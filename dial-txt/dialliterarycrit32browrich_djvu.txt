The English Exploration of America 

We are living in a new period of expansion and great changes on 
the map of the world, such as there has not been since the sixteenth 
and seventeenth centuries. It is interesting at such a time to loolt 
back to the period when our forefathers expanded into this New 
World. The following Old South Leaflets have been added to the series : 

"John Cabot's Discovery of North America," "Sir Francis Drake 
on the California Coast," " Frobisher's First Voyage," "Sir Humph- 
rey Gilbert's Expedition to Newfoundland," "Raleigh's First Roa- 
noke Colony," " Gosnold's Settlement at Cuttyhunk," " Captain John 
Smith's Description of New England," and "Richard Hakluyt's Dis- 
course on Western Planting." 

These leaflets are Nos. 115-122 in the Old South series, which is 
now so large. They are made up from original documents of the 
period, and are all accompanied by careful historical and bibliograph- 
ical notes. Sold for five cents a copy, they place at the service of the 
schools and the public a most important mass of historical papers not 
otherwise easily accessible.

Out-of-door papers written on a New Hampshire farm.

Author of " In Nature's Image," " Sunlight and Shadow," etc. 
This is a book that combines the highest art of 
photography with the best skill of book-making, and, 
above all, the grace, beauty, and suggestion of the 
text make it charming reading. Every person who 
lives in the country, or ever has lived in the country, 
and all who love the beauty of nature, should read it.

Appletons' Recent Fiction 




LOVE'S ITINERARY 

A Romance.

The Artist and the Philistine. 

By Henry B. Fuller, author of «' The Chevalier of 

Pensieri-Vani," " The Cliff Dwellers," etc. 12mo, 

deckle edge, gilt top, !$1 .50. 

The charming: humor, delightful flavor, and refined 
quality of Mr. Fuller's work impart a peculiar zest to this 
subtly satirical picture of the extraordinary vicissitudes 
of arts and letters in Chicago. 

" It is a teasing and irresistible book, sometimes almost 
personal, but persistently good natured and even affec- 
tionate in its satire. Mr. Fuller, who likes a joke at the 
expense of his friends, is equally willing to ' take a fall ' 
out of himself." — Chicago Tribune. 

A Romance for the Holidays and the Year.

The Romance of a Great Sea Fight. 

By Cyrus Townsend Brady, author of " For the

" A brave and stirring tale, admirably constructed, and 
told in excellent style." — Louisville Post. 

" It is a stirring tale, a story of valiant men and lovely 
women, which is bound to add to Mr. Brady's reputation 
as the best writer of sea stories."— Chicago Journal. 

" The story is told with unfailing vivacity and spirit. 
The description of the taking of Quebec is as stirring a bit 
of narrative as one often meets ; and the battle in the bay 
is a remarkably vivid picture of one of the most notable 
naval exploits in history."— Philadelphia Press.

A LINK W ITH THE PAST. 

The transmission of intellectual traits from 
generation to generation is a subject that has 
engaged the attention of many writers. The 
researches in this field of Mr. Francis Galton, 
for example, are widely known, and, while they 
cannot be said to have formulated anything 
like a psychological law of intellectual heredity, 
they have contributed many side-lights to the 
illumination of the subject. There are probably 



no better illustrations of this kind of inheritance 
than are afforded by the annals of New En- 
gland. There are many cases in which intel- 
lectual leadership became a family tradition, 
and in which inherited distinction carried with 
it, as the most sacred of obligations, the man- 
date to keep the torch alight. Since for over 
two centuries the best thought of New England 
was devoted to religious ends, the most con- 
spicuous examples of our intellectual aristocracy 
are to be found in the ranks of the clergy ; 
although, in later generations, education, states- 
manship, and even literature proved to be 
suitable channels for the diversion of energies 
which, in their ancestral manifestations, had 
mainly served the purpose of the Puritan the- 
ology. It would be deeply interesting to collect 
the cases in which the minister's calling de- 
scended, from father to son, through four, five, 
six, or even more generations ; it would be 
deeply interesting, also, to inquire into the 
number of cases in which the forceful intel- 
lects of our own time have sprung from roots 
first planted in the churches of Colonial New 
England. The resulting exhibit would con- 
stitute a peerage of the sort unknown to 
Burke ; it would exemplify that peerage of 
the intellect which alone deserves the respect 
of rational men. 

The family of the Mathers, distinguished 
for four generations, is the example that will 
first occur to the great majority of persons 
whose attention is once directed to this subject. 
But other families are almost equally striking, 
and a moment's reflection will add to the list 
the names of Winthrop, Hale, Lowell, Dana, 
Dwight, and Adams. We doubt if the history 
of any European country, or of England itself, 
can make as remarkable a showing of the per- 
sistence of intellectual force as is made in the 
history of New England by the families already 
named, and the others that might be named 
with them. The ways of heredity are past 
finding out in the present state of our knowl-* 
edge, but it may fairly be said that descent 
from one of these famous stocks creates a rea- 
sonable presumption that the descendant will 
be found possessed of much more than the 
average mental vigor, and will be pretty likely 
to do something toward maintaining the tra- 



6

[Jan. 1, 



dition of his ancestry. In such a descendant 
the manifestation may possibly take a perverted 
form, and will probably take a form that would 
have startled his Puritan forbears, could they 
have foreseen it ; but the transmitted strain will 
contrive to express itself in some fashion, al- 
though it may not be in such fashion as to 
attract widespread attention. 

We have been led to these reflections by 
news of the death, two days before Christmas, 
of William Ellery Channing, the dean of 
American letters for a number of years past, 
and a distinguished member of a family quite 
as remarkable as those which have already been 
mentioned by name. For three generations, 
the Channings have been represented in Ameri- 
can literature. The name was first made famous 
by the great Unitarian divine, William Ellery 
Channing (1780-1842). The foremost Ameri- 
can theologian of his day, and one of the stoutest 
fighters against the evil of slavery, his influence 
as a thinker was felt all over the world, and 
his books were translated into many languages. 
His brother Walter (1786-1876) was a physi- 
cian by calling, a professor at Harvard, and a 
writer of many kinds of books. A third brother, 
Edward Tyrrel (1790-1856), was the Harvard 
professor of rhetoric and oratory to whom so 
many of our nineteenth century writers have 
paid their tribute of affectionate memory. In 
the second generation of Channings, we find 
William Henry, the son of a fourth brother of 
the three named above, and distinguished as 
the Unitarian clergyman who succeeded Mar- 
tineau in his Liverpool pastorate. Then comes 
William Ellery Channing, 2nd (1818-1901), 
the son of Walter, and the occasion of the 
present article. To this generation also belongs 
William Francis, a distinguished physician and 
scientist, the son of the great divine. The third 
generation carries the family tradition for liter- 
ary distinction down to our own years, being now 
represented by Professor Edward Channing of 
Harvard University, whose historical work is 
well known. He is the son of William Ellery, 
and his cousin, Mrs. Grace Ellery Channing- 
Stetson, a poet of creditable achievement, is 
the daughter of William Francis Channing. 

The second William Ellery Channing, who 
^ied the other day at the age of eighty-three, 
had been a resident of Concord off and on for 
nearly sixty years. As the husband of a sister 
of Margaret Fuller, as the close associate of 
Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne, and as 
one of the best-known American poets of half 
a century ago, his life linked the twentieth cen- 



tury with a past that now seems remote indeed, 
not so much for the years that separate us from 
it as for the changes that those years have 
brought in our national ideals. Although he 
broke the silence as recently as 1886 with a 
poem on John Brown, his work was mainly 
done nearer fifty than fifteen years ago, and 
many who took note of his death the other day 
must have learned at the same time with no 
little surprise that he had lived on into the new 
century. How completely he belongs to the 
far distant past may be illustrated by the fact 
that it was nearly sixty years ago that Poe con- 
tributed his contemptuous review of Channing 
to " Graham's Magazine," accusing him of ex- 
hibiting the vices of transcendentalism, and of 
having been " inoculated with virus from Ten- 
nyson," or, in other words, of having " adopted 
and exaggerated that noble poet's characteris- 
tic defect, having mistaken it for his principal 
merit." 

Of the justice or injustice of Poe's charges 
the reader may be allowed to judge from the 
present reproduction of the " Hymn of the 
Earth," one of Channing's best and most 
typical poems. 

" My highway is unfeatured air, 
My consorts are the sleepless Stars, 
And men my giant arms upbear, — 
My arms unstained and free from scars. 

" I rest forever on my way. 
Rolling around the happy Sun; 
My children love the sunny day, 
But noon and night to me are one. 

" My heart has pulses like their own, 
I am their Mother, and my veins, 
Though built of the enduring stone. 
Thrill as do theirs with godlike pains. 

" The forests and the mountains high. 
The foaming ocean and the springs. 
The plains, — O pleasant Company, 
My voice through all your anthem rings I 

'< Ye are so cheerful in your minds, 
Content to smile, content to share : 
My being in your chorus finds 
The echo of the spheral air. 

" No leaf may fall, no pebble roll. 
No drop of water lose the road; 
The issues of the general Soul 
Are mirrored in its round abode." 

In this poem, the Emersonian influence is 
clearly distinguishable, but there seems to be 
no evidence of a Tennysonian inspiration. 
Something of the latter, however, may possibly 
be traced in the following stanza from another 
poem, which is also noteworthy for containing 



1902.] 



THE DIAL 



the one verse of Channing that has gained 
currency as a " familiar quotation." 

"I am not earth-born, though I here delay; 
Hope's child, I summon infiniter powers, 
And laugh to see the mild and sunny day 
Smile on the shrunk and thin autumnal hours; 
I laugh, for hope hath happy place with me, — 
If my bark sinks, 'tis to another sea." 

The list of Channing's writings includes the 
»' Poems " of 1843-47, and -the following vol- 
umes of verse : " The Youth of the Painter," 
" The Woodman," " Near Home," " The 
Wanderer," " Eliot," and "John Brown." Two 
volumes of prose are " Thoreau, the Poet Nat- 
uralist," and " Conversations in Rome." It is 
stated that Channing has left much manuscript 
material which may eventually see the light. 



JOHN BURROUGHS AS PROSE 
WRITER. 



As Mr. Burroughs's tale of work is now very 
considerable, and is little likely to be materially 
increased, we may offer some notes of general ap- 
preciation of his theme and style. 

Mr. Burroughs's true theme is bird-life. Never 
has lived a man more intimate with birds than he. 
" A friend of mine," he says in " Riverby," " picks 
up Indian relics all about the fields ; he has Indian 
relics in his eye. I have seen him turn out of the 
path at right angles, as a dog will when he scents 
something, and walk straight away several rods, 
and pick up an Indian pounding-stone. He saw it 
out of the corner of his eye. I find that without 
conscious effort I see and hear birds with like ease. 
Eye and ear are always on the alert." The in- 
tensity of his devotion may sometimes lead him to 
exaggerate their likeness to humanity, as when he 
remarks : '' Birds show many more human traits than 
do quadrupeds. That they actually fall in love, 
admits of no doubt ; that there is a period of court- 
ship, during which the male uses all the arts he is 
capable of to win his mate, is equally certain ; that 
there are jealousies and rivalries, and that the peace 
of families is often rudely disturbed by outside 
males or females, is a common observation." But 
I have myself seen an English hen-sparrow holding 
a cock by the top-knot, and dangle him clear off 
his feet while her friends punished him with violent 
peckings. 

The charm in bird-life is that they live, unlike 
us, in all three dimensions ; at least, they go up and 
down by no such clumsy contrivances as stairs or 
elevators. Haunting realms as yet unconquered by 
man, they bewitch us with their grace ; but clip 
their wings, and their poetry vanishes. Not the 
ostrich, but the eagle, fires the imagination. The 



flight of birds does not receive as much attention 
from Mr. Burroughs as it might ; although he is 
conversant with all their melodies, and his very best 
writing is on this theme. But are not birds singers 
because they are flyers? Quickly and often hid 
from mates and companions, they acquire the far- 
reaching fetching calls which are musical notes. 
Hence the sweetest singers are not the large birds, 
or sea birds, or prairie birds, but small birds of the 
dense forest, as thrushes, warblers, and vireos. 

Next to birds, Mr. Burroughs is most felicitous 
in characterizing rustic life, animal and human, 
and general aspects of nature, seasonal and diurnal. 
Mark this fine sketch of March weather : 

" This was a typical March day, clear, dry, hard, and 
windy, the river rumpled and crumpled, the sky in- 
tense, distant objects strangely near; a day full of 
strong light, unusual; an extraordinary lightness and 
clearness all around the horizon, as if there were a 
diurnal aurora streaming up and burning through the 
sunlight; smoke from the first spring fires rising up in 
various directions; a day that winnowed the air, and 
left no film in the sky. At night how the big March 
bellows did work ! . . . The stars all seemed brighter 
than usual, as if the wind blew them up like burning 
coals. Venus actually seemed to flare in the wind." 

At its best, the style of Mr. Burroughs is emi- 
nently clear, simple, and forcible. It disdains mere 
polish and urbanity, but it has a pleasant rustic 
tartness. The quiet, peace, and mildness of the 
countryside envelope and pervade ; the simplicity 
and rurality of Petrarch and Seneca prevail. High 
distinction, power, passion, imagination, are lack- 
ing ; but we find much hard Yankee shrewdness 
and common-sense. His muse is pedestrian, and 
often trudges; yet his absolute genuineness, honesty, 
and modesty are so refreshing and engaging that we 
are charmed. 

I believe that Mr. Burroughs conceives himself 
of an order diverse from Thoreau, and critics gen- 
erally distinguish them ; but my impression is that 
he affiliates more closely with Thoreau than with 
any other author. While Mr. Burroughs has not 
the mordant genius, or the stern ever-haunting 
idealism, er the craftmanship of Thoreau, still he 
often writes in Thoreau's vein ; but a single passage 
in illustration must suffice. 

«< One spring morning five swans flew above my barn 
in single file, going northward — an express train bound 
for Labrador. It was a more exhilarating sight than 
if I had seen them in their native haunts. Tbey made 
a breeze in my mind, like a noble passage in a poem. 
How gently their great wings flapped; how easy to fly 
when spring gives the impulse ! On another occasion 
I saw a line of fowls, probably swans, going northward 
at such a height that they appeared like a faint waving 
black line against the sky. They must have been at 
an altitude of two or three miles. I was looking in- 
tently at the clouds to see which way they moved, when 
the birds came into my field of vision. I should never 
have seen them had they not crossed the precise spot 
upon which my eye was fixed. As it was near sundown, 
they were probably launched for an all-night pull.

[Jan. 1, 



They were going with great speed, and as they swayed 
a little this way and that, they suggested a slender, all 
but invisible, aerial serpent cleaving the ether. What 
a highway was pointed out up there ! — an easy grade 
from the Gulf to Hudson's Bay." 

This is Thoreau to the life, in its concise and noble 
simplicity. We might well suspect it of being an 
extract from the " Journals." 

The importance of naturistic writers, among 
whom Mr. Burroughs has a notable place, cannot, of 
course, be compared with that of the humanistic ; for 
humanism is the real goal of man, and naturism but a 
mere sidepath. Dr. Johnson was right in regarding 
Fleet Street as more interesting than Greenwich 
Park. Naturism, as a cult and code and vocation, 
distracts man from the city ; that is, from civiliza- 
tion (civis). But as an avocation, the study of bird- 
life contributes to a noble and broad love of all life, 
and those who have stimulated this study have a 
real function in humanism. Mr. Burroughs does 
this. He inducts us into a real intimacy with bird- 
life in all its sweet intensity, its ceaseless, eager, 
vehement activity, — birds are never, like beasts 
and men, mere loafers, — and he does this without 
scientific assumption, without moonshiny specula- 
tion, and without literary finery.

COMMUNICA TION. 



"PROVEN" FOR "PROVED." 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 
The mail of every week, if not every day, brings to 
the writer assurance of the growing use of what is for 
him a most distressing perversion of our good old En- 
glish speech. The latest ofPense is in Admiral Schley's 
bill of exceptions to the majority findings of the board 
of inquiry: "Which was proven by an overwhelming 
weight of testimony." Not long ago a contributor to The 
Dial was in fault : •' Herein is the immortality of the 
poet Tennyson proven "; and in the current issue of one 
of our better magazines, another magazine which has 
to its credit long years of high usefulness begins an 
advertisement :" During the year just passed, . . . has 
proven more fully than ever." Again, in an editorial 
in what may, perhaps, be called our leading weekly, 
there appeared last week : " But that America has as 
yet no considerable class of such men is proven by varied 
evidences." The inflectional ending en for the past 
participle is an old English form, and is admissible only 
in the case of verbs which have retained it. Prove 
comes from the Latin through the French, and, like 
other foreign verbs, has had only the form proved for 
both past tense and past participle. The use of proven 
is a silly affectation of an unreal archaism. The rhetorics 
are all against it. Lewis says, «' Proven is a Scotch 
legal term." Kittredge says, " The past participle 
proven should be avoided." This sort of instruction 
will have but little effect, if we are constantly to have 
before us such weighty examples to the contrary.

The Making op an American.* 

Jacob Riis, reporter, philanthropist, reformer, 
author of " How the Other Half Lives," needs 
no introduction to the nation whose ideals he 
could scarce honor more highly than he has 
done in calling his autobiography "The Making 
of an American." 

The most striking quality of his book is un- 
doubtedly its artless frankness, which is at first 
in equal measure appalling and delightful. But 
before one has read far, he agrees unqualifiedly 
with that wise friend of Mr. Riis's who told 
him, when he was hesitating over the first 
chapters of his reminiscences, " to take the 
short cut and put it all in." She evidently 
knew her man, understood the absolute unity 
of purpose that ran through every act of his 
life, and felt how fatal it would be should his 
readers miss seeing that here is a man whose 
house of life has no back doors and no alley 
windows. The whole of Mr. Riis is in his book, 
then, and the real Mr. Riis. He is " speaking 
right on " in words that have no fictitious lime- 
light glare about them, and little of the grace 
of artful manipulation ; but they are plain- 
speaking words, whose charm is that they are 
instinct with the thrill and throb of life, with 
the joy of labor and the pathos of joy. " The 
Making of an American " is the work of a 
man who deals not with words per se, but with 
the things behind the words. It is the work 
of a man, too, who never forgets his past in his 
present, nor loses sight of his defeat because 
he has turned it into a victory. So the second 
remarkable thing about Mr. Riis's book is that 
ftvery page of it is alive. 

And why did the son of a Danish school- 
master in the sleepy little old town of Ribe, 
want to become an American ? Because Elisa- 
beth, now his " silver bride," had jilted him, 
out of respect to her father's very natural 
scruples about his eligibility as a son-in-law. 
Here was a boy who seemed to have no sense 
of the fitness of things, who preferred carpentry 
to schooling, and who during the short time he 
had spent at his books had been interested in 
no study but English, and that only in order 
to read Charles Dickens's paper, " All the 
Year Round." In view of what followed it 
was very fortunate that the Riis family sub-

THE DIAL 



scribed to " All the Year Round." The boy 
Jacob's first years in America were difficult 
enough without the additional hardship that 
absolute ignorance of the "American lan- 
guage" would have involved. 

He landed in New York at the age of twenty- 
one, with the vaguest notion of what he meant 
to do next, but with plenty of youthful assur- 
ance that Providence would provide for him 
somehow, if he only gave her a fair chance. 

" Of course I had my trade to fall back on, but I am 
afraid that is all the use I thought of putting it to. The 
love of change belongs to youth, and I meant to take a 
band in things as they came along. I had a pair of 
strong hands, and stubbornness enough to do for two; 
also a strong belief that in a free country, free from 
the dominion of custom, of caste, as well as of men, 
things would somehow come right in the end, and a man 
get shaken into the corner where he belonged if he 
took a hand in the game. I think I was right in that." 

The confirmatory sentence comes easily now, 
but his trust in the ultimate justice of a democ- 
racy must have been strained well-nigh to 
breaking in the six years' struggle that fol- 
lowed. The first two years were spent literally 
in taking " a hand in things as they came 
along," — in putting up miners' huts on the 
Allegheny, working in clay-bank and brick- 
yard, as wood-chopper, trapper, hired man, 
carpenter, ship-builder, and peddler. Between 
jobs the young Dane was a homeless, often 
penniless, wanderer, a tramp except at heart. 
But he never lost hope ; instead he faced life 
with a smile and bided his time for setting 
right the injustices done him and others like 
him. He tells of one awful night spent in a 
station house in New York City, when he was 
robbed, and the only friend he had in America, 
a little black-and-tan terrier, was maliciously 
killed before his eyes. 

" The outrage of that night became, in the providence 
of God, the means of putting an end to one of the foulest 
abuses that ever disgraced a Christian city, and a main- 
spring in the battle with the slum as far as my share in 
it is concerned." 

Thus Mr. Riis made acquaintance with Mul- 
berry Street and the Five Points, in a fashion 
that was later to give sting and poignancy to 
the police-reporter's attitude toward them. To 
these years also can be traced his ambition to 
be a reporter. Writing of his second winter in 
America, he says : 

" It was about this time that I made up my mind to 
go into the newspaper business. It seemed to me that 
a reporter's was the highest of all callings; no one could 
sift wrong from right as he, and punish the wrong. In 
that I was right. I have not changed my opinion on 
that point one whit, and I am sure I never shall. The 
power of fact is the mightiest lever of this or of any day. 



The reporter has his hand upon it, and it is his grievous 
fault if he does not use it well." 

Jacob Riis has apparently wasted very little 
time changing his mind. It would take too 
long to tell how he won Elisabeth through 
sheer conviction that he could not do without 
her, and how for a precisely similar reason, by 
the hard road of under-pay and over-work, he 
finally got a staff appointment at Police Head- 
quarters, on the New York "Tribune." 

Now began the real work of his life, for 
which everything hitherto had been a sort of 
preparation. Mulberry Street was his chance 
both from a professional and a philanthropic 
point of view. There were hostile police to 
circumvent and rival reporters to beat; there 
were all the woes of the Other Half to be re- 
ported in the big sense — which is always Mr. 
Riis's sense — of the word. He prayed that 
he might do his work well and then he " dived 
in," bent on exploiting the facts in which he 
trusted, determined to tell each story of shame 
and crime so that beneath the "foulness and 
the reek of blood " his readers might " see its 
meaning, or at all events catch the human drift 
of it." 

In this spirit he began his career as police- 
reporter. On its professional side it immedi- 
ately resolved itself into " a ten years' war," 
out of which the despised "Dutchman" came 
with what he tells us is the only renown he ever 
coveted, " that of being the ' boss reporter ' in 
Mulberry Street." The " battlesome account " 
of those stirring days is full of good stories of 
the ups and downs, the set-backs and triumphs, 
of the fray. The one perhaps which best proves 
Mr. Riis's oft-repeated assertion that the true re- 
porter is a man of power, having absolutely noth- 
ing in common with the ubiquitous, sensation- 
loving nuisance who sometimes bears the name, 
is the story of his famous trip up the Croton 
water-shed. The printed report of what he saw, 
confirmed by photographs, made a sensation, 
but it was not sensational. It was fact, and 
the result was an unpolluted water-supply for 
New York City. Incidentally the disclosure 
of the imminent possibility of a cholera epi- 
demic was one of the biggest " beats " on 
record. 

" Beats " alone, however, did not satisfy Mr. 
Riis ; he remembered his dog and he wanted 
to settle with Mulberry Bend, through which 
he walked home between one and four o'clock 
every morning. 

" There were cars on the Bowery, but I liked to walk, 
for so I saw the slum when off its guard. The instinct

to pose is as strong there as on Fifth Avenue. It is a 
human impulse, I suppose. . . . But at 3 A. M. the 
veneering is off and you see the true grain of a thing. 
So, also, I got a picture of the Bend upon my mind 
which so soon as I should be able to transfer it to that

according to its deserts. It was not fit for Christian men 
and women, let alone innocent children, to live in, and 
therefore it had to go. So with the police lodging- 
rooms, some of the worst of which were right there. . . . 
The way of it never gave me any concern that I remem- 
ber. That would open as soon as the truth was told. 
The trouble was that people did not know and had no 
means of finding out for themselves. But I had." 

Delightfully Platonic, this trust in the power 
of truth to make men free ; but it is not ad- 
vanced as a general proposition, and it was 
justified. There were those who had ears to 
hear — the Charity Organization Society, the 
City Health Department, the King's Daughters, 
the various social settlements and tenement 
commissions, above all President Koosevelt of 
the Police Board and the rest of the Strong 
administration, — and they put themselves at 
the other end of the line, the organized, ad- 
ministrative end, whose value Mr. Riis fully 
appreciated, though he never meddled with it 
much. 

"To represent is not my business. To write is; I 
can do it much better and back up the other, so we are 
two for one. ... I value the good opinion of my 
fellow-men, for with it comes increased power to do 
things. But I would reserve the honors for those who 
have fairly earned them, and on whom they set easy. 
They don't on me. I am not ornamental by nature." 

Nor did he care to be ornamental. Always 
a worker, he wished to be known as one who 
worked well ; after that to avenge the death of 
a little black- and-tan dog. This, it seemed 
to him, could best be done by letting light and 
air into the slums whose spiritual darkness and 
foulness had killed his dog, — by bringing to 
them the flowers of the fields, by planting 
small parks there to be bits of God's country 
in a godless place, by establishing decent 
schools and pleasant play-grounds, which are 
the children's rights. How he " sat up with 
his club," the fact, until these reforms were 
achieved, is the story that makes up the last 
half of his autobiography. 

" I would not have missed being in it all for 
anything." That sentence strikes the keynote 
of the impression which Mr. E-iis's book leaves 
with the reader. If its frankness and virility 
are singular, no less so is its unassuming opti- 
mism, its keen sense of the joy of combat, of 
the infinite interest and inestimable value of a 
life lived honestly and with purpose. Every 
journalist who is weighted with a sense of the 



futility of newspaper work, passing, as it does, 
into innocuous desuetude with the next "extra," 
should read this book. He can scarcely fail 
to get from it an inspiration that will make 
him view his responsibilities in their largeness 
and take up his " club," the fact, with new 
purpose to wield it well. But the thesis has a 
wider application. To " hitch your wagon to 
a star," to make cosmic connections, to see 
each little day as an important item in a big 
account, is a philosophy that will ennoble every 
worker. And Mr. Riis's contribution to its 
literature is of special value because he shows 
its practical bearing, freights it with no isms 
nor ologies, combines it with a very human 
sense of the importance, not of martyrdom, 
but of success ; and best of all, perhaps, tinges 
it with a delightful sense of humor. His qual- 
ity as a humorist and a charming raconteur^ 
with a full fund of racy anecdotes about him- 
self and his friends, each reader must enjoy 
for himself. It has been the purpose of this 
review to show the motives which made his 
game of life seem worth while to him, and, 
from his point of view, gave his autobiography 
its excuse for being.

The Financiering of the 
Confederacy.* 



There has been a sort of poetic glamor cast 
over the struggle for "the lost cause" which 
has fascinated the mind of even so matter-of- 
fact a man as the economic historian. This is 
doubtless a partial explanation of the fact 
that while great portions of the economic and 
financial history of "the United States of 
America " are almost untrodden fields, so con- 
scientious an investigator as Professor Schwab 
has undertaken the task of furnishing us with 
a careful and comprehensive study of the 
financial and industrial history of the short- 
lived " Confederate States of America." 

The economic history of the Confederacy 
centres about the efforts made by Southern 
statesmen and financiers to secure the means 
of carrying on the war. Under the wisest 
administration of fiscal affairs, this would have 
been a most difficult problem. The desire to 
prove the advantages of slavery as an indus- 
trial system had led ante-helium writers in the

South to boast of the wealth of the Slave 
States and to compare the resources of this 
part of the country with those of the North, 
to the invariable detriment of the latter. The 
fact remains that the South was industrially 
far weaker than the North, and such resources 
as she did possess, in her agricultural lauds 
and her slaves, were unfitted to bear the strain 
of a long war or to furnish to the government 
the income necessary to prosecute the struggle. 
Memminger of South Carolina, who was 
selected by President Davis as the first Secre- 
tary of the Treasury, and whose name is likely 
to be as permanently identified with the Con- 
federate fiscal policy as that of Chase is with 
the fiscal policy of the Federal government at 
this time, was not fitted either by training or 
ability for the position which he occupied ; and 
his administration met with no considerable 
success. Perhaps no man could have made a 
success of Confederate finances under the cir- 
cumstances, and with the ideas in regard to 
finance then prevailing among the people ; but 
Secretary Memminger cannot entirely escape 
the responsibility for the fiscal policy actually 
adopted. 

" We miss in him the ability to foresee the inevitable 
consequences of the measures be proposed, and the 
power to assume leadership by winning the confidence 
of the Congress and their cooperation in framing a 
policy that should have secured the fullest use of the 
resources of the South instead of one that dissipated 
and deranged them. A financier of like talent to that 
of the Southern military leaders would doubtless have 
conducted the affairs of the treasury with more success," 

In accordance with the usual practice of 
modern governments, the Secretary and Con- 
gress planned from the very first to place more 
reliance on loans than on taxes, — though it is 
important here to note that, in making pro- 
visions for the first loan, the Confederate Con- 
gress voted that an export duty be laid, the 
proceeds of which were consistently devoted to 
the payment of the interest on these early 
bonds. As a consequence, these bonds all 
through the war were quoted at a higher figure 
than the later issues. The first loan of 
$15,000,000 was successfully floated, though 
it caused a suspension of specie payments in 
certain quarters. 

The inevitable issue of Treasury notes began 
on March 9, 1861, and from this time on this 
measure was frequently resorted to. Intended 
at first as only a temporary expedient, it soon 
became almost the sole reliance of the Treasury 
for funds to carry on the war. That this 
would be the inevitable outcome, the experience 



of other governments had clearly shown ; yet 
some excuse may be found for the Secretary 
and Congress in the fact that this was the 
most popular as well as the expected method 
of raising the revenue. Bonds did not prove 
popular, and, while a produce loan attempted 
during the first year of the war met with some 
success as a means of raising revenue, it led 
to a demand on the part of the cotton planters, 
who were unable on account of the blockade to 
market their crop, that the government should 
purchase the entire cotton crop in Treasury 
notes made legal tender. Memminger at first 
hesitated, but, finally convinced that this meas- 
ure would result in the complete ruin of the 
credit of the government, he advised against it. 
Before the end of 1861, the Confederacy was 
irretrievably committed to the policy of forced 
loans, in the shape of non-interest-bearing 
Treasury notes, as the chief fiscal reliance of 
the government. Apart from an insignificant 
customs duty, no provision had been made for 
taxation. 

The year 1862 brought no improvement in 
the condition of affairs or in the methods pur- 
sued by Congress and the Secretary. No 
taxes were levied, and further issues of notes 
were resorted to. Futile efforts were made to 
prevent the currency from becoming redundant, 
by making the notes and bonds interchangable. 
This only increased the redundancy ; for debtors 
wished notes to pay debts, and bonds were ex- 
changed for the notes. Finally, in September, 
a sweeping provision was made which allowed 
the issue of bonds and notes to an unlimited 
amount whenever needed to pay government 
expenses. Strenuous efforts were made to bor- 
row abroad on the security of the cotton and 
tobacco secured from the produce loans ; and 
these efforts met with some success, though, as 
the speculation in cotton grew, the planters 
were unwilling to part with their cotton in ex- 
change for the bonds. Agents of the Con- 
federate government were sent to Europe, and 
in December, 1862, two of these agents suc- 
ceeded in floating bonds on the basis of cotton 
as a pledge. The bonds could be exchanged 
for cotton delivered within ten miles of a railway 
station within the Confederate States during 
the war. The French banking house of Er- 
langer & Cie. took the work of floating a loan 
of 116,000,000, and would have liked to have 
a larger loan, so great was the demand for 
cotton in Europe. In spite of the risky char- 
acter of the investment, the " London Econo- 
mist " rated these bonds higher than Federal

securities, and the fifteen millions of dollars 
were subscribed five times over. The quota- 
tions went as high as 95 ; but after the Federal 
victories of 1863 the price fell. Years after 
the war was over, the foreign holders of these 
bonds had their hopes raised that the bonds 
would be redeemed by the government of the 
United States, or by that of some Southern 
State, or from funds of the Confederate gov- 
ernment supposed to be in some bank in Eu- 
rope. The loss to European investors in these 
bonds, Professor Schwab estimates at $9,750,- 
000 ; while the profits to the Confederacy he 
considers to have been not more than $1,283,- 
930. 

The failure of note-holders to convert their 
notes into bonds led Secretary Memminger to 
recommend, and Congress to pass, certain 
measures intended to make funding compul- 
sory, and which virtually meant repudiation. 
The measures did not accomplish their purpose, 
and the decline in the value of the notes was 
much more rapid. Funding soon ceased. 
Prices in 1863 and 1864 rose to prodigious 
figures. In this latter year. Congress, acting 
on the advice of both President Davis and 
Secretary Memminger, began an admitted vio- 
lation of contracts, and actual repudiation, by 
taxing out of existence the notes which their 
holders refused to exchange for bonds. This 
measure, which caused the complete wreck of 
the Confederate credit, failed of its purpose — 
the prevention of a further fall in prices. 
Memminger resigned in June, and was fol- 
lowed by Secretary Trenholm, who sought in 
vain to restore public confidence by advocating 
the repeal of the repudiation measures and the 
adoption of a policy of raising revenue through 
taxation. Congress refused to adopt these 
recommendations, and the closing days of the 
Confederacy are marked by the creation of a 
large floating debt and by government specu- 
lation in specie, while little attempt was made 
to keep up the arrears. 

In the matter of legal-tender legislation, the 
Confederate government avoided the mistaken 
policy of the government at the North, no 
Confederate Congress having actually adopted 
this expedient. It would be wrong to refuse 
credit to whom it is due, and it is due to Mem- 
minger in this instance to state that he strenu- 
ously opposed a legal-tender act in 1861, and 
again in 1862 ; and it is also proper to credit 
the Confederate Congress with having stead- 
fastly refused to be carried away by the same 
arguments as at this time convinced Secretary 



Chase and the Northern Congress. Candor 
compels the further statement, however, that 
the fact that no other currency than the Con- 
federate notes existed in the South made the 
supposed gains from a legal-tender act much 
less than in the North. The legal-tender acts 
of various Southern States, and the desperate 
funding measures of the Confederate Congress 
in 1863 and 1864, make it highly probable 
that the same Congress would have adopted a 
legal-tender act if there had been any hope of 
raising the value of the depreciated notes by 
so doing. 

Instructive, entertaining, almost amusing, is 
the history of the Confederate currency and 
its effect upon prices. Whether or not it was 
the only fiscal resource that could have been 
employed by the Confederate government, it 
is certainly true that it was the one adopted in 
response to public demand ; and that it was 
public demand, as well as fiscal exigencies, that 
caused one issue of notes to follow another. 
In March, 1865, the gold dollar was worth 
$65 in Confederate currency, while the rise 
in the currency price of commodities was in 
most cases even greater than the rise in the 
price of gold. Professor Schwab has made a 
careful study and comparison of both Northern 
and Southern prices during the war ; but the 
results of his investigation, best shown in his 
tables, cannot be adequately given here. 

The example set by the central government 
in the matter of note-issue was imitated by the 
State governments in the South, by the mu- 
nicipal corporations, and even by private cor- 
porations and business firms. Added to these 
issues were counterfeit notes, the genuine notes 
shading off into the counterfeit so that the 
issue of the latter was scarcely resisted and but 
little condemned. It is perhaps the most 
unfortunate consequence of the issue of an 
irredeemable paper currency, that this deviation 
from the path of strict business integrity on 
the part of the government is reflected in the 
lowering of the moral tone of the people. The 
redundant currency in the South encouraged 
speculation, and speculation encouraged gam- 
bling of all sorts. Gambling was prevalent in 
all the large cities as well as in the army, and 
other kinds of vice accompanied it. 

" Ruffians, thieves, and prostitutes abounded, and vice 
in every form became common. Ttie South from this 
point of view does not present an attractive picture, 
which is only matched by the description of the social 
conditions prevailing at the time of similar upheavals 
in other countries, — for instance, in France during the 
last decade of the eighteenth century."

It is pleasant to be able to record that in a 
time when business morality was at a low ebb, 
and both the law and public opinion favored 
the debtor class, especially if the creditor hap- 
pened to be a Northern man, not all debtors 
took advantage of the opportunity offered of 
escaping the payment of their obligations. 
The bankers and merchants of New Orleans 
deserve especial mention for having refused 
to repudiate their contracts, and for insisting 
on paying their obligations to their Northern 
correspondents in full. ^ g Hammond. 



The Secret of Shakespeare.* 

Years ago, Lowell, writing about Shakes- 
peare, implied an apology in the title of his 
essay, " Shakespeare Once More "; and yet 
books are still being written about the world's 
master-poet without our having yet come to 
the feeling that the subject is exhausted. In 
the latest contribution to the study of his 
message and his art, " What is Shakespeare ? " 
by Professor L. A. Sherman of the University 
of Nebraska, the problem of reaching an un- 
derstanding of his significance for us, of mak- 
ing him potent as an element in our culture, 
is approached in an altogether new fashion. 
It is the author's belief that Shakespeare is 
not for the student alone, but as well for all 
who will put themselves in the way of receiving 
his inspiration. If this is true, the problem 
becomes at once a question of training in in- 
sight ; since certainly, without some sort of 
preparation, the great mass of those who are 
reading to-day will not enjoy Shakespeare. 
Neither will they, or the special student, enjoy 
him if they are to come to an understanding of 
him only through detailed explanation from 
someone else. Pleasure in any literary product 
comes, not in knowing, but in divining ; not 
in reaching a conclusion, but in following the 
steps to the conclusion. 

Professor Sherman's book, then, is not an 
attempt to explain Shakespeare, to find in him 
new depths of wisdom, to make us see the man 
afresh in his work. It is, instead, an attempt 
to make it possible for the reader — any reader 
— to come into direct personal relations with 
Shakespeare without the intervention of an 
interpreter. Following out this purpose. Sec- 
tion I. is given to a brief discussion of the 

•What is Shakespeare? By L. A. Sherman. New 
York : The Macmillan Go. 



subject ; after which, in Section II., there 
comes a running interpretation of the spiritual 
significance and the art of " Cymbeline." 
Professor Sherman's scholarly sureness, his 
keenly psychological gift of analysis, his ready 
grasp of the spiritual potency of character and 
dramatic situation, find here very satisfying 
expression. The treatment of the play, extend- 
ing to over a hundred pages, is as full, as 
minutely critical, as sympathetic and human, 
as anyone could well wish. All this is, of 
course, in the way of preparation for what the 
reader is afterwards to do for himself with 
other plays. The discussion takes up such 
matters as might or should come into the 
mind of any discerning reader, — matters of 
real human interest, not questions of date, op 
of position in the order of development of 
Shakespeare's powers, or of other things that 
have a curious interest only. At every step 
the reader learns how to divine by following 
the process of divination in another. 

Sections III. and IV. are concerned with a 
much less exhaustive treatment of " The 
Winter's Tale " and " Eomeo and Juliet," it 
being assumed that with a little help the stu- 
dent can now realize Shakespeare's ultimate 
meanings for himself, and find pleasure in so 
doing. Section V. takes up the question of 
" Shakespeare's Dramatic Art," illustrating it 
in the main from the handling of character 
and plot in " Macbeth." We have been made 
to feel something of Shakespeare's greatness 
as an artist in the preceding pages ; but here 
this becomes more luminously real. It is a 
part of the moving power of Professor Sher- 
man's handling of his theme, that human in- 
terest, vital meanings, and technical skill ofthe 
artist, are brought before us together as ac- 
cordant elements of one supremely great literary 
whole. It adds greatly to our relish of a play 
to follow the author as he shapes its meaning 
into satisfying and compelling artistic forms. 

A little less than fifty pages are then de- 
voted to " Shakespeare the Man," a showing 
of about all that is really known of him, written 
from the view-point of a charitable under- 
standing of some of the doubtful things of his 
life, things which have generally been inter- 
preted in less kindly fashion. This, and the 
two concluding sections of the book on the 
" Groupings of the Plays " and " Personal 
Study of the Plays," are in the way of direct 
giving of information, but it is information 
which the reader may properly wish to gain at 
second-hand. Time spent in acquiring it for

one's self would be given to consideration of 
externals, not to getting at the heart of Shake- 
speare. An appendix contains questions on 
" The Winter's Tale," " Romeo and Juliet," 
and " Twelfth Night," of the sort which the 
author has made familiar to English teachers 
throughout the country. 

It will be at once apparent that the book is 
a working tool for students and inquirers, 
rather than an effort to make literary capital 
out of a great heritage of the English race. 
If it were to be read merely for its own sake 
rather than for its helpfulness, the plan of 
treatment might very properly be criticised, 
since the different subjects are more or less 
detached, and they certainly do not follow one 
another in any definite order of logical devel- 
opment or of increasing interest. Indeed, the 
concluding portions seem to be, even more than 
was needful, a gathering up of unrelated matters 
which it may merely be convenient to have at 
hand. In comparison with such a work as 
that of George Brandes, it of course seems in- 
complete ; the rich glow of the latter, its showing 
of a brilliant life giving expression to the 
greatest range of poetry shaped from the most 
varied experience, is lacking. But only the 
scholar familiar with all that Shakespeare 
wrote can follow Brandes with steady and in- 
telligent interest. The reader who wishes to 
obtain at second-hand as much knowledge of 
Shakespeare as he can in a short time, or who 
would satisfy his soul with a string of grace- 
fully phrased sentiments and critical opinions, 
will be disappointed in the book. There are 
other books that serve such a purpose better ; 
but for the earnest reader really desirous of 
commg to fellowship with the world's greatest 
mind, we have had few books more truly helpful.

Recent American Diplomacy.* 



The two books reviewed in this article deal 
with timely and pressing issues in an interest- 
ing way, and, in some instances, from different 
if not opposite points of view. 

Mr. Henderson's work, which may be first 
considered, is an exposition of five " questions ": 
The Fur Seals and the Bering Sea Award, 
the Interoceanic Canal Problem, the United 

* American Diplomatic Questions. By John B. Hen- 
derson, Jr. New York : The Macmillan Co.

States and Samoa, the Monroe Doctrine, and 
the North East Coast Fisheries. 

It is made clear by the author that in the 
Bering Sea controversy the United States^ 
under color of Russian imperial documents, 
partly forged, vainly asserted the right to ap- 
propriate a vast expanse of open navigable 
ocean, in total conflict with the motive and 
reason of its great struggle in the early part of 
the century for the freedom of the high seas 
of the world. By the arbitrators we were con- 
victed of numerous wrongful and violent visi- 
tations and captures on the public seas, inflicted 
upon the ships and crews of a friendly power 
— the power against which, in 1812, we had 
declared war for similar acts of invasion 
against ourselves. " It is to be regretted," 
says Mr. Henderson, " that in this matter the 
United States should have appeared before the 
tribunal and the civilized world in the unfor- 
tunate light of taking a step backward in order 
to resuscitate and reclothe a defunct doctrine." 
That the United States, by cession from Eussia, 
could take nothing in the main oceans not the 
common possession of all nations was a decree 
of the arbitrators fully justified in American 
organic law and international practice. 

As to our relations with Samoa under the 
Berlin Treaty of 1889, it is said that their 
history reveals the first genuine instance of 
departure from a time-honored policy of non- 
intervention in the domestic affairs of alien 
nations. Elsewhere it is shown, as was shown 
a hundred years before, that this rule of non- 
intervention is based upon a fundamental prin- 
ciple of the American State. In this novel 
treaty entered into with Great Britain and 
Germany, it is said that the signatories assumed 
the responsibility of policing the internal af- 
fairs and external relations of a people " not 
accepted as members of our Union and in whose 
interests we had, as a nation, not the least 
concern." We are told in rapid and lifelike 
narrative of the inevitable incidents of this 
form of world-power. We read of many flag- 
raisings, some by American consuls and naval 
officers, some by Germans, and others again 
by the greatest of all flag-raisers, the British 
Empire. We read of a great British firm, 
personifying, for the time being, the " inter- 
ests " of that Empire ; also of a still greater 
commercial body styling itself Godeffroy and 
Company, a largely capitalized German con- 
cern in its later state boasting the rather com- 
prehensive corporate name of the Deutsche 
Handels- undPlantagen- GesellschaftfiirSud-

see-Inseln zu Hamburg. It would seem that 
upon the appearance of this ponderous example 
of organized wealth among those tropical palm- 
groves the primacy of Germany in the trio of 
depredators became a mere question of time. 
In the sequel the time proved to be ten years. 
But for that decade of impossibility, sorrow, 
and bloodshed, we read of many confusions 
and outbreaks, intensified by independent or 
cooperative fusillades and naval bombardments 
of the sea coast Samoan villages. The end of 
our share of this triangular pandemonium was 
accomplished, as had been its beginning, by 
an exercise of the treaty-making power. The 
treaty of 1899 is a diplomatic document which 
a repentant American statesman might peruse 
with a mournful sigh of relief. Mr. Henderson 
refers to it as marking " the final episode of 
American complicity in Samoan affairs." Even 
Professor Hart thinks " the Colonial system as 
applied in Samoa farcical "; and he says also 
that " the United States has for more than a 
hundred years been a great Colonial power 
without suspecting it." The existence of this 
century of colonial power is explained further 
on in Professor Hart's book. 

Mr. Henderson is moved to give us this en- 
tire treaty of 1899, with its signatures by our 
Secretary of State and the German and British 
Ambassadors Extraordinary and Plenipoten- 
tiary. We have hardly space for the surmise 
that our Secretary probably demanded and 
secured the insertion of Article III. in which 
is embodied the Golden Rule of Diplomacy, 
Equal Rights to All the signatory confederates. 
The chief value of Samoa as one of our diplo- 
matic precedents must always be found, not in 
our military and mercantile successes over the 
weak and defenseless, not in the promotion of 
" interests " which followed or preceded the 
flag of our country, but rather in the deeply 
impressive moral lesson that neither vanity nor 
passion nor yet self-interest could suffice to 
postpone longer the necessary measure of re- 
treat from an unprincipled invasion. To those 
who think they find in flowers culled from the 
anthologies of history a surer precept for human 
guidance than that felt in the impulse of the 
personal conscience, the epic of our Samoan 
Colony will read as something deeper than a 
farce. That colonization was tried in Samoa 
and found wanting is also history, and might 
have been foretold upon elementary canons of 
divination. 

The topic to which Mr. Henderson gives the 
largest attention is not Samoa, but the Monroe 



Doctrine. These are among the conclusions 
reached by him : In reality the doctrine was 
only a new name for the right of self-protection; 
a principle as old as man himself, called into 
expression by apprehension of European ag- 
gression in the Americas. " The Spanish 
possessions were in revolt and offered a tempt- 
ing field for the exploitation of European arms. 
The American people were impressed with a 
sense of danger in every European advance "; 
the doctrine " voiced that apprehension in a 
way that satisfied every American citizen." 
The author feels no apprehension that our 
people will not remain " alert and watchful of 
their own interests." " Higher principles than 
devotion to the Monroe Doctrine will guide — 
principles of an organic law upon which the 
Monroe Doctrine is founded and of which the 
Monroe Doctrine was but a single expression." 
In Professor Hart's " Foundations of Amer- 
ican Foreign Policy " is presented a conception 
of America as a " World Power " very dif- 
ferent from that implied, if not asserted, by 
Mr. Henderson. The first care of the author 
is to disprove the groundless charge of " iso- 
lation." The truth concerning the accusation 
is fearlessly retold. We are not, never have 
been, isolated. The question when and how 
to exercise American influence in the counsels 
of the nations has never been one of prerog- 
ative, but of expediency reserved to the judg- 
ment of our public men. The key to our foreign 
policy is not in any formula or maxim of 
statecraft, but in deep principles of human in- 
terest. Our diplomatic history shows that 
" the government has never hesitated to assert 
itself anywhere on the globe if its interests 
seemed sufficient." " In such a crisis as that 
of 1898, therefore, the United States took 
no new position, but re-asserted what history 
shows had never been abandoned — the place 
of a world-power." " All the discussion on 
the future policy of the United States really 
comes down to the question whether it is to the 
National interest to go far afield in new enter- 
prises." The author considers our recent 
military operations against Spain as " justified

appear " abnormal." " To seize islands, to sub- 
vert long-established colonial governments," 
" to distribute dynamite shells among malcon- 
tents " — all these exercises of our " latent 
prerogatives in international concerns" seem 
to many minds to have been " an aggressive 
departure from our National Policy." This 
to the author is an unhistorical error. We

Americans live so fast " that we run away from 
our own history." To recall the absent-minded 
reader to his own country he is pointed to the 
" precedents," more than sixty in number, of 
" actual or authorized use of force outside our 
National jurisdiction." These instances, in- 
cluding the War of the Revolution, the War of 
1812, and every other big or little American 
war, are apparently made the basis of the in- 
ference that the War of 1898 was not "ab- 
normal." 

There is among Professor Hart's other sug- 
gestive titles a chapter upon " Brother Jon- 
athan's Colonies." The author asks : " What 
is the essential conception of a colony ? Is it 
anything more than a tract of territory sub- 
ordinate to the inhabitants of a different tract 
of country and ruled by authorities wholly or 
in part responsible to the main administration 
instead of to the people of their own region ? " 
Since 1784, we have always had such colonies 
side by side with us as the ruling nation, 
" only we have chosen to call them ' terri- 
tories.' " Thus Illinois and many others of 
our States were once " Colonies." If so, it 
would seem that they must have been colonies 
in the special sense in which the ruler abdicates 
in advance. By many this generalization of the 
term " colony " will be deemed a forced one. 

Professor Hart's work is a revised collection 
of recent magazine articles and is supplemented 
by an index and a bibliography likely to be of 
great use to those seeking information upon 
the momentous questions of vast human in- 
terest recently and suddenly projected upon 
the field of American public and private life. 
As ever before, the first to arrive on the ground

Heneik Ibsen.* 



It may be that the estimate of Dr. Ibsen 
made by conservative critics is fully as high 
to-day as it was twelve years ago, or even 
higher. But it is certain that he occupies a 
less conspicuous place in the eye of the general 
reading public than he once did. The waves 
and the billows of the novels with first editions 
of fifty thousand and first year sales of five

hundred thousand have gone over him. The 
few years of distance have lessened the degrees 
of his arc on the horizon. Yet, of course, this 
does not diminish his true importance, nor 
give any suggestion whereby better to judge 
his permanent value. The high tides and the 
surges hide temporarily many a solid crag 
that will look out for centuries above the 
fluctuant waters. 

But the fact that we are beginning to get 
away slightly from the first fever of the great 
Norwegian's triumph, out of the clutches of 
the Ibsen cult, suggests that the time is at 
hand when rational judgments can be formed, 
when the average person may trust himself to 
investigate and have an opinion for himself. 
Whether Dr. Ibsen will be one of the true lit- 
erary immortals, one among the select few, 
may still be an open question in the minds of 
well-informed and critical persons. But there 
can be no question that he has been a tre- 
mendous force in modern literature during the 
last half of the nineteenth century, that he is 
a writer of extraordinary originality, and that 
he has reflected in his writings the peculiar 
phases and problems of latter-day men and 
society. This means that no well-informed 
person can afford to be without a reasonable 
knowledge of the man and the scope and ten- 
dency of his works and a first-hand acquaint- 
ance with some portion of his product. 

To this end the re-publication of Mr. Payne's 
translation of Jager's literary biography of 
Dr. Ibsen will be welcomed. What remained 
of the first edition of the work, which appeared 
in 1890, was destroyed in the McClurg fire 
three years ago. This, together with the fact 
that six important dramas had appeared since 
that earlier publication, made a new edition 
doubly desirable. Mr. Payne has written ac- 
counts of these six later dramas, and united 
them into a final chapter, which brings the 
biography down to " The End of the History," 
so far as the account of the author's printed 
works goes. 

As the title of the book indicates, this is an 
account of Dr. Ibsen's literary works strung 
in the order of their appearance upon the 
thread of his personal career. The accounts 
are just what such reviews ought to be. Per- 
haps they do not leave enough room for com- 
parison among themselves and with the works 
of standard writers. Perhaps, too, the details 
of the man's life are here and there too full. 
But in the main these details throw light upon 
the dramas. Mr. Payne's translation stands

the excellent test that there is no conscious 
jolt when the reader runs from the last chapter 
of the original to the one which is wholly Mr. 
Payne's own composition. The bibliographical 
notes in the Prefaces are useful, and might 
well have been extended. One is surprised to 
find no allusion to Jager's own later book, 
" Henrik Ibsen and his Works," which ap- 
peared in 1892. 

The volume is handsomely printed and sup- 
plied with five portraits of Ibsen, one of his 
wife, and other illustrations.

Kecent Fictiox.* 



" Sir Richard Calmady " came to us heralded by 
80 loud a chorus of praise from the other side of 
the Atlantic that we were prepared to give it a 
cordial welcome, and it was with no little satisfac- 
tion that we found its pages to numher nearly seven 
hundred. We are of those who, recalling the ample 
dimensions of many a work of modern fiction, from 
Thackeray to Sienkiewicz, believe that a really good 
novel cannot be too long, and since " Sir Richard 
Calmady " proves itself to be a really good novel, 
its length counts among its conspicuous merits. 
"Lucas Malet" has done good work before this, 
upon a lesser scale, — provokingly good work, in 
the sense that its possibilities always seemed to be 
better than its achievement. At last, she has given 
herself full swing, and the result is a work that 
must be reckoned with as a contribution to serious 
literature. To avoid misunderstandings, we hasten 
to say that it is not a novel of tendency, it has no 
thesis to maintain, it is simply a rich picture of 
human life, as presented in the relations of a small 
group of people, the chief of whom is so abnormal 
an individual that it is no small triumph to have so 
delineated his character that sympathetic interest gets 
the better of natural repulsion, making us acquiesce 
in an outcome which at the start we should be in- 
clined to reject as monstrous. To put it briefly. Sir

Richard comes into the world horribly deformed : 
his lower limbs are shortened to half the natural 
length ; his whole history is a struggle to make life 
^eem endurable under such appallingly adverse 
conditions ; and in the end it is made more than 
endurable by the love of a woman whose physical 
endowment is as superb as his own is defective. 
It is a veritable union of souls that we are by 
gradual but inevitable steps led to contemplate, 
and in that view we forget all the rest. Sir 
Richard's life history, as here set before us by Mrs. 
Harrison's admirable art, is interesting through- 
out all its stages. He is a winsome child, and 
becomes most pathetically winsome when the sense 
of his difference from other children first obtrudes 
upon his consciousness. He has all that wealth 
can procure, and in addition all the satisfaction 
that can be bestowed by social position and dis- 
tinguished lineage. But these fortunate circum- 
stances serve only to bring into greater relief the 
contrast between his physical disability and the 
mode of life which his birth offers. The mockery 
of it all becomes poignantly real to him as he grows 
to manhood, and finds that nearly all the joys of 
living, in the physical sense, are denied him. 
Although naturally generous of nature, and of fine 
spiritual endowment, he becomes morbid and cyn- 
ical, and for a term of black years gives free rein 
to the baser elements of our common nature. How 
he is saved from these depths of self-degradation, 
and finally reconciled with such life as is possible 
for him, is the theme of the closing chapters, which 
are strongly moving in their power and beauty. 
One scene in particular is memorable. It is in the 
theatre at Naples ; Sir Richard has just touched 
the nadir of his spiritual abasement, and fate brings 
upon him the crowning humiliation of physical 
insult. His brain is reeling with imminent fever, 
and his mental condition, as he sits in his box, is 
portrayed with absolute psychological mastery. 
This is the turning-point in his career, and when 
he rallies from the disease it is to grope slowly and 
with faltering steps upward into the light of a 
cleansed existence, and a renewed belief in life. 
It has been a hard struggle, but egoism is finally 
merged into altruism, and with the transformation

the world becomes once more a fit place to inhabit, 
even for such a creature as he is. Mrs. Harrison 
does not gloss over the unpleasant aspects of his 
life, and her descriptions are often unconventional 
to the point of daring. But we cannot think her 
work open to condemnation for this lack of reti- 
cence, since its moral purpose is clearly held in 
view, and worked out with a firm hand. Two 
criticisms seem to us fair. One of them is that her 
hero too continually broods over his misfortune, too 
continually tortures himself and others by speaking 
of it. Terrible as such an a£Oliction must be, it 
would in time find its way into the background of 
consciousness ; it is the wont of nature to provide 
some sort of workable adjustment even in so des- 
perate a case as this. The other criticism is directed 
to the machinery of the story. The introduction 
of the chap-book jingle, with its prophecy of Sir 
Richard's birth and fortunes, is a melodramatic 
feature quite unworthy of the art that has given us 
this sustained and impressive creation of character. 
Popularity may safely be predicted for " The 
Benefactress," by the author of " Elizabeth and 
Her German Garden." Considered as a story, it 
. is no great affair, but it makes up for the lack of 
plot-interest by its acute characterizations of per- 
sons and places, and by its shrewd humor. The 
heroine is a young English girl whose home sur- 
roundings are rather vulgar, and who escapes from 
her depressing English environment through the 
happy chance of a country estate in Germany to 
which she falls heiress. She visits the property 
with no further intention than that of inspection, 
but when on the spot, a fine philanthropic notion 
gets into her unsophisticated head, and she deter- 
mines to convert her new property into a home for 
forlorn females with whom the world has dealt 
harshly, herself living with them as a sort of guardian 
angel. There are to be twelve of the chosen, and 
they are to be secured by judicious advertising, and 
careful sifting of the applications. When three 
inmates of the home have thus been secured, the 
plan is put in full operation, but proves a distressing 
failure. The atmosphere of love and sympathy 
which the heroine seeks to create for her charges 
somehow fails to develope, and she is made to suffer 
for a too confiding faith in human nature. Instead 
of fitting into the scheme of things prepared for 
them, the women display about every form of 
meanness and hypocrisy and backbiting. Things 
are all at sixes and sevens, and the benefactress, 
having learned her lesson, does not know how to 
escape from her unpleasant predicament. Fortu- 
nately, a neighboring nobleman provides a way of 
escape upon the usual terms. What becomes of 
the philanthropic idea after their marriage is not 
related, but we may imagine the outcome. Events 
are huddled far too closely together near the end of 
the story to be satisfactory, but the author has had 
her fling, and that is, after all, the main purpose of 
her book. Knowing German life as intimately as 
she does, her book is charmingly revealing, but we 



may say fairly that the disagreeable types of char- 
acter upon which the author's talents are exercised 
seem to have been selected with a malicious sort of 
delight, and that they are not suflBciently relieved 
by characters of more attractive endowment. The 
book is one to make its German readers wince, and 
even to make its English readers feel that the so- 
ciety which it depicts is caricatured rather than 
portrayed. 

" The Secret Orchard " is the work of Mr. and 
Mrs. Egerton Castle, which is equivalent to saying 
that it is artfully contrived and full of romantic 
charm. Bat it is a rather poor example of the 
usually exquisite craftsmanship of these writers, 
and will add nothing to their reputation. The 
trusting wife, the libertine husband, and the young 
woman who makes the mischief, are all familiar 
enough to the novel-reader, and with these three 
the story is almost wholly concerned. It is saved 
from being commonplace by ingenuity of incident, 
animation of manner, and a diction which has the 
touch of delicacy. The *' secret orchard " is simply 
a figurative designation of the unhallowed scenes 
in which unlicensed love accomplishes the wreck 
of faith and happiness. 

In "The Traitor's Way," Mr. S. Levett-Yeats 
tells a story of the French court and the French 
wars during the brief reign of Francis II. It is a 
vigorous narrative, replete with dramatic situations, 
but not very successful in sketching the historical 
background of the action. The hero (who tells the 
story) assures us at the outset that he is a traitor 
of the blackest dye, and his performance makes the 
assurance good. A book which has a despicable 
hero is always handicapped, and the hero in the 
present instance makes matters worse by the pos- 
session of a sort of conscience that compels him to 
insist upon his own villainy upon every possible 
^occasion. We are bound to take him at his word, 
and the result is rather unpleasant. 

" A woman is something fugitive, irrational, in- 
determinate, illogical, and contradictory." These 
words from Amiel are given us as the introduction 
to Mrs. Peattie's story of " The Beleaguered For- 
est," and to their concrete illustration the book is 
devoted. It is a story that must be wronged by 
any retelling, for it deals with temperament rather 
than action, and the character of the woman who 
is its central figure is delineated by an infinity of 
delicate touches, not by a few bold strokes. That 
an impulsive girl should link her fortunes with those 
of a morose man of middle age, already half- 
paretic through addiction to an insidious drug, and 
go off to live with him in his lumber-camp in the 
northern wilderness — this is the least part of the 
story, and yet it is about all there is to tell. What 
chiefly concerns the reader is the development of 
her character under these conditions, and it is with 
keen interest that we follow the process by which 
a strong-souled woman is shaped to take the place 
of an erratic and irresponsible maiden. When the 
term of her self-discipline is ended by the fortunate

death of her husband, and she returns to civilization 
with the closing chapter, we feel the satisfaction of 
having witnessed a deeply interesting experiment 
in kinetic psychology. Mrs. Peattie's book has 
many good qualities. Although it has chiefly to 
do with a morbid theme, it is rather bright than 
gloomy, rather high-spirited than dejected. It is 
also amazingly clever in its turn of phrase, so clever, 
indeed, that it moves in a sort of artificial world of 
its own, in which people are invariably witty or 
epigrammatic when they converse, and preternat- 
urally subtle when they fall into the mood of re- 
flection. 

The vernacular of the logging-camp, which plays 
a necessary part in Mrs. Peattie's novel, reappears 
in the next book on our list, " The Strength of the 
Hills," by Miss Florence Wilkinson. Here the 
scene is not Michigan, but the Adirondacks, and 
with this common feature the resemblance ends. 
Miss Wilkinson's book is the ninth in the " Amer- 
ican Novel Series " of which we have spoken on 
several earlier occasions, and the second volume of 
the series to bear a woman's name. It is a much 
better book than the author's earlier novel, although 
certain trivialities of incident weaken it not a little. 
The hero is a semi-educated rustic, a lumberman 
by vocation, and by avocation an itinerant lay 
preacher of the Methodist persuasion. He is rugged 
and sincere, but not exactly loveable. The novel 
gets its title from his character, and his personality 
dominates the action throughout. But the book is 
not all sombre, and many animated scenes relieve 
the gloom which the hero generally contrives to 
bring with him. In fact, we are rather glad when 
he is in the background, although his character af- 
fords the raison d'etre of the writer's scheme. His 
sister Sararose, wayward and charming, is always 
a welcome presence, and the serious young woman 
who understands and almost loves him wins a high 
place in our esteem. Also, and perhaps above all 
the rest of its good qualities, the book is filled with 
the spirit of the woods and the mountains, and 
effectively preaches the Wordsworthian gospel upon 
every possible occasion. 

The tenth in this same " American Novels Series " 
is by Mr. Basil King, and its scriptural name is 
" Let Not Man Put Asunder." We surmise the 
divorce problem from the mere sight of the title- 
page, but this hardly prepares us for the number 
of unhappy marital combinations that appeal to us 
for sympathy and judgment. To begin with, the 
hero and heroine are married and divorced, to be 
reunited at the very end. Meanwhile, the heroine 
has married another man, himself having a divorced 
wife living at the time. When the latter dies, he 
takes it so much to heart that he shoots himself, 
thus leaving the way clear for his second wife to 
return to her first husband. Meanwhile, the hero's 
sister has got a divorce from her English husband, 
and the latter straightway marries another Amer- 
ican girl, herself the child of parents divorced 
early, and remarried late in life. Here is a coil 



indeed. The purpose of it all seems to be the in- 
culcation of Mr. Punch's "don't," as applied to 
divorce instead of marriage. The sermon is not 
very effective, for the social difficulties of a divorced 
person seem to provide the chief arguments against 
the practice. The story has little action, and is 
characterized by a certain hard brilliancy. The 
occasional attempts to be either pathetic or tragic 
are made perfectly futile by the artificial nature of 
both theme and treatment. 

It is natural to expect steady progress in the 
work of a young novelist of Mr. Robert Herrick's 
parts, and we think, on the whole, that " The Real 
World " indicates a real advance in his grasp upon 
life. A haunting sense that the shows of existence 
are not its reality has obsessed the minds of many 
poets and seers, from Plato to Shakespeare, from 
Omar to Kant; — as Carlyle somewhere says : " All 
deep souls see that." But the mind that has once 
detected the illusion does not rest content ; it strives 
to construct the elements of a new world that shall 
have the stamp of reality. To it then comes the 
behest of the spirit chorus in " Faust ": 

"Prach tiger 
Baue sie wieder. 
In deinem Busen baue sie auf ! " 

That way, no doubt, lies mysticism, but that way 
also lies the possibility of reshaping life in accord- 
ance with eternal truth and the divine purpose. 
This may seem a solemn exordium for our brief 
discussion of Mr. Herrick's new novel, but the work 
of this writer has a quality that suggests large ideas 
and philosophical problems. In form, the novel is 
essentially a biography of its hero during the years 
that bring him to full manhood. We believe that 
" Jock o' Dreams " was first thought of for a title, 
which would have had the advantage of indicating 
more clearly the personal character of the work. 
The hero is a youth who from his earliest years 
lives a life apart from its dull and vulgar environ- 
ment, a youth beset by fancies, who slowly struggles 
upward to the light of self-consciousness and the 
knowledge of good and evil. He finds his real 
world in the moment of victory over temptation 
and the triumph of will over sensual impulse. The 
central passage of the book is so fine that we must 
quote it. " Out of the shadows of things, out of 
the broken ideals, the wooden dummies with which 
he had labored so many years, a world seemed to 
be born, a new world that was true to the touch, 
where he could live and work untormented by 
shadows. He felt the eternal conviction of will, 
undebatable and undemonstrable — the will that 
shapes and makes ; the will that creates the real 
from the unreal ; the will that out of pain and labor 
gives peace ! " The real world is the world in 
which such abstractions as truth and justice and 
righteous living are seen to be the only things that 
are truly concrete, and each of us may, by a resolute 
exercise of the will, recreate this world for himself. 
There is a quite different sort of realism also to be 
found in Mr. Herrick's novel — the sort of literary 



20 



THE DIAL. 



[Jan. 1, 



realism of which Mr. Howells is the typical ex- 
emplar. Some of the earlier chapters might almost 
be taken for the work of Mr. Howells, were it not 
for their lack of gentle humor and genial philos- 
ophy. Mr. Herrick's philosophy is austere rather 
than genial, and a somewhat deadly seriousness 
takes the place of humor. This we take to be a 
defect, as well as the fact that it is rare for one of 
his characters to impress us as a person of strong 
vitality. In a word, Mr. Herrick's work thus far 
seems to us over-intellectualized — a good fault, 
considering what most novelists expect us to put up 
with, yet none the less a fault of balance and of 
sympathy. 

The unexplored regions about the poles constitute 
about the only part of the earth's surface that may 
now be exploited by romancers who wish to be ab- 
solutely untrammeled by actual fact. Central 
Australia, the Gobi desert, and the land of King 
Solomon's mines might properly be put to such use 
a few years ago, but exploration has now left little 
to discover anywhere short of the polar circles. 
Both of the poles have recently been chosen for the 
purposes of romantic fiction, the North Pole by Mr. 
Robert Ames Bennet, and the South Pole by Mr. 
Albert Bigelow Paine. Mr. Bennet's book is called 
" Thyra, a Romance of the Polar Pit." The hero 
gets there in a balloon, and finds a race of hardy 
Norsemen, the descendants of a daring viking leader 
who, a thousand years ago, found his way through 
the icy barrier of the North. By a strange chance, 
a fragment of the Gospels, translated into Old 
Norse, also found its way to the pole, and so we 
are confronted with the strange spectacle of a com- 
munity, essentially heathen in tradition, yet having 
a polity based upon the Sermon on the Mount. 
The adventures of the hero and his companions are 
very surprising indeed. There is a love story, of 
course, with Thyra for its polar heroine. The 
narrative has no style worth speaking of. 

Mr. Paine's " Great White Way," which is " a 
tale of the deepest South," also has little to boast 
of in the way of literary art, but it presents a fairly 
thrilling series of happenings. For the Antarctic 
region also proves to be inhabited by a strange 
isolated people, to which the explorers find their 
way by means of yacht and balloon. This folk is 
characterized by the power of thought-transference, 
which obviates the grosser necessity of speech. 
(We recall a use of the same idea in an Antarctic 
romance published about twelve years ago.) The 
greater part of the story is occupied with the process 
of reaching the pole, and this is really the best of 
the book, for the languid race who are discovered 
at the end of the journey are not of exciting in- 
terest. The jocular millionaire who carries out the 
expedition provides the book with an element of 
farce-comedy, but his cheap witticisms grow mo- 
notonous after a time. The love situation, in this 
case, is created within the limits of the exploring 
party, and thus dispenses with an analogue of Mr. 
Bennet's Arctic heroine. 



Mr. Jeremiah Curtin has set out to make the 
American public acquainted with a new Polish 
novelist, Mrs. Eliza Orzeszko, whom he calls " the 
greatest female writer and thinker in the Slav 
world at present." This claim is a safe one, as far 
as the average reader is concerned, who is probably 
unacquainted with the work of any other woman 
writer of Russia, Poland, or Bohemia. Without 
venturing to subscribe to Mr. Curtin's comparative 
dictum, we may at least say that " The Argonauts," 
which he has chosen out of some forty volumes to 
represent the work of this accomplished woman, is 
a novel well worth reading, and unexpectedly strong 
in its portrayal of character. The Argonauts are 
the seekers for the golden fleece, and in our modern 
world they are called money kings and captains of 
industry. These titles are fairly descriptive of 
Mrs. Orzeszko's Darvid, who is the central figure 
in her work. He is a man of iron will, command- 
ing personality, and an extraordinary genius for 
the solution of business problems. These qualities 
have made him enormously wealthy, but in the 
process of acquiring fortune, he has neglected his 
human duties as husband and father, and in the end 
this neglect recoils upon him, to the undoing of all 
his happiness. His suicide is the strictly logical 
outcome of such an existence; it takes the world 
by surprise, for he is at the height of his success, 
but the reader, who is shown what the world does 
not see, understands what it means to be brought 
face to face with the grim fact that life has been a 
failure in all its highest and holiest obligations. 
" The Argonauts " is a book that strikes no un- 
certain ethical note, and reveals a virile intellectual 
endowment on the part of the writer. 

Another of the stronger women novelists of 
Europe is the Neapolitan Signora Serao, who is 
already fairly well known to our public. A recent 
translation gives us in a single volume the two 
stories, or novelettes, called " The Ballet Dancer " 
and " On Guard." While we have frequently ex- 
pressed admiration for the longer novels of this 
writer, we have felt that they were somewhat over- 
loaded, and that their excessive realism of the Zola 
type was a hindrance to their full effectiveness. 
From these two briefer studies we get a finer sense 
of the writer's powers, and a far greater artistic 
satisfaction than we got, for example, from " The 
Land of Cockayne." There is little here that is 
superfluous ; the presentation is vivid, the psychol- 
ogy bears the stamp of truth, and the pathos is 
made the more moving from the very restraint 
used in its exhibition. 

Two Russian novelists of force and originality 
have just been introduced to the English public. 
Mr. Dmitri M^rejkowski is the author of an am- 
bitious trilogy in which he seeks to portray the 
conflict between Paganism and Christianity, not 
only in the ancient world, when these two gigantic 
forces literally clashed, but also in the modern 
world, which still finds the two terms typical of 
conflicting elements in human nature. According

to the author's view, both these elements are legiti- 
mate and sacred, and he seems to foresee, as a 
sequel to our present civilization, which treats Pa- 
ganism and Christianity as opposing influences, a 
future civilization which shall reconcile the two in 
a single harmonious synthesis. The first section 
of this trilogy is called " The Death of the Gods," 
and has for its subject the career of the Etfiperor 
Julian. One can hardly miss the essential similarity 
between Mr. M^rejkowski's romantic treatment of 
the great Apostate and the dramatic treatment 
given it by Dr. Ibsen, in his wonderful *' Emperor 
and Galilaean." In both cases, there is the same 
broad sympathy with the ideals of the hero, the 
same recognition of the hopelessness of his effort, 
and the same prophetic vision of a time when the 
old opposition shall no longer divide men from men, 
and even array the soul of the individual against 
itself. Certainly, Dr. Ibsen's vision of the " third 
kingdom " is at one with the vision of the author 
of this romance. We shall await with much in- 
terest the two remaining works, in which Leonardo 
da Vinci and Peter the Great are to be the central 
figures. Meanwhile, we may say of the present 
work that it is extraordinarily brilliant in its col- 
oring, and successfully combines a truly vital in- 
terest with the truthfulness of scholarship. 

The career of " Maxim Gorky," whose real name 
is Alexei Maximovitch Pyeshkoff, has been varied 
and picturesque. Apprenticed to one trade after 
another, he soon tired of them all, finding a vagrant 
life much more to his taste. He became a cook's 
boy on a Volga steamer, a laborer in a bakery, an 
apple-peddler, a dock hand, a porter, and a railway 
watchman. He has thus seen much of life in its 
humble aspects and on its seamy side, for his career 
also includes several terms of imprisonment. He 
was an enthusiastic reader of all sorts of books from 
childhood, and began his literary career by writing 
sketches and stories for the newspapers. Recog- 
nition was promptly accorded to his literary work, 
and now, at the age of thirty-two, he has become 
one of the most famous of living Russian writers. 
His "Foma Gordy^eff," now translated by Miss 
Hapgood, is a very disagreeable book, yet a book 
that holds the attention by its extraordinary power 
of vivid portraiture, both of the minds and the 
bodies of its characters. We get very near to 
primitive man in these pages, where the brutish in- 
stincts of mere animalism find full play. This is 
relieved by an occasional touch of poetry or of 
mystical exaltation, but the sum total of the im- 
pression is not far from disgusting. 

In " Orloff and his Wife," which is a collection of 
Maxim Gorky's short stories (" Tales of the Bare- 
foot Brigade "), we have evidence of the author's 
versatility, although the types with which he is wont 
to deal are generally taken from the lower ranks 
of life. One exception is offered by the story of 
" Varenka Olesoff," which is concerned with char- 
acters of education and breeding. It is the only 
story in the collection that we have read with gen- 



uine satisfaction, or that proclaims its writer in 
some sense the compatriot of Tourgudnieff. Most 
of these pieces, in fact, are not stories at all, but 
realistic sketches of life, portrayals of mood, and 
psychological revelations. 

Herr Drachmann's " Nanna," published in the 
popular series of " Tales from Foreign Lands," is 
a translation of the book called " A Paul and Vir- 
ginia of a Northern Zoae." It is one of the earlier 
and slighter works of the versatile Danish novelist 
and poet, but is nevertheless a charming idyl of 
sea-coast life. As the only one of Herr Drach- 
mann's books thus far turned into our language it 
deserves a cordial welcome, and all the more so 
because of the exceptional grace and finish of the 
English in which it is reproduced.

A Borgia 
defense. 



There was a time when it seemed 
the tendency of historical investiga- 
tion to belittle the heroes of a past 
generation. Either we are having the inevitable 
reaction, or the modern demand for novelty has 
caused the discovery of a more productive field in 
the glossing of characters reputedly debased. What- 
ever the cause, the student of to-day apparently 
delights in ferreting out undreamed-of virtues and 
various condoning attainments in the bad men of 
history. Mr. Frederick Baron Corvo has capped 
the climax in his " Chronicles of the House of Bor- 
gia" (Dutton). The author has unquestionably 
delved deep into the literature, and in particular 
into the church literature, of the Borgian period, 
and presents his gleanings in a fashion so uncon- 
ventional as to add greatly to whatever interest 
may be felt in the subject itself. Moreover, the 
reader who has the courage to accustom himself to 
the author's amusing yet distracting use of capitals 
and full titles, will find in the English employed 
sufficient entertainment for the time spent in pe- 
rusal. Either Mr. Corvo is a great master of the 
English language and disdains to use common 
words, or he is a distinguished example of the dic- 
tionary-taught foreigner. His method of treatment 
is as unique as is the language employed ; pro- 
fessedly scorning a systematic arrangement of ma- 
terial, he skips from one topic to another with a 
suddenness that perplexes, yet attracts by its very 
freedom from restraint. It becomes an interesting 
study to guess where he is likely to touch next. As 
for the subject-matter of the book, the defense of 
the Borgias becomes an exceedingly easy task by 
the methods used. Mr. Corvo first postulates the 
immorality of the times, and so excuses his heroes 
as simply representatives of their period. This suf- 
fices for the undeniable looseness of life displayed by 
Csesar Borgia, and by Alexander VI. before he was 
elevated to the Papacy. The historic crimes attrib-

uted to these personages the author denies alto- 
gether, basing his arguments on the non-credibility 
of the written accounts upon which historians have 
depended. These are not credible, he states, be- 
cause produced either by confessed enemies of the 
Borgias, or by mere writers of the tittle-tattle gossip 
of the age ; and in either one of these categories all 
written documents on the subject are placed. The 
treatment throughout is that of an argumentative 
partizan. Hence, the book is not scholarly, and is 
not convincing; but it is interesting, and as a beau- 
tiful example of the printer's art it will attract in- 
stant attention. 

*' Ex Africa semper aliquid novi," 
Lights,newandoid, quotes Mr. Maurice Fitzgibbon in 

on SoiUh Africa. ... , . -rV . . 

his " Arts under Arms, an University 
Man in Khaki" (Longmans); but there is little 
new to be expected of a book that is largely given 
up to "explaining" why the Thirteenth Battalion 
of Imperial Yeomanry was captured by Christian 
de Wet recently. This note of explanations that 
do not explain has been dominant in the news from 
the dark continent from the beginning of the war, 
and it seems to be still in fashion. Mr. Fitzgibbon 
had an appointment in Dublin University when the 
call came for Imperial Yeomanry. Under the 
terms of enlistment, he furnished his own horse and 
most of his equipment, and was to be paid a few 
pence a week. Then he went forth to do or die. 
De Wet saved him the alternative. Having medical 
knowledge, he was placed in charge of the health 
of a number of his fellow-prisoners, who had broken 
down on the march to Pretoria from Lindley in 
the Orange Free State. He remained at Reitz, as 
chief of the temporary hospital there, until Ian 
Hamilton's column released him. His experiences 
were not unpleasant — apart from the humiliating 
fact of his capture ; and he returned to Ireland, 
after seven months of military life, with his desire 
for gore quite abated. The book is as cheerfully 
written as could be expected, and will be useful to 
some future apologist for England. — Far more 
novel is the fact elucidated in " South Africa a 
Century Ago " (Dodd, Mead & Co.) that the Lady 
Anne Lindsay, who wrote that delightful ballad of 
" Auld Robin Gray," was married to Andrew 
Barnard, and that he was appointed the first secre- 
tary of the Cape Colony, by Lord Melville, through 
his wife's influence. Lady Anne kept up a brisk 
correspondence with her old friend. Lord Melville, 
during her stay at the Cape, from July, 1797, to 
February, 1801 ; and these letters are used to make 
the present volume, with an introductory memoir 
by Mr. W. H. Wilkins, M.A., F.S.A. The letters 
are charming, so far as their style is concerned : 
the sprightly correspondence of a witty woman of 
the world. From them it may be deduced that 
Great Britain lost no time in beginning the series 
of errors which still characterize her South African 
policy. The Dutch were antagonized, their prej- 
udices ignored, themselves made the objects of 



British contempt, and an open disregard was shown 
of anything like a desire for a permanent alliance of 
interests between the two nationalities. The letters 
are valuable as describing in some detail the sowing 
of the crop of dragon's teeth which Mr. Fitzgibbon 
of the Imperial Yeomanry assisted in reaping. 

Mr. Augustine Birrell, Queen's Coun- 
frZ^m^m^M! «®^ *"^ Member of Parliament, has 

a clientage and constituency far be- 
yond legal and political limits ; by the members of 
which his reports are received and approved, and 
though "laid on the table," are taken from it again 
and again. His estimates of books and men fairly 
deserve their vogue; their frank personal note is 
not touched with conceit, and they help intelligent 
readers to an intelligent interest and some measure 
of knowledge of the subjects treated. Ten of his 
recent " Essays and Addresses " have been gath- 
ered into a neat little volume (Scribner), uniform 
with his "Obiter Dicta" and "Res Judicatae"; and 
those who enjoy Mr. Birrell's felicitous style and 
shrewd though good-natured satire will welcome this 
addition to the list of his books. Six of the articles 
(those on Wesley, Froude, Taste in Books, the 
House of Commons, the Reformation, and Sir Rob- 
ert Peel) have already appeared in various period- 
icals; the other four (on the Christian Evidences, 
the Ideal University, Walter Bagehot, and Robert 
Browning) are now published for the first time. 
The fact that some of these were addresses deliv- 
ered on "occasions" may account for their slight- 
ness of structure and lightness of treatment (e. g., 
the address on the Ideal University); the same fact 
does not prevent the paper on Walter Bagehot from 
being a sympathetic and even profound study of 
one of the most remarkable writers and thinkers of 
the nineteenth century. Of the Christian Evidences, 
Mr. Birrell writes with alertness though not with 
flippancy, tracing the history of religious polemics 
in England, and noting one great change in " the 
growing disposition to approach the central dogmas 
of Christianity by the avenues of Ritual. . . . At- 
mosphere is a great word just now. To deny the 
existence of atmosphere in the realm of thought is, 
in my opinion, proof of blunted susceptibilities." 
And Mr. Birrell concludes that "We seem to be 
approaching a time in England when sceptics and 
divines may shake limp hands. The divine need 
no longer assert that he can compel belief or prove 
anything, except, experimentally, upon the sad 
heart of man ; whilst the sceptic may as well at 
once admit that he has disproved nothing."

In spite of much magazine literature 
in which the Indian and the army

tically a terra incognita to the American public.

a pathfinder through these wastes who does not pin 
Nature to a board and chart her beauties with 
square and compasses, but portrays her glory, her 
grandeur, and her mystery with an artist's appre- 
ciation of color and form and with a Nature-lover's 
enthusiasm for this somewhat novel and unusual 
part of the out-of-door world. His book, " The 
Desert" (Scribner), is not a work of travel, nor is 
it an artist's diary of two years' enforced sojourn 
in the desert. It is better described by the sub- 
title, " Studies in Natural Appearances," and is a 
very comprehensive discussion of the arid world in 
all its aspects, though never technical and always 
full of life and interest. First impressions of the 
desert landscape, the make of the desert, the in- 
cessant strife, of contending forces and the inevitable 
triumph of silence and desolation, are all portrayed 
with skill and power. The mirage, the desert sky 
and clouds, and the wonderful color effects, are 
described and critically analyzed from the artist's 
point of view, while the scientific explanation of 
the phenomena is given in untechnical language. 
The writer is also a naturalist of very keen powers 
of observation. The struggle for life is here at its 
keenest; sharp and thorny, lean and gaunt, swift 
and fierce, are the favorite adjectives. The Painted 
Desert, the Grand Canyon, the mesas and foothills 
of Southern Arizona, and the mountain barriers of 
California, are described with equal charm. No 
less pleasing are the occasional glimpses of the 
author's personality which the reader catches from 
time to time in his soliloquies on art and nature, 
on life and destiny. The book will be a revelation 
to all who have seen Arizona and Sonora, as well 
as to many who have not seen them ; and it should 
be in the travelling-bag of every transcontinental 
tourist by Central and Southwestern routes. 

The volume on " Woman in the 
GoZZ'ZS: Golden Ages " (Century Co.), which 

the author, Mrs. Amelia Gere Ma- 
son, says has come as a " labor of love " from her 
pen, is one more witness to the beautiful workman- 
ship which love inspires. It is larger in scope than 
her volume on " Women of the French Salons," 
but, like the earlier work, is scholarly enough to 
be authoritative without being compendious enough 
to be dull. How hard it must have been for a 
modern woman to write of Sappho and the First 
Woman's Club, and frankly to admit that the secre- 
tary of that club did not engrave her minutes on 
stone for the benefit of her nineteenth-century 
sisters ! Or to enter in imagination the First Salon, 
held by Aspasia in the house of Pericles, and not 
add to her page a fanciful line which might be mis- 
taken for history ! Yet Mrs. Mason has done all 
this. She says unmistakably, " So much we know ; 
the rest we can only guess." To this wisdom of 
keeping her historical conscience clear, she has 
added that of choosing a sensible point of view. 
She discusses the women of the early and the later 
ages of Greece and Rome, of the early Church, and 



of the Renaissance, not in their relation to any 
narrow phase of the " woman question," but as all- 
around beings who have husbands, children, homes, 
and social graces, as well as political possibilities. 
How true a perspective she gains by such a treat- 
ment, is made evident by her closing chapter on the 
present day Woman's Club. A more just and 
wholesome estimate than this of the gains and losses 
of the modern woman, it would be difficult to find. 
But with all her scholarliness and wisdom, the 
author does not forget that " it is necessary also to 
please." Her writing is never heavy, and her wit 
is often deliciously caustic. Her sense of selection 
is unerring, and saves her work from being crowded 
and encyclopaedic. The club woman who has a 
paper to write may think the chapters discursive, 
and the historic thread of " this from that " too 
slightly traced. But he who reads for enjoyment 
will find ample amends in the delicately appreciative 
pictures of the women of the past, and the pungent 
comments on the times in which they lived. 



Music : 
Us nature 
and Us masters. 



In '' Music and Its Masters " (Lip- 
pincott), Mr. 0. B. Boise, a musician 
of international reputation, has en- 
deavored, through showing the true nature of music 
and the conditions that are essential to its growth 
in breadth and significance, to incite amateurs to a 
more respectful consideration of its claims. All 
real students are familiar with the history of music, 
from the first pan-pipe to the elaborate perfection 
of the modern orchestra; so that this portion of 
his work, together with his treatise on the origin 
of music and the character of its action on intellect 
and emotion — favorite themes with aesthetic phil- 
osophers, — are superfluous. His discussions on 
musical compositions, from Polestuna to the present 
day, are more a propos ; and in his critical analysis 
of the works of the great musicians he is particu- 
larly successful in showing the special intention 
of each master, the individuality, and, where pos- 
sible, the underlying purpose of his art. It is not 
hard to discern that the author is a keen Wag- 
nerian, and consequently holds a high opinion of 
Brahms and Tchaikovsky. The earnest study of 
any branch of learning broadens the perceptions ; 
and when Mr. Boise formulates his reasons, tersely 
and precisely, for naming Bach, Beethoven, Schu- 
mann, Schubert, Mendelssohn, and Wagner, as the 
epoch-making musicians, we realize the true value 
of his critical ability. The book is pervaded by 
an enthusiasm which gives a peculiar zest to its 
critical portions ; it is not technical in the ordinary 
acceptation of the term, although the mention of 
certain fundamental principles was necessary in 
forming a basis for the author's sesthetic theories.

cheerful and seemly details. " Colonial Fights and 
Fighters " (McClure, Phillips & Co.) is his latest 
contribution to the literature of gore, — the successor 
in publication, though the predecessor in historical 
time, of his " American Fights and Fighters." 
His point of view is admirably set forth in the ad- 
jectives with which he decorates his dramatis per- 
soncB, thus : " The proud, cruel, domineering, in- 
domitable Spaniard "; " the gay, debonair, dashing, 
brilliant Frenchman "; " the merciless, rapacious, 
lustful, yet courageous Buccaneer "; " the base, 
brutal, bloodthirsty Pirate "; " the plumed and 
painted Savage with his fearful war-cry, his stoic 
endurance, his subtle strategy"; "the cool, stub- 
born, persistent, persevering, heroic Englishman "; 
and " the hardy Colonist, adding to his old-world 
stock the virtues generated by the new life in a new 
land." These phrases seem to indicate a certain 
lack of the humorous sense in the reverend author : 
what a re-arrangement of epithets there would be, 
for example, if the painted Savage were permitted 
to put in print his impressions of the heroic En- 
glishman and the hardy Colonist ! Unquestionably 
the book is interesting — just as the apples were to 
our first parents in the Garden. So was its com- 
panion volume on " American Fights and Fighters," 
and so will be the volume newly announced on 
" Pioneer Fights and Fighters." But there will be 
the feeling in certain quarters that the books will 
be read, not for the excellence of the cause for 
which the fighting was done, — for there seems to 
have been just as many fighting against the cause 
as for it, — but for the fighting itself ; and if this 
is what Christianity is coming to mean in the 
twentieth century, the lees we have of it from the 
clergy the better. Quis custodiet cicstodies ? "Who

Syria and There was no portion of the ancient 

Palestine in Eastern world that was so often 

early Umes. overrun by invading armies as the 

eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea. Its loca- 
tion between the great powers of Asia and Egypt 
made it of peculiar importance. Professor L. B. 
Paton's " Early History of Syria and Palestine " 
(Scribner) is a collection and presentation of the 
main facts found in the literatures of ancient oriental 
peoples touching this small section of country. The 
whole stretch of time covered extends from the 
earliest traditions and records of the population of 
those lands down to the fall of Babylon in 538 B. C. 
This period is broken into thirteen chapters. Some 
of those preceding the settlement of the Hebrews 
in Palestine are " The Earliest Inhabitants," " The 
Old Babylonian Supremacy," " The Amoritic Mi- 
gration," "The Rule of the City of Babylon," 
" The Canaanitic Migration," " The Egyptian Su- 
premacy," and "The Rise of the Aramaean Nations." 
In the treatment of each of these chapters, the 
author has either consulted the sources themselves, 
or specialists who deal directly with the ancient 
records. His scrupulous care in dealing with the 



actually recorded facts of those records is every- 
where in evidence, unless we should except his 
method of dealing with the records of the earlier 
books of the Old Testament. Theories seem largely 
to have dominated much that he has to say on the 
statements recorded in the Hexateuch. But the 
book does a valuable service in collecting and 
arranging material otherwise found only in scores 
of works. The Bibliography of the subject and 
the chronological tables are especially serviceable 
for students who are entering upon the study of 
those early times. Index and maps also add no 
small part to the completeness of this volume — a 
useful handbook for every student of the ancient 
Oriental world. 

When Mr. H. G. Hutchinson in his 
The borders ^^^.^ ^^ » Dreams and their Mean-

ings (Longmans) tells the reader 
that he introduced a sketch of what science has to 
say about dreams so as to " bring the reader up 
(or down) to that equal state of ignorance with the 
writer," he disarms all criticism. This is an 
avowedly popular book, is agreeably written, and 
in large measure is a contribution to the anthro- 
pology of dreams. There is, too, an entertaining 
discussion of the dreams that are of most frequent 
occurrence, upon which the author has collected 
quite a fund of material. The dreams of falling, 
of flying, of appearing in society with a shocking 
paucity of garments, of being pursued by a bogey, 
or even of dying and holding a post-mortem exam- 
ination of oneself, — these all occur and are variously 
presented from the answers of correspondents. 
Upon this follow two rather dreary and inconse- 
quential chapters from the material furnished by the 
Society for Psychical Research as to telepathic and 
premonitory dreams. The whole volume thus does 
nothing more than loiter agreeably in the outskirts 
of an interesting region. It is a traveller's account 
of a country, lightly and agreeably presented ; not 
a student's report upon the fauna and flora. Taken 
at its proper standard, it forms as agreeable an in- 
troduction to this aspect of dreamland as may easily 
be found ; but whether it is a good or desirable side 
is another question. For people who like this sort 
of book, this book may be recommended as the sort 
they are likely to enjoy.

as " polite society," — and only with making those

occasions in life which have little or nothing to do 
with polite society as such, and there are other oc- 
casions in which it seems to be necessary to be im- 
polite ; and these Mrs. Kingsland leaves quite alone. 
It was Sidney Smith, if recollection serves aright, 
who remarked that the memory of social obliquities

persisted when that of sins failed ; and in a society 
so plastic as that in America, the need for instruc- 
tion among those who are going up the social 
ladder is doubtless great. For these, such books 
as this are written. Nothing is said, however, 
about such methods of climbing as involve the snub- 
bing of those outstripped in the ascent, or the con- 
ciliation of those above ; nor are any provisions 
made for those who might like to climb down with 
ease, if not with grace. What the book might con- 
tain to advantage is a plain statement that the 
practice of polite manners, as generally understood 
in the United States, requires a certain endowment 
of wealth, — social position of almost any sort being 
based upon expenditure more or less lavish. The 
book has a praiseworthy chapter on manners in the 
older countries, France in particular, from which 
it may be learned that Americans at their politest 
have still a great deal to learn. Generally speaking, 
American etiquette might be discussed under two 
heads : When Does it Pay to be Polite ? and When 
Does it Pay to be Rude ? Mr. Thorstein Veblen 
has cast much light on this alternative problem in 
his admirable " Theory of the Leisure Class." 



Hamilton '^^^ little volume on Alexander Ham- 
at a builder ilton, written by Mr. C. A. Conant 
of the Republic. f^r the "Riverside Biographical 
Series " (Houghton), is only an outline of the great 
career of its subject, but it shows the skill of the 
trained student and writer in its clearness and pro- 
portion. Mr. Conant seems to be of the opinion 
that the form of our government, its successful 
establishment, and its later greatness, are due to 
Hamilton more than to any other man. Wash- 
ington and Jefferson and Marshall are made sec- 
ondary in their direct influence toward these ends. 
This impression may be due to the narrow limits 
of the sketch, and the fault of making its subject 
the centre of influence is partly inherent in histor- 
ical biography ; but the reader who is familiar with 
our history can easily supply the other influences 
that were working with Hamilton's, while the un- 
trained reader will get from the book what he 
needs to fill out the common idea of our early 
national history. 

A brief The history of Oliver Cromwell from 

biography of a biographical point of view is pre- 

Cromweii. ^^^^^^ ^^ Messrs. Longmans, Green, 

& Co. in a new reprint of the earlier work by Mr. 
Samuel Rawson Gardiner. Though revised by the 
author, little change has been made in the subject 
matter. The work has long been regarded as a 
model in condensed biographical writing, and its 
appearance at a moderate price will certainly be wel- 
comed. Mr. Gardiner's Cromwell differs from the 
more modern Cromwell in that greater stress is laid 
upon the earlier and military period of his life, and 
less upon his acts as a ruler of England. Present- 
day criticism attributes to Cromwell a great genius 
in constructive statesmanship. This is not the view 



of Mr. Gardiner ; though the plea is not combatted, 
for it had not arisen at the time the book was writ- 
ten. It is likely indeed that in the recent Crom- 
well revival a greater prescience has been credited 
to him than he was rightly entitled to ; and in this 
respect an acquaintance with Mr. Gardiner's simple, 
honest, and God-fearing hero will well serve to 
restore a just balance. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



For the curious, " The Last Words of Distinguished 
Men and Women " (Revell), compiled by Mr. Frederic 
Rowland Marvin, will have a melancholy interest. The 
names of those whose death- bed reflections are here 
recorded are arranged in alphabetical order, and in 
most cases a few lines, sometimes a page or two, of bio- 
graphical comment are added. The compilation has 
evidently been made with care, and in details of ty- 
pography and printing the book is very satisfactory. A 
wide range of names is covered in the three hundred 
and more pages, and the volume should have some value 
for reference, 

Mr. John Burroughs has compiled for Messrs. 
McClure, Phillips & Co. a selection of " Songs of Na- 
ture " from English and American poetry. The volume 
is a very personal one, being made up wholly of the 
things that the editor likes, rather than of the things 
generally approved. The introduction makes some 
pertinent observations, such as : " The painted, padded, 
and perfumed Nature of many of the younger poets I 
cannot stand at all." " When I find poppies blooming 
in the corn in an American poem, as I several times 
have done, I pass by on the other side." 

A serious hook, but one in which the subject is too 
comprehensively grasped to be devoid of humor, is Mrs. 
Heloise Edwina Hersey's " To Girls : A Budget of 
Letters " (Small, Maynard & Co.). The author's ex- 
tended experience as an educator enables her to speak 
with authority, and this same experience has given her 
that charity which does not fail because strenuous de- 
mands are made upon it. The lighter phases of life 
are touched upon, as well as the great questions of all 
ages — religion, wealth and its uses and abuses, health, 
and a thousand things besides which may be read with 
advantage by the sex to which the letters are not ad- 
dressed as well. There is a notable absence of cant 
throughout the book. 

"The Laurel Song Book," edited by Mr. W. L. 
Tomlins for advanced school work and choral societies, 
is published by Messrs. C. C. Birchard & Co., Boston. 
The collection is noticeable for its large proportion of 
compositions by recent writers, mostly Americans. 
While the aim is laudable enough, while excellent things 
are written by modern composers, and while the taste 
of Mr. Tomlins himself is nearly always true to a high 
mark, yet we cannot but feel that young people should 
be occupied chiefly with songs that have an unquestioned 
place in the history of culture, rather than with recent 
compositions, no matter how meritorious. The songs 
we learn in childhood remain with us for life, and it 
means a great deal to go through life with the immortal 
melodies ringing in our ears. Nothing should be al- 
lowed to divert the teacher of singing from this con- 
ception of his primary obligation.

Notes. 



" Deutsche Sagen," by Miss Franciska Geibler, is an 
elementary reading book in German, based upon le- 
gendary material, and published by Messrs. Longmans, 
Green, & Co. 

A new edition of Dr. George Willis Botsford's 
" History of Greece for High Schools and Academies," 
first published three years ago, is now sent out by the 
Macmillan Co. 

Saint Teresa's " The Way of Perfection " forms the 
second volume in the recently-inaugurated " Cloister 
Library," edited by Mr. A. R. Waller, and published 
under the Dent-Macmillan imprint. 

" A Critical History of Opera," by Mr. Arthur Elson, 
a son of the veteran Boston critic, is a useful little book, 
provided with many portrait and scenic illustrations, 
just published by Messrs. L. C. Page & Co. 

The two-act comedy " Zaragueta," by SeBor Miguel 
Ramos Carridn y Vital Aza, has been edited, with notes 
and vocabulary, by Professor George C. Howland, and 
is published by Messrs. Silver, Burdett & Co. 

The late Dr. Buchheim's school edition of Goethe's 
"Hermann und Dorothea," with an introduction by 
Professor Edward Dowden, has just been published by 
Mr. Henry Frowde for the Oxford Clarendon Press. 

A new volume in the " Temple Classics for Young 
People " (Dent-Macmillan) is a collection of " Stories 
from Le Morte Darthur and the Mabinogion " by Miss 
Beatrice Clay, with a colored frontispiece and other 
illustrations by Mr. C. E. Hughes. 

Messrs. Silver, Burdett & Co. publish " A Graded 
List of Poems and Stories for Use in Schools," prepared 
by Mr. Charles B. Gilbert and Miss Ada Van Stone 
Harris. The classification is by grades, and covers the 
eight years of the ordinary elementary school. 

A new edition in three volumes of " Chambers's Cy- 
clopsedia of English Literature" is now in course of 
publication by the J. B. Lippincott Co. The work has 
been greatly extended, and to a considerable extent re- 
constructed and rewritten. 

The Messrs. Scribner import an edition of "The 
Poems of John Milton," printed on very thin paper, 
and tastefully bound in limp leather. Although the 
type is fairly large, and readily readable, the volume 
is of such dimensions as easily to slip into the pocket. 
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. are the publishers of 
Schiller's " Die Braut von Messina," edited by Professors 
A. H. Palmer and J. G. Eldridge, and of Goethe's 
" Reineke Fuchs " (the first five cantos), edited by 
Mr. L. A. Holman. Kaulbach's illustrations add not a 
little to the attractiveness of the latter volume. 

The issue of " Life " for December 26 constitutes its 
one thousandth number, and pleasantly bespeaks the 
permanence and prosperity of this sprightly publication. 
"Life" is something more than the best of our humor- 
ous weeklies; on its serious side it is as fearless a power 
for truth and right thinking as we have in the periodical 
world to-day. 

The next publication to be issued by Mr. Clarke 
Conwell at the Elston Press will be " The Art and Craft 
of Printing " by William Morris. This work will pre- 
sent, for the first time, a complete record of Morris's 
written and spoken words concerning his views on print- 
ing and his work at the Kelmscott Press. The edition 
is limited to 300 copies. 



Mr. E. F. Harkins is the author of a series of " Little 
Pilgrimages among the Men Who Have Written Fa- 
mous Books." There are a score of sketches, all of 
living American authors, and nearly all accompanied 
by portraits. The writing is agreeably chatty and an- 
ecdotical, and the portraits are excellent. Messrs. 
L. C. Page & Co. are the publishers. 

Several years ago, Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. re- 
printed Mrs. Trollope's famous book on the " Domestic 
Manners of the Americans." The book still seems to 
be in demand, for we now have a new edition, two vol- 
umes in one, with the interesting if libellous original 
illustrations, and Professor H. T. Peck's words of in- 
troduction to the modern reader. 

A quarto volume in the astronomical series of publi- 
cations of the University of Pennsylvania gives no less 
than nine hundred measures of double stars, made by 
Mr. Eric Doolittle with the eighteen-inch refractor of 
the Flower Observatory. The stars measured have 
been selected from Mr. S. W. Burnham's lists, and the 
results have been critically examined by that veteran 
observer. 

The "Outlines of Political Science," by Messrs. 
George Gunton and Hayes Robbins, may be used as a 
text-book, and will also be found readable by others 
than schoolboys. Professor Gunton's protectionism is 
still in evidence, but time seems to have mellowed its 
vigor, and it now approaches more closely to a rational 
view of the subject. The publishers are Messrs. D. 
Appleton & Co. 

Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons are the publishers of a 
new edition of Prince Peter Kropotkin's " Fields, Fac- 
tories, and Workshops." This extremely interesting 
and valuable work, first published in 1898, deserves to 
be widely read, and the present low-priced edition 
should reach a wide circle of students and other per- 
sons in search of economic facts as distinguished from 
economic fancies. 

" The Faculty Corner " is the title of an unpretentious 
volume which comes to us from Iowa College, and its 
contents consist of various papers contributed by mem- 
bers of the teaching staff to a college publication. They 
include such subjects as " Education according to Na- 
ture," " Notes on the Modern Drama," " The Song 
Spirit among the Greeks," " Some Experiences in Prac- 
tical Politics," " The Bible in Chaucer," and " The Study 
of Society." 

Mr. Elijah Clarence Hills, whose name has a strange 
look upon a title-page where all else is Spanish, has 
edited a volume of selections from the Cuban poets of 
the nineteenth century. These " Bardos Cubanos " are 
seven in number, and their names are Heredia, " Pla- 
cido," Avellaneda, Milanes, Mendive, Luaces,and Lonea. 
Each is represented by a number of examples, and pro- 
vided with a brief sketch of his life. The book is pub- 
lished in Boston, " EE. UU.," by Messrs. D. C. Heath 
&Co. 

For the reader who wishes to take a rapid but intel- 
ligent survey of the French literature of recent years 
we can cordially recommend M. Georges Pellissier's 
"Le Mouvement Littdraire Contemporain " (Paris: 
Plon). This work covers the last quarter of the nine- 
teenth century, and discusses in succession the five lit- 
erary species of fiction, the drama, poetry, criticism, 
and history. It is an admirable book, written from the 
standpoint of the evolutionist critic, sane in its judg- 
ments, and brilliant in their setting-forth. The student

of French literature will find it particularly useful for 
orientation in the regions of recent poetry and the 
drama, which, even more than the others, need just 
such a survey as is given them in this satisfactory study. 

An excellent book for children to read in connection 
with their school texts is the volume of " Stories from 
English History," which has been edited by Mr. Henry 
P. Warren from some unnamed English source, and is 
now published by Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. The 
stories are very brief, very numerous, and very simply 
told. The pictorial features of the book, although of 
a sort frowned upon by severe educational theorists, 
will doubtless be welcome to the childish reader. 

" Bell's Miniature Series of Painters " is the latest 
enterprise of the English art-publishers, Messrs. George 
Bell & Sons (New York : The Macmillan Co.). Mr. 
George C. Williamson is the editor of the series, which 
aims to help the beginner in art to a right understanding 
of the world's greatest painters. In the three volumes 
so far issued Mr. Williamson treats of Velazquez and 
Fra Angelico, and Mr. Malcolm Bell of Burne-Jones. 
The volumes are daintily printed and bound, and pro- 
vided with numerous excellent illustrations. 

Dante's " Purgatorio " is now issued in the " Temple 
Classics " series (Dent-Macmillan), uniform with the 
«' Inferno " and " Paradiso " already published, thus 
completing this admirable edition of the " Commedia." 
The translation, printed on alternate pages with the 
Italian text, is in this case entirely new, and is the work 
of Mr. Thomas Okey, translator of Mazzini's " Essays " 
and joint author (with Mr. Bolton King) of a recently- 
published volume on " Italy To-day." The Arguments 
and other editorial matter are supplied by the Rev. 
Philip H, Wicksteed. 

Mr. Andrew Lang's " Alfred Tennyson " (Dodd) is 
a volume in the " Modern English Writers " series, 
which already comprises an Arnold, a Ruskin, and a 
Stevenson. It is just such a book as we should expect 
from Mr. Lang upon the subject, wise and witty, un- 
expectedly allusive, temperate in its judgments yet 
warmly sympathetic with the genius of the poet. Con- 
sidered as sober criticism, it is a book of fine insight 
and thorough acquaintance with its subject. It is also 
a book that scintillates with epigrams, and reflects light 
from many strange sources. With all its seeming light- 
ness of manner, it really outweighs almost any of the 
graver commentators.

PHASES OF LITERARY CRITICISM. 



It is generally conceded that in the domain 
of literary criticism, America is far behind 
England, France, and Germany. Is this be- 
cause the American people are too busy to 
think ? Is it because, when they have a few 
hours to spare from the mad scramble for 
money, they devote themselves to recreation 
and amusement and let books take care of 
themselves ? Is it because the morning and 
afternoon newspapers supply all their needs in 
the way of reading, with an occasional frothy 
novel snatched up and devoured with no higher 
literary purpose than to find out whether the 
hero and heroine marry in the last chapter ? 

There can be no doubt that the constant 
reading of newspapers spoils the mental appe- 
tite and digestion for thoughtful, masterly 
books. So many people are concerned with 
the present, with the concrete affairs of every- 
day life, that they actually think it a waste of 
time to read anything that will improve their 
minds. Hence the works of learned professors 
and of great authors (I do not mean popular 
authors, though certainly some of the latter are 
great) have a surprisingly limited circulation 
as compared to the whole population of the 
country. And even yet comparatively few 
people make a hobby of books as they do of 
other things. 

If high-class and scholarly books now go 
begging among the masses, it follows that 
critical effort shares in the general apathy. 
There is little inducement for scientific criti- 
cism to assert itself. The output of the pub- 
lishers is too often reviewed by professional 
critics in that perfunctory and hackneyed fash- 
ion which carries less and less weight each 
year with the general reader. Why ? Because 
professional critics are seldom original think- 
ers. Besides, so enormous is the inflow of 
books — largely worthless — that, in order to 
keep their desks and tables half-way cleared, 
newspaper critics often " notice " volumes of 
which they have not even cut the leaves. 

Scientific criticism is not accomplished in or 
for a day, a week, or a month. Criticism of 
a quality worthy the name implies that its pro-

ducer has lived as well as browsed in a library ; 
so that he knows his own capacity not only to 
think, but to love, to feel, to suffer. In other 
words, he must know some of the true mean- 
ings of life from actual experience, and not 
alone from study and hearsay. This require- 
ment, too, makes the great poet, — as well as 
the great man in whatever walk of life. Lit- 
erature and art are in their broadest sense 
expressions of life, of which the creative mind 
interprets some or many phases. Someone has 
defined art as truth filtered through a person- 
ality. But these definitions amount to very 
little. The main thing is to winnow the wheat 
from the tares in literature, and to read only 
such works as have intellectual beauty, moral 
force, and those ineffable inspirations which 
strengthen mind and character. 

Contemporary criticism of the highest qual- 
ity shows a wide divergence from that of fifty 
years ago, in that it is more liberal, more thor- 
ough, more expert. Its standards are higher. 
Arrant trash it usually leaves alone, as not 
worth wasting time over. This was once not 
so. Compare the quibbling, sometimes vicious, 
criticisms of Poe with the calm and philosophic 
utterances of Matthew Arnold. Yet to some 
minds Mr. Arnold was often too academic, too 
nonchalantly sure of classic criteria. 

With most men and women, popular expo- 
sition still wins the greatest favor, — just as in 
creative literature what is simple and universal 
makes the strongest appeal. If there is one 
thing more than another that has vitiated En- 
glish and American criticism within the past 
half century, it has been the tendency to sneer 
without cause, to make light of serious efforts, 
to lug in the morbidly introspective or the 
merely flippant things. Here and there a clear- 
eyed and clear-minded student rises to the 
requirements of the hour and gives us the final 
products of his analysis and ratiocination. Such 
results represent the most conscientious insight 
plus a broad culture and that indispensable 
something which we call style. 

We need more critics, not less ; but we want 
them on the order of John Addington Sy- 
monds, Walter Pater, Professor Saintsbury, 
James Russell Lowell, Edmund Clarence Sted- 
man. Do we need such critics as Taine, whose 
relentless and inadequate logic so repelled, 
dried, corroded, and saddened the delicate yet 
far from effeminate soul of Amiel ? The read- 
ing of Taine, he said, had to him " the smell 
of the laboratory ; it never inspired, but only 
informed, and gave algebra to those who asked 



life, the formula for the image, the heady 
fumes of distillation for the divine intoxication 
of Apollo." As to a portion of Taine's work, 
this seems aptly true. Time and again I have 
tried to read " On Intelligence," and always 
with the same result — a sort of hungry dis- 
appointment. "One must stand as well with 
the public sentiment as with God himself," 
says the Talmud ; and it also says, " To the 
wasp men say. Neither thy honey nor thy 
sting." 

If the critic has something to tell from the 
depths of his own heart, who will not listen ? 
We shall not think of him then as a man who 
has failed as an author and turned blackguard ; 
but as one who understands and respects his 
vocation. It is an admirable thing to be sure 
first of the good points in an author's work, 
to be attuned to the best that is in him. Few 
men are always equal to their best, and per- 
haps if they were they would become monot- 
onous or too strong for human nature's daily 
food. If Homer sometimes nods, if Lowell 
drops occasionally from his higher moods, if 
Stevenson ranges from the most exquisite 
word-carving to childish dalliance, if Mr. Henry 
James frequently strains his diction to its most 
attenuated limits, even if Mr. Howells some- 
times prefers to exalt the commonplace with 
an art fit for the realms of pure Romance, — 
we should remind ourselves that they all were 
or are human. If, in print, we choose to 
differ from them we must be certain that our 
point of view is at least wide enough to stand 
upon with both feet. Sainte-Beuve said of 
Massillon : 

" It is not given to all minds to feel and to relish 
equally the peculiar beauties and excellences of Mas- 
sillon/ To like Massillon, to enjoy him sincerely and 
without weariness, is a quality and almost a peculiarity 
of certain minds, which may define them. He will 
love Massillon who loves what is just and noble better 
than what is new, who prefers elegant simplicity to a 
slightly rough grandeur; who, in the intellectual order, 
is pleased before all things with rich fertility and cult- 
ure, with small sobriety, with ingenious amplification, 
with a certain calmness and a certain repose even in 
motion, and who is never weary of those eternal com- 
monplaces of morality which humanity will never ex- 
haust." 

It is doubtful if Schopenhauer would have 
felt edified by hearing the great French divine ; 
for Schopenhauer had the incredible temerity 
to say that " no change of human nature can 
ever be affected by the spread of moral doc- 
trines." So here again is the point of view, 
which must not be lost sight of for a moment. 

If a man stands aloof in bis own inflexible

egotism to judge the efforts of others, he never 
can be a true critic. He must divest himself 
of personal prejudices and blind habits of ar- 
bitrary taste. If he applies comparisons, they 
must, in all justice, be such as he would will- 
ingly have his own statements weighed by. In 
other words, the critic owes it to his readers 
to put himself in the author's place as much 
as possible. This, to be sure, was not Macau- 
lay's way nor Jeffrey's. Macaulay was a blind 
partisan in his decisions about everything. He 
sometimes demolished " his man," and then 
set him up again as he thought the man should 
have been in the first place. And we derive 
an idea from reading Macaulay that he was 
not so shrewd in his discrimination as his in- 
telligence was colossal. Even when on the 
wrong side of a question he was forcible and 
clear, but these very qualities only made more 
vivid and complete his errors. With true 
British obstinacy, he would argue out an ab- 
surd proposition to the bitter end, sometimes 
as though in sheer desire to turn on a torrent 
of literary and historic allusions. 

The ideals of a by-gone age are not binding 
upon us, except as we wish to have them so. 
We are far removed from much of the pagan 
thought which coexisted with the highest civi- 
lization of the Greeks. They bequeathed much 
that the cultivated race of to-day would not 
willingly lose ; but have we not gained much 
that they never had ? It is the business of 
criticism to keep in touch with the movement 
of evolution and with the spirit of the twentieth 
century. Mr. Leslie Stephen declares that 
" the whole art of criticism consists in learning 
to know the human being who is partially re- 
vealed to us in his spoken or written words." 
This shows that Mr. Stephen is as much inter- 
ested in life as in literature — a good symptom 
in any kind of a connoisseur. To some bookish 
souls literature is life itself, and the men and 
things around them vague shadows. A poetical 
friend of mine often confesses that he lives in 
the moon, and his practical knowledge of every- 
day matters is most amazing or amusing, ac- 
cording as one may regard it. We are a great 
deal better organized socially and intellectually 
than people were in that age which " made no 
sign when Shakespeare, its noblest son, passed 
away." Two sayings of Emerson — "Great- 
ness appeals to the future," and "To be great 
is to be misunderstood," — contain clues to 
the reason why some great authors are not 
always appreciated in their own generation 
and country. 



Censure does not necessarily imply a stand- 
ard. A man may inveigh against something 
without having taste or sensibility to back 
him. Censure is no more the purpose of true 
criticism than is praise. Nearly every fool 
thinks he can write a book, and most fools 
think they can criticise one. The greatest 
skill, however, is not displayed in tearing 
down, but in building up. It is wisely put in 
Max Miiller's epigram : " It is the heart that 
makes the critic, not the nose." And by 
Richter : " Criticism often takes from the tree 
caterpillars and blossoms together." 

Our best thinkers have brought about a 
mental and moral uplift in the ranks of the 
great middle classes of the United States, who 
demand for themselves and for their children 
the best that our men of genius can produce. 
And with such a gigantic incentive as the favor 
of the best portion of the American public, our 
authors are rising magnificently to the occasion, 
and will lift professional criticism too. Some 
of our very best criticism, which the public 
knows nothing about, is performed in the lead- 
ing publishing houses and by the editors of the 
great magazines. The readers and literary 
advisers employed by these publishers are men 
and women of exceptional ability in their field. 
They reject probably 90 per cent of the manu- 
scripts submitted to them, and though they 
thus disappoint many aspirants they maintain 
a certain creditable standard. Many worthless 
manuscripts are published sooner or later, but 
they do not come out with the imprint of any 
high-class firm ; they lack the stamp which 
presupposes at least good workmanship. Again, 
many manuscripts have good material in them, 
but are technically faulty; in which case they 
are sometimes sent back to be revised by the 
author. The same is true of MSS. sent to 
magazine editors. Thus, in many ways, the 
public is spared the pain of reading shoddy or 
slatternly writing in books and publications 
issued by these careful and exacting houses, 
which have won their reputation by these 
methods. Critical acumen and skill enter into 
this routine to an extent undreamed of by the 
average reader. Many expert editors handle 
the " copy " in a large magazine office, and 
errors seldom escape their Argus eyes. Indeed, 
if some books, even by veteran authors, were 
published as written, without pruning or altera- 
tions by a sagacious editor, the critics would 
be neglecting their duty not to condemn them 
with merciless vigor or ridicule them out of 
the market. Leon Mead.

The Truth about China.* 



When the tenth edition of the Encyclopaedia 
Britannica comes to be issued (is not its pre- 
decessor even now growing obsolete on our 
shelves ?) no article will demand more thorough 
re- writing than that which is headed " China." 
That the torpid self-centred existence of ages 
should have been so violently shaken by the 
war of 1894 and the explosions of 1900, and 
should thenceforth reluctantly but inevitably 
form part of the nervous fretwork of the na- 
tions, are among the most significant facts of 
the last turbulent decade. Of the score or 
more of books on China (in English alone) 
brought out since the dramatic scenes at the 
Peking Legations during that memorable sum- 
mer, the majority will have their day and cease 
to be. Made up of impressions received during 
the strain of those trying days, they are good 
material for the historian rather than historical 
writing. Of all countries, China offered the 
least appui to the impromptu interpreter of 
national feeling as voiced in national move- 
ments ; the only safe rule apparently being to 
reverse the application of occidental motives, 
so far as they can be retraced from results. 
To do this with discretion — that is, with a 
knowledge when not to do it — is not vouch- 
safed to war correspondents or the average 
globe-trotter ; nor must it be expected of them. 
We are now pretty well assured that an ade- 
quate account of the recent crisis in China 
could be prepared only with the aid of special 
natural gifts, and after long residence in the 
country, supplemented by a full acquaintance 
with the possibilities — and impossibilities — 
of the Chinese language. 

For these things not many men are sufficient ; 
but probably no living writer more nearly fulfils 
their hard conditions than does Rev. Arthur 
H. Smith, who is already so widely and favor- 
ably known as the author of " Chinese Char- 
acteristics " and " Village Life in China," and 
who now presents us, in two handsome vol- 
umes, the winnowed results of a life of thought 
and observation, under the appropriate title of 
"China in Convulsion." In a certain sense 
the book has been nearly thirty years getting 
itself written. Dr. Smith knows the Chinese 
character better probably than any other living

American. His long residence and study, his 
penetrating eye for detail, his judicial temper, 
his piquant style, and his saving grace of 
humor, make a combination of qualifications 
whose net result, as seen in this book, is the 
most interesting and authoritative document 
in its somewhat crowded class. 

The author recognizes at the outset the dif- 
ficulty of his task, quoting with approval Mr. 
A. R. Colquhoun's somewhat ponderous sen- 
tence, " immense and indefinite duration multi- 
plied by incomputable numbers of population 
must make an aggregate literally incompre- 
hensible." In the first chapter, entitled " Re- 
moter Sources of Antipathy," Chinese seclusion, 
ignorance, and conceit are admirably described 
without being accounted for. The national 
aversion to foreigners, according to Dr. Smith, 
needs no further rationale than the fact that 
the foreigners are not Chinese. But this funda- 
mental reason has been well buttressed during 
the past century by international complications, 
arising mainly from foreign eagerness to press 
trade upon reluctant China ; and by the distrust 
which the introduction of Christianity has 
aroused among the literary classes. 

About this vexed matter of the missionaries 
Dr. Smith speaks with perfect candor. Aside 
from the natural unwillingness of Chinese 
scholars to admit that anything could be added 
to their wisdom, there is the special question 
of ancestral worship, a central tenet of Con- 
fucianism, and the first one to be abandoned 
by Christianized Chinese. Dr. Smith adds : 

" We are not concerned at this time either to defend 
the almost universal judgment of the Christian church 
in China in regard to the worship of ancestors, or to 
inquire by what means some via media may be employed 
to combine reverence to man and worship to God, so 
that neither shall infringe upon the other. Our object 
is simply to make it clear that we recognize the present 
attitude of the Christian church (Protestant and Catholic 
alike) as a great bar to the spread of the Gospel in 
China, and perhaps as the most potent single cause of 
Chinese hostility." 

The anti-foreign riots of the past forty years, 
directed mainly, but not exclusively, against 
missionary stations, are rapidly sketched, be- 
ginning with the attack, in 1868, on the Inland 
Mission at Chen Chiang ; and including the 
Tientsin massacre (1870), the anti-French 
riots at Shanghai (1874), and the various 
outbreaks in " turbulent Canton." The bitter 
hatred which both fomented these attacks and 
was increased by them received, in the last 
quarter of the century, fresh impetus from the 
" commercial intrusion," chiefly of railways,

telegraphs, and mining enterprises ; and from 
the various acts of territorial aggression on the 
part of Russia, Germany, Great Britain, and 
France. 

" Probably there is not another country on the planet 
where events and conditions such as have been very 
imperfectly hinted at would not long before have pro- 
duced an outbreak. ' What the Barbarians want,' said 
a ruler quoted in Mencius, ' is my territory.' The events 
of the past few years had made it clear to the per- 
ceptions of the Manchu rulers of the Chinese Empire 
that, in these days also, ' what the Barbarians want is 
my territory.' The Barbarians were, it is true, numerous 
and strong, but so were the Chinese. The more they 
reflected on the intolerable situation, the fiercer grew 
the flame of their anger, and the more determined the 
resolution by one master stroke to put an end to their 
bondage. The Chinese Tiger, when roused, is himself 
reputed to be a formidable beast. When he should 
have been equipped with Boxer wings, he would be 
absolutely invincible. With this view, and in this hope 
and confident expectation, was launched such a singular 
crusade as the weary earth, after nineteen centuries of 
experience in the Christian era, and we know not how 
many precedent to that epoch, had never seen before." 

Due weight, as a factor in the outbreaks of 
1900, is assigned to reaction against the ex- 
tensive reform scheme projected by the young 
Emperor Kuang Hsii in 1898. A pathetic 
interest attaches to the heroic attempt of the 
young Manchu ruler to lift his vast empire by 
main force from the ancient ruts, and to set it 
in the ways of progress. His failure was briefly 
advertised in the curt announcement (Sept. 
28, 1898) that Kuang Hsii had abdicated, 
and that the redoubtable Dowager Empress 
had once more assumed the government. Dr. 
Smith laments that 

" There was so little appreciation on the part of Foreign 
Powers of the nature of the crisis. . . . The Empire 
drifted into the whirlpool without the representatives 
of the leading nations of the West realizing that there 
was anything unusual in progress, although the connec- 
tion was of the same sort as that by which a pestilence 
follows a war. The dethronement of Kuang Hsii car- 
ried within itself the fruitful seeds of the Boxer out- 
break." 

Four chapters are devoted to a masterly an- 
alysis of the causes and progress of the Boxer 
movement. The Chinese name of this secret 
society, I Ho Ch'iian, " literally denotes the 
' Fists ' (Ch'iian) of Righteous (or Public) 
(I) Harmony (Ho), in apparent allusion to 
the strength of united force which was to be 
put forth. As the Chinese phrase 'fists and 
feet ' signifies ' boxing and wrestling,' there 
appeared to be no more suitable term for the 
adherents of this sect than ' Boxers,' a desig- 
nation first used by one or two missionary cor- 
respondents of foreign journals in China, and 



later universally accepted on account of the 
difficulty of coining a better one." 

And so, after this elaborate introduction, we 
are led by the author to the heart of his nar- 
rative, — the Siege of the Legations in Peking. 
The rest of the first volume and more than half 
of the second is devoted to the story of those 
eight weeks of suffering and heroism, which 
must go back to the siege of the Lucknow 
Residency in 1857 to find its equal. The 
style, in obedience to the subject, grows more 
abrupt, and takes on the diary form in the 
present tense. Every feature which made the 
days terrible and the nights hideous is given 
its place in this clear and straightforward nar- 
ration. The world knows the outlines well 
enough ; but Dr. Smith's story is as vivid as a 
biograph, and will be eagerly read by all. 

Naturally, we all want to know what so 
acute an observer and so wise a man as Dr. 
Smith thinks will be the outcome ; and so we 
hasten to the last two chapters, " A Twelve- 
month of Foreign Occupation " and " The Out- 
look." There are plenty of ugly passages in 
the accounts of loot, outrage, and murder on 
the part of the allied troops (America's skirts 
being fairly clean), none of which is palliated 
by the author, who says, " There have been 
times when it has seemed as if the foreign 
troops had come to Northern China for the 
express purpose of committing within the short- 
est time as many violations as possible of the 
sixth, the seventh, and the eighth command- 
ments." On the other hand, the conduct of 
the missionaries is justified by so good a judge 
as Minister Conger " before the siege, during 
the siege, and after the siege." 

As to the outlook. Dr. Smith believes that 
the Chinese will continue in the future, as in 
the past, to be moved by moral forces as by no 
others ; and finds the solution in Christianity. 

" It has been in China a disturber, as it always is and 
always has been everywhere. . . . There has been 
much in the method of its propagation in China which 
is open to just criticism, and which at this crucial junc- 
ture ought to be fearlessly exposed, frankly admitted, 
and honestly abandoned, new and better methods re- 
placing those which have proved faulty and unworthy. 
... It is well that the dilemma should be recognized 
and squarely faced. Unless China is essentially altered 
she will continue to * imperil the world's future.' Other 
forces have been to some extent experimented with, and 
have been shown to be hopelessly inadequate. Chris- 
tianity has been tried upon a small scale only, and has 
already brought forth fruits after its kind. When it 
shall have been thoroughly tested, and have had oppor- 
tunity to develop its potentialities, it will give to China, 
intellectually, morally, and spiritually, the elixir of a 
new life."

Such are the concluding words of this re- 
markable book. They will meet with the assent 
of many, the rejection of some : but they must 
command the respect of all who reach them 
after a careful perusal of the 1600 pages that 
precede them. And if the editors of that tenth 
edition of the Encyclopasdia have not as yet

The Marcus Whitman IjEgend.* 



The story of Marcus Whitman has passed 
into history. Everyone thinks that he knows 
how Dr. Whitman undertook a perilous jour- 
ney across the Rocky Mountains in the winter 
of 1842 in order to inform the administration 
at Washington of the inroads that the Hudson's 
Bay Company were making into Oregon ; how 
he exacted promises from President Tyler and 
Secretary Webster not to abandon the terri- 
tory ; and how, by hurrying back and organ- 
izing a great emigration, he saved it to the 
United States. The various versions of this 
story differ in details, but the burden of them 
all is that Whitman saved Oregon. The " sen- 
sation " of the annual meeting of the American 
Historical Association at Detroit a year ago 
was a striking paper by Professor Edward G. 
Bourne of Yale University, which proved not 
only that this story is inaccurate in details but 
that it is entirely unfounded in its main out- 
lines. Dr. Whitman went east not to save 
Oregon but to save his mission. Even if he 
saw Webster and Tyler, there is no reason to 
think that he changed the policy of the ad- 
ministration in the slightest degree. He did 
not organize and could not have organized the 
emigration of 1843, but joined it after its 
organization and rendered valuable assistance 
on the way. Professor Bourne is not the first 
to discover the groundlessness of the Whitman 
story. It was pointed out in Oregon papers 
between 1882 and 1885 by Mr. Elwood Evans 
and by Mrs. F. F. Victor. Mr. Wm. I. Mar- 
shall of Chicago has devoted a dozen years to

the subject, and has brought to light much 
important evidence. But Professor Bourne 
may fairly be regarded as the Columbus of 
the discovery, since he is the first to succeed 
in forcing it upon public attention. His paper 
was printed in the January issue of " The 
American Historical Review." It has recently 
been reprinted in an enlarged and revised form 
in his " Essays in Historical Criticism," issued 
as one of the " Yale Bicentennial Publications." 
In his original paper Professor Bourne con- 
tented himself with proving that the Whitman 
story was without historical foundation. In 
reprinting it he has prefixed another paper in 
which he traces the origin and genesis of the 
legend that has been attached to Whitman's 
name. The story first appeared from 1864 to 
1866, nearly twenty years after Whitman's 
death, in articles in California and Oregon 
papers, originating with H. H. Spalding and 
W. H. Gray, two of Dr. Whitman's associates. 
In the years immediately following his death, 
when he was most likely to have been eulogized, 
not a word was heard of his great political 
services. The Oregon Treaty of 1846 provided 
for compensation to the Hudson's Bay and 
Puget's Sound Companies for their possessory 
rights within the territory of the United States. 
In 1863 a treaty with Great Britain provided 
for the settlement of these claims, and a com- 
mission, acting under the treaty, began their 
examination in 1865 and later awarded |660,- 
000 to the two companies. While this settle- 
ment was pending, most of the mission land 
claims were disallowed by the United States 
government on the ground of abandonment. 
These were the circumstances that furnished 
the motive for the publication of the earliest 
versions of the Whitman story. At about the 
same time Spalding learned that the govern- 
ment had printed and circulated as a public 
document a Catholic account of the Whitman 
massacre, which reflected upon the conduct of 
the Protestant missionaries. Smarting under 
the disparagement of his work, the loss of the 
mission lands, and the fancied injustice of the 
payment of the foreign claims, Spalding de- 
voted himself to a campaign of vindication. 
From 1868 to 1870 he travelled through 
Oregon and other parts of the United States, 
delivering lectures, collecting endorsements, 
inspiring newspaper articles, and securing the 
adoption of resolutions and memorials drafted 
by himself. The burden of these memorials 
was the great service rendered by Dr. Whit- 
man and himself in saving Oregon to the

United States and the justice of the mission 
land claims, though the latter were discreetly 
kept in the background. The object of these 
memorials, aside from the repudiation of the 
Catholic document, may be illustrated by a 
single extract. 

" It is our deliberate conviction that the Lapwai mis- 
sion belongs to the American Board of Foreign Missions 
as the mission home of our Brother Spalding. . . . 
That the interests of the Government and of the tribe 
would be better subserved by the appointment of Mr. 
Spalding there than by any other man. . . . The plea 
of voluntary abandonment of the Lapwai mission . . . 
is simply absurd." 

In 1871 Spalding secured the publication of 
all of these testimonials, petitions, and papers, 
as a Senate document under the title " Early 
Labors of Missionaries in Oregon," and this 
document became the principal source of the 
later versions of the Whitman story. In the 
meantime. Gray, Spalding's associate, pub- 
lished a similar account of Whitman's services 
in his "History of Oregon," issued in 1870. 
Incorporated in a public document and in a 
formal history of the state, written by an early 
settler, later writers, without further investi- 
gation, accepted the story as true. 

At this point began the second propaganda 
of the story. Friends and descendants of the 
missionaries and the churches that had sent 
them out were naturally pleased to discover 
that Oregon had been saved to the United 
States by the missions ; and various persons 
devoted themselves to the diffusion of this im- 
portant information through the medium of 
magazine articles, pamphlets, and books. The 
story received its widest circulation in an his- 
tory of " Oregon : The Struggle for Posses- 
sion," published by Rev. Wm. Barrows in 
1883. This book, by reason of its inclusion 
in a popular series, its issue by a prominent 
publishing house, and the fact that it presented 
the only short and convenient account of the 
Oregon controversy, reached a large sale. Sev- 
eral biographies of Whitman were written. 
Two appeared in 1895, one of them bearing 
the striking title " How Whitman Saved Ore- 
gon." In 1897 the Congregational churches, 
throughout the country, celebrated the anni- 
versary of Dr. Whitman's death as " Whitman 
Day." By systematically importuning writers 
and publishers of school histories of the United 
States to include the story in their text-books, 
its champions have secured for it practically 
universal circulation and universal acceptance. 
Professor Bourne's refutation is complete at 
every point, and it now remains to correct the 



perversion of history that has been wrought. 

Dr. Wm. A. Mowry has been especially con- 
spicuous by reason of the unusual prominence 
that he has given to Whitman in the series of 
school histories of which he is the author. Hi» 
" Marcus Whitman and the Early Days of 
Oregon," published during the summer, is the 
latest and most conservative statement of the 
Whitman story. This book was not hastily 
undertaken as a reply to Professor Bourne, but 
is the result of the careful investigation of many 
years. It is evident, however, that the author 
is not equipped for critical work in history. 
This conclusion is first suggested by the bib- 
liography with which the book opens, thrown 
together as it is without any plan of arrange- 
ment, misquoting titles, omitting dates of pub- 
lication, and containing many errors, among 
which the assignment of the Spalding report 
to the wrong session of Congress may be men- 
tioned. The first impression is further con- 
firmed by the author's treatment of his material. 
He quotes a great deal of personal testimony, 
but fails to evince any appreciation of the dif- 
ference in value attaching to testimony taken 
at different periods, and in many cases omits 
to indicate the time at which the testimony is 
taken. He is also much given to painting his- 
torical pictures to fill up the gaps in the narra- 
tive and to make it interesting, in a way that 
suggests the Rev. Mason Weems. A single 
quotation will serve as an example. The ex- 
perience of Lovejoy, Dr. Whitman's companion 
upon his famous ride, is described as follows : 

" It was the dead of winter. He was one man, alone, 
in the midst of the Rocky Mountains, in an unfrequented 
pass. ... In his solitude during that longest week of 
the entire trip, probably the longest of his life, he must 
have made much of the companionship of their little 
dog. It is sad to think that a little further on in their 
journey, when their provisions had utterly failed, not 
only were they obliged to kill a mule for food to save 
their lives, but stern necessity compelled them to kill 
and eat that faithful dog." 

This picture is apparently based upon Mr. 
Lovejoy 's statement that they were "from want 
of food, compelled to use the flesh of dogs» 
mules, and such other animals as came in their 
reach." It is hardly worth while to point out the 
variations contained in Dr. Mowry's version. 
The important fact is that he applies the same 
methods to the essential points of the story that 
he does to the non-essential. When he comes 
to Whitman's Washington visit, he says : 
" Exactly what happened in Washington is 
difficult to determine. From the best reports 
we feel quite sure that the following account 



42 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



is not far from the truth." Then he gives the 
imaginary conversations with Webster and 
Tyler invented years afterward by Spalding, 
in spite of the fact that there is no direct 
evidence of Whitman's having seen Webster 
and only very uncertain evidence of his seeing 
Tyler. In place of a careful citation of author- 
ities, we find such expressions as " doubtless," 
"it seems probable," " we are told," "from 
the best reports we feel quite sure," and the 
like. 

Dr. Mowry evidently intends to give an im- 
partial account of the life of Whitman, but is 
prevented by his preconceived opinions from 
seeing facts in their true light. Nevertheless, 
he presents much important material ; so that 
it is quite possible, by making allowance for 
his constructions, to read the true life of Whit- 
man in his pages. The main points of this 
life, as already suggested, respect, first, the 
purpose of his ride, second, the incidents and 
object of his visit to Washington, and, third, 
his connection with the emigration of 1843. 
The American Board established its Oregon 
missions in 1836 by sending out Whitman and 
Spalding as missionaries and Gray as agent. 
Two years later the missions were reenforced 
by the addition of Eells, Walker, Smith, and 
Rogers. The missionaries quarrelled fiercely 
among themselves, a fact which Dr. Mowry 
passes over as charitably as possible. In Feb- 
ruary of 1842 the Prudential Committee of 
the Board decided to discontinue the southern 
branch, transfer Whitman to the northern one, 
and recall Spalding. When this order was 
received in September, Dr. Whitman, feeling 
that its execution would be a great mistake, 
called a meeting of the missionaries, to whom 
he communicated his resolution to go east im- 
mediately in order to present his view of the 
situation to the Board. The purpose of his 
journey appears in the authorization of the 
missionaries, which advised Dr. Whitman " to 
visit the United States as soon as practicable 
to confer with the Committee of the American 
Board for Foreign Missions in regard to the 
interests of this mission." Dr. Mowry unac- 
countably omits the last eight words of this 
authorization, as Professor Bourne points out. 
Dr. Whitman's purpose is also clearly stated 
in a letter written by Mr. Walker at the time 
of his departure, which Dr. Mowry erroneously 
attributes to Mr. Eells. There is no sugges- 
tion anywhere of a political motive. Dr. Mowry 
attributes its absence to fear of the Hudson's 
Bay Company and of the condemnation of the 



American Board, but these reasons would not 
have restrained Dr. Whitman from referring 
to it in letters written while in the east to per- 
sons not connected with the Board. Dr. Mowry 
also argues that but for a political motive, Dr. 
Whitman would have waited until spring, since 
a summer trip across the continent would have 
served the purpose of the mission equally well. 
Exactly the reverse appears to us to have been 
the case. The Board in February of 1842 
had ordered the discontinuance of the mission, 
and would expect the order to be obeyed not 
later than the spring of 1843. If the order 
were to be withdrawn, representations must 
reach the Board by that time. Arriving in 
Boston, Dr. Whitman succeeded in securing 
the reversal of the order, and thus accomplished 
his purpose. 

That Dr. Whitman also visited Washington 
appears from a letter that he addressed to the 
Secretary of War after his return to Oregon, 
which began as follows : " Sir, In compliance 
with a request you did me the honor to make 
last winter, while in Washington, I herewith 
transmit to you the synopsis of a bill," etc. 
There is no other contemporary reference to 
Dr. Whitman's Washington visit. In later 
years several persons testified that they re- 
membered having seen him there. Dr. Lyon G. 
Tyler writes that John Tyler, Jr., President 
Tyler's son and secretary, told him that " he 
remembered Whitman very well, that he was 
in Washington, 1842-43, full of his project to 
carry emigrants to Oregon, that he waited 
on the President and received from him the 
heartiest concurrence in his plans." This 
does not necessarily mean much, since it was 
the custom of nearly everyone, who visited the 
national capital, to pay his respects to the 
President. That Dr. Tyler does not regard it 
as sustaining the claim that Whitman in- 
fluenced the administration appears from a 
recent letter to the writer of this review, in 
which he says, "I do not believe that Dr. 
Whitman controlled the policy of President 
Tyler's administration in any way." That 
President Tyler discussed the political situ- 
ation with Dr. Whitman is extremely improb- 
able, since he had refused the request of the 
Senate for information upon the ground that 
he did " not deem it consistent with the public 
interest to make any communication upon the 
subject." A very plausible reason for Dr. 
Whitman's visit to Washington and for his 
interview with the Secretary of War was a de- 
sire to strengthen the title to the mission lands. 



1902] 



THE DIAL.

These lands were held merely under a permit 
from the War Department, and Dr. Whitman 
expressed his anxiety upon the subject in his 
first letter, written to the American Board after 
his return to Oregon, in which he said, " Un- 
less the Board gets a special grant of the land 
the mission occupies, it will be likely to be 
taken from the mission by preemption when- 
ever Congress takes possession of the country 
and grants land to settlers." 

As to Whitman's connection with the emi- 
gration of 1843, Dr. Mowry admits that " it 
can be clearly shown that he was not the sole 
cause of this great westward movement," but 
he endeavors to show that he was one of its 
prime movers. In regard to this emigration 
Dr. Whitman on his way back to Oregon wrote 
the Secretary of the American Board from 
Shawnee Mission: 

" You will be surprised to see that we are not yet 
started. The emigrants have some of them just gone 
and some of them have been gone a week and some are 
yet coming on. I shall start to-morrow. I regret that 
I could not have spent some of the time spent here in 
suspense, with my friends at the East. ... I cannot 
give you much of an account of the emigrants until we 
get on the road. It is said that there are over two hun- 
dred men besides women and children. They look like 
a fair representative of a country population. Few, I 
conclude, are pious. . . . We do not ask you to be the 
patrons of emigration to Oregon, but we ask you to use 
your influence that, in connection with all the influx 
into the country, there may be a fair proportion of 
good men of our own denomination who shall avail 
themselves of the advantages of the country in common 
with others." 

From this letter it appears that Dr. Whitman 
was not only not engrossed with the organization 
of a great emigration, but that he regretted 
the time he was compelled to spend with it, 
and was almost disgusted with its character. 
What Whitman's real plan of emigration was 
appears very clearly in the documents that Dr. 
Mowry presents. It is stated in the letter, 
already cited, written by Mr. Walker, just as 
Dr. Whitman was leaving for the east, and 
repeated in the partial sanction that was given 
it by the American Board. Dr. Whitman 
himself states it in his letter to the Board 
written immediately after his return to Oregon, 
and again in letters written shortly before his 
death in 1847. In all of these statements 
the emigration was regarded solely from the 
standpoint of the missions, and not at all from 
the standpoint of American interest in the 
territory ; a fact wholly inconsistent with the 
theory that Whitman was so devoted to the 
national interests that he undertook his winter 



journey to secure them. What Whitman 
wanted was a small emigration of pious people 
to assist the missions in checking the papists, 
and not the great emigration of all sorts and 
conditions of men that saved Oregon to the 
United States. No one man saved Oregon, but 
the spontaneous movement of masses of men. 
It was a part of that larger movement which, 
beginning with the Allegheny Mountains, in 
little more than a century pushed the American 
frontier across the continent to the Pacific, and 
afforded the most marvellous example of na- 
tional expansion in all history. In that struggle 
Marcus Whitman played a man's part, and, 
like hundreds of others, fell a victim to Indian 
treachery; but that he is entitled, either by 
the breadth of his views or by the measure of 
his achievement, to rank as one of the leaders 
of the struggle cannot for a moment be ad- 
inJtted. Y. H. Hodder. 



Mary Stuart and the 
"Casket IiETters."* 



One who has been following Mr. Andrew 
Lang's literary activities for the last few years 
will recognize in his " Pickle the Spy " and 
" The Companions of Pickle," as well as in his 
more recent volume on " The Mystery of Mary 
Stuart," the by-products of the author's " His- 
tory of Scotland," recently brought to a con- 
clusion. Or, if this designation has a derogatory 
shade, it might be fairer to refer to the books 
first named as the results of the author's pre- 
liminary studies for the latter. It would be 
difficult on any other assumption to understand 
how Mr. Lang should have been inclined to 
devote such minute study, and two impressive 
volumes, to Pickle and Pickle's companions. 
But the same wonder would not be felt regard- 
ing an extended study of Mary Stuart. As 
with her personality in life, so with her memory 
and the problems surrounding her career and 
her fate : the charm is perennial. 

The most serious charges against the char- 
acter of the Scottish queen are involved in the 
partial or complete authenticity of what are 
known as the " Casket Letters," a series of 
eight epistles which first came to light in the 
hands of Balfour, Morton, and other Scotch 
lords hostile to Mary, on the 19th of June, 
four days after the so-called battle of Carberry 
Hill, where Mary was taken captive by her

banded subjects. When produced, the letters 
were in a trunk-shaped box less than a foot 
long, adorned with gold metal filagree. These 
letters, the originals of which disappeared soon 
after their production before the English Com- 
missioners who were examining the charges 
against Mary, in December, 1568, were appar- 
ently without address, date, or signature. Mor- 
ton testified that the casket was taken by George 
Douglas from Dalgleish, a valet of Bothwell's, 
who revealed its existence and hiding-place 
under torture. Dalgleish had come into Edin- 
burgh a few days before June 19, 1567. 
Douglas and Dalgleish then took the casket to 
Morton, who kept it in his sole possession until 
next day, the 21st, and then opened it in the 
presence of various lords. No inventory was 
made of the contents of the casket, the docu- 
ments were not marked, and no minute was 
made of the character of the contents, although 
the assembled lords — all hostile to Mary, and 
some of them privy to the murder of Darnley, 
others to the murder of Riccio — recognized 
the letters as damaging to Mary. After this 
examination, the letters were returned to the 
custody of Morton, who produced them eight- 
een months later before the English Commis- 
sioners and declared that he had not altered 
them. Moray, who conducted the case against 
Mary, required the papers to be re-delivered 
to Morton, various copies and translations hav- 
ing been taken. Morton had possession of the 
casket (with the letters in it?) not long before 
his death in 1581 ; it was heard of for a few 
years longer, and then disappeared from sight 
forever. The supposed originals were never 
collated or examined critically by unprejudiced 
^experts, and their presentation before a com- 
mission when Mary was not present, either in 
person or by counsel, gives them no real value 
as evidence that would stand before a civilized 
court. 

The only form in which the letters exist to- 
day is that of copies or translations, none of 
which are duly certified as true copies. This 
throws the whole burden of the proof upon the 
internal evidence of the compositions, and this 
is vitiated by the fact that the alleged original 
letters were produced from no one knows where, 
by a mortal enemy of Mary, himself a murderer 
and unscrupulous perjurer ; and were, even 
after their production, left for months in his 
irresponsible keeping. 

After a minute and ingenious examination 
of this internal evidence, Mr. Lang inclines to 
the opinion that Letter II., the most compro- 



mising of them all, is probably partly or alto- 
gether a forgery, although there remain circum- 
stances indicating the authenticity of parts of 
it. This letter, if admitted as genuine, would 
prove Mary's connivance at the murder of 
Darnley. Letters IV.-VIII. testify more or 
less clearly to Mary's amour with Bothwell, 
and to her connivance in her own abduction 
and marriage with him. The authenticity of 
these letters Mr. Lang is less disposed to ques- 
tion, although he concedes the possibility that 
all of the eight are forged. If any forgery was 
committed in connection with the letters, Mr. 
Lang inclines to lay it upon Lethington, whose 
duplicity and motives for such action he shows 
forth at length. 

The " Casket Sonnets," sometimes called 
Letter IX., are treated very summarily, ap- 
parently because " a distinguished historian is 
occupied with a critical edition " of them. The 
suggestion that the letters, if forgeries, are 
based upon the sonnets ; that the sonnets were 
the original documents found in the casket ; 
and that their tone and style were developed 
into the letters, with the addition of more in- 
criminating details by the hostile lords, deserved 
a more extended discussion. Mr. Lang regards 
the sonnets as much less open to suspicion of 
forgery than the letters, and at the same time 
finds a decided similarity between them, even 
to the phraseology. He even admits that the 
suspicion we have mentioned " is suggested." 

On the whole, the chapters devoted to the 
discussion of the " Casket Letters " succeed 
admirably in impressing the reader with the 
general untrustworthiness of all the people who 
surrounded Mary, friend or foe. In this maze 
of intrigue, Mr. Lang sets himself the problem 
of figuring out the probabilities of truth. He 
admits us to his study, and invites us to listen 
while he thinks aloud. He weighs this evidence, 
and rejects it ; he considers that testimony, 
and admits that there may be something to it, 
provided — ; he conjectures, he balances, he 
puts himself in the place of both accusers and 
defenders, he wrestles with the calculus of 
probabilities, until at last 

" We feel as stupid from all of that 
As though we'd a mill-wheel under our hat," 

And the author himself is not far from 
coming out " at the same door where in he 
went," — to wit, that Mary was more or less 
guilty, but not so guilty as her enemies have 
said ; and that her accusers are at least as 
bad as she. 

In the opening chapters, describing " The

Dramatis Personae," Mr. Lang is at his best. 
Here we find once more the literary artist who 
was buried under the rubbish of " Pickle the 
Spy." It would be greatly desirable to have 
an entire biography of Mary Stuart completed 
in the style and the manner of these opening 
chapters. For instance, this description of the 
Earl of Morton : 

" The son of the most accomplished and perfidious 
scoundrel of the past generation, Sir George Douglas, 
brother of Angus the brother-in-law of Henry VIII., 
Morton had treachery in his blood. His father had 
alternately betrayed England, of which he was a pen- 
sioner, and Scotland, of which he was a subject. By a 
perverse ingenuity of shame, he had used the sacred 
Douglas heart, the cognizance of the House, the 
achievement granted to the descendants of Good Lord 
James, as a mark to indicate what passages in his trea- 
sonable letters might be relied on by his English em- 
ployers. In Morton's father and uncle had lived on 
the ancient inappeasable feud between Douglases and 
Stewarts, between the Nobles and the Crown. It was 
a feud stained by murder under trust, by betrayal in 
the field and perfidy in the closet. Morton was heir to 
the feud of his family, and to the falseness. . . . His 
sanctimonious snuffle is audible still in his remark to 
Throckmorton, who asked to be allowed to see Mary in 
prison. Morton answered that ' the day being destined 
to the Communion, continual preaching, and common 
prayer, they could not be absent, nor attend matters of 
the world.' ... A red-handed murderer, living in open 
adultery with the widow of Captain Cullen whom he 
had hanged, and daily consorting with murderers like 
his kinsman Archibald Douglas, Morton approached the 
Divine Mysteries. His private life was notoriously 
profligate; he added avarice to his other and more 
genial peccadilloes." 

The fine plates with which this volume is 
liberally supplied add much to the author's 
ability to make the past re-live. But inasmuch 
as there is not in existence a copy of the 
" Casket Letters " in Mary's own hand, it is 
not quite evident why the discussion is accom- 
panied with plates showing her authentic writ- 
ing, with a fac simile of the MS. of the " Casket 
Sonnets " which are not in Mary's hand, and 
a plate by a writing expert showing how Letter 
III. would look in Mary's hand.

A LITTLE book entitled " How to Remember without 
Memory Systems or with Them " (F. Warne & Co.), by 
Eustace H. Miles, is a saner book than most that deal 
with this topic. Though it contains a fair statement 
of the psychology of memory and rational chapters of 
advice, it does not rise sufficiently, either by originality 
or excellence of execution, above the average of its 
class to call for extended remark. 



Strivings with Social, Problems,* 



One of the most imj)ortant of the recent contri- 
butions to our knowledge of society is Professor 
Ross's treatise on " Social Control." It is a fuller 
working out of the thoughts suggested in the author's 
articles published in the " American Journal of 
Sociology " during recent years. Since then, he 
has had excellent opportunity to observe the work- 
ing of a system of control in vogue in California, 
and has made extensive studies in Europe. His 
particular field of investigation has been among 
the Western European peoples and their descend- 
ants in America and Australia. Among these most 
restless and individualistic of men he seeks to dis- 
cover the secret of " that degree of harmony we see 
about us." In general, this harmony is a fabric erect- 
ed by the community and imposed upon the individ- 
ual. But individuals are characterized by certain 
qualities of adaptation to society. The first chapters 
are given to the consideration of these qualities, 
under the titles Sympathy, Sociability, Sense of 
Justice, and Resentment. Under favorable circum- 
stances, these qualities may produce a '' natural 
order." But this is far from perfect, and in course 
of time " society invariably developes a certain 
measure of control over the individual." The need 
of control is shown by illustrations of life in new 
settlements, and its methods are discussed under 
such titles as "Public Opinion," "Law," "Social 
Suggestion," " Art," " Illusions," etc. Social con- 
trol is liable to abuses, such as being used in the 
interests of a class ; and even when properly directed, 
it must be within reasonable limits, for " the art of 
domesticating human beings may succeed only too 
well." 

The third of the studies undertaken by the Com- 
mittee of Fifty for the Investigation of the Liquor 
Problem appears under the title " Substitutes for 
the Saloon." It is written by Mr. Raymond Cal- 
kins, and is the most satisfactory of the three, in 
that it deals with more complex questions and a

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



greater mass of material, by a logical method and 
in a lucid style. The references to the numerous 
preliminary studies made in different cities, as a 
basis for the work, and the extracts from their re- 
ports, convince one of the care with which the 
foundation has been laid. The book is a mine of 
information in regard to various lines of philan- 
thropic work. But, better than that, the material 
is so handled that one finds it most interesting 
reading as well as a convenient book of reference. 
And, best of all, one is impressed by the author's 
keen insight into the real significance of these 
agencies of betterment, and his appreciation of the 
reasons for their incomplete success. The first 
and third chapters, entitled " The Saloon as a Social 
Centre " and <' The Clubs of the People," are par- 
ticularly valuable as showing what the saloon really 
is to the great bulk of its patrons. One feels himself 
in the place of the man at the bar, and is therefore 
in the best position to realize the practical value 
of the various " substitutes " that have been pro- 
posed. This book is a necessity to all rational 
temperance workers ; indeed, it is difl&cult to see 
how anyone interested in the betterment of society 
can afford to be without it. 

In " The Science of Penology," Mr. Henry M. 
Boies has collated and systemized the modern 
doctrines pertaining to this subject. The author's 
official position has made it his duty to study care- 
fully the problems of crime and pauperism, and 
with this book he has filled a serious gap in our 
literature in these fields. Most of the recent pub- 
lications have been more or less fragmentary studies 
of the criminal's nature. These have had their 
important influence in modifying the science, and 
now Mr. Boies gives us an excellent statement of 
its present position. The book ought to be of great 
value to all connected with prison administration, 
and it will certainly be valuable in college and uni- 
versity work. 

" The World of Graft " is a collection of studies 
of the professional thief and swindler in his relation 
to government, some of which have appeared from 
time to time in " McClure's Magazine." Mr. Wil- 
lard has been criticised for his persistent " spying 
upon the unfortunate," but in this book it is less 
the unfortunate and more the rogue that is studied. 
" Graft " is defined as the " generic slang term for 
all kinds of theft and illegal practices generally." 
The grafter " may be a political boss, a mayor, a 
chief of police, a warden of a penitentiary, a mu- 
nicipal contractor, a member of a town council, etc." 
It is this contingency that complicates municipal 
administration. The public sometimes sets a rogue 
to watch a rogue, and each preys upon the other 
and both upon the public. The evidence as to this 
condition is especially clear in the cases of New 
York and Chicago, where the author's statements 
seem to have been somewhat irritating to the police. 
Another attempt to solve the problems growing 
out of over-crowding in cities appears in " Back to 



the Soil," by Mr. Bradley Gilman. A group of 
wealthy men become interested in an attempt to 
found a farm colony that shall possess all the ad- 
vantages of city life without its evils. A tract of 
land four miles square is obtained, and divided in 
such a way that all the houses mav be built in a 
circle about a central park and within a few rods 
of each other. With difficulty, families are induced 
to come from the city slums, and various industries 
are established, including a market in the great city 
for the sale of Circle City products. This, it is 
thought, disposes of the industrial and economic 
questions ; but the task of educating and socializing 
the people is more difficult to handle. Thoughts 
will intrude of our thousands of country villages 
with all the economic advantages of Circle City, 
and nothing more. 

"Tolstoy and his Problems" is the title of a 
series of essays by Aylmer Maude, bearing upon 
Tolstoy's personality and theories, and upon the 
South African war. The author has enjoyed inti- 
mate friendship with Tolstoy, and many of the 
incidents of his daily life and his comments upon 
fellow-reformers are of interest. The tactical value 
of the doctrine of non-resistance seems to make it 
especially attractive to the author, as it gives him a 
fine advantage over the English government and 
the war Quakers. 

In " Social Institutions " Mr. Denton J. Snider 
rounds out his work in psychology with an inter- 
pretation of the institutions of society in the terms 
of the Hegelian School. Though the book is diffi- 
cult reading, the author hopes to render it " intelli- 
gible to any reader who is willing to think a little." 
This requires, however, " a given nomenclature 
which indicates in the word the connecting thought," 
and the exposition" of this nomenclature occupies 
forty pages of the Introduction. The definition of 
institution is important : " Will is actualized in an 
object which is itself Will, and this is a Will which 
wills Will. Such an object which is existent in the 
World as Will, whose end and purpose is to secure 
Will, is an institution." 

In "A Day with a Tramp, and Other Days," 
Mr. Walter A. Wyckoff yields to the public clamor 
for more stories about the American workman, by 
filling in a few of the gaps in his published diary. 
The remarkable reception of "■ The Workers " fully 
warrants the publication of this appendix. It is 
written in the same vivid style, and will make its 
readers still more eager to hear what the author has 
to say about his recent investigations in Europe. 

The appearance of the second edition of Pro- 
fessor Henderson's " Social Spirit in America " 
may well serve as an occasion for congratulating 
the reading public upon its appreciation of this 
work. We have no wiser or more kindly leader in 
social betterment than the author, and certainly 
such a book is one of the strongest forces that make 
for justice and improvement in society.

Recent American Poetry.* 



In its recent bicentennial celebration, Yale Uni- 
versity was fortunate in more ways than one, but 
in no way more fortunate than in numbering among 
its sons the foremost of our living poets. It was 
preordained in the fitness of things that Mr. Edmund 
Clarence Stedman should be the poet of the occa- 
sion, and that he should respond to the call with an 
ode entirely worthy of himself and of his alma 
mater. The " Mater Coronata," recited by him 
last October at New Haven, is a poem dignified and 
severe almost to the point of bareness. It is un- 
adorned by the minor rhetorical graces, but it is 
weighty with thought and the burden of the highest 
ideals of the spirit. Two stanzas occurring midway 
in the poem may be taken to represent the quality 
of the whole. 

" No oracle betokened the obscure 
Grim years encountering which the elders bowed, 
Yet know not faintness nor discomfiture, 
But set the buttress sure 
That should upstay these tabernacles proud ; 

" These fanes, that bred their patriot to vie 
In steadfastness, erect of thought to live, 
Or, when the country bade, undauntedly 
Without lament to die 
Save that he had but one young life to give." 

There are twenty-seven of these stanzas in all,

logically knit together for the unfolding of their 
high argument. 

Another of the small volumes of verse that are 
collected every few years by Mr. Richard Watson 
Gilder has just been published with the title, 
" Poems and Inscriptions." The poems are mostly 
occasional, reminiscences of consecrated places, 
and tributes to great men, such, for example, as 
the piece inscribed to Beethoven, and suggested by 
a visit to the house of the composer in Vienna. 
" Here unto the bitter end abode 
He who from pain wrought noble joy for men. 
He who from silence gave the world to song ; 
For in his mind an awful music rose 
As when, in darkness of the under-seas. 
Currents tremendous over currents pour. 
He heard the soundless tone, its voice he was, 
And he of vast humanity the voice, 
And his the empire of the human soul." 

The " Inscriptions " of this volume were written 
for the buildings of the Pan-American Exposition, 
and are conceived in the spirit of a fine literary art. 
The last of them is " To the statesmen, philosophers, 
teachers, and preachers, and to all those who, in 
the new world, have upheld the ideals of liberty 
and justice, and have been faithful to the things 
that are eternal." 

Among the poets of the younger generation in 
this country there are not more than three or four 
whose achievement reaches the level of Mr. George 
Santayana's work. In his new volume, " A Hermit 
of Carmel, and Other Poems," he displays his 
varied gifts — melody and mysticism, passion and 
philosophy — in ampler measure than hitherto, and 
wins the respect of all lovers of serious poetry. For 
the title-poem and its sequel, dramatic in form 
rather than in treatment, we care less than for the 
lyrical numbers that follow. Of these, the very first 
strikes the philosophical note most characteristic of 
Mr. Santayana's work. The verse is of the brooding 
sort, with a haunting and melancholy sweetness all 
its own. The poem is called " Premonition." 

" The mnffled syllables that Nature speaks 
Fill us with deeper longing for her word ; 
She hides a meaning that the spirit seeks. 
She makes a sweeter music than is heard. 

" A hidden light illumines all our seeing. 
An unknown lore enchants our solitude. 
We feel and know that from the depths of being 
Exhales an infinite, a perfect good. 

" Though the heart wear the garment of its sorrow 
And be not happy like a naked star. 
Yet from the thought of peace some peace we borrow. 
Some rapture from the rapture felt afar. 

" Our heartstrings are too coarse for Nature's fingers 
To wake her purest melodies upon. 
And the harsh tremor that among them lingers 
Will into sweeter silence die anon. 

" We catch the broken prelude and suggestion 
Of things unuttered, needing to be sung ; 
We know the burden of them, and their question 
Lies heavy on the heart, nor finds a tongue. 

" Till haply, lightning through the storm of ages, 
Our sullen secret flash from sky to sky, 
Glowing in some diviner poet's pages 
And swelling into rapture from this sigh."

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



A sheaf of translations comes next after the lyrical 
section of the volame, and includes examples of 
Michelangelo, Musset, and Gautier. Greatly dar- 
ing, hut justified of his venture, Mr. Santayana has 
translated Gautier's marvellous poem, " L'Art." 
We had thought that the paraphrase of Mr. Dob- 
son's " Ars Victrix " was the best that could be 
hoped for as a version of this poem in English, but 
Mr. Santayana has given us a true translation, so 
nearly perfect that we are lost in admiration of his 
skill. We must quote the last part of this tour de 
force, wishing that we had space for the whole. 

" Show in their triple lobe 
Virgin and Child, that hold 

Their globe 
Cross- crowned and aureoled. 

" — All things return to dust 
Save beauties fashioned well. 

The bust 
Outlasts the citadel. 

'' Oft doth the ploughman's heel. 
Breaking an ancient clod. 

Reveal 
A Csesar or a god. 

"The gods, too, die, alas! 
But deathless and more strong 

Than brass 
Remains the sovereign song. 

" Chisel and carve and file, 
Till the vague dream imprint 

Its smile 
On the unyielding flint." 

Translation can do nothing better than this, which 
must always stand as one of the supreme achieve- 
ments of its kind. Mr. Santayana's section of 
" Convivial and Occasional Verses " reveals the 
poet in a new character. His touch is not quite 
light enough for felicity in this manner, but we 
have read with a good deal of satisfaction the story 
of " Young Sammy's First Wild Oats." The theme 
may be gathered from these remarks of the Deacon 
to the Doctor — 

" Cousin Sammy's gone a-tooting 
To the Creole County fair. 
Where the very sun's polluting 
And there's fever in the air. 
He has picked up three young lasses, 

Three mulattoes on the mart, 
Who have offered him free passes 

To their fortune and their heart. 
One young woman he respected, 
Vowed he only came to woo. 
But his word may be neglected 
Since he ravished the other two." 

These, be it observed, are the antics of young 
Sammy, and there is a world of meaning in what 
follows : 

" Now he looks on outraged faces 

And can laugh, defying God : 
He can stretch his hand, relieving. 

And strike down a cheated slave. 
Oh, if Uncle Sam were living. 

This would bring him to his grave I " 

This excellent fooling serves, as it were, to usher 
in the noble poem called " Spain in America," 
which occupies the penultimate place in the volume. 



It is a philosophical panorama of the historical 
fortunes of Spain in both the old world and the 
new, and in it the Spanish blood of the author finds 
expression in many proud imaginings. 

" By sloth and lust and mindlessness and pelf 
Spain sank in sadness and dishonour down, 
Each in her service serving but himself. 
Each in his passion striking at her crown. 
Not that these treasons blotted her renown 
Emblazoned higher than such hands can reach : 
There where she reaped but sorrow she has sown 
The balm of sorrow ; all she had to teach 
She taught the younger world — her faith and heart and 
speech. 

" And now within her sea-girt walls withdrawn 
She waits in silence for the healing years. 
While where her sun has set another dawn 
Comes from the north, with other hopes and fears. 
Spain's daughters stand, half ceasing from their tears. 
And watch the skies from Cuba to the Horn. 
' What is this dove or eagle that appears,' 
They seem to cry, ' what herald of what morn 
Hovers o'er Andes' peaks in love or guile or scorn ? ' " 

A characterization of Abraham Lincoln opens 
the new volume of poems by Mr. Edwin Markham. 
It yields such fine verses as these : 

" The color of the ground was in him, the red earth ; 
The tang and odor of the primal things — 
The rectitude and patience of the rocks ; 
The gladness of the wind that shakes the corn ; 
The courage of the bird that dares the sea ; 
The justice of the rain that loves all leaves ; 
The pity of the snow that hides all scars ; 
The loving-kindness of the wayside well ; 
The tolerance and equity of light 
That gives as freely to the shrinking weed 
As to the great oak flaring to the wind — 
To the grave's low hill as to the Matterhom 
That shoulders out the sky." 

The ring of these lines is rather rhetorical than 
poetical, and this we find true of most of Mr. 
Markham's work. He is so moved by social passion, 
and so eager to proclaim the gospel of human 
brotherhood that he confuses the boundary line be- 
tween the sermon and the song. 

" What do we need to keep the nation whole. 
To guard the pillars of the State ? We need 
The fine audacities of honest deed ; 
The homely old integrities of soul ; 
The swift temerities that take the part 
Of outcast right — the wisdom of the heart ; 
Brave hopes that Mammon never can detain, 
Nor sully with his gainless clutch for gain." 
Admirable doctrine, no doubt, but not exactly poetry. 
When preaching becomes prophecy, we get much 
the same thing. 

" Be constellated, star by circling star ; 
Give to all mortals justice and forgive: 
License must die that liberty may live. 
Let Love shine through the fabric of the State — 
Love deathless, Love whose other name is Fate. 
Fear not, we cannot fail — 
The Vision will prevail. 

Truth is the Oath of God, and, sure and fast, 
Through Death and Hell holds onward to the last." 

In two of these poems, " The Angelas " and " The 
Sower," Mr. Markham turns to the inspiration that 
gave him the best-known of his pieces. This is 
from " The Sower ": 



1902.] 



THE DIAL 



49 



" Not his the lurching of an aimless clod. 
For with the august gesture of a god — 
A gesture that is question and command — 
He hurls the bread of nations from his band ; 
And in the passion of the gesture flings 
His fierce resentment in the face of kings." 

We much doubt if the sower does anything of this 
sort. But the poetry of his act was once expressed 
by Victor Hugo in lines of which Mr. Markham 
gives us only a faint echo. 

" Pendant que, d^ployant ses voiles, 
L'ombre, oil se roSle une rnmeur, 
Semble 6largir jusqu'aux ^toiles 
Le geste auguste du semeur," 

We are impelled to a closing comment by Mr. 
Markham's line — 

" The shy arbutus glimmers in the wood." 
We do not wish to be hypercritical, but a poet is 
bound to look to his accents, and the word " arbu- 
tus " has been greatly abused. Mr. Herbert Spencer 
speaks scornfully of the man who is not ashamed to 
be ignorant of the Eustachian tubes, but who would 
blush if caught saying " Iphig^nia." Now for such 
a man we should feel sympathy rather than scorn. 
One can be well-educated without knowing anything 
of the Eustachian tubes, but ignorance concerning 
the pronunciation of "Iphig^nia" betokens a vital 
defect of culture. 

Mr. Clinton ScoUard is a poet who needs no in- 
troduction ; his eight volumes of verse have already 
secured for him a high place among our writers of 
taste and refinement. A ninth volume is "The 
Lutes of Morn," beautifully printed in a private 
and limited edition. 

" Hold them, I pray you, not in niter scorn. 
These broken echoes of the Lutes of Morn ! " 

he adjures his readers, with greater modesty than 
is needful. The volume contains ballads, lyrics, and 
sonnets, all upon Oriental themes, marked by rich 
coloring and graceful diction. 

"Orchards stretch their bloomy span 

Round the walls of Hamadan ; 

Purples deepen on the grape ; 

Lyric brooks make blithe escape ; 

Yet are all the glories gone 

That the lord of Macedon 

Saw, ere drew the orgy on. 

And the Bacchic revel ran 

Round the walls of Hamadan." 

This is the kind of verse that Mr. Aldrich used to 
give us, with more, perhaps, of fancy, but less of 
actuality, in the days when he was still a man of 
letters. We must quote in full Mr. ScoUard's verses, 
« By the Waters of Galilee." 

"The wind is low in the oleanders, 
Softly stirring the rosy sea ; 
Oat from the hill a rill meanders 
Down to the waters of Galilee. 

"A burning blazon of blue enamels 

The rainless heaven that arches o'er ; 
And Druses drowse by their crouching camels. 
Where meadows dip to the shingly shore. 

*' Grumbling walls that the hyssop clings to, 
Such is Magdala's glory now ; 
And the only ear that the cuckoo sings to 
Is that of the mate on the carol bongh. 



" The columned city that Herod fashioned. 
That glistened white in the noonday blaze, 
Naught is left of its past impassioned 
Save ghosts that wander its squalid ways. 

"Never a sail nor a galley oaring 

The shimmering reaches of liquid calm ; 
Only a watchful vulture soaring 
Over the crest of a lonely palm. 

"But still the mountains, violet, vernal, 

And the brooding vales where the shepherds be, 
And the sun, in its equipoise eternal, 
Looking down upon Galilee. 

" And ever, to halo the desert places. 

By the spell of the girdling silence bound. 
The haunting thought of the face of faces. 
Of Him through whom this is holy ground." 

From the lute to the violin is a natural transition, 
and so we come next to Mr. Alfred L. Donaldson's 
volume. These " Songs of My Violin " are intro- 
duced by a " Prelude " that takes our thought back 
to the old instruments and their makers. 

"For, as the sea-shells found along the shore 
Retain the echoes of the ocean's roar 
And murmur with the music of the spheres — 
So are old violins inlaid with song 
Distilled of memories that throb and throng 
Athwart their dream-life of a thousand years." 

To each string of the violin the writer's fancy has 
assigned a characteristic color, G being silver, D 
red, A white, and E gold. Then the spirit of each 
string announces its own character, and at once 
breaks into song. Thus the E string, heralded very 
properly by an excerpt from the " Rheingold," in- 
spires the ifollowing verses : 

" From a golden isle, in the sunset sea, 
I bring a golden gift for thee. 
In the wondrous island a fairy dwells, 
Where earthly sighs are asphodels. 
At a spinning-wheel, spinning all day long, 
She weaves the sunshine into song. 
And she spins it straight into magic strings 
For harps through which the zephyr sings 
When it sighs through heaven the hour of rest — 
The mild-voiced curfew of the West. 
One of these she sends as a gift for thee ; 
A golden, sunbeam-woven ' E' I " 

A few " Stray Songs and Sonnets," upon musical 
and other themes, complete the contents of this col- 
lection. We are a little startled by the symbolism of 

" Begotten 'neath the sign of three glad sharps, 
From its blue cradle in the Key of A, 
The firstling chord is weaned and launched in air," 

but the author assures us that his arbitrary as- 
sumptions have no serious philosophy underlying 
them. 

The Bishop of Peoria has a deserved reputation 
as a writer of graceful and scholarly essays, uphold- 
ing the highest ideals of thought and conduct ; but as 
a poet he is less widely known. His volume entitled 
" God and the Soul " is a sonnet-sequence of the 
spiritual life, divided into four books, each of which 
is prefaced by three or four lyrical preludes. A 
characteristic sonnet, fairly representative of its 
nearly two hundred fellows, is the one called 
" Transformation."

Qrow like Him, luminous, pure, and serene. 

They live in worlds where all is calm and clear 
As cloudless skies and windless streams between. 

They walk the solemn shores of time, and hear 
The waves break on eternal shores unseen." 

This elevation of soul is maintained — no mean 
achievement — throughout the entire series of Bishop 
Spalding's sonnets. They are open to the complaint 
of diffuseness, of uneven execution, and of a too 
facile diction, but their spirituality is unfailing, and 
they must take a high place in the class of religious 
and meditative verse to which they belong. They 
seem to us quite as good, for example, as the poems 
of " The Christian Year." 

"The Feast of Thalarchus," by Mr. Cond^ 
Benoist Fallen, is a dramatic poem of the early 
days of Christianity. Thalarchus, feasting with 
his sensual crew at Antioch, is vouchsafed a vision 
of Simeon upon his pillar, beset by the demons who 
strive to possess the soul of the saint. The spectacle 
moves Thalarchus to the depths of his soul, and, as 
one in a trance, he beseeches Simeon to pray for 
him, the companions of his orgy meanwhile regard- 
ing him with mingled wonder and amusement. The 
devotion of Simeon avails both to repulse the de- 
mons and to reclaim the soul of Thalarchus, who, 
awakening from his stupor, proclaims his conver- 
sion. There are both poor and good verses in this 
poem. For the former we may take the lines : 
" Daintiest meats unknown 
In this our Antioch before, to spur 
The jaded appetites of ancient revellers ; 
Succulent dishes dressed by so rare art 
That sated gluttons shall hunger at the sight ; 
Such subtle witcheries for eye and ear 
That they shall swoon with giddy surfeit ; Beauty 
So prodigal of all her charms that Venus' 
Self would stale upon the general eye." 

As an offset to this specimen of slovenly workman- 
ship, we will select a passage from Simeon's song 
of praise. 

" And so the whole round world 
And the respondent heavens, O Lord, utter 
Thy glory and make manifest thy praise ! 
For thine the gentle silence of the night, 
And thine the softness of the balmy air, 
And thine the sweet refreshment of repose 
And strength renewed in man and beast and fowl ; 
And thine the glory of the golden moon, 
And all the splendour of the rising sun 
Shedding the benediction of its light 
Upon the waking world." 

By way of contrast to the unrelieved seriousness 
of the two volumes just noticed, we now take up 
two volumes of verse in lighter vein. Mr. Charles 
Henry Webb's " With Lead and Line along Vary- 
ing Shores " is a worthy successor to his " Vagrom 



Verse " of a dozen years ago. It is a warm-hearted 
book of wit and tenderness, of unpretentious effort 
and genuine feeling. Here is a specimen fragment : 

" Of all the ages ever known, 
Of Brass or Bronze, of Brick or Stone, 
The blackest and the worst, I think. 
Is this pestiferous Age of Ink. 
In volume vast the torrent pours. 
Its volumes blocking all outdoors ; 
And fed and fattened as it flows 
With verses scanned and potted prose. 
Though all would dam it, — and some do, — 
The Deluge still is apres nous.^^ 

Most of these pieces are personal or occasional, and 
their felicitous lightness of touch may.be well illus- 
trated by the closing stanzas of the tribute paid to 
Mr. Stedman a year ago, when the veteran poet 
was the guest of honor at the Authors' Club. 

" Yet if one have a catboat, dear, 

Instead of a balloon, 
Without some friendly slant of wind 

One cannot make the moon. 
So, while all other brows and ears 

With laurel thou dost twine. 
Although they be less prominent, 

Oh, please remember mine. 

" And I will drink, when I get where 

There 's something fit to drink, 
Instead of stuff as thin as though 

Each author brought his ink — 
A cup to him who from his heart 

Pours Poesy's choicest wine. 
And as a critic never wrote 

Or thought — one unkind line." 

Our second volume of fanciful and sentimental 
verse is Mr. Ray Clarke Rose's " At the Sign of 
the Ginger Jar " — a title that will be familiar to 
readers of a certain Chicago newspaper, in whose 
columns many of these pieces first saw the light. 
Their merit is much above the average of news- 
paper poetry, and the approved masters of vers de 
sociSti might have been glad to sign them. A 
pretty trifle is " Dolly in the Rain." 

" When Dolly tiptoed in the rain 

The shameless sun peeped out to see — 

Well, certain charming things were plain 

When Dolly tiptoed in the rain ! 

I peeped out too, but with disdain 
The saucy maiden glanced at me. 

When Dolly tiptoed in the rain 
The shameless sun peeped out to see." 

No less dainty, but a shade more serious, are the 
two quatrains called "Star Tracks." 

" Alone in bed at night I lie 
And watch the stars that dot the sky ; 
They are so yellow and so bright 
I call them daisies of the night. 

" When day returns I step abroad 
To view the wondrous works of God, 
And yellow daisies, as I pass, 
Shine out like stars upon the grass." 

Mr. Rose has produced a very charming volume, 
delicate in sentiment, and graceful in expression. 
Fifty other examples might be quoted that are 
quite as good as the two we have chosen.

THE DIAL 



61 



The far West now claims our attention with two 
volames of verse, and we are recalled to more se- 
rious moods. " In the Realms of Gold," by Mr. 
Lorenzo Sosso, is a very serious book indeed, and 
its themes are of the highest — God and the human 
soul. There is nothing very striking in the volume ; 
its contents are of a kind that a hundred minor 
poets are putting forth every year. A favorable 
example is this pleasing but not distinguished trib- 
ute to " The Morning Star." 

*' I thrill with joy to view afar 
The pale resplendent morning star : 
Radiant within the pearl-gray skies 
Before the burning snn arise, 
As each wan flower is glistening, 
As early bird s begin to sing. 
It seems some vestal pure and fair 
Within Qod's vast cathedral there. 

" It is the star in all the host 
Of stars that I still love the most ; 
The star of hope, the star of love. 
Who in those regions pure above, 
Seems in its passionless repose 
Like to a white and virgin rose 
Placed by a seraph on that shrine 
Whose holy incense blends with mine." 

Our other Californian is Mr. Lionel Josaphare, 
and his book has the strange name, "Turquoise 
and Iron." The explanation quickly follows, and 
this is its fashion : 

" The innocently azure skies allure. 

Like turquoise hopes above an iron world. 

In happy passion or in mood obscure. 

The innocently azure skies allure. 

But, oh ! when toiling toward a vision pure, 
The beaten body to the earth is hurled, 

The innocently azure skies allure. 
Like turquoise hopes above an iron world." 

The principal poem in this volume is called " The 
Winged Heart." In the second stanza, this heart 
is addressed as a "bleeding ace." A later stanza 
is the following : 

"Still the living, living soul 
Pines within its human hole. 
And, without the boldened knife. 
Sits that hideous, tortured thing, that tortured cripple, hu- 
man life. 

'Tis a serpent's fangy jole. 
And the foldings of its tail still in the cursed future roll. 
And here seek I to explain 
Why my haunted crisscross brain 
In this manor should be dwelling while my heart flies in the 
rain." 

This poet should give his " crisscross brain " a rest. 
His unregulated imaginings are much too ambitious. 
Why, we wonder, do these California poets put their 
portraits in their volumes. 

Some months ago, we found Christopher Mar- 
lowe in a historical romance, and now he is pre- 
sented to us in a five-act tragedy, the work of Miss 
Josephine Preston Peabody. It is a daring thing 
to follow in the footsteps of Home, whose " Mar- 
lowe " is known to all lovers of English poetry, a 
daring thing to embody the soul of 

"Our morning star, sole risen before the sun," 
in any form of imaginative composition. But Miss 
Peabody has been venturesome before this, for in 



her " Fortune and Men's Eyes " she set speech 
upon the lips of Shakespeare. In this tragedy of 
" Marlowe," we have the figure of the fiery-hearted 
poet, glowing with the passion for perfection which 
made him solitary even when surrounded by his 
boon companions. Greene, Peele, Lodge, and Nash 
all appear, and Richard Bame, of evil memory. 
The play begins with the success of " Faustus," 
and ends with Marlowe's death in the tavern at 
Deptford. He engages in the brawl with Francis 
Archer, but is made to die by his own hand, his 
indignant spirit gladly escaping from a world in 
which the fairest-seeming things are the most de- 
ceitful, in which hypocrisy and insincerity are the 
passports to success. The scene in the third act 
with Her Ladyship, the woman of rank in whose 
love he had once believed, offers the fine passage 
which we here reproduce. 

"O Helena, 
How cheaply at the last you sell your God ! 
Thirty pieces of silver, I had sworn 
Would be too little. Ah, but not for you. 
Not even with a kiss, but with a lie. 
You shew me how you rate Him, — all of you ! 
I waited for the reason. There had been 
A chance to make you glorious with some truth, — 
And me to blink at unaccustomed gold : 
A brave * I love you not, — I wish you gone ! ' — 
Such valor of the devil as he respects ! 
But this poor coinage of an outcast metal. 
Stamped with God's image I Ha, deny Him, I ? 
What have I seen of Him that I should know 
Where He is or is not ? I have searched the mire. 
And found Him not, indeed ; and for such temples 
As Holy Writ would have it that He dwells in. 
Look you, how cold and empty ! — Cold, not pure. 
No flame of heaven or hell, — no fire at all. 
Deny Him, I ? And thou, dost thou affirm ? — 
Living denial ! — Gentle blasphemy ! 
Will you begone ? Nay, hear my parting word. 
Unmask yon, Helen. — Truly you must go 
The way of dreams. Will you believe you live ? 
No, no, I think not, no indeed, not you ! 
The fire burns out and leaves the ashes there. 
The cock crows and the spirits must begone. 
1 took you for a Woman, thing of dust, — 
I — I who showed you first what you might be ! 
But see now, you were hollow all the time, 
A piece of magic. Now the air blows in. 
And you are gone in ashes. Well, begone ! 
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust ! — Nay, go." 

This heartless woman whose falsity makes of all life 
a hideous mockery to the poet is effectively con- 
trasted with the gentle Kentish maiden whose pure 
memory saves for him some remnant of his faith 
in mankind. She is an exquisite figure, limned with 
delicate art. We have read Miss Peabody 's play 
— every word of it — with genuine pleasure. The 
poetry and character of the historical Marlowe have 
always seemed to us to provide a sort of touchstone 
of taste and judgment ; who loves the one and under- 
stands the other cannot go very far astray either in 
poetical appreciation or in human sympathy. 

" The Heart of the Road, and Other Poems," by 
Miss Anna Hempstead Branch, is a volume of 
serious lyrics, touched by mysticism, and expressive 
of an abstract mode of thought. They seem to 
derive in some measure from Rossetti, although the 



52 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



inspiration is not always as evident as in " The 
Watch-Tower of the Soul," for example. 

" I will be silent in my soal 

Since God has girt me round 

With His own silences in which 

There is no space for sound. 

Only His voice perchance may drop 

Like dew upon the ground. 

" I will be silent and will lean 

Myself into all space. 
Love, didst thou think in all this life 

That thou couldst touch my face ? 
Nay, for God bade that I should turn 

Unto Himself for grace." 

This archaic mannerism and afEectation of naivete 
has to be very well done indeed to be convincing. 
Miss Branch's verses become a little monotonous, 
but they have a good deal of the poetic spirit and 
much subtlety of rhythmical effect. 

Miss Dickinson's new volume opens with " The 
Cathedral," a poem in sections, providing a sort of 
poetic inventory of a cathedral, from the chimes to 
the cloister close. " The High Altar," for example, 
is thus celebrated : 

" A throne with King invisible, that stands 
For deathless dynasties not made with hands, 
Founded on certainty of things unseen, 
Whose law is perfect and whose fear is clean. 
Whose sovereign majesty doth condescend 
Unto the lowliest of them wljo bend 
Far down beneath upon the humblest stair, 
Submissive subjects of the altar's care." 

Miss Dickinson's poems are nearly all inspired by a 
rather vague religious sentiment, and their expres- 
sion is too strained to be effective. Her interpreta- 
tion of natural beauty seems to us finer than her 
religious philosophizing. The really beautiful 
" Vale ! " may be given as an illustration of her 
work at its best. 

" Now let the frosty sentence pass ! 
For I have garnered astors in my soul. 
To blur with sentiment the stolid year, 
Beyond the largess of their purple dole. 
And I have wrung the life-blood from the hours, 
Forgot old pain amid the russet wold. 
Steeped love in azure and immensity. 
And burned regret in scarlet and in gold. 
Ventured the circle of the hazel witch. 
And claimed of gusty winds rough brotherhood — 
And buried in my heart a rain-wet path 
That led to sunset lurid through a wood. 
Amid gray embers one hot hope is let — 
A torch unto a royal memory. 
And through the benison of dying leaves 
Blows my consent unto the chill decree. 
Now is all prophecy fulfilled ! 
Thy rustling footfall. Autumn, bear thee soon 
Within the dim, unmeasured hills of Time 
Led by the waning of the hunter's moon I " 

The " Sonnets and Songs " of Mrs. Charles Ken- 
dall Adams make up a volume of verse that marks 
a distinct advance upon the author's earlier " Choir 
Invisible." The new poems are richer in content 
and more flexible in style than the old ones were. 
Since the sonnet is the form chiefly favored by 
Mrs. Adams, we select a sonnet for our illustration, 
one equally fine in thought and in expression. It 
is called " Cuba to the United States." 



" Is thine the land that bore the honored name 

Of Washington ? — the land where Lincoln died ? 

Counting the cause of freedom sanctified 
So long as earth shall glorify their fame ? 
Look to it that thou smother not the flame 

They kindled, lest it be in time denied. 

And all their lofty leading thus defied. 
The womb that bore them know a bastard's shame ! 

" I stand with outstretched arms and bleeding heart. 

As in the name of ' Liberty ' I plead ; 
Arise ! and fear alone the envenomed dart 

That searcheth, worse than death, ignoble deed ; 
Yea, read on tombs of those who died for Right, 
No bloodless sword did yet a tyrant smite." 

Something like half a hundred of these sonnets 
make up a sort of cycle upon Shakespearian themes 
and characters, and are characterized by insight 
and sympathetic feeling alike. 

Miss Dorothy King's " Verses " are very simple 
things indeed, and make up a modest sheaf of about 
twoscore pages. "First Notes of Spring" is a 
pretty bit of song. 

" Little brown buds on the lilac-bushes. 
Curling leaves where the tulips wake. 
Glimpses of green from sleeping jonquils. 
Chirpings sweet which the sparrows make. 

" Tinkling sounds where the brooks are playing. 
Brilliant moss where the gray stones lie. 
Golden gleams from a happy crocus 
Greeting the Spring with ecstacy. 

" Soothing breath of the warm winds blowing, 
Twitt'ring music the robins sing. 
Then, with its thrill of perfect beauty. 
Comes the flash of a blue-bird's wing." 

Last on our present list comes " The Destiny, 
and Other Poems," by Miss Florence Brooks. The 
title-poem is a set of lyrics loosely strung together, 
in which we have vainly sought for a unifying 
principle. The best of the lyrics is this : 

" The body is not, love, save for the soul ; 

Dumb is the flesh and dead. 
Thy essence is elusive as the scroll 

Woven and formed and fled 
When the blue waves of forest smoke unroll 

Their tendrils overhead. 

" I have grown sacred, love, because of you, 

Because of these blest hours ; 
And wine is as my mouth, and honey-dew 

My tears, and many flowers 
My flesh, and all my veins the heaven's blue, — 

The chrism of love is ours." 

Aside from the difficulty of picturing a wave with 
tendrils, these stanzas are not bad. An '' Ode to 
the Mountains " is one of the more ambitious pieces 
in this collection, and we quote the opening stanzas : 
'' The dreaming mountains lie athwart the plain 
In plentitude of pride and distant calm ; 

Their grandeur is a psalm 
Of vaster harmonies than human tongue 
Creates to voice its pain — 
A lovely anthem from their inmost caverns sprung. 

" Yet far within that lofty wooded height 

Are sweet and sacred haunts my soul may see. 

Unknown, forever free 
From profanation of the blinded crowd 
That struggles in the night 
Below the towering summit's earthward drooping cloud." 

William Morton Payne.

in the seventeenth century, and again from east to 
west along the line of De Soto's and Cabeza de 
Vaca's wanderings in the previous century, naust 
have a story to tell. Such a story Mr. Paul Fountain 
has attempted in " The Great Deserts and Forests 
of North America" (Longmans). As a tale of 
adventure, the work might have been greatly im- 
proved by giving it somewhat more of human in- 
terest and paying more regard to personal episodes 
which must have been of a thrilling nature. As a 
book of travel, it could have been made more in- 
forming if the writer had taken the trouble to 
identify his routes upon some map of modern date, 
and thus have adopted a more acurate geographical 
nomenclature ; and also if his recorded impressions 
of men — white, black, and red — had been more 
generally correct. But the book is evidently not 
intended to serve either as a tale of adventure or 
a book of travel. The writer's chief incentive in 
making these extensive journeys far away from the 
haunts of men was an intense love for natural his- 
tory. While not technically a naturalist, — a fact 
which he frequently deplores, — he yet made copious 
notes of his close observations of natural phenomena ; 
and these would be of great value at the present 
time, when such a widespread popular interest is 
taken in the various branches of natural history, 
were it not that they must be used with great 
caution. For there are abundant opportunities for 
errors to creep into a transcription of notes made 
more than a quarter of a century since, however 
accurate those notes may have been in the first in- 
stance. The author has had frequent occasion to 
correct himself by means of footnotes and append- 
ices, and the reader will discover many instances 
where errors have escaped his attention. The value 
of the notes, even when correct, might have been 
enhanced had the book been furnished with an in- 
dex. Mr. Fountain is an Englishman, and has 
written for English readers ; and his book is, un- 
fortunately, likely to perpetuate erroneous ideas 
regarding America and the Americans already too 
widely held among English stay-at-homes. 

Dr. William Mason, of New York, 
Sr/mai^n. ^^^ the distinction of being the dean 

of the musical profession in America. 
For over fifty years he has been closely associated 
with musical affairs in this country and abroad ; 
and in his " Memories of a Musical Life " (Cen- 
tury Co.) he writes frankly, yet from a professional 
standpoint, of the development of music during the 
second half of the nineteenth century. Dr. Mason 
was born in Boston on January 24, 1829, the son 
of Lowell Mason — widely known as the composer 
of hymn tunes and sacred melodies, and the man 



through whose efforts music was introduced into 
the public schools of Boston. He displayed his 
fondness for music at an early age, and was sent 
abroad to obtain a musical education, intending to 
study under Moscheles, Hauptmann, and Richter. 
Through the misunderstanding of a letter, he did 
not begin his instruction with Liszt until four years 
later ; he gives a very careful account of his first 
lesson with the great composer, and explains the 
characteristics of Liszt's method. In his chapter 
on " Music in America To-day," he says : " Enormous 
progress in the art and science of music has been 
made in America since I began my studies in 
Germany in 1849. . . . The time has gone by when 
it was necessary for students of the piano to go 
abroad to complete a musical education. There 
are now teachers of the piano of the first rank in 
all our principal cities, who secure better results 
with American pupils than foreign teachers do, be- 
cause they have a better understanding of our 
national character and temperament." Though the 
few original musical exercises included in the book 
appear at a casual glance to be simple, they are the 
result of long and laborious study. In fact, through- 
out the work the strong musical bent of the author's 
mind is very marked. It is not alone the nice 
points, the apices juris of interpretation and con- 
struction, that he cares about or closely examines ; 
it is rather the broad general principles which lie, 
or ought to lie, at the basis of all interpretation. 
Dr. Mason has numbered among his friends a long 
line of celebrities, and he writes about many of the 
great musicians in a reminiscent manner, though 
there is a plentiful intersprinkling of criticism which 
serves to illuminate the record and give it propor- 
tion. The illustrations, which are " tipped in " on 
different paper from the text and printed frequently 
in the faded color of the original manuscript, are 
remarkably interesting ; they include many repro- 
ductions of autographs from the author's musical 
album, including manuscript music written by 
Wagner, Joachim, Berlioz, Rubinstein, Greig, 
Schumann, and others. On the whole, the make-up 
of the book is in harmony with its interesting con- 
tents.

their peril." This thesis — that " a language grows 
and is not made," that the many speakers, and not 
the few writers, of English, are the coart of last 
resort, not to be moved by the over-academic 
scruples of "pedagogues and pedants," — he dis- 
cusses in many of its implications. He shows how 
slang phrases and new words lose their plebeian 
associations when one realizes that the language is 
a living organism whose rehabilitation by means of 
these very despised neologisms is necessary to its 
literary power and vigor. Then, if the language 
is a race product, the character of " the stock that 
speaks it " becomes a vital matter, and its future in 
England and the United States a legitimate and 
interesting field for speculation. The consideration 
of the linguistic ideals of the English race, whose 
basal motive seems to have been a desire for ef- 
fective simplicity, leads to discussions, first of the 
logical method of naturalizing foreign words, and 
then of the consideration due to the spelling reform 
movement. The ground covered in these essays, 
however familiar to the linguistic expert, will be 
new and inviting to many readers. Particularly 
will teachers of secondary English who have made 
no systematic study of historical English grammar 
find this popular exposition of the principles under- 
lying the science of language of the greatest interest 
and value. 



The life 
and work 
of Wagner. 



In " Richard Wagner : His Life and 
His Dramas" (Putnam) Mr. W. J. 
Henderson has sought " to supply 
Wagner lovers with a single work which shall meet 
all their needs." A glance at the literature of the 
subject already accessible in English will serve to 
place Mr. Henderson's book among its possible 
competitors. First of all, we had the translation of 
Nohl's compact biography. Then came Mr. Finck's 
elaborate two-volume work. More recently, we 
have had the rather slight performance of Mr. 
Lidgey, and an English translation of M. Lavig- 
nac's exhaustive treatise. Of other books about 
Wagner, dealing with parts of his work or aspects 
of his genius, there have been many, but those 
above mentioned are, as far as we can remember, 
the only ones that in any way dispute the field with 
Mr. Henderson. The two brief accounts may be 
dismissed because they are brief; Mr. Finck's work 
is mainly biographical and critical, not supplying 
such analyses as are given by Mr. Henderson ; M. 
Lavignac's work alone has a purpose and a plan 
closely similar to those of the work now under con- 
sideration. We should find it difficult to advise the 
lover of Wagner, restricted to a single book, be- 
tween these two ; we should rather cut the Gordian 
knot by telling him to procure them both. Mr. 
Henderson's work is a treatise of five hundred 
pages, painstaking and scholarly in execution, and 
more temperate in its judgments than are the books 
of most Wagnerian enthusiasts. Bather less than 
half of the contents are given up to biography and 
artistic characterization. The other and larger half 



provides an analytical account of the series of the 
music-dramas, from " Rienzi " to " Parsifal," with 
the sources of their plots, the architectonics of their 
dramatic structure, and the significance of their 
musical themes. The illustrations of the volume 
are a portrait of the composer and a large number 
of illustrative passages in musical notation. The 
'work is highly satisfactory in all respects, and, 
while we cannot say that it supersedes its predeces- 
sors, it certainly supplements them in a way that 
fully justifies its existence.

work on the 



Surely no one can feel, in presenting 
a fresh popular work bearing upon 
French Revolution, ^.^^g French Revolution, that he is 
filling a long-felt want. There must needs be much 
fresh material, or much novelty in treatment, to 
warrant such a production at this time ; and yet we 
find neither the one nor the other in the elementary 
sketch entitled " The Last Days of the French 
Monarchy" (Maemillan), by Miss Sophia H.Mac- 
Lehose. To quote from the preface, the work is 
intended " to enable the reader to approach the 
more important histories with interest and intelli- 
gence." The book's sole title to distinction, in 
competition with the many similar works upon the 
market, is its wealth of illustration. The repro- 
ductions of old cuts and paintings are both inter- 
esting and well done, and together with excellent 
typography and presswork serve to make a very 
pretty book. Probably the author would assert 
also that a service had been rendered in the multi- 
tude of footnotes cited as references to the body of 
the text. In reality, profuse use of footnotes is 
necessary and excusable only in a technical mono- 
graphic work on a new or controverted topic, as in 
a voluminous exhaustive production ; in either of 
which cases, the citations serve as the proof of 
statements made or arguments advanced. The 
lack of any distinctive feature in style, treatment, 
or contents precludes any critical review. In short, 
the book presents the facts ordinarily stated, in the 
manner customary with a score of other works of 
like scope. It closes with 1788 and is preliminary 
to the Revolution itself, which is to be considered 
in a succeeding volume.

ter's criticism is found in the following passage : 

"Sometimes we find ourselves in the middle of plain, 
inofEensive prose without quite knowing how we got there.

THE BlAL

Sometimes there is a sudden descent from lofty heights to 
ignominious depths. Sometimes a momentary plunge into 
the commonplace or the grotesque mars the movement of an 
otherwise beautiful passage. But through all its ups and 
downs the form of Whitman's poetry suits itself admirably 
to the matter, or rather to the spirit. The want of harmony 
and rhythm is quite as much inward as outward. A chaotic 
philosophy — a philosophy which does its best to give back to 
the ' void and formless Infinite all that Time has won from 
it ' — is fitly mirrored in a formless outward form." 

Throughout the essay. Whitman's artistic dualism 
is brought into prominence — "consciously and 
theoretically, he is the poet of democratic equality, 
— and therefore of chaos ; unconsciously, and in 
spite of himself, he is the poet of the ideal." The 
writer believes that " the poet, pure and simple, 
will be remembered and honoured when the socio- 
political prophet has been forgotten, or, if remem- 
bered, has fallen into disesteem." In making his 
selections, which occupy less space than the essay 
itself, Mr. Holmes has sought to give us only the 
best of Whitman. More than half of his pages are 
occupied with the three great pieces : " When lilacs 
last," " Out of the cradle endlessly rocking," and 
the " Passage to India." 



Maurice Hewlett's Nothing but praise awaits the "New 
" New Canterbury Canterbury Tales" (Macmillan) of 
Tales." jyjj. Maurice Hewlett. Alone among 

the writers of the day, perhaps, is he competent to 
add to the work of Chaucer without doing violence 
to the literary convention of that early time. In 
plan and treatment he has followed his original 
closely, assembling his party together under the 
leadership of the Prioress of Ambresbury in the 
royal city of Winchester on Mayday in the year of 
grace 1450, on their way to do pious duty at the 
shrine of St. Thomas i, Becket at Canterbury. They 
were only five days on their journey, in which time 
six tales are told by the miscellaneous company 
under the headship of the noble Prioress, after a 
delightful prologue has introduced a little romance 
of its own by way of providing the necessary links 
between the several stories. The Scrivener of the 
party tells of " The Countess Alys," that good wo- 
man for whom the Order of the Garter was 
founded ; Captain Salomon Brazenhead, veteran of 
Italian wars, discloses the tragic history of " The 
Half-Brothers," drawn from the annals of Venice 
and Milan ; the Prioress herself takes the pathetic 
legend of " St. Gervase of Plessy " from some 
" Lives of the Saints " unknown to others ; Master 
Richard Smith, a shipman of Hull, discourses upon 
" The Cast of the Apple," an episode on the Welsh 
border ; and young Percival Perceforest recounts a 
merry little comedy of errors, styled " Eugenio and 
Galeotto," with its scene alternating between Venice 
and Mantua. All these are in prose, like Chaucer's 
" Parson's Tale " and " The Tale of Meliboeus "; 
and all most successfully avoid the introduction of 
modern thought and feeling, though not modern 
phrasing. Nothing in recent years gives more 
promise of literary permanence than Mr. Hewlett's 
latest book. 



Leaders of ^^ *''^"® '^^^^^ the times is Mr. James 

finance and Bimley's "Millionaires and Kings 

industry. ^f Enterprise " (Lippincott), with 

its fifty or more brisk sketches of leading Amer- 
ican financiers md captains of commerce. The 
English authorsiip of the book lends it an added 
interest to us, aid it must be admitted that full 
justice has been done to the American spirit of 
alertness, energy, and progress. Compiled under 
the auspices of tie Messrs. Harmsworth, the volume 
bears witness to its journalistic origin in the pith 
and point that diaracterize its chapters. All that 
the curious neei to know about Mr. Morgan and 
Mr. Rockefeller and Mr. Carnegie, and half a 
hundred^other " dngs of enterprise " now prominent 
in the public eje, is agreeably set forth in pages 
fairly bristling with figures, usually running up 
into the milliors, preceded by the pound-sterling 
sign. In tastefilness of binding, in wealth of full- 
page portraiture and other illustration, and in ex- 
cellence of papr and print, this cyclopaedia of 
contemporary putocracy almost rises to the dignity 
of literature. 5ven the most unworldly will be 
tempted to lingtr over its wonderful tales of mate- 
rial achievemens. 



Essays by the 
late Dr. Everett 
of Harvard. 



"he late Dean of the Harvard Di- 
•inity School, Dr. C. C. Everett, has 
leen such a power in the world of 
thought during the present generation, that a 
posthumous colection of his writings is sure of a 
cordial receptioi. The twelve " Essays Theological 
and Literary " (Houghton) exhibit a well-defined 
unity, the theological ones being philosophical rather 
than dogmatic, .nd the literary ones being devoted 
to revealing the same spiritual ideas imbedded in 
the poetry of Emerson, Goethe, Tennyson, and 
Browning. Fnm the author's point of view, phil- 
osophy and poery are very much akin. He finds 
in Tennyson an( Browning two of the great spiritual 
forces of our ceitury, presenting together the higher 
life in its f ulnes, doing together what no one singer 
could have accanplished. Emerson is the repre- 
sentative optiaist of the age, behind whom the 
preacher has sh-ewdly entrenched himself ; while 
no literary wok strikes its roots so deep into our 
modern though and life as Goethe's " Faust." The 
keen critical aialysis with which these points are 
developed attes their philosophical as well as literary 

value. 

Jnder the title of " Animals " (H. S. 
Stone & Co.) Mr. Wallace Rice has 
Drepared a popular natural history 
of mammals, — especially such mammals as have 
not been domesicated by man. The book aims to 
give an accurate and succinct survey of the distin- 
guishing characers and habits of those representa- 
tive wild beasti which are more generally known, 
and are often sen in menageries and in zoological 
gardens, or preerved in museums. The descrip- 
tive matter is veil chosen, and affords instructive 
and entertain!^ reading. The presentation ia

Mr, Nigel Oliphant, the author o

the trouble broke out in 1900. The 



contrast to the 



the " Diary of 
(Longmans), is 



a young Scottish o£Bcer who was fiUiig a post in the 

bert Hart when 
book is a manly, 
modest account of the siege as witnetied from the in- 
side of the British Legation. Then is little or no 
attempt at continuous description; ani we are won by 
the simplicity and obvious truth of t e young fellow 
who took his war so gayly, or his gol so seriously, as 
to be laying out a putting ground in th intervals of the 
assaults. The Diary is furnished with desirable maps, 
and is preceded by an appreciative puface from Mr, 
Andrew Lang's pen. 

A *• Time Table of Modern Historyr compiled and 
arranged by Mr. M. Morison, is publiaied by the Mac- 
millan Co., in the form of a large obhag quarto. The 
period covered is from 470 to 1870 — just fourteen 
centuries. It consists, in substance, c' parallel tables 
of events and dates, starting with ss columns, and 
gradually increasing to fourteen or fifuen. At the end 
of the volume are genealogical tables, lists of reigning 
monarchs, a general chart of ancient .nd modern his- 
tory, an elaborate index, and a set i ten historical 
maps of Europe. The work is of a kitd that has been 
done before, but not, to our knowledgi, upon so gener- 
ous a scale. It is indispensable as a btok of reference 
for school libraries. 

The F. A. Bassette Company, Spingfield, Mass., 
have published for Mr. Guy Kirkham,r.A LA., a little 
volume entitled " The Elements oi Architecture," 
taken from the miscellaneous essay; of Sir Henry 
Wottou, Kt. Sir Henry was an amaliur architect of 
the time of Elizabeth, when the amateu architect flour- 
ished and each Lord of the Manor was uore or less the 
architect of his own house. The age ent down to us, 
along with its mass of rare literature, iiany interesting 
and beautiful examples of English do lestic architect- 
ure; and of the former, touching alsoupon the latter, 
these essays of Sir Henry Wotton ar<of no slight in- 
terest. The volume, in type and fom, is a facsimile 
reproduction of the original, which i very rare; and 
our only criticism is that the types, lossibly not too 
clear in the original, suffer in the reprciuction. Wotton 
was a man of attainment, and his prsonality speaks 
through his writings. The style is qui nt and amiable, 
and the matter equally quaint and ttractive to the 
lover and collector of rare specimens. 



Notes. 



" Lessons in Physical Geography," by Mr. Charles 
R. Dyer, is a school text just published by the American 
Book Co. 

" The Cloistering of Ursula " is the title of Mr. Clin- 
ton Scollard's new romance of mediaeval Italy, to be 
issued at once by Messrs. L. C. Page & Co. 

Ruskin's " Sesame and Lilies," edited by Mr. Robert 
Kilburn Root, is a new volume of the " English Read- 
ings," published by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. 

" King Lear," edited by Mr. W. J. Craig, is the 
third volume to appear in the " Dowden Shakespeare," 
now in course of publication by the Bowen-Merrill Co. 

" A Brief Survey of the Life and Writings of Quintus 
Horatius Flaccus," by Professor Sidney G. Ashmore, 
makes a pretty booklet just published by the Grafton 
Press. 

" Wortlehre des Adjektivs im Altsaechsischen," by 
Dr. Edwin Carl Roedder, is a Bulletin of the University 
of Wisconsin in its " Philology and Literature Series," 
of which the first volume is now completed. 

Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. announce for publica- 
tion early in the coming Spring a volume on •♦ Word- 
Coinage " by Mr. Leon Mead. The work is the result 
of several years' special study of the subject on the 
part of its author. 

Professor Albert H. Tol man's school text of Shake- 
speare's "Julius Caesar" is published by the Globe 
School Book Co. It has many rivals, no doubt, but 
none that is more attractive to the student, or more 
scholarly in its execution. 

Mr. Henry Frowde has just published for the Ox- 
ford Clarendon Press, a new edition of the treatise on 
" Milton's Prosody " by Mr. Robert Bridges, supple- 
mented by Mr. William Johnson Stone's essay on 
" Classical Metres in English Verse." 

Messrs. Ginn & Company of Boston announce their 
removal from Tremont Place, where they have been 
for more than twenty-five years past; and are now oc- 
cupying new offices at No. 29 Beacon Street, on the 
site of the historic John Hancock House. 

A study of Charles Heavysege, the Canadian poet 
and dramatist, by Mr. Lawrence J. Burpee, has been 
reprinted in pamphlet form from the " Transactions of 
the Royal Society of Canada." It may be obtained 
from Messrs. J. Hope & Son, Ottawa, or from the 
Copp- Clark Co., Toronto. 

The latest publication of the Early English Text So- 
ciety is an edition, re-edited directly from the manu- 
scripts by Professor George H. McKnight, of the three 
works "King Horn," " Floriz and Blauncheflur," and 
"The Assumption of Our Lady." These poems were 
first edited in 1866 by the Rev. J. Rawson Lumby. 

" Little Pilgrimages among the Women Who Have 
Written Famous Books" (Page), by Messrs. E. F. 
Harkins and C. H. L. Johnston, is a companion to the 
similar volume upon men authors which we recently 
noticed. A score of women are included, all of them 
American by birth or residence, and portraits are given 
us of nearly all of them. 

Dr. A. H. Peirce's " Studies in Auditory and Visual 
Space Perception " (Longmans) forms an excellent ex- 
ample of the kind of monograph which modern Psychol- 
ogy makes possible. It deals in a technical way with 
a special set of problems of interest to experimental 
psychologists, and both gathers together with critical

skill the results of former research upon the subject 
and makes distinctly valuable contributions to the topic. 
It is just this type of work that will gain for experi- 
mental psychology the worthy position among the sci- 
ences which it already enjoys in part. 

*« From Homer to Theocritus," by Professor Edward 
Capps, is a history of the Greek literature of the clas- 
sical period, just published by Messrs. Charles Scribner's 
Sons. Although a revision of an earlier work, the 
changes made are so considerable that the volume is 
one-half larger than before, and now includes a useful 
bibliography and an index. 

"The Three Essentials," by Chancellor Henry 
Mitchell MacCracken, is a baccalaureate sermon given 
at the New York University. The text of the sermon 
was provided by a window of stained glass with three 
panels recently set in the auditorium of the University, 
and the present pamphlet publication (Putnam) repro- 
duces the design in a series of four plates. 

" A Short History of England for School Use," by 
Miss Katharine Coman and Miss Elizabeth Kendall, 
has just been published by the Macmillan Co. It is a 
book for grammar schools, and follows much the same 
lines as the more advanced text-book prepared by the 
same authors about two years ago, although, as is nat- 
ural and proper, more stress is placed upon the personal 
and pictorial elements of the history. 

An interesting experiment in book-publishing is soon 
to be launched in this country and England by Mr. 
Howard Wilford Bell. ««The Unit Library," as the 
venture is designated, will consist of an unlimited col- 
lection of original publications and selected reprints 
from every department of the world's intellectual ac- 
tivity, issued under the editorship of Messrs. William 
Laird Clowes and A. R. Waller. An explanation of the 
title of the series is to be found in the novel method 
under which it will be sold. The price of each volume 
will be regulated by the number of pages it contains, 
a unit of measure being fixed upon. This unit is 25 
pages. The English rate per unit is ^d., or 2d. per 
100 pages. The paper cover will cost Id. in addition 
to the cost of the total number of units, a cloth binding 
will be 5d. additional, or leather binding lOd. addi- 
tional. It is claimed that " The Unit Library " will 
constitute the cheapest series of books ever issued in 
America or England.

It is the only encyclopaedia of United States 
history in existence. 

It is brand new — new in text, new in illus- 
tration, printed from new type cast in 1901 
and never before used. Everything in every 
one of the ten volumes is new. 

It is the complete and authoritative story of 
every event — every historical personage — in 
American history from the earliest times to 
to-day. 

Nearly every great American historian alive 
to-day has assisted as editor or contributor. 

It contains all the epoch-making speeches and 
orations in full. 

It contains original maps, drawings, documents 

— everything that bears on any phase of the 
history of our country. 

It answers every question. It is in itself alone 
a liberal education. The price brings it within 
the reach of every library — private or public 

— in the world.

CHINA IN CONVULSION 

By ARTHUR H. SMITH. Large 8vo, cloth, 2 vols., boxed, $5.00 net. 
" The value of these volumes in depth of research, accuracy of statement, and liberality of conclusion cannot be over 
estimated. The reader need consult no other authority than this to be fully informed upon this most significant crisis." 
— Public Ledger (Philadelphia). 



By ARTHUR H. SMITH 
VILLAGE LIFE IN CHINA. A study in Sociology. 
Fully Illustrated. Sixth thousand. 8vo, cloth, $2.00. 
" Mr. Smith is evidently a man with that rare gift — the gift for 
racial diagnosis. He is able to discriminate between the fundamental 
and the merely superficial differences that exist between Western 
and Chinese civilization. He does not merely describe what is 
behind the curtain; he lifts it, and lets us look in." 

— The Spectator (London). 



By ARTHUR H. SMITH 
CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS. New edition. With 

20 full-page illustrations and index, and characteristic 

decoration for each chapter. 8vo, cloth, $2 00. 

"The best book on the Chinese people." — The Examiner. 

" A completely trustworthy study." — The Advance. 

" It is scarcely enough to say about this book that it is both 
interesting and valuable. Those best informed call it without 
exception the best book on the Chinese that is before the public, and a 
pretty careful survey of it confirms that opinion. " — The Independent. 



ARABIA: THE CRADLE OF ISLAM. Studies in 
Geography, People, and Politics of the Peninsula ; with 
an account of Islam and Missionary Work. By Rev. 
S. M. ZwEMER, F.K.G.S. With maps and numerous 
illustrations from Drawings and Photographs. 8vo, 
cloth, S2.00. 

" One of many notable instances in which missionary explorers 
have laid the civilized world under obligations of gratitude for 
contributions to general knowledge of the world. Students of 
international problems will find interest in the account here given of 
political conditions under the control of England in Arabia — a most 
beneficent influence, according to the testimony of the Arabs them- 
selves. The author has availed himself of the most recent author- 
ities in supplementing his personal observation." — The Outlook. 



KOREA AND HER NEIGHBORS. By Isabella 
L. Bishop, F.R.Q.S. Illustrated from Original Photo- 
graphs. 8vo, cloth, $2.00. 

" Mrs. Bishop is a model traveler, intelligent, observing, unpre- 
judiced, patient, and untiring. Add to this the experience which 
comes from years of travel in the East, her eminent fitness to travel 
through such a country as Korea, and write a book about it is 
apparent. To the general reader the book can be commended as a 
timely and interesting book of travel, and to the Christian student 
the observations and conclusions respecting the missionary work 
will have more than a passing interest." — New York Observer. 



JERUSALEM THE HOLY. By 

Hon. Edwin S. Wallace. With 
Maps and Diagrams drawn especi- 
ally for this work by Archibald 
Dickie, of the Palestine Explora- 
tion Society; and other illustra- 
tions. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 
" A careful reading of this book will give 
one as clear an idea of Jerusalem of to-day 
as he can get in any way without visiting 
the place. He will feel that he has walked 
the streets, and looked into the shops and 
homes, and seen the inhabitants in their 
homes, and marked the contrast between 
Jew and Christian and Moslem ; lingered 
about the holy places, burrowed under- 
ground to trace old walls and foundations, 
and studied the missions of the various 
Christian Sects." — The Congregationalist. 



THE HOLY LAND 

THE LAND OF ISRAEL. By 

P«OF. Robert L. Stewart. D.D. 
A Text book of the Physical and 
Historical Geography of the Holy 
Land, Embodying the Results of 
Recent Research. Illustrated, with 
Maps. 12mo, cloth. $1.50. 
"An up-to-date book, admirably written, 
disclosing a personal warmth, enthusiasm, and 
realism, begotten by travel and close observa- 
tion of the Holy Land. The maps are a special 
feature, showing all places of historic interest, 
indicating also the routes of railways in Pal- 
estine, and the old roads worn into the rocks 
by the tread of generations. The several sub- 
jects suggested are presented in an attractive 
style, with a fullness, clearness, and force 
which make it a delight to linger among its 
instructive pages."

" We have seen nothing quite so good in

" We are acquainted with no other work 
that combines the attractive features of Mr. 
MacCoun's compact little volumes." — The 
Rtview of Bf views. 



THE CHINAMAN AS WE SEE HIM. Fifty Years 
of Work for Him. By Ira M, Condit, D.D. Fully 
illustrated. 12rao, cloth, $1.50. 

The book deals entirely with the Chinese in America, the author's 
opportunities for observation being exceptional, inasmuch as he has 
worked among the inhabitants of the populous " Chinatown " of San 
Francisco for the past forty years or more. This will prove to be 
the book on the Mongol in America. 



THE PILGRIM FATHERS OF NEW ENGLAND,

"Of China's Intellectual Life no one has more qualifications to write than the President of the Chinese Imperial

"Ex-President Martin is well qualified by long residence and un-

to tell us of the real life and thought of China." — Congregationalisl.

THE SIEGE IN PEKING. China Against the 

World. Illustrated. $1.00. 

" With the awful scenes fresh and vivid in his memory. Dr. Martin 
has written with graphic pen the story of one of the most dramatic 
incidents of modern times. The book goes far beyond a mere narra- 
tive of striking incidents. It has the special virtue of coming from 
the man who is easily the expert and the highest authority in the 
matters Chinese." — Homiletic Review.

" Supplies a positive want, inasmuch as nothing has yet appeared 
covering the field with such intimate knowledge. The author's words

of service as a missionary in Mexico." — The Outlook. 



CULTURE AND RESTRAINT. By Hugh Black. 

8vo, decorated, gilt top, $1.50 net. 

" Mr. Black's exposition is admirable for its clearness and com- 
prehensiveness and for the scholarly familiarity with the best philo- 
sophical thought which it displays." — Public Opinion. 

"Like his well-known book on 'Friendship,' his new work on 
• Culture and Restraint ' is characterized by dignity of style, earnest- 
ness of purpose, and many evidences both of large-mindedness and 
of wide reading." — The Book-lover's Weekly. 



WITH THE TIBETANS IN TENT AND TEMPLE. 
The Narrative of Events of a Journey into the 
Closed Land. By Susie C. Rijnhart, M.D. Fully 
illustrated from original drawings and photographs never 
before published. 12mo, decorated cloth, $1.50. 
The Tibetans are a strange people. About them and their country 
little is known. The fragmentary and superficial accounts of scenes 
and incidents in this Great Closed Land that those who have trav- 
ersed the country have prepared, are far from being the proper 
interpretation. Hence it is that "With the Tibetans in Tent and 
Temple," by Dr. Susie C. Rijnhart, comes as a genuine contribution 
to the literature of travel.

A HISTORY OF AMERICAN 
VERSE 

By James L. Onderdonk. 12mo, pp. 395, $1.25 net. 
Mr. Howells, in reviewing this book for the North

temperance with which the author has done his 
work . . . He begins with our beginnings, and he 
ends with our endings. . . . He shows himself a 
connoisseur of poetry. . . . All his criticisms are 
based upon reasons which he gives, and upon grounds 
which he proves solid."

Announcement of interest to librarians 

A. C. McCLURG & CO. desire to call the attention of librarians to the 
following interesting information about some of their Spring books. The list 
includes a number of works that will be of immediate importance, as for 
example the two books on Nicaragua — *' Ocean to Ocean," a personal and 
descriptive narrative by J. W. G. Walker, U. S. N., of a surveying trip across 
Nicaragua, and a new edition of Sheldon's " Notes on the Nicaragua Canal." 
Lieutenant Walker is the son of Rear Admiral Walker, and participated in 
the survey of 1898, and Mr. Sheldon is a business man who has given years 
to the investigation of the advantages offered over the Panama Canal by 
the proposed Nicaragua route. Both books will be illustrated. A new edi- 
tion, with new introduction and new illustrations, of Reuben G. Thwaites's 
'^ Down Historic Waterways," will be of especial interest to librarians. 
Among volumes of literary interest will be "Letters to an Enthusiast," 
by Mary Cowden Clarke, being a chapter in the life of the famous Shake- 
spearean scholar; a selection of essays by the well-known literary critic, 
WilHam Morton Payne ; a new edition of Baldwin's " Book Lover," entirely 
re-written and re-printed from new plates; a "Selection of the World's 
Greatest Short Stories," by Sherwin Cody; "Right Reading," quotations 
from ten famous authors on the choice and use of books, beautifully printed 
at the Merrymount Press ; and a new selection from the " Meditations " of 
Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, made by Walter Lee Brown.

THE BATTLEGROUND. By Ellen Glasgow. 
A simply charming story of Virginia life in war time

mischievous eyes have worked madness upon so many. 
" The man who came often " is an object of extreme

and the Spanish Main — of love and adventure — of 
stern Puritans and of buoyant youth in Massachusetts 
Bay Colony. ($1.50.) 

BELSHAZZAR. By Wm. Stearns Davis. The

AN INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY OF 
ENGLISH POETRY. By Mark H. Liddell.

THE BROOK BOOK. By Mary Rogers Miller. 
The author, well-known as connected with the Nature

TfflJ NOVEL A ND T HE LIBRARY. 

The great preponderance of works of fiction 
among the books drawn from public libraries 
has always been a subject of much concern to 
librarians and other men engaged in the busi- 
ness of public education. It comes up for 
discussion perennially, and various are the sug- 
gestions made for the correction of what is 
generally recognized as an evil. While there 
is nothing to say against the practice of reading 
fiction, abstractly considered, there is much to 
say against the novel-reading habit which seems 
to be fastened upon the majority of those who 
use our public libraries. When the statistics of 
circulation show that works of fiction constitute 
from fifty to eighty per cent of the books that 
are taken for home reading, there is certainly 
some reason to think that the library is regarded 
as a source of entertainment rather than of 
public education, and some reason to question 
the wisdom of taxing the people at large for 
such a purpose. Even if careful consideration 
of the whole subject convinces us that a library, 
put chiefly to such uses, is better than no library 
at all, and still on the whole a worthy object 
of public support, it is certainly obligatory 
upon those who control the supply of free 
books to use all possible vigilance in minimizing 
the evil of thoughtless reading, and in encour- 
aging the literary and studious tastes of readers. 

Very often the statistics themselves disguise 
the evil which they cannot wholly conceal. A 
library which reports sixty per cent of fiction 
among the books circulated will very likely 
report also from ten to fifteen per cent of juve- 
nile literature (most of which is fiction), and 
from five to ten per cent of books in foreign 
languages, of which novels form the larger 
fraction. Some librarians regard this condition 
of affairs with complacency, and, while seizing 
every opportunity that is offered to encourage 
the reading of serious books, still hold to the 
view which was advocated by the late W. F. 
Poole — the view that most of these novel- 
readers would read nothing at all unless they 
could get what they wanted, and that it is well 
for them to acquire the reading habit even if 
a wiser judgment disapproves of their habitual 
selection of books. There is much to be said 
for this view, and for its corollary that the 



74 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



exercise of the reading habit in any form tends 
to bring about a gradual elevation of literary 
taste, especially if the reader be supplied all 
along with gentle and unobtrusive incitements 
to the acquisition of better standards and 
broader interests. This sort of stimulus has 
to be applied tactfully, and it is a distinctive 
characteristic of the good librarian that he 
knows how to apply it with judgment and with- 
out ruffling the reader's temper. The natural 
man, who has outgrown the years of tutelage, 
resents being practised upon by others for his 
own good, and, although he may be led to the 
water, he must be left to believe that he is 
drinking it of his own volition. 

The subject of fiction in the public library 
has recently come up for renewed discussion 
in connection with a report from Springfield, 
Massachusetts, according to which the librarian, 
during the past four years, has reduced the 
circulation of fiction by about one-fourth. This 
may not seem strange news to the general 
reader, but to those who know anything of 
library work from its professional side, the 
report is so startling that it seems almost sen- 
sational. One librarian says it is what Lord 
Dundreary would have called a " staggerer." 
Experience shows the percentage of fiction to 
be so nearly uniform from year to year that a 
change of as little as five per cent would excite 
comment. Naturally, then, a change (and for 
the better) of something like five times that 
percentage is a cause for both surprise and 
curious interest. By just what means so great 
a reduction of novel-reading has been brought 
about we do not know, but so gratifying a result 
is sure to excite the spirits of both inquiry and 
emulation in the breasts of librarians all over 
the country. 

There are many devices of the obvious sort 
for the lowering of the percentage of fiction 
and the raising of the percentage of serious, 
reading, and these have been used by all good 
librarians in the United States during the 
quarter-century that librarianship has been rec- 
ognized as one of the professions. They in- 
clude such things as the limited supplying of 
novels and the liberal supplying of better books, 
the publication of annotated and descriptive 
lists upon special subjects, the coiSperation of 
librarians with teachers in the work of the 
schools, the opening of the library shelves to 
easy access on the part of the public, and the 
judicious use of personal counsel on the subject 
of reading. But there seems to be a rather 
narrow limit to the efficacy of any of these de- 



vices, or of all of them together ; if they have 
proved adequate to effect the reduction reported 
from Springfield, the case is as surprising as 
it is exceptional, and few librarians will be 
hopeful of accomplishing similar results by 
such means. What we wish now to consider 
are certain methods of a farther-reaching and 
more radical sort that have either been put inta 
operation of late years here and there, or that 
have been suggested by the recent revival of 
interest in the discussion. The " Saturday 
Review " of the New York " Times " not long^ 
ago invited professional opinions upon this sub- 
ject, and elicited several suggestions that are 
deserving of serious consideration. 

Mr. Herbert Putnam, who by virtue of his 
official position is the leader of the profession 
of librarianship in America, makes a sugges- 
tion that may be pronounced radical, but that 
commends itself to the sober intelligence after 
the first shock of surprise is over. It is, 
simply, that no works of fiction be purchased 
by public libraries for at least a year after 
publication. Nothing could be more sensible 
than the following words : 

" There is, however, a demand for fiction which I do 
not believe can legitimately be met by the public 
library. That is the demand for the latest new novel 
merely because it is the latest new novel. We all 
read current novels also and enjoy and profit by them. 
But the demand for them is largely artificial, for a pur- 
pose merely social, and it is apt to be transitory. No 
free library can meet it adequately, and the attempt to 
meet it is an expense and annoyance to the reader and 
expense and burden to itself." 

The exclusion of the newest fiction from the 
library shelves would doubtless occasion a great 
outcry, but the loss to the public would be 
more imaginary than real. Every librarian 
knows how hollow is the pretence of meeting 
the popular demand for the novels of the day. 
To supply that demand would entail an ex- 
penditure that no librarian could sanction. 
Take such a novel, for example, as " The 
Crisis," and such a library, for example, as that 
of Chicago. Probably five hundred people 
were daily clamoring for that particular novel 
during the weeks that immediately followed 
its publication. To satisfy them, it would 
have been necessary to purchase several thou- 
sands of copies, with the absolute certainty 
that next year they would be collecting dust 
upon the shelves, if not actually consigned to 
the lumber-room. The satisfaction of an ephem- 
eral fancy of this sort is an absolutely illegiti- 
mate demand to make upon any public library. 
The only library that has a right to spend 



1902.] 



THE DIAL 



76 



money in this reckless fashion is the private 
enterprise of the Mudie type, which exists for 
the special purpose of catering to the taste of 
the moment. What such a library as the 
Chicago institution actually does in the case of 
a novel like "The Crisis " is to purchase forty 
or fifty copies of the work, and supply one 
applicant out of every two or three hundred. 
"In proposing to supply such a novel," says 
Mr. Putnam, " the library deludes the public 
and reduces its capacity for service really 
serviceable." It does not really supply the 
demand, and succeeds only in gratifying an 
occasional applicant at the cost of creating ex- 
asperation in the breasts of the thousands who, 
knowing that the book is in the library, ask 
for it from day to day until they desist from 
sheer weariness. 

We are inclined to think, on the whole, that 
every public library would be well-advised in 
adopting Mr. Putnam's suggestion, thus forc- 
ing its patrons to take, as far as the library 
is concerned, Emerson's well-known advice 
against reading books that have not kept alive 
for at least a year. Using " The Crisis " once 
more for our illustration, it is safe to say that 
by next summer the demand for that excellent 
story will have fallen to normal proportions. 
It will still be asked for by a few people, and 
it will be as proper to provide copies to be read 
as it is proper to provide copies of "The 
Spy." This, of course, presents an extreme 
case, for, besides the two or three novels that 
a capricious public marks for its favor every 
season, there are two or three hundred others 
of merit sufficient to entitle their claims to be 
recognized. But the reasoning to be employed 
is similar in all the cases ; the demand for cur- 
rent fiction is essentially temporary and artifi- 
cial, and it is doubtful if it be the policy of 
wisdom to put into a public library any books 
for which there may not be some reasonable 
demand year after year. 

The librarian who is unwilling to make him- 
self disliked by refusing to supply the public 
with current novels may find a sort of way out 
of the difficulty by adopting a plan which has 
already been successfully operated in a few 
places. This is the plan of opening a special 
department of new fiction, buying enough books 
to meet the demand, and making a small charge 
for their use. The doctrinaire objection that 
all the services of a public library must be free 
may be met by stating the obvious fact that 
this particular service is impossible unless it be 
made self-supporting. The fee might be a very 



small one — much less than that charged by 
the private libraries — and yet sufficient to 
make the books thus circulated pay for them- 
selves. The average novel costs the library 
rather less than one dollar ; it may be in con- 
stant use for a year or more before it is worn 
out ; if it is made to bring in two cents a week 
during that year, the transaction will be fair 
to all parties — no appreciable burden, cer- 
tainly, upon the reader, and no burden upon 
the budget except on the score of library service. 
At the end of the book's career, it will have 
provided entertainment for possibly fifty fam- 
ilies, at practically no cost to the library ; it will 
have paid for itself, and may be thrown away 
with a good conscience. If the public library 
is, in any real sense, to provide its patrons with 
the latest novels, we believe that this is the 
only legitimate way of doing it. But we are 
sufficiently tainted with the educational theory 
of the library to think Mr. Putnam's plan, 
after all, the one better deserving to be pursued. 
The two suggestions thus considered are the 
only ones that go to the root of the matter. 
Other suggestions are of the nature of ingenious 
devices or persuasive methods. One of the 
best of them is the two-card system which gives 
every card-holder the right to draw two books 
at the same time, only one of which may be a 
work of fiction. This encourages collateral 
reading of the serious kind, and is said to secure 
good results. Practical librarians are now gen- 
erally learning how much good may be done 
by such things as open shelves, special bib- 
liographies of timely interest, talks with teachers 
and school children, object-lessons in model 
collections of standard literature, the encour- 
agement of clubs and study-classes, and the 
judicious selection of the fiction that is provided 
for circulation. These means are all praise- 
worthy, and are, in their aggregate employment, 
productive of marked benefit. And, in all this 
discussion, it must not be forgotten that the 
reading of good fiction is something more than 
entertainment, that it is a study of one of the 
great forms of creative literature, and one of 
the most potent agencies whereby the sym- 
pathies may be quickened, the horizon enlarged, 
the higher interests aroused, and culture at- 
tained. We have forever passed the day when 
thoughtful people could condemn the reading 
of fiction as such ; we have come to understand 
for good that the best novels are among the 
best books there are, however we may deprecate 
the reading of the shallow and sensational sorts 
of fiction.

THE PUBLIC LIBRARY: 
ITS PURPOSES AND POSSIBILITIES. 



Those who are working for popular education 
and the betterment of social condkions are again 
indebted to the Commissioner of Education, who 
includes in his last annual report a chapter devoted 
to the statistics of public libraries in the United 
States. The rapid and greatly accelerating growth 
which is shown to have taken place since the report 
of five years ago, in the number _ of libraries 
reporting, the number of volumes which have been 
added, and the work the libraries are accomplish- 
ing, comes as a surprise even to those who have 
been most interested in watching the development 
of the library movement. 

In view of this evidence of material prosperity, 
and the prominence which has in the past few years 
been given to the public library, it may not be 
unprofitable for us to consider what the public 
library of the present day stands for ; what is its 
aim and purpose ; what the place it holds in the 
<;ivic life of this day, that cities should so readily 
assume its support ; what the meaning of the oppor- 
tunity it holds which makes it appeal so forcefully to 
the philanthro])i8t, not only as a means of enriching 
the daily life of the people, but of giving to the stu- 
■dent the means of making individual research, by 
furnishing the rare and costly collections which are 
necessary for such work ; in short, to consider to 
what the public library has already attained, and 
to discover, if we can, to what larger things the 
spirit which has been moving so mightily in these 
latter days may be leading us. 

The function of the public library is to supply 
books, for purposes of both entertainment and 
information, to its readers. It aims to supply the 
best books to the largest number. It seeks not 
only to supply the needs of the individual reader, 
but to supplement all other educational forces of 
the city and to aid any eJSort which is made for its 
good. In its educational work, the city library of 
to-day parallels the schools, from the kindergarten 
to the university, and goes beyond the latter in its 
-services to the advanced student and investigator. 
The children's rooms in our libraries know 
no age limit, and welcome the youngest children 
that are able to use books, or even to enjoy pic- 
tures; showing them that a book may be to them 
a source of delight, rather than a task, and solicit- 
ing their interest in its proper care and handling. 
Each important subject, as history, • biography, 
travel, science, poetry, and even political science, 
ethics, and religion, is represented by books suitable 
for younger readers ; and this collection is cata- 
logued, classified, numbered, and arranged in a 
manner similar to that of the main collection. If 
in addition to this, as is often the case, the holders 
of juvenile membership cards are allowed to use 
the main collection, when the time arrives that 
(their membership is transferred to the general cir- 



culating department, they are not coming upon 
unknown ground, but are entering a territory with 
which they may have already made themselves 
acquainted, and in which they will find familiar 
landmarks and guides. The curricula of the public 
schools are carefully studied, and books which will 
aid the pupil in enlarging the subject, broadening 
his horizon, and deepening his interest, are plenti- 
fully supplied, — the books recommended for col- 
lateral reading being, of course, included in the 
number. 

The education of the individual in the schools 
and beyond, is comprised in three periods, as fol- 
lows : 

First: That of acquisition alone, in which the text 
books are descriptive, little more than statements of 
fact, and the work mainly that of memory. 

Second : That of comparison, in which truths and 
facts are placed in relation to each other and inter- 
preted ; the work of the reason and of judgment. 
The two are not separated by a definite line, the 
work of acquiring knowledge going on still in the 
second stage. 

Third : That of investigation and original re- 
search, whether under the auspices of an institution, 
or independently. In this the student uses the 
knowledge already acquired as stepping-stones to 
discovery in realms still unknown. 

In the first stage the library is of value by 
broadening and presenting in a more attractive 
way the facts of the text books. As the pupil 
passes gradually into the second stage, of compari- 
son and interpretation, the value of the library 
becomes greater, and its use essential to any full 
understanding of the relations of the subjects under 
consideration. For work in the third stage the 
library, the storehouse of all human knowledge, is 
indispensable. He who would reach out and pluck 
treasures from the unknown in any field, must first 
master and plant himself firmly upon that which is 
known. Dr. Oilman, in describing the function of 
a university in conserving knowledge and promot- 
ing investigation, has happily said that " Libraries 
and museums are the dwelling places of univer- 
sities." 

While the library is thus the handmaid and 
helper of the school throughout the entire course, 
and is the workshop of the advanced student, the 
investigator and explorer, it has a function of even 
greater importance for those whose opportunities 
for education do not go beyond the public schools, 
and a function which no other institution can so well 
perform ; that is, to continue the education for good 
citizenship that is begun in the public schools. To 
the large number, — to the great majority of our 
boys and girls, — who leave school at the age of 
fourteen or fifteen, when they are just ready to 
enter the high school, whose work in school has 
been largely that of learning the art of reading and 
of storing their memories with elementary knowl- 
edge, whose work has been almost entirely in the 
first stage of education, — to these the public

library must be high school, college, university ; it 
must give to them the only opportunity they are 
likely to have of broadening and increasing their 
knowledge, of properly relating and interpreting 
the facts of nature and of life, and making their 
knowledge a consistent whole instead of a mere 
collection of isolated facts. This is an additional 
and still more weighty reason for training children 
in the use of the library from their earliest school- 
days ; as, in addition to its immediate advantage 
in their school work, it will make them acquainted 
with that institution which must be their main reli- 
ance in continuing their education beyond the 
period of their school life ; and having once tested 
its usefulness in answering the questions of the 
schoolroom, they will more readily turn to it for 
assistance when confronted by the larger problems 
of life. 

The library is in touch with every phase and 
interest of human life, and may be helpful in all. 
To the man or woman who is merely breadwinner 
or homemaker, it offers practical suggestion and 
helpful information from its store of books on the 
various arts and handicrafts. In addition to the 
many books on practical matters which are of gen- 
eral interest and in demand always and every- 
where, every library should consider the business 
interests peculiar to its location, — as shipbuilding, 
manufactures, mining, agriculture, — and should 
provide itself with the best literature upon these 
subjects, to the great practical benefit of those 
engaged in these occupations. It is a fact that 
certain towns in this country which have good 
technical libraries have attained preeminence in 
certain manufacturing industries, largely due, I 
believe, to the fact that the library had quietly, 
year after year, supplied to the workman the best 
books upon his special work, and thus enabled him 
to come to his daily task with more exact informa- 
tion and with greater intelligence ; and in this way 
the libraries have yielded to their cities direct finan- 
cial returns for the outlay. It is a fact also, to 
which the records of public libraries generally will 
bear witness, that books on house-building, home- 
making, the care of children and of the sick, the 
household arts and elegancies, are in large and con- 
stant demand ; and while it is not possible to 
measure the results of their use, it is fair to assume 
that they are doing a great deal toward the making 
of more comfortable and happy homes. The ten- 
dency of the reading habit is toward economy and 
thrift. A taste for books restrains from unprofit- 
able, expensive, and harmful amusements, and 
arouses interest in the things that are better worth 
while. The reading of books for entertainment 
merely, within reasonable bounds, is a pleasure 
which is followed by no disagreeable recollections. 
The library is not only a direct aid in the arts 
of life to the individual, but is also helpful in public 
affairs. The pedagogical department of a city 
library is the library of city school teachers, and 
their use of it renders it exceedingly valuable to the 



work of the schools. That department which deals 
with public questions — such as highways, sewers, 
lighting, car service, police, sanitary and fire pro- 
tection — is a practical library of information for 
the municipal authorities upon subjects that are of 
the greatest importance to the welfare of the city ; 
and also gives to the private citizen an opportunity 
to form an opinion as to the conduct of city affairs. 
Indeed, there is no phase of the work of the library 
which is of such importance as that of affording to 
all of our citizens, and to the boys and girls who 
are preparing for citizenship, an opportunity to fit 
themselves for their civic duties. An American 
citizen is called upon to express, at the voting booth 
and elsewhere, an opinion not only upon municipal 
questions of vital importance, but, in the wider 
realm of state and national politics, he must decide 
upon questions of foreign policy, upon great eco- 
nomic problems upon which the prosperity of the 
country largely depends, which are complex and 
diflficult and should have careful study. The de- 
partments of sociology and history should be of 
great value to the thoughtful citizen. While the 
public library cannot lend itself to the propaganda 
of any particular school of opinion, it is the arena 
into which all opinions worthy of consideration may 
enter with the assurance of fair presentation. The 
public library has already become an important 
factor in the political education of our citizens, and 
there are wonderful possibilities for greater devel- 
opment along this same line. 

Thus far I have only spoken of the economic and 
social value of the library, as an aid to the citizen 
and the city in material interest and in civic duties. 
But beyond this is its use in the enlarging, the up- 
lifting, the sweetening of the individual life. I need 
not argue this ; we all recognize the value of good 
books to the human soul, — of the opportunity they 
give us of communion with the masters, of realizing 
the permanent, the eternal, the worthy. Words- 
worth has said : 

" There is 
One great society on earth, 
The uoble living and the noble dead." 

It is not given to many of us to commune familiarly 
in the flesh with those who are recognized as standing 
preeminently above their fellows ; but we may from 
the shelves of our library choose at will our intimate 
companions from the greatest and noblest of all 
time, and we may in the solitude of our own rooms 
commune with them as with familiar friends. A 
great man once said : 

" But when evening falls I go home and enter my 
study. On the threshold I lay aside my country gar- 
ments, soiled with mire, and array myself in courtly 
garb. Thus attired I make my entrance into the an- 
cient courts of the men of old, where they receive me 
with love, and where I feed upon the food which only 
is my own and for which I was born. For four hours' 
space I feel no annoyance, forget all care; poverty can 
not frighten, nor death appal me." 

This realm is the heritage of us all ; but for many

of us, for most of us, indeed, the only way of ap- 
proach lies through the open alcoves of the public 
library. 

So far as the public library lies parallel to the 
primary and secondary work in our schools, it re- 
ceives its support in the same way and for the same 
reason ; namely, that it is educating the younger 
generation for the duties of citizenship. The same 
claim may fairly be made for all library work, on 
the ground that whatever helps a man to do his 
work more ably and honestly, and to earn a better 
living for his family, — whatever enables a woman 
to make a home in which grace and comfort and 
elegance shall be more abundant, — and whatever 
instructs them both as to their social relations and 
civic duties, is beneficial to the State. And the 
same may be said with almost equal truth of the 
range of library work which is general and popular ; 
for whatever makes a man better informed, broader 
in his views, and contributes to his happiness and 
contentment, will tend to make him a better citizen. 
The city which spends thirty dollars a year on the 
elementary education of each of its school children 
can well afford to spend one dollar per year for each 
in support of a library to enable them to continue 
their education. 

It is only when we come to that higher range of 
library work which meets the needs of advanced 
students and original investigators, which involves 
the purchase of expensive collections to be used by 
comparatively few people, that a practical question 
arises as to how far the municipal tax-supported 
library should go. I said a practical question, for 
there can hardly be a doubt as to the right of pro- 
viding for higher education at public expense. We 
have in its favor the authoritative opinion of the 
fathers of the Republic, and of some of its greatest 
statesmen, from Washington to Edward Everett. 
We have precedent in the great state universities, 
which, under the fostering care of the state and by 
its support, are doing a wonderful educational work. 
But with the municipality it is not a question of 
theoretical right, but of ways and means. Our city 
libraries are usually supported by taxation, and re- 
ceive only a small fraction of the amount levied for 
municipal purposes. In one city with whose work 
I am familiar, and which received rather a larger 
part of the levy than in most cities, this proportion 
of the municipal levy devoted to the library is about 
one and one-half per cent of the whole. This pro- 
portion seems small ; but in the great pressure for 
improvements which are essential to the growth of 
the city, and for protection, and with a burden of 
taxation already heavy, it is not easy to see how 
any considerable increase can fairly be made in the 
levy for library purposes. This is the condition in 
most of our rapidly growing cities. And in most 
of them the demand for books to be used in con- 
nection with the school work, or of immediate value 
along the other lines I have indicated, is much 
greater than can be met. In this condition it is 
difficult for the public library to devote any con- 



siderable part of its funds to the purchase of book& 
for the use of advanced students ; although it may 
recognize clearly the value of such work, and may 
see that it does ultimately yield benefits to the 
community. 

The need of adequate housing for libraries, of 
buildings which shall be convenient and dignified and 
beautiful, and which shall be built amply enough 
to supply the wants of future generations, is being 
met by state and municipal appropriations and by 
magnificent private gifts. During the year ending- 
July 1, 1901, about $19,000,000 was given to the 
libraries of the United States, of which sum th& 
larger part was given expressly for the erection of 
buildings. With this want supplied comes the need 
of larger collections of books ; a need which, when 
it is fully understood, we may hope to see met by 
endowments for the definite purpose of supplying 
book funds. The building logically comes first j 
for, unless a library has a home which is commo- 
dious and convenient and reasonably secure from 
loss by fire, it cannot hope for any considerable ad- 
dition to its collections by gifts. If it is fortunate 
enough to have a building which is not only ampla 
and safe, but beautiful and dignified, its attraction 
for the donor is still greater. After the building 
is supplied, the most urgent need is for more books,, 
for larger collections, both for the special student 
and for popular use. The noble gifts which have 
been made within the past few years give us reason to 
hope that when these needs of the library are under- 
stood, they will be met in the same generous way. 

A study of the reports of our city libraries from 
year to year shows that the collections are not being 
increased as largely as is necessary to do the work 
which should be done, owing to lack of funds ; and 
the testimony of librarians in public libraries gen- 
erally will be that the demands upon their libra- 
ries are much greater than they can meet. An ad- 
equate supply of books is of no less importance than 
a noble building. And this is a perennial need ; 
it cannot be met sufficiently by a single gift, but 
rather by vested funds which shall provide for ad- 
ditions regularly from year to year. Side by side 
with the name of him who provided the building 
will be the name of him who endows the institution 
with ample book funds, and thus continuously and 
cumulatively increases its educational power, its 
influence for social betterment, for generation after 
generation of readers in all the years to come.

WHAT THE CARNEGIE INSTITUTION COULD DO 

FOR LIBRARIANSHIP AND BIBLIOGRAPHY. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

There are three undertakings in the interest of schol- 
arly users of libraries, and in the interest of librarians 
themselves, which seem to come directly within the 
scope of the Carnegie Institution. 

The first of these is the establishment of a lending 
library for libraries, to consist of serial publications 
and other large and expensive works that an average 
library, and even a library of more than average size, 
could not obtain, but which might be needed in research 
work by some of its constituents. This would seem, 
in a way, to conflict with the expressed intention of the 
Librarian of Congress to do this very thing. But, for 
one thing, the claims on the Library of Congress in 
this respect would be very numerous, and would very 
often come from persons who would not use the books 
for purposes of pure research; further, there would be 
a not inconsiderable number of publications that the 
Library of Congress could not, for one reason or another, 
procure, but which the Carnegie Institution might re- 
gard as its duty to supply. 

The greatest burden on the modern scientific inves- 
tigator is the necessity of working out the bibliography 
of the subject on which he is to engage. It consumes 
valuable time that he could use to better purpose, and 
the bibliography which he ultimately does procure is 
■usually of very inferior workmanship, for the reason 
that few scientific specialists are trained bibliographers. 
If the Carnegie Institution would establish a biblio- 
graphical department where the investigator could 
have his bibliographical material collected for him, it 
would be a great boon. Of course such a department 
would necessarily have among its officers and assistants 
men of scientific training, so that each topic could be 
•assigned to a man who in some measure would combine 
the attainments of the bibliographer and the scientific 
specialist. The department should also engage on its 
own account in the preparation of special bibliographies 
which might be found to be particularly needed. By 
a judicious use of electrotypes and printed cards, dupli- 
cation of work could be avoided, and every entry once 
made would serve all future purposes. 

It would be particularly useful to the library world 
if the Carnegie Institution would offer facilities for 
post-graduate study of bibliography and library admin- 
istration. There is at present no place in this country 
where the would-be librarian or bibliographer can fit 
himself, beyond an elementary stage, for his life work. 
The subjects of study which one wishing to prepare 
himself for bibliographical or library work would pursue 
are: 1, The literature of bibliography and librarianship; 

2, The use and handling of books as literary tools; 

3, Bibliographical methodology (i. e., methods of com- 
pilation and recording); 4, Comparative history of lit- 
erature and science; 5, Classification of knowledge and 
of books; 6, History of libraries and library adminis- 
tration; 7, History of writing and printing, including 
the study of the methods of the mediaeval scribes and 
the early printers.

Tjibrary Fixtures, Axcient and 
Mbdi^val,.* 



A few years ago the Registrar of Cambridge 
University, on being invited to deliver the 
Rede Lecture before that university, chose as 
his subject, " Libraries in the Mediaeval and 
Renaissance Periods." The lecture was pub- 
lished and is doubtless familiar to many libra- 
rians. A much more elaborate and compre- 
hensive work on the same general theme is 
now issued by the same writer. Not since the 
appearance of Gottlieb's " Mittelalterliche 
Bibliotheken " has there been offered to those 
interested in library history a book of equal 
importance in this special department. Indeed, 
in choosing his somewhat restricted province 
of research, the author has entered a field com- 
paratively free from competitors, and his work 
has the merit of novelty to add to its more 
substantial excellences. 

First to be treated is the library (or record- 
rooms) in the palace of Assur-bani-pal (Sar- 
danapalus) at Nineveh, discovered by Layard 
in 1850. We are told that the books, or tab- 
lets, were devoted to history, law, science, 
magic, dogma, legend ; that there was a special 
officer to take care of them ; that they were 
arranged in series, with precautions for keeping 
the tablets of each series in their proper se- 
quence ; and that there was a general catalogue, 
and probably a class catalogue as well. This 
information is meagre, but interesting. Why, 
one is tempted to query, did not Mr. Clark go 
back to the older Babylonian libraries for a 
beginning? Of Sargon's library, at Agane, 
we know at least something. Its catalogue 
has been unearthed and shows that each tablet 
was numbered, so as to be called for by number 
rather than by title. Egyptian libraries do not 
detain our author long, nor does he so much 
as mention the library of King Osymaudyas 
(Rameses I.) in the Ramesseum near Thebes, 
of which Diodorus Siculus tells us that it bore 
the apt inscription, " Dispensary of the Soul." 
Of the libraries at Alexandria — for there 
were two — next to nothing is known as to their 
housing and arrangement ; so the writer passes 
on to Pergamon, and then to Greece and Rome. 
Information of the kind sought is scanty,

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



although the ancient authorities appear to have 
been most diligently ransacked. From the 
elder Pliny, from Strabo and Plutarch and 
Vitruvius, the following is gleaned concerning 
the famous library at Pergamon : 

" These magnificent structures, which won for Per- 
gamon the distinction of being ' by far the noblest city 
in Asia Minor,' were in the main due to Eumenes the 
Second, who, during his reign of nearly forty years 
(B. C. 197-59) was enabled, by the wise policy of 
supporting the Romans, to transform his petty state 
into a powerful monarchy. The construction of a library 
is especially referred to him by Strabo, and from the 
statement of Vitruvius that it was built for the delight 
of the world at large (in communem delectationem), we 
may infer that it was intended to be public. That he 
was an energetic book-collector, under whose direction 
a large staff of scribes was perpetually at work, may be 
gathered from the well-known story that his biblio- 
graphical rival at Alexandria, exasperated by his activity 
and success, conceived the ingenious device of crippling 
his endeavours by forbidding the exportation of papyrus. 
Eumenes, however, says the chronicler, was equal to 
the occasion, and defeated the scheme by inventing 
parchment. It is probable that Eumenes not only began 
but completed the library, for in less than a quarter of 
a century after his death (B. C. 133) the last of his 
descendants bequeathed the city and state of Pergamon 
to the Romans. It is improbable that they would do 
much to increase the library, though they evidently took 
care of it, for ninety years later, when Mark Antony 
is said to have given it to Cleopatra, the number of 
works in it amounted to two hundred thousand." 

Classical allusions to collections of books in 
Greece are scanty and disappointing, merely 
proving the existence of such collections. 
Strabo, as cited by our author, preserves a tra- 
dition that Aristotle was the first to make a 
collection of books, and that he taught the kings 
of Egypt how to arrange a library. Hadrian's 
Stoa at Athens is the only ancient building in 
the nature of a library that we know of in that 
city. Its ground plan and Pausanias's brief 
allusion to it are given by Mr. Clark. But 
when we come to Rome we find more abundant 
material for study. No fewer than twenty-six 
public libraries are said to have flourished 
there, at one time or another, under the Em- 
pire, and earlier private collections are known 
to have existed. The public libraries first found 
shelter in temples. An interesting passage from 
Aulus Gellius is quoted, concerning the library 
at Tibur, which is seen to have been housed in 
the temple of Hercules. Seneca (De Tran- 
quillitate Animi, ix.) is drawn upon for a para- 
graph throwing much light on the collection 
and care of books. He says : 

" Forty thousand books were burnt at Alexandria. I 
leave others to praise this splendid monument of royal 
opulence, as for example Livy, who regards it as ' a 
noble work of royal taste and royal thoughtfulness.' It 



was not taste, it was not thoughtfulness, it was learned 
extravagance — nay, not even learned, for they had 
bought their books for the sake of show, not for the 
sake of learning, — just as with many who are ignorant, 
even of the lowest branches of learning books are not 
instruments of study, but ornaments of dining-rooms. 
Procure then as many books as will suffice for use; but 
not a single one for show. . . . Excess in all directions 
is bad. Why should you excuse a man who wishes to 
possess book-presses inlaid with arbor-vkce wood or 
ivory; who gathers together masses of authors either 
unknown or discredited; who yawns among his thou- 
sands of books; and who derives his chief delight from 
their edges and their tickets ? You will find then in 
the libraries of the most arrant idlers all that orators 
or historians have written — book-cases built up as high 
as the ceiling. Nowadays a library takes rank with a 
bathroom as a necessary ornament of a house. I could 
forgive such ideas, if they were due to extravagant 
desire for learning. As it is these productions of men 
whose genius we revere, paid for at a high price, witb 
their portraits ranged in line above them, are got to- 
gether to adorn and beautify a wall." 

By far the greater part of Mr. Clark's book 
is devoted to mediaeval libraries. Why he 
chose for his title-page " the end of the eight- 
eenth century " as indicatmg the limit of hia 
labors, is a little puzzling, since his volume 
closes with an account of the library of John 
Boys, Dean of Canterbury, who died in 1625, 
and very few references are made to a later 
period. The splendors of the Vatican Library 
receive due attention at his hands, both in text 
and in illustration. But it is in the occasional 
excursions to one side of the main theme that 
the general reader will find most of real human 
interest. Apropos of monastic libraries, we 
have the following, from St. Benedict's Rule : 
"Idleness is the enemy of the soul; hence brethren 
ought, at certain seasons, to occupy themselves with 
manual labour, and again, at certain seasons, with holy 
reading. . . . Between Easter and the calends of Oc- 
tober let them apply themselves to reading from the 
fourth hour till near the sixth hour. From the calends 
of October to the beginning of Lent let them apply 
themselves to reading till the second hour. . . . During 
Lent let them apply themselves to reading from morning 
until the end of the third hour . . . and, in these days 
of Lent, let them receive a book apiece from the 
library, and read it straight through. These books are 
to be given out at the beginning of Lent." 

Thus it appears that monastic librarians, no 
less than public librarians of the present day, 
had their labors increased at the Lenten season^ 
Monastic libraries were, in fact, the public 
libraries of the Middle Ages ; and that no re- 
ligious house was considered complete without 
its case of books is evident from the old epi- 
gram, " Claustrum sine armario, castrum sine 
armamentario." The chaining of books, the 
pledges exacted for their safe return when lent,, 
and, quaintest of all, the elaborate curses in-

scribed, as a deterrent to book-thieves, in 
mediaeval volumes, all bear witness to the high 
value put upon these literary treasures in an age 
when books were few and costly. Most readers 
will be surprised to learn that wall-shelves did 
not come into use, for libraries, until the six- 
teenth century ; before that time the shelves 
were placed at right angles to the wall. 

In this brief sketch scant justice can be done 
to the work under review. Its full treatment 
of ancient and mediaeval library appliances, 
with copious photographic illustrations, can 
only be alluded to here. Abundant foot-notes 
serve the purpose of a bibliography, and a 
dozen pages of index close the volume. Our 
only disappointment is to find that, despite the 
somewhat comprehensive claims of title-page 
and prospectus, so many of the world-renowned 
libraries remain untouched upon by the author. 
Perhaps they were not deemed by him illustra- 
tive of his subject. The British Museum Li- 
brary, the Bibliotheque Nationale, the national 
libraries at Florence and Naples and Madrid, 
the Imperial Public Library at St. Petersburg 
and that at Vienna, the royal libraries at Berlin 
and Munich and Brussels, the university 
libraries of Leyden, Utrecht, Louvain, Bo- 
logna, — all of these, and a dozen more that 
might be named, are shut out in the cold. 
But it would be both rash and ungracious to 
criticize the learned author's choice of material, 
after he has laboriously gleaned for us so rich 
a harvest of curious and valuable information 
from sources that are in many cases by no 
means easy of access. One hundred and fifty- 
six illustrations, including forty-three full-page 
plates, adorn the text ; and the wide margins, 
clear print, and substantial binding, all con- 
tribute their share toward clothing a scholarly 
work in a becoming garb.

The ViGOROUS Dr. Smol.l.ett.* 



Wilkie Collins late in his life (he died in 
1889) declared that no publisher would dare 
risk a complete edition of Smollett or Sterne. 
He had in mind the coarseness of those eight- 
eenth century writers. Yet here, not many 
years after, is a handsome complete edition of 
the former and perhaps more objectionable

gravure. New York : Imported by Charles Scribner's Sons. 



author, in twelve volumes, of the large-paper, 
illustrated, sumptuous kind,, and inclusive even 
of the odds and ends of the vigorous Dr. Smol- 
lett's works. 

The appearance of such an edition seems to 
mean an interesting change in the public taste 
in English fiction. It indicates in the first 
place that, owing no doubt to the prevalence of 
much realistic writing of the plain-spoken sort, 
we are now more sympathetic to the coarse, 
more tolerant of the occasional foul, than we 
were, say, a quarter of a century ago. Again, 
there is in all probability more interest on the 
part of the public in fiction as such than was 
true earlier ; the Novel to-day is more fiercely 
dominant than it was when Wilkie Collins 
died, only a dozen years ago. Hence this in- 
terest, acting retrospectively, includes a novel- 
ist of one hundred and fifty years ago like 
Smollett. 

And yet again : the critical and scholarly 
attention paid to this typical modern form of 
literature has had its effect in drawing the gen- 
eral reader's attention to older work ; and the 
fact that fiction is now studied commonly m 
college courses attracts to the eighteenth cen- 
tury men who founded and shaped the Novel 
attention at once earnest and intelligent. Na 
doubt all these influences may be operative in 
making such a mercantile venture as a fine 
definitive edition of Smollett advisable, even 
profitable. I would in no wise imply by these 
reflections the slight importance of Tobias 
Smollett. He was vastly enjoyed as a story- 
teller in his day, as he was well-hated as a man ; 
he is a by no means slender link in the evolu- 
tion of English fiction ; and, which is the main 
thing for the present-day reader, he can still 
be read in his best books with hearty relish. 
To be sure, both Richardson and Fielding are 
more important in the fictional development, 
coming earlier and being greater novelists. Yet 
it may well be questioned if, for handing on 
the story of episode and picaresque adventure 
— a branch of fiction now much in evidence in 
current story-making — Smollett is not more 
directly in the line of Cervantes, LeSage, and 
Defoe than even Fielding. There is, too, a 
certain benefit, in these days of extravagant 
statement regarding living and very new novel- 
writers, in looking back at the by-gone wor- 
thies in order to realize that, after all, brave 
men lived before Agamemnon : that superla- 
tives steadily used lose their emphasis. 

Nine of the dozen volumes comprising this 
new edition are taken up by Smollett's major

stories : " Roderick Eandom," " Peregrine 
Pickle," "Ferdinand, Count Fathom," and 
*' Humphrey Clinker." The generous type 
and large-paper form necessitates two volumes 
for each novel, — three in the case of " Pickle." 
To handle such books sets one on dreams of 
the good old leisurely days of the three-decker, 
when hurry was not in writer or reader. The 
remaining three volumes contain such minor 
things as the tale called "Sir Lancelot 
Greaves," the travels and miscellanies in 
verse and prose, only of value to the student 
who would trace the novelist's growth and de- 
cadence and have a fuller understanding of the 
man. Smollett's very bad dramas, here printed, 
bring a realization of how ill it fares with the 
cobbler who leaves his last. 

The introduction is written by Mr. W. E. 
Henley, who is just now in the public eye be- 
cause of his churlish, curious exhibition of bad 
taste in attempting to throw disillusionment 
upon his old-time fellow in life and literature, 
R. L. Stevenson. Trenchant critic and true 
poet Mr. Henley is, however ; and this bit of 
criticism is in his familiar jerkily brilliant and 
bookish style. Those who expect a critic to 
show cause why he takes the trouble to bow 
some piece of literature into their presence, 
may perhaps wonder that Mr. Henley was 
selected to do this task ; he is savage enough 
with Dr. Smollett, who is not to be numbered 
among his literary loves, and who, as a man, 
he exposes in all his weakness. But there is 
much to stimulate the student in what he says, 
and in the final summing-up full credit is given 
the eighteenth century story-teller's contribu- 
tion to English fiction ; especially does he praise 
him for his high spirits and vividness of char- 
acter drawing (in which Dickens was later to 
imitate and surpass him). One of the most 
interesting things about Smollett, by the way, 
is the fact that he was confessedly a favorite 
with Charles Dickens, and that there is a cer- 
tain resemblance of method and manner (inter- 
vallo longo) between the older man and his far 
greater successor. Mr. Henley, too, very prop- 
erly compliments Smollett on his initiating 
truthful pictures of the British Navy, — a field 
afterwards cultivated with admirable results 
by Marryat ; and quite as properly points out 
Smollett's lack of proportion and construction 
in his stories, his tendency to caricature, his 
absence of high ideals. He makes the story of 
his literary life dramatic by leading up to the 
best novel, " Humphrey Clinker," published 
the year of his death. " So passed the old 



stark pagan," says Mr. Henley, with a sort of 
grim approval : in fact, one feels there must be 
some sympathy between the seamy, vigorous 
novelist and the poet who in the splendid lines 
beginning " Out of the Night that Covers Me," 
preaches a doctrine of agnostic stoicism. 

In his relative placing of the novels, with 
" Humphrey Clinker " at their head, Mr. 
Henley's judgment is sound, and he pulls the 
second-rate work to pieces with a roughness 
such as Smollett was wont himself to use in 
regard of others. The critic speaks of his 
" stinks and nastinesses," of how in " The Ad- 
ventures of an Atom " " he bemerded every- 
thing and everybody," — until the reader at 
times wonders in which century Mr. Henley 
belongs, — the eighteenth or nineteenth. Truth 
to tell, this latter day writer is no more for 
squeamish stomachs than is the novelist he 
introduces. 

Of the four main novels of Smollett, three, 
— "Roderick Random," "Peregrine Pickle," 
and " Humphrey Clinker," — are still well- 
known and read. The fourth, " Sir Lancelot 
Greaves," Mr. Henley dispatches in a charac- 
teristic manner : " I have said nothing of it," 
he remarks, " for the simple reason that I find 
so little merit in it that I have no more to 
say," — which is a good example of modern 
impressionist criticism, though accurate enough 
so far as the work in question is concerned. 
Of the other stories, "Roderick Random" is 
important because (like Dickens's " David 
Copperfield ") it is more autobiographic than 
his other books, and has some telling portraits ; 
" Peregrine Pickle " is a better novel, having 
less exaggeration, and on the whole more of 
unity — although disfigured by the episodic 
" Memoirs of a Lady of Quality." In these 
books and in " Clinker," the latter written 
when he was physically broken, such characters 
as Bowling and Bramble and Pipes have names 
of the conjuring kind — and, surely, a fiction- 
ist's power in permanent portraiture is what 
gives him a lasting place. In " Clinker," too, 
the usual faults are minimized. There is a 
" go " to the book, and indeed in the other two, 
a hearty participation of the author in the life 
depicted, that produces an answering effect 
upon the reader and is a mark of our elder fic- 
tion in contrast with the modern method, which 
places the author coldly outside of and aloof 
from his creations, it being deemed a sign of 
literary bad breeding to obtrude himself or 
show personal interest in his puppets. Which- 
ever way is best, few will fail to relish this

earlier hearty abandonment in the work. Of 
the diction of Smollett it should be said that 
he has the great gift of making his personages 
talk in character and exhibit themselves through 
•dialogue rather than by description. 

In comparing a novelist like Smollett with 
the best in English fiction to-day, the final 
thought, nevertheless, is likely to be — with all 
recognition of his talent and sturdy force — 
that the gains in both art and ethics have been 
substantial. The careless rough-and-tumble 
<iisplay of venality, profligacy, and brutality 
in these eighteenth century pages is all uncon- 
sciously a revelation of how far we have since 
advanced in decency, in refinement, in spiritual 
ideals. And quite as truly, the progress in the 
technique of novel-making since Smollett's time 
is a matter for satisfaction. No novelist of our 
day has more genius for fiction than had Henry 
•Fielding; but all novelists of the first rank 
now will avoid Fielding's defects and those of 
his contemporaries : the carelessness of con- 
struction in the bringing in of loose, rambling 
episodic material ; the failure to respect truth 
rather than theatric effect of scene and char- 
acter; the lapses from the clean, the frank 
catering to gutter tastes ; the clumsiness in 
attempting to make dialectic or other varia- 
tions from normal English speech. Yet, since 
life is more than art, those earlier novelists 
often have an effect of power, of reality, of the 
atmosphere that makes for illusion, that has 
not since been surpassed. And Smollett, in 
his obvious faults and equally obvious virtues, 
stands at Fielding's shoulder, a doughty lieu- 
tenant of that incomparable captain.

Religion and REVOL.tJTioN,* 

The substance of Mr. Sloane's new volume 
was delivered in a course of eight lectures be- 
fore the Union Theological Seminary of New 
York. Considered as lectures before a distinctly 
professional body, interested primarily in the 
relations of church and state in a critical period 
of history, the point of view of the author 
would not require extended examination. But 
regarded as a scholarly analysis of the spiritual 
oauses of the French Revolution, — and it is in 
this light that Mr. Sloane presents his expanded 
lectures to the public, — the novelty and ex-

treme statement of the thesis maintained by 
the author attract instant attention. 

Mr. Sloane's thesis, as presented in his pre- 
face, is that historians have overestimated the 
political and social causes of the Revolution, 
and of the spasmodic progressions in that Re- 
volution ; that in considering the conditions 
which checked the normal course of reform, 
undue emphasis has been placed on national 
bankruptcy, secular feudalism, and the " mys- 
terious, secret upheaval attributed to mental 
exaltation, of which so much has been sug- 
gested and hinted, but about which nothing is 
known." Later it is admitted in the body of 
the work that the interference of foreign powers 
was a potential factor in hurrying France into 
excesses, yet neither this nor all other causes 
combined equalled in intensity that " mightiest 
obstructive force . . . ecclesiastical fanaticism 
both positive and negative." In the character 
and organization of the church and in its arti- 
ficial connection with the state, Mr. Sloane 
finds the conditions that most irritated the 
reformers of France. In the stubborness of 
the higher clergy in clinging to lucrative abuses 
upon which they fattened, he discovers the 
main source of the fatal contentions of the 
National Assembly. In the struggle between 
the honest fanaticism of the lower clergy upon 
the one side, and the equally honest fanaticism 
of the theoretical reformers of church and 
faith upon the other, the author finds the cru- 
cial antagonisms which, developing into bitter 
hatred, wrecked the cause of moderate reform. 
In brief, questions of church and religion are 
depicted as causative to a greater degree than 
any other, both in the inception and in the 
progress of the French Revolution. 

Mr. Sloane's work is a delight to the student 
of history for its scholarly method, its keen 
analysis, and its choice language. It carries 
with it the impression of thorough research, 
and of exact and painstaking intellectual hon- 
esty. It presents in more logical form than 
has hitherto been offered in English, the mental 
attitude of churchmen and reformers in France, 
and the incidents which made evident that at- 
titude. Hence it is that anything approaching 
a criticism of the book as a whole is undertaken 
with extreme diffidence, for so masterly a work 
in general deserves only critical approbation. 
Nevertheless, if the author's thesis is rightly 
understood, it is impossible to accept without 
question the conclusions presented. Is it not 
possible that Mr. Sloane has elevated occasions 
into causes; and that, judging events uncon-

sciously distorted, he may have misapprehended 
their true relation ? It is no doubt true that 
immediately before 1789 questions of clerical 
privilege and of the badly adjusted relations 
of church and state formed a considerable part 
of the general topic of reform agitating the 
circles in which such affairs were being dis- 
cussed. Yet these circles included but a small 
proportion of the people of France, for, as 
Mr. Sloane freely recognizes, the majority of 
Frenchmen were fairly well satisfied with exist- 
ing church conditions. But even if we go so 
far as to admit that the National Assembly of 
1789 ranked first in importance the renovation 
of the church by the curtailing of unjust priv- 
ileges, it does not follow that the subsequent 
contests over religion and religious organiza- 
tion constituted the central essential struggle in 
the battle of factions, nor is that historical per- 
spective necessarily correct which exhibits the 
violence and license of the Revolution as due to 
repeated conflicts between religious partisans. 
It will be admitted that the French Revo- 
lution, however unique in many particulars, 
had this in common with all other revolutions 
or similar periods of public exaltation — that 
the Revolution itself became the God of the 
revolutionists. It was idealized, incarnated ; 
it became the Great Cause without any true 
conception of the principles for which it stood, 
or the point to which it tended. When after 
1789 it became evident that the hoped-for po- 
litical and social millenium was not to be im- 
mediately realized, and that the Cause was in 
danger of failing in its objects, determined 
opposition, either secret or open, was immedi- 
ately suspected, and the attempt made to remove 
the obstacle. Gradually the religion of revo- 
lution increased its hold upon the people, and 
the removal of obstacles to progress became 
more and more a matter of vengeance. After 
the flight of the Emigres, the Church was the 
only existing body in France which stood for 
that most hated thing, the ancient Regime. 
When, therefore, hopes and expectations were 
frustrated, and prophecies of social and polit- 
ical betterment were unfulfilled, promoters and 
preachers of revolution sought a cause. It is 
not strange that they attributed failure to the 
secret opposition of the clergy. The result 
was a series of violent and embittered attacks 
upon the clergy and upon religion itself. This 
violence, displayed by each successive faction 
in control of the government of France up to 
1795, was not, as Mr. Sloane maintains, caused 
by the stubborn opposition of clerics and people 



to projects of reform, nor was the general vio- 
lence of the Revolution due to that cause. The 
attack upon the Church and upon the Catholic 
religion was essentially due to the blind desire 
to find a scapegoat. The general and increasing 
tendency to violent methods was partly the 
result of the purely selfish machinations of 
politicians, partly an exhibition of that des- 
pairing fanaticism which dared any excess in 
the worship of its God — the Revolution. The 
clergy and the ancient faith were in truth bit- 
terly assailed and unjustly charged with the 
failure of the radical programme. But do the 
debates and agitations over church and faith 
prove that questions of church organization, 
and of religious belief, were in themselves the 
vital causes of contentions ? Is there not great 
reason to regard these contentions as exhibi- 
tions of the inherent violence of the party in. 
power, which, seeking a scapegoat, found it 
in the Church, — the only remaining repre- 
sentative of the ancient monarchy. 

If this view is correct, if the angry debates 
on religion, the rapid and startling changes in 
church organization and in faith, were les» 
causes of excesses than occasions of them, then 
Mr. Sloane's proposition is not convincingly 
proved. In undertaking a specialized study 
for a limited audience and upon a limited topic,^ 
he has seemingly fallen into the specialist's 
error of over-estimating the importance of the 
particular subject investigated, at the expense 
of other and equally potent factors. Never- 
theless, while it seems impossible to accept the 
extreme statements of the author of the causa- 
tive position occupied by questions of religious 
reform after 1789, it is still but just to credit 
him with having proved that somewhat greater 
importance, than has been customary with his- 
torians, should be attached to the religious 
situation after that date.

The Classification of Books.* 

In the early part of last year, the Librarian 
of Princeton University, Dr. Ernest C. Rich- 
ardson, was invited to deliver before the New 
York State Library School, under the auspices 
of the Alumni, two lectures on the science and 
art of classification. These lectures proved 
so notable a contribution to the subject that 
their appearance in book form, with the added

virtues of an Introduction and an Appendix 
containing an " Essay towards a Bibliograph- 
ical History of Systems of Classification," is a 
matter for congratulation among library work- 
ers. Dr. Richardson's work not only reflects 
great credit upon himself as a high type of the 
scholarly librarian, but fully justifies the wis- 
dom of the Alumni Association in instituting 
these valuable lectures. 

It may be said at the outset that the book is 
in no sense elementary or technical, but pre- 
supposes on the part of the reader a fair 
acquaintance with practical library systems. 
Indeed, the first lecture, on " The Order of 
the Sciences," is sufficiently formidable even 
to the trained librarian, with its " mirroring of 
the outer cosmos," its " complex of ions," and 
so forth ; yet with all its rather profound phi- 
losophical and theoretical character it does 
nevertheless present in a very sound scientific 
way the true order of the sciences, and should 
be of distinct value to the librarian as a theo- 
retical basis of classification. 

However, it is in the second lecture, devoted 
to " The Classification of Books," that the 
book reaches, in our opinion, its greatest inter- 
est and value. The subject is treated in a 
fascinating and stimulating manner which must 
arouse feelings of gratitude to the author in 
the mind of every thoughtful librarian, and 
cannot fail to be extremely helpful in creating 
a practical and at the same time scientific atti- 
tude toward the work of classification. The 
importance of classification to the library and 
to the reading world is given brief but ade- 
quate notice, and the " Decimal" and " Expan- 
sive " systems come in for their due share of 
praise. Dr. Richardson concludes his notice 
of these two systems with the following words, 
which may serve at the same time as a helpful 
stimulus to every librarian engaged in classifi- 
catory work. "As classification itself is the 
highest function of the librarian's work, calling 
into play every faculty and every attainment of 
knowledge, — the acme of bibliothecal work, — 
so these two systems of classification mark the 
high-water line of American library science, 
and are the climax of its achievement." 

As an Appendix the author gives an excel- 
lent and fairly complete bibliography of classi- 
fication systems from the time of Plato to the 
present day, in many cases including an out- 
line of the system advocated. 

Dr. Richardson's book should be hailed as 
a most welcome addition to the literature of 
library science. Clarence W. Perley. 



An " Everyday JLwe " of Washington.* 



Mr. Norman Hapgood's life of Washington 
is sufficiently unlike all others of the many that 
have been written to warrant its publication. 
It may be called an every-day life of the first 
American, as distinguished from those that 
give only the dignified and the formal in his 
life. Yet it is not like the " true " lives that are 
so popular just now, for it does not confine itself 
to the trifles that are not worth preserving and 
to recounting the shortcomings of its subject 
and the charges that hostile venom may have 
concocted during the bitter struggles of that 
most bitter period of our national history. Mis- 
takes and shortcomings are not passed over, 
even the trivial things that throw light upon 
Washington's character are not wanting; but 
these do not make up the whole story. They 
appear in the proportion of real life. This 
treatment distinguishes Mr. Hapgood's book, 
and gives it strength and interest. 

It is not a political nor a military biography,, 
though, of course, the military and the politi- 
cal sides of Washington's life are given in due 
proportion. But they are given in a general 
way ; important battles are sometimes dismissed 
in a line, or are left unmentioned. Great pol- 
icies are passed over, or get but a word. It is,. 
rather, a setting forth of the personal life and 
character of the man to whom Americans have 
given the first place in their esteem, if not in 
their love, whom the whole world considers one 
of the consummate flowers of the Anglo-Saxon 
race. The formal Washington, the demi-god 
of the older biographies, is not here. The hu- 
man element is made prominent, the tone being^ 
throughout sympathetic and appreciative. It 
is realistic and distinctly modern in manner, 
yet fair and well-balanced, giving the nobler 
side of the life and shattering no sane ideals 
of our national hero. 

Perhaps the most valuable service rendered 
by the book is the opportunity it gives the 
reader to see the development in Washington's 
character. His childhood was ordinary ; " not 
until the time for deeds does any touch of dis- 
tinction appear." 

" This poverty might be ascribed to chance, and to 
barren witnesses, were it not that, for many years after 
Washington became conspicuous in action, the accessi- 
ble expressions of this personality were so bare that 
their interest depends wholly on his importance. . . . 
That his learning was small is not to be attributed to 
scant opportunity, since he never showed much hunger

for books, and many famous men, who later surrounded 
and obeyed him, won more education against greater 
odds." 

He seems to have had but a short boyhood and 
no free youth. At sixteen he was a public sur- 
veyor, enduring the hardships of that profes- 
sion in the wilderness. At the same age, his 
journal, with the formal sentiments of a pre- 
mature manhood, contains references to a "low- 
land beauty," confirming other indications of 
a later period that his heart was extremely 
susceptible to feminine charms. At nineteen 
he was made adjutant-general (^with the rank 
of major) in one of the four military districts 
of Virginia, and at twenty he inherited Mount 
Vernon through the death of his brother. At 
twenty-one his public life began with his famous 
mission to warn the intruding French at Fort 
Duquesne, and the next year he fired the shot 
that was heard around the world and set a large 
part of it aflame with war. 

During his earlier life, we find him displaying 
many human traits. He was insistent in demand- 
ing promotion, and not backward in informing 
those in authority of his services. He was a 
stickler for every point of " honor," and had 
to be tactfully managed to prevent his resigna- 
tion. He was ready to make statements to the 
Indians that are charitably called " fictions " 
to get them to do as he wished. He was obstin- 
ate for his opinion ; it was said by an associate, 
on one occasion, that "his behavior about the 
roads was noways like a soldier." He was some- 
times ready to blame the other side for doing 
the very thing that he was trying to do. He 
was much fonder of giving advice than he was 
of taking it. All of this goes to show only 
that the great qualities had to grow in him as 
they have to grow in other great men. The 
young Washington was neither sage nor saint, 
though he was a remarkably forceful and effi- 
cient young man ; the common ideal of him 
was realized only in his later life. 

We think of Washington as a grave, stern 
man ; he was this, except in the inner circle 
of friendship, and through most of his career 
a gloom seemed to rest upon him that was 
partly natural and partly caused by the almost 
impossible burdens that he was called upon to 
bear, which were made heavier by ill-health. 
If all Americans had been self-sacrificing pa- 
triots like himself, as we fondly used to think 
they were, the burdens of his military and of 
his civil life would have been comparatively 
light. But as a general, he had to work with 
soldiers that were untrained and without arms 



or supplies, too many of whom were insubor- 
dinate and even cowardly ; too many of his 
officers were incompetent, foisted upon the 
army through political intrigue, or cowardly or 
greedy. Officers intrigued against him ; the 
soldiers abandoned the army in regiments at 
critical moments. The States were jealous of 
one another, and the Congress was incompetent. 
And as President, he had to suffer from the 
same popular vices, though they were differ- 
ently manifested. It was through the fires of 
such trials that his patience was developed, his 
wisdom and tact were perfected, and all the 
lower forms of ambition were eliminated from 
his character. But who can wonder that his 
terrible responsibilities, together with the evils 
against which he had to contend, oppressed 
him and shadowed his life with gloom ? He 
lacked the sense of humor that enabled Lin- 
coln to throw off for a time even heavier bur- 
dens and preserve the elasticity of his mind. 

Mr. Hapgood's judgments upon the charac- 
ter and work of Washington are sympathetic 
and sound, and we are tempted to quote some 
of them in conclusion of our notice. 

" It was this combination of a passionate nature, in- 
cluding an aggressive, dominating will, with an intensely 
just and ethical spirit, that made it possible for him to 
have one of the rarest and greatest of his qualities — 
the unequalled dignity of his presence. . . . The 
eulogies of him are full of immortal tributes to the 
worth of blood and judgment well commingled. Per- 
haps it is largely because, although passionate, he was 
not passion's slave, that the world has worn him in its 
heart's core. With such a character, and without genius, 
he needed occasion to show his worth. . . . Without 
great events, Washington would not have been famous; 
and, on the other hand, he made events great by his 
ability in meeting them. It does not follow because a 
man is of the type that waits for occasions that he does 
less to mould history. . . . Goodness is universal rather 
than peculiar, and the greatness of Washington had its 
base in the power to be largely and impressively right. 
. . . Born to lead some of the most difficult movements 
of history, he saw only the things which were, and his 
life illustrates the sublimity that truth and strength 
may reach without beauty or imagination. . . . Wash- 
ington's appeal has been great to the masses, because 
he was a hero; not less strong to the first minds of all 
nations, also because he was a hero, but different from 
the rest. It is to the merely clever that he must fre- 
quently seem dull. Those to whom Washington seems 
good but uninteresting perhaps need an argument that 
goodness and interest are inseparable; that large Tight- 
ness is, maturely seen, the foremost human trait. With 
this moral justness in Washington went courage. . . . 
If Washington's name is as great as any in the annals 
of political history, it is because of deeds which the world 
values now even more than it did a hundred years ago. 
His was a noble nature, with a sanity, a balance, a 
power of endurance, seldom rivalled; but his glory is 
not mainly personal. It is not primarily the effulgence 



1902.]

of some rare and individual superiority. It is universal. 
It is the concentration in a man of those merits which 
are most needed in the rulers of mankind. It is the 
triumph of integrity, of patience, of courage, of loyalty 
in the service of his country. It is because he was 
with constancy for the right, and so powerful in its 
service, that he has such honor from the world. Only 
great talents could have accomplished what Washing- 
ton accomplished; but no genius alone, however pro- 
digious, could fill that place in the world's history which 
is held by Washington's clearness of view and unbend- 
ing moral strength."

Recent American Fiction.* 



The '•American Novel Series," which has occu- 
pied our attention upon several occasions during 
the past year, is now completed by the publication 
of "When Love Is Young," by Mr. Roy Rolfe 
Gilson, and " The Debatable Land," by Mr. Arthur 
Colton. There are an even dozen of the volumes 
altogether, one for every month of the year. Mr. 
Gilson's story is the tale of a boy's love affairs from 
ten to twenty-five. There are several of these af- 
fairs, from the childish entanglements of the village 
school to the serious passion which comes at the 
close. Robbie Dale offers some slight suggestion 
of Mr. Barrie's "Sentimental Tommy," but the 
story of his infantile affections is not thrilling. 
When he goes to the great city to earn his living, 
we hope for better things, and the episode of the 
innocent Bohemia into which he is plunged for a 
few months is prettily managed. After his charmer 
deserts him, he becomes melancholy, goes back to 
his village home, and there meets his fate in the 
person of a young woman who teaches music, plays 
Chopin most seductively, and sits on the front steps 
when the day's work is done. Robbie goes to her 
house one morning, helps her to wash the dishes,

it is doing in the "American Novel Series " remains 
a mystery. 

" The Debatable Land " is an impressionistic 
story of the Civil War. The narrative is found in 
streaks, imbedded in a matrix of futile philosophical 
musings. The scene of the story is first placed in 
the neighborhood of Hamilton, New York, and then 
transferred to the Shenandoah Valley at the time 
of the Peninsular Campaign. The characters and 
their motives are throughout hinted at rather than 
defined, and most of the threads of the interest are 
dropped without being unravelled. The book is a 
very unsatisfactory performance, and brings the 
series to anything but a brilliant conclusion. Re- 
viewing the series as a whole, we must say that it 
represents a good idea badly carried out. Such 
unevenness is not often found in a set of books that 
are intended to have some sort of uniform excel- 
lence. There are two really fine novels among the 
dozen, " Martin Brook," by the late Morgan Bates, 
and " Days Like These," by Mr. E. W. Townsend. 
Four others may be called tolerably good novels, 
but the rest have no reasonable excuse for exist- 
ence. We judge that the publishers, having seen 
their way to give the series a fair start, trusted to 
luck for its completion. If so, it must be admitted 
that luck deserted them upon a number of occa- 
sions. 

Mr. Cable's new novel, "The Cavalier," is a 
story of our Civil War as viewed from the stand- 
point of the Confederate soldier. The scene is laid 
in Mississippi, and the action is concerned with 
raids, skirmishes, and bushwhacking, rather than 
with the pitched battles and the larger aspects of 
the struggle. There is little of the war passion in 
its pages, and no rhetorical exploitation of the great 
issues of the struggle. The soldiers do their fight- 
ing as a matter of business, and the real interest of 
the story is private rather than public or historical. 
" The Cavalier " is not an easy book to read. Mr. 
Cable has always had the fault of supersubtlety,. 
and never more noticeably than in this case. He 
rarely tells a story or exhibits a character in plain* 
terms, and even the minor incidents are related by 
indirection. We are constantly puzzled to under- 
stand his argument, and to view his figures in the- 
right light. If Mr. Cable were not so very charm- 
ing a writer, this quality would be fatal ; as it is, 
we find it exasperating, but are unwilling to miss 
the refined art and the delicate sensibility that are- 
characteristic of his work. 

" Circumstance," Dr. Weir Mitchell's new novels 
seems somewhat dull in the opening chapters, and 
we expect from it little more than agreeable enter- 
tainment in the society of the respectable Philadel- 
phians whom it presents to the view. But presently, 
and in spite of the essentially commonplace people 
who figure in its pages, we become conscious of a 
quickening of interest, which reaches a considerable 
degree of intensity as we approach the end. In the

adventuress and her scapegrace brother, whose con- 
duct serves to relieve the good breeding and refine- 
ment of the other characters, we have two singularly 
effective examples of skilful delineative art; while 
the characters who represent respectability soon 
develop interesting individualities, owing to the 
analysis which gradually brings out the finer shad- 
ings of their thought and temperament. The ad- 
venturess is the chief figure in this drama of private 
interests, and she is almost worthy to be placed by 
the side of Becky Sharp, whom she resembles in 
her feline ways and her heartless selfishness, but 
from whom she is differentiated by the possession 
of criminal instincts. Dr. Mitchell is to be con- 
gratulated upon the sterling excellence of this novel, 
and upon the success with which he has handled his 
diflBcult material, creating a strictly legitimate in- 
terest which does not depend upon exaggeration or 
sensationalism for its effect. It is not a brilliant 
book, but brilliancy is an easy achievement as com- 
pared with the social insight of this novel. 

Dr. James M. Ludlow, who won a deserved rep- 
utation about fifteen years ago with a historical 
novel of the days of Scanderbeg, has gone still far- 
ther back in history for the theme of his " De- 
borah," which is a romance of the time of Judas 
Maccabaeus, and which deals with the revolt of that 
great leader against the oppressions of Antiochus 
Epiphanes. The conquest of the Greek by the 
Jew, and the triumphant occupation of Jerusalem 
by Judas and his followers, offers material for a 
highly-colored and effective story. Of this mate- 
rial Dr. Ludlow has made good use, and his por- 
trayal of the Jewish champion is a masterly piece 
of characterization. His heroine and her Greek 
lover (who turns out in the end to be also of Jew- 
ish birth) are sympathetically-conceived figures, 
although we must say that the portraits of the hero- 
ine, which serve the book for illustrations, are too 
evidently photographs of a modern girl in mas- 
querade costume to suggest the Deborah of the 
romance. Dr. Ludlow's diction, although inspired 
by biblical phraseology, now and then makes an un- 
fortunate descent from the exalted level demanded 
by such a book, and becomes mere twentieth cen- 
tury American. Archaeological faithfulness is out 
of the question in any book of this sort, but a cer- 
tain conventional artificiality is required for the 
purposes of the illusion, and from this the author 
too frequently lapses. Nevertheless, the story is a 
conscientious piece of workmanship, and fulfils 
most of the demands of romantic historical fiction. 

Mr. William Stearns Davis is the author of a 
romance of the First Crusade, with the historical 
cry of the crusaders for its title. Except for 
" Count Robert of Paris," the author says, this 
most interesting of all the crusades has not been 
put into a novel. It seems strange that the oppor- 
tunity has been neglected, yet we cannot from our 
recollection controvert the statement. " God Wills 
It ! " may best be described by saying that it makes 
much the same sort of impression as do the Polish 



historical romances of Mr. Sienkiewicz. The author 
has saturated himself in the history of the period, 
and has besides rich stores of imagination upon 
which to draw. Contrasting the book with Mr. 
Crawford's crusaders' story of a year or two ago, 
for example, we get some idea of its remarkable 
qualities. In the comparison, Mr. Crawford's book 
is pale while this is glowing, it is mechanical while 
this is living, it is grudging of its gifts while this is 
lavish in its largess. Most important of all, while 
Mr. Crawford's romance is little more than mildly 
exciting, this romance of Mr. Davis is thrilling 
throughout, and the effect is produced by legitimate 
means, not by any resort to sensationalism. These 
remarks are meant to be high praise, for such 
" God Wills It ! " deserves. It spreads before us a 
magnificent panorama of both historical and human 
interest ; it has for its background France, and 
Sicily, and the gorgeous East ; it has for episodes 
the preaching of Peter, the siege of Antioch, and 
the capture of Jerusalem ; it has for characters 
Godfrey, and Raymond and Tancred and Robert 
of Normandy. It is, moreover, historically just in 
its weighing of the forces — religious fanaticism, 
economic pressure, and personal valor — that de- 
termined the course and the consequences of the 
crusading movement. 

Mr. Crawford's new novel, " Marietta," is some- 
thing more than fiction. It is a tale of Venice in 
the fifteenth century, and makes us acquainted with 
the famous glass-makers, Angelo Beroviero and 
Zorzi Ballerin. Even the heroine, the daughter of 
Angelo, whom Zorzi wins despite paternal oppo- 
sition and a contemplated alliance with a noble 
family, is a character of actual history. Still, the 
interest of the romance is essentially private, and 
the material is handled in Mr. Crawford's most 
charming manner. His knowledge of Italian life, 
both present and past, is so intimate that he is en- 
abled to invest his figures with much vitality. That 
the book is one of invention coupled with observa- 
tion, rather than one of mere manufacture, is the pre- 
dominant impression that it makes upon us, which 
cannot be said, for example, of " Via Crucis," or 
certain others of Mr. Crawford's later writings. 

Mr. Charlton Andrews is a new writer of histor- 
ical romance, and his book with a Chaucerian title, 
" A Parfit Gentil Knight," is a highly creditable 
first production. Its scene is the French court of 
Charles IX. and the Queen-Mother, its historical 
setting is the strife between Catholics and Hugue- 
nots, culminating in the Massacre. The young 
Duke of Guise and the Prince of Anjou are among 
the chief characters introduced, and are about evenly 
matched as exemplars of villainy concealed beneath 
the courtly graces. The hero is a brave soldier, 
attached to the Prince of Montpensier, loving the 
princess with an unsullied devotion and finally 
giving his life for her. He is indeed " a verray 
parfit gentil knight," although his nobility of soul 
is possibly a trifle over-emphasized — in the Marquis 
of Posa fashion. Mr. Andrews has told an inter-

esting story, full of moving or exciting incident, 
And well-sustained as it leads up to its climax. 

We said some few weeks ago that the Indian 
was coming back into American fiction. Two un- 
usually good Indian stories with a historical back- 
ground have recently been published, and give 
•further evidence of the truth of our earlier state- 
ment. " The Road to Frontenac," by Mr. Samuel 
Merwin, is a straightforward story of new France 
at the close of the seventeenth century. The hero 
is a French oflBcer sent from Quebec to Frontenac 
on an important mission, and incidentally charged 
with the escort of a young woman. The journey 
up the river provides a sufficiency of adventure to 
'fill the book and keep its readers wide awake all 
the time. Mr. Merwin succeeds very well in his 
management of the picturesque and metaphorical 
language which, according to the accepted conven- 
tion since the days of Cooper, was used by the 
Indians in their harangues. The main thing is to 
be sustained and consistent in its use, and in this 
the author has been successful. His hero is a very 
doughty person indeed, who can out-talk the most 
eloquent of the braves. As for the love-story, it 
•may easily be imagined, since the circumstances of 
•the expedition make it inevitable. 

Mr. H. A. Stanley, in "The Backwoodsman," 
has told a story of the same Iroquois country, but 
the date is nearly a hundred years later, for the 
story is of the American Revolution. Its scenes 
and characters are curiously coincident with those 
used by Mr. Chambers in his " Cardigan," and the 
comparison is unfortunate, for Mr. Stanley's book 
cannot vie with that extraordinarily interesting ro- 
mance. We have the Johnsons, and the Butlers, 
and Joseph Brant as conspicuous figures, while the 
hero is not unlike Cardigan in his fortunes, and in 
his relation to the historical happenings of the 
time. The story runs pretty well through the Rev- 
olutionary period, and Sullivan's devastation of the 
Iroquois country occupies a central place. Mr. Stan- 
ley's Indian talk is of two kinds. There is the 
formal kind, which is unconvincing, because it puts 
such words as these on the lips of the orator : " For 
peace, brothers, surely hath victories, — bloodless 
victories, victories that are not symbolized by the 
bloody scalp." The other kind is such talk as this, 
which we make no doubt is the kind of language 
that an Indian really used : " Captain Brant, him 
glad Quedar choke White Skunk. All Mohawks 
glad. Quedar brave lad. Senekees all thirsty. 
Want drink blood White Oneida." Mr. Stanley's 
manner of narration is rather sti£E and prosaic, but 
he is evidently intimate with the history of his 
period, and knows the life of the Iroquois and the 
white ranger as nearly at first hand as one can 
know it after the lapse of a century. 

The " tales of nature and human nature " which 
>Dr. Henry van Dyke has brought together under 
the title of "The Ruling Passion," are eight in 
number. They are prefaced by a prayer, which is 
rather unusual for a work of fiction, but the pro- 



fession of the author makes it seem natural, and 
the good sense of the petition quite justifies the 
departure from precedent. "Lord let me never 
tag a moral to a story, nor tell a story without a 
meaning." Not a few novelists might profit by 
this example. Ruskin once wrote in " Fors " : 
"You might at first think that Dante's divisions 
were narrow and artificial in assigning each circle 
to one sin only, as if every man did not variously 
commit many. But it is always one sin, the fa- 
vourite, which destroys souls. That conquered, all 
others fall with it ; that victorious, all others follow 
with it." Conversely, we may say that one virtue 
saves souls, bringing the other virtues in its train. 
This is the essential thesis presented by Dr. van 
Dyke, and he exemplifies it by studies of ruling 
passions as varied as the angler's habit, the love of 
music, and the sacredness of a trust. The passion 
for justice is the theme of still another of these 
stories, and the hero is not a man, but a dog. The 
book is exquisitely written, expressive of tender 
sympathies and natural human feelings. Though 
the scenes and the characters are varied, " the sub- 
ject is always the same, the unseen, mysterious, 
ruling passion weaving the stuff of human nature 
into patterns wherein the soul is imaged and re- 
vealed." 

The gift of gentle satire, made evident by Mr. 
Henry Fuller's earlier novels, has been given its 
most effective display in " Under the Skylights," 
a collection of three stories bearing upon the con- 
ditions of artistic and literary life in Chicago. It 
is a book h, clef, no doubt, yet the portraiture is 
rather typical than specific, and the traits of each 
character are combined by a sort of eclectic process. 
In " The Downfall of Abner Joyce," the type por- 
trayed is that of the rugged genius from the country, 
who comes to town with the grim determination 
of reforming society from its very base, who believes 
in himself to an absurd extent, and whose earnest- 
ness offers a standing rebuke to all the graces and 
refinements of the polite world. He is an uncouth 
product of nature, and succumbs with difficulty to 
the taming process. His " downfall " consists in 
yielding to the blandishments of a young woman of 
the society that it is his function to denounce, and 
becomes complete when, as her submissive husband, 
he appears at a dinner in evening clothes, and par- 
takes of the wine that is served at the table. In 
the story of " Dr. Gowdy and the Squash " the type 
is that of the rhetorical clergyman who talks mag- 
niloquently about art, and imposes himself upon 
his followers as an authority upon subjects of which 
he is profoundly ignorant. This particular kind of 
humbug has never been more mercilessly exposed 
than in the present instance. " Little O'Grady vs. 
the Grindstone," the third of Mr. Fuller's stories, 
relates to an artistic competition for the decoration 
of a bank building. Its teaching is that art has a 
poor enough chance when forced to assert its claims 
against the forces of social intrigue and commercial 
Philistinism. We have hesitated to give these ab-

stracts, or any abstracts, of Mr. Fuller's stories, 
because almost everything that is characteristic 
escapes in the process of condensation. An abstract 
of Heine's " Reisebilder " would be anything but 
adequate to convey a notion of the charm of that 
work, and for about the same reasons we must say 
that to read Mr. Fuller's book is the only way of 
finding out how thoroughly delightful a book it is.

Briefs o x ye w Books. 

That Mr. James B. Kenyon — him- 

S::;Tii ««lf ^ ^"^^^ ^^ gr^««^»l verse -is 
also an ardent admirer of others' 
achievements in poetry, is made abundantly evident 
by his little volume of literary sketches entitled 
"Loiterings in Old Fields" (Eaton <&? Mains). 
That these slight essays should contain any impor- 
tant contribution to literary criticism is perhaps too 
much to expect. At any rate, they seem likely to 
profit the young student of letters rather than the 
more mature. To the latter it brings a little shock 
of surprise to be detained, at the mention of George 
Henry Lewes's name, by the explanation that he 
" was a student of philosophy, the author of a few 
philosophical treatises, and the writer of a Life of 
Goethe " ; and apropos of George Eliot's pen-name, 
to be thought in need of the following: "We know 
of but one other such instance of equal interest on 
record, and that is of a notable French woman 
who for many years sent forth her writings under 
the fictitious name of George Sand." Moreover, 
in the fugitive essay, which lays no claim to depth 
and substance, the reader is entitled to look for 
something like perfection of form ; and it arouses 
a slight feeling of disappointment, if not of resent- 
ment, and an incipient distrust of the author's 
nicety of taste, to open the book and find would 
(p. 200) carelessly used for should, the impossible 
form illy (p. 122) usurping the place of the adverb 
ill, and " the tuneful ilk " (p. 138) chosen as a 
happy designation of poets as a class. Sweetly 
(p. 125) is made to serve as an adjective, perhaps 
by justifiable analogy ; and, finally, a fondness for 
the split infinitive manifests itself. Dr. Kenyon's 
inclusion of " broad colloquialism " among the char- 
acteristics of George Eliot's prose style is mislead- 
ing, his meaning probably being that she makes her 
characters speak the language most natural to them. 
Although by occasional references he shows his 
familiarity with" Edward FitzGerald, he fails to in- 
clude that rare genius either among the noted letter- 
writers of our day or in the list of famous men 
born in the annus mirabilis, 1809. But — to wind 
up, like the Hebrew prophet, with words of peace — 
we have nothing bnt good to say of the chapters on 
Keats, Kossetti, and William Morris ; and it is no 
more than fair to close with a pregnant word from 
the essay on Lowell's letters, as a pleasant after- 



taste : "The writer who is not greater than his 
writings is a kind of impostor, for he creates in the 
minds of others a false conception of himself." 

The craft of ^ handbook on "Bookbinding and 

bookbinding, and the Care of Books," by Mr. Douglas 
the care of books. Cockerell, with many drawings by 
Mr. Noel Rooke, forms the initial volume of the 
"Artistic Crafts Series" (Appleton). In a gen- 
eral preface to the series, written by the editor, 
Mr. W. R. Lethaby, there is no mention of the fur- 
ther handicrafts to be given consideration, but the 
frequent mention of the name of William Morris 
leads one to conjecture that all the various trades 
which at one time or another engaged the attention 
of that well-nigh universal genius will be included, 
— these, of themselves, making a list fairly com- 
plete. The particular object of the series is dis- 
closed by Mr. Lethaby in words which leave nothing 
unsaid. 

'* We would have this series put artistic craftsmanship 
before people as furnishing: reasonable occupation for thos& 
•who would gain a liTelihood. Although within the bounds 
of academic art, the competition, of its kind, is so acute 
that only a few per cent can fairly hope to succeed a» 
painters and sculptors; yet, as artistic craftsmen, there is 
every probability that nearly every one who would pass 
through a sufl&cient period of apprenticeship to workmanship 
and design would reach a measure of success." 

There are some excellent observations on the part 
which design should play in all good workmanship, 
it being the intention of the series to insist upon 
both as equally essential to the best results ; but the 
crux of the matter is in the concluding sentence of 
the paragraph quoted. Mr. Cockerell, on his part,^ 
is explicit in describing, minutely and accurately, 
all the various processes which are used in bringing 
into existence a worthily bound book. He makes 
a nice distinction, which can be commended, be- 
tween " binding " a book, meaning the envelopment 
of its back and sides in some permanent material, 
and "casing" a book, signifying its enclosure in 
boards covered with paper or cloth, for commercial 
purposes. With the latter procedure he is con- 
cerned no further than to point out the essential 
differences between the two ; but he makes it clear 
at all times that modern bindings are in some 
instances without any element of permanency, and 
modern casings almost invariably so, — even to the 
extent of requiring the librarian to rebind his entire 
collection every few years. Mr. Cockerell's volume, 
describing as it does every process and tool con- 
nected with bookbinding, and containing much 
sensible advice on the care and preservation of 
books, is one that the librarian should not do with- 
out. 

To the series of " Great Masters in 
Painting and Sculpture " (Macmil- 
lan) we have the addition of a vol- 
ume on Francia, by Dr. George C. Williamson, and 
one on Brunelleschi, by Mr. Leader Scott. The 
volume on Francia contains considerable new matter

careful personal work in Bologna, where the artist 
was born and spent most of his life. Here he estab- 
lished a school of artists, numbering some two hun- 
dred students ; but notwithstanding this, and that 
he impressed his own ideas very firmly upon his 
pupils, his influence appears to have extended little 
beyond his immediate surroundings. His pictures 
betray no special sympathy with the classic or hu- 
manistic movement of his time. Perchance he was 
then looked upon as somewhat old-fashioned and 
out-of-date ; while now that his works are becoming 
better known, and some pictures that have been 
heretofore attributed to Kaphael or Perugino are 
now placed to his credit without fear of dispute, he 
stands among the choice spirits at the close of the 
Renaissance in Italy. — The biographer of Brunel- 
leschi has to deal with a man of entirely different 
type, a man who made his impression both at once 
and for all time on the worlds of art and science. 
He found architecture languishing and rapidly 
tending to become a mere mechanical art ; it was 
collective rather than individual in its efforts. De- 
scriptions of the earlier Roman and Tuscan build- 
ings record the name of the patron or ruling operaio, 
but very seldom the name of the designer. After 
Brunelleschi's grand strike for freedom, artists dared 
to stand alone, and the builders of the Renaissance 
shine out as separate men whose distinctive minds 
are impressed on their buildings, — Alberti, San 
Gallo, Michael Angelo, and the rest. The first to 
apply the classic bias to architecture, Brunelleschi 
carried it out on the purest possible lines ; that 
Italian Renaissance architecture is less noble than 
it might have been, is largely because later builders 
departed from his lead. The illustrations, mainly 
made from photographs, are a notable and delightful 
feature of both of these volumes. 



The beginningt 
of American 
lUerature. 



The set of three neat volumes en- 
titled " Colonial Prose and Poetry " 
(Crowell), prepared by Messrs. W. 
P. Trent and B. W. Wells, represents a happy 
thought on the part of both publishers and editors. 
We hasten to add that both have done their best in 
giving concrete expression to the thought, and that 
the resulting work is both outwardly delightful and 
intellectually stimulating. To those who are doubtful 
of the intellectual stimulus to be got from Cotton 
Mather and Michael Wigglesworth, we can say only 
that our colonial writers have abundant interest for 
those who are willing to look for it. Viewed from 
the narrow standpoint of sesthetics, they have little 
to offer ; but seen in the wider vision that broadens 
before the student of social history and the spiritual 
life, they occupy a large place in our annals. 
" Many who have gone to them with a smile have 
remained to be edified," say the editors; "in the 
earlier period men lived earnestly if not largely, 
they thought highly if not broadly, they felt nobly 
if not always with magnanimity." About fifty 
names are represented in this collection, besides 
such impersonal subjects as " The Bay Psalm Book," 



Dutch life in 
town and country/. 



" The New England Primer," and Bacon's Rebel- 
lion. John Smith, Cotton Mather, and Benjamin 
Franklin are the three worthies whose portraits 
rightfully preface the several volumes. The titles 
of these volumes indicate their range. The first is 
" The Transplanting of Culture," with such writers 
as Bradford, Winthrop, Cotton, Williams, Hooker, 
and Anne Bradstreet. The second is "The Begin- 
ning of Americanism," with such writers as John- 
son, Eliot, Wigglesworth, Penn, Sewall, and the 
Mathers. The third is " The Growth of National 
Spirit," with such writers as Prince, Edwards, 
Franklin, and Hutchinson. Each volume has an 
editorial preface, and each author represented has 
a biographical note. The entire work is so well 
contrived that it places us under a large debt of 
gratitude. Nothing of the sort has heretofore been 
accessible to the general reader, unless, perchance, 
he happened to own a Duyckinck, or had the vol- 
umes of the Stedman and Hutchinson " Library " 
on his shelves. But he can put these books in his 

pocket. 

One of the desirable results of the 
political situation of recent years is 
to make the American more than 
ever interested in what his fellow-citizens of the 
world — the citizens of other nations — think and 
do and feel. Our remoteness from most of the 
world-powers is apt to strengthen our indifference 
in this respect, and to induce in the popular mind 
a contempt for the foreigner that is not easily dis- 
guised. The series of volumes called " Our Euro- 
pean Neighbours " (Putnam) is to be commended 
as a worthy undertaking which will do much to 
counteract this undesirable tendency. The vol- 
ume on " Dutch Life in Town and Country " comes 
from the pen of Mr. P. M. Hough, who has long 
been a resident of The Hague, and has made good 
use of his opportunities. There is much of interest 
in the present-day life of this thrifty and sturdy 
people. From the country folk to the University 
professors, from the merchant to the professional 
classes, from laborer to courtier, the Dutch have 
developed a national life of their own, not to be 
confused with that of their neighbors. Their inde- 
pendence of spirit is a heritage that still is active 
in shaping their life in town and country. They 
form a nation well worth knowing ; and Mr. 
Hough's volume offers the most convenient and 
interesting way of becoming acquainted with them, 
accessible to English readers. It is a sympathetic 
yet critical, a discerning and comprehensive account 
of life in modern Holland.

" Intuitive Suggestion : A New Theory of the Evo- 
lution of Mind " (Longmans) offers an obvious 
though not an extreme case of this unfortunate 
malady. " Intuitive suggestion " is to him the key 
that unlocks all mystery. This means that tha author 
of this book, after asking any of the fundamental 
-questions relating to the constitution of the universe 
and of life, receives a satisfactory thrill when pro- 
nouncing the words " intuitive suggestion." He 
tells us that water must know intuitively when 32° 
Fahrenheit is reached in order that ice shall be 
formed ; that the magnet has an intuitive feeling 
for the north pole ; that the soaring of birds is far 
better explained by referring it to an intuitive knowl- 
edge of the laws of motion than to mechanical and 
physiological principles ; that the chemical elements 
have an intuitive seeking for their aflBnities ; and 
even that the land leeches of Ceylon do not smell 
"but intuitively know the approach of their prey. 
That we are also taught that telepathy will in the 
future be the normal mode of communication ; that, 
indeed, psychic force will outdo wireless telegraphy, 
and that suggestion will destroy noxious weeds and 
vermin, — all this seems of a piece with the theory 
of " intuitive suggestion." Such a volume is the 
inevitable result of the attempt to reason without

than in his " Gossip in a Library " ( Dodd, Mead 
& Co.), now republished with additional matter, 
after enjoying a healthy and successful existence 
through half a score of years. Originally written 
at the suggestion of an American editor for Amer- 
ican readers, it has never lost the merit of an orig- 
inal method especially adapted to the hurried needs 
of American general culture. Its readers will 
recall that in substance it contains the briefest little 
discourses on books of all sorts and conditions, 
addressed by a collector of rare volumes to other 
collectors — or, at least, to those in sympathy with 
his aims. The original preface is rightly retained, 
with its wondering protest against the imposition, 
by a nation calling itself civilized, of an import 
duty on books worth having; an imposition the 
more marked, had Mr. Gosse chosen to speak of 
it, for permitting books in languages other than 
English to come in duty free. A new preface for 
this edition has been added, suflBciently brief and 
informing to deserve quotation in full. Says the 
essayist : 

"It is with a great deal of pleasure that I learn that the 
passion for rare books still flourishes in America, and that a 
new edition of this little book is called for. In order to give 
it a certain character of freshness, I have added, for America 
only, an essay on a volume which grows steadily, and almost 
year by year, in value and interest. Perhaps the bibliograph- 
ical data which I have given may prevent some ardent bib- 



liophile from adding to his library an incomplete copy of 
White's ' Selborne,' a book which is particularly often offered 
in a mutilated or ' faked ' condition." 

This describes the difference between the former 
and the latter edition of " Gossip in a Library " 
with sufficient particularity, and it is pleasant to 
realize that no further changes have been made. 
The book is to be commended to all who love ele- 
gance and scholarship. 



Etsayi in 
Philosophy, 



Professor Howison has placed not 
only the special student of philos- 
ophy, but the general reader as well, 
under obligation to him for his essays on "The 
Limits of Evolution" and other subjects (Macmil- 
Ian). Not that the treatment of these themes is 
popular, — on the contrary, it is strictly philosophic ; 
but Professor Howison possesses the enthusiam and 
mastery of style which are ordinarily absent from 
works of this kind. The purpose of the book, as 
stated by the author, is to illustrate "the metaphysical 
theory " which he calls " Personal Idealism." This 
theory he seeks to present " in its bearings on all 
the chief human concerns, — on knowledge, joy, 
and devotion ; on Science, Art, and Religion." The 
paper which gives title to the book subjects the 
current doctrine of Evolution to a searching crit- 
icism which that doctrine preeminently calls for, 
and yet from which it in a measure revolts. It 
may yet present itself in its finality, not as an all- 
embracing theory of life and thought, but as having 
well-defined limits within which it is useful and 
valid. We can call special attention to the essay 
on the " Art- Principle as Represented in Poetry." 
This discussion of the significance of art, and the 
place of poetry in the order of the fine arts, will be 
found timely and instructive. The paper on " Human 
Immortality " places that qucBstio vexata in a new 
and surprising light, and gives to the hope which 
mankind seems incapable of relinquishing a form 
that fortifies it against many of the serious assaults 
that are made upon it. The reader will find these 
papers everywhere stimulating and elevating ; and 
whatever his views may be upon the final questions 
dividing philosophers and mankind at large, he will 
gain from these discussions new insights, new points 
of view, and helpful illuminations. 

A record of ^^ English reviewer has character- 

book-prices ized Mr. Elliot Stock's " Book-Prices 

in England. Current" as the "book-collector's 

Bible," and the phrase is altogether fitting. This 
work and its American companion are now indis- 
pensable items in the equipment of everyone who 
has to do with old books, — be he bookseller, 
librarian, or private collector. The fifteenth vol- 
ume, compiled as usual by Mr. J. H. Slater, is at 
hand, and covers the English auction season from 
October, 1900, to July, 1901. Though containing 
fewer entries than its immediate predecessor, the 
new volume is rather more bulky ; a fact which 
Mr. Slater attributes to the large number of very

rare or unusual items that came into the auction 
rooms during the season, and that call for full de- 
tailed description in this record. The English 
auction season of 1900-01 was unusually successful, 
the total amount realised on the 38,377 lots sold 
being something over $650,000. The average price 
per lot, about $17., is the highest on record. Oddly 
enough, one of the factors that Mr. Slater mentions 
as having to do with the general rise in the price 
of old books is the advent of the new century, 
« which, in imagination, has suddenly aged them 
by a huadred years." 

Mimumenu of the I" Preparing a work upon the^^'Mon- 
Christian Church, uments of the Early Church for a 
2d to 6th century, ggrjea of " Handbooks of Archaeology 
and Antiquities" (Macmillan), the Rev. Walter 
Lowrie, M.A., has not contented himself with ab- 
stracting his material from the literature of the 
subject already in existence, but has given the re- 
sults of entirely independent researches into such 
subjects as the Christian Cemeteries, Christian Ar- 
chitecture, Pictorial and Minor Arts, and Ecclesi- 
astical Dress, from the second to the sixth century 
of the Christian era. He has also, by reason of 
his having lately been a Fellow of the American 
School of Classical Studies at Rome, been able to 
anticipate the publication of some important works 
by recent explorers in these fields. His book is 
therefore a valuable contribution to a knowledge of 
Ecclesiastical antiquities, at a time when the pop- 
ular knowledge of that subject is undergoing revision 
by reason of the interesting facts being brought to 
light by the scientific investigations of men like 
Wilpert, Marucchi, De Fleury, Le Blant, Ficker 
Holtzinger, Venturi, Professor Ramsey, and others. 
As an introduction to the subject of which it treats, 
the book is invaluable, especially in view of the ex- 
haustive " Select Bibliography " which it furnishes. 
It is evident that the author exercised great self- 
restraint in keeping his treatment of the subject 
within the proportions of a handbook. 

In " A Short History of the Missis- 
^"^^-^ir^ "{ sippi Valley" (Houghton) Dr. James 

K. Hosmer has endeavored, in a 
small volume of a little over two hundred pages, to 
cover a vast range of both time and space. The 
book is very readable, both from the interest of the 
subject-matter and from the manner in which the 
interesting story is told ; yet only a few points are 
selected from a great number that demand atten- 
tion. Fifty pages are given to the Indians and the 
French ; another fifty to the early pioneers and the 
Revolution ; a third fifty carries the story on from 
the Ordinance of 1787 to Jackson's victory at New 
Orleans ; fifty are devoted to the Civil War ; and a 
brief chapter treats of the region at the close of the 
century. This outline will show the inadequacy of 
the book as a history of the region between the 
AUeghanies and the Rockies ; but certain aspects 
of the history are admirably treated, and some lit- 



Sehouler's life 
of Hamilton. 



tie-known worthies of Western history are brought 
to public attention. The book will be useful in a 
way, though one might wish that so skilful a writer 
had more fully covered the ground appropriated by 

his title. 

The life of Alexander Hamilton in 
the series of " Beacon Biographies" 
(Small, Maynard & Co.) has been 
written by Mr. James Sehouler, whose work as 
historian showed him to be in sympathy with Jef- 
ferson, rather than with Hamilton, in the party 
conflicts that attended the establishment of our gov- 
ernment. But this lack of partisan sympathy results 
in giving us a truer estimate of Hamilton than we 
can get from one who is blinded by the genius of 
the brilliant statesman, and few writers of more 
aristocratic principles have escaped this fascination. 
There is little of narrative in the book ; the author 
devotes himself to the higher task of discussion, 
explanation, and judgment. He gives due praise 
for the fruitful labors of Hamilton in bringing about 
the adoption of the Constitution and in establishing 
the finances of the new nation. But he also sets 
forth clearly Hamilton's defects of temperament 
and opinion, his restless egotism, his aristocratic 
contempt for the common people, and his lack of 
ability as a political leader that nearly thwarted 
his wise plans and did wreck his party.

ginning of recorded history to the present time, 
will be grateful for the compilation made by Mr. 
J. N. Larned, entitled " A Multitude of Counsel- 
lors" (Houghton). The collection is a very com- 
plete and well-chosen one, giving, first, extracts 
from the " Egyptian Book of the Dead," following 
with selections from Marcus Aurelius, Erasmus, 
and many others more and less well known, and 
concluding with so modern a counsellor as Thoreau. 
In the conclusion of the introductory essay, Mr. 
Larned says of his work : " I end it with a deep- 
ened conviction that the knowledge of good and 
evil has been complete in the world from the begin- 
ning of history, and that mankind has had nothing 
to learn since but the application of it." The vol- 
ume is appropriately supplied with a full index. 

Users of the "Encyclopaedia Brit- 
tannica " and the " National Dic- 
tionary of Biography" know that 
articles signed by Richard Garnett usually contain 
all upon the subject that can be discovered by a man 
of sound judgment and discrimination who, as Cura- 
tor of Printed Books in the British Museum, has 
had exceptional opportunities. Dr. Garnett has 
also written a good many introductions and maga- 
zine articles, and has published two or three vol- 
umes of poems. Aside from his poems, however, 
his collection of " Essays of an Ex- Librarian "

volume entirely from his pen. The book contains 
a part of his output for the last fourteen years, and 
its subjects range from one " On Translating 
Homer" to one about " Shelley's Views on Art." In 
some of them, especially those on Moore, Matthew 
Arnold, and Emerson, the author shows unusual 
acuteness and ability to phrase elusive discrimina- 
tions clearly. 

BRIEFER MENTION. 



The eight volumes of " Social England," edited by 
the late H. D. Traill, are to be reissued in six much 
larger volumes, revised under the editorship of Mr, 
J. S. Mann, and copiously illustrated in the instructive 
manner made familiar to us by the illustrated edition 
of Green's " Short History." The first volume of the 
new edition has already appeared from the press of the 
Messrs. Putnam, the American publishers, and makes 
us eager to see the others. The text of this work, as 
our readers know, is a sort of mosaic of chapters or 
paragraphs by eminent specialists ; much of this matter 
has been revised for the new edition. The illustrations 
of this one volume are literally hundreds in number, 
and the list of them alone, with a few brief notes, 
fills over thirty large pages of the work. 

The lover of Thoreau wishes, above all else, light on 
the personality of the man; but we cannot say that 
Mr. F. B. Sanborn in " The Personality of Thoreau " 
(Boston : Charles E. Goodspeed) is very illuminating. 
The sketch is extremely brief, and is mostly concerned 
with external characteristics and details, — as in ac- 
counts of Thoreau's house, relatives, and friends. Mr. 
Sanborn's remarks on Thoreau's imitation of Emerson 
are of interest. He sees great similarity, for in- 
stance, in the penmanship of the two, which can 
scarcely be discriminated, but he regards the imita- 
tion as wholly unconscious. Some light is thrown on 
the works of Thoreau, particularly the Journals, and on 
his life ; but we have not the personal study we might 
expect from one who knew Thoreau so intimately. 
The volume, produced at the Merrymount Press of 
Boston, is a fine example of the printer's art. The fac- 
simile reproductions of Thoreau's handwriting, and the 
beautiful photogravure illustration, lend it an addi- 
tional attractiveness. 

The Detroit meeting of the National Educational 
Association was the fortieth annual gathering of our 
chief American organization of teachers. The " Journal " 
of the meeting has now made its appearance, and comes 
to us, as usual, from Mr. Irwin Shepard, the efficient 
secretary of the Association. The proceedings of the 
Chicago meeting of the Department of Superintendence, 
held in February of last year, are also included in the 
present volume. Among its noteworthy features are 
the address of President James M. Green, Bishop 
Spalding's " Progress in Education," Mr. F. M. Crun- 
den's " The School and the Library," Mr. George E. 
Vincent's " Social Science and the Curriculum," Mr. 
E. G. Cooley's " The Gospel of Work," and President 
Hadley's " Use and Control of Examinations." All 
the departments of educational activity are represented 
in the thousand and more pages of this volume, and 
no educator can fail to find somewhere between its cov- 
ers something of peculiar personal interest and value 
to him. 



Notes. 



The " Love Poems of John Suckling " are published 
by Mr. John Lane as a volume of the dainty " Lover's 
Library." 

Mr. William R. Jenkins publishes " En Son Nom," 
which is no other than a French translation of Dr. 
Hale's "In His Name," made by Miss Mary Prince 
Sauveur. 

" Neurological Technique," by Mr. Irving Hardesty, 
is a manual of laboratory practice in a difficult depart- 
ment of anatomy. It is published by the University of 
Chicago Press. 

" Britain and the British Seas," by Mr, H. J. Mac- 
kinder, will be issued at once as the first volume in an 
important geographical library to be known as " Ap- 
pletons' World Series." 

'« Mary Rich, Countess of Warwick, 1625-1678," by 
Miss Mary E. Palgrave, is a new volume in the series 
of " Saintly Lives," edited by Mr. R. F. Horton, and 
published by Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. 

Three more volumes of the •' Temple Bible " (Lip- 
pincott) have appeared. Exodus is edited by Dr. A. R. 
S. Kennedy, Leviticus by Dr. J. A. Paterson, and the 
Gospels of Matthew and Mark by the Dean of Ely. 

" The Bibliographer," a monthly magazine devoted 
to bibliography and rare book news, is soon to make its 
appearance, under the editorship of Mr. Paul Leicester 
Ford. Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. are the publishers. 

" Tales of Past Times " is a volume of " Temple Clas- 
sics for Young People," published by the Macmillan 
Co. The tales are no other than those of Perrault, 
with " Beauty and the Beast " added because it belongs 
there. 

"Four American Inventors," by Miss Frances M. 
Perry, is a book for young readers just published by 
the Werner School Book Co. Fulton, Whitney, Morse, 
and Mr. Edison are the respective subjects of the four 
stories. 

The work on " Chinese Porcelain " completed by the 
late Cosmo Monkhouse just before his death, will be 
issued in this country by the A. Wessels Company. 
The volume will contain numerous colored plates and 
other illustrations. 

To the series of "Modern Plays," of which the 
Charles H. Sergei Co. are the American publishers, 
there has just been added a volume which contains 
" The Revolt " and « The Escape " of Villiers de I'lsle 
Adam, both translated by Miss Theresa Barclay. 

A reprint of Boker's tragedy of " Francesca da 
Rimini " is sent us by the Dramatic Publishing Co., 
Chicago. It is a good-looking volume, and will doubt- 
less secure readers on account of the recent successful 
revival for acting purposes of this sterling tragedy. 

The Messrs. Macmillan are publishing a new popular 
edition of Thackeray, with the original illustrations, 
and " The Newcomes " is the first volume to be issued. 
The use of thin paper brings the upwards of eight 
hundred pages into a volume that is not overswollen. 

Messrs. L. C. Page & Co. publish a translation of 
" The King's Ring," by Zachris Topelius. This is all 
very well, but the publishers are greatly mistaken in 
supposing that they are publishing Topelius for the 
first time in America. Not only " The King's Ring," 
but the entire series of " The Surgeon's Stories " to 
which it belongs, has been before our public in an ad-

mirable translation for upwards of fifteen years, having 
been produced by the enterprise of Messrs. A. C. 
McClurg & Co., and made widely familiar to English 
readers. 

John Richard Green's " Oxford Studies," edited by 
Mrs. Green and Miss Norgate, is a new " Eversley " 
volume published by the Messrs. Macmillan. To the 
same always attractive series the two volumes of Pro- 
fessor Clifford's "Lectures and Essays" have also been 
added. 

In connection with the New Sydenham Society, 
Messrs. P. Blakiston's Son & Co. announce the publi- 
cation of " An Atlas of Clinical Medicine, Surgery, and 
Pathology," selected and arranged with the design to 
afford, in as complete a manner as possible, aids to 
diagnosis in all departments of practice. 

A timely volume on Nicaragua will be published at 
an early date by Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co., under 
the title " Ocean to Ocean." It is written by Lieuten- 
ant James G. Walker, U. S. N., a son of Rear Admiral 
Walker who was in charge of the Nicaragua Survey of 
1898. At the same time Messrs. McClurg will also 
issue a new edition of Mr. Henry I. Sheldon's " Notes 
on the Nicaragua Canal," uniform in style with Lieu- 
tenant Walker's book. 

" The Land of Sunshine," under its new name of 
*' Out West," continues to be what it has been hitherto, 
only " more so." Dominated by the vigorous person- 
ality of its editor, Mr. Charles F. Lummis, it preaches 
with no uncertain sound the doctrine of national 
righteousness. Its belief in the West as the only sec- 
tion of the country in which sound minds in sound 
bodies are possible is insisted upon with possibly too 
much of strenuousness; but the fierce diatribes of the 
•editor against the crowded and effete East are to be 
taken as humorous affectations rather than as serious 
propositions. In its new form, the magazine is more 
profusely illustrated than ever. A fine poem by Miss 
Sharlot M. Hall emphasizes the new departure taken 
by Mr. Lummis and his associates. 

We spoke the other day of the late William Ellery 
Channing as having constituted a link between our own 
age and the past. Our age has been linked to a still 
remoter past by the poet whose death must now be 
chronicled. Aubrey De Vere was born in 1814, and 
became a name in English poetry sixty years ago. 
Since then, upwards of a score of volumes in verse and 
prose have borne that name, and won for their writer 
an honorable place among English men of letters. A 
Wordsworthian in spirit, having also some affinities 
with Shelley, his poetry will richly repay examination. 
Fortunately, we have the volume of selections which 
Mr. G. E. Woodberry made eight years ago, represent- 
ing the poet's work in its variety and at its best. We 
particularly recommend this book together with its 
sympathetic critical introduction. Aubrey De Vere's 
volume of personal " Recollections " will be remembered 
by many readers. Among many titles, the following 
may be named: "The Search after Proserpine," "The 
Legends of St. Patrick," "Alexander the Great," 
" Antar and Zara," " St. Thomas of Canterbury," and 
" The Foray of Queen Meave." 

Just before the last number of The Dial was issued, 
but too late for mention upon that occasion, came the 
news of the death of Horace Elisha Seudder, at his 
home in Cambridge. Even at this late hour we must 
find a few words to say of a man who played an im- 



portant part in the later development of American 
literature, and whose intellectual and moral qualities 
were of the finest type. Aside from the writing of his 
early books for children, Mr. Scudder's work was done 
so unobtrusively that his name was not familiar to a 
very large public. To be the editor of the " Atlantic 
Monthly," as Mr. Seudder was for a number of years, 
is not to be conspicuously in the public eye, but to those 
who know how to recognize real values, it is rather 
more of a distinction than to be President of the United 
States. Many a piece of Mr. Scudder's best work 
went into the magazine, and escaped recognition ; many 
another piece of that work took the shape of editorial 
matter done for some book or new edition published by 
Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co., and few were the 
readers who knew to whom they were indebted. For- 
tunately for his fame Mr. Scudder's last years brought 
him the opportunity of doing one important piece of 
literary work on a large scale and in his own name. 
We refer, of course, to the biography of his old friend 
and neighbor, James Russell Lowell. The more we 
recur to this biography the more are we impressed 
with its judicious use of materials and its constructive 
excellence. For the sake of his literary memory, we 
are glad that Mr. Seudder has left us this magnum opus. 
His personal memory needs no such aid, as far as those 
who were privileged to know him are concerned. It is 
the memory of a scholar and a gentleman, of a clear 
intelligence and an engaging character.

The English Exploration of America 

We are living in a new period of expansion and great changes on 
the map of the world, such as there has not been since the sixteenth 
and seventeenth centuries. It is interesting at such a time to look 
back to the period when our forefathers expanded into this New 
World. The following Old South Leaflets have been added to the series : 

"John Cabot's Discovery of North America," "Sir Francis Drake 
on the California Coast," " Frobisher's First Voyage," "Sir Humph- 
rey Gilbert's Expedition to Newfoundland," " Raleigh's First Roa- 
noke Colony," "Gosnold's Settlement at Cuttyhunk," "Captain John 
Smith's Description of New England," and "Richard Hakluyt's Dis- 
course on Western Planting." 

These leaflets are Nos. 115-122 in the Old South series, which is 
now 80 large. They are made up from original documents of the 
period, and are all accompanied by careful historical and bibliograph- 
ical notes. Sold for five cents a copy, they place at the service of the 
schools and the public a most important mass of historical papers not 
otherwise easily accessible.

PALMER. Personal Recollections of John M. 

Palmer. The Story of an Earnest Life. 8vo, cloth, 

net $3.00 ; delivered, $3.25. 

General John M. Palmer bore a great part in building up the State 
of Illinois. Lawyer, politician, soldier, statesman, his name is " writ 
large " in its annals. He was the friend and associate of all the great 
men whom the people of Illinois have honored and loved, and he was 
worthy of their regard. He bore a part in some of the most important 
political events which have transpired in his State and the nation during 
the last half century, and was intimately connected with the great 
actors who were the human agencies that gave to them historical im- 
portance. His book is dedicated to the people of the State of Illinois, 
and especially to the young men who may feel some interest in the 
struggles of one who earnestly sought in his private and public relations 
to be useful in his day and generation. 

"General Palmer's ' Personal Recollections,' written down by him- 
self near the close of his illustrious career, are replete with an extra- 
ordinary interest and instruotiveness. No one, especially no young 
man, can read this book vrithout being deeply and wholesomely touched 
by this honest, brave-hearted, resolute, and highly typical American"

" It is uo exaggeration to say that uo man living is better qualified to write upon these and kindred

painstaking research, profound learning, and scrupulous fairness and impartiality that have given Mr. 
Bryce's previous works such remarkable vogue among the learned and cultured of both hemispheres. The 
study entitled * Hamilton and Tocqueville ' will undoubtedly possess peculiar interest for American readers."

THE LIFE AND WORKS OF SCHILLER. By Professor Calvin Thomas. With Jive portraits 
in photogravure. 483 pp., 12mo. $3.25 net (postage, 21 cts.). 
Chicago Post : " Worthy to rank with Lewes's "Life of Goethe," . . . ample, accurate, discriminating, though generous of praise, 
and written charmingly ... the story of the great author's life has never been better told. The incidents are woven together deftly, 
brightened with kindly humor and wise comment, yet never obscured by impertinent suggestion or gushes of sympathy. . . . The 
biographer conveys, too, a fine and distinct impression of Schiller's inner nature . . . deals thoroughly with Schiller's numerous pro- 
ductions, a massive pile . . . a notable work." 

ENGLISH ROMANTICISM. By Professor Henry A. Beers. 12mo, gilt top. 
New York Mail and Express: " Among the few really great contribations to the study of Anglo-Saxon literature 
yet made by American scholars." 



XIX. CENTURY. $1.75 net (postage, 15 cts.). 

Book-Buyer : " There is a large feeling of the onward sweep of 
events that is almost dramatic ... it is in making his readers 
understand the spirit of the age that Professor Beers excels. . . . 
As a text-book, it is a valuable summary ; as a book for the general 
reader, it should be found of great interest." 



XVIil. CENTURY. $2.00. 

Outlook : " One of the most important contributions yet made to 
literary history by an American scholar." 

N. Y. Times Saturday Review : "Remarkably penetrating and 
scholarly. It is a noteworthy book by an acknowledged authority 
upon a most interesting period." 

A New Volume of Champlin's Young Folks' Cyclopcedia, 

LITERATURE AND ART. With 270 illustrations. 604 pp., 8vo. $2.50. 

Brief accounts of the great books, buildings, statues, pictures, operas, etc. 

N. Y. Times Saturday Review : " Every schoolboy should have it on his study table. . . . The range of the volume is very wide, for 

besides those items of classical knowledge which constitute the average school encyclopaedia, we have brief descriptions given of modern 

books, poems, inventions, pictures, and persons about which the lad of the period should be acquainted. . . . The pictures in the volume 

are varied and truly illustrative. Old pictures and sculpture are presented in the usual line drawings, but modern scenes and buildings 

are pictured through excellent half-tone reproductions of photographs." 

AMERICAN POLITICAL HISTORY to the Death of Lincoln. Popularly told. 
By Viola A. Conklin. 12mo. $1.50 net (postage, 14 cts.). 
Chicago Post : " The book contains a vast amount of information in a comparatively small space . . . treated in a most interesting 
way . . . there is nowhere a trace of anything in the nature of prejudice or bias." 

N. Y. Commercial Advertiser : "One of those invaluable bird's-eye views of a period which is the essential prerequisite to further 
study, or deeper research." 

Nation : " The style is interesting, and the volume should prove serviceable."

THE CARNE GIE F OUNDATION. 

Rarely has the educational world experienced 
such a thrill as was aroused by the announce- 
ment of Mr. Carnegie's offer to the nation of 
ten million dollars for the establishment of an 
institution to encourage research and the cause 
of learning. As the terms of the endowment, 
the special purposes of the foundation, the se- 
lection of the trustees, the choice of Dr. Oilman 
for the presidency of the institution, success- 
ively became known, the thrill of expectancy 
became a happy assurance that the tidings 
were joyous indeed. 

There is so much aimless and undiscerning 
discussion in regard to educational ends and 
needs and values and methods — and much of 
it unfortunately emanating from high places 
and influential voices — that it is but natural 
that, more than occasionally, men of wealth 
with benevolent intentions become distracted 
amid the clamor of hungry mouths, and in the 
end yet another instance of misdirected phil- 
anthropy is added to a long list. One is often 
tempted, under the inspiration or the irritation 
of so much misguided effort and weakly in- 
vested capital, to favor the appointment of a 
national Director of Philanthropy, and give 
him dictatorial power to shower philanthropic 
millions where the consensus of informed 
judgment believed it to be most potential of 
future benefits. Yet in the light of recent 
benefactions it would be both unjust and un- 
kind to repeat the pessimistic dictum that the 
only good sort of a benefactor is a dead one ; 
far better is the live one who is wise enough 
to invite the cooperation of experienced and 
scholarly men, and to entrust to such men, 
without hampering restrictions or narrowing 
conditions, the supreme task of breathing the 
breath of life into the body corporate which 
the munificent gift supplies. Mr. Carnegie 
has erected a supremely worthy monument and 
inscribed it " To the man who knows ! " Such 
conspicuous recognition of learning as an expert 
art of national consequence is most exhilar- 
ating, — especially in contrast to the more 
general distrust of learning and the thinly- 
veiled condescension toward its professors, 
which a common worship at the shrine of ma- 
terial success has made prevalent.

to encourage investigation, research, and dis- 
covery, to show the application of knowledge 
to the improvement of mankind "; " to increase 
the efficiency of the Universities ... by aid- 
ing teachers in the various institutions in ex- 
perimental and other work "; " to discover the 
exceptional man in every department of study, 
whenever and wherever found, and enable him 
by financial aid to make the work for which he 
seems specially designed his life work "; " to 
secure, if possible, for the United States of 
America leadership in the domain of discovery 
and the utilization of new forces for the benefit 
of man "; — such are the expressed purposes 
of the Carnegie endowment. That they will 
be both liberally and wisely interpreted, and 
likewise vigorously administered, is assured by 
the fortunate selection of the directive head 
of the institution. As president of the Johns 
Hopkins University, Dr. Oilman has exhibited 
two qualities which are most needed for success 
in educational pioneering. He showed his 
ability to discover the real significance and the 
real weakness of an educational situation, and 
steadfastly to adhere with singleness of purpose 
to the chosen goal of his activity ; he recog- 
nized more fully than any other at the time 
the necessity for graduate study in the Ameri- 
can University and the practical possibilities 
of its development. And he showed himself 
peculiarly successful in selecting at a compar- 
atively early stage of their development the 
men of promise who were to be the leaders of 
their craft in the near future. Unlike the 
mother in the play who dismissed the promis- 
ing young men who presented themselves as 
suitors for her daughter's hand in a vain 
search for a man who had his future behind 
him, Dr. Gilman appreciated the stimulus to 
achievement that comes of timely recognition, 
and the assumption of high responsibilities. 
He was willing to follow Mark Twain's philo- 
sophic advice to " put all your eggs in one 
basket and watch that basket." Even more 
fundamental was the recognition thus accorded 
to the vital, though not self-evident, truth that 
men of outwardly equal rank are born and 
develop with conspicuous inequality. To dis- 
cover the exceptional man and to provide him 
with the environment suitable to the richest 
fruitage of his talents, constitutes an invest- 
ment of material and intellectual resources of 
the very highest possible value, whether meas- 
ured by the practical benefits inevitably to flow 
therefrom, by the reflex stimulation of learning 
which it is certain to encourage, or by the 



widespread prestige and appreciation of suc- 
cessful intellectual endeavor which it is likely 
to disseminate. 

Without assuming the uncertain role of the 
prophet, one may recognize in the Carnegie 
foundation a powerful instrument for the ad- 
vancement of learning, and one may anticipate 
eminent success from the wise determination 
of the makers of this instrument to focus it 
upon a specific field of influence. Such a policy 
is far better than the duplication of existing 
resources at the national capital (with its al- 
most inevitable entanglement with political 
aspirations), which the well-meaning enthus- 
iasts for a national University had been so 
loudly advocating. We may interpret Mr. 
Carnegie's assurance that " were Washington 
still with us, his finely balanced judgment would 
decide that, in our generation at least, such use 
of wealth would not be the best " as a patriotic 
tribute to the father of his country ; yet it 
testifies as well to the wise dominance of pro- 
gressive educational principles in the framing 
of the institution that is to be. True is it that 
the plan is an innovation and carries with it 
the element of venture incident to untried ex- 
periments ; yet " he that will not apply new 
remedies must expect new evils, for time is the 
greatest innovator." What we demand of in-, 
novation is that it shall be born of ripe judg- 
ment and bear promise of conformity with the 
natural trend of evolution. An Englishman, 
himself a Conservative, defined Conservatism 
as the unwillingness to adopt a newer way of 
doing things until it was shown to be a better 
way. Under that dictum we should all be Con- 
servatives, no doubt ; yet we should continue 
to differ as to the kind of evidence necessary 
to produce such conviction ; and an unreason- 
able and over-cautious disinclination to venture 
a hazard of new fortunes will ever be charac- 
teristic of some sorts of men. Conservatism 
in education has been a peculiarly hampering 
— though not rarely also a saving — influence ; 
and this, because convention, crystallized tra- 
dition, and worship of the status quo (to say 
nothing of the indolent comfort of a policy of 
laissez Jaire)^ have been such constant and 
potent factors in the history of educational 
reforms. Latterly, our transgressions have 
changed somewhat in character. We are doubt- 
less as ready as is good for us to try new 
methods, to establish new curricula, to discard 
ancient traditions, to bow down before new 
theories and proclaim, not a royal, but a demo- 
cratically short-cut road to learning. Yet to a

discerning and disinterested observer the edu- 
cational hives of industry where these products 
are put together, would seem more like great 
repair shops than smoothly-working and well- 
ordered factories. We putter and fuss and 
talk glibly of growth and improvement, while 
the really vital problems receive neither dis- 
cussion nor any other helpful form of attention. 
It is at such a time, when the few are striving 
with strained vision to foresee and direct the 
next stages in educational unfoldment, that the 
innovator provided with material means and 
intellectual resources finds his opportunity. 
The expressed purpose of the Carnegie founda- 
tion " to promote original research, paying 
great attention thereto, as being one of the 
chief purposes of the institution," indicates a 
serious attempt to remedy one of the great 
deficiencies of our academic organization, and 
to make the devotion to research as a life- 
occupation as well established and as worthy 
in dignity, attainments, and reputation as the 
highest positions devoted to the dissemination 
of learning by teaching. 

The lack of a proper income, the lack of 
leisure, the lack of inducements toward the 
investigative career, the lack of a congenial at- 
mosphere to nurture such devotion to research 
as survives among the professorial and allied 
classes, — these are of a nature all compact ; 
and together constitute one of the most serious 
adversities incident to the academic life in 
America. A partial alleviation of any one of 
these is certain to prove a partial alleviation 
of all ; and it is because the founders of the 
Carnegie institution have recognized in these 
needs a fundamental weakness of the present 
educational outlook, and because they foresee 
the great practical opportunity to administer 
to these needs, that the Carnegie foundation 
must be set down as an event of extraordinary 
consequence. This pronounced defect in Amer- 
ican Universities has naturally not escaped 
notice. It is most forcibly and discerningly 
set forth in Professor Miinsterberg's arraign- 
ment of the dearth of productive scholarship 
in this country (" Atlantic Monthly," June, 
1901) ; and his keen diagnosis of the cause of 
the malady is as wholesome reading as is his 
prescription of the remedy that is to be applied, 
along with the directions for its application. In 
the ordinary course of events public sentiment 
upon this topic would have had to be well 
shaken before the remedy would have been 
taken. The fortunate appearance of Mr. Car- 
negie's devotion will act as a stimulus that will 



at once place the case upon a more hopeful 
footing. It is not well to chill the optimism 
of the friends of the investigative career, or to 
restrain the joyous belief of underpaid and 
overburdened professors that there is a good 
time coming ; yet it is well to remind ourselves 
of the slow growth and careful nurture that 
such ideals require. Not to all who wearily 
climb the hill to see from afar the pleasing 
prospect, will it be granted to enter in and 
possess the promised land. Yet the influence 
of this message of good will to productive au- 
thorship is sure to penetrate far and wide. 

Likewise is it worthy of note that the in- 
vestigative career, and doubtless the mission 
of the Carnegie institution, embraces a far wider 
scope than the application of scientific princi- 
ples to practical arts and inventions. Investi- 
gations likely to reach the self-supporting stage 
without too long or costly an infancy are the 
ones least needful of philanthropic protection. 
When pecuniary profit seems likely, the neces- 
sary " angel " to safeguard the auspicious vent- 
ure is usually, though not always, to be found. 
Far more typical of the career which requires 
fostering care and helpful stimulus is that of 
the scholar in any one of the sciences or hu- 
manities, at present laboring with inadequate 
means and amid distracting obligations, to 
penetrate a step farther into some unexplored 
recess of nature's Africa, to interpret the sig- 
nificance of social and political tendencies, to 
restate for present-day needs some chapter of 
the story of human evolution, or some pertinent 
aspect of the forces that make for culture and 
civilization. " To discover the exceptional 
man in every department of study, whenever 
and wherever found" suggests a pleasingly 
liberal interpretation of the purposes and the 
scope of the investigative career, and gives 
promise of a broad as well as a profound de- 
votion to the cause of productive scholarship. 
And it does more than this : for it recognizes 
that creative industry demands its own condi- 
tions and will not respond to arbitrary demands 
nor imposed conventions. The Muse is coy 
and the Sphinx is dumb ; and success is to wit 
as well as to valor. It is difficult enough under 
most favorable circumstances to direct intel- 
lectual energy into the most profitable channels. 
If we but knew where lies El Dorado surely 
there would be no lack of philanthropic enter- 
prise to equip expeditions for such tempting 
rewards. But as things are, the least and the 
most we can do, is to provide that some future 
Columbus need not go begging from court to

court for a few ships to start him upon his 
voyage of discovery, nor have to encounter the 
growing dissatisfaction and the threatened mu- 
tiny of his crew because the shores of the new 
world are not soon enough in sight. 

Yet last as first, the success of such projects 
as that inaugurated by Mr. Carnegie depends 
upon the individuality of the men who are to 
direct its fortunes. It is men that make a 
University and differentiate one academic 
milieu from another; and next to them, or, bet- 
ter, because of them, the intellectual atmosphere 
in which they live and move and pass on to 
others the lights that they have kept burning. 
The deepest cause for congratulation is that a 
gift so potent for good should have been so 
wisely given ; that with good intentions has 
been united good counsel. For " the greatest 
trust between man and man is the trust of 
giving counsel, for in other confidences men 
commit the parts of life — their lands, their 
goods, their child, their credit, some particular 
affair ; but to such as they make their coun- 
sellors they commit the whole."

MB. PINEBO'S LATEST DBAMA. 



Mr. Pinero, the most conspicuous English dra- 
matist of the day, is a playwright who seeks to say 
something, and who says it with no small amount 
of dramatic technique. He succeeds thereby in 
having his utterance heard by an extremely large 
number of people, and in provoking a good deal of 
sober second thought. The casual first impressions 
of his latest drama have now had time to fade, and 
it may be worth while to put together the impres- 
sions aroused by several hearings of the play. 

The story of " Iris " must by this time be fa- 
miliar to all readers of current dramatic criticism. 
Briefly, it is the tragic downfall of a weak-willed, 
attractive woman to whom the luxuries of life are 
necessities, and the necessities — love and honor — 
are, one had almost said, luxuries. About this char- 
acter is woven an interesting and depressing plot, 
whose structure and doctrine I propose to discuss, 
by way of testing the reality of Mr. Pinero's art. 

Iris, a widow of twenty-six, will lose her fortune 
if she remarries. The suitors whose wealth would 
make this condition insignificant do not move her, 
and the one man who attracts her fancy is a pen- 
niless young fellow, Trenwith, a burden to his rela- 
tions, who have, as a final act of charity, found an 
opening for him in British Columbia. He would 
willingly leave England but for his infatuation with 
Iris, who lets him dance attendance on her, perhaps 
in the hope that through some acquaintance or other 
a good position may yet be found for him. Mar- 



riage is impossible unless conditions change materi- 
ally. Chief among Iris's rejected suitors is Fred- 
erick Maldonado, an immensely wealthy Jew of 
Spanish-American extraction, who, despite his re- 
jection, is at any moment at Iris's call. Beside 
him, Trenwith is but a boy, physically and intel- 
lectually. These three characters are the protag- 
onists, and the dramatic problem is to develop out 
of the obviously unstable equilibrium of the initial 
situation a series of incidents that shall make out 
of Iris's playing with her chances an inevitable ruin. 
This problem Mr. Pinero handles with entire sin- 
cerity and outspokenness, and without vulgarity. 
He has thought out his subject, if not convincingly, 
at least in a way that is fair and above board. He 
has no desire to make vice attractive, any more 
than he has to disguise the consequences of sin. 
Indeed, he has given a striking proof of his sincerity 
in depriving himself of one of the playwright's re- 
wards : he does not once let the curtain go down 
on a situation that tempts to spontaneous applause ; 
and this from a dramatist who, even in a disagree- 
able situation (witness the schne h faire in '* Quex "), 
can keep an audience alert with sympathetic inter- 
est. It is a sacrifice of the continuous effect of 
approval for the sake of the ultimate effect, as if 
Mr. Pinero had said, " I do not care how the play 
is received at any given moment, if I can have my 
audience go away in thought." That effect, at 
least, is secured. 

The play begins with Iris's farewell dinner party 
before she goes to the Continent for the summer. 
Most of the first scene is purely expository : the 
guests tell each other what an attractive woman 
Iris is, and the praises of " our divinity " are scat- 
tered lavishly through the first three acts. So far 
as the play is concerned. Iris does absolutely noth- 
ing to deserve the extravagant eulogies, for in words 
and actions she is not lovable, witty, or sensible ; 
we must take her on faith. It is remarkable that 
so " modern " a dramatist as Mr. Pinero shonld 
revert to the undramatic, old-fashioned novelist's 
trick of telling us how charming his heroine is, lest 
perchance we should not discover it from what she 
says and does. The initial situation is leisurely 
put before us. Iris's friend and man of business, 
Archie (it is mostly first names in the play — there 
are no outsiders), finds occasion to tell Iris that her 
friendship for Trenwith is causing gossip, — scandal. 
She is surprised and pained, but immediately other 
guests enter, and there is talk and more talk. As 
the scene closes, with the guests going down to din- 
ner. Iris holds Maldonado back for a moment and 
promises to become his wife. The real action has 
now begun : Iris is to marry Freddy Maldonado to 
put a stop to the scandalous and false reports. The 
curtain immediately goes up on the same scene ; 
dinner is over. This device of splitting up an act 
into episodes, marked by the dropping of the cur- 
tain merely to indicate the lapse of time, is several 
times effectively employed. The guests are about 
to go. Trenwith begs Iris for a few minutes after 



1902.] 



THE DIAL 



113 



the rest have gone. She tells him that Maldonado 
has asked for the same privilege ; Trenwith per- 
sists ; then she suddenly relents, and tells him to 
come after Maldonado has gone. Alone with 
" Maldo," she repulses his caresses, and tells him 
fairly that she does not love him, and that she can 
only engage to be the mistress of his house, " faith- 
fully and honorably." Maldonado hears her with 
indignant surprise, but impetuously declares that 
he will take his chance. The third episode of the 
act brings Iris and Trenwith together. Thunder- 
struck at her engagement, the young fellow begs 
her to break it, to marry him and go out with him 
to the ranch. Iris is obdurate : she is " not fit to 
be a poor man's wife," she tells Trenwith, speaking 
to him as frankly as she had spoken to Maldo. In 
a sudden passion of despair, Trenwith kisses her; 
and as if carried away by her affection for the 
younger man. Iris writes a hasty word to Maldo, 
breaking the engagement, and cries to Trenwith, 
" Follow me to Switzerland." 

Thus much, with somewhat inert movement, the 
first act has presented. Stated bluntly, the first 
phase of the problem is : given this woman, who is 
fond of comfort, and who is offered an honorable 
choice between love without luxury, and luxury 
where she does not love, she will seek to evade the 
choice, that she may have both of the things she 
desires, even at a frightful cost. The play has re- 
vealed this dramatic weakness, however : Iris has 
pledged her word and then has broken it ; and in 
spite of all the dialogue, one does not fully know 
why she has done either. However obscure her 
reasons may be to her, to the spectator they should 
be absolutely lucid. Instead of using incident to 
interpret character, Mr. Pinero has devoted his first 
act to describing character which is expected to in- 
terpret incident. The slow movement is then a 
structural weakness, and not a too full elaboration 
of a well-arranged scheme. 

The second act, six weeks later, is at Lake Como, 
whither not merely Trenwith, but Fanny Sylvain 
and Croker Harrington, have followed Iris. Fanny 
(an intimate friend of Iris) and Croker (one of the 
several rejected suitors) are practically the Chorus 
of this un-Greek drama ; devoted to their heroine, 
they sing her praises in and out of season ; and in 
default of lyric odes, favor the spectators with epi- 
grams that are the only enlivening features of the 
play. The comparison to the Chorus is not entirely 
fanciful : Mr. Pinero has cut down his real action 
to three figures, and Iris's two devoted friends have 
as their main function only to pass comment on the 
drama of which they are spectators. This office is 
vividly performed in this act, after Iris and Tren- 
with have had a dialogue alone together. Trenwith 
(who does not at any time in the play win the spec- 
tator's sympathy) tries to make a stand : he has 
enough manhood in him to feel that the situation is 
becoming impossible — his small remnant of money 
is disappearing, and the ranch is his only hope ; Iris 
would have him take her money, and when he will 



not, she begs him to delay another month before 
they face the question of the future ; and Trenwith 
agrees. A few minutes that Fanny and Croker then 
have together suffice to emphasize Fanny's dread of 
the gossip that is now on in full cry indeed. Fanny's 
hesitating unwillingness to believe the worst, and 
Croker's impasnioned appeal to believe only the 
best, come to the spectator, who knows that the 
worst is true, as the keenest of dramatic irony. 
This finely balanced scene closes at the re-entrance 
of Iris and her lover. Suddenly, as the four friends 
are at dejeuner. Croker stumbles upon a newspaper 
paragraph that means financial ruin to them all : 
Archie has absconded, after losing all their money 
in speculation. Croker and Fanny are penniless, 
and Iris, the luxurious, has left bat a hundred and 
fifty pounds a year. Upon this desolate group, just 
as the curtain drops, saunters Maldonado, the mill- 
ionaire. This act has been simple and straight- 
forward in its development. The calamity is well 
led up to, and the characters speak without ambig- 
uity. The dramatist has now stated the second 
phase of the problem : a woman who has refused 
poverty with the man she loves, and luxury with the 
man she does not love, and has chosen the hazard- 
ous lot of unwedded love which preserves her lux- 
ury, is deprived of the independent wealth that 
alone made the doubtful position tenable for a 
while. What will she do now ? 

What she does, and what, moreover, she will do, 
the strong third act makes perfectly apparent. Like 
the first act, the third is in three episodes, each 
with its central incident, its controlling emotion, 
and each hurrying on the story, if not irresistibly, 
yet powerfully. First of all. Iris announces her 
engagement to Trenwith. The marriage is not to 
take place at once, for Trenwith is at last to go to 
British Columbia, and is to come back in two or 
three years. But as Trenwith prepares to go, it is 
Maldonado who dominates the scene. His generous 
offers of aid have been refused by each one of 
Archie's victims; it only remains for them to part 
and try their luck as best they may. Wineglass in 
hand Mald<mado makes a long and fluwery speech, 
proposing Trenwith's health and happy return to 
his loving and vivtvLoxis fianc6e. The sneer is well- 
concealed, but it immediately defines Maldonado's 
position AS the disturbing element of the drama. 
The following episode contains the best and also 
one of the least satisfying moments in the play. 
The dawn breaks upon Iris and Trenwith, who have 
put off the final parting until the last moment. 
Through sheer weariness. Iris has fallen asleep, and 
as the watching Trenwith awakens her, she starts 
up to the horror of the cold, rainy dawn, which 
sends all the courage out of her blood. Again 
Trenwith asks her to marry him and come with 
him, and again Iris refui^es, this time because she 
would prove to him that she can bear poverty alone 
and thereby be worthy to become his wife. Tren- 
with does not urge her (he is after all but a puppet 
in Mr. Pinero's hands), and here of course at a 



114 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



critical moment the play is structurally weak. The 
plot demands that Iris and Trenwith shall be sep- 
arated, and the dramatist seems content with any 
reason instead of the one inevitable reason. A rea- 
son, indeed, he takes the trouble to provide, but he 
establishes no connection between it and what has 
gone before. This process of going back only one 
step, instead of creating a train of events, is now 
seen to be the explanation of the structural weak- 
ness of the first act. But this important objection 
waived, the rest of the scene under consideration is 
superb, and rises to a lofty moral tone instinct with 
dramatic quality as Iris cries out to her lover, 
" Remember me always, but forget more than you 
remember — when you come back to me, come as 
to a stranger." The concluding episode of the act 
is quick and decisive. Maldonado offers to Iris a 
cheque-book, which she refuses to accept, but he 
leaves it, asking her to destroy it herself if she will 
not use it. The amount deposited to her credit '' is 
but a few hundreds — or thousands." The first 
cheque is almost immediately drawn. Fanny's 
niece, a young girl who has fluttered through the 
play just to be utilized in this scene, tells Iris that 
Miss Pinsent, who used to be Iris's companion, has 
also been one of Archie's victims. Iris's quick 
sympathy brings the cheque-book into use. The 
step is taken ; when she leaves the house she takes 
the cheque-book with her ; and the spectator fore- 
sees the end. The third phase of the problem, now 
indeed hardly a problem, is phraseable thus : Iris, 
who will risk scandal for the sake of the man she 
loves, is unable to brave the conditions of life that 
such love renders imperative; accident will take 
her whither it will. 

In the fourth act, two years later, the foreseen 
has happened. As Maldonado's mistress. Iris is 
installed in luxury. In this act there is little move- 
ment, and much dialogue, pitiless and resentful, be- 
tween Maldo and Iris. Maldo offers her marriage, 
but Iris scornfully puts off consideration of a step 
that could not rehabilitate her in her own self- 
esteem. Iris's last remaining friend, Croker, enters, 
and Maldo leaves them alone together. One does 
not often see on the stage more pathetic incidents 
than Iris's eager, heart-broken listening to Croker's 
account of Fanny's wedding and the people who 
were there — "I knew them all, I knew them all." 
Croker tells, too, of the return of Trenwith, ignor- 
ant of all that has happened, save that Iris has 
ceased to write to him. The meeting that Iris 
craves is arranged, after Croker's final cry against 
his own degradation to a mere go-between ( Croker 
is by the way the best piece of character portrayal 
in the play); and Maldo who, by a not too ingen- 
ious device of piecing the fragments of a torn letter, 
has discovered the plan, prepares to overhear the 
meeting. The fourth phase, then, is that the wo- 
man has found the futility of luxury and craves 
only her heart's desire. 

In the moving fifth act, Iris tells Trenwith her 
whole story. For dramatic — or rather theatrical — 



purposes the dramatist has kept the spectator ig- 
norant of Iris's downright suffering and abject 
poverty before she fell to Maldonado. However 
effective the story is at this point, its previous sup- 
pression has had the effect of making us judge Iris 
more sternly than if we had known the whole truth. 
This is dubious dramatic art, to sacrifice a sym- 
pathy and then try to regain it by an impassioned 
explanation. The grief-stricken recital does not 
win over the dazed Trenwith. To Iris's cry, " Take 
me back with you ! " he can only reiterate, " I am 
sorry' — extremely sorry," and leave the room slowly 
and with downcast head. Maldonado bursts in, and 
after a fiery denunciation of the woman, drives her 
out into the night. Then he impotently smashes 
some vases, the curtain falls, and the spectator is 
left to phrase for himself the solution of the prob- 
lem. One emerges on the dark and crowded 
streets, half expecting to see the deserted woman 
wandering aimlessly along. Perhaps this is Mr. 
Pinero's meaning ; we are given no other clue. One 
suddenly thinks of suicide as Iris's alternative : will 
she accept it or enter the ranks of lost women ? In 
any event, the solution is tragic. 

When one attempts to find out precisely what 
the play means, he finds his way blocked by the 
dramatist's apparent wavering between the conven- 
tional and the unconventional points of view. This 
prevents the play from declaring a clear moral 
principle. I do not use the term in its conventional 
sense, for morality is too large a thing ever to be 
conventionalized effectively. But I do not see that 
the play stands for any specific idea. Very obvi- 
ously Mr. Pinero does not intend his play to be 
judged by conventional standards ; his Iris is too 
poignant a presentation of character to be regarded 
as a type to be labelled and thus disposed of. The 
author means her pitiful case to be judged upon its 
individual merits ; and yet at the end, is it not the 
very height of conventional morality to take refuge 
in the banal conclusion of punishing the woman and 
letting her two partners in guilt go free ? To my 
mind, Mr. Pinero's remarkable play falls into the 
logical fallacy of insisting on the special case while 
having in reserve only the general verdict. If Iris 
is by nature a vulgar courtesan, only withheld by 
circumstances from the inevitable end, then the 
conclusion is logical ; but every word of the first 
four acts pleads the reverse : if at any moment she 
might fall, so at any moment she might be redeemed. 
In reality, Iris's fall is more accidental than inevit- 
able. To urge that the end happens as it might 
happen in life is to waive the question ; for art has 
hardly the right to make the accidental seem rep- 
resentative. Mr. Pinero uses his art to interpret 
Iris's strange character, but when one expects the 
final word of interpretation, one hears only the 
blunt record. Thus the play leaves its hearers un- 
satisfied, but the disappointment is of a kind that 
an inferior play could not produce.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 



TESTS OP CULTURE. 
(To the Editor of The Diau.) 

I have read Mr. Payne's article, in your issue of 
January 16, on "Recent American Poetry," in which 
he relates a story of Mr. Herbert Spencer, who some- 
where speaks scornfully of the man who is not ashamed 
to be ignorant of the Eustachian tubes, but who would 
blush if caught saying « Iphigdnia." Mr. Payne, com- 
menting, expresses his " sympathy rather than scorn " 
for such a man, adding: "One can be well-educated 
without knowing anything of the Eustachian tubes, but 
ignorance concerning the pronunciation of « Iphigenia ' 
betokens a defect of culture." 

I read this twice to make sure whether the writer 
were in earnest or only practising a little humorous 
aside upon us. If in earnest, then it seems to me his 
own test of culture is of the same ex parte order as that 
which he condemns in Mr. Spencer. It is the literary 
man's definition against the scientist's. Similarly, some 
scholarly divine might tell us that one can be well- 
educated and know nothing about either the Eustachian 
tabes or the right penultimate accent in the word 
Iphigenia, but it is indispensable that one should know 
all about the spelling of Jahweh and the chapter and 
verse where the second writer in Isaiah begins. A 
socialistic writer and reformer would probably reject 
all three of these tests, and declare that that alone was 
true culture which included a perfect knowledge of the 
wage system and how to rescue the submerged tenth. 
The artist would tell us that whatever we did or did 
not know, we must, if we make any pretensions to cul- 
ture, understand the difference between a life-study 
and a drawing from the flat. The musician would say 
we must have a perfect comprehension of the intricacies 
of Brahms and the harmonic subtleties of Wagner. 
And so on! Each has his own definition of what we call 
culture, or of what constitutes an educated man; but 
must we depend upon or be limited to any one of these 
judgments ? Is there not a definition, or at least an 
ideal, larger and truer ? Is culture to be measured 
by one's proficiency in any single branch of human 
knowledge, gathered from books, the study, laboratory, 
or workshop ? Is it not rather to be defined in terms 
of life and human experience, as spiritual energy and 
power ? If this idea seems too wide and vague, cer- 
tainly the others mentioned fall far short of the real 
requirements. 

Emerson told us long ago that culture "kills exag- 
geration, the conceit of our village or city." It also 
kills the conceit of our particular calling or point of 
view. " Man's culture can spare nothing, wants all the 
material." It begins " in the organic effort of Nature 
to mount and meliorate," its end being " to convert the 
Furies into Muses and the hells into benefit." 

All this without disparagement to Mr, Payne, whose 
literary reviews in The Dial are of great value to all 
who read, and one of its indispensable features. I am 
one of many who, in the rush of books from the modern 
press, am quite content he should do a large share of 
my reading for me, especially in the way of present- 
day fiction and poetry, where he is a recognized expert.

POETRY IN POLITICS IN JAPAN. 
( To the Editor of The Dial. ) 
The Japanese are quite like Silas Wegg, — prone to 
drop off into poetry; and this propensity has recently 
displayed itself in a funny way. Baron Kanaguchi, 
Vice-Minister of the Imperial Household, suddenly re- 
signed. That he was compelled to resign was the gen- 
eral impression, which was strengthened by the following 
verses which he composed and published on retiring 
from office: 

"Kako wa kamo, 
Mirai wa mizu ya 
Yuki-botoke. 

"Sarabatote 
Oyeba nigura ya 
Fuyu no hai." 

This may be translated: 

" The past a cloud, 
The future water 
Or a snow-image. 

" Farewell then : 
Driven I flee, 
A winter fly." 

I take pleasure in calling the attention of similarly 
unfortunate office-holders in the United States to this 
poetical method of facing a prosaic matter like com- 
pulsory resignation. Erxest W. Clement.

ANOTHER PROTEST AGAINST "PROVJJN." 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

A correspondent in a recent issue of The Dial is 
annoyed at the growing use of proven for proved. He 
says it is " a distressing perversion " and " a silly affec- 
tation of an unreal archaism." This is serious; and, 
worse still, our leading newspapers and magazines are 
"every week, if not every day," saying proven. He 
very properly remarks that " instruction will have but 
little effect if we are constantly to have before us such 
weighty examples to the contrary." 

Writers and speakers are too apt to imagine that they 
may make new words or modify old ones to suit their 
taste or convenience. They appear to consider words 
only as tools for aiding and expressing thought, and, 
like other tools, subject to change as convenience or 
fancy may dictate. In the fusion of the elements of 
our language the people seem to have helped themselves 
to French and Saxon prefixes, suffixes, inflectional end- 
ings, and other loose word- material, to suit their needs 
and fancy, without strict regard at all times for the 
sanctity of pedigrees or grammatical rules. However, 
the laws of " old English inflectional endings " are 
greater than the people, and must be observed at all 
hazards. 

The dissyllabic form proven seems a little easier to 
say, and sounds a little more euphonious than proved 
with its " V " and " d " following each other without a 
relieving vowel sound between. Proven has, also, grown 
somewhat familiar to us in poetry, and in the Scots 
verdict " Not proven." Perhaps, too, there is to the 
popular mind just a little more of homely strength, a 
little more proof, in proven. However, these slightly 
extenuating circumstances are far from excusing " a 
silly affectation of an unreal archaism."

liORD Chief Justice RTJSSEL.ii.* 



Disraeli, as quoted in the work under review, 
once " described the legal mind as chiefly dis- 
playing itself in illustrating the obvious, ex- 
plaining the evident, and expatiating on the 
commonplace"; and the reported utterances 
of even so eminent a jurist as Lord Russell 
would hardly seem to abate the keenness of 
this thrust. The qualities of mind that insure 
success at the bar are not brilliance, high cre- 
ative genius, or great originality ; they are 
rather common sense, clear-headedness, energy, 
indomitable perseverance, and self-control. 
These latter endowments the late Lord Chief 
Justice possessed in an eminent degree ; and to 
them he added the combativeness, quickness of 
repartee, and the fiery temper, together with 
the impulsive warm-heartedness, that charac- 
terize the true son of Erin. The fact that he 
visited this country on at least two occasions, 
that he delivered the address before the Amer- 
ican Bar Association in 1896, that he pleaded 
the cause of Great Britain in the Behring Sea 
controversy, and was one of the arbitrators in 
the Venezuelan dispute, lend his life an added 
interest for us. 

Charles Russell was born at Newry, County 
Down, in 1832. He was fortunate in his par- 
entage : his father was neither rich nor poor, 
and was warmly attached to his children ; his 
mother was comely in person, energetic, clear- 
headed, and strong-willed, and something of a 
Spartan in domestic discipline. To the mother, 
rather than to the father, Charles seems to 
have owed the qualities that afterwards made 
him famous. In 1838 the family removed to 
Killowen, a beautiful spot on Carlingford 
Lough. After reading law, and after a brief 
career as solicitor in Belfast, young Russell 
decided to fit himself for the English bar. 
First completing his education at Trinity Col- 
lege, Dublin, he hastened to London and en- 
tered at Lincoln's Inn. Called to the bar in 
1869, he threw himself heart and soul into his 
profession. His experience as a briefless bar- 
rister was short : before the close of the year 
he had made 117 pounds, 261 pounds was his 
income for the next twelve months, and after 
that, for several years, he annually doubled his 
receipts. The high- water mark of his pecuniary

prosperity was reached in 1893, when his fees 
amounted to 22,5 17 pounds. In 1894 he was 
appointed Lord Chief Justice, succeeding Lord 
Coleridge who had just died. Before that he 
had held the office of Attorney-General, and 
had been made a Lord of Appeal. He was 
proud to declare himself the first Roman Cath- 
olic attorney-general, and the first Roman 
Catholic chief justice, since the Reformation ; 
and it is interesting to note that Gladstone 
endeavored to have the chancellorship thrown 
open to Catholics for his benefit. A premature 
death terminated his career, at the height of 
his usefulness and while his fame was still 
growing, August 10, 1900. 

His biography, by Mr. R. Barry O'Brien, 
barrister- at- law, a fellow-countryman and co- 
religionist, is sympathetic and highly interest- 
ing. Devoted as it is almost exclusively to 
Russell's professional activity, and written so 
soon after his death, it cannot be pronounced 
the best possible or most authoritative and dis- 
passionate memoir of the man ; but its pages 
breathe his personality, and the narrative moves 
on with all the briskness and breeziness one 
could desire. 

Although he advocated home rule for Ire- 
land, and appeared as Parnell's counsel before 
the Parnell Commission, Lord Russell never 
joined the Irish party, but remained a Liberal 
in politics. Yet no Irishman was ever more 
unflinchingly true to the land of his birth. A 
friend once said to him, " Russell, if you could 
only give up your Irish brogue, it would be 
worth to you at least another 500 pounds a 
year." " I would not give it up," was the 
reply, " for the additional 500 pounds." The 
activity that enabled him to crowd four days' 
work into each twenty-four hours, is illustrated 
in the following : 

" Russell could not sit quietly in chambers. He had 
to do some practical thing. If he [was] not working, 
he was walking. Action was the principle of his life. 
One day he came into the robing-room at St. George's 
Hall, Liverpool. Several members of the Junior Bar 
were standing round the fire. ' Why are you loafing 
about here ? ' he said; * why don't you do something ? ' 
* We have nothing to do,' said the Junior Bar. ' Why 
don't you go to the races? 'he rejoined; ' do some- 
thing, don't be moping.' " 

The allurements of both the green table and 
the green turf were too much for Russell's 
powers of resistance, at least before he had the 
dignity of the Bench to maintain, and he is 
said to have squandered his princely income as 
fast as he made it, and to have been more 
noted for his debts than for his subscriptions

to charitable causes. His masterful, even over- 
bearing, way with judge and jury alike, is well 
shown by an anecdote first published by Mr. 
Charles Mathews in the " Daily Telegraph," 
and quoted by Mr. O'Brien. 

" In Mr. Russell's young days in silk, when the late 
Mr. Justice Denman was going the Northern Circuit, 
just before the rising of the Court, on a warm summer 
afternoon, some very high words were flung from the 
Bar to the Bench in a tone and in a vehemence which 
caused the learned judge to say that he would not trust 
himself to reprove them in his then condition of sorrow 
and resentment, but would take the night to consider 
what he ought to do, and when they met again the 
next morning he would announce his determination. In 
considerable commotion the Court broke up, and on the 
following day it was crowded in anticipation of ' a 
scene,' an anticipation somewhat encouraged by Mr. 
Justice Denmau's entry into Court with if possible 
more than ordinary solemnity, and on taking his seat, 
commencing the business of the day by saying: « Mr. 
Russell, since the Court adjourned last evening I have 
had the advantage of considering with my brother judge 
the painful incident ' . . . Upon which Russell quickly 
broke in with, ' My Lord, I beg you will not say a word 
more upon the subject; for I can honestly assure you 
that I have entirely and for ever dismissed it from my 
memory' — a turning of the tables which provoked a 
roar of laughter in the Court that even the learned 
judge himself could not but join in." 

" When Russell is there," as was once well 
said of him, "the judge isn't in it. Russell 
dominates every one." The intolerance he 
showed toward all stupidity, folly, verbosity, 
and affectation, was voiced in his abrupt ques- 
tion to a pretentious coxcomb : " Have you 
read ' The Newcomes ' ? " " Yes," drawled the 
coxcomb. " Well, you are very like Barnes 
Newcome." But a kind heart underlay all 
this brusqueness. 

One of his " devils " tells a story of legal 
acumen on Russell's part that almost amounted 
to inspiration. Mr. O'Brien gives the incident 
in the narrator's words. 

" I had made a full note for him in a case. He did 
not read the brief himself. He spoke from the note. 
I sat behind him as he was addressing the jury. Sud- 
denly I remembered that I had omitted one most im- 
portant fact. I was horrified. I felt the cold perspi- 
ration running down my back. What was I to do? If 
I interrupted him he would be angry, and if I let him 
close bis speech without niientioning this fact, he would 
be angry too. What was I to do? It was not at all 
an easy thing to pull him up and go into this new mat- 
ter. There I sat still in doubt, while Russell rattled 
along. Gradually he got to the point where this fact 
ought to come in, while I sat undecided, when suddenly, 
to my astonishment, out came in its proper place in the 
narrative the fact in question. I was amazed and re- 
lieved. How did he get it? He had never opened the 
brief — that I knew. As we walked away from Court 
I told him how sorry I was to have left out that fact, 
and what a funk I was in all the time he was speaking. 



He was not a bit angry. He took it very well. * But 
how,' I asked, • did you know it? You never read the 
brief; you had nothing but the note.' ' Quite true, my 
boy,' said he, • but I felt sure it must be so from the 
lie of the other facts.' The courage of the man, his 
faith in himself, amazed me. He felt assured from the 
general bearings of the case, without any special knowl- 
edge, that this particular thing had happened, and he 
said so with complete confidence." 

" What is the punishment for bigamy ? " 
was once asked him, according to report. 
"Two mothers-in-law," was the ready reply. 
But his biographer, we regret to add, discredits 
this story. Se non e vero, e ben trovato. 

The last days of Lord Russell's life were 
darkened for him by the lamentable course of 
events in South Africa. His attitude as pre- 
siding judge at the trial of the Jameson raiders 
— it was his charge to the jury that procured 
their conviction — foreshadowed his position 
with reference to the Boer War. " What a 
terrible business this war is," he writes to Sir 
Edward Frye, " and what ignorance of the 
forces and difficulties to be met ! " And again, 
in another letter to the same : " What a sad 
business this war is ! And what makes it 
worse in my mind is the fact that one does not 
feel assured we are wholly in the right, and 
that it might have been avoided." His high 
official station forbade him to express himself 
freely in this matter, and it was only in guarded 
utterances to trusted friends that he revealed 
his hearty disapproval of his country's course. 
Despite the native pugnacity of his tempera- 
ment, he was always for arbitration rather than 
war, as the proper mode of settling disputes. 
His sense of justice also was too strong to per- 
mit him to countenance a wrong.

The Latest Criticism of America.* 



Professor Miinsterberg's book on " Amer- 
ican Traits " has already been before the read- 
ing public in the shape of articles published 
from time to time in two of our leading period- 
icals. The subject is not new, nor the treat- 
ment profound ; but the author, as a foreigner 
and a professor in one of our most renowned 
institutions of learning, cannot fail to command 
some attention throughout the land. Indeed, 
owing to their racy conversational style and 
entertaining comment upon American customs

and affairs, the articles have been widely read 
and discussed. And small wonder ; for the 
zeal of the social philosopher, and perchance 
reformer, is upon the Professor, and he pro- 
nounces many uncharitable judgments on what 
he regards not as the natural faults of a still 
youthful and essentially struggling civilization, 
but as the failures of one already completed 
to come up to his own, necessarily German, 
ideals. 

In five articles, the author discusses those 
things which are regarded as chiefly at fault 
in this republic, — to wit, the American char- 
acter, American education, American scholar- 
ship, American women, American democracy, — 
matters which now have become world-renowned 
by being dragged through the dreary waste of 
foreign literature and served over again in the 
hash of newspapers. The author picks out in 
these what he regards as representative traits 
of American life, and bends upon them what 
he considers a friendly, yet avowedly not un- 
prejudiced, scrutiny. The result may be fore- 
seen. Except a very few features that may be 
retained, American culture and ideals sadly 
need regeneration. To answer such criticism 
in full would mean writing a much larger vol- 
ume, and a much more thoroughgoing expla- 
nation of the phenomena of our life, than Pro- 
fessor Miinsterberg in his leisure hours, and 
with his limited opportunities for observation, 
has been able to do. The understanding of 
and familiarity with our problems which we 
have a right to expect from our critics. Pro- 
fessor Miinsterberg as yet possesses not, and 
perhaps will never possess, since his point of 
view is essentially foreign to our ideas and in- 
stitutions. However great, in his opinion, is 
the similarity between what is German and 
what is American, this likeness is in fact but 
superficial, while the differences are funda- 
mental. Besides this German point of view, 
which makes nine-tenthsof his criticism worth- 
less as a corrective, the chief fault of Professor 
Miinsterberg's book, and the one most fatal to 
its real value, is his habit of basing his eulogy 
as well as his apology — in fact, his whole 
argument — upon what he calls the typical, 
but which we feel impelled to call the exag- 
gerated or peculiar, character or situation 
found in a particular city or portion of the 
country. For representative purposes, there- 
fore, his material is hardly worth the time 
spent in gathering it. But Professor Miin- 
sterberg strives for brilliancy of effect, not for 
plainness of truth ; hence his book leaves an 



impression of sham earnestness which more 
than anything else serves to discourage and 
offend the sincere observer. 

Professor Miinsterberg comes before the 
public with the confessed aim of creating a 
better understanding between the United States 
and Germany. The way to do this, as the au- 
thor rightly perceives, is to change the mental 
attitude of each nation toward the other, thus 
effecting a juster valuation of the charac- 
ter, ideals, and institutions of each. What 
he may have said to the Germans about 
America is carefully withheld from us; but 
what he wishes Americans to think about 
Germany and the Germans is in plain print 
before us. It is with this purpose in view 
that he so persistently shows us our inferiority. 
All through the book, American ideals and 
institutions are compared with German, and 
the comparison is insistently in favor of Ger- 
many. This may be well-meant and patriotic 
in our author, but we doubt whether it will 
much help the ardent mediator in achieving 
the cordial enteinte which is declared to be the 
purpose of the book. The intelligent American 
who goes abroad makes observations for him- 
self ; and Professor Miinsterberg's enthusiastic 
guidance will not materially alter his view. 
Nor are we quite sure that the German nation 
is in all respects the one to be held up to us as 
a fit object to learn from. In some things, 
Germany may rather learn from America. 
America is not, and has no desire to become, 
a Germany, but to hold its own course and 
solve its problems for itself. Every nation is 
in some way indebted to another ; the debt can 
be easily acknowledged, and the two remain on 
good terms as before. These two nations, 
however, are too different in political position, 
history, and tendencies, to benefit by conscious 
imitation. The social and political problems 
of a state such as Germany, and those of the 
free union suggested and realized by this com- 
monwealth, are of such widely different nature 
that what suits the one is by logical necessity 
almost excluded from the other. To try to 
make them fit together is another instance of 
the gnome running after the moon. 

Taking his articles one by one, there is no 
doubt that our critic's remarks often contain 
much truth. The man must be born blind 
who cannot see that this community has gone 
too far in some respects and not reached the 
medium in others. But what of it? Every 
nation may have this said about it without 
blushing. It is not safe, however, for the out-

sider, who, with his limited observation, does 
not know the secret springs of health within, 
to suggest the panacea. If he wishes to know, 
let him, like Mr. Carl Schurz and others, put 
his shoulder to the wheel of American progress; 
let him attempt with us to work out some of 
our problems, and he will soon see with better 
vision where our difficulties and our failings 
really lie. The old-world standards of the 
good and the right do not fit the magnitude of 
our task, and we are trying to establish new 
standards in keeping with our conditions and 
ideals. To our German critic, this doubtless 
is mere cant ; and because it seems cant, he 
is unable to understand either our men and 
women and their relation to each other ; or the 
inferior degree of our scholarship and the ele- 
mentary character of our public education ; or 
the fact that the word "democracy," like the 
word " constitution," has a different and more 
native meaning in this country than it has any- 
where else. 

In his first article, which serves as an intro- 
ductory chapter, the author is in his most en- 
tertaining mood, as he shows the ridiculous 
exaggerations which the two nations consider 
representative of their respective peculiarities ; 
and he takes pains to dispel the common notion 
that America is altogether materialistic. This 
may be taken as the kindly act of a scholar 
who has been the guest of this country for 
seven years and enjoyed unbounded courtesy 
and facilities for becoming acquainted with 
the true character of this new world. Yet it 
is everywhere clear that the idealism which 
he finds here is not of such fine grain as the 
stamped and approved German article. The 
idealism of which we can boast is, to be sure, 
not so much concerned with profession as with 
realization, — with giving the ideal a pair of 
stout legs on which to walk this earth. Our 
ideal is necessarily that of a commercial nation 
of republican instincts and liberal antecedents ; 
" prosperity and equal opportunities for all " 
is our creed. Hence the surface of our public 
life may easily impress an observer as a 
scrambling mass of hands and mouths yelling 
for booty ; but is there any country of any 
size which does not on fit provocation produce 
a like spectacle ? To Professor Miinsterberg 
it may easily appear that we have sold our 
birthright for a mess of pottage. But below 
the surface is the old, old current of stanch 
belief in the rights of man, a current which 
has not yet become sluggish, but remains a 
swell of enthusiasm such as in Germany, with 



her military regime, is fast dying away. Of 
this feeling, he sees but the fitful outbreak in 
political gatherings ; and it strikes him as 
puerile. Besides, is materialism altogether 
absent from the experience of foreigners who 
" love and admire " Germany ? The quantity 
may not be so abundant, but the quality gen- 
erally makes up for it. 

In his chapters on Education and Scholar- 
ship, Professor Miinsterberg has subjects with 
which he is more familiar, and his points of 
criticism are mostly both sound and well pre- 
sented : our lack of system and thoroughness, 
our inferior educational ideals, and our dom- 
inating mercantile spirit. Yet we are not 
altogether certain that our critic really under- 
stands just what ideals Americans have, or 
what education we are trying to give. The 
multitude of illiterate people that come to 
our country we attempt to make into citizens 
by giving their children equal educational 
chances with those of the best native families. 
Should not Professor Miinsterberg consider 
what an exceedingly complicated matter edu- 
cation on these principles must be, and how 
little old-world systems will avail in the treat- 
ment of a heterogeneous population of such 
magnitude ? Our elective system, too, is 
found to be the source of many educational 
sins. But he overlooks the fact that our 
institutions, which accord equal rights to 
everybody, must also give to the individual 
the privilege of choosing the line of work best 
adapted to his temperament and natural gifts. 
With us, it is not the State that paternally 
decrees, but the commonwealth that leaves the 
choice with the individual. And the same 
principle which demands that the individual 
shall have this right, demands also as a further 
consequence that whether bright or dull, rich 
or poor, laggard or industrious, he shall lack 
no opportunity, no care, no pains on the part 
of the teacher to help him to see what his needs 
and adaptabilities are, and to have him learn 
what he set out to learn as fast and as effect- 
ively as possible. It should be no wonder that 
under these conditions we have many educators 
but few scholars. So long as this burden of 
bringing up new millions every year to the 
level of intelligent membership of a free coun- 
try remains with the teacher, so long will his 
whole energy be consumed in his work. For 
this side of the educational labor, with its en- 
ormous responsibility. Professor Miinsterberg 
has little sympathy ; yet the devotion to this 
democratic ideal of benefitting each for the

[Feb. 16, 



ultimate good of all has caused generation 
upon generation of students and scholars to lay 
aside their ambitions and obediently perform 
their task till they are ground to powder in the 
educational mill. Such an article of faith may 
very likely seem something like nonsense to a 
foreign and unsympathetic observer, but on it 
is founded our national greatness. The typical 
higher school of Germany and the Gymnasial- 
lehrer have no counterparts in this country ; 
but we doubt whether the educational ideal, 
after all, is higher there than here. 

In his fourth article, on American women. 
Professor Miinsterberg has done what, with his 
uncertain grasp of our institutions, he could 
least afford to do : he has censured the edu- 
cated American woman, despite his flattering 
comments on her individual charm, as being 
nothing less than a social supeifluity, an article 
of luxury, if not a danger and a nuisance. Of 
course. Professor Miinsterberg is here, as else- 
where, especially thinking of our beloved Bos- 
ton, which is rich in women of culture, ambition, 
capacity, and often leisure as well. In Boston 
there are plenty of women who do not marry, 
who go to lectures instead, or pursue profes- 
sional careers; and these, by mere force of 
numbers, have given him the impression that 
in America all culture is in the hands of wo- 
men, while men are ousted from some of their 
especial offices. Hence it is time for our social 
reformer to call a halt, and remind us of the 
true woman on the other side of the water, 
who knows she is but an appendix and makes 
no special claims for herself. Yet, judging 
from recent events, we might imagine that this 
German woman wishes to be in the clothes of 
her American sister rather than otherwise. In 
speaking of the equality between the sexes, 
which he declares Nature never admits, our 
critic has been guilty of a trifling mistake in 
the use of words. Nature certainly admits 
equal forces and influences, though not similar 
functions. We think it is due to a true under- 
standing of the difference between "equal" 
and " similar " that American life has assumed 
its varied aspect and that the American woman 
in her professional capacity can make her influ- 
ence felt as she does. It is not strange that 
men of Professor Miinsterberg's type should, 
after some trifling with the matter, be anxious 
to have women kept properly within the bound- 
aries of domestic exclusiveness. But the rea- 
son why they should strive to get beyond these 
bounds is undoubtedly their inborn right to 
strive for whatever intellectual prizes their 



capacity may reach. The law of Nature, which 
has assumed constantly greater significance in 
the human mind and stands behind all demo- 
cratic institutions, allows women an entire 
right to develop their faculties. Where slavery 
is abolished and serfdom an anomaly, the su- 
premacy of one sex over the other is also obso- 
lete. Professor Miinsterberg's light nonchalant 
treatment of this subject is at best but an imita- 
tion of the raillery prevalent in certain circles 
of American university life ; yet such circles 
represent not the progressive but the reaction- 
ary element in our national life. Furthermore, 
the woman of whom he has so much to say is 
not the American woman as America knows 
her, but a species peculiar to but a small sec- 
tion of the whole vast area. Yet it is worth 
remembering that these very women seek a 
college education and enter a professional ca- 
reer for purposes that honor themselves and 
the civilization that fostered them — a civili- 
zation which is, above all, ethical, as distinct 
from the aesthetic, the practical, or the phil- 
osophical, of which European countries may 
boast. There is something beautifully sug- 
gestive of the ultimate fulfilment of our dem- 
ocratic ideals in the hand-in-hand progress of 
our men and women toward a truer and com- 
pleter life and a nobler and freer society than 
the warlike traditions of the old world have 
created. 

The concluding article, on Democracy, ap- 
pears to us to carry the least weight of all the 
chapters in the book. Though we have an 
occasional laugh at the writer's drollery, we 
regret that he can so little succeed in making 
his view convincing. Somehow our critic no- 
where truly realizes that we have traditions 
underlying our life as powerful as the traditions 
to which he refers as so superior. The good 
and the evils of this commonwealth are based 
upon the same thing — individual liberty ; 
and this sacred right we are not minded to 
give up for any time-honored device, however 
glittering. In Germany, if we may be so bold 
as to make a comparison, the individual, his 
wishes, his personal happiness and rights, are 
not factors to be much taken into account, but 
rather to be subjected to the welfare of the 
structure of which he is but an infinitesimal 
part. It is the State which alone has liberty, 
power, wisdom, needs ; and the individual par- 
takes of these only in so far as he is in harmony 
with the State. Professor Miinsterberg has a 
truly B)'zantine conception of the excellence 
of the omnipresent and omniscient government 



1902.]

which protects, trains, utilizes the individual 
for its own ends, but otherwise lets his life run 
in the established narrow groove. When read- 
ing his praise of the institutions of the father- 
land, it may occur to one to ask in what manner 
the German institutions reward the individual 
for the sacrifice of his identity. The almost 
daily growth of the socialistic party in that 
country is the surest sign that the individual 
does not look upon himself as so greatly bene- 
fitted after all. The marvellous iron scaffolding 
of officialism in Germany, however efficacious 
it may be in holding the four corners of the 
building together, cannot prevent our seeing 
the big crack from top to bottom. But Pro- 
fessor Miinsterberg's view of all these matters 
is the traditional and confirmed von ohen her ah 
attitude characteristic of the remoteness of 
university men of the semi-official upper classes. 
In studying American conditions the author 
sees not, what is only too visible, that our 
shortcomings are in the main faults of youth 
rather than of innate inferiority. As a nation 
we are still in the formative stage ; yet we are 
working not after the old models but toward 
new ones based upon our own peculiar require- 
ments. Professor Miinsterberg may be for- 
given for forgetting this, since his brief Ameri- 
can life has been spent in the oldest centre of 
American culture ; but this does not exonerate 
him from the charge of recklessness in pub- 
lishing his ill-considered views, and thus in- 
voking a criticism which must necessarily be 
as severe in tone as many of his statements 
are crude and flippant. 

In conclusion, we may be permitted to ask : 
Would Professor Miinsterberg, if he lived in 
London or in Paris, be found lecturing the 
English or the French as from Boston he has 
lectured the Americans ? Max Miiller stayed 
at Oxford for half a century ; but no one ever 
heard of any attempts on his part to reform 
the English, their educational methods, the 
characters of their men and women. Friendly 
criticism and admonition should neither be 
disdained nor resented ; but we believe that 
America can and must work out her own sal- 
vation, with little aid from foreigners who 
understand neither our people nor our institu- 
tions ; and whose criticisms, wholesome as they 
might be for us in some respects, lose their 
effect and value by reason of their unsym- 
pathetic point of view and the air of self- 
complacent superiority with which they are 
uttered.

Theories of Life and Conduct.* 



Mr. Hugh Black's latest book, "Culture 
and Restraint," should have a wide reading. 
It is an exposition, well thought out and sys- 
tematically presented, of two methods of attain- 
ing the highest good, — the method of self- 
expression and the method of self-repression, 
and of the relative merits of each. Since 
everyone must in a measure act according to 
one of these two methods, an understanding of 
wherein each is good and wherein each fails is 
of prime importance. 

The ideal of culture is the healthful outgoing 
of all human activities. These suggest and 
determine the life which man was meant to 
live ; let him therefore live that life naturally 
and fearlessly. The soul has room for all the 
world of beauty and of knowledge which man 
has conquered. Culture insists upon the duty 
of seeking the fulfilment of all human possi- 
bilities, of attaining and preserving health and 
integrity in every sense, of ripening all our 
powers to maturity. Our business, in the words 
of Bishop Blougram, is to " make the absolute 
best of what God made." The aesthetic ideal 
saves its follower from vulgar standards, by 
showing him " that there are larger things in 
the world than getting on, and more worthy 
things to worship than the great goddess of 
prosperity." It saves him, further, from pro- 
vincialism and narrowness of interest ; it brings 
wideness of outlook and catholicity of taste. 
It broadens the judgment and helps its follower 
to avoid one-sided views and hasty and preju- 
diced conclusions. It corrects the vanity of 
ignorance and gives true balance, or poise. 
Yet this ideal, in spite of its great value, has 
in the long run, taken by itself, always failed, 
not only in making life nobler and sweeter, 
but even in keeping true to its own best self. 
The effort to get the most out of life, to acquire 
the richest experience by " ever curiously test- 
ing new opinions and courting new impres- 
sions," is apt to lead to the old philosophy of 
a short life and a merry one. Judged by the 
highest ethical standard, too, the man who 
makes self-culture his absolute ideal cannot be 
acquitted of selfishness ; an illustration of this 
is seen in Goethe. This theory of the conduct 
of life fails, on the whole, because it takes a 
shallow conception of the needs of man and 
the world. 

The other theory of life and conduct (for 

* Culture and Rkstraimt. By Hugh Black. Chicago : 
Fleming H. Revell Co. 



122 



THE DIAL. 



[Feb. 16, 



which " restraint " is too mild a word) is that 
of the ascetic. Self-control, moderation, avoid- 
ance of excess, are all good, even necessary to 
any scheme of life ; but the extreme type of 
self-repression, or asceticism, fails even more 
signally than the method of self-culture, since 
it is prohibition which does not prohibit, which 
cannot prevent ; since, instead of removing, 
it only creates, temptation. Sacrifice, as an 
end in itself, " is the barrenest and the most 
dangerous object man can set before him." In 
the teaching of Jesus, rightly understood, Mr. 
Black thinks that both culture and sacrifice 
are reconciled and made reasonable by the 
thought of service. " A man's contribution 
to society will mean all the riches and resources 
of his nature, his heritage of race, and personal 
capacity, and education." 

Such, in brief, is Mr. Black's thought. We 
cannot agree with all of his conclusions, — as, 
for example, that to define evil as simply the 
imperfection involved in finite being destroys 
the moral view of evil ; we regret, too, that he 
80 persists in speaking in the now meaningless 
terms of a worn-out theology. Still, with his 
main line of reasoning and with his general 
conclusion we find ourselves in complete accord.

Thomas's liirE of Schiller.* 



Two such works as Francke's on German 
Literature and Thomas's Life of Schiller, with- 
in five years, are not only creditable to a pub- 
lishing house, but they are an index of the 
advanced stage of American scholarship in the 
study of modern literatures as compared with 
a generation ago. Then Longfellow, Hedge, 
and Lowell, as interpreters who had their 
knowledge at first hand, were exceptional schol- 
ars in the modern languages, who knelt while 
they burned incense to the rulers on the German 
Parnassus ; and Germany was almost a land 
of romance. For nearly a score of years, how- 
ever, study abroad has been a matter of course 
for those preparing to enter collegiate work in 
philology and literature, since the sources and 
the authorities were formerly all foreign. But 
a time has come when Americans may regard 
the best of their own scholars with complacency, 
knowing that they are the peers of the best 
scholars abroad ; and when we may declare the 
fact that it is no longer necessary to go abroad 

* The Life and Works of Fbiedbich ScHiiiiiBK. By 
Calvin Thomas. lUastrated. New York : Henry Holt & Co. 



to secure the best instruction in literature and 
philology. Not that travel and study abroad 
are no longer desirable ; they will always be 
so, since the great manuscript stores are still 
in Europe, and since, moreover, contact with 
a variety of minds and methods will always be 
among the foremost elements of culture. 

Professor Thomas is most widely known as 
one of the best of " Faust " editors. His in- 
terests have b.een supposed to lie chiefly with 
Goethe, wherefore the announcement of his 
Life of Schiller caused some little wonder. 
And in his Preface the author frankly admits 
that there was a time when his attitude toward 
Schiller was scarcely so sympathetic as to war- 
rant undertaking to write his life, " when my 
mind was very hospitable to demonstrations of 
his artistic shortcomings." But he adds : 
" Time has brought a different temper, and 
this book is the child of what I deem the wiser 
disposition." 

It has been said that every good poem is a 
self-revelation. Perhaps the same observation 
applies to every product of a man's activities. 
Certainly it holds good in the case of this Life 
of Schiller. For the treatment of nearly every 
phase of Schiller's activity contains, as it were, 
strata from the earlier and the later stages of 
the author's thought. Doubtless this was Pro- 
fessor Thomas's plan ; but in any case the 
outcome is most advantageous for his readers, 
since they are thus presented with a more 
evenly balanced view of the favorable and the 
unfavorable estimates of Schiller than could 
have been produced by one who had always 
held to either side of the unfortunate Goethe- 
Schiller contest. The result is, indeed, when 
both the favorable and the unfavorable opinions 
are vigorous and when they appear in close 
juxtaposition, an apparent inconsistency of 
judgment, but stubborn consistency is one of 
the worst vices in a critic. 

The self-revelation of our author lies in 
the conflict between his critical judgment and 
the spontaneous tribute of his heart to the 
noble mastery of the poet's art. After all, 
Schiller and Goethe are touchstones for the 
spiritual and philosophical tone of those who 
deal with them. The one-sided realist will be 
repelled by Schiller, and just as surely the in- 
tense idealist will recoil from Goethe. But 
those who have, by turns or by fits, both ideal- 
istic and realistic sympathies, will find pleas- 
ure accordingly in both of the great Germans, 
and may even learn to see realistic leanings in 
Schiller and idealistic strivings in Goethe. 



1902.] 



THE DIAL 



123 



And as the one or the other of these tendencies 
prevails in the student, even so is he inclined 
to yield precedence to one or the other of the 
poets. In general it is true that the critical 
temper is in sympathy with realistic methods, 
but the wide world loves an idealist. Criticism 
at first undertakes to tell us what we ought to 
admire ; in time it learns to be satisfied with 
explaining why we admire what we do admire. 
And so Professor Thomas approaches Schiller. 
" For the poet who wins the heart of a great people 
and holds it for a century is right; there is nothing 
more to be said, so far as concerns his title to renown. 
The creative achievement is far more precious and im- 
portant than any possible criticism of it. This does not 
mean that the critic is in duty bound to abdicate his 
lower function; — it means only that he will be best 
occupied, generally speaking, in a conscientious attempt 
to see the man as he was." 

Over and over again Professor Thomas him- 
self sets the example which he commends in 
speaking of Die Jungfrau von Orleans : 

" It was a great deed of poetry, in the presence of 
which a right-minded critic, after duly airing his little 
complaints, as critics must, will be disposed to doff his 
hat and say Bravo! " 

The appreciation of the poet is all the more 
grateful and convincing because it comes so 
often almost grudgingly, despite the theoretical 
condemnation. We may take as illustration of 
this, and at the same time of other features of 
Professor Thomas's work, his treatment of Die 
Jungfrau von Orleans, — "a tragedy in 
which he proceeds still further along the path 
of romantic idealization, proceeds indeed so 
far that one can no longer follow him without 
some rather serious misgivings " (p. 372). 
Yet on page 375 we find : 

" A dramatist is justified if his intention is good and 
he succeeds in it. . . . His experiment was received 
with ecstacy at its first performance and has ever since 
held its place in the affection of German play-goers. 
They are not troubled by its irrationalities, but receive 
them with pious awe, as Schiller intended. For the 
reader, too, ' The Maid of Orleans ' has a deep and per- 
ennial fascination. Theorize about it as we may, it is 
a great popular classic, which has exerted an enormous 
educative influence, and proves how thoroughly its au- 
thor knew the heart of the German people." 

And then he proceeds to theorize on page 378 : 
" As the play stands, however, it must be allowed 
that the demand made upon the imagination is quite 
too severe. The love-incident is preposterous in itself 
and a mere episode at that, serving no purpose finally 
but that of picturesque contrast. It is a sort of thing 
which one can put up with very well in a romantic 
opera, but not so well in a serious drama." 

And further, on page 378 : 

"It is difQcuIt to justify such a scene upon any 
theory of poetic art." 



At this point Professor Thomas undertakes to 
explain that such scenes (as that between 
Johanna and Lionel) are tolerable in " Lo- 
hengrin " but not tolerable in a serious drama, 
because in the first case they are within the 
limits of tradition, and in the second not. But 
inasmuch as nine-tenths of the average audi- 
ence do not know the details of the tradition, 
the application of the distinction is not evident. 
However, let us continue our quotations. 

« It is really quite futile to discuss the artistic rea- 
sonableness of this scene. If one likes it and is touched 
by it, very well; but a prudent poet might well have 
had some regard for the very large number of people 
who would find such a scene ridiculous rather than 
touching." (P. 379.) 

And yet on page 382 we read : " It [Z)ie 
Jungfrau von Orleans] was a great deed of 
poetry," etc., as already quoted. But on the 
next page : 

" It must be admitted that a heroine who excites in- 
terest chiefly by virtue of her patriotic sentiments and 
the bravery of her conduct does not represent the 
highest type of creation. The muse will always lend 
virtue and bravery to any common poetaster for the 
mere asking; but she does not so readily vouchsafe a 
convincing semblance of human nature." 

But on the other hand, on page 384 : 

" Shall we then take refuge in the position that the 
Maid's story is not adapted to dramatic treatment at 
all ? Such a position is at once rendered absurd by the 
perennial popularity and effectiveness of Schiller's play. 
Until some great realistic poet shall prove the contrary 
by deeds, the mere critic is certainly justified in holding 
that, whatever may be thought of his love-episode, the 
ghost and the miraculous escape from bondage, the 
general requirements of the theme are best met by 
Schiller's romantic treatment." 

On the page after this, we find the following 
anent the minor characters of the play : 

" In short, the characters of « The Maid of Orleans ' 
leave much to be desired on the score of verisimilitude. 
One has the feeling all along of being in an artificial 
world made to order by an imaginative fiat. To enjoy 
the play it is necessary to put aside one's rationalism 
and surrender oneself to the illusion one knows that 
the author wishes to produce. ' The Maid of Orleans ' 
does not compel the surrender, like * Wallenstein '; 
one must meet the poet half-way. That done, however, 
everything is in order, for the technique of the play is 
faultless." 

Finally, speaking of the end of the second act : 
" One who is not touched by this portion of the play; 
who does not return to it with ever renewed pleasure 
after each sojourn in the choking air of naturalism, 
is — to state the case as gently as possible — unfortu- 
nately endowed." 

After a series of such passages, we can 
imagine a reader asking in despair : "But what, 
then, is Professor Thomas's opinion of ' The 
Maid of Orleans ' ? " Is it not evident that he 



124 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



has various opinions of it? And who that is 
honest has not? One impression the reader is 
sure to get : that despite all technical defects, 
it is a great piece, and that Professor Thomas, 
like other good Germans, finally doffs his hat. 

One whose allegiance to Schiller and idealism 
has been unwavering might be satisfied with 
this tribute, but for a few traces of the old 
patronizing attitude, such as, " Unquestionably 
Goethe at his best was a far greater poet than 
Schiller"; "Goethe's was the rarer genius"; 
" The other and higher method, as exemplified 
by Shakspere and also by Goethe "; " It is not 
to be denied that his (Schiller's} poetry at its 
best is seldom supremely good "; "Unquestion- 
ably Schiller lacked the supreme qualities that 
go to the making of a great world-poet "; and, 
most exasperating of all, " A distinctly human 
Johanna, — such as Goethe might have given 
us had he turned his thoughts in that direc- 
tion ! " Where is the use, please, and where 
the grace, in still insisting that " one of the 
real immortals " is less great than another? 
Why not have let it stop with the generous 
Goethe's own words : " They ought rather to 
be glad that they have two such fellows " ? 

A few mildly unfair criticisms might be 
pointed out. For instance, in the discussion 
of Schiller's ballads, page 320, it is mentioned, 
seemingly as a reproach, that " not a smile is 
provided for in the whole list." Pray, do we 
expect to smile over ballads ? How many 
smiles are provided for in " Lenore " and " Der 
Erlkonig," or in our old English ballads ? 
But the same reproach against " Wallenstein," 
page 353, " Humor plays no part," is hardly 
warranted by the fact. Not to mention the 
" Lager," which is probably intended to be 
excluded from consideration here, Tiefenbach 
and Isolani in " Piccolomini," IV., 6, are not 
wholly without humorous touches ; and Isolani 
at the close of II., 6, " Wallenstein's Tod," 
certainly compels a smile. The dickering of 
Buttler with the murderers in " Tod," V., 2, 
has also some rather grim fun in it. 

Professor Thomas's style deserves comment. 
It is certainly clear and forcible. But it is 
more than that. It is distinctly individual. 
There is in it at the same time the freedom of 
conversation and the vocabulary of omniverous 
reading. It makes the difference between the 
handbook and the work of literature which this 
Life of Schiller actually is. We have already 
quoted too much to feel free to cite more in 
illustration of the vigor and unconventionality 
of the author's expression. The following brief 



tale of rare or unlisted words will prepare the 
intending reader for surprises : interjacent, 
strumous, cicisbeo, bewray, dubiety, cunctatory, 
operose, monodistich, religiosity, vulgarian, 
revenant, ineluctable, pococurantism, arach- 
nean, feaze. 

The fulness of the yet incomplete biog- 
raphies of Minor and Weltrich could not be 
rivalled (perhaps happily !) in a single volume, 
and some side of the subject had to come short. 
Undoubtedly Professor Thomas acted wisely in 
taking space for full literary discussions at the 
expense of petty biographical details. 

The student of German literature will find 
in this book the most helpful of material : clear 
and adequate abstracts and statements of Schil- 
ler's plots and purposes ; the frank and orig- 
inal utterances of a man of virile but refined 
taste regarding the times and the man ; an 
extraordinary variety and fairness of view 
taken all in all ; and a genuine enjoyment of 
the poet's masterpieces which will prompt to 
reading at first hand and to re-reading for com- 
parison. It is not only an indispensable mem- 
ber of the library of every student of German 
literature henceforth, but it deserves a welcome 
from the wider public of general culture. The 
publishers have given the work a worthy dress 
in the dignified volume, with its solid paper, 
clear print, and valuable illustrations. 

Typographical and kindred errors are almost 
wholly lacking. "The Lost Son," page 41, 
should be " The Prodigal Son." On page 141, 
" gratification " would be clearer as " benefit." 
Page 189, for " lacrimose," read "lachry- 
mose." Page 229, the word " century " has 
been inadvertently omitted at the bottom of 
the page. Page 376, for " Althougn," read 
" Although." On page 429, for " The Bloody 
Marriage [Bluthocbzeit] at Moscow," read 
" The Massacre at Moscow." For " rodoman- 
tade," page 449, read " rodomontade."

It is a disagreeable task to criticize a book 
which has been heralded by its publishers and

bution in its field : it is still more disagreeable, 
when the author of the book is a brilliant and

criticism. 

It is true that the title which Mrs. Tweedie 
has selected for her book saves her from a 
great deal of criticism. One can hardly find 
fault with a simple narrative of what an author 
sees on a journey. And when Mrs. Tweedie 
really confines her attention to what she saw 
in Mexico, she is interesting and on fairly safe 
ground. She saw some phases of Mexican life 
uoder exceptionally favorable circumstances. 
The President of the Republic was interested 
in her work ; governors, and their representa- 
tives, exerted themselves in her behalf ; rail- 
road officials extended to her every courtesy ; 
foreign residents vied with each other in show- 
ing her attention ; the best native Mexican 
society extended that gracious and beautiful 
hospitality which it knows so well how to 
offer. In describing these attentions and the 
places and things which they opened to her 
inspection, Mrs. Tweedie is interesting and en- 
tertaining. 

But outside of the simple narrative of her 
own experience Mrs. Tweedie's book is value- 
less. As a contribjition to knowledge of Mex- 
ico, it not only has no worth, — it is often 
misleading. We need not search for evidence 
of this ; it may be found by simply opening 
the book anywhere. To show how fundamental 
her ignorance is, one example suffices. Mrs. 
Tweedie sees but two types in Mexico, — the 
Spaniard and " the Indian." Yet neither the 
Spaniard nor the Indian is much in evidence 
in the greater part of the country through 
which Mrs. Tweedie travelled. The cowboys 
of Northern Mexico and the common people of 
the cities of the high tableland are not Indians, 
though Mrs. Tweedie so styles them. The true 
Mexican of the highland, is the mestizo. Mrs. 
Tweedie seems never to have seen the name : 
true, at one point, when quoting (without ac- 
knowledgment) she misquotes the word, mak- 
ing it nestizo, and defining it as " a performer 
of witchcraft"! The word, however, is the 
common term applied to mixed- bloods. 

That Mrs. Tweedie misprints her Spanish 
at times is excusable. We all do so, but while 
it is unfortunate, it does no great harm. We 
have but tried to write words as we heard 
them. But the case is different with Aztec 
words. These are gathered from reading, and 
we ought to be able to copy them from the 
printed page quite exactly. But our author 
mis-spells Aztec words often. Thus she writes 
hoyote (coyote), dahali (javali), and aquacate 



(aguacate), and speaks of the god Fenecatl 
(Ehecatl) and the ruler Ahuistotl (Ahuitzotl). 
This list of mis-spelled words leads us to Mrs. 
Tweedie's remarkable statements in natural 
history. She speaks of howling wolves, and 
says she is " well acquainted with their music 
and appearance " — yet describes them, under 
the name " boyote," as "small like a fox"; 
the little peccary or javali (her " dabali ") is 
said to be the " wild boar " ; the aguacate, she 
says, " is a vivid green lemon used in salad " 

— yet she has eaten aguacates ; we are told 
that " the lion and the panther " live along 
the Tampico branch of the Central Railroad, 
and might naturally infer that the lady is 
speaking of two animals, instead of one. Mrs. 
Tweedie is probably the only person who has 
seen " beautiful birds of paradise " in Mexico. 
She certainly had an unique experience on the 
tropical river, where " a taper (sic) peered 
upon us from a bough." 

But Mrs. Tweedie's natural history, peculiar 
as it is, does not surpass her ethnography and 
archaeology. These are sometimes observation, 
and sometimes quotation from or reference to 
authorities, whom she knows so little that she 
cannot read their names after her notes are 
cold. She visited a " cruciform cross " in the 
neighborhood of Mitla ; in the same region 
she saw walls of " natural stones, — adobes 
(the native sun-burnt brick)" ; in Oaxaca 
Valley, she found, what will astound the best- 
informed ethnographers, stone-tipped arrows 
shot with blow-guns, — as she says : "A man 
will fashion his arrowhead in a few minutes 

— five at most — and with his long reed blow- 
pipe and stone head fixed to his arrow shoot 
with no uncertain aim ! " (The exclamation 
mark is fortunately in the text ; it saves the 
reviewer trouble.) In one picture Mrs. 
Tweedie represents a man in a " grass coat 
made from cactus," and in the text identifies 
the species of cactus as the " palm cactus "; the 
coat is not a grass coat, nor is it made of cac- 
tus, nor is chere a palm cactus. 

But Mrs. Tweedie is at her worst in refer- 
ring, with an air of familiarity, to authorities 
in archaeology and ethnography. Poor Seler 
will hardly recognize himself as Eeler. Bel- 
mar's list of Oaxacan languages is almost un- 
recognizable, with five out of the thirteen 
names mis-spelled. And what can we say of 
her commendation of archaeological books, — 
her list of the best ending with " Sandelier 
Medaillac's ' Prehistoric America.' " Poor 
Bandelier's book dropped out of the hastily

the Marquis de Nadaillae ! But that Sandelier 
Medaillac was as nearly correct as Mrs. 
Tweedie knew, is clear from its having gone 
through the proof-reading and appearing in 
full in the index. 

We should find the statements regarding 
social and economic conditions quite as unre- 
liable, but we will not say more. We regret 
that Mrs. Tweedie did not do a little serious 
study, if she cared to go at all outside of her 
subject — " Mexico as I Saw It."

The Scope op Faith,* 



Such a breaking ont of religious belief as we now 
witness has never before been seen. It is the burst- 
ing of a cloud which fills old channels and makes 
many new ones. A freedom is in the air, as when 
the buds of Spring are everywhere pushing. 

The work on *' The Passing and the Permanent 
in Religion," by Dr. M. J. Savage, expresses this 
liberty in its exultant form. The style is clear and 
popular, the thought is sober and just, and the au- 
thor walks with joy amid the sudden shifting and up- 
ward trend of events. For him the salvage con- 
tains the vital centre of every living thing. If the 
author does not always touch bottom, he makes a 
manly effort to do so, and leaves the deep spaces 
for the rest of us to fathom as best we may. 

" Life Everlasting," the last work of John Fiske, 
has the author's usual lucidity, and somewhat more 
than his ordinary rhetorical force. The argument 
is just, though it by no means reaches the full 
ethical energy of the theme. It is what can be 
soberly said in view of physical facts, rather than 
what can be justly drawn from our own inner life.

The religious views of Mr. Fiske have had a some- 
what fictitious importance attached to them because 
he was so early and profoundly imbued with the 
opinions of Mr. Herbert Spencer. Those who have 
never been equally burdened by a philosophy so 
spiritually barren are tempted to say, " How this 
empirical creature is creeping heavenward! It is 
interesting." 

" Two Centuries of Christian Activity at Yale " 
is a work chiefly written by Professor H. B. Wright. 
The narrative is clear, succinct, and instructive. 
Professor Wright is supported by a variety of au- 
thors on special points. Many will enjoy the book, 
and Yale men will find it especially interesting. 

" The Hearts of Men " is the title of a peculiar, 
not to say a queer, book. In style it is a reiterated 
question ; in substance it is a series of unqualified 
affirmations. Its colors are white and black ; there 
are no grays. It presses hard on dogma in a most 
dogmatic temper. It attacks reason with a long 
and closely compacted argument. Yet the book is 
interesting and instructive. It has at bottom one 
profound truth, which needs constant enforcement, 
— that religion is a thing of feelings even more 
than of thoughts, and demands our sympathetic 
apprehension in every form in which it offers itself. 
In the spiritual world, knowledge flows into feeling 
and feeling into knowledge with a pulsation which 
leaves neither significant without the other. If the 
author had presented his views with more propor- 
tion and qualification, he would have rendered bet- 
ter service. 

We unite the three volumes entitled " Science 
and Christianity," " The Doom of Dogma," and 
" Is Christ Infallible and the Bible True ? ". because 
they are all so extreme in their views, and, looked 
at as a product of Christian philosophy, so pathetic 
and so wearisome. They are the fruit of much 
thoughtfulness and patient labor, and yet they lead 
us to no sufficient results. Taken together, they 
nullify each other. Two are made up of extended 
and opposed criticism, and the third of minute and 
ineffectual defense. " Science and Christianity " 
seems to be written by one who holds fast to tra- 
ditional beliefs, and is more successful in accumu- 
lating material than in making use of it. The book 
is fitted to leave two impressions strongly : the 
closeness of the limits of knowledge, whether that 
knowledge pertains to religion or science ; and the 
readiness with which we fall into excess of asser- 
tion, whether on the physical or the spiritual side. 
We carry a flickering torch in a cavern ; we catch 
glimpses, lost as quickly as obtained. The author 
is keenly sensitive to the over-confident temper 
with which the new theology of science is urged, 
but does very little to help us out of the darkness. 
He fulfils his function in repeatedly declaring how 
dark it is. The author of " The Doom of Dogma " 
is equally fertile in criticism, but aims at the de- 
struction of dogma, not at its retention nor its re- 
statement. The criticism is extreme rather than

sober. That men of active minds should reach 
results so unfruitful, is not comforting. Rashly 
pushing forward and obstinately holding back are 
alike ill-timed. One does not wish to stand between 
books which express so earnest a phase of individ- 
ual lives and any readers they might otherwise 
secure. The first volume will bring to the reader 
many weak points in current theological specula- 
tions, and lead him to feel that current beliefs and 
unbeliefs are not so free of difficulty as they seem 
to be. The second volume will give him, in nearly 
four hundred pages, a great variety of criticisms 
which have accumulated against traditional beliefs, 
and leave him to make what way he can among 
them. The third volume will furnish him, in nearly 
seven hundred compact pages, an exhaustive and ex- 
hausting defence of the essentially infallible charac- 
ter of Scripture. Neither of the three volumes seems 
to us to grasp the true intent of dogma, as offering 
transition steps in intellectual and spiritual unfold- 
ing. The ultimate result of the destructive criti- 
cism seems preferable to that associated with ortho- 
doxy. The author of " The Doom of Dogma " 
affirms, though in an extravagant form, the unity 
of nature, of man, and ot God. The world is one 
and coherent. The author of the third volume 
reaches the conclusion of a conflict between reason 
and revelation, and the necessity of a choice be- 
tween them. We can hardly be surer of any one 
thing than of unity in God's work and method. 

The work on " Theology at the Dawn of the 
Twentieth Century " covers a wide field. It is 
made up of many brief contributions of men of 
ability and prominence, who represent a large vari- 
ety of opinion. It is sure, therefore, to have points 
of interest for an equally wide range of readers. 
Though the themes considered are principally doc- 
trinal, they include a few of a practical character, 
as " Divorce and Re-Marriage," " Religious Condi- 
tion of the Anglo-Saxon Race," etc. It is the pro- 
gressive rather than the conservative element that 
is represented in the book, the attitude of the more 
thoughtful men rather than of the masses. It is 
the midway point among thinkers that receives em- 
phasis. Those who stray, either by holding back 
or pushing on, fail of representation. The book is 
a snap-shot at the head of the column. Mr. Fred- 
eric Harrison follows an analytic introduction by 
the compiler with an essay on " Christianity at the 
End of the Nineteenth Century." It seems to us 
unduly pessimistic. Mayor Jones, in one of the 
closing articles on "The Religious Condition of the 
Working Men in America," strikes a clearer and 
more cheerful note. The volume would have been 
more satisfactory if the practical side of Christi- 
anity had received more attention. There is no 
recognition of the Labor movement, which has 
sprung up under the second great command, and 
has been more revolutionary of social sentiment 
than any other event in the century just closed.

Briefs on New Books. 



The fallen 
Stuarts and 
their influence. 



Mr. F. W. Head is the author of a 
scholarly monograph entitled " The 
Fallen Stuarts " (Macmillan), treat- 
ing of the services rendered to various European 
states by the several Pretenders to the English 
throne. The book is an elaborated essay which 
was presented for and won the Prince Consort Prize 
in 1900. Necessarily the character of the study 
involved, as well as the regulations of the prize 
contended for, required that the author should pro- 
duce a scientific detailed treatise, enumerative of 
minute historical incidents, rather than a readable, 
popular book. Not that " The Fallen Stuarts " is 
unreadable, for Mr. Head has done much to illumi- 
nate an exceedingly dry subject; but its concise 
statements, and rapid reviews of connecting inci- 
dents preclude any general interest other than that 
of the close student of history desirous of examining 
the results of recent and specialized research. As 
a monograph, Mr. Head's book takes high rank, for 
it is accurate, exhibits thorough study, is replete 
with references to the best authorities, and is logi- 
cal in arrangement. By far the greater portion of 
the work is devoted to the international rather than 
the insular influences of the Stuarts. The accounts 
of their attempted invasions of England are but 
briefly related ; while their relations with foreign 
monarchs, and their reception at foreign courts, are 
dwelt upon at greater length. Thus, in illustration 
of Mr. Head's thesis, the exact use to which Louis 
XIV. wished to put the first Pretender, James II., 
the effect of the latter's presence at Versailles upon 
French international policy, the motives actuating 
the treatment accorded his royal refugee by the 
King of France, occupy all of the author's at- 
tention to the exclusion of events and conditions in 
England attendant upon the revolution of 1688. 
In like manner, very little space is devoted to noting 
the influence exerted, by the mere existence of the 
Stuarts in exile, upon the internal development of 
English church and state. The author's thesis is, 
in short, the influence of the Pretenders upon for- 
eign policy in Continental Europe, and this ground 
he has covered with a scientific detail that renders 
his book a valuable if not a very interesting addi- 
tion to the historical literature of the period. An 
appendix of thirty-five pages contains illustrative 
extracts from the Gualterio Manuscripts at the 
British Museum.

ing the results of archaeological discovery and of 
estimating their bearing on the great question of

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



the origins of Greek civilization. In the substan- 
tial voluaie before us, Mr. Hall has thrown together 
his notes made during the course of some years' 
study of the problems of " Mycenean " archaeology. 
How modern the study of these fascinating ques- 
tions is, can be appreciated only by those who know 
that twenty-five years ago our knowledge of Greek 
history could hardly be said to have extended much 
further back than the beginning of the seventh 
century B.C. In Mr. Hall's words, '• The Homeric 
period seemed to be entirely inolated ; an impassable 
gap separated the Greece of Homer from the Greece 
of Herodotus ; and behind Homer lay impenetrable 
darkness." Schliemann's energy and enthusiasm, 
and the scholarly appraisal of his discoveries by 
cooler intellects, have, partially at least, raised this 
veil, and enable us in these early days of the new 
century to formulate working hypotheses which are 
successively more and more persuasive. Mr. Hall 
remembers, and reminds his readers, that we are 
not beyond the region of hypothesis. His own ex- 
planation of the phenomena he admits to be pro- 
visional ; but it is consistent with the facts, and is 
elaborately wrought out. He assumes, as to date, 
that the rich and varied civilization called *' My- 
cenean " was already nearly universal in Greece 
and had entered upon the period of its fullest de- 
velopment in the sixteenth century B.C.; and he 
believes that the Homeric civilization, traditionally 
dated to the ninth century B.C., was a decadent 
form of that of Mycenae. Below the relics of the 
Mycenean (or Bronze) age, are found those of 
the " Pi SB Mycenean " or copper age, which dates 
roughly about 2000 B.C. As to the curious and 
beautiful art-work called " Mycenean," Mr. Hall 
does little beyond repeating the conclusions and 
reproducing the illustrations of such works as Perrot 
and Chi piez's great ^isioire. Schuchhardt's "Schlie- 
mann," and Tsountas and Manatt's " The My- 
cenean Age." His most original and elaborate 
work is done in tracing the lines of ethnic connec- 
tion between Mycenae and the Archaians, the 
Egyptians, PbcBuicia, Cyprus, and Crete. The 
book is not for the general reader, nor even for 
the intelligent layman who is not acquainted with 
the previous literature of the subject. Its appeal 
is to the scholar who can weigh its arguments and 
estimate its conclusions. It is well printed and 
bound, and abundantly supplied with indices, ap- 
pendices, charts, and illustrations. 

The founder ^^^ removed as the spirit of our 

of the order modem life is from that of the 

ofst. FraneU. founder of the » Brothers Minor," 
the story of so sincere a life, told with sympathetic 
directness, is not without its measure of appeal for 
a reader jaded with the tinsel glories of a popular 
novel. Mr. James Adderley's " Francis, the Little 
Poor Man of Assisi " (Longmans) is a brief but 
very finely appreciative study of the man and his 
influence upon his age. For the ordinary reader, 
the chapter on " The Times of Francis " might well 



have been a little longer. The generalizations with 
which it is mainly filled should have been supple- 
mented by particularizing details or illustrations, 
which would have saved the background against 
which the figure of the saint is seen from the hazi- 
ness that more or less obscures the significance of 
the man himself. But, with this reservation, it is 
a very bright picture that the lover of men and of 
all God's poor and lowly things makes in these 
pages, from the time of his idle, flaunting youth, to 
the hour of his death, when " with his songs were 
mingled those of the little birds he loved so well." 
Useless as seems now much of the self-abnegation 
that made up his life, the telling of it here reveals 
a most engaging personality, a sweet and inspiring 
faith. The story of the stigmata, the appearance 
of the marks of the crucifixion on the body of 
Francis, Mr. Adderley tells in quotation from the 
Fioretti, thus escaping the necessity for expressing 
an opinion himself. The very beautiful frontispiece 
of St. Francis sho,ws in the hands and the feet the 
marks of the nails. The book closes, sadly enough, 
with a showing of the return to worldliness of the 
Franciscans themselves, even during the lifetime of 
St. Francis. 

Lincoln ^^ these days of scientific research, 

among hit and of application of iconoclastic 

coniemporarie*. methods to history and biography, a 
life of Abraham Lincoln on old-fashioned lines 
seems unusual reading. The underlying thought of 
Dr. Robert H. Browne's "Abraham Lincoln and 
the Men of his Times " (Jennings & Pye) is, that 
the great war president was a chosen agent of 
Providence, a man for his time designed to meet a 
special exigency, just as Moses or Luther, Cromwell 
or Washington had been, each in his particular 
period of history. This idea appears everywhere 
throughout the twelve hundred pages filled with 
anecdote, reminiscence, and record of personal ex- 
perience. The author's father, a Scotch engineer 
who settled in Springfield, Illinois, in the middle of 
the last century, was a close friend of Stephen A. 
Douglas, and the son grew to manhood in a com- 
munity which witnessed many of the everyday 
scenes in the life of great actors on the ante-bellum 
stage. At a later time he became identified with the 
fortunes of Mr. Lincoln as a worker in the cause of 
the new Republican party, and had the best of op- 
portunities to know those who secured the nomina- 
tion for the " Illinois rail-splitter " at Chicago in 
1860. This event is the culmination of the author's 
story ; and a very interesting story it is, showing 
from the standpoint of an Illinoisan the forces 
which were at woik during the ten years before the 
war developing the man for the time. That things 
do not simply " happen " in politics, but come to 
pass according to deliberate plans carefully worked 
out, is clearly shown by Dr. Browne. There is a 
vast amount of local coloring in this account of the 
environment surrounding Abraham Lincoln from his 
birth to his death, and also a good deal of the cur-

rent history of the country needed to illastrate his 
life ; the resulting impression being that desired by 
the author, of a Providential leader coining into the 
kingdom at exactly the right time. 

In this age of innumerable " process 
methods" of pictorial reproduction, 
in which the sun and the kodak are 
usually the artists, it is refreshing to see a collec- 
tion of honest old-fashioned lithographs in black 
and white, and to find in them some " artistic feel- 
ing " as well as some skill in drawing. So we are 
grateful to Mr. Thomas R. Way for having chosen 
lithography as his medium for depicting the " An- 
cient Royal Palaces in and about London " (John 
Lane). His twenty-four plates illustrate thirteen 
palaces, or surviving portions of palaces, includ- 
ing Eltham Palace, Greenwich Palace, the Tower, 
Crosby Hall, Savoy Palace, Whitehall Palace, St. 
James's Palace, Kensington Palace, Kew Palace, 
Richmond Palace, Hampton Court, and Windsor 
Castle ; Buckingham Palace is omitted because of 
its lack of age. It might be doubted if lithography 
is the best pictorial method of presenting architec- 
tural details ; but Mr. Way has certainly been very 
successful in grasping the picturesque features of 
some of his scenes. His subjects have not in all 
cases been inviting ; Americans who have never 
been in England will doubtless be surprised to see 
how unpalatial some of these royal palaces are in 
their external appearance, — Kew and Kensington, 
for example. Mr. Way's pictures are accompanied 
by architectural, antiquarian, and historical notes, 
of great value and of deep interest, by Mr. Fred- 
eric Chapman. From these notes we may learn, 
for example, why it is that we speak of our '' am- 
bassador to the Court of St. James." St. James's 
Palace was once the hospital of St. James the Less, 
And retained its saintly name long after it was 
transformed into a royal abode ; and it still retains 
the name, though it is now no longer a royal abode, 
but is yet admirably adapted to Court ceremonials.

five pages, printed on fine paper with liberal 
margins. The edition is limited to fou^ hundred

AnindUpensahie "Correct Composition," the second

and much-needed manual *■'■ intended to give infor- 
mation about the correctness of type-setting, which 
is not minutely taught in English grammars or 
clearly explained in technical manuals of printing." 
It is designed for the use of not only the printer 
and proofreader, but for all who are concerned in 
the production of the printed page. It has to do 
no less with the proper preparation of " copy " by 
the author than with its proper reproduction by 
the printer ; and, indeed, it is the author who is 
most in need of such instruction as the book affords. 



Writers for the press are too apt to assume that 
the niceties of punctuation, capitalization, com- 
pounding of words, and other essential details of 
correct composition, are the concern of the printer 
only. Careless and slovenly " copy " is too often 
the rule rather than the exception, as every printer 
and magazine editor knows. No writer, whatever 
his degree of experience, could fail to profit by 
Mr. De Vinne's concise and common-sense precepts 
and well-chosen examples. An invaluable feature 
of the volume is an appendix giving a list from 
which may be seen at a glance the variations in 
spelling, among the seven standard English dic- 
tionaries, of over sixteen hundred words. We 
should like to see a copy of Mr. De Vinne's book 
not only in every American newspaper and printing 
office, but in every school and college library as 
well. The result could not but be a distinct advance 
in the prevailing standards of literary composition.

his field and has set forth only such principles as 
must needs be known to the practical draughtsman, 
pointing the students of the theory and science of 
perspective to a completer work which already 
exists for them. In his Preface, Mr. Longfellow 
advances the opinion that "the practice of per- 
spective depends not so much on many principles 
as on the varied applications of a few," an opinion 
that is shared generally by perspective draughts- 
men. But to the knowledge of a few general 
principles and the power to apply them must be 
added a fine sense of perspective to save the 
draughtsman from running into serious complica- 
tions. The "feeling" for perspective is something 
that no book can supply, and the more finely this 
sense is developed in a draughtsman the less does 
he consciously depend on principles. Mr. Long- 
fellow's book will help the general practitioner, for 
it not only shows how principles are applied prac- 
tically, but it illustrates their application by photo- 
graphs from art and nature. The Introduction 
contains material of interest to others than archi- 
tects or painters, — indeed, to everyone who would 
view a picture intelligently ; while the explanation 
of the horizon and its varying relation to the ob- 
server as he changes his base, and its fixed relation 
to him no matter how he changes, is very sugges- 
tive. The work contains seventy-five drawings in 
the text, and thirty-three full-page plates, many 
being in half-tone. It fills well its own field.

effort to treat the subject from a social standpoint, 
and thus has produced a very convenient handbook 
regarding the " Pennsylvania Dutch." The reader 
finds interesting details about the way in which the 
oppressed peoples were attracted to America, now 
by a translated pamphlet by William Penn, now by 
the influence of a letter from an old friend or by 
the conversations of a returned colonist sent back 
to Germany to lead others to the land of peace, or 
again by some wily agent of a transportation com- 
pany. The privations of the journey and the toil-

the certain improvement in temporal condition and 
the moral and social influence upon the new country. 
An attempt is made to show what the race has done

are made without partisan prejudice or special 
pleading. A liberal use of footnotes permits the 
introduction of many brief items of interest ; a bib- 
liography indicates the growing literature regarding 
the general subject ; and in the appendix is to be 
found a discussion of Pennsylvania-German family 
names with annotations of much value. On the whole 
the little volume is the most complete and inter- 
esting for the general reader that has yet appeared 
about this element of the pioneer population of the 
United States. A list of more than one hundred 
and fifty titles shows something of the literature of 
the subject, and also suggests again the earnestness' 
and zeal with which in recent years the claims for 
the minor elements of our colonial population are 
being advocated. 

Literature in " ^^^ Earlier Renaissance " (Scrib- 

Buropeinthe ner) belongs to the series entitled 
early 16th century, u Periods of European Literature," 
and edited by Mr. George Saintsbury. It is the 
fifth volume in the serial order, and the seventh in 
the order of publication. The editor is in this case 
also the author, as in the case of the volume on 
"The Flourishing of Romance," which has the 
second place in the series. The period of the new 
volume is roughly the first half of the sixteenth 
century, which assigns to it the names, among many 
others, of Erasmus, More, Ariosto, Machiavelli, 
Politian, Rabelais, and Hans Sachs. The opening 
chapter, called " The Harvest-Tide of Humanism," 
discusses the Latin writing of the period. From 
this the transition is easy to the Italian vernacu- 
larists of the Cinquecento, thence to the French 
epoch here styled " From Rhetoric to Pleiad," 
thence to the Elizabethans who were (mainly) be- 
fore Elizabeth. A chapter on German literature 
then follows, then studies of early dramatic and 
critical writing, and the work ends with a few ran- 
dom notes on Scandinavian, Dutch, and Slavonic 
authors. The book has all the familiar character- 
istics of Mr. Saintsbury's work ; it is exasperating 
in style, but gives evidence of enormous reading. 
It is as even in execution as one has a right to ex- 
pect, and in point of accuracy is not open to serious 
criticism. 



For some prominent men of the past, 
■^'^ortii/eof ^ complete biography in the com- 
pass of a magazine article seems an 
absurdity; but for the dashing Paul Jones, Mr. 
Hutchins Hapgood's little life in the "Riverside 
Biographical Series" (Houghton) is sufficient for 
all readers except special students. This is due to 
the skill of the writer, who has been able on this 
small canvas to paint a complete picture of the 
man, and to set forth in sufficient detail his bril- 
liant and important work for his adopted country. 
We have him here, with his burning ambition, hi» 
reckless but well-calculated daring, and his profes- 
sional skill. He is thus summed up : " As far 
as his deeds are concerned, Paul Jones appears 
in the popular consciousness as he really was, — a 
bolt of effectiveness, a desperate and successful 
fighter, a sea captain whose habit was to appear 
unexpectedly to confound his enemies, and then to 
disappear, no one knew where, only to reappear 
with telling effect. He has been the hero of the 
novelists, who, expressing the popular idea, have 
pictured him with essential truth. A popular hero, 
indeed, he was, and will remain so, justly, in the 
memory of men."

THE DIAL

tial volume, " Uncle Sam, Trustee," a serious study of 
present conditions and problems in Cuba, by Mr. John 
Kendrick Bangs. The book will appear in April. 

A new " Eversley " volume, published by the Messrs. 
Macmillan, is a second edition of Professor R. C. Jebb's 
" Modern Greece," which contains two lectures, written 
over twenty years ago, but still pertinent as to the 
essential aspects of their subject. 

"A Text-Book of Applied English Grammar," by 
Mr. Edwin Herbert Lewis, is published by the Mac- 
millan Co. It is an elementary school book for the 
upper grades, brief and practical, as are all of the text- 
books of this experienced teacher. 

A very charming " Whist Calendar," published by 
Messrs. Noyes, Piatt & Co., is designed by Miss Mil- 
dred Howells. Her decorative work is fetchingly 
artistic, and her textual extracts, although brief, pro- 
vide a pleasant surprise for nearly every page. 

«« Who 's Who " for 1902, being the fifty-fourth year 
of the issue of this useful dictionary of living English- 
men, comes to us from the Macmillan Co. As hereto- 
fore, the biographies include a few Americans, although 
the selection of names seems to have been made after 
a haphazard fashion. 

Mr. William R. Jenkins is the publisher of " A 
Course in First Year Latin," by Mr. W. W. Smith. 
The work is prepared especially for students who ex- 
pect to take the Regents' Examination in New York, 
but would not be out of place as a text-book, intro- 
ductory to Caesar, in any high school. 

" Asinette," is a French story for English children, 
written by Mrs. J. G. Frazer. It has the Dent im- 
print, and is published in this country by Messrs. E. P. 
Dutton & Co. Eight charming colored plates, and a 
great number of marginal cuts, help to make this vol- 
ume exceedingly attractive to a young reader. 

A dainty pocket edition of " The Pilgrim's Progress " 
is issued in the " Caxtou Series," of which Messrs. 
Charles Scribner's Sons are the American publishers. 
The two volumes are well printed, bound in limp blue 
lambskin, and supplied with photogravure frontispieces 
and other illustrations from the clever pen of Mr. E. J. 
Sullivan. 

" The Gospel Story of Jesus Christ," by Miss Ida 
W. Hutchinson, is a pretty book for young people, pub- 
lished by Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. Another book 
from the same source is " My Island," a volume of 
stories for children, by Miss Eilian Hughes. Both of 
these books are manufactured in England by Messrs. 
J. M. Dent & Co. 

Messrs. Knight & Millet are the publishers of a 
volume of "Studies of Trees in Winter," by Miss 
Annie Oakes Huntington. The work is scientific in 
method, although not without an occasional sesthetic 
touch, and is abundantly illustrated. Professor Charles 
S. Sargent contributes an introduction, and thus stands 
in a way as sponsor to the book. 

" Modern Design in Jewellery and Fans " is the sub- 
ject of this year's special winter number of «' The 
Studio" (John Lane). The text consists of a half- 
dozen brief essays on the present condition and tenden- 
cies of these branches of artistic craftsmanship in 
France, England, Austria, Germany, Belgium, and 
Denmark, contributed by art-workers in each of the 
respective countries, the whole being edited by Mr. 
Charles Holme. As in all " Studio " publications, the . 
illustrations are notably profuse and well-executed; 



there are nearly one hundred and twenty-five in all, 
including eighteen in colors, forming together a most 
interesting exposition of the subject. One of the plates 
is a beautiful stencilled fan design printed in colors 
upon white silk. 

Mr. Joseph B. Mayor's " Chapters on English Me- 
tre " has for many years been one of the best books 
upon its subject to be had in our language. A new 
edition, with three added chapters, has now been pre- 
pared by the author, and is published by the Macmillan 
Co. The metres of Shelley, the recent theories of Mr. 
Bridges and Dr. Skeat, and the hexameter in English, 
are the subjects of the new chapters. 

Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons import for the Amer- 
ican market the fourth edition, revised and enlarged, 
of " A History of Architecture on the Comparative 
Method," by Messrs. Banister Fletcher and Banister F. 
Fletcher. The work, now contains 256 full-page plates, 
one-half of which are photographic representations of 
typical architectural monuments. 

The latest modern language texts are the following: 
"A German Reader and Theme- Book" (Holt), by 
Professor Calvin Thomas and Mr. W. Addison Hervey; 
Schiller's " Die Jungfrau von Orleans " (Appleton), 
edited by Professor Lewis A. Rhoades; Freytag's " Die 
Journalisten" (Appleton), edited by Mr. Thomas Ber- 
trand Bronson; Schiller's "Die Braut von Messina" 
(Silver), edited by Professor William H. Carruth; 
Storm's " Immensee " (Ginn), edited by Mr. Richard 
Alexander von Minckwitz and Miss Anne Crombie 
Wilder; "The Elements of French Composition" 
(Holt), by Mr. J. Howe Cameron; " Une Semaine k 
Paris " (American Book Co.), a book of conversations 
prepared by Mr. Edwin F. Bacon ; " Les Forceurs de 
Blocus " (Appleton), by M. Jules Verne, edited by Mr. 
C. Fontaine; and "A Spanish Anthology" (Silver), 
containing lyrics from the thirteenth to the nineteenth 
centuries, and edited by Dr. J. D. M. Ford. 

The section on the History of Mediaeval and Modern 
Literatures of the International Congress of Historical 
Sciences, whose third biennial session will be held in 
Rome next April, has as yet a very limited American 
membership, and therefore is seeking to enlist the 
further interest of American scholars in its work. To 
this end a special American committee has been ap- 
pointed, whose secretary is Dr. J. E. Spingarn, Columbia 
University, New York. It is hoped that all American 
scholars interested in this field of study will secure 
membership in the section. The membership fee of 
twelve francs may be sent to Professor Francesco No- 
vati, 25 Via Borgonuovo, Milan, Italy. The publica- 
tions of the Association are sent to all members. The 
papers of this section at the Paris meeting of 1900 fill 
a volume of some three hundred pages under the title, 
" Annalea Internationales d'Histoire: Congi^s de Paris, 
1900. 6me Section: Histoire compar^e des litt^ratures" 
(Paris, 1901: Armand Colin). It is also hoped that 
original contributions within the field will be offered 
for presentation at the coming Congress from Amer- 
ican scholars. American scholarship has its own point 
of view and has its own contributions to make in the 
study of literary history. The reciprocal advantages 
of closer relations with the representatives of European 
scholarship are manifest. The project is being con- 
sidered of trying to induce the Congress to hold its 
next meeting (in 1904) in some American city. Amer- 
ican cooperation at this year's meeting will be sure 
greatly to further this design.

Adventures in Tibet 

By 
WILLIAM CAREY 

Large 8vo, cloth. Superbly illustrated. 
$1.50 net. 



MORE than half the book is occupied by a description of 
the most mysterious country in the world, a title which 
Tibet well deserves. The concluding portion is the diary 
■written by Miss Annie R. Taylor, that very wonderful woman, 
who, unaided and almost alone, made the famous journey 
throngrh the heart of the forbidden land. Every page is 
crowded with thrilling interest. 



United Society of Christian Endeavor 



Indeed a wonderful and moving atory. — Louttville Courier-Journal. 

The story reaches its climax in the trial scene near Lhasa, where for 
fifteen days, Miss Taylor stood at bay, fighting for her life and the lives 
of her two Tibetans. — Chicago Record- Herald. 

This book takes right hold. I took it as I do a novel, without stop- 
ping. It is a fresh wind from a far country, a relief from the monotony 
of some things American. The heroine of the story is Miss Taylor, 
and such grit ! When you read the story, you will say, " this is the 
pluckiest little woman of modern times." I think she would reach the 
North Pole if she should head that way. — Orapho in The Advance. 

That a woman should have passed the mountain passes, overcoming 
hunger and cold, gained the good will of the wild tribesmen among 
whom she was thrown, beat off or escape the attacks of robbers, and 
penetrated almost to Lhasa, the sacred city, and finally returned to 
her starting point, after seven months spent within the frontiers of 
Tibet, is little short of marvellous. — Public Opinion.

The Colonials 

By ALLEN FRENCH 

WHEN we announced THE COLO- 
NIALS by Allen French, we took it 
to our friends the booksellers with fear and 
trembling. Another historical novel by a 
new writer ! ! 

We cannot remember that a single dealer 
said an encouraging word. None of them 
seemed to care to know whether it was well 
written or not. It might have been as good as 
Scott's Ivanhoe. They condemned it unread. 

Yet: 
Feb. 1. — The book was published. 
Feb. 6. — More orders were received than 
we could fill. 

Feb. 5. — A new edition was put to press. 

Feb. 6. — Edition increased. 

Feb. 14. — Third edition sent to press. 

Moral : A really good book will succeed 
in spite of preconceived notions.

By THOMAS DIXON, Jr. 

A THOUSAND COPIES of this 
novel were wired for two months 
before publication by a Southern retail 
dealer ; one jobber ordered another 
1000; and advance orders of 100 and 
250 copies were common from firms 
which usually order from 10 to 25 
copies. Although it is Mr. Dixon's 
first book, the first edition was 15,000 
copies. 

The novel is a vivid and dramatic 
story of the modern South and the 
Negro question from the Southern 
white man's point of view. It is 
already creating a real sensation.

Financial Crises 

And Periods of Industrial and Commercial Depression. With Diagrams, Bibliography, and 
Index. By Theodore E. Burton. l2mo, cloth, 81.40 net; postage, 12 cts. additional. 

This valuable work combines theory, criticism, and statistical fact. In the theoretical part the author exposes 
some fallacies as to financial crises and panics and offers a positive theory which is reasonable and tenable. His 
analysis of partial gluts and of misdirected production as a chief element in producing crises and depressions is 
an important feature. Attention is called to the greater prominence in recent years of periods of depression and 
also periods of prosperity, and the decreased prominence of sharp and severe crises or panics. The author's con- 
nection with large business interests, his long experience as a lawyer, and his service in Congress, where he has 
been conspicuously identified with important committees, have afforded a wide and valuable equipment. For 
bankers and others in financial and business life, and for general readers of financial books and advanced students, 
Mr. Burton's work will have especial value. 

Love in its Tenderness 

By J. R. AiTKEN. No. 309, Appletons' Town and Country Library, 12mo, cloth, $1.00 ; 

paper, 50 cts. 

The impression made by this book, which marks the author's first appearance, is shown by the comparisons 
with Barrie and Ian Maclaren made by English reviewers who have seen the advance sheets. A vivid imagina- 
tion and a command of humor and of pathos are shown in these idyllic pictures of Scottish life, and the characters 
which appear throughout are constantly effective and delightful. 

" It reminds us of Ian Maclaren, yet Mr. Aitken has traits peculiarly his own." — London Echo. 

" An unstudied pathos and charm and radiant simplicity pervade the book." — London Daily News.

THE HUGO CENTENARY. 



Nearly seventeen years ago, the death of 
Victor Hugo, at the age of eighty-three, plunged 
into mourning the whole civilized world. At 
Goethe's age, and Voltaire's, within a few 
months, he entered into rest, and of all the 
great men of European letters since Shake- 
speare, those two alone seemed worthy to be 
named with his. For more than half a century, 
his rank had been preeminent, not among 
French writers alone, but among those of the 
whole world, and his venerable declining years 
had been crowned with such glory as is won by 
few indeed among the sons of men. His genius 
had so dominated the century which it illus- 
trated that it seemed as if history must hence- 
forth remember the period by his name, and 
speak of the Age of Hugo as it speaks of the 
Age of Dante or the Age of Shakespeare. 

Now that the years of Victor Hugo's life, 
added to the years that have elapsed since his 
death, have made up the full sum of one hun- 
dred, and men touched with his spirit and in- 
spired by his message are engaged — not alone 
in the country that has the first claim upon his 
memory — in recalling his splendid services to 
humanity and his priceless contributions to the 
treasury of that literature which has the breath 
of life everlasting, — now that the centennial 
year of his birth has been reached, it becomes 
pertinent to ask how time has dealt with his 
reputation, and how strong is still the hold of 
his works upon the artistic sense and the con- 
science of the generation that has come after 
him. The final appraisal is not yet possible, 
nor will it be for perhaps a hundred years to 
come, but some things may now be said that 
our posterity will not be likely to repudiate. 
For it must be remembered that Hugo's work 
has been tested by the apparatus of the critic 
during a much longer period than the term of 
years that he has been in his grave. It is now 
three-quarters of a century since the famous 
pronunciamento of " Cromwell " was delivered, 
and it is nearly as long since the pitched battle 
between the romanticists and classicists that 
was occasioned by the premiere of " Hernani." 
During all that time, the genius of Hugo has 



142 



THE DIAL. 



[March 1» 



been hotly championed by some, and bitterly 
assailed by others. When he died, detraction 
had already done its worst upon him, and his 
fame had emerged well-nigh untarnished from 
the smoke of the critical conflict. Since 1885, 
his assailants have found nothing to say of him 
so severe as what was said long before that 
date, and the recognition of his finer qualities — 
always admitted by those who dealt with him 
the most roughly — has been less grudgingly 
admitted even by those who have felt bound 
to enter their caveat against his acceptance as 
one of the great figures in the history of liter- 
ature. 

We have observed with close attention the 
currents and counter-currents of recent opinion 
concerning Hugo's work, and it seems to us 
that there has gradually shaped itself, in the 
consciousness of his own compatriots as well 
as in the consciousness of the cosmopolitan 
tribunal of letters, an image of the poet that 
looms larger and larger as the age recedes from 
him, an image so colossal that it dwarfs all 
others of his world-contemporaries in the re- 
trospective vision. Can we as Englishmen, 
great as must be our reverence for the mem- 
ories of Shelley and Wordsworth and Ten- 
nyson, of Carlyle and Ruskin and Emerson, 
can we in fairness claim that any of these 
men matches Hugo in artistic and moral sta- 
ture ? Can a German make the claim for Heine, 
can an Italian make it for Signor Carducci, 
can a Kussian make it for Tourguenieff, can a 
Norwegian make it for Dr. Ibsen ? Can a 
Frenchman fairly make it for Musset or Balzac 
or Renan ? To ask these questions, it seems 
to us, is to make it clear that negative answers 
are the only possible ones. Certain aspects of 
the genius of these other men may appeal to 
us more deeply, or strike more responsive chords 
in our consciousness, but the noblest personality 
of them all, with the sum total of its achieve- 
ment, set beside the personality and the achieve- 
ment of Hugo, must suffer in the comparison. 
" The spiritual sovereign of the nineteenth cen- 
tury," Mr. Swinburne calls him, and, whatever 
critical reservations we may make upon this 
point or upon that, it seems that the ascription 
is still the just due of the great poet, novelist, 
and dramatist whose writings have now been 
steadily pouring from the press for a period of 
nearly eighty years. 

Against this secular canonization of the poet 
the devil's advocate has advanced three main 
charges. The first is that, while parading 
omniscience, he is guilty of gross inaccuracies 



of scholarship and grotesque perversions of 
the truth. This charge may fairly be allowed. 
"L'Homme Qui Rit," for example, is a ro- 
mance pour rire^ as far as its background of 
historical fact is concerned. " Notre Dame de 
Paris," with its " deux tours de granit faites 
par Charlemagne," is not in much better case, 
although its subject is the history of the poet's 
own country. In short, the history of Hugo's 
blunders is as lengthy as it is amusing. The 
second charge is that he is a rhetorician, who 
cultivated a turgid, bombastic, and sensational 
manner of composition, instead of following in 
the footsteps of the great masters of style. 
This charge has a qualified truth, although it 
reduces for the most part to the complaint 
which the classicist always makes of the ro- 
manticist, and begs the deeper question which 
is really at issue. And if " Hernani," for 
example, is rhetoric rather than poetry, as 
perhaps it is, what splendid rhetoric it offers 
its readers ! When before in the French 
drama were " points " ever made with such 
telling effect as in this melodramatic inven- 
tion ! " Vous n'allez pas au fond," " Cou- 
vrons nous, grands d'Espagne," "Dieu! je 
suis exaucee," " J'en passe, et des meilleurs," 
— how the examples crowd upon the memory ! 
It may be rhetoric, but the emotions which it 
arouses are not readily to be distinguished 
from those which we experience from the 
purest tragic poetry. 

Concerning the third charge, which makes 
the poet out as a person of unbounded egotism 
and colossal self-esteem, it may be admitted 
that Hugo frequently spoke of himself in terms 
that his truest friends might wish had been 
left to others to formulate. Yet modesty and 
self-effacement are virtues that may be carried 
too far, and in Hugo's case their assumption 
would have been a hypocritical affectation. 
The prophet must be self-conscious, else he is 
no prophet ; he must have an exalted sense of 
his mission, and a fervent belief in the truth 
of his message. And if any nineteenth cen- 
tury utterance may be called prophetic, it was 
surely that of the man who proclaimed that 
" Le pofete, en des jours impies, 
Vient preparer des jours meilleurs," 

and whose faith in the sacredness of his calling 
did not waver to the end. Posterity never 
condemns a man for taking the true measure 
of himself, even if that measure be a large 
one ; it is only to his contemporaries, and dur- 
ing the period when his true dimensions are 
the subject of controversy, that such self- 



\

appraisal seems an act of questionable taste. 
When we read of Shakespeare declaring that 
his rhyme shall outlive " the gilded monu- 
ments of princes," or of Dante saying, with 
magnificent arrogance, — the question being of 
an important embassy, — " S'io vo, chi sta ; s'io 
sto, chi va?" we applaud rather than con- 
demn, we admire rather than deride, the abso- 
lute conviction of the phrase. Posterity has 
accepted these men at their own estimates ; it 
is more than possible that posterity may accept 
Hugo at his own estimate. 

There are spots upon the sun — this is about 
the substance of what unsympathetic criticism 
discovers in its examination of the work of 
Victor Hugo. But those who all their lives 
have bathed in the sunlight, and felt its vivi- 
fying warmth, are content to be simply grateful, 
and will not, for knowledge of the sun-spots, 
declare the moon to be a more satisfactory orb. 
The positive achievement of Hugo is so im- 
mense that a volume would be needed for the 
barest summary. Leaving aside his miscella- 
neous prose, descriptive, fanciful, speculative, 
critical, and political, there remain the three 
great categories of strictly creative work, poetry, 
romance, and drama. This seems to be the 
order in which they will eventually stand, the 
order in which serious criticism has already 
placed them. To the creator of " Hernani," 
*' Ruy Bias," and " Marion Delorme," we 
must give the credit of accomplishing the 
romantic revolution in French dramatic art. 
To the creator of "Notre Dame de Paris," 
" Les Miserables," and " Quatre-vingt-treize," 
we must give the credit of promulgating a new 
conception of the teachings of history and a 
new gospel of social solidarity. To the creator 
of " Les Contemplations," " Les Chatiments," 
and " La Legende des Sifecles " we must give 
the credit of first revealing the full singing 
possibilities of the French language, of rising 
to such a height of lyric expression as had been 
attained by no French poet before, of crown- 
ing the splendid edifice of French literature 
with its supreme revelation of pinnacled beauty. 
In this lyrical domain Hugo out-sang all the 
other poets of his age, and most of the poets 
of all ages ; he rose as upon the pinions of the 
eagle, and matched the richness of Pindar ; he 
soared as with the skylark's wings, and matched 
the pure note of Shelley. When at the height 
of his inspiration, he poured forth strains of 
everlasting melody, which were yet linked in 
thought with the noblest aspirations of the 
human spirit ; for his genius, while ever striving 



after the beautiful, never forgot its allegiance 
to the true and the good — to the other aspects 
of what must ever remain the triune ideal of 
the soul of man. 

One thing more must be said to round out 
this commemorative tribute to the poet whose 
centenary is now at hand. Of another great 
poet it has been written : 

" It is indeed 
Forever well our singers should 
Utter good words and know them good 
Not through song only; with close heed 
Lest, having spent for the work's sake 
Six days, the man be left to make." 

It is " not through song only " that we love 
and cherish the memory of Victor Hugo. To 
the man also our tribute is due — the man who 
spoke brave words for freedom when such 
words were most needed, the man who, at the 
sacrifice of all that was dear to him, translated 
into action the faith that was his, and made his 
protest against tyranny doubly eloquent by his 
example. One of the most grudging of his 
English critics is inspired to enthusiasm by the 
contemplation of the chief act in Hugo's life, 
and writes of it in terms of such admiration 
that we can suggest nothing to add. " The 
great fact remains. M. Hugo, in scorn of am- 
nesties and invitations, lived out nineteen years 
of exile ; his voice did not fail nor his heart 
falter ; he stood on his rock in the free British 
seas, like Elijah on Carmel, spokesman and 
champion of all those who had not bowed the 
knee to Baal." The example is one for all 
time and for all men. Only one man in a cen- 
tury may embody his protest against wrong in 
a volume of " Chatiments," but every man may 
have the strength of purpose to stand for what 
he believes to be the right, whatever the forces 
that are leagued against him. In these lax 
days of service to the spirit of compromise, 
there is no lesson more needed than that of 
Victor Hugo's " Ultima Verba " — those words 
which seemed futile enough at the time of their 
deliverance, but which, in the light of sub- 
sequent history, are seen to have been the very 
sign and seal of the poet's prophetic function. 



THE JOHNS HOPKINS ANNIVERSARY. 



It has become somewhat difficult to picture to 
ourselves the conditions which surrounded the work 
of higher education in the United States in 1876. 
Wonderful as the industrial advance of the country 
during the last twenty-five years has been, it is not 
at all more striking than the educational progress 



144 



THE DIAL. 



[March 1, 



which has carried us far from those provincial con- 
ditions. It is easy to quote figures : — four hun- 
dred graduate students (in arts) in 1875, six 
thousand in 1902, — or those sums of money in- 
vested which the newspapers use as the ready and 
exact measure of academic greatness. But there 
has been a change of spirit, or at any rate of atti- 
tude and emphasis, which statistics cannot adequately 
express. In 1876 the phrase " higher education " 
usually meant college education ; now, when it is used 
by a careful speaker or writer, it is likely that he 
means an education which begins where the college 
leaves off. In that year, while it had lately ceased 
to be true that most Americans desiring training of 
that kind sought it in Germany, it was still true 
that those who desired and could afford to have it 
under favorable conditions went there to obtain it. 
Now, the ratio of those who are pursuing it in 
America to those who are pursuing it in Germany 
is as fifteen to one. Many teachers devote them- 
selves to this sort of training exclusively. Men 
who have not received it, in some measure, cannot 
hope for employment in colleges, can hardly hope 
for places in the best schools. The great public 
draws somewhat definitely the line of distinction 
between university and college, and shows already 
a high appreciation of the methods and achieve- 
ments of the former. The professional schools in- 
tended for the education of doctors and lawyers 
and ministers have been elevated and broadened by 
the same impulse, and by the example of the grad- 
uate schools of letters and arts. 

It is because of the singularly important part 
which the Johns Hopkins University has played in 
this remarkable movement that the celebration of 
its twenty-fifth anniversary has been regarded in 
the academic world as an event of national signifi- 
cance. About a generation ago a rich Baltimore 
merchant resolved to devote his fortune, in sub- 
stantially equal parts, to the foundation of a uni- 
versity and of a hospital. Neither he nor the 
trustees to whom in his life-time he entrusted the 
former project had much knowledge or experience 
of universities and their management; but they 
had the sagacity to choose and to follow wise ad- 
visers, and the courage to approve and sustain a 
novel experiment. At the tenth anniversary the 
president of the board of trustees told the remark- 
able story of the choice of a president for the con- 
templated institution. They wrote to the presidents 
of six of the leading universities of the country, 
asking them who was the best man for the post. 
All six gave the name of the same man — Daniel 
Coit Gilman, then president of the University of 
California. No one doubts that they were right. 
Most persons would agree that nobody but Mr. 
Gilman could have created in Baltimore the Johns 
Hopkins University that we know. It is his mon- 
ument ; and it was only natural that he should be 
the central figure of the celebration of February 
21 and 22, though he resigned the presidency last 



autum.i ij^to the hands of Dr. Ira Remsen, whose 
formal inanguration occurred on the second day of 
the recent festival. 

Mr. Gilman and his trustees resolved, not to add 
to the educational system of the country one more 
college just like the rest, but to cap it with a uni- 
versity in which graduate instruction, elsewhere 
faintly beginning, should be the main object. 
Training in original investigation, and the publica- 
tion of important researches in scientific journals 
supported by the university, were to be its constant 
task. Professors were to be chosen who were great 
investigators, and were to be given every facility to 
continue their researches while teaching. The chief 
investment was to be in men. Expenditure on build- 
ings was to be kept at a minimum. Sylvester dis- 
coursed on the Abelian and Theta functions, Gil- 
dersleeve began the training of a generation of 
Grecians, Rowland conducted his researches into 
the mechanical equivalent of heat, in modest old- 
fashioned Baltimorean dwelling-houses. The new 
university was to raise its influence to the second 
power, so to speak, for it was to teach the teachers 
of America. 

It all seems obvious enough in 1902, Columbus 
having long ago balanced the egg; but to us of 
1876 it was a revelation. Entrance into the at- 
mosphere of the Johns Hopkins was, to those who 
went there in its earliest days, like the opening of 
the Pacific before the eyes of Balboa and his men. 
Here were no dated classes, no campus, no sports, 
no dormitories, no gulf between teacher and student 
where all were students, no compulsion toward 
work where all were eager. Moreover, the intel- 
lectual freedom was such as befitted a university 
having the admirable motto, " Veritas vos liberabit." 
As time has gone on, other universities, with en- 
larging resources, have developed their graduate 
schools, while the Johns Hopkins has had a period 
of pecuniary difficulties (now apparently ended by 
the generosity of its Baltimore friends) ; and has 
felt obliged, besides supporting a medical school of 
the highest class, to put much of its strength into 
its undergraduate department. Nevertheless, the 
concourse of representatives of other universities at 
the recent celebration, and the tone of the addresses 
which some of them made, showed that the Johns 
Hopkins, past and present, still holds a high and 
indeed unique position in relation to the most ad- 
vanced work. Hundreds of enthusiastic alumni, 
all of them young of course, yet many of them 
already distinguished in science, testified to the 
fruits of the Johns Hopkins experiment ; it is a 
rare college, in whatever part of the land, that 
has not at least one Hopkins man in its faculty. 
And the citizens of Baltimore showed, by their 
presence, their enthusiasm, and their hospitality, 
how cordially they appreciated the school and the 
occasion. 

On the evening of February 20 there were re- 
unions of the men who had worked in particular

laboratories or departments. The pupils of Pro- 
fessor Gildersleeve commemorated his quarter- 
century of service by a dinner and the presentation 
of a memorial volume made up of contributions to 
classical philology written by divers of their num- 
ber. On the next afternoon, at Music Hall, in the 
midst of a memorable storm, the formal exercises 
began. The President, the President Emeritus, 
Cardinal Gibbons, and a long train of trustees, 
university presidents, delegates, guests, professors, 
and alumni marched in, in imposing procession. 
Mr. Gilman, in a most skilful and comprehensive 
address, reviewed the history of the last twenty-five 
years, and set forth once more those Hopkinsian 
ideals which he has so often before expounded on 
Commemoration Day, and which he has done so 
much to make the common property of educated 
America. Then Professor Woodrow Wilson of 
Princeton, the most eloquent of the alumni, in their 
behalf presented to Mr. Gilman a beautifully illumi- 
nated address commemorating with gratitude and 
affection his labors for the university and his ser- 
vices to education, — services, it was justly said, 
*' not surpassed by those of any other American." 
The address was bound as a volume with the auto- 
graph signatures of 1012 alumni ; its presentation 
was accompanied by a demonstration from the 
audience which, coming from such a body of men, 
could not but be very grateful to Mr. Gilman, many 
as are the honors and commendations which he has 
received. After this, there were short addresses 
of felicitation by Principal Peterson of McGill 
University, Montreal, President Hadley of Yale, 
President Dabney of the University of Tennessee, 
and President Harper of the University of Chicago. 
In the evening, there was a brilliant reception in 
the principal hall of the university. 

Saturday was President Remsen's day. The 
morning's exercises began with an address of wel- 
come by the governor of the State of Maryland, 
who had been unable to be present on the preceding 
day. Governor Smith expressed forcibly and even 
eloquently the pride of Marylanders and Balti- 
moreans in their university, and declared with an 
emphasis which his position made significant his 
conviction that the state should, as of late it has 
been asked to do, assist pecuniarily in the mainten- 
ance and development of the institution. This 
duty, by the way, was eloquently enforced upon the 
minds of the alumni, at the dinner in the evening, 
by the doyen of presidents of state-aided universities, 
President Angell of Michigan. President Remsen, 
in his inaugural address, studiously avoided pre- 
dictions and declarations of policy. But his de- 
scription of the proper spirit and aims of the uni- 
versity's work, and his cheerful confidence in its 
future, left no doubt of his high success, — certainly 
no doubt in the minds of those who know his serene 
and genial temper, his honesty and good sense, his 
intellectual breadth, and the devotion he has shown 
to the university during his twenty-five years' ser- 



vice as professor of chemistry. After the conferring 
of honorary degrees. President Eliot of Harvard, 
who from the first foundation of the university has 
been its faithful friend, made a brief but impressive 
closing address. He frankly declared the obliga- 
tions of all other universities to the Johns Hopkins, 
saying that it had lifted all to a higher level ; and 
he warmly praised the work of its young medical 
school. 

The rest was social : a luncheon at the Johns 
Hopkins Hospital, and in the evening the alumni 
dinner, with large attendance and excellent speak- 
ing, presided over by Professor Josiah Royce of 
Harvard. Here the President Emeritus described 
in general outline the present plans of the Carne- 
gie Institution, of which he has just been made 
president, and Dr. Remsen gave a description, 
very interesting to the alumni, of the beautiful 
Homewood tract of land, at the north of the city, 
which by the munificence of a few citizens has been 
given to the university as a site for its future home. 

The inauguration of a new president marks 
always a new point of departure in the history of an 
American university, especially since it became 
customary to lodge preponderant power in the 
hands of one man. But in the present case there 
are still other, and manifest reasons for expecting 
a new era in the development of the Johns Hop- 
kins. Removal to the new site will no doubt soon 
take place, and will make a difference that it is 
hard to estimate. There will be more room, 
greater quiet, the influence of beautiful surround- 
ings, a better opportunity to foster the social and 
athletic life of the undergraduates. On the other 
hand, the heart of a great city is in some ways a 
better place for a great university than its outskirts, 
and graduate work in some departments must suffer 
at least until the library has become so far devel- 
oped that remoteness from the Peabody Institute 
has ceased to be important. It is also evident that, 
however generous the people of Baltimore are dis- 
posed to be toward the university of which they 
have become so proud, the city is not rich enough 
to enable it to maintain, in comparison with uni- 
versities planted in wealthier towns, the preemi- 
nence in graduate work which for several years it 
enjoyed. Let us hope that they will enable it to 
remain in this respect an equal, though doubtless 
with a constituency less national and more largely 
Southern, than in its first years. 

But there were phases of the Johns Hopkins 
celebration which suggested also the close of one 
era in the general life of American universities at 
large, and the opening of another. In the making 
of doctors of philosophy, as in other new American 
industries, there has naturally come first an era of 
competition, a competition not ignoble and not 
without public utility, yet marked by some regret- 
table excesses. The reaction has already set in. 
The first and most important influence exerted in 
restraint of excessive competition has been that 



146

[March 1, 



of the many national scientific societies, in each of 
which, at their annual meetings, the professors 
of many colleges join in discussing the matters of 
their common Fach and in laying plans for its ad- 
vancement. They meet as friends, and immerse 
themselves for the time in concerns which transcend 
those of any particular college or university. When 
they go home, the sense of these wider interests 
abides in their minds ; and they can be relied on to 
uphold them. All universities have members — 
presidents or others — who are veritable academic 
Chauvins, consumed with myopic zeal for their own 
universities. They are growing fewer. The set 
who attend scientific meetings are holding them in 
check. Again, the most potent source of what is 
called commercialism in American universities is 
the unchastened ambition of presidents, eager for 
the pecuniary (assumed to be identical with the 
intellectual) aggrandizement of their own institu- 
tions. Against this evil also the most effective 
counterweight has been the zeal of professors for 
larger and loftier interests, which must be harmed 
by vulgar competition, but wijl be signally for- 
warded by inter-university friendship, cooperation, 
and dependence. This broader spirit has grown 
rapidly in recent years. The university presidents 
themselves have joined in an association for the 
annual discussion of common topics. The age of 
mutual combination is displacing that of competi- 
tion. Of the " outward and visible signs " of this 
new and most welcome stage of progress one of the 
most agreeable is the cordial enjoyment and fra- 
ternal feeling with which all the universities join in 
the celebrations of any one among their number ; 
for, in the profoundly Christian phrase which 
President Eliot used with such happy effect, *' we 
are all members one of another."

MARY STUART AND THE " CASKET LETTERS." 

( To the Editor of The Dial.) 

In connection with my review of Mr. Andrew Lang's 

" The Mystery of Mary Stuart " in a recent issue of 

The Dial, the following extract from a note which I 

have received from Mr. Lang is of interest : 

" I put in the forged letters to show how easily the Queen's 
hand could be imitated. I have since found unknown MSS. 
in another case, the Gowrie affair of 1600. Here there was 
wholesale forgery, but comparing the forged letters (of Logan 
of Kestelrig) with his genuine letters (which had never been 
done) we cannot detect any difference. This of course only 
shows the practicability of successful forgery of Mary's let- 
ters. The comparison of Logan's was made at the time, but 
failed to detect forgery : I mean that it has not been done 
since 1609. The difficulty as to Mary, is to say whether she 
repeated herself in sonnets and letters, or whether the letters 
are forged from the sonnets. Bad is the best."

A Journey to Austex-LiAnd.* 



" The readers of Jane Austen," so Mr. 
Howells has lately told us, " are hardly ever 
less than her adorers : she is a passion and a 
creed, if not quite a religion." IjE Mr. Howells 
himself is to be taken as fairly exemplifying 
the attitude of the cult, we need not question 
his terms ; with him Jane Austen is assuredly 
a passion. If, on the other hand, we feel that 
his praise is a little warm to be representative, 
we shall still be in no doubt of the existence 
of admirers whose enthusiasm will insure a 
cordial welcome for Miss Constance Hill's 
delightfully sympathetic volume entitled "Jane 
Austen : Her Homes and her Friends." 

Of course there may be " adorers " of Miss 
Austen who are content to study her as she 
laughingly whispers, " What a dear, simple 
old gentleman ! " from her shadowy corner 
behind Mr. Woodhouse's chair ; or as she 
peeps demurely and very unobtrusively over 
Elizabeth Bennet's shoulder, still smiling 
kindly at the Vanity Fair — not, in spite of 
Solomon, all vanity — which she analyzes so 
keenly and paints so deftly. Other admirers 
will not care to go beyond Miss Austen's let- 
ters, as delightful in their way as her novels, 
and marked by the same dainty finish, the same 
freshness and vivacious wit. And if such 
readers want a background of biographical 
detail, they will choose a brief sketch like Mrs. 
Maiden's in preference to anything more am- 
bitious. But Miss Hill is quite safe in counting 
on the twentieth century zest for what may be 
called the geography of genius ; on the modern 
temper, which, distrustful that the style — at 
least in the novel — is the man, wants to hear 
its literary lion roar ; or, if that is impossible, 
to know how, and furthermore where and in 
what company, he learned to roar in print to 
such purpose. 

Just such a study of environment Miss Hill 
offers us. Her book is primarily a record of 
her pilgrimage to " Austen-land," — or shall 
we say to the Austen-lands, since Miss Austen 
lived successively in the little Hampshire vil- 
lage of Steventon, at Bath, at Southampton, 
and finally in Hampshire again on her brother 
Edward's estate at Chawton. In each of these 
places, and several more where Miss Austen

made lengthy visits, her home or lodging has 
been searched out that it may be carefully 
described, and also pictured for us by Miss 
Ellen Hill, whose quaint little sketches add 
much to the interest of the text. Miss Austen 
was not essentially an out-door woman — in 
her day fragile and feminine were likely to be 
synonyms, — nor does description of natural 
scenery play any considerable part in her novels. 
So Miss Hill's task is limited to telling us of 
each home and its garden, always a favorite 
resort with the ladies of the Austen family, 
of the houses at which Jane visited oftenest, 
and of the Assembly rooms where she indulged 
her fondness for dancing. 

Among her friends her large family stood 
first and indeed almost alone, if we are to 
judge by Miss Hill's account. Dearest of all 
was her only sister Cassandra, from whom in 
her childhood she was so inseparable that her 
mother once declared, " If Cassandra were 
going to have her head cut off, Jane would in- 
sist on sharing her fate." She was very fond of 
all five of her brothers ; but Henry, who helped 
her with the publication of her novels, and 
Edward, who after his father's death gave his 
mother and sisters a home, were perhaps her 
favorites. Her father and mother, while closely 
associated with her, seem to have inspired awe 
rather than such affection as she lavished on 
Cassandra and later on some of her young 
nephews and nieces. With them ends the tale 
of friends to whom Miss Hill has accorded 
more than mere mention. 

Her unique contribution to Austen literature, 
then, consists in her conscientious picture of 
Miss Austen's environment. Further than this, 
and as corollary to it, she aims to portray 
Miss Austen's character, as her friends saw 
it and as her home life revealed it, and to 
trace the connection between the author's ex- 
periences and the scenes and incidents of her 
novels. 

In this latter attempt Miss Hill is particu- 
larly successful in the first third of her book, 
which is devoted to Jane Austen's life at the 
Steventon parsonage. Here, except for a "short 
school course " and an occasional visit, she spent 
the first twenty-five years of her life. Very 
uneventful years they were in the main, passed 
in the pleasant companionship of her own 
family circle and of three or four congenial 
neighbors. She read and embroidered and 
kept house, paid calls, revelled in the balls at 
the Basingstoke Assembly rooms, and was oc- 
casionally thrown into a delightful flutter of 



excitement by a letter or perhaps a flying visit 
from one of her sailor brothers. She lived, in 
short, the wholesome village life that she por- 
trays, and she lived it quite in the spirit of her 
heroines. For though the first drafts of " Pride 
and Prejudice," " Sense and Sensibility," and 
" Northanger Abbey " were written at Steven- 
ton, " amid the cheerful chatter " of the family 
sitting-room, there was not then — indeed there 
never was — anything of the professed authoress 
in Miss Austen's view of life ; and here na 
doubt lies one secret of her genius. 

Miss Hill does not stop at such general re- 
semblance between Jane Austen's environment 
and the setting of her novels. The " wood 
walk " at the parsonage reminds her of the 
pleasure grounds of Cleveland in " Sense and 
Sensibility." Frank Austen's letter telling of 
his promotion to the rank of commander sug- 
gests those announcing a like good fortune for 
William Price. At Bath Miss Austen's visits 
to the " Lower Rooms " are reminiscent of 
Catherine Morland's first meeting with Henry 
Tilney. And her stay at Lyme makes an 
opportunity for conducting us, as Tennyson 
insisted upon being conducted, to the scene of 
Louisa Musgrove's accident. " Don't talk to 
me of the Duke of Monmouth," cried the poet 
to his friends who were doing the honors of the 
historic village, " show me the exact spot where 
Louisa Musgrove fell ! " 

While these parallels between Miss Austen's 
personal experiences and the life portrayed in 
her novels are kept up all through the biog- 
raphy, the general reader's curiosity about the 
genuineness of Miss Austen's realism is satisfied 
by the time the Steventon period of her life 
has been recounted. He has then made sure 
that for once at least the style is emphatically 
the woman. He sees that it was because she 
dealt with the life she knew intimately that 
she was able to master her material so perfectly; 
because she loved her dull little world, finding 
it neither too small nor too dull to be intensely 
interesting, that she was able to show its un- 
derlying charm and its real significance, — in 
short to mould it into the form we call art. 

Very properly, then, through the rest of her 
book Miss Hill is chiefly occupied with de- 
picting Jane Austen's personality, as her little 
circle of friends knew it and as her home life 
showed it. Here she is of course on ground 
trodden by all Miss Austen's biographers ; and 
like the rest she must depend for her material 
upon Mr. Austen Leigh's memoir of his dis- 
tinguished aunt, upon the various editions of

her letters, and upon family manuscripts re- 
lating to her and now in the possession of the 
Austen family. But if this feature of Miss 
Hill's work is least original, it is perhaps most 
remunerative for the reader. Miss Austen is 
after all of interest not as having lived here or 
there and done this or that, but as being Jane 
Austen, a personality powerful enough to domi- 
nate her quiet life and give its rather bare 
chronicle charm. Her life was indeed without 
incident and, in spite of the efforts of all her 
biographers, including Miss Hill, to prove the 
contrary, apparently without romance ; but 
about herself there is nothing commonplace. 
Her sprightly wit and unaffected sweetness 
endeared her to all who knew her. Her won- 
derful energy made novel-writing a mere epi- 
sode, not interfering at all with household 
duties, needlework, charities, or the visits of 
nephews and nieces. More remarkable still is 
her perfect poise — that of the real humorist. 
If she ever lost herself it was in pleasure at the 
success of her novels. For the most part she 
maintained absolutely that mean between ab- 
sorption and ennui which marks the temper of 
the great artist ; who, playing his part in life's 
drama, still can catch the critic's point of view, 
but who is always too much the player to grow 
cynical over the tinsel whose deceptive charm 
he himself has felt. 

Such is the picture Miss Hill gives us. Occa- 
sionally the personal narrative form of the book 
is too obtrusive ; but the style is always admir- 
ably clear, the verification satisfactory, and the 
material interesting. It remains only to speak 
of the illustrations, which, besides the numer- 
ous sketches of Miss Austen's homes and haunts 
already spoken of, include many photogravure 
reproductions of family portraits. Another 
feature of the book is the dainty cover design, 
which is a facsimile of the embroidery upon a 
muslin scarf worked in satin-stitch by Jane 
Austen. Edith Kellogg Dunton. 



The World and the Individual.* 

The Scottish universities may now be said 
to have the most excellent kind of provision, 
in the shape of ample pecuniary endowment, 
for original speculation upon the eternally old 
and the eternally new subject of the philosophy

of religion. Owing to a bequest from the 
late Lord Gifford, one of the judges of the 
Scottish Court of Session, each of the four an- 
cient seats of learning in Scotland (the Uni- 
versities of Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, and 
St. Andrews) has now a sum of money which 
yields from $3000 to $4000 a year for lectures 
by men of note upon the problems of Natural 
Theology — the ultimate meaning of the uni- 
verse so far as its bearing upon man and his 
destiny is concerned. A lecturer is invariably 
appointed for two years, and the universities 
in their wisdom have seen it fit to exact of him 
only ten lectures a year ; so that the fortunate 
appointees, in addition to the honor of the 
election and the subsequent profit from publi- 
cation in book form of their lectures, enjoy the 
remunerative features of giving some twenty 
lectures at from $300 to $400 a lecture. The 
appointment of a lecturer lies entirely in the 
hands, not of the head of the university (as 
might perhaps be the custom with us), but of 
the professors, in particular in the hands of the 
professors of philosophy and theology — in 
consultation, to be sure, with their colleagues. 
By the terms of the will no conditions what- 
ever of religious belief or disbelief are to be 
considered of importance in determining the 
election of a lecturer. The appointee may be- 
long or not belong to a religious body or de- 
nomination. And also, by the express conditions 
of the bequest, the lecturer is not allowed in 
his argument to place explicit reliance upon 
any so-called positive revelation. He may, in- 
deed, be known in his private capacity to rely 
upon Revelation for a solution of the question 
of the mystery of the world ; but in the Gifford 
Lectures before the universities and their public 
he is to dwell especially upon a philosophy or 
theory of the teachings of nature and of human 
reason. 

As in the case of a great many recent be- 
quests to universities, the universities them- 
selves had at first grave doubts and difficulties 
as to the way in which the Gifford money could 
best be spent. To most men of mature years 
who have passed the greater part of their lives 
in scientific and philosophical investigation 
there seems to be something rather fatuous, 
something almost serio-comic, in the spectacle 
of four men getting up every winter before the 
public in four different Scottish towns to attack 
the old question of the proofs for the Being of 
God. And indeed it must be confessed that 
it is a somewhat serious expenditure of time 
and nervous energy to listen year after year

(as must a sufficient number of professors to 
make up a platform for politeness' sake) to the 
same eternal debate on a question that you 
may, in your own way, believe to be evident or 
to be insoluble by mere science. For after all 
the man who does his duty, or the " least " in 
the kingdom of heaven, may have visions de- 
nied to a great logician or specialist. 

Be all this as it may, the Scottish universities 
found in the law courts that they must spend 
the money very much in the way indicated in 
the will of Lord Gifford, who had been known 
to be a profound student of the pantheism of 
Spinoza and to have the most decided kind of 
opinions about the importance of Natural The- 
ology. All attempts to use the Gifford money 
for the creation of special chairs or lectureships 
or fellowships for the study of the science of 
religion, or of Eastern religions, or of com- 
parative religion, or what not, had to be aban- 
doned. And so for all time we shall see every 
year in Scotland these four men standing forth 
and offering reasons for their scientific or phil- 
osophic creed ; and we shall soon have an array 
of published volumes whose magnitude will 
altogether surpass that of the celebrated Bridge- 
water Treatises or of the Oxford Bamptou 
Lectures. The very giving of these lectures 
and the issuing of these volumes may to the 
minds of many, who have perhaps a groundless 
prejudice against state universities, seem to be 
a somewhat disturbing influence upon the 
minds of young people in Scotland, in making 
them think of certain matters as unsettled rather 
than settled. But on the other hand, all lovers 
of truth and progress and light cannot but 
welcome this provision for unprejudiced in- 
quiry into and discussion of the greatest ques- 
tions that can occupy the mind of man. And 
all true Scotchmen can again pride themselves 
upon the fact that, while their country may 
justly be known as a land where a sound atti- 
tude upon the deeper realities of life is an in- 
gredient in the national temper, it will also 
continue to be known as a thinking country — 
as a country where men look before they leap. 
And it would indeed be an evil day for Scot- 
land or for any other country when the univer- 
sities, the special creation of the Protestant 
spirit, should stand before the public for any- 
thing else than truth and light above all things. 

It was natural enough that the Gifford lec- 
turers should be drawn, in the first few years 
after 1888, from within Great Britain, and 
that such well-known thinkers as Hutchison 
Stirling, the two Cairds, Andrew Lang, Max 



Miiller, Campbell Fraser (one of Barrie's 
" Edinburgh Eleven "), Lewis Campbell, and 
others, should start the series. Men of science, 
too, like Sir George Stokes of Cambridge, 
were also selected. But soon the Scottish pro- 
fessors, who could, of course, hardly hand 
round the lectureships among themselves, had 
to look abroad for help, and called upon schol- 
ars like Pfleiderer of Berlin, Tiele of Holland, 
and James and Royce of Harvard University. 
Professor James has as yet delivered but one 
series of lectures. 

Unlike most of the works that have appeared 
in England or America since the early days 
of the " Hegelian invasion " into our philo- 
sophical world (it was forshadowed of course 
by the Transcendentalism of Carlyle and Em- 
erson), i. e., since the first writings of Hutchison 
Stirling of Edinburgh (the famous " Secret of 
Hegel ") and the Cairds of Glasgow and Green 
of Oxford and Dr. W. T. Harris (once as 
famous as the editor of the " Journal of Specu- 
lative Philosophy " as he now is as the United 
States Commissioner of Education), the pub- 
lished lectures of Professor Royce lay their 
main emphasis not upon an impersonal " Uni- 
versal " or " Absolute " in which God and man 
and the world seem to be fused into one another, 
but rather upon the Individual and his free 
moral effort and upon a Personal Deity who has 
both Reason and Will. Hegelianism or Neo- 
Hegelianism (for the English interpretation of 
Hegel does not represent all the sides of his 
teaching) has been, as nearly all college gradu- 
ates of the past two decades know, the inspir- 
ation of the Idealism that has nobly served as 
a counter philosophy to the growing Naturalism 
and the Materialistic Evolution of the last third 
of the nineteenth century. Professor Royce 
himself only too gladly confesses in his lectures 
the extent of his debt to the writings of Kant 
and Hegel and their followers, and indeed it 
may be said that without their work his work 
and nearly all the important work in recent 
philosophy would have been impossible. But 
all the deeper students of Neo-Hegelianism 
know from their own experience how well- 
grounded have been the complaints of the 
upholders alike of " Orthodoxy " and of " Com- 
mon Sense," regarding the extent to which the 
realities of man's separate personality, the re- 
alities of individual effort, of right and wrong, 
of the personal will of God, seem to suffer in 
Hegel's " Panlogism," as it has been called (if 
this be Hegel) — in that " dialectic " or moving- 
shadow world in which an eternal thinker seems 



150 



THE DIAL 



[March 1, 



to be eternally thinking his own mere thoughts, 
or to be setting up logical difficulties merely 
for the pleasure of overcoming them. So far 
does "Hegelianism" sometimes seem to travel 
from the world of ordinary reality that some of 
the most important events of the philosophical 
world of the last twenty-five years have been 
the conversions or the confessions or the recan- 
tations of distinguished thinkers who were once 
deeply imbued with the very spirit and letter 
of what they believed to be Hegelianism. Two 
of the most conspicuous instances of these re- 
cantations have been the writings of the accom- 
plished successor of Fraser at Edinburgh in the 
chair of Hamilton, — Professor Andrew Seth 
(now A. S. Pringle-Pattison), whose return to 
the rationality of the but recently despised 
Scottish " Common Sense " philosophy was 
doubtless the occasion of the interest manifested 
in his Princeton lectures upon Theism ; and, 
further, the brilliant and epigrammatic writ- 
ings of F. H. Bradley, the popular Oxford 
thinker who is regarded by many men of letters 
as the English master of the art of dialectic, — 
as a modern Parmenides. In the great meta- 
physical treatise of Bradley on " Appearance 
and Reality " (dubbed by some witty critic the 
" Disappearance of Reality ") a kind of nega- 
tive Hegelian dialectic is turned against the re- 
ality of the " Neo-Hegelian " God, and thus the 
very pillars of that spiritual philosophy, which 
has kept a generation of men from turning to 
the " husks " of materialism, seem for the 
moment to have been torn down by an intellec- 
tual Samson. And in the wake of these two 
older men several of the younger thinkers have 
not been slow to follow, in books and articles 
that draw inspiration not merely from Hegel 
but from "fresh fields and pastures new" that- 
have been partly ignored by the Hegelians. At 
Oxford (as we read in a London review) a 
number of young men have banded them- 
selves together to produce a volume of essays 
that shall do more justice to personality and 
aspiration and the moral life than has been 
accorded to these things by some of Hegel's 
followers. 

It is the distinctive merit of Professor Royce's 
published lectures to have given, as the result 
of a logic as rigorous as that of Bradley or 
Green or Caird, an idealistic philosophy of the 
world, in which a separate reality and a genuine 
moral experience and a personal immortality 
are given to all finite beings who are capable 
of " working out " with the help of God (he be- 
lieves in this too, as does the Hebrew Psalmist 



or the Apostle Paul) their salvation. It may 
be claimed that just as the great book of Mr. 
Bradley has closed hy a negative criticism the 
first Neo-Hegelian period in English thought, 
so the lectures of Professor Royce are the first 
great positive attempt in English to rise beyond 
the closed circle that was for some time wrongly 
taken to be the essence of Hegel. The lec- 
tures have already been discussed in this light 
at the annual meeting of the American Psy- 
chological Association at Chicago University 
last Christmas, and they are certain to affect 
the constructive period of philosophy upon 
which we are entering with the century. " It is 
precisely," says Professor Royce, " the restor- 
ation of individuality to the self that constitutes 
the essential deed of our Idealism." Of course 
out of all this preliminary polemical work will 
there come in due time a fuller and juster ap- 
preciation of Hegel and Hegelianism, for it is 
eternally true that Hegel's philosophy is to a 
great extent but another name for systematic 
thinking and that "outside " Hegel there is no 
philosophy. 

But Professor Royce's work is interesting 
for another reason. Next to the interests of 
theology and a common sense justice to the 
divine rights of the personality of man, there 
is perhaps no question that so interests the 
popular mind of today as the social question. 
Theology itself, in fact, is becoming (not al- 
together rightly to be sure) largely a social 
gospel, and the reality of the life of the indi- 
vidual is held by some to lie in his power of 
" losing " it to find it again in the life of others. 
And from the standpoint of philosophy it 
must be confessed that the " social spirit," the 
social conception of the " self " and the socio- 
logical conception of the world, have practically 
revivified the metaphysic of to-day. No one 
need be surprised at this. The student of 
philosophy can tell the average man that both 
in Germany and in England some of the most 
cogent tests of the reality or the unreality of 
any philosophy have always been found in the 
writings of men who have shown its bearings 
upon our common life as human beings. The 
socialistic writings of Marx and Lasalle kept 
alive the spirit of Hegelianism long after its 
letter had ceased to have a hold upon the Ger- 
man mind ; and in England itself the social 
writings of men like Edward Caird (whose 
little book on Comte is one of the best things 
he has done) and Mackenzie and Bosanquet 
have revealed the social mission of Idealism at 
a time when the technicalities of Hegel's Logic

THE DIAL

are ignorantly supposed to have been set aside 
as a kind of jargon of the schools. 

The social spirit and the social idea have had 
the very greatest kind of influence upon Pro- 
fessor Royce. Without at all entering into 
precise detail, it may be said that one of his 
most fundamental positions is to the effect that 
it is only in our dear daily life of common 
effort, in the life of family and state and 
" church," that man enters into his true king- 
dom — enters upon the realities of what he 
(Royce) calls the World of Appreciation (i. e., 
the world of " ideals " and " values "), as dif- 
ferent from the appearances of the World of 
Description (i. e., the world of " sense " and 
" science"). The " appearances of the World 
of Description " ! Yes ! that is one of the main 
lessons of the book, — the sad error of materi- 
alism and materialistic living ! That the world 
of physical science, the world of " atoms " and 
" cells " and " motion " and " laws," is in a 
very vital sense an " appearance " world — I 
will not say an unreal world, but an apparent 
world, a world that is simply a version or 
description of the world in the interests of our 
moral and intellectual life ! It is only from 
the standpoint of the social and ethical life 
that we can logically (the pith of the argument 
is to show this) regard our life of sense and all 
the physical world as essentially a meaning — 
a meaning that is completed in the certainties 
of the religious life. Paley used to talk about 
design and purpose. Professor Royce talks 
about meaning ; that is, Paley saw things from 
the outside, whereas Professor Royce sees them 
from the inside. No wonder that Darwin and 
Huxley refuted Paley ! The chief effort of the 
lectures upon " The World and the Individual " 
is to show that the reality of everything, or of 
anything, is to be found ultimately in its 
meaning ; and the true meaning of the life 
of the world and of sentient beings is to be 
found in one vast Society, one great realm of 
beings, whose lives find their meanings com- 
pleted in a Kingdom of God, — a kingdom in 
which human beings live again to realize 
<* All we have willed or hoped or dreamed of good . . ." 

The ordinarily educated person who has an 
interest in the higher thought of this age, or 
the thinker who is troubled about the "evolu- 
tion hypothesis," will find a great deal in Pro- 
fessor Royce's two volumes. And their thor- 
oughly practical character may be said to set 
forth on a large scale the possible contribution 
of the American spirit to the solution of old 
and world-wide problems. America has every 



reason to be proud of her first lectures in the 
Gifford series. We shall look forward to the 
lectures that another American philosopher, 
Professor William James, is at the present 
time giving at Edinburgh, for his book called 
" The Will to Believe " has already created 
quite a voluminous literature.

Our Younger Poets.* 

The minor poet has fallen upon fortunate 
days. So much attention is paid at the present 
time to literary production of every sort that 
the humblest of writers gets his share of ephem- 
eral glory. It was not always thus, and form- 
erly the minor poet had to be content with 
the furtive publication of his slender volume 
(at his own expense), with a few lines of com- 
ment, kindly or severe, and with the halo that 
encircled his brow in the eyes of his family 
and immediate friends. But now he gets him- 
self into print without difficulty, receives grave 
attention at the hands of novelists, clergymen, 
and other competent critics, and enjoys some- 
thing very like fame for at least a brief period. 
So it comes to pass that such a book as Mr. 
William Archer's " Poets of the Younger Gen- 
eration," containing over five hundred pages 
of characterization and extract, can secure both 
a publisher and a public. We are determined 
to magnify our poets, and, since the greater 
voices are nearly all silenced, the lesser voices 
have their innings, and are treated as if they 
also were gifted with the divine accent and the 
prophetic utterance. 

We have no thought to speak scornfully of 
the minor poet, or to begrudge him any of the 
honest praise which Mr. Archer bestows upon 
him. We have often, in all sincerity and 
thankfulness, bestowed upon him the same sort 
of praise, and discussed him in the same spirit 
of seriousness. Yet the sight of this big and 
sumptuous book, with its array of names all of 
which have yet to be tested by time, somehow 
suggests a disproportion between means and 
ends, and the anticipation of a verdict that 
cannot in the nature of things be returned until 
most of us who are now living are in our graves. 
One should long hesitate about enshrining in 
a big book of any sort the names of men and 
women whose own books may be absolutely 
forgotten two or three decades hence ; it were

better that opinion concerning these persons 
should shape itself by natural processes rather 
than be given thus prematurely the semblance 
of a permanent form. 

Again we must disclaim any intention of 
impugning Mr. Archer's motives in producing 
the present volume, or even of disputing his 
main positions and judgments. The book, de- 
spite its bulk, is essentially modest and unpre- 
tentious, and the author takes us so frankly 
into his confidence that adverse criticism is for 
the most part disarmed in advance. The story 
of the book is, briefly, that Mr. Archer enjoys 
poetry, that he has read widely among the 
younger poets of our time, that he has selected 
thirty-three of the English and American 
writers who have most appealed to him, and 
that to each of these he has devoted a few ex- 
pository pages, abundantly eked out with illus- 
trative examples. The book is subjective in 
method. The author tells us what he likes, 
and evidently hopes that his readers will like 
it also. If they do not, and he should be asked 
to justify his judgment, he would be quite 
helpless. He admits that he has not included 
certain excellent poets for the simple reason 
" that their work does not happen to chime 
with my idiosyncrasy." Intellectually, he rec- 
ognizes their merit, but it does not touch his 
emotions. Everything that the objective critic 
regards as fundamentally important is eschewed 
by Mr. Archer. He makes no comparisons, 
invokes no canons of literary art, traces no re- 
lations between the poet and the tendencies of 
his age. He simply tells us what he likes and 
what he dislikes. 

In order that we may reckon with the per- 
sonal equation in Mr. Archer's estimates, he 
supplies us with a sort of spiritual autobiog- 
raphy, in which we learn when, and by what 
means, his taste for poetry developed, what 
are the poets who mean the most to him, and 
to what others he is relatively insensible. In 
doing this, he adopts a suggestion of Mr. John 
M. Robertson, who declares it to be the critic's 
duty to give his readers " an opportunity of 
checking his individual judgments." Says 
Mr. Archer : " The day may very well come 
when every critic will be called upon to fill up 
[a] schedule of temperament and qualification, 
in order that readers may know clearly through 
what medium they are invited to contemplate 
any given work of art." A note to this pas- 
sage embodies what we should be tempted to 
think a jest were it not for the author's con- 
fession on the next page that he is " a pure- 



bred Scotchman." The note is to this effect : 
" It might perhaps be desirable, for the guid- 
ance of the person criticised, that a statement 
of the critic's athletic record, his chest meas- 
urement, and his fighting weight should be 
included." 

Coming to the author's confession of taste, 
we learn that he is insensible to music^ save of 
the simplest, that he had the usual boyish 
attack of Byronism, and that from Words- 
worth he learned the true meaning of poetry. 
Greek and Latin poetry mean little to him, 
Chaucer and Shakespeare much. Milton he 
did not really discover until nearly thirty, but 
that poet has been to him ever since " an in- 
exhaustible mine of the pure gold of poetry." 
When it comes to Shelley, he says " Sibbo- 
leth " in defiance of those who would slay him 
" at the passages of Jordan." Of American 
poets, Poe, Emerson, and Whitman are the 
chief. German poetry he loves, although he 
cares more for Heine than for Goethe, but to 
French poetry he remains color-blind. After 
the frankness of these confessions, we are pre- 
pared for an occasional surprising saying, as, 
for example, that he would be puzzled to dis- 
tinguish from internal evidence the poets who 
wrote " Songs from Vagabondia," and that there 
is no very wide gap between Mr. Le Gallienne's 
Omar and the immortal poem of FitzGerald. 
Every man has a right to his own opinions, 
and we cannot quarrel with one who makes 
no effort to erect his subjective fancies into 
objective dicta. 

What we find, then, when we turn from the 
introduction to the volume proper, is a series 
of pleasantly written discussions of such of 
our younger poets as Mr. Archer likes suffi- 
ciently to care to take into consideration. The 
list of poets is worth giving. On the English 
side, it comprises Messrs. Beeching, Benson, 
Binyon, Quiller-Couch, Money-Coutts, David- 
son, A. E. Housman, Laurence Housman, 
Kipling, Le Gallienne, Newbolt, Phillips, 
Symons, Thompson, Trench, Watson, and 
Yeats — seventeen men, — and Mmes. Hiuk- 
son, Hopper, Meynell, Nesbit, Radford, Siger- 
son, Watson, and Woods — eight women. Of 
this list one may say that a number of equally 
important names are omitted, but that it is 
excellent as far as it goes. The selection of 
the eight American poets cannot be accounted 
for by any process of rational thought. They 
include the three Canadians, Messrs. Roberts, 
Carman, and Scott, and their friend, the late 
Richard Hovey. But the wildest guess would

never hit upon the four writers who are se- 
lected to represent the art of poetry as now 
practised by the younger writers of this coun- 
try. According to Mr. Archer, these four are 
Miss Alice Brown, Professor Santayana, Mr. 
Madison Cawein, and Father Tabb. Mr. Archer 
would have done vastly better to leave Amer- 
ican poetry out of his reckoning than to rep- 
resent it in this meagre and eccentric fashion. 
His own disclaimer concerning " the hopeless- 
ness of attempting to do more than cull a 
flower here and there " cannot be accepted as 
a sufficient warrant for this extraordinary 
showing. William Morton Payne. 



History of Architecture in Italy.* 



In all forms of art expression, there is a 
spirit which lies deeper than the surface ; though 
in Architecture it is the superficial aspect which 
appeals foremost, and perhaps finally, to the 
great majority of observers — or, better, spec- 
tators, for one is hardly an observer whose 
glance does not penetrate beneath the surface. 
In the art of an individual worker, this spirit 
has a quality almost wholly subjective, and is 
revealed only to the discerning student of human 
nature ; so that the study of the individual's 
efforts in art is, to a great extent, a study of 
personality. When the individual's effort is 
merged in the achievements of the race, the art 
is a matter for history. The personal equation, 
though not wanting, is generally lost sight of 
in the broader problem of the race-spirit. The 
history of architecture is the history of the 
deepest life-passions of the races, which some- 
times, building " better than they knew," have 
raised to their memory enduring architectural 
monuments. 

The lands stretching southward from the 
Alps and the Pyrenees to the borders of the 
great inland sea hold for us a most vital in- 
terest ; for over them ran the hordes of the 
north, that met the civilization of the east 
and of the south in sustained and bitter con- 
flict, to the end that the southern and eastern 
civilizations were swept from the continent of 
Europe and the northern barbarism was tamed 
and softened and developed into a newer and 
fuller civilization, in whose monuments are 
reminiscent the beauty and power of the older

tecture, from the Time of Constantine to the Dawn of the

and vanished civilizations. Spain is rich in the 
memories of this conflict ; but it is to Italy that 
we are drawn with the keenest sympathy, for 
from that land of sunshine vivifying beams of 
art have penetrated into the great cold heart 
of the north, and from the heart of that north 
are we of the Western World. To behold these 
monuments, and recognize their superficial 
beauty, is one thing ; to feel the life-blood of 
great races rushing through them is another, — 
and toward this latter end a sympathetic his- 
tory will materially help the student. Mr. 
Charles A. Cummings, an American architect 
of distinction, has essayed a work of this sort, 
in his recently published history of Archi- 
tecture in Italy, surveying the field from the 
time of Constantine to the dawn of the Renais- 
sance. It is a wide field, and the author esti- 
mates very modestly — possibly underestimates 
— the value of his work, which was undertaken 
because, although needed and greatly to be de- 
sired, no similar work exists in English, and 
works in other languages, though numerous 
and in some instances extremely full and com- 
plete, are found to have limitations which im- 
pair their value to the student. To write a 
history of social and political life, one must of 
necessity be an historian in the recognized sense 
of the word ; to write sympathetically a history 
of architecture, one must of necessity be both 
an architect and historian, for architecture is 
an expression of the social and political life of 
a people in the terms of art. Obviously, the 
combination of architect and historian must be 
rare, if not quite impossible, in an age of 
specialization ; but Mr. Cummings has suc- 
ceeded in combining the functions in a high 
degree, and his work is one of great value 
to the student, as well as of extreme interest 
to the " general reader," who will follow it 
with a volume of mediaeval history at hand for 
side excursions into other than architectural 
fields. 

Mr. Cummings regards Christianity as " the 
mother of Italian architecture," and finds " its 
earliest appearance in the catacombs." From 
this germ, according to his view, sprang the 
early basilicas, " from which were developed 
the great churches which are still the admira- 
tion of the world." The work, until the last 
chapter is reached, has to do mainly with 
churches ; for they are the principal monuments 
remaining to us from the middle ages, and 
were built for the most part, perhaps, in the 
spirit and to the glory of the religion of Jesus 
Christ. But many of them were built through

fear and superstition, and in fulfilment of vows ; 
for a great marauding band rarely set forth on 
a predatory expedition without first invoking 
aid at some great shrine and vowing the erec- 
tion of a greater shrine should the venture prove 
successful. Often the vows were fulfilled, and 
frequently at the expense of some beautiful 
Christian church already existing, which was 
despoiled of its riches of sculpture and orna- 
ment for the adornment of the newer edifice. 
All of this in no way diminishes the romance 
of the tale, but makes difficult the writing of 
architectural history, and is only an instance 
of the difficulties with which the historian has 
to contend. 

After tracing the development of the early 
Christian church from its germ in the cata- 
combs, Mr. Cummings says : " No essential 
feature can be cited of the early basilican church, 
or of the square, circular, or polygonal churches 
of the first four centuries after Constantine, 
which had not its prototype in the temples or 
the civic buildings of the Empire." These 
churches and the contemporary buildings in 
Italy " were in the main the production of the 
Roman race of builders, and were in the direct 
line of succession from those of ancient Rome." 
And a remarkable fact is then stated, a fact in 
which is seen the prophecy of the Renaissance, 
that the Italian race, through all its changes 
of government and population, has adhered 
steadfastly to the classic traditions, and has 
accepted with reluctance and never with hearty 
support the styles forced upon it from without 
by Lombard, Byzantine, Norman, or the Cis- 
tercians bringing the Gothic of Northern 
France. The Gothic invasion impaired the 
chain of Roman builders, the Lombard inva- 
sion broke it absolutely ; and for six centuries, 
or till the coming of the Renaissance, the Ro- 
manesque held sway in Italy. Mr. Cummings 
speaks interestingly and with clearness con- 
cerning the term Romanesque, and after giving 
its origin, says : 

" The Romanesque, in character as well as in time, 
lies between the Roman and the Gothic, being in great 
measure an inheritance from the one, and carrying 
within itself, at least in most of its forms, the promise 
of the other. Yet Quicherat's definition as ' an archi- 
tecture which has ceased to be Roman, though it retains 
much that is Roman, and has not yet become Gothic, 
though it has already something of Gothic,' is, as far as 
its application to the Romanesque of Italy is concerned, 
certainly faulty, since it implies that all Romanesque 
is on its way to become Gothic. To the Romanesque 
of France and Germany, and to a certain extent that of 
Northern Italy, where the wooden roofs have been 
superseded by vaulting, where the walls and piers have 



been made heavy and broad to support it, and where 
the whole disposition of parts has a more or less organic 
arrangement, the definition is clearly applicable; but it 
would as certainly exclude the Romanesque of Central 
and Southern Italy, in which the internal disposition is 
essentially that of the Roman basilicas, and in which 
the ornaments and the general exterior design are the 
features which distinguish the Romanesque church from 
its Roman prototype." 

The lack of homogeneousness in the Ro 
manesque of Italy leads the author to discrim 
inate between its various geographical aspects 
and so he gives the name " Lombard Roman 
esque " to that style which developed in Milan 
Pavia, and the Lombard cities of the north of 
Italy, and that of " Central Romanesque " to 
the more classic forms which are found in 
Tuscany and the region between Tuscany and 
Rome; while that mixed style which grew up 
contemporaneously over Apulia, Calabria, and 
the other provinces of Southern Italy (a style 
in which the Lombard and the Norman had 
perhaps an equal share, and of which the 
abundant and fascinating ornament is largely 
due to the Greek sculptors by whom these 
provinces were overrun from the eighth to the 
eleventh centuries), is appropriately desig- 
nated by Mr. Cummings as the " Southern 
Romanesque." 

The Romanesque in Italy dates from the 
Lombard invasion. There has been not a 
little speculation as to how so rude a race as 
the Lombard was at the time of the invasion 
could produce so fine an architecture as the 
Lombard Romanesque. Much, without doubt, 
was due to the order of the Masistri Coma- 
cini, of which Mr. Cummings treats with neces- 
sary fulness, noting the origin of the Coma- 
cini, according to legend, on a little island 
in the Lake of Como, where an independent 
Roman Colony endured for twenty years after 
the invasion, yielding finally to the Lombards 
after a protracted siege. He then gives an 
account of the laws of the Lombards, which 
established the order of master builders, "Mag- 
istri Comacini," from among the already 
famous builders of the region, regulating its 
work and fixing a scale of payment. 

The differences between the various phases 
of the Romanesque, Mr. Cummings has set 
down clearly and in a manner full of interest ; 
but the subject necessarily receives treatment 
in such great detail as to make epitomizing a 
difficult task. In fact, the same may be said 
of the other themes which serve to mark the 
division into chapters. The meat of the Ro- 
man builders is presented with the Roman-

esque, but the wine and juices of the feast 
come with the Byzantine influence. While the 
eastern builders left in Italy no churches of 
the Byzantine type, the eastern sculptors and 
colorists left on the Italian buildings of the 
middle ages the impress of their great love for 
flowing line, free form, and brilliant color, 
with the result that from Venice to Palermo, 
through Milan, Ravenna, Rome, the Byzan- 
tine ornament in sculpture and mosaic hangs 
like rich grapes upon the vine. Only in con- 
servative Rome, where the classic spirit never 
was extinguished, is the flavor less sweet. The 
chapter on Gothic is of great interest, and is 
beautiful in its illustrations ; while that on 
Sicilian Architecture, beginning in romance 
and warmed throughout by the blood of the 
south and the east, is equally attractive in 
matter and in its illustrations. The work is 
very attractive in its make-up, both volumes 
being especially rich in illustrations, which are 
well chosen, well executed, and well printed. 
All plans and sections are in line, as are a few 
of the details; but the great majority of the 
details, and all the interior and exterior views, 
are in half-tone from photographs, many of the 
subjects 80 unhackneyed yet beautiful as to 
cause wonder that they are so little known. A 
list of over a hundred authors consulted, and 
copious foot and marginal notes with refer- 
ences, add greatly to the value of the work. 
Mr. Cummings has done a valuable service to 
the student and to the general reader in the 
production of this history,

An Optimistic View of Human Rights.* 



The problems that now confront our Amer- 
ican democracy call for renewed discussion of 
the basis of government. The fundamental 
questions of man's relation to the State and of 
the State's obligation to the individual are yet 
matters of dispute, and on the way in which 
they are to be answered will depend the solu- 
tion of much that is of vital moment in present- 
day politics. Dr. Lyman Abbott, in his dis- 
cussion of "The Rights of Man," takes up 
first " The Conflict of the Centuries," founding 
the general development of his argument on 
the thesis that the advance of society has been 
away from the autocratic idea of government 

• The Rights op Man. By Lyman Abbott. Boston : 
Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 



as exemplified by Rome, toward the democratic 
form as understood by the Hebrews. Following 
this are chapters on political, industrial, edu- 
cational, and religious rights, in the discussion 
of all of which it is maintained that no man has 
any inherent right to impose government of any 
sort upon another man, whether as king or as 
member of a democracy, save only as by such 
government greater protection in his rights is 
secured to the individual. Politically, then, 
man has a right to personal security, and only 
by the possession of an enlightened conscience 
a right to share in government. " The first 
industrial duty of society is to protect every 
man in his right to labor and in his ownership 
of the fruits of his labor." This is defined as 
an absolute right ; artificial rights, such as the 
right to land, are those established by society, 
and our present industrial system is unjust 
because it "is based upon the private owner- 
ship of common wealth." Taxation as now 
managed is also unjust, since it does not fall 
most heavily upon those whose rights are most 
in need of protection from government. As a 
remedy for these evils. Dr. Abbott gives a very 
lucid presentation of the Single Tax theory. 
Educationally, man has a right to "the devel- 
opment of his own, true, ideal, divine person- 
ality "; and religiously, " It is the right of 
man to pursue this quest [the quest for God] 
unhindered ; to find God for himself, in his 
own way, with his own faculties, after his own 
fashion." 

Having shown that a democracy is not by 
inherent right any more a just government 
than an oligarchy, he goes on to the conclusion 
that democracy is the best government because 
it more fully than any other provides for the 
intellectual and moral development of the 
people. He understands the " distinguishing 
characteristic of the American Republic as one 
embodying the spirit of faith in man, hope for 
man, and good-will toward men." The result 
of this with us he sees as a large balance on the 
side of good in our religious, political, social, 
and industrial life. More than this. Dr. Ab- 
bott finds good reason for believing that democ- 
racy is to reconstruct society, coming to the 
time when it shall embody these five principles : 
1, the diffusion of happiness ; 2, through the 
development of character ; 3, by a process of 
gradual growth ; 4, the secret thereof being 
the indwelling of God in humanity ; 6, the 
end thereof being a brotherhood of man cen- 
tred in God as the Universal Father." 

Dr. Abbott takes notice of many domestic

problems, many foreign problems, many perils. 
The Indian, the negro, the political machine, 
the boss, the plutocrat, imperialism, and the 
democratic spirit, — all these are discussed in 
the light of the general principles which have 
been carefully worked out in the preceding 
pages. The concluding paragraph of the book 
sums up its conclusions briefly : 

"The conflict of the centuries is one between the 
doctrine of pagan imperialism, that life and the world 
are made for the few, whom the many are to serve; 
and that of the Hebraic democracy, that life and the 
world are made for the many, and the great are to be 
their servants. This democratic or Hebraic or Chris- 
tian doctrine involves: in politics. All just government 
is for the benefit of the governed ; in political economy. 
The common wealth is for the benefit of the common 
people; in education, A fair opportunity for the devel- 
opment of every individual; in religion. The right of 
every soul to learn for itself what it can of the Infinite, 
and to tell what it thinks it has learned. Of the He- 
braic democracy the United States affords the best 
modern example; in the faithful application of these 
simple principles it will find the solution of its prob- 
lems, both domestic and foreign. Its perils are great, 
but the grounds for hopefulness as to the final issue are 
greater. That issue, if it be successfully achieved, in- 
volves the material welfare of all the people, based on 
their intellectual and spiritual development; the free- 
dom of the community, based on the recognition of a 
divine law enforced by reason and conscience; and a 
brotherhood of humanity, based on loyalty to one Father 
and manifested in glad service rendered by his sons as 
freemen to one another." 

As here expressed, these conclusions are 
little more than hopeful sentiments ; but they 
have been reached through a course of very 
patient reasoning, — reasoning illumined by 
the glow of a most contagious enthusiasm. 
The premise of the first chapter, that Koman 
and Hebrew political thinking were opposed 
as autocratic and democratic, may easily be 
disputed. But the validity of the argument 
does not depend upon the truth of this. Nei- 
ther does it greatly matter what has given us 
the growing sense of human brotherhood, — the 
thought of the fatherhood of God, as Dr. 
Abbott thinks, or a clearer recognition of our 
mutual interdependence. We may pass by 
these and some other personal elements in the 
discussion as being interesting, but not con- 
vincing, and there is still left a substantial 
body of thoughtful comment on the course of 
human development and present conditions. 
Students of social problems and the general 
reader should alike be grateful for so reason- 
able and stimulating a discussion of matters of 
such moment, even if in its genial optimism 
they are not at all times able to share.

Recent Books of Travel,.* 



Few books are more interesting than a good ac- 
count of travels by one who knows the folk to whom 
his book is addressed no less than the stranger folk 
of whom he writes. The interest lies in powers of 
observation and comparison, the ability to see clearly 
and to point out resemblances and di£Eerences. 
Necessarily, resemblances are many, differences 
few, and human nature is the same wherever found. 
" I have travelled far," said Lady Mary Wortley 
Montagu, " and have always seen men and women." 

Of all books recently written of journeys in 
strange or familiar lands, few surpass in interest 
Mr. Ray Stannard Baker's " Seen in Germany." 
It is informing, it is shrewd, and it is always intel- 
ligent. Best of all, it is quite free from that as- 
sumption of superiority so prevalent in accounts of 
foreign peoples as seen with " Anglo-Saxon " eyes, 
a racial habit which too often degenerates into the 
cant of patriotism. Mr. Baker was, first, an edu- 
cated man ; secondly, a man with a newspaper 
training. His acquirements have enabled him to 
see what it is his readers will enjoy, and to observe 
accurately. He does not show us the German 
people, from the Emperor to the laborer, as ignor- 
ant and foolish because they differ from Americans, 
but simply as " different," and this difference is 
shown us in a way that makes very pleasant read- 
ing. The book begins with " common things," — 
the effect of " good " government as distinguished

from " self " government, the police, politeness, 
shops, beer, the American circus in Berlin, notions 
about Americans, machinery. Successive chapters 
are devoted to the Kaiser, to the private soldier, to 
the workingman, to a typical student in the person 
of Professor Ernst Haeckel, to a typical scientific 
institute as it may be seen at Charlottenburg, to 
the glass-works at Jena and Professor Abbe's profit- 
sharing system, to shipbuilding at Stettin, to the 
novelties in German education like the new com- 
mercial university at Leipzig, to duelling among 
university students, and to the problems of the 
" new " Germany. Mr. George Varian has pro- 
vided numerous drawings for the book, which is 
one to be heartily commended. 

For several years the American consul at the 
capital of Greece, no one speaks of that land with 
more authority than Mr. George Horton ; and his . 
" Modern Athens " affords an entertaining picture 
of one of the least known and most worth knowing 
cities of Europe. The narrative is one in which 
the writer admits his readers freely into intimacy 
with the modern Greek, his virtues, his foibles, his 
life at home and in the public streets, in summer 
and winter, in peace and war. It is difficult to 
realize that there is a country on earth in which 
ancient Greek of the best classical period is readily 
understood by the common people, where Homer 
stands nearer popular comprehension than Chaucer 
among English-speaking folk and is read generally 
by " the man in the street "; but Mr. Horton shows 
us these things are facts. " Coming from the 
quaint, mediaeval quarter into a London or German 
emporium on Stadium Street," says Mr. Horton, 
" is like jumping from the Middle Ages into the 
present century "; and he goes on to describe the 
Athenian method of shopping : 

"The Oriental method of doing business still prevails. 
The dealer sets a price, the buyer another, and often three 
or four hours of patient ■will-contest pass before a compromise 
is reached. The patron asks ' How is this piece of silk ? ' 
* One dollar a yard,' is the reply. ' Thirty cents ' is offered. 
The merchant is thrown into something: resembling an apo- 
plectic fit. He swears by his father's soul that it cost ninety- 
five cents. The lady takes a seat with a sigh, and after 
twenty minutes, inquires, innocently, ' Finally, thirty cents ? ' 
' Never I But to keep you and not lose your custom, you may 
have it for what I paid, ninety-five cents.' 'KaiemeniP 
sighs the lady, sarcastically (You poor thing) ! There are a 
dozen or more women sitting about the store. When finally 
the proprietor comes down to a price that one is willing to 
pay, she rises, receives her bundle, and departs, declaring, 
good-naturedly, that she has been swindled, and that she will 
never come back again." 

The book is well illustrated with drawings by Mr. 
Corwin Knapp Linson, from photographs taken by 
Mr. Horton, and is worth possessing. 

Mr. Julius Chambers has sought to make his 
account of a journey through Spain and Italy and 
Egypt more entertaining by weaving into it a pretty 
love-story, indicated by the title, " The Destiny of 
Doris." In the first chapter the teller of the story 
( it is in the first person) meets the mother of Doris, 
an old flame now widowed, on the steamer bound 



for the Mediterranean ; in the third chapter, Vernon 
Blake joins Doris at Gibraltar ; in the intervening 
chapters, Blake makes love to Doris and the nar- 
rator to her mother ; in the last chapter there is, as 
Mr. Chambers phrases it, " a quatrain of destiny." 
Making love over parts of three continents must be 
very good fun, and Mr. Chambers sees to it that 
no chance is omitted to supply sound information — 
somewhat Baedekerish at times, but often original 
in its conclusions, as in the estimate made of Gen- 
eral Gordon while in the Soudan : 

" His bravery, his conscientious sense of duty to the gar- 
risons he had taken over, and his fidelity unto death to the 
Arabs who stood by him, is [sic] beyond question. His size 
was that of a regimental, or brigade, commander. He was 
not equal to the government of a province. His Chinese rec- 
ord as a commander who struck promptly and with awe- 
inspiring severity, was nullified by his year's shilly-shallying 
at Khartum. As I stood on the top of the Serail, — where he 
had stood so often during those long and agonizing months of 
suspense, — and gazed over the surrounding country for miles, 
I could only marvel that Gordon had held out against the 
Mahdi as long as he had. The possibilities of defending the 
promontory from artillery-fire are meagre. I understood 
perfectly what Lord Milner meant by describing the imprac- 
ticable Arab chieftain. Wad el Nejumi, who tried to lead an 
army across the Nubian desert into Egypt, as ' the Gordon of 
Mahdiism.' " 

There are numerous reproduced photographs to add 
to the desirability of the book ; and it may be freely 
admitted that Mr. Chambers's experiment of writing 
a book of travel with an abundance of " heart in- 
terest " is successful. 

It is difficult to extract anything new from a 
voyage in a dahabSah up the Nile, but " Our House- 
boat on the Nile" is not without interest, if lacking 
in originality. Mrs. Lee Bacon tells the story, and 
her husband, Mr. Henry Bacon, furnishes a number 
of delicate drawings for illustrations, the frontis- 
piece in color being exceptionally beautiful. It 
shows the wonderful fagade of the temple at Abou 
Sembel, with its repeated statue-portraits of Ra- 
meses II., described by Mrs. Bacon thus : 

" The hand of time has touched the facade of the temple 
sufficiently to add to its beauty rather than detract from it. 
Instead of four colossal seated figures, as the children would 
say, ' pin for pin alike,' with four heads wearing crowns, eight 
legs, and ever so many fingers and toes in exact rows, the end 
of the nineteenth century sees one figure broken away down 
to the waist, three out of the four crowns gone, one set of 
legs crumbled away ; a most picturesque ensemble. The 
proportions, the architecture, and the sculpture are what at 
first hold one spellbound ; later the beauty of the faces, the 
generosity of the great six-feet-wide mouths, kind, calm, 
benign. The crown lies broken at the feet of the figure, 
which is itself broken away. Why is it that the three re- 
maining figures are more beautiful than four could ever have 
been ? Why is the number three as subtly beautiful in ar- 
chitecture as it is fraught with grace in music ? ' ' 

This extract will give a better idea of the real 
charm in the book than much description. A 
simple, cultivated style, a keen sense of the humor- 
ous, and great kindliness of heart, make the narra- 
tive exceptionally readable.

Syracuse, and the rest divided between Castrogio- 
vanni, the centre of the sulphur trade, and the cap- 
ital of the island province, Palermo. The story of 
this storied soil is told with sympathy and vivacity, 
as may be seen in an extract from the description 
of the Capella Palatina at Palermo, built by Roger II. 
in 1132, as follows : 

" If I told you that the beauty of the famous Easter can- 
dlestick, ivhich stands fourteen feet high and came from 
Constantinople, although it was carved by Norman workmen, 
almost brought tears to my eyes, you would say that I had 
been reading Kuskin, and undermining my constitution by a 
prolonged diet of slaughtered kid ; and I wonder what idea 
you would carry away of the marble pulpit if I were fool 
enough to tell you the truth : that it is one of the pulpits built 
by those earnest men of long ago, who thought that no stone 
was too rare or priceless, no time too long, no money too much 
to devote to the beautifying of a throne from which the word 
of God was to be preached. These mediaeval artists seem to 
me to have been men sent by God to beautify His sanctuaries 
on earth. They were divinely inspired for divine art. The 
chapel is small, and it is so full of such priceless marbles that 
I should not have been surprised if it had been guarded night 
and day by a piquet of soldiers, for if such a glorious thing 
as the priceless Easter candlestick was ever mutilated and 
carried off, the jewel of Sicily would be despoiled." 

There is a colored frontispiece after a painting by 
Miss Margaret Thomas, with several other excel- 
lent illustrations from photographs. At the close 
of the story a pleasant bit of romance is woven in 
for good measure, adding greatly to the charm of 
the book. 

Mr. Rider Haggard evidently enjoyed his " Win- 
ter Pilgrimage," the only drawbacks to complete 
happiness being the mistakes which the foreigners 
insisted upon making from time to time, — exactly 
the sort of thing an American complains of in En- 
gland, for example. The book is readable, but it 
owes a great deal of its best thought and matter to 
the inspiration of Baedeker. The following obser- 
vation, made in Cyprus, is more original : 

"Nicosia is a place of many amusements. Thus, they 
play golf there on a course of nine holes. It is odd to do the 
round with a gentleman in a fez acting as your caddie, and to 
observe upon the greens — or the yellows, for they are made 
of sand — Turkish ladies veiled in yashmaks engaged in the 
useful tasks of brushing and weeding. What in their secret 
hearts do the denizens of the harem think of us, I wonder ? 
Would not their verdict, if we could get at it, be ' Mad, mad, 
my masters ' ? But English folk would celebrate book-teas 
and play golf or any other accustomed game upon the brink 
of Styx. Perhaps that is why they remain a ruling race." 

Mr. Haggard went from Italy to Cyprus, and thence 
to Palestine. He was an observant, if insular trav- 
eller, and decidedly skeptical regarding the authen- 
ticity of holy places and relics. But he avers, in 
closing, that he bad a good time ; and the reflection 
of it is in these pages, plentifully illustrated, as 
usual, with reproduced photographs. 

That excellent book of Miss Ella C. Sykes's, 
" Through Persia on a Side-Saddle," has been re- 
vised and republished, with a new introduction 
by Major-General Sir Frederic Goldsmid, C.B., 
K.C.S.I., in which there will be found an explana- 
tion of one of the border disputes in which Persia 
is interested and strong commendation of the work 



of Miss Sykes as accurate. The revision of the 
text appears to have been limited to minor matters, 
and di£Eer8 in no essential way from that of the 
first edition several years ago. Miss Sykes's journey 
through the East was completed in 1896, and events 
have been marching with singular rapidity for the 
Orient ever since ; but of the extension of Russian 
influence in the Shah's dominions, no account is 
taken here. The maps and pictures of the earlier 
edition suffer no change ; but the book loses noth- 
ing of human interest, except in a political sense, 
through the years which have elapsed. 

" On the Great Highway," by Mr. James C. 
Creelman, is something more than a mere book of 
travel, though its author fairly journeys around the 
world in its pages. But as a special correspondent 
for one or another New York newspaper, his vari- 
ous expeditions were undertaken only when im- 
portant news was forthcoming, and his presence in 
the various kingdoms and principalities he mentions 
was usually of a stormy-petrel character. The 
only newspaper man to be accorded an interview 
with the Pontiff of the Church of Rome, he rightly 
places his account of that event at the opening of 
his narrative, following it with the establishment 
of another record in the interview he had with the 
King of Corea. The war between China and Japan 
for the mastery of Eastern Asia is followed from 
Corea to the mainland ; and the battle of Port 
Arthur, with the massacre which followed, is de- 
scribed with vivid effect. Thence there is a swift 
passage to Count Tolstoy, and an extended interview 
had with that apostle of peace. The book is one 
of quick transitions and strong contrasts, the next 
figure being that of General Weyler, " The Butcher," 
as Mr. Creelman calls him, whose wreath of poison 
ivy some of the American generals in the Philip- 
pines seem trying to wrest from his brow. An 
interesting chapter on " yellow journalism " follows, 
with this justification, unfortunate in its opening 
sentences, but none the less significant : 

" If the war against Spain is justified in the eyes of his- 
tory, then ' yellow journalism ' deserves its place among the 
most useful instrumentalities of civilization. It may be 
guilty of giving the world a lop-sided view of events by ex- 
aggerating the importance of a few things and ignoring 
others, it may offend the eye by typographical violence ; it 
may sometimes proclaim its own deeds too loudly ; but it has 
never deserted the cause of the poor and the downtrodden ; 
it has never taken bribes, — and that is more than can be 
said of its most conspicuous critics." 

Some part of this estimate may be applied to Mr. 
Creelman's own work. He is evidently not of a 
retiring disposition, — else his occupation would be 
gone. But he is interesting, whether talking about 
others, or, more frequently, about himself. The 
book is illustrated with portraits of many of the 
persons mentioned, reproduced from photographs. 
Iron rails and iron steamships took Miss Annette 
M. B. Meakin from London to St. Petersburg,

Liverpool, and so back to the place of beginning.

as the lawyers say ; but it is her experience in 
crossing Europe and Asia on the great Russian 
railway line that gives title to her book, " A Ribbon 
of Iron." Miss Meakin left the British metropolis 
March 18, 1900, and returned to that spot August 
31, having spanned the whole round world in that 
space of five months and thirteen days, without 
haste or hardship. She was in Blagovestchensk on 
June 28, only four days before the firing of the 
shot which led to the most dreadful of modern 
massacres. While in the city she was told by the 
manager of the hotel that war between Russia and 
China was imminent. " There seem to be as many 
Chinamen as Russians in this town," she remarked ; 
"What will happen to them if there is a war?" 
" The moment war is declared they will all have to 
leave," he replied, " every one of them." And so 
it proved ; but their souls left, not their bodies. 
The neighboring city of Aigun, inhabited chiefly 
by Chinese, was wiped off the earth. Our author 
bought a photograph of a local dignitary, of which 
she remarks : 

" As we were steaming down the Amur, I took the photo- 
graph and wrote on the back, ' Governor of Aigun, Chinese 
town on the Amur.' 

"To-day there is no Aigun, and no Governor! " 
The story is a simple one, conveying successfully 
the freshness of the youthful author's impressions ; 
and it is well illustrated. 

The interest taken in Afghanistan, through the 
death, in October, 1901, of the Amir Abdurrah- 
man, and the enthronement of his son Habibullah 
in his stead, has led to a republication of Doctor 
John Alfred Gray's intensely interesting volume 
entitled " At the Court of the Amir," first given 
the reading world in 1895, narrating his extended 
sojourn in that troubled land as a physician at- 
tached to the native court. A new preface has 
been written for this edition, in which the recent 
change of rulers is dwelt upon briefly ; but the in- 
trinsic merit of the narrative loses nothing by the 
lapse of time, and the book may be read for the 
actual fascination in its pages. Doctor Gray was 
in Kabul many months before the great Amir's 
health was entrusted to his skill, the royal patron- 
age being withdrawn soon after through the machi- 
nations of a designing and worthless Hindoo. 
When illness attacked the monarch again, the 
Englishman saw that he should not be called in 
until the native Hakim, or physicians, had brought 
the Amir almost to the point of death, and that the 
blame for Abdurrahman's death, which would be 
likely to follow as a matter of course, would be 
laid at his door. He therefore resigned his some- 
what thankless position, after a residence in Afghan- 
istan from March, 1889, to May, 1892, interrupted 
by a vacation of eight months in England. Of 
the last Amir a most fascinating portrait is painted, 
leaving no doubt of the man's inherent nobility and 
power. Not much is said of the new ruler, but of 
his father this anecdote is told : 

" His Highness had heard that I was ill, and I told him I 



had not with me the medicine I wished to take. His High- 
ness asked. Would I take native medicine if he prescribed 
it ? I said I should be most grateful to His Highness if he 
would honor me so far. His Highness gave some directions 
to a Hakim, who presently brought a small jar. With a little 
silver spoon he took some dark-looking confection out of the 
jar, made a bolus of it, and gave it to me. It tasted hot and 
very nice. There was no more in the pot, and he sent the 
Hakim away to make some fresh. It was then that my 
mind became troubled in me, for I knew the Hakim loved 
me not. 

" Presently the jar was brought back, and as they were 
about to give it me. His Highness asked for it. He scooped 
a little out with a spoon, and was raising it to his lips, when 
the Hakim stopped him and whispered in his ear. The Amir 
turned and looked at hira, and the Hakim hurried away with 
a very red face. By-and-bye he returned with the jar. 
Again the Amir took it, and looking at me, he raised a spoon- 
ful to his lips and swallowed it. . . . To appreciate fully 
the honor he did me, one must be conversant with Oriental 
customs. To taste a medicine before handing it to the pa- 
tient is the duty of an Oriental physician when he is attend- 
ing the King. I was a servant — but also a stranger and a 
guest — and the Amir treated me as though I had been a 
Prince." 

Doctor Gray was also a painter in oils, and a pho- 
togravure from the portrait he made of the late 
Amir serves as a frontispiece here. 

Mrs. Fanny Bullock Workman and Doctor 
William Hunter Workman, to follow the order of 
the names on the title-page of their interesting ac- 
count of mountain climbing and exploration " In 
the Ice World of Himalaya," succeeded in con- 
quering several peaks of the great Asiatic range 
which had never known the foot of man before. 
These are in the Skoro La circle, and were ap- 
proached from the Shigar Valley during the sum- 
mer of 1899 ; Zurbriggen, a noted Swiss guide, 
being in the party. The most notable ascent is 
described as follows : 

" We reached the top, 19,450 feet, at ten o'clock, four 
hours from camp, which time in no way represents the diffi- 
culties of the ascent, which began at Avalanche Camp, seven 
to eight hours below. . . . Speaking from the point of 
view of ordinary Alpinists, whose knowledge is born of expe- 
rience with many of the best known mountains of Switzer- 
land, Tyrol, the Dolomites, and some of the numerous 
untrodden ones of the Himalayas, we should say, unless the 
climbers are experts, this is not a mountain to be attempted 
without a competent guide. 

" We ate our breakfast with good appetites, and, except 
for some headache and loss of breath on sudden exertion, 
suffered in no way from the altitude. . . . We named the 
peak Mt. Bullock Workman, and left our cards, with name 
given and record of ascent, in a glass jar, in the snow at the 
highest point. The temperature at ten o'clock was 56 Fahr., 
about the same as on the Siegfriedhorn." 

Numerous descriptions of native life separate the 
accounts of the several mountains ascended, and 
there are numerous photographs in half-tone repro- 
duction. There is a map and a glossary of native 
words, but no index. 

Mr. William Carey has gathered together such 
facts as have been well authenticated by way of 
introduction to "Adventures in Tibet," the only 
new matter in the handsome volume being the 
transcriptions from the diary of Miss Annie R.

one route and out by another during the years

1892-3 in a manner nothing less than remarkable. 
Her account of her own journey, written in pencil 
in a note-book day by day during her travels, has 
the merit of being entirely unadorned, though seri- 
ously injured through her lack of comparative 
knowledge, — in fact, missionary zeal led her into 
undertaking a task nothing less than preposterous, 
and she seems to have accepted hardship with the 
resignation of the early Christian martyrs. Miss 
Taylor left the Chinese frontier city of Tau-Chau 
September 2, 1892, by stealth, and promptly ran 
into a nest of brigands. Her escort of five men 
dwindled to one, and all the pack-horses died ; but 
such reflections as " I am God's little woman, and 
He will take care of me," sustained her until she 
was within three days' journey of Lhassa, the cap- 
ital city. Here she was arrested and held for fif- 
teen days, during which she was continually fighting 
for her own life and the lives of the two servants 
with her, being unarmed, and without food, except 
as her captors provided her. In her darkest mo- 
ments, with her life lawfully forfeit to her judges, 
she calmly wrote, " Quite safe here with Jesus," — 
and the sequel justified her faith. She was turned 
back, it is true, but not until her captors had re- 
turned to her all her confiscated property, together 
with " a tent, horses, and provisions sufficient for 
the return to China." She reached Ta-Chien-Lu 
April 13, 1893, the months she passed in Tibet 
being the least endurable of the year. Her own 
narrative, though made readable and consecutive by 
Mr. Carey's careful editing, is not as interesting as 
his summary of it, and has no scientific value, 
though she traversed, in part, territory quite un- 
known to Europeans. There are a few photo- 
graphs and several rough drawings by Miss Taylor 
herself, by way of illustrations. 

Mr. E. H. Parker's " John Chinaman and a Few 
Others " is a book of many delights. Its theme, 
as far as it has one, is the demonstration of the 
humanity, even from the Anglo-Saxon point of 
view, of the Chinese of all sorts and conditions. A 
keen sense of humor, a quick sympathy, a complete 
grasp of the universality of man's shortcomings, 
and a ready pen, make this a book from which no 
one can arise without refreshment, both mental and 
spiritual. Mr. Parker was consul at various places 
in the Orient, and his life has been devoted to the 
service of the British Crown ; but the book will be 
laid down with the feeling that he would have 
made a notable missionary in the usual sense of the 
word; no one better calculated to give the China- 
man a decent idea of the European can be imag- 
agined. There is not a trace of the tendency to 
contrast a Chinese mob with a fashionable Euro- 
pean church congregation, nor to expect rather 
more of a Chinese servant than from a European 
ambassador ; nor is there, on the other hand, any 
attempt to set the better sort of Chinese on a ped- 
estal as an example for the worse sort of European 
to profit by. Having lived in China and the East 



long enough to learn that the majority of the hu- 
man race there is full as manly, as womanly, and 
as childlike as the minority which chances to be 
born in Europe or America, he takes it for granted 
that his readers are quite as familiar as he with 
this self-evident truth, and proceeds to share the 
joys and sorrows through which he passed while 
among the yellow-skinned people with his fellow- 
whites. The book is composed of incidents ar- 
ranged under minor headings into chapters, but is 
altogether informal in arrangement as in style. It 
is anecdotical to a degree, and the anecdotes are 
new. All are worth reading, but to Americans 
this is perhaps the best : 

" No foreigner haa ever yet succeeded in obtaining a Chi- 
nese degree, nor is it at all likely that any one has tried ; but 
as special arrangements are made for Miao-tsz [a sort of 
gipsy] and other tribes, it is not improbable that a European 
student would be admitted if he went through the usual cur- 
riculum. On the other hand, both Chinese and Japanese 
have shown that they possess the requisite mental capacity 
to obtain English degrees, and to pass the Inns of Court ex- 
aminations for call to the bar. When it is considered that, 
in order to do this, the Oriental must have some knowledge 
of Roman as well as of English history, it becomes evident 
that, besides mastering Law, a Chinese who can pass for call 
must possess considerable intellectual power. 

"One of the students at the Middle Temple in 1876 was 
Ng Choy (the Cantonese way of pronouncing Wu Ts'ai). 
The Wu family of Canton, to which it is almost certain Mr. 
Wu must be more or less distantly related, is no other than 
the ' Howqua ' of old Co-hone days ; and I suppose ' Howqua ' 
may be a Portuguese attempt to render the syllables Ng-ka, 
or ' Wu family.' Archdeacon Gray several times took me to 
see the family mansion. Mr. Ng, after being called to the 
bar, returned to Hongkong, where he practised for a time 
before the Supreme Court there. Before long his services 
were requisitioned by Li Hung-chang at Tientsin, where he 
remained for many years as legal adviser, and thus obtained 
formal entrance into the Chinese public service. He is no 
other than Wu T'ing-fang, the present able Minister at 
Washington. . . . When a Chinese becomes a mandarin, 
he adopts an official ' Christian ' name, and T'ing-fang or 
'hall fragrance,' is accordingly the bureaucratic designa- 
tion of Ng Choy ; the idea is that of a statesman, the sweet- 
smelling savor of whose reputation ' fills the court.' " 

The pictures in Mr. Parker's eminently readable 
book are of the same nature as the text : seen 
through his eyes, the most obtuse observer can as- 
sure himself that there are at least as many kinds 
of Chinaman, good, bad and indifferent, as there 
are of Caucasians. Wallace Rice.

gouleme. It is not the author's purpose to give 
anything like a full and connected picture of the 
Renaissance in France, but only to illumine " a 
little corner of it" principally contained within the 
limits of the reign of Francis I. ; and even within 
this portion not to follow closely the movement of 
ideas or events, nor to penetrate their inner con- 
nections, but only to " recall a few of the less 
known figures " of that day. This modest purpose 
has been achieved with reasonable success. We 
have accordingly not a historical or critical study, 
but a little gallery of portraits, most of them 
sketches rather than finished paintings, done with 
an alert pen and with a just perception of the 
salient features. In the foreground beside Marga- 
ret are her mother, Louise de Savoie, her daughter, 
Jeanne d'Albret, and her brother, Francis I. ; and 
about her come and go the men and women, 
scholars, artists, poets, beauties, wits, who made 
the epoch, — Charles V., Henri d'Albret, Madame 
d'Etampes, Diane de Poitiers, Marot, des Pdriers, 
du Bellay, Ronsard, Dolet, Erasmus, Rabelais, 
Benvenuto Cellini, Philibert de I'Orme, Pierre 
Lescot, Jean Goujon, and a host of others. Indeed, 
80 many and so various are the figures that hasten 
across the field of vision that the effect is a little 
kaleidoscopic. Some preliminary chapters furnish 
a background by setting forth the general condi- 
tions of the society of the Renaissance, the main 
current of its ideas, and its historical connection 
with the past. It is perhaps inseparable from the 
plan of the book, perhaps also in a measure due to 
the character of the period, that the general 
impression it leaves is somewhat confused, fragmen- 
tary, and disconnected. But there is much infor- 
mation in the book, and it may be read with pleas- 
ure and profit by any who seek an agreeable 
introduction to the first half of the sixteenth cen- 
tury in France. The serious student will go at 
once to the sources from which it has been drawn. 
The mechanical execution of the book is excellent, 
and its attractive pages are freer from misprints 
than is often the case with books containing so 
many foreign names and quotations. There are, 
however, a few rather irritating ones, — for in- 
stance, Causeries de lundi (p. 226). And one 
wonders whether the long-suffering " proof-reader " 
could be justly held responsible for making the 
title of du Bellay's well-known dainty lines read in 
English " A Sower of Corn, to the winds." 

Mr. Garrett P. Serviss is well known 
ft^lltarpianL. ^« «" entertaining writer upon popu- 

lar themes in astronomy, and his 
latest work, " Other Worlds " ( Appleton) will add 
to his reputation as a trustworthy popularizer of 
one of the most abstruse of the sciences. His aim, in 
the book before us, is to present an account of the 
planets of the solar system from the standpoint of 
their habitability. While freely admitting that 
intelligence may exist in worlds which are quite 
unfit for human habitation, Mr. Serviss refuses to 



be drawn aside into fruitless speculations on such 
matters, and confines himself to the simple question 
whether our planets are at present suited to the 
support of such life as exists upon the earth. One 
by one, from coy Mercury to slow-footed Neptune, 
the major planets are passed in review, and the 
latest and most authoritative observations of the 
appearances and physical conditions of these bodies 
are discussed in a fair-minded judicial fashion. 
The asteroids and the satellites of the planets are 
also considered ; an entire chapter is devoted to an 
admirable description of conditions at the surface 
of our moon. Flights of fancy are not wanting, 
but they are founded upon fairly well established 
facts, and add to the charm of the writer's treat- 
ment of the subject. Even professional astrono- 
mers, who usually have scant patience with specu- 
lations concerning the habitability of other worlds, 
will find little to criticise, even when the author 
touches upon such a theme as the possibility of 
aereal navigation upon Venus. Occasionally full 
credence is given to supposed discoveries which 
have not yet been verified; an instance of this is 
found on page 195, where the ninth satellite of Sat- 
urn is mentioned. The concluding chapter con- 
tains six charts showing the chief stars of the 
zodiacal constellations ; these are to be used in 
connection with the Nautical Almanac or some 
other source of information with reference to the 
apparent positions of the planets in the heavens. 
Thus the reader may acquaint himself with them, 
and watch their wanderings in starry fields.

(Putnam), gives us all the pleasure of imagining 
we are thinking, without the fatiguing exertion of 
thought. How trite, yet how true, are his obser- 
vations on the hideous designs of much of our wall- 
paper ; and what responsive chords he touches in 
alluding to its effect upon us in hours of sickness 
when we are condemned to lie with eyes riveted 
upon its floral monstrosities and its absurdly im- 
possible foliage ! And yet, to do him justice, he is 
occasionally thought-provoking, and even instruc- 
tive. " The choice of colours for our rooms," he 
says, " demands the greatest care. Red, without 
affecting men as it affects bulls, stimulates them to 
energetic action, or at least to movement, to such 
an extent that in Germany red has been employed 
in certain factories as a filip to activity ! " In his 
philosophy of life he finds love to be the all-important 
thing. " We must love something, but what? " he 
asks ; and then, like the true Frenchman that he 
is, sends us to woman to round out and complete 
our lives. Indeed, as might have been expected

Animal life 
of long ago. 



The story of the rocks is one in 
which the leaves are turned but 
slowly, and, like the palimpsest, the 
writing must often be restored before the untrained 
reader can scan the tale. It is the dragon chapter 
which Professor H. G. Seeley has given us in his 
"Dragons of the Air " (Appleton), an account of 
extinct flying reptiles. The author is the authority 
upon Pterodactyles, and gave to the public the re- 
sults of his many years of investigation in a series 
of lectures now presented in book form. The work 
is in the main technical, intended for the palaeon- 
tologist, though the broader phases of the subject 
are not neglected. Thus the habits and affinities 
of these ancestral forms are discussed and the prin- 
ciples of palseontological interpretation are eluci- 
dated. — Of a more popular vein is " Animals of the 
Past" (McClure, Phillips & Co.), from the pen of 
Mr. F. A. Lucas, one of the curators of the United 
States National Museum. His connection with this 
public institution has given the author an excellent 
opportunity to find out the lives of public interest 
in palaeontology, and his book answers many ques- 
tions concerning fossils, their methods of forma- 
tion, their affinities and their meaning. Popular 
misconceptions, such as fossil men and living mam- 
moths, are explained, and an effort is made to give 
the real facts concerning the size and nature of ex- 
tinct monsters. The illustrations in this book are 
noteworthy — since they combine the scientific im- 
agination of the author and the artistic skill of 
Mr. Charles R. Knight. The author's style is free 
and easy, and he has furnished a very readable 
book. Each chapter closes with a few references 
to pertinent literature of reliable character, and the 
museums are noted in which the best examples of 
the animals described may be seen. 

HfeofVietoHa, The Marquis of Lome (now His 
hy one of her Grace the Duke of Argyll) was a 

axon family. ^^^^ appropriate person to be selected 

to write a life of the late Queen Victoria. A son- 
in-law of the great queen, he was familiar with her 
home-life — one of the best indexes of character in 
any person. " V. R. I. Queen Victoria, her Life 
and Empire " (Harper) is a well-written, eminently 
readable biography. It traces the great queen from 
her early days, through her whole long career, to 
her demise ; devoting by far the larger part of the 
book to her life anterior to the death of the Prince 
Consort in 1861. The author handles his material 
with wisdom and a due sense of proportion, though 
the reader would often be greatly delighted if he 
could obtain a little fuller picture of political affairs 
as seen from the palace. Of course, the picture as 
given is mainly that seen and painted by the royalty, 



but its dimness is often a source of disappointment. 
After the death of Prince Albert, Queen Victoria 
showed the hardiest heroism. The affairs of state, 
as the years grew on, became more and more com- 
plicated. The events on the European continent 
and in Asia, between the seventies and eighties, 
among Germany, France, Russia, and the East, 
added greatly to her burdens of state. But she 
was brave, heroic, and full of faith. Her voice was 
ever against war, and for everything that made for 
peace. The last years of the Queen were full of 
pathos, well described in this volume, and affec- 
tionately appropriate. 

The study of Professor Charles R. Henderson's 

dependent and " Introduction to the Study of the 
delinquent classes. Dependent, Delinquent, and Defec- 
tive Classes, and of their Social Treatment " 
(Heath) provides material that should awaken the 
interest of intelligent philanthropy, and undertakes 
" to aid educated social leaders to enter upon a 
method of study which will conduct them to codi- 
fied results of wide experience and investigation, so 
that they may think more effectively, observe more 
shrewdly, and cooperate in the wisest methods of 
action." Naturally, such a book must have more 
than a passing interest for every thoughtful per- 
son who concerns himself about the welfare of his 
less fortunate fellow-men. The book is intended, 
primarily, as a text-book for colleges and univer- 
sities ; but its scope and purpose are much wider. 
The author has divided his work into four parts, — 
" The Phenomena of Dependence and their Expla- 
nation," " Social Organization for the Relief and 
Care of Dependents," " Social Arrangements for 
the Education, Relief, Care, and Custody of De- 
fectives," and " An Introduction to Criminal Soci- 
ology." An appendix gives valuable suggestions 
to the student, indicates what authorities can be 
consulted if further investigations are desired, gives 
brief summaries of measurements, several valuable 
tables, and copious references in support of the 
text. The questions discussed show mature judg- 
ment, painstaking investigations, careful study of 
the best literature of the time, and a happy faculty 
of presenting ideas and conclusions succinctly and 
yet in a manner likely to provoke further inves- 
tigation on the part of the inquiring mind. 



In the opening of his compact biog- 
m'of^^T^" ^*P^y ^^ Washington Irving in 

the Riverside Biographical Series 
(Houghton), Mr. Henry W. Boynton tells us that 
Irving's " original publishers are now selling, year 
by year, more of his books than ever before." 
This is interesting as a bit of literary statistics ; 
but when, interpreting for us, he adds, " There is 
little doubt that his work is still widely read, and 
read not because it is prescribed, but because it 
gives pleasure ; not as the product of a ' standard 
author,' but as the expression of a rich and engag- 
ing personality, which has written itself like an

endorsement across the face of a young nation's 
literature," there will doubtless be many to raise dis- 
senting voice. By Mr. Boynton's own showing, the 
larger body of Irving's work is, if not exactly me- 
chanical, at least lacking in the fire of genius. He 
also makes it clear that, while Irving was not quite a 
dilletante in his attitude toward literature and life, 
his inspiration was rather that of sentiment than 
passion. We need not insist too much on the 
strenuous life to make it apparent that the impress 
of such a personality through its own immediate 
power is not likely to be great upon the reading 
world to-day. For the purposes of this brief biog- 
raphy, however, it is well that the author thinks 
otherwise. His enthusiasm for his subject, the easy 
fluency of his style, his nice sense of proportion, 
make the book a very pleasant volume for a winter 
evening by the fire. As ^biography, it is perhaps 
better reading than Irving's own life of Washing- 
ton, and the reader may have more assurance of 
his author's accuracy. 



Oarden-making 
on wallt 
and water. 



If we were not over-civilized, it is 
not likely we should yearn for such 
an admixture of nature and art as is 
implied in Miss Gertrude Jekyll's " Wall and Water 
Gardens" (imported by Scribner). It is one of 
several score of recent works of its kind, and shows 
that the subject has become one for specialization 
in limiting itself to the consideration of " simple 
ways of using some of the many beautiful mountain 
plants and the plants of marsh and water." As in 
most works on horticulture, it is written by an 
amateur for amateurs, and has in consequence a 
literary flavor throughout the text, the bolus of in- 
struction being made palatable thereby. The walls 
referred to are not necessarily those of houses ; 
many of them, in fact, are what are called "fences " 
in New England, and most of them are erected in 
spots that need that sort of beautification. Nor 
are the waters spoken of necessarily natural 
streams; small ponds and pools, tubs even, will 
suffice for implanting aquatic plants and lending 
variety to the scene. There is due recognition of 
the formal gardening that is coming into fashion 
once more, and the book is both thorough and sin- 
cere without being technical. It is embellished with 
many half-tone reproductions of photographs, and 
will be treasured by the amateur gardeners and 
nature-lovers for whom it is designed. 

The priestly Advanced students of the Bible are 

element in the differentiating the various elements 
Old Testament. ^f jjg literature, its religion, and its 
philosophy, so that thereby they may be the better 
prepared to appreciate the development of the 
nation in the midst of which these different ideas 
grew up. " The Priestly Element in the Old Testa- 
ment " (University of Chicago Press), by President 
W. R. Harper, is a series of constructive studies for 
advanced Bible classes. It is essentially a student's 
book, analyzed for elaborate work with copious 



references to scripture texts, and many solid pages 
of references to English, German, French, and other 
literature on the themes under discussion. These 
scripture and outside references are ample for the 
most ambitious student of this theme. Fart I. deals 
with the general scope of the priestly element ; 
Part II. with the history of worship in the earlier, 
middle, and later Old Testament periods — accord- 
ing to the arrangement of the history on the modern 
evolutionary hypothesis. Part III. is a compara- 
tive study of the laws and usages of worship. These 
pertain to the priest, the place of worship, sacrifice, 
feasts, the Sabbath and kindred institutions, clean 
and unclean, and prayer and related forms of wor- 
ship. The book is not intended for, neither will it 
prove to be, interesting reading. It is first and 
last an outline, such as can be most profitably used 
by students in investigative work. 

Rtuhin'g Foremost among the men who have 

principle* of contributed toward the two coOrdin- 

art-cnitcism. ^^.g movements that are destined to 

make the twentieth century illustrious was John 
Buskin. A social reformer as well as an art critic, 
he stood chief among those who have insisted upon 
the incorporation of Christian principles into ordi- 
nary business relations, and upon the application of 
art to common life. The principles of these reforms 
have so saturated society that they are now accepted 
by many persons who have never read Ruskin's 
books, and who would be dismayed in contemplation 
of the shelf-full of volumes in which they are im- 
bedded. A volume of " Ruskin's Principles of Art 
Criticism," compiled by Miss Ida M. Street and 
published by H. S. Stone & Co., performs a real 
service in selecting and classifying and arranging 
the most fundamental of his utterances, prefacing 
each group with an adequate though brief introduc- 
tion concerning the special point of view. The pre- 
dominant note in Ruskin's teaching, whether in art 
or political economy, is -a spiritual one, as opposed 
to the materialism of the eighteenth and of the first 
half of the nineteenth centuries. Both as editor and 
expositor. Miss Street has brought this spiritual 
meaning clearly to the reader, and the work is to 
be commended as one of the best of its kind. 



No one has done more to draw the 
National parks attention of the public to the desira-

buity and necessity of forest preser- 
vation than Mr. John Muir, the " veteran of the 
Sierras," whose recent book on " Our National 
Parks " (Houghton, Mifflin & Co.) embodies some 
of his most trenchant appeals for public interest 
and legislative action. The forest reservations, 
now 80 extensive, and our great national parks, the , 
breathing-places for the people, owe much to his 
untiring efforts. Nature wild and free is Mr. 
Muir's delight, and he takes his readers through 
these great public parks and reservations, many of 
which are as yet but little known, with a sympathy 
which inspires and an enthusiasm which is conta-

gious. He rejoices in the flowers, the wild beasts 
are his friends. He delights in the trees, and 
worships the sequoid — and who would not bow at 
such a shrine ? The prophet of the big trees is as 
free and unrestrained in his marshalling of adjec- 
tives as he is in his lonely travels in the Sierras, 
and his descriptions are as unconventional as the 
waterfall or the mountain peak which charms. 
Perhaps life in the open conduces to breeziness of 
style. 

The latest volume in the " Library 
ISX... of Natural History Romance "(Fred- 

erick Warne & Co.) is Mr. Edward 
Step's " Shell Life," an introduction to the British 
MoUusca. The author is a well-known leader 
among the many natural history field-clubs of En- 
gland, and his book is planned to meet the needs 
of the unscientific lover of nature. The greater 
part of the Mollusca indigenous in the British Isles 
and adjacent seas are briefly described in this little 
volume, whose utility is greatly enhanced by over 
six hundred excellent illustrations. The work is 
not intended to be a shell-collector's manual, but 
rather to encourage a study of the living animals. 
Their structure, habits, mode of life, enemies, their 
many modifications for protection, and the adap- 
tations to their surroundings, are brought into 
greater prominence than is usual in works of this 
class. Well planned and well executed, it is 
a model popular guide. In accordance with the 
custom fostered in these societies of natural-history 
amateurs, our author uses common names for the 
shells. In a popular work this may be commend- 
able ; but it may become quite as pedantic and 
disagreeable as the binomial nomenclature of science. 
Contrast the "Pod Razor" with Solen viliqua! 
Euphony and precision, if not also usage, sanction 
the latter, while the former has only the vernacular 
to commend it. A recent writer has well said : 
"Scientific names are no harder than others, simply 
less familiar, and when domesticated they cease to 
be hard." 

Mr. Charles Townsend Copeland's 
Irftf^A. lif« «f Edwin Booth, traces the ca- 
reer of the great tragedian in a 
manner characteristic of the " Beacon Biographies " 
— in which series it appears. The author has 
quoted freely from previous records, and has also 
added to his own opinions extracts from contem- 
porary authors. A number of hitherto unpub- 
lished letters, written by Booth to Mr. Thomas 
Bailey Aldrich, reveal incidents and minor touches 
of an eventful life. A rare photograph, which 
Booth considered his best likeness, is reproduced 
as frontispiece — 

"It was thus 
He looked ; such pallor touched his cheek ; 
With that same grace he greeted us — 
Nay, 'tis the man, could it hut speak ! " 

Mr. Copeland's book is one to be read attentively 
by those who take an intellectual interest in stage

history ; owing to its conciseness, it recalls a very 
scarce volume (published in 1846) called "The 
Actor," a biographical sketch of the elder Booth. 

It is not with great expectations of 
either pleasure or profit that one 
takes up a book which on its face 
shows that it has been written by a man who is 
possessed by one idea, especially if the idea is a 
small one and the book is published by the author. 
Such a book is " The Assassination of President 
Lincoln," written and published by Mr. Osborn H. 
Oldroyd, of "Washington, D. C. But the experi- 
ence of the writer has been like that of him of old 
who came to scoff and remained to pray. He is 
glad to acknowledge that he has read the book with 
interest, and with the profit that comes from the 
study of abnormal character as it may affect a 
nation's history. The author has carefully worked 
out every detail in the lives of the conspirators 
during the days that preceded the assassination, 
and their pursuit, trial, and execution ; and the 
book deserves a place on the shelves that hold the 
materials for the history of the Civil War. There 
are eighty-two illustrations. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



" Philippine Affairs : A Retrospect and Outlook," is 
the title of the book which contains President Jacob 
Gould Schurman's recent Boston address, now put 
forth in convenient shape by the Messrs. Scribner. It 
is a publication which deserves the attention of all 
thoughtful Americans. President Schurman is not 
exactly an anti-imperialist yet, but we have hopes of 
his complete conversion in time, for it has been evident 
all along that his conscience was troubling him, and 
that he has found it hard to approve of the administra- 
tion policy of the past three years. We particularly 
call attention to these closing words : " Any decent kind 
of government of Filipinos by Filipinos is better than 
the best possible government of Filipinos by Americans." 
If this principle of action be once accepted, everything 
else that can fairly be urged in behalf of our national 
honor and ideals will follow as a logical consequence. 

The name of John Amos Komensky, under its Latin- 
ized form Comenius, is well known to students of the 
educational art. That he was a philosopher whose 
speculations embraced a far wider field than that of 
education is a fact not so widely known. His " Laby- 
rinth of the World," for example, although a work of 
his youth, is one of the classics of Bohemian literature, 
and presents a wonderful picture of the life and thought 
of the early seventeenth century. This famous work, 
which is of the class that includes the " Utopia " and 
the " Civitas Solis," is also an allegory that has certain 
affinities with the " Pilgrim's Progress." It is differ- 
ent, because Komensky was a scholar of wide range, 
whereas Bunyan was a man of comparatively untutored 
mind and narrow outlook. Count Liitzon, in making 
an English translation of this work, has done a real 
service to comparative literature, and made accessible 
a really important document in the history of modern 
thought. (Button.)

Notes. 



A new edition of Mr. Richard Le Gallienne's para- 
phrase of Omar, with fifty quatrains in addition to 
those before published, is sent us by Mr. John Lane in 
a tastefully-printed volume. ^ -ijn^ '■^'"^^'^ '-t*! 

A new edition, with illustrations, of Mr. Reuben 
Gold Thwaites's " Down Historic Waterways," which 
has been out of print for several years, will be published 
shortly by Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. 

A " Handbook of the Trees of New England," by 
Messrs. Lorin R. Dame and Henry Brooks, is pub- 
lished by Messrs. Ginn & Co. It gives botanical de- 
scriptions of the arboreal species of the New England 
States, and has nearly a hundred full-page plates by 
way of illustrations. 

Three German texts just published by Messrs. D. C. 
Heath & Co. are Lessing's " Minna von Barnhelm," ed- 
ited by Dr. Sylvester Primer ; Korner's " Zriny," 
edited by Dr .Franklin J. Holzworth ; and Herr Heyse's 
story of " Niels mit der Offenen Hand," edited by 
Professor Edward S. Joynes. 

An interesting exhibition of choice first editions and 
books in fine and unique bindings was held by Messrs. 
Charles Scribner's Sons at the Auditorium, Chicago, 
from February 21 to 27. The work of nearly all of 
the leading American, English, and foreign binders 
was represented in the exhibit. 

The Open Court Publishing Co. send us a volume of 
translations from Leibniz, made by Dr. George R. 
Montgomery. The contents include the " Discourse 
on Metaphysics," the " Monadology," and the corre- 
spondence with Arnauld. M. Paul Janet writes a 
philosophical introduction to the volume. 

An excellent translation of M. Charles Wagner's 
" The Simple Life " is published by Messrs. McClure, 
Phillips & Co. Miss Mary Louise Hendee is the trans- 
lator, and an introduction and biographical sketch of 
the author are supplied by Miss Grace King. The 
book itself is one that deserves the widest reading. 

Two lectures on Newman, constituting an appre- 
ciation of that great theologian and still greater writer, 
are comprised in a volume by Dr. Alexander Whyte, 
published by Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. Some 
choice selected passages from Newman's writings are 
added to the lectures, and make up nearly one-half of 
the volume. 

Mr. Nathan Haskell Dole is engaged in revising and 
enlarging his bibliography of Omar Khayydm for a 
new edition of the " Multivariorum " edition of the 
"Rubdiydt," to be published this Spring by Messrs. 
L. C. Page & Co. Mr. Dole, whose address is Jamaica 
Plain, Mass., will be grateful for any information re- 
garding new material for this work. 

A novel of unusual interest soon to be issued by 
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. is Miss Ottilie A, 
Liljencrantz' " The Thrall of Lief the Lucky," a story 
of Viking days. The book will be elaborately illus- 
trated in colors from paintings by Troy and Margaret 
Kinney. Messrs. McClurg have also in press a new 
edition (the thirteenth) of Mr. James Baldwin's " The 
Book Lover," beautifully printed at the Merrymount 
Press. 

A new series of publications issued by the University 
of Chicago Press is entitled *« Contributions to Educa- 
tion," and the numbers are octavo pamphlets of mod- 
erate size. Three have now been published, and three 



others are announced. The numbers now on our table 
are "Isolation in the School," by Mrs. Ella Flagg 
Young ; " Psychology and Social Practice," by Profes- 
sor John Dewey; and "The Educational Situation," 
also by Professor Dewey. They are educational read- 
ing of the most stimulating quality, and deserve to be 
widely circulated. ^f.'^,. ■ -yjtit 

" Thoughts from the Letters of Petrarch," selected 
and edited by Mr. J. Lohse, is issued by Messrs. E. P. 
Dutton & Co. in connection with Messrs. J. M. Dent & 
Co. of London. The reader of this daintily-printed 
book will agree with its editor that " those who only 
know Petrarch by his Sonnets, cannot fully understand 
his true genius, his pure and liberal mind, his great 
erudition, and the power and authority he had over his 
fellow-men." 

Among the books of fiction to be issued by Messrs. 
Little, Brown, & Co. this Spring are the following : 
" The Heroine of the Strait," a romance of Detroit in 
the time of Pontiac, by Miss Mary Catherine Crowley ; 
" The God of Things," a modern society novel, by Miss 
Florence Brooks Whitehouse ; " The Eagle's Talon," 
a romance of the Louisiana Purchase, by Miss Shep- 
pard Stevens ; and " In the Country God Forgot," a 
tale of the Southwest, by Miss Frances Charles. 

A little volume of child verse by Charles Lamb en- 
titled " The King and Queen of Hearts," hitherto un- 
authenticated, will be published this Spring by Messrs. 
McClure, Phillips & Co., in a facsimile reprint of the 
original edition, with an introduction by Mr. E. V. 
Lucas. Noteworthy among other forthcoming publica- 
tions of the same firm are a volume of " Unpublished! 
Letters of Daniel Webster," and Signor Guglielmo- 
Marconi's own account of " Wireless Telegraphy." 

Mr. Elliot Stock, of London, is publishing a series of 
volumes entitled " The Church's Outlook for the 
Twentieth Century." A recent volume in this series 
is by Mr. Arthur Galton, and is entitled " Our Atti- 
tude toward English Roman Catholics and the Papal 
Court." The " Church," it need hardly be added, is 
the Anglican communion, and Mr. Galton, having been 
a Romanist in his earlier years, writes from an intimate 
acquaintance of the two organizations which he now 
compares.

By (Mrs.) MARION TODD

" I pronounce the romance entitled ' Claudia ' one 
of the few great works of fiction ever produced. It is 
intensely interesting and unusual. The correspondence 
between Phillip and Claudia is deeply impressive. Like 
the sparkle of jewels, wisdom glints from its pages."

The English Exploration of America 

We are living in a new period of expansion and great changes on 
the map of the world, such as there has not been since the sixteenth 
and seventeenth centuries. It is interesting at such a time to look 
back to the period when our forefathers expanded into this New 
World. The following Old South Leaflets have been added to the series : 

"John Cabot's Discovery of North America," "Sir Francis Drake 
on the California Coast," "Frobisher's First Voyage," "Sir Humph- 
rey Gilbert's Expedition to Newfoundland," " Raleigh's First Roa- 
noke Colony," "Gosnold's Settlement at Cuttyhunk," "Captain John 
Smith's Description of New England," and "Richard Hakluyt's Dis- 
course on Western Planting." 

These leaflets are Nos. 115-122 in the Old South series, which is 
now so large. They are made up from original documents of the 
period, and are all accompanied by careful historical and bibliograph- 
ical notes. Sold for five cents a copy, they place at the service of the 
schools and the public a most important mass of historical papers not 
otherwise easily accessible.

Six Books that are Moving 



PRINCE HENRY OF PRUSSIA, when calling recently at the American 
Embassy at Berlin, to obtain from Mr. Andrew White information 
concerning the best literature on American Life and Customs, was recom- 
mended to read Bryce's famous Handbook, and James F. Muirhead's 

America: the Land of Contrasts 

BEING A BRITON'S VIEW OF HIS AMERICAN KIN. 

New Edition. 12mo, $1.20 net. 

The author is well fitted to write on American Life and Customs, being a much " travelled " man, whose 
wife is a member of a well-known Boston family. Indeed, his book is gallantly dedicated " To the Land 
that has Given me what makes Life most worth Living." 



JUST PUBLISHED. 

The Story of Eden 

By DOLPH WYLLARDE. 

12mo, $1.50. 

A vivid book, compelling from cover to cover. 

The scene is laid in the tropical suburbs of Cape 

Town, South Africa. Its plot is a thrilling society 

love-story. Its time is before the Boer war. 



JUST PUBLISHED. 

The Decoy 

By FRANCIS DANA. 
12mo, $1.50. 

Mr. Dana's new book tells of the demoniacal 
machinatirns of a quack-spiritualist, who exerts his 
pernicious influence upon a country girl almost up 
to the point of ruin to her. Incidentally he gives an 
excellent description of New England, its scenery 
and its native humanity. 



FIFTH THOUSAND. 

The Usurper 

By W. J. LOCKE. 

Author of" The White Dove," " Derelicts," 
"'Idols." etc. 
12mo, $1.50. 
An arresting book, depicting the life and ex- 
periences of a man, who, though of noble character, 
voluntarily usurps the riches of another. The de- 
nouement is powerful and dramatic; the romance is 
attractively painted; the characters firmly drawn. 



T WENTY- THIRD THO USA ND. 

The Aristocrats 

^Y GERTRUDE ATHERTON. 
12mo, $1.50. 

No comment is needed on the work of one of the 
foremost writers of this country to-day. Those who 
have not yet read " The Aristocrats " have missed 
one of the cleverest " national " books ever written. 
It should be on the shelf of every public and private 
library in America. 



Casting of Nets 



By RICHARD BAGOT. I2mo, $1.50. 

The publisher wishes to correct an erroneous impression which seems to be gaining 
credence with regard to this book. It is not written in condemnation of Roman Cath- 
olicism; on the contrary, the author is himself a Roman Catholic, who has spent 
much of his life in Rome, and who is therefore thoroughly conversant with Roman 
influence. His purpose is to expose, as, indeed, did Dante himself, the fallacious 
theory of the temporal supremacy of the Vicar of Christ. The Pope, he argues, 
weakens the power of his spiritual heritage by grasping at a worldly power he was 
never intended to wield. 
Rabbi Krauskopf : " The story is excellently written ; it holds the reader spell-bound from first to 

last. It is a strongly purposive book. The author deals with facts, the names are but guises of actual 

personages well known in aristocratic circles in England and in Rome."

IN 



The VALLEY of DECISION 



Recognized everywhere upon publica- 
tion as an extraordinary performance. 



HAMILTON W. MABIE says in the 
N. Y. Times Saturday Review : 

"It is individual and" original to a high de- 
gree. ... 

"It is rare and fine and full of distinction. . 

"A novel of notable charm and ability. . . 

" Full of nice shadings, of delicate distinc- 
tions, of those side lights, skilfully shifted, 
which bring out the different aspects of a rich 
and varied experience. . . . 

"A study of temperament of a very artistic 
kind, admirable in its poise. . . . 

"A delight as a piece of exquisite handi- 
craft. ' ' 



THE NEW YORK MAIL AND 
EXPRESS greeted it: 

" Demonstrates once for all that she is 
a great novelist as well as an exquisite 
artist . . . the American artist v^hom we 
can place unhesitatingly beside Mrs. Hum- 
phry Ward at her fullest and best," 



Her first long no vely long awaited 
with great interest, has thus more 
than satisfied all expectations. 



JEANETTE L. QILDER says 

in the 

Chicago Tribune : 

"It fulfills the promise held out by Mrs. 
Wharton's earlier work. . . . 

" It will give the author a high place among 
her fellow craftsmen. . . . 

"It will do much to take the taste of some 
recent fiction out of the reader's mouth." 



The NEW YORK EVENING SUN says : 

" 'T'HOSE who predicted great things of Mrs. Wharton here find plenty of evidence that they prophesied 
* because they knew. . . . Even in those respects in which she has not quite hit it off, her failure is a 
finer thing than other people's successes." 



"A REBUKE to the clap-trap hurriedly written fiction of the hour," says 
^*- itself as a true novel, one of splendid parts and lasting qualities."

THE THRALL OF LEIP THE LUCKY 

A STORY OF VIKING DAYS 

By Ottilie A. Liljencrantz 

With 6 full-page illustrations in color, and other embellishments, by Troy and Marj?aret Kinney. 12mo. $1.50. 

SELDOM has a new work by a new author been offered to the public with such 
confidence in its immediate success. But this wonderful story of Leif Ericssen's 
voyage, with every page permeated with the romance and fascination of the Viking 
days, is so fresh and inspired, and carries the reader so irresistibly into the wild free 
life of the Norsemen, that it is difficult to imagine how any one can withstand its 
charm. The hero is a young Englishman of noble birth, who has been captured 
by the Vikings, and is sold to Leif Ericsson as a thrall. The story concerns his ad- 
ventures among Leif's band of sea-rovers, and also his very stormy wooing of the 
beautiful Helga, a most fascinating heroine. Alwin is the name of the young thrall, 
and he is brave, spirited, and wilful under his restraint. This intolerance brings the 
gravest consequences, and more than once his reckless defiance of his masters all but 
ends his career. The characters, the background, and the atmosphere of the story 
are so unusual and new in the world of fiction that The Thrall of Leif the Lucky 
will be most welcome to the novel reader who longs for "something different." 

THE POINT OF HONOUR 
By H. A. HiNKsoN 

Author of " The King's Deputy." With a striking cover design by F. Berkeley Smith. 12mo. 81.50. 

NO BETTER idea can be given of the dashing Irish gentlemen in Mr. Hinkson's 
book than the author's Foreword: "These men once lived and had strenuous 
lives. The blood that was in them was generous as the wine that enriched it. They 
feared neither the buttered claret at night, nor the blaze of the pistol in the morn- 
ing, and their honour was as untarnished as the bright steel of their sword-blades. 
The saddle was their cradle, pointblankers were their playthings. Some of them 
loved women; near all of them would have fought for a woman, with or without 
cause." This single paragraph is indicative of the spirit with which the entire book 
is carried along, and the best possible assurance that there are no dull lines. Every 
one will be captivated by these roystering blades who regarded an early morning 
meeting with "pistols for two and coffee for four" as a trivial incident in their 
daily life. 

ALABAMA SKETCHES 
By Samuel Minturn Peck 

Author of "Cap and Bells," "The Golf Girl," etc. ]6mo. $1.00. 

DR. PECK is well known as the author of several sprightly books of verse 
and other artistic trifles. He is a native of Alabama and understands how to 
describe the local characteristics of his own people in the most entertaining manner. 
This is the fourth volume in A. 0. McClurg & Co.'s series of " Southern Sketches."

THE PRINCE INCOGNITO 

By Elizabeth Wormeley Latimer 

Author of " The Last Years of the Nineteenth Century," etc. With cover design by F. Berkeley Smith. 12mo. $1.50. 

MRS. LATIMER'S literary experience would seem the best possible preparation 
for the production of a historical novel, and it may be safely predicted that 
her admirers will not be disappointed in The Prince Incognito. Her hero is Ri- 
naldo D'Este, cousin to Louis XV., who attempts to give up his rank and title 
for the Huguenot maiden he loves. The French laws are very severe against the 
marriage of Huguenots and Catholics, and the Prince and his young wife are com- 
pelled to escape to the New World. Their adventures and trials, which are many 
and varied, are described in a style that is full of color and imagination. 

GERTRUDE DORRANCE 
By Mary Fisher 

Author of "A Group of French Critics," etc 12mo. $1.50. 

IN Gertrude Dorrance Miss Fisher offers her first novel, and the same discrimina- 
tion and excellent taste that govern her writing elsewhere is exhibited in this 
thoroughly modern story. Gertrude is a most engaging young person who has 
everything against her, but manages to come out very well in spite of it. She is a 
proud, clever girl, with a remarkable talent for the violin, and an exceptional en- 
dowment of good looks. Three men fall in love with her — the young Scotcli Doctor, 
the philanthropic Robert Aird, and finally Jack Holmes, who is just the sort of 
man that a spirited girl like Gertrude would care for. Besides the love story, 
the book is interesting on account of its many graphic descriptions of city life. 

A SELECTION OF THE WORLD'S BEST SHORT STORIES 
By Shervvin Cody 

Author of " The Art of Short Story Writing." Printed on thin "Bible" paper, flexible binding. 18mo. $1.00 net. 

A GENERAL introduction and successive introductions to the various separate 
stories in this volume give a short but comprehensive history of the art of short 
story writing, from the Decameron and the Arabian Knights to Barrie and Kipling. 
Mr. Cody's earlier book on "The Art of Short Story Writing" has been declared bv 
Mr. Zangwill to be the best treatise on the short story that has appeared. The list 
of stories includes: Patient Griselda; Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp; Rip Van 
Winkle; A Passion in the Desert; A Christmas Carol; The Gold Bug; The Great 
Stone Face ; The Necklace ; The Man Who Would be King ; and others. 

LETTERS TO AN ENTHUSIAST 
By Mary Cowden Clarke 

With 10 photogravure plates. Printed on English featherweight paper. Tall 8vo. Boards, paper label. $2.50 net. 

THIS might be called a chapter in the life of the great Shakespearean scholar, 
being a collection of her letters addressed to Mr. Robert Balmanno of New York, 
whom she named "the Enthusiast." The correspondence began after the pub- 
lication of her famous "Concordance," and lasted from 1850 to 1861. The letters 
are personal in tone, and as Mrs. Clarke was intimately acquainted with the leaders 
of social and literary circles in London, they abound in interesting references to 
Hazlitt, Keats, Douglas Jerrold, Lamb, Leigh Hunt, Dickens, and Millais. The 
style is delightfully sprightly and vivacious, and pervaded by the literary atmosphere 
in which Mrs. Clarke lived. Every effort has been made to make the illustrations, 
typography, and binding consistent with the literary interest of the work.

A GUIDE TO THE BEST READING 

By James Baldwin, Ph. D. 

Author of "Choice English Lyrics," "The Story of Roland," "The Story of Siegfried," etc. 
re-written, and printed from new plates at the Merrymount Press. 18mo. $1.00 net. 



A new edition. 



THE unique position and permanent value of Professor Baldwin's Book Lover 
among books of literary reference has led to an urgent demand for a new edition 
brought down to date, as it has never been succeeded by an equally useful book of 
the same kind. For this new edition the text has been entirely re-written, and 
brought down to the present time, and many new lists have been added. The me- 
chanical details have been intrusted to Mr. D. B. Updike of the Merrymount Press, 
who has achieved an enviable reputation in the last few years for fine printing. A 
new font of type, decidedly literary in appearance, has been used ; the binding is 
appropriate and dignified; and the entire appearance of the volume will be most 
attractive to the lover of a beautiful book. In its previous form twelve editions 
were sold of this work. 

RIGHT READING 

QUOTATIONS FROM TEN FAMOUS AUTHORS ON THE CHOICE AND USE OF BOOKS 

Flexible binding. 24mo. 80 cts. net. 

THIS practically useful little volume, in its convenient size, careful printing, and 
generally dainty appearance, is also a fine specimen of the work of the Merry- 
mount Press. The book itself consists of a collection of "words of good counsel 
on the choice and right use of books," taken from the writings of ten famous 
modern authors, ranging from Schopenhauer to Frederic Harrison. The selec- 
tions, representing the opinions of the wisest of our modern authors on a subject 
of vital interest and importance to every one, are especially apropos in this day of 
many books and indiscriminate reading. 

HELPFUL THOUGHTS 

NEW SELECTIONS FROM MARCUS AURELIUS 

By Walter Lee Brown 

Companion volume to "Right Reading." Flexible binding, aimo. 80 cts. nc<. 

THIS new selection from the Meditation, in appearance and size is exactly simi- 
lar to the book just mentioned, having been printed at the Merrymount Press 
from a special font of type to be found nowhere else. The selections have been 
admirably chosen, and as the title indicates, they are made with a view of providing 
a philosophy of some real value to the reader. Mr. Brown is one of the best known 
collectors of Aurelius in the country, and hig selection has been made with the 
greatest care and discrimination.

MR. PAYXE is known everywhere as a notably fair-minded writer on literary 
and kindred topics. He has a broad knowledge, an excellent discrimination, 
a fine sense of proportion, and a clear, facile style — all qualities which make the

in the past twelve years, and cover a wide range of subjects within the literary field.

OCEAN TO OCEAN 

By J. W. G. Walker, U. S. N. 

With 15 full-page plates and 4 maps. Also the full text of the Clayton-Bulwer and Hay-Pauncefote treaties. 
12mo, indexed. $1.25 net. 

ALTHOUGH Lieutenant Walker is the son of Rear Admiral Walker, the head of 
the Canal Commission, he does not offer any biased opinion on the merits of 
the Nicaragua route. He has contented himself with recording the observations 
made while conducting the Western branch of the survey of 1898 — impressions in 
which the accuracy of the civil engineer is agreeably combined with the entertain- 
ing comment of the leisurely traveler. It is not often that a book which contains 
the latest information on a vital topic of national interest is at the same time so en- 
tirely enjoyable to the reader who is looking for entertainment. The author has 
added a most graphic account of the famous Walker Filibustering Expedition. 

NOTES ON THE NICARAGUA CANAL 
By Henry I. Sheldon 

A new edition, with 22 full-page illustrations and 5 maps. 12mo, indexed. $1.25. 

MR. SHELDON'S book, unlike Lieutenant Walker's, takes a very decided 
position as to the choice of routes. It is, in fact, a strong brief for the Nicar- 
agua canal, written by a thorough business man who has made a careful study of the 
situation, and who states clearly and forcibly the reasons for his choice. All the 
great canal projects of the world are considered in connection with the discussion 
of the present enterprise, and a complete index is also included. The book has 
been a strong factor in the literature of the subject, and a new edition has become 
necessary. It is uniform in style with Ocean to Ocean^ and each book supplements 
the other admirably. 

DOWN HISTORIC WATERWAYS 
By Reuben Gold Thwaites 

A new edition, with 8 full-page illustrations, and cover design by Frank Hazenplug. 12mo. $1.20 net. 

SEVERAL years ago Mr. Thwaites made a Summer canoe trip over the Wisconsin, 
Fox, and Rock Rivers, and wrote a delightfully interesting account of his ad- 
ventures and observations. It proved to be a very popular book, but it has been out 
of print for some time, and the publishers have now ready a new edition in enlarged 
form, with new illustrations from original photographs, and a striking cover design 
by Mr. Frank Hazenplug. 

NESTLINGS OF FOREST AND MARSH 
By Irene Grosvenor Wheelock 

With 16 full-page photogravures and over 60 illustrations in the text. 12mo. $1.40 net. 

THE interest in the close-range study of our familiar birds is always especially 
active in the Spring, and this excellent little book will be most acceptable to 
many amateurs in the field of nature study. Mrs. Wheelock is herself an amateur, 
although well known for her many intelligent investigations. Her book, as the title 
indicates, is devoted particularly to the young birds and their habits. It is doubt- 
ful whether this period in bird life has ever been treated in a more interesting way, 
and readers are likely to find much that is new and instructive. There are sixteen 
full-page photogravures and over sixty half-tone illustrations in the text.

THE BATTLEGROUND 

By ELLEN GLASGOW 

IN THIS vigorous and delightful story Miss Glasgow has written a more mature 
and stronger novel than even her very successful "The Voice of the People." 
It deals with Virginia home life immediately before and during the Civil War, 
and the dramatic pictures of the bloody struggle are heightened in effect by the 
fascinating background of old-fashioned culture and refinement which existed 
among the ante-bellum gentlefolk. The two girls are as charming types of 
Southern " belles " as have ever been portrayed in fiction, while the book 
sparkles with delightful humor. It is one of the most human and illumin- 
ating pictures of those terrible times that has ever been written. 

Illustrated by W. Granville Smith and W. J. Baee.

The LEOPARD'S Spots 

A Romance of the White Man's Burden 
By THOMAS DIXON, JR. 

T^His NOVEL is as remarkable in its way as 



A THOUSAND COPIES 
of this novel were wired for two 
months before publication by a 
Southern retail dealer ; one jobber 
ordered another thousand; and 
advance orders of 100 and 250 
copies were common from firms 
which usually order from 10 to 25 
copies. Although it is Mr. Dixon's 
first booky the first edition was 
15,000 copies. 



" Uncle Tom's Cabin " was when it first 
appeared. That book gave, in the form of 
fiction, a picture of the Negro's sufferings 
from the Northern point of view. Mr. Dixon's 
book gives the Southern point of view of the 
same question, and as a picture it is as graphic 
and as striking as Mrs. Stowe's book. No 
matter what may be the reader's opinion about 
the race problem, it is certainly right that an 
adequate presentation of the Southern view 
in the form of fiction, which is easy to read 
and which carries conviction by its very sin- 
cerity, should be studied by people who have 
not known the facts.

INTERNATIONAL AMITY. 



NOTES 



216 



A full generation has now pa8.sed since the 
publication of " The Coming Race," by the 
versatile novelist who had given us books as 
various as " Pelham," " A Strange Story," 
"Harold," "The Caxtons," and " Ken elm 
Chillingly." This forecast was impressive in 
many ways, but in no way more impressive 
than in its assertion that war would eventually 
be made impossible through improvements in 
the means of destruction. Weapons would 
become so deadly that war would practically 
mean annihilation of the contending forces, and 
the good sense of the nations would prevail in 
the abandonment of this barbaric way of set- 
tling disputes. The past thirty years have 
witnessed, not exactly the literal fulfillment of 
this prediction, but marked progress in the 
direction of its fulfillment, and, as a natural 
consequence of the increased effectiveness of 
fighting instruments, a marked reluctance to 
resort to the arbitrament of war. 

Within much more recent years, a great 
Russian authority upon the art of war, as well 
as a man of the widest experience in practical 
affairs, has argued with convincing logic that 
war is fast becoming a practical impossibility. 
This beneficent result of scientific progress is 
due, not simply, as in Bulwer's argument, be- 
cause of the increasing deadliness of weapons, 
but rather because, with this increasing deadli- 
ness, the advantage to the defense becomes so 
much greater than the advantage to the attack 
that all wars of the ordinary type, in which an 
invading army seeks to conquer a foreign 
country, must henceforth be so hopelessly one- 
sided as to be entirely futile. The position of 
the late M. de Bloch has received ample con- 
firmation during the course of the distressing 
struggles of the last three years, in South 
Africa and the Philippine Islands, and the 
lesson of these conflicts is not likely to be 
missed. Entirely aside from the moral issues 
involved, both of these wars have borne out the 
essential assertion of M. de Bloch that a small 
body of men, armed with the modern means 
of defense, can resist, for an indefinite period, 
an invading body of overwhelmingly superior 
strength. In making this principle clear, it

[March 16, 



may well happen that these wars will prove to 
have been blessings in disguise, and that the 
last turning-point in the centuries may prove 
to have been a real turning-point in the history 
of mankind. 

A glance at the European situation seems 
to us also to offer reassuring signs. A few 
years ago a general conflict of the powers 
seemed inevitable, anil it was doubtful whether 
the century would end without the precipita- 
tion of hostilities. To- day the danger seems 
far less imminent, and it looks as if the great 
international rivalries and jealousies might 
somehow be settled by peaceful means. There 
is the Hague Conference, for example. It is 
customary to speak slightingly of that remark- 
able gathering, but it was nevertheless symp- 
tomatic of the growing strength of cosmopolitan 
opinion. This is a factor in warfare which 
must henceforth be recognized, and, while it 
has not averted the deplorable wars of the last 
few years, it has made those responsible for 
them feel very uncomfortable. We have little 
doubt that the historian of the future will look 
back to the Tsar's eirenicon as to the begin- 
ning of a new era in international relations, 
and that the permanent tribunal which remains 
as the substantial result of the Hague Confer- 
ence will be invoked more than once. 

The growing conviction of the impossibility 
of accomplishing by means of warfare what 
has been easily accomplished by the stronger 
force in past years is already acting as a quiet 
deterrent upon the minds of generals and states- 
men. Cooperating with this influence is the 
other influence which comes from the growth of 
international sympathies and the cementing of 
the bonds of friendship in many obtrusive and 
unobtrusive ways. There is a story afloat that 
Prince Henry of Prussia the other day, in an ex- 
pansive moment, said that he was having the 
time of his life in America, adding that when at 
home they only used him to send to funerals. 
Certainly a better use has been found for him 
than that, when his few days' stay in this country 
has been productive of so much good-will and 
mutual esteem between the two great nations 
concerned in the exchange of courtesies. When 
the surface-character of the visit, its pomp and 
its parade, shall have been forgotten, when the 
tumult and the shouting shall have died away, 
its symbolical character will remain as the one 
memorable thing about it, and will be likely to 
influence the relations between Germany and 
America for many years to come. The visit 
will remain a gracious memory long after the 



glitter of the event shall have* grown dim in 
our recollection. 

Another recent event of similar significance 
has been the visit of the Baron d'Estournelles 
de Constant, bearing the greetings of the 
great European Republic to its sister Republic 
in the West. This distinguished statesman, 
journeying from Paris to Chicago for the ex- 
press purpose of paying a Frenchman's tribute 
to the memory of the greatest of Americans, 
has pleaded in eloquent terms for the cause 
of international good will, for the sinking of 
political jealousies and commercial rivalries 
in the larger interests of the common human- 
ity of the race, and wherever he has spoken, 
his noble idealism — which is nevertheless that 
of a practical man of the world — has aroused 
echoes of responsive sympathy in the breasts 
of his hearers. Now the influence which is 
represented by such visits as these, and sup- 
plemented by the many other modern agencies 
which tend to the creation of a mutual un- 
derstanding between our own people and 
those of a foreign country, amounts in the total 
sum to an incalculably great force exerted 
in the interests of civilization and for the 
removal of ancient prejudice. Whenever men 
are brought together on the basis of a common 
interest, whether intellectual or social, the 
racial barriers erst raised between them are at 
once cast down, and are as if they had never 
existed. Every international gathering of men 
of politics, of science, or of literature, offers a 
silent but effective protest against the passions 
which set nations at war with one another. 

We do not expect that the world will be 
swayed by reason alone for many generations 
yet. Nevertheless, the ascendancy of reason is 
by slow degrees making itself felt. In spite 
of all discouragements, " man is being made," 
in Tennyson's phrase, and 

" Prophet-eyes may catch a glory slowly gaining on the 
shade." 

To the logical mind the outcome of the evolu- 
tionary process, however long-delayed, is sure. 
Such a mind must admit that even patriotism 
is selfishness, although at several removes 
from what we commonly call by that name. 
There is the selfishness of the individual, first 
of all, which has no redeeming quality. Then 
there is the selfishness of the family, in which 
the element of altruism first appears. Then 
there is the selfishness of the clan, the nation, 
and the race, and in each of these stages of the 
sentiment the altruistic character becomes 
more and more marked, until the clear thinker 



1902.] 



THE DIAL 



193 



finds it impossible to believe that even race 
should set an absolute barrier to his sympa- 
thies, or that anything less than the whole of 
mankind should be held in his affection. To 
take this final step to a complete altruism is, 
no doubt, to overcome the. " last infirmity of 
noble mind," — no easy task, — yet was it not 
taken by a Roman freedman over two thousand 
years ago, and did not the audience in the 
Koman theatre greet with thunders of applause 
the famous line which declared that no man 
may remain unconcerned by aught that touches 
ithe interests of humanity at large ? 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 



WHO READS THE GOOD OLD BOOKS? 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

A recent article in " The Atlantic " gives a just and 
•appreciative tribute to the poet George Crabbe, which 
'I am sure will do something toward the revival of his 
poetry, if it is in need of reviving. The writer in " The 
Atlantic " wonders why Crabbe is not now read. Per- 
mit me to answer that he is read. Let no one draw the 
inference that because standard books are not adver- 
tised and bruited in the critical and personal columns 
of newspapers and magazines, therefore they are not 
read. They do not need such exploitation; they have 
passed that unhappy experimental stage, and have come 
£nally to their own. They rest from the dread ordeal 
which a novel venture must undergo. The crowd goes 
to see a new invention put in operation; when it is a 
■success, they stay at home and reap and enjoy the 
benefits of it. 

Crabbe, and many other good old authors like him, 
are still read by those to whom newspaper advertising 
and uncritical puffery of books have become a nuisance 
and a stench in the nostrils. It seems as though the 
last degradation of literature had arrived when quantity 
rather than quality is the criterion. But let us take 
courage; it is only noise, bluster, superlatives, large 
type, and monotonous adjectives that make us feel for 
the moment that all discrimination is submerged, all 
real distinction no longer possible. Far away in more 
quiet seats, the wise and sincere lovers of good litera- 
ture are still reading good books, the good old ones, 
^and sometimes the good new ones which are equals of 
the old and by some miracle creep in between the 
pushing and blatant hundred-thousand editions of phe- 
nomenal and soon-to-be-forgotten works. 

What, in general, is a new book ? It is one you do 
not care to read again, — only another, newer one. 
Such books are printed to sell; they do not endure, 
and never do they depose the old. They may be kept 
on the surface of a shallow and rapid stream, but sink 
when they come to deeper and wider waters, waters 
navigated by experienced pilots sailing by the sun and 
stars. All the while these monstrous editions of pop- 
ular books are being printed, there goes on the quiet 
isale and reading of those to which the seal of time and 
fame has been set, and from which the accidents of 
chance have been eliminated. The fact that certain 
writers are relegated to the rear in catalogues, and are 



no more mentioned by reviewers, is no index to their 
real place in literature or to their permanent sale. 

A recent critic, in a publication devoted incidentally 
to the review of books and chiefly to miscellaneous lit- 
erary news and gossip, had the temerity to state, in 
effect, that there was no longer any sale for Emerson's 
writings. He had his ready figures, — for these critics 
are mathematical in their distribution of honors to 
authors, and settle their position by the formula, " How 
many copies does he sell in a week? " They forget to 
inquire in regard to the steadiness of the demand, or 
the class of readers, — which latter point is the most 
important of all for any just estimate of the ultimate 
fate of a book. 

As for Crabbe, I repeat that he is read. I am a 
very obscure person, living in one of the most remote 
corners of New England; yet I still read Crabbe with 
admiration, and I know of others who do. I cannot 
believe that we are exceptional; nor can I doubt that 
among those of larger opportunities, and with an am- 
bition to know the best in English literature, there 
must still be numerous readers of Crabbe's " Tales." 
But whether there are or not, makes no difference to 
us. We stand up boldly, and are not ashamed to de- 
clare that we read and admire these works, and that 
they ought to be read and admired. If we need an 
ally and defender, there is Edward FitzGerald, a man 
whose instincts were infallible in poetry. 

I was very glad to see that the writer in '« The 
Atlantic " laid much emphasis upon the " atmosphere " 
of the " Tales." This is true insight. To be sure, 
"atmosphere " is rather a large and a vague word; but 
there is none nearer the thing meant, and after reading 
Crabbe one may feel the force of the term and need not 
try to analyze it. Let him enjoy it, and give the poet 
his due measure of praise. This ** atmosphere " is, I 
believe, the distinguishing characteristic which Crabbe 
would claim for his work; for, contrasting his own 
style — in the preface to the second series of " Tales " 
— with that of Pope, he says that the poems of Pope are 
without " atmosphere." 

The style of Crabbe is simple enough; it has no 
conceits and little embroidery; the plots are rather 
bare and loose-jointed. When he paints " men, man- 
ners, and things," which he says is his chief aim, his 
pen is truly his own, and inimitable. This is why I 
believe he is still read, — such is my faith in the liv- 
ing strength and continuance of the attraction which 
real literature possesses. John Albee.

PROFESSOR MiJNSTERBERG'S BOOK ON AMERICA. 
( To the Editor of The Dial.) 
Many Americans, not conspicuously lacking in loy- 
alty to their land and its institutions, will deeply regret 
Dr. Wergeland's censure, in The Dial for Feb. 16, of 
Professor Miinsterberg's " American Traits from the 
Point of View of a German." Sincere students of in- 
ternational relations have for years yearned to see such 
a candid expression concerning America, after all the 
prejudices, caricatures, and traditional misrepresenta- 
tions upon which the Germans are everlastingly harp- 
ing. Here is a foreign scholar with eyes and a heart, 
fair-minded, sound, and modern, who actually tells the 
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. He 
shows how ignorance has led to mutual antipathy where 
there should be sympathy between Americans and Ger- 
mans; as he significantly puts it, " they do not like each

other, because they do not regard each other as gentle- 
men." Professor MUnsterberg is the first man, as far 
as I know (with the possible exception of Herman 
Grimm), to show that the typical American is an ideal- 
ist through and through, and not essentially greedy 
and vulgar, brutal and corrupt. Quite as helpful are 
the little-understood truths which he tells us about his 
own people (of unusual interest being his comparison 
between the Emperor William and Theodore Roose- 
velt), and even more valuable are his open, friendly, 
and impartial suggestions about some features of our 
own civilization. 

Is it true that America prefers to work out its diffi- 
cult problems " with little aid from foreigners " ? In 
my opinion, such aid is most welcome, when tendered in 
a wise and humane spirit. James Taft Hatfield.

THE DICTIONARY MADE FOR MAN. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

Anent some recent discussion in your columns of the 
permissibility of " proven " as past participle of " prove," 
and of similar discussions regarding " correct usage," I 
beg to call attention to a recent address of Professor 
E. S. Sheldon as President of the American Modern 
Language Association, entitled " Practical Philology." 
As one of the chief workers on the last edition of the 
International Dictionary he might be expected to favor 
the doctrine of the infallibility of the dictionary. But 
observe how he regards the matter: 

" Among the misconceptions which embarrass us, espe- 
cially at the outset, in our teaching is the narrow view often 
taken of the relation of grammar to language and of the dic- 
tionary to language. People are accustomed to look upon 
grammar as containing the rules to which they must conform 
in the use of language, and they are only too apt to think 
that the larger English dictionaries contain all the words that 
anybody has the right to use in speaking or writing English, 
and that any word in the dictionary may be so used. We 
should hardly need to explain that we look upon grammar 
simply as the description of the structure of a language, of its 
condition during some definite period of its constantly chang- 
ing history, and that to us a dictionary is a more or less in- 
complete list of the words and phrases used in a language in 
some period of its life, with definitions, often inexact, of these 
words and phrases." 
And further: 

" We must accept the principle that in the use of lan- 
guage, whether it be a question of syntax that arises, or one 
about the proper pronunciation of a word, good usage is de- 
cisive. The philologist can perhaps tell what would be the 
regular pronunciation if phonetic laws were observed without 
any interference of disturbing influences, but it does not fol- 
low that the regular pronunciation is really the correct one." 
And the same attitude is correct regarding the forms 
of the verb " prove," or any other matter of language. 
By various processes, such as analogy and euphony, 
strong verbs have become weak and weak verbs have 
become strong. If " prove " shows a tendency to de- 
velop a strong past participle after the analogy of 
" woven," there is no more reason for virtuous indigna- 
tion and protest than when the orange develops a seed- 
less " sport," or when the neglected apple reverts to its 
thorny kind. All are processes of nature. The dic- 
tionary was made for man, and not man for the diction- 
ary. However, in an imperfect and belated way, the 
grammar and the dictionary attempt to tell the rank 

a,nd file of us what srood usage is. „^ ,, ^

Memoirs of ax Observant Woman.* 



King George the Second was one day prom- 
enading in state on the Broad Walk at Ken- 
sington with the Royal Family, when a little 
girl who, with her French governess, had come 
to view the spectacle, broke away from the 
astonished " mamselle " and danced up to his 
Britannic Majesty with the laughing salute, — 
" Comment vous portez-vous. Monsieur le Roi? 
Vous avez une grande et belle maison ici, 
n'est-ce pas ?" Old King George was delighted 
with this naivete^ and desired the little maid to 
be brought often to see him. At these visits 
she frequently found her royal host either en- 
gaged with one of the court ladies or busy 
counting out his money, which he used to 
receive regularly every Monday morning ; but 
he was always glad to break off and have a 
romp with his little friend. On one of these 
occasions he suddenly snatched the child up 
and popped her into a great china jar that 
stood in the room, shutting down the cover on 
her to prove her courage. But the little pris- 
oner immediately began in a merry voice to 
sing the French song, " Malbruc," which so 
delighted her jailor that he straightway re- 
leased her. 

This lively and interesting child was Lady 
Sarah Lennox, fourth daughter of Charles, 
second Duke of Richmond, and Lady Sarah 
Cadogan. She was born in 1745, and was 
about five years old when she thus captivated 
her sovereign by her innocent charms. Fifteen 
years later the young Prince of Wales was 
smitten with her beauty and winsome ways, 
and soon after his accession made overtures of 
matrimony to her, which after some hesitation 
she accepted. But objections to the marriage 
were raised in various quarters, and the claims 
of Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg were 
pressed upon the youthful ruler until he 
yielded and renounced the lady of his choice. 
She was touched rather with scorn at her 
lover's duplicity and inconstancy than with 
grief at his loss ; and as her thoughts were 
just then preoccupied with the death of a pet 
squirrel, the whole affair moved her but little.

frailty — is its keynote, and fittingly enough, 
for she was the offspring of a romantic mar- 
riage. Its singular details are worth record- 
ing here. Charles, Duke of Richmond, one of 
the Lords of the Bedchamber to King George 
II., had been, as was not unusual in those days, 
married while yet a mere boy to a young lady 
not of his own choice. His girl bride was 
Lady Sarah, daughter of that Earl Cadogan 
who distinguished himself as a cavalry officer 
in the Duke of Marlborough's wars. This 
match was made to cancel a gambling debt, 
the young people's consent being the last thing 
thought of. The bridegroom, then Earl of 
March, was summoned from school, and the 
bride brought from her nursery ; a clergyman 
was in attendance, and the children were told 
that they were immediately to be made man 
and wife. The young lady offered no com- 
ment, but the lad exclaimed, " They surely 
are not going to marry me to that dowdy ! " 
Married, however, he was, after which a post- 
chaise was called, and the young husband was 
packed off with his tutor to make the " grand 
tour," while his bride was sent back to her 
mother. After some years abroad Lord March 
returned, a well educated, handsome young 
man, with no very agreeable recollections of 
his child wife. Thus it was that, instead of 
hastening to her embraces, he made his way to 
the opera, where he amused himself between 
the acts in examining the assembled company. 
He had not long been thus occupied when a 
very young and beautiful woman caught his 
attention, and he turned to a gentleman beside 
him and inquired her name. "You must be 
a stranger in London," was the reply, " not to 
know the toast of the town, the beautiful Lady 
March." Most agreeably surprised, the er- 
rant husband hastened to the lady's box and 
claimed her as his bride, — the very " dowdy " 
from whom he had scornfully turned away at 
their first meeting, but with whom he after- 
ward lived so happily that she died of a broken 
heart within a twelvemonth of his decease in 
1750. 

To return to the subject of this sketch. Lady 
Sarah appeared as chief bridesmaid at the 
marriage of the king who had so ardently 
courted and so coolly rejected her, and she had 
the satisfaction of noting that even then he 
had eyes only for her. A few months later 
she herself was married, at the age of seven- 
teen, to the eldest son of Sir William Bun- 
bury. She continued to have many admirers 
after her marriage, and for one of them, her 



cousin, Lord William Gordon, she appears to 
have entertained a warmer regard than con- 
sisted with her duty as a wife. A separation 
followed, and then a divorce ; but after that 
the injured husband paid her occasional visits 
and even wished to remarry her. In 1781 
Lady Sarah married the Hon. George Napier, 
who had lost his first wife two years before. 
He had served through the American war, and 
he afterward held high military office. By 
her second husband Lady Sarah became the 
mother of three daughters and five sons, in- 
cluding Charles, George, and William, who 
adopted their father's profession, rose high in 
the service, and all three took part in the Pen- 
insular War, of which Sir William has left his 
well-known history. Charles was the con- 
queror of Scinde, and each of the three broth- 
ers was eventually knighted for distinguished 
services to his country. To her large family 
Lady Sarah appears to have been an exem- 
plary mother, carefully providing for the edu- 
cation of her boys out of a very modest income, 
and in every way showing herself worthy of 
tke high honor that her famous sons afterward 
brought her. Her husband's death in 1804 
made her task the more difficult, until the 
king, her sometime lover, granted her a gen- 
erous pension in recognition of Colonel Napier's 
services. She passed her declining years in 
London, where she died, surrounded by her 
children, at the age of eighty-one. 

Such, in outline, is the life which the Coun- 
tess Ilchester and her son. Lord Stavordale, 
have presented for our edification and amuse- 
ment. Two contemporary memoirs, by the 
first Lord Holland and by Mr. Henry Napier, 
son of Lady Sarah, are here published for the 
first time in full ; and they are followed by a 
generous selection from Lady Sarah's letters, 
and prefaced by a biographical introduction. 
Numerous portraits, many of them by Sir 
Joshua Reynolds, are handsomely reproduced 
for the adornment of the volumes. A short 
extract from the letters, which, by the way, are 
most carefully edited with abundant explana- 
tory footnotes, appendices, and index, will 
serve to give their style. Writing in 1779 to 
her bosom friend. Lady Susan O'Brien, Lord 
Ilchester's daughter, she says : 

" I am sure, my dearest Ly Susan, to please you 
with my account of dear Harry Fox, who has spent a 
week here ; he is a good portly figure, but not a bit too 
fat to be active, stirring, an excellent walker, &, in 
short, it's nothing more than that he's inclined to fat. 
. . . All his accounts of the service are told with such 
modesty & propriety that it's charming; as to his

opinions, I dare not venture to give them for fear I 
should misquote his ideas by any mistakes, but this 
I'm certain of, he adores the Howes, he thinks America 
cannot be conquered, & laughs at the folly of suppos- 
ing it; he says the Americans never plunder without 
leave, he don't say so of the English ; he is tired of 
that sort of war, but longs to pursue all sorts, for tho' 
he don't say it I fancy his ambition is to be a general 
as soon as proper. . . . There are two fleets now at 
Spithead, one with troops for America, the other with 
old Mother Hardy [Admiral Sir Charles Hardy], as 
it's the fashion to call him. I am mighty busy just at 
present, having the command of a flying camp of 3 
tents with about 40 soldiers, who are all at work mov- 
ing a great lump of ground that stood in the way of 
my edifice, & which the dear old stupid laborers would 
have pretended to remove in about 4 years I suppose, 
but this detachment of Militia is quite a godsend to 
me, for it enlivens work most excessively." 

To those who, with Mr. Birrell, are fond of 
"turning off the turnpike of history to loiter 
down the primrose paths of men's memoirs of 
themselves and their times," this book will 
afford no little entertainment, all the more 
perhaps that the " men's memoirs " are in this 
case a woman's, and a very wide-awake wo- 
man's, too. For, to quote Mr. Birrell once 
more. Lady Sarah is emphatically not one of 
those " good, honest people who no sooner take 
pen in hand than they stamp unreality on 
every word they write." Her letters breathe 
the life and gaiety that characterized their 
writer. Percy Favor Bicknell. 



Shakespeare and the Critics.* 

Few indeed are the subjects concerning which 
the nations of the world have come to so good 
an understanding as concerning the poetic and 
dramatic supremacy of Shakespeare. German 
and Dane, Dutchman and Spaniard, French- 
man and Italian, Englishman and Russian, 
acknowledge here a common loyalty. Perhaps 
Shakespeare is drawing the nations together 
by a tie more' universal than that of the new 
learning of the Renaissance. At the moment 
when Professor Lounsbury is launching the 
first of a series of substantial volumes descrip- 
tive of " Shakespearean Wars," it is profitable 
to bear in mind that critics the world over 
seem less inclined to fall out about Shakespeare

than about any other subject imaginable. 
Specifically, the agreement seems general among 
intelligent readers everywhere that Shake- 
speare was not merely a child of genius, a rare 
poet, a keen observer, and a happy delineator 
of human action and passion ; but that he was 
withal an unrivalled dramatic artist. It is no 
longer the fashion to attribute his successes to 
an astonishing conjunction of untutored genius 
and good luck ; nor to assume that his depar- 
tures from trodden ways were due to his lam- 
entable ignorance. Surely no literary mon- 
uments have ever been the objects of more 
searching scrutiny than that to which these 
plays have been subjected during the past cen- 
tury. The result is comparable to the immense 
widening of man's conception of the universe 
upon the acceptance of the Copernican theory. 
There was a time when Galileo could hesitate 
and Bacon refuse to accept that theory, and 
Shakespeare criticism was in much the same 
stage little more than a century ago. If Gar- 
rick went beyond bounds in admiration for 
" the god of his idolatry," Dr. Johnson was 
there to assert that Shakespeare never has six 
lines without a fault, that Congreve had writ- 
ten a better descriptive passage than can be 
found in all Shakespeare, that Tate's alteration 
of the conclusion of " King Lear " was an im- 
provement. Garrick himself imagined he had 
done his author a service by clearing the play 
of Hamlet of " all the rubbish of the fifth act." 
Modern criticism, of which Lessing and Cole- 
ridge were the morning stars, has indeed thrown 
a much stronger light upon Shakespeare ; but, 
what is still more important, it has placed us 
at a more advantageous point of view. We 
now perceive clearly that these plays are greatly 
planned. Marlowe and Shakespeare saw, if 
Sidney did not see, that the dramatic art of 
Seneca had had its day, — if, indeed, it may be 
said to have had so much. If these dramatists 
were somewhat regardless of ancient lights, it 
was because, having the sun, they felt no need 
of other illumination. Shakespeare is quite as 
well aware what he is about as was Sophocles. 
If the mirror which the modern master holds 
up to nature be not more perfect than that of 
the Greeks, it is certainly more variously and 
widely faithful ; while the images it presents 
are none the less works of creative art. 

Such is the point of view at which modern 
sympathetic criticism has established us and 
which the minute research of scholars of sev- 
eral nationalities, headed by the Germans, en- 
ables us to defend. Professor Lounsbury's

volume is devoted to a history of the contro- 
versies that raged in the seventeenth century 
and throughout the eighteenth with respect to 
the legitimacy of the dramatic art of Shake- 
speare, and of the vicissitudes through which 
the reputation of the great dramatist had to 
pass before reaching a place beyond the reach 
of envy. We are informed that this is only 
the first of a series of volumes having to do 
with what the author chooses to term " Shake- 
spearean Wars." The title seems singular in 
view of the humane and peaceful temper which 
made the poet's contemporaries unanimous in 
applying to his name the epithet of gentle. 
Its grim irony is not lessened when we think 
who it was that prophesied (and how truly !) 
" I came not to send peace, but a sword." The 
next succeeding volume is to bear the sugges- 
tive title, " Shakespeare and Voltaire." A 
general enumeration of the contents of the 
volume now published may give some notion 
of its scope. Three chapters deal with the 
gradual development of the right view of 
Shakespeare's neglect of the dramatic unities 
of time and place ; one, respectively, upon the 
intermingling of the comic and the tragic, upon 
stage representations of bloodshed and violence, 
upon minor dramatic conventions (such as the 
use of prose, rhyme, and blank verse), and 
upon the alterations to which so many of the 
plays were subjected. There are two chapters 
upon the conflicting views of critics in the 
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and a 
final chapter dealing with the dramatist's dis- 
regard of the conventional theory of poetic 
justice. 

These important subjects Professor Louns- 
bury handles with clearness and vivacity. He 
has made a comprehensive survey of a field 
which has been too much neglected, and his 
book is, on the whole, a substantial contribu- 
tion to Shakespearean criticism. If he has 
fallen short of producing a model of the way 
literary history should be written, it is not 
because of any defect in learning or vigor. 
His analysis of his subject is perspicuous, his 
argument cogent, his general attitude sane and 
just. Such a combination of qualities is so 
comparatively rare that to ask for anything 
more may appear ungrateful. Both the style 
and the habit of mind frequently recall Ma- 
caulay, who was not, even in his own opinion, 
a good literary critic. There are some of the 
same mannerisms, there is a similar tone of 
being " cocksure," and, far worse, there is a 
similar tendency to disregard, or inability to 



perceive, the nuance — the delicate distinc- 
tions wherein the truth is apt to lie concealed. 
The similarity of the style to Macaulay's does 
not extend to the main excellences of that great 
stylist. The style of the book before us is 
sometimes diffuse and too frequently slipshod. 
There are some rather desperate attempts at 
humor, which may help us to account for 
the author's want of appreciation of Shake- 
speare's light word-play. Professor Lounsbury 
feels and expresses nothing but loathing for 
the " quips and cranks and wanton wiles " 
which are often so charming a feature of the 
plays, and which furnish such interesting evi- 
dences of the taste of that time and of the 
master's ability to do whatever he liked with 
words. But such considerations are too nice, 
involving as they do some degree of artistic 
self-detachment, — a thing quite foreign to this 
critic's robustly subjective habit of mind. 
Shakespeare's quibbles and plays upon words 
exemplify " the lowest form of intellectual de- 
pravity "; they are " dreadful," " execrable 
intellectually," " inexpressibly wretched," " vic- 
ious." A moral consolation is found in the 
theory that licentious allusions are generally 
wrapped up in verbal quibbles which have been 
rendered obscure by the changes in the mean- 
ings of words. It is easy to imagine what 
would have been Charles Lamb's comment 
upon all this. 

The author might easily have made the vol- 
ume of much greater value to scholars by 
being less chary of footnotes, by giving a 
greater number of facts in support of his gen- 
eralizations, and by taking care to give the 
reader an opportunity at every point to verify 
statements. The audience he has in view 
seems to be that intelligent middle class of 
readers who care more for the results than the 
processes of scholarship. At page 382, with 
reference to the early editions of Shakespeare's 
plays the following sentence occurs : '* Fur- 
thermore, wlien once 'published^ no one of his 
contemporaries equalled him in the frequency 
of republication during the century in which 
his death took place." The italics are mine. 
This is a sample of the author's manner of 
expressing himself, — style it can hardly be 
called. The careful reader is given no means 
of verifying this statement ; some bibliographi- 
cal data in a footnote would have been welcome. 
But the author has a fine scorn for the class of 
readers at whom he repeatedly sneers as the 
" select few." Speaking of Mason's " Carac- 
tacus," he takes occasion to remark : 



198 



THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



" It was a saying of Aristotle that the mass of men 
are better judges of music and poetry than a small 
number of them, however eminent. Mason's fortunes 
furnish an additional proof to the many that exist of 
the justice of the dictum, rightly understood. All the 
glorification of his poetry by the select few could never 
make him really popular " (p. 247). 

The reader is given no clue to the quotation 
from Aristotle and is left in doubt whether the 
dictum is " rightly understood " by the writer 
himself. Assuming that Aristotle made use 
of an expression equivalent to " the mass of 
men," did he mean by it just what the hasty 
reader whom the author is addressing will 
be likely to infer ? It does not appear that 
there was anything exclusively " select " about 
those who admired Mason in his day. Bos- 
well, for example, regarded " Caractacus " 
as a masterpiece ; Dr. Johnson ridiculed it. 
Possibly the expression " select few," as used 
here and elsewhere, is intended ironically ; but 
the class of readers who will be edified by such 
passages as the above will draw the inference 
that, with respect to Shakespeare, the critics 
have always been in the wrong and the uncrit- 
ical always in the right. Until the present 
volume shall be out of print, it will be cited 
on lecture platforms and in reading circles in 
support of the cheering democratic doctrine 
that a Bowery music-hall audience has, after 
all, a sounder taste in music than Mr. Theo- 
dore Thomas. In opposition to Professor 
Lounsbury's citation of Aristotle let us quote 
an authority at least as good in such matters : 
"... the censure of the which one must, in 
your allowance, o'erweigh a whole theatre of 
others." The great dramatist had quite as 
much regard as had Milton for the "fit audi- 
ence " and was quite as well aware that such 
an audience is always the few. If Shake- 
speare's audience has been relatively large, it 
has no doubt always included a fair sprinkling 
of the " select few." 

This volume is put forth under the auspices 
of a great university as one of the examples of 
the researches of its professors. It is but just 
that such a publication should be judged by a 
higher standard than that by which a volume 
of Sunday-evening lectures by the average 
clergyman is judged by the religious weekly 
of his denomination. The impression forces 
itself upon one that the author might have 
made the book much better, and that he has 
not deemed it worth his while to give anxious 
attention to details. Meanwhile to our chorus 
of indolent reviewers it makes no odds how a 
man writes nor how inexact may be his state- 



ments, so long as he presents us with a readable 
book, written in a confident tone. 

The reader of Professor Lounsbury's volume 
has scarcely turned a leaf before being con- 
fronted with a gratuitous assumption put for- 
ward with an air of positiveness. Referring 
to the early opinion that Shakespeare was the 
representative of nature and Ben Jonson of 
art, the author remarks that this distinction 
" May not be absolutely implied in the well-known ref- 
erence in ' L'Allegro ' to the * native woodnotes wild ' 
of Shakespeare and the • learned sock ' of Jonson. But 
in Milton's lines prefixed to the folio of 1632 there can 
be little question that, in asserting that the former 
writer's ease of composition was to the shame of slow- 
endeavoring art, the great Puritan poet had also the 
latter writer in mind." 

Passing over the clumsiness of the compo- 
sition, I must in justice to the author remark 
that, in his dialect, the formula " there can 
be little question " means little more than " it 
is just possible " from the pen of a cautious 
writer. It may also be suggested by the way 
that the young man who on this notable oc- 
casion first saw himself in print was yet far 
from being " the great Puritan poet." In the 
absence of evidence, there is every reason to 
assume that the young poet would not have 
seized upon precisely this occasion to gird 
at the first man of letters of the time ; a man 
whom Milton read and respected ; a man now 
advanced in years and extremely sensitive; 
and who would be sure to see the passage, 
placed as it was by the side of his own une- 
quivocal and enthusiastic tribute to the su- 
premacy of Shakespeare's art. As every 
student of Milton knows, his own art was of 
the " slow-endeavoring " kind, the numerous 
erasures and interlineations in his manuscripts 
giving proof that he was a poet of happy after- 
thoughts. He may have taken his cue from 
the words of Heminge and Condell : " His 
mind and hand went together : and what he 
thought he uttered with that easiness, that we 
have scarce received from him a blot in his 
papers." This would very naturally have sug- 
gested to Milton, by contrast, his own blotted 
papers. To adopt our author's formula, " There 
can be little question " that Milton has given 
us in this passage one of the first of his many 
autobiographical references; and that the con- 
trast he had in mind was that which, he felt, 
existed between the easy numbers of the great 
dramatist and those in which he himself 
plucked the unripe myrtle-berries " with forced 
fingers rude." 

I add a few brief corrections : At page 13

the play of " Hamlet " is said to " disregard 
utterly " the unity of place. On the contrary, 
this unity as defined at page 10 and as prac- 
ticed by Ben Jonson is strictly preserved in 
" Hamlet." The " plain in Denmark " (IV. 
iv.) is an unnecessary invention of the editors. 
Hamlet meets the troops on his passage from 
the castle, which overlooks the sea, to the neigh- 
boring place of embarkation. In the detailed 
analysis of the play of " Volpone " one of the 
most striking and dramatic incidents is over- 
looked : the attempt of the parasite Mosca to 
keep possession of the estate vs^hich has been 
temporarily handed over to him (V. iii). At 
page 307, the title of D'Avenant's play is 
misquoted. At page 138, a fine sentence 
from Dr. Johnson is quoted and pronounced 
"somewhat ambiguous." The sentence is 
quoted thus : " Tragicomedy, he said, ' how- 
ever generally condemned, her own laurels 
have hitherto shaded from the fulminations of 
criticism.' " Whereupon Professor Louns- 
bury comments : " The end apparently con- 
tradicts the beginning." Here he goes out of 
his way to condemn what he does not under- 
stand. Johnson's allusion is of course to the 
belief that the laurel cannot be hurt by light- 
ning. He says, in substance, that although 
thunderbolts have been launched against tragi- 
comedy, they have been ine£fectual. The 
bibliography, arranged by years, is not easy 
of reference when the date of a publication is 
not stated in the text. 

In conclusion I repeat that the book is not 
only interesting but well worth reading. Even 
those versed in the subject will gather sug- 
gestions from its pages. It is greatly to be 
hoped that, in the volumes that ate to succeed, 
the author will cultivate correctness and pre- 
cision of style, rather than vigor, of which he 
has enough and to spare ; that he will be more 
liberal in the disbursement of his stores of fact 
in exemplification of general statements ; that 
he will be less sparing of footnotes and exact 
references to authorities ; that, in short, he 
will direct his thought to a somewhat more 
exacting audience than he seems to have had 
in view. 

I have left myself too little space for an 
adequate tribute to the excellence of Dr. Fur- 
ness's noble edition of " Twelfth Night." This 
is the less to be regretted inasmuch as little is 
to be said of it except in the way of praise. The 
character and merits of the " New Variorum 
Edition of Shakespeare " are known to all 



scholars and have often been referred to in 
these columns. The first volume was published 
more than thirty years ago ; the one before us 
is the thirteenth. Inasmuch as two volumes 
were devoted to " Hamlet," and one to each 
of the other plays, " Twelfth Night " is the 
twelfth play in the series. In at least one im- 
portant respect Dr. Furness resembles his 
author : no one else could have improved upon 
his work. This " Variorum " edition is so 
much superior to anything of the kind ever 
thought of before that the early volumes were 
at once recognized as approaching about as 
near perfection as human work may. Yet it 
is hardly too much to affirm that every suc- 
ceeding issue of the series has been, in some 
important respect, superior to the foregoing. 
Perhaps Dr. Furness reached the limit beyond 
which " the force of Nature could no further 
go " in the edition of " Much Ado about 
Nothing " *; it is enough to say that the present 
volume does not perceptibly fall below its im- 
mediate foregoer. I have marked several minor 
lapses, — such they appear to me, — but it 
would be attributing undue importance to them 
to cite them here. In the course of the minute 
scrutmy of every word of a play and of every 
word about it, no human wit could remain in- 
variably unclouded. Amid such a din of voices, 
the voice of our great editor is always welcome, 
and is apt to be the one that leads the discus- 
sion back to sense and harmony. His union 
of brightness and urbanity is always charming. 
His chief defect is an occasional and, I think, 
an increasing tendency to supersubtlety. It 
is as a moderator of the extreme pronounce- 
ments of others that his fitness for his place at 
the head of the board is most happily shown. 
He holds his own in comparison with the best 
commentators, however celebrated their names, 
and has fairly earned his primacy among ed- 
itors of Shakespeare.

Colonial. XiAres and Penates.* 



It is perhaps seldom that two books pub- 
lished almost at the same time so complement 
each other as the recent volumes of Miss 
Singleton and Mr. Lockwood. The nearly 
simultaneous issue of these somewhat large 
volumes on the same subject hints rather at 
redundance and a necessity for deciding, like 
the small brother of the new twins, which we 
will keep. Happily here there is sufficient 
difference to make such decision unnecessary, 
and what one seeks in one book is tolerably 
sure to be found in the other, while even in the 
very limited field of genuine colonial furniture 
the illustrations and plates are duplicates in 
only one instance. 

To the lady all acknowledgements must be 
made for having upheld the reputation of 
women as conservators of the raw material, 
so to speak, of history, — the tradition, the 
legend, the old-time scandal, and the fairy tale, 
— which on feminine lips lies ever ready for 
repetition, for the instruction and the edifica- 
tion of the young. Miss Singleton's raw ma- 
terial is not exactly legend nor fairy tale, 
being matter obtained for the most part from 
inventories, price list proceedings, and law- 
suits ; but if repetition can accomplish anything 
she must be considered as one who has acted 
nobly. When nearly two-thirds of the text of 
a book carry quotation marks it is, even as 
evidence of mere industry, most impressive, — 
and it would be more were it not that when 
one settles down to read there comes a time 
when nobility palls, industry palls, and raw 
material palls, and if the subject is history one 
has an appetite for something with more in- 
terpretive value. 

This is where Mr. Lockwood comes in. He, 
without so much repetition, has an equal amount 
of industry and raw material, having also read 
all the inventories and bills of sale — it takes 
nigh seven years, if we may believe the pros- 
pectus, — but instead of extracts from his 
reading he tells " in his own words " a clear 
connected story of our furniture since the first 
pilgrim chests, cupboards, chairs, and beds 
landed on these shores. Without pedantry he 
has contrived to present the historical facts 
and much special information in a narrative so

exoteric that the novice can read it as freely 
as the expert. When there is no evidence on 
a certain point, the fact is stated with a freedom 
from surmise that is rare even in the best his- 
torical society ; and on the other hand, where 
there is evidence it is attached to its object 
with great clearness. In arrangement Mr. 
Lockwood's book follows the natural division 
of furniture into chairs, tables, and chests ; all 
is very orderly and straightforward, and this 
charm has been still further enhanced by plac- 
ing the illustrations where they belong — close 
to the text they illustrate. Taking it all in all, 
the volume is, I should imagine, the work of 
one with a well-tempered enthusiasm for his 
subject, well read and even learned in its his- 
tory, and willing to treat his learning as what 
the dramatic critics call reserve force. 

Miss Singleton as an historian has no idea 
of reserve force, but relentlessly insists on ex- 
hibiting the entire result of her industry ; and 
with inventories in extenso, letters, diaries, 
and proceedings, ad. lib., finally creates in a 
somewhat wearied mind an impression like a 
read-up lecture. The documents that Mr. 
Lockwood refers to merely. Miss Singleton 
quotes almost in their entirety. This has still 
the advantage of being complementary ; so that 
if to anyone the method of " Colonial Furniture 
in America " appears sketchy he can take up 
" The Furniture of our Forefathers " and verify 
each and every allusion. On the mechanical 
side, however, in the number and magnificence 
of the illustrations and the general " get up " 
of the book. Miss Singleton has a production 
that is really grand. Not only the number of 
the plates, but their variety also, are unusual, 
two of them, — the kitchen of the Hancock- 
Clarke house at Lexington, which is arranged 
as a kitchen museum, and the kitchen of the 
Whipple house at Ipswich, — being easily the 
most interesting things in either book. Mr. 
Lockwood hasn't so many pictures, but he has 
had the advantage of a clear aim to aid him 
in writing his book. This, as given in the 
earlier announcements, was to write a history 
of furniture in America with precise informa- 
tion on certain points, — such as the evidences 
of age, periods, and authorship, so that all who 
buy may read. Mr. Lockwood is to be con- 
gratulated first on his clear aim, and secondly 
on the scholarship and ability which enabled 
him to achieve it, and the public is to be con- 
gratulated on Mr. Lockwood. The tendency 
of the collector to endow his collection with a 
value out of proportion is occasionally evident,

but we still have to wait for an enthusiast who 
can say, like Nanki-Poo, 

" It is true that I adore with a passion that 's intense, 
But one ought not to ignore all the rules of common 
sense." 
It is rather a disappointment to find in both 
books that Colonial Furniture has always been 
so sophisticated — except for a few interesting 
objects which, being sheer utilities first, last, 
and all the time, do not bore one with aesthetic 
minauderies. With the objects which have a 
merely useful reason for existence one gets a 
pioneer flavor which is lacking in the stuff im- 
ported from London for honorific purposes. 
Looking back, the antiquity of many modern 
ideas is astonishing, some of them being an- 
cient enough to give distinction even to the 
Society, of which one has heard rumors, com- 
posed of those whose ancestors were killed in 
folding beds. There are of course plenty of 
histories of furniture already, but these two 
present the subject in the modern and sym- 
pathetic garb. Presuming that it is a some- 
what diiB&cult matter to treat interestingly, 
that it was necessary to treat it at all, and that 
the publications are something more than 
apropos of the Colonial Eenaissance of Grand 
Rapids, then we may consider that the subject 
of American furniture has been well attended to.

International. Public IiAtv.* 



In 1836 Henry Wheaton published his « Ele- 
ments of International Law." The work was 
at once recognized, in Europe and America, 
as a most important contribution to the liter- 
ature of the subject with which it dealt. It 
became a standard authority. Editions were 
published in London, Paris, and Leipsic. It 
was afterwards translated into Chinese, and 
published at the expense of the imperial gov- 
ernment. It was likewise translated into Ja- 
panese. The statesmen of the world have 
consulted its pages and been governed by its 
conclusions. While other Americans have 
written on this subject, and written well, Whea- 
ton's work has remained the monumental work, 
this country's greatest contribution to the lit- 
erature of the subject. Mr. Wheaton was a 
graduate of Brown, an able lawyer, and for a 
number of years the distinguished Reporter of 
the Supreme Court of the United States. He

served the country as a diplomat in Europe, 
and on his return to this country became a 
lecturer on International Law at Harvard. 
But the last edition of his work appeared in 
1866, and a new and exhaustive American 
treatise on the subject was much needed. To 
meet this need Hon. Hannis Taylor has written 
his treatise on " International Public Law." 
Mr. Taylor became favorably known through 
the publication in 1889 of his scholarly work 
on " The Origin and Growth of the English 
Constitution." That work clearly demonstrated 
that its author possessed scholarship and ability. 
In 1893 Mr. Taylor was appointed by Presi- 
dent Cleveland Minister to Spain, and for four 
years he represented this country with credit 
at the Court of Madrid. He is a graduate of 
the University of North Carolina. That he is 
fitted by his learning, his ability, his experience 
as a lawyer and diplomat, to write the work 
which has just appeared, will be, we think, 
conceded. It will also be conceded that Whea- 
ton's treatise is the only work which has been 
written in this country with which Mr. Taylor's 
work can be compared. President Woolsey's 
work, a most scholarly and valuable one, and 
one most properly held in very high esteem at 
home and abroad, was not intended to be as 
full and comprehensive as Wheaton's. But 
Mr. Taylor's work was undoubtedly intended 
to supplant Wheaton's, and has been written 
on as comprehensive a plan. The author has 
every reason to expect that his work will be 
recognized as a standard authority, and will 
be consulted in this country as Wheaton here- 
tofore has been. No book written nearly seventy 
years ago, however well written it may be, can 
hold its place as against a book reasonably 
well written and on an equally comprehensive 
plan, and which brings the subject down to the 
present time. Wheaton's book would have 
been displaced long ago had it not been for 
his accomplished editors, Mr. Dana and Mr. 
Laurence, whose valuable annotations made a 
new work on the subject unnecessary until 
recently. In saying that Wheaton's work will 
be " displaced " by Taylor's we do not mean 
to convey the impression that Wheaton will no 
longer be consulted. His opinions will no doubt 
be cited for years to come, as are the opinions 
of Grotius, Vattel, Burlamayin, Bluntschli, 
Bynkershoek, and others. The publicist will 
continue to cite Wheaton as the lawyer con- 
tinues to cite Blackstone and Kent. But 
Taylor's work is one which every publicist in 
the United States will find it necessary to have

on his shelves, and he will examine it when- 
ever he is in doubt as to the international usage 
of to-day on any given question. 

Mr. Taylor has written an excellent book, 
and one which meets a decided want. He has 
done his work in a scholarly way and his trea- 
tise is indispensable to every American pub- 
licist. He has not, however, produced a work 
which can for a moment be compared with the 
great work of Calvo's ; it is only fair to say 
that he did not attempt to. In 1868 M. Carlos 
Calvo published his great work in Spanish 
under the title of Derecho International Teo- 
rlco y Practico de Europa y America. It 
was afterwards translated into French as Le 
Droit International Theorique et Pratique. 
It is regarded in Europe and America as the 
leading treatise in existence on the subject of 
International Law. It is much to be regretted 
that no English translation of this most im- 
portant work has ever made its appearance. 
Such a translation should have been made long 
before this. 

The definition which Mr. Taylor gives of 
International Law is as follows : " The aggre- 
gate of rules regulating the intercourse of states, 
which have been gradually evolved out of the 
moral and intellectual convictions of the civil- 
ized world as the necessity for their existence 
has been demonstrated by experience " (p. 86). 
Again he says (p. 167) that International 
Law " is a system of rules created by civilized 
nations, since the beginning of the Reforma- 
tion, to regulate their intercourse with each 
other." In the light of his definition he tells 
us that the relation of international to natural 
law loses its importance. The importance of 
the relation depends wholly upon the view one 
entertains as to what really constitutes Inter- 
national Law. English writers insist that the 
only source of International Law is actual 
usage, and that no principle can be said to be 
a part of International Law until it has been 
actually incorporated into the usages of States. 
This is the theory of Hall, Laurence, and 
Walker, — all English writers. This was the 
theory advanced by Lord Russell, afterwards 
Chief Justice of England, in his argument be- 
fore the Tribunal of Arbitration at Paris, in 
1893, in the case between the United States 
and Great Britain respecting the Fur Seals. 
He there declared : 

" The phrase of Grotius, placuit ne gentibus, sums up 
the only possible and the only true idea of the law of 
nations; and when text-writers and theorists and dip- 
lomatists assert that such and such a usage is recognized 
by the law of nations, that such and such a right exists 



under the law of nations, in each case the criterion is 
not whether the rule so expressed, or the usage or the 
right so asserted, is humane, or is just, or is moral; the 
sole question is whether it has received the assent and 
consent of civilized nations: placuit ne gentibus f" 

This theory finds support in the judgments 
pronounced by Lord Chief Justice Coleridge 
and his associates in the Franconia case.* 
The counsel for the United States at Paris, 
Mr. James C. Carter, advanced a different 
theory, and cited in support of it the American 
writers on the Law of Nations, and some of 
the earlier English writers. His statement 
was that in determining in what International 
Law consisted we were to look to two sources : 
1. The practices and usages of nations ; 2. The 
law of nature. He said : 

" The points in which nations come into connection 
with each other, or into collision with each other, are 
comparatively few, and therefore the occasions for the 
study, the development, and the application of the law 
of nations have, in the course of history, been com- 
paratively few. For the most part, therefore, when 
new questions arise we are referred at once to the law 
of nature, which is the true source upon which the 
whole system of the law of nations rests; and these we 
are entitled to and to take as law, the plain deductions 
of right reason from admitted principles, unless we find 
that those plain deductions have, somewhere or some- 
how, been disavowed by the nations of the earth in 
their actual intercourse with each other." 

And Mr. Justice Harlan, who was one of the 

arbitrators, declared his opinion that 

" True wisdom, indeed the Treaty and public law, I 
submit, require that this Tribunal accept the doctrine 
that whatever is demanded by right reason, justice, and 
morality has the sanction of the law of nations, unless 
it has been otherwise determined by the general assent 
of mankind." t 

It would be absurd to suppose that Mr. Taylor 
is unaware of this discussion at Paris, although 
he has nothing to say about it. The question 
raised is fundamental and a matter of the 
greatest possible importance, and his attempt 
to dispose of the subject by his definition of 
International Law, and the declaration that in 
the light of his definition the relation of Inter- 
national Law to Natural Law loses its import- 
ance, is anything but satisfying. 

On some of the topics which he treats Mr. 
Taylor has not been as full and explicit as is 
desirable. Take, for example, the subject of 
reciprocity treaties. Does the treaty-making 
power confer on the Senate and President the 
right to make commercial treaties and thereby 
fix duties, regulate commerce, and raise revenue 
without the concurrence of the House of Rep-

resentatives ? Senator Cullom made a speech 
in the Senate the other day in which he an- 
swered the question in the affirmative. The 
House of Representatives evidently thinks 
otherwise. It is not a new question. It was 
before the Senate in 1844, and at that time 
the Committee on Foreign Relations, speaking 
through Ruf us Choate, reported that the Senate 
possessed no such power. The matter has been 
before the Senate at other times. When such 
treaties have been negotiated they have in- 
cluded a stipulation that they are not to 
become operative until Congress enacts the 
legislation necessary to carry them into effect. 
About all this Mr. Taylor is silent. 

Again, one could wish that Mr. Taylor had 
explained a little more fully the meaning of 
" the most favored nation " clause. To be 
sure, he says that it only refers to gratuitous 
privileges, and does not cover privileges granted 
on the condition of a reciprocal advantage 
(p. 375). But this is not entirely satisfactory, 
and if it were it would have been well to have 
made mention of the course pursued by Ger- 
many in 1875 in its construction of the clause 
in our treaty with Hawaii. The fears of some 
Congressmen at the present time that if we do 
our plain duty by making concessions to Cuba 
by way of tariff reductions, we shall have 
trouble with other nations having treaties with 
us which contain the " most favored nation " 
clause, only serves to show that there is con- 
siderable ignorance abroad as to what the 
clause means. That ignorance, we fear, is not 
likely to be much dispelled by anything Mr. 
Taylor has to say. 

In making mention of American writers on 
International Law the author (pp. 68 and 69) 
makes no mention of Gallaudet or Gardner. 
Neither of these writers made any great con- 
tribution to the literature of the subject, but 
they are as deserving of mention as some the 
author has named. 

Mr. Taylor sympathises with Mr. Cleveland's 
Venezuelan Message of December 17, 1895, and 
so, for that matter, does his critic. He speaks 
of Mr. Cleveland as " a resolute and far-sighted 
statesman," and that such is to be the verdict 
of history seems pretty well assured. The 
Monroe Doctrine, he says, is purely a creation 
of the executive power, and is to be classed 
with those sources of international law which 
rest upon instructions given by States for the 
guidance of their own courts and officers. In 
Mr. Taylor's opinion Great Britain by accept- 
ing arbitration of the Venezuelan Question has 



admitted that the United States is possessed 
of the primacy of the New World. 

Mr. Taylor treats the subject of Intervention 
quite fully, and justifies this country's interven- 
tion in Cuba by the general principles of Inter- 
national Law, and leaving the Monroe Doctrine 
entirely out of view. Recent disclosures from 
Berlin make it plain that the representatives 
of the Powers at Washington did not believe 
that the United States, after the receipt of the 
Spanish note of April 10, was justified in in- 
tervening. 

Notwithstanding the minor criticisms in 
which the writer has indulged, — and any work, 
no matter how carefully done, is always liable 
to such criticisms, — it is only fair to say that 
Mr. Taylor's work is a notable contribution to 
the literature of International Law, and that 
it will be welcomed by public men in England 
as well as in the United States. Mr. Taylor has 
completed his task in an admirable manner, and 
his book is really deserving of praise. Here 
and there we wish he had gone more into detail 
and been more specific. But the merits of the 
book greatly outweigh its minor defects, and 
it will undoubtedly long be recognized as a 
standard authority on International Law.

Travels and Studies in Armenia.* 



There is no such country, politically, as Ar- 
menia. But there is a section of Asia now 
ruled by at least two powers, which was form- 
erly, and is now in part, occupied by Armenians. 
This territory lies between Asia Minor on the 
west, the Caspian Sea on the east, and between 
the Black Sea and the river Kur on the north 
and northeast, and Persia and Mesopotamia on 
the south. It is traversed by some of the most 
picturesque of mountain ranges, and is the 
source of some great rivers, such as the Tigris 
and Euphrates. Its valleys and table-lands 
are pitched amid some of the grandest of moun- 
tain scenery, and are watered by the purest of 
springs and streams. 

Mr. H. F. B. Lynch, the author of two noble 
volumes on Armenia, made two trips to this 
region, one in 1893—4, and another in 1898. 
He had already spent a considerable portion

of 1889 and 1890 in Mesopotamia and Persia, 
and was quite familiar with the customs of this 
portion of Asia. Drawn by curiosity largely, 
he thoroughly equipped himself, and set out to 
make a comprehensive study of this country 
and its people. He admits, too, in the course 
of his discussions, that he was greatly interested 
to see how the Armenian problem appeared 
from an inside study. This led him to investi- 
gate carefully the condition of the population 
in each considerable city that he traversed. 

The first volume deals with the Kussian 
provinces of Armenia. The author sailed up 
the Black Sea, making an extensive stop at 
Trebizond, and landed at Batum, the western 
terminus of the Russian railway. Thence he 
entered Russian territory, crossing by stage into 
the Kur valley. The most notable halts in his 
next journey in the Araxes valley were Alex- 
andropol, Erivan, Ani, and Kars. Each of 
these, and many smaller places, he examined 
with great care, looking especially into the 
schools, the churches, the character of the popu- 
lation, and the ruins. Of some places, such as 
Kars and Ani, he goes into great descriptive 
detail, and gives a mass of useful information, 
the result both of others' investigations and his 
own. In some chapters, such as XVI. (pp. 228- 
315, on the Armenian Church), he gives long 
studies of historical interest, touching the Ar- 
menian peoples and their history. In connection 
with the chapter on Ani, we have an admirable 
summary, from the best sources, of " the Ar- 
menian kingdom of the Middle Ages." The 
most inspiring part of this volume is the de- 
scription of Mt. Ararat and the party's ascent 
of it — to an altitude of 16,916 feet. The 
writer's energetic style, and his admirably-taken 
photographs, carry the reader along with the 
party. The large map of Armenia also adds 
greatly to the vividness of impression made by 
the narrative. 

Volume II. deals with Mr. Lynch's expe- 
riences in the Turkish provinces of Armenia. 
Having crossed the backbone of the Aghri 
Dagh range of mountains, he went direct to 
Van, with its wonderful lake, fortress, and 
dead crater. There is no more interesting spot 
in all Armenia than Lake Van and its sur- 
roundings. The author took careful measure- 
ments, examined sites, and gives us an admirable 
summary of his results. We are glad to see 
that he notes with full credit the investigations 
of the German Assyriologists, Belck and Leh- 
mann, in this region within the last decade. 
These scholars established several facts in re- 



gard to the relation of Assyria to this country 
in the most prosperous period of the Ninevite 
empire. Erzerum, the strongest fortress in 
Turkish Armenia, receives large attention both 
for its local and for its political importance. 
It is practically the key to this section of Ar- 
menia, and its capture by Russia at any time 
would mean the loss to Turkey of this great 
region. 

Some of the author's diary notes are not of 
special interest to the reader, but such can be 
easily passed by, and he can go on to the de- 
scriptions of localities, of mountain ranges, and 
to his studies of geographical, political, and 
historical subjects. 

One chapter (XXIV.) of the second volume 
is a graphical summary of the statistical and 
political status of Armenia. On the basis of 
the best statistics at command, he finds in 
Turkish Armenia 387,746 Armenians, and in 
the Russian provinces 906,984, being about 
one-third of the whole population of the former 
district, and nearly two-fifths in the latter. We 
are glad to find in the Appendix the " National 
Constitution of the Armenians in the Turkish 
Empire," which was granted by the Porte in 
1862. 

The Bibliography of twenty-six pages is all 
one could wish for a full study of Armenia, 
historically, ecclesiastically, politically, or geo- 
graphically, including even the philological 
study of the Vannic inscriptions. The tinted 
photographs and the many plans and charts 
that fill up the volumes make a splendid equip- 
ment for a popular study of some of the urgent 
problems presented to-day by the peoples of 
Armenia. Ira M. Price.

and for the comprehension of such present-day 
topics as mental treatment, faith-cures, fads, and 
mental obliquity generally. While hysteria pre- 
sents certain fairly well definable groups of symp- 
toms, yet these appear in protean variability, to be 
recognized only by the expert ; and in the end the 
interpretation of the symptoms themselves depends 
upon the central psychological conception of the 
malady. A peculiar and interesting enfeeblement 
of the faculty of psychological synthesis, a weak- 
ness of the will, a contraction of the field of con- 
sciousness ; a suppression of certain of the sensory 
stimuli by the fact that consciousness is not at home 
to them ; a consequent favoring of a tendency 
toward a dissolution of the personality and the 
formation of parasitic groups of ideas, — these are 
some of the psychological generalizations which 
bring under a provisional unity the endless series 
of symptoms which hysteria reveals. It is clearly 
more the exaggeration or perversion of a tempera- 
ment than a disorder ; and as a temperament con- 
tributes much to that which makes life interesting 
and complex, sincerity and disingenuousness diffi- 
-cult, deception and self-deception easy. Dr. Janet 
has presented the problem with m asterly skill from 
the professional side. A popularization of the field 
he has so successfully exploited would not be with- 
out public usefulness. 

" Chivalry," by Mr. H. Warre Cor- 
nish, is the sixth published volume 
in the " Social England Series " 
(Macmillan). Noting the title of the series, one 
naturally expects to find a treatment of chivalry as 
■developed in England; and it is somewhat sur- 
prising to find that the material on England, if 
abstracted, would amount to not more than an 
eighth of the book. It is true that the ceremonies of 
chivalry took slight hold in England ; yet it would 
be possible to take the contemporary life of conti- 
nental Europe as a background, and deal with 
English chivalry, such as it was, more in detail. 
This is our first serious criticism. Three other 
faults are conspicuous, since they detract from the 
value of the book as a work of reference : there 
are numerous quotations from Old French and Old 
English, with scattering ones from other languages, 
which should be translated in notes or appendix ; 
there should be a glossary of obsolete words, and 
of terms peculiar to the science of heraldry, etc.; 
there is no index. In spite of these defects, how- 
ever, and of a lack of clearness in the author's 
style, the book contains much information valuable 
and interesting to the " general reader," the peruser 
of historical novels, and the student who is not a 
specialist but who wishes a sketch of social life during 
one of the most fascinating periods of the world's 
history. Take it all in all, a fairly comprehensive 
picture is here presented of life among the upper 
classes from the eleventh to the sixteenth century. 
Knighthood, with its attendant panoply and cir- 
cumstance, was the mainspring; the virtues of

honor, courage, pride, liberality, love of ladies 
were the ruling principles. The Crusades strength- 
ened the order of knighthood and supplied a mo- 
tive. When the Crusades ceased, chivalry became 
more and more a mere form and ceremonial, and 
gradually died out. That its principles were fre- 
quently violated, goes almost without saying ; and 
it is equally true that its standards of purity and 
justice were not ours, and that along with their 
virtues the knights had faults which show them as 
partly savages. Nevertheless, chivalry, by means 
of the crusades, by means of the literature it 
brought forth, by means of the new ideals it 
brought to rude and warlike men, left its mark for 
good on all later history. This Mr. Cornish proves 
conclusively, opposing himself to those students of 
history who " can see nothing in chivalry but the 
exaggeration of the military spirit, a childish cere- 
monialism, and the degradation of the family by an 
unnatural code of gallantry." The book contains 
many interesting illustrations, reproduced from old 
prints. 

The famous Siena, unfortunately, does not lie 

art-pavement directly upon the most frequented 

at Stena. routes of Italian travel, and has been 

unreasonably slighted by tourists and little visited 
save by the adventurous. Hence scant justice has 
been done to the contributions she is capable of 
making to art history. The Duomo is but a tran- 
sept of the building projected in the eleventh cen- 
tury, when Siena was in her prime, — a formidable 
rival of Florence, — and wanted to build a cathedral 
that would be second to none in Italy. But she 
suffered irreparably in the great plague of 1348 ; 
and the following year, abandoning the plans 
for the building she wanted and contenting herself 
with the building she had ( which is yet thought by 
competent critics the most beautiful in Italy), she 
began the ornamentation of that, and succeeded in 
making it especially rich in art treasures. It has 
frescos attributed to Pinturricchio after designs by 
Raphael, choir-stalls and intarsia work by Giovanni 
da Verona, a sculptured monument supposed to be 
by Michel Angelo, besides paintings by artists who 
made forever famous the Sienese School of the 
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. But, most 
important of all, it has " The Pavement." The 
floor of the entire structure presents a scheme of 
pictures not altogether Christian or religious, but 
extremely interesting, and particularly so to the 
student of art archaeology. It differs from ordinary 
mosaic (excepting in one panel), and belongs to a 
class of work that " seems to have been peculiar to 
the artistic mind of the Sienese." There are only 
three other similar pavements in existence, and of 
these two are in Siena and the third is in Lucca, 
not a hundred miles distant. This Duomo pavement 
is made the subject of an illustrated volume of 155 
pages, by Robert H. Hobart Cast, M.A., on " The 
Pavement Masters of Siena," to serve as the initial 
volume of a series of '^ Handbooks of the Great

Craftsmen " (Macmillan). There were fifty-four 
" Pavement Masters," including those who in the 
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries have worked 
upon the restoration of the original designs. Of 
some of the fifty-four, absolutely nothing is known 
but that they did their work and received their 
pay. Most of them are unknown to fame, but at 
least two of them — Matteo di Giovanni and Do- 
menico Beccaf umi — have high places in the " fair 
and luminous record " of the Sienese school of art. 
The chapter Mr. Oust devotes to these workers 
evinces very careful researches among the archives 
of the Cathedral ; and not only is the volume a 
valuable contribution to popular art history, but it 
whets the reader's appetite for the forthcoming 
issues of the series.

For the man who (Doubledav) records the successful

experiment of a man who was tired 
of endlessly camping out in a flat that cost a fourth 
of his income, and willing to undergo all sorts 
of temporary deprivations and discouragements for 
the sake of the final recompense, a real home of 
his own. How he and his wife — who, if not always 
quite of his mind, loved him enough to trust in 
him — surrendered gentility for two years that they 
might later go house-hunting through the environs 
of New York City, and how, having made their 
choice, they transformed it into the veritable home 
beautiful of their dreams, is the theme of the book. 
The affair is related as it happened, — so the author 
assures us, — with no fictitious glamour of romance 
to delude the young couple who may haply be 
tempted to go and do likewise ; and from a literary 
as well as from a practical point of view, it is this 
pervasive note of reality that constitutes the charm 
of the story. A country lawyer, a Swedish maid, 
a pair of lovers who meet and woo under the new 
vine and fig-tree, a married couple who scoff at life 
in a cottage and make their own disastrous attempt 
to escape from the same humdrum round that dis- 
mayed the hero and heroine, — all these add variety 
to the main thread of the narrative. But the real 
value of the book lies in its suggestive and yet 
definite answer to a question that must come some- 
time to every man with a small income and a family : 
" How, if we keep on renting a house, are we ever 
going to have a home?" Every such man will 
appreciate " The Making of a Country Home."

In Mr. Arthur Kenyon Rogers's 
" Student's History of Philosophy "

lege classes of not very advanced standing, as also 
to the general reader who is taking his first some- 
what uncertain steps along the path of philosophic 
knowledge. That the number of readers of the

latter class will scarcely be less than that of the 
former is apparent from the ever increasing ten- 
dency of broad-minded men and women to seek the 
origin and connection of present-day thoughts and 
problems in and with those of the past, since ideas 
no less than events have their history. The sim- 
pler and less abstruse such a presentation is, the 
greater, of course, will be its aid and the more 
effective the introduction it can afford to the books 
of larger scope and more specific character. That 
the subject sometimes revenges itself, as it were, on 
the author for treating weighty matters so lightly, 
and breaking the edge of their obscurity so com- 
pletely (in response to the needs of inexperienced 
minds), is seen in his occasionally falling into the 
habit of offering explanations that are no whit 
clearer than the thesis, and in his frequent relapse 
into a hasty conversational style that is chatty 
when compared with the utterances of the old sages 
whom he quotes and whose every phrase is sur- 
charged with meaning that seems to mock the pov- 
erty of words. But while Mr. Rogers's book can 
in no way compare with, for example, Windel- 
band's exact and learned work, it should neverthe- 
less be judged on its own merits ; and among these 
we count its conquest of the practical difficulties of 
the case, which are not small. They are here met 
not only by great familiarity with the ideas pre- 
sented, but also by an individual mode of present- 
ing them, by general accuracy in treatment, by a 
happy habit of quoting extensively from the philos- 
ophers, and by an earnestness that lets no problem 
drop until it has to some extent been viewed from 
all sides. In our opinion, the author is most suc- 
cessful where he treats of problems that touch upon 
our modern ideas of life and the world, where he 
naturally has more light to guide him. He is less 
convincing when he portrays the remoter life of 
the mind ; but in this he shares the fate of many 
of his kind. On the whole it may be said that 
while the defects of the book may to some extent 
mar the enjoyment of it to those who are already 
far advanced in philosophic study, these defects 
would not generally interfere with its usefulness to 
those whom it especially strives to benefit.

quarters of the nineteenth century (1802-73), and 
the long list of illustrious painters and authors who 
were his contemporaries reminds us once more that 
this period is one which will be looked back upon 
by posterity as one of the most brilliant in the an- 
nals of the history of culture. Among these names, 
Landseer's, not one of the greatest, was certainly 
one of the most popular ; he chose his subjects from 
every- day life, he knew how to tell a story with his 
brush, and he won the heart of the English-speaking 
world. Much greater artists may well envy him 
his unique fame. — The tenth volume of the same 
series is given to Correggio, who, although one of 
the half-dozen most famous painters in the his- 
tory of art, as a personality is one of the least 
known. The legends and misapprehensions of his 
first biographer, Vasari, passed unquestioned until 
about thirty years ago ; but within the last quarter 
of a century, we have had two scholarly studies of 
the life and works of the artist, — Dr. Julius 
Meyer's in German and Signor Carrado Ricci's in 
Italian. Both have been translated into English, 
and Miss Hurll's little book is based on these au- 
thorities. Within its limits, it may be commended 
to beginners in the study of art history. 

A new Dooiey Neither of Chicago's most prominent 
book and tome humorists lacks honor in his own 
fables in slang. gountry. Mr. George Ade has slain 
his thousands and Mr. Peter Dunne his ten thou- 
sands. The journals that contain their contribu- 
tions are more eagerly sought for than the special 
editions of the Congressional Record. Mr. Ade's 
" Modern Fables " (Russell) have been introduced 
as supplementary reading into eleven university 
courses in modern dialect, while Mr. Dooley's opin- 
ions rank in many quarters above those of the 
United States Supreme Court. All in all, Mr. Dooiey 
has a better i^avor than the Fables. It is not only 
that brogue is more lovable and more forgivable 
than slang; Dooiey on the whole "makes for 
righteousness," while the satire of the Fables gives 
a sub-cynical reaction when held in a current of 
fresh air. Both writers reflect phases of contem- 
porary life that will escape the novelist and the 
historian ; but Dooley's is a magic mirror that shows 
behind the picture of unhappy things that are a 
shadowy image of what ought to be. Mr. Ade's 
studies of the vulgar female man-hunter, the hypo- 
critical "leading citizen," the variegated "dead- 
beat," the empty-pated " Chawley-boy," and their 
kin ought, indeed, to disgust, as do the pictures of 
Hogarth's " Rake's Progress," but there is not a 
little danger that incipient members of these groups 
will think the types intended for heroes. Mr. 
Dooiey, to be sure, is keener and gentler and fairer 
than the dispenser of " five cints' worth iv flude 
exthract iv hell f 'r fifteen cints " on Archey Road 
could possibly be ; but we are more willing to have a 
man rise above himself than to sink below. "We can 
laugh over both books, but it is to Mr. Dooiey rather 
than to the Fables that we turn for a second perusal. 



Modern methods of scholarly investi- 
i/th^mbrlw* gation are producing wide-reaching 

results in the field of Old Testament 
study. The Rev. R. L. Ottley's " Short History of 
the Hebrews " (Macmillan) is another serious at- 
tempt to popularize the newest results announced 
by critics of the Old Testament. The book is a 
presentation, in narrative form, of the history, so- 
called, of the Hebrews from the beginning down to 
the Roman period. The narrow limits of 324 pages 
made this a hazardous undertaking. Upon an ex- 
amination of the author's method of compressing his 
material to fit this space, we discover the expected 
defects. He has attempted too much. If he had 
satisfied himself by introducing fewer unsolved 
problems and unanswered questions, the book would 
have been more readable and less discouraging to 
the bulk of readers. Since he has introduced many 
such problems, at least comparative completeness 
required that he should have given the best answers 
that modern scholarship proposes, thus considerably 
enlarging the work. As it is, Kittel's work — which 
he closely follows, especially in the patriarchal and 
nomadic stages of Israel's history — is quite superior 
to the condensed book before us. If the reader is 
already familiar with the outline facts of the He- 
brew history, he will find these twelve chapters an 
orderly arrangement of that matter, though pre- 
senting nothing strikingly new. The book is sup- 
plied with seven well-executed maps, done by 
Stanford ; also chronological tables, list of works 
consulted, and an index. We are still waiting for 
the strictly up-to-date history of the Hebrews. 

In " Letters on Life " (Dodd, Mead 
fTatSrer,. & Co.), Dr. Robertson Nicoll, writ- 

ing under the pseudonym of " Clau- 
dius Clear," gives a series of brief essays on a 
variety of every-day subjects, written in the terse 
style of a man whose observations of life have 
made him sure of his ground. Of special interest 
at the moment is the chapter on " Firing out the 
Fools," a bit of advice to Englishmen to adopt the 
more aggressive and successful business methods of 
the New World. This is followed by two other 
chapters touching upon other phases of the same 
subject. " Good Manners," " The Sin of Over- 
work," " The Art of Conversation," are titles that 
indicate the range of the nearly thirty chapters. 
In all of them there is wholesome good-sense and 
wise helpfulness, presented with such point and 
pith and breezy freshness as atone for the sin of 
didacticism. There is something in the book for 
everyone, man or woman, scholar or workingman, 
and almost all of it is full- of vitalizing good for 

anyone. 

Taies of the About the Great Indian Mutiny of 

great mutiny 1857 there has gathered a mass of 

told anew. heroic story unsurpassed in all his- 

tory. Nothing can appeal more strongly to the 
masculine love of daring and steady bravery than 
the story of the handful of British soldiers who

THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



grimly reduced to subjection the swarms of native 
soldiers whom they had themselves trained to high 
efficiency. Dr. W. H. Fitchett has told anew, in 
popular form, the thrilling story that gathers about 
the cities of Cawnpore, Lucknow, and Delhi, in his 
" Tale of the Great Mutiny " (imported by Scrib- 
ner). It is full to the brim of ghastly horrors, yet 
the deeds of the heroic officers, and of the equally 
heroic rank and file, faithful natives as well as 
British, stir the blood. It is good for our boys, in 
these prosaic days, to see to what almost impos- 
sible achievements men can be inspired by the 
combination of patriotism, courage, and fidelity to 
duty. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



We have received from the Government Printing 
Office at Washington the Keport of the Librarian of Con- 
gress for the year ending last June. The volume is 
much *niore than a mere report, for it includes a man- 
ual of the library organization, a select list of recent 
purchases, an account of the new plan for the distribu- 
tion of catalogue cards, and much other matter of more 
than transient interest, besides numerous illustrations. 
•' A List of Books on Samoa and Guam " comes to us 
from the same source, as also a pamphlet scheme of 
classification in the department of bibliography and 
library science. 

Mr. Russell Sturgis's ** Dictionary of Architecture 
and Building " (Macmillan) has already received ex- 
tended notice in these columns, and the appearance of 
the third and last -volume of the set serves in no wise 
to alter the impression created by the preceding parts. 
The work is one of great interest and value, being 
more than a dictionary, almost an encyclopaedia. The 
lack of care looking toward a piece of beautiful book- 
making in the matter of illustrations continues through- 
out the work; and now and again the illustrations do 
not serve to illustrate, — as in the definition of " clear- 
story," where the cut represents, and is labeled, " a 
church without a * clearstory.' " However, a large and 
efficient corps of expert writers on architecture and 
kindred subjects has served to present a comprehensive 
and authoribsttive work in a field where it was much 
needed. 

The success attained by the previous issues of the 
" Department of Special Editions " of Messrs. Hough- 
ton, Mifflin & Co. has resulted in a determination on 
the part of the publishers to produce from six to eight 
volumes of the same sort each year. The first of the 
issues for this Spring is a reprint of the address on 
" Democracy " delivered by James Russell Lowell at 
Birmingham, England, in 1884. It forms a little vol- 
ume of seventy-five pages, produced in similar general 
style to the edition of Thoreau's " Of Friendship," pub- 
lished last Fall, and shows the same artistic and intel- 
ligent workmanship in all the details of mechanical 
make-up. A short introductory note is supplied by the 
late Horace E. Scudder. This volume will be followed 
shortly by reprints of Sir Walter Raleigh's account of 
« The Last Fight of the Revenge at Sea," Henry Field- 
ing's "Journal of a Voyage to Lisbon," and (most 
acceptable of all) a complete edition of the Poems of 
Edward Rowland Sill. 



Annoltncements op Spring Books. 

Herewith is presented The Dial's annual list of 
books announced for Spring publication, containing this 
year more than 750 titles. With a few necessary ex- 
ceptions, books recently issued which have been already 
entered in our regular List of New Books are not 
named in the present list; and all the books here given 
are presumably new books — new editions not being 
included unless having new form or matter. The list 
is compiled from authentic data supplied for this pur- 
pose by the publishers themselves, and it is believed 
presents an accurate survey of the Spring books of 
1902.

Notes. 



Shakespeare's " Julius Caesar," edited by Dr. Ray- 
mond M. Alden, is a school text published by Messrs. 
B, H. Sanborn & Co. 

A third edition of " Pen and Ink," by Mr. Brander 
Matthews, is one of the recent publications of Messrs. 
Charles Scribner's Sons. 

Mr. William R. Jenkins publishes an edition of M. 
Rostand's "Cyrano de Bergerac," edited for school use 
by Mr. Reed Paige Clark. 

"Pendennis," in three volumes, is added to the 
charming edition of Thackeray now in course of publi- 
cation by Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co. 

A new edition of Mr. Henry T. Finck's " Romantic 
Love and Personal Beauty " (now fifteen years old), in a 
single volume, has just been issued by the Macmillan Co. 

'• Hold Redmere," by Messrs. Thomas Wood Ste- 
vens and Alden Charles Noble, is a pretty little book 
written in archaic style, and printed in black letters to 
match, sent to us by the Alwil Shop, Ridgwood, N. J. 

Mr. Irving Babbitt has edited for Messrs. D. C. 
Heath & Co. the text of Renan's " Souvenirs d'Enfance 
et de Jeunesse," unfortunately in a form not absolutely 
complete, although the omissions are not considerable. 

A volume of •* Lectures on the Theory of Econom- 
ics," by Professor Frederick Charles Hicks, is published 
by the University of Cincinnati Press. The author's 
treatment of the subject is essentially orthodox, and 
his references are to the best literature from Mill to 
the present time. 

Ten Brink's treatise on " The Language and Metre of 
Chaucer," in the second edition revised by Herr Fried- 
rich Kluge, is now translated by Mr. M. Bentinck 
Smith, and published by the Macmillan Co. Teachers 
of Middle English will appreciate the value of this new 
piece of apparatus for their work. 

The first volume of a '< Cours Complete de Langue 
Fran^ais," by Professor Maxime Ingres, is published 
by the University of Chicago Press. With the excep- 
tion of a somewhat unnecessarily polemical introduc- 
tion, the work is entirely in French. We find no 
statement of the number of volumes that are to follow. 

Kant's ** Prolegomena to any Future Metaphysics," 
edited in English by Dr. Paul Carus, is the latest addi- 
tion to the series of " Philosophical Classics " published 
by the Open Court Publishing Co. Besides the text of 
this immensely important work we are given, in an ap- 
pendix, a considerable amount of critical supplementary 
matter from various sources. 

The G. W. Dillingham Co. send us a volume con- 
taining a complete reprint of "Josh Billings' Old 
Farmer's Allminax," of which the annual appearances, 
during the decade of the seventies, afforded mild 
amusement to persons having a primitive sense of hu- 
mor. It may yet raise a faint smile, but how hope- 
lessly old-fashioned it all seems! 

We welcome to the company of serious American 
reviews " The South Atlantic Quarterly," which comes 
to us from Trinity College, Durham, N. C, and is 
edited by Mr. John Spencer Bassett. It is a dignified 
journal, of the type already represented in the South 
by " The Sewanee Review," and the contents of the 
opening number are of such a character as to inspire 
confidence in the future of the undertaking. This is 
precisely the sort of periodical of which our country

THE DIAL.

stands in the greatest need, and we hope that it will 
receive the cordial support which it deserves. 

A new edition of Professor Arber's " British Anthol- 
ogies," with portrait illustrations, is in course of pub- 
lication by Mr. Henry Frowde. For example, " The 
Milton Anthology," now at hand, gives us portraits of 
Milton, Conley, Davenant, Graham, Herrick, Lovelace, 
and Waller. The complete set of ten volumes con- 
tains two thousand poems by four hundred poets, and 
the portraits number sixty-four. 

" La Chronique de France " for 1901, " publide sous 
la direction de Pierre de Coubertin," is an interesting 
volume that has just come to our table. It offers a 
discussion of all sorts of subjects that interest French- 
men at the present day, from the Affaire Dreyfus to 
the Nobel awards. The associations problem, the 
French colonial empire, and labor politics, are among 
the larger subjects that come up for treatment. 

"Geschichten von Deutschen Stadten," by Herr 
Menco Stern, is a publication of the American Book 
Co. It is a volume of school readings in German 
geography, supplied with a map, a vocabulary, and a 
few wood cuts. The same publishers send us a " Mac- 
beth " volume of " Shakespeare Studies," prepared by 
Miss Charlotte Porter and Miss Helen A. Clarke ; also 
a " Latin Composition for Classes Reading Csesar," by 
Miss Anna Cole Mellick. 

" Hochelaga Depicta," a work by Newton Bosworth 
published at Montreal in 1839, is now reprinted in fac- 
simile by Messrs. Congdon & Britnell, Toronto. This 
volume is intended to be the first of a series of re- 
prints of rare books relating to the early history of 
Canada, and tbus represents an enterprise that is worthy 
of the most cordial support. We trust that the pub- 
lishers will be so successful with this venture that they 
will be encouraged to continue the series. 

There are many thousands of Americans who will be 
grieved to learn of the death on March 5, in his Surrey 
home, at the age of sixty-nine, of Benjamin Franklin 
Stevens. Although he had made England his place of 
residence (and of his business) since 1860, he had re- 
mained in close touch with the life of his native coun- 
try, through his official function as United States 
Despatch Agent, his constant relations with American 
libraries, and his work for American historical scholar- 
ship. He was, in a way, the leader of the American 
colony in London, and the fellow-countrymen who par- 
took of his generous hospitality and profited by his 
friendly services remember him with grateful affection. 
Like his brother, the late Henry Stevens, he was a 
Green Mountain Boy by birth, although he did not join 
in the whimsical affectation of the former by adding 
G. M. B. to the list of his titles. His series of fac- 
similes of historical manuscripts and other laborious 
publications, earned for him the deepest respect of 
American historians, and remain as the lasting memo- 
rial of his active and useful career.

A Summer Trip not 
Surpassed on the Continent. 

The trip to Salt Lake City, or to the Pacific coast 
via that point over the Denver & Rio Grande and 
the Rio Grande Western is the most beautiful in 
America. No European trip of equal length can 
compare vpith it in grandeur of scenery or wealth 
of novel interest. Then Salt Lake City itself is 
a most quaint and picturesque place and well 
worth the journey. Its Mormon temple, taber- 
nacle, tithing oflSce and church institutions; its 
hot sulphur springs within the city limits; its 
delightful temperature, sunny climate and its 
Great Salt Lake — deader and denser than the 
Dead Sea in Palestine — are but a few features 
of Salt Lake City's countless attractions. There 
are parks, drives, canons and beautiful outlying 
mountain and lake resorts. Imagine, if you can, 
a bath in salt water a mile above sea level and 
in water in which the human body cannot sink. 
Inquire of your nearest ticket agent for low 
tourist rates to Salt Lake City, or write for 
information and copy of " Salt Lake City, the 
City of the Saints," to S. K. Hooper, general 
passenger agent, Denver, Colo.

The New World and the 
New Thought 

By 
REV. JAMES THOMPSON BIXBY. Ph.D., 

Author of « The Ethics of Evolution," etc. 
12mo, cloth, $1.00 net. 



In "The New World and the New Thought" Dr. James T. Bixby 
calls attention to the immense expansion of the universe in space and 
time and the radical reconstruction of our ideas as to its nature and 
government, due to modern discoveries. If faith is to hold its ground 
there is required an analogous enlargement in our religious conceptions 
and radical modifications in the popular theology. The author, bow- 
ever, does not dwell so much on the destructive side of the theme as 
on the constructive. By fresh interpretations and arguments, as rev- 
erent as they are reasonable and scientific, he shows that modem 
knowledge may supply new confidence in the Divine Existence and 
Personality, a stronger sanction for morals, more inspiring views of the 
Bible, and a more effective Christianity. The reasoning is profound 
and original, its handling logical and strong, the style and illustrations 
clear and attractive ; and its frankness and philosophic insight into 
some of the knottiest problems of the day distinguish it as a volume of 
unusual timeliness and notable merit.

The Assassins. 

By NEVILL M. MEAKIN. Price, $1.50. 

It has been left for a new author of decided 
power to take for his central theme " The 
Assassins " of the " Old Man of the Mountain," 
-whom Sir Walter Scott and Mr. Hewlett have 
touched only in episode- The field opened to 
the imagination by their half-legendary story 
has always been fascinating, and Mr. Meakin 
has worked it worthily. In any romance of the 
time of the Crusades, Sultan Saladin must, of 
course, be a prominent figure. Here he is 
treated most sympathetically and from a point 
of view not hitherto exploited. 



The Winding Road. I 

By ELIZABETH GODFREY Price, $1.50. 

The author shows distirtct progress in her art, 
and this novel should increase her public and 
the regard in which many discriminating read- 
ers already hold her work. The story tells of 
the love between a half-gypsy genius and a 
woman willing to go against her nature and 
experience for his sake. The plot is quite full 
of action, based on the development of character 
strongly drawn; the scene, constantly shifting 
through rare by-ways of Europe, is full of an 
atmosphere that makes the reader feel out of 
doors. 



THE WOOING OF SHEILA. By Grace Rhys. M Impression. $1.50.

Fleming H. Revell Company's Spring Issues 



PRIMITIVE SEMITIC RELIQIOiN TO-DAY. By Samuei. Ives Cubtiss, d.d. 

A Record of Researches, Discoveries, and Studies in Syria, Palestine and the Sinaitic Peninsula, 
by the Professor of Old Testament Literature and Interpretation, Chicago Theological Seminary. Fully 
illustrated, including some reproductions of photographs of points and places which have not appeared in 
print to date. 8vo, cloth, gilt top, $2.00 net. 

The special fitness of Dr. Curtiss for the great task involved in the preparation of this volume lies in the fact that 
his whole life effort has l^n along this line of scholarly research. To the usual Preparatory, Collegiate, and Theological 
courses. Dr. Curtiss added four years of special preparation under Prof. Franz Delitzschat the University of Leipzig. For 
the past twenty years he has taught and lectured at the Chicago Theological Seminary, and quite recently has spent four- 
teen months in tours throughout the land to which this volume pertains. Through opportunities rarely afforded the 
traveler. Dr. Curtiss has been able to add a distinct contribution to the literature of Bible study and comparative religion. 
Competent critics declare this book to be quite in the nature of a discovery. It is certainly one of surpassing interest. 

MUSINGS BY CAMP-FIRE AND WAYSIDE. By W. C. Gray, late editor 
of The Interior. Small 8vo, 350 pages, deckle-edge paper, illustrated by duo-prints from photographs 
taken by Dr. Gray. Rich cover design, $1.50. 

Dr. Newell Dwight Hillis in speaking of the book says : " What subtle interpretations in these pages I What sympa- 
thy with his fellows I What knowledge of man as well as of Nature I What love of God ! What an atmosphere of 
hope and victory fill these rages I These * Musings by Camp- Fire and Wayside ' harvest the best things of a life long and 
wise and full of inspiration.'* 

MOSAICS FROM INDIA. By Margaret B. Deming. 

Talks About India, Its Peoples, Religions, and Customs. Illustrated. 12mo, cloth, $1.25 net. 

Mrs. Deming has succeeded in bringing India, with all its strange peoples and customs, very near and very real to 
ns. Nor has she confined her observations to any particular class, for high caste and low caste are alike vividly presented. 
She has succeeded further in presenting India's needs and our duty to India to the extent that she completely wins for 
India's people our affection and love. As a sympathetic treatment of this great people it is unsurpassed by present liter- 
ature upon the subject, and being a keen observer and careful student of the people among whom she has labored long, she 
has new facts to present. This she does in a most interesting and effective manner. 

VILLAGE WORK IN INDIA. By Norman Russell. 

Pen Pictures from a Missionary's Experience. Fully illustrated. 12mo, cloth, $1.25 net. 

A graphic and impressive account of mission work particularly in the villages of India. " From time immemorial," 
says the author, '^ the village has been India's political unit, the oldest of her monuments ; where cities of palaces have 
fallen and crumbled away, the ruined village, phoenix-like, has reared again its mud walls, and presented its red-tiled 
roofs to the sun and rain of heaven." Mr. Russell's splendid descriptive powers bring the landscape and the street, the 
mountain and the plain, with all their beauties and their horrors, into vivid reality. In the awful desolation of heathenism 
we smile at the touches of grim humor and rejoice over the sunny side of Christ's work. Very suggestive as a study in 
methods also, in reaching all sorts and conditions of men. The author's mastery of his subject is everywhere evidenced 
with a rare aptness of diction and vigor of style. 

THE CROSS OF CHRIST IN BOLO=LAND. By John Marvin Dean. 

A Record of Missionary Effort in the Philippines. 12mo, illustrated, decorated cloth, $1.00 nef. 

When the United States came into possession of the Philippines, Christian people said that we ought to go further 
and possess the land for Christ. Mr. Dean went there under the direction of the International Committee of the Young 
Men's Christian Associations. As he combines the rare faculties of seeing and of telling what he has seen, the book has 
not only a missionary interest but a value for its accounts of social and religious conditions, as well as for its fine descrip- 
tions of the physical aspects of the Bolo-Land. It thus appeals to every live American, no matter how weak or how strong 
his missionary sympathies may be. 

EVOLUTION AND MAN. By John Wesley Conley, D.D., 

Author of " Divine Healing and the Doctors," etc. 12mo, cloth, gilt top, 75 cts. net. 

"This book is not an attempt to harmonize science and religion — a work which has been greatly over-done — but 
simply to contribute something, however small, to those phases and currents of thought which are making for unity, and 
which give promise of a better day when truth, scientific and religious, will be one — a day when the true religion will 
dominate science, and the true scientific spirit control religion, and faith in the eternal verities will be girded with a new 
power and go forth to larger conquests." From the preface. 

THE PRINCIPLES OF JESUS. By Robert E. Speer. 

Applied to some Questions of To-day. By author of " The Man Christ Jesus." 16mo, cloth, 75 cts. net. 

It is easy enough for men to agree that Jesus Christ approved only that which is right, and condemned only that which 
is wrone. The real problem lies in the question, What does he approve and what does he condemn in our present d»y 
life? The only way to get at this is to extract the bottom principles from his words and life and then apply them. In 
fifty-four brief studies Mr. Speer gives us not only conclusions but a method and a model for the pursuit ot practical 
moral questions. The book is full of both life and Scripture, and will make a capital text book for Bible classes as well 
as furnishing a stimulant for individual reading.

HISTORIES OF LITERATURE. 



It is something of a paradox that, while lit- 
erature itself is the most interesting product 
of human effort, the histories of literature are 
among the dullest books there are. Why, it 
may reasonably be argued, should not the charm 
of the subject lend itself in some measure to the 
treatment, and why should not books about 
literature have in themselves a literary value? 
Of course, our paradoxical proposition must 
not be taken in too sweeping a sense. When 
a great writer undertakes to deal with literary 
history, the product will be literature as in- 
evitably as if it were a novel or a poem. But 
writers who have the creative endowment are 
almost sure to exercise it upon the material 
shaped by imagination, leaving the material 
of history proper to be the prey of the plodder 
and the pedant. These worthy gentry (perhaps 
from the instinct of self-preservation} do their 
best to keep genius from poaching upon the 
domain of history, and, since genius is more 
frequently shy than aggressive, it is easily 
frightened away. Let a Froude or a Taine 
encamp himself within the sacred precincts of 
historical scholarship, and straightway the 
combined forces of scientific method and dry- 
as-dust investigation are arrayed against the 
unwelcome intruder ; he is given the counsel 
proverbially aimed at over-venturesome cob- 
blers, and is reminded, with pedagogical sever- 
ity, of his notorious delinquencies. 

Thus it is that history falls almost wholly 
into the hands of writers who have the sober 
virtues of industry, and accuracy, and logical 
analysis, while almost wholly lacking the bril- 
liant virtues of style and ideal outlook and 
rich emotional appeal. Even the history of 
literature more frequently than not suffers this 
fate, and is left to be recounted by writers who 
are incapable of making literature on their 
own account. It is, indeed, no easy task to 
make literary history interesting. There are 
too many names to be mentioned, too many 
titles of books to be worked in, too many dry 
facts to be incorporated with the narrative. 
It takes resolution to leave out matters which, 
in the close view, seem essential, and which 
appear unimportant only when the point of 



232 



THE DIAL 



[April 1, 



observation is sufficiently removed to blot out 
all except the salient features of the man or 
the period under discussion. Taine had the 
resolution to do this, and the power to make 
literature out of the treatment of literary his- 
tory ; Symonds had it, and a few others ; Dr. 
Brandes has it in a remarkable degree ; but 
most writers upon the subject are hopelessly 
without it, and, if they seek to be literary at 
all, take refuge in the graceful phrases and 
the vague philosophies of dilettantism. 

There are two devices by which the history 
of literature may be made attractive to a wide 
circle of readers, even when undertaken by an 
uninspired critic. One of them is by the copious 
use of pictorial illustrations of the text. This 
device has long found favor in dealing with 
the history of Continental literatures, but has 
been strangely ignored by English bookmakers. 
There are sumptuously illustrated histories of 
the literatures of Germany, Holland, Denmark, 
Sweden, and Norway, and their example should 
have received imitation long ago by some pub- 
lisher in England or America. We under- 
stand that such a work is at last to be brought 
out in England, under the editorship of Mr. 
Gosse, and we shall await its appearance with 
much interest. The other device is that of 
frankly making the history a collection of rep- 
resentative extracts, with just enough of nar- 
rative and critical discussion to provide a 
connecting medium. Such a history is sug- 
gestive of a plum-pudding, and consists mostly 
of plums, the matrix in which they are im- 
bedded having little distinctive taste of its own. 
The most prosaic of writers, if only he have a 
pretty taste in reading, can make an attractive 
book of this type, and such books are well 
worth making, if for no other reason than that 
they stimulate their readers to further investi- 
gation in the right direction. 

We have been led to make the foregoing 
remarks by the reappearance, in twentieth cen- 
tury guise, of " Chambers's Cyclopaedia of En- 
glish Literature." The good old book which 
has borne that name for sixty years has had a 
useful career. It began to appear in 1842, 
was revised and brought down to date in 1858, 
was again revised and extended in 1876, and 
still again in 1888. The present form is there- 
fore the fourth of its reincarnations, and is 
almost as unlike the first edition as the latest 
form of " Webster's Dictionary " is unlike the 
earlier ones. There are to be three volumes 
in place of the traditional two, and huge vol- 
umes they will be, if we may judge by the one 



already issued by the Messrs. Lippincott, for 
it fills no less than eight hundred and thirty- 
two double-columned pages. Dr. David Patrick 
is the editor of this reissued and practically 
remoulded work, and he has profited by the 
collaboration of a number of the most eminent 
English scholars. 

The objects of the undertaking, as set forth 
by the present editor, have been as follows. 
The work " is not, and is not meant to be, an 
anthology of the perfect models of our prose 
and verse, a chrestomathy of purple patches^ 
a collection of elegant extracts. The acknowl- 
edged gem should be there, if a man is mainly 
known by some one noble passage, one sonnet, 
one song, one aphorism or sententious saying ; 
but something there should be, as a rule, to 
illustrate his average achievement, the standard 
by which he may fairly be judged. Nor doea 
the work profess to be a marrow of our liter- 
ature, or to give the spirit and quintessence of 
the several authors ; still less does it aim to 
render its readers independent of the authors 
themselves or relieve them from the duty and 
pleasure of studying the original works. In 
no case will one rise from articles of ours flat- 
tering himself that now he knows his author 
and may consider that subject settled." With 
these objects in view, the selection of passages 
seems to us highly judicious, and we are glad 
to note that, in addition to portrait illustrations, 
a few facsimiles of famous manuscripts have 
been inserted. 

In point of scholarship, the new " Chambers '* 
leaves little to be desired. It has taken account 
of the latest work of English and American 
students ; it has multiplied the space formerly 
devoted to Old and Middle English, and this 
first volume alone gives treatment to over fifty 
authors barely mentioned before, if at all. The 
signed special contributions are so important 
that they must be mentioned. The Rev. Stop- 
ford Brooke has written of Old English liter- 
ature. Mr. Alfred W. Pollard has dealt with the 
Middle Period, with Chaucer, Caxton, and the 
English Bible. Spenser and Shakespeare have 
fallen, respectively, into the hands of Mr. Ed- 
mund Gosse and Mr. Sidney Lee. Mr. Andrew 
Lang has written of the Ballads, the late S. R. 
Gardiner of the Civil War and the Common- 
wealth, Mr. A. H. Bullen of the Restoration, 
and Mr. Saintsbury of Dryden. The bulk of 
the work, of course, has been done by Mr. 
Patrick's editorial staff, and a special tribute 
is paid to " the accurate scholarship, the keen 
insight, the incisive style " of the late Francis

Hindes Groome, who had an important share 
in the work. 

The first volume ends with the seventeenth 
century. The two remaining centuries will fill 
the other two volumes, and we learn with satis- 
faction that eminent living authors will be in- 
cluded. Nor will America be neglected, for 
the worthies of our own literature will take 
their proper places in the chronological ar- 
rangement, and will, generally speaking, be 
discussed by American critics. This is as it 
should be, and we may close this article by an 
appropriate quotation from the general preface 
to the work. " As the English tradition has 
remained dominant in the Constitution of the 
nation and the life of the people, our kindred 
both by lineage and language, so American 
literature has remained an offshoot, a true 
branch of English literature. In this work it 
has from the beginning been treated as an 
integral and important part of the literature 
of Great Britain. We do not look on Long- 
fellow or Poe as foreigners, or read the his- 
tories of Prescott, Motley, and Parkman as if 
written by strangers." 



ON THE LITERARY DECLINE OF 
HISTORY. 



Not many months ago the writer had occasion to 
read a book-review, the chief burden of which was 
a rather naively-expressed lament concerning the 
alleged decline of historical writing as literature in 
these latter days. The very interesting question, 
though hardly a new one, was raised as to why we 
have no contemporary Herodotus, Tacitus, Gibbon, 
or Hallam, — why there is now no Macaulay to 
write history in a manner so fascinating as to crowd 
the latest novel off my lady's table. A complete 
answer, even were it possible, would involve a mul- 
titude of considerations, and would far transcend 
the limits of space at our present disposal ; but it 
may not be profitless to venture a few suggestions. 

That there has been a decline in historical writ- 
ing, as judged by the canons of great literature, 
some might possibly deny, but the most of us would 
readily concede. One has but to mention Herod- 
otus, Thucydides, and Tacitus, among the ancients, 
Cailyle, Macaulay, Gibbon, and Green, in days 
nearer our own, to bring to mind some of the 
world's greatest masterpieces of prose writing. 
With these, the works of history produced during 
the last quarter-century, while almost legion in 
number, are in but very few cases even comparable 
as pieces of literary art. They may be, and without 
doubt frequently are, better histories, but they are 
certainly not so good literature. 



The truth is that the spirit of modern historical 
writing is very different from that which animated 
the historian of former ages. This change has re- 
sulted from the rise of the so-called " scientific " 
school of historical students and writers ; and for 
the rise of this school the doctrine of evolution 
must be given the ultimate credit. Evolution is 
essentially a method of thought and interpretation, 
and as such has worked a reconstruction, not merely 
in biological science, but also in literature, philoso- 
phy, theology, and history. In these latter fields 
we are not always consciously aware that it is evo- 
lution that controls. But we have breathed the 
evolution spirit until it has come to give color to all 
our thought, and we find ourselves speaking con- 
tinually in its terms, though we might well be at a 
loss to tell where we learned them. The great con- 
tribution of the doctrine of evolution in every sphere 
of knowledge which it has touched has been the 
establishment of principles of relationship and con- 
tinuity. So that just as under its influence we no 
longer think of geological changes under the time- 
honored cataclysmic concept, according to which 
each new epoch was supposed to be wholly unrelated 
to the one foregoing, so we no longer, at least when 
at our best, think of historical " ages " as isolated 
from one another and of human life thus broken 
apart. And just as evolution has taught the geologist 
that if he is really to know his subject he must use 
materials — rocks and fossils and soils — at first 
hand, and likewise the chemist his test-tubes and 
reagents, the botanist his plants, and the zoologist 
his animals, so has it also taught the historian that 
if he would know the men of any age or country he 
must not neglect to seek out and study diligently 
everything they have left behind them. He must 
go back to the sources — back to dusty manuscripts, 
sculptured columns, long-buried coins and imple- 
ments. In other words, he must follow the evolu- 
tionary method of science. 

Hence comes the " scientific school " of historians, 
most eminently represented, amongEnglish-speaking 
peoples at least, by Bishop Stubbs and Samuel 
Rawson Gardiner. The writings of these men easily 
betray the fact that scholarship, and not literary art, 
has been the primary consideration. Their lan- 
guage is cold, careful, and concise, scrupulously 
devoid of rhetorical devices, and hardly calculated 
to charm the general reader. And not only has 
our best historical writing become less " literary," 
but the so-called literary historians, especially Car- 
lyle, Macaulay, and Gibbon, have been brought 
into considerable discredit by the modern school. 
We may still read these authors, but we are assured 
that the history which we get from them will be 
very distorted and inadequate unless corrected by 
an acquaintance with the works of those who have 
written less brilliantly but more truthfully. 

The former historian generally undertook to cover 
a larger field than the modern. A history was 
deemed of small note unless it presented the im- 



234 



THE DIAL 



[April 1, 



posing appearance of six, eight, or even a dozen, 
goodly volumes, and measured off its subject-matter 
in terms of milleniums. To-day the spectacle of a 
really great historical scholar sitting down to write 
the entire history of a great people or nation — 
much less of civilization in general — is virtually 
unknown. Except in the case of historical smat- 
terers who make up in verbosity what they lack in 
scholarship, there are practically no more attempts 
at historical writing on so ambitious a scale. The 
writing of history has come to involve such labor in 
research and such painstaking effort in verification, 
that, if properly done, the limitations of life pre- 
clude the exploitation by any one student of more 
than a contracted period in the life of a single 
people ; so that Freeman spends two decades upon 
the one subject of the Norman Conquest, Gardiner 
labors half a life-time upon the Civil War and the 
Commonwealth, covering fewer years in the history 
of England than are consumed by the work in his 
own life, Parkman gives his life to the study of the 
French settlements in America, Mr. Henry Adams 
concentrates his masterly energies upon the admin- 
istrations of Jefferson and Madison, and Mr. James 
F. Rhodes will have to live many years yet in order 
to complete his history of the United States from 
the Compromise of 1850 to the first administration 
of Grover Cleveland. 

This ideal of thoroughness permeates all our 
historical work. Not only are the more renowned 
writers controlled by it, but the historical instruc- 
tion and investigation in our best colleges and 
universities testify to its force. The key-note of 
graduate instruction is concentration, the mastery 
in detail of a limited field, the adding of something, 
if possible, to the already existing knowledge on 
the subject investigated. And the sort of work 
which is required of candidates for the doctorate in 
history is the sort of work which, with few excep- 
tions, these men will continue to do throughout the 
remainder of their scholastic careers. 

Now this sort of work, while a distinct gain for 
historical scholarship, is not conducive to the de- 
velopment of a fine literary style. The form of 
expression is made entirely subordinate to the sub- 
ject-matter. While no one would dispute that the 
essential qualities of good prose literature — clear- 
ness, precision, and force — are eminently desir- 
able in historical as well as any other kind of 
composition, yet the conscientious historian is so 
persistently on guard against sweeping generaliza- 
tions, unwarranted parallels, and other earmarks of 
" fine writing," that he stands in immediate danger 
of acting on the principle, if not openly admitting 
it, that dulness and roughness are virtues in his 
writing, and all well-sounding phrases and nicely- 
rounded periods are necessarily snares set by some 
evil genius to compass his destruction. 

History must be written to-day with the strictest 
regard for truth, and truth in the minutest detail. 
A thing is to be valued in proportion as it can be 



absolutely verified. The task of the historian, and 
the weight of responsibility that devolves upon him, 
has become such that, as Professor Woodrow Wilson 
facetiously remarks, it is a wonder that the histo- 
rians who take their business seriously can sleep at 
night. We now demand actually to see history in 
the process of being written. We must have 
plainly indicated every step which the author has 
taken in the accomplishment of his work. We are 
no longer at all content to accept his conclusions 
without at least seeing his method of approach 
to them. The writing of history is thus coming to 
be more and more a matter of arranging foot-notes 
and cross-references. 

Literature knows no such demand of verifica- 
tion, at least of this comparatively petty sort, and 
employs no such stiff and constraining devices. 
The fundamental prerequisite of all genuine litera- 
ture is that it be entirely loyal to the truth, — but 
truth in the universal, the general, not in the spe- 
cific. Literature exhibits a luxurious carelessness 
of details which the historian can by no means 
afford to indulge. Imagine the author of the 
" Iliad " (be he one or many) citing authorities for 
his genealogies, his battle-scenes and army-rolls 1 
Or Shakespeare detailing in foot-notes the sources 
from which he drew the character of Shylock, the 
plot of Macbeth, or the story of Antony and Cleo- 
patra, and referring to parallel passages in Greene 
and Marlowe and Kyd ! Or Wordsworth gravely 
appending to the " Intimations of Immortality " a 
treatise setting forth the most recent results of 
speculative thought on the probabilities of the 
future life! Yet just such things — such petty in- 
consequential things, the litterateur would say — 
the historian finds himself more and more under 
the necessity of doing. 

All this results from the fact that while litera- 
ture is primarily a matter of feeling, history is pri- 
marily a matter of knowledge. There is feeling in 
history and knowledge in literature, but the domi- 
nant elements are the other way. Literature, 
being of the heart as well as of the head, is to be 
tested by canons of sentiment as well as of fact. 
The question is not, is this statement literally true? 
or, is this name entirely authentic? or, is this 
euphonious allusion restrained within the bounds 
of cold verity? Such considerations are really of 
slight moment. What matters vastly more is 
whether the given production exhibits the larger 
and finer qualities of simplicity, beauty, and uni- 
versality of interest and appeal. But with history 
it is not so ; neither indeed can it be. These ques- 
tions of exact authenticity and scrupulous fidelity 
to fact, while sometimes very annoying when per- 
sistently thrust at a piece of fine writing like 
Macaulay's third chapter, are perfectly legitimate ; 
and if they cannot be satisfactorily answered, the 
value of the work is irretrievably diminished. Of 
course it is quite possible for all these demands to 
be faultlessly complied with, and the production

still fall far short of being good history. It may 
be only a dull and unprofitable chronicle. It may 
be wholly lacking in the virile qualities that are 
indispensable to the vivifying of historical truth. 
History, to be worthy of the name, must not merely 
be accurate in details, but must also be trustworthy 
in interpretation of those details. When the his- 
torian has made sure of his facts his work has only 
been begun. The essential must be sifted from 
the non-essential. Motives and influences must be 
detected, weighed, and adjudged. Light must be 
sought from the sciences tributary to history — 
archaeology, philology, geography, and the like, — 
and, being found, must be judicially applied to the 
subject in hand. The history of a year or an 
epoch, of a movement or an institution, must be 
given its proper setting in the Weltgeschichte. 
Failure in these larger requirements would sacrifice 
at the outset any claim which an historical produc- 
tion might have to scholarly recognition. 

And besides all this, after the historian has fash- 
ioned his product with the extremest care and 
deliberation, he may be sure that, however great its 
merits, it will not long continue to maintain its 
place in the favor either of scholars or of the world 
at large. For, on the one hand, new discoveries, 
new ideas, new interpretations, will inevitably dis- 
credit more or less of what has been said ; and, on 
the other, changed tastes and fluctuating interests 
will demand a re-writing of the old material. Ex- 
cept in cases where it has been the fortune of the 
historian to become our only medium of knowledge 
of an age or historical process, there is no such 
thing as finality in the writing of history. In the 
words of a recent writer on this subject, " Each 
generation must write its own history of past events 
in order to interpret them in terms corresponding 
to its needs. New conditions give rise to new 
problems, and these to new conceptions ; and when 
we turn again to examine the past, we put to it 
questions never before asked." 

Just now we are in the age of extreme particu- 
larism in historical research and writing. In our 
study we are following the method of the anatomist 
rather than that of the artist. We are bent upon 
details rather than upon the general effect — dis- 
secting rather than studying in perspective. We 
are curbing our ambitions and recognizing our 
limitations as never before. We are working under 
the conviction that a life-time is none too long 
a time to give to any one of hundreds of brief 
periods or single phases of the historical field. 
Historical truth is being accumulated and put in 
imperishable form with unparalleled rapidity and 
discernment. We are too busy collecting the ma- 
terials for the mosaic, to give much thought to the 
mosaic itself. We are too busy and too " scien- 
tific " to give much thought to the literary quality 
of the history that we write. 

When all has been said, however, the fact re- 
mains that history and literature are bound together 



by ties impossible to be broken. Both are concerned 
primarily with the phenomena of human life, either 
as it has been or as it might be. The mere con- 
sideration that history deals with this subject on 
the fact side, and literature on the imaginative 
side, is not sufficient to set up an impassable 
barrier between the two. Literature continues 
to be the greatest of all sources of historical 
knowledge, and history the only adequate basis 
for the understanding and appreciation of litera- 
ture. When the great fund of historical knowl- 
edge shall have been more fully brought to light, 
there will be no inherent reason why historical 
writing may not take on all the essential qualities 
of great prose literature ; for it is to be believed 
that truth is indeed stranger than fiction, and that 
the illuminating recital of what men have been and 
what they have done and what they have tried to 
do can never be greatly surpassed for interest and 
force by anything that it can enter into the imagi- 
nation of man to conceive. 

The portrayal of human life, which is the ulti- 
mate business of the historian, can never be made 
a mere matter of black-and-white sketching. So 
subtle is life in its ramifications, so intricate in its 
relationships, so variegated in its meanings and 
influences, that nothing short of consummate liter- 
ary skill can adequately present the shades and 
colors of the picture. There is a dead mechanical 
way of writing history, which as a temporary ex- 
pedient is all well enough, but there is also a 
living, artistic, forceful way, which must be taken 
advantage of when the time becomes ripe for it. 
Our need for literary art in the collection and 
classification of materials is slight ; but not so when 
the materials thus gathered are to be given a sane, 
comprehensive, and illuminating interpretation. 

Some day there will set in a movement to coor- 
dinate the results of our specialized effort, and then 
may be expected to appear once more the literary 
historian. Scholarship will not be less valued, nor 
truth less highly regarded ; but the art of present- 
ing truth will be given more attention. Noth- 
ing short of a transcendent genius, however, can 
ever again fill the place of the genuine literary 
historian. From our conscientious devotion to 
truth in the minute we shall never wholly recover ; 
and of all historical writing we shall continue to 
demand absolute accuracy of detail, — a standard 
which was unknown to Herodotus, Livy, Carlyle, 
and Macaulay. Thus the necessities which the 
literary historian of the future will have to meet 
grow greater with every passing day.

PHONETICS AND SPELLING REFORM. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

Little attention has been given to the effect that a 
study of the modern science of phonetics has had upon 
the agitation for spelling reform, so called ; yet, prop- 
erly understood, almost the entire case of the reformers 
seems to be put out of court by the results of the recent 
labors of phoneticians like Mr, Henry Sweet and Mr. 
Alexander Melville Bell. 

Striking at the very root of the matter is the dis- 
closure that, the principal advocates of spelling reform 
being philologists, it is not they, but the phoneticians, 
who are specialists in the premises sought to be occu- 
pied; and, not being specialists, the philologists who 
are chiefly responsible for such contrivances as the 
" scientific alphabet " of the American Philological As- 
sociation are, partially at least, outside of this particular 
province of learning. Just what this signifies will be 
taken up in more detail directly. 

The publication of the " Oxford " dictionary discloses 
certain growing tendencies on the part of both American 
and British speech to vary from a common standard of 
English. Comparing the " scientific alphabet " referred 
to above with the " Key to the Pronunciation " in Dr. 
Murray's and Mr. Henry Bradley's great word-book, 
the differences are remarkable in several cases. The 
alphabet gives the sound of a in care and tare as the 
long sound of the a in fat and fan; the key gives the 
vowel sound in there and pare as the long sound of the 
vowel in yet and ten. The alphabet gives the name 
sound of i as compounded of the a in ask and the i in 
it) the key, as made up of the obscure sound heard in 
the last syllable of ever and nation and the t in sit. The 
alphabet gives Tiurt and hurst as exemplifying the long 
sound of the u heard in hut and tub; this the key con- 
cedes to the sound heard in curl and fur^ but marks the 
vowel in fir, fern, and earth as the long sound of the 
obscure vowel in the last syllable of ever and nation. 
The alphabet notes the o in note as the long sound of 
the in obey; the key differentiates the o in hero from 
the sound heard in so and soul by affixing to the former 
a vanish sound resembling that of the u mfull. The 
alphabet gives the diphthong oi as composed of the o 
sound heard in on and not and the i sound in it and in; 
the key compounds it of the o sound heard in the last 
syllable of achor or the first syllable of morality and 
of the i in sit. There are other differences, due, how- 
ever, for the most part to the fact that the key dis- 
criminates more largely than the alphabet: I have lim- 
ited comparisons here to the cases in which the alphabet 
provides characters for markings identical with those 
of the key and arrives at a disagreement; though I 
find I have omitted the long sound of the e in met and 
fen in the alphabet as exemplified by the vowel in they 
and dey; while the key marks the sound in they as made 
up of the vowel heard in the last syllable of the noun 
survey and the i in it. In all cases in which a final r 
follows a long vowel sound, the key adds the obscure 
sound heard in the last syllable of ever to the initial 
character of the vowel, which the alphabet does 
not do. 

It is evident that there are differences of a vital 
character between the two schemes of pronunciation. 
In some cases, notably in that of the long i sound, these 



are due to real differences between the language as 
spoken in England and in the United States. This 
may also be true of the sound in care and pare. Those 
of us who were taught to discriminate between the 
sound heard in there and air and that in their and heir 
will learn with some curiosity that neither in England 
nor the United States is there dictionary authority for 
such discrimination, the British giving them all the 
sound heard in the latter pair and the Americans that 
heard in the former. But the American Philological 
Association and the phoneticians of the " Oxford " 
dictionary do not agree, it has been shown, about the 
sound of long o, of long i, and of the diphthong oi, and 
are in disagreement regarding all long vowel sounds 
followed by final r, — and there are numerous slighter 
divergences. 

If an appeal be now taken to Messrs. Sweet and 
Bell — with whom Dr. Skeat may be named — this con- 
fusion will be found to be worse confounded. With them 
the name sound of e is made up of the i in it and a con- 
sonantal y, and the long oo sound heard in food of the 
short 00 sound in foot and a consonantal w. With them 
the final r sound disappears except when carried as an 
initial r to a succeeding word beginning with a vowel, 
though in every case modifying a preceding long vowel 
by what is called a " vocal murmur." Though it is not 
expressly noted, the present tendency is to make im- 
proper diphthongs of almost all the long vowel sounds 
in English with the exception of the two sounds of a 
heard in ah and awe, by the addition of either conso- 
nantal w or y. Thus the name sounds of a, e, and t, 
and of the diphthong oi end with y; and the name 
sounds of and u, of the long oo, and of the diphthong 
ou as in foul, with to. The " Century " dictionary does 
not mark a y sound in mayor, seer, buyer, or boyar, nor 
a w sound in sower, wooer, bower, or ewer, though author- 
izing the pronunciation of every one of these words as 
a dissyllable. Yet it is present, and, it may be added, 
the discriminating ear can also detect a y sound in fear 
and fire, and a w sound in sore, poor, your, and flour. 
The differences are slight — and seem to be growing 
slighter — between the pronunciation of such words as 
cere and seer, byre and buyer, sore and sower, flour and 
flower, and your and ewer; in poetry all are used as 
monosyllables or dissyllables indifferently, unless, as in 
Tennyson's case, the speech has a flavor of North 
British, where the final r sound is insisted upon. 

All these failures of accordance between those who 
have become specialists in phonetics, like the phone- 
ticians, or dabblers in phonetics, like the philologists, 
point out more clearly than mere words the important 
fact that English is a living language and that its sounds, 
particularly its vowel sounds, are always in a state of 
transition. Those not definitively committed to some 
form of "spelling reform " will probably agree that the 
very fact that our spelling bears no real relation to our 
spoken language has left our mother tongue the freer 
to develop itself along the lines of least resistance, and 
that any attempt to crystallize our speech in the written 
language would have a disastrous effect upon the evo- 
lution now going steadily on, — vide the concluding 
chapter of Mr. Sweet's " History of English Sounds " 
for a discussion of existing tendencies toward further 
and more radical changes. 

But these same changes have another significance in 
pointing out differences which already exist — as in the 
case of the name sound of i already referred to — be-

tween British speech and American speech. Any at- 
tempt at spelling reform which does not recognize such 
differences is essentially faulty, for it seems to be con- 
ceded by all that there is no logical nor scientific abiding 
place between spelling as we do now, and spelling as 
we pronounce. If we retain our ancient and unscientific 
orthography, there is certainly no danger of the great 
branches of the English-speaking race becoming mutu- 
ally unintelligible; whatever our divergences, even if 
they should reach forward to a time when a cultivated 
Englishman and a cultivated American could not un- 
derstand one another's conversation, we should still be 
able to communicate in writing, after the manner of the 
Chinese and Japanese. This fear of unintelligibility 
becomes more and more remote, of course, with every 
step in science and diplomacy which links the two na- 
tions together. 

There are no statistics that I have been able to dis- 
cover which show the proportion of written words in 
English to words spoken. Even in a country like the 
United States, where so many men and women spend 
much of their time in reading newspapers as well as 
magazines and books, it must still be evident that spoken 
words vastly outnumber written words or words read. 
Ten minutes' conversation reported verbatim occupies 
more than a newspaper column when reduced to print; 
fifty newspaper columns contain as much reading matter 
as the average novel. By as much as the spoken words 
exceed in number the words written and read, by so 
much is the spoken language more important than the 
written, as a matter of axiom. The future expansion 
of English, indeed, may be said to depend almost wholly 
upon speech as against writing or reading. Anything 
which seeks to prevent the normal growth of the spoken 
language, therefore, whether by crystallizing speech 
into phonetic signs like those recommended by spelling 
" reformers " or in some other manner, must operate 
against the best interests of the race, and in operating 
against them against the best interests of our literature.

JAPANESE LITERARY TASTE. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

The leading firm of booksellers in Japan recently 
asked a large number of eminent Japanese men of let- 
ters, of science, of business, etc., to name their favorite 
European or American books. The seventy-three 
answers received have been published in a local per- 
iodical, and are interesting as displaying the literary 
tastes of Japanese readers of foreign literature. 

The most popular work is Darwin's " Origin of Spe- 
cies," which received twenty-six votes ; next comes 
Goethe's " Faust," the « Encyclopaedia Brittanica," and 
Hugo's " Les Miserables," in the order named. Among 
English men of letters, Byron and Tennyson are the 
most popular. The names of Stevenson, Hardy, Mere- 
dith, "Mark Twain," and other recent writers are 
rarely met with, while that of Kipling occurs not even 
once. Among continental writers, Tolstoi, Schopen- 
hauer, Heine, and Zola are frequently mentioned ; and 
Nietsche's " Zarathustra " is characterized more than 
once as the greatest work in the last decade of the nine- 
teenth century.

William Hamilton Gibson.* 

In reading of the life of William Hamilton 
Gibson, " Artist, Naturalist, Author," one is 
irresistibly reminded of the well-loved lines from 
"Thanatopsis": 

" To him who in the love of nature holds 
Communion with her visible forniB, she speaks 
A various language." 

To few indeed has it been granted to interpret 
that language so variously. That deep, strong, 
persistent note that Thoreau sounded was fol- 
lowed later in the century by Gibson, not be- 
cause Thoreau was his master, but because for 
him too the call was imperative ; and what he 
saw he told by voice and pen, pencil and brush, 
until his originality, his versatility, his buoyant 
life, brought him friends and followers every- 
where. 

The book on Gibson by Mr. John Coleman 
Adams is not a dry record of facts, but rather 
a eulogy, — a eulogy in a good cause, however, 
for one fancies that the book has been written 
not more to picture this most interesting life 
than to arouse fresh enthusiasm for those 
studies of which the author is himself an ex- 
ponent. Gibson may have had faults, but Mr. 
Adams does not mention them. Bather, he 
draws a loving and intensely enthusiastic pic- 
ture of the artist, naturalist, and writer, later 
filling in the outlines by means of letters, the 
reminiscences of friends, and various incidents. 
We can read also the series of portraits, from 
childhood to manhood, which show from first 
to last a countenance singularly open, with 
clear, bright eyes, slightly full, curved lips, the 
entire face lit with intelligence and animation, 
and wholly lovable. 

The first three chapters, comprising less than 
a third of the book, are given to an outline of 
Gibson's life. We learn that he was born at 
Sandy Hook, Newtown, Connecticut, October 6, 
1850. Mr. Adams has called his first chapter 
" A Fortunate Boyhood." The title is justified, 
for Gibson had a mother who, besides being 
intelligent and well-educated, was loving and 
sympathetic, and helped him in his childish 
nature studies, — even to the extent of giving 
him a drawer in her linen-press for his worms I 
We do not learn much of Gibson's father, who, 
while still retaining his summer home at New-

town, made his later home in Brooklyn, where 
Gibson had Henry Ward Beecher for pastor 
and friend. But we can infer that the father 
was a man of business, more occupied with his 
office than with his children, since there is a 
scathing letter from Gibson's schoolmaster 
suggesting that the father require one of the 
clerks to write to his homesick boy once or 
twice a quarter. It was this schoolmaster, 
Mr. Gunn, who presided over the other portion 
of Gibson's " fortunate boyhood." At the 
" Gunnery," in Washington, Connecticut, the 
boy spent several happy years, which always 
loomed large in his memory, and to these he 
attributed much of his success in later life. 
The account of these school-days is most inter- 
esting, including several delightful letters to 
the boy's mother. We learn that while " Willie " 
was " a dear little fellow," bright and obedient, 
it somewhat troubled Mr. Gunn that he had 
not" learned to be spontaneously industrious." 
Later, however, when attending the Polytech- 
nic, this trait of indolence disappeared ; and 
thereafter, even to the end, he worked with 
consuming energy. 

In 1868 Gibson's father died, apparently 
leaving no fortune ; and Gibson took up life- 
insurance as a means of support. This lasted 
but a short time, however, for, seeing a draughts- 
man drawing upon the block, Gibson decided 
that he could do it also ; and thereupon began 
the struggle that was to result in his unique 
position as artist-naturalist. He had tried to 
draw, from his earliest childhood, but had been 
discouraged in it, as so many others have been. 
He had no training, no art-education of any 
kind. But his labor and perseverance, added 
to his inborn genius, overcame all difficulties, 
and before long he made a modest beginning 
by illustrating " The Chimney Corner " and 
" The Boys' and Girls' Weekly," and a little 
later he made botanical drawings for " The 
American Agriculturalist " and " Appletons' 
Encyclopedia." In 1872 came his first large 
commission, a set of twelve drawings on stone 
for the Appletons' huge botanical charts. This 
work was done with remarkable rapidity, and 
brought him nearly a thousand dollars ; and 
from now on his path was clear. 

About this time Gibson made his first orig- 
inal composition, and soon thereafter received 
a commission from the Appletons to make a 
sketching tour into Rhode Island, to obtain 
illustrations for " Picturesque America." He 
afterwards made other sketching trips : to 
Washington, D. C. (1874), to Philadelphia 



(1876), to the White Mountains (1880 and 
1883), to the South (1886), and to Europe 
(1888). 

The year 1878, we are told, marks an epoch 
not only in Gibson's life, but in American 
illustration. It was in that year that he fur- 
nished designs for an article by Mrs. Helen 
S. Conant on " Birds and Plumage," in 
" Harper's Magazine." These illustrations in- 
cluded a full-page picture of a peacock's feather, 
which was so striking that it attracted much 
attention from both laymen and artists. 

Although Gibson wrote in 1876 " The Com- 
plete American Trapper," a book for boys, his 
real literary work began in 1879 with the first 
of the articles that were afterwards collected 
Pastoral Days." This article was an ac- 



as 



count, in writing and sketches, of a summer 
vacation at his old homes in Connecticut. He 
was now fairly launched in the career that he 
followed for the rest of his too- short life, and, 
considering all the other work he kept going 
at the same time, his books followed one an- 
other in quick succession. " Highways and 
Byways," extended from a series of magazine 
articles, appeared in 1882, and " Happy Hunt- 
ing Grounds" in 1886. These were both re- 
ceived with favor and even enthusiasm. Mean- 
while, the author had been providing the 
illustrations for E. P. Roe's " Success with 
Small Fruits " and " Nature's Serial Story "; 
" In Berkshire with the Wild Flowers," by the 
Goodale sisters ; Drake's " Heart of the White 
Mountains "; " The Master of the Gunnery," 
a memorial of his old teacher ; " Sketches in 
the South," by Charles Dudley Warner and 
Rebecca Harding Davis ; and for many mis- 
cellaneous articles. 

During these years, also, Gibson had been 
enlarging his field by working in water-colors, 
which remained to the last a favorite medium 
with him, and had made some attempts in oils. 
He had long since made a name for himself, 
and for everything that he did, writing, sketch- 
ing, or painting, there was a ready welcome. 
He had opened many unseeing eyes, led thou- 
sands into new paths, and in short performed 
the part of a new kind of missionary both in 
this country and abroad. His remaining ten 
years saw the publication of five more books, — 
" Strolls by Starlight and Sunshine," " Sharp 
Eyes" (his most popular work), " Our Edible 
Mushrooms and Toadstools," " Eye Spy," and 
" My Studio Neighbors "; and he left a quantity 
of material, in notes and sketches, for an illus- 
trated botany and other works. During his 



1902.] 



THE DIAL

last few years also he had a new interest, in 
the form of popular lectures on botany, for 
which he made curious charts and diagrams. 
In 1896, after several months' failing health, 
he died at his old home in Washington, Con- 
necticut. 

Such, in brief, are the outlines of Gibson's 
life, — an uneventful life in one sense, but in 
another crowded to overflowing ; a life best 
shown in its results. His marvellous capacity 
for work was one of Gibson's most character- 
istic traits, and in it lies the secret not only of 
his success, but of his early death. In Mr. 
Adams's words, " The fierce fires of a relentless 
industry had burned his forces to a cinder." 

It is chiefly as artist and author that Gibson 
appears in the foregoing sketch, but these two 
involved his other side. For in everything 
that he did, writing or picturing, he was inter- 
preting nature. Nature-lover he was always, 
from his earliest childhood ; and by faithful, 
loving observation and investigation he became 
a naturalist as well. Nature in all her mani- 
festations was a constant passion with him ; 
but it was through making known to multi- 
tudes the secrets of growing things that he will 
be longest remembered. 

The second part of Mr. Adams's book deals 
with Gibson's work and his methods of working 
in his different mediums, and with " the per- 
sonal side." The final chapter, together with an 
account of his death and funeral services, con- 
tains the reminiscences of friends and eulogistic 
tributes. Emerson's words, " Do that which is 
assigned to you, and you cannot hope or dare too 
much," might have been Gibson's motto. Brave, 
self-confident, but not overbearing, full of life 
and joy and wholesome fun, he carried out the 
promise of his bright and lovable boyhood, and 
lives in the memory of all who knew him, not 
only as genius, but as man. 

Gibson might have found a biographer who 
gave more attention to detail, if a formal biog- 
raphy were wanted, but he could not have 
found a more enthusiastic one. There are 
many things an inquirer could ask and not find 
answered in this book, but we learn all that is 
needful to enable us to account for the man 
and his work. The arrangement of the book 
gives rise to some repetition, and in one case 
the different accounts do not exactly agree : 
*. e., the accounts of the inception of "Sharp 
Eyes " as given on pages 72 and 173. There 
are occasional slips of statement or arrange- 
ment, as on page 210, where Mr. Adams says, 
" Near the close of the same year," etc. Re- 



ferring to the previous letters we find them 
dated successively 1863, 1864, 1864, 1865, 
while the two letters following the above state- 
ment are dated 1863. There is no great pre- 
tension to literary style, but we get that vivid 
impression that is given when an author's heart 
is in his work. The book is attractively pre- 
sented, and contains, besides the portraits al- 
ready mentioned, and views of Gibson's homes 
and haunts and his grave, a considerable num- 
ber of reproductions of his works.

liEADERS OF VICTORIAN IiITEKATURE.* 



It requires courage and confidence in a critic 
to sit down to-day and write about such old- 
fashioned matters as Thackeray's novels and 
George Eliot's, instead of dropping sparkling 
utterances on such up-to-date and modern topics 
as, for instance, " Recent Phases of Romantic 
Fiction " or " Exotic Tendencies in Present- 
day Dilettantism." A bright screed prophe- 
sying a Bulwer Revival or an eighteenth cen- 
tury Renaissance might do, if one insisted on 
dealing with old-time topics ; but an effort to 
arrive at a sound estimate of Carlyle or Mat- 
thew Arnold seems hardly in keeping with the 
present tendencies of current criticism, at least 
so far as it is observable in our critical jour- 
nalism. Mr. Brownell doubtless has the quali- 
ties mentioned above to some extent, for he 
presents us with six essays on what might be 
called classic subjects ; he gives us estimates 
of Thackeray, Carlyle, George Eliot, Matthew 
Arnold, Ruskin, and Meredith, which have 
little connection with an interest in Gorky, 
Maeterlinck, Maurice Hewlett, and the Ro- 
mance of American History. 

This is much in Mr. Brownell's favor. His 
work is not designed for the moment only ; he 
considers fundamental questions (we might 
almost say) in estimating literature ; he sets 
himself at some of the great problems of liter- 
ature. He could hardly attempt anything more 
solid if he published an estimate of Macaulay 
in the " Quarterly Review," and perhaps would 
not do so much even then. 

Mr. Brownell, then, has set himself to a 
piece of work that was well worth while, an 
attempt to form an estimate of the most con- 
siderable prose writers of our literature, in the 
period just before our own. This is the proper

occupation for a critic of the first order. Such 
a critic will consider the greatest names of all 
time, he will have his opinions also upon the 
work of his own day ; but he is most usefully 
employed when he deals with the generation 
which has just preceded .him, when he tries to 
put general opinion, released from the prejudices 
of the present, on the way to a judgment that 
shall last. There is often a period of relaxa- 
tion in our interest in the great figures of liter- 
ature who have just passed away. They achieve 
fame in life, let us say, they are an influence, 
perhaps, for the decade after their death. But 
then, before they take a definite place as clas- 
sics, there comes a period in which people are 
not much interested in them. Sometimes this 
period comes even before their death, as was 
the case with Wordsworth, who in his later 
years was by no means the figure in the minds 
of those who loved poetry that he became after- 
ward. Sometimes it comes very soon after 
death, as was the case with Dickens, who, 
people think, is now ripe for a " revival." But 
it generally comes some time. 

Mr. Brownell practically notes this fact in 
regard to some of those of whom he writes. 
" Carlyle's own writings," he says, " fell speed- 
ily into a neglect," etc.; " How long is it since 
George Eliot's name has been the subject of 
even a literary allusion ? "; " No writer, prob- 
ably, ever passed so quickly [as Matthew Ar- 
nold] from unpopularity through fame to 
comparative neglect." Three of Kuskin's books 
" probably comprise all of his product that will 
last through the epoch of indifference to much 
that the present age has delighted in, which 
we can readily perceive to be upon us." Thack- 
eray, it is to be remarked, achieved a fame 
which has steadily increased, George Meredith 
was received with a neglect which is but slowly 
diminishing. 

What will a critic say of such writers, or 
rather of writers at such a centre of indiffer- 
ence? He has a responsible position, for if he be 
really a critic of influence he will have no small 
part in pronouncing the everlasting yea or the 
everlasting no (to parody an author in mind) 
which once really pronounced by posterity, is 
rarely reversed. It is for the critic to con- 
sider what true worth remains after the changes 
of a score or two score years ; and in accord- 
ance with his opinion to place upon a pedestal 
in the hall of fame or to put on a high shelf 
in the garret. 

Kuskin must go up garret, there is no doubt 
of that ; and Thackeray is to have a place in 



the hall of fame, or better in our own front 
hall or the parlor. A small bust of Matthew 
Arnold will look well in the study ; that life- 
size statue of Carlyle might be put in one of 
the niches in the second story staircase ; that 
strange-looking picture of George Eliot will do 
for the spare room ; and Meredith may as well 
be left where he is, for he may have to be 
brought out. Such approximately is Mr. 
Brownell's disposition of these household 
favorites. 

What reasons does he consider in this mat- 
ter ? Well, he is not one of those critics who 
merely give you their personal impressions on 
reading " Vanity Fair " say, or " Sartor Kesar- 
tus." Nor is he a historical critic (or evolution- 
ary) who shows you that they were all exactly 
what they had to be and could by no means 
avoid having been. Nor even is he one of the 
strictly objective kind who have such definite 
knowledge of what the works of genius should 
be that they can tell you how near any par- 
ticular specimens come to perfection. Mr. 
Brownell is historical in so far as he considers 
the man always with his books and generally 
rather than his books. He is objective, how- 
ever, in so far as he puts before us a net result 
of each career. But given the net result, the 
question is, what is there in it, whereby 
Thackeray, Carlyle, and others should con- 
tinue to have a claim, or rather hold, on the 
attention of the world ? 

Here, of course, a critic can hardly avoid 
being somewhat personal. Certain qualities 
or virtues are of immense value to him, and he 
thinks an author worth while according as he 
has or has not something of these virtues. His 
preference may be founded upon the most solid 
groundwork of reason, but it is very apt to 
have something of a more personal basis. 

The qualities of most importance to Mr. 
Brownell are Temperament and Thought. Thus 
he still retains a fondness for George Eliot, 
because she can think, although temperament 
rather than thought is really the thing in a 
novelist ; and Carlyle is noteworthy for him in 
spite of the fact that his boisterous thinking 
did not end in much of consequence, because 
he did have the chief thing about genius, 
namely, personality, because no writer ever had 
so much temperament. So he cannot bear 
Ruskin because his didactic temperament was 
tedious, yet such as it was, entirely predomi- 
nated over his thought. And with Meredith, in 
spite of his intellectuality, Mr. Brownell cannot 
get over the fact that his temperament is really 



1902.] 



THE DIAL 



241 



absence of temperament. As to Thackeray, 
who holds first place in Mr. Brownell's mind, 
his is one of the most marked personalities in 
letters, " his personal force and charm take 
him quite outside " the operation of the rule 
recommending a detached attitude. And Mat- 
thew Arnold was essentially a critic, and a 
critic of a special kind, namely, one who applied 
ideas, a brain centre rather than a nerve centre. 

It would be wrong to imply that Mr. Brownell 
considers his authors purely from the stand- 
point of thought and temperament. He does 
not ; he has other matters in mind — art, in- 
fluence, history, — but no other matters are so 
important to him, and no others are so fre- 
quently applied in the way of a test. And I 
suppose for this reason his judgments will not 
appeal to all, for there may be some who do 
not care most for temperament or thought. 

In my novel reading, though I am very fond 
of Thackeray, I find that I remember Clara 
Mowbray's meeting with Francis Tyrrel, and 
Henry Durie at table with his wife and his 
elder brother, with a kind of thrill that I do 
not get in " Pendennis " or " The Newcomes." 
I am told there is something of the sort in a 
certain famous scene in " Vanity Fair "; it may 
be so, but not for me. For myself I value ro- 
mance — rather a poor name for the thing — 
more than personality or temperament. When 
we come to thought, in our critics, there I am 
more happily with Mr. Brownell, although even 
here I observe (with approach to shame) that 
my favorite critics are more apt to be men of 
a sense of beauty than of a sense of truth. 

But my own preferences aside, there is surely 
ground for thinking that a very important 
thing for a novelist is the power to create the 
romantic, the tragic, the emotional in life, and 
a very important thing for a critic to have a 
sure perception of what is beautiful in nature 
and in art. Mr. Brownell does not entirely 
neglect these matters, but they are evidently 
second in his mind to the more important con- 
siderations of temperament and thought. 

I am tempted to add a word on Mr. Brown- 
ell's style, not as a comment, or a caution 
either, but as a comfort to one who might other- 
wise begin upon the book without warning. 
In spite of one or two minor but real draw- 
backs,* the superficially repellent character of 
Mr. Brownell's mode of expression is, in the 
author's mind at least, one of the necessities

of exactness. It cannot be denied that he uses 
queer words : one would advise the average 
reader to keep within reaching distance of a 
dictionary. But the slight crabbedness arising 
from this cause is probably compensated for 
by the fact that the queer words usually do 
give some precise shade of meaning : poten- 
tialities, impressionistically, notablest, idiosyn- 
cratic, illogicality, dilutest, tropicality, insen- 
sitiveness, — they do look rather out of the 
way in a list ; but each in its own place they 
are seen to have a very specific meaning and 
one which could not otherwise be so shortly 
conveyed. So no one should be displeased by 
Mr. Brownell's style : with a little experience 
one gets to like it. 

For it is a style of which even the drawbacks 
arise from their having some thought to them. 
And this we may say of Mr. Brownell's work 
as a whole, that it has its roots in hard thinking. 
As the reader of his earlier books knows, you 
may disagree with particular views, you may 
think he has not the right standpoint for the 
best critical results, but you cannot criticise 
him at all without thinking the matter over 
pretty thoroughly yourself. Thus the work is 
stimulating, sometimes negatively, it is true, 
as well as often positively. And that is some- 
thing well worth while. I rather suppose his 
judgments are pretty sound, too, — that his 
authors will be found in the future much where 
he says they are. But that is a minor matter 
on the whole ; it would be a misfortune, in 
fact, if he fixed them all definitely for ever, 
for then just so much of the critic's occupation 
would be gone. Edward E. Hale, Jr. 



Columbus and the Toscanelli 

IjETTER.* 



Toscanelli's Letter of 1474 was first men- 
tioned by Las Casas in 1652, and next in 1571 
in a life of Columbus printed in Venice and 
attributed to his son Ferdinand. It is there 
spoken of as in Latin. In 1871 Harisse dis- 
covered in Spain, in a volume that once be- 
longed to Columbus, a Spanish version of the 
letter, supposed to be in the handwriting of 
Columbus. In 1875 the entire text of Las 
Casas was published for the first time. Hum- 
boldt was perhaps the first to assert that Co-

lumbus really received a letter and chart or 
map from Toscanelli, that influenced the voy- 
ages of Columbus, and his opinion has received 
the support of Fiske and Markham. Only of 
late years has the careful investigation of 
scholars led to the view now so clearly demon- 
strated by Vignaud and supported by those who 
agree with him in denying the authenticity of the 
alleged letter of Toscanelli. Vignaud, even in 
differing from them, pays due tribute to the 
erudition of those who maintain the other view, 
and especially of Harisse, its strongest advo- 
cate. 

In this exhaustive volume on the subject, just 
publishedjVignaud shows that there is no origi- 
nal of the letter or of any of the pretended cor- 
respondence of Toscanelli and Columbus, and 
that all knowledge of it depends on copies of 
a much later date. He points out that in no 
one of the numerous works, letters, and lives 
of the contemporaries, associates, and friends 
of Toscanelli, is there any mention of his theory 
of a western world. Fernand Columbus first 
spoke of it in a book printed in Florence in 
1571, and it is again referred to in a popular 
translation of the geography of the English- 
man Holywood, Italianized under the name of 
Sacrobosco, printed in 1672. Oddly enough 
the editor or translator errs as to the date 
of the return of Columbus, and puts it a year 
before his start ; and he makes him write then 
to Toscanelli, who died in 1482. However, in 
later editions of 1573 and 1579 the whole 
matter was omitted. Columbus himself wrote 
and spoke freely and frequently, yet he never 
referred to Toscanelli nor mentioned any cor- 
respondence with him nor acquaintance with or 
knowledge of him or of his letters or writings. 

Vignaud shows that the Toscanelli letter had 
neither scientific nor practical value, and could 
have been of no use either to Columbus or to 
the King of Portugal, who, like his father and 
brothers, was a good geographer. It is based 
on the ancient geography of Ptolemy, yet the 
first book on that subject was not printed 
until 1472, a year after the date of the pre- 
tended letter. Columbus did not need help 
from that source, for he based his geographical 
knowledge on Aristotle, and not on Ptolemy, 
and even that was at second hand, for he 
was no scholar. He left a well-thumbed copy, 
full of his notes, of the " Imago Mundi " of 
Cardinal d'Ailly, published about 1480, who 
copied from Roger Bacon's Opus majusof 1267. 
Columbus also left an annotated copy of Marco 
Polo, one of his guides. Columbus had no real 



scientific basis for his voyages and explorations, 
and found one only in later years. To credit 
him with a theory at the outset, instead of after 
his discovery, the pretended letter of Tosca- 
nelli was invented and palmed off by Las Casas 
and Fernand Columbus, so as to establish 
Columbus's reputation for scientific knowledge, 
and give him the credit of being the corre- 
spondent of Toscanelli, a famous authority on 
geography of his day. Columbus was charged 
with getting his information from an old pilot, 
— a story that was denounced by Washington 
Irving, the first and the fullest of the modern 
biographers of Columbus ; and by Harisse, the 
first of " Columbists " of our own day ; and by 
so many others that it is now wholly discredited. 
Yet Vignaud inclines to give it some weight, 
based on the fact that it was a rumor current 
during the time in which Columbus lived among 
his contemporaries. 

Having shown that Columbus himself never 
knew of any letter from Toscanelli, Vignaud 
proves by an exhaustive demonstration that 
Bartholomew Columbus, the brother of the 
great navigator, was the author of the forged 
letter, and that it was used by Las Casas, per- 
haps with knowledge of its source, for as he 
had access to and made free use of the Colum- 
bus family papers, he could not fail to know 
that Columbus himself never had any such 
letter from Toscanelli, and that it was produced 
only to give it a place in Las Casas's book, as 
an answer to charges against Columbus, which 
lessened the value of the claims of his family 
on the Spanish government. The old nobles 
objected to and opposed the dignities attained 
by the family of Columbus as a reward for his 
voyages and discoveries. Even more exhaust- 
ive is Vignaud's demonstration of the falsity 
of Las Casas's statement that he had before 
him as he wrote the chart or map sent by 
Toscanelli to Columbus with the pretended 
letter. 

Vignaud shows a thorough knowledge of 
the vexed questions of geography so often dis- 
cussed by Markham and Winsor, and many 
others. His book is a scholarly and exhaustive 
piece of historical work, well supported by an 
appendix containing a reproduction of the 
alleged letter and other original contemporary 
documents, and by a full, fair, and complete 
analysis of the arguments and evidence for and 
against his own view. It takes its due place 
in the series of early voyages to which Harisse 
has contributed his volumes on the Cabots and 
on Corte and Gaspard Real and on Columbus,

and Schaefer and Cordier and Hauser and 
Dorez their's on early voyages and geographical 
discoveries. Vignaud shows a large knowledge 
of all the literature of his subject, and a power 
of critical discrimination in using it so as to 
get at the truth and of setting it forth clearly. 
He is quite free from that intemperate tone 
that marks others, notably Harisse, whose 
great attainments are marred by his persistent 
assertions that anyone with an opinion that 
does not agree with his own must necessarily 
be wrong and must be told so very harshly.

The First English Novelist.* 



Samuel Richardson's novels are generally 
believed to belong to the class of books that 
are talked about but never read. The exces- 
sive length, the epistolary form, the unsym- 
pathetic social background, and the mild 
" tea-drinking " tone of his three works are 
supposed to render them distasteful to readers 
who devour their so-called romances by the 
tens of thousands. It is also objected that 
Richardson's chief theme is seduction, — a 
theme uncongenial to the manners and ideals 
of our time. Nevertheless Richardson has im- 
posed himself upon English literature as a 
"classic"; and there is reason to believe that his 
fame is likely to grow rather than wane, when 
the reading public comes back, after its periodic 
debauch of melodrama to a normal interest in 
the representation of human character. 

There has never been any question of Rich- 
ardson's position historically. He wrote the 
first novels of English life, as we understand 
the word novel — a fictitious picture of life 
that has some approach to probability. If we 
except the gentle shadow of Sir Roger, and the 
vigorous figure of Robinson Crusoe, the first 
characters in English fiction — imaginatively 
conceived, organically developed — are Pamela, 
Clarissa, and Lovelace. In spite of Fielding's 
keen satire, we must admit that Richardson 
presented the petty world of the middle of the 
eighteenth century more justly, more minutely, 
with a truer feeling for its manners and ideals, 
than did the great master himself. And in 
construction, in the sense of form, " Clarissa 
Harlowe " is superior to " Tom Jones." More- 
over, Richardson has the honor largely of dis- 

•Thb Novblb of Samubi, Richardson. With Intro- 
dnotion by Ethel M. M. McKenna. In twenty volumes, illna- 
trated. Philadelphia : J. B. Lippincott Co. 



covering a new reading public, and one that 
has continued to support enormously the novel, 
— the middle class. Perhaps most important 
of all, Richardson first developed a field of lit- 
erary material (^possibly following Marivaux) 
that has yielded rich harvests to a long line of 
English novelists, — the field of feminine sen- 
sibilities and sentiments. Lastly, Richardson 
has influenced continental literature directly 
and indirectly more than any writer of his time. 
But Richardson has a far greater claim to 
his seat among the immortals than that of his- 
torical significance : he created one work that 
is of permanent importance, for which no al- 
lowances have to be made. Mere length of 
itself never killed any book, and the nine vol- 
umes of " Clarissa Harlowe " still command 
the reader, — nay, absorb him, if once he sub- 
mits himself wholly to their skilful pages. The 
very length of the piece is a part of its art, for 
this breadth of treatment permits the gradual 
development of character, the fine gradation 
of values, the winding process of thorough 
analysis, which fix forever a picture of life. 
Grreat novelists have always appreciated the 
necessity of length. The story of two or three 
hundred octavo pages is an invention of the 
modern book-maker to meet a commercial 
opportunity. Moreover, in unity of plan, in 
comprehensiveness of design, and in dramatic 
relationship of values, " Clarissa Harlowe " is 
one of the very few English novels that can 
pretend to perfection of form. Structurally 
it is, as Richardson says somewhere, " a dra- 
matic narrative." Lovelace, the mind of the 
piece, and Clarissa, the soul of the piece, are 
two of the small group of fictitious characters 
that have a permanent type existence. Love- 
lace is a superb creation. For wit, power, pure 
intellectual brilliancy and mastery, he is the 
ablest villain outside the drama in English 
literature. The mystery of his creation, if we 
consider Richardson's temperament and ex- 
perience in life, is far greater than that of 
Clarissa, or, if we consider Fielding, than that 
of Tom Jones. Mr. Saintsbury's jeer at Rich- 
ardson as " the old maid of genius " falls flat 
when we realize the full virility of Lovelace. 
The style through which Lovelace reveals 
the involutions and subtleties of his nature is 
unique in its absolute adaptation and consist- 
ency. Beside the restless play of his brilliant 
mind, the "divine Clarissa" even is a more 
ordinary conceptiop. Yet the delicacy and 
thoroughness of her portraiture have saved her 
from the cold formality of her conception. In 



244 



THE DIAL 



[April 1, 



spite of Richardson, we feel that she loves 
Lovelace, "cruel as a panther" as he is, and 
that in her steady refusal to consider the pos- 
sibility of reparation, and in her death, she is 
the equal of Lovelace. In refusing to allot a 
happy ending to Clarissa, Richardson tran- 
scended the limitations of his class and of his 
age. Thus the theme of the novel, to which 
objection has been made, has been raised by 
the force of Richardson's art above the vulgar 
matter of seduction. It is rather the struggle 
between exact purity of soul and the predatory 
habit of the male. He who sees in " Clarissa 
Harlowe " a mere fencing match over the mar- 
riage contract misses the tale altogether. 

Richardson's morality is not our morality. 
" Pamela " will remain as a comic example of 
didactic ineptitude, and " Sir Charles Grandi- 
son " as a pompous and tiresome lesson in 
manners. But in spite of his fatal desire to 
teach lessons of conduct, Richardson triumphed 
in " Clarissa Harlowe " over the weight of his 
moral intention, just as he triumphed over the 
limitation of his literary form, and over the 
conventions and sterility of his age. In spite 
of himself, as it were, he created some real 
people and surrendered himself to them with 
the complete insight and fidelity that is the 
mark of the artist. Richardson's world was 
a petty world in many respects. We flatter 
ourselves that we live more largely to-day. But 
" Clarissa Harlowe " is another proof that, for 
the making of permanent art, the accident of 
material is comparatively unimportant. 

The present edition, in twenty handy and 
well-printed volumes, is a reprint of the text 
of Mangin's 1811 edition, with reproductions 
of the original engravings. Miss McKenna's 
brief introduction presents adequately the chief 
biographical and critical facts.

Burton's "Wanderings in Three 
Continents."* 



Sir Richard Burton was perhaps the most 
redoubtable explorer of modern times ; and to 
those who love adventure, his will always be a 
fascinating name. The posthumous volume by 
him, entitled " Wanderings in Three Con- 
tinents," is spoken of by the editor, Mr. W. H. 

* Wanderings in Three Continents. By the late 
Captain Sir Richard F. Burton. Edited, with a Preface, by 
W. H. Wilkins, M.A. Illustrated. New York: Dodd, 
Mead & Co. 



Wilkins, as a collection of " essays," but would 
more rightly be called sketches or memoranda 
of Burton's principal travels in Asia, Africa, 
and America. This book includes brief ac- 
counts of his wonderful Medinah-Mecca pil- 
grimage, of his Harat and Tanganika explora- 
tions, of his Dahome and Congo trips, of his 
travels in Brazil and the Western United 
States, and of his Palmyra journey. Burton 
always had an eye to scenery, and some of his 
descriptions are very vivid — notably this pic- 
ture of the Arabian desert : 

" The sky is terrible in its pitiless splendours and 
blinding beauty, while the simoon, or wind of the wild, 
caresses the cheek with the flaming breath of a lion. 
The filmy spray of sand and the upseething of the at- 
mosphere, the heat-reek and the dancing of the air upon 
the baked surface of the bright yellow soil, blending 
with the dazzling hue above, invests the horizon with a 
broad band of deep dark green, and blurs the gaunt 
figures of the camels, which, at a distance, appear 
strings of gigantic birds." 

Or take this picture of an extensive region in 
East Africa : 

"The black greasy ground, veiled with thick shrub- 
bery, supports in the more open spaces screens of tiger 
and spear-grass twelve and thirteen feet high, with 
every blade a finger's breadth; and the towering treea 
are often clothed with huge creepers, forming heavy 
columns of densest verdure. The earth, ever rain- 
drenched, emits the odour of sulphuretted hydrogen, 
and in some parts the traveller might fancy a corpse to 
be hidden behind every bush. That no feature of 
miasma might be wanting to complete the picture, filthy 
heaps of the meanest hovels sheltered their miserable 
inhabitants, whose frames are lean with constant in- 
toxication, and whose limbs are distorted with ulcerous 
sores." 

But on the whole the most interesting sketch 
in this book is that of his journey to Salt Lake 
City in 1860. This is very readable and 
graphic, and, as the editor says, " much better 
than his bulky book on the same subject." 
He records three " novel sensations " that his 
American trip gave him : 

<« The first was, to feel that all men were your equal. 
. . . The second was to see one's quondam acquaint- 
ance, the Kaffir or Negro, put by his grass kilt and 
coat of grease, insert himself in broadcloth, part his 
wool on one side, shave, and call himself, not Sambo, 
but « Mr. Scott.' The third was to meet in the Rocky 
Mountains with a refreshing specimen of that far-off 
Old World." 

Burton showed through all .his life a savage 
independence, which reflects itself in a strong, 
terse, blunt literary style. His multifarious 
works are, for the general reader, too diffuse, 
and on the other hand this epitome is too con- 
densed ; yet it is the best outline of his travels 



now available.

Recent Fiction.* 



The work which must occupy the first place in 
the present review is " The Valley of Decision," 
by Mrs. Edith Wharton. Mrs. Wharton's earlier 
books have had the touch of distinction, and pre- 
pared us for something unusual when the time should 
come for her to put forth her whole power in a 
novel of large plan and comprehensive content. The 
qualities displayed by her short stories were such 
as to suggest the work of a master-hand, making us 
think at one moment, which impressed by their 
analytical subtlety, of the work of Mr. Henry James, 
and at another, which impressed by their artistic 
finality, of the work of no less a man than Tour- 
gudnieff. Suggestions of this sort being now in 
order, it may be said that the masterpiece of Stendhal 
has been constantly in our mind while reading 
" The Valley of Decision." This comparison, how- 
ever, is subject to qualifications, and may serve as 
a starting-point for what we wish to say concerning 
Mrs. Wharton's work. By way of similarity, the 
two books have in common the same scenes, the 
same society, and (within a generation) the same 
period. The Duchy of Pianura is not found upon 
any map, but it cannot be far removed from the 
region to which '< La Chartreuse de Parme " leads 
as a willing sojourner. Nor does the fact that we 
are dealing with the period leading up to, and con- 
temporary with, the French Revolution, instead of 
the post- Napoleonic period, make any very essential 
difference. The liberal ferment is already at work ; 
it has simply not reached a stage so far advanced. 
It finds expression in the writings of Alfieri, on the

one hand, and, on the other, in the patient endeavors 
of the economist and the jurist. It has not yet 
been translated into political terms, although such 
a translation is clearly impending, and although the 
principal character is a man in the vanguard of the 
thought of the age. So much having been said for 
the resemblance of the two works, there remains 
the task of emphasizing their contrast. The obvious 
difference, we should say, is that Mrs. Wharton's 
novel is over-intellectualized, and thus misses the 
rich vitality of Stendhal's masterpiece. In Mrs. 
Wharton's view, the idea, having more lasting sig- 
nificance than the act, is everywhere set in the 
foreground. Stendhal, for his part, had curious 
lapses from his professed liberalism, and was more 
bent upon depicting the glow and color, the in- 
trigues and the passions, of the period in question, 
than concerned with the deeper currents of the in- 
tellectual movement. He had, moreover, the ines- 
timable advantage of studying his material at first 
hand, whereas Mrs. Wharton has learned about it 
from books, which inevitably means a less vivid 
realization of its possibilities. To a reflective mind, 
" The Valley of Decision " makes the stronger ap- 
peal of the two books, for it is the expression of a 
consistent philosophy, and, if somewhat pale upon the 
sensuous side and somewhat weak upon the emotional 
side, there is no doubt of its inspiration by a true 
intellectual passion. The restraint which goes with 
all distinguished art is characteristic of this book 
even in the most pronounced spiritual crises of the 
action, and to a fine sense makes these scenes the 
more effective. After all, it is a drama having the 
human soul for its theatre that we are invited to 
view, rather than a drama of spectacular interest. 
The central theme is that of a man of fine impulses, 
becoming, by the accidents of his own birth and of 
the death of those standing above him, the ruler of 
a state. He is overweighted by his responsibilities, 
but honestly seeks the welfare of his people. Finally, 
the ingratitude of the populace which he has sought 
to benefit, whose passions are successfully worked 
upon by the partisans of the old corrupt order, hurls 
him from the seat of power, and leaves him in the 
end an outcast. This situation is by no means new 
in imaginative literature. Bulwer's " Rienzi " dealt 
with it in a melodramatic sort of fashion, and in 
more modern literature it has received impressive 
illustration in the " Majesty " of the Dutch novelist, 
Herr Couperus, and in " The King," a drama 
which is one of the most extraordinary of the works 
of Herr BjOrnson. Mrs. Wharton has not been 
insensible of the pathetic and tragic possibilities of 
the situation, and has developed them with rare 
and subtle art. The novel leaves little to be desired 
in the delicacy of its individual characterizations, in 
its exhibition of the inner life of the society which 
it depicts, and in its deft use of the physical acces- 
sories of the narrative. The charm of its finished 
style is a source of constant delight to the reader, 
and makes acceptable the many pages of historical 
and philosophical analysis, which, strictly speaking, 



246 



THE DIAL 



[April 1, 



must be regarded as out of place in a work of 
fiction. We would not willingly spare the longest 
of these passages, although they very noticeably 
impede the progress of the action. 

The story of the first European discovery of the 
New World, as preserved for us in the saga of Eric 
the Red and the Flateyarbdk, has been utilized by 
Miss Ottilie Liljencrantz for the framework of her 
story called " The Thrall of Leif the Lucky." She 
has been exceptionally ingenious in working into a 
consistent narrative every scrap of information to 
be gleaned from the saga records, and in adding 
enough invention of her own to sustain the interest. 
How Leif accepted Christianity from Olaf Trygvas- 
son at Nidaros, how he voyaged to Greenland and 
quarreled with his father on this score, how he was 
fired by the tale of Bjarni's adventure of a few 
years earlier, how he set sail for those strange lands 
that had been sighted but not explored, and how he 
built his booths in Vinland, wintered there, and 
returned the following spring laden with wine and 
furs and timber, to be acclaimed as the greatest 
man of his age — all these things, and many more, 
are related in this fascinating volume. Lifelike 
figures are drawn from the merest hints in the Ice- 
landic chronicle, and even the German Tyrker 
becomes a real personage, although we must regard 
as somewhat unhappy the attempt to dififerentiate 
his race by filling his speech with Germanic inver- 
sions. If this is intended for comic relief, it had 
better have been omitted. The book has the novelty 
of colored illustrations, six in number, which add 
materially to its attractiveness. The chapters are 
appropriately headed with quotations from the 
H^vam^l. 

Miss Johnston's third novel of Colonial Virginia, 
" Audrey " by name, does not seem to us equal to 
its predecessors. The vein shows signs of exhaustion, 
as is illustrated by a greater straining for effects, 
and a more liberal allowance of ''manners and 
customs." The period is that of the early seven- 
teenth century, and among the historical characters 
we meet Colonel Byrd of Westover, whose literary 
remains have been brought into the author's service. 
Audrey is a child rescued from the Indians by a 
young Virginian landed proprietor, and placed in 
the hands of a besotted minister. The rescuer goes 
to England for ten years, and returns to find that 
the child has been an uncomplaining sufferer from 
harsh treatment, and that she has grown to be a 
beautiful woman. How the hero struggles with his 
love for her, until in the end he throws pride to the 
winds and makes Audrey his wife, is the essential 
matter of the novel. One of the most successful 
figures in the book is that of his bondman, an un- 
reconciled Jacobite, who has vowed hatred to his 
master, and who is won over to love him by his 
kindliness and grave courtesy. Miss Johnston has 
not forgotten how to purvey excitement for her 
readers, and many are the daring adventures and 
brave combats to be found in this, no less than in her 
other books. 



The flood of Colonial novels is unabated, and it 
is impossible to find room for mention of more than 
a few of the productions of this class. In addition 
to "Audrey," two other exceptionally good examples 
are found among those recently published. " The 
Strength of the Weak " is a romance of New France 
in the days just preceding the Seven Years' War 
— the days of Bigot and Vaudreuil in Canada, the 
days when Braddock and William Johnson were 
making a stir in the South. The leading characters 
are a young seigneur of English origin, and an 
American maiden in distress. Both are persecuted 
by the French villain of the story, and succeed, 
after many adventures, in escaping into New York. 
The adventures are of the familiar type, including 
a hairsbreadth escape from a besieged house, a 
perilous river and lake voyage, and the danger of 
pursuit by a wily and devilish Indian, the motive 
of whose course is unapparent. There is no end of 
sword-play, and the hero's part therein is both 
valiant and magnanimous. 

" The Colonials," by Mr. Allen French, begins 
in the Indian country of the West, where we make 
the acquaintance of hero and heroine, in their nat- 
ural roles of rescuer and rescued. Then the scene 
shifts to Boston, and we have an interesting de- 
velopment of plot, with the tea-party, the Port Bill, 
Lexington, Bunker Hill, and the British evacuation 
for a historical background. Mr. French has done 
well to interest us at all in matter so hackneyed, 
but his story has abundant action, and the villain, 
with the usual persistence of his kind, escapes his 
dues long enough to keep the plot alive through 
five hundred pages. The historical part of the book 
is more minutely studied than is usually the case in 
romances of this sort, and might almost serve as a 
text-book for those three years of the annals of 
Massachusetts. 

On two recent occasions, we have had the pleasure 
of indicating the remarkable literary qualities of 
the work of Father Sheehan. In both prose and 
verse he has given evidence of an unusual degree 
of intellectual power and an unusual gift of style. 
The life of the parish priest in Ireland has rarely 
been portrayed with the sympathy of " My New 
Curate," and the spiritual life has rarely been ex- 
pressed with the poetical beauty of " Cithara Mea." 
A new book by Father Sheehan must, then, receive 
some attention, and particularly a book which is 
evidently the most pretentious performance of its 
distinguished author. "Luke Delmege " is a novel 
of nearly six hundred pages. We say a novel, in 
default of a better term, for the life-history of a 
Catholic priest must get along without the elements 
of interest that chiefly appeal to the reader of novels. 
Obviously, it cannot be a love-story, and must make 
up for this deprivation by the exhibition of other 
qualities sufficiently striking to justify its flaim to 
existence. " Luke Delmege " has such qualities in 
abundance, and holds the attention of its readers 
by its intimate revelation of the spiritual and in- 
tellectual life of its hero, and by its deep insight

into the Irish character, so lovable in certain aspects, 
so exasperating in others. Father Luke, who be- 
gins his active life with the prestige of a first prize- 
man of Maynooth, is himself too intellectualized to 
understand the character of his fellow-countrymen, 
and it is only after a long and painful struggle that 
he comes to be a sharer in their sympathies and 
learns how to adapt himself to his environment. 
This he has nearly succeeded in doing, when death 
ends his career, finding him still, in his own words, 
" a puzzled man." The extraordinary interest with 
which this life-history is invested by Father Sheehan 
must be accounted for by the fact that he brings to 
its composition a mind richly stored with the results 
of modern culture, yet acutely sensitive to the 
spiritual, even when resting upon an irrational basis. 
The work has just enough of mysticism to lift it 
into a rarer atmosphere than that which men habit- 
ually breathe, and to bring into relief the symbolical 
aspects of those religious practices and beliefs which, 
narrowly considered, are apt to seem trivial, me- 
chanical, or grossly materialistic. 

Another novel in which the Catholic religion, 
rather than the individual actors, provides the 
chief element of interest is Mr. Richard Bagot's 
" Casting of Nets." Here, however, we find little 
or nothing of the spiritual element, but rather a 
mesh of intrigue, hypocrisy, and underhanded deal- 
ing which may represent the practice of base indi- 
viduals in the Roman communion, but which we 
decline to accept as representative of the spirit of 
that organization. How proselytes are made by 
the arts of unscrupulous zealots is the theme of 
Mr. Bagot's story, but his bias is too marked to 
make his story convincing. A young English 
woman of Catholic family is married to a Protestant 
nobleman, and her mind is so worked upon by her 
relatives and advisers that she becomes very un- 
happy at the thought of the religious differences 
existing between herself and her husband. In the 
struggle between her love and the conception of 
duty that is in a measure thus forced upon her, she 
suffers greatly, but her love triumphs in the end, 
and the falsity of what she had once thought to be 
duty is made clear to her conscience. This conclu- 
sion will be applauded by every right-minded reader, 
and we fancy that a Catholic of Father Sheehan's 
type would be among those whose approval was the 
most earnest. The book has a certain neatness and 
decorum of expression, but is at the best a dull per- 
formance. Any single chapter of " Luke Delmege " 
outweighs the whole volume of " Casting of Nets." 

Mr. Hamilton Aid^ is a pleasant novelist whose 
work is absolutely superficial. " The Snares of the 
World " is a story of modern English society, 
tricked out with most of the conventional trappings, 
and relieved only by one romantic episode which 
takes the heroine into unknown Hungary as the 
guest of a territorial magnate. Mr. Aidd has 
recently made a trip to Hungary, and the oppor- 
tunity to give an account of his observations is 
too good to be missed, although this section of his 



work is quite out of keeping with the rest. There is 
neither genuine passion nor genuine characterization 
in this story, although both are doubtless attempted ; 
it is simply an agreeable and decorous tale of social 
life, revealing the polished man of the world rather 
than the literary artist. 

"The Usurper," Mr. William J. Locke's latest 
novel, is the story of an Englishman who, by a 
strange caprice of fortune in Australia, becomes 
the owner of property upon which valuable mineral 
deposits are discovered. He becomes a millionaire, 
returns to England, and engages in vast schemes 
of philanthropy. After a while, there appears upon 
the scene a man whom the hero believes to be the 
rightful owner of all the property — the man whom 
he has long supposed to be dead. As a matter of 
fact, this unwelcome intruder is not the owner after 
all, but this does not appear until the end. Mean- 
while, the hero is face to face with the problem of 
abandoning his helpful work, and giving up his 
estate to a person of vicious life and worthless 
character. He temporizes, determines to keep his 
secret for a while, and go on with his enterprises. 
A dramatic climax is reached in a parliamentary 
campaign, when the hero, a candidate for election, 
is charged in a public meeting of his constituents 
with his seemingly fraudulent course. Believing 
the charge to be just, he admits its truth, and is 
about to retire in face of the scandal, when the real 
truth comes out, and his position becomes unim- 
peachable. Those who know Mr. Locke's earlier 
work will understand how effective a story must 
have been made out of this material ; they will also 
be prepared for a slight overplus of sentimentality 
and a tendency toward a subdued sort of melodra- 
matic effect. 

Curiously enough, Mr. Anthony Hope's "Tris- 
tram of Blent " has a plot that is identical, in the 
essentials, with that of the novel just described. 
Here also a man holds a large estate knowing that 
it is not rightfully his own ; here also the rightful 
heir is the woman whom he loves, and with whom 
his marriage, after many complications, provides a 
satisfactory disentanglement of the coil into which 
his fortunes have been twisted. In the case of Mr. 
Hope's novel, the hero believes himself morally en- 
titled to the estate, and is determined to conceal 
the secret as long as possible, and to fight for his 
position if the secret shall ever be revealed. All 
these fine resolutions are, however, made futile by 
the appearance of the young woman on the scene, 
and, in an impulsive moment, Tristram abandons 
his position as resolutely as he has hitherto defended 
it. At the very end, he turns out to be the rightful 
owner after all, but he is shrewd enough to win his 
suit before revealing a fact which might pitch the 
heroine's pride to the point of rejecting him forever. 
The whole of which story, with the many complica- 
tions and side-issues, is related with the most ad- 
mirable art ; Mr. Hope's craftsmanship is almost 
unerring in fitting means to ends, and his characters 
are endowed with the very breath of life.

THE DIAL 



[April 1, 



Mr. Arthur W. Marchmont, the author of " For 
Love or Crown," has written just the sort of story 
that we used to expect from Mr. Hope, — a story 
after the " Zenda " model, — dealing with imaginary 
intrigues for the possession of an imaginary throne. 
The heroine is a girj of English training, who is in 
reality — although she does not know it until she 
is grown up — the legitimate successor to the rule 
of a petty German state. Meanwhile, she has 
given her heart into the keeping of a fine young 
Englishman, and persists in her allegiance after the 
discovery, although her ohstinacy upsets various 
dynastic calculations. In the end, she acts in such 
manner as to let it appear that her right of succes- 
sion is based upon an error, and thus virtually ab- 
dicates her crown for the sake of her affection. The 
story is among the better examples of the class to 
which it belongs, is provided with much exciting 
incident, and ends in a way which satisfies the ro- 
mantic soul of its readers. 

Mr. A. E. W. Mason's " Clementina " is a sort 
of continuation of the " Parson Kelly " which he 
wrote in collaboration with Mr. Andrew Lang. It 
is a historical novel, with the Stuart pretender and 
the Polish princess for its leading characters, nom- 
inally speaking, and the ingenious Mr. Charles 
Wogan for its real hero. How this inventive Irish- 
man plans the royal marriage, and causes it to be 
consummated after incredible difficulties, including 
a rescue of the Princess Clementina from her 
Austrian prison, is related in a manner which, if 
not convincing, at least leaves nothing to be desired 
upon the romantic side. 

The massacre of St. Bartholomew has been rather 
overworked of late by the romantic novelists, but 
Mr. Stanley Weyman has ventured to make use of 
it in '< Count Hannibal," his latest fiction. Instead, 
however, of saving it for the climax by his inven- 
tion, he starts out with it, and his plot is mainly 
developed out of the subsequent happenings. In 
this development he has resorted to a curious device. 
We begin with the conventional Huguenot lovers and 
their Catholic persecutor, who seeks the hand of the 
maiden and the destruction of the man. Presently, 
we notice that our sympathies are gradually be- 
coming estranged from the lover and attached to 
the persecutor. This process goes on by slow 
stages until the former is revealed as but a poor 
fellow after all, while the latter emerges clearly into 
view as the real hero. The heroine comes to take 
the same view of the matter, after a long struggle 
with herself, and finally learns to love her whilom 
enemy. This change of sentiment is most ingeniously 
managed, and successfully enlists our convictions. 
The story o£fers excellent entertainment, besides 
conveying a modicum of historical instruction. 

Mr. S. R. Crockett has published so many hastily- 
written and slovenly novels during the past few 
years that it is something of a surprise to note the 
marked superiority of " The Firebrand," his latest 
book. While not intending to praise this romance 
as in any sense a masterpiece, we will say that it 



is far above the author's usual level, and well de- 
serving of attention. The scene is Spain in the 
thirties, and the struggle between Carlists and 
Cristinos provides the theme. A fiery young Scotch 
adventurer and soldier of fortune is the hero, while 
the heroine is a courageous Spanish coquette who 
at last finds in him her master, and whose quick 
and daring invention saves his life on more than 
one occasion. An attempt to carry the Queen and 
the child Princess away from La Granja, and to 
place them in the custody of Holy Church, provides 
the central subject of the plot. The story is told 
with much animation and variety of picturesque 
episode, and is unflagging in its interest. It is, 
moreover, the work of a close observer of Spanish 
life and character, of one at home amid the customs, 
the scenery, and the history of the Peninsula. 

Curiously enough, Mr. Henry Seton Merriman's 
new novel, " The Velvet Glove," is also a story of 
Carlist adventure, although in this case it is the 
movement of the seventies, not of the thirties, that 
engages our attention. The Jesuit is Mr. Merri- 
man's bHe noire, and he paints a dark picture of 
Jesuitical intrigue in behalf of the reactionary cause. 
A young girl, left an orphan and heiress to an im- 
mense fortune, occupies the centre of interest in the 
book, and we rejoice with the author when the hero 
outwits the schemers who aim to secure this fortune 
for the Carlist treasury. This he accomplishes by 
marrying the girl in secret, just as she is about to 
be forced into the religious life. He is a very un- 
Spanish lover in his self-restraint and lack of ardor, 
and the girl has some difficulty in discovering that 
he really cares for her, and has not married her for 
the sake of her fortune. Like all of Mr. Merri- 
man's stories, " The Velvet Glove " abounds in vivid 
descriptions, dramatic effects, and sententious phi- 
losophizings. There is a neglect of finish in some 
of the details that proves rather surprising, and a 
number of the minor incidents are left without their 
proper logical development. But the core of the 
plot is sound, and the half-dozen leading characters 
have a distinct individuality.

Captain Mahan ^a^J readers will find a delightful 
onihe heroes of surprise in Captain Mahan 's latest 
the Bruuh navy. ^^^^^ ^^ « Types of Naval Officers 
drawn from the History of the British Navy " 
(Little, Brown, & Co.). From its title, one might 
have expected to find the work rather technical in 
character, and instructive rather than entertaining 
to a layman. But it proves to be an interesting 
and stirring book, full of the charm that is given 
by heroic deeds described with clearness and spirit, 
and by noble characters portrayed with insight and 
discrimination as well as professional pride. A 
preliminary sketch gives an account of the condition 
of naval warfare at the beginning of the eighteenth

century, and a general account of its subsequent 
developnaent during the century. By 1750 the 
spirit that had made the navy of England powerful 
during the stirring times of revolution had burnt 
itself out, and the material aims and sluggish peace 
of Walpole's time were reflected in the sluggishness 
and decay of the navy. A full account is given of 
this ine£Bciency under Mathews and Byng, to show, 
as the author says, the zero of the scale from which 
the navy was raised by the great admirals of whom 
the book treats to the glories of Nelson's day. Not 
only Mathews and Byng, but also the officers of the 
later part of the century, show how habit and tra- 
dition carry the mass of men along, how little the 
activity of the average man is the result of inde- 
pendent thinking, how rare is the spark of intuition 
that marks genius. Regulations laid down specific 
methods of attack ; these must be followed, modi- 
fying conditions were not recognized, and so fleets 
were lost through what seems to a layman absolute 
stupidity in the form of inability to take advantage 
of circumstances. All of these inefficient men 
were brave ; but their dulness, intensified by the 
stupidity of the iron-clad regulations inherited from 
an earlier day of different methods under which 
they worked, reduced the British navy to the piti- 
able helplessness marked by the disaster of the un- 
fortunate Byng in 1756. The same regulations 
continued in force ; but the man of brains and in- 
sight, in the person of Hawke, could ignore this 
*' caricature of systematized tactics " when need 
came, and wrest victories out of hostile odds. Even 
after such lessons, contemporary judgment attributed 
the failures to specific things, and not to the bad 
system and false tactical standards. Captain Mahan 
says truly that no servitude is more helpless than 
that of unintelligent submission to an idea formally 
correct yet incomplete. After this portrayal of exist- 
ing conditions when the war of the Austrian Succes- 
sion broke out. Captain Mahan takes up the study 
of the six great naval officers whose achievements 
added so much to the glory of England during the 
latter half of the eighteenth century. Their names 
mean little to one who is not well read in naval 
history, but they are well worth knowing, and this 
book will do good service in bringing them before 
the reading public in an attractive way. The six 
names are Hawke, who typifies the spirit of the 
new methods ; Rodney, the form ; Howe, the gen- 
eral officer, as tactician ; Jervis, the general officer, 
as disciplinarian and strategist ; Saumarez, the fleet 
officer and division commander; and Pellew, the 
frigate captain and partisan officer. Each of these 
sturdy and efficient sailors and fighters is carefully 
portrayed, and his special influence upon the devel- 
opment of the British navy is traced. 

In his book on " Ruskin and the 
English Lakes" (Macmillan), the 
Rev. H. D. Rawnsley has furnished 
a supplementary volume to his earlier works, " Life 
and Nature at the English Lakes " and " Literary 



Ruskin and 
the Englith 
Lake region. 



Associations of the English Lakes," as well as to 
CoUingwood's " Life and Work of John Ruskin." 
The present volume will be of interest to all Ruskin 
disciples ; it treats of recent events, and is the ex- 
pression of one who is a very genuine admirer of 
his subject, if somewhat over-emotional in his style. 
Canon Rawnsley records Ruskin's various visits to 
the Lakes from his earliest childhood, showing the 
impressions made on the growing boy by mountains, 
woods, and water, — impressions finally culminat- 
ing in an affection so strong that when, after a 
severe illness, he felt the need of a restful retreat he 
purchased Brantwood for his future home. His 
love for this beautiful region, thus early formed, 
never left him ; and on every trip abroad in his 
after-life his letters expressed his homesickness and 
longing for the home of his heart, where he lived 
so long and where he finally died. The home-life 
at Brantwood is described as being very simple, 
but beautified by the love of friends; the cottage 
was always a peaceful haven ior a much over- 
worked and much suffering man. Canon Rawnsley 
gives a chapter to the Ruskin Exhibition which 
took place at Coniston Institute in the summer of 
1901, and describes many of the pictures (about 
two hundred in all), and some of the articles associ- 
ated with Ruskin that added interest to the exhibit. 
The chapter entitled <* Ruskin and the Home Art 
Industries in the Lake District " describes the Kes- 
wick School of Industrial Art and the Ruskin Linen 
Industry, their beginnings, development, and work. 
These industries were inspired by Ruskin's teach- 
ings, and were encouraged by his messages while 
he lived ; they have accomplished much in the way 
of beautiful and honest work, and have provided 
happy employment for many humble folks, some 
of whom have developed unsuspected talent. Some 
forty pages are given to showing how much Ruskin 
had in common with Wordsworth, in spite of his 
occasional dissenting words. The book contains 
several illustrations from photographs, and is fur- 
nished with an index. 



Maryland as 
a Proprietary 
Province. 



The rich materials of American co- 
lonial life and history have afforded 
many excellent subjects for special 
investigation by graduate students in our universi- 
ties, and none better than that selected by Mr. 
Newton D. Mereness, a fellow in Columbia, the 
results of whose labors appear in a dissertation on 
" Maryland as a Proprietary Province," now pub- 
lished by the Macmillan Co. The charter granted 
to Lord Baltimore conferred upon him great pow- 
ers, — perhaps the greatest ever given by an English 
king to a subject, — and at the same time it re- 
stricted him by three brief clauses which forbade 
the taking away " the right or interest of any per- 
son, or persons, of, or in member, life, freehold, 
goods or chattels," provided that the laws and or- 
dinances should be reasonable and, so far as con- 
venient, like the laws and customs of England, and 
declared that the people of Maryland should be

entitled to all the privileges and franchisea and 
liberties which other English subjects enjoyed. This 
particular doctor's thesis shows how the people, 
through their representatives, gradually encroached 
upon the powers of the proprietary, until, when the 
time came for transition from colony to common- 
wealth after the Declaration of Independence, the 
people were practically supreme in every depart- 
ment of government. The volume contains a vast 
amount of material illustrating the political, eco- 
nomic, religious, military, and social history of the 
province in colonial days ; and because of the pe- 
culiar nature of the feudal grants made to the pro- 
prietor, and the mixed population, religion being 
considered, there is much interest in following out 
the various phases of Maryland's life. The accom- 
panying bibliography indicates the richness of 
Maryland as a field for investigation, and suggests 
gratification that the beginnings of our national life 
are being so carefully studied by earnest workers. 



Afatnctu 
romance 
of hUtory. 



In " The Diamond Necklace " (Lip- 
pincott) Frantz Funck-Brentano, 
through his translator, Mr. H. Suth- 
erland Edwards, gives us an account of the famous 
episode of Marie Antoinette's downfall, in the clear 
light thrown upon it by recently-discovered docu- 
ments. Regarding the affair as explicable only 
when considered as the result of strange personali- 
ties played on by one another, the author intro- 
duces in succession the various collaborators — Mme. 
de la Motte the intriguer, Cardinal Rohan the dupe, 
Cagliostro the riddle, and Queen Marie herself, 
who, without part or profit in the transaction, yet 
had to suffer its worst consequences. Then follows 
a vivid picture of the trial, as it went on in and out 
of court ; and a statement of the verdict rendered 
by court and populace. The very complicated in- 
trigue is presented in a remarkably clear and inter- 
esting manner, the interpretation of the facts is 
convincing, and the moot- point — the possibility 
that Rohan, man of the world as he was, should be 
in some matters a credulous child — is very satis- 
factorily accounted for. There is constant emphasis 
on the light which the affair throws on the mind 
and heart of pre-revolutionary France. Being thus 
taken as typical, it assumes a wider interest and 
justifies the extended treatment which at first 
thought seemed disproportionate to its importance. 



TwoofPMarMs ^r. Bemadotte Perrin, professor of 
"Lives" in a Greek in Yale University, has ap- 
neto translation. proached his task in translating and 
elucidating "Plutarch's Themistocles and Aristides" 
(Scribner ) with a mingled spirit of modern scholar- 
ship and veneration for the old biographer and 
moralist which makes the volume doubly grateful. 
The translation of the two " Lives " serves as a 
basis for a preface, a series of four introductions, 
critical and historical, and voluminous notes, which 
together form more than three-fourths of the book's 
contents. Dr. Perrin's rendering into English is 



a happy adaptation of the two great translations 
of Plutarch, — North's, and the one called Dryden's, 
— with the necessary differences. " I have not 
tried," says Dr. Perrin in his preface, " to write a 
learned book for the learned, but one which may 
attract an ordinary English reader of culture and 
taste toward learning." Yet there is food for the 
learned, too, in the various apparatus with which the 
work of Plutarch is here surrounded. All that is 
known of the man himself, all that is known of the 
men of whom he writes, and of their times, has been 
fully digested and set in order for the enlighten- 
ment of those who must always find the finest of 
inspirations in the careers of such men as Themis- 
tocles and Aristides. It may be hoped that this 
book will serve as the introductory volume in a 
series which will include all of Plutarch's heroes 
and fellow-countrymen. 

The biography "^long with the current of interest in 
of a sturdy historical fiction, there seems to be an 

English Saint. allied interest in biography. Readers 
of an imaginative representation of by-gone times 
may reasonably wish later for a true portrayal of the 
real life lived in those times, a portrayal that shall 
have in some degree the like coloring of the strange, 
the remote, and the romantic. Such a biography 
is that by Mr. C. L. Marson, entitled " Hugh, 
Bishop of Lincoln, a Short Story of one of the 
Makers of Mediseval England " (Longmans, Green^ 
& Co.). Devoted as he was to ecclesiasticism and 
veneration of relics, the good bishop, who was the 
terror of three terrible kings, Henry, Richard, and 
John, is interesting for the possession of that strange 
thing in the mediaeval world, a sturdy common- 
sense. This, joined with as sturdy a will, made 
Hugh a man to accomplish things, a man to uphold 
right-living in a time when morality was lax. The 
feeling of the common people that disaster and 
death would at once overtake those whom he ex- 
communicated, and the frequent fulfilment of the 
fear, give striking illustration of the dominant per- 
sonality of the man. The book is written in a 
style that quaintly touches off the nawe simplicity 
of the hero, whether as architect developing the 
early English style, or as ecclesiastical statesman 
checking the too arrogant power of the crown. 
Whether from modesty in thinking that the brief 
hundred and seventy pages of the volume did not 
require it, or from a less commendable reason, th» 
author erred in not providing an index. 



A colossal

Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. are the 
American agents for " The Victoria. 
History of the Counties of England " 
— a publishing enterprise of great dignity and fairly 
colossal scope. Each county is to have from two 
to eight volumes, making in all a series of one 
hundred and sixty. The subscription for this work 
is twelve dollars a volume, which amounts, with a 
discount of ten per cent, to $1728 for the entire 
work. In addition, there will be a supplementary

volume for each county, published at thirty-five 
dollars, containing the pedigrees of the present 
county faoailies, and illustrating the arms of the 
families which are mentioned in the Visitations. A 
specimen volume of the work is now before us — 
being the first of the six treating of the County of 
Norfolk — and bears out all that is claimed by the 
publishers. It is an account of the natural history 
and archaeology of Norfolk, and the chapters are 
the work of eminent specialists. The illustrations 
are numerous, including half a dozen maps and a 
number of full-page plates. Among the matters to 
be dealt with in later volumes are the many phases 
of historical development, heraldry and pedigrees, 
architecture, education, agriculture, and sport. 
Among the departmental editors we note the names 
of Professor W. Boyd Dawkins, Mr. G. Lawrence 
Gomme, Mr. R. L. Poole, and Mr. J. H. Round. 
Mr. H. Arthur Doubleday is the general editor of 
the work. 

It was a happy chance which led 
SpanmMain. ^^- Mowbray Morris to writing his 

" Tales of the Spanish Main " (Mac- 
millan). Between the covers of a single book he 
has brought together nearly all the incidents which 
made Spanish America and the water routes thereto 
the most interesting part of the world for nearly 
two centuries. The voyage of Columbus, with which 
the volume opens, is well told ; but its interest, and 
that of the discovery of the Pacific which succeeds 
it, is soon dimmed by the exploits of that gallant 
band of South Britons, — Drake, Raleigh, Gren- 
ville, and others. The immortal story of " The 
Revenge " is told anew, and will be welcome, for 
all the brilliancy of the writers who have told it 
before. More than a third of the book is occupied 
with the deeds of the bucanneers, ending 'with 
Morgan, the greatest of them all. A final chapter 
might have been added, dealing with the exploits 
of William Walker in Nicaragua, — that curious 
survival of seventeenth century methods in the 
nineteenth century ; but Morgan is a fitting char- 
acter to bring the volume to a climax. These are 
brave stories of brave days, and bravely told. 

The increasing interest felt by Amer-

our new international relations is 
doubtless the occasion for the recent issue of a 
manual on the subject, written by Messrs. George 
G. Wilson, Ph.D., and George F. Tucker, Ph.D., 
and published by Messrs. Silver, Burdett & Co. 
The authors present their work as a " brief intro- 
duction " to the subject ; but it ia of suflBcient ful- 
ness to justify us in calling it a manual. While the 
authors do not attempt any new analysis of their 
subject, its various phases are presented so fully 
and so clearly as to make this one of the most useful 
manuals now in print. The work seems to be 
offered by the compilers primarily for the use of 
students. We regard it as no less useful and inter- 



esting to the general reader, by reason of the easy 
diction employed, and we expect to see it take rank 
as a popular treatise on the general subject. A 
voluminous appendix presents the United States 
Military and Naval Codes of War, the Oxford and 
Brussels Codes of Land Warfare, and other like 
documents, germane to the text.

European Neighbours" (Putnam),

account of " Swiss Life in Town and Country." 
Like its forerunners, this new volume succeeds in 
giving an adequate conception of the manner in 
which the inhabitants of Switzerland, whatever their 
faith or speech, do their duties in this world, and 
takes its readers into places remote from the 
tourist's tread and away from the familiar paths 
of history. There is no phase of the lives of these 
sturdy republicans, whether social or political, 
which Mr. Story does not touch upon, and an 
abundance of illustrations drawn from unhackneyed 
subjects add to the value of the book. The most 
noteworthy aspect of the work will be found in the 
spirit of freedom which vivifies it, the author enter- 
ing fully into the heroism of the daily existence of 
these humble people who govern themselves so ad- 
mirably in spite of threatening nature and of 
neighboring nations committed to monarchical 
policies. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The " Historic Waterways " of Mr. Reuben Gold 
Thwaites, published in 1890, was a charming account 
of a series of canoeing trips down three rivers of Wis- 
consin and Illinois. The work of a pleasing writer, 
who was at the same time a specialist in the history of 
the Northwest, it appealed to the student no less than 
to the casual reader in search of ideas for a summer 
outing, and enjoyed a deserved success. The work has 
now been reissued by Messrs. A, C. MeClurg & Co., 
and is called «« Down Historic Waterways," a slight 
change of title for which there is no evident reason, 
and which librarians will not applaud. Eight photo- 
graphic plates of typical scenery along the rivers des- 
cribed are now added to the work, notably increasing 
its attractiveness. 

Merely to know the story of a play of Shakespeare's 
is not, perhaps, to know much of what Shakespeare has 
to tell us, and yet for various reasons there are doubt- 
less many who will be glad to know so much without 
knowing more. For them " Shakespeare in Tale and 
Verse " (Macmillan), by Mrs. Lois G. HufEord, will 
prove attractive. The book makes no pretense of schol- 
arship, but gives evidence, none the less, of a nicely sure 
understanding of the plays. The stories are told in 
prose, liberally supplemented by quotations from the 
plays; so that the young reader will have the difficul- 
ties cleared away and will at the same time feed on 
many of the nobler lines of the poet. The volume 
contains fifteen of the plays, a fairly adequate number 
for young readers.

Notes. 



Bacon's essay " Of Gardens " is published by Mr. 
John Lane in a pretty pocket volume, with an intro- 
duction by Mrs. Caldwell Crofton. 

" Stories of Country Life," by Miss Sarah Powers 
Bradish, is a volume of «« Eclectic School Readings," 
published by the American Book Co. 

" The Book of the Apple," by Mr. H. H. Thomas, is 
published in the useful series of " Handbooks of Prac- 
tical Gardening," by Mr. John Lane. 

" Lectura y Conversacidn," being " a new and pro- 
gressive Spanish method," by Messrs. T. Silva and A. 
Fourcaut, is published by the American Book Co. 

" Northern Europe " and « The Wide World " are 
two small books in the " Youth's Companion " series of 
school readers for very young children, published by 
Messrs. Ginn & Co. 

" Good Cheer " is the subject of the latest addition 
to the popular little " Nuggets " series, compiled by 
Miss Jeanne G. Pennington and published by Messrs. 
Fords, Howard, & Hulbert. 

The "Virginia" edition of the complete works of 
Edgar Allan Poe, edited by Prof. James A. Harrison 
of the University of Virginia, will be published shortly 
by Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. 

Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night," and "A Dog of 
Flanders " and " The Nurnberg Stove " by " Ouida," 
are the two latest issues in the " Riverside Literature 
Series," published by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 

" Town Life in Ancient Italy," a small book just pub- 
lished by Messrs. B. H. Sanborn & Co., is a translation, 
made by Mr. William E. Waters, of Professor Fried- 
lander's " Stadtewesen in Italien im Erster Jahrhan- 
dert," first published more than twenty years ago. 

" Barry Lyndon," in a single volume, is added to the 
delightful Dent-Macmillan edition of Thackeray's prose 
works, now in course of publication. Mr. Walter Jer- 
rold supplies a bibliographical note to the volume, and 
there are ten of Mr. C. E. Brock's characteristic draw- 
ings. 

The American Book Co. are the publishers of a school 
edition of Caesar's "Commentaries on the Gallic War" 
which leaves nothing to be desired in the way of help- 
ful illustration and apparatus. It is the joint work of 
Professors Albert Harkness and Charles H. Forbes. A 
series of colored plates contributes greatly to the value 
of this text. 

"The Question of the Pacific," published by Mr. 
George F. Lasher, Philadelphia, is an English transla- 
tion of a work by Dr. Victor M. Maurtua, dealing with 
the complicated relations and controversies between 
Chile and Peru. The English version is the work of 
Sefior F. A. Pezet, secretary of the Peruvian Legation 
in Washington. 

" A Political Primer of New York City and State," 
by Miss Adele M. Fielde, is a publication of the New 
York League for Political Education. This little book 
is designed for the information of voters and the mak- 
ing of intelligent citizens, and offers an example of 
practical educational activity that other cities would do 
well to imitate. 

The "Antigone " of Sophocles is soon to be presented 
in the original Greek at the Leland Stanford Junior 
University, and, as the presentation of a Greek tragedy 
has never before been undertaken on the Pacific Coast, 



much interest is manifested in academic and artistic 
circles. It is not unlikely that, in addition to the per- 
formances at the University, a presentation in San 
Francisco will be called for. In scenic arrangements 
the conditions of the ancient theatre will be reproduced 
as nearly as may be, and the choral odes will be sung 
to Mendelssohn's music. 

The " Standard Socialist Series " is a collection of 
small books published by Messrs. Charles H. Kerr & 
Co Three volumes now before us comprise: "The 
American Farmer," by Mr. A. M. Simons ; " Collectivism 
and Industrial Evolution," by M. Emile Vandervelde, 
translated by Mr. C. H. Kerr; and " Karl Marx," bemg 
biographical memoirs by Herr Wilhelm Liebknecht, 
translated by Mr. E. Untermann. 

A second series of Mr. Austin Dobson's "Miscel- 
lanies " is published by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. 
The subjects are mainly from that eighteenth century m 
which Mr. Dobson lives in the spirit, and comprise 
eight "essays and introductions." To these are ap- 
pended nearly a hundred pages of verse, mostly of the 
occasional or votive sort, so that the volume really gives 
us a new collection of Mr. Dobson's ever-welcome and 
ever-graceful poems. 

Attention is again called by the American Historical 
Association to the Justin Winsor prize of one bundred 
dollars, offered annually for a monograph m the field of 
American history. There are practically no limitations 
set upon the choice of subject. About one hundred 
pages of print are required, and the treatment must be 
strictly critical and scientific. Professor Charles M. 
Andrews, Bryn Mawr, Pa., is the proper person to ad- 
dress for information. 

Mr. James FuUarton Muirhead's "America: The 
Land of Contrasts," is republished by Mr. John Lane 
in a second edition, less expensive than was the original 
one. Mr. Muirhead, it will be remembered, is the 
writer of the Baedeker guides to Great Britain and the 
United States, and is thus an expert observer of Amer- 
ican life The book is a valuable commentary upon 
our civilization, kindly in tone, yet not afraid of being 
critical when criticism is called for. 

Mr. Nathan Haskell Dole, Boston, will shortly issue 
for private subscribers a series of diminutive volumes 
to be called "The Breviary Treasures," comprising 
many rare gems of literature. There will be ten vol- 
umes in all, printed on Dutch handmade paper by the 
Riverside Press, and illustrated and decorated under 
the personal direction of Mr. Howard Pyle. Ihe edi- 
tion will be strictly limited to the number of subscrip- 
tions for the complete set received by Mr. Dole up to 
the 15th of this month. 

Among recent revivals of popular old works of fic- 
tion, we note with pleasure a new edition of the histor- 
ical romances of William Harrison Ainsworth. Al- 
though Ainsworth was not one of the masters of this 
form of composition, he knew how to construct an ex- 
cellent story, and was not undeserving of his vogue. 
This new "Windsor" edition bears the imprint of the 
Messrs. Gibbings, and is sold in this country by the J. B. 
Lippincott Co. The volumes are prettily printed and 
illustrated, and will number twenty in all. We^^now 
have on our table two volumes of "Windsor Castle, two 
of " The Tower of London," and one of " St. James s. 

Doctoral theses get printed in various ways. Some- 
times they are books like others, sometimes they are 
publications of the learned societies, sometimes they

are individualistic nondescripts as far as their form of 
issue is concerned. Just now we have in our hands a 
thesis which conaes from the Government Printing Office, 
and is extracted from a report of the Bureau of Amer- 
ican Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution. Its 
subject is ««The Wild Rice Gatherers of the Upper 
Lakes," and it is submitted by Dr. Albert Ernest 
Jenks to the University of Wisconsin. With its gen- 
erous size of page and its numerous photographic plates, 
it presents a rather imposing appearance, and should 
make other candidates for the doctorate emulous of 
this substantial form of publication.

The trip to Salt Lake City, or to the Pacific coast 
via that point over the Denver & Rio Grande and 
the Rio Grande Western is the most beautiful in 
America. No European trip of equal length can 
compare with it in grandeur of scenery or wealth 
of novel interest. Then Salt Lake City itself is 
a most quaint and picturesque place and well 
worth the journey. Its Mormon temple, taber- 
nacle, tithing office and church institutions; its 
hot sulphur springs within the city limits; its 
delightful temperature, sunny climate and its 
Great Salt Lake — deader and denser than the 
Dead Sea in Palestine — are but a few features 
of Salt Lake City's countless attractions. There 
are parks, drives, canons and beautiful outlying 
mountain and lake resorts. Imagine, if you can, 
a bath in salt water a mile above sea level and 
in water in which the human body cannot sink. 
Inquire of your nearest ticket agent for low 
tourist rates to Salt Lake City, or write for 
information and copy of " Salt Lake City, the 
City of the Saints," to S. K. Hooper, general 
passenger agent, Denver, Colo.

The English Exploration of America 

We are living in a new period of expansion and great changes on 
the map of the world, such as there has not been since the sixteenth 
and seventeenth centuries. It is interesting at such a time to look 
back to the period when our forefathers expanded into this New 
World. The following Old South Leaflets have been added to the series : 

"John Cabot's Discovery of North America," "Sir Francis Drake 
on the California Coast," "Frobisher's First Voyage," "Sir Humph- 
rey Gilbert's Expedition to Newfoundland," " Raleigh's First Roa- 
noke Colony," "Gosnold's Settlement at Cuttyhunk," "Captain John 
Smith's Description of New England," and "Richard Hakluyt's Dis- 
course on Western Planting." 

These leaflets are Nos. 115-122 in the Old South series, which is 
now 80 large. They are made up from original documents of the 
period, and are all accompanied by careful historical and bibliograph- 
ical notes. Sold for five cents a copy, they place at the service of the 
schools and the public a most important mass of historical papers not 
otherwise easily accessible.

" It is no exaggeration to say that no man living is better qualified to write upon these and kindred topics than the

profound learning, and scrupulous fairness and impartiality that have given Mr. Bryce's previous works such remarkable

— Philadelphia Public Ledger. 

" A good deal more than a bundle of clever satires — 
fantasies upon persons and things musical. Witty and 
alluring to a degree sometimes extraordinary, hinting at 
a knowledge of music, literature, and the plastic arts no

MODERN SCANDINAVIAN LITERATURE. By Dr. Georg Brandes. A new volume in the 
Literatures of the World Series, edited by Edmund Gosse. 12mo. Cloth, $1.20 net ; postage, 
12 cts. additional. 

npHE name of the distinguished Danish critic who is the author of this volume is a guarantee of wealth of 
knowledge, breadth of view, and critical acumen. His subject has gained greatly in immediate consequence 
of recent years, even from a purely popular point of view. The increased interest in northern folklore, the study 
«f the Icelandic sagas and eddas, the greater attention given to sources and influences, and in our own time the 
position and influence of writers like Brandes, Ibsen, and Bjornson, are readily suggested as among the reasons for 
the wide interest in the subject. The evolution of the poetry of the north, and the varying phases of literary 
expression in Iceland, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, are sketched in this volume by one who is himself an 
important part of modern Scandinavian literature. In this admirable critical and historical summary Dr. Brandes 
^ves a comprehensive view of a rich and fascinating field, with special reference to modern literature. It is 
believed that this essay fills a place heretofore unoccupied.

OERMAN-AND-ENGLISH AND ENGLISH-AND-GERMAN DICTIONARY. By G. J. Adler. 

"THE new edition of Adler's German-English and English-German Dictionary is a thorough revision of a standard 
work. When the book was originally issued it was the best of its kind in existence, and it long maintained 
its place as such. But every living language grows, and the time came when some words had become obsolete, 
others had acquired new meanings, and still others had come into existence. Hence the revision, which is the 
work of three editors of wide experience. The dictionary is larger than before, and every page has been reset 
in new type.

THE FUNCTION OF THE NEGRO 
COLLEGE. 



There is at the present time so widespread a 
discouragement of the higher education of 
colored youth, that it might seem absurd to 
discuss the contents of a curriculum the wis- 
dom of whose very existence is seriously called 
in queston. One is reminded of Stanley's men 
in the forests of Africa, who, when threatened 
with starvation, amused themselves by com- 
posing fancy bills-of-fare containing choice Eu- 
ropean viands. 

In proposing a scheme of education for the 
Negro, we should mainly consider (1) the edu- 
cational constants which admit of no variation 
on account of ethnic peculiarities, and (2) the 
aptitude and social situation of the class pre- 
scribed for. The ground-work of education 
cannot be modified to meet the variant de- 
mands of race or color, previous conditions or 
present needs. The general processes of dis- 
cipline and culture must form a fixed and un- 
alterable part of any adequate educational pro- 
gramme. On the other hand, there is quite a 
wide latitude of accommodation for special 
needs and social circumstances in what might 
be called the practical aspect of education. 
There has recently sprung up a class of edu- 
cational philosophers who would restrict the 
term " practical education " to those forms of 
knowledge or formulas of information which 
can be converted into cash equivalent on de- 
mand. The truth is, that all knowledge which 
enables the recipient to do with added effi- 
ciency the work which falls to his lot in this 
world, whether that work be tilling the soil or 
plying a handicraft, healing the sick or enlight- 
ening the ignorant, uplifting the lowly or ad- 
ministering spiritual solace, is " practical " in 
the highest and best significance of that term. 

In an ideal system of education, no two per- 
sons would receive identical treatment. There 
is always a wide margin of individual aptitude 
or predilection. It is no disparagement of any 
class to say that its needs differ from those of 
another class. The curricula of our Negro 
colleges were taken bodily from the best New 
England schools of thirty years ago ; and in 
view of the fact that these prototypes have been 
radically modified by the urgency of present 



268 



THE DIAL 



[April 16, 



day demands, it ought not to be surprising if 
they prove for the Negro to be a slight mis-fit. 
The trend of educational tendency is more and 
more toward the practical things of the pres- 
ent. The introduction of the elective system 
(has been influenced mainly by this motive. 
The wisely directed youth pursues his academic 
course with direct reference to the end in view, 
as steadily as the hunter keeps his sight level 
on his game. Traditional branches of study 
have lost much of their talismanic value. The 
so-called higher education is no longer con- 
fined to the classic tongues of two famous far- 
off peoples. The pedagogical watch-word is 
method rather than subject-matter. The higher 
method of inquiry and investigation can be ap- 
plied to the growing roots of living plants as 
well as to the dry stems of a dead language. 
The problems growing out of the population of 
Alabama or Florida are as intricate in their re- 
lation and as far-reaching in their consequence, 
and, withal, as important a subject for study, 
as any ever involved in the European penin- 
sulas. 

Courses of study intended for colored stu- 
dents should be interpretable in terms of their 
needs and obvious mission. The chief function 
of the educated Negro is to disseminate knowl- 
edge, in simplified form, among the masses of 
his race. Productive scholarship will hardly 
■fall to his lot for many generations to come. 
This is not said in disparagement of his ability, 
but because of his limited range of opportu- 
nity, and his proscriptive circumstances. Schol- 
arship thrives by social stimulus, leisure, 
cultivated contact, or affiliation with great in- 
«titutions. None of these conditions applies 
to the Negro at the present time. No one can 
■doubt that there are individual members of the 
•colored race who take rank with the best Aryan 
youth according to any approved test of capa- 
city. But when the two take their respective 
places in society, they go up and down on the 
scale of opportunity, as two figures of equal 
intrinsic value gain or lose in power by their 
local setting on different sides of the separatrix 
in the decimal notation. The educated Negro 
youth, then, is not to explore, but to interpret 
and apply. He must partake of the mysteries 
of knowledge, and show them unto the masses 
in such simple forms as they can understand 
and utilize. But if this is to be the chief mis- 
sion of the educated Negro, why waste time 
and money in initiating him in " the traditional 
culture of the Aryan race " ? It is well known 
that in order to interpret a formula to others. 



one must have a knowledge of its underlying 
principles as well as a practical facility of 
manipulation. It is conceivable that a sea 
captain might be able to determine the bear- 
ings of his ship, without understanding the 
mathematical mysteries of astronomy and 
geodesy ; but he would make a very poor 
teacher of the principles of navigation. The 
attempt to apply formulas without basal knowl- 
edge leads to the embarrassment of the ship's 
captain who was also ambitious to play the 
role of physician. He carried on his voyage 
a medical chest filled with drugs to be admin- 
istered by number according to well-known 
symptomatic indications. The complaint of 
a sailor called clearly for No. 15 ; but that 
drug being exhausted, the good captain ad- 
ministered a compound of Nos. 7 and 8, with 
the result that the patient died. 

It is especially dangerous to equip members 
of a backward race with the forms and ter- 
minology of a higher civilization, and send 
them forth as guides and philosophers of the 
masses. There is a lack of that steadiness 
and poise which come from heredity and the 
sobering influence of rational environment. 
The result is apt to be sham shallowness and 
showy pretence. The blind led by the blind 
are, to say the least, as fortunate as the 
blind led by the bigoted. The writer has seen 
a circular issued by a young man, scarcely 
thirty years of age, the sum total of whose 
knowledge would be scarcely equal to that of 
a Yale sophomore, who advertises himself as 

Rev. , A.M., B.D., Ph.D., D.D. It is 

more than likely that the majority of the con- 
gregation of this over-bedecked preacher can 
neither read nor write. What these humble 
people need is sound knowledge and simple 
sense. 

The social separation of the races in Amer- 
ica renders it imperative that the professional 
classes among the Negroes should be recruited 
from their own ranks. Under ordinary cir- 
cumstances, professional places are filled by 
the most favored members of the most favored 
class in the community. In a Latin or Cath- 
olic country, where the fiction of " social equal- 
ity " does not exist, there is felt no necessity 
for Negro priest, teacher, or physician, to ad- 
minister to his own race. But in America 
this is conceded to be a social necessity. Such 
being the case, the Negro leader, to use a 
familiar term, requires all the professional 
equipment of his white confrere, and a special 
knowledge of the needs and circumstances of 



1902.J 



THE DIAL 



269 



his race in addition. The teacher of the 
Negro child, the preacher of a Negro congre- 
gation, or the physician to Negro patients, 
certainly require as much professional knowl- 
edge and skill as those who administer to the 
corresponding needs of the white race. Nor 
are the i-equirements of the situation one whit 
diminished because the bestower is of the same 
race as the recipient. 

Those who argue that the money and effort 
already bestowed upon the higher education of 
the Negro have been wasted, not only shut 
their eyes to the value of demonstrated results, 
but show a shallow knowledge of sociological 
exactions. 

For professional needs alone, the situation 
calls for at least one well-educated person in 
every two hundred of the Negro population. 
There is no provision whereby these persons 
can be qualified for their function except 
through the much-abused Negro college. The 
mere rudiments of knowledge and practical 
handicraft, as useful as these are in their place 
and for their purpose, cannot qualify the re- 
cipient for the higher function, which is of 
equal, or rather of superior, importance. 

The curriculum of the Negro college should 
embrace those subjects which lead (1) to dis- 
cipline, (2) to culture, and (3) to a knowl- 
edge of the facts and factors of racial life. 
The two main points of variance from the 
ordinary curriculum should be the inclusion of 
racial knowledge and the practical exclusion 
of speculative branches. One need not be a 
disciple of Auguste Comte, with a one-sided 
leaning to things positive, to appreciate the 
fact that such subtle subjects, for lack of defi- 
nite setting and statement, are apt to bewilder 
and confuse rather than to simplify and eluci- 
date. They lead too far away from the lowly 
life of the masses, in terms of which all useful 
knowledge must be interpretable. Negro 
youth need training in exactitude of thought. 
No one who is acquainted with the race can 
fail to be impressed with its loose and slovenly 
modes of reasoning. The fanciful and flighty, 
the ornate and extravagant, are given prefer- 
ence over the straightforward and direct. 
This erratic tendency can be corrected, to a 
great extent, by the rigid discipline of the ele- 
mentary mathematics, which demand a simple, 
straightforward, candid, unwavering method 
of procedure in order to reach the required 
result. What has been said about habits of 
thought will apply also to plans and methods 
of work, — or, better still, to ways of handling 



things. The Negro has never engaged in pur- 
suits that demanded nice adaptation of means 
to ends. His methods, therefore, are awkward 
and clumsy. The Negro workman is regarded 
as simply " a hand," — neither the intellect nor 
the sensibilities nor the will being demanded 
in the accomplishment of his crude task. 
Hence, a form of training which requires the 
cooperation of bodily and mental faculties be- 
comes a prime prerequisite. The value of 
such training, it will be conceived, is wholly 
indifferent to the special vocation which the 
student may follow in after life. For science, 
method, and skill are equally demanded in all 
callings if one would gain efficiency and suc- 
cess. Herein consists the strong argument 
for industrial education. But the laboratory 
method, which has been introduced in almost 
every department of science, has robbed so- 
called industrial training of much of its exclu- 
sive educational value. Work in wood and 
iron and in the mechanical trades furnishes by 
no means the only facility of dealing with con- 
crete problems, or of applying thought to 
things. A course in chemistry requires as 
much deftness as a course in carpentry. In 
botany, zooolgy, and physics, the student works 
out results according to formulated plan as 
surely as does the mechanic in a machine-shop. 
The Negro college, then, needs to lay added 
stress upon the scientific side of the work. 
This is the weak spot in most of such institu- 
tions. 

Rational enjoyment through moderation is 
perhaps as good a definition as can be given 
of " culture." The Negro race is characterized 
by boisterousness of manners and extravagant 
forms of taste. As if to correct such deficien- 
cies, their higher education hitherto has been 
largely concerned with Greek and Latin liter- 
ature, the norms of modern culture. The ad- 
vanced Negro student became acquainted with 
Homer and Virgil before he had read Shakes- 
peare and Milton. It is just here that our edu- 
cational critics are apt to become excited. The 
spectacle of a Negro wearing eye-glasses, and 
declaiming in classic phases about " The walls 
of lofty Rome " and " The wrath of Achilles," 
upsets their critical balance and composure. 
We have so often listened to the grotesque 
incongruity of a Greek chorus and a greasy 
cabin, and the relative value of a piano and a 
patch of potatoes, that if we did not join in the 
smile in order to encourage the humor, we 
should do so out of sheer weariness. 

And yet we dare affirm that the study of 



270 



THE DIAL 



[April 16, 



Latin and Greek has had a wholesome influ- 
ence in starting lofty ideals and stimulating 
noble aspiration among the Negro peoples. Of 
course, Negro schools must share in the gen- 
eral relative decline of classic studies. But it 
would be a sad day for the race if its youth 
were shut out from the treasury of cultural 
wealth contained in the storehouse of classical 
literature. 

While the Negro college has many features 
in common with the academic world in general, 
its chief distinctive function is to direct and 
dominate the higher life of the race. The Negro 
is in a peculiar sense dependent upon the school 
for the higher forms and nobler modes of life. 
The school is, or has been, well-nigh the only 
diffusive source of light. The curriculum, 
therefore, should be concerned largely with the 
conditions of that life whose destiny it is its 
chief function to influence. These colleges 
should be centres of social knowledge, where 
men of consecration and of sound discernment 
should speak the word needful with such sim- 
plicity and sense that the people would hear 
them gladly. This would be in no sense a 
derogation of academic dignity ; for knowledge 
which ultimates in social service reaches its 
highest effective level. 

Sociology is fast becoming a staple part of 
our college curricula. The Negro problem just 
now is of supreme sociological importance. Dr. 
Alderman, in a recent number of " The Out- 
look," has set forth with much point and pith 
the value of this branch of study to the white 
youth of the South. What was there said con- 
cerning the importance of this subject to South- 
ern white youth applies also, or rather all the 
more, to Negro youth. Of course we cannot fol- 
low Dr. Alderman when he says that the edu- 
cation of one white man is worth more to the 
Negro race than the education of ten blacks, — 
any more than we should agree with the asser- 
tion that the feeding and clothing of one white 
man is of more importance to the Negro than 
like benefits bestowed upon a dozen members of 
his own race. To put the proposition in a con- 
crete form, it devolves upon Dr. Alderman to 
point out any particular white man whose 
scholastic training would be worth more to 
the Negro race than that of E. R. Wright or 
W. E. B. DuBois. 

Every Negro who assumes leadership has to 
deal with vital sociological questions. Those 
who must direct others along lines of civic duty 
and social righteousness should have some 
formal training as to the factors with which 



they must deal. Atlanta University, through 
its chair of sociology and the publications pro- 
ceeding from its annual conferences, is meeting 
this requirement in a commendable measure. 
Aside from this, and some simple sociological 
work recently inaugurated at Howard Uni- 
versity, there seem to be no other Negro col- 
leges working along these lines. The motto 
inscribed over the entrance to the temple at 
Delphi conveys a special meaning to the Negro 
student of the present day — " Know Thyself." 
The true principle of education would carry 
the pupil outside of himself and the narrow 
circle of selfish interests to the contemplation 
of questions of universal import and world- 
wide consequence ; on the other hand, he should 
not be allowed to roam so far a-field that he 
cannot be instantly recalled, if need be, to the 
things that appertain to his own environment. 
The curricula of Negro colleges should pre- 
serve a just balance between these principles.

THE LO ST TE ACHER. 

Are we so method-mad that we are beginning to 
leave out the personal equation in our educational 
problem? Or is there really no place in our hard 
and elaborate system for aught except machinery ? 

Where are our great teachers? Where can we 
find the light, the force, the blood, the spirit, the at- 
mosphere, which those of us who have reached ma- 
ture years remember so well from our early school 
experiences ? This was the true individualism in ed- 
ucation, — not the kind that you may dig up out of 
the desert of a text-book, or from the cant phrase, 
growing more inconsequent at every repetition, that 
you hear tossed from the lips of one educator to 
another. 

These were the makers of men. You cannot 
go anywhere in English history without meeting 
them. They show against the horizon figures as 
clear-cut as poet, or statesman, or fighting man. 
You turn over the old pages and come across the 
old Homeric pictures that put heart into us all : 
Bede, and Wycliffe, and Ascham, and many an- 
other both wise and gentle ; Thomas Arnold, stand- 
ing in the dusk of Rugby chapel, a throng of young 
faces upturned toward him ; Edward Benson, bid- 
ding farewell to his soldiers' sons in the gloom of 
a rainy autumn afternoon ; Dr. Coit, churchman, 
scholar, gentleman ; Dr. McCosh, that large-fibred, 
fiery soul, the glory and the crown of Princeton. 

The slovenly and indefinite cannot compass suc- 
cess, and therefore it is certain that these men did 
not approach their teaching in a haphazard fashion ; 
yet, whatever method or system they employed was 



1902.]

subservient to their own personality, and behind 
each method glowed the aagast and militant soul 
of the master. Their deepest interests were not 
with things but with humanity. 

Such a man, teaching history, shall deliver an 
apostolic message to his pupils. The story of a race 
shall be to them a large rendering of the story of 
life ; and literature, with its subtleties and poetries 
of an ampler speech, and with its clarity of vision, 
shall be a re-telling of the narrative. And each daily 
task shall prove itself to be made of the same stuff 
out of which are woven the divine toils of heaven. 

We follow men, not things. Life is first of all a 
question of teachers. It deals elementally, not with 
a series of mental processes by which certain data 
are stored in the mind, but with the great fact of 
character, with those myriad delicate yet virile sub- 
stances that reach out and grasp the immortal man. 
Vital contact with life, with the world, in other 
words, with those teeming forces that tend to cre- 
ate a robust man or woman, is the chief necessity 
of maturing youth. Set such a robust personality 
before it, and it will recognize a leader, a warm, 
strong presence, to which it may bring its aspira- 
tions and inspirations, and to which, in other and 
harder years, it shall be indebted for a regenerating 
influence. 

Are text-books, and summer courses, and peda- 
gogical pamphlets and methods, to be pushed to the 
front, and the teacher to the rear ? Are our schools, 
public and private, our conventions both state and 
national, to discuss papers on spelling, and papers 
on geography, and papers on mathematics, with 
theory upon theory concerning the whole curric- 
ulum of study, and be void of one sound, whole- 
some, downright word in regard to what is above 
and beyond all these? 

Drill, routine, mental adroitness, photographic 
attention to detail, are serviceable things in their 
way, and he who fails to recognize their value takes 
but a parochial view of education ; yet none of these 
strikes at the heart of the matter. It is personality 
that does this ; for that only can guide, lead, and 
control. A machine, expert though it be, has the 
defects of machinery. Through some cog, or crank, 
or wheel within a wheel, through the little more or 
the little less in its multitudinous wires and coils, 
it may prove both inexorable and ineffectual in a 
moment of direst need. But character remains. 
The beginning and the end of education is the 



teacher.

The Hero of Al,iwal.» 



In the " Book of Snobs," at the close of the 
chapter on Military Snobs, occur these words : 
" Let those civilians who sneer at the acquire- 
ments of the Army read Sir Harry Smith's 
account of the Battle of Aliwal. A noble 
deed was never told in nobler language. . . . 
The men who perform these deeds with such 
brilliant valour, and describe them with such 
modest manliness — such are not Snobs. Their 
country admires them, their Sovereign re- 
wards them, and launch, the universal railer, 
takes off his hat and says, Heaven save 
them ! " 

The relief of Ladysmith, two years or more 
ago, made the world familiar with the name at 
least of Lady Juana Smith, and with that of 
her husband, Sir Harry Smith, whose name 
and fame are also commemorated in the South 
African town of Harrismith. Henry George 
Wakelyn Smith — we spare the reader a 
string of details and squeeze a life of seventy- 
three years into a single sentence — was born 
in 1787 (incorrectly given in the biographical 
dictionaries as 1788), early entered the army, 
served in South America, Spain, the United 
States, at Waterloo, in Jamaica, Ireland, South 
Africa, India, and closed his active career as 
governor of Cape Colony, dying in 1860, eight 
years after his return to England. 

The Autobiography, just published in two 
large volumes, comes down only to 1846, but 
is supplemented by letters and diaries, and by 
the narrative of the editor, Sir Harry's grand- 
nephew. The old soldier tells his story with 
much of the dash and fire that marked his 
onslaughts on an enemy's position. There are 
no flowers of rhetoric, and yet one suspects it 
is not always a plain, unvarnished tale he sets 
before the reader. The editor says, however, 
that it was the writer's purpose to supply ma- 
terial for some novelist — probably Charles 
Lever — to work up in the form of romance. 
A nibble here and there at Sir Harry's not 
over-bashful account of his exploits will give 
us a mental picture of the man. Speaking of 
his Peninsular campaign of 1810, when he was

to me in great distress. < O mein Gott, upstand and 
jump up your horse; she will surely be here directly ! ' 
I was half asleep, with my horse's reins in my hand, 
and roared out, * Who the devil is she f ' * The Fran- 
zosen, mein Herr. Two d — d schelms have deserted.' 
... At daylight we saw fifty French dragoons wend- 
ing their way on the opposite bank to the ford. I 
immediately got hold of the padre and alcalde (priest 
and magistrate), and made them collect a hundred vil- 
lagers and make them shoulder the long sticks with 
which they drive their bullock-carts and ploughs, which 
of course at a distance would resemble bayonets. These 
villagers I stationed in two parties behind two hills, so 
that the ' bayonets ' alone could be seen by the enemy. 
. . . The enemy were deceived and rapidly retired, 
and I saved the village from an unmerciful ransacking, 
to the joy of all the poor people." 

In an assault on Ciudad Rodrigo, young 
Smith, who was of dark complexion and slight 
build, was mistaken for a Frenchman by a 
fellow-soldier, a " big, thundering grenadier," 
who seized him by the throat like a kitten and 
would have ended his career then and there 
had not poor Harry found breath enough to 
gasp out a vigorous Anglo-Saxon oath, which 
saved his life. A bit of romance relieves the 
horrors of the slaughter at Badajos. A young 
girl of noble blood, Juana Maria de los Dolores 
de Leon, fled with an elder sister to the En- 
glish camp, seeking refuge from the lawless 
soldiery. Young Smith was fired with love at 
the sight of beauty in distress ; he took the 
girl under his protection, won her heart, and 
ere long married her. The union was crowned 
with happiness, though unblessed with off- 
spring. In recalling this first meeting with the 
lovely Juana, her soldier-husband waxes dithy- 
rambic, and his passion runs away with his syn- 
tax — to the infinite credit of his honest heart. 

Of the taking of Washington by the British, 
in 1814, we read : 

" Suffice it to say we licked the Yankees and took all 
their guns, with a loss of upwards of 300 men . . . 
and we entered Washington for the barbarous purpose 
of destroying the city. Admiral Cockburn would have 
burnt the whole, but Ross would only consent to the 
burning of the public buildings. I had no objection to 
burn arsenals, dockyards, frigates building, stores, bar- 
racks, etc., but we were horrified at the order to burn 
the elegant Houses of Parliament and the President's 
house. ... I shall never forget the destructive maj- 
esty of the flames as the torches were applied to beds, 
-curtains, etc. Our sailors were artists at the work." 



Harry Smith's famous ride, on the outbreak 
of the Kaffir war of 1835, from Cape Town to 
Graham's Town, — 700 miles in six days, over 
a rough and roadless country, — is still remem- 
bered. Eleven years later his brilliant charge 
against the Sikhs, at the battle of Aliwal, 
brought him his baronetcy and the grand cross 
of the Bath, and led to his appointment as 
governor of Cape Colony. His removal thence 
by Lord Grey for alleged inefficiency in sup- 
pressing Kaffir hostilities was attended with 
circumstances most trying to a man of spirit ; 
but he met the bitterness of recall with a 
magnanimity worthy of all praise. His old 
master in war, the Duke of Wellington, 
openly defended him in the House of Lords, 
and the people stood by him. Returning to 
London, he met the colonial secretary with 
a fine resolve not to pose as a man with a 
grievance. 

In our estimate of his character as revealed 
in his Autobiography, we can well believe, 
with his kinsman and editor, that his faults 
were those of a generous nature unwilling to 
suspect evil in others. His impetuosity, his 
warmth of language under provocation, his 
disregard of the value of money, and his touch 
of bravado, only endear him the more to the 
reader. His horror of the cruelties of war 
finds frequent expression. " Civilized man," 
he says, " when let loosiB and the bonds of 
morality relaxed, is a far greater beast than 
the savage, more refined in his cruelty, more 
fiend-like in every act " ; and again, almost in 
Sherman's well-known words, " The seat of 
war is hell upon earth." But there is some- 
thing smile-provoking in the following refer- 
ence to British losses at Aliwal : " Human life 
once extinct is in this world gone, and how 
gratifying it is under Divine Providence to 
feel that not a soldier under my command was 
wantonly, unnecessarily, or unscientifically 
sacrificed to his country ! " 

Walter Bagehot's complaint that so few 
good books are written because " an author's 
life is a vacuum," finds no support in Sir 
Harry Smith's stirring chronicle. A mass of 
military detail, often tiresome to a civilian, it 
certainly contains, but of padding and book- 
making no remotest reminder. The parts re- 
lating to South Africa are perhaps most per- 
tinent to the times, and will call forth reflections 
concerning British colonial policy, from which 
we here refrain.

Student, College, and Character.* 

The college student is a perennially inter- 
esting individual. His microcosm, in which 
he disports himself according to time-honored 
traditions and privileges, oiBfers an entertaining 
spectacle alike from the auditorium and from 
the stage. There is a recognizable sameness 
about it all, as there is about many of the 
things of life that grow out of the inherent 
human traits pertaining to any of the seven 
ages of man. College generations pass rather 
quickly, and the alumnus of a dozen years' 
standing, on revisiting his alma mater, feels 
that the student of to-day is of a generation 
that knew not Joseph and is equally innocent 
of many other of the things that for him re- 
main the permanent possession of his college 
life. If the alumnus becomes a professor, or 
for any other reason remains in touch with the 
evolving conditions of college affairs, he ob- 
tains a wider and more intimate view of things, 
and sees useful growth with gains and losses, 
wider opportunities, and possibly less enthu- 
siasm or stimulus in their pursuit. For the pro- 
fessional student of students, and for the en- 
couragingly large portion of the public that 
takes a real and helpful interest in the problems 
which professional educators have to meet, as 
well as for the student himself, it is natural and 
proper that a literature should be offered set- 
ting forth the wisdom of experience, the advo- 
cacy of reform, the goal of endeavor, the de- 
sirability of newer and truer ideals. 

In the group of volumes that form a chance 
acquaintance upon the reviewer's table we find 
the genial and realistic reflections of the Dean 
of Harvard, the somewhat paternal counsel of 
a former college president, the professional 
contribution of a student of education, the 
practical conclusions of a physician who is at 
once guide, philosopher, and friend, and the 
thoughtful appeal of one who combines with 
technical training in science the zeal of a social 
reformer and the inspirational forcefulness of 
a high-minded idealist. It may well be that

these various contributions, in spite of their 
differences of motive and design, reflect a 
common interest in the trends of present-day 
education, and so meet on common ground. 
They have at all events a sufficient community 
of content and import to warrant a composite 
notice. 

The most objective of the volumes is that of 
Professor Sheldon, whose work forms one of 
the well known series of books on educational 
topics edited by Mr. W. T. Harris. Here the 
student is presented and described as to genus 
and species and habitat and manner of life. 
From his appearance in the universities of 
medieval Europe, through the further differ- 
entiation of those institutions in fulfilment of 
various national characters and fortunes, to his 
transplantation on American soil, first as de- 
pendent on home traditions, and then as a 
member of more independent foundations, the 
origin of the American college student is 
traced and the varieties of his likeness and 
unlikeness to his European cousins set forth. 
In the main, the American student is the hero 
of the play, and remains on the stage through 
all but the earlier chapters. All of his char- 
acteristic institutions are described, — his class 
system, his debating societies, his fraternities, 
his athletics, his social, literary, religious, and 
other organizations. He is, indeed, a member 
of a complicated body politic, and has his trials 
and tribulations, his conflicts with authority, 
and his occasions for the display of valor and 
proficiency. Strange to say, coeducation is 
almost entirely ignored. This kind of infor- 
mation in regard to the college student has not 
been conveniently available before, and it 
is fortunate that it has now been made so. 
Yet the story is by no means a mere narra- 
tive. It contains instructive incidents, some 
amusing, others rather discouraging, yet in 
the main helpful and significant. The stu- 
dent cannot be successfully dealt with with- 
out understanding his nature ; and a knowledge 
of what he has been in former days and 
what his interests are today is indispens- 
able to a right direction of his wholesome 
impulses and the successful encounter with 
his more alarming frailties. Mr. Sheldon's 
judicial review of the facts of the case may 
prevent theorizing on false basis, and may 
prove serviceable to the student of educational 
tendencies. 

Dean Briggs has collected a few of the at- 
tractive essays which he has lately contributed 
to the pages of the " Atlantic Monthly " and

to other periodicals in a volume well entitled, 
" School, College, and Character." The tone 
of the volume is as thoroughly sound as it is 
agreeable and sincere. The author takes us 
into his confidence and reveals the sidelights 
of a Dean's professional experiences. He mod- 
estly tells us that his book is " not a full or- 
chestra, but a harp with two strings, which the 
harper twangs as long as the audience will put 
up with him." Yet he produces far more 
pleasing effects with simple means than the 
more ambitious but less skilful performer on a 
more complicated instrument. The tunes that 
he plays have some life to them, and, it is hoped, 
will not pass in at one ear and out at the other. 
Educators are apt to make too much of the 
technique of their profession, with a conse- 
quent wearying shop-talk when they come 
together. It is the vitalizing touch of a man 
who observes with keen vision and a deeply 
human interest that sparkles in Mr. Briggs's 
pages. " Fathers, Mothers, and Freshmen " 
will be equally benefitted by reading the whole 
volume and not alone the essay devoted to 
them more particularly. " College Honor " 
offers a fertile theme, and its irrational vaga- 
ries are well portrayed. The whole volume 
suggests the growing attention which is being 
given to the moral purpose of education, and 
therein lies the specific value of what Dean 
Briggs has to say. 

Mr. Canfield, now Librarian of Columbia 
University, writes the first volume of a " Per- 
sonal Problem Series " which the publishers 
introduce with the purpose of doing for pres- 
ent-day needs what the unreadable books of 
counsel of many decades ago presumably ac- 
complished for their own more serious and less 
distracted generation. This is a most delicate 
task. That young people need both advice 
and influence no one will deny ; and he who 
finds within himself the call to that function 
enlists his energies in a righteous cause. Yet 
there is a large amount of ineffective preach- 
ing done, and publishers do not clamor for 
sermons wherewith to add attraction to their 
" announcements." There is doubtless a con- 
siderable body of young men and women who 
might profit by the things that Mr. Canfield 
has set down for their benefit ; and if they 
chance to read his pages, which is about as 
likely as that the persons who need the sermon 
will be part of the congregation, his efforts 
will not be in vain. And yet, without dispar- 
aging unduly a worthy effort, it must be con- 
fessed that no great expectations can be aroused 



by this type of advice and exhortation. Many 
young men and young women will resent this 
form of counsel, as assuming on their part an 
ignorance and immaturity which may occur, 
but is hardly typical ; others will resent the 
persistency of the guidance which is offered, 
and turn, as they would in life, to some more 
attractive form of encouragement that leads 
and does not drive. Mr. Canfield's book im- 
.presses one as the work of a capable student 
who has set himself a task for which his temper- 
ament is not suited. One is tempted to recall 
the comment of a rustic sage upon the address 
of a successful politician. He admitted the 
excellence of the address, and that the man 
was a good speaker ; yet he added that a bet- 
ter speaker would have given that speech differ- 
ently, and a really great speaker would not 
have made the speech at all. 

Dr. Oppenheim's book is the second volume 
of the same series, and has a similar purpose. 
The author is favorably known for his contri- 
butions to the psychology and physiology of 
childhood, and has been particularly fortunate 
in the composition and the leading motifs of 
what he has chosen to say. He seems to come 
easily and naturally by the gift of pertinent 
counsel, and rarely commits the fault of over- 
doing good advice. His self-restraint and 
reserve in keeping a tempting subject from 
overflowing its natural boundaries adds to the 
judicious poise of his several chapters. Dr. 
Oppenheim gives his readers some sujBficiently 
definite and equally elastic principles for the 
guidance of the intellectual life, and the vic- 
tory over self without which true success is 
conspicuously defective. He preaches well 
and to the point, and is likely to hold his 
hearers. He has no system to defend, no me- 
chanical routine that leads to success, but well- 
expressed principles based on well-established 
foundations. If one reflects upon the vast 
amount of foolish schemes for securing the 
good things of life that are scattered broad- 
cast over this supposedly enlightened land, and 
compares the total mass of these with the small 
output of wholesome and rational attempts to 
formulate, for those who need it and can profit 
by it, some of the essential rules for setting the 
compass of life and keeping the craft in sea- 
worthy condition, one is naturally disposed to 
exaggerate the value of a book like this. It is 
a readable, capable, and timely essay, with a 
theme vital to all who are not too old or too 
depraved to improve. 

Mr. Henderson's book is more profound,

more thoughtful, and more ambitious than any 
of the others. It is likewise more difficult to 
reproduce in spirit or content. Its main value 
lies in its sincere and inspiring idealism. How- 
ever closely we may sympathize or however 
widely differ from the views which the author 
sets forth, the sympathy with his zeal, his 
unusual insight, his enthusiasm for an ideal 
democracy of opportunity, and with his able 
expression of his ideals, will always remain to 
right-minded readers. It is in many ways a 
notable book. Mr. Henderson protests against 
many of the things that we do in the name of 
education, and bemoans the neglect of many of 
the things that we leave undone. His stock- 
taking of the valuable possessions of human- 
ity, and in particular of the American people, 
is not likely to encourage the advocates of a 
triumphant spread-eagle democracy. Many of 
the most serious efforts of mankind are to Mr. 
Henderson appalling and systematic wastes of 
time. He does not enthuse over the ability to 
shout the price of pork from Chicago to New 
York, or the making of ten bad pieces of fur- 
niture in Grand Rapids in the same time that 
it took to make one good piece a hundred years 
ago. We fail to measure aright the good 
things of life because we fail to apply the 
right standards. Human power, human hap- 
piness may or may not be advanced by what 
we are pleased to speak of as improvements. 
And the application of all this to the problems 
of education is quite direct ; for the purpose 
of education, when interpreted by these prin- 
ciples, is nothing less than the guidance of life 
in all its aspects, the establishment of the social 
purpose of humanity. It would, however, be a 
pity to mar the profit or the enjoyment of this 
volume to the prospective reader by attempt- 
ing to reproduce its message. Mr. Henderson 
writes as one with a vital message, and with 
the power to plead his cause powerfully, sin- 
cerely, effectively. It is a good thing, — it 
is often an epoch-making thing, — for a na- 
tion or an individual to revise its creed of ex- 
perience, to shake or strengthen its traditional 
convictions. It is no small service to be able 
to effect this or to set the ferment in motion. 
For many minds this is just what Mr. Hender- 
son's volume may accomplish. We are all more 
or less in the woods, and fail to see the forest 
for the trees. A helpful shout from a kindly 
fellow-traveller may restore confidence in the 
way we have chosen, or lead us to consider a 
change of route before it is too late.

Education and Politics.* 

It must be confessed that the title of Presi- 
dent Hadley's collection of essays is a most 
appropriate one. It would be difficult to find 
a title which would more satisfactorily char- 
acterize the volume, made up as it is of dis- 
cussions relating to economics, politics, ethics, 
political education, higher education, and 
school education. These essays furnish many 
examples of Mr. Hadley's ability to present 
strong thought in a clear and forcible manner. 
The first paper, on "The Demands of the 
Twentieth Century," furnishes the means for 
comparing the opportunity which lies before 
the American citizen of to-day with that which 
confronted the Puritans. The point of com- 
parison is an apt one. Shall the next gener- 
ation do its work in the spirit of the adven- 
turer, or in the spirit of the Puritan? Perhaps 
no one else has shown more clearly the situa- 
tion as it exists to-day in reference to the 
standards of political morality, as compared 
with those of personal morality and commer- 
cial morality. The low standards of political 
morality are represented as due to defect in 
public judgment rather than to weakness in 
individual character. In other words, we are 
ignorant of the particular virtues, the exer- 
cise of which will secure the proper develop- 
ment of organized society. The time should 
come, and doubtless will come, when a country 
like ours will attain that conception of public 
attitude which is inspired by a sense of moral 
obligation rather than one bound by legality 
alone. 

Mr. Hadley's discussion of the power of 
public sentiment is particularly discriminating. 
It is not necessarily true that there is a public 
sentimient in favor of a particular thing be- 
cause a large number, even a majority of the 
people, are ready to vote for it. Opinions 
which a man maintains at the cost of another 
do not count largely in forming the general 
sentiment of the community, or in producing 
an effective public movement. They repre- 
sent selfishness rather than public spirit. The 
true public spirit is one which "will subordi- 
nate personal convenience to collective honor." 

We must agree with Mr. Hadley in his 
suggestion that there should be a more fully 
developed course of political education in our 
schools and colleges. Political education, as

he suggests, is not simply a study of facts about 
civil government, nor is it a training in those 
scientific principles which regulate the activity 
of governments. "It is not so much a devel- 
opment of certain kinds of knowledge as a 
development of certain essential qualities of 
character and habits of action." The charac- 
terization of subjects for such a course of study 
is one which we must unquestionably accept. 
It is subjects of an unprofessional character, 
things that are permanent and affairs that 
are large, which should serve as the basis of 
study, while a large part of the political edu- 
cation comes from the association of students. 

Mr. Hadley puts forward a strong word 
against that tendency in modern education 
which seeks to introduce specialism and pro- 
fessional studies at too early a date. He con- 
tends that higher education makes people bet- 
ter workers, better members of a body politic, 
and better men morally and spiritually ; and 
in his discussion of this subject he shows clearly 
the difference between college training and 
technical training. 

In conclusion, it may be said that a distinct 
service has been rendered general education by 
the publication of these papers, inasmuch as 
they represent a thoroughly sound educational 
point of view, at the same time a point of view 
from which, in many quarters, there has been 
great divergence in the last few years.

Studies of Roman Institutions.* 



The two books before us — " Roman Public 
Life " by Professor Greenidge of Oxford, and 
" Roman Political Institutions " by Professor 
Abbott of the University of Chicago — are 
alike in their limitation to public institutions, 
and in the chronological boundaries set by 
their respective authors, each beginning with 
the earliest period and extending to the age of 
Diocletian. In purpose and method of treat- 
ment there is considerable difference. Profes- 
sor Abbott's work is intended as an introduc- 
tory text-book, for pupils planning a more 
extended course in Roman Institutions ; the 
volume of Mr. Greenidge is one of Macmil- 
lan's well-known series of " Handbooks of

the University of Chicago. Boston : Ginn & Co. 



Archaeology and Antiquities," and thus under 
greater obligation to be complete. 

Professor Abbott makes a somewhat un- 
usual division of his work, treating each of the 
three periods, — monarchical, republican, and 
imperial, — first from the historical and then 
from the descriptive point of view. This di- 
vision is intentionally carried to such a point 
that the teacher may use either the historical 
or the descriptive sections separately if it be 
thought desirable. Of course it is impossible 
to make an absolutely exact division on such 
a basis, but the end in mind has been ade- 
quately secured. For the student who really 
wishes to go into the subject deeply. Professor 
Abbott has done an admirable service in his 
constant marginal references to sources, his 
select bibliographies for the various chapters, 
and at the close of many chapters his analyzed 
lists of passages in various ancient authors re- 
ferring to the subjects treated in these chap- 
ters. The selections from the sources to which 
reference is made for Chapter V., for instance, 
cover fifty-six different subjects, and embrace 
fifty passages in Livy, twenty-four in Poly bins, 
nine in Cicero, six in Eutropius, three each in 
Plutarch, Appian, and Gellius, one in Tacitus, 
one in Macrobius, and one inscription. Refer- 
ences to the best modern critics of the sources 
are also given in many cases. Of course all this 
is not much to the average student, but the 
growing tendency to keep in mind the best 
rather than the average, in such matters, can- 
not be too highly commended. 

Mr. Greenidge's book is not so well ar- 
ranged nor so clearly written as that of Pro- 
fessor Abbott. It of course gives information 
on many points not taken up at all by the other, 
as has already been indicated. It may be ques- 
tioned whether a " handbook " should concern 
itself so extensively as this does with what may, 
might, must, could, would, or should have been, 
or not have been. These doubtful forms of 
statement strike the eye so constantly that one 
feels for the moment almost like wondering 
whether anything at all really was, or was not, 
in the affairs of ancient Rome. Certainly one 
cannot lay the book down with the impression 
that the student of history as yet faces any 
great dearth of unsolved problems as subjects 
for theses and dissertations. These long- 
standing uncertainties, however, are not hope- 
less. Researches in the Greek papyri, for in- 
stance, have very recently thrown light upon 
points in Roman law which were heretofore in 
question.

The two writers are agreed in attributing the 
breakdown of the republican constitution to the 
weight of " empire." " The general machinery 
of government had broken down," says Profes- 
sor Abbott, " under the strain put upon it by 
the policy of imperialism." Mr. Greenidge, 
after calling attention to the inconsistent and 
unsystematic nature of the earlier constitution, 
adds : 

" But as the knots which the jurists could not untie 
were cut by the sword, and the constitution reverted to 
a type far simpler even than that of its origin, we must 
assume a weakness in the mixed system, which might 
not have rendered it inadequate as the government of 
a city state, or even of Italy, but certainly rendered it 
incapable of imperial rule. The test was a severe one, 
and the constitution which could not answer the strain 
need not be wholly condemned. For empire is a mere 
excrescence on the life of a state, a test neither of its 
goodness nor of its vitality." 

There are many other details of these books 

which might be noticed, but we shall close with 

a single one, and that is the imperfection of the 

indices, — not serious, perhaps, as indices go, 

but it is certainly time that indices should go 

a different gait. .^rr tt t

Side-IjIghts ox Art History.* 



Beginning with Vasari and Billi, who wrote the 
lives of their contemporaries and immediate pre- 
decessors, and coming down through the long list 
which includes Morelli, Kugler, Mrs. Jameson, 
Richter, Lubke, and many others, the history of 
Italian art would seem to have been written so 
many times and from so many points of view as to 
make farther words superfluous. But such a con- 
clusion leaves out of account several things avail- 
able to the modern writer, things which Vasari 
and even later authors knew not of. Vasari, indeed, 
had the enormous advantage of writing of the life 
that he himself lived, of the men that he knew, of 
the works that he had seen, and also of being in

position to see most of what was best in Italy. 
Moreover, as a practicing architect and a prolific 
painter he had the technical knowledge which en- 
abled him to judge of what he saw, and he knew 
how to write about it in prose so charming that — 
all possible deductions to his discredit being granted 
— Vasari's "Lives" will always rank among the 
classics of the art student. But it was his disad- 
vantage to have lived in an age which had little his- 
toric sense, and which also preceded the invention 
of the camera. In our time, history has developed 
into a science based on researches among archives, 
the evidence of documents, the sifting and com- 
paring of testimony, and on explorations of various 
kinds. It may take several generations still to ex- 
purgate Vasari's narratives of their contradictions, 
misapprehensions, and guess-work ; in the mean- 
time, photography comes to the aid of the pen to 
furnish accurate and delightful reproductions, in 
black-and-white, of the great masterpieces in color 
or form. Thus, with new materials coming to hand 
and fresh means of illustration, the history of Ital- 
ian art, though often told, may be regarded as still 
In the making, and there is justification for the 
many new books which seek to throw side-lights 
upon it, either as a whole or in parts. 

Of such books, one of the most interesting is Mr. 
Edward C Strutt's volume devoted to Fra Filippo 
Lippi, in which he attempts a refutal of the " legend- 
ary prejudices handed down to us by twelve gener- 
ations of superficial or biassed critics" — preju- 
dices voiced epigrammatically in Browning's 
dramatic monologue by the friar himself: 
" Zooks, sir, flesh and blood, 
That 's all I'm made of !" 

While admitting many of the Carmelite's frailties, 
Mr. Strutt finds them only superficial compared 
with the depth and tenacity of his artistic nature. 
He finds him more, infinitely more, than mere 
"flesh and blood," attaining at times a degree of 
perfection absolutely incompatible with his sup- 
posed baseness of soul, and to a grandeur of con- 
ception and a technical skill which reveal him as 
the connecting link between Masaccio and Raphael, 
and, indeed, the truest herald of the Renaissance. 

Both as man and artist, Fra Lippi gains much at 
the hands of his new biographer. It is shown that 
he was almost certainly a personal pupil of Masac- 
cio's, and not simply a student of his works in the 
Brancacci Chapel, as implied by Vasari ; that he 
never " threw off the clerical habit," but left the 
cloister of the Carmine with the prior's consent 
and permission, continuing to wear the habit of the 
order all his life, and remaining in cordial relations 
of friendship with his former brethren ; that his 
motives for leaving were not only the hopes of ac- 
quiring wealth and greatness by the practice of his 
art, but also to support his poverty-stricken rela- 
tives, who otherwise must have starved. 

Naturally, it was not long before the " glad 
monk " came under the spell of the great move- 
ment of his age — the Renaissance, — which was

in turn strongly influenced by him. The decisive 
turning-point in his life, however, was when he left 
Florence for Prato. Here for thirteen years he 
worked, completing that series of frescoes in the 
Dnomo which constitutes not only the greatest 
achievement of his own career, but the most re- 
markable artistic event since the completion of 
Masaccio's frescoes of the Brancacci Chapel in 
Florence. 

It must not be inferred that Mr. Strutt's biog- 
raphy is of the " whitewash " order now too prev- 
alent. He grants that there were germs of sensu- 
ality and human passion in the young monk's breast, 
which, in the corrupt atmosphere of the Medicean 
court, blossomed forth and flourished until the 
poisonous weed almost stifled the beautiful flower 
of his better nature. But throughout all he finds 
a gradual and uninterrupted evolution of the artist 
toward a perfection which made him a powerful and 
abiding influence in the art of the Quattrocento. 
The Prato frescoes furnished suggestions for Bot- 
ticelli's dancing nymphs and swaying angels ; the 
tondo Madonna, now in the Pitti Palace, intro- 
duced a new interpretation of the old theme, which 
later reached its highest manifestation in Raphael's 
Madonna of the Chair ; the background of the same 
picture was the direct precursor of figures in the 
historical paintings of Ghirlandajo and Raphael. 

Three highly interesting personalities — Rem- 
brandt, Mantegna, Giotto — form the subjects of 
the latest three volumes of the series of " Great 
Masters in Painting and Sculpture." Presenting 
respectively the greatest painter of the Dutch 
school, the chief of the Paduan, and the most epoch- 
making of the Florentine, they are an interesting 
group. 

The Rembrandt volume is a condensation by 
Mr. Malcolm Bell of his own earlier work ; and 
the task he has set himself is very like the one 
undertaken by Mr. Strutt for Lippi, — to give a 
truer and more kindly picture of one who has been 
misjudged sorely. But it is less entertaining as well 
as less convincing in style. The matter is divided 
into three parts — Rembrandt the Man, Rembrandt 
the Painter, and Rembrandt the Etcher. The 
illustrations are numerous, and the genealogical and 
chronological tables as complete as is possible with 
our uncertain knowledge. 

The biographer of Mantegna, Miss Maude Crutt- 
well, has few accepted notions to dislodge, and no 
follies and frailties to condone. Mantegna was 
one who took life seriously, ardently, with no 
doubts of its worth nor of the value of his own 
labors therein. Straining every nerve toward the 
new ideals of life and thought which were to bring 
a fresh youth back to the world, he was among 
those who give significance to Morelli's term for 
this period — " the epoch of character." Some 
interesting pages of the opening chapter are devoted 
to a description of the Paduan school founded by 
Squarcione — archaeological rather than artistic, as 



compared with the contemporary school at Florence. 

Very iconoclastic indeed is Mr. F. Mason Per- 
kins in his volume on Giotto. He places Giotto's 
birth some ten years earlier than Vasari's date, 
and makes him the son of a well-to-do landed pro- 
prietor instead of a poverty-stricken day-laborer ; 
ignores the story of Cimabue's accidental discovery 
of the lad ; sees evidence that so far as he may 
have had any real teaching beyond that of Nature 
herself, it came through the works of Giovanni 
Pisano ; maintains that we may to a certain extent 
trace for ourselves the stages of his extraordinary 
development as an artist through the frescoes and 
paintings still remaining to us, ruined and repainted 
as in the majority of cases they are. But even 
more revolutionary than the chapters relating to 
Giotto himself are the two introductory chapters 
dealing with his forerunners and the influences 
which prepared the way for him. We have been 
accustomed to hear the now famous pulpit of the 
Baptistery at Pisa — the earliest known work of 
Niccolo Pisano — cited almost invariably as the 
first important product of what has been termed 
the " Modern Age " of Italian art. Mr. Perkins 
regards Niccolo far more as one gifted with un- 
usual powers of appreciative selection than as a 
really extraordinary innovator. That mysterious 
personage, Cimabue, to whom the entire credit of 
the sudden revival of the pictorial arts in Tuscany 
has been long given, loses several of his laurels; 
in fact, he may be considered as a type represen- 
tative of that artistic progress and advance which 
we know to have taken place in Florentine art dur- 
ing the latter part of the thirteenth century, rather 
than as any strictly defined personality. 

As a whole, this twentieth volume of the " Great 
Masters " series is truly a model for a work of this 
class, — a combination of a biographical sketch and 
critical guide-book based on independent and schol- 
arly investigation. 

Of quite a different type from the foregoing 
books is the volume of " Stories of the Tuscan 
Artists," since it is not a critical work, and makes 
no pretension to original research. It is, however, 
a pleasant gathering together — chiefly for the sake 
of young people or of beginners in art-study — of 
tales relating either to the artists or to the subjects 
of their works. The illustrations (fifty-three in 
number), on which so much of the value of a work 
of this kind depends, are particularly well-chosen 
and admirably reproduced in photogravure and half- 
tone ; moreover, the writer has a vivid and pic- 
turesque style, which holds the attention and makes 
the volume extremely readable. But it is not pos- 
sible to rate highly a book so full of errors of the 
most patent and inexcusable nature. In art mat- 
ters these are legion, and may easily mislead the 
amateur ; but even a child in the infant class of a 
Sunday school will know better than to accept the 
statement on page 119, " Trajan, who was emperor 
of Rome at the time of the birth of Christ," etc.

These " Stories " begin with the sculptors of the 
school of Pisa and conclude with Botticelli as the 
most representative artist of the classical revival. 
Being so good for their purpose in naany ways, it is 
a pity that a little kindly oversight should not have 
made this book a great deal better. 

Closely connected with the art-life of Italy is the 
monastery of San Marco. Not only two great 
artists — Fra Angelico and Fra Bartolommeo — in 
succession dwelt within its cloisters, but nearly all 
of the Quattrocento artists fell more or less under 
the influence of its great preacher, Savonarola. 
Naturally, the larger part of Mr. G. S. Godkin's 
attractive book on " The Monastery of San Marco " 
is concerned with the brilliant but tragic story of 
Savonarola ; but the illustrations are half-tones 
from Fra Angelico's frescoes, and some of the most 
interesting pages are in the concluding chapter, 
^' After Savonarola." No traveller can be so 
phlegmatic as to stand within the walls of San 
Marco without a swelling heart ; it is alive with 
innumerable memories, its cloisters and cells and 
library are eloquent of its glorious past. The late 
repentant Florentines have built within its walls a 
tomb to the prophet whom their fathers stoned; 
and in the Piazza Signoria, where " the martyr's 
soul went out in fire," was uncovered in May last 
a large bronze disc with a medallion bust of the 
great Frate, and an inscription recording the man- 
ner of his death " by an iniquitous sentence." The 
whole story is so well told in this book, that it will 
serve as the next best thing to an actual visit to the 
spot whither the thoughtful tourist is almost certain 
to turn his first steps after arrival in Florence. 

Only one section of Professor James M. Hop- 
pin's book on " Great Epochs in Art History " is 
devoted to Italian art, but it is the first and much 
the longest one (a hundred and twenty-five pages), 
and is called " Italian Religious Painting." Start- 
ing at the very beginning of painting, as found in 
the sacred places and houses of the first Christians 
of ancient Rome, the essay gives principal place to 
Giotto, Signorelli, the Sienese school, Benozzo, 
Gozzoli, Perugino, and Raphael. The story ends 
where Michael Angelo's work begins, although his 
name is introduced as "the last and greatest," and 
his " Creation of Man " in the Sistine Chapel is 
called " a sublimer reach of the imagination than 
all that had gone before which was called art." 
"And yet," adds the author, "the older Italian 
artists of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, in 
their simple nature and childlike faith, dwelt nearer 
the springs of divine inspiration in religious paint- 
ing than Michael Angelo, and better exemplified 
the profound words of Protagoras, ' The true test 
of Art is its seeming absence.' " An interesting 
feature of this little sketch is the place given to the 
small towns as art-centres. Assisi, Orvieto, San 
Gemignano, Prato, Pistoja, and Arezzo are shown to 
have had quite as much as Florence to do with the 
development of Tuscan art ; the evolution pro- 
ceeded from mind to mind in unseen coils resem- 



bling the development of new forms in nature, but 
the centres of art were changing continually. In 
general, this essay will be found a safe guide ; but 
it was not the " Divided Annunciation " that in- 
spired Browning's poem of " Fra Lippo Lippi " (as 
stated on page 67), but " The Coronation of the 
Virgin." Moreover, to call this volume " Some 
Great Epochs in Art History " would be surely a 
more appropriate title than its present one. The 
reader's sense of order is offended to find this first 
essay followed by one on Scopas, who lived four 
hundred years before Christ ; and close upon its 
heels come " French Gothic Architecture " and 
"English Pre-Raphaelites." Excellent as each of 
these is in itself, they are too unrelated in time and 
character to admit a grouping under a title which 
implies some continuity, or at least some trans- 
cendent importance such as they hardly possess in 
art-history. 

Inseparably connected with the study and enjoy- 
ment of art is a knowledge of symbolism. To trace 
the original significance of the symbols now inter- 
woven with each Saint represented in art, to go 
back to the primal cause of the choice of some spe- 
cial patron by this or that section of the community, 
is to gain fresh light both on the meaning of any 
artist's work and also on the equally interesting evo- 
lution of popular belief. Good work has already 
been done by such students as Helmsdoerfer, Von 
Radowitz, Parker, and Mrs. Jameson ; but in the 
field of symbolism, as elsewhere, there has been 
need for the modern process of scientific sifting. 
This has now been done most engagingly by Mrs. 
Arthur Bell, in her book of " Lives and Legends of 
the Evangelists, Apostles, and Other Early Saints." 
Here we have embodied recent discoveries, new 
facts of undoubted authenticity in the received 
biographies of many Saints ; and even the compara- 
tively uncertain field of legend is not without some 
illumination on several persistent yet hitherto inex- 
plicable traditions. Both the text and the illustra- 
tions serve to mark the different stages of art de- 
velopment, the religious life of the various periods 
at which they were produced. Consequently, typi- 
cal works are presented from masters as diverse as 
Fra Angelico, Luini, Sodoma, Memlinc, Madox 
Brown, and Holman Hunt. 

Without disparagement to the foregoing books, 
it may still be said that the most important of all 
on our list is the last. New histories of art are less 
needed than books to tell us the reasons why we 
enjoy, or should enjoy, works of art when we see 
them. This is what Professor L. J. Freeman's 
work on " Italian Sculpture of the Renaissance " 
undertakes to do. Although the subject is treated 
chronologically, beginning with the Pisani and end- 
ing with Michael Angelo, it is addressed chiefly to 
the aesthetic sense. The author acknowledges that 
the scientist may classify Greek marbles as dispas- 
sionately as he would beetles, and gain in both in- 
stances the same intellectual pleasure. But this is 
the secondary value of art, the primary value being 



280

to use the data of observation imaginatively, to find 
in it the same suggestions for fancy that one finds 
in music, in natural objects, in the spoken word. 

These primary values vary in type continually, 
from the symbols of the mediaeval carvers to the 
highly expressive sculpture of the sixteenth century. 
But the author's fullest strength is shown in his 
most difficult task — the analysis of reasons for 
our satisfaction or dissatisfaction in the works of 
Michael Angelo. Speaking of that great but early 
work, the " David," he says : 

"The real reason, I think, for the lapses of enjoyment 
■which are sure to occur during one's contemplation of the 
David is found in the fact that the young sculptor has chosen, 
as an older sculptor would not have chosen, to represent the 
most awkward state in the development of the human body, 
and every defect of development is emphasized by colossal 
size. So that, although the thing is so well done that it com- 
municates the sensations of physical energy directly and with 
a rush, it is not, after all, a form that can steadily invigorate, 
for it is the arrest in stone of a transition in growth," 

Between the completion of the " David " and the 
beginning of the plans for the tombs of the Medici 
in San Lorenzo, which are the exponents of Michael 
Angelo's second manner in sculpture, sixteen years 
had elapsed, — years of disappointment, disillusion, 
and, most insupportable of all, diversion of artistic 
energy into expression by means of painting. The 
kind of enjoyment gained from the artist in the 
work of these later years is not the kind given by 
sculpture ordinarily ; and the observer who stands 
before the nudes of Michael Angelo neither as an 
artist nor as an anatomist is in a position analogous 
to one who listens to a play in a foreign language. 
The author's psychological explanation of the state 
of mind they induce is interesting, but we have 
space for only a brief quotation. 

" The temperament feels what it brings the power to feel. 
Whatever the environment has been, if one is akin to Michael 
Angelo in temperament, he will feel before these figures the 
exaltation and incorporation of forces whose workings he has 
felt or is destined to feel, and he therefore obtains a great 
aesthetic pleasure. As it happens, the generations since 
Michael Angelo have shared in that temperament so gener- 
ally that he has expressed them to themselves, and in so doing 
afforded to the modern consciousness the relief of defining 
itself in art. 

" Yet as any mode of artistic expression, however deep and 
wide it be, will always be inadequate to human experience, 
there will always be a minority who feel its scope, but whom 
it does not express. Therefore there are temperaments who 
feel Michael Angelo's powerful communication of vitality, 
but cannot so enjoyably translate it into intimate emotion." 

A work so individual and important as this can- 
not be represented justly by quotations ; but after 
reading it one feels that the following words of the 
Introduction are hardly extravagant : 

"Unless the architect who studies Brunelleschi's dome 
feels the unique beauty of its wonderful curve, unless the 
archaeologist who dates a Greek vase is in some degree 
teased out of thought by its loveliness of form, unless the 
poet, to whom Botticelli's Spring is a Lucretian allegory of 
the seasons, sees and feels the pattern of line intertwining 
with line, he is as blind to primary values as were the Roman 
peasants who made a quarry of the Forum, and burned an- 
tique marbles to procure the lime for their wretched huts."

An amusing " ^^ Introduction to English Liter- 

text-bookon ature," by Mr. Maurice Francis 

Engiuh literature, ggan, is published by Messrs. Mar- 
lier & Co., evidently for the use of parochial schools. 
It is curious that a man of the author's parts should 
have been willing to present so distorted a view of 
the history of our literature, or to have made his 
theological bias so very evident. His idea seems 
to have been that every Catholic writer, no matter 
how insignificant, must be exalted. This leads to 
such results as four pages about Southwell in a 
chapter which can spare but a single page for Mar- 
lowe, to a whole chapter of twenty pages devoted 
to Pope, while Milton has to be contented with five,, 
to the setting of Moore " in the first rank of lyrical 
poets," and to other like vagaries. But the real 
quality of this astonishing manual must be set forth 
by actual quotations. It is a little startling to be 
told that Milton " advocated polygamy," and that 
" Keats does not inspire or ennoble." When we 
read that " Shelley is enthusiastically admired by 
all who love poetry for the qualities that make it 
80 entirely different from prose," we are much im- 
pressed by the profundity of the thought. It is 
also interesting to learn of Shelley that he " was 
born a poet of a very high order ; he made himself 
a bad man." There is a finality about this pro- 
nouncement that leaves nothing further to be said. 
The late Aubrey de Vere, we are told, wrote " the 
most mighty drama since Shakespeare or Dryden."^ 
We have the greatest respect for Mr. De Vere's 
memory, as we trust our readers have also, but it 
may be well to jog the memory by saying that 
" Alexander the Great " is the name of this " mighty 
drama." Of Mr. Swinburne we read that " one of 
the saddest things in modern literature is the sight 
of this poet with a divine gift dissolving his pearls 
in acid for swine to drink." One inimitable para:- 
graph must be quoted in full. 

"Matthew Arnold's poems have great merit, but he was 
first of all a prose writer. His ' Thyrsis ' has been much 
praised. He lacked Faith, and consequently Hope. The 
same may be said of Arthur Hugh Clough. Clough, knowing 
no Christ, is painfully gloomy. His 'Long Vacation Exer- 
cise ' is an interesting exercise in hexameters ; he had great 
talent." 

We can recommend this book for amusement, if 
not exactly for instruction.

notable, however, — like some others in the series, 
— as being the work not of a contemporary nor of 
a too ardent worshipper, but of a critic who could 
handle his subject quite objectively. His aim has 
been to present the main facts of Longfellow's life

""with snch comments as are now appropriate — the com- 
ments natural to men who have heen born since Longfellow's 
best work was done, and who, though they honour him not 
less than did his contemporaries, must of necessity judge 
him, and the little world in which he moved, from a different 
point of ■view." 

The picture of the poet's life in Brunswick and 
Cambridge, though necessarily but an outline, is 
sympathetic and, we believe, true. In his criticism 
of Longfellow's writings Professor Carpenter agrees 
in the main with his leading predecessors. He points 
out that we have outgrown the didacticism which 
the readers of sixty years ago found so inspiring; 
but dwells on the high distinction achieved by Long- 
fellow in securing a permanent hold upon "the 
heart and intelligence of the people at large, of 
nineteen-twentieths of the race." He pays some at- 
tention to the foreign sources from which the poet 
drew his models and sometimes his ways of think- 
ing — a subject which has never yet received ade- 
<iuate treatment. Altogether the author has suc- 
ceeded remarkably well in preserving a good pro- 
portion and in producing an interesting narrative. 
For the frontispiece a reproduction of Samuel Law- 
rence's crayon portrait of 1854 has been wisely 
chosen : the one which best, to quote Mr. Winter, 
" l)reserve8 that alert, inspired expression which 
came into his face when he was affected by any 
strong emotion." It is significant that this portrait 
was made in the year in which Longfellow freed 
himself from the drudgery of college teaching and 
began to realize his dream of a life devoted wholly 
to letters. . 

It is with something of surprise that 
1SS4. th« reader learns the contents of 

Mr. Arthur Hassall's volume on 
" The French People," in the series of " Great 
Peoples " issued by Messrs. Appleton & Co. The 
book is really not a history of the French people as 
such, but a history of France as viewed through its 
political events, and of the leadership of rulers and 
statesmen who have too often been inclined to fol- 
low their own will without consulting that of the 
people. Therefore, the one who seeks information 
as to how the nation lived through adversities and 
bore itself in peace and struggle, its resources, its 
prosperity, and its economic misery, seeks here in 
vain. Only occasionally is there a hint about what 
the people really thought and felt. A history of 
the French people which should picture it to us as 
the English people has been pictured, is something 
for which we may wait long. Meanwhile we are 
to be content with this really attractive volume, 
which, although repeating what has already been 
told so often, does it with a certain terseness of 
style and poignancy of phrase that make the old 
theme sound somewhat new. Mr. Hassall has 
usually the knack of making the subject he treats 
yield fresh interest and instruction. In this case 
some of the freshness of interest is due to the 
writer's very English attitude in judging French 
political life of the past and present. The book 



seems to have been written with the main idea of 
demonstrating that France has never known how 
to inaugurate local or parliamentary government or 
foster popular freedom, but has been rescued from 
recurring anarchy only by a strong and generally 
arbitrary government. " The temper of the French 
people as seen in its government" might well have 
been the title of the book. And Mr. Hassall must 
be said to have been right in his estimate. But 
with all her fondness for a strong, even a military, 
government, France has nevertheless, even in her 
periods of absolute rule, given suggestions of 
freedom of a far subtler kind : the freedom of 
literary discussion, of artistic perfection, of philo- 
sophic inquiry, of amiable intercourse and good 
manners, — freedom depending upon maturity of 
mind and vivacity of temperament, such as Europe 
nowhere else evolved in so typical a fashion. The 
author has given some instances of this, but by no 
means enough of them. It is not quite fair to 
make political forms alone the basis from which to 
judge a nation's strength or influence. We think, 
however, that with the scope of inquiry which the 
author has set himself, the book will be found well 
worth reading, and may easily replace others on 
our shelves in which the same things are said less 
aptly. 



So much controversy followed the 
o^nsZf^"''' purchase of Florida and its occupa- 
tion by the United States, largely 
because of discussion of General Jackson's bold 
actions, that when some questioned the worth 
of the acquisition, stating that it was a land of 
swamps and forests, others replied, in facetious 
strain, that it was certainly productive — of docu- 
ments. The latest contest with Spain in the same 
part of the world seems to be followed by similar 
evidence of productiveness ; and, because of the 
bitter discussions and dissensions in army and navy 
circles, it may be a long time before anyone can 
tell in impartial and unprejudiced language the 
true story of the Spanish- American War. Certainly 
Secretary Alger could not be expected to do this, 
and his book at once takes its place in the list of 
controversial writings. It is not really an attempt 
to give the history of an international contest, as 
its title, " The Spanish-American War " (Harper), 
would indicate ; but the purpose behind it was " to 
place on record some of the prominent facts con- 
nected with the organization, equipment, and move- 
ments of the army, together with the administra- 
tion of the War Department, with the hope that such 
statement will serve a useful purpose as an example, 
should another crisis of the same kind occur." 
The war itself was marked by many surprises, 
where good fortune seemed to follow American 
movements at every turn. The resources of the 
country were scarcely touched before the fighting 
was over ; and so the strain of the conflict being 
speedily ended, there was abundant opportunity for 
discussion and fault-finding. There was no prepar-

ation for war, and that the results were so gener- 
ally favorable was no more surprising than was the 
comparatively quick organization and equipment of 
an army of a quarter of a million men, when there 
was in the country not a bit of khaki cloth for 
uniforms nor manufactory familiar with its produc- 
tion, and not duck cloth enough to make tents for 
the men. The chapters in Secretary Alger's book 
which tell of campaigns in which he did not par- 
ticipate will not be regarded of so much importance 
as those which tell of the campaigns in the Quar- 
termaster's department in which he was vitally 
interested. And in all likelihood the judgment of 
the future historian will be that difficulties were 
met about as well as could have been expected 
considering the generation of peace after the Civil 

War. 

Without attempting to discuss " the 
quiddity of ens," Dr. Norman Bridge 
attacks, with acumen and good sense, 
some more or less abstruse questions in his little 
book, "The Rewards of Taste" (Stone), which 
also treats of " Some Tangents of the Ego," " The 
Mind for a Remedy," " The Etiology of Lying," 
*' Man as an Air-Eating Animal," " The Psychol- 
ogy of the Corset," " The Physical Basis of Ex- 
pertness," and " The Discordant Children." The 
essay chosen for the title-rdle is not the best of the 
series ; it fails to strike the keynote of the volume. 
The writer has the experienced physician's obser- 
vant eye, and he knows how to present his observa- 
tions in an attractive form. Indeed, he betrays 
something of that genius which consists in impart- 
ing fresh interest and wonder to the commonplace. 
His discussion of abnormalities of temperament, 
and their proper treatment, is especially good. 
Among "tangents of the ego," self-conceit, in its 
varied forms, claims a foremost place. " Who ever 
knew a conceited man to be conscious of his con- 
ceit ! " exclaims the author, almost in despair of a 
cure ; and he elsewhere cites the bishop who pro- 
tested that he was not conceited, but simply con- 
scious of his own superiority. Truly, the reader 
will say to himself, he who reduces all his egoistic 
tangents to the normal curve is better than he that 
taketh a city. To Dr. Bridge the mental state of 
a patient is vastly more significant than the physical. 
In his chapter on "The Mind for a Remedy," he 
takes an attitude toward the pseudo-scientific modes 
of healing that is surprisingly tolerant in a doctor 
of " the old school." He admits the efficacy, in 
certain cases, of "some novelty or humbug, or a 
belief in the power of something beyond himself on 
which the patient leans or believes he leans." " The 
Etiology of Lying " attracts by its very title. But 
it makes perfect truthfulness appear so hopelessly 
unattainable as almost to constitute a defense of 
falsehood, despite the wise closing words of the 
essay. " Man as an Air-Eating Animal " arouses 
curiosity — and satisfies it. In short, there is 
hardly a chapter that will not engage the interest 
of even the most languid reader. 



In a substantial volume of four hun-

chapters are devoted to particular plays, — " Mac- 
beth," "Merchant of Venice," "Julius Caesar," 
"Twelfth Night," "Othello." The story of each 
play is given at length in a running interpretation 
with comment on the technique of the plot. On 
the whole, Mr. Fleming has done a work well worth 
doing, and has done it well ; but he starts out with 
a false assumption rather mechanically conceived. 
It does not follow that because " the curve is the 
line of beauty," " a drama is written, not in the 
form of a triangle, but in that of an arch." A 
graphic representation of any drama, showing the 
rise and fall, as in the semicircle he employs, would 
deviate so much from the curve as to destroy wholly 
any feeling of conformity to the "line of beauty." 
By the very nature of the effect it is to produce, 
a drama must not be a series of gradual changes^ 
passing imperceptibly from one into the other. 
Mr. Fleming's style is simple to baldness, and far 
too often admits such sentences as, " Still another 
function which Viola fulfils is, she is Shakespeare's 
Type of the Normal." The analyses of the plots 
might very profitably have been brought within 
narrower limits, and the diff useness of treatment is 
made the more obvious and irritating by such ex- 
pressions as, " a technique that is simply perfect," 
" as fine work as Shakespeare ever did," employed 
without any attempt to indicate what makes the 
technique perfect or the work fine. The exclama- 
tory method of imparting literary information is 
certainly no longer in vogue, and it never was es- 
pecially illuminating. It is but fair to add that the 
volume contains a great deal of genuinely useful 
matter. It is the product of much careful, pains- 
taking work, and it is presented clearly and directly, 
if not attractively. The reader can hardly fail to 
get from it a better notion of the organic unity of 
a great drama, a surer insight into the literary 
architectonics of the world's greatest artist. 



Lamarek and 
the Lamarckian 
Revival. 



The rise in this country and in 
France of a Neo-Lamarckian school 
of organic evolutionists has awak- 
ened interest in the life and work of its founder. 
A man of genius who lived in advance of his age, 
unappreciated, neglected, and forgotten, comes to 
his own after the lapse of a century. His views on 
evolution have now taken rank as recognized rivals 
of the natural selection theory of Darwin, and not 
only win much support in some quarters but stir 
up opposition in others. Professor Alpheus S. 
Packard, in his volume on " Lamarck, his Life 
and Work" (Longmans, Green, & Co.), has ren- 
dered material aid to this discussion by his sympa- 
thetic treatment of the life of this naturalist, the 
able presentation of his scientific achievements, and 
the detailed rendition of his views on questions

which have risen to prominence in the literature of 
recent years. The hook is the outcome of a personal 
investigation of Lamarck's surroundings, his family 
history, his life at Paris, and his connection with 
the reorganization of the Jardin des Plantes and 
the establishment of the great Paris Museum of 
Natural History after the French Revolution. 
Lamarck was eminent not only as a botanist but 
preeminently as a zoologist. He did some credit- 
able work in geology, meteorology, and physical 
science, and became the father of invertebrate 
paleontology. Professor Packard has traced in 
his writings the steps in the growth of the theory 
which took final form in his Philosophic Zoolo- 
gique. He also summarizes his views on the evolu- 
tion of man, on morals, and on the relation of 
science and religion. The distinctions between 
Darwinism and Lamarckism, and the relations of 
the former to the modern school which claims kin- 
ship, are clearly stated. A full bibliography of 
Lamarck's writings is appended. 

Two text-book* The teacher of literature in our 
of American schools has uo longer cause to com- 

lUerature. pj^jn q£ ^jjg jg-ck of good text-books. 

Ten years ago, that lack constituted a real griev- 
ance, but so many excellent manuals have appeared 
during the past decade that the difficulty is now 
simply one of selection. Mr. A. G. Newcomer's 
" American Literature " (Scott, Foresman & Co.) 
is a recent addition to the list, and seems to us quite 
as good as any of its competitors. It remains a 
readable book, without sacrificing to diffuseness and 
the essay style the essential qualities of concise and 
accurate statement that must characterize a good 
working text. Its judgments are sober and well- 
considered, not diverging very far from what the 
writer calls " current estimates." The appendix of 
bibliographical notes and chronological tables is 
very useful, as is also the section of " Suggestions 
for Reading and Study." In the matter of illus- 
trative extracts the author, while not eschewing 
them altogether, is economical of his space, and 
finds room only for what is peculiarly typical or 
suggestive. — Miss H. L. Mason's " American Lit- 
erature : A Laboratory Method " (Philadelphia : 
The Author) is a text of wholly different type. It 
is not a book to be read at all, but rather a set of 
syllabi and exercises, based upon a working list of 
reference books. There are about twenty of these 
syllabi, each having a definite subject (such as 
" Criticism of Society," " Nature Studies," " The 
International Novel," and the like). Each syllabus 
outlines a course of reading, and tests the thorough- 
ness with which it has been pursued by an ingenious 
series of suggestive and rather searching questions. 
There is no doubt of the value of this method of 
study, although we believe it should always be 
coupled with the use of a consecutive historical 
text. When suitable library facilities are to be 
had, we can commend the present volume as an 
important adjunct in the work of teaching. 



"The Mind of the Child" (Long- 
RambUng chapter* ^j^^s) is the title of a volume by 

about ehxldren. ^ .-i-,.! •• ,.,. / 

Mr. iiinnis Richmond which in real- 
ity contains a rambling discourse, with a strong 
moralizing flavor, about the very many things one 
is likely to say concerning children, if one sets out 
to talk rather aimlessly yet coherently of these 
interesting bits of humanity. There is naturally 
much to be said concerning the relation of parents 
to children, and the responsibility of modern edu- 
cational systems for children's failings. There is 
the usual note of warning that in our zeal for 
child-study we may omit the best part of childhood. 
But all this has been said before, to the weariness 
of listeners at educational meetings ; and there is 
no need of reducing to cold, enduring print what 
may have properly served for the passing interest 
of an active discussion. No amount of such writ- 
ing will have the slightest influence upon matters 
pertaining to the study of children. The most praise- 
worthy fact about the book is that the author does 
not tell us that it was printed at the urgent solici- 
tation of friends ; for in most books of this type 
that ominous sentence meets the eye on the first 
page. 

BRIEFER MENTION. 



A charming little book, just published by Messrs. 
A. C. McClurg & Co. and printed at the Merrymount 
Press, is called " Right Reading," and is further de- 
scribed as containing " words of good counsel on the 
choice and use of books selected from the writings of 
ten famous authors." The counsellors in the case are 
Helps, Carlyle, Disraeli, Emerson, Schopenhauer, Rus- 
kin, J. C. Hare, Mr. John Morley, Lowell, and Mr. Fred- 
eric Harrison. Some of these chapters are familiar 
enough, but others are not known half as generally 
as they should be. We are particularly glad to find 
the pungent passage from Schopenhauer's " Parerga 
and Paralipomena," as translated by Mr. T. Bailey 
Saunders. 

Several excellent text-books for the study of civil 
government in the United States have been produced 
of late years, but all of them — with the exception of 
Professor Hinsdale's " The American Government " — 
have been unsatisfactory for the simple reason that 
they did not contain enough matter for the needs of the 
student. This complaint cannot be made of *' The 
Federal State" (Macmillan), by Mr. Roscoe Lewis 
Ashley, which is a volume of six hundred pages, discuss- 
ing every aspect of the subject that a teacher could 
wish, and is both attractive in presentation and logical 
in arrangement. Every educator knows the superior 
value of a book in which the student may delve, over a 
book which he is expected to learn outright, and Mr. 
Ashley's manual has this good quality, besides illus- 
trating all the other good qualities of its competitors. 
It seems to us to be exactly the book that has long 
been needed, and we strongly recommend it for use in 
the higher grades of secondary school work. 

A memorial volume containing many tributes to the 
late Lewis G. Janes is published by the James H. 
West Co. Books of this sort are apt to be somewhat 
perfunctory, but it is impossible to read the present

volume without beiug impressed by the heartfelt sin- 
cerity of what is said, and by the almost complete 
absence of the perfunctory element. The tributes 
are from many hands and hearts, from the associates 
of Dr. Janes in the work of the Brooklyn Ethical 
Society, the Greenacre Summer School, the Anti- 
Imperialist League, and the other good causes which 
he did so much to further. His friends will prize the 
volume, and to those who did not know him it will be 
interesting in its revelation of the intellectual effort, 
noble character, and simple goodness of its subject. 

Volume IV. of the " Publications of the Mississippi 
Historical Society," edited by Secretary Franklin L. 
Riley, comes to us from Oxford, Miss. It is a stout 
volume of five hundred pages, including much valuable 
matter. The Rev. Edward Everett Hale's documentary 
contribution on " The Real Philip Nolan " is the 
feature of greatest general interest; but the student of 
history will find his account in many other of the 
papers offered, for example, in Mr. J. W. Garner's 
study of " The First Struggle over Secession," or Mr. 
A. H. Stone's examination of the state Constitution 
and Statutes in their relation to the freedmen. The 
volume has its literary interest, too, in the form of Prof. 
Dabney Lipscomb's study of the writings of T. A. S. 
Adams. 

An interesting book has been made out of the 
" Saturday Review " of the New York " Times " by 
collecting the series of personal sketches of recent 
American writers that have been prepared for that 
paper by various hands. Mr. Francis Whiting Halsey 
has edited the volume, which is called "Authors of 
Our Day in their Homes." The number of authors 
included is twenty-two, and the illustrations are either 
portraits or photographs of library interiors. This work 
is published by Messrs. James Pott & Co. Mr. Halsey 
has also made a volume, this time of his own writings 
contributed to various periodicals, which he calls " Our 
Literary Deluge and Some of Its Deeper Waters," and 
which is published by Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. 

That veteran Grecian, Professor Alexander Kerr, of 
the University of Wisconsin, has just published, through 
Messrs. Ginn & Co., an edition of the " Bacehse " of 
Euripides, text and translation. The Greek and the 
English face each other upon the pages, and the latter 
is given us in stately and harmonious verse that it is a 
distinct pleasure to read. Professor Kerr is also en- 
gaged upon a translation of Plato's " Republic," in 
pamphlet parts, containing one book each. The notes 
are few but well selected, and take their place at the 
foot of the page. Two parts have thus far been issued 
by the publishers, Messrs. Charles H. Kerr & Co. It is 
a real boon to students to have the " Republic " made 
accessible in English in this inexpensive form. 

"Behind the Grill," by Mr. Duncan Francis Young, 
is a little book published by the Abbey Press. It tells 
in the form of brief chapters, many of which are single 
anecdotes, of the tribulations of the cashier of a small 
country bank. Written without any pretensions to lit- 
erary style, these reminiscences are pointed and inter- 
esting, revealing as they do so much of the petty mean- 
ness in human nature, and recounting so many of the 
devices by which careless or dishonest persons contrive 
to make life a burden for the bank cashier. Readers 
who do not know very much of the business of banking 
will find this an instructive little book, as well as an 
amusing one. 



Notes. 



" Westminster," by Mr. Reginald Airy, is a new vol- 
ume in the series of "Handbooks to the Great Public 
Schools," published by the Macmillan Co. 

" lolaus," an anthology of friendship compiled by 
Mr. Edward Carpenter, is announced for publication 
this month by Mr. Charles E. Goodspeed of Boston. 

"The Story of Pemaquid," by Mr. James Otis, is 
the second volume in the series of interesting little 
books called " Pioneer Towns of America," published 
by Messrs Thomas Y. Crowell & Co. 

The Bibliographical Society of Chicago will shortly 
issue a reprint, limited to three hundred copies, of the 
celebrated paper by Augustus de Morgan " On the Dif- 
ficulty of Correct Description of Books." 

Mr. Bliss Perry's series of " Little Masterpieces " 
by Bacon, Swift, Milton, Goldsmith, Johnson, and 
Emerson, form a set of six inviting and companion- 
able little books published in uniform dress by Messrs. 
Doubleday, Page & Co. 

Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. have just published a 
thin volume of " Four-Place Logarithmic Tables," pre- 
pared for use in the Yale entrance examinations. Mr. 
Percy F. Smith, of the Sheffield Scientific School, is 
the compiler of this work. 

"Roget's Thesaurus " is just fifty years old, but still 
proves useful. It is now sent us by Messrs. Thomas Y. 
Crowell & Co., in an edition which is a new impression of 
the revised form given it in 1879 by Mr. John Lewis 
Roget, the son of the compiler. 

In the latest volume of the dainty " Vest Pocket 
Series," published by Mr. Thomas B. Mosher, are 
brought together three of Robert Louis Stevenson's 
best-known essays, — " Ms Triplex," " Ordered South," 
and " Walking Tours." 

A "play-goer's edition" of "Soldiers of Fortune," 
by Mr. Richard Harding Davis, is published by Messrs. 
CharleS Scribner's Sons. Photographs of characters 
and scenes in the dramatic presentation of the novel 
constitute the distinctive feature of this edition. 

Mr. J. Walker McSpadden has prepared for the 
Messrs. Crowell a small volume of "Shaksperian Syn- 
opses," — the plays being outlined act by act, — which 
we should fancy might be found quite useful, both as 
a help for students and as a manual for hasty reference. 

The American Book Co. send us the " Outlines of 
Botany," by Mr. Robert Greenleaf Leavitt. This work, 
which is based upon Gray's " Lessons," is a laboratory 
and classroom manual, prepared for high school use at 
the request of the Botanical Department of Harvard 
University. 

" Helpful Thoughts from the Meditations of Marcus 
Aurelius Antoninus," selected by Mr. Walter Lee 
Brown, is a pretty pocket volume just published by 
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. " Thoughts which have 
helped me," is the motto of the compiler and the basis 
upon which his selection has been made. 

We note with pleasure that works of recent litera- 
ture are being selected with increasing frequency for 
publication as annotated modern language texts. " Der 
Talisman," by Herr Ludwig Fulda, has attracted the 
pedagogical eye of Dr. C. W. Prettyman, and, in a 
school edition published by Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co., 
is made accessible to many readers who would not be 
likely otherwise to get possession of it. Another modern

text, sent us by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co., is a thin 
volume of Herr Gottfried Keller's " Legenden," edited 
by Miss Margarete Miiller and Miss Carla Wenckebach. 

" Hasty Pudding Poems," compiled and edited by 
Mr. Rodney Blake, is published by the New Amsterdam 
Book Co. It is a collection of " impulsive and im- 
promptu verses," containing such things as poems on 
panes, rhyming wills, old tavern signs, advertisements 
in rhyme, death-bed verses, and other curious and in- 
genious matters. 

" A History of Ancient Greek Literature," by Dr. 
Harold N. Fowler, is one of the " Twentieth Century 
Text-Books " of the Messrs. Appleton. Primarily a 
college manual of the subject, the work is yet one that 
may be read with interest, and contains, as the author 
observes, " little or nothing which should not be familar 
to every educated man and woman." 

" Eadie's Biblical Cyclopaedia " (Lippincott) is an 
old stand-by in the orthodox household, and its con- 
tinued popularity is attested by the new edition now 
published. A number of good scholars have taken 
part in the revision, although the treatment of many 
subjects is still far from modern and scientific. There 
are nearly seven hundred pages, with many illustrations. 

" The Life of John Ruskin," by Mr. W. G. Colling- 
wood, as now published by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin 
& Co., is primarily a condensation of the more extended 
biography of 1893. But much of the text has been 
rewritten, and many new details added, while the nar- 
rative is now brought down to the end of Ruskin's life. 
There are even a number of letters now printed for the 
first time. 

" The Umbrian Towns," published by the A. Wessels 
Co., is a volume in the series of historical guide-books, 
projected, and partly carried out, by the late Grant 
Allen. The work is prepared by Messrs. J. W. and 
A. M. Cruickshank, who have been faithful to Allen's 
general plan, ignoring petty information, and placing 
the emphasis upon matters of real historical and artistic 
significance. These books supplement the orthodox 
guides, but by no means take their place. 

The second and concluding part of the New Vel- 
azquez Spanish-English Dictionary, as revised and 
enlarged by Messrs. Edward Gray and Juan L. Iribas, 
will be published at an early date by Messrs D. Apple- 
ton & Co. The revision has been done with unusual 
thoroughness, the entire text being recast, modified, 
and modernized. Nearly eight thousand new titles and 
several hundred new idioms are contained in the first 
part alone. The "New VeUzquez " must undoubt- 
edly take its place as the standard Spanish-English 
dictionary. 

A volume of " Notes on Child Study," by Dr. Ed- 
ward Lee Thorndike, is published by Columbia Uni- 
versity as a double number in its philosophical series. 
The book is exactly what it pretends to be, a volume of 
lecture-notes for use in pedagogical teaching, and it is 
now printed that students in pedagogical courses may 
use it as a sort of syllabus in their work. The volume 
offers suggestions for practical exercises of many kinds, 
and, in the hands of a teacher who knows how to use 
such material, ought to prove an exceedingly useful 
adjunct to his instruction. 

Dr. Thomas Dunn English, who died on the first of 
the month, had nearly completed his eighty-third year, 
having been born in 1819. Although a fairly prolific 
literary worker, his fame may be said to have suffered 



rather than benefitted by the wide popularity of a single 
song. He was so generally known as the author of 
" Ben Bolt " that in the public mind his name came to 
be associated with that song alone, just as the name 
of John Howard Payne is associated with " Home, 
Sweet Home," regardless of " Brutus " and all the 
other " works." Among the books of Dr. English, the 
following list is fairly representative, although far 
from complete. It comprises " American Ballads," the 
"Boy's Book of Battle Lyrics," "Select Poems," 
" Fairy Stories and Wonder Tales," " Jacob Schuyler's 
Millions," and " Ambrose Fecit." There are also sev- 
eral plays to the credit of this writer. Most of the 
work here mentioned dates from his later years, but we 
get some idea of his relations with an earlier period 
when we remember that " Ben Bolt " was written in 
1842, and that Poe, in " The Literati," paid him his 
compliments. Dr. English's son-in-law, the Rev. Arthur 
Howard Noll, will probably collect the literary remains 
of this worthy man of letters.

A Summer Trip not 
Surpassed on the Continent. 

The trip to Salt Lake City, or to the Pacific coast 
via that point over the Denver & Rio Grande and 
the Rio Grande Western is the most beautiful in 
America. No European trip of equal length can 
compare with it in grandeur of scenery or wealth 
of novel interest. Then Salt Lake City itself is 
a most quaint and picturesque place and well 
worth the journey. Its Mormon temple, taber- 
nacle, tithing office and church institutions; its 
hot sulphur springs within the city limits; its 
delightful temperature, sunny climate and its 
Great Salt Lake — deader and denser than the 
Dead Sea in Palestine — are but a few features 
of Salt Lake City's countless attractions. There 
are parks, drives, canons and beautiful outlying 
mountain and lake resorts. Imagine, if you can, 
a bath in salt water a mile above sea level and 
in water in which the human body cannot sink. 
Inquire of your nearest ticket agent for low 
tourist rates to Salt Lake City, or write for 
information and copy of " Salt Lake City, the 
City of the Saints," to S. K. Hooper, general

Text-Books of Real Importance 



The History of English Literature 

By William Vaughn Moody and Robert Morss Lovett of the University of Chicago. 

12mo; about 450 pages. (Ready April 22.) 

An account of English letters covering especially the period from which requirements are taken for col- 
lege entrance examinations. Besides giving secondary school students a correct understanding of the origin 
and meaning of English literature, the book is designed particularly to place before them in perspective the 
greater personalities and their significance. There are admirable discussions of Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton, 
Dryden, Pope, Wordsworth, and the Georgian and Victorian poets and novelists, with full commentaries and 
reviews of their more important work. The bibliography is more comprehensive, complete, and practical 
than that in any other similar book, and will be of inestimable value to teacher and pupil. The whole 
undertaking is one greatly to be welcomed for its scholastic excellence and for its utility to the teacher. 

Qovernment in State and Nation 

By J. A. James, Ph.D., Professor of History in Northwestern University, and A. H. 
Sanford, M.A., Professor of History in the Stevens Point, Wis., Normal School. 
12mo; 383 pages. $1.00 net. 

The authors have endeavored to present to teachers of Civil Government a book on the same plane with 
the best texts in History, Literature, and Science. Emphasis is placed upon the actual workings of the gov- 
ernment in its various departments, and prominence is given to practical problems of local government, such 
as arise in connection with elections, trials, taxation, and the like. The Suggestive Questions in connection 
with each chapter, and the multitude of references, giving not only the title of book or magazine, but the 
exact page, makes this an improvement over other texts on the subject. 

The Outlook says of it : " Fine in plan, in style, in scholarship, and in spirit. In treating every subject 
there is not only information as to how affairs are now being managed, but as to how progressive men 
think they should be managed, and there is also a bibliography referring to the best things to be read about 
it both in books and magazines. An admirable piece of work." 

Elementary Physical Geography 

An Outline of Physiography. By Jacques W. Redway, F.R.G.S. 12mo; with maps 
and colored plates; 383 pages. $1.25 net. 

This is an Elementary book; it is designed for high, normal, and secondary schools and not for the col- 
lege and university student. Thought questions, individual exercises, and field work are abundantly provided. 
The author's familiarity both with educational and geographic science makes the book unusually strong. 

Has displaced every other text on the subject in one place or another, and is everywhere giving the best 
of satisfaction. 

Journal of Education says : " Nowhere have Mr. Redway's knowledge and skill appeared to better 
advantage, to say the least, than in this book. The analysis of the subject is remarkably clear, scientific, 
and usable ; the arrangement of each chapter is pedagogical, with exercises and questions admirably pre- 
pared. The wealth of material is specially noticeable. In the final twenty-five pages are given the indus- 
trial regions and interests of the United States."

The Most Beautiful Book of Fiction of the Spring 
A STORY OF VIKING DAYS 

Cf)e Cljrall of Utit tl)e lucfep 

By OTTILIE A. LILJENCRANTZ. 

With six full-page illustrations in color, and many initials and ornamental designs, 

by Tkoy and Margaret West Kinney. 12mo, $1.50. 



SELDOM has one book shown so many qualities that attract fiction readers of all ages. For 
the older ones there is the fascination that a well-told narrative of love and daring should 
always possess, with the added element of an entirely new and unworked period of history as a 
background, and an indefinable vigor and freedom that is naturally associated with the Viking 
days. For younger readers it has the essential qualities of sincerity and perfect wholesomeness, 
with an historical interest no boy or girl can resist. Miss Liljencrantz has revived the spirit 
of Scott at his best, and her book is a unique contribution to American literature.

'T'HIS might be called a chapter in the life of the great Shakespearean scholar, being a collection of her letters 
* addressed to Mr. Robert Balmanno of Nevr York, whom she named " the Enthusiast." The correspondence began 
after the publication of her famous «< Concordance," and lasted from 1850 to 1861. Every effort has been made 
to make the illustrations, typography, and binding consistent with the literary interest of the work. 

" < Letters to an Enthusiast ' is of value to all lovers of literature, and of especial interest to those who wish 
to add to their library probably the only work published for fifty years which speaks familiarly of names famous 
in the last decade. The letters are personal in tone and abound iu interesting references to Hazlitt, Keats, 
Douglas Jerrold, Lamb, Leigh Hunt, Dickens, and Millais." — Kansas City Journal.

'^ short but comprehensive history of the art of short story writing, from the Decameron and the Arabian

edly literary appearance. Three books of Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Go.'s Spring List have been 
printed by Mr. Updike with notable success. They are small in size, most attractively bound

^-^ those whom most of us would consider best qualified to speak on the subject. Most of the advice given is of

"THE unique position and permanent value of Professor Baldwin's " Book Lover " among books of literary

by an equally useful book of the same kind. For this new edition the text has been entirely re-written, and

FIVE SPLENDID NOVELS 



" ^ truly great historical novel." — Omaha 
World-Herald. 

The Colonials 

By Allen French. 

A really good historical novel is bound to 
find recognition, and both the press and the 
public unite in giving "The Colonials" a very 
strong commendation, as is evidenced by the 
fact that five editions were printed in the first 
few weeks of its career. 

" It is seldom that we 
are favored with so strong, 
so symmetrical, so virile 
a work ... of an order 
of merit so superior to the 
common run that it may 
fairly be called great. ' The 
Colonials,' by every right, 
should prove one of the 
most successful novels of 
the year." — Brooklyn Eagle. 

Decorated from old prints.

31st Thousand in Three Weeks 



The Battleground 



Adele Marie Shaw. 
j1 romantic tale of the ad- 
venturous times ofJVilliam 
Phips, " The first self- 
made American." 
"The story of 'The Little Maid' and her 
pirate captors ; of her friendship with Roger ; 
of the suspicion which fell on her in the wild 
frenzy of the witchcraft craze, and of her five- 
hour trial before the 'great Mr. Mather' him- 
self; of her release from jail and her flight with 
Roger — is vastly interesting reading." — Brooklyn 
Standard- Union. 

With large maps of Old Boston. $1.^0. 



By Ellen Glasgow, 
Author of ♦* The Voice of the People." 

The N. T. Times Saturday Review 
says : " It has the rare charm of a 
most satisfactory heroine, one whom 
to know in real life would be a liberal 
education in womanly virtues. . . . 
Miss Glasgow has written a poetic 
tale of young love, but there have 
been others as admirable ; she has 
wonderfully well portrayed Southern 
society, but there, too, she has her 
compeers, though few ; but as a story 
of the civil war ' The Battleground' 
stands alone. Miss Glasgow ranks 
with Mr. Page as a painter and an 
interpreter of the Old South — and 
her negroes are as perfect as Mr. 
Harris's."

Democracy and Social Ethics 

By JANE ADDAMS, Hull House, Chicago. 
Cloth, $1.25 net. (Postage, 12 cents.) 

Miss Addams's Settlement Work in Chicago is known to everyone interested in social amelioration. 
Her writings show clear insight and practical wisdom, born of intimate knowledge of the conditions of which 
she writes. 

" Thoughtful readers all over the country have learned that any book from Miss Jane Addams of Hull 
House, Chicago, is sure to be full of serious interest and mental stimulus. . . . Its tone is one that com- 
mands respect for the author's heart as well as for her vigorous mind. It is a striking contribution to the 
fund of original research on the social problems of the day." — Record-Herald, Chicago. 

" Miss Addams is clear. She has not been precipitate in the preparation of her book. She has recon- 
sidered, corrected, and recorrected it, spoken with temperance and courtesy and with full appreciation of 
the efforts of the aspiring individualist, though she is herself no individualist, but a Socialist through and 
through. ... As gentle, as patient, as sincere, and as astute as Jane Addams herself is the philosophy set 
forth in these pages." — Tribune, Chicago.

An Inquiry into the Future Conditions of Human 
Society. 
By MICHAEL A. LANE, author of " Great Philos-

" He has hit upon a new law, a new way of look- 
ing upon man intellectually, socially, and morally, 
and he makes much of it, and deservedly so. . . . 
' The Level of Social Motion ' is a splendidly liberal 
education in life from its economic and moral side."

Western Civilization 

By BENJAMIN KIDD, author of "Social Evolu-

" Mr. Kidd's comparison of the economic methods 
existing in the various European countries and in the 
United States is pregnant with importance to stu- 
dents of our government and laws. . . . No more 
thoughtful and impressive study has been written 
than this." — The Philadelphia Ledger.

The Louisiana Purchase 

By Dr. JAMES K. HOSMER 

Author of " A History of the Mississippi Valley," etc. 
With Illustrations and Maps. 12[uo, cloth, $1.20 net (postage, 12 cts. additional.) 

Dr. Hosmer has written a thoroughly popular book. His story of the purchase of Louisiana, from the 
inception of French influence on this continent to the present development of the great States built up within the 
confines of the original Purchase, forms a most picturesque and striking narrative. There has been no account 
of the Louisiana Purchase which is so popular and constant in its interest, and the authoritative character of the 
historian's work renders the volume indispensable for all who wish to gain a thorough knowledge of the personal 
elements and the historic significance of its acquisition. While written for both younger and older readers, it 
provides a book especially needed at the present moment by young Americans.

THJS RHODE S BE NEFACTION. 

Not long ago, we were speaking of the 
agencies at work in our modern world whereby 
the cause of " international amity " was being 
advanced, and a year or so earlier, we made a 
few remarks concerning the form of " prescient 
philanthropy " which is wise enough to direct 
its efforts toward the future rather than con- 
fine them to the amelioration of present-day 
conditions. Had the noble gift of Cecil Rhodes 
to the English-speaking world then been fore- 
seen or realized, it would have provided a 
striking illustration for either of the two heads 
of our discourse. No better idea for the fur- 
thering of friendship between the nations could 
well be conceived than this plan to bring to- 
gether for educational purposes the picked 
youth of the two hemispheres, and no form of 
benefaction to the human race has ever exhib- 
ited more of that foresight which is the better 
part of all philanthropic endeavor. 

Briefly stated, as we understand it, the 
Khodes bequest provides that about a hundred 
young men from the United States, and per- 
haps fifty more from the British colonies and 
from Germany, shall each be given a three 
years' scholarship at the University of Oxford, 
and that others shall succeed them, upon like 
conditions, in perpetuity. The stipend offered 
is fifteen hundred dollars annually for each 
scholar, a generous provision, and ample for 
the purposes of a student at any of the Oxford 
colleges to which men repair with the intention 
of doing serious work. The delegation from 
the United States is to be made up of two 
students from each state and territory, thus 
being representative of every part of the coun- 
try. The conditions of the selection, more- 
over, are of such a nature as to insure the 
sending of a finely-equipped body of youths to 
the ancient city on the Isis. Cecil Rhodes was 
too much a man of the world to suppose that 
attainments of the strictly academic sort are 
all that are essential to the making of a man, 
and his bequest wisely provides that not schol- 
astic tests alone shall be applied in the selec- 
tion of his beneficiaries, but that these shall 
be supplemented by tests of character, and 



804

even of physical endowment, to an extent that, 
on the whole, subordinates the intellect to the 
sum total of the other qualities of manhood. 
The written examination is well as far as it 
goes, but it should not be made a fetich, and 
the testimonial of character, if it comes from 
an unimpeachable source, affords a better 
basis of choice. 

This may be thought to be begging the 
question, in view of the common and notorious 
abuse of testimonials, and the problem no doubt 
presents grave difficulties on this account, but 
we shall not we willing to call them insurmount- 
able until the plan has been given a fair trial. 
When the central administrative machinery of 
the trust shall have been set up, when all the 
necessary general officers and committees shall 
have been appointed, and when it comes to 
the actual selection of two Rhodes scholars 
from each of the states of this Union, — then, 
no doubt, the real crux of the problem will 
present itself. By what means shall the two 
young men be chosen, say, in the State of Illi- 
nois ? How shall the claims of the competi- 
tors be coordinated to insure that real merit, 
and not influence or favoritism, shall determine 
the selection? That the competition will be 
keen is quite certain ; these scholarships will 
be the great prizes of the educational world, 
partly because of the generous individual pro- 
vision made for them, and partly because of 
the marked distinction which their award will 
confer. When the intellectual tests have been 
applied, and the applicants have been reduced 
to a manageable number, the final decision 
will call for the most delicate weighing of 
claims, and the most absolute impartiality. It 
cannot properly be made by perfunctory meth- 
ods, it will have to be made by men who will 
take the task seriously, who can bring to it 
unusual powers of judgment and discrimina- 
tion, who are not to be imposed upon by the 
various forms of pretence and humbug that 
will clamor for their hearing and seek to con- 
trol their verdict. 

In this delicate matter of adjudication there 
are two extremes, both of which must be care- 
fully avoided. Too much weight must not be 
given to the opinion of any one person, nor 
must too much weight be given to merely nu- 
merical suffrages. Neither an arbitrary dictum 
nor a meaningless plebiscite must be the con- 
trolling element in the decision. To put the 
matter less abstractly, there is the danger, on 
the one hand, of deferring too much to the 
opinion of the executive head of some institu- 



tion of learning, and, on the other, of being 
unduly moved by an avalanche of certificates 
attesting the worth of some person who com- 
bines the instinct of the politician with that of 
the student. The executive head of a school 
or college usually knows less about the indi- 
vidual student than the instructor who has 
daily relations with him, and a recommendation 
from that source, not being made at first hand, 
is peculiarly liable to errors of judgment. In 
the case of the candidate in whose behalf many 
voices are raised, the quality of the suffrages 
is vastly more important than the quantity, 
and a keen insight into the motives which 
actuate ordinary human nature will recognize 
the majority of such recommendations as ab- 
solutely worthless. The opinions of politicians, 
journalists, clergymen, and " leading citizens " 
generally, are subject to large discounts, and 
should, in many cases, count rather against 
a candidate than in his favor. In short, the 
task of selection is one for which civil ser- 
vice commissions and examining boards of 
the ordinary type will not be likely to prove 
adequate ; it is a problem which will demand 
the devising of a more delicate form of ma- 
chinery than has hitherto been applied to such 
purposes. 

Educational opinion in this country has al- 
ready received a certain amount of expression 
on the subject of the Rhodes bequest, although 
there has not been time for a careful consid- 
eration of the conditions. The administrative 
difficulties of the project have been generally 
pointed out, but its larger aspects do not seem 
to have received adequate recognition. Most 
of the men who have thus far been persuaded 
into print belong to the class of what may be 
called our educational moguls ; in other words, 
the presidents of our larger universities have 
been interviewed by an enterprising press, and 
have placed their more or less valuable views 
upon record. But strictly speaking, this matter 
is one that does not concern the American 
university at all, except as it concerns the gen- 
eral interests of education. The Rhodes scholars 
are not to be sent by the universities, but by 
the high schools and academies. Hitherto, the 
American student who has gone to a European 
university has, almost without exception, gone 
there for advanced work, after having been 
graduated from some college in this country. 
But the intention of the Rhodes foundation is 
to offer an opportunity for undergraduate work 
to a lot of bright American boys from eighteen 
to twenty years of age. In spite of the obvious 



1902.] 



THE DIAL 



305 



inference from the terms of the bequest, our 
educational spokesmen have thus far very gen- 
erally taken for granted that the Rhodes scholars 
would be drawn from the ranks of our uni- 
versity students. This unwarrantable assump- 
tion must be disposed of before it is possible to 
take an intelligent view of the subject. Cecil 
Rhodes clearly intended that the young Ameri- 
cans sent to Oxford by his bequest should be 
of the same general age and class as the young 
Englishmen who go up to the university 
from the great public schools. Now the ana- 
logue of such a man in the United States 
is found, not in the student who has com- 
pleted, or even begun, his college course, but 
in the student who has just completed the 
work of some good high school or preparatory 
academy. 

It would be premature to make specific sug- 
gestions concerning the administration of this 
great trust until its terms are more fully known 
and more carefully studied. As far as its 
American administration is concerned, it seems 
that there must be a committee of some sort 
for the entire country, and probably a local 
committee for each of the States and Terri- 
tories. Assuming this to be the general plan, 
we should say that one conclusion of much 
importance follows from the considerations ad- 
duced in the foregoing paragraph. This con- 
clusion is the simple one that college and 
university interests should not have the pre- 
dominant voice in the administrative organiza- 
tion. University ofiicers should by no means 
be ignored in the constitution of the commit- 
tees, for the counsel of such men as Presidents 
Eliot, Gilman, and Jordan, Professors Norton, 
Sumner, and Gildersleeve, is too valuable to 
be missed; but the men who stand officially 
for the larger educational systems of States 
and cities, together with the men who stand 
for the secondary educational interest most 
directly affected by the Rhodes endow- 
ment, should prove the main reliance for its 
efficient administration. This consideration 
seems to us of vital importance, and may pro- 
perly be urged even at this early stage of the 
enterprise. 

There is a homely old saying about looking 
a gift-horse in the mouth, and another less 
homely one about viewing with suspicion the 
gifts of the Greeks. Both have been illus- 
trated by the published comments on the 
Rhodes bequest already made on this side of 
the water. One such comment goes so far as 
to propose "that some concerted action on thjB 



part of those interested in American educa- 
tion should be taken, and taken immediately, 
to prevent the acceptance of the Rhodes schol- 
arships." The provincial spirit which asks 
what we have " to do with abroad," and which 
" views with alarm " the possible contamina- 
tion of our youth by the " effete civilization " 
of Europe, is usually nothing more than amus- 
ing, but when it goes to such lengths as this 
it becomes vicious. That this rabid form of 
Anglophobia should be voiced by " lewd fel- 
lows of the baser sort " was inevitable, but that 
it should come from the mouths of educated 
men has surprised us not a little. As if the 
sending of thirty or forty boys to England 
every year for their college education could 
possibly be a menace to American ideals ! As 
if English society had not also its lessons for 
our own national life ! As if it were not the 
best thing in the world for a few of our young 
men to learn by an intimate personal experi- 
ence that Englishmen and Americans are essen- 
tially of the same race and have developed 
upon essentially similar lines ! It is a narrow 
prejudice indeed that would not welcome the 
opportunity of keeping a thousand of our 
young men, let alone a hundred, at school in 
England, to the broadening of our outlook and 
the strengthening of the tie that should ever 
bind us to the people who speak our parent 
language, with all that this implies in the way 
of common institutions and ideals. We wish 
only that some American philanthropist might 
feel his imagination fired by the magnificent 
idea of Cecil Rhodes, and might provide the 
means whereby a hundred picked English 
youths from Harrow and Eton and Rugby 
should always be enrolled among the students 
of Harvard University. We should then have 
the conditions for an interclange of sympa- 
thy and mutual respect that could not fail to 
be felt in both the great branches of our race. 
But we may well be thankful for what is 
already assured in this direction, while hoping 
for still further developments along the same 
general line of reciprocal helpfulness. In 
democracy is the hope of the world, and only 
England and America thus far among the 
nations have approached an understanding of 
the whole meaning of democracy. In both 
countries the advance of democracy has had 
its setbacks, and tolerated many irrational 
accidents, but in both has substantial progress 
been made toward what is in effect the same 
goal. We are convinced that the Rhodes 
foundation will contribute toward the realiza- 



806

tion of this fact, although we shrewdly suspect 
that the founder himself had quite other ideas 
upon the subject, — that he has, in short, 
builded better than he knew, as is often the 
case with the masterful persons who set the 
feet of men in new and untried paths. 



AN EARLIER APOSTLE OF AMERICAN 
CULTURE. 



Oar typical '* freshwater " college of to-day, with 
its dozen fairly specialized scholarly instructors and 
a few thousand books, is modest enough, and yet 
it usually gives a most misleading and exaggerated 
idea as to the same institution a century ago or 
more. In 1757, Jonathan Edwards hesitated to 
become president of Princeton, feeling " hardly 
competent to instruct the senior class in all studies." 
Two professors and two tutors made a tolerable 
faculty then. Hebrew, Greek, and Latin mostly 
patristic, logic, mathematics, — these were the 
staples. Modern languages, science, history, have 
since run the gauntlet into the curriculum, and En- 
glish literature is just coming painfully to its proper 
heritage. But, worst of all, every American col- 
lege in 1800 was but an ill-conducted school, where 
boys must merely recite the lessons conned from 
text-books. The Harvard library seemed respect- 
able to George Ticknor in boyhood, but when he 
returned from Gottingen he found it was but '' a 
closetful of books." Of the larger university ether 
he and Everett brought us the first whiff. 

Ticknor himself, son of a well-to-do ex-teacher 
and tradesman of Boston, was admitted to Dart- 
mouth College at ten, after oral tests at home in 
Cicero and New Testament Greek. Graduating at 
sixteen, after but two years actual residence, with 
a tincture of Horace and astronomy in his memory, 
he acquired in the next three years, from an English- 
born clergyman of Boston, some real acquaintance 
with such recondite authors as Homer, Herodotus 
and Euripides, Livy, and Tacitus. Madame de 
Stael's " Germany " told him of university life 
there. With much effort, he secured a German 
dictionary from another state, borrowed a German 
grammar written in French, and discovered in the 
suburban village of Jamaica Plain an Alsatian who 
could give him a very faulty pronunciation. Such 
were the conditions at Harvard and in Boston, 
a decade after the deaths of Friedrich Yon Schil- 
ler and Christian Gottlob Heyne. Mastery of Hot- 
tentot with the clicks, or the native speech of 
Samoa, could be more hopefully sought in Boston 
now. 

Ticknor sailed for Europe in April, 1815. Four 
years later he returned, with the richest intellectual 
results of study and travel and with a private 
library already large and costly. For many years 



he struggled, in vain, to have Harvard College re- 
modelled on something like its present lines. Only 
his friend Everett, the brilliant young Greek pro- 
fessor, shared Ticknor's German scholarship and 
progressive ideas ; and he, after four years, was 
sent to Congress. Ticknor only, as the first Smith 
professor of modern languages (1820-1835), had 
a real departmental staff of instructors, — a native 
German, an Italian, and a Frenchman. Of his 
own nominal stipend of a thousand dollars a year, 
he long drew only six hundred on account of the 
extreme poverty of the college. 

Mr. Ticknor's town house and library was for a 
half -century, even during his own long visits abroad, 
the scholarly centre of Boston (from which city 
Harvard has never been separable), perhaps also 
its strongest literary bulwark. Among his friends 
and correspondents he counted the greatest foreign 
scholars, like Humboldt, and King John of Saxony, 
the learned student of Dante. Ticknor himself 
was not a source of direct inspiration as a great 
teacher, orator, or creative writer; but all such 
men valued his influence. He was a wide-ranging 
and accurate student, all his life. His " History of 
Spanish Literature " (1849) is still the exhaustive 
and authoritative work on the subject, though any- 
thing but a readable or stimulating book for laymen. 
His life of Prescott gives us a pleasant acquaintance 
with the biographer as well, though both, of course, 
maintain their punctilious dignity and Boston man- 
ners. 

That Ticknor's tendencies, save in pure scholar- 
ship and educational reform, were conservative, 
aristocratic, exclusive, is not strange. He and his 
class were held closely bound by their material in- 
terests and social creed. The fast-growing wealth 
of Boston was heavily invested in the mills on the 
Merrimac. The South, rather than the West, then 
furnished the chief market. Even men who de- 
plored the existence of slavery — as nearly all men 
then did — might cling to the Union, and to the 
constitutional recognition of slaveholding as a bar- 
gain fairly entered into and irrevocable. So, when 
the most promising of young Boston aristocrats, 
like Phillips and Sumner, became Abolitionists, or 
even Free Soil revolters from the dominant Whig 
party, Ticknor's door was slammed in their faces, 
and nearly all " the four hundred," of course, imi- 
tated the example. (Prescott is said to have been the 
only exception.) When, from the time of Tiberius 
Gracchus to Henry George, has vested wealth wel- 
comed revolutionary doctrines, or petted their ex- 
pounders ? Far more bitterly did the older " ortho- 
dox " Unitarianism denounce the radical free 
religionist, Theodore Parker, as " an atheist in the 
pulpit," a fit ally for incendiary traitors like Garri- 
son. Professor Wendell is quite right in arguing 
that all this was not merely excusable or rational, 
but really inevitable. Though " Humanity sweeps 
onward," the cautious conservative has his peculiar 
virtues and uses. 



1902.] 



THE DIAL 



307 



It is important to remember that Emerson, and 
the younger creative writers generally, were openly 
following, though with feet less heavily shod, in the 
same paths with Garrison and Parker. Channing 
himself did not live long enough to grow the hard 
shell of real conservatism. On the other hand, 
such men as Felton, the great Greek professor, a 
life-long intimate friend of Sumner, denounced his 
radical politics far more hotly than Ticknor, and 
finally even broke off personal relations. Ticknor 
acted from calm life-long principle. That his own 
creed, political, social, and religious, was absolutely 
right, he knew as surely as Winthrop or Mather. 
His naive letter on this subject is printed in Pierce's 
life of Sumner, Vol. III. 

In truth, not merely the conservatism of property 
generally, but the very spirit of scholarship itself, 
is often at war with the creative imagination. The 
scholar lives, by his own choice, in the past ; the 
poet rather in his ideal — even if unattainable — 
iuture. So the scholar craves permanence, while 
the freer vision of the dreamer bids him hope, if 
not fight, for radically better conditions of life. 
These two powers are oftener not united, in large 
measure, in the same person. Encyclopaedic learn- 
ing weighs down the winged soul too heavily. 
Books abused, says Emerson, are among the worst 
■of things. " Meek young men in libraries "forget, 
he adds, that they to whom they make submission 
-were themselves but bolder and more self-centred 
youths. W. D. Whitney, or Justin Winsor, could 
have made a crushing retort, by describing the 
chronic inaccuracy of dreamers. Certainly Emer- 
son himself was quite unfit for sustained investi- 
gation and scholarly accuracy, though he could 
admire, in more tolerant moods, even the 
•bookworm. 

Lowell, it is true, did combine tireless energy as 
-a reader, an omnivorous memory, and reflective 
.analytical criticism, with the poet's imagination. 
Doubtless the critic profited by the partnership ; 
but the poet often, even in old age, complains bit- 
terly that arduous study has dried up the creative 
sources. His poetry might have been largely the 
gainer if he, like Longfellow, could have quietly 
-sought, and enjoyed all his life long, whatever sus- 
tenance his imagination craved ; or even had he 
been often secluded for years in villages or fields, 
with little comradeship save his own wide-ranging 
-thoughts. 

But poet and scholar, creator and preserver of 
our literary wealth, have need of each other ; and 
the truly civilized community itself needs alike the 
poet and the scholar, the uplift toward better things 
to strive for, the full consciousness of all the treas- 
ured experience and thought garnered from the 
centuries since Homer or the Vedic hymns. 

Ticknor first made liberal scholarship possible in 
an American college. In his later life he lent his 
costly books, with the utmost generosity, to every 
^serious student. He, more than any other man, 



labored to found the Free Public Library of Bos- 
ton, the oldest, and still the best, among such in- 
stitutions in America. To that library he bequeathed 
his own collection of Spanish books, said to be still 
the richest in the world, outside of Spain itself. 

Ticknor's name must be written, perhaps larger 
than any other, among the creators of a wide and 
deep literary culture, who are surely, in the long 
run, among the godfathers of later literature as 
well. This truth is demonstrable in his case. 
Emerson or Thoreau, though each owes much in 
detail to older authors, could indeed be essentially 
himself in his sylvan home. But Longfellow's 
world-wide humanism and Prescott's fine literary 
style were vitally indebted to George Ticknor, and 
to the new culture which his name best represents. 
They breathed naturally, all their lives, the air of 
the <<alcoved tomb," as Dr. Holmes calls the 
library. 

Moreover, culture, being closer to the earth, has 
a hardy local root which is denied to the imagina- 
tive faculty. The splendid poetic outburst which 
began with Emerson culminated in Lowell, — and, 
alas, is past. Our great poets and romancers are 
silent. The sweet minor singers of this our Lyr- 
ical Intermezzo may be found in Indiana or Cali- 
fornia quite as often as in New England. But for 
historical composition in particular, there is still 
one centre only ; and a short radius, sweeping from 
the gilded dome of Boston's State House, through 
Quincy, Jamaica Plain, and Cambridge, would in- 
clude nearly all the chief names of living or dead. 
To Ticknor, and to Franklin before him, — that is, 
to the collectors of books and founders of libraries, 
— this sturdiest and most advanced phase of our 
national scholarship is primarily due.

It is difficult to realize that Francis Richard 
Stockton, who died on the twentieth of April, had 
completed his sixty-eighth year. Irrepressible youth- 
fulness of spirit characterized his last work — the 
pirate romance of "Kate Bonnet" — even more dis- 
tinctly than some of his earliest writings. After a 
high school education in Philadelphia, the city of his 
birth, Stockton served his apprenticeship to literature 
by working for the newspapers, and an editorial con- 
nection with " Scribner's Monthly " and " St. Nicholas." 
Among his books the following may be mentioned : 
« The Lady or the Tiger," «« The Late Mrs. Null," 
" The Hundredth Man," " Adventures of Captain Horn," 
" Mrs. ClifE's Yacht," « The Girl at Cobhurst," « Rud- 
der Grange," " The Casting Away of Mrs. Leeks and 
Mrs. Aleshine," " The Dusantes," " Ardis Claverden," 
"The House of Martha," "The Associate Hermits," 
and " A Bicycle of Cathay." The list of his books is 
a long one, and they have provided innocent enter- 
tainment for a host of readers, both young and old. 
He had a whimsicality of invention which was all his 
own, yet he had also a power of serious characteriza- 
tion which assures him a modest niche in our permanent 
literature.

A Virginia Gextl.eman of Two 
Centuries Ago.* 



The writings of Colonel William Byrd of 
Virginia, now published in a beautifully- 
printed volume, consist of three long accounts 
or journals of life in the colony of Virginia in 
the early years of the eighteenth century. Of 
the three manuscripts, "The Progress to the 
Mines " is the most interesting, " A Journey 
to Eden " the most descriptive, and " The 
Dividing Line" the most valuable. In the 
latter work, the nomenclatory line was the 
boundary between Virginia and North Caro- 
lina ; and Colonel Byrd had the gratification of 
knowing that his surveying work was accepted 
by the Crown as final, — and it still remains 
so. He could state with equal satisfaction that 
the survey cost the Crown but one thousand 
pounds; to one who reads carefully the de- 
scription of the manner in which the work was 
done, this sum seems slight indeed. 

Byrd gives a truly dismal account of the 
famous Dismal Swamp ; saying that " it con- 
tained no living creature; neither Bird nor 
Beast, Reptile nor Insect came in our view." 
The Swamp at that time could scarcely have 
difiPered much from the Swamp to-day; and 
bears, deer, and wild- cats are now hunted 
there; snakes abound, and there is also very 
good fishing. The dark-colored water which he 
so abhorred, and zealously tempered with rum 
before drinking, was stained with juniper-root ; 
and to-day it is held in such high esteem for its 
healthfulness that folk send for it at great 
distances for medicinal use. 

Throughout Colonel Byrd's writings are 
many expressions verging on slang, and many 
words used in senses which had hitherto seemed 
to me distinctly modern. Thus : " The In- 
habitants wanted elbow-room "; " New York 
was a Limb lopt o£E of Virginia "; " To make 
a Slippery People as good as their Word "; 
the use of the word " lugg," meaning to carry ; 
and the constant use of the word (and doing 
of the deed) to " tip," meaning to give a petty 
sum for service rendered. The pages abound 
with terse sentiments of a dry humor, such as 
these : 

" They extended to Jamestown where like true En- 
glishmen they built a Church that cost no more than

over in Virginia Esqr." Edited by John Spencer Bassett.

Fifty Pounds, and a Tavern that cost Five Hundred." 

" Nothing is dear here but Law, Physick, and Strong 
Drink, which are all bad of their Kind." 

" The Leaves had a fresh agreeable smell, and Ladies 
would be apt to fancy a Tea made of them provided 
they were told how far it came, and at the same time 
were oblig'd to buy it very Dear." 

" My Landlady received us with a grim Sort of wel- 
come which I did not expect, since I brought her Hus- 
band back in good Health, tho' perhaps that might be 
the Reason." 

" It had rained so little for many weeks that the 
Naides had hardly Water enough left to wash their 
Faces." 

The writer gives a very spirited description 
of the house of Colonel Spottswood, showing a 
luxury hardly to be expected in such a remote 
plantation in a new colony and new world. 

" Mrs. Spotswood received her old Acquaintance with 
many a gracious Smile. I was carry'd into a Room 
elegantly set off with Pier Glasses, the largest of which 
came soon after to an odd Misfortune. Amongst the 
favorite Animals that cheer'd this Lady's Solitude, a. 
Brace of Tame Deer ran familiarly about the House 
and one of them came to stare at me as a Stranger. 
But unluckily Spying his own Figure in the Glass, he 
made a Spring over the Tea Table that stood under it,, 
and shatter'd the Glass to pieces ; and falling back 
upon the Tea Table made a terrible Fracas among the 
China. This Exploit was so sudden and accompany'd 
with such a Noise that it surpriz'd me and perfectly 
frighten'd Mrs. Spotswood. But 'twas worth all the 
Damage to shew the Moderation and good Humour 
with which she bore this Disaster. In the Evening the 
noble Colo, came home from his Mines, who saluted me 
very civilly, and Mrs. Spotswood's Sister, Miss Theky, 
who had been to meet him en Cavalier, was so kind too 
as to bid me welcome. We talkt over a Legend of 
Old Storys, supp'd about 9, and then prattled with the 
Ladys till 'twas time for a Travellour to retire." 

We may well reprint this posthumous testi- 
mony to the amiability of a colonial dame who 
in such a wilderness could meet the destruction 
of her beautiful pier glass and tea equipage 
with " moderation and good humour." 

The best pages of these journals are those 
which tell of the Virginia colonel himself ; he 
enters into very candid personal detail in a man- 
ner which at once reminds the reader of Pepys 
and his diary. Byrd had the same fresh- 
springing and frank interest in " the Fair Sex " 
which was ever displayed by the great English 
diarist ; but he had also a devoted love for his 
wife and children. His pages have no gross- 
ness save the inevitable free-and-easy speaking 
of the life and literature of his day, — the free 
speaking of Franklin ; and indeed he equals 
Franklin in his art of writing forceful, lucid, 
and charming English. The settlers of Vir- 
ginia and New York, albeit they were men of 
culture and parts, seldom kept diaries, nor did

they write ample or many letters. New En- 
gland Puritans delighted in committing their 
sentiments to paper, especially the depths of 
their religious life, hence we have many records 
to con to learn of early days in New England ; 
but Virginia life in contemporary years would 
have little original personal record were it not for 
these truly valuable manuscripts of William 
Byrd, which Professor Moses Coit Tyler has 
termed " one of the most delightful literary leg- 
acies which that age has handed down to us." 

The carefully worded epitaph engraved upon 
Byrd's tomb presents the best epitome of his 
life. From it we learn of the ample fortune he 
inherited from a father of the same name, who 
was a prosperous trader, planter, and politician, 
and founder of that noble estate, Westover-on- 
the- James; we hear of his education in En- 
gland, and his intimacy there with folk of 
knowledge, wit, high birth, and public station. 
We learn of his further education in the Low 
Countries and France ; and then of his career 
of success in his native land, where he became 
Receiver -General, was for thirty -seven years 
a member of the Council, and finally became 
its President. He was a man of pleasure, as 
his writings plainly show ; and though the epi- 
taph pronounces him a "splendid Economist," 
the records of his life scarcely prove this, — 
at least in any sense of the word "economy" 
which we now recognize. His intimacy with 
the Earl of Orrery, and his election to the 
Royal Society, kept him in touch with many 
things of scholarly interest in England. He 
married two wives, whom he dearly loved, and 
had several children ; one was " Beautiful 
Evelyn Byrd," whose name has of late ap- 
peared in more than one historical tale, — 
notably in Miss Johnston's "Audrey." 

The pages of William Byrd's Journals show 
a distinct scholarliness, — and especially a 
familiarity with the natural history of all lands. 
They evince, too, a capacity for intelligent 
comparison, and for drawing of useful and in- 
teresting deductions from what he saw. His 
observations are stated without pedantry, in a 
simple mode of assertion which is not only 
pleasing but convincing. Byrd was a skilled 
botanist, with a great love of flowers and trees ; 
he made constant study of the curative quali- 
ties of the wild plants he found, eagerly in- 
quiring of the Indians, and experimenting on 
his patient friends, both savage and civilized. 
Like many of his neighbors in Virginia, he 
thus acquired considerable skill in medicine. 
He corresponded with such famous botanists 



as Mark Catesby and Sir Hans Sloane, and his 
library gives evidence of his love and study of 
medicine and medicinal plants. He had an 
entire book-case of medical and pathological 
works, — pharmacopoeias, dispensatories, herb- 
als, and botanies, and two hundred or more books 
on special diseases or special treatments of di- 
sease. He was therefore far better equipped, 
and probably far more experienced, than the 
regular practitioners of medicine in the Vir- 
ginian colony. 

Of what he called " French Books of En- 
tertainment," Colonel Byrd had a charming 
collection, — one that would to-day be deemed 
well-chosen and ample. Books of travel, his- 
tory, and romance were plentiful upon his 
shelves, together with many volumes of divin- 
ity (as became a Christian gentleman of the 
Church of England), and a wonderfully good 
collection of " Classicks." There were, in all, 
over four thousand volumes, — the best edi- 
tions in the best bindings ; and kept in twenty- 
three handsome book-cases of carved walnut. 
These books were sold in 1777. 

The estate of twenty-six thousand acres 
which William Byrd inherited from his father 
did not long satisfy a man in whose veins 
burned the land-fever common to all Virginia 
colonists. He hungered for the vast tracts of 
river land which he saw during his survey of 
the Dividing Line in 1728, and he soon ac- 
quired twenty thousand acres of the " Land of 
Eden " described in his second monograph. 
Mile after mile was added, till at his death he 
owned over one hundred and seventy thousand 
acres of the best land in Virginia. He planned 
to establish colonies on these extensive pos- 
sessions, — one a colony of thrifty Swiss set- 
tlers ; but this scheme was never accomplished. 

The impression made upon us of the author 
of these journals is that of an intelligent gen- 
tleman and a kindly friend. A sensible man, 
too, he must have been, never running to 
extremes, nor credulously accepting every- 
thing told him ; a pleasant companion of un- 
varying good temper and cheerfulness, under 
privations and annoyances which must have 
been hard for one of his temperament and 
breeding to bear. This tribute of appreciation 
we give to the journal-keeper ; though the jour- 
nal itself rather than its writer is of consider- 
ation to us to-day. But we can never, even 
after two centuries, wholly disassociate an au- 
thor from his work. 

In outward form this reprint of Colonel 
Byrd's writings is a truly elegant volume, of

suitable size and perfect paper and typography ; 
and it is edited in the most satisfying manner. 
The introductory sketch of the Byrd family, 
and the ample yet concise notes, are precisely 
what the student (and the careless reader as 
well) can appreciate. It is not to be doubted 
that the editor, Mr. John Spencer Bassett, 
found his task a pleasant one, for he has im- 
pressed his enthusiasm and thoroughness upon 
his readers. 

A reviewer must hesitate at too lavish praise 
of a book, especially if the author be living, 
lest it seem fulsome ; but the interest in this 
volume as literature, and its value as history, 
are too absolute to admit of hesitation ; it 
affords to critic and to reader that unusual 
treat — a book without a fault ; and it is pos- 
sessed of every positive virtue possible to a 

work of its nature. . •., t,

The Jesuits in Paraguay.* 

Of the countries which, in the sixteenth 
century, came into the possession of Spain 
through Papal Bulls, through the Treaty of 
Tordesillas, through discoveries, exploration, 
occupancy or settlement, the vast region sur- 
rounding the Rio de la Plata and its tributaries 
in South America was placed in a somewhat 
different category from all the others. The 
geological formation of this region was imme- 
diately seen to give no promise of rich gold- 
mines as a reward for hardships most certainly 
to be endured by those who would take pos- 
session thereof; and after the search was 
abandoned for a waterway by which direct 
communication might be obtained with the west 
coast of the continent, the Spaniards — being 
not yet ready to appreciate the advantages the 
country offered for cattle and horse-raising — 
passed it by. There was nothing to attract 
adventurers save the facilities the country 
offered for those engaged in the nefarious pur- 
suit of slave-catching. Consequently towns 
were few and unimportant. 

That part of the country which bore the 
name of Paraguay was, early in the seven- 
teenth century, an out-lying province of the 
Spanish Viceroyalty of Peru ; and communica- 
tion with Spain was about as easy as with the 
capital of the Viceroyalty. The government of

that province was ill-regulated, and the charac- 
ter of the Spanish settlers far from admirable. 
Included within the Province was a region of 
indefinite extent, lying on both sides of the 
Tropic of Capricorn, and bearing then, as it 
does still, the name of El Gran Chaco. The 
Indians of the Chaco region were not like the 
Incas of Peru, but were of the nomadic Pam- 
pas tribes, the Guaranis being the most im- 
portant. 

When, early in the seventeenth century, 
Acquaviva, General of the Society of Jesuits, 
determined upon a remodeling of the system 
previously employed by his Order for the civ- 
ilization and evangelization of the Indians, he 
selected Paraguay as a suitable ground for the 
trial of his chief experiment. Possibly the 
principal point in its favor was the paucity of 
Spanish population, which in every other part 
of the New World had run counter to the 
plans of the missionaries. Leaving only so 
many missionaries in other parts of the conti- 
nent as were absolutely necessary, the mem- 
bers of his Order gathered the Indians from 
El Gran Chaco into towns or communal vil- 
lages, called Reductions (Reducciones)^ and 
taught them the simple arts of civilization 
and some of the rites and duties of the Christ- 
ian religion. 

Within thirty years this system embraced 
twenty Reductions, averaging a thousand fam- 
ilies each. Later, there were forty -seven Reduc- 
tions, in which 300,000 Indian families were 
being trained to habits of industry and good 
order ; and the number was even far greater 
when, in 1767, the Jesuit system was replaced 
by another under which the missions rapidly 
declined, the villages were abandoned, the 
churches (some of them no mean specimens of 
architecture, we are assured) were left to de- 
cay, and the Indians went back to the wild life 
from which the Jesuits had with great diffi- 
culty previously won them. 

In the century and a half of the Jesuit 
occupancy of this over-looked corner of the 
world, there was accumulated a wealth of his- 
torical material to which scant justice has 
hitherto been done. The Jesuit Reductions, 
as an experiment in social economics, have not 
received the attention they deserve. The few 
writers upon economic subjects who have re- 
ferred to them at all, have presented such 
incomplete and contradictory views of the Jes- 
uits' system as to destroy their value as illus- 
trations. The annals of that period are filled 
with heroic names, and episodes of thrilling

interest, which it would be the glory of the 
historian to rescue from oblivion. 

Mr. R. B. Cunninghame Graham, whose in- 
terests in Paraguay a quarter of a century ago 
appear to have been generally other than liter- 
ary, claims no skill as a historiographer, yet 
evinces some very important qualities of the 
historian, in his work entitled " A Vanished 
Arcadia." He has an appreciation of the value 
of historical material ; he is a close observer, 
and he has a keen sense of humor. His style 
is at times epigrammatic, he is inclined to in- 
dulge himself in sarcasm, and he finds in re- 
cent events in Africa analogies for events 
which his researches in Paraguayan affairs 
reveal. With sympathies for the Jesuits and 
their work awakened by viewing, in the course 
of his journeys in Paraguay, the ruins of the 
Reductions, he has pursued a thorough investi- 
gation of the history of the missions in the 
works of Spanish and French historians, an- 
nalists, and archivists. He finds a justification 
for the title he has chosen for his narrative of 
the Jesuit missions, in the happy Arcadian life 
which the Reductions inspired during their in- 
tervals of immunity from the incursions of 
slave-hunters, rival religious orders, or jealous 
government officials. At such times the happy 
neophytes were marshalled to their daily tasks 
by merry peals upon church-bells, and went to 
the fields in procession to the sound of music 
and headed by holy images. At mid-day they 
sang hymns, and enjoyed dinner and a siesta 
before resuming their work ; and at sun-down 
they returned to their abodes in the village in 
procession, singing as they had gone forth in 
the morning. In their leisure hours they were 
regaled with church ceremonies, and an abun- 
dance of music, dancing, and merry-making. 

It is upon the vanishing of this well-depicted 
Arcadia that the author lays the greatest stress. 
Not only does he narrate the circumstances at- 
tending the expulsion of the Jesuits from Par- 
aguay in 1767, but he fully discusses, with no 
little show of indignation, the injustice of the 
treatment accorded to them. 

The book is a valuable contribution to his- 
torical literature, and every reader must be 
grateful to the author for having rescued from 
oblivion the thrilling episodes he relates. It 
is not without its faults, however. Its index 
could have been more helpful if it had included 
more than a list of the capitalized proper names 
found upon each page, or even if it had in- 
cluded all of those. A few errors of dates are 
excusable after the author's apology therefor. 



The value of the book as a guide to the flora 
and fauna of the region of which he treats 
would have been enhanced if he had given some 
of the English equivalents of the Paraguayan 
names he uses so glibly. It seems strange that, 
in spite of all his careful research, he should 
be unable to explain that the name Mamelucos 
was given to the half-breed desperadoes of 
Brazil because of their resemblance to the 
Egyptian Mamelukes ; and he might have told 
us that the term " Reduction " was applied to 
the Jesuit missions, because the Indians were 
therein reduced to order and civilization, — a 
picturesque choice of a word for such a use 
among a people whose minds were much ab- 
sorbed by the process of reduction by which 
the precious metal was obtained from the ore.

A Century of Netv England 
Eloquence.* 

Ever since its foundation in 1805, " for 
friendship, charity, and mutual assistance," the 
New England Society of New York City — the 
first of its kind in America — has been ac- 
customed to celebrate Forefathers' Day, gen- 
erally with a banquet followed by toasts and 
the singing or recitation of original verses. 
Until 1857 the dinner was preceded by a public 
oration delivered by a distinguished member 
of the Society or an honored guest ; and it is 
these speeches, together with one or two written 
since for special occasions, that Mr. Cephas 
Brainerd, a valued member of the Society, and 
his daughter have collected and edited. The 
result is two volumes of undoubted interest 
and significance. Together they contain, 
besides a picturesque account of the founding 
of the Society and an introductory sketch of 
each speaker, some twenty-five addresses by 
twenty- four gifted orators. The one name that 
appears twice is fitly that of Daniel Webster. 
Issued primarily for the Society, a century of 
whose yearly deliberations they record, these 
volumes address themselves to all who look 
back with pride to a Puritan ancestry, to those 
who love the resounding eloquence struck by 
a skilful hand from a great theme, and, further, 
to those who, believing that civic virtues and 

national ideals and responsibilities are as real

as individual ODes, are sensible that it is after 
all only history with her suggestive questions 
and comparisons that can " make men wise." 

The Puritans, of course, as main theme or 
point of departure, are the subject of every 
speech ; and however well the reader may know 
his history of New England's colonization he 
can hardly fail to get here some new side light 
upon that heroic period of the nation's story. 
Among the earlier speakers, the first two of 
whom entitle their addresses sermons, the 
emphasis is upon the religious aspect of the 
Puritan movement, with the moral for the 
present generation sometimes unpleasantly ob- 
trusive. In the later addresses the dispassion- 
ate historical tone prevails, and they are cor- 
respondingly more urbane, if no less pointed, 
as to present-day issues. For example. Dr. 
Gardiner Spring's famous " Tribute to New 
England " — the sermon for 1820 and the first 
that was preserved — deals with the divine lead- 
ing behind the Puritan settlement and with the 
beneficent effect of that settlement on literature, 
on religious liberty and on the influence and 
extension of religion, in America. A sharp 
distinction is drawn between religious liberty 
and religious license, which, according to this 
Calvinistic divine, was being advocated by the 
Unitarians, who are represented as veritable 
wolves in the fold of truth. This was one of 
several addresses to evoke warm discussion, 
and the caustic reply drawn up by the outraged 
Unitarian minority is printed after the sermon. 
In sharp contrast is such an address as that of 
Dr. Storrs for 1867, which is direct, specific, 
and cogently pointed in its suggestions for a 
reversion to Puritan principles, but which is 
not barbed, and that in spite of the great con- 
troversy looming ahead. 

The uniqueness of the Pilgrim fathers is 
perhaps the dominant historical note of the 
series. Never came settlers to any land against 
such overwhelming odds or with such strange 
motives. Never was a colonial government so 
nobly planned. And as their reasons for coming 
to America were strange, so were the results 
they sought to achieve in their colony altogether 
foreign, in their strong accent upon spiritual- 
ity, to anything hitherto attempted. Other 
speakers prefer to go back of 1620 in order to 
trace the complicated course of events that 
differentiated the English reformation from 
the Europ^ean and led to the ostracism of these 
Protestants of the Protestants from their En- 
glish homes. Still others "call attention to the 
influence upon the movement of the Geneva 



exiles, who had a chance to see a republican 
government in actual operation. A few speak- 
ers choose to consider the idiosyncrasies of the 
Puritans, — men as unique in their faults as 
in their virtues, — and to show the fallacies in 
the popular conception of the Pilgrims as sour- 
faced, iron-handed, hard-hearted bigots, whom 
happily their descendants have ceased to re- 
semble. All seem to be agreed that New En- 
gland is still, in some measure at least, repre- 
sentative of the Puritan spirit ; and all unite 
in praising the part she has played in the 
making of the nation. But enough of gener- 
alities. It is the specific in these speeches that 
attracts ; the detail that supports each familiar 
generalization that is of value. And for that 
the reader must go beyond a brief review to 
the book itself. 

There is necessarily some repetition of 
thought in so long a series on a single theme, 
but one can easily see why the Society wished 
to publish all, if any, of the available addresses. 
Besides, there is not one that does not make 
its individual contribution to the whole, that 
does not reach towards the high standard set 
by such men as Webster, Storrs, and Evarts, 
Holmes, Hopkins, Curtis, Choate, and Emer- 
son. Most of the orations have not been pub- 
lished before except in rare pamphlets ; and 
merely as examples of forensic literature they 
are well worthy of the honor now paid them 
by the Society that called them forth. 

Yet it is not as eloquent tributes to a van- 
ished past that these orations are most vitally 
interesting, but rather as comments on their 
own time, as records of national progress 
through the century just ended, and as pro- 
phecies, warning yet hopeful, of the nation's 
future. Slavery, the great problem of the 
period, is touched upon by almost every speaker. 
At first it is handled with truly Puritanical 
sternness, then more guardedly, with a gentle- 
ness born of greater knowledge of the magni- 
tude of the issue and the delicate position of 
the contestants, but with no less depth of feel- 
ing. This apparent growth of tolerance since 
1820 and 1822, when the Unitarian contro- 
versy was raging bitterly, or even since 1842, 
when the dread of Catholic supremacy ex- 
pressed itself in unmeasured terras, can scarcely 
be understood as a chance result due to the 
individual temperaments of the various speak- 
ers. It rather represents a general change of 
attitude, a recognition of the modern tenet that 
the foe's conviction may be as sincere and his 
motives as worthy as one's own, and that in

any case nothing is to be gained by ungraciously 
insisting that he is altogether in the wrong. 

But to plume ourselves on the possession of 
this one virtue of tolerance in somewhat greater 
measure than our forefathers is to take but one, 
and that the smallest, view of a great theme. 
Not the little we might teach them, but the 
much that we should learn from them, and 
often have not, is the significant phase of the 
subject. And this is the unifying thread that 
runs through all these sermons and addresses 
and makes them of lasting value and real im- 
port for us, Puritans by descent it may be, but

Recent Books out the Trust Problem.* 



A prominent Washington o£B.cial well-known 
in statistical circles recently remarked, in a 
conversation, that " the people do not care a 
rap about trusts." Opposed to this rather 
effete summary of a great question are the nu- 
merous editorials, magazine articles, and books 
on the subject now coming from the public 
press. The three volumes reviewed in the pres- 
ent article reflect the seriousness of the prob- 
lem and by no means bear out the indifference 
of the Washington official. 

Fundamentally, the problem is the old one 
of monopoly, — and a very sharp distinction 
must be made between capital centralization 
and monopoly, so often confused in the pres- 
ent controversy. The first book, Le Rossig- 
nol's "Monopolies, Past and Present," both by 
title and contents gives evidence 'of careful 
thought on these essential points in the prob- 
lem. The author of " Commercial Trusts," 
however, takes it for granted that the attack 
on capital is due to centralization when in 
reality it is a question, as already pointed out, 
of monopoly. It is, however, to Clark's " The 
Control of Trusts " that we must look for a 
definite programme in dealing with the ques- 
tions involved in the trust. 

About the word " monopoly," then, clusters 
much of the discussion. To it each of the three

writers contributes a different definition. In 
" Monopolies, Past and Present " we are told 
that " a monopoly is the control of the supply 
or the demand of an economic good, by one per- 
son or a combination of persons, to such an ex- 
tent that that person or combination of persons 
is able to control the price of the economic 
good." To this definition Mr. Dos Passos ob- 
jects vigorously, declaring that a monopoly is 
" an exclusive privilege, resting in the hands of 
one person or corporation, to the exclusion of 
everybody else, and to comprehend a monopoly 
you must realize that there can exist no mo- 
nopoly, unless it is exclusive"; which, if ac- 
cepted, virtually excludes all monopoly dis- 
cussion from the field of inquiry. We are still 
to look at the definition of the third writer, 
who puts it clearly and strongly, that " to dom- 
inate weak rivals and to prevent strong ones 
from appearing, is to perform the act and to 
take on the character of a monopoly." That 
this is after all the fighting interpretation of the 
term, rather than the control of prices alone, 
is borne out by the recent events in the cele- 
brated Northern Pacific merger. 

Three methods of solving the monopoly 
question and all that it involves are found in 
the laissez faire doctrine, socialism, and state 
regulation. Each has its advocates, the second 
lacking an exponent, however, in the trio of 
books under review. The " let alone " policy 
is vigorously maintained by the author of 
" Commercial Trusts," who says, " I claim that 
the natural laws of trade form a sufficient bar- 
rier to prevent or break up most commercial 
monopolies." Since exclusive possession is the 
essential element, no monopolies exist from his 
point of view. It is just here that Professor 
Clark parts company, if he may be said to 
have kept company at all, with the orator be- 
fore the Industrial Commission. There is, on 
the contrary, always existent either actual or 
potential competition in every case of monopoly 
which cannot long continue without the aid of 
the state. Certain it is that we cannot rely 
upon the unaided forces of trade laws to pre- 
vent the abuses of monopoly. The laissez faire 
doctrine must give way to modern experience. 

In just so far as we confuse centralization 
and monopoly will our drift be toward social- 
if the darkness of the present hides the 



ism 



benefits of private property and individual ini- 
tiative, the more we shall look for state owner- 
ship as the only solution. Both the author of 
■"Monopolies, Past and Present," who clearly 
shows that we are dealing with a very old

problem in a new form, and the author of 
" The Control of Trusts " have brighter things 
than a regime of state socialism in store for us. 
They regard state control as the means of 
retaining the good in the modern system and 
eliminating the evils. 

The thesis of Mr. Le Rossignol's book may 
be stated in the author's own words. 

" The world moves in advancing cycles. First we 
have the monopolistic spirit of the Middle Ages. Then 
we have the competitive spirit of the industrial revo- 
lution. Again we pass into a period of monopoly and 
restriction of competition. In the first period we find 
public control and regulation of industry. In the 
second period we have the system of industrial liberty. 
May it not be that we are returning to a system of 
public control like and yet unlike that of ancient and 
mediaeval times? The doctrine of the Canonists re- 
vive in the teachings of the modern Socialists. The 
ideals resume their sway over the human mind, new in 
form but old in spirit. As ever, they demand recogni- 
tion, they call for realization." 

It is is certainly pleasant to think that ideals 
are to predominate over commercialism. Just 
how this is to come about our author does not 
say, but in an able manner he points out the 
history, experience, dangers, and advantages of 
various forms of monopoly, ending his volume 
with the admonition that " there is no need for 
extreme haste." 

A more positive programme is outlined in 
Professor Clark's little book, whose thesis is 
put in this way : 

" Monopoly power that is increasing and restrictions 
that are diminishing in force point to a time when 
something will have to be done in defence of property 
rights, if not personal liberty. The measures that it is 
possible to take are not many, but we shall soon see 
what they are, and try to make a selection from among 
them. Even now we can discern the principle which 
must dominate a sound policy in dealing with trusts. 
That principle is, first of all, to keep competition alive." 

But how is this result to be accomplished? 
Certainly not by the repeal of the tariff, 
advocated so noisily by the press of the day. 
The problem is by no means so easy as that. 
In many instances the tariff sustains not only 
the trust but the industry itself. In such cases 
competition, the fundamental principle of the 
thesis, is destroyed. In fact, so far as the in- 
dependent producer is sustained by the tariff, 
it would be unwise to hastily remove it. 

This view, then, maintains that tariff revis- 
ion is an end to be secured, not a means of 
solving the trust problem. When once the 
monopolistic element is taken out of the trust 
it will be possible to do something with the 
tariff, otherwise an attack on the tariff throws 
the trust and the independent producers into 
the same rank under the fortunes of war. The 



great danger is that a corporation exacting a 
monopoly price at home may treat its export 
business as a secondary matter. To avoid this, 
monopoly power must be broken before a tariff 
war begins. 

The number of steps necessary to such a 
procedure are not numerous, though difficult : 
First, protection of the investor ; second, fair 
treatment of the independent producers by the 
railroads. This latter step will require pooling 
and government control. From Professor 
Clark's point of view the key to the solution 
lies in the fact that the independent producer 
is a natural protector of all the other threatened 
interests. To withdraw the tariff is to destroy 
him, to maintain the tariff for the time regula- 
ting railroad discriminations is to give him a 
chance to exist. Certainly Professor Clark's 
book has great value in the warning clearly 
pointed out against a wrong beginning. . 

All three of the writers believe in the trust 
as a form of organization. The question is. 
Can it not be deprived of its dangerous ele- 
ments and made a source of advancement to 
the community ? Professor Clark believes that 



this can be done.

other hand, it was clearly the work of a man who 
cared little for technique, who was willing to ride 
roughshod over most of the canons of verse-rhetoric, 
and to whom the hest will in the world could not 
attribute the gift of the singing voice. The recent 
appearance of Mr. Hardy's second and larger vol- 
ume, entitled " Poems of the Past and the Present," 
justifies, with some slight modifications, these con- 
clusions based upon the earlier collection, and at 
the same time deepens our respect for the intellect 
which is here at work. For it is as an intellectual 
force that this volume must be measured, if any- 
thing like justice is to be done it. Every one of 
these poems has something to say, and usually it is 
something so well worth saying that defects in the 
manner of the expression may fairly be overlooked. 
Mr. Hardy has an abundance of ideas; many of 
them are poetical ideas in the strictest sense, and 
all of them are ideas of the sort that come only to 
the man who has meditated deeply upon the most 
serious problems of human existence. An illustra- 
tion may be introduced at this point of the discus- 
sion. From the Psalmist to the philosopher of 
KOnigsberg, the insignificance of earth and all the 
works of man when contrasted with the vastness of 
the creation has been a theme to provoke perplexed 
questionings and inspire an awful solemnity of 
soul. It is so big a theme that the small poet who 
ventures upon it is bound to be luckless, for the 
best he can o£Per will be but a weak solution of the 
idea. Yet Mr. Hardy can take so old an idea as 
this, and give it a restatement that is deeply im- 
pressive. The sonnet written " At a Lunar Eclipse " 
will, we believe, bear out this assertion. 

" Thy Shadow, Earth, from Pole to Central Sea, 
Now steals along upon the Moon's meek shine 
In even monochrome and curving line 
Of imperturbable serenity. 

'* How shall I link such sun-oast symmetry 
With the torn troubled form I know as thine, 
That profile, placid as a brow divine. 
With continents of moil and misery ? 

" And can immense Mortality but throw 
So small a shade, and Heaven's high human scheme 
Be hemmed within the coasts yon arc implies ? 

*' Is such the stellar gauge of earthly show. 
Nation at war with nation, Brains that teem, 
Heroes, and women fairer than the skies ? " 

Mr. Hardy is much preoccupied with the vanishing 
faiths of the past, and looks back with a certain 
wistfulness to the time when men could find conso- 
lation in what the clear intelligence of to-day must 
look upon as myth and baseless legend. 

"In days when men had joy of war, 
A God of Battles sped each mortal jar ; 
The peoples pledged him heart and hand. 
From Israel's land to isles afar." 

" I said to Love, 
' It is not now as in old days 
When men adored thee and thy ways] 

All else above ; 
Named thee the Boy, the Bright, the One 
Who spread a heaven beneath the sun," 
I said to Love." 



Mars and Eros are now no more, and with them 
the other gods have taken flight. One thinks of 
Schiller's plaint upon the same theme, but one 
misses the invincible optimism of Schiller, who 
could find new consolations in the newly awakened 
hopes of mankind, and in the revolutionary gospel 
of human brotherhood. Mr. Hardy's vision is too 
keen and his logic too relentless to permit him to 
resort to such anodynes. The bright new day that 
seemed to be dawning for mankind at the opening 
of the nineteenth century was overhung with dark- 
ness at the close of that century. How it seemed 
to Mr. Hardy just as the century was going out may 
be gathered from this *' Christmas Ghost Story '* 
of 1899 : 

" South of the Line, inland from far Durban, 
A mouldering soldier lies — your countryman. 
Awry and doubled up are his gray bones. 
And on the breeze his puzzled phantom moans 
Nightly to clear Canopus : * I would know 
By whom and when^the All-Earth-gladdening Law 
Of Peace, brought in by that Man Crucified, 
Was ruled to be inept, and set aside ? 
And what of logic or of truth appears 
In tacking " Anno Domini " to the years ? 
Near twenty-hundred liveried thus have hied. 
But tarries yet the Cause for which He died.' " 

Mr. Hardy comes very near to being a pessimist. 
This word is so often misapplied — to impatient 
idealists of the Ibsen type, for example, who in- 
dignantly scourge the profaners of the Temple for 
its more speedy cleansing — that we hesitate to use 
it, but of Mr. Hardy it must be said that he discerns 
but slight hope for the future of the race. He 
comes no nearer to such a vision of promise than 
in the doubtful prophecy of these lines : 

" When shall the saner softer polities 
Whereof we dream have play in each proud land, 
And patriotism, grown Godlike, scorn to stand 
Bondslave to realms, but circle earth and seas?" 

Even the qualified hopefulness of this suggestion 
is rarely met with. The spirit of the poet's own 
relentless motto, 

" Let there be truth at last, 
Even if despair," 

urges his thought implacably to the absolute pes- 
simism of such a poem as »' His Immortality," or 
of such a stanza as this concluding one of '< De 

Profundis ": 

" Black is night's cope ; 
But death will not appal 
One who, past doubtings all. 
Waits in unhope." 

Meanwhile, allowing the question of the future to 
be just barely debatable, the present is clearly out 
of joint. The group of war-poems, one of which 
has just been quoted, makes the poet's opinion clear 
enough, and it is still further enforced by a revery 
at Lausanne, in which the spirit of the historian to 
whom the place is consecrated puts these questions : 

" ' How fares the Truth now!? — 111 ? 
— Do pens but slily further her advance^? 
May one not speed her but in phrase askance ? 
Do scribes aver the Comic to be Reverend stilli?

[May 1, 



" ' Still rale those minds on earth 
At whom sage Milton's wormwood words were hurled : 
" Truth like a bastard comes into the world 
Never without ill-fame to him who gives her birth " ? ' " 

In all the rhetorical armory of Mr. Hardy irony is 
the weapon most frequently and effectively used. 
In this volame examples are not far to seek, and 
they vary from what is unrelieved tragedy to what 
is merely pathos tinged with melancholy. Our ex- 
ample shall he of the less poignant sort, taken from 
the poem on the Pyramid of Cestius. 

*' Who, then, was Cestius, 
And what is he to me ? — 
Amid thick thoughts and memories multitudinous 
One thought alone brings he. 

" I can recall no word 
Of anything he did ; 
For me he is a man who died and was interred 
To leave a pyramid. 

" Whose purpose was exprest 
Not with its first design, 
Xor till, far down in time, beside it found their rest 
Two countrymen of mine." 

Taken as a whole, this volume of Mr. Hardy's 
poems makes an important contrihution to our liter- 
ature. This is due to its thought rather than to its 
expression, to its weight rather than to its grace, 
for the author is weighty even when he essays the 
triolet and the villanelle. The dates attached to 
some of these poems indicate that the author has 
been writing verse for many years past, and that 
his new departure is in their publication, not in 
their composition. 

Mr. Henley is unmistakably endowed with the 
lyric gift, although he takes delight in ragged and 
robustious measures. His songs are more suggestive 
of the blare of trumpets than of the tinkling of 
lutes, yet they are nevertheless songs. Fancies 
are not for this singer, who is content with nothing 
less than a revelation of the very core of passion, 
as, for example, in this striking set of couplets : 

" Love, which is Lust, is the Lamp in the Tomb. 
Love, which is Lust, is the Call from the Gloom. 

" Love, which is Lust, is the Main of Desire. 
Love, which is Lust, is the Centric Fire. 

" So man and woman will keep their trust. 
Till the very Springs of the Sea run dust. 

"Yes, each with the other will lose and win, 
Till the very Sides of the Grave fall in. 

" For the strife of Love 's the abysmal strife, 
And the word of Love is the Word of Life. 

" And they that go with the Word unsaid, 
Though they seem of the living, are damned and dead." 

There is nothing of sentimental pallor in such verse 
as this, but rich color as of wine, and heat as of the 
orb of day. It is not often that Mr. Henley works 
in tints as neutral as those of the following lovely 
lines. 

" The downs, like uplands in Eden, 
Gleam in an afterglow 
Like a rose-world ruining earthwards — 
Mystical, wistful, slow ! 



" Near and afar in the leafage. 
That last glad call to the nest ! 
And the thought of you hangs and triumphs 
With Hesper low in the west ! 

" Till the song and the light and the colour. 
The passion of earth and sky. 
Are blent in a rapture of boding 
Of the death we should one day die." 

These two songs represent perhaps the extremes of 
the collection called " Hawthorn and Lavender," 
which is a real addition to the English lyric treas- 
ury. The " London Types " that follow are more 
like the racy earlier work of Mr. Henley. In the 
form of the Shakespearian sonnet they depict such 
figures as the bus driver, the hawker, and the sand- 
wich man. The barmaid is thus described : 

" Her head 's a work of art, and, if her eyes 

Be tired and ignorant, she has a waist ; 

Cheaply the Mode she shadows ; and she tries 

From penny novels to amend her taste ; 

And, having mopped the zinc for certain years. 
And faced the gas, she fades and disappears." 

Finally, Mr. Henley's volume gives us a group of 
"Epicedia," which includes his magnificent tribute 
" ReginsB Dilectissimse Victoriae," than which no 
nobler song was evoked by the death of the Queen. 

" Think, when she passed. 
Think what a pageant of immortal acts. 
Done in the unapproachable face 
Of time by the high, transcending human mind, 
Shone and acclaimed 

And triumphed in her advent ! Think of the ghosts, 
Think of the mighty ghosts : soldiers and priests^ 
Artists and captains of discovery, 
God's chosen. His adventurers up the heights 
Of thought and deed — how many of them that led 
The forlorn hopes of the World ! — 
Her peers and servants, made the air 
Of her death-chamber glorious ! Think how they thronged 
About her bed, and with what pride 
They took this sister-ghost 
Tenderly into the night ! " 

From this high level of superb imaginative utter- 
ance the whole long poem does not for a moment 
decline. Here is the voice of a laureate by divine 
right, needing no official distinction for its recog- 
nition. As Browning said, " Why crown whom 
Zeus hath crowned in soul before ? " Among these 
commemorative pieces, the sonnet dedicated to the 
memory of Thomas Edward Brown, is so truthful 
a portrait as well as so beautiful a poem that it 
must be reproduced. 

" He looked half-parson and half-skipper : a quaint, 
Beautiful blend, with blue eyes good to see. 
And old-world whiskers. You found him cynic, saint. 
Salt, humourist, Christian, poet ; with a free. 
Far-glancing, luminous utterance ; and a heart 
Large as St. Francis's : withal a brain 
Stored with experience, letters, fancy, art, 
And scored with runes of human joy and pain. 
Till six-and-sixty years he used his gift. 
His gift unparalleled, of laughter and tears. 
And left the world a high-piled, golden drift 
Of verse : to grow more golden with the years, 
Till the Great Silence fallen upon his ways 
Break into Song, and he that had Love have Praise." 

The volume that offers all these things, and many 
more of equal beauty, is a gift indeed.

To bend the bow of Ulysses, to take up once 
more the most pathettc and human of Greek tales, 
to restore the figure that Homer clothed with 
thought and wisdom, that Dante and Tennyson in- 
vested with new attributes of spiritual mystery — 
this has been the latest task of Mr. Stephen Phillips, 
and it falls fairly within the reach of his powers. 
Not an original poet, he has shown himself to be an 
imitative poet of remarkable parts, and particularly, 
both in his « Herod " and his " Paolo and Fran- 
cesca," he has exhibited the capacity for reviving 
and fashioning in modern guise the old-world 
story about which the emotion of centuries has 
gradually collected. For a poet of his talent the 
selection of a subject is half the battle, and he has 
been as happy in his selection of the Ithacan wan- 
derer as he was in his selection of the lovers of 
Rimini. " Ulysses " is a drama in a prologue and 
three acts. It is not Homer alone that the drama 
recalls, for Mr. Phillips is eclectic in his method, 
and no little of his inspiration in the present case 
has come from Germanic sources. The prologue 
is an echo of the " Prolog im Himmel " of " Faust," 
and in the first act — the parting from Calypso — 
there is not a little of the feeling of Tannhauser in 
the Venusberg. The prologue is a distinctly un- 
fortunate invention or imitation. The deep irony 
of Goethe's pantheon is missing, and we have instead 
such lumbering humor as the defence of Zeus, when 
twitted with his own escapades for the purposes of 
arousing his sympathies in behalf of the hero held 
captive in Ogygia. 

" 'Tia time that earthly women had their share 
In this large bosom's universal care. 
That Danae, Leda, Leto, all had place 
In my most broad beneficent embrace : 
True that we gods who on Olympus dwell 
With mortal passion sympathize too well." 

We are glad to get past this luckless attempt at the 
serio-comic, and into the entirely serious tale of the 
hero. What is probably the finest passage of the 
poem is the outburst of Ulysses when he declares 
himself to Calypso. 

"Then have the truth ; I speak as a man speaks ; 
Pour out my heart like treasure at your feet. 
This odorous amorous isle of violets, 
That leans all leaves into the glassy deep. 
With brooding music over noontide moss. 
And low dirge of the lily-swinging bee,— 
Then stars like opening eyes on closing flowers, — 
Palls on my heart. Ah, God ! that I might see 
Gaunt Ithaca stand up out of the surge. 
Yon lashed and streaming rocks, and sobbing crags. 
The screaming gull and the wild-flying cloud : — 
To see far off the smoke of my own hearth, 
To smell far out the glebe of my own farms, 
To spring alive upon her precipices. 
And hurl the singing spear into the air ; 
To scoop the mountain torrent in my hand. 
And plunge into the midnight of her pines ; 
To look into the eyes of her who bore me. 
And clasp his knees who 'gat me in his joy, 
Prove if my son be like my dream of him. 

We two have played and tossed each other words ; 
Goddess and mortal we have met and kissed. 
Now am I mad for silence and for tears, 



For the earthly voice that breaks at earthly ills. 
The mortal hands that make and smooth the bed. 
I am an-hungered for that human breast, 
That bosom a sweet hive of memories — 
There, there to lay my head before I die, 
There, there to be, there only, there at last I " 

The second act is the descent into hell, and the 
third the return to Ithaca. This last act has all the 
familiar incidents of the swineherd, the nurse who 
recognizes her master by the boar's scar, the insolent 
mockery of the old man by the suitors, the sign of 
Athena, and the palace become a slaughter-house. 
This part of the story tells itself, and commands, as 
it has done for three thousand years, the rapt at- 
tention and the responsive tears of those to whom 
it is told. When the eyes grow dim as one pathetic 
incident after another is unfolded, it is to Homer 
that their tribute is paid rather than to Mr. Phillips, 
yet we would not be grudging of our admiration 
for the skill with which the English poet has made 
use of the material thus brought to his hand. He 
has made a poem that may be read (except for the 
prologue) with unalloyed satisfaction, and he has 
at the same time written a play that deserves to 
hold the stage, not merely as a dramatic curiosity, 
but as a permanent addition to the serious repertory 
of a regenerated English drama. 

Six collections of verse in thirteen years is the 
record of Mr. Arthur Symons. The sixth collection, 
entitled " The Loom of Dreams," added to a re- 
issue of all that the author cares to preserve out of 
the other five, is given us in the two volumes of 
" Poems " now published. The occasion is conse- 
quently fitting to say a few words concerning the 
entire poetical product of this talented writer, rather 
than merely to give an example of his latest work. 
Mr. Symons is clearly a poet who will have to be 
reckoned with in future estimates of the recent 
period, by virtue of the exquisite delicacy and sen- 
sibility of a portion of his work, rather than by 
virtue of any special message or inspiration that, 
may be gathered from his work as a whole. Con- 
sidered as a whole, indeed, that work is so alien to 
English ideals of beauty and of conduct that it must 
be regarded as a " sport " rather than as a natural 
blossoming of English speech. Its frank sensuality 
and its morbid eroticism are characteristics reflected 
from the French decadents — from Baudelaire and 
Verlaine — rather than illustrations of the noble 
spiritual tradition of Shelley and Wordsworth and 
Tennyson. Mr. Symons remains in successive vol- 
umes, and with consistent purpose, what Rossetti 
and Browning and Mr. Swinburne were at moments

in Rossetti on the score of his Italian blood and his 
marvellous artistry; we forgive it in Browning 
because it was coupled with robust intellectual vigor ; 
we forgive it in Mr. Swinburne because it was only 
a passing phase — a boyish fling — redeemed a hun- 
dred times over by the exaltation of the spirit which 
is Mr. Swinburne's most marked quality. But the

after year plays upon the strings of sense, and runs 
the whole gamut of carnal passion until, satiety 
being achieved, he can find no nobler refuge than 
a nauseating mixture of faint sensuality and relig- 
ious mysticism. As long as he can hold to it, the 
motto of his song seems to be that of these lines 
from "Liber Amoris" — lines that derive directly 
from Baudelaire : 

" What 's virtue, Bianca ? Have we not 

Agreed the word should be forgot. 

That ours be every dear device 

And all the subtleties of vice, 

And, in diverse imaginings. 

The savour of forbidden things," 

Our quotation must close abruptly with the comma, 
because what follows is unfit for decent print. But 
«ven this sort of thing is better than the mawkish 
religiosity of the mood that succeeds. 

" O Most High ! I will pray, look down through the seven 
Passionate veils of heaven, 
Out of eternal peace, where the world's desire 
Enfolds thee in veils of fire ; 
Holy of Holies, the immaculate Lamb, 
Behold me, the thing I am I 

I, the redeemed of thy blood, the bought with a price. 
The reward of thy sacrifice, 
I, who walk with thy saints in a robe of white, 
And who worship thee day and night. 
Behold me, the thing I am, and do thou beat back 
These feet that burn on my track." 

The feet are those of the dogs of sensual desire, 
but there is no real repentance in the prayer, only 
a subtler form of the self-indulgence that has 
brought this pitiful soul to so pitiful a pass. The 
unwholesome character of these poems by Mr. 
Symons has to be emphasized because their verbal 
magic is potent to charm even when they glorify 
what is most base in human nature. How pure 
and true a poet Mr. Symons can be at his best 
may be illustrated by these lovely verses written 
at Montserrat : 

" Peace waits among the hills ; 
I have drunk peace, 
Here, where the blue air fills 
The great cup of the hills. 
And fills with peace. 

" Between the earth and sky, 
I have seen the earth 
Like a dark cloud go by. 
And fade out of the sky ; 
There was no more earth. 

*' Here, where the Holy Graal 
Brought secret light 
Once, from beyond the veil, 
I, seeing no Holy Graal, 
See divine light. 

*' Light fills the hills with God, 
Wind with his breath. 
And here, in his abode, 
Light, wind, and air praise God, 
And this poor breath." 

One more lyric, representing the author's latest 
work, must be quoted. It is called " The Crying 
of Water." 

" O water, voice of my heart, crying in the sand, 
All night long crying with a mournful cry. 
As Ilie and listen, and cannot understand 



The voice of my heart in my side or the voice of the sea, 
water, crying for rest, is it I, is it I ? 
All night long the water is crying to me. 

" Unresting water, there shall never be rest 
Till the last moon droop and the last tide fail. 
And the fire of the end begin to burn in the west ; 
And the heart shall be weary and wonder and cry like the 

sea. 
All life long crying without avail. 
As the water all night long is crying to me." 

This seems to us one of the most beautiful things 
in English song ; its tender pathos is fairly matched 
by the subtle music of the verse, and the result is 
quite beyond criticism. A very slender sheaf of 
such verse as this would outweigh all the contents 
of these two substantial volumes. 

In the metrical freedom as well as in the natural 
imagery of the later work of Mr. Symons the at- 
tentive ear may cateh echoes, not alone of Verlaine 
and his fellows, but also of the neo-Celtic movement 
in English poetry. Let us set by the side of the 
poem last quoted this stanza by another writer: 

" O sands of my heart, what wind moans low along thy 

shadowy shore ? 
Is that the deep sea-heart I hear with the dying sob at its 

core? 
Each dim lost wave that lapses is like a closing door : 
'Tis closing doors they hear at last who soon shall hear no 

more. 
Who soon shall hear no more." 

The two poems might have been written by the 
same hand, yet the one just illustrated is the work, 
not of Mr. Arthur Symons, but of Miss " Fiona 
Macleod." We take it from a recent selection of 
her songs, containing pieces both old and new, and 
entitled " From the Hills of Dream." Having 
made the one extract for the purpose of indicating 
a parallelism of sentiment and artistic method, we 
we will make one more for the sake of its own 
sheer loveliness. 

" Dim face of Beauty haunting all the world. 
Fair face of Beauty all too fair to see. 
Where the lost stars adown the heavens are hurled, 

There, there alone for thee 

May white peace be. 

" For here where all the dreams of men are whirled 
Like sere torn leaves of autumn to and fro, 
There is no place for thee in all the world, 

Who drif test as a star. 

Beyond, afar. 

" Beauty, sad face of Beauty, Mystery, Wonder, 
What are these dreams to foolish babbling men — 
Who cry with little noises 'neath the thunders 

Of ages ground to sand. 

To a little sand." 

Simplicity of diction, subtlety of thought, and 
absolute sincerity are the qualities which give dis- 
tinction to the poetry of Mrs. Alice Meynell. She 
publishes little because she is too severe a censor 
of her own work to allow it to stream forth unre- 
strained. Her own artistic conscience must be sat- 
isfied, and then the reader may say what he will. 
Her " Later Poems " constitute a volume even more 
slender than the earlier " Poems " that won the 
applause of such critics as Ruskin, Rossetti, and

Patmore. They include nothing quite equal to 
" Renouncement " and one or two other pieces of 
the earlier collection, but it is also true that they 
contain nothing that we would willingly spare. 
We quote " A Dead Harvest," one of the most ex- 
quisite of them all. 

" Along the graceless grass of town 

They rake the rows of red and brown, 

Dead leaves, unlike the rows of hay, 

Delicate, neither gold nor grey, 

Baked long ago and far away. 

" A narrow silence in the park ; 
Between the lights a narrow dark. 
One street rolls on the north, and one, 
Ma£B.ed, upon the south doth run. 
Amid the mist the work is done. 

" A futile crop ; for it the fire 
Smoulders, and, for a stack, a pyre. 
So go the town's lives on the breeze, 
Even as the sheddings of the trees ; 
Bosom nor barn is filled with these." 

There are less than a score of pieces altogether, but 
they are of precious metal, almost without alloy. 

Mrs. Meynell has spent the past winter in Cali- 
fornia, and has doubtless learned, among other 
things surprising to an Englishwoman, that the 
Pacific Coast has a stimulating intellectual atmos- 
phere as well as a tonic physical climate. The 
number of far Western books that compel attention 
is rapidly increasing from year to year, and pres- 
ages a possible future in which the region which the 
late Charles Dudley Warner called "our Italy" 
may charm us by art as it now charms us by nature. 
The volume of " Poems " by Miss Irenfe Hardy has 
much of the characteristic Western breeziness and 
originality so attractive to the jaded senses of the 
older civilizations, yet it ofEers work which is by no 
means lawless in form, and which maintains the 
tradition of good English verse. We might em- 
phasize its local coloring by a series of extracts, 
but prefer, on the whole, to find our illustrative 
example in a piece which savors of no time or 
place. It is a sonnet on the sonnet, which is a 
peculiarly difficult thing to write well enough to 
arouse more than a languid interest. Miss Hardy 
has done this difficult thing, as these lines attest : 

" The sonnet is the violet of song, 
A flower that springs responsive to the rain 
Of tears, or to the heart when under strain 

Of joy so deep that silence would do wrong 

To life and love ; then lyric phrases throng 
The thought, intoning, rise and fall, — again, 
Again, — like evening bells in low refrain, 

As if the words the passion would prolong. 

O thou that seekest to make this little flower 
Bloom in thy garden-plot of poesy, 
Behold how dear it was to laureate Kings 

And plant thou, too, in sacred earth and bower ; 
And men shall love thee in the years to be 
As one who loved and cherished loveliest things." 

The "Ode for Forefathers' Day" which closes 
Miss Hardy's volume is peculiarly interesting as 
the tribute of a Western writer to the idealism 
upon which our nation was founded. It is also a 
noble poem, from which we gladly quote. 



" As Homer saw the Prospect Wide, nor knew 
The bounds by Nature set, nor dreamed nor thought to 
dream 
How great man's mind should one day make it seem. 
The Pilgrim Heroes, from their mount of vision, drew. 
With eye of faith a far perspective, true 
To God-given promise, yet to them too dim 
For all surmise, except obedience to Him. 
In a land they did not know, transplanted side by side. 
Their love and hope and faith, these three, till now abide." 

Another book of verse from the same far Western 
country is called " California Violets," and is the 
work of Miss Grace Hibbard. The title is aptly 
chosen, for modesty and dewy freshness are proper 
words to describe these unpretending lyrics. " A 
White Chrysanthemum " is a typical example. 

" Last night beside my hearthstone 
She sat in snowy dress ; 
The firelight touched her golden hair 
With many a fond caress. 

"She wore white autumn flowers. 
Like frozen stars they seemed ; 
One flower she left, else I should think 
Of angels I had dreamed." 

Some verses on "The Man without the Hoe" are 
worth mentioning. 

'^ No flights of fancy are his, 

No flutterings up to the stars ; 
No beating of feeble hands 
Upon Fate's unyielding bars. 

"Sing not of chains unto him. 

To the man who holds the hoe, 
For mighty 's his brawny arm. 
And powerful to o'erthrow. 

"But pity, your pity, I crave. 
For the man without the hoe. 
Slender fingers, blue-veined brow, 
Oh, many such one you know." 

" The Arcadian Library " is a new series of 
small volumes of verse, and " The Watchers of the 
Hearth," by Mr. Benjamin Sledd, is the first volume. 
Mr. Sledd's verses are of the gentle contemplative 
sort, marked by an instinctive refinement, breath- 
ing a tempered melancholy and a delicate pathos. 
"The Wraith of Roanoke " is a good example. 

" Like a mist of the sea at morn it comes. 
Gliding among the fisher-homes, — 
The vision of a woman fair ; 
And every eye beholds her there 

Above the topmost dune, 
With fluttering robe and streaming hair. 
Seaward gazing in dumb despair, 
Like one who begs of the waves a boon. 

" Lone ghost, of the daring few who came 
And, passing, left but a tree-carved name 

And the mystery of Groatan : 
And out of our country's dawning years 
I hear the weeping of woman's tears : 
With a woman's eyes I dimly scan 
Day after day the far blue verge. 
And pray of the loud unpitying surge. 
And every wind of heaven, to urge 
The sails that alone can succor her fate, — 
The wigwam dark and the savage mate. 
The love more cruel than crudest hate, — 
Still burns on her cheek that fierce hot breath, — 
And the shame too bitter to hide in death." 
The following exquisite descriptive bit must be 
added before taking leave of Mr. Sledd :

"Over the summer lands, 

The blossoming clouds float by, — 
Pure lilies flung from angel hands 

On the broad blue deep of the sky ; 
Or caught on the mountain strands 
In restless heaps they lie." 

" The Soul-at-Arms and Other Poems," by Mr. 
James Robinson Smith, is a volume not unlike the 
preceding one in sentiment and refinement, although 
perhaps dealing with a more abstract order of 
ideas. But, however philosophical the burden of 
these verses, there is nearly always something to 
bring them into direct touch with concrete human 
life. This touch is more evident than usual in the 
following sonnet, with its impressive ethical lesson : 
" The streets were angry on that starless night 
With people hungry for their daily bread. 
I stood confounded, till, above my head, 
A pale-lit window drew me to its height. 
A man was bending near a candle-light, 
And when I asked him what he did, he said, 
' Beside my wish for eating and my bed, 
I make me learn a little English right.' 
The crowd stood cursing its inhuman fate. 
Or sat contented in its misery, 
While he, as poor as they and starving, late 
And early steers his chosen destiny. 
We are what we set out for, and the great 
And blest of old are with us as we try." 

The sonnet and the quatrain are Mr. Smith's favor- 
ite forms, and the latter deserves illustration no less 
than the former. 

" His better words are lonely as his ways. 
Though human friendship is his great desire. 
He dreams of olive peace through precious days, 
But finds contentment in consuming fire." 

Mr. Robert Bridges is known to a wide circle of 
readers as the pungent commentator upon books 
and manners who enlivens the pages of " Life." 
That he can turn a neat bit of verse is also fairly 
well known, although the extent of his versifying, 
as revealed by his newly-published "Bramble 
Brae," may prove to some a surprise. He courts 
the occasional, personal, or bookish muse, for the 
most part, although he sometimes resorts to the 
more general inspirations of natural beauty and 
the tender sentiment of the common human rela- 
tions. His highest strain is reached in such a poem 
as '< A Toast to Our Native Land." 
" Huge yet alert, irascible yet strong. 
We make our fitful way 'mid right and wrong. 
One time we pour out millions to be free, 
Then rashly sweep an empire from the sea ! 
One time we strike the shackles from the slaves, 
And then, quiescent, we are ruled by knaves. 
Often we rudely break restraining bars, 
And confidently reach out toward the stars. 

"Yet under all these flows a hidden stream 
Sprung from the Rock of Freedom, the great dream 
Of Washington and Franklin, men of old 
Who knew that freedom is not bought with gold. 
This is the Land we love, our heritage. 
Strange mixture of the gross and fine, yet sage 
And full of promise — destined to be great. 
Drink to our Native Land 1 God Bless the State ! " 

We have often thought (and said) that some of the 
best of literary criticism is written in verse, and cer- 



tain of the pieces by Mr. Bridges "Written in Books " 
would serve well to illustrate the proposition. 
" Here is a forest tangle — 
Rank weeds, luxuriant ferns, and giant trees, 

All in a hoarse-voiced wrangle. 
With creaking branches swaying in the breeze. 

But if you care to listen. 
Above the noise you'll hear the piping of a bird. 

Gay feathers in the tree-tops glisten. 
And over all the sweetest music ever heard." 

One does not have to think long before realizing 
that this is a description of Mr. George Meredith's 
poetry. We will leave our readers to guess which 
particular sensational novelist of the day is de- 
scribed in the following couplet : 

"He sits in a sea-green grotto with a bucket of lurid paint, 
And draws the Thing as it isn't for the God of Things as 
they ain't!" 

Mr. John Vance Cheney has a subtle lyrical 
gift, although we have sometimes thought that he 
exercised it too frequently or on too slight occa- 
sion. We do not have this thought in turning over 
the volume which he quite simply calls " Lyrics," 
for this volume is a selection from the best material 
of its predecessors, supplemented by a few poems 
now published for the first time. Being a selection 
only from a much larger mass of material, this vol- 
ume has a high average quality, and should notably 
enhance Mr. Cheney's reputation. The nature- 
lyric is the species of composition which he most 
affects, and here is one of half a hundred examples. 
" Mute the ferny woodland ways, 

Hushed the merry meadow-lays ; 

Stillness all and heavy haze 

Of the charmed August days. 

In the hollow, on the steep. 

Dwells a silence long and deep ; 

Not the smallest whisper, now. 

Of the secrets of the bough ; 

In his glory hid, alone. 

Sits the hill god on his throne." 

" No great thing," the reader may say, and the reply 
must be, " Certainly not " — yet there is an elusive 
music in the lines that makes them seem very 
charming. With what gravity and justice of view 
Mr. Cheney can handle a more serious theme may be 
well illustrated by his lines on the death of the Queen. 
"Answer the cabin and the hunting-shed 

The voice of mourning in the royal halls ; 

The shadow crawls upon the crowned head. 

From out her palsied hand the sceptre falls. 

So. Wrap her in the banner from her walls ; 

The word of sorrow, why should it be said ? 

Hark 1 up and down the earth gray honor calls, 

And the long glories gather round her bed. 

Through all the years her people have been fed, 

Yea, the wild ox has fatted in her stalls ; 

To islands of the sea her lines have spread. 

Proud sons of song have sung her madrigals. 

Come, robe her not in white, and stand and weep ; 

Wrap round the banner-fold, and let her sleep," 

It is interesting to place this tribute to the august 
shade of Victoria beside the tribute, more impas- 
sioned, but not more sincere, quoted from one of the 
Queen's own subjects in an earlier section of this 
review. William Morton Payne.

The death, on February 6, 1900, of 
^r^hutorian of gj^ William Wilson Hunter, deprived 

BrUuh India. r> t ^ e <• i ^ •■, i r 

JbLingland of one of those builders of 
colonial empire to vrhose energies the nation owes 
much of her present greatness. Hunter's life, as 
portrayed by Mr. F. H. Skrine, exhibits a man 
of superior ability, with high purposes not unmixed 
with great personal ambition, gifted as a writer 
and rarely qualified as an organizer. His career 
may be divided logically into three distinct epochs. 
Born in 1840, in Scotland, equipped with a satis- 
factory education, he had to carve out his own 
fortune, and with characteristic energy he sought 
and won in open competition a modest place in 
the civil service of India. From 1862 to 1887 
he remained with the Indian government, advanc- 
ing step by step from a minor position to that of 
chief of the department of statistics and publication. 
His genius lay in the direction of literary presen- 
tation, and to his pen, more than to that of any 
other, Englishmen are indebted for a knowledge 
and appreciation of the vital conditions of Indian 
government. His monumental work, " The Impe- 
rial Gazeteer of India," furnished a fund of infor- 
mation unsurpassed in its time as an example of 
useful statistical compilation. This was, however, 
but one of his many activities; for not only was he 
an efl&cient worker in ordinary departmental admin- 
istration, but he was constantly occupied in histor- 
ical studies of Indian states and peoples, in the pub- 
lication of books resulting from these studies, in the 
weekly production of leading articles for at least 
two papers in India, and in correspondence with 
London journals. His articles for the press are 
numberless, while of printed works some twenty 
complete volumes of descriptive writing and thirty- 
eight volumes of statistics testify to the intensive 
energy of the man. In 1883 Hunter returned to 
England, and immediately became an authority at 
home upon Indian questions, filling the position of 
an expert in this field for " The Times." Besides 
many biographies and histories written or edited 
in this last period, he had entered upon the prepa- 
ration of a history of British India, of which the 
first volume was printed two years ago, and he was 
at work upon the second at the time of his death. 
Judging from the first volume, it is not too much 
to say that had he been permitted to complete the 
" British India " he would have ranked as one of 
the great historians of modern times, not perhaps 
in the way of detailed scientific examination, but in 
the power to grasp great causes and great move- 
ments, and in the ability to portray them in attrac- 
tive form. Mr. Skrine's biography of Hunter is 
not impartial, and it is not scientific. The author 
was in a certain way a protigS of Hunter's, and is 
not free to adopt a critical attitude. Hunter, like 
other strong men, made many enemies and aroused 
much criticism ; yet this does not appear in the 
present volume. He was of sufficient importance 



to have merited an accurate historical biography, 
one that would have presented both sides of con- 
troverted questions. Nevertheless, the volume as it 
stands is wholly readable; and the author has at least 
done well in leaving much of his narrative to per- 
sonal letters. These couched in Hunter's own attrac- 
tive style are charming and valuable. ( Longmans.) 

A prophecy of the future of Italy 
■^/S ^""'^^ ^^8®^ "P<*° ^^® introductory chapter* 
"•^ ""* of "Italy To-Day" (Scribner), the 

joint production of Mr. Bolton King and Mr. 
Thomas Okey, would be a very gloomy one. It 
would, indeed, be difficult to draw a more sombre 
picture than that presented of the disordered na- 
tional finances, the industrial distress, the weakness 
and irresolution of government, and in particular 
of the all pervading corruption in political circles. 
New York under Tweed was pure in comparison 
with the Italian government in its unblushing sale 
of important contracts and privileges. The utter 
lack of any principle of public honesty in govern- 
ment necessarily implies a national blindness to the 
enormity of the offense. In Italy, in truth, the 
student of history may easily discover in the cor- 
ruption of to-day the elements that once constituted 
the essentials of social and political conditions in 
many of the petty states in former centuries. 
United Italy is a modern product. The absorption 
of many governments in one, the assertion of mod- 
ern doctrines of political right, the adoption of the 
outward forms of a progressive state, are not the 
sole nor even the principal factors of strength and 
permanence. Italy is just realizing that formal 
unity in government is but the first step toward 
perfected nationality. Yet it is at least an evidence 
of progress that this fact is now fully grasped by 
the leaders in all domains of intellectual activity ; 
and in this the authors find the greatest hope for 
the future. In their view, the vital necessity of 
the moment is not so much the enactment of rem- 
edial social legislation as the adoption by political 
parties of some definite ideals. The monarchy, 
deprived of the popularity which was its strength 
in the first years of union, is no longer a force bind- 
ing Italy together. Parliamentary government, 
reinforced and purified by guiding principles, may 
still furnish the tie, but at present the Socialists 
are the only purists. Old ideals no longer exist, 
and, in the dearth of spiritual or uplifting causes, 
politics and corruption have become synonymous. 
National leaders are without honor and professedly 
without hope ; they must give place to newer men 
of higher purpose. The signs are not wanting that 
such a change is imminent. In spite, therefore, of 
the candid and instructive exposition and analysis 
of the evils existent in the outward manifestations 
of Italian life, as they shape themselves in politics 
and in social movements, the thesis is maintained 
with vigor " that underneath the slough of misgov- 
ernment and corruption and political apathy there 
is a rejuvenated nation, instinct with the qualities

that make a great people." Where so much evil 
exists, the struggle for betterment must needs be 
severe, and it may be violent ; but the future, it is 
asserted, is distinctly hopeful. In interest, clear- 
ness of treatment, and thoroughness of examination, 
the book is a valuable contribution to the study of 
Italian politics. 

Nature, art, ^ desire to cover too large a field is 
literature, and apparent in Mrs. Ellen Russell Em- 
other matters. Q^^on^B "Nature and Human Na- 
ture " (Houghton). Literature, language, and art, 
including music, also come in for discussion. In 
her treatment of art, and symbolism in art, the 
author shows herself most at home, despite an occa- 
sional fanciful idea or far-fetched analogy. Her 
interpretation of the LaocoOn as suggesting, in the 
serpents' undulating folds, " the gliding stanchless 
waves of the sea, against whose onward movement 
there is no barrier," is new to us. Were Poseidon 
the offended divinity in the case, this reading of 
the symbol would be more plausible. But the temp- 
tation to subtilize on art, as Lessing says in his 
"Laokoon," sometimes leads one into whimsical 
theories. As an interpreter of nature, Mrs. Emer- 
son is helpful. Passing to letters, she asserts that 
when a poet willingly becomes a translator of an- 
other's verse, he thereby stands confessed as a 
minor poet. Hence she refuses to recognize Long- 
fellow and Bryant as great poets. Leaving Pope 
out of the account, does she forget that Goethe and 
Schiller and Browning also tried their hand at 
translating ? Or would she deny greatness to them 
as well? Evidently not; for she afterwards speaks 
of Browning in the same breath with Shakespeare, 
ascribing to both the *' balance of heart and brain " 
that marks the true poet. The writer's thought, it 
must be said in conclusion, suffers for lack of terse- 
ness and incisiveness in its presentation. We 
choose, almost at random, a sentence that cries out 
for the pruning-knife, — "Interpretation of the 
sublimity of an uplift of rock, forest, and tableland 
is product of a vision dependent on the soul's sight, 
and sublimity is not more intrinsic to mountainous 
scenery than is color to a garden of flowers." The 
Gallicism in the following is so harsh, and so un- 
necessary, as to merit censure, — " Scientific discov- 
ery, indeed, has laid its axe to the root of many 
errors, and among which the error of self-impor- 
tance is not the least conspicuous." May linguistic 
discovery soon lay its axe to the root of this error 
of speech ! A number of new or little-used words, 
as "sculptuary" (i. q. sculpture), "bolide," "land- 
scapist," are encountered in Mrs. Emerson's pleas- 
ant pages. 

The title " The Jew as a Patriot " 
l'Sir;i. (Balder & Taylor Co.) fitly describes 

the little book which the Rev. Mr. 
Peters, a Baptist clergyman of New York, has 
packed full of statistics illustrating the leadership 
of men of Hebrew birth or lineage in the world's 
enterprises. His object is to furnish a thesis in 



reply to Mark Twain's magazine article, which 
presented the Jew as "charged with a patriotic 
disinclination to stand by the flag as a soldier," 
and as " by his make and his ways, substantially 
a foreigner wherever he may be." Mr. Clemens's 
subsequent apology was but partial, in saying as 
he did that when publishing his article he " was 
ignorant, like the rest of the Christian world, that 
the Jew had a record as a soldier." Mr. Peters's 
rapid summary of the patriotic record made by the 
Jews in the American Civil War merely states facts 
which were well known to those engaged in that war, 
and Mr. Clemens's confession of ignorance should 
not have attempted to screen itself behind what 
he imagined to be " the rest of the Christian world." 
But Mr. Peters shows, further, an equally credit- 
able record of Hebrew patriotism, military, civil, 
political, and financial, in the earlier wars of the 
American republic, and also in the history of sev- 
eral of the leading states of Continental Europe. 
So far from being singled out for reproach in any 
respect, the Jew is entitled to especial credit for 
not suffering his patriotism to be in any degree 
weakened by the cosmopolitan character which the 
accidents of history have imposed upon his race. 
His universal patriotism, local wherever the Jew 
himself becomes locally domiciled, entitles him to 
the high encomium of a true " citizen of the world "; 
and this characteristic has been well illustrated 
in Mr. Peters's monograph. In his zeal for his 
chosen clients, our author goes further, and in a 
concluding chapter expounds generally the indebt- 
edness of the world to the Jewish race. In one 
chapter, occupying nine pages, personal examples 
of their preeminence in poetry and the drama, in 
music, art, and science, in law, history, and criti- 
cism, are furnished in profusion. " No man," he 
says, " needs to apologize for belonging to a race 
which has produced such poets." And on the sub- 
ject of the Hebrews as money-makers, his statistics 
show that they are, in the great mass, people in poor 
and humble circumstances, and that the great capi- 
talists among them are but few. America, whose 
fair and impartial treatment of her Hebrew citizens 
has done much to atone for the slights put upon 
this proscribed race before the advent of the Great 
Republic, now adds generosity to her justice in the 
publication of this brief but earnest tribute to their 
great ability and patriotism.

M. Edwards of Oxford makes the first attempt to

Wales from ancient times down to the present day. 
A Welshman himself, he was able to make use of

the original documents for some of the more dis- 
puted portions of this long stretch of history. The 
first half of his hook sketches the rise and fall of 
the princely caste in a very condensed form. In 
fact, this part of the volume suffers from too great 
condensation. The reader labors continually under 
the disadvantage of not knowing enough of the 
great facts of the period which the writer too often 
takes for granted as familiar to him. The second 
part of the volume, sketching the rise of a self- 
educated and self-governing peasantry, does not 
present the same difficulty for the reader. It 
rounds up the history in a more completed form, 
and gives a more definite idea of the sequence of 
events and their relations the one to the other. 
Principal Rhys of Oxford has given us our best 
history of the period of the formation of the Welsh 
people, and Mr. Seebohm has expounded in detail 
their early social history. Consequently Mr. Ed- 
wards has passed lightly over these two themes. 
With the almost necessary condensation of the 
volume, it nevertheless gives us the best single- 
volume history of one of the hardiest and most 
substantial little peoples of the Old World.

of that perpetually unsettled problem in casuistry, 
whether or not falsehood is ever justifiable. Here 
a woman, eager for attention and praise, is wedded 
to a man miserly in his affections. A mighty 
traveller, who has won the plaudits of all Britain 
by his conduct during a ticklish time in Africa, 
returns to civilization and falls desperately in love 
with the half-neglected wife. She plays with fire 
long enough to be found in his company at a river- 
aide inn, about to dine with him. The discoverer, 
her brother-in-law, telegraphs the husband. Friends 
of hers arriving just after, the wife returns home, 
and one of the friends, the peacemaker of the 
book, dines with the lover instead. Then every- 
one unites to lie the wife out of her scrape, — some 
of them men of the utmost probity, who still find 
it impossible to disclose facts which may have so 
tragic an ending for so comic an episode. The 
plot is ingenious, the conversation is brilliant with- 
out being surcharged with impossible epigram, the 
final curtain is well contrived, and the play is suffi- 
ciently analytical and involved to make an intellec- 
tual appeal. Its popularity is sufficiently attested 
by the fact that it held the boards of the Criterion 
Theatre in London for a year or more in 1897-8, 
Mr. Charles Wyndham appearing as the " peace- 
maker " of the cast. Still, the work is not in Mr. 
Jones's best manner. It lacks those Bashes of sat- 
ire which so brilliantly exposed the weaknesses of 
the British middle classes, concerning itself only 
with the follies of the aristocracy. It points no 
moral higher than the inexpediency of being caught, 
or the expediency of treating one's wife with due 
consideration. But it is still a great advance on 



the dramatic work of a generation ago, and brings 
to the American a sharper realization of the un- 
fortunate condition of dramatic affairs in his own 

country. 

Euaysupon Professor Pasquale ViUari's "Two 

Florentine and First Centuries of Florentine His- 
itaiian hutory. j.^^^ » (Scribner) has become so well 
known since the appearance of the two-volume 
edition in 1895, that an extended review of the 
work in its new single-volume form is not necessary. 
The present issue of the book hardly attains to the 
dignity of a second edition. The chronicle of the 
pseudo Brunetto Latini has been omitted ; other- 
wise there is no change in the text. Page for 
page, word for word, the matter is the same, even as 
simple a slip as that on page 158, where the name 
of Frederick I. has crept into the text, obviously in 
the place of Henry VI., is retained. So also the 
many offenses of the translator against ordinary 
English usage, — conspicuously on the title-page, — 
have been left untouched. It may be well to repeat, 
however, this much of what has been said before. 
The book is not a history of Florence, as the title 
might lead one to suppose. It is rather a collection 
of brilliant and valuable essays upon Florentine 
and Italian institutions that have appeared before 
in various Italian journals, — the dates of publica- 
tion ranging over a period of nearly thirty years. 
The author, however, has never taken the trouble 
to rewrite these articles in the light of the sub- 
sequent work of such investigators as Capponi, 
Hartwig, Scheffer Birchorst, and others. Other 
than an occasional foot-note, no use has been made 
of this new material. 

Fifth among the numbers of the 
First of modem „ Artist's Library " (Longmans), ed- 

landscape artists. , , , ,, -r ^ -r.. 

ited by Mr. Laurence Binyon, is 
Mr. C. J. Holmes's volume on Constable. As in 
the preceding volumes, a pleasantly written biog- 
raphy of the painter, drawn in this case from the 
inclusive work of Leslie, precedes an extended crit- 
ical survey of his work. It is unfortunate that Mr. 
Holmes should be obliged — compelled is perhaps 
the better word — to defend his painter from the 
attacks upon his art and method which Ruskin's 
enthusiasm for Turner caused him to make ; but it 
is a pious duty, and is well performed. The de- 
light with which Constable's work was received in 
France long before he had been accorded the praise 
his genius deserved in his own England might have 
warned Mr. Holmes against making too much of 
the state of painting in Great Britain at the time, 
and the cautious reader will receive his dicta on 
the superiority of British art with some allowances 
for patriotic fervor. But he is right in calling 
Constable the first of the moderns in landscape, 
and doubly right in bringing forward proofs of his 
real veneration and regard for his predecessors, 
however much he departed from them. The book 
concludes with twenty-four reproductions, in half- 
tone, of Constable's most characteristic work.

The life of 
a holy man 
of England, 



The life of <' Monsieur Vincent," by 
Mr. James Adderley, following the 
life of St. Francis by the same 
author in the " Lives of Holy Men " series (Long- 
mans), has less of vital interest than the earlier 
volume. A life given up in great measure to 
purely administrative details, however fruitful of 
good and however significant in the development 
of civilization, does not easily lend itself to the 
purposes of the story-teller. In the opening chap- 
ter, Mr. Adderley says : " We admire the capacity 
and wonder at the genius of men who are able to 
conceive and carry out just one piece of work in a 
lifetime ; John Howard, the reformer of prisons ; 
John Wesley, the popularizer of the Gospel ; Lord 
Shaftesbury, the friend of the over-worked women 
and children ; Dr. Pusey, the reviver of the belief 
in Church and Sacraments. What are we to think 
of a single man who combined the work of all 
these and more besides?" What St. Vincent ac- 
complished in these various directions is told 
simply, with some little incidental comparison of 
his methods with the methods of social and relig- 
ious reformers of our time, and not always to the 
credit of the latter. If Mr. Adderley errs as a 
biographer, it is in his uncritical attitude toward 
his hero, an attitude perhaps made necessary by the 
narrow limits imposed upon him in compressing so 
much into so small a book. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The new edition of " Studies of the Greek Poets," by 
John Addington Symonds, is reprinted unchanged, and 
means nothing more than that the earlier impression 
had become exhausted. We are glad that the demand 
for this sterling work requires a new edition every few 
years, for it is the best book of its kind in the language, 
and has done incalculable service to students of litera- 
ture in revealing to them the ethical and aesthetic aspects 
of Greek poetry. It does not say the final word of 
scholarship upon the subject, but it does have the rare 
power of arousing interest and enthusiasm. There are 
two volumes, imported by the Messrs. Macmillan. 

Three new Baedekers have just been imported by 
Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. The <« Egypt " is a 
remodeled edition, bringing into a single volume the 
greater part of the matter which has hitherto filled the 
two devoted to " Upper Egypt " and " Lower Egypt." 
The text has been curtailed about one-third, and 
brought down to date. Khartoum again takes its 
place among the towns to be visited, and may be 
reached by a train de luxe on the Soudan Military Rail- 
way, The " Great Britain " is the fifth edition of the 
work first published about twelve years ago, and has 
been revised by Mr. J. F. Muirhead, the original author. 
A separate " Scotland " is promised at no distant date. 
The " Southern Germany," comprising Wiirtenherg and 
Bavaria, is now separated from its former association 
with Austria, and becomes itself a volume of respect- 
able dimensions. These manuals need no recommenda- 
tion. They are, as they always have been, quite hors 
concours, incomparably the best ever prepared for the 
convenience of the traveller. 



Notes. 



" Henry Esmond," in two volumes, has just been 
added to the Dent-Macmillan edition of Thackeray. 

"The Self-Educator in English Composition," by 
Mr. G. H. Thornton, is published by Messrs. Thomas Y. 
Crowell & Co. 

Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. have in press for im- 
mediate publication the authorized edition of Count 
Tolstoi's new book, '« What Is Religion ? " 

Mr. W. R. Jenkins sends us, in the series of "Contes 
Choisis," a volume by M. Francois Copp^e, entitled 
" Le Morceau de Pain et Autres Contes," edited by Mr. 
G. Castegnier. 

Mr. Harlan Hoge Ballard is the latest of our Vir- 
gilian translators, and his version of the first half of 
the " ^neid," in English hexameters, is now published 
by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 

Mr. M. Oppenheim's new edition of " The Spanish 
Conquest in America " by Sir Arthur Helps, has 
reached the second of its four projected volumes. The 
work is published by Mr. John Lane. 

" The Letters of Hugh, Earl Percy, from Boston 
and New York, 1774 — 1776," edited and annotated 
by Mr. Charles Knowles Bolton, will be issued this 
month in a limited edition by Mr. Charles E. Good- 
speed, Boston. 

Mr. William S. Lord of Evanston, Illinois, has in 
press for early issue a volume of poems by Mr. John 
McGovern, a selection of "Love-Story Masterpieces" 
chosen by Mr. Ralph A. Lyon, and a book of " Line o' 
Type Lyrics" by Mr. Bert Leston Taylor. 

A new edition, revised and supplemented by much 
new matter, of " The Book Lover," by Mr. James 
Baldwin, is published in charming form by Messrs. 
A. C. McClurg & Co., attesting the continued and 
deserved popularity of that helpful little work. 

A second series of " Pen Pictures from Ruskin," 
selected and arranged by Miss Caroline A. Wurtzburg, 
is added to the charming little " Pens^es Series," pub- 
lished in this country by Messrs. Longmans, Green, & 
Co. " Places, nature studies, and things in general," 
are dealt with in the present selection. 

Three new " Temple Classics " (the first to reach 
our table for some time) have just been sent us by the 
Macmillan Co. They include a new translation, made 
by Mr. W. V. Cooper, of Boethius's " The Consolation 
of Philosophy "; Bunyan's " The Holy War," edited by 
Mr. W. H. D. Rouse ; and the Plays of Goldsmith, 
annotated by Mr. Austin Dobson. 

Four new volumes of the " Temple Bible " are sent 
us by the J. B. Lippincott Co. They are as follows : 
" Isaiah," edited by the late A. B. Davidson ; " Ezra, 
Nehemiah, and Esther," edited by Dr. J. Wilson 
Harper ; " The Johannine Books," edited by the Rev. 
Canon Benham ; and " Hebrews, Peter, James, and 
Jude," edited by Dr. J. Herkless. 

An excellent text-book of " Modern Chemistry with 
Its Practical Applications," by Mr. Fredus N. Peters, is 
published by Messrs. Maynard, Merrill & Co. It is a 
handsomely-printed book, with its contents well- 
arranged, and, while essentially descriptive in its method, 
pays due attention to the laboratory aspect of the 
science. A novel feature, which we note with interest, 
is a glossary of alchemistic terms for the use of students 
who venture upon a course of reading in the history of 
chemistry. We should hardly have known where to

look, for example, if we had wanted to know what 
draco mitigatus was, or pulvis angelicus. Here we may 
learn that they were, respectively, mercurous chloride 
and antimony oxychloride. 

The eightieth birthday of our '« grand old man " of 
American letters, the Rev. Edward Everett Hale, has 
been signalized by the Outlook Co. by their publi- 
cation of a " birthday edition " of " The Man without 
a Country." Thick paper and generous margins make 
a volume of reasonable dimensions, which has a full- 
length portrait of the venerable author of this famous 
tale. 

Messrs. Tennant & Ward, New York, publish an ex- 
quisite edition of " The Lady Poverty," translated and 
edited by Mr. Montgomery Carmichael. This thir- 
teenth century allegory, called the " Sacrum Commer- 
cium," tells of St. Francis and how he wooed his 
chosen bride. It is the work of a Franciscan monk, 
possibly Giovanni da Parma, although the present 
editor rejects that ascription. This is the first English 
translation of the book. 

The " thin paper edition " of reprints, published by 
Mr. George Newnes, and imported into America by 
the Messrs. Scribner, is extended by five new volumes, 
three of which are a set of Shakespeare according to 
the traditional threefold classification. The fourth is 
*' The Poems and Songs of Robert Burns," and the fifth 
is Motteux's translation of " Don Quixote." The vol- 
umes are easily pocketable, although they average not 
far from a thousand pages each. 

Five volumes of modern language texts come to 
us from the American Book Co., as follows : " Das 
Spielmannskind " and "Der Stumme Ratsherr," by 
W. A. Riehl, edited by Mr. George M. Priest ; " Der 
Prozess " and " Einer Muss Heirater," by R. Benedix, 
edited by Mr. M. B. Lambert ; " Der Bibliothekar," 
by Gustav von Moser, edited by Mr. William A. 
Cooper ; an abridgment of Daudet's " Tartarin de Tar- 
ascon," edited by Mr. C. Fontaine ; and a volume of 
selected stories from Daudet, edited by Mr. T. Atkinson 
Jenkins. 

The second volume of the " Florilegium Latinum," 
edited by Mr. Francis St. John Thackeray and Mr. 
Edward Daniel Stone, and published by Mr. John 
Lane, is devoted to the Victorian poets. The Latin 
translations are set opposite the English originals, and 
are the work of upwards of forty scholars, among 
whom the editors of the volume occupy a conspicuous 
place. Tennyson has been the chief victim of these 
classical assaults, with Arnold for a good second. The 
translations include numerous examples of American 
poets, including Longfellow, Bryant, Emerson, Whit- 
tier, Lowell, Holmes, Sill, Saxe, Mr. Bret Harte, and 
Mr. John Hay.

A Summer Trip not 
Surpassed on the Continent. 

The trip to Salt Lake City, or to the Pacific coast 
via that point over the Denver & Rio Grande and 
the Rio Grande Western is the most beautiful in 
America. No European trip of equal length can 
compare with it in grandeur of scenery or wealth 
of novel interest. Then Salt Lake City itself is 
a most quaint and picturesque place and well 
worth the journey. Its Mormon temple, taber- 
nacle, tithing oflBce and church institutions; its 
hot sulphur springs within the city limits; its 
delightful temperature, sunny climate and its 
Great Salt Lake — deader and denser than the 
Dead Sea in Palestine — are but a few features 
of Salt Lake City's countless attractions. There 
are parks, drives, canons and beautiful outlying 
mountain and lake resorts. Imagine, if you can, 
a bath in salt water a mile above sea level and 
in water in which the human body cannot sink. 
Inquire of your nearest ticket agent for low 
tourist rates to Salt Lake City, or write for 
information and copy of " Salt Lake City, the 
City of the Saints," to S. K. Hooper, general 
passenger agent, Denver, Colo.

INDIA'S LOVE LYRICS 

Collected and Arranged by LAURENCE HOPE 

The London Aihenwum, in its review of the volume, written by 
one who must be himself a true poet, writes : 

" Mr. Hope brings to his task considerable command over various 
rhythms and a delicate gift of melody and sensuous beauty. His 
garden signifies the tremulous 

IRRECOVERABLB DELICIOUSNESS OF YOUNG PASSION. 
Mr. Hope has caught admirably the dominant notes of this Indian 
love poetry, its delirious absorption in the instant, its out-of-door 
air, its melancholy. Slender brown limbs stir silently in the garden, 

WHERE FLYING FOXES CROSS THE MOON, 
In the hot, jasmine-scented jungle among the pink almond blos- 
soms of Kandahar. And always there is the poignant sense of the 
fleetness of love — a moment's salvage from the flux of time."

A, NEW AND UNUSUALLY IMPORTANT NOVEL 

By GEORGE W. CABLE 

Ready Wednesday, May 21 

BYLOW HILL 

IN the midst of a quiet New England town Mr. Cable has set a 
story which might have engaged the sombre power of Hawthorne. 
In telling it, however, he has used the humor and charm of his best 
work as well as this intensity; so that the result, especially as the 
tragedy is confined to the mind, is one of more than a single motive, 
and holds the reader by more than one interest.

BRE T HA RTE. 

It was nearly a quarter of a century ago 
that Bret Harte, then close upon forty years 
of age, received an appointment in the consular 
service of the United States, and went abroad 
to live. He probably had little thought at the 
time that his self-expatriation would be pro- 
longed for twenty-four years, and that he would 
die in a foreign country. His first public ser- 
vice was at Crefeld, but after two years he was 



transferred to the important consulate at Glas- 
gow, where he remained until 1886, when the 
spoilsmen demanded his place, and he became 
a victim of our grotesque national system of 
consular appointments. He found life in Great 
Britain so comfortable that he decided to re- 
main. His reputation as a man of letters was 
so great that his pen assured him an income 
for as long as he should be able to use it ; he 
was, moreover, one of the few American writers 
of his time who were as popular in England as 
at home. He even had a following upon the 
Continent, especially in Germany, and his 
stories had been translated into many languages. 
So he removed from Glasgow to London, made 
himself a home ia the capital city of our race, 
and enjoyed life for something over twenty 
years longer. When he died, on the fifth of 
this month, he was in his sixty-third year. 

Bret Harte's reputation as a writer was fully 
made when he went abroad in the seventies, 
and it was curiously like the more recent repu- 
tation of Mr. Rudyard Kipling. In other 
words, it was based upon a mastery of the short 
story, upon a gift of vivid realism in the por- 
trayal of striking types of character found far 
from the conventional environment of old so- 
cieties, and upon a knack of easy rhyming of 
a sort now humorous, now pathetic, which occa- 
sionally stirred the deeper emotions. The 
things which he could do he had already done, 
and done inimitably, when he became a volun- 
tary exile. Since then, he has perhaps doubled 
the volume of his work, but he has added to 
it no new note, and has remained content to 
ring the changes upon the old themes and 
situations. 

It is perhaps the best of all legitimate trib- 
utes to his great talent, amounting almost to 
genius, to say that his later stories retain much 
of the freshness of the earlier ones. The vein 
of Californian romance which he worked so 
successfully in the seventies, continued in the 
nineties and beyond to yield ore of rich quality. 
He repeats himself many times, to be sure, but 
his repetitions are something more than replicas 
of achieved masterpieces ; they are rather anal- 
ogous to the variations upon a single theme to 
which the great composers have devoted their

best abilities. In the cases of the musician 
and the story-writer alike, the power to charm 
continuously is the real test, and we do not 
know why the variations of the artist in words 
should be treated with a scorn that we would 
not think of bestowing upon the variations of 
the artist in tones. 

Francis Bret Harte was born in Albany in 
1839. His father died when the boy was fifteen 
years old, and the family then migrated to 
California. The boy's early experience in- 
cluded gold-digging, type-setting, and school- 
teaching. When a compositor at Eureka he 
tried his hand at writing, and the ability thus 
displayed earned him an editorial position on 
his newspaper. But his zeal outran his dis- 
cretion, and the office was nearly wrecked in 
consequence of the young editor's denunciation 
of an outrageous Indian massacre in which the 
leading citizens of the town had taken part. 
He then started " The Californian " on his 
own account, but the paper had only a brief 
existence, and is chiefly remembered because 
the " Condensed Novels " first appeared in its 
columns. In 1868 " The Overland Monthly " 
was established, and Harte was appointed its 
editor. His opportunity was now at hand, and 
he knew how to make use of it. The story of 
his sudden leap into national fame with '' The 
Luck of Roaring Camp " is familiar, and 
need not be here repeated. The reception 
given it in California was decidedly unfavor- 
able, and many were the denunciations of 
the author that appeared in the press. But 
the East was yet to be heard from ; and when 
its voice was heard, the local verdict was ab- 
solutely reversed, for the story was received 
" with an enthusiasm that half frightened the 
author," and even "The Atlantic Monthly" 
wrote soliciting a contribution of similar 
sort. 

Two or three years later, Bret Harte left 
California for the East, and established him- 
self as a journalist and man of letters in con- 
nection with the "Atlantic "and the New York 
" Evening Post." This is the story of his life 
up to the time of his consular appointment, and 
is all that need be here recounted. It was a 
fortunate happening for American literature 
that he should have passed the receptive years 
of his life upon the Pacific Coast. Our na- 
tional history has offered few such opportu- 
nities for a genial observer, and Bret Harte 
was the man for the occasion. The exodus of 
1849 was one of the most picturesque things 
in our annals, and resulted in a social con- 



dition that remains absolutely unique. The 
author's own words must here be quoted to 
help our understanding of the phase of Amer- 
ican civilization that he has placed permanently 
upon record. 

" He must beg the reader to bear in mind that this 
emigration was either across a continent almost unex- 
plored, or by the way of a long and dangerous voyage 
around Cape Horn, and that the promised land itself 
presented the singular spectacle of a patriarchal Latin 
race who had been left to themselves, forgotten by the 
world, for nearly three hundred years. The faith, 
courage, vigor, youth, and capacity for adventure neces- 
sary to this emigration produced a body of men as 
strongly distinctive as the companions of Jason. Unlike 
most pioneers, the majority were men of profession and 
education ; all were young, and all had staked their 
future in the enterprise. Critics who have taken large 
and exhaustive views of mankind and society from club 
windows in Pall Mall or the Fifth Avenue can only 
accept for granted the turbulent Chivalry that thronged 
the streets of San Francisco in the gala days of her 
youth, and must read the blazon of their deeds like 
the doubtful qnarterings of the shield of Amadis de 
Gaul." 

The total literary output of this brilliant and 
accomplished writer includes, besides the sub- 
stantial collection of his poems, upwards of 
forty volumes of fiction. Perhaps one-fourth 
of these volumes are single novels ; the others 
are collections of short stories. Bret Harte 
was less successful when working upon a large 
scale than when he confined himself to a few 
pages. The constructive art, which was almost 
faultless in his briefer efforts, seemed to fail 
him when he attempted the form of lengthy 
narrative, and the most extensive of all his 
fictions, the story of " Gabriel Conroy," is 
among the weakest. Of his longer stories, 
" The Crusade of the Excelsior " is probably 
the best. It is as the master of the short story 
that he will mainly live in the history of our 
literature, and he is bound to occupy a high 
position. His stories are very uneven in their 
excellence, as could hardly fail to be the case 
when it is considered that they must number 
in the neighborhood of two hundred ; but the 
best of them, the best fifty of them, let us say, 
constitute a body of work that must be ranked 
above nearly everything else of its class in our 
literature, excepting only as hors concours the 
work of Poe and Hawthorne. And we are 
inclined to think that, taking the word novelist 
in its broadest sense, and reviewing our Ameri- 
can novelists of the past third of a century, 
there is not one among them all who has made 
a more valuable and lasting contribution to 
our literature than that which we owe to Bret 
Harte.

PAUL LEI CEST ER FORD. 

The shocking tragedy which ended the life of 
Paul Leicester Ford on the eighth of this month 
dealt a serious hlow to hoth American literature and 
American historical scholarship. Born in 1865, he 
had lived among hooks all his life, and had done 
an amount of literary work that was prodigious for 
one 80 young. On the historical side, his work 
comprises editions of the works of Thomas Jeffer- 
son and John Dickinson, a valuable critical work 
upon " The New England Primer," biographies of 
Washington and Franklin, and many lesser labors 
in the field of our Colonial and Revolutionary his- 
tory. To the larger public, he is best known as 
the author of "The Honorable Peter Stirling" and 
" Janice Meredith," besides two or three novels of 
lighter character. The first of these novels, which 
is one of the strongest works of recent American 
fiction, had a curious history. It came unheralded, 
and attracted little attention. Bat as time went 
on, its readers told their friends about it, and the 
demand steadily increased until it became one of 
the best-selling books upon the market, and con- 
tinued to be largely purchased for several years. 
In other words, it showed that a good book may 
achieve popular success in strictly legitimate ways, 
and its history stands in striking contrast to the 
history of the average popular novel of the day. 
The art of the advertiser brought immediate suc- 
cess to "Janice Meredith," which was rather a 
pity, because a prejudice was thus created against 
the book in the minds of discriminating observers, 
and its popularity was made to appear more arti- 
ficial than deserved. As a matter of fact, it was 
good enough to win its way without being "boomed " 
or " boosted," and stands out among the best recent 
romances of its class. It has the uncommon merit 
of being based upon a genuinely scholarly know- 
ledge of its period, without suffering from the obtru- 
sion of learning, or having its romantic and senti- 
mental interest in any way impaired. 



THE DETACHED METHOD IN 
LITERATURE, 

Perhaps the great French critics are the com- 
pletest modern examples of personal detachment 
from literary work ; but English and American 
students of life have conspicuously tried to escape 
their native bias. To be able to externalize one's 
environment, to get an outside view of one's dog- 
mas, is deemed so necessary that the first step upon 
discovering an artistic faculty is to move to a 
metropolis and view past experiences and present 
emotions from that vantage-ground. 

Only recently has this been done with conscious 
eye upon the perspective. The blind impulse to 
get into a larger stream of life used to be the 
motive ; or the need of a recognition not to be 
found in provincial society, — as when Dr. Samuel 



Johnson made his way to London. The great 
Doctor would, indeed, have resented any intimation 
that he was trying to get away from the moral and 
intellectual atmosphere in which he was reared. 
His opinion upon " apostasy," as he would have 
termed it, from one's education, was very decided. 
As the Seward letters report, he professed that 
" if he had been educated in the Roman Catholic 
faith, he would have questioned his right to quit 
the religion of his fathers." Stubbornly as he was 
bent upon adhering to the tenets he was born to, 
Dr. Johnson must have suffered intensification or 
enlargement of ideas by his migration from Lich- 
field ; and upon the impressionable and vivid 
mind of Shakespeare the London journey doubtless 
wrought more deeply still. It brought to the 
dramatist that quickening of observation and 
memory which is so much more to the dramatic 
than to the philosophic observer of life. The 
details of his Stratford impressions must have 
started out in his mind, sensitivized by exile, fresh 
and full of color as they rarely appear to the 
familiar eye. Follies, customs, speech, naked 
human nature, unreflectingly absorbed long before, 
came out with the enchanting picturesqueness dis- 
tance lends. " Justice Shallow " moved across his 
fellow-townsman's field of vision, in all the pomp 
and circumstance of his official position, and withal 
without the over-emphasis which irritated daily 
companionship would have given. All the tender- 
ness of years of separation softened the medium 
through which the observer in city pent surveyed 
the fair rural Warwick of his boyhood. 

Jane Austen is the only notable instance I can 
now recall of a dramatic portrayer of contemporary 
English manners who gives the effect of perspective 
in her picture, subdues the whole to artistic propor- 
tions, without effecting this objective treatment by 
bodily removal from the scenes she depicts. The 
quiet humdrum society in which she lived was 
irradiated for her by the lambent light of an inex- 
tinguishable humor. The fine delicate touch is 
that of serene detachment, not too complete and 
removed for understanding. 

For satirists, such unexaggerated views are not 
essential. One can attack abases from which one 
saffers acute and present misery, the more fitly and 
definitely for the pain. The caricature derives its 
ingenious power to torment from the isolation of 
certain qualities, the bias of the treatment. Bat 
the gentle, mellow outline of nature, the nothing 
too much, the modelling of a figure without the 
distortion of dislike or the harshness of incomplete 
comprehension, is not to be done in the heat of 
controversy. The exquisite grace of a day that is 
dead may be deplored, but it is the better artistic- 
ally since it cannot come back in its crude emphatic 
salience. 

Situations may press too close for the play of 
wit or fancy, but individuality presses closer still, 
and getting away from that is a far more subtle 
matter. A mind uncolored by habit, preposses-

sion, or feeling, would be a difficalt achievement. 
Barns's "see oursel' as ithers see us" seems to 
offer a rough-and-ready substitute for the absolute 
insight. There is the danger, however, of only 
exchanging one narrow circle for another. Some 
" ithers " bring to bear upon one's shrinking 
idiosyncrasies the unsympathetic glare of opposite 
tastes and virtue. What benefit accrues to a Foe 
from seeing himself as a Griswold sees him? 
Would Hawthorne have gained by accepting the 
village valuation of himself — that village from 
whose opinions he had to shut himself off, to gain 
self-confidence enough to carry on his work? 

Seeing life steadily and seeing it whole comes 
not from reading it through other people's eyes. 
We all know what befell " tender personed Lamia " 
in Keats's poem, when the cold skeptical eye of 
reason penetrated her warm love-trance. One's 
neighbors usually bring, beside this perceant skep- 
ticism, an active disapproval and non-comprehension 
of one's aim. " Know thyself " was the Delphic 
oracle, — but no method was suggested. The true 
Pythic calm would surely not be reached by 
adopting the strabismus of others in addition to 
one's own. 

Nobody would have been worse confounded 
than Burns if the giftie had granted his petition, 
and the sensitive perception of others' disap- 
proval had suddenly been thrust upon him. The 
virility that bubbled up so easefuUy in his song 
would have been ill exchanged for the tact that 
holds its finger upon the popular pulse. Well for 
us that Robert Bnrns's nature had its roots too far 
back in the ploughing, love-making, peasant days 
of Ayr, to be transplanted into the conventional and 
artificial methods of the letters of his day. If, as 
Sudermann maintains in his novel " Es War," 
repentance is an emasculating exercise, destructive 
of the peace it seeks, surely the effort to view 
ourselves as others do, — and that is generally 
satirically, sometimes despondently, — cannot pro- 
duce peace of mind. The dramatist may find it 
profitable; but the lyrical poet, or the man of 
action, leans for strength upon his subjective 
energy, and that is as liable to collapse from the 
intrusion of alien forces as was Lamia's palpi- 
tating loveliness. Fortunately, the subjective type 
is usually impervious to the opinions of others. If 
Napoleon had been as acutely sensitive to public 
approval as Josephine was, he would have made 
but a poor figure in the world. Detachment, 
then, however desirable for critics and dramatists, 
seems to be in its infancy as a lay endowment, 
because of its difficulty of attainment. Whims and 
prejudices and personal bias serve their end in 
urging us toward definite goals, and give color 
to the material upon which the student of life 
works. Even if this were not so, these distinctive 
traits are not to be escaped by every mind, — 
" nearer are they than breathing, closer than 
hands and feet." ^^^^ g_ Swinney.

A Worthy Disciplb of .^Esculapius.* 



Earnest, purposeful, strenuously industrious 
— such was the life of the late Sir James Paget, 
and we close the book that pictures so faith- 
fully his long and useful career, with a feeling 
of gladness that such a man has lived. 

Ever since the appearance of the " Religio 
Medici " a peculiar interest has attached to the 
self -revelations of a physician. Perhaps it is 
the old conflict between religion and science 
that is at the bottom of this interest. " Three 
physicians, two atheists," was a saying common 
in Browne's day, and is still not without a 
measure of truth. But in Paget the highest 
scientific attainments were united with the 
loftiest spiritual faith and the most constant 
devotion to the claims of religion. That in 
him physic did not crowd out metaphysic may 
be seen in a brief passage from one of his rou- 
tine lectures on the functions of the brain. 

« Other portions of the human mind are the reason, 
and the conscience ... by which there is established 
between man and the brutes a great difference, not in 
degree alone, but in kind. The spirit differs from all 
the faculties in its independence of our organization: 
for it is exercised best in complete abstraction from all 
that is sensible; it is wholly independent of the organi- 
zation of the brain; wholly independent also of the 
education of the understanding." 

Even an outline of Paget's life of ceaseless 
activity and well-earned honors would more 
than fill our available space. He was born at 
Yarmouth in 1814, being one of seventeen 
children, nine of whom reached maturity, and 
he had to contend with a lack of means that 
finally amounted to poverty ; but the young 
man welcomed each obstacle as an incentive to 
renewed effort and an earnest of ultimate suc- 
cess. His fine scorn, in later life, of the eight- 
hour movement is reminiscent of his own 
fourteen and sixteen hours of daily toil. With 
two of his brothers, the young practitioner 
seeking a practice assumed the debts of his 
bankrupt father, and was not content until, at 
the end of twenty years, he had hunted up and 
paid in full, principal and interest, the last of 
the claims against the elder Paget. Cherishing 
a family pride like that of Thomas Martineau's 
children, he could not bear to leave the reproach

of insolvency against his honored father's 
name. 

Some of the achievements of James Paget's 
student days at St. Bartholomew's Hospital 
are notable. In four or five days he read up 
medical jurisprudence, and, at the competitive 
examination, bore off the highest honors in this 
as well as in his other studies. He enjoyed 
almost a monopoly in his ability to read Ger- 
man with ease, and found himself in the curious 
position of tutor to his instructors when medical 
intelligence from Germany was called for. 
Other languages he quickly acquired for pur- 
poses of his profession. A noteworthy per- 
formance of his still earlier years illustrates his 
bent for natural science. While yet under 
twenty, he prepared an exhaustive flora — 1185 
plants — of his native Yarmouth, publishing 
it with an elder brother's equally careful study 
of the fauna, and accompanying it with obser- 
vations on the distribution and modification of 
species that read like prolegomena to the 
" Origin of Species," which was still a quarter 
of a century in the future. A valuable contribu- 
tion to medical science was his discovery, by the 
aid of a borrowed microscope, of the trichina 
spiralis, which Professor Virchow has since 
made the subject of more extended study. He 
found time and means to vary the monotony 
of his 'prentice days by a three-months visit to 
Paris hospitals and lecture-rooms. Writing 
home, he speaks with extreme disgust of the 
ruffianly appearance of the unwashed and un- 
shaven medical students, with their ragged 
coats and wooden shoes. He regrets to see 
even some of his own countrymen lapsing into 
a like uncouthness ; " however," he adds, " I 
hope a great deal of the worst is to be set 
down to the Americans, of whom a great many 
are, I know, studying here." We hope he was 
mistaken. Surely Dr. Holmes, who studied 
in Paris a few years earlier, gives no such im- 
pression in his account of Louis's " faithful 
band of almost worshipping students," and in 
his picture of the knot of Bostonians and Phila- 
delphians that used to breakfast at the Cafe 
Procope, where Jouffroy and other famous or 
soon-to-be- famous men also took their morning 
coffee. Another fling at Americans — and 
this time at American women — is found in a 
letter to Sir Joseph Hooker on the proposed 
admission of women-doctors to the International 
Medical Congress held in London in 1881. 
" I am influenced towards a negative posture 
in this case," he says, " by what I have heard 
of some of the American and Zurich women- 



doctors, whom it would be difficult to exclude, 
though few decent Englishmen would like to 
be associated with them." Such disparaging 
remarks from one so kindly and charitable and 
so careful in weighing his words, are the more 
noteworthy as the utterances of a man who was 
loaded with honors by American scientific so- 
cieties and who came to have a wide circle of 
warm friends in this country. 

Apropos of his friendships, a few of the good 
things in which the book abounds must find a 
place here. At the dinner following Paget's 
delivery of the Hunterian oration before the 
College of Surgeons in 1877, Mr. Gladstone, 
a close friend of his, proposed the orator's 
health in a little speech in which he divided 
mankind into two classes, — the happy minor- 
ity who had heard the address, and the to-be- 
pitied majority who by their fault or misfortune 
had not. "There is only one way," said Paget 
in responding to the toast, " in which it may 
be possible to surpass Mr. Gladstone as an 
orator, and that way I will proceed to put in 
practice. You all know that though speech may 
be silvern, silence is golden. You shall have 
the gold." Not a few eminent authors and 
scientists were Sir James's friends and admir- 
ers. We see him sitting with Romanes on one 
side and Browning on the other, laughing with 
hearty zest at the latter's story of his faithless 
Italian maid-servant who pilfered his tea and 
then, conscience-stricken, stole his candles to 
burn before a little shrine in expiation of the 
theft. His admiration for George Eliot and 
his enjoyment of her novels is in somewhat 
significant contrast with his difficulty in get- 
ting through " Marcella " one stormy day in 
the country. With Lowell he was on the 
friendliest of terms. "They were made for 
each other," says Paget's son. In their hearty 
liking for the English climate the two were 
certainly at one. As after-dinner speakers 
they enjoyed a nearly equal repute. The late 
Mr. Justice Denman said, " I once heard, at 
a dinner of the Royal Society, the late Lord 
Coleridge, Mr. Lowell, then American Ambas- 
sador, Sir James Paget, and Mr. Huxley, all 
speak on the same evening; and the general 
opinion put Lowell first and Paget next." A 
short letter from Lowell to Paget, not included 
in Mr. Norton's collection, is so characteristic 
in its happy phrasing, and so illustrative of the 
esteem entertained for Sir James by all who 
knew him, as to warrant insertion here. 

"If anything could add to the pleasure of dining 
with you, it would be that of meeting Lord Acton. He

and in his case that is saying a great deal. I well 
remember in what terms he spoke of you ; and shall 
not say whether I agreed with him or not, because my 
opinion could add no weight to his. You see I am 
wandering from the point (like every after-dinner 
speaker but you) — but it is only because I would fain 
put off saying that I am unfortunate enough to be 
engaged for Thursday. I can only say I wish I 
weren't ! " 

Our editor has some pleasant things to 
record of Lowell, and collects a number of his 
wise and witty sayings that have never before 
been in print. 

A baronetcy was conferred upon Paget in 
1871, when he had been already thirteen 
years, in his professional capacity, a member 
of the queen's household. He died in 1899. 
His fame as a physician rests chiefly on his 
work in surgical pathology, wherein he serves 
as one of the links connecting the old Hun- 
terian surgery with that of the last quarter- 
century. His son Stephen has admirably edited 
and supplemented his autobiography and let- 
ters, adding Millais' portrait of Sir James and 
other portraits and illustrations. 

Scant space remains in which to notice the 
" Essays and Addresses." Though almost 
wholly on medical subjects, many of them 
hold the lay reader a willing captive by their 
clear and engaging style. Such are, for ex- 
ample, the chapters on " Stammering with 
Other Organs than Those of Speech," " What 
Becomes of Medical Students," " Theology and 
Science," "Nervous Mimicry," and "Errors 
in the Chronometry of Life."

IjIncoliN's PLiAn of Reconstruction.* 

A whole generation of men has passed from 
the stage of human affairs since the legal 
adjustment of conflicting purposes for the 
reconstruction of State governments in the 
rebellious South ; yet for thirty years such has 
been the conflict of opinion and the resulting 
current of events that one may say today with 
a large measure of truth that the work of 
Reconstruction is still incomplete. 

Three days before his death Mr. Lincoln 
said : 

D " I have been shown a letter ... in which the writer 
expresses regret that my mind has not seemed to be 
definitely fixed on the question whether the seceded 

•Lincoln's Plan of Reconstruction. By Charles H. 
McCarthy. New York : McClure, Phillips & Co. 



States, so called, are in the Union or out of it. . . . 
As appears to me, that question has not been, nor yet 
is, a practically material one, and that any discussion 
of it while it thus remains practically immaterial could 
have no effect other than the mischievous one of divid- 
ing our friends. As yet, whatever it may hereafter 
become, that question is bad as the basis of a contro- 
versy, and good for nothing at all — a mere pernicious 
abstraction. We all agree that the seceded States, so 
called, are out of their proper practical relation with 
the Union, and that the sole object of the Government, 
civil and military, in regard to those States, is to again 
get them into that proper practical relation. I believe 
that it is not only possible, but, in fact, easier, to do 
this without deciding or even considering whether these 
States have ever been out of the Union than with it. 
Finding themselves safely at home, it would be utterly 
immaterial whether they had ever been abroad. Let 
us join in doing the acts necessary to restoring the 
proper practical relations between these States and the 
Union, and each forever after innocently indulge his 
own opinion whether in doing the acts he brought the 
States from without into the Union, or only gave them 
proper assistance, they never having been out of it." 

Here, in a few sentences, is Mr. Lincoln's 
plan for Reconstruction ; and it may be called 
the paternal plan. Not explicitly, but tacitly 
and practically, it is based upon the theory for 
which the war had been undertaken by the 
North — that the Union is perpetual, and that 
a State may not secede. At the same time, it 
met the protest of such practical minds as that 
of Thaddeus Stevens — that a State can secede, 
and that in fact eleven did so act — by the con- 
cession that " the seceded States, so called, are 
out of their proper and practical relation with 
the Union." The eminently practical mind of 
the great President recognized what so many of 
his contemporaries failed to grasp : that polit- 
ical theories and the actual events of life do 
not always coincide. Thomas Williams, of 
Pennsylvania, well expressed the truth in his 
remarks in the House, April 29, 1864, when 
he said that in the minds of the framers of 
the Constitution the theory of an indissoluble 
Union referred to the right, to its organic law; 
but that the Union could be ruptured by vio- 
lence. Mr. Stevens himself, four days later, 
put it concisely when he said : " What are we 
making war upon them for? For seceding; 
for going out of the Union against law. The 
law forbids a man to rob or murder, and yet 
robbing and murder exist defactOj but not de 
jure^ 

The problem of Reconstruction was there- 
fore not an easy one; it was exceedingly diffi- 
cult to make a harmony of theory and fact. 
On the one hand were the Constitution and 
the perpetual pact ; on the other were the 
violated law and the offenders. Men like

Lincoln and Stevens, who agreed thoroughly 
as to the theory of the Union, fixed their 
attention, after the event of secession, poles 
apart. Lincoln's mind was on the indissoluble 
Union ; Stevens saw before all else the violat- 
ors of the law. Lincoln's desire to restore the 
status quo dwarfed all questions of method ; 
to Stevens the status quo was worth restoring 
only on certain conditions and with certain 
guarantees for the future. The one thought 
upon the returned and restored prodigal; the 
other elaborated pains and penalties. If Mr. 
Lincoln's was the paternal plan, that of Mr. 
Stevens was the penitentiary one. 

Mr. Lincoln died on the eve of the Recon- 
struction period, and his successor was soon at 
war with the leaders of Congressional opinion. 
It has always been an open question to thought- 
ful men, how far the great leader, if he had 
lived, would have determined the facts of 
Keconstruction. The issue that was made, 
early in 1864 in the first session of the Thirty- 
eighth Congress, when Henry Winter Davis 
and Senator Wade brought in a bill which 
ignored the administration's policy of restora- 
tion in Louisiana, foreboded a conflict ; and 
although it was for the time averted, the desire 
to punish the rebellious South, and to make 
sure of the abolition of slavery, was too strong 
to be permanently set aside. Yet one may 
reasonably cherish the belief that, had the 
leader lived who far more than any other man 
concerned with the rebellion commanded the 
confidence of his fellow-countrymen, some of 
the harsher features of Reconstruction as car- 
ried out would have been avoided. Whilst it 
is true that the opposition to Mr. Lincoln was 
based only partly on his plan, and was directed 
also at his independence in the initiation of a 
policy, we can agree with the latest biographer 
of Thaddeus Stevens,Congressman McCall, that 
if Lincoln had lived " his fine political sagacity 
and his popularity with the people might not 
have been strong enough to carry through his 
plan of Reconstruction, but we can at least feel 
sure that his moderation would have averted 
any serious rupture ; that he would not have 
been dragged to the bar of the Senate in 
impeachment proceedings, and that Congress, 
under the lead of Stevens, would not have 
wielded the supreme power." 

Mr. Charles H. McCarthy has very happily 
gathered into his volume on " Lincoln's Plan 
of Reconstruction " the lines of policy that lie 
about the purpose of President Lincoln. In 
the first four chapters he discusses the admin- 



istrative efforts to restore to the Union Ten- 
nessee, Lousiana, and Arkansas, and the for- 
mation of the new State of West Virginia. 
Through all these tentative efforts, whether in 
what was contemptuously called the " ten per 
cent " policy in the three Southwestern States, 
or in the recognition in the " Old Dominion " 
of a minority vote setting free the western por- 
tion of the State, Mr. Lincoln was clear in his 
own mind. What he said in the case of Virginia 
applies to all : 

" The consent of the Legislature of Virginia is con- 
stitutionally necessary to the bill for the admission of 
West Virginia becoming a law. A body claiming to be 
such a legislature has given its consent. We cannot 
well deny it is such unless we do so upon the outside 
knowledge that the body was chosen at elections in 
which a majority of the qualified voters of Virginia 
did not participate. But it is a universal practice in 
the popular elections in all these States to give no legal 
consideration whatever to those who do not choose to 
vote, as against the effect of the votes of those who do 
choose to vote. Hence it is not the qualified voters, 
but the qualified voters who choose to vote, that consti- 
tute the political power of the State. Much less than 
to non-voters should any consideration be given to 
those who did not vote in this case, because it is also 
matter of outside knowledge that they are not merely 
neglectful of their rights under and duty to this govern- 
ment, but were also engaged in open rebellion against 
it. . . . Can this Government stand if it indulges con- 
stitutional constructions by which men in open rebellion 
against it are to be accounted, man for man, the equals 
of those who maintain their loyalty to it ? " 

The sixth chapter, a most instructive one, 
" Theories and Plans of Reconstruction," pre- 
sents the President's plan, Sumner's theory 
of " State suicide," the " conquered territory " 
theory of Stevens, and the view persistently 
held by many Northern Democrats that only 
the final event of the war could determine 
whether the rebellious States were in or out of 
the Union. The President's plan assumed not 
only that the Union was indestructible, but 
also that individuals rather than States were 
in rebellion, and that individuals rather than 
States were to be brought to terms. Mr. 
Sumner's theory held that the act of the de 
facto rulers of a State is the act of that State, 
and that secession involved " a practical abdi- 
cation by the State of all rights under the 
Constitution . . . and the State being, accord- 
ing to the language of the law, felo de - se, 
ceases to exist." 

Mr. Stevens's theory was too much that of 
a legalist, in some of its features, to be satis- 
factory to a lover of the Constitution in its 
spirit as well as its letter.

bar of our action. . . . The Constitution ! Our Con- 
stitution, which you repudiate and trample under foot,

acy, or he has no business to be in court at all. . . . 
Those who bring in this plea here, in bar of our action, 
are the advocates of rebels; they are speaking for them 
and not for us — who are the plaintiffs in this trans- 
action." 

The plaintiffs ! Never once did the mind of 
this acute lawyer rise above that narrow con- 
ception of the constitutional defence of the 
Union. To Mr. Lincoln, the cause of the Union 
was that of a sovereign government and a sov- 
ereign people, and not of a mere plaintiff at 
the bar. 

The seventh chapter of Mr. McCarthy's 
work deals with " The Rise of the Congressional 
Plan," and gives in detail the discussions in 
both houses, during the first half of 1864, of 
the bill introduced by Henry Winter Davis 
and Senator Wade. This bill, which was 
vetoed by President Lincoln, repudiated the 
President's " ten per cent " States and their 
reconstructed governments, and claimed the 
right for Congress " to reorganize governments 
in those States, to impose such conditions as it 
thinks necessary to secure the permanence of 
republican government, to refuse to recognize 
any governments there which do not prohibit 
slavery forever." Mr. Lincoln thought that 
slavery could be abolished only by an amend- 
ment to the Constitution, and said : 

" This bill and the position of these gentlemen seem 
to me, in asserting that the insurrectionary States are 
no longer in the Union, to make the fatal admission that 
States, whenever they please, may of their own motion 
dissolve their connection with the Union. Now, we 
cannot survive that admission, I am convinced." 

In the Congress that met in December, 
1864, an attempt was made to revive the 
Davis -Wade bill, with the modification of 
recognizing the "ten per cent " States already 
organized by the administration. This meas- 
ure was unsuccessful ; and equally so was an 
attempt by the friends of the administration 
to have the State of Louisiana recognized inde- 
pendently of a general Reconstruction measure. 
There was a drawn battle, at the close of which 
the President's death changed the whole situa- 
tion. This conflict of forces within the triumph- 
ant Republican party is fully presented in the 
eighth, ninth, and tenth chapters ; while the 
final chapter notes the " Culmination of the 
Presidential Plan " in the application of it by 
his successor, and to final discomfiture at the 
hands of Congress. In this chapter the author 



for the first time becomes something more than 
a narrator, and enters into a critical examina- 
tion as to the modes of initiating Reconstruc- 
tion, the character of the reconstructed govern- 
ments, and the limitations of the Presidential 
plan. He finds four modes of instituting the 
renewed governments : by a movement originat- 
ing with the loyal people, as in West Virginia j 
by Presidential initiative, as in Tennessee, 
Arkansas, and Louisiana ; by the expiring 
power of the Confederacy's local governors, 
as in Mississippi, Georgia, and Texas ; and 
by Congressional authority, as finally in all 
the eleven States except West Virginia and 
Tennessee. All of these methods are charac- 
terized as irregular, but the last is approved as 
least open to objection. The author's closing 
remarks may well be quoted : 

" However crude we may now consider Mr. Lin- 
coln's system, it should not be forgotten that with hin» 
the paramount consideration was the overthrow of the 
Confederacy. With that purpose all his measures har- 
monized, and it is scarcely critical to examine them 
from any other point of view. How far necessity, 
which had originally suggested, would subsequently 
have modified his plan, it is now impossible to state. 
Without detracting a particle from his well-won fame 
it may be admitted that his method, which could not 
have foreseen the rapid succession of changes following 
his death, was but indifferently adapted to solve the 
problem with which Congress was compelled to deal in 
1867; but the measure of permanent success which 
attended the deliberate legislation of that body by no 
means justified the conclusion that some other system 
would have proved a total failure. With all its imma- 
turity, the plan of the President was not without its 
advantages. It aimed to restore, with as little innova- 
tion as possible, the Union of the Fathers; with some 
exceptions the natural leaders of Southern society were 
to participate in the work of reorganization; and the 
author of this simple plan approached his difficult task 
in a generous and enlightened spirit." 

The substance of Mr. McCarthy's book is 
better than his method. There is at times a 
lack of continuity, and a returning upon itself 
of the narrative which makes it difficult to see 
the relation of events. Especially in the case 
of the States restored by the President, is it 
difficult to get the calendar of the story. The 
narrative in Arkansas proceeds to May, 1861 ; 
then falls back, without notice, to February ; 
then goes on in May. Mr. Pierpont is elected 
Governor of Virginia for a term beginning 
January 1, 1864, and immediately in his mes- 
sage makes a recommendation which is acted 
on by the Legislature December 21, 1863. 
On page 47 Thomas J. Durant is made the 
leader of the anti-slavery faction in Louisiana ; 
on page 63 he is called the spokesman of "the 
conservative element whose interests opposed

any disturbance of existing conditions." On 
page 203 there is an unprofitable attempt to 
prove that Mr. Sumner was in the wrong in 
considering that James the Second demitted 
the English crown by abdication. On page 
434 we are told that " when the last of the 
Federal soldiers had set their faces toward the 
sea, the city of Atlanta was little more than a 
mass of smoking ruins." In his " Memoirs," 
General Sherman says that the fire which 
Colonel Roe, by his orders, had set to the rail- 
road shops, through an explosion " also reached 
the block of stores near the depot, and the 
heart of the city was in flames, but the fire 
did not reach the parts of Atlanta where the 
courthouse was, or the great mass of dwelling- 
houses." The annexed correspondence shows 
that the intention was merely to destroy that 
portion of the city which was a fortified place 
and an arsenal of supplies. Old residents tell 
the same story to those who visit Atlanta to-day. 
The author has esteemed too lightly his func- 
tion as critic. One feels that the opposing 
plans represented by Lincoln, by Henry Win- 
ter Davis, and by Stevens, are not sufficiently 
characterized ; and he gets a less clear view of 
their constitutional relationships from this work 
devoted to a single topic than from such a 
treatise as McCall's Life of Stevens, to which 
Reconstruction is only a part of the story.

An American Translation of Dante.* 



The late Eugene Schuyler rather wickedly 
remarked concerning Longfellow's translation 
of Dante : " You cannot possibly understand 
it unless you have read the original." This 
jibe is somewhat less injurious than it sounds, 
for it is in a measure true of all verse transla- 
tions of Dante, among which Longfellow's is 
not the least intelligible. What makes verse 
translations, with a few shining exceptions, so 
disappointing is the fact that their form natur- 
ally arouses an expectation which is sadly dis- 
appointed. Except as a vehicle for poetry, what 
excuse for being has verse? The function of 
a verse translation should be to give some im- 
pression of the artistic form of the original, 
some touch of its animating principle, to make 
a similar appeal to the sense of beauty. If a 
metrical version fails to give such an impres- 

*The Divine Comedy of Dante Alighieri. Trans- 
lated by Charles Eliot Norton. Revised edition. In three 
volumes : Boston : Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 



sion, to make such an appeal, it is like salt that 
has lost its savor. From a prose translation of 
a poem less is expected : it serves its humble 
purpose if it afford an accurate and spirited 
rendering of so much of the meaning of the 
original as may still persist after the disinte- 
gration of the poem as a work of art. Thi» 
residue chances to be, in the case of the Divine 
Comedy, of weight and value ; moreover, the 
difficulties in the way of the modern reader 
who would feel the full glory and divineness of 
the poem are so great that a faithful transla- 
tion is not to be despised. Even the Italians 
have their prose version, printed face to face 
with the original, nor do they shame to con- 
sult it. Similar apparatus is provided by the 
editors of the well-known " Temple Classics,'^ 
who give us the fine prose translations of the 
Inferno by Dr. Carlyle, of the Purgatorio by 
Mr. Okey, of the Paradiso by Mr. Wicksteed, 
in compact and attractive form face to face 
with the original text. The object of this edi- 
tion is plainly to facilitate the study of the 
original. In a note appended to his translation 
Mr. Okey remarks with truth and point: " Of 
the supreme poets none loses so much by trans- 
lation as Dante ; none so quickly repays a study 
of the original text. Many passages indeed 
are clearer in Italian than in English." This 
should not be forgotten when Mr. Schuyler's 
fling at Longfellow is recalled. 

The three translations issued in the " Tem- 
ple Classics " have high and various merits ; 
still, the very fact that they are by different 
men deprives them of that uniformity of tex- 
ture and tone that marks the work of Dante. 
It is pleasant to know that there is a complete 
translation by an honored American scholar 
the merits of which are incontestible, perhaps 
incomparable. When Professor Charles Eliot 
Norton first published his prose translation of 
Dante in 1891, its excellence was widely rec- 
ognized, — so widely that a dozen reprints of 
at least one part of it were called for within a 
decade. Last autumn Professor Norton com- 
pleted a thorough-going revision of his great 
work, which now comes to us in its definitive 
form from the Riverside Press. A critical 
comparison of this with the earlier version is 
necessary in order to enable one to realize the 
significance of the author's quiet statement 
that he has " given, perhaps, as much time to 
the revision as to the original making of the 
translation." Indeed, the alterations, both in 
sense and syntax, are so many and often so 
radical, that the revision is essentially a new 



346

[May 16, 



version. The changes fall into two classes : 
those whose purpose was to make the style 
more flowing and the diction more idiomatic ; 
and those by which the author seeks to render 
Dante's thought with increased precision and 
deeper fidelity. It is safe to assert that the 
translator has taken cognizance of the textual 
corrections and the happier interpretations of 
recent decades, and that nothing is here set 
down at random. Inasmuch, however, as the 
former version was also deeply considered, it 
remains true that the changes in the sense are 
often of a kind to invite the famous verdict of 
Sir Roger De Coverley. They represent the 
deliberate interpretations of Professor Norton 
to-day as opposed to the interpretations of the 
same authority a dozen years ago. It is but 
natural that there should be instances in the 
case of which some will prefer the earlier read- 
ing. The very first sentence of the poem af- 
fords a case in point. The earlier version was : 
" Midway upon the road of our life I found myself 
within a dark wood, for the right way had been 
missed." 

The following is the revised version, with the 
changes made noticeable by italics : 

" Midway upon the journey of our life I found myself 
in a dark wood, where the right way was lost." 

Far the most important of the above altera- 
tions is the change oifor to where. The change 
represents a fundamentally different conception 
of Dante's moral and theological attitude. 
Formerly the translator made Dante say that 
a man deviates from the straight and narrow 
way because of an inward declension, a spiritual 
blindness, which is symbolized by the slumber 
that possessed him when he " abandoned the 
true way." Now, on the other hand, the trans- 
lator makes Dante imply that a man goes astray 
morally by reason of mere outward temptations 
and obstacles. Perhaps he is right about 
Dante's attitude ; Scartazzini does not think 
so ; others do not think so ; and, however it 
may be, the change seems to involve some sacri- 
fice of spiritual significance, of universal truth. 

Whatever one may think of this or that 
change in the reading, everyone must admire 
the literary skill displayed in the changes in 
diction and word-order. Professor Norton's 
diction bears witness to a taste more nearly 
faultless than is exhibited by other translators 
of Dante. The notes, which in the former 
version were too scanty, have been increased 
in number many-fold, and now give a succinct 
explanation, whenever the explanation is known, 
of every obscure passage or allusion. Detailed 



comparison of this translation with Carlyle's 
of the Inferno or with Mr. Wicksteed's of the 
Paradiso tends to deepen one's admiration of 
Mr. Norton's work. The American translation 
is somewhat severer in style than the others, 
frequently exhibiting a distinct preference for 
significant Latinisms in Dante's diction for 
which the English translators prefer the more 
vivid purely English synonyms. Not that 
Mr. Norton's translation is unduly Latinized ; 
on the contrary, it is extremely idiomatic, and 
more so in the present than in the former ver- 
sion. Mr. Norton further shows the purity of 
his taste in eschewing archaisms, except per- 
haps when the language of Dante is distinctly 
scriptural ; and in the avoidance of metrical 
effects. In Mr. Wicksteed's charming and 
spirited version of the Paradiso the light- winged 
prose is continually hovering on the verge of 
verse — sometimes sliding into it. It may be 
questioned whether there is not some element 
of the meretricious in such a confusion of the 
two harmonies of prose and of verse. The 
superiority of Mr. Norton's taste is decisively 
revealed in the uniformity of tone which is 
preserved throughout: the tone and the har- 
mony of noble modern prose. It is unfortunate 
that there is no space here for examples which 
would give point to these observations. The 
reviewer can only record his own conclusion 
that no other version of the whole poem known 
to him, and no other combination of versions 
of the three several parts, can be said to equal 
Mr. Norton's in the application of the higher 
qualities of taste and style to the faithful ren- 
dition of Dante's thought in prose. In its 
union of the prime qualities of fidelity and 
idiomatic felicity, this masterly translation is 
probably unrivalled. No doubt it will have a 
permanent place as an English classic.

An Explanation op Robespierre.* 

In the examination of a biographical work 
on so important a historical character as Robes- 
pierre, three questions at once present them- 
selves : Have new sources or material been 
discovered? Have the old and well-known 
sources been correctly used ? Is there merit 
shown in analysis and in literary presentation ? 
In the present volume the first of these may 
be dismissed at once, for Mr. Belloc prefaces 

* Robespierre. A Study. By Hilaire Belloc, B.A. With 
portrait. New York : Charles Scribner'a Sons. 



1902.] 



THE DIAL 



347 



his work with a disclaimer. It is his belief 
that there is greater need of intelligent study 
of materials already within reach than of search 
for altogether new light. In recognition of 
this need he has undertaken the present study. 
The result of his labor is a volume that bears 
on its every page evidence of that conscientious 
care and analysis which were, in the writer's 
mind, the first essentials. 

Now when a man of Mr. Belloc's known 
ability and honesty of purpose essays such an 
important examination as this one, and when 
its perusal shows such extreme care, there is 
surely reason for the prediction that, in so far 
as the facts of history are concerned, a just 
discrimination in the use of materials may be 
expected. It is only in part, however, that 
such a prediction is verified. It would perhaps 
be hypercritical to attack the author's old-time 
presentation of the Kevolution as a sudden 
emergence and as a series of cataclysms, — as 
when, writing of the results of the National 
Assembly, it is stated that " it was in the na- 
ture of this crisis that the immediate past fell 
out of sight altogether. There stood between 
'89 and '90 the strange barrier between sleep 
and waking." Such misstatements may be 
pardoned in the exigencies of dramatic analysis. 
But it is otherwise when materials are avowedly 
accepted as authoritative which lack the first 
requisites of true sources. Mr. Belloc's ac- 
count of Robespierre's youth and early man- 
hood is founded upon the memoirs of Charlotte 
Robespierre. He not only accepts them as 
genuine, but, basing an analysis of character 
upon the sister's description, he makes that 
analysis the centre and crux of the later de- 
velopment of his hero. The trustworthiness 
of these memoirs is then a question of prime 
importance, yet they have usually been regarded 
as a forgery. The author asserts their authen- 
ticity, and has made a clever argument in sup- 
port of his contention. Yet, admitting this 
argument to be convincing and final, the mem- 
oirs do not constitute a reliable source. It is 
at least clear that they were written years after 
the events they purport to narrate, that they 
were amplified by Laperronaye in such a man- 
ner as to render it impossible to distinguish 
between original and alterations, and that, at 
the best, they constitute a solitary, isolated 
statement of facts unsupported by other wit- 
nesses. To accept such material as a final 
source is to discredit that modern school of 
scientific history to which Mr. Belloc's country- 
men have contributed so largely. 



Along the same lines is the author's assump- 
tion of Robespierre's unimportance in the sum- 
mer of 1789, because " for months the half 
ofiicial Moniteur does not mention his name." 
This mistake has become almost a classic. The 
Moniteur in fact did not begin publication until 
November of 1789, and it was not until years 
had elapsed that the earlier numbers, dating 
from May, were published in order to make 
the file complete for so interesting a period of 
history. Necessarily, citations from the Moni- 
teur for this period have no true historical 
value. In minor matters there are occasional 
errors in the statement of events of importance. 
The Berlin treaty of February, 1792, between 
Austria and Prussia, was certainly not due 
primarily to the intrigues of Catherine II. of 
Russia, but was rather the completion of a 
diplomatic reversal begun in the Vienna Con- 
vention of the previous year, by which Leo- 
pold II. gained a friend in the king of Prussia. 
Both Van Sybel and Sorel have proved this 
beyond question. Nor is that view correct 
which shows the Girondists in July of 1792 as 
imbued with a great idea, " the vision of a free 
world." The famous decree offering aid to 
" nations in bondage " was not passed until 
November of that year, and then only by acci- 
dent, and with no conception of its real import. 

When, however, we turn to the question 
of analysis and literary presentation, Mr. 
Belloc's work at once takes rank with the 
best historical essays. Granting him his 
premises, his characterizations of Robespierre 
and of contemporary events are altogether 
logical, and are presented in a style that 
forces an absorbed attention. Robespierre, as 
the author sees him, belonged to that class of 
country lawyers who, imbued with the spirit 
of anti-revolutionary philosophy, systematized 
that philosophy into a code of principles, and, 
with a hard logic, judged all men and events 
by its formulas. 

" He took the first postulates of the ' Contrat Social ' 
for granted. . . . He deduced from them, and still 
deduced, with a fatal accuracy of process, with a fatal 
ignorance of things, and with no appreciation of the 
increasing chances of error, until his deductions had 
departed prodigiously from their starting point, and 
began to prove themselves in every practical applica- 
tion absurd." 

Thus the atmosphere in which Robespierre 
lived was one of political dogmatism. He was 
one of those fanatics who 

" Attach themselves to some principle which is either 
highly probable, or generally acceptable, or even self- 
evident, and armed with this truth which few care (and 
sometimes none are able) to deny, they proceed to a 



348

thousand applications of their rule which they lay 
down as an iron standard, crushing the multiple irregu- 
larities of living things. Of these it has been well said 
that they go to the devil by logic." 

Imbued with these circumscribed ideals, 
Robespierre entered the National Assembly 
of 1789. He was " unreasonable logic incar- 
nate," yet his reputation grew steadily by his 
pertinacity in criticism of existing forms, and 
his insistent postulation of new principles of 
government. At the same time he took no 
part in the immediate quarrels of the Assem- 
bly, nor in its practical labors. He " lived 
in ideas rather than in their application," and 
was in truth incapable of sharing in the popu- 
lar excitement and enthusiasm of 1789. This 
aloofness of temperament, combined with a 
recognized sincerity, both constantly displayed 
in the Assembly and at the Jacobin Club, 
served in time to give him a far-reaching 
influence. In popular estimation he personi- 
fied those principles which the radical revolu- 
tionists were struggling to realize. But with 
the events of the 10th of August, the people, 
whose rights Robespierre had been preaching, 
actually acquired power, and a change of role 
was imperative. Obliged to abandon obstruct- 
ive criticism, his true forte, he entered upon 
a period of constructive activity, in which he 
forfeited both the source of his popularity and 
his political independence. Though not the 
coward he has frequently been pictured, he 
was never a leader in action, nor strong in 
times of crisis. He unconsciously undermined 
his own influence by yielding principles to 
political necessity or to personal ambition. 
In the trial of the King, his logic became 
sophistry; in the attack upon the Girondists 
he exhibited none but the politician's tactics. 
Yet with the overthrow of the Girondists the 
time finally arrived when Robespierre's ideals 
were to be put in execution, when his essays 
were to become codes. 

This interpretation of Robespierre by Mr. 
Belloc, as just summarized, does not differ 
greatly from that commonly given. It is with 
the period following Robespierre's entrance 
into the Committee of Public Safety that the 
biography diverges from the beaten track. He 
joined the Committee, says Mr. Belloc, not 
reluctantly, but of set purpose. He passed 
from the realm of abstract theory to that of 
practical politics. More and more he sacrificed 
principles to the gratification of personal am- 
bition, and he knew himself to have deserted 
his ideals. Opposed in theory to the system of 
the Terror, he yet submitted to it to retain his 



leadership in Paris, while his occasional resist- 
ance to that system is explained as the result 
of a desire to exhibit his authority. Finally 
he was tempted, — tempted by the vision of 
despotic authority, only transparently masked 
by a pretense of moderating the Terror ; and 
he knew his temptation, yet yielded. Such an 
analysis denies to Robespierre the excuse of 
self-deception : an extreme view, yet one ably 
argued. It seems reasonable also to the reader, 
and thus is evidence of the skill with which 
the author has combined his materials. It can- 
not be accepted as conclusive, simply because 
no dictum on Robespierre is conclusive. As 
Mr. Belloc himself states, " in every attempt 
to explain the man, one must omit the back- 
ground." In a greater degree than with any 
other man of the revolutionary era, contempo- 
rary events fail to illuminate his character. The 
study of Robespierre is the study of " a mind 
isolated and feeding inwardly upon itself." 
In his preface Mr. Belloc writes : 
" Nothing would be easier than to make a drama of 
the life of Robespierre, were one content to neglect the 
exactitude of historical record, Ou the other hand, 
nothing would be easier . . . than to write down a 
voluminous chronicle in which the self contradictions 
should be stated, but not explained, and in which all 
the sequence of the great story and all its poignancy 
should be neglected." 

Having denied himself the " easier task," Mr. 
Belloc undertook to steer the much more diffi- 
cult middle course, and explain the man. To 
do this successfully and present to the public 
a study which altogether escapes the imputation 
of the dry-as-dust accounts on the one hand, 
and also of the luridly painted theatrical effects 
on the other, has been Mr. Belloc's work. And 
it is no small praise to say that his explanation 
of Robespierre, while not forfeiting its claim 
to an honorable place among historical studies, 
has also much of the charm and style and 
finish which should win recognition for it in a 
wider field. E. D. Adams. 



America in the Far East.* 



Passing over the matter of racial bias, and 
of the insuperable British belief in the right 
of Anglo-Saxon nations to subjugate and domi- 
nate weaker peoples, it may be said that few 
students of contemporary diplomacy are better 
qualified to speak of the events that are so 
rapidly transforming the Orient and opening 
for us a new chapter in the history of the

world than Mr, Archibald R. Colquhoun, author 
of "The Mastery of the Pacific." Long a 
resident and traveller in foreign lands, he has 
enjoyed rare opportunities for observing the 
peoples of the Far East and noting such social 
and political institutions as are calculated to 
throw light on their racial traits as well as on 
their capacity for self-government. Former 
deputy commissioner of Burma and admin- 
istrator of Mashonaland, he was for several 
years a special correspondent of the London 
" Times " in the Orient, — positions that gave 
him access to sources of information seldom 
exploited by Europeans. Notwithstanding the 
fact that he has already published some of 
these impressions in former volumes which 
have not only aroused wide interest but won 
for him special recognition from the Royal 
Geographical Society, the present book is in 
every sense a new and original production. 
Its dominant idea appears to be that the Pacific 
is to become the highway for the commerce of 
the world, and hence the arena for the inter- 
national rivalries of the dawning century. Mr. 
Colquhoun's style is at once clear and graphic, 
while his description of Asiatic conditions and 
possibilities is both thorough and comprehen- 
sive. The numerous sketches and photographs, 
which add so much to the interest and value of 
the book, were made by Mrs. Colquhoun, the 
constant companion of her husband throughout 
his journeys. There are also several good 
maps and a copious index. 

The introductory pages of the volume are 
devoted to the history of the Pacific and of the 
various races that have made their homes along 
its coasts and in its countless islands ; while 
succeeding chapters give a more or less com- 
prehensive account of the three chief colonial 
interests in the Orient, — namely, those of the 
United States, Great Britain, and Holland, — 
and of the empire of Japan, with its colony of 
Formosa. Then follows a glance at the interests 
of other Powers in Asiatic waters, — the first 
place being assigned to Germany and France, 
not only on account of their insular possessions, 
but also by reason of their even more extensive 
interests on the mainland. Finally comes a 
rough survey of the possessions of China and 
Russia ; and the book concludes with a brief 
presentation of Mr. Colquhoun's views regard- 
ing the probable trend of future events in the 
Far East. Convinced that the struggle for 
supremacy must inevitably be settled by force, 
and therefore fought out by Russia and Japan 
because of their proximity to bases of supplies, 



he is disposed to believe that the impending 
conflict, though perhaps a bloodless one, is to 
be shifted to an ocean sphere. Hence the 
Mastery of the Pacific is to be decided by the 
Great Sea Powers. 

American readers will naturally turn with 
keenest interest to those pages of Mr. Colqu- 
houn's work which set forth our own interests 
in the Pacific. Thoroughly familiar with the 
political situation both in this country and in 
the Philippines, he balances the varying forces 
that are thrusting us further and further into 
the vortex of international passions, and draws 
conclusions that ought to receive the careful 
attention of our statesmen as well as of all 
citizens who can rise above party and creed. 
To many readers Mr. Colquhoun's remarks 
concerning the religion of the Filipino will 
come in the nature of a revelation. " His 
Christianity," the author declares, " is a thing 
about which his best friends disagree. Some 
say it is deep and sincere, others that it is a 
mere matter of outward show and superstition. 
One of themselves makes the distinction that 
it is not 80 much religious as fanatical." While 
convinced that we are only on the threshold, so 
to speak, of the difficulties that await us in the 
Far East, Mr. Colquhoun thinks that, in spite 
of many mistakes, we have already accom- 
plished a great deal. And, like most other 
Englishmen who so complacently view our un- 
joyous outing in the Pacific, he extols the sa- 
lubrity of the atmosphere, the picturesqueness 
of the scenery, and counsels us to keep up our 
present diet and exercise. Should we cease 
finding game in the Philippines, there is always 
the prospect of a bear-hunt in India. He de- 
plores the employment of colored troops in 
subjugating the native population, urges the 
adoption of an efficient plan of civil service, 
and expresses the hope that our government 
will not be hostile either to the institutions of 
the islanders or to the capital of Europeans. 
Mr. Colquhoun observes that what is now 
wanted is, " not further statements as to the 
actual number of pagans in certain districts, 
or the percentage of immorality among the 
Friars, but experience and judgment in dealing 
with matters as they stand at present. All the 
information which can be had by cross-examin- 
ing untruthful witnesses has been already col- 
lected, and the bones of the discussion are 
picked bare." In other words, America must 
make up her mind as to her future relations to 
the Archipelago and then " put her faith in the 
men who have already devoted so much of their

time to the problem." To send another com- 
mission would, in his opinion, merely result in 
increasing the number of smatterers. Judge 
Taft he regards as being thoroughly capable 
of facing the situation, provided he is supported 
at home. Mr. Colquhoun believes that our 
ideal policy in the Philippines would have been 
a temporary military occupation followed by a 
gradually-developed civil administration ; but 
since, out of deference to public opinion in the 
United States, a system of quasi-independence 
has been inaugurated, he throws out the char- 
acteristic suggestion that our government ought 
to " interfere as little as possible with the cus- 
toms, prejudices, and religion of the Filipinos, 
and to keep a tight hold." 

Of the various rival powers in the Far East, 
the United States, according to Mr. Colquhoun, 
will be the dominant factor in the Mastery of 
the Pacific ; and this opinion is based in large 
measure on our vast resources and fast-increas- 
ing population. But he points out very forcibly, 
in his concluding paragraphs, that in thus em- 
barking on this new phase of her career our 
country must be prepared to make certain sac- 
rifices as well as to remodel not a few of her 
time-honored institutions. In other words, 
" there can be no rest, no pause, in the march 
of a great empire; it must advance or decay, 
— history has made that plain."

Briefs on New Books. 



The completion of Mr. L. H. Bailey's 
gr^iiopedZ S^^^^ " Cyclopedia of American Hor- 
ticulture " (Macmillan) deserves 
special notice. At first the work was planned to 
be a three-volume cyclopedia, but before the first 
volume was half written it was found that four vol- 
umes would be necessary. As Professor Bailey 
says, " the article Asparagics is the first that began 
to feel the fuller and larger treatment." The editor 
expresses the hope that this cyclopedia will never 
be revised, since its purpose is to make a record of 
North American horticulture as it exists at the 
opening of the twentieth century. It is expected 
that subsequent progress will be recorded in a series 
of supplements, with cumulative index, the manu- 
script for the first two of which is already prepared. 
This work has already been somewhat fully re- 
viewed in The Dial, but its important features as 
a whole, that serve to distinguish it from other 
works of the same class, may be re-stated briefly : 
It represents a living horticulture, rather than a 
compilation of species that chance to have been de. 
scribed or pictured in other cyclopedias or in peri. 



odical publications. In it are found only those 
species known to be actually in cultivation in this 
country at the time of publication. The second 
feature is that the species are compared and con- 
trasted as well as described. No cyclopedia has 
such keys to enable the reader to name the species 
he has in hand. A third feature is that the leading 
articles are all signed. One can tell the source of 
information ; and while the great number of con- 
tributors, reaching more than 450, has resulted in 
a somewhat heterogeneous work, there is a person- 
ality in the articles, representing as they do a wide 
range of experience and attainment, that is far more 
satisfactory than the cnt-and-trimmed style of the 
ordinary cyclopedia. The fourth feature of the 
book is that it is primarily a cyclopedia of horti- 
culture rather than of gardening ; and one more 
worthy of mention is that plants are presented as 
living and growing things that are still undergoing 
evolution. This has introduced the historical method 
of treatment ; and although the subject is a vast 
one for detailed presentation, the intelligent reader 
feels the drift of an evolutionary motive. Aside 
from these general features, an entirely new set of 
excellent horticultural pictures, the biographies of 
persons who have had an important influence upon 
American horticulture, the geographical and his- 
torical subjects, the special attention given to trop- 
ical and sub-tropical plants, the unusual number of 
citations to literature, are all worthy of commen- 
dation. Some of the interesting statistics of the 
work may be mentioned. There are 4357 entries 
or articles, including cross-references ; the number 
of genera described is 2225 ; the number of species 
fully described is 8793, of which 2419 are native 
to North America north of Mexico. Writing on 
the cyclopedia was begun in January, 1899, a year 
having then been spent in making indexes and col- 
lecting data. The proof of the letter Z was received 
December 31, 1901. In dismissing the work, the 
editor, in a very characteristic vein, writes as fol- 
lows : " Hundreds of books had become familiar 
friends. We would never see them all together 
again. Like a child, the cyclopedia had grown. 
Like the mature youth, it had left us. It was no 
longer ours." 

Theories 0/ ^*'' *^* ^' Dabney is the latest of 

the noiafion of theorists regarding the notation of 
English verse. English verse, and, like his prede- 
cessors, he believes he has solved the multiform 
problem it presents in " The Musical Basis of 
Verse, a Scientific Study of the Principles of Poetic 
Composition" (Longmans). All English poetry, 
the book observes, follows in detail the laws of 
musical composition, and may be noted musically 
in either two-four or three-four time. Being purely 
a question of stressed syllables regularly recurring, 
with either one or two unstressed syllables inter- 
vening, the division can be made with exactitude, 
all of the measures variously known as iambic, 
trochaic, or spondaic falling into the two-four bar,

and those either dactylic, amphibrachic, or ana- 
paestic into the three-four. The author further 
reduces all forms of English metre to three classes 
or manners: (1), "Strict," in which all the lines 
begin uniformly with the anacrusis, which will 
include iambs, anapaests, and amphibrachs; (2), 
those " with direct attack," without the anacrusis, 
comprising dactyls and trochees; and (3), "Free," 
in which the poet uses lines with or without the 
anacrusis. As in the case of his predecessors in 
this field, Mr. Dabney finds it necessary to accuse 
poets of eminence of lack of ear for writing verses 
which do not fall within his scheme, — Words- 
worth and Emerson among others. The question 
of extra syllables is met by putting in extra notes — 
not grace notes, either — as in the case of Milton's 
" Wallowing unwieldy, enormous in their gait," 
where the first bar has four notes and the second 
three. It is Sidney Lanier's method carried to its 
logical conclusion ; but it does not bring conviction 
in its train. There is a law, exceedingly complex 
in its statement, which governs English heroic 
verse. It implies not merely stresses in due place, 
but stresses out of place, the use of long syllables to 
produce such effects, the various placings of the 
caesura, and the use of rhetorical pauses for this 
purpose. It also implies elisions, the uses of phrases 
as long words, and all the delicate shades of stress 
which long words and phrases so used necessitate. 
Its infinite varieties cannot be stated in terms of 
the metronome, as Mr. Dabney insists ; and he 
leaves the problem quite as complicated as he finds 
it. To the classicist, indeed, his book will seem 
like the reduction of Lanier's work to an absurdity. 

The two latest issues of that excel- 

f/ifr/JoTn.. ;«^* g'-^"? °; ^^^ «^e« «* .^^^^ who 

have played a large part m Amer- 
ican history, called the " Riverside Biographical 
Series " (Houghton), are of value and interest, 
since they are not only good pieces of work, but 
treat of men whose lives are among ordinary 
readers largely a matter of tradition. Mr. William 
Garrott Brown has given the life-story of Stephen 
Arnold Douglas with a completeness that seems 
remarkable until one remembers the meteoric 
brevity of that astonishing career and the over- 
shadowing importance of the one great question that 
roused the passion and filled the attention of the 
country during the decade before the Civil War. 
Few parallels can be found to the astonishing rise 
to prominence of this man whose body was so small 
but whose ambition was so colossal. There was 
no situation that he did not dominate at once, 
whether in frontier Illinois or at the capital of the 
nation, until he found himself confronted by the 
aroused moral sense of the North. Then his essen- 
tial weakness was manifested. Wholly unlike Lin- 
coln, his beaten rival all through life up to this 
time, he lacked in moral sensibility. He could not 
measure this new force, because he could not 
understand it. So he failed of the presidency, the 



goal of his ambition ; and when he died, at forty- 
eight, he had been pushed to one side by his less 
brilliant but far greater rival. The volume will 
appeal most to those who are already familiar with 
the history of Douglas's time. — The other volume 
is a life of Samuel de Champlain, by Mr. Henry D. 
Sedgwick, Jr. Here, too, one purpose dominated 
the life of the subject, so that, although the life's 
activity extended over nearly half a century, it can 
be adequately presented in a small compass. The 
author has shown his hero as a statesman and a 
prudent leader of men, as well as a daring explorer. 
His final word is this : " Champlain was very noble 
in public and private life, simple, just, honorable, 
and kind, with a tenderness toward the weak, and 
a steadfast, patient loyalty in trouble, that with his 
* insuppressive mettle ' make him one of the worth- 
iest, if not the worthiest, man in the early history 
of North America." 



Mediceval 
ivory carvings. 



The second volume in the series of 
"Handbooks of Great Craftsmen" 
(Macmillan) is curiously misnamed 
" The Ivory Workers of the Middle Ages," and is 
certainly misplaced in a series of books having to 
do with the great craftsmen. The human interest 
is conspicuously lacking. The author, Mr. A. M. 
Cust, manages to avoid giving any information 
whatever regarding ivory workers. Tuotilo, the 
monk of St. Gall, and a reputed hero of the craft 
{circa 900 A.D.), is mentioned only for the pur- 
pose of denying that he was an eminent craftsman 
in ivory. If it be true, as other monographs upon 
ivory carving state, that Albrecht Durer, Michel 
Angelo, Benvenuto Cellini, and many other artists 
and many European princes of the Middle Ages, 
followed the " beautiful craft," and furnished 
specimens of their workmanship in ivory to enrich 
the museums of the art capitals of Europe, no men- 
tion thereof is made in this book. Some informa- 
tion it gives regarding the art of ivory carving in 
its relation to sculpture, and it seeks to show the 
continuity of this art from the time of the Cave 
Dwellers down through the various periods into 
which the history of art is divided, and that it 
prospered at times when the sculptor's art declined 
and when monumental sculpture was almost com- 
pletely suspended. All this is interesting; but the 
photographic reproductions by which the book is 
illustrated do not exhibit the anonymous mediaeval 
carvers as accurate interpreters of the human form, 
nor their skill as superior to that of the modern 
ivory workers. Nor are the pictures calculated to 
inspire the readers of the book with a very deep 
interest in the art of ivory carving.

THE DIAL 



[May 16, 



topics, touching the Old and New Testaments, Rab- 
binical lore, and Semitic history. They are up-to- 
date discussions, and reflect the spirit of investiga- 
tion that properly has its abode in such an institu- 
tion as Yale. The first article, by Professor E. 
L. Curtis, is a study of the tribes of Israel, in the 
light of the latest hypotheses put forth by a num- 
ber of Old Testament scholars, especially in Europe. 
The impression produced on the reader by a careful 
perusal of this article is that we are in danger of 
falling into a habit of employing fanciful and arbi- 
trary methods in the interpretation of ancient ori- 
ental literature. There is no limit to the possibilities 
of such imaginary explanations as he gives of the 
personages of the Old Testament. The growth of 
Israelitish law is the theme of the second article. 
As in much of the current discussions of that sub- 
ject, the authors. Professors Kent and Sanders, 
present an argument for the chief growth of the 
law late in Hebrew history — in post-exilic times. 
To a layman in the subject, their method of pre- 
sentation is orderly, consecutive, logical, but rather 
too much wedded to a theory that underlies the 
whole scheme to carry conviction. Professor F. 
C. Porter contributes the third article on " Yetser 
Hara," " the evil inclination," or " imagination " in 
the Old Testament, rabbinical literature, etc. This 
is a valuable addition to our knowledge of this 
important Hebrew term. " The Significance of the 
Resurrection," by Professor Moulton, " Stephen's 
Speech," by Professor Bacon, and " The Moham- 
medan Conquest of Egypt and North Africa (643- 
705 A. D.)," by Professor Torrey, are the con- 
cluding scholarly contributions to this valuable 
bicentennial volume of Yale University. 

A few appreciative sketches on mu- 
interesting gj^g^i subiects, written by Mr. Filson 

musical estays. •' , i i • i i -i 

Young, have been published under 
the title of " Mastersingers " (imported by Charles 
Scribner's Sons). While there has been no effort 
to deliver a critical judgment upon the music and 
musicians written about, the author has penned a 
truthful record of the effect that certain works, 
differing widely one from the other, produce on a 
single mind. In three successive chapters we are 
given a critical analysis of " Bach's Organ Fugues," 
" Mozart's Requiem," and " Tschaikowsky's Sixth 
Symphony." To those who are familiar with these 
works, and yet have but a slight knowledge of the 
meaning of all the leading motives that are inter- 
woven into textures of inexpressible beauty, the 
author's treatment of the subjects has a pictorial 
suggestiveness that enables one to dispense with a 
thorough understanding of the actual music. Stu- 
dents of music will appreciate the manner in which 
certain musical ideas have been revealed, — for the 
fruitless search after a single pregnant and striking 
musical idea in a forest of contrapuntal solfeggios 
and roulades is certainly not a pleasurable exercise 
of mental ingenuity. Another interesting chv^ter 
in the book is devoted to Charles Villiers Stanford. 



No man better deserves a place 
ll'ofllZ'' ^"^'^"g "American Men of Energy" 

than does General Israel Putnam, a 
life of whom by William Farrand Livingston has 
been added by the Messrs. Putnam to the brief 
series of biographies bearing that name. The en- 
ergy of "Old Put" needed not to be brought to 
mind, for too many legends concerning the old hero 
are still afloat. But the volume is needed to cor- 
rect what may be a current misapprehension, too 
likely to arise in such cases, that there was not 
behind the marvellous energy and daring the more 
solid qualities of ability and character. While the 
facts given are out of historical perspective, as in 
most biographies, and General Putnam's part is 
made almost the central one in the war, after all 
allowances are made one cannot but conclude that 
he was really an able general and a broad-minded 
statesman in his political views. That Washington 
made him his right-hand man during the early 
years of the Revolution, would almost settle the 
matter. The earlier part of the story, recounting 
the services of the hero as scout and officer in the 
French and Indian War, is a constant succession of 
venturesome and almost foolhardy deeds ; but the 
reader feels throughout that there are shrewdness 
and good sense behind the daring exploits. 

Men and event* " The Irish question," as Lord Rose- 
in 18th-century bery once happily remarked, " has 
Ireland. never passed into history because it 

has never passed out of politics." Mr. C. Litton 
Falkiner quotes this observation in the preface to 
his " Studies in Irish History and Biography " 
(Longmans), and adds that he cannot hope to 
escape criticism from the point of view of Irish 
politics. His chapters are devoted mainly to 
eighteenth-century characters, and he has aimed to 
exhaust all available sources of information. Most 
of these studies have already seen the light in the 
" Edinburgh," the " Quarterly," and other reviews 
and magazines, and one is expanded from a short 
article contributed to the " Dictionary of National 
Biography." Grattan, Clare, Castlereagh, Plunket, 
Thomas Steele, Sir Boyle Roche, and the Earl- 
Bishop of Derry claim each a chapter, while the 
last third of the volume is devoted to an account 
of the French invasion of Ireland. The reputed 
father of the Irish bull is, of course, the most 
diverting character in the book, and one regrets 
that more space could not have been allowed him. 
Scholarly treatment and fairness of tone make this 
collection of Irish studies by an Irishman a work 
of more than passing interest. 



The love-letters 
of Napoleon. 



" Napoleon's Letters to Josephine, 
1796-1813" (Button), translated 
and edited by Mr. H. F. Hall, serve, 
with the aid of copious notes, wide margins, and 
thick paper, to make up a presentable volume. The 
letters for the. period of the first Italian campaign 
depict the impassioned lover, and are of interest

in illustrating Napoleon's romantic temperament in 
early manhood. Those of 1806-7, at the time of 
the war with Prussia and Russia, indicate a thought- 
ful interest in keeping Josephine informed of the 
progress of the campaign, but are brief and hur- 
ried. In all save the first period, any one of these 
so-called letters might easily be reproduced upon a 
modern postal card, and few have any inherent 
personal interest. They are largely mere abbrevi- 
ated records of events, accompanying a perennial 
injunction to Josephine to be *' contented and 
happy." Mr. Hall has fulfilled the duties of an 
editor very acceptably, placing before each letter a 
statement of the leading contemporary events, while 
his arrangement is logical, and his translation 
happy. This presentation enhances such interest 
as the letters may possess. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Notes. 



The first four issues of " The Unit Library " have 
reached our table. This library is to consist of reprints 
of standard literature, published at a low price, which 
is reckoned upon the basis of ^d, for every "unit" of 
twenty-five pages. Another penny is added for a paper 
cover, and something more for cloth and leather bind- 
ings. The books now published are " The Vicar 
of Wakefield" (9 units), "A Sentimental Journey" 
(6 units), " The Origin of Species " (20 units), and 
Emerson's " English Traits " (8 units) . The editions 
are unabridged. This enterprise bids fair to do for 
English readers what has been done so successfully 
in the case of German readers by the " Universal- 
Bibliothek " of Phillip Reclam, from which the idea 
has evidently been borrowed. 

We have received from the Atlanta University Press 
an interesting discussion of " The Negro Common 
School," being a report of a social study made under 
the direction of the University, and now edited by Dr. 
W. E. Burghardt Du Bois. These studies of the 
negro problem which are being made with so much 
intelligence by Atlanta University are of great socio- 
logical and educational value, and deserve to be widely 
examined. Perhaps the most striking showing made 
by the present pamphlet is that for the last thirty 
years the negroes of the former slave states have paid 
for their own schools (contrary to the usual idea), and 
that the negroes of the whole country have contributed 
during the past generation no less than forty millions 
of dollars for the education of their children. 

An extra number of the " Johns Hopkins University 
Studies in Historical and Political Science " is made up 
of tributes to the late Herbert B. Adams. The chief 
contributions are by Messrs. J. M. Vincent, Richard T. 
Ely, Daniel C. Gilman, and Burr J. Ramage. The 
greater part of the volume is devoted to a bibliography 
of the work done. by men connected with the depart- 
ment of History, Politics, and Economics during its 
first quarter-century. The showing made is truly im- 
posing, and helps us to understand what the Johns 
Hopkins influence has done for American scholarship. 
It has been a fertilizing and fructifying influence 
throughout the whole country, and has amply justified 
the far-sighted wisdom of its late President. 



« Samuel I. II.," edited by Mr. James Sime, and 
" Deuteronomy," edited by Mr. G. Wilkins, are two 
volumes of the «* Temple Bible," published by the J. B. 
Lippincott Co. 

"Julius Caesar," with an introduction and notes by 
Mr. Michael Macmillan, is the latest volume of the 
library edition of Shakespeare now in course of publi- 
cation by the Bowen-Merrill Co. 

Two volumes of " Guy Fawkes," two of " Old St. 
Paul's," and one of " Star Chamber," are additions to 
the new " Windsor " edition of W. H. Ainsworth's nov- 
els, published by the J. B. Lippincott Co. 

« Four American Explorers," by Miss Nellie F. Kings- 
ley, is a new volume in a series of educational reading- 
books published by the Werner School Book Co. Lewis, 
Clark, Fremont, and Kane are the four men whose ex- 
ploits are chronicled in simple and interesting language. 

" The International Student's Atlas," prepared under 
the direction of Mr. J. G. Bartholomew, is imported 
by the Messrs. Scribner. It includes nearly a hundred 
pages of plates, and a comprehensive general index. It 
may be recommended as a strictly modern work at a 
moderate price. 

A translation of Alexander Glovatski's novel of an- 
cient Egypt, " The Pharaoh and the Priest," has been 
made by Mr. Jeremiah Curtin, and will be issued at an 
early date by Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. The same 
firm will also publish next month a new novel by Miss 
Mary Devereux, entitled " Lafitte of Louisiana." 

Mr. Clarence S. Darrow's collection of pleasant lit- 
erary papers, " A Persian Pearl, and Other Essays," 
first published in 1899, now reappears in a new edition 
bearing the imprint of Mr. C. L. Ricketts, Chicago. In 
mechanical form the volume is a great improvement 
over the original Roycroft edition, and is altogether a 
good example of artistic but inexpensive bookmaking. 

" Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines " is one of the 
frothiest of Mr, Clyde Fitch's frothy dramatic efforts. 
Its present publication in book form, with illustrations 
(including a portrait of Miss Ethel Barrymore), will 
doubtless be welcome to those who have seen the play 
and wish for a permanent souvenir of their hour of 
amusement. The book comes from Messrs. Doubleday, 
Page & Co. 

" Grieb's German Dictionary " has long been a stan- 
dard work, and we welcome the publication of the new 
edition (the tenth), re-arranged, revised, and enlarged 
under the editorship of Dr. Arnold Schroer of Freiburg 
i. B. The English-German section is the only one now 
published, and makes a volume of 1358 pages. The 
Oxford University Press (Mr. Henry Frowde) supplies 
the English and American market with this work. 

The University of Chicago Press send us an acting 
edition of Ben Jonson's " The Case is Altered," which 
is to be produced by students of the University on the 
seventeenth of this month. As the first production in 
Chicago of an Elizabethan play under Elizabethan con- 
ditions, the occasion promises to be of much interest. 
At the same time, we receive from Messrs. Paul Elder 
& Morgan Shepard, San Francisco, a translation of the 
" Antigone " of Sophocles, prepared in connection with 
the recent performance of the play (in Greek) under 
the Stanford auspices. This translation follows Pro- 
fessor Jebb's text in most matters, and is the work of 
Professors H. R. Fairclough and A. T. Murray.

A Summer Trip not 
Surpassed on the Continent. 

The trip to Salt Lake City, or to the Pacific coast 
via that point over the Denver & Rio Grande and 
the Rio Grande Western is the most beautiful in 
America. No European trip of equal length can 
compare with it in grandeur of scenery or wealth 
of novel interest. Then Salt Lake City itself is 
a most quaint and picturesque place and well 
worth the journey. Its Mormon temple, taber- 
nacle, tithing oflSce and church institutions; its 
hot sulphur springs within the city limits; its 
delightful temperature, sunny climate and its 
Great Salt Lake — deader and denser than the 
Dead Sea in Palestine — are but a few features 
of Salt Lake City's countless attractions. There 
are parks, drives, canons and beautiful outlying 
mountain and lake resorts. Imagine, if you can, 
a bath in salt water a mile above sea level and 
in water in which the human body cannot sink. 
Inquire of your nearest ticket agent for low 
tourist rates to Salt Lake City, or write for 
information and copy of " Salt Lake City, the 
City of the Saints," to S. K. Hooper, general 
passenger agent, Denver, Colo.

SOME OF THE BEST SUMMER BOOKS 



Genial Social Satire. 

This story shows, in a delightfully witty and humorous vein, very 
cleverly drawn pictures of the life of an English girl in French so- 
ciety as compared with that of the much chaperoned French made- 
moiselle. It is really witty and amusing. 

AN ENGLISH GIRL IN PARIS

pared with our freedom-loving girl. 



Another ''Elizabeth" Book.

The Brooklyn Eagle writes: 

" A brilliant, very entertaining novel, full of lively conversation,

once in a way, everything comes out all right : Madge's secret re- 
mains conveniently buried forever — and that is how it happens in 
real life more frequently than not." 



A New Omar Khayyam. 

INDIA'S LOVE LYRICS 

Collected and Arranged by Laurence Hope. 
Decorative cover. 12mo. $1.50 net. 
The London Athenaeum writes: 

" Mr. Hope has caught admirably the dominant notes of 
this Indian love poetry, its delirious absorption in the in- 
stant, its out-of-door air, its melancholy. Slender brown 
limbs stir silently in the garden where flying foxes cross the 
moon."

Good Books for Warm Weather 
The Misdemeanors of Nancy 

By Eleanor Hoyt. With sixteen dainty pictures by Penrhyn Stanlaws. ;^i.50. 



*< Miss Hoyt's heroine is the most charm= 
ing creature in the world of fiction— which 
contains no more adorable little flirt than 
Miss Nancy." — Chicago Inter Ocean. 



" For real cleverness, wit, and spark- 
ling persiflage, • The Misdemeanors of 
Nancy ' has not had an equal." 

— Chicago Tribune. 



The Bookbuyer says : " Nancy, creature of epigrams and flirtations, is thoroughly alive. 
' Touring in Bohemia ' is by far the jolliest and truest study of ' Bohemia ' that we have had in 
a long time. No one else has shown quite such a rollicking sense of humor or quite such 
clearsightedness in picturing that queer quarter of the world." 



Thirty-first 
Thousand. 



The Battleground 



By Ellen Glasgow. 
Illustrated. ;^i.50. 



The New York Times Saturday Review says : " Miss Glasgow ranks with Mr. Page as a 
painter and an interpreter of the Old South — and her negroes are as perfect as Mr. Harris's. 
It has the rare charm of a most satisfactory heroine, one whom to know in real life would be a 
liberal education in womanly virtues. . . . Miss Glasgow has written a poetic tale of young 
love, . . . she has wonderfully well portrayed Southern society, . . . but as a story of the 
Civil War ' The Battleground'' stands alone." 



Thirty-third Thousand. 

The Leopard's Spots 

By Thomas Dixon, Jr. Illustrated, ;^i.50. 

A very strong presentation of existing conditions in 
the South, and the most illuminating work on the Re- 
construction Era which has ever appeared. It has been 
called " The most noteworthy book of recent years," 
and the commendations from both North and South 
have been very strong. 



The Coast of Freedom 

A 'virile tale of the ad^venturous times of Wm. Phips, 
the first ^^ self-made American.''^ 

By Adele Marie Shaw. 

" Of absorbing interest from the first chapter to the 
closing page." — Brooklyn Eagle. 

" Pictured with a vividness that has never been 
equalled." — Pittsburg Leader. 



Fifth Edition Now Ready. 

The Colonials 

A Romance of Boston at the Outbreak of the Re'volution. 

By Allen French. Decorated, ^1.50. 

" So strong, so symmetrical, so virile a work of

IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT 

TO BE PUBLISHED THIS FALL 

History of the Expedition of 
Captains Lewis and Clark 

1804-5-6 

NOTWITHSTANDING that in America few names are more familiar upon the tongue 
than Lewis and Clark, it is a singular fact that at the present moment a full and 
adequate account of what they did is almost unattainable. The complete journals of 
the explorers are still in manuscript. The pubhshed work of 18 14, abridged and 
adapted from the journals by the accomphshed Nicholas Biddle (though the name of 
another appears on the title-page as editor), has long been out of print. The frag- 
mentary accounts that preceded the Biddle edition have become very rare, as also the 
various foreign presentments, English, Dutch, German, and French. The noble 
reprint of the Biddle edition which appeared in 1893, prefaced, annotated, and supple- 
mented in every needful way by Dr. Elliott Coues, a work of great bulk and cost, has 
quite disappeared from the market. At the present moment whoever desires to own 
the story of Lewis and Clark must content himself with abridged compendia or 
unsatisfactory reprints, or pay high for copies, usually tattered and mildewed, in 
auction rooms and the stores of dealers in old books. 

The lack thus existing, felt now more and more as the centenary of the great ex- 
ploration draws near, Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. propose to make good. In the 
early Fall of 1902, there will appear over their imprint a beautifully printed edition of 
the Travels in handy form, at a popular price, which will be planned to fill all the 
requirements of libraries and private buyers, and thus become the standard edition of 
this great American classic. The text will be that of the Biddle edition, which must 
hold its place as the only account approaching adequacy. 

This new edition, then, will be a reprint of the Biddle text of 18 14 complete. Its 
bulk will not be increased by annotation, but it will be carefully supervised by Dr. 
James K. Hosmer, Librarian of the Minneapolis Pubhc Library, a well-known speciaHst 
in matters pertaining to Western history, the author of "A Short History of the Mis- 
sissippi Valley" and "A History of the Louisiana Purchase." Dr. Hosmer will 
prepare a careful analytic Index, a feature which the original edition lacked, and 
furnish an Introduction giving the events which led up to the great expedition, and 
the vast development that has flowed from it, in a way to make plain the profound 
significance of the achievement. Fac-similes of all the maps of the 18 14 edition will 
be given, together with the best extant portraits of the heroes of the enterprise. 

The edition will be in two square octavo volumes of over 500 pages each, printed 
from a new font of pica old style type, on an extra quality soft laid paper, with uncut 
edges.

ONE OF THE MOST DRAMATICALLY INTERESTING CHAR- 
acters of the history of the world and one of the most audacious 
schemes ever foisted upon a credulous nation, form the subjects of 
an unusually able and intensely interesting romance by Emerson 
Hough. 

=^ 

The title of the book will disclose both secrets. It is "The Mis- 
sissippi Bubble." 

The chief person is, of course, that intense figure of adventure 
and finance, John Law, of Lauriston, the man who was greater than 
kings, who made and unmade ministers, who conjured and threw 
away fortune after fortaue ; the man whose loves were Olympic, 
in quantity as well as in quality, whose repute was of all colors and, 
because of its electric brightness, is now almost mythical ; the man who 
drove half the old world crazy by the inflation of the new, and who, 
the bubble pricked, as lavishly returned half France to France and 
dropped from her sight forever, her curses ringing after him. 

Around this man's compelling comet of a life Mr. Hough has con- 
structed a romance that runs like a smooth road over great mountains 
and into deep valleys, a road that glitters with the gems of cleverness 
and brilliancy. 

It is surprising as well as pleasing in these days to find a novel 
written of other days compacted with the skill and graced by the 
style that the author of " The Mississippi Bubble " has achieved in 
this work. 

Law's brilliant financial genius, his devil's luck at cards, his fatal 
duel and consequent imprisonment and condemnation, his love and 
its ill-omened returns, his escape and flight to the new Western 
world, are told ably and effectively. 

The tide of historical opinion seems to have turned in favor of 
John Law's honesty and sincerity in the tremendous scheme which 
made him for a time the greatest millionaire among hundreds in his 
new adopted country — and Mr. Hough has made the most of it. 

To the end the story is told with a grace and delicacy as well as 
force and power that count for much.

Merrill Company.)

A NEW BOOK BY HERBERT SPENCER— TO BE HIS LAST 

FACTS AND COMMENTS 

By Herbert Spencer, author of "The Study of Sociology," "Education: Intellectual, Moral, Physical," 
etc. Uniform edition, 12mo, Cloth, $1.20 net (postage, 12 cts. additional). 
" Facta and Comments " will surely become the most popular of Mr. Spencer's works. The topics discussed are 
of general interest. At the hands of the unskilled they would be commonplace. From the analytical brain of a 
philosopher of the g^reatness of Herbert Spencer — a greatness that has extended over more than two generations — 
the subjects treated — any subject, in fact, — assumes a commanding importance. Such topics as "Americanisms," 
"Presence of Mind," " The Corruption of Music," "The Origin and Development of Music," "Estimates of Men," 
"State Education," etc., are invested with a life and actuality only possible under his stimulating treatment. With 
this book one finds a certain mellowness, a certain richness and fulness of Savor, that tend toward a feeling of closer 
personal relationship with the author. 



PRACTICAL FORESTRY

John Gifford, New York State College of For-

$1.20 net (postage, 12 cts. additional). 

The author explains simply and clearly the points of 
practical interest relating to soil, the growth of trees, their 
care, their relation to the water supply, the evils of whole- 
sale cutting, and the practical value of judicious selection. 
He places before the reader, in his sketch of forest dis- 
tribution, a most interesting picture of American wood- 
lands, which emphasizes the importance of a source not 
only of wealth, but of safety, much neglected in past 
years. Aside from the value of this book to special 
students and to those interested in the forests for eco- 
nomic reasons, the work is full of suggestions to owners 
of country homes and to all who care for nature.

THE NOVEL OF AMER ICAN HISTORY. 

Many are the Cassandra voices of to-day, fore- 
telling decadence and doom to the historical ro- 
mance. Each new novel of problem or tempera- 
ment is heralded as that long-awaited giant that 
shall overthrow the tenacious yet shrivelled race 
of historical romancers and hurl them from their 
vaunted throne in the reading-world. Meanwhile, 
undisturbed by the maledictions and prophesies, 
authors continue to write at maximum soul-sapping 
speed, and publishers continue to announce " fifty 
thousand copies sold ten days before publication." 

There are strong indications that reaction from 
this mercantile excess, this flamboyant advertise- 
ment of wares of the brain and fancy, must come 
as a relief to the judicial and scholarly reader. No 
one would deny that among the much-advertised 
and widely-read novels of the last five years a few 
have that intrinsic grasp and vital portraiture of 
mien and soul that will gain for them a place 
among the potent and representative books of the 
age. Despite such concessions, however, one must 
also admit that there are scores of volumes appear- 
ing annually, announced with glaring headlines, 
whose only claim to favor is in the dangerous and 
alluring appeal to overstrained imagination or neu- 
rotic passion. Such novels, fortunately, become 
literary comets, and their effect is soon obscured. 

Amid many inferior and sensational ventures, 
products of clever ambitions rather than sincere 
literary expression, the historical novel has yet 
reestablished itself upon the higher planes of fic- 
tion, and, through a few worthy volumes, has pro- 
claimed the sanative and energizing influence of 
this form of fiction, until it has reached a stead- 
fast response unrivalled since the days of Scott 
and Dumas. Whatever may be the decrease in the 
astounding sales of historical fiction during the 
next few years, whatever may become the next 
dominant literary fashion, it is safe to affirm that 
the historical novel, which has sincere purpose and 
literary power, has again attained a sure rank in 
contemporary literature. Previous to the last half 
decade, this literary type had endured disfavor for 
more than a quarter- century. After the works of 
Scott, Bulwer, and Cooper, the historical fiction, 
with few exceptions, was poorly executed and little 
read. In 1889, Mr. William Sharp, in a criticism 
upon one of the exceptional novels of this class, 
Hardy's " Passe Rose," admitted its skilful work- 
manship, but added, " The historical novel is at low 
ebb." He naade the prediction that this desuetude 
was permanent, and that neither scholars nor un- 
cultured readers had further need of this "hybrid'* 
form. And yet the need and response came as a 
healthful reaction from novels of extreme morbid

realism, or elemental local tales, whose simplicity 
at first pleased, then satiated, the reading world. 
A demand was created for more virile imaginative 
forms, and, in revival, appeared the novel of action, 
with two distinct literary expressions, — first, the 
novel of contemporaneous work and heroism, 
exampled by Mr. Kipling, Mr. Hopkinson Smith, or 
Miss French; and second, thehistorical romance that 
has regatablished its rightful claim. 

In no country has this form of romance met 
with more extravagant and long-lived favor than 
in America. Moreover, while old-world scenes in 
new panoramas have commanded ready sale, while 
Stevenson and Weyman, Galdos and Sienkiewicz, 
have been favorites, while the daring and zest of 
such a story as " The Helmet of Navarre " has 
received passing plaudits, yet the primal interest 
has centred about romances of national history. 
Though occasional critics attributed the new 
patriotism in literature to the war with Spain, yet 
its manifestation preceded this national event and 
has a more logical and sequential growth. It is 
akin to the changes in moods and tenets of life 
and letters during the last century. The parity of 
realism and picturesqueness is typical of the pres- 
ent age and has found special illustration in history 
and fiction. While readers make adroit synthesis 
of cause and result, while they trace the philosophy 
of great world-movements, they no longer welcome 
detailed philosophical methods by historians or fic- 
tionists. Buckle and Hallam are still classic, but 
the scenic historians, Carlyle and Froude, Fiske 
and Parkman, represent the present-day attitude 
toward the past. Our democratic age has no de- 
sire to see characters '' strut across the stage," or 
"step out from history's pages"; we are anxious 
to know the true man, stripped of his insignia. 
Perhaps our characteristic unreserve, which often 
borders on irreverence, has never been so well ex- 
pressed as in the semi-satirical lines of Halleck, 
descriptive of the early democratic traits of his 
countrymen who 

" Would shake hands with a king upon his throne, 
And think it kindness to His Majesty." 

The historical romancer is confronted by a seri- 
ous problem in portraiture of historical characters ; 
in many of the more recent and most artistic novels, 
as in the best work of Scott and Cooper, the lead- 
ing historical persons are in the background, not 
before the constant glare of the foot-lights. The 
more prominent characters in the story are ficti- 
tious or lesser-known to history. The skilful intro- 
duction of real historical heroes in minor rdles is a 
strong and safe method of emphasizing the atmos- 
phere. To make this scenic quality vivid, to reveal 
a creative and, at the same time, a relevant im- 
agination, constitute the essential aims of the his- 
torical novel. The reader may easily gauge the 
writer's scholarship by his success in attaining a 
true pictorial atmosphere. Droll anachronisms are 
found in some of the most popular fiction. To 



carelessly mingle history and fiction, in the setting 
of the story, is dangerous ; the reader of such 
stories, found among the most popular works of 
Scott and Bulwer no less than later writers, often 
carries through life delusions on important events 
and periods of history. 

Some recent novels and dramas of American his- 
tory have done gross injustice to real persons and 
scenes chosen for reproduction. To apotheosize 
Aaron Burr or villainize Israel Putnam, to scoff at 
Franklin's services for our country at the court of 
France or to bestow immortal youth upon Barbara 
Freitchie, — such perversions of facts perjure the 
historian and weaken the romancer. Again, many 
authors fail to adapt their diction to the colloquialisms 
of the times. There is a ludicrous aspect to a popular 
tale of the Revolution couched in the ultra-journalistic 
phrases of to-day, with references to prospective 
" sky-scrapers " and interchange of debonair club- 
life greetings. With many good qualities and evi- 
dence of wide reading, the gifted author of " A 
Son of the Old Dominion " loses the effect of her 
atmosphere when, in a thrilling narrative of Indian 
strife, she pauses suddenly and declares that these 
events " are all recorded in history," or, with yet 
greater offense, quotes directly from history, 
wholly destroying the illusion of her background. 
Such flaws suggest the substitution of the historian 
for the novelist ; the historian may study his events, 
the novelist must assimilate his studies and then 
portray. Thackeray and Charles Reade in the past, 
Mr. James Lane Allen, Mr. Thomas Nelson Page, 
and Miss Murfree in the present, excel in almost 
perfect reproduction, even incarnation, of chosen 
periods ; and these results are often gained without 
the introduction of familiar historical persons. 

A wide sympathy with the world's successive 
cycles, but a concentrated study of a particular 
period, characterize the best novelists of history. 
James, Ainsworth, Miss Muhlbach, of the past, have 
many kinsmen among current American romancers. 
They show versatility and marvellous industry, but 
such incomplete and inchoate panoramas will soon 
be forgotten as literature. Some of the honored 
names in historical fiction have produced only one 
or two novels. " Callista," " John Inglesant," " In 
His Name," are types of such exceptional and 
vital work. This last title suggests one of the 
earlier novels of American history whose favor has 
never been submerged. An English magazine of 
recent date mentioned this as " the best Ameri- 
can historical novel." In brief retrospect one may 
recall other early fiction of American history that 
has merited its immortality amid diverse literary 
fashions and vacillating standards of criticism. If 
Cooper often wearies with his prolix diction and 
his careless structure, he created two worthy novels 
of distinctive and thrilling action in " The Spy " 
and " The Last of the Mohicans," and thereby pro- 
claimed himself the pioneer romancer of American 
forests and frontier battle-lines. Amid the sen-

sational and imitative work of Paulding, Simms, 
Cooke, and Mrs. Childs, on historical themes, — 
volumes seldom opened today, — Irving has kept 
a perennial charm for old and young, and his 
genial, leisurely tales, with American history and 
legend for motives, have never been more honored 
and loved than they are in the new century. 
Lowell gave warm praise to a novel of American 
history that has lost, through some mischance, its 
merited reading. Sylvester Judd's " Margaret " 
cannot be surpassed as a vital portrayal of New 
England life at the meeting of the eighteenth and 
nineteenth centuries. It is essentially a story of 
analysis rather than of action, — a crude yet in- 
tensive mingling of realism and ideality. With the 
graphic recollections of musters, camp-meetings, 
huskings, and village schools of the period is inter- 
woven a story of deep soul-searching power. In a 
letter from Froude to Thoreau, after the latter's 
first volume, " A Week," had reached him, the 
English historian said : *^ In your book, and in 
one other from your side of the Atlantic, — ' Mar- 
garet ', — I see hope for the coming world." 

Hawthorne painted an unrivalled atmosphere of 
colonial Massachusetts, and, in wonder at his subtle, 
psychological magic of analysis, one must not for- 
get his faithful portrayal of early types and cus- 
toms. Decades ago the western pioneer lands were 
photographed in the fiction of Bret Harte, Edward 
Eggleston, and Miss Woolson. The strong realism 
of these stories, often fraught with actual experience, 
has given them rank both as novels of history and 
narratives of manners. It may be questioned if 
any historical novelist has revealed greater pic- 
torial vigor than Edwin Bynner in " Agnes Sur- 
riage " and " The Begum's Daughter." Like the 
true artist in fiction, Mr. Bynner chose a small 
dramatic episode about which he could cluster a few 
strong landmarks and types. Mr. Cable has 
immortalized the architecture and manners and 
speech of Creole New Orleans of the past and 
present, and to one reader, at least, his later ven- 
tures in more specific tales of war and politics fail 
to equal the delicate artistic suggestion, and the 
intensified focalized interest, of these earlier ro- 
mances of " Dr. Sevier," " The Grandissimmes," 
and " Madame Delphine." 

While American novelists are fast appreciating 
the unrivalled mines of literary material still un- 
worked within their land, while few nations have 
had, within so brief a time, history of so great mo- 
ment with such varied and faithful records, only a 
few scattered fragments of our history have thus 
far been chosen for portrayal by novelists of broad 
intellect and trained imagination. Especially bar- 
ren of romantic treatment are the periods of settle- 
ment in the central states, the witchcraft delusion, 
and that " critical period of American history " 
which succeeded the Revolution and preceded the 
War of 1812. The latter event, and the years of 
political ferment and social and intellectual awaken- 



ing prior to the Civil War, also afford diverse themes 
for pictorial narrative and vivid characterization, 
though the dramatic scenes are less distinct. 

Four periods have furnished popular motives 
for the American historical novelists, — the first 
half- century of colonial life in Massachusetts and 
Virginia, the English-French relations before the 
French and Indian War, the scenes and characters 
concentred about the movements of the Revolution- 
ary army in New York and Maryland, and the 
Civil War with its aftermath of Reconstruction. 
The early settlements in Virginia especially afford 
tempting themes for research and roseate fancy. 
The peculiar comingling of the primeval and the 
cultured, the interrelations of scholars and royal 
favorites with the savages and their weird customs, 
furnish the imagination with matchless episodes. 

In romantic and stirring flavor, the early records 
of Virginia far surpass those of the Massachusetts 
colony. Their conditions were quite distinctive, 
and the attempt to correlate these in one romance, 
as in " King Noanett," disclosed the detached back- 
grounds which defied the novelist's attempted junc- 
ture and remained coeval only in time. History 
has made us more familiar with the aspects of the 
Pilgrims and the Puritans ; we have too much neg- 
lected the histories of Virginian life by Byrd and 
Beverly. The portrayal of scenes at Jamestown 
and Flower da Hundred has the charm of sensuous 
atmosphere and unique romantic traditions. Mrs. 
Goodwin's romances, despite technical defects, retain 
one's interest ; and " White Aprons " and " The 
Colonial Cavalier" are pure and vivid in back- 
ground and in emotional treatment. The pictorial 
and pathetic episodes of " wife-auction " and slave- 
commitment have been forcefully revealed in 
" Prisoners of Hope," « To Have and to Hold," 
and "Free to Serve." In Miss Johnston's initial 
story, and in her later romances, one is especially 
impressed by her vital prodigal skill in rapid nar- 
rative. After reading " Sherlock Holmes," Steven- 
son wrote to Conan Doyle : "That is the class of 
literature that I like when I have the tooth-ache." 
Of this thrilling type was " To Have and to Hold," 
and the reader, chained to the breathless whirl of 
the author's imagination, did not pause to note the 
dramatic flaws until the race was finished. Then 
the unbroken succession of adventures with Indians, 
pirates, panthers, poisons, and shipwrecks, seemed 
less real, and he began to question the probable 
method by which Jeremy Sparrow killed those last 
three Indians, and realized that his imagination, 
like the author's, was wearied of devising ways and 
means. " Audrey " is a distinct advance upon the 
earlier romances of this author, and the character 
of the heroine reveals rare insight and delicacy of 
portraiture ; far more restraint is noted in the 
structure of events, though there are still evidences 
of immature literary powers. 

The very names of Pontiac and Quebec are sug- 
gestive of romance and dramatic history, and their 



372

possibilities have been well tested by Gilbert Parker. 
The famous battle on the Plains of Abraham has 
yet to receive more vivid portrayal than in " The 
Seats of the Mighty." It is the privilege of a his- 
torical romancer to choose a mystery or a mooted 
tradition about some historical character, and inter- 
weave upon this thread a story of double charm. 
To this type of fiction belongs " Henry Esmond " 
and "Unknown to History" of the past, and the 
recent romances, " When Valmond Came to Pon- 
tiac," Mr. Parker's fanciful tale of the traditional 
son of Napoleon, and Mrs. Catherwood's alluring 
picture of the Dauphin, escaped from France and 
meeting sundry adventures in America under the 
name of " Lazarre." As in her earlier stories of 
frontier life in the Northwest, Mrs. Catherwood has 
shown a scholarly, leisurely portrayal. Perhaps 
no historical romance of pioneer life in the North- 
west, with interrelations of Indians, French, and 
English, has equalled in romantic daring and pic- 
torial glow " Alice of Old Vincennes." 

The younger generation of American students 
may gain correct and broad views of the Revolu- 
tionary struggle, and just estimates of both Tory 
and Patriot leaders. The old-time hatred and 
surmises have given way before the deep truth- 
searching attitude of this age. Text-books and 
romances alike respond to this large and true intel- 
ligence and educated sympathy. Among a wide 
variety of historical novels of recent years, por- 
traying many phases of this crucial period, three 
especially suggest parallelisms and contrasts, and 
have won popular and scholarly success. " Hugh 
Wynne " unfolded in careful outlines the social and 
civic status of the period in Pennsylvania; "Janice 
Meredith " portrayed the domestic and military life 
of New Jersey ; " Bichard Carvel " revealed the 
political and social atmosphere of Maryland. " Hugh 
Wynne" surpassed in characterization, "Janice 
Meredith" in scenic and romantic pictures, and 
" Richard Carvel " in breadth of scope and easeful 
yet sustained plot. 

Mrs. Gertrude Atherton has drawn a picture 
of Alexander Hamilton, "The Conqueror," with 
excess of material and exuberance of laudation. 
There ar^, however, a few scenes of historical and 
dramatic vigor, portrayals both of crucial scenes 
during the war, viewed from close range by the 
great generals, and also emphasis of that lesser- 
known yet vital conflict which transformed the 
chaotic, anarchical states at the close of the war 
into a federation. If she has overestimated the 
part played by her hero in some of these events, 
she has vivified the struggle for Federalism and 
has surrounded Hamilton with a large and diverse 
group of American statesmen, whose salient traits 
have been well delineated. 

Coeval with the Civil War appeared a few novels 
of intense lurid force, but utterly lacking in poise 
and finish. While Mrs. Stowe's work possessed 
some qualities that ensured its longer life, the ef- 



forts of her compeers, Simms, Tourgee, Lanier, 
have been wholly submerged. In contrast with 
these fervid novels are the recent portrayals of 
both the war and the reconstruction blunders, re- 
sults of calm perspective and judicial adjustment 
of past conditions after time has allayed the ex- 
citement and invective. The vividness and pene- 
trative insight are commingled with a scholarly 
interpretation in such fiction as "John March, 
Southerner," " Red Rock," " The Crisis," « Henry 
Bourland," and "The Battle-Ground." While 
there is no loss of vitality or sympathy, the later 
novelists have justly emphasized the significant 
causes and results of the conflict and have treated 
with impartial colors the heroes and charlatans of 
both North and South. 

The two forms of historical fiction, — the romance 
of adventure and the analytic novel of character, — 
have been well exampled in recent American fiction. 
The first type is evidenced in such stirring tales as 
"The Chief Factor," "To Have and to Hold," 
and " From Kingdom to Colony "; the second form 
is recognized in " Hugh Wynne," " The Crisis," " The 
Reign of Law," and " The Tory Lover." To avoid 
the stilted and discursive defects of the earlier nov- 
elists, Scott, Cooper, and their successors, and at 
the same time shun the sensational unreserve and 
haste of some of the most popular later romancers, 
would seem the safe passage for the historical nov- 
elist. Whether as romance of hazard or narrative 
of manners, whether restricted to imaginary char- 
acters or repainting actual personages, the novelist 
of history should have one ultimate mission, — to 
create a story of vital and universal interest, wherein 
ideality and reality are wisely commingled. His 
task is to illustrate Carlyle's words : " The Past has 
always something true, and is a precioas possession. 
In a different time, in a different place, it is always 
some other side of our common Human Nature that 
has been developing itself."

THE 



ELIZABETHAN PLAY IN 
CHICAGO. 



Ever since the mediaeval drama broke away from 
the Church and got into the public square, and 
thence into the public theatre-house, the tenure of 
the theatre, and of dramatic literature regarded as 
the material for stage-acting, has been an uncertain 
one. This has especially been the case in English- 
speaking countries, where a certain Puritan prudery 
distrustful of histrionics, and a certain resolute in- 
dependence of individual initiative, have kept the 
•stage a private enterprise and have refused to recog- 
nize its institutional function. On the continent of 
Europe things have turned out otherwise, and in 
many cities the theatre is a recognized institution 
supported and countenanced by the State. 

With us of late there are some signs of change. 



1902.] 



THE DIAL 



378 



A converted few are urging an endowed theatre. 
And just as the universities and large public schools 
of the English renaissance practised stage-perfor- 
mances, in both Latin and English, as a regular and 
recognized part of the college activities, so now the 
American universities are rapidly if somewhat 
blindly beginning to enlarge their horizons, admit 
the educative and cultural value of the practical 
dramatic art, and make Sophocles, Shakespeare, 
Jonson, Moliere, and the rest, a living text as well 
as a closet page. 

The ideally equipped university of the immediate 
future will doubtless have, alongside of its other 
laboratories, what without undue forcing of the 
already hackneyed metaphor we may call a labor- 
atory of dramatic art, — a theatre-building adequate 
for the presentation of classical plays from Greek, 
Latin, English, French, German, and other litera- 
tures. And not only this, but sufficient equipment 
and endowment ; so that provision can be made for 
regular and frequent performances of this sort 
without overtaxing the energies of the regular 
teaching sta£P. Indeed, as this is an age of aggre- 
gation and trusts, who knows but that a full-fledged 
theatre with a stock-company drawn from the Slite 
of the profession may before long settle down next 
to some university campus, — in short, an endowed 
theatre under university management and control ! 

Meanwhile, the ferment is working. Harvard, 
Yale, Wisconsin, Stanford, Michigan, Beloit, Wel- 
lesley, Smith, Bryn Mawr, Tufts College, and other 
institutions, have all made a beginning and have 
attempted the revival and stage-presentation of such 
specimens of the world's dramatic literature as are 
recognized as classical or typical. The University 
of Chicago is the latest convert to the new principle. 
A year ago a student performance of "As You 
Like It " was given on the university campus, and 
again on May 17 last, at the Auditorium Theatre 
in Chicago, a performance of Ben Jonson's com- 
edy of " The Case is Altered " in the Elizabethan 
manner was given, not, it is true under the direct 
auspices of the university, but by university students, 
and under the direction of a body composed chiefly 
of faculty members, faculty wives, and students, 
working together as the University Settlement 
League. The English department was called upon 
for advice ; Mr. S. H. Clark of the department of 
public speaking assisted in training the actors ; and 
Mr. F. L. Short, who has already had a main hand 
in some five or six such performances, came on 
from the East and managed the stage production. 
An elaborate illustrative programme was printed, 
and the occasion was further commemorated by the 
issuance of a reprint of the play itself, with brief 
introduction and text reconstituted on the basis of 
the original edition. The affair itself was a success. 
A large and sympathetic audience, tolerant of 
amateurism and friendly to the main cause, grati- 
fied its curiosity and reaped amusement in various 
forms. If the audience was tolerant and made 



concessions so also did the university managers, 
who at points were forced to yield minor details of 
antiquarian accuracy to the exigency of popular 
effect. Indeed, any such performance must in some 
measure be a compromise. But the main effect 
was secured. That the path has been broken and 
a beginning made is a matter for congratulation, 
and is due chiefly to the admirable energy of the 
ladies of the League and its efficient managers and 
advisers. 

Three or four conclusions are to be gathered 
from this experiment. One is that the experiment 
is worth repeating, — perhaps under different con- 
ditions. Again, that the atmosphere of the uni- 
versity — the university on its own grounds and in 
its own house — is better for such a thing. The 
Auditorium stage was not well adapted for the pro- 
duction. The Elizabethan audience, which should 
have served the function of chorus and intermediary 
between the actors and the modern audience, was 
partly hidden from sight in a narrow space, or else 
too much crowded upon the Elizabethan stage itself. 
A university theatre-building is needed, with con- 
vertible stage and ample room in the pit for the 
accommodation of either Elizabethan stage and 
audience on the one hand, or of Greek chorus on 
the other. The students on this occasion, both in 
the play and in the Elizabethan audience, contrib- 
uted their parts with admirable spirit and willing- 
ness. A considerable part of the value of such 
performances is obviously the training gained by 
those who take part. Another time, however, the 
experiment might be varied by securing the assist- 
ance of semi-professionals (at least) in the major 
parts of the cast, as was done in the Harvard per- 
formance of " Epicceae," leaving the joyous business 
of the mock-audience, as always, to the students. 
Another time, too, with a cast so strengthened and 
with more time for drill and preparation, a stronger 
play may be hazarded. Then also the local " busi- 
ness," — archteological details and reproductions in 
culture-history, — on which so much of the pictur- 
esque effect depends, can be more carefully elab- 
orated. Perhaps, for example, in the course of 
time a university audience can be led to the point 
of patiently and sympathetically listening' to an 
entire Shakespearian play, uncut (a matter often 
of between three and four hours), and in the original 
setting. Such things are as yet unknown in America. 
In Munich, however, the present writer has listened 
to a four-hour performance of the unabridged 
German " Hamlet." The success of the University 
last year in its performance of " As You Like It " 
in modern form would suggest the possibility of a 
still greater academic success in similar things in 
the stricter original form and setting. Chicago is 
ready to furnish appreciation and support, the 
University has the requisite energy, atmosphere, 
learning, and personnel. The one thing lacking is 
the material equipment. Will that be provided ?

Charles Lamb had a list of hibliaa-biblia, — 
books which, though they contain printed mat- 
ter, " are not books." It is questionable whether 
books consisting entirely of illustrations, with 
almost no printing, can be termed literature; 
but several of the garden books which appear 
this season manage to convey an infinite amount 
of information with scant printed words, — 
trusting to the sight of the things themselves 
as shown in lavish illustration. Two of the 
largest and most important of these books are 
collections of drawings and photographic re- 
productions, relating, one to English and Scotch 
gardens, the other to American gardens. It 
has been pleasant to study them together, to 
compare them, and to note the differences in 
the gardens thus represented. 

Mr. Inigo Triggs's work on "Formal Gar- 
dens in England and Scotland " is in three 
parts. Part I. has 118 pages of plates; of 
these, but sixteen are actual photographs of 
English and Scotch gardens, while the others 
are sketch-plans and elevations, drawings of 
gates, walls, bits of terraces, fountains, sun- 
dials, garden houses, lead figures, vases, col- 
umns, cornices, balustrades, dove-cotes, garden- 
steps, knots, parterres, and various garden- 
furnishings. The photographs of gardens in 
this part contribute little that is new to the 
published information about English gardens, 
especially to those who have read the pages and 
seen the illustrations in "Country Life" during 
the six years of its existence. But the sketch- 
plans and elevations are of great interest and 
value, both to garden-lovers and garden-archi- 
tects. Part II. of Mr. Triggs's work shows a 
wonderful advance over Part I. both in interest 
and beauty. Some familiar English gardens 
of rather hackneyed illustration are shown, as 
those of Hampton Court and Levens Hall ; but

the views given in this book are unusual and 
effective, and it is most gratifying to have the 
skilfully-drawn sketches, elevations, and bird's- 
eye views of those well-known gardens, also 
many of their effective details and out-of-the- 
way corners. The Englishman has ever felt 
"the lure of green things growing," as said 
Piers Plowman ; and in all greenery his garden 
excelled those of any land. At this day the great- 
est difference between English and American 
gardens is not in the flowers but in the per- 
fect lawns, the splendid hedges, the topiary 
work of the old-world pleasaunces; in all, in 
fact, that shows the skilled care of many, many 
years. Our few hedges are all new; an old 
hedge is almost unknown in America ; for the 
yews and hollies of English hedges did not 
flourish here. With the recent establishment 
of hedges, an air of stability and finality has 
been given to our gardens, which has added 
infinitely to their charm. 

The book entitled "American Gardens,'* 
edited by the well-known architect Mr. Guy 
Lowell, has been frequently compared to a 
somewhat similar book on English gardens, 
called "Gardens Old and New"; and the 
American photographs have been disparaged. 
They certainly equal the English views in 
quality ; but some may appear inferior because 
there are two or even four views on a single 
page, — an arrangement which is to be de- 
plored. It was not the intent of the American 
book, as of the English one, to display only 
the views of costly and elaborate gardens of 
houses of great wealth; many views are given 
of old gardens of small size and historic in- 
terest, others of small size but of great artistic 
merit. The views of old gardens are in general 
the most pleasing. In looking over the assem- 
bled American views, I am struck with the 
indigenous aspect which the American garden 
has developed. We have taken our plans and 
notions from foreign gardens, chiefly those of 
England, with hints from Holland and Italy; 
but Nature has prohibited an exact imitation 
and suggested new features entirely unlike the 
gardens of Europe. So wonderfully is this 
shown in this book that I am led to believe 
that garden-making will become a representa- 
tive art in America, and be regarded as an in- 
digenous art, — if such a term be proper. I 
am glad to think of this book as going to 
England, where it will show to English readers 
how unlike a real American garden is the so- 
called "American garden" of the English 
florist and gardener, — a garden where crim-

son, purple, and magenta rhododendrons are 
blended and jumbled, and bordered with pink 
and orange and salmon azalias ; a garden which 
contains a few plants of what the English gar- 
dener calls " American wood-lilies," and dog- 
tooth violets, and California poppies, and which 
is supposed to "remind us of home." An- 
other agreeable truth proved by this American 
book of gardens is the fact that a lovely gar- 
den and even a formal garden is within the 
possibility of the flower-lover of moderate 
means. Photography often gives an exagger- 
ated perspective, and has made some of these 
gardens appear much larger than they really 
are. But a majority of those shown are of 
comparatively slight cost and not of large size ; 
in fact, some of the most charming are the 
least costly ones. The book has a few well- 
written pages as a prologue, and as an epilogue 
the sketch-plans of all the formal gardens pic- 
tured in it. The Introduction is so well written 
and interesting that the reader wishes it were 
much longer. 

These two books offer an answer to the 
question asked so frequently of late, " Where 
can I find drawings and views to aid me in 
laying out a formal garden ? " Usually it is 
also qualified by being a small formal garden ; 
which makes somewhat superfluous the reply, 
" Employ a skilled architect to make drawings 
and estimates for you." The great need in a 
successful formal garden is that it shall be 
" on scale," and of course a skilled designer is 
far more able to accomplish this than a hap- 
hazard flower-lover. For the garden changes ; 
shrubberies alter in density and shape ; trees 
grow surprisingly ; it hurts so to cut down a 
tree, or remove a beautiful shrub ; and in a 
few years all the proportions of the garden are 
changed and lost. 

The writer of this review has a winter 
home in the city of Greater New York, which 
chances to be upon the block chosen, on ac- 
count of the permanency of its residents, by 
the Municipal Art League of that city to prove 
what can be done to beautify a block of city 
houses by means of tree and vine planting, 
and the placing and planting of window-boxes. 
This block was jestingly dubbed the " Block 
Beautiful" (though the name and adjective 
seem to have naught in common). The fami- 
lies resident thereon all leave the city in early 
summer and do not return till late autumn ; so 
the adorning of these houses is purely a public- 
spirited deed, to gratify the eyes of chance 
passers-by, — who are chiefly, in mid-summer, 



the city's poor. In the planting of window- 
boxes in this Block Beautiful, much monotony 
at first obtained. We had scarcely more 
variety than the " widow-woman " of " Pas- 
quile's Jests " (1604), wherein it was told at 
a country-inn, as a matter of vast wonder, that 
in London the citizens " take in their gardens 
at night within their windows, and let them 
out in the morning." Whereat gaping yokels 
went up to London town in a body to see the 
rare sight, and they did there behold the 
widow-woman putting out at her casements 
boxes of " Gilly-Flowers, Coronations, and 
Herbs." Formal geraniums, pale nasturtiums, 
graceless aspidistras, and dull ivy replaced 
in our window-boxes but sadly the sweet- 
scented, free- blooming, grateful, kindly Eliza- 
bethan blossoms of the old jest-book. But we 
have now a little book of scarcely more pages 
or bigger size, entitled " Miniature and Win- 
dow Gardening," which offers to all readers 
great variety of choice in window plants as 
well as most intelligent advice about making 
and maintaining the boxes ; and also the plant- 
ing of small city gardens and our hopeless 
back-yards. The book is so informal in diction 
and direct in expression, that it is as helpful as 
having an experienced and intelligent gardener 
at hand to answer questions ; and it is written 
for American climate and American money, 
and in that is a treasure, — for nearly all in- 
structive books on gardening are English and 
in general for the friendly climate of western 
England, and bewilder us with lists of flowers 
that will blossom in December, and others 
which should be planted in January. 

" A Garden in the Suburbs " is one of the 
several books evoked of late in the manner of 
Mrs. Earle's *' Pot-pourri in a Surrey Gar- 
den," a familiar record of homely thoughts in a 
home garden, on flowers and fruits, and on 
subjects suggested by and akin to gardening. 
None of these several followers of Mrs. Earle 
have equalled the prototype in interest or value, 
for hers is the sort of book and sort of literary 
composition which does not well bear imitation. 
The original had the charm of frank narrative ; 
but this was the narrative of a charming woman, 
and the book was also useful. " A Garden in 
the Suburbs" is of little value to the American 
garden-maker, and it is, I believe, the only 
one of Mr. John Lane's round dozen " Books 
about Gardens " which is not. The book is a 
distinct negative in style ; it is full of what 
not to do, and what wasn't done right, and 
what that special soil would not grow, and

what flowers would not bloom in that garden ; 
and it communicates this characteristic nega- 
tion to the reader. 

Among these books of Mr. Lane's are re- 
prints of two of the classics of garden-literature, 
— Forbes Watson's " Flowers and Gardens," 
published nearly thirty years ago, and John 
Sedding's " Garden-Craft Old and New," pub- 
lished first in 1890. A certain pathetic interest 
attaches to both of these books, written by men 
of enthusiasm and genius, who died young. 
Dr. Watson's book was written during the last 
painful months of an insidious disease, and 
finished two days before his death. Sedding's 
had been given to the publishers ; but he died 
suddenly before it was set in type. The first 
half of Dr. Watson's book is devoted to a series 
of monographs on a handful of familiar flowers, 
the snowdrop, snowflake, daffodil, crocus, and 
others ; these are the most extraordinary plant- 
portraits ever written. Every line of color, 
every outline of petal, every curve of leaf, re- 
vealed to this author the full secret of its beauty 
and meaning ; and his deeply religious and ar- 
tistic nature made him understand and translate 
this secret of plant-life and plant-beauty into 
words. The second part, on Gardens, dealt the 
first effective blow at "bedding-out gardening," 
and that at a time when such gardens were a 
British idol. Its two sections, " Faults in Gar- 
dening " and " Gardeners' Flowers," contain 
some of the most exquisite sentences and thoughts 
upon gardens in the English language, and some 
of the most keenly sarcastic as well. In his out- 
burst against variegated foliage, he ridicules 
the " scarlet geranium whose leaf edges are 
broadly buttered around," and writes of " colors 
frittered away amid contrasts of leaves, spotted 
and streaked in every sort of deformity, . . . 
green grounds peppered over with bright red, 
or tricksily wrought out in cream color." And 
with what keen and sensible words he writes of 
doubled flowers ; not too sweeping in aversion, 
but giving honor where honor is due — as to 
the double peony. Part III. of the book, " On 
Vegetation," has an exquisite chapter on " The 
Withering of Plants," — a chapter which has 
a deep inner meaning when we recall that it 
was written in the fading of the author's own 
life. 

The Preface of John Sedding's book on 
" Garden-Craft " was lovingly written by a 
fellow-worker in the Church, and displays to 
us so noble a character, so sensitive, lovable, 
and impulsive a nature, so beautiful and relig- 
ious a life, ended with that of his wife Rose in 



such a touching and unusual manner, that I 
am tempted do dwell longer on the man than 
on his book. It made so profound an impres- 
sion on me when I first read it that it has ever 
stood out in my memory as the record of one 
of those singularly exalted natures which one 
meets or reads of so rarely. Sedding has been 
termed by British enthusiasts the " Isaak 
Walton of Gardening." I search in vain for 
the slightest verisimilitude of thought which 
should warrant this title. There is nothing in 
his literary style or his teaching to suggest it ; 
he has none of Walton's love of country-life in 
the fields, nor Walton's quaintness and sim- 
plicity of speech ; his book is that of a crafts- 
man, as its title indicates, and is apparently 
written to prove the truth of Sir Walter Scott's 
line, " Nothing is more truly the Child of Art 
than a Garden." He says plainly : 

" Because Art stands sponsor for the grace of a Gar- 
den, because all gardening is Art or nothing, we need 
not fear to overdo Art in a garden, nor need we fear to 
make avowal of the secret of its charm. I have no 
more scruple in using the scissors upon tree or shrub 
where trimness is desirable than I have in mowing the 
turf of a lawn that once represented the virgin world. 
There is a quaint charm in the results of the topiary 
art, in the prim imagery of evergreens that all ages 
have felt." 

He pleads for the cedar-walks, the bowers, the 
alleys, the mazes, the high hedges of the old 
English pleasaunce, " hidden happily and 
shielded safe." Sedding's essays are purely 
academic in character, and deal with generali- 
ties rather than special illustrations. In the 
chapter entitled " The Technics of Gardening" 
he enters into some detail, giving suggestions 
as to the selection and placing of plants and 
trees, the relations of the house to the terraces, 
lawns, etc., and he gives a few sketches and 
diagrams, of much " niceness " of drawing, as 
became an architect, which he was. His chap- 
ters are thoroughly scholarly, showing ample 
reading of garden-literature and ready quota- 
tion. He notes ably how the texture of the 
speech of the old poets Herrick, Herbert, 
Donne, Vaughan, and infinitely Shakespeare, 
is saturated with garden-imagery; and his 
chapters are persuasive as well, for he had 
both the culture and the enthusiasm to fit him 
to write effectively upon his chosen subject. 
He is unsparing of criticism of the "Natural" 
school of gardening, as advocated by Mr. Rob- 
inson ; and he formed a strong ally to the party 
which waged war against that school, though 
his book has one chapter entitled " In Praise 
of Savagery." The Formal Garden was never

more ably championed ; and he does more — 
he makes his readers love it. He longed to 
see the old gardens reproduced everywhere, 
hoping they would bring back with them the 
charm of the quiet beautiful life of their day. 
He calls them " beautiful yesterday, beautiful 
to-day, beautiful always." He loved the old 
gardens for qualities which I have ever felt 
and loved in them, as tangible shapes of the 
moods and tastes of our ancestors ; as embodi- 
ments of ancient worth and stability ; as evi- 
dences of a devotion to one's native land and 
one's home soil, and interest in and effort to 
beautify it. It is seldom given to a reviewer 
to help to awaken a general interest in books 
he has long known and cared for. These two 
books of these two English garden-lovers, 
printed first in but small number, have been 
known and beloved by me for over a decade, 
and I trust their reprints may find hundreds of 
lovers and readers in America in decades to 



come.

which the letter-press has been written, the 
narrative still running in the first person as the 
father's experience. Both father and daughter 
are in love with Japan and its art. Mr. Menpes 
seems to have taken the attitude, while with the 
natives of the country, of a fellow-workman in 
the finer things of life, who was seeking means 
of comparison and instruction. This sincere 
and sympathetic attitude gained for him an 
insight into the inner lives of this marvellous 
people, particularly those of the artist-artisan 
class so common there and so rare elsewhere. 
The pictures in color which decorate the book 
leave it almost or quite without a peer among 
volumes of its kind. A characteristic passage 
is selected from many for quotation here, 
though it is to be regretted that space does 
not suffice for telling the story of the manner 
in which Mr. Menpes procured the specially- 
wrought furnishings of his London house in 
lieu of this : 

" A Japanese gardener spends bis whole life in 
studying his trade, and just as earnestly and just as 
comprehensively as a doctor would study medicine, I 
was once struck by seeing a little man sitting on a box 
outside of a silk-store on a bald plot of ground. For 
three consecutive days I saw this little man sitting on 
the same little box, forever smiling and knocking out 
the ash from bis miniature pipe. All day long he sat 
there, never moving, never talking, — he seemed to 
be doing nothing but smoking and dreaming. On the 
third day I pointed this little man out to the merchant 
who owned the store, and asked what the little man was 
doing and why he sat there, ' He 's thinking,' said the 
merchant. • Yes ; but why must he think on that bald 
spot of ground ? What is he going to do ? ' I asked, 
perplexed. The merchant gazed at me in astonishment, 
mingled with pity. ' Don 't you know,' he said, ' he is 
one of our greatest landscape gardeners, and for three 
days he has been thinking out a garden for me ? If you 
care to come here in a few days,' he added, ' I will 
show you the drawings for that garden all completed.' 
I came in a few days, and I was shown the most 
exquisite set of drawings it has ever been my good 
fortune to behold. What a garden it would be ! 
There were full-grown trees, stepping-stones, miniature 
bridges, ponds of gold-fish — all presenting an appear- 
ance of vastness, yet in reality occupying an area the 
size of a small room. And not only was the garden 
itself planned out and designed, but it was also 
arranged to form a pattern in relation to the trees and 
the houses and the surrounding hills." 

The Rev. Julius Smith's "Ten Years in 
Burma " is a record of the missions planted in 
that country by the American Methodist Epis- 
copal Church, which have gone unrecorded 
until now, though they are twenty-two years 
old. This country has a particular interest for 
missionaries from the United States, for it was 
there that Adoniram Judson and Luther Rice 
went in 1812, the first of their countrymen to

embark on this pious enterprise. Mr. Smith 
records the fact that the proselytes made by 
these two men have perpetuated their work, 
and that to their teachings, borne out in prac- 
tice, is to be ascribed the survival of the Karens, 
a race seemingly marked for extinction. Mr. 
Smith has a great deal to say about the evil 
effects of intoxicating drink on the Burmese, 
and yet fails to say that they were, like all un- 
contaminated Buddhists, among the most ab- 
stemious peoples in the world until Great 
Britain established the miserable trade in 
liquor in the kingdom. The book shows good 
progress made, reports the marked results ob- 
tained by the mission priests of the Roman 
Church, and urges the need of many more 
laborers in a most promising vineyard. It 
seems a pity that some of these devoted and 
self-sacrificing men cannot conduct a mission 
to the putative Christians who are selling the 
Burmese bad rum ! 

Dr. Maltbie Davenport Babcock, pastor of 
the Brick Presbyterian Church in New York 
City, died abroad last year, while engaged in 
the extended journey which he has set forth in 
detail in the "Letters from Egypt and Pales- 
tine," now published in response to the demands 
of his congregation. These letters were writ- 
ten to be read to the Men's Association in the 
church, and form a continuous narrative of 
the author's wanderings in Egypt, the Holy 
Land, and through to Constantinople, all art- 
lessly and vivaciously told. Designed for such 
an audience and not for the general reading 
public, they are more intimate in their nature 
than most tales of the kind, and betray a kindly 
and attractive personality. 

It is not difficult to account for the cause 
that has sent three books concerning the em- 
pire of Morocco into the world at once. The 
people and their country stand quite alone as 
Moslem on the shores of the Mediterranean 
Sea, wholly under the control of nations reck- 
oned in Christendom until its eastern extremity 
is reached. Slavery and polygamy flourish 
there unabashed, and the degree of culture is 
that of centuries ago. Nowhere can the civil- 
ization of Europe and America be left so far 
behind in so short a voyage, and the land seems 
destined to secure a larger and larger share of 
the business of tourists. Of the three books, 
Mr. Budgett Meakin's "The Moors " is some- 
thing more than a mere record of a brief so- 
journ. By his three preceding volumes on the 
same general topic, one of them published less 
than a year ago, Mr. Meakin has established 



himself as an authority on the country in all 
respects, and his preface contains a touching 
account of the disadvantages and rebuffs under 
which he began his studies, and the manner in 
which the difficulties have been surmounted. 
Living long in the land, he has attained the 
comprehension that leads to sympathy, and his 
book is everywhere informed with good-will 
and understanding. It differs from its prede- 
cessors in having a uniformly lighter touch, 
discussing all sides of Moorish life, and bring- 
ing out the virtues of the people side by side 
with their evident limitations. He says, for 
example : 

" When a Moor is treated to a good joke, he knows 
how to enjoy it to the full; and, seated on the floor, 
he sways backwards and forwards without restraint to 
his laughter, a common practice being for the speaker 
and listener so to enjoy it together, raising their right 
hands far above their heads as they roll back, and then, 
with a sweep round, bringing them together for a 
hearty shake : there was never invented a grander way 
for enjoying a joke. The women, when happy, give 
vent to their feelings by a shrill ululation produced by 
the soft palate : • Yoo yoo, yoo yoo, yoo yoo yoo! ' which 
it would be difficult for untrained women to produce, 
and out of the question for men to attempt." 

The modern ideas regarding womankind in 
general have not penetrated to the Moors, as 
the following citation of authority attests : 

"The estimation in which Mohammedans hold the 
common-sense of their women may be judged from the 
advice of the Imam et-Tarai: * It is desirable for a man, 
before entering upon any important undertaking, to con- 
sult ten intelligent friends; or if he have not more than 
five such friends, let him consult each of them twice; 
or if he have no more than one such friend, he should 
consult that one at ten different times ; if he have none 
to consult, let him consult his wife, and whatever she 
advises him, let him do the opposite; so shall he pro- 
ceed rightly in his affair, and attain his object.' " 

Miss Frances MacNab has travelled exten- 
sively in South Africa and British Columbia, 
and though she did not leave the beaten paths 
in Morocco, she brought keen and trained 
powers of observation to her task of setting 
forth, in " A Ride in Morocco," the facts 
within her rather narrow limits. Of most in- 
terest to Americans will be the chapter in 
which she relates the sailing up of the Ameri- 
can armored cruiser " New York" for the pur- 
pose of settling a dispute with the Moorish 
empire, and its subsequent sailing away again 
with its task unaccomplished, amid the broad 
smiles of the unterrified Moslems, — indicating 
that the " world-power " business is in need of 
more training if it is to be successful. Our ex- 
traordinary consular service is illustrated by 
the following excerpt: 



1902.]

« Morocco is not a country which lends itself to the 
compiling of reports. I never was anywhere where 
statistics or figures helped one so little, ' They wrote 
to me from Washington,' said Captain Cobb, ' to send 
them a report of the cholera. So I started out to see 
what I could do, and I met two Moors dragging a dead 
one. So I said, " What killed that man? " And they 
said, " Allah — Allah killed him." I went a little fur- 
ther and met another, and I asked, " What killed that 
man? " and they said, " Allah." So I came back, and 
wrote to say that I had seen two dead Moors, and the 
people said God had killed them, and that was all I 
knew.' What occurred in Washington when this report 
was received I do not know, but the account gives an 
absolutely just idea of some of the obstacles in the way 
of making reports, and the value of some reports when 
made." ♦ 

Lady Agnes Grove visited Morocco with her 
husband and several friends of both sexes, and 
their experiences and observations are em- 
bodied in her book entitled " Seventy-one Days' 
Camping in Morocco." She was at Mogador, 
and went hunting in the mountains, receiving 
several incidental invitations from natives to 
visit them in remote districts ; and it is easily to 
be credited that she would have accepted these 
if left to herself, notwithstanding the rather 
disquieting nature of the following passage : 

'• Every eminence, every mountain pass, and almost 
every road in the plain along which we travelled, bear 
witness in the shape of heaps of stones to battle, murder, 
and sudden death. If a solitary heap is seen, then it 
has been a murder ; if the heaps are many, then it is 
the site of one or perhaps several battles — possibly 
through one of the murders having created a < blood 
feud ' between two tribes, when the first murdered man 
having been avenged, the avenger in his turn is sought 
out and killed, and so the feud continues from genera- 
tion to generation, when the origin of the quarrel is a 
mere tradition and perhaps even unknown. Some of 
the heaps of stones consist of as few perhaps as five 
stones, but so arranged as to prevent any possibility of 
their having been mistaken for a natural or accidental 
heap. In some cases the branches of the trees were 
piled up with stones, showing that the combatant had 
been shot dead in his post of vantage." 

Mr. Spender, the author of " Two Winters 
in Norway," seems to have been a fairly good 
traveller, though he indulges in an occasional 
British protest because the Norwegian hotels 
would not give him marmalade or jam for his 
breakfast. His journey to the Lapps, though 
given a chapter, was absolutely barren of note- 
worthy results, only a family or two having 
been visited after a great deal of trouble. Per- 
haps the most interesting chapter in the book 
deals with " ski-lobing," the national winter 
sport of the country, consisting of a long slide 
down a hill on the native snow-shoes, ending 
in a leap through the air, the difficulty being 
to come up standing on the snow below. Mr. 
Spender describes it thus : 



" By the judge's box a flag is lowered, a mournful 
note is sounded somewhere out of sight, and whilst we 
are wondering and raising our eyes upwards we espy a 
black speck racing down the hill, and before we can 
quite take in what has happened the first jumper has 
reached the base of the hill. We are dullards, and 
have to collect our thoughts more sharply. Another 
note is sounded, another black figure darts down; we 
turn around; he is in the air, and he too has reached 
the bottom. We have to be sharper still if we wish to 
watch the jumper throughout. First he slips over the 
brow of the hill, tears down the narrow incline with 
feet well set, but knees bent and with eyes straining 
towards the bank from which he is to make his leap. 
There is silence, the breath of everyone is checked, the 
jumper has reached the platform, he springs right for- 
ward, away into space, steadies himself in mid-air, still 
for the tenth of a second, then he drops like a hawk 
onto the slope of the hill beneath. Here comes the real 
test, for if he has done well he will land so that his 
right foot is slightly in advance of his left, but pointing 
straight in front with knees barely bent and his hands 
rigid at his side. Then he slips down as he holds him- 
self erect into the flat open space beneath, where he 
joins the little knot of those who have preceded him 
and are ready to congratulate him upon his neatness of 
style." 

« A Golden Way," by Mr. Albert Le Roy 
Bartlett, is a good illustration of the fact that 
the traveller takes his capacity for enjoyment 
with him, instead of finding it on the road. 
Mr. Bartlett filled his mind with the literature 
of England and the sister kingdoms before he 
began his journey across them, — largely on 
foot, — and his book abounds in literary allu- 
sions. In Ireland he went to Muckross Lake, 
and he preserves some of the anecdotes related 
to him by his guide, the first in reference to 
the small island in the middle of that beautiful 
little sheet of water. 

" < An' let me tell yes,* said Robert, • how thet island 
came there. Do ye see thet mountain up there with 
the hole in the side ? Well, the Divil one marnin' hed 
jist taken a bite out of thet mountain for his breakfast, 
an' gone on a walk across the lake, whin he met the 
O'Donahue. The O'Donahue was a very polite man, 
an' whin he met the Divil, " Good marnin' to your lard- 
ship," says the O'Donahue. Now the Divil did not wish 
to be outdone in politeness by the O'Donahue, an' 
" Good marnin' to yourself," says the Divil. An' whin 
he opened his mouth, the mouthful fell out an' made 
thet island.' . . . 

" ' An' let me tell yes,' said Robert, ' two years ago 
an American gintleman came here, an' he went up to 
thet very punchbowl [a pool just above the lake]. It 
was a very warm day, an' he says to me, " Robfert, I'll 
be after havin' a swim here." " Indade ye must not," 
says I; "there's no bottom to the hole, sir." "Thin, 
Robert," says he, " I'll just dive through it." An' 
nather mesilf nor his frinds could prevint him. So he 
made a great spring, an' down he wint. We waited 
for him to rise, an' he niver came. Tin minutes, an' 
he wasn't back. An hour more, an' we gathered up 
his clothes and wint back to the hotel. His frinds were 
distracted, an' they wint up the next day, but there was

no trace of bim. They waited there two weeks for him, 
thinkin' his body would rise; but it didn't. Now gintle- 
min, twelve weeks from the day thet he dived there 
came a telegram from Australia, sayin', " I've arrived. 
Sind on me clothes." ' " 

Lieutenant J. W. G. Walker, of the U. S. 
Navy, was attached to the party which made 
the preliminary survey on the Nicaraguan 
Canal for the United States Commission, and 
he reports strongly in favor of the adoption of 
that route. He believes that either that or the 
cutting at Panama is entirely practicable, and 
that the cost will be much the same, if the 
United States has to pay no more than $40,- 
000,000 for the work already done by the 
French company at Panama. He notes, too, 
that the cost of operating the Nicaraguan 
route will be $3,300,000 a year, not less than 
$1,300,000 more than its rival. Then, on the 
other hand, he sets forth that the more north- 
erly channel will effect a saving of a day or two 
on all American commerce, except that com- 
ing from the South American coasts through 
the canal to our own shores, Atlantic or 
Pacific ; that the hygienic conditions about 
Nicaragua are better, with less interruption 
from quarantine ; that it is possible to de- 
velop the countries through which the more 
northern canal passes, while Panama is hope- 
lessly barren; and that the trade-winds pre- 
vailing in the Nicaraguan belt will give sailing 
ships an advantage of nine days in reaching the 
termini of the channel. The enterprise will be 
commercially profitable, and much more than 
self-sustaining, in either event. In addition to 
a pleasant recital of his own experiences in the 
country, Lieutenant Walker has prepared an 
historical account of Nicaragua, including a 
brief memoir of his kinsman, William Walker, 
the great filibuster. The book is one of value, 
the possibility of the destruction of canal struc- 
tures by volcanic action being fully anticipated. 
After reciting the disturbances of a seismic 
nature that have occurred within historic times, 
the author concludes thus : 

" It will be seen that volcanic activity near the 
canal line is in a state of decadence, and that, judging 
from appearances, any further outbreak will be likely 
to occur near the middle of one of the volcanic ranges. 
When it is remembered that the destructive effect of 
an earthquake is limited to a comparatively small area 
immediately surrounding the epicentrum, there seems 
to be no reason for anticipating destructive shocks along 
the line of the proposed canal. Experience tends to 
show the soundness of this deduction, for shocks which 
have done much damage in Leon and Managua have 
been quite harmless at Rivas." 

Mr. Lanier McKee, author of " The Land 
of Nome," is a recent graduate of Yale, and 



a lawyer by profession. Hearing of the dis- 
covery of gold at Nome — rather literally "the 
jumping-off place of the world," as he calls it — 
he made a study of the laws governing mining 
localities as a preliminary, and in June of 
1900 arrived at the rapidly growing town. 
Here he became interested as the attorney for 
one of the litigants in a case, or series of cases, 
which involved enormously valuable interests 
at that point, and no small part of his breezily 
told narrative is concerned with the scandal 
which ensued, riesulting recently in the re- 
moval of the Alaskan judge opposed to his 
clients. In this recital it is quite evident that 
he intends to be fair, though an attorney under 
retainer is not always a disinterested witness. 
Besides this, the book shows the possibilities 
of success in a mining region without taking 
part in the arduous manual labor which mining 
itself involves, granted a sound mind and body. 
The extract following, describing Nome itself 
and the sorrows of some men with more appar- 
atus than experience, is characteristic. 

" Hundreds were living in tents upon the beach, 
thanks to the clemency of the weather. Within a very 
short distance from our camp, with their freight piled 
about, were the 'syndicate,' and quite unenthusiastic. 
Actually, the ' syndicate ' were selling out, and without 
a struggle. Several of its members very soon bade us 
farewell, and pulled out for what they thought the 
' real thing * — quartz mines in Oregon. And yet some 
of the mines on Anvil Creek even then, and with only 
a few men shovelling the pay dirt into the sluice boxes, 
were turning out from ten to fifteen thousand dollars a 
day. To be sure, this was for the few only, but, at the 
same time, it went to prove that the country was not a 
fraud. Even the dirt in those miserable Nome streets 
contained < colors,' or small particles of gold ; and it is an 
incongruous thought that, of all the cities of the world, 
Nome City, as it is called, most nearly approaches the 
apocalyptic condition of having its streets paved with 
gold ! " 

Good books of travel are so interesting and 
so well worth reading, that it is to be hoped 
the enormous growth of libraries, and the con- 
sequent increase of moneys available for the 
purchase of this rather expensive class of 
books, will soon persuade American publishers 
into the policy of bringing out enough of them 
to give America fairer and more adequate rep- 
resentation in comparison with England.

The late Augustus De Morgan's paper " On the

tended for members of the Society alone. It makes a

Books of Out-Door IjIfe.* 

A genuine interest in bird-study is not a 
passing emotion. Once astir in the earnest 
heart, the delight of it remains a source of 
active and ever fresh enjoyment, or abides as 
a lasting and beautiful memory. There is 
continual proof of this in the literature which 
embodies the experiences of bird-lovers, all of 
whom are fervent and most of them eloquent 
narrators. The intensity of their feeling gives 
them felicity of expression, and they become, 
as by a masterful impulse, fluent and pictur- 
esque in dealing with their subject. It is so 
with the lovers of nature in any of its mani- 
fold phases. There is scarcely a volume of the 
increasing number recording investigations in 
animal or plant life which is not charming and 
infectious in spirit and statement. 

Take the " Nestlings of Forest and Marsh," 
by Mrs. Irene Grosvenor Wheelock, as a 
chance example. The reader's attention is 
immediately arrested by the subtle grace of 
the language. It would not greatly matter if 
there were not much that is new being told ; 
the way of telling suffices. But there is really 
not a little that is new in the book, and the at-

tention is worthily rewarded. Mrs. Wheelock 
is untiring in the acquisition of bird-craft, and 
has allowed no sacrifice of physical comfort to 
deter her from the study of the feathered kind 
in their early growth and development. Day 
after day in spring and a large part of sum- 
mer, the first flush of dawn has found her on 
the watch by their cradles in the marsh, the 
meadow, and the forest, to note the changes in 
habit and aspect the hours have wrought dur- 
ing their period of bird-babyhood. Burning 
heat which sent the mercury up into the nine- 
ties, and the hundreds even, has failed to daunt 
her. She and her faithful companion, the 
" Man with the Camera," followed the fortunes 
of rail and quail, blackbird and sandpiper, 
from the building of the nest to the departure 
of the valiant fledglings on free, buoyant wing. 
From such unfaltering vigilance there must 
result new and valuable incidents in the his- 
tory of bird-life. These give Mrs. Wheelock's 
book an importance readily recognized. The 
external beauty of the volume adds a feature 
deserving favorable notice. The fair, open 
page, enriched with text illustrations and pho- 
togravures from original photographs, are in 
harmony with the pleasing contents. 

An equally striking instance of the spell 
which nature-themes exercise over speaker and 
hearer is afforded in the story of " Hezekiah's 
Wives," by Mrs. Lillie Hamilton French. 
Hezekiah was only a canary bird, and his wives 
were canaries like himself ; yet the doings of 
these small and by no means uncommon crea- 
tures so moved the heart and the imagination 
of their mistress that her rehearsal of them 
rouses a kindred enthusiasm in her audience. 
That a bird may have a pronounced personality, 
that it may approach near to humanity in its 
qualities, its affections, and its preferences, one 
is quickly convinced by her persuasive manner 
of putting the case. " Hezekiah " was a re- 
markable specimen of the ovion tribe, there is 
no doubt ; but his natural gifts were developed 
to a great extent by the sympathetic compan- 
ionship of the lady who treated him as one 
faithful and considerate friend treats another. 
It is suggestive evidence of the capacities of 
heart and head, as yet for the most part un- 
suspected, which belong to our fellow-beings in 
the lower ranks of creation. None who make 
the acquaintance of " Hezekiah," though at 
second-hand, can fail to be touched by the 
record of his virtues and moved to a more 
kindly regard for all his race.

and Field," by Mr. Ernest Ingersoll, relates 
to our common birds, the remaining portion 
treating of small quadrupeds, such as mice, 
squirrels, and weasels, with one chapter given 
to notes upon the snail. The book is a revision 
and enlargement of a volume published by the 
author some years ago under the title of 
" Friends Worth Knowing." In its present 
form it contains a store of late and curious 
facts gleaned from wide reading, together with 
original investigation. Mr. Ingersoll has the 
art of presenting his matter attractively, and 
calling to his aid interpretative illustrations. 

A book that can be slipped into the pocket 
is a desideratum on many occasions, and never 
more so than when one goes afield and would 
be free as may be from hand-baggage, which, 
even of the lightest sort, has a way of growing 
into a grievous burden as the hours pass on. 
Realizing this circumstance, Mr. F. Schuyler 
Mathews has conferred a veritable boon upon 
botanical collectors by so shaping his " Field- 
Book of American Wild Flowers " that when 
not in use it can be stowed away in a side- 
pocket and happily forgotten. But the book 
can boast of still higher qualities. It is writ- 
ten in plain English : that is, the Greek and 
Latin terms which make botany literally a 
science of hard words are almost wholly avoided, 
and their place is supplied by the simple Ian- 
guage to which we are all accustomed. One 
page of the book is given to written descrip- 
tions ; the opposite page pictures the plants 
described, in admirable drawings, occasionally 
with colors applied. Over eight hundred species 
of our wild flowers are thus delineated, reliev- 
ing the student of the toil of analysis in order 
to learn the name and character of the blossom 
he would identify. It is an easy and agreeable 
method of making friends of the flowers which 
greet one wherever there is soil enough to carry 
root and stem and leaf to their culmination. 
It might be called the lazy man's botany, — 
yet it will earn the gratitude of many a thorough 
worker in its field, who would gladly avail 
himself of helps that spare him labor and time. 

To those of us whose memory reaches back 
some decades more or less, there is a double 
delight in turning over the books which now-a- 
days come from an ambitious press. In the 
old times little was looked for beyond a plain 
binding and a sober page in the volumes which 
claimed our notice and found a place in staid 
rows on our library shelves. What a contrast 
prevails at the present day ! The prime appeal 
is still to the mental verdict, and yet the grati- 



fication of the eye is the first end sought. The 
assthetic sense is considered, and all that can 
win its approval is ingeniously attempted. 
Whatever art can devise is now employed to 
give outward charm to the book that covets our 
commendation. We feel this sensibly in the 
" talks about flowers," by Mrs. Frances Theo- 
dora Parsons, which she brings out in a new 
edition, retaining the former name " According 
to Season." One has a prolonged satisfaction 
in scanning without reading the pages, in dwell- 
ing upon the pictures alone and marking the 
refined details which lend them distinction. 
It is a privilege to own such a book for its ar- 
tistic charm. And its contents well deserve 
their setting. They form a sort of flower cal- 
endar, bringing into prominence the species 
which peculiarly mark the seasons from winter 
around to winter again. The writer is on in- 
timate terms with nature, familiar with her 
varied manifestations, and winning from her 
many secrets unknown to hasty or casual ob- 
servers. These secrets she imparts to the 
reader with an easy and confident air that is 
no small factor in the happy impression her 
book produces. 

In a series of short, light stories, written 
for the delectation of young children, the lat- 
ter are taken out " Among the Night People," 
by their popular entertainer, Mrs. Clara Dil- 
lingham Pierson, to witness the comedies and 
tragedies which these odd creatures enact while 
hid by the curtain of the dark. All the adven- 
tures thus brought to light are made known by 
the animals themselves, who talk to each other 
in unimpeachable English. Cut-worms, fire- 
flies, wigglers, weasels, raccoons, and the rest, 
exhibit a play of mental and moral faculties 
akin to those with which human beings are en- 
dowed. In fact they are simply men, women, 
and children, masquerading in fur and feathers, 
wings and claws, to fit the various parts they 
assume. Such tales are amusing, beyond a 
doubt ; but the question arises if the same pur- 
pose might not be attained by communicating 
more truthful ideas of the aims and motives 
prevailing in the animal world. 

Mrs. Martha McCulloch- Williams discloses 
an astonishing knowledge of the business of 
agriculture in the chronicles of a countryside 
to which she has given the title of "Next to 
the Ground." One might reasonably infer that 
she has had a life-long experience in turning 
the furrow, in sowing and harvesting crops, 
and in caring for the animals which are an 
essential adjunct of the farm. With minutest

detail she treats of ploughing, of clearing 
woodland, of conditions and effects of the 
weather, of the labors and the pastimes which 
are the portion of humble and isolated tillers 
of the soil. Separate chapters are devoted to 
the respective traits and manners of the hog, 
the cow, the horse, and the barn-yard fowls. 
Incidentally, birds, insects, and wild animals, 
which are most intimately associated with the 
farmer, are included in the careful description. 
A thread of story runs through the narrative, 
the scene of which is laid in Kentucky. 

Up in the northern part of Michigan, thirty 
years ago, there rested " a big, broad, beauti- 
ful sheet of water set down in the very heart 
of the woods." The banks were high and 
clothed with a noble growth of hardwood and 
evergreen trees ; the water itself was deep 
and clear, now blue under the cloudless heaven, 
and now gold as it basked in the sunshine. 
Here an explorer in the unbroken wilderness, 
captivated with the loveliness of the little lake, 
brought his family to dwell, and here for 
years they had for companionship only "forest 
neighbors " who came about them with un- 
suspecting familiarity and were treated with 
the kindliness of honest friendship. The squir- 
rels, woodchucks, chipmunks, and porcupines 
were daily or nightly visitors at the lonely 
cabin ; while the lynx, the bear, and the deer 
often ventured into the near vicinity. The 
beavers built their dams in the brooks flowing 
into the lake, and the loon and other water- 
fowl swam on its surface, plunged deep below 
for their diet of fish, and built their nests in 
its sheltered places. The boy growing up amid 
such isolated surroundings would naturally 
have many an interesting story to relate of 
the wild denizens living close about him ; and a 
store of these has been gathered into a volume 
by Mr. William Davenport Hulbert, who was 
one of the pioneer's young family settled on the 
shores of Grlimmerglass lake. In his account 
of his " Forest Neighbors " we see the animals 
as he saw them, in a state of nature, true to 
their instincts, and alive and intense in every 
act and impulse ; and we follow their career 
as he did, glad of their successes and grieved 
over the misfortunes of the humblest among 
them. 

Exquisite illustrations make "The Brook 
Book," by Miss Mary Rogers Miller, a thing 
to be coveted. The transcripts, in half-tone, 
of quiet landscapes with the brook always a 
central feature, are beautiful enough to frame 
and hang ever in view. Beside these there 



are copious line engravings of much delicacy 
and refinement. The text is a record of the 
rambles of a naturalist along a brookside in 
all weathers and at all seasons of the year. 
Everything alive invited her attention. The 
beauty of the scenery rouses her enthusiasm, 
but her raptures are chiefly expended upon the 
insects inhabiting the water, and the plants 
that fringe its borders. She is skilful in her 
discourse about them, withholding full descrip- 
tions and telling just enough to excite the 
reader's wish to know more, and, by following 
the writer's example, to find out for himself 
the facts that are missing in the half-unfolded 
tale. Miss Miller, as she reveals herself in her 
researches in the storehouse of nature, has an 
energetic personality, a vivacious and piquant 
habit which is a continual stimulant to the 
spectator. 

A book whose purpose is ethical as well as 
practical, which combines wisdom with instruc- 
tion, is that in which Dr. Clifton F. Hodge, as- 
sistant professor in Clark University, Worces- 
ter, Mass., outlines a system of " Nature Study 
and Life," having for its express aim the de- 
velopment of character, of the will to do good, 
of the power to create happiness. "Nature 
Study," he declares, " is learning those things in 
nature that are best worth knowing to the end 
of doing those things that make life most worth 
living." Of first importance are man's primitive 
relations to animal and plant life. Household 
pets are the earliest playfellows of the child; 
he should therefore begin his course of nature 
lessons with a study of the dog, the cat, the 
horse, the toad, the rabbit, the bird, which 
are daily under his eye, of which he knows 
something and should know everything that will 
stimulate his interest and sympathy and extend 
their service to him in ways of pleasure or of 
use. For the study of plants the author would 
have the child sow the seed and watch the growth 
until stem and leaf and flower beget seed in their 
turn. He adopts the motto of Mrs. Alice Free- 
man Palmer, "Give children large interests and 
give them young," and charges it with a benefi- 
cent motive for their future benefit. " If the 
boys of a neighborhood make the raising of 
peaches and grapes impossible, a better remedy 
than the jail would be to start them to raising 
peaches and grapes of their own." In the study 
of insects, Dr. Hodge would have the child take 
these which are near at hand, — the fly, the 
mosquito, the cockroach, the moth, — and, leav- 
ing to specialists details of structure and clas- 
sification, learn its life-history by direct obser-

vation. The child who has noted the conditions 
of development in one of the lower animals has 
gained a dominion over it which will enable 
him in maturity to subject it to his needs and 
comfort. The mere knowledge attained is a 
secondary thing. Its worth consists in the con- 
trol it insures over inferior tribes which tend to 
become a pleasure or a pest to mankind. Here- 
in lies the distinction of Dr. Hodge's system. 
The child discovers the practical value of the 
work he is pursuing, and rejoices in it accord- 
ingly. Beauty and utility go hand in hand, 
and he is willing to toil and sacrifice in order 
to produce results whereby the good is cherished 
and the evil is overcome. The book is intended 
largely for teachers or parents, and will be es- 
teemed by them for its felicitous and compre- 
hensive suggestions. Sara A. Hubbard. 



The Book of the Trout.* 



The popularity of the brook trout among 
American anglers is so thoroughly established 
that it requires the ceaseless and unstinted 
beneficence of a paternal government to keep 
our streams stocked with the speckled fry. 
The deforestation of great tracts of wilderness, 
and the devastation by fire with resultant 
destruction of insect life, have brought addi- 
tional peril to the inhabitants of many a trout 
stream. The pollutions of civilization, from 
sawdust to sewage, have already spread deso- 
lation in many an angler's paradise. 

We fear very much that Mr. Ehead's book 
of "The Speckled Brook Trout" will only 
increase the terrors that await poor Salvelinus 
of the spring-fed streams. It will stir the 
blood of every veteran disciple of Izaak of 
Stafford, and inspire the amateurs to test the 
charms of the Beaverkill. The book is the 
first of a series which is to constitute a " Li- 
brary of Eod and Gun," and it is eminently 
fitting that the brook trout should receive the 
place of chief totem in this religion of recre- 
ation ; for, as the book puts it, — 

" Has he not stimulated a love for nature, made men 
good, virtuous, and humane? Given occupation to idlers, 
lured loafers from demoralizing environment, filled 
libraries with poetry, helles lettres, and an angling biblio- 
graphy as unique as it is entertaining? Has he not, in 
fact, been a potential instrument to distribute popula-

tion over the wilderness places, and so filled up the 
Arcadian recesses of the Catskills, the Adirondacks, 
the White Mountains, the Appalachians, the Rockies, 
and the Cascades, with cottages, parks, and summer 
hotels, where the worker and wage-earner may rest from 
their labors and the butterflies of fashion find a health- 
ful and aesthetic elysium ? " 

The first object of the editor was to supply 
general information concerning the brook trout, 
without technical terms, for the average fisher- 
man who is interested in angling only as a sport 
or as a change from the activity of city life 
and business cares. This result is very well 
achieved in spite of the fact that the book is a 
series of articles by no less than eight different 
authors. The unity of purpose is well sus- 
tained throughout, and a comprehensive and 
well-balanced treatise is the result. Mr. Hal- 
lock writes a general description of the trout 
family, and Mr. Wm. C. Harris speaks from 
long acquaintance of the habits of this wary 
fish. We fear that neither geologists nor 
ichthyologists will give wide acceptance to Mr. 
Hallock's suggestion that the wide distribution 
of trout is to be explained by their transit 
through the limpid waters of an extensive sub- 
terranean fluvial system. Mr. E. D. T. Cham- 
bers describes the famous big trout of the

Kent sets forth the charms of the Beaverkill. 
The old Adirondacks, as they were before they 
fell from the "estate of fish and solitude" for 
which they were originally celebrated, are con- 
trasted with the new Adirondacks, in which 
sportsmen's secrets have become the common- 
places of the guide-books. Mr. F. Annin, Jr., 
details the various winged foes with which the 
trout must contend for existence, and presents 
a long list of offenders. The other contributors 
are free to express their views of intruding 
sawmills, and of farmers who also interfere 
with the angler's sport. We fear the editor 
has let pass a good opportunity to set forth in 
his true light one of the greatest enemies both 
of the trout and the modest angler, to-wit, the 
expert who fishes for record and whips out a 
brook in a single day regardless of the pleasure 
of others or the maintenance of the sport. A 
chapter by the late A. Nelson Cheney, on the 
propagation of trout, is reprinted from the re- 
port of the New York commissioners ; and 
some notes on cooking brook trout are furnished 
by the editor.

Recent Fiction.* 



The instinct of hero-worship is a fine psycholog- 
ical possession when restrained by a due regard for 
truth. There are no heroes without their faults, 
and we need to have the robust faith which accepts 
a hero, faults and all, without blinking, if our cult 
is to gain converts. When misdeeds are glazed by 
the worshipper, and the unlovely aspects of char- 
acter concealed, the portrait drawn is not convincing, 
and its effect is not what the artist intends. Alex- 
ander Hamilton achieved enough of real greatness to 
bear the exposure of all his defects, but Mrs. Ather- 
ton, who has just made him the subject of a sort of 
historical novel, is determined that he shall have 
the stature of a demigod, and is unwilling to admit 
that his conduct shall be measured by the ordinary 
moral standards. We have styled " The Con- 
queror " a sort of historical novel because, while 
largely fictitious, it reads like serious history. The 
writer says that she at first thought of writing a 
formal biography of Hamilton, but " the instinct of 
the novelist proved too strong " to be overcome. The 
actual result of her efforts is a hybrid product that 
is not easily classified. The long historical and 
constitutional disquisitions which impede its progress 
make it impossible to call the work a novel pure 
and simple, while the false coloring of its hero's

character and the unworthy caricaturing of all his 
political opponents, forbid us to take it as a his- 
torical study. Mrs. Atherton has studied the sources 
widely if not wisely, but the resulting product is a 
turgid and amorphous piece of writing, absolutely 
hopeless in the matter of style, as well as insuffer- 
ably dull. The historical student will find in it 
entertainment of a sort that the writer did not in- 
tend to provide, but the general reader will do well 
to pass it by. 

" The Battleground " is the fourth novel of Miss 
Ellen Glasgow, and is much the best of the four. 
Indeed, it seems to us one of the best novels of the 
South during the period which precedes and includes 
the Civil War that has ever been written. The 
generous qualities and the amiable weaknesses that 
make the Virginia life of a generation ago so charm- 
ing to us in the retrospect are pictured with sym- 
pathetic insight, and the horrors of internecine 
conflict are softened into pathetic outline by the art 
of the writer. The broad hospitality, the essential 
refinement, the semi-feudal social organization, and 
the high-minded idealism of the Old Dominion in 
ante-bellum days, are now ♦vanished forever from 
our civilization, or exist in out-of-the-way regions 
as faint simulacra of a past that now seems as old 
as the Flood. We have organized our life upon a 
more rational basis, perhaps, but much has been 
lost that may never be regained, and one sometimes 
wonders if the change has been altogether for the 
better. This book might have been called " The 
Making of a Man," for that is what provides its 
main interest, and we care more for the develop- 
ment of the hero's character under the stress of 
sternly adverse circumstance than we do for the 
picturesque accessories of the narrative. The war 
itself is excellently done, but even more excellent is 
the art with which its reactions upon the several 
leading characters are set forth. Such books as 
this help us to respect the Southern standpoint, and 
help also to wipe away the last lingering traces of 
Northern resentment.

chosen for her field the wild days of adventure in 
the Canadian wilderness, the days when the far- 
trade was a source of great wealth to those who 
exploited it, and when the rivalries of English and 
French for its monopoly led to many moving inci- 
dents by flood and forest. Miss Laut's " Lords of 
the North" was a work of much freshness and 
crude power, and its present successor, "Heralds 
of Empire," marks a still more evident success. 
That picturesque and fascinating dare-devil, Pierre 
Radisson, is the hero of the new romance, which 
connects, on the one hand, with the English court 
of the Restoration, and, on the other, with the 
colony of Massachusetts Bay just before the days 
of the witchcraft delusion. 

We are plunged into the thick of the witchcraft 
delusion when we take up "The Coast of Freedom," 
by Miss Marie Adele Shaw. The scene of this ro- 
mance begins at the London docks, with the kidnap- 
ping of a maid whom certain villainous persons wish 
to put out of the way that they may gain possession 
of her property. The scene then shifts (after a 
piratical episode) to the New England colony, 
whither the heroine is brought under the guardian- 
ship of Captain William Phips. The arch-villain 
also appears to ornament Boston society, and prose- 
cute his designs. A suitable hero is provided, and, 
after many perils, both hero and heroine reach the 
haven of their desires. The leading historical fig- 
ures are those of Phips, now governor of the colony, 
and Cotton Mather, in his favorite character of 
witch-hunter. It is probably useless to protest, in 
the name of historical scholarship, against this dis- 
tortion of a great New England worthy. The scene 
of the heroine's trial for witchcraft is well done, 
much better than it has been done in earlier treat- 
ments of this theme, and the general atmosphere of 
Puritan Massachusetts has been reproduced with 
considerable skill and fidelity to fact. 

Mr. Wymond Carey is a new writer, as far as we 
know, and the quality of his "Monsieur Martin" 
is such that we shall hope to hear from him again. 
The book is a full-blooded historical romance of 
the great Swedish war, with Charles XII. for the 
leading historical figure, and Augustus the Strong 
for a side-show. A scene is divided between Sweden 
and Dresden, and the interest is sustained at stir- 
ring pitch throughout an exceptionally long narra- 
tive. The intrigue is so complicated that we follow 
it with difficulty, and even at the end are not quite 
sure of what the author would have us think of 
several of his characters. This is the one defect of 
a book which has many virtues. It is the product 
of a rich mind and an inventive one, of a writer 
who has really delved into the history of his period, 
and who at the same time knows how to make skil- 
ful use of all the romantic accessories. It is a novel 
of action from first to last, and spares us the pages 
of description and analysis with which most histor- 
ical romances are apt to eke out the poverty of their 
imagination. 

The romantic career of John Law has been made 



into a historical novel by Mr. Emerson Hough, 
who has found ample material for his exploitation 
in the experiences of this fascinating adventurer. 
Roughly divided, the story has three sections, deal- 
ing, respectirely, with Law's startling entry into 
London society, with his subsequent exploration of 
the Mississippi Valley, and with his dazzling fame 
and sudden downfall under the French Regency. 
His life offers an excellent subject for romance, 
and the author has made much of it. The specu- 
lative fever which attended the launching of his 
great financial enterprises, his conquest of court 
and capital, and the dramatic climax of his down- 
fall, are vividly set forth, and inspire no little 
sympathy for a man who, although he made mis- 
calculations, was nevertheless distinctly in advance 
of his age. 

" The Siege of Lady Resolute," by Mr. Harris 
Dickson, is a historical romance which, like the one 
last described, divides its scenes between Europe and 
America. It begins in Southern France, with the 
persecution of the C^venol Huguenots, carries us on 
through much intrigue in and about the court of 
Louis XIV., and depicts the sinister ascendency of 
Madame de Maintenon. Presently the action is 
shifted to the new colony of Louisiana, whither hero 
and heroine are conveniently transported, and where 
they encounter much peril from both red men and 
white. We return to France at last, and the Lady 
Resolute capitulates, which means that there is no 
further excuse for prolonging the story. 

The latest of Revolutionary romances is " None 
but the Brave," by Mr. Hamblen Sears. The scene 
is laid in the Hudson region, from West Point to 
New York, and the time is that of Arnold's treason 
and the immediately subsequent happenings. The 
figures are of the conventional sort. The hero is 
daring and devoted ; the heroine begins by being 
pert and ends by becoming womanly ; Washington, 
Arnold, Andr^, Clinton, and other historical per- 
sonages make also their conventional albeit shadowy 
entry upon the scene. The villain is disposed of 
in somewhat unusual fashion, and all ends happily. 

The history of the last century offers no subject 
for the historical novelist more fascinating in its 
interest and more striking in its dramatic possibilities 
than the war of 1870 between France and Prussia. 
A number of writers have made successful use of 
this theme. It has been happily handled by Herr 
Spielhagen in his " Allzeit Voran," by Mr. R. W. 
Chambers in his "Lorraine," and by countless 
French novelists of the past quarter- century. This 
is no reason why it should not be handled again, 
and we are glad that Mr. Chatfield-Taylor has 
taken it for the subject-matter of his latest novel. 
We are glad, not only because of the perennial in- 
terest of the theme, but also because it has given 
this writer an opportunity for the display of talents 
that could not possibly find fitting exercise in the 
drawing-room. The smartness of an artificial so- 
ciety has been his chief preoccupation in his earlier 
novels, and he has cared more for the polishing of

a phrase than for the delineation of a vital situation. 
Epigram and light social banter are not wholly 
missing in " The Crinason Wing," but there is serious 
stuff besides. It is all a little theatrical and senti- 
mental still, but it is a well-planned story, and it is 
based upon a really painstaking effort to be his- 
torically accurate. It is a far better book than the 
author has heretofore given us, and promises well 
for his literary future. 

" Before the Dawn," a novel by Mr. and Mrs. 
Edmund Noble, deals with the beginnings of the 
modern revolutionary movement in Russia. The 
scene is laid somewhere in the early seventies, when 
Nihilism was on the point of blossoming into the 
red flower of terrorism, and when the ferment of 
liberal ideas was spreading from many small groups 
of young men and women. The authors know their 
Russia too well to be guilty of going to sensational 
extremes, and the lurid episodes usually found in 
stories of this description are wanting. There are 
arrests, indeed, and sentences of administrative 
exile, but we are spared the horrors of dungeons 
and assassinations. The book is valuable as a picture 
of social conditions, bat it does not make a good 
novel. The action is impeded by much description 
and discussion, and even the plot is difficult to dis- 
entangle. We have at the end only a confused idea 
of the principal characters and of the relations in 
which the authors have sought to place them. 

The " epic " effect seems in danger of being over- 
strained by our novelists. One of them gives us 
the epic of the wheat and promises the epic of the 
board of trade, another gives us the epic of the 
rolling-mills, and still another the epic of the cow- 
boy ; now Mr. Stewart Edward White appears with 
" The Blazed Trail," which is the epic of the log- 
ging camp. These books all testify to the tremen- 
dous energy which is the secret of our material 
advancement, and doubtless help the cloistered 
reader to understand the conditions of the turbulent 
life that environs him. But they make rather dull 
reading, because their chief stock in trade is a fund 
of technical information about some particular in- 
dustry, which cannot be accepted as a proper sub- 
stitute for insight into the human soul. Mr. White's 
book is among the better of its class, but it is heavily 
overweighted with minute realistic description, and 
the relief afforded by a few sentimental episodes and 
rhapsodical outbursts is too artificial and perfunctory 
to prove satisfactory. Those who want to know 
about logging in Upper Michigan, and about the 
frauds upon the government committed by the 
lumberman-capitalist, will find these things expressed 
with virile energy in " The Blazed Trail," but they 
will find little more. Least of all will they find 
the elements of convincing or even probable romance, 
unless the meaning of romance be frankly adapted 
to fit the case. 

Mr. Hamlin Garland has produced a capital story 
in "The Captain of the Gray Horse Troop." It is 
a story of love and adventure on a Western Indian 
reservation, with an excursion or two into the haunts 



of the Eastern politician. It has a hero of the most 
attractive metal, sincere and courageous, and a 
heroine who charms not the hero alone. It has 
moving incidents in profusion, and opportunities for 
the display of both moral and physical prowess. It 
has descriptive power also, and a charm of style 
beyond what Mr. Garland has hitherto attained. 
It is, moreover, a book which makes an impressive 
appeal in behalf of a cause which has clearly en- 
listed the author's most ardent sympathies — the 
cause of the American Indian. Mr. Garland has 
been apt to let his interest in causes get the better 
of his artistic judgment, but in this case he has 
made a book which does not suffer in romantic in 
terest from the obtrusion of the underlying argu 
ment. With less of sentimentality and a firmer 
grasp of actual conditions than were possessed by 
the author of " Ramona," he has made an even 
more convincing plea for the rights of our national 
wards, and has voiced an equal indignation at sight 
of the tricks and abuses that we have allowed to 
be put upon them, at our wanton provocations and 
punitive expeditions, and at the folly of the effort 
to impose our own civilization upon a people who 
are still living in the Stone Age. " The Captain 
of the Gray Horse Troop " is a well-informed and 
warm-hearted book, that is good to read, and is 
likely to prove an effective ally in the work of 
dealing justly and humanely with the Indians. 

The delicate art of Mr. Howells has never 
been displayed to better advantage than in his 
latest novel. " The Kentons " is the kind of story 
best suited to his powers, a story of commonplace 
people in commonplace relations. The characters 
are the six Kentons — father, mother, two daugh- 
ters, and two sons — and the various young men 
who are interested in the daughters. They live in 
an Ohio town of five thousand inhabitants, and 
enjoy universal respect. Muskingum, however, does 
not long contain them, as far as the present story is 
concerned, for one of the daughters gets into an 
entanglement of the affections with a vulgar youth 
of the town, and is broken-hearted when she real- 
izes his unworthiness. To distract her, the family 
make a visit to New York, and thence s^,art upon 
a European trip. The objective point is Holland^ 
and the scene from that time on is laid in the Hague 
and in Scheveningen. A young New York clergy- 
man of the liberal and humane type is among their 
fellow-passengers ; he accompanies them to the 
Hague, and, in the end, persuades the broken- 
hearted daughter to become his wife. These charac- 
ters are drawn for us with lines so deft and so subtle 
that we can think of no truer parallel than the work 
of Jane Austen. In addition, there is much variety 
of incident, and the constant infusion of the sly 
humor which Mr. Howells always has at command. 
The heroine is a young woman with an exasperating 
conscience, which we all the time fear will compel 
her to a rash decision, reckless of her own inter- 
ests. Fortunately, her fundamental good sense 
triumphs over the casuistry of her introspective 



388

heart-searchings, and the situation is brought to a 
rational outcome. The perplexities of the story 
are of the artificial sort, and in the hands of the 
ordinary novelist such a story could not be any- 
thing but dull. To say that it remains absorbingly 
interesting is the best tribute that we can pay to 
the art of the writer. 

Religious controversy in a small New York town 
is the substance of " Hardwicke," by Mr. Henry 
Edward Rood. This is not a promising programme, 
but the treatment offers a sufficient modicum of 
variety and humor to reconcile us in the end with 
so forbidding a theme. The principal character is 
a young clergyman, whose faith in the fundamentals 
of Christian belief is unshaken, but who has read 
and thought too much to have any sympathy with 
the narrow and intolerant orthodoxy of the past. 
In accepting his village charge he finds himself a 
member of a community bound hard and fast in 
the trammels of a mechanical and repellant faith. 
His opinions quickly arouse suspicion, and he finds 
himself, after a few weeks, the victim of an old- 
fashioned heretic hunt, with the whole village pack 
at his heels. The plot of his enemies to dismiss him 
in disgrace is shrewdly circumvented, and he with- 
draws voluntarily with most of the honors of the 
game, including the daughter of his most virulent 
antagonist. The story is rather amateurish, the 
violence of the attack upon the hero is somewhat 
exaggerated, and certain minor features of the plot 
are not sufficiently developed, but the book is never- 
theless possessed of both interest and promise. 

A young man of fine intellectual and moral en- 
dowment, entering upon active life with all the 
advantages of wealth and education, resolves, rather 
than follow the easy path of worldly success that 
invites him, to cast in his lot with the poor and 
make their cause his own. He first enters the 
ministry, but is soon repelled by the hypocrisies of 
the profession, and decides to become one of the 
people by engaging as a common workman in a 
great iron and steel industry. With this purpose 
in view he enters the works of an establishment, 
makes his way into a position of some responsibility, 
and at the same time becomes a trusted leader of 
his fellow-workmen in their agitation for the redress 
of grievances. In the strike which ensues, he en- 
deavors to mediate between the conflicting interests, 
but stands staunchly for the claims of labor in its 
conflict with capital. The angry passions which he 
has helped to unloose escape from his control, and 
there follows the familiar and sickening sequence 
of violent attacks upon property and persons, stern 
repression by the authorities, and punishment of 
the offenders. Having made his experiment, and 
found it a failure, he returns to the life which he 
had abandoned, not hopeless of his cause, but con- 
scious that he had sought to further it by means 
that must be foredoomed to failure. Henceforth, 
he will work for his ideal of the cooperative com- 
monwealth from the vantage-point of the social 
station to which he really belongs. The story is a 



familiar one ; once started, it almost tells itself ; in 
relating it anew, Mr. I. K. Friedman has followed 
the inevitable lines. But " By Bread Alone " is 
distinguished from most of the stories of its class 
by a patient first-hand study of the conditions of 
the problem, by passionate earnestness, and by 
perfect sincerity. These qualities have their defects, 
which in the present instance take the form of too 
much technology and a seriousness too unre- 
lieved. Those who are familiar with industrial 
conditions in the great iron mills of Chicago will 
applaud the faithfulness of their portrayal, and 
those who remember the incidents of the riots of 
the summer of 1894 will admire the ingenuity with 
which Mr. Friedman has made use of material 
drawn from its history. His reproduction of the 
happenings of that summer is so accurate in many 
of its details that there is danger of its being taken 
too literally in others. In this respect, an unin- 
tentional injustice is done the memory of a recent 
governor of Illinois, whose real attitude in the 
matter was that of unflinching determination to 
sustain the law, rather thtjb that sympathy with 
lawlessness which has beedr^harged to him by his 
enemies. We regret that Mr. Friedman's book 
should help to perpetuate so malicious and un- 
grounded a legend. 

" The Second Generation," by Mr. James Weber 
Linn, is the first book of a youfng writer, who has 
done wisely in dealing with life as it lies close at 
hand. It is a study of the modern American city 
viewed by a student of corrupt political conditions, 
and pictures the career of an unscrupulous manip- 
ulator of legislative bodies and organs of opihilfl^ 
To the undoing of this scoundrel a young reporter^ 
devotes his energies, and achieves success in his 
aim, although the caprice of fortune makes him the 
victim of an unjust criminal prosecution. With the 
daughter of this man, ignorant of her parentage, 
he has fallen in love, and thus the outcome of the 
story is a sort of tragedy. Mr. Linn has written a 
creditable story, one which has interest in itself, and 
which gives promise of better things to come. 

"Catholic controversy in fiction" — the adver- 
tisement is not alluring, but it is at|least honest. 
Three books constitute the series, and one of them 
we reviewed several weeks ago. " The Catholic " 
is an anonymous novel, dealing with contemporary 
English life. The form of worship, about which 
the characters and incidents are grouped, seems to 
have no relation whatever to any form of religious 
emotion. It is a hard and unlovely polity, seeking 
to extend its power by worldly influence and in- 
trigue, by an appeal to the baser motives of human 
action. There is not a character in the book that 
may be called sympathetic, nor an ambition that 
may be called praiseworthy. If the writer be 
indeed a member of the Roman communion, his 
method is certainly a curious one. The best of 
ecclesiastical organizations have vices that are in 
need of scourging, but the role of the candid friend 
may easily be overacted.

Mr. Richard Bagot, whose " Casting of Nets " 
we mentioned before, has now added " A Roman 
Mystery " to the series. His second book is much 
better than the first, which we condemned on much 
the same grounds as have just been urged in the 
case of " The Catholic." It has no more of spir- 
ituality than its predecessor, and it gives disagree- 
able prominence to the intriguing and proselytizing 
aspects of Catholic society, but it deals with inter- 
esting material, and is the work of a man who 
knows his subject. That subject is, essentially, the 
feud between "whites" and "blacks" in Roman 
society, of which Mr. Crawford has given us many 
interesting glimpses, and which Mr. Bagot has 
studied with judgment and penetration. His book 
is a brief for the liberals, and an unanswerable 
argument for the renunciation of papal pretensions 
to the temporal power. 

Dr. Conan Doyle would have done well to adhere 
to his earlier resolution, and allow Sherlock Holmes 
to " stay dead." The resurrection was hardly worth 
while if it was to result in so hackneyed a repetition 
of the old mannerisms and methods of the detective 
as is given us in " The Hound of the Baskervilles." 
The plot is ingeniously contrived, to be sure, and 
the working out is of a nature to keep the reader 
keyed up to a reasonable pitch of exciting suspense, 
but the conclusion is not adequate to the machinery 
employed, and the entire performance is hopelessly 
melodramatic. When we think of the really good 
books that Dr. Doyle wrote at the outset of his career, 
and then contrast them with this journeyman effort, 
the showing is melancholy indeed. 

"The Giant's Gate," Mr. Max Pemberton's latest 
injjention, is a romance of modern Paris inspired by 
suggestions of the Dreyfus affair, and partly by 
reminiscences of the meteoric General Boulanger. 
What the author needed was a " man on horseback," 
the idol of the populace, and, since the more recent 
■chapter in French history failed to provide such a 
figure, recourse was had to the earlier one. A coup 
d'Stat is planned, and gives promise of successful 
issue, but the Government thwarts the conspirators 
at the critical juncture, and the hero occupies Bel- 
fort instead of the Elyede. The heroine is the 
daughter of an English earl, and, at the end, is left 
awaiting the release of her lover from the place of 
his imprisonment. The story is brilliant but artifi- 
cial, and, what is unusual with this novelist, is badly 
constructed. The " giant's gate " is the Thames, 
and the whole tenor of the earlier chapters seems to 
promise a French invasion of England by means of 
a fleet of submarines. About midway in the narra- 
tive, the plot gets sidetracked, as it were, and from 
there on becomes an account of the hero's imperial 
escapade. A curious thing about the book is that, in 
dealing with its English scenes and persons, it as- 
sumes the French standpoint, and indulges in the 
sort of caricature which is the delight of the Par- 
isian journalist. We cannot help wondering how 
Mr. Pemberton's public will take this audacious 
proceeding. William Morton Payne. 



NOTES ON NOVELS. 



Mr. Brand Whitlock was long a political corres- 
pondent for one of the leading newspapers in the coun- 
try. During his period of service he obtained an 
insight into the practical side of government which is 
granted to few of his fellow-citizens. This he has 
utilized to the utmost in his novel, " The Thirteenth 
District " (Bowen-Merrill Co.). But he has not rested 
content with the mere idealizing and narration of events 
from his own experience. Singularly happy as he has 
been in selecting characters who are types of the con- 
tending forces ruling the destinies of the Republic, he 
has been still happier in making his principal character, 
a pitiful creature to call a hero, the battle-ground on 
which the forces of good and evil contend. The de- 
moralizing effects of power in weak hands, of life in 
the capital of the nation upon a character far from 
robust, of the temptations which assail the man in 
public life, these are what give Mr. Whitlock's work its 
interest and its promise of permanency. 

Politics of quite another sort gives interest to Mr. 
Joel Chandler Harris's initial tale in " The Making of 
a Statesman, and Other Stories" (McClure, Phillips & 
Co.). Here a young man of talent and high ambitions 
sacrifices his own career to put the father of the girl 
he loves into a place of honor, — writing his speeches, 
teaching him to deliver them, and conducting the cam- 
paigns that bring him before the public. Before it is 
quite too late, though after the supposed statesman's 
death, the lover's self-sacrifice becomes known to the 
daughter, and a pleasant story is given its appropriate 
ending. There are three other tales in the book, of 
the sort that Mr. Harris has made his readers familiar 
with in his previous publications, with well-drawn 
characters from the South, and events filled with 
human interest. 

In the general search for literary material now going 
on in America, the South is by no means overlooked. 
Mr. Thomas Dixon, Jr., takes the Reconstruction era 
for the topic of his rather ill-natured work, " The 
Leopard's Spots" (Doubleday, Page & Co.). The 
author states Ag&in and again that the bittei^ness against 
the North is due more to the excesses of the " carpet- 
hag " epoch than to the deeds of the Civil War. He 
is full of hatred against the negro, who was rather the 
tool in the hands of designing whites than an actor on 
his own responsibility in the scenes complained of. 
Yet his book will not have been written in vain if it 
points out the dangers of ruling a people against its 
will, the awful perils of governing without the consent 
of the governed. 

A book more just to both North and South is Mrs. 
Mary Tappan Wright's " Aliens " (Scribner). A 
Northern man, long acclimated in the South through 
his service as professor in a small college, marries a 
Northern woman with all the virtues and prejudices of 
the intelligent American of New England birth and 
breeding. She brings to her understanding of the 
negro question a keen sense of justice and an inexor- 
able conscience. Opposed to her is the inertia of a 
people who have learned from bitter experience what 
she has seen with unfamiliar eyes. The right and 
wrong of the case, the slow dawning of the vital dis- 
tinction between a condition and a theory, are set forth 
with dispassion and a keen sense of justice to the con- 
tending forces at work. It is doubtful if the multiform 
problem presented by the Southern negro has ever been 



390 



THE DIAL 



[June 1, 



discussed in a manner more enlightened and with 
observation more acute. 

It is not in the « black belt " of the South that 
Miss Hildegard Brooks lays the scene of " The Master 
of Caxton " (Scribner), a story which concerns itself 
chiefly with social distinctions between the whites. A 
Southern girl, adopted by a woman of wealth in the 
North, abandons her heritage after the death of her 
benefactress, in part because of the burdens attached 
to it, but more from homesickness. She thenceforth 
makes her home with the three brothers she had never 
forgotten, young men with all the dignity of free Ameri- 
cans, though by no means of the aristocracy of their 
little corner in the world. A double romance runs 
through the story thenceforth, lending interest and va- 
riety to its well-drawn pictures of manners and customs. 
" Dorothy South " (Lothrop) takes its name from 
a beautiful young Southern woman, one of the most 
agreeable characters Mr. George Gary Eggleston has 
ever painted. The period is that immediately preceding 
the Civil War, and the story is concerned chiefly with 
the differences and contrasts between life in the South 
now and in the ante-bellum days. 

Still another aspect of Southern life is contained in 
" Mazel " (Stone), written by an author who shields his 
identity behind the pen-name of *• Richard Fisguill." 
The scene is laid in the University of Virginia, and the 
close approximation to actual portraits of the members 
of the faculty of that excellent institution will account 
for the practical anonymity with which the book is put 
forth. 

Mr. Samuel Minturn Peck is at his best in the series 
of little stories which make up the volume of " Ala- 
bama Sketches " (McClurg). He has drawn upon all 
the elements of a cheerful little city for his characters, 
and his work lacks neither humor nor pathos. Whites 
and blacks mingle in his pages on terms of equal liter- 
ary importance, whatever their social status may be. 
While slight, the tales, some of them little more than 
anecdotes, have positive charm, and may be taken as 
accurate pictures of a civilization but little known in 
the North. 

Mr. Paul. Dunbar has done nothing as good in prose 
as his latest story, " The Sport of the Gods " (Dodd, 
Mead & Co.). A faithful negro is accused of a crime 
of which his master's weak brother is guilty, and is 
sentenced to a long term of imprisonment. His family, 
denied the right of support through popular prejudice, 
takes refuge in New York City, and proceeds to speedy 
moral disintegration. Mr. Dunbar gives a side of met- 
ropolitan life almost unsuspected, — that of the dissi- 
pated colored folk, frequenters of saloons and cheap 
theatres. The story is at once tenderly sympathetic 
and powerful, and nothing written recently presents a 
more impressive picture of the evil results which fol- 
low a betrayal of justice. 

Nearly all the characters of Mr. Robert Shackleton's 
" Many Waters " (Appleton) are New York journalists, 
and those who seek knowledge of one of the few mod- 
ern occupations which have in them the spirit of adven- 
ture can find it set forth here in full detail. Episodes 
in newspaper life are to be seen from the inside, coupled 
with a pretty romance and an excellently contrived foil 
to it through the wrecking of a husband's life by an 
unfaithful wife. The book is vivid and convincing, and 
has a really remarkable first chapter. 

The city policeman, one of the most maligned and 
least understood of all our public servants, finds a sym- 



pathetic interpreter in Mr. Elliott Flower. " Police- 
man Flynn," the hero of his book, is an actuality in the 
main, based upon the long career of uninterrupted use- 
fulness led by the late Andrew Rowan of the Central 
Detail in Chicago. Mr. Flower lets us see what it 
means to be both a man and an officer, in a series of 
sketches, humorous in the main, though always with a 
suspicion of pathos. The book is eminently modern, 
and one to be read for instruction hardly less than 
amusement. (Century Co.) 

Not the least remarkable thing about Mark Twain's 
" Double-Barrelled Detective Story " (Harper) is the 
introduction into the book of Dr. Conan Doyle's " Sher- 
lock Holmes " as a living character, — just at the mo- 
ment, too, when his creator had resuscitated him. The 
story, which is slight, promises well in the opening chap- 
ters, but it may be said not to be worked out, and leaves 
the reader disappointed. 

An interesting character is preserved in Mr. Herbert 
M. Hopkins's "The Fighting Bishop" (Bo wen-Merrill 
Co.), a portrait of a pro-slavery prelate in war times, 
disclosing the effect of his powerful personality upon 
the members of his large family. There are two love 
episodes in the book, one of much sweetness; but the 
theme is rather the manner in which son after son of 
the aging man is crushed into insignificance under his 
dominion. Some rebel and flee, some dare to differ 
from him politically, even his wife turns to save her 
offspring from the terror of his wrath ; while the old 
dignitary, abating no whit of his demand for obedience, 
goes on his way lonely and sorrowful. For a first book, 
it has marked originality. 

As a result of his studies of the American tramp, 
Mr. Josiah Flynt has written a novel dealing with a spe- 
cial phase in the lives of these victims and enemies of 
society. " The Little Brother " (Century Co ) is not 
pleasant in text or suggestion, but it demands a meas- 
ure of social justice that shall free the community of 
these parasites by destroying the reason for their exist- 
ence. Here a child is kidnapped from his putative 
sister, actually his mother, and the kidnapper proves in 
the end to be the lad's own father. A chapter, drawn 
from life, of the effect of jail-life upon the boy, reads 
like a cry for help from these helpless ones. 

The mining region of Arizona has furnished Miss 
Frances Charles with the material for her rather unus- 
ual story, " In the Country God Forgot " (Little, 
Brown, & Co.). On this rude spot the civilizations of 
the Atlantic coast meet the customs of the remote 
Southwest, with effects at once humorous and tragic. 
In the background stands the gloomy figure of a pio- 
neer, owner of all the neighboring lands and interests 
not wholly mineral, who has in his heart a most unhappy 
hatred for his only child, a son. The book can hardly 
be said to be composed of successive episodes, and yet 
the bond between the chapters is often slight, making 
it difficult to hold the thread of the argument. 

New England humor may grow tiresome when 
strained through the medium of much dialect, so that 
the better part of Mr. Fred Lewis Pattee's " Mary Gar- 
vin: The Story of a New Hampshire Summer " (Crow- 
ell) lies rather in the awakening of soul which comes 
to the heroine, at first through her growing affection 
for a man of education, a neighbor's son, who has sought 
and found a position at the bar, and then in the abrupt- 
ness of her own contrast with the personality of a 
charming city woman looking for a rural retreat. Be- 
tween the two influences, she comes into contact with

the great world, goes to school, — and the end is inev- 
itable, but all the better for coming after a good old- 
fashioned New England Thanksgiving dinner. 

There are few writers more entertaining to-day than 
Miss Josephine Dodge Daskam, and her previous rep- 
utation loses nothing by the stories of childhood pub- 
lished under the title of the first of them, " The Mad- 
ness of Philip" (McClure, Phillips & Co.). Miss 
Daskam has been at no little pains to present aspects 
of child-life which are typical, and to the adult unusu- 
ally instructive. She has fully realized in her book 
that children have ideas and standards of their own, 
and has been fortunate in making this fact clear to her 
readers. It is a rare story that can bring amusement 
to both old and young in a single audience. 

A child of a larger growth is the heroine of Miss 
Eleanor Hoyt's " The Misdemeanors of Nancy " (Dou- 
bleday, Page & Co.). Nancy is a girl just old enough 
to be in society, pretty, charming, acute, and vivacious, 
and with entire consciousness of the privileges these 
qualities entitle her to exact from the world at large 
and from the masculine element in it more particularly. 
The book is admirable summer reading, being con- 
structed in episodes, each complete in itself, yet com- 
bining to give an accurate portrait of a delightful 
personality. 

««Chimmie Fadden and Mr Paul" (Century Co.) 
revives interest in an old acquaintance, the " Bowery 
boy," promoted to service in a New York family of 
position and wealth. All the characters of the former 
volume have been retained by Mr. Townsend, the 
author, but the opinions set forth in the book are 
largely those of Mr. Paul, intimate in the Van Cort- 
landt-Burton household. Strained as these are through 
Chimmie's marvellous dialect, the effect is usually de- 
lightful if the ability to comprehend this picturesque 
manner of expression is not lacking. But the notable 
thing in the book is the social and political philosophy, 
quite as good and quite as sound in its way as Mr. 
Dooley's, and of the same school. 

Of the making of historical romances there is appar- 
ently no end, but if all of these could have the fire and 
accuracy of Mr. Clinton ScoUard's " The Cloistering 
of Ursula " (L. C. Page & Co.) there would be noth- 
ing to complain of. The scene is laid in one of the 
Italian cities during the Renaissance, and the opening 
chapter is certain to engage the reader's attention, for 
the hero's whole family perishes in a single massacre. 
From that time on there is no diminution of interest, 
love stepping in when battle and murder is not holding 
the stage. It is an accurate picture of the times, ad- 
mirably written, and well illustrated. 

Going back to the days of the Emperor Barbarossa 
for the scene of " HohenzoUern," the Very Rev. Cyrus 
Townsend Brady has drawn upon his imagination for 
the rest of his characters. The book is written for 
dramatization, and as a result it suffers as literature, 
the action being too incessant and the proportion which 
diologue bears to narrative much too large. The story 
is based upon the rivalry between Barbarossa and 
HohenzoUern for the affections of a lady of the court, 
and contains material enough for one twice its length. 
(Century Co.). 

Coming down to the conspiracy of Fontiac, Mrs. 
Mary Catherine Crowley writes of " The Heroine of 
the Strait" (Little, Brown, & Co.), setting forth the 
incidents of the siege of Detroit by that interesting 
and unscrupulous savage. The principal figure in the 



book is a pretty French girl who is said to have saved 
the English garrison from overthrow, in spite of his- 
torical evidence that it was an Indian maiden who be- 
trayed the purpose of her people. The story could 
not fail to be interesting with so much action and no 
less romance running through it, and contrives to give 
a vivid conception of the troubles with which the 
Northwest, so peaceful now, was afflicted through 
more than a century. 

It is in another corner of the country that Annie T. 
Colcock lands her heroine in " Margaret Tudor " 
(Stokes), — at St. Augustine in the latter half of the 
seventeenth century, when the Spaniards were in con- 
trol. A beautiful English girl is captured with her 
shipmates, and her troubles begin with the infatuation 
for her which springs up in the heart of one of the 
Spanish officials. The story is both short and slight, 
an escape soon throwing Margaret back into the arms 
of her English lover. 

The most unfortunate island of Martinique is the 
scene of the later chapters in Mrs. Elizabeth Wormeley 
Latimer's " The Prince Incognito " (McClurg), a prince 
of the royal family of Parma and France being the pro- 
tagonist. He has married in due religious form, but 
entirely without the law of the land, the daughter of a 
Huguenot preacher, and she escapes with him to the 
West Indies, disguised as a cabin boy. The story is 
told with much simplicity and sense of reality, reading 
rather as veracious history than as fiction. 

Daniel Boone is the central figure of Mrs. Lucy 
Cleaver McElroy's " The Silent Pioneer " (Crowell), 
though the historical interest of it is subordinated to 
the account of the simple, hard, and primitive life of 
the early settlers in Kentucky. There are Indians, of 
course, and they are rather the conventional redskins 
of James Fenimore Cooper than those of Mr, Gar- 
land's last book, for example. Though the love story 
in the book makes its appeal to grown folk, boys will 
find this tale well worth their attention. 

Mrs. Frances Hodgson Burnett's latest novel, " The 
Methods of Lady Walderhurst" (Stokes), is a sequel 
to " The Making of a Marchioness," published less 
than a year ago. In it the life of the former Miss 
Emily Fox-Seton is continued, and the same kindliness 
of heart and devoted gratitude which made her a mod- 
ern Patient Grizel remains hers after her marriage to the 
right honorable marquis. In spite of the sensationalism 
inherent in the narrative, the book is made calm and 
dignified by Lady Walderhurst's admirable disposition. 

Like its predecessors from the same hand, Mr. 
Bram Stoker's " The Mystery of the Sea " (Doubleday, 
Page & Co.) is a bit of glowing melodrama, with 
hidden treasure, desperate villains, secret passages in 
ancient castles, abductions, shipwrecks, Spanish dons, 
old women with the gift of second-sight, and other un- 
usual elements of interest. It would be hard to get 
more action, or more kinds of action, between the 
covers of a book than will be found here; and it can 
be depended upon to keep one awake o' nights. 

Idyllic with the breath of the Irish uplands in its 
pages, " Patricia of the Hills " (Putnam) is a meritor- 
ious tale of the life which a selfish old spendthrift of 
a father forces upon his charming daughter when he 
learns that her voice can be coined into gold. Two 
lovers stand ready to take her from what she conceives 
to be her duty, and the device to which the author, 
Mr. C. K. Burrow, resorts to leave the field clear for 
the better of them is the least satisfactory thing in the 



392 



THE DIAL 



[June 1, 



book. Especially to be commended is the portrait of 
Patricia's uncle, the priest of the parish where all the 
action takes place apart from the brief stay in London. 

The title •* Scarlet and Hyssop " (Appleton) suits 
Mr. E. F. Benson's last story of fashionable life in 
Loudon admirably. A noble lord deeply resents the 
attention paid his wife by a former admirer of hers, 
who returns to England rich after the exile he had im- 
posed on himself at the time of her marriage. At the 
same time the husband carries on something more than 
a flirtation with one of his wife's acquaintances. The 
theme is wifely duty, and the awakening of love after 
a conventional marriage; and, like all Mr. Benson's 
novels, the story is well written. 

Nothing written in recent years has so inexhaustible 
a vein of irrepressible humor running through it as the 
last volume from the pen of Mr. W. W. Jacobs, " At 
Sunwich Port" (Scribner). In it, too, Mr. Jacobs 
demonstrates his ability to carry on a sustained narra- 
tive, his book concerning itself with the lives of three 
young people, from their " joyful schooldays " up to 
the point of marriage — or escape from it, as the case 
may be. One central figure, father of the heroine and 
minor hero, is a foil to the keen sense of humor which 
dominates the words and actions of everyone else, and 
the entire series of situations is designed with a keen 
knowledge of fictional art. 

Mr. Owen Wister has surpassed his "Lin McLean" 
in another novel of the Western plains, "The Virgin- 
ian " (Macmillan), the hero being a Wyoming " cow- 
puncher " and the heroine a nice little " Yankee school- 
ma'am " — the lineal descendant of Molly Stark — 
who flees from an importunate suitor, and family press- 
ure to marry a man she does not love, out to freedom 
amid the cattle- ranges of the Far West. Mr. Wister's 
intimate knowledge of his subject enables him to draw 
a figure of a typical plainsman in this transplanted 
Southerner, and the story is one which comes near to 
the heart of essential Americanism. 

" When Love is King " (Fenno) is a novel of some- 
what confused purposes, written by Mr. W. Dudley 
Mabry, It deals at the outset with the woes of child- 
hood and the betrayal of a widow left with a single 
child, a daughter, by a Christian minister. Later this 
same scoundrel attempts to wreck the career of a bro- 
ther clergyman through envy at his success, the scene 
transferring itself from the Middle West to the min- 
ing regions of the Sierras. At the close it becomes 
known that the preacher who was brought so near to 
ruin was the son of his malicious rival ; vice is duly re- 
buked, and virtue rewarded. It is an artless tale. 

Mr. Willis George Emerson's first novel, " Buell 
Hampton " (Forbes), errs chiefly in the attempt to put 
too much between the covers of a single book. The 
character from whom the story is named is a newspaper 
editor in Kansas, in a town that was the centre of a 
great cattle industry. The portrait is idealized 
greatly, but is vividly drawn and succeeds in doing a 
species of poetic justice to a much maligned class. A 
double love-story, international in one instance, runs 
through the argument ; there are many humorous inci- 
dents of Western life introduced, and the book is read- 
able though not well organized. 

Arkansas comes into the realm of fiction with " John 
Kenadie" (Houghton), — the work of Mr. Ripley D. 
Saunders. The sub-title calls it " The Story of his 
Perplexing Inheritance," and the mystery which leads 
the hero — a planter in a small way and a poet of no 



mean skill besides — to alternately love and hate a 
fellow-townsman, is well contrived and handled. The 
story is one of rather unusual merit. 

A romance gleaned from the rugged life of New 
England fisherfolk is Mr. Charles Clark Munn's " Rock- 
haven " (Lee & Shepard) . In this case the hero is a 
young man sent to exploit a quarry in the interest of 
a firm of stock-jobbing rascals in Boston, and the hero- 
ine is a young girl from the island where the quarry i» 
situated who has a wonderful natural gift of extract- 
ing moving music from her violin. In working out 
his story, the author makes an effective contrast of 
idyllic rusticity and the worst side of so-called respect- 
ability in cities. The book is well illustrated from 
drawings by Mr. Frank T. Merrill. 

"Miss Petticoats" (C. M. Clark Co.) is written by 
" Dwight Tilton," an avowed nom de plume, and made 
beautiful by six colored drawings by Mr. Charles H. 
Stephens. The scene of the earlier — and better — 
half of the book is laid in New Bedford, here called 
" Old Chetford," and deals with the poor and proud 
daughter of a French nobleman vagrant in America 
long enough to marry an old sea captain's one beloved 
child. The latter half of the book is melodramatic, 
redeemed only by a vivifying love. 

Born in France of an American father, an artist, and 
an Irish mother; reared in a little country village in 
England, where her widowed mother sold ginger beer;, 
and brought to the vicinity of Philadelphia by an aunt, 
the heroine of " Graystone " (Lippincott) has a checq- 
uered career, ending in her becoming a trained nurse 
and waking up to find herself a millionaire. Two of 
her former townsmen in England come to America and 
are connected in their lives with hers, but she falls into 
the arms of an American of the best type at the end. 
This sounds a trifle heterogeneous, but the author, Mr. 
William Jasper Nichols, has made a very good little 
story of it indeed, and deserves congratulation. 

Always exquisitely humorous, Kate Douglas Wiggin 
(Mrs. Riggs) is at her best — and briefest — in " The 
Diary of a Goose Girl" (Houghton). It is a story of 
English rustic life from the point of view of an intelli- 
gent and gently critical American girl, who is seeking 
escape from a pursuing lover by immuring herself in a. 
small household where poultry of one sort and another 
is the chief interest. The story is told with reality 
enough to make it seem truly autobiographical, and is 
suitably illustrated with pen-drawings by Mr. Claude A. 
Shepperson, admirably according with the insistent fun 
in the narrative. 

Two meritorious books from the pen of Miss Eliza- 
beth Godfrey prepare the reader for a third good story 
in " The Winding Road " (Holt), and for a mingling 
of some musical element in the narrative. The hero 
here is a young Englishman of good family, but with 
a gipsy strain in his blood that keeps him wandering 
through the world with his faithful violin. A sudden 
attack of illness leads him to fall in love with the young 
woman who nurses him back to health, a dweller in a 
little cottage in a remote part of England. After some 
anguish of soul, the twain are duly married, and set 
off on their travels together. Miss Godfrey is at her 
best in painting the scenes that follow, East and West 
appearing in the panorama of their wanderings; and 
through it all appear the flutterings of the confirmed 
vagrant man to be free, and the struggle of the wife to 
find a home. The end is the inevitable one, and re- 
deemed from undue tragedy by a touch of mystery.

Granted a woman of extraordinary social accomplish- 
ments, left a widow with little money and six daugh- 
ters just arriving at nubile age, Mrs. Lilias Campbell 
Davidson's " The Confessions of a Match-Making 
Mother " (J. F. Taylor & Co.) is at once whimsical 
and probable. It is purely a story of social politics, 
with the mother always a possibility as the heroine of 
a seventh slight romance. A round half-dozen of love 
stories in a single volume must satisfy the demands of 
the most exacting feminine reader. 

South Africa is the scene of " The Story of Eden " 
(John Lane), and Miss Dolf Wyllarde, the writer of the 
book, has been more than ordinarily happy in her title. 
For there is a serpent who leads away the heroine of 
her romance, and it differs from most books of the 
sort in enabling the girl to marry reasonably happily in 
spite of her early indiscretion. A careful and convinc- 
ing picture is drawn of a rather loose colonial society, 
with army officers to give it a character still more lax. 
The end comes with the sailing of the heroine and her 
husband for England while the war with the two re- 
publics is at its height, just as the villain of the plot 
is conveniently disposed of on the battlefield. 

Oriental sumptuousness and splendor of description 
mark Mr. John W. Harding's biblical romance of 
war and politics under King Hezekiah and the great 
Sennacherib. The prophet Isaiah is one of the leading 
figures, and a singer called Naphtali the hero of a 
highly imaginative and effective bit of gorgeousness. 
<« The Gate of the Kiss " (Lothrop) is the title, its ap- 
plication not becoming apparent until the crowning 
tragedy comes at the end of the book. The narrative 
is uniformly vivid and picturesque, and the story not 
improbable in spite of its distance in both time and 
place. Mr. Harding shows signs of familiarity with 
the' higher criticism, and has utilized side lights from 
recently discovered secular history to eke out the scrip- 
tural narrative. 

Rising from the humblest ranks in life and giving 
heavy hostage to fortune by a marriage most unprom- 
ising, the hero of " Enoch Strone " (Dillingham) be- 
comes a politician and statesman in England, always 
retaining his sympathy for the class from which he 
sprung, and that without descending to demagogism. 
Mr. E. Phillips Oppenheim writes the story with sym- 
pathies quite as broad and well directed as his hero's, 
and is particularly fortunate in drawing the headstrong 
yet susceptible character of Mrs. Strone. It is through 
much tribulation that the hero, mechanic, inventor, and 
politician of the best sort, comes into his own ; and the 
book is both long and readable. 



Mr. Wallace Irwin, whose « Love Sonnets of a 
Hoodlum " have added not a little to the gaiety of at 
least one nation (the only one that could understand the 
language), has produced, in " The Rubaiyat of Omar 
Khayyam, Junior," an even more delectable invention. 
The younger Omar, it seems, found Naishapur an un- 
interesting place to live in after his father's demise, and 
exiled himself to Borneo, where he cultivated the muse. 
The distinction between the two poets is summed up in 
the saying: " Where the philosophy of the elder Omar 
was bacchanalian and epicurean, that of the son was 
tobacchanalian and eclectic." These quatrains must be 
read to be appreciated; no extracts could illustrate ade- 
quately the quality of their delicious fooling. The 
book is published by Messrs. Elder & Shepard.

which Dr. Billings presides. The volume contains also 
a manual and historical sketch of the New York Li- 
brary Club, a flourishing organization which has now 
attained the respectable age of fifteen years. 

To readers in the latitude and longitude of Chicago 
the " Line-o'-Type Lyrics " of Mr. Bert Leston Taylor 
will need no introduction. They have been served up 
at the breakfast- table with the Chicago " Tribune " 
for many months past, and have proved better than 
peptenzyme for the digestion. To readers in less fav- 
ored regions they may be a novelty, and it is for such 
persons that we note the publication, in a small volume, 
of a selection from these mirth-provoking skits. Mr. 
William S. Lord, Evanston, is responsible for the book- 
let in all save authorship.

THE DIAL 



[June 1, 



Edwin Lawrence Godkin, who died in England on 
the twentieth of May, at the age of seventy, was an 
Irishman by birth, and the son of a distinguished Pro- 
testant clergyman. He was graduated from Queen's 
College, Belfast, when twenty years old, and entered 
upon the work of journalism. He represented the 
" Daily News " in Russia and Turkey during the 
Crimean War, and at the close of that struggle came 
to this country, where he sent to his London journal 
a series of letters descriptive of a horseback journey 
through the Southern States. He studied law in New 
York under David Dudley Field, and was admitted to 
the bar in 1859. During the next six years he prac- 
ticed both the legal and the journalistic professions, 
and then, in 1865, established " The Nation," of 
which be became the editor. He was now thoroughly 
identified with the country, and, as editor of " The 
Nation " until 1881, and as joint editor of the New 
York " Evening Post " after the weekly had been 
merged in the daily, he remained for full thirty-five 
years the most brilliant and forceful figure in Amer- 
ican journalism. Harvard made him an M. A. in 1871 
and Oxford made him a D. C. L. in 1897. He was 
essentially a writer of leading articles throughout his 
editorial career, although he occasionally prepared 
more elaborate essays for the magazines. His books 
consist of a " History of Hungary," a text book treat- 
ise on " Government," and three volumes of collected 
essays and editorial articles. The journalist, like the 
actor, leaves no visible monument to attest his great- 
ness, and must be content with such fame as results 
from his being enshrined in the hearts of his followers. 
Of his following in this sort, Mr. Godkin had reason 
to be proud. His work appealed to the intellect and 
the conscience of his readers, and the higher political 
and ethical thought of a whole generation of Amer- 
icans was shaped by it more largely than by any other 
single influence. From the start, " The Nation " re- 
mained our most serious and dignified exponent of the 
ideas and principles that unite men of clear thought 
and lofty purpose in the fellowship of the intellectual 
republic. Educated readers all over the country looked 
to it for light and for guidance as one political prob- 
lem after another came up for solution ; they swore 
by " The Nation " as the champion of enlightenment 
against prejudice, of sincerity against hypocrisy, and 
of principle against partisanship. If they occasionally 
swore at it under their breath, it was an additional 
tribute to its fearlessness and its relentless fashion of 
dealing with every form of sham and selfishness. And 
it was to the master-mind of the editor that all these 
tributes were really paid, for there was never any 
doubt of the personal force that was exerted through 
the anonymous page. When Mr. Godkin was honored 
by the University of Oxford a few years ago, some one 
suggested that bis influence upon political thought in 
America had been strikingly similar to the influence of 
John Stuart Mill upon English political thought, and 
the compliment seemed to us both happy and deserved. 
No words can express the gratitude felt by thousands 
of the younger men of to-day for the constant inspira- 
tion of Mr. Godkin's leadership. The list of the good 
causes which he championed, and of the political con- 
troversies which invariably found him on the side of 
justice and sound scholarship, is too lengthy to be more 
than hinted at. He was a valiant fighter for the re- 
form of the civil service, for honest money and the 
sanctity of national obligations, and for the doctrine 



that a public office is a public trust. Undeterred by the 
temporary unpopularity of his attitude, he opposed the 
protective system as the incarnation of selfish and cor- 
rupt politics. He opposed the brutal methods of the 
reconstruction policy. He opposed the partisanship 
that seated Hayes in the presidential chair and sought 
to bestow upon Blaine the highest honor in the gift of 
the Republic. He opposed the scandal of Hawaiian 
annexation, and praised the high-minded efforts of Mr. 
Cleveland to right that wrong. But when, a few years 
later, Mr. Cleveland made his one great official mis- 
take, and brought us to the verge of war with England 
upon a pretext that would have been ridiculous had it 
not been taken so seriously, he was as outspoken in 
condemnation as he had formerly been in praise. Fin- 
ally, and until the very end of his days, he protested 
with all the force of his immense moral indignation 
against the iniquity of our war with Spain, and the 
consequent iniquities of our broken pledge to Cuba, our 
insane war of Philippine conquest, and our practical 
repudiation of the political faith of the men who 
founded this nation. Sober opinion has already justi- 
fied him in most of these contentions, and will in time 
justify him in those that are still the subject of angry 
controversy. But his own voice will speak to us no 
more, and we know not from what other quarter we 
may hope to catch accents of such clear and ringing 
ethical quality. The spirit of compromise, of fatalism, 
of an easy-going acceptance of things as they are, in- 
fects our entire social organism, and we listen in vain 
for the trumpet-call of duty that shall arouse us from 
our national apathy in things spiritual.

A STUDY IN PROGRESS 



" ' Ralph Connor ' is some man's nom de plume. The world will 
insist on knowing whose. He has gone into the heart of the North- 
west Canadian mountains, and painted for us a picture of life in the 
mining camps of surpassing merit. With perfect wholesomeness, 
with exquisite delicacy, with entire fidelity, with truest pathos, with 
freshest humor, he has delineated character, has analyzed motives and 
emotions, and has portrayed life. Some of his characters deserve im- 
mortality, so faithfully are they created. "—S^.ZiOMis Globe- Democral. 

BLACK ROCK : A Tale of the Selkirks. 350th 
thousand. Illustrated. 12mo, cloth, $1.25. 



" Ralph Connor's ' Black Rock ' was good, but ' The Sky Pilot ' 
is better. The matter which he gives us is real life ; virile, true, 
tender, humorous, pathetic, spiritual, wholesome. His style, fresh, 
crisp, and terse, accords with the Western life, which he under- 
stands. Henceforth the foothills of the Canadian Rockies will prob- 
ably be associated in many a mind with the name of 'Ralph Connor.'"

" As picturesque, as simple, as strong as its predecessors, it is also

" I have been reading Dr. Qray's book with a great de- 
light. It breathes the spirit of the woods, and it is full of 
true religion. This, it seems to me, is a happy combina- 
tion. I like Christianity best with an out-door flavor. The 
trouble with it usually is, that we keep it too much shut 
up, sometimes in churches, sometimes in our own selfish 
hearts. This tends to blight, mildew, and various kinds 
of baccilli."

LETTERS TO AN ENTHUSIAST. 

By MARY COWDEN CLARKE. 
With 10 photogravure plates. Printed on English featherweight paper. Tall 8vo, boards, paper label. $2.50 net; delivered, $2.67. 
"THIS might be called a chapter iu the life of the great Shakespearean scholar, being a collection of her letters 
^ addressed to Mr. Robert Balmanno of New York, whom she nanoed " the Enthusiast." The correspondence began 
after the publication of her famous " Concordance," and lasted from 1850 to 1861. Every effort has been made 
to make the illustrations, typography, and binding consistent with the literary interest of the work. 

" ' Letters to an Enthusiast ' is of value to all lovers of literature, and of especial interest to those who wish 
to add to their library probably the only work published for fifty years which speaks familiarly of names famous 
in the last decade. The letters are personal in tone and abound iu interesting references to Hazlitt, Keats, 
Douglas Jerrold, Lamb, Leigh Hunt, Dickens, and Millais." — Kansas City Journal.

A SELECTION OF THE WORLD'S BEST SHORT STORIES. 

By SHERWIN CODY, author of "The Art of Short Story Writing." 
Printed on thin " Bible " paper, flexible binding. 18mo. $1.00 net; delivered, $1.08. 
A GENERAL introduction and successive introductions to the various separate stories in this volume give a 
^*- short but comprehensive history of the art of short story writing, from the Decameron and the Arabian 
Nights to Barrie and Kipling. Mr. Cody's earlier book on "The Art of Short Story Writing" has been declared 
by Mr. Zangwill to be the best treatise on the short story that has appeared. The list of stories includes ; Patient 
Griselda ; Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp ; Rip Van Winkle ; A Passion in the Desert ; A Christmas Carol ; 
The Gold Bug ; The Great Stone Face ; The Necklace ; The Man Who Would be King ; and others. 



PRINTED AT THE MERRYMOUNT PRESS. 
Mb. D. B. Updike of the Merrymount Press has excelled particularly in the production of books 
in which the subject matter calls for an irreproachable typographical treatment and a decid- 
edly literary appearance. Three books of Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Go.'s Spring List have been 
printed by Mr. Updike with notable success. They are small in size, most attractively bound 
in flexible cloth covers, and printed from a new type used only at the Merrymount Press.

a philosophy of some real value to the reader. Mr. Brown is well known as a collector of Aurelius. 

THE BOOK LOVER. 

A GUIDE TO THE BEST READING. By JAMES BALDWIN, Ph.D. 
A new edition, rewritten and printed from new plates. 12mo. $1.00 net; delivered, $1.06. 

THE unique position and permanent value of Professor Baldwin's "Book Lover" among books of literary 
reference has led to an urgent demand for a new edition brought down to date, as it has never been succeeded 
by an equally useful book of the same kind. For this new edition the text has been entirely re-written, and 
brought down to the present time, and many new lists added. In its previous form twelve editions were sold. 

These books may be had of all booksellers, or of

POUR VERY GOOD NOVELS 



None but the Brave By Hamblen sears 

RARELY, indeed, do we come across a story possessing so much vim and vigor as this stirring tale of the 
Revolution. The action is not only constant, but it is fascinating on every page. The plot is most unique, 
and the book, as a whole, is well worth reading. 

One papec says : " The interest of the story is very consistently maintained, and those who have a fancy for its style will 
find in it an abundance to sharpen their sense of entertainment." 

Another: "Mr. Sears's talent cannot be doubted. He writes graphically; he has invention ; he is, in brief, well equipped 
to write stories of action. The result is a novel well worth reading." 

Illustrated, $1.50. 



Lord Alingham, Bankrupt By Mane Manning 

DELIGHTFUL story, fresh in epigram and incident, and effectively entertaining, sparkling with wit and 

sarcasm, and indicating much clever knowledge of human nature and of the world in general. 

The Syracuse Herald B&ya : " There is very much to commend in Miss Manning's work. She never goes to unpardonable 

extremes, and thus her humor of delineation is not made ineffective. Her conversations are bright and clever ; and she has a 

very deft touch, and manages to make vital the things of which she tells us. This is a gift not altogether common among novelists. " 

$1.50. 



A 



Spindle and Plough By Mrs. Henry Dudeney 

AN uncommon story uncommonly well told, exhibiting effectively the sombre strength characteristic of Mrs. 
Dudeney's work, and fully maintaining the high standard of excellence set by her earlier books. 
The Detroit Free Press says : " Mrs. Dudeney never writes without a purpose, and in this very original study of an unusual 
character her object is to disclose the principle of femininity as dominating even a strong, forceful, self-reliant woman. . . . 
' Spindle and Plough ' is anything but commonplace, and is as strong a story as Mrs. Dudeney has written, without the gloom 
and pessimism of some of her books." _ 

^ $1.50. 



The Yellow Fiend By Mrs. Alexander 

The Brooklyn Eagle says : " In ' The Yellow Fiend ' Mrs. Alexander draws a vivid picture of an aged miser who labors under 
the delusion that a fiendish spirit, which can only be placated by the continued accumulation of the precious metal, dwells in 
gold. Detestable as the man's character is the reader feels that he is deserving of pity, his sordid life having originated in his 
brooding over the death of a beautiful and idolized young wife who had fallen into a decline from want of the common necessaries 
of life. The main interest of the story centres in the miser's granddaughter, who is unexpectedly left to his support by the 
death of her parents, and the story of her unhappiness, despair, and struggles to become an artist, in order to support herself, is 
sufficiently exciting to hold the interest to the end, which happily promises a fuller and happier life for the sorely tried heroine. ' '

full-page plates and many decorations from drawings by Charles Livingston Bull. Cloth,

Although his works invite comparison, he does not follow in the footsteps of Kipling in the "Jungle

Heart of the Ancient Wood " is heard in deeper cadence in " The Kindred of the Wild."

THE CENTENNIAL HABIT. 



The practice of celebrating anniversaries, 
when they count up to some round number of 
years, is not exactly a modern one, but it has 
received such an impetus in our own time 
that we may fairly characterize it as a habit. 
Owing to the historical accident of our use of 
the Arabic system of numerals, the number 
one hundred, or some one of its multiples or 
factors, is the invariable basis of such cele- 
brations. Had the Babylonian reckoning by 
twelves instead of tens been adopted by our 
civilization, we should have had an entirely 
different set of numbers to work upon, but we 
should doubtless have singled out, just as we 



do now, the recurrent years of the completed 
cycle for special observance. Obviously noth- 
ing could be more artificial or conventional 
than this practice, which, to the logical mind, 
is matter for amusement ; but the habit of 
mental economy which leads us instinctively to 
attach a special significance to the round num- 
ber will always lead men to take special note 
of the tenth, or the fiftieth, or the one hundreth 
anniversary of the important event, and direct 
toward that event a degree of retrospective at- 
tention that nobody would think of giving it a 
year earlier or later. 

One cannot help thinking, somehow, of the 
analogy offered by our mechanical religious ob- 
servance of the seventh day, by which so many 
people compound their real indifference to the 
whole subject of religion. In vain it is urged 
that if religion has any vital meaning at all, its 
influence ought to affect our lives on one day 
no less than another ; similarly, it is urged in 
vain that the memory of a great benefactor of 
mankind ought to remain with us as an abiding 
force all the time instead of appealing to us 
once in a hundred years or even once a year, 
that the fundamental principles of our national 
life ought to be the constant inspiration of our 
civic conduct, instead of being recalled, in a 
more or less perfunctory manner, when the 
full year has rolled round, or commemorated 
by some sort of a show when the full term of 
a hundred years is ended. Reason urges these 
considerations on us in vain ; and we shall no 
doubt continue, until the end of the chapter, in 
our easy-going ways, — paying lip-service once 
a week or once a year to the religious faith 
which we profess, once a year or once a century 
to the memory of the great men, to the declara- 
tion of the principle or the foundation of the 
institution that exacts our homage. 

Leaving out of our discussion the more fre- 
quently recurring periods, let us think for a 
moment about decades and centuries and mil- 
lennial cycles. The fundamental reason why 
we exalt them into an illogical significance 
is doubtless found in our instinctive mental 
economy. Another reason is found in the 
taint of hypocrisy which is so apt to affect 
our attitude toward most serious subjects of 
contemplation that are not immediately related 
to our every-day tasks. Still another reason, 
and a most potent one, is the delight which the 



410 



THE DIAL 



[June 16, 



average man takes in a show. We Americans, 
particularly, considering that we are a demo- 
cratic people by political profession, derive a 
most unholy satisfaction from every sort of 
pomp and ceremonial, and, while repudiating 
the ideas upon which such old-world inventions 
rest, do our best to rival the ostentations of 
" effete monarchies." Sponsors as we are of a 
new social order nationally consecrated by great 
deeds and devotions, we copy as far as we may 
the pageantry of the old order, and look with 
envying regret upon those European possibili- 
ties which are American impossibilities. To 
those whose eyes are chiefly for the spectacular, 
an American centennial naust be a poor thing 
in comparison, let us say, with a Hungarian 
millennial ; what compensation we have for the 
picturesque elements denied us may be satisfy- 
ing to the intellect, but they leave the aesthetic 
sense a little starved. 

We are not saying all this by way of blame 
for an assumed manifestation of national folly; 
the craving for show and color and imposing 
ceremonial is a thing too essentially inherent 
in human nature to be thus stigmatized. To 
the historical sense no less than to the sense 
for the picturesque do these things have gen- 
uine value, and we are quite worthily occupied 
as a people when we bend our best energies to 
such an impressive commemoration as that of 
the first centennial of the nation's birth, or the 
fourth centennial of the discovery of the new 
world. But it is nevertheless possible that the 
thing may be overdone. When we think of 
the long succession of centennials since 1776, 
it seems as though some of them might have 
been spared. It was only last year that we were 
celebrating the installation of John Marshall; 
and next year, or the year after, we shall be 
celebrating the Louisiana Purchase. It some- 
times seems that anything will serve as a pre- 
text for a centennial celebration. The age of 
the multi-centennials is now upon us. Yale had 
a bicentennial a few months ago, and a decade 
ago the whole country had a quadricentennial. 
The first of what will doubtless be a long series 
of tricentennials was celebrated the other day 
at Cuttyhunk, in memory of Bartholomew Gos- 
nold's short-lived colony, Jamestown is sure to 
<;ome in course of time, and Plymouth and Sa- 
lem, and the whole series of colonial beginnings. 
Possibly after a while we shall become weary 
of recalling our national history in this spas- 
modic way, and hit upon some more rational 
plan of keeping the past alive in our memory. 

Among the most acceptable centennials of 



recent years have been those planned in cele- 
bration of the founding of our older colleges. 
Harvard attained to the dignity of a quarter- 
millennial as long ago as 1886 ; Yale had its 
bicentennial only last year ; Princeton had its 
sesquicentennial half a dozen years ago. We 
read the other day that some small college 
or other, nearing its seventy-fifth birthday, was 
preparing to celebrate a semi-sesquicentennial. 
This opens a rather appalling vista of frac- 
tional cycles and the possibilities associated 
with them. And our own University of Chi- 
cago last year, youthful through no fault of its 
own, set anew fashion in anniversaries by cele- 
brating its first decennial with as much display 
as would have been suited to an institution many 
times as aged. Ten years should certainly be 
the limit, and a halt should sternly be called at 
this point ; otherwise the next new educational 
foundation to be established may be so eager to 
have its own praises sung that it will seek to com- 
memorate the completion of its first lustrum. 
The literary centennial is usually a simple 
and dignified performance, against which little 
may be urged beyond what has already been 
said of all periodical celebrations. Some years 
ago, we noted the fact that exactly two thou- 
sand years had elapsed since the birth of Cicero, 
and suggested as a novelty in celebrations a 
bimillennial demonstration on the part of clas- 
sical scholars. Among the longer terms cele- 
brated in our own time there will be recalled 
the millennial of Alfred last summer, the sixth 
centennial of Dante in 1865, the fourth of 
Michelangelo in 1874, the third of Shake- 
speare in 1864, and the Goethe sesquicenten- 
nial in 1899. The simple literary centennial 
is being celebrated somewhere and by some- 
body almost every year. It is usually char- 
acterized by an uncritical laudation of its subject 
in both speech and print, and, unlike the cere- 
mony of canonization, it does not willingly give 
a respectful hearing to the devil's advocate. 
In the judgment of those who plan the cele- 
bration, the subject is already canonized, and 
there is nothing more to say. The true spirit of 
literary appreciation is not, after all, to be found 
in demonstrations of any sort. These are nearly 
always suggestive of the Pharisee who says his 
prayers openly to gain a reputation for piety. 
The real lover of literature will, rather than 
indulge in any outward manifestation of his 
affection, follow the example of Lamb, and offer 
up unuttered and heartfelt words of grace when- 
ever he takes up his Milton or his Spenser for 
an hour of spiritual recreation.

The Chateaubriand Memoirs.* 



" If I were still the owner of these Memoirs, 
I would either keep them in manuscript or 
delay their appearance for fifty years." So, 
just before his death, wrote the Viscount Cha- 
teaubriand of the Memoires d' Outre-tombe. 
With their completion, he had tried to " cheat 
the tedium of those last forlorn hours which 
we neither desire, nor know how to employ." 
Before the end came he found himself under 
the painful necessity of selling the Memoirs, 
and they were published immediately after his 
death. Now, after a delay a little longer than 
that wished for by the author, there is appear- 
ing an English edition of these justly famous 
reminiscences. The translator is Alexander 
Teixeira de Mattos, whose uncompromisingly 
foreign name is no index of his ability to mas- 
ter the English idiom. Four volumes, carrying 
the Viscount's life down to the year 1829, have 
already appeared, and the Messrs. Putnam 
promise the remaining two within the year. 

In his own day, Chateaubriand was rated 
unreservedly as the foremost man of letters in 
France, if not in all Europe. Today his remi- 
niscences, in America at least, must win atten- 
tion largely on their own merit, — rather as 
the stirring life-story of a great Frenchman 
than as the personal revelation of the author 
of " Atala " and " Rene," or " The Genius of 
Christianity." 

Few men, surely, have more material at 
hand out of which to construct an autobiogra- 
phy. A dreamy, vagabond childhood spent in 
Brittany; a restless youth dedicated to the 
church but finally devoted to the army; a pre- 
sentation at Versailles, arranged to satisfy a 
brother's ambition; a taste of garrison life, and 
another, very unwelcome to the shy young sol- 
dier, of Parisian society; finally a quixotic 
journey to the United States in search of the 
Northwest Passage, — and at twenty-four, when 
the Chevalier de Chateaubriand came back to 
France to fight for his king against his father- 
land, he was already a man of the world. The 
Bourbon dynasty he defended suffered annihi- 
lation, friends and family languished in prison 
or died under the guillotine; but Chateaubriand

himself lived to win the gratitude of Napoleon 
and to watch the fall of " the Man of the 
Time," to witness the restoration of the legiti- 
mate royal line, and to occupy positions of 
honor and trust under the new government. 
At the close of the fourth volume we leave him 
at the summit of his fame, as French Ambas- 
sador to Rome. 

So much for the political side of his career. 
In its intervals of exile or disgrace he became 
a renowned traveller; under stress of poverty 
he made his literary reputation. In one capa- 
city or another he came to know, casually at 
least, all the greatest men of his time in both 
continents. Naturally in many chapters of his 
Memoirs he is less the central figure than the 
observer, the critic, or the raconteur. 

Yet in spite of the objectivity inseparable 
from the story of so eventful a life, the Me- 
moirs are deeply subjective ; to the Anglo- 
Saxon mind certainly, even obtrusively and 
baldly egotistical. " It was fated that I should 
be plagued by princes." Like " the man of 
destiny " whom he served, Chateaubriand be- 
lieves himself born for great things, and insists 
upon his readers' appreciation and reverence. 
And yet in the next breath he lets fall a de- 
preciatory sentence like this: 

" Good for everything where others, good for noth- 
ing where I myself am concerned: there you have me." 

Does destiny, then, overcome temperament? 
With similar inconsistency he breaks into a 
stirring narrative with a plaintive comment on 
the vanity of the things of this world: 

"While bidding farewell to the woods of Aulney, 
I shall recall the farewell which long ago I bade to the 
woods of Combourg; my days are all farewells." 

Again, with melancholy languor, he says of 
himself : 

" It is easy to possess resignation, patience, a general 
obligingness, equanimity of temper, when one interests 
himself in nothing, when one is wearied by everything, 
when one replies to good and bad fortune alike with a 
desperate and despairing « What does it matter? ' " 

This Byronic boredom is no longer in the 
fashion ; combined with the strange turns of 
fortune which the Viscount experienced, it 
imparts to the Memoirs a tinsel, theatrical air 
of romantic melancholy, curiously out of date 
since Carlyle and Emerson. 

Yet, for all his hlase affectation, the Vis- 
count has many admirable qualities. He is 
fearless in times of great danger, honest when 
honesty was clearly impolitic, true to his legiti- 
mate principles no matter what they cost him, 
an avowed advocate of Christianity in a nation

of atheists. He is forever lamenting that he 
was born too late, but his world-weariness does 
not tempt him into idle acquiescence in the new 
order of things. 

The style of the Memoirs is as varied as the 
matter that composes them. A perfect mirror 
of the man who wrote it, it is an odd mixture 
of garrulity, affectation, pomposity, brilliancy, 
and delicate charm. Occasionally he becomes 
tersely epigrammatic, — as when, apropos of 
his neglecting to visit Luther's tomb at Witten- 
berg, he thus expresses the full measure of his 
conservatism : 

" Protestantism in religion is only an illogical heresy, 
in politics only an abortive revolution." 

More often he indulges in picturesque de- 
scription. The full force of the romantic man- 
ner comes out in a paragraph like this upon 
Mirabeau : 

«' Mirabeau's ugliness, laid on over the substratum of 
beauty special to his race, produced a sort of powerful 
figure from the Last Judgment of Michael Angelo. . . . 
The scars dug into the orator's face by the small- 
pox had rather the semblance of gaps left by the fire. 
Nature seems to have moulded his head for Empire 
or the gallows, and to have hewn his arms to clasp 
a nation or carry off a woman. When he shook his 
mane as he looked at the mob, he stopped it; when he 
raised his paw and showed his claws, the plebs ran 
furiously. I have seen him in the tribune, amid the 
awful disorder of a sitting, sombre, ugly, and motion- 
less ; he reminded one of Milton's Chaos, shapeless and 
impassive in the centre of his own confusion." 

His delicacy of touch is most evident in 
the descriptions of nature, — of Brittany as 
he knew it in his childhood, or the primeval 
forests of the new world ; or again in picturing 
the creatures of his imagination, particularly 
that sylph of his boyish dreams, a woman built 
up " out of all the women whom I had ever 
seen," with an admiiture of the graces of the 
heathen goddesses, and even a hint of the Vir- 
gin herself. 

On the whole, it is the first volume, which 
deals with Chateaubriand's youth, that has 
most life and atmosphere. It is the idyl, the 
pastoral, to which his style is best suited. The 
complex narrative of the later years would 
often be more interesting if the stage were 
smaller. Too many of the personages written 
of have to be rescued from oblivion by the 
foot-notes, and are not really resuscitated. 
The polemical portions of the book, too, pre- 
senting documentary evidence in vindication 
of the author or his friends, possess little of 
the human interest which is the vital principle 
of biography. But if this treasure-trove is 
unwieldy, De Mattos' friend was right in call- 



ing it also monumental. That is why the 
translator has wished to present it to us in 
English for the first time in its impressive en- 
tirety. He has done his part as annotator and 
translator exceedingly well. The publishers 
have brought the work out in handsome vol- 
umes, abundantly illustrated with views of 
Chateaubriand's homes, and portraits of his 
contemporaries, many of them reproduced in 
photogravure. So at last there is no reason 
why this man, so conspicuous both in the lit- 
erature and history of his time, may not be- 
come pleasantly familiar to a large circle of 
English readers, through what many critics 
consider his most important work — his story 
of himself. Edith Kellogg Dunton. 



The Beginnings op the Great West.* 

We may distinguish two principal " Wests " 
in American history. The old or middle West 
extended from the Alleghany mountains to the 
Mississippi river. Its settlement began during 
the Revolution, and it was fairly filled with 
population and its political organization was 
completed by the middle of the nineteenth cen- 
tury. The tier of States lying along the west 
bank of the Mississippi, and extending from 
Louisiana to Minnesota, became historically, 
as it was geographically, a part of the old West. 
The region beyond and between them and the 
Pacific Ocean constituted the new, the far, or 
the great West. Its settlement was a long 
time delayed. At first the land was not needed, 
and, more than that, was not thought worth 
having. Later, a barrier of Indian reserva- 
tions checked emigration, and the slavery con- 
troversy blocked organization. The occupation 
of this region began suddenly, in the fourth 
decade of the century, with the annexation of 
Texas, the emigration to Oregon, and the rush 
to California for gold. 

The greater interest attaching to these events 
has obscured the earlier period, and its history 
is almost a blank. Captain H. M. Chittenden 
has recently entered this neglected field, in his 
" American Fur Trade of the Far West," and 
around the history of the fur trade has grouped 
almost the whole history of the period. He 
has found that the period is not only interest- 
ing, but that it exerted a direct and important 
influence upon the course of later events, serving

Hiram Martin Chittenden. In three volumes. New York : 
Francis P. Harper.

THE DIAL 



413 



as a sort of preparatory or " middle-age " stage 
in the development of the West. Specifically, 
his work covers the period between the return 
of Lewis and Clark, in 1806, and the year 
1843. The latter year is in many ways a 
turning-point in Western history. Fremont's 
exploring expeditions had recently begun, the 
Santa Fe trade was finally closed, and the first 
considerable emigration to Oregon took place. 

Captain Chittenden divides his work into 
five parts. Part I. treats of the characteristic 
features of the fur trade as carried on during 
the period under review, the kind of furs 
sought, and the methods of trapping and tra- 
ding. The business is peculiar in many re- 
spects, and an understanding of its peculiarities 
is essential to an understanding of its history. 
Part II. presents the history of the organization 
and operations of the various fur companies. 
This part comprises the bulk of the work, and 
contains the principal results of the author's 
researches. Supplementary to the history of 
the fur trade, an account is given of the over- 
land trade with Santa Fe, from its inception 
in 1822 until its close in 1843. The route of 
both the Oregon and Santa Fe trails is care- 
fully described. Part III. gives an account of 
contemporary events, not forming a part of the 
fur trade, but more or less directly affecting 
it, — such as the War of 1812, Long's ex- 
ploring expeditions, Leavenworth's campaign 
against the Aricaras, Atkinson's treaty-making 
tour, and the small-pox scourge among the 
Indians in 1837. Part IV. is an anecdotal 
account of the more notable incidents and 
characters connected with the fur trade, stories 
of Indian fights, hairbreadth escapes, and fron- 
tier desperadoes. Part V. gives a description 
of the mountains, rivers, flora, fauna, and 
native tribes of the West, in their relation to 
the fur trade. An appendix reproducing some 
original documents, and a valuable map indi- 
cating routes of travel and the location of 
trading-posts, complete the work. 

Captain Chittenden's insight into historical 
relations is clear. He brings out the impor- 
tance of the exclusion of France from the 
American continent by the French and Indian 
war, an event often obscured by the stress we 
are accustomed to lay upon the Revolution. 
His identification of each of the successive ter- 
ritorial acquisitions composing the Far West 
with marked geographical features is worth 
emphasizing. Upper Louisiana comprised the 
watershed of the Missouri, Oregon the valley 
of the Columbia, and the Mexican cession lay 



chiefly within the drainage basin of the Colo- 
rado ; so that each territorial addition consisted 
of a distinct geographical unity. On its biblio- 
graphical side. Captain Chittenden's work is 
unsatisfactory. The bulk of his material is 
drawn from rare files of early Missouri news- 
papers, and from the manuscript records of the 
fur companies ; but his references to sources 
are so indefinite that one can scarcely test the 
accuracy of his work without undertaking it 
anew. A careful bibliography of printed books, 
a description of the manuscript material, and 
more specific reference to the authorities for 
particular statements, would have been a de- 
cided advantage. 

Upon one subject of some general interest, 
Captain Chittenden is in error. He concludes 
that the so-called " flathead deputation," out 
of which the Methodist and American Board 
missions in Oregon grew, visited St. Louis in 
the autumn of 1832. Major Edmond Mallet 
has proved, from the correspondence of Bishop 
Rosati printed in the " Annals for the Propa- 
gation of the Faith," and from the registry of 
sepultures kept in the Catholic Cathedral at 
St. Louis, that the visit of the deputation took 
place in the autumn of 1831. The missionary 
account of this visit was derived from a letter 
written by a Wyandot chief named William 
Walker to G. P. Disoway, which was originally 
printed in the " Christian Advocate " in 1833, 
and which Captain Chittenden reprints in an 
appendix. In transmitting the letter to the 
" Christian Advocate," Mr. Disoway assumed, 
and it has since been taken for granted, that 
Walker's trip was made in 1832 ; but Walker's 
letter does not say so, and the records of the 
St. Louis Indian Agency, now in the library 
of the Kansas State Historical Society, show 
that it was made the year before. November 
22, 1831, the Iowa Sub-Agent reported to 
General Clark the visit of " Mr. Walter and 
party," either the agent or the copyist changing 
Walker to Walter ; and General Clark, in 
writing the Indian Department December 28, 
1831, referred to " the Wyandot Indians and 
their leaders, who lately explored the Country 
above." In his report to General Cass, dated 
November 20, 1831, General Clark doubtless 
referred to the" flathead delegation " in saying 
that Indians "from west of the Rocky moun- 
tains are visiting me." The point is chiefly 
interesting as showing the careless and uncrit- 
ical way in which missionary history has been 
made up. 

The importance of the fur trade is to be 



414 



THE DIAL 



[June 16, 



measured by the activity of the traders rather 
than by their number. The average number 
of traders is estimated as about five hundred ; 
yet this small number almost covered the entire 
West with their forts and trading-posts. Cap- 
tain Chittenden has located and traced the 
origin of as many as one hundred and forty of 
these posts. The greatest service that the 
traders rendered was that of exploring the en- 
tire region and pointing out the most practic- 
able routes of travel in its later settlement. 
Exploration was of course incidental with them, 
as with the early American colonists ; but an 
increase of geographical knowledge nevertheless 
resulted. The overland Astoria expeditions 
very nearly opened the whole of the Oregon 
Trail. The California expeditions of J. S. 
Smith added so much geographical information, 
that Gallatin was able to construct a fairly 
accurate map of the entire West, — =- a map 
which Bonneville appropriated and in some 
respects improved. In fact, as Captain Chit- 
tenden points out, the fur traders were the true 
" pathfinders " of the West, and anticipated 
all the important geographical discoveries that 
are usually attributed to the official explorers 
of later date. 

Politically, the traders rendered important 
service. At the North they held the British 
in check until the time was ripe for settlement. 
At the South they not only opened the way for 
military occupation, but, by uniting New Mex- 
ican interests with our own, rendered that oc- 
cupation the more acceptable. The settlement 
of the West was largely a question of trans- 
portation, and this question was worked out 
gradually by the experiments of the traders. 
The earliest trade followed the Missouri river, 
and was carried on with keelboats until steam- 
boats took their place in 1832. The overland 
trade began with pack-horses. Wagons were 
introduced on the Santa Fe Trail in 1822, and 
on the Oregon Trail in 1830. Bonneville took 
the first wagons through the South Pass to 
Green river in 1832, and the Oregon emigra- 
tion closed the period of experiment by taking 
them through to the Columbia river in 1843. 
Thus, from every point of view, the life of the 
hunter, the trapper, and the trader constituted 
a preparatory stage in the history of the West, 
which paved the way for its later settlement 
and growth. 

In looking back upon the history of the fur 
trade, it is easy to see that the United States 
ought either to have carried on the trade 
through its own agencies, or to have granted 



it, under strict control, to a monopoly like the 
Hudson's Bay Company. In its earlier stages, 
the Indian trade was regulated through gov- 
ernment factories ; but the system was never 
extended to any extent beyond the Mississippi, 
and was abolished in 1822. Private competi- 
tion debauched the natives with liquor, incited 
tribal wars, and gave the Indian a poor opinion 
of the character of the white man. But it was 
an era of faith in the efficiency of free com- 
petition as a regulator of business, and of belief 
that monopoly in any form was a violation of 
private right. It was not understood that 
competition often reduces business to the level 
of the lowest competitor, and that monopoly in 
many cases is the best form of regulation. The 
statesmen of the time acted, in their regulation 
of the fur trade, upon universally accepted 
theory. The story of the Indian is a painful 
one, but the outcome could not in any event 
have been greatly altered, p jj^ Hodder. 



Records of ak Amiable "Weakness.* 



The enthusiasm of the typical collector, 
whether of faded tapestries, of postage stamps, 
or of bugs and beetles, excites a smile, half of 
amusement, half of envy, from one who has 
never felt himself carried away by the cacoethes 
coUigendi, the rage to possess an unrivalled 
assortment of something, no matter how intrin- 
sically worthless and uninteresting. One of 
the present writer's schoolmates, by no means 
a wooden-headed lad, was given to collecting 
bits of wood, no two of a kind ; and these lig- 
neous fragments he would exhibit with infinite 
complacency. What the collector collects mat- 
ters not, if only the collecting mania be upon 
him. 

But when the madness takes the form ex- 
emplified by Mr. Joline's diverting collection 
of autographia, amusement gives place to grati- 
tude. His book is an onniium- gatherum of 
many sorts of good things, and bears ample 
testimony to a long experience in intelligent 
collecting of interesting memorials of interest- 
ing people. The autograph collector, in Mr. 
Joline's sense of the term, is not a collector of 
signatures, not an autograph-album fiend, but 
a person who appreciates the value of letters 
and other signed documents from the hands of 
the good and great, and who is given to pre-

serving such memorials. The self-respecting 
collector is not obtrusive ; he never writes a beg- 
ging letter to a stranger, but gathers his ma- 
terial from friends and acquaintances, and from 
reputable traders in such wares. The dangers 
of imposture are ever to be guarded against. 
Clever forgeries abound. Copies also that are 
made in all innocence occasionally find their 
way into the market as originals. Photographic 
reproductions, too, may deceive the inexpe- 
rienced, but never the expert. Most annoying 
of all, a letter signed " Thomas Jones " may 
not be his, but from another man of the same 
name. Our author justly deplores the increas- 
ing vogue of the stenographer and the type- 
writer. The one lingering trace of individuality 
in a present-day letter is too often limited to 
the signature, and even this may be only the 
impression of a rubber stamp. Truly the out- 
look is depressing. 

The " meditations " are delightfully miscel- 
laneous in character and haphazard in arrange- 
ment, chopped into chapters of convenient 
length. The author pleads, in humorous apol- 
ogy for his lack of method, that " these desul- 
tory jottings, with all their sins and imperfec- 
tions, are only the staggerings of the mind of 
an ancient collector, the maunderings of an 
obsolete person." Being a book-lover as well 
as an autograph collector, he has harvested 
much that is of literary interest, including au- 
thors' manuscripts and rare first editions with 
authors' signatures. Dramatic, political, and 
historical characters are also well represented. 
Revolutionary generals cut a considerable 
figure in the book, with their quaintly spelled 
letters ; and even the Signers — the despair of 
all collectors, so far as a complete collection of 
the famous fifty-six is concerned — make a re- 
spectable showing. The written-to-order letter 
is seldom of great interest, but here is one of 
Stevenson's that does not lack character : 

" Vailima, Upolu, Samoa. 

" You have sent me a slip to write on: you have sent 
me an addressed envelope: you have sent it to me 
stamped: many have done as much before. You have 
spelled my name right, and some have done that. In 
one point you stand alone: you have sent me the 
stamps for my post-office, not the stamps for yours. 
What is asked with so much consideration, I take a 
pleasure to grant. Here, since you value it and have 
been at the pains to earn it by such unusual attention 
— here is the signature of 

"Robert Louis Stevenson. 
" For the one civil autograph collector, Charles R — ." 

There is a tone of weary condescension about 
this, and one resents the writer's imputation of 
incivility against all previous applicants for his 



valued signature. Surely there must have been 
many among his admirers who, unable though 
they were to procure Samoan postage stamps, 
yet failed not to proffer their requests in re- 
spectful terms. Contrast now another great 
man's response to a like petition : 

"R. Shelton Mackenzie, — Below is my autograph 
for your good lady as you request. 

" Yours truly, 

" A. Lincoln." 

As an instance of the mock-modest auto- 
graph-to-order, take the following. Its absurd 
self-abasement is laughable. 

"Lord Rosebery presents his compliments to Miss 
C — , but would rather not make her collection and 
himself ridiculous by sending it the autograph of an 
insignificant person." 

How crushing to Miss C — , to be called it! 
For we hold, with Mr. Joline, that one does 
not send one's autograph to a collection, but to 
the collector. Finally, as an example of grace- 
ful compliance with a request that must always 
be more or less of an annoyance, nothing could 
be better than this from Colonel Higginson : 

" I have your note. If, as somebody says, applica- 
tions for autographs are ' a shadow cast by success,' I 
suppose one can no more object to them than one can 
quarrel with his shadow." 

Beside autographs, the book deals with 
many remotely related matters, mostly literary 
or historical. Judgments are delivered in the 
slap-dash manner of an after-dinner chat, and 
so are not to be taken too seriously. Here is 
an opinion on English reviewers that is not 
without basis : 

" There does not appear to be any adequate reason 
why English reviewers should be as hard and severe as 
they almost invariably are. Their style bears to true 
criticism about the same relation which the conduct of 
the savage who knocks down the object of his affec- 
tions and drags her to his home bears to the conven- 
tional courtship of civilization. . . . Any writer is en- 
titled to a fair, generous, and liberal treatment. It is 
a small and petty mind which will use the power of 
an anonymous reviewer to denounce and ridicule his 
subject." 

Our author seems not to be heartily enam- 
oured of his English cousins. Because Mr. 
Serjeant Robinson, in his "Reminiscences of 
the Bench and Bar," finds fault with Judah P. 
Benjamin's American twang, Mr. Joline retorts 
that Benjamin's tone " was absolutely twang- 
less, and it was, as compared with the hollow, 
rough, and coarse bow-wow of the Englishman, 
like the song of the nightingale beside the caw 
of the crow." The American twang, however, 
is not a figment of the British fancy — to our 
sorrow be it said, — and the first step toward 
amendment is honest confession. The utter-

ance of the cultured Englishman, whether in 
conversation or in public speech, however we 
may criticise his accent, his dropping of final 
g in ing^ and other offenses, has more of music, 
of rhythm, of varied modulation, than has 
ours ; and this is a matter of common remark. 
By a curious fatality, we censure the very 
errors we ourselves are most prone to commit 
— a reflection that gives the professional critic 
pause. After deploring Mrs. Stowe's per- 
petuation of the scandal concerning Byron's 
unhappy domestic relations, the Autograph 
Collector, only two pages further on, refers 
to Carlyle and his wife as living together in 
"ferocious gloom." "Their feuds and quar- 
rels," he adds, " were bitter and continuous." 
Again, he lays it down as a truth that quota- 
tions are more than likely to he incorrect ; and 
on a later page he furnishes an involuntary 
proof of his thesis by misquoting the opening 
lines of Emerson's " Brahma." He takes 
pains, on page 132, to correct a slight mis- 
statement on page 19, adding, "after all, my 
mistake is not of much importance, except to 
me, for I always feel sure that I never make a 
blunder — until I am caught at it." Com- 
mending this love of accuracy for its own sake, 
may we correct another slight error of his ? It 
is a little surprising that so good a classical 
scholar as Mr. Joline shows himself to be

The Principles of Western 
Civilization.* 

It must be confessed that Mr. Kidd's latest 
book, " Principles of Western Civilization," is 
rather a disappointing piece of social philoso- 
phy. The same faults, and, strange to say, the 
same merits which characterized his " Social 
Evolution " are evident also in his " Western 
Civilization." In each book the first chapter 
is singularly stimulating and concise in thought, 
as it sketches the achievements of our present 
time and asks what is in store for us in the fu- 
ture. One naturally expects an equally direct 
and clearly formulated answer, or at least an 
acute and pointed investigation into the ele- 
ments which might tend toward some satisfac- 
tory solution. But the author disdains such

business-like methods. The thread of discus- 
sion, at first so firmly grasped, in the very next 
chapter drops as from weary hands, and there 
ensues a desultory, rambling inquiry into the 
innumerable factors that have made up the 
present stage of our civilization. This inquiry 
consists largely of reiteration of set phrases, 
and of what some one has said concerning so- 
cial and economic problems twenty years ago. 
We have never read an author who so con- 
sistently argued backward to a point lying 
leagues and leagues away from the original 
basis of the argument, and who so unremit- 
tingly forced his reader to review old issues 
only too familiar or possibly even discarded. 

But one has perhaps no right to quarrel 
with an author about his methods, if he only 
comes to a definite conclusion in the end. 
Here too, however, our author is singularly 
unsatisfying ; he says a great deal about the 
present and the past, but systematically relin- 
quishes any but the vaguest and most general 
conclusions about the future. Yet Mr. Kidd 
distinctly claims originality for his book, and 
the glory of a discovery quite as important for 
future social philosophy as Darwin's " natural 
selection " or the " survival of the fittest." 

He begins by pointing out, what we are 
sorry to say everybody has long been aware of, 
that our present period is a period of self-seeking 
as the generally accepted moral code. This 
code is based upon the liberal doctrines of the 
eighteenth century, the accentuated individ- 
ualism of the French Revolution, and the 
social-democratic ideal of equal enjoyment for 
all, counteracted by the new Herrenmoral of 
the age now beginning. Centuries of develop- 
ment have worked toward this end ; and since 
this condition sees its ideal in the satisfac- 
tion of the individual, Mr. Kidd calls it the 
" ascendancy of the present." Yet, basing 
his argument upon his study of Darwin and 
Weissmann, he maintains that nature is not 
satisfied with the present, that in fact the 
present is what nature is least concerned with ; 
it is for the future, for the generations to 
come, that the individual is sacrificed. Thus 
there is some method in the apparent madness 
of waste and destruction ; and for this future, 
natural selection in the present is the necessary 
prerequisite. "Projected efficiency" is what 
he calls this systematic preparation, genera- 
tions ahead, for some prospective issue. 

This is all very well, but it hardly justifies 
the author in looking upon so slender a revela- 
tion as an important discovery, since it is

almost as commonplace and matter-of-fact 
an observation as an evolutionist can make. 
People who have not the thinking habit may 
consider " projected efficiency " a very great 
addition to the terms which science has created 
as expressions of order and plan in the uni- 
verse. But whatever may be said about the 
term, the idea that the present lives for the 
future has been in men's minds from the be- 
ginning, and consciously recognised as para- 
mount in all creation. " Go to the ant and be 
wise," — what does the ant do but build and 
burrow and slave for its progeny ? And the 
humblest as well as the proudest of mortals, 
does he not do likewise ? Yet to the proving 
of this somewhat trite proposition Mr. Kidd 
devotes several chapters. 

His answer to the question. What kind of 
efficiency will prevail in the future? is but 
little more satisfactory. In the twentieth cen- 
tury he sees, as the future prevailing type, the 
type organized towards " military efficiency "; 
that is, let us say, the type having the most de- 
structive firearms and the most efficient explo- 
sives, — presumably those that discharge their 
deadly weapons by pressing the electric button ! 
It seems as if, after a repetition of types of the 
destructive kind from the. very beginning of 
things, we might expect in the present indus- 
trial era at least some slight variation. If Mr. 
Kidd had pointed out as the surviving type the 
one which could most advantageously close a 
bargain, we should have been able to point to 
this as something new if not more attractive ; 
or if he had said that the survivor was to be the 
one who could subsist the longest on the least, 
we should have seen the logical conclusion in 
the struggle for existence and the survival of 
the fittest. 

Mr. Kidd appears to use historical incidents 
to fit his purpose just as freely as Mr. Spencer 
whom he censures, and he is far less explicit 
and direct in his explanation of them. For 
example, when Mr. Kidd has pointed to the 
circumstance that life is sacred in the modern 
state as it never was in the ancient, he pro- 
ceeds to explain this by the assumption that 
*' in the last resort, the life of the individual 
is related to ends and principles which entirely 
transcend the objects for which the political 
organization around us itself exists." The 
plainer explanation would be that the under- 
standing of the ends and principles which trans- 
cend the objects referred to is due to religious 
belief in a future existence, which in the first 
place awakens responsibility. But such plain 



statements are not Mr. Kidd's strong point ; 
he likes circumventions. Sweeping assertions 
and generalities are, as of old, the besetting sin 
of the evolutionists who attain to philosophical 
breadth of view. Incidentally there are many 
interesting remarks made in the book. Mr. 
Kidd is at his best in his parentheses ; but the 
really decisive statements and arguments are 
lost in the general melee of explanations, re- 
iterations, and references to something else, 
which make the reader impatient for a bit of 
plain reasoning. We hope some day to see 
an abridged edition of Mr. Kidd's works, in 
which some of the evils of style and method 
here complained of shall have been eliminated.

Ellen Terry and her Sisters.* 

Two years ago this month we had occasion 
to review in these columns an authentic life of 
" The Kendals," by Mr. T. Edgar Pemberton. 
To those interested in the history of the con- 
temporary stage the volume proved particularly 
welcome. The author has now given us a com- 
panion volume entitled " Ellen Terry and her 
Sisters," in which a number of biographical de- 
tails not hitherto obtainable have been grouped 
together with considerable skill, making a story 
which reads easily and consecutively. 

Miss Terry has for many years been termed 
by some the greatest living Shakespearian 
actress. Mr. Pemberton's timely memoir re- 
veals to us much of her inner life, and traces 
her outward history ; shows us the influences 
under which she grew up and developed, — the 
traits of her character^ early and strongly 
manifested, — and follows her theatrical career 
from her maiden effort at the age of six years, 
through its successive stages down to the hey- 
day of a most eventful life. 

It was while Mr. and Mrs. Ben Terry were 
fulfilling an engagement at Coventry that their 
daughter Ellen Terry was born. This was on 
February 27, 1848, and a little feud has taken 
place among the people of that interesting 
" City of Three Tall Spires " as to the precise 
house in which the important event took place. 
The child made her earliest (though childish) 
successes with Charles Kean in a famous series 
of Shakespearian revivals. Miss Terry has said : 

" It must be remembered that my sister aud I had 
the advantage of exceedingly clever and conscientious

parents, who spared no pains to bring out and perfect 
any talents we possessed. My father was a charming 
elocutionist, and my mother read Shakspeare beauti- 
fully, and then both were very fond of us and saw our 
faults with eyes of love, though they were unsparing in 
their corrections. And, indeed, they had need of all 
their patience, for, for my own part, I know I was a 
most troublesome, wayward pupil." 

It has always been conceded that the stock 
company is the practical school of dramatic 
art. It was in the Bristol Stock Company 
that Miss Terry received her early training, 
— and " the firing of the clay brought out 
the colors of the porcelain, and the colors 
lasted." It was merely a West of England 
stock company, but it could boast of such a 
constellation of names as Madge Robertson 
(Mrs. Kendal), Marie Wilton (Lady Ban- 
croft), Henrietta Hodson (Mrs. Labouchere), 
Kate and EllenTerry, George Melville, Arthur 
Stirling, W. H. Vernon, Arthur Wood, and 
Charles Coghlan. 

In 1867 Ellen Terry became the wife of 
Mr. Charles Wardell — known to playgoers 
as Charles Kelly, the name he adopted when, 
retiring from his position as an officer in a 
first-class cavalry regiment, he followed his in- 
clinations and took to the stage. She then 
retired from public life for seven years, re- 
turning in 1874 and acting continually up to 
the present day. It was while appearing with 
John Hare in " Olivia " — the stage version of 
Oliver Goldsmith's immortal story, "The Vicar 
of Wakefield " — that Henry Irving invited her 
to be his helpmate in his management of the 
Lyceum Theater. As Mr. Pemberton says, 
it is not surprising that she should say, after 
that memorable engagement : 

" I seem to have made J;he acquaintance and to know 
quite intimately some noble people — Hamlet and 
Ophelia, Portia, Benedict and Beatrice, Romeo and 
Juliet, Viola, the Macbeths. All this makes me rejoice 
and wonder how it is that I'm not a superior person! 
I have dwelt with such very good company. It has 
been all sunshine, with a wee cloud here and there to 
give zest to life; and my lines have been laid in pleas- 
ant places." 

Her cause was won ; all England had learned 
that a star of the first magnitude had risen to 
the zenith of the dramatic heavens. 

Of late years the work of Ellen Terry has 
become as familiar to the American public as 
to the English. The annual engagements of 
Henry Irving and his co-star have been num- 
bered among the triumphs of each theatrical 
season. As Volumnia in " Coriolanus," Cla- 
rice de Malucon in ♦' Robespierre," and Queen 
Guinevere in Comyns Carr's drama of " King 



Arthur," her recent triumphs have been com- 
plete. In personating a character she identifies 
herself so entirely with her part that her face 
seems to flush or pale with the varying excite- 
ment of her character. Whatever the senti- 
ment or situation of the moment, everything 
that goes to make up the ensemble of the actress 
moves and speaks in unison ; so that, whether 
portraying the complex emotions of life, or the 
convergent subsidence of death, she is, in look, 
voice, and attitude, the living, vibrant, imper- 
sonation of her theme. 

It has been pointed out that the artistic tem- 
perament must be more or less self-tormenting, 
and those who desire mere personal comfort 
should never attempt to cultivate it. Despite 
her success, Ellen Terry often feels that she 
has failed where enthusiastic audiences, and 
even the most captious critics, testify to the 
fact that she has triumphed. Yet how com- 
mendable it is that she should feel that any 
seeming victory in human life is not a final 
achievement, but a spur — often a cruel one — 
to endless endeavor. " Success," says George 
William Curtis, " is a delusion. It is an attain- 
ment — but who attains? It is the horizon, 
always bounding our path and therefore never 
gained. The Pope,, triple-crowned, and borne 
with flabella through St. Peter's, is not success- 
ful — for he might be canonized into a saint. 
Pygmalion, before his perfect statue, is not 
successful — for it might live. Raphael, fin- 
ishing the Sistene Madonna, is not successful, — 
for her beauty has revealed to him a finer and 
an unattainable beauty." 

Aside from Ellen Terry, Mr. Pemberton has 
devoted considerable space in his book to her 
three gifted sisters, Kate, Florence, and Marion, 
each of whom has won a distinctive place in 
English theatrical history, but whose names 
are unfamiliar in this country. Kate Terry's 
name is frequently heard associated with that 
of Charles Fechter, and there is little doubt 
that she contributed largely to Fechter's early 
Lyceum successes ; she married early, and re- 
tired into private life. Marion Terry is yet 
charming English playgoers with her clever 
and conscientious work; she has frequently 
shared honors with George Alexander, Charles 
Wyndham, Forbes Robertson, and the Ban- 
crofts. Of Florence Terry, who died in 1896, 
Mr. Clement Scott said : " She is one of the 
very few actresses I have known who has never 
gone back from her gentle career of continued 
success."

there is always a tendency on the part of the 
author to dip his pen in rainbows and honey ; 
but when an artist has gained so high a place 
in the estimation of the public as has Ellen 
Terry, praise which at first may appear ex- 
travagant is warranted by the general verdict 
of approval. Mr. Pemberton has wisely sup- 
plemented his own records by extracts from 
contemporary authors ; and on the whole his 
is a well-made biography, revealing quite fre- 
quently the writer's familiarity with the stage 
and its history. The volume is adequately 
illustrated and attractively printed and bound.

Crumbs from the Psychologist's 
Tabltc.* 



Professor James Mark Baldwin has gath- 
ered together, in a volume entitled " Fragments 
in Philosophy and Science," a number of essays 
and addresses which were "scattered during 
fifteen years in various journals." The bond 
of unity between them is the writer's individ- 
uality ; he offers, as it were, samples of him- 
self. In a prefatory note he gives us his " per- 
sonal signboard," — his type of philosophy — 
in a few clearly-worded sentences. 

" Science tells us what is true. . . . Philosophy then 
enters her questions : how can such truth be also good, 
beautiful, livable — or none of these? While others 
say other things, and many others many other things, 
I say — using the liberty of this preface — it is true 
and good because it is beautiful. . . . The ascription of 
beauty, a reasoned, criticised, thought-out ascription of 
aesthetic quality, is the final form of our thought about 
nature, naan, the world, the All." 

We are not told, however, what constitutes 
beauty. Perhaps we may say that beauty is 
harmony realized objectively ; happiness is har- 
mony realized subjectively. So, then, our phi- 
losophy sees harmony in truth, and ultimately 
no two or more truths can conflict. From the 
complete realization of truth would come per- 
fect happiness, and a perfect sense of beauty ; 
but these would be attributes of God. 

Professor Baldwin pleads well and strongly 
for the recognition of philosophy in education, 
and herein, perhaps, is the chief value of the 
book. Specialists in the sciences have been 
content to take a narrow view, and it is even 
held against a man that he has philosophical 
opinions. We have studied bricks, but have no 
conception of a house. We are as learned as 

* Fragments in Philosophy and Science. By James 
Mark Baldwin. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. 



the dictionary, and as inchoate. We hold a 
million threads, that lead we know not whither. 
It is the duty of philosophy to harmonize all 
these elements, to show us the beauty of the 
cosmos, and our place therein. The ultimate 
purpose of science is to make possible a true 
philosophy. 

Furthermore, says our author, philosophy is 
not an intellectual toy, it is a means of under- 
standing the problems of human life. Every 
man has to solve those problems, one way or 
another ; and whether he knows it or not, he 
solves them by his philosophy. What, then, 
if his philosophy is false ? What is the use of 
training thousands of young men and women 
yearly in our universities, if they come out 
without a sound and coherent philosophy ? For 
all their knowledge of concrete realities, they 
will be as chaff blown by the wind. 

This, then, is what the psychologist has to 
tell us ; but we venture to think that his mes- 
sage comes from deeper than psychological 
considerations. It should be the message of 
every scientific man who is not afraid to trust 
his mind out of his sight. Psychology is a 
science, and, as such, stands in the same rela- 
tion to philosophy as all the other sciences ; 
the psychologist can hardly be conceded a spe- 
cial right-of-way into the philosophical halls. 

Suppose that we are standing in an old 
cathedral, and looking upwards at the image 
of a saint in a stained-glass window. What 
is actually taking place ? The physicist tells us 
that rays of light, more correctly called undu- 
lations of the ether, are passing through the 
glass and reaching our eyes. These undula- 
tions have different wave-lengths, whereby they 
are said to be red, blue, yellow, and so forth. 
The result is an image of the saint. But what 
have rays of light to do with saints ? Nothing 
whatever, until our mind intervenes and inter- 
prets. The physiologist will now explain how 
the light, entering the eye, really goes no further 
than the retina, but there sets up a disturbance 
which is communicated to the brain. But what 
has this disturbance to do with saints ? The 
psychologist will now show that the result of 
the changes transmitted along the optic nerve 
is a sensation, or bundle of sensations, which 
we call vision, — the vision of a picture of a 
saint. So much for the science of the phe- 
nomenon ; but have we yet a philosophy of it? 
Can it be said that all this really explains our 
conscious perception of the saint's figure, and 
our receipt thereby of a message from the man, 
long since dead, who first imagined it ? Psy-

chology, as a science, deals objectively with the 
phenomena of the mind, and does not itself 
construct a philosophy, — though, like every 
other science, it affords materials on which 
philosophy must be based. 

To return to the volume before us ; it con- 
sists in large measure of contributions to, or 
discussions of, the science of psychology. The 
term " science " in the title is to be interpreted 
" psychology." The close relationship between 
physiology and psychology is clearly indicated, 
and has even given rise to the term " Physio- 
logical Psychology." Experiment is taking the 
place of speculation, and thus bottom is found 
in what formerly seemed to many a fathomless 
quicksand. Interesting accounts are given of 
the manner of the experiments, and some of the 
results. In general, one admires the scientific 
attitude of the experimenters, and wonders at 
their ingenuity. Here and there, some further 
explanation seems desirable. On page 185 
Professor Baldwin says : " My child H. cried 
out when I pinched a bottle-cork in her fifth 
month, and wept bitterly, in her twenty-second 
week, at the sight of a picture of a man with 
bowed head and feet in stocks." We must be 
forgiven for suggesting that the child's emotion 
was the result of a conscious or unconscious ex- 
pression on the face of the experimenter, and 
could have been produced just as well without 
the cork or the picture. So again, in chapter 
XIII. are detailed experiments with large 
classes of students in judging between squares 
of different sizes, or, rather, in remembering 
the sizes of particular squares. It does not 
appear that any account is taken of the dis- 
tance of the observer from the object, nor of 
the tendency to make random guesses when the 
squares shown were really of the same size. 
In the latter case, it will be observed, there are 
three possible alternatives, only one of which 
is correct, and there is a probability of one of 
the others being chosen. Some indication of 
this cause of error is given on page 249. 

It seems a little late in the day to republish 
an essay on " Contemporary Philosophy in 
France " written in 1887, and an account of 
the condition of psychology at the time of the 
Chicago Exposition of 1893. The average 
reader of the book is not likely to be able to 
mentally compare the conditions portrayed 
with those now extant ; and so will lose their 
historical interest, while unsatisfied by such 
belated accounts of the subjects discussed.

Some American 



Those who have gone well into the 

master-painters. ™*"®^ *^*t "^^kes the subject of 

Mr. Charles H. Caffin's book en- 
titled '< American Masters of Painting " (Double- 
day) will find a striking similarity between the 
conclusions that he has reached and their own ; 
while those who have no special knowledge of this 
kind of art, and view it from without, will find Mr. 
Caffin's attitude of mind about it a very reasonable 
one. It is rather to these last — the many — than 
to the specially informed few, that the author ad- 
dresses himself ; and it is the unique distinction of 
his book that it presents a closely analytical and 
even technical study of its subject, in terms that 
are quite intelligible to people who know nothing 
about this kind of artistic procedure. Opinion about 
art must be more than expert to be convincing. 
The one who offers it must show that he has thought 
outside of the particular field of the art he is 
writing about. This it is clear the author has done, 
and his conclusions are those more secure ones 
which come from this kind of thinking. But it is 
evident also that he understands the usages as well 
as the function of painting; and while his premises 
are the larger ones of the mind, the critical struc- 
ture of his work will also be acceptable to special- 
ized culture, and be found in harmony with the 
laws that govern picture-making. Moreover, the 
book makes delightful reading, and is as pleasant 
to the taste as it is convincing to the understanding. 
The selection of the thirteen " masters " is no more 
arbitrary than is inevitable in the best of such dis- 
tinctions when applied to contemporary art. The 
painters whose genius and work are the subjects of 
the thirteen brief essays — averaging thirty-five 
hundred words each — that make up the volume 
of two hundred pages, are at least quite worthy of 
the close study that Mr. Caffin has made of them, 
and in the strictly relative sense implied by the 
title may be fitly named " masters." They are in 
their order — an order which seems on the whole 
to give proper precedence — George Inness, John 
La Farge, James A. McNeill Whistler, John Singer 
Sargent, Winslow Homer, Edwin A. Abbey, George 
Fuller, Homer D. Martin, George De Forest Brush, 
Alexander H. Wyant, Dwight W. Tryon, Horatio 
Walker, and Gilbert Stuart. Without any dis- 
guise of technical verbiage, but in words that un- 
cover his meaning to those unversed in art's special 
nomenclature, the writer makes a searching analysis 
of the art of these men. Avoiding the generalities 
that are the refuge -of vague thought, and that, 
while applicable, fail to distinguish the individual 
genius, he gives to each of the thirteen who are 
the subjects of his " appreciations " his own proper 
place, marking his particular gift in such a way that 
it cannot be confused with any other. Those who 
look upon a painting as a piece of handicraft, a 
more or less deft application of pigment to a flat

surface, rather than as an index to an intelligence, 
will probably find the work too subjective in its 
analysis ; while those who read a picture less in its 
own terms than in those of the mind that is in it 
will find the volume illuminating. From this point 
of view, it seems as interpretative of what is best in 
American painting as a work of such limited scope 
can be. 

Mr. Francis Watt is evidently not 
of Froude's opinion as to the un- 
wisdom of whitewashing the villains 
of tradition. In " The Terrors of the Law " (Lane) 
he seeks to show the human and more amiable side 
of Bloody Jeffreys, the Bluidy Advocate Mackenzie, 
and Lord Braxfield, the original of Stevenson's 
Weir of Hermiston. The point of view is announced 
as not legal, but " human or literary." Law, how- 
ever, has ever been accounted a jealous mistress, 
and broad interests or wide culture would seem to 
retard rather than promote the advancement of the 
ambitious jurist. Hence the dearth of material for 
popular sketches of these famous, or rather infa- 
mous, judges. Jeffreys — who has already been 
whitewashed with no lack of zeal and some degree 
of success by Mr. H. B. Irving — makes a better 
showing than Mackenzie ; but the tang of Brax- 
field's rough Scotch humor renders him the most 
piquantly interesting of the three. The author 
tries to view each of his characters from the stand- 
point of a contemporary, and so to temper the 
judgment of a more refined and enlightened age. 
His defense of Jeffreys furnishes little that is new 
to a reader of Irving's book ; but it should be here 
added that Mr. Watt, and not Mr. Irving, is the 
pioneer in this field, the former having first pub- 
lished his article in " The New Review " two years 
before the latter's work appeared. The sketch of 
Braxfield is, the author believes, the fullest account 
of the man yet published. It also first saw the 
light in "The New Review." The paper on 
Mackenzie appeared originally in "The Anglo- 
Saxon Review." These matters of fact are set 
forth in the preface. Kneller's portraits of Jeff- 
reys and Mackenzie, and Raeburn's likeness of 
Braxfield, are reproduced, but necessarily on too 
small a scale for the best effect. The delicacy and 
beauty of Jeffreys's features, as limned by Kneller, 
will never cease to surprise. Possibly this artist 
was too much of " an utterer of smooth things in 
paint." 

The last quarter-century has given 
^^XVreiigion. ^^^ ^tudy of religion as a science a 

recognized place in the curricula of 
several great universities. " The Study of Religion " 
(Scribner), by Professor Morris Jastrow, Jr., is a 
laudable attempt to unfold a method of procedure. 
In order to take up his subject in the right way, he 
first gives a brief history of the study itself. This 
presents and emphasizes the historical methods as 
of first importance. We have next the classifica- 
tion of religions, the definitions and the character 



of it, and a discussion of its origin. In the some- 
what elaborate treatment of this last theme, the 
author decides that the historical study of religions 
cannot prove that there was a primitive revelation. 
He also shows that neither the " animistic " theory 
of Prof. E. B. Tylor, nor the "ghost" theory of 
Mr. Herbert Spencer, provides ample explanation 
of the origfin of religion. The mere personification 
of nature, too, seems to him to lack a certain spir- 
itual element which appears to be essential to the 
rise of a genuine religious feeling in man. Briefly, 
his position is that " the origin of religion, so far 
as historical study can solve the problem, is to be 
sought in the bringing into play of man's power to 
obtain a perception of the Infinite through the im- 
pression which the multitudinous phenomena of the 
universe as a whole make upon him" (p. 196). 
This last statement involves man's power of study- 
ing and explaining the phenomena about him, and 
hence of several departments of modern thought. 
Consequently the second division of the volume 
deals with religion in its relation to ethics, to phi- 
losophy, to mythology, to psychology, to history, 
and to culture in general, — and to these in the 
newest phases of their development. The last 
division of the book takes up practical aspects of 
the question. The general attitude of the student 
must be sympathetic ; he must enter into the life of 
the peoples who profess belief in such and such re- 
ligion, if he is to be most proficient in explaining 
its phenomena. He must also be able to study the 
sources, whether in literature or in the life of any 
people, as only thereby will he be able to speak 
authoritatively and to estimate values properly. 
The work is provided with an excellent biblio- 
graphy of the various phases of the theme, and an 
ample index.

o great work in ciples of Political Economy " (Mac-

witnesses. The first volume dealt with Production 
and Distribution ; the second with Exchange. This 
last volume treats of Economic Progress and the 
Economic Functions of Government. Economic 
students are to be congratulated on the completion 
of this scholarly and practical work. The volume 
under discussion follows the usual method of Pro- 
fessor Nicholson, whose treatment is that of a pro- 
gressive conservative, and who blends admirably 
the methods of his masters. Smith and Mill. The 
analysis of Progress, in its relation to Population, 
Money, Prices, Rent, Profits, and Wages, is very 
good; although Production, Distribution, and Ex- 
change fill the field too completely, to the exclusion 
of Consumption. This latter gets due recognition, 
however, under the discussion of the Functions of 
Government, especially in the masterly balancing 
of forces between Individualism and Governmental 
Interference. The author's conservatism is more

suspicious of the latter than of the former ; and the 
same attitude of mind appears in the chapter on 
Free Trade and Protection. The presentation of 
Taxation, Public Expenditure and Public Credit is 
helpfully up to date. One of the most interesting 
chapters is that on Colonies and Dependencies, 
where the doctrine of Imperial Federation is pre- 
sented in the light of the Boer war, and we are 
told as a final word that " instead of seeking to 
tighten ties, the ideal should be to enlarge the sym- 
pathies." This book must be the standard work in 
English for some years to come. 

A reprint ^®^ pieces of autobiographical writ- 

o/ Fielding's ing in English literature have quite 

last work. ^^^ charm and pathetic interest that 

attaches to Fielding's posthumous "Journal of a 
Voyage to Lisbon." "Written in the last year of 
the novelist's life, during a period of the most 
intense physical suffering, this record of a vain 
pilgrimage in search of health yet exhibits Fielding 
perhaps at his best as far as writing goes, and is 
animated by a spirit of humor and courage as un- 
failing as that which moves in the pages of " Tom 
Jones " or "Joseph Andrews." " One of the most 
unfeigned and touching little tracts in our own 
or any other literature," Mr. Austin Dobson has 
rightly characterized the Journal. To have this 
work in the beautiful setting just given it by 
Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. at the Riverside 
Press is a piece of good fortune for which book- 
lovers should be duly grateful. The volume is 
an octavo of something over two hundred pages, 
printed upon Dickinson handmade paper from a 
new font of type of uncommon attractiveness. 
The typographical treatment of the text is severely 
simple, and with the exception of a photogravure 
reproduction of Hogarth's portrait (the only au- 
thentic likeness of Fielding in existence) there is 
a total absence of extraneous embellishment or 
decoration in the book. Its distinction rests en- 
tirely upon a basis of sound taste and correct 
workmanship, — a combination which must always 
achieve the best results. This tasteful reprint of 
Fielding's last work is issued in a limited edition 
of three hundred copies, all of which, we understand, 
were taken up in advance of publication. 

The present tendency of scientific 
Geography of investigation is not so much in the 

the British Tsles. ,° • i- . 

direction of speciahzing as in treat- 
ing the various departments of science synthetically. 
This is admirably illustrated by H. J. Mackinder's 
"Britain and the British Seas" (Appleton), the 
initial volume of a series under Mr. Mackinder's 
editorship and intended to present descriptive es- 
says of twelve great natural regions of the earth. 
Mr. Mackinder is a geographer, and " Reader in 
Geography in the University of Oxford." But with 
him, geography is far more than what the school- 
boys of half a century were taught, — " a descrip- 
tion of the earth's surface." Mr. Mackinder's pur- 



suit of his favorite science has led him far beneath 
the surface of the earth and over a wide expanse of 
the North Atlantic Ocean. He finds it to include 
astronomical or mathematical geography, and a 
knowledge of the processes by which the world came 
into being ; and he recognizes its relation to geol- 
ogy, and that it is divisible into the several depart- 
ments of racial, historical, strategetic and economic 
geography. The British Isles comprise the small- 
est of the twelve natural divisions selected for this 
scientific treatment, but their physical features are 
so thoroughly known that they furnish an admir- 
able subject for a leader in this proposed series of 
geographical syntheses. The volume sets a stand- 
ard which the authors of the subsequent volumes 
will find it difficult to maintain ; but if the other 
volumes are anything like this in breadth of treat- 
ment, the value of the series as contributions to our 
knowledge of the world will be beyond estimation. 
Maps in color and in black-and-white, and notes 
and indexes, are so generously supplied that they 
more than illustrate the subject — they illuminate it. 

In translating Professor Friedrich 
Life and doetrmes Paulgen's "Life and Doctrines of 

of Immanuel Kant. ^,,/c< -l \ -kit 

ImmanuelKant (ocribner), Messrs. 
Creighton and Lefevre, of Cornell University, have 
done an invaluable service to English students of 
the great German metaphysician. The book aims 
to set forth the central doctrines of the Kantian 
system, laying especial stress upon the often neg- 
lected constructive side of the philosophy, upon its 
positive and idealistic elements and its lofty moral 
concepts. The short but significant introduction 
deals with Kant's position, first in the history of 
philosophical thought, and next in the thought of 
his own time. A brief account of his life and 
mental development follows ; and finally an expo- 
sition of his system, which occupies three-fourths of 
the book. Intended especially for the student who 
is attempting a systematic mastery of the Critiques, 
this section is still not beyond the depth of the gen- 
eral reader, while its abundant divisions and head- 
ings make it particularly useful for consultation 
upon some one doctrine or some small division of 
Kant's work. The author's appreciation of Kant's 
great contribution to modern thought does not blind 
him to idiosyncrasies of form or inconsistencies of 
content. So his book is of value both as an expo- 
sition of Kant's work and as an authoritative opinion 
of it based upon the results of recent Kantian 
studies in Germany. 

Mr. Thomas E. Watson's life of 
Napoleon (Macmillan), which suc- 
ceeds his " Story of France " and is 
uniform with it in style and size of volume, will be 
no disappointment to the admirers of the earlier 
effort. The author has emphatically disclaimed 
recourse to new material, or the attempt to put new 
facts before the public. His life of Napoleon is 
based wholly on many well-known, easily accessible,

but sometimes notoriously unauthoritative sources. 
Mr. Watson's powers of discrimination have not 
been expended in eliminating the false and untrust- 
worthy, but rather in culling out the dull and occa- 
sionally the damning facts of his hero's career. 
For Napoleon is the hero, and the attitude of the 
author is that of the champion and defender against 
the taken-for-granted malignancy of his reader. 
Mr. Watson, however, is never more wholly himself, 
never more successful, than when in arms for a 
favorite theory or character ; so we have him at 
his best. The story of the life of Napoleon is ex- 
ceedingly well told in the always attractive style of 
the author, whose forcible personality is constantly 
in evidence. There is endless interesting gossip, 
bright characterization, eloquent denunciation or 
vindication, as the case demands. For the general 
reader we have, then, an uncommonly attractive life 
of Napoleon, even if the author has failed to give 
us history for the historian. 

Methods for the No branch of anatomical investiga- 
ttudyofthe tion has made more rapid advances 

nervou!^ syHem. j^ recent years than the study of the 
nervous system. This rapid growth in the science 
of neurology has been almost wholly conditioned 
by the discovery of new methods of research which 
have opened new fields for exploration and corrected 
the misconceptions of the past. The nervous sys- 
tem is one of the moat complicated in the vertebrate 
body, and a knowledge of its architecture is of great 
importance not only to physicians but also to anat- 
omists, zoologists, physiologists, and psychologists. 
All of these classes will welcome Mr. Hardesty's 
little manual of methods, "Neurological Technique " 
(Chicago University Press). This is the outgrowth 
of experience in the neurological laboratory of the 
University of Chicago, and is designed to meet the 
needs of all who would attempt the study of the 
gross or finer structure of the nervous system by 
modern methods. To obviate the confusion which 
has arisen in anatomical literature from the use of 
various names for the same structure, the author 
has adopted the nomenclature recommended by the 
Basel Commission of Anatomists, and gives a full 
list of the terms applicable to the nervous system 
and sense organs. 



The life and 
■art-work of 
Mr. WhUller, 



In the volume entitled " James Mc- 
Neill Whistler, the Man and his 
Work" (Mansfield), Mr. W. G. 
Bowdoin presents a brief and well-written sketch of 
the principal facts of the painter's life, a collection 
of characteristic anecdotes, and a list of Whistler 
prints in the Avery Collection at the Lenox Library. 
But it is refined harmony of page, binding, and 
illustration of the book that first catches the eye, 
and makes the most lasting impression. Mounted 
on heavy dark-brown paper and bound in at the 
end of the book are half-tone reproductions of some 
of Mr. Whistler's most interesting pictures ; and 
similarly mounted as a frontispiece is a repro- 



duction of the well-known portrait of Whistler by 
Mendelssohn. The numerous Whistler controver- 
sies are here barely alluded to. With the pen as 
well as with the brush, Mr. Whistler has been one 
of the great forces in contemporary art, and this 
book is welcome for its presentation of his peculiar 
and abiding influence. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The English-Spanish section of the revised Veldsquez 
Dictionary has just been published by the Messrs. Ap- 
pleton, following the other section after an interval of 
about a year. The editors are Messrs. Edward Gray 
and Juan L. Iribas. We open it at random, and come 
upon such definitions as "copper, va. en el juege de 
foradn, etc." and " dude, s. petimetre," from which 
examples the thoroughness of the work may be judged. 
This is undoubtedly the best dictionary of Spanish and 
English now in existence. 

" The International Year Book " for 1901, the fourth 
annual issue of this useful work of reference, has just 
been published by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. It is 
edited, as before, by Mr. Frank Moore Colby, with the 
collaboration of Professor H. T. Peck and Mr. E. L. 
Engle. The plan remains substantially unchanged, 
although certain classes of statistical matter relating to 
the States have been made into special articles, instead 
of being scattered in forty-five places. A great deal 
of census material, as well as of legislative enactment, 
has been made use of in this volume. There are a 
dozen maps, and thirty or forty other plates. The in- 
dex, which is cumulative, becomes more and more 
valuable with every year. 

" The " Warwick Library " is a series that has for 
some time numbered six volumes, and to these a seventh 
has just been added, the work of Professor C. H. Her- 
ford, the editor of the series. Each volume of this 
library, it will be remembered, deals with one literary 
form in English literature, which is illustrated by a 
number of examples, prefaced by an elaborate intro- 
ductory essay. " English Tales in Verse " is the sub- 
ject of the new volume, which is imported by the Messrs. 
Scribner, The authors represented are Chaucer, Shake- 
speare, Dryden, Crabbe, Wordsworth, Keats, and Mor- 
ris, there being sixteen tales in all, five of them Chau- 
cerian. As might be expected by those who are 
familiar with the editor's writing, the introductory essay 
is a fine example of readable and discriminating literary 
criticism. 

The second volume of " Main Currents in Nineteenth 
Century Literature " (Macmillan), by Dr. Georg Bran- 
des, has just appeared in the English version. This 
volume has for its special subject " The Romantic 
School in Germany," and was first published in 1873. 
Being based upon fundamental principles of criticism, 
instead of reflecting temporary fashions, it is practically 
as valuable to-day as it was thirty years ago. The 
movement described is that in which Tieck and the 
Schlegels, " Jean Paul " and " Novalis," Schleiermacher 
and Schelling, are the representative figures. The 
treatment of " Novalis," in particular, is one of the 
most penetrating pieces of criticism ever penned. The 
subject of the volume next to follow is " The Reaction 
in France."

text, provided with the customary apparatus, is pub- 
lished by Messrs. B. H. Sanborn & Co. 

" In the Days of Giants," by Miss Abbie Farwell 
Brown, is an illustrated book of Norse tales told in 
simple language for the delight of children. It is pub-

York. The term begins July 15 and closes August 20. 

Messrs. Houghton, MifQin & Co. are the publishers 
of " Our Country's Story," by Miss Eva March Tappan. 
The book is an elementary history of the United States, 
told for young students, and plentifully furnished with 
pictures. 

" The Story of Animal Life," by Mr. B. Lindsay, is 
published by the Messrs. Appleton in their " Library of 
Useful Stories." It is a popular statement of system- 
atic zoology, prepared for general reading rather than 
for school use. 

The " Dramatic and Early Poems " of Matthew Ar- 
nold, edited by Mr. H. Buxton Forman, and Carlyle's 
" Past and Present," edited by Mr. Oliphant Smeaton, 
are two welcome volumes in the Dent-Macmillan series 
of " Temple Classics." 

The " Elements of Physics " just published by 
Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. is the work of Messrs. 
Amos T. Fisher and Melvin J. Patterson. It is a very 
elementary book, suited for grammar schools rather 
than for those of higher grade. 

Mr. Buel P. Colton's " Elementary Physiology and 
Hygiene," published by Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co., is 
a text-book for young students, vitiated, as most such 
books are, by a distorted and unscientific treatment of 
the effects of alcohol and tobacco. 

Messrs. Fords, Howard, & Hulbert have just issued 
a new edition of Mr. Albion W. Tourgee's popular 
novel " A Fool's Errand," which had a great vogue 
twenty years ago, and remains one of the most enter- 
taining stories of the Reconstruction period. 

Mr. William S. Lord, Evanston, publishes an attrac- 
tive volume of " Love-Story Masterpieces," chosen by 
Mr. Ralph A. Lyon. The stories are four in number, 
Stevenson's " The Sire de Mal^troit's door being the 
only one of the four to have an independent existence. 
The other three are extracts from books, " The Auto- 
crat and the Schoolmistress," by Dr. Holmes, " A 
• Dream-Life ' Love-Story," by Mr. Donald G. Mit- 
chell, and Mr. Meredith's immortal " Idyl of First 



Love " from " Richard Feverel." Brown ink and brown 
board covers give a touch of individuality to this 
pretty book. 

" A Spanish Grammar with Exercises," by Professor 
M. Montrose Ramsey, although a thick book, is essen- 
tially elementary and designed to meet the needs of 
beginners. It is a revision, at once simplified and ex« 
panded, of the author's earlier " Text-Book of Modern 
Spanish." 

••The Government: What It Is, What It Does," by 
Mr. Salter Storrs Clark, is an elementary school text- 
book published by the American Book Co. It is a 
book that covers a good deal of ground in a simple 
way, and has several features not common in texts of 
this sort. 

•* Essentials of Chemistry for Secondary Schools," by 
Messrs. John C. Hessler and Albert L. Smith, is a text- 
book just published by Messrs. B. H. Sanborn & Co. 
The book combines description with laboratory guidance 
in a very practical way. With the exception of a brief 
chapter on the compounds of carbon, the subject of the 
book is inorganic chemistry.
