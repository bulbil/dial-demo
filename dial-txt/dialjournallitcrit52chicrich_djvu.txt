THE FIRST CITIZEN OF THE 
REPUBLIC. 

For many years it was the custom of John 
Bigelow to keep k ' open house " for his friends 
on Thanksgiving Day, in the fine old Gramercy 
Park mansion which had long been his home. 
It was a pleasant way, both for him and his 
guests, to celebrate his birthday, which fell on 
the twenty-fifth of November. What proved to 
be the last of these gatherings was held a month 
ago, ushering in the ninety-fifth year of the life 
of the venerable host. He died on the nine- 
teenth of December, after an illness of three 
days, unexpectedly at least in the sense that 
a man who has carried his intellectual and phy- 
sical vigor far into the nineties may well keep 
on surprising the world indefinitely. The tale 
of his accumulated years, and of the honors that 
had been their fruit, had made him " the first 
citizen of New York," as he was often styled, 
possibly even the most distinguished citizen of the 
nation which had long been proud of his fame. 
He had lived in the lifetime of George III., 
Napoleon, and every President except Washing- 
ton ; as a boy he had witnessed Lafayette's tri- 
umphal progress through the country he had 
helped to call into being, and had grown up 
among men to whom Bunker Hill was a per- 
sonal memory ; as a man, he had witnessed the 
transformation of Europe into a continent of 
constitutional governments, and of his own coun- 
try into the most powerful and prosperous na- 
tion on earth ; he had seen such younger men 
as Hale and Higginson and Mitchell die of old 
age, and still he lived on in a world which by 
means of his vital personality was enabled to link 
the present with the far distant past. As was 
finely said by the newspaper which he helped to 
build up more than half a century ago, his dis- 
appearance now seems " like the fading from a 
familiar landscape of a snow-crowned mountain 
peak." 

John Bigelow was born November 25, 1817, 
at Maiden, New York, and was graduated from 
Union College in 1835. Three years later he 
was admitted to the bar, and combined a grow- 
ing practice with a multifarious literary activity. 
His support of Van Buren in the Free Soil Cam- 
paign of 1848 brought him to the attention of 
Bryant, who offered him an interest in the

[Jan. 1, 



" Evening Poet." The offer was accepted and 
Bigelow became one-third owner of the paper, 
greatly increasing its circulation and influence. 
At the outbreak of the Civil War he sold his 
interest to Parke Godwin, and went to Paris as 
American consul upon Lincoln's appointment. 
In 1 864 he was made American minister, hold- 
ing this post for three years. His public ser- 
vices were very great at this time of ticklish con- 
ditions in our affairs abroad ; he thwarted a 
French plot to furnish the Confederacy with 
ironclads, and he conducted the negotiations 
which put an end to Napoleon's piratical ven- 
ture in Mexican imperialism. He then lived in 
Germany for a number of years, concerned with 
the education of his children. Upon bis return 
to America, he was appointed by Governor 
Tilden to the State Canal Commission of New 
York, and was elected to the office of Secretary 
of State. His active life, in the sense of office- 
holding and money-getting, was now over, al- 
though many an honorary position was still to 
be thrust upon him. In the better sense, his 
activities were in full swing, and ceased only 
with his death. He says in his autobiography : 

" I was able to retire with a property which could not 
be fairly valued at less than $175,000. This was not a 
large fortune for a man in the middle of the journey of 
life to retire upon, even in those days. It now seems 
barely enough to begin life with. To me, however, it 
promised all that wealth could give me. The Golden 
Age, in my imagination then, was the age when gold 
did not reign." 

John Bigelow's association with Tilden was 
one of the most important things in his life, for 
it made him a trustee of the Tilden bequest, and 
for many years president of the library board. 
His acceptance of the new library building in 
May, 1911, marked his last appearance before 
the public. An equally impressive public appear- 
ance was that of the preceding December, when 
he made the address opening the joint session of 
the American Academy and the National Insti- 
tute upon the stage of the New Theatre. As ex- 
ecutor of Tilden's will, he also became his official 
biographer, publishing in several volumes the 
life, speeches, letters, and literary memorials of 
his old friend. A second literary task of major 
importance was the work done in connection 
with Franklin, which included the three-volume 
biography, the ten-volume edition of the writ- 
ings, and the authentic version of the autobiog- 
raphy, which had previously been published in 
a form sadly garbled as a result of the mistaken 
piety of Franklin's descendants. Among his 
other works may be mentioned a book on Jam- 
aica, a life of Fremont, a monograph on Glad- 



stone in his relations to our Civil War, Lrs 
Etats-Unis d'Ame'rique en 1863," a study of 
Molinos the Quietist, " France and the Confed- 
erate Navy," a life of Bryant, and a number of 
quaintly styled opusculu. stu-h as "Peace Given 
as the World Giveth," and "The Propriuiu, or 
What of Man Is Not His Own.'* It is a cata- 
logue of varied interest, extending to upwards of 
twenty titles, and nearly twice that number of 
volumes, certainly a sufficient reason for ac- 
cording the author an honorable place among 
our men of letters. 

Mr. Bigelow's religious affiliations were with 
the Swedenborgians, illustrating once more the 
curious appeal which the Swedish mystic made 
to many American minds of the finer type in 
the forties and fifties. In this ra>-. it was a 
chance acquaintance made in the West Indies 
that was the cause of the " conversion." " He 
lent me one of Swedenborg's books. I became 
so interested in^it that I read it without ceasing 
from ten o'clock in the morning until six o'clock 
that night. For twenty years thereafter I read 
Swedenborgian books many hours a day." In his 
political faith, Mr. Bigelow was a democrat of 
the old school, to which democracy meant con- 
servatism, and public economy, and financial 
integrity, and a rooted belief in free-trade. The 
protective policy was to him the sum of all iniqui- 
ties, and he punctured its fallacies in many a 
pungent phrase. The protective creed was for 
him a dogma in a republic only fit for a high- 
wayman, a fool, or a drunkard." His motto 
was Hamlet's "Reform it altogether," and the 
" revision downward " of the opportunist politi- 
cian was " an idle dream, as idle as baying the 
moon for rain. To expect a reduction of the 
tariff in this country is to expect a dipsomaniac 
to clamor for water instead of whiskey." It was 
only a year or two ago that he penned this tart 
reply to an appeal from the Reform Club that 
he should cooperate in their work : 

When your Reform Committee is prepared to take 
a firm stand against any tariff upon imports, 'to make 
every harbor on our sea coast as free to the commerce 
of the world as those of New York are to those of New 
Jersey, or those of Pennsylvania are to those of Virginia, 
I shall be happy to join you and do what I can to promote 
the success of your labors. In such a work 1 should 
have the satisfaction of knowing that I was not even 
indirectly countenancing a vicious system of taxation, 
also that I was helping to put our statesmen upon an in- 
quiry for sources of revenue that were not tainted with 
every cnme save murder, of which hi^iiwavuicn have 
ever been condemned by the laws of God or man." 

He could be tart upon other subjects also, as in 
the case of his letter to the committee in charge 
of the Hudson-Fulton celebration. He repre-

sented the indignant spirits of the men who were 
to be commemorated as thus speaking: 

" If you wish to honor us for what we have done to 
render this magnificent waterway useful, restore it to 
the condition in which we left it and when it was ready 
to appease the hunger and thirst of millions of people. 
Instead of that you have not given a thought or appro- 
priated a penny for the discharge of the first duty which 
our names should have prompted you to discharge. Your 
homage to our memory is a mockery, an insult, a subter- 
fuge for a Roman holiday, for panem et circenses. Take 
our names from your escutcheons and replace them with 
the names of the candidates whose political fortunes you 
are striving to promote. We have no longer anything 
in common with a city in which politics and prostitution 
are convertible terms." 

And he closed his epistle in this strain : 

" What a dance of death will be the procession up the 
Hudson of the Half Moon, not the original, but the 
counterfeit Half Moon, ' built in the eclipse and rigged 
with curses dark,' Mayor McClellan at its prow and the 
chairman of the Republican State Committee at the 
helm, and the aldermen who devised the Building Code 
in the steerage. ' Angels and ministers of grace defend 
us ! ' And so will the subscriber ever pray." 

The appearance of Mr. Bigelow's autobiog- 
raphy, about two years ago, was the publishing 
event of the season. It carried the narrative 
only part way, and the author was busy with 
its continuation up to his closing days. It is 
understood that a considerable addition to the 
original three volumes has been left practically 
ready for publication. For this, as for his other 
literary labors, his country will ever be grate- 
ful, but even more for the example of his life. 
Happy indeed is the man who can earn a mod- 
est competence, and then deliberately devote the 
rest of his years to objects which take no account 
of money, saying with our author : " I have com- 
plete independence and liberty now because I 
did that. I have done work for nothing without 
thinking about money for a long time." One 
could set himself no higher aim than this, 
coupling with it the cherishing of those graces 
of courtesy and simple dignity which made of 
John Bigelow so very fine a gentleman. 



SOME EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
TRA VELLERS IN AMERICA. 



I. 

" For a generation past," writes Professor Mc- 
Master in his " History of the People of the United 
States" referring to the year 1812 "it had been 
the fashion for English travellers in America on 
their return home to write books narrating their ad- 
ventures in the New World, and describing the man- 
ners, customs, usages, languages, peculiarities, and 



forms of government of the people." Fortunately, 
most of these writings are forgotten. " Whoever 
has travelled in foreign parts knows," as our his- 
torian observes, " that such descriptions are of little 
value"; and these particular volumes are no less 
ill-tempered than ignorant. And yet contemporary 
readers came to believe that, behind these attacks 
by travellers who had received a most generous re- 
ception, stood the British ministry, whose policy it 
was to belittle and abuse us. Writers seriously 
affirmed that the seeming travellers were subsidized 
lampooners, out of Grub Street. After the second 
of our wars with the mother country, the criticism 
of America took on an even more serious form. 
Critics of Southey's repute, wits as modish as Sydney 
Smith, all the quarterly reviewers, joined in the hue 
and cry, in order to discourage immigration, said 
some ; as an inexpensive manner of revenge, thought 
others. For ten years waged an inkpot-battle that 
was none the less bitter for being futile ; criticisms 
bred rejoinders, strictures, recriminations. Mean- 
time there was engendered in this country "a hearty 
detestation of Great Britain which strongly affected 
international relations for many years to come." In- 
cidentally, though many "Travels" and "Journeys" 
and "Journals" were inscribed, no worthy contribu- 
tion was made to the literature of travel. 

However, before the kind of works I speak of came 
into fashion a certain number of worthier books were 
written in our honor by foreigners or citizens of alien 
birth. It seems strange that we who make so much 
of foreign travels should make so very little of these 
excellent hors d'oeuvres from our own garden-plot. 
The earlier voyagers high-spirited explorers, or 
Jesuits carrying the cross through an unmapped wil- 
derness make thrilling reading. Then there are 
also the eighteenth-century travellers good com- 
panions, albeit less heroic. True as it is that the 
Vicomte de Chateaubriand almost founded the genre 
of literary travels at least he may certainly be 
given the credit of dignifying it, as Scott dignified 
the novel that supreme rhetorician is not the only 
European who found in his American experiences 
a literary inspiration. It is hardly surprising that 
Lafayette, who proved himself so good a friend of 
the Colonies, was an enthusiastic historian of their 
novelty and simplicity. He wrote home, indeed, of 
their patriotism and delightful equality: "the wor- 
thiest and the poorest were on a level," and, though 
there there were some large fortunes, he discovered 
no distinction in the manners of different classes 
toward each other. Lafayette considered Charleston 
one of the handsomest and best-built cities he had 
ever seen, and its inhabitants the most agreeable 
people ; he found even the inns delightful. But 
Lafayette is only one traveller, and not the most 
illuminating. 

In the last few years, at least, American pub- 
lishers seem to have discovered the attractiveness 
of some of the less known narratives of early 
travel, and we have from their presses several

handsome reprints.* The writers whose fame is 
thus refreshed are, chiefly, CrevecuMir, Latrobe, 
and John Davis. At a somewhat earlier date was 
issued a fragment of Thomas Twining's diary 
recording that honest Englishman's impressions 
of the States in 1796. In Virginia, this observer 
notes, hammer and trowel were everywhere in 
evidence : " a cheering sight, and a remarkable 
contrast with the dilapidation of cities which I had 
seen in my former [t. ., East Indian] travels. 
Although the latter," Twining adds, " were calcu- 
lated to afford a deeper interest in some respects, 
the scene of new and active life, the foundations 
of future prosperity which Alexandria presented, 
made me feel how much more gratifying it is to ob- 
serve the rise of a new state than the decline of an 
old one." Needless to add that the " Alexandria " 
referred to is the Alexandria of Virginia. 

Such was the mood of America's earlier visitors ; 
and their jottings are to be cherished by all good 
Americans. For it was only a great while later that 
the cosmopolitan Philarete Charles wrote : " While 
Europe is breaking up, America is forming herself. 
. . . America waxes great; Europe wanes away." 
Charles's antithesis was only for the future ; and it 
is, meanwhile, a pleasant coincidence that Twining's 
remarks on Alexandria are pretty closely parallelled 
by the Franco-American Farmer, St. John de Creve- 
coeur. He declares : 

" We are all apt to love and admire exotica, even though 
they may be inferior to our own possessions. And that is 
the reason, I imagine, why so many persons are continually 
going to visit Italy. . . . Methinks there would be much 
more solid satisfaction in observing among us, the humble 
rudiments and embryos of societies spreading every where, 
the recent foundation of our towns, and the settlement of so 
many rural districts. I am sure that the rapidity of their 
growth would be more pleasing to behold, than the ruins of 
old towers, useless acqueducts, or impending battlements." 

If the general category of books written by early 
travellers in America has thus far wanted popularity, 
perhaps one reason has been the old bitterness engen- 
dered by a very different class of visitors. Twining 
and Cre vecoeur were eclipsed, alas ! by their virulent 
successors. Now, however, the time is ripe for us to 
learn, first, that not all our visitors, even at this stage, 
were Englishmen ; second, that of the English, not 
all, by any means, were cads. The authors named 
should come into their own, for Captain Hall and

the unspeakable (albeit vivacious) Mrs.Trollope were 
long since banishi-d from the bookshelf. Let us forget 
their very existence in making the acquaintance of 
John Davis, poet and novelist, peripatetic tutor and 
indefatigable journalist 

II. 

Davis's book, if its taste is not always irreproach- 
able, is one of the most imaginative devoted to our 
then unlettered land. From it we learn, besides some- 
thing of Brockden Brown, "Father of the American 
Novel," and of the "American Addison," Joseph 
Dennie, editor of "The Portfolio," much of the 
writer's personality. And that is well ; for to know 
the traveller as well as the travels is one of the great 
desiderata in this kind of writing. One is sure that 
this John Davis was a fetching compound of >mii- 
mentalism and self-confidence, with the latter 
quality reinforced by a strongly practical sense that 
always carried the day. 

He was a Salisbury lad, we know, and, in his own 
words, "reared in the lap of opulence." Also, he 
ran away from home to become a sailor. One may 
rest assured that, in character as in experience, he 
was not like most of his conservative compatriots. 
In the first place, he travelled through these States 
of ours by horse and sloop and on foot : and I am 
always prejudiced, as a fellow-pedestrian, in favor 
of any traveller proceeding under his own power. 
Born vagabond that he was, Davis was something 
of a book-worm, too. He writes : 

" When the boatswain's mate piped Starbowlines, I walked 
up the main rigging into the top. I always put Le Sage in 
ray pocket; and in the maintop of an East Indiaroan, under a 
cloudless tropical sky, when the breeze waa so steady that for 
days we had no occasion to start either tack or sheet, I began to 
cultivate the language of the Court of Lewis the Fourteenth." 

It was in 1798 that he embarked at Bristol for the 
United States ; in other words, he was twenty-two. 
He modestly confesses : 

" I had before made some progress in Greek, and began 
the study of the language of harmony, with the Father of 
Poetry, and the Bible of the Ancients. In Latin, I had 
looked into every writer of the Julian and Augustan ages; 
the study of French has always been to me like the cracking 
of nuts ; and in my vernacular idiom, I had neglected no 
author from Bnnyan to Bolingbroke." 

Thus he was, if we may take his word for it, a finished 
linguist. We read, indeed, all in one sentence, that he 
"translated at New York Bonaparte's 'Campaign in 
Italy,' a considerable octavo, and proceeded to the 
South." At one juncture, he reproduces in his book of 
travels a considerable "French Essay" of his own 
composition : accounting for his proficiency \>\ the fact 
that he was never in France. " I therefore enjoy a 
particular advantage," he explains ; " for my style, 
formed only upon writers, can be infected with no col- 
loquial barbarisms." There spoke an Englishman ! 
If his humor is sometimes delightfully uncon- 
scious, Davis is not wanting in calculated humor 
scarcely less refreshing. Both his humor and his 
amazing modernity of temper declare themselves in 
the preface to his substantial Travels, where he 
promises us that, in comparing this volume with

those of his precedessors, one " will find himself 
exempt from various persecutions," to wit : 

" (1) I make no mention of my dinner, whether it was fish 
or flesh, boiled or roasted, hot or cold. (2) I never complain 
of my bed. (3) I make no drawings of old castles, old 
churches, old pent-houses, and old walls, which, undeserving 
of repair, have been abandoned by their possessors.'' 

These are negative merits and some of them doubt- 
ful at that. It is more to the point that he delin- 
eates, in high relief, more than one " original " 
now and again an American type, still recognizable ; 
now such a figure as "Mr. George," the conceited 
Irish schoolmaster, his friend ; not to forget the ad- 
mirable De Bow, a physician with more than a touch 
of the charlatan, who might have stepped out from 
a chapter of Smollett or Fielding. He says : 

" I landed at Charleston with Doctor De Bow, who had 
clad himself in his black suit, and though a young man, wore 
a monstrous pair of spectacles on his nose. Adieu jollity! 
adieu laughter ! the Doctor was without an acquaintance on 
a strange shore, and he had no other friend but his solemnity 
to recommend him. ... In a few days he contrived to hire 
part of a house in Union-Street ; obtained credit for a con- 
siderable quantity of drugs ; and only wanted a chariot to 
equal the best Physician in Charleston." 

De Bow avoided Dr. Holmes's error, and it was to 
no purpose that Davis " endeavoured to provoke him 
to laughter." Instead, he got his friend the traveller 
to furnish him with "a few Latin phrases, which 
he dealt out to his hearers with an air of profound 
learning. He generally concluded his speeches with 
Nullius addictus jurare in verba magistri." 

Well might Sir George Trevelyan write in his 
" American Revolution " that these Travels of John 
Davis's make " an exquisitely absurd book, which 
the world, to the dimunition of its gayety, has for- 
gotten ! " 

III. 

The editor of these Travels takes pains to state 
that here is a work unique in its period, being 
written by one who, professedly a man of letters, 
" cared little for the political aspects of what he 
saw, and asked no place among statisticians." (It 
seems to be the editor's chief affair, nowadays, to 
prove his book "unique.") And Mr. Morrison 
goes on to say that " Crevecceur and Chateaubriand 
were sentimentalists " which is true enough ; but 
that Chateaubriand "might have written his book 
in his tower " whatever that means and that 
Crevecoeur " is very disquisitional." Clever oppo- 
sitions, no doubt ; although what has deeply im- 
pressed me about Davis and Chateaubriand is, 
precisely, their common aloofness from mere mat- 
ters of fact ; while both Davis and Crevecceur, 
like Chateaubriand himself, are saturated with 
Rousseau. Davis was, frankly, a reader and ad- 
mirer of " Emile "; as for Crevecceur, he does not 
need to name Rousseau, penetrated as he is by some 
of his theories and all of his sympathies. Creve- 
cceur is, at bottom, a far more Utopian personage 
than either Chateaubriand or Davis ; he delights in 
spinning out little idylls and anecdotes, such as 
Bernardin might have inscribed. Davis, on the 



other hand, writes that " his study was Latin, his 
recreation the Confessions of the eloquent Citizen 
of Geneva." Just as the author of the Memoires 
d' Outre- Tombe lived out, in England, that episode of 
the Nouvelle Heloise, so did Davis, in America, 
indulge himself (he, too, a tutor) in adventures 
mildly h la St.-Preux. He even read the novel of 
Rousseau's disciple Bernardin with one of his fair 
pupils herself a Virginia. If one could accept 
John Davis's writings as strictly documentary, one 
would be almost justified in defending Wilde's 
paradox that Life copies Literature not Litera- 
ture mere Life. But Davis's narrative is itself 
largely "literary." It is, let us say, as imagina- 
tive as Rostand's " Romanesques ": where Percinet 
reads Sylvette " Romeo and Juliet," and where these 
youngsters proceed thereupon to interpret for them- 
selves the beaux vers du grand Will; their fathers 
helped by Straforel complacently performing for 
an act or two the Montagu and Capulet. In Davis, 
one never forgets the novelist in the traveller. 

Crevecoeur's "Letters from an American Farmer," 
like Davis's book, has an unmistakably literary mo- 
tive and flavor. This time, however, the book is not 
merely "literary": it is literature. According to 
Hazlitt, " the power to sympathize with nature, with- 
out thinking of ourselves or others, if it is not a defi- 
nition of genius, comes near to it"; and he wrote 
these lines with Crevecceur in mind as one who pos- 
sessed that magic power. He who thinks the praise 
too great for a writer so unfamiliar is recommended 
to read of a certain battle between two snakes of 
" the dazzling, almost invisible flutter of the hum- 
ming-bird's wing " of the planting of the sassafras 
tree. But " enough of this illustrious obscure," to 
quote Hazlitt once more ; " for it is the rule of criti- 
cism to praise none but the overpraised, and to offer 
fresh incense to the idol of the day." 

Others, at least, have followed that " rule of criti- 
cism ": the American Farmer born a French gen- 
tleman, be it said in passing has long enjoyed an 
undisturbed seclusion. Lamb, to be sure, recom- 
mended his book to friends and correspondents ; the 
dreamers about a Pantisocracy read it ; Lowell called 
it " that dear book." But Dr. Eliot has preferred 
to include Woolman's dull Journal in his recent col- 
lection a book no more informing, certainly, and 
much less graceful in spirit and in phrasing. Though 
here stands a writer who uses the tone of an ideal- 
istic philosopher and the powers of observation of a 
woodsman, there is only this clumsy reprint to remind 
readers of his adventurous life and gentle spirit; to 
remind them, also, how he tangibly expressed the 
Rousseauian ideal. Though we have in St.-John de 
Crevecceur a contemporary a correspondent, even 
of Franklin, yet, while he shared many of Poor 
Richard's enthusiasms, one may travel far without 
finding a more complete antithesis to the common- 
sense philosopher. In a prose age, Crevecceur lived 
a kind of pastoral poetry; in an age largely blind, he 
saw the beauties of nature, not through readings in

the French, bat with his own keen eyes. His powers 
of observation are in marked contract with Chateau- 
briand's generalizing tendency, exhibited in his 
" American Travels " as in all his writings. And t lie 
man's optimism, his grateful personality, his sunVr- 
ings, are all endearments. This poet-naturalist 
might have used Cotton's " Retirement" for a motto 
on his title-page : 

" Farewell, thou busy world, and may 

We never meet again; 
Here I can eat and sleep and pray . . ." 

but that he found time to turn the clods withal, and 
eyes to watch the earth blackening behind the plough. 
" Our necessities," wrote Poe (who contended, in 
a half-hearted manner, that Americans were as poet- 
ical a people as any other), " have been mistaken 
for our propensities. Having been forced to make 
railroads, it has been deemed impossible that we 
should make verse." But here was St.-John de 
Crevecoeur writing, in the eighteenth century, his 
idyllic Letters ; while, if he did not build railroads, 
he interested himself in the experiments of Fitch and 
Rumsey and Parmentier, and he organized a packet- 
line between New York and a French port. Creve- 
coeur should have appealed to the American imagina- 
tion from the first, combining as he did the faculty of 
the ideal and the achievement of the actual. 

IV. 

" A letter is only conversation in black and white," 
he writes. Our Farmer emphasizes his plainness, 
and promises only a matter-of-fact account of his 
pursuits. Yet he has his full share of eighteenth 
century " sensibility." Since he is, however, at many 
removes from the sophistications of London and 
Paris, he is stirred, not by the fond behavior of a lap- 
dog (like Mackenzie), or "the little arrangement" 
a carter makes with the bridle of his departed ass 
(driven to death, likely enough ; see the "Sentimen- 
tal Journey "), but by such matters as he finds at 
home. " When I contemplate my wife, by my fire- 
side, while she either spins, knits, darns, or suckles 
our child, I cannot describe the various emotions of 
love, of gratitude, of conscious pride which thrill in 
my heart and often overflow in voluntary tears." 
He never returns home "without feeling some pleas- 
ant emotion," often suppressed "as useless and fool- 
ish." He has his reveries, too but they are pure 
and generous ; their subject is the future of his child- 
ren. One is reminded of a page in Twining's diary, 
already cited ; writing of the farms that he passed 
in travelling from Philadelphia to Baltimore, and 
the farmhouses " formed of bars or logs of wood, 
covered with laths and plaster," the situation of their 
proprietors seems to him little enviable; but com- 
pensated by the fact that " every first settler in a 
new country labors less for the present than for the 
future, for himself than for his posterity, and it is 
this honorable consciousness that invigorates his toil, 
cheers his solitude, and alleviates his privations." 
Here Twining renders, as Hazlitt justly says Creve- 
cceur succeeds in doing, in his vividly characteristic 



manner, " not only the objects, but the feelings, of 
a new country." Nor is that all. 

For Creveoceur at least is, when all is said and 
done, the eighteenth-century Thoreau : a Thoreau 
more urbane (if urbanity is at all compatible with 
the thought of that naturalist) a French-Amer- 
ican Thoreau. Other journalists of the eighteenth 
century were gifted a* naturalist ^ : this even among 
the American travellers. The architect Latrobe, for 
example, was more highly gifted in this respect than 
was good Crevecceur. He aptly enough describes 
(Petersburg, June 17, 1796) how a Mr. Anderson, 
with what he considered " a most desperate intrepid- 
ity, stripped himself, and, furnished only with a pipe 
of tobacco, knocked off the head of two beehives and 
robbed them of their contents without being once 
stung by the thousand bees that were buzzing about 
him." But Crevecoaur describes how, in midwinter, 
instead of trapping and " murthering " the quail. 
" often in the angles of fences where the motion of 
the wind prevents the snow from settling, I carry 
them both chaff and grain : the one to feed them, 
the other to prevent their tender feet from freezing 
fast to the earth, as I have frequently observed 
them to do." This is an indication of his love for 
the birds of field and forest ; he was no less observ- 
ing than affectionate. A German traveller wrote 
that " in the thrush kind America is poor ; there is 
only the red-breasted robin. . . . Very few birds nest 
in the woods ; a solemn stillness prevails through 
them, interrupted only by the screaming of the 
crows." It is well to set beside this passage Creve- 
cceur's statement that in the spring he generally 
rose from bed "about the indistinct interval, which, 
properly speaking, is neither night nor day," to 
enjoy " the universal vocal choir." He continues 
(more and more lyrically): 

" Who can listen unmoved to the sweet love-tales of our 
robins, told from tree to tree ? or to the shrill cat birds ? 
The sublime accents of the thrush from on high, always re- 
tard ray steps, that I may listen to the delicious music." 

And the Farmer is no less interested in " the aston- 
ishing art which all birds display in the construction 
of their nests, ill provided as we may suppose them 
with proper tools." At one time during his long 
American residence, he gathered the materials for 
an unpublished study of ant-life ; and his bees were 
ever a great interest for him : " their government, 
their industry, their quarrels, their passions." In 
hours of rest he was most often to be found, he tells 
us, under the locust tree where his bee-hive stood. 
" By their movements," he wrote, " I can predict the 
weather, and can tell the day of their swarming." 
When other men go hunting game, he goes bee- 
hunting. Such are the matters he tells of in his 
Letters. And he gains in comparison with Latrobe 
that other naturalist so long as our principal ob-

full of inner as well as superficial meaning. He 
took more pleasure in hunting bees than in expedi- 
tions with his dog and gun ; the king-birds destroy 
his bees ; but, he adds, they drive the crows away. 
To this extent does he anticipate Emerson's doctrine 
of compensations. As for the king-birds, he ordi- 
narily could not persuade himself to shoot them. 
On one occasion, when he fired at a more than 
commonly impertinent specimen, " and immediately 
opened his maw," he took from it 175 bees. 

" I laid them all on a blanket in the sun, and to ray great 
surprise 54 returned to life, licked themselves clean, and joy- 
fully went back to the hive ; where they probably informed 
their companions of such an adventure and escape as I be- 
lieve had never happened before to American bees." 
Must one regard this as a fable? It is by no means 
so remarkable a yarn as one may find told by other 
naturalists of the same century. There is, for ex- 
ample, that undated letter of John Bartram's in which 
he makes inquiries of his brother William concerning 
" Ye Wonderful Flower "; there is, too, Kalm's re- 
port of Bartram's bear: 

" When a bear catches a bear, he kills her in the following 
manner: he bites a hole into the hide & blows with all his 
power into it, till the animal swells excessively & dies ; for 
the air expands greatly between flesh and the hide." 

After fancies like these, where is the improbability 
of Crevecoeur's modest adaptation of the Jonah 
allegory, that he refreshes in applying to the king- 
bird and the bees ? The episode suggests, for that 
matter, a chapter in Ik Marvel's " Farm at Edge- 
wood." That later " American Farmer " describes 
the same birds, the same bees ; he has, too, the same 
supremely gentle spirit. " I have not the heart to 
shoot the king-birds, nor do I enter very actively 
into the battles of the bees," he confesses. " I give 
them fair play, good lodging, limitless flowers, wil- 
lows bending (as Virgil advises) into the quiet waters 
of a near pool." Crevecoeur himself might have 
written thus ; it is the essential modernity of the 
earlier writer that most impresses one, after the 
quiet charm of his pictures. 

Yet his was the age of William Livingston later 
governor of New Jersey. In the very year when 
a London publisher issued the first edition of the 
Farmer's Letters, Livingston (described on his title- 
page as a "young gentleman educated at Yale Col- 
lege ") brought out his " Philosophic Solitude," at 
Trenton, in his native State. It is worth our while 
to quote " Philosophic Solitude ": for " one cannot 
write in white chalk except on a blackboard," and 
here is offered the chance to compare Crevecoeur's 
prose with contemporary verse : 

" Let ardent heroes seek renown in arms, 

Pant after fame, and rush to war's alarms, . . . 

Mine be the pleasures of a rural life." 

The thought is one phrased with much directness 
by Crevecoeur. But let us quote the lines that fol- 
low the exordium : 

" Me to sequestred scenes, ye muses guide, 

Where nature wantons in her virgin-pride ; 

To mossy banks edg'd round with op'ning flow'rs, 

Elysian fields, and araaranthin bow 'rs . . . 

Welcome ye shades ! all hail, ye vernal blooms ! 



Ye bow 'ry thickets, and prophetic glooms ! 
Ye forests hail ! ye solitary woods, " 

but since the "young gentleman educated at Yale 
College " is on the verge of rhyming " woods " and 
" floods," it is more kind to leave him here. He 
has been quoted, not to qualify for a place on 
Dr. Crothers's " Bookshelf of the Hundred Worst 
Books," but as a poet of his time and place. He 
had a fine eye for nature seen through library 
windows. He echoed a whole line of British 
poets most of them second-rate poets ; echoed 
them atrociously. It is precisely because one 
finds no such " echoes " in Creveco3ur that one may 
praise his spontaneity and vigor. He did not im- 
port nightingales into his America, as some of his 
contemporaries among the poets did. He blazed 
the way, rather, toward our present-day appreciation 
of surrounding nature which was not banal then. 
It is the youthfulness of these Letters, after their 
century and a third of dust-gathering, that is least 
likely to escape us. They are, in their joy of living 
in a new land in the future, as it were fresher 
even than are Davis's Travels in their irrepressible 
humor. They " smell of the woods," as their author 
himself did not fail to observe. 

V. 

For the collector of mere facts, Crevecoaur's work 
is of scarcely more consequence than Davis's and 
Davis was a born romancer. Neither of these writers 
compares in " documentary " worth with Latrobe 
or Twining curt as the latter is. For that reason 
I say nothing of these men's attacks upon slavery. 
I do not even discuss Crevecosur's idealistic account 
of Nantucket, " with the manners, customs, policy, 
and trade of the Inhabitants." These chapters in their 
works are, after all, less instructive than Twining's 
charitable notes upon American inns and roads and 
bridges, or Latrobe's upon New Orleans, the con 
struction of the Capitol at Washington (which he 
completed), and so on. All these are matters for 
the historian. Is there not room on our reading- 
table for the more imaginative narrative of Davis 
the more " exalted " book of the Cultivateur ? 

Early American literature is not so rich that we 
can afford to miss Crevecoaur's chief performance, 
any more than Franklin's Autobiography. These 
are almost the only interesting books written in our 
land during the eighteenth century, and deserve 
good treatment. Nor is the literature of American 
travel rich enough to justify the neglect of the sev- 
eral nomads whom I have named notably John 
Davis. Fortunately for the reader who means to go 
further in this matter, I have not presented here more 
than a few chance crumbs from the table that stands 
ready spread. Latrobe, architect and naturalist; 
Crevecceur, farmer-philosopher ; Davis, man of let- 
ters ; Twining, East India bureaucrat : even in the 
list of their varied names and trades there is a 
piquancy not often suggested by the backs of books. 
Their content is ten times better yet!

CASUAL COMMENT. 



A NOTABLE TRIUMVIRATE OF DI8TIN< .1 I-ll 1 I 

AMERICANS is that which includes the names of 
John Higelow (who has just left us), Benjamin 
Franklin, and Samuel J. Tilden. Both of the latter 
men were objects of Mr. Bigelow's especial admira- 
tion, and to both he rendered invaluable services in 
writing their lives and editing their works. With- 
out question his most valuable contribution to litera- 
ture is his masterly achievement in biography, or 
rather in autobiography, "The Life of Benjamin 
Franklin Written by Himself." This triumph of 
editorial skill was the natural fruit of Mr. Bigelow's 
term as consul and afterward minister at Paris, 
where the trial of his distinguished predecessor in 
diplomacy seems from the first to have lured him to 
those studies of Franklin that continued thereafter 
one of his chief interests. It was his discovery in 
Paris of the original manuscript of Franklin's auto- 
biography that mainly prompted the literary labors 
which were given to the world in 1874 in those 
three familiar volumes of the " Life of Franklin." 
Unpublished manuscripts, letters, printed corres- 
pondence, in fact all available sources of information, 
were made tributary to this authoritative account of 
one with whom the editor found himself so largely 
in sympathy, and some of whose distinguishing traits 
he himself has been said to possess. A certain genial 
largeness of nature belonged to both; both were 
philosophers, and both were humorists in their way, 
with insight into human nature and a power of apt 
and striking oral and written expression. Eminent 
public service, too, must be credited to both, and the 
active life of each was of unusual length and useful- 
ness, though the eighty-four years of Franklin were 
exceeded by ten in Mr. Bigelow's record of longevity. 
The Paris studies which produced so noteworthy 
results in making the world better acquainted with 
Franklin led also to the editing of the latter's com- 
plete works in ten volumes the now recognized 
standard edition of those works. Hardly second to 
the admiring tribute rendered by Mr. Bigelow to 
Franklin the statesman of the past, was his whole- 
souled devotion to Samuel J. Tilden, his friend and 
contemporary in public life, whose biography he 
wrote and whose speeches and other writings he 
edited. But a still greater service was rendered to 
the cause of letters when Tilden's literary executor 
undertook also the duties of trustee of his estate, and 
thus became instrumental in establishing the New 
York Public Library on its triple foundation, Astor, 
Lenox, and Tilden. Elected the first president of 
this library board, he held that high office until his 
death. . . . 

THE OUTLOOK FOR POKTRY IN AMERICA appears 
to Mr. William Stanley Braithwaite, in his seventh 
annual survey of magazine verse, encouragingly 
good. Writing in the Boston "Transcript," he says : 
"That poetry is swinging back, not only artistically 
and ideally, but commercially, is indicated, and it 



ix a good sign, by the experience of one New York 
publisher at le:i-t, who has issued a great many l>ooks 
of poetry, not one of which was at the author's ex- 
pense, and all of which have been successful com- 
mercially." Other signs in plenty .Mr. Braithwaite 
finds to confirm his belief that poetry is looking up, 
and that better times for the poets lie ahead. He 
cites the publication of numerous noteworthy articles 
on poetry and poets in the year's magazines, besides 
giving the result of his examination <>f the poems 
appearing in six prominent periodicals of the same 
period. Also, " the Poetry Society of America has 
weathered through a useful first year of its existence, 
and is now planning for a second year of practical 
endeavor in throwing its influence and labors towards 
the circulation of poetry among the people through- 
out the country." A cheering indication of popular 
interest in poetry not noted by Mr. Braithwaite is 
the increasingly frequent inquiry, in the notes and 
queries " department of many papers, as to the author- 
ship of favorite old poems, the reprinting of which is 
also often requested. 

WHAT THEY ARE READING IN ATHENS in these 
very post-classical days seems to be partly indicated 
by an advertisement just now making itself conspic- 
uous in the Greek capital, calling attention to a new 
series of translations from the ancient authors. A 
complete set of these modern Greek versions of the 
Greek classics may be had for the remarkably mod- 
erate sum of one hundred and twenty drachme, or 
somewhat less than twenty- four dollars of our money. 
Doubtless the volumes will not compare in elaborate- 
ness of detail with the prospective Loeb set of an- 
cient classics, but it may be that they will be more 
read by the people. A correspondent writes of 
noting a young mechanical engineer reading the 
" CEdipus at Colonus " in a street-car even under 
the discomfort of strap-hanging with one hand while 
he held his book with the other. 



OBSERVATIONS OF AN UNREFORMEO SI-KLI.KR 
catch our eye in an open letter to the New York 
" Evening Post " from Mr. Albert J. R. Schumaker, 
who, apparently in facetious allusion to a recent 
leaflet from No. 1 Madison Avenue, gives his ad- 
dress as " Upland Lawn, Pa.," whither he had pre- 
sumably gone to " observe how gently the sunlight 
[of reformed spelling] comes in the place of the re- 
ceding darkness" of conventional orthography. This 
correspondent suggests that perhaps the present de- 
plored discrepancy between English spelling and 
English pronunciation may be as much the fault of 
the latter as of the former, and he asks, "Why may 
it not best be removed by modifying that element 
which admittedly is least resistant to change ': This 
uniformity in pronunciation, he holds, " is for many 
reasons a primary desideratum, and, when attained, 
little will be heard about phonetic spelling." Any- 
thing like fixity, however, either in pronunciation 
or in spelling, is not to be expected in a living Ian-

guage, though we might well give heed to Mr. Henry 
James's admonition of a few years ago and pay 
greater attention to orthoepy. Just at present it may 
afford entertainment to quote a news paragraph of 
the day : " In North Carolina an enraged citizen 
shot a neighbor through the breast, inflicting a wound 
which resulted in the latter's death and his own ar- 
rest for murder. A short time later, however, he 
was released from custody. In the indictment, the 
clerk had spelled breast as ' b-r-e-s-t.' The court 
held that the misspelled indictment was not legal, 
and freed the prisoner " there being no such part 
as " brest " known to human anatomy. Probably a 
shot in the " hed " or " nek " would likewise have 
fallen outside judicial cognizance in this ortho- 
graphically unreformed court. A pathetic New 
Year's card now before us exhorts to " let every 
noble thot have expression " ; an appeal likely to 
come with lessened force to those who were not 
"cot" young enough to be "tot" to profit by or 
to be " wrot " upon by counsels couched in that 
peculiar form. ... 

CULTURE FOB A WHOLE COMMONWEALTH, and 
that commonwealth Minnesota, is the ideal cherished 
by the new head of the State University at Minne- 
apolis. " I want to see the entire University merged 
into one great extension department," says Dr. Vin- 
cent, " to teach the principles of agriculture, engi- 
neering, political science, economics, history, and 
languages. . . . Why should we not take our Uni- 
versity into the country districts and maintain a 
Chautauqua at various points in the State? We 
could call them university weeks. . . . We could 
have an extension circuit 'of six towns in one com- 
munity and travel between them in motor cars. . . . 
These lectures could be given in the day. In the 
evening we could give our dramatic clubs, our glee 
clubs and orchestra to supply the music, and give 
Shakespearian plays. We would take demonstration 
tents, as is the custom at the county fairs, to show 
various agricultural and industrial exhibits. We 
would take with us a model house its rooms fur- 
nished by home economic experts. With this there 
would be demonstrations in cooking." Truly, the 
educational world moves. There was a time, within 
the memory of men still living, when the most promis- 
ing son of a well-ordered family was sent, with 
prayers and tears and hopes, to the college of his 
father and grandfather, to fit himself for a learned 
profession, while those at home watched his progress 
in breathless interest. Now it is proposed that the 
university shall come to the whole family, and to 
every family, and turn the whole commonwealth 
into an aristocracy of culture or should we say a 
democracy of culture ? ... 

MRS. KATE GANNETT WELLS, great-granddaughter 
of President Ezra Stiles of Yale, and daughter of the 
Rev. Ezra Stiles Gannett, D.D. (long minister of 
the Arlington Street Church in Boston, where he 
succeeded William Ellery Channing), died suddenly, 
at the age of seventy-three, at her Boston home 



on the thirteenth of December. Though known in 
periodical and book literature as Kate Gannett 
Wells (author of " In the Clearings," " Miss Curtis," 
"Two Modern Women," "Little Dick's Son," and 
a collection of essays entitled "About People"), the 
full name of this veteran worker in many worthy 
causes, educational and religious, was Catherine 
Boott Gannett Wells. In 1863 she married Samuel 
Wells, a prominent Boston lawyer whose name is 
associated with many scientific and philanthropic 
societies, but her own work in the world was carried 
on with the vigor and independence of one unfet- 
tered by matrimonial ties. For almost a quarter of 
a century she served on the State Board of Educa- 
tion, interesting herself especially in art education, 
and being instrumental in starting the Massachusetts 
Normal Art School. Her pen was a busy one amid 
her other activities ; and she wrote especially on 
subjects connected with those activities, though, as 
her list of books shows, she was not unendowed with 
creative imagination. A familiar figure on the 
platform and a leader in numerous good causes, she 
leaves many to lament her death. 



A FRENCH TRIBUTE TO DICKENS, at this time 
when all the English-speaking world is preparing to 
celebrate his centennial, has a certain special signifi- 
cance. A new dramatization, or stage adaptation, 
of "David Copperfield," from the hand of M. Max 
Maurey, has been playing at the Ode'on in Paris, 
and has met with popular favor even without having 
to resort to the familiar French device of caricaturing 
John Bull. The play, while taking certain liberties 
with the letter of its original, seems to have caught a 
good deal of the spirit of Dickens even in its foreign 
dress. It produced a Micawber, at any rate, that 
gave great satisfaction though whether Dickens 
himself would have recognized him maybe somewhat 
doubtful. At the same time with this more ambitious 
undertaking at the Ode'on there has been given at a 
humbler playhouse a moving-picture representation 
of various comical scenes from " Pickwick," which 
one may safely infer to have vastly delighted the 
groundlings. There is no denying the universality 
and the immortality of Dickens's human appeal. 



THE RATING OP FIRST EDITIONS OF "R. L. S." 

has notably risen since the time when Mr. Charles 
Harrison, a London publisher who now retires after 
fourteen years of service with Messrs. Kegan Paul 
& Co., and twenty-one with Messrs. Newnes, disposed 
of some of Stevenson's early works as "remainders " 
his " Virginibus Puerisque," " Travels with a 
Donkey," and " An Inland Voyage " going for ten 
pence apiece in the original editions that to-day 
command five and six pounds each. What form of 
investment, if one but had the requisite foresight in 
book values, could be more profitable than the pur- 
chase of about-to-be-valuable first editions of current 
works ? But we have to admit, after the manner of 
Duncan, there's no art to find the book's ultimate 
commercial value in its contents.

i HE LEGACY OF WILLIAM JAMKS.* 

Two volumes by William James have ap- 
peared since the remarkable man who bore the 
name has passed away. "Some Problems <>f 
Philosophy " is printed from an unfinished 
manuscript as "a beginning of an introduction 
to philosophy," and is addressed to the student 
and the general reader the latter in respect to 
the writings of James neither an inconsiderable 
nor a perfunctory public. " Memories and Stu 
dies " collects the addresses, essays, and occa- 
sional papers of recent years, for the most part 
addressed to a larger circle responsive to the 
vigor of his thought, the charm of his words. 
Together they constitute a legacy valuable in its 
own right, enhanced in value by a sense of mo- 
mentous loss. Professor Royce places William 
James along with Jonathan Edwards and Ralph 
Waldo Emerson as the three, " and only three," 
representative American philosophers, and ac- 
cords to James "a more extended range of present 
influence than Emerson has ever possessed." The 
Americanism of James combined a pioneering 
freshness of view, a command of self-made power, 
with a democratic sympathy of insight that won 
the respect of foreign scholarship of whatever 
persuasion, and gained him a loyal following at 
home. And yet he sowed and reaped in pastures 
old which he made to appear new with the promise 
of an added richness of harvest. W r hatever the 
final value of his constructive contributions may 
prove to be, his reconstruction of problems to 
meet the needs and guide the interests of his 
generation give him the place of a distinguished 
leader of the thoughts of thoughtful men. 

James the philosopher and James the human- 
ist appear effectively in the present volumes ; and 
there is nothing more characteristically Jamesian 
than the determination and the power to make 
philosophy human, to divest it of " dry dogmatic 
ways." No teacher of philosophy can spend the 
first hour of his course more profitably than by 
reading to his students the opening chapter of 
the " Problems," entitled " Philosophy and its 
Critics ": " At a technical school a man may 
grow into a first-rate instrument for doing a cer- 
tain job, and he may miss all the graciousness 
of mind suggested by the term liberal culture."

The mind of philosophy " is full of air that plays 
round every subject." It rouses from " native 
dogmatic slumber," and breaks up caked prej- 
udices." It has always been "a sort of feeun- 
dation of four different human interests, science, 
poetry, religion, andlo^ic, I. y one another." "A 
man with no philosophy in him is the most inau- 
spicious and unprofitable of all possible social 
mates." The questioning of the value of the dis- 
cipline is familiar; it twits the philosopher with 
being like a "blind man in a dark room looking 
for a black cat that is not there." Though per- 
tinent as a warning, the taunt is beside the mark 
as a criticism ; for the problems are insistent, 
and leave the alternative of a shallow satisfaction 
or a deeper one. " Philosophy in the full sense 
is only man thinking," and projects and reflects 
the nature and history of humanity as does no 
other occupation. It has its dramatic aspects, 
and makes the step from the primitive medicine- 
man working a charm upon the hair of an enemy, 
to the spirit and equipment of the modern labor- 
atory, a triumph of sound thinking sustained by 
insight nurtured in philosophy. The modern 
world is even more a way of thinking than a way 
of living. The real issue has come to divide men 
according as they hold the cumulative philosophic 
impulse of the past to be adequate for immediate 
and future needs, or hold the fresh philosophic 
interpretation to be an indispensable support of 
intellectual progress. Among the philosophers, 
the equally significant choice extends to the treat- 
ment of the problems that are held to be decisive 
and vital ; and if we follow James, in this domain 
temperament as well as logical perspective asserts 
itself, and there emerges the classic academic 
rationalist striving for a closed system with ab- 
stract thought enthroned and its mandates re- 
alized in the world conceptually conceived, or 
the romantic empiricist emphasizing the vastness 
and richness of perceptual experience, and build- 
ing of it and upon it a clue map of the mind's 
domain. 

As the " beginning of an introduction to phil- 
osophy," this overture may suffice to suggest 
the approach to the theme and the treatment 
of its problems. The problem of " the percept 
and the concept," together with the resulting 
>roblem of the "one and the many " as the pat- 
rn of the world's reality, prone as it is to in- 
vite dialectic subtlety and a confusion of solids 
with shadows, is far more than a teething-ring 
'or students or a sophistic puzzle for raaturer 
wits. Its solution, however provisional, sets the 
-rend of the pursuit, determines the position from 
which the world will be posed. For James, tin-

solvent application is the pragmatic criterion 
the test of all our perplex considerations as 
meaning and functional workability ; and in his 
architectural scheme, which incomplete " is too 
much like an arch built only on one side," it is 
this feature that shapes the design, the spring, 
and the form of the arch. Hardly secondary to 
these problems is the problem of novelty, the 
issue of determinism, the struggle for a rational 
view of causation. World-old questions these, 
but yet differently significant to the modern situ- 
ation rendered in a revised version ; fortunate the 
age whose students may take their excursion into 
these fields, personally conducted by the quality 
of leadership possessed by William James. 

Among the notable qualities of James's writ- 
ings was his ability to state the other side of 
the case. He never set up men of straw ; con- 
troversy was a means of clarification. He had 
large intellectual sympathies, and free ones, un- 
restrained by convention. It is natural to find 
him an adept in psychological portraiture. In 
this there is a touch of the Rembrandtesque, re- 
vealing in a pragmatic way not a faithful assem- 
blage of features, but in a contrasted flash of 
high light and deep background what the man 
or the occasion meant. As is true of Rembrandt, 
the acknowledged great and the significant in 
humbler types of humanity received like treat- 
ment at his hands. In the " Memories and 
Studies," along with studies of Emerson and 
Agassiz and Spencer, appear names which, like 
the more obscure of Rembrandt's sitters, will 
carry a vivid impression to later generations, be- 
cause they were set down in the pen -strokes of 
James. James summed up the purpose of a col- 
lege education as that of helping you " to know 
a good man when you see him." He practiced 
what he preached ; but of those who might fol- 
low him modestly in detection of significance, 
few could hope to share his remarkable gift of 
rendering, which was not a trick of technique 
but a quality of inner enlightenment a con- 
tradictory esoteric revelation, in that once 
articulate it seemed familiar, intelligible, and 
commendable. 

This emphasis of significance was deliberate. 
In speaking of Emerson, he called him " a fas- 
tidious lover of significance and distinction," 
whose optimism was not "an indiscriminate hur- 
rahing for the universe." In no less loyal a 
vein he speaks of his friend Francis Boot, a 
character healthy and definite, and true to itself. 
" When a carpenter has a surface to measure, 
he slides his rule along it, and over all its pecul- 
iarities. I sometimes think of Boot as such a 



standard rule against which the changing fash- 
ions of humanity of the last century might come 
to measurement." The mood is at its happiest 
in doing honor to the memory of " a knight- 
errant of the intellectual life," "a leveller 
upward of men ' ' Thomas Davidson. It is pre- 
sumably of Davidson that he is thinking when 
he deplores the blighting conventionality of the 
academic life, and reminds the men of Harvard 
that " our undisciplinables are our proudest pro- 
duct." " The memory of Davidson will always 
strengthen my faith in personal freedom and its 
spontaneities, and make me less unqualifiedly 
respectful than ever of ' Civilization ' with its 
herding and branding, licensing and degree- 
giving, authorizing and appointing, and in gen- 
eral regulating and administering by system the 
lives of human beings." " The best common- 
wealth will always be the one that most cherishes 
the men who represent the residual interests, the 
one that leaves the largest scope to their pecul- 
iarities." It is this romantic admiration of the 
romantic that gave the zest to the sincere ad- 
miration for the work of Frederic Myers in the 
obscure mazes of " psychical research." The 
classic-academic psychologist insists on neatly 
assembled facts, which he can safely " tuck in " 
under his system ; he disports himself on " a 
sun-lit terrace," and declines an excursion into 
the shrubbery beyond. It is when " the nobler 
simplicities " pale, that the jungle invites. Even 
the critics, he contends, those who find the 
thought of Myers extravagant and his lead false, 
no less than the subject of their criticism, "obey 
the dramatic possibilities " of their tempera- 
ment, express their personal equation in terms 
of " the will to believe." In the didactic vein 
rarer in James the thesis becomes a plea for 
the recognition of superiority, as the sense for 
superiority should be the hall-mark of the cul- 
tivated college-bred. If that fails, all is failure. 
" To have spent one's youth at college, in con- 
tact with the choice and rare and precious, and 
yet still to be a blind prig or vulgarian, unable 
to scent out human excellence or to divine it 
amid its accidents, to know it only when ticketed 
and labelled and forced on us by others, this 
indeed should be accounted the very calamity 
and shipwreck of a higher education." The col- 
lege will come to its own only when the college 
tone will have "the highest spreading power"; 
its mission, so inadequately served, is to raise 
the tone of democracy. By this test of the quality 
which it furthers and cherishes will democracy 
be judged. The wealth of nations consists " in 
the number of superior men that it harbors."

** Where quality is the thing sought after, the 
thing of supreme quality is cheap, whatever the 
price one has to pay for it." 

There is no uncertainty in the tone of James's 
protagonism or of his protest. Perhaps to one 
of his temperament, the most trying assignment 
was the handling of an unsympathetic subject. 
He had such in his review of Herbert Spencer, 
which is merciless in its fairness. " Greatness 
and smallness never lived so closely in one skin 
together." " Rarely has Nature performed an 
odder or more Dickens-like feat than when she 
deliberately designed, or accidentally stumbled 
into, the personality of Herbert Spencer." Con- 
sider the reach and spread of his works, his wide 
curiosities, his erudition, his devotion to lofty 
purpose, and we conjure up a " rich and exu- 
berant human being"; what we find is "an old- 
maidish personage, inhabiting boarding-houses, 
equable and lukewarm in all his tastes and pas- 
sions *'; " a stickler for trifles, devoid in youth of 
any wide designs on life "; giving one " a queer 
sense of having no emotional perspective"; in 
contrast to other minds, minds of comparable 
achievement, lacking wholly " a background of 
overflowing mental temptations." Apparently 
he sought a Held where " remorseless explicit- 
ness," " pedantic rectitude," the treating of the 
smallest thing by abstract law, a " sleuth-hound 
scent for what he was after," "untiring pertinac- 
ity," would all be merits, and by good fortune 
he found it. Despite James's conclusion that 
the " First Principles " is " almost a museum 
of blundering reason," the verdict maintains the 
quality of justice, and the picture of the great- 
ness finds no less convincing delineation than 
that of the smallness of the man. 

A like catholicity pervades James's treatment 
of occasions. He spoke as naturally, as con- 
vincingly, in dedicating the " Shaw Memorial " 
to valiant soldiers as in proclaiming the higher 
obligations of peace. He could characterize 
war as absurd and impossible from its own 
monstrosity," and as " the final banquet of 
life's fireworks." "War is human nature at 
its uttermost. We are here to do our utter- 
most. It is a sacrament. Society would rot 
without the mystical blood payment." But the 
balance of judgment is definite, and the direc- 
tion of effort pragmatic. Demonstrate more 
largely, more prudently, more reasonably, the 
equal bigness of peace. Whether the " moral 
equivalent for war" proposed by James the 
enlistment of young men in the war against 
nature proves itself practicable or not, the 
advocacy of war can no longer ignore the chal- 



lenge of its inevitability. Hut James was not a 
publicist, though interested in large causes pre- 
senting issues of principle. He was a philoso- 
pher. As Professor Royce observes, it is the 
business of a philosopher to know us better than 
we know ourselves ; and he was able to bring 
that knowledge of us bat'k to us, profitably and 
acceptably. As .lames says of Davidson, so it 
may be said of him, that he taught, but never 
lectured. 

James the humanist and .James the philoso- 
pher are of a nature all compact. To him in 
life and in philosophy the individual was the 
affair of moment ; life was manifold and criss- 
cross ; problems were of like texture and were 
made simple only by divesting them of their 
vital fringes. Organization was a device, an in- 
strument ; the value lay in the organism and its 
expression. What society may do for life, the 
philosophic ordering of thought may accomplish 
for the mental striving. " Surely the individ- 
ual, the person in the singular number, is the 
more fundamental phenomenon, and the social 
institution, of whatever grade, is but secondary 
and ministerial." Likewise, abstractions, the 
logical reconstruction of the universe in the 
interests of intelligibility, are " secondary and 
ministerial." And such ministry harks back 
to human needs as alike a source and issue. 
Philosophy has " sought by hard reasoning for 
results emotionally valuable." The humanist 
persists in the philosopher.

The Concordance Society, which was organ- 
ized at Yale University in 1906, and which in 
1908 issued Dr. A. S. Cook's concordance to 
the poems of Thomas Gray, has now to its credit 
a second and much more imposing volume. With 
a concordance to Wordsworth to set by the side 
of those to the Bible, Shakespeare, K yd. Milton, 
Pope, Gray, Burns, and Shelley, and with the 
knowledge that Dr. Fliigel's great Chaucer Dic- 
tionary is going steadily forward, our equipment 
in this kind is beginning to assume quite re- 
spectable proportions. The experience of the 
society has. shown that there is no serious ob- 
stacle to getting concordances made, but the ex- 
pense of printing remains a real deterrent. The 
society is not rich enough to furnish more than 
a portion of the necessary guarantee ; and the

present volume owes its publication in part to 
the generosity of the mother and brothers of the 
editor. Cannot some patron of learning be 
found who will at one stroke make it possible 
to round out our collection with concordances, 
let us say, to Spenser, Bacon, Jonson, Dryden, 
Browning, and Tennyson ? 

This latest addition is an ample quarto of 1136 
double-column pages, a hundred lines to the 
column, comprising about 211,000 quotations. 
It is pleasingly printed, and very similar in gen- 
eral appearance to the Bartlett Concordance to 
Shakespeare. It differs somewhat from the lib- 
eral plan of the latter in quoting, not rhetoric- 
ally complete clauses, but simply the line of verse 
in which each word occurs. The result is some- 
times unsatisfactory ; but when one considers 
the initial ease of mechanically excerpting such 
lines for the printer, making transcription unnec- 
essary, and the very great difficulty of abridging 
Wordsworth's involved periods, the plan will 
probably be approved. Moreover, reference to 
the poems themselves is much facilitated by giv- 
ing not only the title and line-number of each, 
but also the page-number of the Oxford Words- 
worth, the basic text. All unlisted and partly 
listed words are entered in their places, duly 
labelled. One is pleased to note, too, a sign of 
scholarly thoroughness in the presence of cross- 
references, as from stone to corner-stone, mile- 
stone^ etc. The absence of these is a serious de- 
fect in the Bartlett Shakespeare Concordance, 
where, for example, one gets no clue from knot- 
ted to curiously -knotted, nor ivova flouting to 
vlouting-stoff . Unfortunately there is a defect 
of another kind in Bartlett that reappears here. 
Homographs are seldom separated. The rose 
that is merely a preterit of rise, and the rose 
that by no other name may smell as sweet, are 
almost inextricably intertwined quite so when 
the line of verse does not positively tell which 
rose it is. One must scan scores of quotations 
to discover whether the poet has ever used keep 
as a noun or brook as a verb. Uncertainty is 
added to vexation when sacred Art is found 
elbowed at intervals by a little copulative verb 
and the whole labelled "partial list." The edi- 
tor pleads that his function is not a lexical one. 
But to have made these obvious distinctions in 
a few homographs of frequent occurrence, as 
Reid did in his concordance to Burns, would 
have been no trespass upon lexicography. In 
some instances there appears to have been an 
undue concern for completeness. Is anything 
gained by citing, from such a poem as " The 
Idiot Boy," every line containing the frequently 



recurring names of Susan Gale and Betty Foy? 
The monotonous iteration of the name of Peter 
Bell occupies fully a column, much to the dis- 
paragement of both Peter the saint and Adam 
Bell the archer. The first personal pronoun 
being made an exception to the general omission 
of pronouns, /, with a " partial list," occupies 
six pages (1200 quotations), while me, my, and 
mine take six more. The reason assigned for 
the inclusion is that these pronouns "are of un- 
usual interest in a subjective poet." On the 
contrary, these inevitable pronouns are in them- 
selves of no interest in a subjective poet of 
no more interest than the name of Peter Bell in 
the poem of " Peter Bell " though in an es- 
sentially narrative or dramatic poet they might 
nave great interest. But this is not a vital mat- 
ter. Apart from the treatment of homographs, 
it is impossible to find serious fault with the vol- 
ume, and Professor Cooper and his collaborators 
deserve the warmest praise. 

Such a compilation naturally invites calcula- 
tions and comparisons. A rough estimate of 
Wordsworth's poetical vocabulary, omitting 
proper names and inflectional forms, shows it 
to comprise upwards of 10,000 words. The fol- 
lowing comparative table, of root-words only, 
may be instructive.

Here, quite apart from differences in bulk of 
writing, is interesting testimony to the compara-

and verb, and the plan of the concordance does 
not enable us to separate the two functions. 
See and sight together yield 1400 : think and 
thought 1000. Of substantives, heart stands 
first, with about 1150 occurrences; man (with 
men) gives about 1100; day, 900; life, 700; 
eye, 700 (there is but one none, and that belongs 
to a hound) ; heaven, 650 ; nature, 600. All 
of which, perhaps, is sufficiently obvious. A 
poet, like other men, is most indebted to his 
eyes, and still more than other men speaks from 
and to the heart. And the most superficial 
acquaintance with Wordsworth suffices to show 
that intense delight in all that meets the eye, 
sympathy with nature, and love in the heart of 
man, are the axes upon which his poetry revolves. 
It is not easy to classify natural objects in the 
order of his interest, but the earth appears to 
come first, with its hills and valleys ; next, the 
sky, with its varying phenomena ; while flowers, 
trees, and birds follow. Perhaps this placing 
before animate nature that which is ordinarily 
regarded as inanimate is not without significance. 
In particular, Wordsworth's eye for the larger 
features of landscape is well attested by some of 
the finest passages in "The Prelude " and " The 
Excursion." Herein he differs considerably 
from Keats and Tennyson, who took delight in 
detail and are rich in " botanical circumstance." 
Tennyson's flora contains 220 names from the 
plant-world (Shakespeare has 150). Words- 
worth cannot have more than half this number. 
For example, while both have barley, bay, beech, 
etc., Tennyson alone has bamboo, bean, black- 
thorn, bluebell, bluebottle, bracken, briony, 
bulrush, burdock. The only plant found in 
Wordsworth from a to d which is not in Tenny- 
son is the buttercup. He has no anemone, no 
clematis, no mistletoe; even the daffodil, so 
memorably associated with his name, occurs but 
three times (in two poems), as against seven 
times in the later poet. There are no rose-leaves, 
no unnietaphorical rose-buds, and but a single 
glimpse of petals. For gleanings of this sort, 
his sister Dorothy's journal affords a much 
richer field. 

Books, we know, held but a secondary place 
in Wordsworth's scheme of human education. 
Yet he read much, and it would be difficult to 
find a more generous tribute to the " consecrated 
works of Bard and Sage " than the benediction 
pronounced upon them in the fifth book of "The 
Prelude." Enshrined in his poems are the 
names of Homer, Plato, Horace, Virgil, Dante, 
Petrarch, Tasso, Camoens, and Cervantes. Ex- 
(*pt Voltaire, there seems to be no French or Ger- 



man name. He was familiar with the doctrines 
of Rousseau, but much further from agreeing 
with them than might be supposed ; with Goethe 
he was quite out of sympathy. He had early 
come to the conviction that he should keep the 
four major English poets continually before him 
as examples, and we find them all mentioned, 
with a frequency in the inverse order of their 
time Milton fifteen, Shakespeare ten, Spenser 
six, Chaucer four times. Hums, whom he placed 
second to Chaucer in " the natural and sensual 
school," is found five times. Pope is not iiim- 
tioned, though Gray, Goldsmith, and Chatterton 
are. His own name occurs twice, and Coleridge's 
three times, but the latter was very often ad- 
dressed simply as " Friend." Scott, Southey, 
Lamb, and Crabbe are also named. Byron, who 
ridiculed him, Shelley, who burlesqued his poetry 
and reproached him for his social apostasy, and 
Keats, who paid him a youthful but sincere tri- 
bute, are passed over in silence. 

Naturally, the vocabulary of one who held a 
pronounced theory of poetic diction is invested 
with exceptional interest. We have come now 
to a better understanding of that theory than 
when we accepted Coleridge's too narrow view 
of it. We know that when Wordsworth con- 
tended for "language really used by men " he 
was only revolting from poetic artificiality, and 
had no intention of descending always to the 
level of rustic speech. That might be done, or 
it might not be done ; only let the language re- 
main the natural expression of the thought be- 
hind it. This view is fully borne out by the 
concordance. From merely glancing through 
it, one gains the general impression that, for the 
particular (undramatic) range of Wordsworth's 
verse, his vocabulary is extremely apt natural. 
rational, broadly eclectic, and satisfying. Ex- 
clusive of specialized activities, and of some 
of the more comic or vulgar aspects of life, he 
covered pretty much the whole human field. 
We are too prone to think of him as exclusively 
the poet of his rustic environment. His youth 
was rich in human experience ; and never, even 
in his retirement, did he cease to survey man- 
kind from China to Peru, or to draw into his 
world of nature the world of books and men. 
On the same pages that glow with hosts of clouds 
or of golden daffodils, are echoes of the tramp- 
ling hosts of the French Revolution. Empires 
and republics, lawyers and judges, arguments 
and appeals, churches, theatres, factories, mer- 
chants, mountebanks, "chattering monkeys 
dangling from their poles, and children whirling 
in their roundabouts," enter with freedom into

the verse. And each of these things is unob- 
trusively designated by its rightful name. The 
language never descends quite as low as Burns's, 
nor rises quite as high as Shelley's ; but it ap- 
proaches both, and its range is greater than that 
of either. We may look in vain for " Auld 
Clootie " and the " whisky gills " and " swag- 
gering blades" that belonged to what Matthew 
Arnold characterized as the " sordid world of 
Scotch drink, Scotch religion, and Scotch man- 
ners." But, what witn horn tobacco-boxes, and 
flannels, and cloaks of duffle grey, we are intro- 
duced into a world as humble, if not as coarse. 
Indeed, we narrowly escape the coarseness. 
" But I will bang your bones ! " says Peter 
Bell to the Ass, in the first edition of that poem 
(compare Burns : " An' I shall bang your hide, 
guidman") ; but the phrase was, however re- 
luctantly, excised, and this concordance is inno- 
cent of it, as it is likewise innocent of that 
ghastly punch-sipping, tea-sipping " party in a 
parlour, Crammed just as they on earth were 
crammed." On the other hand, the full radi- 
ance and resonance of Shelley's vocabulary are 
beyond Wordsworth's reach. This should go 
without saying : shepherded, legioned, hyaline, 
enanguished, rose-ensanguined, star-inwoven, 
whirlwind-peopled, lightning-braided, these 
are native to but one poet in the language. But 
though this diction was not native to Words- 
worth's genius, and though he would never have 
deliberately sought for intrinsically " poetic " 
words, as Rossetti for instance is known to 
have done, he was manifestly neither insen- 
sible nor hostile to them. He would not go out 
of his way for such words as argent, aureate, 
damask, madrigal, nectar, and, as a matter of 
fact, he has none of these ; yet he has words 
of the same class orient, aerial, diadem, 
amaranthine, sylvan together with now and 
then such arresting vocables as diaphanous, 
prelibations, lacrymals, barricadoed. The 
presence of these, in however small numbers, 
proves the point for his eclectic vocabulary, and 
confirms, moreover, his statement that he had 
from a very early age found words " sweet for 
their own sakes, a passion, and a power." 

It is true, the eighteenth century diction still 
lingered with him, contributing some stiffness 
to the general texture. The century itself he 
quite left behind, and one who desires an object- 
lesson need but place the concordances to Pope 
and Wordsworth side by side. Pope's two col- 
umns of " wit " shrink to only a fifth of a column 
in the four times more bulky volume, while his 
single " cottage " is multiplied by a hundred. 



Critics, courtiers, and Cupids almost disappear. 
Doris and Chloe give way to Mary and Lucy. 
Sympathy finds a place among human affections, 
and tranquillity among human blessings. At 
the same time, old traces persist, and not alto- 
gether in the early poems. We still hear much 
of Fancy, and more of Poesy than poetry. The 
air is still sometimes the aether, and the ocean 
the brine. There are occasional ambient streams 
and glassy floods, scaly tribes and feathered 
kinds, and the sportsman's gun has only partly 
displaced the thundering tube. Yet in the main 
this element is negligible, or abundantly com- 
pensated for by such happier reminiscences as 
Spenser's " budded brooms " and Milton's "gad- 
ding vine." More often still, Wordsworth is 
entirely true to himself ; and when the spirit at 
its divinest descends upon him, he is unexcelled 
by any poet in his power to blend words, thought, 
and imagery into one perfect music : 
" A thought is with me sometimes, and I say, 
Should the whole frame of earth by inward throes 
Be wrenched, or fire come down from far to scorch 
Her pleasant habitations, and dry up 
Old Ocean, in his bed left singed and bare, 
Yet would the living Presence still subsist 
Victorious, and composure would ensue, 
And kindlings like the morning presage sure 
Of day returning and of life revived." 

The quotation brings with it a kind of rebuke 
for the triviality of the divagations into which 
we have been led a rebuke that seems to go 
back to the concordance itself, prompting the 
old question, Cui bono ? Was it really worth 
the labor to tear asunder this living tissue, and 
reassemble, in alphabetical unreason, the dead re- 
mains ? "A subterraneous magazine of bones " ! 
With what emotions would Wordsworth himself 
have contemplated these disjecta membra of 
what is perhaps the most indissolubly organic 
body of verse the language possesses? We 
cannot answer. But there is reassurance in the 
thought that the very organic quality of his work 
gives the concordance one of its best excuses for 
being. Now, thanks to the unselfish zeal of the 
compilers, we shall be able to read more clearly 
than heretofore the message which that great and 
"dedicated Spirit" labored so unremittingly to 
leave. ALPHONSO GERALD NEWCOMER.

[Jan. 1, 



I HE AUTHOR OF "CUAM <mi>." 

A little more than a year ago occurred the 
centenary of the author of " Cranford " for 
it is inevitable that as the author of " Cranford " 
Elizabeth Gaskell will be remembered, notwith- 
standing her other substantial contributions to 
literature in the way of novels, tales, and biog- 
raphy. A handsome volume, richly illustrated 
and cleverly planned, comes to us now as one of 
the after-fruits of the anniversary. No formal 
biography of Mrs. Gaskell has ever been pro- 
duced; and although one or two biographies 
have been promised, it is hardly probable that 
such a work will soon appear. It was Mrs. 
Gaskell's earnest wish that her life should not 
be written or her letters published ; and her 
daughters, who were her literary executors, have 
sacredly regarded their mother's wish. But Mrs. 
Chadwick, the author of this very interesting 
book, has utilized material unconsciously sup- 
plied by the novelist herself. 

Mrs. Gaskell, it seems, made constant use of 
facts that, at one time or another, had occurred 
in her own experience, and in portraying the 
characters that figure in her stories she drew 
frequently from real personalities around her. 
Many of her relatives were more or less eccen- 
tric, or, as we say, 4 * original," and the novelist, 
who was a keen observer of persons, delight- 
ing in the discovery of idiosyncracies and 
amusing twists of temperament, reflected these 
quite innocently in her narratives. She was, in 
fact, usually surprised when the similitude was 
pointed out. 

" My mother never meant to put real people 
into her stories," writes one of Mrs. Gaskell's 
daughters, " but even her children would some- 
times recognize the characters and say, ' Oh ! 
So-and-so is just like Mr. Blank/ and she 
would reply, * So he is, but I never meant it for 
him." 

This tendency to reproduce actual facts and 
real personalities in her novels, and also the habit 
of describing under fictitious names the places 
with which she was associated, make her narra- 
tives an interesting field of study in the search 
for further knowledge concerning their author ; 
and this field has been carefully gleaned by Mrs. 
Chadwick. Thus, we are told that in " Cousin 
' Phillis " we have the love-story of Mrs. Gaskell's 
parents; the heroine, in essential features, por- 
traying the mother whom she knew only by an-

other's word. In the novel Mary 1 5m ton." she 
describes the taking of an orphan l>al>e l>y along 
and wearisome stage-coach journey from Loiulm 
to Manchester, which is an incident in her own 
life-story, for, when one year old, she was herself 
thus taken over the same routv. My Lady 
Ludlow " emlxxlies the exjM-riences of her two 
years' residence in the private school at Strat- 
ford, the author figuring in the story as Margaret 
Dawson. Another of Mrs. Gaskell's characters 
may be identified as a port rait of herself, and thU 
is Margaret Hale, in " North and South." The 
character of William Hale in this same novel is 
obviously suggested by her father, William Ste\ 
enson. It has not been generally known that the 
character of Roger Hamley is a portraiture of the 
scientist Charles Darwin, to whom Mrs. Gaskell 
was distantly related. " Cranford," of course, 
is rich in material drawn directly from life. 
Captain Brown, Thomas Holbrook, the Honor- 
able Mrs. Jamieson and Mrs. Fit/ Adam were 
well-known residents in the little community that 
was described under the name of Cranford. Miss 
Jenkyns( Deborah) and Miss Matty were cousins 
of the novelist. The original of Deborah died 
in 1883 (she was born in 1800), and Mi>s Mat- 
ty's prototype survived until 1887, reaching the 
age of eighty-five. The famous sedan chair is 
still in existence, and is used on certain festive 
occasions. Betsy Barker's cow, clad in dark grey 
flannel, lives yet in tradition; and so does the 
cat that swallowed the lace. 

While many of these allusions have long since 
been explained, particularly those that occur in 
"Cranford," many new identifications are here 
presented ; and those who have read and ad- 
mired the works of Mrs. Gaskell will find the 
scant biographical narrative hitherto available 
now amplified and illuminated with characters 
and scenes that add much to its vividness and 
not a little to its details. 

When William Stevenson, the scholarly con- 
tributor to encyclopaedias and reviews, living in 
Chelsea, bereft of his wife, con tern plated the prob- 
lem how best to provide for the care and com- 
fort of an infant daughter hardly a year old, it 
was a happy solution that consigned the mother- 
less babe to an aunt in the rural town of K nuts- 
ford in Cheshire. A happy solution it was for 
the child who thus came to pass the years of her 
girlhood in an atmosphere of affection, in the 
midst of a harmonious and peaceful community 
characterized by quaint customs and habits ami- 
ably peculiar ; it was also a happy chance for 
many a future reader whose heart lias been

warmed by the genial glow of those early years, 
as he has found it reflected in the graceful 
sketches of " Cranford." 

" My dear adopted native town," she calls it 
many years later ; and it was that indeed to 
Elizabeth Stevenson. Her mother was born on 
a near-by farm, and this mother's sister, kindly 
Mrs. Lumb, now became the only mother that 
Elizabeth ever knew. In six of her stories, Mrs. 
Gaskell introduces Knutsford as the scene of the 
narrative disguising, of course, the name. It 
is, however, the classic " Cranford " that con- 
stitutes the epic of this famous little town. Here 
we feel the atmosphere of peaceful, leisurely quiet 
that brooded over this typical English village 
a hundred years ago ; here we meet the simple- 
minded characters that composed its society, 
absorbed in their small round of commonplace 
events : their formal calls, their card-parties, and 
their teas a round of trivialities amid which 
the announcement of an engagement is as start- 
ling as the explosion of a bomb. " ' Marry ! ' 
said Miss Matty once again. ' Well ! I never 
thought of it. Two people that we know going 
to be married. It 's coming very near.' ' Here 
too we see them bravely practicing their " ele- 
gaut economies "; very strict in their reverence 
for etiquette, innocently greedy of gossip, and 
withal thoroughly human in their joys and 
griefs. 

In 1832 Elizabeth Stevenson was married to 
the Rev. William Gaskell, a young Unitarian 
minister in Manchester, the neighboring city 
Drumble, as it is called in " Cranford." The 
marriage was solemnized in Knutsford Church ; 
and the dwellers in the town united to make this 
a gala occasion. The married life of the Gas- 
kells was ideally happy. The husband's tastes 
were those of his wife ; deeply interested in her 
literary success, he stimulated and encouraged 
her every effort. 

It was, however, a very busy life on which 
the young bride entered, and it was ten years 
or more before her career as a writer began. 
Both husband and wife were sincerely interested 
in the welfare of the people about them. Quick 
and tender in her sympathies, Mrs. Gaskell at 
once assumed her share of the obligations that 
fall to the lot of a devoted minister and his wife. 
She organized a sewing class among the working 
girls who met every Saturday evening in the 
minister's house. When they were ill she visited 
and nursed them ; more than once she received 
such patients into her own home that they might 
have proper food and care. With gentle man- 



ner and kindly tact she constantly tried to lead 
them into ways of improvement morally and 
mentally. 

The first novel, " Mary Barton," grew out of 
the life that surrounded the Gaskells. It was 
a realistic study of the industrial situation in 
Manchester, and portrayed the condition of the 
operatives in the mills during that disastrous pe- 
riod known in England as "the hungry forties." 
The story brought a plea for patience with the 
poor. This novel provoked not a little criticism, 
but the power of the narrative was quickly 
recognized and praised by many readers, among 
whom were Charlotte Bronte and Charles Dick- 
ens. In 1850 Dickens invited the author of 
" Mary Barton *' to become a contributor to the 
magazine "Household Words," which he was 
then projecting ; and to the first number of that 
publication Mrs. Gaskell contributed the short 
story "Lizzie Leigh." The first instalment of 
" Cranford " appeared in the same magazine in 
December, 1851. This work was not planned 
as a novel, and owed its continuance to the pop- 
ularity of the opening sketch. In this manner 
the successive sketches appeared under titles 
like " Our Society at Cranford," " A Love Af- 
fair at Cranford," " The Great Panic at Cran- 
ford," etc. This fact explains the rather loose 
connection of the narratives and the lack of or- 
ganic structure that is demanded in a novel ; but 
the peculiarity in composition has taken nothing 
from the charm of the work. Who ever read 
" Cranford " without delight ? and who that 
reads at all has not read this little masterpiece 
of humor and pathos? 

The earlier writings of Mrs. Gaskell, with the 
exception of "Cranford," deal mainly with the 
simple and often tragic annals of the poor. The 
moral trials of her lowly characters, accentuated 
and intensified by the severe conditions of their 
life, stirred her heart profoundly. There is of 
necessity a large measure of sadness and shadow 
in these tales. In her later stories, notably in 
" Cousin Phillis" and "Wives and Daughters," 
the novelist enters a sunnier field of fiction ; the 
atmosphere is bright and cheerful. Overshad- 
owed by the genius of more famous novelists, 
the talents and achievements of the author of 
" Cranford " have possibly been underestimated 
in the past ; but the interest shown in the recent 
anniversary of her birth, and the appearance of 
the notable volume here reviewed, are evidence 
of Elizabeth Gaskell's enduring hold upon the 
affection of readers of to-day.

**TIIE (JLOiiY THAT WAS GIIEECE."* 

" Never in all the world's history was there such a 
leap of civilization as in Greece of the fifth century. In 
one town of about thirty thousand t-iti/eus during the 
lifetime of a man and his father these things occurred: 
A world-conquering power was shattered forever, a 
naval empire was built up, the drama was developed to 
full stature, sculpture grew from crude infancy to a 
height it has never yet surpassed, painting became a 
fine art, architecture rose from clumsiness to the limit 
of its possibilities in one direction, history was consum- 
mated as a scientific art, the most influential of philoso- 
phies was begotten. And all this under no fostering 
despot, but in the extreme human limit of liberty, 
equality, and fraternity. One Athenian family might 
have known Miltiades, Themistocles, vEschylus, Sopho- 
cles, Euripides, Socrates, Pheidias, Pericles, Anaxagoras, 
Aristophanes, Herodotus, Thucydides, Polyguotus, and 
Ictinus." 

Such was the Grand Century, concerning the 
significance of which so many men whose ac- 
quaintance with the Greek language is nothing, 
and whose knowledge of history begins with the 
day before yesterday, are wont to be skeptical. 
If the true test of a State is the number of men 
and movements it produces that enjoy enduring 
fame and influence, Athens, with her little citi- 
zenship of a score and a half of thousands, was 
a far more significant factor in human progress 
than any capital of modern times. Before con- 
cluding that the importance of Hellenic culture 
has been exaggerated, the practically educated 
(or uneducated) metropolitan boaster should 
stop and count up the men of his own city's his- 
tory who are likely to be remembered for twenty- 
five hundred years ; or he should take some pains 
to ascertain what would be left of the fabric of 
modern civilization if the Greek strands were 
drawn out of it. 

" The Glory That Was Greece " is an admir- 
able performance, and both scholar and general 
reader will be thankful for it, and will look for- 
ward with pleasant anticipation to " The Gran- 
deur That Was Rome," which is promised for 
next year. Mr. Stobart's enumeration, in the 
above quoted paragraph, of the features which 
distinguished the life of Periclean times is indi- 
cative of his method. His chapters are composed 
of successions of short essays whose total result 
is to afford the reader a survey of each period 
^Egean, Heroic, Transitional, Grand Century, 
Fourth Century, Macedonian from every im- 
portant angle. The Grand Century chapter is 
of course the nucleus of the book. The abundant 
and really fine full-page cuts which illustrate but

do not dominate the subject-matter are as com- 
prehensive as the text itself. Landscape, archi- 
tecture, sculpture, vases, and painting, arc all 
generously represented. Greek literatim-, too, 
is called upon to contribute the rare li^lit and 
grace of which it is capable. The book is in the 
nature of anthology and art collection all in one. 

Mr. Stobart's work may be further described 
as one of the products of mitigated specialization 
for which the world has of late been crying out. 
It has its faults, to be sure, but they are neither 
numerous nor serious. The reader should not 
be left with the impression that the second stra- 
tum of the Schliemann excavation was the Troy 
of Homer ; someone blundered by inserting a 
second picture of the Theseum in the place of 
the fine old temple at Psestum, which we should 
enjoy much more ; the binding of the volume 
is hardly dignified enough to be in keeping 
with the contents ; and the author is almost too 
fond of emphasizing his disagreements with other 
scholars. But these matters are hardly worth 
mention. The reader will enjoy Mr. Stobart '> 
independence and his flashes of vivacity, and will 
admire him for his gift of judgment in the ex- 
clusion of irrelevant matter, and for his sympa- 
thetic setting forth of what is really significant. 
He makes no pretense of recording all the facts, 
nor indeed of knowing them all, though every 
page indicates easy command of the subject. His 
work is not of the sort which the Gentle Reader 
describes, in which "There are exhaustive argu- 
ments now on the one side and now on the other, 
which exactly balance one another. There are 
references to bulky volumes, where at the foot 
of every page the notes run along, like little 
angry dogs barking at the text." His purpose 
is to make his presentation popular in the best 
sense by reciting the essential facts regarding 
Hellenic culture and helping the reader to form 
an opinion, and he has succeeded admirably, so 
far as success is possible with a subject which 
is by nature intellectually aristocratic. 

In one respect, not all of the lovers of Hel- 
lenism will agree with Mr. Stobart. " I belie \ . 
he says, " that our art and literature have by tin* 
time absorbed and assimilated what Greece had 
to teach, and that our roots are so entwined with 
the soil of Greek culture that we can never lose 
the taste of it as long as books are read and pic- 
tures painted. We are, in fact, living on the 
legacy of Greece, and we may, if we please, for- 
get the testatrix." The inference seems to be 
that there need be no regret for the passing of 
the Greek classics from our education.

antly mixed metaphor, let us say that it may be 
true that what Greece had for us has been ab- 
sorbed and assimilated by some generations of 
modern times ; but let us add that in our opinion 
no generation will receive anything like the full 
inspiration and power that come from the Hel- 
lenic source without absorbing and assimilating 
the Greek spirit afresh for itself. No doubt we 
shall not soon lose the taste of Greek culture, 
and no doubt we shall do fairly well without first- 
hand contact with it in our educational system ; 
but the real question is not whether we are to 
do fairly well, but whether we are to do our best. 
There have been too many famous examples of 
great men whose genius was fertilized by en- 
nobling familiarity with Greek literature for us 
to give a too facile consent to its neglect.

THE IjIFE-STORY OF A COTTOX-MLLL, 
OPERATIVE.* 



Mr. Priddy's "Life of a Mill-Boy " is a vivid 
story of personal experience in cotton mills, amid 
industrial and domestic conditions which tend to 
destroy vitality of body, mind, and soul. Much 
has been written during the last quarter-century 
regarding mill operatives, from the point of view 
of the legislator, the researcher in economics, 
and the social worker. Here is a narrative of 
actual life, bald and frank in its realism, drama- 
tic in its action, and forceful in appeal to the 
reader's imagination and sympathy. It is a sad 
life-story of a youth, doomed from boyhood for 
seven years to endure the physical strain, the 
mental atrophy, and the moral deterioration 
which impure air, and hard, vulgar environment, 
would produce in a boy of delicate and sensitive 
nature. 

The book is not alone a picture of industrial 
evils, which were more widespread a decade ago 
than they are to-day under improved legislation 
and inspection, but it is also a contribution to 
the literature of adolescence. It might be used 
as a treatise on child- welfare, or as a tract upon 
the results of alcoholism. With intimate details, 
the author has unfolded his life from ten to 
twenty years, from his departure from Hadfield 
in England and his arrival in New Bedford, 
Massachusetts, to share the home of an uncle 
and aunt who were confirmed inebriates, through 
service in the mills as sweeper, a doffer, and a 
joiner, until he makes a dash for freedom and

education in a Western college. There are pic- 
torial scenes, the memory of his last Christmas 
eve in England, with carol-singing and festivity 
without and gloom and hunger within ; the first 
day in America, with its alternate hopes and 
disappointments ; the revels and brawls of " the 
gang," led by "Peter One Leg-and-a-Half "; 
the fleeting yet recurrent ambitions to improve 
his mind and shake off the thralldom of the 
machine. The fearful strain of ten and a half 
hours daily in the mill upon the boy who was 
only thirteen years of age, but had been admitted 
to work through his uncle's perjury, is revealed 
in direct statement : " I gulped in the fresh air 
when out of the mill, and walked with my chest 
thrown out, a stiff, self-conscious, growing lad, 
fighting ever against the impending tragedy of a 
deformed body." Again, at sixteen, after three 
years in a mill-room, he reached a climax of de- 
spair : " My body had been beaten into a terrify- 
ing weakness and lassitude by the rigors of the 
mill. My aesthetic sense of things had been 
rudely, violently assaulted by profanity, immor- 
ality, and vile indecencies. I had come to that 
fatalistic belief, which animates so many in the 
mill, that the social bars are set up, and are set 
up forever. I should always have to be in the 
mill." Gradually, through the influences of 
evening schools, second-hand books bought at 
Salvation Army salvage rooms, and acquaint- 
ance with two educated foremen, his dormant 
manhood and ambitions were stirred to activity 
and emancipation. 

One of the most interesting and dispassionate 
chapters is that which relates to the strike of 
forty thousand employees in New Bedford, a 
struggle for four months which ended in de- 
feat for the strikers. Although allied with the 
strikers at the time, the author says : " The con- 
duct of the strike, as I looked on it from behind 
the scenes, was simply a political enterprise. Our 
leader kept urging us to resist. He himself was 
not working in the mill but was getting his money 
from our dues. Several of our meetings were 
no more than drinking bouts. The strike man- 
ager, who conducted our part in it, elected his 
closest friends to important offices which offered 
good remuneration." 

In the background of this Autobiography is 
another romantic tragedy, grim and sad, a 
picture of the curse which falls upon a home 
where the demon of inebriety is allowed to enter 
and abide. The struggles of Uncle Stanwood, 
whose manhood had become weak and flaccid 
through drink ; and his pathetic efforts to reform 
and to remove temptation from his dissipated

wife, " with an electric temper," are incidents 
of real pathos. In keeping with its bald real- 
ism, the author has used freely the vernacular

upon a background of heavy, sordid gloom with 
scarcely a gleam of sunshine. There are sev- 
eral good illustrations in color by Wladyslaw

KECENT FICTION.* 

There has been of recent years a noticeable decline 
in the vitality of Mrs. Humphry Ward's fiction. Her 
themes have seemed to become more forced and 
artificial, and her workmanship to become dulled. 
While her conscientiousness has compelled admira- 
tion, and the intellectual quality of her work has been 
maintained upon a high plane of excellence, we have 
somehow lost the sense of eager anticipation with 
which we awaited a new book from her pen a score of 
years ago. "The Case of Richard Meynell " comes 
nearer to exciting us in the old way than anything 
eke she has done for a long time. It is, frankly, 
nothing more than a revised version of Robert Els- 
mere," and those who were unmoved by that famous 
book will do well to pass its successor by ; on the 
other hand, those to whom religion is one of the 
most important of human concerns, and its rescue 
from the tangle of theological cobwebs one of the 
noblest objects of human endeavor, will get from the 
new novel much the same sort of thrill and inspira- 
tion that they got from its prototype. The contrast 
between the two, in the matter of outcome, is striking. 
Robert Elsmere was too far in advance of his time 
to hope for anything but failure, and the dead weight 
of tradition was too heavy for him to move. But 
Richard MeynelTs outlook, twenty years later, is very 
different. The leaven of liberalism has been working 
all the while, quietly but effectively, and the time is 
ripe for a spiritual revolution. The modernist move- 
ment of which he becomes the leader has gathered 
such momentum that buoyancy rather than despair 
is the keynote of his activities, and he is fully per- 
suaded that the stars in their courses are on the side 
of his cause. His work takes the form of an organized 
movement to soften the creeds and intellectualize the 
life of the Church of England, and as parish after

parish enlists under the new banner of spiritual 
freedom the final triumph of modernism becomes 
more and more certain. Meynell and 1m fellow- 
protestants may upon technical grounds be dispos- 
MMed of their livings, but their ideas are marching 
irresistibly onward toward the goal of a church that 
shall embody the spiritual life of the whole nation. 
These men no longer plead for toleration : they boldly 
demand their rights as representatives of the new 
religious conscience. Mrs. Ward is not, we think, 
unfair in her presentation of the reactionary side of 
the argument. The figure of the Bishop is no less 
sympathetically presented than that of the clergyman 
who opposes him, and equally compels our adiuintt ion 
for his steadfastness and devotion. But it is clem 
that the type of ecclesiasticism for which he .stands 
has well-nigh had its day. It must not be supposed 
that Mrs. Ward's novel is wholly one of religious 
controversy, although this provides its central motive. 
There is much interest of the more human and even 
dramatic sort, provided in part by Meynell's love for 
the daughter of Robert Elsmere, and by the network 
of suspicion and calumny that entangles him when 
he maintains his pledge of secrecy to a friend long 
since dead. To reveal that secret would bring shame 
upon a woman whose subsequent conduct has more 
than atoned for a youthful lapse, and brand with 
illegitimacy a girl whose high-strung nature could 
not survive such a blow. So Meynell suffers the 
evil-minded to think of him as the sinner, and to 
forge of the calumny a weapon for use against him 
in the religious crusade. Of course, the truth come* 
out, as it usually does, clearing Meynell's character, 
but with tragic consequences for the girl. The whole 
complication is rather difficult to follow, because it 
takes for granted a somewhat more vivid recollection 
of certain earlier novels than most readers are likely 
to have preserved. We close the book with a feeling 
that the author has cast her old spell upon us, and 
with a sense of vigorous intellectual and spiritual 
exercise that few others have a comparable power 
to impart. 

Mrs. Harrison ("Lucas Malet") is a serious 
artist, and her work is entitled to the highest respect. 
With her, character is always the main considera- 
tion in which respect she is more French than 
English in method and such things as plot, inci- 
dent, and situation are only of value as they help u- 
to understand motive and temperament. Hence the 
mere story of ' Adrian Savage " is a rather thin 
affair. Adrian is an Englishman turned French, 
a graceful figure in Parisian intellectual society, and 
the editor of a review. He loves an elusive French 
lady with restrained passion and in the mo-t deco- 
rous way imaginable. The only fly in his ointment 
is her sympathetic interest in a decadent painter, 
which becomes serious only in Adrian's exaggerated 
fears, and ceases to cloud his hopes when the painter 
conveniently becomes insane. But Adrian has also 
English connections, and is unexpectedly called 
across the Channel by a death which makes him 
trustee of an estate which has descended to the two

Misses Smyrthwaite, his cousins. The duty is unwel- 
come, but he accepts it gracefully, and finds him- 
self spending some time in the English country 
place, which is to him the most depressing environ- 
ment imaginable. Of the two sisters, one is good- 
looking and stolid ; the other is distressingly plain 
but endowed with the intensity of nature that is 
usually the warrant of unhappiness. This young 
woman, Joanna by name, keeps a journal, and in 
its pages she reveals herself as never by word of 
mouth to any human being. And the tragedy of it all 
is that Joanna, mistaking her cousin's courtly bearing 
and polished manner for signs of a deep personal in- 
terest, persuades herself that she has become the ob- 
ject of his affections. When he realizes this dread- 
ful misunderstanding, he is naturally uncomfortable, 
although no act or thought has given him cause for 
self-reproach. And when the young woman, after 
confidently revealing to him her fatuous self-delusion, 
learns how utterly without foundation are all her 
hopes, there is nothing left for her but suicide. The 
situation is not agreeable to read about, but the power 
of its portrayal is insistent, and as a study in mor- 
bid introspection, the character of Joanna must be 
recognized as a masterpiece. There is endless 
psychologizing in the book ; the people concerned all 
analyze themselves and each other, and the writer 
analyzes them again on her own account. This 
process makes them all surprisingly real, and there 
is much vivid incident to heighten the effect. The 
style, whether in description, illumination, self- 
revelation, or dialogue, has the mark of a distinc- 
tion which is anything but common in our latter-day 
fiction, and which makes "Lucas Malet" a writer 
always to be reckoned with. We cannot quite place 
this work upon the plane of " Sir Richard Calmady," 
but it does not need to stand as high as that to be 
considered a remarkable novel. 

Mr. and Mrs. Castle, in " The Composer," have 
taken a leaf from the Wagnerian legend, and en- 
deavored to create a super-musician whose genius 
holds the world in awe. His came is Lothnar, the 
temple of his worship is Frankheim, and he writes 
amazing music-dramas based upon the Greek myths. 
A young singer, Fraulein Sarolta, comes under his 
spell, and is chosen to interpret his heroines 
Iphigenia, Phaedra, and the rest. He becomes the 
god of her idolatry, not only as genius but as man, 
and the fact that she is not contented to worship 
him as a genius alone is her undoing. The situa- 
tion is a little difficult to take in, for Lothnar is per- 
sonally anything but prepossessing, and the girl's 
mad infatuation makes a heavy demand upon our 
credulity. By the time she realizes that he lives 
only for his art, and that he has played upon her 
emotions solely with the aim of making her a better 
singer, she has run the whole gamut of exaltation 
and agony, and is ready to accept the dog-like de- 
votion of the stolid young Englishman who has all 
the time been hovering in the background. Some- 
thing is broken within her, but the mechanism of 
life somehow keeps on running, and she must make 



the best of it. The Castles are particularly good 
at this sort of temperamental melodrama, and we 
may not deny that the present tale, although any- 
thing but convincing, successfully maintains its arti- 
ficial interest. 

When George Bellew, American millionaire, 
crosses the Atlantic in his yacht in pursuit of a 
young woman, and then learns that she has bestowed 
her affections elsewhere, he thinks he is broken- 
hearted. Whereupon he slings a pack over his 
shoulders, and takes to the road in Kent. After 
sundry adventures by the wayside, he encounters a 
small boy, becomes chummy with him, and learns 
that he has set out in quest of a fortune to retrieve 
the distress of his Aunt Anthea, whose farm is mort- 
gaged, and who cannot make both ends meet. George 
persuades his new friend to take him to the farm, 
and discovers that it is Arcadia, in very fact, and that 
its mistress is a dream of loveliness. He persuades 
her to take him in as a boarder, and makes himself 
very much at home. Presently he saves the family 
furniture from going at auction, and puts a spoke 
in the wheel of the squire, who is taking a mean 
advantage of Anthea, profiting by her distress to 
force her into a loveless marriage. With the small 
boy as a fellow-conspirator, he arranges to have a 
buried fortune discovered on the grounds just in 
time to pay the mortgage that its skinflint holder is 
about to foreclose. It seems that this marvel is pos- 
sible only under certain conditions at the full of the 
moon, in other words, when there is " a money 
moon." Hence this pretty tale by Mr. Jeffery 
Farnol is called " The Money Moon," and is fairly 
drenched with romantic sentiment. The happy 
day does not go until the maiden yields, but it re- 
quires both strategy and masterful action to bring 
about this consummation. This is the merest trifle 
of a book in comparison with the author's "Broad 
Highway," and consequently disappoints us not a 
little, but it has enough grace and tender idyllic 
charm to make it measurably worth while. 

The romantic story of the Austrian archduke who 
separated himself from civilization some twenty 
years ago, his subsequent history and fate to re- 
main a mystery, has been taken by Mr. Lloyd 
Osbourne for the groundwork of the tale which he 
entitles " A Person of Some Importance." Last 
year, it will be remembered, the missing man was 
declared to be legally dead, and his estate settled. 
Mr. Osbourne's invention ( for which there is some 
shadow of historical support) represents the arch- 
duke as having concealed himself, in company with 
the lady for whom he thought the world well lost, 
upon a remote island in the South Pacific, and as 
having died there after his twenty years of self- 
imposed exile. The name "John Orth," which 
he is known to have taken, here becomes "John 
Mort." The story is primarily concerned with 
one Matthew Broughton, in training for the navy, 
but dismissed in disgrace from the Annapolis 
Academy for participation in a hazing outrage. He 
ships before the mast, knocks about the seas for a

while, and finally comes upon " John Mort," 1>\ 
whom he is made a sort of confidential agent After 
some years of this life, he wearies of it, and returns 
to his home in New England, pledged to the pro- 
foundest secrecy by his late royal employer. This 
is where the real story begins, for agents of the Aus- 
trian court get upon Broughton's track, and seek to 
extort from him the secret which they are persuaded 
is in his possession. They resort in vain to cajolery, 
bribery, and personal violence. They thwart his 
every attempt to make a living, and when he elopes 
with the daughter of the local magnate, they track 
him to California, lure him on board a ship under 
their control, and carry him to the South Pacific. 
Here, it seems, an Austrian battle-ship, carrying no 
less august a passenger than the Emperor, is await- 
ing their arrival ; and here, moved by the Emperor's 
own plea, Broughton discloses his well-kept secret. 
But when the mysterious island is reached it trans- 
pires that " John Mort " has died a few weeks be- 
fore, and the hopes of his imperial father are crushed. 
Here is obviously the material for a good yarn, and 
as far as invention is concerned, the author has put 
it to fairly good use. But his style is so raw, and 
his characterization so wooden, that our chief feeling 
is one of disappointment that the theme has not 
fallen into hands capable of doing it more justice 
and of more fully realizing its romantic possibilities. 

The latest of Mr. Randall Parrish's ladies is 
called "My Lady of Doubt," and it follows the 
pattern of its predecessors so closely that we always 
know what to expect. It offers a variant only in 
being a Revolutionary romance instead of a tale of 
the Civil War. Its scene is in and about Philadel- 
phia during the last weeks of the British occupation, 
and it culminates in the battle of Monmouth. The 
hero is a Continental spy who has many hairbreadth 
escapes, and the heroine is a young woman who 
alternately aids and thwarts him a procedure 
which keeps him guessing, and accounts for the 
phrase by which she is styled. No wonder the girl 
is perplexed, for her father is in one camp and her 
brother in the other, while she is desperately wooed 
both by the Continental hero and the royalist offi- 
cer who has been her lover from childhood. The 
latter, however, turns out to be so black a villain that 
we waste no sympathy over his discomfiture. Sev- 
eral famous historical figures flit across the pages 
from time to time. 

Another tale of rural Georgia, with most of the 
familiar features of shrewd portraiture and homely 
observation that are found in Mr. Harben's earlier 
books, is now offered us in " Jane Dawson." Jane 
is a hard old woman who has been betrayed in her 
youth and made an outcast. To add to her offend- 
ing, she has become a " free thinker," and her son 
has taken the same course. The latter is a man of 
strong character and clear intelligence, in striking 
contrast to the simple-minded and zealous preacher 
with whom he is at odds. There is a young woman 
who cannot easily choose between the two men, both 
of whom love her ; at last, however, she learns to 



know her own heart, and ^iv- lin-elf to tin- one 
who ban found .shelu-r out>ide the orthodox fold. 
There is a great deal of theological di>cu.s.sioii in 
the course of the story, which makes it rather tire- 
some, because the issues concerned are such as no 
longer exist for thinking people, however much they 
may still affect the ru.-tic mind. The figure of Jane 
is drawn with a good deal of grim power and en- 
dowed with at least a spark of vitality.

nearer us, and has given a wide basis of interest in 
the Malay peoples, and in the industrial, economic, 
sanitary, political, educational, and religious prob- 
lems that arise in connection with the control of 
nature in the tropics, the development of the rich 
resources of equatorial lands, the exploitation of sub- 
ject peoples, and the preservation and growth of an 
indigenous civilization. No nation has had a wider 
experience in this field than Holland, whose immense 
possessions in the East Indies have been an unfailing 
source of wealth to the ruling power for centuries. 
Dutch colonies the East Indies have never really 
become, for the ruling race has never peopled these 
dependencies further than to provide temporary 
staffs for political control, commercial exploitation. 
or scientific exploration. During these centuries of 
Dutch conquest (still in bloody progress in Acheen), 
and of occupation, the relations of the ruling and 
subject peoples have passed through an evolution in 
which the ethical standards of the Dutch nation 
have steadily displaced the lower ones established 
by commercial greed. Policies of extermination of 
resisting tribes and ruthless suppression of rivals in 
trade, which characterized the period of the control 
by trading companies, gave way to forced labor and 
extortionate taxation by agents of the government, 
and this in turn to a more intelligent policy of agri- 
cultural and industrial development of native people- 
and to the initial steps in a system of education. M. 
Cabaton holds no brief for the Malay in his "Java, 
Sumatra, and the Other Islands of the Dutch East 
Indies" (Scribner), but his ably written volume 
gives a clear insight into the nature of the exceed- 
ingly complex and difficult problem which confronts 
the Netherlands of to-day, as it faces the increas- 
ingly insistent demands of the subject peoples for 
wider educational opportunities and greater indus- 
trial and commercial freedom. Java, as well as the 
United States, has its Oriental problem. The recent 
influx of Japanese, following the Russo-Japanese 
war, with their demand for and freely granted equal- 
ity with Europeans, has stimulated the Chinese of 
the Malay ports, who are a large element in inter- 
native commercial life, to obtain Japanese citizenship 
in Formosa and return thence to Batavia with hopes

for enlarged opportunities. When the New China 
knocks at the doors of Malaysia, a new readjustment 
of political and commercial relations in the Far East 
impends. An introduction to the work, by the trans- 
lator, Mr. Bernard Miall, affords a suitable historical 
background for the reader. The book is well illus- 
trated, and gives a detailed, methodical, comprehen- 
sive and exceptionally complete account of the history, 
government, resources, industries, commerce, cus- 
toms, religions of the Dutch East Indies, as well as 
a candid and illuminating statement of the complex 
and pressing problems resulting from contact of the 
Occident and Orient in the land of spices. 

In "Bypaths in Dixie "(Dutton) Mrs. 

Sarah J - Cocke has s iven us . a . series 

of negro fables as entertaining as 
the classic tales of Joel Chandler Harris. Not 
only does Mist'r Race Hoss run for the office of king 
of beasts against Jack Donkey who covers himself 
head and ears to hide his asinine unfitness for that 
exalted office and yet is betrayed by his voice and 
not only does Mis' Race Hoss give a party for her 
husband's benefit, where Sis' Sow and her children 
display their gluttonous propensities ; but also Ned 
Dog and Billy Goat fill one story, conducting them- 
selves in quite human fashion, and even Shoo Fly 
and Hoss Fly enact a drama of their own, which 
fly-paper and screen windows and modern sanitation 
all but bring to a tragic close. Indeed, we are taken 
out into the woods, and learn the life-history of 
Mist'r Bad 'Simmon Tree, and of Big Eye Buzzard, 
who aspired to be accepted in the society of the royal 
eagles and made love to Tishy Peafowel till that 
charming young lady's father exposed the false gal- 
lant's unspeakable leaning to certain improper foods. 
Even Mist'r Rattlesnake plays a part quite scriptural 
and instructive, and Mist'r Grab-all Spider is all 
by himself a monopoly in restraint of trade. The 
stories are delightfully fresh, and, in spite of inevit- 
able similarities, are really unlike the negro fables 
best known. Indeed, they suggest the query whether 
Mrs. Cocke is the inventor, or only the narrator 
with literary privileges of the deeds ascribed 
by Phyllis to the animals. This, however, brings 
us to another phase of the book : it is not simply a 
volume of fables. The whole composition takes 
higher rank in literature than a mere collection of 
stories, by reason of its artistic unity. This unity 
is achieved through the personality of Phyllis, the 
negro mammy who tells the instructive tales, and of 
the little boy Willis, her charge and her audience, 
supplemented at times by his neighbor, little Ma'y 
Van. As the tales follow one after another, the 
face, figure, tones, and gestures of Phyllis become 
vivid and familiar to us, and the two little auditors 
grow more and more lifelike, till we have a Southern 
nursery complete. Even the father and mother, 
though they discreetly refrain from breaking the 
compact unity of the nursery life by actual appear- 
ance on the scene, do now and then pass the door, as 
it were, and cast on the floor characteristic shadows 



of themselves. Phyllis's freedom from interference 
makes her self-revelation the more unconstrained, 
and Mrs. Cocke has succeeded in conveying com- 
pletely into her book the wise, wily, humorous, and 
inventive mammy. She stands apart from the purely 
comic negro and the sentimental negro of much 
dialect fiction, and represents wholesome realism in 
that branch of Southern literature. So excellent is 
Mrs. Cocke's depicting of the character that one 
feels bold to predict for Phyllis a niche beside Uncle 
Remus. Willis and Ma'y Van, too, are creations, 
and the interest of the stories depends largely upon 
our vivid consciousness all the while of the child 
listeners who share them with us ; but the ebony- 
skinned narrator is the heroine of the book. 

The attempt to give any adequate 
Portrayal of twenty leading univer- 
sities of the world within the com- 
pass of a single octavo volume of 275 pages would 
seem a desperate one from the start. Yet if it 
could be successfully done, President Thwing would 
seem to be one of the most promising entries for 
the contest. But a perusal of his recent book must 
prove disappointing to this high expectation. The 
rough-and-ready classification of all universities 
into four groups learning-laboratories, character- 
builders, culture-studies, and efficiency-mills is a 
seductive but perilous snare. It does not prevent 
a sound and appreciative estimate of Oxford and 
London, though the limited space is a bar to ade- 
quacy. But when it denies, or tends to deny, to 
Berlin and Harvard the predicate of efficient, and 
applies it preeminently to Tokyo and Calcutta, the 
danger becomes evident. In the value of the charac- 
terizations and estimates of various institutions there 
is great difference. Many of the observations on the 
University of Madrid seem guarded and just. Such 
epigrams as "Universities are at once the cause and 
the result of the Zeit-Geist," and "The pride, not 
of life, but of living, dominates," and "For lack of 
knowledge the people perish, but never for lack of 
art," are what might be expected from the author 
of "A History of Higher Education in America." 
So much the more striking is the onesidedness of the 
treatment of Vienna, St. Petersburg, and Budapest. 
And so much the more startling the carelessness and 
absolute obscurity of many passages in the chapters 
on these institutions. The treatment as well as the 
language almost compels the conclusion that por- 
tions of these articles were prepared by an ill- 
trained translator. What is to be made, for instance, 
of such expressions as these : " The worthiest men 
which humanity or Austria has given to itself" 
(p. 142). " But, despite this condition,.the Univer- 
sity of Vienna is still [meaning ' nevertheless '] a 
commanding force of the entire world. . . . But in 
respect to students, its six thousand are larger than 
are found in any American institution" (p. 149). 
" Above most great universities of the world Vienna 
does not attract foreign students" (p. 151). "For 
the Hungarian people embody Slavic traditions,

cially numerous " (p. 160). ' The chief building of 
the University . . . lengthens itself out to about 
one thousand feet" (p. 170). Such passages might 
be cited by the score. Despite these defects of 
style, and some judgments from which many well- 
informed persons would dissent, President Th wing's 
book, with its handsome half-tones, will be a welcome 
survey of a great field not often presented to one 
glance of the eye.

eral Butler, " is the finest soldier now

left in the world. And Sir John 
Macdonald told a London audience that " The finest 
moral police in the world is to be found in the priest- 
hood of French Canada." Add to these general 
statements the estimate of Archbishop Ireland, that 
old Father Lacombe of the Oblate Order, now spend- 
ing his last days in his Home for the Poor at Mid- 
napore, is "the most remarkable priest Western 
America has seen," and the life of that noble and pic- 
turesque character, compiled by Katherine Hughes 
and published by Moffat, Yard & Company, would 
seem labor spent on a worthy object. The story, 
told in the simplest chronological fashion, with no 
generalizations, no ecstacies, and no cant, is more 
than an interesting biography : it fulfils its relig- 
ions and ethical purpose more effectively than any 
amount of pointing of morals could do. Born near 
Quebec, with a strain of Indian blood to add ro- 
mance and restlessness to his vivacious French tem- 
perament, active for more than sixty years in the 
stirring affairs of frontier Canada, spirited enough 
to thunder " Thou art the man ! " in the face of the 
all-powerful Hudson Bay Company manager, and 
to camp in the private office of the Canadian Min- 
ister of the Interior until he signs the document 
assuring the Western priesthood financial indepen- 
dence, devoted enough to risk his life again and 
again fighting infectious diseases among his squalid 
parishioners, and again and again in more exciting 
if no more dangerous surroundings, and bubbling 
over from first to last with soul-thrilling eloquence 
and pigeon-English mots, famous over two conti- 
nents and carrying a battered wood and brass cru- 
cifix as "my only decoration," he is at the same 
time one of the most amusing and one of the most 
touching figures of his generation. The book is en- 
titled " Father Lacombe, the Black- Robe Voyageur," 
and is profusely illustrated with photographs and 
charts. 

One needs a somewhat wide general 
knowledge of astronomy, meteor- 
ology, geology, and also biology, to 
handle successfully such a subject as ''The Growth 
of a Planet," when the treatment is as thorough as 
that given by Professor Edwin Sharp Grew. Nearly 
ten years have now elapsed since the publication of 
Sir Robert S. Ball's fascinating work on "The 



Earth's Beginning," and so great has been the pro- 
gress made during that time that a new book setting 
forth the latest researches and speculations is very 
welcome. Mr. Grew's work covers a greater rarge 
than Sir Robert Ball's; for the latter contents him- 
self with a brilliant exposition of the origin of tin* 
earth according to the nebular hypothesis, while the 
former discusses not only the origin but the later hi*- 
tory of our earth, as its face lias been wrinkled and 
furrowed by various agencies, while life, myste- 
riously originating, has developed prodigiously. In- 
stead of following the old nebular hypothesis of 
Laplace, our author expounds the new and distinct- 
ively American theory known as the " planetisimal 
theory," which originated from the labors of Pro- 
fessors Chamberlin and Moulton of the University 
of Chicago, and is making its way throughout the 
world of science. Mr. Grew, or his printers, how- 
ever, take the liberty of calling it the "planetismal " 
theory ; but the Century Dictionary does not recog- 
nize the word. Having started the planets and 
their satellites upon their career, the author wisely 
limits his discussion of their further development 
chiefly to the single case of the earth, where we 
have some solid facts to build upon. Beginning at 
the very foundation, the probable structure of the 
core of the earth is discussed at considerable length ; 
this is followed by a luminous exposition of the 
causes of the present shape of the earth's surface, 
a subject to which certain well-known British scien- 
tists, especially Darwin, Jeans, and Love, have given 
much ingenious study. The modifications of the sur- 
face by volcanoes, earthquakes, and the agencies of 
air and water, are next treated. Finally, the origin 
and development of life, both vegetable and animal, 
have about a fourth of the book allotted to them, the 
whole matter being closed by some brief considera- 
tions as to the future of life on our planet. The 
reader will be convinced of the wide range of the 
author's study, his excellent understanding of the 
various subjects involved, and his power of adequate 
and interesting presentation. (Macmillan Co.) 

Mr. Harry A. Franck, a teacher of 
modern languages, spent four months 
recently in pedestrian travel in the 
land of Don Quixote, and the record of his expe- 
riences is published by the Century Company, with 
the title " Four Months Afoot in Spain." The title is 
a trifle misleading, since occasional resort to the rail- 
road was necessary in order to enable the traveller 
to complete a zigzag itinerary between Gibraltar and 
Paris during the time at his disposal. The preface 
claims a utilitarian motive, and the author is careful 
to keep us in touch with bin expenses, which totalled 
$172 from New York to New York. The modesty 
of the figure is due in some degree to the generosity 
j of the Gallicians in the northwest, who magnani- 
mously contributed to Mr. Franrk's literary enter- 
prise by furnishing him free meals and lodging. The 
i book is extremely amusing, even useful, for it gives 
I a view of Spanish life that could scarcely be found

elsewhere ; since foreigners in general have seen only 
the edges, so to speak, and the Spaniard is naturally 
unable to see himself. In one respect the book is al- 
most absolutely unique: written by a foreigner, it 
nevertheless vigorously defends the institution of the 
bull-fight. The reader who knows Spain and Spanish 
will suspect that the author has sometimes fallen a 
prey to his instinct for literary effect, and will re- 
gret that the proof of the frequently-recurring bits 
of Spanish, inserted to give local color, was not more 
carefully read ; but for popular reading the story is 
a distinct success. The same writer has already pub- 
lished an account of "A Vagabond Journey Round 
the World," and is now on his way to South 
America, where he will collect material for a third 
book of a similar character. 



The treasure* Evei 7 vear the number o f European 
and pleasures tourists increases, and year after year 
of Florence. a new cro p o f travel-books and art- 
manuals springs up to meet the cry for the " latest 
guide." Hardy annuals we can scarcely call them, 
since most of these publications, carefully compiled 
though they be, fail to reach a second edition. Is 
it because hybrids are not infrequently sterile ? At 
any rate, the travel books that live are few, and 
usually of two sorts : works of pure originality like 
Gautier's or Howells's ; and the humbler but more 
useful guide, such as the perennial Baedeker. Ap- 
proaching this type in its objectivity and wealth of 
information, but naturally far more complete on the 
artistic aspect of its subject, is Mr. Herbert Vaughan's 
" Florence and Her Treasures " (Macmillan), a book 
which the average traveller will find a real guide, 
philosopher, and friend. The history and descrip- 
tion of Florence, with her churches, palaces, galleries, 
and museums, would furnish the material for many 
volumes, and any attempt to condense it into 375 
duodecimo pages will provoke criticism from some 
quarter; but in the main Mr. Vaughan's selection 
will please the traveller who is not himself a spe- 
cialist. An interesting account of the Festivals at 
Florence is given, and the notes on the paintings 
and statues are supplemented by brief index-lists of 
artists and a somewhat summary but useful chapter 
on Saints and their Symbols. The illustrations, 
which are clearly printed in beautiful half-tone, are 
a special feature of this little guide book, which, 
although a trifle corpulent, is small enough for the 
masculine coat-pocket. 



Psychology 
and business 
efficiency. 



Professor Walter Dill Scott, in his 
volume on " Increasing Efficiency in 
Business" (Macmillan), makes a 
direct appeal in plain language to the plain man. 
It brings psychology to the street in the conceptions 
and interests of the street. In so doing there is 
danger of assigning dominance to the motives, pur- 
poses, and methods of the street, and forsaking the 
principles of a larger psychology in an eagerness to 
serve the narrower clientele. The reactions of theory 
and practice are legitimately reciprocal; but the 



dominance belongs to principle, and the eking out of 
principle to suit the shifting demands of a practice 
bringing with it the provincialisms of its own environ- 
ment is in the long run neither profitable nor justifi- 
able. Despite transgression in this particular, the 
chapters of this book show a creditable success in 
carrying the message of psychological economy into 
business. They set forth the utilization of such varied 
procedures as imitation, competition, loyalty, concen- 
tration, rewards, pleasures, relaxations, the sporting 
instinct, in advancing the cause of efficiency as tested 
and gauged by market values. The spirit of the 
application is pointed if not profound, compromis- 
ing rather than directive. Yet if the implication be 
avoided that the mission and even the plain lesson 
of psychology begins and ends here, the book will be 
beneficial within its chosen limitations. '' A contri- 
bution to the psychology of business " is open to the 
serious danger of having the shadow of business 
obscure the illumination of psychology. 

Logically, from its title, one would 

8U PPp se " The Man Who Likes 
Mexico " (The Century Co.) a biog- 
raphy, or perhaps a tale, of someone who, yielding 
to the lure of the marvellous land within the tropics, 
has continued to like the land and its people upon 
closer acquaintance. Mr. Wallace Gillpatrick, in the 
book above named, gives an account of his varied ex- 
periences during the first two of the six years in which 
he has resided in Republica Mexicana. And though 
the title may be criticized, the book itself is worthy 
a high place among works on Mexico. Mr. Gill- 
patrick saw not only the capital and that part of 
the country which most travellers see, but he be- 
came acquainted with the northwestern provinces, 
the region of mountains and mines, which had for 
him the chief charm. He is thus able to add some- 
thing fresh and new to the already enormous litera- 
ture of travel and sight-seeing in Mexico. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



A new two-volume edition of the " Poems and Dramas 
of George Cabot Lodge" (Hough ton) is accompanied 
by a third volume, giving a biography of the poet. He 
has illustrious sponsors (if we may adopt the theory that 
being dead, he is born into fame), for Mr. Theodore 
Roosevelt writes the introduction to the poems, and 
Mr. Henry Adams is the author of the biography. It 
is a brilliant achievement which is here embodied and 
commemorated. 

Mathematical prodigies will doubtless enjoy "Div- 
a-Let," a new " pastime or mental diversion mostly in- 
tended for those who are fond of such things," as the 
sub-title informs us. In " Div-a-Let " a word is taken, 
each letter being assigned one of the digits, in their 
order, and then the numbers are used in an ordinary 
long-division sum. The sum next is written out using 
the letters instead of the numbers, and from that, the 
player or victim is expected to recover the original 
word. Literally speaking, this may be a mental diver- 
sion, but there are numbers of people to whom it would

be anything but a pastime. The ingenious author it 
Dr. W. H. Vail, and the book is printed by the Revell 
Co. Press. Scattered through the book are a number 
of slips containing poems. Unless these be for the 
consolation of Dr. Vail's non-mathematical readers, it 
is hard to imagine their relation to the weird pastime 
here outlined. 

Mr. Robert Hichens's book descriptive of " Egypt 
and Its Monuments," which was issued with the re- 
markable illustrations in color by Mr. Jules Gue*rin, is 
now reissued by the Century Co. in a small inexpensive 
edition, without illustrations, but with the reading mat- 
ter complete. In this more handy form it will be wel- 
comed by travellers or prospective travellers in Egypt, 
as well as by all admirers of Mr. Hichens who do not 
have access to the larger book. 

Handbooks on Christian Symbolism are numerous, 
and they differ chiefly in the manner in which they 
present the subject. In Elizabeth E. Goldsmith's 
44 Sacred Symbols in Art " (Putnam) an attempt is 
made to present a guidebook to the interpretation of 
the great religious paintings in the galleries of Europe. 
The illustrations, most of which are a departure from 
the conventional selection, make the book of value to 
the student at home, as an aid to a better under- 
standing of the symbolic phases of religious art. 

Critical followers of the modern drama will welcome 
" Modern Drama and Opera," a reading list of works of 
ten foremost dramatists and four operatic composers, 
compiled by Mrs. Clara Norton, Mr. Frank K. Walter, 
and Miss Fannie Elsie Marquand, and published by the 
Boston Book Company. The dramatists whose works 
are covered are D'Annunzio, Hauptmann, Ibsen, Henry 
Arthur Jones, Maeterlinck, Stephen Phillips, Pinero, 
Rostand, Shaw, and Sudermann. The composers are 
Debussy, Puccini, and Richard Strauss. Under the head 
of each author are given lists of his works, summaries 
of each play, and references to the best criticism of the 
plays. A special section deals with the general literature 
on dramatic technique, theory, and criticism. 

Three new volumes have just been issued by the 
Penn Publishing Co. in their series of " Popular Hand- 
books." Mr. C. T. Davies contributes a small volume, 
" The Horse and How to Care For Him " whose scope 
is indicated by its sub-title, How to choose a horse, 
tell his age, feed, stable, harness and train him, and keep 
him in good health." A number of diagrams aid this 
exposition. Mr. John H. Bechtel gives a short diction- 
ary of " Biblical Quotations " arranged under the heads 
of the human experiences to which they severally apply. 
The party hostess or harassed parent will welcome the 
third volume, Home Games " by Mr. George Hapgood, 
in which games of bodily and mental skill, chance, and 
observation are simply explained. 

" The Position of Women in Indian Life," by Her 
Highness the Maharani of Baroda and Mr. S. M. Mitra, 
offers a most striking example of an unfortunate title; 
for it treats of the activities of women in every land ex- 
cept India. The purpose of the book is to aid in the 
reasonable emancipation and elevation of Indian women 
by giving an account of " Western feminine institutions" 
which might be adopted to meet Eastern requirements. 
From this point of view, the authors write upon such 
themes as " Agriculture," Professions for Women," 
" Philanthropic Work," " Domestic Science," " Co- 
operation," "Rescue Work," and "Women in Japan." 
The work is thoroughly well done, whether one con- 
siders the results of investigation or the manner of pre- 



sentation; and the book will take its place among the 
laudable efforts made by the enlightened and progres- 
sive rulers of Baroda to promote the well-being of their 
subjects. For the Western reader, it will be interesting 
mainly as an indication of this important activity, and 
as offering a number of incidental references to condi- 
tions in India. (Longmans, Green, & Co.) 

To the " History of the Sciences " series, published in 
London by the Rationalist Press Association and in this 
country by the Putnams, a History of Biology " is con- 
tributed by L. C. Miall, F.K.S. The limitation of space 
imposed in the general editorial plan of the series makes 
impossible anything like an adequate treatment of the 
development of biology. Only the most salient points 
of fact can be brought out. So much is well done ; but 
a history which is obliged to delete almost completely 
the personal element cannot be said to afford particularly 
entertaining reading. 

Statistics of crime and criminals thus far compiled in 
this country by the state and federal governments are 
of very uneven value and are generally useless. The 
well-trained statistician is rare, and few of the best type 
are in local and state service. According to Mr. Louis 
N. Robinson, author of a " History of Criminal Statistics 
in the United States "(Hough ton), the most hopeful way 
to reach sound results lies in the direction of federal 
leadership in registration areas upon a uniform plan. 
This study represents much labor, and will help explor- 
ers, but does not add much to expert knowledge of the 
subject. It will be useful in concentrating public atten- 
tion upon the need of improvement in methods in this 
important field. 

Since Mr. George Wharton James first issued his book, 
" In and Around the Grand Canyon of the Colorado " 
(Little, Brown & Co.) many changes have been made in 
the mapping and naming of different parts of the Canyon, 
in the available trails through its explorable parts, and 
in the hotel and other accommodations for the tourist, 
That he might include the latest results of work on the 
Canyon by the United States Geological Survey, as well 
as the other changes just mentioned, Mr. James has 
issued a new edition of his book with the necessary re- 
writing to bring it to date. He has included in the vol- 
ume a new map of the Canyon, containing many names, 
suggested by himself, now adopted for newly charted 
or rechristened points of interest. In an appendix are 
given a number of newly determined heights and other 
dimensions of peaks, towers, buttes, etc., which hitherto 
have been estimated only. 

The geographical availability of Colorado to the aver- 
age American, and especially to the dweller in the Mis- 
sissippi Valley, makes it inevitable that the " colored " 
State should become more and more the summer resort 
of those who seek pure air, while its possibilities for 
permanent homes have but begun to be appreciated. In 
view of these facts, a handy book of information, neatly 
printed and supplied with tables and a map, must meet 
a growing demand. Mr. Eugene Parsons had already 
written the history of Colorado, and seems to be a fit 
person to supply the Guidebook to that State wlm-h 
Messrs. Little, Brown & Co. have just issued. The body 
of the book is arranged by counties in alphabetical order, 
while a good index renders the carefully compiled in- 
formation accessible from any point of view. The book 
is illustrated with over seventy fine half-tones. An- 
other good feature is the table of distances and rail- 
road rates.

NOTES. 



The first chapters of a new novel by Mr. William J. 
Locke, entitled " Stella Maris," appear in the January 
" Century." 

" Multitude and Solitude " is the title of a new novel 
by Mr. John Masefield, author of " The Tragedy of 
Nan," The Street of To-day," etc., which Mr. Mitchell 
Kennerley will soon publish. 

" Barnes's Popular History of the United States," for 
many years a standard text-book, has been brought up 
to date and issued by the Baker & Taylor Co. in a hand- 
some octavo volume of 780 pages. 

A new novel by Miss Anne Douglas Sedgwick, author 
of "A Fountain Sealed," "Amabel Channice," etc., is 
announced for early publication by the Century Co. under 
the title of "Tante." 

Mr. Jeffery Farnol, author of " The Broad Highway," 
is planning a visit to this country as soon as he completes 
his new novel, " The History of an Amateur Gentleman," 
which will be published in book form by Messrs. Little, 
Brown & Co. 

The selection of Meredith letters which Lord Morley 
is editing will be published in the course of next autumn 
by the Messrs. Scribner. The letters are not to be 
linked into a biography, but will simply be arranged in 
a natural way, with notes by Lord Morley where notes 
are necessary. 

" The Book-Lovers' Anthology," edited by Mr. R. M. 
Leonard, will be issued immediately by Mr. Henry 
Frowde. It consists of passages in poetry and prose 
relating to books in all their aspects, grouped according 
to the subject. Some two hundred and fifty authors in 
all are represented. 

John Bigelow's death leaves his " Retrospections of 
an Active Life " uncompleted. The Baker & Taylor 
Co. issued the first three volumes of these reminiscences 
two years ago, and it is understood that Mr. Bigelow 
left the material for the remaining volumes in a condi- 
tion which will permit of its being promptly prepared 
for the press by his son, Major Bigelow. 

The "English Readings for Schools" of Messrs. Henry 
Holt & Co. constitute one of the most attractive and care- 
fully-edited series of texts now available. The latest 
additions to the series are " Ivanhoe," edited by Mr. 
Alfred A May; the "Sketch Book," edited by Mr. A. W. 
Leonard; Stevenson's " Inland Voyage " and " Travels 
with a Donkey," edited by Mr. Edwin Mims; and 
Macaulay's " Clive " and " Hastings," edited by Messrs. 
F. E. Pierce and Samuel Thurber, Jr. 

Freytag's " Die Journalisten " (Merrill) is once more 
edited for school use, this time by Mr. H. A. Potter, who 
supplies the usual apparatus for student use. Another 
excellent text is Fontane's "Grete Minds" (Holt), 
edited by Mr. H. W. Thayer. The reading-book of "Ger- 
man Epics Retold" (American Book Co.), compiled by 
Mr. M. Bine Holly, gives in German prose, with quota- 
tions, the substance of ten mediaeval works, including the 
Parzival, Lohengrin, and Tristan stories, the " Heliard," 
the " Nibelungenlied," the " Woltarilied," and the Song 
of Gudrun.

in some sense not wholly irrevocable. Fire- proof build- 
ings are to be erected for the safe keeping of these pre- 
cious memorials. The incorporators include many men 
well known in their various professions and occupations. 
Mrs. Arthur Stannard, a novelist better known through 
her pseudonym of John Strange Winter, died in London 
on the 14th of December. She was a most prolific fic- 
tion writer, her total output being nearly 100 volumes. 
Her stories were chiefly about army life, and John 
Ruskin referred to her as " the author to whom we owe 
the most finished and faithful rendering ever yet given 
of the character of the British soldier." Among her 
works that became popular both in Europe and America 
are " Booties' Baby," The Soul of the Bishop," " Only 
Human," Houpla," and " The Truth Tellers." She 
was fifty-six years of age. 

Early in the present month Mr. William T. Price of 
New York will begin publication of a monthly review, 
" The American Playwright," devoted to the technical 
discussion of plays and playwriting. It will aim to 
give such full information as is desired and needed by 
students of the drama; and will contain a complete 
record of plays produced in New York and of all credit- 
able published plays and books and articles relating to 
the technical side of the stage. Its reviews of current 
plays will be analytical, directed at their causes of fail- 
ure or success. Its various departments will be designed 
to help, in a practical way, those who accept playwrit- 
ing as an art. 

The list of private collectors of books and literaria in 
the United States, which was printed in " The Annual 
Library Index, 1910," published by the Office of "The 
Publishers' Weekly," is undergoing a thorough revision 
for insertion in the Annual covering 1911, to be published 
early in March. The original list contains about 1100 
names and addresses of bookbuyers, with mention of 
the specialties each collector is interested in. It was the 
first attempt to gather together such a directory since 
G. Hedeler, of Leipzig, printed his list of buyers in the 
United States and Canada fourteen years ago. It has 
been helpful in promoting fraternal interests among 
collectors and in putting them in touch with others of 
similar tastes. The revision will include additional 
names, making the total number about 1500, arranged 
geographically by states as before. Data for the forth- 
coming revision will be welcomed if supplied before 
January 15, 1912. 

The " New Grant White Shakespeare," embodying 
the ripest American scholarship and latest Shakespear- 
ean study, is now announced for publication by Messrs. 
Little, Brown & Co., after years of careful preparation. 
While preserving White's text in the main, the new work 
will contain such changes in the light of the investiga- 
tions and opinions of modern and recent editors from 
the Cambridge edition to Furness as seem desirable 
in order to give in this edition the best available Shake- 
speare text up to the present time. The editors are 
Messrs. William P. Trent, M. A., Benjamin Wells, Ph.D., 
and John B. Henneman, Ph.D., who have revised, sup- 
plemented, and annotated this edition. The set, com- 
prising eighteen octavo volumes, will include nearly one 
hundred pictures by eminent artists, collected by Messrs. 
Goupil of Paris, and supplemented by sixty-nine addi- 
tional plates, comprising pictures of well-known actors 
and actresses in Shakespearean roles. There will also 
be facsimiles of title-pages of the original quartos and 
of the four folios.

author, one of those whom the Nobel Prize judges rank among the men contributing most freely to 






the advance of modern philosophy. Cloth, 800, $2.50 net ; by mail, < * 1 J.<i".

RA W MATERIAL. 

" We are going to write about it all," says 
Mr. H. G. Wells in his recent remarks about 
the contemporary novel. " We are going to 
write about business and finance and politics, 
and precedence and pretentiousness and de- 
corum and indecorum, until a thousand pre- 
tences and ten thousand impostures shrivel in 
the cold clear air of our elucidations." Mr. 
Wells, having qualified himself by both obser- 
vation and experience, has written about a good 
deal of it already, and his industry is such that 
he seems quite capable of completing the job 
before he lays down his pen or perhaps we 
should say, before his fingers cease from thump- 
ing the keys of his writing-machine. He and 
his fellow-workers have certainly set about the 
business in thoroughgoing fashion, having not 
only written about pretty nearly everything, but 
having also contrived to jar the pedestal upon 
which many an old-fashioned notion of justice 
and morality has seemed to stand secure. We 
do not think that these associated iconoclasts 
have really smashed many images, but they have 
stirred up a great intellectual rumpus, and they 
have found a half -educated public ready to ap- 
plaud their efforts. 

This is all very well in a way, because activity 
is always better than sluggishness in matters of 
the intellect, and no one will claim that the whole 
of social truth has been sorted out and packed 
and labelled. But it is rather amusing to note 
the sort of following that gathers about our 
preachers of new gospels. The young men and 
women, unbalanced for lack of reflection and 
uninformed for lack of serious educational ap- 
plication, who rally around the new standard 
bearers, do not greatly impress the judicious 
observer, because they are so evidently without 
poise or background. They have not in their 
hands the touchstones of criticism, whether for 
ideas or the expression of ideas ; and one may 
shrewdly suspect that they would not know 
how to use them if they had. They get into a 
state of great excitement about some modern 
writer who deals with a vital subject in a third- 
class way, whereas if they were really acquainted 
with literature they would know that the same 
subject had been dealt with in a first-class way 
long before. So they naively go their way, un- 
earthing mare's nests and cygnifying geese, all

the while accompanying their discoveries with 
gleeful shouts and the deliverance of cocksure 
judgments. And their most fervent applause 
goes to the writer whose defiance is expressed 
in the spirit of the naughty youngster whose 

44 1 disbelieve wholly in everything. There ! " 
broke up a certain " session of the poets." 

These young disciples of a new dispensation 
seem to believe that their popular prophets are 
for the first time bringing literature into its own. 
This is being done by letting down the bars of 
reticence on all sides, and by noisily disputing 
the validity of all hitherto accepted beliefs. Now 
reticence may possibly go too far, but no sane 
person can deny that there are ugly things in 
life that had better be kept in the dark corners 
of consciousness. If they are to be given light 
and air at all, it must be under the control of 
a severe artistic discipline, and not under the 
impulse of a desire for sensational exploitation. 
An ugly subject is involved in the stories of 
(Edipus, and Beatrice Cenci, and Siegmund 
and Sieglinde ; but it becomes beautiful without 
offence in the glorious art of Sophocles and 
Shelley and Wagner. It is the manner and 
not the matter that counts, and the world has 
taken a long stride toward decency and fitness in 
its repudiation of the grosser manner of treat- 
ment which found popular favor not so many 
generations ago. Again, it may be that some of 
the moral judgments of the world need revising, 
but it must not be forgotten that there is an 
immense presumption in favor of the conclusions 
to which accumulated experience has led, and 
that the wisdom of the ages is not lightly to be 
upset. The case for conservatism is not based 
upon unreasoning prejudice, but partly upon 
this presumption, and partly upon the instinct 
which warns the wise that, however strong may 
appear the argument for some radical innova- 
tion, there are sure to come in its train unfore- 
seen and incalculable consequences which may 
put its advocates to confusion after the mischief 
is done. 

We published not long ago an essay by one 
of our most valued contributors upon the fight 
for free raw materials in literature. It was a 
sober statement of the rightful claim of litera- 
ture to deal with all subjects of vital human 
concern, implying, of course, that the treat- 
ment should be informed and responsible. As 
far as it found fault with existing conditions, it 
did so because prudery and hypocrisy seem to 
impede the free motion of the creative spirit, and 
the rule of " pedants and pedagogues" to be too 
much in evidence. Among other consequences, 



it impelled one novelist to wonder why a recent 
book of his a singularly revolting performance 
which he asserted to contain more "raw ma- 
terial" than any other book written in America, 
had received no attention in this journal. Tin- 
assertion is fully lx>rne out by the contents of 
the book in question, and it is precisely because 
its material was still "raw" when offered to 
the public that we did not deem it deserving of 
notice. The last thing our essayist would have 
claimed would be that because literature <! 
mands a free supply of " raw materials " it should 
dump them upon the market in that form, et 
that it is absolved from all artistic responsibility 
for their shaping. The essay was not a plea for 
license, or for slackness of workmanship, or for 
anything but freedom from the limitations upon 
choice of theme which, it may freely be admitted, 
hemmed in somewhat t<x> closely the Knglish 
writers of the Victorian period. It is one thing 
to take this position, and quite another to con- 
done the course which in the case of continental 
literature has of recent years borne such evil 
fruits. The fight for free raw material will go 
on, if it be not already won; but with it will 
go on the fight for restraint, and decency, and 
artistic form in literature, and in the life which 
literature at once reflects and moulds, the fight 
for the principle that hot individual desire does 
not provide the sole test of conduct, and has no 
claims that are paramount to those of the social 
body whereof each individual is a member. 



THE SPLENDID YEARS OF MODERN 
LITERATURE. 

Criticism is in the main a discovery of the known, 
an exploration of the familiar. The contours, the 
comparative heights, the water-sheds of literary crea- 
tion and thought are in a state of apparent change. 
Each generation fixes them to suit itself ; but new 
geodetic surveys are always needed. But every sur- 
veyor's report swarms with errors. Literary work, 
once done, is certain enough in itself, but opinion 
about it varies. It is like a cloud trying to form a 
judgment in regard to the solid earth. Nevertheless, 
the attempt to fix the true relations of the eminences 
and valleys of human creation must go on. Hardly 
anything is more important for us than to know what 
in the literature of the past we ought most to admire 
and emulate. 

What is the most important body of literature 
produced in modern times? National prejudices, 
class feelings, the interests and passions of mankind. 
becloud such an inquiry. One can only offer an 
opinion and an argument. To me it seems that 
setting aside Goethe, who was a world in himself 



1912.] 



THE DIAL 



41 



the work done by the generation which gave the 
Romantic revival to England surpasses anything 
that has been done anywhere else during the last 
two hundred years. 

The English eighteenth- century literature, won- 
derful as it is in variety and human compass, is dis- 
tinctly on a lower plane. In effectiveness, the work 
of the Encyclopaedists in France was perhaps as great ; 
but the torches of Voltaire, Rousseau, and Diderot 
were blown out by the blaze they kindled. Few of 
their books have intrinsic permanent value. The 
great French outburst of 1830 was measurably a 
replica of the preceding English one, to which it was 
inferior in splendor and genetic power. Chateau- 
briand and Lamartine inherit from Byron. Hugo 
and Dumas hold from Scott. Swinburne called 
Musset Byron's attendant dwarf : perhaps it would 
be fairer to say that he is Shakespeare's page. 
Russian literature, built up during the last century, 
is wanting in light and distinction ; it is a literature 
without fresh air. To an outsider, at least, it seems 
like a confused and dreary struggle in the dark 
the tumult of men in a prison from which they 
cannot escape. The literature of the Scandinavian 
peoples sounds a good deal like the shrieks of men 
undergoing torture. In Italy, Manzoni was of the 
blood of Scott and Byron ; and while Leopardi is 
unique, he is not large enough to weigh down the 
scales against the Englishmen. Our American lit- 
erature, except for the work of one or two poets, is 
too tame and secondary to come into comparison. 
And recent English literature seems to see life as 
through a telescope reversed; everything is small 
or blurred. Tennyson is the idyllist, a maker of 
small though perfect things. Carlyle in the com- 
pany of the great Georgians would almost show like 
Thersites in the Grecian camp, or like the lame 
Vulcan on Olympus. Altogether it is hard to see 
anywhere such a company of proud and peculiar 
presences, such a senate of intellect, as appeared 
in England about the beginning of the nineteenth 
century. 

It really began with Burns : for though he belongs 
to the eighteenth century by his satire and didactic 
turn, he sounded pretty nearly all the notes of the 
new era its rebellion, its romance, its personal 
passion. He is more like Goethe than any other 
modern, and as far as he goes he is quite as great. 
Goethe's most characteristic qualities intense nat- 
uralness and undeviating truth are more than 
matched by the author of the Scotch songs, " Tarn 
O'Shanter " and "The Jolly Beggars." 

Wordsworth is surely the modern king of the spir- 
itual world. He dwelt in a region beyond the ken of 
most poets a place of high tranquillity where the 
bird of peace sits brooding on the calmed wave. 
The poet of nature yes, but his nature is not the 
catalogue of outward things which even great poets 
give ; it is the verity to which man is only an inci- 
dent; it is the melting-pot of generations; it is the 
very body of the Eternal himself. 

Coleridge, though he gave a good part of his mind 



to the making of Wordsworth, is not spiritual. He 
is the lord of the supersensuous, of that unreal world 
of glamor and dream image which is the most real 
thing in existence for the liner sort of minds. It 
was his poetry and criticism that really broke the 
eighteenth century's cast-iron system of common 
sense, made explicable the great poetry of the past, 
and gave the new men the keys to that domain. 

There are two great divisions among writers 
those who speak for themselves, and those through 
whom others speak, in other words, the lyric and 
the dramatic types. Largely this era was a lyric 
one, an era of great personalities who swept the 
world with their passion or their grief. But it had 
its supreme creative artist in Scott, who was ob- 
jective even in his poetry. It is an Arab supersti- 
tion that he who draws or paints the picture of a 
human being must on the Last Day furnish it with 
a soul to be condemned or rewarded. What an 
expense Scott would be in that case! And amid 
the cohorts of the man-created, what a vast and 
predominant array would owe allegiance to him ! 

Byron was the dynamo of his generation the 
most splendid figure, the greatest force, English 
literature has produced. Like Tamburlane holloa- 
ing to the harnessed Kings of Asia, Byron could 
boast of driving the intellect of Europe in leash. 
His influence extended everywhere, from Russia to 
the two Americas. His world was the world of 
passion and politics and affairs, but in this world 
his books were events comparable with the French 
Revolution or the campaigns of Napoleon. And 
his track is not yet a faded one. The richness and 
splendor of his literary gifts will keep his works 
alive when those of Voltaire and Rousseau are 
comparatively forgotten. 

Shelley was the prophet of his time, a Memnon 
of to-morrow. It only needs a glance at contempo- 
rary literature and life to see how much his spirit 
is awake. The seed ideas that he flung about have 
taken root, are growing on every side. In a literary 
way, he brought into the world a haunting strain of 
music, new and perfect, which must live on even if 
his ideas and policies wither away. 

All these men were something more than writers, 
but Keats was literature incarnate the pure artist 
living for image and expression. Borrowing from the 
best of his predecessors, he attained such mastery of 
language that he set his s,&mp upon two generations 
of his followers, as Pope did on two generations of 
his. Perhaps such richly floriated work has been 
overdone : there is need to recur to the granite 
foundation-stuff of thought and feeling. But in 
Keats's mature work there is no weakness. Large- 
ness and loveliness were never more perfectly welded 
together. 

These were the stars of first magnitude in that 
English constellation. It speaks volumes for their 
brilliancy when an orb like Landor could roll by un- 
attached, unnoticed ; when the novel world of Miss 
Austen could spring into being in their midst with- 
out attracting attention. There is enough good read-

ing in Landor to give us measureless content ; Miss 
Austen is surely the equal of any English novelist, 
excepting Dickens, since her day ; yet when we 
think of them in connection with the Georgian group, 
neither of them looms large. 

And the satellites of this system were mighty and 
self-shining lights. There was Moore, a true and 
tender lyrist who knew better than most of them 
how to make a song. There was Campbell, whose 
resonant verse expressed a nation's exultation as it 
has never been done before or since. There were 
Hazlitt, Lamb, Leigh Hunt, DeQuincey, and Wilson, 
essayists who as a group can hardly be matched 
in literature. There were writers of single remark- 
able books Godwin, Beckford, Mrs. Shelley. All 
told, the display was dazzling. 

It was preeminently an age of poets. Prose has 
been winning on poetry in every language in mod- 
ern times. The greatest triumphs of the men of 
1830 in France were prose triumphs ; and the same 
may fairly be said of the Victorian writers. But 
in the English Romantic revival, poetry made its 
last great stand for supremacy. The verse of Burns 
and Scott and Byron swept the world. For a time, 
prose was in eclipse. Now, putting aside any other 
element of superiority, the concentration of verse 
gives it a far greater chance of immortality than 
prose possesses. Verse is to prose as diamonds are 
to dust. It lasts longer, and value is more easily 
portable in it. As books accumulate in incredible 
numbers, it looks as if the race would have to throw 
away all but the most concentrated and quintessen- 
tial records of its experience. Time will do what 
the Caliph Omar did to winnow our libraries. But 
poetry takes up comparatively little space, and it is 
easily remembered. 

The Georgian era was an era of youth. Nearly 
all its writers did their great work early, and the 
majority of them died young. The personalities 
and actions of the young are certainly more attract- 
ive to mankind than those that pertain to mature 
humanity. Balzac may discover the middle-aged 
heroine, but she will never displace the Juliets and 
Gretchens in the affection of the world. 

Again, the Georgians were a race of divine ama- 
teurs. Among the chiefs, Scott was the only pro- 
fessional author the only one who deliberately 
wrote for money. Schopenhauer said that the ruin 
of literature came about when men found that they 
could make money by books. A great part of mod- 
ern literature reads as if it was written to provide 
frocks for the authors' wives. Those who work 
with such ulterior motive must keep a wary eye on 
the market; they must cog and flatter and palter. 
The Georgians wrote in scorn of consequence. 
They could play at pitch-and-toss with the universe. 
They could dare everything. 

All in all, then, I think it is tolerably certain that 
the Georgian outburst was the most important ap- 
parition of literary genius that the world has seen 
in modern times. No single figure of its group 
is equal to Shakespeare or Milton or Moliere or 



Goethe. But in the mats they surpass any but the 
greatest of those. Vast and various a* the world's 
literature has become -inn-. I doubt if taken to- 
gether it is equal in value to the work of those few 
yean in one country. For one thing, recent litera- 
ture ha<i taken a turn downward. It IKIS largely 
exchanged verse for prose ; it has mingled with the 
crowd on the levels, instead of staying with the 
shining ones on the hills; it has dealt very exclu- 
sively with the passive peculiarities of women, 
rather than with the active energies of men. If we 
are going to have a great literature again, it seems 
to me that we must think a great deal on the 

Georgian epoch.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



THE SUDDEN DEATH OF ALFRED TENNYSON 

DICKENS, senior surviving member of the great nov- 
elist's family, and godson of the late poet-laureate, 
adds one more to the list of unfortunate occurrences 
in connection with the celebration, already begun, of 
the Dickens centenary year. Mr. Snowden Ward, 
who was to have lectured on the novelist, has been 
removed by death ; the much-advertised Dickens 
stamp failed to make itself a- popular as had been 
hoped ; and now he who was to have played a lead- 
ing part in the centennial festivities has been ab- 
ruptly stricken down while lecturing in this country 
on his father's life and works. The sad event is 
the more to be regretted because, had Mr. Dickens 
lived even a little longer, he would have learned with 
satisfaction of the action now being taken by a num- 
ber of wealthy Americans, headed by Mr. Henry 
Clews, the banker, to raise a fund in honor of Charles 
Dickens and for the aid of those of his descendants 
to whom such aid is likely to be welcome. Mr. 
Dickens had been in America since last September, 
visiting different cities and addressing interested 
audiences on the unfailingly popular subject, Charles 
Dickens the man and the writer. 


THE INTERESTING OUTCOME OF A PUBLISHING 

DISPUTE reaches us from Paris. Some time ago 
comment was made in these columns on M. Anatole 
France's very natural objection to the publication 
of a French history which he had written twenty- 
seven years before as a piece of hack-work, and which 
had apparently not seemed to the publisher worth 
printing until its author's increasing fame gave it a 
factitious value. Unwilling to have his name at- 
tached to a crude and immature performance, the 
writer invoked the aid of the law to prevent it. His 
counsel, M. Raymond Poincare*, consulted the his- 
torian Lavisse in the matter, and Professor Lavisse 
expressed himself in no uncertain terms. " It is not 
to be permitted," he said, " that a historian should 
be forced to publish a history written by liim twenty- 
seven years ago. In so long a period the world has 
changed, the historian likewise." After dwelling 



1912.]

43 



on the ripening effect of time and experience on any 
author, he cited the instance of Duruy, the historian 
of Rome, whose first two volumes, written before his 
ministry of state, are markedly inferior in richness 
and power to the subsequent volumes that were writ- 
ten after those years of public life and of history- 
making in his own person. The compromise finally 
proposed by the publisher of the work now under dis- 
cussion was that, the date of writing should appear 
on the first page of the book, to which the party of 
the other part consented on condition that the cover 
should bear the further inscription, "Published 
against the will of M. Anatole France." The pub- 
lisher not relishing this undesirable form of advertis- 
ing, the matter was left to the court's decision, which 
was given in favor of the author, the publisher being 
ordered to return the MS. and cancel the contract. 

LAST YEAR'S LIST OF DEAD AUTHORS includes the 
names of Antonio Fogazzaro, a novelist of world- 
wide fame; William S. Gilbert, known to every 
lover of the mirthful in printed verse and in acted 
opera of the lighter sort ; Thomas Wentworth 
Higginson, one of the last survivors of that honored 
company of authors who made New England cele- 
brated in letters ; Charles Battell Loomis, master of 
a wholesome humor that many right-minded readers 
enjoyed ; David Graham Phillips, who achieved 
much popularity and some distinction as a novelist; 
Francis A. March, one of the most learned of philol- 
ogists, who wrote in a way to interest even the 
unlearned ; Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward, who 
knew how to point a moral and at the same time 
tell a love-story ; Eugene F. Ware, who achieved na- 
tional fame as " Ironquill "; Katherine C. Thurston, 
who wrote at least one novel that was widely read 
and discussed on two continents ; Myrtle Reed, 
whose books gained many thousands of appreciative 
readers ; and, last in date of decease, John Bigelow, 
the earliest born and among the foremost in influ- 
ence and power. . . . 

SCHOOLS OF PRINTING IN THE UNITED STATES 
are a rapidly developing feature of industrial edu- 
cation. A few weeks ago Mr. John Cotton Dana, 
in an address introducing the second course of lec- 
tures at the Harvard Graduate School of Business 
Administration, ran over the list of such schools, so 
far as he had been able to gather the necessary 
information. He enumerated, in addition to the 
Harvard School, the Inland Printer Technical 
School in Chicago, under direction of the Interna- 
tional Typographical Union Commission on Supple- 
mental Trade Education ; the courses in connection 
with the School of Journalism at the State Uni- 
versity of Washington; the instruction in printing 
at the United States Indian School, Carlisle, Pa.; 
the North End Union School of Printing, Boston ; 
the New York Trade School, at 67th St. and First 
Ave., New York ; the Empire Mergenthaler Lino- 
type School, 419 First Ave., New York ; the Colum- 



bus Trade School, Columbus, 0.; the Cleveland 
Elementary Industrial School, Cleveland, O. He 
omitted those industrial schools for negroes which 
give practical instruction in printing ; at Tuskegee, 
for instance, and at the Utica Normal and Industrial 
Institute, Utica, Miss., the students print the monthly 
papers of their schools, after the necessary teaching 
and practice. ... 

THE COONSKIN LIBRARY, which came into being 
one hundred and eight years ago, in Ames Township, 
Athens County, Ohio, claims no relationship with 
the Pigskin Library of a century later. Miss Mary 
E. Downey, library-organizer of Ohio, in her late 
address before the Federation of Women's Clubs of 
that state, an address now issued in pamphlet form 
by the Ohio Board of Library Commissioners, re- 
lates the history of the Coonskin Library. Athens 
County saw but little ready money in the early nine* 
teenth century ; but the woods were full of animals 
clothed in valuable furs, and when one Samuel Brown 
made a business trip to Boston he took a wagon- 
load of skins and traded them for books, obtaining 
fifty-one volumes for the peltry. When the Western 
Library Association of Ames Township was organ- 
ized, in 1804, a certain Thomas Ewing, apparently 
inspired by this experience of Samuel Brown's, con- 
tributed ten coonskins, his entire wealth ; whence 
the name 4< Coonskin Library." He says of it later: 
" It was well selected ; the library of the Vatican 
was nothing to it, and there never was a library 
better read." In 1816 the collection suffered some 
disintegration, a part of it going to Dover upon the 
formation of the Dover Library Association. Some 
of the books were given to the Athens Pioneer Asso- 
ciation, others were sold to William P. Cutler of 
Washington County, and still others, in 1876, were 
sent to the Centennial at Philadelphia and were 
never returned. ... 

A DICKENS CENTENARY FUND is being raised 
by the London " Daily Telegraph," the much- 
discussed Dickens stamp having failed to yield the 
revenue hoped for by the would-be benefactors of 
the novelist's five grandchildren who are said to be 
in not exactly opulent circumstances. The first 
week's subscriptions to the fund are reported as 
amounting to a little more than two thousand pounds. 
Those publishers who have enriched themselves 
from the sales of the immortal novels are said to be 
conspicuous by their absence from the company 
of subscribers. Authors, on the other hand, and 
especially novelists, have generously responded, the 
considerable givers including Mrs. Humphry Ward, 
Mr. Rudyard Kipling, and Miss Marie Corelli. 
"Next to Shakespeare and Keats," says Miss Corelli, 
" Dickens has ever been my closest author-friend."

the English literature department. It is hoped to 
enlist about thirty students, and preparation for the 
summer's work will go on during the winter, and 
will consist of study of English topography and of 
English literary history, with attention to the prob- 
lems of literary technique. The special study to he 
taken up by these vacationists abroad will be " The 
Background and Environment, Physical and Human, 
of Modern English Literature." Similar courses of 
styudy have already been engaged in by university 
classes in Greece, Rome, and Palestine; and the field 
work is to be modelled after the excursions conducted 
by the departments of geology and botany. Some- 
thing unobtainable in the library and the study 
will doubtlessly be gained by these field-workers. 
Whether it will bring a richer enjoyment and a 
fuller understanding of English literature than the 
stay-at-home can acquire in his arm-chair will of 
course depend largely on the individual student. 



AERONAUTIC FICTION FOR YOUNG READERS is 
already considerable in quantity, and likely to in- 
crease rapidly, though the airship novel for adults 
has not yet made itself conspicuous. Among juve- 
nile books in this class may be noted Mr. Harry

THE POST-OFFICE SALE OF MISDIRECTED BOOKS, 

which formed no inconsiderable part of the ten thou- 
sand dollars' worth of miscellaneous articles disposed 
of by auction in last year's clearance sale of postal 
matter of unaacertainable ownership, amounted to 
one thousand two hundred and twenty-two pack- 
ages. Nearly every language spoken in our broad 
land was represented in the collection, which in- 
cluded, as a special curiosity, a Choctaw version of 
the Book of Psalms. In the entire lot Bibles and 
books on religious topics predominated. If more 
than a thousand books were misdirected, how many 
thousands, or perhaps hundreds of thousands, must 
have been carried by the mails ! And how many 
times that number would be thus carried every 
year if we had, what many another country has, a 
thorough-going parcels-post system !

AN EARLY BROWNING CENTENARY CELEBRATION 
seems already to have been held in Boston, where 
the local Browning Society, at its regular meeting 



in December, li-tened to talks on the poet and hi* 
works and examined a tine cullt'ction of tir>t edition* 
of the poems, brought from tin- i'.n.u nin^ alcove of 
the Boston Public Library for the occasion. This col- 
lection is Paid to be the most nearly complete of any 
in the world, lacking only one item, tin- Paul 
Browning's tir.-t pu!>li>hc<l work. Tlii> volume, as 
it chance**, the Boston Browning Society once had an 
opportunity to buy for one Immlrecl and fifty dollars, 
but let the golden opportunity slip; and now t la- 
same stodgy -looking little book commands nearly ten 
times that amount. This interesting meeting devoted 
its attention largely to the coming centenary of 
Browning's birth, in May.

FACSIMILES OF EARLY ENGLISH TEXTS. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

May I ask your good offices to communicate to the 
members of the Modern Language Association, and 
others interested, some information which arrived just 
too late to be reported at the recent meeting of the 
Association at Chicago? Professor Gollancz writes that 
arrangements have been made, through the generosity 
of a private donor, for the publication of the facsimile 
of the Caedmon MS. by the Oxford University Press 
for the British Academy, to commemorate the tercen- 
tenary of the Authorized Version of the Bible. It is 
expected that the facsimile will be issued early next 
year, and it is understood that the rights of American 
subscribers are to be safeguarded; '.., subscribers under 
the last scheme will not be obliged to accept this repro- 
duction, but will have the privilege of renewing their 
subscriptions at the same price, five guineas. The ordi- 
nary published price will not be less than six guinea*. 
Any other member of the Modern Language Association 
of America who subscribes through the undersigned 
before the date of publication is to have a copy at the 
lower price. Professor Gollancz writes that the Early 
English Text Society has now ready facsimiles of 
"Cotton Nero Ax" (containing "Pearl," "Cleanness," 
" Patience," and " Sir Gawayne "), the first issue of the 
series to commemorate the lamented founder and direc- 
tor of the Society, Mr. Furnivall. The first volume will 
be limited to 250 copies, and the published price will be 
three guineas; members of the Modern Language Asso- 
ciation who subscribe through the undersigned before 
March 1 are to have the volume at 12. 5s. The repro- 
duction contains the illustrations as well as the texts, 
and is of the same size aa the MS. In addition to the 
issue of the whole MS.. l."io copies of "Pearl," each 
page printed on a separate sheet, have been prepared. 
The price of this volume, or rather portfolio, will be 
25 shillings. Subscribers before publication, who are 
members of the Modern Language Association, may ob- 
tain the " Pearl " facsimile for one guinea by ordering 
through the undersigned. No money is to be sent to 
me, merely the formal order for the facsimile desired.

A SOLDIER'S MEMORIES AND REFLECTIONS.* 



General Miles's book, "Serving the Repub- 
lic," though covering much of the ground gone 
over in his " Personal Recollections and Observa- 
tions of the Civil War and Indian Campaigns," 
published five years ago, brings in so many new 
and interesting details, and also contains so ex- 
cellent though brief an account of the Spanish- 
American War and his own important albeit 
unspectacular part therein, as to entitle it to a 
place beside such military memoirs as Grant's, 
Sherman's, Sheridan's and Howard's. Cam- 
paigns and battles participated in by him are 
described with soldierly directness and brevity, 
but not without those occasional turns of expres- 
sion necessary to impart vividness and pictur- 
esqueness to the narrative. 

Proud of his New England birth and upbring- 
ing, General Miles regards his birthplace ( West- 
minster, Mass.) as the one best place in the 
world to be born in. " No more ideal setting 
for innocent and happy childhood," he declares, 
" could be found than my home, the recollection 
of which I naturally cherish, and my happiest 
memories are of that period of my life and the 
pleasures, influences, and associations that it 
held." The active sports of a country lad, such 
as riding, swimming, skating, coasting, ball- 
playing, hunting and trapping, were engaged in 
with hearty zest, while the more contemplative 
pleasures of nature- study also gave him whole- 
some enjoyment and helped to lay the founda- 
tions of a physical constitution that afterward 
carried him through the hardships of military 
service. Averse to the studious confinement of 
a college course, the young man supplemented 
his high-school education with a few years of 
commercial experience in Boston ; and when the 
call to arms came in 1861 he found himself, by 
his early readings and ambitions, irresistibly 
impelled to take part in the impending conflict. 
Curiously enough in the light of subsequent 
events, he was destined at the very outset to en- 
counter petty and irksome hindrance of a polit- 
ical nature. After spending all the money he 
possessed, and twenty-five hundred dollars that 
he had borrowed, in raising and equipping a 
company, and after being chosen captain of the 
company and duly appointed by the governor, 
political pressure was brought to bear at the 

*SERVING THE REPUBLIC. Memoirs of the Civil and 
Military Life of Nelson A. Miles, Lieutenant-General, United 
States Army. Illustrated. New York : Harper & Brothers. 



State house and the commission was revoked. 
" As I had enlisted to serve my country and 
not for a war with the Governor of my State," 
tersely writes the object of this affront, " I re- 
luctantly returned the commission upon which 
I had been sworn into the service of the general 
government and accepted the commission of 
First Lieutenant of Company E, 22d Massachu- 
setts Infantry." 

Joining Wadsworth's brigade of FitzJohn 
Porter's division, the young lieutenant continued 
with the Army of the Potomac, and rapidly rose, 
through successive promotions for gallantry and 
efficiency, to the office of brigadier-general of 
volunteers in the spring of 1864, when he was 
not yet twenty-five, and of major-general of vol- 
unteers in October of the following year. His 
brigadier-generalship in the regular army came 
in 1880, his major-generalship in 1890, and his 
attainment to his present rank in 1900. Par- 
ticipating in many of the bloodiest battles of the 
war, General Miles was several times wounded, 
once so severely as to incapacitate him for active 
service just when he was most eager to act in 
the summer of the Gettysburg fight. A short 
passage from the writer's account of Antietam 
will serve to show of what stuff the young 
officer was made. 

" Our brigade moved on to the field in the second 
line. After the first brigade had become engaged we 
were called into action and succeeded in turning the 
right flank of the corps opposed to us, breaking the line 
and then wheeling to the right and enfilading what is 
known as the Bloody Lane. Our regiment charged the 
enemy occupying that position, and succeeded in captur- 
ing it with over two hundred prisoners and a stand of 
colors. After the engagement, this sunken road pre- 
sented one of the most horrible scenes of the war. It 
was practically filled with dead and wounded, while 
the ground in front and rear was strewn with bodies of 
men engaged on both sides. It was here that Colonel 
Francis C. Barlow, a fearless and accomplished officer, 
was severely wounded and carried from the field, leav- 
ing me in command of the regiment, my first experience 
as a field officer under fire. However, my first order 
was to advance, and from the Bloody Lane we drove the 
enemy through the cornfield and orchard, and remained 
there, with nothing on our right or left, until ordered 
back to a line occupied by the other troops." 

The author's campaigns against the Indians of 
the Northwest fill several chapters of his book, 
and are followed by observations on " Indian 
Life and Problems," with a reprint of his " North 
American Review " article entitled "The Indian 
Problem . ' ' From the account of operations lead- 
ing up to the capture of the redoubtable Chief 
Joseph, of the Nez Perces, we quote a stirring 
passage. 

" We were early on the march, September 30th, and 
soon one of our Indians came dashing back, reporting

the discovery of the Indian camp. Without a halt <>nr 
troops formed line of battle, each trooper st-ruml his 
cartridge belt, and, with carbine or riHe in hand, galloped 
forward prepared for action. A more spirited, resolute 
body of men I have never Been go into battle. Every 
nerve and fiber seemed to be animated, and every eye 
sparkled with fire. The transformation of our Indian 
allies was spectacular and almost instantaneous. The 
old horses and mules they were riding were rushed into 
a ravine; their old hats, clothing, and useless parapher- 
nalia were cached; their strong, fresh war ponies, with 
a rawhide lariat around the necks and under jaws, but 
without saddles or bridles, were quickly mounted. In 
full war paint, with gorgeously feathered and beaded 
war bonnets, buckskin girdles about the loins, moccasins, 
and rifles and cartridge belts, the warriors were fully 
equipped for the fray, as gamy a looking body of sav- 
ages as could be imagined." 

Three pithy chapters, "The War with Spain," 
44 Campaigning in Cuba/' and "The Capture of 
Porto Rico," give the significant facts of our late 
inglorious conflict, which, even in the opinion of 
this military author, so far as it can be inferred 
from his discreetly reticent pages, might easily 
have been avoided and its ultimate objects at- 
tained by peaceable means. But, as he remarks, 
44 the advocacy of certain of the press journals, 
as well as the clamor of a portion of our people, 
continued until the war frenzy predominated." 
The retention of the commanding general in this 
country while his subordinates were sent forth 
to win glory at San Juan and elsewhere, we 
find recorded with characteristic brevity by the 
author ; but in closing his narrative of those 
final movements of his in person which resulted 
in the Spanish surrender at Santiago and in the 
bloodless capture of Porto Rico, he does venture 
on something like criticism, implied rather than 
direct, of our government's policy. He says : 

" I shall always regret that I did not go immediately 
to the Philippine Islands, as I have always believed that 
from my experience in other campaigns, and with other 
people under similar conditions I could have prevented 
any serious controversy and certainly hostilities between 
the military forces of the United States and the millions 
of people of the archipelago. The people of the Philip- 
pine Islands had suffered the oppression of foreign rule 
for three hundred years, and were entitled to the sym- 
pathy of the world. With heroic efforts they had con- 
tended against their oppressors ; they had produced 
statesmen and patriots of the highest order. Such men 
as Jose" Rizal and Mabine will ever render the history 
of their race immortal. They had formed a government 
and framed a constitution copied after our own." 

The author ends his book with the close of 
his active service in 1903. It is the narrative 
of a man of action, passing rapidly from event 
to event, and written in a manner so unostenta- 
tiously effective that one is hardly conscious 
of its excellence until occasionally the writer 
pauses to indulge in some reflection or general- 



i/ation less happily suited to his genius than the 
straightforward record of campaigns and battles. 
To the attainment of accuracy in this record he 
has, as he says in his preface, devotee! his earn- 
est efforts, in order that what he writes may be 
at least authentic. And so his book is not only 
very readable and confidence- inspiring history 
in itself, but also a source from which future 
writers will draw in compiling the history of our 
time. Its illustrations include some excellent 
drawings by Mr. Howard Chandler Christy 
and Mr. T. de Thulstrup, with many portraits. 
Maps of Porto Rico and of Western United 
States are given ; also appended matter consist- 
ing of the author's 44 North American Review " 
article on " Our Unwatered Empire," and his 
congratulatory General Order to the army from 
Siboney after the Spanish surrender. A ten- 
page index closes the book.

THE THREE EGYPTS.* 

The three books now before the reviewer carry 
him back to an instructive series of encounters 
on the Nile. The flies were thick at Luxor, the 
gently moving dust was persistently penetrative, 
and the sun was most glaring, when two of our 
fellow countrymen entered the office of Thoma> 
Cook abhorred of Pierre Loti, but blessed by 
countless thousands. 44 You better get it fixed 
so we can start back to Cairo tonight, or they 
will make us go on to Assouan." The words 
were simple, but as they issued from the stout 
gentleman's thick red lips they conveyed utter 
weariness of temples and tombs, supreme con- 
tempt for the alleged glories of Egyptian archi- 
tecture and sunsets on the Nile, and a regular 
seventeen-seventy-six declaration that henceforth 
he would live his own life and be bullied no 
longer into feigned enjoyment of dead Pharaohs, 
naked fellaheen, and creaking sakiyehs. So he 
escaped from the trip to Assouan, even as from 
the shadow of death, and returned to Cairo, 
where we found him two weeks later. He was 
perfectly happy. The mixed throngs, the bustle 
and stir, the very exactions of the 44 swell " hotels, 
made him thrill with joy. 44 Great town this,"

he kept repeating. " You get the real Egypt 
here!" All he had seen was the Street of the 
Camel, and the notorious quarters not far away. 
He had confused tinsel and bright dyes with 
genuine oriental color, and had managed to 
transform a shifting, picturesque, mongrel mob 
into the embodiment of cosmopolitanism. But 
the old Egypt of the Pharaohs and their succes- 
sors had only bored him; Arabic Egypt, still to 
be found in a few villages or in some parts of 
Cairo away from the tourist-crowded thorough- 
fares, had never been revealed to him ; and 
modern Egypt escaped him altogether, for he 
had no preliminary knowledge either of the eco- 
nomic, industrial, and administrative problems 
of the country, or of the aspirations and activities 
of the Nationalist party. 

The earliest of the three Egypts our tourist 
might have enjoyed is represented by the first 
volume in our present list, which is a translation 
of six articles appearing originally in the Revue 
de Paris. It gives "a popular account of the 
interesting but complicated problems raised by 
the discoveries of the last ten or fifteen years," 
and inasmuch as it is written by a competent 
specialist, it represents the only sort of popu- 
larizing that should be tolerated on a subject 
within the field of serious scholarship. Through- 
out three hundred pages the reader follows a 
delightful guide who has a right to speak, and 
each chapter proves much richer than is promised 
by its modest caption. For instance, in connec- 
tion with the " Restoration of the Egyptian Tem- 
ples " we are told not only how the structures 
are restored but how they were built and how 
they were destroyed. Indeed, the writer's simple 
explanation of the use of the inclined plane, of 
terraced embankments, and of primitive machin- 
ery, carries much more enlightenment than is 
to be gained from many more ambitious essays. 
Similarly, " Pharaonic Diplomacy " broadens 
out into administrative methods and interna- 
tional relations. So that by the time we finish 
"Egypt before the Pyramids," "The Book of the 
Dead," "Around the Pyramids," and "Magic 
in Ancient Egypt," we have been neatly intro- 
duced to many fields of Egyptology. 

Of the disputable views advanced by M. 
Moret, the most interesting is that the Pharaohs 
were not essentially tyrants exercising a ruthless 
rule over their subjects. Only a Frenchman 
could have put his theory in such attractive 
form as this: 

" In the eyes of their contemporaries, the Pharaohs 
were rather benefactors, who put great ideas into tangi- 
ble form and enabled a whole nation to conquer Para- 



dise. They could not have carried on their labours 
during several centuries and achieved such colossal re- 
sults had they not been supported by popular enthusiasm 
similar to that which, less than nine centuries ago, pro- 
moted the construction of the European cathedrals. 
The beautiful lines of Sully Prudhomme describe a 
mason who died, despised, while building the pyramid 
and crying out in vain : 

' II monte, il va, cherchant les dieux et la justice . . .' 
[He climbs, he mounts, seeking gods and justice . . .] 
Yet, this is not the complaint of a victim, it is the 
clamour of a whole primitive nation, a cry of hope, of 
fear, of will, rejoicing that a way to heaven has been 
forced open by the triangular apex of the pyramid." 

The theory is really too beautiful ; and at the 
risk of seeming presumptuous we must state 
that the evidence seems inadequate, and confess 
our adherence to a modified form of the ti'adi- 
tional theory that found expression in Herodotus 
and has been held in some form or other ever 
since. But even our moments of occasional 
disagreement are pleasurable ; and we are glad 
to praise a modest and successful presentation. 
The book is clearly printed, neatly bound, and 
helpfully illustrated. 

To our second volume, " Oriental Cairo," we 
must apply the adjective " popular " in a radi- 
cally different sense. Mr. Sladen found that Cairo 
included a glorious mediaeval city of the Arabian 
Nights, with innumerable monuments of medi- 
aeval Arab architecture and unspoiled native 
life in short, the second of our three Egypts. 
To this he strives to call attention in a book 
that he hopes to make "chatty and interesting." 
And he unquestionably succeeds; but it seems 
that he pays rather a ghastly price for his suc- 
cess. Obviously, his modest aims forbid criti- 
cism on questions of scholarship, or even of 
accuracy ; so we omit any such considerations. 
But why will a clever man be driven by his 
enthusiasm to perpetrate enormities like the fol- 
lowing : "The desert is well named. It is very 
deserted." " The head of the Sphinx the most 
subtle pieces of sculpture the world ever pro- 
duced." " The statue of Chephren, who built 
the second Pyramid of Gizeh, and has an ex- 
pression as subtle as that of Leonardo da Vinci's 
Monna Lisa." If such absurdities, together 
with countless impertinent reflections, were 
eliminated, the material reorganized with a view 
to orderly presentation, the superlatives brought 
under reasonable control, and the whole worked 
over with patient care, we should have had a 
really welcome book, such as Mr. Sladen at his 
best is easily capable of writing. Even as it is, 
we have enjoyed much of it ; and the prospec- 
tive leisurely tourist ought to enjoy more. By 
reading the book he will not only become theo-

how to enjoy the "Humors of the Esbekiya" 
and countless other entertaining features of this 
variegated modern capital. lie will even know 
the " Artist's Bits in Cairo," and will receive 
explicit directions how to find them. In other 
words, he need no longer be a " tame tourist " 
in the hands of a masterful dragoman. The book 
itself has a plump, prosperous, and pleasing air, 
eminently befitting the readable contents. 

In bis preliminary note Mr. Sladen claimed 
for his volume "the saving grace of making 
no political comment upon Egyptians"; but by 
the time of the fourth appendix he quotes with 
evident glee the text of M r. Roosevelt's " great 
speech on Egypt at the Guildhall." With 
this he brings us to our third Egypt, which 
is the real theme of Mr. Duse Mohamed's mili- 
tant volume. The author is the son of an Egyp- 
tian officer and a Nubian mother, and " since 
1884 has practically resided in England, where 
he began his education in 1876." He takes up 
his work in the present volume with " Ismail the 
Magnificent," and gives a history of Egypt, with 
a running comment, from that period to the 
present. He is a thoroughgoing Nationalist, 
and his book may be strongly recommended to 
all readers who wish to examine that side of a 
very difficult problem. Some will believe that 
Mr. Mohamed frequently weakens his own case 
by over-straining or by irrelevance. For in- 
stance, he evidently wishes to suggest that the 
murderer of Boutros Pasha was unfairly con- 
victed, because the Egyptian doctors differed 
from the English in holding that the victim died 
from the operation rather than from the wound ; 
and the much-discussed Guildhall speech of Mr. 
Roosevelt, "a globe-trotting and scribbling in- 
terloper," goads him into a virulent attack on 
the United States. This onslaught may or may 
not be deserved ; but it can scarcely be said to 
bear on the question of Egyptian Nationalism, 
nor is it likely to make friends for the cause 
either in America or England. A leading Na- 
tionalist, to whom the reviewer became deeply 
indebted while in Egypt, once stated that their 
prominent writers generally injured their cause 
before they reached the end of a book ; and he 
seems to have been right. It would really be 
an easy task to write plausibly in favor of Na- 
tionalism by appealing to the general sympathy 
felt by mankind toward the aspirations of any 
people, and by dwelling upon certain undeniable 
mistakes of the Kn^lish Controlling body, as in 
the Denshawai affair. But invariably the pub- 



lishing partisans allow their emotions to carry 
tin-in into argument* that are invalid and po.i- 
tions that are untenable. However, our author 
errs no more seriously than the majority of his 
co-workers ; and his arraignment of Great Bri- 
tain is well worth reading. One of his most 
entertaining chapters treats of " The People of 
Egypt," butev.-n In -re his opportunity to make 
converts is lost by the tendencies to which \\- 
have referred. In writing for prejudiced Kn- 
glish or Americans, and we are hopeles-ly 
prejudiced on the marriage question, an ad- 
vocate does not strengthen his case by going 
out of his way to insist that "a religious system 
which equalizes the status of several wivep, and 
which specially insists on the hushand treating 
each wife with the same kindness and consid- 
eration, by placing each wife on a basis of 
equality, makes for a higher standard of morality 
than the evidently galling monogamy of the 
West." Similarly, we are hard to convince 
that " Science is the Life of Islam," at least in 
our comprehension of the word science. The 
reviewer is not only a lover of the Orient, but 
a strong advocate of peaceful national develop- 
ment the world over, wherever it is possible; 
yet he cannot feel that the supporters of Egyp- 
tian self-government make a strong showing at 
present. However, it is to be hoped that both in 
England and America a patient and careful hear- 
ing will be given to all such genuine enthusiasts 
as the author of * In the Land of the Pharaohs." 
As a closing word, it should be urged that 
Egypt is well worth seeing and knowing. If 
the American traveller would give even a single 
intelligent month to the Nile Valley, he would 
be not less delighted than surprised at the rich- 
ness of his gleanings. In the presence of Karnak 
or Philae, or the Tombs of the Kings, he must 
not expect the rhapsodic raptures felt, or at any 
rate described, by such veteran thrillers as 
Loti or I lichens : but he may experience a gen- 
uine tugging at the heartstrings that will leave 
its effect forever. He must not look for the 
never-ending variety and brooding charm of 
the real East as found in India; but at any rate 
he will discover enough of the Orient to afford 
a vivid contrast to his own western world. And 
if one may not demand that thirty days shall 
shed final light on the vexed problem of British 
control or national self-government, one may 
see many significant indications to help toward 
an intelligent conclusion. But the implied ad- 
vice that one should read widely and studiously 
before his visit, would obviously not be needed 
here. F. B. R. MM , , M >.

BOOKS ABOUT WILD AXIMALS.* 

The strenuous life of a hunter-naturalist in 
Sub-Arctic America, among the Ogilvie and 
Selwyn Rockies and Pelly Mountains, about 
the headwaters of the rivers Macmillan, Pelly, 
and Ross, in 1904 and 1905, is related in Mr. 
Charles Sheldon's " Wilderness of the Upper 
Yukon." The work reveals a keen observer 
and skilful recorder of the animal life of the 
northern wilderness whose facile pen enlivens 
the narrative of camp routine or oft-repeated 
story of successful chase or stalk of the moun- 
tain sheep, caribou, moose, or grizzly bear, amid 
crags and snowfields above timber-line or in 
forest fastnesses. Photographs of his trophies 
magnificent bighorn rams, taken as they lay 
victims of his cunning and marksmanship 
abound in the book. The author is primarily 
a sportsman, and defends the bloody and ruth- 
less extermination of these superb animals on 
the ground of his love of nature ! 

" The hunter-sportsman is a strange combination, 
possessed by the fascination of hunting and killing the 
animals that he loves. ... I never knew a true hunter, 
be he the rough pioneer or the cultured man, who did 
not have an intense fondness for the wild animals, a 
strong interest in studying them and protecting them, 
and also a desire to alleviate and prevent their suffering; 
yet there still persists his paradoxical love of hunting 
and killing them. . . . The time may come when most 
of us will undertake to work, endure, and suffer the 
hardships of the wilderness, prompted only for love of 
it for its own sake. But to many of us, in our present 
state, hunting prevents the mere contemplative indul- 
gence in the beautiful from producing effeminateness." 

Blood is not the only, and possibly not the 
best, sustenance upon which to rear a virile 
race. The instinct of play and the love of 
nature do not, for most normal men, need the 
rifle or shotgun for their adequate expression. 
The long ranged Mannlicher and split-nosed 
bullets in the hands of sportsmen in a few 
more years will completely exterminate all the 
big game animals of the wilderness of the 
Northwest unless governmental protection shall 
effectively preserve them for the enjoyment of

later generations. The plea that the sports- 
man's bloody business is a necessary panacea 
for effeminateness in lovers of the wilderness 
and mountain heights, seems inconclusive if 
not indeed immoral. Some very illuminating 
observations are recorded in this book concern- 
ing the keenness of the power of scent and its 
dominance over vision in the controlling be- 
havior of these wild and timid creatures of the 
crags, as well as some practical and seemingly 
well-founded criticisms of Thayer's theory of 
concealing coloration as applied to these ani- 
mals in their native environment. The book 
has good maps, scientific appendixes, colored 
plates after paintings by the artist Rungius 
made in the field, and abundant and generally 
admirable illustrations (barring those of the 
carcasses) picturing the scenery of mountain 
and stream, the trophies of the hunt, and the 
features of camp-life in the wilderness. 

The havoc which man plays with the animal 
life of the land is exceeded, if possible, by his 
exploitation of the mammals of the sea. A very 
clear idea of the nature and extent of this whole- 
sale slaughter can be gained from Mr. David 
Moore Lindsay's " Voyage to the Arctic in the 
Whaler Aurora," which recounts the experiences 
of a surgeon-naturalist on a trip from Dundee to 
the seal fisheries of Newfoundland and a whaling 
cruise in Greenland waters. The Aurora took 
28,150 seals on this cruise, and the annual yield 
of these fisheries is from 300,000 to 600,000 
seals. Improved methods in capture and more 
rigorous search for the booty have led to a grad- 
ual falling off in the catch, as in the case of the 
whale fisheries, though petroleum and the elec- 
tric light are in part responsible for the decline 
of the latter. The author gives a very interest- 
ing and extremely vivid account of the daily 
routine on a whaler, and relates many an ex- 
citing tale of adventure and disaster amid the 
storms, the darkness, and the drifting ice, in the 
midst of which the hardy race of fisher-folk ply 
their venturesome trade and win a meagre and 
fluctuating reward for their labors. Additional 
interest attaches to this work because of the fact 
that the "Aurora" in the cruise here narrated 
took part in the search for the ill-fated Greely 
Expedition. The book is handsomely illustrated 
with over sixty reproductions from photographs. 
It is replete with information pertaining to 
actual operations in the whaling and sealing 
industries, and abounds in whaler's lore. 

The portrayal of the natural history of the 
tiger, king of the Indian jungle, is the aim of Mr. 
S. Eardley-Wilmofs " The Life of a Tiger."

It takes the form of a biographical sketch, into 
which fanciful outline has been woven the ex- 
periences and observations of one evidently 
familiar at first hand with the sport of tiger 
hunting and the varied and interesting life of 
the Indian jungle. The work is exceptionally 
well written, and is free from those exaggera- 
tions, sentimentalities, and forced anthropo- 
morphisms, which not infrequently niar the 
efforts of those who seek to reveal the life of 
the wilds or to stimulate the reader's interest in 
natural history. One feels that it is a real tiger 
in an actual jungle whose vicissitudinous life and 
sad end the author relates. The numerous artis- 
tic pen-sketches and photographs illustrative of 
the life of the jungle are worthy of the text. 

A somewhat matter-of-fact and circumstan- 
tial account of the mammals to be seen in most 
well-stocked zoological gardens is to be found 
in Mr. W. P. Westell's " The Animals and 
their Story." He assorts his menagerie, accord- 
ing to the nature of the habitats of the animals 
composing it, into denizens of the forest and 
jungle, of the plains and deserts, of the hills 
and mountains, and the prowlers of the night. 
This division leads to some incongruity, for we 
find the American timber-wolf treated as a part 
of the fauna of the plains and deserts, the wa- 
piti as belonging to the hills and mountains, and 
the beaver as a prowler of the night. The work 
is descriptive in character, and is supplemented 
by apt quotations from authorities on matters 
of interest or mooted questions such, for ex- 
ample, as the non-protective character of the 
striping of the zebra. A very valuable feature 
of the work lies in the hundred or more excellent 
photographs, by Mr. W. S. Berridge, of ani- 
mals from life, some of which are indeed most 
happy poses quite free from straining bars or 
paddocks which detract from the aesthetic value 
of certain otherwise effective pictures. The 
eight colored plates are happy in design but in- 
effectively executed. The book will be a valu- 
able addition to the reference libraries of our 
schools whose pupils have access to a zoological 
garden. CHARLES ATWOOD KOFOID. 



THE CASK OF A FAMOUS ANARCHIST.* 

It was on the 13th of October, 1909, that 
Francisco Ferrer Guard ia was shot at the fort- 
ress of Montjuich, above Barcelona, in Spain, 
for playing the part of chief in a military 

rebellion." T-n months later. Mr. William

Ej William Archer. New York : Moffat, Yard & Co. 



Archer arrived in that city, commissioned by 
"Scribner's Magazine" to collect all available 
data for determining, if possible, not whether 
Ferrer's views were reasonable, not whether 
Ferrer's life was a useful one, not whether 
Ferrer had in the course of his life been guilty 
of crime, but simply and solely whether In- was 
proved guilty of the offense for which he lost 
his life. It is true that all of the points sug- 
gested are touched on incidentally ; but as to the 
main purpose of the investigation, Mr. Archer 
arrives at the unhesitating conclusion that tin- 
judgment was absolutely unwarranted by the 
evidence. 

Born in 1859, within a few miles of the scene 
of his death, beginning life as a railway clerk. 
Ferrer removed to Paris in 1885, and gained a 
livelihood by acting as translator, copyist, and 
teacher of Spanish, until he succeeded in per- 
suading an elderly maiden lady to leave him her 
fortune. The legitimacy of the means used to 
accomplish this end have nothing to do with the 
case, although Mr. Archer is of the opinion that 
there was nothing so reprehensible in them as 
has sometimes been assumed. He had quar- 
relled with his wife (his daughters agree that 
the fault was principally if not entirely hers), 
had separated from her, and, not being able to 
secure a divorce, had nevertheless lived succes- 
sively with three other women. Such conduct 
is unquestionably open to criticism, especially 
from the point of view of Anglo-Saxon morality ; 
but it seems very distantly related to the question 
of his death, his Clerical critics to the contrary 
notwithstanding. Somewhat more to the point, 
however, is the fact that he had early become an 
anarchist, that he was a very active propagandist 
of subversive doctrines, that he maintained a 
school in Barcelona where anti-religious and 
an ti- governmental doctrines were taught, and, 
more than all this, that he had actually cham- 
pioned violent means of resisting existing insti- 
tutions. But all evidence of a belief in the 
efficacy of violence comes from writings which 
appeared at least seventeen years before his 
death, while proof is abundant that during the 
lastyears of his life he placed his relianceentirely 
in education as a means to the enlightenment 
which will eventuate in a peaceful revolution, 
and deprecated all attempts at abbreviating the 
process. The assertion of his enemies that he 
had decided that the Spani-h nation had been 
sufficiently educated by July, 1909, is too puerile 
to deserve an answer. It is curious to note 
that Mr. Archer has not found evidence of the 
complicity of a single one of Ferrer's pupils

in the excesses of the " Red Week " at Barce- 
lona. 

But our theme is the trial itself. During the 
last week of July the population of Barcelona 
rose in open revolt because of the calling out 
of reservists for the unpopular Moroccan war. 
Thirty churches were burned, and the city was 
in a state of absolute anarchy for sixty hours. 
Troops were called in from other parts of the 
country , and the revolution put down with consid- 
erable bloodshed, most of it lost by the inhabit- 
ants (so that if the rioters were, as the prosecutor 
represented in his plea, "drunk with blood,"' it 
must have been their own that intoxicated them). 
Then Francisco Ferrer, who lived near Barcelona 
and had for some years been carrying on in the 
city itself somewhat sporadically, it is true, 
(not because of any lack of consecutive energy 
on his part, but because the authorities had fits 
of nervousness) a radical school and publish- 
ing business, and who was generally regarded 
by his peasant neighbors in the country and his 
Clerical enemies in the city as a heretic of Satanic 
impulses and almost Satanic powers, was arrested 
and tried for inciting and leading a rebellion 
whose leaders seem really to have been almost 
as completely out of sympathy with him as his 
prosecutors were. Of numerous strange circum- 
stances attending his arrest, perhaps the strangest 
is that before the case was tried, and consequently 
before anyone had data for deciding whether 
the arrest had any justification, his captors were 
rewarded by the government, one with "the 
Order of Isabella the Catholic " a very appro- 
priate testimonial fortheapprehenderof a heretic 
the others with medals and sums of money. 

And now comes the hearing, which is given 
in great detail in Mr. Archer's volume, with 
translations of all testimony and all documents 
which came up for discussion. In his presenta- 
tion of the evidence, Mr. Archer makes a great 
show of impartiality, but of course finds it utterly 
impossible to remain unmoved in the face of so 
sickening a record of judicial murder. That he 
at least came, in the course of his investigation, 
to have another purpose than the merely objective 
statement of fact, is shown by such admissions as 
that " I have refrained from inquiring too closely 
into details, because . . . the whole truth . . . 
must not yet be published " (p. 151). But his 
caution presumably does not affect the accuracy 
or completeness of his version of the proceedings 
at the trial. 

Ferrer was convicted by a military tribunal, 
because under the Spanish law an offense against 
the Army must be tried by the Army, by a 



colonel, that is, who is only a temporary and im- 
provised judge, hence an incompetent one, with 
counsel who suffer the same disabilities, and in 
a ridiculously short time. Ferrer's trial lasted 
five hours. His attorney had had twenty-four 
hours to study the case and was allowed one hour 
for his plea. The prisoner was dead in ninety- 
six hours from the time his hearing began a 
record of promptness which it would be hard to 
duplicate in modern criminal annals. 

It is sometimes a disadvantage to be cele- 
brated and to have all eyes upon one. Thus, 
Ferrer, who had decided during this year of 1909 
to publish a Spanish edition of Prince Kropot- 
kin's last book, sent 900 francs to Barcelona 
for " La Grande Revolution," which was inter- 
preted by the police to mean that he had financed 
the riots. An article of his publication entitled 
" Le Dynamisme Atomique " was assumed by 
the authorities to be a treatise on dynamite ; and 
a translation of Poe's " Raven " was seen to be 
clearly anarchistic, since the author had set a 
" bust of Pallas " just above his " chamber 
door." (Pallas was the anarchist who threw a 
bomb at Marshal Martinez y Campos in 1893). 

The evidence presented falls under four heads. 
There are, first, expressions of unsupported 
opinion and hearsay. Thus, Colonel Ponte of 
the Guardia Civil asserts that Ferrer was active 
in riots which occurred in the villages of Masnou 
and Premia, basing his assertion on confidences 
whose author or authors he is not at liberty to 
reveal. Jimenez Moya states that in his opinion 
the rebellion started with Ferrer. Verdaquer 
Callis makes a similar statement on the strength 
of intelligence which he has no means of verify- 
ing. Emiliano Iglesias believes, as does Baldo- 
mero Bonet. Garcia Magalon was told by a jour- 
nalist named Pierre that he had heard it said. 

Second is a mass of irrelevant accusation. 
Lorenzo Ardid states that Ferrer left a cafe sud- 
denly on the afternoon of the first day of the 
rioting, because certain apologists of authority 
were present. Two soldiers saw a man in a blue 
suit and a straw hat in a group of people on a 
public square. Francisco Domenech says that 
Ferrer told him that he had prepared an address 
to the government demanding the cessation of 
embarkation for Africa ; and so on. 

Third is matter which if substantiated would 
have a certain weight. Most important under 
this head is the testimony of the journalist 
Colldefons, who saw Ferrer " leading a group " 
during the rioting. But Colldefons had never 
seen Ferrer before, and identified him only from 
a photograph he had seen of him. He saw him 



52 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



"between seven-thirty and eight-thirty in the 
evening," hence l>y the <lrcrj>tive light of the 
street-lamps. If we take this statement in con- 
nection with Domenech's evidence that Fem-r 
walked home with him the night before, eleven 
miles out from Barcelona, reaching home at five 
o'clock in the morning, and if we remember that 
there were no trains running that day, it would 
seem very unlikely that Ferrer was leading a 
group " in Barcelona at seven-thirty that even- 
ing. But a group of Republicans from the vil- 
lages of Masnou and Premia de Mar agree that 
Ferrer urged the proclamation of the Republic, 
and tried to incite to convent-burning in those 
villages during the Red Week. The evidence 
of these gentlemen is perhaps rendered a little 
dubious by the fact that they had all themselves 
been imprisoned for sedition and were testifying 
to save their own skins. 

Lastly, we have the documentary evidence 
the manuscript proclamation of 1892 which we 
have already hinted at, and which has no nec- 
essary bearing on conditions in 1909, and a 
dilapidated type-written manifesto which the 
police claim to have found in Ferrer's house a 
month after the riots, a paper containing three 
letters inserted in ink (a " t " and a " ba ") 
which the handwriting experts say " might have 
been written by Ferrer." 

Ferrer's own evidence was not flawless. He 
coutradicts himself on several minor points, and 
fails to tell what later investigation has shown 
to be the whole truth with regard to several 
others. But this reticence and uncertainty can 
be adequately explained by his anxiety not to 
implicate others. 

And thus a narrow and fanatical mediocrity, 
of excellent intentions, who had perhaps done 
some good in the world, for his school, with all 
its faults, was better than the inexpressible State 
schools, was persecuted and done to death for 
insufficient cause, and thus a second-rate intelli- 
gence who would scarcely have been known out- 
side his own city was crowned with martyrdom ; 
thus the Spanish Catholic Church, which it is 
no disparagement of the Catholic Church in gen- 
eral to qualify as one of the rottenest institutions 
in existence, dealt itself such a blow as its clev- 
erest enemy could scarcely have given it ; thus 
a ministry fell and an uncertain monarchy tilted 
a degree further from stable equilibrium. It 
is not only Christian martyrs whose blood bears 
fruit. 

Mr. Archer's book is a conscientiously accu- 
mulated mass of evidence rather than a narra- 
tive. It might have IM-CII considerably smaller. 



and it might have been >'.I>\>T to follow with a 
somewhat different arrangement : but such as 
it is, it will probably remain for English- 
speaking readers the best and completest source 
of information on a subject which has consider- 
able interest and a certain historical importance.

RECENT POKTUY.* 

Interest and beauty in profusion and goodly 
variety are to be found in the volume which collect* 
the poems of Mi-s Katharine Lee Bates, and which 
is entitled " America tbe Beautiful." Here, for ex- 
ample, in " The First Voyage of John Cabot," is a 
historical incident effectively crystallized : 

" ' He chases shadows,' sneered the Bristol tars, 
1 As well fling nets to catch the golden stars 
As climb the surges of earth's utmost sea.' 
But for the Venice pilot, meagre, wan, 
His swarthy sons beside him, life began 
With that slipt cable, when his dream rode free. 

" And Henry, on his battle-wrested throne, 
The Councils done, would speak in musing tone 
Of Cabot, not the cargo he might bring. 
' Man's heart, though morsel scant for hungry crow, 
Is greater than a world can fill, and so 
Fair fall the shadow -seekers !' quoth the king." 

The capricious lines " In the Philippines " yield 
this touch of bitter truth in harmonious expression: 

" The flag that dreamed of delivering 
Shudders and droops like a broken wing. 

"Silvery rice-fields whisper wide 
How for home and freedom their owners died." 

The tribute to Christina Rossetti opens with this 
beautiful stanza: 

" It was little for her to die, 

For her to whom breath was prayer, 
For her who had long put by 
Earth-desire ;

Who had knelt in the Holy Place 
And had drunk the incense-air, 
Till her soul to seek God's face 
Leapt like fire." 

There are many such personal tributes in the collec- 
tion, but none more heartfelt and tender than that 
inscribed to Sophie Jewett, of which one of the 
stanzas may be given : 

" Thou art not of the shadows, ah, not thou, 

Our Dryad soul, the soul of April woods 
Where flames of color, caught from bough to bough, 

And winds of fragrance blend beatitudes. 
Not in the withered groves whose phantoms follow 

Like drifted leaves the feet of Proserpine, 
Not in the whispering midnights dim and hollow, 

Shall love re-capture that lost grace of thine ; 
Beauty and light are with thee where thou art ; 
We grope thy pathway by the haunted heart." 

These bits, which are all that we may quote, give but 
a faint idea of the wealth of the volume as a whole. 
Thus brought together, the work of Miss Bates may 
be clearly seen to entitle her to a place in the front 
rank of our American women who are also poets. 

The high rank of another of these women 
Miss Josephine Preston Peabody hardly needs to 
be asserted since the success of " The Piper," and 
there is no surprise for us, no need for revaluation, 
in her new book, "The Singing Man." The deep- 
est of social sympathy is felt in the titular poem, 
whose thought is that of " those unnumbered who 
pay all the heavier cost of life, to live and die 
without knowledge that there is any Joy of Living." 
The toiler sings no more, for the skies are dark 
above him, and his eyes must be fixed upon the 
task which gains for him his bread. It is the poet 
who must voice his inarticulate cry. 

" Oh, in the wakening thunders of the heart, 

The small lost Eden, troubled through the night, 
Sounds there not now, forboded and apart, 

Some voice and sword of light : 
Some voice and portent of a dawn to break ? 
Searching like God, the ruinous human shard 
Of that lost Brother-man Himself did make, 
And Man himself hath marred ? 

" It sounds ! And may the anguish of that birth 
Seize on the world ; and may all shelters fail, 
Till we behold new Heaven and new Earth 

Through the rent Temple-vail ! 
When the high-tides that threaten near and far 

To sweep away our guilt before the sky, 
Flooding the waste of this dishonored Star, 
Cleanse, and o'erwhelm, and cry! 

" Cry, from the deep of world-accusing wars, 

With longing more than all since Light began, 
Above the nations, underneath the graves, 
' Give back the Singing Man ! ' " 

This sense of the human tragedy, thrilled with the 
note of hopefulness, is found in many of the remain- 
ing pieces. We turn for relief to the sonnet called 
" Noon at Psestum," which we are minded to take 
for a second quotation because it recalls the solemn 
joy of a summer noon of our own long years ago, 
spent in solitary communion with the temples and 
the hills and the sea. 



" Lord of the Sea, we sun-filled creatures raise 

Our hands among the clamorous weeds, we too. 

Lord of the Sun, and of the upper blue, 
Of all To-morrow, and all yesterdays, 
Here, where the thousand broken names and ways 

Of worship are but shards we wandered through, 

There is no gift to offer, or undo ; 
There is no prayer left in us, only praise. 

" Only to glory in this glory here, 

Through the dead smoke of myriad sacrifice ; 
To look through these blue spaces, blind and clear, 

Even as the seaward gaze of Homer's eyes; 
And from uplifted heart, and cup, to pour 
Wine to the Unknown God. We ask no more." 

" The Overture, and Other Poems " is a volume 
of verse by Mr. Jefferson Butler Fletcher. " The 
Overture " is a dramatic sketch in which Richard, 
Cosima, and Hans play the parts of Tristan, Iseult, 
and Mark, accompanied by Wagnerian music on the 
piano. When Mark discovers the intrigue, he dashes 
cold water upon the guilty wife's heroics. To the 
latter shrieking, " Kill me ! " he replies : 

" Tut, tut ! you have mistaken your stage-cue : 
I am no more King Mark than Iseult yon, 
Or Tristan he. I am a plain trousered man 
Whose wife fancies another trousered man." 

Mr. Fletcher also writes about other frail ladies, 
Lilith in particular, and usually in lines sawn into 
a semblance of blank verse. He can be quite sar- 
donic at times, as in " The Children's Hour." 

" As we staid elders at the children's hour 
Give out some riddle stale long, long ago, 
And listen amused, as down the eager row 
In turn each tries his (Edipean power ; 
So sit the indulgent gods ; before them our 
Most sapient masters of all those who know. 
Just now one Nietzsche guesses. La Rochefoucauld 
Applauds ; and Voltaire nudges Schopenhauer. 
Again the Delphian drawls his question ; ages 
To ages echo each response ; and men 
Painfully hearken. Meanwhile old Vulcan nods ; 
The Cyprian plays Minerva, souls for gages ; 
Jove kisses Psyche ; Cupid pouts and then 
Peals the low belling laughter of the Gods." 

Sometimes the author is simple and natural, as in 
" The Daisy Field," and then we like him best. 

" Man looked upon the sky by night, 

And loved its tender azure, bright 

With many a softly beaming light ; 

And sang his Maker's praises. 

" ' The sun declares Thee in Thy dread ; 
But from the stars Thy peace is shed ; 
Would that by day they comforted ! ' 
God heard ; and made the daisies. 

" All in a firmament of green 
Their golden orbs now float, serene, 
Twinkling with rays of silvery sheen, 
To comfort him who gazes." 

Mr. Butler also makes beautiful translations from 
Petrarch and other Italian poets. 

Sonnets and lyrics upon the ancient theme of love, 
varied with an occasional ballad, make up the con- 
tents of Mr. Joyce Kilmer's " Summer of Love." 
We give a sonnet called " Love's Thoroughfare."

THE DIAL, 



[Jan. 16, 



" As down the primrose path of Love I trod 
The golden Sowers kissed my eager feet, 
The wayisde trees with singing birds were sweet, 
The summer air was like the smile of God. 
* Turn back ! ' said one, ' escape the avenging rod. 
Soon thou the deathless flames of Hell shall meet.' 
Bnt I pressed on and thought of no retreat, 
Till soon with fire I was clothed and shod. 

" But through the burning vales of Hell where flow 

The molten streams of bitterest despair, 
Made blind by pain I stumbled on, and lo ! 

I stood at last in Love's own perfumed air. 
So, having reached ray journey's end, I know 

That God made Hell to be Love's thoroughfare." 

The same thought is expressed, and with even more 
effectiveness, in "The Morning Meditations of Frere 
Hyacinthus," which is too long for quotation. It is, 
of course, the familiar Paolo and Francesca situa- 
tion, which has appealed to many a passionate poet 
since Dante. 

Mr. Benjamin Low sings of " The Sailor Who 
Has Sailed," and brought back the freightage of 
experience, in the following strain : 

" There is treasure-trove in my hands, but gold 

I bring not back with me ; 
There are songs on deck and in the hold, 
Bnt no wild minstrelsy. 

' I have dreamed the dream of the unknown sea ; 

I have sailed from the sightless shore ; 
I have looked in the eyes of reality, 
And I am young ... no more." 

" The Vigil-at-Arms " is a fine poem of some length, 
revealing the inmost soul of the night- watcher, its 
alternating moods of doubt and hopefulness, as the 
darkness wanes and the dawn draws near. These 
are the closing stanzas : 

I am afraid, Lord, is it thither thou 

Would'st have me go ? 
I am afraid, and would wend backward now 

Where violets grow : 
My heart is fickle for the fields, I yearn 
Once more at eve to see my windows burn ; 
Once more, ah, let me, down old paths to turn, 

I love them so. 

" Nay ! 't is the morrow, yonder leaded panes 

No more are dim 
With dark-browed infidels, but are the fanes 

Of seraphim ; 

And holy saints and warriors are dight 
With jewelled colors flaming in their flight, 
And out of heaven, wrapt in lovely light, 

The rafters swim. 

" It is the morrow, Lord, the sweet airs blow 

Up the long nave, 
And plight the day's full troth, yet . . . ere I go, 

One thing I crave : 

Thou that art death, and ridest on a sword ; 
Thou that art love, upon a cross adored ; 
Thou that art life, and life eternal, Lord . . . 

Let me be brave!" 

The high spirituality of these verses is found in 
many other pages of the volume, and is perhaps the 
most distinctive note of the whole collection. 

Mr. John Vance Cheney, who has become once 
more a poet of California, bringing back to his old- 



time haunts a store of rich reflection and ripe experi- 
ence, makes us realize anew the wealth of poetical 
material offered by the natural beauty, the Indian 
legendry, and the romantic history of the Pacific 
Coast. His lines Before the Portrait of Padre 
Junipero" may be taken to exemplify this offering 
of California verse. 

" Faithful the nameless radiance still 
Upon these features ; never dies 
The light that did his spirit till. 

The halt priest with the heavenly eyes. 

" It lamped his feet through the long night. 
He walked where now the ruins are, 
111-' one unbroken mother-light 
Running from roses to the star. 

" His heart-beat was the Mission chime ; 

The lowly leader keeps his place. 
The stars will wear it while they climb, 
The light upon this friar's face.'' 

Mr. Cheney's volume is called " At the Silver Gate," 
and is beautifully illustrated by many photographs. 
Simple sentiments and thoughts, embodied in 
unpretending verse, are offered us by the " New 
Poems" of Mr. Stephen Coleridge. We choose 
" Laus Amori " for our quotation. 

" Love wisely if you have the wit 
Nor suffer it beyond control, 
Love as the angels if you can 
Let passion sanctify the soul. 

" Love while the blood throbs in the veins, 
Love while the rosy lips are pure, 
Love while the breath of life is strong 
While love's long ecstasies endure. 

" Love in the morning's pageantry, 
In the fierce sun's creative light ; 
Love in the evening's yielding hour, 
And in the sacramental night. 

" Love while the earth lasts underneath 
And the great firmament above. 
Love to the deeps of time and space, 
For love is God, if God be love!" 

Mr. Coleridge has a prefatory note in which he tells 
us how his verses came to be first published in this 
country, and, incidentally, that our heart is in the 
right place in spite of the fact that we countenance 
the antics of the spelling deformers. It may divert 
a youthful and irreverent press to play fantastic 
tricks before high heaven with tin- spelling of our 
august and glorious speech, but the consecrated 
phrases that well up from the beating heart of our 
race telling of freedom, honour, love, mercy, and 
peace appeal instantly to something common to us 
all." 

Mr. John Drinkwater's " Poems of Men and 
Hours " are grave and decorous compositions, cun- 
ningly fashioned, and appealing to the reflective 
mind. "The Soldier" is a favorable example. 

" The large report of fame I lack, 

And shining clasps and crimson scars, 
For I have held my bivouac 

Alone amid the untroubled stars.

" My battlefield lias known no dawn 
Beclouded by a thousand spears; 
I 've been no mounting tyrant's pawn 
To buy his glory with my tears. 

" It never seemed a noble thing 

Some little leagues of land to gain 
From broken men, nor yet to fling 
Abroad the thunderbolts of pain. 

" Yet I have felt the quickening breath 

As peril heavy peril kissed 
My weapon was a little faith, 
And fear was my antagonist. 

" Not a brief hour of cannonade, 

But many days of bitter strife, 
Till God of his great pity laid 

Across my brow the leaves of life." 

A group of tributes to the poets Swinburne, 
Meredith, Watson, and Hardy is one of the most 
pleasing features of this modest volume. 

" The Wanderer, and Other Poems," by Mr. 
Henry Bryan Binns, is graciously heralded by a 
frontispiece photogravure of Botticelli's " Birth of 
Venus." This provides the titular poem a dialogue 
between the Earth Spirit and the Winds with its 
theme. It is the Earth Spirit who asks, 

" What car is this ye blow ? 

And what is this white Blossom of the cool grey Sea 
That worshipping ye hasten Her, and throw 
Flowers after Her in glee ? 
And wherefore is she inwardly so bright 
That, all and every whit, 
Her body with delight 
Illumined is, and like a pearl is it ? 

" And tell me, tell me, wherefore are Her eyes 
Purposeful, infinite, 
Transcending any thought, 

As though unto the Sea the streams had brought, 
From the mountains where they rise, 
High ultimate passion 
Of tempest and of stress, 
Out of its wonder, in the deeps, to fashion 
This loveliness ? " 

Mr. Binns is not solely preoccupied with the world 
of fancy ; the world of men also engages his atten- 
tion, particularly in " The Building of the City," a 
longish poem from which we make this excerpt : 

" To every citadel of wrong 
Her stones cry out a battle-song ; 
She is so wrought of manly stuff 
The nations have not power enough 
To silence her : her heart is free 
From any fear of any : She 
Can take the world's assaulting shock 
Builded so on the Living Rock. 

" I see the city being wrought 
Upon the rock of Living Thought; 
Upon her rising walls I look, 
And every stone is like a book 
Of many milk-white pages, fair 
Imprinted, with a loving care ; 
While on each lovely page is set 
Word of a wisdom lovelier yet." 

Mr. Binns's pages are few, but they are like the 
pages to which the stones of his city are likened 
touched with distinction and the gleam of the ideal. 



Sir Arthur Doyle has picked up the Kipling 
banjo, and twangs it to much the same effect as its 
original possessor. Sometimes the tune is serious : 

" God guard our Indian brothers, 

The Children of the Sun, 
Guide us and walk beside us, 

Until Thy will be done. 
To all be equal measure, 

Whate'er his blood or birth, 
Till we shall build as Thou hast willed 

O'er all Thy fruitful Earth." 

Sometimes the tune is jocular: 

" Eighty Tommies, big and small, 

Grumbling hard as is their habit. 
' Say, mate, what's a Bunerwal ? ' 

' Somethin' like a bloomin' rabbit.' 
' Got to hoof it to Chitral ! ' 

' Blarst ye, did ye think to cab it!' 
Eighty Tommies, big and small, 

Grumbling hard as is their habit." 

We are particularly taken with the story of " Bendy 's 
Sermon." Bendy was a ''converted" prize-fighter, 
who took to preaching at revival meetings. On one 
occasion, his hearers chaffed him beyond endurance, 
and this is what followed : 

" Then Bendy said, ' Good Lord, since first I left my sinful 



Thou knowest that to Thee alone I 've given up my days, 
But now, dear Lord ' and here he laid his Bible on the 

shelf 
'I'll take, with your permission, just five minutes for 

myself.' 

" He vaulted from the pulpit like a tiger from a den, 
They say it was a lovely sight to see him floor his men ; 
Right and left, and left and right, straight and true and 

hard, 
Till the Ebenezer Chapel looked more like a knacker's 

yard." 

A " lovely sight " it must have been indeed ! Sir 
Arthur gives us much variety in this volume, albeit 
its compass is small. We commend "Shakespeare's 
Expostulation " to readers in whose bonnet the 
Baconian bee has buzzed. 

The little pieces that Lady Alfred Douglas has 
called " The Inn of Dreams " are butterflies or hum- 
ming-birds of verse flitting from one flower of fancy 
to another to extract from each a drop of honeyed 
thought. This drop is called " Daffodil Dawn " : 

" While I slept, and dreamed of you, 
Morning, like a princess, came, 
All in robe of palest blue ; 
Stooped and gathered in that hour 
From the east a golden flower, 
Great and shining flower of flame . . . 
Then she hastened on her way 
Singing over plain and hill 
While I slept and dreamed of you 
Dreams that never can come true . . . 
Morning at the gates of Day, 
Gathered Dawn, the daffodil." 

Such verse is charming, but futile just good 
enough to occupy an idle moment or a nook in 
some magazine. 

The lady who signs herself " Dolf Wyllarde " has 
a pretty talent in verse-making, as readers of the

songs in her novels have long since discovered. Her 
" Verses " now published have a fairly wide range, 
from songs of passion to impressions of travel. They 
are a little hectic at times, and exhibit a soul that 
seems to be still seeking for anchorage. These 
stanzas on " Lower London " are good enough to be 
almost impressive : 

" Beneath His quiet skies His quiet skies! 

We shriek and die, 

And watch the morning and the ere go by, 
And shudder to this God, who does not heed our cries. 

" We could bear all things were He less divine 

He does not care ! 

He set us in this toil of our despair, 

And straight withdrew Himself, and gave no hint of His 
design. 

" Grey pall of sullen cloud and sapphire dim 

Are all we meet, 

Until His sunset breaks along the street 
And turns our sordid City to a fleeting proof of Him. 

" But then the cloud returns, the glory dies 

Then shriek and curse 

In gaslit hells that show them nothing worse 
Than open night beneath His quiet skies . . . His quiet 
skies!"

volumes of 

"Emerson's Journals" (Houghton 
Mifflin Co.) are much like those 
which have gone before, but contain rather more 
that is of interest to the ordinary reader of Emer- 
son. The years which they cover, 1838 to 1844, saw 
the founding of Brook Farm and of Alt-oil's Fruit- 
lands, the beginning and the end of the elder " Dial," 
and, among events of more intimate concern to 
Emerson, the delivery of the Divinity School Ad- 
dress, the publication of the first and the second 
series of "Essays," the residence of Thorean in 
Emerson's household, and the death of his son. These 
were years of much reading, writing, and lecturing, 
and of patient listening to the erratic bores who were 
now coming to Concord in great numbers, and whose 
visits Emerson endured as an edifying affliction. 
" ' Long Beard ' and 'Short Beard,' who came hither 
the other day with intent as it seemed to make Arte- 
sian Wells of us, taught me something." The fact 
that, as in previous journals, the philosopher refers 
so seldom to passing events gives an especial inter- 
est to the few records like the following : " I went 
to the circus. . . . One horse brought a basket in 
his teeth, picked up a cap, and selected a card out 
of four. All wonder comes of showing an effect at 
two or three removes from the cause. Show us the 
two or three steps by which the horse was brought 
to fetch the basket, and the wonder would cease. 
But I and Waldo were of one mind when he said, 
' It makes me want to go home.' " A longer passage 
gives Emerson's impressions of Fanny Elssler's danc- 
ing. The death of his son broke down his reserve, 



and in the days immediately following he wrote many 
touching comments, som. <>f which he repeated 
rather less effectively in hi> " Thn-nodv.' Then- 
are occasional literary criticisms, some of them ex- 
pressed in a single phrase, as "Tennyson is a beau- 
tiful half of a poet "; and there are free comments 
on men that he had known. Alcott, Webster, Chan- 
ning, and others, are discussed at some length; but 
the most effective characteri/ation* are in telling 
phrases. "A. [Alcott?] is a tedious archangel." 
"T. P. [Theodore Parker?] has beautiful fangs, and 
the whole amphitheatre delights to see him worry 
and tear his victim." A few bits of autobiography 
and self-criticism are of interest In 1839 Emerson 
wrote : " When I was thirteen years old, my Uncle 
Samuel Ripley one day asked me ' How is it. Ralph. 
that all the boys dislike you and quarrel with you, 
whilst the grown people are fond of you?' Now 
I am thirty-six, and the fact is reversed, the old 
people suspect and dislike me, and the young love 
me." Of the twentieth reunion of his college class, 
he says: I drank a great deal of wine (for me), 
with the wish to raise my spirits to the pitch of good 
fellowship ; but the wine produced on me its old 
effect, and I grew graver with every glass. Indigna- 
tion and eloquence will excite me, but wine does not" 

A prophet of the The Scammon Lectures for 1911, 
riattir revival of delivered before the Art Institute of 
Art in America. Chicago by Mr. Kenyon Cox, have 
been published under the title "The Classic Point 
of View " (Scribner). Classicism in the art of 
painting may seem anachronistic in these days of 
impressionists, post-impressionists, " cubistes," and 
that other school which aims to represent the hu- 
man figure, not by cubes, but " as a series of tri- 
angles." None the less, when we find critics writing 
to prove that this art of the present is real and vital, 
that it will become the art of the future, the need of 
striking some note of reaction in the direction of 
old-fashioned sanity is sufficiently obvious. This is 
what Mr. Cox has set himself to do ; and in general 
he has done it admirably. He has given us a 
definite credo a detailed and explicit confession 
of artistic faith," which occasionally lapses into 
polemic as might be expected from the neces- 
sities of the case. After all, as Wilde said, only an 
auctioneer can admire impartially all the schools of 
art; and it must be confessed that our author dis- 
plays a surprising amount of self-control. In the 
face of great temptations to indulge in destructive 
irony, he keeps in the main to constructive criti- 
cism. He shows us how the classic tradition was 
lost, and what we must do to regain it ; for it is 
here in America, unhampered 1-y traditions of her 
own and not yet satiated by that classic beauty 
which has become an old story abroad it is line, 
our painter-critic believes, that the world's chance 
of a successful classical revival lies. A chapter on 
the value of the subject in art follows the title lec- 
ture, and a discussion of " Design " brings out the 
importance of composition as a characteristic of the

classic tradition. Chapters on Drawing, Light and 
Shade and Color, and a final discussion of tech- 
nique in general, complete the volume, which is 
rich in historical detail and presents an interesting 
if somewhat discursive picture of the evolution of 
painting under the old masters. The book should 
be widely read, not only by the young artists for 
whom it was primarily intended, but by every art- 
lover who aspires to a deeper insight, and by every 
critic who has learned the vividness of the artist's 
view-point when discussing his art. The volume is 
generously and aptly illustrated, although the plates 
are not inserted at the proper places in the text, 
and a worse fault the book has no index of 
proper names to facilitate reference. 

A versatile and A devoted son has no easy task when 
erratic man he tries to interpret to the world the 
of letters. character of a versatile, individual, 

almost erratic father. The " Life and Memoirs of 
John Churton Collins" (Lane) leaves the reader 
here and there with a sense of inadequacy, though 
it is written frankly and in good taste by his son, 
Mr. L. C. Collins. The subject of the memoir ap- 
pears not only as critic and essayist, but as inde- 
fatigable University Extension lecturer, curious 
student of criminology, member of the Murder Club 
and the Ghost Club, and in many other activities. 
One bit of self-analysis deserves to be quoted : " I 
cannot call to mind a single human being who has 
had the slightest influence on me. My intense love 
of literature was inspired by no one, encouraged by 
no one, influenced by no one. It awoke suddenly 
and spontaneously my life, my deeper life, has 
been essentially and permanently solitary." This 
seems strange from a man who was so genial, and 
who had so many close personal and literary friends. 
Perhaps the most readable parts of the memoirs are 
those which record Collins's acquaintance with more 
or less distinguished English authors. Readers who 
know the personalities of both men will be interested 
in his impressions of Browning in 1881 : " With 
Browning I was miserably disappointed ; there was 
a marked vulgarity about him, particularly in his 
accent and in the tone of his voice, and a certain in- 
describable savour of sycophancy of a man eager to 
be of a grade to which he did not belong ; but the 
poet was there the poet's keen eye the poet's 
heart obvious in his remarks and descriptions: a 
sad, very thoughtful face, a great weight of thought 
over the eyes for the rest a commonplace face and 
a very commonplace manner, in the brow and the eye 
only sat genius : his conversation except when he 
was speaking of his reminiscences about Carlyle 
studiously commonplace." A story of the rupture 
between Collins and Swinburne deserves notice by 
the future historian of literary amenities. Collins, 
replying in the " Athenaeum " to some author who 
took a review of his works as a personal matter, re- 
marked that he had attacked Swinburne's prose 
with the greatest severity, and that he and Swin- 
burne were still, as they had been for years, the 



closest of friends. Swinburne, it appeared, had 
never seen the attack. When he read it to ascer- 
tain the extent of his magnanimity, he was so in- 
censed that he broke off the intimacy, and appar- 
ently never really became reconciled. 

The critic who puts out a volume 
ofour'fime? dealing with contemporary writers 

deserves more thanks than he is 
likely to receive. Such a book is an invaluable 
source of information regarding men who are not 
yet enshrined or entombed in more formal 
works ; but from the first, every reader is sure to 
dissent from some of its judgments, and in time it 
is cited only as an illustration of the absurdities 
which all contemporary criticism is sure to commit. 
In "Some American Story Tellers" (Holt), Mr. 
Frederic Taber Cooper presents essays on Francis 
Marion Crawford, Kate Douglas Wiggin, Winston 
Churchill, Robert W. Chambers, Ellen Glasgow, 
David Graham Phillips, Robert Herrick, Edith 
Wharton, Newton Booth Tarkington, '' O. Henry," 
Gertrude Atherton, Owen Wister, Frank Norris, 
and Ambrose Bierce. This list must be given in 
full, since Mr. Cooper nowhere tells his principle of 
selection, and it is hard to see why some of these 
authors were taken and others left. Many of the 
sketches originally appeared in magazine form, and 
this may account for a slightly unfortunate lack of 
uniformity in plan. A few give the essential facts 
of an author's life, while others must be supple- 
mented by reference to " Who's Who in America, " 
or some other manual of contemporary biography. 
In some cases the plots of novels and tales are 
briefly summarized, in others the criticism implies 
that the reader already knows the author's works. 
These, however, are minor defects. Mr. Cooper 
has resisted the temptation, which besets a writer 
for a popular magazine, to reverse the old proverb 
and say only good of the living ; and he has made 
no attempt at smartness of treatment, or at the ex- 
ploitation of striking theories. His criticisms are 
the dignified application to each writer's works of 
his own fairly definite idea of what modern fiction 
should be. His views will not find general accept- 
ance ; but his book is interesting to read, and not- 
withstanding its omissions it will occupy a place for 
the next ten years on the reference shelves of the 
student of American literature. 



To every reader who has any inter- 
SSfJKSS? est \ n the Jiving stream of events 

that is passing so rapidly into East- 
ern history, we hasten to recommend Mr. Lovat 
Eraser's "India under Curzon and After" (Holt). 
The well-known editor of " The Times of India " 
covers five hundred large pages in treating his 
theme ; but the subject matter is so important, the 
presentation so straightforward, and most of the 
conclusions so authoritative, that one is likely to 
bring in a charge of undue brevity rather than of pro- 
lixity. If the reader will remember that Mr. Fraser 



58 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



frankly avows his admiration of Lord Curzon's 
policy in general, there will be little need of further 
caution. Moreover, our individual admiration <>r 
dislike for Lord Curzon should not interfere with 
our enjoyment or profit ; for the volume still offers 
a most valuable and entertaining survey of recent 
history and present conditions, and prepares us for 
an intelligent consideration of British rule under the 
reforms of Lord Morley and the changes just an- 
nounced at the Durbar. In pleasing contrast to 
ninety per cent of the current books on India, it em- 
bodies the thoughts and observations of an author 
deserving an audience. As a newspaper editor, Mr. 
Eraser has had unusual opportunities for acquiring 
knowledge, and as a man of trained intelligence he 
has been able to profit by his information. He is a 
loyal Briton ; but, like the best of his countrymen, 
he is fully alive to defects in administration as well 
as to errors in general policy. It inspires confidence 
to read his strictures on " the pernicious practice of 
government from hill-stations," or on the sacrifice 
of Indian interests to Lancashire manufactures, 
just as it is a pleasure to note his genuine sympathy 
for Indian aspirations and his joy " in great deeds 
worthily done " by his compatriots. We cannot 
even give the captions of the various chapters, much 
less criticise minor slips of presentation or adduce 
differences of opinion. But this matters very little ; 
for we should conclude by renewing our warm re- 
commendation of this timely and readable book by 
a thoroughly competent author. 

Development of There is much in Mr.Tucker Brooke's 
our dramatic " The Tudor Drama " (Houghton) to 
commend it to more than the special 
student of our literature. In the first place, the plan 
is excellent. Instead of carrying the drama through 
to its decay and death in the closing of the theatres 
in 1642, when by a curious fiction the Elizabethan 
drama is said to end ; Mr. Brooke ends the Tudor 
drama with the last of the Tudors, or he does so 
with as much exactness as is possible in a work of this 
character. New conditions, especially those due to 
Puritan opposition, make really a new chapter of 
the Caroline drama, so that the Tudor drama has an 
independent unity. We have therefore in the work 
before us a treatment of the rise and consummate 
development of the greatest literature of the race. 
The drama is treated chronologically till adherence 
to chronology ceases to be a virtue, and then influ- 
ences and types form the headings of the chap- 
ters. If one wishes to follow the work of any one 
author through this period, it calls for considerable 
agility to jump from pastoral and romantic comedy 
to history play and to the drama of contemporary 
incident But in a book of this kind one is more 
interested in a study of types and the progress of 
dramatic expression. In the second place, Mr. 
Brooke treats his subject with fine critical discrim- 
ination. He does not rehash worn-out opinions or 
long-accepted judgments, but he treats each theme 
with a freshness and an originality that make even 



a history of literature interesting. \\Y might just 
mention hi* plausible theory that Shakespeare's 
"purge" (mentioned in "The Return from Par- 
nassus ") refers to a passage 'hat originally appeared 
in the version of " Hamlet " a* acted in Canihridge 
in 1601-2, and was later omitted by Heming and 
Condell from the First Folio in order not to offend 
Jonson. The theory has the merit of not being at 
present capable of direct refutation. Neither can 
it be at present proved. The bibliographieH at tin- 
close of every chapter are well chosen. 



A itudv of Recent discussions of standards of 

waget in the living and the amount of economic 
United stain. goods necessary to maintain a stand- 
ard of efficiency have led Professor Scott Near ing 
of the University of Pennsylvania to a consideration 
of " Wages in the United States" (Macmillan), 
from statistics covering the years from 1908 to 
1910. The lack of uniformity in gathering and 
tabulating wage reports, and in many cases the 
entire absence of any statistics at all, is recognized, 
and the conclusions are set down as by no means 
final although based on statistical proof which must 
stand until overthrown by additional studies. The 
statistics are taken from reports of Massachusetts 
(which are especially commended), New Jersey and 
Kansas, special wage reports of the telephone indus- 
try, of wages of women in Illinois department stores, 
of the Bethlehem Steel Works investigation, of the 
Bureau of Labor, and of the Interstate Commerce 
Commission. The reports concerning average wages 
are shown to be incomplete, and in a measure inac- 
curate; but they are alike in various States, and so 
approximately correct in showing that the average 
of wages is about the same in all sections of the 
country. The conclusion is given that in the terri- 
tory east of the Rockies and north of Mason and 
Dixon's line " three-quarters of the adult males and 
nineteen-twentieths of the adult females actually 
earn less than $600 a year." Actual wages and 
proposed standards of living are not commensurate ; 
and while one may say that the statistics are not 
definite enough to afford very certain conclusions, 
the fact remains that such statistics as are available 
show a low average. While the book is perhaps 
not conclusive, it represents an honest effort to get 
at the actual facts. 

Relation* of Under the title of " The Fundamental 
ptvchologv Laws of Human Behavior," Profes- 
and conduct. gor ^j^,, Meyer, of the University of 
Missouri, publishes a series of lectures which serve 
as a text upon the physiological basis of elementary 
psychological processes ( Richard G. Badger, Boston). 
The book has the advantage of singleness of purpose 
and unity of subject. It attempts to explain, largely 
by means of hypothetical diagrams, the presumptive 
processes that go on within the nervous system and 
outwardly influence human behavior. This is an im- 
portant part of the basis of psychology for students, 
as also for the understanding of behavior practically

and theoretically. It is less clear to what extent this 
method may be carried and still remain profitable. 
To the hypothetical diagrams no exception can be 
taken, but only to their complexity and their detailed 
elaboration. One may naturally ask whether the 
resulting benefit is not dubious or even specious. 
This applies more particularly to the more quantita- 
tive and diagrammatic argument, and the mechanical 
analogies of resistance, power, energy, flux, and the 
like. Apart from this query, the volume serves to 
cover the ground. It may be that the interest in be- 
havior from this point of view is limited to students 
and professors of psychology. It is well that so 
acceptable a compendium of this cross-section of the 
fundamentals of behavior should be available.

1 '' that n man is entitled to write of 

the Orient who has not lived under 
its brilliant sun for at least a quarter of a century. 
This exacting requirement is filled, with eleven 
years to the good, by M. Pierre Ponafidine, Im- 
perial Russian Consul General in Constantinople, 
formerly occupying similar positions in various parts 
of Persia and Turkey. To the average reader, 
M. Ponafidine's account of " Life in the Moslem 
East " a laudably descriptive title will afford 
constant instruction and lively entertainment. Every 
reviewer will especially commend the chapters that 
deal with the position of women, the Arab horse in 
its native land, and law proceedings in Persia. On 
the other hand, the student will note various annoy- 
ing inaccuracies, especially in the details of early 
Mohammedan history ; while the punctilious advo- 
cate of pure English and scrupulous proof-reading 
must pencil many regrettable slips, which may be 
explained in part by the distance separating the 
translator, Madame Emma Cochran Ponafidine, from 
the publishers. The book contains over four hundred 
generous pages of clear type, and more than forty 
excellent illustrations. (Dodd, Mead & Co.) 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

" The Energies of Man," by William James, appears 
without alteration but in a new edition with the imprint 
of Moffat, Yard & Co. The essay, which originally 
appeared in " The American Magazine," has been re- 
printed in " Memories and Studies," but will no doubt 
find a welcome among readers in this convenient and 
acceptable form. 

The handsome " Memorial Edition " of Meredith, 
published by Messrs. Scribner, has just been completed 
by the publication of a volume of " Various Readings 
and Bibliography." In completeness and attractive- 
ness, this imposing set of twenty-seven volumes at once 
takes its place among the chief definitive editions of 
modern writers. 

The " Dictionary of Christian Biography and Litera- 
ture " which Messrs. Little, Brown & Co. publish hi a 
volume of more than a thousand two-column pages 
is edited by Dean Henry Wace and Dean William C. 



Piercy. It is a revision of the work in four volumes 
which has been a standard for reference since its 
original publication more than a quarter of a century 
ago. It is a work which has enlisted a high quality of 
English scholarship in its preparation, and which, in its 
present convenient form, should considerably enlarge 
its field of usefulness. 

The latest volumes in the "Eclectic English Classics " 
of the American Book Co. are as follows: "The Mer- 
chant of Venice," edited by Mr. Gilbert S. Blakely; 
Carlyle's essay on Burns, edited by Mr. Edwin L. 
Miller; and George Eliot's "Silas Marner," edited by 
Miss May McKitrick. These are all carefully prepared 
and inexpensive texts. 

Thackeray's "English Humorists," edited by Pro- 
fessor Stark Young, is published in the " Standard En- 
glish Classics " by Messrs. Ginn & Co. The editor has 
adopted a new and happy principle of annotation, which 
he describes as having for its purpose "to increase 
rather than to satisfy the reader's curiosity." To this 
series is also added a school edition of " Hamlet," with 
H. N. Hudson's commentary. 

The third group of volumes in Messrs. Holt's "Home 
University Library of Modern Knowledge " will contain 
Professor F. L. Paxson's "The Civil War," which is 
the first of a five- volume series on American History to 
consist of volumes on "The Colonial Period," "The 
Wars with England," "From Jefferson to Lincoln," 
" The Civil War," and " Reconstruction and Union," 
each specially written for the layman by an authority. 

The "Matzke Memorial Volume" published by 
Stanford University contains two important papers by 
Matzke himself and a dozen contributions by his col- 
leagues, now brought together as a tribute to his mem- 
ory. Gaston Paris is the subject of one of the essays 
by Matzke, while the other is entitled " The Develop- 
ment and Present Status of Romanic Dialectology." 
Of the remaining contents, the most interesting occupies 
a single page only, being a bit of the " Purgatorio " 
from the translation upon which Mr. Melville B. Ander- 
son has been engaged for many years. If we may judge 
from this specimen, the completed translation (which is 
in terza rima) will take very high rank among the English 
versions of the Sacred Poem. 

" The Cambridge Manuals of Science and Literature " 
(Putnam) are described by the publishers as "a series 
of small volumes . . . dealing with various aspects of 
thought, and with the results of recent discoveries, in 
a form acceptable to educated readers in general." 
Examination of the dozen or more volumes now at 
hand bears out the accuracy of this description, and 
reveals the fact that competent hands have been at 
work in their preparation. The volumes are perhaps 
half as large as those of the similar " Home University 
Library," also recently undertaken. Among the more 
interesting or timely of the volumes now published are 
these : " Early Religious Poetry of the Hebrews," by 
Dr. E. E. Kin^; " The History of the English Bible," 
by Dr. John Brown ; " An Introduction to Experimen- 
tal Psychology," by Dr. Charles S. Myers; "English 
Dialects," by Dr. W. W. Skeat; and "Aerial Locomo- 
tion," by Messrs. E. H. Harper and Allan Ferguson. 
Promising titles in preparation are these: "Goethe in 
the Twentieth Century," by Professor J. G. Robertson; 
"The Icelandic Sagas," by Dr. W. A. Craigie; "Life 
in the Medieval University," by Mr. R. S. Rait; and 
" Discovery in Greek Lands," by Mr. F. H. Marshall.

THE DIAL, 



[Jan. 16, 



NOTK-. 



The " Irish Folk History Plays " of Lady Gregory 
are toon to be published in two volumes by Messrs. 
Putnam. 

Mr. L. P. Jacks, editor of "The Hibbert Journal " and 
author of " Mad Shepherds," will publish next month 
through Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. a volume entitled 
"Among the Idol Makers." 

An extended biography of the late Henry Demarest 
Lloyd, prepared by his sister, Miss Caro Lloyd, is one 
of the most welcome announcements of the new year. 
Messrs. Putnam are to publish the work, in two 
volumes. 

Mr. A. E. Gallatin, author of " Whistler's Art Dicta 
and Other Essays," will publish immediately through 
John Lane Company a volume of similar character 
entitled "Whistler's Pastels and Other Modern 
Profiles," 

An article on Charles Dickens and Women " will 
be contributed to the February issue of " Lippincott's 
Magazine," by the late Henry Snowden Ward, Secre- 
tary of the Dickens Fellowship in England and a lec- 
turer of wide popularity. 

Through an arrangement with Tolstoy's heirs, Messrs. 
Dodd, Mead & Co. will publish the authorized American 
editions of several posthumous works by the great Rus- 
sian. These writings consist of two novels entitled 
" Hadji M ur:iil " and " The Forged Coupon," and three 
volumes of miscellaneous short stories and plays. 

The Socle* te* des Gens de Lett res of France announces 
that it has appointed Mr. Frank Allen its representative 
in the United States. Members and associates of the 
Society who have copyrighted French books in this 
country since 1909 are requested to send Mr. Allen a 
list and copies of these works. His address is 84 Mercer 
Avenue, Plainfield, N. J. 

The English Journal," devoted to the interests of 
the English teachers of America, will make its appear- 
ance immediately from the University of Chicago Press. 
The managing editor is Mr. James Fleming Hosic, who 
will have the assistance of ten associate and advisory 
editors. The Journal will appear monthly, with the ex- 
ception of July and August. 

The most important contribution thus far announced 
to the Dickens centenary is a volume entitled " Dickens 
as Editor," made up of four hundred hitherto unpub- 
lished letters of the novelist. Mr. R. C. Lehman, the 
editor of " Punch," edits this volume, which deals of 
course with Dickens's connection with " Household 
Words." The Sturgis & Walton Co. will publish the 
book on February 7 Dickens's birthday. 

Nathaniel Hawthorne is at last to have a monument 
commensurate (in physical proportions, at least) with 
bis far-reaching fame. A heroic statue of the romancer 
is planned for the city of Salem, and it is hoped to raise 
fifty thousand dollars with which to pay for it. Of this 
amount twelve thousand dollars has already been se- 
cured by the committee, of which no less a personage 
than Mr. Kudyard Kipling (now Sir Rudyard) is vice- 
president. 

The first number of the first volume of The Kim 

Tree Press," a quarterly publication descriptive of 

those artistic products of the printer's art which come 

from the book-making establishment at Woodstock, 

rmont, gives illustrative descriptions of "The Hun- 



dred Riddles of Symphosius," " Horace for Modern 
Readers," "The Letters of Horace," FitzGerald's 
"Agamemnon," the " Pervigiliuin Yeneris," "Copa: 
The Hostess of the Inn," Torrey's " Intellectual Torch." 
"The Librarian's Series" (six volumes), and Mr. 
Dana's " Modern American Library Economy." The 
bibliophile and the librarian are especially appealed to 
by these choice examples of book- malting. 

A living link with Charles Lamb exists in the person 
of Dr. Augustus Jessopp, of Norwich, England, a re- 
tired parish priest, and a man of letters Dr. Jessopp, 
as a little boy, was walking one day with his father in 
the village of Enfield, when a small man in exiguous 
hose and shabby dress-coat drew nigh. Stopping to talk 
with Jessopp senior, the slender pedestrian patted the 
boy's head as he conversed, and then passed on. " Do 
you know who that was ? " asked the father, of his 
unconsciously immortalized son. "That was Charles 
Lamb." Dr. Jessopp is now in his eighty-eighth year, 
and can recall incidents in his acquaintance with Tenny- 
son, Browning, George Meredith, and other Victorian 
notabilities. 

" Home Progress " is the title of a series of reading 
courses, projected by Houghton Mitllin Co., having for 
its purpose the advancement of health, education, and 
ideals in the home. The courses include a wide range 
of topics, every one intimately and definitely related to 
the enrichment of family life. Each year the course is 
devoted to a single subject, the intelligent understand- 
ing of which is necessary to the happiness and well- 
being of the home. The subject of the course thi> 
year is the health, the mental training, and the moral 
guidance of children. The courses are conducted by 
means of an illustrated bi-monthly magazine and the use 
of three specified books each year. The enterprise de- 
serves and will doubtless find a large field of iisefuness. 

The Ontario Library Association publishes, through 
the Ontario Department of Education, " A Selected KiM 
of Books for Boys and Girls, Recommended by the 
Ontario Library Association for Purchase by the Public 
Libraries of this Province." This list supplements a 
larger similar work issued in 1906, and therefore con- 
fines itself to books published since that date, up to tin- 
end of 1910. Further supplements will appear at in- 
tervals. The selections have been carefully made by 
persons of judgment, and the economy enforced upon 
all public libraries has been as far as possible consulted 
in drawing up the list. Publishers and prices are 
named in all instances. It is a useful list for any 
library desirous of keeping abreast of the times in books 
for the young. 

The dedication of the new St. Louis Public Library, 
a building representing an outlay of a million and a 
half dollars, one-third of the amount coming from Mr 
Carnegie's apparently inexhaustible library fund, took 
place on the sixth of this month, with Mr. Herbert 
Putnam and a dozen other eminent librarians from 
various parts of this country and Canada present to 
solemnize the occasion. St. Louis's excellent hi>i n\ 
has long merited a better shelter than that hitherto 
provided, and there will be more than local rejoicing at 
the opening of the new building. Mr. Carnegie's gift 
of one million dollars to the city in 1901 has already 
been partly spent in erecting six branch libraries, and 
others will follow, one-half of this gift being devoted 
to this object, and the other half, as above indicated, to 
the central building just completed.

ting the personalities of the chief figures.

scribed, special attention being given to The Balance of Power,

1912.] THE DIAL 67 

The Unpublished Works of 
Count Leo Tolstoy 

Publication in the United States Authorized by Arrangement 

with His Heirs 

IT is said that in his later years Tolstoy convinced himself that it was wrong to write fiction, and his 
duty to devote his whole energy to the expression of social, political, and moral ideas. Nevertheless, 
there were times when the instincts, the habits, and the genius of this master story-teller were too 
strong for his scruples, and he surrendered himself with unspeakable delight to the telling of tales. 
Wonderful stories, they are, too, founded, some of them, upon a great crisis of his life; others upon his 
own intimate family experiences ; and they are told as only this giant among the novelists of the last 
century can tell them. But, although written, they were never published, the author resolutely sup- 
pressing all temptation to give them to the world. With his death, however, the ban was lifted, and 
in " HADJI MURAD," the latest novel by the author of " Anna Kare'nina," " Resurrection," etc., and 
in the other volumes there is presented to the American public for the first time the fruit of Tolstoy's 
ripe old age. 

HADJI MURAD A Novel 

This remarkable novel centres around an intrepid Tartar chief, one Hadji Murad, a character whom Tolstoy knew 
personally, and who made a great impression upon him. The grim old warrior is wonderfully portrayed. " Hadji 
Murad " will occupy an important place in the world's recent fiction as the first novel by Tolstoy to be published 
since "Resurrection," and the last written by this master hand. Frontispiece. I2mo. $1.20 net. Postpaid $1.30. 

THE FORGED COUPON and Other Stories 

The extraordinary results of an action apparently unimportant form the basis of "The Forged Coupon." In 
Tolstoy's inimitably lifelike manner are shown the logical and inevitable consequences, each attached to the other 
like a train of cars, of one bad action. Frontispiece. I2mo. $1.25 net. Postpaid $1.37. 

FATHER SERGIUS and Other Stories 

Father Sergius is one of those not infrequent figures in monastic tales, a courtier turned monk. How his hunger 
for perfection drives him from a Guard regiment and a life of ease to a monastery, thence to a hermitage, and 
finally out into the world forms one of those grimly realistic stories in which Tolstoy liked to convey his philoso- 
phy of life. Frontispiece. 12mo. $1.25 net. Postpaid $1.37. 

THE MAN WHO WAS DEAD (The Living Corpse) and 
THE CAUSE OF IT ALL. Two Plays. 

Around the situation caused by the disappearance of a man who prefers to drop out of sight rather than stand 
between the love of his wife and his best friend for each other, Tolstoy weaves the beliefs of his later years. This 
play is a marvellous appeal for faith in the natural man, unspoiled by social prejudices, unconstrained by legal 
institutions, living, doing, sacrificing out of a wise, generous, discerning soul. 

12mo. Gilt top. $1.20 net. Postpaid $1.30. 

THE LIGHT THAT SHINES IN DARKNESS A Play 

Certainly to all students of the life, teachings, and character of Tolstoy this drama is one of the most interesting 
of all his productions. For it is nothing more nor less than a complete expose 1 of Tolstoy's own difficulties in trying 
to follow his ideals against the will of his family. \2rno. Gilt top. $1.20 net. Postpaid $1.30.

THE FUTURE OF LIBRARY SCIENCE. 



Has library management attained, in theory 
if not yet in practice, something like perfection, 
so that in the future little can be expected in 
the way of further development? To the regu- 
lar attendant at library conferences, with their 
unavoidable discussions and rediscussions of old 
questions, and with their increasingly minute 
subdividing of the larger themes of interest in 
order to find some few details that have not yet 
been talked about and written about to the point 
of exhaustion, it may occasionally seem as if 
there were henceforth nothing to be done but to 
go back to one's, post and stay there, doggedly 
keeping at the daily task of giving out books, 
answering questions, guiding the seeker for 
knowledge, and in general making the library 
under one's care as useful as possible to the 
greatest possible number of persons. 

In any such moment of weariness, when library 
parliaments are inclined to appear flat, stale, and 
unprofitable, there is refreshment and stimulus 
in a backward glance at the progress of inven- 
tion and discovery, and in a brief contemplation 
of the curious and unexpected twists and turns 
that progress has taken. What soon arrests one's 
attention is that the most important discoveries 
have commonly been made in fields every square 
inch of which had seemed at the time to be per- 
fectly familiar to mankind. To take a well- 
known example, the ordinary lock used on doors 
had been in use, with no radical modification, 
from the time of the early Egyptians up to the 
middle of the last century before it had occurred 
to anyone that the key of conventional pattern, 
with its cumbrous shank and other points of 
awkwardness, was quite unnecessarily clumsy. 
Then Linus Yale gave to the world a lock that 
could be operated with a tiny strip of notched 
metal, and even a lock that needed no key at 
all, but onlya memory for a simple combination 
of numbers. Again, it was thought in England 
that the limit of rapid transit had been reached 
when the London and Edinburgh mail-coach 
service of Johnson's time was so perfected that 
serious apprehensions were entertained lest such 
a rate of speed should prove injurious to the 
traveller's health. But in little more than a 
century the world was to regard even the steam 
locomotive as a comparatively slow, old-fash-

ioned, uneconomical, and altogether faulty piece 
of mechanism, sure to be superseded in the near 
future. 

A cursory review of the history of mathe- 
matics a science which Mr. Dewey has so 
brilliantly applied in one important branch of 
library work shows strikingly how the most 
epoch-making discoveries have a way of occur- 
ring where there had before seemed the least 
possibility of them. To the mathematicians of 
the third century B. c., and indeed to subsequent 
mathematicians down to the seventeenth cen- 
tury A. i)., Euclid probably seemed to have said 
the last word on the subject of geometry ; and 
then, one fortunate morning, as the philosopher 
Descartes was lying awake in bed, there 
flashed upon him the idea of determining the 
position of a point by its linear coordinates, 
and the new field of coordinate geometry was 
opened, with its beautiful revelation of an 
unsuspected blood-relationship, so to speak, 
between the properties of number and those of 
space. Before that time, not the faintest con- 
ception of the modern science of higher mathe- 
matics could have been had even by expert 
mathematicians. Another instance suggests it- 
self : Menaechmus, a pupil of Plato and a tutor 
to Alexander the Great, had invented and elabo- 
rated the study of conic sections nineteen cen- 
turies before the birth of Kepler. The study had 
been pursued as a fascinating intellectual exer- 
cise, but without any thought of a possible ap- 
plication to concrete things. Also the science 
of astronomy had been brought by Ptolomy, 
and fourteen hundred years later by Copernicus, 
to a stage of considerable advancement, but with 
no understanding of the mathematical laws gov- 
erning the movements of the heavenly bodies. 
To Kepler, who was both a mathematician and 
an astronomer, it was given to fit the two 
sciences together by applying the principles of 
conic sections, more especially of the ellipse, to 
the celestial phenomena, and to announce the 
famous three laws of planetary motion which 
every schoolboy now commits to memory. 

Following the history of mathematics down 
to the time of modern library science, we come 
upon a marriage of the two sciences that re- 
minds us of Kepler's happy application of 
conies to astronomy. Simon Stevinus of Bruges 
published his system of decimal notation in 1585, 
the use of decimal fractions having been up to 
that time all but unknown, and probably not 
even faintly imagined by many mathematicians. 
Stevinus's system was modified and reduced to 
the now current form by the English mathe- 



matician Henry Briggs in 1617. But more 
than two centuries and a half were still to elapse 
before anyone thought of applying this indefi- 
nitely expansible system of notation to the classi- 
fication of books, or indeed to the classification 
of any collection of objects. Whether the happy 
thought came to Mr. Dewey one morning in bed, 
in the days of his Amherst librarianship, or 
whether he caught the idea among the book- 
shelves and while fretting over the inconven- 
iences and stupidities of a " fixed location " sys- 
tem, cannot here be determined, and does not 
much matter, except that it would be pleasant to 
complete the parallel between him and Descartes. 
Suffice it for us that he did grasp the idea and 
applied it, so that some years later, at the con- 
vention of librarians in London at the time of 
the Queen's Jubilee, the librarian of Oxford felt 
himself justified in asserting that Mr. Dewey's 
services to his profession had been greater than 
those of all previous librarians put together. 

To the mediseval reader of chained books in 
monastic libraries, what faintest notion could 
there ever have come of the modern Dewey-deci- 
malized library, with its Cutter author-marks, 
its highly-evolved and yet simplechargingsystem, 
its children's room and story-hour, its branches 
and deposit stations, and, above all, its open 
shelves ! Who knows but that we of the twen- 
tieth century may be living in a blindness equally 
complete as to the condition of public libraries 
of the year twenty-nine hundred and twelve? If 
it be true, as it undoubtedly is, that each im- 
portant invention or discovery of the past has 
made possible an indefinite number of fresh ones 
in the future, why may it not be argued that 
the signal achievements in library science of the 
last half-century have advanced that science, 
not to the faultily faultless state of Tennyson's 
Maud, but to a high plane of excellence whence 
far loftier flights now first become possible? 
One circumstance at least counts strongly in 
favor of such a view. The great achievements 
in discovery and invention have been due to men 
of no narrow specialism. Newton, Descartes, 
Leibniz, Kepler, Copernicus, Galileo these 
were all men of far wider interests than might 
be indicated by the special services to science 
that have made their names household words. 
The " scientific imagination " so essential to pro- 
gress in discovery and invention flourishes best 
in the scientist who is least strictly routined to 
his one chosen department of study. What 
learned profession is there that calls for and 
develops a broader sweep of intellectual and 
practical interests than that of the librarian?

Almost in a literal sense, he is obliged to know 
something of everything, and he is not likely to 
rest content until he knows everything of some- 
thing. Bristling thus with points of affinity, 
reacting to so countless a number of external 
stimuli, the modern librarian should have the 
alertness, the receptiveness, the responsiveness, 
necessary to him who would break new roads, lay 
open new kingdoms, and make fresh discoveries. 
The history of library science, therefore, is not 
a closed book; there remain an indefinite num- 
ber of interesting chapters still to be written, 
which are not unlikely to prove even more sig- 
nificant and attention-compelling than any that 
have gone before. 



DICKENS AND THA CKERA YTHA CKERA Y 
AND DICKENS. 

It is a time of the centenaries of giants. Scarcely 
has the world ceased paying commemorative honors 
to Lincoln and Longfellow and Liszt, Gladstone 
and Greeley and de Musset, when it begins planning 
how most fitly to recall Browning and Rousseau and 
Wagner. Between these groups stand two names 
forever coupled in the thoughts of the lover of En- 
glish fiction William Makepeace Thackeray and 
Charles Dickens. Last July brought with it the 
date which marked the even hundred years since 
he who was to create Henry Esmond and Colonel 
Newcome first made his appearance in oriental 
Calcutta. The present month brings a like anniver- 
sary of the advent of the literary parent of Oliver 
Twist and Sidney Carton, in a dingy suburb of occi- 
dental Portsmouth. Each great in achievement, 
each close to our hearts, it is natural that the men- 
tion of either should call up the image of the other. 
Side by side they ran the race of life, with fame 
their common goal. Each ''arrived" while yet 
young Dickens with "Pickwick" at twenty-four, 
Thackeray at thirty-five with that most wonderful 
example of urban literature, "Vanity Fair." Each 
died in his prime, untimely : Dickens at fifty-eight, 
Thackeray at fifty-two. 

They were alike in soundness, in sanity, in sweet- 
ness. They were about equal in powers of obser- 
vation, and nearly so in imagination. Both told 
absorbing stories in inimitable ways. Yet, as soon 
as one leaves such generalizations as these, the two 
are scarcely more to be compared than are Tour- 
guenie'ff and Cervantes, or Henry James and Mark 
Twain. " It is like comparing the ^neid with the 
binomial theorem," says Prof essor Peck ; while Mr. 
Chesterton's characteristically clever half-truth 
"The world imposed on Thackeray, Dickens imposed 
on the world" suggests that "contrast" is a more 
accurate word to use in looking back across the years 
at these " so truly loved, so long remembered, so 
sorely missed." 

Marked differences showed in their outward lives. 



Thackeray was of gentle birth and breeding, edu- 
cated at the Charterhouse and Cambridge; DickenSj 
lowly born, found such schooling as was to fit him 
for his future in the hurly-burly of the city streets 
and the over-hard tasks of grimy factories. Young 
Thackeray, dabbling in art and letters, let a mod- 
erate fortune slip through his fingers; Dickens, 
when most other lads of his age were yet busied over 
childish things, was seriously at work to keep the 
family together a David Copperfield trying to get 
a Micawber father out of the debtor's jail. Thack- 
eray knew France and half the continent when scarce 
of man's estate, and all his life travelled often and 
far ; Dickens in his later years lectured and read in 
this country, but that is about all of his experiences 
of this sort. By nature and habit the one was a true 
cosmopolitan, the other a Londoner of Londoners. 
As Emerson said of him in his "English Traits," 
Dickens wrote " London tracts . . . local and tem- 
porary in his tints and style, and local in his aims." 

Diversities such as these in the careers and traits 
of the two men naturally were evidenced in their 
literary work. Primarily, Thackeray was receptive, 
Dickens creative. The one, looking out on the world 
through club windows, drew the classes ; the other, 
studying human nature at close range and in the 
open, drew the masses. It was the characteristic 
difference between the shy, retiring aristocrat, and 
the self-confident, even pushing, democrat : the dif- 
ference to suggest the same thing in another way 
between Du Maurier and Hogarth. From this, 
however, it is not to be implied that the Thackeray 
canvasses were done at second-hand ; only Trollope 
among his contemporaries surpassed him in realism, 
and Mr. Frederic Harrison has just borne telling testi- 
mony to the tragic power which was his. Dickens's 
tragedy, on the other hand, was melodrama, although 
among the best melodrama ever written. There was, 
indeed, more than a little of the "yellow journalist" 
in the man who had served his time with the imma- 
ture press of that day. It shows again in his pathos, 
which was wont to degenerate into sentimentalism : 
" There is something of an alien salt in the fountain 
of his tears," writes Mr. Lang. Thackeray's pathos 
was effortless and inevitable, one packed phrase, 
and the lump was in your throat. 

At the opposite end of the thermometer of the 
emotions, one finds Dickens differing from Thack- 
eray as a laugh differs from a smile. One is a mas- 
ter of humor; the other, past- master of wit even 
if, at times, it is " a most bitter sweeting, a most 
sharp sauce." Dean Hole once remarked of "Wil- 
liam Makepeace Goliah " (to give him the name of 
Mr. Quiller-Couch's bestowing), " He said so many 
good things that they trod down and suffocated each 
other "; and scores of instances suggest themselves. 
Walking with a friend, one day, in a street off the 
Strand, the sign " Mutual Loan Fund Association" 
appeared in a window. " What do you suppose it 
means?" asked his companion; and he who was 
really Titmarsh replied, "Why, that they have no 
money, and lend it to each other." At another time,

THE DIAL 



[Feb. I, 



Thackeray chanced to leave the Garrick Club with 
a man who was standing as his political opponent 
in an election to be held on the morrow, and who 
said, ''Good night, Mr. Thackeray. May the best 
man win." " I hope not," came the instant response. 
All of which is ;i.s unlike the Dickensian humor as 
a rapier is unlike a cutlass. Not that a sunshiny 
humor does not brighten many pages of those inim- 
itable works that began with the " Boz " sketches and 
closed with "Our Mutual Friend," but it is more 
often the whimsical humor arising from oddity of sit- 
uation or individual action than the ready and unex- 
pected turn of thought ; more often the broad humor 
of exaggeration than the keen wit of suggestion. 

There can be little question that of the two men 
Thackeray was the finer literary artist ; his style is 
well-nigh faultless. It was by cruder methods that 
Dickens held his readers. On the other hand, 
Dickens was clearly the more sympathetic. His 
philosophy was all compact of kindliness, benevo- 
lence, joyousness ; while throughout the novels of 
his fellow-craftsman runs a more serious note, a 
more didactic strain, with reproof and warning heard 
more often than any promise of reward. Those who 
know the man, and thus never misunderstand the 
satire or the rarer cynicism which sharpen his pen, 
realize the genuinely sensitive humanity which lies 
so close beneath the surface, they feel strongly, 
as has been said by another, that Thackeray " could 
not have painted ' Vanity Fair ' as he has unless 
Eden had been shining brightly in his inner eye." 
Yet even these must admit that Dickens more 
nearly fulfilled the complete truth of Thackeray's 
own dictum : " If fun is good, truth is better, and 
love best of all." 

Though at first sight it may seem a contradiction 
of what has just been said, it is none the less true 
that Dickens was almost wholly lacking in those in- 
definite but very real " feminine " traits which are 
to be recognized in Thackeray's mental make-up, 
essentially manly as he was. Dickens is the very 
type of the masculine, strong in resource, virile 
always. His creative capacity seems unlimited, so 
crowded is his stage with a long succession of figures, 
distinct, salient, memorable. It is often said that 
the majority of his portraits border on caricature, 
and that many are plainly such; that he was con- 
tent to catch a striking likeness by exclusively select- 
ing and exaggerating a peculiarity which might mark 
a man but surely could not wholly represent him. 
Granting much truth in this (for Boffin passes the 
limits of possibility, and Sapsea goes beyond the 
bounds of even burlesque), it remains simple truth 
that only the unapproachable Shakespeare, in the 
whole range of English letters, has given the world 
more " living" characters. One is seldom misun- 
derstood when he refers to a Portia, a Shylock. ;i 
Regan, or an lago ; and in quite the same way we 
recognize a Pecksniff in every hypocrite, and a 
Micawber in every procrastinator, every irrespon- 
sible optimist; Quilp is the personification of 
meanness and cruelty, Chuzzlewit of avarice and 



selfishness. Despite the number of his charming 
creations, Thackeray gave us but one name such as 
these, in Becky Sharp. 

In the matter of enduring vitality, one cannot 
profitably pick and choose between Thackeray and 
Dickens. Were proof of this needed, it would be 
forthcoming in the common delight of nine readers 
out of every ten in championing one against the 
other, though in this same debate Dickens passes 
Thackeray in what the critics call " universality." 
His is by far the wider audience, even though it be 
less cultured than that which sits delighted at the 
feet of him who gave us Barry Lyndon and Pen- 
dennis. However, such weighing and arraying of 
claims amounts to little more than intellectual diver- 
sion. The pros balance off with the cons at last, 
and leave us mindful chiefly of the store of pleas- 
ure and profit which we owe to both these greatest 
of our modern English story-tellers. So rich and 
splendid is their combined output that, if all other 
fiction and history and portraiture of their period 
were suddenly to be lost, they alone could measure- 
ably replace all with their wonderful composite 
picture of the early Victorian days. Lately it was 
Thackeray and Dickens ; just now it is Dickens and 
Thackeray. But we continue to read them both, and 
each continues to surpass the best of the " best sellers." 
We are grateful that two such should have lived and 
written. We apply to both what Carlyle once said 
of Boz: "The good, the gentle, high-minded, ever- 
friendly, noble Dickens every inch of him an 
Honest Man." WARWICK JAMES PRICE. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



THE LIMITATIONS OF A LARGE L1HKAKV for 

even the biggest institutions, like the biggest men, 
have their acutely-felt limitations are made appar- 
ent in a sentence or two of the annual " Report of 
the Librarian of Congress." After referring to the 
inadequacy of the book-fund for anything but the 
most indispensable purchases, Dr. Putnam speaks 
of the Library's inability to compete for the owner- 
ship of such rarities as from time to time pass under 
the auctioneer's hammer. And yet. he says, " such 
material also would be appropriate here; it would 
render a service both notable and wide-reaching; it 
is the customary distinction of other national libra- 
ries ; and its absence from the National Library of 
the United States must be held a sort of reproach. 
Yet with prices as they are, and competition keen, 
we cannot apply our funds to it without neglect of 
the obligations which seem primary and imperative. 
The sale at auction, in May last, of the first section 
of the Robert Hoe collection, afforded a signal illus- 
tration of our inabilities. There was not a single 
item offered, not already here, which would not have 
been an appropriate and in its way a useful addition 
to our collections ; there was not, however, a single 
one upon which we felt that we could justifiably bid." 
Therefore it is to gift and bequest that the Library

looks for most of its valuable accessions of this na- 
ture ; and two such recent donations from abroad are 
mentioned. The Report contains, as usual, a great 
amount of interesting information concerning the 
Library's various activities. It may be noted here 
that the year's accessions of 98,571 books bring the 
total number up to 1,891,729. In another twelve- 
month or so the two-million mark will be passed. 
Noteworthy among the details of equipment, in the 
" Report of the Superintendent of Building and 
Grounds," are the two new bookstacks, for bound 
newspapers and for music scores, and the connection 
of the building with the central heating and lighting 
and power station on Capital Hill. 

A REVIVAL OF THE CHAUCERIAN EPOS, the 

genre of the "Canterbury Tales," is perhaps what 
might least be expected in modern verse. Our lyrical 
turn, and the conquest of this field by the novel, 
are against it. In the last generation, Clough and 
Morris in England, and Whittier in America, did 
something of the kind. Mr. Isaac Pennypacker, 
the biographer of General Meade, in a poem en- 
titled " Bridle-Paths " has, in limited scope it is 
true, essayed the Chaucerian method and achieved 
something of the Chaucerian atmosphere. The plan 
of the piece is this : A party of eight friends, denomi- 
nated respectively the Sage, Historian, Preacher, 
Doctor, Farmer, Student, and so forth, take horse for 
a month's ride. Their course leads them through 
the borderland between the North and the South 
the dark and bloody ground, now smiling in the 
May sunshine, where giant armies contended in the 
past. The daily incidents of the ride are recorded 
the keen zest of life in the saddle, the changing 
aspects of the scenery, the midday rest for lunch, 
the stir and bustle in out-of-the-world villages at 
the coming of such a cavalcade, the evening arrival 
at the wayside inns. And through all, alike on 
the march as at the fireside, there runs a stream of 
talk about the historic scenes they are visiting, the 
heroic personages of the past, or the grave social 
problems of to-day and the future. These pilgrims, 
unlike Chaucer's, do not tell tales to while away 
the time, but they exchange quip and jest and 
bright thoughts, and they read each other brief 
poems lyrics of race, of battle, of love or tragedy. 
Some of these songs "The Jersey Blues" and 
" Kruger " are known, and one of them, "The 
Dutch on the Delaware," has been set to music and 
is widely sung in this country when the sons of the 
Netherlands are gathered together. The composition 
recalls in a way Clough's " Bothie of Tober-na-Vuo- 
lich." Time and place and manners and methods 
are of course different ; but there is the same mak- 
ing of poetry out of the common events and scenes 
of the present, the same disturbed and heretical 
attitude toward current opinion and thought, the 
same revulsion toward a simpler and more heroic 
ideal of life than obtains in our money-grabbing, 
motor-rushing age. The poem winds up with a 
dramatic episode in the Tennessee mountains. It 



seems worth while to call attention to a book of 
verse which, against a background of the vast shad- 
ows of the Civil War, projects figures so vivid and 
real as Mr. Pennypacker's summer pilgrims, and 
gives utterance to so much stern and lofty idealism. 

DR. VINCENT ON PUBLIC LIBRARIES said some 
things worth hearing at the late annual meeting of 
the Minnesota Library Association at Minnetonka. 
The new president of the State University bad been 
asked to address the meeting, and he genially re- 
sponded. From the "Library Notes and News" of 
the Minnesota Public Library Commission we re- 
print a few of his winged words on "The Library 
and the Social Memory." After a witty review of 
the topics already discussed, he proceeded to show 
how the library stands for the continuity of human 
thought, and said : " These are psychological days. 
There is a psychology of childhood, a psychology of 
adolescence, a psychology of advertising, a psychol- 
ogy of salesmanship and there is Henry James." 
And later : " About the goodness of books there may 
be endless discussion. It is the fashion in certain 
quarters to speak slightingly of fiction, and to regard 
the large percentage it attains in library circulation 
as a negligible quantity so far as educational influ- 
ences go. This is manifestly absurd. Good fiction 
is the vehicle of science, history, literature, philoso- 
phy, and ethics. It gives a background for life ; it 
affords material for personal growth. It confers a 
sense of human continuity and makes for social 
solidarity. The very wave of imitation which sets a 
million people reading the same novel ... is of 
vast importance in the fusing of persons into a peo- 
ple." What a work, then, in people-fusing, in nation- 
solidifying, in strengthening the sense of human 
continuity, have Mr. Farnol and Mr. Harrison and 
Mr. Bennett been accomplishing of late probably 
all unwittingly. ... 

THE MOST WIDELY CIRCULATED BUT LEAST READ 

BOOK IN THE WORLD, to judge from the combined 
reports of the Bible societies and the college exam- 
iners in English, appears to be the book that 
George Borrow once peddled in Spain, to the sub- 
sequent delight of his readers. He may not have 
found it a best-seller ; but taken the world over, the 
Bible finds hundreds of thousands of purchasers 
every year. Nevertheless, when a class of college 
students was subjected to a simple examination on 
its character and contents by Professor Rankin of 
Michigan University, some of the answers to the 
easiest questions revealed an astonishing ignorance. 
The language in which the Bible was originally 
written was variously asserted to be Sanskrit, Arabic, 
French, German, and early English. As to what 
the name "Jordan" designates, one student replied: 
" The man who took Moses's place as the head of 
the Israelites." The difference between Levi and 
Leviathan was explained thus : " Levi was the 
name of a man; Leviathan might be applied to his 
doings." The Isle of Patmos was described as 
" the place where the children of Israel were fed

in the wilderness," and the " mess of pottage " was 
confounded with the Lord's Supper. That most of 
the answers to such questions as these were correct, 
one can safely assume ; but that even a few should 
have been so wide of the mark shows at least how 
little familiar in some families are the scriptures 
that formerly were read aloud daily in all rightly- 
ordered American households. 


THE PAY COLLECTION OK PUBLIC LIBRARY FICTION 

has long since demonstrated its ability to support 
itself, even at a very low charge to the borrower. 
At Springfield, Mass., where one cent a day is paid 
on each volume circulated, the receipts for the last 
fiscal year, as appears from the current report of 
the librarian, amounted to $1,336,68, while the ex- 
penditures for books in the same department came 
within sixty-four cents of exactly balancing the 
account. It is further stated that, with all the 
facilities offered so generously to the novel-reader, 
the proportion of more serious works circulated 
showed a notable increase, the fiction circulation 
falling to less than fifty-nine per cent, which is the 
lowest on record at this library. Sociology gained 
twenty-two per cent, foreign literature twenty-one 
per cent, and useful arts twenty-three per cent, 
while the total circulation advanced five per cent 
over that of any previous year. No wonder there 
was need of a new and larger building, which is 
now taken possession of, with every prospect of still 
greater activity in the future. It is cheering to note 
that the final twenty-five hundred dollars needed to 
pay for this new and handsome structure was a few 
days ago generously subscribed by a former bene- 
factor of the library. The total cost of the building 
and equipment, incredible as it may seem, falls about 
twenty thousand dollars below the original estimate 
of $375,000. . . . 

THE HERMAPHRODITE PRONOUN, or pronoun of 

common gender, still remains a desideratum in spite 
of the attempt to introduce " thon " into the language. 
At least one dictionary, the "Standard," recognizes 
the word. On page 1877, first column, we read : 
Thon, pronoun, singular and plural. That one ; 
he, she, or it: a pronoun of the third person, com- 
mon gender, a contracted and solidified form of that 
one" The report that Chicago's estimable superin- 
tendent of schools, Mrs. Ella Flagg Young, has sug- 
gested " himer " and " hiser " as pronouns of the 
common gender prompts the query whether, if a 
word invented in cold blood must he adopted, the 
one already proposed and to some extent approved 
should not receive general sanction rather than 
the newer and less prepossessing candidate. Mrs. 
Young's "hiser" recalls the rather uneuphonious 
'his'n," which with "hern" and "theirn" used to 
be commonly heard in rural New England, and 
probably is still occasionally heard there. It may 
be of interest to note further that, according to the 
" Standard Dictionary," thon was first proposed as 
a common-gender pronoun by Mr. Charles Cro/at 
Converse, the music-composer, as long ago as 1858. 



That the strange word, in spite of its formidable th 
sound foriniiUMe to foreigners, at least did not 
offend the musician'* ear, is at any rate so much in 
its favor. . . . 

Till: RIGORS OK BIBLIOGRAPHY, like thus.- of whist 

as played by Mrs. Battle, are no laughing matter. 
Let no triflers enter the game. In a letter from M r. 
G. Watson Cole to the Committee on Survey of Bib- 
liographical Literature.published in the current " Bul- 
letin of the Bibliographical Society of America," we 
read : " Referring once more to the term ' scientific 
bibliography,' it may be said that most of the bibli- 
ographies prepared two or three decades ago or 
earlier do not fill present requirements. To-day 
something more is demanded than mere lists of 
authors, titles, and dates. Works must be carefully 
described and distinctions between different edi- 
tions and issues of the same date set forth in such a 
manner as to readily permit of verification. The 
description of books is more and more becoming an 
exact science, and I presume it is to this modern 
method of bibliographical description that your com- 
mittee alludes in using the term scientific bibliog- 
raphy.' " Further light on the difficulties of the 
science is thrown by Dr. Ronald Ross, of .he Liv- 
erpool School of Tropical Medicine. He writes to 
the above-named committee: "The literature on 
tropical medicine has become quite enormous, and 
as it is written in about thirteen different languages, 
the scientific workers cannot keep in touch with it 
unless a special official is appointed to study the 
bibliography and bring out regular lists every 
month and furnish abstracts if called upon to do 
so." Accordingly the Liverpool School of Tropical 
Medicine has its own linguistically and medically 
learned bibliographer, and " it appears," as Dr. 
Ross concludes, that the time has now come when 
every scientific institution must have such an official. 
It saves much waste of money and labor in repeat- 
ing work which may often happen to have been done 
elsewhere already." 

A BANNER YEAR IN BOOK-PRODUCTION with 

English publishers was the year just closed. From 
tables printed in " The Publishers' Circular " it 
appears that a total of 10,914 books were put on 
the market, of which number 8,530 were new books, 
and 2,384 new editions of old ones. This is one 
hundred and ten more books than were issued the 
preceding year, which in turn showed a slight gain 
over the year before. In fact, for the past decade 
at least there had been a nearly continuous and 
very considerable annual increase, from a total of 
4,955 in the first year of the century to the above- 
named number of last year. It is further to be 
noted that the publishing activity of 1911 was 
greatest in October and least in June, with August, 
July, April, and December next in order of slack- 
ness. Philosophy and religion showed the greatest 
increase, with science and technology, history and 
biography, poetry and drama next. The fiction of 
the year sums up 2,215 works, including forty trans-

lations, 933 new editions of previously-published 
novels, and four pamphlets. A nation that pub- 
lishes yearly one book for every three thousand of 
its inhabitants is certainly doing its part, quanti- 
tatively, toward providing the world with reading 
matter.

THE WORST-HOUSED LIBRARY OF ITS CLASS IN 

THE WORLD must be acknowledged to be the library 
of Harvard University, the best scholar's library in 
America, and one of the oldest and most famous. Not 
unnaturally the recent "Report of the Committee 
to Visit the Library " dwells with emphasis on the 
need of a new building, a need painfully felt years 
ago, and now nothing short of excruciating. The 
institution that gave to the American Library Asso- 
ciation its first president, and, as long as he lived, 
its most honored member, Justin Winsor, and that 
has contributed to the development of library econ- 
omy as hardly another in the country has done, 
awaits the uprising of some wealthy and generous 
alumnus, or other friend, to endow it with a library 
building worthy of its unequalled collection of lit- 
erary treasures. Two and a half million dollars is 
the amount called for by the visiting committee, and 
the multimillionaire who hears the call and responds 
to it will have his name written but little lower than 
that of John Harvard himself as a benefactor of the 
oldest university in America. 

THE DEATH OF THE EDITOR OF " TRUTH," On the 

sixteenth of January, removes from the journalistic 
world a brilliant and picturesque figure. Henry 
Labouchere was born in London, of French extrac- 
tion, in 1831, and after completing his formal edu- 
cation at Eton he entered upon an erratic and 
adventurous course of life which brought him twice 
at least to our shores, his early connection with the 
diplomatic service causing him to take up his resi- 
dence for a while in Washington in an official capa- 
city. But the tedious flummery of diplomacy soon 
disgusted the young man, and he adopted journalism 
instead, founding the paper now long associated with 
his name, in 1877, after various other experiences in 
newspaper work and newspaper-founding. His par- 
liamentary activities date back to 1866, though his 
election from Northampton, a strong radical borough 
which he represented for twenty- six years, occurred 
fourteen years later. Of course it is as the fearless 
and cynical and witty "Labby " of "Truth " that the 
world has best known him and will continue for some 
time to remember him. 

TRIALS OF THE REFERENCE LIBRARIAN might 
be cited in abundance to supplement Mr. Calvin 
Winter's recent readable article in "The Bookman" 
on "How to Use a Library." Not only are there, as 
he intimates, many bunglers and blunderers among 
those who visit the public library for information to 
be derived from books, but there are also not a few 
visitors who are disposed to make a skilful but not 
quite legitimate use of the library's resources. Of 
course thefts and mutilations are now an old story, 
but less has been said of the thrifty persons who in 



various ways not in the least criminal seek to win a 
profit not exactly intellectual from the library. We 
recall an impecunious student of genealogy who, 
after making large levies on the time and patience 
of the reference librarian, blandly asked him for a 
postage stamp, to be affixed to a letter addressed to 
a multimillionaire, and filled with such details of 
family history as would, the writer believed, establish 
a kinship between the said man of millions and the 
one of depleted purse, and so produce results pleas- 
ing to the latter. The stamp, moreover, was to be 
regarded as an investment which would yield some 
thousands per cent profit to the investor. Obviously, 
the time and attention bestowed upon such "literary " 
workers are time and attention unwisely bestowed, 
though the unwisdom commonly appears only in 
the sequel. . . . 

PRINCETON'S NEW PRESIDENT AS A MAN OF 
LETTERS has won many appreciative readers by his 
recent "Defence of Prejudice, and Other Essays," 
one of the best of last year's collections of essays ; 
and he has long been known to the scholarly world 
as the author of " Inductive Logic." " Problems of 
Philosophy," and " Hegel's Logic," the latter work 
having received such world-wide recognition as to 
be deemed worthy of republication in Japanese, not 
to mention the Italian version of the book. Chosen 
by the Scribners as editor of the " Epochs of Philos- 
ophy " series, he has enlisted the cooperation of 
the leading philosophers of this country and Great 
Britain in making its twelve volumes authoritative 
and noteworthy. His own work, " The Philosophy 
of the Enlightenment," was selected by the pub- 
lishers to head the series. The geniality and vitality 
of Dr. Hibben, who is said to be the best liked and

THE COWPER HOUSE AT OLNEY, the scene of the

by some of his admirers and presented to the town 
as a memorial and museum. This fitting observance 
of the centenary of his death is now followed by a 
movement for the adequate endowment of the house 
in order that its preservation may be assured. No 
loud trumpetings accompany this praiseworthy enter- 
prise; any such ear-splitting note would shock the 
lovers of the gentle author of " The Task." But there 
may be some in this country who will be glad to be 
told, in a quiet way, that any contribution to the 
proposed endowment fund will be gratefully re- 
ceived. No name of treasurer or chairman has 
come to our notice, but probably an inquiry ad-

Olney would elicit any desired information.

there is no reason except lack of funds why the selec-

MB. CARNEGIE AND ST. PAUL (the Minnesota 
city, not the apostle) appear to be in imperfect 
harmony on the subject of public libraries. While 
Springfield, Mass., is rejoicing over the opening of 
its magnificent new four-sevenths-Carnegie library 
building, St. Paul, which needs more adequate hous- 
ing for its book-collection, hesitates about accepting 
the steel magnate's aid toward supplying its long-felt 
want Several wealthy and public-spirited citizens 
have subscribed generously toward a new building, 
but with the proviso that it shall be built with no 
subsidy from the eminent benefactor of public libra- 
ries. Without entering upon the vexed question of 
tainted money, one can safely assert that a commu- 
nity which pays for its own library out of its own 
pocket is likely to take more genuine satisfaction in 
it, and to enjoy a less impaired self-respect, than the 
community which goes begging for outside assist- 
ance. . . . 

AN ODDITY IN AUTHORS' NAMES, which may have 
attracted attention, is found in the chiasmus (if we 
may use an uncommon but expressive word of Greek 
parentage), " Woodrow Wilson," the name of a his- 
torian and statesman, and " Wilson Woodrow," or 
Mrs. Wilson Woodrow, the name of a novelist, short- 
story-writer, and essayist, who has recently explained 
the curious similarity, or transposition, thus : " Wood- 
row is really my name. My husband and Woodrow 
Wilson are cousins named after uncles with the sur- 
name of Wilson and Woodrow respectively, and the 
Christian names Thomas and James; and when 
the boys grew up my husband dropped the James 
and Woodrow Wilson dropped the Thomas. So I 
really can't help my name, nor that I am a woman." 
This is even more curious than the late transforma- 
tion of Mr. Si-ton Thompson into Thompson Seton. 



COMMUNICA TION. 

THE CLASSICAL DEGREE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

All along until recent years the degree of Bachelor 
of Arts has described a college graduate who has had 
several years of study in both Latin and Greek litera- 



ture. This is the proper seal upon a distinctly classical 
course, and upon no otlirr. It should differentiate 
that training which lui-s at least well introduced the 
student to the trra-m. > nt (irccian and (suliordi- 
nately) of Latin thought and c\|irciun. \\ith the 
poetic acuteness of the one and the formal strength of 
the other. These two disciplines have proved thrm- 
selves of incomparable value to regulate, furnish, and 
uplift the mind. 

The obstinate and astigmatic neglect of Greek is 
now reflected in the " conveyance " of its characteristic 
degree to a use which avails tin- ancient and irreparable 
honor of that tongue and which annuls its power. 

We do not here urge the immrnsr mrut.il nourish- 
ment of the Attic language and literature fout 

and arsenal of intellectual keenness and verbal skill; 
nor do we discuss the inferior methods which arro- 
gantly bid to displace these great assets of wisdom and 
culture: but we do aver that the old A.B. is corroded, 
and the question begged, by transferring the word to 
cover the refusal of the thing. 

Gladly we note that Amherst has led the way in its 
decision no longer to confer the B.A. for courses which 
include but a portion of those studies properly pertain- 
ing to a thorough technical school, she declaring that 
to such schools this degree should be reserved without 
invasion or imitation. 

A true and typical college, being distinctly cultural 
rather than technical, vocational, or professional, should 
use the Ph.B. as the appropriate general sign for the 
completion of courses which do not reckon with Greek 
and are mainly occupied with modern languages and 
with English subjects. This would then honestly indi- 
cate an avowedly " modernized " procedure, and would 
ultimately aid the appraisal of its claims. 

There truly is (as THE DIAL has well said) "a hier- 
archy of values in education." To eliminate roiifu>iou, 
a degree itself should denote substantially that which a 
giveu college course has sought and exalted. To rou- 
fer the A.B. upon one who has ignored all the wealths 
of Greek is, to use no sterner term, anihiguous; the 
nomenclature assumes a classical training which has been 
denied. This not only is untruthful to the historical 
meaning of the " Course in Arts," but also it works by 
indirection to Philistinize higher education. Choosing 
nonchalantly to assert that its neological scheme is 
"more practical," or "good enough," let such a college 
frankly apply a hall-mark appropriate to its theory; hut 
let it not abuse terms by borrowing the title of another 
set of ideas. Doubtless a curriculum may eliminate 
Greek, and yet have merit; but such is not a classical 
curriculum in any fair sense of that word. 

There still are colleges where the light of Hellas has 
not failed, and which have the right to be recognized as 
still walking in that light. Their imprimatur does not 
mean scorn of antiquity. Even under the pressures of 
a mercantilist era, they have not retired their ideals. 
Their precept honors them. They are in minority, but 
they are not shaken of the wind. May they hold the 
pass against all Persian odds. If a sincerely classical 
education is not to be numbered among the "lost arts," 
then as one step even the analogies of the Pure Food 
Law " exact that under no specious plea shall the dis- 
tinguishing label of such an education be perverted or 
counterfeited. Let not the declension from time-tested 
standards add falsehood to injury.

MIRTHFUL, MOODS OF A LIBRARIAN.* 

Unlike those amusing creations of his fertile 
brain, Master Jared Bean, Dr. Matthew Gully, 
Master Peleg Gudger, Dr. Simon Bagley, and 
Master Enoch Sneed all librarians of the old 
school Mr. Edmund Lester Pearson, a libra- 
rian of the modern type, is endowed with a 
very lively sense of humor. In this he is by 
no means peculiar among those of his calling 
in the present day, and therefore his clever and 
sprightly sketches in "The Librarian at Play" 
will elicit not a few chuckles of amusement and 
delight on the part of learned bibliothecaries as 
well as on that of unlearned readers in general. 
In his literary and journalistic role as " The 
Librarian " of the Boston " Transcript," Mr. 
Pearson has attracted wide attention by the 
weekly exercise of his nimble wit and frolic 
fancy in the delineation of the eccentricities and 
perversities and comicalities to be met with in 
the library world. From these care-dispelling 
compositions of his playful pen the present selec- 
tion of sketches has been made, with the ex- 
ception of two articles "Mulch" and "The 
Crowded Hour" which now appear for the 
first time. 

Better than further description of Mr. Pear- 
son's book will be a few samples from its pages. 
A chapter entitled "The Conversation Room " 
amusingly presents the difficulties and distrac- 
tions encountered by two scholars engaged in 
learned research at the Blankville Public Li- 
brary. In despair at the impossibility of secur- 
ing quiet for their philological studies within 
the library's precincts, these two savants address 
their complaints to the board of directors. Dr. 
Obadiah Wurzberger begins his letter thus : 

" My name is doubtless familiar to you, but perhaps 
you are not aware that I am engaged in an important 
piece of research in your library. When I state that 
my work is an inquiry into the Indo-Iranian origins of 
the noun ' Fuddy-dud ' and its possible derivation from 
the Semitic, you will understand that it requires the 
closest possible application and an entire freedom from 
interruptions and distractions. . . . The library, and 
particularly the remote part of it in which my alcove 
is situated, has been little frequented during this hot 
weather. Yesterday, however, an invasion began. The 
alcove next to mine was visited by a succession of incon- 
gruous, inconsequent persons whose conversation made it 
utterly impossible for me to work. A complaint to Miss 
Mayhew, the assistant in charge of the library, elicited 
the fact that conversation is allowed in this alcove." 

* THE LIBRARIAN AT PLAY. By Edmund Lester Pearson. 
Boston : Small, Maynard & Co. 



No other part of the building being found suit- 
ably lighted for the complainant, he attempted 
to continue his work where he was, but was 
forced to desist; and then, to fill in the time and 
to obtain an impressive exhibit to lay before the 
board of directors, he took down in shorthand 
the conversation of the frivolous disturbers of 
his peace. The record is highly amusing. A 
similar complaint, similarly reinforced, is trans- 
mitted to the board by Dr. Nicholas Jasper, who 
is engaged in the preparation of the first volume 
of his Arabic dictionary (on which he has been 
continuously occupied since 1867) in the alcove 
on the other side of the one where the talking 
occurs. No reader of the conversation reported 
by these two indignant scholars can refuse them 
his sympathy. 

A personally conducted tour of the infernal 
regions brings the writer face to face with the 
edifying spectacle of the peculiar penalties in- 
flicted on the various sorts of library-abusers. 
For example, of one group of sufferers he is told 
by his guide : 

" These are the annotators, the people who work off 
their idiotic opinions on the margins and fly-leaves of 
books. They dispute the author's statements, call him 
a liar and abuse him generally. The one on the end 
used to get all the biographies of Shakespeare he could 
find and cover every bit of blank paper in them with 
pencil- writing signed ' A Baconian.' He usually began 
with the statement : ' The author of this book is a pig- 
headed fool.' The man next to him believed that the 
earth is flat, and he aired that theory so extensively 
with a fountain-pen that he ruined about two hundred 
dollars' worth of books. They caught him and put 
him in jail for six months, but he will have to take his 
medicine here just the same." 

The " medicine " for each of these malefactors 
was a certain number of years' exercise in climb- 
ing barbed- wire fences, the number of years vary- 
ing with the gravity of the offense. A glimpse 
also was obtained of the tortures to which " re- 
formed spellers " are subjected in the kingdom 
of Pluto. 

"They were busily engaged in clipping one another's 
ears off with large scissors. There was a sign on the 
hill beside them. It read : EARS ARE UNNECESSARY. 
WHY NOT GET RID OF THEM ? LEAVE ENUF TO HEAR 
WITH. DON'T STOP TIL YOU ARE THRU." 

Not a few old acquaintances, familiar to 
readers of " The Library and the Librarian " 
and of the "Transcript" articles, figure more 
or less conspicuously in the pages of "The 
Librarian at Play." The Ezra Beesly Free 
Public Library of Baxter is the scene of some 
amusing incidents in the book. Miss Pansy 
Patterson, assistant reference librarian, there 
wrestles with tke various conundrums pro-

pounded to her; the voluble Mrs. Pomfn-t 
Smith tries to describe a book she wants, but 
whose title and author she has forgotten ; and 
Mrs. Humphrey Mayo, with the aid of Mr. 
Reginald Kookle, ornithologist and author of 
" Winged Warblers of Waltham " and " Birds 
I Have Seen Between Temple Place and Boyl- 
ston Street," labors at the identification of a 
feathered biped which she has rau^ht a glimpse 
of in the shrubbery of her lawn and which 
finally turns out to be the gallina domestica. 

Some bits of verse, both quoted and original, 
give variety to the book's contents. From Mr. 
Pearson's own pen we quote the beginning and 
the end of a two-page ode "To a Small Library 
Patron." 

" Uncombed, a bit unwashed, with freckled face, 
And slowly moving jaws implying gum ; 
A decade's meager dignity of years 
Upon your head your only passports these, 
All unconcerned you enter Fairyland! 

" For here dwell monstrous Jinn, and great birds fly 
Through haunted valleys sown with diamonds. 
Here Rumpelstiltskin hides his secret name, 
The talking Flounder comes at beck and call, 
The King of Lilliput reviews his troops, 
The Jabberwock and Bandersnatch cavort, 
And mice and pumpkin change to coach and four. 

" But you with towsled head and stockings torn, 
Irreverent and calm and unabashed, 
Intent on swiping Billy Johnson's cap 
You pass the magic portal unaware, 
And, careless, saunter into lands of gold." 

Most heartily is Mr. Pearson's book to be com- 
mended as a cure for that malady not so very 
uncommon among librarians, and not wholly un- 
known outside of libraries, taking oneself too 
seriously. PERCY F. BICKNELL. 



MAKING L.IFE IN A TEST TUBE.* 

Every science has in it at least one grand 
problem which can never be solved to the satis- 
faction of all mankind. After such a question 
has been settled in a way which appears final 
to the great majority of normal persons, there 
always remains a small, but wonderfully ingen- 
ious and persistent, residue who absolutely refuse 
to regard the matter as at all closed. Driven 
by an intellectual zeal which must compel our 
admiration, however misguided we may suppose 
it to be, these delightful " paradoxers" proceed 
perennially to iv-solvr the |>rol>lem. So it admits

of no doubt that as long as the world exists some 
perverse souls will invent perpetual-motion ma- 
chines, while others will square the circle. In 
biology it is "spontaneous generation " which 
will engage the attention of unappreciated genius 
down through the ages. 

In common with all problems of this class, 
spontaneous generation appeals by its beauti- 
fully irrefragable logic. The most orthodox and 
conservative of biologists will admit that at some 
time in the history of this planet living substance 
must have been synthesized from non-living in- 
organic matter. But if it happened so once, why 
not again? Who can say that somewhere in the 
inconceivable manifoldness of environmental 
conditions which exists upon this earth there 
may not be going on to-day and every day this 
change from the lifeless to the living, without 
the intermediation of already living sultancr ' 
Obviously nobody can make such an affirmation ; 
and the spontaneous generationist is logically 
triumphant, as indeed he must always be. In 
this thought lies the ignis fatuus which lures 
him on and on to never-ceasing labor, done with 
all the painstaking care and vigorous scientific 
precautions against error which the most exact- 
ing critic could demand. 

Just here is one of the most curious paradoxes 
in this whole subject of the abnormal psychology 
of science. For while our friend the independ- 
ent is invariably successful in his researches 
if we accept his valuation of the results, such 
an outcome never satisfies him, but on the con- 
trary he is impelled to do the same thing over 
and over again. Who ever heard of a circle- 
squarer stopping after he had once, by his own 
token, reached his goal ? Or who, having once 
brewed an homunculus in a beaker, was ever 
known to rest upon the laurels of so glorious 
(if true) an achievement? This ceaseless and 
feverish pursuit of the same object, which is so 
characteristic of the scientific odd fellow, is in 
marked contrast to the methods of his more 
ordinary colleague. When the latter makes a 
discovery, and convinces himself that his conclu- 
sions are correct, he publishes the results and 
stops working on that part'x-ulor thing. In the 
sure conviction that he is right, he is satisfied 
to leave it to other men, even to posterity, to 
repeat and test his observations ; for him a new 
goal has come in sight. Not so the paradox . i : 
he trots gaily and ever more briskly around the 
same old logical circle. Is it because of this 
circularity of occupation that an unfeeling world 
has come to call him a "crank"? 

A belief in the occurrence, either regularly

or occasionally, of a spontaneous generation of 
living material from non-living was quite gen- 
eral down to the time of Louis Pasteur. He 
showed, by a series of brilliantly conceived 
and rigorously executed experiments, which laid 
the foundation of the science of bacteriology, 
that whenever such measures were taken as to 
insure absolutely that no living organism re- 
mained in a particular spot and that no living 
organism could get to that spot from the outside 
world, then nothing living ever appeared there, 
regardless of the nature of the place itself or of 
the surrounding conditions. About ten years 
after these results were announced a young 
English physician, Dr. H. Charlton Bastian, in 
1870, published his first work in support of the 
doctrine of the de novo origin of living things 
in infusions. We have now before us for re- 
view his latest (one certainly hopes not his last) 
contribution to the subject. During all this 
long period he has not devoted himself exclu- 
sively to this matter, but has made for himself 
a distinguished name and place as a physician. 
In 1898, however, he retired from active pro- 
fessional work, and began once more the pur- 
suit of his beloved will-o'-the-wisp making 
life. Since that date his output of books on 
the subject has been steady. Each one when it 
appears falls quite flat as far as the professional 
biologists are concerned : it is not discussed 
any more than is the latest perpetual-motion 
machine amongst physicists. But with the 
utmost patience and good humor, Dr. Bastian 
proceeds to write another book, setting forth 
the results of some further experiments still 
more decisively proving (to his mind) the same 
old conclusion. 

The present volume, " The Origin of Life," 
is a memoir originally offered to the Royal 
Society for publication in its Philosophical 
Transactions. That body promptly and une- 
quivocally refused to print it. By so doing 
they furnished Dr. Bastian an opportunity to 
write a lengthy and most entertaining preface. 
The memoir itself sets forth with great wealth of 
detail and the greatest attention to scientific ex- 
actitude, the following charming little mediaeval 
fairy story. 

Suppose you put in a glass tube of a particu- 
lar shape and kind an ounce of distilled water ; 
then add two, three, or four drops of sodium 
silicate, six grains of ammonium phosphate, and 
six drops of dilute phosphoric acid, or eight 
drops of liquor ferri pernitratis ; boil for ten 
minutes (I suppose it will do no harm to say 
abracadabra rapidly forward and backward in 



the meantime) ; seal the tube ; place it on a 
protected balcony facing the east ; leave it for 
six months and then open it. If the weather 
has been favorable and other conditions pro- 
pitious, you may find in a sediment at the bottom 
what Dr. Bastian says are living organisms. 

All this is put forth with the utmost serious- 
ness and exactly as I have copied it. In that 
most expressive phrase of the street, " Can you 



beat it?" 



RAYMOND PEAKL. 



THE LEGALIZED EXPLOITATION 
OF THE PEOPLE.* 



Under the title " Social Forces in American 
History," Mr. A. M. Simons presents a brief 
history of the United States designed to show 
how the wealthier classes have usually exploited 
the poorer, and how our constitution and laws 
have represented from time to time the legal- 
ized forms which this exploitation should take. 
The Colonial charters or other agreements 
were intended to serve the interests of British, 
French, or Dutch traders or companies, though 
at times the colonists themselves were allowed 
certain " ground floor " privileges. The State 
and Confederate constitutions of 1776 were the 
results of a break between the European capital- 
ists and the rising commercialists of America, 
which break brought on the Revolution. Here 
again the men who were to benefit from the new 
regime were not the great mass of plain people 
who fought in or sustained Washington's army, 
but the privileged groups of merchants, fisher- 
men, and plantation lords, and their allies the 
clergy and the lawyers few of whom actually 
bore arms in behalf of their own cause. The 
democratic tone of the Declaration of Indepen- 
dence and other documents of 1776, was only a 
sop thrown to the people in order to arouse their 
enthusiasm, their fighting blood. 

But the masters, the leaders Washington, 
the Adamses, and the rest saw that too much 
had been conceded ; and in 1787 they entered 
into a wide-extended conspiracy to deprive the 
people of the dangerous powers which they 
" usurped " to the detriment of the wealthier 
classes. Consequently we have the Philadelphia 
Convention of that year, its secret proceedings, 
and the frequent attempts of men like Hamilton 
to build a new government after the model of 
the corrupt English system. The Constitution 
was the gift of these anti-democratic leaders to

the States and the people, which, proving un- 
acceptable, was practically forced upon th.-m 
by means of the limited suffrage and the most 
unequal and unfair representation in the con- 
ventions which adopted the famous document. 
When the national Congress, the presidency, 
and the supreme court were organized, these 
offices and institutions were seized upon by the 
commercial and planting interests, the manu- 
facturing and the navigating interests, and 
finally, at the close of the Reconstruction 
period, by the great capitalists the railway, 
industrial, mining, and banking lords, who have 
maintained their power almost unimpaired to 
the present hour. 

This is the outline. The author has read 
widely, both in the sources and in the secondary 
literature ; he has seized upon certain important 
incidents and events and made them prove what 
they do in fact seem to show. The story is in- 
teresting, fascinating in some of its chapters; 
but it is not likely to increase the reader's faith 
in the leaders of the people in the past, or in the 
sacrosanct character of our Federal Constitution. 
Notwithstanding this radical tendency of the 
author, the reviewer has read every chapter of 
the book with real pleasure and sometimes with 
absorbing interest. And with most of the group- 
ing of facts, as well as the resulting inferences 
and conclusions, he is in entire accord. It is a 
well-told story of selfish greed and over-reaching 
cupidity working through laws and constitu- 
tions in order the better to appropriate the goods 
and the values created by the toiling masses of 
the people who have never yet been fairly rep- 
resented in the conventions and the law-making 
bodies. 

But while this is said, it must also be pointed 
out that the book proves too much. The Fed- 
eral Convention was undoubtedly the result of 
a reactionary movement, but it was hardly a 
conspiracy ; the adoption of the Constitution was 
certainly due to sharp practices, and the noto- 
riously unjust system of representation in the 
several adopting conventions was cheerfully used 
or abused. But if the Constitution had been 
the product of a conspiracy, it may well be 
doubted whether even these advantages of the 
" Fathers " would have sufficed. 

During the long controversies over the tariff, 
internal improvements, and the national bank, 
there were again the same conflicts of the in- 
terests, and the usual victories of organized 
wealth against the plainer and simpler people ; 
and the author makes good use of the facts to 



prove that class rapacity never failed to raise its 
ugly head on these occasions. Yet he fails, some- 
times, to show the real significance of the con- 
flicts he dest'ribeH : for example, in his account 
of the bank in chapter fifteen. The national 
bank was, as he claims, a powerful agency aim- 
ing at the exercise of some of the sovereign 
powers of the people for the benefit of a small 
coterie of capitalists ; but the state banks were 
not so bad and so entirely inefficient as a prac- 
tical check upon " the monster " as we are left 
to infer from the treatment here given. 

The chapters on "The Rise of North. -ru 
Capitalism," " The Armed Conflict," and " Re- 
construction " are very interesting if depressing. 
The conclusion, "The Decadence of Capitalism, 
which carries with it the strong sugi:e>tion that 
the laborers the " fourth estate," I was about 
to say are now ready to come to power, is far 
from convincing. Why is it not more likely now 
than ever before that the great lords of industry 
will continue to control governmental action and 
gradually reduce society to a new feudal organ- 
ization in form, as it already is in fact, and 
make "labor "permanently subservient through 
their absolute power of the purse and by means 
I of their elaborate pension system, designed espe- 
cially to break down the influence of organ i/rd 
labor? Are there not already railway com- 
panies, industrial organizations, which exercise 
the essential functions of sovereign powers and 
send more senators to Washington than any 
single State ? Are they not really states within 
states ? And why may they not combine, as in 
fact they have already done, to appropriate the 
powers of the Federal government and to use 
them to their own aggrandizement ? Instead of 
a future Nation in which the proletariat shall 
rule, are we not much more likely to enter upon 
a state in which our present masters shall have 
become supreme? It seems that peoples pass 
through cycles of evolution, just as Mr. Simons 
insists ; but it is nowhere on record that the 
masses have actually governed, unless perchance 
in some of our frontier states of a hundred VIMI^ 
ago. But it is not the business of the reviewer 
to argue, much as he may lament with the author 
the tendency of history. 

This book has already caused considerable 
discussion ; may its circle of readers continue to 
widen. If the older historians of the country 
would ponder the contentions and the facts 
which the author so well presents, it might be 
of much service to them and tin- country.

AX ENGLISHWOMAN'S BOOK 
ON GERMANY.* 



One rarely meets with a more agreeable book 
than that by Miss I. A. R. Wylie upon "The 
Germans." It is the faithful work of a first-rate 
Englishwoman (than which " this planet never 
produced a more splendid creature"), sprightly, 
open-minded, observant ; it is based on six years' 
intimate association with the Germans them- 
selves, chiefly in the region of Baden. Best of 
all, this labor was done in the spirit of sincere 
love for its subject, using just enough shadows 
to make the picture a true one. Along with 
an unfeigned admiration for almost everything 
German, there are frequent and sounding whacks 
at British (and we must regretfully supply 
" American ") social pretence, happy-go-lucky 
disorganization, slackness in education, and bar- 
barism in the things which belong to Art. 

The volume deals with all sorts and conditions 
of Germans, in their days of toil and hours of 
ease ; it shows their inner social groupings, their 
daily occupations, their recreations, their relation 
to larger economic problems. The native tem- 
perament here shown forth holds many fine ele- 
ments : honor, genuineness, order, cleanliness, 
self-respect, progressiveness, thrift ; a wholesome 
balance between Sense and Sensibility. The 
supreme wealth of the country, according to 
this exhibit, lies in Character: Germany appears 
as the veriest refuge of plain living and high 
thinking. 

Touching upon almost every other matter 
within the range of the higher human interests, 
it is unfortunate that the book has no chap- 
ter on German Religion (compare, for instance, 
the prevailing highly un-Christian conception 
of " military honor," so well presented by the 
author). Let us hope that she may give us, 
some day, a full treatment which might well 
make a volume by itself of this important 
subject. 

The aim of this work was not mere entertain- 
ment; it has a high constructive purpose: it is 
a noble plea for heartfelt friendship between 
England and Germany, in which generosity and 
not envy shall predominate. Its appeal is high 
and searching. We condemn all attempts to 
cripple a rival in sport, firstly, because it is un- 
fair; secondly, because it is rarely successful. 
We know that the fittest wins, and as good 
sportsmen we prefer to stand aside, cheering 
the winner, even though he does not carry our

colors. In the greater struggle between the na- 
tions the same principle holds good. The fittest 
wins. Therefore it is above all things neces- 
sary that we should steel ourselves in national 
virtues, in self-sacrifice, in unsparing endeavor, 
believing that if we are worthy, if we have re- 
tained our old high standard, we shall also 
retain our place in the world. Wealth, Dread- 
noughts, spasmodic bursts of activity, defensive 
alliances, and so on, will not save us from the 
future our own fitness is our one salvation, 
and our fitness lies in our national character, 
not in our national pocket. At the bottom it is 
not the Germans we are afraid of but of our- 
selves, and when we have once recovered our 
self-confidence, our justified belief in our own 
strength and virtue, we shall be able to greet 
the growing nation as an ally and a friend. The 
only question is whether that justified belief and 
self-confidence is still possible. 

The pictures are brought together from a wide 
area, and are of good size and contemporary ; the 
whole make-up of the book is ample and gener- 
ous. The writing is distinctly good, the phrasing 
fresh and agreeable. There is a cheery and most 
liberal inaccuracy in the mere matter of correct- 
ness in the use of German words, which com- 
ports, belike, with the general breezy freedom of 
the book as a whole. For our own part, would 
that we might never again see the word Stein 
(unknown in this sense in Germany) assumed 
as a native term for " beer-mug " !

Even before the little-expected outbreak of the

THE THAT. 



[Feb. 1. 



columns, and from them all the reviewer has gained 
information of many kinds, but all helpful in the 
present crisis. 

Largely, but not solely, concerned with China is 
the notable volume of Professor Paul S. Reinsch, of 
the University of Wisconsin. His "Intellectual 
and Political Currents in the Far East" is a product 
of American scholarship of which his countrymen 
may well be proud. For while others have written 
of actions, he has studied the springs of action, and 
the essays which make up this volume offer the 
Western reader an insight into the present thought 
and life of the Orient not to be found elsewhere. 
Three of the essays are concerned with China. In 
Intellectual Tendencies in the Chinese Reform 
Movement" we have a penetrating study of the 
mingling of Chinese traditions and Western thought 
which lie at the bottom of the present revolution. 
The precepts of the classics and of the later philo- 
sophers are noted, the influence of the modern press 
and drama is made clear, and the relative import- 
ance of the Western radical writers is shown. We 
learn that, 

" Departing for some length from the traditional classic 
standards, although retaining the methods of the Chinese 
stage, dramatic authors and actors of the present try to in- 
fluence thought by portraying scenes that have a distinct 
political or social significance, teaching by example and 
holding up the mirror to the life of the present. Liang 
Chi-chao attempted to familiarize the popular mind with 
ideas of political change by dramatizing the reconstruction 
of Italy, bringing forward Mazzini, Garibaldi, and Cavour as 
characters on the stage." 

And again : 

" It is interesting to see how books, which with us had 
done their work a hundred years ago, and which are now 
resting as pensioned veterans on our library shelves, assume 
gain in these distant regions the character of potent revo- 
lutionary forces. Their thoughts, which we coolly study 
and analyze as historical data, inflame the youth of China 
to heroic sacrifice and rash action in behalf of ideals which 
to them are blushing with the glory of the morning'. So 
our now rather sedate friends, Rousseau and Tom Paine, 
experience a new birth and enter again upon a state of 
militancy." 

A chapter on " The New Education in China " out- 
lines the development of the present system and 
points out the difficulties, financial, political, and 
technical, which hinder its sound advance. And a 
third chapter gives the best account we have seen of 
the movement for a parliament, describing each step 
down to the formation of a cabinet last May. The 
remaining chapters evidence the same extensive 
knowledge, keen insight, and sympathetic considera- 
tion and they should prove of invaluable service in 
furthering a better understanding of the important 
movements now active in the Far East. It would be 
extremely difficult, perhaps impossible, for an inves- 
tigator so far from his field to study so difficult a 
subject were he not assisted by men on the ground. 
It is a striking tribute to the extent and strength of 
Professor Reinsch 's influence that throughout the 
entire Orient former students, trained in his class- 
room, have been of service in the gathering of the 
material which he has used so effectively. The 



|-i .-.lit \vriti-r rememhers meeting in Shanghai, some

ployed in the Imperial Chinese Customs, hut ]> rhaps 
even more keenly interested in gathering all kinds 
of information concerning local conditions which 
might be of use to his distant master. 

Very different in aim and achievement is "The 
Coming China." l.y Mr. .Joseph King < Joodrieh. 
This book is concerned largely with the relations 
between China and the powers, notably the I'nited 
States and Japan, past, present, and future. Long 
before the reader has finished the volume he will 
have found many instances of erroneous and careless 
statements, of frequent repetitions, and of arguments 
without conclusions. Of the many errors in state- 
ments of fact and chronology, enumeration is need- 
less. Persons familiar with the recent literatim 
concerning China will be surprised to find, at this 
date, the " Letters of a Chinese Official " frequently 
referred to as the work of a Chinese statesman. Far 
different from Professor Reinsch 's cosmopolitanism 
is the bitter antipathy of Mr. Goodrich for Japan. 
It seems to be difficult for Westerners to see the 
good points of both the Chinese and the Japanese, 
but Mr. Goodrich carries his prejudices to an ex- 
treme. A discussion of the opium evil covers almost 
an entire chapter. We are told that "The assistance 
that the United States can and ought to render to 
China in religious instruction, general education, 
manufacturing and industrial development, railways, 
and all other branches, is as nothing compared with 
what is an absolute obligation in the matter of opium, 
if we are to uphold our reputation for civilization "; 
but nowhere is it explained what the United States 
should do or can do to meet this " obligation." The 
volume contains thirty-two illustrations. 

Two rather exceptional travel books merit more 
attention than can be given in a review of this na- 
ture. Not content with ascending the Yangtze and 
with following the Great Wall from the desert to 
the sea. Dr. William Edgar Geil set for himself a 
third feat, the visiting of each of "The Eighteen 
Capitals of China." The difficult task was performed 
a year ago, apparently for the first time by a Wes- 
terner, and a large volume contains some of the in- 
formation gathered during its execution. Each of 
the capitals is described with varying completeness, 
considerable information is offered concerning mis- 
sionary enterprise and the many signs of progress, 
and many extracts from the local annals or literature 
are given. In addition to seventeen of the provincial 
capitals there is an account of Nanking, the capital 
of the Liang-Kiang Viceroyalty, and of Peking, the 
" Capital of Capitals," which is treated as the real 
capital of Chihli, rather than Paoting or Tientsin. 
Typical of the general treatment is the chapter de- 
voted to Wuchang, which figures so prominently in 
the recent dispatches. The Chinese ideograph for 
Wuchang, which signifies " Military Splendor," is 
given. Then follows a brief description of the city, 
and of Hanyang and Hankow, across the Yan. 
in which are incorporated several local incidents,

and an account of the rise of Chang Chih Tung, the 
great Viceroy of Hu-Kwang. And, finally, several 
pages are devoted to the educational work of the 
local missionaries. The volume contains 139 illus- 
trations and maps of several of the cities, while at 
the top of many of the pages are Chinese proverbs 
in the ideograph and in translation. Dr. Geil has 
again supplied a mass of information which should 
prove very useful now that the whole world is tak- 
ing a course in Chinese geography. 

Different in every way was the expedition plan- 
ned by Mr. Edwin J. Dingle one evening in Singa- 
pore. A trained journalist in need of a holiday, 
Mr. Dingle determined to see China from the inside 
" ere modernity had robbed her and her wonderful 
people of their isolation and antediluvianism." His 
book, " Across China on Foot," shows how well he 
succeeded. Up the Yangtze he proceeded by steamer 
to Ichang, and then through the famous gorges and 
rapids in a small river-boat to Chung-king. There 
he outfitted for his tramp across Szechwan and 
Yunnan to Bhamo, in upper Burma, a stretch of 
some 1600 miles. With the exception of a few 
miles when he rode in order to have the company of 
a well-informed missionary, this entire journey was 
made on foot. At times, for appearance's sake, it 
was necessary to hire a chair to accompany him, 
though never used ; and later he secured a pony to 
be available in ease of need, which, on the second 
day, broke his arm with a too well-directed kick. 
The narrative, written from day to day on a type- 
writer which caused endless amazement to the in- 
quisitive Chinese, gains in vividness over any loss 
of style. It tells of hard marches toward the 
end of the journey through a wonderful mountain 
country with constant climbings and descents, of 
poverty-stricken people, of squalid lodgings and 
wretched food, of unexpected signs of progress even 
in the remote regions, and of the splendid work of 
the scattered missionaries. To the latter frequent 
reference is made. "In all my journeyings in Yun- 
nan I was increasingly impressed with the value of 
the missionary, that man who of all men in the Far 
East is the most subject to malicious criticism, and 
generally, be it said, from those persons who know 
little or nothing about his work." And speaking of 
opium, the journalist who had formerly defended 
the drug now acknowledges his error. " No language 
of mine now can exaggerate the evil, and if I would 
be honest, I cannot describe it as anything but China's 
most awful curse." The very fact that a stranger, 
entirely unfamiliar with the language, could make 
such a journey through the interior of China speaks 
well for the innate kindliness of the people. Were 
he a linguist or an explorer, better equipped with 
instruments and other facilities, Mr. Dingle might 
have given a more substantial contribution to our 
knowledge of little-known lands and peoples ; but 
this was not his intention, and he has succeeded 
admirably in giving us an interesting account of a 
difficult feat, as well as the observations of a trained 
journalist upon present conditions in western China. 



The volume contains 107 excellent illustrations, 
and a map. 

Within a year, three volumes have been devoted 
to the life of the great Empress Dowager of China. 
From the earlier accounts of Mrs. Headland, Mrs. 
Conger, Miss Carl, and a few other favored West- 
erners, some knowledge had been gained of the 
more intimate life of Tzu Hsi ; but now we have 
an account written by her favorite lady-in-waiting 
who served during 1903 and 1904. The Princess 
Der Ling is the daughter of Lord Yu Keng, a promi- 
nent Manchu official, who had served as Minister to 
Japan, President of the Tsung-li-yamen, and Min- 
ister to France. His daughters were mainly edu- 
cated in Paris during their residence of four years, 
and on their return to China, the Empress Dowager 
was so pleased with their talents that she invited 
mother and daughters to become members of her 
court. Thus this western-trained Manchu young 
woman gained a personal knowledge of the Dowager 
and of the court far superior to any available to us 
at the present time. The story is well told, and the 
life of the court, with its constant round of duties 
and pleasures, the kindliness and at times the sever- 
ity of the Empress, and the pathetic situation of the 
Emperor, are charmingly described. It is interest- 
ing to read the palace version of the interviews with 
the foreign ministers' wives, and of the painting of 
the Dowager's portrait by Miss Carl. An incident 
illustrative of the very human qualities of the old 
ruler may be cited here. During the Dragon Boat 
Festival, when all the high officials and members of 
the court made presents to the Empress Dowager, 
" Her Majesty was very angry with one of the wives of a 
certain Prince because her presents were the poorest. . . . 
She told us to measure the silks and ribbons in that tray, 
and leave it in the hall. The ribbons were all of different 
lengths, all too short to trim a gown, and the dress materials 
were not of good quality. Her Majesty said to me : ' Now 
you look for yourself. Are these good presents ? I know 
very well all these things were given to them by other peo- 
ple, and they of course would select the best for themselves, 
and give me what was left. They know they are obliged to 
send me something. I am surprised to see how careless they 
are. Probably they thought I receive so many presents I 
would not notice. They are mistaken, for I notice the poor- 
est the first ; in fact, I can remember everything. I can see 
those who gave me things in order to please me, and those 
who gave them because they were obliged to. I will return 
them the same way.' " 

Twenty-two illustrations, principally from photo- 
graphs taken within the palaces, add to the value of 
this very interesting book. 

Timely indeed is Miss Margaret E. Burton's care- 
ful study of "The Education of Women in China," 
for the future of that land depends in no small 
degree upon the influence of the wives and mothers 
of the men of the coming generations. Such a study 
is, naturally, concerned mainly with the efforts of 
Western missionaries, although more recently gov- 
ernment and private schools for women have been 
established. The development of women's educa- 
tion is described, from the days when, in the face of 
almost insurmountable difficulties, a few frightened 
children were tempted into the mission schools, to the

BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS. 

Memorial! of Ever since the lamented death of 
an A mtrican Prof essor Moses Coit Tyler, of Cor- 
ichoiar. ne u University, in 1900, those who 

knew him have been awaiting the appearance of his 
life and letters. Professor Tyler's daughter, Mrs. 
Austen, has now partially fulfilled these expecta- 
tions with a volume entitled " Moses Coit Tyler, 
1835-1900: Selections from his Letters and Dia- 
ries" (Doubleday, Page & Co.). In some respects 
the work is disappointing. Professor Tyler was not 
a voluminous letter-writer, and many letters written 
to him are lacking in special significance. Some of 
the entries in the diary, too, are not of general in- 
terest ; and the volume would have been more valu- 
able had it been made smaller. The editorial work 
is very far from what we should expect of the 
daughter of a careful and brilliant scholar. Decid- 
edly poor taste has been shown in the selection of 
materials: some of the harsh opinions expressed will 
do no good to the reputation of their author, who prob- 
ably intended nothing more than to let off some in- 
dignation of the passing moment. For example, the 
unfavorable comments (p. 250) on the late Presi- 
dent C. K. Adams, who can no longer defend him- 
self, should have been omitted ; there may have been, 
moreover, something to say on his side. Some pass- 
ages which cannot fail to give pain to living persons 
are likewise retained, while names of persons wholly 
unimportant or of whom only good is spoken are 
carefully suppressed. Not all of the letter or diary 
allusions are adequately introduced or explained ; 
e.g., Dean Huff cut's letter on page 305. A good 
biography of Professor Tyler has yet to be written. 
The proof-reading has been wretchedly careless; 
we have noticed, . g., Leasing for Lossing, p. 84 ; 
Massen for Masson, p. 98 ; Garrison for Garnison, 
p. 217 ; Hexentansplatz for Hexentanzplatz, p. 221 ; 
Wuchsmuth for Wachsmuth, p. 225 ; Luthard for 
Luthardt, Winterschied for Windscheid, p. 226; 
Ostreich for Oesterreich, Gonnerwitz for Connewitz, 
Brodchen for Broedchen, p. 232; Wuendt for 
Wundt, p. 233; Masordic for Masoretic, p. 234, 
235; Brouges for Bruges, Allegemeine for Allge- 
meine, p. 237; Delitsch for Delitzsch, p. 237f.; 
Lindeneau for Lindenau, p. 238; Gevandhaus for 
Gewandhaus, p. 242; Wittheimer for Wittum, 
p. 243; Fisher for Fischer, p. 244; uebergesetzt 
for uebersetzt, und for and, p. 259; "death of" 
omitted, p. 273, 1. 2; Windemere for Windermere, 
p. 298 ; Lewis for LeVis, p. 308. The meagre in- 



dex likewise include* many mistakes; e. ^., Coxe, 
A. C., Bishop of N. Y., for Western N V. ; Hnnt- 
ington. F. K , Bishop of N. Y., for Huntingtnn. 
F. D., Bp. of Central N. Y.: Mucn.iley nr Ma- 
caulay. Typographically, too, the book is hardly 
creditable to those concerned. In spite of these 
serious defects, the volume will prove interesting 
reading, and will be welcomed by the many ad- 
mirers of Professor Tyler. It reveals the growth 
of his mind; the problems that confronted him ; the 
trials that beset his literary life; the determination 
with which he clung to his ideals of scholarly activity 
and authorship. It is interesting to note the differ- 
ent careers that tempted him at various times : the 
Christian ministry; the editorship of "The Even- 
ing Post," in 1874 ; the presidency of Cornell, in 
1880; and professorial chairs at Columbia and Yale. 
One regrets that he did not bring to fruition more 
of the literary projects that he conceived ; yet as it 
was, in the influence he exerted over hundreds of 
students, and in his noble volumes of literary his- 
tory, he left a monument that will long endure. 

Art a an ^ T ' ^" March-Phillips's "Art and 

expreition of Environment " is a distinctly sugges- 
environment. t j ve an j helpful book upon the inter- 
pretation of art as an expression of the collective 
human mind, working under the combined socialized 
force of a national consciousness. The author's 
conception is not new; but as a distinct thesis, 
consistently carried out, it has not received the 
explicit elaboration here accorded it. To most 
writers on art, the art product has appealed first as 
an aesthetic content, with secondary reference to art 
as the expression of the mind acted upon strongly 
by the environment. Architecture naturally car- 
ries the illustrative burden of the theme; since it 
is the most national expression, the most collect- 
ively enduring record, in the language of art. 
Egypt furnishes the first example, and that largely 
negative. It is the tyranny of the Nile that made 
Egyptian culture and its art. Conventional ripid- 
ity of an untrained mind, not yet imbued with the 
aesthetic temper, forced into stone the "mentally 
archaic " immovable civilization. The Greek wax 
art-conscious through and through. Intellect was 
awakened, sensitive and responsive; filled with an 
ideal of life that was essentially aesthetic, the classic 
purity of a Greek temple became and remained the 
expression of restrained lucidity of proportion. The 
Arab introduces an Oriental motive of mystic elab- 
oration, but fantastic, flimsy, transitory. Roman 
dominion appears in the widespread u.-e of the arch 
for all purposes, great as engineering, yet limited in 
originality, and unable quite to develop the arch to 
its possibilities because of the conservative allegiance 
to the lintel construction. By contrast, the ( Jnthic 
expresses the freedom of unrestraint, and the eml.ndi- 
ment of energy striving vertically in every spring of

and buttress, a democratic pervasive movement.

the dominance of the intellect, and the assertion of 
spiritual breadth of meaning. The later French 
expressions of an aristocratic social class, glittering, 
idle, hollow, fatally negligent of reality, are all re- 
flected in the furniture and the art of the salon of 
the day. The thesis seems bare and crude thus 
reduced to a skeleton ; but as carried out by Mr. 
Phillips, the story is full of life and vigor. It leaves 
the definite impression that for certain phases of life 
art is the most effective, the most significant, the 
most illuminating expression of that composite cul- 
tural movement that history aims to fix in an intel- 
ligible record. This seems less manifest to modern 
life, which has enthroned the reason with its prac- 
tical gifts, and drifted away from the larger cultural 
expressions in which the acquired skill of tools can- 
not compensate the loss of the inner sense of a crowd- 
ing purpose, an illuminating message. The value 
of this interpretation depends upon the skill of the 
interpreter ; in this Mr. Phillips is successful, with 
occasional lapses due to an impatience of detail, a 
too hurried preparation of his material. The book 
will find its place as a clear exposition of the import- 
ant view that art is a language of the mind. (Holt.) 

Browning', early *? a 8erieS f f Ur lectures, first de- 
career and livered at the University of Vir- 
later influence. g j n i a? an( j now published by the 

Messrs. Scribner in a volume of two hundred pages, 
Dr. Thomas R. Lounsbury of Yale discusses "The 
Early Literary Career of Robert Browning." The 
primary purpose of the work is to assemble the facts 
bearing upon Browning's reception by the public 
and by the press during the first thirteen years 
(1833-1846) of his practical production. The gen- 
eralization from these facts is, that Browning's wel- 
come was a more cordial one than is commonly 
given to youthful poets; that the indifference and 
neglect which soon followed were largely his own 
fault ; that the remarkable and peculiar revival of 
his reputation during the closing years of his life 
was due mainly to the formation of the London 
Browning Society in 1881 and the innumerable 
branches which sprang from it all over England 
and America. Thus, in the concluding chapter, the 
author goes far beyond the " early " period, beyond 
any " facts " indeed, and enters into the realm of 
prophecy. Although rejoicing that Browning died 
happy in the fulness of his fame, he asserts that 
this reputation was largely factitious, without the 
element of permanence, and not based primarily on 
his writings as literature. Browning is supremely 
the poet of intellectually acute but unpoetical na- 
tures. Accordingly, with a body of young and 
promising students (and doubtless here the author 
speaks from personal experience) it would as a 
general rule be much easier to arouse interest in 
Browning than in almost any other great author of 
our speech. While they are doing little more than 
unraveling the meaning of linguistic puzzles, they 
honestly believe that the interest they take in what 
they are reading is due to their enjoyment of it as 



poetry pure and simple. As coming generations re- 
cede more and more from Browning's day, they 
will tend more and more to revolt from the unwar- 
ranted and exaggerated praise that has been given 
to his poorest work. And while there are poems of 
his which will never cease to be cherished as long 
as English literature endures, poems that will 
carry his name down to remotest posterity, these 
are the very ones that are the least representative 
of him in the eyes of no small number of his pres- 
ent admirers. On the first page of the present book, 
however, Professor Lounsbury absolves the reader 
from acceptance of his critical opinions, since time 
alone can prove or disprove their correctness. What 
he does wish to accomplish is to oust the mythical 
from the authentic in the first eighteen years of 
Browning's authorship, and to set in due order and 
proportion a body of incontrovertible facts. This 
he has done with such a fascinating and easy grace 
as to placate even those of us who would like to 
quarrel with his logic and his prophecy. 

Letters of a The P^** charm of anonymity is

Idle Man," genially introduced, rather than edited, 
by Professor Woodberry, and published in faultless 
style by Houghton Mifflin Co. On the front cover is 
the further inscription, "Familiar Letters of a Bos- 
tonian Living Abroad." The letters range in time 
from 1876 to 1904, and in space (or place of writ- 
ing) from Dresden all around the world to Dresden 
again, but are written chiefly in Germany, Italy, and 
Switzerland, where the writer and his wife are on 
the continual move in quest of agreeable and salu- 
brious climatic conditions and a moderate degree of 
diversion, at a not too immoderate price. The 
"humble loiterer," as the correspondent calls him- 
self, is a Harvard graduate, unmistakably a gentle- 
man and a scholar, an Epicurean and an agnostic 
in his philosophy and religion, so far as he has any 
such, and a most engaging, pleasantly anecdotic, 
humorous-whimsical sort of person, frankly avowing 
his weariness of sight-seeing and his keen interest 
in the cuisine, the wines, and the beds of the suc- 
cessive hotels visited by him in his many years of 
genteel vagrancy. The book abounds in shrewd 
comments on men and events, and occasionally on 
literature too, as where he says, upon the appear- 
ance of "Mr. Isaacs," that the author "is very 
clever ; but his style is not the style of a master ; he 
just misses being a genius." Sound sense, a keep- 
ing of both feet on the ground, a distrust of the 
higher altitudes, a sort of resolute content with the 
Horatian view of life, as indicated by frequent quo- 
tations from and allusions to Horace these and 
other interesting and ingratiating qualities are found 
in the letters, which, by the way, are nearly all ad- 
dressed to a fellow-Bostonian at home. Good letters 
they are indeed, and worthy of Mr. Woodberry's 
warm praise ; but his denying of high excellence to 
any earlier American letter-writers (he says, " I do

biography in chronological order, but he has described 
the man and his achievements clearly and with suffi- 
cient fulness for the general reader. In five hundred 
closely-printed pages we have not only the important 
facts of Webster's career but enough ef contemporary 
events and conditions to give the story vitality and to 
make clear the relations of the subject to the great 
developments of the country during his time. Mr. 
Fisher is no hero-worshipper; he does not present the 
"godlike Daniel" so much as " Black Dan." But he 
sets the man before us in a very satisfactory manner, 
and a most attractive man he shows him to be. He 
repels the slanders heaped upon Webster by his poli- 
tical enemies, making it clear that Webster was not a 
habitual drunkard or a drunkard at all ; that he was 
not a loose liver ; that he was honest and honorable 
in all relations, though careless in the use of his 
money and willing to accept large gifts from his ad- 
mirers. But the author shows further that in doing 
this last Webster was but following the example 
of many of the greatest of Englishmen, Burke 
and Fox, for example ; and there have been other 
great American leaders who have not refused similar 
financial help from their supporters. We could wish 
that Webster had spent more carefully the great 
sums his profession brought him, and had thus kept 
himself out of the difficulties from which his friends 
were glad to help him ; but that the acceptance of 
these large gifts changed his attitude toward public 
questions one can hardly believe who comes to know 
the real character of the man. Another error that 
Mr. Fisher combats is that Webster put ambition 
before duty and shaped his course with an eye to the 
presidency. He did desire the presidency, but he 
must have been very dull if he thought he could gain 
it by defying his own party in remaining in Tyler's 
cabinet when that party had repudiated Tyler, or by 
taking a position in his "Seventh of March speech " 
that was sure to bring upon him the hostility of every 
radical anti-slavery man in the North while it could 
not win the support of the South. The charming 
pictures of Webster's private life, of his love for his 
oxen and for the sea, of his hospitality and his 
friends, are most attractive, and of more worth to the 
reader than the accounts of his triumphs at the bar, 
in the senate, and in diplomacy. Incidentally the 



author indulges in many samixtir flings at present- 
day education, and at the alx>litionists who purHued 
Webster relent !<., ly lirfore and after his death be- 
cause he did not follow them to the limit of their 
theories. Webster is one of the great figures of our 
history, and it is well to have this new biography to 
depict his greatness to a new generation of readers 
and to show clearly that he was free from many of 
the gross shortcomings which political opponents have 
laid to his charge. 

"All men are interested in M..n- 
toi & ne in P^P^on as all men find 
more of themselves in him," ob- 
served James Russell Lowell. Are we finding more 
of ourselves in the skepticism of that great French- 
man, the forerunner of the skepticism of Monsieur 
Anatole France? Or is it merely our interest in 
personal literature that has called forth the many 
recent biographies and critical studies ? It would be 
good to know whether the Essays are being called 
for more frequently in the bookstores ; whether we 
are really "getting at " the prince of skeptics. For 
any study of Montaigne, the many-sided, is after 
all no more than a study in the autobiography of 
the critic himself; to express the whole of that 
varied personality would require all the matter of 
the Essays, even that which seems most irrelevant. 
How can we reduce to a synthesis a writer who after 
a life of introspection could not perform that task ? 
How can we abbreviate, when the very inconsequence 
of Montaigne's pages is so expressive of Montaigne ? 
So it is that no abridgement of this material can 
give the fullest reflection of that undulant person- 
ality. Of course, we must have books on Montaigne, 
if in this age of hurry we are to win for him readers 
who will seek him out in all his discursiveness ; but 
let us by all means have in such books the very 
words of our subject : let the author give way to 
Montaigne wherever possible, without a care lest 
the smoothness of his paragraph- rhythm In- marred 
thereby. Such a book is Miss Edith Sichel's 
"Michel de Montaigne" (Dutton), an admirable 
introduction to its subject. It will give the general 
student a good idea of Montaigne, and a desire to 
know more of him. Packed with quotations, the 
narrative is almost reduced to a setting, the re- 
ferences to the Essays being given at the foot of 
the page. Apart from this, the work contains no 
apparatus for the student, excepting a bibliography 
which, as the author confesses, is mainly the work 
of Mr. Thomas Seccombe. The literary and even 
the historical background is slighted rather more 
than one would like, even in an Introduction; and 
the biography itself falls below Professor Dowden > 
in wealth of detail and critical acumen. But how 
can one do justice to such a Protean figure, even by 
massing the material under such loose divisions as 
Montaigne the Man " and " Montaigne the Phi- 
losopher"? There is more than one man in that 
genius of second thoughts ; and, like every one of 
us, he had more than one rule philosophy.

THE DIAL

Crime it* American Institute of Criminal 

causes and Law is advancing the scientific study 

remedies. o f cr i me by publishing in English the 

more important contributions to the foreign liter- 
ature of the subject ("Modern Criminal Science 
Series": Little, Brown & Co.). It is natural that 
they should include the work of Lombroso, an 
acknowledged leader in the subject. His last work, 
bearing the title " Crime : Its Causes and Rem- 
edies," which represents his mature views and 
gives a comprehensive survey of the field, has been 
selected for inclusion. It is divided into three 
sections devoted to the causes and conditioning 
influences of crime, to the measures of treatment 
and prevention, and to the general conceptions and 
systems of penology which by their scientific worth 
must in the end shape practice. Lombroso is most 
popularly known as the defender of the theory of 
the criminal type as a recognizable and abnormal 
deviation of human variety. His first presentation 
of the subject has been modified by a due recog- 
nition of the many other factors which enter into 
the formation of the criminal and of the distinct 
varieties of criminal classes, some of them close to 
and some remote from the degenerate type. All 
this is well set forth in the present volume, and 
well balanced by the important sections devoted to 
the accounts of measures dealing with the criminal 
and the prevention of crime. In a measure crimi- 
nology has found a freer field in America ; and our 
willingness to try innovations and to feel and 
reason our way to a humanitarian attitude towards 
the problem has made it easier to get away from 
the mere machinery of justice, as well as from 
prejudice, and to face the issues squarely on their 
merits. In this instance humanitarianism, like 
honesty, has proved to be the best and the cheap- 
est policy. Out of the many-sided presentation 
of facts often, it is true, too crudely stated 
and too much isolated from the environment that 
gives them meaning there emerges a clearer 
conception of the nature of the problem and of the 
standards of efficiency by which practical measures 
must be judged. The accessibility of Lombroso's 
volume will prove a welcome aid to English and 
American students of crime in its many aspects. 

Panama. -its The impending opening of the 
canal and trans-isthmian canal as a result of 

its people. fae splendid work now in progress 

under government direction at Panama renders 
opportune Mr. Albert Edwards's volume entitled 
" Panama: The Canal, the Country, and the People " 
(Macmillan). The work contains a narrative of 
personal observations of the men at work and the 
methods in vogue in the canal zone, of the sluggish 
untrustworthy native, of the adjacent republic, and 
of the impenetrable and all-pervading jungle that 
possesses the land and reappropriates it over-night. 
The greater part of the book is of a historical na- 
ture, relating the early history of Spanish discovery, 
colonization, extermination of the natives, and gen- 



eral devastation and misrule ; of the days of Balboa 
sacrificed to the petty intrigue of his rivals on the 
eve of discovery of Peru, of Pizarro and the days of 
the great trade during the spoliation of the Incas, 
of Drake and Morgan, and of lapse and decay with 
the decline of Spain. The author draws freely on 
Irving and Hubert Bancroft for the material ac- 
count of this period. The later period of French 
enterprise and failure and of the revolution and 
birth of the new republic of Panama are related 
from available sources. The author does his best 
to extricate the United States from the embarrass- 
ing position in which it was plunged by the vacil- 
lation and extortionate demand of Colombia, and its 
own precipitate shaping of a bargain with the mush- 
room republic. In breezy newspaper style he gives 
a very interesting and informing account of the su- 
perb work in sanitation in the canal zone which has 
made possible the effective construction of the canal, 
of the splendid esprit de corps prevalent on the big 
job, and of the unique experiment in collective en- 
terprise, in government control of railroad, of com- 
missary, and in fact of everything pertaining to the 
life of the forty thousand souls in the motley popu- 
lation of the canal zone. 



Firt-hand ^ r ' R avmonc l Patterson's book en- 
studies of the titled " The Negro and his Needs " 
Southern negro. (Revell) is a collection of letters, 
originally published in the Chicago " Tribune." Mr. 
Patterson was for many years a well-known news- 
paper correspondent in Washington, D. C. It was 
during one of his periodical tours through the coun- 
try that he wrote these letters from the heart of the 
lower South. They have been revised for publica- 
tion by Mrs. Patterson and an introductory letter is 
contributed by President Taft. Although based on 
actual observation, the studies included are not pre- 
tentious, but are simply readable accounts of condi- 
tions in the South as seen by a Northern man of 
liberal views. Mr. Patterson arranges his studies 
into three divisions : first, the complexities of the 
problem are stated; second, existing conditions are 
described ; and third, solutions are suggested and 
conclusions drawn. Much of the material included 
in the first division is not new to students of race 
problem literature, but the conventional facts in re- 
gard to numbers, morality, environment, and tem- 
perament are stated somewhat in a fresh way. The 
best part of the book is devoted to descriptions of 
conditions actually observed by the writer. Here, for 
example, he makes clear the very great differences 
which exist within the South itself : the differences, 
for example, between Tensas parish in Louisiana 
with a population almost wholly black and a hill 
county in Georgia with few negroes. These com- 
munities are as unlike as it is possible for two places 
to be, and yet each has its race problem, the condi- 
tions of which are very different and the attempted 
solutions of which must be very different. The 
author's opinions are liberal and his statements of 
facts are accurate. The book as a whole shows a

The famous library of Assurbanipal 
in the 8eventh century H. c. becomes 
vean ago. a comparatively modern institution 

when compared with the palace library of Ikhnaton, 
seven hundred years earlier, or with that of King 
Netirikire in the twenty-eighth century before our 
era. With such almost appallingly ancient libraries 
and librarians does Dr. Ernest Gushing Richardson 
of the Princeton University Library concern himself 
in a small book of exceptional interest to all curious 
delvers into ancient bibliothecal history. "Some 
Old Egyptian Librarians" (Scribner) contains the 
paper of that title read before the New York Li- 
brary Association last September, with an important 
supplementary paper which the exigencies of the 
occasion had excluded from the address, a useful 
account of the available sources for inquirers in this 
Held, and a full index to the book as a whole. It 
will add dignity to the profession to have it under- 
stood that, as the writer makes clear, the god Thoth, 
among his many other attributes, was the god of 
libraries, and Seshait was the goddess of libraries, 
or " Mistress of the Hall of Books," as she is de- 
scribed on the base of one door of the Ramesseum 
library, while Thoth of course is " Lord of the Hall 
of Books," on the other. Richer gleanings than could 
have been expected have been gathered together in 
Dr. Richardson's book, and they are all from orig- 
inal sources, through the medium of authoritative 
translations. _ 

r* California From bits of tradition and record, 
dnv* of Robert with the exercise of a little construc- 



steventon. t j ve imagination, pieced out with 
some pertinent passages from Stevenson's published 
works, his stepdaughter-in-law, Mrs. Lloyd Osbourne 
(or Katharine D. Osbourne, as the name appears on 
the title-page) has produced a very interesting ac- 
count of Robert Louis Stevenson in California " 
(McClurg), which is lavishly illustrated from photo- 
graphs, one of them being a. hitherto unpublished 
likeness of Stevenson himself. Of course there are 
numerous other pictures of him, for he seems to 
have had his compatriot Carlyle's readiness to pose 
for his portrait; and there are also many striking 
views of California scenery. Considering that Stev- 
enson's California days all told amounted to little 
over a year, the reader must admit that Mrs. 
Osbourne has made the most of her theme. The 
so-called Stevenson house in San Francisco she de- 
clares to have been never even seen by him, being 
in fact of recent construction. The date of the 
elder Stevenson's death, and of the son's final fare- 
well to Europe, wrongly appears in the book as 1877 
a misprint for 1887. A touching passage de- 
scribes the affectionate devotion of Jules Simoneau, 
the Monterey restaurant-keeper, to his gifted patron 



from over the ocean a devotion that kept the old 
man from selling Stevenson's letters even \\ lu-n he 
himself was in extreme poverty. The book abound-, 
in fragrant memories of " Louis," as he seems to 
have been known to his California friends. 



BRIEFER MEN TION. 

The Wartburg Publishing House has just issued a 
new edition of Dr. R. F. Weidner's " Theological Ency- 
clopedia" in which the text has been presented in tu<> 
convenient volumes, instead of three as in former <!:- 
tious. The author is the president of the Chicago 
Lutheran Theological Seminary, and his work covers 
the whole field of orthodox evangelical theology. 

The latest of several new editions of Dickens put 
forth in connection with the novelist's centenary has for 
its especial feature reproductions in color of all the early 
illustrations by Phiz, Cmikshank, etc., some forty in 
each volume. Considering the very low price at which 
the volumes are sold, these colored plates are really a 
wonderful achievement. Certainly, in connection with 
the excellent print and paper of this edition, they make 
one eager to re-read the novels themselves. M r. 1 1 fiiry 
Frowde, in conjunction with Messrs. Chapman & Hall. 
publishes this very attractive set, of which five volumes 
have so far reached us. 

The Society for Americana, Incorporated, of Boston, 
has recently issued the first volume of An Historical 
Digest of the Provincial Press." This volume deals with 
Massachusetts, and its scope may be gathered from the 
sub-title: "Being a collation of all items of personal and 
historic reference relating to American affaire printed 
in the newspapers of the provincial period beginning 
with the appearance of The Present State of the New- 
English Affairs, 1689, Publick Occurrences, 1690, and 
the first issue of The Boston News-Letter, 1704, and 
ending with the close of the Revolution, 1783." The 
editors of the work are Messrs. Lyman Home \\ 
and Edwin M. Bacon. 

In the excellent "Manuals of Science and Litera- 
ture," published by the Cambridge University Press 
(New York: Putnam), Dr.F.O. Bower,Regius Professor 
of Botany at Glasgow, has a volume entitled " Plant Life 
on Land, considered in Some of its Biological Aspects." 
Each of the ten chapters which make up the volume it 
a separate essay on some aspect of modern botany. 
Morphology, physiology, and ecology each receive about 
equal attention, the whole forming a model of popular 
scientific writing, which the layman will certainly find 
interesting and may without misgiving accept as accur- 
ate and trustworthy. In another volume of the same 
series, Professor Frederick Krrblr, of Reading College, 
summarizes in an entertaining way his studies on 
"Plant-Animals." The particular "plant-animals" 
dealt with are the two species of the peculiar creature 
Convoluta found on the beaches of Brittany. In these 
forms the surface layer of what is really an animal 
body is thickly studded with minute green plants (alg<r). 
The life history and behavior of these creatures com- 
prise a series of adaptations for the benefit now of the 
plant partner, now of the animal partner, and nearly 
always for the mutual advantage of the firm. The 
whole story of these matters is a veritable fairy tale of

" Black and White," the well-known English weekly, 
has been purchased and absorbed by its more powerful 
and popular rival, " The Sphere." 

Mr. Maurice Baring's study of " The Russian People," 
which has been highly praised by the English press, will 
be published shortly in this country by the George H. 
Doran Co. 

Two interesting literary studies announced by Hough- 
ton Mifflin Co. are " Ibsen : The Prophet of the Present," 
by Dr. Otto Heller; and a critical and biographical 
study of Nietzsche, by Mr. Paul Elmer More. 

"Our Judicial Oligarchy," by Mr. Gilbert E. Roe, 
with an introduction by Senator La Follette, and " Ap- 
plied Socialism," by Mr. John Spargo, are announced 
for Spring publication by Mr. B. W. Huebsch. 

Mr. Wilfrid Ward's " Life of John Henry, Cardinal 
Newman," based on his private journals and corre- 
spondence, will be published immediately in both Amer- 
ica and England by Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. 

An entirely new novel by Mr. Leonard Merrick, en- 
titled "The Position of Peggy," is announced for im- 
mediate publication by Mr. Mitchell Kennerley. It deals 
with theatrical life, as do many of Mr. Merrick's pre- 
vious stories. 

" Studies of Children for Artists," consisting of fifty 
heliotype reproductions of photographic studies of child- 
ren up to three years of age, with descriptive text in 
German, will be published shortly by the Bruno Hess- 
ling Co., of New York. 

An authorized translation of the Infanta Eulalia's 
book, " The Thread of Life " will be brought out in the 
near future by Messrs. Duffield & Company. Despite 
the attempt of the author's nephew, King Alphonso of 
Spain, to suppress it, the book is already in its eighth 
edition in Paris. 

" The English Review " announces a reduction in 
price to one shilling a number, beginning with the 
January issue. This periodical has, almost from its 
first number, been the most interesting and enterpris- 
ing of the English reviews; at the new price it will 
also be the cheapest. 

A new Life of Nietzsche, prepared by his sister, 
Mrs. Foerster-Nietzsche, is an interesting feature of the 
Spring announcement lists. The work will be complete 
in two volumes, one of which (devoted to " The Young 
Nietzsche ") is to appear immediately through the 
Sturgis & Walton Co. 

A new book by Sir George Trevelyan will be published 
this month by Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. The 
title is "George the Third and Charles Fox: The Con- 
cluding Part of The American Revolution.' " The 
work will be completed in two volumes, but the first 
volume only will be published now. 

The first of Professor Edward A. Ross's papers on 
"The Middle West" appears in the February "Cen- 
tury." It treats especially of the composite population 
of the Middle West, and of the conditions which influ- 
ence their living and thinking conditions which differ 
in many important points from those of the East. 

Circulars of information concerning the Kahn Founda- 
tion for the Foreign Travel of American Teachers have 
just been issued by the Trustees of the Foundation. 
Two Fellows will be appointed for one year beginning 
July 1, 1912, with a stipend of 3,000. and an addi- 



tional $300. for the purchase of books, souvenirs, photo- 
graphs, etc. The applications for appointment should 
be made on a formal blank which may be obtained from 
the Secretary of the Foundation, Sub-station 84, New 
York City, and should be filed on or before March 1, 
1912. 

Mr. E. Phillips Oppenheim, the popular English 
novelist, has written a sketch of his own career, and 
this, with other interesting information regarding the 
author and his books, is incorporated in an attractive 
booklet which his American publishers, Messrs. Little, 
Brown & Co., of Boston, will mail to any address on 
request. 

The new edition of the American Library Association 
Catalogue, 1904-1911, is being prepared for early pub- 
lication by the A. L. A. Publishing Board, Chicago. 
Copies will be for sale only, at a probable price of $1. 
All requests for the publication should be sent direct to 
78 East Washington Street, Chicago, and not to the Li- 
brary of Congress. 

The death is reported from London of Mrs. Rosa- 
mund Marriott Watson, in her forty-ninth year. Mrs. 
Watson is best known as a writer of graceful and 
imaginative verse, of which four volumes have appeared 
at intervals during the past few years. She published, 
also, two prose works " The Art of the House " and 
" The Heart of a Garden." 

A new record for Higden's " Polychronicon " was 
established at the sale of the second part of the Robert 
Hoe library. Eight thousand dollars was the price paid 
for the exceptionally good copy offered, a Caxton of the 
year 1482. Mr. Henry E. Huntington, whose agent se- 
cured the book for him, is building up a private library 
that promises to be second to none in the world at 
least in point of high prices paid for its rare first edi- 
tions and other literary treasures. 

The Newberry Library of Chicago issues in pamphlet 
form a selected list of its " Materials for the Study of 
the English Drama (excluding Shakespeare)," entered 
under nine heads, with a concluding alphabetical index. 
Magazine articles are not included, as they may be easily 
found through other indexes. The list contains about 
a thousand titles, and forms the first number of the 
" Publications of the Newberry Library." It has copy- 
right protection, of which it seems to be not unworthy. 

The "Iowa Library Quarterly" for the last three 
months of 1911 contains its usual amount of matter re- 
lating to the activities of Iowa librarians and libraries. 
A good paper on " Right Reading in Childhood," by 
Mr. Malcolm G. Wyer, librarian of the State Univer- 
sity, occupies half the space of the number, and is fol- 
lowed by other addresses or parts of addresses before 
the same meeting of the Iowa Library Association that 
listened to Mr. Wyer. Other notes of local library 
occurrences are added. 

For many years the most distinctive and interesting 
editorial feature in any American periodical was the 
monthly causerie entitled " In the Lion's Den," contri- 
buted by Mr. Charles F. Lummis to the " Out West 
Magazine." Since the decease of that periodical a few 
years ago, these virile and caustic utterances have been 
widely missed. It is welcome news, therefore, that the 
department is to be re-established, this time in the 
" West Coast Magazine " of Los Angeles, beginning 
with the January number. We are glad to note, also, 
that a selection from the old Lion's Den " comments 
in " Out West " is to appear shortly in book form.

A Brave Book on a Great Subject 

THE BIBLE UNVEILED 

By M. M. MANGASARIAN 

270 Pages, Cloth Bound, Stamped in Gold. Price $1.25, Postage 8 Cents. 

This is a wonderfully illuminating book. It tells the whole truth about the Bible. 

The book was written in answer to William Jennings Bryan's challenge to produce a better 
book than the Bible. 

The following quotations from a few of the letters received show the reception given to Mr. 
Mangasarian's book: 

A former churchman and a teacher from Cedar Rapids, writes : 

"I again heard you Sunday and have read half of your 'The Bible Unveiled' this 
morning on the train. I felt better after reading it than after twenty-five years of Bible 
reading and Bible teaching." 

Dr. Rufus K. Noyes of Boston writes : 

' The Bible Unveiled ' is the best exposition of the Bible I have ever read. It is 
unanswerable ; its style, force, serenity, lucidity and logic are delightful." 

"Among scores of volumes of Free Thought I have few equal to it. Mr. Mangasarian 
has done the world a great service. The book should be translated into every language. 
It has a permanent value and I predict for it a great sale."

Irish Folk-History Plays 

By LADY GREGORY 

First Series THE TRAGEDIES Second Series THE TRAGIC COMEDIES 

Grania, Kincora, Dervorgilla The Canavans, The White Cockade, The Deliverer 

Crown 8vo. Each $1.50 net. By mail $1.65. 

LADY GREGORY has preferred going for her material to the traditional folk history rather 
than to the authorized printed versions, and she has been able, in so doing, to make her plays 
more living. The choice of folk history rather than written history gives a freshness of treatment 
and elasticity of material which made the late J. M. Synge say that " Lady Gregory's method had 
brought back the possibility of writing historic plays." All these plays, except Grania, which has 
not yet been staged, have been very successfully performed in Ireland. They are written in the 
dialect of Kiltartan, which had already become familiar to readers of Lady Gregory's books.

QTARTING with the present day scientific psycho- 
^ logy, and its emphasis in both mind and body, 
the author endeavors to apply psychological princi- 
ples to the question of efficiency at large. He insists 
on the need of investigating the entire subject of the 
nature, scope, and wise use of energy, and emphasizes 
the power of will, conscious control, and intellectual 
coordination.

'"pHE book gives in as interesting a manner as pos- 
* sible the history of the laws of railway trans- 
portation from the beginning to the present. It does 
not trace the historical development for the sake of

A N able piece of work by a man of independent

urges the Church to turn from the unreal evils of 
theological error to the real evils of organized society 
and to correct the social conditions that are respon- 
sible for the sin of the individual. 


The Child of the Dawn 

By ARTHUR CHRISTOPHER BENSON 

Professor of English Literature in the University of 
Cambridge

AN allegory or fantasy dealing with the hope of 
immortality. The author does not attempt any 
philosophical or ontological exposition of what is 
hidden behind the veil of death, but deals with the 
subject imaginatively or poetically, seeking, as he 
says, " to translate hopes into visions."

With an Introduction by FREDERICK S. DELLENBAUGH 
Octavo. With 86 illustrations from Original Photographs by the Author. $2.50 net. By mail $2.75. 
A UNIQUE narrative of discovery and adventure is given to the world in the pages of Mr. Lange's volume. 
Not only is the region described one that has long piqued curiosity, but the exceptional trials that the 
author endured and the unusual experiences that at every step beset his progress form a tout ensemble that 
makes one's heart throb with sympathetic interest in the hardihood and pluck that finally conquered over the 
treachery of the horror-infested jungle. Few men have been subject to greater trials, trials that rack the 
soul and body to the last notch. But such was the tenacity with which he clung to life that he succeeded in 
preserving himself and in saving the exposed photographic plates which serve to illustrate his story.

A WORD WITH THE LIBRARIAN 



C One of the most marked characteristics of the intelligent public of to-day is its 
interest in the Theatre an interest that the librarian can easily guage by the 
current demand for literature having to do with the Stage. 

C. This tendency deserves fostering on every account. One obvious way to foster it 
is to place before your readers the most original and suggestive book about the 
Theatre published in years. 

C That book is E. GORDON CRAIG'S " ON THE ART OF THE THEATRE." 

C. This is not a treatise on scene-painting, or a manual of first aid to stage managers, 
or a textbook on the art of acting. It is, rather, a series of brilliant and fascinating 
papers embodying a revolutionary arraignment of the Theatre as it is, and a new 
and noble conception of the Theatre as it might be. Its appeal is not to the 
technician but to the layman to everyone who goes to the Theatre or takes an 
intelligent interest in it. 

C. The publishers of this book are naturally enthusiastic about it, but not more so 
than the reviewers and perhaps you will consider the latter more impartial. At 
any rate, it will be worth your while to read what some of them say about it. 

" Here is a man of genius and his book. . . . Mr. Craig is acknowledged all over Europe as a 
master-pioneer in the Theatre. ... If anyone doubts his genius, they have only to read this book 
of his. It is instinct with genius. On every page are illuminating flashes of thought, vista-visions, 
tangential flights of fancy, that betray a mind entirely different from that of the ordinary 
pedestrian thinker." The Nation (London). 

"The book is dynamic. Whether one follow Mr. Craig or not to the end of the trail he blazes, 
this book is one of the timeliest chances that could befall the young playwrights of our own 
country, scattered and unsupported as they are, without a common watch-word. And whether 
this book stimulates to fellow-work or opposition matters little enough. It is bound to shake us 
all broad awake, with the shock and challenge of unquestionable genius." 

JOSEPHINE PRESTON PEABODY (Author of "The Piper",. 

"Mr. Craig's book is tingling with force and radiant with health. It is full of courage, not only 
in attack, but also in adventure. ... It is a vital book . . . invigorating and inspiring. . . . Every 
word leaps from the page with all the dynamic nobility of creative force. . . . He has analyzed 
the evil of the theatre and stated it with a fearlessness infinitely refreshing in these days of timid 
thought, speech, writing, and criticism stated it also with charm and disinterestedness." 

The Observer (London). 

44 If the stage were not soggy with inutile traditions, such a book as Gordon Craig's volume 
would create a revolution. . . . Serious craftsmen of the theatre and hopeful lovers of the theatre 
will take it to heart as a momentous and stimulating volume." 

JAMES O'DONNELL BENNETT in the Chicago Record -Herald. 

C. Here, obviously, is one of those rare books that the librarian must put on his pur- 
chasing list. The price is $2. net, and the publishers are Browne's Bookstore, 
412 South Michigan Avenue, Chicago.

A Brave Book on a Great Subject 

THE BIBLE UNVEILED 

By M. M. MANGASARIAN 

270 Pages, Cloth Bound, Stamped in Gold. Price $1.25, Postage 8 Cents. 

This is a wonderfully illuminating book. It tells the whole truth about the Bible. 

The book was written in answer to William Jennings Bryan's challenge to produce a better 
book than the Bible. 

The following quotations from a few of the letters received show the reception given to Mr. 
Mangasarian's book: 

A former churchman and a teacher from Cedar Rapids, writes : 

" I again heard you Sunday and have read half of your ' The Bible Unveiled ' this 
morning on the train. I felt better after reading it than after twenty-five years of Bible 
reading and Bible teaching." 

Dr. Rufus K. Noyes of Boston writes : 

' The Bible Unveiled ' is the best exposition of the Bible I have ever read. It is 
unanswerable ; its style, force, serenity, lucidity and logic are delightful." 

"Among scores of volumes of Free Thought I have few equal to it. Mr. Mangasarian 
has done the world a great service. The book should be translated into every language. 
It has a permanent value and I predict for it a great sale."

THE CHICAGO OPERA SEASON. 

The public-spirited citizens whose faith and 
enterprise made possible the existence of the 
Chicago Grand Opera Company have excellent 
reasons for congratulating themselves and all 
others concerned in the undertaking. The sec- 
ond season of the organization ended on the 
first of this month, and the receipts for the ten 
weeks have come close to meeting the expenses. 
Based upon the accounts of these ten weeks 
alone, a deficit of a few thousand dollars ap- 
pears, but the amount is trifling when considered 
in relation to the total budget of half a million. 
Even this deficit will probably disappear when 
reckoning is made of certain miscellaneous 
revenues, such as the receipts from occasional 
flights out of town, and from rentals for the 
Auditorium Theatre, which the company leases 
for the whole year. Last year's balance-sheet 
showed a deficit of approximately twenty per 
cent, which came out of the pockets of the guar- 
antors ; this year they have had to pay practi- 
cally nothing for their disinterested endeavor to 
do the public an important artistic service. 

The reasons for this satisfactory measure of 
financial success in what seemed at the outset a 
precarious venture are numerous and varied. 
The competent direction of Mr. Andreas Dippel 
accounts for much of it ; much also must be 
credited to the artists whom he enlisted in the 
enterprise. The superb musicianship of Signor 
Cleofonte Campanini is responsible for a great 
deal, for in such matters as balance of tone and 
unity of effect the artistic results which he 
achieved were maintained at a high level of 
excellence, and, at their best, were almost beyond 
praise. A word should also be said for Mr. 
Alfred Szendrei, who conducted a few German 
works, and whose readings were of exceptional 
beauty. Among the principals, Miss Mary 
Garden was the popular favorite, and her suc- 
cess, although based more upon histrionism than 
upon vocalization, was on the whole well de- 
served. In the chorus, we had a collection of 
fresh voices of a quality to which our operatic 
stage has not been accustomed, admirably trained 
to sing in the three languages which the stand- 
ard repertory demands. The cooperation of the 
newspaper press was unremitting and cordial, 
impressing the merits of the undertaking irre-

sistibly upon the public mind. The reviewers, 
among whom those accomplished musicians, 
Messrs. Gunn, Hackett, and Borowski, call in 
particular for honorable mention, had a free 
hand, and wrote about the performances with 
discriminating intelligence. Lastly, " society " 
smiled upon its new operatic toy, and was mar- 
shalled night after night in dazzling array, thus 
performing two useful functions that of filling 
the coffers of the company, and that of luring 
many thousands outside the fold to become 
witnesses of the spectacle. 

It now seems to be established beyond per- 
adventure that Chicago is willing to pay fifty 
thousand dollars a week for ten weeks if in re- 
turn for the payment it can get the right sort of 
opera. What the right sort is depends, first, 
upon the artistic features to which we have 
called attention, and, second, upon the list of the 
works produced. Mr. Dippel has been highly 
successful in guessing what the public wants. 
He has given us twenty-four works in seventy- 
eight performances, "Carmen," " Cendrillon," 
and I ( i ioj, 11 i della Madonna " heading the list 
with six performances each. Eight other works 
have been given four or five times each. Thirty- 
six of the performances have been in French, 
twenty in Italian, and the others in either Ger- 
man or English. This preponderance of French 
opera is to be accounted for by the endeavor to 
provide the public with novelties, rather than 
upon the assumption that French composers 
count for more than those of other nations. An 
even half of the French evenings were devoted 
to four works of M. Massenet a pretty com- 
poser but not a great one. One novelty the 
" Quo Vadis ?" of M. Nougue"s produced at great 
cost, failed to attract audiences large enough to 
make it worth while, and was withdrawn after 
four attempts to make it go. Among the Italian 
productions, the most noteworthy were those 
that gave Chicago its first hearing of Signor 
Wolf -Ferrari's " II Segreto di Susanna " and 
I Giojelli della Madonna." The former, a de- 
lightful short work of almost Mozartian inspira- 
tion, won the hearts of all its hearers ; the latter, 
which was given its first American production, 
was distinguished by the presence of the com- 
poser, who had come to America for the occasion 
of this premiere performance. Signor Wolf- 
Ferrari certainly had his innings, for, besides 
hearing his two operas, his cantata, La Vita 
Nuova," was also sung at a Sunday concert. 

The ill-judged propaganda which has been con- 
ducted of late by the zealous but mistaken per- 
sons who think that all opera should be sung in 



the English language for English-speaking audi- 
ences drove an entering wedge into the work of 
the Chicago season. Mr. Herbert's " Natoma " 
was, as of course it should be, sung in English. 
that being the language for which t lie music was 
written. But "Hansel und Gretel" is a differ- 
ent matter, and the best that can be said of the 
artistic perversion to which it was subjected is 
that the audiences hardly realized that they were 
listening to English words, and could understand 
only a small fraction of them. It is difficult to 
have any patience with people who would ruin 
the artistic effect of a lyrical drama by fitting 
its notes to a set of vowel and consonantal sounds 
which they were never meant to accompany, 
and the arguments by which this malpractice is 
sought to be justified are too feeble to deserve 
serious refutation. The fact that in Germany, 
France, and Italy, operas are sung in the lan- 
guages of the respective countries means only 
that Europe cannot afford the cost of properly 
equipped opera companies ; in the United States, 
we have the immense advantage of being able and 
willing to bear this heavy expense, which is the 
reason why the performances given in New York 
and Chicago are in most respects the best to be 
heard anywhere in the world. It will be a sad 
day for opera in this country when this manifest 
advantage is given up to placate a chauvinistic 
sentiment. 

The one obvious weakness of the season just 
ended has been its failure to provide suitably 
for German opera. Last year, not a single 
German work was given during the ten weeks ; 
this year, we have had eleven performances of 
" Lohengrin," " Die Walkiire," and " Tristan 
und Isolde," five of "Hansel und Gretel," 
and two of " Le Nozze di Figaro." This is 
something, but not nearly enough. No season 
should pass without the entire " Ring," or 
without " Die Meistersinger," or without " Par- 
sifal." And the most divinely beautiful of all 
operatic works, Beethoven's " Fidelio," should 
be restored to the matter-of-course repertory, 
in order that a generation which knows it not 
may partake of the wonder of its revelation. 

What we have always endeavored to empha- 
size in our discussion of opera is its cultural 
importance as an art- form. For the most part . 
the masterpieces of painting and sculpture and 
architecture are to be seen only at the cost of 
much time and money spent in travel. But 
music, like literature, need not be sought afar, 
but comes to our very doors. It should be pos- 
sible for a student of the history of music to 
hear all of the great masterpieces at some time

or other in his life without going very far from 
home. This possibility is by no means realized 
for us in the case of opera because it involves 
too great a risk in the minds of managers, who 
are bent only upon making their enterprises pay. 
Perhaps it never will be realized until the State 
recognizes its obligation to foster this form of 
art by assuming the risks. But we think that 
private management is more timid than it need 
be, and that many a neglected work of high 
importance either by virtue of inherent beauty 
or of historical significance might be found 
commercially available. The craze for the new 
thing is what at present thwarts the wishes of 
the best friends of opera. Suppose, for example, 
that instead of four new works by so mediocre 
a composer as M. Massenet we had been given 
this year four very old works by Gluck a 
genius the latchet of whose shoes few moderns 
are worthy to unloose would not the same 
lavish expenditure upon them of all our rich 
resources have borne fruit of the sort which the 
box-office craves ? And if the experiment had 
been tried and carried to success, how great 
would have been the glory ' ' enough for all " 
to be shared by those whose faith had been justi- 
fied ! This is but a single example ; many others 
might be brought forward. In respect of variety 
of opportunity, we were operatically better off in 
the bad old days of the "star," and the shabby 
support, and the small orchestra, and the ragged 
chorus, and all the other " unhappy far-off 
things " that opera meant for the generation 
before our own. 



SCENERY AND THE WEATHER 
IN DICKENS. 



Scenery, for its own sake, Dickens rarely cared 
to describe. But no novelist ever attained a more 
complete mastery of the art of handling scenery and 
weather in relation to his characters or their actions. 
Throughout his stories, the natural background and 
conditions serve mainly to typify or emphasize the 
mood of the persons projected against the back- 
ground, or the action in which they are engaged. 
When Mr. Pickwick and his friends go down to 
spend a happy Christmas at Dingley Dell, the 
weather is cold, but bright and bracing and conducive 
to high spirits and famous appetites. It is winter, 
also, when the disgraced Lady Dedlock in " Bleak 
House" wanders to her death; but then the scene 
is laid in the freezing mud and slush of London, at 
the dawn of a bleak December day. 

The English fog, chiefly known perhaps (at least 
to Americans) through Dickens's accounts of it, plays 
a prominent part in many of the novels. That " Lon- 



don particular " as the little attorney in " Bleak 
House" calls it, half out of affectionate pride 
drifts through the opening pages of " A Christmas 
Carol," sharpening Old Scrooge's temper and serv- 
ing to intensify the bitter cold, while at the same 
time emphasizing the snug indoor comforts of 
Christmas Eve. At the beginning of " Bleak House " 
we enter an exceedingly thick fog, which, as claiming 
acquaintance with a kindred spirit, eddies round and 
pervades the Court of Chancery. Indeed, fog and 
mist and rain seem to hover perpetually over the 
landscape in this novel. When not visible in Lon- 
don, they are sure to be at Lady Dedlock's place 
down in Lincolnshire. The Kentish country, with 
its foggy marshes, is the scene of Pip's early adven- 
tures in "Great Expectations." When the child 
meets the convict in the old churchyard, the rime 
lies like spiders' webs on the hedges and the grass, 
and a thick mist comes rolling up from the river. 
The cattle grazing on the marshes, the gates and 
dikes, all come rushing through the fog at the 
conscience-smitten little Pip, with the stolen pork 
pie in his pocket. 

One of the most memorable instances of Dickens's 
power of using natural phenomena to symbolize and 
vivify his human plots occurs in the early pages of 
" A Tale of Two Cities." It is that scene, in Dr. 
Manette's house in Soho, where the Doctor and his 
daughter, with Sidney Carton and Darnay, sit by 
an open window in the dusk, while a thunderstorm 
slowly gathers outside. The house stands in a cor- 
ner of the square, "a quaint corner, wonderful 
for echoes, a peculiar ear of a place. There are not 
only echoes of approaching steps, which seem to 
stop ; but also echoes of other steps that never come, 
dying away for good when they seem close at hand." 
The sense of impending storm hangs oppressively 
upon the little group. " They spoke low, as people 
watching and waiting mostly do; as people in a 
dark room, watching and waiting for Lightning, 
always do. There was a great hurry in the streets, 
of people speeding away to get shelter before the 
storm broke; the wonderful corner for echoes re- 
sounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and 
going, yet not a footstep was there." With the ris- 
ing wind the echoes come fast and faster, and Lucie 
speaks of her fanciful interpretation of them as " the 
echoes of all the footsteps that are coming by-and-by 
into our lives." 

" ' I take them into mine ! ' said Carton. ' I ask no ques- 
tions and make no stipulations. There is a great crowd bear- 
ing down upon us, Miss Manette, and I see them by the 
Lightning.' He added the last words, after there had been 
a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window. 
' And I hear them ! ' he added again, after a peal of thunder. 
' Here they come, fast, fierce, and furious ! ' It was the rush 
and roar of rain that he typified, and it stopped him, for no 
voice could be heard in it. A memorable storm of thunder 
and lightning broke with that sweep of water, and there was 
not a moment's interval in crash and fire and rain, until after 
the moon rose at midnight.'' 

'"Good-night, Mr. Carton,' said the man of business. 'Good- 
night, Mr. Darnay. Shall we ever see such a night again,

together?' Perhaps. Perhaps, Me the great crowd of people 
with its rush and roar, bearing down upon them, too." 

Here, in prophetic Rymbolization, are indicated all 
the later events of the novel, the storm of tin- 
Revolution, involving and imperilling every member 
of the little group, the loud surging mobs of Saint 
Antoine, Carton's noble self-sacrifice. 

In the journeys by stage coach described in tin- 
various novels, there is generally either entire har- 
mony between the traveller's sentiments and the 
feelings engendered by his surroundings, or else we 
find a sharply drawn contrast. When Nicholas 
Nickleby goes down with Squeers and some uncom- 
fortable small boys to Dotheboy's Hall, it is bitter 
weather, hard enough to bear even were the trav- 
ellers in a cheerful frame of mind. But Nicholas's 
heart is already depressed on account of his long 
distance from home and the more than dubious 
prospect before him ; and so the journey is for him 
a dismal one indeed. But later, when he has won 
a fortune and a wife, he travels down into York- 
shire again. The coach and inns and landscape are 
all just as they were before ; but how differently are 
they made to appear to him ! 

A characteristic scene is that where Ralph Nick- 
leby, with all his schemes brought to naught, and he 
himself on the way to take his own life, observes a 
certain black cloud in the overshadowed sky. It 
seems to follow him, "coming slowly and mourn- 
fully up, like a shadowy funeral train." From the 
garret of his dreary house, he looks out of the win- 
dow foi the hist time, and sees this same sullen, 
gloomy mass, whose baleful meaning he has now 
come to know. 

" Martin Chuzzlewit " and " Our Mutual Friend " 
are the novels which doubtless display Dickens at 
his best in this correlation of scenery and weather 
with the thoughts and actions of his characters. Mr. 
Pecksniff and Jonas Chuzzlewit make an excursion 
into the country on a lovely spring evening. As 
they walk along past the silent fields, the odor of 
newly-turned earth, with a thousand other pleasant 
scents, is in the air and the smoke is rising slowly 
from the cottage chimneys. " It was a time when 
most men cherish good resolves, and sorrow for 
the wasted past ; when most men, looking on the 
shadows as they gather, think of that evening which 
must close on all, and that to-morrow which has none 
beyond." But the cringing knave, Jonas Chuzzle- 
wit, who views this scene, has no such thoughts. His 
characteristic comment is, Precious dull ! Enough 
to make a man go melancholy mad." And when 
this same villain journeys down to Salisbury, plot- 
ing to murder his associate, the furious storm which 
overtakes him forms a fit accompaniment to his own 
black thoughts. 

" Our Mutual Friend " presents a series of sombre 
pictures, in each of which the central figure is the 
passion-wasted schoolmaster, Bradley Headstone. 
He meets Lizzie Hexam in a churchyard, on a grey, 
dusty, withered, autumnal evening in London, and 
declares his passion for her. The dreariness of the 



scene is in perfect tune with his mood, which is one 
alouHy and despair. We find him again at 
I'la-hwat.-r \\.-ii Mill Lock, the appropriate lair of 
Rogue Riderhood up tin- river. This place is shown 
in the rain; at twilight on a du-ai y winter's day; in 
the comfortless dawn. Hi-ad.stom-, drawing steadily 
toward the commission of hi- crime, stands one after- 
noon at the brink of the lock in the driving rain. 
The hlack clouds, rolling heavily toward one quar- 
ter of the heavens, hang like a dark curtain ht-hind 
him ; and his face, as Rider hood remarks, is like 
a ghost's. After Headstone has attacked his rival 
and left him for dead, he returns to tin- lock-limiM-. 
reaching it before dawn. "Stars were yet vi^ii.h-. 
but there was a dull light in the east that was not 
the light of night. Seen through the mist along tin- 
river, the trees were the ghosts of trees and tin- 
water was the ghost of water. The earth and the 
pale stars looked spectral ; while the cold eastern 
glare, expressionless, with the eye of the firmament 
quenched, might have been likened to the stare 
of the dead." Every phrase of this description of 
the night is made to impress upon the reader the 
thoughts and feelings which the scene gives rise to 
in the murderer's breast. 

In numberless other instances, nature is thus 
made an accessory to human passion. But however 
sombre or joyous the scene may be, Dickens shows 
us that its vital interest for him was as a background 
for the characters which his genius created to charm 

and instruct the world. v

AUTHORS AND PUBLISHERS. 

(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 
It is the pleasing habit of a certain literary club 
in London to invite, once a week during the season, 
some distinguished man to be the guest of the even- 
ing. A theme is suggested for discussion, and the 
embarrassed stranger, after listening to hal f a coin m 1 1 
of panegyric from the chairman, subdues his blushes, 
fortifies himself hastily with one final glass of tin- 
club champagne, and rises to reply to the toast of 
the evening. He is expected, in short, to pay for 
his dinner by providing a dissertation on tin- topic 
of the day; but it not unfrequently happens that in 
his eagerness to disclaim all the admirable qualities 
attributed to him by the chairman he makes but a 
perfunctory reference to the subject so carefully 
selected by the secretary, and it is left to some later 
speaker to step into the breach. Some of these 
Monday dinners at the Authors' Club are interest- 
ing; others are profoundly dull. The general stand- 
ard of after-dinner speaking in this country is not, 
perhaps, particularly lofty ; and good writers are 
frequently men to whom oratory is difficult. But 
when an author can speak, he can generally speak 
very well indeed: there is a literary lini.-h al>..ut his 
style, a cadence in his sentences, a careful choice of 
words. Two of the best after-dinner speakers I

know are also well-known novelists, Mr. Anthony 
Hope Hawkins and Mr. Horace Annesley Vachell. 

The literary fraternity is always ready to discuss 
the subject of publishing, and it was a happy thought 
that made Mr. Reginald Smith, editor of the " Corn- 
hill Magazine " and head of the historic publishing 
house of Smith, Elder & Co., the honored guest of 
a recent Monday dinner at the Authors' Club. The 
topic for discussion was thus phrased : " Does the 
Author Understand the Publisher, and Vice Versa? " 
It is a question that has agitated the world of letters 
ever since the days of Samuel Johnson, when the 
bookseller began to replace the private patron as the 
real Maecenas of literature. 

The booksellers, in fact, were the original pub- 
( lishers: even at the present day there are a few 
houses in London which combine the two trades. 
But it is an age of specialization, and there are not 
many men who have the time or the talent to com- 
bine both callings. Mr. Arthur L. Humphreys, of 
Hatchartls' in Piccadilly, is one of the last sur- 
vivors of the double trade ; Mr. Elkin Mathews, hard 
by in Vigo Street, is another ; the late Mr. Elliot 
Stock was a third. I can not recall any others of 
importance. The conjunction of author and publisher 
is yet more rare, although several big publishing 
houses have been founded by men who had previously 
tried their hands at writing. Mr. Methuen began 
by publishing his own schoolbooks; he continues 
to write occasionally at the present time. The late 
Mr. Robert Buchanan supplies the sole instance in 
my recollection of a prominent author setting up an 
office for the express purpose of publishing his own 
works : some two or three years before his death his 
name adorned for a short time the window of a shop 
in Shaftesbury Avenue. But the experiment failed. 
It is a sad fact that few authors of imagination have 
any talent for the sober routine of business, they 
are commonly gamblers by nature : they cannot bring 
themselves to woo success by the prosaic method of 
cutting down expenses. It is the details that count 
in the modern business of publishing. 

I do not think the author recognizes sufficiently 
how the conditions of the trade have changed of 
late years. Thirty or forty years ago it was com- 
paratively easy to make money ; to-day there is a 
steady procession of publishers wending their melan- 
choly way to the Court of Bankruptcy. Several 
causes have combined to produce this unfortunate 
result unfortunate alike to publisher and author. 
In the first place, it grows harder every year for the 
publisher to secure a good bargain. The author has 
been educated up to a sense perhaps in some in- 
stances an inflated sense of his own value. Thirty 
years ago it is possible that he erred in the other 
direction, and no doubt there was more than suffi- 
cient justification for the late Sir Walter Besant 
when, in 1883, he founded the Society of Authors. 
Many things called for alteration and improvement 
in the common methods of the publishers of that 
time ; and the Society has done, and continues to do, 
excellent work in the matter of revising agreements 



on behalf of its members and providing them with 
the best legal assistance when in difficulties. But 
in its zeal for the author's welfare it has, naturally, 
made it harder for the publisher to secure a good 
bargain. It has sedulously preached the advantages 
of the royalty system, and warned the readers of its 
monthly organ against the practice of selling their 
copyrights for a lump sum. It points out strongly 
to its members the unwisdom of signing away any 
rights in future books. 

But the sensible publisher does not complain now 
of the Society of Authors: he reserves his bitterness 
for the Literary Agent. Within the last ten years 
or so this gentleman has assumed a position of re- 
markable importance in the world of letters. He 
came into being, I believe, nearly thirty years ago, 
and his mission was to take the burden of business 
matters off the incapable shoulders of the author. 
Paid by a commission on the sums he received, his 
own interests obviously lay in the same direction as 
his clients': the more he could extract from the 
pockets of the publisher the better for both the au- 
thor and himself. And he discovered, too, sources 
of profit that would never have occurred to a mere 
writer. Serial rights, English and American, we 
already knew ; he invented, after a decent lapse of 
time, second serial rights, and even, in cases of 
extreme popularity, third. The big men flocked to 
his doors : here was a man who could do their bar- 
gaining for them, relieve them of all the worry and 
trouble of business arrangements, and double their 
income at the cost of a small percentage. An age 
of delightful freedom dawned for the happy artist ; 
at length his craft was divorced from sordid details : 
all that he had to do now was to write his stuff and 
send it in to the agent, secure in the knowledge that 
no possible source of profit would be left untapped, 
and that no silly notions of friendship, loyalty, or 
gratitude for past favors would hamper him if it 
came to a question of deserting a former publisher 
for one who offered better terms. 

It is the business of the literary agent to screw 
publishers up to the proper pitch of generosity, and 
to this end he invites them to bid against each other 
for the works of the more popular favorites of the 
day. Some novelists scarcely ever bring out two 
consecutive books with the same house : they put 
their wares up to auction openly, unashamed; and 
the highest bidder, no matter what his reputation, 
secures them if he can bring himself to offer a few 
pounds more than the last on account of royalties. 
He does not often make money over the transaction : 
it is rare indeed for the book to earn more than his 
advance, and in most cases the publisher's ledger 
shows a loss on the deal. But new firms have to 
make a start: they want one or two well-known 
names on their list to give it an air of importance, 
and they are prepared to pay for the privilege. It 
is the new firms who put money into the agent's 
pocket. 

Thus, between them, the Society of Authors and 
the literary agent have done a good deal to destroy 



118 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



the old feeling between author and publisher. I do 
not say that they have succeeded in destroying it 
entirely. There are still certain authors of emi- 
nence who, like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (chairman 
the other evening at the dinner I have mentioned 
above), maintain a pleasant intimacy with their 
publishers and have come to the conclusion that it 
is the wiser policy to let the majority of their books 
issue from the same house. But their case is the 
exception rather than the rule. The commercial 
element has taken, I think, too strong a hold of the 
author of to-day : he is apt to regard the publisher 
as a rogue from whom he and his agent art* justi- 
fied in extracting the uttermost farthing. He will 
expatiate upon the enormous profits that some firms 
have made by a single happy hit, forgetful of the 
many losses that have to be set against a rare suc- 
cess. If a publisher loses money, it is clearly his own 
fault; if he prospers, it must be through swindling his 
authors. Holding these views, the modern novelist is 
never satisfied unless he gets considerably the better 
of any bargain. It seems a short-sighted policy. 

The rise of cheap fiction has been another thorn 
in the side of the publisher. In the days of the 
three-volume novel, sold to the libraries at a price 
that left an ample margin of profit, there was little 
risk in the publication of a story even by a new 
writer, while the possibilities of gain were very large. 
In this form the selling powers of the book could 
be tested sufficiently to show whether it was worth 
while to issue a cheaper edition at six shillings, and, 
perhaps, another at two later on. But the libraries 
rebelled, and the single volume at six shillings came 
into vogue, to be threatened in its turn by seven- 
penny and sixpenny reprints, and by a determined 
effort on the part of some firms to swamp the mar- 
ket with new novels at two shillings net. For the 
last five or six years it has grown steadily mere diffi- 
cult to sell an edition of a novel at the old price. 
Cheap fiction the sixpenny and sevenpenny re- 
prints have possibly increased the sales of the 
writers who appear in that form, but they have cer- 
tainly made it far harder for the new man to obtain 
a hearing. The general public will not buy a six- 
shilling novel by an unknown author when they can 
get the best stories of Mr. H. G. Wells, " Anthony 
Hope," and a dozen other good writers, in a cheap 
and attractive form. I find that this tells chiefly 
against those numerous novelists who used to have 
a sale of two or three thousand copies and under. 
The subscription list for their books has fallen off 
by about one-third during the last few years. 

In short, these recent developments in the English 
book market have tended all in one direction in 
favor of the author of established popularity as 
against his weaker brethren and his publisher. The 
big seller makes more money than he did, and the 
small seller is being surely but gradually squeezed 
out of existence. This would be a matter of small 
consequence were the less popular writers always 
the less deserving of popularity. But the names in 
which English literature takes most pride to-day are 



not commonly those of men who reaped an early 
and facile success. I have often found myself won- 
dering whether the late George Meredith would 
have won his way to recognition if he had started 
his career in an age of cheap fiction. The three- 
volume form preserved him for posterity : it enabled 
him to get a hearing for his earlier work, to establish 
a position before the reduction in prices came into 
vogue. But this is to wander from the subject. 
The author and publisher should be allies, working 
together for their mutual advantage. Here at the 
present time they are too often enemies, and the 
change is good for neither party. " Now Barabbas 
was a publisher," the gentleman who first pro- 
pounded that witty misquotation must be held re- 
sponsible for a great deal.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



THE MONEY VALUE OK CULTURE, although be- 
neath the serious consideration of the true lover of 
learning, is of some significance in answering the 
question whether higher education really pays, or 
whether the late Mr. Crane was right in his condem- 
nation of the college course as a waste of time and 
money. Two years ago figures were published 
giving the average income of the members of Dart- 
mouth's class of 1899, ten years after graduation. 
This average, something over two thousand dollars, 
made a very creditable showing, being neither pain- 
fully small nor immoderately large. Now we are 
favored by the "Yale Alumni Weekly" with even 
more interesting and more detailed figures concern- 
ing the worldly prosperity of a large college class 
five years after graduation. The Yale class of 1 906 
(with the exception of that silent third which, as at 
Dartmouth, has sent in no report, and so is presum- 
ably less prosperous than the other two-thirds) en- 
joyed an average income of seven hundred and forty 
dollars in its first year out of college, and this rose 
rapidly to nearly nineteen hundred dollars for the 
fifth year. Government employment has proved the 
most remunerative of all the occupations reported, 
with finance and commerce next. Journalists have 
fared about the worst, with struggling lawyers only 
a little better off. Farmers, ranchmen, and foresters 
have done well, rising to an average income of nearly 
two thousand dollars at the end of the five-year 
period. We leave out of account the graduate stu- 
dents, whose scholarships or other emoluments are 
inconsiderable, but who are doubtless winning large 
and priceless rewards of a less material sort. On 
the whole, it is well demonstrated, if demonstration 
were necessary, that a college education does pay.

main anonymous. On the first of November Mr. 
Kennerley will issue "The Lyric Year," a volume to 
contain one hundred poems by as many American 
writers, three of whom will receive collectively the 
tidy sum of one thousand dollars five hundred as 
first prize for the very best of the one hundred 
poems, and two hundred and fifty to each of the two 
second-prize winners. Mr. Edward J. Wheeler and 
Mr. William Stanley Braithwaite will be the judges, 
and all contributions should be sent before June 1 
to the editor of "The Lyric Year," in care of Mr. 
Kennerley. It is further required that contributions 
do not exceed two hundred and fifty lines in length, 
and that a stamped and addressed envelope be sent 
with each contribution. Any number of manuscripts 
may be submitted by one person, subject to the above 
conditions. Also, poems that have been accepted 
for publication by magazines, and poems printed in 
magazines not earlier than January, 1912, may be 
submitted, but poems already printed in book form, 
or to be so printed before January, 1913, may not 
be offered. Whether anything resembling a sponta- 
neous gush of song, wherein alone the richest melody 
resides, can be prompted by this flourishing of bank- 
notes in the poet's face, remains to be seen. Immortal 
literature has never been produced under the spur of 
a prize competition. But at the same time we can 
only be grateful for any effort that is likely to turn 
intelligent interest, however temporarily, to the ser- 
vice of the muses. ... 

THE FAVORITE BOOKS OF COLLEGE STUDENTS, not 

professed students of literature, but rather the young 
men who regard their college course as primarily a 
vocational training, are indicated to some extent by 
an inquiry conducted by the English department of 
Tufts College. The freshman class of the Engineer- 
ing School was asked to contribute toward a fund 
with which to purchase books for its own reading, 
and each member was requested to name one book 
for the collection. The sixty-five men of the class 
named forty-five books, the titles written on more 
than one ballot being five only, "The Light That 
Failed," " Lorna Doone," " Soldiers of Fortune," 
" David Copperfield," and "The Day's Work." The 
selections were made with such evident independence 
of the English Department's own posted lists of rec- 
ommended reading as to show that the choice was 
in general spontaneous. Next a ballot was prepared 
of the forty-five nominated books, and each student 
was asked to designate fifteen on the list as especially 
desirable, and to hand in his ballot unsigned. Fifty- 
eight members of the class complied, and the result 
showed a leading preference for " The Virginian," 
which won fifty votes, and a faint demand for "The 
Guest of John Chapman" and "The Trimmed 
Lamp," which each received one vote. Two of 
Dickens's novels ("David Copperfield" and "Pick- 
wick"), one of Scott's ("Ivanhoe"), and one of 
Thackeray's ("Vanity Fair"), were voted for, with 
" Copperfield " well in the lead. On the whole, the 
result of the inquiry was about what a scrutiny of 



an average public library's fiction circulation might 
have led one to predict, with a large elimination of 
stories favored by women and girls. 

... 

MR. HARDY'S HATRED OF "SHAM OPTIMISM," his 
preference for what he seems to regard as a safe 
and sane pessimism, is illustrated in the report of an 
interview published recently in the Boston "Tran- 
script." The great novelist, one of the most famous, 
one of the wealthiest, and one of the least familiarly 
known writers in England, is depicted as " a little, 
timid-looking man, very pale, and with an embar- 
rassing look that might have been irritation on his 
seared face." Asked why he was so pessimistic a 
writer, why he wrote at once the most beautiful and 
the most dreadful of stories, he replied to his 
questioner : " You are a young man. The cruelty 
of fate becomes apparent to people as they grow 
older. At first one may escape contact with it, but 
if one lives long enough one realizes that happiness 
is very ephemeral." " But is not optimism a useful 
and sane philosophy? " was next asked him. " There 
is too much sham optimism," he replied, " humbug- 
ging and even cruel optimism. Sham optimism is 
really a more heartless doctrine to preach than even 
an exaggerated pessimism the latter leaves one 
at least on the safe side. There is too much senti- 
ment in most fiction. It is necessary for somebody 
to write a little mercilessly, although of course it is 
painful to have to do it." " Love is tragic," was 
Mr. Hardy's further assertion, " but it is very beau- 
tiful." The interviewer, who signs himself " Henry 
Deal," sums up the distinguished author's outlook 
on life in four words, "the pity of it." 



THE NEWARK LIBRARY'S BELIEF IN PUBLICITY 
is strikingly attested by its issue of a handsome 
monthly publication, " The Newarker : The House 
Organ of the Newark Free Public Library, J. C. Dana, 
Librarian." Of course, as Mr. Dana's name will indi- 
cate, it is Newark in New Jersey, the most conspicuous 
Newark in the world, that is meant, and not Newark 
in Missouri or Delaware or Illinois or anywhere 
else. The January number of "The Newarker" 
being number three of the first volume contains 
a convincing statement of the reasons of the paper's 
existence. The library's stores of recreative and 
helpful material, especially the helpful part, are not 
duly appreciated, are in fact too little known about, 
by the people of Newark. Business men, in par- 
ticular, fail to recognize what an ever-present help 
in time of trouble they have in the local public 
library. " In a word," says the writer (whom we 
suspect to be the editor himself), " the library 
found that having made itself modern it needed to 
advertise the fact ! After much deliberation it was 
decided to publish, for a time at least, a journal 
which should, from month to month, try to call the 
attention of the workers and doers of the city to 
the practical every-day value of the material its 
library had gathered. Hence, The Newarker." It 
is a sixteen-page journal with an attractive array

TUK AMERICAN IMMORTALS, chosen by the Na- 
tional Institute of Arts and Letters to constitute our 
American Academy, somewhat after the model of 
the famous French Academy, include as charter 
members for a charter is to be asked for from Con- 
gress many men of prominence in literature and 
education and the arts whom all will be glad to see 
thus honored. Alphabetically the list is headed by 
the veteran Charles Francis Adams and brought to 
completion by the considerably younger though 
hardly less deserving George E. Woodberry. Mid- 
way in the list one notes, nut without a slight start 
of surprise, the self-expatriated Henry James, more 
English in some respects than the English them- 
selves. With satisfaction one reads the names of 
John Burroughs and John Muir in their respective 
alphabetical places, also those of the editors of 
" Harper's " and the " Century." Other names that 
fit well into the list are those of Howells, Rhodes, 
Brownell, Van Dyke, White (Andrew I). ), French, 
Sargent, Vedder, and Millet ; and with Professors 
Lounsbury and Matthews in the illustrious company 
to look after the language and spelling of their 
associates, there is hope of a successful future for 
the immortal band. Its present number, forty-seven, 
will, it is confidently promised, be reduced in the 
course of nature to the traditional forty. Until 
eight shall have been thus eliminated no aspirant to 

immortality need apply. 



THE ATTEMPT TO DEFINE HUMOR, prompted, or 
rather revived, by M. Bergson's recent much-talked- 
of inquiry into the causes of laughter, is respon- 
sible for the array of definitions from noted pens 
in a late number of " La Revue." Invited to take 
part in this definition bee, a considerable num- 
ber of literary men, including eight well-known 
English writers, have exercised their ingenuity in 
trying to define the indefinable. Indeed, one of the 
correspondents, no less a person than Mr. George 
Bernard Shaw, frankly admits this indefinability. 
" Humor cannot be defined," he asserts. " It is a 
primary substance which makes us laugh. You 
might as well try to prove a dogma." Mr. Zangwill 
pithily and picturesquely writes: "Humor is the 
smile in the look of wisdom "; and " F. Anstey," 
with equal brevity, declares humor to be "a delicious 
conception of the incongruous," but acknowledges 
the incompleteness of his definition. Mr. Jerome 
K. Jerome, master of humor though he is, begs the 
question by defining humor as " that which strikes 
us by its drollery." What then is drollery ? That 
which tickles our sense of humor, he might reply. 
Some of these expert utterances recall the old defi- 
nition of mind and matter: What is mind? No 
matter. What is matter? Never mind. Clearly, 



there is something ultimate and elemental in humor 
which has long been evident to the connnonsense 
of non-writing people. 



MORI ENGLISH STUDY FOB ENGINEERS is becom- 
ing the increasingly urgent recommendation of those 
who regretfully note the insufficient command of his 
own language, and the glaringly defective knowledge 
of the literature written in that language, on the 
part of the technical-school student. Professor 
Samuel Earle, head of the English department of 
Tufts Engineering School, recently commissioned 
to make a thorough investigation of the subject of 
English instruction in technical schools, finds a gen- 
erally acknowledged insufficiency of such instruction, 
and a rather encouraging disposition to supply the 
defect In fact, already a change for the better has 
been to some extent effected in certain quarters. 
But the fault is not altogether on the part of the 
technical school ; the preparatory course has been 
defective. The curriculum leading up to the higher 
institution has lacked backbone, or has consisted of 
an invertebrate conglomeration of pseudo-science, 
laboratory practice, and shopwork, much of which 
has had to be afterward unlearned. It is suggested 
by Professor Earle that, just as the ancient classics 
formed the backbone of the old-time preparation 
for college, so English might be and ought to be 
made a stiffening element in the backbone of the 
technical student's preparatory course. Schools of 
engineering are asked to unite in this important 
matter and require of the preparatory schools a 
more adequate training in English studies. 



ACTIVE AND PASSIVE READING differ from each 
other as much as do, for example, a brisk walk in 
the open in the present frigid temperature and a 
treatment from a masseur in a well-warmed room. 
This platitude is apropos of Mayor Gaynor's recent 
advice to the members of the graduating class of 
Public School 160, New York City, that they should 
form the habit of reading, first because it provides 
an antidote for boredom, and secondly because the 
reader of serious books will come out ahead of his 
unread competitor in the race of life. The reader 
for mere diversion is obviously the passive reader; 
the student of books demanding some exercise of the 
intellect, the active reader. We hear a great deal 
about the creative imagination and creative litera- 
ture, but not yet enough about creative reading 
the reading that is not simply thinking with other 
men's brains, but a process of finding oneself and 
one's proper bearings in the universe. Who shall 
say but it may be a higher art to become a creative 

reader than to be a creative writer ?

and "Lives of the Signers of the Declaration of 
Independence," without perceiving that a good deal 
of diligent research involving much correspondence 
and considerable delving in old documents has gone 
to the making of those highly readable and agreeably 
anecdotal volumes. The surviving members of the 
historian's family have recently decided to part with 
the bulk of his library, which has been stored at the 
Lossing summer home at Dover Plains, N. Y. The 
correspondence, thought to number about thirty thou- 
sand pieces, includes letters from a large number of 
historic characters, most of the prominent officers 
of the Revolution being represented as well as the 
signers (or a great many of them) of the Declaration 
of Independence. Especially numerous are auto- 
graph papers of General Philip Schuyler, acquired 
for the purpose of writing his " Life and Times." 
Early pamphlets and books of rarity and value are of 
course conspicuous in such a collection as Lossing's. 

THE INTELLIGENT LIBRARY ASSISTANT has it in 

his or her power to be of greater and more frequent 
immediate service to the visiting public than has, 
ordinarily, the less directly accessible head librarian. 
Many a library-user goes always for help to some 
one subordinate official whose kindness or whose 
timely bit of special knowledge on a certain occa- 
sion in the past has left a lasting impression on the 
grateful beneficiary. Consequently no pains taken 
to increase the assistant's breadth of intelligence 
and readiness of resource will be pains thrown 
away. Feeling, as it appears, the truth of this, 
the head of the Public Library of the District of 
Columbia has caused one hour each week to be 
allowed each assistant for reading reviews of current 
books ; and also the assistants are asked to spend 
some time in the doubtless congenial task of novel- 
reading for the purpose of obtaining additional 
subject-headings for catalogue purposes. Happy the 
worker whose calling becomes also his pastime. 



COMMUNICA TION. 



THE COMMON GENDER PRONOUN. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Referring to the paragraph in your issue of February 
1, in regard to an " hermaphrodite pronoun," will you 
allow me to say that some years ago I made a sugges- 
tion which has always seemed to me worthy of more 
attention than it has received. My suggestion was: 

Nominative: Hi. 

Possessive: Hes. 

Objective: Hem. 

Thus by a slight redistribution of the vowels the original 
forms are closely approximated, but there is ample dif- 
ferentiation from the masculine and feminine pronouns. 

As compared with the ridiculous Than and the un- 
speakable Hiser, do you not think my suggestion an 
improvement? Certainly the need of a pronoun of 
common gender is a pressing one.

A ROUGH APPRENTICESHIP.* 



Rarely has there been put between the covers 
of a book so much of the stern but zestful reality 
of life, so much of strenuous struggle against 
adversity, so much, in short, of varied and often 
thrilling personal experience, as is recorded by 
Mr. J. E. Patterson in his " intimate autobiog- 
raphy" which he has entitled "My Vagabond- 
age." It is a book to read with a perceptible 
quickening of the pulse, a chronicle of sturdy 
striving and high-hearted courage that cannot 
fail to increase one's satisfaction in our common 
humanity. In the fell clutch of circumstance 
the writer has not winced nor cried aloud ; be- 
neath the bludgeonings of chance his head is in 
a very literal sense bloody but unbowed. Yet 
it cannot be said that there is in the book any 
vain parade of fortitude, or that the writing of 
it is a bare-faced bid for popular favor. The 
author has, after years of aspiration and by a 
rough and circuitous route, reached the longed- 
for land of literature and known the joy of seeing 
the creations of his imagination in print (after re- 
peated rejections), and the present more frankly 
personal product of his pen is a legitimate and 
welcome addition to his published works. 

After a brief preface, which successfully 
strikes the keynote of the book, the author 
divides his narrative into two parts, headed 
respectively " The Life Rebellious " and " The 
Life Adventurous," with about a dozen brisk 
and graphic chapters in each. Born in Yorkshire 
of poor parents, he was bereft of his mother in 
early childhood and lost track of his father be- 
fore he was well into his 'teens, the first thirteen 
years of his life being a tempestuous series of boy- 
ish rebellions and truancies, of runnings away 
from home and of brief and stormy experiences 
as unbidden guest at the homes of various kins- 
folk in the West Riding. Unfitted by natural 
endowment to lead the life of normal, respectable 
British boyhood, which seemed to him unbear- 
ably tame and slow, the lad took his destiny into 
his own hands and ran away to sea at thirteen, 
passed himself off as a youth of seventeen, and 
made voyages to all parts of the world, except to 
America, before the down of adolescence had stif- 
fened into the beard of manhood. And through 
it all a devouring passion for books kept pace 
with a consuming hunger for life and adventure.

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



Without being able, from lack of space, to give 
either by description or illustrative quotation an 
adequate idea of the book's remarkable variety 
and vigor, the reviewer can only say, in brief, 
that the first part is something like a very intensi- 
fied " Story of a Bad Boy," and the last like one 
of Captain Marryat's or Clark Russell's most 
thrilling sea stories. In fact, Mr. Patterson has 
already won for himself the distinction of being 
regarded by many as the successor to those two 
famous romancers of the sea. 

An extract from an early chapter will convey 
a notion of the boy Patterson's outlook on life. 
Alternately regarded by his teachers as a hope- 
lessly unruly pupil and as a marvel of precocity, 
he never learned to endure the irksomeness of 
pedagogic restraint. 

" What on earth did / want with any more schooling ? 
Could n't I read any other boy off his feet and gabble the 
newspapers over to my short-sighted elders ! Could n't 
I, did n't I, read everything that came within reach ! 
And what more could any boy be supposed to do? 
Had n't I heard time and time again that reading and 
experience were the great turnpike-roads to knowledge ? 
And was n't I travelling that way? with the one always 
in my pocket and the other harvested by a perversity 
to be ever on the move. For how could one gain experi- 
ence except by moving and doing things ? As for sums 
and that silly thing they call geography! what did it 
matter that I could n't do a sum in simple multiplication 
or division to save my head ? The world was n't made 
of sums, like it was of books. Other folks got on in life 
without sums; and I shouldn't want sums to help me 
to make books; and if I did n't do that I would go to 
sea, and there were no sums on ships; or I would be a 
farmer and what had a farmer to do with sums? 
. . . No, schools were for girls, for boys who wished to 
go to business, and for those who couldn't read or 
would n't take to it properly. I was made for books 
and the open spaces in life." 

Hatred of restraint and love of adventure 
combined to lead the boy and afterward the 
young man into many places of danger, and he 
had countless hairbreadth escapes from sudden 
death. Pure recklessness induced him to at- 
tempt the smuggling of revolutionary literature 
into Russia, in the course of his sea-roving, and 
it waa little short of a miracle that he eluded the 
police and came away unharmed, even though 
without much success in his foolhardy under- 
taking. At another time a too curious interest 
in the form of worship observed in a Buddhist 
temple at Bombay resulted in a night's impris- 
onment and a narrow escape from something 
much worse. And still another mad escapade, 
in which a company of Howling Dervishes 
howling this time with rage nearly put an 
end to his pursuit of knowledge, is to be cred- 
ited to him at about the same time. Through 
all these varied experiences the lover of open 



spaces seems never to have forgotten his final 
purpose of becoming a writer ; journals of his 
successive adventures were can-fully kept, and 
reams of verse were scribbled as the spirit 
moved. The journal-writing led a few years 
later, when a severe attack of rheumatism com- 
pelled the sailor to turn landsman, to a connec- 
tion with journals of another kind and to many 
efforts, at last successful, to get into the maga- 
zines ; and the versifying prepared the way for 
a volume of poems, "The Mermaid and Other 
Pieces," published by subscription through the 
kind offices of the public librarian at Cardiff. 
In this connection it may not come amiss to give 
a specimen of Mr. Patterson's musical verse 
from the selections with which his present work 
is furnished. Here is a song that came to him 
in a dream : 

" The sweetest song these lips e'er sang 
Was sung to mine own self in sleep; 
So through this heart's dead vaults it rang, 
That Memory bowed her head to weep. 

"I know not whence or how it came; 

It went and left but this refrain: 
' A noble life *s the greatest fame, 

And no renown is free from pain.' 

a Awake I found these eyes in tears, 

My song ascending to the skies, 
Its lines the blood and toil of years, 
Their dust-strewn hopes, their crushing fears, 
Which come hard souls to humanize 
And lift the gaze of earthward eyes." 

Mr. Patterson is already known, and becom- 
ing every day better known, as the author of 
" Fishers of the Sea," " Tillers of the Soil," 
and the just-published "Love Like the Sea," 
narratives of the realistic and moving sort which 
his long apprenticeship to struggle and hard- 
ship has fitted him to write with decided effect. 
Concerning the first of these romances of hum- 
ble life, and the end of its four years' quest of 
a publisher, the following is of interest, espe- 
cially to the tardily successful in literature : 

" We would try again. There was Mr. John Murray 
at one end of the scale, said I, the extreme west of the 
matter; and there was So-and-so's, down in Norfolk, who 
might be tempted because of the fishing nature of the 
thing. Here goes, heads for the west and tails for the 
east, twice out of three, and up went the ' lucky ' shil- 
ling that I had found just without the garden gate on 
the day we went to live there. This was the order: 
Head, tail, head. Then the MS. was packed off. I n 
ten days came ;in acccptaiu <. and I crifd: 'All glory 
be to God this day and all the days hereafter!' Within 
a month the thing was bowing humbly to critics who 
hailed it, from Aberdeen to the south coast, as a piece 
of literature. The book was freely and favorably com- 
pared to the work of dead and living, Knglish and 
foreign masters! And twenty-five times refused! We 
could hardly believe what we read. Ye gods of igno-

ranee and commercialism, that ape your belittling way 
in a nation's mentality! how many of you were doing 
beggars' duty as publishers' readers when that manu- 
script was on its four years' journey ? when no pub- 
lisher's Calypso would sing that siren-song : ' Stay, O 
Wanderer, stay with us!' Poor, insignificant, heart- 
crushed, still-hopeful, gall-saturated, twice-crippled I 
to be lifted to the feet of my long-worshipped GODS 
on the high and sacred mount of literature what a 
heart-in-the-mouth feeling it gave! What humility, 
what chastened thought, what wondering of other neg- 
lected ones on the wayside it brought in its train!" 

Thus we leave the happily " arrived " author, 
his wander-years at an end, himself blissfully 
wedded to his art, and no less blissfully united 
to a faithful and helpful wife, and with many 
years, it is to be hoped, of fruitful activity and 
well-earned happiness before him. No book, 
however, that he may produce in those coming 
years will equal in its way the story he has told 
of his life, a narrative that combines the direct- 
ness and realism of George Meek with the ro- 
mance and thrilling adventure of Robinson 
Crusoe. In closing, a critic might be tempted to 
call the author's attention to the profit he might 
have made out of that early schooling which he 
so scornfully spurned. A little more scholar- 
ship might not have hurt his pages. With that 
little more he probably would not have written 
"quothed" (p. 73) or "laid" for "lay" (p. 172), 
or committed sundry other solecisms that could 
be pointed out. Still it is subject for congratu- 
lation that, as he did not let himself be spoiled 
by vagabondage, so he has resisted from the first 
the benumbing influence of formal education. 
Few indeed are the authors who could lay bare 
their lives as fearlessly and unreservedly as Mr. 
Patterson has dared to lay bare his in " My 
Vagabondage." PERCY F. BICKNELL. 



THE THEATRE OF THE FUTURE.* 

The very great interest of the present genera- 
tion in the Theatre has manifested itself hi many 
ways. Whether these ways are different from 
those of a generation or two generations ago, 
whether there are more of them, whether they 
are more artistic or more commercial, and other 
such matters, I must leave to the historian of 
American culture when there shall ever be one. 
It will be enough here to note a few of the more 
obvious manifestations. Besides the ordinary 
productions of the theatre, then, everyone will 
think of such facts and eccentricities as the Celtic 
drama, the New Theatre, the acting in the col-

leges of old plays, the development of out-door 
acting, certain especial performances like the 
Peterborough Pageant, the MacDowell Fel- 
lowship in dramatic art, the increase of college 
courses on the drama, the immense realism of the 
stage (from ladies dancing with real bare feet to 
having real cut glass for the banquets of the 
stage), the fact that Bernard Shaw's plays are 
still presented sometimes, the interest in the 
staging of Shakespeare's plays and the study of 
how he used to stage them himself, the produc- 
tion of stage beauties in the more ordinary 
magazines, the immense popularity of motion- 
picture shows, the existence of pantomime plays 
where there are no words, and of printed plays 
where there are only words. 

These facts (and many others which would 
easily be collected by anyone whose view of the 
world was broader than the booklined walls of a 
college study) are most easily explained on the 
assumption of a very great interest in the Thea- 
tre. As I consider that interest myself it does 
not seem very intelligent. We need not mourn 
over the commercial character of the " offerings " 
at our theatres, for that is a matter that disturbs 
more intelligent civilizations than ours. But if 
one compare our commonplace and brilliant out- 
put of current dramatic criticism in papers and 
books with the astonishing flood of utterance on 
the contemporary drama which overflows Paris 
every week, meandering into every salon and in- 
undating every cq/e, one will see that ours, even 
if considerable in quality, is not so intelligent. 
It perceives and observes many facts, but it does 
not so often relate those observations and appre- 
ciations to any more or less general system of 
ideas, or, if it does, that system of ideas is likely 
to be a purely conventional one. Yet though 
not very intelligent, our interest is instinctive, 
and that perhaps furnishes as good a ground for 
the growth of a new idea as the other would, 
provided some one has the idea. 

Such views as these are not a mere stock intro- 
duction for a review ; they appear a necessary 
beginning to an inquiry as to what there is of 
interest in Mr. Gordon Craig's view of the Art 
of the Theatre. 

The first thing that struck me as I read the 
extraordinary book which conveys this view, was 
that it had nothing to do with any other mani- 
festations of interest in the drama that I had ever 
heard of. I had supposed in a general way that 
Mr. Craig's work had had some relation to the cur- 
rent efforts towards presenting plays ; but how- 
ever it may be with his work in the past, this is 
not the case with the theory of the present book.

He is on a line of his own which is in a different 
direction from the lines of stage presentation 
to-day; the further other people go on their own 
lines, and the further he goes on his line, the 
further are they apart. Mr. Craig's " Art of the 
Theatre" does not supplement present the. 
with a fuller realistic, historic, technical, histori- 
cal, or antiquarian feeling ; it does not bring the 
painter, the composer, the architect, the dancer, 
the landscape-gardener into the theatre and use 
their work more effectively to present the work 
of the dramatist. Mr. Craig does not even think 
of some synthesis of the arts such as Wagner 
had in mind, in which the different arts did not 
supplement the art of the dramatist, but com- 
bined to make one composite impression. Mr. 
Craig's idea is different from all those things : 
it is different in essence from the ideas that re- 
sult in the plays we are accustomed to see. It 
does not use the arts of painting, of music, of 
anything else to help the actor present a play. 
It does not, in fact, even want any actor (in the 
common meaning of the term), nor, we might 
add, any play. 

All these negatives will perhaps give a false 
idea, and yet it is well to begin with them. 
Mr. Gordon Craig does not, of course, conceive 
a stage without pictorial scenery, without light- 
ing and effects, without costumes and dances, 
without people, without words and action. He 
wants all these things, and wants them to be a 
great deal better and more fitted to their pur- 
pose than they are now. But he does not want 
the picture-painter to make scenes, because 
the picture-painter, who may be very clever 
about atmosphere or landscape, knows nothing 
of conditions at the theatre. He does not want 
the composer to present music which shall have 
been made with the hope of according with a 
libretto, but without regard to the ensemble that 
is to be produced. He does not want an actor 
or singer who will present some part " create " 
they are apt to say in a manner which they 
devise and not the poet. He does not want a 
poet or dramatist to write a play and leave it 
to the well-intentioned but aimless efforts of 
managers, actors, composers, dancers, carpenters, 
costumers, lighters, and others. 

He thinks of the Theatre as a means of Art. 
And art in his mind means that a man shall 
carry out his own ideas by guidance of the 
knowledge he has of how to do what he wants 
to do. It is true that an artist need not do 
everything for himself. The mural painter will 
allow assistants to do much of his preparatory 
work, the sculptor will allow workmen to cast 



his statue and carve his pedestal, tin- .mj>o8er 
must allow many men to take part in his sym- 
phony, the arehitri-t must allow many mm to 
build the cathedral which he has designed. l'ut 
such assistants or workmen must do exactly 
what the artist tells them to do. They are not 
to do things as they think best, but as lie thinks 
best, or else it is not his work, Imt an accidental 
mixture and not a work of art at all. In the 
theatre the poet, for instance, if he originates 
the work, must have everything done as he con- 
ceives it and not as the actor or actress may 
chance to conceive it, nor as the sta^c- manager 
conceives it, any more than as the si TIM painter 
or the costumer may conceive it. If those per- 
sons take part on their own account we shall 
have a composite phenomena, very interesting 
to the sociologist, to one who likes to see men 
and women working together to achieve some 
great purpose, but to the artist not interesting 
at all, at least not as a whole, not as one work 
of art. 

Such seems Mr. Craig's general conception. 
The Theatre appears to him not merely an ele- 
ment in social life, but a means for an arti>t. 
I have thought of and begun to make my 
instrument," says he, "and through this in- 
strument I intend soon to venture in my qm->t 
for beauty." If Mr. Craig has so far acted in 
other men's plays or managed other men's 
theatres, if he has produced the works of others, 
even of Shakespeare, it has been to learn his 
art. He has no more created any work of art 
in so doing than if he had made a very beautiful 
drawing from an antique cast. " It is impos- 
sible," he writes, " for a work of art ever to be 
produced, where more than one brain is per- 
mitted to direct." 

This, in a very few words, is the idea pre- 
sented by Mr. Gordon Craig. It is not, it will 
be seen, an attempt to change or correct or 
improve the present way of giving plays or 
managing theatres. It is rather the conception 
of something new and different from what is 
now being done. The idea is presented, it iniuht 
be well to note, in a manner as individual as it 
is itself. Mr. Gordon Craig does not give us 
a definition, an analysis, a treatment in any 
systematic fashion ; he proceeds in a manner 
which is perhaps more artistic, in that it is cer- 
tainly more personal. Instead of some unified 
statement we have addresses, articles, letters, 
dialogues, some of which have Keen published 
already and others which seem to apjH-ar now 
for the first time. There are, for in>tance. Mr.

Ueber-marionette, his Dialogue on the Art of 
the Theatre, a Second Dialogue in which he gives 
an account of the Art Theatre at Constance, 
Russia, and proposes a foundation for dramatic 
experiment, and we must not forget the illustra 
tions, which, though generally they do not refer 
to the text, have a very illuminating quality. 
This kind of presentation has its difficulties, 
but it has also its advantages, one of which is 
that it gives us various views of the same 
general idea. 

An idea like this is certainly most fascinating 
to the mind that loves the arts, so fascinating 
perhaps that it is not possible to view it clearly 
and sanely. To cut off at one blow all the 
annoying difficulties and troubles that bother 
the theorist and the practical man in dramatic 
matters the necessity of producing plays that 
many people will want to see, for instance, the 
harmonizing the conflicting interests and fancies 
of different kinds of people, such as actors, poets, 
proprietors, and other such, all that leaves 
one so free to think and to imagine that it can- 
not but be a pleasure. And though there is 
done away with so much that exists, there is yet 
left so much to fill its place ; the Artist of the 
Theatre (he has as yet no name) is possessed of 
some idea to which he must give form, and that 
form he will create in the theatre by means of 
color, movement, voice, rhythm, light, gesture. 
He will have in mind all the resources of the 
theatre to-day, scenes, costumes, properties, 
lights, action, dance, music, poetry ; and any or 
all of these materials he is to use in giving his 
idea form. He will design his scenes and his 
costumes and his properties, he will imagine his 
action and his grouping and his dances, he will 
write his poetry and his music. If he cannot 
do these things he is not a complete Artist of 
the Theatre : one does not become an artist 
simply by wanting to be one, and ten years or 
so is none too long a time to spend in studying 
the means and materials of one's art. The 
artist will not have to make or do all these 
things himself, at least not in every case, and 
for every play, but he must have done such 
things ; he will not have to paint the scenes him- 
self, nor to cut out the cloth for his costumes, 
nor to model his properties and paint them, any 
more than he would have to write with his own 
pen or typewrite the words of his poetry or the 
notes of his music. But he will wish them to 
be his own work, his own way of expressing the 
elements or nuances of thought and feeling that 
may develop from his conception. He will also 
make actors, singers, dancers do exactly what 



he wants them to do. (And here Mr. Gordon 
Craig thinks with pleasure of some superior 
development of the marionette.) In such a man- 
ner will a man be able to embody his idea in 
form in a truly artistic way ; everything will be 
as he thinks it should be, nothing will be the re- 
sult of chance, or of what is worse than chance 
the caprice or feeling of somebody else. Thea- 
trical production will no longer be like those 
pictures in which one artist does the landscape 
and another the animals, or in which one does 
the head and hands and another the background 
and the costume. It may be asked, perhaps, 
why the artist should not go a step further and 
design his own theatre. There would probably 
be no objection by Mr. Gordon Craig to his do- 
ing so, and doubtless everyone would have some 
particular ideas about construction that he would 
desire to see carried out. But the Theatre in 
its general idea would seem as fundamental an 
artistic means as the picture, the book, the 
orchestra ; and my own idea (if I were applied 
to for counsel) would be that an Artist of the 
Theatre should not feel called upon to devise a 
special form of theatre to embody his idea any 
more than a novelist should have to conceive 
some new form of novel or the sculptor some 
new medium for presenting form. He might 
do so, of course, if he wished, but it is no dero- 
gation of one's artistic character to use means 
that other men have devised but which have 
become traditional through exercise. 

All this gives but a sketch of Mr. Gordon 
Craig's main idea. There are other most inter- 
esting things in his book : ideas as to realism, 
for instance, to mention theoretical matters, 
comment on various theatrical circumstances, 
for practical affairs, and also, as has been said, 
the illustrations, especially the frontispiece, 
with its remark, " I wanted to know for once 
what it felt like to be mounting up impossible 
ladders and beckoning people to come up after 
But the proposal is the main thing, 



me. 



everything else depends upon it. And though 
it will arouse astonishment, anger, despair, on 
the part of some people, it must also arouse 
exhilaration, a glow of life, a desire to create on 
the part of others. Few who love the Theatre 
will know what the book contains without want- 
ing to read it. When they do read it, different 
things will happen ; there will be all sorts of 
ideas that will conflict, oppose, combine. But 
out of such an apparent chaos it is, very often 
at least, that there arises finally something 
beautiful, harmonious, and perfect.

REMINISCENCES OF FOUR WARS.* 

Measured by General Sherman's classic defi- 
nition, there need be no hesitation in applying 
the name " war " to the Indian Campaign of 
1868-9 and to the Cuban Insurrection just JM - 
ceding the Spanish-American War, as well as 
to the Civil War in the United States and the 
Philippine Insurrection. Each of the two distin- 
guished Kansans who has recently published 
his memoirs was a participant in two wars. But 
aside from this and their state allegiance, there 
is a strong contrast between the two works. In 
his youth Governor Crawford may have had as 
strong a love of adventure as General Funston ; 
but looking back from the pinnacle of age, the 
last but one of the war governors now living, 
the former writes as a man of peace, regretting 
the violence of which he was a part, and com- 
mending the simple and rural life of his farm on 
Spring River ; while General Funston, though 
one of the kindliest and most democratic of men, 
is in the best sense a soldier of fortune, writing 
of his career in the spirit of a Drake or a Fre- 
mont. On the other hand, both of these officers 
saw much of irregular and guerilla warfare, 
Crawford on the Missouri border during the 
Civil War and in the Indian Campaign, Fun- 
ston both in Cuba and in Luzon. 

The portions of Governor Crawford's memoirs 
which deal with the battles of Wilson's Creek, 
Prairie Grove, and Jenkins' Ferry, the Price 
Raid, the Indian Campaign of 1868-9, and 
with Mr. Crawford's work as attorney for the 
Indians in defending their treaty rights, con- 
tain most of his original contribution to history. 
With many details attempting to do justice to 
minor officers, and a surprisingly fair tone 
toward the deserving Confederate leaders, the 
author devotes considerable space to a castiga- 
tion of General Fred. Steele, whose cowardice 
and incompetence led to the failure of General 
Banks's movement against Shreveport. An 
equal severity is manifested toward General 
S. R. Curtis, who was responsible for the failure 
to crush Price on his retreat from Jefferson City. 

Governor Crawford was made Colonel of the 
83d Colored Infantry in the fall of 1863, and 
some of his most interesting chapters tell of the 
bravery of this regiment. Colonel Crawford

disliked to command colored troops, but he had 
learned the habit of doing his duty. He had 
heard of the so-called " black flag " order of 
President Davis : that neither white officers nor 
the black rank and file were to receive any quar- 
ter, and that white officers of colored regiments 
had actually been hung ; but this only roused 
his fighting blood. He devoted the fall to drill- 
ing his regiment, and at Poison Springs and 
Jenkins' Ferry, and in many another action, they 
proved their discipline and their mettle. 

" The black flag order of the Confederacy was a god- 
send to the colored regiments. Every officer and every 
soldier knew that it meant the bayonet, with no quarter, 
whenever and wherever they met the enemy. At least 
that was the definite understanding among the officers 
and enlisted men of the Eighty-third U. S.; and the 
regiment was drilled and disciplined and instructed 
accordingly." 

After the battle of Poison Springs, in which the 
colored regiment lost a hundred and eighty-two 
and the federal white regiment thirty-seven, thus 
clearly demonstrating that the Confederates 
were pursuing the policy of no quarter toward 
the colored troops, the Eighty-third held a coun- 
cil of war and decided 

That in the future the regiment would take no pris- 
oners, so long as the Rebels contiuued to murder our men ; 
but that no wounded Confederate should be harmed or 
injured in any way, but left where he fell. This agree- 
ment was carried out, so far as possible in the heat of 
battle." 

Governor Crawford bears steadfast testimony 
to the valor and loyalty and good behavior of 
the colored troops. 

Governor Crawford had much to do with 
establishing the financial footing of Kansas, 
visiting New York on more than one occasion 
to persuade the money market of the stability 
of Kansas state securities. But his most excit- 
ing experiences were in connection with the 
Indian depredations of 1867 and 1868 on the 
western border. Each summer it became neces- 
sary to call out state troops, and each time the 
division of responsibility for control of the In- 
dians between the War and the Interior depart- 
ments made action slow and entailed upon the 
Kansas frontiersmen great loss of property and 
life. Finally, in November, 1868, after the ter- 
rible battle on the Arickaree, in which fifty 
volunteers under Colonel Forsythe resisted for 
a week the attack of eight hundred Cheyennes, 
losing half their number, the Governor called 
out the Nineteenth Kansas Cavalry and himself 
resigned to accept the colonelcy. After a severe 
winter campaign, when the hostile Indians had 
been driven back to the Indian Territory, Colonel

Crawford resigned the regiment to Colonel H. L. 
Moore, whose graphic account of the campaign 
is quoted, and himself proceeded to Washington 
to work for the payment of his command. No 
one has shown more frankly than Governor 
Crawford how the Indians were cheated and 
wronged under the vacillating policy of our 
government. But let those whose sympathy is 
entirely with the Indians read also Governor 
Crawford's account of the frontier raids. 

" Had the government at an early date adopted a just 
and firm Indian policy and adhered to it, the soil of 
every township of land west of the Appalachian Range 
would not have been saturated with human blood. But 
that was not done. The humanitarians, who knew 
Hothmg about the real character of the wild Indians, 
were going to manage them by moral suasion and with 
beautiful flowers, as some ladies reclaim murderers 
when on trial for their lives." 

Governor Crawford's book is a contribution 
to national as well as to local history. While 
the modern and military slang into which the 
author often falls is to be pardoned the veteran, 
yet it is regrettable. 

The sentiment just quoted from Governor 
Crawford regarding the unwisdom of the hu- 
manitarian non-combatant would constitute a 
sympathetic link with General Funston, for he 
too had some of his warfare to wage with semi- 
barbarous peoples and suffered severe criticism 
at the hands of those who did not fully under- 
stand the conditions under which he had to 
operate. 

General Funston does not profess to be writ- 
ing a history of the two wars in which he partici- 
pated, but only to give an account of what he 
saw, with enough of general conditions to enable 
the reader to understand the narrative. " For 
this is nothing more than a contribution, such 
as it may be, to the literature of adventure." 
And as such, it must be admitted that it is very 
interesting reading. General Funston has a 
style which, if not always classical, is crisp and 
clear and pointed. He, too, especially in the part 
of his reminiscences dealing with the Philip- 
pines, indulges in more or less reportorial slang. 
He follows Kipling more than he does Stev- 
enson. 

The boy Funston, after some exciting adven- 
tures alone on the Yukon River, which proved 
that he deserved his nickname of " Fearless 
Fred," enlisted with the Cuban insurrectos as 
a result of the fiery eloquence of General Sickles. 
Four chapters of his book are occupied with the 
account of his experiences in serving as artillery 
officer under Gomez and Garcia. The revelation 
of Cuban spirit and character has all the evi- 



dence of sincerity and truthfulness. Funston 
has many good words to say of the bravery, the 
devotion, the kindness, and consideration of his 
Cuban comrades. While admitting that he 
entered the Cuban service chiefly from love of 
adventure, he sympathized with their desire for 
independence, and still believes that 

" Fairminded Americans, who will consider the tremen- 
dous sacrifices made by the people of the island, will 
want to see the young republic endure. That is the 
attitude of the few of their countrymen now surviving 
who shared with the patriots the dangers, the hunger, 
and other privations of the final struggle." 

But likewise of the Spanish soldier, both in 
Cuba and in the Philippines, the author has 
good to say. 

" He was brave and patient, and by no means the 
inhuman brute that he has been made out to be, but he 
had little heart in the war, and was always getting 
yellow fever and other undesirable things." 

General Funston also has a word of generous 
appreciation of a brave negro. 

" Our first sergeant [at the siege of Victoria de las 
Tunas] was a negro as black as night. He was a brave 
and faithful fellow, and had long ago deserved promo- 
tion, but our chief had feared we Americans would re- 
sent such action. But Las Tunas settled it with us, and 
we went to the general in a body and said we would be 
glad to have him as a fellow officer. He was glad to 
comply, and it was my pleasant task to surprise the gal- 
lant soldier by handing him his commission as second 
lieutenant." 

One may wonder whether General Funston's 
democracy has so far survived ten years of regu- 
lar army life as to tolerate a colored messmate 
to-day ! 

General Funston is quite unconventional in 
commenting frankly on army officers and con- 
ditions. He does not hesitate to say that "the 
clamor of the yellow section of the press and the 
deliverances of politicians play ing to the galleries 
so inflamed public sentiment that the hand of 
the administration was forced and we were in 
for a short and sharp little war [with Spain]." 
He was ordered to Tampa to furnish informa- 
tion on Cuban conditions to General Shafter, 
but that gentleman " seemed to regard him with 
suspicion," and that " was the attitude of the 
higher officers generally." Of General E. S. 
Otis he remarks that "one would about as soon 
think of cracking a joke in his presence as of 
trying to pull his beard." 

In his Preface the author calls attention to 
the embarrassment of the inevitable resort to the 
first personal pronoun, and assures the reader 
that he is aware that he " was by no means the 
only person present in Cuba or Luzon." On 
the whole, this apology is unnecessary; for the

author is scrupulously generous in 
the merits and achievements of others, and at 
the same time is far from loath to report his 
own failures and humiliations. When Gover- 
nor Leedy sent for him to take command of the 
Twentieth Kansas Infantry, and Mr. Funston 
offered some suggestions on the need of a good 
drill-master, the Governor "told me bluntly that 
if I did not take the regiment he would give it 
to Mr. So and So. I knew that I could not be 
a worse colonel than the man named, and ac- 
cepted." At the muster-in of the regiment, 
Colonel Funston had not yet received his uni- 
form. He went out in citizen's clothes, and was 
halted by a sentry who informed him that visitors 
were not allowed within the limits of the camp. 

- I replied, somewhat icily, that I was the colonel of 
the regiment. The sentry was a very tall man, and 
altitude has never been one of my charms; so the man 
bent his head until his month was within a couple of 
inches of one of ray ears, and, as a most engaging grin 
overspread his features, whispered, 'Try the next sentry. 
He's easy!'" 

At San Francisco Colonel Funston became 
very well acquainted with General Shafter, but 
" never mustered up courage to ask him why I had 
made such a poor impression on him at Tampa. 
He was a blunt man, and might have told me." 
But decidedly the best of these jokes at the 
Colonel's own expense is in his interview with 
General Miller. 

" When I entered, saluted rather stiffly, and announced 
the object of my visit, General Miller looked up, and, 
as a kindly smile overspread his features, said, Well, 
well ; so you are a colonel, are you ? Sit right down on 
this box and tell me how anybody came to make a young 
chap like you a colonel.' " 

However, the young chap convinced his supe- 
riors that those who appointed him had made no 
mistake. Opportunities for reckless daring were 
plentiful in the Philippines, and were seldom 
neglected by Colonel Funston. His own account 
does not always make him the picturesque figure 
painted by the reporters of the Twentieth Kan- 
sas, but even Funston's modesty cannot conceal 
the fact that he was brave and resourceful and 
generous to his men. Generals Wheaton and 
MacArthur occupy a prominent place in the 
narrative, and are well characterized. It is not 
the part of this review to re- tell General Fun- 
ston's story. If tales of war must be read, 
General Funston's are as vivid as any and as 
little gruesome as may be. And if professional 
soldiers there must be, those who know him well 
will be thankful that the fearful work can be 
in the hands of as human and humane a man as 

Frederick Funston.

A NOTABLE STUDY OF POET in.- 

Most readers of poetry who ask thciiis.-lv.-s 
what poetry is are in the position of St. Augus- 
tiin', who, in another connection, said, "If not 
asked, I know; if you ask me, I know not." 
Poetry has been defined so often, in so many 
ways, and with so little success, tli.-it when a 
fresh attempt is made we are inclined to be so 
skeptical as not to examine it, on the assumption 
that here is another dreary eulogy of imagina- 
tion, of the sort that has flourished during the 
past hundred years. ProfessorNeilson's lectures 
(" Essentials of Poetry," not " Tin- Kss.-ntials uf 
Poetry," one notes with approval) is a ]>l.-a>ant 
disappointment to the skeptical reader. Unlike 
the studies by perfervid romantic- critics and 
" Germanized " scholars, it contains no pet 
eccentric theory of poetry, but seems to aim, in 
the good old Socratic sense, to discover the truth. 
With refreshing sobriety the author seeks the 
solution, not in a new term and not in a new 
interpretation of old terms, but in a new com- 
bination of old terms. 

Poetry is not to be regarded as a product 
with a single essential element, but " as a com- 
posite of a limited number of elements, whose 
proportions are variable," these elements being 
the imagination, the reason, and the sense of 
fact. If one of these be lacking in a givm 
poetical product, the other two cannot make 
good the deficiency ; if one be in excess, the 
poem must in some degree suffer ; if all three 
are present in balance, the poem has the chief 
traits of a masterpiece. In literary history the 
excess of each of the factors in turn has given 
rise to what we call Romanticism, Classicism, 
and Realism. " Romanticism is the tendency 
characterized by the predominance of imagina- 
tion over reason and the sense of fact. Classicism 
is the tendency characterized by the predomi- 
nance of reason over imagination and the sense 
of fact. Realism is the tendency characterized 
by the predominance of the sense of fact over 
imagination and reason." This disposes so easily, 
one might almost say so prettily, of three treach- 
erous terms, that one is instinctively antago- 
nistic ; but simple as the definitions are, they will 
bear close scrutiny. 

The chapters following are devoted to a dis- 
cussion of the three conspicuous traits of poetry 
and the three terms associated with the domi- 
nance of one or other of these traits. The 
chapter on imagination is, perhaps of necessity.

the least satisfactory ; for, as the author himself 
suggests, no chapter of sixteen pages could dis- 
cuss adequately so elusive a subject. The various 
definitions of romanticism are then attacked 
lustily, those stressing Medievalism and the 
"return to nature" yielding most readily; after 
which the definition given in an earlier chapter 
is insisted on. In the next chapter, reason is 
made substantially equivalent to " form," and 
the meaning of classical is clearly analyzed. 
Finally comes the sense of fact, " lending steadi- 
ness to imagination and supplying material to 
reason," which, when it dominates, tends to 
produce realistic poetry. 

These are the ingredients of the magic cal- 
dron ; the fire that should melt and fuse them 
is Intensity, a term that, as Professor Neilson 
says, has the advantage of being less dubious in 
meaning than emotion, or feeling, or passion. 
Incidentally, it is the element that Arnold 
sought when he seized on " high seriousness." 
In this chapter is included the matter of rhythm, 
" one of many aids to the expression of inten- 
sity." Intensity is, then, quite as essential as 
the three elements already discussed ; in Landor, 
for instance, who possessed the three elements in 
approximate balance, we find in his lack of in- 
tensity an explanation of his failure to produce 
poetry of the first order. 

The rest of the book is devoted to an ex- 
amination of certain minor qualities of poetry 
sentiment and sentimentalism, and humor in its 
various aspects. The distinction between senti- 
mentalism on the one hand and sentiment and 
passion on the other, together with the historic 
survey and the application of examples, forms a 
chapter of great interest and throws much light 
on the leading conceptions of the book. Of still 
more interest intrinsically, though of less im- 
portance as a part of the book, is " Humor in 
Poetry," a theme that has hitherto had no ade- 
quate treatment. 

Such, in brief, are Professor Neilson 's Lowell 
Lectures on poetry. Only one difficulty is likely 
to occur to the reader, a difficulty involved in 
the definition of romanticism as the predomi- 
nance of imagination over reason and the sense 
of fact. The author has in mind that recurring 
predominance of the imagination that enables 
us to call romantic two eras so unlike as the age 
of Elizabeth and the Romantic Movement of the 
early nineteenth century. Most critics who have 
essayed a definition of romanticism have had in 
mind primarily the Romantic Movement. From 
Goethe and Heine to Mr. Watts-Dunton and 
Professor Beers, critics have tried to lay hold 



of the essence of nineteenth century romanti- 
cism ; and in their conception of romanticism 
they have included, rightly or wrongly, what 
Professor Neilson disposes of as sentimentalism. 
When Sainte-Beuve asserted that reverie is at 
the heart of romanticism, he was thinking, not 
of Elizabethan England and Calderon and Lope 
de Vega, but of those who exemplified in one 
way or another the traits of Rousseau, high- 
priest of sentimentalism and father of latter-day 
romanticism. One cannot quarrel with the con- 
clusion that Professor Neilson reaches through 
regarding romanticism as a tendency that flares 
out at intervals in the history of poetry ; but 
one must remember that, from this point of 
view, the Romantic Movement was largely, per- 
haps mainly, sentimental, at least if one is 
thinking of the Romantic Movement on the 
Continent as well as in England. 

Professor Neilson does not endeavor to arrive 
at a final definition of poetry ; he seeks, rather, 
to limit the meaning of some of " the hard- 
worked counters of the critical game," to relate 
these terms to the nature of poetry and to each 
other and to the perfect work of art. Second- 
arily he seeks to give the reader of poetry a point 
of view from which he may see more clearly what 
poetry is, what "schools" of poetry are, and by 
means of which he may derive a keener aesthetic 
enjoyment from the reading of poetry. And 
though for the most part distinctly popular in 
treatment, these lectures will not fail to engage 
the attention of the scholar. Aside from acute 
illustrative comments on Thomson, Burns, 
Wordsworth, Byron, and Arnold, Professor 
Neilson presents a view of poetry that has un- 
usual clarifying properties. Whoever ventures 
into the misty and hungry lands of romantic 
criticism, is likely to come away (as one Elizur 
Wright came away from Carlyle's works) " with 
an unaccountable sense of emptiness." To 
Shelley, poetry is " the expression of the imag- 
ination," to Hazlitt "the language of the imag- 
ination and the passions," to Ruskin "the sug- 
gestion, by the imagination, of noble grounds 
for the noble passions," and so on till one 
is faint with "imagination" and the tenuous 
definitions of that word. In Professor Neil- 
son's discussion one finds, once more, fresh air 
and intellectual poise. As a piece of sound 
expository writing the book is notable; and 
the sturdy manner of presentation is, happily, 
a token of sturdy thought and of avoidance 
of the metaphysical profundity that is after 
all not always profound.

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



SHATTERING THE SHAW MY i n 



Mr. Bernard Shaw has written to the publish- 
ers of Dr. Archibald Henderson's voluminous 
biography of himself, to say that in view of the 
biographer's difficulties in making such a book 
he had done " extraordinarily well." Those 
who know their Shaw will understand what is 
meant ; for no living human being is harder to 
bring under the lens and see as he is, and few 
human beings have been more misrepresented, 
than the author of "Man and Superman." 

In over five hundred pages, with an energy 
and carefulness and sympathy which deserve 
high commendation, Dr. Henderson has pre- 
sented his subject from all conceivable angles ; 
has not been afraid to make himself a Boswell 
of intimate revelation to this erratic Johnson; 
and certainly has achieved the result of giving 
anyone willing to peruse so elaborate a biography 
a rounded impression of Shaw, a sense of his 
many-sidedness, and a realization of his essential 
seriousness, which shall conspire to a truthful 
picture of a much-maligned man. 

The study is of the kind to make excuse for 
the laugh or the sneer of the scoffer. It assumes 
what the scoffer and there are still plenty of 
him will deny : that Shaw is a person to be 
taken as master, in the way Dr. Henderson takes 
him ; that to give him so much space and attention 
is not ridiculous. But the biography itself will 
help to dispel this rather shallow attitude, just 
because it displays, to those who judge him 
exclusively by a play or two, Shaw the Fabian 
socialist, the effective platform speaker, the bril- 
liant critic of music and painting and literature, 
and the stimulating theorist in economics, sociol- 
ogy, and ethics. It cannot fail to be seen from 
such an acquaintance that here is an intellectual 
leader, whatever you or I may happen to think, 
or think we think, of this or that drama of his. 
And as we read on, and come to get a clearer 
understanding of how he is rated in Europe, as 
one of the few British authors to-day constantly 
read, followed, and discussed, further light upon 
his true position will have been received. 

This service Professor Henderson's book does 
perform; and I incline to call it a great one. 
To it may be added the intimate off-hand picture 
given of the man, at the expense of conventional 
dignity, but on the whole without violating de- 
corum. Dr. Henderson is not worried about this ; 
no more was Boswell. The object of both was

Critical Biography (authorized). By Archibald Henderson.

to show the man with the quiver of life to him. 
The Socratic dialogue, the newspaper interview 
style, ample quotation, a return to the theme 
for a re-definition, all serve ; for tin- mrthod is 
eclectic, and it matters not if only the result be 
attained : a sharper limning of a figure around 
which already the apochryphal clouds make mist . 
The volume has, too, the cardinal virtue of being 
intensely interesting, always readable ; this de- 
spite its length and the apparent meanderings 
of its subject-matter. Both as to the way it is 
done, and as an illustration of how the book 
smashes the Shaw myth, a single quotation will 
do more than the same amount of description. 

" Confronted with the point-blank question, 4 To what 
do you owe your marvellous gift for public speaking? ' 
Shaw characteristically replied: 'My marvellous gift 
for public speaking is only part of the G. B. S. legend. 
I am no orator, and I have neither memory enough nor 
presence of mind enough to be a really good debater, 
though I often seem to be when I am on ground that is 
familiar to me and new to my opponents. I learned to 
speak as men learn to skate or to cycle, by doggedly 
making a fool of myself until I got used to it. Then I 
practised it in the open air at the street corner, in the 
market square, in the park the best school. ... Of 
course, as an Irishman I have some fluency, and can 
manage a bit of rhetoric and a bit of humor on occasion, 
and that goes a long way in England. But marvellous 
gift " is all my eye.' " 

The study is also helpful in its detailed ac- 
count of Shaw's early days, and the light shed 
on his ancestry and immediate family. The 
result of a reading of this part of the work is 
to make clear the fact that the gifted Irishman 
came of persons of quality, whatever their idio- 
syncracies and defects; the mother, always so 
important in explaining men of genius, MfaHj 
plainly a most unusual and gifted person, and 
Shaw's bringing up, unconventional as it was, 
full of cultural influences for a coming writer, 
this being particularly true with regard to music, 
in which Mrs. Shaw was so proficient. 

Dr. Henderson's biography might easily be 
criticized on the ground of spreading its material 
over too much space ; yet given the method and 
the aim, it is a question whether it could other- 
wise be so well accomplished. Criticism might 
perhaps be directed toward the indistinct way 
Shaw is shown in relation to those time-move- 
ments of which, as the biographer says, the dra- 
matist is a part. We pass from angle to angle, 
get glimpses and suggestions that are valuable ; 
but the interlinking of it all is not quite accom- 
plished. And here again, in fairness, the diffi- 
culty of the attempt must be conceded. To offset 
this, let it be said that the chapters on the terh- 
nician and dramatist are sound and brilliant, full

of keen insight and happy turns of statement. 
An attractive feature of the work is the illustra- 
tive material, including a series of portraits of 
the subject from childhood to the present day.

KECENT FICTION.* 

" The Healer " has the general characteristics of 
Mr. Herrick's other novels a seriousness so unre- 
lieved as to he almost deadly, a lofty scorn of the 
ignoble in life and thought, an intimate knowledge 
of the currents of our feverish modern life, a strong 
feeling for natural beauty coupled with a tendency 
toward poetical or rhapsodical forms of expression, 
and a style marked by force rather than distinction. 
These qualities have their attendant defects, but the 
combination produces striking results. Had Ibsen 
been a novelist, and had he chosen Mr. Herrick's 
theme in " The Healer," he might have written much 
the same sort of a novel. We link the two names 
because the note common to both is that of a con- 
fused idealism, quite sure of what is wrong in our 
ways of life, but not very clear in its suggestions 
for setting it right. In the present instance, for 
example, the shafts of indignant satire are chiefly 
aimed at the medical profession, which we are bidden 
to behold as an occupation of sordid aims, charlatan- 
ism and trickery, and self-advertising unashamed. 
But are we seriously to believe that the way out of 
this slough (assuming it to exist) is the way of Mr. 
Herrick's skilled physician, who takes refuge in a 
northern wilderness, there ministering to such human 
flotsam as comes within his reach, or even the later 
way which brings him back to the city, to live 
in the slums and serve the poor without money 
and without price? His final phase seems the 
most rational, for it finds him directing an endowed 
hospital for the victims of nervous diseases, while 
over and above his individual striving there is some- 
what vaguely suggested the ideal of healing as an 
institutional function, taken over by society for the 
common weal. There is idealism and to spare in 
all this, but it does not seem quite certain of its aim, 
and seems still less certain of the means for attain- 
ing it. There is a strain of mysticism in Mr. Her-

rick's description of his " healer " which takes us 
dangerously near to the marshy ground of a charla- 
tanism more dangerous to social welfare than any of 
the grosser manifestations which he so unsparingly 
condemns. The fascination of straying into this 
borderland between real and fantastic thought has 
swayed many other good writers besides Mr. Her- 
rick, but it is an aberration likely to lead into an 
intellectual quagmire. The story of " The Healer " 
is concerned with the "wild man's" wooing and 
capture of a young woman whose life has been saved 
by his skill. The romantic glamour about him is 
sufficient to make her forsake home and society to 
share his wilderness life, but it does not last, and 
the lure of the flesh-pots brings about a complete 
estrangement. Not, however, before the "healer," 
in his effort to retain the love of his wife, has made 
terms with mammon, and come to feel that he has 
sold his birthright for a mess of pottage. In time, he 
wrenches himself loose from the net he has gathered 
about him, and regains something of his old inde- 
pendence and self-respect. In dealing with this situa- 
tion, the author again illustrates his favorite thesis 
that marriage pulls a man down to a lower level 
because the wife is on the side of convention and 
material comfort. This would be important, if true, 
but only a jaundiced mind can see in it the pre- 
ponderating principle of the married relation. Mr. 
Herrick's women restless, hectic, selfish, material 
creatures that most of them are seem to be studies 
in abnormal psychology rather than typical examples 
of womanhood. For every Omphale or Delilah of 
his imagining there is somewhere in the world more 
than one Alcestis or Ruth, or, to take historical ex- 
amples, more than one Beatrice or Vittoria Colonna. 
But there is one thing that may always be said for 
Mr. Herrick's novels, which is that however unpleas- 
antly they may affect the reader, they at least set 
him to thinking about the real issues of life ; they 
plunge him into its deeper currents instead of leav- 
ing him to disport himself upon its sunlit surface. 
To those who have read " Sister Carrie," Mr. 
Dreiser's new novel, "Jennie Gerhardt," will ap- 
pear one of the more significant books of the year. 
It has the same homely quality, and exhibits the 
same type of realism, as the earlier work, and is 
infused with the same sort of quiet and deep human 
sympathy. It is the story of a woman, more sinned 
against than sinning, whose lot falls among the 
outcasts, yet who remains in most of the essentials a 
good woman, and whose errors, although technically 
serious, are attributable to circumstance and environ- 
ment rather than to anything vicious in her nature. 
She is the child of respectable working-people in 
Columbus, Ohio. The father, a crabbed German of 
the strictest Lutheran orthodoxy, is out of work 
much of the time, and the mother takes in washing 
to support the family. They are very poor people. 
One of the mother's customers is a United States 
Senator, and it is the daughter who carries the 
bundles to and from his hotel. He is won by 
Jennie's beauty and sweetness of disposition, and

she becomes his victim. He folly intends to make 
her his wife, but his sudden death puts an end to 
her hopes, leaving her with the burden of an unborn 
child. Jennie is cast out from home by her angry 
father when her disgrace becomes apparent, and is 
thrown on her own resources. She goes into ser- 
vice with a wealthy family in Cleveland, and there 
attracts the attention of a visitor to the house, a 
prosperous man of affairs, the scion of a wealthy 
family. He persuades her to live with him, and, 
removing to Chicago, they establish a home appar- 
ently as man and wife. The man is himself by 
no means vicious, or in any way like the immoral 
seducer that makes a game of the pursuit of women. 
He is to all intents and purposes Jennie's husband, 
and nothing more than hick of determination pre- 
vents him from giving a legal sanction to their union. 
He has made for himself a home in which he is 
happy, and his moral sense is too blunt for him to 
realize that anything more is necessary. Mean- 
while, the social mill is slowly grinding out the con- 
sequences of this false relation. The man learns 
of the existence of Jennie's child, of which he has 
known nothing, and the story of her unfortunate 
past is revealed to him. Then his family and friends 
get wind of his domestic irregularity, and bring 
many kinds of pressure to bear upon him. His 
father's death brings a staggering problem. He 
must put an end to his illicit domestic establish- 
ment, or lose his rightful share in the gigantic for- 
tune and the business which has made it. He long 
hesitates, but finally makes the break, providing a 
country home for Jennie and her child. Then 
another woman appears, one of his own class, and 
precisely the one whom he had thought to wed in 
his earlier days. She throws herself at his head in 
such fashion that there is no evasion for him, a wed- 
ding follows, and foreign travel, and general social 
rehabilitation. Meanwhile Jennie loses her child, 
and eats out her heart in her solitude. She has made 
no scene, she has just suffered dumbly, admitting 
to herself that she has deserved it all. The closing 
scene is at the man's death bed, whither Jennie has 
been summoned, his wife being absent in Europe. 
And in her consciousness the future stretches out 
as a series of "days and days in endless reiteration, 
and then ." This is a very moving story, gravely 
proceeding to what, given the conditions of the 
existing social order, is its only possible logical ter- 
mination, and leaving the reader with a deep sense 
of the pity of it all, and a stirring wonder whether in 
some finer scheme of things, such a soul as Jennie's, 
even with her succession of haps and mishaps, might 
not work out its salvation in honor and peace. It 
offers one of these special instances which seem to 
defy the application of all the general principles of 
conventional morality, and which puzzle the mind 
that would base its sympathies upon a clean-cut dis- 
tinction between what is right and what is wrong. 
"Jenny's case," in this modern presentment, does 
not seem nearly as clear as the moralist would like 
to view it. 



The London Publishers' Circular" recently 
singled out, as Chicago's two leading literary insti- 
tutions, Tin. DIAL and Mr. Emerson Hough. We 
are not quite sure that our second choice (or first) 
would have been that of our English critic, but a 
new novel by Mr. Hough is pretty sure to take rank 
among the better products of current American lit- 
erature. We are inclined to think "John Rawn, 
Prominent Citizen " the best piece of work he has 
thus far given us. For one thing, it does not attempt 
to link invention with the facts of American history, 
a field of effort in which the author moves a little 
heavily and is not altogether convincing. Its back- 
ground is social and of the present time, which does 
not weaken the characteristically strident note of 
Mr. Hough's democracy. In the " prominent citi- 
zen " whose career he now describes he has given 
us a portrait of the sort of unscrupulous egotist who 
rises from humble circumstances to the proud posi- 
tion of financial magnate and captain of industry. 
John Rawn, after a humdrum existence which has 
brought him well into the thirties, gets possession of 
an idea, and exploits it at the expense of the public. 
This idea is nothing less than that which obsesses 
every physicist, the idea that the unlimited supply of 
energy which is stored in the ether may be tapped 
and made to supply power for all the motors of the 
world. Unfortunately for Rawn, the mechanical 
device by which this revolution is accomplished is 
worked out by his son-in-law, who keeps to himself 
the secret of its construction. Thereby hangs the 
whole complication of the tale, for Charles Halsey 
is by way of being a socialist, and he believes that 
the monopoly of mechanical power at which Rawn 
is grasping will bear heavily upon the people and 
make life harder for them. Nevertheless, he con- 
structs his machine, and it works so convincingly 
that capital is eager to secure it, and builds up the 
gigantic organization of which Rawn has dreamed. 
As president of this Company, Rawn soon becomes a 
millionaire, of which change of condition his transit- 
ion from a cottage in Kelly Row to a stone palace 
on the North Shore is the visible symbol. As his 
wealth increases, he hardens in his egotism, casts off 
the simple soul who has been his wife for many 
years, and replaces her by a beautiful stenographer 
whom he dazzles with jewels and the display of 
general opulence. In due course, two storms gather 
about him. One is in the business world, for his 
associates in the power scheme become suspicious, 
and demand that he "make good" with his motors. 
The other is in his domestic relations, for Halsey, 
whose wife has practically forsaken him, carries on 
an intrigue with Mrs. Rawn the second, who comes to 
despise her husband, and professes to be enamoured 
of the altruistic notions of her lover. The latter is 
kilh-l in a labor riot, the guilty wife fades from the 
picture, Mrs. Rawn the first turns up in the nick of 
time with the million dollars that had been given 
her as a solatium at the time of the divorce, and the 
story is hurried to a rather unconvincing conclusion 
which leaves us to infer that things will be patched

up somehow. There is a good deal of melodrama in 
this story and much crudity of coloring, but there is 
also dramatic action, and much forcible writing, and a 
general quality of virility that is fairly striking. Mr. 
Hough has a pretty talent for veiled invective and 
suppressed indignation. It is not difficult to perceive 
that there is a chip on his shoulder most of the time. 

Two historical happenings 'have been skilfully com- 
bined in the romance of " John Temple," by Mr. 
Ralph Durand. One is that of the Englishman 
despatched by Queen Elizabeth with a message of 
friendship to Akbar, the Great Mogul. The other 
is that of the luckless expedition of Barreto, which 
by cause of famine, disease, and treachery, failed in 
the attempt to make a Portuguese conquest of East 
Africa. By departing from historical fact to the ex- 
tent of sending the Englishman from Goa as a forced 
member of the African expedition, instead of per- 
mitting him to reach Akbar's Court, the author has 
provided the story with an English hero, for the pur- 
pose of enlisting the warmer sympathy of English 
readers. The expedition is shipwrecked upon the 
African coast at a point about seven hundred miles 
south of the nearest Portuguese settlement, and the 
narrative is mainly concerned with the toilsome 
march northward, with its attendant perils and en- 
counters with the natives. A Portuguese heroine is 
provided, whom Temple protects so valiantly that 
he wins her love, wedding her in the end, and remain- 
ing with her in the " great place " of the African 
chief whose power he has usurped. Meanwhile, the 
remnant of the Portuguese expedition dwindles away 
after Barreto's death, and what is left of it withdraws 
from the enterprise. The story offers a rather monot- 
onous tissue of incidents, for the author has not 
stooped to the cheap heroics of the merely entertain- 
ing romancer, but he makes us feel all the time that 
he is handling the real stuff of history, and that he 
has sifted the old chronicles to good purpose. He 
knows the country as well as the records, and his 
narrative bears everywhere the impress of essential 
truth. It is a grim sort of truth, uncolored by the 
imagination, but for that lack all the more welcome 
to readers who would rather get close to reality than 
lose themselves in romantic dreams. 

Mr. George Birmingham's " Spanish Gold " also 
links our interest with the Elizabethan period, but 
only because the quest of the treasure-hunters is the 
spoil of a galleon of the Armada, wrecked on the 
coast of an Irish island. Otherwise, the story is 
modern, and tells how the curate of Ballymoy and 
his friend Major Kent get track of the gold, repair 
to the island in their yacht, and have various diffi- 
culties with the natives, the representatives of the 
government, and a precious pair of rascally rival 
gold-hunters. The O'Flaherty (a native) bears off 
the honors, for he has long had the treasure in his 
possession, but the adventurers get a lot of fun out 
of their expedition. Mr. Birmingham is by way of 
being a humorist of the dry type, and his story is 
really one of character rather than of adventure. 
As such, it is human and diverting in a high degree. 



Two other novels by the same hand give evidence 
of the same engaging sort of humor. " The Search 
Party " tells how Dr. Lucius O'Grady, an impecuni- 
ous medical officer of the Poor Law Union of Clon- 
more, falls into the hands of the A. M. B. A., and 
how his determined fiancee, Miss Adeline Maud 
Blow, comes to his rescue. The initials betoken the 
Anti-Militarist Brotherhood of Anarchists, whose 
leader is one Mr. Red, who leases the old dower- 
house of Rosivera, several miles distant from any- 
thing, and occupies it with his minions. What he 
does there excites the curiosity of the Clonmore 
villagers, and even the reader is vouchsafed nothing 
more than a general impression that the place is a 
laboratory for the manufacture of bombs. Dr. 
O'Grady is summoned to Rosivera professionally, 
and becomes lost to the world. He is kept a pris- 
oner by the redoubtable Mr. Red, not unwillingly, 
because he is promised a handsome fee for each day 
of his sojourn, and he foresees the possibility of 
paying all his debts. Soon after his disappearance, 
Miss Blow appears in Clonmore, convinced that he 
has been murdered, and stirs up the authorities to 
investigate. She is the sort of young woman who 
knows what she wants, and gets it. When suspicion 
falls upon Rosivera and its mysterious tenant, various 
persons, from police officers to Members of Parlia- 
ment, seek out the place, and all are kidnapped and 
held in durance by the truculent Mr. Red. Finally, 
Miss Blow takes command, heads a search party, 
and discovers all the prisoners, their captor having 
made his escape. The literary value of this simple- 
minded tale is to be found in its delineation of the 
evasive Irish character and its satirical dabs at official- 
dom, as represented by the police and the visiting 
M. P's. 

Mr. Birmingham's third novel is entitled " Lai- 
age's Lovers," which is a misnomer, for Lalage has 
no lovers in the romantic sense, although toward the 
end of the book the Archdeacon sues for her hand, 
which she bestows instead upon the diplomat who 
tells her story. She is a piquant child, with tomboy- 
ish propensities, who develops into a young woman 
with a zeal for reforming the world. Her career 
as a school-girl, a student at Trinity, and a political 
campaigner, is suggestive of Shelley's early years. 
Like the poet, she scandalizes the college authorities 
by rushing into print, and society by her breezy 
way of taking a hand in the political game. Her 
"Gazette," the organ of the Anti-Tommyrot Society, 
has for its mark the bench of bishops, and her Asso- 
ciation for the Suppression of Public Lying brings 
confusion into the campaign for a parliamentary seat 
in which the diplomat (whom she has secretly marked 
for her own) is one of the contestants. Nearly all 
the electors abstain from voting in their disgust at 
her revelations, and the hero is defeated, greatly to 
his relief. With all these agitations and activities, 
Lalage remains deliciously childish, and originality 
is never lacking in her doings. This story is the best 
of the three with which the planet of the new Irish 
novelist has swum into our ken; its humor is the

dryest and the least forced. We shall hope to ex- 
tend oar acquaintance with Mr. Birmingham. 

The underlying idea of "Under Western Eyes" 
is that no amount of effort will enable Western 
Europe to understand the Russian character or to 
fathom its strange workings. We may study the 
Russian writers as diligently as we please and 
particularly the three great revealers, Tourgue*nu-tl. 
Tolstoy, and Dostoieffsky we shall always be baffled 
by a residuum of motive and action for which our 
Western intelligence has no explanation. Mr. Joseph 
Conrad, being himself of Slavonic strain, can do 
something to make us realize this difficulty anew, 
but he is frankly hopeless about clearing away the 
mystery. His new book is in the manner of Dos- 
toieffsky, and it seems to be quite the equal of " Crime 
and Punishment " in its psychological power. It is 
a very wordy book, forcing its analysis to the in- 
most depths, but that is a part of the scheme. Here 
is what he says of "the Russians' extraordinary love 
of words : " 

" They gather them up, they cherish them, but they don't 
hoard them in their breasts ; on the contrary, they are always 
ready to pour them out by the hour or by the night with an 
enthusiasm, a sweeping abundance, with such an aptness of 
application sometimes that, as in the case of very accom- 
plished parrots, one can't defend oneself from the suspicion 
that they really understand what they say. There is a gen- 
erosity in their ardor of speech which removes it ajs far as 
possible from common loquacity ; and it is ever too discon- 
nected to be classed as eloquence." 

The outpouring of words which supplies the ma- 
terial for the present novel is Razumov's journal, an 
imaginary record which has come into the hands of 
the author, who represents himself as an imaginary 
teacher of languages. All this is a transparent fic- 
tion, of course, and is merely the device by which 
Mr. Conrad has sought to give added verisimilitude 
to his narrative. He does not quote from the jour- 
nal verbatim, but draws upon it for the material 
which he fashions in his own manner. The story 
opens with one of those crimes of assassination which 
so disfigure Russian history. The murderer, fresh 
from his bloody deed, seeks refuge in the rooms of 
Razumov, an ambitious and solitary student with 
whom his acquaintance is of the slightest, and, un- 
invited, tells what he has done, and asks for aid in 
effecting an escape. Forced thus into an unwelcome 
complicity, Razumov realizes that all his prospects 
are imperilled by the dangerous knowledge that has 
been thrust upon him, yet nevertheless volunteers 
his assistance, and makes an earnest effort to secure 
for his guest the means of flight. But the plan fails, 
and Razumov, in a revulsion of feeling, becomes 
persuaded that self-interest and duty alike require 
that he should denounce the assassin to the author- 
ities. This he does, with the result that Haldin is 
arrested, tried and hanged, while his betrayer's 
share in the business is successfully concealed. In 
fact, a rumor spreads through revolutionary circles 
that Razumov is a heroic soul who has shared with 
Haldin the glory of the crime, and he becomes an 
object of adulation and reverence. Meanwhile, he 



accepts a government mission to go to Geneva as a 
spy, and report iijxm the revolutionary activities of 
the Swiss group of exiles. Here, by the irony of 
fate, he becomes acquainted with the mother and 
sister of the man whom lie has betrayed to death. 
and his soul is torn by love for the sister and re- 
morse for his treachery. His agonized conscience 
will give him no rest, and at last forces a confes- 
sion from his lips a confession first made to the 
girl, and then to the Russian conspirators, who at 
once wreak a fearful punishment upon him. I1U 
life is not taken, but he is crippled and his hearing 
is destroyed, leaving him to drag out a useless and 
miserable existence. Such is the outline of this 
searching story of a tortured conscience, and the 
story is told with a power and a penetration that 
make it a very remarkable work indeed. It has 
much of the best quality of the great Russian novels, 
and with it that element of detachment which Tour- 
gue'nieff alone among them was enabled to put into 
his work. We are inclined to say that " Under 
Western Eyes " is Mr. Conrad's masterpiece.

JJuiEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



To their series of translations from 
M ' Maeterlinck, Messrs. Dodd, Mead 
& Co. have now added " Death," a 
short essay spread out over one hundred pages, bound 
in a pale sunset-green that neutralizes the joyless 
title. But if death is joyless, it is not because M. 
Maeterlinck has made it so his essay primarily 
aims to rob death of its terrors. Complaining that 
we do not grant " one hour of our intelligence " to 
this flimsiest of human ideas, he sets out to make a 
sober and thoughtful study of death. First he bids 
us no longer associate death with the last struggles 
of life ; then not to associate death with the grave, 
which has its origin in man's mistaken ideals and 
not in death itself. These two terrors are not essen- 
tial, but ancillary and avoidable, and only one possi- 
ble terror remains that of the unknown into which 
we are plunged. Outside of the religious which 
he puts aside with dispatch rather than regret 
there are, says M. Maeterlinck, only four imaginable 
solutions: total annihilation, which is impossible 
since nothing can perish utterly ; survival with our 
present consciousness, which is absurd and in any 
case has no terrors ; survival without any sort of con- 
sciousness, which is possible and also has no terrors; 
lastly, survival with universal consciousness differ- 
ent from that which we possess in this world, which 
is again possible and terrorless. In any event, there 
is nothing to fear. Beautiful Death, gliding with M.t't 
feet, is of course not a new conception ; romanticists 
like Walt Whitman, who would fain embrace every- 
thing, have not failed to embrace Death. What is 
especially significant in M. Maeterlinck's essay, how- 
ever, is his calmness in setting aside the religion of

his fathers the impediment to free speculation is 
gone forever ; and, further, his complete aloofness 
from the question of the ages, the nature of good 
and evil. The whole problem of good and evil, it 
seems, is so baffling that we had better shun it en- 
tirely; far more poetic is the destiny of man if we 
are all of the elect. M. Maeterlinck's essay may bring 
comfort to the virtuous gentleman who reads Emer- 
son, Browning, and Maeterlinck in his library of a 
Sabbath forenoon ; but it is not for the world at large. 



TWO centuries 
of Berlin 
court life. 



In " The Ho . use of Hohenzollera : 
Two Centuries of Berlin Court 
L if e " (Button), Mr. E. A. Brayley 
Hodgetts has produced a volume which by those 
who care for the lighter phases of history will be 
found of considerable interest. The author has 
brought to the preparation of his book two very 
necessary qualifications. He knows his Berlin by 
prolonged residence in that city, for many years in 
the capacity of Renter's special correspondent; and 
he is utterly devoid of everything in the nature of 
prejudice against the Germans or things German. 
The purpose of the book, indeed, it is explained, is to 
contribute to the enlightenment of English readers 
with respect to the social history of their cousins- 
German and to assist in the dispelling of those illu- 
sions which are in part responsible for the Anglo- 
German tension of the present day. Beginning with 
a resume of Prussian history prior to the accession 
of Frederick I. as "king in Prussia" in 1701, the 
author writes entertainingly of the personal life and 
court affairs of the nine rulers of the Prussian king- 
dom during the past two hundred years, including 
the present King and Emperor, William II. Inci- 
dentally, he attempts to lay bare the forces and con- 
ditions which determined the growth of the autocratic 
Prussian monarchy, the principal thesis being that the 
situation of Prussia, "inserted like a wedge amongst 
races and peoples impatient to fly at each other's 
throats," early accustomed patriotic Prussians to the 
all but unquestioning identification of sovereign and 
nation. The query is raised though not answered 
as to whether the present Emperor may not be 
" slowly educating his people to the use of free insti- 
tutions and carefully teaching them to walk by them- 
selves." For the student of history the book contains 
very little that is new, or even worth while. It 
abounds in sweeping statements that betray the au- 
thor's lack of the historical sense. We are informed, 
for example, that it was the support of the Great 
Elector, Frederick William, that " made the acces- 
sion of William of Orange on the English throne as 
William III. a possibility" (p. 10). We are told 
categorically that, but for the statesmanship and 
genius of the Great Elector, " there would have 
been no Prussian state " (p. 17). An historical work 
which the author extravagantly commends (p. 258) 
is agreed by scholars to be of doubtful value. Fi- 
nally, it may be questioned whether a volume which 
dwells at such length upon the foibles and shortcom- 
ings of certain of the Emperor's ancestors may be 



expected really to contribute to the very laudable ob- 
ject which Mr. Hodgetts professes to have in mind. 

Sketches of From the rather obvious moralizings 

some English on life and duty and things in gen- 
personahties. eral, which have become familiar to 
us in Mr. A. C. Benson's recent essays, it is a pleas- 
ure to read through the biographical sketches which 
make up his latest volume, " The Leaves of the 
Tree " (Putnam). Brought up in the household of 
an English schoolmaster, who ultimately became 
Archbishop of Canterbury, and engaged in school 
and university work himself, Mr. Benson had ample 
opportunity to meet and know some of the finest 
minds of his time, from Bishops Westcott and Light- 
foot in the Church to Frederick Myers and Matthew 
Arnold out of it. The present essays are an attempt 
to make vital the personalities of the men they treat 
of and to form an estimate of their work. The inti- 
mate relationships that often sprang from the inter- 
est of the older man in the observant and intelligent 
youngster or stripling enable Mr. Benson to reveal 
sides of character hidden to the world. It is per- 
sonality that most attracts the essayist, and conse- 
quently those essays that most reflect personality 
are the ones that hold the reader. The sketch of 
Kingsley, whom Mr. Benson knew well, is much 
more successful than that of Arnold, whom he knew 
only slightly. The former essay is vital with the 
exuberant individuality of this shining exponent of 
muscular Christianity ; the latter is a rather labored 
criticism of Arnold's life and work. This criticism is 
mainly concerned with Arnold's religious opinions, 
though part of it deals too with his poetry. Why 
" Balder Dead " should be spoken of as a play and 
" Sohrab and Rustum " as a fragment is not clear. 
One feels, too, like questioning the statement that 
Arnold's is a nature " which dreads the fight and 
the struggle, the elements which to coarser and 
stronger spirits, who do not trouble thpmselves about 
the wounds they inflict, add zest to the things for 
which they fight," when one recollects the ringing 
final stanza of "The Last Word."

A lawyer-poet's 

memories of forty and of numerous other less famous 
eventful years, pieces, both prose and verse, now 
claims our willing attention as the writer of the 
posthumous memoirs, "A Retrospect of Forty Years, 
1825-1865" (Scribner), edited by his daughter, 
Miss Harriet Allen Butler. William Allen Butler, 
son of Benjamin Franklin Butler, who attained the 
leadership of the Bar in his own State (New York) 
and held various public offices, including the 
attorney-generalship under Jackson, was himself a 
lawyer of distinction, but more widely known as an 
author. His best-remembered production, " Nothing 
to Wear," which he contributed to "Harper's 
Weekly " in 1857, was reprinted far and wide, and 
even made its way into French and German litera- 
ture in translated form. Concerning this and his 
other literary ventures, Mr. Butler has much of

interest to record in his reminiscences ; but a leading 
motive with him in writing the book was, he tells 
us, to trace " the rise, progress, supremacy and de- 
struction of the slave power in the United States." 
Many public men and much national history are 
consequently brought into his reminiscent and nar- 
rative chapters, but it is his memories of his father 
and of his more intimate friends that glow with 
the warmest life. The elder Butler's unsuccessful 
attempt to start a law school in connection with the 
University of the City of New York the author 
regards as a novel experiment predestined to failure, 
forgetting that the Harvard Law School had suc- 
cessfully started in 1817, and that the famous school 
of Judge Tappan Reeve at Litchfield, Conn., flour- 
ished as early as 1784, not to mention the law pro- 
fessorships early established at various colleges in 
different parts of the country. The editorial work 
has been well done. Several poems and parts of 
poems are reprinted to illustrate Mr. Butler's style ; 
Mr. H ( > wells'- encomium of the most popular of these 
poems is reproduced ; and an appendix contains a 
number of tributes to the lawyer-poet's memory. 
Good portraits and other illustrations are provided, 
and a full index completes the volume.

theory of Bergson s " Laughter : An Essay on 

tte comic. tne Meaning of the Comic " (Macmil- 

lan), as translated by Messrs. Cloudesley Brereton 
and Fred Rothwell, all of Bergson's main works 
become accessible to the English reader. Of these 
the present small volume is by far the easiest reading 
for the layman, and in it the great French thinker 
gets far enough away from his main theme to indi- 
cate a general theory of art. It also exhibits his 
method of inquiry, and, in a notable degree, the 
poetry and richness of his style. Starting with the 
conception of the man who falls over a brick on the 
pavement, in the customary newspaper cartoon, on 
to the subtlest of satiric character delineations by 
Moliere and others, M. Bergson pursues the trail of 
the comic, showing incidentally the inadequacy of 
previous theories of its nature and effects. His con- 
clusion, in barest statement, is that the comic is the 
result of the human spirit being clogged in its pro- 
gress by matter, that wherever the soul permits 
itself to become checked, to fall into mechanical 
repetition, it there exposes itself to ridicule. This 
ridicule is a purely social phenomenon, and a purely 
intellectual one. It is society's weapon for disciplin- 
ing those minor breaches of her rules that are not 
great enough to bring down condigner punishment. 
" Its function is to intimidate by humiliating." 
While staider art, says M. Bergson, has the function 
of showing us individual and unique pictures of life 
pictures which we need because our intellect, func- 
tioning for the utilitarian purposes of life, can only 
give us classes and categories, never the unique. 
The distinction he draws, therefore, between art as 
art and the comic spirit, is that the comic spirit 
being of the intellect gives us again the type, the 



thing that we have recognized before and will recog- 
nize again. And it gives us the type that we may 
laugh it out of court. Like the foam <>t ill.- a. 
laughter plays on the surface of life only. Like 
froth it sparkles. It is gaiety itself. But the phil- 
osopher who gathers a handful to taste may find that 
the substance is .scanty, and the aftertaste hitter."

Stewart time,. (Crowell), Miss Edith L. Elias has 
covered the lives of fourteen rulers from Henry VII. 
to Queen Anne a matter of some two centuries 
and a quarter. In addition to the ruler*. Mi Klias 
has given us brief lives of thirty-eight of the prin- 
cipal personages of those days. In the first volume 
are sketches of half a dozen churchmen, from Wolsey 
to John Knox, including one foreigner, Luther : of 
four sailors, Columbus, Sebastian Cabot, Hawkins, 
and Drake ; of four courtiers, all of Elizabeth's 
reign ; and, under the heading "The Renaissance," 
of Caxton, More, Spenser, and Shakespeare. In the 
second volume, under " The State," are lives of nine 
men, among them the first Duke of Buckingham, 
Hampden, and the Earls of Strafford, Clarendon, 
and Shaftesbury ; under " The Army," Fairfax, 
Graham, Monck (all of Commonwealth times), and 
Churchill ; under " Religion," Laud, Jeremy Taylor, 
Baxter, and Penn ; and under " Science and the 
Fine Arts," Bacon, Wren, and Newton. It would 
be easy to complain of the omission of perhaps an 
equal number of men ; but those included all de- 
serve their place, especially as Miss Elias's purpose 
is historical rather than literary. The lives are all 
brief : Columbus has only four pages, Elizabeth and 
Charles II. only fifteen pages each, while the aver- 
age is about ten pages. Dates and precise details 
are given sparingly, for there is a constant effort to 
present the characters of the persons and their gen- 
eral relation to their times. There is one puzzling 
misprint ("In Tudor Times," p. 164): " It was a 
stupendous undertaking to diver his small craft 
down this tortuous passage." Should it be " drive" ? 
And there is one obvious slip (" In Stewart Times," 
p. 51): Cromwell's death "was less than two hun- 
dred years since the great Elizabeth had passed 
away." For the rest, the books are pleasantly writ- 
ten, and should serve to stimulate their readers to 
further interest in the periods treat---!. 

" An Army Officer on Leave in 
JP " (McClurg) is the account of 
a journey through Japan, preceded 
by chapters on the city of Manila, the Philippine 
insurrection, the island of Formosa, and interlarded 
with discussions of the origin of the Japanese, the 
history of Japan and its religions, and the story of 
the persecutions of the Christians in that country. 
The author, Colonel L. Mervin Maus of the United 
States Army, writes in a familiar style, lacking 
wholly in distinction, and frequently exceedingly 
loose. This style is in agreement with the quality

of the matter it conveys, for there is but little origi- 
nality in thought or information. Most of the sub- 
stance of the volume might be gleaned from the 
pages of standard books of reference, to which the 
author acknowledges his indebtedness. Yet the 
agreeable personality of the writer, and the thin 
stream of personal narrative flowing through the 
accounts of things seen and discussions of history 
and religions, render the book entertaining. A 
great portion of the information is conveyed in the 
form of disquisitions delivered by a well-informed 
"Major," who, together with a "Judge," happened 
to be companions of Colonel Maus ; and this device 
may aid in rendering the book interesting to readers 
whose chief diet is light fiction. With such readers 
the book will perform a useful service, for its facts 
appear to have come from the best sources, and its 
spirit of friendliness and respect toward orientals is 
wholesome for a large portion of the American pub- 
lic. The appendix, giving information as to routes 
of travel between the United States and eastern 
Asia, and the cost of such travel, is practical and 
satisfactory. . 

The aspiring art-student and more 
wifon or/ particularly the British art-student 

(for there are national ideals and 
national methods in art) will surely be interested 
in the practical side of " Art, Artists, and Land- 
scape Painting " (Longmans), a collection of infor- 
mal essays by the English artist, Mr. W. J. Laidlay. 
Chapters on art-subjects, ranging from such general 
topics as "Art," "Artists," and "Criticism," to mat- 
ters like "Composition," "Studies," "Materials," 
and " Things to be Avoided," make up this three- 
hundred-page octavo, excellent in paper and typog- 
raphy as one could wish. Unfortunately the book 
itself is rather a disappointment. The general essays 
are a well-meant but tedious pursuit of the obvious, 
and their weakness is not concealed by a didactic 
tone and a wealth of more or less relevant gossip. 
An artist, however, is not expected to be strong in 
aesthetic theory, and the advice Mr. Laidlay has to 
offer on specific details of practice is an honest and 
generous contribution to the science which, since the 
abandonment of studio-apprenticeship, each artist 
has had to learn for himself. After all, this volume 
is for the serious beginner in art; and if the author's 
lack of humor prove tedious to less serious people, 
they should remember the purpose of the volume, 
and not expect every one of last year's books on art 
to be as interesting as M. Gsell's " Rodin " or Mr. 
Cox's " Classic Point of View." 



An interpreter Mr ' Edwin BjOrkman, in a small 
of modern volume of essays entitled " Is There 

philosophy. Anything New under the Sun ? " 
(Kennerley), writes informingly on the teachings 
and personalities of certain leading contemporary 
thinkers, and optimistically on the meaning and 
values which modern thought and modern aspira- 
tion are extracting from life. The first three essays 
in the book are taken up with the author's own con- 



ceptions of life, which he sees as no mere product 
of mechanical or other blind forces but as a pur- 
posive activity bending matter and circumstances to 
the higher uses of the spirit. In these essays the 
influence of M. Bergson and his fellow apostles of 
the "6 Ian vital" is marked; and so it is no sur- 
prise, in passing to the second section of the book, 
to find a clear and appreciative article on the French 
philosopher who is being hailed as the world's great- 
est contemporary thinker, a philosopher who bids 
fair to do for Post- Darwinian philosophy what Kant 
did for the philosophy of an earlier day. The author 
is equally at home in his essay on William James, 
whom he describes as "a builder of American 
ideals." The last chapter is taken up with Mr. 
BjOrkman's views of "Art, Life, and Criticism." 
^Esthetics is so often considered from the standpoint 
of an escape from life following the pessimism of 
that master of aesthetics, Schopenhauer that it is 
refreshing to read the ideas of a critic who is free both 
from the cant of art for art's sake and from the oppo- 
site sin of regarding art as a handmaiden of moral 
instruction, but who sees it as an expression of the life 
spirit, serving the enlargement of life and having a 
standing as valid as that of science or religion. 

William Allingham's friendship with 

a wide circle f more r le88 f am . US 
men and women made him the recip- 
ient of many letters that have unusual interest for 
the reading public. In a volume entitled " Letters 
to William Allingham " (Longmans), his widow, 
assisted by Mr. E. Baumer Williams, has collected 
and published a considerable number of epistolary 
messages from a half-hundred and more of his 
correspondents, together with a few of his replies. 
But though we have his " Diary " to help us in 
forming some clear conception of the man, hardly 
any of his letters have been preserved which a 
reading of those now printed makes one regret. 
Among the sympathetic English friends who in 
such numbers conceived a liking for the Irish poet, 
and corresponded with him more or less familiarly, 
are to be noted William Black, Mr. and Mrs. 
Browning, Dickens, Thackeray, the Carlyles, Ros- 
setti, Burne-Jones, Leigh Hunt, Richard Jefferies, 
Charles Kingsley, Lecky, Martineau, Mill, Patmore, 
Spedding, Tennyson, Millais, Lander, and many 
others. Two letters from and three to Emerson are 
also in the collection ; likewise two from Hawthorne. 
From Rossetti only one is given, the others having 
been already published (first in the "Atlantic 
Monthly," 1896) under the editorship of Dr. 
Birkbeck Hill. An appendix contains three of 
Allingham's poems referred to in the letters, and 
other matters of interest. A portrait of the poet 
and facsimiles of letters written and illustrated by 
Burne-Jones are inserted, and a fourteen-page index 
ends the book. An agreeably varied assortment of 
letters, strung together most gracefully on a common 
thread of friendship, they present William Allingham 
in very attractive guise.

THE DIAJ, 



[Feb. 16, 



A ,tu<t v in the 



The title of Mis8 Charlotte E. Mor- 
gan's book, " The Rise of the Novel 
o f Manners" (Columbia University 
Press), is misleading ; the nature of the work is 
much more precisely indicated by its sub-title, M A 
Study of English Prose Fiction between 1600 and 
1740." The volume is mainly a historical and 
critical treatise of the English novel for the period 
intervening between the close of the sixteenth cen- 
tury and the publishing of " Pamela." This period 
is one of the dreariest for the history of fiction in 
all of our literary annals. But it was, for all that, 
a period of beginnings, and as such is not without 
its importance ; and it is one of the substantial re- 
sults of Miss Morgan's inquiry to show how large 
its influence was upon the major novelists of the 
eighteenth century in particular, upon Richard- 
son. The study falls into four chapters, the first 
devoted to the romance and anti-romance, the second 
and third to the novel (by which is meant the brief 
tale), and the last to journalistic and other popular 
fiction of the type of Defoe's pamphlets. A chap- 
tar of conclusions mainly a summary of such 
tendencies and influences as are discoverable fol- 
lows. And to this is appended a lengthy bibliog* 
raphy containing, among other things, a list of more 
than six hundred prose narratives first published in 
England between 1600 and 1740, with brief com- 
ment on each. The study is by no means exhaustive 
or definitive, it is, as the author frankly admits, 
" but a clearing of the ground in a field where little 
has been done and much remains to be accomp- 
lished " ; nevertheless, it affords the fullest discus- 
sion of the field that has so far been vouchsafed us, 
and must prove distinctly serviceable both to the 
general student and to future investigators. 

Mr. W. Barbrook Grubb, the author of 
"An Unknown People in an Unknown 
L^d" (Lippincott), is a missionary 
of the Church of England South American Mis- 
sionary Society, who has spent his life since 1889 
among the Lengua Indians of the Paraguayan Chaco, 
a region of perhaps three thousand square miles on 
the upper Paraguay River. He has devoted his 
time to exploring the country, learning the language 
and habits of the barbarous peoples, and winning 
their confidence to such an extent as to receive from 
the Roman Catholic government of Paraguay the 
title of " Commissary General of Chaco and Pacifi- 
cator of the Indians." As the result of his mission 
he has practically reclaimed this immense territory, 
opened it up to white ranchers, and trained the 
Indians to be useful servants of the world's indus- 
trial progress. Mr. Grubb 's book is an account of 
the people of this country rather than a record of his 
own exploits. The book is therefore not only a con- 
tribution to the heroic literature of missions, but also 
a contribution of value to the literature of ethnology. 
Appendices dealing with the flora and fauna of the 
country are contributed by experts. The illustrations, 
furnished by the ubiquitous kodak, are interesting.

Mr. Lewis Gaston Leary, author of " The Real Pales- 
tine of To-Day," is at work upon a new book, Andorra, 
the Hidden Republic," which is to be published in the 
spring by Messrs. McBride, Nast & Co. This firm has 
also in press "Windmills and Wooden Shoes," by Mr. 
Blair Jackel. 

Mr. Bernard Shaw has just finished a new dramatic 
sketch. The scene is laid in the time of Nero, and 
early Christians and gladiators, as well as Nero him- 
self, are among the characters. As might have been 
anticipated, Mr. Shaw's knowledge of boxing and pugil- 
ism is turned to good account. 

The final volumes of the Library Edition of Ruskin's 
Works, one containing the Bibliography and Addenda, 
with eighteen full-page illustrations, and the other the 
Index, will be published in March. The index volume. 
which has been in preparation during the last eight 
years, will contain about 100,000 references. 

Mr. Arthur Ransome has a volume in the press deal- 
ing with Oscar Wilde's work and his place in English 
literature. The book will be ready next month, and 
will be followed by companion volumes entitled " J. M. 
Synge: A Critical Study," by P. P. Howe, which will

The Collected Works of Ambrose Bierce 

Edited and Arranged by the Author 



4MBROSE BIERCE no living author has been so much discussed. Vet his name is not 
-^*- cried by the newsboys as they pass through the train vending chewing-gum and candy 
and "the very latest." His name is not " a household word " among the readers of " the six 
best sellers," nor is Ambrose Bierce "studied" in " literary" societies by young ladies. 

But no living author has been so much discussed by the men and the women that have 
made the literatures of the world of the past fifty years. No great living author may say that 
he has been uninfluenced by Ambrose Bierce. Verily this man has colored the literatures of 
his time. And he is still the master whom the masters study and revere. 

We present here extracts from a few of more than five thousand articles in our collection 
relating to his work and personality. 



BROOKLYN EAGLE: "The Neale Publishing 
Company has done the public a real service in prepar- 
ing a complete and handsome edition of the works of 
Ambrose Bierce. . . . His work will delight anew, as 
it long has delighted, the lovers of masterly English. 
The supple English language in his hand is both flail 
and scalpel and anon the lover's Into. He is one of 
the writers whom it is a joy to read." 

EDWIN MARKHAM: "The genius of Ambrose 
Bierce travels in many fields in romance, satire, 
poetry, fable, essay, criticism, epigram. We need 
not look into his books for the learned dulness of the 
academic Addiaons. Wherever we find Bierce we 
feel the working of a daring intelligence, of an orig- 
inal mind ; and we feel this even when we dissent from 
his striding and crushing opinions. . . . His ia a com- 
posite mind a blending of Hafiz the Persian, Swift, 
Poe, Tboreau, with sometimes a gleam of the Galilean." 

BIRMINGHAM AGE-HERALD: "In every page 
he has added to the dignity of letters and left his im- 
print upon the reading world. His satire and humor, 
his style and diction, rank him among the masters of 
English, and the new and complete edition of his 
works will no doubt have the effect of bringing the 
writings of Mr. Ambrose Bierce international renown." 

TORONTO MAIL: "This is a real addition to 
American letters, for critics everywhere are now vying 
with one another to honor Bierce 's qualities as a lit- 
erary artist. It is said in London that there has not 
been such a stir over the work of any American 1k-- 
tionist since Frank Norris took England by storm." 

GERTRUDE ATHERTON: "His place among 
the American classics is assured." 

NEW YORK SUN: "Mr. Bierce ia eloquent He 
makes notable phrases and knows how to construct a 
tale. He has striking imagination and effective humor." 

VANITY FAIR (London): "Mr. Ambrose Bierce 
is in the front rank of American critics, if indeed he 
doea not head them all. English critics have some- 
thing to learn from him. . . . Satirist, poet, soldier, 
literary artist in a dozen phases Bierce appeals to 
the discriminating reader. There are no better short 
stories in the English language than his In the Midtt 
of Life, but unfortunately these stories have become 
popular at the expense of his other works. ... If 
yon hare not read Bieroe's Devil's Dictionary you 
have a matchless pleasure before you." 



ROBERT BARR, in The Outlook (London) : " For 
years I have been a keen appreciator of Ambrose 
Bierce. ... I have written eulogies upon him both 
in America and England, and when his latest book 
came out I bought copies and sent them to a few of 
the great of the earth. ... I believe no one on earth 
can write so terrible a story as Ambrose Bierce can." 
PORTLAND (Oregon) TELEGRAM: "Indubit- 
ably the name of Bierce is one of the best known 
among literary men to-day. . . . Taking his writings 
' by and large,' as a sailor would put it, few competent 
to judge will contend that he is not one of the greatest 
masters of English this country has produced, that 
his rapier-like satire has ever been excelled, and that 
his war stories do not evince an imagination so terrible, 
so gruesome as to have an effect on one's heartbeats 
and breathing organs, while holding one's fascinated 
attention in close leash to the end." 
EUGENE FIELD: "It is our purpose rather to 
acquaint our readers with the pleasant fact that there 
has arisen in the literary world in the far, great, 
glorious West a new and bright star; that there is 
of us and among us a genius worthy of our recognition, 
our encouragement, our benedictions." 
THEpDORE F. BONNET, in Town Talk. (San 
Francisco): " Here is a man who has exploited every 
stream of humor that has ever enriched the literary 
meadows. A critic of literature, of government, and 
of life, he is at times as droll as Rabelais, at time* as 
caustic as Swift; he has vindicated the much-disputed 
maxim that ridicule is the test of truth; he has been 
as comic as Butler, as dexterous and aa mordant as 
Voltaire, as apt at the finesse of words as Pope. As 
a humorist, like Horace he has seen the absurdity 
of pedants, the presumption of political pretenders. 
Like Lucian he ban blended irony with narrative, 
taking his readers into topsy-turvydom to facilitate 
the flow of his acid merriment. Like Poe he has 
taken us into the realm of mystery and builded tales 
that enchant and bewilder. He has written poems 
that are triumphs of graceful expression and that are 
permeated with passion and enthusiasm." 
LOS ANGELES TIMES: "As a whole, they [these 
volumes] represent the growth and development of 
one of the most striking forces in American literature." 
MICHAEL WILLIAMS, in The New Age (Lon- 
don): "The goddess has not left him unrewarded. 
He has shaped certain works of imperishable beauty.'

The Collected Works of Ambrose Bierce 

In Ten Large Volumes 



COLUMBIA (S. C.) STATES : " The publication 
of Ambrose Bierce's collected works is an event in 
many ways, but chiefly it serves to introduce to the 
public a body of notable work in almost every field 
of literature. . . . Yet for almost a generation Bierce 
has been recognized in England, where he spent some 
years on various journals, as one of the greatest living 
men of letters. . . . He towers above all American con- 
temporaries in his chosen field, and his name and fame 
are certain to continue to grow in English literature." 

BALTIMORE SUN: "Ambrose Bierce, short-story 
writer, poet, essayist, critic, political writer, journal- 
ist, and, above all, powerful satirist, is one of the 
writers of to-day who are both very well and very 
little known. His works have been translated into 
every European language, including Norwegian and 
Russian. He has resided in California, Washington, 
and England, and has written brilliantly and much ; 
yet, while beloved of scholars, he is comparatively 
unknown to the general reader." 

GEORGE R. SIMS, in The Referee (London): 
" There are stories of Rudyard Kipling's that I shall 
never forget; there are stories in Ambrose Bierce's 
In the Midst of Life that I shall remember whilt> 
memory lasts." 

JOHN S. COWLEY-BROWN, in Black and 
White (London) : " Sir Henry Irving, Mr. Austin 
Dobson, Mr. Clement Scott, and Mr. George R. Sims 
(the last three his colleagues on Fun, before the humor 
of that weekly became the most pathetic thing in 
London journalism) will remember when Ambrose 
Bierce, under the pseudonym of ' Dod Grile,' stirred 
London thirty years ago as no writer had done since 
the days of Swift." 

THE TRANSVAAL WEEKLY ILLUSTRATED 

(Johannesburg, South Africa) : " It may take you 
half an hour to read one of his stories, but if you have 
read carefully and aright you are months older when 
yon finish it." 

SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER: "Taken 
as a whole, the publication of these ten volumes is a 
notable effort in the literary annals of America." 

SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE: "Space for- 
bids the notice adequate to an exposition of Bierce's 
many-sided genius, but it is due to say of the unani- 
iable Ambrose that as a combination of the essayist, 
short-story writer, and versifier he is without peer 
among living writers of English. . . . Just what his 
place in American letters is to be may not be fore- 
told, but his steadily growing recognition after hav- 
ing practically ceased writing argues that it will be 
a permanent one." 



THE ARGONAUT (San Francisco): "No man in 
America has a greater command over the resources 
of the English language, no man can better extract 
from it its uttermost possibilities." 

NEW YORK TRIBUNE: "These tales are so 
original as to defy comparison. . . . There is nothing 
like it in fiction ; indeed there is not one of the nineteen 
stories in Mr. Bierce's volume that is not remarkable." 

BRANDER MATTHEWS, in The Cosmopoli- 
tan : " Mr. Bierce has an astonishing faculty for the 
selection of the dramatic situation, plucked at the 
very climax and catastrophe of the dramr, and pre- 
sented briefly and boldly and left to speak for itself." 

PERCIVAL POLLARD, in his book of literary 
criticism, Their Day in Court: "Let me conclude, 
then, my appreciation of Ambrose Bierce ... I 
began my review of him with mention of his concern 
for our language; I can close it by reiterating that 
no man in our time has done more for English than 
Ambrose Bierce." 

HALDANE MACFALL, in T. P.'s Weekly (Lon- 
don) : "The dinner-tables will be a chatter this winter 
with talk of the artistry in letters of an American 
writer; his name is Ambrose Bierce. He has 'gone 
into' an edition de luxe over the water; he is being 
hailed across the Atlantic as the greatest living 
imaginative writer of prose. One can almost hear 
his name growing." 

WILLIAM MARION REEDY, in The Mirror 

(St. Louis) : " You may agree or disagree with him, 
but you can't resist the lure of his style, simple, lucid, 
nervous, compact, his unerrant selection of the right 
word, his way of saying exactly what he means, nor 
less, nor more.'' 

THE SEARCHLIGHT (Wellington, New Zealand): 
" His critical judgment is extraordinary in its precis- 
ion, accuracy, and sustained intelligence." 

ARTHUR BRISBANE: "Ambrose Bierce is one of 
the best writers in America, perhaps the best." 

FREDERICK TABER COOPER, in a review of 
ten pages, in The Bookman : " But to the connois- 
seur of what is rare, unique, and very perfect in any 
branch of fiction he must appeal strongly as one 
entitled to hearty recognition as an enduring figure 
in American letters." 

THE SATURDAY REVIEW (London): "The 
binding and printing are perfect, recalling the best 
productions of Colburn and Rivingtons at the begin- 
ning of the last century." 

THE ATHENAEUM (London): "Published in 
sumptuous style." 



In ten large volumes, containing approximately one hundred thousand words to the volume, 
the dimensions of which are about six inches wide, nine inches long, and two inches thick. 
Three editions are now ready : cloth, half morocco, and full morocco. The mechanical fea- 
tures of the three editions are identical save the binding. The cheapest set in its mechanical

A GENIUS OF THE THEATRE 

XJO publication of many months past is being reviewed so 

extensively and enthusiastically as Gordon Craig's book on 

the Theatre. Read the following specimen comments, selected 

from hundreds of reviews and letters then read the book itself. 

"In this astonishing volume the soul of the Theatre is articulate. . . . The author pulls the shrill and 
tawdry playhouses of two hemispheres clattering about our ears in dust heaps, and from this revolution 
he rebuilds serene and joyous temples for the aspiring mind. . . . Whether we agree with its author in 
whole, or only in part, or not at all, one startling conviction abides from the reading of this book : that, 
because of it, never again can we think of the Theatre as before." 

PERCY MACK AY K (Author of "The Scarecrow," "To-morrow," etc. i 

" Here is a man of genius and his book. . . . Mr. Craig is acknowledged all over Europe as a master- 
pioneer in the Theatre. ... If anyone doubts his genius, they have only to read this book of his. It is 
instinct with genius. On every page are illuminating flashes of thought, vista-visions, tangential flights 
of fancy, that betray a mind entirely different from that of the ordinary pedestrian thinker." 

THE NATION (London). 

"The book is dynamic. ... It is bound to shake us all broad awake, with the shock and challenge of 
unquestionable genius." JOSEPHINE PRESTON PEABODY (Author of "The Piper"). 

" Though it will arouse astonishment, anger, despair, on the part of some people, it must also arouse 
exhilaration, a glow of life, a desire to create on the part of others. Few who love the Theatre will 
know what the book contains without wanting to read it. When they do read it, different things will 
happen ; there will be all sorts of ideas that will conflict, oppose, combine. But out of such an apparent 
chaos it is, very often at least, that there arises finally something beautiful, harmonious, and perfect." 

EDWARD E. HALE. JR.. in The Dial. 

" It is remarkably suggestive and fascinating, and all students of the drama should read it with pleasure 
and profit" DAVID BELASCO. 

"Mr. Craig's book is tingling with force and radiant with health. It is full of courage, not only in attack, 
but also in adventure. ... It is a vital book . . . invigorating and inspiring. . . . Every word leaps from 
the page with all the dynamic nobility of creative force. . . . He has analyzed the evil of the theatre 
and stated it with a fearlessness infinitely refreshing in these days of timid thought, speech, writing, and 
criticism stated it also with charm and disinterestedness." THE OBSERVER (London). 

"If the stage were not soggy with inutile traditions, such a book would create a revolution. . . . Hopeful 
lovers of the Theatre will take it to heart as a momentous and stimulating volume." 

JAMES O'DONNELL BENNETT in the Chicago Record -Herald. 

Here, plainly, is one of those rare books that every cultivated 
person is bound, sooner or later, to read. Order it to-day from

AN EXTREMELY VALUABLE AND READABLE WORK 
ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR ITS TIMELINESS 



Principles of Economics 

By F. W. TAUSSIG, Professor of Economics in Harvard University 

Second edition. In two 8vo volumes. $4. 00 net. 
From the Banker's point of view: 

The book certainly is one of the most complete ever written in modern times upon this subject. 
At this period when every business man, banker, and voter is eager to serve all he can to help 
remedy some of the grave industrial perils threatening to swamp and overcome a powerful, pros- 
pering nation, this work will be of the greatest possible assistance in refreshing and awakening 
the mind to the present economic situation." Banker and Investor. 

From the Business Man's point of view: 

" Strict attention is given to that which is now of actual, practical importance. Especially timely 
are the chapters dealing with monopolies and monopoly values; centralized banking systems; 
crisis and industrial depressions; panics; labor legislation, including workingmen's insurance and 
damages for industrial accidents; the various railway problems, including public control and 
public ownership; combination and trusts; socialism, and a host of questions having to do with 
various forms of taxation. To the serious business man who is seeking an authoritative work on 
all of these subjects, which is not too elementary and still not too abstruse or technical, this 
book can confidently be recommended." New York Journal of Commerce. 

From the General Reader's point of view: 

We have the mathematical economist, the historical economist, the social reform economist, 
but too few are the common sense, the sane, progressive, practical, broad-minded economists who 
write for the intelligent citizen as Professor Taussig has done. ... It is late and just what the 
average citizen will be glad to read." Daily Courier (editorial). 

From the Earnest Citizen's point of view: 

" Professor Taussig has furnished a tool of value not only to the technical student of economic 
subjects, but also to the growing number of citizens who are seriously concerned with the whole- 
some growth of society and social relations along the path of justice." Boston Herald. 

"The book supplies a real and widely-felt need." 

" Professor Taussig is vital and unconventional in his treatment of his subjects. He draws his 
illustrations from our present affairs and situations, and he shows himself enlightened, responsive 
to the spirit of the age, fair and generous to theories or reform proposals which often, carried 
to extreme lengths, contain a soul of good. He has given us a refreshing, illuminating, compre- 
hensive and eminently profitable work." Chicago Record- Herald.

THE WORK OF THE DRAMA LEAGUE. 

The Drama League of America, organized 
less than two years ago, and engaged in its 
work of propaganda since the autumn of 1 910, is 
growing apace, and its influence is becoming 
more and more manifest in the field which it 
has chosen for its activities. It works mainly 
through the agency of women's clubs, and dur- 
ing its first year extended its enterprise into no 
less than thirty-one States of the Union, besides 
gaining members in Canada and in England. 
It has no paid workers, and the funds at its dis- 
posal are very limited, but with less than a thou- 
sand dollars of income it contrived, during its 
first season, to print and distribute 34,000 copies 
of its documents courses for the study of the 
drama, reading lists, and lists of plays for chil- 
dren. Its publicity work was also furthered by 
some five hundred Chautauqua assemblies and 
teachers' institutes, and it was the occasion of 
many articles in the periodical press. This is 
a highly creditable record, and makes clear the 
fact that the League is a force to be reckoned 
with in the world of the theatre. 

As is fairly well known by this time, the ef- 
forts of the organization are especially directed 
toward the discovery of the plays that are really 
worth while among the countless offerings of the 
theatres, and toward the task of acquainting its 
members and the general public with the results 
of its investigations. It aims to create, in every 
large city to which its work is extended, a sub- 
stantial and dependable clientele of playgoers 
who will be guided by its advice in the selec- 
tion of the plays which they go to see. This 
is sought to be done by an admirable system of 
bulletins, prepared immediately after the first 
performance of a praiseworthy work, and mailed 
to the members of the League, besides being 
posted in many public places. In Chicago alone, 
these bulletins last year were sent to many 
thousands of persons and were displayed in 
places where many more thousands must have 
seen them. Fourteen plays were thus bulletined 
as deserving of support not a large number, 
and probably not as many as might have been 
recommended, but enough for the needs of the 
average play-goer, who does not expect to see 
everything that is worth seeing, and must be 
grateful for having his attention directed to so 



152

many commendable works. To quote from one 
of the League's circulars, "so uniformly does 
this clientele respond to the call of the bulletin 
that managers have testified to the appreciable 
influence exerted," and " more than one man- 
ager has admitted that within forty-eight hours 
of the time the bulletins are in the mails the 
effect can be noticed at the box-office." We 
noticed the other day on the hoardings a poster 
proclaiming that a certain worthless production 
had n"f been bulletined by the Drama League, 
which seems in its way a fairly striking testi- 
monial to the usefulness of the organization. 

In view of the record of achievement just 
outlined, it is not surprising that the note of 
confidence, and even of jubilation, is sounded 
in the reports and prospectuses of the Drama 
League. It seems hardly too much to assert 
with its president, Mrs. A. Starr Best, that " If 
we can train the coming generation the au- 
diences of the next ten years to appreciate 
and support good drama, to refuse to accept or 
attend the worthless or unworthy play, the prob- 
lem of the theatre will have been solved. We 
shall not need specially endowed theatres to put 
on good plays the managers at large will have 
to do it themselves in order to secure an au- 
dience. If the audiences of the next decade are 
trained to know a good play and utterly refuse 
a bad one, the worthless plays will die an igno- 
minious death." The results thus confidently 
expected are to be brought about by a variety 
of methods, differing widely in their points of 
application, but all informed by a common edu- 
cative purpose. The work of the League is 
organized in numerous departments, and some 
of its collateral activities may be briefly indi- 
cated. It has a committee on publicity which 
aims to enlist public speakers in many fields 
to speak of its work, and a large number of 
lecturers have already pledged themselves to 
this kind of support. It has committees for the 
collection of press-clippings, for securing the 
cooperation of clubs in the planning of their 
yearly programmes, and for getting articles into 
the magazines. It has membership and finance 
committees with functions related to the in- 
crease of its budget. It has a committee for 
the preparation of study-courses in the drama, 
one for the preparation of reading-lists for 
students, and one for the guidance of amateur 
actors in the selection of their plays. It has 
a junior department for the encouragement of 
work with children, both as theatre-goers and 
as readers or performers of plays. It also plans 
to publish a quarterly bibliography of the cur- 



rent literature of the subject. These are some 
of the sections of a programme which in its 
entirety is fairly amazing, so curiously has it 
searched out the spots of least resistance in the 
apathy of the general public, and so intelligently 
has it provided for working upon them. 

Two of the projects of the League call for 
more extended mention. One of these is the 
determination to do something for the miserable 
dramatic estate of the small community which 
has to be content with the occasional " one night 
stand " of the travelling company. Whoever 
has lived in, or even visited for a few days, one 
of our smaller towns knows how hopeless it is to 
expect anything of a creditable nature from the 
local " opera house " and its recurrent " shows." 
From one end of the year to the other, no such 
thing as a good play intelligently produ< -ed is 
ever visible in most of these places. What is 
needed in a town of this sort is an earnest local 
committee bent upon securing sufficient advance 
support for worthy productions to make it possi- 
ble for their managers to bring them there with- 
out the certainty of disaster. "Walking the 
ties " is an exercise that does not appeal to the 
imagination of theatrical troupes, and an efficient 
local committee of Drama Leaguers should in 
many cases be able to see to it that the stranded 
companies are those that come without its encour- 
agement. " Organize the audience in advance, 
and make it possible for the good attractions to 
visit your town without loss," is the slogan of 
this department of the League's activities. The 
other project to which we wish to direct special 
attention is that of seeing that Shakespeare's 
birthday is suitably celebrated this year, and in 
the years to come. This project, already far ad- 
vanced in the case of Chicago, is one that should 
be applied to the needs of many other coiunnmi- 
ties in the future, until the twenty-third of April 
comes to have in the minds of the young an ap- 
panage of those delightful associations which 
remain fixed in after life. The utterance of the 
very name of Shakespeare breathes a benediction 
to all who have once yielded to his spell, and his 
anniversary is as well worth commemorating in 
the festival spirit as any of the others that tradi- 
tion has consecrated. Such an open-air pageant 
of Shakespearean groups as the school children 
of Chicago are preparing to produce about the 
statue of the poet in Lincoln Park is one of 
those things that lend spiritual grace to a com- 
munity, and appeals to all that is deepest and 
most reverent in human nature. 

These are stirring times for the drama in 
Chicago, which has never before witnessed any-

thing quite as interesting and significant as the 
present conjunction of the Irish Players from 
Dublin with the Drama Players of our own creat- 
ing. The visiting company is giving us an illus- 
tration of folk-art of the most absolute sincerity 
in the most admirable form of presentation. The 
work done by Lady Gregory's players indicates 
clearly one of the two chief springs from which 
the regeneration of the drama must come. The 
work done by Mr. Donald Robertson's finely- 
balanced company indicates as the other spring 
the insistence upon dramas that time has ad- 
judged to have permanent value. The two kinds 
of work complement each other, and together 
provide an object-lesson from which the public 
cannot fail to profit. It need not be said that 
the Drama League appreciates the opportunity 
thus offered for the practical furtherance of its 
aims, and that it is doing valiant work in arous- 
ing the public from its indifference in things 
theatrical, and in pointing the moral to be drawn 
from the two organizations in question. What- 
ever the financial outcome of the two experiments 
may prove to be, it will have been considerably 
bettered by the efforts made by the Drama 
League in their behalf. 



WANTED: A CITY-BUILDER. 



A great city ought to be something more than a 
lodging-place and restaurant for a million people. 
It ought to have a character of its own ; it ought to 
be an expression of the best thought and life of 
those who dwell therein ; its ways and walls ought to 
be a perpetual joy to them; it ought to be an inspi- 
ration as well as a possession, a pride and a shield 
against the rest of the world. 

Except the sowing and reaping of crops, there is 
nothing in the material way that men do more im- 
portant than building. It provides work and wages 
for many classes of men architects, artisans, crafts- 
men, mechanics, laborers. It furnishes them with 
hearths about which their lives centre, and gives 
them innumerable picture-galleries outside to gaze 
upon. And when the life and glory have departed 
from a place, the ruins of its buildings draw the feet 
of travellers to wander among them. They are like 
broken caskets where rich scents have been confined 
and still exhale the perfume of the past. Nature 
itself has no memories, but a ruined temple or tower 
ever makes a brave fight for its founders or its 
families against oblivion. 

The fascination of great cities, what a won- 
derful thing it is ! All roads led to Rome. For a 
thousand years or more its frontiers and its roofs, its 
theatres and its baths, its gardens and its thronged 
ways, glittered in the imaginations of all Europe, lured 
Gaul and Briton and Spaniard and African to the 



central hearth of the race. The " lights of London " 
flare to-day all over England, and draw to them 
a steady stream of human moths. The nation is 
emptying into the town. The urban spell the 
desire to be where life is fullest and brightest, the 
instinct for the society of crowds and the security 
of walls, the hope to breathe the intoxicating atmo- 
sphere where power and genius and art and beauty 
flourish, to be among them and have one's name 
blown abroad over the land, this enchantment 
works as powerfully to-day as it has always done. 
"In respect of itself," says Touchstone of country 
life, " 't is a good life ; but in respect that it is not 
at Court, it is naught." It takes a great mind or a 
heavy disposition to fight against the contagion of 
the crowd to refuse to be caught in the whirlpool 
current of city life. Tamerlane the conquerer sent 
for Hafiz the poet and said to him : " Bokhara and 
Samarkand are the great cities of my realm : yet 
you, you sir, say in a song that you would give them 
both for the black mole on your girl's cheek." 
" Yes," answered Hafiz, " and it is such liberality 
as that which has reduced me to the state of desti- 
tution you see." After all, the song, or the story 
of the song, has outlived the cities. 

This indrawing of a nation's blood to its heart is 
not the best thing for it, of course ; but it seems to 
be inevitable. Augustus is said to have suggested to 
Virgil that he write his Georgics in order to attract 
the Romans back to their old rural life ; and many 
statesmen have wrestled with the same problem 
since. Baron Munchausen's story of the black mag- 
netic rock looming up in the ocean, which, when an 
unwary ship approached it, caused all the nails to 
fly out of the planking and left the vessel floating 
in fragments on the waves, may be taken as a sym- 
bol of what happens to many, very many, of those 
who yield to the city attraction. 

But if human beings must live in cities, they 
ought to have the best kind of cities. Health, fit- 
ness, spaciousness; comfort and beauty in architec- 
ture ; and something more than a mere hint of nature 
in trees and gardens, are necessary. People left 
to themselves huddle together, as witness the 
many-storied houses of Rome, of old Paris, of Edin- 
burgh, and the narrow streets and courts of scores 
of other cities. There is undoubtedly a charm and a 
picturesqueness in the gloom and haphazardness of 
such constructions. The accidental is often happier 
than the designed. Baron Haussmann swept away a 
good part of the romance of Paris when he remod- 
elled that city. But democracy demands the best; 
it demands the healthfulness, the comfort, the room 
and privacy, which formerly the nobles only could 
obtain. 

It demands these things, but it does not get them. 
It is doubtful whether the multitudinous rows of tiny 
houses, as much alike as pins in a paper, or the 
gloomy blocks of apartment buildings whose funereal 
appearance suggests that they are prepared for the 
urns of the departed, are much better than the 



154 



THE DIAL 



[March 1, 



happy-go-lucky living-places of the past Better 
arrangements for health, they may have ; but their 
dreary monotony strikes terror into the beholder, 
and must reduce the vitality of those who live in 
them to the lowest ebb. One could only retain one's 
senses in them by being continually intoxicated. 

Worse, perhaps, than our domestic architecture 
in America are our business avenues, with their 
medley of all styles sham Greek, sham Gothic, 
sham Arabic, and the native dry-goods box set upon 
end and punched with holes. Our great public 
buildings have largely been kept respectable by 
being imitations, copies of similar structures abroad. 
At one time in our career we did build with charm 
and a certain originality. The old colonial erec- 
tions, with their simple lines and hand-wrought de- 
tails, stand out wherever they are found, in pleasing 
contrast with the furious and eccentric things around 
them. That America can ever produce an entirely 
new style in architecture, seems improbable; but 
some of our greatest buildings have an American 
note in them which differentiates them from any- 
thing done before. For instance, there is something 
in the great flights of steps to the Capitol at Wash- 
ington which recalls that oldest architecture of 
America, the pyramidal buildings of Yucatan and 
Central America. And the great feature of the 
Capitol at Albany, the transverse stairways of the 
facade, is simply a transmogrification and glorifica- 
tion of the old Dutch stoop, the dominant thing in 
colonial architecture both in Albany and New York. 

We have undoubtedly developed a new architec- 
tural note in the Babel-like towers of our great 
cities. Size is an element of power, and vertical 
height is the most impressive kind of size. These 
buildings are really impressive; under certain con- 
ditions of lighting or of weather, they are remark,- 
ably picturesque. But their details are generally 
bad, the details of ordinary buildings forced out 
of all proportion. And against them is their unsub- 
stantiability, apparent or real. It is a daring and 
inartistic thing to build towers and cliffs of cobwebs 
and lace-work. 

Modern inventions in transportation and com- 
munication have entirely changed the conditions of 
the laying out of a great city. With the telephone 
and the automobile, there is no reason why news- 
papers should not be published in sylvan dells and 
stock exchanges have their habitat on wooded heights. 
But probably convenience will always dictate that 
a city should have a central nucleus, a limited area 
devoted entirely to the business needs of the com- 
munity. But the domestic life of the people can be 
scattered over many square miles. 

Of all the purposes of public good to which great 
private wealth can be devoted, there is probably 
none open to fewer objections than building. A 
man who puts up a fine structure of any kind not 
only gratifies himself, but improves his neighbor's 
property and gives pleasure to multitudes who may 
live or come in view of it It seems a little remark- 



able, therefore, that among the possessors of vast 
fortunes in America no one has come forward to 
build a city of his own, from the egg u p. One of 
them might do what the great conquerors of the 
past did, or Constantine, or Peter the Great. 

Imagine a modern City-Builder acquiring, in a 
favorable and dominating position in this country, 
a tract of land a hundred miles square. It might 
stretch from the mountains to the sea, and have 
every variety and diversification of surface val- 
leys, forests, lakes. What a pleasure it would be to 
assemble together the directing minds of such an 
enterprise engineers, architects, landscape garden- 
ers, masters of sociological and sanitary science 
and with them plan the great design. Ordinary 
mortals haunt the cities of the past to draw from 
their memories sustenance for the heart and mind. 
In such a palace, we say, occurred this event of his- 
toric splendor and importance. From such a house 
went forth a romance which has warmed the world. 
At this tavern gathered together the wits and men 
of fame whose words are on our lips. But such a 
City- Builder as we imagine could almost dictate the 
course of events, could develop glorious and beau- 
tiful happenings, as we do novel or perfect plants. 

In the beginning it would be necessary to pro- 
vide means of transportation and communication; 
to lay out roads and sewers and subways. The 
Road alone has hardly begun to be treated with de- 
cent attention by man. What possibilities of joy 
are in it not merely in the roadbed itself, which 
may be supposed perfect in our dream city, but in 
its directions, its prospects, its enclosing trees and 
hedges and walls. Fruit-trees and flowers could be 
planted along it, free to all travellers. Bowers and 
seats and pavilions should be erected at points of 
best prospect or in places of secluded charm. 

For our dream city should be a woodland city, a 
park city. There should be a great many more 
trees and flower-beds than human beings. Means 
of transportation the most direct and most unob- 
trusive should radiate from the more solidly-built 
central mart to every part of the domain. But the 
people should mainly live in delightful villages, on 
mountain-side or in valley, by lake or sea. And 
though the architecture of the buildings and houses 
should not be restricted to one style or mould, there 
should be a harmony of conception, a toning together 
of effects, which practically do not exist anywhere 
to-day in the modern world. 

Such an ideal scheme might easily be realized by 
great wealth in the hands of a man of bold thought 
and unselfish devotion. But even if it is too vast to 
be practical, there is enough for such a man or men 
to do in transforming our present cities into really 
decent and delightful places of abode. Two-third >. 
perhaps, of the architecture of our towns needs to 
be swept away, for simplicity and beauty to take 
its place. Streets should be more beautifully aligned, 
and the woods and grass made to march over many 
squalid areas. CHABLES LBONABD MOOBE.

CASUAL COMMENT. 

BEWARE OF THE BEGUILING BOOK-AGENT, is the 
burden of a song that cannot be too often chanted in 
the ears of both private buyers of books and library 
officials. The February number of "Public Libra- 
ries " does well to print Miss Ange V. Wilner's cau- 
tions on the subject, as contained in a paper recently 
read before the Illinois Library Association. Sub- 
scription books, as has been repeatedly pointed out, 
should as a class be viewed with suspicion ; and when 
the subscription book is offered by an agent the wise 
person becomes doubly suspicious. "It is a fact," 
says Miss Wilner, " that the most expensive way of 
buying subscription books is to buy of the book agent. 
We all know how the bargain catalogues tell us of 
subscription sets, ' publishers' price $150, our price 
$80,' etc., etc. You may remember that in 1910 the 
Appleton Co. offered their New Practical Cyclopedia 
at $18 for the six volumes, selling only through book 
agents, but now they are selling the same work in 
the open market at $9.75." The cajoleries of the 
modern salesman, trained in accordance with the 
latest psychological principles as set forth by Profes- 
sor Scott and others, are indeed hard to withstand; 
but, as Miss Wilner further remarks, a later opportu- 
nity to buy at a reduced price the temptingly offered 
subscription book of real worth, will in most cases 
not be very long in presenting itself. Let us, then, 
harden ourselves to the blandishments of the sleek 
and plausible travelling salesman and patronize as 
a rule only our tried and trusty book dealer. 

THE AIRY HEIGHTS OF AUTHORSHIP, of exception- 
ally gifted authorship, where the proverbial "plenty 
of room at the top" is forever destined to remain 
but scantily occupied, must offer to the few and fit 
such thrilling mountaineering as no alpine climber 
has ever experienced. A significant illustration of 
the ease with which these heights are scaled by the 
properly equipped, while the less sturdy and agile 
are left hopelessly in the rear, is offered by a curious 
experience of Dr. Mitchell's that has recently found 
its way into print. " Hugh Wynne " was in process 
of revision, and the author, not yet willing to part 
with the manuscript, sent to Mr. Gilder an elaborate 
synopsis of the story, offering the serial rights to 
"The Century" on certain terms. Mr. Gilder re- 
plied that acceptance was simply impossible since the 
magazine was made up for eighteen months ahead 
and a novel by another author was about to run in 
serial form. Two other prominent magazines were 
then approached, with like results. Then the Cen- 
tury Company was offered the book for immediate 
publication, and it was accepted unread. Five thou- 
sand copies were printed and a few sample copies 
had been sent out, when some members of the staff, 
after reading the romance, appealed to Mr. Gilder 
(who had meantime been to Europe and returned) 
to find out why the story had not first been turned 
to account as a serial in the magazine. The same 
reply was made as to the author himself ; but the 



editor took a copy of the book and read it. Sequel : 
Dr. Mitchell received a telegram announcing the ac- 
ceptance of his terms, and serial publication began. 
What became of the other author and his crowded- 
out novel? Dr. Mitchell says he does not know. 



NOTABLE LIBRARY CONFERENCES OF THE COMING 
SUMMER call for some skilful manipulation of the 
library worker's engagement schedule, and, in most 
instances, some close economy of time and money 
in order not to miss the good things that are going. 
Foremost in importance to American librarians is, 
of course, the annual A. L. A. conference, to be held 
this year at Ottawa, the second Canadian city having 
the honor to entertain the American Library Asso- 
ciation, Montreal (in 1900) being the first. Then 
there are the various conventions of the State library 
associations, that in California at Lake Tahoe, June 
1722, in conjunction with the county librarians' 
conference, being among the most important. Fur- 
thermore, the yearly meeting of the Library Asso- 
ciation of the United Kingdom at Liverpool in 
September will tempt our eastern librarians espe- 
cially to indulge in an ocean voyage. Indeed, the 
honorary secretary, Mr. L. Stanley Jast, has already 
issued a general invitation to all and sundry American 
library workers to lend their aid, and their presence, 
in making the coming gathering an Anglo-American 
one. Toobtainfullparticularsconcerningprogramme 
and local arrangements the expecting attendant 
should address both Mr. Jast, at 24 Bloomsbury 
Square, London, W. C., and Mr. G. T. Shaw, the 
honorary local secretary, at the Liverpool Public 
Library. But how, one seems to hear asked, with a 
pitiful two or three weeks' vacation, and on an exigu- 
ous salary, is all this to be managed? Well, it is 

difficult, that's a fact. 



ELIMINATION OF WASTE IN EDUCATIONAL EF- 
FORT is of course desirable in every community. 
About a year ago the Council for Library and Mu- 
seum Extension in Chicago issued an instructive 
booklet on the " Educational Opportunities of Chi- 
cago," with a view to the better coordination of the 
work of the many institutions engaged in promoting 
the city's intellectual life. Two years earlier there 
had appeared in Buffalo a pamphlet entitled " Means 
of Education and Culture Offered to Day Workers 
by the City of Buffalo." And now Mr. Walter L. 
Brown, librarian of the Buffalo Public Library, con- 
tributes a further utterance on the same general 
theme. " Educational Unity " is the title of a paper 
reprinted from the January " Bulletin of the Ameri- 
can Library Association " after having been origi- 
nally presented at a meeting of the Council of that 
association. The quintessence of the whole ques- 
tion is found in the following passage : " It is diffi- 
cult to bring about a closer cooperation with the 
present lack of any central authority to exercise con- 
trol. We believe the time has come to ask at least 
if some means to this end cannot be found, so far 
as it concerns the various institutions which receive

support from the municipalities. It might, perhaps, 
he brought ahout through the forming of an educa- 
tional commission, which should at least advise the 
scope and direction of the efforts of such institutions. 
Such a commission might be made up of representa- 
tives from the governing boards of the different 
institutions, or the executive officers, or both, and in 
addition to formulating the lines of work, it might be 
a clearing house of suggestions for cooperation and 
extension." Mr. Brown's paper gives instance* of 
wasteful duplication of activity in his own city, and 
a thoughtful reading of it can hardly fail to carry 
conviction. ... 

TUB CALIFORNIA COUNTY LIBRARY SYSTEM* 
which has aroused such interest in the library world- 
resembles many of nature's most valuable products 
in being a plant of slow growth. From the latest 
issue of " News Notes of California Libraries " it 
appears that as yet only fourteen of the fifty-seven 
counties in the State have adopted the system, and 
that the current annual appropriations for its support 
range from fifteen thousand dollars in Alameda 
County to one hundred and twenty in Modoc. The 
number of branches maintained varies from twenty- 
six in Sacramento County to an inappreciable num- 
ber indicated by a blank in four of the other counties. 
It is not surprising to find the northern and central 
counties more active in this movement than are the 
southern. An examination of applicants for county 
librarianships has recently been held at the State 
Library and at the Los Angeles Public Library, and 
in this connection the following official announce- 
ment is of interest: "Experience has shown that 
only persons who have lived in the State and have 
done library work in a way to gain a personal knowl- 
edge of California conditions really understand the 
county library plan for California. The aim of the 
examination is to see how thorough is the applicant's 
knowledge of the conditions under which the county 
library work must be carried on, and of the problems 
to be met in the work as it is actually being done 
in this State. . . . And those who do understand 
what we are doing and what we hope to do, will not 
find the examination difficult" That personality and 
appearance count for something in the examination 
appears from the examining board's insistence upon 
a personal interview with the candidate an u oral 
examination " they call it 



AX INSTANCE OF LITERARY PIRACY perhaps 

already familiar to some of our readers is the cheap, 
paper-covered, wretchedly-printed " Love Adven- 
tures of a Milkmaid," with no indication of author- 
ship, appealing by the crude illustration on its cover 
to the class of readers with whom questions of author- 
ship are quite irrelevant The book proves to be 
a transmogrification of Mr. Thomas Hardy's story 
of nearly thirty years ago, " The Romantic Adven- 
tures of a Milkmaid," the typographical errors in 
the anonymous reprint being such as would probably 
make the author shudder if he were to encounter a 



copy which he probably never will. Nevertheless, 
though it may not be as gieat an honor to be pirated 
in America as to be lawfully reprinted by Tauchnitz 
in Germany, yet it ought not to be altogether dis- 
pleasing to find one's literary wares so valuable as 
to be worth stealing. Would not the elder Dumas, 
if he were alive now, enjoy the spectacle of his mul- 
titudinous cheap reprints, and even the sight of 
those sufficiently numerous novels, like " The Coun- 
tess of Monte Cristo," which enterprising publishers 
have fathered upon him just because his name is 
one to conjure with ? 

THE SEABOARD AIR LINK KRKE TKA VKI.I.I N. 

LIBRARY SYSTEM carries in its very name a pleasing 
suggestion of largeness and beneficence and of expe- 
ditious, businesslike methods, so that one conceives 
an immediate desire to be a resident on this same 
Seaboard Air Line of freely-circulating literature. 
The system was organized by the late Mr. St. John, 
vice-president and general manager of the Seaboard 
Air Line Railway, which binds together with ribbons 
of steel six of our Southern states where the scarcity 
of library facilities, and indeed of any sort of read- 
ing matter, is extreme. This first of free travelling 
library systems in the South, financially aided by 
Mr. Carnegie and enjoying the able superintendence 
of Mrs. Eugene B. Heard of Middleton, Georgia, 
has acted as a potent factor in bringing about library 
legislation in the six commonwealths concerned, and 
hundreds of small towns and of public schools have 
been moved to establish permanent libraries of their 
own. And so it appears that the big railroad sys- 
tem is not always and in all respects an all-devouring 
octopus of conscienceless greed. For further interest- 
ing details of the growth of library extension in the 
United States the reader should consult the late 
public document on that subject prepared by Mr. 
John D. Wolcott, acting librarian of the national 
Bureau of Education, and now separately reprinted 
from the current Report of the Commissioner of 
Education. . . . 

IN HER SECOND CENTURY OF LITEKARV ACTIVITY, 

Miss Caroline A. White, one hundred and one years 
young, puts to shame those of us who pusillaniniously 
entertain even the bare thought of beginning to take 
in sail at the half-century line, or at the sixtieth or 
even the seventieth milestone. Inthequietand refine- 
ment of her home at Upper Norwood, Miss White 
is reported to be still busy with her pen when the 
impulse to write visits her. A voluminous magazine 
contributor, she has put forth but one book, Sweet 
Hampstead," dealing with the historic, literary, and 
artistic associations of London's northern suburb, 
and enjoying sufficient vogue in its day to get into 
a second edition. Befriended and encouraged by 
Thomas Hood, Miss White sent her first literary ven- 
ture to Douglas Jerrold's "Shilling Magazine," \v hirh 
accepted it; and she recalls with satisfaction that she 
never had a manuscript returned either from that 
periodical or from " Ainsworth's Magazine." In the 
middle of last century she assumed the editorship of

"The Lady's Companion," and continued to edit the

interesting recollections of Hood and other writers 
of his time. ... 

NOTEWORTHY NEGRO SCHOLARSHIP that might 
well puzzle and confound the experts in heredity 
and eugenics was that of the late Edward Wilmot 
Blyden, A.M., D.D., LL.D., a native West Indian 
of purest Ethiopic strain, a rejected applicant for 
admission into some of our colleges about 1850, and 
soon afterward heard of from Liberia, as having 
gained an education there and risen to the presidency 
of Liberia College. The secretaryships of state and 
of the interior in the Liberian government were at 
different times held by him, also the commissionership 
to this country from Liberia; and after resignation 
of his college presidency in 1884 he took up inde- 
pendent work among the Mohammedans of Sierra 
Leone. Proficiency in eight languages, including 
Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and Arabic, was acquired by 
him, his specialty being Arabic. Author of several 
scholarly works and many lesser productions, he 
enjoyed the acquaintance of scholars of distinction 
and other noted men. What pre-natal or post-natal 
influence was it that so compellingly turned to lit- 
erature and learning this descendant of countless 
generations of African savages ? 



JANE AUSTEN ON THE AMATEUR STAGE, as pre~ 
sented recently by the Mount Holyoke College girls 
in Mrs. Steele Mackaye's dramatization of " Pride 
and Prejudice," is reported a more pronounced suc- 
cess than might have been expected, and indeed than 
was actually expected, in the case of a play so little 
dramatic in its action, so dependent upon portrayal 
of character of a not very demonstrative sort. Un- 
doubtedly the sympathy and the culture of the audi- 
ence contributed almost as much as the clever acting 
of the college seniors to the hearty enjoyment of the 
evening. The departure from the usual custom of 
presenting an original play lent additional interest 
to the occasion. The simple scenery required was 
designed and painted by members of the class, the 
chief outside help apparently being in the matter of 
costumes of the eighteenth century. Altogether, the 
preparation of the piece must have been to the stu- 
dents participating quite as valuable, in the way of 
education, as a formal course in eighteenth century 
English literature. 

A HISTORY OF THE BOSTON PUBLIC LIBRARY has 

been prepared by the librarian, Horace G. Wadlin, 
Litt.D., and published in a handsome octavo volume 
by the trustees. Beginning with the first agita- 
tation started for a free library by the mercurial 
Alexandre Vattemare, the philanthropic Frenchman 
who visited Boston in 1841 and conveyed to the city 
a gift of books from Paris, the history traces the 
increasingly rapid growth of the library idea and 
of the library itself down to the present time, with 
appreciative sketches of its deceased benefactors and 



officials of distinction. From the first librarian's first 
report it appears that, so far as was known, not " in 
any instance a wilful, and in only one instance an ac- 
cidental, injury was done to a book, and in the latter 
case the damage was voluntarily and cheerfully made 
good," and only one book was lost, and that was 
paid for. In the record of city appropriations for 
the library's maintenance for the ten years from 
1901 it is pleasing to note two instances in which 
the amount granted considerably exceeded the 
amount asked for, while in every other instance the 
response has been generous, either equalling or fall- 
ing but little short of the demand. The people of 
Boston value their splendid library and give it their 
loyal support. Excellent portraits and views, with 
a map showing the location of the library and its 
branches and stations, and a full index, are note- 
worthy features of this elaborate account of our 
oldest large public library. 
. 

THE MULTIPLICATION OF ADVANCED STUDIES, 

which in the last decade surpasses all that was un- 
dertaken of that sort in the preceding century, still 
goes forward in a kind of geometrical progression. 
At the University of Wisconsin alone the seeker for 
special knowledge is lured by such variously attract- 
ive courses as these lately announced for the second 
semester of the year: Semitic epigraphy, the his- 
torical background of the gospels, the appreciation 
of Latin poetry, the topography of Rome, the phil- 
osophy of art, typical theories of life, contemporary 
Asiatic politics, European government, industrial 
evolution, the distribution of wealth, the biology of 
water supply, practical hygiene and sanitation, indus- 
trial bacteriology, journalism for technical students, 
the teaching of English composition, collodial chem- 
istry, advanced geography, and a graduate course in 
geology. Thus, but in greater wealth of detail than 
can here be indicated, do star-eyed science, divine 
philosophy, and the delights of literature combine 
to promote the intellectual life in this our so-called 
materialistic age. 

THE INTRICACIES OF COPYRIGHT are enough to 
bewilder the average person. The new British Copy- 
right Act, as printed for circulation by the Society 
of Authors, fills seventeen large pages of rather fine 
print, divided into sections, sub-sections, and sub- 
sub-sections. Among the manifold provisions of this 
praiseworthy act the eye alights on such minutely 
particular, but probably not too particular, clauses 
as the following: '"Infringing,' when applied to a 
copy of a work in which copyright subsists, means 
any copy, including any colorable imitation, made 
or imported in contravention of the provisions of 
this Act." " For the purposes of the provisions of 
this Act as to residence, ,an author of a work shall be 
deemed to be a resident in the parts of His Majesty's 
dominions to which this Act extends if he is domi- 
ciled within any such part." And all these clauses, 
and subsidiary clauses, were needed merely to assert 
a workman's right to the product of his toil!

COMMUNICA TIONS. 



A MODEL JAPANESE POEM. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
It is, no doubt, well understood, in literary circles in 
America, that a Japanese poem is, like Japanese art, 
quite unique. In fact, versification in Japan is con- 
sidered one of the fine arts. And " versification" is an 
appropriate term, for a Japanese poem is generally manu- 
factured. There are certain very rigid forms, and only 
a few, for verse; and these forms are well known by all 
fairly educated Japanese. In schools, moreover, the 
Japanese are carefully taught both the theory and the 
practice of versification. Therefore, it may be said that, 
in Japan, poeta et ncutcitur etjit. 

The most common form of a Japanese poem is that 
called tanka, or "tiny ode," which consists of only thirty- 
one syllables, arranged in five verses of respectively five, 
seven, five, seven and seven syllables. Such a brief 
poem must necessarily be quite concise and suggestive 
or impressionistic. It has been truly said that a Japan- 
ese poem is a picture, or even only the outline of a pic- 
ture, to be filled in by the imagination. And this must 
be even more positively affirmed of the hokku, which 
contains only the seventeen syllables of the first three 
verses of the tanka. And yet it is possible to express, 
or rather to suggest, a very beautiful scene in only 
seventeen syllables. One excellent example of this tini- 
est form is the following: 

"Kare-eda ni 

U no tomari keri 

Aki no kmv." 

Which means literally: 

" On a withered branch 
A crow 's perching 
An autumn evening." 

It does not take a very strong imagination to fill out 
that picture. 

For an example of the longer form, I should like to 
present one which received high honors at the recent 
Imperial Poetry Contest in the Palace. The subject 
given out by His Imperial Majesty was " A Crane on a 
Pine," although, from the indefiniteness of Japanese 
words, either or both of those nouns might be plural. 
Over 29,000 tnnkn on this subject were sent in to the 
Imperial Household Department; but only fifty-eight 
were selected as eminently worthy, and only twenty-one 
enjoyed the rare distinction of being read in the presence 
of His Majesty. Among these was one by an old man, 
a primary school teacher in the country; it reads as 
follows: 

" Ash i t at MI mo 

Moto wo wasurenu 

Kokoro yori 

Su-tachishi matsu wa 

Taezu touramu." 

Now, it may be well to proceed with an analysis of 
this poem word by word, somewhat in the present fash- 
ion of parsing ad nauseam and dissecting to pieces the 
real masterpieces of English literature. In this case, 
however, such a course is quite necessary to an appre- 
ciation of the conciseness and suggestiveiiess of this 
" tiny ode." 

" AshitaUu " is a poetical word for " crane "; " mo " 
is emphatic and means "also" or "even"; "moto" is 
"origin" or "birthplace"; "wo" is the sign of the 
objective case; "wasurenu" means "forgetting-not "; 



"kokoro" is " heart" or "desire"; y.,ri " is a post- 
position meaning "from"; " su-tachishi"" means M nest- 
left"; "matsu" is "pirn-"; "wa" is an t-mpliatir 
particle, often indicating the subject, or tin- important 
word, of a sentence; "taezu" means "continually," 
"constantly"; and "touramu" means "visit." 

A literal translation, verse by verse, with the same 
number of syllables in each line as in the original, reads 
as follows: 

" The old crane alao, 
Forgetting not his birthplace, 
Very willingly 

The pine with the nest he left 
Continually visits." 

Professor Murata, one of my colleagues in the First 
Higher School, has favored me with a poetical transla- 
tion, as follows: 

" The crone, forgetting not his dear old home. 
Oft comes unto the nest on yonder pine 
Wherein hia mother taught him tir-t to fly."

ST. ANTHONY'S SERMON TO THE FISHI-X 

(To the Editor of THB DIAL.) 

In the Warner Library of American Literature, Vol. 
X I.I., page 16,700, appears a poem perhaps doggerel 
in form entitled "St. Anthony's Sermon to Fishes," 
which is marked "anonymous." It opens as follows: 
" Saint Anthony, at church, 
Was left in the lurch ; 
So he went to the ditches 
And preached to the fishes," etc. 

Most of the verses end with the refrain: 

" No sermon beside 

"Had the carps" (eels, pikes, etc.) "so edified." 
Though when the sermon is ended, it come> to this: 

" Much delighted were they 

But preferred the old way." 

I once had what was, on the whole, a much worthier ren- 
dition of this legendary tale just a waif clipped from 
some paper, which is now hopelessly lost. Kithn 
the same author tried again; or one writer's scheme was 
before the other; or, as is most probable, both trans- 
lated quite literally from some foreign source. A^ I 
remember, that too was anonymous, but it began: 
" Saint Anthony, one day, found the church empty Sunday, 

So he goes to the river, a discourse to deliver." 
Then it details how the fish 

" Came swimming and squirming in shoals to the sermon." 
In this form, however, the common refrain is 

" But all said they never 
Heard sermon so clever." 

Even when the carps " went back to their carping," 
the eels to good living," the pikes to their thieving," 
etc., 

Yi-t all said they never 

Heard sermon so clever." 

I should be very glad to know from any of your readers 
where the latter form of the poem can be found, or to 
see it reproduced, still more to learn win-nee, if it can 
be ascertained, the two were derived or translated, as 
embodying the quaint old legend of the good saint of 
Padua.

A HERITAGE OF AMERICAN 
PERSONALITY.* 



If in this era, when our minds are bent upon 
peace, there be anything we can find to admire 
in war, it is that nobility in human character 
which the dire stress of conflict sometimes re- 
veals. What chiefly we look for in battle is 
murderous hatred ; the more, then, can we appre- 
ciate those spirits which touch its pitch and yet 
are not denied, which radiate instead an unsus- 
pected "sweetness and light." Our American 
Civil War is one of the awful tragedies of his- 
tory ; yet from it rise two personalities that go 
far to redeem the havoc of the struggle. We 
shall never think back upon that time without a 
shudder ; yet we shall never forget that it gave 
us Lincoln and Lee. 

The character of Lincoln, though by no means 
universally understood, has been studied from 
many angles and appraised at something near 
its proper value. Not so with Lee. The South- 
ern chieftain has been viewed in the main from 
but two standpoints, and these have been more 
or less extreme. The average man in the North 
has had a conception of him hardly flattering ; 
the average man in the South has had a dif- 
ferent conception, but one not much closer to 
the truth. Too few have thought of Lee in 
connection with our national life and traditions. 
Something more than a year ago the present 
writer expressed the belief that " if the Ameri- 
can people would repair their greatest neglect 
of the legacy derivable from a single character 
in their history, they would have to acquaint 
themselves thoroughly with the real nature of 
Lee." At that time there was but one volume 
on Lee the " Recollections and Letters " by his 
son which offered the means of adequate in- 
sight ; and this volume afforded the material for 
judgment rather than the final utterance itself. 
Recently, however, two books have appeared, 
which, taken together, are well-nigh if not en- 
tirely definitive. They are complementary to 
each other ; they issued from the press almost 
simultaneously ; one is the work of a "F. F. V." 
student of Lee's, while the other was written by 
a descendant of a well-known family of Massa- 
chusetts abolitionists. 

Mr. Page's volume was begun as an enlarge- 



* ROBERT E. LEE: MAN AND SOLDIER. By Thomas 
Nelson Page. With portrait and maps. New York : Charles 
Scribner's Sons.

trated. Boston : Houghton Mifflin Co. 



ment of his previous work, " Robert E. Lee, the 
Southerner." It did not stop with that, how- 
ever ; it " finally assumed the proportions of 
a biography " an unusually full and fascinat- 
ing one. It adds to the treatment of Lee's per- 
sonal character, the theme of the earlier book, 
an elaborate study of his military career and of 
his relation to the civil power of the Confed- 
erate Government." 

It has, unfortunately, some faults, both ex- 
ternal and internal. The former are due to a 
slight carelessness in the details of literary com- 
position. They are partly excused by the large- 
ness of the author's undertaking; but surely 
so good a literary artist as Mr. Page should not 
perpetrate a sentence such as " No more were 
Jackson or Johnston," nor should he head a chap- 
ter " Lee's Audacity Antietam and Chancel- 
lorsville," when the chapter is devoted in toto 
to the first-named battle. He has, further, a 
provoking habit largely to be explained by his 
method of arrangement of discussing a given 
point on the instalment plan, with long inter- 
vals of foreign matter between the several instal- 
ments. Readers would be better satisfied if the 
explanation of such questions as Hooker's inde- 
cision at Chancellorsville and Grant's relations 
with Butler were concentrated in single passages 
instead of being dispersed over much space. 

The internal faults are more serious, because 
they impair in some measure the high value of 
the volume. Mr. Page disclaims any purpose 
of panegyric, and his attitude toward the peo- 
ple of the North is that which Charles Francis 
Adams, Lincoln's minister to Great Britain, 
expressed toward Southerners : " They also are 
my countrymen." Yet one cannot help feeling 
that he holds a brief for Lee and for Virginia. 
His contention that final success is not the test 
of military genius is, in the light of his refer- 
ence to Hannibal and Napoleon, reasonable 
enough ; but we may admit Lee's greatness with- 
out maintaining that his generalship was flaw- 
less. The study of Lee 's character shows the 
same tendency to exaggerate : Lee comes about 
as near the ideal as anyone could wish, but he 
was a real human being after all. And why so 
many commendations of Virginia, when the ob- 
ject of our scrutiny is the individual hero ? Mr. 
Page halts between two opinions : he wishes to 
show us the great superiority of the man, and 
at the same time he is anxious to bring up the 
State to the same exalted height. Our sus- 
picions are aroused when we read, " Lee's char- 
acter I deem absolutely the fruit of the Vir- 
ginian civilization which existed in times past."

[ March 1, 



Then follow statements that we cannot recon- 
cile. He calls Lee " The noblest gentleman of 
our time "; yet elsewhere he asserts that " noble 
as he was, ten thousand gentlemen marched be- 
hind him who, in all the elements of private 
character, were his peers." It is a pity that 
fervor and a divided purpose mar in some de- 
gree the fine disinterestedness and symmetry of 
the work. 

But when these reservations have been made, 
there is still a vast deal in the volume which is 
altogether praiseworthy. The accounts of Lee's 
various campaigns are full and interesting. By 
a happy device, the author sketches the main 
outlines of each, then tells of it again at much 
greater length, in painstaking detail, and with 
constant attention to the exact movements of 
each corps and division. In this way general 
information is followed by that which is minute, 
and the reader need not stop for the latter un- 
less he chooses. Along with the operations in 
the field is unfolded a knowledge of the extra- 
ordinary difficulties under which Lee labored. 
It is something of a revelation to learn how 
great an advantage the Union forces possessed 
in having a navy constantly at their disposal. 
It is equally surprising to know how important 
it was to the Confederacy to protect the Trede- 
gar Iron Works at Richmond. More astonish- 
ing still is the information we obtain of how Lee 
was hampered by the inefficiency of the Con- 
federate government. The government had 
theories about making the war one of pure de- 
fense ; it hoped that by refusing to ship cotton 
to Europe it could force recognition ; it tried to 
hold the entire country, instead of concentrat- 
ing its armies ; it insisted that the army elect 
its officers ; it failed to punish desertion ; it for- 
bade Lee to pick bis own chief of staff ; it 
cramped his strategy by forcing him to submit 
his plans for approval ; and it managed miser- 
ably the forwarding of supplies. Mr. Page 
maintains that Lee would certainly have made 
a third invasion of the North had his troops had 
proper shoes and clothing, and that he would 
have struck Grant a fatal blow in the Wilder- 
ness had not his men been so widely dispersed 
for subsistence. In the face of such obstacles, 
and of well-equipped armies numerically stronger 
than his own, Lee's struggle was truly heroic 
and pathetic. 

The key to Lee's character Mr. Page finds 
in its likeness to that of Washington, Lee's 
model. He was a humane, self-sacrificing, 
pious man if possible, more pious even than 
Jackson. The secret of his life lay in his re- 



liance on God and in the precepts he conveyed 
to his son: "To be obedient to all authority, 
and to do his duty in everything, great or 
small." His serene dignity and purpose to serve 
shone forth resplendent in defeat. " He was 
indicted for treason by a grand jury composed 
partly of negroes"; u to his death he remain. <! 
* a prisoner on parole.' " Yet he set calmly about 
his task of healing discord and building up the 
devastated South. High positions and large 
salaries were offered him " everything," said 
his daughter, " but the only thing he will ac- 
cept: a place to earn honest bread while en- 
gaged in some useful work." Finally he l>ecame 
president of a struggling denominational college, 
and gave the rest of his life to its betterment and 
that of its students. His salary was only $1,500 
a year ; but he rejected another offer of lucra- 
tive employment with these words : " I have led 
the young men of the South in battle ; I have 
seen many of them die on the field ; I shall de- 
vote my remaining energies to training young 
men to do their duty in life." 

Mr. Bradford, far more than Mr. Page, has 
the sense of Lee's character as a part of our 
national inheritance. He regards it not as a 
sectional but as our common possession. His 
dedication reads: 

' To the young men both of the North and of the 
South who can make or unmake the future of the 
America of Washington, of Lincoln, and of Lee." 

Three other passages that I cannot forbear quot- 
ing at length show the depth of his insight and 
the rightness of his attitude : 

"Abandon all these local animosities, and make your 
sons Americans. What finer sentence could be inscribed 
on the pedestal of Lee's statue than that ? Americans ! 
All the local animosities forgiven and forgotten, can we 
not say that he too, though dying only five years after 
the terrible struggle, died a loyal, a confident, a hope- 
ful American, and one of the very greatest ? " 

One was a man of the eighteenth century, the other 
of the nineteenth; one of the old America, the other of 
the new. Grant stands for our modern world, with its 
rough business habits, its practical energy, its desire to 
do things no matter how, its indifference to the sweet 
grace of ceremony and dignity and courtesy. Lee had 
the traditions of an older day, not only its high beliefs, 
but its grave stateliness, its feeling that the way of doing 
things was almost as much as the thing done. In short, 
Grant's America was the America of Lincoln, Lee's the 
America of Washington. It is in part because of thU 
difference, and because I would fain believe that with- 
out loss of the one we may some day regain something 
of the other, that I have given so much thought to the 
portrayal of Lee's character and life." 

" America in the twentieth century worships success, 
is too ready to test character by it, to be blind to those 
faults success hides, to those qualities that can do with-

out it. Here was a man who failed grandly, a man 
who said that ' human virtue should be equal to human 
calamity,' and showed that it could be equal to it, and 
so, without pretense, without display, without self- 
consciousness, left an example that future Americans 
may study with profit as long as there is an America. 

" A young sophomore was once summoned and gently 
admonished that only patience and industry would 
prevent the failure that would inevitably come to him 
through college and through life. 

" 'But, General, you failed,' remarked the sophomore, 
with the inconceivable ineptitude of sophomores. 

"'I hope that you may be more fortunate than I,' 
was the tranquil answer. 

" Literature can add nothing to that." 

In reaching an understanding of Lee's char- 
acter, Mr. Bradford has discarded legend and 
engaged in exhaustive research. " A complete 
bibliography of sources," he declares, " would 
be practically a bibliography of the war litera- 
ture both Northern and Southern." Yet he does 
not present, as does Mr. Page, in epic narrative 
a multitude of facts about Lee's career. Nor 
does his familiarity with the background of gen- 
eral conditions upon which Lee's actions were 
projected his knowledge of the social and 
moral issues, and of the larger phases of the 
technical and administrative problems lure 
him from his peculiar theme. Happily, we are 
promised the fruitage of these by-studies in a 
subsequent volume, " Portraits of the Confed- 
eracy." Wise readers will not expect the forth- 
coming studies to reveal any such ideal as Lee. 
The other leaders had merits and weaknesses : 
we may be sure Mr. Bradford will be blind to 
neither. He will show the men as they were, 
and that is all we can ask. 

Here, as I have suggested, Mr. Bradford has 
made it his purpose to portray Lee's soul. He 
has shown this in the various relations suggested 
by the titles of all the chapters save one : " The 
Great Decision," "Lee and Davis," "Lee and 
the Confederate Government," " Lee and his 
Army,' ; "Lee and Jackson," "Lee in Battle," 
"Lee as a General," "Lee's Social and Domes- 
tic Life," " Lee's Spiritual Life," and " Lee 
after the War." It will be seen that Mr. Brad- 
ford falls in with the new school of writers who 
in their treatment of historical figures lay stress 
upon character rather than upon deeds. So 
vital and so valuable is this aim, and so suc- 
cessful is Mr. Bradford in carrying it out, that 
readers will be especially interested in his own 
comments on his method of approach. These 
comprise an attractive and illuminating ap- 
pendix, " Lee and Psychography." He says : 

" What I have aimed at in this book is the portrayal 
of a soul. We live in an age of names, and a new name 
has recently been invented psychography. This means, 



I suppose, an art which is not psychology, because it 
deals with individuals, not general principles, and is not 
biography, because it swings clear of the formal sequence 
of chronological detail, and uses only those deeds and 
words and happenings that are spiritually significant." 

After explaining the dangers, both subjective 
and objective, that threaten the psychographer's 
poise, he maintains that the chief advantage in 
studying great men is in finding their resem- 
blance to ordinary mortals. He parts company 
with the believers in Lee's absolute perfection 
when he shows us that Lee was the barest trifle 
aloof, and that the invasion proclamations were 
prompted by sound common-sense as well as by 
lofty principles. But the purpose is not to be- 
little his subject. It is rather to inspire us. 
The process need not be, as might seem, disillu- 
sioning. Mr. Bradford's method is that of thor- 
ough sanity; yet he finds Lee "a human being 
as lovable as any that ever lived." " I have 
loved him," he declares, " and I may say that his 
influence upon my own life, though I came to 
him late, has been as deep and as inspiring as 
any I have ever known." 

Mr. Bradford's chapter on " The Great De- 
cision " shows us that Lee's actions were guided 
" strictly and loftily by conscience." The se- 
verest test came at the outbreak of hostilities. 
Then, as always, Lee excluded personal con- 
siderations ; but he was not satisfied with either 
party. " While I wish to do what is right," 
he wrote, " I am unwilling to do what is wrong 
at the bidding of the South or of the North." 
He felt that the destruction of the old balance 
between local and central authority would " be 
an end to Republican government in this coun- 
try "; on the other hand, he considered slavery 
" a moral and political evil " an evil which a 
decision for the South would force him to up- 
hold. "It is precisely this network of moral 
conditions," affirms Mr. Bradford, "that makes 
his heroic struggle so pathetic, so appealing, so 
irresistibly human. . . . Lee is one of the most 
striking, one of the noblest tragic figures the 
world ever produced." The most perfect com- 
ment on his life is his own statement that to do 
our duty is " all the pleasure, all the comfort, 
all the glory we can enjoy in this world." 

The chapters on Lee's relations with Davis, 
with the Confederate government, with his army, 
and with Jackson, are absorbing. Of these, the 
first two show his fine modesty and courtesy ; 
they also show his patience under trying diffi- 
culties that lead Mr. Bradford to write, " He 
was never free." The third explains his extra- 
ordinary hold upon his men through the confi- 
dence he inspired, his personal magnetism, his 



162

own love for his soldiers, and his recognition of 
the fact that he was leading an army of Ameri- 
can freemen. The fourth shows his wisdom in 
dealing with the most inflexible personalities. 
Nothing is more characteristic of him than the 
suggestion through which he reconciled differ- 
ences between Jackson and A. P. Hill: "He 
who has been the most aggrieved can be the 
most magnanimous and make the first overture 
of peace." 

The chapter on " Lee in Battle " reveals to 
us again that nice balance of Lee's gifts which 
accounts for Alexander's dictum " Probably no 
man ever commanded an army and at the same 
time so entirely commanded himself." The 
treatment of " Lee as a General " shows the 
enormous difficulties with which he had to con- 
tend, and finds four outstanding military quali- 
ties : organizing power, boldness, rapidity and 
perhaps energy of action, and a knowledge of 
human nature. The last quality enabled him 
to deal effectively with subordinate and foeman. 
Mr. Bradford thinks it the chief of his military 
merits, and hence believes Colonel Henderson's 
words are the most satisfying eulogy : " He 
was the clearest-sighted soldier in America." 

In " Lee's Social and Domestic Life " we see 
his dignity, not stiff and pompous, but natural, 
and softened by the inborn deference of the true 
democrat. He had charm and thoroughgoing 
kindliness ; his inherent moderation bordered a 
little on reserve. In " Lee's Spiritual Life " we 
learn that the bent of his character was " abso- 
lutely moral and practical." He had passions 
and sensibilities, but he kept them under con- 
trol. Perhaps he was a little too precise, a little 
too scrupulous ; yet we like to think of him as 
worrying a little after Gettysburg because he 
could not lay his hands upon officials to whom 
he might pay his taxes. He had no desire for 
rank or honors, no jealousy, no impatience un- 
der criticism, no wish to justify himself at the 
expense of others even when those others were 
at fault. His religion was "a pure and vivify- 
ing light "; it was compact of love. God was 
the cardinal fact of his life. 

" Lee before the War " is the only chapter 
which is largely narrative. It further traces 
early influences and the growth of high motives 
which were to govern him so thoroughly when 
his role became conspicuous. " Lee after the 
War " presents a period as instructive and in- 
spiring as any in his life. Whatever he did 
was sure, as Grant asserted, to have tremendous 
influence in the South. What, then, shall we 
say of his restraint, of his hopefulness, of the 



fact that, "so far as his limited opportunities 
will allow us to judge, he was a thinker in edu- 
cation as he was a thinker in war "'.' 1 1 is pro- 
gramme was one of constructive labor: "Tell 
them they must all set to work, and if they can- 
not do what they prefer, do what they can." 

A summary so meagre as has here been given 
is likely to mislead. It is earnestly recommended 
that every good citizen, every student of worthy 
personality, read for himself Captain Lee's 
" Recollections and Letters " of his father, Mr. 
Page's absorbing biography, and Mr. Bradford's 
study of Lee's inmost character. The last must 
be considered an altogether indispensable book. 
Its discriminating analysis is supported by a 
wealth of humanized evidence and vital illustra- 
tion, and it gives a superb and convincing por- 
trayal of the actual soul of Lee. One wonders 
as he reads it whether the resurrection of human 
character is not almost the equal of great crea- 
tive writing especially when the character 
resurrected is one so noble as is here portrayed.

THE LATEST EDITION OF THACKERAY.* 

There have already been at least six note- 
worthy editions of Thackeray's complete work-. 
beginning with the " Library Edition " of 
1867-9, and ending with the " Biographical 
Edition" of 1898-9 two editions for each 
decade from 1869 to 1899, with innumerable 
cheaper reprints of either the whole or a part of 
the great novelist's writings. To these numer- 
ous editions is now added another, the " Cen- 
tenary Edition de Luxe," enriched with notes 
of both biographical and bibliographical inter- 
est from the competent pen of Mr. Lewis Mel- 
ville, and not only reproducing the original 
Thackeray illustrations and some others by 
artists of his time, but also presenting a new 
series of drawings, some five hundred in num- 
ber, by Mr. Harry Furniss. The volumes are 
substantial octavos, attractively bound in blue 
and gilt, and sufficiently capacious to contain 
even the longest of the novels within the covers 
of a single book each. The "Vanity Fair," for 
example, runs to seven hundred and forty-six 
pages, with Thackeray's drawings in the text 
and Mr. Furniss's in full-page plates. 

Worthy of more than brief mention is the

" Artist's Preface " with which each volume 
is provided, and wherein the latest illustrator 
of Thackeray takes the reader into his confi- 
dence and points out some of the peculiar diffi- 
culties confronting the pictorial interpreter of 
the novelist's works. In preparing illustra- 
tions for " Vanity Fair," for instance, shall the 
modern artist bring his designs into some har- 
mony with Thackeray's own and clothe his 
characters in early Victorian costume, or shall 
he risk the discord of letting his historically 
correct drawings clash with the accompanying 
Victorian conceptions ? Strange enough to us 
now is Thackeray's explicit reason for prefer- 
ring contemporary costume to that of a genera- 
tion earlier, the actual period of the story. 
" When I remember the appearance of people 
in those days," he says in a footnote at the end 
of his sixth chapter, " and that an officer and 
lady were actually habited like [illustration 
inserted], I have not the heart to disfigure my 
heroes and heroines by costumes so hideous, 
and have, on the contrary, engaged a model of 
rank dressed according to the present fashion." 
As Mr. Furniss takes occasion to observe, we 
of the present day look back upon the early 
Victorian monstrosities of crinoline and other 
peculiarities of dress as exceedingly unbecoming, 
whereas the costume of the Waterloo period 
strikes the eye as unusually pleasing, and has, 
moreover, in ladies' dress at least, a certain sim- 
ilarity to fashions not unknown to the twentieth 
century. Consequently the costumes he has 
drawn are not so strange and repellent to the 
modern reader as are those of 1845, drawn by 
the author himself. 

That Thackeray was by no means the ideal 
illustrator of his own more serious works, no one 
will deny ; and this is attributed by Mr. Fur- 
niss to " the fact that he thoroughly enjoyed 
throwing off unconsidered trifles, slight carica- 
tures and fanciful suggestions for initial letters 
and tail-pieces, but that illustrating novels wor- 
ried him. He was never satisfied with his own 
or other artists' rendering of his heroines, and I 
doubt if I would have dared to illustrate him 
had I lived in his day." But that it was not 
merely his heroines who gave trouble to Thack- 
eray the draughtsman, is of course apparent 
even to a casual observer. In his very first 
illustration to " Vanity Fair," the vignette 
accompanying the ornamental initial at the be- 
ginning of the first chapter, he depicts an equi- 
page absurdly out of harmony with his written 
description of it in the opening paragraph. The 
" two fat horses " are the smallest of ponies ; 



and the " fat coachman," a small, boyish figure, 
is on the wrong side of the box. These and 
other inconsistencies touched lightly upon by 
Mr. Furniss are matters of curious interest to 
us now, rather than ground for complaint; but 
they probably add somewhat to the perplexities 
of the modern artist who wishes to make his 
own illustrations to Thackeray not too incon- 
sistent with one another and with the familiar 
designs of the novelist himself. 

As a test, and a severe one, of the artist's 
sympathetic imagination and technical skill, 
Beatrix offers difficulties enough, and the reader 
will examine with interest the depiction of her 
in her varying moods by the illustrator's pencil. 
Rightly enough Mr. Furniss holds that "the 
interest of the story to artists, and I venture to 
think to the reader as well, centres in Beatrix and 
her mother, with Esmond between the two, like 
Garrick between comedy and tragedy. Esmond 
is, after all, but the walking gentleman perhaps 
we ought to say the fighting gentleman in 
this play bearing his name. He is artistically 
the foil to the mother and daughter in whom the 
interest lies, the mother for her part the foil to 
Beatrix : so it comes to this, Beatrix dominates 
all, and one would have thought, at least I have, 
but hardly dare to suggest, that the title of the 
book should have been ' Beatrix.' " A captivat- 
ing creature Mr. Furniss makes of her, but 
frankly despairs of doing justice to the author's 
conception, and goes so far as to maintain that 
no brush or pencil can produce a satisfactory 
likeness, although, strangely enough, the sculp- 
tor might succeed in the undertaking. 

As illustrating Mr. Furniss's careful atten- 
tion to minute details in his difficult task, let us 
quote what he says in connection with Thack- 
eray's frequent raptures over the dainty feet of 
his heroines. "It is very seldom indeed." he 
affirms, "a pretty or a handsome woman has 
small feet, or even good proportions. All artists 
know that models with good figures have gen- 
erally plain frequently coarse faces. . . . 
Every haberdasher in selling hosiery demon- 
strates that the hand is the index to the foot, 
but it may not be generally known that the hand 
is a complete reflex of the whole figure. . . . 
This fact is, as I say, little known, otherwise I 
am sure Thackeray and other writers, dwelling 
upon the charms of their heroines, would have 
referred more to their perfectly shaped hands 
than to their pretty and impossible feet." But 
this is carrying us pretty far into the domain 
of realism and away from romance, which neither 
Thackeray nor his illustrator seriously intends. 



164 



I M:irch 1, 



In comparing Mr. Furniss's drawings with 
those of such famous earlier Thackeray illustra- 
tors as Doyle and Walker, hardly any modern 
reader can fail to find something in the later 
artist's conceptions that grips him with a stronger 
sense of reality than do the perhaps equally 
excellent drawings of Thackeray's own contem- 
poraries. Every illustrator of course breathes 
more or less of the spirit of his age ; and so, 
whether it be in the costume or attitude or bear- 
ing of the characters he draws, or in something 
far more intangible and indefinable " atmos- 
phere " is perhaps the word for it there cer- 
tainly is some quality in the work of an illustrator 
contemporary with the reader, that is likely to 
please him more than that of a much earlier 
workman in the same field. Hence, just as 
history and biography and romance have to be 
written over and over again for succeeding gen- 
erations, so the masterpieces of literature call 
for fresh illustration with each new half-century 
or e v n less ; or if the pictures are not actually 
drawn they are sure to be imagined by the reader 
for himself, which is not seldom the better way. 

Mr. Melville's prefatory bibliographical notes 
are always very much to the point and frequently 
packed with information of more than biblio- 
graphical interest. The account which Mr. Eyre 
Crowe, at one time Thackeray's secretary and 
amanuensis, gives of the work upon "Esmond " 
engages our willing attention. " An appeal to 
an obliging attendant," Mr. Crowe has related, 
" brought us through the now public portion of 
the library [of the British Museum] , where, I 
remember, on his touching a hidden spring in 
what seemed to be beautifully bound folios, but 
which were in reality only sham backs of these, 
a door flew open, and we were in the presence 
of Sir Anthony Panizzi. He readily granted 
permission to write in one of the secluded gal- 
leries, at a table placed in the midst of the vol- 
umes to be consulted. I sat down and wrote to 
dictation the scathing sentences about the great 
Marlborough, the denouncing of Cadogan, etc., 
etc." 

The volume of " Ballads and Verses, and 
Miscellaneous Contributions to ' Punch,' " with 
its amusing pictures by Thackeray, Leech, and 
others, has allowed Mr. Furniss the freest range 
to his fancy, and has also given Mr. Melville 
an opportunity to present a fuller collection of 
bibliographical notes than usual. The " Artist's 
Preface," too, is of unusual length and interest. 
In fact, the variety of readable matter contrib- 
uted to this edition of Thackeray by other pens 
than that of the novelist himself constitutes not 



the least of its admirable features. So much of 
matter within the compass of twenty volumes 
has of course imposed the necessity of a rather 
small print ; but it is clear and, to any but 
defective eyesight, large enough for comfort, 
even if not for the luxury implied in the pub- 
lisher's designation of the edition. At any rate, 
this centenary set of Thackeray's works worthily 
helps to make memorable the year of its appear-

NARRATIVES or THE INDIANS OF TIM: 
OLD NORTHWEST.* 



The two substantial volumes on " The Indian 
Tribes of the Upper Mississippi Valley and 
Region of the Great Lakes" will be heartily 
welcomed by all who are interested in original 
narratives dealing with the Indian tribes of the 
Old West the West traversed by Radisson, 
Hennepin, and Lahontan, and later by Jonathan 
Carver ; and it is much to be regretted that the 
scholarly translator and editor, Emma Helen 
Blair, did not live to receive the grateful ac- 
knowledgments of students and the reading 
public for having performed a difficult task with 
care and discrimination. 

It may be said that the work constitutes, in a 
general way, a history of the Indian tribes of 
the North west and the region of the Great Lakes, 
from their first contact with civilization to 
1827, although there is a gap of a century be- 
tween the French narratives and those written 
by American officials. The principal writings 
included are the first complete English trans- 
lation of Nicolas Perrot's " Me"moire sur les 
Moeurs, Coustumes et Religion des Salivates 
de VAmeYique Septentrionale "; a translation 
(the first) of that part of La Potherie's " Histoire 
de 1'Amerique Septentrionale " relating to the 
" savage peoples who are allies of New France"; 
a letter of Major Morrell Marston, U.S.A., to 
the Reverend Dr. Jedidiah Morse (November, 
1 820), concerning the Sauk and Foxes : and a 
report (January 15, 1827) on the manners and 
customs of the same tribes, sent to General

fairs, by Thomas Forsyth, United States Indian 
Agent. 

The English translation of Perrot's "Me- 
moire " is the most notable feature of the work. 
This book in English has long been a desidera- 
tum, for the French edition (Leipzig and Paris, 
1864), edited by Father Tailhan, a learned 
Jesuit, is not easily accessible to those far re- 
moved from the more important libraries, and 
is, of course, a sealed volume to those unfamiliar 
with the French language. The present trans- 
lation will make available to the general reader 
a really important contribution to our knowledge 
of the Indians of the Upper Mississippi Valley 
and lake region a contribution which has here- 
tofore been little known to those not specialists 
in the field of aboriginal history. 

Perrot, like Du Lhut, was a prince of cou- 
reurs de bois ; a man of tough fibre, brave, 
tactful, and shrewd ; a consummate master of 
Indian character, and perhaps the most success- 
ful of all the French emissaries among the West- 
ern Indians. Born in 1644, Perrot came to 
New France in a year unknown, and began life 
there in the service of the missionaries. He first 
came West in 1665, and at once saw the im- 
portance of uniting the Western tribes against 
their common enemy, the Iroquois, and making 
them allies of the French. He was frequently 
employed by the governors of New France on 
account of his great ability in managing the 
wily savage. A master of many of their dia- 
lects, and for many years a close student of their 
customs, Perrot exercised an influence over the 
Indians with whom he came in contact unsur- 
passed by that of any other Frenchman of his 
day. As a trader, he established several posts in 
the Indian country. It is not remarkable, there- 
fore, that this man, though an unskilled writer, 
produced a work at once interesting and reli- 
able, which, unfortunately, remained in man- 
uscript for more than a century and a half. 
He not only gives us an intimate account of 
the primitive Indian of the Old West, but also 
throws much light on the relations existing be- 
tween the French and the tribes coming within 
the sphere of their influence. 

Here is a fair example of Perrot's manner of 
writing (volume 1, pages 47-49) : 

" It cannot be said that the savages profess any doc- 
trine; and it is certain that they do not, so to speak, 
follow any religion. They only observe some Jewish 
customs, for they have certain feasts at which they make 
no use of a knife for cutting their cooked meat, which 
they devour with their teeth. The women have also a 
custom, when they bring their children into the world, 
of spending a month without entering the husband's 



cabin; and during all that time they cannot even eat 
there with the men, or eat food which has been pre- 
pared by men's hands. It is for this reason that the 
women cook their own food separately. 

" The savages I mean those who are not converted 
[to Christianity] recognize as principal divinities only 
the Great Hare, the sun, and the devils. They oftenest 
invoke the Great Hare, because they revere and adore 
him as the creator of the world ; they reverence the sun 
as the author of light; but if they place the devils among 
their divinities, and invoke them, it is because they are 
afraid of them, and in the invocations which they make 
to the devils they entreat them for [the means of] 
life. Those among the savages whom the French call 
' jugglers ' talk with the demon, whom they consult for 
[success in] war and hunting." 

It is altogether likely that Perrot would have 
extended his work somewhat had he been better 
provided with writing materials. He concludes 
the " Memoire " rather abruptly with an " ha- 
rangue which ought to have been made to all 
the Outaoiia Tribes, in order to bind them to 
the peace with the Renards and their allies "; 
and adds : " The scarcity of paper does not per- 
mit me to give fuller examples of this sort of 
harangue, as I would have been able to if I were 
not destitute of paper." 

La Pother ie was appointed, in 1698, " comp- 
troller-general of the marine and fortifications 
in Canada, the first incumbent of a newly cre- 
ated post." His " Histoire," long very scarce, 
and now in part published in English for the 
first time, is a work of great importance, but 
little known except to the few who are engaged 
in historical research. It is generally believed 
that the lost writings of Perrot, to which refer- 
ence is made by some of the early writers, were 
freely drawn upon by La Potherie, thus en- 
hancing rather than diminishing the value of his 
book. He also supplemented his own expe- 
riences as an official of the French government 
in the Indian country with information received 
from Joliet, the Jesuit fathers, and others. In 
making her translation, Miss Blair has used the 
fourth edition of the " Histoire " (Paris, 1753). 

La Potherie was a keen observer and at times 
a lively writer. There follows his description 
of an Indian feast (volume 1, pages 337, 338) : 

"They [the assembled tribes] decided that they would 
go with the Frenchmen [to Montreal] ; preparations for 
this were accordingly made, and a solemn feast was held ; 
and on the eve of their departure a volley of musketry 
was fired in the village. Three men sang incessantly, all 
night long, in a cabin, invoking their spirits from time 
to time. They began with the song of Michabous ; then 
they came to that of the god of lakes, rivers, and forests, 
begging the winds, the thunder, the storms, and the 
tempests to be favorable to them during the voyage. 
The next day, the crier went through the village, invit- 
ing the men to the cabin where the feast was to be pre- 
pared. They found no difficulty in going thither, each

with coal. While the people sat in this assembly, in 
the utmost quiet, twenty young men entirely naked, 
elaborately painted and wearing girdles of otter-skin, 
to which were attached the skins of crows, with their 
plumage, and gourds lifted from the fires ten great 
kettles; then the singing ceased. The first of these 
actors next sang hia war song, keeping time with it in a 
dance from one end to the other of the cabin, while all 
the savages cried in deep guttural tones, < Hay, hay ! ' 
When the musicians ended, all the others uttered a loud 
yell, in which their voices gradually died away, much as 
a loud noise disappears among the mountains. Then the 
second and third musicians repeated, in turn, the Mum- 
performance; and, in a word, nearly all the savages did 
the same, in alternation each singing hia own song, 
but no one venturing to repeat that of another, unless 
he were willing deliberately to offend the one who had 
composed the song, or unless the latter were dead (in 
order to exalt, as it were, the dead man's name by appro- 
priating his song). During this, their looks were accom- 
panied with gestures and violent movements; and some 
of them took hatcheta with which they pretended to 
strike the women and children who were watching them. 
Some took firebrands, which they tossed about every- 
where ; others filled their diahea with red-hot coals, which 
they threw at each other." 

The letter of Major Marston, who was in 
command of Fort Armstrong, now Rock Island, 
Illinois, was printed (1822) in a report made by 
Jedidiah Morse in the capacity of special govern- 
ment agent ; but the text for the present work 
has been obtained from a copy of the original in 
the well-known Draper manuscripts. Marston 
shows great familarity with the tribes of the 
Northwest Territory, and his relation could not 
well be spared from the collection. 

Forsyth's manuscript, also from the Draper 
collection, dealing with the Sauk and Fox tribes, 
has never before been printed ; and it is cause 
for wonder that the nimble Secretary of the Wis- 
consin Historical Society, Dr. Thwaites, did not 
long ago make use of it in the excellent publi- 
cations of that Society ; but it is far better that it 
should have been reserved for the present work. 
Forsyth adds to his interesting and valuable 
account of Indian customs and mode of life a 
considerable vocabulary. 

There are appendixes giving additional infor- 
mation concerning Perrot ; Indian society, char- 
acter, and religious beliefs (chiefly from the 
" Handbook of American Indians"); extracts 
from letters written to Miss Blair by mission- 
aries and others during the preparation of her 
volumes, setting forth the present condition of 
the Sioux, the Pottawatomi, and the Winnebago. 



There is an exhaustive bibliography, with critical 
and biographic notes, riv'rin<j fifty-two pages; 
and it is a pleasure to observe that the index, 
prepared by Gertrude M. Robertson, is all that 
could be desired. 

Miss Blair's preface, although brief , adequately 
introduces the work. With characteristic vigor 
she pleads for fair treatment of the Indians, in 
whom she has confidence, saying: "Let them 
be given a ' square deal ' in every way, and there 
is no doubt that in time they will prove them- 
selves worthy of it." 

The French works have been skilfully Eu- 
glished ; and Miss Blair's method of editing 
Perrot's " Me"moire," as also the other narra- 
tives, is admirable. She has been discriminating 
in the work of annotation ; the essential parts 
of Father Tailhan's notes which are often 
diffuse and not always important have been 
retained, and much new matter added. Her 
scrupulous honesty in editing is shown by punc- 
tilious acknowledgment of the contributions of 
others ; there are no uncredited borrowings. 

An excellent map giving the locations of the 
leading Indian tribes serves as the frontispiece 
to Volume I.; and there are fourteen other 
illustrations, perhaps the most interesting being 
a photographic facsimile of a precious auto- 
graph letter of Perrot, now in the possession of 
the Wisconsin Historical Society. A few typo- 
graphical errors have been found, but nothing 
that will mislead the reader. The books are 
handsomely printed and durably bound.

MORE LIETTERS OF RICHARD WAGM i:.- 

There probably never lived a man more com- 
pelled to a complete revelation of what was in 
him than Richard Wagner. There is no sort of 
self-revelation which his career does not manifest. 
He stormed through life in the fierce exhibition 
of a personality that broke over every limitation 
which the world without him or the world within 
him might set. He poured himself into his 
artistic productions, both poetic and musical, 
with surpassing ardor. He reveals himself in 
every musical drama: in times of darkness and 
defeat he is his own " Flying Dutchman," seek- 
ing eagerly for help and guidance ; in times of 
light and triumph he is his own Walter, who car- 
ries off the prize at the contest of the " Master- 
singers in Nuremberg." All his doubts, his

anticipations, his illuminative insights, are dis- 
closed in his dramas, and in the music which 
repeats their substance, scene for scene, char- 
acter for character. 

There came to him the inexorable demand 
to understand himself, to measure his work, to 
transform the existing state of the great art to 
which he found his life must be devoted. His 
views of music were evidently not those of his 
contemporaries ; there had been forerunners 
great and sincere men, indeed ; but the full ex- 
pression of the advance was a task which called 
on him for its sure and adequate consummation. 
So once more he sends forth his writings in 
prose, in which he reveals himself as the re- 
former in his art, the austere critic of the lower 
ideals which dominated his compeers, a voice cry- 
ing out in the wilderness, a message mingled of 
many and in some ways incongruous elements. 

The restless spirit was not satisfied with lit- 
erature and music ; nor could the individual 
activities of home and friendship bound the 
eagerness of self-realization. The time was out 
of joint, and he was chosen to set it right. If 
the means to be used were revolutionary, if 
peaceful governments were to be assailed, there 
surely would be more glory in the warfare, and 
the courage of the man should not fail to meet 
any test. So he becomes an exile from his 
country and has another grim disappointment 
added to those which had already taxed his 
endurance. 

In addition to all these activities, any one of 
which would have filled up the measure of an 
ordinary life, he was a voluminous letter-writer. 
It was inevitable that he should come in contact 
with leading minds in all departments of thought 
and action. There are now extant and published 
these letters to every sort of person, from kings 
to the simple toiler for his daily bread. He was 
possessed by the insatiable need of self-expres- 
sion. He could not hold anything secret. His 
friends and his family must share with him his 
never-ending projects and slow-coming triumphs. 
So we get the effusions to Uhlig and Fischer and 
Heine, his elaborate correspondence with Liszt, 
the kindred spirit who understood him and gave 
him aid and sympathy when he needed them 
most, his constant expressions of himself to his 
first wife Minna, his more elevated epistolary 
discussions of art and philosophy with those 
who dwelt in the same intellectual regions with 
himself; and now we have the familiar and in- 
timate exchange of opinion and anticipation with 
his mother, with brothers and sisters, and with 
other relatives. To crown all, there is the 



Autobiography as if he were compelled, like 
Socrates, by some divinity to make a further 
revelation to mankind, and put himself and his 
great work justly before posterity, so willing to 
accept him at the highest reach which his appre- 
ciators could formulate. 

The family was a large one. The mother was 
twice married, and there were children by both 
unions. They were a talented company. The 
theatre exercised upon them a controlling fasci- 
nation, and several of them were either singers 
or actresses of considerable distinction. Some 
of the sisters made fortunate marriages, giving 
the perturbed family prospects a favorable turn. 
Two of the sisters married into the Brockhaus 
family, well-known in connection with the popu- 
lar and useful JZbnversations-Lexicon. The 
half-sister (the youngest child) married Edward 
Avenarius, chief of the Paris branch of the 
Brockhaus business. She was devotedly at- 
tached to her famous brother, and the preserva- 
tion of many of the letters is due to her filial 
piety. There were children of the children upon 
whom the master seems to have looked with much 
affection, especially as his first marriage was 
destitute of offspring, a source of great grief to 
him in the dark hours of toil unrequited, and 
then showing no evidences that it would ever be 
requited. They were all held in genuinely close 
and happy relations ; and for one brother, Julius, 
who appeared incapable of winning even a small 
meed of success in life, they made provision, and 
Richard sent him money when his own circum- 
stances were so straitened that he was calling for 
help from all available sources. 

Mr. Ashton Ellis, to whom we are again in- 
debted for the excellent and characteristic trans- 
lation of these Wagner letters, makes the fol- 
lowing observations on the new collection : 

"For my own part, as between the three works just 
named [the Autobiography, the letters to the first wife 
Minna, the Family Letters here under review] in the 
matter of self-portraiture I should give decided prefer- 
ence and should have even before seeing any of them 
to the one which displays to us the author in the most 
levelling of all human relations, that of the member of a 
large family conclave, and youngest but one of a numer- 
ous middle-class brood. Here no possible suspicion of 
attitudinizing can arise in the mind of the most inveter- 
ate carper; if I may be allowed to appeal to personal ex- 
perience of a similar quiverful, elder brothers and sisters 
knock all that sort of thing out of their juniors mighty 
soon. And so we get a picture of the naked human 
spirit in the driest and most neutral of lights, even the 
letters addressed to a younger generation, those to two 
or three adoring nieces, being sobered by the certainty 
that they will be shown to the girls' parents. Yet what 
letters they are, the majority of those to his nieces ! Take

to which I may cite that to his brother-in-law Edward of 
almost ten years earlier: ' I know no first or last midst 
those my heart belongs to ; I ' ve only one heart, and who- 
ever dwells there is its tenant from bottom to top.' " 

The first letter has for date and address the 
3d of March, 1832, Leipsic ; it is written to his 
sister Ottilie ; here is an extract : 

"For you must know that for over the past half year I 
have been the pupil of our Cantor Weinlig, whom one may 
rightly call the greatest contrapuntist now alive ; added to 
which he is such an excellent man that I 'm fond of him 
aa of a father. . . . Last Christmas an overture of mine 
was performed at the theatre, and actually one at the 
Grand Concert (Gewandhaus) last week; and I would 
have you know this latter is no trifle." 

The last letter has for date and address the 
27th of October, 1874, Bayreuth ; it is written 
to his widowed sister, Clara Wolfram; an ex- 
tract follows : 

How strange, dear Clare ! Only yesterday I was 
thinking of yourself most vividly, and made up my mind 
to invite you to visit us here next summer and stay as 
long as you liked in our at last completed house. You 
were to bring your Roschen with you; it was all settled, 
and I was recalling so many chapters in my life which 
you had helped go through, and thinking how you really 
are my greatest intimate of all my brothers and sisters. 
My childhood, too, of which wife so often wants to hear, 
you alone could have distinct remembrance of. So I 
was rejoicing in the thought of writing you soon and 
behold ! there comes this sable message. Good 
Wolfram ! how glad I am I saw him once again last 
year, after so long an interval! . . . And now I ask 
myself if you ought n't, perhaps, to come to us this very 
autumn so lovely here now. . . . Then we'll have 
many a long talk and that's often a wonderful help." 

The interval spans the mighty and successful 
career ; the letters between are filled with hopes 
and fears, aspirations and exultations. The 
record is of remarkable interest ; the man is 
seen again from many points of view ; his utter- 
ance is as usual vehement, picturesque, and 
individual. 

Mr. Ellis, the translator, is completing the 
great work to which he has given so much of his 
Hfe. He is, with Herr Glasenapp, the accepted 
chronicler of Wagner. Such work as his can- 
not be overestimated ; indeed, to make an ade- 
quate statement of its value and importance 
forces one to speak in superlatives that would 
sound as vain exaggerations. The present volume 
is, like its predecessors, filled with understand- 
ing of the life with which it deals, and repro- 
duces the characteristics of the original with 



skill and effectiveness.

Few oral deliverances rank alx>ve the me- 
diocre as literature. At best the speeches of 
one orator, dealing with issues once alive but 
long since dead and buried, can but serve as 
models for later orators treating the themes of a 
newer day. If ever a speaker truly perpetuates 
himself in print, it is because the fortunate occa- 
sion and the great man have cooperated to ele- 
vate the local and transitory into tin- universal 
and lasting ; but such men and such occasions 
are in conjunction only once in an age. Burke 's 
orations will live; it is to be doubted whether 
those of Webster will survive, and only the 
choicest of Lincoln's speeches have become a por- 
tion of American literature. The "American 
Addresses" of former ambassador Joseph 11. 
Choate do not belong in this small class of ora- 
tions that are literature, but they are excellent 
specimens of modern eloquence, flowing and 
yet chaste in diction, restrained and thoughtful, 
rising frequently to elevated levels of idea and 
emotion, and revealing always a personality of 
rare charm and magnanimity. 

Indeed, the volume is a substantial and in- 
teresting contribution to recent prose. The dis- 
tinguished name of the orator from whose 

D 

addresses these selections have been made by 
himself would bespeak for the book a wider in- 
terest than is usually elicited by oral discourses 
put into cold print, and this interest is abun- 
dantly justified by the range and quality of the 
addresses. They are the select speeches of a life- 
time, a sort of record of a life enviable in rich 
and abundant experience. The earliest address 
was delivered at the opening of the famous Sani- 
tary Fair in New York in 1864 ; the latest, dated 
1910, was spoken, by a strange coincidence, at 
the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the 
founding of the first training school for nurses 
in the same city. When the first address was 
made, Mr. Choate had been practising his pro- 
fession but nine years; at the time of the last. 
forty-six years afterwards, he had long worn 
almost all the coveted laurels of a great lawyer, 
and had represented his country for six years at 
the Court of St. James. The earlier speeches 
are original documents throwing inti-rr-t in- side- 
lights on critical passages in the history of New 
York City or of the nation ; some of the later 
are reminiscences of a past as foreign to the 
present generation as is our Colonial epoch.

England Society in 1855, when Dr. Holmes was 
the shining figure present, and when the city of 
New York was all below Forty-second Street and 
numbered 500,000 souls. Still other speeches 
deal with questions of the present. 

The biographic and memorial addresses are a 
picture gallery of notable American leaders, 
Rufus Choate, the great Massachusetts orator, 
" the flashing glance of whose dark eye, and 
the light of whose bewitching smile," faded out 
together with the last " tones of his matchless 
voice " fifty-three years ago ; Admiral Farragut, 
" whose name will ever stir like a trumpet the 
hearts of his grateful countrymen "; " the great 
and dear name of Phillips Brooks," in whom 
were manifested " all the greatest and best 
qualities of Puritanism, purged of its dross, its 
follies, and its sins "; Dr. Storrs, whom all 
Brooklyn assembled to honor at his jubilee in 
1896 as its leading citizen ; James Coolidge 
Carter, for years the foremost lawyer of America ; 
Carl Schurz, hero in two wars waged for free- 
dom. Other heroic and gracious personalities 
also receive tribute of fitting praise, and the last 
address eulogizes the life and work of Florence 
Nightingale. 

In thought, eloquence of diction, and abund- 
ance of wit and humor the volume shows a 
steady progress from the earlier to the latest 
addresses. However, the born diplomat in 
the most honorable sense is the same from 
first to last. His discerning humor and skilful 
language saved the day, for instance, when the 
unpopular General Butler, governor of Massa- 
chusetts, came to the Harvard Commencement 
of 1883 prepared to express his resentment of the 
indignity done him by the purposeful absence 
of the president of the alumni association, but 
after the introduction by Mr. Choate substi- 
tuted a different and very agreeable speech. 
Many of the briefer addresses, indeed, are 
models of good sense, fine considerateness, and 
delightful wit. 

Certain of the memorial orations on Carl 
Schurz, for instance, and Phillips Brooks are 
so suffused with genuine conviction and strong 
feeling as to stir the heart even in their printed 
form. Indeed, it is the sincerity and depth of 
the speaker's convictions as to morals, character, 
and patriotism that give greatest value to the 
book. The frequently reiterated emphasis upon 
the fundamental importance of the radical vir- 
tues as the ultimate source of achievement and 
success makes the book a timely antidote to 
much that passes to-day for sound wisdom and 
trustworthy teaching. " But last and more than 



all," says the distinguished lawyer, speaking 
in 1898 before the Chicago Bar Association, 
"what Mr. Emerson said of character is far 
more true in our profession than anywhere else, 
that character is a far higher power than intel- 
lect, and character and conscience in the long 
run are sure to come out ahead." The rising 
generation will profit in essentials if it will take 
to heart similar wholesome and eloquent words 
of sound wisdom contained in almost every ad- 
dress in this volume.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE MEDIAEVAL, MIND.* 



That the mediaeval mind was dominated by 
two great influences that of classical an- 
tiquity, or the antique culture, and that of 
patristic theology is the main theme of Mr. 
Taylor's great interpretative history of mediae- 
val culture. The cultural historical manifes- 
tation of the two-fold dominance referred to 
is also two-fold ; namely, intellectual and 
emotional, the thought and the feeling of the 
age. The aim constantly before the author 
throughout these two large octavos is " to follow 
through the Middle Ages the development of 
intellectual energy and the growth of emotion." 

The organization and treatment of the im- 
mense mass of material illustrative of the char- 
acter and tendencies of mediaeval culture show 
a remarkable combination of scholarly objec- 
tivity with subjectivity of a high order. This, 
however, was only to be expected from the au- 
thor of " Ancient Ideals " and " The Classical 
Heritage of the Middle Ages." Mr. Taylor 
holds that the function of the historian is not 
merely to delve into the minutiae of the past. 
He must, at his peril, judge as well as narrate. 

" He cannot state the facts and sit aloof, impartial 
between good and ill, between success and failure, 
progress and retrogression, the soul's health and love- 
liness and spiritual foulness and disease. He must love 
and hate, and at his peril love aright and hate what 
is truly hateful. And although his sympathies quiver 
to understand and feel as the man and woman before 
him, his sympathies must be controlled by wisdom." 

So in regard to the Middle Ages, " we have to 
sympathize with their best, and understand their 
lives out of their lives and the conditions in 
which they were passed." This is not an easy 
task, and it calls for an extraordinary knowledge 
and sympathy on the part of moderns. We are

so much nearer akin to the cultural ideas and 
ideals of Greece and Rome than to those of 
mediaeval Empire and Papacy that much of the 
finest and best in mediaeval ascetic and chivalric 
thought and emotion is apt to escape us through 
lack of understanding of fundamental socio- 
psychic traits. A careful reading of Mr. 
Taylor's two volumes cannot fail to put the 
sympathetic student on an appreciative and 
understanding basis with regard to what was 
best and most characteristic in mediaeval cul- 
ture. The work is not merely informing in 
its wealth of illustration and citation, it is an 
" Open Sesame " to a thorough understanding 
of the forces and influences producing and de- 
veloping the mediaeval mind. 

In working out his thesis of dual influences 
and dual manifestations, Mr. Taylor first de- 
scribes the groundwork of mediaeval thought 
and emotion. He shows how the west was 
Latinized, and how Greek philosophy was 
clearly the antecedent of the patristic theolog- 
ical apprehension of fact. That this apprehen- 
sion was warped and narrowed by the growth 
of doctrines and dogmas of salvation, is shown 
in an interesting chapter on the " Intellectual 
Interests of the Latin Fathers," who, however, 
in spite of their " intellectual obliquities " 
developed " Catholic Christianity consisting in 
the union of two complements, ecclesiastical 
organization and the complete and consistent 
organism of doctrine," which in their union 
" were to prove unequalled in history for 
coherence and efficiency." Next we have a 
description and interpretation of the " Latin 
Transmitters of Antique and Patristic Thought," 
such as the great transitional scholar Boethius, 
whom Mr. Taylor rather daringly characterizes 
as " a professing Christian," the longeval Cas- 
siodorus with his Christian utilitarian view 
of knowledge," the almost mediaeval Gregory 
the Great in whom cultural decadence and 
barbarism meet and join, and, as a final type, 
Isidore, the princely scholar-bishop of Seville, 
the encyclopaedist of the Middle Ages whose 
"Etymologise," in twenty books, contains "a 
conglomerate of knowledge, secular and sacred, 
exactly suited to the coming centuries." The- 
ology, grammar, and rhetoric were dominant 
over reason and science by the middle of the 
seventh century. 

In the remainder of the section devoted to 
the groundwork, Mr. Taylor describes the na- 
ture and effects of the barbaric disruption of the 
empire : how the Celtic people of Gaul and Ire- 
land contributed a peculiar emotional romantic 



strain, how Teuton qualities came from Anglo- 
Saxon, German, and Norseman, and how Chris- 
tianity and antique knowledge were brought by 
Irish and Roman monks to the pagan peoples 
of the north. All this is well and skilfully told, 
and the function of the Teutons in mediaeval 
evolution is shown to have been to accept 
Christianity and learn something of the pagan 
antique, and then to react upon what they had 
received and change it to their natures." 

The next section of the work takes up in detail 
the intellectual forces and figures of the early 
Middle Ages. The Carolingian period shows 
the first stage in the appropriation of the patriot i- 
and antique, while the beginnings of European 
nationalism in the eleventh century are recog- 
nized by separate chapters on the Latin cul- 
tural thought of Italy, France, Germany, and 
England. In closing this section, attention is 
drawn to the growth of mediaeval emotion in 
connection with Latin Christianity. 

The struggle to maintain the ideal and the 
failure of realization, thus producing the actual, 
in connection with both the saints and ordinary 
society, furnishes the basic motive for Books III. 
and IV. Monastic reforms, eremitism, the 
spiritual love of St. Bernard and St. Francis, 
and the mystic visions of ascetic women, illus- 
trate the saintly ideal ; while the " spotted 
actuality " of religious life is shown by the tes- 
timony of mediaeval invective and satire, by the 
astounding revelations of Archbishop Rigaud's 
Register, and other evidences of failure to rise to 
the ideal. One of Mr. Taylor's greatest descrip- 
tive triumphs is the delightful chapter dealing 
with the thirteenth-century world of the honest 
garrulous Franciscan friar Salimbene. Here 
the actual is seen in true perspective through 
the " uncloistered eye " of the naive ecclesiastic. 
In regard to the ideal and actual in society, we 
have feudalism and knighthood described and 
contrasted with romantic chivalry, courtly love, 
and mystical aspirations ; while the mediaeval 
woman is shown us in the person of Heloise, 
and the critic of society in Walther von der 
Vogelweide, type of German nationalism and of 
Teutonic opposition to what was Roman. 

The topic of Mediaeval Symbolism is inter- 
estingly discussed in three chapters of Book V., 
dealing with scriptural allegories, the interpre- 
tation of the visible world, as given by the inven- 
tive Hugo of St. Victor, and the symbolism of 
the cathedral, the mass, and the hymn or relig- 
ious poem. A wealth of illustration is given to 
round out a scholarly general treatment of a 
difficult subject.

THE DIAL

The next section is devoted to " Latinity and 
Law," and shows the origin and development of 
Latin culture along somewhat secular lines of 
prose and verse which approach the popular and 
vernacular. An additional chapter dealing with 
the mediaeval appropriation of the Roman Law 
hardly does justice to the dynamic significance 
of the great legal revival of the twelfth and 
thirteenth centuries. 

The task of tracing the development of the 
mediaeval mind and interpreting its produc- 
tions is brought to a most successful close in 
Book VII., dealing with the " Ultimate Intel- 
lectual Interests of the Twelfth and Thirteenth 
Centuries." Scholasticism is made clear in its 
spirit, scope, and method, from its beginnings 
to its triumph in Thomas Aquinas. The great 
rationalist Roger Bacon is skilfully depicted, and 
the keen-minded controversialists Duns Scotus 
and Occam are given a chapter. Finally, in 
Dante, in whom " the elements of mediaeval 
growth combine," Mr. Taylor finds his type for 
the mediaeval synthesis. 

"When the contents of patristic Christianity and 
the surviving antique culture had been conceived anew, 
and had been felt as well, and novel forms of senti- 
ment evolved, at last comes Dante to possess the whole, 
to think it, feel it, visualize its sum, and make of it a 
poem." 

It is easier to appreciate than to criticize 
such a work as Mr. Taylor's on " The Mediaeval 
Mind." The erudition, scholarship, and under- 
standing of developmental forces, command 
respect and admiration. Possibly the author 
has brought to his task of interpretation too 
set ideas of exact influences and channels of 
development. There will certainly be some who 
will feel that the vernacular aspects of mediaeval 
culture have been slighted for the sake of the 
Latin. Others will criticize the absence of a 
certain institutional sense in relation to culture 
and civilization ; and still others will feel that 
there is too much of the biographical and 
personal in the work. No writer can please 
everyone, but it may be safely prophesied that 
Mr. Taylor will lead many into new cultural 
paths. His work should be an incentive to 
more vital study of the past, and should serve 
to draw attention to the field of cultural history 
so much neglected in our American universities. 
Special courses in the history of European 
culture are now given at Columbia, Wisconsin, 
Illinois, Missouri, and possibly at one or two 
other universities. They should be given in 
all the larger institutions.

None the less, by reason of the peculiar problems 
that have been created by the coming of the Greeks 
among us, not to mention the romantic interest 
attaching always to the fortunes of the modern 
Hellenes, the subject of the Greeks in America is 
one which is distinctly worthy of careful attention. 
It is agreeable to record that in Dr. Henry Pratt 
Fairchild's " Greek Immigration to the United 
States " (Yale University Press) are brought 
together in attractive form the results of a thor- 
oughly commendable study of this subject. In the 
writing of his book Dr. Fairchild has had the ad- 
vantage not merely of the most approved training 
in anthropology and social science, but also of first- 
hand knowledge of the Greek people, including their 
language, in both their old and their new home. If 
the number of the Greeks is small, the impressions 
which they yield are the more definite and clear- 
cut, and it has been possible for Dr. Fairchild to 
compass his subject and to present a many-sided 
view of it in a measure which one might hardly 
hope to attain in dealing with the Italians, the 
Hungarians, the Jews, or any one of our larger 
foreign groups. In the first portion of his volume 
the author describes the conditions, causes, and 
sources of Greek emigration ; in the second, the 
Greeks as they are in their American homes ; and 
in the third, the effects of immigration upon the 
home land, upon the United States, and upon the 
immigrants themselves. The causes of Greek emi- 
gration are shown to be almost exclusively economic, 
arising fundamentally from the lack of a diversifi- 
cation of industry, and more immediately from the 
agricultural depression of recent years, combined 
with the cutting off of opportunity for employment 
in the adjacent countries of Roumania and Bulgaria. 
Money-making, it is pointed out, is with the modern 
Greek a ruling passion. It is for the purpose of 
making money that the Athenian or Tripolitan 
comes to America, and it is from the same consider- 
ation that, at the sacrifice generally of more pleasant 
living conditions, of the society of his kind, and 
often even of health, he remains. The effects of an 
American residence upon the average Greek the 
author feels generally to be dubious. The most 
unfavorable aspects of Greek life in the United 
States, it is pointed out, arise from the insignificant 
proportion of women (in 1910 only six per cent) 
among the immigrant arrivals, effectually precluding 
the benefits of family ties. Upon Greece itself the 
effects of emigration to America are declared to be 
serious in the extreme. " It is no exaggeration to 
say that if emigration keeps on at its present rate of

increase, as it promises to do, within twenty years 
Greece will be completely drained of its natural 
working force, and the population will consist of a 
few old men and a host of old women and middle- 
aged spinsters." The author's conclusion would 
seem to he that while it would be better all around 
for the Greek to remain in Greece, there is slender 
likelihood of his doing so. 

incident* in With a lack of literary thrift which 
the making of he himself acknowledges, Mr. Joseph 
a tailor-author. Conrad has packed into his small 
autobiographical volume, " A Personal Record " 
(Harper), enough incident and adventure to form 
the ground-work of several novels. In an agreeably 
hap- hazard fashion he recalls some of the more sig- 
nificant events in his various wanderings on sea and 
land, and gives us glimpses meanwhile of his mental 
growth and of his gradual and rather late develop- 
ment as an author. Not until he was thirty-six years 
old did this vagrant son of unhappy Poland write a 
line for publication, and even then his first book, 
" Almayer's Folly," was four years in getting itself 
put upon paper. Surely there has been in his case 
no precipitate rushing into print under the spur of 
thirst for fame. A pleasing picture of the boy Joseph, 
who learned to read so early that he never could 
recall the process of learning, is given in his account 
of his introduction, at the age of eight, to English 
literature. "Two Gentlemen of Verona," in a manu- 
script translation by his father, a scholar and a 
writer, ushered him into a new world where he seems 
soon to have made himself at home. Turning the 
rich pages of Mr. Conrad's book, in which he makes 
a praiseworthy attempt to picture himself honestly 
and accurately to the reader's view, one might feel 
tempted to note a rather curious inconsistency of 
statement. In his preface he modestly disclaims 
anything like inspiration, any compelling force that 
has made him write romances of the sea, adding that 
he has " a positive horror of losing even for one mov- 
ing moment that full possession of myself which is 
the first condition of good service." But in his open- 
ing chapter he writes : " I dare say I am compelled 
unconsciously compelled now to write volume 
after volume, as in past years I was compelled to go 
to sea voyage after voyage. Leaves must follow upon 
one another as leagues used to follow in the days 
gone by, on and on to the appointed end, which, 
being Truth itself, is One one for all men and for 
all occupations." So little does introspection help a 
man really to know himself. One oddity of idiom 
is likely to puzzle the reader of this anglicized Polish 
author : he has an unaccountable fondness for a par- 
ticipial construction where the sense might better 
require an infinitive. For example : " I failed in 
being the second white man on record drowned at 
that interesting spot"; and again, - Would it bore 
you very much reading a MS. in a handwriting like 
mine?" But the book is too interesting as a human 
document, partly by reason of its very blemishes, to 
make those blemishes count against it very heavily.

We live in a difficult world, and one 

i % 11 

which, subdue ita processes to our 
of Mvtticiim. ngeg ag we niay, still sets us insoluble 
problems which refuse to be banished even \\li.-n 
their insolubility is most apparent. It is no wonder 
that we are always seeking short-cuts, away from 
the jungle of the senses and the intellect, into the 
pure and calm reality which we imagine must be 
somewhere and somehow available. Mysticism i- 
the philosophy of the short-cut to reality. Men and 
women in all ages have told of a realm of peace, entry 
into which could only be obtained by the use of a 
kind of contemplative technique which had the effect 
of freeing one from one's self and attaching one's 
soul to God. In " Mysticism : A Study in the Nature 
and Development of Man's Spiritual Consciousness" 
(Button), Miss Evelyn Underbill, already known on 
both sides of the Atlantic as a novelist, has written 
a remarkably detailed and documented study of tin- 
activity or rather passivity of the human spirit. 
Herself a thorough believer in mysticism, she has 
traced reverently and sympathetically, and yet with 
independent comment and explanation, the expe- 
riences of the soul which all the mystics agree in 
reporting as the fruits of their heavenly quests. As 
a contribution to religious psychology made from an 
empirical standpoint, the book cannot be too highly 
commended. Miss Underbill reports widely, fairly, 
and intelligently, and her bibliographies hint at a 
vast amount of research work. As to mysticism's 
validity, and Miss Underbill's philosophical defence 
of it, one cannot speak in the same strain. By its 
own implications mysticism is aristocratic fitted 
neither to the endowment nor the vocation of the 
average man, and it is reactionary by the very fact 
that it is a contemplative appropriation of the static 
and the established (if indeed it is not purely sub- 
jective), and not the active creation of any new value. 
This latter criticism of mysticism makes it all the 
more curious that Miss Underbill should appeal to 
M. Henri Bergson, the great activistic philosopher, 
for a confirmation of the mystic philosophy. His 
" vital urge " as a life principle is very far from the 
" Absolute " of which Miss Underbill habitually 
speaks. Her use of the philosophy of the German 
idealist, Eucken, in this connection, is more logical; 
but Encken, it must be remembered, is a moralist as 
well as a mystic, and it is only fair to say that, 
with most modern philosophers, he lays more and 
in fact more fundamental stress upon activism, the 
creation of new values, than he does upon mere 
contemplation, however emotionally satisfying the 
latter may be. _

which characterized the same author's "Origin and 
Growth of the English Constitution." A connection 
between the two works is established in a chapter

THE DIAL 



173 



in the later publication on " The Evolution of the 
Typical American State," in which Dr. Taylor gives 
a summary of the constitutional development of En- 
gland as far as it bears on the origin of American 
legal and political institutions. Succeeding chapters 
treat of the federal state; the Constitutional Con- 
vention of 1787 ; the first twelve amendments ; 
African slavery in its legal aspects ; constitutional 
growth from the time of John Marshall to the Civil 
War ; the Civil War amendments ; the constitutional 
questions arising from the territorial acquisitions of 
the United States ; the problems of interstate com- 
merce ; and, finally, " The Outcome of Our Growth." 
Although open to criticism in some details, these 
chapters contain much that is interesting and valu- 
able. Unfortunately, in the earlier section of the 
book, and at intervals in the latter part, Dr. Taylor 
has attempted to combine with a general account of 
the constitutional history of the United States a very 
special task which properly belongs to a separate 
work. The nature of this task is indicated by Dr. 
Taylor in the sub-title to his work, which describes 
it as " an historical treatise in which the document- 
ary evidence as to the making of the entirely new 
plan of federal government embodied in the existing 
Constitution of the United States is, for the first 
time, set forth as a complete and consistent whole." 
The meaning of this, the reader learns, is that 
Pelatiah Webster, through his " Dissertation on the 
Political Union and Constitution of the Thirteen 
United States," published in Philadelphia in 1783, 
was the "daring innovator," the "great architect," 
the " father of the Constitution," from whom Madi- 
son and Hamilton and Pinckney, and consequently 
the Federal Convention, derived all the essential 
features of the Constitution of the United States. 
It need hardly be said that the most careful students 
of this period of American history have not agreed 
with Dr. Taylor's estimate of the importance of this 
pamphlet of Webster's, or with the author's emphasis 
upon his " unearthing " of it. But even if the argu- 
ments of Dr. Taylor were to prevail, the inclusion 
of these in a one-volume treatise upon the develop- 
ment of our constitutional history would necessarily 
destroy the balance and proportion of the work. 
If the author were a beginner or of small reputation 
this would be, perhaps, of little consequence ; but in 
the case of one whose career has been so long and 
so distinguished it must be regretted that so much 
labor has been expended on a work which, as a 
whole, cannot be regarded as satisfactory. 

We are living in the centenary of 
A great German . & . J 

military hero. events which kept Europe in turmoil. 

Napoleon's overwhelming prestige 
was beginning to show signs of disintegration, though 
his Russian disaster apparently taught him no mod- 
eration. Austria was his football, Prussia his de- 
spised tool; and it was not till 181314 that the 
Germans "found themselves," massed their forces 
with those of Russia and England and slowly forced 
the world-conqueror back, from Leipzig to Paris, 



Elba, Waterloo, and St. Helena. In all these cam- 
paigns no man was more persistently active than 
the rugged septuagenarian Gebhard Leberecht von 
Blucher, affectionately known to his men as "Mar- 
shal Vorwarts." Very timely, then, is the appear- 
ance of a new volume in the " Heroes of the Na- 
tions " series (Putnam), dealing with Blucher, and 
written by Mr. Ernest F. Henderson. The author's 
special object is to raise Bltlcher's fame from a 
secondary to a primary rank; to show that " instead 
of being merely the man who came to Wellington's 
aid at Waterloo, he had a separate existence of his 
own and performed other great deeds in the cause 
that were equally deserving," and "to establish him 
in his rightful position as the peer of Wellington 
in all that concerns the overthrow of Napoleon." 
Against Wellington's Spanish campaigns he sets 
forth Blucher as " the one progressive inspiring ele- 
ment among the leaders of the allies from 1813 on." 
Blucher certainly shone with many heroic qualities 
in the midst of the unheroic magnates who constantly 
thwarted his fierce and aggressive spirit. Yet he 
was a fighter, not a master of strategy ; allowing 
Gneisenau to plan for him movements which he 
eagerly executed a proof, surely, of self-knowledge 
and good sense. His one overmastering passion was 
hatred of Napoleon, and he was quite free from the 
obsession of fear created in his colleagues' hearts by 
the presence or approach of the arch-enemy. At 
seventy-two, this stalwart veteran was never hap- 
pier than when leading a charge or a forlorn hope ; 
and was singularly indifferent to danger or hardship. 
It would seem that he regarded his life-work as done 
when Napoleon was safely caged in St. Helena ; 
though he lived four years longer, dying in 1819. 
As there is no English life of Blucher or any English 
translation of his German biographies, Mr. Hender- 
son's work would appear to fill a real gap. The book 
is written with considerable descriptive power, is 
amply illustrated with portraits, maps, and plans, 
and has an interesting appendix, containing extracts 
from German Volksongs by Arndt, KOrner, Ruckert, 
and others, which fired the Teutonic heart, and many 
of which chanted the praises of " the old hoary hero 
who stands forth as the one national figure of the 
Liberation wars."

difficult to see how any scholarly reference use can 
be made of books dealing with Greek antiquities

THE DIAL 



[March 1, 



" The Greek Commonwealth " (Oxford : Clarendon 
Press). It is an admirable essay, of about 450 pages, 
on the social and economic conditions in the Athens 
of the great golden fifth century B. c. Environment, 
natural influences, and inter-action of individual 
and national character are subjected to a penetrat- 
ing analysis, the results of which are set forth in 
an engaging and even fascinating manner. Mr. 
Zimmern has caught the breezy and colloquial style 
of his much-admired friend, Professor Gilbert 
Murray ; and he commends his subject to the most 
indifferent reader by a thousand modern touches, 
allusions, and comparisons with twentieth century 
conditions; as in the striking chapter on " Poverty," 
where, showing that a great race could be poverty- 
stricken and yet highly civilized, he says : 

"We forget that they were more innocent of most of 
these [material blessings and comforts] than the up-country 
Greeks of to-day, or than most Englishmen were before the 
Industrial Revolution. It is easy to think away railways 
and telegraphs and gasworks and tea and advertisements 
and bananas. But we must peel off far more than this. 
We must imagine houses without drains, beds without 
sheets or springs, rooms as cold, or as hot, as the open air, 
meals that began and ended with pudding, and cities that 
boasted neither gentry nor millionaires. We must learn 
to tell the time without watches, to cross rivers without 
bridges, and seas without a compass, to fasten our clothes 
(or rather our two pieces of cloth) with two pins instead of 
rows of buttons, to wear our shoes or sandals without stock- 
ings, to warm ourselves over a pot of ashes, to judge open- 
air plays or lawsuits on a cold winter's morning, to study 
poetry without books, geography without maps, and politics 
without newspapers. In a word, we must learn how to be 
civilized without being comfortable. Or rather we must 
learn to enjoy the society of people for whom comfort 
meant something very different from motor-cars and arm- 
chairs, who, although or because they lived plainly and 
austerely and sat at the table of life without expecting 
any dessert, saw more of the use and beauty and goodness of 
the few things which were vouchsafed them their minds, 
their bodies, and Nature outside and around them." 
The book is not all condensed epigram, as might 
perhaps be inferred from the above extract ; but the 
author has not failed to impart a piquant flavor to 
everything statistics, constitutional developments, 
and lists of magistrates ; and he holds the reader's 
attention and interest to the very end. 



William jamet * Boutroux has undertaken 

interpreted bv to interpret William James to French 
a Frenchman, students of philosophy. His study 
of the great American is at once an appreciation 
and a version of James's thought and personality. 
When brought back to the medium of the original, 
it impresses the English reader as peculiarly yet 
evasively foreign. The crisp and juicy phrases of 
James are lacking, the gait of the thought fitted to 
an alien movement, and this despite the fact that 
James had an intimate knowledge and sympathy 
with the Gallic procedure. M. Boutroux's essay 
deserves to be judged for its service to French 
readers. For them it doubtless supplies an approach 
to the main features of James's philosophy, adapted 
to their accustomed assimilation. The leading doc- 
trines are briefly presented : the persistent emphasis 
of the active principle in thought; the concreteness 



of experience; the pervasiveness of personality: 
the pragmatic criterion ; the legitimacy of the non- 
intellectual forms of apprehension ; the reaction from 
traditional philosophical systems ; the vitality of 
philosophy when brought to bear upon the issues of 
life. The transformation of the thought is a matter 
of the rendering; bold pen-and-ink directness be- 
comes a water-color delicacy of stroke, that reveals 
identity of subject but feebly reflects the artist. It 
is James the philosopher rather than James the 
psychologist that has appealed to foreign students ; 
and the same preference of interest t hat brought 
him fame and recognition in France appears in the 
interpretation of his thought for the French mind. 
The discrepancy is least apparent in the chapter on 
James's pedagogy itself an un-Jamesian rubric, 
which well sets forth the intellectual maturing that 
to James was an essential variety of experience and 
of profoundest influence upon the stamp of philoso- 
phies. None the lees is it pleasant to have available 
in English a timely appreciation of one of the few 
academicians to whom has been accorded the recog- 
nition for which American institutions provide so 
inadequately. (Longmans.) 



Art, and craft, " No 8tudv of E" r pean Art in gen- 
of our Teutonic eral can be complete without taking 
into account [an] early manifesta- 
tion of the artistic spirit on the part of the race that 
has made modern Europe," that is to say, the 
Germanic or Teutonic race. These words furni>h 
ample apology for a series of lectures delivered in 
the spring of 1910, by Dr. G. Baldwin Brown, 
Watson Gordon Professor of Fine Art in the Uni- 
versity of Edinburgh, now expanded into a volume 
entitled "The Arts and Crafts of Our Teutonic Fore- 
fathers" (McClurg). The author recognizes two 
great divisions in the general history of the Arts in 
western Europe in the period between the decline of 
classical art and the establishment in the eleventh 
century of what is known as the Romanesque. The 
hitherto more neglected of these divisions has to do 
with the arts and crafts of the Teutons, a phase of 
esthetic activity differing from that of the Mediter- 
ranean region in that it is essentially decorative 
rather than representative. It is to a very small 
extent monumental, but largely applied to purposes 
of personal use and adornment, to "the apparatus 
of useful or pleasing things with which men have 
in all ages equipped their daily life." The author 
calls attention to the fact that a part of the exhibits 
in public museums with which students of archaeology 
and historic ornament are familiar, such as "Tomb 
Furniture," consists of things "originally concealed 
as treasure deposits by those who expected one day 
to recover them." These furnish the most valuable 
objects of study, because of their rarity, costliness, 
and variety. They belong to the period of the 
Teutonic migrations, beginning with the Marcoman- 
nic War in the region north of the Danube, about 
A.D. 170, and extending to the year 800, when the 
Empire of Charlemagne became technically Unman.

Professor Brown's study of this rich material is 
complete and scholarly, and is intended to exploit an 
original Northern art whose most characteristic ex- 
pression consists of zoOmorphic decoration, and the 
combination of animal motives with interlaced rib- 
bons or straps, which in its later form is called Celtic. 
He explains, however, that "originality in art does 
not necessarily depend upon invention, but on the 
extent to which the borrowed or inherited suggestion 
can be developed into some new and striking con- 
tribution to the artistic treasures of mankind." The 
book presents a new point of view in art history, 
and introduces the reader to an entirely new field 
of study. The only fault to be found with it is that 
the half-tone illustrations are too small to present 
the subjects adequately. 

imprestiont Not cat hedrals or museums or pal- 
of European aces, not ruined castles or sublime 
travel. scenery, not the places starred in 

the guide-books and conscientiously visited by the 
determined tourist, form the subject of the late Per- 
cival Pollard's " Vagabond Journeys " (Neale), but 
rather the oddities and whimsicalities of the people 
he has familiarly moved among in his lifelong roam- 
ing from country to country. The subjective ele- 
ment, the impressions of the writer, will be found 
emphasized on every page, with little or nothing of 
prosaic fact or mere objective detail. "The reader 
need not be afraid," considerately announces the 
author in his preface, " that either facts or dogmatic 
infliction of opinion will be forced upon him. Here 
are simply the impressions of one individual, a few 
random excursions with a whimsical temper." In 
this spirit he favors us with some passing impres- 
sions, curious indeed and sometimes surprising, of 
Florence, Munich, Paris, Berlin, London, and " a 
typical cure resort," with a brief glimpse of Egypt. 
Among the countless snap-shots that his pages con- 
tain, here is one of the travelling American college 
professor: "Our friend, the professor, approaches 
the voyage with all the pomp and circumstance that 
he is sure his position entitles him to. Is there a 
place in the dining-saloon more choice than another ? 
He files his claim for it, waving close to the purser's 
nose his scholarly credentials and his whiskers." 
How far the portrait is lifelike the reader is at lib- 
erty to decide for himself. Berlin Mr. Pollard finds 
to be at once " more fierce " than Boston in the 
pursuit of culture, and more determinedly dissolute 
than Paris in nocturnal amusements. His researches, 
it will be perceived, have a generous amplitude of 
range. For sprightliness and verve, and for variety 
of vivid impressions, few books of travel can be 
named in the same breath with these astonishing 
" Vagabond Journeys." 

Primitive justice T . he lawlessness of frontier mining 
in early life has never received a more vivid 

presentation at the historian's hands 
than in Mr. Nathaniel Pitt Langford's "Vigilante 
Days and Ways " (McClurg), wherein is most 



graphically depicted the painful struggle of Montana 
and Idaho, fifty years ago, out of turbulent lawless- 
ness into order and quiet. The writer was an active 
participant in this rude conflict, and what he has to 
say about the vigilance committees of the period, 
and about the desperate characters whom they were 
organized to bring to summary justice, commands 
ready attention and makes a narrative more interest- 
ing than fiction. Beginning with the notorious Henry 
Plummer and the rude state of society in Lewiston, 
Montana, where that adroit villain practised his ras- 
calities and organized his company of cut-throats and 
horse- thieves, the chronicle makes us acquainted with 
numerous other adepts in crime, such as Cherokee 
Bob and Charley Harper and Boone Helm, and leads 
us through a half hundred chapters of breathless inci- 
dent to the final establishment of that peace and 
order which the author regards as most gratifying 
evidence of the effectiveness of the punitive meth- 
ods adopted. "Equal in degree," he maintains in 
glowing language at the close of his book, " to the 
sacrifices made by the brave soldiers of the war who 
saved our Republic, were the deeds of those who 
saved Montana from rapine and slaughter. Like 
them, the graves of the dead should be crowned with 
flowers, and the pathway of the living be brightened 
with the rewards of a grateful people." No reader 
will regret that the writer yielded to the temptation 
facetiously referred to by him in this quotation from 
Cervantes : " One of the chief temptations of the 
Devil is that he can persuade a man that he can 
write a book, by which he can achieve both wealth 
and fame." The volume is well illustrated, well 
printed, and has a useful index.

solemn circumstance, have captivated the fancy of 
the anonymous writer of " Intimacies of Court and 
Society " (Dodd), and her detailed account of diplo- 
matic life, as seen and participated in for many years 
by the wife of an American diplomat, will appeal to 
those numerous readers to whose view the distance 
of European court life lends an unfailing enchant- 
ment. Also there is the amusement of trying to fol- 
low the few personal clues given by this " widow of 
an American diplomat " to her proper identification. 
Her narrative is mostly confined to the events of 
her later " unofficial days," as she calls them, when 
she felt greater freedom in ordering her ways and 
choosing from among the invitations extended to 
her by the titled friends of earlier times. Thus the 
reader is introduced to the courts and the fashionable 
society of the principal European capitals, and sees 
in a near view and under new lights a number of 
the mighty ones of the earth. By one monarch, 
however, the writer failed to feel herself overawed 
or even impressed. The Czar of Russia, as seen at 
his coronation, "produced in himself no illusion of

Mr. John Spargo's " Sidelights on Contemporary 
Socialism" (B. W. Huebsch), like the German work 
mentioned, is an argument for modernism in social-

parts, the first and last dealing with Karl Marx, and 
the other with the menace of " anti-intellectualism "

human and poetical aspects of Marx's personality, 
and urges his fellow Socialists to regard him, not 
primarily as the author of " Das Kapital," but as the 
personal leader and far-seeing tactician. He admits 
that many of the Marxian economic doctrines have 
been overthrown, and that others have been so per-

more harm than good to the movement. The chap-

mental in causing this new account of Hannah Light- 
foot to be written. Unfortunately the owner of the 
letters refuses to allow their publication or even to 
permit the biographer a second reading of them ; 
therefore it is only a vague impression of their char- 
actor and contents that can now be contributed as 
the new and first-hand element in this rehearsal of 



tlu- fair Quaker's oft-told tale. The book reveals a 
diligent study of a wide range of authorities, many 
of them but remotely pertinent to the subject in hand, 
and an active exercise of sympathetic imagination. 
But the writer acknowledges at the end : " I have 
written her story for love of her, and hope someone 
else will write her history, if I may not." Illustra- 
tions, appended notes, a bibliography, and an index 
help to make the volume completely serviceable. 

For a time at least, M. Maeterlinck 

bid fair to en 8 a & e attention more 
than any other Continental writer. 
The magazine articles continue to multiply, and the 
books are already perhaps too many. We might 
even have been spared " Maurice Maeterlinck : A 
Study " (Duffield), by Mr. Montrose J. Moses. For 
the most part it is journalistic writing : it is devoted 
to casual and somewhat trivial comment rather 
than to serious exposition and criticism. One may 
devour the book quickly it is light reading and 
suffer no indigestion; and yet one is sure to long 
afresh for critical "studies" that really indicate 
reflection and intellectual force. The chief idea that 
runs through the book is that M. Maeterlinck has 
undergone a desirable evolution and is still changing 
his point of view. This idea is elaborated by a 
survey of his poems, plays, and essays, rather than 
by a study of his life and temper. Of " The Blue 
Bird," his most conspicuous popular success, Mr. 
Moses writes sensibly : " I take it as a child's play 
with all the jumble of a child's wisdom." Elsewhere 
he makes various acute remarks, only to destroy the 
reader's confidence by misplacing French accents 
and misspelling German words. The book contains 
a useful bibliography. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



" The Great Illusion," Mr Norman Angell's remark- 
able demonstration of the futility of war, has now been 
issued by the Putnams in a third and revised edition, in 
which the author takes occasion to reply to some of ln> 
critics. 

TheEnglishWho'sWho"forl912(Macmillan),after 
making jetsam of certain tables and other superfluous 
matters found in earlier editions, is still so swollen in 
bulk that its thickness approximates to its two other 
dimensions. It now extends to 26 + 2364 + 52 pages. 

"A History of English Criticism," by Professor 
George Saintsbury, is a reprint in one volume, with cer- 
tain revisions and additions, of the English chapters of 
the author's great " History of Criticism and Literary 
Taste in Europe." Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. are the 
American publishers. 

Number twelve of volume nine of the " University of 
Illinois Bulletin " is devoted to an alphabetical enumera- 
tion of the three hundred or more sets (complete or 
partial) of library reports and bulletins collected by the 
library school of the University. This collection, be^nn 
with the establishment of the school in 1897, can boast 
of contributions from every continent of the globe and 
from gome of the islands of the sea. 



1912.] 



THE DIAL 



To the series of " English Texts " for schools, pub- 
lished by the Charles E. Merrill Co., there have been 
added Irving's " Sketch Book," edited by Dr. Charles 
A. Dawson ; the " Odyssey," in Buckley's prose transla- 
tion (eight books omitted), edited by Mr. Edwin Fail-ley; 
and the complete text of the first " Golden Treasury," 
edited by Mr. Allan Abbott. 

An " author-index " to the bibliography of " Periodi- 
cal Articles" on Religion, 1890-1899 " having been asked 
for by many persons, Mr. Ernest Cushing Richardson 
has now prepared such a work, the publication coining 
to us from. Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. The titles 
of the earlier work are redistributed in an alphabetical 
author-arrangement. The result is a bulky octavo vol- 
ume of nearly nine hundred pages. 

Professor Edward Everett Male's " Dramatists of 
To-day," a work for which THE DIAL was primarily 
responsible, has been revised up-to-date, and now ap- 
pears in a sixth edition from the press of Messrs. Henry 
Holt & Co. The seven men who have special chapters 
are Messrs. Rostand, Hauptmann, Sudermann, Pinero, 
Shaw, Phillips, and Maeterlinck. Portraits and bibli- 
ographies add much to the value of this work. 

" Things Seen in Venice," by Canon Ragg and Miss 
Laura Ragg, is a recent addition to the series of chatty 
little travel-books published by Messrs. E. P. Dut- 
tou & Co. Charmingly illustrated, with fifty clearly- 
printed half-tones which fit the text, the volume gives 
us a pleasantly familiar picture of the Queen of the Adri- 
atic; the "points of chiefest interest" include interest- 
ing chapters on " Fasts and Festivals " and " Venice on 
Foot." A good index is provided, but no maps. 

Three recent additions to the series of " Columbia 
University Studies iu English " are of considerable im- 
portance. Dr. Earl L. Bradsher writes of Mathew Carey, 
the Philadelphia editor, author, and publisher, throwing 
much light upon the literary and political history of the 
nation during its earlier years; Dr. Allan F. Westcott 
writes a study of certain "New Poems of James I. of 
England," which he edits from a hitherto unpublished 
manuscript; and Miss Mary Leland Hunt gives us a 
monograph upon the life and works of Thomas Dekker. 

" Tous les Chef s-d'(Euvres de la Litte"rature Franchise " 
is the ambitious title given to a new series of French 
reprints, of which Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons are the 
American agents. The volumes now sent us include 
" La Chanson de Roland " (in modern French), Jacques 
Amyot's "Deux Vies Paralleles" (Alexander and 
Caesar), " Philosophic," a volume of extracts from Vol- 
taire, and the first volume of the works of Rabelais. 
The print of these books is too small to be easily legible, 
but otherwise they are to be commended as a sort of 
French " Everyman's Library." 

"Readings in American History " is the title given 
to two small source-booklets, edited by Mr. Edgar W. 
Ames, and published by the Charles E. Merrill Co. 
They differ from most books of this kind by being 
made up of selections of considerable length. Thus, the 
first volume includes only four extracts: John Smith's 
" True Relation," Juet's account of the discovery of the 
Hudson, Bradford's " Plimouth Plantation," and Gov- 
ernor Hutchinson on "The Destruction of the Tea." 
In the second volume we find the Monroe Doctrine, 
Lincoln's most famous writings, Seward's Speech on 
Alaska, and the autobiography of Peter Cooper. These 
are capital little books, and may be warmly commended 
to teachers of American history. 



A long and powerful poem by Mr. John Masefield, 
entitled " The Widow in the Bye Street," is the princi- 
pal feature of " The English Review " for February. 

Two novels soon to be issued by Messrs. William 
Rickey & Co. are "Downward," by Maud Curton Braby, 
and "The House of Chance," by Gertie de S. Wentworth- 
James. 

" Modern Books of Power " is the title of a forthcom- 
ing book of essays by Mr. George Hamilton Fitch, au- 
thor of "Comfort Found in Good Old Books." Messrs. 
Paul Elder & Co. will publish this volume early in April. 

Mr. Charles Whibley, author of " A Book of Scoun- 
drels," " Literary Portraits," etc., will publish shortly 
through Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. two new volumes 
of essays entitled " Studies in Frankness " and " The 
Pageantry of Life." 

Two new biographies of George Borrow are soon 
to appear in England. One of these, written by Mr. 
Herbert Jenkins, will be issued by the descendant of 
Borrow's original publisher, John Murray; the other is 
the work of Mr. Edward Thomas. 

The hitherto unpublished novel by H. de Balzac, re- 
cently discovered in Paris, will be published at once by 
Messrs. Rand, McNally & Co. under the title, " Love 
in a Mask." The same publishers also announce "Lady 
Eleanor: Lawbreaker," a novel by Mr. Robert Barr; 
and " Betty Moore's Journal," by Mrs. Mabel D. Corry. 

The attention of historical students is directed to the 
fact that competition is open this year for the Justin 
Winsor prize of .$200., awarded biennially for the best 
unpublished monograph based upon original and inde- 
pendent investigation in American history. Full details 
of the competition may be obtained from Professor C. H. 
Van Tyne, of the University of Michigan. 

Harvard University announces the immediate pub- 
lication of " A History of the British Post Office," by 
Professor J. C. Hemmeon of McGill University. In 
addition to an account of the development and present 
organization of the postal department of Great Britain, 
the book includes a discussion of the parcels post, the 
telegraph and telephone system, and similar subjects. 

" The People's Books," a sixpenny series of original 
contributions by authoritative writers on science, phil- 
osophy, history, economics, and literature, is announced 
by Messrs. Jack of London. " Shakespeare," by Pro- 
fessor C. H. Herford; "Dante," by Mr. A. G. Ferrers 
Howell; " Heredity," by Mr. J. A. S. Watson; " Berg- 
son and the Philosophy of Change," by Mr. H. Wildon 
Carr; and "Ethics," by Canon Hastings Rashdall, will 
be among the early volumes. 

The preparation of the late Henry Labouchere's 
biography, a book that ought to contain much highly 
entertaining reading, has been assigned by his executors 
to Mr. Labouchere's nephew, Mr. Algar Thorold, who 
requests that any letters likely to be of service in writ- 
ing the life be sent to T. Hart-Davies, Esq., care of 
" Truth," Carteret Street, Westminster, London. All 
papers sent in will be properly cared for, and will be 
returned in due course if desired. 

A Centenary Edition of Robert Browning's works, in 
ten volumes, printed in large type on fine paper, is an- 
nounced by Messrs. Smith, Elder & Co. A series of 
bibliographical and explanatory prefaces will be supplied 
by Dr. Frederick G. Kenyon, C.B., Principal Librarian 
of the British Museum. The edition will be limited to 



178 



THE DIAL 



[March 1, 



seven hundred and fifty sets. Each volume will have as 
a frontispiece a portrait of Robert Browning reproduced 
in photogravure, several of the portraits appearing for the 
first time. It is expected that Volumes 1 and 2 will be 
ready in May, the subsequent volumes following at short 
intervals so as to be completed in the Centenary year. 

Those interested in the establishment of public libra- 
ries and compelled, as is commonly the case, to figure 
pretty closely the various items of expense, will find 
valuable information and suggestions in " A Normal 
Library Budget and its Units of Expense," a paper read 
at a recent meeting of Pennsylvania librarians by Mr. 
O. K. Howard Thomson, of the James V. Brown Library 
at Williamsport. The paper is printed in the current 
issue of " Pennsylvania Library Notes." 

Some time ago a biography of Jane Austen by Canon 
Beeching was announced to appear in Messrs. Mac- 
mi Han's English Men of Letters " series. Canon 
Beeching has been obliged to abandon the volume, and 
it has now been entrusted to Dr. Warre Cornish, the 
Vice-Provost of Eton, author of a volume of " Essays 
on Poets and Poetry." Up to the present the only 
women who have been given a place in the " English 
Men of Letters " series are George Eliot, Fanny Burney, 
and Maria Edgeworth, though a biography of Mrs. Gas- 
kell, by Mr. Clement Shorter, has been announced. Miss 
Emily Lawless is the only woman who has contributed 
a volume that on Maria Edgeworth to the series. 

The Jersey City Public Library, one of the compara- 
tively few public libraries which make a practice of pub- 
lishing from time to time monographs of more than local 
or ephemeral interest, has contributed to the Dickens 
centennial literature, already rather abundant, a pam- 
phlet on the life and writings of that novelist. The sig- 
nificant facts of his biography are briefly stated, and a 
chronological and descriptive list of his works is added. 
From the Brooklyn Public Library there comes a handy 
" List of Books and of References to Periodicals in the 
Brooklyn Public Library" on the subject of Charles 
Dickens. It is uniform in style and excellence with simi- 
lar bibliographies already issued by that library. 

In connection with the Dickens Centenary, Messrs. 
Houghton Mifflin Co. are preparing to bring out next 
month, in their series of limited Riverside Press Editions, 
" Charles Dickens : His Life and Works," by the dis- 
tinguished American writer and critic, Edward Percy 
Whipple. Forty years ago Mr. Whipple prepared a 
series of Introductions for a notable edition of the novel- 
ist's works. These Introductions have hitherto been 
held strictly as an integral part of that and of a succeed- 
ing edition; but now, in order that they may be more 
fully appreciated, they have been collected in two vol- 
umes, to be issued with an autobiographical and appre- 
ciative introduction on Whipple by Mr. Arlo Bates. 

The Bromley lecturer at Yale University this year 
will be Mr. A. Maurice Low, author of " The American 
People." The Bromley lectureship was endowed in 
1900 by Mrs. Isaac H. Bromley as a memorial to her 
husband, a member of the class of 1853, and for many 
yean prominently connected with the New York " Trib- 
une." The endowment provides a fund for lectures on 
journalism, literature, or public affairs. Among others 
who have lectured in the course have been Mr. White- 
law Reid, ambassador to Great Britain, and Colonel 
Harvey, editor of " Harper's Weekly." Mr. Low, it is 
believed, is the first Englishman who has been selected 
by the University trustees to deliver these lectures.

THE LIVING CORPSE 

A DRAMA 

By LEO N. TOLSTOI 

Translated from the Russian 

There is no question as to the tremendous power and 
simple impressiveness of this posthumous work, which 
is the literary sensation of the day, not alone in Russia, 
but throughout Europe. 

As a protest against certain marriage and divorce 
laws, the absurdity of which is portrayed with a satiric 
pen, " The Living Corpse,'' is a most effective document.

UNEXPURGATED VERSION 

FOR A NIGHT 

By EMILE ZOLA 

The first appearance in English of one of Zola's most 
interesting works and characterized by the incisive 
realism which is the distinguishing mark of the great 
French writer. 

The book contains two other Zola stories: "THE 
MAID OF THE DA WBER " and " COMPLEMENTS " 
each a gem of its kind and in a mood different from 
that usually associated with this author. 

The translation was especially made by A. M. Lederer.

but which is as intricate as it is important. He asserts " the influence of the

with the impartiality of a savant to whom pure speculation is irrelevant. 



The Abolition Crusade and Its Consequences

Starting with the present day scientific psychology, and 
its emphasis on both mind and body, the author endeav-

Lady Gregory has preferred going for her material to the traditional folk history rather than to the author- 
ized printed versions, and she has been able, in so doing, to make ln-i- plays more living. The choice of 
folk history rather than written history gives a freshness of treatment and elasticity of material which 
made the late J. M. Synge say that " Lady Gregory's method had brought back the possibility of writing 
historic plays."

Formerly Principal of the Indian Government School of Art and Keeper of the Calcutta Art Gallery- Author of "Indian

Illustrated with 33 plate* from photographs One volume, 10 in. x 7 in. $5.00 net 

This is a very original and very comprehensive introduction to the study of the main branch of Indian Art. namely Indian

that the religions beliefs, legends and hopes symbolized in them are not taken into consideration by the European critic. 
Here the author focusses the principal achievement of Hindu plastic art together with the leading religious ideas of Hindu 
mythology which that art expressed, so that a clear perception of the relation between the two is possible to the reader. The 
plates are admirable examples of the photographic art.

THEIR DAY IN COURT 

The Case of American Letters and Its Causes 
By PERCIVAL POLLARD 



SDieo.at loljno Oophino Doopital. 
Baltimore, on SDecembet 17, 1911, 

Percftml Pollaco 
in tt)f 43d pear ot ijio age 



IN the death of Mr. Pollard, American letters (world literature, in fact!) sustained a loss 
that could not be greater. Notable as were his achievements, they were but the shadows 
cast by a powerful figure advancing to the rescue of the literature of the English language, 
step by step, fighting like an avenging God. He was easily the greatest among the younger 
American authors. As a critic he had no superior in any land. 

" Their Day in Court " was published somewhat more than a year ago ; " Vagabond Journeys " 
was published the day of Mr. Pollard's funeral. In these two books his genius is best shown. 

Mr. Thomas Seccombe, in The Weekly Graphic (London): " He has kept me alive and awake aa few 
American critics since Lowell have done. . . . A clever and stimulating book. . . . Mr. Pollard, like Will 
Wimble, is a connoisseur of the lash. . . . Blazing in eulogy or knee-deep in slaughter, Mr. Pollard is con- 
summate. . . . Mr. Pollard's severity on the literary conscience of the man who knows how to write, and 
on the literary critics of America in general, appals me. ..." 

Boston Transcript : " For his outspokenness he deserves the sincerest thanks." 

St. Louis Post-Dispatch: "Like Nordau, the author has the whole field under consideration at his 
fingers' tips. . . . He does not merely condemn. He quotes, thus giving those he censures or indicts a 
hearing in their own defense." 

Mr. Frank Powell, in Vanity Fair (London): "A book about books which is as fascinating as a novel, 
which carries the imprint of a big personality ; a book which is humorous, fresh, and unconventional ; which, 
further, is all for the truth and the ' damns ' of life." 

Signor R. Nobili, in La Nazione (Florence) : "This is not merely a destructive work : it aims to recon- 
struct, and bring to light true worth. ... Of the success of the book we can judge from the stir it has 
caused everywhere." 

San Jose* Times : " The most brilliant volume of literary criticism published in the hut ten years." 

Mr. Charles Nirdlinger : "A book of surprises, ingenuous and often audacious ones as always happens 
when a man who is at once expert, candid, and brilliant declares himself. . . . Much too readable for a 
book of its kind ; anything so witty, spirited and independent will not be deemed to conform to the rules 
of the game." 

London Academy: "Quite the moat remarkable and honestly intentioned<book that has come out of 
America for many a long day." 

Mons. G. Saint-Aubin: "The foremost critic of the United States, Peroival Pollard, does not hesitate 
to declare that mediocrity dominates. ..."

VAGABOND JOURNEYS 

The Human Comedy at Home and Abroad 
By PERCIVAL POLLARD 

rPHIS volume does not pander so much to the needs of travellers as to their sense of 
humor. Its most ironic passages are made at the typical Anglo-Saxon tourists. We 
all like fun made of our neighbors ; it is not in human nature to feel that we ourselves are 
satirised ; no one makes fun of us. Yet for individual ironic comment on our own people 
you will search long in our current literature of travel. 

The book does not profess to inform. It does not direct us how to get there ; what luggage 
to take ; nor instruct us as to what must be seen, what avoided. All such general orders, 
thinks Mr. Pollard, surely affect only those that admit themselves without identity of their 
own the members of the rabble. This book is addressed to individuals. It is the 
whimsical record of an individual's adventures along the primrose path of entertainment. 

The book's range of comparisons, between Berlin and Boston, London and New York, 
Paris and Washington, will give the student of our central modern civilisation plenty of 
food for thought. 

Cooking and feminine fashions in Paris ; sports and masculine fashions in London ; open- 
air theatres in Switzerland and the Rhine country ; the pursuit of ancient art in Egypt and 
Florence, and of modern art in Munich; the pursuit of culture in Berlin and Boston, 
such matters as these engage the author, and should entertain the reader. Entertainment 
is the essential quality in the book. The reader may be lured into reading opinions con- 
trary to his own ; may be piqued by prejudices that he abhors ; but he is little likely to 
drop the book for its dullness. 

Sophisticated travellers will, it is believed, be continually amused by these passages. Inno- 
cents abroad, if resentful at first of an apparent unconcern for their welfare, will find, as 
they close the book, that they have unconsciously absorbed knowledge, and that they have 
begun to emerge from provincials into citizens of the world. 



Baltimore Sun : " . . . you will find the volume a never-ending delight, one to read and place 
upon the shelves, to take down and re-read again when the vision of Piccadilly Circus at night 
flashes across your mind, or the swarming Avenue de 1'Opera in all its glittering glory. In brief, 
' Vagabond Journeys ' is one of the best things Mr. Pollard ever did." 

Norfolk Virginian-Pilot and Landmark: "A book which Maupassant might have written had he 
been less sensuous and sensual ; which Washington Irving would have wished he had written, but 
which many admirers of < Travels by an American Clergyman ' will turn from in disgust as void 
of historical, geographical, or statistical information."

George the Third and Charles Fox : 

The Concluding Part of " The American Revolution " 

By the Right Hon. Sir GEORGE OTTO TREVELYAN, Bart., O.M. 

Author of "The Life and Letters of Lord Macaulay," and "The Early 

History of Charles James Fox." In Two Volumes. Vol. I. With 

Map. Crown 8vo. $2.00 net ; by mail, $2.18. 

"The Early History of Charles James Fox was published thirty-one years 
ago, in October, 1880. In the following December I accepted office as Secre- 
tary of the Admiralty, and perforce abandoned literature for an indefinite 
period to come. At the beginning of the next Session, in the lobby of the 
House of Commons, Mr. Justin M'Carthy did me the honour to express a 
wish that there existed a Statutory power for obtaining an Order of Court 
to compel me ' to finish Fox ' ; and I am very glad to think that my old 
friend is alive to read this book. Its two volumes of which the first is 
here, and the second is already more than half written will carry Fox up 
to the moment which, so far as personal success was concerned, proved to 
be the culminating point of his whole career. They will likewise include, 
and complete, the History of the American Revolution my tranquil and 
pleasant occupation during the later years of a life much of which was 
passed in stormier waters." From the Preface. 

William James 

By EMILE BOUTROUX, Membre de PInstitut. Translated from 
the second edition by ARCHIBALD and BARBARA HENDERSON. 
8vo. Pp. viii + 126. $1.00 net; by mail, $1.08. 

Beginning with a sketch of the career and works of William James, in 
which the intimate character of the union which existed between the man's 
life and his philosophy is clearly attested, the author proceeds to outline, 
briefly but comprehensively, the various phases of his philosophy as they 
unroll in his psychology, the point of departure for James, through the 
psychology of religion which justified for him his wider reach on to the 
pragmatism of his method and the suggestions of his metaphysical views 
of a radical empiricism. Then follows a chapter on his pedagogy and a 
concluding summary. 

Chapters From Modern Psychology 

By JAMES ROWLAND ANGELL, Head of the Department of 
Psychology in the University of Chicago. (The Ichabod Spencer 
Lectures delivered at Union College, 1911.) 8vo. Pp. viii + 308. 
$1.35 net; by mat7,$1.48. 

This book affords a bird's-eye view of the field of modern psychology. It 
presents in simple and intelligible form the salient features of each of the 
important divisions of psychological science. Among the various topics 
discussed are the methods and results of experimental psychology, the facts 
and theories of the connection between mind and brain, the vagaries of 
abnormal consciousness, including hypnosis and multiple personality, the 
peculiarities of social consciousness, the phenomena of animal mind, and 
certain aspects of the application of psychology to practical affairs. A brief 
but useful bibliography enables the interested reader to pursue further any 
of the subjects treated.

trated. 8vo. Pp. vi + 328. $2.00 ne.t ; by mail, $2.17. 

The numerous illustrations include a Map in colors, showing the entire 
known world at the date of this work, political divisions, national bound- 
aries, leading commercial centres, and trade-routes. 

" Valuable and very useful, and deserves particular notice. . . . The value of 
the Periplus lies not in its literary merits, but in the importance of this very 
early account of the trade of the Indian Ocean , and of the settlements around 
its shores, concerning which until this time we possess almost nothing of 
an intelligent and comprehensive nature." Philadelphia Public Ledger.

The Last Unpublished Works of 

LEO TOLSTOY 

PUBLICATION IN THE UNITED STATES AUTHORIZED 

BY ARRANGEMENT WITH HIS HEIRS 
r PHESE novels, stories, and plays were written during 
Tolstoy's ripe old age, but not published, owing to the 
author's conviction that he ought to devote his whole energy 
to the promulgation of social, political, and moral ideas. 
Called into being by the instincts, the habits, and the genius 
of this master story-teller, they represent in the highest de- 
gree the work of the author of "War and Peace," "Anna 
Karenina," and " Resurrection." Matchless stories they 
are, founded some of them upon great crises of his life, others 
upon his own intimate family experience, and told as only 
this giant among the novelists of the last century could tell 
them.

Sound in its Relation to Music 

CLARENCE G. HAMILTON, A.M. 

Price, postpaid, bound in cloth, $1.25. 

Students of music greatly need a handbook of acoustics as relating to music, one that has been brought in line 
with the latest discoveries and theories. The books now in the market are no longer dependable, the result 
being that this element in a course of music study is generally lacking. The author has presented the essential 
facts together with many interesting experiments and helpful figures and diagrams to make the principles clear. 
A good text-book for schools and colleges. 

The book is an ideal class book. The illustrations are 

fine. I will suggest its use as a text-book.

XANTE 

By ANNE DOUGLAS 
SEDGWICK 

"A novel so finely conceived and 
wrought out that it bears upon 
every page the stamp of great- 
ness. In its greatness it is hu- 
man, and fights for an ideal. In 
its art it is finely flexible and 
subtly wrought." 

"Madame Okraska (Tante) is a very 
complete characterization, individual, hu- 
man, done with a thousand artistic touches. 
But although she stands out so boldly from 
the novel's pages, the book is full of others 
that, less prominent, are hardly less living 
than she." New York Times. 

"Against Madame Okraska is set for 
contrast the absurdly dear and determined 
Mrs. Talcott, who for spiritual beauty in 
grotesque clothing must take her assured 
position in the gallery of immortal charac- 
ters of fiction." Boston Herald. 

"Lovers of robust fiction will have gen- 
uine satisfaction in reading 'Tante.' . . . 
And by robust fiction I do not mean highly 
romantic and exciting fiction, but fiction 
with substantial ideas, strong character delin- 
eation, and a mellow and humorous view 
of life. . . . 

"The habitual fiction reader will look 
long before finding a book o subtle and 
o facinating." ELIA W. PEATTIE, in 
Chicago Tribune.

Many an unusual piece of work goes unnoticed because

In justice to the author and illustrator of this book of 
animal portraiture, we wish to explain that the draw- 
ings were made from living models at an expense of 
time and patience which no one who has not attempted 
such a feat can realize. The result is real portraiture, 
not artistic guess-work; and many of the animals pic- 
tured may be seen to-day, just as they were drawn, in 
the Washington Zoological Park, where Uncle Sam 
keeps a family of thirteen hundred animals scattered, 
more or less, over its one hundred and seventy acres.

Did Jesus ever live, or is be a mythical personage like the deities of Greece and Rome ? To some this may be 
a startling question. But in recent years his actual existence has been vigorously questioned, and the subject is 
being given wide notice and discussion. The negative opinion has found supporters in America, England, Hol- 
land, France, and Germany. To present a complete aud unprejudiced statement of the evidence for Jesus' actual 
existence is the aim of this book.

SOCIOLOGICAL STUDY OF THE BIBLE: Showing the Development of the 

Idea of God in Relation to History. By LOUIS WALLIS. 

This book is written on the basis of the modern scientific interpretation of the Bible; but it approaches Bible 
study from a new standpoint, using the sociological method of research. The ancient Hebrew nation is treated 
as a social group originating at the point of contact between Amorite city-states and Israelite clans from tbe 
Arabian desert. The great struggle within that nation was primarily between the legal usages (" mishpatim ") of 
the constituent races. This conflict found expression very slowly in terms of antagonism between the gods of the 
Israelites and the Amorites (Yahweh and the Baals). 

Mr. Wallis* papers on the subject have been appearing for some years in The American Journal of Sociology; 
and they are entirely recast and revised for book publication.

THE MAGAZINE GIRL. 

This is the literary era of the wax doll with the 
brick-dust complexion. She stares at us from 
every news-stand. No self-respecting magazine 
ventures to issue forth without her picture on its 
cover. Head or bust or full length; walking, golf- 
ing, motoring; rampant, couchant, or regardant, 
she is the heraldic emblem under which the 
cohorts of periodicals charge to victory. 

Eighty or a hundred years ago there was a 
somewhat similar putting-forth of feminine 
charms in the "Books of Beauty," "Annuals," 
and "Keepsakes" of that period. Elegance 
was the note then, as prettiness is now. The 
duchesses were elegant in their boudoirs; the 
heroines of the poets were elegant against their 
backgrounds of storm or sunshine ; the wives of 
brigands were elegant in their mountain caves ; 
even the bare-legged peasant women tending 
their flocks, or reaping a ten-acre field with a 
twelve-inch sickle, were prevailingly elegant. 

We confess that we have a weakness both 
for the older female (one would not dare to call 
her woman) of the " Annuals," and the newer 
Girl of the Magazines. Of course both are dolls, 
and of the latter it may be said that the paint 
on her face has sunken in and circulates in her 
veins. If she were stabbed with one of her own 
hat-pins she would hardly exude a drop of real 
blood. But she is pretty ; and her vogue tes- 
tifies to the undying ideality of the race, its 
craving for beauty and romance "the desire 
of the moth for the star," and so forth. 

That is it ! For thirty years we have been 
wandering in the desert of realism. Our novel- 
ists have swathed us in sand, and burned us 
with pitiless light. We have starved and been 
athirst; we have panted for the shadow of a 
great rock or the softening veil of trees or mist. 
Now and then we have stumbled into an oasis, 
and we have fortunately been fed with manna 
from abroad. Oh, the horror of the retro- 
spect ! the gaunt sordid spectacle of life on 
New England or Pennsylvania farms or on the 
prairies of the West ; the descent into the In- 
ferno of New York slums ; the ever-recurring 
visions of middle-class life in factory and shop 
and mansion. It has been an orgy of the ordi- 
nary, a delirium of dulness, an apotheosis of 
the commonplace. 

So we do well to welcome the Magazine Girl, 



2lJ 



THE DIAL 



[March 1G, 



with all the literary output which she repre- 
sents. She does not work ; she is the creature 
of the leisure and opportunity and affluence 
which most of us covet. And Solomon was cer- 
tainly not arrayed like her. Give her time and 
she will develop into a genuine heroine. Her 
eyes will deepen with other emotions than desire 
for an automobile ride or a dinner at Sherry's. 
Her lips, which now discourse the slang of the 
studio or of the streets, will utter poetic phrases. 
She may attain to the wit of Rosalind, the tender- 
ness of Imogen, the gentle austerity of Isabella. 
She is at least on the right way. She sees the 
Promised Land on the edge of the desert. The 
flowery meadows of the Age of Gold, which 
always open to the purview of every great liter- 
ary epoch, are in sight. We have said that the 
new Magazine Girl does not work, and we 
must explain this apparent blasphemy against 
current ideas. Every sane human being wants 
to exercise his or her muscles and mind, wants 
to produce something, the labor of hands or 
brain, to justify existence. Health and sanity 
are only retainable on those terms. But there 
is a vast difference between voluntary labor, 
however extreme, labor done with pleasure 
and delight, and uncongenial work done at 
the command of a superior or at the bidding of 
necessity. Modern industrialism, we should say, 
is responsible for modern realism in literature. 
By its dreary uniformity and monotony it stunts 
body and soul alike, and makes its victims un- 
fit either to serve as models for great art or to 
enjoy the art when done. What is it that irre- 
sistibly attracts the soul of mankind to warfare? 
Is it not its freedom and variety of action, its 
culminating excitement of battle ? War is an 
intoxication, a play, for which men are willing 
to lose their lives. Imaginative literature is a 
less brutal form of intoxication, a less danger- 
ous kind of play. And as anything is praise- 
worthy which brings back this primal, central 
conception of literature, we think the Magazine 
Girl deserves credit. 

If play is the main purpose of imaginative 
literature, we are for the rigor of the game. 
The world is always loth to believe that there is 
any distinction between life and literature, 
that there is an unspanned gap between the two. 
Like children, it demands of every story, " Is 
this true ? " Literature is the profoundest kind 
of truth ; but it is far enough from being fact. 
Take the mere mechanical aspect of the case. 
Here you have an oblong volume wherein some 
hundreds of thousands of black marks on white 
paper are supposed to represent the solid earth 



and the superincumbent sky and the procession 
of life between them. Nay, this book which 
can be read in a few hours pretends to give the 
life history of some score or two of human be- 
ings, from their cradles to their graves. Obvi- 
ously we are a far way from reality, much 
further off than in painting or sculpture, which 
do give some palpable simulacrum of rxi^t. -m . 
The piece of literature cxi>ts only in the idea of 
the person who creates it, and in the minds of 
the people who read it. 

There are three main methods by which liter- 
ary creations may be effected. The first is the 
method of pure idealism. A richly endowed 
mind may draw from the cave of his own being 
the figures and scenes of a phantasmal world. 
He may deck and adorn it with the treasures of 
his own feelings and fancies, and spread over it 
a light that never was on sea or land. Some 
promptings from without he must have : he takes 
the names of visible persons and things, but he 
fills them out from his own stock of imagina- 
tions. Perhaps it is from some state of pre- 
existence that he acquires a notion of real exist- 
ence. Or perhaps it is the pollen from the 
poets of the past which impregnates and makes 
fruitful the buds and blossoms latent in his own 
mind. It is needless to say that in the hands 
of men entirely great this method is capable of 
tremendous successes. All poets follow it to a 
greater or less extent. Probably the best half 
of the greatest creations of literature are of this 
dream substance. It is doubtful whether human 
nature ever quite equals, either in good or evil, 
the supreme figures of fiction and poetry. Schil- 
ler and Shelley are the modern types of creators 
who have little hold on real life. " Does this 
remind you of Hellas? " said Trelawney to Shel- 
ley when they were viewing some Italian town. 
"No, but it does of Hell," answered the poet. 
He was indignant that life should disturb and 
belie his dream. The weakness of the idealistic 
method is that it becomes too wire-spun, it 
becomes a convention. It needs every now and 
then to be subjected to the rude shock of reality : 
its aerial visions need to be reborn out of earth, 
as the clouds are reborn out of the sea. 

The second method is that of realism or nat- 
uralism. An author sets himself to study a 
certain part or section of the life about him. 
He vivisects, dissects, analyzes, and photographs. 
He sets his models in a glass case and studies 
them from every point of view. He becomes a 
prodigy of notes, a marvel of memoranda. But 
in the first place, any man's life is too short to 
exhaust all the possibilities of any piece of exist- 



1912.] 



THE D1AJL

ence, and the patience of readers would balk at 
any true, full record. In the second place, per- 
spective and relation are lost, and what was 
intended to be extra true becomes absurdly 
false. In the third place, the volatile and essen- 
tial spirit of life, which is the only thing really 
worth while in literature, flies such close, mi- 
nute investigation. The thing was vital, and 
now it is a caput mortuum. Nevertheless, in all 
times the absolute facing of facts and the sin- 
cere attempt to record them has resulted in great 
literature. Aristophanes and Euripides, in part, 
Juvenal and Petronius, Rabelais and the authors 
of the Beast Fabliaux and Satires of the Middle 
Ages, Chaucer and Swift and Burns, are mas- 
ters of the real and natural. But perhaps real- 
ism has been best realized by the great idealists, 
by Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, Goethe. 

The third creative method is that of abstrac- 
tion. It is really a combination of the other two, 
neither of them being pushed to excess. An 
author views the world, as it were, by glimpses 
and glances. He takes enough from it to fill 
out his preconceived idea. He concentrates and 
condenses the things and persons of the world, 
and breathes his own breath into his creations. 
He builds up figures out of many models, or 
from a mere suggestion provided by one. He 
gives us the impression of true life while we know 
very well that no such life ever existed . If the 
originals of Hamlet or Falstaff or Rosalind, 
Mr. Shandy or My Uncle Toby, the Master of 
Ravenswood or Captain Dalgetty, Micawber, 
Pecksniff, or Mrs. Gamp, could be confronted 
with their literary doubles, we should see how 
immeasurably distant and different the two sets 
of personages were, how much has been left 
out of the real and how much has been put into 
the imaginary beings. Everything seems to be 
there, but everything has suffered a sea-change. 
What is intolerable in life, because of wicked- 
ness, foulness, or dulness, becomes not only 
tolerable but delightful in literature. Folly has 
the effect of wit, and weakness of power. To 
give us this brief abstraction and transformation 
of life is the greatest work of genius. 

But we must return to our theme and make 
an application of our discourse. Literature in 
America began with pure idealism. Poe, Emer- 
son, Hawthorne, Bryant, Cooper, and nearly all 
our first great flight of writers, built from the 
idea whether innate in their own natures or 
derived from Europe. Then came the men of 
fact, the students of contemporary life. They 
came in their multitude, men and women, and 
drove the idealists, thinkers, poets, from the field. 



We are now far enough from them partially to 
adjudge their product, and it certainly bears no 
comparison with the first vintage of our wits. 
Just at present a new sap seems to be rising in 
our midst. There seems to be the promise of 
a Spring, and that is why we pitch upon the 
Magazine Girl as a symbol of hope. She has a 
touch of poetry and idealism in her, and is, we 
hope, the prelude to a rich harvest of the wine 
of literature. CHARLES LEONARD MOORE. 



CASUAL C OMMENT. 



ALL-THE-YEAB-ROUND PUBLISHING, which has 
been, for obvious good reasons, advocated by the 
London " Book Monthly " as an improvement on the 
present system of two breathlessly busy seasons alter- 
nating with two more or less idle ones autumn and 
spring being the rush periods, midwinter and mid- 
summer the least active ones is made the subject 
of a noteworthy "symposium" of publishers, book- 
sellers, and librarians in the February issue of that 
magazine. Far from treating the proposal after 
the scornful fashion of Goldsmith's Mr. Fudge (in 
"The Citizen of the World") who maintained that 
"books have their time as well as cucumbers," the 
gentlemen called upon for an expression of opinion 
have discussed the matter seriously and intelligently 
in many instances, it is true, without much encour- 
agement for the proposed change, but in not a few 
with an emphatic advocacy of such change. Mr. 
John Lane not only writes sympathetically, but even 
asserts that some of his own most successful publish- 
ing has been done at the so-called dull times of the 
year, at the end of July, the beginning of August, 
and the middle of January. Some of the contri- 
butors to the discussion aver that even now there is 
practically no slack season in the book world that 
there is always something doing; others doubt the 
feasibility of a change ; and nearly all recognize that 
the booksellers even more than the book-publishers 
are responsible for the existing order. The book- 
sellers, of course, throw the blame (so to call it) back 
on the bookbuyers. Nevertheless, it has been noted 
that the public will buy novels and other light litera- 
ture as readily in summer as in winter. Why not, 
then, even things up by distributing the books of 
entertainment over the whole year, and leave the 
winter sacred to science, to history, to philosophy, 
and their like ? Some such equalization is certainly 
desired by literary journals and book-reviewers, 
while all who have the handling of books in the way 
of business would find themselves benefitted by the 
change. ... 

MB. HOWELLS'S SEVENTY-FIFTH BIBTHDAY, the 

first of this month, called forth many tributes of en- 
thusiastic admiration, high respect, and warm affec- 
tion. Amid the general chorus of congratulation 
and good wishes there have appeared numerous ap-

preciative comments on his work as an author, from 
men and women whose words carry weight. Nat 
urally enough it is the unapproachable and all but 
faultless literary style of Mr. Howells that these 
admirers of his delight to dwell upon, after doing 
justice to the charm of the man as self-revealed in 
his writings, and to the genius displayed in his won- 
derful pictures of American life and character. 
Indeed, it is a never-ceasing marvel to note the inev- 
itable ease and precision and lucidity, the grace and 
finish and geniality, of his every utterance. The 
facility and felicity of it all, the naturalness and 
seeming unstudiedness, deceive the unwary reader 
and tempt him to imagine that he too could have 
written those smooth and polished periods if the im- 
pulse had seized him. The ease of the true artist, 
however, is a thing concerning whose. acquisition 
probably the artist himself could tell us a good deal 
that we had never suspected. That Mr. Howells 
may continue to practise his art a good number of 
years still, is a hope that cannot seem extravagant 
to anyone who recalls the prolonged activity of the 
ever-youthful Mrs. Howe, Colonel Higginson, and 
John Bigelow. 

A LEGISLATIVE REFERENCE DEPARTMENT FOR 

THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS is now advocated by 
Representative Nelson of Wisconsin, and he has in- 
troduced a bill to establish such department The 
project has had a thorough airing, and speakers in 
its favor, including Ambassador Bryce, Mr. Herbert 
Putnam, Dr. McCarthy of the Wisconsin legisla- 
tive reference bureau, Speaker Clark, and others, 
have sufficiently demonstrated the need of expert 
assistance such as the proposed department would 
furnish to our national legislators in the proper and 
intelligent framing of laws. Inasmuch as already 
fourteen states and many cities have established 
bureaus of this sort, and the movement is rapidly 
gathering further impetus, no detailed explanation 
of the beneficent functions of the proposed bureau 
should be needed to convince the intelligent ob- 
server of its desirability at Washington. Neverthe- 
less one congressman, in the hearing before the 
Committee on Library, felt called upon to object to 
its establishment, on the ground that every repre- 
sentative or senator with a bill to introduce ought 
in person to go through all the drudgery of its 
draughting, collecting his data and looking up the 
already existing statutes in the same field, in order 
to be able to speak with understanding in behalf of 
his bill when he presents it for legislative action. 
What, pray, is a man sent to Congress for, if not 
for just such work? asks the objector, apparently 
forgetful that this an age of specialization. 



AN UNWRITTEN CHAPTER IN HAWTHORNE'S LIFE 

unwritten, that is, in all its details has to do with 
his unceremonious removal, in 1849, from the posi- 
tion of surveyor of customs of the port of Salem, and 
with the indignant remonstrance which this ruthless 
application of the spoils system called forth from 



some of his friends. The Library of Congress ha 
asked the Treasury Department to transfer to the 
library's keeping a file of papers relating to Haw- 
thorne's appointment ami n-movul. Among letters 
urging the appointment are those written by George 
Bancroft and Franklin Pierce, while among those 
protesting against the removal arc l.-tt.-r- from Rufua 
Cboato and Horace Mann. Another interesting 
paper is a memorial from certain of the Whigs of 
Salem setting forth the reasons why, in their opinion, 
a discharge of Democratic officials at the customs 
house in favor of Whigs was a thing to be desired. 
That this desirable change was presently effect -il 
need not surprise anyone. The official papers in the 
case have not been preserved in their entirety, but 
a sufficient number of interesting documents appear 
to be extant to furnish an authentic and significant 
record of this episode in the novelist's life. Already 
the Essex Institute at Salem has procured photo- 
graphic reproductions of these papers, and they are 
to be used in a work relating to Hawthorne now said 
to be in preparation at the hands of the Institute's 
secretary, Mr. George Francis Dow. 



THE ENGLISH PROTEST AGAINST PERNICIOUS 
LITERATURE, as voiced by the editor of "The Spec- 
tator," who recently acted as chief spokesman of a 
deputation before the Home Secretary, revives a 
wearisome discussion in which it is all but impos- 
sible to take part without incurring the charge of 
either prudishness or license. What constitutes im- 
morality in literature apart from the grossly inde- 
cent productions that the police already have power 
to suppress will always remain an open question 
as surely as that manners and customs and the cri- 
terions of propriety and impropriety will ever con- 
tinue to shift and vary from age to age and from 
country to country. The Home Secretary's promise 
that the government would gravely consider the 
problem and deal with it energetically, was no more 
than might have been expected ; but what sensible 
person really expects or even desires the establish- 
ment in England of anything in the nature of an 
official censorship of printed matter ? However, we 
shall see what we shall see. Meanwhile, those who 
are greatly exercised on the subject, and who feel 
convinced that something ought to be done, will en- 
joy reading Canon Rawnsley's vigorous assault on 
the purveyors of immoral literature, in the current 
number of " The Hibbert Journal." 



THE LIBRARY REPORT AS LITERATURE that i 8, 

as a contribution to the " literature of power" as 
distinguished from the "literature of knowledge" 
often and necessarily leaves something to be de- 
sired; but not always. For instance, the poetical 
Mr. Ballard, of Pittsfield, Mass., has on at least one 
occasion accomplished the feat of putting his annual 
record of progress into smoothly-flowing verse ; and 
the Visiting Committee of the Boston Public Library 
succeeded in imparting a very human quality to one 
section of a recent report of that institution, by means 



1912.]

of graphic and touching descriptions of life among 
the lowly lovers of books. And there are other 
instances. The Enoch Pratt Free Library of Balti- 
more, as a very recent example, issues a "Twenty- 
sixth Annual Report" (from the pen of its head, 
Dr. Bernard C. Steiner) which is something more 
than a shivering skeleton of statistics. It is clothed 
with flesh and pulses with life. The eye rests grate- 
fully on occasional apt quotations, as, for example, 
a tine passage from " Instructions Concerning Erect- 
ing of a Library," by Gabriel Naudd; and another 
from Edward Everett Hale; and still another from 
Mr. Frederic Harrison ; and one from Hazlitt ; and 
others besides. Nor does the human interest lan- 
guish for want of incidents from real life. Truly, 
there is more in this modest-looking blue-covered 
pamphlet than the casual observer would suspect, 
and far more than we can here do justice to. 



GOLD BRICKS OF THE BOOK-TRADE, the " de luxe " 
subscription books that cost perhaps a dollar or two a 
volume to manufacture, and that sell at ten or twenty 
times as much, form the subject of a recent sprightly 
article by Mr. Robert Sterling Yard in the " Satur- 
day Evening Post." He casts no reflections on the 
"Houghton Mifflin-Scribner-Little Brown kind of 
limited editions," but mercilessly scores the manifest 
frauds which unscrupulous dealers unload on a too 
willing public. This is the way it is done : " A little 
group of speculators will get up a set of books printed 
from old plates they 've bought somewhere here at 
a bargain; hire some college professor or other 
generally at a good price, too to write an essay for 
an introduction; reproduce in mere half-tone some 
fine old prints they've bought at auction good 
things, maybe, and never used before; get an artist 
of accomplishment to design a special title-page and 
cover the cover adapted from some fine old English 
or French binding and there you are!" Among 
the amusing incidents of the trade occurs the follow* 
ing: "A few months ago a woman's executors sued 
to recover on a set of Shakespeare, ' specially printed 
for Mrs. Blank,' for which she had paid an absolutely 
fabulous price on the strength of each volume hav- 
ing been ' signed by the author.' " Verily, a fatuous 
book-buyer and his money are soon parted. 

ONE VIEW OF LITERARY ART that is of interest 
in connection with Mr. Labouchere's recent death is 
his assertion, in his early journalistic days: "It has 
always appeared to me that the making of an art 
[article] requires two persons, one to write it, the 
other to cut it down and generally to cut out what 
the first man most admires." Another saying of his, 
quoted, with the foregoing, by a former associate of 
Labouchere's, and printed in the London " Truth," 
reminds one of Walter Scott's fine indifference as 
to what may or may not have flowed from his pen. 
When apologies had been offered for cutting out a 
part of the brilliant journalist's matter, he wrote back : 
" You need not sentimentalize about my stuff. I send 
it to you to do what you like with." And again : " I 



am the only person, I believe, on the Press who does 
not care in the least whether his lucubrations do or 
do not appear in print." Probably his pecuniary 
independence had something to do with this careless 
attitude toward his articles, and this in turn may 
have contributed no little to the dash and freedom 
and scorn of consequences that characterized his 
style. It is not every editor that can indulge in the 
luxury of courting libel suits to the extent allowed 
himself by the founder and proprietor of " Truth." 

A STATE-WIDE SPELLING MATCH soon to be held at 
the capital of Missouri owes its originating impulse, 
apparently, to the zealous activity of the Macon 
County best-spellers, who by the time this is in print 
will have spelled one another to the last ditch, leaving 
the sole survivor to champion the county in the state 
contest. Of course the local preliminary matches 
leading up to the county contest have been going on 
in spirited fashion for weeks, and the whole thing has 
been, in its way, a great educational event, recalling 
our good old New England spelling bees, intellectual 
tournaments unknown to those of the present gen- 
eration who are taught to read without learning the 
alphabet, and to spell without naming the letters. 
Alas, that this festive banquet of fun and philology 
should have become so nearly a thing of the past 
with us ! But its revival in the Mississippi valley is 
a cheering sign, and not even the baleful activity of 
the reformed spellers, striving to bring all ortho- 
graphy down to. the dead level of a monotonous and 
characterless simplicity, shall prevent our taking 
heart of hope and looking forward to still further 
manifestations of popular attachment to the spelling 
and the spelling matches of our fathers. 

THE MAINTENANCE OF THE NEW YORK PUBLIC 

LIBRARY, the magnificent institution recently opened 
to general use and already having a record of nearly 
two million visitors, is calling for magnificent appro- 
priations from the city treasury. The estimated 
running expenses for the current year come within 
twenty thousand dollars of the half-million mark, 
and only seveny-four thousand has been set aside for 
books and binding. The librarian would like, and 
doubtless could make good use of, one hundred and 
fifty thousand a year for the purchase of books, and 
seventy-five thousand for binding. It is interesting 
to compare with these figures the Boston Public Li- 
brary's annual expenditure of about three hundred 
and fifty thousand dollars, a seventh part of which 
goes for new books. But the mere physical im- 
mensity of the sister institution in New York, with 
its staff of nine hundred and twenty-seven members, 
makes a thousand dollars look very much, as the 
slang of the street might express it, "like thirty 
cents." ...

THE FRKE ADVERTISEMENT OF ADVERSE CENSOR-

acceptable service of procuring a wider reading for 
his new play, "The Next Religion," than would have 
been otherwise probable. Published at two shillings, 
under the ban of the official censor of stage produc- 
tions, it will be well within the reach of many who 
would not have felt able to buy the ticket, or two 
tickets, for such theatre seat or seats as self-respect 
and acoustic conditions demand. The piquant sauce 
of censorship, while it imparts relish to the dish, 
need not of course imply any injurious amount of 
spice. Perhaps the play in question contained some 
reference to the Deity, as it could hardly fail to, from 
its title, or otherwise transgressed the time-honored 
rules by which the presentability of British plays 
has been so arbitrarily determined. But certain 
cis-Atlantic demonstrations in connection with one 
of Synge's plays as presented on the American stage 
ought perhaps to silence us on the subject of trans- 
Atlantic censorship of the drama.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

FRANCISCO FERRER AND THE CATHOLICS. 
(To the Editor of THK DIAL.) 

Since the appearance of my review of Mr. William 
Archer's " The Life, Trial, and Death of Francisco Fer- 
rer," in your issue of January 16 last, I have received 
from Catholic sources two little volumes which are prob- 
ably of sufficient interest to warrant my calling atten- 



tion to them here. One is entitled "Francisco Ferrer: 
Criminal Conspirator," and is the work of Rev. John A 
Ryan of St. Paul Seminary. It makes a careful analysis 
of Mr. Archer's book in an attempt to show, from the 
information that the author himself furnishes, that 
Ferrer received a fair trial and deserved death on the 
basis of the practice of the average civili/ed country 
Father Ryan lays no claim to first-hand knowledge of 
Ferrer in particular or of Spanish institutions in <;eneral. 
The other volume, issued with a preface by Mr. Paul 
Blakewell, of the St. Louis bar, is a collection and re- 
print of a series of English magazine articles by Mr. 
Hilaire Belloc. Mr. Belloc maintains that tin- interna- 
tional outbreak at Ferrer's death was a carefully-planned 
move in an international anti-Catholic conspiracy in 
which the press of the world is involved and of which 
Mr. Archer's book was a detail, and calls the attention of 
Catholics to the recent establishment of an International 
Press Agency under the control of the Church. This 
pamphlet bears the title " A Conspiracy and Its Ageney." 
Father Ryan's monograph is quiet and reasonable in 
tone, Mr. Belloc's violent and bitter. I infer that either 
may be secured by writing for it, the former to B. Herder, 
Publisher, St. Louis, and the latter probably from Mr. 
Blakewell. ROY TEMPLE HOUSE.

Concerning " St. Anthony's Sermon to the Fishes,"

I have in the form of a newspaper cutting many yean

port, R. I., which is headed " From a German versifica- 
tion of a passage of Abraham a Santa Clara, a Jesuit 
preacher of the Seventeenth Century." Mr. Brooks's 
version seems to me brighter than most other renderings 
which have fallen under my eye, although pretty free 
in its rhymes. The last of the eight stanzas of his trans- 
lation runs in this wise: 

" When sermon was ended 

To their businesH all wended ; 

The pikea to their thieving, 

The eels to good living ; 

The crab still goes crooked, 

The codfish is stupid. 

Yet none of them ever 

Heard sermon so clever."

A POET AXD HIS CIRCLE.* 



"When it is remembered that the letters pub- 
lished by Lord Tennyson in the " Life and Let- 
ters" of his father were selected from more than 
forty thousand, and, further, that the poet's wide 
circle of friends and correspondents included 
many of the most gifted men of his time, it will 
be seen that no lack of highly interesting material 
need embarrass the compiler of a volume supple- 
mentary to the biography. Rather, his embar- 
rassment will arise from an excess of material. 
"Tennyson and his Friends," from the same hand 
that gave us the "Life and Letters," is a full sheaf 
of memories and correspondence gleaned from the 
same general field that produced the larger work 
of fifteen years ago. Among the recollections 
put upon paper by those whose remembrance 
runs back to the mid- Victorian days of the poet's 
prime, are to be especially noted the initial 
chapter, "Recollections of my Early Life," 
written at her son's request by Emily, Lady 
Tennyson, in 1896 ; Mr. Charles Tennyson's ac- 
count of the three Tennyson brothers ; the paper 
on FitzGerald and Carlyle in their relations to 
Tennyson, by Dr.Warren of Magdalen College ; 
the reminiscences of Tennyson contributed by 
the Master of Trinity College, Cambridge ; and 
Mr. Arthur Coleridge's " Fragmentary Notes of 
Tennyson's Talk." The book also contains the 
centennial addresses on the poet by Mr. Arthur 
Sidgwick and the late Professor Henry Butcher, 
and the "Edinburgh Review" article by the 
late Sir Alfred Lyall on " Tennyson : His Life 
and Work," written on the occasion of the ap- 
pearance of the biography. Among the numer- 
ous letters inserted or quoted from, those writ- 
ten by FitzGerald to Tennyson, and mostly new 
to the reading public, deserve foremost mention. 
Others by Frederick Tennyson are nearly as 
good, and some from James Spedding are full 
of interest. Twenty-five of Tennyson's shorter 
poems, addressed to as many of his friends, are 
reprinted, as is also Dr. John Brown's chapter 
on Arthur Hallam from the " Horae Subsecivae," 
while an appendix contains some miscellaneous 
letters from unknown admirers of the poet, and 
other appropriate matter. 

The near views of Tennyson's relations and 
intimate friends which the book furnishes are 
hardly less welcome than the occasional passages 
touching on the poet'sown personality and habits. 

* TENNYSON AN HIS FRIENDS. Edited by Hallam, Lord 
Tennyson. Illustrated. New York : The Macmillan Co. 



One is glad to learn here something more about 
the " strong, haughty, and passionate " Fred- 
erick Tennyson of FitzGerald 's letters. There 
was in both men the same admirable sturdiness 
of independence, the same hatred of senseless 
conventionality, the same determination to live 
his life each in his own way. And in the case 
of each a sufficient fortune was inherited to 
make easily possible this unsocial but not neces- 
sarily unattractive mode of existence. From 
Mr. Charles Tennyson's chapter on the Tenny- 
son brothers we quote : 

" But Frederick was too much of a man of moods to 
care for society. He used to describe himself as a 'per- 
son of gloomy insignificance and unsocial monomania.' 
Society he dismissed contemptuously as ' Snookdom,' 
and would liken it gruffly to a street row. The ' high- 
jinks of the high-nosed ' (to use another phrase of his) 
angered him, as did all persons ' who go about with 
well-cut trousers and ill-arranged ideas.' " 

As is well known to readers of the FitzGerald 
letters, the Woodbridge recluse could make no 
headway with Browning's poetry, and in fact 
refused to acknowledge greatness in any con- 
temporary poet but Tennyson, whom however 
he held to have sadly declined from his earlier 
heroic manner. Frederick Tennyson's attitude 
toward Browning the poet was strikingly simi- 
lar, even though he delighted in Browning the 
man. In a letter to a friend he wrote: 

" What you say of Browning's ' Ring and the Book ' 
I have no doubt is strictly applicable, however slash- 
ing. ... I confess, however, that I have never had the 
courage to read the book. He is a great friend of 
mine. . . . But it does not follow that I should put up 
with obsolete horrors, and unrhythmical composition. 
What has come upon the world that it should take any 
metrical (?) arrangement of facts for holy Poesy ? It 
has been my weakness to believe that the Fine Arts and 
Imaginative Literature should do something more than 
astonish us by tours deforce, black and white contrasts, 
outrageous inhumanities, or anything criminally sensa- 
tional, or merely intellectually potent." 

From the many passages on the poet Tenny- 
son and his art, a few selections will be not out 
of place here. Speaking of his " Crossing the 
Bar," he declared : " They say I write so slowly. 
Well, that poem came to me in five minutes. 
Anyhow, under ten minutes." And afterward 
Lady Tennyson confirmed what he had implied 
concerning his usual rate of composition. It 
was rapid rather than slow. In the chapter 
entitled "Recollections of Tennyson," by the 
Master of Trinity (Dr. Butler), a significant 
reference to Tennyson's feeling toward Brown- 
ing, and also his admiration for Wordsworth, 
arrests the attention. 

" I noticed that he never spoke of Wordsworth with- 
out marked reverence. Obviously, with his exquisite 



2-2-2 



THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



ear for choice words and rhythm, he must have' been 
more sensitive than most men to the prosaic, bathetic 
side of Wordsworth ; but 1 never heard him say a word 
implying that he felt this, whereas I have heard him 
qualify his admiration for Robert Browning's geniu-> 
and his affection for his person by some allusion to the 
roughness of bis style. This, he thought, must lead to 
his being less read than he deserved in yean to come, 
and he evidently regretted it." 

A passage from Mrs. Butler's journal of a 
visit to Farringford in January, 1892, gives 
instances of the poet's well-known resentment 
of unjust criticism. She writes of a walk that 
she and her husband took with their host and 
his son. 

Montagu and he were in front, Hallam Tennyson 
and I behind. Montagu tells me how he was indignant 
with Z. for charging him with general plagiarism, in 
particular about Lactantius and other classics, ' of 
whom,' he said, ' I have n't read a word.' Also, of 
taking from Sophocles, ' whom I never read since I was 
a young man'; and of owing bis meanings of the sea' 
to Horace's gementis litora Bospori. Some one charged 
him with having stolen the ' In Memoriam ' metre from 
some very old poet of whom he had never heard. He 
said, in answer to Montagu's question, that the metres 
of both ' Maurice ' and The Daisy ' were original. He 
had never written in the metre of Grey's 4 Elegy,' ex- 
cept epitaphs in Westminster Abbey. He admired the 
metre much, and thought the poem immortal. . . . He 
told me that his lines ' came to ' him ; he did not make 
them up, but that, when they had come, he wrote them 
down, and looked into them to see what they were like. 
. . . Then he said again, what I have heard him say 
before, that though a poet is born, be will not be much 
of a poet if he is not made too." 

Tennyson's sensitiveness to criticism, as illus- 
trated in the foregoing, rather intensifies to us 
his human quality, and at the same time indi- 
cates an admirable modesty in the man. Had 
he been conscious of his true worth he would 
have seen that all these petty assaults, which 
seemed to him so vexatious, were really not 
worthy of notice and would weigh not the mil- 
lionth of a milligram in the balance against him. 
Other human traits come out in anecdotes told 
about him and by him. Among the stories of 
his Cambridge days occurs the following : 

"A wine-party was going on in Arthur Hallam's 
rooms in the New Court, when enter angrily the Senior 
Dean, Tommy Thorp.' What is the meaning, Mr. 
Hallam, of all this noise ? ' 'I am very sorry, sir,' said 
Hallam, we had no idea we were making a noise.' 
Well, gentlemen, if you '11 all come down into the 
Court, you '11 hear what a noise you 're making.' ' Per- 
haps,' admits Tennyson, I may have put in the all.' " 

Here is a characteristic bit from " Old Fit/. 
and curiously similar to the passage already 
quoted from Frederick Tennyson. It is from a 
letter to "My dear old Alfred," which begins 
thus: 

"I abuse Browning myself; and get others to abuse 



him; and write to you about it; for the sake of easing 
my heart not yours. Why is it (as I asked Mrs. Ten- 
nyson) that, while the Magazine critics are belauding 
him, not one of the men I know, who are not inferior to 
the writers in the AthMi:riim. K<Hnburgh,etc.,can endure, 
and (for the most part) can read him at all ? I mean his 
hist poem. Thus it has been with the Cowells, Trinity 
Thompsons, Donnes, and some others whom you don't 
know, but in whose candour and judgment I have equal 
confidence, men and women too. 

" Since I wrote to your wife, Pollock, a great friend 
of Browning's, writes to me: I agree with you about 
Browning and A. T. I can't understand it. Ter conatus 
eram to get through the Ring and the Book and fail- 
ing to perform the feat in its totality, I have stooped to 
the humiliatiou to point out extracts for me (they hav- 
ing read it all quite through three times) and still could 
not do it. So I pretend to have read it, and let Browning 
so suppose when I talk to him about it. But don't you 
be afraid* (N. B. I am not, only angry) 'things will 
come round, and A. T. will take his right place again, 
and R. B. will have all the honours due to his learning, 
wit and philosophy.' " 

The chapter of " fragmentary notes of Ten- 
nyson's talk " has many quotable sayings. I 
am sorry,'* said he on one occasion, "that I am 
turned into a school-book at Harrow ; the boys 
will say of me, *That horrible Tennyson.' The 
cheapness of English classics makes the plan 
acceptable to schoolmasters and parents." " My 
prize poem Timbuctoo ' was an altered version 
of a work I had written at home and called 
' The Battle of Armageddon.' I fell out with 
my father, for I had no wish to compete for the 
prize and he insisted on my writing. To my 
amazement, the prize was awarded to me. I 
couldn't face the public recitation in the Senate 
House, feeling very much as Cowper felt ; Mer- 
ivale declaimed my poem for me in the Senate 
House." My tailor at Cambridge was a man 
of the name of Law. When he made his way 
into our rooms, and worried us about paying our 
bills, we used to say, This is Law's Serious 
Call.' " A similar Oxford tradition concerns 
the Oxford tailor, whose name was Joy. The 
undergraduates, after a liberal indulgence in 
port wine, used to say : " Heaviness may endure 
for a night, but Joy cometh in the morning." 
Tennyson's love of animals is illustrated in the 
following : " 1 could imitate the hoot of an owl, 
and once practised successfully enough to attract 
one which flew in through iny window. The 
bird soon made friends with me, would sit on 
my shoulder and kiss my face. My pet monkey 
became jealous, and one day pushed the owl off 
a board that 1 had raised some feet from the 
ground. The owl was not hurt, but he died 
afterwards a Narcissus death from vanity. He 
fell into a tub of water contemplating his own 
beauty, and was drowned."

Among the tributes of admiration from read- 
ers in many lands, there are some from America 
that will make the American reader blush for his 
country, even while he laughs. For example : 

" Will you accept the enclosed lines as a slight testi- 
monial of the high admiration entertained for your ex- 
quisite genius, by a rhyming daughter of Columbia; whose 
poetic wings just fledging from a first unpublished vol. 
(commended by Wm. Cullen Bryant and Geo. Bancroft, 
Esqrs.) permit only a feeble fluttering around the base 
of that ' Parnassus,' whose summit you have so bril- 
liantly, and justly attained." 

An angler for autographs writes as follows : 

"SiR I hope that you will kindly excuse the liberty 
I take in requesting you to be so good as to inform me 
how the word 'humble' should be pronounced: i.e. 
whether or not it is proper to aspirate the ' h '? A reply 
at your kind convenience will inexpressibly oblige. . . ." 

One would like to know how these and count- 
less other similar importunities were borne by 
the victim. He must have amassed a consider- 
able library of gift volumes of verse from unre- 
nowned poets that is, if he kept these offerings. 
To have read all the printed and unprinted 
metrical effusions sent to him, commonly with 
request for criticism (and with fond hopes of 
praise), would have been impossible. 

As a treasury of literary and personal remi- 
niscence and anecdote, embellished with appro- 
priate illustrations, "Tennyson and his Friends" 
is a book to revel in as the mood seizes one, and 
to read through in a season of leisure ; and by 
reason of its uniformity in style with the "Life 
and Letters," as well as for other and deeper rea- 
sons, it claims a place beside that earlier work 

from the same hand. T. . ^,

ECONOMICS MADE INTELLIGIBLE.* 



There is a dearth of good books in economics. 
Exhaustive monographs and voluminous inves- 
tigations there are in plenty. But even in the 
field of applied economics taxation, the labor 
problem, the trust problem, and the like it 
is difficult to find a really good book, a book 
written for men, not for college boys, a book 
intelligible to persons not already experts in the 
field, a book that covers its subject adequately, 
that is interesting yet free from bias. As for 
the general works on economics, those published 
in America prior to 1911 have all been designed 
primarily as university text-books, and very 
good text-books some of them are. But who 

* PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMICS. ByF. W. Taussig. In two 
volumes. New York: The Macmillan Co. 



ever reads a text-book unless as a task imposed 
upon him by authority? 

This lack of books written to meet the needs 
of the general reader is not, as many superficial 
thinkers urge, a serious reproach to the body of 
economic writers. It is the chief business of 
the economist, for the present at least, to con- 
duct investigations and to teach other men how 
to conduct investigations. The field of eco- 
nomics is a vast one, very inadequately explored. 
The force of investigators is too small, and their 
resources inadequate to the work. They are 
therefore compelled in many cases to content 
themselves with merely plausible working hypo- 
theses. In so far as the progress of the science 
consists in the substitution of reasonably cer- 
tain conclusions for tentative ones, the real sig- 
nificance of the work will almost inevitably 
escape the layman. In so far as it consists in 
the investigation of the hidden implications of 
the problems that lie on the surface an in- 
vestigation essential to the solution of these 
problems the progress of the science will ap- 
pear to the layman to be in the direction of bar- 
ren subtleties. What layman can understand 
why economists have in recent years devoted so 
much energy to the "minutiae" of the value 
problem ? As a scientific investigator, the econ- 
omist must select his problems without refer- 
ence to the immediate popular interest. If he 
can make it clear to his co-workers in the science 
what he is driving at, and why, it is usually all 
he can do, and all he can be expected to do. It 
is all that the professional chemist or physicist 
does. Economics as a science, like most other 
sciences, assumes by necessity a somewhat eso- 
teric form. 

But, unlike other sciences, economics must 
in the end divest itself of the esoteric if it is to 
be at all useful. Society can enjoy the fruits 
of discoveries in the physical sciences, the na- 
ture of which only the select few understand. 
There is no reason why even a considerable 
minority of the population should understand 
the principles underlying wireless telegraphy; 
the invention is none the less put to its most 
effective use. The invention of a new plan for 
regulating bank-note issues, on the other hand, 
must remain without practical result until a 
working majority of society has become con- 
vinced of its worth. It follows that in econom- 
ics great value is properly ascribed to the work 
of a man who succeeds in making himself under- 
stood by the general public. Accordingly almost 
all economists will regard Professor Taussig's 



THE DIAL 



[March Iti, 



" Principles of Economics " as a work of great 
importance. Some, no doubt, will deny that it 
contributes materially to the solution of any 
vital problem of economic science. Others 
perhaps will even assert that it is reactionary in 
its tendencies. But no one can deny that the 
book is a readable one, and intelligible, in the 
main, to anyone seriously interested in economic 
questions and willing to do a reasonable amount 
of thinking. 

The scope of the work is exceedingly wide. 
What may be termed the general principles of 
economics the organization of production, the 
laws of value, and the forces governing distribu- 
tion occupy Books I., II., and V. The re- 
maining five books cover the more important 
problems of economic policy money and bank- 
ing, foreign trade, labor problems, problems of 
economic organization (railway problems, trusts, 
socialism), and taxation. The discussion often 
ranges beyond the strict limits indicated by these 
captions, and in the end covers pretty nearly 
all of the economic field in which there is any- 
thing like generally accepted conclusions. 

Professor Taussig is one of those economists 
who believe in the essential soundness of the 
classical system of economics. Accordingly no 
one will be surprised to find that his theory of 
value is practically that of Mill, with some con- 
cessions to a more recent terminology. His 
theory of money is also constructed on the clas- 
sical model. The discussion begins with a bald 
statement of the quantity theory, followed by 
some two hundred pages of the qualifications 
necessary to adapt the theory to the facts of life. 
Despite all the qualifications, however, the orig- 
inal quantity theory of money remains as the 
governing principle in the field of price changes. 
The theory of international trade presented by 
Professor Taussig is also classical in outline. 
The argument for free trade here given is based 
upon the theory of comparative costs : it is for- 
tified, however, by the results of much concrete 
investigation in this field, in which Professor 
Taussig is acknowledged master. 

The author's theory of distribution is classi- 
cal in its emphasis upon the relation to the rate 
of wages of the forces governing the increase in 
population. It is also strictly classical in its 
conception of the nature of rent. A departure 
from the older political economy appears in the 
explanation of interest, which is described as 
originating in men's undervaluation in the pres- 
ent of goods that are designed for future use. 
What is perhaps most classical in Professor 
Taussig's theory is a certain ruthlessness of 



logic, a disregard for consequences of a revolu- 
tionary character that might be deduced from it. 
Other economists have displayed great ingenuity 
in arguing that property incomes are not deduc- 
tions from the product of labor, but are funda- 
mentally the product of the material instruments 
of production themselves. Professor Taussig 
rejects this view without serious discussion. 
Labor he regards as the sole source of income.

adds to production. Thus a first deduction from 
the product of labor consists in rents, royalties, 
and other differential gains. Even the rewards 
of superior management are to be regarded as 
the product of the labor subject to mauap 'incut. 
if we are to construe strictly some of the pas- 
sages in Professor Taussig's chapters on business 
profit (cf., Vol. II., p. 172). And since, under 
modern conditions, what the laborer produces 
is rarely fit for his own consumption, but must 
undergo further elaboration, be transported and 
warehoused until wanted, the laborer must re- 
ceive, not his marginal product, but a price for 
it, advanced by the capitalist. This price is not 
the price of the product when ready for con- 
sumption; it is that price, less the capitalist's 
discount. Thus interest appears to be a second 
deduction from the product of labor; and 
wages, so far from being the whole product of 
labor, are at most only the discounted marginal 
product. 

Such a theory of distribution might appear 
to serve as a basis for an attack upon property 
incomes. No such attack is contemplated by 
Professor Taussig, who seeks justification of 
concrete incomes not in the abstract principles 
of productivity but in broad considerations of 
social utility. Interest, rents, and profits are 
defended on the ground that such incomes must 
exist if society is to be adequately supplied with 
capital, if its natural resources are to be properly 
utilized, if men are to assume the risks attendant 
upon the introduction of new processes. Profes- 
sor Taussig recognizes that the existence of such 
incomes makes for serious inequalities among 
men a prolific source of discontent and disor- 
der. In so far their tendency is evil. He be- 
lieves that some mitigation of existing inequalities 
is possible through a development of popular 
education with consequent equalization of oppor- 
tunity, and through assumption by the State of 
the duty of relieving some of the most serious 
hardships that now weigh upon the poor the 
hopeless destitution of old age, the ' miseries re-

suiting from industrial accidents and protracted 
illness. A quickened sense of obligation on the 
part of the rich may also assist in mitigating the 
evils of inequality. The author does not, how- 
ever, anticipate radical changes in the near 
future. " The main features of the existing dis- 
tribution of wealth are likely to persist for an 
indefinite period in the future : shorn, indeed, 
at either end, of the extremes of abject poverty 
and endless riches, but still with rich and poor, 
leisure class and well-to-do class and working 
class, social stratification and the leaven of social 
ambition." (Vol. II., p. 256.) 

A consideration of Professor Taussig's theory 
of distribution leads naturally to an inference 
as to his attitude toward the labor movement. 
If wages are at most the " discounted marginal 
product of labor," how much chance is there 
that organized labor will succeed in its ultimate 
object of directing a greater and greater share 
of the social income stream toward itself ? This 
question is answered by the author in Book VI., 
under the caption "The Problems of Labor." 
In his view, all that organized labor can do is 
to secure for labor its full discounted marginal 
product. It can do nothing to change the basis 
of distribution. This doctrine of the limited 
efficacy of labor organization is taught, to be 
sure, by practically the whole body of economic 
theorists who are of classical antecedents. Its 
validity is vigorously denied by the leaders of 
the labor movement and by many of the scien- 
tific students of the labor problem. One who 
accepts it will almost inevitably display a cer- 
tain hostility toward organized labor, or at 
least impatience with its aims and methods. 
He is likely to look upon trade union exclusive- 
ness as vulgar monopoly ; restraints imposed by 
the unions upon their members and upon em- 
ployers he is apt to regard as a form of tyranny. 
Such practices of trade unions as lead to violence 
and the destruction of property will receive 
from him the more vigorous condemnation be- 
cause he regards the end toward which they are 
directed as an unattainable one. In this view 
the general public is forced to suffer all manner 
of inconvenience and injury while trade unions 
are trying out unlawful means to gain what the 
constitution of society makes it impossible for 
them to gain. Professor Taussig, to be sure, 
endeavors to maintain a sympathetic attitude 
toward trade unionism, and justifies himself in 
this by placing a great deal of emphasis upon 
the potency of the union to remove the minor 
disabilities under which the workers labor 
weakness in bargaining with large employers, 



etc. In the reviewer's opinion, this justification 
of trade unionism is inadequate. The gains 
do not appear to be commensurate with the 
costs, if we accept Professor Taussig's general 
doctrine. 

Are we compelled to accept this doctrine? 
Not by any argument presented by the author. 
When a body of workers gains control of a field 
of employment and forces up their own wages, 
this will no doubt be in part at the expense of 
other workers. If the textile workers secure 
a general advance in wages, a readjustment of 
textile prices will follow, laborers in general 
will pay more for their clothes. There are also 
losses to laborers excluded from a unionized in- 
dustry and exclusion of some applicants for 
admission is inevitable, if wages are to be kept 
above the average. Possibly other losses to 
labor must be added to these, before we can 
strike a just balance of the advantages and dis- 
advantages of an advance in wages restricted to 
a single industry. The point here made is, that 
Professor Taussig does not attempt to strike 
any such balance. He arrives at a conclusion 
of great practical significance without giving the 
reader an insight into the reasons upon which 
that conclusion is based. For this omission 
there are, to be sure, many precedents in the 
works of other economists who defend a similar 
position. And the reason is the same. To estab- 
lish the point scientifically would require an 
extremely laborious structure of mathematical 
analysis that could hardly find place in a book 
of this kind. And, since the analysis has never 
been made, it is possible that if it were worked 
out, it would support another conclusion. 

Professor Taussig's attitude toward socialism 
is a generous one. Men who know little of the 
character of the advocates of socialism are prone 
to assume that they are inspired as a rule by 
envy. Professor Taussig asserts that brotherly 
love, rather than envy, underlies the socialistic 
movement. Most of the stock arguments against 
socialism he dismisses as almost too trivial for 
consideration. His own criticism of socialism 
is that it underestimates the difficulty of check- 
ing excessive increase of population in a State 
in which responsibility for the child rests with 
the State instead of with the parents ; the diffi- 
culty of securing systematic effort in the per- 
formance of the routine tasks that will always 
make up the greater part of the world's work ; 
and the difficulty of insuring progress in indus- 
try when the rewards given under the present 
system for invention and for the assumption of 
the risks inseparable from the introduction of 



THE DIAL 



j March If., 



inventions are withdrawn. Professor Taussig 
sees no justification for the view that produc- 
tion in its existing state is sufficiently effective 
to secure a maximum of social welfare. The 
annual production of wealth, even in the United 
States, is less than $1,000 per family. We 
must do much better than that before we can 
regard the problems of production as solved. 
Private enterprise finds at every hand problems 
of production to solve ; accordingly it is far too 
early to talk of supplanting it by the relatively 
unprogressive forms of State activity. 

But a system of private enterprise cannot, in 
Professor Taussig's opinion, result in the great- 
est social good unless it is subject to effective 
State regulation. This is especially true in the 
case of monopolistic industries. The so-called 
public service industries, practically all persons 
now admit, must either be regulated with re- 
spect to charges and character of service, or must 
be owned by the State. For the present, the 
author holds private ownership and public super- 
vision to be practically best, in the United States 
at least. He contemplates for the future an 
increasing range of publicly-owned industries; 
and expresses hearty approval of the experiments 
in public ownership now under way in the leaser 
American cities. He is less disposed to approve 
of similar experiments in the great cities, where 
the political situation presents problems of far 
greater complexity. 

With respect to the trust question, Professor 
Taussig's position may be characterized as some- 
what more advanced than that of most of his 
contemporaries. His practical programme in- 
cludes the establishment of direct federal con- 
trol over all corporations doing an interstate 
business, enforced publicity as to the important 
details of corporate business, control of capitali- 
zation, and perhaps eventually of profits and of 
prices. 

Sufficient evidence has been given in the 
preceding paragraphs to indicate Professor 
Taussig's point of view a point of view fairly 
representative of that of the general body of his 
profession. Professor Taussig would be char- 
acterized, in the political phraseology of the 
day, as a Progressive. He accepts the existing 
economic system as fundamentally sound, an 
efficient system, which promotes not merely mate- 
rial progress, but the development of wholesome 
character in the great majority. At the same 
time, the system is full of evils, some of them 
inherent, but most of them eradicable if men 
would but take thought.

Tier. DOMAIN OK P-'K HOI.OI.Y.* 

The transformation of interest in psychologi- 
cal problems, the wide range of theory and prac- 
tice which they have assumed, and the general 
awakening to the importance of the field of 
mind, make timely a topographical survey of 
this domain, indicating the contours of trends 
and interests while yet free of encumbering de- 
tails. Such a survey is available in a peculiarly 
attractive form in the published lectures delivered 
by Professor J. R. Angell last year, as the first 
course upon the Spencer foundation in psychology 
established at Union College. 

Professor Augell has chosen to divide the field 
according to dominant problems and the methods 
developed for their pursuit. In addition he lias 
held in mind critically though hopefully the prac- 
tical applications of psychological doctrine to the 
art of living, which these various types of in- 
vestigation yield. The first lecture, upon Gen- 
eral Psychology, sets forth the professional and 
technical interest which supports the psycholo- 
gist in his attempt to analyze the basal processes 
of the mental operations. Here the bent of the 
analyst and of the practitioner lie somewhat 
apart, a divergence of purpose as well as of 
route. The discussion serves to remove the diffi- 
culty experienced by the layman in comprehend- 
ing the magnified proportion which analytic 
problems occupy in the professional mind. This 
difficulty is but a phase of the inevitable dis- 
crepancy between research and application. It 
implies on the part of the public a confidence in 
the judgment of the expert and in that wisdom 
born of scholarship, that is liable to develop 
an excessive scholastic absorption in self-made 
theories. Modern psychology is fortunate in 
finding salvation from the danger of the narrow 
interest that for centuries determined its lines 
of advance, through the mutual interactions of 
the several sciences dealing with life expressed in 
the vitalizing power of evolutionary principles. 
None the less, each science is entitled to the 
development of its own technique and to an 
intensive absorption in and basal elaboration of 
processes which must be interpreted and dis- 
sected as well as appreciated and applied. 

The second lecture is devoted to Physiologi- 
cal Psychology, and sets forth the commanding 
import of the nervous system as the conditioning 
instrument of the mental functions, of the man- 
ner in which the scope and quality of the senses 
and muscles, as inlets and outlets of the mind,

condition the type and efficiency of the mental 
life. More specifically the third lecture pursues 
the problem of Experimental Psychology, partly 
in an historical aperyu, by showing how one after 
another of the mental procedures has yielded 
to experimental ingenuity, to the control that 
apparatus and set conditions afford, while yet 
subject to the commanding condition of the 
supreme instrument of research the mind of 
the observer as well as the mind of the subject. 
Here lie the most distinctive relations differen- 
tiating psychology from other sciences ; for 
however expert the instrument of research, the 
mind with its limitations is at once the subject 
and the object of investigation. The conquest 
of the experimental field requires patience and 
technical analysis, as well as common sense, a 
perspective easily spoiled by crudity of design 
and execution. The peculiar idol of psychol- 
ogy may prove to be a love of figures and of 
the niceties of experiment for their own sake, 
and a consequent neglect of the inspiration 
which alone gives enduring value, that of the 
understanding of the problems as dominant and 
of the method as subservient to the ends which 
these impose. 

At this point the field subdivides with refer- 
ence to observation and practical application. 
One phase of this service is indicated by the 
word " clinical." Abnormal Psychology sug- 
gests the meeting place of the practitioner who 
regards mental health as essential as bodily 
health, but whose acquaintance with the vagaries 
of the mind gone wrong is not quite adequate 
to the comprehension of the lesser variations, 
the study of which forms the specific field of 
the psychology of the abnormal. From dreams 
to hypnotism ; from the action of drugs to di- 
vided and disorganized personalities ; from the 
belief in unusual mental powers that have ac- 
companied the development of the human race 
from ancient to modern times to their scientific 
interpretation ; in brief, from the normal relations 
and uses of mental trends to their most abnor- 
mal manifestations, whether in genius or insan- 
ity; all these transitions suggest the widening 
of the field, an extension of interest, and an ex- 
pansion of prospect which together contribute 
an enlarged insight and a comprehensive addi- 
tion to the field of mind. 

Individual and Applied Psychology set forth 
how these several aspects of the mind are con- 
cretely present in the only data that nature sup- 
plies, namely, the individual mind with indi- 
vidual endowments, set to a particular purpose 



and educated and developed to the uses of life. 
Here a caution is indispensable. The wisdom 
of practice is ever to be guided by the insight 
conferred by theory. Charlatanism in the field 
of mind has always flourished, and short-circuits 
to learning and the command of human re- 
sources are as misleading in modern as in an- 
cient guise. It is true that the complications 
of our busy life have brought forward in sharp 
outline such special problems as the appeal of 
advertising and the more detailed analysis of 
the processes which education uses for the ma- 
turing of mental powers. 

Social and Racial Psychology represent what 
in some respects is the dominant interest of the 
day. The socialization of impulses which are as 
ancient as the race, but which modern society 
is putting to new uses, has imposed on psy- 
chology a reconstruction of many of its funda- 
mental attitudes and as well has vitalized the 
older problems, making it necessary for the 
psychologist of to-day to be a man of the world 
rather than or in addition to being a man of 
the study and the laboratory. The racial aspects 
of mind set the older conditions imposed by 
nature in the differentiation of species hi con- 
trast with the social demands of civilized life, 
which the diverse ends and means of social or- 
ganization have introduced. This interest im- 
parts to the psychological manifestations of 
humanity an historical interpretation. It gives 
a valuable cumulative sense of the fact that 
history is but a record of mind applied by 
human ideals to the accomplishment of formu- 
lated purposes. 

Man is not the only representative of the 
mental kingdom indeed, in the same sense in 
which he who knows but one language knows 
none is it true that the human mind has only 
a limited and foreshortened perspective of 
the range of mental phenomena, unless there 
be added to this equipment an appreciation of 
what mind has done for the animal kingdom. 
Once more popular impression and exact study 
diverge in interest and result. Animal Psychol- 
ogy is valuable no less in reflecting the restric- 
tions to which the march of human endowment 
has been subject, as in contributing to the com- 
parative point of view which has proved of such 
large advantage in other fields. The problem 
presents an example of the general difficulty of 
reducing to exact form the processes that underlie 
expressions manifest enough in their general 
bearing but quite concealing their own proce- 
dure. In no field has there been such a peculiar 



2-2* 



THE DIAL 



temptation to interpret results by the acquired 
and inherent human prejudices as in the under- 
standing of animal behavior. " Nature fak i 1 1 - 
in the biological sense is quite secondary in 
importance to the misconstruction of what is im- 
plied psychologically in animal conduct. This 
leads naturally to Professor Angell's conclud- 
ing lecture on General Genetic Principles in 
Psychology, which presents the field of endow- 
ment as well as of achievement in stages of evolu- 
tion as well as of accomplishment, and makes it 
obligatory upon psychologists to trace momen- 
tous effects back to small beginnings. To differ- 
entiate between instinct and reason ; to observe 
community of purpose and process despite con- 
trast of personality and expression ; and in the 
individual as well as in the social field to observe 
how largely and how limitedly nature provides 
for the psychological vantage of men, all con- 
tribute to the perplexities of the genetic psy- 
chologist. The concentration of interest in the 
evolution of the child to the full stature of adult 
mentality purposely dominates, but its study 
profits by comparison with other phases and 
stages of evolutionary progress. 

It is important that such judicial surveys of 
general domains of knowledge should from time 
to time be made. They serve to keep the intelli- 
gent layman in touch with the advance that oc- 
cupies the scholar, and provide a rational basis 
of appreciation of what may be properly expected 
of professional pursuit. All sciences are subject 
to the benefit as well as the loss of encourage- 
ment that influence human action ; and to keep 
psychology vital requires some general apprecia- 
tion of its purposes and methods. In thus pro- 
viding the basis of appreciation this volume may 
be recommended as performing a worthy service 
in a worthy manner. Naturally the perspective 
of such a survey will vary with the interests and 
the appraisals of the surveyor. Professor Angell 
is at once critical and catholic. If the obligations 
which he has imposed upon himself to keep well 
within the field of the ascertained, to present 
both sides of all disputed points, and to make no 
excessive drafts on the attention of his audience, 
have here and there operated against the deci- 
siveness of his statements and the appeal of his 
presentations, he has at least the excuse that the 
temporal conditions of the lecture-room are less 
favorable than the more studious attitude of the 
reader. As a survey of the psychological domain, 
Professor Angell's latest volume will imme- 
diately assume the favored place which its con- 
spicuous merits warrant.

It has wellnigh come about, as Carlyle re- 
marked, that "the Creation of a \\ ,,rl,l is littl, 
more^ mysterious than the cooking of a dump- 
ling"; but the time has not yet arrived when 
men may look upon Poetry, the creation of an 
immaterial world, with as much certainty and 
as little abashment. The note of wonder that 
Wordsworth and Coleridge brought into th 
criticism of poetry has not yet given signs of 
surrender to pedantry and formalism; and the 
religious attitude toward poetry, synonymous, 
to Arnold, with "The Study of Poetry," 
poetry as a consolation and an interpretation of 
the perplexities of life, has allied itself with 
the attitude of wonder. 

In the lectures on poetry given by the twenty- 
fourth Professor of Poetry at Oxford, this atti- 
tude of wonder has almost, if not quite, gone to 
seed. Beginning with an excellent characteriza- 
tion of the formal and technical aspect of poetry 
as " patterned language " or rhythm in verses," 
and insisting, as Mr. Bradley had insisted, that 
form and substance are indissoluble, Mr. Mac- 
kail proceeds to seek an analogous definition of 
poetry as an imaginative expression of life. 
Milton's description of a true poem as "a com 
position and pattern of the best and honourablest 
things " is apparently behind the analogy drawn 
by Mr. Mackail. "Just as the technical art of 
poetry consists in making patterns out of lan- 
guage, so the vital function of poetry consists 
in making patterns out of life." " These pat- 
terns," he goes on, " are latent and implicit ; 
poetry reveals, and in a quite real sense, creates 
them. . . . This it does by virtue of imagina- 
tion, by the potency of the shaping spirit." 
Clearly, Mr. Mackail's definition is not to be 
frowned upon ; properly interpreted and elabo- 
rated, it would be both sound and fruitful. But 
unfortunately the author of the not unilluminat- 
ing " Springs of Helicon " has descended to a 
type of criticism that one is tempted to call 
jugglery. By what intellectual and emotional 
processes he reached his conclusions it would be 
difficult to say they scarcely appear in these 
essays. Ordinarily he treats his ideas as pretty 
toys, to be displayed with a childish triumph of 
ownership. His " function of life " and " pat- 
tern of life " he repeats till one is distraught. 
Arnold, it is true, had the vice of inordinate

repetition of phrase, but with a difference : when 
one objects to Arnold's repetitions, a technical 
matter of style is involved ; when one winces at 
Mr. Mackail's repetitions, it is because so little 
seems to lie behind them. The sense of won- 
der and religious elevation that poetry surely 
evokes in Mr. Mackail becomes, in his criticism, 
too often an uninspired trifling with incalculably 
great things. Is it possible that so staunch a 
follower of Rossetti and Swinburne, braced with 
the robust All's-well doctrines of Browning, is 
on the verge of a disillusionment? Or is it 
simply a matter of lapsing into impotence? 

It may be that Mr. Mackail's scientific inter- 
ests are at the root of this trifling and ineffec- 
tualness. Everything, he says somewhere, is in 
a state of flux. The notion of a hostility be- 
tween science and poetry is baseless; and then 
he re-defines poetry as " the projection on a 
visible plane of a vast and exceedingly complex 
mass of poetical tendencies and potentialities." 
One of his lectures, "The Progress of Poetry," 
is a deliberate application of evolutionary ideas 
to poetry; the title is suggested by Gray, the 
lecture itself by Darwinian science. The prog- 
ress of poetry is not necessarily one toward per- 
fection ; like " all other vital functions " poetry 
must have movement, and, like history, never 
repeats itself. We may study the movements of 
the past, as the historian does, but can say noth- 
ing of the future. Incidentally, Mr. Mackail 
points to the exuberance of minor poetry as an 
instance of " the enormous wastefulness of Na- 
ture," uses in combination such terms as demand 
and supply, and shows an ominous familiarity 
with " the most recent physical doctrine," a 
treatise by Sir Oliver Lodge on the Ether of 
Space. As a consequence, it may be, of this 
influence, his style sinks at times to what Carlyle 
would surely have called a base lingo : 

" Poetry, like life, is always beginning afresh. In 
all the embodiments of itself through which it passes it 
is mixed with matter. To that matter it gives life; by 
its incorporation in that matter it makes its own life 
visible and sensible. But the matter tends to encroach 
upon the vital spirit which informs it; poetry becomes 
encumbered by its own creations. It has to shake itself 
free from them, volatilise for a new condensation." 

This, then, is the style and habit of thought that 
proceeds from the combination of Coleridgean 
wonder with scientific study; or, to adopt Mr. 
Mackail's manner of language, this is the seed 
that results from the fertilization of the pistillate 
flower of modern romanticism by the pollen of 
evolutionary science. 

One is compelled to admit, on completing a 
reading of Mr. Mackail's latest work, as Mr. 



John Bailey reluctantly admitted of the lecture 
placed last in the volume, that " there is not, 
to tell the truth, a very great deal in it." Yet 
certain and not slight reservations must be made. 
The discussion of Arabian poetry is in many 
respects excellent ; the lecture on Shakespeare's 
sonnets is eminently worth while, rebuking as 
it does the assertions of those who find in the 
sonnets a history of Shakespeare's life and those 
who label them ingenious literary exercises. 
Still more worth while is the lecture on Virgil 
and Virgilianism, which is at the same time en- 
tirely readable and scholarly, and which presents 
a very acceptable solution to the problem of the 
Culex. And indeed throughout the volume one 
will come upon passages in which erudition is 
blended refreshingly with literary felicity and 
that tone of urbanity which Arnold may almost 
be said to have introduced into English literary 
criticism. These things one will find in Mr. 
Mackail's latest volume, and they are not to be 
set aside lightly, however deficient that volume 
may be in the higher qualities of criticism. 

Mr. John Bailey's book is a collection of re- 
views reprinted from the literary supplement of 
the London " Times," twenty-two reviews, on 
subjects ranging from Chaucer to Meredith, in 
a volume of only two hundred pages. In the 
nature of the case the result is somewhat frag- 
mentary ; but Mr. Bailey brings to his task a 
responsive gusto and a degree of thoughtfulness, 
together with a conciseness of expression, that 
go far to make the book not only readable but 
profitable. For him poetry is a radiance of light 
illuminating all existence; and criticism is 
another kind of radiance of light, the purpose 
of which is to illuminate poetry. Whatever one 
may think of this view of criticism, one must at 
least grant that Mr. Bailey frequently accom- 
plishes his purpose. He " surrenders " himself 
to use his own word to wellnigh every poet 
that he discusses, acts the spy diligently, and 
reports in terse language what he has learned. 
He has the same charity for Shelley as for Dr. 
Johnson, yet without the open-mouthed and 
often empty-mouthed admiration of not a few 
modern critics. In the course of his sympa- 
thetic and thoughtful chatting, he says many 
good things, condenses aptly impressions that 
we all had vaguely, and moves with ease as well 
as reverence in the domains of high poetry. 
That he is always sound is not to be expected ; 
in his judgment Wordsworth and Pater are both 
true Platonists, despite their predilection for 
revery and for intuition not based on reason, 
and Wordsworth (whose lesser half was Rous- 



230 



THE DIAL 



[Man-h 16, 



seaii) is " less like Rousseau than any man who 
ever lived." In general, however, Mr. Hailey's 
clear and sober thinking and really large fund 
of information enable him to spend his sympathy 
with discretion. The following, from " Scott's 
Poetry," is typical: 

" It is a poetry that uses its eyes but not its mind. 
It asks no questions and belongs very emphatically to 
the age before responsibility for the universe was in- 
vented. It is an external poetry, enjoying its own mo- 
tion, dancing with youth and joy in the open air and 
the animal pleasure of being alive. Obviously it loses 
much by being only that; but after all it is fair to re- 
member how much it gains by being that. Here is a 
poetry which is not doggerel, and which yet sticks in 
the memory of a schoolboy, a boatman, or a private of 
the Guards, as nothing else but doggerel would. Here 
is the language of a scholar and a gentleman, the eye of 
a poet, the ear of no mean master of the art of metre, 
and the result is what a soldier can march to and a 
child understand. That is no mean achievement; it is 
what no one since Scott has achieved." 

But no sooner does the author get under way, 
than he must turn to another phase of his sub- 
ject, with a journalistic " There is one other 
thing" that disappoints while it stimulates.

SOME NEW STUDIES OF NAPOLEON.* 

The remark is often made, with every appear- 
ance of conviction, that in history general con- 
ditions of society or processes of change are 
more significant than the deeds of individual 
men, however great their genius. But the mat- 
ter would evidently be decided the other way on 
a referendum. Biography is still the historical 
" best seller." There is no break in the suc- 
cession of studies of that most notable of all 
modern geniuses, Napoleon. Indeed, with the 
new year began the publication in Paris of an 
important historical review having his career 
and his influence upon the nineteenth century 
as the principal theme, and bearing the title 
Revue des Etudes Napoleoniennea. 

It seems singular that we should have two 
translations of Fournier's Life of Napoleon.

The explanation is that Professor Fournier pub- 
lished his first edition about twenty years ago, 
and a translation was undertaken by the late 
Professor E. G. Bourne. The work was <lr 
la\v<l, and appeared finally only a few month* 
before Fournier began to publish a revised edi- 
tion. Changes in this revised edition, completed 
in 1906, and including new matter amount in^ 
to about a ninth of the whole, have given ><;, 
sion for a second translation, issued in two 
volumes, instead of one as before. The student 
of Napoleonic affairs would welcome thi> tran>- 
lation unreservedly had not the translator taken 
unexplained liberties, omitting or abridging 
many of Fournier's notes and venturing in a few 
instances to alter statements of the text. 

Professor Fournier is regarded as one of the 
most authoritative writers on the Napoleonic 
period. As Rose has drawn especially from the 
papers in the British Record Office, and Sorel 
from the French archives, so Fournier has made 
a large use of the archives at Vienna. His work 
is distinguished by a commendable absence of 
rhetoric, and by definiteness in statements of 
fact. From his treatment it is easy to grasp 
the distinction between the French empire and 
that " Grand Empire" which came into existence 
after Austerlitz. As might be expected of an 
Austrian, he gives a more sympathetic and intel- 
ligible presentation of Austrian diplomacy in the 
critical months from December 1812 to April 
1814. He does not credit Metternich with that 
Machiavellian shrewdness which Metternich was 
not averse to ascribing to himself, and which 
hostile critics have unhesitatingly asriiU-d to 
him. Fournier believes that Metternich's policy 
was dictated by the perception of Austria's weak- 
ness, by a desire to recover territories of which 
Napoleon had despoiled her, and by fears that 
if he demanded too much all would be lost or 
rival states would gain undue advantages. 

Fournier gives little space to subtle analyses 
of Napoleon's character. The reader is left to 
make his own generalizations. Occasionally, 
however, the author states frankly his concep- 
tion of the man and his significance. Writing 
of Napoleon's warlike policy in 1802, he says 
that had Napoleon been a Frenchman In- would 
have rested content to see France play a leading 
part among the powers of Europe ; but neither 
his patriotism nor his ambition were French. 
Corsica had disowned him, and henceforth his 
ambition lacked the wholesome restraint of na- 
tional boundaries, and had become a thing at 
once gigantic, embracing the whole world in its 
sweep, and infinitely paltry the selfish greed

of an individual." But Professor Fournier be- 
lieves that while striving apparently to carry out 
his own purposes Napoleon derived his real force 
from being an unconscious instrument of " that 
civilization of humanity at which the intellectual 
forces had been laboring for centuries," and 
which was introducing a higher social order. 

Mr. Arthur Hassall also treats Napoleon's 
whole career, but in a summary fashion. He 
has attempted to solve the baffling problem of 
explaining the principal facts of his biography 
in seventy-five thousand words. This demands, 
above all, definiteness and brevity of statement. 
Mr. Hassall has the fault of alluding to facts 
rather than stating them. He is repetitious, 
and interjects irrelevant reflections. The con- 
sequences of the battle of Austerlitz are stated 
in substantially the same language four times 
within eleven pages. This is not a typical case, 
but it shows that the task of organizing the 
material within narrow compass has not been 
accomplished. 

The books of Masson and Espitalier treat 
special events or phases of Napoleon's career : 
the first, the reasons for and manner of his 
coronation ; the second, his relations with Murat 
from 1808 to 1814. What Fournier sums up 
in eighteen lines, Espitalier explains in five 
hundred pages. Fournier gives a page and a 
half to Masson's subject. This does not imply 
that either Espitalier or Masson have wasted 
space by descending into unnecessary details ; 
it illustrates the fact that even a two or three 
volume biography of Napoleon must leave many 
interesting features of his career almost un- 
touched. 

The interest of M. Masson's book is derived 
from the minuteness of his information in re- 
gard to all the details of Napoleon's coronation 
and the careful preparations for it. His opinion 
as to whether Napoleon gained or lost by the 
transaction is of secondary importance, because 
this matter has been discussed many times ; but 
the preparations for the coronation have never 
found so painstaking a chronicler. The prob- 
lems connected with the ceremony were so intri- 
cate that four different editions were prepared 
of the " Extract from the Ceremonial Relating 
to the Consecration of their Imperial Majesties." 
The forms chosen were selected in part from the 
old French ceremonial aud the Roman service- 
book. To these were added new prayers and 
some ceremonies unknown to either Reims or 
Rome. All questions of ceremonial were gone 
over with the Pope before the day of corona- 
tion. Contrary to the traditional story, which 



Fournier repeats in a mild form, it was ex- 
pressly provided in the official order of service 
that the Emperor "will ascend to the altar, take 
the crown, place it on his head, and, taking that 
of the Empress in his hands, will crown her." 
At every stage of the preparations, says M. 
Masson, Napoleon took an intense interest, and 
" refined and added r and demanded more pomp, 
pageantry, and actors." The cost of the whole 
was about twenty million francs. In an ap- 
pendix are the official descriptions of the cos- 
tumes with itemized statements of expense. One 
thing M. Masson does not venture to explain 
the reasons which moved Napoleon to crown 
Josephine, contrary to the precedents of four 
centuries, during which only one French queen, 
Marie de Medici, had been crowned. Why 
should he flout public opinion by calling such 
attention to a woman whose history could not 
adorn pinnacles of glory ? " Why ? . Doubtless 
because he had no sense of humor. He calmly 
did what no Parisian, no European, would have 
dared. It was enough that the woman was 
pleasing to him, and that he had chosen her." 
While M. Espitalier gives an account of 
Murat's relations to Napoleon from the time 
Napoleon made him king of Naples, the theme of 
the volume is the defection of Murat completed 
by the treaty of January 11, 1814. All the 
way through, M. Espitalier's work is based on 
a careful study of the documents. Through 
the researches of Commandant Weil, a mass of 
material on Murat has been recently published ; 
but M. Espitalier has supplemented this by his 
own researches. In the earlier chapters he seems 
to display towards Murat a captious spirit, find- 
ing it strange that he desired to be a real mon- 
arch and was not content to remain a faithful 
viceroy of Napoleon. Some things may be 
alleged in excuse of this innkeeper's son, the 
most glorious cavalier among all Napoleon's 
generals. Since his marriage to Caroline Bona- 
parte in 1800 he had been trained in a school of 
parvenus, and naturally concluded that he had 
a claim to share in the prodigious fortunes of 
the family. What wonder that patience and 
modesty were not among his merits? M. Espi- 
talier says, however, that it was a traitress, rather 
than a traitor, who was responsible for the Janu- 
ary treaty, and that this person was Caroline 
Bonaparte. The defeat at Leipsic, which he 
had witnessed, caused Murat to listen to over- 
tures from Metternich ; but Caroline did not 
wait for news from that fatal field before she 
concluded to open negotiations with Austria. 
The event showed that Murat was not content

with the guarantee of his crown which M.-tt. -r- 
nich was ready to give, and that he hoped to 
force Austria to give him at least all Italy south 
of the Po. The way he played his game, trying 
to hoodwink both the Austrians and Napoleon, 
was shameless; but the reason for it was the 
weakness of his position quite as much as the 
crookedness of his character. To attempt to 
force the hand of a power of the first class, when 
he had an army of less than thirty thousand, was 
sheer folly. Metternich easily outmano3uvred 
him, and the result was the treaty in which his 
treachery to his brother-in-law stood revealed. 
The terms of the treaty were a bitter disappoint- 
ment, for he was promised only territory suffi- 
cient to add four hundred thousand subjects. 

Another Napoleonic volume, edited by Mr. 
M acKenzie Mac Bride, includes papers on Water- 
loo and on the Peninsular campaigns. One of 
the diaries also gives an account of English 
campaigning in Egypt in 1799. The miscel- 
laneous character of the collection is shown by 
the inclusion of Sergeant Dickson's account of 
the charge of the Scots Greys, told forty years 
afterwards over the cups at a coffee-house. 
The diaries of Sergeant Nicol and of Sergeant 
Robertson are more interesting, and portray life 
in the army from the point of view of the soldier. 
The editor of the volume takes the complacent 
British view that Napoleon's successes are to be 
accounted for by the fact that neither he nor 
his officers were pitted against British generals 
until the Peninsular and Waterloo campaigns. 
Napoleon's " conventional methods of warfare 
were good enough for the Russian peasants or 
the Portuguese and Spaniards."

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



Thewrgeon crea tion of sound public opinion 

and MI place in on many important social phases of 
modern tocietv. tnfc surgical profession is the under- 
lying motive of Dr. C. W. Saleeby's latest work, 
" Surgery and Society: A Tribute to Listerism" 
(Moffat/Yard & Co.). The author is abundantly 
qualified to deal with this subject because of his 
own medical training and experience. He wields 
a facile and wonted pen in his presentation of the 
state of surgical practice it can scarcely be desig- 
nated science prior to the discovery of anaesthesia 
and of antiseptic as well as aseptic surgery. Against 
this foil of horror, pain, gangrene, and frightful 
mortality in military and maternity hospitals, the 
epoch-making achievements of Lord Lister are por* 
trayed in their true relation. Incidentally the anti- 
vivisectionist is revealed in the role of obstructor of 



medical and social progress. High tribute is paid to 
the noble and merciful ideal which inspires this 
propaganda, but the reader will not be blinded to 
tin- scientific and social consequences which How 
from thi.s idealistic- but misdirected zeal for tin- im- 
mediate welfare of a few of the countless animals 
which man turns to higher uses. The relation of 
alcohol and alcoholism to surgery, the obstacles it 
raises to ami'thtnia, the reduction in powers of 
resistance to germs and of recuperative capacity 
attendant upon the u*e of this what the author 
calls a protoplasmic poison, are set forth in no 
equivocal terms. The present status of the surgeon 
in society as related to the general practitioner, to 
the hospital, to the charity clinic, to the wealthy 
client, and to the less fortunate patient of moderate 
means who does not deign to accept charity and can 
ill afford a year's income as a fee, is fully di-cu-M-d. 
and a solution of the social and professional prob- 
lems which these relationships create our sanguine 
author foresees in the growing socialization of the 
surgeon's profession. The freer use of the hospital 
by all classes, especially under the encouragement 
of the Government Insurance Act, and the prompter 
resort to the knife as a means of prevention of dis- 
ease and social deterioration, portend a wider and 
more effective service for this noble profession, un- 
less perchance the future growth of Listerism in 
other words, of our control of disease germs by pre- 
ventive methods shall rob even the surgeon's 
knife of its task. 

Mtmorie* and ** the first of a trilo gy entitled " Hail 
mm ing i of an and Farewell," Mr. George Moore's 
irith author. Ave" makes its appearance with a 
prefatory note by the publishers of the American 
edition (Apple ton) explaining that the Knglish re- 
viewers of the book have done it an injustice in 
treating it as a mere volume of reminiscences. The 
author, we are assured, " has rather tried to pro- 
duce something quite different. His intentions were 
to take a certain amount of material and to model it 
just as he would do in a novel. The people in his 
book are not personalities; they are types of human 
characters. Edward Marty n, for instance, is, in Mr. 
Moore's own words, 'as typical of Ireland as Sancho 
Panza is of Spain. . . . Yeats is not only the man 
who has gone to America to explain the Abbey 
Theatre to the American people; he is the typical 
literary fop. Gill as he appears in the first volume 
represents the posthumous intelligence or should I 
say the disembodied intelligence which Catholic super- 
stitions create.' A philosophy is indicated between 
the lines if the interviewer cares to read between the 
lines. This philosophy will transpire in the volume 
entitled 'Salve' which is to follow." The final 
volume of this autobiographic-philosophic trilogy is 
to be called " Vale." There is much curious observa- 
tion and reflection in the work, and excellent charac- 
ter-painting occurs in abundance. Mr. Moore's 
readers do not need to be told that hia peculiarities 
of style, his conceptions of literary art, give their 



1912.]

unmistakable character to these pages. Occasional 
details that one need not be unduly squeamish to 
regard as unornamental and inartistic are rendered 
with frank distinctness. Probably the book will for 
this reason appeal to many with all the more force, 
while others will inevitably be repelled. At any 
rate, it is not a commonplace production, even though 
it does incidentally treat of some commonplace things. 
Others that are not commonplace are there in plenty. 



A great poetry of ruins, especially in the 

architectural ruins of ancient Rome, is something 
etcher. now so universally conceded that 

probably few persons realize how really modern is 
this attitude of mind ; still fewer realize how much 
it is due to the insight of one man Giovanni 
Battista Piranesi. For centuries, the debris of an- 
tique art in Italy had lain half submerged, dismissed 
from the care of men and abolished from their recol- 
lections. In company with Winckelmann, it was 
Piranesi who helped to drag them, as it were, to 
the light once more ; and he lent his etcher's needle 
to bring about an extension of the knowledge of the 
beautiful to that heritage of art which the world 
owned but had overlooked. People awoke, recog- 
nized, admired, and wondered how blind they and 
their forefathers had been, and proceeded to redis- 
cover architecture in Italy. A century and a half 
has passed since his best work appeared, and Mr. 
Arthur Samuel, in a book called "Piranesi " (Scrib- 
ner), justly considers that the time is ripe to redis- 
cover this neglected artist and to give him the credit 
that he really deserves. In that category, he places 
not only his influence on the art of etching, but also 
on archaeology, on the architecture and decoration 
associated with the names of the brothers Adam, and 
on the furniture designs of Chippendale, Sheraton, 
and their successors. Piranesi was one of those for- 
tunate men who have appeared at the juncture when 
their skill and individuality afford the greatest serv- 
ice. Architectural etching culminated with him. 
His successors are all able to reproduce more or less 
of his characteristics, but up to the present they 
have suggested no improvement or further develop- 
ment of the art as he left it. In English furniture, 
many splendid examples now called by various other 
names might be classed more truly as " Piranesi 
furniture." It was the admiration inspired by the 
publication of his Roman etchings that checked the 
tendency among English furniture-makers to slip 
away towards the rococo. The points to be noted 
in what may be called a piece of " Piranesi furni- 
ture " are as follows : a noble simplicity of outline, 
but treated in such a way as to be entirely English 
in character; carved mouldings similar to those on 
classic stone work ; a suggestion of Renaissance feel- 
ing or inspiration lending lightness, color, and sali- 
ency to the whole, in places where a piece made 
from Chippendale's designs would be found heavy, 
dull, and uninteresting. The man Piranesi is shown 
in Mr. Samuel's pages to be quite as interesting as 
the artist, recalling Benvenuto Cellini in his fiery 



and impetuous character. The etchings, of which 
twenty-five double-page plates serve as illustrations, 
do not lose in charm as much as one would expect 
from their great reduction in size, and the volume 
as a whole is one to justify the biographer's claim 
that Piranesi is of the utmost value to the architect 
of to-day, and particularly to the student of the 
early Renaissance. 

The author of " Sherman's March to 
war. th * Sea," Major Samuel H. M. Byers, 

presents some of his war-time memo- 
ries in a brisk and at times thrilling narrative to 
which, without explanation or apology, he has given 
the title of the popular Sienkiewicz romance, " With 
Fire and Sword." But, under whatever name, the 
book is well able to stand on its own merits. The 
author's eagerness for military adventure in those 
youthful days when volunteers were called for to 
defend the Union, his determination to be in the 
thick of every fight even though his duties as quar- 
termaster sergeant compelled him to provide a substi- 
tute to perform those duties whenever the prospect 
of a battle lured him to the front, the fifteen months 
of awful prison life and of repeated attempts to es- 
cape, the circumstances attending his writing of his 
famous war ballad in prison, and his final recovery 
of freedom by a bold and artful stratagem these 
and many other matters go to make up one of the 
best accounts of army experience that the Civil War 
has been instrumental in giving to the reading pub- 
lic. Major Byers gained the reward of his gallantry 
when Sherman made him a member of his staff and 
selected him to carry to Grant the first official re- 
port of the successful " march to the sea." It was 
as a corporal in Company B of the Fifth Iowa Infan- 
try that the young patriot entered his country's serv- 
ice in 1861, and he saw some hot fighting under 
Grant in those early years of the war, being finally 
taken prisoner at Chattanooga and suffering the hard- 
ships of confinement in Libby Prison and afterward 
at Columbia, S.C. His regiment almost fought itself 
out of existence, being reduced by the fortunes of 
war from one thousand men to two hundred and 
twenty-three. These figures will show that the 
author's pages have no lack of stirring incidents and 
exciting scenes. A portrait of General Sherman 
and one of Major Byers illustrate the book. (Neale

The earlier Few save specialists realize that for 
history of the writing of the history of the 

California. Pacific coast there exists a mass of 
material quite comparable with that from which the 
history of the Atlantic coast has been so volumi- 
nously and so minutely written. Workers within the 
field have been few, and the widely scattered and in 
some measure inaccessible sources of information 
have only begun to be exploited. A good many 
years ago Mr. Hubert Howe Bancroft brought to- 
gether a collection of upwards of one hundred and 
fifty volumes of documents pertaining to the history 
of the Far West in general. But even this remark-

able body of material, now the property of the Uni- 
versity of California, is at no point exhaustive, and 
it remains for the student of virtually any aspect of 
Pacific coast history to delve in the archives of Ma- 
drid, Seville, and Mexico City (not to mention the 
Library of Congress and other American reposi- 
tories), if he would compass the limits of his subject. 
A volume which is the fruit of thoroughgoing re- 
search of this character is " California under Spain 
and Mexico, 1535-1847" (Houghton), by .Mr. 
Irving B. Richman. Beginning with the explora- 
tion of Alta (or Upper) California by Juan Rodri- 
guez Cabrillo in 1542-43, Mr. Richman describes 
in detail the opening of California by the Spaniards, 
the establishment of the missions, the planting of 
political and social institutions, the growth of inter- 
national rivalries, the movement for Calif ornian inde- 
pendence, the Pacific coast phases of the war between 
the United States and Mexico, and the circumstances 
lying back of the acquisition of California by the 
United States. The book has been written almost en- 
tirely from manuscript sources, and the earlier por- 
tions of it largely from materials hitherto unused. 
The work has been done in a painstaking manner, 
and the product must be adjudged distinctly credit- 
able to American historical scholarship. The text, 
besides being fortified by a hundred and fifty pages 
of closely-printed critical notes, is illuminated by a 
score of maps and charts, several of them never here- 
tofore reproduced. It is of interest to note that 
with respect to the ranch disputed question of Cap- 
tain John C. Fremont's complicity in the so-called 
Bear Flag revolt of June, 1846, Mr. Richman holds 
not merely, as do most writers, that the young engi- 
neer assisted in instigating the movement, but also 
that in doing so he was, as substantiated both by 
documents and by his own subsequent admission, 
deliberately disregarding the instructions of the 
Government. 



A pragmatic 
outlook. 



So much has philosophy been popu- 
larized by its treatment at the hands 
of the late Professor James that peo- 
ple who would never have thought of asking the old 
Pilatean question, " What is truth ? " may now be 
heard every day asking, " What is pragmatism ? " 
While pragmatism is, at the very least, two things 
a method in philosophy and a view of reality, 
and as one philosophic writer has claimed to identify 
thirteen different " pragmatisms," a reply to the 
question might seem rather hopeless. It will not be 
hopeless, however, if the inquirers will refer to Pro- 
fessor David Starr Jordan's little book, "The Sta- 
bility of Truth : A Discussion of Reality as Related 
to Thought and Action " (Holt). Dr. Jordan takes 
an eminently sane view of the world in which we 
live, and he presents that view with dignity and 
with a simplicity that will give him the largest pos- 
sible audience for a book of serious character. " The 
purpose of this book," says its author, "is to set 
forth the doctrine that the final test of truth is found 
in trusting our lives to it. Truth is livable while 



error is not, and the difference appears through the 
strain of the conduct of life. . . . Science . . . 
cannot grasp any truth in final or absolute complete- 
ness. But science may grasp certain relations of 
truth and certain phases of reality, and may state 
these in terms of previous human experience. Such 
versions or transcripts of reality are truth, and they 
represent actual verity as far as they go." One of 
the most interesting chapters in the book from a 
philosophic standpoint is that wherein Dr. Jordan 
shows that Monism, despite its loudly colored scien- 
tific garb, is nothing but poetry after all, and (one 
might add) rather indifferent poetry at that. Of 
lighter interest is the chapter on "Reality and Illu- 
-inn. " in which Dr. Jordan displays a comprehensive 
knowledge of all the illusions and delusions of this 
mad world, from clairvoyant methods of silver- 
mining to astral Atlantic transit of thoughts and 
bodies. The reader will lay down this book with 
admiration of its author's catholicity of spirit and 
(it is to be hoped) with agreement that " the life of 
action verifies and validates the world of realities," 
a declaration that is the gist of the pragmatic 
philosophy. 

M.Emile Faguet's latest volume bears 
** g*g in g title of -The Cult of 
Incompetence" (Dutton). Coming 
from a member of the French Academy, it has ex- 
erted a rather wide influence upon the philosophic- 
ally minded of French politicians. Transferred to 
English, the treatment carries with it too strongly 
the oratorical flavor, and too constantly the attempt 
at clever expression. Viewed intimately the essay 
is concerned with the psychology of democracy ; its 
basal position regards as inherent in the democratic 
expression the desire tliat its rulers be of the people 
and like the people, and for this end sacrifices all 
other benefits. The inevitable consequence of the 
resulting political government is incompetence, since 
the people having no competence for government 
yet democratically insist upon control of administra- 
tion, of the judiciary, and of legislation. All this 
is traced back to a marked psychological trait of 
democracy that declines to recognize superiority of 
capacity or of any other type, and finds in treating 
as equal what really is not equal the satisfaction of 
personal self-assertion. M. Faguet treats this theme 
with more direct reference to philosophy and his- 
tory than would be the case in the hands of an 
equally independent American thinker. The same 
radical question of the compatibility of democracy 
with efficiency is engaging serious students in France 
as in America; both point to the strong contrast be- 
tween the efficiency of private corporations and the 
incompetence of political rule. The value of the 
book lies in taking the issue away from the political 
platform and back to the fundamental position of 
the philosophy and psychology of the political atti- 
tude, for this is the view that must ultimately pre- 
vail. Like the admirable analysis of Mr. Graham 
Wallas in his " Human Nature in Politics," this ap-

engrossing narrative from the pen of Mr. Carl 
Hovey. "The Life Story of J. Pierpont Morgan" 
(Sturgis & Walton Co.) follows in some detail the 
rise of Mr. Morgan from his first inconspicuous 
place in his father's banking house to undisputed 
leadership in the world of finance. The personal 
and private aspect of the man barely appears, though 
the final chapter does attempt to present "the man 
himself" apart from his business interests. Full 
and interesting are the accounts of his achieve- 
ments in building up and consolidating railroad 
systems, in financing the United States Steel Corpo- 
ration, and in other large operations. In describ- 
ing the underwriting of the immense steel corpora- 
tion, the author rather puzzles one with some of his 
details. He makes eight thousand dollars to be 
twelve and one-half per cent of one hundred thou- 
sand once explicitly, and twice by implication. 
But slips of this sort will show him to belong rather 
to the world of letters than to Wall Street and the 
world of finance, and thus may inspire greater con- 
fidence in his book as written impartially and from 
a sufficient distance to gain the proper perspective. 
In fact, he himself declares at the outset: "As for 
the book, let it be said at once that it was con- 
ceived and written independently by the author; 
there was never the least influence or dictation from 
without. The material was gathered because the 
subject was interesting and the opportunities lay 
close at hand." The portraits and other illustra- 
tions that embellish the text are appropriate and 
good, and the print is unusually clear and free from 
errors.

engaged in carrying supplies to the Midway Islands, 
where the enlarging of a channel leading into the 
harbor was in progress. It was on her home voyage 
that the vessel, going out of her way to pick up any 
chance victims of shipwreck on Ocean Island, was 
herself wrecked on an outlying reef of that island. 
Luckily no lives were lost, but for nearly six months 
the ship's company had a grim fight for existence 



on that low-lying spot of sandy desolation. How 
they economized their resources and eked out their 
rations with seal and albatross, how they tinkered 
up a condenser for supplying them with fresh water 
when rains were infrequent, how four of the men 
set out in the captain's gig for the Sandwich Islands 
a thousand miles away to summon aid, and how only 
one reached his destination alive all this and much 
else is crammed into the terse diary account of the 
paymaster of the ill-fated vessel. Illustrations from

The bane of our present-day investi- 
A neglected . ,-, 31 

literary type. gation in the modern languages, it has 

been charged, is its mediaevalism. 
Nevertheless, it is safe to predict that the Middle 
Ages will continue to furnish much of the materials 
for our doctors' theses for some time to come ; the 
field affords specific problems, and it has by no 
means been exhausted as yet. Among the neglected 
problems belonging peculiarly to this field is that 
of the history and influence of the so-called political 
prophecy, a species of prophecy literary in form, 
but written, either ostensibly or actually, for political 
purposes. A painstaking study of this genre from 
the point of view of the British versions has recently 
been made by Dr. Rupert Taylor in his volume 
entitled "The Political Prophecy in England" 
(Columbia University Press). The author shows 
that the political prophecy first flourished in En- 
gland in the twelfth century, having been introduced 
by Geoffrey of Monmouth, and that it attained its 
greatest vogue in the thirteenth and fourteenth cen- 
turies. In the fifteenth century it fell into disfavor, 
and in Shakespeare's time it came to be a favorite 
subject of burlesque. The species had become ex- 
tinct in Great Britain by the end of the seventeenth 
century. In the earlier versions the leading role is 
taken by the wizard Merlin ; and in the later versions 
Thomas a Becket plays a prominent part. The type 
appears to have enjoyed a wide popularity, and ex- 
ercised at one time, so Mr. Taylor thinks, consider- 
able influence on political events. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

The " Home University Library " of Messrs. Henry 
Holt & Co. is now extended, by the publication of sev- 
eral new issues, to about thirty volumes. The excellence 
of these little books, together with their low price, should 
bring them into many homes, to say nothing of the schools 
for whose purposes they are singularly well adapted. 
The most attractive of the new lot of titles are Mr. G. H. 
Mair's "English Literature," Professor Giles's "Civili- 
zation of China," Dr. William Barry's " The Papacy and 
Modern Times," and Professor Frederic L. Paxson's 
"The Civil War." 

We have received several new volumes of " The Com- 
plete Works of Friedrich Nietzsche," issued, under the 
editorial charge of Dr. Oscar Levy, by the Macmillan Co. 
The volumes now at hand include "Early Greek Phi- 
losophy and Other Essays," translated by Mr. Maxi-

milian A. Miigge; the second part of Human All-Too- 
Human," translated by Mr. Paul V. Cohn ; " The Case of 
Wagner," to which the posthumous " We Philologists " 
is appended, translated by Mr. A. M. Ludovici and Mr. 
J. M. Kennedy; " The Dawn of Day," translated l.\ 
Mr. J. M. Kennedy; and "The Twilight of the Idols," 
translated by Mr. A. M. Ludovici. These volumes are 
numbered, respectively, two, seven, eight, nine, and 
sixteen. Eighteen volumes are to be included in the 
complete set. 

One is almost tempted to say that we get the most 
thorough studies of men and periods in English liter- 
ature from the group of younger French scholars who 
have made our literature their chosen field of research. 
Dr. Floris Delattre is the latest of this company to make 
us his debtor, and his " Robert Herrick " (Paris: Alcan) 
is a monograph which for solid scholarship and sympa- 
thetic appreciation could not readily be matched by a 
work of English origin upon the subject. As a by- 
product of his labors in connection with Herrick, M. 
Delattre has also given us (in English) a treatise on 
" English Fairy Poetry from the Origins to the Seven- 
teenth Century " (Frowde) an interesting study of a 
fascinating subject, for which he has placed students of 
our literature deeply in his debt. 

The " Viking Edition " of Ibsen, now published in 
handsome library form by the Messrs. Scribner, extends 
to thirteen volumes. The popular edition, as edited by 
Mr. William Archer, is here reproduced as to text, with 
the accessories of improved typography, fine paper, a 
dignified binding, and upwards of forty illustrations. 
The translations are the familiar ones fathered by Mr. 
Archer, excepting "Love's Comedy" and "Brand," 
which are given us (as before) in the remarkable poet- 
ical versions of Professor C. H. Herford. Eleven vol- 
umes of this edition contain the twenty-one dramatic 
works; the twelfth gives us the supplementary volume 
entitled " From Ibsen's Workshop"; the thirteenth repro- 
duces Mr. Gosse's biography. 

Books for Boys and Girls " is the title of a handy 
list of more than fifteen hundred carefully selected works 
for older children, issued in pamphlet form by the New- 
ark (N. J.) Free Public Library. Of course some re- 
striction has been imposed by the limit of the Newark 
Library's resources, the selection being from books on its 
shelves. It is a useful and a well-printed little booklet. 
" Popular Books for Boys and Girls " is the title of a 
somewhat similar list prepared by Miss Carrie E. Scott, 
assistant organizer, Public Library Commission of Indi- 
ana, and published by the Commission. The titles are 
grouped according to school-grades, from one to eight, 
the first two grades forming one class; and about one 
hundred and fifty juvenile favorites, both in fiction and 
of a more instructive character, are listed. 

A series of little books on " Famous Operas " is pub- 
lished by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. Each volume has 
a historical introduction (including a synopsis of the 
plot) followed by the text in both the original language 
and English translation. The three volumes now at 
hand are devoted to " Aida," " Carmen," and " Tristan 
und Isolde," and are all edited by Mr. W. J. Henderson. 
We are not told who is responsible for the translations 
offered, but we recommend them to the attention of the 
misguided people who think that these works should 
be sung in English, and who airily dismiss the objection 
that translations adequate for the purpose are practically 
impossible to make. A volume of "Opera Synopses," 
prepared by Mr. J. Walker McSpadden, is published by 



the Crowell Co., and will be found useful for reference. 
The guide to " Konigskinder," )>y Messrs. Isaacs and 
Kahlson, published by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co., is a 
synopsis of Humperdinck's beautiful work, with thematic 
illustrations and pictures. Finally, we may mention 
two pamphlets on "The Magic Flute." by Mr. Kilward 
J. Dent, one of them a history and interpretation " of 
the opera, the other an English translation. These book- 
lets are from Messrs. W. Ileffer & Sons, Cambridge, 
England. 

Lovers of folk-lore will welcome the volume of " Myths 
and Legends of Alaska" (McClurg), compiled and edited 
by Miss Katharine Benson Judson. This is a collection 
of some three score of the commonest folk-tales current 
among the Alaskan Indians. The raven is tin- chief 
figure in these legends. It was at the command of Raven 
that the world came into being, that man was created, 
that the Hood was sent upon the earth, and it was through 
his agency that fire was brought down from heaven and 
that the tides were made to ebb and How. Other animals 
that figure prominently are the porcupine, the beaver, 
the walrus, and the whale. Miss Benson has reproduced 
these tales in a simple, terse English, approximating as 
nearly as possible the style of the natives; at the same 
time, she has taken no liberties with the matter of her 
originals. Upwards of fifty full-page illustrations, de- 
picting life and customs among the Alaskans, add to the 
attractiveness of the volume. 

The country parishes of England furnish attractive 
fields for the student of the lore and legend of the En- 
glish Church. Some of them possess a deeper interest 
and enjoy world-wide fame because of the incumbency 
therein, at one time or another in the last three centuries, 
of men who will always live in the world of Anglo- 
Saxon thought. It is of visits to several of these parishes 
that Mr. Ezra S. Tipple, of Drew Theological Seminary, 
writes in his book entitled " Some Famous Country Par- 
ishes" (Eaton & Mains). He gives us some delightful 
sketches of Hursley, Bemerton, Madeley, Kidderminster, 
Somersby, and Eversley; and of John Keble, George 
Herbert, John Fletcher, Richard Baxter, the Tennysons, 
and Charles Kingsley. The book is by no means ex- 
haustive of the parishes of England thus made famous. 
The selection was doubtless based upon individual pre- 
ferences; but it was a wise selection, and it presents the 
names of persons of whom we love to read. The illus- 
trations are from photographs by the author. 

The collection of " One Hundred Folk Songs of 
All Nations " which Mr. Granville Bantock has edited 
for the " Musician's Library " of the Messrs. Ditson, is 
one of the most attractive and valuable works now 
included in that admirable series. Mr. Bantock con- 
tributes no introductory essay, but gives us instead 
notes upon the hundred songs, and an extensive biblio- 
graphy of the literature of folk-music. Practically all 
countries and races are represented, each by from one 
to four examples, excepting Germany, which has eleven. 
The American examples are " Dixie," "Tenting on the 
Old Camp Ground," and " Old Folks at Home," be- 
sides two native pieces of Pawnee and Dakota origin. 
An important feature of this work is that with e\er\ 
song the original text is given (transliterated when 
necessary) together with an English translation. A 
Chinaman, an Arab, a Turk, or Finn might sing his 
national music directly from these pages. This is a 
veritable treasure-house of melodies familiar and un- 
familiar, for which we cannot be too grateful to the 
scholarly editorial work of Mr. Bantock. Two other

volumes now published in this collection are of a kind 
already well represented. One of them is Mr. Carl 
Armbruster's selection of " Thirty Songs by Franz 
Liszt"; the other is Mr. H. E. Krehbiel's selection of 
" Songs from the Operas for Baritone and Bass." 
The latter work represents twenty-three composers by 
twenty-seven numbers. The " Musician's Library " now 
numbers upwards of sixty volumes, and more than ful- 
fills the promise of its inception. 



NOTES. 



A collection of posthumous essays by the late Profes- 
sor Churton Collins is to be published shortly. Among 
the subjects are Shakespeare, Johnson, Burke, Word- 
sworth, Matthew Arnold, and Browning. 

It is announced that Mr. Hermann J. Warner is the 
author of " European Years : The Letters of an Idle 
Man," which was published anonymously last autumn 
by Houghton Mifflin Co., under the editorship of Mr. 
George E. Woodberry. 

Three books by Mr. John Galsworthy hold a promi- 
nent place in the spring publishing lists. Two of these 
are plays, "The Eldest Son" and "The Pigeon"; 
the other is a volume of poems, entitled " Wild Oats : 
Moods, Songs, and Doggerels." Messrs. Scribner will 
publish these books in America. 

Professor Rudolf Eucken of the University of Jena, 
whose most popular book, ft The Problem of Human 
Life," as translated by Professors Williston S. Hough 
and W. R. Boyce Gibson, has just been published in a 
new and cheaper edition by the Scribners, has been 
appointed Exchange Professor at Harvard for next 
autumn. 

The first number of a new architectural journal, en- 
titled " The Architectural Quarterly of Harvard Uni- 
versity," will be published this month. The purpose of 
the periodical is to present in easily accessible form 
important work by students, special lectures delivered 
in the school, and contributions by members of the 
teaching staff and graduates. 

Three lectures on Robert Louis Stevenson have just 
been given in London by Sir Sidney Colvin. The spe- 
cific subjects were : " R. L. S. : Personality and Per- 
sonal Writings "; "R. L. S.: Tales, Fantasies, and Ro- 
mances "; and " R. L. S.: Some Comparisons with Other 
Writers." It is to be hoped that these lectures will 
soon find their way into book form. 

Mrs. Hamilton King, author of " The Disciples," a 
poem dealing with Mazzini and the liberation and unity 
of Italy, is about to publish through Messrs. Longmans, 
Green & Co. a book entitled " Letters and Recollections 
of Mazzini." It is a personal record of the more inti- 
mate side of Mazzini's life during his later years, and 
contains some of his most characteristic letters. 

We learn that all preliminary arrangements have 
been made for a bibliography of the modern history of 
Great Britain which is to be compiled by the Committees 
of the Royal Historical Society and of the American 
Historical Association. The work, of which Professor 
G. W. Prothero is the general editor, will consist of 
three volumes, one general, one on the Tudor and Stuart 
periods, and one on the Hanoverian period. Some six- 
teen scholars on both sides of the Atlantic are at present 
engaged upon the selection of titles and data for the 
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. 



" The Macmillan Standard Library" is a series planned 
to provide at a nominal price well-made reprints of 
books in all fields of knowledge, published within the 
past few years, which have been accepted as authoritative 
contributions to their subjects, such books, for instance, 
as Professor Veblen's " Theory of the Leisure Class," 
Dr. Van Dyke's " The Spirit of America," Rev. R. J. 
Campbell's " The New Theology," Miss Jane Addams's 
" The Spirit of Youth and the City Streets," Professor 
L. A. Sherman's " What Is Shakespeare ? " etc. 

The first issue of a monthly " Index to Dates of Cur- 
rent Events " has just been issued by the R. R. Bowker 
Company of New York. This publication is the suc- 
cessor of two independent previous lists: the annual 
" Index to Dates " published since 1895 in the Annual 
Library Index, and the quarterly " Current Events In- 
dex," begun by the Wisconsin Free Library Commission, 
and published since 1910 by the H. W. Wilson Company 
as a feature of their " Readers' Guide to Periodical Lit- 
erature." In its new form this Index should prove of 
immense value to many sorts of workers, forming as it 
does a classified summary of the world's news. 

Foremost among articles of contemporary interest in 
" The Hibbert Journal " for January is that by Sir Oliver 
Lodge defending the philosophy of Henri Bergson 
against the recent strictures of Mr. Balfour. Professor 
J. Arthur Thomson continues his discussion, " Is There 
One Science of Nature ? " making out a strong case for 
those biologists who call themselves "vitalists," and 
who deny that life can ever be understood or expressed 
much less created in terms of chemical or mechani- 
cal reactions. A summary of recent philosophical liter- 
ature by Professor G. Dawes Hicks brings the general 
reader into intelligent touch with some most interest- 
ing developments in the field. The American agents for 
"The Hibbert Journal " are Messrs. Sherman, French 
&Co. 

That Dickens has a considerable vogue in France is 
shown in the extracts from appreciations by some dis- 
tinguished French critics printed in a recent number of 
the popular weekly journal, " Les Annales." M. Gaston 
Deschamps, M. Paul Ginisty, M. Anatole France, M. 
Jules Claretie, and M. Adolphe Brisson, are all to be 
found among the admirers of Dickens, M. Ginisty going 
so far as to say that " Dickens is one of the very few 
foreign writers who have exerted an influence on French 
literature, and who have retained that influence." The 
same journal states that the Franco-Russian Association 
of the University of Paris proposes to celebrate the 
centenary of Dickens's birth by a lecture at the Sor- 
bonne, and readings from " David Copperfield," in 
which several of the leading actors and actresses of 
Paris will take part. 

The library of the Bureau of Education, at Washing- 
ton, has attained a size and importance unsuspected by 
many who would otherwise be glad to avail themselves 
of its freely-offered privileges. Numbering more than 
one hundred thousand volumes, the collection consti- 
tutes the best pedagogical library in the country, and 
under its present management it is constantly growing 
in size and usefulness. Its rooms are open to readers 
and students, and it lends books freely to those at a dis- 
tance, either by the inter-library system of loans, or 
directly to individual borrowers, books being sent out 
by mail, under frank, and retainable for two weeks as a 
rule. Special lists and bibliographies are furnished upon 
request, and in other ways the resources of the library 
are turned to the utmost possible profit of its users.

The Squirrel Cage 

A personal and real tale of what might have happened to 
any one of us. 

This original and complete version of Lydia Emery's love 
story embraces the influence on her life of her family ; of her 
lovable godfather ; of her husband, a potential captain of 
industry; and of a radical young cabinet maker. Lydia 
grows from a care-free girl to a mature woman, who knows 
life and wants to choose for her children's happiness and 
her own. unhampered by what the "social" hierarchy of a 
middle western town say and think. Her story makes us ask 
whether the social and business system which virtually sep- 
arate husbands from their wives and children is worth the 
material prosperity it creates or the sacrifice of comradeship 
usually necessary to keep the establishment whirling ?

made a prisoner in her home. Perils and stirring episodes 
abound, rising to a big vivid climax. The Botton Transcript

the memory . . . Noble passion holding the balance between 
life and death."

TEA VEL AND C UL T URE. 

The value of travel as a means of culture has 
long been recognized, and everything that tends 
to lessen its difficulties, and to increase the 
number of those who may avail themselves of 
its inspiring influence, should be welcomed as 
an aid to that enlargement of view, that deepen- 
ing of sympathy, and that enrichment of the 
mind which are the objects of culture, by what- 
ever paths it be pursued. To " survey man- 
kind from China to Peru " with one's own eyes 
is certainly the cultural equivalent for a great 
many college courses or other formal endeavors 
to gain an education. To quote Dr. Johnson's 
familiar words : " That man is little to be en- 
vied whose patriotism would not gain force upon 
the plain of Marathon, or whose piety would not 
grow warmer among the ruins of lona." The 
development of patriotism and piety may not 
be reckoned among the avowed aims of the edu- 
cational process, but they are assuredly more de- 
sirable elements of culture than is the pedantry 
which is the product of too close an application 
to the letter of learning. 

It would be interesting to trace the growth 
of this idea during the last few centuries. The 
wandering scholar of the middle ages doubtless 
had some sub-conscious notion of the way in 
which the impressions of travel were enriching 
his life, even if the perils of his encounters with 
highwaymen and pirates and robber barons filled 
the forefront of his consciousness, leaving scant 
opportunity for introspective survey. It was the 
excitement of adventure, and the wonder of the 
unknown, rather than any set purpose of self- 
improvement, that impelled the Elizabethans 
upon their journeyings to far lands and among 
strange peoples ; but they were building better 
than they knew, and laying the foundations, not 
of character alone, but also of a large intellectual 
tolerance which was making them citizens of 
the world of ideas rather than denizens of some 
bailiwick of provincial prejudice. They might 
return laden with Spanish treasure, or bursting 
with the report of the new lands of their discov- 
ery ; they also brought themselves back as new 
men, transformed by contact with distant things 
and peoples, filled with rich memories, and with 
a clear-eyed capacity for dealing intelligently 
with their own personal problems of thought and

action. The Horatian saying that "who cross 
the seas their skies change, not their souls" is 
not to be accepted without qualification; such 
changes as are possible to the soul in the way of 
development are quite naturally brought about 
by foreign travel. It was a realization of this 
truth that made the seventeenth and eighteenth 
century descendant of the adventurous Eliza- 
bethan regard the " grand tour " as the crowning 
stage of a young gentleman's education, as the 
one thing essential to transform the mere scholar 
into the man of the world. 

Travel may, in fact, be taken as one of the 
most searching tests of personality, and often 
discloses unexpected capacities and possibilities. 
How sharply do the experiences of travel serve 
to bring out the contrast between the vacuous 
mind and stolid temperament, on the one hand, 
and the richly-furnished intelligence allied with 
emotional capacity on the other! Somewhere 
in the writings of Thomas Arnold of Rugby there 
is a passage upon the Mediterranean Sea, in 
which its meaning to the traveller who beholds 
in it only a body of water with picturesque 
shores is contrasted with its meaning to the trav- 
eller who views it in the light of its immense 
historical suggestiveness, and in whose richly- 
stored mind it evokes a tumultuous throng of 
images which make the past live anew in color 
and in action. With what quickening of mem- 
ory and exaltation of spirit does the pilgrim who 
is worthy of the experience visit the old-world 
spots where great issues have trembled in the 
balance upon the field of battle Marathon, 
Lake Trasimene, Stiklestad, Senlac, Aspro- 
monte; the spots which offer their mute testi- 
mony to the vanished glory of the past Car- 
thage, Ravenna, Visby, Thingvalla, Avignon; 
the spots hallowed by association with some 
great cause Nicaea, Runnyraede, the Wart- 
burg, the Kutli. Eidsvold; the spots consecrated 
to shining examples of what the soul of man may 
achieve Florence, Stratford, Weimar, Konigs- 
berg, Bayreuth ; the spots invested by legend with 
a significance that rivals fact in its appeal to 
the imagination Sinai, Delphi, Avernus, the 
Venusberg, Montserrat. Each of these places, 
and each of countless others, may become to the 
reader much more than a geographical expres- 
sion, to the visitor, much more than a halting- 
place to be remembered chiefly by the quality 
of its inn, if he but prepare himself by study 
and reflection for the revelation which it has to 
offer. 

The case of the typical AmM-ir:n man of busi- 
ness in Europe upon a vacation is, rightly con- 



sidered, one of the most pitiable that can be 
imagined. It is, indeed, a vacation of the mind, 
for its customary content is lacking, and there 
is no iv>idiimu of thought and feeling to de- 
rive healthy and truly re-creative exercise from 
contact with its strange new environment. I It- 
demands material comforts, and usually gets 
them, for their price is measured in the material 
coin with which his pockets are lined. But those 
delights which are purchasable only with the 
coin of knowledge and of taste are unknown to 
him. He finds no texts in the Bible of Amiens, 
no sermons in the Stones of Venice; for him are 
the Seven Lamps of Architecture kindled in 
vain. He has not the historical consciousness 
which would tell another that he was treading 
on holy ground, or the social consciousness which 
in another would bear fruit of penetrative sym- 
pathy with the life of alien peoples. For him. 
the galleries of art are sights to be wearily 
"done" when there is no escape from the duty; 
the concert-hall has no message for one who 
thinks of music only as an adjunct of the res- 
taurant and the street parade, and the theatre 
no instruction for one who is ignorant of all 
tongues but his own nasal speech. So he con- 
sorts with his fellow Americans, sharers in a 
common boredom, and his converse with them 
is of the market reports, and of such news from 
America as trickles into his ear from the Conti- 
nental press. 

The case of his children is equally pathetic, 
although youth has possibilities which save the 
case from being quite hopeless. Ruskin describes 
it once for all in "Fors Clavigera." He was 
going from Venice to Verona by the afternoon 
train, and in the carriage were two American 
girls with their parents. 

" Here they were, specimens of the utmost which the 
money and invention of the nineteenth century could pro- 
duce in maidenhood children of its most progressive 
race enjoying the full advantages of political liberty, 
of enlightened philosophical education, of cheap pilfered 
literature, and of luxury at any cost. . . . And they 
were travelling through a district which, if any in the 
world, should touch the hearts and delight the eyes of 
young girls. Between Venice and Verona ! Portia's 
villa perhaps in sight upon the Brenta, Juliet's tomb 
to be visited in the evening, blue against the Southern 
sky, the hills of Petrarch's home. Exquisite midsummer 
sunshine, with low rays, glanced through the vine-leaves; 
all the Alps were clear, from the Lake of Garda to 
Cadore, and to farthest Tyrol. What a princess's cham- 
ber, this, if these are princesses, and what dreams might 
they not dream, therein ! But the two American girls 
were neither princesses, nor S-TS. nor dreamers. By 
infinite self-indulgence, they had reduced themselves 
simply to two pieces of white putty that could feel pain. 
The Hies and dust stuck to them as to clay, and they 
perceived, between Venice and Verona, nothing but the

flies and the dvist. They pulled down the blinds the 
moment they entered the carriage, and then sprawled, 
and writhed, and tossed among the cushions of it, with 
every miserable sensation of bodily affliction that could 
make time intolerable. They were dressed in thin 
white frocks, coming vaguely open at the backs as they 
stretched or wriggled; they had French novels, lemons, 
and lumps of sugar, to beguile their state with; the 
novels hanging together by the ends of string that had 
once stitched them ; or adhering at the corners in densely 
bruised dog's-ears, out of which the girls, wetting their 
fingers, occasionally extricated a gluey leaf. From time 
to time, they cut a lemon open, ground a lump of sugar 
backwards and forwards over it till every fibre was in 
a treacly pulp; then sucked the pulp, and gnawed the 
white skin into leathery strings, for the sake of its bitter. 
Only one sentence was exchanged, in the fifty miles, on 
the subject of things outside the carriage (the Alps being 
once visible from a station where they had drawn up 
the blinds). 

' Do n't those snow-caps make you cool ? ' 

<No I wish they did.' 

And so they went their way, with sealed eyes and tor- 
mented limbs, their numbered miles of pain." 

It sometimes seems as if the means of travel, 
and the opportunities which it offers for culture, 
were most frequently allotted by a malicious 
fate to just those people who are congenitally 
or by virtue of defective training incapable of 
responding to its stimulus or appreciating its 
advantages, while those who might profit by it 
most richly are restricted to travel of the arm- 
chair and fire-side sort, perhaps supplemented 
by visits to the picture-show. There is not a 
little to be said for these vicarious forms of 
travel, and photography has done much to bring 
to our doors the " sights " which formerly could 
be seen only at the cost of long journeyings. 
One who has witnessed, for example, an exhibi- 
tion of the colored film-pictures of last year's 
Coronation, feels that he has actually been pres- 
ent at the spectacle, and has, indeed, in some 
respects seen it to better advantage than would 
have been possible to the average tourist. The 
profusely illustrated book of travel reproduces 
distant scenes, including many that the tourist 
would find it difficult to view, in such a way as to 
make them seem very familiar. There are many 
respects in which these substitutes for experience 
are inadequate, but they provide a resource that 
was hardly dreamed of by the last generation. 

As for travel itself, while it is not cheap, ex- 
cept for those who "rough it " on the road after 
the fashion of Bayard Taylor in his "Views 
Afoot," it is much less expensive than it used 
to be, and the " grand tour " no longer needs 
the outlay, and may be made with much more 
than the comfort, of the days in which it was 
not to be thought of by the multitude. One 
can go around the world at a surprisingly mod- 



erate cost, and so speedily that the eighty days, 
which seemed a marvel when Jules Verne wrote 
of the adventures of Phileas Fogg, has been 
reduced to sixty or less. To-day, one can book 
with any tourist agency for Vladivostok or 
Samarcand, for Delhi or Khartoum. Both 
Hammarfest and Sandy Point are included in 
the regular vacation itinerary, and both offer the 
apparatus of civilization to welcome the visitor. 
Special excursions enable one to visit the Spanish 
Main and the Caucasus and the ^Egean under 
luxurious conditions, and this very summer one 
can, if one wishes, embark upon a monster 
steamship at Bremen, sail to the palseocrystic 
sea within something like ten degrees distance 
from the North Pole, and return to the starting- 
point exactly four weeks from the date of de- 
parture. Another summer will perhaps provide 
an excursion to the ice-barrier of the Antarctic, 
now that the explorations of Shackleton and 
Amundsen have made it familiar. There is 
wonder in all this, even if the eyes of the mar- 
iner behold no mount of Purgatory rising from 
the remote seas ; and whatever keeps alive the 
sense of wonder makes an important contribu- 
tion to the life of culture. 



THE PROBLEM OF LAFCADIO HEARN. 

"Form and substance are one," says William 
Blake somewhere ; and continues : " I have heard 
many people say, ' Give me the ideas, it is no mat- 
ter what words you put them into,' and others say, 
' Give me the design, it is no matter for the execu- 
tion.' These people knew enough of artifice, but 
nothing of art. Ideas cannot be given but in their 
minutely appropriate words, nor can a design be made 
without its minutely appropriate execution." 

Spoken by Flaubert, there would be nothing sur- 
prising in the statement which I have copied out as 
a kind of text. Emanating from an English poet, 
it holds our attention as being foreign to the Anglo- 
Saxon standpoint. If, however, one were asked 
what author, out of all our writers of yesterday, 
practised such a doctrine, one could name his man. 
In the work of Laf cadio Hearn, at least, " form and 
substance are one." By fate's irony, one of his critics 
has yet been able to write with a shade of justifica- 
tion that Hearn " created or invented nothing ; his 
stories were always told him by others. ... A 
multicolored echo." It was Hearn, withal, who 
most perfectly represents, among the modern writ- 
ers whom I know, a harmony of sense and form, of 
words and music. Now, Hearn's mystery derived, 
not from any literary obscurity, but from his reserve 
toward the general public, from his unfortunate way 
of dropping those with whom he had entered upon 
terms of intimacy, from the clouds which obscure his

beginnings, and, finally, from his disappearance into 
the East, and his absorption of or by that East's 
greater mysteries. Thus it is that Stedman could 
assert that "Hearn will in time )>< a- much of a 
romantic personality and tradition as Poe is now." 
For the moment, however, the enigma of the writer's 
personality pales before another enigma : that of his 
work. How reconcile the paradox of one for whom 
form and substance are one, yet whose nature was 
chameleon-like, and whose plumes were borrowed? 
How reconcile other seeming incongruities, only too 
easily suggested ? * 

Certainly there is something baffling about every- 
thing that he put his hand to if we except his 
journeyman's work (and very good work, too) as a 
newspaper writer. His interpretation of Japan has 
been fairly described as the most remarkable at- 
tempt at the interpretation of an alien race ever 
made, in any language ; and yet it was produced 
by one who never himself mastered the Japanese 
tongue. This is not the chief difficulty, however. 
For what are we to think of his interpretation of 
the elder civilization of Japan not merely in the 
book which he calls " Japan : An Attempt at Inter- 
pretation," but as we find it in all his volumes of 
studies and legends ? What are we to think of it, 
that is, now that certain documents of an intimate 
sort have been recently published in the so-called 

One of these startling incongruities is revealed by Hearn 
himself in describing his method of composition in the final 
period of his craftsmanship. There are two methods of 
work, he writes: the first (fatiguing beyond expression) is 
"to force thought by concentration"; the second "is to 
force the work only, and let the thought develop itself." 

" The subject is before me; I can't bother even thinking about it. 
That would tire me too much. I simply arrange the note*, and write 
down whatever part of the subject most pleases me first. I write hur- 
riedly without care. Then I put the MS. aside for the day, and do 
something else more agreeable. Next day I read over the page* written, 
correct, and write them all over again. In the course of doing this, 
quite mechanically, new thoughU come up, error* make themselves 
felt, improvement* are suggested. I stop. Next day I rewrite the 
third time. This I* the best time. The result is a great improvement 
usually, but not perfection. I then take clean paper and begin to 
make the final copy. Usually, this ha* to be done twice. In the course 
of four or fire rewriting*, the whole thought reshapes itself, and the 
whole style U changed and fixed. The work ha* done itself, developed, 
grown ; it would have been very different had I trusted to the first 
thought. . . . 

"The result is amazing. The average is five perfect page* (not 
printed page*) a day, with about two or three hour*' work. By the 
other method one or two page* a day are extremely difficult to write 
. . . though ... I have had to rewrite page* fifty tune*." 

While industry is attested, so too is a singular limitation 
in mental force. I cannot help wondering how nearly thin 
method of composition comes to Flaubert's Flaubert not only 
being an object of Beam's admiration, but an equally labored 
stylist. Mr. Hnneker, it is true, has a shrewd suspicion that 
Flaubert nursed the " legend " of his terrible pangs in literary 
creation, and hints that life at Croisset consisted in no small 
degree in the pleasures of sleep and Ji finer if and pipe-smoking. 
Flaubert is only one of the modern Frenchmen whom Hearn 
studied with zeal ; besides translating the " Saint-Antoine," 
a volume by Gautier, and France's "Sylvestre Bonnard," 
he translated for the New Orleans " Times-Democrat " about 
two hundred stories and passages, chiefly from contemporary 
French literature. Hearn himself has been translated into 
French, in part, at least ; while a sympathetic critical and 
biographical study by M. Joseph de Smet appeared only last 
fall (Paris: Mercure de France). As M. de Smet remarks, 
Hearn "studied painstakingly all the line issued from Flau- 
bert," and "his methods of work were formed in that study." 



" Japanese Letters," edited by his sympathetic biog- 
rapher ? 

One may learn here how melancholy was the man. 
'* I am absolutely unproductive now," he writes in 
one letter of depression ; " hovering between one 
thing and another, sometimes angry with men, 
sometimes with the Gods." But we were aln-ailv 
aware how pathetic was this figure, best likened (in 
the simile of a Japanese poem of the people) to 
" The water-weed drifting, finding no place of attachment.'* 
The first value of the " Japanese Letters " lies, not 
so much in the insight they give us into Hearn'H 
personality, as in the light they throw or seem to 
throw, since we are for the moment left in no little 
perplexity on Hearn's later writings. What are 
we to think when the author of " Kwaidan " and 
" Kokoro " writes : 

" The finale of my long correspondence with you on the 
Japanese character is frankly this ... I hate and detest 
the Japanese . . ." 

adding, wistfully, "There's a nice confession"; 
then, with more vigor, " D n the Japanese ! " 

Before deciding what to think of it all, one may 
read further. A letter to his American friend, \\ . 
B. Mason, is instructive. "Professor Chamberlain 
spoke to me about the variability of one's feelings 
toward Japan being like the oscillations of a pen- 
dulum : one day swinging towards pessimism, and 
the next to optimism. I have this feeling very 
often, and I suppose you must have had it many 
times. But the pessimistic feeling is generally 
coincident with some experience of New Japan, 
and the optimistic with something of Old Japan. 
. . . With what hideous rapidity Japan is modern- 
izing after all! " 

For one who has read Hearn with either thorough- 
ness or sympathy, there is no suspicion that he was 
to an appreciable degree insincere in his writings 
about the Japanese. He was at first radiantly happy 
in achieving his life-dream: the study of the Oriental 
mind at close range ; life in a wonderful exotic king- 
dom of flowers and singing cicada. But, apart from 
the fact that Japan is itself in transition, apart 
from the fact that the student of Japan must oscil- 
late, as Hearn says Professor Chamberlain put it. 
between optimism and pessimism, admiration and 
repulsion, there is the personal element to be taken 
into account. Hearn was Hearn. That means, in 
part, that he was one of those who have set up 
" Whim " over their portals. It means, too, that he 
was a victim of romantic nostalgia literally, as well 
as in critics' cant, a native of No-man's Land. To 
quote this man himself, he suffered from the 
nostalgia which is rather a world-sickness than a 
home-sickness" " like an unutterable wish to flee 
away from the Present into the Unknown." It was 
not in him to be lastingly happy anywhere. Earlier, 
in New Orleans, his imagination, captured at first by 
the tropical and intoxicating beauty of the old 
Creole city, with all its contrasts, was soon satt-.l, 
and we find him writing to Mr. Krehbiel, at New 
York, " I am very weary of New Orleans. The cit \

of my dreams . . . has vanished." Philosophically, 
morally, and aesthetically, no less than nationally, he 
was a hybrid and hybrids are notoriously unhappy. 

But to return to his own report of Japan. It is 
well to reread, now that we have the new instal- 
ment of Letters, the " Attempt at Interpretation." 
" According to the degree of altruism within your- 
self," he writes of the Japanese, "these good folk 
will be able, without any apparent effort, to make you 
happy. The mere sensation of the milieu is a placid 
happiness. . . . Yes, for a little time these fairy folk 
can give you all the soft bliss of sleep." Neither 
here nor elsewhere does Hearn tell us of the other 
side of the picture, tell us, that is, in concrete 
terms. Except in his correspondence, he scarcely 
hints at anything morally unbeautiful. Nor does 
he discuss the evil smells of the town, its beggars 
and lepers. As we grow, nowadays, to know Hearn 
better, we realize how he strove in all his writings 
about Japan to throw over his reader that spell of 
illusion cast, for a time, over himself. This is, it 
seems to me, the lesson of these new letters, which 
made, on the first reading, so harsh an impression. 
But that his earlier contentment in Japan was illu- 
sionary, he himself knew : knew long before the rest 
of us ; knew long before cruel and perhaps unjust 
treatment was accorded him as a teacher in the 
Imperial University. u It will lift at last," he writes 
in his " Japan " of this fondly cherished illusion, 
" like those vapors of spring which lend preter- 
natural loveliness to a Japanese landscape in the fore- 
noon of radiant days. Really you are happy because 
you have entered bodily into Fairyland, into a 
world that is not, and never could be, your own." 

In Hearn's tales of Old Japan, and in his wonder- 
ful essays, he brings us very close to the wonder- 
land that he sketches for us in the "Interpretation." 
But what was Hearn's literary doctrine? He ex- 
pounds it in a letter of June, 1908 ( " Life and 
Letters," II., 343). 

"Artistic literature can never be raw truth, any more than 
a photograph can be compared with a painting. Here is a 
little sentence from one of the greatest of modern French 
writers: 'Z,a litterature n'a pas la verite pout I'objet. II faut 
demander la ve'rite' aux sciences . . . il ne faut pas la de- 
mander k la litterature, qui n'a et ne pent avoir d'objet que 
le beau.'' " 

I have written these sentences from Anatole 
France, quoted by one who received them as gospel, 
across the flyleaf of "Out of the East." In justice to 
him who reproduced them, I have added what Hearn 
himself adds in his letter : " Remember that noth- 
ing can be beautiful which does not contain truth." 
Fortunately, if we only read aright, Hearn's best 
work stands even his own tests tests not wanting 
in severity. Practically, as well as in his theory of 
aesthetics, the writer made noteworthy progress. 

No really satisfactory account of Hearn has yet 
appeared. In many ways the most comprehensive 
is Mrs. Nina H. Kennard's recently-published vol- 
ume, faulty as it is in details. But I hope that we may 
long be spared a " scientific " biography of Hearn. 



Knowledge of those who have wrought exquisite 
things is not always to be had with impunity. It is not 
always even desirable. There were dark places in the 
career of this elusive genius who, without belong- 
ing to the family of the greater geniuses, succeeded 
as no one else in retelling the tales of Old Japan in 
the English tongue, and in imparting to what Mr. 
Noguchi described as his " Spencerian-Buddhistic 
Studies " a charming and penetrating accent of 
mystery. Hearn's Japanese critic lays emphasis, 
however, on the retold tales : and here we must fol- 
low him. Hearn's later work, done in the gray and 
blue coloring of his adopted country, though it wants 
the fire and enthusiasm of his first impressions, re- 
ceives the highest praise of the Japanese, as shining 
with Hearn's " golden light, which was as old as a 
spring in Horai ; its slowness was poetry and its 
reticence was a blessing." No longer did this writer 
practise style for style's sake. Let us then be con- 
tent with the knowledge that his best poetry, his 
" blessings," have an appeal truer and deeper than 
that of mere exoticism, skilfully managed like 
the japoneries of Pierre Loti. Their beauty is not 
wasted even upon the critic born in the land of 
whose myths and elder traditions they are the 
treasury. 

And while we have testimony that the Japanese 
home-life of the man whose " absolute lack of prac- 
tical sexual virtue " one of his American judges has 
condemned, was, in reality, idyllic, let us not dwell 
on that: if only to avoid the reopening of contro-

CAS UAL COMMENT. 

THE WAYS OF ARCHIVISTS are not always like 
those of the lately -retired Adjutant-General whose 
custodianship of the War Department archives might 
remind a visitor of the rules metrically formulated 
by the admirable Jared Bean in his famous " Old 
Librarian's Almanack." From the " Ars Bibliothe- 
carii," there made public, we quote four pertinent 
lines : 

" Let naught intrude ; to all the World be blind, 
And chase each vain allurement from your Mind. 
Be also deaf : 't is well to turn the Lock, 
And let who will the outer portal knock.'' 

An impressive array of remonstrances against this 
safe and conservative guardianship of literary treas- 
ure appears in the New York " Evening Post," from 
certain scholars who in the past have sought to 
pursue their researches among the archives of the 
War Department. One of these remonstrants, for 
example, desired that certain files of old newspapers 
might be rendered accessible to historians, and with 
the approval and encouragement of high govern- 
ment officials he applied for permission to explain 
his wishes. But, with a deep sense of the sacred- 
ness of his person as custodian of government prop- 
erty, the archivist refused to admit the applicant to 
his presence, and sent a colored servant to announce 



268

[April 1, 



that the newspapers were stored away and nothing 
could be done in the matter. Another indignant 
gentleman, instead of praising this faithful watch- 
dog of the archives, has something to say about a 
dog in the manger; and still another even claims 
that the effete monarchies of the Old World are 
ahead of us in their housing of and care for govern- 
ment documents. " Even Finland," he goes so far 
as to aftirm, " has a handsome Staatsarchiv, which 
I had the pleasure of visiting recently, and where I 
found the records very intelligently cared for and 
the way of the investigator made smooth and allur- 
ing." Would not the excellent Jared Bean have 
shuddered to contemplate such exposure of ancient 
archives to the public gaze and touch ? 


OUR ENGLISH GUEST, the one who at the present 
writing is holding our interested attention, is Mr. 
John Galsworthy. It is a relief to be assured that 
he has not come to receive impressions for future 
literary use in the magazines, although one of his 
alertness, his keenness of observation, his suscepti- 
bility to impressions, could not well avoid receiving 
a good many new and, we hope, favorable impres- 
sions while he tarries with us. " A man whose busi- 
ness it is to write," he is reported as saying, " and 
who has any human feeling whatsoever, can't go 
through the streets of London, or of any other place. 
and see the people, and the lives they live, without 
being moved. He sees wrongness and injustice and 
suffering, and so he writes about wrongness and in- 
justice and suffering. And if he is an artist and a 
human man, he suffers, too. And so the purpose of 
what he writes, the picturing of something that is bad 
and should be made better,is utterly unconscious. And 
it is inevitable . . . for a man who writes, who sees 
and writes what he sees, it is just inevitable." It 
is this " inevitability " in Mr. Galsworthy's as in 
every other true artist's work that gives it its excel- 
lence; and so, after all, we hope he will feel him- 
self inevitably moved to utterance by some of the 
American scenes and events that meet his eyes.

PRIMITIVE LIBRARY ECONOMY, often of an amus- 
ing nature, forms the subject of some of Mr. Ernest 
A. Savage's scholarly and interesting chapters in 
his recent book, " Old English Libraries." Rules 
governing the circulation of books at Oxford and 
Cambridge in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries 
were of a sort that would in this age of hustle and 
hurry arouse much dissatisfaction. We complain 
now, and with some reason, if we are denied the 
privilege of exchanging a book the same day it is 
borrowed ; but at Oriel College the borrowers could 
take out books from the college library only onoe a 
year, and only one book at a time, while at Peter- 
house it was ruled that all the books not chained 
might be circulated once every two years on a day 
to be fixed by the Master and Senior Dean." But 
at New College an exceptional liberality prevailed : 
- students in civil and canon law could have two 
books [at once, apparently] for their special use 



during the time they devoted themselves to those 
facilities" ami "if books remained over, after tin-* 
distribution, they were to be distributed annually in 
the usual way." So precious were books in th<.>- 
ante- printing-press days that at this -aim- college 
three different locks, two large and one small, \\ ei . 
used to secure the library door, the Senior Dean and 
the Senior Bursar holding the keys to the la 
locks, and each Fellow having a key to the smaller. 



KTIIAN FKMI:" IN FI:AN :. where the Mory 
seems to be meeting with success in the pages of 
"La Revue de Paris," may serve to illustrate once 
more the truth t hat the most local and peculiar and 
even privately personal, if set down with sincerity 
and touched with imagination and warmed with |V-1- 
ing, is pretty sure to prove itself the most univei>al. 
the most unfailingly interesting to all readers, the 
most irresistibly appealing to the great heart of man- 
kind. The dreary little New England village of 
Stark field and the petty cares and anxieties of Ethan 
and Zeena and Matty seem unromantic enough, to be 
sure; but their illustration, in little, of the troubles 
and limitations that beset us all gives the story a 
human interest independent of the scene in which 
the homely drama is set or the language in which 
the characters speak. This success of Mrs. Whar- 
ton's in France recalls Mrs. Stowe's experience with 
her New England tale of "Oldtown Folks." After 
expressing to George Eliot her fear that the book 
would be a flat failure in England because of its 
strictly local character, she was assured that tin- 
very character gave it interest and charm to English 
readers; and, in fact, it seems to have been ver\ 
well received in England. " Look in thy heart and 
write" about the things nearest thee, is just as good 
advice now as in Sir Philip Sidney's day. 


DR. TALCOTT WILLIAMS, DIRECTOR OF THE 
PULITZER SCHOOL OK JOURNALISM, will enter upon 
the duties of the office to which he has just been ap- 
pointed at the opening of the college year in Sep- 
tember. He is well equipped for the position, being 
not only a journalist and editor himself of almost 
forty years' standing, but also a scholar and lecturer 
and writer of wide repute. Born in India ( the son 
of a missionary) sixty-two years ago, Mr. William* 
received his academic training at Amherst and be- 
gan his course in practical journalism with the New 
York "World," serving afterward on the staff of 
the "Sun," on that of the Springfield " Republican." 
and for the last thirty years on that of the Phila- 
delphia " Press." As chief editorial writer to the last- 
named journal, he has contributed no little toward 
its high standing in the newspaper world. At the 
University of Pennsylvania and elsewhere he has 
been a frequent lecturer. In his new position he 
will, it is announced, give instruction in the history 
and ethics of journalism. His associate director 
will be Professor John I). Cunliffe, at present the 
head of the English department at the University of 
Wisconsin.

MOVING A LARGE BOOK-COLLECTION, such as that 
of a great public library when a new building is 
taken possession of, presents some practical problems, 
especially when it is desired to interrupt as little as 
possible the free use and circulation of the books 
themselves. Few such removals have been effected 
as speedily as that which took place recently in 
Springfield, Mass., upon the completion of that 
city's new library building. As the old and the new 
buildings were but a few rods apart, a mechanical 
conveying apparatus a sort of elevated railway 
was used for the trans-shipment, and the entire col- 
lection of 180,000 volumes was moved in seven days, 
without an hour's interruption to the regular library 
service. Compare this with the record of the Boston 
Public Library, for example, in 1894-95. It is true 
that the old Boylston Street building was half a mile 
or more from the new one in Copley Square, which 
made impossible any such speedy transfer as at 
Springfield. As a matter of fact, moving operations 
began December 14, and were finished January 28, 
though the circulation of books from the new build- 
ing did not begin until March 4, after being, dis- 
continued at the old more than a month before. 
Therefore, though the actual momentum mass 
multiplied by velocity may have been not so very 
different in the two instances, still one must view 
with admiration and approbation the late Springfield 
achievement. ... 

ECONOMY OF EFFORT IN WRITING, just as in 
speaking, though to a lesser extent, is continually 
producing abbreviations unknown to an earlier gen- 
eration. At the present moment a tendency is observ- 
able to contract '' in so far " into one word. We have 
long had "inasmuch"; why not, then, "insofar"? 
"Nevertheless" now strikes no reader as odd or 
barbarous, and the day will doubtless come when 
"nonetheless" will take its place in the dictionary 
as a single word. Many readers not yet old will 
recall the time when "any one "and "everyone" and 
the less common "onto" were invariably printed as 
"any one" and "every one" and "on to." The 
last-named is still in the transition stage. Rather 
remarkable is it that "to-day" and "to-morrow" 
and "o'clock," common though they are and written 
every day by nearly everyone, still remain in a state 
of imperfect compression, though one does occasion- 
ally see "today" and "tomorrow" in print, and 
more often in writing. These slight changes and 
economies that the decades work in our speech, 
written as well as spoken, though they may evoke 
a sigh now and then from the purist or the old fogy, 
nevertheless pleasantly serve as vivid reminders that 
it is a living language in which we express our 
thoughts, and not a medium to be unalterably fixed 
or artificially fitted by worrisome word-tinkerers to 
some Procrustean bed of phonetics. 

MR. MORGAN'S GIFT TO GOTTINGEN UNIVERSITY, 
whereby the English literature department finds 
itself enriched to the extent of fifty thousand dollars, 
recalls the fact that two years of the donor's youth 



were spent in study (and some other things) at that 
famous old seminary of learning. But it was in 
mathematics and not in literature that he specialized, 
and one might have expected him to spend his spare 
pin-money in strengthening the mathematical depart- 
ment, the more so as he appears to have been a 
favorite of his teacher there. Years after the young 
American student had completed his course in mathe- 
matics and mud-baths at Gottingen, as his biographer, 
Mr. Carl Hovey, now relates, the professor of mathe- 
matics under whom he had studied visited this coun- 
try and found his former pupil a commanding figure 
in the world of finance. Meeting him at a dinner 
given in honor of the German visitor, the latter 
created some amusement by deploring the financier's 
defection from pure science, where if he had only 
remained he might unquestionably have become as- 
sistant professor of mathematics at Gdttingen, and, 
on the death of the incumbent, would undoubtedly 
have succeeded to the professorship. But the 
promising pupil had perversely chosen to apply his 
mathematical knowledge to more practical problems 
than were likely to arise at Gottingen.

TARIFF BARS AGAINST IMPORTED BOOKS are about 
to be raised still higher if a recent decision of the 
Treasury Department, as announced by the Ap- 
praiser of the Port of New York, is to be the rule 
governing future customs duties on such importa- 
tions. This decision is aimed particularly at those 
American publishers who import imprinted editions 
of English publications in quantities of from one 
hundred to several thousand copies. Often such 
books are cooperative enterprises, the expense of 
which is borne equally by the English and the Ameri- 
can publisher; and the American edition is therefore 
invoiced for customs purposes at its proportionate 
share of the actual cost of manufacture. Heretofore 
the duty has been paid on such actual cost ; but the 
zealous Appraiser now proposes an innovation. "I 
shall hereafter," runs his announcement, "appraise 
imported bound books at the price at which identical 
books are being freely sold in the English market 
by the English publisher in the usual wholesale quan- 
tity." Mr. George Haven Putnam, champion of the 
rights of readers, authors, and publishers alike, pro- 
tests eloquently and we hope effectively against this 
amazing ruling. Indeed, we cannot believe that such 
an unjust position will long be maintained.

D'ANNUNZIO AS A NATIONAL POET. 

(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 
I seem to recall having seen in THK DIAL some 
vague and rather unsympathetic notice of the re- 
markable series of Canzoni in triple rhyme which 
Gabriele d'Annunzio printed in rapid succession last 
fall in the Corriere delta Sera of Milan. On the 
24th of January a first edition of this poem was 
sequestrated by a timid administration on account 
of a few satirical stanzas of which I shall submit a 
free translation. A second edition of the book now 
appears, beautifully printed by Treves. Now this 
book impresses me as being perhaps the most re- 
markable one yet produced by d'Annunzio, who, 
despite prejudice, remains, such as he is, the first 
poet of Italy since the death of Carducci, M incon- 
testably as was Swinburne the first poet of En- 
gland after the death of Tennyson. Formally, the 
book is the fourth volume of the Laudi (Lauds of 
Heaven, Sea, Earth, and Heroes). It consists of ten 
cantos of masterly versification, whose titles I ren- 
der as follows : The Song of Oversea, the Song 
of Blood, the Song of the Sacrament, the Song of 
the Trophies, the Song of Diana, the Song of Helen 
of France, the Song of the Dardanelles, the Song 
of Humbert Cagni, the Song of Mario Bianco, the 
Last Song. 

The poem is certainly full of dazzling passages, 
though I apprehend that it will be found as a whole 
somewhat lacking in sustained power, and in single 
cantos more or less invertebrate. The form, and the 
frequent homage to Dante in the way of quotation 
or allusion, as well as the apostrophes to the cities 
of Italy, render comparison with the Divine Poet 
inevitable. Whether or not such comparison be, as 
may seem, challenged by the modern poet, it is cer- 
tainly unfortunate for him. With all his undeniable 
talent, eloquence, alertness, mastery of his instru- 
ment, d'Annunzio falls palpably short in the three 
qualifications in which Dante is supreme, in grasp, 
in seriousness of purpose, in character. But it is 
very unfair to suggest such a comparison, which 
would be crushing to any modern poet since Milton, 
and in some respects even to him. I leave criticism 
to those who shall be able to give the poem that 
exact scrutiny which it doubtless deserves, but for 
which I have not leisure. Time and patience, indeed, 
are requisite, inasmuch as the cantos swarm with 
allusions to local Italian history, local, perforce, 
because from the break-up of the Roman Empire to 
the founding of the Kingdom of Italy all Italian 
history was the history of a multitude of separate 



and generally warring communities rather than of 
a nation. Even intelligent Italians find themselves 
at sea upon this vast flood of local allusion, and the 
poet himself has felt the need of appending a com- 
mentary. Thin is a heavy handicap upon the r< a<l* i . 
who, in the course of these interesting historical ex- 
cursions, is apt to forget the starting-point. From 
this commentary I quote the following impressive 
words which give the key or leit-motiv of the poem : 
" That national consciotuneu is strongest which is moat 
intimately tempered by time and by example. . . . The 
most powerful nation is not that one which improvises its 
emtgy and ardor, bat rather that one which, with the faith 
and the will resultant from all it* past ages, as well as with 
its newly acquired virtue, broadens like a flood of many 
waters toward the unknown future. Therefore Memory is 
the Muse of this poem." 

Whether or not the poet has attained his purpose 
of being the Tyrtaeus of the Italian enterprise in 
North Africa, these cantos have at the present time 
a more than literary interest, are, indeed, the 
national apologia for that enterprise, an apologia 
the argument of which is briefly something like the 
following : For historical as well as for geographical 
reasons, Italy is, more than any other nation except 
Greece, vitally interested in maintaining itself upon 
that great sea which, under whatever name, Tyr- 
rhene, Ionic, Adriatic, /Kgean, is essentially one and 
Mediterranean. As the channel between the French 
coast and the English is necessarily the English 
Channel, so by equal political necessity the channel 
between Italy and Epirus is Otrantine, not Epirote, 
and the channel between Sicily and Tunis is not 
Tunisian but Sicilian. " Italia fara da se," said 
her greatest statesman ; she will not exist, as does 
the Kingdom of Greece, by the sufferance of her 
neighbors. Obviously she cannot fulfil the prophecy 
of Cavour, hemmed in on every side by powers each 
one of which is individually more powerful than 
she, while the supremacy of the Mediterranean is 
divided between England and France. Imagine 
England in the geographical situation of Italy : 
would not England's stake in the Mediterranean be 
immeasurably greater than it now is ? As to France, 
where she has twe great doors opening upon the 
Mediterranean she has four upon the Atlantic. The 
disintegrated despotism of Turkey, weak in all that 
respects efficient government, strong only in fanat- 
icism and ferocity, exists only by sufferance and 
not by what may be called, as in the case of Greece, 
an enlightened sufferance. If there be such a thing* 
as manifest destiny, it would seem to point to an 
Italian protectorate in Tunis, which stretches its 
arms toward Italy halfway across the sea, can, 
indeed, be seen in fair weather from Sicily. Italy 
was too weak to dispute the claims of France in that 
quarter, but she has other and better than strategical 
reasons for still insisting upon a footing on the north 
coast of Africa: the same reasons that Japan has for 
demanding a footing on the nearest mainland. The 
over-exploited Italian peninsula, rich as it naturally 
is, has not bread enough for all her swarming chil- 
dren, who are obliged to seek it through the world

from the Levant to Argentina. What more natural 
than that Italy should anticipate France or Ger- 
many or Austria in establishing a colony on that 
part of the North African shore which is still prac- 
tically vacant and ungoverned ? It is a question of 
economic as well as of national independence. The 
justifications that English, French, American states- 
men put forward for their respective acts of " benev- 
olent absorption " in the Transvaal, in Algiers, in 
the Philippines, were shadowy in comparison with 
those of Italy for her adventure in Tripolitania and 
Cyrenaica. If results have justified the English 
" condominium " in Egypt and the French colon- 
ization of Algeria, we may fairly expect that the 
Italian empire over the waiting desert may equally 
justify itself. 

Considerations like these may appear out of place 
in a purely literary article, but they are in fact essen- 
tial to an appreciation of the point of view of the 
Italian national poet. Whatever may be the final 
decision of the civilized world as to the rights and 
wrongs of questions so complicated as those here 
raised, the observer who would understand the pres- 
ent remarkable unanimity of the Italian nation, the 
reader who would give ear to the most recent strains 
of the Italian Muse, must accord at least imaginative 
sympathy to the line of thought I have so briefly 
sketched. If a Burke could not draw up an indict- 
ment against a great nation, who is likely to have so 
perfect a vision of history as to be able to give the 
lie to a great national conviction ? If I can judge 
from abroad as to the impressions that prevail in the 
United States with respect to the war in Africa, the 
point of view I have indicated deserves attention. 
At all events, it is essential to the appreciation of 
the principal passage which I now offer the reader as 
a fine example of the poetic treatment of a national 
theme. I will not indulge in a trite apology for the 
shortcomings of a translation in which no one will 
expect the direct and inevitable sweep of the original, 
but which at worst is, I hope, a little better than a 
prose version. 

In La Canzone (TOltremare the Italian people is 
addressed as follows by Victory : 

With me toward the burning- Desert speed, 

Toward the sphinxless desert-land with me, 
That waits the foot, the furrow, and the seed, 

With me, O fruitful race, that girdest thee 
To walk upon the ancient ways again 
Leading to selfhood and to destiny, 

With me where warriors to reap remain, 
That in the coronal upon thy brow 
I braid the oaken leaf with bladed grain ! 

Beholdest thou me to-day upon the prow 
Erect in arms, to-morrow I incline 
My knee upon the glebe that waits the plow, 

While bare-brawn legions break the battle-line, 

And beat their spears to pruning-hooks, and fill 
Thy hungry hands with corn, thy vats with wine. 

Too long against the threatened fever-chill 

And threatened sleep, I watched in Ostia dead, 
My face to Tiber-slime reverted still, 

Alone my wakeful bivouac I made 

Between the pillars which the harbor mark, 
That glow at vespertide with fatal red, 



And held my palpitating breath to hark 
If the great shade of some Divinity 
Enter the river-mouth with Fortune's barque. 

Ah, since so long that awful bourne by me 

Was sentinelled, be now my slumber light 
And brief beneath the Arch beyond the sea! 

Gyrene's Grecian dream be mine to-night 
Under the Arch of the wise Emperor 
Rescued from sand and barbarous despite, 

Wide to the triumph, while from every prore 
Shines peace in Latin Tripoli, a train 
Of camels bringing perfumes to her door. 

sacred odors blown across the plain 

From unknown lands to where the ocean lies, 
Frankincense tawny as the lion's mane, 

And wheat and herds and minerals and spice ; 
And Berenice with her golden hair ! 
In shadow of the sword is Paradise. 

Here are the prohibited stanzas from La Canzone 
del Dardanelli: 

But one fears more than all the others : he, 
The executioner angelical, 
The Angel of the eternal gallows-tree. 

gloomy Mantua, Belfiore's wall, 

Ditches of Lombardy, crouching Triest, 
Did ever greater miracle befall ? 

The filthy Eagle of the double crest, 

Who like the vulture vomits from his maw 
Gobbets of corpses he can not digest ! 

Another miracle : they round him draw 

The noose, now spotless girdle, to denote 
The old decrepit hangman's pious awe, 

While every night he dreams he feels his throat 
Clutched by the mutilated jewelled hand 
That stained with blood the pocket of the Croat ! 

The foolish art of censorship has given a prom- 
inence to this bit of satire which it does not in itself 
deserve. One feels the inferiority of d'Annunzio in 
this line I do not say to Dante to Carducci or 
to Leopardi. The allusion to the jewelled female 
hand found in the pocket of a dead Austrian soldier 
is explained in d'Annunzio's commentary. The 
satire, if to the address of old Francis Joseph, is 
almost as ferocious as the deed ! This is not the only 
passage in which the poet, aiming at saeva indignatio, 
degenerates into abusiveness. 

One turns with relief to the sweeping picture of a 
desert battle in the Song of Diana, to the descrip- 
tion of Cagni's polar enterprise, to the many splendid 
historical pictures. One of the most beautiful of 
all is the apostrophe to Genoa about Garibaldi and 
Mazzini in La Canzone del Sangue. 

So between Love and Death the hero stood, 
Embarking with his crew red-garmented, 
While to one soul he fused that brotherhood, 

Nor did he turn again his noble head 

Toward the eternal shore, for fear to miss 
Eurydice whom out of Hell he led. 

And so didst thou, but unaware of this, 
Nurse the pale outlaw of the brow and eye, 
Banished from home without a Beatrice ; 

Who in the languor of that twilight sky, 
Like to a beacon lifted up his woe, 
Like to a banner raised his thought on high, 

And to the flesh, yoke-ridden by the foe, 

Breathed that third breath of life, which every where 
Doth warm us now, and palpitate, and glow.

\ N XALS or A GREAT AMERICAN 

IM i:i.l-m\. HOUSE.* 



It was in 1817 that James and John Harper, 
the two eldest of the four brothers who estab- 
lished the great publishing house now known 
the world over, entered into a partnership under 
the style of J. & J. Harper, and started business 
as printers in a dingy little room in Dover Street, 
New York, where, as their first important piece 
of work, they superintended and largely executed 
in person the printing of Seneca's " Morals " for 
the elder Duyckinck, a bookseller of note in his 
time. The next year Locke's " Essay on the 
Human Understanding " was undertaken inde- 
pendently by the young printers, who first, how- 
ever, secured enough orders from the booksellers 
to warrant the success of the enterprise. 

Such were the beginnings of the " House of 
Harper," whose history is now traced by Mr. 
J. Henry Harper, one of the third generation 
of Harpers at present conducting the business 
handed down from fathers to sons for almost a 
century. The completion of the original quar- 
tet of printer-publishers took place in 1825, 
when Fletcher Harper, the youngest of the four 
brothers, entered the firm, two years after the 
third brother, Joseph Wesley Harper, had cast 
in his lot with the infant establishment. Then 
followed a steady and increasingly rapid develop- 
ment of the business, connections being formed 
with many of our leading writers, and consider- 
able republishing of foreign works being also 
undertaken, with gratifying results to the house. 
Four times within three decades serious fire losses 
were sustained and quickly recovered from, the 
most disastrous calamity of the sort being that 
of 1853 in Pearl and Cliff Streets, where had 
been built the largest and best-equipped plant 
of its kind in the world, that of Brockhaus in 
Leipzig ranking next. The present fire-proof 
buildings, occupying the site of those destroyed, 
were erected with all possible speed after the 
clearing-away of the ruins ; and as temporary 
quarters had meanwhile been secured, the regu- 
lar business of the house was not interrupted 
for a single day. 

Reverting to the foregoing reference to the 
Harpers' republication of English books, one 
finds some interesting notes on the subject in 
an early chapter of Mr. Harper's history, which 

THE HOUHK or HARPER. A Century of Publishing in 
Franklin Square. By J. Henry Harper. With portrait*. 
New York : Harper & Brother*. 



may serve to correct a prevalent false impres- 
sion. Voluntary payments in large sums have 
from the first been made to foreign authors 
whose works were brought out by the Harpers, 
although of course the publishers enjoyed until 
recently no copyright protection in making such 
ventures, and the authors could legally demand 
no royalties. To Dickens Harper & Brothers 
paid 1250 for "Great Expectations, ' to Thack- 
eray 480 for "The Virginians," to Anthony 
Trollope 700 for "Sir Harry Hotspur," and 
to George Eliot prices ranging as high as 1700 
for a single novel. Wilkie Collins, Charles 
Reade, Macaulay, and many other English 
authors were liberally treated by the same house 
in the days before international copyright. The 
author adds that the record-books of many other 
prominent American publishers, some of whom 
he names, would show a similar array of facts 
and figures, and make clear that while. many 
people in this country and England were of the 
opinion that the editions of English books pub- 
lished in this country brought no pecuniary re- 
turn to the authors, the facts were that large 
sums were regularly paid by American pub- 
lishers for the privilege of a few days' priority. 
These arrangements were satisfactory, with few 
exceptions, to English authors, and were usually 
sought by them." 

A most attractive feature of Mr. Harper's 
richly reminiscent book is the part devoted to 
the distinguished authors and editors and other 
literacy or artist workers whose names have be- 
come associated with the Harper firm. Some- 
times these persons are made to tell in part, in 
the form of letters or of especially prepared 
papers, the story of their connection with the 
house. Particularly interesting is the portion 
thus contributed by Mr. Howells, and not less 
welcome is the account of Mr. Henry M. Alden 
from Mr. Harper's pen ; also full of entertain- 
ing recollections are the pages relating to Mark 
Twain, to George William Curtis, to General 
Lew Wallace, to Lafcadio Hearn and William 
Black and Mr. Thomas Hardy and numerous 
others. In Mr. Alden 's own words occurs the 
following brief characterization of the four 
Harper brothers as he first knew them in the 
early sixties: 

" For nearly six yean after my connection with the 
establishment the beautiful association of the four Har- 
per brothers remained unbroken. They were known 
among themselves and their intimates by sobriquets 
whose origin referred to a time far antedating my ac- 
quaintance with them. James was for obvious reason 
known aa 'the Mayor'; John was 'the Colonel '; Joseph 
Wesley 'the Captain'; Fletcher 'the Major.' How

indelible in my memory are the faces of these men and 
their frankly disclosed characters!" 

Of the good old-fashioned business methods 
of these gentlemen some pleasing glimpses are 
given. The subjoined anecdote, illustrating 
Fletcher Harper's winning manner in his daily 
routine, is here in place : 

"Frederick Halpin was one of the last of the old 
steel-plate portrait engravers. He frequently did work 
for the House, which was always in the highest degree 
satisfactory. He had the artistic temperament, was 
gentle, modest and unobtrusive in manner. One day he 
brought in a portrait which he had engraved for the 
House, and it was taken to Mr. Fletcher Harper, who 
looked over the proof of the portrait very carefully. 
Turning to Halpin, he said most pleasantly, ' It is a 
very fine piece of work, Mr. Halpin ; what is your bill ?' 
Halpin said very modestly, as if almost ashamed to 
mention the sum, ' One hundred and fifty dollars.' 'Is 
that all?' said Mr. Harper; 'I wish for your sake it 
was more,' and he immediately paid the bill. Of course 
this is a small circumstance, but it is not always that 
successful business men meet demands upon them in 
the same cordial, encouraging spirit." 

Fletcher Harper, by the way, was the grand- 
father of Mr. J. Henry Harper, and not unnat- 
urally many instances are cited of his conspicuous 
ability as the head of the literary department of 
the business and supervisor of its work in illus- 
tration and of other details having to do with the 
artistic side of printing and publishing. But the 
other brothers also are shown in their character- 
istic traits. For example, of the eldest, we read : 

"James Harper in many respects reminds one of 
Abraham Lincoln, or rather of what Lincoln would prob- 
ably have been had a less heavy burden been laid upon 
his shoulders. There was the same keen sense of humor, 
the same fondness for jokes and witticisms, and the 
same readiness in finding or making an anecdote pat to 
the purpose. James's favorite way was to father his joke 
upon the person to whom he was speaking. Apropos of 
anything that came up he would say, ' That puts me in 
mind of what you told me once,' and then would come 
some story most likely invented on the spot. ' Why ! 
Mr. Harper,' would come the response, 'I never told 
you that; in fact, I never heard it before.' ' It is quite 
possible,' would be the rejoinder, 'but if it was not you 
it must have been somebody else,' and then would prob- 
ably come another story." 

"A keener judge of character I never knew," 
says one of his old friends. " While apparently 
joking with a man, he was taking his measure, 
and in this he was rarely mistaken. If he thought 
him trustworthy there was no limit to his friend- 
liness, not merely in word, but in act." 

Mr. Howells's account of his connection with 
the Harpers should be read and enjoyed in its 
entirety. Near its close he says, in reference 
to the firm's reorganization of a dozen years ago 
and the placing of its affairs under the able 
management of Colonel Harvey : 

" Since then I have remained attached to the House 



of Harper & Brothers, with no desire for any other 
business relations. As there is some superstition to the 
contrary, and authors and publishers are supposed to be 
natural enemies, I think I may properly testify here to 
the friendship which has always existed between my 
publishers and myself. I do not believe the instance is 
uncommon, at least in America, though I have heard 
terrible things about authors and publishers in England, 
while from my own Scotch publishers I have constantly 
experienced a consideration worthy of Franklin Square 
in the past and in the present." 

Mark Twain, of whom some characteristic 
anecdotes are told in the book, regretted in later 
years that he had not assumed two pseudonyms, 
one for humorous and the other for serious pro- 
ductions. His historical and sociological study, 
" The Prince and the Pauper," was written, he 
himself declared, in entire seriousness and after 
months of careful reading-up on the period in 
which the little Prince and his Pauper double 
were supposed to have lived. But it was no use ; 
the signature "Mark Twain" proved the ruin of 
the book as a sober and earnest piece of work. 
Hence the anonymity of his next attempt in sim- 
ilar vein, "Joan of Arc." "And did any of 
these literary highbrows suggest in all their 
ravings that it was a book of humor? " asks the 
author. " Well, I guess not ! Mark Twain at 
last stood for something more than mere tom- 
foolery." 

Mention must not be omitted of the chapter 
devoted to the cartoonist Nast and his part in 
breaking up the notorious Tweed Ring. The 
New York " Times," with Louis J. Jennings in 
the editorial chair and George Jones to back 
him up as proprietor of the paper, and "Har- 
per's Weekly," with the genius of Nast in its 
service, fought mightily and effectively for mu- 
nicipal reform; and Mr. Harper's account of 
the campaign is good reading, and shows the 
House of Harper as a valiant champion of the 
right. 

The last chapter of the book, except the 
brief " Conclusion," contains a full and eulo- 
gistic review of the business activity of Colonel 
George Harvey, the present president of the 
Harper corporation, and a many-sided genius 
whose commercial acumen and administrative 
ability promise well for the increasing future 
prosperity of the great publishing house under 
his direction. If its second century of achieve- 
ment shall prompt some yet unborn Harper to 
produce as excellent and gratifying a record of 
progress as that just put forth in so handsome 
a form, with so much of literary charm, and so 
appropriately and richly illustrated, there will 
be only one thing to regret, that we cannot be 
there to read it. PERCY F. BICKNELL.

THB MORAL. HISTORY OF OUR TARIFF.* 

In all American history it would be difficult 
to find an issue which has been more persistently 
before the public than that of the tariff. The 
chief difference between the demand for protec- 
tion to-day and that of a century or more ago 
is that when Alexander Hamilton was advocat- 
ing this policy the infant manufactures thought 
themselves fortunate if they could secure duties 
of five to fifteen per cent, while now these in- 
fants have attained such growth and propor- 
tions that nothing less than a duty averaging at 
least fifty per cent will satisfy the cravings of 
their hunger and keep them alive at least so 
they tell us. Perhaps this is one reason why 
the problem has attained such prominence of 
late. At any rate we may be sure that before 
the current year is over we shall all have heard 
a great deal about the tariff. Hence we may wel- 
come the appearance in book form of the articles 
on that subject which Miss Tarbell originally 
contributed to " The American Magazine." 

The volume is chiefly welcome, however, be- 
cause it treats the topic from a point of view 
unlike that of most previous writers. On the 
economic side of the question we already have 
Professor Taussig's authoritative work. Others 
have dealt with its political history. But in the 
book before us still another phase of the subject 
is developed, and it is one which much needs 
attention. To quote the author herself, here " is 
an attempt to tell in narrative form the story of 
this defeat of the popular will," since, " as far 
as the tariff has been concerned public opinion 
has never been fairly embodied in the bills 
adopted." Had this popular will been followed 
" there would be to-day no duties on iron and 
steel products, on cheap cottons and cotton mix- 
tures, and certainly none on a great variety of 
raw materials probably including raw wool." 
The reason is that in these cases and many 
others either the purposes of protection have 
been realized or it has been proved that they 
never could be realized, and in either instance 
the duty should be withdrawn. Some readers 
will be inclined to doubt whether the author 
has gone into the question as to the economic 
effects of the tariff with sufficient thoroughness 
entirely to fulfil this promise. What she has 
given us is rather a story of how the tariff is 
actually made, a description of how private bar- 
gaining, special interests, lobbying and political 
wire-pulling, rather than economic principles, 

THB TARIFF IK OUR TIMES. By Ida M. Tarbell. New 
York: The Macnnllan Co. 



have in fact determined the actual construction 
of our tariff schedules; in short, it is what we 
may call the moral history of the tariff. Such. 
indeed, in the end, serins to !> the author's own 
conclusion, for in the last chapter we find her 
writing: "Simmered down to its final essence 
the tariff question as it stands in this country 
to-day is a question of national morals, a ques- 
tion of the kind of men it is making." And 
we must add that the evidence here adduced is 
only too convincing. 

Miss Tarbell *s narrative begins with the Civil 
War, the period which marks such an abrupt 
change in our tariff legislation. A glance at 
the preceding years shows that with the first 
strong demand for fairly high protection, which 
came after the War of 1812, several sorts of 
manufactures secured duties ranging from fif- 
teen to thirty per cent. The demand continu- 
ing, the duties were raised from time to time, 
the movement culminating in the famous Tariff 
of Abominations " of 1 8 28 . From then on , until 
1860, the trend of duties in all the tariff acts 
but that of 1842 was steadily downward, partly 
due to the growing opposition and influence of 
the South, partly to the fact that manufactures 
seemed to progress in spite of the reductions. 
On the outbreak of the Civil War the govern- 
ment naturally turned to the tariff, since from 
the first customs duties had been the chief source 
of revenue. Throughout the war rates were rap- 
idly advanced, so that the average rate on duti- 
able commodities in 1864 was forty-seven per 
cent as compared with about twenty per cent in 
1860. But the really significant fact is that 
these high rates, which everyone assumed to be 
simply temporary, which, in fact, could never 
have been obtained but for the pressure of a 
great crisis, not only were not appreciably re- 
duced, generally speaking, after the war (the 
revenue duties excepted), but in more recent 
years have actually been still further increased, 
till in 1897, on the passage of the Dingley Tariff, 
the country reached a level of duties averaging 
fifty-seven per cent, the highest in our history. 
One might almost infer that the longer we had 
a tariff the more we needed it. At least the 
situation is bound to arouse one's curiosity and 
to lead to the inquiry, how is it possible to bring 
about a trend of affairs so diametrically the oppo- 
site of what we might reasonably expect? This is 
what Miss Tarbell tries to explain, and the nar- 
rative, vividly told and full of the human ele- 
ment, is as interesting as it is illuminating. 

A typical example of tariff-making is fur- 
nished by the now famous wool and woolens 



1912.] 



THE DIAL

schedule. The interests of the growers and 
manufacturers of wool are naturally absolutely 
opposed so far as concerns the price of wool. 
The manufacturers, however, are willing to work 
for a duty on wool which will raise the price of 
that product provided the growers will in turn 
lend their political support to secure a duty on 
manufactures of wool. But inasmuch as the 
cost of the manufacturer's raw material has been 
increased he very reasonably demands, and gets, 
in addition to the protective duty on his cloth, a 
compensating duty to offset the increased cost 
of his wool. Back in 1867 the manufacturer 
declared that twenty-five per cent net protection 
was all that he needed, but now he is obtaining 
much more; while it may be noted, incidentally, 
that the compensating duty is adjusted on a 
basis which generally much more than offsets 
the duty on raw wool and thus really affords 
just so much additional protection. Sometimes 
a schedule is shaped by give-and-take bargain- 
ing of this sort, at other times it is chiefly deter- 
mined by the insistent demands of one person, 
as when Senator Sherman practically held up 
the whole Republican Party for a higher duty 
on pig iron, or when Wharton got his duty on 
nickel, or Whitman his duty on wool-tops. The 
extent to which this may go is well illustrated 
by the tariff-making of 1894, at which time one 
senator after another threatened to prevent any 
legislation until his particular duties were 
granted, the result leading Tom Reed to declare 
that the bill was " framed upon the broad bed- 
rock foundation of the necessities of securing 
forty-three votes, and all minor considerations 
had to give way to this great underlying princi- 
ple." Thus it always happened that, in one or 
another of these ways, the interests of certain 
individuals or sections won out, while economic 
principles, even those of scientific protection, 
were no less completely ignored than the desires 
of the party or the well-being of the people as a 
whole. 

But when the author turns from the ethics of 
tariff-making to some of the economic aspects of 
the problem the treatment is less satisfactory. 
The conclusions concerning the economic effects 
of the duties need a considerably more accurate 
and keenly analytical study, and there is fre- 
quent evidence of the common tendency to exag- 
gerate the tariff's influence. For example, it is 
implied that the tariff is largely responsible for 
the conditions which exist in the mills of Rhode 
Island and the evils shown by the Pittsburg 
Survey. Would that this were so ! for then we 
could find in its removal a panacea of such power 



as the most hopeful social worker has seldom 
dreamed. These evils are, alas ! far more deeply 
rooted than the tariff, and their removal infi- 
nitely more difficult and complicated. It is to be 
wished that such exaggeration had been avoided, 
but a volume intended to arouse people on an 
important moral issue should not be seriously 
criticized on these grounds. A narrative of this 
character is much more likely to catch the public 
eye and accomplish the desired result than the 
painstaking analysis of the carefully trained 
economist, important as such an analysis may 
be in its place. 

Finally, let it be noted that one who believes 
in scientific protection may condemn the methods 
of tariff -making here portrayed quite as sincerely 
as one who believes in free trade. It is not until 
all the people are keenly conscious of the evils 
which have grown up in connection with these 
methods that the country can hope to secure that 
scientific tariff, be it protective or for revenue 
only, for which everyone so strongly hopes. In 
securing such a tariff this book should prove a 
powerful aid.

RE-ENTER DOCTOR JOHXSON.* 

So firm a hold on us has the rugged personality 
of Samuel Johnson that his is still a name to con- 
jure with. How odd it is that this grotesquely 
unromantic figure should periodically issue forth 
with an irresistible appeal to the romantic side 
of our imagination. When in doubt, intro- 
duce Dr. Johnson this is warrantable advice to 
the searcher for literary types or themes. And 
once again we welcome with responsive interest 
the latest re-appearance of the honest, irascible, 
sententious old dictator in the very entertaining 
volume compiled by Professor Tinker. 

Is the Johnsonian tradition the creation of 
Boswell, as Macaulay implied, or is it rather 
due to the dominating personality of Johnson

son who made Boswell great. It is not possible 
to discover Johnson's greatness in his literary 
work ; it is evident that he represents more than 
he achieved in his books "that he stimulated 
more than he wrote." This is the idea. 

It is the sturdy vigor of this personality, its

quick anticipation when the old lion enters? To 
meet with Johnson, we are accustomed to go to 
BOB well; and our visits with the Doctor are likely 
to begin and end with these excursions. Some 
of us may have the habit, like a certain Pres- 
byterian pastor of scholarly taste and human in- 
stincts who once said in a moment of confidential 
fellowship : " I keep my Boswell on my study 
table and usually read a passage from it before 
retiring." But it is good to be reminded that 
the faithful Scotchman is not the only contem- 
porary chronicler of the sayings and doings of 
Samuel Johnson. The diary and letters of 
Fanny Burney are rich in something more than 
mere reminiscence : here are dramatic sketches, 
amazingly vivid and at full length. She met 
Dr. Johnson first in 1777, in her father's house. 
Fanny's sisters were playing a duet when the 
great man was announced. 

lit- is indeed very ill-favoured; is tall and stout; but 
stoops terribly; he is almost bent double. His mouth 
is almost continually opening and shutting, as if he was 
chewing. He has a strange method of frequently twirl- 
ing his fingers, and twisting his hands. His body is in 
continual agitation, see-sawing up and down; his feet are 
never a moment quiet; and, in short, his whole person 
is in perpetual motion. His dress, too, considering the 
times, and that he had meant to put on his best becomes, 
being engaged to dine in a large company, was as much 
out of the common road as his figure; he had a large 
wig, snuff-color coat, and gold buttons, but no ruffles to 
his shirt, doughty [dirty?] fists, and black worsted 
stockings. He is shockingly near-sighted, and did not, 
till she held out her hand to him, even know Mrs. Thrale. 
He poked his nose over the keys of the harpsichord, till 
the duet was finished, and then my father introduced 
Hetty to him as an old acquaintance, and he cordially 
kissed her ! " 

And the writer goes on to say that as they were 
in the library, the Doctor's attention was at once 
drawn to the books, from which he could not be 
diverted. Poring over them shelf by shelf , almost 
touching their backs with his eye-lashes, he at 
last fixed upon one and began without further 
ceremony to read to himself ; when the company 
adjourned to the drawing-room he entered into 
the conversation. 

In the summer of 1778 Miss Burney made 
her first visit with Mrs. Thrale at Streatham, a 
visit made memorable as the occasion of her inti- 
mate acquaintance with Johnson. She was not 
yet publicly known as the author of " Evelina," 
which was then being read and praised by every- 
body, but Mrs. Thrale was in the secret and con- 
fidentially imparted it to the dictator, who had 
himself been beguiled into reading the novel. To 
the infinite delight of the young author, John- 
son had nothing but praise for Evelina " and 
admiration for Miss Burney ; and from the hour 



of their acquaintance to that of his death he was 
her admirer and friend. The little gallantries 
of speech and conduct which attended his kind- 
ness to the novelist are set forth most amusingly 
in the journal. 

" After supper, Dr. Johnson turned the discourse 
upon silent folks whether by way of reflection and i - 
proof, or by accident, I know not; but I do know he is 
provoked with me for not talking more ; and I was afraid 
he was seriously provoked ; but, a little while ago, I went 
into the music-room where he was tete-a-tete with Mrs. 
Thrale, and calling me to him, he took my hand, and 
made me sit next him, in a manner that seeinrd truly 
affectionate. 

" Sir,' cried I, ' I was much afraid I was going out of 
your favor t ' 

" ' Why so ? What should make you think so ? ' 

'Why, I don't know my silence, I believe. I be- 
gan to fear you would give me up.' 

"No, my darling ! my dear little Burney, no. When 
I give you up ' 

" What then, sir?' cried Mrs. Thrale. 

" Why, I do n't know; for whoever could give her up 
would deserve worse than I can say; 1 know not what 
would be bad enough.' 

Now for this morning's breakfast. 

Dr. Johnson, as usual, came hist into the library ; he 
was in high spirits, and full of mirth and sport. I had 
the honor of sitting next to him ; and now, all at once, 
he flung aside his reserve, thinking, perhaps, that it was 
time I should fling aside mine. 

"Mrs. Thrale told him that she intended taking me to 
Mr. T 's. 

" So you ought, madam,' cried he ; 4 't is your business 
to be Cicerone to her.' 

"Then suddenly he snatched my hand, and kissing it, 
Ah ! ' he added, ' they will little think what a Tartar 
you carry to them ! ' 

"'No, that .they won't!' cried Mrs. Thrale; 'Miss 
Burney looks so meek and so quiet, nobody would sus- 
pect what a comical girl she is; but I believe she has a 
great deal of malice at heart.' 

" 'Oh, she 's a toad,' cried the doctor, laughing ' a sly 
young rogue t with her Smiths and her Branghtons ! ' " 

Miss Burney evidently put her powers of 
dramatic interpretation to as vigorous and happy 
use in these intimate accounts as she did in de- 
lineating the characters in her novels. Usually 
the dialogue is thoroughly vivacious; occasion- 
ally it is altogether Johnsonese in its formality. 

" Mrs. Thrale. ' Your compliments, sir, are made 
seldom, but when they are made they have an elegance 
unequalled ; but then when you are angry, who dares 
make speeches so bitter and cruel?' 

" Dr. J. ' Madame, I am always sorry when I mnke 
bitter speeches, and 1 never do it but when I am insuf- 
ferably vexed.' " 

Quite typical is the scene described by Miss 
Burney as occurring at :i party jiv'i 1>\ Mr-. 
Thrale at Brighthelmstone, wherein the old dic- 
tator has a characteristic encounter this time 
with Mr. William Pepys. 

" Wit being talked of, Mr. Pepys repeated,

" ' True wit is nature to advantage dress'd, 

What oft was thought, but ne'er so well expres'd ! ' 

" < That, sir,' cried Dr. Johnson, < is a definition both 
false and foolish. Let wit be dressed how it will, it will 
be equally wit, and neither the more nor the less for any 
advantage dress can give it.' 

"Mr. P. ' But, sir, may not wit be so ill expressed, 
and so obscure, by a bad speaker, as to be lost? ' 

" Dr. J. The fault, then, sir, must be with the 
hearer. If a man cannot distinguish wit from words, he 
little deserves to hear it.' 

" Mr. P. < But, sir, what Pope means ' 

" Dr. J. ' Sir, what Pope means, if he means what he 
says, is both false and foolish. In the first place, " what 
oft was thought," is all the worse for being often thought, 
because to be wit, it ought to be newly thought.' 

" Mr. P. ' But, sir, 't is the expression that makes it 
new.' 

" Dr. J. ' How can the expression make it new ? 
It may make it clear, or may make it elegant ; but how 
new? You are confounding words with things.' 

" Mr. P. ' But, sir, if one man says a thing very ill, 
may not another man say it so much better that ' 

" Dr. J. That other man, sir, deserves but small 
praise for the amendment; he is but the tailor to the 
first man's thoughts.' 

" Mr. P. ' True, sir, he may be the tailor; but then 
the difference is as great as between a man in a gold 
lace suit and a man in a blanket.' 

"Dr. J. 'Just so, sir, I thank you for that: the 
difference is precisely such, since it consists neither in 
the gold lace suit nor the blanket, but in the man by 
whom they are worn.' 

"This was the summary; the various contemptuous 
sarcasms intermixed would fill, and very unpleasantly, 
a quire." 

There are some two hundred pages of this 
material thus brought together in an arrange- 
ment approximately chronological. Forty addi- 
tional pages contain further allusions to John- 
son found in Miss Burney's later memoirs of 
her father. " It is remarkable," says the edi- 
tor, " that no such volume has appeared before ; 
for, apart from Boswell, there is no account of 
Samuel Johnson more lifelike and picturesque 
than Miss Burney's. Yet although practi- 
cally all the other Johnsonian material has 
been edited with scrupulous care, Miss Burney's 
account has been allowed to remain scattered 
through the pages of two voluminous diaries 
and hidden in the now-forgotten 'Memoirs of 
Dr. Burney.' " 

The reader of this volume will echo the senti- 
ment. He will, indeed, find it difficult to take 
leave of the volume until he has finished it. It 
contains more than it promises; for while the 
ponderous figure of the great Samuel, awkwardly 
see-sawing in its chair, dominates every scene, 
there are a dozen brilliant notabilities of the 
day joining in the discourse and listening In 
varied moods for the pregnant " Sir! " of the 
oracle. Here sits Lady Mary Montague, some- 



what stiffly on this occasion; for she and the 
Doctor have had their falling out. Here come 
Burke and Reynolds to pay their compliments 
to Fanny; here, too, for once at least comes 
Boswell, surprised to find that the chair at his 
hero's elbow is reserved for another; and there 
is Mrs. Thrale, and many lesser lights who re- 
flect, at least, the brightness of the few. Last 
but not least, sharing the centre of the stage, 
self-conscious but hardly less captivating now 
than then, is little Burney herself. " Whoever 
could give her up would deserve worse than I 
could say ; I know not what would be bad 
enough!" So said the Doctor; and we say

THE ART OF INDIA.* 



" Undoubtedly the most significant fact in 
modern Western art is that artists, dimly con- 
scious of the limitations which the narrow con- 
ventions of the Italian Renaissance have so long 
imposed upon them, have been looking for 
many years once more to the East for new 
ideas and new sources of inspiration." 

With this ingenious and ingenuous ming- 
ling of truth and error, Mr. E. B. Havell begins 
his exposition of " The Ideals of Indian Art."' 
It is without doubt of the highest significance 
that art lovers in the West are in steadily in- 
creasing numbers finding spiritual refreshment 
in the art of the Far East, and are beginning to 
realize that the message it holds is one of prime 
importance. But it is our art lovers rather than 
our artists (who may be art lovers, but seldom 
are in the broad sense in which the term is here 
used) who are thus turning to the East. Of the 
artists only a few of the more thoughtful are so 
doing, and they are more than dimly conscious 
of the stifling effect of the false standards to 
which most of their fellows are committed, and 
from which they find it extremely difficult to 
break away. Had their revolt begun many 
years ago, as Mr. Havell implies, it is fair to 
presume that the results as shown in their work 
would be much more pronounced than they have 
as yet become. As a class our artists are not 
very impressionable. Modern training does not 
conduce to this. It might be supposed that of 
all men they would be the quickest to recognize 
merit in any work of art, however strange its 
form. Instead the effect of the neo-romautic 
individualism in which most of them are steeped,

and of the habit of concentrating their attention 
upon scientific problems of realistic representa- 
tion, is that from paintings and sculpture con- 
ceived in a spirit different from that to which 
they are accustomed they turn away unmoved. 
And Far Eastern art works in particular are 
likely to mean little or nothing to them because 
they do not understand them. 

The wider public outside the studios is for 
the most part ignorant of art, and either echoes 
the artists' views, or, in looking at works of art, 
sees only the subject matter. Still on the whole, 
the public is more receptive of new ideas than 
the artists are, and it includes a group of de- 
voted students who have performed a service of 
inestimable value to the advancement of art by 
their efforts to make the art of the East widely 
known and appreciated for the vital thing it is. 
Mr. Havell, though an artist, should be counted 
in this group. He was for some years the 
principal of the Government School of Art in 
Calcutta, and it is due to his initiative and per- 
severance that Indian students have abandoned 
the attempt to master European methods and 
have been induced to resume their native tra- 
ditions in art, with most encouraging results as 
shown in the work of his pupils and notably in 
that of Mr. Tagore. As director of the Calcutta 
Art Gallery, also, Mr. Havell performed true 
knight's service for the recognition of Indian 
art. Four years ago be published his " Indian 
Sculpture and Painting." This was a pioneer 
work. Not enough is known about the histor- 
ical development of art in India to afford mate- 
rial for more than an incomplete sketch. What 
he accomplished was to give an idea of the scope 
and character of the creative arts of painting 
and sculpture as practised in India from ancient 
times, and to tell of the existence of a much 
larger remnant of notable works than were gen- 
erally known. His attempt to interpret the aims 
and ideals of the artists was less successful. His 
enthusiasm did not meet with quite the response 
from the critics that he seems to have expected, 
and partly in reply to their exceptions to what 
they regarded as over-statements and partly to 
fill in "particulars necessarily omitted," he 
again addresses himself to the public in a work 
which may in a sense be considered supple- 
mental to the earlier book. 

In Indian idealism Mr. Havell finds "the 
key to the understanding, not only of all Asiatic 
art but of that of the Christian art of the Middle 
Ages." Baldly stated, this means that not only 
Indian art but a large part of European art 
should be viewed as the exponent of religious 



emotion. The author does not leave us in doubt 
as to where he stands. 

"The true aim of the arti-t i* not to extract Ix-auty 
from nature, but to reveal the Life within life, the 
Noumenon within phenomenon, Ae Reality within un- 
reality, and the Soul within matter. When that is re- 
vealed, beauty reveals itself. So all nature is beautiful 
for us, if only we can realize the Divine Idea within it. 
There if nothing common or unclean in what God has 
made, but we can only make life beautiful for ourselves 
by the power of the spirit that is within us. Therefore 
it is, as the sage Sukracharya says, that, in making 
images of the gods, the artist should depend upon spirit- 
ual vision only, and not upon the appearance of ol > 
perceived by human senses." 

It may be that the cultivation of this faculty of 
spiritual vision was 

the main endeavor of the Indian artist in the golden 
age of Indian art and literature . . . when the immortal 
Hindu epics, the Ram ay ana and the Mahabharata, were 
moulded into their present form ; when the poet Kalidasa 
sang at the court of King Vikrama; and when the sc-nlp- 
tors of Elephanta and Kllora hewed out of stupendous 
masses of living rock their visions of the gods throned 
in their Himalayan paradise," 

though one suspects that Mr. Havell draws 
somewhat upon his imagination in making this 
statement, as he does also when he goes back to 
the Vedic age for the origin of Indian art, and 
asserts that it " was conceived when that wonder- 
ful intuition flashed upon the Indian mind that 
the soul of man is eternal and one with the Su- 
preme Soul, the Lord and Creator of all things." 
Without doubt the content of Indian art is 
not intelligible unless interpreted in the light 
of Indian religion and philosophy. And in the 
principle insisted upon in the ritual of the Indian 
yogin, that it is necessary for the artist to identify 
himself absolutely with his subject, there is a 
measure of truth, for an artist can express only 
what he feels. But it cannot be too often pointed 
out that art is not the thing said but the manner 
of saying. Though the artists who produced the 
great religious paintings and sculptures were 
believers, and may even have been fiery zealots, 
the force that quickened the creative impulse 
and inspired the masterpieces was not religious 
emotion but love of the work itself, or, in other 
words, the desire of the artist soul for self- 
expression. Religious fervor alone never brought 
forth a work of art. Its tendency is rather to 
turn the artist from his art. Indeed it would 
seem not improbable that herein lies at least a 
partial explanation of the fact that in India art 
did not reach the full development it attains! in 
China and Japan, though it was India that gave 
those lands the "kindling ideals and imagery" 
that spurred them onward, and that have domi- 
nated the thought of all eastern Asia.

Blinded by excess of devotion, Mr. Havell 
refuses to concede that Indian art is inferior to 
that of Japan or China. He insists that the 
whole essence of Asiatic art-creation lies in " the 
inner informing spirit," and that our relative 
estimate should rest upon the extent to which 
"the original creative thought-power" in India 
has acted upon that of the countries to which it 
was carried. 

We need only turn to the illustrations in this 
volume to be convinced that the claims of Indian 
art do not have to be bolstered up by such spe- 
cial pleading. Very splendid are many of the 
works shown in these excellent photographic 
reproductions. Their artistic worth is quite 
apparent, even to those without knowledge of 
the religious ideas they embody. While we 
may not in every instance be able to go as far 
as Mr. Havell does in his enthusiastic commen- 
dation, we should feel grateful to him for bring- 
ing these works to our attention. In some of 
his theories he asks us to recast our ideas of the 
psychology of art production, as when he sug- 
gests that the abnormally slow development of 
the technic arts in the Indian civilization was 
deliberately willed. But the task of the pio- 
neer in this field is not a light one. Mr. Havell 
has approached it in a catholic spirit and with 
an open mind, and he has the needful equip- 
ment of profound knowledge of Indian thought 
and acquaintance with Indian literature. His 
presentation of the ideals that have found ex- 
pression in Indian art could not be clearer. He 
is a forceful writer, and did he not mistake the 
message of art, which is not religious but 
aesthetic, we should have little fault to find with 
his book, which is interesting and stimulating 
throughout. FREDERICK W. GOOKIN. 



STUDIES IN AMERICAN HISTORY.* 

Mr. Charles Francis Adams's collection of 
" Studies Military and Diplomatic " comprises 
ten historical essays, each bearing out the 
author's reputation for vigorous writing, origin- 
ality, and accuracy. Of the eight chapters de- 
voted to military history, three treat of battles, 
Bunker Hill, Long Island, and New Orleans. 
Two others, " Washington and Cavalry " and 
" The Revolutionary Campaign of 1777," throw 
further light on the Revolutionary period; 
while " Some Phases of the Civil War," " The 
Ethics of Secession," and " Lee's Centennial "

treat of the later and, to many, the more interest- 
ing contest. The two last-named were public 
addresses, both delivered in the South, the 
last upon the occasion of the centennial celebra- 
tion of the birth of General Lee, at Washington 
and Lee University. The two remaining papers, 
both again concerned with the Civil War, offer 
instructive and destructive enlightenment upon 
the diplomacy of that trying time. Entitled 
" An Historical Residuum " and " Queen Vic- 
toria and the Civil War," each states a widely 
known and generally accepted historical tradi- 
tion which the author convincingly shows to be 
unfounded. To be sure, there is little save 
negative evidence, but there is sufficient of that 
to dispose conclusively of the story. 

In the first essay, " The Battle of Bunker 
Hill," the author proves conclusively that the 
entire affair was replete with " gross military 
blundering on both sides." In choice of posi- 
tion, arrangements before the battle, and mili- 
tary tactics, each commander was repeatedly at 
fault, while in every case the luck was all on the 
American side. This is not a new view of the 
battle, as Mr. Adams himself states, for the mis- 
takes of that day were clear to contemporaries 
and were catalogued and analyzed by military 
writers of the time. They have, however, been 
lost sight of in a vanishing perspective, and a 
romantic worship of Revolutionary heroes has 
created a fiction of superior generalship, a tradi- 
tion which later generations have accepted as 
unquestioned. The one remarkable feature of 
the battle, as of others in the Revolutionary 
War, was the resourcefulness of the American 
soldier in improvising hasty yet effective en- 
trenchments. This, says Mr. Adams, was a 
new departure in warfare long neglected by 
European armies, though to-day a matter of 
careful instruction. The blunders of Prescott 
on June 17, 1775, were counterbalanced by the 
greater military stupidity of Gage and Howe. 
But Prescott's men at least proved that the 
shovel and pick were implements of war, and, 
as Putnam sagely remarked, " the Yankee as a 
soldier was peculiar, not seeming to care much 
about his head, but dreadfully afraid of his 
shins ; cover him half-leg high, and you could 
depend on him to fight." Prescott, Mr. Adams 
writes, did not realize the lesson his soldiers 
had taught, " and apparently it took almost a 
century for the professional soldier to master 
the fact thoroughly ; but those light, temporary 
earthworks, scientifically thrown up on Bunker 
Hill in the closing hours of a single June night, 
introduced a new element into the defensive tac-

tics of the battle-field. Its final demonstration 
was at Plevna, a whole century later." 

While fully recognizing the military ability 
displayed by Washington in the later years of 
the Revolution, Mr. Adams maintains in several 
essays that Washington, like all other American 
generals, had to learn the art of war, and that 
in the earlier years his management of the army 
was often defective. The battle of Long Island 
is cited in particular as an illustration of bad 
judgment and poor tactics, the Americans being 
saved by the " stupidity and dilatoriness of the 
enemy" and being blessed by an " amazing 
run of pure luck." It is pointed out also that 
it was long before the effectiveness of cavalry 
as a scouting and feeling arm of the service was 
understood. Both Americans and British were 
at fault here, the former not seeming to under- 
stand the importance of organizing a cavalry 
force, and the latter not utilizing that which 
they had. 

In still another essay, treating of effective war- 
fare, but this time referring to the Civil War, the 
author criticizes the historian Rhodes for under- 
rating, or at least for under-stating, the tremen- 
dous value to the North of a greatly superior 
naval force. The blockade, writes Mr. Adams, 
when one seeks for the chief cause of Northern 
victory, outweighed all other advantages com- 
bined, and was indeed the final compelling force 
whose enveloping embrace the South could not 
escape. 

A distinct grasp and full recognition of the advan- 
tage in the struggle pertaining to the mastery of the 
sea is one of the most noticeable deficiencies in Mr. 
Rhodes's treatment of the outcome of the conflict. In 
this respect his narrative is lacking in a proper sense of 
proportion. As compared with the space devoted to 
the movements on land, he fails to give to the sea opera- 
tions the emphasis properly belonging to them." 

In Mr. Adams's opinion an examination of 
conditions giving the North an advantage sim- 
mers down to " one factor, the blockade, as the 
controlling condition of Union success. In other 
words, that success was made possible by the un- 
disputed naval and maritime supremacy of the 
national government. Cut off from the outer 
world and all exterior sources of supply, reduced 
to a state of inanition by the blockade, the Con- 
federacy was pounded to death." 

While historical writers generally have appre- 
ciated the blockade as a weapon, and have ad- 
mitted the immense value to the North of its 
naval supremacy, few, hitherto, have ranked it 
as of the first importance. However, the block- 
ade in the Civil War has yet to !> invrsti^atni 
with thoroughness. There has been no study of 



its influence upon industry within the South, or 
upon trade (save the cotton trade) of foreign 
nations. The picturesque and dramatic features 
of the blockade have had adequate description, 
but there remains the question, What did it 
really mean, not only for the South indeed, l>ut 
for the great neutral nations? 

It is possible that the military essays will 
appeal more to the general reader than the two 
which discuss diplomacy. The studies of cam- 
paigns and battles and the lifelike portraits of 
our great military figures permit an imrompli- 
cated, straightforward narration, which the au- 
thor's facile pen makes unfailingly interesting. 
It inevitably holds the reader's attention, even 
though scholarly investigation has obliged the 
writer to tone down the lights and shadows, and 
sometimes to lay bare a misfortune or a deficiency 
of which the general public has been spared the 
knowledge. Nevertheless, the two studies in 
diplomatic history, though more difficult of nar- 
ration, should also prove keenly interesting. To 
any with a predilection for a well-constructed 
detective story, the skill with which the crime of 
historical mis-statement is unravelled will chal- 
lenge the closest attention ; while to the histo- 
rian, these essays have an additional value, being 
based in all probability on the unpublished diary 
of the writer's father. This invaluable journal 
of America's ablest representative in Europe 
during the Civil War has been in the keeping of 
his son, the present essayist, for many years. It 
is undoubtedly a repository of unguessed richness 
to the historical seeker, and evidence based upon 
such a source is of unquestioned authenticity. 

The essays further show clearly the fallibility 
of recollections the unreliability of memory 
unsupported by exact records, even when the 
reputation and integrity of the writer are beyond 
doubt. Well within this category should come 
the " Recollections of President Lincoln and 
his Administration," published in 1890 by Mr. 
L. E. Chittenden, Register of the Treasury in 
186 l-1865,andafterthata lawyer in New York. 
In a chapter devoted to the Laird Rams, then 
building in England for the Confederacy, Mr. 
Chittenden recounts chronologically, and often 
dramatically, the events in England and America 
leading to his summons to the White House in 
1862, and the demand then made upon him that 
he prepare ten million United States five-twenty 
coupon bonds to be ready for shipment to Great 
Britain in less than three days. This device was 
urged by our Minister at London, who it seems 
had sent a special messenger to Washington and

used by the Confederacy in breaking the block- 
ade ; Southern agents were busy in London, and 
the need of prompt action by the United States 
government was evident. The efforts of the 
American Minister had succeeded in having a 
restraining order issued against the Rams, but 
the order was void unless the United States 
could make an indemnity deposit of 1,000,000 
sterling. To meet this emergency the bonds 
were essential. Such is the bare skeleton of a 
story very entertainingly, even convincingly, 
told by the ex-Register of the Treasury, who 
speaks with the authority of a participant even 
a star actor in the drama. In effect, Mr. Chit- 
tenden is the "only living survivor" of secret 
and mysterious happenings ; and in breaking 
silence after thirty years he omits no vivid detail, 
recalling clearly the various steps taken, from 
Minister Adams's instigation of the plan to his 
own physical exhaustion in signing the bonds. 
The "Historical Residuum" remaining after the 
present author's searching investigation has 
failed to corroborate most of the points of the 
story, and can be summed up in his own words: 
"The amount involved and the number of bonds 
returned to the Treasury were alone accurately 
stated." The other real facts behind the 
Chittenden narrative were brought out in the 
publication in 1898 of the letters of John 
Murray Forbes, one of two men who, under 
wholly different instructions and conditions, 
were in 1863 (not 1862) secretly commissioned 
to go to England to buy the Rams. Needless 
to say, the American Minister not only had no 
part in the matter, but his assistance was neither 
sought nor offered. 

In " Queen Victoria and the Civil War " the 
author quotes the personal reminiscence of one 
of New York's first citizens as given at a great 
public banquet in that city in 1901. He, the 
speaker, had in 1862 been charged by the Ameri- 
can Minister in Paris with a secret message for 
Mr. Adams in London. He was to inform the 
American Minister there that Napoleon III. had 
proposed to Great Britain to recognize the Con- 
federacy at once. Upon receipt of this message 
Mr. Adams, according to the story, went di- 
rectly to Windsor, was granted an audience with 
the Queen, and received her assurance that 
" Great Britain would not recognize the Con- 
federacy." Negative evidence again comes to 
the rescue, not only in regard to this particular 
utterance of the Queen (for the author clearly 
proves that no such audience was ever held), 
but for all that critical period when British in- 
tervention was looked to or would have been 



serviceable to the South. It has been pleas- 
ant to Americans to believe that the gracious 
Queen interested herself in the preservation of 
the Union, but the present study shatters this 
" Victorian legend." " There is nothing what- 
ever to indicate that the Queen ever felt any per- 
sonal interest in the American struggle, or, after 
the Prince Consort's death (December 1861), 
sought to influence in the slightest the policy of 
the ministry in regard to it." 

While Mr. Adams's conclusions in general 
are thoroughly convincing, his findings in regard 
to the final cause of British non-intervention in 
behalf of the Confederacy lack something in con- 
firmation. Granted Palmerston's jealousy of 
Gladstone, and the latter 's indiscretion in assum- 
ing to foreshadow Cabinet policy, it is still diffi- 
cult to believe that the cause of the South was 
so evenly balanced that the accident of personal 
distrust should determine its fate. Doubtless 
it was a genuine satisfaction to the Prime Min- 
ister to nullify Gladstone's vaunted predictions 
as partial punishment for his temerity, but the 
facts are as yet not sufficiently well known to 
permit a final judgment. In most respects, how- 
ever, one must agree with the author's findings, 
and must congratulate him upon the skill with 
which he makes minute historical investigation 
readable and attractive. Meanwhile, students 
of history await with expectation that larger re- 
sult of Mr. Adams's studies for which the Diary 
of his father should furnish the basis, or it may 
be an edition of the Diary itself.

THE DIAL 



[April 1, 



and heart as they persist in the consciousness of 
maturer years. 

" No need had we the world to roam 
To find new shores, for round our home 
Our undiscovered lands arose 
In autumn mists, in winter snows. 
On summer night* in whispering trees 
We heard the wash of Indian seas; 
And ripening waves of harvest rolled 
Over our hills the realms of gold ; 
And flood-time mapped familiar lands 
With island shores and foreign strands; 
And tidings of unventnred ways 
We gathered in the darkening days 
When leafless woods began to moan 
And twilight opened gates unknown. 
A narrower, homelier world we knew 
In winter time, and kinder grew 
The sheltering bounds of landmarks old ; 
And, gathered within farm and fold, 
The sound of voices and the stir 
Of labour seemed the merrier 
Because so lonely and so wide 
And homeless was the world outside." 

One cannot read the " First Horizons " from which 
these lines are taken without recalling " Snow- 
bound," which, on a larger scale, makes its appeal 
by the same qualities of simplicity and truth. This 
is the very spirit of childhood, and happy are they 
who have not wholly lost it with the years : 

" We were a part of all that we beheld 
In those young days: it was our joy that welled 
Into the sunshine with the mountain rill. 
Our heart that in the rose's heart lay still, 
Our wings that held the sea-bird o'er the foam, 
Our feet that brought the wandering outcast home. 
Earth had no secret that we could not share 
For everything we saw and loved we were." 

Even in those poems which portray the soul freed 
from the illusions of youth, and face to face with the 
enigma of existence, the note of wistful reminiscence 
is heard. In " The Test of Faith," Mr. Lysaght lets 
us see how his thought has worked out the moral 
problem of the world, finding the solution which 
William James puts forth with persuasive eloquence 
in his philosophical essays. 

" We have beheld the evil and the good, 
And know, ourselves, the strength of wrong withstood. 
May it not be that Qod is everywhere 

Striving Himself against eternal wrong ? 
May it not be that on that battle-field 
He needs the help of those His love would shield ? 
May not His arm be bound by our despair ? 

May not our courage help to make it strong '.' 

" Come ! ere strength fail us, be it ours to guard 
That good which now can be upheld or marred, 
Tending, it may be, in our earth-born dust, 

The mortal seed of some immortal bloom. 
Come ! can we dare to pause or hesitate 
When we may be the conquerors of fate, 
When fighting on God's side for life's great trust 

Our victory may break the bonds of doom ? 

" And if no hope appears, yet having seen 

Dreams of what should be and what might have been, 
If as a crippled battle-ship that Kinks, 

Flying her fighting colours to the fleet, 
We face the end, is there no fountain-head 
Of strength divine from which such strength is fed ? 
Must not our lives be bound with unseen links 

To some great heart that cannot know defeat ? ' 



These revelations of the inner life, whether concerned 
with picturings from the pages of memory or with 
the vision of the world as revealed to the ripe intel- 
ligence, constitute a volume of very beautiful v -r-. . 
verse of the sort over which one lingers and to which 
one is tempted to return. Mr. Lysaght's thoughts are 
not only worth while, but they are also embodied in 
measures that delight the ear. 

Mr. Donald J. Overy opens his volume called 
"Eidola" with an "apologia." 

" I care not though ten thousand have sung 
Dirinely well. 
I too will sing. 

What though ten thousand have loved 
Shall my love have no Spring ? " 

And so he sings, in a thin and not altogether tuneful 
voice, such strains as the following: 

"She sat on the primrose-bank alone, 

A green-clad maid, and there, 
In her lap, the wayside flowers were thrown, 
While daffodils decked her hair. 

" Was it a lark, or a lake of blue 

With a silver strand, in the sky, 
That she held her head so high to view, 
To drop it, soon, with a sigh? 

" Nay ! 't was the whisper, the echo, the call . . . 

That none but a woman may hear, 
In the spring of the year and on to the fall. 
That makes life's meaning clear." 

Mr. Overy's verse is rather commonplace; neither 
in sentiment nor in diction does it have the arrest- 
ing quality without which all attempted poetry is 
futile. 

The title-page of Mr. William Force Stead's 
" Windflowers " thus appeals to the "skimming 

critic " : 

" Read ye either not at all, 
Or discerningly and well." 

We have read Mr. Stead's lyrics with sufficient 
discernment to discover in them a most exquisite 
music and a marked clarity of thought. This epi- 
taph for a young girl, for example, closely approaches 
perfection : 

A week since, and I saw her smile 
In sunlight by the meadow-stile: 
A day since, and the lilies gave 
Faint light and fragrance from her grave : 
And now, with dawn above them spread, 
She and the lilies both are dead." 

It seems to belong in the Greek Anthology, and we 
could easily imagine it to have been penned by 
Landor. And here is a lyric whose wayward move- 
ment reminds one of Meredith : 
" O that I could sing of her, sing of her as she is, 
Sing the light her spirit scatters, all the aural bliss 

Round her ever wreathing, 

In measures of hr breathing 

"O that I oonld sing of her, sing of the sunrise darting 
Brightly from those cloudy rifU that are her eyelids parting ; 
Mng all her wild March-gladness, 
And quiet May-noon sadness. 

"O that I could sing of her, sing of my lovely one ! 
I should be as God whose singing shaped the moon and sun, 
And set the quick herb growing, 
And rhythmic rivers flowing." 



1912.] 



THE DIAL

The most ambitious of these lyrics is " The Song of 
Bolderwood," in the form of an ode, from which 
we quote this section : 

" The Holy Spirit spake to me, 
Saying : When thou hast ceased to be, 

Thou shalt at last attain 
Unto the calm of middle night, 
And clarity of morning light, 

And helpfulness of rain. 
In May, the month of hluest flowers, 

Thy spirit shall be given wholly 
To shining through the golden hours 

By hill and meadow lowly. 
This light that was so dim in tliee, 
That flickered in adversity 

On sin-dominioned ways, 
This light that sank amid the gloom 
Of hollows ridged with peaks of doom, 
This light, a taper in a tomb, 

Shall rising trick its rays; 
Of it shall be the twilig-ht hue 
Of pansies, and the morning blue 

Of wild wood-violets ; 
Forget-me-not and robin's eye, 
And hare-bells, like a placid sky 

After the red sun sets, 
Shall own the spirit's risen light 

Arid clearly shall it shine 
In corn-flowers on the windy height 

And hill-side flower of vine. 
In time of rime and sifting snow, 
Thy light within the wood shall grow 
Red holly and white mistletoe : 
In spring, that radiant orb terrene, 
The daffodil, that 's ever seen 
Where grass is longest and most green ; 
Thy spirit's risen light shall be 
Along the washes by the sea 
Marsh-mallow and marsh-rosmary." 

The thought of death becomes gracious in these verses, 
which stand in sharp contrast to the melancholy mus- 
ing of most young poets. They seem to be a ser- 
mon upon a text from "Adonais" "He is made 
one with nature," or a new expression of the 
Meredithian joy of earth. 

Mr. Gerald Gould is a graceful singer whose work 
we had the pleasure of noticing two or three years 
ago. He has both imagination and passion, and the 
power of imparting vivid emotion. "Light Love" 
is not, perhaps, as deep as some of his lyrics, but it 
is one of the most charming. 

" Give me not passion not the touch 
Of lips and limbs that yield too much 
Not the close shuddering shaken kiss 
That says ' A heart must break for this,' 
But laughing kisses, soft and light 
As these grey moths that cloud the night, 
And the half- whimsical caress 
That hints, not masters, happiness. 

" Sing me not songs that have their source 
In raptures perilous perforce 
Not notes that climb the tragic stairs, 
But delicate and dancing airs, 
As inconsiderate as those gleams 
From eyes like star-bewildered streams, 
Those locks incontinently tossed 
Round brows too lovely to be lost. 

" So, when the summer night is spent, 
Take back what you not gave but lent, 
And lay at some more stable shrine 
The gift I never claimed for mine. 



Ah ! come not when the winter weeps, 
With pallid mouth to haunt my sleeps, 
Or hands that tremble at my door 
To 'mind me of what went before." 

The two stanzas entitled "Life and Death" deserve 
to be quoted. 

" I have lived for I have seen afar 
Upon the silence and the height 
Cities enkindled where the star 

Of morning slew the stars of night. 

" I have died for I have watched the day 

Be withered as myself must be 
Slowly, beyond the gathering grey 
And plangent plunging of the sea." 

Miss Marion Fox's verses entitled "The Lost 
Vocation" are inspired by a mystical idea which is 
thus stated: "The idea of a distinct personality re- 
turning from beyond the unknown to re-inhabit a 
living human body has been and is often still accepted. 
The soul of a nun returning to a world where for 
the most part such a vocation is now impossible 
partakes both of comedy and tragedy comedy to 
the beholder, tragedy to the actor. That this might 
be the explanation of that mysterious grayness, 
dulness, which we see in so many of our fellows is 
a theory I should like to submit, though well aware 
how hard it were to prove my case." "Waiting" is 
one of the poems suggested by this idea. 

" When you and I have come to meet 

Out of the silent southern land, 
With longing eyes and hearts that greet 

Each other, we shall understand 
How all the walking of wild ways 
Was but a path to happier days. 

'' From the hot airs and odours sweet, 

Enfeebling mind, and will, and hand ; 
From glaring sun, and dust, and heat ; 

From sights bewildering and grand; 
In some dim place where wood-wind plays 
'Mongst dew-wet grass shall meet our ways. 

" The soft, cool trees, all green and old, 

Wait for the coming of us twain ; 
The simple birds their hearts unfold 
In song, for when we meet again. 
Only Time waits with laggard feet, 
And turns his hour-glass passing fleet." 

Just how this poem illustrates the thought of the writ- 
er's thesis we do not find it easy to understand, and, 
in fact, we might read the whole collection without 
suspecting that it was designed for the purpose stated 
in the introductory note. 

In "The Human Fantasy," Mr. John Hall 
Wheelock has aimed to express "the life of to-day 
in all its beauty and terrible complexity of joy and 
sorrow." The greater part of his volume is made 
up of a narrative poem a string of episodes 
describing the experiences of a young man hungry 
for love, who finds in a shop-girl an object for his 
devotions. He does not carry his passion to the 
point of seduction, which differentiates the story 
from most others of its class. We quote the section 
called "Twilight along the Park." 

" Down the stone valley, carven steps and straight, 
Into the clouds, the streets of twilight run 
That blend in molten bars about the sun, 
Into the sunset and the evening's gate,

THE DIAL, 



[April 1. 



" Reopening on starred heaven. The first few 
Flames of her holy chamber now are seen, 
Beyond the flickering twilight's fields of green 
And the pierced clouds deep in the boundless bine. 

" The stately mansions loom along the dark, 
The sombre and dim desert all around ; 
In the whole world there is one only sound, 
A cracked old organ wheezing from the Park. 

" 'Mid the starred peace colossal and supreme, 
Presumptuous, the only human voice, 
Full of old tunes and ditties that rejoice 
Half dolefully and die. The houses dream." 

There are other pictures of this sort, etched quite 
as strikingly, in the course of the narrative. In its 
human aspect, the story has a wistful pathos that 
recalls Ernest Dowson, while its staccato passages 
remind us, both in substance and form, of Henley's 
London Voluntaries." Mr. Wheelock adopts swing- 
ing and unfettered rhythms, and his diction, despite 
its freedom, falls upon the ear with undeniably poet- 
ical effect. We are informed that he was the Har- 
vard Class Poet of 1908, and his work exhibits 
precisely the type of vital realism and modernity 
that has characterized the group of poets Moody, 
Lodge, Stickney, Robinson, and MacKaye that 
Harvard has given to our literature during the last 
score of years. 

The fact that Mr. John Carter, the author of 
"Hard Labor and Other Poems," has served a term 
in the Minnesota State Prison, is made use of by his 
publishers for advertising purposes, but should not 
occupy the attention of the critic, except in so far 
as the unfortunate experience is reflected in the 
verses themselves. Mr. Carter makes no bones of 
the fact, however, any more than did the author of 
"De Profundis" and (< The Ballad of Reading Gaol," 
and hence we are not called upon to conceal it. He 
voices the cry of his fellows in a " Ballade of Misery 
and Iron." 

" Haggard faces and trembling knees, 

Eyes that shine with a weakling's hate, 

Lips that mutter their blasphemies, 
Murderous hearts that darkly wait : 
These are they who were men of late, 

Fit to hold a plough or a sword. 
If a prayer this wall may penetrate, 

Have pity on these my comrades, Lord ! " 

And here is the envoy of the ballade: 

" These are pawns that the hand of Fate 

Careless sweeps from the checker-board. 
Thou that know st if the game be straight, 
Have pity on these my comrades, Lord ! " 

A rankling notion that the game is not "straight" 
is doubtless at the heart of the sullen resentment 
with which the convict endures his punishment, but 
as a rule the crookedness of the game is evidenced, 
not by his own fate, but by the fact that it is not 
shared by all who equally deserve it It is a fate 
tenfold more bitter to the sensitive spirit than to 
the stolid, but such differences between individuals 
the law, with its measure of retribution, cannot recog- 
nize. The appeal of these prison poems is rather 
to sentiment than to the sense of justice; if the con- 



sciousness of duress were mingled with something 
more of the consciousness of soul-cleansing expia- 
tion, the appeal would be much stronger than it i-. 
Mr. Carter clearly has the lyric jjift. and hi-, poig- 
nant outpourings offer a real contribution to the 
science of penology. 

We may describe as average magazine verse the 
pieces that make up Mr. N. D. Anderson's "The 
Voice of the Infinite, and Other Poems." The 
themes are various, and there is imagination in 
their treatment, but the diction is often painfully 
prosaic. As an example of the best to be found 
in this volume, we quote from the conclusion of 
" The Thin Blue Line." 

" The thin blue line that falters not 
God's vengeance on thy Captains be ! 
Have they their fathers' wrongs forgot, 
To hurt their brothers' liberty ? 
All men are equal born, those held ; 
Shall these, the lesser, then in vain 
Hold all their fathers made so plain, 
And seek the slaver's chains to weld '.' 
God's vengeance on thy Captains be, 
If they hold not their murderous hands ! 
The wilder race loves liberty, 
Leave then to them their native lands." 

This poem makes anything but a close approach to 
Moody's great Ode upon the shameful chapter of 
our dealing with the Philippines, but we welcome the 
writer as a sincere and worthy recruit in the moral 
campaign that is bound sometime to bring the nation 
to the consciousness of its wrong-doing. 

Mr. Charles Hanson Towne's "Youth" is a long 
domestic idyl of a young architect and his wife, their 
friends the poet and the girl from the prairies, and 
the lady for whom the architect is building a house. 
It is a sentimental novelette in such verse as this : 

" There were low lines of shelves to hold their books 
Volumes they both had long since learned to love 
Omar and Epictetus, Shelley, Keats, 
Marcus Anrelius, and R. L. S., 
Rossetti, Browning, Ruskin, and some good 
Old architectural sets that Donald knew 
Almost by heart." 

Or as this : 

New York, 

With its great theatres and its opera, 
Its art museums and superb hotels, 
Its Subway and its Elevated Road, 
Its taxicabs and famed Fifth Avenue." 

We regret to record that Donald l>ecame ensnared 
(happily for a time only) by the charms of the lady 
patron of his art, and that Lucy did not find her 
stoic philosophers adequate to console her. Of 
Mr. Towne's "Other Poems," we particularly like 
" Love's Ritual." 

Breathe me the ancient words when I shall find 

Your spirit mine ; if, seeking you, life wins 
New wonder, with old splendor let us bind 

Our hearts when Love's high sacrament begins. 

" Exalt my soul with pomp and pageantry, 
Sing the eternal songs all lovers sing ; 
Yea, when you come, gold let onr vestments be, 
And lamps of silver let us softly swing.

" But if at last (hark how I whisper, Love ! ), 

Yon from my temple and from me should turn, 
I pray you chant no psalm my grief above, 
Over the body of Pain let no light burn. 

" Go forth in silence, quiet as a dove, 

Drift, with no sign, from our exultant place ; 
We need no Ite at the death of Love, 

And none should come to look on Love's white face." 

The late Mr. Henley turned to impressive poetical 
account his sojourn as a patient in a London hospital. 
In Miss Grace Fallow Norton's " Little Gray Songs 
from St. Joseph's " we are given what purport to be 
the verses written from time to time by a working girl 
who spent two years on a bed of pain in a Franciscan 
hospital, and finally died. These "little letters to 
herself," we are told to imagine, were hidden beneath 
her pillow, and preserved with loving care after her 
death by one of the good sisters. In these stanzas 
she tells us of the chance by which she came into the 
world : 

" Because white hands clasped white hands, 

And white arms wound white arms, 

I'm wandering through the wide world, 

Driven by those same heart-storms. 

'' Because white arms wound white arms 

Must mine hang quivering, bare, 
All vain to reach and clasp again 
White arms again as fair. 

" Did they that clasped desire me ? 

Oh no, 't was heart on heart, 
'T was lip to lip and life for life 
Now living is my part. 

" Did they that loved stand awed at 

My masked inheritance ? 
They laughed and called the echo . . . 
I am a child of chance." 

What a commentary upon the recklessness of passion 
may be read between the lines of this pathetic plaint! 
And with what soft appealing beauty is the thought 
of death illuminated by the following song: 
" great Allayer of our pain, 

That some day shuts all eyelids down, 
Wilt thou come softly, like the rain, 

When he goes through to cleanse the town ? 

" Wilt thou come singing with the wind, 

Who shouts and sweeps the dust away, 
And scatters thus triumphantly 
The little hoarded heaps of clay ? 

" Or smiling silent, like the sun 

Who ripens ere they fall to rest 
Earth's flowers and fruits, so one by one, 
They mellow drop upon her breast ? 

'' great Allayer of our pain, 
sure Encompasser of all 
Our woe : O come gently, as rain 

Doth come ; let not thy terrors call." 

There is even a note of joyous anticipation of the re- 
lief that the end shall bring in such verses as these: 
" But if my star of joy should call 

A call as stars may give 
' Awake, O slumbering little soul, 
Awake, arise, and live!' 

' How would a soul reach out to life 

From silence and the tomb ; 
How would a soul unfold to light 
And up through darkness bloom ! 



" How would a laughing soul scale Heaven 

And star on star let fall, 
If o'er the death-song of the worlds 
My star of joy should call ! '' 

It is their very artlessness that gives to these lyrics 
the poignant pathos which is their burden, and he 
would have a dull soul who could read them un- 
moved. WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



Japanese 
painting 
and its laws. 



Of unusual interest to students of Far 
Eastern art is Mr. Henry P. Bowie's 
book, "On the Laws of Japanese 
Painting" (Paul Elder & Co.). The desirability of 
a treatise setting forth the psychological considera- 
tions by which the Japanese painters are guided in 
the constructive work of picture making, and giving 
some idea of their practical application, has long 
been realized. As an aid to understanding and 
appreciation the value of such a book could hardly 
be overestimated, but the lack of the necessary equip- 
ment of technical knowledge has hitherto deterred 
anyone from attempting it. Mr. Bowie lived for 
more than nine years in Japan, studying the lan- 
guage, learning to write Chinese characters under 
the tutelage of eminent calligraphers, and receiving 
daily instruction in painting from some of the best 
of the modern artists residing in Kyoto. In this 
way he gained an insight into the animating spirit 
of Japanese art, and a working familiarity with its 
many canons, such as few other foreigners, if any, 
have ever acquired. Of these canons he tells us 
there are no less than seventy-two that are recog- 
nized us important. Not all of them, however, can 
strictly speaking be designated as laws. The word 
connotes imperative conformity ; and in attaching it 
to mere rules, precepts, and methods, there is some 
danger of producing a false impression. For exam- 
ple, it is obvious that the eight different ways of 
painting rocks and the eighteen forms of outline 
used in drawing draped figures are not what we or- 
dinarily call laws. Allowance being made for this 
peculiar terminology, there can be no doubt that 
Mr. Bowie has written an instructive book. After 
a few pages of personal experiences, and a chapter 
of miscellaneous information about "Art in Japan," 
he takes up "The Laws for the Use of Brush and 
Materials," "The Laws Governing the Conception 
and Execution of a Painting," "The Canons of the 
^Esthetics of Japanese Painting," and follows them 
with a chapter upon "Subjects for Japanese Paint- 
ing" and a brief one upon "Signatures and Seals." 
This enumeration will show the scope of the book. 
Before the opening chapter Mr. Bowie prints the 
cardinal exordium, "Ken wan choku hitsu" ("A 
firm arm and a perpendicular brush "), which is the 
keynote in the technic of Japanese painting. Not 
so much is said about some of the laws as could be 
wished, and from the book alone one could hardly 
discover how to apply them. But one thing Mr. 



286 



[April 1. 



Bowie has made very plain. The intent of all the 
laws is to help the artists to produce paintings in 
which every touch of the brush shall be instinct 
with life, the only kind of paintings, be it said, 
that the Japanese recognize as works of art The 
book is amply illustrated by reproductions of pic- 
tures by noted artists, and by an excellent series of 
explanatory plates specially prepared by Mr. Shimada 
Sekko to elucidate the text 



The ">*&** "Barren Grounds " 
the \orthem that stretch to and beyond the Arctic 
,,-iMrrneu. Circle to the northwest of Hudson's 
Bay are, according to Mr. Ernest Thompson Seton, 
in reality rich pastures, clothed in verdure and be- 
decked in the short arctic summer with brilliant 
flowers. The animal life is abundant also, for here 
ranges the great northern herd of caribou which the 
author estimates at over thirty million head. In his 
latest book, entitled "Arctic Prairies" (Scribner), 
Mr. Seton gives in his inimitable style a breezy but 
withal very succinct account of his canoe-journey of 
two thousand miles in search of the caribou, of his suc- 
cessful efforts to find the small remnant of the north- 
ern bison herd, and of his explorations in the region 
north of Aylmer Lake. It is a pleasing narrative 
of travel, with the quarrelsome bickering children of 
the northern woods for helpers and guides and the 
good offices of the Hudson Bay Company to forward 
his enterprise. Sport and adventure are not lacking, 
as witness the exciting race down fourteen miles in 
the canyon of the Athabasca, when "the river showed 
its teeth" and wrecked the outfit, sending the pre- 
cious records, notebooks, and drawings dashing down 
over icy rocks and amid storm-piled timbers. But 
the book is not merely a record of travel : it is full of 
notes and incidents relating to the natural history of 
these northern wilds. Not only were the big game, 
the bison, caribou, and musk-ox, the objects of 
the author's search, but the humbler folk in fur and 
feathers and the trees and flowers as well. The 
pages of the book abound in sketches of bits of 
scenery, flowers, foot-prints, and bits of aboriginal 
life, all portrayed with scientific clearness and often 
with artistic results. Appendices setting forth the 
agricultural possibilities of this great region, lists of 
the mammals, birds, insects, and plants, and a plan 
for the introduction of the Thibetan Yak, conclude 
this best of all accounts of the natural history of the 
prairies of the remote north. 

Mr. Rudolph Chambers Lehman n 
ItoS&u. haa P eculiar qualifications for the 

editorship of "Charles Dickens as 
Editor" (Sturgis & Walton Co.), the most freshly 
interesting of the Dickens books celebrating the 
centenary of the great novelist's birth. Mr. Leh- 
mann is a grand-nephew of William Henry Wills, 
to whom the two hundred or more letters in the 
book were written by his editorial chief of " House- 
hold Words " and " All the Year Round." It should 
be added, for accuracy's sake, that five letters from 



Wills to Dickens are also included. By a curious 
chance it happens that Mr. Lrlmiann, in addition 
to other ties binding him to Dickens's sub-editor, 
was himself for one year (1901) editor of "The 
Daily News," the journal started by Dickens in 1 * 1 
with Wills on the editorial staff, but handed over 
to John Forster in less than three weeks; and it 
also happens that Mr. Lflnnann lists Wen >iiu-r 
1890 on the staff of "Punch, ' which Wills helped 
to found in 1841. He is, moreover, favorably re- 
membered in this country as the athletic young 
Englishman who about ten years ago came over to 
coach the Harvard crew and, as it proved, to win 
an American girl as his wife. And now for the 
book itself. After a few pages of introduction, 
which contain some account of Wills and his pecul- 
iarities, the substance of the volume is presented in 
chronological order under the headings, "Bentley's 
Miscellany," which Dickens edited for two years 
beginning in January, 1837; "The Daily News," 
his brief connection with which has already been 
mentioned; "Household Words," which engaged 
his editorial attention from 1850 to 1858; and 
"All the Year Round," which he conducted from 
1859 until his death in 1870. Mr. Lehmann has 
supplied such explanatory matter as is required to 
knit these letters into a connected and intelligible 
whole, and he has enriched his volume with por- 
traits of Dickens, Wills, Wilkie Collins, and Thack- 
eray. A good analytical index closes the book. 
Being new to the public, these letters furnish a 
fresh as well as an attractive picture of Dickens the 
indefatigable and resourceful literary worker, ardent 
and at the same time patient, impulsive but stead- 
fast, expecting from his subordinates something of 
his own conscientious industry, and generous in his 
recognition of loyal service. It is a book that will 
help to a better acquaintance with the brilliant and 
versatile and amazingly energetic Dickens.

made its welcome appearance. "The Comments of

old bachelor's papers that had come to light soon 
after the publication of the initial volume. Many <>f 
the "comments "are in the form of letters, or extracts 
from letters, some especially diverting ones b-in^ 
addressed to the writer's niece, Molly Harman, who 
forwards the whole budget of papers to the supposed 
" editor." The same agreeable quality of randomness 
(if the term is allowable) characterizes this second 
instalment of Bagshotisms as made the first so enjoy- 
able. Here are one or two good things thrown off 
by our lamented friend: "I consider it a great im- 
pertinence for a stranger to quarrel with me, but it 
is often quite a compliment for a friend to be angry 
with me. It shows that he really cares what I think

and say." "Early in life I had great ambitions. 
Since I reached fifty I have begun to hope that I 
shall get through without scandal." " Of all the open- 
fighting careers politics is the most ruthless and the 
most exacting. It is a fight in which your friend 
more than your enemy is a competitor for the prize 
you seek. Hence for the ambitious man the society 
of an opponent is more restful than the society of a 
friend." But the following is not what was to have 
been expected from so cheerful and wise a philoso- 
pher : " The worst thing about life is that the worst 
part comes last. In another life the reward of the 
just man must, surely, be to work backward from old 
age to youth." And the writer of this, be it noted, 
expressly declares that, as life goes on, he has " less 
and less time for mere railing against the fixed frame- 
work of the universe." The accomplished editor of 
"The Westminster Gazette " has chosen both a handy 
and an attractive form in which to cast his odds and 
ends of observation and reflection. 



American "Social Evolution and Political 

lectures of mi ^i_ i i i 

an English Iheory was the subject chosen by 

sociologist. Mr. Leonard T. Hobhouse, perhaps 

the foremost English sociologist of to-day, for his 
Beer Foundation lectures at Columbia University 
last year, now issued in book form by the Columbia 
University Press. To an American reader the fea- 
ture of outstanding interest in these lectures is not 
anything so very novel in the way of sociological 
theory, but the novel way, to us, in which the lec- 
turer is enabled to go to contemporary political life 
for his illustrations, and more than that, for his sup- 
port in advocating a view of social philosophy as an 
adequate instrument for harmonizing human life, 
doing away with its irrational and blindly struggling 
elements, and moulding it into a self-directing, coop- 
erative commonwealth where the best impulses of 
human nature will be at home. Evidently England 
is a richer laboratory for the sociologist than Amer- 
ica. The thesis of Professor Hobhouse is that social 
progress is a possibility. As against the individual- 
ists, the believers in uncontrolled competition and 
uncontrolled elimination, he believes that society as 
a whole can be organized, and can press on toward 
a fuller life without leaving a line of broken strag- 
glers along the way. The chief argument against 
this assumption is made by the Eugenists, who claim 
that social progress defeats itself by preserving in- 
ferior types and so leading to race deterioration. 
After Professor Hobhouse has examined the alterna- 
tive programme of the Eugenists, pointed out the 
purely relative character of what they call desirable 
traits, and flatly denied that there is such a thing as 
wholesale race deterioration in England, there seems 
very little left of the Eugenic platform except the 
admitted importance of not permitting the breeding 
of unquestionably defective people. Thus the tone of 
Professor Hobhouse's book is decidedly optimistic; 
and it should have no little inspirational value in 
America, where social emphasis is so badly needed. 



A friend and 



M. Xavier Paoli, for twenty-five 
years preceding his resignation in 
of kino,. 1909 a member of the French police 

force whose special duty it was to watch over the 
persons of visiting monarchs, has probably enjoyed 
the personal acquaintance of more kings and queens 
than has any other man living. Shortly after his res- 
ignation he published a volume of memories, which 
now appear in an English translation entitled " Their 
Majesties asl Knew Them " (Sturgis & Walton Co.). 
The English version is by that breezy translator, A. 
Teixera de Mattos, whose work, though not always 
English or always accurate or always sensible or 
always strictly logical, is always eminently readable. 
The list of crowned heads discussed is a varied one, 
from the monkey-like and enthusiastic monarch of 
Cambodia to the sad and quiet Empress Elizabeth of 
Austria, and includes, besides the objects of merely 
incidental reference, the King of Spain, the Shah of 
Persia, the Czar, the King and Queen of Italy, King 
George of Greece, Queen Wilhelmina, the deceased 
King of the Belgians, and the last three rulers of 
England. The most unassuming of autobiographers, 
M. Paoli suffers no illusions as to the skill and suc- 
cess with which he discharged his duties as " the 
Guardian of Kings" (to quote His Majesty George 
of Greece), and he is himself by no means the least 
interesting personality called up before us. The 
most striking single evidence of his tact which the 
volume records is perhaps contained in the story of 
the pot of Marseilles "bouillabaisse" which the 
Queen of Holland and her suite could not appreciate 
and which M. Paoli consequently refused to touch, 
although he was as passionately fond of it as any 
Provencal could have been. These pages from M. 
Paoli's official life should meet as cordial a reception 
in this country as they have already met in France. 

Medical " Old English Libraries" (McClurg), 

precursors of the by Mr. Ernest A. Savage, concerns 
public library. it se if b u t little with the equipment 
and management of such libraries, ground which 
has already been well covered by others, but treats 
more particularly of "the making, use, and circu- 
lation of books considered as a means of literary 
culture," and makes generous use of illustrations and 
facsimiles to render its meaning clearer. A prelim- 
inary chapter deals briefly with the use of books in 
early Irish monasteries, after which come chapters 
on the English monks and their books, libraries of 
the great abbeys and the dispersal of monkish libra- 
ries, book-making and book-collecting in the religious 
houses, cathedral and church libraries, academic libra- 
ries (Oxford and Cambridge) and their management, 
the use of books toward the end of the manuscript 
period, the book trade, and, finally, the general char- 
acter of the mediaeval library and the extent to which 
its books were circulated. Appended matter gives 
information on prices of books and materials for 
book-making, names of classic authors found in me- 
diaeval catalogues, a list of mediaeval book-collections,

and a bibliography of the subjects discussed in Mr. 
Savage's work. Mr. James Hutt is chiefly respon- 
sible for the chapter on the libraries of Oxford, but 
his expected collaboration in the rest of the book was 
prevented by illness. Industry and scholarship and 
enthusiasm have evidently been brought to the pre- 
paration of the volume, which, despite the unavoid- 
ably dry-as-dust character of many of the topics dealt 
with, does nevertheless contrive to include incidents 
illustrative of human nature, which shows itself to 
have been much the same in mediaeval as in modern 
England. The fewness and the cost of books, and 
the very restricted privileges of library-users, as 
described by Mr. Savage, may well cause the mod- 
ern reader to feel a renewed thankfulness for his own 
happier lot in this age of the printing-press and the 
public library. _ 



The "jovial Stuart literature is still grow- 

monarch" and ing: one of its most recent additions 
hit court. jg a volume by Mr. A. C. A. Brett on 

" Charles II. and his Court" (Putnam). The author 
feels that an over-critical world has not done justice 
to the jovial monarch, too much attention having 
been given to dubious political policies and to the 
king's personal shortcomings in careless word or 
deliberate action. But Mr. Brett goes to the other 
extreme: personal matters, trivial and important, 
are related with much detail; but we do not find 
very much of Charles's activities as a king. Of his 
absolutist schemes and his treasonable negotiations 
with Louis XIV., we are told almost nothing ; of the 
despotism that played havoc with the English con- 
stitution during the closing years of the reign, prac- 
tically nothing. Charles II. "was a very pleasant 
fellow," and it is the picture of such a fellow that is 
sketched in the present work. It must not be as- 
sumed that the author is oblivious to King Charles's 
faults ; these are all produced and properly labeled, 
but in addition we are shown so much that is attract- 
ive in the royal character that the dark lines fade to 
some extent The book also contains valuable chap- 
ters on London in the Restoration period, and the 
court life of the time. Large use is made of quota- 
tions from the literature of the age, the poems of 
Dryden and Butler, the diaries of Evelyn and Pepys, 
and of other works. The style is humorous, easy, and 
sprightly, in every way in keeping with the theme. 
Students will find the work valuable as supplement- 
ing older authorities; but Osmund Airy's little book 
still seems to be the most satisfactory biography of 
Charles II. 

Dr. William S. Sadler's "The Physi- 
ology of Faith and Fear" (McClurg) 
is an example of a popularization 
of a subject at present much in vogue and legiti- 
mately appealing to general interests. It concerns 
the mind in health and disease. Such contribu- 
tions to mental hygiene are now abundant ; and 
while indicating a wide interest, the demand sug- 
gests the application of more critical standards to 
the additions to the supply. Dr. Sadler's volume 



The mind 
in health 
anil (lit fair. 



attempts to be popular at any cost, and loses both 
in effectiveness and system, in the ijuulity of its 
appeal as well as in taste and good judgment of pre- 
sentation. There are good points both in the t he-l- 
and in the way in which it is sustained. The con- 
trast of faith as representing the optimistic view of 
the outcome, with fear as the worrying and depreM- 
ing attitude of mind, is insisted upon in season and 
out of season, and is made to account for a larger 
share of the mental economy than it can legitimately 
support. While commending Dr. Sadler's purpose 
and, with greater reservations, his mode of carrying 
it out, it still remains true that faith and fear ;u 
not as ultimate or as comprehensive contrasts as 
appears on the surface. They are attitudes con-i-tent 
with temperament and to be interpreted as such. 
In comparison with many another book on mental 
hygiene, this volume must be given an inferior 
rating. Moreover, it is affected throughout by a 
striving for popularity which throws the entire ex- 
position out of balance, and seriously detracts from 
its usefulness, particularly from the service which it 
might otherwise have performed on the shelves of a 
public library. 

BRIEFER MENTION. 



A small volume called " Noted Speeches of George 
Washington, John Adams, and Patrick Henry" is edit-d 
for school use by Miss Lilian Marie Briggs. It eon- 
tains also the Declaration and the Federal Constitution. 
besides biographical sketches. Messrs. Moffat, Yard A. 
Co. are the publishers. 

To the "Original Narratives of Early American His- 
tory" (Scribner)a volume entitled " Narratives of Karlv 
Pennsylvania, West New Jersey, and Delaware," edited 
by Dr. Albert Cook Myers, lias been added. Tlic date* 
of the documents range from 1630 to 1707. Most of 
this matter, with the exception of Penn and 1'astorin-. 
is unfamiliar and not easily accessible, this being partic- 
ularly true of the documents relating to the S\\edi>h 
settlements. This volume will be a great help to the 
student in clearing up what is probably the most oh-cme 
section of our colonial history. 

In "The Bible Unveiled" (Independent Religion* 
Society) Mr. M. M. Mangasarian, the well-known ration- 
alist lecturer of Chicago, discn>-r* the content-, and the 
value of the Bible from a secularist standpoint. Mi 
Mangasarian's book is really a polemic against what has 
been termed bibliolatry, that is, the tendency to take 
the Bible as a whole, as if it were a literary unit, and 
then to worship it as a unit and as a receptacle of magic 
virtues. As examples of this attitude, extracts from 
Mr. Bryan's address on the occasion of the Tercentenary 
of the English Bible, and some recent remarks of Mr 
Roosevelt are quoted. Having laid this foundation, the 
author analyses many of the stories of the Old Testa- 
ment, and compares the moral side of Old Testament 
life to the moral aspects of the contemporary pagan life. 
He then considers the teachings of Jesus, and endeavors 
to show that what has been assumed to be the character- 
istic content of the Christian ethic < matter of 
fact, not even unique in its own day, but was born into a 
world in which pagan morality of the highest and pun >t 
type was already known to man.

Mr. Arnold Bennett's impressions of America begin 
in the April " Harper's " with a breezy sketch of the 
ocean voyage and first glimpses of New York. 

It is announced that publication of Mr. Winston 
Churchill's long-awaited novel, "The Inside of the 
Cup," has been postponed until spring of next year. 

" The Financier " will be the title of Mr. Theodore 
Dreiser's next novel, for which he is at present gather- 
ing material in Europe. He is also at work on a series 
of magazine articles embodying his impressions of Eu- 
ropean life and ways. 

" My Friendship with Prince Hohenlohe " is the title 
of a volume of memoirs by Baroness von Hedemann, 
which Messrs. Putnam will publish this month. The 
Baroness was for a long period Prince Hoheulohe's 
close friend and adviser. 

The success of the " Beautiful England " series issued 
by Messrs. Dana Estes & Co. has led the same publish- 
ers to plan a similar series devoted to " Beautiful Ire- 
land," for which Mr. Stephen Gwynn will supply the 
text and Mr. Alexander Williams the illustrations 

"Through the Postern Gate," a new novel by Mrs. 
Florence L. Barclay, author of " The Rosary," will be 
published during the present month by Messrs. Putnam. 
This has been appearing serially in the " Ladies' Home 
Journal " with the title, " Under the Mulberry Tree." 

The first instalment of Mr. John Fox's new novel, 
" The Heart of the Hills," appears in the April issue of 
" Scribner's Magazine." Another important serial which 
makes its initial appearance this month is Mr. Jeffery 
Farnol's " The Amateur Gentleman," in " McClure's." 

A French critic, M. Maurice Bourgeois, is writing a 
study of the life and art of John Synge, which may be 
expected later on in the year. The Irish literary move- 
ment received early appreciation from French men of 
letters, and a good deal of Synge's journalism took the 
form of articles and reviews of French books. 

An autobiographical account of " Two Visits to Den- 
mark," by Mr. Edmund Gosse, is an interesting item on 
Messrs. Dutton's announcement list. The visits were 
made when Mr. Gosse was a young man, and these im- 
pressions of the country and many of its greatest men 
have hitherto been held back for personal reasons. 

A series of handbooks entitled " Channels of English 
Literature," designed to trace the genesis and evolution 
of the various branches of English literature and 
thought, is announced by Messrs. Dutton. The first 
volume, to appear shortly, is Professor James Seth's 
" English Philosophers and Schools of Philosophy." 

Two hitherto unannounced volumes, of somewhat dis- 
similar character, to be published this spring by the 
Putnams, are " Paul the Minstrel, and Other Stories," a 
series of semi-medijeval romances by Mr. A. C. Benson; 
and " Pitching in a Pinch, and Other Stories of the Big 
League," by Mr. Christy Mathewson of the New York 
" Giants." 

Since completing his life of Karl Marx, almost all of 
Mr. John Spargo's time not devoted to public lecturing 
has been given to the preparation of his " Applied Social- 
ism: A Study of the Application of Socialistic Principles 
to the State," which Mr. B. W. Huebsch will publish 
this month. It is, in effect, the platform of the pro- 
gressive Socialist, and presents succinctly his attitude 
on the important aspects of life under a Socialist State. 



The publication of a new and definitive edition of the 
works of Mr. Thomas Hardy, to be styled " The Wessex 
Edition," will be undertaken immediately by Messrs. 
Macmillan & Co. of London. The series will be com- 
pleted in twenty volumes, and two volumes will be 
issued monthly. Each book will contain a frontispiece 
in photogravure and a map of the Wessex of the novels 
and poems. " Tess of the d'Urbervilles " and " Far 
from the Maddening Crowd " will appear first, and the 
former will contain a general preface which the author 
has written for the new edition. 

St. Paul, Minn., seems now to be assured of the new 
library building it has so long needed. A recent news- 
paper despatch says that Mr. James J. Hill has an- 
nounced that he will build and maintain in that city a 
reference library to cost not less than three hundred 
and fifty thousand dollars, and that this generosity on 
his part makes it possible for the city to erect a library 
building that shall cost half a million dollars, and 
further that " the library will represent an expenditure 
of $976,000." The details do not yet stand out with 
clearness, but it is evident that the library needs of St. 
Paul are about to receive something like adequate 
attention.

Suggestion and Psychotherapy 

By GEORGE W. JACOBY, M.D. 

Dr. Jacoby, one of the most eminent of New York 
neurologists, has in this book popularized for the intel- 
ligent layman a subject about which everyone is talk- 
ing, but which is as intricate as it is important. He 
asserts "the influence of the mind in the causation and 
cure of disease," but his conclusions of detail with 
regard to this influence are based purely on scientific 
facts, analyzed and argued with the impartiality of a 
savant to whom pure speculation is irrelevant.

The Abolition Crusade and Its Consequences 

By HILARY A. HERBERT, LL.D.

bama, Secretary of the Navy under President Cleve- 
land, won distinction in the Confederate army. His

New Book on Sociology and Religion 

SOCIOLOGICAL STUDY OF THE BIBLE 

By LOUIS WALLIS 

Author of u An Examination of Society " 
Formerly Instructor in Economics and Sociology in the Ohio State University. 

r pHIS WORK will be both interesting and useful to all who are awake to present-day social and religions 
-*- problems. It is a new and remarkable treatise on the delelopment of the fundamental religious idea* of 
Christian civilization, written in a style which is clear to anyone who is genuinely interested in the subject. Strong 
words of commendation have been spoken by leading scholars who have examined the advance sheets of the book. 
While the modern school of historical criticism has been long committed to the view that the religion of the Bible 
is in some way the result of an evolutionary process, it has not thus far shown how this religion actually developed. 
Mr. Wallis puts the evolution itself before us in such a way that we can see the religious ideas of the Bible grad- 
ually taking shape in response to the pressure of social developments. Professor Henry Preserved Smith, I >.!>.. 
writes: "I think your book will have great value as a contribution to a really historical understanding of the 
Bible." Professor Lewis B. Paton, of Hartford Theological Seminary, writes: " I think you have guarded your 
position very carefully; and it seems to me a very satisfactory and convincing presentation of the subjcrt " 
Lester F. Ward, Professor of Sociology in Brown University, and Edward A. Ross, Professor of Sociology in the 
University of Wisconsin, write that the book conforms to our best modern knowledge of social science. It is a 
new disclosure of the interweaving of higher criticism and sociology. No serious worker in the field of tln--<- 
problems can afford to be without it.

European Beginnings of American History 

By ALICE M. ATKINSON Illustrated $1.00 

Miss Atkinson's new bock makes it clear to the child that the beginnings of American ways will be found far back in 
the story of the world. In a simple and vivid narrative, England has been made the connecting link between America 
and those European countries which have influenced our history. Primitive man, Rome and Greece, the Northmen, 
the Church, and the Crusades enter in this way, as well as mediaeval life in town and country.

THE DRAMA PLAYERS IN CHICAGO. 

After a career checkered with lights and shad- 
ows, the Drama Players, under the direction of 
Mr. Donald Robertson, and the joint manage- 
ment of the Chicago Theatre Society and the 
Messrs. Shubert, have ended their ten weeks' 
season in Chicago, and the time has come for a 
survey of their work as a whole. Although the 
enterprise originated in Chicago, and was made 
possible by the pledges secured here last summer, 
through Mr. Robertson's personal solicitation, 
toward a guaranty fund that should provide for 
the Society's share of the expenses, the Drama 
Players opened their season in the East, giving 
performances in New York and other cities, for 
several weeks before their appearance here. 
When they reached Chicago, and gave their first 
performance on the fifth of February, they were 
equipped with three tested and seasoned pro- 
ductions. Since that time they have rehearsed 
and produced six more plays, all of which repre- 
sents an amount of work which, considering the 
fact that most of the members of the company 
had been accustomed to go through a whole 
season with a single part, taxed their energies 
pretty severely. The work was much more diffi- 
cult than that of the average stock company, 
which rehearses a new play every week, because 
the plays given by such companies come to them 
with all the "business" worked out the en- 
trances and the groupings, and all the matters 
of stage technique are already indicated in the 
manuscript. But the Drama Players had to 
work with new material, and create from the 
bare text the living form of the play. A pro- 
duction made under these conditions means a 
degree of effort, and a confronting of difficult 
problems, which are never demanded of the ordi- 
nary stock players. There is no tradition to 
guide, and consequently one must be improvised, 
which is a more serious matter than the memo- 
rizing of the parts. Nothing but the most har- 
monious action and the most cordial spirit of 
cooperation could have made possible the smooth 
adjustment which has been so striking a feature 
of these nine productions. 

The following list of the plays will serve to 
show how much of this pioneer work had to be 
done: 

" The Maternal Instinct," by Messrs. Robert 
Her rick and Harrison Rhodes.

" La Bottega del Gaffe"," by Goldoni.

It will be observed that the three plays of Ameri- 
can authorship which head the list were absol- 
utely new to the stage, while the five translations 
from foreign languages were taken up with noth- 
ing but the indications of the printed text for a 
guide. Whatever stage tradition exists concern- 
ing them was inaccessible to Mr. Robertson and 
his associates, yet in no case was the performance 
halting or lacking in unity. Considering these 
difficulties, it means a good deal when we say that 
the performances were in the highest degree sat- 
isfactory, being characterized by both assurance 
and finish. Such good ensemble acting has not 
often been seen on any stage, and the artistic 
triumph of the company has been remarkable, al- 
though perhaps no greater than we had a right to 
expect from the fine directive intelligence of Mr. 
Robertson and the tested ability of such accom- 
plished players as those who assumed the heavy 
responsibilities of the repertoire. The names of 
Miss Hedwig Reicher, Miss Effie Shannon, Miss 
Charlotte Granville, Miss Renee Kelly, Mr. 
Herbert Kelcey, Mr. Sheldon Lewis, Mr. Lionel 
Belmore, Mr. Edward Emery, and Mr. Hylton 
Allen are indeed a guaranty of good acting, yet 
whatever they may be as individual performers, 
the total of their achievement was something 
much more than the total of their several abilities, 
and provided something like a revelation to their 
audiences. Instead of presenting a central figure, 
artificially forced into prominence, and encircled 
by inadequate and perfunctory satellites, each of 
these plays gave us a succession of natural group- 
ings, in which each character assumed its full 
value, and from which staginess and the con- 
ventional trickery of the trade were noticeably 
absent. Such an exhibition of good acting, if 
given time enough to impress itself upon the 
public, is sure to win the practical encourage- 
ment without which no ideal enterprise, unless 
supported by public or private endowments, can 
long endure. 

It has been a frequent observation of specta- 
tors who found the plays, as such, not particu- 
larly interesting, that almost any kind of a play 
would be worth seeing in the hands of such 
actors as these. And it must be confessed that 



the actors have had to struggle with some pretty 
poor material. The glaring fault of the pro- 
gramme resulted from the determination of the 
committee of managers to be patriotic at all 
costs. In deciding to produce three plays of 
American authorship before there were any 
such plays in sight, they committed themselves 
to a policy which proved disastrous in its con- 
sequences, besides being a departure from the 
fundamental principle of the enterprise. The 
Society was formed, not to take chances with 
untried material, but to present works of ap- 
proved merit and unquestionable significance. 
It had the entire literature of the modern drama 
from Shakespeare to Shaw from which to 
choose, and it deliberately wasted one-third of 
its energies in a futile attempt to foist three 
new American plays upon a confiding public. 
Now, broadly speaking, no plays have ever been 
produced in America which are worthy of being 
included in any list of such masterpieces as it 
was the avowed intention of the Society to pro- 
duce ; what, then, was the likelihood of suitable 
plays turning up among the manuscripts sub- 
mitted for examination? The management 
might be taking chances, from the box-office 
standpoint, with Moliere and Goldoni, or with 
Ibsen and Hervieu, or with a score of other 
playwrights whose place in dramatic literature 
is too secure to be disputed, but they would 
have incurred no artistic risk, and would have 
planted themselves upon entirely safe ground, 
if they had resolutely eschewed all toying with 
experimental matter. The organization was 
based upon a definite ideal purpose, and if its 
professions meant anything at all, they meant 
an effort to attract the public to approved works 
of a high literary value. They certainly did not 
mean any attempt to compete with the com- 
mercial theatre in the exploitation of novelties. 
The actual perversion of the original plan offers 
a striking illustration of the folly of entrusting 
its execution to a committee of many minds, 
and of deciding by vote the plays that should 
make up the list. The result was a departure 
from the singleness of aim which was absolutely 
imperative, and all the confusion that comes 
from compromise, and working at cross- pur- 
poses, and the effort to reconcile conflicting 
views. 

Of the three American plays selected, two 
proved to be dismal failures. They were thin, 
loose- jointed, and amateurish, and the public 
refused to have them on any terms. After the 
first night of each, when all the supporters of 
the enterprise rallied to its standard, the audi-

ences dwindled almost to the vanishing point, 
and they were withdrawn as quite hopeless. 
All the eare expended upon their production, 
and the remarkably fine acting of which they 
received the benefit could not make them go, 
and it became plainly evident that the spark of 
dramatic vitality was not in them. The third, 
Mr. Webster's "June Madness," achieved a 
considerable measure of success. It proved to 
be a good play of the type that attracts audi- 
ences to the commercial theatre, although we 
should hardly call it the kind of play which 
came within the scope of the Society's endeavors. 
Its matter was contentious and aroused excited 
discussion, which was all to the good as far as 
the box-office receipts were concerned, but it 
served in no way to emphasize the distinctive 
character of the enterprise with which it was 
associated. It served rather to indicate that 
the Drama Players were merely trying to do 
what the other theatres were doing, and many 
people were puzzled, by this and by several 
other productions, to understand how the de- 
clared objects of the Society were being fur- 
thered. The Moliere, Goldoni, and Ibsen plays 
were clearly within its province, as were, some- 
what less obviously, the plays by Hervieu, Gia- 
cosa, and Pinero. If, for example, the remaining 
places in the programme had been filled by 
works of such dramatists as Bjornson, Haupt- 
mann, Sudermann, Maeterlinck, Drachmann, 
Oehlenschlager, and Echegaray, or even by ex- 
amples of Elizabethan Drama or old English 
Comedy, the Society would have made a far 
more definite stand for the principles upon 
which it rested its claims for public and private 
support. It is, however, gratifying to note that 
the works of the greatest intrinsic worth, the 
plays by Moliere, Goldoni, and Ibsen, were par- 
ticularly successful in their appeal, and that the 
Ibsen play, indeed, proved to be about the best 
drawing-card in the entire repertory. The les- 
son from these facts is surely plain, and we 
trust that it will be heeded in the future. 

The total receipts for the season have been 
enough to let the guarantors off with the pay- 
ment of about fifty per cent of the sums pledged 
by them. This is not a bad outcome for the first 
season of what was confessedly an experimental 
enterprise. The Society had the cordial support 
of the newspaper press, of the Drama League, 
and of many clubs and other agencies of opinion. 
When we consider the stone wall of apathy and 
public indifference which stands in the way of 
any effort for the betterment of a public taste 
demoralized, as ours has been, in its artistic out- 



look, it is surprising that so evident a breach was 
made by this little band of reformers at the first 
assault. As compared with the ill-starred ven- 
ture of Chicago's New Theatre of four years ago, 
something like a triumph has been scored by the 
new undertaking, while the losses are insignifi- 
cant when set beside those of the more recent 
New York enterprise. We hope that the work 
thus inaugurated will go on, winning its way by 
an unshaken faith in its ideals, and profiting by 
a realization of its lapses from the straight path. 
The public is always suspicious of being practised 
upon for its own good, and there is no doubt 
that the Chicago Theatre Society has presented 
its cause in a way calculated to arouse such sus- 
picions. This feeling has yet to be overcome, 
and with it the attitude which is influenced by 
the cynic with his armory of cheap and malicious 
witticisms. Despite all adverse influences, the 
tide of interest in a rehabilitated stage is steadily 
rising in this country, and the wave which bears 
upon its crest the work of the Drama Players 
is moved by the irresistible forces which control 
the larger movement. 



CAS UAL COMMENT. 

ONE OF STEVENSON'S "ENCHANTED CIGAR- 
ETTES" the books one loves to dream of writing 
was his autobiography. That he did actually 
begin the enterprise is evidenced by a manuscript 
now in the possession of Mr. H. E. Widener, the 
well-known collector of Philadelphia. It was writ- 
ten in San Francisco, when Stevenson was thirty 
years of age, and covers only the earliest childhood 
memories. The manuscript is in ink on twenty- 
three pages of an ordinary quarto notebook. Ref- 
erences to the document are found in Mr. Graham 
Balfour's Life of Stevenson, but it has never before 
been printed in full. This prefatory paragraph has 
little of the customary Stevensonian ring: 

" I have the more interest in beginning these memoirs 
where and how I do, because I am living absolutely alone in 
San Francisco, and because from two years of anxiety and, 
according to the doctors, a touch of malaria, I may say I am 
altogether changed into another character. After weeks in 
this city, I know only a few neighboring streets ; I seem to 
be cured of all my adventurous whims and even of human 
curiosity, and am content to sit here by the fire and await 
the course of fortune. Indeed, I know myself no longer, 
and as I am changed in heart, I hope I have the more chance 
to look back impartially on all that has come and gone hereto- 
fore. There is, after all, no truer sort of writing than what 
is to be found in autobiographies, and certainly none more 
entertaining." 

Stevenson tells us that his first introduction to litera- 
ture was when his uncle, David Stevenson, offered 
a prize of twenty shillings to the family circle for 
the best history of Moses. His own version of the 
history of Moses, he tells us, "was copiously illus- 
trated by the author in a very free style. In these

pictures each Israelite was represented with a pipe 
in hi- mouth, cheering the desert miles." The follow- 
ing is a caustic bit of criticism, evidently inspired 
by the late Sir William Gilbert's stage caricatures 
of elderly unmarried women: 

" I think I was bom with a sense of what is dne to age, 
for the more 1 interrogate my recollections the more traces 
do I find of that respect struggling with the dislike of what 
is old and then seemed to me to be ugly. Of all the cruel 
things in life the cruellest, it may be, is the departure of 
all beauty from those who have been the desired mothers 
mod mistresses of men in a former generation. Pagans like 
Horace, derils like Villon, and yet he was a devil with a 
dash of the angelic were it only in his wings, and simple 
crass vulgarians like Gilbert, so much worse than the worst 
of the devilish, take an opportunity for some cheap effect of 
art from these distressing changes. I thank God, when I 
was a child I knew a higher decency." 

It is to be hoped that this interesting document in 
its entirety may some day be made available to all 
lovers of R. L. 8. Meanwhile, we imagine, each of 
the forty-five copies of Mr. Widener's edition would 
bring something more than its weight in gold in 
the auction rooms. ... 

EXPERIENCES OF A PUBLISHER'S READER go to fill 
some of the most entertaining pages of Mr. J. Henry 
Harper's historical and reminiscent volume, "The 
House of Harper," reviewed at length elsewhere in 
our last issue. It is to be noted, as correcting a preva- 
lent misapprehension, that the mere typewriting of a 
manuscript will do little to insure its favorable recep- 
tion. There is a good deal of illegible and illiterate 
typewriting. " A handwritten manuscript," declares 
Mr. Harper, "is in some respects more satisfactory 
than a typewritten one, for it contains some indication 
of the author's character." Further on he writes: 
Although the French have a proverb that it is not 
necessary to eat the whole of an egg to know that 
it is bad, many amateurs think themselves unfairly 
used if their manuscript is not read from the first 
to the last word. It is a favorite device to lay traps 
to catch the reader, and so prove that he has not 
done his duty by the manuscript. The commonest of 
these is to reverse certain pages in loose-sheet manu- 
script. If these are not turned to their proper posi- 
tion it follows that they have not been read. Other 
would-be authors will lightly gum together the cor- 
ners of two pages, or lay pressed leaves or bits of 
bright-colored worsted between the sheets, which, if 
undisturbed on the return of the manuscript, are con- 
vincing evidence to them that the story has not been 
examined. Manuscripts are frequently sent to pub- 
lishers which have already been declined more than 
once by them. The title may possibly be changed, 
but even that precaution is not always taken ; these 
authors evidently assuming that publishers have 
neither memory nor system." A particularly daring 
but unsuccessful fraud is worth citing. "The most 
extraordinary example of literary imposture that 
ever came to Franklin Square was a manuscript writ- 
ten in longhand, with numerous erasures and inter- 
lineations all the earmarks of a genuine piece of 
work. The subject-matter seemed oddly reiuini- 



cent, although the names and localities were strange. 
Another page or two settled the question; the book 
was nothing else than Mary Shelley's famous ' Frank- 
enstein.' Kvidently the ambitious author had found 
an old copy of the book tucked away in a dusty 
corner of some neglected library, and had been im- 
pressed by the somber power and horror of the tale. 
The book was an old one, and the impostor evidently 
concluded that it had long since been forgotten. 
with infinite labor, the whole thing had been copied 
in longhand, with the substitution of American names 
of persons and places for the originals." Such are 
some of the futile devices of those would-be authors 
whose lack of invention reminds one of Pope's fam- 
ous couplet: 

" You beat your pate, and fancy wit will come ; 
Knock as yon please, there 's nobody at home." 



LIBRARY BENEFACTIONS IN 1911, according to 
the Bulletin " of the American Library Association, 
assumed unprecedented proportions. The total of 
gifts and bequests in money to American libraries 
was more than three and one-third million dollars, 
which is nearly a million and a half more than was 
given in the preceding year; and of this handsome 
total Mr. Andrew Carnegie gave nearly two and 
one-third million dollars, or more than twice what 
he gave in 1910. One hundred and thirty-six towns 
and cities in this country and twenty-eight in Canada 
were the recipients of his bounty. The middle West 
and the South and the province of Ontario profited 
most largely by his generosity. Besides money, the 
year's record of gifts includes sixty-five thousand 
volumes, six sites for library buildings, and seven 
buildings given for library purposes. Prominent men- 
tion should be made of the splendid gift of Americana 
from Mr. Edward E. Ayer of Chicago to the New- 
berry Library, whose recently-issued Report says, 
in part, of this remarkable collection : " No general 
statement can do justice to its value, no general de- 
scription can adequately set forth its importance to 
historical investigators. It may, however, be said 
with confidence, that no serious student or writer 
who is concerned with the discovery, colonization, 
and settlement of North America, the history, lan- 
guages, manners, and customs of the North Ameri- 
can Indians, or the history, etc., of the Hawaiian and 
Philippine Islands, can afford to overlook the rich 
store of original materials, printed, manuscript, and 
pictorial, which the Ayer collection contains." There 
are said to be more than thirty-three thousand items 
in the collection, which has been placed in specially 
equipped rooms in the Newberry library building, 
there to remain as a visible and useful monument to 
the giver's scholarship, public spirit, and generosity. 
. 

THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN A "BOOK" AND A 

"VOLUME " AND A " PAMPHLET," a rather vague one 
to most readers, is indicated briefly in an appendix 
to the current Newberry Library Report (which, by 
the way, is a brief and hu.-sines.s-like and encour- 
aging record of the year's progress under Mr.

William N. C. Carlton's administration). The defi- 
nitions to be quoted here were made to meet the 
Newberry Library's needs, and may not commend 
themselves to every librarian; but they are at least 
suggestive and may help toward the general adop- 
tion of some sort of clear and definite rule that shall 
do away with certain present ambiguities. "The 
term 'volume' is used in the sense of a collection of 
sheets comprising more than one hundred pages. 
It is distinguished from ' part ' by having a title- 
page of its own and by being a principal subdivision 
of a work. 'Volume' in the sense of a 'binding,' 
enclosing several volumes, pamphlets, numbers, or 
parts, is called a 'book.' Several volumes or pam- 
phlets may be bound together in one ' book.' . . . An 
appendix, index, or supplement with an individual 
title-page is treated like a volume. The term 'pam- 
phlet ' is used in the sense of a collection of sheets com- 
prising one hundred pages or less (and not a serial), 
whether bound individually or with others. The 
term 'pamphlet' is not applied, however, to quarto 
and folio publications ; these are counted as volumes. 
In its ordinary sense of an unbound collection of a 
few sheets fastened together, the term 'pamphlet' 
has no significance in the Newberry Library, be- 
cause no pamphlets are placed permanently upon 
the shelves unbound. 'Pamphlet' is distinguished 
from ' number ' (of a serial) by being an individual 
or independent publication." It is indeed a far 
cry from this to the etymological meaning of volume 
(or parchment roll) and book (an inscribed beechen 
tablet) and pamphlet (or palme-fueillet or paume- 
feuillet, or leaflet to be held in the hand) a tran- 
sition for which the printing press is chiefly 
responsible. ... 

PROFESSOR MURRAY ON THE GREEK DRAMA drew 
a distinguished and an appreciative audience to his 
Lowell Institute lectures. To illustrate his scholarly 
and yet not unpopular style of public lecture, his hu- 
mor and fancy and graceful wit, let us quote a few 
words from his opening address on the Greek chorus. 
" If we do not understand it, we cannot understand 
the three great dramatists. Now, what is the diffi- 
culty? The chorus is completely undramatic, says the 
average critic ; it breaks the drama. When the hero- 
ine is engaged in some plot, arranging to murder her 
husband, or taking some such step for the good of the 
community, then fifteen visitors happen in. Some- 
times they have a reason for coming, sometimes not. 
Usually they are homogeneous: if there is one old 
gentleman, then there will be fifteen old gentlemen. 
And it doesn't help matters if the fifteen visitors 
begin to dance." But, after all, the vaudeville per- 
formance on the part of the venerable gentlemen, 
or of whomsoever the chorus consists, is not out of 
harmony with the spirit of the occasion. The dance 
is no mere tripping of the light fantastic toe; the 
whole body rhythmically moves to express the over- 
flow of emotion for which verbal utterance is inade- 
quate. The chorus raises us to the higher world of 



spiritual beauty and lofty speculation, that " spiritual 
world to which lyrical emotion exalts the inward eye, 
where metaphor is the very stuff of life." So genial 
and well-equipped an exponent of "the glory that 
was Greece " has not come to us from abroad since 
Professor Mahaffy's memorable visit. 



ONE TRAINING FOR SUCCESSFUL AUTHORSHIP, 

notably uncommon and hardly to be commended, 
was that of Karl May, the German writer of tales 
of adventure for boys. His recent death at Dres- 
den in his seventieth year calls attention to the fact 
that his earlier life was devoted to highway robbery 
and other forms of illegal acquisition of property, 
and that he was not unfamiliar with the interior 
aspect of jails and prisons. A cave in the vicinity 
of Dresden was the young bandit's retreat, whence 
he and a confederate sallied forth to terrorize the 
neighborhood. At last the constituted authorities 
made this exciting mode of life a little too hazard- 
ous for May, and he disappeared from view. Four 
years later a gentleman of good looks and distin- 
guished bearing made his appearance in Dresden 
and applied himself to the writing of such interest- 
ing stories of adventure for the local newspapers 
that the great publishing houses solicited the pro- 
ducts of his pen for book publication. The result was 
that hundreds of tales, both original and translated 
from the Arabian, Turkish, Persian, and Chinese, 
were produced by him. Our own far West, with 
its redskin braves, formed the scene of some of Herr 
May's stirring tales. In later life he became reli- 
gious, figured prominently in the Roman Catholic 
church of Saxony, and wrote tracts for the conver- 
sion of the heathen all the while amassing wealth 
from his work in fiction, and growing in the respect 
and good opinion of his community. 

THE FATE OF HIM WHO WILL NOT READ pre- 

sents itself, rightly enough, to the editor of " The 
Newarker " as something lamentable to contemplate. 
Business failure as well as personal chagrin lies in 
ambush for the heedless and self-willed person who 
persists in making the journey down life's highway 
with no packet of literature, frequently renewed, in 
his luggage. We are reminded that within the last 
few years the greatest business corporation in the 
world has wasted thousands of dollars in costly 
experiments in steel-making, whereas if the officials 
concerned had read the text-books and periodicals 
of their branch of industry they would have found 
in plain print just the information (gathered and 
written down by others) that they needed. They 
do these things better in Germany. There the 
product of the printing-press is valued at something 
like its true worth ; and your bespectacled German, 
with his nose in a book, is somehow learning how to 
get ahead of his competitors in many of the races 
entered by the nations of the world. With the justi- 
fiable pride of an elert and energetic librarian, Mr. 
Dana concludes his editorial on the prime necessity

BOOKS, BOOKSHOPS, AND LIBRARIES IN AUSTRALIA 

picture themselves in some imaginations as rivalling 
the snakes of Ireland in scarcity. Hence the surprise 
with which at least a few readers must have learned 
from an article in the March " Book Monthly, "signed 
by Katharine S. Prichard, that "the facilities for 
reading are not in England as great as they are in 
Australia," and that "it is easier to get a classic of 
English literature in the back blocks of Australia 
than in many a rural district of England." Further- 
more, "a mining camp scarcely emerges from its 
canvas coverings before it is demanding books ; and 
a place for its Town Hall and Free Library, or Me- 
chanics' Institute, is marked on the plan of the new 
town as soon as it has one." Innumerable smaller 
circulating libraries and book clubs supplement the 
activities of the public libraries, and " the appetite for 
books, fostered by the public libraries, is in the end 
appeased by the bookshops." Cole's Book Arcade 
in Melbourne has the name of being the most won- 
derful bookshop in the world. It is a bookshop and 
a thoroughfare in one, where the book-lover may 
ramble and loiter and browse from early morn till 
late at night, and no one importunes him to buy. The 
consuming hunger for books, which only those who 
have lived in the backwoods and the "back blocks" 
can know in its greatest intensity, and which in not 
a few instances seems to vary inversely as the square 
of the population, has evidently been felt by our 
Australian cousins. 



LITERATURE AND THE STAGE. 

(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 
Of late years there has been a steady procession 
of novelists towards the theatre. The late Oscar 
Wilde and Mr. George Bernard Shaw may be said 
to have started the movement; but the authors of 
" Dorian Gray " and of "Cashel Byron's Profession " 
could hardly, perhaps, be classed in the first rank of 
novelists. They belonged to literature as a whole, 
not to any specific branch of it; and it is probable 
that they came to the stage because they were on the 
look-out for some fresh form more suitable to their 
qualities than that of fiction. But there followed 
Mr. J. M. Barrie, to the astonishment of the critics, 
for the historian of Thrums was almost the last man 
that appeared a likely candidate for high honors on 
the stage. It did not seem possible that he could 
get that freakish humor of his across the footlights. 
But he did; and with an astounding success. Mr. 
Barrie may be said to have given the theatre-goer a 
new sensation. The stalls learned quickly to enjoy 



his sly Scottish unexpectedness, the sudden stabs of 
pathos that gave an additional zest to the quaint 
humor. They took Barrie to their hearts as a dra- 
matist: at one time he had as many as three plays 
running in London simultaneously to crowded 
houses; while his "Peter Pan" became a hardy an- 
nual, regularly expected and as regularly patronized 
every Christmas season. 

To Mr. J. M. Barrie succeeded Mr. Somerset 
Maugham, a novelist of some eminence, though per- 
haps of no very great circulation. His "Liza of 
Lambeth," however, had obtained a certain success, 
at a time when fiction was concerning itself with 
mean streets and the slums of great cities. Mr. 
Maugham proved to be a dramatist of the more ordi- 
nary type, a producer of "social " plays, not widely 
different from the work of such hardened playwrights 
as Sutro or Henry Arthur Jones. But there was a 
freshness about Mr. Maugham's work that com- 
mended it to the public ; and in a short time he, too, 
had the pleasure of seeing three plays from his pen 
running simultaneously in London. For a time man- 
agers competed eagerly for his work ; now, perhaps, 
the novelty of the thing has worn off a little, or, 
possibly, playgoers are become more serious. But 
Mr. Maugham, like Mr. Barrie, may now be said to 
have definitely abandoned fiction for the drama. 

There are a host of others who. without entirely 
deserting their first love, dally with the stage. It is 
a fascinating gamble : even a moderate success means 
so much more, from the money point of view, than 
can generally be obtained from the publisher for the 
mere book rights of a novel. The first step is gen- 
erally taken when some enterprising cobbler of plays 
approaches the author of a successful novel with an 
offer to adapt it for theatrical production. Commonly 
the offer is accepted, for it is interesting to see what 
will happen, and a half share in the proceeds seems 
good pay for practically no work. Even if it is not 
accepted, the seed is sown : before long the author will 
find himself attempting an adaptation of his own. 
Once permit the dramatic bacillus to obtain a lodg- 
ment in the brain, and it multiplies as swiftly as the 
bacillus of any other known disease. Mr. Anthony 
Hope Hawkins fell by permitting the late Mr. Edward 
Rose to fit " The Prisoner of Zenda " to the exigencies 
of the stage : since that time he has never regarded 
the writing of fiction with anything more than a toler- 
ant regard, his real love is the stage, and his work 
has not improved in consequence. Sir Arthur Conan 
Doyle underwent, in like fashion, a severe attack of 
dramatic measles, induced in the first instance by 
the dramatization of *' Sherlock Holmes." He is now, 
happily, almost recovered: he has indeed announced 
his intention of devoting himself once more to the 
writing of books which should be good news for 
all lovers of healthy fiction. But while the fever was 
on him, he contrived to produce at least five plays; 
of which one, "The House of Temperley," ran for a 
considerable time. Perhaps his best work in this field 
was "Waterloo," the little adaptation that he made

from one of his short stories for the late Sir Henry 
Irving. This is still revived from time to time. 

It was, I imagine, the example of J. M. Barrie 
and Somerset Maugham that started so many of our 
other novelists on the new road to fame and fortune. 
Mr. A. E. W. Mason, the author of "Clementina" 
and formerly an actor himself, tried his hand at an 
adaptation : Mr. W. W. Jacobs, the darling of so many 
readers of the "Strand Magazine, "produced "Beauty 
and the Barge," but has not repeated the experiment. 
Mr. E. W. Hornung, the ingenious founder of a 
school of burgling fiction, dramatized "Raffles" with 
conspicuous success, and followed it up with " Stin- 
garee," which met with no success at all. Mr. F. 
Anstey Guthrie brought out " The Man from Blank- 
ley's," and turned his "Brass Bottle" into a play; 
while Mr. H. A. Vachell dramatized one of his pop- 
ular novels in "Her Son." Indeed, so great has 
been the rush of late that it is impossible to mention 
all the names that recur to the mind. Enterprising 
managers have drawn the most unlikely customers 
into their net: even Mr. Henry James has been 
mangled for the delectation of the gallery, as well 
as the late George Meredith. Only the other day 
Mr. Zangwill's "New Religion" was produced, and 
withdrawn ; while Mr. Eden Philpotts has succeeded 
in offending the censor with his " Secret Woman " 
thereby, no doubt, sending a new host of readers to 
the book from which his play was drawn. For there 
is this point about the dramatization of novels, that 
at the worst the production of your play means a 
new edition of your book, while those who have read 
the novel have a certain curiosity to see how it will 
appear upon the stage. 

There are at the present moment an even larger 
number than usual of novelists' plays being per- 
formed in London. Mr. R. S. Hichens has made 
a successful entry into the theatrical arena with 
"Bella Donna," which seems likely to have as long 
a run as anything now playing. The late George du 
Maurier's "Trilby" is enjoying a revival, in which 
Sir Herbert Tree is once more proving his strength 
as an actor of melodrama. " Trilby " is one of the 
few instances of a successful novel making an even 
more successful play : it has two fine characters, and 
the public like the free and easy Bohemian life of 
the artists' quarter. But the theatre is a lottery, 
and it is impossible to tell what will bear transplant- 
ing. "The Scarlet Pimpernel," by the Baroness 
Orczy, has been revived again and again ; but there 
was certainly not much in the book to suggest the 
remarkable success of the adaptation. There is not 
a character in the piece, with the possible exception 
of the French spy. But there is a sort of bustling 
liveliness about the action, and there are some pretty 
dresses in the scene at the court of the Prince Regent. 

Mr. Arnold Bennett is one of the latest recruits 
lent by literature to the stage. He has one play 
running now, and another has just been taken off. 
As might be judged from his novels, he shows plenty 
of cleverness, and his dialogue is as good as need 



be ; but I doubt whether he really possesses the dra- 
matic sense. Still, Mr. Bennett will no doubt ac- 
quire this quality, if he does not already quite see 
his situations from the theatrical standpoint. He 
has confidence in himself, and great perseverance. 
At an early period in his life as an author he had 
mapped out for himself the course he meant to pur- 
sue, and he followed it with a single mind until he 
achieved success. He declared his intention of writ- 
ing a certain number of stories that would sell, inter- 
spersing with them a few that should make his name 
as a serious novelist. Many of us have had this idea 
before, but I can recall no other instance of any 
writer carrying it out with such eminently satisfac- 
tory results. The man who could do this ought to 
have a good chance of conquering the theatrical 
world, and I should not be in the least surprised to 
see Mr. Arnold Bennett become one of our most 
popular dramatists, when once he has found out 
what the public really wants. 

Mr. Rudolf Besier has recently adapted for the 
stage yet another novel " Kipps," by Mr. H. G. 
Wells. I do not think Mr. Wells has made any 
previous appearance on the stage, and it seems 
improbable that this venture will give him much 
encouragement to proceed. It is a pity that Mr. 
Wells did not try his own hand at the adaptation, 
instead of employing a trained dramatist for the 
purpose. For the quality that made " Kipps " as a 
book is entirely absent from the present stage ver- 
sion. The little shop assistant is employed merely as 
the central figure of a farce : it is his business to be 
ridiculous, and the humanity, the little sympathetic 
touches, that gave life to Mr. Wells's charming novel, 
are lost. The present version is a vulgarization of 
a fine story. But I doubt very much whether the 
work of this author is suited to the theatre. Mr. 
Wells has so much to say, and he finds it so difficult 
to leave anything out. ''The New Machiavelli" 
was spoiled as a work of art by the wideness and 
diversity of its range : it might have been named 
"Wells on the World in General." And the nov- 
elist has infinitely more latitude than the playwright. 
Yet, on the other hand, Mr. Wells has ideas : he 
thinks for himself, and is always changing his point 
of view; he would indubitably prove an interesting 
recruit to the theatre. It is conceivable that he 
might, with Mr. Bernard Shaw and his brother 
novelist Mr. John Galsworthy, form a small band of 
dramatists who should deal on the stage with some- 
thing more vital than the trivialities of our customary 
social comedy. 

Mr. Galsworthy's latest play, " The Pigeon," was 
not a success. But he has proved his ability to 
write for the stage, and there is food for thought in 
everything he writes. " Justice " was universally 
acknowledged to be a very fine piece of work : it 
will certainly be seen again. Mr. Galsworthy has 
been attracted to the theatre because he has some- 
thing to say, not from a mere desire to make money 
easily. He is not of those who seek to produce

stage versions of their novels. And, so far at any 
rate, his association with the stage has not spoiled 
his writing. I am inclined to think that this is the 
worst effect of coquetting with the drama : it is apt 
to make the novelist write theatrically. Mr. Wells, 
I remember, once wrote an amusing short story 
about a man who was ruined by becoming a dra- 
matic critic. The tricks of the trade crept into his 
daily life : he could not resist the temptation to act : 
he accentuated his emotions until he became the 
laughingstock of his friends and an object of 
amused contempt to the girl he loved. The same 
danger, in a way, hangs over the innocent writer of 
fiction who is seduced by the figures of the box- 
office and the undeniable charm of seeing his char- 
acters tread the boards in actual flesh and blood. 
He begins to see everything from the point of view 
of the stalls and the dress circle : he cannot resist 
the opportunity of bringing in an effective piece of 
business, or of concluding a chapter with a dramatic 
curtain. Novelists like Mr. Hall Caine, who have 
acquired the habit of writing with a view to subse- 
quent production on the stage, have thus a tendency 
to force the emotional note, to pitch everything 
in too high a key. Certainly Mr. Galsworthy can- 
not be accused of this fault ; but then he keeps his 
fiction and his drama separate. And this, to my 
mind, should always be done. I am glad to see that 
Mr. H. A. VachelPs new play, soon to be produced, 
is a new work and not, like his former effort in this 
direction, a dramatized version of a novel.

COMMUNICA TION. 



A WORD FOR MAGAZINE VERSE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

A Philadelphia newspaper editor once asked the ques- 
tion, " What's the use of poetry, anyhow? " Doubtless 
many could enlighten the enquirer; yet in the process 
of enlightenment, if we are to believe certain critics, 
magazine verse would be dispensed with. According 
to these critics, magazine verse is just good enough for 
its obvious purpose: to "justify " pages, to fill up the 
flunks, the nooks. This attitude of good-natured toler- 
ance seems to be a general one among reviewers. 

It is certainly true that magazine verse plays a small 
part on the literary stage. Editors aver that there is 
little or no demand for it among their readers ; magazines 
certainly prosper without it; and in collected book form 
it rewards only the printer. Indeed, the situation looks 
bad for our poets and for magazine verse. 

But we have heard from the critic, the reviewer, the 
editors, and the poets themselves. Now why not have 
a word from a lover of verse, one who buys certain 
magazines simply for the poetry they contain, and for 
no other reason ? Frankly, a lover of verse the present 
writer claims to be; and his ideas muy be interesting if 
not enlightening. 

Where are the lovers of verse ? One would expect 
the echoes to answer, "Where?" The true answer is, 



nevertheless, that they are everywhere. By way of 
proof it can be suggested to the doubter that be note 
the deluge of inquiries for facts concerning jmcin-. \s Im-Ii 
flood the offices of such newspapers as maintain a depart- 
ment to answer such inquiries. Let him note, also, the 
poems that are re-copied over tin- country iu the news- 
papers not the cheap doggerel of the daily "joke" 
column, but serious and thoughtful verse from the best 
magazines. Then, too, the doubter might try to discover 
the home without its scrap-book of verse. Personal 
observation has shown that there are many who buy 
magazines not because of the fiction writer whose name 
glories on the cover, but because on the contents page 
was listed in small type the name of a favorite poet or 
a goodly array of poems. 

To the immediate query, If there is such an array of 
poetry lovers, why are they not more often heard from? 
there is an answer. Those who read and enjoy magazine 
verse are not the kind who make much of the fact; the 
popularity of a poem cannot be tested by the number of 
letters of commendation that come into the editor's 
office. The reason lies in the fact that magazine verse 
is essentially lyrical, and therefore of a very intimate 
nature; it deals with individual thought and feeling, 
and is effective in just so far as it touches the individual 
mind and heart of the reader. The result is that a reader 
is not likely to reveal to an editor bis deep appreciation 
of a poem, he does not bare his intimacies to a stranger 
in this way. The poem that frames in expressive words 
the longing of a heart for a loved one will never bring 
a letter of gratitude to an editor, though it may have 
touched and been treasured by thousands of hearts. 

A fact which critics and reviewers never seem to take 
into consideration in their criticism of our magazine 
poets is that the lyrical nature of their work limits its 
appeal. Most magazine poems consist of only three or 
four stanzas ; and within such limits verse must be essen- 
tially subjective in thought, mode, and treatment. So 
a reader whose life is wholly or largely objective can 
never be interested by a lyric, though it were written 
by Israfel himself; such a person has nothing in him to 
respond to the intimate and tender beauty of a lyric 
poem: the wood of which he is made will not resound 
to the throb of the strings. 

The narrow confines of the lyric do not give the 
breadth and depth which great themes of large imagina- 
tive and intellectual character require; but the quality 
of the lyrical matter may be just as high in a poetic 
sense as that of greater import. A spring may be as 
perfect in purity and beauty as a lake. From a long 
and loving familiarity with the lyric writers of the Eliza- 
bethan, Romantic, and Victorian Periods of our litera- 
ture, I can turn to some of our current niHgazine poets 
and feel that I am reading work which ranks with that 
of the sweetest singers of the song-filled days of the 
past. I would even venture to mention the names of 
these poets, did I not feel that in doing so I were cross- 
ing the Bridge of the Open Heart into the critic's House 
of Ancient Conceptions. 

And so we who are lovers of verse will continue to 
read on, silent save for a voice out of the wilderness 
like mine, content to listen to the lutes that are singing 
clearly and sweetly from the " nooks in the magazines," 
heanng, above the honk of automobiles, the blasts of 
mills, the grind of wheels, and the frenzied babblings of 
factions, the still small voice of Song. \ \v. P.

CARDINAL, 



Some years ago, an able Protestant writer. 
Professor Charles Sarolea, warned us that we 
were not to expect too much from Mr. Wilfrid 
Ward's promised life of Newman. It would 
be, he assured us, " only an ' official ' and expur- 
gated life"; and he inquired, in italics, whether 
it was not a fact that at least one important letter 
of Newman's had been deliberately destroyed. 
We cannot know, of course, to how drastic a 
process of revision Mr. Ward's pages have been 
subjected by authority, but it seems unlikely 
that anything has been suppressed more "com- 
promising" than many things that have been 
included. There is no attempt whatever to con- 
ceal Newman's almost continuous unhappiness 
from the time he entered the Catholic Church 
until 1878, nor to gloss over the neglect with 
which he was treated by his superiors and its 
effect upon him. So far the most unsympa- 
thetic critic of his career may enjoy an easy 
triumph. But nothing, on the other hand, can 
be plainer than that, in spite of the agitations, 
much more than superficial, of almost his whole 
Catholic life, in spite of the waves and billows 
that, one after another, went over him, in the 
depths there was peace the peace, to be sure, 
of Purgatory, rather than that of Paradise, as he 
once intimates; but peace nevertheless, deep- 
based and unshakable. 

Almost from the beginning, his Catholicism 
was suspected by Catholics and Protestants 
alike. Not until he had written a sharp and 
rather uncivil letter to the newspapers did the 
rumor cease to recur that he was about to re- 
turn to the Anglican communion. He deplores 
his friend William George Ward's " never dying 
misgiving " that they were " in some substan- 
tial matter at variance," and "the vague, deep 
suspicions " that Ward had long cherished con- 
cerning him. These suspicions and misgivings 
were shared by great numbers of Catholics who 
were, unfortunately, in positions of authority, 
and they account very largely for the cloud 
under which Newman lived for long and weary 
years. Such an attitude on the part of timid 
men of commonplace minds (though it should 
be said in passing that Ward was neither timid 
nor commonplace) is intelligible enough towards 
a man of Newman's temper, who could walk

Wilfrid Ward. In two volumes. Illustrated. New York : 
Longmans, Green & Co. 



securely on giddy intellectual heights, with 
abysses of error yawning on either side of him, 
and who could so walk precisely because he per- 
ceived the abysses and their peril. Such men 
thought him headstrong, venturesome, scornful 
of the safe and beaten way. He thought them 
blind to the necessity of striking out a path that 
should allure more daring spirits than theirs to 
the heights which he, as firmly as they, believed 
to be the dwelling-place of Truth. 

There are many passages in these volumes that 
show how deeply Newman felt the disapproval 
of his fellow-Catholics. The pathetic letter in 
which he resumed his intercourse with Keble 
after seventeen years, the eagerness with which 
he renewed his Anglican friendships, show to 
what a degree he felt himself alone. In the 
midst of the suspicion and misunderstanding to 
which he was subjected, he wistfully looked back 
to his early home and his own people, away 
from the cheerless and alien world in which, for 
conscience' sake, he had taken up his abode. 
Not that he had not there also friendships of the 
utmost tenderness and intimacy. The touching 
close of the " Apologia " tells us how tender and 
how intimate those friendships were. But at 
best the atmosphere of his new home was not 
the warm, kindling atmosphere of Oxford days, 
when heart spoke indeed to heart, when all were 
"of one heart and of one soul," and had all 
intellectual things in common. Of one of these 
renewed friendships he writes: "It was a sad 
pleasure to me to find how very closely we agreed 
on a number of matters which have happened 
since we met. It was almost like two clocks 
keeping time." 

This isolation, this atmosphere of misunder- 
standing and suspicion, not to say hostility, this 
entire want of sympathy with his deepest hopes, 
make up the tragedy of Newman's Catholic life. 
And "tragedy" is not too strong a name to ap- 
ply to it. Intentionally or not, Mr. Ward has 
made him the hero of what is, considering the 
great importance of its issues, a tragic drama, in 
which his antagonist is the embodied suspicion 
of his superiors in the Church. Mr. Ward 
explicitly affirms that Newman's temperament, 
difficult as it was, does not account for the small 
success of his Catholic undertakings small, 
that is to say, in proportion to his effort and his 
powers. The cause, he says, " is to be sought 
rather in the action of his countrymen who op- 
posed him and in the circumstances of the time 
which gave them their opportunity." Here 
evidently is the very stuff of tragedy : a temper- 
ament unduly sensitive and perhaps impatient

compelled to collaborate for great ends with a 
body of men timid, suspicious, and even jealously 
hostile, in circumstances such as to make their 
hostility in the highest degree effective. His 
antagonists, be it understood, were not villains 
of melodrama. They were, almost without ex- 
ception, men of exalted aims and holy lives. It 
was a conflict of temperaments, a true psycho- 
logical tragedy. One by one, great undertak- 
ings into which he had put his highest hope and 
best effort were thwarted, sometimes by what 
seemed like harsh and arbitrary intervention, 
sometimes by an equally wounding neglect ; 
until at last, when he had all but ceased to strug- 
gle or to hope, he received that sudden and 
ample justification which, in the case of the suf- 
fering (Edipus at Colonus, Jebb finely calls 
tlit- divine amends." 

This is the true subject of these volumes, for 
Mr. Ward very properly gives little space to the 
events of Newman's life before 1845. They 
have been sufficiently dealt with in the " Apo- 
logia" and the Letters and Correspondence. 
Those who care for richer detail may seek it in 
the chroniques scandaleuses of Abbott. It 
is the Catholic Newman about whom, in spite 
of his Catholic writings, we were ignorant, and 
whom Mr. Ward has candidly and admirably 
unveiled. 

We are quite sure that the main interest of 
these memorable volumes will be the light which 
they throw on the question that will not down 
in the mind of any non-Catholic student and 
admirer of Newman : how far did his conversion 
prevent him from independent thought ? What 
was his real attitude from within towards that 
authority which, from without, so imposed it- 
self upon his imagination ? No one at this time 
of day is likely to accuse Newman of obscurant- 
ism or timidity. But how, practically, did he 
accommodate himself to the restrictions which, 
he firmly believed, it is the right of the Church 
to impose in intellectual matters ? This is evi- 
dently the question which Mr. Ward has set 
himself to answer, and which he has answered 
with candor and completeness. " The mystery 
of Newman," so far as a minute knowledge of 
his inner and outer life can clear it up, is no 
longer a mystery. We think it not too much 
to say that Mr. Ward has made Newman's atti- 
tude entirely intelligible and reasonable, unless 
perhaps it should seem unreasonable for such 
a man loyally to share the faith and hope of 
men in whose conduct reason apparently had 
so small a place. 

The signs of suspicion are manifest from the 



first. The hereditary Catholics of England, 
whose spirit had been well-nigh crushed out of 
them by the long oppression uinlcr which they 
had suffered, naturally regarded the aggressive 
enterprises of the distinguished convert with 
"jealous inertia." They perceived, moreover. 
as did others later, that his thinking did not 
run in familiar grooves, that while his results 
might be sound, his methods of arriving at 
them were unexpected. Or, as Perrone, the 
leading theologian at Rome, once phrased it, 
Newman looked at certain doctrinal questions 
not as we who have been brought up in the 
Catholic Faith from our childhood." " He 
meant, I think," writes Ambrose St. John to 
Newman, that u you viewed them (though with 
the best intentions) historically, as a person not 
wholly in the secret would do." Well, those 
who were " in the secret," whether by birth or 
initiation, first the " old Catholics " of En- 
gland, then the Irish bishops, then Manning, 
Ward, and Vaughan, then Propaganda saw 
to it that the thought and activity of this unac- 
countable mind should be confined within as nar- 
row limits as possible. Even in the matter of 
the cardinalate, which put an end to the long 
period of hostility, it is fairly clear, in spite of 
Mr. Ward's discretion, that Manning did little 
or nothing to further Newman's elevation, and, 
so far as passive resistance could do so, opposed 
it. Criticized and thwarted on every hand, it 
is little wonder that a man of Newman's tem- 
per became all but disheartened, ami that caustic 
comments escaped his tongue and pen. These 
comments Mr. Ward does right to print as a 
guarantee of good faith ; but, once read, they 
need not be repeated and may well be forgotten. 
No man ought to bear forever the burden of 
his own impatient speech, especially when that 
speech is so abundantly warranted. It proves 
neither that he was a bad Catholic nor a bad 
Christian, but only that he was a suffering, 
much-baffled man, whose personal dignity could 
be offended and whose anger could be roused. 
There is nothing very edifying about this part 
of the story, but then, except to persons who 
have no proper conception of " such a being as 
man in such a world as this," it is neither 
shocking nor surprising. The treasure of the 
Catholic Faith has been undoubtedly often con- 
tained in vessels of very ordinary clay ; but it 
is a treasure, for all that, and in Newman it 
had a vessel almost wholly worthy of it. One 
thing, too, should never be forgotten in reading 
these volumes. Beneath all the misunderstand- 
ings and resentments, there is a genuine desire 



1912.] 



THE DIAL 



311 



to do the will of God, to check the advance, 
not of free thought, but of infidelity, and to 
keep pure and whole in the hearts of men, in 
these distressful days, the "Faith once delivered 
to the Saints." 

It was Newman's supposed "liberalism," no 
doubt, that was the root of his troubles, his 
liberalism coupled with his attractiveness. The 
terror of his power is almost ludicrous. He 
himself, in his last days, said with a smile : " I 
think [Ward's] theory was that I was all the 
more dangerous because I was so attractive 
that I was a sort of siren of whose fascination all 
should beware." Talbot considered him "the 
most dangerous man in England." He was 
forbidden to establish the Oratory at Oxford 
because his presence would be sure to attract to 
that nursery of error the best Catholic youth of 
the three kingdoms. When such powers of fasci- 
nation were allied to such opinions, it was little 
wonder that he was feared by the Irish bishops, 
who, as he said, regarded " any intellectual man 
as being on the road to perdition." He wrote in 
1864 that the great obstacle to setting on foot a 
historical review was that, " unless one doctored 
all one's facts, one would be thought a bad Cath- 
olic." He severed his connection with "The 
Rambler" at the request of his bishop, who, 
by the way, was his staunch ally, and who based 
his request on the ground that " Catholics never 
had a doubt," and that it therefore " pained them 
to know that things could be considered doubtful 
which they had ever implicitly believed." In 
circumstances like these, a man of Newman's 
mental energy and intellectual conscience could 
hardly escape calumny. Yet his aims were mod- 
erate, his "liberalism," according to modern 
Protestant standards, very mild indeed. He 
feared to have the Church left behind in the 
march of thought. He wished her, in the per- 
son of her accredited teachers, to face the facts 
of the day. He believed that " the great prob- 
lem of the hour" was "to promote the influence 
of Catholic Christianity on modern civilization "; 
and to have any such influence the Church must 
at least perceive whither modern civilization is 
tending and fairly face its problems and its perils. 
In 1886, he sent to his biographer a memoran- 
dum in which he urged the necessity of drawing 
up a systematic statement of the chief points at 
issue between scientists and the Church, so that 
these points might be " candidly discussed among 
Catholic theologians and men of science with the 
sanction of Rome itself." " Such frank debate," 
he thought, " would result in the erection of an 
authority on the subjects in question which would 



inspire general confidence." But all that he in- 
sists upon is free and intelligent discussion. He 
is ready to submit absolutely and loyally to the 
decision of the Church. He is not a Modernist, 
though, by a singular fate, he is one of the 
fathers of Modernism, in both France and En- 
gland. There is, he wisely thought, a time to 
speak and a time to keep silence. The truth is 
dependent on no one man's advocacy. It can 
wait, for truth out of season is practically no 
truth at all. "I have always preached," he 
writes, " that things which are really useful, still 
are done, according to God's will, at one time, 
not at another; and that, if you attempt at a 
wrong time, what in itself is right, you may per- 
haps become a heretic or schismatic." And so, 
in concluding the Dublin University lectures, he 
urges his hearers to " trust the Church of God 
implicitly," to remember the difficulties of her 
task, the length of her experience, the greatness 
of her achievement. He begs them, in a word, 
to be patient like her, and to await the slow re- 
vealing of the mind of God. He was, in the best 
sense of the word, an opportunist, and this was 
the reason for his valiant opposition to the Vati- 
can decrees of 1870. He regarded the new 
definition of Infallibility as unnecessary and 
inopportune, and the means by which it was 
brought about as inviting " a stern Nemesis " 
upon the Church for the deeds of an "insolent 
and aggressive faction." He had long held the 
doctrine in a sane and moderate form, as the 
later pages of the "Apologia" testify. But he 
feared the effect of defining it, of making it 
de fide, upon the fortunes of the Church at so 
critical a juncture. He was stirred to anger and 
dismay at the flippant shortsightedness of Ward, 
who was quoted as saying that he "should like a 
new Papal Bull " he meant an " infallible " one 
"every morning with his Times at breakfast." 
On this extreme view, that the Pope could hardly 
speak except infallibly, one of the Fathers of 
the Oratory wittily observed that Ward and men 
like him ascribed to the Pope "a gift 'like that 
of Midas' touch of gold,' very wonderful, but 
very inconvenient." While the dogma was not 
affirmed in any such extreme form as Newman 
at first feared, the best he could say of it was 
that he was "pleased at its moderation that 
is, if the doctrine in question is to be defined at 
all." Thereafter he was silent, but his position 
was probably that of the Psalmist : " I held my 
tongue and spake nothing : I kept silence, yea, 
even from good words ; but it was pain and grief 
to me." It should, however, be remembered 
that in this instance it was only his sense of 



812

[April 16, 



expediency that he was obliged to submit, not 
his faith. 

Some of his unhappiness was due, it is 
evident, to unfortunate personal qualities, un- 
fortunate, that is, in the circumstances. From 
his childhood, he was cursed with an almost 
morbid sensitiveness to praise and blame, and 
this, Mr. Ward points out, often stood in his 
way. Where another man would have claimed 
his rights and insisted upon a hearing, Newman 
took refuge in a dignified, not a sulky, silence, 
when be found himself misunderstood or treated 
with discourtesy. He found it hard, as he said, 
" to wait at Episcopal doors " and to endure 
Episcopal manners. " I suppose it is what he 
learned at Rome," he says of one of the Irish 
bishops, alluding to the abrupt manners and 
high-handed ways that prevailed at the Curia 
and at Propaganda. For Pius IX. he felt the 
love as well as the loyalty of a son, but he found 
him surrounded by " second-rate people " who 
were not subjects of that supernatural guid- 
ance which is his prerogative." He viewed 
" with equanimity the prospect of a thorough 
routing-out of things at Rome," and he cherished 
the hope that " the Latin race will not always 
have a monopoly of the magisterium of Cathol- 
icism." He writes in his journal of 1860 that, 
next to the praise of God, he has sought the 
praise of his superiors, but that he has been 
" treated only with slight and unkindness "; he 
has been " misrepresented, backbitten, and 
scorned"; and he concludes that though they 
have a claim upon his obedience, they have none 
upon his " admiration or inward trust." 

This state of mind is the result not of thwarted 
ambition or of injured self-love, but of his eager 
desire to be of use to the Church for which he 
had sacrificed everything but his conscience and 
his love of the Truth. Often in his letters and 
journals the mournful reflection occurs that 
Rome is throwing him away. " When I am 
gone," he writes in 1859, " it will be seen per- 
haps that persons stopped me from doing a "'/// 
which I might have done." His small success 
was no doubt due in part also to a certain in- 
capacity for managing men. With all his fas- 
cination he was perhaps unfitted by nature to 
control others. One of his friends explains this 
on the ground that " he had too keen a sympathy 
for individuality to enforce the necessary drill." 
And indeed his results were always gained by 
quite other than party methods by the seminal 
method, rather; and more than one profound 
and far-reaching tendency in both the Anglican 
and Roman communions to-day testifies to the 



efficacy of his seed-sowing. " Paucorum 
num sum" he wrote, and if you choose your 
" few " with care, there is, in the long run, no 
better way. 

At last the tide of official favor turned. The 
cloud of neglect and misunderstanding was lifted. 
He passed, almost in an instant, from the posi- 
tion of " a nobody," as he sorrowfully said, to 
the rank of a prince of the Church. He had 
not sought high place, and no man ever consid- 
ered himself less competent to fill it. He had 
desired only to work, to be useful, and he had 
been "laid aside," apparently "thrown away." 
And then, when he could work no more, he sud- 
denly found that what he had accomplished 
against baffling obstacles, though so much less 
than he wished, though as nothing in his eyes, 
was valued and honored by those whom, umK-r 
God, he most wished to please. He found, in- 
deed, that it was he that was honored and valued, 
that his life was his work, and that the Church to 
which it had been devoted accepted and crowned 
it. Little wonder that he exclaimed when he was 
informed of the cardinalate, " The cloud is lifted 
from me forever." The twelve years that re- 
mained to him were years of peace. Surrounded 
by the love and devotion of his sons of the Ora- 
tory, by the admiration and respect of his coun- 
trymen, by the veneration of the Catholic world, 
he lived out his appointed days. " The weight 
of years," he had written long before, " falls on 
me as snow, gently though surely." His bond 
with life was loosened link by link, while he 
watched the process with clear mind and peace- 
ful acquiescent heart. When he died, it seemed 
to many, as Mr. R. W. Hutton said, that "a 
white star was extinguished in their mental hori- 
He was not a saint. To an admirer who 



/on. 



desired to canonize him in his lifetime, he wrote : 
" Saints are not literary men, they do not love 
the classics, they do not write Tales. I may be 
well enough in my way, but it is not ' the high 
line.' " But if not a saint, he was a religious 
genius of the very highest order, of the race and 
lineage of Pascal. A large part of his charm 
and a very large part of his helpfulness, both 
personally and in his writings, lie in the fact 
j that all his life long he did what he once gently 
rebuked a friend for not doing : " with a reso- 
lute heart and with earnestness," he " fought 
the battle of his soul." It is for this reason 
that these words of the Abbe* Bremond, his 
most subtle and sympathetic critic, strike us as 
so profoundly adequate : 

" Artist of the first rank, the best part of his art con- 
sists in making palpable and transparent the realities of

the invisible world. Religious philosopher, all his doc- 
trine may be reduced to making the expectation, the 
desire, and the need of God the foundation of all apolo- 
getic and the very basis of the act of faith. Too much 
like men in general to be canonized, he nevertheless 
keeps and will keep the glory of being one of those men, 
rare and predestinate, who impose on everyone that 
approaches them the thought of God."

CLASSICS FOR THE MILLIONS.* 

We live in an age of marvels, and not the 
least of these is the easy accessibility of the 
world's best books to a large proportion of the 
world's population. Not only does the public 
library open wide its doors to all that care to 
enter, but every person not absolutely a pauper 
can at little expense acquire a library of his 
own, even if it be of only five-foot-shelf size or 
smaller. Of all the many modern publishing 
enterprises that have helped to make possible 
to everyone this ownership of a private library, 
the series of standard works bearing the imprint 
of J. M. Dent & Sons in London, and of E. P. 
Dutton & Co. in New York, and known as 
" Everyman's Library," deserves mention among 
the foremost, if not as the very foremost. Be- 
gun a few years ago under the able editorship 
of Mr. Ernest Rhys, and with the design of cov- 
ering so wide a field that not fewer than a thou- 
sand volumes would be required to complete the 
set, this splendid (but remarkably inexpensive) 
library already numbers nearly six hundred 
volumes, and is rapidly increasing. A few 
passages from the publishers' preface to their 
descriptive list will best explain the purpose and 
scope of the undertaking. 

" It has not expected him [the reader] to be a serious 
student only, and it has given with a free hand the lighter 
reading he has asked for. But it has tried to make 
even the novel, whose claim hangs on its story, the pilot 
to literature at large; and it has stretched the English 
stage to touch that of Athens, and set JSschylus by 
Shakespeare. Among the achievements it counts, which 
have brought the hitherto unattainable big things to 
book, may be noted its eight volumes of Hakluyt's 
Travels, the Koran in Rodwell's fine version, its reprint 
of Rawlinson's Herodotus, its new edition of Sir Francis 
Galton's invaluable "An Enquiry into Human Faculty," 
and its translations of Balzac's novels. Other works 
which have required special enterprise are Grote's 
Greece (in twelve volumes), Finlay's histories, and the 
invaluable set of Ruskin's works with the careful artis- 
tic reproductions of the original plates. . . . 

" At an earlier stage we pointed out some of the diffi- 
culties of the whole vast scheme, and showed it would

be quite impossible to achieve it unless the public be- 
came as it were a working partner in it with the pub- 
lishers. Since then signs of the personal interest taken 
in it by people all the world over have reached the pub- 
lishers daily. . . . 

" The Fiction section is large in proportion; but your 
novel is the best of all inductors to other and graver 
works. Besides, who can vouch that he has learnt as 
much of London from any history-book as from the gay, 
grave, witty, and poignant pages of Charles Dickens?" 

Among those who have given generously of 
their time and scholarship toward the perfecting 
of this series, may be noted, in the list of later 
volumes alone, the names of Professor Saints- 
bury, who furnishes introductions to Fielding's 
" Joseph Andrews " and " Lives of the Nov- 
elists"; Dr. Charles W. Eliot, who prefaces 
Herbert Spencer's " Essays on Education and 
Kindred Subjects "; Professor Trent of Co- 
lumbia, who introduces Byron to the reader ; 
Professor Schelling of the University of Penn- 
sylvania, who does the same for Ben Jonson ; 
Professor George P. Baker of Harvard, who 
renders a like service to lovers of Beaumont 
and Fletcher ; Sir Oliver Lodge, who invites 
students of science to the perusal of Huxley's 
lectures and essays ; Mr. Lewis Melville, 
Sir W. Eobertson Nicoll, Mr. Theodore Watts- 
Dunton, Mr. Austin Dobson, and many more of 
equal repute. And now, to whet the appetite 
to a still keener edge for this rich and varied 
banquet, let us quote at random from the 
Introduction to the first volume that comes to 
hand. Here is our amiable old Pepys's incom- 
parable " Diary," in two compact but legibly 
printed parts, and prefaced by Dr. Richard 
Garnett, with a publishers' note to show that 
this is the fourth reprinting of the work in this 
edition. Of those two perennially diverting 
betrayers of their own weaknesses, Pepys and 
Boswell, Dr. Garnett takes occasion to say : 

" Their special distinction consists in this, that here, 
and here only, men whose considerable intellectual en- 
dowments included a lively perception of the humorous, 
lose all sense of humour when their own deportment is 
m question, and continually represent themselves in an 
absurd light, with an unconsciousness more diverting 
than the most sparkling wit or the most refined satire. 
The capital humour of the situation lies in the circum- 
stance that the men who thus give themselves away are 
by no means fools, and are keen to remark anything 
absurd in the behaviour of others. . . . The marvel in 
Pepys's case is not lessened by the fact that he certainly 
did not intend or expect his Diary to be read. A man 
of sense, and Pepys was a man of great good sense, 
would never even in that case have knowingly exhibited 
himself in a series of ludicrous positions. He is evidently 
quite unconscious that there is anything laughable in his 
behaviour when he accepts a bribe without looking at 
it, ' that I might say that I did not know what there was 
in the bag'; or when, finding the venison which his

patron has sent him to be tainted, he forthwith despatches 
it to his mother. Thousands of men would have done 
the like, no one but Pepys would have written it down." 

Among the more noteworthy issues of this 
Library if comparisons are admissible where 
such uniform high excellence prevails it is 
natural to point out, in this Dickens centennial 
year, the editions of his novels prefaced (with a 
single exception) by that inveterate Dickensian, 
Mr. G. K. Chesterton. Let us here snatch at 
least a fragment from his highly characteristic 
foreword to " Nicholas Nickleby." His writings 
may not be gospel to us, but they have a way 
of arresting the attention. 

" All romance consists of three characters. Other 
characters may be introduced; but those other characters 
are certainly mere scenery as far as the romance is con- 
cerned. They are bushes that wave rather excitedly; 
they are posts that stand up with a certain pride; they 
are correctly painted rocks that frown very correctly; 
but they are all landscape they are all a background. 
In every pure romance there are three living and mov- 
ing characters. For the sake of argument they may be 
called St. George and the Dragon and the Princess. In 
every romance there must be the twin elements of loving 
and fighting. In every romance there must be the three 
characters : there must be the Princess, who is a thing to 
be loved; there must be the Dragon, who is a thing to be 
fought; and there must be St. George, who is a thing that 
both loves and fights. There have been many symptoms 
of cynicism and decay in our modern civilization; there 
have been many indications of an idle morality cutting 
up life to please itself, and an idle philosophy doubting 
first whether truth is accepted and then doubting whether 
it is truth at all. But of all the signs of modern feeble- 
ness, of lack of grasp on morals as they actually must be, 
there has been none quite so silly or so dangerous as this : 
that the philosophers of to-day have started to divide lov- 
ing from fighting and to put them into opposite camps." 

The high character of the Library and of its 
editorship being thus sufficiently established, it 
may be interesting to note that of the first five 
hundred volumes published the number in each 
different class of literature is as follows (we 
quote from the publishers' statistical statement) : 
" Biography, 35 ; classical, 21 ; essays and belles- 
lettres, 62; fiction, 155; history, 56; oratory, 
5; poetry and drama, 39; reference books, 4; 
romance, 15; science, 10; theology and philo- 
sophy, 28; travel and topography, 26; young 
people's books, 44." In the cloth binding the 
volumes are also bound in flexible leather dif- 
ferent colors and shades are used to distinguish 
the different classes of literature. For example, 
fiction glows in a warm crimson ; history clothes 
itself in scarlet, perhaps thus symbolizing the 
bloody battle-fields that inevitably stain its 
pages; poetry and drama appear in olive green ; 
the oriental classics in dark blue ; biography in 
lavender; and reference books in maroon. The 
binding, print, and paper are all that could be 



asked for in such a series. Where the length 
of a work is considerable, very thin l>ut opaque 
paper has been used. "Nicholas Nickleby " i> 
thus compivss.-d within tin- limits of a volume 
less than an inch thick, but having nearly nine 
hundred clearly-printed pages. How so much of 
worth for so small a price is made, or is hoped 
to be made, a commercial possibility, will appear 
from the following further quotation from the 
publishers' explanatory foreword: 

To close this preamble, we can hardly do better than 
repeat, with no loss of emphasis, what we said two years 
ago of our ambition, and our difficulties in bringing it 
liberally to its aim. The grand idea of Everyman's 
Library, then, is to offer to Everyman, to every Knglish 
reader in any country, the choice of every great author 
that exists, who can be brought into the literature in a 
compact and comely form. But this is a vast undertak- 
ing; and it can be accomplished only if the public in 
England, America, the Colonies, and elsewhere learn to 
look upon it at their own affair, and cooperate with the edi- 
tors and publishers stage by stage. If the publishers can 
depend on their audience in this way, then Everyman's 
Library will continue to keep an open house, where (as 
Philemon Holland says, paraphrasing Plutarch) 'there 
is a Grace and Muse met together that is to say de- 
light conjoined with some knowledge and learning.' " 

A word of hearty commendation is due to 
the expertly compiled " Dictionary Catalogue of 
the First 505 Volumes of Everyman's Library," 
which is issued in uniform style with the series 
itself. Miss Isabella M. Cooper and Miss 
Margaret A. McVety, librarians of experience in 
cataloguing, are chiefly responsible for this well- 
annotated and cross-referenced list. No marks 
of classification, Dewey or other, have been set 
opposite the titles ; but there is space enough 
to fill them in if it be desired to use this printed 
catalogue for working purposes in either public 
or private library. The only regret is that it 
will need revision and enlargement as succeed- 
ing volumes in the second half of the series are 
published. PERCY F. BICKNELL. 



THE POETRY OF INSECT LIFE.* 



" Do you know this Halicti ? Perhaps not. There is 
no great harm done: it is quite possible to enjoy the few 
pleasures of life without knowing the Italic ti. N 
theless, when questioned with persistence, those humble 
creatures with no history can tell us some very singular 
things; and their acquaintance is not to be disdained if 
we desire to enlarge our ideas a little upon the bewilder- 
ing rabble of this world. Since we have nothing better 
to do, let us look into these Halicti." 

Thus does Fabre introduce us to the burrowing 
bees, which are as common in this country as 

THE LIFE AND LOVE or THE INSECT. By J. Henri 
Fabre. Translated by Alexander Teixeira de Mattos. New 
York: The Macmillan Co.

in his own South of France. Anyone may know 
the Halicti, with pleasure and advantage ; yet as 
a matter of fact there are probably not a dozen 
people in America who have made their acquaint- 
ance, in the intimate Fabrian sense. There is 
a certain absurdity in reviewing the writings of 
Fabre at this late date. The " Souvenirs Ento- 
mologiques " are classical, and have been quoted 
in every work on general entomology or psy- 
chology for many years past. Nevertheless, as 
Maeterlinck justly wrote, " the crowd is almost 
ignorant of the name of J. H. Fabre, who is one 
of the most profound and inventive scholars and 
also one of the purest writers, and, I was going 
to add, one of the finest poets, of the century 
that is just past." Scientific writings may be 
divided into three groups : technical works in- 
tended for scientific men, popular compilations 
for general use, and works which contribute to 
literature and science at the same time. Of the 
first two there is no lack, but our third division 
is so poorly represented as to have led to the say- 
ing that those who can write on scientific subjects 
have no original ideas, while those who have ideas 
cannot write. It is even true that popular works 
by eminent investigators are usually to be de- 
scribed as critical compilations, taking no high 
rank as science or literature. Nothing of this 
sort could be said of Fabre, who errs, if at all, 
on the side of excessive originality. The Fab- 
rian doctrine in science is like that of Auguste 
Sabatier in religion : away from authority, away 
from institutionalism, toward the source of light 
itself, approached naively and with confidence. 
Entomology, with Fabre, is a matter strictly 
between the observer and the insect. In one of 
his chapters, after describing how he was misled 
by placing reliance on what he had read, he gives 
an account of a visit from Pasteur, in illustration 
of his point. 

" Pasteur's tour through the Avignon region had seri- 
culture for its object. For some years, the silk-worm 
nurseries had been in confusion, ravaged by unknown 
plagues. The worms, for no appreciable reason, were 
falling into a putrid deliquescence, [or] hardening, so to 
speak, into plaster sugar-plums. The downcast peasant 
saw one of his chief crops disappearing; after much care 
and trouble, he had to fling his nurseries on the dung- 
heap. 

" A few words were exchanged on the prevailing 
blight; and then, without further preamble, my visitor 
said: 'I should like to see some cocoons. I have never 
seen any; I know them only by name. Could you get 
me some ? ' 

" ' Nothing easier. My landlord happens to sell co- 
coons, and he lives in the next house. If you will wait 
a moment, I will bring you what you want.' 

" Four steps took me to my neighbour's, where I 
crammed my pockets with cocoons. I came back and 



handed them to the savant. He took one, turned and 
turned it between his fingers; he examined it curiously, 
as one would a strange object from the other end of the 
world. He put it to his ear and shook it: "Why, it 
makes a noise! ' he said, quite surprised. 

" ' There 's something inside! ' 

" ' Of course there is.' 

" < What is it ? ' 

" The chrysalis.' 

" ' How do you mean, the chrysalis? ' 

" ' I mean the sort of mummy into which the cater- 
piller changes before becoming a moth.' 

" ' And has every cocoon one of those things inside it ?' 

" ' Obviously. It is to protect the chrysalis that the 
caterpiller spins.' 

"'Really!' 

" And, without more words, the cocoons passed into 
the pocket of the savant, who was to instruct himself 
at his leisure touching that great novelty, the chrysalis. 
I was struck by this magnificent assurance. Pasteur 
had come to regenerate the silk-worm, while knowing 
nothing about caterpillars, cocoons, chrysalises or meta- 
morphoses. The ancient gymnasts came naked to the 
fight. The talented combatant of the plague of our silk- 
worm nurseries hastened to the battle likewise naked, 
that is to say, destitute of the slightest notions about 
the insect which he was to deliver from danger. . . . 
This novice, whose artless questions surprised me so 
greatly, is about to revolutionize the hygiene of the silk- 
worm nurseries. In the same way, he will revolutionize 
medicine and general hygiene." 

This amusing description requires a little 
explanation. Little as Pasteur may have known 
of entomology, he did know about bacteria, and 
was a learned chemist. Of Fabre himself it is 
equally true that he approached his problems 
with a mind well stored with knowledge and 
trained in judgment. These advantages, com- 
bined with a high degree of native ability, 
produced the results we so much admire. Nev- 
ertheless, it was equally true of Pasteur and 
Fabre, that they sought direct contact with na- 
ture, and it was certainly due to their freedom 
from the shackles of tradition that they made 
many of their important discoveries. One re- 
members how Pasteur was solemnly assured by 
the best authorities that it was useless to attack 
the question of spontaneous generation, and how 
even Darwin used to surprise his friends by start- 
ing all sorts of apparently crazy experiments. 

The impression one has, on reading Fabre's 
charming essays, is that since the materials are 
everywhere abundant, one has only to go out- 
of-doors and watch, to see things as he saw 
them. This is not precisely the truth, and yet 
it is possible to learn. Beginning with insects 
of the same kinds as those studied by Fabre, 
one may first substantially repeat his observa- 
tions, and when more experienced, go on to 
others never yet observed. There is indeed an 
excellent field for original work in every part

of this country, and perhaps when the oppor- 
tunities are better understood there will be 
more workers. There are, however, difficulties 
other than intellectual. The work consumes a 
great deal of time, and is often physically ex- 
hausting. Dr. and Mrs. Peckham of Milwaukee, 
who better than any others represent Fabre in 
America, thus write of their experiences when 
watching wasps : 

" For a whole week of scorching summer weather 
we lived in the bean patch, scorning fatigue. We 
quoted to each other the example of Fabre's daughter 
Claire, whose determination to solve the problem of 
Odynenu led to a sun-stroke. We followed scores of 
wasps as they hunted ; we ran, we threw ourselves upon 
the ground, we scrambled along on our hands and knees 
in our desperate endeavors to keep them in view, and 
yet they escaped us. After we had kept one in sight 
for an hour or more some sudden flight would carry 
her far away and all our labor was lost." 

This is quoted from "The Instincts and Habits 
of the Solitary Wasps," a book which will de- 
light all those who care for the works of Fabre. 
No doubt it is for the younger generation, 
some of whom may have more leisure for intel- 
lectual pursuits than their parents, that the mes- 
sage of Fabre is chiefly of value. We would 
suggest to those who have children of high school 
age, that a copy of the work now reviewed might 
in many cases be an acceptable present. The 
work is of course only a translation of a selection 
from the "Souvenirs." The translation is a 
good one in some respects, pleasant to read and 
retaining much of the lively style of the French ; 
but it greatly needs revising in detail. It is to 
be hoped that before long a new edition will be 
called for, and that it will be thoroughly gone 
over by an expert before publication.

PROBLEMS OF HUMANITY AND PROPERTY.* 

That the labor problem is a serious one in 
the United States, as well as in England and 
France, is a fact which students of public affairs 
must admit. That it cannot be understood with- 
out a knowledge of certain underlying forces is 
another fact equally patent, and one which is a 
sufficient justification of the ever-increasing 
amount of literature dealing with the subject. 
The student of history cannot help recalling the 
mass of literature which deluged France before 
the Revolution, and wondering if the present 
flood will help us to a saner solution than was 
the immediate result in that country. At least 

THE HIHTORY AXD PROBLEMS or ORGANIZED LABOR. 
By Frank Tracy Carlton, Ph.D. Boston : D. C. Hath A Co. 



it .an be said that much of the present litera- 
ture is sane. To this class belongs Professor 
Carlton's book, " The History and Problems 
of Organ ized Labor." 

But while the book is sane, it is not exactly 
what one would expect from the title. The 
history of the conditions which drove labor 
almost to desperation, and of the fierce struggles 
through which it has passed, has been reduced to 
the minimum ; the purpose of the author being 
to state the present problems of labor with the 
barest necessities of historical background. The 
problems are various, beginning with the forms 
of government and the determination of policies 
of the labor unions. The various coercive meas- 
ures used by laborers and employers to attain 
their ends, the methods of remuneration, includ- 
ing the different kinds of wages, profit-sharing 
and cooperation, the means of settling disputes, 
and protective legislation, are all described at 
length. A chapter is devoted to immigration, be- 
cause of its influence on the labor situation. The 
" sweated " industries receive due attention ; as 
do also the problems of child, woman, and prison 
labor, unemployment, and industrial education. 

A striking characteristic of the book is its 
balance. It is neither a tirade against capital 
nor a special plea for labor. Apparently the 
author has attempted to state the facts from a 
disinterested point of view. The facts are so 
overwhelming, that he, with every open-minded 
man, inevitably leans to one side the side on 
which are found life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness. But it is not the liberty of a century 
ago, the laissezfaire kind. We have changed 
all that, yes, since fifty, even twenty years ago. 

Sixty years ago, Herbert Spencer declared 
that every attempt to alleviate the suffering of 
the poor through state intervention only resulted 
in its exacerbation. Speaking of education, he 
said : " Taking away a man's property to educate 
his own or other people's children is not needful 
for the maintenance of his rights, and hence is 
wrong." He further declared that no rights of 
children were violated by a failure to educate 
them. Even if their rights were violated by this 
neglect, the presumption is that Spencer would 
say that it was violating another and greater 
right to tax a man for their education. He even 
said that it was a " violation of the moral law " 
for the State " to interpose between quacks and 
those who patronize them," and that it was an 
inalienable right of the individual to "buy in-li- 
cine and advice from whomsoever he pleases." 

Such was the despairing effort of a ninrtccntli- 
century philosopher of the laissez faire school 



1912.] 



THE DIAL

to bolster up the claims of the privileged classes 
under the guise of liberty and rights. If anyone 
should object that such was not his object, it is 
enough to say that social conditions in England 
were such at that time that any careful observer 
ought to have been able to see that the carrying 
out of such teaching would have that result. The 
twentieth-century man is no less jealous of liberty 
and rights; but it is a far cry from Spencer to 
the present-day conception of what constitutes 
liberty and rights. In Spencer's day, the world 
had pretty generally accepted the principle of 
the freedom of thought, and was beginning to 
ask, What is that freedom worth if a man is left 
so ignorant that he cannot think ? Then it was 
decided that children had a right to demand of 
the State an opportunity to make this freedom 
real, that is, an opportunity for an education 
at public expense ; to-day we have gone beyond 
that and decided that the State has the right to 
demand that the child shall be educated at its 
expense for the welfare of the social whole. 

Thus slowly and painfully do we change our 
conceptions of the content of real liberty. The 
laissez faire philosophy took a strong hold on 
the imaginations of men, and it is hard for us 
to get rid of the notion that liberty and equality 
depend on a "hands-off " policy on the part of 
the State. This policy worked at least moder- 
ately well in this country in the earlier part of 
the nineteenth century, when land was plentiful 
and a laborer really had an opportunity to work 
for himself when he became dissatisfied with his 
employer. But to-day the liberty to quit his job 
if he does not like the conditions or his wages 
means little less than the liberty to starve. So- 
ciety, says Professor Carlton, " is slowly coming 
to the realization of the fact that equality of 
treatment of unequals often results in gross in- 
justice." 

If society is slowly coming to this decision, the 
courts are coming to it somewhat more slowly. 
Only sixteen years ago the Supreme Court of 
Illinois declared void an eight-hour law for 
women, on the ground that it was the policy of 
the State to advance the cause of women, where- 
as this law would relegate her " back to depen- 
dence." Most courts declined to follow Illinois 
in this treatment of women and children, hold- 
ing that children were the wards of the State, 
and that some favorable legislation was neces- 
sary in the case of women to put them, in the 
words of Justice Holmes, " on terms of equality 
with the more powerful party." Yet as late as 
1907 the New York Court of Appeals declared 
void a law prohibiting night-work by women 



wage-earners, on the ground that it was an un- 
warranted interference with the freedom of con- 
tract. But be it said to the honor of Illinois, 
that in 1910 her courts sustained a ten-hour law 
for women. 

But if woman and child workers have made 
gains, male workers still have much for which 
to fight. There is as yet no recognition of the 
fact that inequalities exist as between man and 
man, as well as between men and women ; and 
that a weak man may need some protective legis- 
lation " to put him on terms of equality with the 
more powerful party." Neither do the courts, 
says Professor Carlton, "assume the same atti- 
tude toward an attempt of organized labor to 
obtain an eight-hour day that they do toward an 
attempt on the part of aggregate capital a cor- 
poration to acquire property . The right to daily 
leisure is not legally safeguarded as securely as 
the right to acquire and hold property." To- 
day the Pittsburg landlord spends his leisure 
which is all his time in Europe, and collects 
his rents through an agent from workers in the 
mills who are given enough leisure out of twelve 
hours of toil seven days in the week to pay this 
tribute. Some day, perhaps, we shall set hu- 
manity above property. y< 



THE TRUTH ABOUT NIETZSCHE.* 

Friedrich Nietzsche's life was lived in a series of 
decades. Born October 15, 1844, on the forty-ninth 
anniversary of the birth of the " Romanticist on the 
Throne," Friedrich Wilhelm IV., after whom he 
was named, Nietzsche was for ten years (185868) 
a student at Pforta, Bonn, and Leipzig; for ten 
years (1869-79) Professor of Classical Philology at 
Basel ; for ten years (1879-89) an almost incred- 
ibly prolific writer ; and for ten years (18891900) 
a man without a mind. He enjoyed just twenty 
years of mature productive activity. During the 
first half of this period he had to attend to the 
various academic duties that devolve upon a very 
young professor ; throughout the greater part of the

entire period he suffered the tortures of the damned 
from his head and his eyes and his stomach. Yet 
hU works, so far as they have been published in ( Jer- 
many, consist of seventeen volumes aggregating over 
8500 pages of solid if repetitive material. And there 
is more to come. Small wonder, then, that George 
Brandes, in one of the very first trustworthy essays 
on Nietzsche (1888), should have said in his just 
and divinatory way: "Of modern German writers, 
Nietzsche is to me the most interesting. He deserves 
to be studied, interpreted, refuted, and assimilated." 

Nietzsche was a philologist (1869-76 ), a philoso- 
pher(1876-83),aprophet(1883-89),apsycholojjist 
at times, and always a poet. He abounded in afflic- 
tion, aspiration, courtesy, family pride, fortitude, 
individualism, intelligence, lyricism, melancholy, 
paradoxes, and receptivity. He lacked balance, com- 
mon sense, humor, modesty, originality, patriotism, 
and sympathy. He liked aphorisms,chloral, Dionysos, 
Greece, big-sounding words, music, solitude, strength, 
the Old Testament, and war. He disliked alchohol, 
anarchism, anti-Semitism, Apollo, constraint, Chris- 
tianity, the crowd, history, Prussia, romanticism, 
socialism, specialists, the New Testament, tobacco, 
and women. That is to say, it seems as though he 
did. But to take only one case, Nietzsche possessed 
such a huge amount of common sense that we are 
apt to be prejudiced as to the quality in the face of 
such an overwhelming quantity. 

More so than in the case of Prince Paul Troubet- 
zkoy, Nietzsche's works constitute his life. He 
thought much, he read little, he acted less. Nor do 
the few conspicuous features of his life add mate- 
rially to an explanation of his works. He came of 
a long line of long-lived Protestant preachers. He 
never spoke a word until he was two and a half years 
old, and his first spoken word was "grandma." He 
blushed, as a child, when he broke anything and 
then spent his adult years trying to break things. 
He heard, as a mere boy, Handel's " Messiah," and 
went straight home and began to compose another 
Messiah." If he found a girl apparently as clever 
as a boy, he attributed the equality to some supernat- 
ural power and this before reading Schopenhauer. 
He wrote out a complete invoice of his life every 
time he took a decisive step. He matriculated at the 
University of Leipzig, October 18, 1865, just one 
century after Goethe's matriculation at the same 
institution, and laughed in his sleeve when Rector 
Kahnis advised the fellows not to follow Goethe's 
example as a student. He sat through many lectures, 
took almost no notes, and became a very wise man. 
Leipzig gave him a doctor's degree, when he was 
twenty-four years old, without dissertation or exami- 
nation. Since he spent the major part of his life writ- 
ing dissertations, one can pardon this feature of his 
unique degree, but he should have been obliged to 
pass the examinations, for he just barely passed those 
at Pforta. He was a Professor of Philology who 
advised his students not to become philologists. He 
himself did some glaringly inaccurate etymologizing. 
He is the author of more puns than any man who 



ever wrote the German language. Sensitive himself 
as an anemone, he felt it his mission to despise the 
weak, crush the mediocre, and refute the strong. All 
of which is more interesting than explanatory. 

Although Nietzsche had but one contemporary 
disciple, Heinrich Koselitz, he has been followed 
up by legions of posthumous ones. Mr. M. A. 
Mllgge makes the statement in his life of Nietzsche 
(1908) that there have been nearly one fourth as 
many monographs written on him as on Shake- 
speare. The same writer points out the influence 
of Nietzsche on Albert!, Andrejanoff, Bleibtreu, 
Conrad, Conradi, Dehmel, Ernst, Fulda, Halbe, 
Hart, Hauptmann, Heyse, Jordan, Kappf-Essenther, 
Kretzer, von Leixner, von Mayer, Mauthner, Ros- 
mer, Spiel hagen, Sudermann, Schlaf, Weigand, Wid- 
mann, and Wilbrandt, in Germany, as well as a 
space-consuming list of writers in England, France, 
Spain, Italy, and Russia. But we are concerned 
here with Nietzschean students. What has been 
their attitude toward their hero? Those who have 
studied him but little, or not at all, condemn his 
works on the ground that he was revolutionary, and 
cynical, and contradictory, and insane. Those who 
have studied him most, and who knew him longest 
and best, deny the charge of insanity previous to 
January 4, 1889, and look upon the other unenvi- 
able characteristics as being as irrelevant to a discus- 
sion of his works as would Da Vinci's hobnobbing 
with Caesar Borgia be to an appreciation of his 
" La Gioconda." Lessing said once, that in order to 
understand any single sentence of Aristotle, it was 
necessary to read all of Aristotle. It is just so with 
Nietzsche. And to the student who has read all of 
Nietzsche, the case presents itself about as follows : 
We have to do here with a man of imaginative intel- 
lectuality, who believed in the will to power, the 
eternal return of the same, the relativity of all things, 
and that the existence of the world is justified only 
as an aesthetic phenomenon. Equip a man with such 
faith, and then let him always be thinking, and poeti/.- 
ing, and writing while awake, and so arrange his 
health that he has to take chloral in order to sleep, 
and we get those seventeen volumes that provoked 
the seven studies with which we have to deal in this 
review. 

Mr. Orage's booklet on Nietzsche is just half as 
long as the Constitution of the United States. In 
the very first sentence, he refers to his hero as "the 
greatest European event since Goethe," thus ruling 
out of court Victor Hugo, whom Nietzsche dubbed 
" the light-house on the sea of nonsense." A little 
later, Nietzsche is referred to as "the brightest intel- 
lectual light that Europe knew." So this is no unin- 
spired study. And yet, what Mr. Orage has actually 
done is this: After giving the few facts of Nietzsche's 
life in the first chapter, he has analyzed his first work, 
"The Birth of Tragedy," in which Nietzsche set up 
the famous doctrine of Apollo against Dionysos. 
Nietzsche always claimed that he was the first to 
formulate this principle. Yet Friedrich Schlegel did 
it before him, in so many words, and Schiller did 



1912.] 



THE DIAL, 



319 



it before him, in other words, in Die Wiirde der 
Frauen, which poem might have been entitled Die 
Unwilrde der Manner. This is the doctrine: Just 
as procreation is dependent on the duality of the 
sexes, so is the continuous development of art bound 
up with the duplexity of the Apollonian and the 
Dionysian. Apollo is the good and manly god of 
shape, restraint, boundaries of justice, light, sweet 
reasonableness, individualization, beauty, the harp, 
the epic, the god of Homer, of sooth-saying, and of 
dreams. Dionysos is the bad god of formlessness, 
lack of restraint, loss of the individual, the dithyram- 
bic god of romanticism, of the tragedy, of Archilochus, 
of drunkenness, and of music. Mr. Orage has, to be 
sure, a chapter on " Beyond Good and Evil," and one 
on "The Superman," but they do not get far beyond 
Nietzsche's first work. The most interesting page 
in the whole treatise is the one containing the list of 
dead and living Dionysian writers, of the former, 
twenty-four, of the latter, eight, as follows : Brandes, 
Bernard Shaw, W. H. Hudson, R. B. Cunninghame 
Graham, Gorki, H. G. Wells, Edward Carpenter, 
and W. B. Yeats. Of the former list, Blake is pos- 
sibly the most interesting, since Mr. Orage says 
elsewhere that "he who has read the Marriage of 
Heaven and Hell, and grasped its significance, will 
have little to learn from the apostle of Zarathustra" 

Mr. Paul Elmer More began his study of Nietzsche 
"with a feeling of repulsion for the man," and laid 
it down with "pity for his tragic failures and admira- 
tion for his reckless devotion to ideas " another 
case of tout comprendre, c'est tout pardonner, si 
non tout admirer. He attempts to define Nietzsche's 
attitude toward sympathy and egotism. The book 
is very small, the point of view very comprehensive. 
Beginning with the pure egotism of the seventeenth 
century moralists, as preached by Hobbes and La 
Rochefoucauld, we pass on to the faintly sympathetic 
naturalism of Locke and Mandeville, then to Hume 
who made a more or less altruistic naturalism cur- 
rent, and Adam Smith who gave it sentiment, next 
we hear of Laurence Sterne and Henry Brooke who 
added the touch of sentimentality, which touch pre- 
pares us for Rousseau who taught that self-interest 
is sure to work injustice, and Schleiermacher, who 
preached the universal sympathy of German Roman- 
ticism all of which takes us two centuries away 
from Nietzsche, who admired La Rochefoucauld and 
anathematized "sympathy with the lowly and the 
suffering as a standard for the elevation of the soul." 
After this long but legitimate digression, Mr. More 
returns to Nietzsche the arch-egotist, the prophet 
who made some highly provocative remarks concern- 
ing his self-interested efforts to reach a superhuman 
goal. The work stimulates. Yet this book, like all 
of Nietzsche's own books, shows that he is a very 
wise man who can fly in the face of the relativity of 
all things and determine, with stop-watch accuracy, 
just where egotism ends and altruism begins, or 
the other way around. 

Miss Emily Hamblen made her study of Nietzsche 
for America. She believes, namely, that our ten- 



dencies are directly away from our enunciated ideals, 
and that Nietzsche's penetrating thought will there- 
fore help us to discover our actual minds hence 
the New Gospel. But with the best of intentions it 
cannot be said that hers is a new exegesis of Nietz- 
sche's old message unless it be the one chapter on 
style, where she points out that Nietzsche gave new 
meanings to such terms as "will," "free spirit," 
"sympathy," "logic," "reason," "knowledge," and 
"necessity." Webster and his whole fraternity walk 
on a bottomless quag in this chapter, hut life re- 
mains the same. To explain, for example, "neces- 
sity " biologically will neither lower the cost of 
provisions nor clarify our aspirations. The fact of 
the whole business is this: Nietzsche was an untir- 
ing attacker. In the seventh aphorism of " Why I 
am so wise," he tells us that he attacked only the 
triumphant, and that he did this alone, imperson- 
ally, and unreminiscentially. It is healthy to have 
a select number of this sort of men around. They 
nerve; but they do not found a new gospel. Evan- 
gels, like constitutions, need occasional amendments, 
but complete supplantation never! 

Of the seven studies considered in the present 
review, Mr. Ludovici's " Nietzsche and Art " is the 
most remarkable, partly because the writer ap- 
proaches Nietzsche from the aesthetic side. Despite 
the fact that Nietzsche was essentially a man of 
letters, and not a student of science (which he 
loathed as something that only produces ugliness), 
the book on "Nietzsche the Litterateur," though it is 
being cared for, has not yet been written. Nietzsche 
bore about the same relation to German letters that 
Emerson (whom he read and adored and imitated) 
hore to American letters. This, in substance, is Mr. 
Ludovici's thesis : The highest Art, or Ruler- Art, in 
which culture is opposed to chaos can be the product 
only of an aristocratic society. Nietzsche preached 
the highest type, the Superman. But with mob at 
the top and mob at the bottom, the multitude feel 
it their privilege, if not their duty, to smear and 
smatter in art, so we get mob and medley in art. 
If we had, however, such a faith in a worthy Ruler- 
Type as existed in the Egypt that produced the 
diorite statue of King Khephren, the huilder of the 
second pyramid of Gizeh, then art would be blessed 
with the symmetry that denotes balance, the sobriety 
that reveals restraint, the simplicity that proves the 
power of the mind, the transfiguration that betrays 
elation, the repetition that connotes obedience, and 
the variety that characterizes all hortatory art. The 
spirits of Winckelmann and Lessing and Goethe at 
their best are here conjured up. There are 236 
pages in the book, but he who does not read it 
straight through at once has either weak eyes or 
slight appreciation of edle Einfalt und stille Grosse. 
And he who reads it but once is artistically impious. 

It requires haloed patience to read Mr. J. M. Ken- 
nedy's book on "The Quintessence of Nietzsche." 
The English language has no subjunctive of indirect 
discourse. In this book, master and disciple speak 
on the same page. They speak in turns. And with

no change of type, and with only an almost imper- 
ceptible indentation of the line-, how is one to tell who 
is speaking? Also, one quotation will prove that tin- 
book is not only explanatory, but decidedly apolo- 
getic and justificatory . Nietzsche delivered in 18 7 L* a 
series of lectures on "The Future of our Educational 
Institutions." Of these Mr. Kennedy says: 

" If the lectures are applicable to both Germany and En- 
gland, they are even more applicable to the United State* of 
America, probably the most Philistine country in the world. 
This heterogeneous agglomeration of eighty million Philis- 
tines stand* badly in need of a Nietzsche at the present 
moment, and as the country is not likely to produce one 
its schools and colleges turn out mere standardised money- 
making machines we can only hope that these lectures will 
be thoroughly studied there by the few who have not been 
drawn into the commercial vortex." 

Though grieved at our deplorable condition, we smile, 
and hope, and worry on ! And this is not the only 
passage where Mr. Kennedy falls into similar tone. 
In the conclusion, we hear of "the malign influence 
of Christianity," of the " superiority of the Italian 
beggar-boy with the instinctive good taste in art to 
the American millionaire whose thoughts cannot 
raise themselves above the fluctuations of the Stock 
Exchange," and so on. It sounds like Nietzsche 
himself. It makes us stop and think. But now that 
the quintessence of Nietzsche has been given, we 
suddenly recall that Nietzsche did not have to stop 
to think, so that many of his thoughts are flighty and 
errant. And when Nietzsche did stop, he consumed 
his time writing down his thoughts instead of asso- 
ciating with his fellow-men ; as a result of which he 
said many commonplace things, not knowing that 
many others had also said them. 

Translations are contestable evidence of merit, 
done, as they sometimes are, more out of curiosity 
than admiration. Sudermann's worst work found a 
translator almost without delay ; Fontane's best re- 
mains untranslated. Mr. Ludovici has met a demand 
by his excellent rendering of " Ecce Homo," thus 
completing the seventeenth volume of Nietzsche in 
English. He and Helen Zimmern are among the 
best translators in the series. One can only admire 
the great faith with which he approached his task. 
!>. Homo" was begun by its author October 15, 
1888, and finished November 4 of the same year, 
though it was not published in Germany until 
1908. There are those who consider that during 
this period Nietzsche was an insane man. But Mr. 
Ludovici not only denies this, but he contends that 
his hero was then enjoying what the physicians call 
euphoria the state of highest well-being. He ad- 
mires the whole work of "Ecce Homo." Even such 
headings as, "Why I am so clever," he defends by 
Goethe's remark: Nur Lumpe find bescheiden. 
Whenever there is call for this sort of work, that is 
just the spirit in which it should be done. Yet it 
would have been a great boon to the German lan- 
guage had Nietzsche never been translated. " Ecce 
Homo" will be welcomed in English, however, 
especially for Nietzsche's account of "inspiration. ' 

But when we come to a discussion of M. Hale'vy 's 



Life of Nietzsche, we cheerfully overlook the many 
typographical errors in the quotations from the 
German, and the author's peculiar habit of referring 
to the exact day of the month without giving the 
year, and jubilantly proclaim the charm of the book 
as a whole. It gives a grand picture of the spiritual 
struggles of this last, lofty, German idealist. Mr. 
Kettle's introduction is also delightfully written. His 
reference to Nietzsche as " a man of ecstasies, rather 
than of sequent thought" is happy. Then there is 
an added charm by reason of the fact that Richard 
Wagner comes in for much discussion. Wagner is 
as conspicuous in these pages by his presence, as 
Nietzsche is by his absence in Wagner's Autobiog- 
raphy. The apparently unconscious purpose of Mr. 
Hale'vy has been to show that it was Wagner who 
deprived Nietzsche of those three things after which 
he so ardently strove friendship, love, and fame. 
And though Frau Cosima has never seen fit to allow 
the publication of the letters Nietzsche wrote to 
Wagner, Wagner's part of the correspondence has 
been published and is here wisely utilized. It is 
extremely doubtful if there has ever been such a 
peculiar friendship as existed between these two 
peculiar geniuses. Nietzsche is to be pitied. He 
thought (we are perplexed to know why) from the 
days of "Parsifal" and Bayreuth on that he hated 
Wagner. But M. Hale'vy makes it clear that the 
hatred, though not fictitious, was not unalloyed. 
Nietzsche loved, and therefore hated, the man who 
deprived him of friendship, love, and fame. One 
of the last coherent sentences he uttered in th<>-e 
last dark moments was, "Wagner, den hab' ich 
sehr geliebt! " And here we must unreservedly laud 
the fine taste with which the whole book is written, 
especially the part that deals with the mindless 
hero. German biographers have something to learn 
in this respect. M. Hale'vy passes over Nietzsche's 
last years with charity: he tells a few fascinating 
little stories, and then closes with the sentence, 
"Friedrich Nietzsche died at Weimar, on the ~~>th 
of August, 1900." 

So Nietzsche has been much discussed. He has 
passed through the whole gamut of comment, from 
ecstatic laudation to complete repudiation. No won- 
der! He wrote the very best of German prose 
though not always, as is currently believed, in short 
sentences. But he was a master of punctuation, of 
motionless gestures. His form was invariably good, 
his content infinitely varied. He had an opinion 
on every subject. Nothing to him was sacred ; 
everything was relative, liable to change, and eter- 
nally recurring. His case might be visualized as 
follows: He said more on the general topic of 
religion, in the broad sense, than on any other one 
theme. Now, let an intelligent college student go 
to his country home at Christmas. They have a 
Christmas service in the church of his childhood. 
They ask him to make an address. He accepts. He 
speaks on the beauty of celebrating Christ's hiitli. 
even as a mere tradition. In the course of his re- 
marks he says that the one thing we know about 



1912.]

Christ's birth is that it did not take place on the 
25th of December, so and so many years ago. His 
audience at once divides itself into four camps. 
There will be some who knew that fact long before 
this student was born. And a whole host of the ap- 
parently novel things that Nietzsche said were self- 
evident truths two thousand years ago. Others will 
be asleep, and will not hear. These Nietzsche 
would have liked to crush. But they deserve the 
sympathy that he condemned, they are tired, they 
have worked hard growing the wheat that Nietz- 
scheans eat. Others will say, " Ah, the city and the 
college have robbed him of his faith." But these 
deserve the patience that Nietzsche did not have.

RECENT FICTION.* 



The title of Mr. John Oxenham's "The High 
Adventure " is to be taken literally, for the tale is, 
in very truth, one of adventure in the " high" Alps. 
It tells of a young English diplomat who, on his vaca- 
tion in Switzerland, meets a damsel in distress, and 
becomes her protector. She is a Russian damsel, and 
she has a sister in a Swiss prison, incarcerated for 
her successful assassination of a high Russian official 
who had made her the object of his unwelcome atten- 
tions. Plans have been made for her escape, and to 
aid her in this attempt, the fair Sonia enlists Charles 
Verney, her accidental acquaintance. The attempt 
succeeds, whereupon the man and the two girls be- 
come fugitives from justice, and endeavor to reach 
the frontier undiscovered. In their wanderings, an 
avalanche overwhelms them, killing the sister (which 
is perhaps quite as well), and burying the other two 
in the mountain hut which is conveniently at hand 
when the snow slides down the mountain side. A 
pretty romance develops, and by the time the two 
are rescued, is ripe for the inevitable conclusion. 
This is not one of Mr. Oxenham's best stories, and

has many of the marks of the pot-boiler, but it is 
readable. A source of constant irritation is found 
in the fact that, whenever German words are intro- 
duced and this is quite frequently they are 
almost invariably misspelled. 

Once in a great while, the reviewer has the good 
fortune to come upon a novel which is not merely 
well-constructed and interesting, but whose every 
page exemplifies the artistic conscience of the writer. 
Such a novel is the " Christopher " of Mr. Richard 
Pryce. It is not a novel of heroics or of impossible 
idealities, and it is concerned only with ordinary 
people, but its characters are all authentic human 
beings, and their delineation gives evidence of the 
most painstaking and loving thought. The story of 
Christopher begins with his infancy. His widowed 
mother, returning from India, gives birth to him at 
sea, and his early years are spent in an English 
country home. Presently, the family circumstances 
become straitened, and the necessity for economy 
causes the family grandmother, mother, child, 
and devoted maid to take up their residence at 
Boulogne, and there Christopher lives through his 
boyhood years. He is distinctly a child who sees 
things, and early gives evidence of the possession of 
a sensitive artistic nature. One day he is in danger, 
and is rescued by an Englishman who henceforth 
becomes his hero and the pattern of all that seems 
admirable to his childish consciousness. Now this 
Englishman is a former sweetheart of Christopher's 
mother, and is just then in the train of a lady whose 
indiscretions (to put it mildly) have made her an 
outcast from English society, and the colony at 
Boulogne does not recognize her. All this is im- 
portant, because afterwards, when Christopher's 
family returns to England, the man, freed from his 
entanglement which had been the outcome of 
chivalry rather than of passion, succeeds in winning 
the love which had earlier been denied him, and 
becomes Christopher's step-father. Also, the lady 
with the shady past has a daughter who, after a 
chance encounter in England some years later, be- 
comes the object of Christopher's worship. The 
chapters that follow exhibit the psychology of a 
young man in love with marvellous penetration and 
sympathy, but the girl is not for him, as becomes 
evident when the inherited taint in her character is 
revealed. We take leave of Christopher as he is 
mastering the agony of disappointment, and seeking 
solace in his work. This is the whole story, a story 
for the most part of commonplace people, told in a 
way that is suggestive of Thackeray, with tender 
sentiment and rich appreciation of the values of 
ordinary human existence. It is a very beautiful 
and pathetic story, of the kind not to be hastily read 
without serious loss. 

A familar type of the Anglo-Indian novel is repro- 
duced in Mr. E. M. Dell's "The Way of an Eagle." 
First, there is the handful of British soldiers, sur- 
rounded by hostile natives in an isolated mountain 
post, too far from the main body to hope for succor, 
and maintaining a forlorn hope to the desperate

end. Then there is the daughter of the commanding 
officer, who must somehow be saved from a drea<iful 
fate. Then there is the daring soldier who loves IUT, 
and who charges himself with the responsibility of 
either rescuing her or of seeing that she is not taken 
alive. Being a resourceful man, Nick Ratcliffe carries 
her through the lines of the besiegers and brings her 
to safety in the advancing relief column. Gratitude 
would seem to dictate that Nick should have his 
reward, but Muriel Roscoe does not know her own 
mind, and a little malicious gossip, coupled with the 
feeling of horror with which she has witnessed the 
scene in which Nick had choked to death a native 
who was seeking her life, cause her to break off their 
engagement, and make it possible to prolong the story 
to the required length. Returning to England, she 
drifts into an engagement with the very Englishman 
whose nerve had failed him in the horrible crisis of 
her life in India, and who is now philandering with 
the wife of one of his friends in the Indian service. 
Nick puts the matter to both the man and the woman 
somewhat bluntly and breaks up this arrangement, 
whereupon Muriel gradually comes to the conclusion 
that she loves her rescuer after all. The fact that 
Nick's manner somehow suggests that of an eagle 
watching his prey and finally swooping down upon 
it is the explanation of the title given by Mr. Dell 
to his story. But we are not convinced that the 
heroine was worthy of the hero, despite all the au- 
thor's efforts to persuade us. 

" Bob Hardwick : The Story of his Life and Ex- 
periences," by Mr. Henry Howard Harper, is a book 
that comes to us in sumptuous guise, privately printed, 
and issued under the auspices of the Bibliophile Soci- 
ety. It is the story, told in the first person, of a boy's 
life from the age of five to the years of early manhood. 
The boy's father is a district school teacher, a wid- 
ower, who treats his child with unnatural harshness, 
although we occasionally get glimpses of a streak of 
sentiment somewhere in his composition. Early in 
the narrative, he breaks up his humble home, packs 
the meagre household equipment in a covered wagon, 
and starts upon a long odyssey, broken now and 
then by a school term, through the states lying west 
of the Mississippi. The boy gets a certain amount 
of schooling, by which he evidently profits, but most 
of his experiences relate to the periods during which 
he is hired out to various forms of service. About 
midway in the story, the father disappears from view, 
leaving his son in the clutches of an incredibly mean 
old farmer, who makes him do the work of two men 
for his board and clothes. Then comes a change in 
his fortunes, for it is discovered that he is the heir, 
through his mother, to a fair fortune. He then gives 
himself a real education, studies law, seeks out the 
girl whom he has held in secret adoration from the 
days when he was an unconsidered waif, and per- 
suades her to share his life. This is the outline of 
what we should take to be a literal transcript from 
the writer's memory of his own childhood experi- 
ences, were it not for the fact that the later chapters 
show some signs of contrivance. Still, boys do some- 



times inherit unsuspected fortunes, and do sometimes 
win the objects of their childish devotion, and there 
is no reason why we should not take the whole story to 
be a true one, as the larger part of it unquestionably 
i-. Its poignancy, its minute realism, and ita art- 
lessness, are things that we cannot ascribe wholly to 
imagination, and we have little doubt that the writer 
is, for the most part, copying from the book of his 
own life. This gives the book a documentary value 
which it could not well have if it were the product of 
artifice, and we get from it a vivid idea of the hard 
and prosaic conditions of frontier life a generation 
ago, as transmitted through the medium of a sensi- 
tive mind. Almost any commonplace person who has 
grown up under such conditions could tell as good a 
story as this, but it is only now and then that one 
is found who thinks the effort worth making. We 
have read the book from cover to cover with an inter- 
est aroused and sustained by its evident fidelity to 
fact, and it was only in those passages which led us 
to suspect an element of invention that our interest 
flagged. 

Mr. Meredith Nicholson has heretofore been 
known as a novelist of plot and incident, and, as 
such, has won many friends, and achieved a high 
position among our entertainers. But in " A Hoo- 
sier Chronicle " he has done something much bigger, 
and given us a work of fiction of a richly human 
sort, creating real characters rather than puppets, 
and giving us a penetrating study of political life and 
domestic relations in the commonwealth of Indiana. 
The period is that of the now dying generation, and 
we catch the ideals of the newer time in the very 
act of replacing the old ones. The story is aptly 
named, for it is a " chronicle " in the sense that it 
pursues a leisurely course, building up its interest by 
recording occurrences in their natural order, and 
revealing the Zeitgeist by many subtle suggestions. 
There is a plot, of course, but it is subordinated to 
the demands of the composition considered as a pic- 
ture, and is not accentuated by strikingly dramatic 
situations or climaxes. Even when the central mys- 
tery, that of the heroine's parentage, is cleared up, 
the disclosure is made quietly, and an opportunity 
which would be to most novelists the occasion for a 
startling denouement, with recrimination and self- 
reproach and tearful reparation, is handled with 
severe restraint. There is no surprise in the dis- 
closure, for we have been prepared for it all along, 
and it comes as the sequence of no dramatic trick, 
nor is it accompanied by any elaborate stage-setting. 
The appetite accustomed to literary condiments will 
find it all rather tasteless, but to the unspoiled pal- 
ate it will give wholesome satisfaction. The figure 
of Morton Bassett, about which the interest of the 
novel is centered, is a full-length portrait of the poli- 
tician who wins success by the means at hand, and 
is no more scrupulous in his methods than the pre- 
vailing standard of political morality seems to re- 
quire. But that standard is insensibly changing, 
and when the change is finally borne in upon his 
consciousness, he withdraws from the game. He is

THE DIAL 



by no means a bad man, but he realizes that his suc- 
cess has been due to practices that public opinion 
no longer regards with approval, and he heeds the 
lesson. This revulsion of feeling is largely brought 
about by the influence of his daughter Sylvia, who, 
by a series of seemingly trifling and unrelated reve- 
lations, learns of her parentage, and makes use of the 
knowledge, not to exact any personal reparation, but 
to persuade Bassett to make the atonement to society 
which his aroused conscience dictates. Something 
like a dozen important characters are involved in 
the action of the story, and every one of them is 
naturally and convincingly drawn. In such sober 
and conscientious workmanship we may find a real 
hope for the future of American literature. 

A remarkable study of the artistic temperament 
is given us in the " Tante " of Anne Douglas Sedg- 
wick (Mrs. Basil de Selincourt). Madame Okraska, 
in whom several racial strains are blended, is a 
pianist of world-wide fame, who is called Tante (in 
German pronunciation) by her intimates. She is a 
woman of genius, and, as is too frequently the case 
with such persons, finds in that fact a sufficient war- 
rant for despising ordinary mortals, and for treat- 
ing with scant courtesy those who, in simple kindness 
of heart, bestow upon her their attentions, and seek 
to knit with her those sympathetic human relations 
which sweeten life. She lives in such an atmo- 
sphere of adulation that it becomes a necessity of 
her existence, and whoever fails to do her instant 
and unmeasured homage, and patiently submit to 
being snubbed by her if caprice so prompts her, 
incurs her deepest displeasure. She is, moreover, 
intensely passionate, and becomes positively malig- 
nant if her whims are opposed. She has an inmost 
nature which is simply devilish, and yet, such is the 
spell cast by her genius upon her entourage, that 
her character is not suspected by her circle of ad- 
mirers. Particularly is she the object of the devotion 
of a young girl whom she has adopted in childhood, 
and who is her constant companion. Presently there 
appears upon the scene a well-bred young English- 
man of the philistine type, who falls in love with 
the young girl. He has wealth, position, and all the 
solid virtues imaginable, but he refuses to bow down 
to Madame Okraska's genius, and finds intolerable 
her associations and her manner of life. This does 
not become fully apparent until after the marriage, 
and when it does, the wife is distressed beyond meas- 
ure to know that her husband does not adore the 
woman who has hitherto been everything to her. 
Skilfully working upon the girl's emotions, Madame 
Okraska subtly seeks to wreck the menage, and in 
consequence, Karen deserts Gregory, and seeks ref- 
uge with her beloved guardian. Unfortunately, the 
moment is ill-chosen, for just then Madame Okraska 
is at her country home in Wales, philandering with 
a decadent poet whom she has taken up, and Karen's 
unexpected appearance interrupts the idyl. When 
the poet is discovered making love to Karen, there 
is a scene indeed, for the mask is thrown off, and 
the woman, in a fury of passion, reveals her real 



nature. Karen again takes flight, anywhere, to bury 
herself with the grief of her shattered ideal, and 
when Gregory unearths her, she realizes that he has 
been right all along. Even then, the desperate woman, 
by simulated contrition, tries to regain Karen's affec- 
tion, and to keep her apart from her husband, but 
her power for evil is broken forever. This makes 
a rather disagreeable story, which is saved by its 
style and its extraordinary powers of characteriza- 
tion. All three of the principal figures are made 
very real, as well as that of the old American woman 
who has been Madame Okraska's companion and 
caretaker from infancy, and who knows her through 
and through. When this shrewd New Englander, 
with her blunt homely speech and her practical com- 
mon sense, takes a hand in the game, the complica- 
tion is soon straightened out, and husband and wife 
are restored to each other's confidence. 

Miss Zuleika Dobson is a young lady who does 
conjuring turns in the music halls, and who irresisti- 
bly wins all masculine hearts who come within the 
range of her fatal influence. She is also a grand- 
daughter of the Warden of Judas, and comes down 
to Oxford as a self-invited guest in his household. 
Her devastating influence is felt at once, and all 
the undergraduates who catch a glimpse of her on 
the day of her arrival succumb to her fascination. 
Among them is the Duke of Dorset, a very paragon 
of accomplishment and aristocratic desirability. Un- 
fortunately, he does not dissemble his love, but boldly 
declares it, which is the worst thing he could have 
done, for Zuleika numbers her captives of all degrees 
by the thousands, and the only man she can love is 
the one who shall be quite indifferent to her charms. 
She spurns all that he offers her wealth, social 
position, titles of most sorts of nobility, and ancestral 
castles in half a dozen countries. Whereupon* he 
announces that he has resolved to die for her. When 
she sees that he means it, she half relents, but it is 
too late. She exacts from him, however, the promise 
that when he takes the plunge into the Isis for that 
is to be his mode of exit from this troublous sphere 
he will speak her name in a loud voice, so that the 
world may know the object of the unrequited love that 
has impelled him to so tragic an end. The remain- 
ing students of Judas, and of several other colleges, 
having been permitted to gaze upon the adorable 
Zuleika, and knowing that it is quite hopeless to live 
without her, when they learn of their leader's resolve, 
vow to do likewise, and so, when the appointed hour 
arrives, all the flower of young Oxford seeks (and 
finds) a watery grave. Then the lovely Zuleika, find- 
ing no other reason for remaining, packs her boxes, 
and orders a special train for Cambridge which 
it is to be presumed she will depopulate in due course 
of time, although we are left to imagine the details. 
When Zuleika drives past the Sheldonian the day of 
her arrival in Oxford great beads of perspiration come 
out on the brows of the Roman Emperors whose busts 
intersperse the railings of that edifice. The don who 
reports this alarming phenomenon is not believed at 
the time, being supposed to suffer "the hallucination

of one who had been reading too much Mommsen. He 
persisted that he had seen what he had described. It 
was not until two days had elapsed that some credence 
was accorded to him." This witty burlesque of th* 
language and action of high-flown romance is carried 
out with a wealth of invention, aided by a fantastic 
vocabulary, of which we can imagine no one b?M>l< ~ 
Mr. Max Beerbohm as being capable. His Zuleika 
Dobson " is assuredly a masterpiece of parody and 
satirical caricature of many forms of sentimental ism. 
If it does not succeed in smiling Spain's chivalry 
away altogether, it should at least prove a solemn 
warning to our ultra-romantic young writers. 

Upon a much lower plane of wit and literary 
distinction is the nevertheless vastly amusing tale, 
" The Mystery of Number 47," in which Mr. J. 
Storer Clouston parodies the popular detective story. 
It all comes about from the fact that the Molyneux 
household, in St. John's Wood, has been abandoned 
by the cook, and that the Bishop chooses just that 
time to notify Mr. Molyneux (a relative) that he is 
about to honor him with a visit The only way out 
of it seems to be for Mrs. Molyneux to retire into the 
kitchen, and for her husband to inform the Bishop 
upon his arrival that she has been unexpectedly 
called away. There is something strained about his 
reception, for Molyneux, being a simple-minded 
scholar and man of letters, does not lie with convic- 
tion, and his guest becomes suspicious. As the 
wife's absence is prolonged, and as the husband's 
explanations reveal noticeable discrepancies, suspi- 
cion ripens into a dark certainty, and the Bishop, 
resolved to get at the truth, communicates with 
Scotland Yard. Molyneux must have murdered his 
wife, and in the exceedingly attractive young woman 
(the cook) who is known to have been about the 
premises of late, the Bishop finds an adequate motive 
for the crime. Then the newspapers make a sen- 
sation of it, and No. 47 becomes a house of mys- 
tery, surrounded day and night by curious crowds. 
Molyneux disappears from the scene, and the hue 
and cry is raised. Now one of his youthful indis- 
cretions had been the writing of a detective story 
under the assumed name of " Felix Chapel." His 
publishers communicate with him under that name, 
and commission him to work up the mystery and 
make up another story out of it. To get the " atmos- 
phere " he must become acquainted with the house, 
and so, disguising himself, he obtains permission to 
go back to his own house, which is under police 
guard, and take up his residence there. The house 
has been ransacked from top to bottom without 
results, and it is up to the supposed novelist to pro- 
duce some incriminating evidence. Bones are the 
thing, and he obtains a supply from an accommo- 
dating butcher, has them buried in the garden, and 
discovered the next day. Then the horror is com- 
plete, and the gruesome details, elaborated by reporto- 
rial ingenuity, make the house an object of renewed 
public interest Some amateur sleuths join in the 
effort to probe the mystery, and to hunt down the 
dastardly murderer. When Mrs. Molyneux, who 



has been hiding in a distant hotel, turns up. the 
bubble is punctured, and her husband resumes his 
proper character. The Bishop finds it convenient 
to take a trip to South America. This entertaining 
complication is obviously suggested ly the Crippen 
case of two years ago, and is most ingeniously

Margaret of 
France and 
her timet. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

Miss Winifred Stephens, tin- author 
of an interesting volume on French 
Novelists of To- Day," published two 
or three years ago, has just brought out through the 
same publishers (Lane) a valuable life of Margaret 
of France, daughter of Francis I., sister of Henry 
II., and wife of Emmanuel Philibert Duke of Savoy. 
The book is more a rapid review of the history of 
the time than a personal biography in the narrower 
sense. The author is curiously inclined to stray off 
into a detailed account of events in which Margaret 
herself had the slightest possible part ; and the same 
tendency is apparent even in the discussions that 
make up the appendix. The fact that the Seymour 
sisters wrote some Latin poems on the death of Mar- 
garet's aunt is considered sufficient warrant for add- 
inga chapter dealingwith their lives; and Margaret's 
acquaintance with the Duke of Nemours is made the 
occasion for a twenty-page discussion of a famous 
breach of promise suit with which Margaret had not 
the slightest connection. But this inclination to wan- 
der from the main theme is by no means a fatal 
defect We owe to it the breathlessly interesting ac- 
count of the "coup de Jarnac," and a hundred other 
matters which, whether they belong to this book or 
not, are decidedly worth while. Margaret's real 
historical importance is due principally to the skil- 
ful way in which she helped build up her adopted 
nation at the expense of the land of her birth ; and 
the most serious criticism which the book deserves 
is that the period after her marriage is dismissed so 
curtly and almost hurriedly, while three-fourths of 
the space is given to her comparatively unimportant 
girlhood in France. Margaret of Savoy, the ances- 
tor of Victor Emmanuel II. by political policy and 
political fortune as well as by blood, deserves more 
attention than she has received here or elsewhere. 
There is an unusually accurate and exhaustive index, 
and the careful make-up of the book deserves high 
praise. . 

A ton of Another reverberation of the glad 

Africa in the shout of triumph with which the 
Arctic region,, attainment of the North Pole was

shape of a well-made little book entitled "A Negro 
Explorer at the North Pole" (Stokes), by Com- 
mander Peary's only companion from the civilized 
world in that last bold dash to "ninety North," Mr. 
Matthew Alexander Henson. This is the third of

able expedition of three years ago, the other two 
being the chief explorer's own full account, "The 
North Pole," and the rollicking narrative ("A Ten- 
derfoot with Peary ") by the "kid " of the party, Mr. 
George Borup. A foreword expressing warm appre- 
ciation of Mr. Henson's ability as an Arctic explorer 
is contributed by Captain Peary to the present work, 
and there is also an introduction by Dr. Booker T. 
Washington, dwelling with justifiable pride on the 
part played by those of his race, and particularly by 
Mr. Henson, in enlarging the bounds of our geograph- 
ical knowledge. The author begins his narrative 
with a sketch of his own life of his birth in Charles 
County, Maryland, in 1866, of his early going to sea, 
and of his attaching himself, twenty-three years ago, 
to the man whom he has so acceptably served nearly 
ever since and then in a score of brief and brisk 
chapters tells the story of the famous final North- 
Polar expedition from his point of view. Enthusiasm 
and local color and high spirits are not wanting in 
his pages. With characteristic exultation he chroni- 
cles the fact that "the ages of the wild misgiving 
mystery of the North Pole are over, to-day, and for- 
ever it stands under the folds of Old Glory." With 
some pardonable hyperbole he declares elsewhere: 
" From the building of the pyramids and the journey 
to the Cross, to the discovery of the new world and 
the discovery of the North Pole, the Negro had been 
the faithful and constant companion of the Caucasian, 
and I felt all that it was possible for me to feel, that 
it was I, a lowly member of my race, who had been 
chosen by fate to represent it, at this, almost the last 
of the world's great work." The brief passage de- 
voted to Dr. Cook and his alleged exploits will be 
read with interest. The book is excellently printed 
and suitably illustrated. 

The history ^ e a l reac ty have some admirable 
of classical books in English, French, and Ger- 
studies. man, dealing with the history of 

classical studies ; but there was room for a work of 
moderate length that should give essential features in 
readable form, and apparently this was the thought 
in the mind of Dr. Harry Thurston Peck in preparing 
his "History of Classical Philology" (Macmillan). 
In less than five hundred well-printed pages, the 
author carries the reader from "The Genesis of 
Philological Studies in Greece " to " The Cosmo- 
politan Period," wherein the subject now finds itself. 
Although he does not claim to do much more than 
criticize and organize material already available, the 
technical journals will record not a few serious criti- 
cisms and many differences of opinion; but they 
will doubtless conclude by saying that the author 
has achieved success in his modest aims. To the 
reader who is not primarily a classical student we 
may hint that he will not find the book nearly as 
dreary as the title might suggest. Whatever may 
become of Latin and Greek in modern education, 
the influence of classical studies on the development 
of occidental life will long continue to be important ; 
and it is very possible to be interested in many phases 



of the subject. Moreover, as one turns the leaves of 
such a book as this, one will find interspersed in the 
pages of information an occasional paragraph that 
is quietly joyous. For instance, in view of the con- 
troversy about abolishing "the stern door of com- 
pulsory Greek" at Oxford and Cambridge, it is 
gladsome to learn that the Latinists of the Isis once 
opposed the study of the nobler tongue so bitterly, and 
the animosity of "Greeks" and "Trojans" became 
so rampant, that parties of them took to fighting in 
the streets. Almost equally pleasing is this forcible 
declaration of Gregory the Great: "The place of 
prepositions and the case of nouns I utterly despise ; 
for I consider it indecent to confine the words of 
the heavenly prophets within the rules of Donatus." 
The volume closes felicitously with the famous credo 
of Gaston Paris, beginning: "I profess absolutely 
and without reserve this doctrine, that science has no 
other aim than truth, and truth for its own sake, with- 
out care for the consequences, good or ill, regrettable 
or happy, which that truth might have in practice." 
We regret to note many slips in presentation that 
should not have been missed in the proof ; but it may 
be that such faults are more distressing to reviewers 
than to other readers.

fell in the course of his recent Harvard lectures on 
the William Belden Noble foundation. "The Ad- 
venture of Life" is the stimulating title given to the 
lectures as now published in book form by the Hough- 
ton Mifflin Co. The general purpose of the lecture- 
ship, as expressed by its founder, is "To extend the 
influence of Jesus as the way, the truth, and the 
life," and "beyond a sympathy with the purpose of 
the Lectures, as thus defined, no restriction is placed 
upon the lecturer." With the freedom thus allowed 
him, Dr. Grenfell has drawn largely and with ex- 
cellent effect upon his own rich and varied experi- 
ence as minister to the bodies and souls of suffering 
humanity on the Labrador coast, and it is only 
natural that so practical and energetic a Christian 
worker should emphasize the importance of works 
as compared with faith, of the will to believe and 
to prove one's belief in deeds as compared with 
mere passive intellectual conviction. "If there is 
iniquity," he says, "in accepting a course for true, 
the axioms of which cannot be demonstrated by 
mathematics, this is the reason why I rejoice in my 
iniquity (in accepting the Christian faith). My choice 
has given me much fun in life, and still promises to 
do so, for no capacities need go unused in the 
field of Christian adventure." A little later he says, 
with a touch of the humor and the shrewdness that 
so delightfully relieve his discourse of any musty 
academic flavor: "Without question unfaith is too 
often a synonym for 'don't want.' It is like the 
farmer who, when urged to give up whiskey, re-

A notabU 

exhibition of in aid of the National Art Collections 
out Matter,. Fund> held at the Qrafton Galleries 
in London during the last three months of 1911, 
afforded a rare opportunity for viewing some of the 
art treasures in private ownership in England. It 
was notable for the number of important paintings 
by celebrated artists that had not been previously 
exhibited. No less than thirty-two out of a total 
of one hundred and seventeen not counting draw- 
ings and water colors were shown for the first 
time. Among these, the two beautiful paintings by 
Filippino Lippi, owned by Sir Henry B. Samuelson, 
Bart., and the Rev. A. F. Sutton's superb - Madonna 
and Child Enthroned with Angels," by Masaccio, 
call for particular mention. Of even greater inter- 
est to students are a number of canvases attributed 
to various masters, such as Lady Jekyll's Giotto, 
Lord Walsingham's reputed Titian (which Sir Claude 
Phillips and other critics regard as by another hand), 
and the Portrait of a Young Man, owned by Mrs. 
Alfred Morrison, which though traditionally ascribed 
to Lucas Van Leyden is now thought to be a work 
by his follower and imitator, Bartholomaus de Bruyn 
of Cologne. The Catalogue of this exhibition (Lon- 
don: Phillip Lee Warner) has been prepared by 
Messrs. Roger E. Fry and Maurice W. Brock well, 
who have made it a work of permanent value. A 
concise verbal description of each of the pictures is 
given, followed by the history of the picture as far 
as it is known, by a list of the times and places 
where it had been previously exhibited together with 
the catalogue numbers assigned to it, and by refer- 
ences to critical mention of it in books and periodicals. 
In many instances, also, the opinions of well-known 
authorities are cited in brief quotations from their 
writings. The book is a quarto, handsomely printed 
by the Ballantyne Press. It is furnished with ample 
indices. Lord Penrhyn's fine Rembrandt is repro- 
duced in photogravure as a frontispiece, and collo- 
type reproductions of eighty of the pictures are 
grouped at the end of the volume. 

The charm of Opening in the middle Mr. Fergus 
an Kngiih Graham's prose idyl, "The House of 
countrv how. Dornell " (Dodd), we come face to 
face with one of the most engaging characters of the 
book. "The Colonel" wears a Victoria Cross, but 
" thinks nothing of the deed that won him fame, and 
I do not suppose it ever strikes him that his action on 
the battlefield was in any way brave or remarkable. 
He is modest, like all true heroes, and like a child 
he is simple. Old, stout, white-haired, he comes to 
Dornell with his cheery laugh, a laugh that chokes 
. him when the jest is good, and his arrival is like the 
coming of a gale, because we have to roar at him to 
make him hear. He is a boy among boys, there never 



was a heart so young as his, and few young men can 
appreciate the smaller joys of life as he can." The 
book concerns itself with the Dornell country house 
and its surroundings, with its inmates, especially its 
children, servants, and dogs, and with some of its 
visiting kinsfolk and friends. Quaint descriptive 
appellations are given to some of the characters, as 
"The Kind One," "The Baa-lamb," "The Beloved," 
a 1 1 . 1 * The Scratches" The supposed teller of the tale, 
which is not a tale, but rather a series of humorous 
character-sketches, is apparently an amiable idler 
with a great fondness for children and simple things, 
who says of himself and his juvenile friends: "It 
tickles my conceit, too, that they should choose me 
for a friend, and the honour of being one is worth 
a few sore ribs. The mystic realm called the child- 
world is no foreign land to me, because three of my 
best comrades dwell there, comrades I would not ex- 
change for the dozen wisest heads that ever wagged." 
Lovers of what is genuine and unspoilt in human 
character, and of what is simple and spontaneous 
and kindly in human relations, will take pleasure in 
the book. 

A Bhakewtare N 8ma11 P art f the P rennial >' 
"forgery" terest attaching to Shakespeare is 

re-examined. ft ue to t jj e way j n wn ich settled ques- 
tions refuse to stay settled. Here is Mr. Ernest 
P. A. Law, with a volume of eighty pages on " Some 
Supposed Shakespeare Forgeries" (Macniillan), de- 
claring that certain leaves in the Revels Books of 
the period of James the First, long bninded as for- 
geries, are unmistakably genuine. The contents of 
these books were published by their discoverer, 
Peter Cunningham, in the publications of the Shake- 
speare Society for 1842, when they were accepted 
as genuine. But when, twenty-six years later, Cun- 
ningham attempted to sell several of the documents 
to the British Museum, they were seized and turned 
over to the Record Office. At the same time the 
pages for 1604-1605 and 1611-1612, the former 
containing a record of the presentation of "The 
Moor of Venice," "Measure for Measure" (by 
"Shaxberd"), etc., and the latter "The Tempest," 
"The Winter's Night's Tale," etc., were declared 
to be palpable forgeries, and this judgment ha* !>f-n 
all but universally acquiesced in ever since. The 
matter was of great interest, especially because of 
its bearing on the long-standing controversy over tin- 
date of "Othello," which it effectually settled and 
unsettled in turn. Meantime that controversy was 
once more practically settled by the discovery of 
Malone's memorandum, made a century ago, which 
now appears to have been a transcript of these very 
pages. The proof that the pages are after all genuine 
would appear to be the last and of course the most 
desirable link in the entire chain of evidence. Mr. 
Law has printed a facsimile of two of the pages, 
accompanied by a convincing array of arguments 
and proofs ; and his entire story, in spite of a lawyer- 
like style, adds a most interesting chapter to the his- 
tory of Shakespeare controversy.

Platitudes When the Spanish Infanta Eulalia 

of a royal published not long ago a collection 

philosopher. o f philosophical essays over the nom 
de plume of " Comtesse d'Avila," her royal nephew 
became highly indignant, reprimanded her severely, 
and even threatened to suppress the book. This 
method of advertising proved so successful that the 
volume has not only enjoyed a large sale in its orig- 
inal French, but now appears in an English trans- 
lation, bearing the title "The Thread of Life" 
(Duffield). There are twenty-six short essays in the 
collection, preceded by a preface in which the author 
informs her prospective readers that it is "a senti- 
ment of modesty " that prompts her to maintain an 
incognito on the cover of the book, whereas the 
preface itself is very carefully signed with her name. 
Then she proceeds to discuss, "with the sincere con- 
viction that I have always shown in the expression 
of my ideas and opinions," such subjects as divorce, 
of which she heartily approves; the family, which 
she regards, without any apparent regret, as in pro- 
cess of disintegration ; the complete independence of 
woman, which she favors ; religion, which she ranks 
among the useful superstitions that may in time 
become unnecessary; morality, an arbitrary set of 
rules which are in constant process of amendment; 
honesty, friendship, moral courage, judgment, and 
other edifying themes for rather purposeless plati- 
tudinizing. It was no more than natural that King 
Alfonso should have been troubled at catching his 
outspoken aunt publicly deriding the "divine right" 
theory, attacking the Catholic Church, and bewailing 
the backwardness of the Latin races ; but he can at 
least console himself with the reflection that she is 
neither thinker enough nor artist enough to carry a 
high degree of conviction. 

Cliff and ^ must be nearly time to speak of 

cave dwellings the Rev. Sabine Baring-Gould as a 
in Europe. veteran author, for he has now passed 

his seventy-seventh birthday and his published vol- 
umes date from 1854. His books include lives of the 
saints, collections of sermons and religious polemics, 
popular hymns, religious biographies, books of travels, 
studies in folk-lore, archaeology, and history in all 
more than seventy titles. A perusal of some of the 
Reports of the Bureau of American Ethnology on 
the cliff dwellings of the Colorado region, and some 
of the magazine articles which have grown out of 
those reports, have revived in his mind memories of 
troglodytes in Europe ; and with a thorough knowl- 
edge of the subject, he has written a book on "Cliff 
Castles and Cave Dwellings of Europe " (Lippincott) 
in which he describes the use of cliffs and caves as 
habitation for protective and economic reasons not 
only in pre-historic and early historic times, but even 
in modern and present times. He writes of these 
modern cave-dwellings, and of the remains of many 
of the others, at first hand, and furnishes some of the 
illustrations for the book. His style is characteris- 
tically popular, though he seems in some instances 
to descend to trivialities. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Professor Curtis Hidden Page's admirable transla- 
tions from Moliere are re-issued by the Messrs. Put- 
nam in four small volumes "Tartuffe" in one, " Le 
Bourgeois Gentilhomme " in another, " Les Femmes 
Savantes " in a third, and " Les Pre"cieuses Ridicules " 
and " Le Medecin Malgre* Lui " in the fourth. Plays 
(even the classics) have a chance of getting read now- 
a-days, and the recent performances in Chicago and 
elsewhere of " Les Femmes Savantes " by the Drama 
Players have made many people realize that the author 
is by no means dead, and that he makes a genuine 
appeal to a modern audience. 

A book for which there was decided need is Mr. Bol- 
ton Hall's " What Tolstoy Taught," published by Mr. 
B. W. Huebsch. It is made up of extracts from Tolstoy's 
own writings, arranged under various headings so as to 
present in orderly sequence the views and teachings of 
the great Russian reformer. The contents are divided 
into two main sections, " On Life " and "On Action "; 
with various sub-divisions bearing such titles as " The 
Selfish Love," "The Pursuit of Happiness," "The Fear 
of Death," " The Balm for Suffering," " Women and 
Men," "Alcohol and Tobacco," and "The Great In- 
iquity." As a convenient summary of Tolstoy's essential 
doctrine, the book should find a wide field of usefulness. 

The American Institute of Criminal Law and Crimi- 
nology has rendered a great service by publishing 
(through Messrs. Little, Brown & Co.) an excellent 
translation of "The Individualization of Punishment " 
by R. Saleilles, Professor in the University of Paris. 
The work is a keen criticism of the classic doctrine 
that the " punishment should fit the crime " without 
much regard to effects on the criminal and the perma- 
nent welfare of the community. The agreement with 
the main tendencies of the reformers in America is 
remarkable and encouraging, and the criticism of those 
tendencies is wholesome. One serious error of the orig- 
inal has not been corrected, the statement (p. 300) that 
Elmira Reformatory is a " private " and not a state 
institution. 

However near at hand the millenium may actually 
be, the plain man of to-day is apt to feel that his own 
personal stake in the goods of a Golden Age is still re- 
mote and hypothetical. Mr. Ritter Brown, in discussing 
"Man's Birthright" (Desmond FitzGerald), sees this 
fact very clearly, and so does what he can for the indi- 
vidual of the present day as well as for the society of 
to-morrow in his construction of an ideal society. The 
main point of Mr. Brown's argument is that the chief 
source of our social evils is the divorce of man from 
the land, and that in keeping up the present undesirable 
state of affairs an important part is played by repre- 
sentative government. In lieu of these things, he advo- 
cates equal access to land and the relegation of the 
representative form of government to secondary affairs, 
all matters of the first magnitude to be decided by the 
votes of the whole people instead of by the more partisan 
and prejudiced decisions of their representatives. The 
author's interest in the man of to-day as an individual 
appears in an appendix, in which are gathered from 
many sources a number of hints on various out-of-the- 
way kinds of farming and horticultural pursuits, to the 
end that the man who does not want to await political 
and constitutional changes to better his condition may 
seek the land at once and be happy and prosperous.

NOTES. 

" The Flaw in the Crystal " is the title of a novel by 
M;i\ >mrl.ui uhii-h Mc^rs. K 1'. 1 Miitmi <S: Co. 
announce for early publication. 

To their extensive list of books on Socialism, the Mao- 
mil Ian Co. will add this month a study of " Socialism 
as It Is," by Mr. William English Walling. 

Among the Carpathians," by Mr. Lion Phillimore, 
is an unconventional account of gipsy-like travel in good 
company and through hitherto undescribed country, 
which Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. will publish immedi- 
ately. 

Madame Steinheil, the Frenchwoman whose recent 
trial on the charge of murder attracted world-wide 
notice, has written an autobiography. Messrs. Sturgis 
& Walton Co. announce the American edition as nearly 
ready. 

Professor James Schouler is now at work on the sev- 
enth volume of his great " History of the United States 
under the Constitution." The new volume will cover 
the administrations of Johnson and Grant the Recon- 
struction pehod. 

" Pageants and Pageantry," by Esther Willard Bates 
and William Orr, will be issued shortly by Messrs. Ginn 
& Co. It is a manual of suggestion for the producer of 
pageants, with much historical material drawn from the 
past records of pageantry. 

Mr. William Archer is preparing for early publication 
a volume called "Play-making: A Manual of Crafts- 
manship." No English writer has made a closer study 
of the modern drama than Mr. Archer, and his book 
should easily take the foremost position in its field. 

Studies in Radical Empiricism " by William James 
is announced for early publication by Messrs. Longmans, 
Green & Co. This firm has also iu preparation a hitherto- 
unannounced volume of "Selected Addresses " by James 
B. Angell, late President Emeritus of the University of 
Michigan. 

"The Poems and Masks of Aurelian Townsend," 
edited by Mr. E. K. Chambers, will soon be added to 
the " Tudor and Stuart Library," published by the 
Oxford University Press. To their series of " Oxford 
Poets " the same publishers announce the addition of 
Spenser, edited by Messrs. J. C. Smith and Ernest de 
Silincourt. 

A new book by Miss Ellen Key, the famous Swedish 
writer on feminism, is announced by Messrs. Putnam. 
Its title is "Tlu- Woman's Movement," and it deals 
with the new phase which feminism is now assuming. 
According to Miss Key, this consists in a determination 
to regard men's privileges as subordinate to the rights 
of women as the mothers and educators of the coming 
generation. 

Some spring announcements of the Oxford University 
Press not hitherto recorded in these columns are " The 
Science of Etymology," by Dr. W. W. Skeat; " A Com- 
panion to Roman History," by Mr. H. Stuart Jones; 
" The Greek Genius and Its Meaning to Us," by Mr. 
R. W. Livingstone ; Problems of the Roman Criminal 
Law," by Mr. J. L. Strachan- Davidson; and a "Con- 
cordance to Dante's Latin Works." 

" The Memoirs of Francesco Crispi," announced for 
publication by the George H. Doran Co., will un- 
doubtedly prove one of the most important books of the 
year. Crispi has long been overshadowed by Cavour in 
the history of Italian Unity, hut it is said that the forth- 



coming work will make necessary a new appraisal 
of their relative positions. The translation, by Mary 
Pritchard Agnetti, is from documents collected and 
edited by Thomas Palamenghi Crispi. The work uill 
comprise three volumes, the first two of which are to 
appear May 1, the other following shortly after. 

Mr. Edward Carpenter's new book, " The Drama of 
Love and Death : A Study of Human Evolution and 
Transfiguration," will be an interesting feature of the 
spring season. The earlier chapters will be a kind of 
continuation of " Love's Coming of Age," while the 
latter part deals with the problems of Death and the 
Hereafter, throughout copious reference being made to 
late discoveries in the domains of physics, biology, and 
psychical research. 

"The Strangling of Persia," by Mr. W. Morgan 
Sinister, ex-Treasurer-General of Persia, is announced 
for early publication by the Century Co. This firm 
has also in press the following books, not heretofore an- 
nounced: "The Social Drift: Studies in Contemporary 
Society," by Professor Edward Alsworth Ross; " Social 
Life in the Insect World," by J. H. Fabre; and new novels 
by Messrs. Samuel Merwin and David Gray. 

Tabloid knowledge for the masses seems to be the 
feature of the moment in publishing. First we had the 
" Temple Cyclopaedic Primers," then the " Cambridge 
Manuals of Science and Art," then the " Home Univer- 
sity Library." Now a new series, " The People's Books," 
is to enter the field, sponsored by Messrs. Jack of Lon- 
don, and issued in this country by the Dodge Publishing 
Company. In one respect, at least, the new series will 
have a heavy advantage, being offered at nearly half 
the price of its least expensive competitor. A prospectus 
of the first sixty volumes presents a strong array of 
writers, and indicates that every field of knowledge and 
thought will be competently covered. 

The New York Public Library has been recently ex- 
hibiting a collection from the largest library of rare and 
interesting textbooks in the world. The collection is 
the property of Mr. George A. Plimpton, a member of 
the firm of Ginn & Company. Especially noteworthy 
is the exhibit of arithmetics, which begins with a manu- 
script of Boethius, dating from the eleventh century. A 
copy of the first printed arithmetic, published in Treviso 
iu 1478, is included, as is also a manuscript of the first 
European algebra dating from 1400. Algebra and geom- 
etry in first editions and manuscripts, including an Arabic 
manuscript of the works of Euclid and an algebra trans- 
lated from the Arabic of the ninth century, are interest- 
ing features. 

The first number of " Bedrock," a new quarterly re- 
view of scientific thought, published by Messrs. Con- 
stable & Co., Ltd. of London, opens with an article on 
" The Value of a Logic of Method " by Professor J. 
Welton, Professor of Education in the University of 
Leeds; G. Archdall Reid discusses " Recent Researches 
on Alcoholism"; E. W. Poulton, Hope Professor of 
Zoology in the University of Oxford, writes on " Dar- 
win and Bergson as Interpreters of Evolution ''; A. H. 
Gibson, Professor of Engineering in the University of 
Dundee, has an article on " The Inter-Action of Pass- 
ing Ships." The number also includes articles on "The 
Stars in their Courses " (being substantially the Halley 
Lecture for 1911) \>> H I! I UHI.T, Savilian Professor 
of Astronomy in the University of Oxford, and on " So- 
cial and Sexual Evolution" by The Hermit of Prague, 
as well as some " Notes on Current Research."

edge of the problem and of the difficulties which the 
movement encounters. He has made an effort to 
canvass the whole field and to give a detailed expo- 
sition of the forces employed in building up a rational 
course of agricultural education. He has presented 
more fully than anyone else the materials which define 
the problem and which make it possible for the teacher 
to meet it intelligently. The annotated bibliography 
at the end of the book will do much to make the best 
material available for anyone desiring to get hold of 
this material through independent study. The book 
serves, therefore, as a general introduction to the 
study of agricultural education.

SCHOOL AND COLLEGE. 



The college has had to bear the brunt of 
many assaults during recent years, from the 
rude thrusts of the weaver's beam in the hands 
of the philistine to the volleys that come from 
the ranks of a purblind democracy that resents 
anything like distinction in education just as it 
resents the distinctions of wealth and social 
position. The firing along this latter line is 
somewhat irritating in its persistence, and it has 
weakened not a little the work of higher educa- 
tion. It finds a shining mark in every form of 
educational endeavor that is not obviously cor- 
related with the day's work of securing a liveli- 
hood, although the activities with which it seeks 
to displace the tested and approved forms of edu- 
cational discipline have by no means been shown 
to be justified by their fruits. These material 
objects look well to the " practical " vision, they 
give a business-like appearance to college cata- 
logues, and they provide the pedagogical dem- 
agogue with an unlimited opportunity for the 
outlet of his rhetorical energy in the newspaper, 
the political gathering, and the educational con- 
ference. But those who urge them are content 
when their adoption has been secured, and do 
not care to investigate their application. In- 
deed, the searching analysis which would be re- 
quired to determine the extent to which these 
educational prescriptions were actually fitting 
young people for life is a task far beyond the 
powers of those who are so noisy in their ad- 
vocacy. 

Most of our current popular discussion of edu- 
cational problems is superficial or empty because 
it has catch-phrases rather than ideas for its 
subject-matter. It sounds plausible to say that 
the schools should fit boys and girls for the practi- 
cal work of life, and that knowledge of the world 
of to-day is more useful to them than all the lore 
of the past. And it is always easy to raise a 
cheap laugh about little Johnny's father, suc- 
cessful man of affairs, who is quite unable to 
help his puzzled offspring solve a geometrical 
problem. A California educator was horrified 
the other day when it appeared that the students 
in the high schools of the State knew more about 
Eoman history than they did about current 
events. " Are our American schools preparing

Roman citizens?" was his indignant outcry, and 
the sympathy evoked by a protest of this sort is 
quite as cheap as the laughter with which we 
greet the lamentable case of little Johnny's 
father. All these complaints about the " unprac- 
tical" character of our teaching are made in 
almost total ignorance of education in its deeper 
nature and underlying purpose, and in entire 
misapprehension of the argument by which any 
education at public expense is to be justified. 
It is, to put it brutally, of vital consequence to 
the State that little Johnny should be prepared 
to exercise the duties of intelligent citizenship, 
but of no particular consequence (to the State) 
that he should be fitted to earn a living. That 
is clearly his personal affair, and his self-interest 
may safely be left to deal with it. It is not the 
hungry man, but the illiterate man, whose exist- 
ence is a menace to the social organization, and 
whom it is the bounden duty of society to extir- 
pate as a condition of self-preservation. 

A great plaint now goes up all over the land 
to the effect that the colleges are tyrannizing 
over the schools, restraining their generous 
impulse to let children have what they want (or 
what their uninformed parents would like them 
to have), and forcing their work along fruitless 
ways into narrow channels. These arrogant 
institutions, it is urged, close their eyes to the 
conditions of modern life, with its increasing 
multiplicity of interests, and fail to frame their 
programmes with an eye to the main chance, 
that is, with reference to the demands of the 
labor-market. The voice that makes this plea is 
so plainly the voice of unwisdom that it is diffi- 
cult to be patient with it. In a rational view of 
the matter, the colleges are engaged in a desper- 
ate effort to maintain any sort of an educational 
standard in the face of an opposition that cares 
nothing for standards, that is debasing them in 
every direction, and that wishes boys and girls 
to be passed through college with a minimum 
of exertion. Throughout the years that precede 
the college, the minds of young people are encour- 
aged to develop along the paths of least resist- 
ance, and then, when they would further pursue 
the path, they are pained to discover that the col- 
leges require them to exhibit some evidences of 
fitness for the serious work of education. For 
years they have been free to select the safest 
courses, have taken bookkeeping instead of 
physics and domestic science instead of geome- 
try, for years they have dawdled along, under 
conditions that make for mental flabbiness or 
worse, and then a halt is called, and they realize 
that most of their school life has been wasted, and 



that they have not been preparing themselves for 
college at all, but merely marking time. They 
have IM-VT ar<|iiiiv<l tin- hal.it >t" accuracy, and 
they have never l>een forced to buckle down to 
stiff problems and work them out by sheer 
dogged determination. Our sentimentalized 
and emasculated school systems have put them 
through a mere travesty of the educational 
process, and they find themselves helpless in the 
face of the demands which any self-respecting 
college must make upon the students whom it 
admits within its precincts. 

All honor, we say, to those institutions which 
refuse to serve the time, but which serve instead 
that ideal of intellectual attainment which it is 
the sacred duty of the college to keep alive. Too 
many of our colleges are ignominiously betraying 
their cause, and weakening under the pressure 
of an unenlightened public demand for easier 
entrance requirements and a more liberal variety 
of the credits that may be offered. Some of our 
largest institutions are willing to receive untested 
any student who brings the certificate of a high 
school even of a high school that reduces to a 
disgraceful minimum its specific requirements 
for a diploma. A boy or girl may gain entrance 
into one of these colleges without algebra or 
geometry, without physics, or without knowledge 
of any foreign language whatsoever. All he need 
offer is a miscellaneous assortment of credits suf- 
ficient to make up the required total ; and in this 
democracy of interests, a course in blacksmith- 
work counts for as much as a course in Greek. 
No wonder the colleges that thus throw wide open 
their doors are swollen in numbers, for the car In t 
of a college education is still held to be of value, 
even if the substance bear no relation to what the 
term has hitherto been supposed to connote. 

Education, as it was conceived in this country 
a generation ago, was a reasonably solid struc- 
ture, honestly built up from foundation-stone to 
coping. What lias been going on of recent 
years has been a steady undermining of the 
masonry, substituting rubble and clay and other 
unfitting material for the lower courses, and then 
demanding that the superstructure should be 
determined by the needs of the material upon 
which it rests. It is jerry-building gone mad. 
Only here and there do we find colleges (and 
in them is our educational hope) that maintain 
a firm stand for the humanities and the disci- 
plines, that refuse to admit students without real 
preparation, that refuse to keep them unless they 
do real work, and that do not fritter away their 
energies by multiplying courses of dubious value, 
but place their main reliance upon the subjects

that have proved their power to strengthen the 
mind and mould the character. Little Johnny, 
who "never could understand algebra," and who 
did not "take" physics because the hard work 
would be "bad for his health," and who passed 
Latin by because he did not expect to "need it 
in his business," would be excluded from such 
a college, for the all-sufficient reason that it had 
better work to do than licking boys like him 
into shape. Such a college would make but a 
poor showing in the competition for numbers, 
and might be hard put to it for endowments; 
but its graduates would be likely to give a good 
account of themselves, and it would be as a light 
set upon a hill in the educational landscape. 



DO WE KNOW WHAT WE WANT 
IN EDUCATION? 



The proof of the pudding is the eating thereof. 
For two or three generations in America we have 
been engaged in the most extensive and expensive 
educational concoction ever known. What is the re- 
sult? What is the flavor and taste of our product? 
Will it gain us a prize in the country fair of the world ? 
Will we get a blue ribbon for intellect, for manners, 
or for morals ? 

These are questions which would require an expert 
commission to investigate. They cannot be settled 
offhand by an essayist. But one may offer some 
considerations which tend to throw our success into 
doubt. 

Education ought to mean civilization, and civiliza- 
tion largely consists in conserving and honoring the 
best that mankind has known or done. Is there any 
such reverence in America for what the race has pro- 
nounced good? Or is not our attitude towards the 
past typified by one of our most popular books 
Mark Twain's ''Innocents Abroad"? But it is not 
only the actual deeds of the ages that we despise ; it 
is the tone, air, and sentiment of what is greatest and 
highest in human thought and action. Speak to the 
average educated American about poetry, and he will 
turn upon you with an idiotic laugh. Speak to him 
of romance or devotion or self-sacrifice, and he will 
regard you with a lack-lustre eye. Very likely this 
same self-satisfied citizen has in him the elements of 
poetry and devotion. But surely education ought to 
educe and bring them to the surface. We have paid 
enough to have our diamonds polished, and ought not 
to be obliged to wear them in the rough. 

Humor is a great asset for a people. It makes for 
cheerfulness, sanity, and endurance. But it may be 
questioned whether we have not too strong a strain 
of it in our character. The Broad Grin overspreads 
all our part of the American Continent. Pretty 
nearly everything is viewed from a humorous stand- 
point. In our best authors this is called irony. If 



all distinction, beauty, profundity, and power are to 
be delivered over to the domination of the Comic 
Muse, there is bound to ensue a vast and deep vul- 
garization of life itself. 

Let us turn to our morals, for there we proclaim 
ourselves strong. Well, there is an immense amount 
of preaching amongst us. Everybody preaches, so 
I suppose everybody performs. One of the most 
curious features of this didactic set is our passion for 
maxims, axioms, precepts. Every newspaper keeps 
a Solomon on tap to pour these forth in a steady 
stream. There never was anything like it before. 
English literature has always run to concrete exam- 
ple rather than to precept. Chesterfield and Samuel 
Smiles are almost the only authors who occur to us 
as purely givers of advice. Of course all such work 
denotes a primitive state of mind in those who accept 
it. It is like the chairs and stools by aid of which 
a child learns to walk. As soon as people can trust 
themselves they disdain all such half truths or whole 
falsities. 

Have we any settled ideal in this country towards 
which we direct our education ? Other peoples have 
known what they wanted from education. The Greeks 
wanted to produce a race of athletes and artists 
to attain to harmonious perfection of body and mind. 
They did attain to that : they made humanity statu- 
esque and reached a hegemony in some of the arts 
which they still hold. The Romans educated for 
war and domination. The churchmen, into whose 
hands education fell in the Middle Ages, educated 
for the other world. They produced a race of spirit- 
ual enthusiasts who swayed the world with their vis- 
ions, and who brought something of heaven down 
to earth in their architecture, painting, music, and 
sculpture. The French have educated mainly for 
manners, for social charm ; the Spanish for the cul- 
tivation of a stately personal pride. Bismarck's jest 
that as England owned the sea and Russia owned the 
land, there was nothing left for the Germans but the 
sky, is borne out by Germany's greatest achievements 
metaphysics and music. England is perhaps the 
only country which has educated for literature. I 
do not mean by this that it has not educated for 
other things, war, domination, science, but that 
through its whole educational system, and through 
the common thought of its people, runs a feeling, 
an acknowledgement that literature is the best work 
that men can do. As a result English literature is 
the greatest in existence. Is there any single thing 
that American education has aimed at? Faith, I 
cannot think of any, unless it is Big Business. 

Leigh Hunt, who lived during his boyhood in this 
country, said that he never thought of the United 
States without seeing a great counter extending the 
whole length of our Atlantic seaboard. I am afraid 
that this counter still exists, and branches off in all 
directions over our domain. In very truth we have 
educated mainly for practical ends, and to that effect 
have accepted Science as our guide. We have the 
excuse that it was ours to break in and subdue a 



344

[May 1, 



continent We need strong tools to do this, and 
the incitement of gain to keep us at our work. The 
present writer spent a good section of his life in this 
sort of thing railroad building and he has the 
utmost sympathy and admiration for the men who 
pioneer material existence. But the finest flower 
of civilization is not born amid such men or such 
scenes. It is not born amid any people who accept 
business and science as the " be all " and the " end 
all " here. 

Religion and art are ends in themselves. They 
are finalities, lasting satisfactions. But Science is 
only a means. The word of Science always is, "and 
then, and then, and then." We do not build bridges 
or railroads to sit down and look at them with ec- 
static joy, we build them to get somewhere. Even 
when radium is isolated or the spectrum of a nebula 
established, these successes are only steps in utili- 
tarian progress. 

We have built our faith on Science, and the foun- 
dations are giving beneath us. Many of the greatest 
men of science of the day are harking back to the 
old tracks of metaphysics and religion. Not only 
that, but Science is betraying us in a material way. 
It promised to make life easier and happier for us. 
Well, in the past year or so the whole world has 
known the pinch of hunger. We have felt it par- 
ticularly in America, and have savagely resented it. 
If Big Business and Science together cannot fill our 
stomachs, what good are they ? We have boasted of 
our unparalleled prosperity in America. We forgot 
that other ages and places have also been prosper- 
ous. There is a legend of " Merrie England," where 
everyone had enough to eat and plenty of time for 
sport and recreation. There were ages when the 
pleasant country of France, or Italy the beautiful, 
were paradises. And all this was before the time 
of Big Business or Science. Obviously no single 
formula of education will answer even for material 
perfection. 

Probably there is no better test of the results of 
a nation's education than the way in which success- 
ful people of all kinds rank in public estimation 
the off-hand precedence which is accorded them. In 
America to-day the men who are most and first in 
the public mind, who are the objects of general 
envy and emulation, are the wielders of vast 
wealth, the masters of finance. Then, perhaps, 
come the statesmen, though they win their places as 
by an ordeal of fire. Then rank the men of science 
of all kinds, inventors, investigators, engineers, 
educators, physicians, and the like. Far down on 
the roll rank the soldiers, and at the bottom of the 
list come the clergy, the poets, and the artists. 
Surely this is a spectacle of a world upside down, 
of a world waving its useful but humble locomotive 
members in the air while its head "and features, 
the great soul's apparent seat " grovel in the dust. 
From the beginning of time, in nearly all places, two 
orders of men have been dominant, have absorbed 
the interest and attention of mankind. These have 



been the poets and the soldiers using those terms. 
of course, in a generic, in the widest allowable sense. 
The records of Hindoo life are largely devoted to 
the strife between these two classes, with all the 
other castes of men trailing on behind, unregarded. 
Similarly the old Celtic literature knew only two 
kinds of personages, warriors and bards. And 
of course every great epoch in European history is 
made glorious by a circle of heads belonging to 
these two orders of men. Of all the vast accumula- 
tion of the biographical literature of the world, prob- 
ably nine-tenths is devoted to men of the sword and 
the pen. The settled judgment of the world seems 
to be that anybody can be useful but that only these 
are interesting. All of us who read for love rove 
like bees from the accounts of battles to the records 
of literary and artistic struggles and triumphs. 
Somehow we feel that the great in these fields 
express, incarnate, life more fully than any others. 
Who takes an interest in the ledgers of Venetian 
merchants or the records of German guilds. Yet 
in America we are trying to reverse this decision of 
all time, we are trying to place financiers, busi- 
ness men, and scientists on the thrones of the world. 
Now no one doubts the power, the utility, or the i n< 1 1- 
pensableness of such men. Doubtless their similars 
have always had their share of contemporary regard. 
Money talks, even if it rarely says anything worth 
listening to. But I think the dazzled eye with which 
we regard such potentates is a new thing. 

Probably the spirit of a nation dictates its system 
of education, and to tell it to change that system is 
equivalent to telling it to be born again. But we 
must make some change in our ideas and ideals if we 
want to cut the figure in the world which we have a 
right to do. Perhaps we might take a hint from the 
Catholic Church, which is perhaps the wisest organi- 
zation ever known, and, in a way, the most democratic. 
It has never evinced an overwhelming desire for a 
general intellectual education. It has preferred to 
train the great mass of its people in manners and 
morals, and to reserve its treasures of culture for the 
most promising pupils. We fight against the idea, 
in America, that there is any inequality in natural 
gifts, and we try to give everybody an even chance. 
This is praiseworthy of course, but it is impossible. 
The texture of men's minds differs more than the 
grain of wood in the forest*. As a corollary to our 
democratic endeavors in this way, we come to the 
conclusion that one kind of gift, one kind of success, 
one kind of achievement, is as good as any other. 
But it is not. There are hierarchies of talents : there 
are some kinds of genius so rare that they outvalue 
all the rest. We must recognize this or our education 
will be a muddle. We must recognize too that there 
are limitations to physical and material endeavor, 
that we cannot all be rich, or even comparatively well 
off; and that we had best try to lay up treasures of 
emotion, intellect, and spirit which will endure and 
console.

CAS UAL COMMENT. 
MAKING THE FULLEST USE OF AN EDUCATIONAL 
PLANT (to apply an industrial term to what may be 
regarded as a great intellectual industry) obviously 
requires that the plant shall not stand idle any great 
part of the time. An all-the-year-round use of public 
school buildings for the good of the public is com- 
ing more and more to be looked upon with favor, 
although the proposal, as made by Mr. John Cotton 
Dana some years ago in "The Independent," evoked 
at first vigorous protest and little or no encouraging 
response. To say nothing of the benefits to accrue 
from longer school terms and shorter summer vaca- 
tions, one obvious way of making the schoolhouse 
publicly useful throughout the year is to connect it, 
wherever practicable, with the public library system 
and cause it to shelter a branch library, or perhaps 
even the main library itself where a separate build- 
ing cannot yet be provided. The town of Pomfret, 
Vermont, has adopted the suggestion of its progres- 
sive librarian, Mrs. Abba Do ton Chamberlin, and 
constituted each of its schoolhouses a branch library, 
numbered as is the school district it serves. Grand 
Rapids, Michigan, is another town (or city in this 
instance) that has successfully met the need of addi- 
tional branch library buildings by utilizing its school- 
houses for the purpose. One of the Grand Rapids 
teachers admirably expounded the advantages result- 
ing from this coordination of educational effort in an 
address before thelibrary section of the'Michigan State 
Teachers' Association at Detroit last November. (See 
this paper, " The Use of the Library in the Grades," in 
"The Library Journal" for April.) In the South, 
school libraries are abundant, and are increasing, as 
interestingly set forth by Mr. Louis R. Wilson, libra- 
rian of the University of North Carolina, in a paper 
read before the Southern Educational Association last 
December and now printed in the above-named issue 
of "The Library Journal." The school library is 
of course not to be confused with the branch estab- 
lished in the school building as an offshoot of the 
main library. Each has its uses and its reason of 
being, though the control and direction of library 
activity by the library authorities rather than by the 
school board would seem in general to yield the bet- 
ter results. New York State long ago tried the 
system of district school libraries, and was glad to 
discard it in favor of a more economical and fruitful 
plan. But unquestionably the school library has 
often proved itself far better than no library at all, 
and has often, especially in our Southern States, pre- 
pared the way for a full-fledged public library. In 
this connection it is to be noted that some few local 
attempts, as at Minneapolis and in New York City, 
have been made to put the public library system 
under the control of the school authorities as a part 
of the general educational system. Probably most 
if not all library workers will maintain, and with 
reason, that the public library is too distinctive and 
important an institution to be made a subordinate 
part of any general system, even though a cordial 



cooperation of school and library is always desirable 
and is more and more becoming the rule rather than 
the exception. Those interested in this whole ques- 
tion of affiliating the two will do well to read, if 
they have not already done so, those numbers of 
Mr. Dana's "Modern American Library Economy 
Series " that treat of school work in the library and 
library work in the school, and also the various 
papers and editorials on the subject in the "School 
Number" (April) of "The Library Journal." 



How THE AMERICAN PUBLIC LIBRARY STRIKES 
AN IMMIGRANT, or at least how it struck one immi- 
grant from Russia eager to enjoy the blessings of 
American citizenship, may be gathered from a 
passage in the penultimate chapter of Miss Mary 
Antin's autobiography, parts of which have been 
appearing in the "Atlantic" as a preliminary to its 
recent publication in book form under the title of 
"The Promised Land." Of the book-hungry little 
alien we read in her own glowing words : " Off 
toward the northwest, in the direction of Harvard 
Bridge, which some day I should cross on my way 
to Radcliffe College, was one of my favorite palaces, 
whither I resorted every day after school. A low, 
wide-spreading building with a dignified granite front 
it was, flanked on all sides by noble old churches, 
museums, and schoolhouses, harmoniously disposed 
around a spacious triangle called Copley Square. 
Two thoroughfares that came straight from the 
green suburbs swept by my palace, one on either 
side, converged at the apex of the triangle, and 
pointed off, across the Public Garden, across the 
historic Common, to the domed State House sitting 
on a height. It was my habit to go very slowly up 
the broad steps to the palace entrance, pleasing my 
eyes with the majestic lines of the building, and 
lingering to read again the carved inscriptions : 
Public Library Built by the People Free to 
All. . . . Here is where I liked to remind myself 
of Polotzk, the better to bring out the wonder of 
my life. That I who was born in the prison of the 
Pale should roam at will in the land of freedom, 
was a marvel that it did me good to realize. That 
I who was brought up to my teens almost without 
a book should be set down in the midst of all the 
books that ever were written, was a miracle as great 
as any on record. That an outcast should become 
a privileged citizen, that a beggar should dwell in a 
palace this was a romance more thrilling than poet 
ever sung. Surely I was rocked in an enchanted 
cradle." Even the world-weary and the blase will 
catch something of the enthusiasm, of the exultant 
joy of living, that breathe in every page of "The 
Promised Land." ... 

EDUCATIONAL CHAOS, from which it is hoped that 
something like educational kosmos is now beginning 
to emerge in this country, forms the subject of some 
interesting observations and suggestions from Dr. 
Henry S. Pritchett in an article entitled "Education 
and the Nation" in the April "Atlantic Monthly." 
Like many another before him, Dr. Pritchett deplores 



THE DIAJL 



[May 1, 



the lack of unity and system in American education. 
a lack far more conspicuous than in the other great 
nations of the world ; and this defect becomes more 
pronounced the higher we go in our seminaries of 
learning. Even our largest universities have a dis- 
tinctly local or provincial character, and pursue their 
course with too little regard to any one common ideal 
and aim. But of late years a hopeful coordination 
of college and university with the high school has 
been effected, and this seems likely to lead to a better 
unification of higher education itself throughout the 
country. A valuable contributing agency to this end 
should be found in our national bureau of education, 
which has hitherto concerned itself almost exclusively 
with the elementary and secondary schools, but which, 
under its new head, Dr. Pritchett hopes may advance 
to larger undertakings. " Every state system of edu- 
cation," he believes, "every college, every university 
which is doing honest and sincere work, has every- 
thing to hope and nothing to fear from such a na- 
tional scrutinizing agency. No one can doubt that 
the influence of a bureau so administered would make 
not only for educational efficiency, but for a larger 
patriotism. The college which best serves the nation 
will in the long run serve best its state and its com- 
munity." Standardization can be carried to regret- 
table extremes, in education as elsewhere ; but there 
is no immediate danger of any tame and tiresome 
monotony in our widely scattered and abundantly 
diversified institutions of higher learning. 


THE HIGH SCHOOL AND THE PUBLIC LIBRARY 

seem in general admirably fitted to work together 
in harmony and for the common good. Yet there 
is sometimes a remarkable lack of hearty and intel- 
ligent cooperation in their activities. Mr. Thomas 
Lloyd- Jones, principal of the Madison ( Wis.) High 
School, calls attention, in the current " Wisconsin 
Library Bulletin," to a striking instance of this lack. 
He says, in part: -In the high school building [at 
Madison] no provision had been made for a library 
room because the public library was supposed to 
adequately minister to our needs. There was no one 
person whose duty it was to see that these hundreds 
of young people were encouraged in their quest for 
knowledge not absolutely required by the teachers. 
Many good books and magazines were in the public 
library spoiling from lack of use. As a rule, the 
high school teachers did not use the facilities at 
hand. Teachers would send pupils to the library 
for reference work without knowing that the desired 
information was available. . . . This unscientific, 
haphazard, inefficient method produced dissatisfac- 
tion on the part of pupils, overwrought nerves on 
the part of librarians, and the blues on the part of 
the teacher, who was disappointed again and again 
because pupils came to class with poorly prepared 
lessons." How this vexatious situation was changed 
for the better is explained in the latter part of Mr. 
Lloyd- Jones's interesting article, his own agency in 
the transformation being notunapparent though mod- 
estly kept in the background. Other matter of inter- 



est to teachers as well as to librarians is to be found 
in the same issue of the "Bulletin." 



Kt iciriDK.s AM> MK. HKKNAKH SHAW were rival 
candidates for popular favor, some yearn ago, on the 
London stage. The distinguished Grecian, Professor 
Gilbert Murray, who is now visiting us, had a word 
of interest to say to the inevitable and ineluctable 
interviewer when the latter asked him about the 
production of his translations from the Greek tragic 
poets. "There was an unexpected interest in them," 
he replied. ''And the crowds were in the pit," he 
added, with manifest satisfaction. "You know, 
Bernard Shaw and Euripides were alternating then 
in Mr. Barker's theatre, and as to receipts were run- 
ning neck and neck; but I think I rather beat him 
in the pit." Among other remarks attributed to the 
interviewed scholar at this time, it is encouraging 
to read this: "Greek is forging ahead in England. 
Compulsory Greek is, of course, dying out in most 
places, though it will probably always be kept for a 
good many of the courses at Oxford and Cambridge. 
But the general interest in Greek thought and Greek 
literature has increased enormously during the last 
fifteen years or so. ... And there 's another inter- 
esting thing. I believe there's no country in the 
world where the political leaders are such scholars 
as they are in England. Take Mr. Asquith. He's 
a first-rate Greek scholar, and two of his sons are. 
Mr. Birrell is another, and Lord Milner and Lord 
Morley." Dr. Murray goes so far as to maintain that 
"the number of people who can translate a piece of 
Greek is larger than ever," and he eloquently and 
well explains why the love of Greek should continue 
and will continue. Cheering words are these of Dr. 
Murray's, even after all allowance for enthusiasm 
has been made. ... 

THE AVERAGE READER is the subject of a recent 
bright and entertaining contribution to ''Harper's 
Weekly" from the pen of Miss Olivia Howard I)un- 
bar ; but the average reader, if anyone can be found 
to acknowledge himself such, may well fail to recog- 
nize his portrait in the flattering picture drawn by 
Miss Dunbar. "His desires," affirms the writer, 
"are mainly three: first, to know what life is, which 
leads him to read science; second, to know what 
life means, which takes him to religion and philo- 
sophy; and third, to know how life may be intensi- 
fied, wherefore he reads romance." Surely, this is, 
in part, at least, what the average reader ought, for 
his own good, to read ; and it is what public libraries 
gently and unobtrusively encourage him to read; 
but if the whole number of books on science and 
philosophy and religion read in a year were divided 
by the number of readers of that year, it is safe to 
assert that no more than a small fraction of a book 
in those serious classes would stand to the credit of 
each reader. In this calculation both sexes are to 
be included, and every person whose indulgence in 
reading is not confined to the newspaper. Any con- 
siderable experience in public library work or in 
miscellaneous bookselling must compel the candid

person to admit, however reluctantly, that science 
and philosophy and religion do not constitute two- 
thirds or even one-third of the reading matter de- 
manded by fifty out of every hundred readers, or, 
in other words, by the average reader. 

INDIVIDUALISM IN EDUCATION has been the ten" 
dency ever since " the three R's " ceased to be the un" 
varying curriculum of the schools, and Greek, Latin, 
and mathematics the sum and substance of a college 
training. The ramifications and reticulations of a 
complicated elective system, with its attempted pro- 
vision for all conceivable tastes and bents on the col- 
lege student's part, the modern schemes of university 
extension, and the various vocational and industrial 
schools, schools for backward pupils, schools for ex- 
ceptionally forward pupils, institutions for the blind, 
the deaf, the deaf-and-dumb, for the weak-minded, 
and so on, are certainly calculated to meet the wants 
of the individual in a manner undreamt-of in the days 
when the little red schoolhouse, the village academy, 
and the college were the only known agencies for 
teaching the young idea and rounding out the accom- 
plishments of the adolescent youth and the budding 
maiden. In no fewer than fifty-four of our cities 
there are now reported to be special schools or school- 
rooms for those brighter or more precocious children 
who in the olden time were compelled to fret their 
hearts out in checking their eager pace to something 
like the slowness of the leaden-footed and wooden- 
headed tail-enders of the class. The stereotyping or 
standardizing of education is apparently something 
one need not lie awake nights to worry over just 
at present. ... 

WILLIAM T. STEAD, man of ideas and ideals, 
militant champion of the cause of peace, confident 
advocate of a wonderful scheme for inoculating bar- 
ren soil with the bacillus of fertility, philanthropic 
propounder of a plan for providing homes for unfor- 
tunate infants, ardent enthusiast for psychic research, 
and incidentally a writer of books and founder of 
"The Review of Reviews" and other less successful 
periodical publications, was among the victims of the 
late awful shipwreck off Cape Race. Among the 
many works of his pen are " Truths about the Navy," 
" Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon," for which he 
suffered three months' imprisonment, "The Truth 
about Russia," " If Christ Came to Chicago," " Satan's 
Invisible World," "The United States of Europe," 
"Mr. Carnegie's Conundrum," and "The Despised 
Sex." Born in 1849, the son of a dissenting min- 
ister, Mr. Stead came honestly by his bent for non- 
conformity, and it is cause for deep regret that so 
vigorous a protestant against all manner of intrenched 
iniquity and hoary prejudice should have been cut 
off in the ripeness of his powers. 

BRET HABTE AND DICKENS AS ESTIMATED AND 
COMPARED BY CARLYLE, in a letter of Carlyle's 
dated 1872, that someone has unearthed and made 
public, seem to stand very nearly on the same dead 
level of mediocrity. "Bret Harte," says the letter, 



" is a notable kind of object, a man altogether mod- 
elled upon Dickens ; like Dickens seeking his heroes 
in the region of blackguardism and the gutters, where 
heroic magnanimities and benevolences, I believe, 
were never found; and delineating them, like him, 
by ell-deep mimicry instead of penetration to the 
real root of them and their affairs which indeed 
lies much further down ! Like Dickens, however, he 
does the feat generally well ; and I suppose will con- 
tinue at the same moderate workmanship, though a 
man of more weight of metal than Dickens was." 
Carlyle goes on to despair of Bret Harte's mending 
his ways, his forty years counting too heavily against 
any such reform. But to be reckoned as possessing 
"more weight of metal" than the foremost novelist 
of his time is surely glory enough, and Bret Harte 
might well have been content to keep on with his 
"ell-deep mimicry," wherein few have surpassed 
him. 

BROWNING'S TACT AND COURTESY shone conspic- 
uous as the poet moved, a prominent figure, in the 
social and literary world of his day. In Hon. George 
W. E. Russell's latest volume of personal recollec- 
tions, " One Look Back," an anecdote is told showing 
how the adroit author of "Asolando" could relieve 
himself of a bore with the air of conferring a favor. 
Mr. Russell had assembled a group of Browning 
enthusiasts to meet the master at a dinner which he, 
the narrator, was giving in the poet's honor. "As 
soon as dinner was over," he says, "one of these en- 
thusiasts led the great man into a corner and began 
cross-examining him about the identity of 'The 
Lost Leader' and the meaning of 'Sordello.' For a 
space Browning bore the catechism with admirable 
patience ; and then, laying his hand on the question- 
er's shoulder, he exclaimed : ' But, my dear fellow, 
this is too bad ; I am monopolizing you ! ' and skipped 
out of the corner." The not infrequent disinclination 
of writers, as of other craftsmen, to talk shop, is a 

thing the literary-hero-worshipper is slow to learn. 

. 

JOURNALISM AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS 
is assuming large proportions, both as an academic 
course and as a practical industry. The new build- 
ing now in process of construction for the School 
of Commerce will furnish commodious quarters for 
the work in journalism, whose magnitude and im- 
portance in the university life may be inferred from 
the many publications issued by the students. These 
include "The Daily Illini," "The Illinois Maga- 
zine," "The Illinois Agriculturist," "The Illio," 
"The Technograph," and the humorous monthly 
magazine, "The Siren." The young men in training 
at Urbana for the regeneration of the nation's news- 
papers maintain a fraternity which appropriately 
calls itself "The Fourth Estate."

COMMUNICA TION. 

CAVOUR AND A FAMOUS PHRASE. 
(To the Editor of THK DIAL.) 

In his interesting letter in THK DIAL of April 1, on 
"D'Annunzio as a National Poet," Mr. Melville B. 
Anderson falls into the common error of attributing to 
Cavour the historic expression "L'ltalia fara da se," 
and then piles Ossa on Pelion by interpreting the phrase 
as a prophecy that United Italy " will not exist ... by 
the sufferance of her neighbors " or, to put it more 
forcibly, that she would exist without need of this snffer- 
ance. Now, it is hardly fair to Cavour to burden him 
with the authorship of so unthinking a boast or so ab- 
surd a prophecy. The plan by which Italy, alone and 
unaided, was to realize independence and unity broke 
down utterly in 1848-9, with the failure of Piedmont to 
expel the Austrians; and when Cavour came to power 
in November, 1852, he brought into office the convic- 
tion that only with the assistance of a foreign state 
could the independence of Italy be won. This convic- 
tion was the very basis of his policy; and, acting upon 
it, he gained the indispensable aid of Napoleon III. Only 
a superficial knowledge of the times is necessary to make 
it clear that Cavour would not, indeed could not, have 
voiced this bit of patriotic bombast. 

The author of the phrase was the king, Charles Albert. 
In 1843, there had been a dispute between Piedmont 
and Austria over the salt trade with the Canton of 
Ticino. There had been further friction as to the Treaty 
of Florence; and in April, 1846, Austria placed a pro- 
hibitive tariff on Piedmontese wines. The attempt to 
cow Piedmont failed. To quote Mr. Bolton King, 
"Charles Albert . . . told his reactionary councillors 
that if Piedmont lost Austria she would gain Italy, and 
then Italy would be able to act for herself. ' " (History of 
Italian Unity, vol. i, pp. 167-8. The italics are mine.) 

Again, in his proclamation of March 23, 1848, to the 
people of Lombardy and Venetia, the king said that 
Piedmont was "trusting in the aid of that God who 
. . . enables Italy to work out her own salvation " 
(pose 1' Italia in grado di fare da se). Mr. W. R. Thayer 
points out in his " Dawn of Italian Independence " 
(vol. ii, p. 131, Note), that the expression " L' Italia 
fara da se," which the proclamation echoes, originated 
in the disputes with Austria; it is probable that its 
repetition by the king in this manifesto gave it wider 
currency and made it the battle-cry of his unsuccessful 
campaigns. As Mr. Thayei- says, it " was the national 
watchword until the disaster of 1848-9 proved it to be 
fallacious." Cavour, as a statesman, inherited the les- 
son, as well as the hope, which lay in the king's noble 
failure. FREDERICK ALDRICR CLKVU.ANP.

Something new and distinctive marks the 
style of the young Russian Jewess whose recent 
contributions to "The Atlantic Monthly," over 
the signature "Mary Antin," have attracted 
more than usual attention. The abbreviated 
and simplified form of her Russian patronymic. 
adopted by the immigrant family after consult- 
ation with a self-constituted committee for the 
Americanization of impossible foreign names, is 
no longer that by which the gifted writer is 
known among her friends, since she is now the 
wife of a Columbia University professor ; but 
to her admiring readers she will continue to be 
Mary Antin, and thus the reviewer will call her. 
" The Promised Land," now published complete, 
in book form, after the appearance of the greater 
part in the above-named magazine, is the life- 
story of an eager, observant, reflective, aspiring, 
and always original young woman whose fun na- 
tive years have been divided between the stifling 
restrictions of the "Pale " and the glorious free- 
dom of America. Polotzk, in the government of 
Vitebsk, was the scene of her infancy and early 
childhood ; Boston and its suburbs that of her 
maidenhood and young womanhood with the 
broad Atlantic separating as by a chasm none 
too wide the amazingly disparate halves of this 
growing period. She is still under thirty, and she 
had to learn our language at an age when the ac- 
quisition of a new tongue is not exactly like the 
imbibing of mother's milk ; and yet note the idio- 
matic raciness of her style as illustrated by the 
following random passage out of her book : 

" Grandma Rachael meant to be very strict with us 
children, and accordingly was prompt to disclipme us; 
but we discovered early in our acquaintance with her 
that the child who got a spanking was sure to get a hot 
cookie or the jam pot to lick, so we did not stand in 
great awe of her punishments. Even if it came to a 
spanking it was only a farce. Grandma generally inter- 
posed a pillow between the palm of her hand and the 
area of moral stimulation." 

The Polotzk of the narrative is, of course, not 
to be confused with Plotzk (also written Plock) 
of Russian Poland, some four hundred miles to 
the southwest ; nor is the Dvina River that flows 
within a few miles of Polotzk to be mistaken for 
the mighty Dwina that empties into the White 
Sea. Having thus definitely fixed the scene of 
Mary An tin's first years of wide-eyed wonder

and intellectual hunger, let us hear her relate 
the cruel disappointment of her infant hopes to 
be allowed to drink at the fountain of knowledge 
even as the boys drank. Word had gone abroad 
that Pinchus, son-in-law of Raphael the Russian, 
had two bright little girls whose talents were 
going to waste for lack of training, and Rabbi 
Lozhe became interested and sent for them, to 
see what truth there might be in the report. 

" They tell me how the rav lifted me up on a table 
iu front of him, and asked me many questions, and en- 
couraged me to ask questions in my turn. Reb' Lozhe 
came to the conclusion, as a result of this interview, that 
I ought by all means to be put to school. There was 
no public school for girls, as we know, but a few pupils 
were maintained in a certain private school by irregular 
contributions from city funds. Reb' Lozhe enlisted in 
my cause the influence of his son, who, by virttie of some 
municipal office which he held, had a vote in fixing this 
appropriation. But although he pleaded eloquently for 
my admission as a city pupil, the rav's son failed to win 
the consent of his colleagues, and my little crack of 
opportunity was tightly stopped." 

The bitter lot of the Russian Jew is depicted 
by the author in a way to wring the heart, but 
the gloom and horror of it all are relieved by 
irresistible touches of humor, while the charity 
and largeness of view displayed by this daughter 
of a hated and ill-used race are beyond praise. 
A paragraph or two from the opening chapter, 
" Within the Pale," will present a picture of 
hardship, cruelty, and injustice strikingly in 
contrast with the large opportunity and blessed 
freedom beckoning the poor victims to the land 
of promise across the seas. 

" Many bitter sayings came to your ears if you were 
a Jewish little girl in Polotzk. ' It is a false world,' 
you heard, and you knew it was so, looking at the Czar's 
portrait, and at the flags. ' Never tell a police officer 
the truth,' was another saying, and you knew it was good 
advice. ... It was not easy to live, with such bitter 
competition as the congestion of population made inevit- 
able. ^ There were ten times as many stores as there 
should have been, ten times as many tailors, cobblers, 
barbers, tinsmiths. A Gentile, if he failed in Polotzk, 
could go elsewhere, where there was less competition. 
A Jew could make the circle of the Pale, only to find 
the same conditions as at home. Outside the Pale he 
could only go to certain designated localities, on pay- 
ment of prohibitive fees, augmented by a constant stream 
of bribes; and even then he lived at the mercy of the 
local chief of police. ... It was easier to be friends 
with the beasts in the barn than with some of the Gen- 
tiles. The cow and the goat and the cat responded to 
kindness, and remembered which of the housemaids was 
generous and which was cross. The Gentiles made no 
distinctions. A Jew was a Jew, to be hated and spat 
upon and used spitefully." 

Turning now to America and emancipation 
and limitless opportunity, with hope new every 
morning and attaining its sure fulfilment with 
each passing week and month and year, we find 



the wonder and delight of the young immigrant 
thus portrayed: 

" Education was free. That subject my father had 
written about repeatedly, as comprising his chief hope 
for us children, the essence of American opportunity, 
the treasure that no thief could touch, not even misfor- 
tune or poverty. It was the one thing he was able to 
promise us when he sent for us ; surer, safer than bread 
or shelter. On our second day I was thrilled with the 
realization of what this freedom of education meant. A 
little girl from across the alley came and offered to 
conduct us to school. . . . No application made, no 
questions asked, no examinations, rulings, exclusions; 
no machinations, no fees. The doors stood open for 
every one of us. The smallest child could show us 
the way." 

Again, in a later chapter, this emphasis on the 
educational advantages enjoyed by the children 
of new-comers to our free land is repeated. Far 
too few are the immigrant foreigners who are 
thus dazzled by the brightness of intellectual 
and spiritual opportunities, rather than by the 
gleam of gold, luring them to the land of prom- 
ise. But it is cheering to find even one of them 
writing in the following strain : 

" The public school has done its best for us foreigners, 
and for the country, when it has made us into good 
Americans. I am glad it is mine to tell how the miracle 
was wrought in one case. You should be glad to hear 
of it, you born Americans; for it is the story of the 
growth of your country ; of the flocking of your brothers 
and sisters from the far ends of the earth to the flag 
you love ; of the recruiting of your armies of workers, 
thinkers, and leaders. And you will be glad to hear of 
it, my comrades in adoption; for it is a rehearsal of 
your own experience, the thrill and wonder of which 
your own hearts have felt." 

Not even the depressing atmosphere of Bos- 
ton's slums could lower the high spirits of little 
Mary Antin. She held a draft on the bank of 
good fortune and was on her way to the paying- 
teller's window to have it cashed. "My days 
in the slums," she says, " were pregnant with 
possibilities; it only needed the ripeness of 
events to make them bring forth fruit in reali- 
ties. Steadily as I worked to win America, 
America advanced to lie at my feet. I was an 
heir, on Dover Street, awaiting maturity. I 
was a princess waiting to be led to the throne." 
A few details in regard to Dover Street, which 
all unconsciously was housing this royal person- 
age in disguise, may be of interest here. The 
migration to that unlovely thoroughfare, after a 
number of similar movings from one scene of 
squalid poverty to another, is thus referred to : 

" What happened next was Dover Street. And what 
was Dover Street? And rather, what was it not? Dover 
Street was my fairest garden of girlhood, a gate of para- 
dise, a window facing on a broad avenue of life. Dover 
Street was a prison, a school of discipline, a battlefield 
of sordid strife. The air in Dover Street was heavy

with evil odors of degradation, but a breath from the 
uppermost heavens, rippled through, whispering of infi- 
nite things. In Dover Street the dragon poverty gripped 
me for a last fight, but I overthrew the hideous creature. 
and sat on his neck as on a throne. In Dover Street I 
was shackled with a hundred chains of disadvantage, 
but with one free hand I planted little seeds, right there 
in the mud of shame, that blossomed into the honeyed 
rose of widest freedom. In Dover Street there was often 
no loaf on the table, but the hand of some noble friend 
was ever in mine. The night in Dover Street was rent 
with the cries of wrong, but the thunders of truth 
crashed through the pitiful clamor and died out in 
prophetic silences." 

That the writer of the foregoing is a poet will 
be plain to the appreciative reader. The story 
of her early essays in verse, of her first appear- 
ance in print as the veritable author of some real 
poetry, rhymed and divided into stanzas, and 
every line beginning with a capital, and of her 
father's emptying his till in the purchase of 
copies of the daily paper containing the wonder- 
ful poem, forms one of the most enlivening 
chapters of the book. Poetry was expected to 
be the key unlocking the treasure-chamber that 
should enrich and make forever happy the entire 
Antin family ; and what reader of this fairy tale 
from real life shall say that it was not poetry that 
in the end wrought deliverance from poverty and 
opened the way to a larger and richer and more 
soul-satisfying existence? One further quota- 
tion, from the book's closing chapter, must find 
space for itself. 

And is this really to be the hut word ? Yes, though 
a long chapter of the romance of Dover Street is left 
untold. I could fill another book with anecdotes, telling 
how I took possession of Beacon Street, and learned to 
distinguish the lord of the manor from the butler in 
full dress. I might trace my steps from my bare room 
overlooking the lumber-yard to the satin drawing-rooms 
of the Back Bay, where I drank afternoon tea with gentle 
ladies whose hands were as delicate as their porcelain 
cups. My journal of those days is full of comments on 
the contrasts of life, that I copied from my busy thoughts 
in the evening, after a visit to my aristocratic friends. 
Coming straight from the cushioned refinement of Beacon 
Street, where the maid who brought my hostess her 
slippers spoke in softer accents than the finest people in 
Dover Street, I sometimes stumbled over poor Mr. Casey 
lying asleep in the corridor; and the shock of the con- 
trast was like a searchlight turned suddenly on my life, 
and I pondered over the revelation, and wrote touching 
poems, in which I figured as a heroine of two worlds." 

No want of confidence in her powers and her 
destiny seems ever to have brought despondency 
to this high-hearted young woman ; and the con- 
tagion of her belief in herself was caught by 
others. Dr. Edward Everett Hale became in- 
terested in her, and many were the happy half- 
hours she spent with him or with members of 
his family in the old Roxbury homestead. Bar- 
nard College gave her the higher education 



she felt herself predestined to obtain, though 
KadclitTf, arross tin- Charles, had In-fii tin- ilivain 
of her Dover Street girlhood. The Boston Pub- 
lic Library became her palace of delight as soon 
as she got her bearings in the splendid . \MHT- 
ican city, and some of her pages glow with ad- 
miring praise of that abode of the muses. The 
infectious optimism and high courage of the 
book, as well as the vigor and picturesqueness 
of its style, with its frequent touches of humor. 
gleams of mirth, and suggestions of poetry, win 
the reader at the outset and hold him enthralled 
to the final page. Illustrations from photographs 
help one to follow the course of the writer from 
poverty-stricken Polotzk to the wonders and the 
riches of Beacon Street and Copley Squai : and 
a glossary of Yiddish and other alien terms used 
in the book follows the narrative.

INTERPRETING AMKHK AN LITEHATIKK 
FOR THE GERMANS.* 

It is indisputable that the greatest work to be 
accomplished to-day, by scholars and students of 
literature from the international point of view, 
is the task of inaugurating a more vital relation 
of mutual comprehension, enlightenment, and 
sympathy between the different countries of the 
world. One of the most potent of instrumen- 
talities for razing the barriers of international 
hostility and dispelling prevailing ignorance 
and misunderstanding, is the free mutual inter- 
change of national interpretation. Familiarity 
by the citizens of one country with the work of 
the great artists of another country whether 
litterateur, painter, sculptor, or musician 
and reverence for their art, are factors of incal- 
culable value in the promotion of international 
comity. A brilliant critic of an earlier day once 
said that it was inconceivable that England 
should wage war upon a nation which had pro- 
duced such incomparable artists as Moliere and 
Renan. " I have often said, when asked to state 
the case against the fools and money-changers 
who are trying to drive us [England] into a war 
with Germany, ''recently remarked an astute stu- 
dent of Welt-Politik, "that the case consists of 
the single word, Beethoven. To-day, I should 
say with equal confidence, Strauss." Under the 
/"/ime of peace, the task of national interpre- 
tation and the analysis of the origin and causes

of variations and clashes of racial opinion, 
whether in politics or literature, is a task which 
liberates that irresistible passion for social en- 
lightenment now permeating the entire civilized 
world. 

The system of international exchange of 
professors inaugurated some years ago between 
this and other countries, notably France and 
Germany, has already produced momentous 
results, in projecting for foreign contemplation 
a more rational perspective for American life, 
literature, and ideals, and correcting many mis- 
apprehensions arising from the more or less con- 
ventional and superficial impressions recorded 
by foreign observers. One of the most sug- 
gestive, and certainly the most broadly based 
and closely integrated, of all the interpretative 
projections of American nationalism, as em- 
bodied in her literature, which have yet appeared 
is the volume of lectures on American Litera- 
ture, by Dr. C. Alphonso Smith, Roosevelt 
Exchange Professor at the University of Berlin 
(1910-1911), and Edgar Allan Poe Professor 
of English Literature at the University of Vir- 
ginia. 

Scholarship alone, though an indispensable 
requisite, is inadequate equipment for the inter- 
pretation of American national temperament 
and genius. To scholarship must be superadded 
a full-blooded national spirit, a comprehensive 
knowledge of American life, and the talent for 
expressing sympathetic intuition with clarity, 
force, and the sort of inspired conviction which 
induces conviction in the foreign auditor. This 
rare union of qualities, indispensable for the 
highest effectiveness, has not always been found 
in the American representative. It is this very 
union of qualities in the person of Dr. Smith 
which gave him his distinction as an academic 
ambassador at Berlin, and which, as expressed 
in the volume under consideration, constitutes it 
the most important interpretation of American 
literature from the international point of view 
thus far contributed by American criticism. 

In executing his delicate and complex task, 
it is clear that the author has been animated by 
two shaping principles the one a principle of 
interpretation, the other a principle of method. 
His primary purpose was to write, not a con- 
secutive and exhaustive history of American lit- 
erature a task manifestly precluded by the 
character and scope of the lectures, but an 
interpretation of American national life, ideals, 
and genius as bodied forth in our literature. 
His secondary purpose was, not only to exhibit 
American literature as an expression of Ameri- 



can temperament, but also to show the cultural 
interactions between the literature of America, 
and European in particular, German liter- 
ature. The successful accomplishment of his 
primary purpose is effected through the mainte- 
nance of a broad nationalism in his interpreta- 
tions, the exclusion of all sectional controversy, 
and the appreciation of the cardinal figures and 
dominant movements in our literature as expres- 
sions of national, rather than of provincial, of 
international rather than of insular, conscious- 
ness. Even when his interpretation might ap- 
pear to reflect bias or predilection, its sincere 
forthrightness argues in the author concern for 
the fundamental principles of literature and 
never any trace of sectional prejudice or pre- 
possession. The accomplishment of his second- 
ary purpose, if less successful, is effected by 
liberal quotation of the best foreign, especially 
German, interpretations of American life and 
literature, and a constant indication of the 
streams of cultural influence flowing between 
America and Europe throughout the history of 
American literature. 

It should be pointed out that the purpose of 
the book is to inspire in the German public a 
vital interest in America and her literature. In 
devoting himself to this purpose, the author has 
integrated his materials in a masterly way. 
Translation of the book into English would, how- 
ever, show that Dr. Smith wrote his lectures 
primarily for a German audience, and in so doing 
deliberately employed the compact and synthetic 
methods of German scholarship methods not 
always wholly congenial to the American tem- 
perament. 

This survey of Dr. Smith's, by reason of its 
enforced scope and aim, lacks the superficial 
unity and chronological sequence of the conven- 
tional catalogue of American literature. The 
problem of selecting the figures, movements, and 
streams of cultural influence which bulk largest 
in our literature, was a problem of great deli- 
cacy and tact. It must be said that, in this re- 
spect, Dr. Smith has exhibited both liberality 
of view and discrimination in judgment. 

In the first place, there is an examination of 
certain individual figures, which are generally 
acknowledged to be summits in our literature 
Franklin, Jefferson, Irving, Cooper, Emerson, 
Longfellow, and Whitman. The inclusion of 
Jefferson in a list that excludes Hawthorne and 
Lanier is doubly explained : first, on the ground 
that Jefferson, though not a distinctively liter- 
ary figure, definitely pointed the way to the in- 
dividualism and the idealism which constitute 



862 



THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



the leading factors in American literature ; and 
second, because to Hawthorne, and to Lanier in 
lesser degree, is devoted particular consideration 
in the surveys of the American short-story and 
of American idealism. 

In the second place, the author has studied 
other dominant figures in connection with dis- 
tinct contributions of America to world-literature 
Poe as the incarnation of the structural and 
technical genius of America; Mark Twain as the 
embodiment of American humor ; Joel Chand- 
ler Harris in vindication of his pre-eminence 
in utilizing the negro as literary material ; and 
Cooper, in the chapter above mentioned, prim- 
arily for his achievement in bodying forth the 
romance and the sociological tragedy of the In- 
dian, the primitive man in contrast with our 
highly institutionalized civilization. 

In the third place, the author has studied cer- 
tain signal aspects and phases of our literature, 
surveying that literature in retrospect at differ- 
ent periods in its history, and throwing into 
sharp outline those unquestioned contributions to 
world-literature in which America has won inter- 
national acknowledgement. This philosophical 
treatment, which gives the book its warrant to 
be ranked as distinctly Kulturgeschichte^ re- 
veals itself in the Introduction and the Gen- 
eral Survey "; in the chapter, " American Poetry 
up to the Year 1832," " Idealism in American 
Literature," " The Influence of Transcendental- 
ism upon American Literature," " The Ameri- 
can Short-Story "; and the continual advertence 
to individualism as the force hitherto dominant 
in American literature and in American life. 

Every informed reader will doubtless disagree 
with Dr. Smith in his deliberate " sins of omis- 
sion and commission," his individual preferences, 
exclusions, and inclusions, and his analysis of 
certain literary figures. Slight as is America's 
contribution in the field of the drama, at least it 
would seem entitled to a word in any treatment 
of American literature. The name of William 
James, a great stylist as well as a great philoso- 
pher, is missing from the index ; and the contri- 
butions of Mr. Howells to American fiction go 
unconsidered. Mention of the names and best 
work of Miss Ellen Glasgow and Miss Mary 
Johnston goes along with omission of the name of 
Mrs. Edith Wharton, the author of the greatest 
American novel of the last decade ("The House 
of Mirth"), and the name of Frank Norris, 
whose novel " The Pit " won world- wide recogni- 
tion. Citation of the conversations at the tomb 
of Adam and before the bust of Columbus, as 
being in Mark Twain's best vein and excelled 



by nothing he subsequently wrote, argues undue 
appreciation of the horse- play humor of the 
great humorist in his earlier period. The whole 
chapter, one of the best in the book, accentuat- 
ing Mark Twain's " humor with a purpose," his 
genius for effective contrast, especially social- 
political contrast, and his inherent idiosyncrasy 
for colossal exaggeration, nevertheless leaves in 
the main unstressed those deeper elements in his 
work of philosophical, ethical, and sociological 
import which imparted humanitarian character 
to the less boisterous productions of bis later 
period. The chapter on Walt Whitman, while 
largely devoted to recurrence to the fundamental 
principles of poetry, gives the effect of being both 
inadequate and one-sided throwing undue em- 
phasis upon the enumerative quality of Whit- 
man's production, and leaving unrevealed the 
colossal imaginative idealism of Whitman's spirit 
and his indubitably great faculty of interpreta- 
tion of literature in terms of democracy and 
human brotherhood. Omission, from both the 
index and the bibliography, of the names of 
Edward Carpenter, the greatest living apostle of 
Whitmanism, and of Horace Traubel, the high- 
est authority on Whitman, appears as an un- 
doubted defect. 

The most brilliant and original chapters in 
the book are those devoted to Poe and Harris. 
The treatment of Poe as a structural genius, who 
thereby revealed his fundamental Americanism 
as a national interpreter of our genius, is a re- 
freshing novelty after the long years of unin- 
spired rating of Poe as a declasse of literature, 
an artistic exotic. Brilliant and original as is 
the treatment, it is open to serious question 
whether Dr. Smith has validated his contention. 
I have shown elsewhere that, as structural ar- 
tists, Ibsen as a dramatist was the precise ana- 
logue of Poe as a short-shory writer. Each was 
that rarest of phenomena in literature, a compo- 
site of scientific worker and artistic thinker. If 
the scientific and structural genius of Poe argues 
his Americanism, by the same token may Ibsen, 
on the structural side, be rated as essentially 
representative of the American, not of the Dano- 
Norwegian-Germanic, genius. So little critical 
attention has hitherto been devoted to Harris 
that the enthusiastic tone of Dr. Smith's chap- 
ter may seem excessive to those not reared on 
the Uncle Remus folk-lore. In many respects, 
this chapter is the most suggestive in the book, 
calling attention, as it strongly does, to Harris's 
two-fold contribution to American literature: 
his masterly utilization of the negro as literary 
material, and the exceptional philological value 



1912.] 



THE DIAL 



353 



of that contribution. This chapter is the work 
of a true critic of literature and of a master 
philologist. Emerson is lauded as the rarest 
type of genius the symmetric, the harmonic 
genius ; and it was his supreme distinction to 
be an " idealist of idealists, an optimist of opti- 
mists." Longfellow is given full meed of praise 
for extending and deepening the sources of 
American culture, and widening the American 
horizon. Hawthorne is accorded unique emi- 
nence in our literature as an analyst of conscience 
and a supreme symbolist. New England litera- 
ture, judged by its masterpieces, is rated by Dr. 
Smith as " the highest and noblest expression 
which the American spirit has yet found "; but 
that does not blind the author of that phrase to 
the gently myopic absurdities of certain phases of 
Transcendentalism. The lectures most popular 
in Germany, according to my impression at the 
time, were, curiously enough, not those on Long- 
fellow, the missionary of German culture to 
America, or Emerson, reputed to be the most 
widely read author in Germany to-day, but those 
on Mark Twain, Edgar Allan Poe, Joel Chand- 
ler Harris, James Fenimore Cooper, and the 
American short-story. The final chapter in the 
volume, on the American short-story, though 
unmarked by any unusual originality, is the 
most compact and scholarly treatment ever de- 
voted to that fascinating phase of American 
literature. This lecture created a genuine stir 
in Berlin, led to the publication of the chapter 
in separate form, and was immediately followed 
by the appearance in German periodicals, in Ger- 
man translation, of a number of the short-stories 
of the North Carolina genius, the late " O. 
Henry." The bibliography, including titles of 
the most important books and magazine articles, 
both foreign and American, dealing with Amer- 
ican literature, is a most valuable adjunct to the 
text - ARCHIBALD HENDERSON. 



REMINISCENCES or A GREAT EDUCATOR.* 

There was sure to be something worth while 
in the reminiscences of one who has held as large 
a place in the educational and public life of the 
country as James Burrill Angell, late President 
of the University of Michigan. Under his guid- 
ance the school at Ann Arbor has had a tremen- 
dous influence on the educational development 
of the nation, and especially on the growth of 
the more recently founded State Universities, 
such as the magnificent institutions of Wiscon-

sin and Minnesota; and yet, while apparently 
wrapped up heart and soul in this great work, 
he at times broke away from his university 
duties to render signally effective service to the 
nation in its relations with other powers. Every 
time that a man of culture and refinement en- 
ters successfully and acceptably into the public 
service, and then drops back again quietly into 
his former walk in Jife, an added proof is given 
of the possibility of an efficient democracy. 

Dr. Angell's remotest American ancestor 
reached Massachusetts with Roger Williams in 
1631, and went with Williams five years later 
to the spot where the latter founded the city of 
Providence. Descendants of this Thomas Angell 
are numerous in Rhode Island, where most of the 
family have remained. " They have been found 
chiefly in the ranks of plain farmers, mechanics, 
and tradesmen, gaining by industry and integrity 
an honest living, but winning no particular dis- 
tinction. Living on a thoroughfare, the parents 
of President Angell combined tavern-keeping 
with farming, and the number of travellers en- 
tertained during his boyhood was considerable. 
The town meetings, too, were held at his father's 
tavern, together with occasional political meet- 
ings of a less official character, and now and then 
a justice's court. " I have always felt," he says, 
" that the knowledge of men I gained by the ob- 
servations and experiences of my boyhood in the 
country tavern has been of the greatest service. 
Human nature could be studied in every variety, 
from that of the common farm labourer to travel- 
ers of the highest breeding and refinement. . . . 
If , as I have sometimes been assured, I have any 
power of adaptation to the society of different 
classes of men, I owe it in no small degree to 
these varied associations of my boyhood." 

With the aid of an uncle, he picked up the 
alphabet from the capital initials at the heads 
of chapters of an old law book. At a very early 
age he was sent to a district school, learning to 
write with a goose-quill pen, in a copy-book made 
by his own hands and ruled with a leaden plum- 
met. Later he was placed in the private school 
of a Quaker, Isaac Fiske, to whose accuracy of 
instruction in arithmetic and surveying he ex- 
presses himself as under deep obligations. From 
this school he went for one term to a seminary 
at Seekonk, Massachusetts, and then to Smith- 
ville Seminary, a new school only five miles from 
his home, where under good classical instruction 
he "caught the swing and flow of the Virgilian 
verse, so that we read with genuine delight in 
the last six books of the ^Eneid at the rate of 
three hundred lines a day." His college educa-

tion was received at Brown University, where 
he studied under James R. Boise and Henry S. 
Frieze, both of whom preceded him at Ann Arbor 
and helped to lay the foundation of thoroughness 
which the Brown of the first half of the last 
century imparted to so many pioneer Western 
institutions. 

For some time after graduation he held a 
position of minor importance in the Brown li- 
brary, and in the autumn of the next year, 1850, 
set out on a horseback journey through the South, 
in company with his college classmate, Rowland 
Hazard, who made the trip in quest of relief for 
diseased lungs. After returning in the spring, 
he took up work with the City Engineer of Bos- 
ton, but in the following December he received 
from Mr. Hazard, who was again in trouble 
with his lungs, an urgent request to accompany 
him to southern Europe for the winter. Of a 
portion of this trip he says: 

The visit to Rome brought to me the first real reve- 
lation of the arts of sculpture and painting. The gal- 
leries and churches opened to me a new world. One 
cannot describe what it was to a person who had no con- 
ception of art except what he had derived from the sight 
of Powers' Greek Slave and copies in private houses of 
two or three classical masterpieces of painting, to have 
suddenly spread before him the immeasurable artistic 
wealth of Rome, with full liberty to gaze upon it at will, 
and to attain to some worthy appreciation of its wealth. 
Life could never again be quite what it was before. Of 
all the gifts of Rome to me, that was the greatest." 

Perhaps there is here some genetic relation to 
the fact that for a State University, where the 
materializing influences of the time are supposed 
to fall with especial weight, the institution at 
Ann Arbor has maintained exceptionally effec- 
tive departments of classical studies. In Vienna 
be received a letter from President Wayland, 
offering him his choice between the chair of Civil 
Engineering and that of Modern Languages in 
Brown University, with the privilege of remain- 
ing abroad a year and a half for study. He 
chose the latter, and after studying in Germany 
and France took up the duties of his professor- 
ship in 1853, at the age of twenty-four. Here 
he soon drifted into editorial work, with the 
Providence "Journal," and in 1860 resigned 
his university chair and took editorial charge of 
that paper, conducting it with vigor through the 
period of the Civil War. In 1866 he was called 
to the Presidency of the University of Vermont, 
and from there to the University of Michigan, 
in 1870. 

Such was the training for the great presiden- 
tial work at Ann Arbor, one of the prime fac- 
tors in the educational life of the nation for 
forty years. To these earlier years, Dr. Angell 



gives half of his book, while he assigns most of 
the other half to his various diplomatic servic. >. 
modestly leaving but thirty-four pages for his 
account of his work in the University of Mich- 
igan. For the facts of the forty years covered 
in this latter half, the reader must go to tin- 
book itself, where he will find the story one of 
great inherent interest and importance, and 
admirably told. W. H. JOHNSON. 



ROMAN KKLH;IOI - i:\ i-i.itn v< K.* 

Four books which have recently appeared 
make it possible for the British and American 
public not only to read in their own tongue the 
history and appreciation of ancient Roman reli- 
gious experience, but to read it with greater 
convenience and better understanding than has 
heretofore been possible in any single language. 
One is by the Oxford scholar, Mr. W . Warde 
Fowler, already widely known for " The Roman 
Festivals of the Period of the Republic," "Julius 
Caesar," " Social Life at Rome in the Age of 
Cicero," and " The City-State of the Greeks 
and Romans"; the second and third are "The 
Oriental Religions in Roman Paganism," and 
" Astrology and Religion among the Greeks and 
Romans," translated from the French of the 
brilliant Belgian scholar, Franz Cumont, of 
the University of Ghent, whose " Mysteries of 
Mithras" made him the acknowledged authority 
in this field; and the fourth is by Dr. Jesse 
Benedict Carter, Director of the American 
School of Classical Studies at Rome, author of 
"The Religion of Numa, and Other Essays on 
the Religion of Ancient Rome." 

Mr. Warde Fowler's book is a great satisfac- 
tion. The solidity o'f content, purity of style, 
symmetry of form, equipoise of temper, and 
gravity of purpose which we have learned to 
expect from the best British classical scholar- 
ship are all exemplified here in a high degree.

author's independence and originality prompt

him to write are of such urbanity that their 
charm of manner has no small part in the con- 
vincing quality of their content. With a few 
exceptions, among which may be mentioned one 
more addition to the already long list of none 
too successful attempts to give a satisfactory 
topographical setting to the rendering of Hor- 
ace's " Carmen Saeculare," and what seems a 
little too much insistence, in the fine chapter on 
Virgil, on the poet's conscious development of 
the character of .<3neas, there is nothing which 
savors of forcing. 

A comparison of Warde Fowler with Wis- 
sowa is inevitable, though the latter's usefulness 
is rather increased than diminished by the for- 
mer. The monumental German work is divis- 
ible into two parts: a highly concentrated 
historical sketch, and a series of minutely de- 
tailed accounts of individual deities and their cult 
organizations. The English work blends these 
two kinds of material into a single unified whole, 
with the effect of a narrative which is orderly, 
well knit, and appreciative to the highest degree. 
It is not a thesaurus, though its thorough appa- 
ratus of notes, appendices, and index make it a 
specialist's book as well as a work which will 
be illuminating to the average cultivated reader. 
The scope of the two books is not identical. Wis- 
sowa begins with the earliest period for which 
there is direct evidence ; Warde Fowler's book, 
as might be expected of a work coming from 
the land of anthropologists, begins with " The 
Threshold of Religion," two admirably self- 
restrained chapters in which survivals of taboo 
and magic are made the indirect evidence of the 
more remotely primitive religion. The German 
work closes with the death and disappearance 
of paganism in the sixth century; the English 
with the Augustan Reform and some well-chosen 
words on the legacy of paganism to the new order 
of religion. This is disappointing ; we miss an 
account of the movements of the Empire which 
helped make straight the way for Christianity. 

Fortunately, however, our regret at the loss 
of so agreeable a guide is tempered by the avail- 
ability of another work, now in English M. 
Franz Cumont's book on " The Oriental Relig- 
ions in Roman Paganism." In these most pene- 
trating studies we may find clearly traced the 
advent, development, influence, and final contri- 
bution to the Christian Church, of the deities 
from Egypt and Asia, chief among them the 
Magna Mater, Isis, and Mithras. The great 
merit of M. Cumont's work is the acuteness of 
vision with which he sees in a great array of evi- 
dence from widely scattered sources the founda- 



tions that underlay the success of these religions. 
The appearance of his book arouses all the more 
interest because of its author's recent lecture- 
tour to the principal cities and universities of 
the United States and Canada, where the charm 
of his personal qualities has increased the admi- 
ration already felt for his scholarship. The 
lectures of this tour have also recently issued 
from the press under the title of "Astrology 
and Religion among the Greeks and Romans." 
They were first delivered in this country under 
the auspices of the American Committee for 
Lectures on the History of Religions. Their 
contribution is the light they throw upon the 
relations between faith, superstition, and science 
in the astral worship of the Babylonians 
relations which kept astrology alive and power- 
ful for over a thousand years. 

The work of Director Carter differs from all 
four of those above mentioned in presenting no 
critical apparatus, and in aiming not so much at 
the communication of facts as the grounding of 
an impression the impression of the continuity 
and the cumulation of the Roman religious ex- 
perience. " What we are to do now," he says, 
"is to study not so much a religion in itself, 
but rather the effect of the impact of a specific 
religion upon the psychological consciousness of 
a people. Our interest is, therefore, not pri- 
marily in the content of the religion, but in the 
reaction which this content has called forth." 
The scope of the book may be indicated by these 
words from its concluding chapter : 

" During the millennium and a half, from the founda- 
tion of Rome until the death of Gregory the Great, we 
have observed the presence of two factors: a permanent 
religious need, and a permanent religious supply. . . . 
We have seen the great role which religion of necessity 
plays in human life." 

Mr. Carter's first chapters are the least suc- 
cessful partly because Roman paganism cannot 
in four chapters be satisfactorily presented even 
to a reader who is fairly well prepared to listen, 
and partly because he is hampered by already 
having written a book covering the period he 
treats in them. Beginning with the third chap- 
ter, in which Christianity enters into the story, 
the work finds the reader possessed of a more 
extensive background. Here the author's pur- 
pose leads him to sketch with rapid hand the his- 
tory of the times and of some of their great men. 
The figures of Constantine, Julian, Augustine, 
Benedict, and Gregory give this part a fine bio- 
graphical interest. The whole is written with 
a vigorous, direct, and unhesitating movement, 
which will put Mr. Carter's personal friends in 
mind of the old dictum that the style is the man.

The lover of justice will applaud the sane 
conclusion of all three of these scholars, that 
Roman religion was not the wholly dead and 
lifeless thing it is so often said to have been. 
They do not, indeed, credit paganism with the 
warmth of the Christian faith, but they do 
condemn though somewhat too conservatively 
the fashion which has prevailed of dismissing 
Roman religion as of a purely formal, contract- 
ual nature, having no relation to morality and 
no power to uplift. " That the formalized reli- 
gion of later times had become almost divorced 
from morality," says Mr. Warde Fowler, "there 
is indeed no doubt ; but in the earliest times, in 
the old Roman family and then in the budding 
State, the whole life of the Roman seems to me 
so inextricably bound up with his religion that 
I cannot possibly see how that religion can 
have been distinguishable from his simple idea 
of duty and discipline." In the life of the 
family, and especially in the unchanging rural 
Italy, he sees the same quality of religious life 
through all the centuries. Even the State reli- 
gion, in its most degenerate phase, he credits 
with having been in a state of suspended ani- 
mation rather than death, and looks upon its 
continued service after the Augustan Reform 
as proof of its vitality. 

M. Cumont reinforces him. The religions of 
the Empire, especially the Oriental faiths, were 
of still greater spiritual effect, rising as they did 
in an age of individual longing for salvation. 
" The religious and mystical spirit of the Orient," 
says M. Cumont's last sentence in the " Oriental 
Religions/' "had slowly overcome the whole 
social organism, and had prepared all nations 
to unite in the bosom of a universal church."

The newspapers and the magazines are devoting 
much space to the subject, and educational topics 
are found on the programmes of all sorts of associa- 
tions and clubs. As an outcome of this interest, one 
may hear and read extraordinary and contradictory 
statements regarding the value of any phase of 
present-day teaching. Some writers and speakers 
commend the tendencies in modern education, hut 
say we are not moving rapidly enough in the direction 
of making our school work from start to finish prac- 
tical, which means for them industrial and voca- 
tional; others say that we are drifting toward im i 
commercialism and materialism in the schools, car- 
ing no longer for genuine discipline and training, 
but only for something which will be of advantage 
in money-making. Partisans in either cam]) will 
do well to read Professor Graves 's new book, " Great 
Educators of Three Centuries," which should help 
the layman to understand contemporary educational 
aims and practices. The volume presents in a simple 
way some of the more important views of a number 
of classic writers on education. It is designed for 
those who are not familiar with the history of edu- 
cation, but who would be pleased to learn that many, 
if not all, of the ideals which educators are striving 
for to-day have been suggested by every student of 
education from Milton to our own times. Some of 
those who are complaining about present-day teach- 
ing have not the slightest notion of the origins of 
modern practice; and they permit themselves to be- 
come greatly worked up about the imaginary dangers 
ahead of us. Such persons are likely to do some 
harm, since they may cause the layman, who has no 
opportunity to trace the course of events in educa- 
tional practice, to fear that we are likely to go on il it- 
rocks unless we drop anchor or tack in an opposite 
direction. Professor Graves introduces the reader 
first to Milton : in about two thousand words he pre- 
sents and comments upon certain of Milton'> views 
on teaching as they relate to present-day movements. 
The theories and experiments of thirteen other t-iiu- 
cators, ending with Herbert Spencer, are treated in 
substantially the same way ; although more space is 
given to several who played a more important role 
in determining educational theory. The book is 
designed wholly for those persons who have not had 
previous study in the history of education, and who 
cannot be expected to go deeply into the philosophy 
of educational questions. A good bibliography is 
given at the close of each chapter, so that the reader 
may pursue any topic further if he chooses. 

It would be well if such writers as Dr. A. A. Berle 
could read a book like that of Professor Graves's 
before proceeding to instruct parents and teachers 
regarding the education of their children. Dr. Berle 
shows in his volume that he has a serious interest 
in education, and that he is eager to find the most 
economical and effective ways of training the young 
mi iid; but some of the methods he advocates have 
been condemned by every capable student of educa- 
tion from Milton to our own day. I n reading "The

School in the Home," one is constantly asking oneself 
whether Dr. Berle could be familiar with the views of 
Locke or Rousseau or Spencer. Some parts of his book 
are strikingly like Rousseau's "Emile." Rousseau 
thought that the young would be intellectually and 
morally maimed if they should be put under teachers 
before the beginning of their teens, and Dr. Berle 
appears to hold the same opinion. He is even more 
extreme in his condemnation of teachers and schools 
than was Rousseau. He says, for instance, (p. 56) : 
" Almost all the so-called horrors of the adolescent period 
show conclusively that the natural processes of childhood 
have become perverted by what we call ' education,' and the 
whole miserable muddle in which civilization finds itself on 
the sex question is almost directly due to this artificial and 
obfuscating interference, together with inability and ignor- 
ance in properly fertilizing the child mind on the significance 
of knowledge, which it is not only perfectly capable of receiv- 
ing but which having, it will automatically apply." 

In his chapter on "Language, the Instrument of 
Knowledge," Dr. Berle says that children ought to 
learn words before they can understand them, they 
ought to master long and difficult words. He main- 
tains that for a young child to repeat fifty lines of 
Virgil or an entire Hebrew psalm, even though he 
does not understand a word of what he recites, creates 
"traditions and mind stuff." It has taken three or 
four hundred years of constant pounding to drive 
that notion out of the heads of mechanical teachers. 
It is a very old trick to teach children to pronounce 
words which they do not understand. It is in no 
sense a discovery. But every educational writer from 
Milton down has condemned the practice as wasteful, 
and as inimical to sound intellectual development. 
Dr. Berle maintains that the learning of foreign lan- 
guages has always been the chief means of building 
intellect; but strange to say he does not appreciate 
that the people who developed the language he praises 
most highly for this purpose learned no other tongue 
than their own. Everything he says about the value 
of linguistic learning has been said hundreds of times 
in the past, and most of what he claims for it has been 
shown to be fundamentally unsound. Certain of his 
chapters, for instance those on "Questions and An- 
swers," '"The Elimination of Waste," "Harnessing 
the Imagination," and "Mental Self-Organization," 
contain much that is interesting and sound, presented 
in a picturesque and dynamic style ; but it has all been 
acknowledged by educators for centuries, though of 
course it is not all practised by teachers. The problem 
of modern education is not to get newer and sounder 
theories about education, but to get those that are 
already universally accepted wrought out into practice 
under the conditions which exist in a country where 
there is free and compulsory education for at least 
eight years of every child's life. This problem writ- 
ers like Dr. Berle seem to shy off from most carefully. 

Throughout the world teachers seem to be gaining 
the conception that the school is a social institution. 
We hear it said on all sides now that the chief prob- 
lem of education is to socialize the individual, and that 
the chief concern of modern society is to develop the 
school as the institution best adapted to conserve and 



promote its ideals. Professor King's " Social Aspects 
of Education" is designed to bring together some of 
the more important literature relating to the social 
aspects of education, and the methods of training 
the individual for social adjustment. It is a rather 
novel plan to have a source-book of literature, all of 
which has been written within the past few years, 
and some of which has come very recently from the 
press ; but the plan commends itself from one stand- 
point, at least, in that many persons who are 
interested in social pr&blems, particularly as such 
problems relate to the school, have been heretofore 
unable to gain access to the mass of valuable litera- 
ture scattered through various books and magazines. 
But brought together in this form, it is easily ac- 
cessible, and enables the reader to gain a fair con- 
ception of the trend of modern thought regarding 
the attitude of society toward the school, and the 
curriculum and methods of teaching in relation to 
the development of the child as a social being. The 
first half of the book treats such questions as the 
social origin of educational agencies, the social 
responsibility of the school, the relations of the 
home and the school, the school as a social centre, 
the need of continuation schools, playgrounds, 
school gardens, industrial and vocational education, 
the duty of the school to promote social progress 
and social reform. The second half treats of the 
internal social aspects of education, including the 
spontaneous social life of children, social life of 
the school, social aspects of mental development, and 
the social aspect of the learning process. While it 
may seem to some readers that the scope of social 
education as presented in this book is too broad, in- 
cluding too many relations of the school to society, 
and too many of the activities of teaching; still it 
appears to the present reviewer that it is possible 
and profitable to view all the relations and activities 
of the school from the social standpoint. At the end 
of each chapter a number of problems are proposed 
for discussion, and there is a bibliography which 
covers all the more important book and magazine 
literature relating to the particular topics considered. 
The book as a whole ought to be very acceptable to 
teachers, and to others who have a serious interest 
in the trend of modern educational development 
toward making the school the centre of social life, 
and the chief means of promoting social ideals and 
securing social progress. 

There is a current tendency among teachers to 
read only such educational literature as relates spe- 
cifically to definite problems concerning studies, 
methods of teaching, or plans of organization and 
managing a school. Formerly teachers were expected 
to read something concerning the philosophy of edu- 
cation; but now many of them fail to acquire the 
larger view of the nature of the educational process, 
and its function in the social organism and in the 
development of the individual. In these days people 
are interested primarily in the results of experimen- 
tation in education. They hanker after facts that 
have been carefully observed or worked out experi-

mentally. They like the biological, psychological, 
and sociological methods of discussing educational 
questions; and practically all modern educational 
books that make a strong appeal to American 
teachers are written from one or another, or from 
all, of these standpoints. But Professor John A. 
MacVannel has resisted the prevailing fashion, and 
has put forth a book written from the philosophical 
point of view. His purpose is to deal with the sub- 
ject of education in its largest aspects. His work 
does not pretend to be a conmbution to the science of 
education, or to the art of teaching. What it does 
aim at is to make the serious student of education 
see what the educative process is in relation to the 
whole range of human life and activities. The book 
comprises the lectures which Professor MacVannel 
has been giving to his students in Teachers College, 
Columbia University. One cannot doubt that for ad- 
vanced students the point of view taken is exceedingly 
helpful ; but it would not be possible for a novice to 
get anything out of the book, simply because it deals 
with the largest conceptions regarding education, 
and these conceptions cannot be grasped until one 
has come widely and intimately into contact with the 
concrete aspects of education, and until one has made 
some progress in organizing the phenomena of society 
in order to gain certain fundamental notions regard- 
ing its nature, its aims, and the conditions essential 
for its perpetuity and prosperity. Throughout the 
book runs the conception that the supreme purpose 
of education is to help the individual in attaining 
proper adaptation to his social and physical environ- 
ments. In human life the long period of infancy 
makes it necessary that there should be some guid- 
ance of the individual in the adaptive process. If 
there were no period of infancy, there would be no 
education, because the individual could not adapt 
himself progressively to his environments ; but with 
a long period of infancy, education is not only possible 
but it is imperative." The doctrine of evolution is 
accepted, and is made the basis for the presupposi- 
tions and implications of education. The treatment 
throughout is in accord with contemporary thought, 
not only philosophical, but also biological, sociolog- 
ical, and psychological. He who has completed the 
reading of this book feels that he has gained a view 
of education which enables him to see its relation 
to the sum total of human activities, and the role it 
plays or should play, in shaping the life of the indi- 
vidual and of the social organism. 

American educational theory and practice are 
being based ever more largely upon accurate psy- 
chological observation and experimentation. Many 
of the processes of the schoolroom are now being 
subjected to laboratory tests in the effort to discover 
how the child learns most economically and effec- 
tively. "The Learning Process," by Professor Col- 
vin, sums up effectively the results of experimental 
studies which have been made at home and abroad 
on the learning processes. The point of view of the 
book is in line with modern psychological writing 



in America; that is to say, it is based on the bio- 
logical and functional view of the mind. In an ear- 
lier day psychologists discussed mental processes as 
though they occurred without reference to tin- nreil.s 
of adjustment to the world in which the individual 
lived; but this method of treating psychology is 
being abandoned in America. This is particularly 
true of psychologists who are interested in educa- 
tion, and who are writing for the purpose of deter- 
mining educational theory and practice. Professor 
Cul \ in's book is throughout based on the conception 
that the purpose of mental activity is to secure ad- 
justment. The way in which the mental functions 
occur, and the combinations among them, are deter- 
mined by the purpose or end to be attained in the 
process of adjustment. This is the point of view 
which will be of service to the teacher, because he 
is always concerned with a reacting being. Tin- 
teacher, as such, cannot have much interest in a 
static psychology which treats sensation, perception. 
memory, reason, and the like, as formal processes 
unrelated to behavior. The teacher is interested in 
shaping his children's conduct or adjustment; and 
in order to be of help to him any discussion of 
the learning processes must deal with the child's 
responses to stimulations. It really makes no 
difference what happens within only as this deter- 
mines behavior. One might easily develop a psy- 
chology of conduct, adequate for the teacher's needs, 
without saying anything about sensation, perception, 
and the like. While Professor Colvin's book is writ- 
ten from the functional standpoint, and while he con- 
stantly interprets psychological processes with respect 
to the needs of the teacher, still his treatment is to a 
certain extent formal and logical, iu that he does not 
start from the viewpoint of the novice in discussing 
the learning processes, but rather from that of one 
who has reached large generalizations, and who has 
classified all the mental functions. A novice will 
not be interested in sensation, say, at the beginning 
of an inquiry into the learning process. He will 
not be interested in reflex action or instinct. He 
might, in an analysis of the learning process, finally 
reach the most elementary processes, but he ought 
to arrive at them last rather than first in his study 
of the methods of learning. If Professor Colvin had 
in his own book followed the method which he ex- 
pounds so effectively, he would have put sensation, 
reflex action, and instinct as the last topics in his book 
rather than as the first. The chief value of thin 
volume lies in the fact that it sums up authoritatively 
a great deal of experimentation on the various pro- 
cesses involved in the learning of different sorts of 
material,and makes educational interpretations of the 
conclusions reached from those experiment. There 
are no educational doctrines presented in the book 
that may not be found in educational writings familiar 
to American teachers of educational theory, though 
most other writers have deduced their principles from 
their observation and experience rather than from 
accurate psychological experimentation. It may 
safely be said that any teacher who becomes familiar

with the contents of this book will have gained in an 
agreeable form the best that has been accomplished 
up to date in the experimental study of the learning 
process. This does not mean that one can endorse 
every interpretation of experimental data made by 
Professor Colvin ; but still the present reviewer has 
found very little that he would take exception to ; and 
he considers that the book, as a whole, is thoroughly 
sound, and that it ought to prove of distinct service 
in solidifying American educational theory. 

Professor Strayer's "A Brief Course in the 
Teaching Process " is written from the same general 
standpoint as Professor Colvin's book, although the 
method of treatment is altogether different. Pro- 
fessor Stray er regards adjustment as the end of 
teaching. He considers that for economy and effi- 
ciency in learning, the pupil must have a motive 
before him in all that he does, a purpose, or an 
end to attain. This is entirely in accord with Pro- 
fessor Colvin's point of view, and with modern 
American psychology. Professor Strayer discusses, 
first, the end of education; then the factors condi- 
tioning the teaching process ; and then the teaching 
process itself. Not until he reaches his fourth 
chapter does he come to the problem which would 
constitute a motive for the novice to study the 
teaching process, namely, to learn how to conduct 
a lesson so that pupils would get the points to be 
presented, retain them, and be able to utilize them. 
To the mind of the reviewer, it would be more 
effective in discussing practical problems of teaching 
to strike at once at actual, concrete, every-day situa- 
tions, and work out principles and generalizations 
therefrom. The large conceptions ought to come 
last and not first in any psychological method of 
presentation of material to a novice; and presum- 
ably the persons for whom this book is designed are 
not familiar with the principles of teaching. The 
strongest phase of Professor Strayer's book is to be 
found in the excellent questions, problems, and 
exercises given at the end of each chapter. These 
are, for the most part, vital and intensely interesting ; 
and they illustrate the principle enunciated above, 
that the proper thing to do is to drive straight at 
actual, every-day problems, requiring the pupil to 
deal with them and to get his principles out of them. 
The questions and problems in Professor Strayer's 
book are more concrete and vital than the text. 
The chapters are very brief, necessitating a rather 
abstract and monotonous method of treatment. The 
principles all seem to be sound and of worth, but they 
are not presented in as stimulating and attention- 
catching a manner as they might be. There is too 
great a tendency for classification in the text to suit 
the taste of the present reviewer, and occasionally one 
finds a problem which suggests the same tendency. 
But on the whole, the book exhibits a sane interest 
in concrete, effective teaching, and no teacher can 
go through it and get its point of view, and espe- 
cially work out the problems, without being helped 
immensely thereby. M y. O'SHEA. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

The decline of That republicanism, after serving a 
republicanism distinctly useful purpose in the lib- 
in Europe. eralizing of the modern European 

world, has virtually completed its work and is at 
present clearly on the wane, is the interesting and 
well-sustained thesis of Mr. H. A. L. Fisher's volume, 
"The Republican Tradition in Europe" (Putnam). 
With some slight emendations, this book comprises 
a course of lectures delivered by Mr. Fisher before 
the Lowell Institute in Boston early in 1910. It 
does not purport to be history, but rather a com- 
mentary upon history. Inasmuch, however, as no one 
save the Spanish publicist, Emilio Castelar, has at any 
time undertaken a systematic history of European 
republicanism (and he with indifferent success), 
there is clearly a place for even so meagre an out- 
line as that which Mr. Fisher gives. Starting from 
the collapse of republicanism with the rise of the 
Roman Empire, the author undertakes to outline 
against the predominantly monarchical background 
of mediaeval and modern Europe the survivals and 
revivals of the republican spirit, through successive 
stages marked especially by the sporadic Italian re- 
publics of the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth 
centuries ; the rise of the Dutch republic ; English 
experiments with republicanism in the era of the 
Commonwealth and Protectorate; the first French 
republic, with its brood of tributary republics of the 
earlier Napoleonic period; the second and third 
republics in France; the republican movements in 
Germany and Italy at the middle of the past cen- 
tury ; and the failure of the republican regime in 
Spain during the seventies. The republican move- 
ment in Europe, in the author's opinion, reached its 
height in 1848. The creation of the third republic 
in France, in 1870-75, took place under conditions 
such that the political atmosphere of even the adja- 
cent portions of Europe was not perceptibly affected. 
The recent substitution of republicanism for mon- 
archy in Portugal occasioned a mild stir in Spain, 
but nothing more. Aside from France and Portu- 
gal, Switzerland alone among European states main- 
tains a republican form of government, and the 
influence of Swiss political ideas is not large. In 
1905 the Norwegians were in a position to establish 
a republic had they cared to do so; but the repub- 
lican programme never enlisted many adherents. 
Throughout Europe as a whole, and especially Teu- 
tonic, Scandinavian, and Slavic Europe, monarchy, 
of the enlightened and constitutional type, is firmly 
entrenched. To this situation a variety of circum- 
stances have contributed, to mention but two, the 
improved personnel of present-day rulers as compared 
with many of their predecessors of two or three gen- 
erations ago, and the growth of imperialism and of 
a world policy which seems to require the personal 
leadership of monarchs. The most fundamental 
stronghold of enlightened monarchy to-day, how- 
ever, appears clearly to be the growing recognition 
of the fact that the precise form assumed by the

executive in a government is no measure of the 
amount of political and civil liberty which a people 
may enjoy under that government, that, in con- 
junction with parliamentary institutions, responsible 
ministers, and a broad franchise, the institution of 
monarchy may easily contribute to, rather than 
detract from, the real interests of liberalism and 
progress. 

Problem, of th< Dr - J - Adam8 Paffer > in his excellent 
voungineitv book on "The Boy and his Gang" 
ami country. (Houghton), discusses a subject that 
not many people a few years ago would have regarded 
as even worthy of investigation. It has always been 
known that there were boys' gangs ; but they were 
explained as being the natural outgrowth of original 
sin, and so dismissed without further inquiry. But 
now comes a writer, who, in a concrete and dynamic 
way, discusses the boy and his general problems; 
the nature of the gang, and the way in which it is 
organized ; the activities of the gang, including group 
games, stealing, hectoring people, truancy, fighting, 
and the like. Then he goes on to consider the an- 
thropology and psychology of the gang ; the control of 
primitive and predatory impulses ; the love of adven- 
ture and of truancy; the virtues of the gang; the 
gang in constructive social work; the gang in the 
school ; and the like. This book should arouse an in- 
terest among people who know boys, who would like 
to help them to develop in a wholesome way, and who 
appreciate the tremendous problems arising out of 
the rapid development of urban life in America. No 
civilization has yet solved the problem of city life, 
mainly because no civilization has been able to con- 
trol the disastrous influences exerted upon the young, 
mainly the boys, who have to grow up in the streets 
of the city. The gang is a product of urban civili- 
zation which takes little or no account of the needs 
of immature as contrasted with mature individuals. 
The experience of older civilizations has taught us 
that the thing of primary importance in any city is 
to make provision for the proper activities of the 
young, so that their energies may not be turned 
into evil channels. The reading of this book by Dr. 
Puffer should be of distinct service to those who have 
anything to do with developing boys, or determining 
the conditions under which they must live in cities. 
Of course, the country boy has his problems too, and 
the country girl as well. We have perhaps assumed 
too much in regard to the opportunities of the coun- 
try for the proper occupation and development of the 
young. Professor William A. McKeever's "Farm 
Boys and Girls" (Macmillan) should be of as great 
interest and importance to men and women in rural 
life as Dr. Puffer's book should be to people in the 
city. Professor McKeever discusses many aspects of 
rural life in relation to the occupation and training of 
the young, such as juvenile literature in the farm 
home, the rural church and young people, the making 
of a new rural school, the country mother and the 
children, the country Young Men's Christian Associ- 
ation, the work which should be done by the country 



boy and the country girl, the farmer and his wife as 
leaders of the young, the social training of boys and 
girls in the country, the business training of the boy 
and the girl, and the choice of vocation for both the 
boy and the girl. The discussion of these various 
topics appears to be sound, and based on first-hand 
acquaintance with actual conditions. 



Minor Enoiith m * nor seventeenth century En- 

pottt of the glish poets offer, one would think, ex- 
t;th centurv. ceptional opportunities to editor and 
commentator. The title of Mr. Carl Holliday's 
book, "The Cavalier Poets: Their Lives, their Day, 
and their Poetry" (Neale), sounds attractive, and 
the volume looks inviting; but its contents are dis- 
appointing, for only 130 of its 300 pages are given 
to selections from a bare score of poets, and the 
special chapters on the ten more important of these 
men are not nearly as satisfying as more selections 
would have been. A book of this kind should justify 
itself either by special fulness of selection, or by the 
character and quality of its critical comment. Only 
four of the poets represented here are missing from 
the second volume of Ward's "English Poets"; and 
for the other seventeen, Ward has 136 poems against 
the 104 given here. In one or two instances, Mr. 
Holliday's book improves on Ward: it includes Her- 
bert's "Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright," and 
Waller's "When we for age could neither read nor 
write, "and has a better as well as a slightly fuller selec- 
tion from Lovelace. On the other hand, it omits 
Carew's "He that loves a rosy cheek" and Her- 
rick's "Litany"; and at the end of the selections from 
Herrick there was blank space enough to print " Fair 
pledges of a fruitful tree," and either "Here a little 
child I stand" or "In this little urn is laid." Moreover, 
Denham, Randolph, Cleveland, and Butler would 
seem to demand some mention among the "Cavalier" 
poets, even if Benlowes, and Shakerley Marmion, 
and Patrick Hannay, and Chamberlayne, and Philip 
Ayres, and a dozen others are to be omitted. The 
editor's comments are disappointing, for in spite of 
a manner which reminds one faintly of that critic 
in whom chiefly the Tory spirit is now incarnate, 
they are neither especially acute nor particularly 
informed. For example, he says of Waller's " Last 
Verses" only this: "Here we may see how closely 
the poet has approached the couplet form, soon to 
be used so successfully in the 'classical' period." 
In the list of "Works by the Cavalier Poets" there 
should have been noted : J. M. Berdan's edition of 
Cleveland ; G. H. Palmer's edition of Herbert ; the 
1702 edition of Sedley; and for Chas. Sackville 
(Earl of Dorset) something later than 1750, for his 
poems are in Johnson's, Anderson's, Chalmers's, and 
Sharpe's "British Poets." One might question, too, 
the advisability of giving up two pages to a list of 

| Wither's works, immediately after reference to two 
collected editions. The Bibliography would have

siastical Allegory of the First Book of the Faerie 
Queene " (Ginn) the second in a series of publica- 
tions in the field of English issued by the University 
of Washington. The author limits himself to an ex- 
amination of the First Book of Spenser's poem, for, 
as he believes: "It is indeed a question if Spenser 
did not attempt a minuteness of historical delineation 
that proved increasingly burdensome as the work pro- 
gressed, and that required simplification of the orig- 
inal design ; there would seem to be a hint of such 
a change in the closing stanza of the opening book, 
when the poet complains that 

' We must land some of our passengers, 
And light this wearie vessell of her lode.' " 

However this may be, the conjectural identifications 
of political characters and ecclesiastical tendencies 
are interesting, and in some cases obviously felicitous. 
The wonder is that Professor Padelford is not more 
thoroughly convinced of his own success. That the 
Blatant Beast represents certain aspects of the Puri- 
tan movement can hardly be doubted, if we inspect 
the reference in the conversations of Ben Jonson 
with Drummond of Hawthornden. This reference 
forms the real centre of the study, and very prob- 
ably may have furnished the impulse to the entire 
research. A light-hearted attitude is betrayed in the 
words of the Preface, to the effect that when the 
interpreter has done his best, or worst, with the alle- 
gory, this last "is in no more parlous state than it 
was before." One does not specially care for such a 
tone in the serious study of literature; but at all 
events we can see how times have changed in this 
country since the days when the first of American 
scholars in English, Francis J. Child, allowed himself 
to say that his purpose in his " Observations " on the 
"Faerie Queene" had been "to give a very general 
view of the allegory" even in Book I. "and not 
to pursue, into any minuteness of detail, the parallel 
between what is told and what is meant."

humor from dashed with an occasional colloquial-

"sjang"), and making free use of allusions which 
would have meant nothing twenty or even ten years 
ago, Mr. Charles Johnston's illustrative (and also 
illustrated) review of the humor of the world from 
the most ancient times is something very different 
from a jest-book, as the term is commonly understood. 
A rapid survey of the humor of ancient Egypt and 
Greece, of China and Japan, of Turkey, Italy, Spain, 



England, and other countries known to us as not un- 
friendly to mirth, including of course our own jocund 
republic, yields material, not too hackneyed in fact, 
agreeably fresh in most instances for a Volume of 
nearly four hundred pages, entitled " Why the World 
Laughs " (Harper). It makes clear, not by Bergson- 
ian reasoning, but by apt example, why laughing is 
as easy as lying, if not easier. The author's readers 
of the fair sex may take umbrage at this sentence 
from an early page: "Japan contributes to the mirth 
of the world one of the rarest of all things, a lady 
humorist." To be told that one has no sense of hu- 
mor is a thing unbearable to any man or woman of 
proper spirit. Mr. Johnston's considerable acquaint- 
ance with various parts of the world qualifies him to 
write understandingly on his chosen theme. He was 
born in Ireland, educated for the Bengal civil service, 
and spent several years in India, whence he returned 
home as an invalid, and later wandered to this coun- 
try, of which he became a citizen nine years ago. He 
is a member of the Royal Asiatic Society and of the 
Irish Society of America. Naturally his chapter on 
Hibernian humor is among the best and most original 
in the book. A dozen good pictures are contributed 
by Mr. Peter Newell and other artists. 



Renaissance 
architecture 
in France. 



Mr. W. H. Ward's "Architecture of 
the Renaissance in France" (Scribner) 
will be welcomed alike by architects 
and by lovers of the fine arts. Until now, no work 
dealing exhaustively with the whole subject has ap- 
peared in English or even in French, says the author ; 
the student has been restricted to the necessarily 
scanty accounts of the style in the general histories of 
architecture. A more extended treatment was there- 
fore a desideratum ; and did we need any such justifi- 
cation of his two handsome octavo volumes, Mr. Ward 
might point to the closely-printed index, covering 
twenty-eight double-columned pages, which reveals 
the scope of the work as much as the range of his 
carefully selected illustrations. Four hundred and 
sixty- five altogether, many of them measured draw- 
ings, and all of them most beautifully printed, they 
give in themselves a vivid history of French Renais- 
sance architecture, reproductions of old prints and 
plans lending a keener interest to the modern sketch 
or half-tone or brilliant photogravure. Nor is the 
text itself less clear, in spite of its compact array of 
facts and details ; it is not too technical for the gen- 
eral student of art. Starting with the reign of 
Louis XII. and the beginnings of the Italian influ- 
ence (to which Mr. Ward, following Seymiiller, gives 
full credit), the narrative is brought down to 1830, 
when, with the advent of Romanticism and the Gothic 
revival, the varied but unbroken sequence of Renais- 
sance styles came to an end or merged into eclec- 
ticism. Eight chapters, each prefaced by a brief 
historical introduction, discuss these various styles; 
the division of the subject by reigns being adopted 
for its utility, and because it is the best classification 
in a country wherein the court exerted a dominant 
influence on the evolution of design.

Thought* on 



Huxley has rendered 
no trifling service to the educational 
Matthew Arnold. wor id by collecting, in a volume of 
some 300 pages, almost as many (240) excerpts, 
entitled "Thoughts on Education from Matthew 
Arnold" (Macmillan). The book owed its incep- 
tion, " and not its inception only, but a host of prac- 
tical suggestions," to Mr. Theodore Reunert of the 
Johannesburg Council of Education; but it reveals 
the care and taste of the editor in every part. Un- 
like his distinguished father, Matthew Arnold did 
not succeed in evolving his general theory of culture 
and education from an experience partly gained by 
thorough investigation in a special field of human 
knowledge; for his survey of instruction upon the 
Continent did not pierce deeply enough into histor- 
ical origins to be accounted a form of research; in 
fact, as his essay "On Translating Homer" shows, 
the son on occasion had no particular sympathy 
with detailed scholarly procedure. As they were 
travelling together in a railway carriage, Goldwin 
Smith observed a pile of books at Arnold's side. 
"These," said Matthew, with a gay air, "are Celtic 
books which they send me. Because I have written 
on Celtic literature, they fancy I must know some- 
thing of the language." " His ideas," added Goldwin 
Smith, in relating the incident, " had been formed by 
a few weeks at a Welsh watering-place." His duties as 
Inspector of Schools, however, afforded him a wide 
acquaintance with contemporary methods of instruc- 
tion in England, and in Germany and France ; and 
he brought to the solution of educational problems 
the native insight and sympathy of a poet, together 
with a large measure of refined common sense. The 
present volume makes good reading. The qualities 
of lucidity and proportion which characterize his lit- 
erary essays are not absent from the reports which 
Arnold made to various commissioners. Accord- 
ingly, if we are not ready to challenge the admission 
of so much material from the more popular works, 
we gladly welcome the many passages from less 
accessible sources, which, but for this interesting col- 
lection, probably never would have met our eyes. 

"Turkey and Its People," by Sir 
Edwin Pears, may be unhesitatingly 
recommended to readers desiring a 
serious, trustworthy, and well-written treatment of 
the subjects naturally implied in such a title. The 
author has published a number of historical books 
and many scholarly articles, but is probably best 
known to the general public for his stirring contribu- 
tions to the London ' Daily News " on the Moslem 
atrocities in Bulgaria during 1876. By these letters 
he kindled a flame of indignation against Turkey 
that swept over the whole of the Western world. Re- 
calling the date of these events, and realizing that in 
the interval the distinguished writer has been adding 
knowledge to knowledge and judgment to judgment, 
one looks for an admirable treatise in the present 
work, and is not disappointed. In fact, the volume 
proves a constant source of pleasure. Perhaps from 



Sir Edwin's legal training, perhaps from natural fit- 
ness, he can give both sides of a case with singular 
fairness, and can decry a particular fault without 
condemning a whole nation. These qualities are 
noticeable through all the four hundred pages, but 
are especially prominent in the illuminating final 
chapter, which deals with "Signs of Improvement in 
Turkey." Misprints are rare; but on page 288 we 
are confronted with thirty cans of ''Kerosim- "; and 
on page 11, "incapable" raises the question whether 
it ought not to be " capable." The type is easily legi- 
ble, and there is a serviceable index. There should 
be a good map; and its omission from such a work 
is a serious defect. (George H. Doran Co.) 

Having already told us in a previous 
:* <> f the Royal North-West 
Mounted Police of Canada, Mr. A. L. 
Haydon now gives us an excellent account of "The 
Trooper Police of Australia" (McClurg). In spite 
of differences in details, the two forces have in com- 
mon an exceptional efficiency, a wide range of duties, 
and a brave record of adventurous deeds. In Aus- 
tralia each State has its own force, which in turn is 
divided into foot and mounted police. Only the latter 
are considered by Mr. Haydon, but he does more 
than merely chronicle the exploits of his heroes. His 
volume contains a brief narrative of the history of 
the Australian colonies ; and much of the social his- 
tory of the times may be read in the record of the 
police force. The first body was established in 1825 
in New South Wales; and on this force, as it de- 
veloped, the other troops were modelled. Five chap- 
ters telling of the work of the police during the bush- 
ranging days are filled with exciting incident. Other 
chapters describe the rush for gold, the police ex- 
plorations, the problem of the aborigines, and the 
work of the Mark trackers. The police work in each 
of the Continental States and in the Northern Ter- 
ritory is treated in special chapters, from which may 
be gathered some idea of the manifold duties of these 
highly-trained, centrally-administered forces, and 
some idea also of the magnificent distances over 
which they operate on one case a Western Aus- 
tralian trooper rode 1700 miles during six months. 
The volume contains fifty-one excellent illustrations 
and three maps. _

culties with his antagonistic colleagues (whom he 
beguiled into praising a work of his own, submitted 
under a false name) must be read in the full to 
secure its flavor. The same impulse that made the 
acceptance of medical fees distasteful, and the earn- 
ing of a living by one's pen injurious to high ideals, 
turned Van Eeden more and more to the career of 
social reformer ; and a discussion of social coopera- 
tive projects occupies the larger part, of the book. 
Despite the usual financial failure of these ventures, 
he maintains his belief in this road to human 
happiness, and describes his cooperative colony in 
North Carolina as a success. Quite apart from the 
interest in this social experiment and the addresses 
which set forth its purpose and methods, the volume 
records the attractive life of a modern idealist. 



Two hand-books Mr " Frederic J. Haskin has shown 
on American himself to be a newspaper writer of 
government. considerable versatility, ranging in 
topics from insecticides to tyrannicides. His series 
on "The American Government," which appeared 
in the newspapers last year, has now been collected 
in book form (Lippincott), and proves to be a very 
good popular treatment of the subject. Naturally it 
lacks the profundity to be found in the more serious 
treatises, but it contains a good deal of useful infor- 
mation about the activities of our government which 
college professors and others will be glad to have in 
this handy form. Not only are the executive, leg- 
islative, and judicial departments and the various 
cabinet positions dealt with, but a good deal of infor- 
mation is given about the actual work of the various 
bureaus and even the Pan-American Union. In 
"The United States Government" (Neale), a book 
of less than half the size of Mr. Haskin's, Mr. Victor 
P. Hammer has dealt with the same general subject, 
contenting himself, for the most part, with a bare 
statement of facts regarding the various departments 
of the government and the cabinet positions. The list 
of persons who have held office in the cabinet will be 
serviceable to those who are interested in that subject. 
A wide reading by the general public of such books 
as these two would go far toward raising the standard 
of intelligence regarding public affairs. 

The legend "third impression" on the 
title-page of Mr. Edmond Holmes's 
"What Is and What Might Be: A 
Study of Education in General and Elementary Edu- 
cation in Particular" (London: Constable) may be 
taken as an encouraging sign of open-mindedness 
on the part of those Englishmen who are interested 
in education and life. Mr. Holmes's work is by no 
means, as its title might imply, a mere critique of 
pedagogy in the narrow sense. It is, on the contrary, 
a revolutionary plea for a trans valuation of all West- 
ern values. The author's criticism of the schools of 
Britain is but a criticism of both English and Ameri- 
can life in general that its aim is results, and me- 
chanical drill and praise of externals and conformity 
its method. As against this he sets an ideal, largely

drawn from Buddhistic inspiration, in which the 
evocation of individuality is the end sought. This 
may sound fantastic, but when it is remembered that 
the essence of Buddhism is self-realization as opposed 
to the externalism of the West, and that even our 
Western religious teachers are beginning to see that 
the development of the "inner life " of the individual 
is the necessary antecedent to all true social growth, 
Mr. Holmes will perhaps not be considered too far off 
the track. While his chapters on a school in Utopia 
will interest teachers, his book as a whole will appeal 
to all to whom the inner life is a reality or an aspir- 
ation, and over whose souls Mammon does not hold 

undisputed sway. 

Outside of Italy, the best place to 
study Italian art is Berlin ; also, to 
study German, Dutch, and Flemish 
art the best place is Berlin. Many other cities 
exhibit greater single masterpieces and larger collec- 
tions, but no other furnishes us so complete an oppor- 
tunity to trace the history of art chronologically and 
comprehensively. Therefore the Berlin galleries 
have come to be recognized as the best student gal- 
leries in Europe. In the five buildings that con- 
stitute what is known as the museum group, the 
re-arrangement of the art-collections is so compara- 
tively recent that the old guide-books are quite out 
of date. Hence, Mr. David C. Preyer's volume on 
"The Art of the Berlin Galleries" (Page) is sure 
of the warm welcome that it deserves. It is enter- 
tainingly and sympathetically written, and its forty- 
seven illustrations are well chosen and well executed. 
A little more caution on the part of the author, how- 
ever, would have made the book even better. For 
example, he should not have attributed seven pic- 
tures to Botticelli, when only two have the warrant 
of the best authorities; he should have avoided re- 
peating certain traditions which modern inquiry 
rejects. But in general, both in its method and its 
matter, the book deserves a place in the admirable 
series of which it forms the twelfth volume " The 
Art Galleries of Europe." 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Schiller's " Don Carlos " has been most elaborately 
edited by Dr. Frederick W. C. Lieder for the " Oxford 
German Series " of Mr. Henry Frowde. Upwards of 
three hundred pages of editorial matter accompany the 
text, considerably outweighing it in volume. 

Mr. S. E. Forman's " Advanced Civics " is one of the 
best text-books with which we are acquainted, a fact 
which creates a favorable presumption for his new work, 
" The American Republic " (Century Co.), prepared for 
somewhat younger students. The plan of the two works 
is the same, although the new one has the advantage of 
being illustrated. 

As a by-product of the system of exchange profes- 
sorships between American and German universities,

The selection of "Early English Poems" (Holt), 
made by Messrs. Henry S. Pancoast and John Duncan 
Spaeth, provides the student with a large amount of 
material antedating the seventeenth century. It sup- 
plements Mr. Pancoast's "Standard English Poems," 
which begins with Spenser. The selections from Old 
English are translated, and those from Middle English 
modernized. 

The demand for Spanish texts seems to be on the 
increase, and the supply keeps pace with it. Messrs. 
Henry Holt & Co. have just published these three 
volumes: " La Coja y el Encogido," by Juan Eugenio 
Hartzenbusch, edited by Dr. J. Geddes, Jr. ; "Consuelo," 
by Adelardo Lopez de Ayala, edited by Dr. Aurelio M. 
Espinosa; and a volume of "Romances Escogidos," 
edited by Dr. S. Griswold Morley. 

Professor Dowden's book on " Shakespeare : His Mind 
and Art," though written nearly forty years ago, when 
the author was comparatively a very young man, took 
from the first a high place among works of Shakes- 
pearean criticism, and repeated editions testify to its 
soundness and vitality. A reprint of the latest edition 
is now issued by Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. under the 
name of the " Author's American and Colonial Edition." 

The late Miss E. F. A. Baumgartner, a Swiss lady

"A Medley of Birthdays." A dace to a page is the rule, 
and each page gives quotations from one or more famous 
people who were born upon the day assigned to it It

The " Lyrical Ballads " of Wordsworth and Coleridge, 
reprinted in type facsimile from the original edition of 
1798, and edited by Dr. Harold Littledale, is published

volumes of the Oxford reprints. Another new volume 
in this collection contains " Hurd's Letters on Chivalry 
and Romance " (1757) and his " Third Elizabethan Dia- 
logue " (1759), edited by Miss Edith J. Morley. Hurd 
was one of the heralds of the romantic revival in criti- 
cism, but his work has become wellnigh forgotten. 

During the past year or two a number of texts for 
class-room use have been contributed by the younger 
group of American psychologists. " A System of Psy- 
chology," by Professor Knight Dunlap of Johns Hop- 
kins University (Scribner), is the most recent. Like 
its predecessors, it adds little to the vitality or to the 
extent of resources available to the instructor. It shows 
independence of treatment and definiteness of view; 
yet it lacks the larger grasp of the field of mind and of 
the conditions of approach thereto set by the student's 
own psychology. In addition, this text suffers from its 
cavalier treatment of the views of others, and from a 



neglect of perspective that transforms a critical defect 
into a practical obstacle. Yet its moderate merits give 
it a creditable place among books in its field.

issued in the latter part of 1910 and the first half of 
1911, and are given rather by way of suggestion than 
unqualified recommendation. The list follows the Dewey 
classification, gives publishers' names and prices, and 
contains about six hundred entries. It is intended 
especially for smaller libraries, but could hardly fail to 
be of service in the order department of any library. 

Recent reactionary movements in Mexico have neces- 
sitated a revision of the numerous books on that country 
published during the past twenty years. The first of 
these revised surveys to appear is Mr. N. O. Winter's 
"Mexico and her People of To-day " (L. C. Page & Co.), 
originally published in 1907. To the matter in the orig- 
inal edition the author has added a very conservative 
account of the passing of the Diaz regime, together with 
chapters on a hitherto neglected region in and beyond 
the Sierras; and the entire book has been reused to 
bring it into accord with present conditions. Its wealth 
of illustrations has been considerably increased; and 
altogether it now forms an admirable survey of an ex- 
ceedingly interesting country. The author is wisely 
reticent upon the political future of Mexico. 

"The Education of Self" (Funk & Wagnalls) is a 
new translation of Dr. Paul Dubois's book formerly 
issued under the title, " Self Control and How to Secure 
It." The work has no high intrinsic merit of special 
appeal to English readers to justify this reissue. It is 
a readable but discursive survey of the moral grounds 
of self-control, and the attitudes through which it may 
be facilitated. It is far inferior to Payot's " Education 
of the Will," with which it invites comparison. Works 
of this kind are conditioned by subtle relations of author 
and public that make the vernacular address and range 
of illustrations much more effective than the transferred 
medium of an alien mental environment. In the present 
instance the original is a creditable but not a notable 
contribution. 

Niagara and its associations form the subject of a

& Co. will publish this month under the title, "A Candi- 
date for Truth." 

It is interesting news that the Earl of Lytton is writ- 
ing a biography of his grandfather, the famous novelist. 
The Life by the late Lord Lytton Owen Meredith " 
covered only half his father's career. This, therefore, 
will be at once a sequel and a work full of entirely new 
material. 

" The Heritage of Hiroshige: A Glimpse at Japanese 
Landscape Art," by Miss Dora Amsden (author of " Im- 
pressions of Ukiyo-ye ") and Mr. John Stewart Happer, 
is announced by Messrs. Paul Elder & Co. Mr. Happer's 
important discoveries concerning the Hiroshige seals 
are included in the book, with facsimiles of the Zodiacal 
Seals or Cycle Ciphers. 

The fifteenth and concluding volume of the important 
" Catholic Encyclopedia," published by the Robert 
Appleton Company, will be ready during the coming 
autumn. In addition to covering its special ground to 
the last of the alphabet, it will contain departments de- 
voted to criticism of the earlier volumes, corrections, 
commendations, biographies of the contributors, and 
an index. 

An important magazine feature of the month is the 
first instalment, in the May "Century," of "Everybody's 
Saint Francis," by Dr. Maurice Francis Egan, our pres- 
. ent minister to Denmark, and former professor of En- 
glish Language and Literature at the Catholic University 
of America. The illustrations, including several in color, 
are the work of the noted French illustrator, M. Boutet 
de Monvel. 

There has been much speculation as to the authorship 
of " The Autobiography of an Elderly Woman " which 
was published anonymously by Houghton Mifflin Co. last 
autumn. The publishers have just announced that the 
author is Mrs. Mary Heaton Vorse, whose other books, 
" The Very Little Person " and " The Breaking in of a 
Yachtsman's Wife," as well as her frequent magazine 
stories, have made her name well known. 

Dr. Isaac K. Funk, president of the publishing house 
of Funk & Wagnalls Co., died recently in his seventy- 
third year. He was born at Clifton, Ohio, Sept. 10, 
1839, and was educated at Wittenberg College, where 
also he took his course in theology. From 1867 to 
1872 he held various pastorates in the Lutheran church, 
but in 1876 gave up the cure of souls for the publishing 
of books. The other member of the now well-known 
partnership, Mr. A. W. Wagnalls, joined him in 1878, 
and under Dr. Funk's editorship the house erelong be- 



came prominent as the originator of the " Jewish En- 
cyclopsedia," " The Voice," " The Homiletic Review," 
" The Missionary Review," " The Literary Digest," 
and, foremost of all, " The Standard Dictionary." Dr. 
Funk did a great deal of useful work as editor, author, 
and publisher. His own writings include " The Next 
Step in Evolution," "The Widow's Mite and Other 
Psychic Phenomena," and " The Psychic Riddle." 

Sir Charles Dilke's forthcoming biography should be 
one of the most interesting works of its kind -when it 
appears, which may not be for some time, as the announce- 
ment is just made that publication will be postponed 
until after Mr. Joseph Chamberlain shall himself have 
become a fit subject for a complete biography. In other 
words, the life and letters of Sir Charles, now in prepar- 
ation, will contain correspondence, said to be voluminous 
and piquant, between Sir Charles and Mr. Chamberlain, 
as also between Sir Charles and Mr. Gladstone, which 
it is deemed inadvisable to publish within the lifetime 
of any one of the persons concerned. 

Announcement has been made at the University of 
Chicago of a new system of retiring allowances for pro- 
fessors or their widows. A fund of $2,500,000 taken 
from the $10,000,000 Rockefeller gift of 1910 has been 
set aside for this purpose. This pension system will 
grant to men who have attained the rank of assistant 
professor or higher, and who have reached the age of 
sixty-five and have served fifteen years or more in the 
institution, 40 per cent, of their salary and an additional 
2 per cent, for each year's service above fifteen. The 
plan also provides that at the age of seventy a man 
shall be retired unless the Board of Trustees specially 
continues his services. The widow of any professor en- 
titled to the retiring allowance shall receive one- half 
the amount due him provided she has been his wife for 
ten years. 

With the death of Justin McCarthy at Folkestone, 
England, on April 24, a long and productive and useful 
life came to a close. Mr. McCarthy was born in Cork, 
on November 22, 1830. After securing a private edu- 
cation, he entered the field of journalism, in his native 
city, at the age of eighteen; and with that profession 
he has been actively and honorably associated ever since. 
Entering the House of Commons in 1879, he at once at- 
tained a prominent place in the Irish Home-Rule Party, 
becoming in 1886 vice-president of the Irish National 
League. After the deposition of Parnell from the leader- 
ship of the Home-Rule Party in 1890, McCarthy was 
selected as its Parliamentary chief, retaining the post 
until 1896. In 1868 he came to America for an extended 
tour of the country, remaining here three years, during 
which period he was a frequent contributor to our lead- 
ing magazines and for a time maintained a nominal edi- 
torial connection with " The Independent" of New York. 
A second and briefer visit to this country was made in 
1886. Mr. McCarthy was a prolific writer of fiction, 
but it is through his serious historical works that he will 
be longest remembered. These include " The History 
of Our Own Times," "A History of the Four Georges 
and William IV.," " Life of Sir Robert Peel," " Life of 
Pope Leo XIII.," "The Story of Gladstone's Life," 
"Modern England," "The Reign of Queen Anne," and 
" Portraits of the Sixties." His autobiographical " Rem- 
iniscences," published in 1899, have within the past 
month been supplemented by a volume of " Irish Recol- 
lections," covering in greater detail and with no less 
charm the writer's earlier life.

THE RICCARDI PRESS BOOKS 

BY special arrangement with Mr. Philip Lee Warner, publisher to the Medici 
Society, Ltd., of London, the Riccardi Press Books will hereafter be published 
in America by BROWNE'S BOOKSTORE, Chicago. These well-known volumes 
undoubtedly represent the high-water mark in modern book-making. They are set 
in the special Riccardi type which Mr. Herbert P. Home designed for the Medici 
Society. Mr. E. P. Prince, who cut the Kelmscott Press types, has cut the Riccardi 
fount under Mr. Home's direction. The printing is done under the personal super- 
vision of Mr. Charles T. Jacobi, at the famous Chiswick Press, London, upon a fine 
quality of English handmade paper, made especially for this purpose and bearing the 
Riccardi water-mark. Each volume contains ten or more illustrations beautifully 
reproduced in full color, the process of reproduction being the same as that employed 
for the famous Medici reproductions from the Old Masters. The editions are strictly 
limited in every case. The volumes now available are as follows:

(FROM "THE ATHENAEUM," LONDON.) 

books already issued by the Riccardi Press are sufficient to show that the best oj our printers have a serious 
rival in this new enterprise. Mr. Home's type is one of extraordinary brilliance and legibility. . . . There is 
no doubt that this fount of type is one of the best ever cut ; and we congratulate designer, engraver, and publisher on 
a notable achievement. . . . We have nothing but praise for paper, ink, composition, and presswork. . . . We have 
so often spoken of the merits of the Medici process, by which Mr. Flint* s water-colours have been reproduced, that it 
is needless to repeat our praise of the results obtained. . . . The handling of this book brings to mind forcibly the 
pious remark of Dr. Butler, rtcorded by Izaak Walton in his " Compleat Angler," on the strawberry. There might 
conceivably have been a more perfect book of its kind doubtless; but doubtless there never has been one. . . . A 
wonderfully complete piece of work, wfach will be a pure joy to any into whose hands it may fall. . . . The Riccardi 
Press books stand on our shelves beside the Doves Press books and those of the Kelmscott Press each of them with its 
own peculiar beauty emphasized by that of its fellows. 



A descriptive four-page prospectus of the Riccardi Press Books, with a specimen illustration in full 
color and a specimen page showing the Riccardi type and paper, will be sent to any address upon 
receipt of ten cents in stamps. All correspondence should be addressed to the American Agents,

The Baroness, who, after a gloomy and neglected child- 
hood, made a loveless marriage, found herself some years 
later the victim of a divorce scandal and a social outcast. 
At this critical time the man of her destiny, the great 
Prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfurst, entered her life. 
Their attachment was as lasting as it was spontaneous. 
The book contains many intimate sketches of, and allu- 
sions to, people of prominence.

An allegory of fantasy dealing with the hope of immor-

or ontological exposition of what is hidden behind the 
veil of death, but deals with the subject imaginatively 
or poetically, seeking, as he says, " to translate hopes 
into visions."

ivas elected Governor. 



Fifty Years in 
Oregon 

By Governor T. T. GEER 

TN this book Mr. Geer, formerly Governor of 
J - Oregon, and one of her notable figures, gives 
the wonderful story of that State in rapidly 
moving pictures, in pictures of the experiences 



of the pioneer, of forceful men, of brave women, of abundant land, of picturesque 
scenery. He stretches before us a panorama of Oregon from the early '40's to the pres- 
ent time. And a marvelously interesting panorama it is, exquisite in color, clear in 
detail, wonderful in variety and extent, glowing in the forces that produce prosperity. 

Mr. Geer's style is inimitable. The personality, the genial, wholesome, delight- 
ful personality of the man, is in every line that he writes. Whether discussing the 
expedition of Lewis and Clark, or Jefferson's diplomatic somersault in connection 
with the Louisiana purchase, or the religious denominations that strove for supremacy 
in the new territory, or the building of schools and colleges, or births, marriages, and 
deaths, the man behind the pen illumines his work with much heartiness and sym- 
pathy. Under his touch the most trivial subject becomes interesting. 

Out of a life full of interesting experiences and of that warm 
contact with his fellow-man that is known only to the pioneer, he 
intersperses his narrative with enough wit, humor, wisdom, phil- 
osophy, and anecdote to beguile the most blase person into wishing 
to while away many a moment under his friendly and optimistic 
influence. 

Pittsburgh Post: 



" If all histories were written in as con- 
versational a style as ex-Governor Geer has 
written ' Fifty Years in Oregon,' there would 
be more history read. Mr. Geer does not 
claim that his book is strictly an historical 
document. Rather does it consist of a series 
of reminiscences. Yet in these reminis- 
cences may be found practically all the lead- 
ing historical events which have transpired 
in Oregon during the last half century. 
There is also a graphic description of the 
early days in Oregon, those days long before 
Mr. Geer's time, when the country was being 
settled by the whites. 

" Oregon was settled by people who went 
there to establish homes and not by such 
adventurers as went by the thousands to 



California, ' to settle down there because 
they couldn't settle up where they came 
from.' Yet the very heterogeneousness of its 
early population provided California with 
material for merchants, bankers, sailors, 
steamboat men, miners, farmers, stock- 
raisers, etc., while Oregon, on the other hand, 
was retarded in growth because nearly all 
its early population was of one class. But 
while the early growth of Oregon was slow 
in comparison with the brilliant progress of 
California this is now proving an advantage 
to the State. 

" This entire book is interesting, even the 
portions dealing with political events (and 
there are many such) being irradiated with 
the author's genial style and optimism."

THE BROWNING CENTENARY. 

The centenary of Kobert Browning's birth 
has come upon us almost unawares, for it seems 
only yesterday that he was alive, a help and an 
inspiration, sound of faculty, and still answer- 
ing to Lander's description written in Florence 
as long ago as 1846 : 

" Since Chaucer was alive and hale, 
No man hath walk'd along our roads with step 
So active, so inquiring eye, or tongue 
So varied in discourse." 

And as we think of that powerful personality, 
so recently a real presence among us, we are 
impelled to echo the question put by Matthew 
Arnold concerning the spirit of his father: 
" O strong soul, by what shore 
Tarriest thou now ? For that force, 
Surely, has not been left vain! 
Somewhere, surely, afar, 
In the sounding labor-house vast 
Of being, is practised that strength, 
Zealous, beneficent, firm! " 

If there be in the cosmic scheme such a thing 
as the conservation of spiritual energy, the heat 
and light which had their source in Browning's 
brain must be forces with which the world will 
long have to reckon. 

And yet how ruthlessly the products of a man's 
intellect are consigned to the rubbish-heap after 
his body is laid in the grave ! How quickly is the 
grain winnowed from the chaff, and the precious 
metal "cradled" from the detritus! The small 
volume of selections from Browning's poems, put 
forth by his publishers while he was still alive, 
and sold for a shilling, has for more than a score 
of years served nearly all our purposes for quota- 
tion and reference, while several complete editions 
have stood almost untouched on the neighboring 
shelves, the dust collecting upon them in eloquent 
testimony to the vanity of a great poetical ambi- 
tion . Who now is eager to explore, or ever will 
be again, the secrets of Red-Cotton-Nightcap 
Country, or to read of Pacchiarotto, how he 
worked in distemper ? " Sordello " may now and 
again find a curious investigator (who will by no 
means go unrewarded), and " The Ring and the 
Book" provide intellectual gymnastics for a few 
students here and there, or furnish them with 
material for academic theses upon poetical crafts- 
manship ; but the vast bulk of Browning's work 



THE DIAL 



[May 16, 



has been withdrawn from general circulation, 
and appeals only to the ever-lessening inner circle 
of his adepts. The shilling volume, however, or 
some similar anthology, will remain a constant 
companion of all who love poetry, and they will 
hold it precious beyond most of the treasures 
brought back from their various journeyings in 
the realms of gold. 

We imagine that Browning's second cente- 
nary will awaken more interest than his first. I f 
the world cares for poetry at all in the year 2012, 
it will look back upon the Victorian age much 
as we now look back upon the Elizabethan, and 
will realize, more fully than we who have been 
of it can realize, how fine a flowering of the hu- 
man spirit it witnessed. It will see our poets in 
better perspective than we can see them, and it 
will do them more even justice. It will be able 
to envisage Browning, not as the object of a 
special cult, and, as such, open to suspicion, but 
as a great buoyant human figure, having its frail- 
ties and imperfections, but working with deep 
insight and whole-souled sympathy at the task 
of expressing life. It will not delude itself with 
the notion that his rugged style and cacophonous 
phrasing were the marks of a genius too lofty 
to be trammelled by the rules of art, nor will it 
so overestimate his powers of thought as to think 
they justified his impatience of formal restraint ; 
it will see that he was not so much an intellectual 
as an emotional force, and it will recognize as 
unfortunate the fact that his superb energy was 
permitted to display itself in so undisciplined a 
fashion. When it compares him with Tennyson, 
as it inevitably must, it will see that the elder 
poet not only outdistanced him in the command 
of artistic expression but was more than his match 
in the power of philosophical thought. 

But this is not the occasion for a critical esti- 
mate of Browning, or for invidious comparisons, 
or for any form of dispraise. When a great 
man's anniversary comes around, our prevailing 
impulse is to join in reverent thanksgiving for 
his services to mankind, and to express our 
gratitude for his gifts. And this poet had a 
power not possessed by many of his fellow- 
craftsmen to draw men's hearts to him, and 
make them feel that his words were only a 
heightened form of their common speech. He 
asserted, moreover, with all the emphasis at his 
command, the validity of passion, which is a 
more acceptable gospel to average humanity than 
the precepts of renunciation and asceticism. One 
could always go to him with the assurance of 
getting counsel that was kindly, sympathetic, 
and helpful. And men will always be grateful 



to one whose outlook is cheerful, who raises them 
out of their dej*|xmUnt moods, and who insists 
in and out of season that ik all 's ri^ht with the 
world," however questionable that proposition 
may actually be. 

CASUAL COMMENT. 

THE PROCEEDS OF THE HOE BOOK-SALES at which 
parts one, two, and three of the late Robert Hoe's 
splendid collection passed under the auctioneer's 
hammer and became the property of the highest hid- 
den, are now (at the close of the sale of part three) 
found to be more than a million and a half dollars, 
or, in precise figures, $1,669,132.75. One more 
part, and perhaps two, will be disposed of next sea- 
son, these unsold portions including the valuable 
reference library used by Mr. Hoe in getting together 
his vast collection of literary treasures and objects 
of art As illustrating the more or less whimsical 
predilections of bibliophiles, some of the prices paid 
in the last days of the sale recently closed are sig- 
nificant. For example, Whitfield's tract, "The 
Light Appearing More and More," brought five 
hundred dollars, while an edition of Tasso's " Gerusa- 
1 cm me Liberate" ( Paris, 177 1), with plates by Grave- 
lot, went as an unconsidered trifle for seventeen 
dollars and fifty cents ; and even a copy of the first 
Aldine edition of Terence (Venice, 1517), printed 
on vellum, and described as "the only one known," 
failed by nearly two hundred dollars to reach the 
price paid for the Whitfield tract. The first edi- 
tion of Oscar Wilde's " Picture of Dorian Gray " 
(a presentation copy) sold for one hundred dollars; 
while Sir Kenelm Digby's copy of Tacitus's "An- 
nals," with Sir Kenelm's arms and autograph, was 
knocked down at fifteen dollars. 



"EVERYMAN'S LIBRARY" AS A TRAVELLING 
LIBRARY possesses merits that the Iowa Library 
Commission and other committees and individuals 
have not been slow to recognize. The recent issue 
of a dictionary catalogue of the first five hundred 
volumes of this admirable as well as inexpensive 
collection of standard works has greatly facilitated 
its use for such purposes as that indicated above. 
The books may be bought in reinforced cloth bind- 
ing, and, with one or more copies of the publishers' 
printed catalogue to accompany each set, no more 
readily serviceable travelling library could be de- 
vised. The smallness and flexibility of the volumes, 
with their good print and authoritative editorship 
and prefaces, peculiarly fit them for use in "t la- 
people's university." Expert assistance has evi- 
dently been employed by the publishers in preparing 
their catalogue. Miss Isabella M. Cooper, formerly 
instructor in the Iowa Summer Library School, and 
now teacher of library science at Simmons College, 
was one of the compilers, and Miss Margaret A. 
Me Vety, of the Newark Public Library, collaborated 
with her. Study clubs, book clubs, small libr;i

and large ones, too, for that matter, might spend 
their money far less wisely than in purchasing a 
complete " Everyman's Library." The Iowa Library 
Commission, as we started to say, buys the volumes 
in reinforced bindings and sends them out in the 
travelling library boxes, with the publishers' ready- 
made catalogue, to carry sweetness and light to the 
rural solitudes. 

THE SHAKESPEAREAN LIBRARY OF A SHAKE- 
SPEAREAN SCHOLAR, especially rich in the texts and 
commentaries which the editor of a variorum edition 
of the poet's works must have at his elbow, and 
housed in so substantial a manner as to fear nothing 
from fire or burglary such is the famous collection 
got together in half a century of Shakespeare study 
and editorship by Dr. Horace Howard Furness, of 
Philadelphia. The room holding this precious de- 
posit forms a wing of the Furness homestead at Wal- 
lingford, on the outskirts of the city, and its access 
from the body of the house is guarded by iron doors 
concealed in the thickness of the walls, but ready to 
be drawn out on their wheels and runways at a mo- 
ment's notice. The walls of the library are of brick 
and iron, the floor is laid on cement, and a thick layer 
of asbestos intervenes between the ceiling and the 
roof. These safeguards will not seem excessive when 
it is remembered that this collection of Shakespear- 
eana is probably the second finest in the world, its 
only rival being the memorial library of the poet's 
birthplace. Dr. Furness's long connection, as trustee, 
with the semi-public library founded by Franklin 
(the Library Company of Philadelphia) speaks for 
his expert knowledge of the care of such a collection 
as his own, which is really a museum as well as a 
library, and is by no means confined in its range of 
literature to works by or about the Stratford poet. 
That it will pass on its owner's death into hands sure 
to care for it tenderly will not be doubted by those 
who know of the younger Horace Howard Furness's 
cooperation with his father in the completion of the 
famous variorum edition of Shakespeare designed 
and begun by the elder scholar. 


BATH'S TRIBUTE TO JANE AUSTEN, in the form of 
a bronze portrait bust in the pump-room, on a richly 
decorated pedestal of jasper, with an inscription com- 
memorating the admirable pictures of old Bath life 
and manners to be found in her novels, is both de- 
served and appropriate. In "Northanger Abbey" 
and " Persuasion " the reader gets especially pleasing 
glimpses of the famous watering-place as it was in 
Miss Austen's day. Many will remember the earlier 
chapters of "Northanger Abbey " as containing fre- 
quent references to the Pump-room (always capital- 
ized), the Pump-yard, the Upper Rooms, and the 
Lower Rooms, where all the transitory Bath world 
of fashion was to be seen. In the opening of chapter 
four, for example, one recalls this passage: "With 
more than usual eagerness did Catherine hasten to 
the Pump-room the next day, secure within herself 
of seeing Mr. Tilney there before the morning was 



over, and ready to meet him with a smile; but no 
smile was demanded, Mr. Tilney did not appear," 
though everyone else did, in the constant procession 
of comers and goers, as Catherine sat and waited 
near the great clock, after walking the room till she 
was tired. Miss Austen's bust will henceforth fur- 
nish an additional motive for visiting the famous 
Pump-room. ... 

A CITY'S PROPORTION OF LIBRARY-USERS, as com- 
pared with the total population, is for obvious reasons 
hard to determine ; but registration and census figures 
sometimes furnish a little help in making the com- 
putation. Of course every loyal librarian wishes to 
make the best possible showing in this respect, and 
for this as well as other reasons the registration sta- 
tistics may be not quite guiltless of including dor- 
mant or totally defunct card-holders in the annual 
summing-up. However that may be, it is gratifying 
to note in the Leavenworth Public Library Report 
for the year 1911 a registration indicating that about 
one person in every five of the city's population holds 
(and presumably uses to some extent) a library card. 
And Leavenworth's library is only twelve years old, 
but has in its brief history accumulated nearly twenty 
thousand volumes, on the strength of a rather meagre 
annual appropriation for books. Going east to Bos- 
ton and its far-famed public library, we find only 
about one person in seven drawing books. In Jersey 
City the proportion works out, from available figures, 
as one in four. Springfield, Mass., furnishes a 
record seemingly too good to be true, one in three. 
In the South, Atlanta appears to enjoy the possession 
of a remarkable book-reading population, about one 
person in every four being a card-holder, unless the 
figures prevaricate. Nearer home, Peoria claims one 
card-holder to every six inhabitants, which is credit- 
able and also within the bounds of probability. But 
statistics have long had a bad reputation, and we will 
not here cultivate their further acquaintance.

PAGES FROM THE LIFE OF A WANDERING WORK- 
INGMAN, namely, Mr. James O. Fagan, well known 
for his " Confessions of a Railroad Signalman " and 
his " Labor and the Railroads," will constitute a very 
readable part of "The Atlantic Monthly" for some 
months to come. The May number begins this 
"Autobiography of an Individualist," as the author 
entitles his life-story, and sees the Scottish youth as 
far on his wanderings as South America, whither 
he goes in the service of a newly-organized cable 
company. But more interesting than this cable en- 
terprise is Mr. Fagan's account of his early educa- 
tion, religious and secular. Mr. Brown, Free Kirk 
minister, was the one to take in hand his instruc- 
tion in godly learning. "One day, coming across 
the expression, 'The Scarlet Woman,' I asked Mr. 
Brown to explain it to me. I remember his answer: 
' My boy, at your age curiosity will do you a great 
deal more harm than enlightenment will do you 
good. Study the Paradise Lost and beware of the 
popular craving for the novels of Dickens.' " Inver-

THE BUSIEST PUBLIC LIBRARY IN THE COUNTRY, 

with reference to the number of volumes circulated 
from a single building, appears to be that of Buffalo. 
The librarian, Mr. Walter L. Brown, says in his 
current Report that " while every department in the 
Main Library has shown a falling off in the number 
of books circulated, the total is still the largest number 
of books that is sent out from any library building 
in the country." But no unseemly pride is mani- 
fested by the author of this statement Rather is it 
felt as a reproach to the prosperous city of Buffalo 
that it should have provided so few branch libraries 
as to compel most of its book-borrowing citizens to 
go long distances for their reading matter. Outside 
distributing agencies are being established, so that 
in the last three years the circulation from the main 
building has diminished by about one hundred thou- 
sand volumes, and of this decrease nine-tenths was 
fiction. We learn, in this connection, that the real 
property of the Jubilee Water System is in process 
of being converted into cash, one-half of which is 
to be used in buying a tract of land and erect- 
ing thereou a building for public library purposes. 
When this is effected there should be jubilation in 
Black Rock, the quarter of the city to receive the 
benefit of the transaction. 



THE THREE DUMAS, Dumas pere, Dumas fil$, 
and Dumas grandpere, present a rather interesting 
study in heredity. The grandfather, the valiant 
Mestizo general, born in San Domingo of a French 
father and a native half-breed mother, needed only 
to have come into the world twenty years later to 
become one of Napoleon's most famous lieutenants. 
Even as it was, he became a brigadier-general before 
he was thirty, after marvellous exploits not inferior 
to those of his son's Three Musketeers. His escape 
from an ambuscade of sixty Tyrolese, thirteen of 
whom he actually drove to his own camp as prisoners, 
was an adventure worthy of the father of the gifted 
romancer. A statue of this man who lived his ro- 
mances instead of writing them is about to be erected 
in the Place Malesherbes, Paris, beside those of his 
son and grandson, and it is fitly suggested that the 
distinguished trio give their name to the square and 
cause it to be called henceforth the Place des trois 
Dumas. 

KENTUCKY'S NEW LIBRARY COMMISSION has 
issued its "First Biennial Report," a well-printed, 
well-illustrated pamphlet of fifty-five pages, present- 
ing succinctly the history of library organization and 
library laws in the Blue-Grass State, the number and 
condition of its existing public libraries, the purpose 
of the commission and its work, with other related 
matter. Statistical tables at the end give a list of 
thirty-one public libraries, of which thirteen are more 
or less indebted to Mr. Carnegie's generosity, and also 



a list of twelve other libraries, including the State 
Library and various college and school libraries, two 
of them beneficiaries of the millionaire ironmaster. 
The Kentucky Library Commission was created by a 
legislative enactment that took effect June 13, 1910, 
and credit for this none too prompt legislation is to be 
largely given to the Kentucky Federation of Women's 
Clubs. By organizing a system of travelling libraries 
covering thirty-two counties, these pul>lic->j>irited 
women created so urgent a demand for books and 
aroused such an interest in library extension that the 
passage of a library commission bill became, sooner 
or later, inevitable. . . . 

THE CLUE TO BROWNING'S MIND, asserts Dr. 
Henry van Dyke in a timely contribution to the 
Boston "Transcript," "is a vivid and inexhaustible 
curiosity, dominated by a strangely steady optimism." 
And further: "It is a mistake to say that Brown- 
ing is a metaphysician : he is a psychologist." This 
well expresses the strength and the weakness of the 
author of " Sordello." If ever a poet had the 
defects of his qualities defects which to some 
impatient readers seem to overshadow the qualities 
that poet is Browning. Psychological subtleties with 
difficulty lend themselves to the service of verse that 
sings itself into the heart and soul of the hearer. 
Versified psychology^ from the gifted pen of a 
Browning, must be called poetry, indeed, rather 
than (in Pope's phrase) prose run mad, but it is 
surely a poetry sui generis, not the " simple, sensu- 
ous, and passionate " thing referred to by Milton as 
being "less suttle and fine" than rhetoric. 



THE "SUFFRAGETTE" IN ANCIENT GREECE 
appears to have made her presence known as 
early as 392 B.C., the date of the performance of 
Aristophanes's comedy, " Ecclesiazusie," or, as 
one might freely render it in English, "The Female 
Suffragists," or "The Women in Town-Meeting." 
This laughable picture of a feminized republic 
should be just now the timeliest sort of play for 
amateur presentation on the part of young ladies' 
dramatic associations. A recent meeting of the 
classical and archaeological clubs of Mount Holyoke 
College was enlivened by the performance of this 
comedy by members of the senior and junior classes, 
under the direction of Dr. Mary G. Williams, the 
professor of Greek. So successful was this Aris- 
tophanic revival that the project is now favorably 
considered of producing a Greek play every year. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 

THE APPEAL OF THE " BEST SELLER." 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Reading recently Mr. II. <i. Wells's opinions upon 
" The Contemporary Novel," I was struck by his flat- 
tering pronouncement that "women have never quite 
succumbed to the Weary Giant attitude in their reading. 
. . . Among readers, women, girls, and young men at 
least insist upon having their novels significant and real." 
I wondered if Mr. Wells was thinking only of his well- 



1912.] 



THE DIAL

informed country women, with their alertness to current 
affairs; or may we, the "women and girls " of America, 
fairly take to ourselves a share of the compliment ? 
Reluctantly I doubted our share in it. To solve my 
doubts, I sought to test the question by my class of 
undergraduate women. 

Asking what recent novels the students felt were of 
permanent value, I received an earnest endorsement of 
one of the recent "Best-Sellers." Inquiry as to the 
essential qualities of this novel called forth answers 
interestingly similar to Mr. Wells's opinions : it was the 
characterization, and the importance of the problem, 
with, in this case, an additional interest in scene, or 
"descriptions" which marked the novel's distinctive 
value and claim to immortality. A belligerent but hope- 
less minority, however, caused me to accept the verdict 
with reservations, and drove me to a Sunday's perusal 
of the book. The reading brought to me an interesting 
revelation of the nature of the attraction in the " Best 
Seller." 

This one was a novel with the realistic interest of the 
present time, and the romantic charm of a remote place. 
In a story of western life, the author was apparently try- 
ing to do for the American Desert what Thomas Hardy 
had done for Egdon Heath ; comparison showed striking 
similarities in intention, with vastly different results ! 
Yet my students, feeling the intention, perceiving the 
amount of space given to crudely colored atmospheric 
descriptive passages, had not stopped to judge results. 
Though they felt that the book contained "beautiful 
descriptions," it is possible that they skipped most of 
them, for one can scarcely conceive what contribution 
to interest or understanding they could have found in so 
meaningless a sentence as, for example, this: "And the 
desert, receiving that flood from the wide hot sky, mys- 
teriously wove with it soft scarfs of lilac, misty veils of 
purple, and filmy curtains of rose and pearl and gold; 
strangely formed with it wide lakes of blue rimmed with 
phantom hills of red and violet constantly changing, 
shifting, scene on scene, as dream pictures shift and 
change." A plot made up of conventional situations of 
love and valor, with the climax centering around the 
well-worn theme of concealed identity; characters, un- 
realized, playing their familiar roles like stage heroes 
and villains of an ancient type, decked out with modern 
accoutrements and the specific paraphernalia of the 
western plains ; the style, a fearful abuse of the English 
language, alternating between a conscious straining for 
elevated effects, and an unconscious progress along the 
deadest levels of colloquialism, were these the ele- 
ments in the novel which won from young women of 
average educational training their interest and applause? 

Feeling personally sensitive about the nature of that 
training, I comfort myself by believing that these ele- 
ments in themselves could not have been pleasing had 
they been observed ; but that in truth neither character- 
ization, plot, nor description per se was the real object 
of interest. The book as a whole presented the strong, 
crude coloring and rapid action of the melodrama of an 
up-town theatre; or perhaps its breathless vividness 
might be aptly compared to the technique of a moving- 
picture show. And therein lay its power, in the vivid- 
ness of the human appeal, in the portrayal of the 
elemental human passions, the simple compelling strug- 
gles of the spirit with self and circumstance. This 
human struggle swept along from one intense moment 
to another, accelerating the emotional reaction of the 
susceptible reader, bya grand crescendo of melodramatic 



incident equally remote in simplicity and in vividness 
from the dull drab complexity of real life. 6** y 

It is undeniable that these pictures of the lure of the 
beautiful, the power of the good, and the triumph of 
the strong appeal to the unjaded idealism of our uncrit- 
ical reading public, particularly "women, girls, and 
young men." We are so constructed, thank Heaven! 
as to be easily moved by love, suffering, self-sacrifice, 
and the struggle of the tempted; but so ready are we 
to give sympathetic applause to any expression of our 
ideals, that a poor story, harping stridently upon these 
themes, will rouse our interest and carry us along, ob- 
livious to the lack of truth to life in all other elements 
of the story, and unmindful of the feeble artistry of the 
story-teller. 

Perhaps, after all, then, this surrender to the Best- 
Seller does not prove Mr. Wells's " Weary Giant" theory 
as applicable to women; my students' adolescent inter- 
est in love and valor does not indicate "that lounging 
defensive stupidity" which Mr. Wells condemns. May 
it not rather be an evidence of his other statement that 
women and girls insist upon having their novels " sig- 
nificant " at least; and if they do not demand a signifi- 
cance closely bound to reality, may it not be that, to 
many of them, life has not yet brought the sense of the 
close relationship between the significant, the real, and 
the ideal? HELEN SARD HUGHES.

THE IRISH TEXTS SOCIETY IN AMERICA. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Readers of THE DIAL may be interested in the organ- 
ization of an American Council of the Irish Texts 
Society. This Society was founded in 1898 in London, 
and has since published every year some Irish book 
which is otherwise difficult or impossible to obtain. The 
object of the American Council is to strengthen the 
work of the Society, and to secure additional members 
in this country. Members pay two dollars a year, and 
are entitled to receive the annual volume. The thir- 
teen volumes thus far issued are handsome books, hav- 
ing a Gaelic text and a complete English translation on 
opposite pages. The books have been selected chiefly 
from the seventeenth century and onward, and afford 
English as well as Gaelic readers access to the genuine 
products of the Celtic mind at a time when it expressed 
itself naturally in the language in which the main body 
of Celtic literature is composed. A large number of 
MSS. of this period exists, but many of them are of 
frail paper and in private hands, and are liable at any 
time to be destroyed. Irish thought and its influence 
on English thought cannot be fully understood until 
these materials are printed and made accessible. 

The American Council, which at present has its 
headquarters in Chicago, consists of the following: Hon. 
W. J. Onahan, Chicago, Chairman; Very Reverend John 
Cavanaugh, C. S. C., President Notre Dame University; 
Professor Cross, Sweet Briar College, Va. ; Dr. Wm. 
Dillon, Chicago; Professor Dunn, Catholic University, 
Washington, D.C. ; Professor Gayley, University of 
California; Professor Nitze, University of Chicago; 
Michael O'Gallagher, Chicago ; Dr. Thos. O'Hagan, 
Editor " New World," Chicago; Hon. John Quinn, New 
York; Professor Robinson, Harvard University; Rt. 
Rev'd Mgr. Shahan, Catholic University, Washington; 
D. B. Twomey, President Gaelic League of Chicago.

i \ i ; i . \ MEMORIES OF AN ILLUSTRIOUS 
IRISHMAN.* 

Justin McCarthy's volume of " Irish Recol- 
lections " makes its appearance almost simultane- 
ously with his death at the age of eighty-one 
years and five months, and helps to give some- 
thing like completeness to the autobiographical 
series comprising his "Irishman's Story" and 
his two volumes of "Reminiscences." 

Born at Cork, November 22, 1830, the son of 
Michael Francis McCarthy, chief clerk to the 
local magistrates, the future parliamentarian 
and historian of his own times was debarred by 
the then existing restrictions imposed upon Ro- 
man Catholics from certain educational and other 
privileges that he would have liked to enjoy. 
Private instruction and miscellaneous reading 
seem to have constituted his education after the 
first school of his boyhood was left behind ; then 
came, at the age of eighteen, his entrance upon 
journalism, a calling pursued by him success- 
ively, and successfully, in Cork, Liverpool, and 
London. After serving " The Morning Star," 
of London, as parliamentary reporter for a few 
years, he became editor of that journal in 1864, 
and held the position until 1868, when he yielded 
to a desire to visit this country and made the first 
of those three lecture tours which gave him so 
familiar an acquaintance with America. His 
two other visits were in 1870-71 and 1886-87. 
He became a leader-writer to the London " Daily 
News " in 1870, and entered Parliament as mem- 
ber for County Longford in 1879. He was re- 
turned by North Longford in 1885, by London- 
derry in 1886, and by North Longford again in 
1892, closing his parliamentary service in 1900. 
As is well known, he was a Liberal in politics, 
and a Home Ruler, and held the chairmanship 
of the Irish Parliamentary Party from 1890 to 
1896, though he could hardly be regarded as the 
political leader of that party, his bent being far 
more literary than political. His Nationalism 
was of a temperate and orderly kind, and it was 
probably his distinction as a writer and public 
speaker that brought him into prominence in 
the councils of his party. 

This brief account of his life and work, 
prompted by his recent death, would lack com- 
pleteness even as a summary outline without men- 
tion of his contributions to literature. His most 
considerable work, "A History of Our Own 

IRISH RECOLLECTIONS. By Justin McCarthy. Illus- 
trated. New York : George H. Doran Co. 



Times," in five volumes, is really a history of Kn- 
gland in our own times (from Queen Victoria's 
accession to her diamond jubiW j. and is an able 
and interesting piece of narrative writing front 
the Liberal standpoint. His history of the reigns 
of the first four Georges and of William the 
Fourth, the latter half of which was written by 
his son, and his " Reign of Queen Anne," with 
his biographies of Peel, Gladstone, and Pope Leo 
XIII., his " England in the Nineteenth Cen- 
tury," "The Epoch of Reform," "British Polit- 
ical Portraits," and " Modern Leaders," about 
complete the list of his more serious and scholarly 
works. In rather lighter vein are his " Kniiini- 
cences" and "An Irishman's Story," already 
mentioned, "From Charing Cross to St. Paul's," 
and "Portraits of the Sixties," and, finally, the 
" Irish Recollections " now fresh from the press. 
As a novelist, Mr. McCarthy has written rather 
copiously and always with a graceful facility and 
a ready fund of invention. His pictures of society 
life are produced with something like Trollope's 
unfailing ease, and, like Trollope's Barchester 
portraits, they have brought gratifying monetary 
returns without lifting their author to the pin- 
nacle of fame. Among his best-known novels 
are " The Comet of a Season," " The Waterdale 
Neighbours," "Red Diamonds," "Miss Misan- 
thrope," " A Fair Saxon,"" Dear Lady Disdain," 
"Donna Quixote," "Maid of Athens," "The 
Dictator," and "Mononia." These and other 
stories of his present the passing show of human- 
ity as viewed by a good-humored on-looker who 
has no intention of boring his readers with phil- 
osophical abstractions, moral reflections, or the 
niceties of psychological analysis. 

Coming now to the final work of this unus- 
ually productive writer, we find it composed of 
a dozen chapters of such more vivid or more 
fondly-cherished recollections of boyhood and 
youth as not unnaturally occupy the mind of 
one preparing, in ripe old age, to bid farewell 
to the warm precincts of the cheerful day. Cork 
ways and Cork characters, with many a pleas- 
ing glimpse of the writer's family circle in the 
old home at the southern extremity of the city. 
and with considerable disquisition on Irish traits 
in general, make up the substance of the book. 
Incidentally something of politics, of Irish his- 
tory, of economic conditions in Ireland, and of 
the manifold benefits to accrue from Home Rule, 
is woven into the texture of the various chapters. 
The claims of Cork, too, as a seat of literary 
culture and connoisseurship in art are agreeably 
voiced by the writer. Probably hundreds of 
others would loyally assert of their native towns 



1912.] 



THE DIAL 



389 



what Mr. McCarthy takes pride in saying of 
his birthplace; but it is none the less worth 
quoting. 

" I have seen many countries since those days of my 
youth in Cork City, but I have never been in any place 
where the love of literature was more warm, more sin- 
cere, and more general than in that community amid 
which I was brought up. I have sometimes felt tempted 
to describe my native city as another Weimar, but then 
I have always remembered that it had no Goethe and 
no Schiller, and that fact would certainly suggest to 
the minds of my listeners a considerable difference be- 
tween the two towns. However, I venture on making 
the remark here, because it will in itself be to the credit 
of my Cork abode that anyone could even for a moment 
have thought of venturing on such a comparison." 

He questions whether in England itself such 
authors as Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, Mil- 
ton, Scott, Dickens, and Thackeray had a larger 
proportion of enthusiastic admirers than in Ire- 
land ; and with something of the large charity 
that marks his reflections on the English people 
in general, he .adds : 

" I feel quite sure that such appreciation and admira- 
tion of great English authors helped us much towards 
a recognition of the fact that England's ill-treatment of 
Ireland was the work mainly of England's privileged 
and ruling classes, and not in any sense of the English 
as a people." 

Every member of the author's social circle in 
those golden days seems to have been something 
of a poet and romancer, as well as a musician 
and a person of polite accomplishments gener- 
ally. But these instances of early promise 
somehow failed in the end to result in any 
uncomfortable congestion on the heights of Par- 
nassus. Some few modest contributions to news- 
paper verse, and perhaps a few volumes of 
creditable prose, were commonly the utmost 
outcome of such proudly confident assumption 
of the literary role. Of course the author of 
the "Eecollections " had his fling, with the rest, 
as a composer of rhymes. Possibly the reason 
why he did not ultimately become famous as a 
poet may be discovered in the following stanza 
from his " Poor Charlie Gray," an effusion com- 
memorating the melancholy fate of a boyhood 
friend, and printed in full by Mr. McCarthy 
for the entertainment of his readers : 

"Poor Charlie Gray! The heavy tears 

Fell from these lids, I must acknowledge; 
I knew him well in earlier years, 

And we were steady friends at college. 
We parted when I met him here 

He had grown yellow, thin, despondent, 
A Garibaldian volunteer, 

And I a Special Correspondent." 

It is interesting to note, from specimens of 



his father's verse reproduced by Mr. McCarthy, 
how much more of a poet the magistrate's clerk 
was than the future novelist and historian. It 
had been Michael McCarthy's early ambition to 
become a barrister, but the vexatious restrictions 
imposed upon those of his faith seeking admis- 
sion to the bar rendered the gratification of his 
desire too difficult and too costly. But nothing 
could quench his passion for the best literature, 
especially Greek literature. His son says of 
him: 

" He was a man of highly cultured literary tastes, a 
very accomplished Greek and Latin scholar, and espe- 
cially given to the study of Greek. I have heard him 
say more than once that on some occasions, when alone 
and not occupied by any thoughts of official work, he 
found himself almost coming to think in Greek. He 
was a great lover of English literature, and especially 
of that which belonged to his own time." 

Among the famous Irishmen of the author's 
youth, or a little earlier, of whom he gives rem- 
iniscences, at first or second hand, are to be noted 
Thomas Moore, Daniel O'Connell, Isaac Butt, 
Thomas Crosbie, John Mitchell, Sir John Pope 
Hennessy, and Father Matthew. These and 
other names of national celebrity furnish the 
writer occasion, now and then, to consider the 
political and social and economic conditions of 
his native country, and to dwell on some of the 
more glaring instances of unwise administration 
of her affairs. In a chapter lauding the many 
good qualities of the sons and daughters of Erin, 
he writes : 

"I have met with many and many an Englishman in 
Ireland during the early fifties, who expressed to me his 
perfect amazement at the fatuity with which English 
statesmen, accepted as qualified makers of laws, could 
have persisted so long in the maintenance of penal codes 
and religious disqualification for a country like Ireland, 
which could have been so easily ruled and made so peace- 
ful, prosperous, and happy by a system of civil and relig- 
ious equality for all orders and denominations and classes. 
I always remember, with much satisfaction, how many 
Englishmen I used to know in those far-off days who 
had become from their own observation and experience 
convinced believers in the principle that Ireland's one 
great want was merely such an enlightened system of 
government as England and Scotland and Wales were 
then enjoying." 

The book as a whole is of the richly reminis- 
cent, kindly, mellow, anecdotal, wisely reflective 
sort that might have been expected, and was 
certainly desired, from its octogenarian author. 
Our earliest memories are our fondest ones in 
old age, and over these recollections of his life's 
beginning Mr. McCarthy has delighted to linger 
as that life drew to its close.

X I itEASURK-lloi -K OF GERMAN 
POETKY.* 



ft The "Oxford Book of German Verse" 
worthily supplements its English, French, and 
Italian predecessors in the same compact and 
dignified series. The whole work breathes that 
distinction which is academic " in the best 
sense. It offers a considerable volume of lyric 
verse: 536 selections, covering 532 pages of 
thin but opaque paper. Professor Fiedler has 
a fine sense of the typical and significant ; and 
if all the numbers be not " household words," 
they have all some meaning and place in this 
anthology. The editor has happily liberated 
himself from that super-discreet timidity which 
so often inhibits freedom of choice in British 
collections. 

It is most gratifying to bear witness to Pro- 
fessor Fiedler's careful and scholarly piety 
toward the texts. a trust which many com- 
pilers of popular anthologies have treated with 
an almost criminal levity. The plan is chrono- 
logical, and the grouping is entirely by authors. 
We have a fair view of some eight centuries of 
varied poetry, from "Him of Kurenberg" to 
Richard Schaukal, presenting a large variety 
of backgrounds, epochs, and colorings. The 
poems of the Middle High German period have 
been felicitiously rendered into modern verse by 
Dr. Fiedler. The excerpts from the great treas- 
ury of the German Volkslied, from different 
periods, are fresh and typical of its many-sided 
content ; nor must we omit mention of the race- 
old gnomic verse, of which German poetry pre- 
serves a much larger store than our own, 
represented by many names, from Freidank to 
Heyse, and including Logau, Goethe, Schiller, 
Kiickert, Hebbel, and Geibel. 

The compact notes, covering forty-five pages, 
are all in German in fact the only English 
about the book is found in the title on the out- 
side cover. Professor Fiedler's residence and 
labors at the centre of English civilization have 
fitted him to supply just such brief comments 
as are most needed by cultivated English- 
speaking readers. Much general intelligence 
is assumed : the book is no vade-mecum for 
analphabetes. The notes are concerned with 
sources, occasions of writing, and the explana- 
tion of difficult matters of detail, while especial 
place is given to musical compositions (only three 
are mentioned for the Lorelei J ). An occasional

metrical note upon exotic lyric forms would have 
proved helpful even to cultured readers. 

One naturally compares this collection with 
Professor Manly 's admirable anthology of " Kn- 
glish Poetry," which covers almost precisely the 
same period of time. The Oxford Book holds 
not more than one-third the material, but it 
surpasses the " English Poetry " in tastefulness 
and grace of form. It contains by no means so 
large a proportion of "winged words," which 
is in itself a strong testimony to the force and 
constancy of English poetic tradition. We are, 
however, very forcibly struck by the compara- 
tive crudity of English poetry before Chaucer, 
by its deadly saturation with sterile theology; 
while the lyric sun of mediaeval Germany is at 
its glorious zenith in the thirteenth century: 
what spontaneity, eloquence, grace, heartiness, 
depth of meaning, intensity of feeling! What 
brave brocade of chivalry, what flowers of fairy 
fancy! In Tudor times the tables are turned, 
for Germany, long since settled down to a 
deadly bourgeois level, is torn by doctrinal and 
political cataclysms ; while England, in joyful 
ebullience, is warbling native wood-notes wild, 
soon to be succeeded by the exuberant outburst 
of the full renaissance under Elizabeth, with its 
sweeping plenitude of life, its noble eloquence, 
and its grandiose sense of form a period whu-h 
fixed our English ars poetica upon a base which 
has never been removed, in spice of the stiffening 
of verse into rigid classicism, and the conformity 
of art to the demands of polite society. 

Fortunately for Germany, the Volkslieder, 
those fresh flowers of nature, continued to 
blossom in humble places. The Renaissance 
came late, and to a poorly-prepared soil. There 
was a painful lack of noble content to life : war, 
vulgar luxury, pompous orthodoxy, the decline 
of spirituality and native feeling these com- 
bined to bring in the most barren period of mod- 
ern German letters. The French mode, itself 
artificial and sophisticated, led to an aridly self- 
conscious art, in the midst of which a few true 
native tones assert themselves in the heart in.- 
of Dach, the heart-felt piety of Gerhardt, the 
searching wit of Logau. First in the unhappy 
Giinther do we discover the assertion of a simple, 
glowing passionateness ; the great birth of Ger- 
man poetry begins with the rediscovery of the 
quickening value of ancient art, the first-hand 
understanding of the essentially religious import 
of letters to the Greeks. From this soil of a 
sincere study of classical antiquity sprang the 
revival which led directly to Goethe, into whom 
entered those myriad elements that made him

the height of modern letters: noble eloquence, 
clarity, sincerity, mastery of form and content ; 
and Schiller, rhetorical, full of energy and motion 
and youthful eloquence, the untiring student of 
philosophy and antiquity. Then comes the chap- 
ter of German romanticism, with its background 
of castle, forest, and legend ; Uhland and Eichen- 
dorff , the highly- wrought delicacy of Holderlin, 
Riickert's wealth of thought and language, 
Miiller's pure lyric and gift of dramatic person- 
ification, Heine's ironic melody and sensitive 
responsiveness, Lenau's reserved melancholy, 
Morike's Attic distinction, Geibel's serenity and 
culture, Meyer's grandiose depth, and the rest, 
down to the representative verse of our own 
times, noticeable for its fastidiousness and its 
implacable craving for the gratification of the 
senses. 

All of this, and much beside, is faithfully illus- 
trated in this well-chosen treasury of German 
lyrics, whose fanciful, heart-felt music sings and 
charms, soothes and stirs. 

The collection opens with an appreciative in- 
troduction by Gerhart Hauptmann, Germany's 
first man of letters, the first German poet, by 
the way, who was ever given the honorary degree 
of Doctor of Letters by an English university. 
Hauptmann discovers a close resemblance be- 
tween this collection and that which Goethe 
called for in 1808, in his " Plan for a Chap-Book 
of Lyrical Verse." The hardest thing to find," 
wrote Goethe, "is the Excellent (in whatever 
field) that shall be popular at the same time. 
One should search this material out, first of all, 
and make it the foundation of such a collection." 
" The present book," Hauptmann goes on to say, 
" is ' popular and German ' in the noblest sense of both 
words. Such a truly catholic and national collection will 
make the most direct appeal to a kindred nation, and 
more particularly to that element in the nation which 
cherishes most loyally its own great stock of poetry. 

" All these flowers, culled from the gardens of many 
centuries, make their appeal not merely by their indi- 
vidual form, fragrance, and color; they fill the mind with 
visions of bygone ages, of those broad domains out of 
which they grew, and of which they remain the last sur- 
viving witnesses; or they are linked with names of per- 
sonages, each of whom has become by himself a theme 
of never-ending interest and importance. 

" This collection, which is brought down to our own 
day, also contains more recent, and most recent examples. 
. . . Only an age which teems with a fulness of native 
energy, which grows and presses on to the light, is worthy 
of a great historic past, and is really able to take pos- 
session of it. Here it is precisely as in nature: harvest 
follows seed, and seed harvest, and all by means of the 
vital power inherent in the basal soil. . . . 

" Who should presume to make definite appraisal of 
such a fund of culture as is hoarded up in this book? 
. . . This great treasure, by its very nature, resists being 



coined. With all its reality, the very best part of such 
a collection cannot be made tangible, and least of all by 
those who have really entered into its domain. 

" As for all the rest, one can only hope that the book 
may find for its judges such warm friends as the great 
George Meredith, akin and susceptible to the German 
temperament; good spirits to whom it is given to unlock 
the inspired content of these manifold creations, to pene- 
trate to their very roots and to reach up into the atmos- 
phere which envelops them. With such sponsors, these 
children of the German soil, even though separated from 
their native earth, will not be uprooted, but in the midst 
of a kindred people will enjoy, as it were, the rights of 
those native to the soil." 

Judgment upon matters of detail in such a 
collection is almost sure to be warped by sub- 
jective presumptions, and no conceivable an- 
thology could possibly include all the poems 
which any given reader would desire to find. 
Admitting the danger of personal bias, there 
are still some considerations which may be fairly 
presented. One of Luther's simpler, more spon- 
taneous hymns (particularly Nun freut euch, 
lieben Christen g'mein) would be very wel- 
come. The scanty fragments of Giinther's 
verse do not fairly represent the forerunner of 
the modern German lyric of passion ; Klop- 
stock's An Fanny and Haller's Doris surely 
deserve a place, both for their intrinsic worth 
and for their historic interest. Some of the dry 
bones of poetry (notably, in this sense, Zed- 
litz's J\'dchtliche Heerschau), and certain of the 
feebler productions of Schiller's muse, might 
well have been spared to give place to Uhland 's 
gallant Taillefer, Heine's Ein Jungling liebt 
ein M'ddchen, and Und wiissten's die Blumen, 
die kleinen. In admitting some of the newest 
poets, whose vital air is essentially that of the 
cabaret, the editor has emphatically not reported 
that elemental atmosphere ; nor can one content- 
edly forego some representation of the Harts, 
Conradi, Busse, Hartleben, and George. 

The fine scholarly accuracy and purity of 
text displayed throughout the work are worthy 
of all praise, and make one the more regret cer- 
tain indefensible arbitrary liberties: two-thirds 
of Walther's short ffalmorakel are sacrificed, 
without any intimation, and with decided detri- 
ment to the text. The poem representing the 
work of Friedrich von Spe suffers the omission 
of a very significant title, and appears (with no 
hint to this effect) only as a fragment, in such 
a way as completely to change its essential char- 
acter; a similar result is achieved by dropping 
off (with Herder) the significant closing verses 
of Dach's Aennchen von Tharau, which Long- 
fellow had the courage to reinstate. Likewise, 
the bitter closing stanza of Chamisso's Weiber

This sort of thing may pass in merely popular

geringe in No. 271 differs only by one syllable

of the little volume, there is occasionally an 
unevenness in the printing which is a keen 
disappointment. 

Heine's reference to Goethe's Mignon in the

Schiller seems more than problematical. It 
would be most desirable, for practical reasons, 
to incorporate the titles of the poems into the 
alphabetical index of first lines. 

Most grateful thanks are due from all lovers 
of German poetry for this precious, accurate,

THE MoNTEssoui METHOD or TEACHING.* 

American newspapers and magazines have 
recently shown great interest in the Montessori 
method in education. Many writers have given 
the impression that Maria Montessori has made 
a discovery which will revolutionize the teaching 
of young children. American teachers have

gone to Koine for the purpose of observing the 
Montessori method in the Casa dei #<//// A /'///, 
and some of them have returned to their native 
land convinced that they have observed work with 
children which has never been attempted before 
in any country. These American observers have 
been describing in the magazines what they saw 
in Rome; but now we have from Madame Mon- 
tessori herself an account of her system. She 
first gives a critical discussion of the relation 
of modern science to education. She has been 
trained as a physician, and she has had a practical 
interest in anthropological studies. For some 
time she was engaged in teaching feeble-minded 
children; and while in this work she made a 
study of the methods of Seguin, Lombroso, 
Sergi, and others, all of whose work is well known 
in America. These studies prepared Madame 
Montessori for " natural " or" rational " methods 
of dealing with normal children. Wherever she 
went in her own country she saw the pupils in 
the schools sitting in hard and fast seats, learn- 
ing words, being deprived of freedom of move- 
ment, and restrained and restricted in every 
way. So she started a school of her own for poor 
children in Rome, and it was in this <"-/.></ '/< / 
Bambini that she applied her scientific knowl- 
edge of child nature to early work in education. 

The fundamental principles upon which the 
Montessori method is based are, (1) individual 
training; (2) freedom of action and of initiative 
on the part of the children; (3) the training of 
the senses; (4) physical training in connection 
with intellectual education ; and (5) social train- 
ing as a part of regular school activities. A 
special set of apparatus has been devised for 
training the senses, and for teaching reading 
and writing. This consists of dressing frames, 
color boxes, cloth boxes, and formal geometrical 
insets and designs, resembling in a way the 
Frobelian gifts, and based upon the same con- 
ception of child nature and education. 

As one reads Madame Montessori 's exposi- 
tion ef her method, one wonders why Americans 
should have become so interested in it, except 
as an evidence of new life in the educational 
work of a people whose schools have continued 
down to our own day to be almost medieval in 
character. But that any American teacher, ac- 
quainted with the history of our own methods, 
should think the Montessori system offered much 
if anything of value to us seems remarkable. In 
this country we have IODLT reeo-ni/.-.l that the 
child should take the initiative in his work, as 
far as this is possible under the limitations of 
group education. We have long been struggling 



1912.] 



THE DIAL

against the evils of education en masse, and we 
have been endeavoring to give prominence to 
individual needs. But we have been compelled 
to educate all the children; and our methods 
have been determined partly by our ideals, and 
partly by the actual conditions of free, universal 
education. 

We long ago passed the point where we 
thought there was particular value in mere 
formal sense-training with conventional objects. 
This sort of thing was in vogue years and years 
ago ; but we have progressed to the point where 
we now aim to give children sense-experience, not 
in a formal and conventional way, but in direct 
contact with the natural objects which are of in- 
terest and concern to the individual. We now 
think that the typical child who has contact with 
nature gets vastly better sense-training, even if 
wholly undirected, than he could ever get in the 
formal way adopted by the Montessori system. 
Of course, this latter method is a great improve- 
ment upon sitting in seats and learning words, 
and so it is to be praised as an advance upon 
prevailing Italian methods; but American edu- 
cation has grown through and beyond this static 
method of teaching. To illustrate with a quota- 
tion, Madame Montessori says (p. 173 ): " The 
education of the senses has, as its aim, the refine- 
ment of the differential perception of stimuli by 
means of repeated exercises." Now, modern 
American psychology maintains that the differ- 
entiation of stimuli is made possible, not through 
mere repeated stimulations, which have no sig- 
nificance, but only when the objects affording 
the stimulations are of interest to the individual, 
and in order to learn them it is necessary that 
he should discriminate the stimuli received there- 
from. He must have vital relations with them 
before he can effectively discriminate them, and 
sound teaching will always try to establish such 
relations. 

The Montessori system proposes to teach 
children to read and write at the age of four. 
In times past, American education taught the 
child in the very beginning of his school life to 
read and to write ; but through years of trial and 
struggle, we have developed a method which 
puts emphasis upon concrete and motor expe- 
rience in the first years of schooling, and defers 
reading and writing until the child is six, seven, 
or eight years old. Anyone could teach a child 
to read and to write at four if he thought it desir- 
able ; but we now think it is not wise to do so. 

In teaching reading, the Montessori method 
begins with the isolated letters, which method 
has been discarded in America for a generation. 



The Italians excel in minute, analytic work. 
In early teaching they begin with the simplest 
structural elements in everything. This used to 
be universally the method of teaching reading, 
writing, spelling, music, and the like; but in 
America we have grown through that into a 
synthetic method, in which a beginning is made 
with the largest unities which the child can 
grasp and which have definite meaning. An 
isolated letter has no meaning, and is psycho- 
logically difficult to acquire. It has been dem- 
onstrated in America time and again that a 
child can learn a word, or even a short sentence, 
when it is directly associated with content, more 
readily and economically than he can learn an 
isolated lettter. We have several volumes pre- 
senting the results of elaborate experimental 
studies in this field, but evidently Madame 
Montessori and her American representatives 
are not aware of what has been accomplished in 
this direction. 

The whole Montessori method is about where 
the American system was twenty-five years ago. 
It is a great improvement upon general Italian 
practice in Rome, but it does not give the 
American teacher a new point of view which 
will be of service to him in solving his present 
problems. Take one further illustration, a 
typical one, showing how lessons are given in 
the Montessori system : 

" Let us suppose, for example, that the teacher 
wishes to teach to a child the two colours, red and 
blue. She desires to attract the attention of the child 
to the object. She says, therefore, 'Look at this.' 
Then, in order to teach the colours, she says, showing 
him the red, ' This is red,' raising her voice a little and 
pronouncing the word ' red ' slowing and clearly ; then 
showing him the other colour, This is blue.' In order 
to make sure that the child has understood, she says to 
him, ' Give me the red,' ' Give me the blue.' Let us 
suppose that the child in following this last direction 
makes a mistake. The teacher does not repeat and does 
not insist; she smiles, gives the child a friendly caress 
and takes away the colours." 

Now, in no good American school would a 
teacher try to develop a difference between two 
colors merely by holding them up, and giving the 
names. A capable teacher here would not try 
to teach distinctions between objects of any sort 
simply by having them looked at, and attaching 
names to them. An American teacher would 
have an object used until the child gained an 
appreciation of the nature of the thing through 
what he could do with it, and how it reacted to 
his experiments with it. Then the name would 
be attached to it ; and if the child failed to make 
the right connection between name and object, 
the teacher would not leave it, but would re-

[May 16, 



present the thing to him in such a way that he 
would correct his error. It is impossible that 
a child should make progress simply by drop- 
ping a subject when he makes an error, and 
come to it again sometime in the future. 

It should be said that the book is attractively 
written; and throughout it reveals an earnest 
and intelligent seeking for natural and effective 
methods of training the young. Considering 
the practice and traditions of Madame Mon- 
tessori's environment, she has really made a 
revolutionary advance ; but if she had lived in 
America, she would be thought to be behind 
the times in advocating some of the methods 
which are presented in this volume.

XEW MEMORIALS OF MA/./IM.* 

In the retrospect of history, certain minor fig- 
ures of every age stand out with ineffaceable 
glamour, outshining often their mightiest con- 
temporaries. The saint, the martyr, the de- 
feated hero seem to speak more eloquently and 
insistently out of the past than do the states- 
man and the conqueror. Their memory is a 
heritage which posterity preserves the most zeal- 
ously from diminution or detraction ; their names 
serve always to awaken in generous natures the 
highest enthusiasm and the deepest reverence. 
Whether their actual achievement, as history 
records it, was great or little, does not greatly 
matter ; it is in what they were, and what they 
tried to do, rather than in what they did, that 
their glory lies. Among this shining company, 
Joseph Mazzini holds a conspicuous place. 

When, in 1849, the heroic but short-lived de- 
fence of the Roman Republic came to an end, 
Mazzini, the soul of the defence, and irreconcil- 
able up to the very last to the idea of surrender, 
lingered on in the captured city, almost inviting 
assassination. "One thinks of Gordon," says 
his biographer. Indeed, one thinks of Gordon 
many times in considering Mazzini 's life. In 
all the main attributes of character the two men 
were greatly alike; the hero soul in its most 
authentic aspects was common to both. In each 
a deep religious faith was the well-spring of ac- 
tion ; they were both men of the simplest nature, 
wholly devoid of selfish motives, stainless in pri- 
vate conduct, scornful of luxury, not to be over- 
borne in any test of elemental character ; each 
was a spirit self -dedicated to duty, living the life

of " wearing, daily stead fastness " that makes up 
martyrdom. And each went down, finally, to 
seeming defeat. 

"Men fight to lose the battle, and tli- tiling 
they fought for comes about in spite of tln-ir 
defeat, and when it comes it turns out not to 
be what they meant." Wlu-n (ionlon walked 
forth to his death in the gray desert dawn at 
Khartoum, it was with the bitter knowledge that 
for him the battle was indeed lost ; yet the thin^ 
he fought for has long since come about. With 
Mazzini, victory and defeat were strangely 
blended : his long fight for Italian unity seemed 
at last successful, but.the actual result was far 
other than he meant or expected it to be. He 
had dreamed of an Italy that should be free as 
well as united; and he beheld a Frankenstein 
creature, a body without a soul, which still en- 
slaved its subjects. With unlessened zeal he 
again took up the fight, and through a long 
quarter-century of exile and sickness and ever- 
increasing discouragements of every sort he 
labored literally without pause toward the real- 
ization of his hopes for a free Italy. With a 
price upon his head in nearly every European 
country, he was yet to be found wherever there 
was work to do now in Paris, now in Swit- 
zerland, now in London, now (" like a thief in 
my own land," as he said) in Italy. And at 
the last, a year or so before his death, there is 
that poignant picture of him, forced in changing 
trains to pass through the side-streets of Rome, 
yet closing his eyes that he might not see the 
city of his dreams "profaned by monarchy." 

It is with the Mazzini of these later years 
the period from 1864 to his death in 1872 that 
Mrs. Hamilton King has to do in her volume of 
"Letters and Recollections of Mazzini." As a 
young girl, generous and romantic in spite of 
home surroundings that must have been even 
more smug and oppressive than the average 
of those early- Victorian days, the author came 
strongly under the spell of the " Young Italy " 
movement. She knew nothing of Italian his- 
tory, nor had she ever spoken with or even seen 
any of those to whom the cause of Italian unity 
was sacred. But the nobility of Mazzini and 
his followers spoke irresistibly to the nobility in 
her own nature, and she resolved to dedicate 
herself to their aims and purposes. Letters to 
Mazzini brought prompt responses ; but out- 
raged parental authority placed a ban upon the 
intercourse almost in its incipiency. With tin- 
young girl's marriage, a few months later, 
the correspondence was renewed. A visit to 
Mazzini in his dingy London lodgings was 



1912.] 



THE DIAL 



395 



arranged ; other visits followed at long intervals, 
and once Mazzini stayed overnight with the 
Kings in their country home in Essex. But for 
the most part the intercourse was epistolary. 

In addition to the letters of Mazzini given in 
these pages, Mrs. King includes several of her 
own, besides some written by Madame Venturi 
one of the Ashurst family of London, and 
Mazzini's most intimate friend. All of these let- 
ters are of great interest, not least Mrs. King's. 
If to present-day readers the passionate outpour- 
ing of devotion in the young girl's first letter 
to Mazzini reads strangely, it is only because 
the language of nobility has become so largely 
a foreign tongue. 

" It seems almost sacrilegious, after nearly fifty years, 
to expose these letters, warm from living hearts, to the 
mockery of a sceptical and materialistic world. Yet in 
those days, the world was equally sceptical and materi- 
alistic, and it was even harder, and pervaded by a vice 
which has now disappeared hypocrisy. But after all, 
truth is best. There are warm hearts still, though not 
so burning with hope; all things are greyer; but it is 
good to have lived in this experience. My own letters 
are long-winded and perhaps pragmatical ; but they were 
not written in such a hurrying age, and the passion 
throbs through, though the phrases are not curtailed. 
But as empty words they are of little value. Their value 
is especially this: they are the testimony of a host of 
devoted lives. They have been sealed with blood in 
prisons, on scaffolds, and on battlefields. These men 
did not speak: they acted, and fought, and suffered, and 
died, leaving home and family, comfort and security, 
for the fatal and glorious cause." 

It is that testimony, more than any other, of 
which our self-centered and self-seeking lives are 
most in need to-day. 

The record of Mrs. King's first visit to Maz- 
zini, during the London exile, is well worth 
quoting. 

"Mazzini lived then, and during all the years I knew 
him, in a house called 18 Fulham Road. It was one 
of a row of small, three-storied houses, standing a little 
way back from the road, with, in front, a little iron gate 
and a small grass plot. I believe the whole place has 
long been demolished. He occupied the first floor of 
two rooms, and his landlady's name was Mrs. France. 
He went by the name of Signer Ernesti, and his letters 
were so addressed. This was a quite transparent dis- 
guise, as he was perfectly well known to the police; but 
it was probably convenient. I do not remember if we 
had previously announced our visit ; but we found him at 
home. He was in the small front sitting-room, so filled 
with books and papers there was hardly room to move, 
and with his little canaries and greenfinches fluttering 
about the room. He had been smoking, but had put 
away his cigar. At last we stood face to face. I had a 
photograph of him, but a small and poor one, and it was 
with an indescribable emotion that I saw before me the 
slender emaciated form, the noble face and brow, and 
the great dark, liquid velvet eyes, with their wonderful 
fire and depth, and heard the gentle, caressing voice. 
He was dressed, as always, in the deep mourning, the 



black velvet waistcoat buttoned up to the throat, which 
was his distinctive costume. I have no recollection of 
what was said. I could only utter a few words of de- 
votion and thankfulness: and though Mazzini himself 
was a fluent and eager talker, I do not remember that 
he said much, nor anything that he said." 

Three months later, Garibaldi made his 
brief visit to England. Mrs. King saw him pass 
through the London streets, standing bareheaded 
in an open carriage, garbed in the historic red 
shirt and gray mantle, gravely acknowledging 
the tumultuous greetings of the people. On the 
evening of the same day she saw him again, at 
the opera ; and shortly after there was a memo- 
rable meeting with the old lion at a breakfast 
party, Mazzini also being one of the company. 

" We were very hospitably received, and presented to 
Garibaldi. There was a large gathering, and breakfast 
was announced almost immediately. Garibaldi offered 
me his arm, and led me to the place of honour, at the 
head of the table, and seated me beside him on his right 
hand. It was the place properly belonging to the hostess. 
I was young and shy, and I felt much embarrassed by 
the marked attention and the notice it excited : my atti- 
tude to Garibaldi was to admire, not to be admired ! 
and his evident homage of gallantry only confused me. 
I do not remember any of our attempts at conversation. 
I could read Italian, but had no practice in speaking it, 
and I was shy, and did not know what to say, and Gari- 
baldi was habitually taciturn, so that it did not amount to 
much. Mazzini did not make himself at all conspicuous." 

The conception of Mazzini as a " pestiferous 
conspirator," ruthlessly sacrificing the lives of 
his followers jto achieve his own fanatical pur- 
poses, has long since become obsolete. But it is 
nevertheless good to have Mrs. King's whole- 
hearted testimony to the tenderness and gentle- 
ness and generosity of Mazzini's nature. 

" He was the gentlest of human creatures, and the 
kindest. The little birds, that flew about his room, 
nestled on his shoulder, and fed from his hand, were 
one proof of this, shut out as he was from the comfort 
of human relations. His love and tenderness to children 
were also touching and wonderful. He could be bitterly 
indignant against wrong, oppression, and cruelty; but 
his indignation itself, though fiery, had never anything 
violent or cruel. He could not be other than gentle in 
every action, word, and tone. In all his gentleness there 
was a deep note of melancholy ; and this was not merely 
for the sorrows of his country and of humanity, and for 
his own deceptions and disappointments ; for those who 
knew him, there might be perceived a perpetual mourn- 
ing for those lives which had been sacrificed in following 
him, and whose martyrdom was a perpetual weight upon 
his heart. . . . But through all the storm and sorrow of 
his life there shone a divine light of childhood. Anguish, 
care, and labour could not dim the essential simplicity, 
innocence, gaiety, and charm of nature, that made his 
the radiant presence of a child. Joy was his element, 
and he carried joy; although he himself was a martyr, 
suffering in body, heart, and soul."

She has now placed us under a double debt of 
gratitude by giving us, in her old age, these let- 
ters and recollections of her hero. It is a volume 
that will do much to enhance the ever-increasing 
lustre of Mazzini's name, and one in which every 
generous-hearted reader must rejoice. 

In closing, a word may be said concerning 
Mazzini's place in history. Some of the chron- 
iclers of the movement for Italian freedom would 
have us believe that his part in that struggle was 
a minor one, that the glory of victory belongs 
rather to the sword of Garibaldi and the brain 
of Cavour. But " the great achievement of his- 
tory," Lord Acton has told us, " is to develop 
and perfect and arm conscience "; and in that 
faith we prefer to believe that Cavour and Gari- 
baldi were but the devoted reapers of a harvest 
that Mazzini had prepared to their hands.

VISIONS OF AN IDEAL, DEMOCRACY.* 

As its sub-title indicates, Mr. Walter E. 
Weyl's " The New Democracy " is a study and 
an analysis of present-day conditions in the 
United States. Unlike Mr. A. M. Simons's 
book of recent date, this is not based upon a 
study of American history. It is also more 
optimistic, perhaps for that reason ; for nothing 
goes further than the study of history to dispel 
the view that all the ugly problems of a given 
country at a given time are new and unique. In 
comparison with Mr. Simons, Mr. Weyl appears 
to slight disadvantage, though neither of these 
social analysts seems to the reviewer to have 
said the last word on their theme. 

In Mr. Weyl's first chapters, "Disenchant- 
ment of America" and " Shadow- Democracy of 
1776," the point is raised that there has never 
been a democracy in the United States. Then 
follow two or three chapters on the essential 
individualism of the pioneers and of the sover- 
eign States of the early decades of the nineteenth 
century. Having cleared the ground, so to speak, 
the author enters upon his main theme, the 
portrait of American plutocracy, its organiza- 
tion in the years following the panic of 1873, 
its social pressures and assumptions, its entering 
upon the field of politics definitely and finally 
with the purpose of controlling legislatures,

and Economic Tendencies in the United States. By Walter 
E. Weyl, Ph.D. New York: The Maomillan Co. 



executives, and courts. It is an easy step from the 
lobby to the editorial sanctum, and .Sir. Weyl 
contends that it is hardly necessary to prove, 
at this late day, that plutocracy seized upon 
the press during the later years of the last cen- 
tury; and, wherever it was essential to its pur- 
poses, succeeded in controlling most of the great 
daily papers. But he admits that this control 
is uncertain, and is constantly shifting from one 
group to another of our larger journals. This 
is due to the fact that the reading public soon 
"catches on," and a new device must be in- 
vented ; for a paper must have readers, else it 
cannot sell either advertising space or editorials. 

Secure in its power over legislatures, execu- 
tives, and courts, and reasonably sure of guid- 
ing the organs of public opinion, plutocracy 
undertakes to improve the productive powers of 
the nation it controls, first through the organiza- 
tion and perfecting of the so-called trusts which 
regulate output, distribution, and prices; and, 
second, through "business efficiency," which 
has found of late such vogue in all quarters. 
All this is the very negation of democracy, which 
assumes independent action, waste, inefficiency 
in a certain economic sense, 

Finally, this systematic scheme leads to pro- 
test, to the upbuilding of a new democracy, 
he " new democracy " of the book, which is to 
be real and not " on paper," as was that of 1776 
and after. It is to be a "plenary, sociali/ed 
democracy forcing its ideals into industrial and 
economic affairs." This is to be done not through 
class war, nor after Karl Marx's method of brutal 
force ; but through universal education, the grad- 
ual but increasing public control of business, 
and finally the appropriation of the enormous 
surplus social product which " big business " 
has taught us is possible. Thus will all men rise 
to economic independence, or at least to equality 
of opportunity ; and plutocracy is to be driven out 
of existence. Such a democracy, instead of head- 
ing directly to "decivilization," as did the olden 
Jeffereonian system, will be lasting and benefi- 
cent ; under its aegis we shall no longer know the 
crimes of poverty, but only those of prosperity. 

This is a beautiful scheme. It is optimistic, 
and Americans love an optimist. But does it 
" square " with the historic facts ? The Marx 
theory of an inveterate war of classes waged until 
one or the other submits and accepts slavery in 
one form or another, is in accordance with the 
history of mankind from the lie^i lining: this 
theory of change and perfection which Mr. Weyl 
offers rests, to be sure, upon some new factors 
a higher standard of education for all, and most

remarkable proximity of all parts of the civilized 
world due to recent inventions. These new facts 
may justify the hopes of the "new democracy," 
but the student of the past, though willingenough, 
cannot readily accept them as realizable. One 
might offer many programmes, many speeches 
of the days when Andrew Jackson fought the 
" Monster Bank," which sounded the same note 
and portrayed the same ideal state of things 
here set forth, for example, the appeal of Silas 
Wright and his colleagues in Congress to their 
constituents in 1833. 

Without denying that this book offers much 
that is interesting, and much that commends 
itself to legislators and leaders, the reviewer 
fears that the same old struggle for privilege, 
the same snobbishness of all classes of society, 
and the same exploitations of the helpless will 
continue for countless years. The distance be- 
tween the weaker element and the stronger in 
each community is likely to remain as great as 
that between the slums and the "west sides" of 
each of our great cities. There will be improve- 
ment, there will follow reactions in the future as 
in the past ; but the saying of the great Hebrew 
teacher that " the poor ye have with you always " 
is likely to be as true in the year 2500 as in the 
year 1912. WILLIAM E. DODD. 



RECENT DISCUSSIONS OF HEREDITY.* 



In a letter to Hooker written in September, 1864, 
Darwin said: ''The tendency of hybrids to revert to 
either parent is part of a wider law (which I am fully 
convinced that I can show experimentally), namely, 
that crossing races as well as species tends to bring 
back characters which existed in progenitors hun- 
dreds and thousands of generations ago. Why this 
should be so, God knows." At the very time this 
letter was written, Gregor Mendel, in his monastery 
garden at Brtinn, was actually working out " experi- 
mentally " this " wider law " which Darwin felt must 
underlie the baffling phenomena of inheritance in 
hybrids. Mendel published the account of his most 
important results in 1866. The paper was one of the 
relatively few on matters relating to evolution which 
never attracted Darwin's attention. There have been

few workers in the history of science who have had 
so wide an acquaintance with the obscure, out-of-the- 
beaten-path, literature of their subjects as did Darwin. 
What a mischance, under such circumstances, that he 
should have overlooked the one paper that was most 
important of all ! Had Darwin become familiar with 
Mendel's work in the late sixties, while he was still 
active and able to repeat those famous experiments 
with peas (as he surely would have done), and con- 
firm Mendel's results completely, as others did many 
years later, biological research in the last quarter of 
the nineteenth century would have been quite differ- 
ent from what it actually was. 

The story of the "re-discovery " of Mendel's work 
by three European investigators at about the same 
time (1900) is familiar to everyone. In the twelve 
years that have passed since that time the study of 
genetics has developed rapidly. It is gaining more 
and more the attention and interest of biologists all 
over the world. It is a conservative statement to say 
that in these twelve years a broader comprehension 
of the meaning of heredity, and a deeper insight into 
the laws of inheritance, have been gained than from 
all the previous investigation and speculation about 
these basic problems. 

Pawlow, the great Russian physiologist, has some- 
where said that every advance in knowledge rests 
upon the discovery of a new technique a new way 
of attacking old problems which everyone thinks of 
as either solved or insoluble, and certainly quite de- 
void of untouched sources of knowledge and inspira- 
tion. No better example of the truth of this idea than 
the recent history of the science of genetics could be 
found. For it is certain that the highest significance 
of Mendel's work is to be found, not in his actual con- 
tributions to knowledge, brilliant as these were, but 
rather in the fact that he gave to biology a new way 
of looking and working at a world-old problem. The 
Mendelian method of studying inheritance is vastly 
more important than the results of Mendel's exper- 
iments with peas. 

With so much professional interest concentrated 
upon the subject of genetics, and as a consequence 
of the easily perceived bearing of this study upon hu- 
man affairs, both directly and in relation to agricul- 
ture, it is to be expected that non-technical accounts 
of what is going on in this field of biology will be 
forthcoming. Three of the books here under review 
(Darbishire's "Breeding and the Mendelian Discov- 
ery," Castle's "Heredity in Relation to Evolution and 
Animal Breeding," and Doncaster's "Heredity in 
the Light of Recent Research ") are popular treatises 
of this kind. Each of the authors has done notable 
original work in genetics and is qualified to speak 
with the authority which accompanies first-hand ac- 
quaintance with the actual phenomena. 

Professor Castle's book, which is an expansion of 
a series of lectures before an audience of teachers 
and investigators in agriculture, explains with ex- 
treme clearness and simplicity, both of manner and 
matter, the essential features of Mendelian inheri-

tance and the bearing of these facts upon some of 
the problems of organic evolution and of practical 
breeding. The examples and illustrations are taken 
largely from the author's own experiments with 
guinea pigs, rabbits, and other small mammal-. 
The treatment of the subject is rather broader in 
Mr. Doncaster's book. The latter includes a discus- 
sion of the biometric treatment of the problems of 
inheritance in addition to the Mendelian work. 
Historically the account is much more adequate 
than Mr. Castle's. Furthermore, the illustrative 
material which he makes use of includes a greater 
range of plants and animals. Both these books de- 
serve to be widely read. 

Mr. Darbishire follows a somewhat different plan 
than either of the other writers. He confines his 
attention almost entirely to the actual material with 
which Mendel worked, the garden pea. The simple 
Mendelian experiments are described and illustrated 
in great detail and with much skill. Mr. Darbi- 
shire 's technical papers have demonstrated his clever- 
ness as a writer. The present work can only enhance 
his reputation in this respect, for it is truly a bril- 
liant achievement in popular scientific writing. A 
useful feature of the book is a chapter giving de- 
tailed, but absolutely clear and simple, directions for 
carrying out a Mendelian experiment on inheritance 
in peas. From these directions any person, however 
unskilled in biological technicalities, should have no 
difficulty in repeating in his own garden the experi- 
ments which marked an epoch in the history of our 
knowledge of living things. Altogether, Mr. Darbi- 
shire has given a fitting introduction to a fascinating 
subject. 

Turning to Rignano's " Upon the Inheritance of 
Acquired Characters," we find ourselves in a very 
different sort of atmosphere. The author is by train- 
ing and profession an engineer. What knowledge he 
possesses in the field of biology is obviously derived 
from books rather than from living things. This 
leaves him quite free to settle the "large" problems 
of life without being in any way hampered by mean 
facts. Out of his inner consciousness Rignano has 
evolved an elaborate and purely metaphysical theory 
to explain how acquired characters might be in- 
herited. He brings forward no single bit of con- 
clusive evidence that they ever are inherited, nor 
has anybody else. Now who in the world cares 
whether such characters may be inherited? If it 
could once be shown beyond cavil that they are in- 
herited, it would then be time to speculate as to how 
such a result was brought about. Thirty years ago 
biologists hotly debated this question in a delightfully 
Pickwickian manner. No damage was done, and 
happily biology has left this slough of metaphysical 
despond. Rignano should have written his book then. 
It would at least have escaped being an anachronism. 
How far it is from being abreast of biological thought 
at the present time is indicated by the fact that 
Mendel's name is not even mentioned in the book.

commentt of a nities for gathering material for such 
man of letter*, * book as his " Many Celebrities and 
a Few Others" (Doubleday) have been abundant. 
A wandering life of journalism and editorship and 
book-writing has brought him in contact with many 
men and women distinguished in letters or otherwise 
prominent and interesting, and a retentive memory 
(or notebook, or both ) has made the production of 
his "bundle of reminiscences " an easy and doubtless 
congenial task. Wooed in his boyhood by the con- 
flicting charms of the stormy sea and the quiet walks 
of literature, he chose the latter, largely, one gathers, 
because a very disenchanting parental indifference 
to his running away to sea took all the romance out 
of that otherwise tempting career. To have one's 
father and mother calmly discuss with one the best 
way to perform the heroic act is certainly contrary 
to accepted tradition. But the wanderlust had to 
be appeased, and so from Liverpool, his birthplace, 
the youth made his way to New York and Boston 
and Chicago and elsewhere. Service on the staff of 
such newspapers as the Springfield "Republican," 
the New York "Times" and "Tribune," and the 
Boston "Journal," prepared him for more ambitious 
undertakings in magazine writing and editorship. 
"The North American Review" was for eight years 
under his control, or partial control, immediately 
after the untimely death of the versatile Allan Thorn- 
dike Rice. Of his books, such later ones as " Thack- 
eray's London," " At Hawarden with Mr. Gladstone," 
and In the Land of Lorna Doone " are among the 
best known. His long editorial connection with " The 
Youth's Companion," a connection still existing, has 
opened the way to intercourse with many of that 
periodical's noted contributors. Those about whom 
he chats familiarly and entertainingly include Horace 
Greeley, the elder Samuel Bowles, Richard Watson 
Gilder, Aldrich, Stockton, Stedman, Mark Twain, 
James Payn, Wilkie Collins, Walter Besant, Mr. 
Gladstone, Dr. Holmes, Henry M. Stanley, Mr. 
Thomas Hardy, and others too numerous to mention. 
Portraits abound, and no index or notes are present 
to convey a false impression of seriousness to the 
reader chiefly desirous of amusement.

work is that there is too little of it. Most students 
would welcome a fuller statement of deductions and 
more illustrative documents, in exchange, if neces- 
sary, for the history of copyright compiled from 
easily-accessible sources which occupies fifteen or 
twenty pages of the volume. There will be less gen- 
eral agreement as to the value of the comments on 
Carey as a man and as an author. This versatile 
Irishman entered upon his life in Philadelphia with 
the same outspoken activity that had led to his exile 
from his native country. He was continually en- 
gaged in personal controversies and in political and 
civic movements. He fought a duel with a political 
opponent; he organized the first American Sunday 
School Society. As an author he was eager to rush full 
tilt into any controversy, and to express opinions on 
any subject. He had much to say on political economy. 
He wrote his Vindicice Hibernicce in an attempt to 
prove Dr. Bradisher says he did prove that there 
was no Irish massacre in 1641. He was a master of 
the art of vituperation, called in his day political sat- 
ire. Dr. Bradisher prints some cordial letters writ- 
ten by William Cobbett to Carey in 1815-17, when 
the two men had come into political agreement. To 
make these effective he might have quoted from 
Carey's published attacks of some years earlier, in 
which, for example, he calls Cobbett " a wretch . . . 
accursed by God and hated by man, the most tre- 
mendous scourge that hell ever vomited forth to curse 
a people," and " a blasted, posted, loathsome coward," 
and adds "What pride! what pleasure! I should 
feel in dragging you reeking from your den, and 
cow-skinning you till Argus himself should not be 
able to perceive a hair's breadth upon your carcase 
but sore upon sore." Those who have enjoyed, and 
in a way admired, Carey as a vigorous and pictur- 
esque fighter, a devoted partisan, and a good hater 
will be surprised at Dr. Bradisher's picture of a 
mild philanthropist, who is praised for his " candor 
and fairness," "the judicial cast of his mind," and 
his "lovable nature." There are a few slips. On 
p. 7 reference is made to Noah Webster's " Progress 
of Dulness"; probably the satire by Webster's 
friend, John Trumbull, is intended. On p. 50, a 
slightly obscure passage seems to imply that " Char- 
lotte Temple" was written and first printed in 
America. On p. 65, Fessenden is referred to as one 
of the Hartford Wits. Dr. Bradisher shows, how- 
ever, by many unobtrusive allusions, that he knows 
the background of his subject better than the aver- 
age author of a dissertation whose topic lies in an 
out-of-the-way field. 

Professor George Herbert Palmer, 
refusing to be satisfied with that 
shallow psychology and ethics which 
agree to shelve the age-long problem of whether 
man is free or bound, lord of destiny or its slave, 
has tackled the problem anew, and attacked it front- 
ally rather than with any pragmatic indirection. In 
"The Problem of Freedom" (Houghton) he dis- 
cusses the whole question, for and against, in a

thorough but popular fashion, and develops the idea 
of freedom which he has worked out for himself. 
Freedom of the will in the sense of capricious inde- 
termination he rejects utterly; and determinism, in 
the sense that every action is the lawful result of 
causes, he accepts. But he does not follow his 
determinism to the extent of becoming a fatalist. 
Briefly stated, Mr. Palmer's argument for freedom 
rests on two main grounds. The first of these is 
that there are two kinds of causation. The car 
which moves because a previous cause, the moving 
engine, pulls it, is an example of sequential causa- 
tion. The man who runs from a burning building 
acts as the sequential effect of an idea the fear of 
fire. But the man who tells the truth because he 
holds an idea of moral perfection is not acting from 
the usual push of causation, because his moral per- 
fection does not yet exist and so could not be a 
cause in the usual sense. Such causation by a 
cause which does not yet actually exist, Mr. Palmer 
calls antesequential causation. As persons, he says, 
we have the choice of acting from material, sequen- 
tial causation, or of acting from ideal motives, and 
the choice of the latter method of acting is what 
confers freedom. There are obvious difficulties in 
this view, and the author admits them frankly. 
Of one, the translation of sense impressions into 
conscious motives, he writes at length, and shows 
how, under the term "parallelism," the unknown 
mode and place of the transformation from the 
outer world of sense to the inner world of person- 
ality is a mystery which all schools of thought ques- 
tion with equal lack of answer. As a complementary 
to the question of choice by the individual there 
must be chance in the outer world or else our 
choice would be meaningless. Professor Palmer 
devotes a chapter to proving that there is chance in 
the cosmos a chance made possible by the facts 
that independent chains of causation intersect at 
unforeseeable points as when the chain of causa- 
tion which impels the stone from one's hand to 
hurtle toward the mark, and the chain of causation 
which impels the migrating bird, cross each other 
with a result which is as chanceful as it is unfor- 
tunate for the bird. In spite of this looseness in 
his universe, the author avows himself a " moderate 
idealist" and a believer in the view that there is 
purpose in the universe. 

Ever since the appearance of Henry 

D - L1 y d>s " Wealth a s ainst Com - 

monwealth," " Big Business " has 
been pretty thoroughly exploited as the source of 
economic oppression and political corruption. That 
there is another side to the question is the chief 
burden of Mr. Charles Norman Fay's book entitled 
"Big Business and Government" (Moffat, Yard & 
Co,). Mr. Fay believes that we exaggerate greatly 
the monopoly element in " Big Business." The great 
enterprise survives on account of its efficiency in 
competition, and must ever be prepared to fight for 
its life. The really successful trusts produce cheaply

and sell cheaply, earning merely good profits on an 
honest capitalization. Trusts that try to earn exces- 
sive profits, or are burdened down by excessive 
capitalization, are forced to reform or die. What 
monopoly we have is largely accounted for by tin- 
tariff, which Mr. Fay would like to abolish, or by 
the Sherman law, which prevents enterprising out- 
siders from developing competition with trusts in the 
hope of being taken into the combination. Mr. Fay 
has had practical experience in Big Business, both 
as insider and as outside competitor. In the former 
role his success was only moderate, since, as he 
explains, a certain squeamishness deterred him from 
employing all available means bribing of legisla- 
tures, for example for compassing legitimate ends. 
As an outside competitor he was unmercifully pun- 
ished. Accordingly our respect for him is increased 
by the fact that he accepts without qualification the 
doctrine that the proper law of business life is vce 
victit! To Mr. Fay the great popular movement 
for the public control of great enterprise is nothing 
but the envy of the unsuccessful and incompetent, 
brought to expression under the tutelage of corrupt 
demagogy. The legislatures, the press, even the 
courts are joined in a conspiracy against ability, 
which, left untrammeled, would achieve results of 
vast benefit to all mankind. Mr. Fay flatters him- 
self that he is a reactionary. A careful examination 
of his work will show, however, that he quite mis- 
takes his own position. What he proposes is strict 
public regulation of the capitalization of the great 
corporations, the determination of a minimum rea- 
sonable profit, and a division between the corporation 
and the State of profits in excess of the minimum. 
This is really the radical position; in comparison 
with Mr. Fay, the Progressives are reactionaries. 
The book makes no pretence of scientific quality; 
but it is none the less worthy of reading.

is a compilation from contemporary newspapers, 
congressional and campaign political speeches, party 
convention resolutions, and influential books such 
as Helper's "Impending Crisis." In a series of 
appendices Mr. Fit* prints the party platforms, and 
one noted speech by a leading representative of each

freely expresses his own judgment of men, their

Douglas stands out as a powerful and fascinating 
personality, in spite of his inconsistencies and self-

are emphasized, for Yancey 's importance as a leading 
Southern irreconcilable has long been underestimated. 
The moral issues of the controversy are not subor- 
dinated, but other questions are given their proper im- 
portance. Mr. Fite's general attitude on the campaign 
is well stated in the Introduction, when summarizing 
his view of the Civil War itself. "In the last analysis 



the one complete justification of secession was the 
imperative necessity of saving the vast property 
of slavery from destruction; secession was a com- 
mercial necessity, designed to make these billions 
secure from outside interference. Viewed in thi> 
light, secession was right; for any people, prompted 
by the commonest motives of self-n--pe<-t and >elf- 
defense, and with no moral scruples against slavery, 
would have followed the same course. . . . But 
the North was no less right in opposing slavery, 
for theirs was a course springing from the natural 
promptings of morality. History, then, must adjudge 
that both sides in the controversy were right, and 
that the war was bound to come when the opposing 
sides conscientiously held, the one to the wrong, the 
other to the right, of slavery." The principal value 
of the book is that it presents impartially and from 
a modern viewpoint the essentials to an understand-

had disposed of practically all his wealth in his life- 
time. He had had what we in America call a "good 
time" in making his money, and a still better one 
in giving it away. An excellent biography of the 
millionaire philanthropist was prepared a short time 
before his death by Mr. Edward F. Williams, and 
it now appears, handsomely printed and illustrated, 
from the Pilgrim Press. The first five of its seven- 
teen chapters follow Dr. Pearsons's progress along 
the road to fortune, from the Vermont farm where 
he was born of vigorous, hard-headed, kind-heart -d 
Yankee stock, to the Chicago home where he made 
his presence felt as a power for good in the com- 
munity. A few years of medical practice, six months 
of European travel, several seasons of public lectur- 
ing, a short interval of farming, these were some 
of the miscellaneous activities of this versatile Ver- 
monter by which he acquired that knowledge of the 
world and of human nature, and that control of him- 
self, which contributed to his immediate and increas- 
ing success as a dealer in Illinois prairie lands, 
Michigan timber tracts, and Chicago real estate, 
when in 1860 he took up his abode in the prospec- 
tive metropolis of the middle West and began to 
pile up the millions that he took such pleasure after- 
ward in dissipating for the benefit of humanity. The 
last twenty years, and more, of his life were de- 
voted to this task of averting the disgrace of dying 
rich; and the world already knows, in a general 
way, how well the task was performed. The de- 
tails, both of the up-building and of the down-pulling 
of Dr. Pearsons's large fortune, with some graphic 
touches in the way of a more intimate portrayal of 
the man himself, are to be found in Mr. Williams's 
interesting book. The illustrations consist mainly 
of portraits of Dr. Pearsons.

THE DIAL, 



401 



Some charming The Uttle V lume entitled "Leaflets 

studies from from Italy" (Putnam), by M. Nat- 
italian history. a ji ne Crumpton, contains four essays, 
of which the last one was completed just before the 
author's death, last June. The essays have been 
edited for the press by the writer's sister, Margaret L. 
C. Nicola. They constitute one of the most fragrant 
and delightful volumes of foreign studies recently 
published. Particularly charming is the first and 
most considerable section of the book, an account 
of the Roman Empress Galla Placidia, growing out 
of a mention of her mausoleum in Ravenna. The 
skill with which that interesting woman's part in the 
wild tangle of fifth century Roman affairs is picked 
out and set together into a clear and interesting story 
amounts almost to genius. The second essay is an 
almost equally pleasant account of the life of Santa 
Monica, mother of St. Augustine. Then comes a 
scanty history of the worship of Cybele in Italy; 
and last a study of Genoa, which savors too much 
of the guide-book to have the charm of the earlier 
sketches, but which has its own interest, and which 
is supplemented by a long list of " Notable Doorways 
and Reliefs in Genoa." From first page to last it 
is vividly evident, for all the quiet restraint of the 
presentation, that the work is a labor of love and a 
careful selection from the data of long and rich expe- 
rience and extensive knowledge. Readers who have 
never seen Italy, or who have not even the most ele- 
mentary knowledge of Italian and Roman history, 
are not confused or embarrassed by obscure allusions ; 
and yet there is such a genuinely personal touch in 
the narrative that the traveller and the scholar will 
not fail to find pleasure in following through its 
tantalizingly small number of pages. It is a pity 
that this sympathetic student of things Italian could 
not have lived to give us many more such volumes. 

'The law's ^ n one f n ^ s poems Pope has uttered 

delays and a "curse on all laws but those which 

other vexations. j Qve hag made . Many anot her, both 

before and since, has felt impelled to deplore the 
injustice of man-made laws. Some of the considera- 
tions that induce this state of mind in a thoughtful 
person are well set forth by Mr. Samuel Beach 
Chester, of the Middle Temple, in a readable book 
entitled "Anomalies of the Law," published in this 
country by Messrs. Little, Brown & Co. A quota- 
tion from Charles Lever, satirizing barristers, serves 
as introduction to the author's treatment of legal 
anomalies connected with divorce, death and burial, 
wills, libel and slander, imprisonment for debt, the 
need for the right of property in surnames, literary 
censorship, capital punishment, murder and suicide, 
legitimation, criminal appeal, client, solicitor and 
counsel, the morality bill, accession, and coronation 
oaths and declarations. A pertinent passage for quo- 
tation at this time is the following, from the chapter 
on libel and slander: "To be a popular or a cele- 
brated figure at the present day is to be the target for 
every form of foul abuse, criminal concoctions and 
cruel lies. Whether a person's life is blameless or 



blameworthy, he only has to reach a certain degree of 
public attention to be douched with the vile outpour- 
ings of a cesspool, or blinded by the volcanic lava of 
jealousy and spite. The individual who yearns for 
fame had better first well calculate his power to en- 
dure its concomitants ! " The writer's assertion that, 
in literary censorship, "both legal and literary skill" 
are needed in order to determine the decency or in- 
decency of certain problem novels, is a little amusing, 
at least to a reader not educated in a law school or 
law office. A few pages of the book might well have 
been devoted to a consideration of the lamentable 
lot of the innocent man unjustly accused and brought 
to trial, even though he be acquitted. No adequate 
redress for his grievances has ever been found. A 
critical reviewer must note with surprise that Mr. 
Chester, with all his "legal and literary skill," and 
with his logical habit of mind, does not refrain 
from using the absurd and indefensible expression, 
"equally as good as." 

In his opening chapter of "My Lady 
. Castlemaine" (Estes) Mr. Philip W. 
Sergeant says : " If her bodily loveli- 
ness was universally recognized in her lifetime and 
is incontestable to-day, her moral character was a 
byword while she lived and has never found an 
apologist since her death"; and in closing he says: 
"Barbara Villiers is scarcely likely to be forgotten 
while the combination of a face of eminent beauty 
and the heart of an utter rake has any attraction for 
weak mankind." Such portion of weak mankind as 
cares to read the latest and most elaborate account 
of Barbara Villiers, Countess of Castlemaine and 
afterward Duchess of Cleveland, chiefly renowned 
as recipient of certain royal attentions from Charles 
II., will find Mr. Sergeant's book all that could be 
desired in its way. The beautiful Barbara has already 
figured in Mr. Alfred Kalisch's "Lives of Twelve 
Bad Women," also in Mr. Allan Fea's "Some Beau- 
ties of the Seventeenth Century," and more promi- 
nently in Mr. G. S. Steinman's privately-printed 
" Memoir " of her ladyship, while the honor has even 
been accorded her of a place in the "Dictionary of 
National Biography." The gossip-loving Pepys, too, 
mentions her frequently in his Diary; and as he 
records an instance of kindness on her part toward 
a child, we must conclude that she was not wholly 
bad. Nine portraits of her, from paintings by Lely, 
Kneller, and others, with ten other portraits, illus- 
trate the book, which also has a ten-page index and 
twenty- three pages of bibliographical and explanatory 
notes. On the whole, it is clear that the author be- 
lieved the biography of even an "utter rake" worth 
doing well, if worth doing at all. 

What substantial good did Joan of 
More about 6 

the Maid Arc accomplish ? Henry VI. would 

of Orleans. have ruled France quite as efficiently 

as the foolish and ungrateful Charles VII.; and, with 
all its faults, the English civilization of the fifteenth 
century was so vastly superior to that of France

THE DIAJ, 



[May 16, 



that an English protectorate might have been a dis- 
tinct gain. Such is the thesis upheld hy Lieutenant 
Colonel Andrew C. P. Haggard in his new book 
entitled "The France of Joan of Arc " (Lane). The 
raising of the siege of Orleans, he maintains, would 
have come of necessity in a few days or weeks, since 
the English were reduced in numbers till the siege 
had become a farce, and were losing ground every 
day. Joan, in his opinion, did nothing that cannot 
be adequately explained by the magnetism of a 
strong and enthusiastic nature, aided by the bound- 
less superstition of the time. Aside from this de- 
limitation of her work and influence, the book is the 
conventional eulogistic life of the Maid; told, it 
must be admitted, in erratic and sometimes puzzling 
English, and with little skill in perspective. As the 
title indicates, Colonel Haggard is undertaking to 
present a general view of conditions in France in 
Joan's time, and not simply a life of the devoted 
Maid herself. His method of accomplishing this 
ambitious purpose has been simply to begin with the 
year 1380 and chronicle events in somewhat con- 
fused detail till the day of Joan's death then to 
stop abruptly. Since Joan's activities did not begin 
till 1429 it follows that the account of her work 
occupies a small part of the book, somewhat more 
than one-fourth. She is mentioned only once or 
twice in the narrative that precedes. On the whole, 
it is difficult to see in what sense the book is an ad- 
dition to the literature of the subject As a his- 
torical document it has little value; as a literary 
work it is extremely defective; and it is not always 
either easy or interesting to read. 

The mind'. Dl> - Geor g e W - Jacoby's Sugges- 
thare in health tion and Psychotherapy " (Scribner) 
<*nddieaic. v \\\ promptly be assigned a favor- 
able place among the increasing number of books 
aiming to enlighten the public upon the theory and 
practice of the mind's share in health and disease. 
The writer shows a clear conception of his subject, 
and takes a judicial yet firm stand in regard to the 
debatable points in this field. For this reason it is 
the more to be regretted that he has conceived his 
task so conventionally, and, as a consequence, has 
produced a book lacking in distinctive traits. At best 
only the last third of the book reflects practical in- 
sight, and sets forth the problems of close concern 
to the art of mental therapy. The manner of state- 
ment is clear and convincing, describing the several 
procedures of hypnosis, suggestion, persuasive en- 
couragement, the removal of mental obstruction, 
psycho-analysis, and the place of these in medical 
therapy, and their use and abuse in faith cure, 
Christian Science, and the like. These procedures 
Dr. Jacoby discusses, not as a panacea, but as the 
equipment of an art, possessing, like all arts, the 
possibility of danger as well as benefit The rest of 
the volume discusses discursively the psychology of 
suggestion and the history of mental practice, which, 
although pertinent enough, is already available in 
many another volume. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



A treasure-bouse of fascinating material for the biblio- 
maniac is brought together in Mr. K. M. Leonard's 
Book-Lover's Anthology " (Henry Frowde). Quota- 
tions from some two hundred authors, dealing with every 
phase of books and reading, are embodied in the four 
hundred pages of the collection. It forms a worthy suc- 
cessor to the well-known "Book-Lover's Enchiridion " 
compiled by Alexander Ireland many yean ago, and 
long since out of print. 

Mr. Robert Haven Schauftler's "Our American Holi- 
days " series is now continued by volumes on " Flag Day" 
and "Independence Day" (Moffat). The earlier volumes 
of this series have been acclaimed with delight by school 
teachers the country over, and there is no reason to think 
that the new ones will prove any less popular. Nothing 
is harder than to get up a school celebration without 
help of this sort; with such assistance, it becomes an 
inspiration and a pleasure. 

We can hardly imagine any great demand for a 
"Russian Year Book" among American and English 
readers, but Dr. Howard P. Kennard seems to have be- 
lieved such a demand to exist, since he has compiled a 
reference work of this type, which now appears for the 
second year, and bids fair to be continued annually. 
For those who want the sort of information it contains, it 
will doubtless be found of the highest value. The 
Messrs. Macmillan are the publishers. 

Miss Alice M. Atkinson is the author of a reading- 
book for children on " The European Beginnings of 
American History " (Ginn) which deserves hearty com- 
mendation. Most of our young people approach the 
history of their own country without any background at 
all, and this volume supplies just what they need. It 
offers a brief and readable survey of European history 
from the history of Rome down to the Elizabethan times 
which are commonly taken as the starting-point of our 
own annals. A few chapter-titles are as follows: "The 
Romans in Britain," " The Vikings," " Country People 
in the Middle Ages," The Black Death and the Labor 
Troubles," " The New World," and " English Seamen." 
These will give some slight idea of the richness of in- 
terest offered by the book. 

The same careful attention to every practical detail 
that has made so useful the previous issues of the Mod- 
ern American Library Economy Series " marks also the 
latest number published, which bears for its sub-title. 
" Large Pictures, Educational and Decorative," being 
Section I. of Part VI., " Art Department." The authors 
of the pamphlet are Miss Marjary L. Gilson and Mr. 
John Cotton Dana. A previous number of the series, 
entitled " The Picture Collection," has described these 
wall pictures used by the Newark Public Library in its 
work and for the ornamentation of its rooms, and the 
publication now issued is devoted chiefly to a descrip- 
tion of the routine business of selecting, ordering, mount- 
ing, storing, and exhibiting the pictures, with a classified 
list of those owned by the Newark library, and also a list 
of dealers in such pictures. Details of size and price, with 
other useful information, are not lacking, and numer- 
ous half-tone illustrations supplement the printed mat- 
ter. The Newark library is exceptionally well-equipped 
in its department of lithographs and other inexpensive 
illustrations for educational work, and is therefore quali- 
fied to issue a remarkably useful manual for the guid- 
ance of others in this branch of library activity. The 
Elm Tree Press publishes this series.

NOTES. 



Sarah Grand, it is reported, has just completed a new 
novel, which will appear in the autumn under the title 
of " Adam's Orchard." 

The addresses recently delivered by Hon. Whitelaw 
Reid before the Edinburgh Philosophical Institution are 
soon to be issued in book form. 

Mr. Richard Washburn Child has recently completed 
a novel, entitled "The Blue Wall," which Houghton 
Mifflin Co. will publish next month. 

" Chronicles of Avonlea," the new book by Miss 
L. M. Montgomery, author of " Anne of Green Gables," 
will be published early next month by Messrs. L. C. Page 
& Co. 

Beginning in August next, Mr. Mitchell Kennerley 
announces that he will publish a new volume of original 
poetry the first of every month, and he invites annual 
subscribers at a special "bef ore-publication" price. Mr. 
Kennerley makes the statement that none of these vol- 
umes will be published at the author's expense. 

It is reported that suit for libel has been brought by 
Lord Alfred Douglas against Mr. Arthur Ransome, the 
author of " Oscar Wilde, a Critical Study," recently 
published in this country by Mr. Mitchell Kennerley. 
Papers have already been prepared in the case, and Mr. 
Ransome's book withdrawn by the London publisher. 

The editing of Meredith's letters has been reluctantly 
relinquished by Lord Morley, whom the pressure of 
public duties forces to suspend the congenial task he had 
begun and had hoped to finish. The Meredith family, 
it is reported, will not ask anyone else to take up the 
interrupted work, but will themselves continue the edit- 
ing of the letters and supply the necessary notes. 

An important study in a hitherto neglected field is 
announced by Messrs. Longmans, Green & Co. in Mr. 
Julius B. Cohen's volume entitled " Smoke: A Study of 
Town Air." How the growth of vegetation is stunted, 
daylight diminished, and the death rate increased in 
various sooty communities is shown in this book by tab- 
ulations and photographs. The economic aspect of the 
smoke problem is principally discussed. 

Three volumes of considerable current importance to 
be published shortly by the Macmillan Co. are: "Gov- 
ernment by All the People; or, The Iniatiative, Ref- 
erendum, and Recall as Instruments of Democracy," by 
Dr. Delos F. Wilcox; " The Supreme Court and the 
Constitution," by Mr. Charles A. Beard ; and " Con- 
centration and Control: A Solution of the Trust Problem 
in the United States," by President C. R. Van Hise. 

Four hitherto unannounced volumes to be published 
immediately by Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. are the fol- 
lowing: "The Last Legitimate King of France," an 
account of Louis XVII. of France and his mystery, by 
Phoebe Allen; " Woman Adrift," by Mr. Harold Owen, 
another of the vain attempts to sweep back the inevitable 
tide of woman suffrage ; " The Romance of Words," by 
Professor Ernest Weekly; and "The Quest of Glory," 
an historical romance of the time of Louis XV. of 
France, by Miss Marjorie Bowen. 

Mr. D. B. Updike, of The Merrymouut Press, Bos- 
ton, announces the publication of a second group of 
books in " The Humanist's Library," under the editor- 
ship of Mr. Lewis Einstein, author of "The Italian 
Renaissance in England." The four volumes that will 
make up this second group are as follows: " Correspon- 
dence of Hubert Languet and Sir Philip Sidney," edited 



and with Introduction by Mr. William Aspen wall Brad- 
ley; Albrecht Diirer's "Journeys to Venice and to the 
Low Countries," edited by Mr. Roger Fry; Pico della 
Mirandola's " A Platonick Discourse upon Love," trans- 
lated by Mr. Thomas Stanley and edited by Mr. Edmund 
G. Gardner; Giovanni della Casa's "The Galateo: Of 
Manners and Behaviour," edited by Dr. J. E. Spingarn. 
As in the case of the first four volumes issued in this 
series, the editions of the volumes in the second group 
will be limited to the number of subscriptions received 
before publication.

CHOICE SUMMER READING 

HOUitolATWANDWEKOHfi 

By E. R. LIPSETT. With Eight Full=page Illustrations in Two Colors by 
Joseph Damon. This story concerns a young Irish girl and her parents who left the 
"old country" to make a new home for themselves in America. Their impressions of 
New York make very entertaining reading. The comic situations are described in the 
inimitable manner of an Irishman, and the occasional touches of pathos are very genuine 
and sincere. Decorated cloth. $1.30 net. Postage, 12 cents. 

TheFORESTonlhelULL 

By EDEN PHILLPOTTS, author of "The Beacon," etc. A story of a woman's 
self-sacrifice and the great life lesson which the forest taught her. The magic word- 
painting, the racy humor, the skill in characterization which are shown in all Mr. 
Phillpott's writings are here more marked than ever, and his favorite locality 
Dartmoor is presented to the reader in even more attractive guise than heretofore. 
Decorated cloth. $1.30 net. Postage, 12 cents. 

TME DEWrOND 

By CHARLES MARRIOTT, author of "Now," "The Intruding Angel," etc. 
"Dewpond" expresses the quality of youth, and the heroine of Mr. Marriott's new 
novel is the very embodiment of youth, even though married, a mother, and twenty-eight 
years old. The story shows remarkably keen observation on the part of the author, 
and treats of the ever-interesting subject, a mismated couple. Decorated cloth. 
$1.30 net. Postage, 12 cents. 

TheOIILDRENorALSACE 

By RENE BAZIN, author of "The Nun," "Redemption," etc. A story of Alsace 
full of this famous author's penetrative charm. It is of Alsace conquered, of those

and will find it an ideal pocket companion 
for his excursions on "the open road."

FROM THE 

WRITINGS Of 

WALT WHITMAN 

COMPILED BY 
WALDO R. BROWNE 

WITH INTRODUCTION BY 
JOHN BURROUGHS 

Photogravure Portrait, $1.00 net 



AS Mr. Burroughs points out in his admirable 
^^ introduction to this charming volume, no other 
poet's imagination has so "reveled" in thoughts of 
the whole scheme of things as Walt Whitman's. His 
writing of nature, whether in poetry or prose, is 
always marked by vividness and actuality : in verse 
by a lyrical passion and in prose by a luxuriance of 
observation that are unique. This collection of 
out-of-door passages from his writings will appeal 
strongly, not only to all admirers of his poetry, but 
to alllovers of the open. It is an ideal book for the 
pocket on a country walk, and an equally ideal gift 
for the nature-lover. 

"An altogether discriminating anthology. . . . Whitman poet and 
Whitman diarist are both most happily represented. "The Independent. 

"A welcome little outdoor book, fit for the pocket. . . . The selections 
are from the journals and poems, and show Whitman keenly observant 
of and exultant in his surroundings." The Nation. 
" For him who loves Whitman and frequent reference to him at his best, 
yet wishes a pocketable volume, 'The Rolling Earth* is ideal."

ON EEADING OUT-OF-DOORS, 



In proportion as people cling to the city, they 
long for what they call "God's out-of-doors." 
To-day people are clinging to the city desper- 
ately, for nowhere else is the flux of life so en- 
chantingly fluid, nowhere else the elan vital so 
intoxicatingly urgent. But when the force of 
the current brings weariness and satiety, as it 
does from time to time, they yearn for the simple 
joys of the countryside pure air, restful green 
meadows, cow's-milk that is still warm, and a 
book of verses underneath the bough. Some of 
them, indeed, the weariest and the most frivol- 
ous, would prefer to the book of verses a novel 
advertised as one of the "best sellers." But 
with the inveterate readers of light fiction 
those who are unable to read with pleasure any- 
thing else we have not here to do. We shall 
find it more profitable to consider the case of 
those who take with them, on week-end journeys 
and summer vacations, a copy, let us say, of 
" Hamlet," or " Pendennis," or " Prometheus 
Unbound," or the " Oxford Book of English 
scant Verse." And let us assume (what we have 
warrant for assuming) that the readers of such 
books as these are interested, not in having 
read them, not in attaining a sweet oblivion, 
but in deriving from them a solid and elevating 
pleasure. 

To readers of this sort, who are, we trust, 
more abundant than they seem to be, reading 
out-of-doors generally means an unfulfilled inten- 
tion. On departing from the city for a ramble 
in the woods or over the hills, or on leaving the 
summer hotel for a stroll to a particularly pleasant 
spot, they thrust into their pockets or perfumed 
hand-bags the copy of " Hamlet," " Pendennis," 
or what not ; and they return having read only 
a few pages or nothing at all ; with the result, 
finally, that the book is worn, stained, full of 
four-leaf clovers and little stray insects, and 
unread. Bluntly and in brief, the out-door 
reader does not read. 

Why? The reason is, I think, not far to seek. 
Books are made by man, who vitalizes them with 
his sensuous, moral, and intellectual faculties; 
and whoever reads a book wisely concentrates 
upon it his whole experience and aspiration, his 
sensuous, moral, and intellectual faculties. As

the writer, so the reader. In the privacy of the 
library on a winter evening, this concentration 
is readily attained, and it is accompanied with 
that glow of full life which Faust's Famulus 
described: 

Da werden Winteroachte hold und schb'n, 
Ein selig Leben warmet alle Glieder." 

But in the teeming publicity of outer nature on 
a summer afternoon, this concentration is well- 
nigh impossible : the moral and intellectual facul- 
ties are dormant, activating, so to speak ; and 
the happy glow, if one glows at all, is predom- 
inantly sensuous, as of a snake luxuriating in 
the sun. The plane of intelligence is lowered 
from that of man as a human creature to that 
of man as an animal. That side of man which 
is related with the placidity of nature flourishes 
at the expense of the side of man which is, so 
far as we know, peculiar to man. It would, of 
course, be absurd to maintain that this decline in 
the dignity of man is never desirable : the heal- 
ing power of nature inherent in her large equa- 
nimity has been celebrated by countless poets, 
and is vaguely realized by everyone who seeks 
recreation out-of-doors. The pleasures that na- 
ture offers are legitimate, even though they are 
inferior to some of our human pleasures. But 
it must not be forgotten that they are sensuous, 
that they thrive while the distinctively human 
faculties slumber ; and surely a good book, in- 
tended to appeal to the whole of man, cannot be 
read to advantage by a part of man. 

Readers who would resist the sensuous placid- 
ity of nature meet with varying degrees of suc- 
cess. If you are versed in bird and insect lore, 
you are utterly lost. Just as you turn the page, 
a red-eyed vireo is sure to come down from 
the treetop above you to comment on your fool- 
ishness with a series of peevish triplets : " What 
are you doing? Stop it now. Close the book. 
Look at me " ; a cardinal grosbeak or a great- 
crested flycatcher will break into the fragile 
melody of your poet with an hilarious and some- 
what derisive shout ; and a little green bee, bur- 
nished and flashing in the sunlight as he buries 
himself in a pretty flower, will put to shame the 
dryad of your stanzas for is he not real and 
there? And if your book is Richard De Bury's 
little classic, you will no sooner read "at the 
sting of the biting flea the sacred book is flung 
aside" than a formidable mosquito will alight 
upon your neck and outrage your ego. Nature 
may, indeed, induce reverie; but she does not 
induce contemplation. Whittier, who wrote 
abundantly of woods and waters that minister 
- the healing of their life," was more aware 



than we seem to be to-day of the treachery of 
nature's "solitudes." 

But nature is not solitude: 

She crowds us with her thronging wood; 

Her many hands reach out to ua, 

She will not leave our senses still, 
But drags them captive at her will." 

You may resist the blandishments of nature, 
but you cannot whether you "love" nature 
or are indifferent to her exclude them alto- 
gether from your consciousness. 

Reading after a walk in the country is quite 
another matter. Partly as a result of our phy- 
sical exertion, partly as a result of the poise 
and the keenness of our faculties that nature's 
healing power brings, we find ourselves unus- 
ually alert and receptive. "It is at night, and 
after dinner," Stevenson wrote in "Walking 
Tours," "that the best hour comes." Tobacco 
and grog were never so satisfying, he goes 
on to say; and if you read a book, "you find 
the language strangely racy and harmonious; 
words take on a new meaning ; single sentences 
possess the ear for half an hour together ; and 
the writer endears himself to you, at every page, 
by the nicest coincidence of sentiment." Al- 
though our critical judgment may suffer, we 
read more receptively then than at any other 
time; there may be hours when we read more 
wisely, but there is no hour when we are more 
responsive, more quick to see the full meaning. 
No doubt it is significant, in this connection, to 
remember De Quincey's description of Words- 
worth after the return of the poet from a long 
day's walk, when his eyes had "an appearance 
the most solemn and spiritual that it is possible 
for the human eye to wear." 

So difficult and so unsatisfactory is the habit 
of reading out-of-doors, that we are justified, I 
think, in calling it a fad. If we desire to ex- 
plain the attractiveness of the fad, it will be 
difficult, unless we assume the air of apology 
or charity, to avoid two conclusions : first, that 
nature woos the sensuous faculties of man, his 
lower faculties ; second, that nature, unfriendly 
to our intellectual faculty, reduces the mind to 
a state of inactivity that we find agreeable. In 
large measure the popularity of nature's charms 
is due to our distrust and dislike of the intel- 
lect ; we become, for better or worse, 

" too weak to bear 

The insupportable fatigue of thought." 
Might it not be well to eschew pocket editions 
especially adapted to superficial reading out-of- 
doors, and to brood over our "Pendennis, 
" Prometheus Unbound," and the rest at home,

in our libraries, where we are free to animate 
our whole self and not merely our sensuous self ? 
Further, if we insist on the delightfulness of 
reading out-of-doors, let us carry to the stream- 
side and the pine-grove, not books that require 
prolonged concentration, but rather anthologies 
and brief essays, the wafers of the mind rather 
than the staff of life. Then let us munch and 
ruminate as thoughtfully as the singing birds 
and buzzing insects will permit. 

NORMAN FOERSTER. 



CAS UAL COMMENT. 

THE DECLINE OF THE SMALL BOOKSHOP furnished 
Mayor Gaynor with a theme for regretful reminis- 
cence in his recent address before the booksellers' 
convention in New York. His friend Mr. Simon 
Brentano calls him "a great book-knower," and be- 
lieves that his words "will mean a good deal to the 
booksellers of this country, and will increase their 
interest in good books." Mr. Gaynor said, in open- 
ing : " One of the things that I have observed since 
I left my country home and came to large cities is 
the decline of the retail bookstore in the large cities. 
Why, over in Brooklyn, where I live, and here in 
Manhattan which some people call New York, 
although it is only a little bit of New York, you 
know there used to be any number of small book- 
stores. We used to lounge around in them. . . . 
How many happy hours, and sometimes hours of 
exaltation, have I spent down in Miller's bookstore 
in Nassau Street, for instance. There I pored over 
the curious books of the world as well as the choice 
and ordinary books." The multiplication of books 
has not, the speaker feared, correspondingly in- 
creased the real reading habit, the weighing and 
pondering of what is worth while in literature. His 
genial remembrance of the book-browser in musty 
bookshops recalls regretfully the time, not so very 
long ago, when the Old Corner Bookstore in Boston 
was the daily haunt of both writers and readers of 
good literature. There the young Lowell offered to 
Emerson his tribute of admiration for the Concord 
transcendentalisms verse, and there Longfellow and 
Whittier and Holmes were familiar figures in the 
congested alcoves of the friendly book-dealer. But 
to-day we telephone to the department-store for the 
latest sensation in fiction, and bookstore book-chat 
is less and less heard in the land. 


HOW TO READ ONE HUNDRED BOOKS A DAY, which 

the librarian who wishes to make himself an author- 
ity on the literature of his own language alone ought, 
in theory, to do, is a problem to dismay the stoutest 
heart, or rather the most vigorous intellect. Alii- 
bone's " Dictionary of Authors " estimates the num- 
ber of books published in the English language up 
to the year 1870 at six hundred and fifty thousand; 
and the rapidly increasing annual rate of publication 



since then would surely bring the present total well 
up toward the three-quarter-million mark, if not be- 
yond it. Allowing three hundred working days in 
the year, we find that to go through this stupendous 
mass of printed matter at the rate of one hundred 
works (not volumes) a day would require twenty- 
five years of toil; and meanwhile the accretions of 
that quarter-century would be piling up as another 
Hercules-task for the reader. But luckily ninety-nine 
hundredths of what is published in the literature of 
knowledge soon becomes superseded by later re- 
searches, and fully forty-nine fiftieths of the litera- 
ture of power speedily ceases to appeal with any 
living interest to the great mass of readers, or even 
to any single reader. Therefore the problem of mas- 
tering the literature of our own tongue reduces itself 
to comparatively manageable proportions ; otherwise 
the conscientious librarian would be driven to insanity 
or suicide, or both. The librarian of the Vancouver 
Public Library said in an address at the third annual 
conference of the Pacific Northwest Library Associ- 
ation, whose proceedings are now published in con- 
venient pamphlet form : " There is no doubt that the 
salvation of the librarian depends upon the depth, 
the width, and the extent of his reading. And he 
must continue to read, read, and read again, or he 
is certainly lost." This is put rather strongly, for 
rhetorical effect ; but certainly it is in large part by 
reading that the librarian is to work out his own sal- 
vation as well as that of those who look to him for 
intellectual quickening and sustenance. 


PRESIDENT HIBBEN'S CONCEPTION OF A LIBERAL 
EDUCATION, as set forth in his inaugural address at 
Princeton, deserves at least a passing comment of 
approval. The time-honored "humanities," in his 
scheme of education, are not to be slighted in favor 
of all sorts of new-fangled electives. "The hit-and- 
miss choice of an immature mind in new surround- 
ings," he well says, "forms a poor propaedeutic to 
the serious tasks of free investigation, of original 
thought, and of practical efficiency." The student 
"must be so led in the way of knowledge that he 
will come to know something of the human world in 
which he lives, something also of that world of the 
past whose achievements are his heritage, something 
of the form and spirit of its classical languages and 
literature, something of its history, its art, customs, 
manners, morals, and institutions in a word, he 
must know the thought of the world which possesses 
universal meaning and universal significance." As 
to training in his mother tongue, "certainly the 
educated man should be able to understand his own 
language with some appreciation of its power and 
beauty, be able also to speak it as to the manner 
born and not as a barbarian, and to express himself 
by the written word in such a manner as to reveal 
and not obscure his thought and feeling." After this 
grounding in the essentials of liberal culture, some 
freedom of election may be allowed the student in 
his choice of studies; but, emphatically, "the uni-

versity is not specifically designed for the purpose 
of fitting a man directly for the daily duties of his 
future work in life. It should attempt to develop 
the whole man." Nothing new or startling, to be sure, 
in all this; but every word of it sane and rational 

and never out of season, however often repeated. 



CONTRIBUTORS TO "THE LYRIC YEAR," the 
forthcoming volume of competitive verse which will 
appear under the auspices of Mr. Mitchell Kenner- 
ley, publisher, and Messrs. Edward J. Wheeler and 
William Stanley Braithwaite, appraisers of poetry, 
will be selected from the five hundred or more aspi- 
rants who will have submitted their compositions 
on or before the first of June, when the competition 
closes and the three prize-winning poems will be de- 
cided upon, out of the one hundred that are to be 
sifted from the two thousand or more manuscripts 
and published. It is reported that every State in 
the United States is represented in this scramble for 
poetic honors (and emoluments), and that one con- 
fident competitor has had the hardihood to ask for 
an immediate partial payment on account If a 
pecuniary incentive and the excitement of competi- 
tion can produce immortal verse, "The Lyric Year" 
will be an immense success: and its editors appar- 
ently believe that Pegasus will prove splendidly re- 
sponsive to the spur with which he has been pricked, 
for they say : " If anything ails American poetry, it 
is lack of encouragement and recognition. It is sur- 
prising how cordially both the lowly and the great 
have responded to every demand for a high stand- 
ard and for faultless verse. It is significant, too, 
how susceptible the young writers are to enthusiasm 
and attention. ' The Lyric Year ' hopes to help the 
poets to win public attention, and to aid in the 
struggle that confronts our writers." If after this 
there remain any mute inglorious Milton* bashfully 
shrinking behind their own modesty, it will not be 
the fault of the projectors of "The Lyric Year." 



THE REHABILITATION OF SOILED LIBRARY BOOKS, 

were such rehabilitation possible and practicable, 
would be a heaven-sent blessing to readers of deli- 
cate sensibilities, and would save much expense 
now incurred in replacing with new copies the vol- 
umes that in a too unsightly manner attest their ex- 
treme popularity. Perhaps some inventive genius 
will before long give us a washing-machine that 
shall do for begrimed books what certain machines, 
now being tested at Washington by the government, 
are said to do for the much-thumbed and stained 
greenbacks and yellowbacks that are daily returned 
to the treasury department for redemption. In two 
minutes one of these machines will restore a dis- 
reputable rag of paper money to something like 
pristine freshness and crispness. Another machine, 
of a slightly different pattern, does it in three min- 
utes. A thousand notes, it is estimated, can be 
regenerated at an expense of only twenty cents. 
Water and soap and chemicals and heated cylinders, 
with more or less employment of brisk whirling 



motion, cooperate to separate the stamped paper 
from its accretions of dirt and its invading colonies 
of germs. It is true that a bound book is a very 
different thing from a simple oblong slip of excep- 
tionally strong and durable paper. But to inven- 
tive genius all things are possible, and we shall 
continue to hope that some day every library will 
possess, as an indispensable part of its equipment, an 
inexpensive, easily-operated, and thoroughly effective 
book-cleaning machine. 



THE LITERARY BKXT may be regarded, in some 
instances, as not so much a positive and conscious 
leaning toward letters as a disappointed drawing- 
back from everything else. Many a man has been 
cradled into authorship by disgust with law or med- 
icine or theology or business or teaching or some 
other of a thousand occupations uncongenial to him. 
An article having the ring of a real confession ap- 
peared the other day in a prominent journal. It 
purported to have been written by a woman author 
who signed herself A. II." Of her first ill-directed 
endeavors to find herself and her life-work we 
read, among other frank confessions, the following : 
"Looking back a long way upon my teaching record, 
I marvel that I was able to hold myself for three 
years to an occupation that filled my soul not merely 
with dislike with loathing. Perhaps it was because 
the years were so unbearable that during them I first 
tried to write." Literary success by no means came 
at the first call. Various trying experiences followed, 
and yet, all through that involvement, which shook 
life to the centre of me, I had remained obsessed by 
the need of outside expression for inside experience, 
everything, even the most passionate of human inter- 
ests, remaining for me subordinate to the will and 
intention to write." And after ten weary years of 
seemingly fruitless striving, of repeated rebuffs from 
editors and publishers, the first glimmer of success 
dawned in the shape of an acceptance of a short story ; 
and after that the path of letters seems to have shone 
more and more unto the perfect day. And yet there 
are not a few who think it must be so easy to write a 

book, and so simple to make a fortune out of its sale. 



A POSTSCRIPT TO "THE PROMISED LAND," that 

notable bit of intimate autobiography which has 
already passed into a second edition, is furnished by 
its author in a recent interview. "I want to make 
the point," she is reported as saying, " since I have 
an opportunity, that in Russia emancipation through 
a liberal attitude in religion is impossible for the 
Jew. On my recent visit to Polotzk I saw signs of 
the struggle of the younger generation to put aside 
all that separates them from the world around them 
in order to be merged with their neighbors; but it 
is all in vain. The young men shave, the young 
wives refuse the wig, they all speak Russian, they 
join an occasional Gentile friend at a table that is 
not kosher they seek to bridge their separation in 
every possible way, even at the cost of their parents' 
broken hearts. But what good does it do them?

The schools are closed against them as jealously as 
ever, they are hounded and crippled as mercilessly 
as before, they have lost the firm anchor of their 
old faith and have gained no compensating haven. 
A reformed Jew is still a Jew. The Russian gov- 
ernment does not want the Jew in any guise. No 
degree of conformity will save the Jew in Russia. 
Not until a successful political revolution has up- 
rooted all the blind sins of the Russian autocracy will 
there be any hope of emancipation for the slaves of 
the Pale." No wonder Mary Antin rejoices at her 
timely escape to the land of promise. 



THE LIMIT OF FORBEARANCE TOWARD BOOK- 
THIEVES has been reached by the authorities of the 
Brooklyn Public Library, whose branches have for 
years suffered considerable losses, chiefly it appears 
at the hands of mischievous or dishonest children. 
Patience and a hope of better things gave way at 
last to a sorrowful conviction that the kindest thing 
to be done, for parents and children alike, was "to 
give the would-be thieves such a thorough scare as 
might be the means of restraining them and their 
associates from getting deep into the habit of steal- 
ing till they finally ended in becoming full-grown 
criminals." Accordingly fifteen little rascals (ras- 
cals in the making) were haled into the Children's 
Court, while other cases were handled by the par- 
ents of the culprits; and "the results have been, 
that in every branch where a boy has been made an 
example of there has been a decrease in the num- 
ber of losses, missing books have been slyly returned 
to tables by children evidently startled by hearing 
of the arrests, and the effect upon the boys' habits 
has been good." The Children's Court and its wise 
and humane judges are warmly praised. We are 
glad to infer from the official report that petty 
thieving has not been practised to any great extent 
by the girls. Perhaps, however, they were more 
adroit and less easily caught in the act ; at any rate, 
they seem to have been spared the shame of public 
prosecution, but doubtless they will take to heart 
the object lesson given them that the way of trans- 
gressors is hard. ... 

A GOOD WORD FOR AMERICAN JOURNALISM was 

spoken by our late visitor, the inspiring and gifted 
Professor Gilbert Murray. Upon his departure from 
Amherst, where his lectures and talks on Greek 
literature and Greek culture gave unmeasured satis- 
faction, he expressed himself (to the ubiquitous in- 
terviewer) on sundry other subjects besides. Among 
other things, we are told that he said: "You have 
more really good newspapers than we have. In 
fact, we have rather few really good newspapers. 
Our papers used to be penny papers, but now they 
are most of them sold for a ha'penny, and they 
don 't seem to be able to get out a very high-toned 
publication for that price. I don't think we could 
produce so many liberal-minded, well-informed pa- 
pers as you do, like the Springfield 'Republican,' 
the Boston 'Transcript,' and the New York 'Even- 



ing Post.' The general tone of the papers is better 
over here, and the standard of your editorials and 
special articles is very high." Perilous always is 
. the sweetness of praise, but perhaps not much harm 
will result in this instance if due allowance is made 
for our friendly guest's natural unwillingness to say 
anything unpleasant to his entertainers as he bows 
his good-bye. Farewell speeches, like after-dinner 
oratory, are more than likely to contain consider- 
able "tail talk," and should be subjected to a very 
liberal discount. ... 

THE SALE OF THE SECOND PART OF THE HUTH 

LIBRARY is set f or June 5-7 and 10-14, at Sotheby's, 
in London. The first sale of last November cov- 
ered only items under A and B in alphabetical or- 
der, and brought a little over a quarter of a million 
dollars. This second instalment will be of about 
equal size and probably of equal or greater market 
value. Early estimates of the Huth collection's 
pecuniary worth, when the will of its late owner be- 
came the sensation of the day in the book world, 
placed it at about one million dollars. Since then 
the prices commanded at public auction by the treas- 
ures of the Hoe collection have caused a consider- 
able revision of former estimates, and now the Huth 
library is expected by some connoisseurs to realize 
more than twice the sum originally named, or even 
as much as two and one-half millions, even with the 
deduction of the fifty choicest items given by the 
testator to the British Museum. So rich a collec- 
tion of unique and of exceedingly rare literary treas- 
ures has probably never before been offered at 
public sale. The sixty thousand pounds which the 
collection is said to have cost the Huth family in 
the course of its gradual acquisition is not unlikely 
to be octupled in the total amount finally received 
at the successive sales. 



AN AUTHORS' UNION, wearing somewhat the as- 
pect of the familiar trades-union, is being planned in 
New York by prominent American writers. The 
proposed association or league will resemble the 
Author's Society of England and the Gens de Lettres 
and the Soci&t6 des Auteurs Dramatiqites of France. 
It will be a business organization for the protection 
of the pecuniary interests of its members and, in a 
general way, of literary workers as a class. The 
affairs of the society will be managed through bureaus, 
one of contracts and collections, one of legal ser- 
vice, one of general information, and so on. A lit- 
erary agency will be established. Annual meetings 
will be held by the association, and its energies will 
be directed toward such reforms as the improvement 
of copyright laws and the prevention of various forms 
of literary piracy that still prevail. Playwrights as 
well as other authors will be represented in this com- 
prehensive league for mutual defence, and it is to be 
hoped that women may share equally with men in 
the benefits to accrue from the new movement. Mrs. 
Kate Douglas Wiggin is a member of the provisional 
committee on organization. The names of many of

LITKKAKY PARALLELS might be found for certain 
forms of expression that are just now making them- 
selves exceedingly familiar all over the country. For 
example, merely as a matter of historical and literary 
interest, and without regard to other considerations, 
it is carious to note the resemblance between the fol- 
lowing two utterances, the first having as its author 
a prominent American of our own time, and the 
second occurring in the public papers of the Comte 
de Chambord, Bourbon pretender, a generation ago, 
to the throne of France. " I typify and embody the 
great cause which can only be furthered by support- 
ing me." That is the American way of putting it. 
and this is the French way: "I am the necessary 
pilot, the only one capable of guiding the ship to port, 
because I have for it a mission of authority." Again, 
in our native idiom: " Every man who believes in 
decency and honesty in politics . . . can achieve his 
purposes only by supporting my candidacy "; and in 
the French style : " With the cooperation of all honest 
men and with the grace of God I may save France, 
and I will." Not without reason did the Preacher 
affirm that " the thing that hath been, it is that which 
shall be : and that which is done is that which shall 

be done: and there is no new thing under the sun." 



A LINGUISTIC PRODIGY who can conceal his 
thought in twenty-three languages is not met with 
every day. Sir Charles Eliot, the new head of Hong 
Kong University, has in the forty-seven years of his 
life shown a remarkable aptitude for acquiring for- 
eign tongues. In his Oxford days he won highest 
distinction in the classics and also captured the Bo- 
den Sanskrit scholarship and the Syriac prize. Sub- 
sequent service as diplomat in various countries has 
enabled him to extend his familiarity with strange 
tongues until now he is credited with the command 
of twenty-three, not including such acquaintance 
with the Yankee idiom as he may have acquired 
during his secretaryship of the British Embassy at 
Washington fourteen years ago. His scholarship is 
attested by his excellent Finnish grammar, pub- 
lished in 1890. He has also held with distinction 

the vice-chancellorship of Sheffield University. 



A GENUINELY AMERICAN LITERARY SHRINE, 

which should prove a strong attraction to pilgrims, 
is the house at Hannibal, Missouri, where the great- 
est of our humorists was born, and which has re- 
cently been presented to the city of Hannibal by 
Mr. and Mrs. George A. Mahan, themselves natives 
of the same State that gave to the world Mark 
Twain. At the presentation ceremonies a bas-relief 
portrait of Missouri's most distinguished son and an 
inscribed tablet were unveiled, and school children as 
well as older persons of local prominence took part 
in the proceedings. And now, before planning one's 
pilgrimage to Stratford-on-Avon this summer, why 
not journey first to Hannibal on the Mississippi ?

SOME OUTDOOR PHILOSOPHERS.* 

It is a comfortable philosophy, that which the 
outdoor enthusiasts arrive at as a result of living 
with Nature, and one worthy of being adopted 
at least for the summer-time by anyone who can 
believe it. " Leave your office, your books, your 
cares, and even your friends," they say, " and 
go live in a tent by yourself, absorbed in the 
really vital things of life, such as growing grass 
and falling rain. Learn there that even the ques- 
tions of indoor philosophy are not to be worried 
about. Matter? What does that matter so long 
as you are sure there is a blue-bird nesting in 
yonder stub? Soul? Why do you bother about 
terms, so long as something within you thrills to 
the cardinal's whistle and the oriole's fluting? 
God? You will never find Him if not in the 
silent sunrise or the hushed radiance of sunset." 
To these philosophers the natural life of roan is 
life in the open, and cities are the excrescence of 
a mistaken civilization. 

On this subject Mr. Stan ton Davis Kirkham, 
author of "Mexican Trails," "East and West," 
"In the Open," etc., has written a thorough- 
going book which unfolds many wise and some 
witty conclusions arrived at by the philosophic 
mind in enjoying Nature. The author believes, 
like Thoreau, that a person should live in the 
present rather than in " a dead yesterday or an 
unborn tomorrow," and like Stevenson that he 
can be happy "just thinking"; that the begin- 
ning of wisdom for any man is to become ac- 
quainted, in solitude and serenity, with his 
own character, since "nothing shall bring him 
peace but himself"; that; to learn from Nature 
is not to humanize outdoor life, but " to acquire 
the bird's point of view"; and that if a person 
keeps himself open to "the Cosmic Emotion 
which is joy in spring and sadness in the autumn 
... he may find himeelf in the forties with an 
unabated relish for Nature, the same suscepti- 
bility to this mysterious magic play that he felt 
at twenty." People who love to wander afield 
and ruminate will find Mr. Kirkham expressing 
their point of view very well, especially in such 
fundamental articles of faith as this :

" Perhaps it is the very living out-of-doors, the wooing 
of the silence, that has taken the zest out of the life of 
being amused; but if I have sold all my goods for a 
single pearl, it is with the assurance that this pearl out- 
weighs the world. It has proved a good bargain, yet it 
was made because the fates compelled it made by one 
in a dream, only to find he had dreamed the immortal 
truth. When men talk of their beloved trade it would 
be of no use for me to tell them my business is on a 
larger scale and is concerned with eternal and universal 
things ; that I deal in Truth and find it more profitable 
than their feeble ventures. As for property of which we 
hear so much, if I should tell them my estate extends 
from Canada to Guatemala and of the satisfaction I have 
had in familiarizing myself with it they would not in 
the least understand. How poor would I feel if I did 
not own the mountains and the desert as poor as the 
rich themselves!" 

Of the same tenor, but more given to objective 
description, is Mr. W. S. Blatchley's "Wood- 
land Idyls," the record of some summer outings 
in western Indiana. The preface recommends 
that everyone with a week to spend betake him- 
self to the woods all alone, and live with a canvas 
cover for a roof, three bent wires for a cook- 
stove, fish and berries of his own acquiring for 
food, and a spring for a hydrant. There the sun 
will be his alarm-clock, and the whip-poor-will 
his vesper bell. Beside Racoon Creek or Walnut 
Creek the writer has spent his vacations, watch- 
ing the green heron fish, finding the prunella in 
its glen, stretching himself on the ground "with 
nose deep among the grass-roots" to inhale the 
good earthy smell and feel himself "one of the 
countless billions of parasites thus rendering 
homage unto his mother," and receiving without 
complaint the downright visits of " J. Pluvius." 
He makes such a way of life seem so easy and so 
alluring that the most hide-bound city-dweller 
must needs be convinced of its feasibility. 

The same philosophy in the main appears in 
Mr. Tickner Edwardes's "Neighbourhood," but 
modified by the writer's different experience. If 
you live in the city you must run away to enjoy 
Nature ; but if you live in a blissful little English 
village like Windlecombe, in the midst of the 
Sussex downs, where Mr. Edwardes has done 
his work " for half a life- time back, and may 
claim fairly to have won his villagership," you 
can love and cultivate Nature and your neighbors 
at the same time. "Neighbourhood, the daily 
interchange of thought and word and kindly 
deed, is a necessity for all healthy human life, 
and the natural medium of all true advancement." 
So Mr. Edwardes writes about his sturdy, hard- 
working, quaint-mannered neighbors, as well as 
about the downs, the starlings, the bees, and the 
sheep, and produces a most delightful book. 
There is an engaging chapter in which Daniel 



Dray, the old wheelwright, Tom Clemmer, father 
of the village blacksmith of the same name, and 
other ancients drop into reminiscence of their 
sweet-hearting days. One of them bears this 
unconscious witness to the fact that Ann White- 
field has her prototype: 

" ' Eighteen thousand happy days,' said he triumph- 
antly, ' agen six weeks o' rough and tumble pore 
George! Ah! Well-a-day! But 'tis so, neighbours. 
Th' Reverend, 'a figured it out fer Jane an' me laast 
catterning-time. Eighteen thou Gorm! but I should 
ha' lost 'em all, if she had n't up an* spoke out! I ne'er 
had no thought on 't, trew as th' sun goos round th' sky. 
But Jane, 'a gie me a red neckercher wan Hock-Monday. 
Thinks I, ' Wat 's that fer ? ' An' then 'a gie me a bag o' 
pea- nuts, an' sez I to mysel', ' 'Tis a queer maid surelye ! ' 
An' then 'a cooms along at harvest-time, an' sez she, 
' 'Enery Dawes, I ha' jist heerd as ould Mistus Fenny 
'ull gie up th' Malthouse Cottage at Milemas, an' seein' 
as how you warnts me an' I warnts you, 't would be a 
pity to lose it; so let's get arsted i' church directly- 
minute,' sez she. Wi' that 'a putt both arms around th' 
red neckercher, as I wore ; an' gie me wan, two, three 
each chop, an' wan i' th' middle. Lor' bless ye! Iknowed 
then what a' meant, I did ! I wur allers th' sort as could 
see through a brick wall fur as most folk : never warnted 
no more'n an 'int.' " 

Many of the author's walks are taken with 
" Reverend," the blind rector of the parish who 
sees so much through his other senses and his 
memory that he almost betters his companion's 
observation. All the traditional beauty of the 
" shy, still " English country is theirs to enjoy 
the wood-carpet of anemones and primroses in 
spring, the nightingale's song in June, the glow 
of poppies in the wheat in summer, the rich green 
of the ivy in the autumn when other color is gone. 
These are described with a vividness which makes 
it seem that the writer has added his blind friend's 
sensibility to his own keen vision. Besides the 
human element, such things as hiving the bees, 
sheep-washing, and harvest have their place in 
his regard. This is his report of the close of a 
threshing day : 

" As the sun went down behind the hills, and left the 
world afloat in wine-colored mist, every sound of work 
ceased in the village save this rich throbbing voice of 
the threshing mill up at the farm. I went out into the 
dreaming light to listen to it. From where I sat on 
the church-yard wall, I could make out that they were 
prolonging the work into the dusk, so that the last rick 
might be finished now, and the threshing gang move on 
tonight to the next farm. There was the deep sound of 
the mill itself, one tremendous baritone note succeeding 
another, each held for a moment, and then suddenly 
changing to one higher or lower in the sonorous clef. 
Apart from this, I could distinguish the fuss and fume 
of the engine, as it drove its white breath in little un- 
steady gusts up against the violet calm of the sky. And 
there was another sound the flapping song of the driv- 
ing belt a note that punctuated everything, as though 
some invisible conductor were beating time to the gen-

eral symphony. Hut the combined effect of all was 
infinitely harmonious and restful. 

Yet I had come out, in the main, to hear, not this 
familiar part of the music, but something about it that 
I loved most of all; and this was the stopping of the 
machine. It was almost dark before the last sheaf went 
to the mill, and steam was shut off. And then the won- 
derful note began. The machine took an appreciable 
time to run down. But now there was uo upward inflec- 
tion of its voice. Note by note, each note more drawn 
out and quieter, the rich tones fell through every stage 
of an octave, until they died away in the profoundest, 
softest bass. Even then I fancied I could feel the solid 
earth still shuddering with a music too deep for human 
ear." 

One can venture without fear the prediction that 
this will become a classic among Nature books, 
since it considers Nature, as it should be con- 
sidered, the setting and enhancement of human 
life. Some very charming illustrations supple- 
ment the text. 

Assuredly the weak point of most Nature books 
is their lack of humor. They are subdued in 
tone and pensive, so that they do not. take the 
strongest hold on us. Not so "The Jonathan 
Papers." These essays by Elisabeth Wood- 
bridge, which have appeared from time to time 
in the "Atlantic" or the "Outlook," go well 
together in a book, and one cannot take them 
up without thanking the Lord for humor. On 
a slight stretch they may be considered as form- 
ing a Nature book Nature with Jonathan 
thrown in ; but they so objectify and vivify the 
experiences of these two people on their " unpro- 
gressive farm " that they are first of all a human 
document. The writer is one of the outdoor 
philosophers, and not only believes in getting 
her fill of beauty but in " taking dessert first " 
and dessert means to her "to go out into the 
green beauty of the world, to fling myself down 
in some sloping meadow and feel the sunshine 
envelope me and the warm winds pass over me." 
She and Jonathan run away from the city to go 
fishing a spring day when neither of them " can 
get away "; they visit their Yellow Valley in 
March in spite of wind and mud, shoot ducks 
in the salt marshes at ten above zero, and in 
various other ways prove themselves worthy of 
the happiness of living on a farm each year, 
from April until December. On the subject of 
grooming this farm they differ. 

" ' Do you remember Jack Mason when he was mar- 
ried? Face and neck the color of raw beef from sun- 
burn, and hair cropped so close it made his head look 
like a drab egg I ' 

" ' I did n't notice,' said Jonathan. 

" ' No, I suppose not. Yon would have done the same 
thing you 're all alike. Look at hones! When men 
want to make a horse look stylish, why, chop off his 
tail, of course! And they are only beginning to learn 



better. When a man builds a house, what doe* he do? 
Cuts down every tree, every bush and twig, and makes 
it " ship shape," as you call it. And then the women have 
to come along and plant everything all over again.' 

' But things need cutting now and then,' said Jona- 
than. 'You wouldn't like it, you know, if a man never 
went to the barber's. He'd look like a woodchuck.' 

" ' There are worse-looking things than woodchucks. 
Still, of course, there 's a medium. Possibly the wood- 
chuck carries neglect to excess.'" 

On other occasions, also, Elisabeth appears as 
the champion of the natural. 

"Jonathan has nothing to do with my hens except 
to give advice. One of his hobbies is the establishing 
of a breed of hens marked by intelligence, which he 
maintains might be done by careful selection of the 
mothers. Accordingly, whenever he goes to the roost 
to pick out a victim for the sacrificial hatchet, he first 
gently pulls the tail of each candidate in turn, and by 
the dim light of the lantern carefully observes the na- 
ture of their reaction, choosing for destruction the one 
whose deportment seems to him most foolish. In this 
way, by weeding out the extremely silly, he hopes in 
time to raise the general intellectual standard of the 
barnyard. But he urges that much more might be done 
if my heart were in it. Very likely. But my heart id 
not. Intelligence is all very well, but the barnyard, I 
am convinced, is no place for it. Give me my pretty, 
silly hens, with all their aimless, silly ways. I will seek 
intelligence, when I want it, elsewhere." 

Such an one, we must echo, is a natural phil- 
osopher. And in justice we must add that she 
is also a very charming writer, since her essays 
not only sparkle with wit, but are full of de- 
scriptions of great delicacy and beauty.

THE LiURE OF THE GAR1M N. 

The general character of books on gardens 
and gardening seems to vary from year to year, 
doubtless to conform with variations of interest 
in those for whom such books are written. One 
year the garden-Jover may be in search of prac- 
tical help on the subject of hardy perennials or 
of hollyhock blights ; and in the next, his per- 
ennials may be doing so well, and his hollyhocks 
may be so thrifty, that he has time to turn to 
the history of the garden craft, or to the fillip 
that his fancy finds in the beautiful thoughts of

past flower-lovers, or to such memories of his 
own past as he may recover by the aid of the 
printed page. One year the strong appeal may 
be found in such a book as Mrs. Earle's "Old- 
Time Gardens," and another may bring such a 
treasure as Mrs. Cecil's " History of Gardening 
in England," or Miss Jekyll may have found 
time to share her boundless store of garden- 
wisdom with an eager world. They are all good 
books, the alert and practical handbooks or 
the leisurely and scholarly histories: since no 
book can lack in interest in which the processes 
by which a plant has been, or may be, brought 
from seed to seed are faithfully recounted, and 
no page can be utterly dull on which are printed 
those flower names which have always meant so 
much to mankind. 

America will never equal England in the prac- 
tice of gardening. The advantages of soil and 
climate are all with the mother-country ; and our 
own land, with its long hot summers and long 
cold winters, offers many new gardening prob- 
lems which we are yet too young to solve intel- 
ligently. Among English garden books of the 
present season, the one which seems to offer the 
most help is Miss Madeline Agar's " Garden De- 
sign in Theory and Practice." Had she signed 
her work " M. Agar," no critic would have hesi- 
tated to refer to the author as being one of the 
sons of that Adam who, in spite of his faults 
and of the " endless woe " he is accused of having 
brought upon his luckless descendants, is still the 
patron-saint of gardeners. An immense amount 
of knowledge concerning all that lies at the root 
of good gardening is evident in Miss Agar's pre- 
liminary chapters on sites, aspects, soils, fertili- 
zers, drainage, road-building, walls, hedges, 
water-supplies, etc. Then follows the more in- 
teresting section of the book, in which the good 
growing things which are to adorn the finished 
grounds are set forth in all their ageless beauty. 
Written primarily for English owners of estates 
of more or less magnitude, the book is neverthe- 
less full of helpfulness for the American owner 
of a mere fragment of an acre, since it will in- 
spire him to do his best with what he has, and 
to add field to field. 

About once a year Mr. Eben E. Rexford 
gathers together a sheaf of the notes which he 
writes for the various journals to which he is a 
constant contributor, and sends them forth in 
book form. "Amateur Gardencraft" is the 
title of his latest volume, which is concerned 
with lawn and field no less than with the garden. 
Mr. Rexford 's advice is always sound and al- 
ways clearly written, and this new volume "for 



the home-maker and garden lover" should find 
a wide field of usefulness. 

Miss Hanna Rion gives a pleasant indication 
of her attitude toward the garden in the im- 
pulsive title she has chosen for her cheerful 
book, "Let's Make a Flower Garden." She 
reveals herself on one of the first pages, where 
she says : " In all the world's classics none con- 
tain the inexhaustible lure, the enchantment, 
the dream material, to be found in seed cata- 
logues." After such an introduction, one has 
a right to look for all sorts of happy-go-lucky 
experiences and experiments; nor is one dis- 
appointed. Who ever before thought of sowing 
the freshly-spaded strips of earth between the 
blossoming rows of the strawberry-bed with 
Drummond's phlox? Yet who, reading of Miss 
Rion's success in this experiment, does not long 
to imitate her venture? What delver in the 
dirt can withhold sympathy with her assertion 
that "a garden planned for you by someone 
else would as little fit your needs as a friend's ad- 
vice would solve your own private life-riddles " ? 
And how pretty to call the plot devoted to iris 
and lilies, " Kingdom Come " ! " Let 's Make a 
Flower Garden" is an uncommonly pleasant 
and valuable little book, full of good sense and 
practical helpfulness. 

Mr. Wright's " Popular Garden Flowers " 
is the third of a trilogy of garden books to the 
making of which the author has brought much 
experience and much devotion. In this latest 
volume, he has arranged the familiar garden- 
flowers alphabetically, giving each one a chap- 
ter, in which he outlines its story, its place in 
folk-lore, its various names, with a hint of what 
the poets have had to say concerning it, and 
then a careful series of directions as to its prac- 
tical needs. The chapters on transportation and 
exhibiting are of little present use to Americans, 
who, as far as flower-shows are concerned, are 
poor to the uttermost verge of poverty; but 
perhaps they will help to ring in the better days 
that are to be in this respect. 

If it were not for her memory of the gardens 
of the Old South, sweet with the unforgotten 
scent of numberless roses, it is quite possible 
that Mrs. Georgia Torrey Drennan had never 
written her monograph on "Ever-blooming 
Roses," which would have been a great pity. 
There is sure to be wide welcome for a new 
book on the flower which has always and every- 
where reigned supreme in men's hearts ; and so 
constantly is the culture of the rose leading to 
newer and greater triumphs, that there is a con- 
stant demand for new handbooks on the subject.

Mrs. Drennan's lists are particularly valuable, 
as using the nomenclature of American growers. 
Among other features, she gives us old recipes 
for preparing the delicate confection known as 
candied rose-leaves, for the distillation of rose- 
water, and for the compounding of pot-pourri , 
all gentle occupations of more leisurely days 
which it will be well to have reinstated in the 
household. 

Mr. Henry H. Saylor dates his enrollment in 
the ancient and honorable guild of rosarians from 
the hour in which he found a well-thumbed copy 
of good old Dean Hole's 'Book about Roses" 
in an old bookshop. How many feet have been 
guided into the way of peace by that beloved 
gospel, and how many a lesser epistle has been 
inspired by that dear divine ! Mr. Saylor's little 
handbook on " Making a Hose Garden" has 
much to offer of practical suggestion. Its list of 
" Dependable Roses " is excellent, and its plan 
for a rose garden suited to the moderate purse 
and limited time which the average amateur is 
able to devote to the goddess is worthy of much 
praise. SARA ANDREW SHAFER. 



IN THE WONDERLAND OF TRAVEL..* 



The summer travel season is upon us, and with 
its advent there comes from the press a goodly num- 
ber of books to tell us where preeminently the thirst 
for romance and natural beauty and artificial won- 
ders is to be quenched. Not that any one journal of

variety of this thirst ; but it will be strange if some 
one or more out of the season's supply of such pub-

summer holiday. A half-score of the most noteworthy 
and promising of these travel books are here to be 
noted with too great brevity, perforce, but with 
cordial commendation of their several excellences. 

A chance to see the great world came somewhat 
late in life to "The Princess," as the author of 
"Traveller's Tales" exultantly calls herself, lit r 
Prince being the personified Opportunity who has 
pushed his way to her through the hedge of thorns 
and led her forth to roam over Europe for one delight- 
ful year, whose memorable incidents are chronicled 
in letters to a friend at home. Landing, with the 
"Laird" and the "Child," at Antwerp soon after the 
death of King Edward, the writer sees the sights of 
Belgium, Germany, England, Scotland, France, and 
Spain, ending her travels with a second visit to En- 
gland and a view of the coronation ceremonies, which 
she pictures in a few brisk and telling strokes of the 
pen. She has the gift of imparting novelty even to 
the hackneyed by describing it simply as she sees it 
through eyes that have been bathed in the fountain 
of youth. "To the young in spirit the world keeps 
open late," she takes pleasure in quoting at the open- 
ing of her first letter. Many illustrations, chiefly 
from photographs taken by the " Child," adorn the 
book, some chapters of which had already enjoyed 
public favor in a prominent journal before being col- 
lected and added to and issued in the present book- 
form. An excellent account of the Oberanunergau 
sacred drama, the decennial repetition of which 
luckily occurred in the summer of the writer's travels, 
occupies one chapter. The freshness and readability 
of these "traveller's tales" will arouse the interest 
even of a jaded reader. 

The brilliant splendors of color-pictures are for 
once, at least, not out of place in conveying some 
notion of the glow and the magnificence of our 
western wonderlands in the Sierra Nevada region, 
among th Rocky Mountains, and along the Grand 
Canyon of the Colorado River. "Three Wonder- 
lands of the American West," by Mr. Thomas D. 
Murphy, would be a noteworthy book even without 
its numerous reproductions of paintings by Mr. 
Thomas Moran. With these illustrations and its 
other decorative features the volume becomes a work 
of art as well as a useful guide-book and a treasury 
of first-hand information for the nature-lover and the 
tourist. Thirty-two uncolored pictures are added to 
the sixteen from Mr. Moran's brush, and three maps 
help the reader to get his bearings in the Yellowstone 
and Yosemite parks and the Grand Canyon, which 
are the " three wonderlands " chosen for detailed de- 
scription. Some further wonders of the Pacific coast 
region furnish matter for a few supplementary pages 
and pictures. A passage from Mr. Murphy's preface, 
describing his earlier incredulous attitude toward the 
alleged wonders of our great West, may strike a re- 
sponsive chord in some of his readers. He says: 

" I was only languidly interested until it chanced my good 
fortune to see several original painting* by Thomas Moran, 
the wizard who comes nearer than anything excepting a 
personal visit in presenting to the eyes the true spirit <>t

these wonderlands, and making one realize their glorious 
color and grandeur. I found myself wondering if it could 
be possible that there was such an enchanted land as he 
portrays such a land of weird mountains, crystal cataracts 
and emerald rivers, all glowing with a riot of color that 
seems more like an iridescent dream than a sober reality. 
It may be on account of this very scepticism that thousands 
ne ver see the most inspiring marvels of our own country." 

That unrivalled authority on the wonders of our 
far West and of our great national parks from whom 
Mr. Murphy takes occasion to quote at some length 
in his book, has himself just produced a volume of 
description and of personal adventure in the Cali- 
fornia paradise of the Yosemite valley. "The Yo- 
semite" Mr. John Muir calls his book, and in this 
engaging fashion it begins : 

" When I set out on the long excursion that finally led to 
California I wandered afoot and alone, from Indiana to the 
Gulf of Mexico, with a plant-press on my back, holding a 
generally southward course, like the birds when they are go- 
ing from summer to winter. . . . All the world was before 
me and every day was a holiday, so it did not seem import- 
ant to which one of the world's wildernesses I first should 
wander." 

That was in the spring of 1868, when to some of 
us all the world was young, and to others of us 
there was not yet any world at all. To Mr. Muir it 
certainly was a fresh and interesting world, and his 
account of the portion of it then first opening to his 
view catches much of the charm with which it was 
invested for him. The natural-history notes that 
occur in some abundance increase the book's value 
to the student. Maps and striking landscape views 
are generously supplied. 

A long-cherished desire on the part of Mr. Dillon 
Wallace to see some of the wilder sections of the 
Rocky Mountain region, and to visit the big game 
ranges and study the game conditions there, was at 
last gratified in the summer of 1910, when he had 
an opportunity to make a two-thousand-mile journey 
on horseback from southern Arizona to Montana, 
most of the way without guide or other companion. 
The story of this expert survey of the chief remain- 
ing haunts of our too-rapidly disappearing big game, 
with advice and suggestions as to the course to be fol- 
lowed if these denizens of the wild are not to be 
exterminated, is issued in a volume appropriately 
entitled "Saddle and Camp in the Rockies," and 
adorned with numerous illustrations from photo- 
graphs taken by the author. The ways of the 
human as well as of the animal residents of this 
vast region are touched upon by the observant soli- 
tary horseman, and his narrative, divided into twenty- 
one chapters of never wearisome length, is excellent 
reading. But those who are acquainted with his 
"Lure of the Labrador Wild" and other books of 
hunting and exploring will know well enough what 
sort of good things to expect in this latest volume. 
The serious purpose of the book, however, should 
not be lost sight of amid its attractions of passing 
anecdote and graphic description. 

Blithe was the mood of Dr. J. Johnston Abraham 
when, sentenced by his physician to a long banish- 
ment from England for his health's sake, he took 



passage in a tramp steamer for the far East. He 
himself t it appears, had been educated for the medi- 
cal profession, or at least he was a qualified surgeon, 
for in that capacity he became one of the "Cly- 
temnestra's" company when she weighed anchor at 
Liverpool and turned her prow toward Port Said, 
the first port touched in a rambling trading cruise 
in the Orient. An abundance of miscellaneous 
incident and page after page of lively conversation, 
with a multitude of camera views along the way, 
insure the reader of "A Surgeon's Log" against 
tedium. As a specimen of the author's fluent and 
unstudied style, here is a passage from a chapter 
devoted largely to Batavia: 

" It was distressingly close not a breath of air stirred. 
The heat was sweltering, and every one moped. Without 
the Chief, somehow no one seemed inclined to think of 
amusement. I busied myself taking photographs in the 
immediate neighborhood of Tanjong Priok. Once I elabo- 
rately stalked a policeman, to find, after painfully mancen- 
vring to get him into a good light, that he was itching to 
have himself snapshotted all the time, and so my wariness 
had been all unnecessary. He posed himself delightedly, 
pulling his sword well round to the front, and then demanded 
' comshaw.' A cigarette completely satisfied him." 

A happy choice of title, a liberal use of anecdote, 
historical and legendary, and a generous supply of 
pictures, are some of the leading attractions of Mr. 
Blair Jacket's "Windmills and Wooden Shoes," a 
book for the intending tourist of Holland, and 
equally enjoyable if the reader has already toured 
that country, or even if he is content to confine his 
touring to stay>at-home travels of the literary sort. 
The writer attempts no extraordinary, out-of-the-way 
excursions in his Dutch sight-seeing; perhaps there 
are no such unusual routes to be found in so small 
and densely-peopled a land. The old and familiar 
has its charm no less than the new and strange. Mr. 
Jaekel's frequent scraps of history pleasantly recall 
one's Motley, and even arouse a desire to re-read 
the stirring chronicle of little Holland's defiance of 
Spain. The occasional departures from approved 
English idiom in the pages of the book need not 
shock one; perhaps they indicate a greater famil- 
iarity with the language spoken in the land of 
windmills and wooden shoes than with that heard 
in the country of skyscrapers and the latest pattern 
of fashionable foot-gear. 

The intimacy and vivacity of private correspon- 
dence have imparted a certain liveliness and humor 
and pleasing personal tone to Miss Rosalind Travers's 
"Letters from Finland." She is best known as a 
writer of poetry, and when she undertook to produce 
a book of travel she felt somewhat at a loss how to 
go about it. "Be concrete and personal, and avoid 
generalities as you would poison," was the advice of 
a trusted friend. Naturally she found it impossible 
to follow this counsel undeviatingly in a descriptive 
work; but she kept it before her as an ideal, and 
it seems to have influenced her style in a manner 
likely to please her readers. The letters cover the 
period from August, 1908, to March, 1909, and are 
agreeably interspersed with fragments of verse, both

original and translated. As illustrating the book's 
happy blending of the concrete, sometimes .even the 
commonplace, and the sublime, we quote this from 
the middle of the volume: 

" For once I am writing to yon from one of ' the best 
hotel*' [the Cascade Hotel at Imatra]. No doubt they 
respond to aome deep-seated need of human nature, but, for 
my part, I only find them expensive and depressing. They 
charge twice as much as the smaller inns, and since neither 
the wash-stands nor the supply of hot water are doubled 
what does it benefit one ? I cannot eat twice as much food 
as usual, and I do not want a band during meals. 

" Here of course one pays for the neighbourhood of Imatra. 
Resist the temptation to call it Imatra, for, like all Finnish 
words, it has the accent on the first syllable. The renown 
of this very mighty waterfall is ancient, and has gone out 
into all lands. It is mentioned in the Kalevala by Jouka- 
hainen, ' He, the meagre youth of Lapland,' the singer who 
matched himself against Vainamoinen. . . . 

" Imatra is so magnificent that it can bear its fame, and 
not shrink when the Finns call it the finest cataract in 
Europe, for it is the overflow of a thousand lakes, the trib- 
ute of Saima and all his brethren of the north." 

Pictures from photographs, paintings, and drawings 
help the writer to interpret the beauties and the won- 
ders of Finland. 

Readers of the French poet Mistral, and of our 
own Mr. Janvier, stand in need of no solemn assur- 
ance that the Midi exerts a charm on all but the 
stolidest visitors. Still more will the visitors them- 
selves subscribe to all that Mrs. John H. Mason 
(Caroline Atwater Mason) has to say in its praise in 
her tasteful volume, "The Spell of France." It was 
not, she tells us, until she had journeyed through 
southern France that the spell of the country was 
laid upon her. From Lyons to the Mediterranean, 
and from the Riviera to the Spanish frontier, she 
conducts her readers "among the mountains and 
rivers of Old France; among the mighty remains 
of an earlier civilization; among its legend-haunted 
castles, churches, and abbeys ; among fields of olive 
and vine, and the roses and nightingales of Provence ; 
among the green pastures and sweet waters of the 
Pyrenees; under the palms and pines and orange 
groves, the sky and air of the Mediterranean." 
Description and history and personal adventure are 
judiciously mingled in Mrs. Mason's leisurely chap- 
ters. The book is one of a series, of which she has 
already written "The Spell of Italy," and like the 
previous numbers this one is profusely illustrated 
from photographs. 

The motor-car, with the good roads it has brought 
in its train, has in the last few years laid open 
Algeria, a country of magnificent distances and 
admirable highways, to the novelty-seeking tour- 
ist Mr. Charles Thomas-Stanford, F.S.A., has pro- 
duced a good book of such random sight-seeing in 
Algeria as was only made possible by this coexist- 
ence, in time and place, of the petroleum chariot 
and the macadamized road. " About Algeria " is 
the short and sufficient title of the work, with a sub- 
title indicating that attention is devoted chiefly to 
Algiers, Tlemcen, Constantino, Biskra, and Timgad. 
In the author's preliminary mention of previous book- 



writing tourists in Algeria, he asserts that "the 
guide-books to Algeria, in the English language at all 
events, are, in view of modern conditions of travel, 
hopelessly out of date," failing to note the recent 
publication of what is, in its way, an excellent up- 
to-date path-finder for the traveller, Mrs. Emma 
Hurl. a nk Ayer's fine volume, "A Motor Tour through 
Algeria." Perhaps the book is of too recent date 
to admit of mention in the later work. A note- 
worthy chapter of the latter describes the ruins of the 
public library discovered at Timgad in 1901, but not 
identified as a library until five years later, when 
the missing fragment was unearthed of a tablet as- 
cribing the founding of the institution to the Car- 
negie of his time, one Julius Quintianus Flavus 
Rogatianus, a Roman senator and a native of Tim- 
gad. The book's plentiful illustrations help to dem- 
onstrate that Algeria is indeed "a country brimful 
of interest, historical and actual." 

"This book was written for those who stay at 
home," says Mr. Lion Phillimore in presenting his 
volume of Carpathian wanderings ("In the Carpa- 
thians") to the gentle reader. Transylvania and 
Galicia and Moldavia and Wallachia are not exactly 
every-day or even every-year haunts of English and 
American travellers, so that comparatively few read- 
ers are likely to be other than those who stay at 
home, as far as the Carpathian Mountains are con- 
cerned. The book abounds in scenes and incidents 
and characters sufficiently out of the ordinary to make 
its pages inviting. The author and his companion, 
" Bobby," seem to have had a considerable taste of 
"roughing it" in the remote regions visited; but the 
beauties of the mountain scenery must have amply 
repaid them. From the abundant talk with the na- 
tives that gives liveliness to Mr. Phillimore's pages 
we are tempted to quote an amusing dialogue (but 
will merely indicate its substance) betraying a cur- 
rent conception of New York as the capital of Eng- 
land and of the United States as the centre of the 
English-speaking world. Possibly this is a bit of 
the geography of the future. A map of the Car- 
pathians, with the route followed marked in red, is 
appended to the book; but no pictures vie with the 
narrative in holding the reader's pleased attention, 
nor does any index follow to obliterate the impres- 
sion of careless spontaneity on the part of the maker 
of the book. PERCY F. BICKNELL. 



Ax important work announced for early autumn is the 
journal of Macready, the famous actor, which has been 
prepared for the press by Mr. William Toyubee. Mac- 
ready wrote up his diary with great regularity, and 
although Sir Frederick Pollock had access to the manu- 
script when preparing the " Reminiscences " that ap- 
peared two yean after Macready's death, it WHS thought 
that the time had not come for allowing the many refer- 
ences to contemporaries to be published. This veto has 
now been removed, and the coming volumes will give us 
many fresh glimpses of Bulwer Lytton, Dickens, Brown- 
ing, Forster, Sir Theodore Martin, and other members 
of Macready's brilliant circle.

LIGHT ON THE DARK CONTINENT.* 

To the European reader the Dark Continent pre- 
sents interests predominantly commercial and polit- 
ical in their origin and force, with the added zest of 
propinquity. To the American reader, on the other 
hand, the lines of interest are historical, racial, and 
in a unique way idealistic as evidenced hy the 
founding of Liberia, the Stanley relief expedition, 
and the missionary enterprises of American origin; 
while to these is added somewhat of the charm and 
attraction of the unknown and distant though the 
racial problems which the Ethiopian raises are ever 
within our doors. It is significant of the revival of 
interest in things African that this season sees so 
large a grist of books dealing with various phases 
of African life. Seven of the eight books here dealt 
with are of British authorship, and but one is writ- 
ten by an American. They view the land from many 
angles, from the points of view of the sportsman, 
explorer, administrator, or journalist, of friend or 
critic of British rule. 

A compact handbook of Africa copiously drawn 
from the "Encyclopaedia Britannica" (with due ac- 
knowledgements) and other sources, supplemented 
by a modicum of personal observation (apparently 
in Egypt) has been prepared by Dr. J. K. Goodrich. 
It is largely historical, descriptive, and statistical, 
forming a useful compilation of facts regarding 
Africa. Several chapters of general nature are of

especial interest. These deal with the effect of Eu- 
ropean occupation as seen in the slave trade ; with 
the Congo atrocities and other phases of commercial 
exploitation ; with the liquor traffic ; with the inborn 
laziness of the native, savage or educated, and his 
failure to accumulate property ; with the railway, of 
which the untutored savage makes immediate and 
abundant use. The need of an adequate economic 
foundation based on agriculture and technical edu- 
cation is urgent. Ultimately the author believes the 
continent must be a " White Man's Africa." Details 
of the appropriation of African territory by European 
powers, and the readjustments in progress or pend- 
ing, are set forth ; and we are given an account of 
the Cape-to-Cairo railway project. The author has 
compiled a helpful bibliography of over a hundred 
titles, covering especially the recent works on the 
subject. 

The most forbidding part of the Dark Continent 
is the Great Kalahari Desert, where a few scattered 
Bushmen and wretched Hottentots eke out a miser- 
able existence. A picture of the wild life of these 
sandy wastes is to be found in Mr. Arnold W. Hod- 
son's "Trekking the Great Thirst." The author's 
duties as sub-inspector of the Bechuanaland Protec- 
torate Police brought him into close contact with the 
native population, and gave him exceptional facilities 
for sport and travel through this little-frequented land. 
The main duties of the office which he held appear 
to have been the collection of the annual " hut tax " 
and the settlement of occasional tribal disputes. Be- 
yond checking destructive internecine warfare and 
regulating the destruction of big game, the govern- 
ment appears to render little service to the native 
peoples of these desert wastes in return for this tax, 
whose main purpose appears to be to stimulate or 
compel the native to labor for the white man. Judg- 
ing from descriptions and photographs, the term 
"hut tax" is severely stretched in applying it to the 
wretched wind-breaks of twigs and grass which the 
Bushmen call their homes. The writer fills his narra- 
tive of official tours with much detail of sport with 
hartebeeste, kudu, spring bok, and eland, and of ad- 
venture with leopards and the more formidable king 
of beasts. Not less exciting are his tales of the great 
desert, of lost spoor and parched pan where the 
wandering denizens of the desert were once wont to 
drink at night. It is a very vivid picture of desert 
travel and sport, of the wild life of shimmering tree- 
less wastes and of the untutored savage, which Mr. 
Hodson leaves in the mind of his reader. His illus- 
trations are abundant and unique in character. 

Miss Marguerite Roby's account of her "Adven- 
tures in the Congo" is a book of wholly different 
character from Mr. Hodson's, though she too was in 
search of sport. She traversed the wilds of Central 
Africa to the north of Rhodesia on a bicycle, alone 
except for native porters, starting at the rail end 
of the northern extension of the Cape-to-Cairo line 
and skirting the eastern margin of Belgian Congo, 
emerging by way of Lake Victoria at Mombasa,

exhausted by fever and stricken with blindness. 
Her main theme is a denial of the atrocities in the 
Congo attributed to the Belgians. Her attitude is 
significantly portrayed in these words: "When the 
conquering white enters a black country, labour he 
must and will have, let the theorists rave as they 
will." She evidently acted upon this belief in her 
treatment of her blacks, for she seems to have ap- 
plied the chicotte to their bare backs on the slight- 
eat provocation, continuing this policy to the bitter 
end, and in spite of the fact that desertion, treach- 
ery, and sinister plot increased as she progressed on 
her journey. She quite fails to appreciate the sig- 
nificance of her one faithful boy, Thomas, in whose 
training the lash had no part. She saw no mutila- 
tions in her short journey on the edge of the rubber 
district; she interviewed Belgian officials for her in- 
formation, and attributes the reported mutilations 
to native customs (doubtless a contributory factor). 
But, according to her own story, she was sick and 
even delirious during much of her transit of the 
Belgian territory. Her inadequately-founded con- 
clusions might carry more weight had she not so 
flagrantly disregarded the canons of tropical travel 
in reckless exposure to fever, the tsetse fly, and noon- 
day heat, as well as in the use of liquor; and had 
she not permitted a certain element of exaggeration 
to creep into her pages. The illustrations accom- 
panying her narrative are excellent. 

The hunting expedition, or "safari," of a London 
barrister and an American sportsman in British East 
Africa round about M t . Kenai is described in Mr. R. 
Gorell Barnes's " Babes in the African Wood," a 
misleading title, for the enterprise was by no means 
infantile in proportions or success, and much of the 
hunt was carried on not in the woods but in grassy 
uplands. The author portrays vividly the long march, 
the cautious trekking, the patient watch by night for 
the return of the lion to his "kill," and the more 
dangerous and exciting stalk of the elephant in the 
j ungle or of the wily " rhino " and treacherous buffalo. 
The work is written in entertaining style, with occa- 
sional lapses into jingling verse, and is abundantly 
illustrated from photographs often mediocre in quality 
and inadequately reproduced. An excellent chapter 
discusses outfitting for big-game hunting in East 
Africa, with details as to what to provide and where 
to buy it, and advice as to the qualifications and short- 
comings of the various tribes who serve as porters, 
gun-carriers, and stalkers. 

The sportsman or naturalist desiring to obtain a 
comprehensive account from authentic sources of 
the game animals, large and small (including even 
birds, reptiles, and fishes), of Africa will do well to 
consult Major R. Stevenson-Hamilton's "Animal 
Life in Africa." The author has spent many years 
in travel and sport in tropical Africa, and since 1902 
has been Warden in charge of the game preserve* 
for the Transvaal Government. His opportunities 
for first-hand knowledge of his subject are unique, 
for he spent nine years "not in hunting but in living 



among wild animals, studying their habits, and watch- 
ing them gradually loose their intense fear of man." 
The writer is catholic in his views, and a noticeable 
candor pervades his pages. 

" Experience teaches that however incredible some narra- 
tive may appear at first night, it may really be a perfectly 
correct description of what took place ; and therefore the 
wider knowledge a man has of wild beasts and their ways, 
the less prone is he to disbelieve anything he may hear con- 
cerning them. Man, even savage man, is utterly outside the 
economy of wild life. There exists among the beasts of the 
forest a sort of freemasonry, to which he, and to some ex- 
tent his domestic animals also, are strangers. The observer 
little by little becomes conscious of this, and the longer he 
studies wild animals in their native haunts the more forcibly 
does he realize his ignorance of the motives which often con- 
trol their individual and collective actions." 

An exceptionally high ethical standard (if one may 
apply such a term to any phase of the bloody busi- 
ness of hunting) is revealed in his treatment of the 
principles which should control the sportsman. He 
condemns the use of inadequate weapons, and of 
shooting unless one is certain of a reasonable chance 
of securing his quarry; and he is scathing in his 
estimate alike of the pot-hunter and of the so-called 
scientific collector who is a mere accumulator or who 
uses his license for profit-making. An extensive 
and detailed account of camp equipment and pro- 
cedure, of the sportsman's outfit, and of independent 
travel in the wilds is given in the closing chapters. 
Appendices give in full the game laws and regula- 
tions for the various British dependencies in Africa. 
Several good maps, numerous photographs taken in 
the field, and a full index add to the value of the 
work. Colonel Theodore Roosevelt contributes a 
" foreword." The growing custom, followed in this 
book, of decapitalizing scientific names is to be de- 
plored. 

The remaining three books of our group deal with 
Nigeria and the Gold Coast, fever-stricken wastes 
of swamp, jungle, forest, and desert, which, thanks 
to the services of the Liverpool School of Tropical 
Medicine, are now open not only to trade and com- 
merce but to primitive forms of travel for those who 
are duly inducted into the necessary hygienic pre- 
cautions. British and French administration have 
brought order and safety for the wayfarer in all but 
the remotest corners of this ancient home of the 
slave-driver. Major Tremearne's volume entitled 
" The Tailed Head-Hunters of Nigeria" is based on 
seven years' experience as administrator in the re- 
mote wilds of Nigeria, among savage tribes upon 
whom allegiance to British authority rests but lightly 
and intermittently. A military atmosphere pervades 
the work, and the author is no disciple of Grotius, 
much less a defender of arbitration. He is, rather, 
a modern representative of the "old fighting spirit

handed seized the trade and grasped the n-ins of 
power of a continent With the sociological, educa- 
tional, and intellectual invasion of Africa he has less

"We are unfortunately educating the natives upon Euro- 
pean lines, and the results are disastrous. A Filani chief 
who is proud of his rank is a man no one can help admiring ; 
the ex-canoe boy with a smattering of Latin inspires one only 
with contempt. Our cantonments, too, are built according to 
English ideas, and we have spoiled the beauty of many a spot 
noted before for its loveliness. I suppose West Africa will 
some day be as safe as Ireland. A very desirable state of affairs 
for the Government, perhaps, but heavens! how dreary! " 

The writer is of a scientific turn of mind, and intro- 
duces not only a narrative of his more exciting ad- 
ventures among these savage and often warlike 
peoples, but devotes most of his book to an account 
of the social economy, superstitions and customs, 
music, dancing, occupations, head-hunting propensi- 
ties, modes of travel, and folk-lore of the savage 
tribes of Northern Nigeria. Head-hunting is, or was, 
much the fashion among the warriors, and tails are 
still de rigueur for the women after marriage. These 
are not, however, of an anatomical nature, but rather 
curious constructions of beads and brass, often with 
a little iron bell added. 

Captain Hay wood's "Through Timbuctoo and 
across the Great Sahara" is a vivid picture of the 
rapid journey of an English officer, familiar with 
West African travel, from Freetown in Sierre Leone 
along the Upper and Middle Niger to Timbuctoo 
and thence across the desert wastes of the Sahara to 
Algiers. The writer is evidently an experienced 
and observant traveller, keen to note whatever is 
novel and significant along his path, and he wields 
a facile pen in relating his narrative. He tells us 
much of sport, native customs, natural features, and 
the social, political, and economic features of the 
tribes with whom he came in contact. The most 
interesting and novel part of his story is his account 
of his trip from Timbuctoo to Algiers across the 
Sahara by camel, a race with thirst, and (at the 
season of his expedition) with death itself, for wells 
are few and far between, yield at the best but scanty 
supplies of water, and may go dry. A single mis- 
hap such as a straying camel, a broken waterskin, 
or an exhausted well, and the caravan comes to an 
untimely end. Marvellous indeed is the skill of the 
Arab guide in finding his way across these trackless 
wastes of shifting sand, and no less wonderful the 
instinct of the camel which leads him to the well. 
The author's vivid style and characteristic photo- 
graphs render his account of the desert very inter- 
esting and realistic. 

A newspaper woman's account of a trip for "copy" 
along the coast of West Africa through Sierre Leone, 
Liberia, the French Ivory Coast, and the Gold Coast 
into German Togoland is to be found in Mrs. Mary 
Gaunt's "Alone in West Africa." Much to the ter- 
ror of District Commissioners on whom the responsi- 
bility of her safe conduct fell, she performed the 
seemingly impossible feat of going by land with por- 
ters along this coast instead of by the usual trading 
steamers. It is not an encouraging report which she 
gives of conditions in Liberia, "where the black man 
rules." Monrovia, the capital city, is without roads, 
and almost hidden by weeds and the jungle. A 



footpath leads to the Liberian College, and no one 
dreams of sanitation. The country lives on duties 
levied on goods in transit to and from the hinter- 
land, but local enterprise is wholly stifled in the 
ignorance and sloth of the descendants of slaves who 
misrule the land. The retrogression of Liberia is 
the more marked by reason of the prosperity and 
sanitation of other West African towns under Brit- 
ish, French, and German rule. The author praises 
most the thrift and enterprise noticeable in the Ger- 
man dependencies, where the methods of modern 
science are applied with thoroughness and often with 
a rigor to which the native is quite unwonted. This 
backwardness of the English settlements in contrast 
with those of the French, and especially the German, 
calls forth repeated comment. Miss Gaunt's book 
is unique among those here reviewed in the historical 
atmosphere which pervades its pages. She tells us 
that in the days of slave-trader and buccaneer, when 
Fever was unchallenged monarch of the Gold Coast, 
there sprang into intermittent notoriety along this 
shore a chain of forts or castles of English, French, 
Portuguese, and Danish origin, whose cemeteries 
filled faster than their courts or dungeons. Now they 
are all abandoned, and the trailing creepers of the 
jungle entwine their battlements, and shifting sands 
obliterate their defences. Quinine and the mosquito 
net are conquering the Guinea Coast, and the quest 
for rubber is opening the jungle where the search 
for gold failed. CHARLES ATWOOD KOFOID.

The tragical history of Anne Boleyn should pro- 
vide excellent material for a historical novel, and 
it has been turned to good account by Mrs. Mary 
Hastings Bradley in her ironically entitled "The 
Favor of Kings." Mrs. Bradley has been for several 
years one of the most successful American writers 
of short stories, but the present venture is her first 
work of considerable length. It is written in a spirit 
of high seriousness, intent upon portraying with close 
historical truth the character of the ill-starred queen,

and of reproducing the very form and pressure of 
the age and country in which her lot was cast. The 
work has been done in the most conscientious man- 
ner, and represents the labor of five or six years, 
during which period the subject has been studied not 
only in the light of the standard histories, but with 
constant reference to the sources. Every recorded 
word of Anne's own writing, as well as every say- 
ing attributed to her by others, has been carefully 
weighed, and, wherever possible, incorporated into 
the narrative. The State papers of the reign, the 
correspondence of the King, the Spanish ambassa- 
dors, the French court, and the Papal agents, the 
works of the old English chroniclers, have all been 
drawn upon for primary and collateral material, and 
used with skilful effect. A few inconsequential lib- 
erties have been taken, and are admitted, but in the 
main the work is faithful to fact, and will bear the 
scrutiny of the experts. The way in which the actual 
words of Anne and others are introduced into the 
dialogue is admirably artistic, and the feeling of 
romance is blended with the truth of history in a 
fashion to deserve very high praise. The method 
above suggested would, in the hands of a less expe- 
rienced writer, be likely to result in an obviously 
artificial construction ; the joints of the framework 
would be too clearly in evidence, and the brocades 
would hang too stiffly. We get almost nothing of this 
from Mrs. Bradley 's deft cabinet work and investi- 
ture, but instead examples of living and breathing 
portraiture in a setting which suffers neither from 
over-elaboration nor from a pedantic insistence upon 
non-essentials. "I have tried to paint," says the 
author, -ami to offer the Anne Boleyn of this story, a 
very human girl, gay and fearless and rashly proud, 
as the likeness of that Anne who dared and lost so 
long ago and whose blood was the first of any woman 
to stain an English scaffold." It would have been pain- 
fully easy, after the fashion of the Wardour Street 
school of historical fiction, to bedeck this narrative 
with rhetorical fustian and to bedew its course with 
tearful sentiment; we notice with relief that Mrs. 
Bradley has resorted to neither of these cheap 
devices, but has instead kept a high artistic aim well 
in sight as the tragedy inexorably develops and 
deepens to its close. We feel that the most episodical 
material introduced makes its contribution to the 
unity of the whole action, and the sense of tragic 
doom that comes with the closing chapters is like a 
storm-cloud that has been steadily gathering from 
the days of Anne's blithe and light-hearted maiden- 
hood when she came to England from the French 
court, not unsophisticated, to see, to conquer, to win 
for herself the proudest rank the world could offer, 
and to realize in her downfall the vanity of all 
worldly ambitions. The chapters which bring her 
career to an end are made very fine indeed by the 
insight and power that they reveal, by their effect 
of artistic consummation, and by the distinction of 
their style. Much is to be expected from a writer 
whose first book exhibits such qualities as are to be 
found in "The Favor of Kings." 



Middle-class society in an Ohio town of moderate 
size is minutely pictured by Miss Dorothy Canfield 
in "The Squirrel Cage." It is a microcosm of 
American society in general; at least, of that sec- 
tion thereof which feeds its idealism upon "The 
Ladies' Home Journal," and its ambitions and its 
antics are vividly suggested by the metaphor of the 
title. Into this environment Lydia Emery is plunged, 
after she is "finished" at a fashionable school and 
has had a year of foreign travel. Now Lydia is a 
nice girl, who has some notion of the things that 
really matter, but she is not strong enough to assert 
her individuality until society has worked its mis- 
chief upon her. She is persuaded and cajoled into 
accepting the husband that her environment has 
predestined for her, a pushing and successful busi- 
ness man to whom the conventions of " the squirrel 
cage" are social principles not to be questioned. 
Meanwhile, a real man, who has flouted convention, 
and learned to support himself by his own hands, is 
there in the background, and is clearly the one whom 
Lydia ought to have married. After several years 
of a mismated existence, the husband is killed in an 
accident, and the wife is left with one child in fact 
and another in prospect. She is morbidly convinced 
that she will not outlive the birth of the second child, 
and determines to entrust them both to the guardian- 
ship of the man who has turned his back upon 
society, hoping thereby to save their future from the 
dreary round of existence in "the squirrel cage." 
Fortunately, her fears are not realized, and she is 
spared to shape for them and for herself a saner 
mode of existence than that which has well nigh 
proved her undoing. Miss Canfield understands the 
folly of the sham and artificiality that clog most 
human lives, and satirizes it most effectively in her 
description. The picture is perhaps over-elaborated, 
but its truthfulness is beyond question. 

Miss Katherine West, returning to her home in 
Westville, Indiana, after completing her education, 
which has included the study of law, finds Dr. "NV >t, 
her father, under indictment for bribery in connec- 
tion with the construction of the municipal water- 
works system of which he has been in charge. He is 
one of the most highly-respected of Westville's citi- 
zens, enjoying the complete confidence of the com- 
munity, but the evidence that he has accepted money 
is convincing, and his plea that he thought the money 
a contribution to one of his philanthropical enter- 
prises seems too flimsy to be considered. The case 
goes against him, and he is convicted and sent to 
prison. Thus opens Mr. Scott's " Counsel for the De- 
fence." Then Katherine gets busy, suspecting a deep- 
laid conspiracy having its roots in a morass of polit- 
ical corruption, and determines to reopen the case 
and secure her father's rehabilitation. She gropes 
vainly about for evidence, but at length conies upon 
a clue, which she follows persistently to the cn<l, 
revealing the whole conspiracy, and accomplishing 
her father's release. Her chief ally is the editor of 
a local newspaper, who has been particularly violent 
in his denunciation of Dr. West, but who is honest,

although brutal in his methods. Katherine is at first 
repelled by him, then attracted, and finally a love- 
story of considerable intensity develops between 
them. His somewhat old-fashioned notions of what 
a woman should be and how she should comport 
herself are rudely shocked by Katherine's activities, 
but he makes a graceful surrender when he realizes 
how effective her methods have been. The story is 
bluntly told, with a well-appointed plot and much 
dramatic force, and shows much intimacy with the 
sort of corruption, born of an alliance between busi- 
ness and politics, which is a festering sore in the life 
of so many American cities. 

" Fate Knocks at the Door " is Mr. Will Levington 
Comfort's third novel, and again he impresses us 
by the opulence of his diction, by the range of his 
thought and observation, and by the intensity with 
which his characters are delineated and his situations 
unfolded. The underlying plan of the book is sug- 
gested by the structure of the symphony, and its 
four parts correspond to the four movements of the 
traditional sonata-form, being described by the con- 
ventional terms. In this there seems to be more of 
artifice than of reality, and if the table of contents 
did not give such a direction to our thoughts, the plan 
would not otherwise be apparent. That the writer 
has a deep sense of the power and significance of 
music is, however, made evident by many passages 
which could not have been written by one who had 
not felt music to be the most searching of agencies 
for the interpretation of life. It is through an ac- 
quaintance with the C minor symphony of Beethoven 
that the hero finds himself and comes to an under- 
standing with humanity, while the motto of that work, 
So pocht das Schicksal an die Pforte, supplies his 
story with a title. An even more appropriate title 
might have been borrowed from the closing words 
of "Faust," 

" Das Ewigweibliche 
Zieht uns hinan," 

for the book is essentially a paean in praise of woman- 
hood as the source of all spiritual beauty, and as the 
inspirer of everything in character that is lovely and 
of good report. Although of American origin, An- 
drew Bedient has been cast upon the world in child- 
hood, and by the time he is a young man has gained 
a rich experience of life on the seven seas, in the 
Philippines, in Kashmir, in Australia, and in the 
lands of the Caribbean. The Bible and the Bhagavad- 
Gita have been almost his only books when he makes 
his acquaintance with American fiction. 

"The love of man and woman which the stories in gen- 
eral exploited, struck him of Indian ideals as shifty and 
pestilential. The woman of fiction was equipped with every- 
thing to make her as common as man. She was glib, pert, 
mundane, her mind a chatter-mill, a creatiire of fur, paint, 
hair, and absurdly young. The clink of coins was her most 
favorable accompaniment, and her giving of self was a sort 
of disrobing formality. The men who pursued her were 
froward and solicitous. There was something of sacrilege 
about it all. The minds and souls of real women -such 
were not matters for American story; and yet the Americans 
wrote with dangerous facility. Bedient, who worshipped 
the abstraction, Womanhood, felt his intelligence seared, 



calcined. . . . Only here and there was a bit of real litera- 
ture usually by a woman. The men seemed hung up to 
dry at twenty-five. There was no manhood of mind." 
In contrast to this conception of woman, we have 
the hero's own, which is thus formulated: 

" I believe that woman is the bread-giver, spiritual and 
material ; that it is she who conserves the ideals and rewards 
man for fineness and power when she has a chance. But 
I also believe that woman must conquer in herself the 
love of luxury, her vanity, her fierce competition for worldly 
position if only for the disastrous effect of such evils upon 
men. They force him to lower his dreams of her, who should 
be high-priestess. ... It is woman who has turned the brute 
mind of the world from war, and woman will turn the furi- 
ous current of the race to-day from the pits of trade, where 
abides the twentieth century lie." 

In the face of such an idealism as this, how pitiful 
appears the ambition of women to achieve the vote, 
or to force themselves into the occupations which 
belong to men ! There is a great deal of rhapsodiz- 
ing in this book, and it clogs the plot considerably, 
but a plot there is, and a fairly interesting one. It 
chiefly concerns Bedient, and the young woman ar- 
tist, Beth Truba, predestined to be his soul-mate. 
He finds her in New York, and the conquest, though 
difficult, is complete. Bedient has large possessions 
in Equatoria, which is a Spanish island-republic in 
the Carribean, and the narrative acquires swift dra- 
matic action and vivid coloring in the closing chap- 
ters, which deal with an abortive revolution in that 
toy state. It is like the whirlwind finish of Mr. 
Comfort's last year's novel, with the rumblings of 
Mont Pel^e for a chorus. The mysticism with which 
this book is more than tinged is not unpleasant, and 
gives it a special distinction. The style is at times 
affected to the point of turgidity, but at its best 
strikingly poetical and full of pregnant meanings. 

The sort of scientific sensationalism which was 
made popular in fiction by Jules Verne, and of 
which Mr. H. G. Wells has been one of the most 
successful exponents in more recent years, has been 
resorted to in "The Second Deluge," by Mr. Garrett 
P. Serviss, the well-known popularizer of astro- 
nomical knowledge. The book tells of one Cosmo 
Versal, astronomer and physicist, who observes a 
slight dimming of the stars in a certain quarter of 
the heavens, and who, by means of a special spec- 
troscope of his own invention, is enabled to prove 
that aqueous vapor is the cause of the obscuration. 
From these facts he concludes that a vast watery 
nebula has strayed into the solar system, and that 
the earth is making straight for it. It means con- 
densation sufficient to envelope the globe with a 
film of water six miles deep, and the consequent 
extinction of all the land fauna, mankind included. 
Although Versa" Fs predictions are supported by the 
most cogent reasoning, his warnings to the learned 
societies and governments of the world go unheeded, 
and he becomes an object of derision. He advises 
people everywhere to build arks while there is yet 
time, and himself sets the example by constructing 
an enormous vessel of levium fa newly-discovered 
metal), capable of providing accommodations for 
one thousand people. When the disaster becomes

imminent, this ark is the sole refuge of humanity. 
and it is filled with selected guests, representative 
of what is best worth preserving of the human race, 
besides being stocked with animals. As the earth 
nears the outer spirals of the nebula, there are pro- 
digious portents, and when the deluge comes, the ark 
floats on the waters, and is navigated over the sub- 
merged continents, until it floats above the crest of 
the Himalayas. All of the race has perished except 
the remnant inVersaTsark, a few forehanded French- 
men who have escaped in a submarine, and a group 
of refugees in Colorado, who have been saved by a 
fortunate "batholite," or forcing up of the earth's 
crust in that region by pressure from beneath. Mr. 
Serviss shows great inventiveness in the development 
of this story of a twentieth-century Noah, and his 
book is a fair match to Mr. Wells's romance, " In 
the Days of the Comet." The story ends with the 
beginnings of a new organization of human society 
in the Rocky Mountain region, at a time when the 
absorption of the waters has once more brought 
Mount Everest and the Thibetan plateau above the 
surface. 

Those who remember pleasantly "The Colonel of 
the Red Huzzars" and "The Princess Dehra," by 
Mr. John Reed Scott, will welcome the entertain- 
ment provided in "The Last Try," which tells of 
the later fortunes of some of the characters in those 
romantic inventions. The story is dated five years 
after the successful establishment of Dehra and her 
American consort upon the throne of Valeria, and 
the discomfiture of the pretender Lotzen. It tells 
of Lot/en's last desperate effort to gain his ends, in- 
cluding several attempts to assassinate the King, the 
kidnapping of the Princess, her exciting rescue, and 
the sword conflict in which Lotzen pays the final 
penalty for his misdeeds. The scene of the ear- 
lier chapters is in Washington, but the action is 
soon transferred to Valeria, where the atmosphere 
becomes thick with plot and counterplot, with 
intrigue, conspiracy, and exciting adventure. It is 
all stuff of a very artificial sort, but fairly good of 
its kind. 

Mr. Burton Stevenson is one of our most success- 
ful spinners of detective yarns, and his "Mystery 
of the Boule Cabinet " holds the attention unrelaxed. 
That villainous piece of furniture is guilty of several 
baffling murders, for it has two secret drawers, and 
one of them is protected by a spring which injects 
hydrocyanic acid into the knuckles of those who fool 
with it. whereupon they keel over and die. This is 
the device of Crochard the Invincible, genius among 
French criminals, who has stolen the Michaelovitch 
diamonds and hidden them in the protected drawer. 
He then contrives to have the cabinet shipped to 
America to the address of a well-known collector of 
antiques, and, himself following, indulges in various 
machinations to recover possession of it He finally 
gets away with the jewels, to the discomfiture of 
the French police agents, whom he tricks most inge- 
niously and outrageously. 



Mr. Leonard Merrick is an English novelist, hav- 
ing a dozen or more books already to his cn-<lit. \\ h< 
ha- been winning golden opinions from discriminat- 
ing critics, and who certainly deserves a wider popu- 
larity than he has hitherto enjoyed with American 
readers. The publisher who has recently undertaken 
to introduce him in this country has just put forth 
"The Position of Peggy," a new work, and "The 
Actor-Manager," one not quite so new. Both are 
concerned with the theatre in England and with the 
lives of the player- folk. The subject is one that Mr. 
Merrick knows through and through, and he -Iral- 
with it sympathetically. His method is that of un- 
affected simplicity and naturalness, a method which 
is content to give a plain transcript of real conditions, 
and which aims neither at ingeniously strained situ- 
ations, nor at sensational effects. The actors who 
are Mr. Merrick's heroes and heroines are in no way 
showy persons of widely-advertised fame, but humble 
members of the profession who find it hard to make 
a bare living, and who know at first hand the full 
meaning of the struggle with poverty. In each of 
the novels before us we are concerned with a man 
and two women. One woman is the wrong one, with 
whom the man gets entangled before he is old enough 
to make a wise choice, and the other is the right one, 
who saves him from the error of his youth. In " The 
Position of Peggy," there is a long engagement, 
broughtabout and kept up by the chivalry of the hero, 
but it does not lead to marriage, because Peggy's heai 1 
is turned by her success in musical comedy, and she 
turns from her former lover to one of her gilded 
admirers, which leaves the former free to follow the 
promptings of his heart In "The Actor-Manager," 
the hero marries one of his associates, only to discover 
that she is vain, selfish, and worldly, which means 
a hopeless clash between her ideals and his own. A 
divorce smoothes the path for the woman whom the 
hero has come to love, and the curtain goes down 
upon a prospect of happiness to come. One passage 
in this book is so timely, as expressing the aims and 
ideals of those who are now engaged in the Herculean 
task of making the stage a vital influence for good 
upon our modern life, that it deserves quotation. It 
is the vision of the "actor-manager" for whom the 
book is named. 

" I see a small theatre, and at this theatre the one literary 
medium for the drama is n't held to be the baldest prose ; 
poetry is neither divorced from the stage, nor limited to 
Shakespeare it is thought possible to test the work of a 
poet who has not had centuries of advertising! But the 
realist is as welcome as the poet; oh, he is welcome! Only 
the plays are literature, and they are real plays. The men 
and women live ! They are not puppets pulled by inexorable 
strings through four acts to a conventional end. Reward 
for virtue and punishment for vice are shown to exist in the 
soul, and not in material success and failure. To depict the 
world as a school, where virtue wins the prize and vice gets 
a flogging, is immoral. The parts around me aren't written 
down to bring my part into greater prominence. The 
dramatist who comes to me is free ; free to be true to his 
own convictions and his art; free to choose his characters 
where he will, and to trace their legitimate development, free 
to make the 'lost* woman noble, and the 'godly' woman 
vile for such things are ! and the love within him for

all humanity would point the moral when it needed pointing. 
The real playwright is your real optimist your real Christ- 
follower, for he shows that sin doesn't mean damnation, and 
that there is redemption for the pure in heart. The one 
command laid upon him is to see things nobly that his 
deeper vision shall help the crowd." 

The Irish humorist known as "G. A. Birming- 
ham," who was introduced to the American public 
a few months ago by the republication of a group of 
three of his novels, "Spanish Gold," "The Search 
Party," and "Lalage's Lovers," reviewed in our 
issue of Feb. 16 last, now claims our attention for 
a fourth book, "The Simpkins Plot." Here, as in 
"Spanish Gold," we make the acquaintance of the 
Reverend J. J. Meldon, curate of Ballymoy, and 
his friend, Major Kent. The parson, who is as 
audaciously resourceful as ever, finds an object for 
his dark devices in an attractive young woman whom 
he meets on a railway train, bound like himself for 
Ballymoy. She is in reality an inoffensive woman 
of letters, a niece of Sir Gilbert Hawkesby, and has 
taken an Irish country house for the summer, in 
order that she may have a quiet place for her work. 
But it so happens that she closely resembles a mur- 
deress who has been acquitted only the day before 
by an emotional jury, in the face of a terrific charge 
by Sir Gilbert himself. The parson, having seen 
illustrated newspaper reports of the case, mistakes 
his travelling companion for the murderess, and, en- 
gaging her in conversation, seeks to draw her out. 
He becomes quite convinced of the identification, and 
when he learns, on reaching Ballymoy, that the peace 
of the place has recently been disturbed by the doings 
of a meddlesome government inspector named Simp- 
kins, who has become very unpopular in the com- 
munity, he sets about planning ways and means for 
the removal of this inconsiderate intruder. Believ- 
ing that the young woman is guilty of the murder 
of her husband, and assuming that she would cheer- 
fully murder another, having "got away" with her 
first experiment in crime, he determines that Simp- 
kins shall be persuaded to make love to her. If the 
match is accomplished, it will prove a convenient 
and expeditious way of ridding the village of his 
undesired presence. The rest of the story deals 
with his devices for bringing the two together, and 
for getting them interested in one another. Unfor- 
tunately for the parson's hopes, the Major himself 
becomes enamored of the young woman, and when 
Sir Gilbert himself appears upon the scene, the 
guest of his niece, the whole imaginative fabric upon 
which the plot is based crumbles to the ground, 
and Simpkins is saved, from matrimony if from 
nothing worse. The whole farcical situation is 
handled with great skill, and with much joyous exhi- 
bition of the humors of Irish character. The par- 
son is the same loquacious, audacious, and inventive 
person who figured in "Spanish Gold," and it is 
refreshing to be once again in his society. This 
irresponsible light-hearted comedy is an ideal book 
for the lazy summer hours.

on Nature and out-door life selected from Walt 
Whitman's poems and diaries. Much has been said 
of Whitman's curious blending of egoism with the 
sense of brotherhood ; his more intemperate disciples 
have written of his resemblance to Christ ; and hostile 
critics have attacked his exhibitionism and his indif-

has done pithily and charmingly, in an Introduction 
contributed to the present volume. In these varied 
and well-chosen selections, Whitman speaks in his 
own person, watching "God's calm annual drama" 
with never-failing sympathy and receptivity. Insect 
and bird, tree and flower, dawn and twilight, noon 
and night, sea and land, and the inscrutable "rolling 
earth " itself, all are represented here, and before all 
of them Whitman stands fervid yet reverent, seek- 
ing to read "the unspoken meanings of the earth." 
In this reading, Whitman, like his contemporary 
Thoreau, was greatly aided (and hindered at times, 
no doubt) by his delicate and powerful sensuousness. 
With him, the sense of smell, for instance, normally 
the most sluggish of the senses, was extremely active. 
There is an "exquisite smell of the earth at day- 
break," and the night has a " natural perfume belong- 
ing to the night alone." The odor of apples, of the 
cedar, and of Indian corn, pervades many of his pages. 
Corn when gathered has an aroma "rich, rare, ripe, 
peculiar," and at night is "just-palpable." He was 
fond of just-palpable odors, but he loved also the 
strong perfume of lilac blossoms. The complex im- 
pressions of the night, he says, came to him chiefly 
through the sense of smell. "There is a scent to 
everything," he wrote in his diary ; "even the snow, 
if you can detect it no two places, hardly any two 
hours, anywhere, exactly alike." And what is true 
of his sense of smell is substantially true of his other 
sensuous faculties. So highly did he value these that 
he even spoke of the "soul senses," and asserted that 
the spirit receives from the body no less than it gives. 
Significantly, one of the commonest words in his writ- 
ings is "absorbing." He absorbed anything as bulky 
as Kanada, or as impalpable as the dusky green of 
the cedar. Everything in Nature fresh air, swamp 
odors, the song of the wood- thrush was to him so 
much spiritual food. In most of Whitman's great- 
est poems "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard 
Bloom'd," "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking," 
"Crossing Brooklyn Ferry," and isolated passages 
such as that beginning " I am he that walks with the 
tender and growing night," Nature is more promi- 
nent than the democratic propaganda that Whitman 
was impelled so insistently to set forth. The mysti- 
cal revelation of Nature's meanings came to him, it

THE DIAL, 



[June 1, 



should be noted, on a "transparent summer morning" 
when, as he says, he and his soul lay together on 
the ground (a passage which, unfortunately, has not 
found its way into this collection) ; and throughout 
his life Whitman sought to bring everything to the 
test of the open air all books, all observation, all 
philosophy and religion. He spoke his own poems 
to the wind, and bade his readers do likewise. Born 
and bred on - fish-shaped Paumanok," with clover 
and winding lanes and "cow-processions " about him, 
and the moody ocean rolling its waves to the shore 
almost within hearing distance, he learned to love 
Nature, both pastoral and wild. Gentle Nature he 
celebrated especially in his diaries covering the years 
of his convalescence in New Jersey; wild Nature, 
generally the ocean, he celebrated constantly in his 
verse. The little volume embodying the best of this 
writing has been given an attractive setting by its 

publishers. 

Kindred in lightness of mood and man- 
ner an ^ * n an intention to reveal the 
unsuspected charm of every-day liv- 
ing, are two volumes of recently-issued essays, one, 
called "First and Last," containing a fresh supply 
of Mr. Hilaire Belloc's dainty trifling (Dutton); the 
other, "Romance and Reality" (Kennerley), being 
practically Mr. Holbrook Jackson's introduction to 
our reading public. Mr. Jackson is of the school of 
Chesterton and Belloc; in thought he has closer 
affinity with G. K. C., but the graceful rather than 
forceful style of his essays is nearer to Mr. Belloc's 
gentle, genial way of putting things. Mr. Jackson 
opens fire with a distinctively Chestertonic declara- 
tion. 

" I like to do nothing, to sit by a fire in winter, or in 
a garden in summer; to loaf on a sea-beach with the sun on 
me ; to hang over a pier-head and watch the waves in their 
green and white tantrums ; to sit in a brasserie on a Parisian 
boulevard with a common bock, and the people moving to 
and fro; . . . to forget haste and effort in old empty churches, 
or drowsy taverns ; to rest by a roadside hedge, or in a 
churchyard where sheep browse; to sit on a fence these 
things please me well." 

Work, in Mr. Jackson's philosophy, is a necessary 
and almost universal evil ; possibly, too, it adds rel- 
ish to idleness, to the happy margin of real living 
for which it provides the means. Doing nothing 
involves, for Mr. Jackson, besides sitting about in 
pleasant places, "going to Nowhere," along the 
open road with its wayside treasures, or by city 
streets that never yield up the full richness of their 
humanity to the man who is hurrying somewhere. It 
involves, also, an acceptance of the gospel of " Peter- 
pantheism," a realization that, in the capacity for 
pure joy of living, " the most superb adult is a dis- 
mal failure beside a child making mud pies or a 
kitten chasing its tail." And with the spirit of youth, 
of play and make-believe, with the love of "going 
to Nowhere" and seeing much by the way, go a hot 
distaste for the noisy trafficking of our " hucksters' 
age," a deep pity for the hopeless, hunger-tamed 
wrecks of humanity, who, borne down by the struggle, 
have lost their capacity for joy and become almost 



indifferent to pain, and an enthusiastic appreciation 
for the men who are interpreting the age, and fur- 
nishing it with a varied gospel of betterment. Mr. 
Jackson's "Introductions," as he terms his casual 
interpretations of Maeterlinck, Chesterton, Wells, 
Robert Blatchford, and Will Rothenstein, contain 
some of his most sincere and earnest work. Par- 
ticularly good, as is natural considering the kinship 
of their thought, is the Introduction to Mr. Chester- 
ton. Mr. Belloc's idea of amusing himself with 
life is to prick its popular fallacies and to supply odd 
data that will give color to its current commonplaces. 
The commonplaces he fronts squarely ; he has none 
of Mr. Chesterton's art of making them appear sud- 
denly new and strange. His way is to interpret them 
by parable, to tinge them with kindly irony, to look 
at them through the eyes of old men, to invest them 
with the great associations of history. "First and 
Last" contains many entertaining, if not momentous, 
discussions on such varied topics as cheeses, captains 
of industry, St. Patrick, the tide, the Public, and 
the Battle of Hastings. It is just the sort of book 
to explore on a rainy holiday afternoon. Its adven- 
tures are quainter than Mr. Jackson's, less strenuous, 
less youthful. For a sunny, windy, sea-side holiday, 
Mr. Jackson's book will be in better tune. 



for the ^^ atte ntion to the 

traveller revised editions of Grant Allen's ad- 

inltalv. mirable guide-books to Venice, the 

Umbrian Towns, and the Smaller Tuscan Towns, and 
especially to the new volume on the delightful group 
of little Tuscan cities, Arezzo, Pistoia, Lucca, Pisa, 
Siena, and the rest, that are so deservedly dear to 
all lovers of Italy. These volumes (published by 
Messrs. Holt) are attractive and convenient in form, 
clear, orderly, well-written, and constructed on sound 
principles. While they are adapted typographically 
to the use of the hurried traveller, they assume a 
stay of some length in the fascinating towns they 
describe, and they therefore lead the visitor to the 
monuments in chronological sequence, so that, at 
the end of his stay, he may have a really organic 
impression of the city as a whole, of its history and 
its art. They are enriched with well-executed 
reproductions, from photographs, of monuments 
elsewhere for the sake of comparison with those de- 
scribed in the text. The idea is a good one, and 
might be carried further to advantage. But the 
great value of the series, in our judgment, resides 
in the emphasis laid upon what may be called the 
human, as distinguished from the exclusively art is 
tic, interest of the monuments. Mr. Maurice Hew- 
lett somewhere says: "The question whether this 
or that bad picture is by Duccio or Cimabue is noth- 
ing to me. Sufficient is it that somebody painted 
the thing to somebody's order. Now how near does 
it take me to those dead people in whoso country I 
stand?" This point of view is applicable to all pic- 
tures, good as well as bad, and indeed to all artistic 
production ; and it is to the credit of the editors of 
this series that they have adopted it. In the in- 



1912.] 



THE DIAI, 



439 



troduction to the volume on Venice, Mr. Allen 
wrote: "Instead of looking upon monuments . . . 
mainly as the product of this or that architect, I 
look upon them rather as material embodiments of 
the spirit of the age crystallizations, as it were, in 
stone and bronze, in form and colour, of great popu- 
lar enthusiasms." As a consequence, the traveller 
is led to see the human uses to which architecture 
and painting were put in the brave days of old, and 
it is impossible that such associations should not give 
a vitality and permanence to his impressions that 
they could hardly otherwise have. Naturally, this 
admirable principle is not perfectly carried out ; but, 
at least, the traveller who uses these guide-books 
will never be able to think of the churches he has 
seen as mere museums, nor the pictures as utterly 
divorced from the altars over which they once hung. 
The errors that we have noted are neither numerous 
nor important. The account of Assisi is perhaps, to 
a sensitive eye, unduly colored by the preconcep- 
tions of M. Sabatier. At any rate, the interesting 
little chapel in the fields below the city, which M. 
Sabatier, in defiance of tradition, calls "the true 
Rivo Torto," is dedicated not to San Giovanni, but 
to San Rufino d'Arce, a local saint. The Sodoma 
frescoes on either side of the altar in the chapel of 
St. Catherine at San Domenico in Siena are wrongly 
described. The one represents the Stigmatization of 
the Saint at Pisa, the other the occasion when, not 
being able to go to the altar in San Domenico, she was 
communicated by Christ Himself. Considering the 
great influence of Catherine in her own day and her 
permanent hold upon the affections of men, it seems 
hardly justifiable to reduce her biography to the 
statement that she was "the daughter of a dyer, 
born in Siena in 1347." Finally, in the article on 
Montefalco, that little shrine of Umbrian art, there 
is a typical guide-book error, which is not common, 
we think, in this series, but which is worth noting 
for its moral. In the church of San Francesco, there 
is a group of three saints attributed to Lo Spagna, 
and named, on the canvas itself, "S. Vicentius, 
S. Illuminata, S. Nicolaus." These names the article 
accepts without question or comment. But inasmuch 
as the female saint is crowned and bears the palm 
and wheel, it requires no great knowledge of hagi- 
ology to identify her, in spite of the inscription, as 
St. Catherine of Alexandria. Moreover, the name 
Nicholas, without qualification, is misleading; for in 
Umbria it generally means Nicholas of Bari, while 
the saint so named in this picture is plainly Nicholas 
of Tolentino, who flourished a thousand years later 
than the benevolent bishop. But these are trifles. 
The books are invaluable to all intelligent travellers 
in Italy. _ 



A hand-book 
of American 

forestry. 



^ est book on American Forests, 
their use and conservation, that has 

yet been written ig Mr Si mon B. 

Elliott's " The Important Timber-Trees of the United 
States," just published by the Houghton Mifflin Co. 
There are larger tree-books, sumptuous and expen- 



sive volumes dealing with our trees in scientific man- 
ner and telling us all about their relationships and 
their kinds; but there is no other that gives us in 
clear and concise form the wisdom of the trees, the 
science of the forest. The author is a trained for- 
ester ; he has been for many years a member of the 
Pennsylvania Forestry Commission, and so knows 
whereof he speaks. While we are all prone to ad- 
mire the forests, to grow eloquent in their praise, 
here is one man at least who with his associates is 
actually doing something to make these gifts of na- 
ture permanent, teaching men to use and not to de- 
stroy, to cover the mountains with the mantle of 
protection and not leave them to be ruined by the 
merciless erosion of the elements. Mr. Elliott's 
handbook is so well arranged, so beautifully illus- 
trated, and so simple in style, that it can be enjoyed 
and used by everybody. The forest-owner will want 
it, to aid him in the care of his estate; the lumber- 
man must have it and follow its counsels, or his in- 
dustry will perish ; the farmer will read it and learn 
to save his hillsides from erosion and his meadows 
from destruction. In short, this is a book on real 
conservation ; but it is a book on restoration as well. 
It tells us not only how to use the land that is ours, 
but how to retrieve the follies of yesterday, how 
to rebuild the waste places, how to save our soil- 
wealth from ultimate destruction. The first of the 
two parts into which the volume is divided is for 
the land-owner, who may learn here to plant the 
seeds of the grove, how to care for seedlings, how 
to transplant. The second part describes every valu- 
able forest tree of the country, and enumerates its 
qualities and its possibility of service in human in- 
dustry. The book as a whole is as timely as it is 
valuable. Its precepts must be heeded, and heeded 
now, if this nation would avoid the irretrievable 
disaster that has befallen Palestine and Spain. 

Amateurs as well as those more ad- 
vanced in the study of butterflies 
will rejoice over the very intelligible 
"Butterfly and Moth Book" by Mrs. Ellen Robertson- 
Miller. The book begins with the statement that 
"the history of a moth or butterfly is a veritable 
fairy-tale, and of absorbing interest when we study 
the development of the insect through the four 
periods of its existence." The story of over thirty 
moths or butterflies is traced through the egg, cater- 
pillar, pupa, and winged stage, and made clear not 
only by the text, but by a wonderful series of pho- 
tographs. Even the ignoramus to whom all cater- 
pillars are only ugly crawling things cannot repress 
a dip into the book here and there to find out how 
the beautiful Modesta comes from her ugly "worm 
of promise," or the Viceroy from a caterpillar all 
humps and bumps. And ten to one after a dip or 
two he is in for the whole book, and comes out an 
ignoramus no longer, which is to say that the 
book accomplishes the rare alliance of scientific accu- 
racy and fulness with popular interest. The answer 
to the common query, " How can I tell a moth from

a butterfly?" is thus clearly stated : " Usually by the 
feelers or antennae located on the head those of a 
butterfly being always thread-like and clubbed at the 
end, while those of moths vary according to species 
and are of several different patterns. Another dif- 
ference is that the majority of moths fly at night and 
the butterflies in the daytime; and, again, the moths 
rest with wings held horizontally, in roof form, or 
wrapped about the body, while butterflies when at 
rest usually hold their wings in a vertical position." 
Nearly all of the very numerous illustrations are 
beautiful to look at, and all have the merit of 
showing just the points most needed for perfect expo- 
sition. (Seribner.) 

An up-to-date guide-book, that should 
prove useful to the traveller, is Mr. 
Douglas Sladen's " How to See Italy " 
(Pott). In its nearly 600 pages, illustrated by 
160 reproductions from photographs, with its large 
map, detailed descriptions of routes by rail, steamer, 
motor, or carriage, nearly all practical matters con- 
nected with Italian travel are well considered. As 
a guide-book to town and country, to scenery and 
places, it seems entirely trustworthy. It is quite 
otherwise than trustworthy, however, when it deals 
with pictures, sculpture, and antiquities in general. 
Here, the author speaks with an air at once so defi- 
nite and so debonair as to amaze a cautious student 
For example, he twice speaks of the statue of a draped 
female figure found at Antium more than thirty years 
ago as "recently discovered," and adds that "it rep- 
resents a school-girl." As a matter of fact, no statue 
more shrouded in mystery has ever perplexed the 
student; and because archaeologists are to-day as 
ignorant of its authorship, name, and place in the 
history of Greek art as they were thirty years ago, 
the figure is still often called " The Maiden of Mys- 
tery." But, whatever it may or may not be, it is pretty 
certain that the statue does not represent a school-girl. 
Other similar slips may be noted; but usually they 
are amusing rather than serious blemishes. 

The enthusiastic student of birds 

SStSSS *** hel P applying what Mr. 
Augustus Wright Bomberger says in 
the Introduction to his " Book of Birds" (Winston) : 
"There is perhaps less danger of becoming a mere 
one-sided specialist along this line in the natural 
world around us than any other. It is hard to be nar- 
row and contracted of spirit amidst the sweet and 
multitudinous voices of the winged creatures of the 
air." The author calls himself a beginner in bird- 
lore, and writes in the hope of helping beginners; 
but it would be difficult to imagine any old profes- 
sor of "birdology" who would not take pleasure in 
this book, it is so genuine, and so full of the love of 
anything that wears feathers and sings. Bewitch- 
ing photographs of nests, and of youthful kingfishers, 
crows, catbirds, warblers, and especially red- eyed 
vireos, who are still in bed or " who ought to be in 
bed," delight the eye. Verses by the author punc- 



tuate the chapters and gratify the ear. A good key 
is appended, though the book i- meant "to arouse 
and inspire rather than instruct." An interesting 
fact which further coimnemls it is that the site of 
Mr. Bomberger's study is Western Pennsylvania, 
near where Audubon lived. All the birds of tliis 
region are met in their haunts; and their habits, 
with many of their sayings, are lovingly reported. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The late Dr. W. J. Rolfe's "Satchel Guide t<> Ku- 
rope," which for forty years has proved an almost indis- 
pensable adjunct to the paraphernalia of the vacation 
tourist abroad, makes its annual reappearance in a re- 
vised edition for 1912. The revisions seem to have been 
extensive this year, as the type is entirely reset and the 
volume printed from new plates throughout Messrs. 
Houghton Miftlin Co. are the publishers. 

Another batch of " Home University Library " vol- 
umes (Holt) further emphasizes the usefulness of this 
publishing enterprise, and the competency of the writers 
whom it enlists. One could not well ask for something 
better than such handy volumes as Dr. A. F. Pollard's 
" History of England," and Mr. A. G. Bradley's " Ca- 
nada," and Mr. W. Warde Fowler's " Rome," and Mr. 
G. L. Strachey's " Landmarks in French Literature." 
These are readable books as well as trustworthy ones. 

Although emanating, according to the date-line of the 
Preface, from the " Department of History, University 
of Washington," Miss Katherine Berry Judson's "Myths 
and Legends of California and the Old Southwest" 
(McClurg) is a popular rather than a scholarly work. 
The volume contains some seventy brief Indian myths; 
and is illustrated by many half-tones of Western scenery, 
and a few more pertinent plates. The tales are interest- 
ing; but they arouse the suspicion that, like many recent 
attempts to reproduce folklore, they have gained sophis- 
tication and literary effectiveness at the cost of their true 
primitive flavor. 

Miss May Sinclair, the novelist, has published through 
the Women Writers' Suffrage League of London a pam- 
phlet entitled " Feminism," in which she disposes very 
conclusively of the pseudo-scientific argument recently 
advanced by Sir Almroth Wright to the effect that hys- 
teria and neurosis are the pathogenic agents responsible 
for the modern suffrage movement The booklet de- 
serves wide circulation. Suffragists will find in its pages 
many effective barbs for their argumentative shafts; but 
especially is it to be recommended to those honestly in 
doubt as to the character and purpose of the present- 
day feminist movement. 

"Harper's Guide to Wild Flowers" is a good-si /<! 
manual, prepared by Mrs. Caroline A. Creevy, which 
classifies flowers by a new system presumably easier than 
the old. "This classification is the one present, il in the 
seventh edition of ' Gray's Manual of Botany,' published 
in 1908, and embodies the decisions of the Vienna Con- 
gress of 1905" so reads the publisher's notire of tin- 
book. It is a complete guide to the flowers of the Atlantic 
and Middle States, and to some extent of the South' m 
States. Numerous full-page plates, including several in 
color, illustrate the volume. Though too bulky for a 
hand-bag, it may easily be stowed in the suit-case of an 
enthusiastic botanist in his summer travels.

All lovers of English gardens, groves, and fields will 
rejoice in the new and enlarged edition of Mr. C. A. 
Johns's " Forest Trees of Britain," now entitled " British 
Trees and Shrubs" (Button). The new edition surpasses 
the old, not in the text (that remains unsurpassed), but 
in the lengthened list of species, in the descriptions of 
the finer small trees and shrubs suitable for lawn and 
garden, and above all in the increased number of beau- 
tiful full-page plates, many of them colored, and all 
extremely helpful. Mr. Johns's pages are by no means 
confined to detailed descriptions of species, or to the 
rules of horticulture; his chapters are replete with lore 
and legend and all manner of interesting tradition and 
literary reference. The new volume is edited by Mr. 
E. T. Cook, whose part consists in the main of brief 
descriptions and commendations of such desirable shrubs 
as have more recently come upon the market. 

" The Yosemite National Park is perhaps the most 
delightful region in all the world for the study of plant 
life." So declare Mr. and Mrs. Harvey Monroe Hall 
in the introduction to their " Yosemite Flora " (Paul 
Elder & Co.). The book forms a popular guide to the 
interesting vegetation found among the Yosemite foot- 
hills and extending up its mountain-summits as far as 
the line of perpetual snow. The nine hundred and 
fifty-five species here described represent, in large part, 
the results of the author's own botanical explorations 
throughout the Park. All the plants have been care- 
fully classified and grouped according to their relation- 
ships, and keys are provided for the determination of 
their names. Technical terms have been introduced 
only where accuracy demands their use. The intro- 
duction deals with the origin, characteristics, and distri- 
bution of the flora in general, and the descriptive matter 
devoted to the individual species supplies information 
relative to the locality in which they may be found, 
their use by the Indians, their medicinal and poisonous 
properties, and interesting points regarding their dis- 
covery. There are eleven full-page illustrations from 
photographs, and numerous outline cuts in the text aid 
in easy identification of the different varieties. 

A revelation of the beauty and variety of an art that 
has by no means yet reached its rightful place in popu- 
lar appreciation is embodied in the " Catalogue of the 
International Exhibition of Contemporary Medals " held 
by the American Numismatic Society in 1910. This is 
a revised edition, much amplified and fully illustrated, 
of the provisional catalogue issued for the use of visitors 
to the exhibition. Biographical sketches (supplied in 
many cases by the artists themselves) of nearly all of the 
two hundred-odd exhibitors are given, with full descrip- 
tion of each of the medals exhibited. A clearly- written 
Introduction, by Miss Agnes Baldwin, traces the history 
of the medallic art, and describes the various processes 
employed in the production of modern medals. The 
most notable feature of the volume, however, and one 
which in itself entitles the work to a place in every art 
library, is its wealth of illustrations. These consist of 
nearly five hundred separate half-tone cuts, beautifully 
reproduced and printed, illustrating several thousand 
medals. In every detail the book reflects much credit 
upon all concerned in its production not least the 
De Vinne Press, who have given it an outward garb of 
dignified typography and perfect presswork deserving 
of the highest praise. It is a work that will do much 
to enhance a more general interest in, and appreciation 
of, the fascinating art of the medallist. 



NOTES. 



Dr. Lawrence P. Jacks, editor of " The Hibbert Jour- 
nal," and author of "Mad Shepherds," "Among the 
Idol Makers," etc., is soon to visit the United States. 

Mr. Henry S. Harrison, author of " Queed," has well 
on the way toward completion a new novel which Hough- 
ton Mifflin Co. expect to publish either in the coming 
autumn or early next year. 

Dr. Henry Sweet, for the past eleven years university 
reader in phonetics at Oxford, and author of a long list 
of standard works in the field of philology and phonetics, 
is dead at the age of sixty-eight. 

Mrs. John King Van Rensselaer, author of " The 
Devil's Picture Books," will soon publish through Messrs. 
Jacobs another study in the same field entitled " Pro- 
phetical, Educational, and Playing Cards." 

A volume of verse by Mr. La Tpuche Hancock, con- 
sisting principally of contributions to the columns of the 
New York " Sun " during the past ten years, will be 
issued shortly by the Neale Publishing Co. 

A volume on Robert Toombs, by Professor Ulrich B. 
Phillips, and one on Ulysses S. Grant, by Dr. Franklin S. 
Edmonds, are announced as immediately forthcoming in 
Messrs. Jacobs's " American Crisis Biographies." 

Mr. Algot Lange, author of " In the Amazon Jungle," 
recently published by Messrs. Putnam, has been chosen 
to head the South American expedition now being organ- 
ized by the Museum of Pennsylvania University. 

Mr. C. E. Brock, an English illustrator of unusual 
skill and intelligence, has been commissioned to prepare 
the drawings for an illustrated holiday edition of Mr. 
Jeffery FarnoPs popular novel, " The Broad Highway." 

A new novel by M. Rene' Bazin entitled " Davide'e 
Birot " will be issued shortly by Messrs. Charles Scrib- 
ner's Sons. Social problems of the day, particularly the 
problems of labor, hold a prominent place in the story. 

" The Promise of the Christ Age in Recent Litera- 
ture," a study of ten representative works whose inspira- 
tion and interest centre about the Christ figure, will be 
published immediately by Messrs. Putnam. The author 
is Dr. William Eugene Mosher. 

The publication of Professor Earl Barnes's study of 
" Woman in Modern Society " has been postponed so as 
to permit "The Atlantic Monthly" to use three chapters 
in its three immediately forthcoming issues. The book 
will be published in August by Mr. B. W. Huebsch. 

Mr. Edwin Bjorkman, whose translations of three of 
Strindberg's plays were recently published by Scribners, 
will bring out this summer, through the same house, an 
English rendering of Strindberg's " There are Crimes and 
Crimes," a drama dealing with modern life in Paris. 

Mr. Edward Thomas is at work on a critical study of 
Swinburne, which will be published later in the year. 
Mr. Thomas's book will in no way clash with the official 
biography of Swinburne, on which Mr. Watts-Dunton is 
engaged, and which, we understand, is making satisfac- 
tory progress. 

M. Anatole France's forthcoming novel, " Une Idylle 
sous la Revolution," is said to owe its existence to a 
chance discovery by M. France of some engravings by 
Prudhon, intended for an edition of Racine, but rejected 
by Didot, the publisher. The pictures roused M. France 
to an enthusiasm for Prudhon, and, as was the case with 
the Goncourts and others, study of Prudhon expanded 
into study of the Directoire period, then of the Terror,

late this month. 

" Radical Empiricism," by the late William James, 
will be published immediately by Messrs. Longmans. 
According to the publishers' announcement, the author 
gives utterance in this volume "to a doctrine which he 
regarded as of more fundamental importance than his 
widely-known pragmatism."

to flutter the Bergsonian dove-cotes. The author is Dr. 
Hugh S. R. Elliot, who may be remembered as the editor 
of John Stuart Mill's published letters, and the publishers 
are Messrs. Longmans, Green & Co. 

Mr. John Muir's interesting tribute to the late Ed- 
ward H. Harriman has been issued by Messrs. Double- 
day, Page & Co. in an attractive booklet for private 
circulation. We understand that a copy will be sent 
free to any librarian who makes application to the pub- 
lishers. It is well deserving of a place in every library. 

Mr. Bryce's forthcoming book on South America, to 
be published by Messrs. Macmillan, will not, as was at 
first thought, treat mainly of constitutional and admin- 
istrative questions. Unlike " The American Common- 
wealth," it will give a general picture of the South Amer- 
ican countries, and of their commercial development. 

It is announced that the right to publish the author- 
ized editions of the writings of Walt Whitman has been 
transferred to Mr. Mitchell Kennerley by the Whitman 
executors, Messrs. Thomas B. Harned and Horace Trau- 
bel. Mr. Kennerley announces new editions of "Leaves 
of Grass " and "Complete Prose Works." Mr. Horace 
Traabel's " Walt Whitman in Camden " has also been 
transferred to the same publisher, and a third volume 
is to be issued in the autumn. 

The late Henry Haynie, who died at his home in 
Newton Centre, Mass., May 15, was born at Winchester, 
Illinois, in 1841, received a grammar-school and high- 
school education, and promptly responded to the call 
to arms when the Civil War broke out, enlisting in the 
first infantry company raised in Chicago. After honor- 
ably serving in the Army of the Cumberland and under- 
going several months' confinement in Libby Prison, he 
was mustered out in 1864, and entered upon newspaper 
work. His foreign editorship of the New York " Times " 
and his subsequent Paris correspondence to a number 
of American journals are among his best-known activities 
in this department of literary labor, and incidentally 
they opened the way for his two best books, " Paris, 
Past and Present," a descriptive and historical work, 
and " The Captains and the Kings," a reminiscent vol- 
ume from one who, in the pursuit of his calling, had 
met and talked with a considerable number of promi- 
nent men. 

AUGUST STRINDBKRG. 

The perturbed spirit of August Strindberg passed to 
its rest on the fourteenth of last month, after racking 
its frail tenement of clay for sixty-three years, and with 
its passing the greatest figure in the Swedish literature 
of our time disappeared from the view of men. Strind- 



berg illustrated, better than most of the examples ad- 
duced in ita support, the familiar notion of the close 
relationship of genius to insanity. Lombroso, we suppose, 
would have called him insane, and made no bones about 
it, but such a verdict would account but inadequately for 
his extraordinary power to cause vibrations in the con- 
sciousness of his readers. For the most part, the mo- 
tions (or emotions) thus set up in minds that came 
within the sphere of his influence were not pleasurable 
ones, and were accompanied by a distinct sense of aver- 
sion, and even of repulsion. What most men held 
acred in belief and human relationship had for him no 
sanctity, and he rode rough-shod, with a Nietzschean 
brutality, over their tenderest sentiments and their most 
cherished social beliefs. The intensity of his intellectual 
life brought him at times close to the borderland between 
reason and unreason, and the reader of his many books, 
who does not correlate them as he reads with the state 
of mind and other conditions under which they were 
written, will find them hard to interpret in the terms of 
any well-ordered system of thinking about art and social 
philosophy. His warmest admirers must allow that his 
literary output, taken in its entirety, exhibits an unbal- 
anced mind, and a mind permanently twisted awry by 
circumstance. His work was the expression of an un- 
happy life, desperately eager for happiness, and essaying 
many futile ventures in its quest. He was a confused 
idealist, without the central core of glowing faith that 
irradiates the writings of Bjornson and Ibsen, and makes 
those men in so high a sense prophets of humanity. Of 
life as it was revealed to him in the shifting moods 
through which he surveyed it, he had an extraordinarily 
intense and penetrating vision, and he had an almost un- 
exampled mastery over the rich and flexible language 
to whose inheritance he was born. His collected works, 
filling upwards of fifty volumes, contain nearly all the 
species of literary composition, although novels and 
plays are predominant. He was a hater of womankind, 
and was preoccupied to the point of obsession with the 
share of sex-struggle in human life. His realism was 
unrestrained, as to both word and situation, and no Kn- 
glish publisher would dare to reproduce some of his 
works in uuexpurgated translation. He is only begin- 
ning to be known at all to the English-reading public, 
but his death will probably stimulate the activity of trans- 
lators and theatre-managers, with the effect of consid- 
erably enlarging our acquaintance with his works.

deeds of daring for love's sweet sake as well as of lif.-'s

The Convictions 
of a Grandfather 

By ROBERT GRANT 

As everybody knows who has read his 
" Opinions of a Philosopher," and his 
"Reflections of a Married Man," the 
writer is a shrewd and genial philoso- 
pher ; he views contemporary life with 
a keen if indulgent eye. Not a question 
of the day, big or little, confronting an 
American family of comfortable cir- 
cumstances, but he touches here, with 
his sympathy and humor.

UNIVERSITY CONTROL. 

" That a professor's salary should depend on the favor 
of a president, or that he should be dismissed without a 
hearing by a president with the consent of an absentee 
board of trustees is a state of affairs not conceivable in 
an English or German university." 

This succinct statement illustrates a condition of 
affairs which has become common in our Amer- 
ican institutions of higher education, many of 
which have fully developed, or tend to develop, 
a system of academic autocracy which, in the 
opinion of many observers, is ominous of evil 
and a menace to the best interests of education. 
Things were not always thus, for a historical 
survey of the history of universities shows a 
very different condition to have prevailed in 
earlier times. The great mediaeval universities, 
to which legend tells us that students flocked by 
the tens of thousands, were organized upon a 
basis which made them true republics of learning. 
A university then was " unhierarchical, democ- 
ratic, anarchic," being simply the professors and 
the students, governed by many prescriptions of 
custom, and administered by councils and rec- 
tors elected for short periods by the university 
body. The German universities of the nineteenth 
century inherited this good tradition, and the 
English universities followed its teachings. In 
America, the colonial colleges copied the English 
form of government, and were controlled by their 
faculties, fellows, and alumni. By gradual steps, 
however, they slipped into the hands of small self- 
perpetuating corporations, of which an extreme 
case was Columbia, whose reactionary charter of 
1810 gave to trustees and president autocratic 
powers of the sort that political absolutism was 
even then beginning to discard as outworn and 
unconsonant with the new spirit of freedom that 
was abroad in the world. 

These quotations and examples are taken 
from Professor Cattell's informed and thorough 
discussion of the subject of university control 
("Science," Nos. 908-909), a subject upon 
which he has had much to say of late, finding 
occasion for caustic criticism of existing Ameri- 
can conditions, and standing as the champion of 
an academic democracy and a teaching profession 
upon which a man may enter without forfeiting 
his self-respect. An earlier paper on the same 
subject, published some six years ago, was 
reprinted by him, with footnotes, and sent to

several hundred men of science holding academic 
positions, asking for their opinions. About three 
hundred replies were received, exhibiting a some- 
what remarkable consensus of agreement upon 
the main thesis, and betraying a degree of dis- 
satisfaction with present conditions, which those 
in the seats of educational power would be well- 
advised to heed. This paper proposed a plan of 
organization upon more democratic lines than now 
prevail, not as a substitution to be immediately 
made, but rather as an ideal to which recon- 
structive movements should tend. A university 
corporation was proposed which should be made 
of professors, alumni, and interested members 
of the community at large. This corporation 
should elect trustees " having the ordinary func- 
tions of trustees the care of the property and 
the representation of the common sense of the 
corporation and of the community in university 
policy." The professors should elect a president 
for a short term of years (or an annual rector, 
as in Germany), and "his salary should not be 
larger, his position more dignified or his powers 
greater than those of the professor." The uni- 
versity should be organized in departments, each 
of which should elect its own administrative head, 
"and have as complete autonomy as is consistent 
with the welfare of the university as a whole," 
and each department should nominate its own 
professors. There should be a coordinating body, 
or "senate" for final elections and for general 
legislation. " There should be as much flexibility 
and as complete anarchy throughout the univer- 
sity as is consistent with unity and order." 

These are the outlines of the plan offered for 
consideration to Professor Cattail's correspond- 
ents. He does not balk at the word "anarchy," 
nor will his intelligent readers, for they know 
that the term has a respectable connotation, and 
its use in this connection properly emphasizes 
the contrast that should be drawn between the 
ideal advocated and the ideal which naturally 
finds favor in a commercial and industrial com- 
munity, which owes its prosperity to autocratic 
forms of organization, and to which " efficiency " 
is a fetich. It is hard indeed to make such a com- 
munity realize that its most cherished maxims 
and methods cannot be applied to an art least 
of all to the fine art of education and that in 
such application they must be deadening or de- 
structive. Yet such is undoubtedly the case, 
and it illustrates just the difference or the 
absolute antagonism between the professional 
and the commercial motive. The professional 
man must be free to set his own standards of 
conduct ; the man of business pursuits must be 



content with having them set for him by the 
State, or by the organized opinion of his special 
occupation. Freedom is the breath of life to the 
professions, and the law of fruition in achieve- 
ment is for them the law which the inner being 
of the individual both shapes and enforces upon 
him. " Efficiency " properly lauded in the erec- 
tion of a building, the construction of a machine, 
or the management of a railway system, is a per- 
fectly meaningless bugbear in the realm of medi- 
cine, or of art, or of teaching, and it is enough 
to make angels weep to read certain recent sug- 
gestions that the methods which yield desirable 
practical results iu bricklaying should forthwith 
be applied to the work done in our schools and 
colleges. The state of mind in which such a 
suggestion can be even entertained is one that 
calls for a curious inspection of the bumps. 
The university is the last place where efficiency 
should prevail, says Professor Cattell, if it means 
giving autocratic powers to any individual. We 
like a writer who is not too timid to take a logical 
bull by the horns. 

The answers received in reply to the question, 
299 in number, showed 46 favorable to the pres- 
ent system, 69 favorable to a greater degree of 
faculty control, and 184 favorable to "a plan of 
representative democracy more or less similar to 
the one proposed." These figures certainly justify 
the statement that " when eighty-five per cent 
of those responsible for the conduct of a given 
system unite in holding that it should be altered, 
the case may be regarded as strong." A still 
stronger statement results from examining the 
returns made by five large institutions Col- 
umbia, Pennsylvania, Cornell, Johns Hopkins, 
and Chicago for out of seventy-two replies 
only three indicated a preference for the exist- 
ing system. " This is surely a condition which 
foretells reform or bankruptcy" is Professor 
Cattell's fitting comment. The realization of 
such a reform as is urged in this paper must 
necessarily be a matter of many years. As Pro- 
fessor Cattell says, " no sensible person would 
attempt to reform suddenly by a paper constitu- 
tion a system which has developed in response to 
its environment. The boss in politics, the trust 
magnate in business, the university president 
and school superintendent, have probably con- 
duced to a certain kind of efficiency and to an 
enlargement more rapid than would othei -\\i-r 
have been possible." But this does not mean that 
the system thus shaped should be perpetuated, 
and we are convinced that our author is right, as 
far as the root of the matter is concerned. But 
it will be peculiarly difficult to give effect to such

a reform as he proposes, for the reason that the 
controlling authorities in most of our universities 
are bodies of men successful in affairs, who can- 
not think that the methods by which efficiency 
is secured and success attained in the business 
world may not properly be applicable in the edu- 
cational sphere, and to whom the professional 
point of view is simply incomprehensible. They 
will not easily be converted, because they cannot 
easily be made to understand. Yet the ideal is 
worth understanding which is embodied in this 
series of questions : 

" Can there not be one university where the professor 
will have a study instead of an office, where the ideal 
set before the young instructor is something else than 
answering letters promptly and neatly on the typewriter, 
where men are weighed rather than counted, where 
efficiency and machinery are subordinated to the per- 
sonality of great men? Could there not be a university 
or school, dominating some field of scholarship and 
research with its half-dozen professors and group of 
instructors and students drawn together by them? 
Might not means be devised by which the professor 
would be paid for the value of his teaching service and 
research, and then be set free to do his work how and 
when and where he can do it best." 

It is our belief that such a university is pos- 
sible, and that, when once brought into being, 
it would do away with many evils, while its 
efficiency in the higher sense would be made so 
manifest that many others would hasten to copy 
its example. 



THE DUOCENTENARY OF ROUSSEAU. 



The case of Rousseau is about to be re-opened. 
The occasion for even Jean- Jacques must await 
his turn in the modern magazine is provided by 
the approaching duocentenary. Therefore, as the 
twenty-eighth of June draws nigh, we may expect 
to hear that Rousseau was good, that Rousseau was 
bad, that he was a great prophet, that he was a mad- 
man, as well as other opinions almost as diverse and 
contradictory. And we shall not easily come to a 
conclusion, since the whole question involves the 
fundamental opposition between the feelings and the 
intellect. For if the personality of Jean-Jacques is 
still a matter of discussion, if the value of his influ- 
ence is contested, it is because he represents, in his 
temperament no less than in his conception of life, 
education, and politics, the man of feeling the 
neurasthenic, one might almost say as opposed to 
the humanist and believer in the supremacy of the 
reason. 

Such a platitude perhaps requires an apology. 
Yet from this fact arises the whole dispute over 
Rousseau. Judged by the Romantic generation, 
his lineal descendants, Jean-Jacques is accounted a 
saint. Dissected by modern pathological criticism, 
he is explained as a degenerate. That fact at least 



indicates a reaction. Among his contemporaries, 
however, we find something of each point of view. 
This shows us that Rousseau's nature must have had 
its winsome side. Indeed, the whole theory of his 
repulsive personality, so ingeniously forwarded by 
Grimm, Diderot, and their circle, is refuted at once 
by Jean-Jacques's proved capacity to attract friends 
and to win their affection and their influence. In 
this respect, at least, there was really no need for 
Mrs. Macdonald to amass all the laborious evidence 
of her two-volume apologia.* 

Of course, one may make friends everywhere and 
still be a charming good-for-nothing. Such individ- 
uals we all know ; we are not blinded, as were so many 
of Jean-Jacques's contemporaries, by the charms 
of a newly-discovered sentimentality. Keeping one's 
friends is rather a different matter. For friend- 
ship has its duties no less than its privileges ; and if 
this great sentimentalist experienced at times the 
need of affection and appreciation, if he felt now 
and again the want of an interlocutor or a confidant, 
a study of his 4i Confessions " reveals his selfishness 
if not his self-sufficiency. He could forget he 
could let his friends slip out of his life as easily as 
he could change his religion. 

A study of Rousseau's friendships would shed 
much light upon his character. But his essentially 
anti-social egotism needs no such evidence. A genius 
standing out against society, isolated as much through 
his morbid sensitiveness as by an apprenticeship to 
life which deprived him of any realization of man's 
place in a world of men, we may be sure that his 
prodigious capacity for feeling will some day find an 
outlet in the wildest individualism. Motherless and 
early abandoned by a worthless father, we shall not 
expect such a boy to develop any conception of dis- 
cipline. Heredity, environment, and the "moment," 
as Taine puts it, all conspired to produce a Jean- 
Jacques. Yet such is the weakness of his will that 
even these things might have conspired in vain. If 
this young ne'er-do-well, rich only in thirty years of 
vagabondage and dreaming, had not been forced out 
of a home and a disgraceful guest-friendship by a 
qualm of wounded pride (read the whole story from 
the time of the partnership with Anet), he might 
have died a teacher of music in Geneva, and the 
world might never have known what an apostle it 
had lost. 

Upon such a chance did the fame of Rousseau 
depend. Always a plaything of his feelings, a man 
whose actions were determined by his moods, his role 
in history hangs upon the event which sent him forth 
into the world of Paris, a world of convention with 
a highly organized social hierarchy. Into such a 
society, as Emile Faguet points out, a society of 
perfectly dovetailed parts, a world where *' orig- 
inal" spelt "eccentric," came this dreaming vag- 
abond, a grown man with all a boy's timidity, a 
plebeian conscious of genius, an over-sensitive coun-

tryinan, devoid of social graces and social tact The 
result was inevitable. Given such a genius, his de- 
velopment, his theories, his works, his whole apostle- 
ship, arise from his reaction upon society, a reaction 
which came too late to permit him to conform. 

The process of transformation required several 
years. At the beginning, Jean-Jacques made his 
effort to conform : he was obliged to earn his living. 
But deep in his heart, his disappointment and his 
rebellion were slowly gathering force; and when, one 
fine day in 1749, a newspaper announcement of a lit- 
erary contest* suggested an impeachment of civili- 
zation, his sense of personal wrongs and his imag- 
inative sentimentality drove him into self-expression 
with a storm of tears. Now at last he may express 
his opinion of this world of Paris, so different from 
the idealized reminiscences of his vagrant adoles- 
cence. 

That the occasion of this indictment is the arts, 
that he is himself a writer of little comedies and 
light operas, and will continue to be one for years, 
is at least significant. But human motives are often 
mixed, and in the man of moods they may become 
inextricably tangled. So Rousseau wrote his essay, 
won the prize, and, in the first flush of fame which 
the event brought him, threw aside all attempt to 
conform. More than that, he undertook a personal 
reformation: he became, as he tells us, "virtuous or 
at least intoxicated with virtue," resigned his secre- 
taryship to earn his living by copying music, and 
emphasized a republican simplicity of dress by a 
cynic's rudeness of manner. One remembers his early 
reading and his life-long admiration of Plutarch. 

The effect speedily justified the means. Jean- 
Jacques became famous. "All Paris," as he tells us 
in the "Confessions," repeated his biting sarcasms; 
now at last the despised plebeian and the haughty 
aristocrat might exchange rules. Such a transposi- 
tion could hardly have been unpleasant. And if, 
meanwhile, our moral "convert" was living with a 
mistress and sending his illegitimate children one 
after the other to the foundlings' home., it only 
shows us how impossible it is to achieve a senti- 
mental consistency or to escape the influence of one's 
age. One may dream of an Arcadian "Nature " and 
still accept the vices of irresponsibility so conven- 
iently afforded by a hated civilization. 

This was Jean-Jacques's "Conversion." It makes 
a very lyrical page in the "Confessions," a page 
worthy of this re-discovery of emotion in the realm 
of morality. Rousseau was now thirty-seven, his first 
adolescent response to sentiment dulled by use and 
by his experience in Paris. He was to find that 
again, reminiscentially at least, when he quitted the 
world of men and actualities for the dream life of 
the Hermitage. Now, with the first delights of his 
liaison behind him, his heart was drifting like a ship 
becalmed. He had his chance, a chance favored 
by his work with the Encyclopaedists, to divorce his 
brain and his heart. Then, without warning, a new

storm of sentiment overcame him; the .-tilled waters 
began to course once mure ; the tide of passion bore 
away its victim, and Jean- Jacques lost his opportu- 
nity to leai n tlu- true nature of sophistry. 

For if half of his eloquence is vision, a deal of 
it is sophistical. What a corpus vile for clasps in 
logic could be found in Rousseau, if anyone took tin* 
trouble to read these tiresome volumes ! Yet in 
their own day everybody read them ; in an age of 
theorizing, in an age of sentiment already ripe for 
passion, this new strain of passionate theory rang 
on the ears of a feminized society with a delicious 
thrill. And the virtuous Jean-Jacques, no longer 
an outcast, but accepted with all his boorish whims, 
now lived as the guest of the great, and in the inter- 
vals of music-copying poured forth, with a rapidity 
which attests the force of his passion, tin- 1 >i-courn 
sur I'lne'galiteY' the "Lettre sur les Spectacles," 
"Julie," "Emile," the "Contrat Social," and the 
"Lettres de la Montagne." For the fervor of this 
second youth lasted fully twelve years. 

A veritable emotional renascence, out of it sprang 
all the works of Rousseau. After all, passion alone can 
arouse the dreamer to thought, an<l in this prophet 
of an emotional emancipation there were several 
varieties of passion. Jules Lemaitre enumerates 
them in his biography. There was, first of all, the 
plebeian, smarting under the consciousness of hi> 
social unreadiness and his lack of savoir-faln. 
There was the disappointed aspirant for musical 
and literary celebrity. There was the vagabond 
who had suffered, who had endured even hunger 
and privation, in his attempt to live his dream in a 
world of facts. There was, in short, every seed 
of revolt, everything that could help to create a 
destructive critic of the world as it was. But there 
was also the man of generous enthusiasms, filled 
with a personal ideal in which he would have liked 
to include all humanity. All these were combined 
and incarnated in this prose-poet, who, as he tells us,, 
"felt before thinking," and who in reality was only 
impelled to think because he felt. 

Thought derived from such a source is rarely new, 
however original it may appear to its re-discoverer. 
Even in the eighteenth century, Rousseau's ideas 
were not new. The basic principles of his "system " 
were the common property of his age. They were 
in the air, and Jean-Jacques only appropriated them. 
But he made them his by his lyricism, by the com- 
pelling eloquence with which he expressed them, l>y 
his passionate force. And if that eloquence sprang 
from chance, if all his work is the product of cir- 
cumstance, it surely vitiates them as we behold their 
source. It must alter our opinion of their author; a 
man who is guided by events, who is always accus- 
ing circumstances or excusing himself thereby, 
has little of that force of character which we look 
for in our moral leaders. As a moralist, it is our 
right to judge Jean-Jacques and his doc-trine ihu.-; 
as the first of the Romantic fatalists, it is our ri^lit 
to confront his ideas with hi> conle-ioiis ; for if this

dignify his weakness by the name of pragmatism, he 
does excuse it by the sophistries of his "philosophy." 

Of course he is not aware of that. A true Roman- 
ticist, he deceives himself before he deceives others. 
But what unwitting humor in the result! How 
clearly he dissimulates his weakness, how he hides 
his hatred of the facts of life and his desire for an im- 
possible dream of self-indulgence a dream to which 
we owe that virile phrase of our Declaration: "the 
pursuit of happiness"! For when Jean- Jacques 
compares society with the "natural" man, when he 
opposes the evils of society to the good of which he 
is ever conscious in himself, we ought to read, not 
" society," but the rights of others and the ineluctable 
force of reality. No, this regenerator of humanity 
never accepted the fact of life, never saw life sanely 
or saw it whole. 

But space forbids the discussion of Rousseau's 
ideas and their place in the history of civilization. 
To these ideas we owe a great deal: much that is 
good and much that is unqualifiedly bad. After a 
hundred and fifty years, the danger of his doctrine 
is visible in its results. If, a century ago, Rousseau- 
ism meant Thja Rights of Man, to-day Rousseauism 
carried to its logical conclusion means Socialism. 
And as we find that it was he who furnished the 
Revolution with its vocabulary, so we may trace his 
principles in the propaganda of the Socialistic agita- 
tion of the present day. Hence a reaction has set in. 
Some of the greatest critics of France have presented 
the negative side of Rousseau and Rousseauism, and 
one wonders why their books have not been trans- 
lated into English. Surely, at the present juncture 
of American politics, we cannot afford to ignore this 
intellectual movement of our sister republic; for 
only such a reaction can show us, children of Jean- 
Jacques that we are, how the malady of his dream- 
ing has invaded our conceptions of politics, life, and 
art. 

It may be that we are unable to change it. Many 
cannot recognize the evil, many will not ; and these 
latter would maintain that there is no trace of disease 
in our Rousseauistic individualism. Admitted evils 
they would explain as necessary, on the analogy of 
the bacterial life which is a concomitant of health in 
the human system. To such as these it is of no use 
to read Faguet's book on Democracy, "The Cult of 
Incompetence." They will assure us that they alone 
represent democratic ideals, since they are in the 
majority ; and as they are in the majority, it is plain 
that they must await the final development of Rous- 
seauism and the argument of events. If the equali- 
tarian chimaera brings us a syndicalistic State, war 
and militarism will inevitably follow ; and then per- 
haps we shall all, as equals, enjoy the sweet convic- 
tion of force majeure. 

Certainly, if the Industrial Revolution is on its 
way, no anti- Rousseauistic argument is likely to stop 
it. It will come, and our only consolation must be 
the thought that it will also come to an end. Twelve 
years after the French beheaded Louis XVI., they 
were obliged to call in a military dictator to save 



their State from annihilation. So if we are to have 
syndicalism, or some other form of direct proletarian 
democracy, it might be well to aid it discreetly, just 
as in certain maladies physicians employ a serum 
obtained from the diseased blood of the patient. 

In point of fact, we are doing this very thing. For 
Rousseauism in politics depends upon Rousseauism 
in education. It was Jean-Jacques who first stood 
for pedagogic naturalism, so intolerant of discipline 
and the direct training of the character and the will. 
If we consider our present educational system, most 
of its features are ultimately traceable to Rous- 
seau. What do our schools and colleges stand for 
to-day ? Interest, amusement, rather than set tasks ; 
election of congenial studies (since life has in store 
for us no uncongenial labors); non-sectarianism ; and 
then, absence of all that religious training which 
makes character; neglect of philosophy and meta- 
physics which make thinkers (what need have we of 
thinkers?); predominance of natural sciences, which 
are mainly nomenclatures, over that harder intellec- 
tual training which makes leaders (why should we 
train leaders, being a democracy?); predominance of 
utilitarian subjects and manual training over history 
(what can we, the heirs of all the ages, learn from 
a dry and dusty Past?). Yes, if the incapacity of 
our present school and college students be taken into 
account, if we consider their weakness in thinking, 
in character, and in power of self-control, we must 
admit that we are educating our children up to the 
requirements of a socialistic or syndicalistic Utopia. 

Furthermore, we are helping matters in other 
ways. Rousseauism in the schools goes hand in 
hand with Rousseauism in Art and Literature, since 
artist and public are alike trained to prefer an 
emotional naturalism to the "aristocratic" beauty 
of self-control. What Jean-Jacques has given us in 
the excesses of the Romantic school, what his ideals 
of aesthetics are giving us to-day, such critics as 
Monsieur Lasserre and our own Professor Babbitt 
have shown us; "Le Romantisme Francais" and 
"The New LaokoCn" will perhaps mark an epoch 
in the history of the ideas of the twentieth century. 
In our industrial civilization, where many have 
come to see in Art and Literature only a form of 
amusement or a titillation of the senses, where the 
excesses of certain persons have degraded the very 
connotation of the adjective "artistic," such books 
as these ought to open our eyes to the future of Art 
and Letters under present conditions. If critics and 
artists do not unite in the formulation of a more 
virile ideal, the whole subject of Art may find itself 
relegated to that feminine control which Herbert 
Spencer prophesied as its ultimate function. Shall 
we then confess that we are incapable of rising above 
the lower aesthetic conception of transcending the 
Romantic subjection to passion and sentiment for 
the classical inspiration of intellectual vision? 

Of course, the former conception is the first to 
move our sympathies. It is difficult to rise to an 
appreciation of the more virile elements in literature. 
It is difficult to discount the Romantic element, to

hold it in a subordinate position, to keep it in control. 
Yet we must do it. And we need not fear that its 
better qualities will thereby be lost. We need not 
fear that Rousseau's contribution to us will be vitiated 
by a little anti-Rousseauism. History in all its bloody 
cycles, life and politics to-day, literature itself, indi- 
cate that of all the factors which control human life 
and human activities, passion is the one that plays 
in our despite the largest part As thinkers, as 
observers, we may deny its predominance, we may 
believe ourselves immune. But our immunity ends 
when we cease to think. If we make a choice, if 
we descend from contemplation to action, it is pas- 
sion, spontaneous or intellectualized, that compels us 
thereto. Shall it be the former type, the type for 
which Jean- Jacques mainly stands? Or shall we, 
through a judicious study of an ti- Rousseau ism, turn 
passion against itself, and give our energies, not 
merely to a humanitarian but also to a humanistic

CASUAL COMMENT. 



CONVENTIONS OF LITKRART ART, the things men 
and women in books are represented as doing and 
saying in certain circumstances, are often very dif- 
ferent from the things they really would do and say 
in the given circumstances. Yet how can great and 
soul-moving scenes be depicted without a consider- 
able employment of these conventions, these well- 
understood symbols to indicate to the reader what 
is taking place? The older romancers made their 
heroines weep and swoon and go into hysterics with 
astonishing facility. The story required it. and to 
remove these manifestations of feeling would be to 
leave the context flat and feeble and often all but 
meaningless. As Mr. Arthur C. Benson points out 
in an article on "Realism in Fiction" in the May 
"Cornhill," the conscientious realist of our own time 
often finds himself in a dilemma between his devo- 
tion to realism and his need to give some sort of 
adequate expression to high emotion and profound 
feeling. A situation fraught with passion and sen- 
timent of the most intense nature is often in real 
life chiefly remarkable for the outward calm and 
the perfect self-restraint of all concerned. "It is 
certainly my experience," says Mr. Benson, "and I 
should imagine the experience of everyone in En- 
gland at all events, that in scenes and situations 
where the atmosphere is tense with emotion, the 
most amazing fact is the incredibly commonplace 
things which people say and do. In the most tragic 
scene which I can call to mind, the conversation was 
mainly about the weather; it was an intense relief 
to everyone present that anyone should have been 
sensible enough to introduce the subject" How, 
then, shall the realist picture and not merely >lc 
scribe at wearisome length and in disenchanting 
detail the intense situation, the moment of over- 
whelming passion, of prostrating grief, of ecstatic 



emotion? Successfully to solve the problem, as it 
arises, is to demonstrate one's genius as a literary 
artist . . . 

LIBRARY WORK WITH THK BOOK-HUNGRY IMMI- 
GRANT seems not infrequently to inert with \\;u m.-r 
appreciation and to yield more gratifying results 
than does similar effort bestowed upon our own peo- 
ple. At the Providence Public Library this work 
appears to be zealously and fruitfully prosecuted. 
In the current annual Report of the library we read: 
"As in previous years, the service rendered by this 
department is two-fold. On the one hand, it serves 
the readers of foreign birth and parcnta^f who 
otherwise would have but scanty means of obtaining 
reading matter, and, on the other hand, it nerves 
the readers of American birth and descent who 
would gladly make themselves familiar with the rich 
resources of other literatures than their own. . . . 
Large as is the benefit rendered by the Foreign De- 
partment in these directions, its service to the newly- 
arrived representative of other nationalities is even 
greater. In the hands of the vigilant and enter- 
prising Custodian of the Department, Mi Reid, its 
work has almost risen to the level of an active philan- 
thropic agency. . . . Some of the noteworthy fea- 
tures of this department are the sympathetic interest 
in the readers, together with the total absence of a 
patronizing attitude, which have always character- 
ized its work." The making of American citizens out 
of the crude material so abundantly offered in our 
manufacturing towns may now be reckoned a part of 
the task likely to be imposed upon the library worker. 



THE WIDENER BEQUEST TO HARVARD, being the 
valuable collection of rare and what may be briefly 
called "association" volumes that is, books en- 
deared by old associations and often bearing some 
mark to indicate these associations comes into the 
possession of the Harvard library with a sad pre- 
maturity, through the death of the testator ( Harry 
Elkins Widener) in the awful shipwreck of April 
14-15. Mr. Widener, though a young man and 
hardly more than started in his labor of love as a 
book-collector, had already gathered a library unsur- 
passed in its way by any similar collection. Among 
its treasures are mentioned Shakespeare folios, and 
autograph or otherwise valuable copies of books 
by Dickens, Cowper, Browning, Charlotte Bronte*, 
Byron, and Robert Louis Stevenson, the Steven- 
soniana being especially noteworthy. Some of the 
latter, including, it is reported, the original manu- 
script of Stevenson's fragment of autobiography, 
were lost in the disaster that cost their owner 
his life. The first Hoe sale had greatly enriched 
the collection, and further sales of the same great 
library, as also the important forthcoming auction 
sales of other famous libraries, would doubtless have 
left in Mr. Widener's hands a large number of liter- 
ary treasures to add to his store. By the terms of 
the will, the collection is to go to Harvard when the 
university shall have made proper provision for the 



1912.]

care of the precious bequest. If this clause hastens 
the erection of a new building to take the place of 
old Gore Hall, Mr. Widener will have rendered a 
double service to Harvard and to the larger world of 
letters. . . . 

THE LITEKARY NEEDS OF THE MANY must often 

conflict with the scholarly demands of the few in 
that work of purveying to the reading public which 
constitutes the never-ending and often perplexing 
task of the free library. A significant passage at 
the opening of the twenty-second annual Report of 
the Minneapolis Public Library is of interest in this 
connection. "Before entering upon the details of 
this report," says the librarian, " we wish to speak of 
a criticism, more or less just, which has been passed 
upon the work of the library. All criticisms are 
welcomed, and many of them are valuable. This 
particular criticism, in brief, charges that the library, 
in attempting to reach the many in a large extension 
policy, has somewhat overlooked or neglected the 
needs of the more scholarly. It is true that in build- 
ing up new branches, and in opening numerous sta- 
tions and factory libraries, much of the book fund 
has been consumed in the purchase of standard lit- 
erature and duplicate materials. The extension work 
has certainly crowded upon the more scholarly side 
of the library. The purchase of expensive works 
and those attracting but a limited number of readers 
has been often postponed until these titles could be 
obtained at a cheaper rate. The criticism is well 
taken, and it is to be regretted that the book fund 
will not stretch any farther." The wise policy of the 
greatest good to the greatest number will always, 
and unavoidably, cause some discontent among the 
cultured few, for the public library is and should 
ever remain a democratic rather than an aristocratic 
institution. ... 

AN OBVIOUS MISPRINT in an otherwise perfect bit 
of poetry or prose always tempts the nicely critical 
reader to note the correction in the margin rather 
than run the risk of letting the error jar and confuse 
a succession of subsequent readers. In Browning's 
poem "The Worst of It" the sixth stanza is printed 
in all the editions, so far as we know, as follows : 
" And I to have tempted you ! I, who tried 
Your soul, no doubt, till it sank ! Unwise, 

I loved, and was lowly, loved and aspired, 
Loved, grieving or glad, till I made you mad, 

And you meant to have hated and despised 
Whereas, you deceived me nor inquired ! " 

Now, as in all the other eighteen stanzas of the poem 
the first, third, and sixth lines are made to rhyme 
except in the second, where it is the first, third, and 
fifth that rhyme one feels it a wanton blemish that 
here alone the rhyme should be spoiled when by 
simply transposing the r and i of " tried " both rhyme 
and sense are restored. Browning's syntax may at 
times be labyrinthine, and his metre now and then 
jolty ; but when he essays rhymed verse he is not so 
poor in resource as to be forced to content himself 
with so imperfect a consonance as that here noted. 
Accordingly it is with some satisfaction that we find 



a writer in the London "Telegraph" describing an 
interview with the poet in which the latter, on hav- 
ing his attention called to the passage, cried, with 
"delighted laughter," "Why, of course! It ought 
to be 'tired' the rhyme is obvious enough. And 
nobody ever saw it before ! " 

ONE METHOD OF BOOK-SELECTION is to pick the 
volumes one most hungers for, let the critics and 
the connoisseurs say what they will. Another way 
is to follow blindly and slavishly the judgment of 
some one or more recognized authorities. An unex- 
pected employment of the second method comes to 
public notice in the mention made by Mr. George 
W. Smalley (in his just-published second series of 
"Anglo-American Memories ") of the library at Skibo 
Castle. It appears that in this collection of the 
famous founder of libraries for the people ' there are 
some five-and-twenty thousand volumes, all chosen 
by the late Lord Acton." "What could be more 
stimulating," continues Mr. Smalley, "than to look 
over the collection of books which Lord Acton had 
thought suitable as a library for Mr. Carnegie? 
You saw the meeting of two minds, each highly 
remarkable and as unlike as it was possible for two 
minds to be." At any rate, this method of furnish- 
ing one's house with a ready-made library is prefer- 
able to that sometimes resorted to by the excessively 
wealthy, the indiscriminate purchase of absurdly 
costly and notoriously worthless subscription books 
and sets of books. Better than that, because less 
wasteful of money and less encouraging of humbug, 
is it to fill one's shelves with book-shaped blocks of 
wood, handsomely backed and tooled and lettered. 
Then when the evil day comes and the price of coal 
soars, you will still have a good supply of excellent 
and well-seasoned fuel. 

... 

WEAR AND TEAR IN A LARGE LIBRARY, an ener- 
getic, up-to-date library that does its best to serve 
the community maintaining it, necessarily amounts 
to a good deal each year in terms of dollars and 
cents. For example, the Brooklyn Public Library, 
as indicated in its current Report, discarded last 
year worn-out volumes to the number of nearly thirty 
thousand, .or more than half as many as were added 
in the same time; and in the last ten years one 
hundred and sixty-nine thousand volumes have been 
sent to the rubbish heap. This last number is not 
far from one-quarter of the total number of books in 
the library, and indicates a commendable' (though 
costly) vigilance in keeping the collection in good 
dress-parade order. The question of durable binding 
is an important one in this connection, and a state- 
ment from the assistant librarian in the same Report 
emphasizes the superior quality of work done by the 
Chivers Bookbinding Company in rebinding and 
oversewing. Expenditure for replacement has been 
reduced by employing the services of this company, 
and the money thus saved has been used in buying 
new books. But after all care and economy has been 
exercised on the public library's part, the public 



45s 



THE DIAL 



itself is still lamentably thoughtless and ungentle in 
its handling of the books provided for its enjoyment. 
No volume needs to be gripped by the reader as if 
its two halves were the two handles of a plough, nor 
does it respond kindly to such rude buffeting as one 
might give to a football. 



THE STRENGTH AND THE WEAKNESS OF AMERI- 
CAN UNIVERSITIES, as pointed out by one whom we 
have already more than once quoted in these columns, 
Professor Murray of Oxford, were thus expressed 
in an alleged interview shortly before the English 
scholar's departure from our shores. "The features 
of the American universities which particularly im- 
pressed me," are his reported words, "were their 
excellent libraries, the swift effectiveness with which 
they punish or drop men who do not pass examina- 
tion-, ami the vivid, vigorous spirit which colors and 
animates the whole of their university life." He 
deplored the excessive addiction to athletic contests 
and other distractions, as also the recent rapid decline 
of classical study. " Deep decay has eaten into the 
study of the classics in America," he declared, u and 
there is widespread consciousness of it The decay 
is in part due to Dr. Eliot's policy at Harvard. He 
abolished compulsory Greek. It wan an experiment 
which should have been tried in a laboratory less 
noble than Harvard." While he cannot but admire 
the general effectiveness of the training sought by 
the average energetic American, he thinks the time 
has come " which demands deeper, more solid, and 
therefore slower, education." 



HUMORS OF THE BOOK-AUCTION ROOM ought to 
furnish some industrious compiler with material for a 
highly entertaining volume. Among recent curious 
happenings of interest to the purchaser of autographs, 
there comes from the auction rooms of the Anderson 
Company, where the library of the late historian 
Lossing has been passing under the hammer, the 
story of the unheard-of prices commanded by two 
letters of Colonel Zebulon Butler, of Revolutionary 
fame, and especially associated in history with the 
so-called Massacre of Wyoming. The letters in ques- 
tion were rated at about eight and ten dollars apiece, 
the brave Zebulon not being by any means a star of 
the first magnitude in the autographic firmament. 
But when they were put up at auction they amazed 
all beholders by bringing four hundred and sixty and 
five hundred and fifty-five dollars respectively. The 
reason for this furious bidding was later found to 
be the fact that two descendants of Andrew Adams, 
to whom the letters were addressed, had given each 
an unlimited order for the letters to an agent, a differ- 
ent agent in each case, with no expectation of any 
active counter-bidding from any quarter. 



THE INCREASING GLUT OF THE BOOK-MARKET, 

the large preponderance of quantity over quality in 
the wares offered, must sooner or later compel a halt 
in the recklessly rapid production of printed matter. 
A writer in the London "Daily News" who signs 



himself "A British Puhli.shrr" recognizes the harm 
that is being done to the trade by an over-production 
that in the last decade has mounted by leaps and 
bounds beyond all precedent. From the five thou- 
sand new English works issued in 1901 to the eight 
thousand five hundred of the last calendar year is a 
long stride, and ruinously in excess of any increase 
in demand during the same period. With the larger 
book-production the profit on any one work tends to 
diminish, and so, to make up for this diminution, the 
publisher is tempted to make his output still more 
disproportionate to the demand a policy obviously 
leading to ruin if persisted in. Manifestly, a gen- 
eral agreement among publishers to adopt a policy 
of restriction is what is needed. But who is to bring 
about this agreement or enforce its terms after it has 
been adopted? Like many other evils, this one of 
over-production is sure to correct itself, more or less 
crudely and clumsily and imperfectly, in the course 
of time; but a more speedy and effective and less 
ruinously expensive remedy is earnestly to be desired. 


ACTIVITIES OF THE A. L. A. PUBLISHING BOARD, 
an organization formed in 1 886 (ten years after the 
founding of the American Library Association itself) 
" to further cooperation among libraries in preparing 
and publishing bibliographies, indexes, and special 
catalogues," are thus far responsible for the issue of 
between eighty and ninety publications in book or 
pamphlet form, of which about sixty are at present 
in print. Mr. Henry E. Legler, librarian of the 
Chicago Public Library, is chairman of the board, 
and Mr. George B. Utley secretary. It is from a re- 
cently published statement of the latter that we learn 
how beneficently and unselfishly active the board 
has been in the quarter-century since its formation. 
The well-known " A. L. A. Catalogue " and " A. L. A. 
Index to General Literature " and "A. L. A. Portrait 
Index" are among the most valuable publications 
of the board ; and it now has in preparation a work 
that will be not less useful in its way to those whom 
it primarily concerns. It is a manual of library 
economy, each chapter written by a specialist in his 
particular department of library work, and will con- 
tain about twenty-six chapters, ten of which have 
already been issued as separate pamphlets. The edi- 
torship is vested in a special committee whose chair- 
man is Mr. J. I. Wyer, Jr., Director of the New York 
State Library. . . . 

THE AWARD OF A FRENCH LITERARY I-RI/K of 
ten thousand francs to M. Andre" Lafon for his piece 
of fiction entitled "L'Eleve Gilles" is announced in 
Paris. It is the Grand Literary Prize offered regu- 
larly by the French Academy for the best work of 
imagination and inspiration produced within the ]>n- 
ceding two years. The committee of award at first 
favored the recognition of some acknowledged writer 
of talent rather than the crowning of any single bril- 
liant production of an unknown hand: hut thin nat- 
urally led to interminable discussions and dissensions, 
with the intermixture of personal prejudices and

THE DIAL 



459 



animosities. Consequently, as has often happened 
before and will often happen again in such elections, 
the choice of a "dark horse" was forced upon the 
electors; and M. Lafon proves this time to be the 
lucky man. Not that it is all luck, however, for a suffi- 
ciently trustworthy authority pronounces "L'Eleve 
Gilles" to be "simple et tres profond." But we are 
still far from being assured that as a spur to genius 
the literary prize of so-and-so many francs or dollars 
or ducats is really productive of works destined to 
live, or that even the most carefully selected profes- 
sional critics can discern the qualities that are likely 
to ensure this immortality. 


AN AGREEABLE INNOVATION, among other agree- 
able experiences encountered in Boston by our late 
English visitor, Mr. Arnold Bennett, and noted by 
him in his contribution to the current issue of 
"Harper's Magazine," was the nature of the reading 
matter he found awaiting him in his hotel room. 
He says: "When I got to the entirely admirable 
hotel I found a book in a prominent situation on the 
writing table in my room. In many hotels this book 
would have been the Bible. But here it was the 
catalogue of the hotel library ; it ran to 182 pages. 
On the other hand, there was no bar in the hotel, 
and no smoking-room. I make no comments; I 
draw no conclusions; I state the facts." It is safe 
to say that the number of hotels in England, or 
indeed in all Europe, that have their own libraries 
and their own printed catalogues of their libraries 
could be counted on the fingers of one hand, with 
not far from five fingers left over after the enumer- 
ation ; and this, of course, is only one small item in 
the splendid story of the growth and spread of the 
library idea in America as compared with its less 
general and rapid extension in the Old World. 



A GLIMPSE OF SHAKESPEARE'S ENGLAND is easily 
to be had this summer by the Londoner or the visitor 
to London. At the Earl's Court Exhibition Grounds, 
between South Kensington and West Brompton, is to 
be seen a realistic though somewhat jumbled-together 
reproduction of the streets and houses of Elizabethan 
London, the market place at Exeter, the Salisbury 
Cross, the main street of Lynton, the old Globe Thea- 
tre of Shakespeare fame, the Fortune Theatre for 
sixteenth-century dances and music, Shakespeare's 
bookstall, Ann Hathaway's cottage, Plymouth Har- 
bor with the battleship " Revenge " riding proudly at 
anchor, and other sights of long ago all called into 
being from the irrevocable past by the zeal and munif- 
icence of Mrs. Cornwallis West in aid of the Shake- 
speare Memorial Theatre Fund. 



"THE EDINBURGH REVIEW" UNDER NEW EDIT- 
ORSHIP, the seventh editorship since Francis Jeffrey 
held sway at the founding of the celebrated Liberal 
quarterly a century and a decade ago, will con- 
sistently maintain, announce the publishers, the 
principles advocated by the " Edinburgh " from the 
beginning. Its traditions, continues the announce- 



ment, "have been to inculcate a sane and individualist 
Liberalism, and under its new editor the 'Review' 
will be as strongly opposed to democratic tyranny 
and democratic corruption as it was in the early years 
of the nineteenth century to the tyranny and corrup- 
tion of an aristocracy. It will continue to defend 
the unity of the kingdom and to advocate those 
principles of personal liberty and personal respon- 
sibility from which Liberalism should never be 
divorced. . . . Every endeavour will be made to 
maintain the reputation of the Review for fair- 
minded and tolerant criticism in literature and art, 
and in the future, as in the past, cordial welcome will 
always be given to new ideas and new movements 
for the advancement of the nation." The new editor 
is Mr. Harold Cox, and the next number will be the 
first to enjoy the benefit of his editorial skill. 



ONE TEST OF LITERARY QUALITY, easy to apply, 
was brought to the attention of the American Book- 
sellers' Association, at its late convention in New 
York, by Mr. E. W. Mumford, of the Penn Pub- 
lishing Company. The subject of his thoughtful 
and admirable address was " Juvenile Readers as an 
Asset," and he spoke an energetic word for raising 
the standard of children's books handled by the 
dealers that is, for wiser discrimination on the 
bookseller's part in selecting his juvenile stock. 
The cooperation of parents is necessary in this 
toning up of the book-market, and one way in which 
they can make their children ashamed of a low 
taste in story-books is to make them read some of 
the trash aloud. " One boy," said Mr. Mumford, 
" was cured of the dime novel habit by making him 
read out loud. He was really ashamed to give open 
expression to its improbabilities and cheap heroics. 
The glamor of many a modern juvenile would fade 
under this test." 



COMMUNICA TION. 

LIBRARY BORROWERS AND CIRCULATION. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Concerning your recent paragraph on the number of 
borrowers according to the population of a town, may I 
be allowed to suggest that statistics of borrowers which 
do not also include the statistics of circulation do not 
mean much? I have in mind a library which reports 
over 14,000 borrowers and a circulation of less than 
70,000 books, while other libraries with less than 8,000 
borrowers circulate nearly 80,000 books. Why borrow- 
ers if they do not borrow ? 

The only difference can be that in the former case 
the list of borrowers has not been revised for years, and 
is no doubt many times the actual number of active 
borrowers ; while in the latter case, the list is kept more 
nearly down to the real number. 

It is true that "statistics have a bad reputation," and 
in perhaps no other field do they often mean so little 
as in that of the library. ELLA F CORWIN,

TALKS ON FAMOUS ETCHERS.* 



It might be supposed that a book on Etchings 
forming a part of ' The Connoisseur's Library " 
would give a clear and comprehensive account 
of the etching process and the cognate processes 
of dry-point and aquatint, would then deal with 
the beauties and limitations of the results obtain- 
able by their employment, and place before the 
reader descriptions of the noteworthy achieve- 
ments of the artists who have used them success- 
fully, furnishing also lists of the most highly 
esteemed plates and indicating in each instance 
the preferable state. Apparently, however, Sir 
Frederick Wedmore's conception is that the 
series to which he contributes aims not so much 
to educate connoisseurs as to entertain them ; so 
he considers it needless to attempt to tell the 
reader " what constitutes a good Etching in the 
abstract " or " what subjects and what moods 
this particular Art favours." Instead he tells 
what he thinks of the best-known practitioners 
of the art. 

Personality rather than performance is what 
interests Sir Frederick most. This book is more 
about etchers than etchings. It is made up of 
informal discourse in a rambling and jerky style, 
abounding in many parentheses. The following 
extract is characteristic, though it contains only 
two instances of the extraordinary use of capi- 
tals that the author affects. He speaks of Mr. 
William Strang. 

" Strang has been extraordinarily prolific. Hundreds 
of plates landscapes and figure pieces, allegory and 
realism have been chronicled by Mr. Laurence Binyon 
a grave, noteworthy personality: a serious thoughtful 
student in just such a volume as it'is apparently at 
present (witness, for instance, the vast book which dis- 
plays the performances of Mr. Brangwyn) the fondest 
aim of the ambitious, pertinacious Etcher to know is in 
existence about him. Far am I from saying that amongst 
those hundreds of pieces amongst these ' many inven- 
tions ' there are not numerous examples of Mr. 
Strang's capacity to entertain visions of Beauty. His 
dreams that come to him so constantly: that come 
nearly as easily as words do to a Welshman his dreams 
are really not quite all of them nightmares." 

The caustic tone of these remarks is exceptional. 
For the most part the work of the several artists 
whom the author passes in review is looked upon 
with an indulgent eye. There is a constant effort 
to find as much as possible to praise. Occasion- 
ally he bestows dubious compliments, as when 
he prefaces an appreciation of the work of Axel 

Bromxos. By Frederick Wedmore. Illustrated. "The 
Connoisseur'* Library." New York : O. P. Putnam's Son*. 



Haig by saying he will speak of him with per- 
haps no accent of personal 'iitliusi;iMii, 1'iit with 
a measure of respect that is not invariably ac- 
corded him." In strong contrast to this is his 
warm commendation of a " little Set " of etchings 
by Veyrassat, which he does not hesitate to clas- 
sify as "some of the most distinguished cm/nix 
wrought in all the years since men have etched." 
Whistler he is sure would have put his name to 
them with satisfaction. 

Hesitation in expressing opinion is not one of 
Sir Frederick's shortcomings. Nevertheless he 
discreetly avoids committing himself upon diffi- 
cult matters of connoisseurship, as in the case 
of the etchings formerly attributed to Rembrandt 
but now regarded as of doubtful origin. The 
deft way in which he dodges the questions raised 
by these etchings is amusing. He admits that 
" It is necessary of course, in writing about Rem- 
brandt or in studying him, to take account of 
this matter. But it would be a mistake here to 
pursue it in detail." Hence 

We have moved, in this chapter, where we were 
entitled to move among accepted pieces. We were 
entitled because it is very seldom, in the case of any 
master, that the chefs d'cmvre, and those that are in line 
with the chefs d'ceuvre, and therefore fit in any way to 
be remotely compared with them, are questioned at all. 
As a rule, the critic who is busy with doubtful attribu- 
tions, is busy with the second-rate." 

The longest chapters in the book are those de- 
voted to Rembrandt and Whistler, twelve pages 
being accorded to one and a few lines more than 
that space to the other. The inadequacy of this 
to give anything like a comprehensive view of 
the work of either of these artists is so obvious 
that it savors of supererogation to point it out. 
What should be said of an appreciation of 
Rembrandt as an etcher that fails to make any 
mention of such important plates as " The Three 
Trees " or " The Death of the Virgin " ? It can 
scarcely be that the author does not find these 
works interesting. Yet he professes to give a 
brief chronological survey of the master's achieve- 
ment in this special field, and he assigns dates 
with a confidence that a more careful student 
would find difficulty in sharing. His assertion 
that " It was not till 1651 that we get the first 
of the nude women," is a case in point. 

In the main the author's estimates of the ar- 
tistic worth of the etchings he sees fit to name are 
well considered. Few discriminating connois- 
seurs, for example, would question his rating of 
the " Clement de Jonghe" as the greatest of 
Rembrandt's etched portraits. But when he 
transforms Whistler's comment upon it into a 
glorification of Tintoretto the reader may well 



1912.] 



THE DIAL 



461 



be amazed. This is Sir Frederick's version of 
Mr. Whistler's statement: 

" And yet more interesting is it to be assured, as we 
have been lately assured, on evidence irrefutable, of 
how Whistler regarded it. He praised not often, but 
of this, what he said was, ' Without flaw: beautiful as a 
canvas by Tintoret beyond which there is nothing.'" 

Whistler, like other men, may have had sins to 
answer for, but he never could have made a state- 
ment so palpably absurd as this. What he did 
say was inscribed by him and signed with the 
butterfly signature upon the mount of a marvel- 
lous impression of the third state (according 
to Dutuit's classification) of the "Clement de 
Jonghe," now in a Chicago collection : 

" Without flaw ! Beautiful as a Greek marble or a 
canvas by Tintoret. 

"A masterpiece in all its elements beyond which 
there is nothing." 

This and Sir Frederick's distorted version, it 
will be perceived, are as wide apart as the poles. 
It is a pity that the incorrect statement should 
be given currency by being printed in a volume 
of an important series and vouched for " on evi- 
dence irrefutable " by an author so well known 
as Sir Frederick Wedmore. 

The chapters dealing with other etchers are 
quite as cursory as the one about Rembrandt. 
That concerning Whistler is merely "a little 
sketch-map " of his career as an etcher. In 
mentioning Mr. Howard Mansfield's "Catalogue 
of Whistler's Etchings and Dry- Points," to 
which he accords generous praise, and the illus- 
trated catalogue issued by the Grolier Club, the 
author questions the advisability of "the mul- 
tiplication of States " that they encourage, and 
says "It is possible it seems to me to be 
too elaborate for lucidity too intricate for 
practical convenience." Yet in commenting 
upon the " Clement de Jonghe " he remarks that 
"Little changes unimportant to mention, but 
not unimportant to avoid, have caused deterio- 
ration in the second " state of the print. How, 
it may be asked, is the collector to know about 
these differences if they are not to be mentioned ? 

Apparently Sir Frederick Wedmore has 
attempted in this volume to do again what 
Hamerton accomplished in his " Etching and 
Etchers." In a way he has brought that work 
down to date, though without Hamerton's liter- 
ary skill and charm of style ; and he overlooks 
some of our best American etchers, such as 
Charles A. Platt, J. Alden Weir, and Cadwal- 
lader Washburn. To have written a volume 
of two hundred and thirty pages upon a techni- 
cal subject and put in so very little information 



is, after all, something of a feat. Yet it fur- 
nishes agreeable reading, and the forty-four 
excellent reproductions of notable etchings make 
the book worth having.

A RATIONAL VIEW or THE 
SUPERNATURAL.* 



It seemed inevitable that sooner or later such 
a book as Mr. Tuckett's " The Evidence for the 
Supernatural" would come to be written, that 
once the tidal wave of mysticism spread by the 
precipitate conclusions of " Psychic Researchers ' ' 
had spent its force and inundated defenceless 
positions, the sturdy common sense character- 
istic of Huxley's countrymen would assert itself. 
That the critical review when it came should 
be so thorough in execution, so broad in treat- 
ment, so acceptable in form and content, is a 
cause for congratulation in the rationalistic 
camp. The author's misgiving that his sub-title 
would lay him open to the charge of egotism 
may be readily dismissed ; it is not the least of 
the merits of the book that it shows so clearly the 
necessity of trained judgment and the saturation 
of the inquiring mind with the saving grace of 
logical rectitude, sustained in turn by psycho- 
logical insight, for a safe conduct through the 
tangled thickets from which so many a traveller 
returns with strange tales and stranger beliefs. 

Mr. Tuckett, among whose titles of distinc- 
tion is that of Senior Demonstrator of Physiology 
in Cambridge University, upholds the traditions 
of his scientific fraternity with a directness of 
purpose reflected in simple and effective address. 
He conveys a sense of mastery of his material 
that is indeed sufficiently " uncommon " to de- 
serve favorable mention. With the dissector's 
sense of structure he manages to strip each 
subject of its enshrouding envelopes of acquired 
prejudice and confusion, and to deal directly 
with the flesh-and-blood reality underlying the 
presentable argument. In many hands this 
treatment might readily lead to a charge of 
irreverence, for the subjects of the dissection 
involve the intimate facts of our being and des- 
tiny about which cherished beliefs and hallowed 
views have been built up. Mr. Tuckett's con- 
sideration is at once calm and sympathetic ; his 
knife is applied to save, not to injure. The 
personal candor which pervades the whole dis- 
arms criticism and compels attention.

The treatment is broad, though suggestive. 
It considers three orders of inquiry : first, the 
inherent logic of vexed issues, the nature of 
truth and evidence, the psychological prejudices 
and logical pit-falls that beset the procedure 
through which intellectual emancipation is 
achieved ; second, the examination of the prob- 
lems of " Psychical Research " and the proposed 
conclusions favoring a supernatural interpreta- 
tion of this type of occurrence ; third, the par- 
allel survey of the supernatural beliefs espoused 
by dominant religions. To this is added, by 
way of constructive compensation, a lucid state- 
ment of the agnostic position, offering food for 
all, irrespective of philosophy or religious be- 
lief. A series of appendices gives confirmatory 
data and citations, and gives an analytical 
review of Mrs. Piper's revelational (or inquisi- 
tional) sittings which is quite the best diagnosis 
yet put forth of this illusive and defiant candi- 
date for supernatural honors. 

It would be comforting to believe that the 
mid- Victorian illumination of the logic of sci- 
ence had done its work so thoroughly that the 
fruits thereof would become the natural heritage 
of succeeding generations. Yet despite the 
reinforced contributions of Mill, Lewes, Lecky, 
Huxley, Clifford, Morley, White, and others in 
brilliant succession, it would appear that the les- 
son must be set anew to each generation, almost 
for each situation ; the personal element is so 
insistent that vicarious experience carries but a 
feeble moral. The fundamental clue to the reason 
why men and women of ordinary and extraordi- 
nary sturdiness of mind go wrong in the alluring 
purlieus of "Psychical Research" remains a 
logical one. Truth and evidence seem objective 
enough ; and with charted seas, light-houses, and 
compass, it would appear that anyone with com- 
mon sense and a fair experience could steer a 
sea- worthy vessel safely to port. Yet the frailty 
of human reasoning is writ large on every page 
of history ; and the fall of man through partak- 
ing of the tree of too little knowledge is quite 
as truly the story of logical as of moral imper- 
fection. We talk glibly of the prejudices, as 
of the superstitions, of our ancestors and of our 
neighbors ; and we realize these forces, for the 
most part, sincerely, tolerantly, and understand- 
ingly. But bias spreads its roots tenaciously 
in the sub-soil, conditioning growth in a way 
not revealed on the surface. There seems, too, 
a peculiar atmosphere of the seance chamber 
hostile to lucid rationality. Even men of large 
intellectual calibre and trained judgment seem 
to lose or drop the aegis of their armament when 



confronted with a " medium " claiming trans- 
cendental powers and strangely violating, while 
professedly conforming to, the rules of scientific 
procedure. Mr. Tuckett's chapters on "Truth 
and Evidence" are highly pertinent. They are 
addressed to " the man-in-tlii'-.street/'and though 
intended for home consumption will >aiVI\ U.-ar

Modern Spiritualism, an American product 
of lowly origin, represents the leit-motif in the 
movement of ** Psychical Research." This is 
significant; for its affiliations are ancient, with 
varied and rich development among primi- 
tive peoples. This cultural connection is well 
brought out by Mr. Tuckett, who cites parallels 
in the beliefs, practice, and conclusions among 
unenlightened devotees to the most recent so- 
berly recorded message from the beyond. The 
presence of scientific instruments, a stenographic 
record, and the academic credentials of the 
sitters fail to obscure the resemblance. The 
hypothesis finds its complement and its rival 
in telepathy, which is the scientific formulation 
of the power to transcend ordinary limitations 
of sense ; its cultural analogue is the belief in 
second-sight (clairvoyance) of favored individ- 
uals. The argument when stated statistically 
seems to carry conclusion with the sacredness 
attaching to numbers ; but the qualities ascribed 
to them as reinforcements of beliefs aroused and 
cherished by quite other considerations are no 
less subjective, however radically unlike the mys- 
tical ascriptions of the most devout Pythagoreans 
of Hellenicor mediaeval cast of mind. Mr. Tuckett 
subjects the evidence for telepathy to a critical 
analysis. It all comes back to a sense of logical 
solidarity ; knowledge is limited, but the temper 
to which it yields is abundantly manifest. The 
universe is imperfectly known ; but the dom- 
inant trend of its phenomena forms a goodly 
and after all a fairly consistent bit of doctrine. 
Shall we modestly recognize the manifold gaps 
in our constantly revised system, or shall we 
peer through these openings for strange light 
that shines not on sea or land of our accredited 
domain? Professor James was wont to regard 
the answer as determined by our sense of the 
dramatic possibilities. Mr. Tuckett finds in 
the dossier of the case a great contribution to 
the psychology of bias. 

At first sight a relation between the argu- 
ment for telepathy and for the efficacy of prayer 
seems strange. Granted the preliminaries of Mi. 
Tuckett's position and the logical analogy fol- 
lows, and leads naturally to the discussion of 
miracles, which has always occupied the centre

of the stage in the drama of the supernatural. 
The spirit of the inquiry is here broadened. 
Logical value gives way to psychological inter- 
est ; for prayer and miracles become " varieties 
of religious experience " in the sense familiar- 
ized by James. These we may project upon a 
foreign background, and thus withdraw undue 
attention from the veridical features, while ob- 
serving their common function of ministering to 
spiritual satisfaction and the generic features 
of psychological conformity to type which such 
experiences present despite contrasts of setting 
and alien habits of mind. Here, too, pathology 
of the mind enters ; hallucinations have taken 
the guise of revelations ; abnormal susceptibility 
may be associated with the possession of alleged 
supernormal powers. The inclusive query re- 
mains : Why may not the comprehension of 
the manifestations grouped about prayer and 
miracles, and the tendency to credit supernatural 
powers of revelation, proceed by mutual illu- 
mination ? The spirit of the drama is quite 
independent of the stage setting ; interests and 
their expression exert a mutual influence upon 
one another, yet reveal similarity of source and 
appeal in and through the diversity of culture. 

Whether or not investigations in "Psychical 
Research " can or should influence one's atti- 
tude towards experiences most conveniently 
called spiritual, towards a group of beliefs that 
have always attracted the interests of men, 
towards the conception of the universe, and the 
bearing of science upon the conduct of life, is a 
question which Mr. Tuckett includes within the 
scope of his survey. He sets forth the founda- 
tions of the agnostic position, and compares its 
offerings even to the concreteness of parallel 
columns with those of more positive religious 
faiths. The spirit of tolerance has so far tri- 
umphed that such argument proceeds nowadays 
with mutual respect of rival protagonists and a 
relieving absence of suggestions of moral lapse. 
There is no doubt that philosophical inclinations 
have now an easier approach to a respectful 
hearing than in the days when heresy was a 
convenient charge for an uncongenial position. 
With this increased privilege comes the obliga- 
tion and opportunity to achieve an intellectual 
conformity of thought and sympathy that is char- 
acteristically modern, even recent, and which in 
turn determines the manner of interest in, and 
the attitude towards, the significance and bear- 
ing of "Psychical Research." Views are not 
so much refuted as outgrown. Mr. Tuckett's 
volume is at once a factor and an aid in this 
consummation. JogEpH J ASTROW> 



BASSETT'S LiIPE OF ANDREW JACKSON.* 

The appearance of the Life of Andrew Jack- 
son, upon which Professor John Spencer Bassett 
of Smith College has long been engaged, gratifies 
the expectant reader. Based upon a painstak- 
ing examination of the voluminous manuscript 
papers of President Jackson, this work, more 
nearly than any of its numerous predecessors, 
intimately and justly portrays the character of 
one of the most remarkable of Americans. 

In the first volume Professor Bassett traces 
Jackson's career from his birth (as to which he 
accepts Jackson's own belief that he was born 
in South Carolina) through the oppressed boy- 
hood of the Revolutionary period, the youthful 
shif tings in North and South Carolina, the early 
duelling and judging and Indian fighting, the 
rise to fame in military affairs, the crowning 
glory of New Orleans, and the evolution of the 
frontier general into a presidential candidate. 
This volume closes with the election of 1824; 
thus there is left for the second volume the cam- 
paign against Adams, the two presidential terms, 
and the declining years, to Jackson's death, in 
1845, at the age of seventy-eight. When one 
compares the periods of time allotted to the re- 
spective volumes, fifty-seven years to the first 
and twenty-one to the second, it would seem hard 
to suggest a fairer division ; yet the second vol- 
ume leaves one with the sense of compression, as 
if the story had been hurriedly brought to a close. 
This feeling involves not so much the details of 
the life, for these are kept before one to the end. 
The relation which Jackson, as the central figure, 
bore to the purely political phase of the period 
could hardly be presented in better proportion. 
The account of the rivalry with Calhoun and the 
struggle with Clay is masterly. It is to the deeper 
economic and social forces which Jackson repre- 
sented that one wishes the author might have 
given more space. It is indeed attempted, and 
with all success, to give summaries of the prob- 
lems of Jackson's administrations, the craze 
for internal improvements, the difficulties of the 
system of finance and banking, the friction in 
Indian relations and in foreign relations, the con- 
flict as to the proper policy in the administration 
of the public lands. But Jackson's own relation 
to the questions which his administration brought 
before him, and his own point of view as deter- 
mined or strongly influenced by the experience 
of his own State, might, in the opinion of the 
reviewer, be more clearly brought out.

Thus, as to the problem of the public lands, 
it was Tennessee that educated Thomas Hart 
Benton to be the exponent of the views of the 
frontier. As to the banks, it was Tennessee (as 
Professor Sumner, in his book on Jackson, did 
not fail to observe) in which Jackson stormed 
at the first relief " bank of this section of the 
Mississippi Valley, declaring his distrust of all 
banks. Again, in connection with the story of 
Georgia and the Cherokees, is it not worth noting 
that the Cherokee country extended into Tennes- 
see as well as into Georgia, Alabama, and North 
Carolina, and that after John Marshall's decis- 
ion in Worcester vs. Georgia, a law was passed 
in Tennessee to extend the jurisdiction of the 
State over the Indians, and a test case carried 
through the highest courts of the State to a 
decision adverse to that of Marshall : while the 
Chief Justice of Tennessee who rendered this 
decision was soon promoted to the Supreme 
Court of the United States by the nomination 
of Andrew Jackson ? In treating of the policy 
of Jackson towards the Indians, Professor 
Bassett indeed says: " Jackson, however, had a 
Western man's view of the Indian question. 
He showed it by a determination to appoint a 
Westerner secretary of war." He might have 
added, and the addition, we believe, would 
be enlightening, that the whole cohort of 
Tennesseans in Washington was set at work 
to accomplish the " Western " policy. In the 
House of Representatives, John Bell was made 
the chairman of the committee on Indian rela- 
tions ; in the Senate, in the similar chairman- 
ship, Hugh Lawson White led the administra- 
tion's forces. Strangely enough, of all the 
Tennessee delegation it was only the typical 
and eccentric backwoodsman, David Crockett, 
already at odds with Jackson, who arose to 
plead the cause of the poor Indian. 

But we recognize that Professor Bassett has 
undertaken to write a life of Jackson, not a 
history of his times. For what he has done he 
is entitled to the warmest praise. We have 
found but few errors of fact. In the first 
volume, two may be noted. On page 25, it is 
stated that * By an act of May 26, 1790, con- 
gress organized the country between the Ohio 
and the present states of Alabama and Missis- 
sippi as 'The Territory of the United States 
Southwest of the River Ohio.' ' This statement 
is incorrect: Kentucky was admitted to the 
Union as a district of Virginia, and was never 
ceded to the United States, as North Carolina 
had ceded the Tennessee country. Again, page 
28, it is argued that the position of representa- 



tive in Congress was reserved by the leaders for 
Jackson because he was strong with the people 
and this was "a single oilier which depended 
on the suffrages of all the people." On the 
contrary, the governor was elected by popular 
vote. In this respect the Tennessee constitution 
of 1796 made a notable advance over that of 
the mother-state, North Carolina. 

The work is embellished with reproductions 
of the Sully, Healy, Carter, and Earl portraits 
of the General, and others of a daguerreotype 
by Adams and a miniature by Vallee. Tin it- 
are also reproductions of a drawing of the 
Hermitage and an engraving of a miniature 
of Mrs. Jackson by Anna C. Peale. There are 
two maps, one illustrating Jackson's operations 
in the Creek country and around Mobile in 
1813-1814, and the other the movements of 
the armies around New Orleans. The printing 
is for the most part well done. Somewhat unusu- 
ally, and perhaps to the confusion of those who 
may wish to refer to the work, the paging is 
carried consecutively through the two volumes.

A NEW STUDY OF POETRY.* 



Professor Jack, the author of a brilliant study 
of the poetry of Shelley, has of course long since 
won his spurs in the lists of criticism. In his 
new volume on " Poetry and Prose " he discusses 
the work of some seven poets of the eighteenth 
and nineteenth centuries, with the fundamental 
purpose of demonstrating how these poets illus- 
trate the description of poetry with which his 
volume opens. 

Mr. Jack is too sensible to undertake an exact 
definition of poetry. The most he attempts to 
do is to describe it. Perhaps one may best char- 
acterize his attitude by saying that he resolutely 
exalts the mood of the poet. 

" Prose is the language of cool reason, Poetry that of 
ecstasy. It follows that Prose is the language of speech, 
normal, without rhythm, balanced, like a highway road, 
a straight line, a stick, the sentences coining to an end 
and joining into one another imperceptibly ; and that 
Poetry is the language of song, at least of rhythm for 
utterance, when excited, takes to itself a rhythmk- cjiuil- 
ity. Poetry is what man utters when he loses his balance, 
his normality the high and low notes of emotion." 

Acceptance of this doctrine of course depends on 
the sense which we are willing to attach to the 
words " ecstasy " and " loss of balance or normal- 
ity." Taken in the ordinary sense, it seems to us

that they present an extreme view of the poetic 
mood. But compare it now with this passage a 
little further on : 

"Prose is Is, the ever-present fact, to-day; Poetry, 
in love with yesterday and to-morrow, flies to the cool 
night and away from noon to the cool night with its 
silences and the riddle of the unnumbered stars. Prose 
deals with things as they are school, marriage, wills, 
dress, law, civilisation, order and degree. Poetry is oc- 
cupied with the bases of these birth, love, and death, 
human passions, men." 

From this it appears that it is not so much with 
the non-normal as with the commonplace that 
prose has to deal. It is perhaps unfortunate 
that Mr. Jack uses the word normal in this sense. 
For the usual, or common, and the normal are 
not necessarily identical; and to say that the 
poetic mood is not as normal to man as the mood 
of prose is inexact and misleading. The last two 
sentences of the quotation, too, seem to us unfor- 
tunate, since they tend to draw attention to the 
material with which the poet deals. It is not, how- 
ever, the matter but the mood that counts. To 
accept Mr. Jack's words literally would compel 
one to rule out poems like Spenser's "Epitha- 
lamion" and the conclusion of " In Memoriam," 
as well as such lines as 

" Move upward, working out the beast, 
And let the ape and tiger die." 

Likewise this, which is surely not the least poetic 
stanza of " The Palace of Art ": 
" And one, an English home gray twilight pour'd 

On dewy pastures, dewy trees, 
Softer than sleep all things in order stored, 
A haunt of ancient Peace." 

Of course Mr. Jack means nothing of the kind. 
What he does mean, as we infer from his context, 
is that in a general way school, while it lasts, is 
a prosaic, not to say distasteful, matter; that 
marriage, when it suggests merely settlements 
and household economies, is likewise incapable 
of arousing the poetic fervor. 

We follow our author more readily when he 
says that " the use of the poetic imagination com- 
municates an ideal pleasure, a pleasure derived 
ultimately from the realization by the soul of its 
own freedom in regard to the world." Or, as 
one might put it, poetry is the voice of the infi- 
nite in man. 

Mr. Jack now takes up some of the kinds of 
poetry, and first the poetry of the young man and 
of the mature man. By the poetry of maturity 
he means that which "is concerned immediately 
with the feeling itself and is occupied solely in 
expressing the feeling as felt. . . . Some experi- 
ence comes to the poet and he reverberates with 
a sympathetic cry." The most concrete instance 



of this he finds to be Wordsworth's lines on the 
death of Lucy : 

" A slumber did my spirit seal ; 

I had no human fears: 
She seemed a thing that could not feel 
The touch of earthly years. 

" No motion has she now, no force; 

She neither hears nor sees: 
Rolled round in earth's diurnal course, 
With rocks, and stones, and trees." 

Perhaps impressions are of no great consequence, 
but it seems to us that these lines are distinctly 
the work of a young man; it may be recalled 
that Wordsworth wrote them at twenty-nine. 
We grant that the first six lines are a simple 
and "perfect" expression of the vital contrasted 
with the inanimate; but what of the last two 
lines? Is not this the thought of a young man, 
who is not expressing the naked feeling that the 
loss of Lucy brings? The thought of earth's 
diurnal course is an intellectual concept, a matter 
of science. The young man, then, is not so far 
from the "normal " but that he thinks of this 
fact and connects Lucy's remains with other 
revolving objects.* And (though this is aside 
from the main question) is it not after all a poor 
way of characterizing inanimity, for do not the 
living revolve with the dead? We will only add 
that if the two lines be justified by Words worth- 
ians on the ground of their being emotion recol- 
lected in tranquillity, then the expression of such 
emotion is to us not convincing. 

The poetry of the young, Mr. Jack believes to 
be that in which the expression is less deeply con- 
trolled by the emotion ; it is " the rhapsody of 
appreciation. The young poet is more alive than 
any other young man, though all young men are 
more alive than mature men to the beauty and 
charm of colour, glory of sight, delight of scent, 
which is in the world, as also he is more alive to 
the delicate ecstasies of newly awakened feeling." 
To illustrate this the author quotes from Keats 
and from Shakespeare's early plays. But un- 
fortunately for his nomenclature, he admits that 
we occasionally find the same sort of thing in 
Shakespeare's later plays. Would it not be bet- 
ter, then, instead of distinguishing between the 
poetry of maturity and that of immaturity, to 
say that the difference is not so much of kind 
as of the degree to which the emotion controls 
the expression? 

* Compare Tennyson's 

" Break, thou deep vase of chilling tears, 

That grief hath shaken into frost." 

the effect of which is similar, because it is an invasion by 
science into the domain of poetry. 



THE DIAL 



[June 16, 



Mr. Jack is quite right in saying that " poetry 
is not description, it is sympathetic emotion." 
A passage is poetical to the degree in which the 
description, brief or prolonged, rises out of and 
conveys, with sustained effect, the emotion of 
the poet. There must be a unity of impression ; 
a poem, long or short, must impress us as a 
whole. Sometimes, however, " the impression 
is not poetical, as in * The Ring and the Book/ 
and this is because the whole, allowing for 
surprising spurts of emotion, is the result of an 
intellectual process." 

To discuss this passage leads us into a large 
question. Is " The Ring and the Book " a poem ? 
Is it poetical in its effect? Applying the rigor- 
ous standard propounded by Mr. Jack, we must 
answer in the negative. Only in spots does 
the poet come anywhere near the poetic madness 
posited by Mr. Jack's description. Yet we 
cannot believe that this is quite conclusive. 
For it must be borne in mind that " The Ring 
and the Book" is a dramatic poem. Except 
in the prologue and the conclusion, the poet is 
depicting not his own state of mind and feeling 
but that of nine other persons, namely, three 
citizens of Rome,, the three chief actors in the 
drama, the two lawyers, and the Pope who 
pronounces the final judgment. Obviously a 
lyrical standard, which will apply to the singer's 
personal expression, cannot be the same as a 
dramatic standard, which will apply to all the 
other persons represented by the poet as speak- 
ing. The utmost that we can require of char- 
acters dramatically conceived in poetry is that 
they shall be so far removed from the common- 
place as never to suggest it or reflect it. That 
is, they must be conceived with ideal skill and 
speak and act with ideal propriety. They need 
not, nay, they cannot, always exhibit a non- 
normal state of mind; it is enough if they 
exhibit this high poetic feeling when the dra- 
matic situation demands it. Nobody expects 
poetry in the narrowest sense from the Roman 
citizens who present their views of the tragedy ; 
or from the lawyers, who provide a kind of 
comic relief. But we do expect the protagonists, 
the persons vitally concerned in this dark trag- 
edy, to speak and act at climactic points as 
becomes denizens of the world of poetry. Let us 
see how Browning manages this. At his exam- 
ination, speaking of the flight, Caponsacchi is 
reported in " the Old Yellow Book " to have said : 

" Accordingly, at about one o'clock in the morning, 
she came alone to the said gate. We entered the car 
and turned along outside of the city wall to go to the 
gate of San Spirito, which is in the direction of Perugia." 



This is how Browning renders it : 

' And thus 

Through each familiar hindrance of the day 
Did I make steadily for its hour and end, 
Felt time's old barrier-growth of right and tit 
Give way through all its twines, and let me go. 
Use and wont recognized the excepted man, 
Let speed the special service, and I sped 
Till, at the dead between midnight and morn, 
There was I at the goal, before the gate, 
With a tune in the ears, low leading up to loud, 
A light in the eyes, faint that would soon be flare, 
Ever some spiritual witness new and new 
In faster frequence, crowding solitude 
To watch the way o' the warfare, till, at last, 
When the ecstatic minute must bring birth, 
Began a whiteness in the distance, waxed 
Whiter and whiter, near grew and more near, 
Till it was she: there did Pompilia come: 
The white I saw shine through her was her soul's, 
Certainly, for the body was one black, 
Black from head down to foot. She did not speak, 
Glided into the carriage, so a cloud 
Gathers the moon up. By San Spirito, 
To Rome, as if the road burned underneath ! 
Reach Rome, then hold my head in pledge, I pay 
The run and the risk to heart's content!' Just that, 
I said, then, in another tick of time, 
Sprang, was beside her, she and I alone." 

In the Old Yellow Book, as is well known, there 
is no suggestion of love between Caponsacchi 
and Pompilia, except from their enemies. Their 
mutual love in the poem is entirely the creation 
of Browning, and this it is which removes the 
story from the commonplace of an ordinary trial 
and surrounds it with the atmosphere of poetry. 
We do not forget that the intellectually conceived 
purpose of the poem, as expressed at the outset, 
was to furnish an object lesson on how the poet 
by a mysterious alchemy makes poetry out of 
the raw material of fact, as well as to show how 
difficult is the course of Truth in the world, 
though she will ultimately come to her own and 
triumph. That is all very true ; but the poet, as 
it were, forgets all about this purpose, so that 
in the hist chapter, "The Book and the Ring," 
we have only leave-takings, last echoes of the 
trial, the execution, the lawyers' complaints ; and 
then at the end the words, didactic indeed but 
emotionally phrased, about the mission of art 

Art may tell a truth 

Obliquely, do the thing shall breed the thought, 
Nor wrong the thought, missing the mediate word. 
So may you paint your picture, twice show truth, 
Beyond mere imagery on the wall, 
So, note by note, bring music from your mind, 
Deeper than ever the Andante dived, 
So write a book shall mean beyond the facts, 
Suffice the eye and save the soul beside." 

We should be inclined, then, to say that the 
prevailing impression made by " The Ring and

the Book" is poetical. The intellectual process 
has been lost to sight in the artistic transforma- 
tion of the characters as dramatically conceived 
and presented. 

The poets whom Mr. Jack discusses and the 
varieties of poetic activity they respectively rep- 
resent, are Gray (social or prose poetry), Burns 
(natural or spontaneous poetry), Wordsworth 
(basic or elemental poetry), Byron (oratorical 
poetry), Emerson (didactic poetry), Arnold (crit- 
ical or reflective poetry), and Meredith (intel- 
lectual poetry). It will be noted that epic and 
dramatic poetry have no place in the list; it is 
with lyric poetry that Mr. Jack is in the main 
concerned. We shall not quarrel further with 
our critic, for with most of what he says we are 
in hearty accord.* He has a fine and accurate 
critical sense. We would call special attention 
to his remarks on Burns's love poetry (pp. 81-5); 
his subtle analysis of the " Ode on Immortality " 
(pp. 110-16) ; and his close examination of the 
style of Meredith (pp. 205ff.). In short, he has 
produced an illuminating and suggestive study 
of poetry, which no student can afford to ignore.

A COOPERATIVE HISTORY OF THE 
MIDDLE AGES.* 



It is now nearly a century since Leopold von 
Ranke began his wonderful career as student of 
history and master workman in the little guild 
of historical investigators. Since that day the 
advance of historical science has been almost 
marvellous. Ranke's work furnished not only 
inspiration but standards and methods. The 
influence of the German ideals is clearly seen 
in the vast collections of documentary materials 
and the innumerable monographs on themes, 
both great and trifling, that have been pub- 
lished during the past two generations. 

These activities have also compelled a change 
in the method of writing histories of the general 
type. The task that Edward Gibbon undertook 
would to-day seem almost impossible. Histo- 
rians who write extended works find themselves 
revising the first volume before the second is 
finished. The only way out of present difficul- 

*THE CAMBRIDGE MEDIEVAL HISTORY. Planned by 
J. B. Bury, M.A. Edited by H. M. Gwatkin, M.A., and 
J. P. Whitney, D.D. Volume I. New York: The Mac- 
millan Co. 



ties seems to be through cooperative work. Of 
cooperative histories we have two chief types : 
one, in which each contributor deals with a 
period of some extent, one that can be conven- 
iently treated in a single volume ; and another 
composed of a series of brief monographs, each 
making a chapter or part of a chapter in a 
volume of related studies. The latter type is 
best illustrated by "The Cambridge Modern 
History," a massive work of twelve bulky vol- 
umes that has just seen completion. 

The Cambridge plan has been severely criti- 
cized as one that sacrifices unity and continuity 
of style and narrative in order to secure the 
last conclusion and the most recent view of the 
specialist. But the Cambridge historians still 
have faith in the correctness and practicability 
of Lord Acton's ideas. A " Cambridge History 
of English Literature " has recently been pre- 
pared according to the Cambridge plan. And 
now we have the initial volume of a new venture, 
" The Cambridge Medieval History." 

It was eminently proper that this work should 
be planned by Lord Acton's successor in the 
Regius professorship, Professor J. B. Bury. It 
is also appropriate that the writing of a history 
that must necessarily give particular attention to 
the mediaeval church should be done under the 
supervision of scholars who have positive church 
interests: the first volume has been edited by 
the church historian, Dr. H. M. Gwatkin, and 
by the Rev. J. P. Whitney. The work begins 
with the reign of Constantine, and the first vol- 
ume covers roughly two centuries, the fourth 
and the fifth. Eight volumes will complete the 
work. When the last chapter is written, Cam- 
bridge University will have given us a continuous 
narrative of the world's history since the decline 
of Rome sixteen centuries of decline and pro- 
gress in twenty large and carefully written 
volumes. With all its shortcomings, the series 
is a most notable undertaking; it will be many 
years before the student of the past can afford 
to neglect the Cambridge histories. 

It is an essential part of the Cambridge plan 
to find and enlist the services of the most eminent 
specialists, not only in England but elsewhere. 
Whether all the writers who have contributed to 
the present volume belong to this class may well 
be doubted ; but no fault can be found with the 
choice of contributors in most instances. The 
chapters on Constantine and Arianism are from 
the pen of Professor Gwatkin. For an account 
of the Asiatic background of the Hunnish and 
other Mongol invasions, the editors have gone to 
Dr. T. Peisker of Graz. An Irish abbot, Dom

E. C. Butler, writes on monasticism. Professor 
Paul Vinogradoff, the economic historian, sums 
up the social situation in the fourth century. 
Other contributors who have acquired more than 
local fame are Professor F. J. Haverfield of 
Oxford, Professor M. Dumoulin of Paris, and 
Dr. M. Manitius of Dresden. 

The editors inform us that the work follows 
the general lines of Lord Acton's plan, but 
with a few improvements of detail suggested by 
experience." What these improvements are the 
reviewer has not been able to determine. In all 
the externals of print, binding, arrangement of 
materials, etc., this volume bears a close resem- 
blance to those of the Modern History. In its 
treatment of events it is more philosophic than 
the earlier work, one of whose chief defects lies 
in a failure to subordinate minor details. The 
present volume has more discussion and fewer 
details. But this is not necessarily due to a 
conscious effort on the part of the writers : the 
nature of the sources and the poverty of the doc- 
uments are such that a highly detailed account 
becomes impossible. 

It seems, however, that a conscious attempt 
has been made not merely to chronicle passing 
events, but also to discuss somewhat fully the 
social, institutional, and intellectual aspects of 
the age. This purpose appears in such chapters 
as those on the reorganization of the empire; 
the organization of the church ; monasticism ; 
social and economic conditions ; thoughts and 
ideas of the period ; and early Christian art. 
Dr. Peisker's chapter on the nomadic life of the 
steppes can scarcely be called history at all ; 
nevertheless, it is an exceedingly suggestive and 
informing discussion, and adds much to the 
value of the work. 

A volume of this sort, embodying as it does 
the views of twenty historians, can in the nature 
of things have no single view-point. But differ- 
ing view-points need not necessarily be contra- 
dictory or hostile. It must be said that, on the 
whole, the editors have succeeded remarkably 
well in fitting the chapters and parts of chapters 
together in such a way as to avoid a too evident 
clash of opinions. In a brief review it is not 
possible to indicate the divergent views or the 
new views that may be found in a text of more 
than six hundred large pages; the reviewer 
therefore wishes to limit himself to a brief state- 
ment of the opinions advanced by Dr. Martin 
Bang and Dr. Peisker as to racial origins. 

A generation ago it was held that the Indo- 
European race originated somewhere in Central 
Asia and came into Europe as an invading peo- 



ple. Recent scholars have rejected this hy|>oth- 
esis, some even going so far as to doubt the 
existence of any such race. But Dr. Bang, who 
writes the chapter on " The Expansion of the Teu- 
tons," holds with the archaeologists of tin- North 
that the Indo-European race is not a fiction, but 
that its origin was European not Asiatic. 

"The earliest home of the Teutons was in the coun- 
tries surrounding the western extremity of the Baltic 
Sea, comprising what is now the south of Sweden, 
Jutland with Schleswig-Holstein, the German Baltic 
coast to about the Oder, and the islands with which the 
sea is studded as far as Gothland. This, not Asia, is 
the region which, with a certain extension south, as far, 
say, as the great mountain chain of central Germany, 
may be described as the cradle of the Indo-Germanic 
race. According to all appearance, this was the centre 
from which it impelled its successive waves of population 
towards the west, south, and southeast, to take possession, 
in the end, of all Europe and even of a part of Asia." 

This expansion of the race seems to have been 
completed by 1500 B. C. A fragment remained 
behind in the original home, where it developed 
into the group of tribes and nations that we call 
the Teutons or Germans, whose migrations in 
the fourth and fifth centuries overwhelmed the 
ancient world. 

But what Asia loses in Dr. Bang's chapter it 
regains to some extent in a later discussion. Dr. 
Peisker emphasizes the Mongolian element in the 
European peoples, an element which he finds all 
through eastern and southeastern Europe : " the 
Mongol type of features extends westwards to 
Bavaria and Wiirttemberg." The Roumanians 
need no longer boast of Roman descent ; like the 
Huns and Bulgarians, they are of Asiatic origin. 
descendants of nomads from the steppes. The 
same the author holds to be true of several other 
European peoples whom we usually do not think 
of as of Turanian stock. If Dr. Peisker is cor- 
rect, more than half of the population of Europe 
must have descended from Asiatic fathers and 
European mothers. 

And like the peasantry among which they wintered 
(and winter) long enough, they became (and become) 
after a transitory bilingualism, Greeks, Albanians, Ser- 
vians, Bulgarians, Rutheniaus, Poles, Slovaks, Chekhs, 
Slovenes, Croatians, seeing that they appeared there 
not as a compact body, but as a mobile nomad stratum 
among a strange-tongued and more numerous peasant 
element, and not till later did they take to agriculture 
and themselves become settled." 

It has long been realized that purity of race 
is a mere fiction ; but as to the various ingredi- 
ents in the different racial mixtures, there is no 
general agreement. To the settlement of these 
problems, the present volume appears to have 
brought an important contribution.

SOME RECENT DRAMAS.* 

Mr. Zangwill's ''The War God," quite aside from 
its significance as a document in the movement for 
Peace, is a vigorous and well-wrought drama, dar- 
ingly using verse form for a play realistic in setting 
and detail, and by no means failing in the literary 
aspect of the work. At times the writer drops below 
the level demanded of blank verse, and he indulges 
in an irritating and entirely unnecessary clipping of 
words ; but, broadly speaking, the literary technique 
is adequate, while there can be no question as to the 
dramatic values or noble largeness of the theme. Mr. 
Zangwill is working with increasing effectiveness in 
the dramatic form. 

It is worth noting that Mr. Kennedy's new and 
striking piece, "The Terrible Meek," is a variant of 
the same subject: he cries up the coming of Peace, 
even as does Mr. Zangwill. Much silly and mislead- 
ing criticism has been directed against this drama, 
since its production at the Little Theatre in New 
York. The reader discovers that here is a one-act 
play very novel in method and design, played for 
forty minutes in darkness, but showing plainly in its 
dialogue how certain soldiers are turned away from 
their profession by the words of a poor mother bewail- 
ing the execution of her son. Her meekness, and 
that of her child, is terrible in its non-resistance. 
The final clearing-away of the mists to reveal, not 
modern England, but Palestine, with the three figures 
on the cross, is simply making visual the allegory, 
and none but the philistine could take it otherwise. 
The play is a beautiful, impressive, and altogether 
legitimate work.

Pigeon," also produced at the Little Theatre, two 
strictures may be made : first, that it has no plot in 
the conventional sense; and second, that it proves 
nothing, that it has no. proposition, in the argot of 
dramaturgy. But Mr. Galsworthy is a social student ; 
and with the most sympathetic characterization, 
happy dialogue, and atmospheric visualization, he has 
here shown us the dangers in two opposing methods 
of charity : the impulsive kind-hearted personal sort, 
represented by the painter who is the gull of the 
piece, and the organized philanthropy which leaves 
the heart cold. Just as in " Strife," the author states 
the case, and lets us make the inference; nor does 
he ever forget that a play is an entertainment. 
Certainly the waifs and strays of his latest drama 
furnish this latter quality in abundance. 

Mr. Percy MacKaye continues to add to an al- 
ready large and varied list of plays, increasing with 
each new volume one's sense of his resources. 
"To-Morrow" shows him in sympathy with such 
dramatic thinkers as Ibsen and Brieux in their social 
biologies. It is an interesting essay in eugenics ; and 
also, to our mind, an interesting play. Why should 
not the daughter of a scientist father be so educated 
as to regard clean blood in her suitor as important as 
blue eyes? Her decision is justified, and a final scene 
of real power finds her aligned with the right man. 
Mr. MacKaye does not consider it necessary to be 
" unhappy " at the end, in order to drive his lesson 
home. 

The same author's group of one-act plays, " Yankee 
Fantasies," reminds us how steadily this promising 
dramatic form is gaining. It should become thor- 
oughly domesticated, for it offers opportunities of 
broad brush-work superior to the longer play, and 
often brings us back to the essentials of drama, 
stripped of all padding. The work in this volume 
might be described as the poetic and imaginative 
handling of homely realistic material; and in such 
examples as "Sam Average" and "The Cat Boat" 
the result is convincing. In a piece like " Chuck " 
the symbolism may possibly overlie the dramatic 
texture too thickly ; but Mr. MacKaye's idealism is 
refreshing in contrast with the frequent sordid insist- 
ence upon the other extreme. An unobtrusive note 
of patriotism breathes through the entire book, and 
the atmosphere is richly and enjoyably that of New 
England. 

Popular interest in the work of Strindberg will 
be quickened by his death, especially as many of his 
plays are now being brought out in America. The 
latest addition is a fairly good English version of his 
"FrOken Julie," described by the author as "a nat- 
uralistic tragedy." It is a brutal study of opposed 
types ; and of the two persons, the aristocratic woman 
and the valet to whom she stoops, it were hard to 
say which is the more repellant. So far as such a 
work has any use or meaning, it would appear to be 
an exposure of the worst features of both upper and 
lower classes, done with the grim, uncompromising 
realism for which Strindberg is famous, Yet one

can but sigh that so much power should be expended 
upon such a result One has a right to challenge this 
kind of literature with the inevitable Cui bonof 

From Strindberg's " Frdken Julie " to Mr. Arnold 
Bennett's "Polite Farces" is a change indeed! 
These light, clever, keen one-act sketches are built 
for parlor dimensions; and while not an important 
part of Mr. Bennett's product, they serve their pur- 
pose of intelligent amusement. The best of the three 
is "The Stepmother," but u A Good Woman " is full 
of fun and skilfully handled. " A Question of Sex " 
seems less successful because of the assumed condi- 
tions. Given the drawing-room environment, all of 
them should go well, and they certainly are pleasant 
to read. 

Tchekhof ranks among the leaders of latter-day 
Russian fiction and drama, and the appearance of 
two of his representative plays in a capital transla- 
tion is therefore welcome. After their perusal, 
however, one is tempted to doubt the Russian gift 
for play-making. The dramas of Tolstoy, Gorky, 
Andrev, and Tchekhof have a hundred virtues ; but 
that particular virtue which consists of so telling a 
story in dramatic form as to lead up to an essential 
and compelling climax, the Slav cannot boast. Of 
these two pieces of Tchekhof, "The Seagull" and 
"The Cherry Orchard," the former is the more 
dramatic, and is unquestionably interesting for its 
character study; but it is a visualized narrative of 
love at cross purposes rather than a drama. As for 
the second, the reader is fairly dazed as the dra- 
matis persona drifts off and on, and he grasps like 
a drowning man for a straw at the incident of the 
sale of an orchard, whereby is revealed the tendency 
of upper-class folk in the land of the Czar to talk 
eternally and never act ven the informing Intro- 
duction by the translator. Mr. George Calderon, 
cannot convince us that "atmosphere dialogue" is a 
substitute for "action dialogue." 

Two versions appear almost simultaneously of 
Tolstoy's striking posthumous play," "The Living 
Corpse," which has aroused considerable discussion 
abroad, and has been played in several countries. 
The idea of an unworthy husband allowing his wife 
to think him dead so that she may secure a divorce 
and marry another, is an excellent one for dramatic 
purposes, and a dramatist such as M. Bernstein would 
have made it thrilling. But in the hands of the great 
Russian it is a fine theme told in narrative rather 
than dramatic fashion. Valuable as it is for its knowl- 
edge of the types, and arresting as it is in individual 
scenes, judged as structure, growth, and climax it is 
emphatically material mishandled. Printed with 
one of the versions is a one-act sketch called "The 
Cause of It All," which is open to the same criticism, 
modified because less of drama is needed ; as a study 
of poverty and a screed on temperance, it serves its 
purpose, and has ethical significance. 

Still another posthumous play by Tolstoy is " The 
Light That Shines in Darkness." This has a special 
interest, quite aside from any artistic consideration, 



in that it seems to have some autobiographic signifi- 
cance. In the opinion of some, at least, the tragedy 
which darkened the great writer's last days, his fol- 
lowing of the dictates of conscience and so separating 
himself from his home and dear ones, is reproduced 
in a veiled way in this drama, which portrays a man 
who clashes with family and friends because he holds 
the Tolstoyian doctrine of non-resistance, poverty, 
and brotherly love. It is incomplete, the fifth act 
being merely sketched out; but even in its pr* 
form it is a deeply moving piece of literature, with a 
direct simplicity and earnestness far more effective 
than any stage tricks could make it 

Decidedly able work is to be found in the volume 
of three plays by Mr. Maurice Baring, whose literary 
labor has of late been many-sided. All these plays 
have the merit of naturalness of character-sketching 
and dialogue; and if the motives be comparatively 
tenuous, much is made of them. The additional 
merit of variety, too, is possessed by the author. 
"The Grey Stocking" is an Ibsenesque piece, with 
the quiet tone which brings out well a tense situation, 
sad and logical as life itself. "The Green Elephant." 
in vivid contrast, is melodrama, of the same genre 
as "The Thief." And the third, "The Double 
Game," is a picture of Russian revolutionary life 
with a tragic culmination, an intimate revelation, 
one feels, based upon real knowledge. 

Mr. S. M. Fox is an English dramatist hitherto 
unknown to most of us; but he deserves serious 
consideration. For a clever seizing of contemporary 
moods, keen and witty dialogue, and the right set- 
ting of character in scene, his work is capital. "The 
Waters of Bitterness " is a poignant bit of psychology 
possessed of real pathos and power; while "The 
Clodhopper " is delicious fun in the way of a satire 
on the latter-day mannish woman. Mr. Fox is a 
frank partisan, but both sides should succumb to his 
gay humor. At its best, his dialogue rivals that of 
Oscar Wilde. " The Waters of Bitterness " has been 
produced by the English Stage Society. 

A well-known latter-day German dramatist is 
Otto Ernst; and "Master Flachsmann," now iran-- 
lated by Mr. H. M. Beatty, is one of his best pieces. 
Even if it were not an excellent satiric comedy, 
clean in construction, keen in characterization, and 
life-like in dialogue, it would still be a valuable 
educational document, for it gives in vivid contrast 
the ideals of the old and new pedagogic dispensation. 
The picture of the old-time narrow pedant bully is 
1 as laugh-provoking as that of Dickens's Gradgnml. 
and as true. His overthrow by Flemming, a sym- 
pathetic portrait of a genuine teacher and educa- 
tional idealist, makes fine comedy, the sort that 
obeys Meredith by leaving a thoughtful smile on 
the reader's face. The translation is very accurate, 
erring, indeed, a little on the side of liti-rality. 
"My God" is not the true English equivalent of 
Mein Gott, nor can the Du of endearment be lifted 
bodily into our tongue.

BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS. 

The greatest " We in En g land al<e apt to cling SO 

of Russian blindly to half-truths that we con- 

reaiists. sider the statement of the other half- 

truths a mere joke, which may or may not be 
amusing." So observes Mr. J. A. T. Lloyd in his 
volume on "A Great Russian Realist: Feodor 
Dostoieffsky " (Lane); and his book is a sternly ear- 
nest effort to bring the "self-contented spirit of the 
West" to some conception of the "inner pain of 
Russia." All of us who have come into personal 
contact with Russians, and have looked with amaze- 
ment into depths and vistas of which the Germanic 
peoples and the Latins alike are utterly devoid, will 
follow Mr. Lloyd's effort sympathetically, even 
though it is evident from the beginning that this 
fervent Russophile, being himself an Anglo-Saxon, 
is almost as helpless as a man without eyes trying 
to describe the sun to his blind fellow-men. The 
most successful parts of the book are citations of 
certain lurid and haunting pages which will certainly 
grip all readers not already familiar with Dostoieff- 
sky, and will impel them to seek first-hand informa- 
tion about his works, which are available in translation 
although they have been very little read in this coun- 
try. To Mr. Lloyd the Russian novel is the greatest 
of all, and he ranks Dostoieffsky as the greatest, or 
at least the most typical, of Russian novelists. His 
reasons for these judgments are at least deserving of 
respectful consideration. If the best fiction is that 
which approaches the most sympathetically and 
faithfully to the life of the emotions, neither the 
close-mouthed Englishman nor the super-educated 
Frenchman nor the docile and cautious German has 
produced anything worthy to rank with the works of 
this infinitely pitiful and infinitely curious, absolutely 
spontaneous, shameless, unassuming combination of 
dreamer and unsparing realist, Feodor Dostoieffsky. 
His life, as poignant, as terrible, as chaotic, and as 
astonishing as the strangest of his books, ended 
thirty years ago. At the time of his death, his name 
was almost unknown in this country. Now special 
students of Russian literature are writing books about 
him ; perhaps in a few years more he will receive 
from the reading public a small share, at least, of the 
attention he deserves as the most Russian of all great 
Russian novelists. For the Russian is swayed by his 
emotions, and to quote Mr. Lloyd again : "Turgenev 
had caught as an artist the want of the vast silent 
country; Tolstoy had reasoned upon it, and explained 
it; but the want was in the heart of Dostoieffsky." 

New studies of Mr< HilaI 7 A - Herbert, ex-Secretary 
the anti-slavery of the Navy, has written a volume 
conflict. on u The Abolition Crusade and Its 

Consequences" (Scribner), the main thesis of which 
is that responsibility for the tragedy connected with 
the ending of slavery in this country is to be traced 
directly to the organization of the Abolition Move- 
ment, by William Lloyd Garrison, in 1831. Mr. 
Herbert writes in good temper, and there is much 



truth in his volume difficult to be found in books 
written from the Northern standpoint. But no one 
who has gone to the bottom of the slavery question 
can believe that the great struggle which culminated 
with the Civil War would have been obviated if the 
fates had in some way turned the attention of the 
individual William Lloyd Garrison in some other 
direction. In asserting that in Garrison's view the 
most humane slave-holders were wicked monsters 
and fiends, the author shows himself not quite suffi- 
ciently well acquainted with Garrison's own words. 
Garrison's hatred was for the sin of slavery, not for 
the slave-holder personally. Mr. Herbert of course 
believes that the more or less outspoken opposition 
to slavery which existed in the South itself would 
have resulted finally in emancipation, if the North 
had only consented to keep still and leave the matter 
exclusively to the states in which the system existed. 
But to assume the possibility of such a development 
from slavery to freedom is to assume conditions 
which simply did not exist. With human passions 
what they are, the time when a peaceful path to 
emancipation was still open had passed years before 
Garrison founded "The Liberator " and organized the 
New Abolitionists in 1831. And upon no one man 
of earlier date, any more than upon Garrison, can 
the whole of the burden be placed. Another study 
of the anti-slavery conflict, though from a different 
point of view, is " The Battle of Principles " ( Revell) , 
by Dr. Newell Dwight Hillis, of the Plymouth 
Church in Brooklyn. " Our national peril is Mam- 
monism, and the sordid pursuit of gold," says the 
author. " Our fathers came hither in pursuit of God 
and liberty, not gold and territory." To draw 
the attention of our youth to the fundamental prin- 
ciples of freedom and right, then, is the duty of the 
hour; and to this end he describes the struggle for 
the abolition of slavery, grouping his facts and ideas 
mostly about prominent characters in the conflict, 
such as Webster and Calhoun, Garrison, Phillips, 
Sumner, Greeley, Mrs. Stowe, John Brown, Lincoln, 
Douglas, and Beecher. The person who has read 
much in this field will find little that is new in Dr. 
Hillis's volume; but the story is told in attractive 
form, and will perhaps carry its lesson to many who 
will not take time for the more extensive reading 
from which those of us who are older gathered it.

golden-haired "John Bullesses," and he bubbles 
over, in the oddest, most amusing, most picturesquely 
expressive idiom, in praise of her charms. Viewing 
her at a new angle and with far-eastern preposses- 
sions, he startles and delights the reader with many 
fresh and highly original and sometimes salutary 
comments on her character and ways. Here is a

them could love me. It was some years ago when 
the last one told me it was impossible for her to love 
me. I wrote in my diary thus : ' Alas, have I for- 
gotten myself again ? I was born as an artist and to 
love the beauties. Therefore I am permitted to walk 
into this flower garden. How charming are those 
flowers! They are blossoming beautifully for me to 
try my brush, but not for me to pick up.'" It is not 
surprising to find the author championing the cause 
of the " suffragettes " in a chapter devoted to them. 
Other chapters deal with the English woman's home 
life, with her amusements and her social life, with 
her services to him as teacher, with "broad-minded 
John Bullesses," with the conditions that best bring 
out the beauty and the liveliness of English women, 
and so on. The colored pictures are worthy of the 
gifted artist, and are well reproduced; and the draw- 
ings are suggestive and amusing sometimes unusu- 
ally spirited and graceful. 

In his sumptuous volume on "John 
Lavery and his Work" (Estes) Mr. 
portrait painter. Walter Shaw-Sparrow explains that, 
as in his similar work on Frank Brangwyn one of 
last year's most attractive and excellent of artist biog- 
raphies "an appeal is made to those who believe 
that every generation ought to protect its own good 
genius. Reverence for the Old Masters has dangers 
of its own ; if carried too far, it hinders current effort 
by nourishing an excessive awe of tradition and au- 
thority." Mr. Lavery, still in the vigor of his best 
years, has won such repute as a portrait-painter that 
the King and Queen of England have commissioned 
him to paint their portraits, and he is one of the 
comparatively few artists who have been invited to 
present their own likenesses, the product of their 
own skill, to the Uffizi Gallery. The story of young 
Lavery's straggles with adversity and rise to pros- 
perity by the way of a Glasgow photographer's 
studio, where he tinted photographs, a Paris art- 
school, where he had to unlearn much that he had 
already acquired, and sketching travels through 
various foreign countries makes good reading as 
narrated by his always-sympathetic biographer. It 
is, of course, these formative years that are most 
important in tracing the development of genius or 
character, of whatever sort; and Mr. Shaw-Sparrow 
takes pains to remind his readers, in so many words, 
that he is "studying a painter's career as it ought 
to be studied in a book, from within the changing 
atmosphere of its early years, which are always the 



The rite of a 
noted Iriih 



most important years in the making of an arti-t. 
In his occasional pregnant utterances on Mr. Lavery's 
points of strength and weaknev, not a few are of 
larger application, a-. It is impossible to be great 
in portraiture if you plod to excel yourself, because 
greatness comes unbidden and out of the dark, like 
the dawn." Mr. Lavery, it should be remembered, 
is an Irishman by birth, "and he and his work prosper 
in an Irish manner as emigrants." Twelve color 
plates, five " Rembrandtgravures," and twenty collo- 
types do their best to give the reader some notion 
of this artist's leading characteristics; and twenty- 
two pages of preface, personal and reminiscent, are 
contributed by Mr. R. B. Cunninghame Graham. 



American readers who are interested 
Quern Victoria'* j n tne eve ry.day life of court and 
earlv life. . ... , J . J . , 

castle will derive much pleasure and 

information from Clare Jerrold's "The Early Court 
of Queen Victoria" (Putnam). It is the author's 
purpose "to show the young monarch as she really 
was, surrounded by the somewhat cruel limitations 
of her time a girl frank, loving, truthful, and ad- 
mirable in many ways, yet one in whom the seeds of 
an undue pride had been planted and most earnestly 
fostered by those responsible," though on the whole 
a very lovable person. As such a work must neces- 
sarily deal largely with influences within the family, 
considerable attention is given to Victoria's relatives, 
the children and grandchildren of George III. It is 
not possible to write of these scions of royalty with- 
out telling unpleasing tales ; but as far as possible the 
author avoids all forms of scandal. The extraordi- 
nary care that the Duchess of Kent showed in bring- 
ing up the future Queen, and which has been praised 
so highly by uncritical writers, is shown in a new 
light: the author has little sympathy for such mater- 
nal care as allows no opportunity for unaided growth. 
" From the day of her birth to her accession she 
[Victoria] had scarcely been alone for ten minutes 
at a time!" Some account is also given of the polit- 
ical influences that controlled the earlier years of the 
reign. The work closes with the Queen's marriage ; 
the concluding chapter deals with Queen Victoria's 
home and the difficulties encountered in organizing 
the new establishment and in the efforts to free it 
from annoying interferences. The work is provided 
with a number of excellent contemporary portraits, 
including two of the young Queen. While much of 
the material included is of slight importance, the vol- 
ume shows careful and judicious research, and makes 
an acceptable addition to the growing literature about 
the great Queen. _

whether such a comprehensive subject can be treated 
satisfactorily within the limits prescribed by the plan 
of the series. Frankly, we remain rather doubtful: 
we cannot quite escape the impression that might 
arise from seeing an elephant driven to a trotting 
sulky. But we must hasten to add that the book 
seems as good as it can be under the conditions. In 
fact, it is the best small treatise we know dealing with 
the range of subjects fairly indicated by the general 
title; and on that ground it can be cordially recom- 
mended. The ten chapters, bearing such captions 
as "The People," "The Caste System," "Economic 
Life," "The Native States," etc., are concise and 
trustworthy presentations in simple form of their 
respective themes. One must regret that the appear- 
ance of the volume did not happen to be postponed 
until after the surprising announcements at the 
Delhi durbar, even if these did not involve any 
radical change in policy except with reference to the 
capital and the partition of Bengal. However, the 
reader will easily fit these new details to the general 
idea that he will have gathered from the author's 
presentation. There are some indications that the 
author's "copy " was turned off at rather high speed, 
although on the whole one reads along pleasurably 
enough. The bibliography is up to the laudable 
standard set for the series; but it is impossible to 
acquiesce in the omission of a map from such a 
volume, which is expressly intended for a public 
without special knowledge of India. Even those of 
us who feel fairly familiar with the geography of 
that " gigantic triangle " would not be ungrateful for 
such simple aid, while for others it would seem in- 
dispensable. 

New source Mr. James Alexander Robertson's 

material in , % ,, T . . j 

American two- volume work, "Louisiana under 

history. the Rule of Spain, France, and the 

United States, 1785-1807" (A. H. Clark Co.), 
contains five hundred pages of original unpublished 
documents bearing on the twenty-five years of turbu- 
lent history of the lower Mississippi region following 
the close of the American Revolution. It contains, 
also, an abundance of explanatory notes and a good 
index. The work was worth doing, and it has been 
done well by both the author and the publishers. 
The most valuable of these documents is the long 
epistolary account of conditions in Louisiana written 
by Paul Alliot after his expulsion from New Orleans 
in March, 1803. Alliot was a physician, a keen ob- 
server, and (if his own story be allowed in evidence) 
an able man with statesmanlike views. His narrative 
treats of all phases of Louisiana life and conditions, 
and it is rightly given the place of honor in these 
volumes. The publication of the original French 
text on alternate pages with a good English transla- 
tion is to be commended, while the notes bearing 
upon this document give valuable information about 
the city of New Orleans, the various industries of the 
territory at the time of its purchase by the United 
States, and the social and intellectual life. In the 
second volume there are letters of the English, 



French, Spanish, and American agents to their gov- 
ernments, covering the period of 1785 to 1803 very 
closely; and, after the American occupation, the 
correspondence between such men as Claiborne and 
Wilkinson sheds much new light on the problems of 
the West to the time of the Aaron Burr Conspiracy. 
One of the most interesting of the papers of these later 
years is that of Vicente Folch, Governor of Florida, 
dated 1804 (?), describing the marvellous changes 
in the Mississippi valley after the penetration of the 
Americans into that region about the middle of the 
eighteenth century. The settlement of Kentucky 
by the Virginians was the beginning of great things 
in the West, according to Folch. The sources of the 
documents contained in these volumes are the Span- 
ish, French, and Cuban archives, and the collections 
in Washington, New Orleans, and other cities of 
the United States. With the constant appearance of 
such works as this, the history of the United States 
promises soon to be so well "documented" that the 
role of the historian is likely to become most unen- 
viable. 



New light on 
Lafcadio Hearn. 



A contributor to a recent issue of 
THE DIAL referred to Mrs. Nina H. 
Kennard's book on Lafcadio Hearn 
( Appleton) as " in many ways the most comprehen- 
sive " account of that master of English prose. The 
book is an excellent one in its way, though it would 
have gained much by more systematic planning and 
more efficient condensation. Its faults, apart from 
those just suggested, are on the surface, notably 
carelessness in proofreading (which is responsible for 
numerous slips of no great inherent consequence), 
and a want of distinction in style. Mrs. Kennard has 
appreciation for the subject of her biography, though 
she is not critic enough adequately to trace the evolu- 
tion of a great stylist out of one who had, as she her- 
self has written, his "orchid and cockatoo" phase. 
Incidentally, she scarcely does justice to his earlier 
work, denying as she does any artistic merit to 
"Chita" one of the overloaded, albeit brief, ro- 
mances of his New Orleans period. Mrs. Kennard's 
book supplements what Mrs. Wetmore and other 
Americans have told us of Hearn's life, and succeeds 
in establishing the falsity of some of the Hearn 
"legend." The new biographer has the advantage 
of knowing Hearn's Irish kin, and of having read 
his letters to Mrs. Atkinson, his half-sister. Portions 
of this correspondence are, indeed, introduced. The 
reader of Mrs. Kennard's memoir will learn more of 
Hearn's early life in Ireland, and at school with the 
Jesuit fathers in England, than he could previously 
have known. Who, for instance, was aware until now 
that Hearn's brother is still living, and in America?

makes its appeal to the reader, and gives opportunity 
for the interpretative skill of the writer. An unusu- 
ally successful example of this sort of work is Profes- 
sor Ladd's "Elements of Physiological Psychology " 
(Scribner) as now very substantially rewritten and 
revised by Professor Wood worth. The proportion 
of parts, the data, the expositions are all so decidedly 
altered as to constitute a new book, as indeed it must 
be to be useful. One may even question whether 
the revision could not have gone still further to ad- 
vantage. Considerable space is given to the descrip- 
tion of the structure and functions of the nervous 
system ; it is important that this should be available 
in the new formulation for students of psychology, 
and the task is here most ably accomplished. Chap- 
ter by chapter the new is skilfully incorporated with 
the old, only occasionally revealing the seams too 
conspicuously. Upon its general merits the book at 
once assumes a commandingly useful place for the 
student or reader who is serious in his purpose to 
survey the available data of psychology. 



Or f0 on in the Oregon sixty-one years ago, 

mnkinii. >-v one and living there all his life, ac- 
the maker,. qaa i nt ed with all parts of the Beaver 
State by reason of his many campaigns of public 
speaking and electioneering, mingling freely and 
genially with his fellow-Oregonians of every calling 
and degree, and holding for four years the governor- 
ship of the State after a considerable experience in 
political office of a less exalted nature, ex-Governor 
Geer is in a position to discourse most entertainingly 
on the history and growth of that part of the great 
Northwest which has been his lifelong home and 
the scene of his various activities. ''Fifty Years 
in Oregon" (Neale) is a substantial volume, rich 
in personal reminiscence, local history, illustrative 
anecdote, and the vicissitudes of politics. The 
decendant of a line of farmers from Connecticut by 
way of Ohio and Illinois, and himself a farmer until 
public life diverted his energies in other directions, 
Mr. Geer is master of a style marked by homely 
directness and the employment of figures and illu>- 
trations sure to be understood and enjoyed by those 
to whom his book will most strongly appeal. Four 
years of his later life have been given to the editor- 
ship of a newspaper, the Pendleton " Daily Tribune," 
so that he brings to his book-writing the literary 
skill acquired in journalism. Some striking views 
of Oregon scenery and a frontispiece portrait of the 
author embellish the volume. 



BRIEFER MENTION. . 

" Who's Who in America " (Marquis) for 1912-13 
has just been published, and the volume is the seventh 
biennial issue of that indispensable work of reference. 
Despite the many gaps caused by death, and the system 
which for many biographies refers readers to the 
previously-published volumes of the series, the work 
expands rather portentously. Thin paper and clone 
economy of space in the typography keep the bulk 



down to something like the old dimensions, although 
nearly 19,000 biographies are now given, and tln-M- 
are nearly 2,700 pages in the book. The useful Geo- 
graphical Index is retained. 

"The Ben Greet Shakespeare for Young Readers and 
Amateur Players" (Doubleday) is a presentation of tin- 
plays in a form suitable for the amateur stage, with dia- 
grams and minute directions both for tin- biiMin -ss " 
and the understanding of the text. It is an admirable 
undertaking, and should find a hearty welcome. The 
volumes now published are "The Merchant of Venice," 
" As You Like It," " A Midsummer Night's Dream," 
and " The Tempest." 

The Eighth Annual Report of the Virginia State Li- 
brary is an unusually full and interesting volume, run- 
ning indeed to more than five hundred pages, the greater 
part of which is occupied with a " List of the Revolu- 
tionary Soldiers of Virginia" a partial list, necessarily, 
but much nearer completeness than any previous one. 
It is sadly significant to note, among the serious diffi- 
culties encountered by the compiler (Mr. H. .1. Kcken- 
rode, Archivist), the incomprehensible refusal of the 
War Department at Washington, or of its archivist, to 
permit the copying of its rolls. But Mr. Eckenrode has 
succeeded in obtaining the names of between thirty-five 
and thirty-six thousand Virginia soldiers of our War of 
Independence. 

Most of the ambitious books dealing with India nat- 
urally omit details about " native building, occupations, 
mode of farming, daily life, productions, methods of 
mission work, obstacles, and so forth." Yet these are 
just the things an average American might ask a friend 
to write about in his letters from that picturesque pen- 
insula, and they form the subject matter of a little vol- 
ume entitled "India and Daily Life in Bengal," from 
the pen of the Reverend Z. F. Griffin, and issued by the 
American Baptist Publication Society. The work is un- 
pretentious, and is written with no concern about style; 
but, if it may be judged by its own standard, it really 
deserves the success indicated by the appearance of the 
third edition, for the author amply fulfills the modest 
promises made in the preface. Mr. Griftin does not for- 
get that he has been a missionary for fifteen years; but 
he does not obtrude this interest unduly. The text is 
vivified by thirty-eight illustrations, "mostly from the 
author's own negatives." 

Ohio occcupied an important and influential position 
duriug the critical period of the Civil War, and as a 
result a large amount of writing on the various questions 
connecting the history of the state with the momentous 
epoch has accumulated from year to year. " The (.'nil 
War Literature of Ohio: A Bibliography with Explan- 
atory and Historical Notes" (Cleveland: Burrows 
Brothers Co.), compiled by Mr. Daniel J. Ryan, now 
makes this mass of literature available to librarians and 
students of history. The material here described 
represents all types of writing on the subject, from < )l1i- 
cial Documents and records of Army organizations to 
miscellaneous works, including fiction, poetry, letters, 
etc. All is arranged alphabetically by author, and, 
following the annotation of the book or article i which is 
frequently extended to a digest that pains in significance 
when the item described represents a piece of work \\\\ 
out of print) is a brief summary of the author's life. 
The analytical index is serviceable. In scope, as u.-ll 
as in conciseness, this pioneer work might well serve a* 
a model for other states that may have a similar task 
to perform.

"Some English Story-Tellers " is the title of a volume 
devoted to the younger English novelists, written by 
Mr. Frederick Taber Cooper, which Messrs. Henry 
Holt & Co. will publish in the autumn. 

" The Home Book of Verse," compiled by Mr. Burton 
E. Stevenson, which Messrs. Holt have long had in active 
preparation, is likely to appear early in the coming au- 
tumn. It will be an octavo volume of about four thoii- 
sand pages, reduced to manageable proportions by the 
use of India paper. 

"The American Occupation of the Philippines," by 
Mr. James H. Blount, Officer U. S. Volunteers in the 
Philippines, 1899-1901, U. S. District Judge in the 
Philippines, 1901-1905, will be issued this month by 
Messrs. Putnam. The book is said to be a well-reasoned 
argument for native self-government. 

Mary Caroline Crawford, author of " Old Boston Days 
and Ways " and " Romantic Days in Old Boston," is at 
work on a book of wider scope for autumn. It will be 
called " Romantic Days in the Early Republic," and will 
deal with New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washing- 
ton, Richmond, and other Southern cities. 

Mr. Oscar Browning's latest work, " The History of 
the Modern World," will be published immediately by 
Messrs. Cassell. In the two volumes of which the new 
work consists, Professor Browning will give us a survey 
of the political events of the last ninety-five years, more 
than seventy of which have been passed during the 
writer's lifetime. 

Margaret E. Sangster, a well-known magazine writer 
and editor, died on the 4th of this month. She was 
born in 1838. Besides producing a large amount of 
original verse, fiction, etc. (largely for younger readers), 
Mrs. Sangster was for ten years editor of " Harper's 
Bazar," and has held editorial connections with half 
a dozen other periodicals. 

In connection with the recataloguing and reclassifi- 
cation of its collections the University of Chicago Li- 
braries expect at an early date to begin printing on 
cards a considerable number of titles for which no 
printed cards can be obtained from the Library of 
Congress or the John Crerar Library. The entries will 
conform to the Library of Congress rules, author as well 
as subject, and will include subject and other added en- 



tries as well as the classification numbers, according to 
the Library of Congress system It is not yet known 
to what extent it will be possible to place these cards at 
the disposal of other libraries. In order to learn what 
demand there may be for them it is proposed to try the 
plan based on that recently adopted by Harvard College 
Library, whereby complete sets of all cards printed will 
be supplied at a nominal subscription price; or, where 
individual cards are desired, dated proofsheets will be 
supplied as rapidly as the type is set, and orders for 
separate cards may be entered for a period of thirty 
days after the date of each proofsheet. Full informa- 
tion as to prices, etc., may be obtained from the Director 
of the Libraries, University of Chicago.
