OVER THE TOP 

By ARTHUR GUY EMPEY 

An American Soldier who went 

The New York Tribune says: 

"For the very spirit of the strife, and all the unspeakable and unimaginable lp : ana 
fear, horror and exaltation, of the struggle for life and death, no book that has writ- 
ten in this war, if indeed in any war, surpasses this simple and unpretentious * an 
American soldier boy who himself went "over the top" and "gave them hell." 

He has an irrepressible sense of humor, and humor there is in even some of n- 

mest scenes of war; and he has a sense of pathos and of tragedy as well. "Torrii ic- 

tionary of the Trenches" which concludes the volume, is an anthology of mingled and 
wisdom. Perhaps, after all, we should not call this a book about the war: It is a hot, 
throbbing, vital section of the war itself. 



Erapey was 
wounded seven 
times lived for a 
year and a half 
with mud, rats and 
shells went "over

et-charges 
through gas a t-

tangled in barbed 
wire, with machine 
guns working a 
few yards away 
and lay for 36 
hours, wounded 
and unconscious, in 
"No Man's Land."

The War and the Labor Programme 



Between March, 1913 and June, 1916 
two hundred and ninety-six industrial dis- 
putes are recorded as having taken place. 
Between June 30, 1916 and May 30, 
1917, in the course of eleven months cur- 
rent, there have been two hundred and 
forty-four such disputes. To dispose of 
them, the Department of Labor had here- 
tofore employed a body of conciliators, 
twenty-one in number. Of these, seven- 
teen have recently been dismissed, because 
the Congressional Committee on Appro- 
priations, of which Fitzgerald of Tam- 
many is chairman, refused to report any 
appropriation for the service of media- 
tion and conciliation in labor disputes for 
the coming fiscal year, beyond the sum 
necessary to maintain the skeleton of an 
organization. Meanwhile federal soldiers 
were used in Newark against pickets of a 
branch of the International Molders 
Union there on strike, and were called off 
through the intervention of a civilian ad- 
visor to the Secretary of War. 

These data are significant. Take them 
together with the astounding assault on 
the social and labor legislation of the 
state of New York, with the remarkable 
declaration of surrender of the indispen- 
sable right of labor to strike attributed to 
Mr. Gompers, and they have an implica- 
tion, patriotic or noble or self-sacrificing 
as their original intention may have been, 
sinister in the extreme for their ultimate 
result. 

We are in a war, we have been told 
again and again, which is to "make the 
world safe for democracy." In numbers 
and in technique it is an unprecedented 
war; and in the fact, so often repeated 
and underscored, that it is a war to be 
won on the fields and in the factories at 
home far more than in the trenches 
abroad, it is a unique war. This means 
that upon the workingman falls the re- 
sponsibility of losing or winning this war 
for our country. Consequently the atti- 



tude of the government and of employers 
toward labor and its needs and desires be- 
comes of even greater moment than the 
government's attitude toward the constitu- 
tional rights of freedom of speech and 
conscience and person. 

Now, that governmental interference in 
labor disputes should be necessary may 
be natural, but it is not desirable and it 
is not inevitable, and where enlightenment 
and intelligence exist among employers, it 
does not occur, because the situations that 
require it do not arise. However one 
may think of the class-war, labor and capi- 
tal have certain common interests which 
in the long run are more fundamental 
than their antagonisms. Modernism in 
industry has meant the relatively rapid 
realization of this community by some en- 
trepeneurs and the relatively slow realiza- 
tion of it by the forces of labor. The 
common interest is the end for which an 
industry exists the production of a work 
of a certain type and character. Every- 
thing else in the organization of a produc- 
tive agency is secondary to that; mere 
means. The administrative, the financial, 
the distributive and other concerns of an 
industrial organization are means, and 
means only. Effectively to employ this 
means, however, requires human personal- 
ity. And the human units of an industrial 
organization can be human only in so far 
as they find in their work opportunity for 
the free play of their spontaneous ener- 
gies, their initiative, their creative imagi- 
nation, their intelligence only in so far, 
in a word, as their work is itself not to be 
regarded as a means, but as an end, not 
labor but art. If the laboring classes have 
been slow in realizing the community of 
themselves with the employing classes, it 
is because the latter have dealt with them 
in impersonal, non-human terms, have 
treated them as means, as "hands," as 
"operatives" instead of human beings. 
Denied acknowledgment of the partner-

ship which exists in fact between all the 
human units engaged in an industry, the la- 
borer has accepted perforce the status im- 
posed upon him the status of earner, as 
against that of craftsman and creator, and 
has taken his work as the necessary evil 
involved in earning a living, a thing quite 
apart from the making of a life. He 
has accepted the uncertainties of the 
future the dangers of unemployment, of 
ill-health, of penniless old-age and death, 
and has followed blindly the uncontrolled 
operation of what the economic pundits 
miscall "the law of supply and demand." 
His attitude toward the employing classes 
has sprung inevitably out of his accept- 
ance of this unnecessary situation as neces- 
sary. Similarly, the tool-possessing em- 
ployers, dealing with labor as a commod- 
ity to be bought and sold in open mar- 
ket, became and largely remain, inimical to 
labor-force and hence to themselves. Only 
in recent years have they discovered that 
the acknowledgment of the de facto part- 
nership with labor, the spread and intensi- 
fication of the consciousness of it, the 
recognition and encouragement of the hu- 
manity of the laborer, the provision of op- 
portunity for the exercise of his creative 
energies, the establishment for him of a 
proprietary interest in the works and the 
abolition of his fundamental uncertainties 
concerning the future, not only avert dis- 
putes, but improve the output, increase 
profits and turn a slave-gang into a team. 
As the experience of the Ford and other 
industrial companies shows, the saving in 
money and quality of work that comes 
from the elimination, by this means, of the 
mobility and restlessness of labor is enough 
to pay the added costs over and over 
again. In a word, to make the partner- 
ship of labor with capital conscious and 
conspicuous in the organization of indus- 
try is not to venture on untried ground; 
it is to make general a form of organiza- 
tion which in numerous observable in- 
stances has shown itself to be not merely 
common decency but good business and 
genuine democracy. They have demon- 
strated the actual harmonization of democ- 
racy with efficiency which the conditions 
of warfare have made so central a prob- 
lem among nations with free institutions. 



It is the duty of an intelligent patriotism 
to extend this condition to all fields of in- 
dustrial endeavor where disputes are 
likely to arise. It is the duty or labor. It 
is the duty of capital. It is the duty of the 
government, which represents the common 
interests of both and has become the ar- 
biter of their differences. Capital, so far 
as it has spoken, has, however, shown it- 
self blind and greedy; labor, so far as it 
has spoken, has shown itself flabby and 
sentimental, and the government as un- 
intelligent as usual. Responsibility falls 
therefore upon the more far-sighted lead- 
ers in the labor organizations, upon the 
wise entrepreneurs who have already 
achieved something in industry in the di- 
rection of efficient democracy, and upon 
intelligent public opinion, whose hands 
more than any other, can mold the world 
into the form "safe for democracy." 

The foundation upon which rests "de- 
mocracy efficient" is a proposition which 
President Wilson has recently given wider 
publicity than it has had in a thousand 
years. It is the proposition that labor is 
not a commodity. Labor is not a thing 
that can be detached from a man and sent 
out into the market to be bought and sold 
like coal or iron or flour or books or guns. 
Men sell themselves in selling their labor. 
And it is hence that the rights of labor 
can never be separated from the rights 
of man, while the rights of property not 
only can, but must. The right to strike, 
it follows clearly, is not a right involving 
property; it is a right involving person. 
So is the principle of unionism, which 
alone can make the right to strike opera- 
tive. It is the use of both these rights by 
labor which has won the grudging recog- 
nition of the humanity of labor-force, and 
a surrender or mitigation of them is sui- 
cide. 

The proposition that labor is not a 
commodity implies that there is an irre- 
ducible minimum below which wages 
may not under any circumstances go, a 
minimum not determined by "the law of 
supply and demand," but by the effective 
needs of a human being for health, spon- 
taneous action, and assurance concerning 
the future. In war time, particularly. 
when the will and the power of the hu-

man organism is at a maximum tension, the 
minimum necessary to repair waste, to 
store up the required physiological surplus, 
to keep up the condition of health and vi- 
tality of interest is indispensable in all 
forms of employment. This minimum 
should be set by the standard of living ex- 
isting in a given society and by such modifi- 
cations as a scientific consideration of the 
physiological and psychological conditions 
of good health and efficacious working 
would make. No production of any sort 
can begin to be anything but murder, slow 
or rapid, which involves the employment 
of labor below such a necessary minimum. 
The minimum wage of labor, in a word, 
should be a standard item among the fixed 
charges for the upkeep and repair of the 
industrial plant. The fixed charges of the 
non-human part of the plant are on the 
whole irreducible, and the care and up- 
keep of the human part under anything 
like human conditions should be even more 
irreducible. . 

In fact the minimum wage should not 
be regarded as a' wage at all. It relates 
to that part of a workman's life that is 
subhuman, its animal foundation, not the 
creative impulses which are the nobler 
part of him. Wages proper should begin 
to be counted at the point where these im- 
pulses come into action and should be 
based upon his personal excellence and 
initiative. That is, the most significant 
form in which they could come is that of a 
share in the profits proportionate to the 
workman's distinction as a workman. All 
net profit over four per cent should be 
divided in proper ratio between employers 
and employees. The form that such divi- 
sion might take is various enough. Some 
of it had best take, if experience is any 
guide, the form of safeguarding the future 
against disease, old age, and death. In 
this form, as an insurance, it abolishes, on 
the whole, the problems of changing 
employees for the entrepreneur and unem- 
ployment for the laborer. The partner- 
ship of the two becomes explicit, and ex- 
plicit partnership requires frankness and 
trust. Labor must know the status and 
problems of the concern of which it is a 
part, and must have a voice, if only an 
advisory one, in the conduct of its affairs. 



It should, that is, be represented on the 
directorate, and should be informed and 
consulted with regarding fundamental 
changes in the concern's affairs. The more 
permanently to establish the human unity 
of the industry, moreover, the workers 
within it should have the opportunity, if 
not the obligation, of progressively acquir- 
ing shares of its stock. They become thus 
in the completest sense owners as well as 
workers; their interest and the interest of 
the whole enterprise become explicitly, as 
they had been potentially, identical, and 
even the most routine and terrible of the 
mechanical and reflex repetitions of a 
process in which so much of our industrial 
endeavor consists, are thrown into an or- 
ganic whole, fitted into a proper perspec- 
tive, which eliminates the spiritual 
isolation of the workman from his tasks, 
thus conserving his humanity and increas- 
ing his efficiency. The industry becomes 
in this way progressively cooperative. It 
acquires esprit de corps, is at once dem- 
ocratic and efficient. 

A perspective based upon practical par- 
ticipation in the ownership and operation 
of a works tends, however, itself to be- 
come mechanized and habitual. The 
sense of unity and esprit de corps it creates 
tends to get deadened over a long stretch 
of time. To maintain it requires, on the 
part of workman as well as of adminis- 
trator, an intelligent understanding of the 
problems and processes of the industry 
and its general bearing on the life of the 
nation. Such an understanding can be 
created only through education, and for 
this reason an indispensable adjunct to a 
democratically coordinated industry is a 
system of education which shall be com- 
pulsory for all people in the shops under 
twenty-five years of age, and optional for 
those over twenty-five. The curriculum 
would vary to some extent with the in- 
dustry, but on the whole, it would be 
standard. An important part of it would 
naturally take the form of numerous in- 
formal conferences between the various 
grades of craftsmen in the industry, on 
their own work and the relation of dif- 
ferent departments to one another. It 
would be easy, but undesirable, to elabor- 
ate details of a satisfactory educational

system. For present purposes it is enough 
to indicate that such a system is indispen- 
sable, if merely from the fact that men 
more and more are concerned with the 
handling of complicated machinery that 
must be understood if it is to be kept right. 
In sum, here is, in principle at least, 
a fundamental way, a tested and practical 
way to make the nation safe for democ- 
racy. We do not need to surrender the 
spirit of free institutions to win this war: 



we do not need to Prussiani/e our coun- 
try in order to defeat Prussianism. We 
need only substitute vision for greed and 
intelligence for habit-custom. We need 
only take example from what has already 
been accomplished in this country and take 
courage to extend it. 

But shall we? It is for labor to de- 
mand and for capital to offer. The alter- 
native is the disastrous experience of Eng- 
land. H. M. K.M.I.KN. 



Thoreau and "The Wild" 



What differentiates Thoreau from Eu- 
ropean writers on nature is, primarily, his 
intense Puritanism; what differentiates 
him from other American writers Bry- 
ant, Lowell, Emerson, and the rest, most 
of whom share his Puritanism is, pri- 
marily, his ardent yearning for wildness. 

"There is in my nature, methinks, a 
singular yearning toward all wildness," he 
wrote in his first book. Later he prepared 
a lecture on "Walking, or the Wild," and 
indeed in all of his characteristic work we 
find what might be termed his doctrine of 
the Wild. "At the same time that we 
are earnest to explore and learn all 
things," he writes, "we require that all 
things be mysterious and unexplorable, 
that land and sea be infinitely wild." Close 
about us lies the friendly world of nature, 
but whenever we make our way into it, 
suddenly it grows strange and wild, the 
explored becomes unexplorable, and we 
are aware of contact with a life "pastur- 
ing freely where we never wander." That 
is the Wild. If we were only alive enough, 
we should be able to enter upon that 
larger, freer existence which the Wild 
leads: "The most alive is the wildest." 

The Wild, then, is living Nature, the 
inscrutable personality that animates the 
flux, resembling in some respects the elan 
vital of our day, yet really very different 
because static. Not a systematic specula- 
tive thinker, Thoreau seems to have had 
a somewhat odd notion that the physical 
world is inhabited by a personality with 
(perhaps) a spiritual universe of its own, 
while we, inhabiting the same physical 



world, have (perhaps) a different (and 
higher) spiritual universe. Sometimes he 
would breathe the humane air of his 
proper spiritual order; sometimes, more 
rarely, the wilder air of the spiritual or- 
der of nature. When the latter impulse 
dominated him, it seemed to him that at- 
tainment meant no less than some kind of 
actual union, or transfusion, with nature. 
He would "eat the brown earth." On 
another day he records a curiously gross- 
spiritual emotion; he "worships," he says, 
the brownish light in the sod on certain 
wet days in March, feels as if he "could 
eat the very crust of the earth; I never 
felt so terrene, never sympathized so with 
the surface of the earth." Later in the 
same month he could "stroke and kiss the 
very sward, it is so fair." Again, he tells 
a correspondent that he grows "savager 
and savager every day, as if fed on raw 
meat." That raw meat had its powerful 
charms is indicated by the passage in 
"Walden" in which he tells how, one even- 
ing as he was returning to the hut, chanc- 
ing to see a woodchuck steal across his 
path in the gathering darkness, he "felt 
a strange thrill of savage delight, and was 
strongly tempted to seize and devour him 
raw." On one or two occasions while he 
lived at the pond, he goes on to confess, 
he found himself wandering through the 
woods "like a half-starved hound, with a 
strange abandonment, seeking some kind 
of venison which I might devour, and no 
morsel could have been too savage 
for me." The whole chapter, indeed 
("Higher Laws"), is a study of the dual 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



life he was impelled to lead, one rank and 
savage, the other spiritual, or to use his 
own terms, one wild, the other human. 

Thoreau's lust (hardly too strong a 
word) for rainstorms and swamps is one 
of the most conspicuous instances of his 
yearning for wildness. He would like to 
sit in a distant cave throughout "a three- 
weeks' storm, cold and wet," to give a 
tone to his system. Better still a swamp; 
to have your house abut on a forbidding 
swamp is to dwell next to Elysium. Al- 
though for some reason he failed to select 
so advantageous a site for his woodland 
cabin, he visited the swamps of his parish 
with assiduous frequency, and entered into 
their life, in a double sense, with the keen- 
est sympathy. Sometimes, as if to be 
civilized, he aims, ostensibly, to go a-cran- 
berrying, or to find the kalmia, though 
what he always relishes is not the cran- 
berries or the kalmia, but the "cold and 
bracing" wading in the stagnant water and 
muck, "amid the water andromeda and 
the sphagnum, scratching my legs with the 
first and sinking deep in the last. The 
water is now gratefully cool to my legs, 
so far from being poisoned in the strong 
waters of the swamp. It is a sort of bap- 
tism for which I had waited." Superior, 
however, to merely wading would be the 
luxury of standing "up to one's chin in 
some retired swamp for a whole summer's 
day, scenting the sweet-fern and bilberry 
blows, and lulled by the minstrelsy of 
gnats and mosquitoes. A day passed in 
the society of those Greek sages, such as 
described in the 'Banquet' of Xenophon 
would not be comparable with the dry 
wit of cranberry vines, and the fresh At- 
tic salt of the moss beds. Say twelve hours 
of genial and familiar intercourse with 
the leopard frog." 

This emotional attachment has its in- 
tellectual counterpart in that doctrine of 
the Wild which he preached in season and 
out of season. Briefly stated, it is this: 
that all civilization refers back to primi- 
tive nature, derives thence its title to per- 
manence^ and ever and anon deliberately 
reunites itself with its source of vitality. 
If it does not, it is a moribund civilization. 
Thus, in the fable of Romulus and Re- 
mus, Thoreau reads the eternal truth that 



every state that has attained eminence has 
drawn nourishment and vigor from alma 
natura. The children of the Roman Em- 
pire, not being suckled by wolves, gave 
place to the northern barbarians who 
were. The continent of America is the 
she-wolf of our time, he goes on to say, 
and the children of the diseased civiliza- 
tion of Europe, responding to her coarse 
ministrations, are reinvigorated, are en- 
abled to found here a new Rome. In time 
this Rome of the West will likewise lan- 
guish, if the rank soil that sustains it is 
allowed to become exhausted; it can be 
maintained only by ever-recurrent reliance 
on the Wild. "Surely good courage will 
not flag here on the Atlantic border, as 
long as we are flanked by the Fur Coun- 
tries. There is enough in that sound to 
cheer one under any circumstances. The 
spruce, the hemlock, and the pine will not 
countenance despair." 

Never was there a more convinced be- 
liever in the essential goodness of nature. 
Her rectitude is attested, he asserts, by the 
uprightness of trees; and "Disease and a 
rain-drop cannot coexist." In her large 
equanimity and antiseptic purity, she is 
medicine for body and soul, and no dis- 
ease is beyond her magical healing power. 
"They bury poisoned sheep up to the necks 
in earth to take the poison out of them." 
She is completely healthy and innocent, 
and is an ideal to guide ever erring hu- 
manity. One might regard Thoreau, on 
a hasty examination, as accepting the 
charming myth of a nature of the Golden 
Age, smiling, tender, artless, not the slimy, 
hoary, shagged beast of a nature of pre- 
historic periods. But actually he had the 
modern vision of nature as red in tooth 
and claw. There is a tragedy, he said, at 
the end of the life of every wild creature. 
His "innocent" nature is fond of violence, 
fond of what a superficial view holds re- 
pulsive that is one aspect of her inno- 
cence. "We are cheered," he wrote in a 
significant passage in "Walden," "when 
we observe the vulture feeding on the car- 
rion which disgusts and disheartens us, 
and deriving health and strength from the 
repast. . . I love to see that Nature 
is so rife with life that myriads can be af- 
forded to be sacrificed and suffered to

prey on one another; that tender organi- 
zations can be so serenely squashed out of 
existence like pulp, tadpoles which her- 
ons gobble up, and tortoises and toads 
run over in the road; and that sometimes 
it has rained flesh and blood! 
The impression made on a wise man is 
that of universal innocence." Thoreau's 
outlook on nature, indeed, does not suf- 
fer from a trace of Transcendental 
anaemia. He looks the facts in the eye, 
even the ugliest, sees the struggle for ex- 
istence no less than the inspiriting sunset, 
and gives us, in the end, something like a 
whole view. That view was, of course, 
predestined to be favorable. Even so 
dread a word as Necessity he stripped of 
its terrors by regarding it as "only an- 
other name for inflexibility of good." 
Nature was bound to be good. No aspect 
of nature's wildness could repel him. 

Everywhere he looked for the Wild. 
"In literature," he asserted, "it is only the 
wild that attracts us," though here the 
term means little more than spontaneity, 
the absence of conscious technique and 
conventional thought and feeling. Eng- 
lish literature as a whole, the best of it 
included, he pronounced "essentially tame 
and civilized," imitative of the Classics. 
Grecian mythology had its root in a fertile 
'nature, but even the Classics fall short of 
a perfect wildness. Again, he peered into 
the past of his American civilization to see 
what primitive vigor lay behind the mod- 
ern culture. He had more than his share 
of the romantic absorption in the remote, 
in the primitive, in sources. "Strange 
spirits, demons," he says of the Indians, 
"whose eyes could never meet mine; with 
another nature and another fate than 
mine." The old warfare, waged in the 
very fields he walked on, seemed to him 
unreal, shadowy, and yet he loved to muse 
over it, with a still intensity, hoping now 
and again to obtain a true vision of the 
life or those far days. He would know 
"what manner of men they were, how they 
lived here, their relation to nature, their 
arts and their customs, their fancies and 
superstitions. They paddled over these 
waters, they wandered in these woods, and 
they had their fancies and beliefs con- 
nected with the sea and the forest, which 



concern us quite as much as the fables of 
Oriental nations do" ami that means a 
good deal when said by so devout a lover 
of the Bhagavat-(jita. 

Foolish indeed, our poets and philoso- 
phers, who regret that we have no an- 
tiquities, no ruins to remind us of our 
past, for everywhere is our soil laden with 
relics, arrowheads, implements, stone 
chips the wind can hardly blow away the 
surface, he says, without bringing to light 
the chips made by some aboriginal fletcher. 
>He looked for such relics incessantly. It 
was actually his habit, he states, when, in 
the fall, some sandy field had been plowed, 
to "take note of it," and next spring to 
pay a visit as soon as the earth began to 
dry. Often he spent whole afternoons, 
especially in the spring, in pacing back and 
forth over such a sandy field. Indian 
relics were the gold which the sands of 
Concord yielded, and indeed he often 
thought at night "with an inexpressible 
satisfaction and yearning of the arrow- 
headiferous sands of Concord." He 
trained his eye for an arrowhead to an 
astonishing keenness, so that, in compari- 
son, his walking companion, if he had one, 
was virtually blind. There is a familiar 
story that suggests this. His companion 
remarking, "I do not see where you 
find your Indian arrowheads," Thoreau 
stooped to the ground, picked one up, and 
gave it to him with the remark, "Here is 
one." Luck, in such matters, is always on 
the side of the sharp eye. 

Why did Thoreau admire the Indian? 
First, perhaps, on account of his relation 
to nature. The Indian was fitted to see 
and understand the wildness of nature as 
no white man could, because he was really 
at home in the woods. "The charm of the 
Indian to me is that he stands free and 
unconstrained in Nature, is her inhabitant 
and not her guest, and wears her easily 
and gracefully." He envied the Indian 
this familiar, off-hand relation, and re- 
produced it remarkably well when one con- 
siders how introspective he was. If he 
was at home anywhere, it was in the woods 
and meadows of Concord. And next he 
admired the Indian's reticence and stoi- 
cism. Though doubtless inborn in Thor- 
eau, these traits were almost certainly 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



11 



greatly strengthened in him through emu- 
lation : had there been no Indian back- 
ground, one suspects that his Indian traits 
would not have flourished. In "Walden" 
he relates with gusto the story of Win- 
slow's reception by Massasoit and his 
tribe. "They had nothing to eat them- 
selves, and they were wiser than to think 
that apologies could supply the place of 
food to their guests; so they drew their 
belts tighter and said nothing about it." 
Surely that is as typical of Thoreau as it 
is of Massasoit's Indians he went 
through life forever tightening his belt 
and saying nothing about it. It is mainly 
for these traits an easy relation to na- 
ture, reticence, and stoical endurance 
that Thoreau admired the Indian, aside, 
to be sure, from the misty picturesqueness 
of his life in aboriginal Concord. Noth- 
ing suggests better the intensity of his ad- 
miration than his death-bed words 
"moose" and "Indian." 

To the Maine woods he made two ex- 
cursions to satisfy his appetite for wild- 
ness and to study the Indian at first hand. 
He succeeded in learning a great deal, and 
in satisfying his appetite for wildness, to 
the point of nausea. He did not go to 
the woods, he complains, for moose-hunt- 
ing, and he condemns the Indian's savage- 
ness a very genuine type of wildness 
'roundly. "What a coarse and imperfect 
use Indians and hunters make of nature ! 
No wonder that their race is so soon ex- 
terminated. I already, and for weeks 
afterward, felt my nature the coarser for 
this part of my woodland experience." He 
returned to the "smooth but still varied 
landscape" of Concord with manifest re- 
lief. Wildness and the wilderness are a 
very good thing, no doubt, but they are 
not all of life; for a place to spend one's 
years in, it seemed to him, Concord was 
immeasurably superior to the wilderness, 
"necessary as the latter is for a resource 
and a background, the raw material of all 
our civilization." He goes on to remark 
that it is the partially cultivated country 
that has been the source of inspiration to 
the poets of the past, and will be to the 
poets of the future. The logger and pion- 
eer precede the poet eat the wild honey, 
perhaps, but the locusts also; remove the 



decaying wood and the spongy mosses of 
the rank forest, and build hearths and hu- 
manize nature for the poet. It is well for 
the poet, at proper intervals, to visit the 
logger's path and the Indian's trail; but 
let him dwell where "art and refinement" 
have altered the face of nature by making 
it more expressive, not only of man, but 
also to man. NORMAN FOERSTER. 



Literary Affairs in France 

(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 
There are many signs that internationalism is 
destined to play a large part in the world's affairs 
when the war closes and that literature and lit- 
erary matters are to share in the new activities. 
Two evidences of this in the French periodical 
field have just come to my attention. 

M. Georges-Bazile, a Paris translator and re- 
viewer, tells me that he has decided to revive 
the plan of the defunct "Revue Britannique" in 
a somewhat different form and with a broader 
title "Revue de France, de Grande-Bretagne 
et d'Amerique." It will be remembered that 
the old "Revue Britannique" flourished at Paris 
during the last half of the past century and ac- 
complished among magazines much what the 
"Tauchnitz Edition" did in the book-reading 
world on the European continent ; it presented to 
the foreign public what was best in the English 
and American monthlies. But the anti-British 
feeling which ran riot in France during the clos- 
ing years of the nineteenth century undermined 
this venerable periodical, and the present M. 
Amedee Pichot was forced, much to his regret, 
to bring to an end a publication which the en- 
ergy and broad-mindedness of his father had 
made almost an institution in Parisian intellectual 
circles. 

In regard to the new "Revue Britannique," 
M. Georges-Bazile writes me: 

My aim is to make known in France, liberal, liter- 
ary, and artistic England and America, especially the 
latter, and to profit by the triple friendship now 
strengthened on the battle field by propagating 
throughout the world sane ideas concerning a sen- 
sible pacifism. The review would also tend to de- 
velop the friendship and the present good relations 
existing between the three nations. Why doesn't 
France become the European university country of 
America, taking the place of Germany in this re- 
spect? This is one of the first campaigns the new 
periodical will enter upon ; and there are others, many 
others, to follow. 

International, too, but in another way, is "La 
Revue Contemporaine," which was founded in 
Paris at the beginning of the fifties to promote 
monarchy and reaction as an off-set to the pop-

ular commotions of 1848, but which long ago 
abandoned ideas on the wane in modern Frame 
and, last year, as a direct result of the war, came 
out as the organ of the "union nationale" and 
the "entente latine." M. Henri Ch. d'Osmos. 
the indefatigable editor of this reformed month 1\ , 
writes me as follows concerning the meaning of 
these two phrases: 

The union nationale is the union sacree of the war 
continued after the war, and the entente latine will 
be developed and transformed into an "occidental 
union," which will prepare the way for the future 
"congress of Anglo-Latin intellectuals." Our pages 
stand for these things and it is in this direction that 
our minds are now turned; here is the aim of all 
our efforts. 

A peculiar feature of this periodical is the 
utilization of notes and material which, when the 
war broke out, were being collected by a well- 
organized body of writers and editors who were 
publishing an important series of biographies of 
living celebrities "Les Archives Biographiques 
Contemporaines." It was destined to supply a 
long-felt want in France, where "Qui Etes- 
Vous?" the French "Who's Who," lasted but 
two years, and where "Vapereau" seems to have 
died with its editor. Each number of this 
monthly devotes a section to a dozen brief 
sketches of living men and women. It is to be 
hoped that these scattered notices will finally be 
brought together in volumes and added to the 
eight or nine in the series already mentioned. 

The lack of contemporary biography in France 
is also partially supplied by the four little vol- 
umes of the "Anthologie des Ecrivains Frangais 
Morts pour la Patrie" (Paris: Larousse, each 
volume 75 centimes), edited by M. Carlos Lar- 
ronde, with a stirring preface by M. Maurice 
Barres. In these volumes appear notices of over 
forty young French writers, killed at the front, 
along with selections from their works. 

One of these biographies is that of Major 
Joseph Vidal de la Blache, a military historian 
whose reputation was rising rapidly when he fell 
at the beginning of 1915. M. Ernest Lavisse 
has brought out the correspondence "Lettres" 
(Paris: Imprimerie Pochy, 25 centimes) sent 
from the trenches during the first six months of 
the war. It is no ordinary collection. The ec- 
centric mental and physical personality of 
Charles Peguy appears in the anthology, Peguy 
having been one of the first writers to fall, and 
perhaps the most famous. Oddly enough, how- 
ever, no place has been found for Joseph Lotte, 
Peguy's close friend, who was killed less than 
four months later. But this omission is made 
up for by M. Pierre Pacary's "Un Compagnon 
de Peguy" (Paris: Gabalda, 4 fr.), a book which, 
besides limning two strange lives, throws much 
light on the struggle in France between the 
Republic and the Catholic church. In fact, I 



know of no contemporary work which brings 
out more picturesquely the Catholic side of this 
contest. These pages also offer an odd example 
of a Johnson-Boswell episode, though of course 
on a much smaller scale than the famous proto- 
type Lotte playing the part of the Laird of 
Auchinleck and Peguy that of the Great Bear. 

As to the renewal of the old conflict in 
France between church and state, M. Maurice 
Barres thinks that the hatchet has been buried. 
His latest book, "Les Diverses Families Spirit- 
uelles de la France" (Paris: Emile-Paul, 3 fr. 
50), would seem at least to imply this conclu- 
sion. Or, perhapsj we have here a case of the 
wish being father to the thought. Anyway, it is 
a fine picture that he paints of the superb youth 
of France, united in the trenches in mind ami 
heart ; and some of the extracts from the home 
letters of these young men bring tears to the 
eyes. M. Barres is always an artist, and the 
subject lends itself magnificently to his delicate 
touch. 

Besides the Vidal correspondence just men- 
tioned, M. Lavisse has collected in a small vol- 
ume the series of "Lettres a Tous les Francois" 
(Paris: Colin, 1 fr.), which originally appeared 
as separate tracts. These letters, written for the 
most part by professors of the University of 
Paris, were issued in the summer of 1915, when 
Russia's weakness first began to cause misgivings 
in France. They urged upon the country, to 
quote the motto of the volume, "Patience, effort, 
courage." Scattered by hundreds of thousands 
all over the land, they must have done their part, 
and a large one, in preserving the fine morale of 
the nation, a morale which is the basis of M. 
Barres 's book. 

Another recent volume of French biography is 
the "Anthologie du Journalisme" (Paris: Dela- 
grave, 3 fr. 50), edited by M. Paul Ginisty, tin- 
well-known man of letters and theatre manager. 
He opens the book with an excellent essay on 
journalism in France, which is followed by short 
sketches of the leading journalists from the time 
of the first Revolution down to the Revolution of 
1848, each sketch being accompanied by selec- 
tions from the best work of the journalists. 
These pages well illustrate the truth of the 
French saying that journalism leads to e\ 
thing, provided only that you get out of it earlv 
enough. Thus we find such great poets, orators, 
philosophers, and novelists as the following 
classed here as "newspaper men": Mirabeau, 
Condorcet, Chenier, Guizot, Chateaubriand. 
Victor Hugo, Alfred de Musset, Balzac, George 
Sand, and the Abbe Lamennais! 

Another curious list of names, though of quite 
a different sort, is found in the book by M. Henri 
Welschinger, of the Institute, "La Mendicite 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



Allemande aux Tuileries" (Paris: Berger-Lev- 
rault, 1 fr. ), in which appear scores of Germans 
of all classes and of all intellectual conditions 
who asked favors and even money of Napoleon 
III, or who fawned upon him during the Second 
Empire. The list was drawn from the official 
records of the Tuileries and extends over a period 
of eighteen years. Nobles, so-called, professors 
and poets from over the Rhine abound; and 
scattered among them are the names of several 
mfnor Hohenzollerns, a relative of Bismarck, the 
historians, Hiiffer, Sybel, and Mommsen, Pro- 
fessor Helfferich, a relative of the present im- 
perial minister of finance, Prince William of 
Baden, and Hans von Billow. May not such a 
lamentable list as this have suggested to M. 
Welschinger this reflection, which appears in the 
note accompanying his book? 

This world-war will have the best effect on French 
literature. It will strengthen and clarify the spirit 
of the country. It will lift up our hearts and souls. 
It will rid us of the literary vermin who have done 
so much harm in leading foreigners to believe that 
we were degenerate. The novel, history, criticism, 
and the theatre will then be worthy of a country 
which has displayed to the world its real heroism and 
its true spirit of generosity. 

A book of reference unlike those already men- 
tioned is M. Joseph Reinach's "Histoire de 
Douze Jours" (Paris: Felix Alcan, 12 fr.), 
which gives the history of the diplomatic origin 
of the present war and covers the period from 
July 23, to August 3, 1914. We have there, ar- 
ranged in twelve chapters, each chapter embrac- 
ing the dispatches of a single day, all the 
diplomatic correspondence exchanged by the fu- 
ture belligerents during this short and fatal 
period. M. Reinach admits that "it is pretty 
certain that these dispatches are only selections 
chosen from among those really sent at that 
moment, and that the text of the dispatches is 
not always complete. . . But just as they 
stand, the aggressive spirit of those of German 
origin comes out on every page of this volume. 
. . If a German or Austrian publisher were 
to translate this book, he wouldn't be allowed to 
put it on sale." 

Here is the place, perhaps, to say a word of 
a pamphlet, "Leurs Crimes" (Paris: Berger- 
Levrault, 25 centimes), published in popular 
form for propaganda purposes under the patron- 
age of the mayors of more than a score of towns 
of the invaded regions of northern and eastern 
France which have suffered from Teutonic ex- 
cesses. It was sent to me by the mayor of Ver- 
dun, who is installed at Paris as a result of the 
ruined condition of "our dear city." It is a 
dreadful picture of war made unnecessarily hor- 
rible. 

Of course Verdun is also the scene of M. 
Gaston Jollivet's "L'Epopee de Verdun" (Paris: 



Hachette, 3 fr. 50), which traces in detail the 
history of that nine months' memorable defence. 
But I mention this book largely to call attention 
to the significant state of mind of its author, a 
veteran Paris journalist of the old school, who up 
to August, 1914 was an uncompromising enemy 
of the republican regime in France, but who now 
says to me: "After this war, we must all unite 
in a loyal effort to make this the best possible 
republic." He then asks for the titles of the 
principal books on democratic government in the 
United States. We have another instance of in- 
creased interest in our country and its institu- 
tions in the May number of the "Journal des 
Economistes," to which the editor, M. Yves 
Guyot, contributes "La Formation Politique des 
Etats-Unis," an article which precisely meets the 
demand of M. Jollivet and his friends.

GOD, THE INVISIBLE KING. By H. G. Wells. 
(Macmillan Co.; $1.25.) 

The killing and the bloody anguish, the de- 
struction of lovely and valuable things, the hor- 
ror and sorrow in the hearts of those who remain 
are disasters immeasurable; but the greatest dis- 
aster of all is spiritual, intellectual; it is the 
stupefied brain, the soul that has been bludgeoned 
and stunned. It is not to be wondered at that 
English men of letters have lost their inspira- 
tion, that war has smashed the lips of poetry 
and that philosophy has fled from her seat. Per- 
haps the greater wonder is that in the midst 
of conflict men have courage to write at all. 
Of the English writers to whom we were once 
accustomed to look, if not for ultimate wisdom, 
at least for helpful correlations of current 
thought, few have kept their wits undeafened by 
the din, unblinded by the smoke. The most 
notable are Bernard Shaw, Bertrand Russell, 
and H. N. Brailsford. On the other hand, such 
capable commentators on the human being as 
Rudyard Kipling and Arnold Bennett give us 
second-rate journalism. Mr. Chesterton, stand- 
ing on his head, announces every week that no 
German is standing on his feet. And the sad- 
dest case of mental degeneration is that of H. G. 
Wells. 

The direction of Mr. Wells's decadence is a 
normal result of war. When men lose control 
of their lives and fortunes and the whole world 
seems to be plunging to hell, they take refuge 
in mysticism and superstitious consolations. An 
earthquake sends them screaming to the skirts 
of the gods. On a sinking ship men fall upon 
their knees who have never learned or have long

forgotten how to pray. Bewildered Britlin^ 
cease to trust themselves and society; their old 
philosophies and sciences crumble ; they cast about 
for something they can trust and turn to reli- 
gion. It is more than likely that after this war, 
no matter how impotent the churches seem to 
be, there will be a recrudescence of religion, a 
period of mysticism, of reactionary thinking 
which will last until people recover self-con- 
fidence and stability. Wells's belated discovery 
of religion is normal and natural; the only ab- 
normal thing about it is that he seemed not to 
be the sort of man who would lose his grip on 
reality and find satisfaction in religious common- 
place. 

And yet Wells has always shown a fundamen- 
tal weakness of which his latest book is one ex- 
pression. He is an incurable romantic, and his 
imagination is muddled. For all the brilliancy 
of his thought and his electric lucidity of phrase, 
he seldom keeps his ideas pure. He adulterates 
studies of society, novels, with sociological the- 
ory, and he corrupts his discussions of social and 
political problems with sheer fiction. He mixes 
stories of contemporaneous life with what he 
calls fantastic and imaginative romance. "In 
the Days of the Comet" is spoiled by a love story 
which is lugged in by the heels or the heart; 
without it that interesting book would have suc- 
ceeded even with a love-loving public. "Tono 
Bungay," which should have been an excellent 
story of modern life, is damaged by an unneces- 
sary expedition to Africa in search of "quap," a 
mysterious metal which does not exist and which 
ought not to be invented in that kind of book. 
In the phrase of the day, Wells gets his wires 
crossed. 

In "God, The Invisible King," the crossing of 
wires produces irritating crackles, occasional 
flashes of light, but no steady flame. Wells dis- 
cusses vast uncertainties in a tone of cocksure cer- 
titude. He writes of God as he once wrote of 
flying machines. Bill Nye, of genial memory, 
said that he had been reading an interesting book 
by the Reverend Joseph Cook, of Boston, called 
"A Bird's-eye View of God." Wells in his air- 
plane sweeps over the universe at terrific speed, 
cutting figure eights and looping the loop just 
to show off and enjoy the power of his wings, 
surveys the Almighty, drops bombs into the camp 
of the orthodox believer and into the camp of the 
atheist, sees at a glance that neither can shoot 
straight, and comes back with a triumphant flour- 
ish of discovery to tell us all about it. To be 
sure he does not pretend to invention or dis- 
covery; he disclaims it. "I have been but scribe 
to the spirit of my generation." God only 
knows, his God only knows, who gave him his 
credentials as authentic scribe to the spirit of a 



generation which is a confusion of many spirits 
and which is so diversified, such a contest of 
physical ami spiritual forces, that no man can see 
it whole even from an airplane. He says that 
he has "at most assembled and put together 
things and thoughts" that he has come upon, and 
"transferred the statements of 'science' into re- 
ligious terminology." (That transference is a 
perfect example of crossed wires.) 

Wells has put together with a good deal of 
skill the things and thoughts that he has come 
upon; he has arranged them in his habitually 
neat chapters and sections; he has ticketed and 
pigeonholed aspects of the True God and the 
false gods, or, since pigeonholes are not toler- 
ated in modern business, he has filed his thoughts 
and things in a steel filing-cabinet ; and this in 
spite of his own adjuration "that you try to set 
no nets about God." "Chapter the Second : Her- 
esies; or the Things That Are Not God. (1) 
Heresies Are Misconceptions of God. . . (3) 
God Is Not Magic." And so on, all in clear, 
compact literary method. There is much ad- 
mirable phrasing, now and again a vivid met- 
aphor. But I wish to the Lord (I believe that 
prayer is allowed by the Wellsian theology) I 
knew what the old-fashioned Almighty thinks 
about Wells's Finite God and what Wells's 
Finite God makes out of Wells's presentation of 
him. 

Not having the advantage of that intimacy 
with God which Mr. Wells seems to be favored 
with, I must confine myself to things and 
thoughts that are human and mundane and cap- 
able of some sort of verification. Not only does 
Wells fail to content me with his report of the 
thoughts and things of my generation, but he 
seems to be ignorant of thoughts that were com- 
monplace a generation ago. Oddly enough, he is 
not in the forefront of thought but is behind the 
times. Much that he has to say was stale (not 
old, for the age of a thought does not damage 
it, but stale) before Matthew Arnold wrote his 
once lively and perturbing heresies. We got all 
that long ago, accepted it, took it for granted, 
and stopped worrying about it. We could have 
got most of it at about the same time or a little 
earlier from Kenan, and much of it a long, long 
time ago from Voltaire. It is as if Wells had 
come upon an airplane of ten years ago, had 
mended it himself, and learned to navigate with 
skill and daring, but was all the time sublimely 
unconscious that that type and many later im- 
provements had been sent to the scrap-heap. He 
seems not even to have understood William 
James, whom he calls his friend and master; 
certainly he has missed James's spirit and fine 
manners. For when James developed the idea 
of a finite God and laid before us the consoling

idea that there may be forces in the universe 
more or less on our side, he said, "may be," not, 
"absolutely are, and if you don't believe it you're 
wrong." James wooed the idea of God; Wells 
violates it. James was magnificently hospitable 
' to other people's gods and no-gods. The central 
theme of "Varieties of Religious Experience" is 
the reality of the other man's experience; let us 
try to understand what other people have been 
through, accept their testimony about something 
they know better than we do, before we attempt 
to assess the value of that testimony and assemble 
conclusions from the statements of many wit- 
nesses. If you do not accept Wells's God, you 
not only miss heaven but are wiped off the earth, 
ruled out of its warm living human contacts. 
Listen to this egregious intolerance : 

The benevolent atheist stands alone upon his own 
good will, without a reference, without a standard, 
trusting to his own impulse to goodness, relying upon 
his own moral strength. A certain immodesty, a cer- 
tain self-righteousness, hangs like a precipice above 
him. . . He has no one to whom he can give him- 
self. . . His exaltation is self-centered, is priggish- 
ness. . . He has no source of strength beyond his 
own amiable sentiments, his conscience speaks with 
an unsupported voice, and no one watches while he 
sleeps. He cannot pray; he can but ejaculate. He 
has no real and living link with other men of good 
will. 

As an atheist, I hope a benevolent one, I can 
assure Mr. Wells that the foregoing propositions 
are the cheekiest buncombe that I have read since 
I read a report of a sermon by the Reverend 
Billy Sunday. The old theologians consigned us 
to hell fire, a problematic punishment which is 
still in the future for those of us who are left 
on the earth. The Reverend Mr. Wells denies 
our humanity and falsifies psychology. If I had 
time I should lay him out, Chapter the First, 
Section 1. But it is not worth while. I will 
only suggest that he is the last man in the world 
to charge other men with immodesty, that there 
are other modes of expression besides prayer and 
ejaculation, and that the links that we have with 
other men of good will (and of ill will) are as 
real and living as anything in the human breast. 
And one thing more: Mr. Wells wishes to im- 
press his ideas upon the world, to make converts. 
If so, he goes at the task in exactly the wrong 
way. His facile dethronement of the old gods 
will not disturb their votaries. His insolent 
attitude toward the godless, whom he might win 
to a new and living conception of God, if he 
had one, alienates them, arouses their intellec- 
tual contempt (if he likes, their pride and prig- 
gishness), incites them to say over again the 
line from the "Hymn to Proserpine": 

I kneel not, neither adore you, but standing, look 
to the end.

(Century Co.; $2.) 

A more varied collection of volumes than 
this it is indeed difficult to imagine. But, with 
the exception of Prince Biilow's book, they have 
in common the single characteristic of being 
quite painfully unimportant. Mr. Ossiannilsson 
shows us that one Swede, at any rate, is not pro- 
German, but the rest of his thought is entirely 
unilluminating and utterly unimportant. Mr. 
Fisher Unwin's patriotism must indeed be ex- 
treme if it could so far obscure his usually alert 
intelligence as to make him publish these dull 
platitudes. Mr. Curtin is one of Lord North- 
cliffe's young men; and he has his patron's fac- 
ulty of making our flesh creep with quite 
exceptional hideousness. The book he has writ- 
ten will tell any reader what Mr. Curtin says 
he saw inside the German empire; but I think 
that he will conclude that his author has still 
to learn the value of historic and psychological 
light and shade. M. Bainville has written a 
straightforward and simple narrative of the case 
for Italy, and he usefully makes plain the diffi- 
culties of the baffling campaign she has had to 
fight. The exact purpose of Dr. Brandes's 
book I have not been able to discover. It tells 
us a good deal about Dr. Brandes. One learns 
that he is very sensitive and that he loves a 
certain impossible attitude which he calls impar- 
tiality. But, as a whole, the book is evidence 
that the expert had better stick to his province. 
In the interpretation of literature many of us 
are anxious to hear what Dr. Brandes has to 
say. As a publicist, he is quite frankly third- 
rate. His book is a rehash of old material and 
new comment which has no permanent value of 
any kind. Mr. Gleason has performed an ex- 
tremely able journalistic feat. His volume is a 
very skilfully composed encyclopaedia of English 
thought to-day. Everyone is there Mr. 
Lansbury, Mr. Zimmern, Mr. Lionel Curtis, 
Mr. Webb. Labels of identification are attached 
to them all. An ordinary Englishman like my- 
self may again and again have real difficulty 
in recognizing some of the portraits. Mr. Glea- 
son works rapidly, and he is a little naive. But 
his book has a real interim value as a cinemato-

graph and it is extraordinarily pleasant reading. 
Mr. Stoddard keeps a large pair of scissors by 
his side. He has industriously gone through the 
files of immense numbers of European newspa- 
pers. These he arranged territorially, and any- 
one who wants, for debating purposes, a kind 
of campaign-book of public opinion will find his 
book useful. But it is quite without critical 
value. 

Of very different calibre is Prince Billow's 
volume. A new edition of a book published 
first some five years ago, it is, I imagine, among 
the half-dozen most significant productions of 
the work. It is admirably translated, and the 
new material is bracketed so that it can be dis- 
tinguished from the old. Written as it is by one 
who, with the single exception of the German 
Emperor, is more responsible than any other man 
for the present catastrophe, it is little less than 
a public duty for everyone who wishes adequately 
to understand the present situation to read it. 

It is a realistic book. Prince Biilow does not 
becloud his thought with fine phrases or pious 
aspirations. He is perfectly clear as to what he 
wants, and his frank belief in the rectitude of 
his demands is refreshing. He is convinced that 
Germany is the natural leader of the world. 
Culturally, industrially, socially, she is far in 
advance of any other nation. It is then fitting 
that the political situation should give expression 
to her aptitude for leadership. He does not 
doubt that the object of world politics is power, 
and he explains how that power is to be attained. 
England stood in the way of German domina- 
tion, and while his building of the German navy 
was not intended as a threat against England, 
it was intended that henceforth Germany should 
have no reason to fear the control of her actions 
on sea or land by the superiority of any other 
nation. He regards himself as the successor of 
Bismarck, and it is the same policy of Wtltmacht 
that he claims to have pursued. His whole con- 
ception of international relations is based upon 
the terrible chimera of the balance of power, 
and he obviously considers concerted European 
action of any kind a fantastic dream. He is 
entirely uninterested in effort after European 
organization, so that neither the Hague confer- 
ences nor proposals for international disarma- 
ment even make an appearance in his pages. He 
simply conceived that foreign policy could be 
summed up in the desire of Germany to grow 
strong, and the desire of England to prevent her 
from being strong. In his view, the fatal mis- 
take of English statesmen was not to strike 
against Germany before she had become too dan- 
gerous for attack to be lightly undertaken. Of 
the irreconcilability of France he was convinced ; 
for the friendship of Russia he cared little. The 
Triple Alliance he felt sure of Italy made him 



feel that the domination of Germany could be 
secured before the other powers realized that it 
had in fact been achieved. If there seems some- 
thing sinister in this conception of a frank mer- 
cantilism in foreign affairs, he will merely shrug 
his shoulders and argue that it is the way of the 
world. He builds the life of the state around its 
army, and he is clear that its activity and organ- 
ization must not be subject to political inflm-ncr. 
Indeed, he feels the more certain of that be- 
cause, in his view, the one deficiency in the Ger- 
man character is the lack of a political instinct. 
That, of course, leads him to insist that the thor- 
oughgoing parliamentarism of England or France 
or America is unsuited to German conditions. 
He dislikes the tendency in Germany to create 
a multiform and complex group-life, which we 
are coming more and more to recognize as, in 
fact, the condition of liberty, and he urges 
that some modification is essential to German 
needs. He deprecates the party system on the 
ground that it subordinates national interests to 
separatist interests a foreigner can hardly read 
this criticism of German parties without amaze- 
ment and he insists that it breeds a dangerous 
opposition to government. He believes that the 
real object of domestic policy is simply tranquil- 
lity and the best means those which most easily 
secure that end. He has the Bismarckian hatred 
of the Social Democrats and the Bismarckian 
suspicion of the Catholic Centre. He does not 
doubt that the moral centre of the German na- 
tion is built round the Hohenzollern dynasty, 
and he insists that upon it the successful future 
of Germany depends. 

Such was the attitude of Prince Biilow when 
his book was first published in 1913. The 
tragedy of this new edition is the fact that not 
even the terrible experience of the last three 
years has led him to modify a single conclusion. 
Rather, on the contrary, does it seem to have for- 
tified his outlook. He believes, of course, in 
the invincibility of Germany. But what is re- 
markable in his added reflections is the absence 
of any of the bitterness which distinguishes, for 
example, the writings of Professor von Meyer or 
Count von Reventlow. He looks at the war 
with the cold detachment of an observer \vho 
watches a predetermined, logical process. He 
has no room for moral considerations of any 
kind. Causes and results he does not even ex- 
press in the language of a democratic commu- 
nity. The only point for his consideration is 
whether Germany will emerge stronger or 
weaker from the war. What she has done has 
been justified in his view by the conviction that 
it was either in her hands or in that of some 
other power that the key to world control had 
to lie. He is of course convinced that it would 
be better for Germany to secure domination.

It is difficult not to be convinced in our turn 
that only the shock of complete defeat can change 
so amazing an attitude. When Mr. Wilson in- 
sisted that the world must be made safe for 
democracy, the ideal which underlay his words 
was in fact the precise antithesis of this grim 
and sinister materialism. Whatever may have 
been our failure in this crisis, the splendor of 
ideals has been made clear to us. We have seen 
very definitely that the old terms of international 
existence have become obsolete. Prince Billow's 
book is the last defiant challenge of an order 
that can be tolerated no longer. We have done 
with the civilization of dynasties and commercial 
oligarchy. We must attach the instruments of 
power to new purposes that have richer promise. 
It is, indeed, a long and difficult task. But it 
is exactly therein that we find its splendor.

The Renaissance in Spain 

SPANISH ARCHITECTURE OF THE SIXTEENTH CEN- 
TURY. By Arthur Bryne and Mildred Stapley. 
(G. P. Putnam's Sons; $7.50.) 

In obedience to that good law by which civ- 
ilized life is periodically cleansed of its accumu- 
lated corruptions, we are to-day in presence of 
tidal changes the nature and effects of which 
are difficult to understand. To our amazement 
we find not only that the Nineteenth Century 
has become infinitely distant, but that a past 
more remote has become suddenly and thrillingly 
near. 

The sense of this is particularly present in 
reading such a book as "Spanish Architecture in 
the Sixteenth Century," for it is concerned with 
the last great epochal reversal of consciousness 
before the one now under way. For the Renais- 
sance was a reaction from Mediaevalism to those 
humanistic and scientific engrossments and en- 
thusiasms which have persisted even up to the 
present time. 

The Renaissance, "that first transcendent 
springtide of the modern world," came later in 
Spain than in Italy, where the mildness was 
first felt. Enrique de Egas, the earliest prac- 
titioner of the new architectural art the obra 
del romano, as the Spanish began by calling it 
was spelling out a word here and a word there 
in the new vernacular, at a time when Peruzzi 
and Bramante, men of the Golden Noon, were 
producing finished masterpieces in an already 
transformed Milan, Siena, Rome, and Florence. 

Egas, unlike Brunelleschi, the great precursor, 
w r as a Gothic architect, not alone by training 
and experience but in the very complexion of his 
mind. He did not aim, as did Brunelleschi, to 
revolutionize structure by reverting to that of 



the Romans, but only to introduce a new note, 
borrowed from Lombard craftsmen, into orna- 
ment. This lesser ambition proved a happy 
thing for Spain. It meant that her great in- 
herited tradition remained unbroken: she put 
on, not a shackle, but a bracelet wondrously 
chased. 

Spanish architecture is free, in the main, from 
certain vices resultant from the zeal of the 
convert and from the pedantry of too great 
knowledge, such as the fretting up of noble 
walls with meaningless pilasters, and the inter- 
position between a column and an arch of an 
isolated entablature. Moreover, the Moorish 
influence, with its gift of color and romance, 
lends a note which makes the architecture of 
the Renaissance in Spain totally different from 
its manifestation in other times and places, 
worthy of the sympathetic and serious treatment 
it has received at the hands of these authors, 
in this truly admirable work. 

Spanish Renaissance architecture until, un- 
der Philip II and his architect, Juan de Her- 
rera, it relapsed into that pedantry which- lay 
like a dead hand on all Europe was clearly 
differentiated from that of any other country, 
possessing characteristics well marked and there- 
fore easily described. Its most obvious and 
admirable merit consisted in a constant observ- 
ance of that polarity which always ought to 
exist between the wall and its penetrations and 
termination doors, windows, cornice, and the 
like. That is, the wall was treated as a wall; 
its weight, mass, and extent of surface were 
duly respected. String courses marked, as they 
should, the major internal horizontal divisions, 
and the eye was duly prepared for the inevitable 
end by high arcades surmounted by sumptuous 
cornices. Entrances were accented and given 
due importance by frontispieces delightfully free 
and rich. Windows were similarly framed in 
ornament and further embellished by balconies 
and iron grilles of superb design and craftsman- 
ship. But the crowning glory of these buildings 
is seen in their patios, or interior arcaded courts. 
It is doubtful if this feature has ever elsewhere 
received more logical and inspired treatment by 
architects. Compared with the best of them 
Bramante's famous Cancelleria court seems stiff 
and monotonous, and the Moorish court of the 
Alhambra looks sugary and thin. They are 
usually in two stages, an upper and a lower, 
exhibiting a well-marked difference of propor- 
tion, the upper sometimes doubly divided, with 
an intermediate column over the centre of the 
lower arch. The mouldings of the architraves 
of the arches were often delicately interlaced, 
and where a lintel replaced the arch it was sup- 
ported by fancifully shaped consoles projecting 
between the column's necking and abacus. The 



18

[June JS 



stairways leading off these courts were aim..-- 
always noble in proportion, of easy slope, the 
balustrade ornamented with almost Gothic lux- 
uriance and freedom. Another fine and charac- 
teristic feature is seen in the wooden ceilings, of 
geometrical design, richly carved and highly 
colored, showing the persistence of Moorish in- 
fluence. 

Taken all together, it may be said that Span- 
ish Renaissance architecture, particularly in its 
first phase, is a style as distinctive and dis- 
tinguished as that of Italy or France, and elo- 
quent, like them, of the time, the race, the place 
in which it budded, bloomed, and faded into 
this "winter of our discontent." 

The authors of "Spanish Architecture in the 
Sixteenth Century" have performed their work 
well so well that the book must take an hon- 
ored place in every architectural library with 
any pretense to completeness. Not only does 
the volume contain more than two hundred illus- 
trations, but many of these are carefully meas- 
ured drawings, the value of which, to an 
architect, is greater than any photograph, how- 
ever good. The text is historical as regards the 
style, biographical as regards its most famous 
practitioners, and critical in the discussion of the 
more famous buildings. It is written in an 
authoritative, interesting way, from full knowl- 
edge and deep love of the subject. The authors, 
the publisher, and the public to which the book 
makes its appeal (a public unfortunately small) 
are alike to be congratulated. 

The worst service a reviewer can perform is to 
make his review so exhaustive as to deceive the 
interested reader into the belief that it relieves 
him of the necessity of buying and reading the 
book. Fortunately the imposed limits of this re- 
view make such a thing impossible. Let me 
rather, in the little remaining space at my dis- 
posal, sound a warning to the young designer 
seduced by the beauty of the Sixteenth Century 
Spanish Architecture into an attempt to play "the 
sedulous ape." If he is content to copy the 
style without understanding the social, political, 
and psychological forces which gave it birth, he 
will fail unutterably: if he copies it with a full 
understanding of all these things, he will still 
fail; for that betrays in him a graver ignorance 
an ignorance of the social, political, and psy- 
chological forces which move us now. It is for 
him not to copy, but to create. A book like this 
book is a stimulant to the creative faculty. Let 
him nerve himself to the production of a dif- 
ferent but not inferior beauty, one consistent 
with modern life, modern conditions, and mod- 
ern building methods. CLAUDE BRAGDON.

TRICKS OF THE TRADE. B. J. C. Squire. (Mar- 
tin Seeker; 2s. 6.) 

Few things in the perplexing poetry of to-day 
are clearer to the unprejudiced reader than it- 
usual fineness and delicacy of technique unless, 
indeed, its occasional and sporadic, nearly always 
deliberate, badness. The tiniest poeticule in the 
remotest environs of Parnassus can warble forth 
a stave that would not have shamed Herrick or 
Campion. In spite of the fact that verse-making 
in English has grown steadily more difficult from 
the time of Chaucer to our own, in spite of our 
recent rejection of specialized poetic diction and 
all the easy-going poetic licenses and padding ex- 
pletives of earlier days, we are actually writing 
better verse, qua verse, it would seem, than any 
but the best men in their best moments wrote 
a century ago. 

The situation is precisely that of which Tenny- 
son illogically and ungratefully complained 
"Most can raise the flowers now, for all have 
got the seed." Much of the deliberate badness 
of contemporary versifying'is due to the feeling 
a well-known sign of over-cultivation that re- 
finement has been carried to its ultimate limits. 
A case in point is that of Mr. W. W. Gibson, 
who began his career by writing long narrative 
poems in the most "precious" and exigent stanza 
structures and who later turned to what one 
sees. Without implying that vers libre is in any 
sense bad versification, it may be pointed out that 
its vogue is partly due to the same sort of poetic 
atavism. 

These considerations, whatever truth or faUit\ 
they may contain, are far more charitable to cur- 
rent tendencies than those which Mr. Watson 
presents in his recent volume of criticism in 
verse, "Retrogression." A perfectionist in verse 
of the direct Tennysonian lineage, he attacks 
with all his powers of epigram this contempo- 
rary delight in the intentionally crude and 
crabbed. For example, in the poem "Nature's 
Way," which is a more compact versified vade 
mecum of classicism that Boileau's or Roscom- 
m< Hi's, he makes a direct drive at the school of 
the "barbaric yawp." "Faultily faultless im\ 
be ill," he says, but "Carefully careless is worse 
still." He correctly traces the "loose-lipped 



1917] 



THE DIAL

lingo of the street," which he finds characteristic 
of present-day poetry, to a pretended worship of 
"Art's uncorrupted mother, Nature." Somehow 
Mr. Watson manages to make this sort of thing 
at once thrilling as attack, trenchant as crit- 
icism, and beautiful as poetry. 

With this poem and much else in his book 
that is sound in thought and brilliant in phrase, 
Mr. Watson will find more sympathizers than 
he may realize or even desire for he seems to 
enjoy thinking of himself as a sort of "lonely an- 
tagonist of destiny," a last survivor of the giants 
before the flood. It is a pity that this mood of 
haughty isolation has grown so strong in his 
work of late, and a misfortune that he has not 
been content to go on writing such noble things 
as the "Hymn to the Sea" and "To the Un- 
known God," but has become more and more 
feverishly concerned, it would seem, with his 
own reputation. The man who has successfully 
challenged Keats in "Ode to Autumn" and 
Arnold in "Wordsworth's Grave" and Milton 
himself in "Lachrymas Musarum," might well 
afford to let alone all really ignorant or merely 
spiteful criticism of his work. That he has been 
unable to do so is lamentable evidence that this 
sole or at least supreme living representative of 
the classic mode in English poetry has fallen into 
the deepest and darkest of romantic pitfalls 
egoism. It is just because one feels so deeply the 
truth of what he says about himself and his work 
that one wishes another pen than his had traced 
the painful lines entitled "Confidence." 
When criticasters of a day 
Seem to have sneered me quite away; 
When with a pontiff's frown 
Some dabbler puts me down ; 

When up from out the nursery start 
Sages to teach me mine own art 
Guides in that field my share 
Ploughed long before they were; 

When guests of fashion brief as vain 
Sow wide a tasteless taste inane; 

When Folly, night and morn, 

Scatters on me her scorn ; 

When they who could bestow, refuse 
With deathless spite the admitted dues; 

When slanderous lips aver 

I am the slanderer; 

Then, draining mine appointed cup, 
In patience do I gird me up, 

Knowing that Time, one day, 

All his arrears will pay. 

There is some danger that the poetry of 
Flecker, like that of his friend Brooke, may be 
rated higher for a time than it deserves. Con- 
sidering the inevitability of the recoil, there is 
no kindness to the poet's memory in helping on 
this sentimental tendency. He should be judged, 
as he would have wished, by what he actually ac- 
complished. He left a fairly large amount of 
work for a man who died at thirty, and most of 



this was carefully revised before his death. Ex- 
cept for those distinctly marked as early, few of 
his poems are clearly experimental or immature. 
Everywhere in them one sees an alert and manly 
mind moving easily and habitually upon high 
levels. His achievement in verse is consistently 
high, but no single poem stands out as specially 
memorable. One catches many a glint and glim- 
mer of the full moon of poesy, but these are no- 
where gathered into a single broad beam. His 
best things are not in the best places but seem 
of the texture rather than of the design. 

In passing from the poems of Flecker to those 
of Mr. O'Brien, we move from the Hellenic 
dawn albeit a modern Hellas, a Hellas of the 
Parnassians into that Celtic Twilight wherein 
no Saxon mind can long know North from 
South or the right hand from the left. Vague 
shapes, which we can easily imagine beautiful 
because they are so dimly seen, move toward us 
through the floating vapor of this poetry and re- 
cede into it again, with muffled words and un- 
intelligible gestures. I must disregard the two 
long odes which take up more than half the book. 
The second of these is a mystic poem of serene 
beauty and deep significance. The first is more 
like Whitman's "Children of Adam" than any- 
thing else in American poetry which I have 
read, and it is marred by the same lack of humor, 
judgment, self-criticism. The poet has not tried 
to imagine how his successive aves to the various 
portions of his anatomy would sound to an im- 
partial listener. He has forgotten that even 
poetic composition contains some social element. 
He has not considered the possibility that poetry 
may be even overheard. While a careful and 
sympathetic reader will certainly find a high in- 
tention in this first ode, he will almost cer- 
tainly be sorry that it was written in such a com- 
plete social vacuum a feature sufficiently 
signalized by the fact that the poet while com- 
posing it, as in the case of other poems in the 
book, was presumably nude. 

Perhaps John Keats would have admitted that 
half-heard melodies are sweetest. The melodies 
in the second part of Mr. O'Brien's book are 
half-heard. He gives us little more than snatches 
of lovely themes, and these we elaborate to our 
own liking. Frequently the result is a quintes- 
sential poetry from which all dross of special 
meaning is purged away. 

Mr. O'Brien is a lover of pouring light. He 
cares little for sharply defined form or for color 
witness his overuse of "white" and "gold." 
His poems abound in delicate fancy and his words 
have "elvish music in the weave." No more 
rarified and ethereal poetry is to be found than 
he has given us in the small group of lyrics at 
the end of his book. If, to the fine Celtic qual- 
ities already so clear in his verse, he could but 



20 



THE DIAL 



[June 28 



add humor, restraint, poise, clarity why then he 
would cease to be an Irish poet, and that 
thing not to be thought of. Yet, if he could 
only follow up the frequently thrilling and won- 
derful first stanzas of his better lyrics, such, 
for example, as that of "Magic," he would have 
taken a long step away from the vague, nymph- 
oleptic longing which makes so much of his work 
merely obscure toward the always desirable 
qualities of structure, form, design. 

As illustration of some of the things 1 have 
said about Mr. O'Brien's work, I shall quote 
"Off Chatham Bars" rather than "The Whisper 
of Earth," which I prefer, but which has been 
more frequently reprinted. 

Light, and the cry of the wild dove flying 

Over the pathless sunset home, 
Out of the mist of sighing waters 

Into the silent dying foam. 

Nightfall slowly hushing to stillness, 
Murmur of shingle slipping down, 

Throbbing pulse of the passionate spirit 
Brooding over the sleeping town. 

The veins of the world are flooding inward, 
Earth-flame curls in the running blood, 

And flesh, an island in chartless oceans, 
Scourged by the lash of the flying scud. 

Flowers in stars of adoration, 

Chaunting loud to the singing tide, 

Wind and moon and waters obeying, 
Bridegroom flaming unto the Bride. 

It must have taken courage to put together 
the little anthology of Oxford poetry for 1916. 
Many voices from that "nest of singing birds" 
have been stilled of late some of which we had 
heard, and there is a sober hush over all this 
poetry which one does not find it hard to ac- 
count for. The collection is small, extending 
to only sixty pages, but it is very good through- 
out and has nothing to fear on the score of 
beauty or maturity from comparison with any 
anthology that has been or may be made of con- 
temporary poetry in English. Among the names 
that one hopes to meet again are those of A. L. 
Huxley, of Balliol, whose powerful though 
crabbed "Mole" reminds one a little of Fulke 
Greville, and Sherard Vines, whose strangely 
beautiful "Song of the Elm" reminds one of 
nothing else in the world. But there is power 
and beauty on nearly every page. One cannot 
help wondering whether any American univer- 
sity, or, to make the comparison fairer, any group 
of American universities, could do as well. The 
recent anthology of American college verse would 
seem to indicate a negative answer. 

The sort of "western verse" one finds in 
Arthur Chapman's volume has been familiar since 
the days of Bret Harte. It was carried to its 
highest level which, after all, was rather low 
by Eugene Field many years ago. Mr. Chapman 
phrases the old facile philosophy of "God's Out- 



of-Doors" in a manner not very novel or very 
attractive in itself. The title poem is said by 
the publishers to be "perhaps the best-known bit 
of verse in America. It hangs framed in tin- 
office of the Secretary of the Interior at Wash- 
ington. It has been quoted in Congress, and 
printed as campaign material for at least two 
governors." After this recommendation, one is 
hardly surprised to discover that it is merely an 
inept and sentimental phrasing of the braggadocio 
of the far West. 

In Mr. Squire's "Tricks of the Trade" we 
have one of the most diverting books of parody 
in recent years. Its range is wide from Pope 
to Davies and almost as many styles of pa rod u 
writing are exhibited as there are styles parodied. 
In the first half are ten imitations of the work 
of contemporary writers, mostly poets. In the 
second are ten duplex parodies which keep two 
balls in the air at once in a bewildering but often 
brilliant fashion. These burlesques are fre- 
quently criticism of no mean order. The best 
of them, and one which deserves to live, like 
the "Rehearsal," long after the object of its at- 
tack is forgotten, is the one entitled "If Gray 
Had Had to Write His Elegy in the Cemetery 
of Spoon River Instead of that of Stoke Poges." 
I can quote from it only a few stanzas. 

The curfew tolls the knell of parting day, 
The whippoorwill salutes the rising moon, 

And wanly glimmer in her gentle ray, 
The sinuous windings of the turbid Spoon. 

Here where the flattering and mendacious swarm 
Of lying epitaphs their secrets keep, 

At last incapable of further harm, 

The lewd forefathers of the village sleep. 

For them no more the whetstone's cheerful noise, 
No more the sun upon his daily course 

Shall watch them savouring the genial joys 
Of murder, bigamy, arson, and divorce. 

Here they all lie; and, as the hour is late, 
O stranger, o'er their tombstones cease to stoop, 

But bow thine ear to me and contemplate 

The unexpurgated annals of the group. . . 

Full many a vice is born to thrive unseen, 
Full many a crime the world does not discuss, 

Full many a pervert lives to reach a green 
Replete old age, and so it was with us. 

Doubtless in this neglected spot is laid 

Some village Nero who has missed his due, 

Some Bluebeard who dissected many a maid, 
And all for naught, since no one ever knew. 

Some poor bucolic Borgia here may rest 

\Vlmse poisons sent whole families to their doom, 

Some hayseed Herod who, within his breast, 
Concealed the sites of many an infant's tomb. 

Types that the Muse of Masefield might have stirred, 

Or waked to ecstasy Gaboriau, 
Each in his narrow cell at last intern-. I. 

All, all are sleeping peacefully below.

The Swinburne Legend 

THE LIFE OF ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE. By 
Edmund Gosse. (Macmillan Co.; $3.50.) 
It is probably wise for poets to die young. 
They are saved the ignominy of becoming fat and 
stolid, deaf and silent, self-centred and impolite. 
Their biographers escape the trouble of disinter- 
ring the good they did as well as of burying the 
immortal evil that lives after them. Young 
poets are personified romance; all their deeds 
wear the enchanting garments lent by distance 
and legend. Byron, despite the aching hearts 
dangling on his watch chain, will always be the 
idol of Youth ; Shelley's unquenchable idealism 
not only covers his few sins but actually explains 
the affair with Harriet; Keats's ashes rest in a 
Grecian urn, and already from the present chaos 
emerge the radiantly godlike figures of Rupert 
Brooke and Alan Seeger. Each has his legend 
and no amount of scholarship can dim its ra- 
diance. 

Swinburne, too, had his legend, based, for 
lack of a biography, almost entirely upon his 
poetry. To his youthful worshippers, beyond 
the sacred pale of London literary circles, the 
author of "Dplores" and "Faustine" and "Laus 
Veneris" was the most frankly sensual of all 
English poets, pagan, unorthodox, and uncon- 
ventional; a bit given to emphasizing the rap- 
tures and roses of vice rather than the languors 
and lilies of virtue. In spite of Buchanan's ac- 
cusation of more than spiritual plagiarism from 
Baudelaire, in his articles labelling the Pre- 
Raphaelites "The Fleshly School," Swinburne 
could not have lived a model Mid-Victorian ex- 
istence, said the youngsters. To his older, and 
perhaps wiser admirers, the author of "The 
Hymn of Man" and "The Garden of Proser- 
pine" was the poet of satiety and heresy, not 
pointing his moral, 'tis true, but adorning his 
tale most seductively. The greybeards could 
hardly argue that he had depended entirely upon 
vicarious experience for the genuine feeling of 
worldweariness in the latter and the blasphemies 
shouted from the former. But to both, old and 
young, the man was dangerously synonymous 
with the poet. It was even mouthed about, 
especially at the time of Watts-Dunton's death, 
that Swinburne's muse was not wholly indepen- 
dent of stimulants somewhat more worldly than 
the nectar and ambrosia of Olympus; and that 
only when the fires of youth had cooled and been 
most effectively banked by this very Watts- 
Dunton did babies' feet and sea shells assume 
their famous fascination. There was no unim- 
peachable authority for all this gossip, nor for 
the insistent hypothesis that the author of "Her- 
maphroditus" was not so angelic as his Pre- 
Raphaelite brothers had painted him. At any 



rate, it all kept Swinburne's legend alive, and 
his life tantalizingly interesting. 

Now comes Mr. Edmund Gosse's "Life of 
Algernon Charles Swinburne," pathetically at- 
tempting at one and the same time to invalidate 
our legend, or the profane legend evolved from 
the poetry, and to establish what to us is a new 
legend, the sacred legend of those who knew and 
loved Swinburne the man. It is no strain on 
one's mind or heart to appreciate Mr. Gosse's 
difficult position. He must serve God and Mam- 
mon. He was and is of those who wish Swin- 
burne were the "young Apollo" he looked, "if 
only the weak mouth and the receding chin 
could be ignored." And yet, as biographer, he 
feels he must serve Truth, this time unhappily, 
it seems, on the side of the profane legend. 
For despite all his honorable efforts, Swinburne, 
"our sad bad glad mad brother" peeps through, 
elfin and human. 

The sacred legend it was that made it possible 
for Lafcadio Hearn, in his Tokyo University 
lectures, about 1902, to say: "Swinburne is al- 
together an incomparably stronger character than 
Shelley. He kept his radicalism for his poetry, 
and never in any manner outraged the conven- 
tions of society in such matters as might relate 
to his private life. . . Shelley, for example, is 
a very chaste poet, there is not one improper 
line in the whole of his poetry; but his life was 
decidedly unfortunate. Exactly the reverse hap- 
pens in the case of Swinburne, who has written 
thousands of immoral lines." (The italics are 
mine!) And the contented and reassured re- 
viewer of this present volume, in the London 
"Times," puts on the finishing touch: "To treat 
Swinburne in an official manner would be like 
breaking a bird of Paradise on the wheel; and 
never for a moment has Mr. Gosse attempted to 
do so. There is a Swinburne legend which 
would have been killed [again the italics are 
mine] by an official biography, but Mr. Gosse 
authenticates it for us; he convinces us that our 
most delightful dreams about the poet were true, 
and that the truth is even better than the 
dreams." Wherein we see the Mid-Victorian 
still stalking abroad in our land. 

Mr. Gosse's volume is chronological and anec- 
dotal, there is hardly a page that is not enriched 
by some delightful incident or jest concerning 
Swinburne's time and associates. The famous 
controversies are all recorded; Algernon's child- 
ish recantation of his early admiration for 
Arnold, Whitman, and Whistler, is regretfully 
admitted and in the two latter cases successfully 
shifted to Watts-Dunton's shoulders; and his 
notorious worship of Hugo, Landor, and Maz- 
zini is faithfully described and explained. There 
is, however, little or no criticism of the poems 
and no attempt to supply what many readers

would have expected and wished for, a psycho- 
logical analysis or at least commentary on the 
poet's personality, such as might be used for 
a more complete understanding of his work. He 
skips and twitches, red-headed, through the 
pages, alternately raging mad and angelically 
quiet. But he does not live again. 

The reason for this, I think, will be found in 
Mr. Gossc's determination to maintain the con- 
spiracy of silence, at which he is only half 
successful. It is, for example, rather deadly to 
be assured that Swinburne was "largely intellec- 
tual in his rebellious attitude to society" and 
that "his attitude of complacency with even what 
might be called British prejudice" went so far as 
to deserve the term "Jingo patriotism." And 
interest or curiosity is goaded into irritation by 
the Muse of History "drawing a veil" whenever 
the biographer feels that the sacred legend is in 
danger. From Eton to Putney one comes upon 
these shiftings. At Eton "Swinburne had in- 
creasing trouble with Joynes [his tutor] of a 
rebellious kind and in consequence of some rep- 
resentations he did not return to Eton." "Re- 
bellious" is an innocent word, specific enough, 
but "representations" sounds strangely euphem- 
istical. One wonders. 

At Oxford "On one occasion when Dr. 
Acland was so kind as to read a paper on sew- 
age ( !) there was a scene over which the Muse 
of History must draw a veil"; "Swinburne's 
conduct became turbulent and unseemly, he was 
looked upon as 'dangerous' " ; "his extravagances 
were the cause of much annoyance to the au- 
thorities"; and he himself said: "My Oxonian 
career culminated in total and scandalous fail- 
ure." But as to what his conduct or extrava- 
gances even might have been one is left with 
hardly a hint. With his departure from Oxford 
and arrival in London the veil becomes an as- 
bestos curtain, retaining, however, the fatal 
peep-hole. 

Once the poet completely vanished . . . but on 
this occasion and on others of a more or less dis- 
tressing kind the prodigal was found and restored 
to his lodgings . . . but Swinburne fell into the 
hands of other and later associates whose company 
was not 'always of advantage to him. . . He 
seemed unable to resist succumbing to the most de- 
bilitating irregularities. . . Unfortunately, during 
the summer of 1870, in circumstances which were 
widely related at the time, he had a difference with 
the Committee of the Arts Club and he was asked 
to resign ; . . . for from this time forth the dis- 
crepancy between his behavior in London and in the 
country became more remarkable than ever. It is not 
necessary to dwell on much that was distressing and 
even alarming, in his town habits. . . In the early 
summer of 1871 his extravagances reduced him to 
such a state of health that his father carried him 
off to Holmwood. 

When he meets Oscar Wilde and records him as 
a "harmless young nobody" Mr. Gosse remarks: 



nlniTiH-N life at the time little can be 
recorded, and less that is agreeable," and the 
London record closes with the report that the 
'Months of August and September 1879 were 
the most deplorable in his whole career." 

These admissions, vague though they are and 
scattered through the volume, unfortunately 
leave the sacred legend a little porous. 
No morbid curiosity is needed, and were it 
needed Mr. Gosse himself excites it, to warrant 
the suspicion that Swinburne knew enough of 
wine, women, and song to supply him with at 
least part of the local color so lavishly and ac- 
curately used in his first "Poems and Ballads." 
One reads "Laus Veneris" and "Dolores" with 
quickened interest if with no more intimate 
knowledge. The feeling that Mr. Gosse has 
* < >nsciously eliminated many details that seemed 
to violate the sacred legend is further justified 
by one or two items which might otherwise have 
passed unnoticed. On page 319, in the first Ap- 
pendix, in a letter from Lord Redesdale one 
reads: "his hair was red, violent, aggressive red 
it was, unmistakable, unpoetical carrots"! On 
page 12 Mr. Gosse quotes the letter as reading: 
"red, violent, aggressive red it was, unmistak- 
able red, like burnished copper"!! Now the 
sacred legend has it that Swinburne's hair was an 
"aureole" ; obviously aureoles are not made from 
unpoetical carrots. That was a faux f>as on the 
part of Lord Redesdale. 

In a characteristic letter from George Moore, 
in Appendix III, one also finds an incident, and 
several lively comments on Swinburne and his 
work, which one instantly recognizes as not 
worthy of a place in the body of the book. Mr. 
Gosse quotes Mr. E. V. Lucas's "guarded and 
ironic sketch" in "The New Statesman" of 
March 25, 1916, and remarks that it "deserves 
close attention"; but he seems himself to have 
read it somewhat hastily, for he neglects, in a 
very witty and amusing description of a visit 
to "The Pines," this vivid and perhaps all too 
human picture of Swinburne: 

This, my first sight of Swinburne, I am not likely to 
forget, since various other preconceptions instantly 
crumbled away. For one thing, though he was as 
short as I had supposed, his body was by no means 
the inconsiderable affair that, from many testimonies, 
one had thought it. On the contrary, it was marked 
by solidity, and below the waist-line was not less 
ethereal than that of many a trencherman. . . His 
face, too, which was highly colored, bore further 
signs that materialistic interests were not outside his 
scheme of life ... his whole person was in- 
formed by prandial intentions. It had neither vivac- 
ity nor spiritual suggestion. . . What added the 
ultimate touch of unexpectedness was the fact that 
in his hand was a bottle of either beer or stout I 
forget which. Grasping this firmly in front of him 
the author of "Atalanta in Calydon" advanced to his 
chair at the dining table. . . From the careful 
way in which he poured the fluid from his cherished 



1917]

bottle, I gathered that that was his allowance and 
must be husbanded. 

And there will be few readers indeed who 
will finish this whole volume, and find, without 
surprise, that with the exception of one brief 
and unfortunate affair there is not one mention 
made nor hint given of love having entered Al- 
gernon Charles Swinburne's life! 

Mr. Gosse's work speaks from the atmosphere 
of .intimacy, and in that position one can sym- 
pathetically understand the instinctive "reticence, 
tact and diplomacy" for which the English re- 
viewers are so heartily praising him. But as. an 
"authentication" of the sacred legend the vol- 
ume is not wholly successful. For, in spite of 
biographer and reviewers, Swinburne wrote and 
was unashamed of that unique volume, the first 
series of "Poems and Ballads."

The Zemstvo 



SELF-GOVERNMENT IN RUSSIA. By Paul Vino- 
gradov. (E. P. Dutton & Co.; $1.50.) 

Americans were unprepared for, and surprised 
by, the Russian Revolution of last March. Then 
they were skeptical as to its success, for they 
imagined that disorganization must follow the 
overthrow of an autocratic government that had 
held a monopoly of the administration of the 
vast country for many generations. How 
could the peasants get along without their Lit- 
tle Father? Who would run the country now? 
The Duma had selected a Provisional Govern- 
ment from among its own members. The sol- 
diers and workmen of Petrograd had organized 
a Council of Delegates to control and assist the 
new administration. But what would happen 
in the rest of the country? 

Unfortunately the reports we have received 
of the progress of the Revolution have been con- 
fined for the most part to Petrograd and the sur- 
rounding districts. Moreover, the news from 
other parts of the country has touched par- 
ticularly on those elements working for disrup- 
tion which inevitably came to the surface at 
such a moment. But the predicted "breakdown" 
has not actually come. The Russian leaders 
themselves constantly spoke of impending dis- 
aster ; they were speaking, however, to their own 
people in an effort to secure greater unity and 
to discredit irresponsible agitators. But their 
statements seemed to justify the gloomiest ap- 
prehensions. 

Very quickly, however, and with remarkably 
little serious friction, the readjustment from au- 
tocratic rule to popular government took place. 
Within three months the food problem, which 
was the immediate cause of the Revolution but 



which was a question of distribution and not of 
actual supply, had become less acute. Within 
three months one heard that the army had been 
well equipped and that a Russian offensive was 
to be expected. The political crises that natur- 
ally accompanied the Revolution were safely 
weathered and a coalition cabinet was formed 
that united politically all classes. Only the 
workmen of factories in and around Petrograd 
were slow to fall into line, but Petrograd has 
always been the centre of intrigues. 

Americans wondered how the readjustment 
had been accomplished, for they had heard little 
of the ancient self-governing institutions of Rus- 
sia, which have been concealed by the bureau- 
cracy with its police and Cossack methods of 
governing. Americans knew little of the village 
system of Russia, by which the peasants, even 
in the times of serfdom, enjoyed a considerable 
measure of self-government. We were only 
vaguely aware of the existence of Zemstvos 
Russia's -elected local councils, which had been 
gradually taking over the functions of govern- 
ment. When the Revolution was announced 
from Petrograd, the Municipal Councils in all 
the large cities arrested, and then assumed the 
functions of, the local bureaucrats. As a matter 
of fact those functions had been little more than 
that of maintaining order, the local government 
bodies having already assumed government func- 
tions several months before the actual Revolu- 
tion. In the country districts the provincial 
councils formally announced what had been a 
fact for some time that they were the local 
authorities. By a simple order from the new 
Premier the five hundred Zemstvo presidents, the 
elected governors, replaced the "police" gov- 
ernors and their subordinates. In the villages 
the peasants simply drove out the police and as- 
sumed responsibility for public order, acting 
through their village assemblies and their elders. 
Within three months the peasantry of Russia 
was assembled in a representative Congress, reg- 
ularly elected through tlje already existing peas- 
ant self-governing bodies. 

Last summer I had occasion to show to an 
American visiting and studying Russia some- 
thing of the work of "self-governing" Russia. 
We went out to the rural districts, using the 
well-paved Zemstvo roads, visiting Zemstvo 
schools, inspecting model farms established by 
the Zemstvo of the district, and noting par- 
ticularly the hospitals equipped and conducted 
by the Zemstvo. We stepped into a cooperative 
store organized by the peasants on their own 
initiative, with some slight encouragement from 
the Zemstvo. The idea of cooperation is very 
strong among the peasants; for many years a 
communal system of land tenure was the pre- 
vailing tradition among the peasants of Great

Russia. After he had seen rural Russia and 
Zemstvo Russia, my friend was more ready to 
believe that another Russia would soon emerge. 
Until that trip he had known only bureaucratic 
Russia and the official Russia of Petrograd. 

The Revolution of last March was the work 
of Zemstvo Russia, supported by Municipal 
Russia and by the soldiers, workmen, and peas- 
ants. The soldiers were organized in their reg- 
iments. The peasants could act and speak 
through their village assemblies and also through 
the Zemstvo, on which they have their elected 
representatives. The workmen of Russia had 
suffered most under the arbitrary, bureaucratic 
police regime, and they had not been able to 
train themselves in local self-government. Con- 
sequently they have been slower to realize the 
responsibilities involved in the Revolution. The 
Zemstvo is the most vital of the self-government 
bodies of Russia. It was not by accident that 
the man selected to head the new government 
was Prince Lvov, the elected leader of Zemstvo 
Russia, the President of the "All-Russian Union 
of Zemstvos." 

In his short but excellent account of "Self- 
Government in Russia" Professor Vinogradov, 
writing before the Revolution, prophesies that 
"Russia is emerging from the background of 
Europe through self-government." Had we 
more generally known the facts given in this 
book, we should have understood how the Rev- 
olution came about and why it was so orderly 
and effective. The last phrase of the author 
has particular force just now. After summariz- 
ing what Russia has accomplished in the field 
of local self-government, he says: "No one will 
have the right to speak contemptuously hence- 
forth of the lack of initiative or the inability of 
the Russians to manage corporate affairs." 

SAMUEL N. HARPER. 



The Immanence of Dostoevsky 

THE ETERNAL HUSBAND. By Fyodor Dostoevsky. 
(Macmillan Co.; $1.50.) 

It is impossible not to think of Dostoevsky as 
a living author when his books come regularly, 
as they are coming, to the American public every 
few months. Our grandfathers sixty years ago 
are said to have lived their imaginative lives in 
anticipation of the next instalment of Dickens 
or Thackeray. I can feel somewhat of the same 
excitement in this Dostoevsky stream, though I 
cannot pretend that the great Russian will ever 
become a popular American classic. Yet in the 
progress from Dickens to Dostoevsky there is a 
symbol of the widening and deepening of the 
American imagination. We are adrift on a far 
wider sea than our forefathers. We are far 



more adventurous in personal relations, far more 
aware of the bewildering variousness of human 
nature. If you have once warmed to Dostoev- 
sky, you can never go back to the older classic 
fiction on which we were brought up. The 
lack of nuance, the hideous normality, of its 
people begins to depress you. When once you 
have a sense of the illusion of "character," when 
once you have felt the sinister, irrational turn <>t 
human thoughts, and the subtle interplay of 
impression and desire, and the crude impinge- 
ment of circumstance, you find yourself unless 
yeu keep conscious watch feeling a shade of 
contempt for the Scott and Balzac and Dickens 
and Thackeray and Trollope who were the au- 
thoritative showmen of life for our middle-class 
relatives. You relegate such fiction to the level 
of "movie" art, with its clean, pigeonholed cate- 
gories of the emotions, and its "registering" of 
a few simple moods. 

You will, of course, be wrong in any such 
contempt, because these novelists show a bewild- 
ering variety of types and a deep intuition of the 
major movements of the soul. Dickens teems 
with irrational creatures, with unconventional 
levels of life. But you can scarcely contradict 
me when I say that neither Dickens nor his 
readers ever forgot that these human patterns 
were queer. His appeal lies exactly in the joy- 
ful irrelevance with which we take all these 
lapses from the norm, in the pitiful tears which 
we can shed for human beings done so obvioush 
as they should not be done by. In reading these 
familiar novelists we never lose our moral land- 
marks. No matter how great the deviations a 
character shows, we are alwa\^ conscious or 
could be conscious if we liked of the exact 
amount of that deviation. The charm of that 
nineteenth-century fiction, as in the work of be- 
lated Victorians like Mr. Chesterton, lay in that 
duality between the sane and the insane, the 
virtuous and the villainous, the sober and the 
mischievous, the responsible and the irrespon- 
sible. There was no falsification in this. These 
novelists were writing for an epoch that really 
had stable "character," standards, morals, that 
consistently saw the world in a duality of body 
and spirit. They were a reflection of a class that 
really had reticences, altruisms, and religious 
codes. 

Dostoevsky appeals to us to-day because we 
arc trying to close up that dualism. And our 
appreciation of him and the other modern Rus- 
sians is a mark of how far we have actually gone. 
It is still common to call this fiction unhealthy, 
morbid, unwholesome. All that is meant by this 
is that the sudden shock of a democratic, unified, 
intensely feeling and living outlook is so severe 
to the mind that thinks in the old dual terms 
as to be almost revolting. What becomes more 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



25 



and more apparent to the readers of Dostoevsky, 
however, is his superb modern healthiness. He 
is healthy because he is not afraid of life as it 
is actually lived, in its unsatisfactoriness and its 
aspiration and its queer blindnesses. He is 
healthy because he has no sense of any dividing 
line between the normal and the abnormal, or 
even between the sane and the insane. I call 
this healthy because it is so particularly salutary 
for our American imagination to be jolted out 
of its stiltedness and preconceived notions of 
human psychology. I admit that the shock is 
somewhat rough and rude. "The Idiot," which 
I have read only once, remains in my mind as a 
stream of fairly incomprehensible people and un- 
intelligible emotional changes. Yet I feel that 
when I read it again I shall understand it. For 
Dostoevsky has a strange, intimate power which 
breaks in your neat walls and shows you how 
much more subtle and inconsequent your flowing 
life is than even your introspection had thought. 
But for all his subtlety he is the reverse of any- 
thing morbidly introspective. He is introspection 
turned inside out. For self-analysis is only tor- 
turing and unhealthy when you are conscious of 
an I which analyzes a Me. But suppose you can 
merge the I and the Me so that you get the full 
warm unity of emotional life without losing any 
of the detail of the understanding analysis of the 
soul. 

This astounding mergence Dostoevsky actually 
seems to achieve. This is what gives him the 
intimate power which distinguishes every story 
of his from anything else you ever read. Again 
he contrasts with the classical novelists. For 
they are quite palpably outside their subjects. 
You are never unaware of the author as telling 
the story. He has always the air of the show- 
man, unrolling his drama before your eyes. His 
characters may be infinitely warm and human, 
but the writer himself is somehow not in them. 
"Wuthering Heights" is the only story I think 
of that has something of this fierce, absorbed in- 
tensity of Dostoevsky's. In the great Russian 
you lose all sense of the showman. The writer 
is himself the story; he is inextricably in it. In 
stories like "The Double" or "A Gentle Spirit," 
in this volume, immanence could go no further. 
The story seems to tell itself. Its strange, 
breathless intimacy of mood follows faithfully 
every turn and quirk of thought and feeling. Its 
tempo is just of that inner life we know, with its 
ceaseless boring into the anxious future and its 
trails of the unresolved past. These stories fol- 
low just that fluctuating line of our conscious 
life with its depressions and satisfactions, its 
striving always for a sense of control, its uneasi- 
ness. In Dostoevsky's novels it is not only the 
author that is immanent. The reader also is 
absorbed. After reading "Crime and Punish- 



ment" you are yourself the murderer. For days 
the odor of guilt follows you around. The ex- 
travaganza of "The Double" pursues you like 
a vivid dream of your own. 

All of Dostoevsky's qualities are in this latest 
volume, "The Eternal Husband." But so con- 
centrated are they that the Dostoevsky novice 
would better begin with that poignant, but less 
extravagant, story, "The Insulted and Injured," 
or that epic of frustrated aspiration, "The 
Brothers Karamazov." The first story in this 
new volume is about a man who is eternally 
doomed to be a cuckold, and is told by one of 
the dead wife's lovers. The poor husband has 
neither the strength of revenge nor the stolidity 
of adjustment, and pursues a frantic course be- 
tween them. He is so much a victim that his 
utter debasement takes on a pathetic irony which 
is the more vivid for the impersonal, reliant 
scorn of the narrating lover. Mr. William Lyon 
Phelps is said to find humor in the book, but it 
is only the mirthless humor of irony that is all 
through Dostoevsky's work. 

The second story, "The Double," is an amaz- 
ing record of the feverish rush of a mind on* the 
borderline of insanity. Yet it is so human in its 
subtle tracing of the weary mind trying to catch 
up with a world which ever grows too much for 
it, that we take it not as a pathological incident 
but as a deep poem of the human spirit. This 
is somehow ourselves in our uncomfortable col- 
lisions with the world. We understand anew 
that sanity is merely a matter of keeping our 
vagaries hidden. The third story, "A Gentle 
Spirit," tells of a sinister marriage and the de- 
struction of a girl's soul by a man, not through 
malice but through sheer ineptness. The analysis 
is amazing, the husband's clutching justification 
of his attitude, which he knows is wrong, the 
fatal conflict between his habit-will and his 
generous inclinations. 

Such stories, however fantastic the problems 
of the soul, get deeply into us. We cannot 
ignore them, we cannot take them irresponsibly. 
We cannot read them for amusement, or even 
in detachment, as we can our classics. We 
forget our categories, our standards, our notions 
of human nature. All we feel is that we are 
tracing the current of life itself. Dostoevsky is 
so much in his stories that we get no sense of 
his attitude toward his characters or of his crit- 
icism of life. Yet the after-impression is one 
of rich kindness, born of suffering and imperfec- 
tion, and of a truly religious reverence for all 
living experience. Man as a being with his feet 
in the mud and his gaze turned toward the stars, 
yet always indissolubly one in feet and eyes and 
heart and brain! If we are strong enough to 
hear him, this is the decisive force we need on our 
American creative outlook.

CASUAL, COMMI v i 

THE COMMENCEMENTS OF 1917 have taken 
on a tone of their own. Previous Junes ha\r 
brought forth conventional essays and orations 
about the "struggle" and the "conflict" from 
students, and perfunctory expressions of good 
will and good hope from presidents, principals, 
and headmasters. This season our youths have 
been taking their degrees and diplomas in khaki 
or other significant uniform; and the observa- 
tions and admonitions of their instructors have 
exhibited both the actuality of the familiar 
struggle and the scant lapse of time between the 
departure from the academic atmosphere and the 
entrance into conflict in real and literal earnest. 
Elder men have set forth the gratitude due the 
country for opportunities and privileges enjoyed, 
and younger men have soberly acknowledged the 
obligation and have promptly set about to dis- 
charge it. Education, whatever its previous 
shortcomings in regard to a coordination of the 
nation's energies and aspirations and to a revival 
of the ancient pieties and immemorial decorums, 
has* advanced greatly toward the goal during the 
month just ending. 



A NEW IDEA IN BOOK-SELLING comes from a 
department-store is Des Moines, which, in or- 
der to render its staff of salesmen more alert and 
better informed, has prepared for their study a 
list of two-hundred-and-odd questions relating to 
their stock in particular and to the literary sit- 
uation in general. A dozen of these items, taken 
decimally, will serve to indicate what the Per- 
fect Salesman should know: 

Name three famous cartoonists, and state 
what works of each of these we have in stock. 
What was Booth Tarkington's last book? 
How does Hugo differ from Balzac and 
Dumas? Name an important book by each. 
What have you in stock for a child three 
years old? For a child twelve years old? 
How many books in the Elsie Series? 
Name three books in stock for children about 
five years old, costing from $1.50 to $2.50. 
What is blank verse? 
Is James Whitcomb Riley still living? 
What did he write? 

Has Lord Dunsany a forthcoming book? 
What is the latest edition of Holt's "Care 
and Feeding of Children"? 

Have you a medical dictionary? Is it re- 
cent ? Authentic ? 

Have you a book of instruction for wait- 
resses? 

And so on, down to items 226 and 227, which 
are: "Can you make five suggestions for the 
betterment of the department in general?" and. 
"Tell what they are and ho\v thev will improve 



our service or increase business." Says the in- 
genious manager of the book department and 
author of this new "booksellers' school": "Al- 
though we have been using these questions only 
about a month, 1 have noticed not only an in- 
creased alertness on the part of the clerks, but 
also a desire to know more about the publica- 
tions they are selling or hope to sell in the 
future." Book-buying in Des Moines ought to 
be a real pleasure.

THE EFFECT OF THE WAR ON THE READING 

OF BOOKS receives a side-lighting from an article 
by an English publisher which recently appeared 
in the "Publisher's Weekly." The writer is of 
course young, or he would have remained silent ; 
and of course successful, or no paean would have 
ensued. He seems to have been successful be- 
cause he took a sound line and stuck close to it. 
He waived aside the notion that for a time people 
would not read. How, in fact, could a non- 
reading civilized world be, in any circumstances, 
conceived ? L'appetit vlent en mangeant. The 
mental stomach, distended by the long habit of 
reading, cannot but continue to call for the sus- 
tenance of the printed sheet. It may call for 
sustenance different in nature, but not less in 
amount. Our publisher chose his books with an 
eye to current conditions; the usual demand 
would be modified in character by the experi- 
ences through which England was passing. He 
printed larger editions, advertised more widely, 
pushed along his "travellers" more vigorously, 
and won out. Reading is the modern refuge 
and the modern dissipation ; and, with so many 
of the more elaborate and more expensive forms 
of indulgence curtailed or suppressed, it is likely, 
under intelligent guidance, fully to hold its own. 



NEW COMPETITION FOR THE NOVELIST, al- 
ready harassed and hardpressed, is threatened. 
Time was when he had to struggle only against 
his contemporaries, native and foreign, against 
the classics established in previous centuries, and 
against the creators of recently expired copy- 
rights with their concomitants of library "sets" 
manufactured and vended as mere merchandise. 
The dead were dead, and save for a too abun- 
dant reproduction of their words were silent. 
There was a time when, if the brains were out 

. . But that condition no longer obtains. 
Even the dead seem to have regained the creative 
plane and to show a disposition toward acti\r 
competition with the living. For example, here 
comes "Patience Worth." Once she was content 
with writing bits of verse and of homily. Hut 
now. .uvonling to announcement, she is bringing 
out a novel one of 300,000 words. Like her 
other work, it comes to our mundane circles via

the ouija board all its vast expressiveness hav- 
ing been laboriously spelled out by the Mrs. Cur- 
ran who has acted on previous occasions. The 
ghostly romancer has chosen for her period the 
early years of our era, and for her title, "A Sorry

the Crucifixion. It is said also that a second 
novel, "A Merry Tale," descriptive of life in 
"Patience's" own period, the seventeenth century, 
has progressed already beyond 20,000 words. 
But, after all, is the novelty, however great, com- 
plete? Does it come unique and virginal? There 
was Coleridge, who "did not write 'Kubla 
Khan,' >: but only "wrote it down." Yet 
"Alph, the sacred river," however mysterious its 
course, never "ran" to 300,000 words. 



A SIGNIFICANT COMPARISON is drawn by Mr. 
John Cotton Dana in his latest report of the 
Newark, N. J., Public Library. That library, 
with its nine branches and its many departments 
of activity and usefulness, costs its community 
$150,000 a year. With this income it puts into 
circulation more than a million books, receives 
and, if desired, ministers to more than a million 
visitors, and provides facilities for the same num- 
ber of readers in its reference department; also 
it buys nearly 30,000 new books in the same 
annual period, receives 1,200 periodicals, main- 
tains a clipping bureau and a large picture col- 
lection, houses the Newark Museum, sends out 
more than three hundred class-room libraries, an- 
swers seven thousand telephone calls for informa- 
tion, gives instruction in the use of its facilities, 
and does much else of a useful nature besides 
and all, be it noted again, on $150,000 a year. 
The public schools, which offer service to a much 
smaller portion of the community call for an 
annual expenditure of more than three million 
dollars, even though the parochial and other non- 
public schools of the city care for eighteen thou- 
sand pupils at no expense to the municipality. 
A striking comparison, or contrast, might also 
have been drawn between the modest annual 
sum spent on the library and that required to 
maintain the police force and the municipal 
courts. Not long ago a city alderman in a west- 
ern state where strikes had been prevalent urged 
that the customary library appropriation be used 
for additional police service, on the ground that 
abstention from reading would be preferable to 
a reign of crime. Curiously enough, a newspaper 
of a neighboring city (where strike riots had 
actually occurred) was at the same time urging 
an increase in the library appropriation because 
"books are better than policemen under such con- 



ditions." It is safe to say that the public library 
is in no danger of apoplexy from too generous 
feeding at the public crib. 



LIGHT FROM THE EAST, and light on the 
East, such is the double promise conveyed by 
the announcement of the founding of an English 
weekly review in Shanghai. The new publica- 
tion will be known as "Millard's Review," and 
will be edited and published by Thomas F. Mil- 
lard, known for years as a war correspondent 
of American newspapers and magazines, and 
more recently as editor of the "China Press" 
and author of books dealing with questions be- 
tween the Far East and the United States. The 
East promises or threatens to loom still big- 
ger within the next few years, and any aid ex- 
plaining the Orient to the Occident and tending 
to bring about better relations between the two 
cannot but be welcome.

DISCOVERING THE PRESENT. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

An unexpected result of this flood of war is 
our willing confinement to the present. Before 
August, 1914 we had a genial interest in the books 
and men of the past; for many of us their appeal 
was so stirring that they constituted our true 
spiritual life. The present had indeed its legitimate 
place in our hearts. Shaw, Wells, Chesterton 
could not fail to fascinate us, and Brieux, France, 
Bergson, Maeterlinck, Ibsen, d'Annunzio from 
abroad proved for us the immortal vitality of lit- 
erature. In art futurism shouted rebellion against 
the primacy of beauty. In science improvement 
followed improvement in the tools and materiel of 
civilization. Political history had its perennial in- 
terest. We read eagerly of Lloyd George and the 
lords, of French conservatism hoping much from 
President Poincare, of blustering Prussian officers 
abusing cobblers in Alsace who could not forget 
la France, of the scholar-president of the greatest 
republic and his zeal for democracy, of wretched 
Mexico sunken in feuds. 

This present was ours and we were glad to be 
alive in it; but it was not the capital fact in our 
lives. The present was simply a half-century which 



28 



THE DIAL 



[June 28 



we beheld in the flesh. Our hearts and minds 
dwelt in the past and drew their nourishment from 
its great names and achievements. The French 
revolutionists and their forerunners who fought 
for Reason, the urban literature of the grand 
siicle, the poetic civilization of the Middle Ages, 
the human Italians of the Renaissance, the deeps 
we sounded with Plato, Dante, Shakespeare, Kant, 
Goethe, the heavenly beauty that Greek, Latin, 
Saxon, and Arab had put upon earth, the whole 
treasure of England, mother of our culture these, 
and much else of the past, were our favored inter- 
ests. We meant to be the contemporaries of all 
humanity, and to choose the time as well as the 
place of our residence among men. 

But the present has become hypnotically, mag- 
netically insistent, and the past has gone clean out 
of our minds. It has become a memory, put away 
from everyday thinking, like early happenings in 
our lives still possessing some influence but not 
often the object of our attention. We shall never 
again live and think as we did before August, 
1914; our interests have veered too far from 
where they were. Who will read the old books 
again without this war's ideas for the guide of his 
reaction? Who will write again, who will cher- 
ish and practise culture without the apostasy of 
Germany in mind? The present has conquered us 
all. Whatever we do and think of moment dur- 
ing this generation will come from this tremendous 
battle for Right. The world is born again, and 
we are the first who shall speak and act in the new 
age to be! It is a rare privilege thus to live in 
the youth of a period, and to be something more 
than its late-born commentators. 

GEORGE A. UNDERWOOD. 

Smith College, June 2O, 



MR. DREISER AND "CELESTINA." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
May I ask for space in your columns to thank 
Mr. Louis How for so courteously calling my at- 
tention (in THE DIAL of May 31) to the old 
Spanish dramatic novel "Celestina," which he 
thinks offers a parallel to Mr. Dreiser's device of 
shifting the scene from speech to speech in his 
plays. In a review of Mr. Dreiser's plays I had 
rashly remarked that, so far as I knew, this de- 
vice was new even in closet drama. In the face 
of Solomon and his successors (among whom Mr. 
How will surely forgive me for ranking him) it 
is always highly indiscreet to say that anything is 
new. When I made the remark, I was not think- 
ing of mediaeval drama, in which various places 
were represented simultaneously on the stage; I 
was thinking of modern drama, of which Mr. 
Dreiser's plays are very interesting examples. If 
Mr. How wished to attack my obiter dictum on 
the ground that mediirval dramatists seem to use 
something like Mr. Dreiser's device, he might have 
found much better examples than "Celestina." For, 
in the first place, it is perhaps worth noting that 
the classification of "Celestina" is doubtful. The 
balance of authority, so far as I can discover, seems 
to favor classifying it as a novel rather than as a 



pl;i\. Thus Fit/mauricc Kelly ("A Histoi 
Spanish Literature/ Nrw York, 1902, p. 125) 
: "This remarkable book . . . has been 
classed as a play, or as a novel in dialogue. . . 
Its influence is most marked on the novel." Martin 
Hume ("Spanish Influence on English Literature," 
London, 1905) discusses "Celestina" in his chapter 
on the novel, and says (p. 249), "It was, to all 
intents and purposes, a novel in dramatic form." 
Professor Ward ("History of English Dramatic 
Literature," I, 232) calls it "a dramatic novel of 
intrigue and character." Mr. How need have 
gone no further than the English miracle plays 
to find examples of the kind of apparent shifting 
of scene from speech to spcch which he refers to 
in "Celestina." And these examples would have 
served his purpose better, because they occur in 
undoubted acting plays. 

But neither "Celestina" nor any other mediaeval 
drama, so far as I know, really offers a fair par- 
allel to Mr. Dreiser's kaleidoscopic scene shifts. 
The mediaeval stage made use of what is now 
called "multiple setting," that is (I quote Professor 
Thorndike's "Shakespeare's Theatre," p. 11), "in 
general the medieval performance . . . repre- 
sented different places at the same time by means 
of properties, and used the neutral unpropertied 
space to represent all other places." It is only 
from our modern point of view that the scene 
seems to shift from speech to speech as we read 
these plays; really the several scenes were all rep- 
resented simultaneously by the "multiple setting." 
The contemporary reader of a piece like "Celes- 
tina" would read with this "multiple setting" stage 
in mind, and what seem to us shifts of scene would 
mean to him merely changes from one "station" 
on the stage to another, such as he had often wit- 
nessed in acted drama. He would have all the 
scenes before his mind's eye all the time, so that no 
mental readjustment would be necessary when the 
action or dialogue moved to a different "station." 
The reader of closet drama to-day reads with our 
"single setting" stage in mind ; and each shift of 
scene will involve for him a mental readjustment. 
When Mr. Dreiser takes him in successive speeches 
from Mrs. Delavan's kitchen to her front yard, 
and then to the cab of a locomotive a hundred miles 
away, he is likely to be confused and wearied by 
the rapid imaginative readjustments necessary; at 
the very least, his attention will be distracted from 
the action and main business of the play. And this, 
I still believe, is a source of fatal weakness. 

Finally, I cannot refrain from remarking that 
in his anxiety properly to castigate my ignorance, 
Mr. How extravagantly overestimates the literary 
value of "Celestina." Historically, of course, its 
importance is very great, and intrinsically its merit 
is considerable; but to call it. as Mr. How does, 
"one of the few most alive of the supreme works 
of art Europe has produced" is to give it equal rank 
with the Iliad, the Divine Comedy, and Hamlet. 
I am sorry to have been the unwitting occasion of 
anyone's making so serious a critical blunder.

BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS 



PICTURES OF WAR WORK IN ENGLAND. By 

Joseph Pennell. Lippincott; $1.50. 

Mr. Pennell may always be counted upon to 
lay his finger upon the significant aspects of what- 
ever he chooses as subject for his pencil. Where 
most artists have the "seeing eye" only for the 
decorative, Mr. Pennell's sense of selection is of 
a different order; with him beauty and human ac- 
tivity are interdependent, and of recent years he 
has never given us an impression of beauty as the 
artist in him sees it, without also giving us a 
very powerful comment on life as the caustic-witted 
philosopher in him sees it. In the present volume 
of drawings he has laid his finger upon the one 
outstanding feature of the present war its indus- 
trial ramifications. Looking over these drawings, 
all of which have that feeling of "sociological 
beauty" which characterizes his work, one be- 
comes conscious of the absence of human beings. 
These are drawings of machines, of factories, of 
furnaces, and wherever human beings appear, they 
are grimy dregs scattered like coal dust entirely 
without significance. That is his interpretation 
of the present war a battle of the mechanical 
Genii which have been evolved by human ingenuity, 
now become our masters and destroyers. This 
interpretation is borne out by the brusque words 
commenting upon each drawing. There is much 
in this volume which it would be well for every 
American to ponder. 

AN UNCENSORED DIARY. By Ernesta Drinker 
Bullitt. Doubleday, Page; $1.25. 
JOURNAL OF SMALL THINGS. By Helen Mac- 
Kay. Duffield; $1.35. 

Two diaries of the war recently published, both 
by women, suggest many ideas concerning the art 
of the diarist, particularly the attitude of the 
writer toward his record. The first of these 
diaries, "An Uncensored Diary," is intended to be 
no more than an objective account of incidents, 
persons, and impressions, written with a definite 
public in mind. As a piece of journalistic record 
it is interesting. The second diary, Helen Mac- 
kay's "Journal of Small Things," possesses the 
subtle charm of the diary in its highest form. 
Something of the intimate mood inspiring this 
record is expressed in the opening lines: "I have 
so strange a feeling, a sense of its being the end 
of things. The end of I don't know what. I 
want to make note of things, not of the great 
things that are happening, but of the little things. 
I want to feel especially all the little everyday dear 
accustomed things, to take hold of the moods of 
them, and gather up their memories, to be put 
away and kept, and turned back to always after- 
ward." It is easy to see, and remember, the big 
things; it is not until it is too late that we realize 
that the small details, the seemingly unessential, 
were the significant and precious things of bygone 
days. In these pages one follows the changes since 
1914 the first spectral rumors that penetrated the 
old chateau, the futile attempts to discredit the 
reports, the clinging to the old, secure serenity of 



peace, the bewildered abandonment of all that was 
familiar, the calm acceptance of the unrealities of 
war, the unconscious adjustments. This is the 
record of a spiritual development, and it is by far 
the most impressive, the most poignant which this 
reviewer has yet found in the mass of war litera- 
ture. It is a volume to be read and reread, and 
always to be kept near at hand. 

INSIDE THE GERMAN EMPIRE. By Herberc 

Bayard Swope. Century; $2. 

No reader of this excellent book will be sur- 
prised to know that it has been given the $1000 
Pulitzer Prize for the best piece of reporting done 
during the year. Mr. Swope is more than a good 
reporter. He has performed a statesmanlike serv- 
ice in putting before American readers a fair- 
minded analysis of the attitude of the German 
people toward the outside world in this momentous 
time. Especially interesting just now is Mr. 
Swope's description of the feeling toward peace. 
He is quite sure that the German people want 
peace. He believes that they are tired of war and 
ready to forego some of their earlier hopes. He 
does not think, however, that any important class 
in Germany would accept peace on ignominious 
terms; and he therefore concludes that few be- 
lieve it will soon come. For instance, the Ger- 
mans to a man are determined to oppose the 
cession of Alsace-Lorraine to France. Regarding 
Belgium there is a divided opinion, but Mr. Swope 
believes that the majority of enlightened Germans 
favors the reestablishment of the neighbor king- 
dom. 

In this connection, it is a little surprising to 
find Mr. Swope declaring that Germans do not 
underestimate the danger of their position, that 
they realize that if the war is carried to the end, 
they must lose. Their main hope, he says, lies in 
two possibilities first, in the defection of Russia, 
and second, in the liberalizing of the German Em- 
pire. The first is the more pleasing prospect to 
Germans. (This was before the Russian Revolu- 
tion.) They have an interesting theory that 
Russia may be drawn away from the Entente, and 
with Japan, who is supposed to hate America, join 
Germany against the coming Anglo-American alli- 
ance. Mr. Swope himself, however, seems more 
interested in the liberal movement already under 
way among thinking Germans. The main objec- 
tion to its potency as a peace factor, he thinks, is 
the belief among Germans that it would appear 
to be forced upon them by a victorious enemy. 
They are therefore careful to state that the change 
is to come after the war. Mr. Swope feels safe in 
saying, however, that the movement for a respon- 
sible popular government may gain ascendency be- 
fore peace arrives. 

One is tempted to quote freely from such a 
book. It is better, however, to recommend it 
heartily to the reader. It covers much more 
ground than this review has touched, and it gives 
Americans a view of the German people, which 
in vision, lack of bias, and kindly feeling could 
hardly be surpassed.

BEETHOVEN. By Remain Holland. Trans- 
lated by A. Eaglefield Hull. Holt; $1.50. 
When M. Holland writes of music or musicians, 
one expects a treat ; and with Beethoven as a sub- 
ject to inspire, one expects a great treat. After 
arousing such anticipations, the present volume 
is rather a disappointment; of its 244 pages only 
54 are given to M. Holland's sketch of the com- 
poser's life. As a character study it is far from 
satisfying, containing nothing new in fact or inter- 
pretation. The rest of the book seems like too 
evident an attempt to fill up space, good as part of 
the material is. The most interesting section is an 
analysis of Beethoven's symphonies, sonatas, and 
string quartets, the work of Dr. Hull. The chief 
value of the book is as an introduction to the study 
of Beethoven, and in this respect the copy of his 
will, a selection of his letters, a bibliography, and 
the complete list of his compositions are useful. 

GREATER ITALY. By William Kay Wallace. 

Scribner; $2.50. 

Events of a decade preceding the world war 
pointed to Italy as the European nation whose 
ambition ran most frankly in the direction of ter- 
ritorial expansion; and it was primarily to gain 
territory that the kingdom, after long wavering, 
broke with its allies and entered the present con- 
flict. In his "Greater Italy" Mr. Wallace traces 
the Italian expansionist movement from its mid- 
century beginnings to the year 1917, and in doing 
so he describes the forces working to produce the 
original unification of the country and sketches 
the whole sweep of Italian political history since 
the rise of Cavour. The Italy which the world 
best knows is the Italy of intellect, of art, of re- 
ligion, of literature, of romance. Mr. Wallace 
portrays the Italy of politics, of diplomacy, of war, 
of realism. His task has been attempted before, 
with much success by King and Okey and by Un- 
derwood. But the developments of the past two 
years afford excellent opportunity to paint the pic- 
ture afresh and on a larger canvas. For Italy's 
part in the present struggle, the author finds pe- 
culiar historical justification. The Italians, in his 
opinion, are the people who "blazed the trail of 
national, racial unity, and set the world thinking 
along the lines of nationality"; and the European 
war "is a struggle for the preservation of this 
principle." Italy's own immediate object is to gain 
for herself the Trentino, Trieste, and every re- 
maining* part of Italia irredenta, so that she may 
attain a fulness of national and racial unity which 
the events of 1859-66 denied her. This is not 
materialism or sordid aggrandizement. It is not 
merely square miles of land, larger resources, more 
material for armies, and more taxpayers that the 
kingdom is fighting for; she is fighting for the 
right of the large Italian populations on her bor- 
ders to become again a part of their own people, 
and for equivalent rights for Poles and Serbs and 
every broken and divided people of Europe. Mr. 
Wallace has spent some time with the troops on 
the various Italian fronts, and he describes in lucid 
and restrained manner the difficulties and triumphs 
of the operations against the Austrians. His book 



IN well written, although there is an occasional in- 
exact statement. It would be truer, for example, 
to say of the papal Non Expedit that Pius X made 
provision for occasional suspension of the decree 
rather than that he "withdrew it." 

THE PUBLIC DEFENDER. By Mayer C. Gold- 
man. Putnam; $1. 

One of the many points at which we have 
awakened to the inadequacy of our historic in- 
stitutions reveals itself in the growing conscious- 
ness of the need for reform of our criminal laws. 
Their roots lie far back in mediaeval history, and 
there has been too little overhauling of them in 
recent times to meet the growing needs of our 
complex social, economic, and political life. One 
of the more promising attacks upon the problem 
of criminal procedure within the last few years has 
been the growing demand for a public defender, 
whose duties would be complementary to those of 
the public prosecutor. That the old system of 
leaving the defendant to depend wholly upon paid 
or assigned counsel is unfair to those with limited 
means is made quite clear by Mr. Goldman. 
Equally well does he make his point that, con- 
trary to the opinion of some enthusiasts, the public 
prosecutor is not in a position to perform ade- 
quately the functions of attorney for the prosecu- 
tion and for the defence. Besides the benefits which 
should accrue to the defendant from the services of 
the public defender, there are also some conspic- 
uous civic advantages. Mr. Goldman calls attention 
especially to the fact that chicanery and manu- 
factured defences will be decreased. Unfair dis- 
crimination would be eliminated through having 
the state officially concerned in the defence; there 
would be less likelihood of cases dragging out in- 
definitely on technicalities. At the same time in- 
vestigation of evidence should be facilitated, trial 
expenses decreased, the morale of the courts im- 
proved, and popular respect for our machinery of 
justice increased. Mr. Goldman writes his book 
as a partisan of the movement. In fact, this mon- 
ograph came out of his practical labors on com- 
mittees and in other publicity efforts on behalf of 
the movement. A valuable feature of the book is 
an appendix giving the chronology of the movement 
in this country and setting forth the most impor- 
tant facts regarding its present employment. 

THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND NAPOLEON. 

By Charles Downer Hazen. Holt; $2.50. 

In this volume Professor Hazen has brought to- 
gether, "for the convenience of those who may 
wish to review this memorable and instructive pe- 
riod," the chapters dealing with it in his "Modern 
European History," a book recently prepared for 
use in college classes. For general readers whose 
interest in history has been stimulated by the 
Great War, no period of the past is better worth 
attention. The revolutionary and Napoleonic wars 
not only offer many striking analogies with the 
present conflict, but they furnish the necessary 
starting point, unless one is prepared to begin with 
the Roman Empire, for any historical explanation 
of the present situation. From 1793 to 1815,

France was almost constantly at war with one or 
more of the European states. When invaded, 
France professed to be fighting for independence; 
when success carried her arms abroad, she often 
announced herself the predestined bearer of a 
superior civilization to backward peoples. The al- 
lied monarchies of Europe, on the other hand, con- 
ceiving themselves defending the cause of law and 
order and the rights of nations, srball and great, 
professed their intentions to continue the struggle 
until they had obtained adequate guarantees for 
the future, until they had destroyed, not France 
or the French people indeed, but the intolerable 
menace of the French revolutionary spirit. For 
Americans, this conflict derives an added signifi- 
cance from the fact that for twenty years the 
United States, endeavoring at once to maintain her 
neutrality and to protect her rights, suffered every 
humiliation, resorted to every measure short of 
war, and at last, in 1812, waged with England the 
war sometimes called the second war of indepen- 
dence. 

If the period presents many analogies with the 
present, the differences were also striking. The 
United States was then a weak and divided nation 
just entering upon the great experiment in democ- 
racy. The civilization which France was endeavor- 
ing alternately to defend and to impose on Europe 
was inspired, in theory if not always in practice, 
by the democratic ideals of Liberty, Equality, and 
Fraternity; while the Allied Powers proved in the 
end to be the champions of dynasties rather than of 
nations and of autocracy rather than of law. The 
political history of Europe in the nineteenth cen- 
tury issues directly from that great conflict, and 
centres in the irreconcilable opposition between lib- 
eralism and reaction. Suffering many reverses, 
the forces of liberalism and democracy triumphed 
in the main; so that to-day France, still faithful 
to her ancient faith, stands forth the heroic 
champion of established ideas; and the better part 
of Europe, joined at last by the United States, has 
rallied about her for the suppression of Prussian- 
ism, the last stronghold of reaction and the forces 
of unreason. 

The great conflict of a century ago, so similar 
in some respects, yet so different in others, from 
the present conflict, Professor Hazen has por- 
trayed with admirable skill. It may be that he has 
not fully appreciated the emotional and religious 
spirit of eighteenth century thought, that ideal of 
civic virtue, the ideal precisely of Fraternite, which 
inspired in part at least the anti-Christian movement 
of 1793. It may be that more space might well 
have been given to the constructive work of the 
Revolution and of Napoleon, although these have 
by no means been ignored. But on the whole the 
period is presented in excellent perspective; the 
great facts stand out clearly and in proper rela- 
tion. And the story is told in a way that carries 
the reader along with unflagging interest, in a 
style distinguished by clarity, movement, and a cer- 
tain individual quality. You feel that the book 
was written by somebody. 



NOTES FOR BIBLIOPHILES 



[Inquiries or contributions to this department should be ad- 
dressed to John E. Robinson, the Editor, who will be 
pleased to render to readers such services as are possible.] 



A very rare Charles Dickens item was sold re- 
cently by Scott & O'Shaughnessy at the Collectors' 
Club, 30 East 42nd Street, New York. It was 
the "Public Life of Mr. Tulrumble, once Mayor 
of Mudfog, and Oliver Twist, or The Parish 
Boy's Progress, By Boz," sexto decimo, original 
pink wrappers, uncut, as issued, New York, pub- 
lished by C. Lohman, 1837. It is not generally 
known that the "Public Life of Mr. Tulrumble" 
was reprinted in separate form in New York 
shortly after its appearance in "Bentley's Miscel- 
lany," the pamphlet containing also the first two 
chapters of "Oliver Twist," as they appeared in 
the February number of the "Miscellany." Both 
"Mr. Tulrumble" and the two chapters of "Oliver 
Twist" appeared later as the initial articles of a 
two volume "Collection of Tales and Sketches 
from Bentley's Miscellany and The Library of 
Fiction," published by Carey, Lea, and Blanchard 
in Philadelphia. This is one of the earliest of 
Dickens's publications in America. The publisher 
introduces his author to the American public with 
the following interesting comment on the back 
wrapper: "There is much genuine humor and much 
real fun in the productions of Boz. If they keep 
up to their present level they will, in conclusion, 
assume, a high place in the ranks of comic litera- 
ture." The item was knocked down to George 
D. Smith for $160. 

At the same sale Gabriel Weis paid $346 for 
"The Annals of Sporting and Fancy Gazette," Lon- 
don, 1822-28, illustrated with a large number of 
finely colored and plain plates by Alken, Cruik- 
shank, Landseer, Herring, Egerton, and other 
artists, including Cruikshank's colored engraving 
of "The Prize Fight at Five Courts." "Notions," 
with thirty-six full-page colored plates by Alken, 
oblong folio, London, 1831-33, was bought on 
order for $145. "Memoirs of the Life of the late 
John Mytton," by C. J. Apperley, with eighteen 
colored plates by Alken and Rawlins, London, 
1835, went to E. P. Button & Co., for $100. It 
is the second edition containing six more plates 
than the first edition. "The Life of a Sportsman," 
by Apperley, London, 1842, first edition, with thirty- 
six colored plates by Alken, was knocked down to

THE DIAL 



[June 28 



No excuse of any kind or tort or in any form or 
shape will be taken. You must be here on Mon- 
day evening at seven. I am in a very peremptory 
moment and you will disobey at your peril. The 
Marquis de Negro will be with us, and exclusive of 
the pleasure, which his almost miraculous exhibition 
will give you, I am very anxious that some English 
gentleman of classical authority like yourself, and 
with your perfect knowledge of the Italian language, 
should hear, judge and report of him. 

The rare original edition of William Mudford's 
"Historical Account of the Campaign in the Neth- 
erlands in 1815," printed in London in 1817 and 
in binding by Sangorski and Sutcliffe, was obtained 
by Gabriel Weis for $133. It is embellished with 
twenty-seven colored plates descriptive of the coun- 
try between Brussels and Charleroi from drawings 
made on the spot by James Rouse. It includes 
three plates, one of the Battle of Waterloo by 
George Cruikshank, plans of the battle, and a map 
showing the march of the allied armies to Paris, 
with a colored emblematic title-page by Cruik- 
shank. Mr. Garth paid $200 for "Somebody's 
Luggage," fifty-four leaves, extracted from "House- 
hold Words" and "All the Year Round," with 
manuscript corrections, deletions, and additions in 
Charles Dickens's handwriting. This was the copy 
which was sent to the United States and from 
which the American edition of "Somebody's Lug- 
gage" was printed. 

The first issue of the first edition of Pierce 
Egan's "Life in London," 1821, in binding by Bed- 
ford, was knocked down to Gabriel Weis for $190. 
It has thirty-six colored plates designed and etched 
by Isaac R. and George Cruikshank, numerous 
woodcuts by the same artists, and pages of en- 
graved music. A special feature of the volume is 
the inclusion of all the original wrappers and ad- 
vertisements, this copy being bound from the or- 
iginal parts. A first edition of the same author's 
"Real Life in London," two volumes, entirely un- 
cut, 1821-22, went to T. J. Gannon for $155. It 
has thirty-three colored plates by Alkcn, Rowland- 
son, Dighton, Brooke, and others. It contains the 
two extra plates, "Catching a Charley Napping" 
and "St. George's Day," which are generally want- 
ing, also the leaf, "A Word to the Wise," adver- 
tising the forthcoming "Real Life in Ireland." Mr. 
Weis paid $380 for Egan's "Finish to the Ad- 
ventures of Tom, Jerry and Logic," first edition, 
London, 1830, in binding by Bedford. It has 
thirty-six colored plates by Robert Cruikshank and 
numerous designs on wood by him. 

The original manuscript in French of a portion 
of Napoleon Bonaparte's own memoirs, dictated to 
General Gaspard Gourgaud at St. Helena, eleven 
pages folio, was bought by Mr. Weis for $160. It 
describes Napoleon's arrival in France from Egypt, 
and the inauguration of the "Consuls Provisoires," 
Napoleon's first move toward an absolute dictator- 
ship. This manuscript was presented by General 
Gourgaud to his friend, John Jackson, of Ham- 
burg, Germany, at whose death it passed to his 
brother James Jackson. Three topographical field 
maps, delineating in detail the northern part of 
France and a portion of Belgium, actually used by 
Napoleon on his last campaign and at the Battle 



of Waterloo, went to G. S. Hellman for $110. 
Mr. Weis gave $175 for "The Eventful Life of 
Napoleon Bonaparte, Late Emperor of the French." 
four volumes, London, 1828. This is a rare issue 
of W. H. Ireland's book, in which he disguises 
his identity under the pseudonym of "Baron Karlo 
Excellmanns." It varies widely from the issue 
usually met with, having an entirely different set 
of plates and changes in the text. Charles Scrib- 
ner's Sons paid $310 for Ireland's "Napoleon," with 
twenty-four colored plates by George Cruikshank, 
and the rare Cumberland vignetti- titles, four vol- 
umes, London, 1823-28, in binding by Walters. 

First editions of William Combe's "English 
Dance of Death" and "Dance of Life," with colored 
plates by Thomas Rowlandson, were bought by 
Mr. Weis for $140. James F. Drake paid $116 
for "Cicero's Cato Major, or his Discourse of Old 
Age," Philadelphia, printed and sold by Benjamin 
Franklin, 1744, in binding by Stikeman. It is the 
earliest issue. The translation was made by Judge 
James Logan of Philadelphia, though the introduc- 
tory note is by Franklin himself. Typographically 
this work is generally considered Franklin's master- 
piece. 

Henry E. Huntington, George D. Smith, James 
F. Drake, Lathrop C. Harper, and other rare-book 
collectors are interested in the sale at Sotheln s 
beginning July 11, of the sixth portion of the fa- 
mous library of the late Henry Huth. It takes in 
items under the letters N to P and will be the 
thirty-fourth to thirty-ninth day's sale of this val- 
uable collection. Among the items is "Nychodemus 
Gospell," printed by Wynkyn de Worde in London 
in 1511, the second known edition. No other copy 
appears in auction records. The "Office of the 
Virgin Mary," printed on vellum, Lugdunum, 
1499, is rare, only three copies being known. 
"Opera Nova," printed at Venice about 1520, is a 
veritable block book, the whole of the text being 
engraved on wood. It is the only known work of 
the kind printed in Italy, and it is remarkable that 
it should have appeared at so late a date. It is an 
imitation of the "Biblia Panperum." "The hon- 
orable, pleasant and rare conceited Historic of 
Palmendos," translated from the French by An- 
thony Munday, London, 1589, is the first edition. 
It is dedicated to Sir Francis Drake in twelve Latin 
verses. The only other known copy was that in 
Heber's catalogue and it was damaged. The pres- 
ent is a fine copy in binding by Bedford. 

J. Partridge's "Opus Reformatum, or a Treatise 
of Astrology," 1693, is the copy mentioned by 
Lowndes as bound by Roger Payne. Inside the 
cover is his curious bill for the work, amounting 
to sixteen shillings, for washing, sizing, mending. 
and binding. Extremely rare is "A Treatyse called 
Pcrvula" printed in black letter by Wynkyn de 
Worde about 1509. The woodcut of a master and 
scholars is on the title. "Peniteas Cito," printed In 
Wynkyn de Worde about 1510, appears to be quite 
undescribed by bibliographers. "De Opcrc Varie." 
of Francesco de Petrarca, is a manuscript of the 
fifteenth century of Italian execution, written on 
190 leaves of vellum with numerous painted and 
illuminated initials. "I Trionfi," by Petrarch, is

a manuscript on vellum of the end of the fifteenth 
century, with six miniatures by an artist of the 
Florentine school. "A Petite Pallace of Pettie his 
pleasure," London, about 1576, is very rare. It is 
a collection of twelve novels by George Pettie. 
The only other copies of this impression known are 
in the British Museum, formerly Jolley's, and in 
the Bodleian among Malone's books. William 
Petty's "Hiberniae Delineatio," 1685, is a fine 
specimen of English binding of the seventeenth 
century, probably by S. Mearne. 

"Lo innamoramento et la morte di Piramo et 
Tisbe," printed in Florence in the fifteenth century, 
is in binding by Bauzonnet-Trautz and comes from 
the Yemeniz collection. "Pontificale" (missal) is a 
richly illuminated manuscript on vellum of Franco- 
Flemish execution in the fifteenth century. It is 
written in large Gothic letters on 156 leaves. 
"Portalano" is a manuscript on vellum of the six- 
teenth century, consisting of ten beautifully exe- 
cuted illuminated maps, comprising the world as 
then known. Another "Portalano" is an illum- 
inated manuscript on twenty double sheets of vel- 
lum, forming an atlas of the whole world as known 
at the end of the sixteenth century or beginning of 
the seventeenth. It includes the discoveries in 
America. It came from the library of the arch- 
bishop of Toledo. The arms of Portugal and 
Spain are emblazoned on each map. "Preces Piae" 
is a manuscript on vellum of the early sixteenth 
century of French or Flemish execution. "Psalter- 
ium Davidis" is a manuscript on vellum of Ger- 
man execution of the fourteenth century.

ica and subsequently in London.

These include the families of the men 
of arts and letters. Usually well-born, 
accustomed to advantages of human 
civilization, they frequently find them- 
selves in want, when the head of the 
house is summoned to the colors or 
killed in action. 

The Authors' League Fund cares

Hello Buck!" 










RECALL that golden day when you first read "Huck Finn"? How your mother 
said, "For goodness' sake, stop laughing aloud over that book. You sound so 
silly." But you couldn't stop laughing. 

Today when you read "Huckleberry Finn" you will not laugh so much. You will 
chuckle often, but you will also want to weep. The deep humanity of it the pathos, 
that you never saw, as a boy, will appeal to you now. You were too busy laughing to 
notice the limpid purity of the master's style. 

MARK TWAIN 



When Mark Twain first wrote "Huckleberry 
Finn" this land was swept with a gale of laughter. 
When he wrote "The Innocents Abroad" even 
Europe laughed at it itself. 

But one day there appeared a new book from 
his pen, so spiritual, so true, so lofty, that those 



who did not know him well were amazed. "Joan 
of Arc" was the work of a poet a historian a 
seer. Mark Twain was all of these. His was not 
the light laughter of a moment's fun, but the 
whimsical humor that made the tragedy of life 
more bearable. 



The Price Goes Up 

This is Mark Twain's own set. This is the set he wanted in the home of each of those who love him. 
Because he asked it, Harpers have worked to make a perfect set at half price. 

Before the war we had a contract price for paper so we could sell this set of Mark Twain at half price.

A Real American 

Mark Twain was a steamboat pilot. He was 
a searcher for gold in the far west. He was a 
printer. He worked bitterly hard. All this 
without a glimmer of the great destiny that lay 
before him. 

Then, with the opening of the great wide 
West, his genius bloomed. 

His fame spread through the nation. It 
flew to the ends of the earth, until his work 
was translated into strange tongues. From 
then on, the path of fame lay straight to the 
high places. At the height of his fame he lost 
all his money. He was heavily in debt, but 
though 60 years old, he started afresh and paid 
every cent. It was the last heroic touch that 
drew him close to the hearts of his countrymen. 

The world has asked is there an American 
literature? Mark Twain is the answer. He 
is the heart, the spirit of America. From his 
poor and struggling boyhood to his glorious, 
splendid old age, he remained as simple, as 
democratic as the plainest of our forefathers. 

He was, of all Americans, the most Ameri- 
can. Free in soul, and dreaming of high 
things brave in the face of trouble and al- 
ways ready to laugh. That was Mark Twain.

The prevailing: note of the hook is genuine 
and tender sympathy with tin- victims of 
(rerman barbarity. He describes, in simple 
but touching words, his encounters with 
wounded soldiers, Sisters of Mercy, and 
homeless Belgian orphans. But even under 
Pierre Loti's mask of artistic restraint one 
can recognise the wrathful and contemptu- 
ous bitterness that fills tin- soul of every 
Frenchman when he thinks of the things 
that have been done in the name of war.

Lend Me your Name! 

A summer idyll with a decidely humorous turn, based 
upon the adventures of an earl and a burglar who change 
places. The story begins and ends on Fifth Avenue, but 
most of it is laid in a cool green spot appropriately called 
the "Forest of Arden." There are girls in the story, of 
course, one girl in particular 

The author is Francis Perry Elliott, who has become 
rather well known because of his "Pals First" and 
"Haunted Pajamas." His talent for the farcical is among 
the finest in this country. 

In Lend Me Your Name! Mr. Elliott has frankly adorned 
a tale rather than pointed a moral. It is not as deep as 
some literary wells, but it is refreshing. And it is distinctly

THE JOYFUL YEARS 



By F. T. WAWN 



Net $1.50 



A romance of real human life. Just a love story, in fact, but one done by a master hand. Humor, 
beauty, and gladness, these are the keynotes of this simple and exquisite story of the making of a 
boy and girl into a man and woman presented with such subtle art that it appears artless. The 
background is principally laid in the wild and legend-haunted scenery of Northern Cornwall, the 
country of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. 



HELEN OF FOUR GATES

The author of this extraordinary "first 
book" is referred to in England as one of 
the most remarkable writers of recent

beauty, real poetry. Helen is a creation." 

BEHIND THE THICKET 

By W. E. B. HENDERSON. Net $1.50 

A book of vivid imagination, power, and extraor- 
dinary originality. 

New York Herald: "The reading public has gained 
a new novelist of no small ability and one who is 
destined to go far in the field of fiction." 

EL SUPREMO 

By EDWARD LUCAS WHITE. Net $1.90 

The most highly-praised novel published in 
years. 

The Philadelphia Press : "Found that to open this 
book is to walk into a picturesque civilization which 
to all but a few scholars is practically unknown," 
and that "to read it to the end is to enjoy a 
historical romance of striking merit."

SEEN AND HEARD 

By MARY and JANE FINDLATER. Net $1.50 

New York Herald: "The book is a 'war book,' but 
the crash of cannon and the cry of the wounded 
are in the far background. Few volumes that are 
so good have come out of Scotland in a generation ; 
none that is better."

By SAMUEL BUTLER. Author of "The Way of 
All Flesh." Introduction by FRANCIS HACKETT. 
The finest satire since Swift's "Gulliver's Travels."

Under the guise of describing the habits and cus- 
toms of a strange race found in the mountains of 
New Zealand the author flays the shams and in- 
consistencies of our latter-day civilization. 

THE GOLDEN ARROW 

By MARY WEBB. Net $1.50 

Boston Advertiser: "A story of a lovely mountain 
glen on the border of Wales. The author has

of this far-away country and given it to us in a 
way we shall not forget." 

GONE TO EARTH 

By MARY WEBB. Net $1.50 

The author of "The Golden Arrow" showed in her 
first book a most unusual understanding and sym- 
pathy with the folk of the remote countryside 
whose lives are lived close to the soil and bounded 
by the crops, the weather, and the herds. 
In "Gone to Earth," her new story, the same stage 
is set, but the author shows a growing power 
her characters are more concentrated, the fierce 
love and elemental jealousy that glow somberly and 
finally break into flame, are drawn with poignant 
intensity, while the sudden touches of humor are 
as quaint and incalculable as human nature itself.

Russian Literature: The Quest for Life's Meaning 



From the early years of the nineteenth 
century, Russian literature has been an in- 
strument barometric in its responsiveness 
to the political and social conditions of the 
country. It came to close grips with the 
facts of life. The writers of Russia's 
"golden age": Turgenev, Dostoevsky, 
Tolstoy, and the lesser men who wrote 
before the eighties of the last century, 
were not idle singers in a dreamy Nirvana. 
Theirs was a robust consciousness, an 
awakened social conscience that laid heavy 
responsibilities and exacting duties upon 
them. They had to advance the frontiers 
of civilization, to deal telling blows for 
the freedom of man, to arouse and 
strengthen the powers of the spirit for the 
stern battle against the hordes of dark- 
ness. Truth, Freedom, Humanity, Beauty 
were the altars they erected for the wor- 
ship of men. They had not sallied forth 
on a light and joyous adventure. Clear- 
eyed, sober, in a mood of tremendous 
earnestness, they set out on their great 
voyage of discovery. The adventure took 
them to the farthest reaches of the illimit- 
able plain of life, and they wandered on, 
impelled by a great spiritual yearning and 
unrest. There could be no boundaries, for 
an ever-elusive ideal broke the spell of 
momentary revelations of reality, and 
beckoned them on to far horizons and dis- 
tant goals, forever unattainable. Vica- 
rious salvations, provisional salving of the 
conscience could not content these uncom- 
promising spirits who, with hands out- 
stretched for a great faith and with hearts 
eager for the purgation of the salient 
truths of life, were embarked on the search 
for final meanings. With rare intuition 
they knew that the light to illuminate the 
way could come only from the comprehen- 
sion of the nature of man, not man dis- 
guised by romantic pretension or ascetic 
renunciation, but man as he really is, in 
his true self and his naked essence. They 
revolted against accidentals and limita- 



tions, under the inspiration of a passion 
for the ideal for moral perfection, intel- 
lectual clarity, spiritual freedom. But they 
never sought to codify life, to reduce it to 
dialectical schemes. The feeling of won- 
der and reverence for reality was too deep 
to make them merely thinkers ; they were, 
first of all, artists bent upon the recreation 
of life. 

With the death of Dostoevsky and Tur- 
genev, and with Tolstoy's tragic renuncia- 
tion of art, the period of intense literary 
effort came to an end. Almost synchro- 
nously, an event occurred in the political 
life of the nation which exercised a pro- 
found influence upon literature : Alexander 
II was assassinated. "Gentlemen, rise, the 
Government is coming back," said a noted 
publicist, Katkov, and the prophecy ush- 
ered in a time of dark reaction when the 
intellectual energies of the nation were in- 
creasingly absorbed in the bitter struggle 
for political freedom. The outlook for 
literature was as bleak as a sudden autumn 
day near the end of an exuberant summer. 
In Russian literature the period of the 
eighties is one of grey, unrelieved hope- 
lessness. The time seemed like a great, 
fallow field strewn with dead hopes. The 
trust in the people, the ardent wish to 
awaken them from stagnation had proved 
a dream and a failure. It is Chekhov who 
best reflects the sombre mood of the time. 
All its grey monotony is in his stories, 
the wistful longings and the nervelessness 
of the intelligentsia, and their depressing 
sense of the emptiness and the insipidity of 
things; the stale, tinsel culture of the 
towns, and the hushed, dreary vacuity of 
provincial life. It is under the spell of this 
spirit in Chekhov that Leon Shestov, the 
well-known critic, calls him "the creator 
from the void." Chekhov's works form 
one long poem the poem of rainy 
weather. And yet, though Chekhov never 
attempts to solve life's riddles, with what 
wondrous reverence and finesse does he

THE DIAL 



[July 19 



present the bare facts of life! With a 
rare power of lifting the threadbare and 
the commonplace to the high plane of art, 
Chekhov pays homage to life in the very 
deference of his artistic reticence. 

For a time the relentless quest for the 
meaning of life halted, while art under- 
went a chilling bath in anti-aesthetic the- 
ories. New tendencies were abroad. An 
alien ideology was being assimilated by the 
eager intellectuals of Russia Western 
ideas and theorizings: positivist, socialis- 
tic, communistic. The intelligentsia swore 
allegiance to the doctrines of Marxian so- 
cialism and economic determinism, and 
fervently discussed hectic problems of 
Freedom and Necessity. Art was held in 
the leash of social values. It was not set 
free until man felt the impulse to a new 
liberty, the striving upward toward the 
ultimate perfection of the individual, 
toward the release of instincts and the 
liberation of self. Dostoevsky had lis- 
tened, terrified, to the first rumblings of 
the great revolt against all that he held 
sacred. To him the revolutionary move- 
ment in Russia appeared to be inspired by 
men who, in seeking God, were denying 
Christ. But the first assertion of the rights 
of the individual filled him with a great 
dread. He feared that the new force, ris- 
ing in Diabolonian protest from an abyss 
of accumulated wrath and vengeance, 
would hurl down everything traditional, 
and, like Savva in Andreyev's play, would 
wish to wreck the solid structure of the 
Past. His mind pictured to itself the tre- 
mendous menace of individuality: all 
bonds rent asunder, all things holy cut 
down, a thirst for blood and destruction, 
deep cynicism and boundless disbelief. 
And in the terrified imagining of all this 
evil, he sought to stem the tide by throwing 
broadcast into life texts from the Scrip- 
tures and bits of Slavophile formulas, like 
a priest sprinkling holy water over a sin- 
ning multitude. He called upon man to 
draw within himself, to develop spiritual 
power and attain inner mastery. 

But the new yearning for the power and 
the glory of the liberated individual was 
not to be denied. Too long had the intel- 
lectuals of Russia been like "living 
corpses," will-less, rudderless men, "sick- 



lied o'er with the pale cast of thought." 
1 hey now began to worship action, force, 
personality, that compelling strength of 
character which projects ideas and 
thoughts into the outer reality of deeds. 
Gorky uttered the hope of an awakened 
age when he said, "All of a man's life may 
be consumed in the doing of one deed, but 
that deed must be beautiful, splendid, 
free !' Here is a stern summoning to bat- 
tle, a buoyant, robust challenge to life in 
the very call to spend life's gathered forces 
in heroic service. For a brief space the 
morbid spirit of self-flagellation vanished, 
and the world was conceived as a vast 
battlefield, sometimes as a clash between 
the fit and the unfit, between the classes of 
society, sometimes as a tragic encounter of 
the individual with the elemental forces of 
nature, and again as a conflict between the 
powers of good and evil in man and in the 
outer universe. And what of the new sup- 
erman who, in the first ecstasy of his in- 
carnation, had appeared so invincible? 
Gorky, reawakened to a social conscious- 
ness, soon tempers the first proud assertion 
of individuality, and wishes to bind the 
new-born superman in the firm rivets of 
human duties. And the strong men of 
Andreyev, at the very moment of their 
sternest defiance of the unknown, are 
overcome by the feeling of their real weak- 
ness; they become solitary, terrified crea- 
tures whirled about in a maelstrom of 
grim and mysterious forces. 

The new ideas served but to bring 
back the thirst for the quest of life's mean- 
ing. In a great creation called "The 
Book of Life," the Russian sculptor 
Biegass represents a huge, passionless fig- 
ure with its enormous fists pressed against 
the Book of Life, wherein is inscribed all 
that man wishes to know. The knowledge 
would make man great and happy, but the 
expressionless face of the monster shows 
that the hands will never be lifted and 
that man will forever remain ignorant of 
what the book contains. One thinks of 
the modern writers of Russia as men strug- 
gling to wrest the monster's hands from 
the Book of Life, now in a passion of 
high resolve, now in the dread intensity 
of terror before death. Always the agon- 
izing weight of the perplexity of life's 



1917]

problems. Some seek release in thoughts 
of an eternal death that blots out every- 
thing; a few put their faith in an eternal 
life beyond death. But for the most part, 
these restless spirits have a deep-rooted 
instinct for life and a keen zest in the per- 
ception of reality. Together with a rap- 
turous, lyrical impulse to organize the 
outer world after the ideal pattern of 
Beauty, they have the stern obligation to 
scan crude reality, bitter, misshapen, de- 
formed. The outcome is a tragic clash 
between emotions of joy and horror in 
the presence of the actual a clash that 
finds its catharsis in irony, now mordant, 
now tender and mellow. 

Before the outbreak of the present war, 
the Russian writers, conventionally called 
the "modernists," had no fixed body of 
critical doctrine. Their ideas were in a 
state of suspension, still uncrystallized. 
Strongly opposed to critical dogmas, their 
only artistic tenet was that art is concerned, 
not with morality, but with beauty; its ap- 
peal is to the imagination. They asserted 
the intrinsic value of literature, and ac- 
claimed its liberation from ethical and 
moral chains. Having thrown open the 
windows of Russia to all the intellectual 
currents of Europe, they eagerly re- 
sponded to the new art movements of the 
West. They set out to explore the possi- 
bilities of their language and ushered in a 
poetic revival. The new poems are rich, 
tense, and adventurous in spirit and form. 
The poets revelled in sounds and verbal 
conjurings, and created hitherto unsus- 
pected harmonies and combinations. The 
abstract became alive with a strange 
beauty, and in the dim hinterlands of in- 
stinct, in the borderlands of the emotions, 
the explorers came upon fresh beauties, 
fleeting, mystic, ethereal. Reality acquired 
a new elusiveness that could be expressed 
only in hints, subtle half-tones, and shad- 
owy evocations. The enthusiastic sing- 
ers formed groups for the discussion of 
questions of style, metre, rhythm; mani- 
festoes and magazines were issued em- 
bodying the new principles and practice; 
and in the artistic unrest, literary schools 
were generated symbolists, vorticists, ac- 
meists, futurists. 

It was all a fiery revolt in the name of 



art. For a brief time, in the months pre- 
ceding the Revolution of 1905, the new 
writers were plunged again into the 
troubled stream of political and social con- 
flicts. The gospel of the folk returned 
and the social conscience was stirred to re- 
newed activity. It was in response to the 
spirit of the revolutionary turmoil that a 
literary magazine, "Novy Put" (The New 
Way), founded in 1903 by Madame 
Merezhovsky, was rechristened, toward 
the close of 1904, "Voprosy Zhizni" 
(Questions of Life). The "accursed 
problems" came to the forefront once 
more, and the modernists, in a mood of 
heroic renunciation, welcomed the onrush 
of social forces that bade fair to destroy 
the altars of art they had so recently 
erected. Drunk with the new wine of ap- 
proaching fulfilment, men like Artsybashev 
acclaimed once more the divine rights of 
human personality. 'And the sanctities of 
convention became stale and paltry at the 
moment of the ruthless assertion of indi- 
vidual freedom. But the high hopes 
aroused by the revolutionary ferment were 
soon blighted by the return of bureau- 
cratic tyranny, and men were again thrown 
back upon themselves, to seek liberty in 
the unreal realm of hidden thoughts and 
dreams and aspirations. 

This repeated baffling of man's desires 
for himself and for others heightened the 
tragic note in the new literature. In spite 
of the quest for novel forms, the frequent 
overemphasis and exaggerations, the cru- 
dities of style, and the large admixture 
of the baser metal of naturalism, the mod- 
ern literature of Russia is not a mere pur- 
suit of the novel and the exotic in theme 
and manner. It is a literature born of 
heavy hearts, of a consciousness of sin 
and bitterness, and a dread obsession of 
evil. But with all the prevailing gloom 
and depression, it does not fail to give an 
affirmation of life. The modern writers, 
Andreyev, Kuprin, Sologub, Remizov, 
Bunin, and the rest, are still embarked 
on the quest for truth; theirs is still the 
undying resolve to know life's meaning. 
They are the spiritual heirs of Dostoevsky 
and Tolstoy. Like the former, they ex- 
plore the dark corners of the human soul 
and trespass in forbidden realms of the

subjective and the psychologic. And they 
have Tolstoy's keen perception of reality, 
and something of his dauntless spirit in the 
pursuit of the ultimate. 

In what manner will the annealing 
forces of war shape the literature of Rus- 
sia? Unfortunately, not enough of the 
work written under the stress of moving 
events has reached this country to form 
the bases of sure judgments. But the war 
stories in the Russian magazines, Artsy- 
bashev's play, "War," the sketches and 
tales of Alexis N. Tolstoy, Veressayev, 
and Chirikov, and especially Andreyev's 
"The Burden of War," give promise of a 
great sobering and spiritual regeneration. 
Perhaps the severe discipline of war will 
bring to an end the excesses of pre-bellum 
"decadence" : facile pessimism, unre- 
strained symbolism, shoddy individualism, 
and erotic and neurotic extravagance. The 
war has brought new revelations, trans- 
formed reality, and made possible the 
realization of the dream of a century. 
Russia's mighty autocracy has fallen. How 
the sudden exhilaration of this event will 
be reflected in literature we can only sur- 
mise. Perhaps the best energies of Russia 
will be increasingly absorbed in guiding 
the tremendous social readjustments of the 
future. But already it is possible to dis- 
cern, in their transitional stages, the forces 
that will bring to Russian literature a 
saner, richer realism and a surer faith in 
the spiritual and moral instincts of man. 
The effort to solve the great problems that 
face the country will help to determine the 
course of the new literature. But it is the 
release of colossal industrial forces the 
economic awakening that will lift the 
dark cloud from the spirit of Russian lit- 
erature. Russia is now passing through 
the first stages of this awakening. Towns 
have sprung up, especially in Siberia, 
around the yawning mouths of mine-pits. 
More and more the new writers of Rus- 
sia describe, in the manner of our own 
Bret Harte, the stir of life amid fresh 
and epic beginnings. A Russian poet, 
Alexander Blok, has sung of the rise from 
"the dim underground" of his country's 
"new Messiah, the black coal, bride- 
groom and king" : 



'Tis the groan of the coal and the marshes, 
And the groan of the oar, near and far; 

For I see o'er the boundless steppe rising 
Lo! Another America's star. 

The imagination of true artists will ever 
be aroused by the contemplation of new 
realities, the release of fresh energies. 
With the cheerful sense of fulfilment, there 
is for Russian literature the promise of a 
healthier, saner perception, and a more 
restrained and balanced expression, of 
reality. The writers of Russia do not 
have to go afar for teaching or disci- 
pline. Their own literary traditions are by 
no means sterile or exhausted. Faithful 
to the great masters, the moderns will 
scan eagerly all phases of human activity 
and all manifestations of human emotion, 
dedicated to the high task by their soul's 
need for truth. They have known a tragic 
insufficiency, the savor of sin, and the taste 
of death, and it will not be easy for them 
to forget. LOUJS s> FRIEDLAND. 



The Poetry of Ralph Hodgson 

Readers of THE DIAL are familiar with 
the view, put forward by Mr. Conrad 
Aiken, that the present-day generation of 
English poets is superior, at least as re- 
gards distinction of workmanship, to the 
foremost of the Americans. With this 
view most careful readers of poetry will 
probably find themselves in agreement. 
The faults of American poetry at the pres- 
ent day are the obvious faults of a nation 
which has not yet hammered out for itself 
a literary tradition, which indeed has not 
yet created out of its stuff and substance 
documents numerous enough to give 
weight and direction to any tradition. If 
we should set ourselves the task of trying 
to read the most important works of the 
poets whose names appear in any fairly 
exhaustive survey of English poetry (such 
as, for example, Professor Saintsburv's 
"History of English Prosody"), we should 
soon find a single lifetime insufficient. But 
it is comparatively easy to read through 
the work of all the American poets who 
have in any way distinguished themscKrs. 

The question that requires to be askul 
and it is a question that affects Fnglarul

as well as America is, what relation does 
the present-day poetry of England bear to 
the stream of English tradition and cul- 
ture? Are the English poets of the pres- 
ent day producing anything worthy to be 
mentioned in the same breath with the 
achievements of Blake, Byron, Words- 
worth, Coleridge, Keats, Shelley, Tenny- 
son, Browning, and Swinburne, to go no 
further than the nineteenth century? Can 
these poets in any sense be said to measure 
up to the past, or to carry English poetry 
one step further? This question is vitally 
important to the future of our poetry, 
which requires a strong English tradition 
to guide and balance it. And it is equally 
important to England, in view of the great 
regeneration of the English race which 
this war is bringing about. 

Among the younger English poets, one 
of the most recently discussed is Mr. 
Ralph Hodgson. Since he has just brought 
out in a small volume the fruits of his 
Muse fruits somewhat difficult to obtain 
hitherto, since they appeared under the 
irritating guise of half a dozen or so 
pamphlets called "chap-books" or "broad- 
sides" and since Mr. Hodgson is a typi- 
cal example of one tendency in present-day 
English poetry, we may take him as a con- 
venient starting-point. We do so without 
disrespect to his elders. Youth must be 
served, and Mr. Hodgson is yet young. 

Of the poems contained in this volume, 
the ones which have hitherto found most 
favor are "Time, You Old Gipsy Man," 
"Eve," "The Song of Honour," and "The 
Bull." Of these the first two may be 
bracketed together because of their close 
similarity in metre and technique. "Eve" 
is the better. Here are its opening stanzas: 

Eve, with her basket, was 

Deep in the bells and grass, 

Wading in bells and grass 

Up to her knees, 

Picking a dish of sweet 

Berries and plums to eat, 

Down in the bells and grass 

Under the trees. 

Mute as a mouse in a 
Corner the cobra lay, 
Curled round a bough of the 
Cinnamon tall. . . 
Now to get even and 
Humble proud heaven and 
Now was the moment or 
Never at all. 



This is a very pretty picture a minia- 
ture, doubtless, but still a pretty picture. 
It is when we come to compare it with 
certain works of the past that its deriva- 
tive nature becomes manifest. The tone 
is of the artificial pastoral with which 
Herrick has made us familiar. But Her- 
rick is, after all, a minor poet; and there 
is nothing here to match "Bid me to live 
and I will live thy Protestant to be," or 
"Her eyes the glow-worm lend thee." The 
metre and rhyme scheme recall Milliken's 
"Groves of Blarney" 

There's statues gracing 
This noble place in, 
All heathen gods and 
Nymphs so fair, 
Bold Neptune, Plutarch, 
And Nicodemus, 
All standing naked 
In the open air! 

In short, there is nothing of Mr. Hodg- 
son himself in these two stanzas but the 
"cinnamon tall" and that, too, is purely 
literary. Later on, Mr. Hodgson speaks 
of a "cinnamon bee." Apparently, he likes 
the sound of this word. 

"The Song of Honour" is a direct 
transcription of Christopher Smart's 
"Song to David." A single stanza of this 
poem set beside the work of the older 
poet, will bring this out, and also perhaps 
show why the latter is preferable. 

I heard the universal choir, 

The Sons of Light exalt their Sire 

With universal song, 

Earth's lowliest and loudest notes, 

Her million times ten million throats 

Exalt Him loud and long, 

And lips and lungs and tongues of Grace 

From every part and every place 

Within the shining of His face, 

The universal throng. 

That is Hodgson. 

He sang of God the mighty source 

Of all things the stupendous force 

On which all strength depends; 

From whose right arm, beneath whose eyes, 

All period, power, and enterprise 

Commences, reigns, and ends. 

Tell them, I am, Jehovah said 

To Moses; while earth heard in dread, 

And, smitten to the heart, 

At once above, beneath, around, 

All Nature, without voice or sound, 

Replied, o LORD, THOU ART. 

This is Smart, writing in 1757!

THE DIAL 



[July 19 



With "The Bull" we come upon the in- 
fluence that pervades so much of Mr. 
Hodgson's work, as well as the work of 
so many of the poets of the present day 
in England. Need it be said that I am re- 
ferring to William Blake? Here is a 
stanza of "The Bull" : 

When the lion left his lair 

And roared his beauty through the hills, 

And the vultures picked their quills 

And flew into the middle air, 

Then this prince no more to reign 

Came to life and lived again. 

This comes direct from Blake's "Tiger" 
with its lines, 

When the stars threw down their spears 
And watered heaven with their tears; 

and in the coloring of the poem there 
is more than a hint of Thomas Gordon 
Hake, that remarkable symbolist whose 
three fine poems, "The Birth of Venus," 
"The Snake-Charmer," and "Old Souls," 
should be, and are not, in every anthology 
of English poetry. 

In the shorter lyrics, the ghost of Blake 
stalks rampant. "Stupidity Street," "The 
Bells of Heaven," and "The Birdcatcher" 
all come from "a robin redbreast in a cage 
puts heaven in a rage." And it may be 
said of all the others that they either de- 
rive from Blake direct, or from Blake di- 
luted with Herrick. Poetry, like poverty, 
makes strange bedfellows; and it would be 
amusing to show how Mr. Hodgson has 
grafted upon the sturdy oak of the man 
who wrote that "improvement makes 
straight roads, but crooked roads without 
improvement are the roads of genius," 
the graceful, trailing vine of "get up sweet 
slug-a-bed and see the dew bespangling 
herb and tree." But I will spare the 
reader. 

One more piece deserves to be noted. 
"The Royal Mails" is simply a poem of 
Wordsworth born out of time. Every- 
body knows that letters are no longer car- 
ried by courier in England, and that the 
highways are no longer infested with 
thieves. But here we have the tale of a 
courier robbed by highwaymen, told in the 
same ballad metre as "The Complaint of 



the Forsaken Indian Woman," or "The 
Thorn." Let anyone who wishes compare 
these poems with Mr. Hodgson's. 

If the reader has followed me this far, 
he may now ask what I am seeking to 
prove by these parallels. Am I seeking 
to impugn Mr. Hodgson's honesty, or am 
I merely displaying the extent of my own 
reading? I can only answer that I believe 
Mr. Hodgson to be a conscientious, pains- 
taking writer who believes he is following 
the true path; and that I am not a scholar 
by profession. My aim lies elsewhere. 

In every art, as in every nation that is 
healthy, the principle of life and growth 
must manifest itself. Thus in Greek liter- 
ature we get, first of all, the development 
of the epic; then follows the development 
of the lyric; and finally, the combination 
of the two in a new art-form, the drama. 
And it is equally possible to take up Eng- 
lish literature and to show how it has 
grown and altered. Thus in the case of 
the drama, we get first disconnected scenes 
from the Bible: the Mystery plays; then 
ethical sermons presented by typified ab- 
stractions: the Moralities; then, under the 
influence of the Renaissance, the drama 
becomes secular and passes through the 
phases of interlude and farce to chronicle 
plays, heroic tragedy, comedy, domestic 
tragedy, etc., to conclude in tragic-comed- 
ies of romantic adventure out of which 
again comes the art-form of the English 
novel. 

But on the other hand, we know that 
when a literature ceases to grow, and 
merely repeats itself, that literature is 
dead. It no longer draws its nourish- 
ment out of life, but only out of libraries. 
It may indeed for a time continue to dis- 
play a sophisticated and faded charm, but 
it is spiritually moribund and mentally in- 
capable of reacting to altering conditions. 
For such a literature, there is no hope, un- 
less the influence of some great crisis 
comes to brace and restore it. 

Perhaps the war is providing that in- 
fluence. In view of the flood of heroic 
energy let loose by the war, Mr. Hodg- 
son's poetry is merely a well-bred anach- 



ronism.

The Mind of England at War 

ENGLAND AND THE WAR. By Andre Chevrillon. 
(Doubleday, Page & Co.; $1.60.) 

M. Chevrillon has not entered upon the diffi- 
cult task he has undertaken in this volume with- 
out important qualifications. His studies of 
Sidney Smith and of Ruskin have shown him to 
be, for almost twenty years, an acute and sym- 
pathetic observer of English life. If he lacks 
the monumental knowledge and superb insight 
which makes of M. Halevy the greatest living 
student of modern England, his book yet reveals 
a mastery of his subject which is sufficiently rare 
to be stimulating and helpful. What he has at- 
tempted is a psychological study of the English 
mind in the first eighteen months of war. It is 
an impressionist picture he has striven to paint, 
which, ignoring detail and circumstance, shall yet 
concentrate attention upon the fundamental as- 
pects of his problem. The result is in many ways 
remarkably successful. I would hazard the guess 
that M. Chevrillon belongs far too closely by 
temperament and opinion to the Kipling-Lloyd 
George school of intense action-at-all-costs to 
appreciate the exact nuance of men like Sir John 
Simon and Mr. George Lansbury. His sym- 
pathy is too clearly with the present English 
government to make it possible for him to judge 
of dissent from its attitude with impartiality. 
But when allowance for the human fact of con- 
viction is made this is the best interim study of 
the English attitude the war has so far produced. 

When the history of the war can be written 
in something like an adequate perspective, there 
will be few more fascinating chapters than that 
which records the change in the attitude of Eng- 
land toward its character. It is impossible to 
doubt that in the first months of the war there 
were few, even among the experts, who at all 
appreciated its probable magnitude. The extent 
of German preparation was totally unexpected. 
The greatness of German ambition was barely 
realized. A dull sense, indeed, existed that Ger- 
many was not friendly; but on the whole, there 
were few who understood how profound was her 
enmity. England went to war because Belgium 
was invaded, and it is as certain as things can be 
certain in the tortuous labyrinth of diplomacy 
that had the neutrality of Belgium been re- 
spected, Sir Edward Grey would not have se- 
cured the willing adhesion of most Englishmen 
to the attitude of which he was protagonist. It 
was only fitfully that a deeper sense of perspec- 
tive became possible. England parts slowly with 



her traditional institutions ; and it took her states- 
men long to realize that much of the old machin- 
ery could not be adapted to such new and 
gigantic purposes. 

And when one realizes the magnitude of the 
change, it is impossible not to excuse the delay. 
The war has taken a ninth of the whole popula- 
tion of England into the fighting line; she had 
never before raised an army of more than a 
quarter of a million men. Her industrial system 
had been based on the theory that the interests 
of capital and labor are incompatible; what she 
was to learn was that somehow from a dual dis- 
harmony a synthesis of interests must be evolved. 
Her politics, as Mr. Balfour once said, rested 
on the assumption that life is an organized quar- 
rel; now she had to govern without the aid of 
parliamentary criticism. And she had no time 
for adjustment. She could only learn by actual 
experience that high explosives and not shrapnel 
were the right kind of ammunition. She could 
only learn by serious losses that the submarine 
was a far more potent weapon than any of her 
experts except Sir Percy Scott had been will- 
ing to admit. She had to control a vast mechan- 
ism of credit upon which her allies were in 
complete dependence. She had to maintain in as 
full degree as possible the ordinary operations of 
business enterprise. New problems arose at every 
moment the relations of skilled to unskilled 
workers, the position of women in industry, the 
rebellion in Ireland. Grave fissures were appar- 
ent in the political system. Administrators of 
every sort and kind had to be discovered and 
trained; an army had to be constructed from 
clerks and teachers, cricketers and engineers. If 
England reacted slowly to so novel a situation 
the fact is surely pardonable. She had not the 
experience of 1870 to look back upon as a vivid 
memory. She had no invader upon her own 
soil. As a nation, she had always been unin- 
terested in foreign politics, and the realignment of 
her ideas required an immense intellectual effort. 
She found it difficult to understand that she was 
combating a nation which had consciously willed 
the dominion of the world. She herself had 
strayed into empire; and it is a matter of record 
that only since the time of Froude and Mr. 
Chamberlain has she awakened to its immense 
and beneficent possibilities. It was little less 
than a revelation to most Englishmen that Ger- 
many should look upon them as lustful of power, 
as determined to prevent her attainment of a 
manifest destiny. What would have happened 
if Germany had acted with the honesty that 



54

[Juh 1" 



civilization demands, it is, of course, impossible 
to say. But the treatment of Belgium, the pride 
in cruelty, in injustice, in treachery by which 
every step in the German campaign was distin- 
guished, resulted in the stiffening of her pur- 
pose. Slowly and painfully, she came into line. 
She organized herself for the single purpose of 
defeating the German aims. She did it without 
hate, or pride, or ambition. It was the same 
call of duty to the ideal of freedom which in the 
sixteenth century had led her to smash the proud 
and insolent imperialism of Spain and in the nine- 
teenth the crude ambitions of Bonaparte. That 
service was her historic mission and she would 
not fail in her accomplishment. 

It is the analysis of this realization that M. 
Chevrillon has undertaken in his book. For him, 
the culminating point in the process he describes 
is the abandonment of the voluntary principle 
and its replacement by a conscript army. That 
step he regards as the pledge by Great Britain 
of all her resources to the struggle in hand. 
It is, for him, nothing so much as a national 
conversion. It is the completion of her full 
and intimate acquaintance with the extent and 
depth of the German menace. When England 
learned what was implied by the German phil- 
osophy of war, she was at first disinclined to 
admit that something tantamount to the abandon- 
ment of what civilization had with such diffi- 
culty achieved could be attempted by a whole 
nation; but the rape of Belgium and the sinking 
of the Lusitania drove her unwillingly to that 
conviction. On the whole I do not think M. 
Chevrillon's interpretation of the process is much 
out of perspective. Where he is less happy is 
in his treatment of the dissident strands of opin- 
ion, which are far more complex than he seems 
to imagine. Things, for example, like Mr. Lans- 
bury's urgent protest against the union of labor 
with the government are certainly not based on 
any disbelief in the rightness of the British cause, 
but on a doubt whether a capitalist state can in 
fact be the parent of that final democracy of 
which Mr. Lloyd George has constituted himself 
the apostle. He sees the industrial problems of 
the war less in terms of the achievement in muni- 
tions which M. Chevrillon so loudly applauds 
than in the immense profits in transportation and 
kindred industries, which even the excess-profits 
tax has failed really adequately to touch. He is 
distressed at the growing strength of bureaucracy, 
as evidenced in the too often thoughtless treat- 
ment of the dependents of soldiers and sailors. 
Now it is probable that Mr. Lansbury is a little 



prone to attribute to conscious ill-will, what 
a fact, no more than uncoiiM imi> stupidity. But 
it is important to realize that his general distrust 
of the state is the result of forty intimate and full 
years of political experience and not in the least 
related to the abstract principles of a jejune 
laissez-faire to which M. Chevrillon is anxious 
to ascribe it. The criticism of trade-unionism 
is, similarly, based on a complete misunderstand- 
ing of its nature. If he had been in England 
during the years between 1910 and the outbreak 
of war, his observation of the industrial position 
must have convinced him that its interpretation 
of the struggle in terms of class was by no means 
the intellectual chimera he imagines. He would 
have seen that what the war must industrially 
mean to many of the workers is the completion of 
an assault upon the very foundations of their 
strategic structure. Their suspicions, in that 
aspect, may not have been verified; but so cau- 
tious an observer as Mr. Sidney Webb has re- 
cently pointed out how impossible it is for the 
agreement between labor and the British govern- 
ment to be fulfilled. Mr. Lloyd George's prom- 
ise of a restoration of trade-union conditions h:is 
become simply impossible. It is obvious that 
this will lead to serious difficulty at the close of 
war, and that the state wjll be the main weapon 
in the hands of capitalists to prevent that diffi- 
culty from assuming a form popularly called 
threatening. It is in the light of problems such 
as these that M. Chevrillon should have analyzed 
the motives and fears of labor. 

What one cannot help hoping is that he will 
turn from this brilliant journalism to a more 
permanent and profound study. He will trust. 
then, not to the guidance and confidence of Mr. 
Kipling but to acquaintance with parts of Eng- 
land too rarely known to the external observer. 
In social experiment he will realize that the 
future of England lies far more probably with 
effort like that of Miss Sylvia Pankhurst and 
Mr. George Lansbury in the East End of Lon- 
don, than with that of the more blazoned circles 
of the West. He will come to understand that 
the political thought which is going to count in 
the years that lie ahead is that of Dr. Figgis 
and Mr. Delisle Burns, of Graham Wallas and 
Mr. Bertrand Russell. He will see that the 
things to examine are experiments like that of 
guild socialism, of the organization m such un- 
skilled workers as the dockers of London. It 
will be a new England that will meet his eyes; 
but upon the basis of a victory in this war, it will 
be the England that is going to count.

LIFE SINGS A SONG. By Samuel Hoffenstein. 

(Wilmarth Publishing Co.; $1.) 

The hasty critic who a year and a half ago, 
when "Good Friday" was published, lamented 
that book as final proof of the decline of Mr. 
Masefield, meets something of a poser in Mr. 
Masefield's newest volume, "Lollingdon Downs." 
Mr. Masefield is of that type of creative artist 
which is most distressing to the critic with a 
mania for classifying: he will not remain classi- 
fied ; he is forever in a process of evolution. This 
is indeed the highest compliment that could be 
paid him. It is not every poet who is capable 
of growth and change of a creative sort. With 
most poets the only marked modifications from 
book to book are technical. They adumbrate in 
one book what they achieve in the next. They 
mark out their province, they develop it, they 
exploit it, and at last they exhaust it. Con- 
sistency, emotional as well as intellectual, rides 
them as heavily as the Old Man of the Sea. 
They are the one-strain poets, of whom we be- 
come accustomed to expect always the same sort 
of tune. From a psychological viewpoint this 
is significant. It means that these poets have 
early in their poetic career achieved what is for 
them a satisfactory abstraction, or algebra, of 
experience. They have formed crystalline con- 
victions which will henceforth be hard, clear, and 
insoluble. In so far as we value their view- 
point, or have experienced it, we enjoy their 
work and give it a place in the gamut of our 
perceptions. But they have ceased to interest us 
as individuals, because they inform us obliquely 
that for them the problems have all been solved 
and there is no longer any flux in values. 

More interesting, therefore, is the poet who, if 
he does not always progress intellectually (a 
hard thing to determine on any absolute 
grounds), at any rate changes; he provides us 
with a personal drama as well as a literary. 
Mr. Masefield is of this sort. If we look back 
on his career as poet, we see a perspective of 
ceaseless' change. His first mood, in "Songs and 
Ballads," was unreflectingly, colorfully lyric: he 
was preoccupied with sensuous beauty, and with 
its transience, in the romantic tradition. In the 
group of novels which followed, we see a steady 



shifting of the attention away from the merely 
romantic, or decorative, and toward the real and 
human. The romantic attitude is not eliminated, 
to be sure; one feels here as later in the four 
long narrative poems which gave Mr. Masefield 
his greatest success, that though the material is 
often rudely naturalistic, it is still being used to 
an essentially romantic end. It is the romance 
of the realistic, of the crude and violent; it is 
romantic because it is always seen against a back- 
ground of permanence and beauty. This use of 
the realistic element, the vigor of the common- 
place, reached its height in "The Everlasting 
Mercy," "The Widow in the Bye Street," and 
"Dauber." In "The Daffodil Fields," which fol- 
lowed, one perceives the next change, a distinct 
relenting of the naturalistic mood, a softening of 
both material and technique nearly to the point 
of sentimentalism. The hunger for hardness 
and virility having been satisfied in a brief and 
magnificent debauch, Mr. Masefield returned to 
his more natural taste for the sensuous and lyric. 
The poetic plays which followed were further de- 
velopments of this. In spirit they are closely 
akin to the three later poetic narratives: the 
motive force, the emotional compulsion, is an al- 
most obsessive feeling for the tragic futility of 
man's endeavor in the face of an outrageous and 
apparently unreasoning fate. At this everlasting 
door, Mr. Masefield says in effect, we beat in 
vain. One perceives in Mr. Masefield, as he 
says this, an almost pathetic bewilderment that 
it should be so, but a bewilderment which has 
not yet reached the intensity of interrogation or 
rebellion. This point was finally reached in the 
sonnet series which composed the greater part of 
"Good Friday." In these one gets a blind and 
troubled searching for spiritual comfort, a cry 
for some sort of assurance that beauty is more 
than a merely transient and relative thing. The 
tone at its best is tragic, at its worst querulous. 
The oracle is dumb, however, and Mr. Mase- 
field implies, though he does not state (and in 
spite, too, of his passionate adherence to Beauty), 
that the silence is negative. 

In short Mr. Masefield's evolution as a poet 
has been cyclic it has revolved through many 
changes, but always about one centre. This 
centre, which has been at times obscured, and of 
which Mr. Masefield himself, like most poets, 
has been perhaps partially unconscious up to the 
present, is essentially romantic : it is clearly in the 
tradition of that romanticism which consists in 
a pagan love of beauty, on the one hand, and a 



56

[July 1> 



profound despair at its impcrmancncr and rela- 
tivity, on the other. The sonnets in "Good 
Friday" showed us that Mr. Masefield had be- 
come partly aware that this particular emotional 
well was the feeding spring of his whole nature: 
it was his first attempt to dip directly from the 
source. Now, in "Lollingdon Downs," he has 
completed this process. The echo of personal 
complaint which hung over the former work is 
practically eliminated. Mr. Masefield has seen 
himself in a detached way, as he might see a 
reflection ; the tone has become one of calm and 
resignation ; like Meredith he has managed a cer- 
tain degree of objectivism and can accord without 
undue desolation when Meredith exclaims 

Ah what a dusty answer gets the soul 
When hot for certainties in this our life! 

This volume has a singular and intriguing 
unity, a unity broken up by interludes and by a 
succession of changes in the angle of approach, 
and in time and place. The effect is that of a 
several-voiced music. It is panoramic, rich in 
perspective, passing all the way from lyric and 
reflective sonnets to terse poetic dialogues and 
narrative lyric almost ugly in its bareness. It 
would be idle to pretend that Mr. Masefield 
is a philosopher. He is not intellectual except 
in the sense that he is tortured by an intellectual 
issue; he is neither subtle nor profound. But 
he feels this issue intensely, and even more than 
usual he strikes music and beauty from it. On 
the technical side he has few superiors in power 
to write richly, richly not merely from the im- 
aginative point of view, but also from the melo- 
dic. He modulates vowels with great skill ; he 
knows how to temper sensuousness with vigor. 
Best of all, he is preeminently Anglo-Saxon in 
his speech. 

To pass from Mr. Masefield to Mr. Wood- 
berry is to pass from the emotional plane to the 
intellectual. In "Ideal Passion," a sonnet series 
celebrating the beauty of super-physical love, 
one might almost say supernatural, the atmos- 
phere is of so rarefied an azure as to be almost 
unbreathable. As Mr. Woodberry truly says of 
himself, 

No beast within ray flesh his lair doth keep, 
and, on the whole, we cannot help wondering 
whether it would not be better if a beast did or, 
at any rate, if Mr. Woodberry could perceive 
him. Mr. Woodberry is an aristocrat, however, 
and succeeds in ignoring him to the end. The 
result is that these sonnets concern themselves 
with a world strangely archaic and unreal, an 
anachronistic world, oddly so in this time of 



dust and glair. This is the Petrarchan and 
Dantesque tradition, even to small details: the 
beloved is referred to as M\ I.;ul\. the land- 
scape is that of Perugino, the language is quaintly 
and prettily old-fashioned. The modernist will 
be impatient with these things; he will be of- 
fended at every turn by Mr. Woodberry's nu-t- 
rical severities with words, by the frequciu\ .t 
such adjectives as "skyey," "rebukeful." 
"stretched," by such a dreadful tyranny as com- 
pels "religion" and "tradition" to rhyim- as four- 
syllabled words with "done" and "upon," or tin- 
shameless use of inversion. 

Thee rather in myself than heaven's vast light 
Flooding the daybreak, better I discern 
This is an extreme instance of the sort of inver- 
sion Mr. Woodberry is prone to use, and often, 
as in this instance, it sounds more like a literal 
translation from the Latin than like English. It 
is hard to ignore such faults. In consequence one 
cannot give a serene attention to Mr. Wood- 
berry's development of ideas, a development 
which is persuasively lucid and sometimes, in a 
cerebral fashion, beautiful. It is even at it- 
best, however, a cold and remote sort of beaut) : 
one soon gets tired of so chill a sanctity, and 
Mr. Woodberry is not so perfect an artist but 
that often, even in the most quiet precincts, the 
reader suddenly and with a start remembers hou 
long a journey he has come from reality. One 
cannot forever contemplate the sky, and even 
the most steadfast contemplation of it will not 
eliminate the earth. 

In this respect, as in others, Mr. Underwood 
is at the opposite extreme from Mr. Woodberry. 
"War Flames" is solid stuff, solidly human, vig- 
orously kinsesthetic : one feels Mr. Underwood 
stretching and thrusting with a rude pleasure 
among the massed humanities of the world. Here 
are crowds of people, armies in motion, shops, 
cloisters, hospitals, corners of battlefields, stm-t-v 
trains, personal anecdotes, effects in historic;'! 
perspective, all massed in one book and arranged, 
a little artificially, according to nationality. The 
defects are, as with most contemporary work in 
realism, artistic defects. Mr. Underwood lu- 
aimed at creating an overwhelming panorama of 
war; but instead of achieving this, he ends. In 
sheer tireless weight of creative energy-, in over- 
whelming the reader physically rather than 
emotionally. Once he has set his machinery in mo- 
tion, it grinds along with a logical momentum 
almost frightful in its persistence. One feels 
that this book is being manufactured by rule and 
schedule. There is no variety; one method pre- 



1917]

vails throughout: a slow, cumulative prose, 
monotonous, dogged, inexhaustible. In the end, 
one must break the continuity. By turning the 
pages backward and forward and reading a bit 
here and there, one is often repaid by finding 
vivid description, narrative episodes direct and 
powerful. It is, of course, prose, rising now 
and again to a sort of ordered recitative. It 
fails of being clearly poetic, as so much grand- 
sired by Whitman fails, through being prodigally 
wasteful and unselective, through relying on 
weight rather than on power. It is a little dis- 
appointing to reflect, in this connection, that it 
is the French rather than ourselves who have 
known how to appreciate what was valuable in 
Whitman, how to ignore what was weak. The 
principle of freedom, the necessity of inventing 
form for one's self, this is what Whitman has 
taught many modern French poets, and these 
poets have gone beyond Whitman in subtle and 
beautiful adaptations of rhythm to idea. In 
America, however, we are prone to mistake Whit- 
man's practice for his principle, and his prac- 
tice was, in the main, unsuccessful because 
inartistic: Whitman lacked sense of form almost 
as much as he lacked the gift of melodic line. 
It is precisely these defects which most American 
followers of Whitman imitate, apparently in the 
belief that Whitman wrote in this way because 
it was better than any other, and not, as is more 
reasonably to be considered the case, because he 
was incapable of writing otherwise. Mr. Under- 
wood is one more adherent to this lost cause and, 
like many others, provides, when all is said and 
done, a mass of rich poetic material still in the 
ore. Such work is valuable for its influence 
on the poetic consciousness of the age rather than 
for itself. It is the material for new poetic 
coinage. At the same time it would be unfair to 
Mr. Underwood not to admit that he has writ- 
ten a vivid and suggestive book, even if it is not 
entirely successful as poetry. 

Mr. Samuel Hoffenstein's first book, "Life 
Sings a Song," has the engaging quality of youth. 
Bad and good are here mixed indiscriminately, 
and if the bad outweighs the good, there is yet 
much that is, in a curiously unwarrantable way, 
very pleasant. Mr. Hoffenstein has a Mozartean 
touch in melody ; he is lyric and sensuous ; but 
he still lives in a world of mirage and illusion 
and can hardly be said to have seen either him- 
self or the world very clearly. There is a good 
deal too much of the vasty deep, the sweet, the 
dim, dreams that fade, moonlight, angels, and 
roundelays the work is perhaps one-third Hof- 



fenstein and two-thirds poetic stock. At his oc- 
casional best, however, Mr. Hoffenstein succeeds 
surprisingly well in revivifying material which 
would have seemed rather hopelessly dead. The 
title poem, for example, is a quite delightful 
specimen of this sort ; and "The Dreamer," "Que- 
rella," "A Prescience of Immortality" are also 
good. There is a precision in these which is 
elsewhere lacking. In the main, like most young 
poets, Mr. Hoffenstein is so carried away by the 
pathos of literary creation (a subtle intoxicant) 
that he forgets to stop. Mr. Hoffenstein will 
probably write better, to paraphrase one of his 
titles, "when all his dreams are cold." This may 
seem a desolate outlook, but it is really only 
Wordsworth's doctrine of "emotion remembered 
in tranquillity." The poet must quarry not in 
his present, but in his past; Mr. Hoffenstein is 
still quarrying for the most part in the sweet 
confusion of his present. CONRAD AIKEN. 



The Struggle for South American 
Trade 

BRITISH EXPLOITS IN SOUTH AMERICA: A History 
of British Activities in Exploration, Military 
Adventure, Diplomacy, Science, and Trade in 
Latin-America. By W. H. Koebel. (Century; $4.) 

Mr. W. H. Koebel who, notwithstanding his 
German-sounding name, is a thoroughgoing Eng- 
lishman has added to the fast-growing litera- 
ture of Latin American affairs half a dozen 
acceptable volumes. Further, he has served as 
editor-in-chief of the "Encyclopaedia of South 
America." He speaks with authority on all mat- 
ters pertaining to the contact of Europeans with 
Latin American resources, governments, and 
peoples. 

His "British Exploits in South America" 
covers a period of more than three hundred 
years. It opens with a picturesque account of 
the old English navigators and buccaneers who 
sailed the Spanish Main, and goes on to describe 
successively the work of the English and Irish 
Jesuits in the Spanish colonies, the British voy- 
ages of exploration in the eighteenth century, the 
development of British Guiana and the Falkland 
Islands, the exploits of the British in Brazil, the 
part taken by Englishmen in the wars of inde- 
pendence, the early relations of the English with 
the new republics, and the deeds of innumerable 
adventurous British travellers, traders, natural- 
ists, and soldiers of fortune. The author gives

THE DIAL 



[Jul> 



evidence of an easy command of rich resources 
of memoirs, diaries, correspondence, and old books 
of travel and history; he has a keen sense of 
character; and his chapters make interesting 
reading. 

Three aspects of British operations in South 
America, especially since the early nineteenth 
century, are emphasized. The first is the large 
part played by capital. Within two decades, two 
or three hundred million pounds passed from 
Lombard Street to the newly founded Latin 
American states, and the stream has never ceased 
to flow. British investments south of Panama 
are to-day not far from seven hundred millions, 
insuring a substantial, though beneficent, finan- 
cial dominion. The second feature is the excep- 
tional ease with which the Englishman adapted 
himself to his surroundings and took root in 
South American countries. 

It is the fashion to accuse the Englishman abroad 
of the unsocial crime of keeping himself to himself. 
This, I think, must apply in a far lesser degree to 
South America than to any other part of the world. 
There is no doubt that the average Englishman in 
South America entertains an affection for that con- 
tinent and its inhabitants deeper than the inevitable 
regard with which the successful man contemplates 
the source of his wealth. Intermarriage has been fre- 
quent: common interests in sports, games, pastoral 
and agricultural occupations have led to an intimate 
understanding. 

A third fact is that almost all of the British 
achievements in South America have been the 
work of free lances. This was true in the ro- 
mantic days of Elizabeth, "when on the one hand 
the Queen gave Drake god-speed and scarfs em- 
broidered with well-wishes, and on the other 
hand condoled with Philip of Spain on the deeds 
of her irrepressible sailors." It was true of the 
British activities which had so much to do with 
stimulating and guiding the nineteenth century 
movement for independence. It was true, in the 
main, of British financial and commercial expan- 
sion in the South American world after 1820. 

The portion of Mr. Koebel's book which will 
chiefly interest students of international politics 
is a final chapter entitled "Today and Tomor- 
row in South America." The chapter is devoted 
mainly to a discussion of the commercial situation 
and outlook. It is pointed out that during recent 
decades, notwithstanding the sentimental advan- 
tages which the British have enjoyed in Latin 
America over every nationality save the Latins, 
British trade as compared with the trade of the 
rest of the world has decreased ; and the author 
urges a number of expedients to check the de- 
cline, chiefly the reorganization of the legations 



at the American capitals so as to include a much 
larger number of carefully selected commercial 
attaches. 

The lost ground has gone mainly to Germany 
and the United States. The German position in 
South America is analyzed at some length. There 
is no such easy rapprochement between the Ger- 
mans and the Latin Americans as between the 
British and the Latin Americans. "An inherent 
and unquenchable antagonism exists between the 
arrogance of the Prussian and the easy democracy 
of the South American." None the less, by art- 
ful and dauntless enterprise, the German has 
absorbed a large proportion of the Latin Amer- 
ican trade, has planted colonies on Latin Amer- 
ican soil, and by 1914 had begun to direct the 
course of affairs in more than one Latin Amer- 
ican state. Everything has been carefully 
planned and directed by public authorities, noth- 
ing left to chance. The war has upset the Ger- 
man calculations and roused the Latin American 
peoples to a new degree of anti-German feeling. 
The author feels, therefore, that now is the time 
to overcome the disadvantages which Great 
Britain has suffered, and to prepare against the 
probable revival of German "predatory trade" 
after the restoration of peace. 

American competition is viewed very differ- 
ently. 

To forsake the topic of the German trade hostilities 
for that of the North American competition is to ex- 
perience the sensations of one emerging from an en- 
tangled forest path on to an open high-road. Yet 
this affords no reasons for regarding it lightly. The 
North American competition with which we have to 
contend is straightforward, of a fairly simple order, 
but very powerful. It relies for its success largely 
on a sheer weight of dollars. It enjoys forming a 
trust and buying up the control of an entire trade. 
. . In its industrial enterprise, moreover, it has 
set itself a very high standard if not quite so lofty 
an ideal of political morality at Panama. The North 
American has already given ample proof that he 
means business very big business in the South. But, 
seeing that no question of imperial aggression is con- 
cerned, there would seem no reason why his ventures 
and those of the British should not thrive side by side. 

The main handicap, Mr. Koebel feels, upon 
American enterprise in South America is unfami- 
liarity with South American languages, customs, 
and institutions. The newcomer from the 
United States, he very properly says, finds it diffi- 
cult to realize how many races teem, ami how 
many rivers run, between New York and Buenos 
Aires. He recognizes, however, that the Pan- 
American Union and other agencies are doing 
much to remedy this defect; and it is probable 
that the obstacles are disappearing more rapidly 
than he realizes. FREDERIC AUSTIN OGG.

The Vitality of Thoreau 

THE LIFE OF HENRY DAVID THOREAU. By 
Frank B. Sanborn. (Houghton Mifflin Co.; $4.) 

This book is the offering of Thoreau's author- 
ized publishers in this centenary year, and is 
announced somewhat tautologically as "final and 
definitive." If this is true, Thoreau's name 
must be added to the list of men whose lives 
can never be written. Fond of paradox and 
hyperbole himself, he seems to have been the 
cause of paradox and hyperbole in others. Em- 
erson's "Memoir" and Channing's rambling 
"Life" abound in striking and epigrammatic 
statements which whet rather than gratify our 
curiosity regarding the man whom they would 
portray, and which, like most epigrams, are not 
always literally true. Salt's biography and San- 
born's earlier volume in the "American Men of 
Letters Series" record the facts of Thoreau's 
career, and many critics and essayists have had 
their say regarding his life and personality. The 
present volume makes some valuable contribu- 
tions to our knowledge. But after all, we are 
never certain that we fully understand Thoreau. 
It is not so much that he seems a mystic, in- 
capable of comprehension, but rather that we 
feel uncertain as to data and their significance, 
doubtful whether our informants have inter- 
preted word and act and gesture as we might 
have interpreted them. 

It was fitting that Frank B. Sanborn should 
write this book on this occasion, and it is for- 
tunate that he lived to read almost the final 
proofs, though not to see it from the press. He 
was the last surviving intimate of Thoreau and 
of Thoreau's group at Concord, and Thoreau 
was perhaps the man for whom he had the 
greatest admiration. Mr. Traubel reports 
Whitman as saying: "I asked Sanborn . . . 
who of all men of Concord was most likely to 
last, into the future. Sanborn took his time in 
replying. I thought he was going to say Emer- 
son, but he didn't. He said Thoreau. I was 
surprised looked at him asked 'Is that your 
deliberate judgment?' and he said very emphat- 
ically, 'Yes !' " One may conjecture that San- 
born never changed his mind. His latest work 
is a combination of biography, interpretation, 
and personal tribute. The unexpected lapses 
into the first person, and the autobiographic ref- 
erences which might seem blemishes in another 
book only add to its attractiveness. It has, how- 
ever, grave limitations. Like the author's earlier 



and briefer treatment of the same subject, it is 
by no means a book for the seeker after ordinary 
biographical information. While it gives a be- 
wildering amount of family history, and a fairly 
minute account of some parts of Thoreau's life, 
its omissions are surprising. For example, one 
searches in vain for the date of the residence at 
Walden, or any details regarding that experience. 
It seems to begin on one plan and end on an- 
other, and is wofully unsystematic. 

Lowell wrote of Thoreau in 1865: "We think 
greater compression would have done more for 
his fame. A feeling of sameness comes over us 
as we read so much." At that time six volumes 
of Thoreau's writings had appeared, including 
his "Letters." One wonders what Lowell would 
say to-day, when admirers and publishers have 
insisted that every scrap of manuscript that he 
left should be given to the public. The excuse 
for a great part of this publication is plain. 
Thoreau left journals and commonplace books 
filled with material, much of which he would 
surely have prepared for the press had he lived. 
This was too good to be lost, yet no one could 
say just what selections and revisions he would 
have made. Excerpts by an editor, like the vol- 
umes published with the titles of the seasons, 
were bound to be unsatisfactory. The publica- 
tion of the complete journals, though it over- 
whelmed the reader with a mass of material 
uneven in quality and filled with endless repeti- 
tion of similar details, had the justification that 
it enabled him to make his own selections and 
do his own editing. There seems to be less 
reason for printing the college essays and the 
notebook of the trip to Minnesota in 1861 which 
are made a conspicuous part of the present vol- 
ume. The notebook contains the jottings kept 
by an overtaxed traveller in the late stages of a 
fatal disease, and is of little value for content 
or form. The college essays, though interesting 
as examples of Harvard themes of eighty years 
ago, seem less significant than the biographer 
deems them. They show Thoreau to have been 
an apt pupil, and his progress may well have 
been a source of pride to his instructor, Professor 
Channing; but they throw little light on the de- 
velopment of his finished style. Sanborn makes 
much of their paradoxical statements; but love 
of paradox is not an uncommon trait in college 
students, and it is undergraduate paradox that 
we find here, rather than the individual and 
whimsical sort that appears in Walden. No- 
where are there hints of the perfect diction and 



60 



THE DIAL 



[July l' 



the flowing sentences that linger in our minds 
when we meet them in the later essays and jour- 
nals, and that somehow move us like reaches of 
still and shaded waters. Moreover, the pub- 
lishers tell us that Sanborn, in dealing with writ- 
ings which Thoreau did not himself prepare for 
publication, "used the privilege of an editor who 
is thoroughly familiar with his author's subjects 
and habits of thought to rearrange paragraphs, 
to omit here, to make slight interpolations there, 
and otherwise to treat the rough and unpolished 
sentences of the Journals, letters, etc., much as 
it may be supposed the author himself would 
have treated them had he prepared them for the 
press." If he has taken liberties like these with 
the essays and the notebooks, he has destroyed 
even the slight value they might have had as 
documents. 

But if the new biography fails to reveal the 
secrets of personality as we might wish, it still 
reminds us how vital and important a figure 
Thoreau is in American literature a hundred 
years after his birth. The view of his contem- 
poraries, that he was a mere understudy and 
imitator of Emerson, has disappeared so com- 
pletely that it is hardly mentioned to be denied. 
He was a man of somewhat eccentric character, 
driven by his Yankee humor and his innate in- 
dependence to mystify a gossipy New England 
village and the wider circle of his readers by 
accentuating the appearance of eccentricity. The 
slight recognition that his works received did 
not encourage publication in his lifetime, and his 
career was early cut short; so that he is known 
by writings in which he is sometimes guilty of 
trying to pique attention, and by a mass of post- 
humously published material which is surely not 
in the form that he would have given it. That 
such work of such a man should continue for 
over half a century to give an increasing sense 
of its importance is proof of qualities that may 
well be lasting. 

Thoreau has a double hold a fascination for 
those who love Nature not as a fad or a pleas- 
ant-day diversion but in all her aspects, and an 
interest for those who respond to his unsystem- 
atic but fairly intelligible philosophy of life. A 
book like his "Week" might be separated into 
two works a delightful chronicle of a journey, 
and a set of moralizing essays. A passage of de- 
scription and a passage of moralizing is the 
formula, and often there is no close relation 
between the particular moral idea and the par- 
ticular scene by the river-bank with which it is 



associated. Stevenson might have attained some- 
what the same effect if he had interlarded 
"Tra\els with a Donkey" at random with pages 
from "Virginibus Puerisque." The most devout 
admirers of the author enjoy both elements 
equally; but there are many who are moved 
chiefly by his sympathetic comment on the 
homely things of Nature, and by the less striking 
and erratic of the passages in which he preaches 
the "simple life." To these last, at least, San- 
born will appeal less strongly than some earlier 
commentators. A feature of the book too im- 
portant to be ignored is the illustrations, mostly 
reproductions of old family pictures, which to 
those who can interpret them are far better than 
pages of letterpress in giving an idea of the 
Thoreaus and their kin.

Federalists and Republicans 

A HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. By Edward 
Channing. Vol. IV. The Federalists and Re- 
publicans. (Macmillan Co.; $2.50.) 

Professor Channing goes resolutely forward 
with his great undertaking, a history of the 
United States to the end of the nineteenth cen- 
tury, in spite of wars and distractions that mi^ht 
deter a less devoted historian. The present vol- 
ume treats the period from 1789 to 1815. The 
third volume presented the story of the Revolu- 
tion and the reaction to 1789; while the two 
preceding instalments were devoted to the two 
centuries of colonial history. At this rate \\e 
shall have a new history of the country in eL'ht 
volumes, although the proportions of the subjects 
to be treated must necessarily make it difficult to 
say how much space should be given to them. 

A new history of the United States after this 
fashion is a formidable undertaking and Mr. 
Channing makes it plain that he is fully aware 
of the fact. The materials are abundant, too 
abundant for any but the most industrious; the 
variety of social groups to be described is great ; 
and the conflicting interests are manifold. Thus 
far the author has apparently devoted fifteen 
years to his task and has brought out four vol- 
umes of some six hundred pages each. To com- 
plete his task fifteen more years must be devoted 
to research. Thirty years to a work which must 
of necessity be antiquated before it is finished! 
That is the problem and the recompense of the 
historian; for all the larger histories of our 
country which have appeared in the last two 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



61 



decades were out of date before they were com- 
pleted. 

Nor is this to be lamented. Each generation 
must have its history anew, and that history must 
have some bearing on the present, much as some 
scholars deprecate that demand of the public. 
It is not so only with history proper ; it is so 
with biography. There are less than a dozen 
biographies in the whole field of American history 
that can be said to stand on permanent founda- 
tions. Of Washington, Jefferson, Clay, Lin- 
coln, and the rest we have only the frameworks 
of biographies, not reproductions of the men as 
they lived and wrestled with men and conditions. 
There is room, then, for all that Mr. Channing 
can bring out, even if his work must of necessity 
be submitted to a generation that runs so fast 
that it cannot read. 

In the volume before us Professor Channing 
treats with sympathy both Hamilton and Jeffer- 
son, opposite as they were to each other. He 
still adheres to the view that Hamilton's financial 
measures composed a magnificent system, perhaps 
underestimating the fact that union itself made 
the system necessary and that the tariff, with 
which Madison had much to do, was the under- 
pinning of the whole financial structure. While 
Hamilton was doubtless a great figure, it must 
not be forgotten that the social forces already 
organized would have made even a smaller man 
great. But I must hasten to say that Mr. Chan- 
ning is no panegyrist either of Hamilton or of 
Washington himself. 

He is not afraid of the facts and the facts are 
duly brought out. The Secretary of the Treas- 
ury is shown to have been the centre of a con- 
siderable number of petty intrigues of specula- 
tors and narrow-minded partisans, whose purpose 
was to exploit their opportunities and the coun- 
try. Hamilton's many bouts with John Adams, 
his efforts to control Washington or to exploit 
his reputation as against the President's in 1798, 
are given all due publicity. But it may be 
doubted whether Professor Channing has read 
President Wilson's statement that Hamilton was 
a great man, but not a great American. 

Of the arch radical, Jefferson, Channing has 
even more to say than of Hamilton; but it may 
be doubted whether he knows what a "root and 
branch" reformer the Third President was when 
a leader in Virginia. At least, such knowledge 
does not appear in this volume. Henry Adams 
thinks Jefferson would rather have seen the world 
go up in smoke than that America should be- 



come only another Europe, a place where poor 
men are exploited for the benefit of their more 
fortunate fellows. Channing has not been im- 
pressed by that view. He has not pointed out 
that Jefferson was so hated by true gentlemen of 
Virginia that prayers were piously said for his 
demise. W 7 hile slaveholders associated with the 
Jefferson party, they did it with fear and trem- 
bling, much as "malefactors of great wealth" 
hold on to the coat tails of Woodrow Wilson. 
Their only alternative was the downright enemy, 
John Adams, or the star-gazing Virginian. 
They took the Virginian, hoping either to con- 
trol or to confound him. While this is not said 
in criticism of Channing, it is suggested that at 
least one feature of the story has been slurred. 

Of the Alien and Sedition laws the author 
offers just and adequate treatment. He makes it 
plain that they were a sort of party platform, as 
indeed were the resolutions of the Hartford con- 
vention. The essential weakness of the con- 
stitution in those early days is made sufficiently 
plain ; but it is not made quite so plain that, in 
vital matters, the rights of the states were deemed 
by able and patriotic leaders always paramount 
to the rights and interests of the Federal Gov- 
ernment. Any close reading of Jefferson, Mad- 
ison, Josiah Quincy, or George Cabot reveals the 
fact that the Union was a union of convenience, 
which, to be sure, all regarded as of great impor- 
tance for the building of an American nation, 
but which few regarded as commanding the ab- 
solute allegiance of men. If the principles of 
the Federalists are to prevail, then Jefferson 
would rather have the Union disrupted; if the 
country is to embrace all the Mississippi valley 
and thus make of New England only a province, 
then Quincy or Cabot would prefer separation 
from the Virginia dynasty and its "vile dal- 
liance" with slavery. 

This is not made so plain in Channing that the 
wayfaring man may see and understand ; and 
attention needs to be called to the subject, be- 
cause failure to grip these facts may lead to 
unhistorical treatment of later and more contro- 
verted epochs. 

The history of the war of 1812 is correctly 
set forth, at least so far as the facts go. It was 
no war for sailors' rights, successfully waged 
against the greatest naval power in the world. 
It was a war such as a democracy must of neces- 
sity wage, one of blunders, of personal disgraces, 
and brilliant individual exploits. It produced 
the piddling Henry Dearborn and it brought to

light the heroic Andrew Jackson. It saw the 
ignominious fall of Washington and the distress- 
ing incidents which accompanied the fall. It also 
saw the valiant defence of Balitmore by citizen 
soldiers. Professor Channing deserves the credit 
due the honest historian for telling the truth 
about the militia, which was neither all poltroon 
nor all heroic. In the light of recent so-called 
military history, one might have been tempted to 
accept what is in the air and solemnly pronounce 
verdicts of condemnation upon men whose lives 
and conduct were as honorable as any of those 
who died at Bunker Hill or Gettysburg. The 
facts of the war are correctly if briefly set forth. 
They are not conducive to a sense of national 
superiority; they do not place us below the other 
peoples in the world who have sought to govern 
themselves. 

Of the causes of the war the present volume 
gives an equally truthful and straightforward 
account. It was the westerner who first cried 
out for a declaration of hostilities, and it was the 
West that supplied the greatest number of 
soldiers and the best fighting men. The South 
was next in interest; in part because there was 
a bitter popular feeling in that region against 
England on account of the atrocities of the rev- 
olutionary struggle. Still, as we are plainly told, 
these were not the decisive influences. The con- 
quest of Canada and Florida was a leading mo- 
tive for the war; it was natural that this should 
be so, for the best way to rid the country of the 
Indians, who were always ready for a foray into 
the settlements, was to attack their allies. The 
Indians naturally looked to England or Spain for 
arms and for markets for their peltries. This 
made war upon England for Canada natural; 
it made war upon England for Florida natural, 
because England was the ally of Spain against 
Napoleon. Hence America became an enemy 
of England and a supporter of Napoleon at a 
time when the fortunes of the world seemed to 
be in the balance and when Americans were not 
admirers of the French emperor. It was a fate- 
ful step to take; but the conditions in North 
America decreed it. 

Perhaps Professor Channing will not com- 
plain if I say that his making of Clay, Calhoun, 
Grundy, and R. M. Johnson southerners is in- 
consistent with the rest of his story of the war. 
Although these men were born in the South, they 
were as far from John Randolph and Charles 
Pinclcney in ideal and purpose as Jefferson was 
foreign to Rufus King. It was as a westerner 



that Clay sang his song of "Canada. Canada" 
in Congress till John Randolph's political stom- 
ach was turned. It was as a westerner that Cal- 
houn thundered nationalism at the East and even 
talked of the treason of New England. The 
West and South had been allies since the adop- 
tion of the constitution; but the official spoke- 
men of the alliance in 1810-11, Madison, Gal- 
latin, and the rest, seeking always to get on 
without war and without alienating the East had 
got out of touch with common men of the West 
and the southern up-country. Clay and Cal- 
houn and, for that matter, Porter of New York, 
undertook to wake them up and restore them 
to their political base. 

Thus when Monroe went into Madison's cab- 
inet, it was in obedience to a popular demand 
from West and South and with the purpose of 
changing the base of the administration, as any 
one may see who reads the letters of John Tay- 
lor of Caroline, the good angel of Monroe's 
career, who brought the wayward Virginian 
back to his former friendly relation to the Pres- 
ident. The publication of the Henry letters, at 
a cost of the exorbitant sum of fifty thousand 
dollars, was due warning that the Administration 
had changed its mind. Then came Clay and 
Calhoun and Grundy and Porter and drove the 
war machine into action. Some have said that 
they exacted a declaration of war from timid 
Madison as a condition of his reelection to the 
presidency in 1812. Channing denies this stoutly 
and with good documentary support. Madison 
had, indeed, seen the writing on the wall. Still, 
one may doubt very much whether the President 
could have interpreted the writing but for his 
hard-pressing western friends. 

The following quotation, pages 15-16, from 
this volume may bring the author some embar- 
rassment: "Whether alcohol quickened or 
dimmed their [Madison, Jefferson, and King] 
intellects would probably best be left for decision 
to others. What effect it produced on their 
bodily health is also an interesting inquiry and 
one upon which conclusion would be quite as 
difficult. King died at the age of seventy-two. 
Jefferson at eighty-three and Madison at eighty- 
five, after years of service unsurpassed each in 
his way." If the American Liquor Dealers A 
sociation does not jump at this proof of the 
good effects of partaking of the "good tiling ot 
life, it will be because its press agents do not 
look to the pages ot irravc and sober historians 
for support of their cause.

Professor Channing's work is a little difficult 
to appraise justly. It is substantial, informing, 
and useful; one could not well afford to leave 
it off one's shelves. Yet there is little, if any- 
thing, new in it. Perhaps this is as it should be 
in such a work. Nor are there new interpreta- 
tions or evidences of very keen insight. The mean- 
ing of Federalism in its later years is overlooked. 
And the election of the Republicans in 1800 is 
treated just as one might treat the success of the 
Democrats in the later decades of the nineteenth 
century that is, as a mere change of parties. 
The shift of John Quincy Adams from Federal- 
ism to Republicanism in 1807, while a personal 
matter in some respects, was a significant thing, 
so significant that many people called it the 
"great apostasy." Since Henry Adams, in all 
his nine volumes, did not find space to set this 
matter straight, it might have been made clear in 
Channing. A larger and even momentous thing, 
the purchase of Louisiana, is treated as an 
episode : the significance of Louisiana is not made 
clear, its bearing on slavery and the slave trade, 
on the development of the Union itself is not 
dwelt upon. 

Nor is the reason for the break between Jeffer- 
son and his southern supporters in 1807 made 
evident to the reader. The reason for the au- 
thor's not seeing this is that he regards Jefferson 
simply as a party leader and a shrewd statesman, 
not as a social reformer bent on leaving his coun- 
try "in the way of becoming democratic." The 
slave trade was prohibited by Federal law in 
1807, but Professor Channing does not show- 
that the law was as futile as the more recent 
Sherman anti-trust law and that African slaves 
continued to be sold in southern towns till 1861. 
This is not to say that the facts are not well 
set forth, only the meaning of the facts is not 
brought out. The struggle over the law against 
the slave trade and the substantial nullification 
of that law in the provisions for its execution are 
evidences of things not so well noted as one 
should expect from so great a scholar as our 
author is known to be. 

Still, we should not quarrel with those who 
serve us and the public in general so well as 
Professor Channing does. If his work fails to 
show, as one might wish, the evolution of society 
in America, the meaning of events, and the influ- 
ences of ideas, it is a useful reference work, an 
ever-ready friend in time of need, which all who 
are interested in American history should hasten 
to buy.

The ^Dramatist of Psycho-Analysis 

COMEDIES OF WORDS. By Arthur Schnitzler. 
Translated by Pierre Loving. (Stewart & Kidd ; 

$1.50.) 

A translation of Schnitzler's einakters has a 
more than timely interest. For fifteen years he 
has been one of the most-followed teachers to a 
large school of playwrights who have been sup- 
plying the intimate playhouses of Europe with 
realistic short pieces, and recently his influence 
has been extended to the young American dram- 
atists whose one-act plays are being presented in 
our own Little Theatres. 

In this volume are collected interesting ex- 
amples of his recent work, the three plays pub- 
lished two years ago with "Literature" (1901) 
and "His Helpmate" (1898). It is a pity that 
the excellent translations should have a most un- 
satisfactory introduction. Schnitzler is not so 
well known in America that an intelligent, de- 
tailed study of his one-act plays is unnecessary, 
but all that is given the inquiring reader is an 
elaborately worded jumble of praise and uncer- 
tain conclusions. Mr. Loving's translations of 
the plays themselves, however, are capital. At 
times he is unnecessarily free (as when he trans- 
lates ist nun einmal zu verachten, "isn't to be 
ground down with the heel of one's foot"), and 
he makes a few careless mistakes (kassiererin, a 
woman cashier, becomes a "coffee-dispenser") ; 
but his English is so finely idiomatic and he repro- 
duces the spirit of the original so well that we 
can forgive these little slips and even overlook his 
introduction. 

The first thing to strike the reader of these 
plays is that the plot of every one has a sexual 
basis. Taken alone each situation is perfectly 
possible ; taken as a collection they are unnatural. 
I mention this obvious fact because it can be used 
advantageously in examining the individual plays. 
Each character, w r hen singled out, is a living in- 
dividual; but the characters of any play with 
the possible exception of the trio in "The Fes- 
tival of Bacchus" are an unreal group of human 
exceptions. They are all aberrant, and in spite 
of the highly realistic style, we feel certain that 
such erotic persons never found themselves to- 
gether in such a situation. We miss "the average 
man." 

To comprehend this characteristic of his work 
we must remember that Schnitzler is a practising 
physician, a specialist in psychology, a student of 
Freud. He is so keenly interested in patholog- 



64 



THE DIAL 



[Jul> 



ical psychology that the normal human being does 
not interest him at all. Believing that the sexual 
instinct is the most powerful impulse man has, he 
naturally finds it the most available dramatic 
theme. In his study of his characters, however, 
there is no morbid curiosity, but a scientific spirit 
of investigation, and this impersonal point of 
view broadens and raises up all his work. In the 
hands of most European playwrights his farce of 
moral hypocrisy, "Literature," with its shrewd 
hits at the proverbial artistic temperament, would 
be nothing more than a naughty joke; but he 
makes it an ironical satire. His imitators are 
often Peeping Toms: Schnitzler is always the 
examining physician. Nor must we forget that 
he is a Viennese, deftly clever and gaily cynical, 
glorying in the worldly wisdom of that most 
sophisticated of capitals. No modern playwright 
owes more to his environment and training than 
does Arthur Schnitzler. 

Praise has been lavished upon Schnitzler's 
adroit dramatic craftsmanship, but the artistry 
of his one-act plays rests upon firmer foundations 
than a clever choice of words, an impressively 
naturalistic manner, and a mastery of technique. 
The finest effects in his dialogue are due to his 
uncanny skill in following the quick turns and 
sudden jumps that the mind makes during con- 
versation. His people are "always coming out 
with the most unexpected things," and often they 
think ahead over two or three speeches that a less 
discerning dramatist would laboriously record. 
The scenes between the two runaways in "The 
Festival of Bacchus" and between Margaret and 
her old lover in "Literature" are full of examples 
of these qualities, qualities that give Schnitzler's 
dialogue vivid naturalness and brilliancy. His 
fine dialogue is even surpassed by his technical 
skill, and yet in some of his short plays there is 
an obviousness in exposition that is quite unex- 
pected. His technical forte is the light handling 
of the new and unexpected twists to the action, 
and one can never be certain how the shortest 
scene will end. In that study of disillusionment, 
"His Helpmate," Professor Pilgram buries his 
wife knowing that she has been unfaithful to 
him ; and he welcomes her lover, prepared to 
sympathize with a loss keener than his own, onlf 
to discover that the lover is already engaged to 
another woman. He orders him out, denouncing 
him as the faithless betrayer of his wife, only to 
learn that she had known of the engagement and 
accepted it as a matter of course. In "The Hour 
of Recognition," Dr. Eckold has for fifteen >r.ir- 



known of his wife's affair with a man whom she 
had loved too well to have any affair with. 
Sophie, in "The Big Scene," decides to leave her 
husband because he hushes up too skilfully a scan- 
dal that she wanted to avoid. Out of such iron- 
ical material does Schnit/ler make his best 
technical device. With him, however, these 
turns in the action are not theatrical tricks, nor 
is he intentionally cruel to his characters. 

Before he is stylist, before he is technician, 
Schnitzler is a specialist in psychology. His 
specialist's point of view is at once his strength 
and his weakness.

The Spanking of Transcend en fa list 
Egotism 

EGOTISM IK GERMAN PHILOSOPHY. By George 
Santayana. (J. M. Dent & Sons; $1.) 

Egotism, says Mr. Santayana, is "subjecti\ ity 
in thought and wilfulness in morals." It regards 
life as a continuous soliloquy, a rhapsody of dis- 
course; it is marked by a craving for adventure, 
an incapacity to learn, a dependence on magic. 
It refuses to pass beyond the relativity of the 
human mind: for it nothing exists but itselt. 
It is for that reason idealistic, but not concerned 
with ideals, and progress is for it nothing but 
"the vital joy of transition." Obviously such a 
way of thinking cannot be sincere ; in one or an- 
other it must acknowledge and defer to the real- 
ities it denies. It has, hence, an inner duplicity. 
and all its terms are ambiguous. 

The effect of such a way of thinking on the 
German people is to restore them to a primitive 
and pathetic heathenism, and to inure them 
to a ludicrous arrogance. They are by nature 
"simple, honest, kindly, easily pleased. There is 
no latent irony of disbelief in their souls. The 
pleasures of sense, plain and copious, they enjoy 
hugely, long labor does not exasperate them, sci- 
ence fills them with satisfaction, music entrances 
them. There ought to be no happier or more 
innocent nation in this world. Unfortunately, 
their very goodness and simplicity render them 
helpless; they are what they are d rationed to he. 
There is no social or intellectual disease to which, 
in spots, they do not succumb, as to an epidemic : 
their philosophy i> an example of this." 

And their philosophy is a w<>rk having genius 
precisely because it pierces back through civili/a- 
tion and history, through all the accumulated

wisdom of tradition and experience to the blind, 
primitive instinct, impulse, and imagination 
which are the aboriginal animal stuff of all hu- 
man life. This it glorifies and exalts and in this 
glorification and exaltation its heathenism con- 
sists. For to be heathen is to be without "author- 
itative wisdom," to be without a book or chart of 
life, to remain untaught of experience. Heathen- 
ism is a "religion of will, the faith which life has 
in itself because it is life, and in its aims because 
it is pursuing them." The animals are heathen: 
German philosophy and Germanism are heathen. 
From Luther to Schopenhauer and from Goethe 
to Nietzsche they are heathen. Their essence is 
animal egotism turned into a dogma, hypostatized 
as a mission. In substance, the doctrine of the 
German mission is Protestant theology rational- 
ized. Individuals give way in it to institutions 
and nations: so the German people are declared 
by Fichte and Hegel to be the chosen people of 
Providence. Supernatural personages give way 
to hypostatized social facts; Biblical piety is 
secularized and consecrates social and patriotic 
zeal. God becomes vital energy; freedom, per- 
sonality; immortality, social progress. Every- 
thing goes by two names: one its "real," or 
transcendental, the other its relative manifesta- 
tion. Consequence: "the transcendental theory 
of a world merely imagined by the ego, and the 
will that deems itself absolute, are certainly des- 
perate delusions; but not more desperate or de- 
luded than many another system that millions 
have been brought to accept. The thing bears 
all the marks of a new religion. The fact that 
the established religions of Germany are still 
forms of Christianity may obscure the explicit 
and heathen character of the new faith; it passes 
for a somewhat faded speculation, or for the 
creed of a few extremists, when in reality it 
dominates the judgment and conduct of the 
nation. No religious tyranny could be more com- 
plete. It has its prophets in the great philoso- 
phers and historians of the last century; its high 
priests and Pharisees in the government and the 
professors; its faithful flock in the disciplined 
mass of the nation; its heretics in the socialists; 
its dupes in the Catholics and the liberals, to 
both of whom the national creed, if they un- 
derstood it, would be an abomination ; it has its 
martyrs now by the million, and its victims 
among unbelievers are even more numerous, for 
its victims, in some degree, are all men." 

The passages just transcribed and the other 
passages cited hardly do justice to the brilliancy, 



the incisiveness, and the cruelty of this remark- 
able book. Surveying as it does in a few pages 
the whole growth of historic German thought, it 
cannot help, in spite of the evident Tightness of 
its central theses, working injustice by omissions 
and dogmatic assertions, such as are surprising 
from a writer usually so just and urbane as Mr. 
Santayana. The work is really too sketchy and 
too abstract and its tone too biting and passion- 
ate to carry the conviction that is due the truths it 
expresses. These qualities make the truths seem 
even less than half-truths and the book partisan. 
It should be supplemented with John Dewey's 
"German Philosophy and the War." The two 
together will give a fairly adequate idea of the 
influence of philosophic thinking on the motives 
and institutions of men.

Rediscovery and Romance 

LIMEHOUSE NIGHTS: Tales of Chinatown. By 
Thomas Burke. (London: Grant Richards; 6s.) 
NIGHTS IN TOWN: A London Autobiography. By 
Thomas Burke. (London: Allen & Unwin; 7s.) 

The two substantial books of tales and 
sketches of London which Mr. Thomas Burke 
has collected and published since the war began 
are of a stuff which the world may find out- 
moded in the unhappy years to come. They are 
books which might have become only items in the 
"new literature" of the century's second decade 
had the revolution of war not prevented, for Mr. 
Burke is not only one of those who rediscovered 
romance ; he is also of those who taste to the full 
the romance of their own rediscovery. 

Some fifteen tales of Limehouse, the Chinese 
quarter of London in "the thunderous shadows 
of the great Dock," and some twenty sketches 
of London complete Mr. Burke's present contri- 
bution. To write about Chinatown is a repor- 
ter's holiday; to write about London, giving 
yourself no limitations but that of the mystic 
city itself, and to write with love and care and 
beauty, is a hard and bitter labor, no matter what 
talents you may have. Mr. Burke's pass- 
ing repute comes from the tales of terror which 
the libraries were compelled to bar from their 
shelves ; but to those who have some respect for 
the English tongue and for whom Walter Pater 
has not lived in vain, Mr. Burke will always 
possess an attraction because he has written well 



66 



THE DIAL 



[July 19 



his slight sketches of London life. In both 
these books one hears the cry of a great joy. 
At the age of ten the author was taken with the 
flaring beauty of a fried-fish shop, throwing a 
warm light and a glamour over the dusky pave- 
ment of a London slum; and since then he has 
been passing from discovery to discovery, rejoic- 
ing that these things, these common and tawdry 
things, are still in existence for him to discover 
again. He knows well that they were revealed 
long since, but he makes fresh starts and every- 
thing is new and beautiful to him. 

Because everything is strange to him, Mr. 
Burke never quite succeeds in his tales of China- 
town. He writes of Limehouse as Pierre Loti 
writes of Annam and of Iceland, with the heart 
of a wanderer who will not be consoled for his 
separation from home. Lust and wildness, 
cruelty, perversion and madness, things unclean 
to the white man's heart, make up the themes of 
his stories. He has continually to drive his 
plots with little daggers of exaggeration because 
he is always impressed with the uncommonness 
of the people of whom he writes. Will it be 
the story of a burglar's wife who tries to betray 
her husband to the police so that she may be free 
to love his accomplice, or the story of a girl who 
loses caste by going with a Chinaman in order to 
pay her mother's funeral expenses? The reality 
of his events does not satisfy the author ; he must 
try to be convincing by a turn of the plot, so 
that we get the ten-cent magazine type of sud- 
den and perverse denouement. It is not the hus- 
band but the lover who is killed by the police; 
the girl gets her revenge by a neat trick, revealed 
in the last line of the story. 

These "Limehouse Nights" appeared in three 
of the most interesting periodicals of England: 
"The English Review," "Colour," and "The 
New Witness," and I can hardly imagine the 
editor of any one of them insisting that Mr. 
Burke get more punch or pep into his work. I 
arrt afraid he is really to blame for his shortcom- 
ings. 

He is certainly to be credited with his good 
things, because he seems a writer with no deriva- 
tions. Ambrose Bierce might have written some 
of these tales, but you cannot trace Burke to 
Bierce, because you are in the presence of a sin- 
gularly powerful inspiration with which literary 
affinities have very little to do. Mr. Arthur 



Machen, the unknown master of the artistic tale 
of terror, probably returns Mr. Burke's evident 
admiration. One suggests these names to comcv 
a bit more clearly the quality of Mr. Burke's 
stories; that is all. 

Strange and terrible stories, one hesitates to 
retell them, not because it would be unjust, for 
these are good stories and the outline of a good 
tale will always bear repetition. But they are 
about things we are none of us too anxious to 
name, and which Mr. Burke makes tolerable only 
by the flooding beauty of his telling and the 
human kindness of his spirit. He knows at least 
that one must not call down the gods of terror 
without praying softly to the gods of pity. 1 take 
one tale, an artist's story of those famous Sidney 
Street murders in which the world was once 
absorbed, those murderers for whose capture the 
soldiery of England was called out, against whom 
a street became a barricade and a funeral pyre. 
Mr. Burke calls it "Beryl, the Croucher and the 
Rest of England." He starts you with the 
Croucher, a slugging prize-fighter, and Beryl, 
the girl whom he buys in a fit of drunkenness. 
He tells you how the Croucher's father broke 
in upon their assignation with the news that he 
had killed a man, and how the Croucher, putting 
lust aside, makes a barricade in the procurer's 
room and fights to the end. But what an end 
when, days later, he rushes from the burning 
room into Beryl's arms. "There was talk, 
curious talk, the talk of a woman of thirty to 
the man of her life, monstrous to hear from a 
child to a boy of nineteen. There were em- 
braces, garrulous silences, kisses, fears and trem- 
blings. In those moments the Croucher awoke 
to a sense of the bigness of things. He became 
enveloped in something ... a kind of . . 
. well the situation and, oh, everything. The 
murder, the siege, all London waiting for him, 
and that sort of thing. It gave him a new emo- 
tion; he felt proud and clean all through. He 
felt, in his own phrase, like as though he was 
going to find something he had been hunting for 
years and forgotten. One would like to know 
more, perhaps, for it might help us to live, and 
teach us something of pity . . ." 

There are other stories, some too terrible for 
thought, some cheaply startling, one, at least, 
lovely and lyrical. Yet if Mr. Burke had writ- 
ten only these stories justice could only say of 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



67 



him that he wrote stories which, in the eyes of 
English critics, were as good as the stories they 
imported from America. Our reputation for 
short-story telling is as marked here as our repu- 
tation for telling tall stories. Mr. Burke's au- 
thority comes not from the rediscovery of 
Chinatown; that lay waiting for his step. It 
comes from the rediscovery of London. 

"It is the Call not only of London, but of 
Beauty, of Life. Beauty calls in many voices; 
but to me and to six million others she calls in 
the voice of Cockaigne, and it shall go hard with 
any man who hears the Call and does not an- 
swer." So Mr. Burke pronounces Cockney. 
Because it is the call of beauty he can never be a 
slummer ; because it is the call of life he can never 
be a reformer. Here, in a book which traverses 
the fastnesses of conventionality in Bayswater, 
the open streets of hospitality, the commons of 
sudden friendship, and the mews and alleys of 
equally sudden violence, Mr. Burke discloses 
himself. He writes of his early life, the disasters 
of a Fleet Street apprenticeship, and one under- 
stands why he has no harsh words for the beastly 
and the low. He has too often partaken of their 
bread and salt. But his precious purity of vision 
lies in his abnormal ability to write with love 
and friendship of those whom our novelists are 
pointedly ignoring, or only dragging forward 
into shame and ridicule. I mean the real middle 
classes those whom Dante rejected and whom 
Dickens folded to his heart; those who make 
neither great affirmations nor heroic rejections, 
but live in placid gentleness, Philistine but not 
tyrannical, with the good heart and a mind kept 
in its proper place. He will take his fling at 
Kensington, "touched with the temper of last 
night's soda-water" because "there are no girls 
and no women; they are all young ladies." The 
gilded haunts of virtue cannot appeal to him. 
But he will go to Clapham, where mothers keep 
watchful eyes on daughters, and to a whist-drive 
at Surbiton and call these happy nights. 

The wanderings take him to the Scandinavian 
quarter and to the Ghetto, to the black Isle of 
Dogs with its workers, and to Hoxton where 
gangs of bashers were wont to play with the 
police. Round the halls or to the promenade 
concerts, into Soho with its restaurants from 
France and Italy. But wherever he is, the Cock- 
ney remains, rejoicing in his great domain. The 
Cockney for whom "Tipperary" was false in one 
thing: "Good-by Piccadilly, farewell Leicester 
Square." Little did the Cockney care about these 



show-places of London; he had his little shrine 
elsewhere, in Seven Sisters Road, in Marylebone, 
in Walthamstow cr Wormwood Scrubs, far be- 
yond the sound of the bells which make him a 
Cockney in all accuracy, but part of London none 
the less. Wilde wrote once of a great man's 
"shrill cockney cry of delight in discovering 
Italy," and rightly, because there were wonders 
more fair in London town. To these wonders 
the new Cockney comes, crying softly and in 
a likable voice. He has discovered that his home 
is a place of strange enchantments; he is always 
finding his way to Paradise by way of Clapham 
Green. 

The Cockney remains in Mr. Burke. Else 
he might have become a super-guidebook, in the 
manner of E. V. Lucas. The Cockney demands 
population; take Mr. Burke away from human 
beings and he is lost; he will write you all man- 
ner of lovely things about the luminous streets, 
but it will not last. His ear will hear an organ 
grinding out "Let's all go down the Strand" and 
you cannot keep him from beating time. Then 
he will go down the Strand and swear softly at 
the despoilers of its Sunday joys. 

He writes about everything that is human and 
he is satisfied with humanity as subject-matter. 
I am sure that he has been called a stark realist, 
but since realist has come to mean one who hates 
humanity enough to lie about it, the name will 
not pass. Mr. Burke is, I fear, out of class, be- 
cause the category for him was just being elab- 
orated when the war broke out. He would be 
with those who have passed through the gray 
days of pessimism and hatred and even through 
the soppy days of pity for everything human and 
divine. He would have been a cheerful compan- 
ion for the writers who are looking with clear 
eyes on the world they have discovered for them- 
selves and who know that the essence of romance 
is that all things are new. We saw the faint 
beginnings of this romance in such a book as 
"Carnival," and I fear we have seen its end. 
Our novelists may love the world after the 
war; but it is questionable whether the world 
will have time to return the affection for many 
years. Possibly Mr. Burke's books, at once vig- 
orous and wanton, may be respected afterward; 
one fears only that they will be found a little 
purposeless, a little lacking in social direction. 
It is that lack, of course, which makes them so 
attractive. For, it may be mentioned, these are 
wonderfully good things to read.

BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS 



THE RUHLEBEN PRISON CAMP. By Israel 

Cohen. Dodd, Mead ; $2.50. 

Mr. Cohen's book is a substantial and inter- 
esting contribution to the already vast literature 
of the present war. It is an absorbing story of 
life in a great concentration camp in which more 
than 4000 British civilians were interned by the 
German government soon after the outbreak of 
the war. The author is an English Jew, who was 
a newspaper correspondent in Germany at the 
beginning of the war. Arrested for no other rea- 
son than that he was an alien enemy, he was im- 
prisoned three different times in the city jail of 
Berlin and finally interned in the concentration 
camp for civilians at Ruhleben, where he was con- 
fined for nineteen months. 

His story is a recital of hardships, of brutality, 
and of despair almost without parallel in the his- 
tory of modern warfare. The prison camp was a 
race-course near Berlin, the stalls and lofts of 
which were converted into barracks into which the 
prisoners were huddled and jammed like animals. 
Without the most ordinary comforts, insufficiently 
fed and warmed, without adequate bathing facil- 
ities, without proper medical attendance, denied all 
newspapers except a cheap Berlin sheet, forbidden 
to see their wives and children for the first seven- 
teen months after the opening of the camp, limited 
in their postal privileges to the writing of one short 
letter each week, subjected to the most rigorous 
military discipline, severely punished for trifling in- 
fractions of the prison regulations, their physical 
suffering and mental torture was indescribable. 
The privilege of engaging in sports having been 
tardily wrung from the camp authorities upon pay- 
ment of 2400 marks per year for the use of the 
inner half of the race-course, the prisoners found 
a means of relieving in some measure the deadly 
monotony of their daily life. Societies of various 
kinds, literary, artistic, social, professional, and 
athletic, were formed; educational classes were or- 
ganized; concerts, plays, and lectures were staged 
and a variety of similar expedients adopted to dis- 
tract their minds from constant brooding. The 
whole story is told dispassionately and with a charm 
of manner and power of description that make the 
recital one of the most vivid and fascinating chap- 
ters yet written in the history of the great war. 

GERMANY IN DEFEAT. By Count Charles de 
Souza. Dutton ; $2. 

The author of these convenient volumes has 
succeeded in doing an admirable thing. A soldier 
himself, and interested in the larger strategic as- 
pects of the war, he has written a book which will 
be read with pleasure by the non-military man. 
He has performed a much-needed service to the 
general reader by bringing order out of the chaos 
left in most minds by the daily press. Though 
he deals with campaigns and victories, and the 
mistakes of commanders, he has a clear vision of 
the relative importance of events, and brings be- 
fore the reader the great stage of war in its true 
setting. 



Count de Souza is, however, a thorough parti- 
san, and his book will not be agreeable reading 
for adherents of Germany. As his title indi 
he believes that Germany has been fighting a losing 
cause since the Marne. He looks upon all her 
subsequent acts as those of a fighter who has been 
put upon the defensive. As in the earlier volumes, 
he pictures Marshal Joffre as the outstanding 
military figure of the war the true master <>i 
grand strategy. He makes clear to the reader that 
Germany was not set to capture Paris or War 
but to crush the French and Russian armies, neither 
of which results she was able to attain. He 
therefore minimizes the importance of the great 
Russian campaign of 1915, and argues that in the 
fundamental sense it was a failure for Germain, 
or at most a barren victory. He keeps forever 
in mind the essential fact that delay is fatal to 
the German cause, and that her whole strategic 
plan was based upon an early and overwhelming 
success. 

Count de Souza is a special pleader, but no 
follower of the Entente will fail to be thrilled by 
his argument. In closing the present volume with 
a description of the Battle of Verdun, he again sets 
in the foreground the great figure of the patient 
Joffre, strategic genius, conserver of his men, un- 
shakable believer in that nibbling policy by which, 
in the author's opinion, the downfall of the Ger- 
man military power is to be achieved. 

THE BRONTES AND THEIR CIRCLE. By 
Clement Shorter. Dutton; 50 cts. 

Mr. Shorter's large book is here brought out 
in the convenient "Wayfarer's Library." Though 
the size and print are smaller, nothing is omitted. 
In running through the book, the reader feels 
again how great is his debt to Mr. Shorter for 
these new Bronte letters letters which reveal so 
much of the three sisters, especially Charlotte. 
Aside from the letters, however, the book is not 
particularly valuable. Mr. Shorter does not suf- 
ficiently unify the story; nor are the conclusions he 
draws always trustworthy. For instance, he denies 
that Charlotte had any particularly warm feeling 
for M. Heger, whereas both the letters and the 
novels are direct witness that the author of Jane 
Eyre suffered from unrequited affection. It can 
hardly be denied that the tang of reality in her 
stories is attributable to her sufferings. On the 
other hand, it is presumptuous to assume that 
the love was a guilty one; it seems rather to have 
been the fixed idea of a strong feminine mind fas- 
cinated by a virile personality. The editor draws 
other conclusions that are not altogether justifi- 
able, but one is grateful for his patience in fer- 
reting out many contributions to the Bronte story. 

THE JOYOUS ART OF GARDENING. B\ 

Frances Duncan. Scribner; $1.75. 

"The Joyous Art of Gardening" is an alluring 
title. It sounds as if Miss Duncan had discovered 
some royal road to miracles of garden loveliness 
and gardener's skill in producing them. Further ex- 
amination discloses that most > ! >i:iu -.m's 
chapters are matter-of-fact expositions, intended

for beginners about to embark on "The Joyous 
Adventure of a First Garden." They treat such 
prosaic subjects as what and how to plant, how 
to prune shrubs, the possibilities of fences and 
lattices, how to make slips and cuttings, and so on. 
But as there is, after all, no royal road to suc- 
cessful gardening, and as "The Joyous Adventure 
of a First Garden," like other joyous adventures of 
a first baby, a first trip to Europe, and so on, 
is the most wonderful of all garden adventures, 
we consider Miss Duncan's title justified. One 
flaw we find in her book: all the particularly joy- 
ous pictures show pools, but in the text we find 
no mention of water in gardens, except as applied 
with a hose or a watering-pot. To offset this 
defect noticeable, perhaps, only to a gardener who 
happens to be struggling with the problem of a 
suitable pool it is only fair to call attention to 
the delightful first chapter, "In Praise of Garden- 
ing." "There be delights," Miss Duncan quotes 
from an ancient writer, "that will fetch the day 
about from sun to sun and rock the tedious year 
as in a delightful dream"; and she proceeds, with 
a contagious enthusiasm, to suggest some of the 
"1,000 delights of gardens" that the old-time gar- 
den-lover enumerated. Lately Dame Fashion set 
her devotees to planting sweet peas and roses ; 
now the war has switched the emphasis to beans 
and "spuds." But we must have the flowers too, 
and as the practical result of long and varied ex- 
perience, Miss Duncan's garden-guide will stimulate 
interest and furnish valuable information to the 
garden-adventurer whose high ideal is not size or 
showiness or expensiveness but that far more elu- 
sive garden-quality, charm. 

SHOULD STUDENTS STUDY? By William T. 
Foster. Harper; 50 cts. 

The felicitous title of this little book suggests a 
cleverness of style and a tone of mild irony, which 
run through the whole argument. The author is 
at odds with many tendencies of college life, and 
against certain obvious abuses he wields an effec- 
tive, if not a weighty, weapon. Many of his hits, 
too, are palpable ones, and will appeal to college 
boys themselves; and few of the conclusions can 
be successfully opposed. The thoughtful reader, 
however, after a diverting hour, will lay down the 
book with a feeling that all has not been said. 
Though it is true, as the author in many ways 
points out, that students ought to study, it is not 
so certain that they ought always to study what 
faculties prescribe; and this large field of argu- 
ment is but lightly touched in Mr. Foster's enter- 
taining volume. He gives many figures to prove 
that students of high scholarship supply the larg- 
est number of men distinguished in later life, and 
no one will be surprised at the statistics which show 
that, of the low scholarship men, few attain prom- 
inence in later years. 

One cannot help wondering, however, whether 
the college curriculum has made a successful 
search of the aptitudes of all the men who are 
tried by its tests. The business world, for in- 
stance, has not yet accepted the college. The 
prejudice of an older day against book-learning 



will not down, and it is by no means certain that 
the colleges have made more than a start in the 
reform which practical men have expected. It 
would be interesting to hear what so skilful a 
pleader as Mr. Foster might say on the subject 
of adapting colleges more closely than now to the 
manifold needs of the time. But it would be 
unfair to imply that this book is not a stimulat- 
ing one. It carries its points with force, and it 
is written in a style that is pungent, and at times 
brilliant. 

THE TOMB OF SENEBTISI AT LISHT. By 
Arthur C. Mace and Herbert E. Winlock. 
Metropolitan Museum of Art; paper, $8.; 
boards, $10. 

The first publication of the Egyptian expedition 
of the Metropolitan Museum is this handsome 
quarto volume by the assistant curators of the 
museum's department of Egyptian art. The work 
of the expedition was begun in the winter of 
1906-07 on the site of the pyramid-field of Lisht, 
which includes the pyramids of Amenemhat 1 and 
Senusert 1, of the Twelfth Dynasty, with "royal" 
cemeteries surrounding them. Up to 1915 the 
major part of the work had been upon the northern 
end of the site the pyramid of Amenemhat. The 
results of an important part of the work are 
given in the present volume. Text and drawings, 
photogravures and colored plates present and de- 
scribe the site and the tomb, the clearing of the 
tomb, the coffins and canopic box, the jewelry, 
ceremonial staves, and pottery. Appendixes con- 
tain notes on the mummy, by Dr. G. Elliott Smith, 
and an index of names of objects from the painted 
coffins. Mr. Albert Morton Lythgoe, curator of 
the department of Egyptian art, is general editor 
of the publications of the expedition. 

THE LIFE AND LETTERS OF CHRISTOPHER 

PEARSE CRANCH. By Leonora Cranch Scott. 

Houghton Mifflin; $3.50. 

The reader who is accustomed to think of Chris- 
topher P. Cranch as a Transcendental poet may 
be surprised to find how small a part either Trans- 
cendentalism or poetry occupies in this "Life and 
Letters." Trained for the Unitarian ministry and 
for some years a successful preacher, though never 
regularly settled, Cranch became in old age a sort 
of cheery agnostic. Transcendentalism marked 
one of the stages of thought through which he 
passed. He was all his life devoted to poetry, 
as he was to music; but after he abandoned the 
ministry, painting was his chief occupation. It was 
his love for this art that led him to spend much 
of his time abroad, and his success was recognized 
in London and Paris as well as in New York and 
Cambridge. His writings brought him some rep- 
utation and some money. Possibly the reason that 
they brought no more may be guessed from a letter 
which Story wrote him in 1856: "We all know 
that you can do much better if you choose to put 
your energies to work. . . Don't get lazy over 
it, and think it will do itself. Brace up your fac- 
ulties, and think you touch gold thereby. . . 
I pray you on my knees, oh ! Cranch, wake up to

this and do it well." This was apropos of a prose 
story to follow "The Last of the Huggermuggers," 
but it is significant that he never wrote a better 
stanza than the one beginning "Thought is deeper 
than all speech," published in the "Dial" about 
1840; and that he never fully got over the loose- 
ness that would let him rhyme "Jehovah" and 
"over" in his "Hymn to the Pilgrims" of the same 
date. Mrs. Scott tells us that her father's man- 
uscripts were submitted to George William Curtis, 
who "decided that further publication would add 
nothing to the fame of his friend." Strictly speak- 
ing, Curtis was probably right. With a few ex- 
ceptions the selections from Cranch's letters, jour- 
nals, and autobiography give no deep insight into 
the heart of the man, and many of them do not 
even tell the most significant facts of his life. His 
biographer has shown a daughter's partiality in 
including accounts of travels, which, while pleas- 
antly written, add little that is worth while. Cranch 
seems to have been a man whose character is 
best seen as reflected by his friends. By far the 
most valuable part of the book is made up of the 
letters he received from others. Besides early notes 
from James Freeman Clarke and Emerson, there 
are several letters in Lowell's happiest manner, 
several from the Brownings in one of which Mrs. 
Browning gives in detail both her own and her 
husband's criticisms of one of Cranch's poems 
and many from W. W. Story and George William 
Curtis. A few, like those of Curtis from Berlin, 
are valuable for themselves ; but most are of the 
sort that reveal the recipient as well as the author. 
The man who could inspire them had a rare nature, 
and their publication is a proper and a welcome 
filial tribute. 

JESUS, THE CHRIST, IN THE LIGHT OF PSY- 
CHOLOGY. By G. Stanley Hall. 2 Vols. 
Doubleday, Page; $7.50. 

The late Josiah Royce, writing about "what is 
vital in Christianity," succeeded in making out 
that what is vital in Christianity is Royceian trans- 
cendentalism. Mr. G. Stanley Hall makes out 
that what is vital in Christianity is the particular 
fashion in modern psychology that he most affects. 
But where Royce turned his trick in a few thou- 
sand words, Mr. Hall takes two ponderous vol- 
umes to turn his, with the display of erudition, 
neologisms, and liveliness long familiar to readers 
of this voluminous writer. 

Mr. Hall thinks that the world is in sad need 
of a renovated Christianity. At present this re- 
ligion is out of keeping with the spirit of the times. 
It has undergone the mutations of periods of the- 
ological, speculative, and historical-philological re- 
thinking, each mode transmuting it to its own 
form. To-day these modes are outgrown: the 
dominant interest of the times is the psychological, 
and the psychology is the psychology of Freud. 
That great investigator of the mind of man in 
severance and aggregation, has shown that reli- 
gion and art are largely symbols which "sublimate" 
and vicariously realize all sorts of underground 
wishes and impulses that the compulsion of ter- 
ranean living represses. The rethinking of 



tianity in these terms may save Christianity, which 
is to-day in a parlous state. Such a rethinking is 
a problem in the psychogenesis of belief. To take 
the gospels literally is infantile, as is a child's tak- 
ing Blue Beard literally. Experience teaches us 
that Jesus is a symbol, that Christianity is a s\m- 
bol. The meaning of the symbol changes with the 
time, the place, and the condition, but it always 
designates more or less adequately the innermost 
\vishes and hopes of men. At first symbol and 
meaning are regarded as identical: there is a 
"period of spiritualizing the material"; then they 
are regarded as distinct ; a constant reinterpretation 
becomes necessary; there ensues a period of ar- 
tistic "sensualizing of the intellectual and the spir- 
itual." "Even," hence, "if the historical existence 
of Jesus were disproven, we should have to post- 
ulate some such person at about this time, place 
and circumstance." For man craves a symbol for 
his "eternal nature," and for this Jesus must stand. 
His life story must integrate and dignify the strug- 
gle between what is good and what is evil in man. 
His character must be infinitely complex; indeed, 
all things to all men, the realization of all ideals, 
the artistic projection of the vital hopes and lies, 
we might add that severally animate us all and 
are our Bethlehemic stars. 

So Mr. Hall, learnedly and interestingly enough, 
contributing his share to the modern obscurantism 
that insists on having, in Christianity, the old 
shadow with a new substance. A candid psychol- 
ogist might be invited to say whether the deference 
to this shadow, to Jesus, to Christian myth- 
ology, and to all the rest, is not itself an infantil- 
ism, a survival from the thinker's wishes and fears 
and prepossessions of childhood. For, we may per- 
tinently ask, why should the new wine of psy- 
chology be poured into just these old bottles of 
Christianity? Is not the back yard of civilization 
littered with old bottles enough? And why, indeed, 
old bottles? Is there anything in the Freudian 
mechanisms to compel the use of old ones? 

In sum, Dr. Hall's psychological treatment of 
Jesus and Christianity reminds the reviewer of the 
famous summing up of the gospel of the late 
Modernist movement in the Catholic church: 
"there is no God and Mary is his mother." 

THE BEGINNINGS OF PORCELAIN IN CHINA. 
By Berthold Laufer. Field Museum of Nat- 
ural History. 

Dr. Laufer, the curator of anthropology at the 
Field Museum, occupies a unique place among 
American scholars. From a sinologue saturated 
with the ethnological point of view, he has devel- 
oped into an ethnologist who has indeed chosen 
China for his special sphere of inquiry hut never 
ceases to regard Chinese civilization in its relations 
to that of surrounding nations and of mankind as 
a whole. Hardly any of his monographs, however 
specialized a treatment may be suggested In its 
title, can be ignored by the student of culture, 
and his latest volume is a veritable treasure-trove 
for the ethnologist, the Orientalist, and the anti- 
quarian. The notion of glazing pottery was de- 
rived by the Chinese from the West through their

relatively late contact with the Greek culture-area 
during the reign of the Han dynasty, and espec- 
ially that of the Emperor Wu (140-87 B. C). 
Original experiments with glazing were under- 
taken, and about the middle or close of the third 
century of our era a type of ceramic ware had 
arisen which agrees absolutely with the later por- 
celain in chemical composition but differs in appear- 
ance owing to its porosity, which is probably 
caused by the use of too coarsely ground material. 
At last genuine porcelain resulted about the be- 
ginning of the seventh century as the end product 
of a long-continued series of experiments and im- 
provements. It cannot therefore be attributed to 
a single inventor but is due to the united efforts of 
generations; and we have here a striking instance 
of how an alien idea may not only be assimilated 
but even come to stimulate creative activity. 

Dr. Laufer is wont to interlard his monographs 
with supererogatory side remarks as illuminating 
as the main discussion, and here he appends a whole 
chapter on "The Potter's Wheel." His point is 
that hand-made and wheel-turned pottery belong 
to entirely distinct cultural domains. The latter 
cannot be regarded as the natural, let alone neces- 
sary, evolutionary derivative of the former. Hand- 
made ware is practically always manufactured by 
women; wheel-turned pottery is always made by 
men. Man applied the wheel, a device originally 
connected with the cart or chariot, to the ceramic 
problem; the origin of the potter's wheel is clearly 
revealed by East Indian specimens, where the 
spokes are still preserved. It belongs to the com- 
plex of ideas which ancient China shared with 
other Asiatic civilizations of hoary antiquity, 
with the plough and the ox as representatives of 
masculine husbandry as opposed to feminine till- 
age with the aid of the hoe. The potter's wheel 
is thus not merely of ethnographical significance 
but is also bound up with one of the most persistent 
forms of a sexual division of labor. Dr. Laufer's 
paper is thus doubly suggestive in shedding light 
on the psychology of technological progress and in 
establishing an important sociological correlation. 

TEXAS THE MARVELLOUS. By Nevin O. 
Winter. Page Co.; $3.50. 

To the "See America First" series Mr. Nevin 
O. Winter adds a spacious volume on the wonders 
and beauties, the riches and large possibilities, of 
the Lone Star State. The history of this common- 
wealth has been made so familiar in connection 
with the Mexican War that no additional general 
chronicle of its checkered course was needed; hence 
the earlier and historical chapters of the book are 
less notable and less distinctive than the later pages 
depicting the present condition of Texas, its in- 
dustries and resources, its spirit of progress (espec- 
ially noteworthy is the account of "Pioneering in 
Government Affairs"), and some of the marked 
characteristics of its far from commonplace popula- 
tion. Special studies of "the Hero of San Jacinto," 
"Historic San Antonio," the old Spanish missions, 
life in the early days, ranches and ranching, and 
other Texan topics, are features of the volume. 
It is the enthusiasm animating the descriptive mat- 



ter that most attracts the reader and holds his 
attention. The publishers have given to the text 
a setting little short of magnificent, large type, 
fifty-four illustrations (six in color), a folding map, 
and an ornate binding. 

PRINCIPLES OF MONEY AND BANKING. By 

Harold G. Moulton. University of Chicago 

Press; $3. 

The publication of Professor Moulton's book 
affords what is probably the most complete text- 
book in this field of economics. The volume consists 
of "a series of selected materials with explan- 
atory introductions"; but, as the editor is careful 
to explain, it is not a book of collateral readings 
in the ordinary sense, for it is designed "to give 
the student a breadth of view, a contact with 
reality, a stimulus to independent thinking, and 
a training in judgment and discrimination which 
are not afforded by the ordinary text-book." The 
purpose of a course in money and banking is not 
to furnish the student with predigested informa- 
tion or to compel him to memorize principles; 
what is desired is thought and discussion on his 
part, and the way to secure this desired result, 
Professor Moulton argues, is to supply the student 
not only with the conclusions of economic theorists, 
but also with the material necessary for the formu- 
lation by the student (perhaps under the guidance 
of an instructor) of his own conclusions and prin- 
ciples. For this purpose the volume is admirably 
adapted. The catholicity of selections is shown 
to cite only one instance by the fact that A. 
Barton Hepburn is quoted between two excerpts 
from William Jennings Bryan. Continental and 
Anglo-American writers, practical bankers, and 
economists are represented. The volume deserves 
a wider circulation than that of the classroom. 

PRINCIPLES OF AMERICAN STATE ADMINISTRA- 
TION. By John Mabry Mathews. Appleton; 
$2.50. 

Following the Civil War and the death of state 
sovereignty, there was a relative decline of inter- 
est in state government. The national government 
overshadowed everything, both for the politicians 
and the students. In recent years the state has 
been coming into its own again. It is finding 
itself, not as a rival of the national government, 
but rather as an enlarged municipality. For this 
field the state is more necessary than ever and its 
work is constantly increasing. Scholars now recog- 
nize this fact and are devoting serious study to 
the problems of state government. One of the 
latest and most important additions to this field 
is Professor Mathews's work. The author follows 
the modern trend in dealing with civic questions in 
that he lays more emphasis on functions than on 
forms. About two-fifths of the book is devoted to 
the organization of the administration, the rest 
to the functions which it performs. The hybrid 
character of our state executive is well brought 
out in the chapters on the governor and his powers, 
the heads of executive departments, and the 
boards and commissions. Naturally, the conclu- 
sion reached is that it would be better to have a

somewhat like our national cabinet. Another con- 
clusion is that the separation of powers has been 
carried to an absurd extreme. The book is written 
in clear, non-technical language and should be of 
use, not only to students of state government, but 
also to delegates who this year and next will be 
engaged in drawing up new constitutions. 

A SECOND BOOK OF OPERAS. By Henry Ed- 
ward Krehbiel. Maonillan; $2. 
As its title indicates, this is a supplement to the 
author's earlier work of the same nature. It "con- 
siders the plots, the music, and the histories of 
those important operas which were not included in 
his first work," and the two together are supposed 
to embrace "practically all the operas that are ever 
presented in the modern theatre." Biblical operas 
and oratorios and recent Italian, German, and 
French productions furnish topics for the bulk of 
the book, which is of the same useful, easily con- 
sulted sort as its predecessor. A plea is made for 
the further utilization of biblical themes in opera, 
and the biblical operas of Rubinstein, whom the 
author confesses to have been "the strongest per- 
sonal influence in music" he has ever felt, receive 
considerable attention. In Italian opera "Pagliacci" 
and "Cavalleria" are by this time comparatively 
old acquaintances, as is also "Madama Butterfly"; 
but it is handy to have these with other and less 
familiar pieces all treated in Mr. Krehbiel's in- 
structive and entertaining manner. As in his earlier 
work, the free expression of his own preferences 
and aversions contributes to the enjoyment of the 
book. Portraits of composers and performers 
abound, and there are a few facsimiles of auto- 
graph scores. 

EGYPTIAN RECORDS OF TRAVEL IN WESTERN 

ASIA. Edited by David Paton. Vol. II. 

Princeton University Press; $7.50. 

The period of Egypt's greatest prestige abroad, 
the XVIII Dynasty (1580-1350 B. C), is made to 
speak for itself in the second volume of "Egyptian 
Records of Travel in Western Asia." The aged 
grandee Amenemheb may be heard telling how he 
"cut off the hand (trunk?)" of a huge elephant 
when danger threatened his lord Thutmote III in 
the Euphrates country. Or one may read in a 
slightly later folk-tale how Thuti, a general of the 
same king, captured Joppa by an Ali Baba trick. 
Thutmose's own extensive Annals of his Asiatic 
campaigns are to form volume III. The introduc- 
tion of page numbers supplies an awkward 
deficiency of the first volume, especially when con- 
sidered as a reference work. For this function the 
series is richly equipped with a thorough bibliog- 
raphy. But the sign-by-sign collations are useless 
without Erman's "Aegyptische Grammatik," which 
none but the specialist would possess; and the 
author's previous disavowal of any claims to inde- 
pendent authority prepares one for various misun- 
derstandings in the transliteration and translation 
of the texts. The absence of explanatory notes on 
the geographical terms assembled in the final col- 
umn is unfortunate, for the reader may not suspect 
the identity of "Ngbba," for example, with the 



Negcb (Southern Palestine) or of "Haarah\\ -land " 
with the city of Aleppo. In any ca>e. both Mr. 
Paton and his typist Mr. Welter are to be com- 
plimented for their devotion to an arduous task. 

THE RETURN TO FAITH. By William North 

Rice. Abingdon; 75 cts. 

This slim little book, five addresses in all, taking 
title from the first, contains the very cream of the 
whole matter the apparent disparateness of science 
and religion, still of vital import despite the pre- 
occupations of the day. The return to faith is 
not presented here as due to any remarkable ver- 
ifications in newly found records, of old traditions, 
nor to geological evidence that the biblical order 
of creation, interpreting a "day" as this or that 
number of thousands of years, is now found scien- 
tific, nor to any similar finding of pseudo-scientific 
abracadabra. The return to faith is due to a be- 
lief in the man Jesus. Theism has not conquered 
monism. In the second address the author sa\s. 
"We believe in God to-day because we believe in 
Jesus Christ." It might do Dr. Rice's thought in- 
justice to take this out of its context and follow 
it through all its negative implications; but cer- 
tainly it shows the method of scientific induction 
beautifully contrasted with the Aristotelian cus- 
tom of starting with an assumed universal affirma- 
tive. In assigning to Jesus this demonstrative 
importance Dr. Rice is not unique by any means; 
he merely represents the higher religious convic- 
tions of most liberal Christians. But his book is 
remarkable for the unconditional and intelligent 
acceptance of science with all its implications. 
There is no string either to his science or to his 
religion. 

SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT. By George R. Davies. 

McClurg; 50 cts. 

The long and not wholly academic discussion 
of the relative merits of heredity and environment 
as formative factors finds a new presentation in 
this brief volume. It is interesting to note that 
popular thinking generally accepts the biological 
view of character formation, but our author takes 
the more recent and sophisticated view that char- 
acter, in its social aspects at least, is mainly the 
result of environmental influences. While giving due 
weight to hereditary factors, especially in relation 
to our purely physical traits, he devotes his space 
mainly to illustrating the influence of the various 
environmental formative factors in building up 
acquired characters through the learning process. 
Mental and moral characters, apparently, always 
have a large element of learned adjustments in 
them, even though they are built upon native or 
instinctive reactions as bases. The forces which 
make great men and great peoples are quite as 
much environmental or social as they are hereditary 
or biological. The science of eugenics (and eu- 
thenics) must come to depend more and more upon 
the sciences of environment, even though the laws 
of heredity cannot be disregarded or neglected. 
Hitherto there has been a dearth of literature em- 
phasizing environmental forces in society. This 
little book should be welcome for its contribu- 
tion to that neglected field.

ON 



FICTIOX 



If you were an internationally notorious gambler 
and an assiduous district attorney shut up your 
"place" and practically exiled you from New York, 
what would you do? Let it be understood that 
the press has snapped you until an alibi is im- 
possible, save temporarily in the remotest quarters 
of the earth. Let it be further understood that 
you are a gentleman, self-made, to be sure, but 
absolutely "on the square," with better manners 
than the district attorney, a nicer taste in first 
editions than the eminent New York lawyer who 
has long received generous payment for protecting 
your business, and a higher sense of honor than 
most of your wealthy and respectable ex-patrons. 
Granted further that you are middle-aged and a 
bibliophile, but a sociable and active one, with no 
intimate friends out of New York save the one 
faithful, enigmatical valet who insists on being in- 
cluded in the adventures of your "retirement"; 
and, finally, let it be fully understood that your 
private character has been so subordinated to your 
public career that no respectable citizen, however 
fair-minded, wishes to associate with you. 

These are the novel and amusing problems that 
Mr. Gordon Hall Gerould sets himself to solve 
in "Peter Sanders, Retired" (Scribner's; $1.50), 
a tale that is gay without vapidity and adventurous 
without sensationalism. Thoroughly to enjoy it, 
one should know that Mr. Gerould is a college 
professor; his interest in ex-gamblers gains pi- 
quancy from this fact. His stories some of the 
episodes of Peter Sanders's career have come out 
in the magazines are apparently the fruits of his 
leisure hours. Unlike the tired business man, who 
will consider "Peter Sanders" too analytical for his 
taste, Professor Gerould finds thinking a delight, 
even at the end of a jaded day; planning the re- 
tirement of Peter Sanders has evidently been a 
truly recreative adventure. The book is as gay 
and sparkling as a trout-stream, as piquant as a 
spring salad, with the "snap" of a well-driven 
golf-ball, and the zest that goes with the energy 
one puts into good play or good work. We have 
said that the tired business man may find it be- 
yond him, but let that not be interpreted to mean 
that the book suffers from a surplus of academic 
atmosphere. Mr. Gerould may be academic at 
times, but not when he is having fun with Peter 
Sanders, ex-gambler. 

The sublime and the ridiculous, the depressing 
and the appealing, when mingled together and 
treated with a strong dash of humor, form a sub- 
stance difficult of analysis. So it is in "April 
Folly," by St. John Lucas (Button; $1.50). The 
novel is one of those second-rate English works, 
which, had it come from an American pen, would 
have been hailed as a masterpiece. It is, in fact, 
an extremely interesting piece of fiction a first- 
rate analysis of calf love in London Bohemia. The 
only difficulty lies in the comparative slimness of 
the subject; it does not draw out the novelist's re- 
sources. What really interests us in the book, and 
what the author finally abandons for matters that 
he apparently considers more important, is the 



character of Rosalind, who guarded and guided the 
quartet of Chelsea musicians in their progress. 
The whole group is well sketched and we should 
have preferred following their adventures rather 
than turning to the sordid, pathetic little tragedy 
to which the story finally devotes its course. 

"Bab, A Sub-Deb," by Mary Roberts Rinehart 
(Doran; $1.40), is the story of a girl of seventeen 
who has successive affairs of the heart with a 
matinee idol, a married playwright, a youth of her 
own age, and even with an imaginary hero. This 
is padded, of course, with the usual Rinehart brand 
of comedy, a brand which is as amusing in its way 
as the after-dinner talk of a care-free group of 
high-school girls. 

The things that pleased us in "The Dark Tow- 
er" were its economy of utterance and its sim- 
ple relation of a story whose characters made its 
telling worth while. In the collection entitled, 
"The Derelict" (Century; $1.35), the only story 
that is really worth the reader's attention judged 
by Phyllis Bottome's own standard of work is the 
title piece. This is a "strong" tale of the moral 
victory over a good English woman of a woman 
whom the world termed anything but good. Its 
telling, however, is somewhat marred by an af- 
fected epigrammatism. There is nothing profound 
about "The Derelict," but it serves. Less can be 
said for the other stories; the reader's enjoyment 
of them will probably be proportionate to his tol- 
eration of average magazine fiction. 

In "The Cinema Murder" (Little, Brown; 
$1.35) E. Phillips Oppenheim leaves world politics 
and intrigue for a time and devotes himself to a 
mystery story. Curiously enough, both his story 
and "The Man in Evening Clothes," by John Reed 
Scott (Putnam's; $1.50), suggest that it does not 
pay to be too good in this world. The outcome of 
the stories justifies the heroes in their departure 
from rectitude. In Mr. Oppenheim's book a 
starving playwright commits murder, or intends to, 
and robs his victim, and from that time dates the 
material success of his life. In Mr. Scott's book 
the hero is one of those gentlemen-thieves who 
rob their friends and acquaintances, but finally re- 
form and win the lady's heart. The plot varies 
from type in that our thief is puzzled by the opera- 
tions of another member of his profession. Both 
stories are told with the proper amount of sus- 
pense and the proper number of surprises. 

That "Dawson ain't no place fer a woman," we 
agreed heartily with Tim Meadows after a peru- 
sal of "Kleath," by Madge Macbeth (Small, May- 
nard; $1.35). How realistically the author writes 
of the Klondike during the gold rush, we have no 
means of determining. Her tale is mingled of 
humor, pathos, and sensationalism, with an unbe- 
coming leaning toward dare-deviltry. It carries 
a certain air of conviction and will serve for read- 
ers whose imaginations accept the printed page as 
probable truth. 

"Enchantment," by E. Temple Thurston (Apple- 
ton; $1.50), though likewise melodramatic from 
cover to cover, is immeasurably better because of 
its charming style and interesting characterizations. 
Here the persons really have life and individuality

and do not merely perform such actions as the 
author wishes. The scene is laid in Ireland. The 
plot shows us a man bargaining with a priest, prom- 
ising to send his daughter to a nunnery if he breaks 
his pledge not to drink. The hero is the romantic 
son of a smuggler, and when the oath is broken, 
he asserts himself and steals the daughter away 
from the nuns. It is a tale for all those who 
"would not give a chapter of old Dumas for the 
whole boiling of the Zolas." 

The village type of story appears to be coming 
into vogue, together with a recrudescence of fiction 
of a historical turn. "Dominie Dean," by Ellis 
Parker Butler (Revell; $1.35), is quite up to date 
in these particulars, relating as it does the life of 
a young preacher in a Mississippi town during the 
Civil War. There is more than a touch of Mark 
Twain in its composition, without the spark that 
vitalizes Twain's narrative. 

"Pamela," warmed up in the French fashion and 
boiled down to one-fourth of its traditional length 
such is the formula applied in "Bindweed," by 
Gabrielle Vallings (Dodd, Mead; $1.50). Possess- 
ing all the conventional characters the villain- 
hero, the ingenue, the other charmer, and the noble 
friend the plot of this novel is probably aided 
in modern effectiveness by its setting in the operatic 
world of Paris. The book promises no great dis- 
traction for those readers who care to have their 
authors look upon life neither through a rose- nor 
a yellow-tinted medium. 

The original "Odd Number," a collection of 
thirteen tales with introduction by Henry James, 
gave many American and English readers their 
first introduction to Maupassant, and has long been 
one of the most familiar collections of short stories. 
"The Second Odd Number," with introduction by 
Mr. William Dean Howells, is bound to arouse 
considerable expectations and to cause some disap- 
pointment. The similarity in name and in outward 
form invite comparison with the earlier collection, 
and it is hardly to be expected that even so prolific 
an artist as Maupassant could produce twenty-six 
tales all of which are as good as his best thirteen. 
Three or four of those now given "The Jewels," 
"Grave-Walkers," "Passion," perhaps "Decorated" 
may have been excluded from the earlier list 
because of the greater reluctance to deal frankly 
with sex matters, but most of them were probably 
omitted for other reasons as well. "Tfc Jewels," 
it is true, presents a situation as striking and as 
tragic as that of "The Necklace," and offers even 
more opportunity for psychological analysis; but it 
is far below the author's best in finish and perfec- 
tion of form. "Grave-Walkers" is more artistic- 
ally wrought, and the taint of unpleasantness in 
the subject is saved from offensiveness by the bit 
of psychological observation at the end. "Tony," 
which for some reason is given the place of honor, 
abounds in sheer physical realism, and is too much 
for Mr. Howells, whom it moves to say of Mau- 
passant's occasional "brutality" that "its grossness 
bedaubs the author and comes off on the reader, 
without verifying the fact presented." Perhaps the 
tale that in proportion and restraint comes nearest 
to "The Necklace." "The Coward," and "A Piece 



of String" is "Two Friends" already probably 
known to most casual readers of Maupassant. But 
the new volume is worth having, though it can 
never cause quite the same thrill as its earlier 
namesake. (Harper; $1.25.) 

"Where Runs the River?" by Henrietta Leslie 
(Dutton; $1.50), parallels the episodes, particu- 
larly the love episodes, of a girl's life with a river 
in its different parts: the rill, the river proper, 
the marsh, the sea. When the story opens the girl 
is leading a simple life among the mountains, but 
as the successive episodes invariably end sadly, life 
itself constantly compels her to seek activity in 
new fields, and she finally takes up social work 
in London. The girl's character is developed not 
only by the various environments but also by the 
different men with whom she falls in love: the 
dilettante who plays with her; the unconsciously 
selfish man who uses her; the consciously selfish one 
who marries her and with whom she stagnates 
mentally; and, finally, the man who both gives and 
takes unselfishly and with whom she reaches the 
consummation of her life. All these characters 
are clearly and most interestingly differentiated. 
The whole story, in short, is a most charming 
idyll. 

"When the Sun Stood Still," by Cyrus Town- 
send Brady (Revell; $1.35), retells the biblical 
story of Joshua and his taking of the city of 
Jericho and his later conquest of the Canaanites. 
The chief figures in the tale are a young man 
in Joshua's camp, a woman among the Canaanites 
who is ready to accept Jehovah as her God, and 
Joshua himself. The love story, the narrow escapes 
of the lovers, and the military exploits of Joshua 
are given fine dramatic telling. Mr. Brady is in 
possession of just the style suitable for the relation 
of such a novel. 

McAllister's Grove," by Marion Hill (Apple- 
ton; $1.40), is to be recommended to those who 
want a pleasant story concerning pleasant people. 
To be sure, there is nothing new in the plot, which 
concerns the fortunes of a young woman who 
yields to the enthusiastic optimism of a Florida 
land agent, only to find herself mistress of a run- 
down orange grove. Finding a likable heroine in 
such a predicament, the reader knows that she 
will make an uphill fight which will end success- 
fully, if not romantically. Nor will the reader 
be disappointed; rather will he find an unusually 
well-written story which does not put too hc.u \ 
a strain upon his credulity and which has a vivid 
charm by way of local color and much genuine 
humor. 

If, with the rising temperature, one is willing 
to abandon consideration of probability nnd im- 
probability and to accept the premises of summer 
reading uncritically, much enjoyment may be found 
in following the adventures of a noble gentleman 
in the guise of a burglar playing hide-and-seek with 
Life in the cool green world of his country estate. 
Such is the fantastic fancy which Francis Perry 
Elliott is pleased to evolve in "Lend Me Your 
Name!" (Reilly & Britton; $1.25.) The au- 
thor has a knack of characterization and a \er\ 
pleasant feeling for summer romance in the open.

CASUAL, COMMENT 



WILLIAM WINTER was quite the most pro- 
lific and tireless of our dramatic critics. He began 
with a fine zeal, and he had the rare luck, as men 
go, of finding that zeal sufficient to last out a life- 
time. He had a great many admirable qualities, 
chief among which was an inflexible honesty. A 
man of downright personality and strongly 
marked style, he attracted followers in many 
parts of the country, and that tendency to 
gather adherents and inspire imitators had both 
its good and its bad effect on the contemporary 
American stage. The men who felt his influence 
were encouraged to indulge a literary feeling for 
words, old-fashioned to be sure, but still literary. 
To that extent he improved the technical qual- 
ity of critical journalism. Unfortunately, his 
shortcomings quite matched his virtues. He was 
the kind of man who finds youthful loyalties 
sufficient and undergoes no evolution. Essen- 
tially a hero-worshipper, he found it easier to 
worship men at a certain distance; hence his 
absurd devotion to the past, his intolerance of 
the experiments without which no art can live at 
all. His eyes were in the back of his head. In 
style and sentiment he was already outmoded in 
middle life, and he showed only impatience in 
the presence of those characteristic modern plays 
that exact some genuine cerebral response. As a 
result of his limitations, he failed to speak justly 
or intelligently of the most vital work of his 
time, and for such failure in the critic no amount 
of industry and no zeal in recalling the splendors 
of the past can compensate. 

A NEW GROUND FOR ADMITTING AMERICAN 
COOPERATION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE 

ENGLISH LANGUAGE has been discovered by the 
London "Times." The point of departure is, 
characteristically enough, that important organ- 
ism the British Empire. A loyal Boer has re- 
marked that the man who really found a proper 
name for this great conglomerate would be per- 
forming a valuable service for its many millions ; 
and the "Times" feels that a stronger effort 
would be required to substitute Commonwealth 
for Empire than to reorganize the Empire's gov- 
ernment. The difficulty with British nomencla- 
ture, just now, appears to be that the hand of 
classical language shall we say, the hand of 
classical philology? lies heavy on political sci- 
ence. Complaint is made of the juvenile habit 
of trying to turn English thought into Greek and 
Latin prose and to describe English institutions 
in incongruous classical terms. "Some of our 
pedagogues even cudgel their own and their 
pupils' brains to think what words an ancient 
Greek would have used to describe a 'U-boat' 
or a 'tank.' " While such an "obsession" lasts, 



"we shall have to look to America for the growth 
of the English language": to an America en- 
cumbered, by implication, with small Latin and 
less Greek. A new spirit here, however ex- 
pressed: one that America should meet not with 
slang, nor flippancy, nor breezy "language-sling- 
ing," but as an earnest of the future cooperation, 
in many directions, which is to subsist between 
the two countries for many years to come. 

THE PERIPATETIC MAGAZINE is over our land. 
"Off again, on again" is its motto. The "Little 
Review," once of Chicago, has reached New 
York by way of San Francisco. "Others," lately 
of New York (or its vicinage), may be trying 
to reach San Francisco, or some other town, by 
way of Chicago. At least Alfred Kreymborg, 
its- originator, is reported as at Los Angeles. But 
he looked over the local field a few months ago, 
and now "Others" hazards a "Chicago Num- 
ber," and announces that other numbers will 
come forth from the present headquarters on 
South Water Street. The first issue here Vol. 
4, No. 1 , as regards the whole series opens with 
the obligatory poem on the Soul of Chicago, a 
production full of the now requisite violence 
and swagger; and the number concludes with a 
poem by Mr. Kreymborg himself, on a theme 
cleverly seized through the open window of the 
new sanctum. Clark Street bridge and the hen- 
coops of South Water Street thus take their 
place at the hither end of tradition, and help 
establish a convention for the generations that 
follow. 



THEORY'S SEDUCTIVE CHARM makes fools of 
us all, though not of all at any one time, nor 
of anyone all the time. The beauty of a theory, 
until marred by the rude shock of a practical 
test, is to most of us well-nigh irresistibly lovely. 
Huxley used to maintain, with a chuckle of 
amusement, that Spencer's conception of a ca- 
tastrophe was the disconcerting discovery of one 
or more instances tending to upset a plausible 
and attractive theory. Of theory harshly con- 
tradicted by fact the history that is now in the 
making is unusually full; and it is not the occu- 
pants of professorial chairs at Heidelberg or 
Gottingen or elsewhere in middle-Europe that 
have been the only ones to spin theories out of 
moonshine. Even so clear a head as Mr. H. G. 
Wells's has not kept itself wholly free from 
the fogs of fallacious reasoning. His latest war 
book returns once more to the plausible general- 
ization that the Germans, as a whole, lack in- 
itiative, and therefore, it is argued, they find 
more congenial to their nature and suited to their 
training the Zeppelin, with its capability of 
executing large designs through the instrumental-

ity of a considerable company obeying one leader, 
than the aeroplane, which is the machine preem- 
inently fitted for the exercise of individual in- 
itiative. In other words, according to Mr. 
Wells, the German was conscious from the be- 
ginning that "he could not produce aviators to 
meet the Western Europeans; all his social in- 
stincts made him cling to the idea of a great, 
motherly, and almost sow-like bag of wind above 
him." Nevertheless two of the three most skil- 
ful and daring flyers thus far produced by the 
war were "made in Germany"; Boelcke, the 
chief of them all, was most unmistakably a Ger- 
man. . . . 

THE WORK OF EDGAR LEE MASTERS con- 
tinues to be abundantly noticed by the British 
press. Critics over there are still trying to place 
him, to put him into the right pigeonhole, to 
"find a name for him." The London "Times," 
for example, insists that he is not a prose writer 
and still less a poet. After going through the 
two hundred and eighty pages of "The Great 
Valley," the reviewer decides to call him a 
talker "a person who utters his ideas in talk 
without stopping very long to think what he is 
saying, ... a primitive and provincial 
Robert Browning." In the "Times" critic we 
evidently have a conservative one who does not 
relish the "colloquial style" that characterizes so 
much of free verse and does not believe that a 
man filled full of matter may quite trust that 
matter to run itself out. Yet there are advan- 
tages in speaking as one feels and in confidently 
letting words "unpack the heart" with a free 
runway. The improwisatore has many points in 
his favor. Abundance, fluency, momentum all 
these count to the good. Carry the contention 
too far the other way, and you begin to blame 
a Sorolla for not being a Meissonier, a Mas- 
cagni for not being a Humperdinck. Each man's 
expression according to his gifts. There will be 
debits as well as credits, but the balance in the 
end is likely to be on the right side. 

NEW GLIMPSES OF THREE GREAT POETS arc 

given in the "Cornhill." The poignant query, 
"Ah, did you once see Shelley plain, And did he 
stop and speak to you?" must, if put to Coler- 
idge, be answered in the negative, for reasons 
given below; but if "Keats" be substituted for 
"Shelley" the answer becomes a picturesque 
affirmative. Fresh light on the relations between 
the three is yielded by a new "Talk with Coler- 
idge," set down by John Frere in 1830 and but 
now transferred from manuscript to type. What 
most British critics thought of the two young 
poets in the '20's of the last century is but too 
well and fatally known. What was the attitude 
of Coleridge, a sort of literary arbiter of the 



day? His belated comment is by no means lack- 
ing in appreciation of either though it is the 
indulgent, rather casual comment of one who \\ a> 
established, upon a brace of younger men who 
were yet to become so. The meeting with Keats 
\\ as an unexpected, unconventional one in the 
public highway, and Coleridge did not learn 
until afterward the identity of the young man 
who had accosted him, though he felt the 
prophecy of death in Keats's handclasp two UMI> 
before the event. "I have seen two sonnets of 
his," said Coleridge to Frere, "which I think 
showed marks of a great genius had he lived. I 
have also read a poem with a classical name I 
forget what" : thus negligently do the Established 
take the efforts of the Beginner. As for Shelley, 
he got on Coleridge's track, but missed him. "He 
went to Keswick on purpose to see me," says the 
great Samuel, "and unfortunately fell in with 
Southey instead. There could have been nothing 
more unfortunate. . . I should have laughed 
at his atheism. . . I could have shown him 
that I had once been in the same state myself and 
I could have guided him through it." Coleridge 
appears to have thought that Shelley needed 
equal guidance through his poetry. He "was a 
man of great power as a poet, and could he only 
have had some notion of order, could you only 
have given him some plane whereon to stand and 
look down upon his own mind, he would have 
succeeded. There are flashes of the true spirit to 
be met with in his works." On the whole, it 
may be said that Coleridge safeguarded himself 
adequately with posterity, in reference to his two 
younger contemporaries, though his dicta might 
have been, speaking in modern terms, "differently 
expressed." ... 

THE PORTRAYAL OF HIGH SOCIETY IN FIC- 
TION is becoming a more exacting problem, and 
that exceptional publication, "Vogue," gives the 
matter its attention. "There is usually something 
a trifle nauseating," it says, "in the attempt to 
display the upper circles of Philadelphia, Boston 
and Chicago." That is the pronouncement, and 
no word of explanation follows. We are not 
told why there is something nauseating in the de- 
piction of the upper circles of Philadelphia, Bos- 
ton, and Chicago, nor why it should be more 
discomforting than an attempt to depict the upper 
circles of New York, a town which seems specifi- 
cally exempted. One can but grope. Is it be- 
cause the three cities designated have really no 
upper circles? Or is it because they possess no 
authors capable of depicting them? Or is it 
because the procedure of their authors is only a 
poor imitation, in manner and spirit, of the au- 
thors who treat New York? Or, finally, is it 
because New York is the one American cit\ 
which has any upper circles to render the "dis-

play" worth while? Probably this latter is the 
meaning intended. But if any of these provincial 
authors can produce a greater degree of nausea 
than several New York ones who are writing 
in a New York way on New York material, 
the country at large, along with "Vogue," would 
do well indeed to discountenance them. Why, 
one has but to name But one can also refrain 
from naming. Better still, one can drop the 
whole matter; for in these days of grim realities 
the display of upper circles, whether attempted 
or realized, may very well be dispensed with. 



GLIMPSES OF WARFARE IN THE ALPS are 
given by Mr. E. V. Lucas, who writes about 
anything and everything, and whose latest vol- 
ume deals with Red Cross work among the 
mountains of Italy's northeastern borders. Mr. 
Lucas used as an excursion-centre the small pro- 
vincial capital, Udine, close to the present or 
shall one say, the former Italo-Austrian fron- 
tier. Among prominent Englishmen engaged in 
work at this "outpost of mercy" to fall back on 
the book's title are George Trevelyan, the his- 
torian of Garibaldi, who is at the head of a staff 
of motor-ambulance drivers, and Dr. Ashby, di- 
rector of the British School of Archaeology, now 
a controller of hospital stores and bedding. As 
much too little is known about the campaignings 
of the Italian armies in the Alps, by reason of 
the singular indifference of the governmental au- 
thorities to a "good press," Mr. Lucas's account 
of "the spectacle of the Italian soldiers perform- 
ing astonishing tasks and cheerfully overcoming 
the most appalling difficulties" should be wel- 
come. . . . 

SOME CRITICISM HAS BEEN MADE OF THE 
EDITORIAL POLICY which has inspired THE DIAL 
to publish recently occasional articles of social 
rather than literary character. In explanation 
the Publisher wishes to state his conviction that 
a war for democracy is fought as much at home 
as on the firing line. Should the end of the pres- 
ent war see a return to former social conditions, 
the war will have been a ghastly crime. Unless 
those at home begin now the creative work of 
clear thinking upon the principles involved, they 
will betray the men who are risking their lives 
"in a war for democracy." It is imperative that 
we begin now preparing those social changes 
which will be the foundations of a permanent 
peace. Those changes cannot be made overnight, 
nor can their consideration be deferred until the 
conclusion of a victorious peace. In publishing 
articles bearing directly upon the crisis, THE 
DIAL is acting upon the presumption that those 
who enjoy literature are not adverse to doing 
their bit of thinking.

THE FAVORITE SON. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In THE DIAL of June 14, Mr. Randolph Bourne 
remarks of Theodore Dreiser, "There stirs in 
Dreiser's books a new American quality. It is an 
authentic attempt to make something artistic out 
of the chaotic materials that lie around us in 
American life." True enough, but if those are 
Mr. Bourne's sentiments, why doesn't he compare 
Dreiser with Frank Norris, who had the artist's 
vision along with the artist's sureness of tech- 
nique? 

Isn't the reason this? Mr. Dreiser's books ap- 
peal to Mr. Bourne because they concern them- 
selves altogether with the little wriggling microbe, 
man picturing his wrigglings, while time and 
eternity go marching on. Mr. Norris, on the con- 
trary, was interested not only in men, but also in 
the infinite, wonderful universe around them. 
"Man perishes, but the wheat goes on." Mr. 
Dreiser and Mr. Bourne can see and criticize their 
neighbors across the street. Mr. Norris's mind 
could take in a state, a nation, a world, a whole

A KEATS DISCOVERY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The acquisition of a bundle of unpublished let- 
ters written by John Clare, the Northamptonshire 
peasant-poet, to his publishers, Taylor and Hessey, 
who, it will be remembered, acted in the same 
capacity for Keats, brings to light the most ex- 
traordinary association-interest between two con- 
temporary poets, one great and both unfortunate, 
that has been recorded in recent years. For a 
supreme instant Fate seems to have brought her 
two nearest of kin together. 

In March of 1820, Clare came to London. His 
poems had already been printed with a preface 
by his publisher. "There was no limit to the ap- 
plause bestowed upon him," says his biographer, 
Frederic Martin. "Rossini set his verses to music; 
Madame Vestris recited them before crowded au- 
diences; William Gifford sang his praises in the 
'Quarterly Review'; and all the critical journals, 
reviews, and magazines of the day were unanimous 
in their admiration of poetical genius coming before 
them in the humble garb of a farm labourer." It 
was also the year of "Lamia" and of Keats's de- 
parture for Italy. 

But a few months later Keats lay dead in Rome 
and Clare's popularity had so far subsided that 
he wrote to James Montgomery, "My New Poems 
do not sell, Taylor tells me, and so I must either 
do better or do nothing. I expect the rage for 
novels being predominant is as much the cause as 
anything, and I hope a better time, if not a better 
taste, is to follow thereafter but I dare not ques- 
tion that." Apparently, the rage for fiction con- 
tinued long in the ascendant, for in 1837 Clare was 
led half starved and wholly insane to the county

madhouse at Northampton, where there commenced 
an oblivion for the poet that lasted to his death in 
1864. It is recorded that he "wrote occasionally 
to his son Charles, but appears never to have been 
visited by either relatives or friends. The neglect 
of his wife and children is inexplicable." And yet 
it was during this period that he contributed his 
finest efforts to literature. 

Among these documents is a single folio sheet 
torn from the context of an entire letter, bearing 
on one side the address, dated June 5, 1820, with 
Clare's inscription, "Cut round the Seal, Clare," 
and on the reverse a sprawling postscript comment- 
ing pathetically on the vicissitudes of his success 
with a noble patron "I forget to mention that I 
yesterday wrote a very strong letter to Sir Thos. 
Plumer. I am in hopes to receive from him Three 
pounds, not more. I have had some failures but 
this must necessarily be look'd for. . . Be- 

low this, in Keats's characteristic and beautiful 
handwriting are the lines 293 and 294 from 
"Lamia,"

He sank supine beside the aching ghost. 

which read in the original manuscript (H. Buxton 

Forman's edition) 

From Lycius answer'd, as he sunk supine 
Upon the couch where Lamia's beauties pine. 

It has been conjectured that Keats, visiting his 
publishers at their place of business, wrote the 
emendation for the original passage upon the near- 
est piece of paper that presented itself, and that 
this happened to be (strangely enough) a letter 
from Clare, then in London on a visit. "Poor 
Keats!" writes Clare in one of these letters con- 
cerning the preface to his "Village Minstrel," of 
1821, "I mention his name with reverence and 
regret. As to letting his name stand, do as yo- 
please, but it strikes me that 'except one* would 
be more appropriate not so personal and less fear 
of being misjudg'd partially as some would call 
it ... you know from what quarter I mean." 
By which it may be concluded that even Clare knew 
the pitfalls and pusillanimity of the critical eight- 
een-twcnties. SAMUEL LOVEMAN.

IRELAND'S DEBT TO FOREIGN SCHOLARS. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
I am obliged to Mr. Sapir for adding an impor- 
tant name to my list of foreign scholars whose 
work has helped the revival of Celtic lore. It w.i- 
inexcusable on my part to leave out of such a list 
the name of Rudolf Thurneysen: his name did not 
occur to me as I wrote, although, as I knew, he 
had been lecturing in Dublin recently at the School 
of Irish Learning. The name "d'Arbois de Jour- 
ainville" was, of course, a printer's error for 
"d'Arbois de Jubainville." But Mr. Sapir is wrong 
in regarding Whitley Stokes as an English scholar 
of Celtic. Whitley Stokes was an Irishman, of a 
well-known Dublin family, and his relative, Mar- 
garet Stokes, has done notable work in Irish arche- 
ology. Whitley Stokes went to India in the fifties 
and his emigration was deplored by the litcrarv 
and scholarly group that had centred round "The 



\ .'in." After his retirement from the Indian 
Civil Service he lived in London. 1 had tin- priv- 
ilege of meeting him there in his last days. He \\ .i> 
an Olympian old man. I remember his speaking 
of the introduction of exotic metres into English 
poetry. Browning, he said, had used Arabic metres 
in "Abt Vogler" and in "One Word More" al- 
though he had no knowledge whatever of Arabic 
poetry. Goethe, too, in his version of the Serbian 
ballad, "The Wife of Hassan Aga," had restored 
the original metre although he knew nothing of 
Slav poetry, and had taken the ballad from an 
Italian translation that gave no hint of the metre 
of the original. PADRAIC Con M.

JAPANESE POETRY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

It is reported that altogether about 37,000 verse- 
lets were submitted to the Imperial Court this year 
on the subject "Snow on the Distant Mountains. 
Of that grand total over 31,000 succeeded in pa^- 
ing the preliminary examination; and out of that 
enormous total only seven were selected as suitable 
for the Imperial audience. Those seven had the 
honor of being read in company with the verses 
edited by the Emperor and the Empress and other 
members of the Imperial family. 

I shall not attempt to give a literal translation, 
but I should like to set down the general idea, of 
the two poems by the Emperor and the Empress. 
The Emperor's, poem was to this effect: "How 
white the snow appears on the summit of Mount 
Fuji as seen over the pine twigs of the Imperial 
garden!" The Empress developed the theme that 
"The glory of the Imperial reign seems as bright 
as the snow on the distant mountains over the seas 
of Japan." Those are sadly prosaic renderings of 
beautiful, suggestive verses. 

The Empress has been so gracious as to grant 
to the Girls' Higher Normal School of Nara a 
special poem, of which the following crude transla- 
tion from "The Herald of Asia" may at least serve 
to give a general idea: 

Hailing the day's light, 

That rises bright 

Above Kasuga'a height, 

Blow, oh blow! ye beauteous sakura of hearts. 

Gather, oh gather, the tender buds of learning! 

From their pure source 

Do Saho's waters course, 

While on their brink, 

From ancient trunks 

The willows lush young shoots put forth. 

From out the old seeking the new, 

March, oh march, on life's highway! 

That poem of course is not a tanka, but what is 
called imayo, or "modern style"; it consists of eight 
lines of twelve or thirteen syllables each, in all 
about one hundred syllables. The Japanese word 
sakura, which is retained in the translation, means 
"cherry." The poem is especially cherished by the 
students because it is the composition of Her Maj- 
ERNEST W. CI.IM 

Tokyo, Japan.

The Anderson Company has obtained a lease for 
twenty-one years of the building formerly occu- 
pied by the Arion Society, Fifty-ninth Street and 
Park Avenue, New York. No alterations will be 
made in the exterior of the building, and only a 
few changes will be necessary in the interior. The 
company's old building at Fortieth Street and Madi- 
son Avenue, where the Robert Hoe library was 
sold, is now a thing of the past. This fine old 
mansion has been razed, and a twenty-three story 
office building will be erected on the site. 

On or about October 15, the company's new 
season will be opened by an important sale of 
English literature from the collection of Henry E. 
Huntington. Works of the value of about $150,000 
will then be dispersed. It will be the finest col- 
lection of English literature offered at auction since 
the Hoe sale. Mr. Huntington owns about thirty- 
seven of the Shakespeare folios. He will select 
the choicest examples for his library and sell the 
others. The Anderson Company now has in its 
keeping books from Mr. Huntington valued at 
about $300,000. All these will be sold. Mr. 
Huntington's taste is for fine bindings. His library 
is now in New York, but eventually will be re- 
moved to Los Angeles, California. 

In the death of William Holland Samson, on 
June 24, the Anderson Company sustained a severe 
loss. He was its vice-president, an old newspaper 
man who used the experience gained in that pro- 
fession to advance the company's interests. The 
past season had been a profitable and strenuous 
one. Mr. Samson was about to take his summer 
vacation at his cottage at Lake George, New York. 
He and his wife went on a short visit to Mr. 
Mitchell, treasurer of the Anderson Company, at 
Lake Mahopac. Mr. Samson was out on the 
lake in a row boat, fishing, when death came. He 
died of heart trouble. He was married to a sis- 
ter of W. K. Bixby, the well-known St. Louis 
book and autograph collector. She survives him. 

Among the rarest books of modern authors are 
some of the first editions of Robert Louis Steven- 
son and Rudyard Kipling. There are only two 
known copies of the former's "Penny Whistles," 
printed in 1883, a collection of verses for children. 
The Borden sale at the American Art Galleries 
on February 17, 1913, contained one of these copies. 
It was bought for $2500 by Mrs. Widener, of 
Philadelphia, and added to the Stevensoniana col- 
lection of her son, Harry Elkins Widener, who 
lost his life in the Titanic disaster. This collection 
is now in Cambridge, Mass., having been presented 
to Harvard University. James F. Drake paid 
$650 for the "Smith Administration" by Kipling, 
in the Williamson library sale. He subsequently 
sold it for $900.

graph dealer, has changed his name to Gabriel

W. J. Locke has unravelled in this, his best

Though it has war for its background, "The

setting in a quiet English village, where 
dwell the mothers and fathers, the wives and 
sweethearts of those who are out "some-

and quiet courage and mystery. And the 
old soldier who can no longer serve his 
country thrills you with the story of it all.

ENGLISH 
LITERATURE 

AN INTRODUCTION AND GUIDE 
TO THE BEST ENGLISH BOOKS 

A HANDBOOK FOR SCHOOLS AND READERS

The Needed Quality 

The quality' of a manual on English Lit- 
erature is probably more important than 
that of any other book in use. Literature is 
nothing, if it is not a living source of in- 
spiration or pleasure, it cannot be taught 
as a dead language, or a mathematical 
formula. With this in mind Professor Miller 
planned his new text-book. 

What Sometimes Happens 

It is generally acknowledged that the 
reading habit is often greatly weakened 
sometimes completely destroyed in the 
schools. Tennyson knew this and despaired 
upon learning that "Enoch Arden" had been 
adopted for class-room study. Dates and 
places are important but less important than 
the ideals, ideas and purposes of the great 
writers as shown in their works. Too often 
the boy's or girl's study of fact obscures the 
core of the subject the beauty, the stimu- 
lus. How often is this the fault of text- 
books, the introduction to a live matter 
through a dead medium? 

What Should Be the Object 

The object of text-books in English Liter- 
erature should be to stimulate readers to a 
love and appreciation of the best and to 
lead them into the habit of reading the good 
and great books for enjoyment as well as 
learning. This new book by Professor Miller 
has been planned throughout with this in 
mind. The pages are not burdened with 
facts but with stimulating ideas. Emphasis 
is laid upon forces and influences not upon 
dates. During the preparation of the book 
the author gave careful consideration to 
every important pedagogical principle. 
Isn't that the right sort of book for in- 
troducing young people to the vast field of 
Literature which is intended for the inter- 
pretation and enrichment of life?

P. F. Madigan, of 561 Fifth Avenue. New York, 
has obtained a Revolutionary War letter, written 
by Colonel Ethan Allen of the "Green Mountain 
Boys" to General Richard Mnnmomen , at Saint 
John's, Canada, and dated September 20, 1775. 
\I: Madigan believes that the letter is unpub- 
lished. It reads as follows: 

Excellent Sir: I am now in the parish of Saint 
Tuores, four leagues to the South; have two hundred 
and fifty Canadians under arms; as I march they 
gather fast; these are the object of taking the ves- 
sels in Sorel and General Carleton. These objects 
I pass by to assist the army besieging Saint Johns; 
if the place be taken the country is ours; if we 
miscarry in this, all our other achievements will 
profit but little. I am fearful our army will be sickly, 
and that the siege may be hard, therefore rhux- 
to assist in conquering Saint Johns, which, of con- 
sequence conquers the whole. You may rely on it 
that I shall join you in about three days with about 
five hundred or more Canadian volunteers. I could 
raise one or two thousand in a week's time, but will 
first visit the army with a less number, and, if 
necessary, will go again recruiting those that used to 
be enemies to our cause. Come cap in hand to me, 
and I sware by the Lord I can raise three times the 
number of our army in Canada, provided you con- 
tinue the siege. All depends on that. It is with 
the advice of the officers with me that I speedily 
repair to the army. God grant you wisdom, forti- 
tude and every accomplishment of a victorious gen- 
eral. The eyes of all America, nay of Europe, are 
or will be on the economy of this army, and the 
consequence attending it. I am your most obedient 
and humble serv't. Ethan Allen. 
P. S. I have purch'ased four hogsheads of rum, 
and sent a sergent with a small party to deliver it 
at headquarters, and Mr. Livingston and others under 
him will provide what fresh beef you need. As to 
bread and flower I am forwarding what I can. You 
may rely on my utmost attention to this object, as 
well as raising axuillaries. I know the ground is 
swampy and bad raising batteries, but pray let no 
object of obstruction be insurmountable. The gl<>r\ 
of a victory, which will be attended with such im- 
portant consequences, will crown all our fatigues. 
risques and labors; to fail of victory will be our 
eternal disgrace, but to obtain it will elevate us on 
the wings of fame. Yours, etc. Ethan Allen. 

Of great interest to American collectors is the 
sale, at Sotheby's in London on July 30, of the 
remaining portion of the famous collection of earh 
Americana formed by the Rev. Dr. White Kennett, 
Bishop of Peterborough (1660-1728), with certain 
other books the property of the Society for the 
Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. 
Bishop Kennett was one of the original members 
of this society and in order to advance its interests 
made a collection of books, charts, maps, and docu- 
ments relating to the general subject of discoveries 
and colonization of foreign lands, and the. attempts 
made to propagate the Gospel, especially in the 
English possessions in America, the East Indies. 
and Africa. He gave this collection to the societ\ 
in 1712.

A Soldier 

of France to 

His Mother 

"For him who knows how to 
read life, these present events have 
torn to shreds our old habits of 
thought and have revealed more 
clearly than ever before eternal 
beauty and order." 

In this unpretentious record of 
the intimate thoughts and emotions 
of a young French artist under the 
reaction of war there is revealed a 
spiritual splendor which transcends 
sordid tragedy. 

So vividly has the note of French 
exaltation found expression in 
these letters that the book met in- 
stant recognition upon its publica- 
tion in France, where it ran into 
many editions and is now regarded 
as one of the outstanding pieces of 
war literature. 

Readers of The Dial will be in- 
terested in knowing that the book 
published in France under the name 
of Lettres d'un Soldat first came to 
the attention of the American pub- 
lishers through Theodore Stanton's 
praise of it in his Paris Letter in

which he obtained on his last visit to New 
York. The library comprises many first 
editions, standard sets and a very unusual 
collection of good books for reading and ref- 
erence; in fact, such a collection of really 
interesting books of all classes of literature 
is rarely placed upon the market. 

A catalogue of this library will be issued sometime 
in September. Copies will be sent on application.

life can give.

WHAT WOMEN CAN DO in wartime. 
The supreme achievement of French women

it; their relation to families, husbands 
and children, and many other topics

NEW BOOKS I 


A Soldier of France to 
His Mother 

The brief story of an artist-soldier who, when 
France called, forsook his brush and his studio to 
serve his country with the Poillus in the trenches. 
The work is in the form of letters written by him 
to his mother during the early period of the war. 
They are wonderful letters, unique because they 
reveal the tragic recoil of the artist-soul from the 
brutalities of war. He abhors war but he loves 
his country more and so he does not flinch from 
his duty. No work touching on the war has 
approached this in the personal and intimate aspect 
which it presents of the soldier in the trenches. 
Translated with an introduction by Theodore 
Stanton, M.A. Price, $1.00 

Evenings With Great 

AuthorS By SHERWIN CODY 

Vol. I. How and What to Read; Shakespeare, Lincoln. 
Vol. II. Scott, Dickens, Thackeray. 

Great authors are for the people. The books they 
wrote were not bought because they were great 
literature, but because they gave an insight into 
life, rested the heart, and lightened the burden of 
daily living. Mr. Cody pleasantly introduces us 
to great authors and their books, giving a little 
taste here and there of the enjoyment to be found. 
He is one of the ablest of guides. 
ISmo. Price per volume, $1.00 

Ultimate Democracy and Its 

Making By NEWELL L. SIMS, A.M., Ph.D. 

This is an investigation and study of the demo- 
cratic idea, beginning with the primitive democ- 
racy of the original savage and then following 
the progress of the democratic concept through the 
ages to a final examination and appraisal of the 
active democratic forces in the social organization 
of today. The purpose of the book is enlighten- 
ment on the subject of Democracy, to make plain 
what it is, its aims, its achievements, and whither 
it is trending. Large IZmo. $1.50 

The Principles of Natural 

Taxation By c. B. FILLEBROWN 

To set forth the genesis and progress of the plans 
formulated by a certain school of economists for 
the taxation of economic rent is the aim of this 
work. These plans are otherwise known as the 
single-tax doctrine, popularly ascribed to and 
championed by Henry George. The doctrine, how- 
ever, is almost as old as the science of political 
economy itself, Adam Smith being the first, per- 
haps, to expound it. Portraits. l?mo. $1.50 


The Rustler of Wind River 

By G. W. OGDEN 

A story that thrills one from the start. It has 
the atmosphere of the broad plains and the excite- 
ment of conflict between irreconcilable forces of 
society. And through it all is the thread of an 
absorbing romance. Price, $1.30 

Myths and Legends of 
British North America 

By KATHARINE B. JUDSON, A.M. 

The myths in this volume are those of the native 
tribes of British North America, chosen with care 
for their representative value and related with that 
solicitude for the preservation of the original form 
which has marked all of Miss Judson's studies in 
mythology. Illustrated. Small quarto. $1.50 


New Volumes in the 
National Social Science Series 


The Psychology of 
Citizenship 

By ARLAND D. WEEKS 

A study of the psychology of our relations to civic 
affairs. Society, the author contends, is now seek- 
ing social ends as truly as the individual seeks 
personal ends, and the individual in order to get 
what he wants must combine his efforts with those 
of others. 

The State and Government 

By JEREMIAH S. YOUNG, Ph.D. 

The purpose of this very readable book is to make 
clear to the general reader the underlying princi- 
ples of the state, and its agent, the government. 

Social Environment 

By GEORGE R. DAVIES, Ph.D. 

The aim of this work is to set forth the nature of 
society as primarily a spiritual rather than a 
biological reality, the term spiritual being used in 
a broad sense.

A SOLDIER'S MEMORIES IN PEACE AND WAR 



By SIR GEORGE YOUNGHUSBAND 



Net, $5.00 



The Boston Transcript in its issue of July 17th gives this book a three-column review headed "The Man Who 
Lived 'Arabian Nights.' An outpouring of tales wild, romantic, and merry by Sir George Younghusband, 
first white man in Tibet, about his escapades in the East." It then states that it is "most worthy of men- 
tion not merely because Sir George has seen brisk and various service in many climes and conditions, but 
because he has the narration faculty allied to a genuine wit and an incorrigible love of adventure and sport. 
In this book he avoids heroics and such well-worn themes as famous battles ; his business is to embroider them 
with illustrations of men and motives. A remarkable all-around book of good and racy stories." 



RUSSIAN MEMORIES. By MADAM OLGA NOVIKOFF. Net, $3.50 

Boston Transcript says: "It is a sincere analysis of the relations between Russia and England as she has 
observed them during the last fifty years. And the personality shown in her writing is one of great intelligence 



and charm." 



RUSSIAN COURT MEMOIRS 1914-1916 M.VM 

The Argonaut says : "It is a work of real value for the study of what has been taking place during the 
past three years at Petrograd. The fact that it is authoritative does not in the least detract from its 
fascination, and every page is full of interest." 



A NATURALIST IN BORNEO 

By ROBERT W. C. SHELFORD Net, $5.00 

Westminster Gazette says : "Do you want a legiti- 
mate distraction for an hour at a time ? Then pur- 
chase this book and you will find it much more 
thrilling than any novel of adventure, for it is 
all adventures in the fairy land of Science and 
almost more incredible than any fairy romance 
conceived. Nevertheless it is packed with undi- 
luted truth from the first page to the last. It is 
a work destined to become one of the classics 
of natural history to rank with books by Bates and 
Humboldt, Wallace, and Fabre." 

CIVILIZED COMMERCIALISM 

By ERNEST G. STEVENS Net, $1.25 

An application of democracy to business. It 
outlines a scheme, sane, modern, and just for 
eliminating oppression, czarism, and cut-throat 
competition from business and yet of permitting 
the fullest useful growth and activity to business 
corporations of any size. 

THE BOOK OF HOME NURSING 

By FRANCES CAMPBELL Net, $1.25 

A practical guide for the Treatment of Sickness 
in the Home. A most invaluable book for all 
homes. Mrs. Campbell, herself a trained nurse, 
does not try to teach you to be a trained nurse, 
but she does tell you what to do in an emergency 
and how to care for the sick in your household. 

DAY AND NIGHT STORIES 

By ALGERNON BLACKWOOD Net, $1.50 

Mr. Blackwood is the author of "Julius LeVallon," 
"The Wave," "The Centaur," "Ten Minute Stories," 
and "The Education of Uncle Paul," anyone of 
which would make the reputation of a new writer. 
He is a master of the mystical and a pioneer in the 
peculiar. This new collection of short stories con- 
tains material as bizarre and as unusual as any 
of his works. It is worth reading whether you 
know Mr. Blackwood or not. 



CANADA THE SPELLBINDER 

By LILIAN WHITING Net, $2.50 

The Nation says : "Lilian Whiting's enthusiasm 
of spirit and glow of language are at their usual 
high level in 'Canada and Spellbinder.' One is 
carried from the great to the greater, from the 
bountiful to the more bountiful, from the beau- 
tiful to the more beautiful until one's power of 
appreciation is all but suffocated with the intoxi- 
cating draught." 

STUDIES IN INSECT LIFE 
AND OTHER ESSAYS 

By A. E. SHIPLEY Net, $3.50 

Giving not only some delightful chapters on in- 
sects and war on the honey bee and the humble 
bee, on grouse disease, and on the romance of 
the deep sea, but he gives also an account of 
Zoology as understood in Shakespeare's time, and 
of the revival of science in the seventeenth century. 

AMERICA'S CASE AGAINST 
GERMANY 

By LINDSAY ROGERS Net, $1.50 

A precise and untechnical statement of the points 
at issue and a full explanation of the legal grounds 
of the American position. The legal part is only 
one part of our case against Germany, but it is a 
primary and indispensable one and should be un- 
derstood by every intelligent citizen. 

A STUDENT IN ARMS 

By DONALD HANKEY Net, $1.50 

The Argonaut: "The best the war has produced." 
Bellman: "One of the most forceful and genuine 
books inspired by the world's conflict." 
Baltimore Sun: "Bursting with things we all want 
to know." 

Just Published Second Series of Donald 
Hankey's "A Student in Arms" Net, $1.50 

More of Hankey's beautiful work, with interesting 

details of the author's life. 



HELEN OF FOUR GATES AW.II.SO 

The author of this extraordinary "first book" is referred to in England as one of the most remarkable writers 
of recent years. Thomas Hardy strongly commends the book. 

New York Times: "Has brought a new note to current fiction, a note that excels in sheer emotional power, in 
beauty of tone, in imagination, any voice that is now telling stories to the English-speaking people."

"This is the need of Mexico today opportunity to

clothing, better shelter, and better social conditions. 

"And this is exactly what American and European

ultimately redeem Mexico and forward her people by in-

CHRISTINE, 



By Alice Cholmondeley 



Who can forget Hugh Britling's letters to his father in Mr. Wells' re- 
markable novel, "Mr. Britling Sees It Through"? Christine reveals the same 
fine understanding between a mother and her daughter. Full of beauty and 
poignant with true sentiment, few will read without tears this story of an 
English girl in Germany which brings home the ennobling pathos of the great 
war as few novels have done.

Creative Criticism 



If contemporary criticism were to be 
judged by such practice of it as appears in 
magazines and even the more serious 
books, it would force one to believe that 
it had advanced very little, if at all, since 
the days when Aristotle declared that one 
of the critic's functions is to censure a 
work of art as being "morally hurtful 
or contrary to technical correct- 
ness." To be sure, our notions of 
correctness, as well as our ethics, have 
changed; but, for the most part, we have 
merely substituted new conventions for 
old, new prejudices, new rules and tabu- 
lations. The very men who laugh at the 
old discussions concerning "the unities," 
themselves condemn all dramas that do 
not conform to a purely arbitrary thing 
called "dramaturgy" ; and a well-known 
professor has asserted that "King Lear" 
is not a play at all since its climax comes 
in the first act! In somewhat similar 
fashion, a recent biographer of Dostoev- 
sky, after proving in a long introduction 
that a novel cannot be defined, proves 
also that Dostoevsky was not a novelist ! 

Such ludicrous opinions are, of course, 
due to the common supposition that there 
are genres, or predetermined forms into 
which the artist pours his thought. It 
seems almost impossible for critics to 
realize that an idea is form, that the idea 
is the form. It cannot be embodied. 
Every idea is a new idea; every work of 
art is a new work, a new genre. The 
artist may wrangle with his germinal 
impulse, twist and distort it to fit some 
theory of form; but just in so far as he 
does so, he toils against himself. 

The critic's misconception of these 
matters arises partly from lack of ability 
and partly from sheer laziness. A man 
of ordinary intellect may easily find super- 
ficial resemblances, classify them, talk of 
them as constituting a genre, and then 
proceed to discuss the work of art at hand 
in relation to the factitious structure he 



has made. On the other hand, to appre- 
hend a work of art creatively requires a 
taste allied in its functioning to genius, 
and the use of an energy not different in 
kind from that exercised by the artist 
himself. 

Probably the first great step toward 
what we may call modern criticism that 
is, modern criticism at its best was taken 
when Goethe insisted upon the necessity 
of ascertaining "what the poet's aim really 
and truly was, how the task he had to do 
stood before his eye, and how far, with 
such materials as were afforded him, he 
had fulfilled it." At about the same time, 
Coleridge, the most keenly intuitive of 
English critics, hinted at an extension of 
this idea when he said that, in order to 
read the difficult metres of Donne and 
thoroughly to understand his poems, 
it was necessary practically to become 
Donne. The significance of Coleridge's 
remark seems to have been unappreciated 
even by himself, since he failed to general- 
ize it or to apply it in a consideration of 
other poetry; and all posterior aestheti- 
cians, without exception, have overlooked 
it. Goethe's idea, however, underwent a 
fairly steady development, and culminated 
in the conception of Benedetto Croce that 
every work of art is an organism governed 
solely by its own law. Upon this and the 
many other conceptions so brilliantly pro- 
pounded in his "Aesthetic," Mr. Spingarn 
bases his essays entitled "Creative Criti- 
cism" (Holt). 

The latter's book is far less substantial 
and, quite properly, far more controversial 
than that of the Italian. The "Aesthetic" 
is obtainable in an excellent English trans- 
lation, and its lucidly reasoned exposition 
of theory needs only popularization and 
defence. For this task no one in England 
or America is better qualified than Mr. 
Spingarn, whose erudition is coupled with 
intellectual passion and the gift of power- 
ful, if sometimes impatient, expression. 



THE DIAL 



[August 



The present volume begins with a 
lecture called "The New Criticism." 
Here, after briefly setting forth the princi- 
ples of impressionistic and of dogmatic 
criticism, the author points out that they 
are essentially a mere continuation of the 
old battle between the Romanticists and 
the Classicists, between those who seek to 
enjoy and those who desire to judge. As 
far back as the sixteenth century, Pietro 
Aretino was asserting that there is no rule 
save the whim of genius, no standard 
of criticism save individual taste; while 
Scaliger was helping to formulate the 
classical code and declaring that Aristotle 
is "the perpetual dictator of all the fine 
arts." The next century exposes the same 
antinomy in France, where it has continued 
until the present hour. These opposing 
types, Mr. Spingarn speaks of as "the two 
sexes of criticism . . . the masculine 
criticism that may or may not force its 
own standards on literature, but that never 
at all events is dominated by the object of 
its studies; and the feminine criticism that 
responds to the lure of art with a kind of 
passive ecstasy." 

The eighteenth century produced no 
fundamental contributions for the old 
quarrel until the Romantic Movement 
stressed the element of expression, either 
of society (Mme. de Stael), or of person- 
ality (Sainte-Beuve), or of race, age, and 
environment (Taine). The first, how- 
ever, "to give philosophic precision to the 
theory of expression, and to found a 
method of criticism based upon it, were 
the Germans of the age that stretches from 
Herder to Hegel." But it was left for a 
Neapolitan, Croce, to lead "aesthetic 
thought inevitably from the concept that 
art is expression to the conclusion that all 
expression is art." 

This part of Mr. Spingarn's book can- 
not be too highly praised, and it should 
have distinct value even for the Classicists, 
since it affords the most succinct history 
of modern critical theory, besides being, 
by its grouping of facts, an original inter- 
pretation. The remainder of the essay is 
a summary of Croce's ideas and a very 
cleverly argued invective against dogma- 
tism in all its forms. Following a method 
similar to that of Zola in his famous 
"J'accuse" Mr. Spingarn attacks the idea 



of genres, or literary kinds, of the theory 
"I style, of metaphor, simile, and "all the 
old terms of classical rhetoric," of moral 
judgment of literature, the "confusion be- 
tween the drama and the theatre," of 
technique as separate from art, the criti- 
cism of poetic themes, of race, time, and 
environment as an element in criticism, of 
the "evolution" of literature, the concept 
of progress, and, finally, "the old rupture 
between genius and taste." 

Obviously, there is here much matter 
for consideration, too much indeed to 
come within the limits of a review. If 
Mr. Spingarn's dismaying contentions 
were accepted or even merely sadly 
absorbed, what would become of our col- 
lege professors with their courses on 
rhetoric, the forms of literature, and the 
history of prose style; or of our doctors 
of philosophy with their theses comparing, 
for instance, the grammatical construc- 
tions of ^Eschylus and Tennyson? Ami 
how should one write a book on the works 
of any great artist if one had to judge 
those works separately and thus to dis- 
card the convention that there is always 
a period of apprenticeship, a period of 
fulfilment, a period of deterioration? 
For, be it noted, if a Milton, after a life 
dedicated to beauty and to toil, achieves 
the sublime austerity of a "Samson Ago- 
nistes," the critics invariably find in such 
a masterpiece the signs of waning power, 
of aridity, decay; or if a Michelangelo 
finally attains the almost abstract grandeur 
seen in many of the designs for the cele- 
bration of Christ's Passion, there in- 
evitably appears a J. A. Symonds to see 
in them only the "autumn stubbles of 
declining genius". 

In the second essay, Mr. Spingarn is 
concerned only with "Dramatic Criti- 
cism." This section of his book is an 
extraordinarily brilliant example of dia- 
lectical writing and of irony and humor 
in the service of clear, sound thought. For 
the curious, perhaps the most interesting 
part is that in which the author deals with 
Lodovico Castelvetro, who, as early as 
1570, broached the theory of the drama 
that is now associated with the names ot 
Mr. William Archer and Mr. A. B. Walk- 
lev and of their "noisy but ne^li^ihle 
echoes in our own eountrv." It is this 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



97 



theory that Mr. Spingarn sets himself 
most vigorously to combat. 

Castelvetro, like the moderns, em- 
phasized the conditions of stage repre- 
sentation: the size of the theatre, the 
motley crowd, the limitation of time. 
Bacon, Diderot, and many others, also 
dwelt on what is to-day discussed, with an 
amusing air of originality, as the "psy- 
chology of the crowd"; and even Voltaire 
thought to reform the drama by changing 
the theatre. We need not detain our- 
selves with the tenets of Lessing, Schlegel, 
Lamb, Grillparzer, and the others who 
fought and re-fought the battle that began 
when Castelvetro challenged the all- 
powerful standards of Aristotle. It is not 
until we come to Francisque Sarcey that 
we have a really full and clear exposition 
of the theory of dramatic materialism that 
now reigns almost without dispute on both 
sides of the Atlantic; but even his famous 
"Essai d'une Esthetique de Theatre" is 
of less immediate interest for us than the 
writings of Mr. Archer, Mr. Walkley, 
and "the negligible echoes." 

The chief assertions of these gentlemen 
are. all founded on a confusion between 
"inner impulse and outer influence." Mr. 
Walkley, for instance, affirms that the 
dramatic critic must "sit tight" against 
the prejudices and opinions of audiences 
and then tells us that the playwright must 
be judged by his effect -on the "peculiar 
psychology of the crowd he is addressing." 
Confusion could scarcely confound itself 
more fully! It seems unnecessary to ask 
why, if the measure of the dramatist's 
genius is to be judged by its effect on the 
crowd, the critic should "sit tight" against 
the very thing that would enable him to 
estimate that genius; or how the critic, if 
he imposes on the artist one standard and 
on himself another, can hope to under- 
stand the former and evaluate his work. 

But without this confusion and with- 
out the rules of "dramaturgy," we should 
have very few critics of the drama, since 
few there are whose creative powers are 
highly enough developed to enable them 
to put themselves in the place of the artist, 
thus discovering the urges and intentions 
of his work, and then, having experienced 
what he experienced, to estimate his 
measure of success. As it is, almost any- 



one can go, like a second-rate dog fancier 
carrying his standard of conformation, 
and appraise with perfect assurance what- 
ever the contemporary stage may offer. 
If he but apply his rules, perceive where 
the play falls outside of them and where 
within, and consider the audience while 
he "sits tight" against it, he may be sure 
that whatever issues from his pen will 
pass as criticism of an art! 

It is in dealing with such "criticism" 
that Mr. Spingarn carries furthest his in- 
vective an invective thrust perhaps a 
little too far when he characterizes Mr. 
Archer as "a connoisseur of stale plati- 
tudes, angered and confused by the 
thought of a new age impatient at his 
commonplaces." Very refreshing, how- 
ever, is it to find someone to whom things 
intellectual are sufficiently stimulating to 
call forth impassioned utterance instead of 
the usual dreary locutions of philosophi- 
cal debate. 

The last two essays are, comparatively, 
of less importance than the first two. In 
"Verse and Prose," Mr. Spingarn finds it 
necessary to descant upon a good deal of 
familiar matter in order satisfactorily to 
prove that "whatever distinction exists 
between words in metre and words with- 
out it exists in exactly the same way be- 
tween verses written in the same metre"; 
and that "rhythm and metre must be re- 
garded as aesthetically identical with style, 
as style is identical with artistic form, 
and form in its turn is the work of art in 
its spiritual and indivisible self." 

The last essay is a letter to an artist on 
the International Exhibition, February, 
1913. It expresses, with rather vague 
enthusiasm, the author's admiration for 
the spirit of the show, and then, character- 
istically, goes back to the Italian Renais- 
sance, but only in order to point out the 
well-known fact that the great patrons of 
that time fostered creation whereas our 
American millionaires merely load their 
rooms with old masterpieces. There is, 
however, a valuable and suggestive pas- 
sage in which Mr. Spingarn shows how 
the collector, like the critic, may become 
creative in the realm of taste. 

Lastly, in an appendix, we find a little 
model of effective controversial writing 
a tilt at Mr. Galsworthy's objections to 



98

[August lt> 



the author's "New Criticism" wherein 
we are once more led to the conclusion 
that "by genius is now merely meant the 
creative faculty, the power of self-expres- 
sion, which we all share in varying 
degrees." 

In finishing a review of so admirable a 
book, it may be ungracious, but it should 
not be amiss, to say that the author is too 
rare a combination of scholarship and 
critical acumen to be heard from so 
seldom. Without being impertinent 
enough to advise Mr. Spingarn as to his 
activities, one may notice the fact that 
Croce conducts the most important criti- 



cal magazine in Italy, the most vital in 
Europe, and that Mr. Spingarn is com- 
petent to do the same thing for the 
United States. Studies by him of con- 
temporary or past men of letters would be 
welcomed by all lovers of literature and 
would be stimulating especially to the 
younger generation, who are still fed 
largely upon the pabulum of Arnold with 
the old notions or a "grand style" and of 
what is "best" in literature. To attack 
theory with theory is valuable; but, once 
the foundations are laid, it is even better 
to attack practice with practice. 

BAYARD BOYESEN. 



The Twilight of Rhyme 



In a time that now seems strangely re- 
mote I happened to drop in on a meeting 
of an Ottawa debating club in which 
President Wilson's peace note to the bel- 
ligerent nations was being discussed. Af- 
ter we had been treated to a couple of 
innocently academic utterances, the floor 
was taken by a rather elderly, choleric- 
looking Englishman of very determined 
manner and voice. He woke us up. In a 
rambling discourse that had little connec- 
tion with the ostensible subject of debate, 
he aired his views and feelings mightily. 
He convinced those of us that had a mind 
to be convinced that President Wilson's 
policy had been marked by a consistent 
pusillanimity worthy only of contempt, that 
the American people as a whole (and he 
knew all about it, for he had only recently 
visited the United States) were criminally 
lukewarm about the war, and that the only 
permanent hope for world peace lay, not 
in any professorial, Wilsonite notes, but 
in the strong arm of British sea-power. 
All of which, it need scarcely be said, was 
liberally punctuated by blazing eyes, wav- 
ing arms, and clarion intonations. Some 
of us later, incautiously and vainly, looked 
for an intelligible argument or two in the 
Englishman's flow of rhetoric. No mat- 
ter we were all carried away at the mo- 
ment, and when he ended up with a 
triumphant snort and a bang, our answer- 
ing applause was nothing if not sincere. 
Only the cultured elite can resist mere elo- 
quence. I lay no claim to membership 



in that very exclusive species of humanity. 
Yet I was vain enough to take a certain 
pride in my failure to respond as unre- 
servedly as most of the audience to our 
orator's fiery outburst of British patri- 
otism. It was the old man's fault. Had 
he not quoted rhymed poetry at the tail 
end of his peroration, I should have 
drowned with the rest. That poetry of his 
was just the straw needed for a drowning 
man's clutch. It tided me over nicely. 
Indeed, after a fitting interval of sur- 
charged silence, the memory of those 
rhymes, still tingling like a box on the 
ear, inspired me. with courage to get up 
and, in the very teeth of the storm raised 
by the great man, to put in an apologetic 
word for Mr. Wilson. 

This was what the orator quoted, with 
a fervor that sent shivers down our backs : 

Breathes there a man with soul so dead 
Who never to himself hath said, 
"This is my own, my native land!" 

and some more to the same effect. "Aha !" 
said I to myself, "is it some of Scott's old 
doggerel you are trying to palm off on 
us?" But it was Max Eastman who was 
uppermost in my thoughts just then. His 
"Lazy Verse" crusade had branched off 
even into the wilds of Canada and I was 
still vicariously smarting from the whip 
blows he had administered the lazy prac- 
titioners of the free-verse habit. Quick 
as lightning I saw my chance; in a second 
I had Mr. Eastman by the throat. Here 
was a moment of intense social conscious- 



1917]

ness, of patriotic emotion vivid and sin- 
cere, demanding aesthetic resources, it 
would seem, for its consummate expres- 
sion. The old man, in his instinctive grop- 
ing for a climax, felt the need too and 
chose a bungling anticlimax! Had he but 
called in the aid of measured blank verse 
or, preferably, free verse, he might have 
succeeded in producing a truly climactic 
effect. But what had such inane jingles as 
dead said, shed bed, Ted Fred, to 
do with the expression of heightened feel- 
ing? What concern had we, stirred to the 
patriotism that dealt and suffered death, 
to do with pretty boudoir tricks and ro- 
coco curtseys? It was the most magnifi- 
cent test case one could have desired. The 
verse came quite unexpectedly, the emo- 
tion was already there to be definitely 
crystallized. In my own case, alas ! it suf- 
fered collapse. Evidently rhyme had not 
stood the test. Mr. Eastman, in so far as 
he lays stress on rhyme as a sincere aes- 
thetic device, might question the diagnos- 
tic value of my experience. He might 
accuse the evident tawdriness of the lines 
themselves of the disconcerting effect pro- 
duced upon me, not to speak of other psy- 
chological analyses less flattering to my 
aesthetic sensibility. No doubt the lines 
stand in somewhat helpless contrast to the 
emotion they are supposed to call forth, 
but I do think it was quite specifically the 
rhyme as such that shunted me on to the 
wrong track. 

Rhyme, I decided, might do very well 
for certain lighter forms of poetry, the 
fluffy ruffles of literary art drinking 
songs, sentimental but not too seriously 
felt love ditties, vers de societe, popular 
ballads, and quite a number of other 
genres one might mention. In short, its 
value seemed purely decorative at best and 
not indispensably decorative at that. I 
decided that one could allow for it where 
graceful trifling or purely technical sound- 
effects were in order, but that its employ- 
ment in conjunction with deep feeling was 
perilous, to say the least. I had for years 
had an instinctive dislike for the jingle of 
rhyme in all but the lighter forms of verse, 
and it seemed that my dislike had experi- 
mentally justified itself in a flash of insight. 

Incidentally, I could not help feeling 



impressed by the purely ethnological con- 
sideration that rhyme is rarely, if ever, 
found in the lyrics of primitive people, 
whereas there is probably not a tribe that 
does not possess its stock of measured 
songs. Whatever our attitude to the prob- 
lem of strictly measured or polyphonic 
verse in our own artistic levels, it is very 
evident that a set rhythm at least does an- 
swer to a primal human trend, that rhyme, 
on the other hand, is no more than a bit 
of technical flavoring that happened to be- 
come habitual in Occidental poetry at a 
certain period not so far removed from 
the present after all. Rhyme is merely 
a passing notion of our own particular 
cultural development, like chivalry or 
alchemy or falconry or musical canons or 
a thousand-and-one other interesting no- 
tions now dead or moribund. Some of 
these notions, like rhyme, still vegetate 
(for that matter, canons are still composed 
by students of counterpoint), but they can- 
not be allowed to cumber the earth for- 
ever. No doubt rhyme will some day be 
thrown into the limbo that harbors its first 
cousin, alliteration. Some day all sensitive 
ears will be as much outraged by its em- 
ployment in passionate verse as by the 
musical expression of flaming desire in the 
pattern of a formal fugue. 

Mr. Eastman contends that rhyme, like 
rhythm, has a certain disciplinary value 
which is of direct aesthetic benefit, in so far 
as it imposes a wholesome restraint on the 
artist. Rhyme sets definite technical lim- 
itations that tax the poet's ingenuity. He 
has to solve technical problems, and in 
their solution he is braced to the utmost 
limit of his powers of concentration, of 
clarity of vision, of self-expression. A 
chastening halt is put to a too easily satis- 
fied, a too glibly facile flow of expression. 
The aesthetic product, which must of 
course appear perfectly natural and un- 
hampered, is all the more refined and po- 
tent for the painful struggle that has 
preceded its birth. The dynamic value of 
the overcoming of conflict in aesthetic pro- 
duction is by no means to be lightly set 
aside. Where Mr. Eastman errs, it seems 
to me, is in the narrow and specific appli- 
cations he makes of the principle. Just as 
soon as an external and purely formal 



100 



THE DIAL 



[August 16 



aesthetic device ceases to be felt as inher- 
ently essential to sincerity of expression, 
it ceases to remain merely a condition of 
the battling for self-expression and be- 
comes a tyrannous burden, a perfectly use- 
less fetter. The disciplinary argument is 
then seen to belong to precisely the same 
category as the conservative plea for the 
educational value of Latin or for the 
wholesome restraining influence of an out- 
lived body of religious belief. In other 
words, there is no absolute standard by 
which to measure the validity of a formal 
aesthetic device. Necessary or self-evident 
in one age, it is an encumbrance in an- 
other. Perfection of form is always es- 
sential, but the definition of what consti- 
tutes such perfection cannot, must not, be 
fixed once for all. The age, the individual 
artist, must solve the problem ever anew, 
must impose self-created conditions, per- 
haps only dimly realized, of the battle to 
be fought in attaining self-expression. It 
would be no paradox to say that it is the 
blind acceptance of a form imposed from 
without that is, in the deepest sense, "lazy," 
for such acceptance dodges the true for- 
mal problem of the artist the arrival, in 
travail and groping, at that mode of ex- 
pression that is best suited to the unique 
conception of the artist. The "best" may, 
of course, be many; it is necessarily con- 
ditioned by temperament. Mr. Eastman's 
error, then, would seem to be the rather 
elementary confusion of form (an inner 
striving) with formalism (an outer ob- 
stacle). 

But Mr. Eastman seems to go further. 
He would not merely preserve rigid met- 
rical forms and even rhyming schemes as 
essential to the satisfaction of our craving 
for poetic form, but he seems also to have 
regard for virtuosity as such. He speaks 
almost as if the greater the number and 
difficulty of formal limitations, the greater 
or more admirable the aesthetic result. 
This should mean that the pinnacle of 
poetic art has been reached in the Skaldic 
verse of Old Norse literature, perhaps the 
most artificial verse patterns ever devised. 
Here we have alliteration, assonance, ex- 
treme brevity of lines, and the use of highly 
conventional metaphorical modes of ex- 
pression four difficult masters to serve at 
the same time. De gustibus! 



In truth there is no greater superstition 
th;in the belief in the ever-growing com- 
plexity of all the outer forms of life and 
art. Progress in both means, on the con- 
trary, an ever-increasing will and ability to 
do without the swaddling clothes of ex- 
ternal form. The "freedom" of primi- 
tive culture is only an illusion, gained 
partly by the freshness of contrast with 
our own order of restraints, partly, 
and chiefly, by the imperfectly developed 
techniques of lower levels. Formally 
the great languages of modern civili- 
zation are very much simpler, very much 
less virtuoso-like, than most of the lan- 
guages of aboriginal America. Roman 
Catholic ritual seems rich and complex to 
us, but it is a mere bagatelle in comparison 
with the endless elaboration of the ritual 
life of the Pueblo Indians. Northwest 
Coast Indian art is relatively crude in its 
delineation (at its best, superb), but the 
purely formal limitations set on the artist's 
activity would seem to us almost to pre- 
clude the possibility of individual expres- 
sion at all. In lower levels of culture the 
number of things that one must do is 
great; in higher levels the number of 
things one may do is vastly greater, the 
number of things one must do relatively 
less. Progress, if it means anything at all, 
may be ideally defined as the infinite mul- 
tiplication of things one may profitably do, 
think, and enjoy, coupled with the gradual 
elimination of all things one must not do. 

We may seem to have gone very far 
afield, but the truth is that a proper his- 
torical perspective of such a problem as 
that of the use of rhyme can hardly be 
gained on a less broad foundation. The 
historical and psychological considerations 
affecting rhyme are by no means peculiar to 
it, but necessarily apply to countless other 
elements of art and life. Briefly, then, 
aesthetic progress cannot mean that we 
hold on to such a feature as rhyme because 
it is a valuable conquest, a complexity that 
we have achieved in passing from a less to 
a more subtle grasp of form (this </.* 
true in its day) , but that we leave it behind 
as already belonging to a more primitive 
stage of artistic consciousness. Once a re- 
splendent jewel, it is now a pretty bauble. 
In time it will have become an uglv bauble.

Literary Affairs in France 

(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 
Literary France of the twentieth century is 
striving, and striving very successfully in spite 
of the war, to make amends for the crass injustice 
done to the memory of Shakespeare during the 
eighteenth century, under the bigoted (in this 
instance) leadership of Voltaire. A vigorous 
"Societe Shakespeare" was founded this spring 
in Paris, "with the poet acting as the connecting 
link," writes the general secretary, M. Valentin 
Mandelstamm, "between the civilizations of 
England, France and America, where Shakes- 
peare has always been feted" another of the 
many examples of how our entrance into the 
war has associated the United States with the 
liberal countries of Europe. It is even the inten- 
tion of the founders of the new society to 
"establish at Paris a Shakespeare club based on 
the plan of the great clubs of London and New 
York, which will bring together the intellectual 
elite of the three great nations." 

But perhaps a not less interesting feature of 
this present Shakespeare revival in Paris is the 
reminder which it has called forth of an earlier 
and somewhat different effort in the same direc- 
tion. When the new society began to be talked 
about in the public prints, there appeared one 
day in "Le Temps" a letter signed by the 
Duchesse Herminie de Rohan, the poet who is 
associated with so many intellectual activities in 
Paris, M. Georges Lecomte, president of the 
Society of Men of Letters, and M. Acollas de 
Larmandie, which pointed out rather sharply that 
the new organization was rather ungracious, to 
say the least, in making no acknowledgment of 
the work already accomplished by the "Societe 
du Theatre Shakespeare," founded in 1909 by 
M. Camille de Sainte-Croix, who died two years 
ago, and whose aim was much the same as that 
announced, "with a flourish of trumpets," by 
the "Societe Shakespeare." 

The widow of the talented and active Shakes- 
peare translator and impresario, "the faithful 
guardian of his memory," as M. Lecomte 
characterizes Mme. Suzanne Camille de Sainte- 
Croix, who is a sculptor of ability, presents this 
whole matter in these words, which she gave me 
not long ago : 

My husband devoted the energy of his best years, 
his days and nights, his health and his very life, to 
an effort to found in Paris a Shakespeare Theatre 
and to acclimate in France a love for the great 
English poet. In doing this, he encountered all those 
difficulties always met by him who takes the initiative 



in a really disinterested work, and he died at the 
very moment when this preliminary effort accom- 
plished at the cost of much labor was on the point 
of succeeding brilliantly. His task was about to be 
crowned with approval by the transformation of one 
of the largest playhouses in Paris into a Shakespeare 
Theatre. He had arranged a repertory of ten plays, 
with their scenery, stage settings, and costumes ; he 
had trained a troop of young actors; he had selected 
a corps of able translators; had done, in a word, 
everything necessary to produce that unity which 
Shakespeare had in mind when he wrote his plays. 
A prodigy of this sort could have been brought about 
only by a veritable man of letters who was also a 
dramatist. No one who was simply an actor could 
have accomplished this. [The reference here is to 
M. Gemier, the soul of the new Shakespeare Society, 
who recently brought out at Paris "The Merchant 
of Venice," "with some new-fangled ideas."] To 
enter into the spirit of a genius as powerful, as com- 
plex, as varied and as subtle as that of Shakespeare, 
one must be a man of brains who has spent years in 
studying him, in fathoming him, in discovering his 
thought and then properly expressing it, not one who 
is striving after striking effects and stage tricks. But 
in this world persons and things are quickly for- 
gotten. The dead cannot defend themselves. So we 
must speak for them, especially at a moment when 
a Shakespeare Society is being founded on the ideas 
of a grand precursor, such as was Camille de Sainte- 
Croix. 

What M. de Sainte-Croix and M. Firmin 
Gemier have done in the France of to-day for 
the Elizabethan drama, M. Eugene Baie is doing 
for Flanders and the Flemings by the publica- 
tion of his remarkable book, "L'Epopee Fla- 
mande" (Paris: Alcan; 3 fr. 50). It is quite 
impossible in a paragraph or two to give an 
exact and adequate idea of this complex and 
often dreamy volume; and the sub-title, "History 
of Collective Sensibility," supplies but a partial 
and on the whole a rather unsatisfactory descrip- 
tion of its character. If one reads the apprecia- 
tions from a dozen leading European writers and 
critics given on an accompanying sheet sent out 
by the publisher, one is struck by the many- 
sidedness of this book, which does not seem to 
have been translated into English and which 
would be exceedingly difficult to translate if the 
attempt were made to preserve the delicacy and 
elusiveness of style and thought of the original. 
Thus, M. Maurice Barres finds it "one of the 
most nationalistic works of Europe"; Maeter- 
linck declares it to be "one of the most vigorous 
and picturesque books in our language" ; Emile 
Verhaeren said that "though written in prose, 
it is a real lyric, solidly built and violently 
generous" ; Camille Lemonnier held that it is 
"a medullar book, and the author imperious and 
a man of decided convictions" ; while another 
critic compares him to Michelet, a second to 
Taine, and a third to Carlyle. 

And who is this author to whom such great

[August 16 



praise is given? I do not find his name in any 
of the European "Who's Whos." But I know 
him to have been born in 1874, at Malines, the 
city of the beautiful chimes, shamefully destroyed 
by the Germans; and he stands forth to-day one 
of the best known of the Belgian writers of the 
new generation. His first book, at least 1 think 
it was his first, was entitled "Sub Rosa et Sub 
Umbra." It consisted of subtle evocations of 
the life of the ancients and of the Italian 
Renaissance, and its appearance immediately 
attracted the attention of the best of intellectual 
Europe. Then the young author began to be 
active in parliamentary and political circles with- 
out being either a deputy or a politician. Here 
was another reason why eyes were turned toward 
him. His indefatigable efforts to bring about 
a political and economic rapprochement between 
Holland and Belgium caused considerable stir in 
1907. For ten years he was associated with the 
late Auguste Beernaert, the prominent Belgian 
senator, in international affairs, and since the out- 
break of the war, M. Baie has been the soul of 
the International Conference, whose aim is to 
establish an economic solidarity among the 
Allies. He announces for early publication "La 
Legon des Morts," which will continue and 
complete the present volume, telling "what 
strength is hidden in the Flemish temperament 
and what hopes this strength gives rise to." 

The following extract from a letter which M. 
Baie sent me recently from Florence may perhaps 
give the reader some idea of the working of the 
mind of this exceptional man, of the spirit which 
pervades his writings, and of his literary style, 
though, as I have already said, it is not easy to 
reproduce his style in a translation: 

It is difficult to say now what forms of art and 
literature will prevail in Flanders after the war, for 
my poor country is too distracted at present to think 
of such things. Her Muses are Weeping Muses who 
are shedding tears of blood, and if they had a mission 
in keeping with the hour, it would be that of catching 
the echo of those in despair, the cry of the vanquished, 
and then tracing in words, like the imprint on the 
handkerchief of Veronica, the terribly august record 
of the agony of the nation, so that it shall never, 
never be forgotten and the people may take pity upon 
itself. It is not necessary that the things of the 
imagination begin forthwith to flourish once again 
in our land, for each one of us bears a hell in his 
breast; and nothing else can equal that. Our visions 
of this hell are so intense that it would seem that 
thev might break our hearts to the end of eternity. 

But what should flower again without delay for 
the uplift of our dear people who aspire to be reborn 
only through the dignity of labor, is our ancient art 
industries whose invention was the honor of our 
ancestors but which are to-day, at one and the same 
time, a menaced patrimony of humanity and a possible 
instrument of our national regeneration. Lace- 
making, high-warp, iron-work, diamond-cutting all 



the charming masterships and mysteries, to use a Hue 
old word, of my race await the coming of the holy 
ark in order to be reborn to-morrow. Indeed, how 
admirable it would be if the United Stato, \\huli 
bends with such tenderness of soul over our distress, 
should decide to open at Antwerp, after the war, a 
Flemish conservatory of arts and trades, on \\li..-- 
benches places would be reserved for American 
students, thus creating between our two nations a 
bond of union which would be very dear to us. Ami 
how in conformity with the proverbial spirit of 
American generosity would it be to make known this 
idea in your noble country so that this dream of our 
own national redemption might to-morro\v become a 
superb and certain reality. 

Why M. Baie proposes Antwerp as the site 
for such a great school is evident after reading 
the pamphlet, "Le Port d'Anvers" (Paris: Van 
Oest; 25 centimes), by M. Andre Fontainas, the 
Belgian author, wherein is set forth the impor- 
tance of this great port before the war and what 
is hoped for after its restoration at the end of 
the German domination. But perhaps just now 
the best page in this study for Americans to read 
is that devoted to the history of Herr Albert 
von Bary, that typical Teuton in foreign parts, 
who resided at Antwerp thirty years, until he 
became one of the most feted and powerful men 
of affairs in that busy town. "I have tun 
countries," he would say at banquet tables, "Ger- 
many and Belgium." But when at the be^innin^ 
of August, 1914, he saw that Belgium meant to 
fight, he suddenly fled, and then the astonished 
municipal police found in his house a machine- 
gun, a stock of small arms and German officers' 
uniforms, and it became painfully evident that 
this Herr von Bary was simply one of those 
hi";h-class spies which Germany had everywhere 
and which she still has among both enemy and 
neutral nations. 

Here are the closing lines of M. Fontainas's 
admirable little work: 

In the fabulous times of Julius Caesar a horrible 
giant called Druon Antigonus devastated the banks 
of the Scheldt, where he lived by his depredations, 
until the whole region trembled with terror at the 
mere mention of his name. But one dav a rinc young 
fisherman, Salvius Brabo, came boldly forth and 
bravely challenged to battle him whom all so feared. 
The giant, clad in armor, carried a dagger and a 
sword, while the fisher boy was armed <>nlv \\ith a 
clumsy cutlass and bore on his shoulder a coil of 
rope. Supple and quick of movement, he parried the 
heavy blows of his adversary, whose clum-v \i-^ 
finally got tangled in the rope so that he fell to the 
ground, when the boy dashed forward and cut off 
the head and the right hand of the giant. This hand 
he whirled up into the air and with a vigorous effort 
cast into the river, thus performing an act of hand 
li'frfifn, as the Flemish say ; and hence the name of 
the city of Antwerp. So when the hand of this 
monstrous Germania is cut off, Antwerp will again 
have a rebirth, the last let us hope, and will pnper 
once more in a purer and more beautiful glorv than 
ever.

It was, by the way, to a canon of the famous 
cathedral of Antwerp, Laurent Beyerlinck, who 
was also an alumnus of Louvain, that the uni- 
versity of this last city owed the foundation of 
its once celebrated library, utterly destroyed, it 
will be remembered, at the end of August, 1914, 
by the German ruthlessness of which M. Baie 
and M. Fontainas complain. Dr. Leon Van der 
Essen, professor of history at Louvain, gives in 
another pamphlet an account of the rise and 
destruction of these collections. "La Biblio- 
theque de Louvain" (Manchester: John Ry- 
lands Library; Is.) is published in connection 
with the movement in England to reconstitute 
the library of Louvain University. Books for 
this purpose are now being sent to Manchester, 
where the work is being centralized, from all 
parts of the world.

The Later Feminism 



TOWARDS A SANE FEMINISM. By Wilma Meikle. 
(R. M. McBride & Co.; $1.25.) 
MOTHERHOOD. By C. Gascquoine Hartley (Mrs. 
Walter M. Gallichan). (Dodd, Mead & Co.; 

$2.50.) 

If we are to judge from Miss Meikle's bril- 
liant little book, the newer feminism is marked 
by an unwonted kindliness toward men. "As 
fellow-discoverers, equally blundering, equally 
uninstructed, equally suffering," she redeems 
them from that "slashing revenge for the early 
Christian calumnies upon woman" which femin- 
ists like Miss Christabel Pankhurst have so con- 
spicuously wielded. If the predatory and tainted 
male is no longer to be the theme of feminist 
laments, feminism must have ceased to be a cru- 
sade and become a philosophy of life. The 
change is evident in Miss Meikle's iconoclasm. 
Her sharp and witty criticism is directed neither 
against men nor against the unawakened woman, 
but against feminist leaders and types and trends 
themselves. She wants to transcend the past and 
clear the ground for a sounder feminism after the 
war. She is unsparing of the tactics that lead 
women into education and professional studies 
rather than into business and industry.. Her 
argument is that a dependent class must become 
economically influential before it can hope for 
political power. Women in England (she writes 
as an Englishwoman) would long since have had 
the vote if feminist capital and ability had been 
urged to produce woman business and industrial 
leaders instead of political agitators and routine 



cogs in the man-made machine. She would 
sweep away the traditional college training of 
women in cultivated intellectuality, and replace 
it with an education in science and business, pre- 
paring women to take effective leadership in the 
economic reconstruction after the war. 

As to sex problems, Miss Meikle is unsparing 
in her mockery of the English feminists who 
tried to wreck the conventions. She paints satir- 
ically the uneasy and pedantic freedom which 
the experimentalists took for themselves. She 
looks for a healthy "balancing of the fiercest 
claims of the body with the mind's ultimately 
stronger hunger for romance." She has the ad- 
mirable attitude of no longer having to argue 
for freedom but rather to define and clarify it. 
Her very vagueness as to forms is recognition 
of the fact that with freedom personal relations 
may be hoped to adjust themselves. The fam- 
ily's sacredness is undermined by her idea that 
"motherhood is one of the most casual of all 
relations." 

It is to this plausible but shocking idea that 
Mrs. Gallichan takes exception, but she has all 
Miss Meikle's kindliness toward men. She 
even goes so far as to say that "no man leaves 
a woman till she sends him from her." She does 
not see that her thesis that "no ideals have been 
produced by even the most progressive and en- 
lightened persons to replace the family group" 
is not really inconsistent with much greater sex 
and personal freedom. Her language is a little 
old-fashioned in wanting the family "recon- 
structed with all its historic bonds of unity and 
sanctity preserved and yet fitted to meet modern 
needs." She represents the older, motherly fem- 
inism with its rather self-conscious responsibility 
and its weakness in referring to criteria of biolog- 
ical science where only an artistic sense of per- 
sonal relations should rule. Much unity and 
sanctity, the psychologists are discovering, could 
pass from the family without hurting it. Miss 
Meikle would agree with Mrs. Gallichan that 
"the immoral union is the one that results in 
bad and irresponsible parenthood." The latter 
herself scolds the unprogressive woman and ad- 
mits that the mother is often the real enemy in 
the home. Her defect consists in being too abso- 
lute. Surely the family group should be con- 
served where the home means "sympathetic 
relationships of mutual affection." But the 
younger feminists are more realistic in seeing 
that where the family means uncongenial rela- 
tionships that fact should be recognized without 
sentimentality and provided for. Mrs. Gallich-

THE DIAL 



[August 16 



an's book moves too much in the realm of con- 
ventionalized emotions. Yet she is with the 
\ounger feminists in advocating other forms of 
sex-partnership besides marriage. And she is 
firm in her insistence that the State and industry 
regulate women's work to the needs of her phys- 
ical functions. If women are to take their place 
everywhere, as they must after the war, the con- 
ditions of their labor must be revolutionized. 
The newer feminism seems quite willing to admit 
sex-differences and to make the most out of them, 
both for personal values and for the adjustment 
of men's and women's work. The old fierce 
denial of women's sex-disability was a tactic in 
the struggle for equality. The abandonment of 
sex-antagonism and of the denial that women's 
functional differentiations count, indicates that 
this later feminism is so sure of itself that it can 
dispense with these old vital myths. 

Mrs. Gallichan's book will break no bones. 
Its style is verbose, and the scientific chapters 
could have been left for abler hands. She is in- 
teresting, however, as a transition stage from 
the old absolutes to a pragmatic feminism like 
Miss Meikle's. I do not know Miss Meikle's 
background, but her book is immensely capable 
and provocative. It is so novel in its scathing 
wit and its high good humor of irreverence that 
I can imagine it taken with some resentment by 
the more studious American feminists. Fortu- 
nately the discussion is of England, and there is 
admiring comment on women's social and public 
achievements in the United States. This should 
alleviate any smart left by the pugnacious attack 
on the "educated" woman and the experiment- 



alist.

Liberal Germany and the War 

GERMANY: The Next Republic? By Carl W. 
Ackerman. (George H. Doran Co. ; $1.50.) 

Toward the close of this book, Mr. Ackerman 
writes: "The people of the United States are 
better informed about the war as a whole than 
are the people of any European country." This 
may be the case indeed, it would be a pity if it 
were not but yet there is much still to be hoped 
for. When one listens to the absurd statements 
in regard to Germany which are made even by 
educated people, he must wonder what persons 
who were less "well informed" would say. For 
example, probably the worst thing that could 
happen for Germany, for peace, and for democ- 
racy throughout the world would be the death 



of the present Kaiser, leaving tin- down Prince 
in charge of the German Government; \i-t how 
often do we hear from our newspaper^, our 
clergy, our college professors, from all the lead- 
ers of American thought, that if we could onl\ 
get rid of William II, then all the world's 
troubles would disappear overnight! And this 
bit of idiocy is typical. Unprepared for war as 
we were in a military sense, we were even worse 
off in intellectual preparedness. We knew \ery 
little of Germany before the war, and we know 
practically nothing of what has been going on 
in that country since August, 1914. Our con- 
ception of the whole war is confined to some 
trite phrase, such as "democracy against autocra- 
cy" the constant repetition of which will hurt 
nobody so much as ourselves. In view of this 
deplorable situation, it is fortunate that Mr. 
Ackerman has written this book ; it is a book that 
every American, and especially every American 
liberal, should find of the greatest value. 

Mr. Ackerman was the representative of the 
United Press in Germany from March, 1915 
(shortly after the submarine campaign was tir>r 
started) until the spring of this year, when he 
left in company with Ambassador Gerard. Dur- 
ing those two years he naturally acquired a 
wide knowledge of conditions in Germany and 
Austria, while no less a person than our Am- 
bassador has said that he was "one of the two 
American correspondents whose dispatches re- 
mained uncolored by German prejudice." But 
though he remained unprejudiced in their favor, 
Mr. Ackerman was not unsympathetic with the 
German people, and particularly with their striv- 
ings toward liberalism. What he has to say of 
the Germany democracy is therefore worth) of 
the most careful attention. The present book 
is his account, somewhat journalistic in its char- 
acter, but apparently careful and accurate, of 
the liberal forces in Germany as he observed 
them. 

At the very beginning of the war, we are 
told, there was a great struggle in Germany be- 
tween the liberals and the militarists. While 
members of the latter party, which included \.n 
Moltke, von Tirpitz, von Falkenhaxn. the 
Krupps, and the Rhine Valley industrial leaders, 
were clamoring for war and an immediate in\ a- 
sion of Belgium, the liberals, under the leadership 
of von Bethmann-Hollweg, were urging the 
Kaiser to heed the proposals of Sir Edward (Irc\ 
for a Peace Conference. Mobilization was thus 
delayed for three days. For this. Hethmann- 
Hollweg never has been, and never will be. for-

given by the military authorities. "This internal 
fight became Germany's bitterest struggle #nd 
from time to time the odds went from one side 
to another. The army accused the diplomats of 
blundering in starting the war. The Foreign 
Office replied that it was the lust for power and 
victory which poisoned the military leaders that 
had caused the war." Belgium was invaded against 
the counsel of the Foreign Office. The Allies 
have said little about this crime which the Ger- 
man liberals, particularly the Socialists, did not 
say at first, but the force of circumstances com- 
pelled them to acquiesce. Internal dissension 
therefore existed in Germany from the very be- 
ginning of the war. 

As time went on, a number of events, includ- 
ing the battle of the Marne and the destruction 
of German commerce, conspired to strengthen 
the hands of the military party. But not the 
least of these aids to militarism was the oft-re- 
peated epithet of "Huns and Barbarians" which 
their enemies applied to them. This cut the 
Germans to the quick; it hurt them worse than 
any military defeat could have done, and drove 
them into frenzy. They replied to it with the 
cry "Gott strafe England" ; so when von Tirpitz 
announced the submarine campaign, it met a 
popular demand. This campaign went on until 
the Lusitania was sunk, and President Wilson 
began sending his notes to Germany. 

The public discussion which resulted [from these 
notes] was greater than that which followed the first 
declarations of war in August 1914. The people, who 
before had accepted everything their Government 
said, began to think for themselves. One heard al- 
most as much criticism as praise for the Lusitania 
incident. For the first time the quarrel, which had 
been nourished between the Foreign Office and the 
Admiralty, became nation-wide and forces through- 
out Germany lined up with one side or the other. 

The liberals were not able to stop the submarine 
campaign at once, however, and presently the 
Arabic was sunk and the Sussex torpedoed. As 
a result of these crises, the matter was laid 
before the Kaiser himself, who decided in favor 
of Bethmann-Hollweg and the liberals. Von 
Tirpitz and von Falkenhayn had to go: the 
liberal forces were now in control. "Washing- 
ton for the first time began to see that eleven 
months of patience was bearing fruit." 

During the "period of new orientation" which 
followed, the reactionary forces were not idle, 
however. The hate campaign against America, 
which had been started soon after the Lusitania 
affair, was redoubled. President Wilson was 
singled out for especial attack; it was said that 
we never had been really neutral ; the German 



people were prepared for war with America. Re- 
peated attempts were also made by the militar- 
ists to oust the Chancellor, but in vain. During 
this period, too, the economic conditions in 
Germany became steadily worse. People be- 
gan to be dissatisfied with the course of the war. 
At length the liberals, led by the Socialists, com- 
pelled the Chancellor to make his celebrated 
peace proposals of December 12. In due time 
the Allies sent their reply, with its impossible 
terms. This finally threw the whole people over 
into the arms of the militarists. 

Nothing which had happened during the year so 
solidified the German nation as the Allies' replies 
to Berlin and President Wilson. It proved to the 
German people that their government was waging a 
defensive war because the Allies demanded annexa- 
tion, compensation and guarantees, all of which 
meant a change in the map of Europe from what 
it was at the beginning of the war. The interests 
which had been demanding a submarine campaign 
saw that their opportunity had come. They knew 
that as a result of the Allies' notes the public would 
sanction an unrestricted sea warfare against the 
whole world if that was necessary. 

Even after this, Ambassador Gerard made 
strenuous efforts to prevent the impending vic- 
tory of the militarists. But it was then too late : 
the die was cast. The people were ready to 
accept the motto Lieber ein Ende mit Schrecken 
ah ein Schrecken ohne Ende (better an end with 
terror than a terror without end). On Janu- 
ary 30, the German government announced the 
resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare. 
A few days later, America broke off diplomatic 
relations, and subsequently declared war. 

Such is a summary of Mr. Ackerman's account 
of the struggle between the two factions in the 
German Empire. Every page of it must give 
food for thought to every American liberal. 
More clearly than anything that has yet ap- 
peared in this country, it tells us what the lib- 
eral forces in Germany are. Though these 
forces are now in defeat, they must still continue 
to exist, and we are here given more than one 
valuable hint as to how we may best cooperate 
with them. 

In many passages the author bears eloquent 
testimony as to the aid which these liberals have 
already derived from America, and particularly 
from President Wilson's notes. "I believe," he 
writes, "that the United States, by two years 
of patience and note-writing, has done more to 
accomplish the destruction of militarism and to 
encourage freedom of thought in Germany than 
the Allies did during nearly three years of fight- 
ing. The United States helped the German 
people think for themselves." The American 



106 



THE DIAL 



[August 16 



notes were therefore most effective in aiding the 
victory of the liberals and the dismissal of von 
Tirpitz, but it is a pity that the American gov- 
ernment did nothing to cooperate with them 
when they were in power. Though Mr. Acker- 
man does not say it expressly, he makes it 
abundantly clear that at every point the United 
States then did exactly what the most reactionary 
forces in Germany hoped and prayed that it 
would do. During the period of liberal ascend- 
ancy, the United States did nothing to make 
England stop interfering with the mail: the 
author says that the Admiralty prevented his pub- 
lishing what few things he did manage to get, 
so that they might complain that all news be- 
tween the two countries had to go by London. 
In notes to Great Britain, the United States had 
characterized the British blockade as "illegal and 
indefensible," but nothing was done to break it; 
the German reactionaries blocked all Ambassador 
Gerard's efforts to get out some dye-stuffs, that 
they might cry the louder to Heaven against 
"British piracy." Mr. Ackerman quotes one of 
the leading German militarists as saying that if 
America would only declare war, "everybody in 
the German navy would throw his hat into the 
air." But what we might have done is a use- 
less question. We must rather ask how we can 
most effectively aid the German liberals now. 

On this point, Mr. Ackerman seems to be 
inconsistent with himself. Though having said 
repeatedly that nothing strengthened the German 
militarists so much as the Allies' talk about a 
"crushing defeat," he now says the same thing 
himself in the hope of throwing the people over 
into the hands of the liberals! It may be that if 
the present militarists are "defeated and discred- 
ited," as he urges, the people will then establish 
a democratic government and live peacefully ever 
after; but it is hard to think of another case in 
history where a military defeat has had such 
effects. A more probable result would be that 
which followed the battle of Jena. Germans 
would spend their money for military prepared- 
ness more gladly than ever, for they would then 
have a legacy of hatred greater than that left 
by Louis XIV and Napoleon. The present mil- 
itary leaders might be "discredited," but more 
efficient ones would be sought. Liberalism would 
be permanently banished for having betrayed the 
Fatherland in its supreme hour of need. 

Moreover, we must now see clearly the sui- 
cidal nature of an unrestrained and undiscrim- 
inating vituperation of all Germans. Not only 
is it true that "you can damn a German until 



you are blue in the face, but that will not beat 
the^m," but this very act of damning makes it 
the harder to defeat them. Mr. Ackerman says 
explicitly that the Allies' cry of "Huns and Bar- 
barians" helped materially in making the Ger- 
mans accept the original submarine warfare and 
the destruction of the Lusitania. It is equally 
clear that the only way to put an end to Prus- 
sianism is to cooperate with the many persons 
in Germany who are even more anxious than 
we to see its finish. 

So all in all, it seems that the most effective- 
enemy of democracy in the world to-day is the 
American "patriot" who loudly hopes that an 
American army will soon set foot in Germany. 
Like the Paris conference on a "war after the 
war," and the Allies' peace terms, such persons 
are a veritable God-send to the Prussian mili- 
tarists. And not only do they force the German 
liberals into the arms of the militarists, but the 
two British failures on the Somme show con- 
clusively that such an event would require a mil- 
itary machine on our part of such gigantic pro- 
portions that it would crush out whatever 
democracy we have in our own country. We 
might better devote our energies to persuading 
our allies to renounce certain of their exagger- 
ated ambitions in which our entrance into the 
war has so far apparently encouraged them. If 
the United States should accept the Russian 
formula of "no annexations, no indemnities," it 
would be a more severe blow to Prussianism 
than would be the annihilation of several army 
corps: it would be a blow directly at the mili- 
tarists, and not at the unfortunate "German 
people" who compose the army corps, and for 
whom we profess only friendship. Let us hope 
that President Wilson still holds to his lofty 
ideal of a "peace without victory."

Samuel Butler somewhere suggests (I believe 
it is in his "Alps and Sanctuaries") that no less 
interesting and important than Locke's fammi* 
"Essay Concerning the Human Understanding" 
would be an Essay Concerning the Human Mis- 
understanding. We do not sufficiently realize, he 
remarks, the part which illusion has played in our 
development. How different would life be but for

the ability to do as the poor Ticinese woman did 
who, transplanted from Ticino to London, was 
found kneeling in prayer before a dentist's show- 
case in Hampstead Road, mistaking the show- 
case for a roadside oratory and the artificial 
teeth for the relics of a saint. The power of 
adaptation to varying circumstances is a prime 
requisite for evolution, physical and mental, and 
the power of adaptation is mainly dependent 
upon the capacity of thinking certain new things 
sufficiently like others to which we have been 
accustomed for us not to be so much incommoded 
that habitual response becomes impossible. The 
power to take things in such manner that a 
modified habit and eventually a new structure 
becomes possible is the power to mistake them; 
as the power to fuse ideas in a process of thought 
is the power to confuse them. 

So Butler. To stop here, however, would be 
to treat of but one aspect of the human misun- 
derstanding. Progress has depended not only 
upon the ability to mistake a new object for an 
old one, but also upon the ability to see an old 
object in a new light. It was important for the 
Ticinese woman to mistake teeth for the relics of 
a saint, but it was important for Luther to mis- 
take the relics of a saint for teeth. And accord- 
ing to the psychologists, the essential difference 
between the human and the animal intelligence 
is just this ability to recognize and deal with new 
aspects in old situations. 

In their superficial manifestation there is this 
difference between the two types of misunder- 
standing: it is the most common thing in the 
world to accept a new object, providing only it 
is not too new, as a repetition of the object it 
resembles, while it is a most rare thing to see 
anything novel about an object that is well 
known. But more profoundly considered both 
processes are equally unusual. In the one case 
as in the other the native dulness of mortals 
justifies Isaiah's complaint, "They see many 
things, but do not observe; their ears are open, 
but they hear not." Only the very exceptional 
mind perceives, in any comprehensive sense, the 
strange as if it were familiar or the familiar as 
if it were strange. So it takes a Franklin to see 
a storm cloud as a Leyden jar, and a Watts to 
discover a steam engine in a teakettle; while a 
folk-song waits to be heard as a symphony until 
the coming of a Beethoven. And for the very 
good reason that mistaking the new for the old 
or the old for the new constitutes not two unique 
processes, each working after its own fashion, 
but one process facing in two directions. To 



think of the moon as an object swinging in a 
circle at the end of a string is not different in 
principle from thinking of an object so swinging 
as a moon. Each is misunderstanding "in the 
grand style." An Essay Concerning the Human 
Misunderstanding might therefore comprise two 
volumes, after the manner of Locke's work 
one, let us say, on Simple Misunderstanding, and 
the other on Misunderstanding Extraordinary. 

Butler did more, however, than suggest a 
title and offer a few hints to the possible author 
of sugh a work. In a sense he was forever writ- 
ing chapters of the book. Butler's life was one 
long essay in misunderstanding (in the present 
sense) and all his books bear testimony to the 
fact. It used to be a boyhood stunt to stand on 
your hands and see the world upside down. 
Butler knew the trick well and did a deal of 
walking on his hands through our world of 
conventions, intellectual, moral, aesthetic, and 
religious. His books are integrated visions of the 
world thus viewed "The Way of All Flesh," 
of marriage and the family; "Erewhon," of the 
daily life of the English-speaking world; "Life 
and Habit" and "Evolution, Old and New," of 
Darwinism; "The Fair Haven," of Christianity. 
But he came very far from compiling into reports 
all he saw. "One's thoughts fly so fast," he 
said, "that one must shoot them: it is no use 
trying to put salt on their tails." The "Note- 
Books" are a museum of thoughts thus caught 
on the wing, singly or in flocks. One cannot 
promise that the visitor, whoever he be, will find 
the exhibit to his liking. On the contrary, few 
will agree entirely with the curator's sense of 
values, and many will deeply resent the low esti- 
mate placed upon common favorites. One may, 
however, safely assure all comers of the com- 
plete absence of anything cheap, commonplace, or 
artificial. 

But to let go of this figure before it goes too 
far, and to return to the "Note-Books" as a 
record of extraordinary ability in seeing and 
thinking contrary to conventional models, I may 
as well admit, first as last, that I believe it im- 
possible to convey in a review a fair idea of so 
remarkable a book. How shall one carry over 
its freshness, its humor, its honesty, its kindliness, 
its independence? And the versatility of the 
man! Biology, painting, metaphysics, music, re- 
ligion, politics, poetry, morality, but why go 
on ? and always an idea, not a phrase ; always a 
voice, not an echo. Theoretically it is really im- 
possible that one man should be the author of 
such a book. That one man was, is only another

instance of life's disdain of logic. And hmv 
transmit the flavor of such tales as "Homer's 
Hot and Cold Springs"? I give it up. Let 
the reader be content or, rather, let him be dis- 
content with a few citations and straightway go 
to the book itself. 

Compare the cant and affectation of the re- 
ligious idiom we are taught from our youth with 
the freshness and naturalness of Butler. His 
note headed "God and the Devil" may serve as 
an example: 

God's merits are so transcendent that it is not sur- 
prising his faults should be in reasonable proportion. 
The faults are, indeed, on such a scale that, when 
looked at without relation to the merits with which 
they are interwoven, they become so appalling that 
people shrink from ascribing them to the Deity and 
have invented the Devil, without seeing that there 
would be more excuse for God's killing the Devil, 
and so getting rid of evil, than there can be for his 
failing to be everything that he would like to be. 

For God is not so white as he is painted, and he 
gets on better with the Devil than people think. The 
Devil is too useful for him to wish him ill and, in 
like manner, half the Devil's trade would be at an 
end should any great mishap bring God well down 
in the world. For all the mouths they make at one 
another they play into each other's hands and have got 
on so well as partners, playing Splenlow and Jor- 
kins to one another, for so many years that there 
seems no reason why they should cease to do so. 

Nor was Butler's heresy due, as is often the 
case, to spiritual poverty. It was exactly the 
profundity of his spiritual convictions that mo- 
tivated his disdain of the conventional religionists. 
What better expression of the religious attitude 
can be given than is found in his paragraph on 
"Blasphemy"? He writes: 

I begin to understand now what Christ meant when 
he said that blasphemy against the Holy Ghost was 
unforgivable, while speaking against the Son of Man 
might be forgiven. He must have meant that a man 
may be pardoned for being unable to believe in the 
Christian mythology, but that if he made light of that 
spirit which the common conscience of all men, what- 
ever their particular creed, recognizes as divine, there 
was no hope for him. No more there is. 

The same frankness characterizes Butler's ut- 
terances on the relation of parent and child. His 
philosophy, voiced in "The Way of All Flesh," 
is there summed up in a remark by the way: 

Why should the generations overlap one another at 
all? Why cannot we be buried as eggs in neat little 
cells with ten or twenty thousand pounds each 
wrapped round us in Bank of England notes, and 
wake up, as the sphex wasp does, to find that its papa 
and mamma have not only left ample provisions at its 
elbow, but have been eaten by sparrows some weeks 
before it began to live consciously on its own account. 

This is a hard doctrine for most of us, trained 
as we are to accept the divine right of parents, 
and ever ready to sacrifice the ideals of youth 



to save the interests of age. It is, however, a 
central doctrine in Butler's view of life. Rub 
him am u here and you soon lay bare the con- 
viction that much of human misery and failure 
is directly traceable to the family. "I believe," 
he says in the "Note-Book," "that more unhappi- 
ness comes from this source than from any other 
I mean from the attempt to prolong family 
connection unduly and to make people hang to- 
gether artificially who would never naturally 
do so. The mischief among the lower classes 
is not so great, but among the middle and upper 
classes it is killing a large number daily." 

That his attitude on family ties is, again, not 
due to poverty of feeling is clear from the char- 
acteristic note which appears in the chapter on 
"The Life of the World to Come." 

I have often told my son that he must begin by 
finding me a wife to become his mother who shall 
satisfy both himself and me. But this is only one of 
the many rocks on which we have hitherto split. We 
should never have got on together; I should have had 
to cut him off with a shilling either for laughing at 
Homer, or for refusing to laugh at him, or both, or 
neither, but still cut him off. So I settled the matter 
long ago by turning a deaf ear to his importunities 
and sticking to it that 1 would not get him at all. 
Vet his thin ghost visits me at times and, though he 
knows that it is no use pestering me further, he looks 
at me so wistfully and reproachfully that I am half- 
inclined to turn tail, take my chance about his mother 
and ask him to let me get him after all. But I should 
show a clean pair of heels if he said "Yes." 

Besides he would probably be a girl. 

But it was rash to venture upon quotation. 
And now in profusion I give that up too. For 
what should one select from chapters of notes 
on "Truth and Convenience," "A Painter's 
Views on Painting," "Written Sketches," "Han- 
del and Music," "Higgledy-Piggledy," and 
twenty others? Why, there are books in the 
fifteenth chapter alone, where Butler's unused 
titles and subjects are collected. Consider, for 
instance, the possibilities of "The Diseases and 
Ordinary Causes of Mortality among Friend- 
ships." And I know of nothing written on 
painting so intimate as chapter nine. It is paint- 
ing become articulate in speech. One appears 
to be in the very midst of the process, one smells 
the oils, one sees the colors laid on, one invol- 
untarily avoids coming into contact with the fresh 
paint. And there are the notes on music and 
on the master whom Butler worshiped from his 
twelfth year onward, and who inspired his coin- 
positions. "Handel is so great and so simple that 
no one but a professional musician is unable to 



1917] 



THE DIAL

understand him." It is fitting that the last thing 
in the "Note-Books" should be one of the son- 
nets on Handel: 

Father of my poor music if such small 
Offspring as mine, so born out of due time, 
So scorn'd, can be called fatherful at all, 
Or dare to thy high sonship's rank to climb 
Best lov'd of all the dead whom I love best, 
Though I love many another dearly too, 
You in my heart take rank above the rest; 
King of those kings that most control me, you, 
You were about my path, about my bed 
In boyhood always and, where'er I be, 
Whate'er I think or do, you, in my head, 
Ground-bass to all my thoughts, are still with me; 
Methinks the very worms will find some strain 
Of yours still lingering in my wasted brain. 

There are people no doubt who could read 
Butler and remain unimpressed, for there is 
absolutely no display of erudition in his work. 
There are others, I suppose, who could read him 
with interest and get away untouched, for some 
intellects are Leibnizian monads, having no win- 
dows. To thinking men and women, however, 
providing they are not too old in spirit, Butler 
speaks with vital directness. Not that he formu- 
lates a philosophy or solves problems or teems 
with information. Exactly not that. In read- 
ing Butler one's growth is not by apposition but 
by intussusception. One does not accumulate; 
one expands. One does not become a little But- 
ler but a larger self. That is why if one had 
to choose between going to Butler and going to 
college, one might do worse for one's soul than 
choose the less expensive course. For Butler 
has a way of decreasing that the reader may in- 
crease. He is not anxious for his standing, what 
position he shall hold, what honors he shall re- 
ceive, what reputation he shall acquire. And be- 
cause he prefers to determine what he shall be 
interested in rather than take his cue from the 
authorities; because he insists upon seeing clearly 
and for himself, in spite of religious and scien- 
tific orthodoxy; because he strives to voice his 
views naturally and honestly, even if this entails 
serious losses; finally, because he speaks out of 
contact with life and with creative activity 
rather than out of an artificial academic at- 
mosphere, acquaintance with Butler means spir- 
itual regeneration. The "Note-Books" especially 
would do admirably for a radical's book of devo- 
tions. A paragraph read of a morning as a 
basis for meditation, and a larger portion in the 
same spirit for Sundays, may therefore be recom- 
mended to socialists and others who look forward 



to a different social state. While the suggestion 
of "family prayers" with passages from the 
"Note-Books" as scripture readings, would doubt- 
less have appealed to Butler's sense of humor, 
the scheme is so contrary to his spontaneous spirit 
that one must apologize for even having thought 
of it in connection with him. And what I meant 
to say was after all that the book is delightful 
and stimulating, whether read in snatches or in 
continuity, and that it wears well. 

What can be done by certain vested interests 
to damn an original author is illustrated by But- 
ler. In the analysis of the sales of his books one 
discovers that from only one of them, "Ere- 
whon," did he have any financial profit. The 
reason for this lack of popularity may be given 
in Butler's own words: 

I should have liked notoriety and financial success 
well enough if they could have been had for the ask- 
ing, but I was not going to take any trouble about 
them and, as a natural consequence, I did not get 
them. If I had wanted them with the same passion- 
ate longing that has led me to pursue every inquiry 
that I have ever pursued, I should have got them 
fast enough. . . . 

One reason, and that the chief, why I have made no 
noise, is now explained. It remains to add that from 
first to last I have been unorthodox and militant in 
every book that I have written. I made enemies of 
the parsons once for all with my first two books. 
["Erewhon" and "The Fair Haven."] The evolution 
books made the Darwinians, and through them the 
scientific world in general, even more angry than 
"The Fair Haven" had made the clergy so that I 
had no friends, for the clerical and scientific people 
rule the roost between them. 

I have chosen the fighting road rather than the 
hang-on-to-a-great-man road, and what can a man 
who does this look for except that people should try 
to silence him in whatever way they think will be 
most effectual ? . . . 

"Ages, like rulers," Kuno Fischer once said, 
"have a way of withholding audience to those 
who would speak to them until it suits their 
convenience to listen." Butler's turn has come. 
He is being heard, and he will be heard more. 
And as he is understood, his voice will join those 
others which to-day are challenging the vested 
interests church, college, state interests which 
combined in his day and combine in ours to 
silence all heralds of a new order. Reading 
Butler should be an encouragement to all who 
are struggling to maintain their moral and in- 
tellectual integrity in the midst of widespread 
insanity. If, however, I were running the uni- 
verse, Butler would have been introduced to 
our age not by Bernard Shaw but by William 
James. M. C. OTTO.

The Scammon Lectures 

Six LECTURES ON ARCHITECTURE. By Ralph 
Adams Cram, Thomas Hastings, and Claude 
Bragdon. The Scammon Lectures for 191 5. 
(Published for the Art Institute of Chicago by 
the University of Chicago Press; $2.) 

To trace the history of Gothic architecture in 
the course of two lectures, would be no small 
undertaking, even were one to confine himself 
to the simplest, most straightforward account of 
the rise of the style and its subsequent develop- 
ment. But, nothing daunted, Mr. Ralph Adams 
Cram, who believes that, "to understand a style, 
it is necessary to do more than scrutinize its 
material elements, determining by scientific meth- 
ods its line of stylistic descent and the peculiar- 
ities of its organic mechanism," sets out, in 
precisely that space, to interpret the spirit as well 
as the form of the supreme architecture of the 
Middle Ages, and to relate this, however sum- 
marily, to the entire social, political, cultural, 
and spiritual life of the period. 

Needless to say, the results are somewhat 
sketchy. To accomplish his purpose he prac- 
tises startling retrecissements of architectural 
history and summarizes the evolution of the 
characteristic features of Gothic construction 
ribbed vault, domed vault, compound pier, archi- 
volt, flying buttress, pointed arch, and so forth 
in paragraphs bristling with names, dates, and 
technical terms. The effect is sufficiently cryp- 
tic even on the printed page, and one can only 
imagine the impression that must have been 
produced upon Mr. Cram's hearers mainly in- 
telligent laymen, no doubt by such a passage as 
that dealing with the development of the chevet, 
for example, from the Syrian builders of the 
dioceses of Damascus and Antioch, to those who 
completed the process in the great churches of 
Rheims, Bourges, Chartres, and Westminster, 
or by such a bit of engineering jargon as the fol- 
lowing: 

Between the two types we are considering, the ques- 
tion was live load versus dead loads. The basilica 
was inactive; its small nave arches had little thrust 
and its apse semi-dome also; the great triumphal 
arch to the choir was the only thing that was se- 
riously active. 

Yet the treatment, on the whole, is stimulat- 
ing and suggestive. No one in the world to-day 
certainly not in this country is, perhaps, bet- 
ter qualified than Mr. Cram to interpret the 
Gothic spirit, not only in architecture and the 
allied arts, which, as he says, make a single syn- 
thesis with it, but in all that pertains to the 
culture and civilization of the Middle Ages. 



We (inly wish he might have had a somewhat 
broader canvas on which to project his picture, 
and find it hard to understand why he should 
not have been invited to deliver the entire course 
of Scammon lectures for 1915, instead of only 
a third of it. 

Mr. Thomas Hastings was doubtless chosen 
as a representative of the Renaissance, to balance 
Mr. Cram as champion of the Gothic. It can 
hardly be said, however, that he presents a very 
strong brief for his cause. For if it be true, 
as Mr. Hastings premises, that "style in its 
growth has always been governed by the univer- 
sal and eternal law of development" something 
which is entirely untrue in any absolute sense 
then he has already pronounced the harshest 
possible judgment upon Renaissance architec- 
ture, which is the most striking violation of the 
above rule the history of art has to offer. In- 
stead of being, as implied, a continuous growth 
or evolution from Gothic architecture, as the 
Gothic itself actually was from the Roman, 
through the Romanesque, the new style, born 
overnight in a renewed perception of the beauty 
and grandeur of the antique world, was a total 
denial and repudiation of the old a break with 
the immediate past as radical and abrupt as that 
return to the Gothic which Mr. Hastings so de- 
plores in the early Victorian era and in our 
own day. 

Moreover, far from appearing in response "to 
the needs of a new civilization," as he seems to 
think, Renaissance architecture was, itself, one 
of the most potent factors in creating this civili- 
zation, which, in certain material aspects at all 
events, was markedly inferior to its predecessor. 
One of Mr. Hastings's questionable dicta is that, 
"in order to build a living architecture, we must 
build as we live." But it is a fact that the men 
of the Renaissance, intent only on reviving the 
classic splendor, lived rather as they built, and 
thus lived very badly indeed for several genera- 
tions, as compared with their medieval ancestors, 
the practical conveniences of whose castles, as 
Mrs. Putnam has shown in her delightful book 
on "The Lady," greatly surpassed those of the 
Renaissance palazzo. 

All this, of course, is not to say that the 
Renaissance is not justified as a great historic 
school of architecture, but simply that Mr. Hast- 
ings has not chosen the right way to justify it. 
The confusion in his thought seems to an\e from 
a certain conflict between his training and his 
practical aptitudes. Recognizing implicitly but 
one mode of architecture the "organic," as .Mr. 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



in 



Claude Bragdon calls it he is obliged to con- 
tend that the Renaissance is no less structural 
and developmental in its origin than the Gothic, 
or else completely throw over the school in which 
he received his education. Mr. Bragdon, it 
seems to us, comes much closer to the truth in 
his first lecture the fifth in the volume where 
he recognizes two distinct architectural modes, 
instead of one only. 

"When we come to consider architecture 
throughout the world and down the ages," he 
writes, continuing a contrast between nature and 
man's work, or art, "we find it bisected by a 
like inevitable duality: either it is organic, fol- 
lowing the law of nature again; or it is ar- 
ranged, according to some Euclidian ideal 
devised by proud-spirited man. In other words, 
it is either cultivated, like the flower; or it is 
cut, like the gem." 

The Renaissance, which is the type of the 
latter, has, therefore, its place in the psychologic 
order no less than the Gothic, which is the type 
of the former, though on a distinctly lower level 
from the standpoint of creative art. And choice 
between them, or the tendencies which they rep- 
resent, will always be primarily one of funda- 
mental taste or mental constitution.

The Collectivist Advance 



STATE SOCIALISM PRO AND CON. Edited by Wil- 
liam English Walling and Harry M. Laidler. 
(Henry Holt & Co.; $2.) 

To seasoned travellers or advanced students 
of the socialist state Messrs. Walling and Laidler 
have furnished a "handy guide" in "State So- 
cialism Pro and Con." The major part of this 
work, over six hundred pages, consists of "offi- 
cial documents and other authoritative selections 
showing the world-wide replacement of private 
by governmental industry before and during the 
war." The relation of these documents to the 
editors' theme is presented in an admirable in- 
troduction wherein attempt is made to prevent 
confused thinking through confusion of terms. 

The nicety of phrasing in this introduction 
gives fair warning to mere sightseers that there 
will be little excitement for them in the suc- 
ceeding pages. The tired business man and the 
culture club sociologist will not find those pal- 
atably inaccurate generalizations with which to 
impress a dinner partner. There are no daylight 
criticisms of contemporary folly or moonlit 



prophecies of future wisdom. In truth the edi- 
tors hold themselves ostentatiously aloof from 
their production. This is not a brief for state 
socialism, they announce. "Our object has been 
rather to provide the reader with the most im- 
portant data, so that he may be equally free to 
reach a conclusion for or against collectivism." 

There is however a false suggestion in this 
object, as stated, because of the implication that 
arguments for or against collectivism are inher- 
ent in the compiled documents. Yet the selec- 
tions that follow are not records of the success 
or failure of collectivism but exhibit largely the 
form and extent of state operation of industry, 
with little data upon which the interested reader 
may base an approving or disapproving judg- 
ment. 

One may be inclined to feel that in so vital a 
controversy as the present world conflict be- 
tween receding individualism and oncoming col- 
lectivism such an array of statistical information 
should be humanized by intermittent emotional 
outbursts. Finance, Agriculture, Transportation, 
and Commerce are paraded before the reader 
under the flags of all nations; but there are no 
brass bands. Rank upon rank pass in review: 
Central Banks and methods of control in the 
United States, Great Britain, Germany, Russia, 
Hungary, Japan, New Zealand, and Australia. 
Postal Savings Banks, showing increases in num- 
ber of depositors, size of average deposit, and 
amounts of total deposits. Land Reclamation 
and Development, with total cost and acreage. 
Forestry, Roads, Fisheries, Water Power, Canals, 
Shipping, Railways, Telegraphs, and Telephones. 
The monotonous columns of legislative and ad- 
ministrative product seem as endless and all-con- 
quering as the German horde pouring into North- 
ern France. 

There is something in the extent and power 
of these mobilized statistics that demands an emo- 
tional reaction even from a neutral. Is collectiv- 
ism marching to a world triumph or to a world 
defeat? Will it capture Paris, or almost reach 
its goal and then, retreating sullenly, dig itself 
into hostile soil and hold for decades even cen- 
turies the ground won in the first rush of a 
world war? 

It is no criticism of the editors of "State So- 
cialism Pro and Con" that they do not even 
attempt to answer these questions. It is rather 
the most sincere compliment that their "source 
book" is so impressive in its array of facts and 
figures that it stirs deeper curiosity. One feels 
that the editors themselves must have a Conclu- 



112

sion as well as an Introduction to their com- 
pilation. Of course a Conclusion on so vast a 
subject would be full of half-baked, Utopian, 
illogical, and unwarranted ideas, and therefore a 
choice subject for critical review. It is truly un- 
gracious for the editors of the present volume to 
exercise such restraint of personal opinion as to 
give no opportunity for the reviewer to be clever 
at their expense. He is forced to acknowledge 
that within the self-imposed limits of their work 
they have succeeded in presenting a unique and 
adequate record of the world-advance of col- 
lectivism. 

A chapter on "Municipal Ownership," edited 
by Mr. Evans Clark, surveys that field briefly, 
effectively, and with consistent impersonality. 

"State Socialism Pro and Con" is not recom- 
mended for hammock hours. But as a handy 
reference volume for the serious-minded it will 
save many days of searching through technical 
libraries for data on collectivism.

Mrs. Austin says in "The Ford": "Some- 
body who has the interest of the feminist move- 
ment at heart ought to think out a formula by 
which an earnest young man can readily convey 
to an equally earnest young woman that, while 
he knows, of course, that she means absolutely 
everything she says, he knows at the same time 
that she doesn't mean anything. . . it 
must be a situation frequently cropping up in 
these days when young women are nothing if 
not earnest." Most of the young women in the 
novels here commented on are dead in earnest, 
live in earnest; and the authors, except one, are 
intently serious. In spite of an estival desire to 
escape responsible thinking, I rind their serious- 
ness commendable, strongly enough supported on 
narrative structure and sufficiently mitigated by 
humor to amuse me in a hammock or console 
me when one sheet is too heavy to sleep under. 



We cannot escape the problems ot labor and 
capital or the problems of the feminine, eternal 
or transitory, and the pleasantry \v:u to put in 
some sort of order the part of your mind which 
is occupied by these problems is to watch the 
novelists play with them. And if the players 
are intently sober, the play is not on that 
account less delightful to the onlooker. 

Mrs. Austin is a practised, dexterous pla\er. 
Sometimes consciousness of her dexterity leads 
her into over-elaborated phrasing; you become 
so interested in watching her juggle her racket 
that you forget to see where the ball goes. But 
most of her strokes are swift and sure. She is a 
wise woman with an affectionate understanding 
of young people, and a gently satirical sense of 
their follies. The characterization of Virginia, 
the vague and restless radical, is excellent. Any 
veteran Socialist will recognize his younger com- 
rades (but not himself, of course) in Virginia 
and her friends who bandy half-understood 
catch-words. The great social and commercial 
plot behind these children is strongly handled 
and conveys more than any other American fic- 
tion since Frank Norris of what Mrs. Austin 
calls the "epic quality of the west." For one 
thing I am deeply grateful: Mrs. Austin does 
not try to settle the strife between the capitalist 
"interests" and the agrarian "interests" by 
marrying the children of the contesting parties 

Such an obvious solution seems to me to spoil 
the reality of two of our novels. In "Gold 
Must Be Tried by Fire" Mr. Richard Aumerle 
Maher marries his attractive working girl to 
the son of the mill-owner. As the publishers 
say, this does "bring the volume to a pleasing 
close," but I have a feeling that things do not 
happen so. The real strength of the novel is 
the dramatic picture of the industrial wars, the 
war between the workmen and the owners, and 
the war between the independent mill and the 
trust. Those wars which are going on all the 
time, are second in interest only to the military 
war, and in the long run are not second to it 
in importance. It is a fact in life (and there- 
fore a proper theme in fiction) that against the 
immense background of industrial and military 
contest lovers plav their individual comedies and 
tragedies. But in the tumult wedding hells 
make but a thin tinkling music, and a kiss is a 
minor episode, not a climax. The marriage of 
the mill girl does not thrill me, but the tire that 
tried her is real fire. 

In "The Straight Road." an anommous 
novel, the heroine becomes a hop-picker on a

rancn belonging to her lovers father. Here 
again the solution is too easy. Montague and 
Capulet may marry and by young love and young 
death heal the breach between the families; they 
live in the same society and their encounter is 
plausible. But to marry an 1. W. W. striker 
to a son of plutocracy and to bring it about that 
this particular striker should happen to go to 
the particular hop field owned by the cruel 
aristocrat who had separated the girl from his 
son, well, that is asking too much of the most 
acquiescent credulity. And the unlikelihood is 
not lessened by the fact that the girl is not of 
the working class but a gentlewoman in reduced 
circumstances, and the fact that the son of the 
rich man is in revolt against his father and in 
sympathy with the workers. The story of the 
strike itself is told with conviction. An I. W. 
W. reporter would be glad to write with so 
much vigor of phrase and emotional appeal. 
And the woman's experiences before she becomes 
a hop-picker, her struggles to earn a living and 
keep straight in a world dominated by the pred- 
atory male, seem to be real adventures and not 
special pleading. It is a book which any good 
craftsman would be willing to sign, and I can- 
not see the reason for anonymity. I look with 
suspicion on the publisher's statement that 
"obviously the author of this startling narra- 
tive . . . would not, and could not, sign 
the manuscript," but I am willing to connive 
with him in advertising the book by exciting 
curiosity about it. 

Another anonymous novel is "The Empty 
House." It deals with another problem of 
woman: the wealthy woman whose husband is 
absorbed in business, who has no children 
because she does not want them, and who does 
not get much happiness out of an apparently 
prosperous life. It is a vivacious story with an 
air of determination to speak out and tell the 
truth. What it tells is interesting. But after 
all it does not tell very much. The manner is 
sometimes irritating, if the reader is over- 
sensitive to literary manner. In trying to sound 
human and natural the author makes an 
unnecessary sacrifice of sentence-construction. 
However, she does give the effect of a woman 
talking plain talk, and she is worth listening to. 

The childless woman in Mrs. Mary Hallock 
Foote's "Edith Bonham" finds her consolation in 
the care of another woman's children after their 
mother's death. She wins an extra reward for 
her devotion bv marrying the children's father, 
which is a good old-fashioned ending, a natural 



outcome of the circumstances. Here is at least 
one wedding in our new novels to which I give 
a reviewer's benediction. The contest under 
unusual circumstances between the man and 
the woman, both endowed with strong wills 
and honest minds, is firmly drawn. Mrs. Foote 
is one of our veteran novelists and she knows 
her business. I ask, however, with due respect 
whether the book should not end on page 321, 
whether the postscript is not superfluous. 

A novelist who is not yet a veteran, but is 
going to be if the gods spare him, is Mr. Ernest 
Poole. Of recent novels by the younger Ameri- 
can writers "His Family" is the best I have 
read. "The Harbor" was promising. "His 
Family" is an achievement, almost a mature 
achievement. It is not quite mature, because 
Mr. Poole sometimes allows himself to write 
with an amateurish awkwardness which a 
trained hand would correct. "A small demure 
woman of thirty-five, with light soft hair and 
clear blue eyes and limbs softly rounded, the 
contour of her features was full of approaching 
maternity." "Of medium height and a wiry 
build, his quick kindly smile of greeting did not 
conceal the fine tight lines about his mouth and 
between his eyes." "The house was one of a 
dozen others." "Listening from his study, 
again the feeling came to him of her fresh and 
abundant vitality." Such sentences betray the 
writer who has not learned what any artist 
born with Mr. Poole's sense of beauty can learn 
by thoughtful labor. In the substance as well 
as the style are signs of the author who is not 
yet artistically grown up, commonplace reflec- 
tions on life, the saying of things that need not 
be said, and saying them too often. Having 
established by his title and by the relationship 
of his characters that the theme of the book is 
"Family," the continuity of life through the 
generations, Mr. Poole repeats the theme many 
times without variations; thereby he loses the 
power of suggestion and gives the impression 
of an impoverishment of ideas in a book which 
is rich and vital. For, to have done with quarrel- 
ing, it is a rich book, full of the stuff of life. 
Roger Gale is the finest old father of a family 
since Silas Lapham, of whom in many ways he 
reminds me. And the resemblance, or, if the 
resemblance is not as close as I think, the 
recollection is a compliment to Mr. Poole. For 
Mr. Howells is a master in the portraval of 
elderlv men. Silas Lapham and Judge Kenton 
are his best characters. (The young people are 
not so well done : Mr. Howells is afraid of their

passions.) Mr. Poolc keeps his elderly man 
the central figure in the book, and hangs about 
him the three several stories of his daughters, 
each one of which is a good story in itself. The 
girls and their young men arc distinctly character- 
ized and live their own lives, as independent of 
the author (when he lets them alone and does 
not rub his theme into us) as they are inde- 
pendent of their perplexed and affectionate old 
father. 

A glass of light wine to go with the rather 
serious novels we have been consuming is Mr. 
Allen Updegraff's "Second Youth." In Amer- 
ica we have not enough of this sort of light- 
handed humor. There is a touch of farce in 
the postulated situation, which you have to 
grant and are very willing to grant. Once that 
is granted or accepted, you move along in a 
romantic adventure which is conducted in the 
true spirit of comedy. The material is of the 
quality that ought to make good plays, and I 
hope that some time, many times, Mr. Upde- 
graff's humor and gay feeling for the human 
being will be found combined with whatever 
other talents are necessary to write for the stage.

HHIEFS ox XEW BOOKS 



OVER THE TOP. By Arthur Guy Empey. 

Putnam's; $1.50. 

"It is the real stuff." For once the publisher's 
urgent description does not exaggerate; for in 
this unpretentious volume is caught at last the 
soul of Tommy Atkins. A voice has risen from 
the trenches that speaks his language. From 
the ranks has come an intelligence, hardly con- 
scious even of itself, that has looked into the 
simple heart of the soldier, and has seen there 
the loyalty and courage, the grim humor, the 
boyishness, the playfulness, above all, the mod- 
esty of men who do not know that they are 
heroes. And yet this soldier-author deals little 
in reflection. He has held the mirror up to 
human nature as he has found it in the English 
private soldier and the reader has but to look 
in and see. 

Mr. Empey is a young American who could 
not wait for his country to come in. He left 
his home in New Jersey early in the war, went 
to London and enlisted, saw a year and a half 
of real fighting and came back to England more 
dead than alive, after having lain wounded for 
thirty-six hours in No Man's Land. Honorably 
discharged as no longer fit for active service, he 
IN now hack in his home country, making public 



addresses whose modesty and graphic power 
will surprise no one who has read his book. 

The book is a cheerful record ot this soldier's 
life as he lived it from day to day. K\rr\ page 
of it is alive with color the jolting rides in 
cattle trains, the mud of the trenches, the "coo- 
ties" (tiny insects on whom Tommy wages con- 
stant petty war), the good-humored quarrels 
over rations, the rude play which Empey wrote 
during two weeks in "rest billets" back of the 
line, the solemn service over a comrade's grave. 

One of the many stirring incidents of the book 
is the story of the coward who "came back. 
Condemned to die at 3:38 in the morning for 
desertion he found himself freed by a German 
bullet which killed his guard, and rushing to 
the front, took charge of a machine gun whose 
crew had all been killed, and turned it on the 
enemy in time to save his own company from 
annihilation. As his comrades were returning 
he fell with a bullet in his brain. The court's 
order was duly carried out. for the hour wa- 
3:38. 

Such a book may well become one of the best- 
sellers. Its story never flags. It is human and 
the men who fill its pages are simple children, 
brave without heroics, tender-hearted, loyal, and 
enduring. The author is merely one of them, 
modest as they are and with a narrative power 
that is impressive. His book will appeal to young 
and old alike, to all who love pathos and humor, 
great deeds, and manly men, and no reader will 
put it. down without being glad that someone 
put a writer in the trenches. 

THE MAN IN COURT. By F. DeW. Wells. 

Putnam's; $1.50. 

The law's delay has long been a favorite sub- 
ject with humorists and other men of purpn-r. 
not to omit mention of the modern reporter. 
The present author has chosen the straight- 
forward descriptive method, and in knowledge 
of the subject is well fitted for his task. He h >.- 
attempted simply to bring his reader into touch 
with the everyday workings of courts in this 
country, and thus to leave him with certain in- 
evitable conclusions. It is a sorry story, though 
not ungraciously told. Starting with a descrip- 
tion of the drab scene of a Night Court where 
the "visitor leaves with a sense of having hi< 
1 values overthrown," Judge Wells take-s 
his reader through a variety of court proceed 
under such chapter titles as "The Anxious Jury." 
"The Strenuous Lawyer," "The Worried Cli- 
ent." "The Confused Witness." and "Tho*,- 
Technical Objections." The descriptions are 
clear and are enlivened by occasional touches of 
humor, usually through the telling of some odd 
incident. The book ends with a chapter called 
I >oking Backward." in which the author

shows the present legal machinery broken down 
by 1947, and all law business carried on by 
Judicial Corporations, just as real-estate titles 
are now certified by Title Guarantee companies. 
Unfortunately for so sincere and sane a work, 
the style lacks grace, and the argument drags 
at times. That the facts are interesting for all 
that, is no small tribute to the author. 

THE IDEALS OF PAINTING. By J. Comyns 

Carr. Macmillan ; $2. 

"This volume," says the prefatory note, "lays 
no claim to original research, nor does it affect 
to furnish an exhaustive record of the life and 
work even of the more eminent masters of mod- 
ern Europe. Its purpose is rather to assist those 
students who desire to obtain a general view 
of the movement of painting from the time of 
Giotto to the present day; and to compare and 
contrast the spiritual ideals that have been pur- 
sued and perfected in the work of separate schools 
laboring under the dominating impulse supplied 
by individual genius." Mr. Carr carries out his 
purpose in a pleasant, ambling manner which 
makes his book very different from most hand- 
books of art. He surveys in turn the "ideals" 
of Italy, Flanders, Germany, Holland, Spain, 
France, and England, but just what the "ideals" 
are the reader cannot clearly discern. There is 
any amount of interesting detail, comparison, 
analysis, and assertion ; but no pattern of a theory 
of life, related in specific ways to the theories 
of life of the others, emerges for any one of these 
lands. Mr. Carr has missed an opportunity; for 
the arts of peoples, far more than their philoso- 
phies or religions, incarnate their essential spirit 
and outlook. Its designation afresh in terms of 
the pictorial art is a desirable thing, and if Mr. 
Carr fails of it, it is because of his deference to 
the tradition of criticism. His spontaneous judg- 
ment seems robust enough to have achieved it, 
and will perhaps lead him to try again. 

YOUR NATIONAL PARKS. By Enos A. 

Mills. Houghton Mifflin; $2.50. 

"The Piute Indians have a legend which says 
that just at the close of creation the woman was 
consulted. She at once called into existence the 
birds, the flowers, and the trees." Thus writes 
Enos Mills at the beginning of one of his chap- 
ters. He believes thoroughly in that kind of 
woman and he believes also in learning to love 
the things she called into existence and in creat- 
ing islands of safety for them, which are also 
pleasure grounds for human beings. This brings 
up the question that rose in our mind when we 
examined his book. Are the national parks 
created alone for preserving and exhibiting our 
country's marvellous wonders, or should their 



greater purpose be to provide great playgrounds 
for the public? If they have a dual purpose, then 
the thought at once arises that at present they 
are hardly impartially distributed, the eastern, 
central, and southern states being almost wholly 
neglected. Of course there are city and state 
parks, but these are never on the scale that thrills 
the imagination as the national parks do. Mr. 
Mills himself names several spots in these less- 
favored sections which he considers fitted to be 
parks: the Dunes, a portion of the South Caro- 
lina shore, the Mammoth Cave region, and 
several others. 

The bulk of the book is given over to an ex- 
haustive treatment of all the national parks. 
The peculiar natural beauties of each are de- 
scribed with considerable detail; the history of 
their discovery and final change into parks is 
told; and a clear explanation of their natural 
phenomena given. This valuable matter, the 
reading of which is almost necessary for real en- 
joyment of these great scenic playgrounds, is 
supplemented by a splendid appendix, which gives 
everything in the way of information regarding 
access to the parks, hotels, trips, camping facili- 
ties, costs, etc., that a possible visitor might want. 

PLAYS AND PLAYERS: Leaves from a 

Critic's Scrapbook. By Walter Prichard 

Eaton. Stewart & Kidd; $2. 

Mr. Eaton groups the play reviews in this 
book in three sections American Plays, Foreign 
Plays, and Shakespearean Revivals; and there is 
a fourth section made up of short essays on 
topics connected with drama and the theatre. 
It is worth noting that the section on American 
plays is by far the longest; our theatres are de- 
pending less and less on translations and adapta- 
tions. It is encouraging, too, to find so many 
relatively good plays in the American list 
"The Piper," "Kindling," "As a Man Thinks," 
^'Kismet," "The Yellow Jacket," "Romance," 
"The Unchastened Woman." The foreign plays 
discussed include "Hindle Wakes," "The Pi- 
geon," "Justice," "The Legend of Leonora," 
"Androcles and the Lion," and "The Weavers." 
On the whole, we need not be ashamed of the 
American showing; if we have no master to set 
against Galsworthy, Shaw, or Hauptmann, we 
have in "The Piper" a play of rare and dis- 
tinguished beauty, as likely to be of permanent 
interest as any in either list; and the other 
American plays represent genuine achievement 
both in realism and in romance. Easy and col- 
loquial in style, Mr. Eaton's criticism is nearly 
always suggestive or constructive, and custom 
has not staled his gusto. To the general reader 
perhaps the most interesting part of the book 
will be the last section, with its lively discussions 
of what constitutes a good play, personality in

acting, and the new art of the theatre. The

ington Square Players. 

PROFILES FROM CHINA. By Eunice Tiet- 

jens. Ralph Fletcher Seymour; $1. 

A good deal of the discussion as to whether 
free verse is really poetry has seemed futile to 
the reviewer: the arguments pro and con have 
led into so many blind alleys or else have been 
so absurd as to be simply amusing. One won- 
ders why all these heated antagonists cannot ac- 
cept this new poetic expression for what it is, 
and neither judge it by its worst examples nor 
argue that it takes the place of metrical verse. 
Many prose poems, expressions of single sensa- 
tions or short stories, cannot be brushed aside as 
trivialities. They have distinct and decided 
charm. 

Among those which deserve to be cherished 
are Mrs. Tietjens's "Profiles from China." The 
poems are distinguished first by their almost un- 
failing subjectivity. The writer nearly always 
interprets each sight in terms of her own reac- 
tion. The poetry is personal, intimate, confiden- 
tial. We do not mean that it is autobiographical, 
but that Mrs. Tietjens quickly establishes a 
close relation between herself and the reader. 
She sees dirty, crowded China with a quick eye, 
and puts it before us with its gods and beggars, 
walls, women and dandies, rickshas and camels 
all portrayed with humor, fear, sympathy, 
pathos, irony, and imagination. That is, it is 
weighted with an emotional appeal and lively 
imagery. We quote from one of the most beau- 
tiful. 

THE MOST SACRED MOUNTAIN 

Space, and the twelve clean winds of heaven, 

And this sharp exultation, like a cry, after the slow 

six thousand steps of climbing! 
This is Tai Shan, the beautiful, the most holy. 

Below my feet the foot-hills nestle, brown with flecks 
of green; and lower down the flat brown plain, 
the floor of earth, stretches away to blue in- 
finity. 

Beside me in this airy space the temple roofs cut their 
low curves against the sky, 

And one black bird circles above the void. 

Space, and the twelve clean winds are here; 

And with them broods eternity a swift, white peace, 

a presence manifest. 
The rhythm ceases here. Time has no place. This 

is the end that has no end. 

But I shall go down from this airy space, this swift 
white peace, this stinging exultation ; 

And time will close about me, and my soul stir to 
the rhythm of the daily round. 

Vet, having known, life will not press so close, and 
always I shall feel time ravel thin about me; 

For once I stood 

In the white windy presence of eternity. 



THE BOOK OF CAMPING. By A. Hyatt 

Verrill. Knopf ; $1. 

This instructive little book aims to supph 
the beginner's need for a primer in woodcraft, 
and in the main it succeeds in its purpose. It 
contains much useful information for the neo- 
phyte camper and is especially valuable for its 
practical hints about camp sites, camp house - 
keeping, cooking, and accidents. At times, in its 
efforts to be superpractical, it overshoots the 
mark. No old woodsman, for example, would 
call lean-to's or shacks of evergreen boughs or 
bark, whose construction is minutely described, 
"comfortable permanent summer camps." He 
knows them for stuffy insect-traps. To him the 
directions for homemade traps and moccasins are 
reminiscent of the days when he really believed 
all that was set forth in Dan Beard's "Ameri- 
can Boy's Handy Book." This fault the fault 
of telling how to make clumsy things that can 
better be bought often gets into "how-to" books. 
However, if salted with the knowledge that the 
old camper's first rule is "Be comfortable sensi- 
bly," this little handbook will be very valuable to 
the novice. 

Hi SSIAN MEMORIES. By Madame Olga 

Novikoff. Dutton; $3.50. 

Madame Novikoff's strong reassertion of the 
might and the right of Russian imperialism 
strikes a startling note in the revolutionary at- 
mosphere of to-day. She is said to have been 
in great part responsible for the Anglo-Russian 
alliance of the present war. It was a peaceful 
alliance she strove for during forty years, but 
she is none the less satisfied that a common foe 
should have brought the two countries to a closer 
understanding. Her activities won from Dis- 
raeli the doubtful compliment implied in the 
title "The M. P. for Russia in England." Of 
a more friendly nature was the praise bestowed 
upon her by Carlyle, Kinglake, and Froude, as 
well as by Gladstone, who took her side during 
the tide of Turkish feeling in England during 
the '70's. 

At the time of the Turkish atrocities in Bul- 
garia, her brother, Nicholas Kireeff, arming him- 
self with relief money and hospital materials. 
hastened to do his bit in behalf of the southern 
Slavs. Becoming fired with enthusiasm for their 
cause, he joined the Serbian ranks as an officer, 
and was shot in the first charge. His fame im- 
mediately spread ; he \\ as acclaimed a hero 
throughout Russia and the Balkans; and thou- 
sands followed his example as volunteers. But 
to his sister's distraught mind it was England 
that had killed him. "It is England," she wrote, 
"who prevents our Government from helping 
our brethren in the Balkans." Upon reflection. 
she saw that the remedy for such blunders in the 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



117 



future would be a better understanding between 
her country and England, and to this end she 
devoted all her energies, her unfailing charm, 
and her capacity for sympathy and comprehen- 
sion. At a time when Lord Beaconsfield and the 
larger part of England were speaking in the 
highest terms of their ally, Abdul Hamid, "whose 
every impulse is good," her self-imposed mission 
was none of the lightest; nor was Disraeli's epi- 
thet the most discourteous she received. The 
period was one of which modern Englishmen are 
little likely to boast, so that some of her retro- 
spective bitterness is perhaps unnecessary. Her 
"Memories" include, besides political material, 
reminiscences of the musicians and writers of the 
day, and of other prominent men and women in 
the two countries. Since it is a chapter of na- 
tional life that is perhaps closed, it gains in 
interest at this time. The author has apparently 
spent little time on the ordered preparation of 
her book, but her manner of writing is invari- 
ably engaging and intelligent. 



NOTES OK NEW FICTIOST 



Imagine a book that starts like an essay on 
modern philosophy, continues like a confession, 
goes at a bound into fiction, shifts into the man- 
ner of a Kipling fairy tale, and ends in perfect 
consistency with them all. Such is Stella Ben- 
son's "This Is the End" (Macmillan; $1.35). 
One may take it quite literally, and remain 
puzzled by a few various matters. It is fairly 
safe to say that however one takes it there will 
still be puzzling things about it. What a reader 
gets from it, after all, will be in proportion to 
the imagination, sympathy, and intelligence that 
he brings. Was it Sainte-Beuve who maintained 
that in reading over old papers one never finds 
more than half the matter in print ? The other 
half lies in the minds of contemporary readers 
and constitutes by no means the least effectual 
part. Every significant book stimulates its read- 
ers to the office of participant; Miss Benson's 
does so in a peculiar degree. 

One imagines that Miss Benson must be some- 
thing like her own Jay. For Jay "was a per- 
son who took nothing in the world for granted, 
but as she had only a slight connection with the 
world, that is not saying very much. Nothing 
ever embittered Jay, not even her own pessimism. 
There is a finality about bitterness and Jay was 
never final." You may look upon Jay's secret 
story as "an imaginary hieroglyphic," if you will; 
you may look upon Miss Benson's story as a fan- 
tasy, an extravaganza, a symbol, or a subtle com- 
ment upon contemporary life. It is all these in 
part, and therefore people will enjoy it for dif- 
ferent reasons and in different wavs. She her- 



self says: "This is the end, for the moment, of 
all my thinking, this is my unfinal conclusion. 
There is no reason in tangible things, and no 
system in the ordinary ways of the world. Hands 
were made to grope, and feet to stumble, and 
the only things you may count on are the un- 
accountable things. There are no reasons except 
reasons you and I don't know. . . But if 
the things which I know in spite of my education 
were false, if the eyes of the sea forgot their 
secret, or if the accent of the steep woods became 
vulgar, if the fairy adventures that happen in 
my heart fell flat, if the good friends my eyes 
have never seen failed me then indeed should 
I know emptiness, and an astonishment that 
would kill." 

No account of the book would be complete 
that did not mention the war, for the war is 
through it, beneath it, part of its very making, 
and yet always unobtrusive. The war is a hu- 
morous thing, it is a commonplace thing, it is an 
overwhelming, flat, disillusioning thing that de- 
scends and robs the world of all hope and of all 
light. Perhaps it is superfluous to add that Miss 
Benson is a writer of unusual skill. She is, how- 
ever, something more than brilliant, humorous, 
and fantastic. What this something is, she sends 
out a challenge to the individual reader to dis- 
cover. 

Perhaps F. T. Wawn's "The Joyful Years" 
is best described as a first-rate, second-rate novel. 
It is one of those stories of solid worth which 
only the English writers seem able to produce. 
On every page there is evidence of the trained 
thinker and writer who has observed life. There 
is never a hint of "inspiration," none of the 
slovenliness of the "divine fire." At the start 
one meets several interesting people, and having 
found them to be genuine people and not "char- 
acters," one settles comfortably back, knowing 
that whatever happens will make interesting read- 
ing. There is a middle-aged journalist with a 
whimsical philosophy and a delicious cynicism ; 
there is a young woman who is mildly rebellious 
toward the British respectability of her family; 
then there is a young clerk of excellent family but 
with no prospects, and against him there is the 
successful Official, his employer and rival in love. 
Of course there is nothing new in the situation, 
but there is much that is new in the way the 
various characters develop under that situation. It 
is this avoidance of effort at originality in plot 
which is so admirable, for the true artist finds his 
material in character rather than situation and is 
as much interested in what his people think as 
in what they do. It is worth remarking, in 
passing, that although the war plays a part in 
the story, it is handled with some perspective. 
The book may be recommended for those who

THE DIAL 



[August lf 



Whenever the reviewer finds a subject that is 
commonly a novelist's excuse for sensation, actu- 
ally treated with relative truth and soberness, 
his impulse is to give the author hearty accla- 
mation irrespective of the real value of his per- 
formance. Joseph McCabe, in "The Pope's 
Favorite" (Dodd, Mead; $1.50), has succeeded 
in giving a truthful representation of the reign 
(one can call it no less) of Alexander VI, the 
Borgia Pope. His knowledge of the times has 
perhaps led him a little astray as far as narrative 
unity is concerned ; his story is more an incidental 
description of the lives and deeds of that notorious 
personage, his favorita Giulia, and the papal 
"nephew" and "niece," Cesare and Lucrezia, 
than it is a properly conducted plot. But by 
smashing a number of cherished traditions con- 
cerning Rodrigo Borgia, he represents him as a 
really very possible sort of person. If the title 
cause the reader to expect a book that he will 
conceal behind a magazine in public, he will be 
misled. It is hardly pour Us jtunes filles, neither 
is it for the sensation seekers. It is simply a 
good historical novel one of the best that it has 
been our luck to see in a long time. 

Why cannot authors get together a bit in this 
matter of plot and setting? Why must we be 
subjected invariably to a Broadway plot in a 
Broadway setting, and to an Alaskan plot in an 
Alaskan setting? Stage a Baroness Orczy story 
in the Yukon, for instance, and you might have 
something rather piquant. These dispiriting re- 
flections are caused by the perusal of a new snow- 
and-primitive-man tale entitled "The Yukon 
Trail," by William MacLeod Raine ( Houghton 
Mifflin; $1.35). It will be all the same to you 
whether you read this novel or any one of half 
a dozen of the same variety of the present sea- 
son. It is a fairly plausible, well-planned yarn 
that clings to the traditions of its type and its 
setting. 

One seldom encounters a book which may be 
added to the group of which "Huckleberry Finn" 
and "The Story of a Bad Boy" are the classics. 
Although Edward Bellamy Partridge by no 
means approaches those two stories in "Sube 
Cane" he has nevertheless written an authentic 
story of boyhood. It is quite true that "Sube" 
is "all boy." His is the ingenuity and ingenu- 
ousness of adolescence and those who have a 
furtive sympathy with the innate genius for mis- 
chief which characterizes youth will find a hu- 
mor which does not tax their credulity or 
patience. The author knows the psychology of 
boys and has written a story in which there is a 
genuine appreciation of a boy's character and 
mind. (Penn; $1.35.) 



CASUAL, COMMI N i 

1 UK TENTACLES OF MR. HEARST hu\ e 
reached out and have gathered in another repre- 
sentative periodical. The International Maga- 
zine Company, which has already appropriated 
the "Cosmopolitan" and "Harper's Bazar," is 
now reported as having closed in on "Puck." 
Having conquered the library table and the bou- 
doir, Mr. Hearst is now to conquer the barber 
shop. The library table, thanks to him, is not 
what it once was, nor is the boudoir; so why 
should one expect the barber shop to remain un- 
changed? The Hearstian breeze wafts itself 
over flowery banks stealing and giving odors, 
and often making two odors, or two dozen 
though of a pungent sort not hitherto known or 
relished grow where but one grew before. The 
man who is waiting two or three minutes for 
the next vacant chair was well worth going 
after. He is many, and in those two or three 
minutes he may be able, if taken decisively in 
hand (as he doubtless will be), to come to im- 
portant determinations in matters of statesman- 
ship and of sociology. The saloon as a political 
molecule threatens to pass: welcome the newer 
and better (or different) political molecule, the 
tonsorial parlor. 

THE GROWING TASTE OF THE JAPANESE FOR 

READING continues to excite wide remark. Less 
than fifty years ago literature was the interest 
of the few: the "Daigaku" and the "Rongo," 
two classics setting forth Confucian precepts, 
were held to be sufficient intellectual food for 
the average samurai child. To-day not the sec- 
ond-hand book shops of London or of New York, 
not the quais of Paris can compete with the Jimbo 
Cho, in the student quarter of Kanda. English 
titles are first in number, as the English language 
is learned by all students in the higher schools, 
and as all foreign literature is likely to be studied 
through English translations. Among British 
authors themselves, Shaw, Wilde, Conan Doyle, 
Tagore, and Gordon Craig are prominent. 
Among Continental authors Nietzsche, Ibsen, 
Eucken, Schopenhauer, Maupassant, Verlaine, 
and Maeterlinck have their following. Among 
the novelists, the Russians enjoy the inside track 
Turgenev, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Gorky. Japan 
regards the Russians as tremendouslv vital and 
expressive; and as Japanese canons of good taste 
forbid too open an indulgence in the feelings, this 
stoic people finds a sort of vicarious M-lt-i-xpres- 
sion through the willing Muscovites. As is 
shown by the names cited, the Japanese prefer- 
ence is for the moderns of the Occidental world, 
not for the long-established classic. 1 \cn the 
cubists and futurists enjoy a welcome. '1

fluctuates, of course; but it may be said, in a 
general way, that, at present, it runs more to the 
sober and serious than it did not long ago. 
Books of psychological, ethical, and political in- 
terest have succeeded the licentious stories for- 
merly so much in vogue. The censor has been 
busy among Maupassant, Flaubert, Tolstoy, and 
Kropotkin as the result, possibly, of love trage- 
dies which have involved several of the "new" 
men and women. "New women" writers and 
authors of stories of geisha intrigues tend more 
and more to be neglected. The corrective even 
runs farther: among periodicals all kinds of tech- 
nical magazines are reported to be in great de- 
mand; and the most widely circulated of all are 
those which address themselves to woman and 
the home. 

PRESIDENT WILSON IN FRENCH such is the 
promise conveyed by the announcement that his 
"History of the American People," in five vol- 
umes, is to be published in France and the French 
colonjes by Bossard, of Paris, under arrange- 
ment with Harper & Bros., the President's 
American publishers. The translation is to be 
made by Professor Roustan, of the Lycee Louis- 
le-Grand, and the introduction will be written 
by Emile Boutroux, of the French Academy. 
Some of the President's critics have noted that 
his long series of state papers, through the past 
three troubled years, were penned quite as much 
with a view to history as to the crisis they dealt 
with: his concern for style helped make it seem 
that he was writing with an eye to posterity. 
If the opinion of the foreign peoples of our own 
day may be considered as constituting a kind of 
contemporaneous posterity, the President will be 
able to appraise the extent and quality of his 
own future fame before he quits this present 
sphere. 

AN OUTSPOKEN AND CHARACTERISTIC ESTI- 
MATE OF THE RECRUIT can be picked up from 
Captain Agate's new book, "L. of C." (Lines of 
Communication). Says he: "The man who en- 
lists for his sweet country's sake is a bit of a 
nuisance who should have been born a leading 
article. The man we most \vant is he who en- 
lists for a lark, or because everybody else is 
enlisting, or for a jumble of reasons, or for no 
reason at all." The reader may gloss such a 
pronouncement according to his own nature and 
taste. Some will gather the idea that the humble 
private is best, in the English army, as in the 
German, when he does not exercise his mind, 
or when he has no mind to exercise. Others 
will see a left-handed compliment, based on ad- 
miration for the man who minimizes emotion, 
even if he be emotionally hidebound. Perhaps 



the latter is the true reading; witness the recent 
volumes of soldier slang, the recent examples of 
soldiers' songs: the former briskly fending off 
all approach to the feelings, the latter, often 
ribald and silly, never dignified, never patriotic. 
Perhaps the reactions of our own troops will 
soon throw additional light on the emotional 
make-up of English-speaking peoples in times of 
patriotic service and of danger. 



A NEW WAY OF PUTTING TOGETHER ENCY- 
CLOPAEDIAS has been devised. It is the plan so 
long pursued in the putting together of world's 
fairs: on the basis of the country. Harper and 
Brothers are to issue an encyclopaedic library of 
twenty-four special encyclopaedias, each compris- 
ing six volumes and each devoted to a particular 
race or nation or region. The first set deals with 
the Slavonic race. The set to be devoted to the 
United States will be, it is promised, the most 
comprehensive and detailed account of us yet at- 
tempted. The necessary financial backing for 
this extensive enterprise is furnished by Mr. 
Adolph Lewisohn, of New York, and the edi- 
torial supervisor will be Dr. Isidore Singer, as- 
sisted by a board selected from the faculties of 
various American universities. It is understood 
that Mr. Lewisohn has taken this means of com- 
memorating the fiftieth anniversary of his ar- 
rival in this country. A set of books may be 
as enduring and satisfactory a memorial as the 
chain of library buildings in which they may 
find themselves housed. 



WILL THE OBER-AMMERGAU PASSION PLAY 
SURVIVE? Or, more specifically and immediately, 
will it revive for 1920? No war within man's 
memory has imperilled this ancient observance 
at the heart of the Bavarian highlands until the 
present one. Late visitors to the village speak 
of it as a haunted place, struggling to live on in 
memories of the past a past more tender of 
long-established tradition than the iconoclastic 
days which we now endure. They report that 
the spirit which made and kept the play is lack- 
ing, as well as the cast. Anton Lang, the 
"Christus," renouncing his dream of a pilgrimage 
to the Holy Land after the return of peace, 
has been called to the colors, following the 
"John the Baptist" and other participants into 
the strife. A new world will emerge, with gains, 
let us hope ; with losses, assuredly ; and the pious, 
remote institution dating from the seventeenth 
century may be among the things to the sacrifice 
of which the coming day will have regretfully 
to adjust itself.

ENGLISH 
LITERATURE 

AN INTRODUCTION AND GUIDE 

TO THE BEST ENGLISH BOOKS 

A HANDBOOK POK SCHOOLS AND READERS 

By EDWIN L MILLER. A. M. 

Principal Detroit. Mich.. Northwestern High School 

78 unusual illustrations. S97 pages. Map 
and charts. Large 12mo. $1.60 net 

The Needed Quality 

The quality of a manual on English Lit- 
erature is probably more important than 
that of any other book in use. Literature is 
nothing, if it is not a living source of in- 
spiration or pleasure, it cannot be taught 
as a dead language, or a mathematical 
formula. With this in mind Professor Miller 
planned his new text-book. 

What Sometimes Happens 

It is generally acknowledged that the 
reading habit is often greatly weakened 
sometimes completely destroyed in the 
schools. Tennyson knew this and despaired 
upon learning that "Enoch Arden" had been 
adopted for class-room study. Dates and 
places are important but less important than 
the ideals, ideas and purposes of the great 
writers as shown in their works. Too often 
the boy's or girl's study of fact obscures the 
core of the subject the beauty, the stimu- 
lus. How often is this the fault of text- 
books, the introduction to a live matter 
through a dead medium? 

What Should Be the Object 

The object of text-books in English I.itrr- 
erature should be to stimulate readers to a 
love and appreciation of the best and to 
lead them into the habit of reading the good 
and great books for enjoyment as well as 
learning. This new book by Professor Miller 
has been planned throughout with this in 
mind. The pages are not burdened with 
facts but with stimulating ideas. Emphasis 
is laid upon forces and influences not upon 
dates. During the preparation of the book 
the author gave careful consideration to 
every important pedagogical principle. 
Isn't that the right sort of book for in- 
troducing young people to the vast field of 
Literature which is intended for the inter- 
pretation and enrichment of life ?

Pictures by several famous authors h.i\e come 
into the possession of Patrick F. Madigan, of 5t>l 
Fifth Avenue. New York. Among them is a 
sketch of Marie Antoinette by William M. 
Thackeray, who for years worked with brush 
and palette in Paris, and who, it will be recalled. 
waited on Charles Dickens in the hope that he 
might be employed to illustrate the "Pickwick 
Papers." Another sketch is by Dickens, the head 
of a young Spanish girl, which he drew for the 
album of his sister, Laetitia, afterward the wife of 
his friend Henry Austin. It is in cu. 

There is a drawing by Victor Hugo of a 
mediaeval stronghold, with black towers and pinna- 
cles. Hugo was an artist of considerable merit. 
Some of his productions were made with cigar- 
ends smeared with ink. During his residence in 
Germany he sketched upon the walls of his bed- 
room, on the table linen, on the backs of 
letters and tradesmen's bills. Alfred Tenn 
at Farringford, passed leisure moments at the 
easel. The painter Watts urged him to continue 
this work, saying, "Add a dash even-day and you 
will soon have a picture." Several early sketches 
by Tennyson, some of them with his autograph. 
have been sold at public auction. The Tennyson 
drawing in Mr. Madigan *s possession is of a 
ruined castle. 

Robert Browning is another author who is 
represented. His sketch is a study of three Rus- 
sians standing in front of a building; he sent this 
drawing from the Continent to several members of 
his family. Browning devoted a great deal of his 
time to obtaining odd effects with his impromptu 
pictures. One of his diversions was roasting 
brown paper over a candle to produce weird 
results. There is a sketch also by CharKv K ngs- 
le\. whose skill with the pencil was unusual, and 
who at one time founded and taught a drawing- 
class at Bideford. Many examples by him are 
scattered among his friends, their heirs, and 
cessors. The present sketch is a clever study of 
a fisherman. 

Readers of the "Just So Stories" know that 
Rudyard Kipling is an artist of an uncommon 
order. Among Mr. Madinan's sketches is a draw- 
ing of a tiger's head R 'ing. William S. 
Gilbert, author of the "Bab Ballads." "Pinafore. " 
and other successful works, is represented by a 
sketch of a witch. Henry W. Longfellow has a 
drawing of himself, made while he was a student 
at Gottingen. Germany, and intended for "S. 
presumably Samuel Longfel! 

George D. Smith, of New York, paid about 
twenty-rive thousand dollars for eight Portolano 
manuscripts and works in the sale of the sixth 
portion of the famous Henry Huth library ar 
Sotheby's, in London. One o." the manuscripts 
appears to have been executed by an Italian 
geographer, but to have been intended for a 
,sh or Portuguese navigator, as the route on 
one of the maps starts from Lisbon, and another 
route is marked from the same place across the

Isthmus of Panama. The southwest coast of 
South America is left blank, which would fix the 
date as not later than 1525 or 1530. The Island 
of Rhodes is still marked as belonging to the ! 
Knights of St. John, though it was taken by Ae i 
Turks in 1522, but it is probable that the conquest 
by the Turks was then looked upon as only tern- ' 
porary. Another manuscript consists of eighteen j 
maps, seven of which relate to both North and 
South America. In the map of Africa the source 
of the Nile is made to appear to be two large i 
lakes in the centre of the country. Loosely j 
inserted are a large pen-and-ink drawing of a plan j 
of Mexico and two tracings. A third manuscript 
is preceded by an almanac and contains a great 
portion of the coasts of North and South America. 
On a fourth chart are laid down the coast lines of 
the Americas with names of the places of "Nou- 
velle France," "Nova Anglia," "Maryland," "Vir- 
ginia," "Terra Florida," "Nova Hispania," "luca- 
tan," and "Honduras." 

An illuminated manuscript on twenty double 
sheets of vellum forms an atlas of the whole world 
as known at the end of the sixteenth or beginning 
of the seventeenth century, including the discoveries 
in America. It is beautifully executed with an 
ornamental border around each map. The last 
three sheets are occupied by an almanac and 
astronomical calculations and directions. It came 
from the library of the Archbishop of Toledo. 
The arms of Portugal and Spain are emblazoned 
on each map. Another Portolano, printed at 
Venice in 1490, is divided into two parts. The 
first has a separate colophon. The work is the 
first edition. It is cited by Panzer and Hain, 
but it is evident that neither of them had ever 
seen it. The authorship is ascribed to Aloisio 
Cadamosto, the famous navigator and companion 
of Prince Henry of Portugal. It was reprinted 
under his name at Venice in 1806. 

Gabriel Wells, of New York, recently obtained 
about three hundred unpublished letters of the poet 
James Whitcomb Riley. They are all addressed to 
Miss Clara L. Bottsford, with whom Riley was 
in love. She was a school-teacher whose home 
was at Philadelphia, Ind., near Greenfield. The 
letters begin in 1877 and continue to 1885. They 
\vere written at the rate of about three a week. 
In them Riley gives interesting details of his life. 
He speaks of his lecture tours, his career as an 
author, and other matters. Some of the letters 
are humorous and others are pathetic. In the 
final letter Riley announces that the engagement 
between them is broken off. He speaks of Miss 
Bottsford's conduct toward him, and says that he 
now realizes that their love-making was all a 
dream. He tells her that she is not worthy of 
his love. He asks her to return all the letters he 
has written to her and promises to send back all 
that she has written to him. Miss Bottsford 
subsequently married a saloon-keeper. She is now 
dead. Besides teaching school she wrote poetry, 
some of which appeared in the Indianapolis 
"Journal." In his letters Riley speaks of her 
poems and suggests some corrections and altera- 
tions. She did not return the letters as he asked. 
Mr. Wells has since sold the lettprs to a collector 
interested in the publication of such material.

Important as a revelation, through the eager 
wide-awake eyes of a boy, of the life of all 
lower Russia. Standing in its midst, young 
Gorky looks around and reports the world 
bounded by his varying horizon, always with 
passionate sincerity, and often with flaming 
beauty. 

Three things are of paramount interest in 
his story: the men with whom he came into 
contact and their influence in his mental and 
moral attitude toward life; the books with 
which, during the impressionable adolescent 
years, he fed his imagination to forget the dis- 
agreeable work-a-day world; and that marvel- 
ous old woman, his grandmother, of whom it 
has been said that "she has the values of a

What of the Poles? Without a national gov- 
ernment for decades, victims of countless cruel 
and ingenious devices planned to make them 
despair of ever again having such a govern- 
ment, much of their best blood scattered 
abroad by emigration, yet Poland on its own 
old territorial grounds is more numerous, 
richer, and abler than it ever was. Mr. Gib-

The situation in the Near East, including 
not only the Balkan States but also Turkey 
and Italy, Mr. Gibbons treats authoritatively, 
pointing out the fundamental bases of a just

ica for American citizenship; safeguard China; 
hold the Pacific; elevate public morality; purify 
government, in a word Americanize America, 
and this ever with renewed hope thanking God 
for the wisdom and power to fight for the honor 
and integrity of the nation. 



Published by The Bancroft Co., New York 

A novel by Griffing Bancroft, illustrating the 
incompatibility, and danger to the republic, of two 
progressive races occupying the same field. The 
author, a son of Hubert Howe Bancroft, is a grad- 
uate of Harvard, admitted to practise law. Pre- 
ferring life in the open, he developed a 1000-acre 
fruit farm at San Diego, California, specializing in 
olives. This, his first book, opens for him a new 
career. Living amidst such scenes as he depicts, 
with the threatened evils of political hybridism 
ever before him, he nevertheless holds himself 
well in hand, and in clear logical sequence weaves 
problem and performance into fascinating story 
with remarkable mental equipoise and fairness.

The E,ditor 

it a weekly magazine for writers 

It is twenty-two years old. Those who conduct it 
like to think of it M a weekly visitor to ambitious 
writers, as a visitor who must not be pretentious, 
not dull, but friendly and helpful. Recompiling that 
writinir may be an art. or a trade, or a profession 
what the writer himself makes it THE EDITOR 
tries to tell writers, so far as such things may be 
taught, how to write stories, articles, verses and 
plays, etc. One thins it does, in a way that never 
has been equalled, is to bring to the attention of 
writers news of all the opportunities to sell their 
work. News of current price competitions is a 
weekly feature. Editorials on copyright and authors' 
literary property rights are frequent. 

P. C. Macfarlane says that THE EDITOR'S lead- 
ing articles, which usually are written by Charles 
Leonard Moore, are the best essays on writing being 
published today. 

THE EDITOR has a department devoted to let- 
ters in which successful contemporary writers tell 
of the genesis, development and writing of certain 
of their published stories. 

A yearly subscription (52 weekly numbers) costs 
$3.00. A* four months' trial subscription costs $1.00. 
Single copies are 10 eta. each.

according to the British Relief Society, 
are the families of professional men. 
These include the families of the men 
of arts and letters. Usually well-born, 
accustomed to advantages of human 
civilization, they frequently find them- 
selves in want, when the head of the 
house is summoned to the colors or 
killed in action. 

The Authors' League Fund cares 
for such cases. The interests of these 
innocent sufferers are more closely 
allied to yours than any others. Will 
you send a contribution for their 
Relief?

Just imagine 
A lovable, devil-may-care 

Irish artist 
44 years young 

And his very much grown up son 
23 years old 

And what happens -when 
They both fall in love -with 
The Girl in the Gold Brocade 



A charmingly whimsical 
story of studio life with its ups 
and downs of affluence and 
pawntickets, and a romantic 
adventure among the woods 
and hills and rivers in search 
of the Isle of Delight. 

Kenny lives under the spell 
of Irish fairies and he]sprinkles 
some of their Stardust over 
you as you read the story.

Vol. XIII, General Index 



Here are the myths and legends of all the world, the tales in which the primitive 
peoples embodied their beliefs of the nature of the universe and the mysterious powers 
that rule it. Here are hundreds of stories for story lovers, and here is matter for the 
critical delight of the scholar. Also, here is a treat for the bibliophile. 

The volumes may be read separately, or used as an encyclopaedia of mythology. Vol. 
XIII, the General Index, co-ordinates them as a work of reference. The authors are 
recognized authorities; the editing has been planned to avoid fruitless duplication of mat- 
ter, and to combine with scholarly fulness and exactness the lifegiving qualities of literary 
style. Critics both popular and technical praise it. 

The books are bound plainly with no lettering but the titles, in gold on the backbone ; 
and durably, in cloth of a rich brown. Gilt tops. Pages 6}4x9^j, type bed 4^x6j^. 
Headbands and backing stout but not stiff. About 400 pages to the volume; fine paper; 
large, clear type; copiously and artistically illustrated. A treasure for public libraries; a 
prize for the private collection; a necessity for the student. 

Note The papers made for this first edition are expensive and of superior quality. With the costs 
of paper so greatly in excess of what they were when we placed our paper orders, it is quite probable 
that on our next edition we shall be obliged to use papers not so exceptionally good as these. Maybe 
we shall pay even more for them. Orders received now will be filled from the first printing; a positive 
gain to those who subscribe early. 

Per vol. $6 ; $78 the set

Psychoanalysis, the New Psychology 

Moffat, Yard and Company are recognized as the leading publishers of books relating to 
the progress and development of psychoanalysis. The three books listed below are 
widely used by educators, and have become standard of their class. 



DR. C. G. JUNG'S 

"Psychology 
of the Unconscious" 

Authorized Translation by 
Beatrice M. Hinkle, M.D. 

A study of the transforma- 
tions and symbolisms of the 
Libido. This remarkable work 
does for psychology what the 
theory of evolution did for 
biology, and promises an 
equally profound change in 
the thought of mankind. It 
Is an outgrowth of the meth- 
od of psychoanalysis first de- 
veloped by Freud, whereby 
the unconscious minds of In- 
dividuals were subjected to 
analysis.

DR. OSKAR PFISTER'S 
"The Psychoanalytic Method" 

Translation by Charles Rock- 
well Payne, M.D., with In- 
troductions by Dr. Sigmund 
Freud and G. Stanley Hall. 
Psychoanalysis, its study 
and especially its practical 
application, has been until 
now almost exclusively con- 
fined in this country to the 
medical profession. The pres- 
ent volume Introduces the 
new science to the layman 
and educator as well. It con- 
tains a complete historical 
sketch of the origin and de- 
velopment of psychoanalysis, 
with an abundance of case- 
histories from Dr. Pflster's 
own practice.

DR. ISADOR H. CORIAT'S 
" Abnormal Psychology " 

This work, which is writ- 
ten In popular language, 
though from the standpoint of 
pure science, is a work of 
highly original method and 
contents. The author gives 
his valuable researches on 
diseases of the memory, sleep, 
hypnosis and colored hearing. 
The important subject of psy- 
choanalysis and the newer re- 
searches on dream psychol- 
ogy, are also discussed, like- 
wise the methods devised 
through psychoanalysis for 
the prevention of the neuroses.

THE NEW SEPTEMBER BOOKS 








Ham tin Garland's New Novel 




A Son of the Middle Border 






"An Autobiography that ranks with the very greatest in literature." 






William Dean Howells 






The simple homely story of the American Pioneer is told in this book. It is a 






tale of courage and of vision, setting forth with a wealth of intimate detail the daily 






lives of a typical American family on the Western frontier in the generation follow- 






ing the Civil War. Isabel and Richard Garland face many a privation and hardship 






but through it all they keep their faith and see, for the most part, the glory of their 






great adventure. The narrative of their experiences of the things which they suffer 






and enjoy is a human document of rare and permanent interest, the central charac- 






ters of which are figures of national significance.

A Plea for Shorter Novels 



Swollen novels, like swollen fortunes, 
have come to be a good deal of a nuisance. 
We read too much, just as we eat too 
much our fiction is too long, just as our 
dinners are too heavy. 

The cause of the swollen novel is dis- 
closed in part by an anonymous English 
essayist who has been tracing the develop- 
ment of long-form fiction through the past 
century. His attack is chiefly against the 
conventional paraphernalia of novel-mon- 
gering when employed by second-rate 
hands, and he sets forth some principles 
of his own to replace a perfunctory and 
worn-out service; yet almost as much that 
is objectionable crops out in the ideals he 
holds up as in the practices he condemns. 

The point of departure is Samuel But- 
ler, author of that exceptional novel, "The 
Way of All Flesh" a good citation and 
a timely. Butler, it is maintained, has 
pointed out better than any other novelist 
the right way to the novel, has better ex- 
pressed the law of its being. That law 
appears to be this: the novelist should 
use the story as a means of talking about 
all that interests him most, and about noth- 
ing that does not interest him. Construc- 
tion, in a novel, is not the art of exciting 
by means of the connection of incident 
with incident: it is the art of leaving out, 
without incoherence, all that does not 
interest the writer and of putting in all 
that does. Dostoevsky expressed nothing 
but his own intense interests; Jane Austen 
saw that a plot should be to the novelist 
a means of expressing his own interests, 
not of trying to interest his readers. Stiff 
doctrine, this, and unpalatable to the arri- 
viste; yet the intending novelist is urged 
to learn from such authors, so actuated, 
rather than from the competent hacks 
whose works, by the time they are ten 
years old, seem but a mass of stale con- 
trivance. 



Real art, the writer goes on, repeti- 
tiously, consists not in telling a story, but 
in finding one which you can use to tell 
what interests you, and that only. To dis- 
cover the nature of your own interest in 
life, to ascertain what you know about 
human beings, and to express that in the 
form of a story, such is the task of the 
novelist. You may do what you like with 
your plot provided you get your own inter- 
est, your own knowledge, into it. The 
history of the novel through the past 
hundred years is incoherent, because our 
novelists have not, consciously and with 
increasing determination, set themselves 
to the task. 

Interest yourself; express your inter- 
est. 

All amateurs do so; and that, finally, 
"is why amateurs have had such astonish- 
ing success with the novel." 

Well, it might be maintained that all 
novelists at least near the beginning 
are amateurs; indeed, it might be asserted 
that the art of novel-writing, through lack 
of instruction and of a body of systematic 
rules to govern practice, is the amateur's 
art par excellence. The amateur has more 
enthusiasm (or "interest") than discipline; 
and lack of discipline makes for diffuse- 
ness and formlessness. These two have 
always been the capital defects of the Eng- 
lish novel, and even such modern British 
practitioners as have lived in France and 
have studied their art there have not al- 
ways been able to leave behind them that 
slackness which is one of their racial 
characteristics. The loose-tongued, self- 
indulgent Englishman chats, sprawls, goes 
quite ungirt; and the essayist of the Lon- 
don "Times" finds justification and indul- 
gence for him. 

Of course the cardinal point of "inter- 
est" remains quite unshaken, if we are 
dealing with the artist and not with the 



140 



THE DIAL 



[August 30 



mere purveyor. Yet even the artist, 
though he has chosen his theme on the 
basis of "interest," must sometimes exe- 
cute longueurs or face the scene-a-faire 
just as the portrait-painter, for example, 
must sometimes reconcile himself to giving 
about so many square feet of dull, drab 
background. The essential difference is, 
of course, that the canvas is seen at a 
glance, with its longueurs automatically 
subordinated or ignored, while the novel is 
usually (or sometimes) taken page by 
page, as the pages run, with the arid tracts 
in complete evidence. Now and then 
appears an author who will banish the 
drab and the arid; every page must 
sparkle, every paragraph must aid the 
grand elan: the result is the fidgeting 
rapidity of "Candide" or of the "Dolly 
Dialogues." Any style is permissible save 
the ennuyeux yet even the most rapid and 
brilliant style becomes a weariness if it 
represents too long and systematic an eva- 
sion. 

"Interest" is, of course, but another 
form of confidence. They are the two 
sides of one shield. The author who says, 
"I have enough interest in this topic to 
develop it in extenso and full confidence in 
my ability to hold my reader's attention 
through all my amplifications and wander- 
ings," is doubly armed. To confidence 
coupled with industry is due about nine- 
tenths of "Clayhanger." You are carried 
on by the author's absorption in his sub- 
ject and by his serene assumption that he 
can carry you on. "Skip?" exclaimed a 
reader in the midst of Mr. Bennett's great 
trilogy; "where can you skip to?" And 
indeed you are on a wide prairie that 
makes its own horizon, and there is noth- 
ing to do but trudge ahead. 

The novel is expected to have at least 
75,000 words. One of 90,000 is still of 
moderate length. One of 125,000 may be 
taxed with embonpoint. One of 150,000 
or more unless the words are demon- 
strably necessary may fairly be pro- 
nounced gross. I recall the instance of a 
novelist who wrote half a million words, 
from which to cull 125,000 for his volume. 
Even if one has no reason to complain 
of the result, he has a good right to pro- 



test against the process. That indicates 
a lack of self-discipline such as threatens 
to lead on almost to a disintegration of 
mental fibre. Surely, a man should know 
what he is after, and should go after it 
straight. The long novel too often sug- 
gests the unpacked trunk the contents 
have never been compactly brought to- 
gether at all, but are spread loosely, and 
often at random, over bed, chairs, and 
floor. If one's material is to take the 
journey to other lands, or to posterity, or 
even through the day's market, it ought to 
be packed in for the trip. It must have 
compression and the form that ensues. 
Compressed form is itself one of the mani- 
festations of force an evidence of vigor. 
The novel of to-day should be required 
to bant. I believe that a novelist can say 
his say in 60,000 words, or even in 
50,000. I believe that in 50,000 words, 
properly packed, he can even cover long 
periods of time and can handle adequately 
a large number of individuals and of 
family groups. Much of the accepted 
apparatus must, of course, be thrown into 
the discard. I would be indulgent toward 
the preliminary exposition, but not far be- 
yond it. One should rule out long descrip- 
tions of persons such things are nugatory 
and vain: with your best effort the reader 
sees only what he has seen, and figures 
your personage on the basis of his own 
experience and recollection. One must 
abolish set descriptions of places, unless 
unique, remote, unfamiliar; for the world, 
in these days of easy travel and abundant 
depiction, has come to know itself pretty 
well. One will banish all "conversation," 
whatever its vraisemblance to life, if it 
merely fills the page without illuminating 
it. I would sweep away, as would the 
writer I am commenting upon, all labor- 
ious effort on stuff that is dragged in 
because someone will think it "ought to 
be there" cliches, conventional scenes and 
situations. To prevent sprawl and form- 
lessness I favor a division into "books," 
and a division of the books into sections. 
Thus articulation and proportion will be 
secured, as in the case of an architectural 
order; and one will be better able to down 
the rising head of verbosity.

"Real art" does not consist in finding 
a story in which you can tell what interests 
you, and that only. Such a step indeed 
makes an advantageous preliminary, and 
may free one in advance from some of 
the botherations lying in wait reluctant 
love passages, repellent sex-discussions, 
scenes of violence and bloodshed with 
which one may have no proper affinity, 
indelicate "close-ups" which explore and 
exploit poor humanity beyond the just 
bounds of decorum, and such like. "Real 
art" is, and will remain, largely a matter 



of form, of organism, of definition, of 
boundaries. The artist will express his 
"interest" heaven forbid that he should 
not; but it must be an interest disciplined 
by, and within, metes and bounds, an in- 
terest which shall result in a unified im- 
pression that depends much upon the 
time-element and on the simple counting 
of words. Words sometimes darken coun- 
sel; and too many of them may becloud 
and even wreck artistic intention. 



HENRY B. FULLER. 



William James 



Europe knows at present but one Ameri- 
can philosopher. This is William James. 
And Europe knows him as the American 
philosopher, because in the most intimate 
and specific way, he is the philosopher of 
America. In the history of philosophy, 
there are always two streams of ten- 
dency which cross each other and in- 
terpenetrate often but never remain 
coincident throughout their course. The 
first and more fundamental is the spon- 
taneous envisagement of the world and 
of man, the vision of the place of man 
in nature and of his destiny under the as- 
pect of eternity. The second is largely 
commentary on the first. The first is com- 
posed of theories of life, rooting deep in 
the experiences and adventures of man- 
kind. The second is essentially a pedan- 
try which elaborates, in the manner of 
the professor, the implications of the first 
and carries it to the limit of logical re- 
finement, until it is displaced by a fresh 
vision at the hands of a fresh thinker. 
Most philosophy in America has been sec- 
ondary, professorial, irrelevant to the 
actual course of life and thought in this 
country. Its roots lay in a tradition which 
the circumstances of life rejected and 
which the adventure of living falsified. 
This tradition is that of Calvinism. Calvin 
had a vision which infected great groups 
of European people. The light of that 
vision led them to undergo many hardships 
and to undertake many difficulties. For 
one it drove a company of them to con- 



tinental North America. It was the urge 
within the heart of the Puritan pioneers, 
of the Pilgrim Fathers. It helped them to 
fight the wilds in nature and in man, to 
build their community, and to order their 
lives. It was an intense thing and it was 
a learned thing. The wilds of nature, 
however, rejected the sophistications of 
learning; they required strength of body 
and sincerity of soul. The Calvinist tra- 
dition hence became mitigated under the 
stress of the conflict between man and na- 
ture which necessitated the belief in neigh- 
borly good will, in human initiative, in 
continual trustworthiness, in responsibil- 
ity, and in freedom. What the Calvinist 
brought to America and what he there 
learned were opposites. The life of 
America consequently flowed away from 
Calvinism into other courses. Its role was 
changed from the dynamic organization of 
an emotion into the skeleton of an idea. 
It became the preoccupation of the school- 
man, thin in utterance, vaguely optimistic 
in sentiment, and completely irrelevant to 
the problems of life and living. From 
Jonathan Edwards to Josiah Royce, it 
retained this character. Even in Emer- 
son, it failed to come to close grips with 
the realities with which human life in 
America was dealing. 

That life flowed on, pioneer. It was 
positive, even in its superstitions and over-

beliefs, whether these be Mormonism or 
Christian Science, or the undiscriminating 
good-fellowship of Walt Whitman. In its 
higher reaches it was cheerful, humorous, 
experimental, with faith in its own power; 
adventurous without being romantic, pious 
without ceasing to be essentially human- 
istic. It was the spirit that trekked across 
the American continent, that mined the 
gold, that fought the Civil War, that built 
the railways, that converted a wilderness 
into a civilization. It is forward-looking, 
industrious, democratic. It is the spirit 
of the industrial democracy of Europe as 
well, but without the hampering past of 
mankind in Europe. It is the spirit of the 
rising masses of Europe, confronting, not 
a conflict with the repressive machinery of 
a caste-hardened social order, but virgin 
Nature, and building a new and freer civ- 
ilization of her substance. It is this spirit 
which the philosophy of William James 
expresses. And it is for this reason that 
his vogue in Europe is proportional to his 
articulate visioning of the unconscious 
guiding forces in the life and hopes of 
America. His philosophy is a theory of 
life, not made in the schools but gathered 
through deep sympathy with the hearts of 
men whose beating his own responded to, 
the wide world over. 

For significantly enough, though James 
was an American thinker, his training was 
very far from American. The parental 
household in which he spent his childhood 
was that of a Swedenborgian clergyman 
whose concrete spiritism made a lasting 
modification of James's mind. His youth 
was spent in schools in French Switzer- 
land, in France itself, and in England. 
He studied painting with Holman Hunt, 
and nature with Louis Agassiz. He was 
in succession a painter, a physician, a 
physiologist, a psychologist, and a philoso- 
pher. After 1872 he was one of the best 
known members of the Harvard faculty. 

His theory of life is technically known 
as Pragmatism. He got the word from 
Charles Peirce, and he called it himself a 
new name for an old way of thinking. 
But this old way of thinking might as well 
have been called Americanism, for it is 
substantially the perception of the nature 



and destiny of man when human life is 
apprehended at its fighting weight, and its 
form and go come under direct observa- 
tion. What then appears is mankind 
struggling for survival in a world which 
was not made for it but in which it grew. 
This world is characterized by a grow- 
ing diversity and manyness. Not only are 
man and all living things seeking to win a 
livelihood at the risk of their lives, but in- 
animate nature itself is composed of mul- 
titudes, each one of which has a character, 
an idiosyncrasy and selfhood, the destruc- 
tion of which it resists and the conserva- 
tion of which seems to be the endeavor of 
its existence. Each thing in this world is 
autonomous and self-governed. It exists 
with other things only in so far as it has 
succeeded in making an adjustment to 
them, only in so far as it has succeeded in 
establishing, in a word, certain habits and 
forms of interaction, which make up the 
actual unities of the world we live in and 
know. All these unities are not primary but 
secondary. They are habits of behaving 
which things develop toward each other in 
order that thev may be together at all. 
We call them ' laws of nature," but even 
the most fundamental of the laws of nat- 
ure are no more. The laws of mechanics, 
of thermodynamics, of chemistry they 
also change, evolve, accommodate. There 
was a time when they were not, and there 
will be a time when they shall not be. 
What in truth characterizes the world as 
a whole is the fact that all of its parts are 
constantly undergoing mutations muta- 
tions sometimes compelled from without, 
and always arising from within. All the 
items in the world are changing items 
novelties keep constantly emerging and 
they either succeed in winning a place for 
themselves in the cosmos or disappear. 
The cosmos itself is like a team of in- 
dividuals who have attained to a certain 
mode of being and acting together. It is 
a happening, not an eternal form, and its 
unity is contingent upon the assent, the 
formed habits, of its constituents. 

In this cosmos, man has happened, an 
infinitesimal scrap in an infinite universe. 
He is no more central to the world than 
any other thing, not even the gods. For 



1917] 



THE DIAL

gods there may be, differing in kind and 
in individuality just as there are men, and 
having qualities of consciousness with 
which religious experience suggests men 
may come into touch and be helped or 
frustrated. These gods also may be part 
of the cosmic team. They also, if they 
are, must undergo change, must struggle 
for survival, must work together with 
men and things for the maintenance of the 
ordered world, in an environment which 
is infinitude. 

Working, consequently, successful 
working, is the test. Men and thoughts 
and things are not born good, they make 
good. It is becoming, not being, that 
counts. All the organs and capacities of 
man must be strong to maintain them- 
selves and to do their appropriate share 
in maintaining the organism of which they 
are parts, if they and it are to survive. 
Ideas, opinions, hypotheses, arising no 
matter how, all start really on the same 
level. Each involves, at the outset, an 
act of faith, a willingness to believe in 
the prosperity of its guidance, a willing- 
ness, consequently, to take the risk of 
failure that is likely as not to come by 
following its guidance. Each has to be 
set to work to win its way in the control 
of that aspect of the world or of experi- 
ence which it intends or designates. Each 
is true or false, not primarily but eventu- 
ally, as it succeeds or fails in winning this 
control. It follows that it is unwise as 
well as unjust to rule out, a priori, any 
hypothesis, any way of thinking, which as 
it appears makes a claim to truth. The 
right, the scientific action is to give it a 
chance to make good its claim. No matter 
what an idea may be, it must be tested, 
so far as possible, experimentally. 
Whether it be the conception of human 
survival after death, or of the character 
of divinity, or the power of the mind to 
heal, it must not be rejected a priori. 
There is a dogmatism and intolerance of 
science which can be quite as vicious as the 
dogmatism and intolerance of religion. 
The important thing, in this changing 
world, is the democratic equality of op- 
portunity to make good for ideas as well 
as for men. That is really the only in- 



dispensable assumption of scientific meth- 
od, and Pragmatism is a theory of scien- 
tific method. 

James's thinking was impregnated and 
fertilized through and through by this as- 
sumption. His associations of childhood 
and his youthful training had given him 
the power of sympathetic insight into the 
motives and bases for the great variety of 
human demands, both superstitious and 
intelligent. Lover of peace and inter- 
nationalist as he was, he had sympathy 
even for the instincts which find expres- 
sion in war, and his proposal of a moral 
equivalent for it is one of the great docu- 
ments in the history of the socialization of 
mankind. 

If one were to sum up in a single phrase 
James's attitude toward the world and to- 
ward human life, one might call it that of 
metaphysical democracy. His sense for 
individuality in things, his sense for the 
right of things to their individuality stands 
out in all of his philosophical writing: that 
is really all that is implied in the meta- 
physics he has called "radical empiricism" ; 
that is really all that is implied in the 
method he has named Pragmatism. In 
ethics, of course, he was a humanist to 
that degree that nothing human, even the 
most remote and fanciful of human things, 
was alien to him. He acknowledged the 
claim of each and asked for each an op- 
portunity to justify itself by its works. 
That is the tenor of the collection of es- 
says headed by the famous one on "The 
Will to Believe" (1897), and the "Talks 
to Teachers," etc. (1899). That is the as- 
sumption underlying his great two-volume 
"Psychology" (1892), his -"Pragma- 
tism" (1907), his "A Pluralistic Uni- 
verse" (1909), his posthumous "Some 
Problems in Philosophy" (1911), the 
various essays in "Radical Empiricism" 
(1912), his study in the "Varieties of Re- 
ligious Experience" ( 1902) . In his think- 
ing what was fundamental and what was 
best as well as what was most hopeful and 
most fresh in the life of America and in 
the life of Western civilization as a whole 
found its first free articulate philosophic 
expression.

Literary Affairs in London 

(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 
The literary critic in London is beginning 
nowadays to feel what old soldiers felt when 
the Prince de Conde or it may have been 
Turenne undertook and carried out his classical 
winter campaign. They objected with justice 
that if this innovation were to take root, the 
soldier would get no rest and the leisurely indus- 
try of warfare would grow distasteful to persons 
of a quiet habit. And since Mr. Hall Caine and 
Miss Marie Corelli led their victorious thou- 
sands into the middle of the slack season, the 
old routine of the year has been broken up and 
the critic has been robbed of his rest in the hot 
weather. 

A scattered fire of volumes of all sorts has 
come from all the presses during the summer. 
Poetry continues most amazingly to flourish. In- 
telligent prophets predict darkly that it will pres- 
ently altogether oust the novel, which, they say, 
is rapidly dying. But to me, at least, the mod- 
ern novel seems quite sufficiently alive. Look at 
the younger men and women who are writing it 
in England to-day D. H. Lawrence, Gilbert 
Cannan, Francis Brett Young, Ford Madox 
Hueffer, Christopher Stone, John Palmer, Frank 
Swinnerton, Viola Meynell, Sylvia Lynd. . . 
I am not an enraptured reader of the works of all 
I have mentioned ; I even wish that some of them 
would stop writing. But their color, their live- 
liness, their observation, and their sense of lan- 
guage are incontestable. It will go hard with 
us if we do not carry the English novel a few 
steps further in this generation than it has hith- 
erto gone save in two or three very exceptional 
books. 

The Victorian novel was always like a length 
of cloth cut off a roll. But the ambition of the 
present century is to make it a complete, rounded, 
and orderly form, which shall leave one definite 
impression, and not a multitude of impressions, 
on the mind of the reader. The prose story 
tends to be a sprawling thing ; it was in its origins 
the child of "Le Grand Cyrus" by Richardson's 
Pamela. Heredity has seemed to curse it; but 
it shows many signs now of escaping from orig- 
inal sin. One of the authors I have named, 
Mr. Frank Swinnerton, has just produced a 
most remarkable piece of work, called "Noc- 
turne." I cannot rid myself of the conviction 
that he did it for a bet; but he has written a 
beautiful, brilliant, and moving book. The 



events which it describes take place within the 
compass of a single night, from about six o'clock 
in the evening to two or three in the following 
morning. There are six speaking characters 
Emmy, the housekeeping and dull sister; Jenny, 
the adventurous sister who works "in the millin- 
ery"; their paralytic "Pa"; Alf, a young man, 
the rejected lover of Jenny and the accepted 
suitor of Emmy; Keith, Jenny's sailor lover; 
and a chauffeur. But the story is not, as one 
would imagine, overburdened with psychology or 
retrospective enquiries into the past careers of 
these persons; nor is it a turmoil of overcrowded 
adventures. The characters are exquisitely and 
exactly drawn, each modelled and rounded into 
a complete semblance of life. The book is not 
padded out by unrelenting insistence on the 
squalid vulgarity of the setting. The scene is 
transformed as if by a rich light by Jenny's pas- 
sionate and adventurous nature. Emmy, who 
might have been a scolding drudge, is observed 
so lovingly and with so much pity as to make 
her acceptance of Alf touching and beautiful. 
Even that solid and practical young man who, 
rebuffed by Jenny, approaches Emmy with a 
sad story of his landlady's cooking, becomes lik- 
able under the play of Mr. Swinnerton's humor. 
"Pa" might very well have been horrible with 
his paralysis, his senile childishness, and his hun- 
ger and thirst for "bready-butter pudding" and 
the evening dole of beer. The point of intense 
light in the story, round which the whole com- 
position is grouped, is the love of Jenny and 
Keith. 

The scene on the yacht in which they declare 
their love is one of the most beautiful in recent 
literature. But it is not isolated. This book, 
from its most workaday humor to its most mov- 
ing situation, is one piece, attaining unity by 
an unvarying truth of observation and candor 
and coolness of exposition. Yet of what vulgar 
materials it is made, is it not slatternly, grum- 
bling Emmy, pert, selfish, and eventually im- 
moral Jenny, the horrible, senile father. . . 
But since Mr. Swinnerton can make these things 
beautiful to us and yet leave them real, they 
must, perhaps, be beautiful in themselves. We 
may therefore hope for more novels like Mr. 
Swinnerton's, since his appears not to have been 
a fluke. 

It may be that the novel is learning from 
poetry, since poetry has become popular again. 
Lyric verse dare not sprawl ; and the growing 
public liking for it may indicate, or may be de- 
veloping as a by-product, a taste for compact 



1917]

and workman-like things. However this may be, 
it is certain that verse is beginning to share in 
a kingdom hitherto reserved for the novel. The 
fact that much indifferent or even nauseous verse 
is being written and read is in reality an excel- 
lent sign. Let the public get accustomed to 
metre and rhyme and the poets will do the rest. 
Besides, there is always the lucky chance that 
the public will like the right thing for the 
wrong reasons, or in a state of vagueness as to 
its reasons, or because it is bullied into liking it. 
It does not much matter, so long as contributions 
are made to the support of deserving young ar- 
tists. And it will be good for the poets to be 
in touch, however suspiciously or disdainfully, 
with a wide audience. 

Some of them are beginning to show unmis- 
takable signs of this influence. Mr. Harold 
Monro, who took a conspicuous part in the 
movement by founding the Poetry Bookshop, 
used to be a singularly dull and insipid writer. 
But about three years ago he began suddenly 
to be fresh and interesting, and he has continued 
to improve ever since. He is not yet fully in 
command of his own temperament ; he really does 
not know when he is being individual and when 
he is being merely silly. His new book, "Strange 
Meetings," is a collection of verses, which change 
abruptly from being moving and piercing to be- 
ing clumsy and inept. Imagine the state of 
mind of a man who can write: 

The stars must make an awful noise 
in whirling round the sky. 

Yes; but what of him when he writes: 

A flower is looking through the ground 
Blinking at the April weather; 

Now a child has seen the flower: 
Now they go and play together. 

Now it seems the flower will speak, 
And will call the child its brother 

But, oh strange forgetfulness! 

They don't recognize each other. 
Mr. Monro writes poetry very much as people 
walk in their sleep. He gets sometimes into 
the most ridiculous places and does the most 
ludicrous things ; but sometimes his somnambulis- 
tic mood leads him with astonishing exactness. If 
one were to wake him but criticism will not 
do this he might become again a writer of 
tediously lucid poems about socialism and over- 
feeding and God. As it is, he is one of the 
strangest and most mysterious of poets. There 
is no use in exhorting him. We sit patiently 
and wait what his shifting moods may produce. 



Mr. Francis Brett Young, whom I mentioned 
earlier in this letter as a novelist, has recently 
appeared as a poet of a sort directly opposite 
to Mr. Monro. He was a serious and conscien- 
tious novelist; he is a serious and conscientious 
poet. He does not go sleepwalking after poetry; 
he sits down and thinks about it earnestly. But 
the result is extremely satisfying. There is 
nothing flimsy in what he writes; and if he is 
a little clumsy and a little stilted, these defects 
are obviously attendant on his chief quality, 
which is intellectual power. How rare but how 
splendid a gift in a poet! I do not think any- 
one will be vastly thrilled by his book. I can- 
not imagine schwarmerisch young ladies looking 
off his pages and dreaming away into inanity, 
as they are said to do with Mr. Alfred Noyes. 
But grown men, whose minds have grown equally 
with their sensual perceptions, will find that Mr. 
Young feeds the intellectual as well as the emo- 
tional appetite. His poem "Testament" is a very 
moving and satisfying piece of work. The author 
has been campaigning in East Africa and he 
writes : 

If I had died and never seen the dawn 
For which I hardly hoped, lighting this lawn 
Of silvery grasses ; if there had been no light 
And last night merged into perpetual night; 
I doubt if I should ever have been content 
To have closed my eyes without some testament 
To the great benefits that marked my faring 
Through the sweet world. 

And the poem proceeds with a sober but lovely 
catalogue of good things friendship, argument, 
and love. Mr. Young admits that his verse 
is a by-product of his prose; and it seems un- 
likely that he will ever write very much of it. 
His utterance seems rather difficult; but he has 
a solidity which is not found too often in mod- 
ern poetry and which makes his book, "Five 
Degrees South," remarkable. 

I have another new poet before me as I write, 
whom I feel a little doubtful about mentioning. 
Mr. Robert Nichols is still very immature and 
his "Ardours and Endurances" has a great many 
of the defects of youth. But he has a singular 
luxuriance of temperament which promises well. 
I feel rather as one might feel with a young 
relative a little timid of mentioning his per- 
formances outside the household. I will confine 
myself to saying that we think we have here a 
writer whose work may very well make a great 
impression in a short time.

A Frustrated Prophet of Pacifism 

HERBERT SPENCER. By Hugh Elliot. (Henry 
Holt & Co; $2.) 

Mr. Hugh Elliot has produced a notable 
work, notable as a biography, notable in its cur- 
rent appeal, notable in the perspective it estab- 
lishes for viewing a remarkable intellectual 
career. It is notable also for the experience 
which prepared Mr. Elliot to write it. 

It has been my singular fortune (or fate) to have 
read through the whole of Spencer's works twice at 
an interval of fifteen years, and each time in the 
midst of a great war. The first reading in fact 
was carried out on active service on the South 
African veldt, where not infrequently I had little 
other baggage than a toothbrush and a volume of 
the "Principles of Psychology." There exists in the 
English language no more trenchant indictment of 
war and militarism than is contained in the "Study 
of Sociology." Yet it was my lot to read that work 
many miles from any inhabited town, in momentary 
expectation of an attack, and with revolver ready 
loaded in case of sudden need. . . Once again 
during the progress of a war, have I read Spencer's 
furious declamations against warlike and military 
activities. . . Yet still the thought arises, that, if 
Europe had followed Spencer, this war could never 
have occurred. . . The spirit of Treitschke has 
triumphed over the spirit of Spencer the meta- 
physics of Germany over the common sense of Eng- 
land. 

It is strange in how short a time the achieve- 
ments of Herbert Spencer should assume a ret- 
rospective interest. Even at the time of his 
death in 1903 the zenith of his fame had been 
passed; and foreign reviewers commented upon 
the indifference of England to his loss. His 
chief contributions had been so thoroughly ab- 
sorbed in the unparalleled acceleration of scien- 
tific thinking of which he was an initiator 
that the debt carried little sense of personal 
obligation. Many of his principles had become 
common knowledge, and his "highly original sug- 
gestions had degenerated into platitudes." The 
tone of his own comment upon his career is spir- 
itually as well as neurasthenically depressed : the 
devotee of authorship must be prepared for 
financial losses, for heavy penalties, for privations 
and denials of human pleasures, for disappoint- 
ment in the satisfactions of fame. 

Of Spencer's life and personality little need 
be restated to set the philosopher in his position 
twenty years after. His education was irregular 
and self-directed; he had no academic associa- 
tions; he was constitutionally idle and temper- 
amentally rebellious. He was coldly intellectual, 
strongly self-centred and self-contained, and 
emotionally barren. He avoided social relations 
beyond his control, and accepted the Athenaeum 



as his retreat, with music and billiards as diver- 
sions. He lived and wrote largely in boarding- 
houses, and in many ways reflected the bourgeois 
attitude of his neighbors. He accepted few pub- 
lic dinners or honors; he declined, while in this 
country, an attractive offer to lecture, saying that 
he had no desire to make a show of himself. His 
life was that of his books; "his works were much 
greater than himself; and all the best of him will 
be found in his philosophy." The formative fact 
of his modus vivendi was his neurasthenic state, 
doubtless aggravated by unwise yielding to its 
impositions and a prejudiced attitude to the 
proper care of his teeth. "He could not read 
Kant from the same mental peculiarity that he 
could not have a tooth extracted: in both cases 
a subtraction from his own personality was in- 
volved." Beginning his career as a civil engineer, 
he soon turned to the writing of books (issued 
largely at his own risk), setting forth his ideas 
and the foundations of his system. Legacies from 
relatives enabled him to survive the attendant 
losses; and the subscriptions of friends, to con- 
tinue the enterprise. American support helped 
him greatly. His eighteen volumes were, for the 
most part, dictated, and often the dictation was 
continued for a few minutes only at a time, the 
intervals being spent in restoring or easing the 
circulation in his brain. The limitations of au- 
thorship and of living for the neurasthenic 
(Spencer wore ear-pads to eliminate controver- 
sial conversation), and the consequences of sen- 
sitiveness in human relations, have rarely been 
more singularly expressed than in the "case" of 
Herbert Spencer. 

Of Spencer the biologist, the psychologist, the 
sociologist, the moralist, the philosopher, the 
writer on education and social institutions and 
reforms, it is Spencer the reformer whose work 
has endured unassailed. Spencer survives as the 
exponent of liberalism and the prophet of pac- 
ifism. Mr. Carnegie was moved to give his mil- 
lions for the cause of peace by the arguments of 
Spencer. It is still true, however, that this 
practical consequence of his views, though it 
stands out conspicuously in a twentieth-century 
estimate of his work, does not overshadow the 
intrinsic value of his thought and the type of his 
achievement. 

The mind of Spencer, like his character, \\.is 
a singular instrument. It needed but a few guid- 
ing principles for its direction. In the main 
these were two: Evolution for the view of the 
universe, and Liberty for the guidance of human 
affairs. These make the system in a gigantic. 



1917] 



THE DIAL

deductive unfoldment. Even the "Sociology," 
with its array of corroborative facts, was, in Mr. 
Elliot's opinion, only retroactively inductive. 
In his contribution to evolutionary theory Spen- 
cer was an anticipator as well as a pioneer, but 
he was an individualist even in that, the dis- 
tinctive nineteenth-century movement. The 
principle of increasing differentiation sufficed, and 
the inheritance of acquired characteristics (his 
chief error) was adequate to supply the material 
for variation and selection. "The truth is that 
Spencer had the makings of a fanatic, and herein 
lie both his strength and his weakness. The 
stream of thought in a fanatic is a narrow one. 
Nothing counts outside the province on which 
attention is concentrated." Within that province 
it is a magnet, picking up everything that such a 
magnet can hold. 

On the side of political affairs Spencer dis- 
tinguished between governments that govern 
much and those that govern little. The former 
subordinate the individual and in them wars are 
common; they are of the military type; in the 
others, peace is the rule, and they conform to the 
industrial type. The industrial has most of the 
virtues, the military most of the vices. The main 
virtue is great individual freedom. Spencer car- 
ried the doctrine of non-interference by the state 
to the extent of regarding it as a mistake for the 
government to have the postal monopoly, to reg- 
ulate measures of health, to enforce education or 
factory-laws. All that should be left to private 
enterprise and the fate of competition. Strongly 
positive philosophically and individualistic so- 
cially, Spencer's convictions (prepossessions in 
some aspects) made for simplicity of solution, 
and for the overstatement of what was a truth 
in moderation. When they were enunciated, his 
positions seemed much more tenable than they 
now appear. It is easy in our richer experience 
to see their inadequacy, their exaggeration; it 
is not so easy to appreciate their startling origin- 
ality and their remarkable independence of pre- 
vious schooling and thinking. 

It is intelligible that we should be less con- 
cerned in our radically reconstructed world with 
Spencer's "Synthetic Philosophy," his biology and 
psychology and ethics and metaphysics from all 
of which science has accepted what it could use 
than with his contributions to the understanding 
of social forces. So far as Spencer submits to 
classification, he was chiefly a sociologist. His 
foundations reflect the accepted principles of his 
time, reflect them with a limited acquaintance 
with their setting in previous thought and with 



a national as well as a temperamental insularity. 
His ethics is hedonistic; his psychology, associa- 
tional, in the limited English sense. In all these 
realms he has done his bit, sometimes with slight 
effect, sometimes with considerable profit. His 
most ambitious conception the Unknowable 
proved as negatively fruitful in thought as in 
expression. His psychological construction of the 
bond between reflex action and logical thinking 
stands as established. Similarly, his views of 
education the most popular of his contributions 
are still influential in the modern forms of 
emphasis on a return to nature, a fixed sense 
for logical value, and avoidance of formal scho- 
lasticism. The days of all-inclusive systems, 
sweeping the circle of the sciences with however 
modern a periscope, are over. They lasted from 
Aristotle to Spencer, and the last survey was 
worthy of its predecessors. The fertile thought 
that science is one remains; ethics and psychol- 
ogy, politics and sociology, even physics and 
biology, are held together by the unity of nature 
and the consistency of the mind's comprehension. 
Spencer's consistency, though not innocent of the 
quality of strain, is yet suggestive and sustained. 
As a sociologist Spencer attempted far more 
thoroughly than in any other domain to supply 
the data for directive views which, according to 
Mr. Elliot, were already firmly fixed in his con- 
victions. He surveys with much detail for 
the most part contributed by others the forms 
of society in primitive and imperfectly evolved 
communities. In his interpretations he carries 
his guiding principles with him. As Mr. Elliot 
pointedly remarks, he makes primitive philos- 
ophers miniature Spencers, and primitive myth- 
ologies miniature synthetic philosophies. Dealing 
in the main with primitive modes of thought and 
their later expansion such as his "ghost theory" 
of religion his central interest is fixed upon the 
social forces that determine the life of a people 
and the direction of its activities. He concludes 
that the largest distinction of social life is that 
between the organization of society for peace and 
its organization for war. And that distinction 
may stand with unexpected pertinence to-day. 
With deep antipathy te militarism, he sees in it 
the enemy of industrialism, which is the activity 
of peace. The case of Germany completely re- 
futes his conclusion, though this was not true of 
the Germany of his day. As in so many other 
relations, Spencer has confused the spirit and 
the background of endeavor with its formal ap- 
pearance. That has ever been a radical idol; in 
its extreme manifestation, the fanatic's fallacy.

[August 30 



Liberty comes forward as the redemption of 
mankind. But again citing Mr. Elliot liberty 
should not be a dogma (as to Spencer it fre- 
quently was), but "an atmosphere of social 
thought." In contrast Spencer's deduction in 
favor of the complete freedom of women as a 
consequence of his social philosophy is about to 
be realized by the cruel indirection of his much- 
hated war. 

Herbert Spencer under the test of the world 
war makes very different reading from Herbert 
Spencer as the calm occupation of a philosophic 
mind. He becomes prophetic not only of the 
pacifist doctrine (of which America is the most 
influential protagonist), but also of the recon- 
struction of thought with reference to social con- 
trol, which is to be our chief business after the 
war and that of the next generation. Spencerism 
will contribute to the responsible thinking and 
doing of the future, to the maintenance of con- 
fidence as well as to distrust of former errors. 
National philosophy is inevitably and properly 
dominant in revolutionary times. As between 
Nietzsche or Treitschke and Spencer, there is no 
hesitation in the Anglo-Saxon liberty-loving 
mind. It is a tribute to the sterling value of 
Spencer's Weltanschauung that it is congenial 
to an international formulation.

An American Humanist 

THE ASSAULT ON HUMANISM. By Paul Shorey. 
(The Atlantic Monthly Co.; 60 cts.) 

It is difficult to appreciate the admiration which 
the editor of the "Atlantic" feels for Professor 
Shorey's "eloquent defense of the classical tradi- 
tion." This little book is indeed, as Mr. Sedg- 
wick says in his preface initiating the "Atlantic 
Monographs," "sharp and glittering." But such 
adjectives are dubious praise for a partisan of 
humanist learning like the Chicago professor who 
has supposedly become saturated throughout a 
long and scholarly life with the immortal poise 
and mellowness of the classics. Not sharpness 
and glitter do we expect as fruits of such an 
intimacy, but those qualities of "lucid ration- 
ality and precision, their urbanity, their sanity, 
their common sense, their humanized and human- 
izing emancipation from 'primitive foolishness,' 
parochialism and fanaticism" which Professor 
Shorey claims for that Latin literature he is 
struggling to save. From his own writing, how- 
ever, these qualities are almost pretentiously 



absent. Nothing could be less urbane, less 
rational and precise, than this strident polemic. 
The book is an incoherent and angry jumble of 
appeals to classical authority, attacks on Mr. 
Flexner and the "new" psychologists, complaints 
that President Eliot and the other assaulters 
have ignored the arguments of Professor Shorey 
and his friends, and dark imputations against 
the "sullen jealousy" of those of us who are 
trying, he says, to "control American education 
with the political efficiency of Prussian autocracy 
and the fanatical intolerance of the French anti- 
clericalists." 

This shrillness of tone is not any mere sudden 
heightening of the emotional pitch. Crassness 
permeates the book like bad blood in a neurotic 
child. The professor's leading argument for the 
study of Latin is that it is an "almost indis- 
pensable form of mental discipline for the 
speakers of such a language as ours," and that, 
at its best, it ministers to "the final mastery of 
English for highest artistic and philosophical 
ends." Listen to a sentence from Professor 
Shorey's book, and judge for yourself the "men- 
tal discipline" and "mastery of English for high- 
est artistic ends" which may result from a long 
and studious "humanistic" life: 

"Its disintegrating and deliquating effect on 
the logical functions of young minds com- 
pelled to attack it without the protection of a 
gasmask is a thing imagination boggles at." 

This beautiful example of Professor Shorey's 
humanistic style refers to the literature of edu- 
cational psychology, of which he seems to have 
read only the crudest examples. Of the really 
fruitful and very recent work of Dewey, Hall, 
Terman, Cubberley, Hetherington, Wells, he is 
evidently as ignorant as he thinks his opponents 
are of his own arguments. The difference is 
that to ignore his case means only to ignore a 
priori speculation, while to ignore present-day 
educational psychologists is to ignore a serious 
and most suggestive effort toward objective and 
incontrovertible evidence. 

Here is another passage: 

"There is ample time for both science and 
Latin in a rationally constructed curriculum. 
There is not time for both and for the dementia 
praecox of premature preoccupation with pseudo- 
science. But real science is hard work, almost 
as hard as Latin ; while the science of the talking 
delegates of science is a soft snap." 

That second sentence must be read aloud to 
get its full barbarous flavor. What are we to 
<!<> with a mind that, in a defence of the cul-

THE DIAL 



149 



tural influence of the classics, talks about gas- 
masks, dementia praecox, and soft snaps? And 
in comparison with some of Professor Shorey's 
utterances, the slangy staleness of this passage 
is mild. 

Now it is exactly the argument of the 
advocates of the "modern school" that when even 
a lifelong exposure to the classical languages 
and literatures results in a mind so thoroughly 
uncultivated as Professor Shorey shows his own 
to be, it is a waste of time to continue these 
studies as an integral part of the education of 
American youth. Professor Shorey is only an 
extreme example of his class. No American 
thought, criticism, or literary art of any creative 
value whatever comes from these guardians of 
the classical tradition, who are given to ex- 
pressing themselves with an incoherence of 
thought and an insensitiveness to style that we 
should complain of in modern journalism. It is 
the lip-service to "the fair things of beauty" which 
our professors of literary studies render while 
they aridly betray them in work and thought that 
has earned the contempt of a younger genera- 
tion and driven literary studies into limbo. It 
is the custodians themselves who have done more 
than anyone else to discredit the classics. The 
true lovers have only the professors to blame and 
not those of us who have revolted at sterility. 

Professor Shorey thinks that the main issue 
is "the survival or the total suppression, in the 
comparatively small class of educated leaders who 
graduate from high schools and colleges, of the 
very conception of linguistic, literary and crit- 
ical discipline; of culture, taste and standards; 
of the historic sense itself; of some trained fac- 
ulty of appreciation and enjoyment of our rich 
heritage from the civilized past." This is gro- 
tesque. None of these values are now being 
acquired from literary studies in high schools 
and colleges by even "the comparatively small 
class of educated leaders." Our younger edu- 
cated leaders have found their intellectual heri- 
tage in the study of history, politics, and modern 
philosophy, not in the study of the Latin lan- 
guage or anything that flows mystically from it. 
Furthermore, not even the most furious "modern 
school" proposes to exclude the great ancient lit- 
eratures. In implying this, Professor Shorey is 
far more unfair to the modernist than any mod- 
ernist has been to him. Even the terrible Mr. 
Flexner distinctly admits into his "modern school" 
the best translations of the ancient classics for 
reading and enjoyment. Nobody intends to sup- 
press these great books. Nobody intends to sup- 



press "critical discipline, culture, taste and 
standards, the historic sense itself." The issue, 
however, is exactly as Mr. Flexner has stated 
it whether the study of the Latin and Greek 
languages automatically produces these desirable 
qualities. The contemporary verdict is emphat- 
ically that there is no discoverable relation be- 
tween linguistic studies and the attainment of 
a cultivated mind. 

As long as there are public libraries with Latin 
grammars, or as long as there are people who 
know and love Latin, the industrious child with 
a turn for it will have adequate opportunity to 
learn the language. Four school years of ef- 
fort to give heterogeneously endowed children 
even a smattering of Latin have proved in the 
American school to be sheer futility. Acquaint- 
ance with the old literatures, however, is still an 
essential part of education in taste. How is that 
acquaintance best to be obtained, through the 
opaque medium of a complex language and the 
child's own barbarous and halting translation, 
or through reading of the best translations, 
themselves finely tempered pieces of English 
prose? Which is more likely to bring "mastery 
of English for artistic ends," and the awaken- 
ing of the imagination to "things of beauty" and 
large ideas? Who has done more to make the 
classics known and felt by Americans, Professor 
Shorey with his polemics and his frantic struggles 
to keep Latin in the secondary school, or Gil- 
bert Murray with his translations of the Greek 
plays into exquisite English verse, which made 
possible those stirring performances that gave 
delight to thousands of modern Americans? 

If Professor Shorey were really a humanist, 
would he not be content to let the languages 
die, if the literatures could be kept so vitally 
with us, serving culture as they will in a modern 
school which treats them as literature and not 
as philology? But he is not really a humanist. 
He is a professor, angrily defending his lifelong 
business. He is a proprietor, protecting a vested 
interest. It seems to give him comfort that 
idealists in every age have tilted quixotically at 
what they called impractical and verbal forms 
of education. Our little system, he thinks, will 
also have its disillusionment. It is queer com- 
fort. For the more obvious and encouraging 
moral is that there have always been men of 
insight to struggle against the tradition and the 
Paul Shoreys of their day. This moral might 
only whet our ardor to make this "modern 
school" veritably the final coup. Now that the

a disservice in stirring the dead bones of this

Co.; 75 cts.) 

STRANGE MEETINGS. By Harold Monro. (The 

Poetry Bookshop ; Is.) 

PEACOCK PIE. By Walter de la Mare. (Henry 

Holt & Co.; $2.) 

If there is one respect in which contemporary 
English poetry is conspicuously and consistently 
superior to contemporary American poetry, it is in 
the lyric. While their more adventurous fellow- 
craftsmen in America have been experimenting, 
perhaps a little recklessly, with narrative, epic, 
and symphonic verse, and with bizarre arythmics 
and insoluble self-symbolisms of all sorts, the 
English poets, with one or two exceptions, have 
held more clearly to the lyric tradition. This is 
not the cause, as some appear to think, for either 
heartburnings or self-congratulations. Poetry 
is poetry no matter where or how it is written, 
art should not be regarded from a narrowly and 
selfishly national standpoint, and we should be 
as ready to applaud a foreign artist as an 
American. As a theory, this is of course a plati- 
tude; as a fact, it might in some quarters be 
regarded as an alarming novelty, or even treason. 
As a practice, moreover, it meets opposition 
because it demands the application of a high 
degree of fair-mindedness and intelligence. One 
must face, in all foreign art, a considerable 
divergence from one's own in temper and 
method; and face it with understanding. It is 
different, but is it necessarily inferior? 

These problems have been often raised in the 
last few years over the question as to the rela- 
tive merits of contemporary English and Ameri- 
can poetry. Foolish things have been said on 



both sides of the Atlantic, the patriotic instinct 
has been as vigorous and cloistral in "Poetry 
and Drama," of London, as in "Poetry," of Chi- 
cago. In general the failure has been one of 
understanding, aided in some cases by a disposi- 
tion to condemn, a priori, without consulting the 
evidence. It is encouraging to see signs that 
this attitude is breaking down. The fact that 
the whole poetic firmament is in such a state of 
chaos has of itself made it necessary for critics 
to discard easy traditional theories and employ 
methods a little more empirical. This has 
resulted in greater fairness to the individual 
it has even gone so far, at times, as to indicate 
complete anarchy, in which bad was as loudly 
acclaimed as good. The upshot, however, has 
been the establishment of a middle attitude of 
good-humored, first-hand analysis, toward foreign 
art as well as domestic. 

It is with this attitude that we should 
approach the work of Mr. Hodgson, Mr. de la 
Mare, and Mr. Monro. If we have developed 
a taste for work more racily American, more 
conspicuously of the place and moment, we may 
conceivably feel that we are stepping back two 
or three decades when we read, for example, 
the poems of Mr. Hodgson. We should not 
allow this to prevent our enjoyment of their 
unique charm and originality. Mr. Hodgson is 
that rarity in these times, a poet of very small 
production, and of production on a uniformly 
high level, a poet who had already earned a 
reputation before the printing of his first book. 
His range is not wide. A single tone dominates 
nearly all the twenty-five poems in. this book 
whether in the narrative lyrics, such as "The 
Bull," "Eve," "The Song of Honour," and "The 
Gipsy Girl," or in the simple lyrics, such as 
"Time, You Old Gipsy Man," and "Stupidity 
Street." The metrical variety is not great, the 
melody is always simple; but Mr. Hodgson 
possesses a genuine gift for modulation which 
carries him safely over inversions that to others 
would have proved fatal. If Mr. Hodgson's 
abilities stopped there, his verse would be 
charming, but empty; these are matters of the 
voice merely. But Mr. Hodgson's chief value 
lies rather in what he has to say. There are 
two arts in poetry: the art of precisely saying 
what one has in mind ; and, even more important 
(though less regarded), the art of excluding from 
one's conception all that is not of pure value. 
It is particularly in this latter respect that Mr. 
Hodgson excels. His mood is always perfectly 
clear; the terms by which he states it have a 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



151 



delicate and sweet precision. Seldom is there a 
waste idea, seldom a waste line. Mr. Hodgson 
does not, like many poets, have to take a 
running start, only to generate lyric speed when 
half way through the poem; neither does he 
exhaust himself altogether in the first stanza. 
On the contrary his poems have that clear 
certainty, from beginning to end, which consti- 
tutes excellence in art. This would of course 
be a dull perfection if it were not for the 
quality of cool magic which is woven every- 
where through Mr. Hodgson's work, varying 
all the way from the twinkle of whim, as in 
"Eve," to the graver tones of "The Song of 
Honour." In general, this magic is not so much 
the magic of beauty as the magic of unaffected 
truthfulness, vigorously phrased, naive, sin- 
cere. One feels little trace of artifice, even in 
so fluent a lyric as "Eve." And a large part of 
the effectiveness of "The Bull" is in its honest 
matter-of-factness. 

The most arresting feature of Mr. Hodgson's 
work, however, is the feature which is most 
likely to give radical Americans the impression 
that he is old-fashioned: the fact that though he 
is essentially a lyric poet (preferring a lyric which 
is narrative) he is none the less essentially 
objective, never, or seldom, speaking in his own 
voice, or developing, psychologically, any per- 
sonal or dramatic viewpoint. This is an 
attitude which predicates poetry as a something 
separate from our own tortuous lives, a some- 
thing additional, perfect in itself : a something to 
turn to for delight, which shall take us, not 
deeper into ourselves, but away from ourselves. 
This attitude adds to the charm of Mr. Hodg- 
son's work, but it is also, in a wider sense, a 
weakness. It means that the greater part of 
human experience must remain unexpressed by 
him. It means that his work, in spite of its 
realistic or objective method, is in the last 
analysis decorative rather than interpretative. 
Poetry of this sort is not a window through 
which one may see, but a picture hung on the 
wall. It aims by every means known to the art 
to combine aesthetic patterns which shall delight 
us with their color and texture; but it never 
strikes at us through our emotions. The pleasure 
it affords us is serene, cool, detached. Itself 
produced by no very intense emotional dis- 
turbance in the poet's brain (beyond the pathos 
of creation) it has in consequence no power to 
disturb the reader. It does not reach forward or 
backward in human experience. It is, in fact, 
all treble, and no bass. The darker chords of 



intellectual and emotional frustration which 
shake the centre of individuality itself, and which 
in the past have given us our greatest poetry, 
are here untroubled. In this respect Mr. Hodg- 
son, Mr. de la Mare, and the Imagists, antipodal 
as their methods are, all share essentially one 
purpose. 

The work of Mr. Monro is from this stand- 
point the direct antithesis of Mr. Hodgson's 
work. Mr. Monro is, if the expression may 
be used, a psychological realist. If he is by no 
means the equal of Mr. Hodgson in point of 
lyricism or natural magic or roundness of form, 
he more than makes up for this in greater rich- 
ness and variety and in what must be called, 
for lack of a better word, the quality of human- 
ness. It is daily, personal experience that 
interests Mr. Monro personal experience 
viewed from the individual centre, observed 
almost religiously as it flows from moment to 
moment in the stream of consciousness. This is 
in the strain which is perhaps the richest in 
potentialities among modern tendencies in 
poetry. To a considerable extent it implies the 
transference of the method of the psychological 
novel or play to poetry: in the end it is nothing 
less than a poetic study of consciousness itself. 
In this respect Mr. Monro's method is right 
rather than successful. His speech, if robust, 
is crabbed, muttering, and laborious. His pre- 
occupation with the profound trivialities which 
make up our lives, though often fresh and 
delightful, as in parts of the two series called 
"Week End" and "Strange Meetings," some- 
times merely results in amiable catalogues, 
humorously tinged with panpsychism. Along, 
too, with a good deal of real imaginative rich- 
ness Mr. Monro displays an unfortunate ten- 
dency to push quaintness and whim to the verge 
of preciosity. Should a train, for instance, be 
said ever to "tittle tattle a tame tattoon"? 
This is an example of a good idea not quite 
successfully brought to birth. It should be 
added that Mr. Monro does not do this often, 
and that, in general, his work has an intellectual 
saltiness of originality which makes it satisfactory 
and often delightful reading. And as was said 
above, it gains in suggestiveness because it is in 
a strain, as yet infrequent in modern poetry, 
but probably destined to great importance: the 
strain of psychological realism ; although Mr. 
Monro cannot be said to have taken that method 
either far or subtly. 

Mr. de la Mare, presumably, needs no intro-

duction. His "Peacock Pic" consists of lyrics 
ostensibly for children; in reality it contains 
some of the most delightful work he has done. It 
is doubtful whether any other living American or 
English poet can weave simple melody as deftly 
as Mr. de la Mare, melody both as regards words 
and ideas. If after a century has passed one 
may recall Leigh Hunt's categories of imagina- 
tion and fancy as the two springs of the poetic, 
it would be no violence to say that Mr. de la 
Mare's power over us is rather in fancy than in 
imagination. It is delicate, elusive, impalpable; 
over the simplest lyrics hangs an overtone of 
magic. And now and again, as in the "Song 
of the Mad Prince," this magic reaches a grave 
intensity which strikes well to the marrow of 
things. Mr. de la Mare is not an innovator, 
and his scope is not great; but within his scope 
he has no superior. 

If after a reading of these three rather typ- 
ical English poets we recall as contrast the dom- 
inant notes in contemporary American poetry, 
certain differences stand out conspicuously. De- 
spite the fact that Mr. Monro manifests a slight 
orientation in a new direction, we may say that 
these poets, like most contemporary English 
poets, hold more or less surely to the main poetic 
tradition, in particular as concerns the theory 
that lyric poetry is a decorative rather than an 
interpretative art, and that its affair should be, 
primarily, the search for and modulation of 
beauty, with or without regard to its nearness 
to human experience. The result is that from 
a purely literary viewpoint English poetry of 
the present day is much more perfectly finished, 
much maturer, than American poetry. On the 
other hand, it loses proportionately by this very 
fact. By comparison with contemporary Amer- 
ican poetry, which is more empirical, drawing 
more boldly on the material of a wider con- 
sciousness, without so sharp a literary distinc- 
tion between the poetic and the non-poetic, and 
more richly experimental as concerns questions 
of form, English poetry appears at once thin- 
ner and more "literary." It does not seem to 
relate so closely to the complete life of the indi- 
vidual. It becomes obvious, in view of this con- 
trast, to hope for some sort of fusion of the 
two methods. Will the poet arise who will have 
no occasion for envying either "this man's art" 
or "that man's scope"? It appears to be only 
a question of time. CONRAD AIKEN.

HISTORY OF GERMANY IN THE NINETEENTH CRN- 
TURY. By Hcinrich von Treitschke. Translated 
by Eden and Cedar Paul. Vol. II. (Robert M. 
McBride & Co.; $3.25.) 

The German youth entering the University 
of Berlin is met at the door by a huge statue of 
Treitschke, standing in a flamingly heroic atti- 
tude. On his shoulder is perched the imperial 
German eagle, intently gazing into his face. 

There is every reason why the German eagle 
should listen to what Treitschke has to say, for 
what he says is balm to its soul and music to its 
ears. The German Michael would have been 
better off if he had not listened to Treitschke, 
but the German eagle, patriotic, imperialistic, 
and rapacious, did well to press him to its bosom. 

Take, for example, this second volume of 
Treitschke's magnum opus his "History of 
Germany in the Nineteenth Century." It deals 
with a dull period and to a liberty-loving man 
a disconcerting period. From 1815 to 1819, 
Germany was losing the high-strung heroism of 
the Wars of Liberation and was busy planting 
potatoes, for the simple reason that for the time 
being potatoes were more needed than heroism. 
Now, other peoples have planted potatoes with- 
out saying anything about it. Not so the Ger- 
mans. When a German plants his potatoes or 
drinks his beer and smokes his pipe, he is engaged 
in a good old German custom. He is performing 
a task, noble, patriotic, and almost religious. At 
least, one would think so after reading Treitschke. 
It is true that he is hard put to it to reconcile 
this unheroic period with his heroic bluster. In 
fact he does not hesitate to show his contempt 
for it on one page while growing sentimental 
over it on the next. For so he oscillates between 
heroic brutality and tribal sentimentality. 

Yet Treitschke has a keen eye and a sharp 
tongue. He sees the Germany of 1815-19 pass- 
ing through a silent crisis. He sees that the 
particularism which made possible the division 
of Germany during the Napoleonic ascent is again 
coming to the top and with it the antiquated 
feudal organization which Napoleon had greatly 
damaged but not totally destroyed. His problem 
is how to condemn this particularism, for 
Treitschke is an arch-imperialist, to get rid of 
it and still keep the old feudalism. Treitschke's 
Weltanschauung, which comes out so glaringly 
in his controversy with Schmoller, is intimately 
associated with the maintenance of a monarchical 
and aristocratic order. Life to him means the

keeping up of the heroic paraphernalia of a mil- 
itary social system, on which is built a rigid 
division of classes, devoted to the carrying out 
of the classical ideal of life with a German 
accent. For his ideal of national heroism he 
needed a united Germany, which involved the 
break-up of the old princely organization. For 
his ideal of a "cultural" nation he needed the old 
feudal organization. How solve this problem? 
Treitschke does not solve it, but he makes a 
spectacular attempt. 

He begins by denouncing the eighteenth cen- 
tury and Rousseau. To do so was and is quite 
the fashion in Germany. The spirit of the 
eighteenth century was one of cosmopolitan lib- 
eralism and international good will a spirit 
utterly at variance with the efforts at national 
self-sufficiency predominant in the nineteenth. 
The eighteenth century also believed that un- 
aided human reason could frame schemes of hu- 
man welfare without recourse to the accidental 
historical experience of any people. This un- 
historical procedure had the effect of alienating 
the feelings of the student or reformer from 
the particular past of a particular people. The 
moment history was turned out of doors, Ger- 
many said farewell to the particular feudal ex- 
perience which was so dear to the heart of 
Treitschke and his reactionary Germanophiles. 
This, of course, they could not tolerate. Since 
the international spirit of the eighteenth cen- 
tury carried with it also ideas of constitutional 
reforms, such reforms are, naturally, viewed as 
a recurrence of the "Jacobinism" of the earlier 
period, and therefore sternly opposed. Treitsch- 
ke's opposition goes on the path of a particular 
God-given characteristic of the German people 
which does not comport well with the notion 
of constitutional reforms. The idea that the 
opinions and convictions of the common people 
should be consulted in matters of government, 
and that on these matters they should be con- 
sidered the court of last resort, seems to him 
to be a proposition so utterly ridiculous, so ex- 
travagantly absurd, that he laughs himself sick 
over it. 

This attitude comes out very clearly in his 
treatment of Rotteck. Rotteck was a historian 
and political scientist of Wurttemberg who rep- 
resented the cosmopolitan-democratic ideas of 
the eighteenth century. He had a good deal to 
do with directing his country early on the path 
of constitutionalism. He was a man of great 
humanitarian enthusiasm and highly respected in 
his own community. Treitschke treats him with 



amused contempt. He speaks of him as a paro- 
chial Philistine and a scientific hewer of wood 
and drawer of water, and accuses him of "spurn- 
ing the historical world" because of his espousal 
of liberal ideas. The possibility is not precluded 
of Rotteck's having been all these things in spite 
of his liberal ideas, but it is clear that in Treitsch- 
ke's estimation he is a Philistine and a hewer of 
wood because of his liberal ideas. Treitschke 
seeks the heroic everywhere and at all times, and 
Rotteck was unheroic enough to take account of 
the immediate humanity of the people about 
whose destinies he was writing and philosophiz- 
ing. This seems to our historian a most glaring 
perversion. A pretty pass shall we have come to 
if we allow mere human beings to interfere with 
the God-appointed destinies of the state! Of 
course what is sauce for the goose is not sauce 
for the gander. What Treitschke says of Sa- 
vigny, the darling of the historically minded, can- 
not be applied to Rotteck. When Savigny, with 
consistent Historismus, says that law must always 
remain the product of the unconscious social 
forces and national intelligence, Treitschke firm- 
ly but respectfully (of course!) begs to differ 
with him, asserting that "law is actually deter- 
mined not by national intelligence but by the 
national will," which national will, if it means 
anything, means precisely what Rotteck was try- 
ing to express when he insisted that an enlight- 
ened public opinion must have its share in 
framing its own laws and its own social and 
political organization. But then, what Treitschke 
probably means by national will is the will of 
His Majesty the King, expressed by His Excel- 
lency the Chancellor to His Honor the Bureau- 
crat. 

On the whole, one rises from a reading of this 
volume of Treitschke's "History" with a feeling 
of having listened to a very able apologist of a 
reactionary, one-sided, and autocratic order, 
parading under the guise of progress and hero- 
ism. One cannot escape, however, a feeling also 
of disgust at the diseased passion to prove Ger- 
many great in all things and at all cost. When 
Treitschke speaks of the work of German scien- 
tists, which at that period was a sad affair at 
best, one gets the impression that to him scien- 
tific work is a matter of patriotism ; the scientist 
is something in the nature of a patriotic fighting- 
cock whose business it is to overtake and beat 
the scientists of other nations. He sets it down 
to the particular credit of Germany that Hum- 
boldt was well received in scientific circles in 
Paris, and forgets that Humboldt had to go to 



154

Paris because he could not get a hearing in his 
own land and because the field of scientific en- 
deavor in Germany was an intellectual Sahara. 
English readers will not fail to be amused when 
he tells them that "Walter Scott, the most fruit- 
ful and best-loved poet of the age, went to school 
to Buerger and Goethe"! 

Let the German eagle, by all means, look 
gratefully into Treitschke's face, for he has done 
a good job, better than the historians of other 
nations have ever done. As long as history is 
looked upon as the proper field for the exhibition 
of patriotic animosity and sentimental turbulence, 
we shall have no right to object to Treitschke. 
He is only doing what they are all doing, doing 
it a little more crudely, more bluntly, more re- 
voltingly (to the outsider), and consequently 
more effectively. The difference between them 
is only a difference of degree and not of kind.

Gorky 

IN THE WORLD. By Maxim Gorky. (Century 

Co.; $2.) 

An attentive reader of Gorky might have seen 
that he was prepared to write this amazing 
book. If all good fiction is a kind of auto- 
biography, Gorky's fiction is often avowedly just 
that. He likes to enter directly into his tales, 
showing us this or that episode precisely as if 
it had gone on under his own eyes as, no doubt, 
more than one actually had. And in those tales 
and sketches, so casually and vividly handled as 
to resemble bits of the actual seized almost at 
random, he has known how to find the evoca- 
tive word, to summon a mood or stamp an 
impression on the mind, and pass rapidly on to 
something else. Swiftness and brevity these 
are great virtues in a man who is going to tell 
us the story of his life. They fill us with assur- 
ance at the outset. We can trust him not to 
bore us by piling up detail or losing his way 
among the labyrinthine windings of formal auto- 
biography, in which there is neither perspective 
nor any merciful sense of values. Nor does 
Gorky disappoint us. Everywhere in this, the 
second, volume of his Life, one finds the shining 
virtues of brevity, concreteness, vigor always 
unfailing vigor. That there is also a moving 
sincerity goes without saying, since Gorky is in 
the great Russian tradition. 

The first volume carried us up to Gorky's 
twelfth or thirteenth year, to the time when he 



left the house of his grandfather. The second 
volume, thick as it is with impressions and rich 
in the material of character, gives us two or three 
years only of his life in the world ; when up- 
take leave of him, he is just setting out for 
Kazan, in the futile hope (as we shall hear 
later) of getting an education for nothing. Thus 
it is still almost a child's world in which we 
are moving a world seen with that fascinating 
mixture of sophistication and simplicity which 
his genius made possible. Gorky was restless and 
passed from place to place, always wretched, 
trying to find a world which he could reconcile 
with his dreams. As door-boy in a shoe shop, 
drudge in the house of an architect, dish-washer 
on a Volga steamer, apprentice in an icon- 
painter's establishment, he was beaten and 
bedeviled and dragged through the foulest back- 
wash of life. It was a brutal experience that 
might well have turned him into a brute an 
experience, so far as one can see, that offered 
little enough to the future writer except the 
maturity that suffering brings. But in such 
cases talent is almost everything, and certainly 
no talent could have set itself more sharply 
and decisively to work. Gorky was a born 
novelist, for whom the special enigma of charac- 
ter never lost its torturing fascination; he had 
already begun to observe, not coldly and criti- 
cally but with a brooding and terrible intensity. 
He observed that he might learn, but with no 
detached and purely intellectual passion. On 
the contrary, he was quiveringly responsive to 
suffering; the sight of cruelty, he tells us, roused 
in him a physical repulsion that swiftly trans- 
formed itself into a cold fury. He had a "fas- 
tidious dislike of unhappiness, illness, and 
grievances." And these things, with many more 
abominations, were always under his eyes. The 
dulness of life, which oppressed his companions, 
weighed too upon him and desolated his heart. 
He was prepared to understand the profound 
melancholy of a people tormented by the riddle 
of existence a melancholy growing less out of 
the weight of external conditions than out of a 
deep intuition of the futility of man's fate, the 
sense of life flowing past, eluding the clutch, 
dropping at last into the void. Why struggle 
against the inevitable? 

"Don't struggle, don't hope for anything, for 
the grave and the church yard let no man pass," 
says the mason, Petr; and Uncle Yaakov sums 
up his life in a few contemptuous phrases: 
"Take myself, for instance; what has my life 
been? I look back on it with shame, everything

by snatches, stealthily ; my sorrows were my own 
but my joys were stolen. Either my father 
shouted, 'Don't you dare!' or my wife screamed, 
'You cannot!' I was afraid to throw down a 
ruble. And so all my life has passed away, and 
here I am acting the lackey to my own son. 
. . But, even without that, why was I 
born? What pleasure have I had in my life?" 
Whatever one may think of this characteristic 
Russian pessimism, it is solidly based: it com- 
plains, not of the transitory and the remediable, 
but of the unsatisfactoriness of first and last 
things. It expresses a deep, philosophic discontent. 

Is this sombre mood Gorky's own ? It is hard 
to say. I confess I had thought so from a read- 
ing of the tales and novels in which he seems 
obsessed with the hideousness of life. But here 
he tells us that he was often troubled by the 
thought that "sorrow appealed more than joy 
to the hearts of these people." He himself 
struggled against the "dreamy Russian sadness" 
and often desired to cast a spell over the whole 
earth which would cause everyone "to be swept 
by a joyful whirlwind, a festival dance of 
people. . ." In fact, there were two men in 
him. One was aware of only too many abomina- 
tions and obscenities and had come to view life 
and people "distrustfully and contemptuously, 
with a feeble pity." He wished only to escape 
from the world of men. But the other, nourished 
on books and dreams, "loved and pitied actively." 
This is the Gorky who can look to the future 
hopefully and call himself a lover of humanity. 
"All that is good and human in our hearts and 
brains needs renewing." 

That he loved and pitied actively there can be 
no doubt. This book is full of the beautiful 
evidence of it. The intuition of genius carried 
him deep into the heart of the strange Russian 
nature, and one cannot read his report of it 
without becoming oneself more human. The 
heroic figure of his grandmother, which domi- 
nated the first volume, appears here only occa- 
sionally but the impression is even deepened. 
One feels that this strong and good woman was 
the great formative influence in Gorky's life and 
that the sweetness and soundness of her nature 
explain in great measure the miracle by which 
the lonely boy escaped shipwreck. But there 
are other figures hardly less striking. The fat 
cook of the Volga steamer, who encouraged 
Gorky's passion for reading and gave him books ; 
Yaakov, the stoker, "with his ape-like hands," 
before whose eyes life burned "like the flame of 
the stove beneath the boilers" ; Petr Vassilich, the 



pious and scoundrelly "valuer" of icons; "Queen 
Margot"; Gorky's step-father, a decayed aristo- 
crat dying of consumption all these walk into 
and out of the pages, preserving their secrets, 
filling us as they filled the boy with a troubled 
sense of what is deepest and most ambiguous in 
human character. And for Gorky, as for us, the 
mystery remains. That it tortures him some- 
times, who can doubt? For when Yaakov 
Shumov went away, rolling from side to side 
like a bear, Gorky was aware in his heart of an 
uneasy and perplexed feeling. 

"And what sort of man was he Yaakov 

Shumov?"

The American Constitution 

THE AMERICAN PLAN OF GOVERNMENT. By 
Charles W. Bacon and Franklyn S. Morse. With 
an Introduction by George Gordon Battle. (G. 
P. Putnam's Sons; $2.50.) 

"There come crises to all nations times when 
actions taken or policies adopted will vitally 
affect the lives of future generations. At such 
times men are forced to think to go back to 
fundamentals to re-examine the foundations of 
their institutions. For the United States this 
second decade of the twentieth century is a period 
of crisis." These words from "The American 
Plan of Government," by C. W. Bacon and F. 
S. Morse, two lawyer-graduates of Harvard, 
make an even stronger appeal than when written 
several months ago. At this time, thinking 
Americans are turning to the Constitution to find 
out whether or not a plan of government adopted 
127 years ago to give the people of thirteen little 
republics a central government is strong enough 
to protect them from internal dissension and 
foreign aggression, whether or not that Consti- 
tution is still sufficient for the management of 
the business of a nation which uses commercial 
and industrial machinery not dreamed of in the 
constitution-making era. To say, therefore, that 
this is a timely book is trite; perhaps it is better 
to express our appreciation for having just now 
such "an interpretation of the Constitution of 
the United States by accepted authorities," the 
authority followed being, for the most part, none 
other than the Supreme Court of the United 
States. When decisions of this court on con- 
stitutional questions are unavailable, recourse is 
had to decisions by state courts and to constitu- 
tional writers of repute, including Alexander 
Hamilton, James Madison, and Joseph Story.

THE DIAL 



[August 30 



The purpose of the book is to show the real 
meaning of the Constitution and its actual work- 
ing as a plan of government. To do this, the 
authors take up the Constitution clause by clause 
at times almost word by word interpreting 
the one and defining the other in the exact words 
of judicial decisions. Herein lies its library value, 
for it puts within reach of the general reader a 
great fund of exact constitutional knowledge 
hitherto accessible only to the lawyer or to the 
trained investigator. All references are to or- 
iginal sources, long, involved decisions and 
irrelevant details being omitted, so that defini- 
tions are clean-cut and unmistakable. On each 
constitutional question, the authors select, as a 
rule, a single leading case and present only so 
much of the decision in that case as contains the 
desired definition. Not all provisions of the 
Constitution, however, can be treated adequately 
in this summary manner, for the meaning of 
some has been extended gradually by judicial 
interpretation in successive decisions. The inter- 
state commerce clause, for example, has grown 
in meaning so that the power of Congress has 
come to include control of the navigable waters 
of the United States, the regulation of railroad 
rates and articles of commerce, and the forbid- 
ding of combinations and contracts in restraint of 
trade. On the meaning of other provisions of the 
Constitution, the Supreme Court has sometimes 
disagreed even to the extent of reversing itself, 
as in the Legal Tender and the Income Tax cases. 
In the discussion of such constitutional provi- 
sions, the authors trace the history of their in- 
terpretation by presenting a series of decisions. 

"The American Plan of Government," in 
spite of its rigid accuracy and exactness of defini- 
tion, is an easy and interesting book to read, and 
this was made possible by a novel plan of pre- 
sentation. This consists of prefacing each cita- 
tion with a statement of the facts in the case that 
shows how the word or phrase in question came 
to be carried to court for interpretation. These 
statements of fact, many of them of historic note, 
others of human interest, show how constitutional 
principles are applied as rules of action to the 
affairs of everyday life. Without such state- 
ments, knowledge of the Constitution would re- 
main abstract and theoretical; with them, it 
becomes concrete and practical. The book shows 
the general reader how our national government 
rests on a great, living body of constitutional 
law, broader and more vital than the original 
Constitution from which it sprang, but which, 
designed for the United States of the Revolu- 



tionary era, has endured with surprisingly few 
changes for over a century and a quarter. We 
see the present Constitution of the United Stato 
as a system of constitutional law that, largely 
through judicial decisions, has grown up about 
it. The growth of the United States in extent 
and power and the increasing complexity of its 
national life have demanded a progressive modifi- 
cation of its plan of government. New con- 
ditions have demanded new laws or new 
applications of existing laws, with the result that 
ajjain and again the courts have been called upon 
to measure each new law or new application, and 
the standard of measurement has been al\va\s 
the Constitution. The ever-growing body of 
decisions in such cases forms the system of fed- 
eral constitutional law on the authority of which 
rests our national government of to-day. 

Librarians to whom come requests for such 
information as this, will appreciate the value of 
"The American Plan of Government," a book 
which should be found in every library, large 
or small, for it has to do with the fundamentals 
of American government, a subject of absorbing 
interest in these stirring times. Strange to say, 
there is no similar work in existence.

Progress in Education 

EDUCATION AND LIVING. By Randolph Bourne. 
(The Century Co.; $1.25.) 

The majority of Americans are not, as so 
many people aver, apathetic in regard to the 
war: they are apathetic only in regard to the 
violation at home of those principles for which 
they are setting out, so very gallantly, to fight 
abroad. The sentencing to imprisonment of a 
young man whose crime was the circulating of 
excerpts from the Declaration of Independence, 
the lynching of a worker because he was in op- 
position to the emotional tendencies of to-day, 
the advocacy by a senator (Mr. Harding) of a 
dictatorship for this country, such things have 
called forth little reproach and less criticism. 
Why? Because the schools of the past have 
taught their students, as most of the schools of 
the present are teaching them, not how to think, 
but how to accept thoughts already hardened 
into formulas; not how to evaluate events and 
actions, but how, if the former be unpleasant, 
to ignore them, and how, if the latter be per- 
formed by those in temporary authority, blindly 
to sanction them. This will explain the apathy 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



157 



of the multitude as well as the muddle-headed- 
ness of the so-called intellectuals; and it will ex- 
plain, furthermore, why Mr. Bourne's book, 
"Education and Living," has not only a peda- 
gogical, but also a distinctly topical, interest. 

The author's observations are of what others 
have done; and, for that very reason, coupled 
with his liberal inclinations, he is able to present 
the fairest, the most impartial, description of the 
numerous educational experiments now making 
in America. His marshalling of them is im- 
pressive; his review of them, concise, lucid, 
constructive. One may therefore assert that 
"Education and Living" is the best handbook for 
teachers that has thus far appeared. Few of us 
have had the opportunity to travel the country 
over in search of such material as he gives us; 
and hitherto we have had to rely upon scattered 
or inadequate information. 

The only serious fault to be found with this 
book is that it is either too comprehensively 
titled or too exclusive in confining itself almost 
entirely to the grammar and the high schools. 
Though the scholastic "groundwork" is certainly 
superior to the succeeding work, it is, equally 
certainly, not so "excellent and thorough" as 
Mr. Bourne believes it to be. Furthermore, the 
author is too brief and cursory in his treatment 
of the colleges; and his remarks about the un- 
dergraduate are superficial. Anyone who has 
had intimate contact with the freshmen at one 
of our universities will have discovered some- 
thing very different from what Mr. Bourne 
calls the "baffling resistance of the undergradu- 
ate mind." He will have discovered, on the 
contrary, an eager receptivity, a surprising and 
delightful intellectual buoyancy. It is only after 
the undergraduate has been thoroughly stu- 
pefied by his professors that he becomes impervi- 
ous to ideas, points of view, interpretations. 

Mr. Bourne is, of course, right in putting the 
emphasis on the worse-than-wasted years that 
succeed the primary school, and he is right also 
in his condemnation of the methods that make 
recitations merely "a skilful guessing on the part 
of the child of what the teacher wants him to 
say." This is due to the fact that the method 
natural to the child is absolutely reversed: in- 
stead of being allowed to use his teacher as a 
medium of knowledge, a source from which he 
may, in his curiosity, draw, he is set difficult 
and usually uninteresting tasks which test only 
his ability to memorize and the docility of his 
character. And this strange reversal is driven 
so far that in such a subject as history, for in- 



stance, he is forced to begin, not with facts which 
might entice his attention, but with events so 
distant in time that he cannot bring them into 
any sort of relationship with himself. . . Any 
criticism of this procedure is met with the old 
statement that it is necessary for discipline, 
though it is easily demonstrable that the great- 
est concentration, the most protracted effort, and 
therefore the most and best discipline, are ob- 
tained when the child is stimulated to his studies 
by his own inquisitiveness and sympathy. 

How different from the old-fashioned methods 
are those described in "Education and Living"! 
The variety of the new experiments if anything 
so successful can still be considered experimen- 
tal is astonishing, though all of them are based 
on Professor Dewey's well-known dictum that 
the child can be educated only by concerning 
himself with what has meaning to him as a child, 
and not with what may have meaning to him 
later as an adult. The most significant thing 
about these experiments is that they are not 
confined to private schools where the equipment 
may be exceptional. Mr. Wirt has shown in 
his now famous Gary system that rational meth- 
ods may be applied in large public schools as 
well. 

It is unnecessary here to particularize further: 
we need only refer the reader to "Education and 
Living" with its detailed exposition and criti- 
cism, and to note the fact that Mr. Bourne's 
discussion of vocational education is probably 
the soundest on record. It may, however, be 
well to call attention to the chapter entitled 
"Education in Taste," in which the author seems 
to misconceive the very nature of taste. He 
contends, with truth enough, that the teacher 
should not impart to his students judgments of 
works of art; but he bases this contention upon 
the extraordinary notion that "we should never 
have enough Matthew Arnolds to go round." 
A host of Arnolds speaking in sentences that 
crinkle like an academic gown, favoring pupils 
with standards by which to determine the "best" 
in literature and with dogmas concerning "the 
grand style" surely, nothing could be more effi- 
cacious in producing children wholly lacking in 
taste. It might, however, obtain for us what 
Mr. Bourne seems to desire, "strange and vigor- 
ous expressions like the contemporary architecture 
and sculpture of Germany," which are in reality 
only copies, heavy vulgarizations of French 
genius. This exception noted, "Education and 
Living" is to be recommended to everyone inter- 
ested in the subject. BAYARD BOYESEN.

Mythology in the Making 

THI MYTHOLOGY or ALL RACES. Vol. VI : Indian, 
by A. Berriedale Keith; Iranian, by Albert J. 
Carnoy. (Marshall Jones Co.; $6.) 

The mythology of India possesses unique in- 
terest, not only on account of its antiquity, but 
because of the continuity of its literary records. 
For over three thousand years its steady growth, 
as well as its degenerative tendencies, may be 
traced in a series of voluminous writings, begin- 
ning about 1500 B. C. with the "Rig- Veda," 
and coming down through the "Brahmanas," the 
"Epics," the "Puranas," and the Buddhistic 
writings, to the literature of the present day. 

In that portion of the sixth volume of "The 
Mythology of All Races" devoted to Indian 
mythology, Dr. A. Berriedale Keith has with 
infinite skill cut a swathe through what seems 
an inextricable tangle of mythological detail. 
He keeps in mind constantly, the general trend 
of Indian mythology toward pantheism and its 
final flowering in the philosophy of the Absolute. 
At the same time he describes with fascinating 
lucidity the characteristics of the multiple gods, 
who grow to be more and more the symbol of 
spiritual forces. Even as early as the "Rig- 
Veda," there is a hymn, referred to by Dr. 
Keith, addressed to the Creator of Heaven and 
Earth, of the waters and all that lives, who is 
designated impersonally "the Golden Germ." It 
is repeatedly asked in the hymn, "What god shall 
we adore with our oblations?" At the end of 
the hymn he is called Prajapati, "the Lord of 
Creation." In Dr. Keith's opinion, "This 
passage is the starting point of his great history 
which culminates in the conception of the Ab- 
solute but personal Brahma." 

In dealing with the succeeding stage of the 
development of Indian mythology, the author 
bases his descriptions principally upon the Brah- 
manas, or explanatory texts, attached to the 
Vedas. 

He traces the development of the conception 
of Prajapati, showing how this god might have 
become a greater figure among the Indian pop- 
ular deities had not the philosophic spirit which 
conceived him soon gone beyond the original 
idea and translated the male form, as too per- 
sonal for the expression of the Absolute, into the 
neuter Brahman Sayambhu (Self-Existent 
Prayer), thus opening the way for the "Upa- 
nishads." 

Besides the development of the philosophic 
idea of the Absolute, the Brahmanic period sees 



the evolution of the idea of Heaven and Hell, 
and also that of Reincarnation, found first in the 
"Upanishads." It reaches its highest pinnacle 
of thought in a later Brahmana, which holds 
that the man who attains true knowledge of the 
nature of the Absolute thereby wins freedom 
from rebirth and union at death with the 
Absolute. 

In the "Epics," the imaginative bent of the 
Indian mind is especially prominent, though the 
gods show the influence of the strong philosoph- 
ical tendencies in the fact that they are no 
longer independent, eternal entities. They have 
become manifestations of one infinite power, em- 
phasized by the doctrine of the "Ages of the 
World" in which the Absolute reveals itself. 
At the expiration of three ages, each succeeding 
age being worse, everything is again absorbed 
into the Absolute for twelve million years, and 
is remanifested in the course of fresh ages. 

Vishnu and Siva are the only gods who re- 
tain a degree of real power. Upon these gods 
the Indian imagination expends itself in the 
usual riotous manner. Siva is said to appear in 
as many as 1008 forms. Vishnu has a thousand 
names, and appears in many avatars, one of the 
most important being Krishna, who is later the 
god celebrated in the "Bhagavad-Gita." Rama, 
whose exploits fill the epic "Ramayana," is an- 
other important avatar of Vishnu. 

In his chapter on Buddhism, Dr. Keith op- 
poses the view held by some scholars that Bud- 
dha was merely a man and his system originally 
a purely ethical system, though this is certainly 
indicated by its discarding of the earlier doc- 
trines of the soul and personal immortality. 
Even in the earliest texts Dr. Keith finds evi- 
dence that Buddha was regarded and regarded 
himself as a divine being. His arguments here 
do not convince. Rather does Buddha seem to 
regard himself as a type of the Beyond Man, 
neither human, in the ordinary sense of the 
word, nor divine. 

The remaining chapters are given to the Jains 
and modern Hinduism. The mythology of the 
former possesses interest because of their doc- 
trine that time is endless, and that successive 
reincarnations finally bring man to a place of 
conscious bliss, formless but consisting of life 
throughout. 

Finally, in modern Hinduism, there is an in- 
describable confusion of sacred beings and ob- 
jects, all brought into harmony by the pantheistic 
philosophy and the idea of the Absolute, which 
is now conceived of as feminine in its nature.

THE DIAL

The personifying tendency which, with a ten- 
dency to metaphorical interpretation, is the for- 
mative element in Indian mythology from the 
earliest times, is still at work, and among the 
objects of worship are found plows, yard-meas- 
ures, pickaxes, lions, tigers, and holy men. On 
the other hand, Vishnu and Siva still retain their 
importance, though in the refined philosophy of 
the cultured they are manifestations of the 
Absolute. 

Dr. Keith makes clear the development of 
philosophical ideas and yet preserves so much of 
the mythological drapery in which these ideas 
are clothed that the book possesses the double 
quality of scholarliness and fascination. By rec- 
ognizing the close connection between mythology 
and religion, he has greatly enhanced, in my 
opinion, the interest of his subject. 

Dr. Albert J. Carnoy, in his treatment of 
Iranian mythology, adopts a different plan from 
that followed by Dr. Keith. He restricts his 
definition of myth so that it excludes all that is 
properly religious, historical, or archaeological, 
and attempts to give the myths and "nothing 
more" in Iranian traditions. In accordance with 
this plan he has emphasized especially the ro- 
mantic aspects of the myths, though philosophy 
and religion are continually breaking through 
the purely imaginative elements. He gives, for 
instance, an account of the dualistic religious 
principles of the Iranians, and of their origin 
in the cosmic conflicts of sun and storm or light 
and dark, which are characteristic of Vedic 
mythology. The Iranian mind, he says, seized 
especially upon the element of conflict and elab- 
orated upon it, carrying it into the moral and 
spiritual world and also into romance and his- 
tory. Professor Carnoy illustrates these lines 
of development with many verse translations 
from the "Avesta" and the "Shah-Namah." He 
also notes interesting parallels between the myth- 
ologies of Babylon, India, and Iran. 

In conclusion he shows that his conception of 
a myth is enlarged beyond the idea that it is 
merely the beginning of science in an attempt 
to account for some phenomenon of nature. He 
declares that, besides giving an explanation, it 
tries to give the explanation picturesquely. Thus 
we see added to the popular definition of myth 
the aesthetic element. Is it not reasonable to say 
that there is also present in myth-making the 
very source of religious aspiration in the search 
for the Cause? 

The fact that in every volume of this series 
thus far examined, the writers have not suc- 



ceeded in making a clear demarkation between 
myth .and religion surely indicates that religion 
is something more than ritual, or rather that 
ritual is a crystallization of the religious element 
in myth-making. The remarkable continuity 
of the religious development of Indian myth- 
ology toward the conception of the Absolute the 
primal cause of all things and of which all phe- 
nomena are but manifestations seems to point 
to a primeval instinct in man to search for that 
cause and conceive of it in imaginative symbols 
of godhood. 

Like the other volumes, this one is rich in 
valuable illustration. A good bibliography and 
notes, chiefly bibliographical, complete these em- 
inently satisfactory treatments of two great myth- 
ologies.

The Relaxing Grip of Prussianism 

SCIENCE AND LEARNING IN FRANCE. Edited by 
John H. Wigmore. With an introduction by 
Charles W. Eliot. 

A nation that wills to impose its culture on 
other peoples must begin by believing thoroughly 
in its own superiority. Confidence is at least 
half the battle. A cult of the national life and 
habits of mind has to be established, a whole 
ritual of pious observances erected. For super- 
stition works even in the lofty realm of the in- 
tellect, and scholars, as the war has shown us, 
are not creatures of pure reason. Germany had 
such a cult. She cherished an ambition for in- 
tellectual primacy. She willed to dominate the 
world not through the crude instrument of war 
alone, but through the "peaceful penetration" of 
scholarship and the prestige of great names. In 
America, certainly, her "peaceful penetration" 
enjoyed an immense success; the influence of 
German universities and German methods was 
enormous, the respect for German scholarship 
unbounded. It was, as we see now, an undis- 
criminating respect a respect founded in good 
part on superstition, as the extraordinary defer- 
ence shown to Eucken a few years ago made 
abundantly clear. A nation that could produce 
William James and John Dewey should have had 
a better eye for philosophers. But the prestige 
of the label "Made in Germany" was as great 
when attached to scholars as to chemicals. 

Nor is it hard to account for that prestige. 
Germany, with a realistic sense which it would 
be idle to deny, understood better than her rivals 
the requirements of the new industrial age which 



160 



THE DIAL 



[August 30 



was dawning. She divined the increasingly im- 
portant role which expert knowledge would come 
to play. She saw how the development of in- 
dustry must wait on discoveries in the laboratory, 
and she put science in harness, so to speak. She 
was not hampered by the old-fashioned idealism 
that would keep science pure and undefiled by 
keeping it out of the factory. The human ma- 
terial with which her organizers had to work 
was excellent. The German is by nature patient 
and diligent ; he loves and respects learning. All 
that was needed to give Germany an undoubted 
lead in producing scientists and investigators of 
the second rank was organization on a whole- 
sale plan and the official encouragement of re- 
search. That organization she undertook and 
accomplished, with results that have been open 
to study for a long time. That her methods 
in scholarship produced excellent results, no sane 
man would dream of denying. But to claim intel- 
lectual primacy because of a marked superiority 
in the second line of achievement will hardly do. 
It sounds arrogant, when it does not sound 
absurd. And the methods themselves indis- 
pensable as they are now recognized to be are 
subject to quite serious objections if they are 
not applied with a constant critical scrutiny of 
the results. The test to apply is a rigorously 
pragmatic one. Where mere industry in the 
collection of facts facts of any order is valued 
for itself, the door is thrown open for medi- 
ocrity to enter. Those "Culture-Philistines" at 
whom Nietzsche raged are only too likely to 
give the tone and adjust the scale of values by 
which merit shall be measured. And one knows 
how the prevailing type fixes the standard of 
measurement. In our own universities, partly 
as a result of the uncritical adoption of German 
methods, the collectors of negligible facts and 
musty gossip, those busy journeymen of learning, 
have multiplied intolerably, and an appalling 
amount of sterile and frivolous activity has passed 
itself off under the name of research. If you 
doubt it and have a courage amounting to sui- 
cidal recklessness, make a wager with yourself to 
read all the doctor's theses published by a single 
great university in a year. It would be pleas- 
anter, perhaps, to face Kultur directly in the 
trenches. 

The war, which is challenging so many insti- 
tutions and shibboleths, has demolished the myth 
of German intellectual supremacy. The famous 
manifesto of the "ninety-three German profes- 
sors" was a blow to German prestige a blow 
from which it will hardly recover in our time. 



It was a miracle of ineptitude, as blunderingly 
cuiKx-ived and as stupidly drafted as any docu- 
ment lathered by the Foreign OHke. It was 
manitcbtly not the product of pure reason. A 
new orientation has become inevitable, and 
"Science and Learning in France" is one of the 
first tangible evidences of a change ut heart. 

This book, edited by Dean VVigmore, ol the 
faculty of law at Northwestern University, with 
a preface by Charles W. Eliot, emeritus presi- 
dent of Harvard University, is the work of the 
foremost scholars in the various departments of 
learning in America. It is a tactful book. It 
makes no invidious comparisons. On the con- 
trary, it expressly recognizes the high intellectual 
achievements of German scholars and thinkers. 
But it seeks to restore a lost perspective by call- 
ing attention to the distinguished work of French 
scientists in our time and reminding us of the 
distinctive qualities of the French mind. Our 
relative indifference to French culture has been 
a serious loss. We have ignored to some extent 
the great contributions to science made by the 
lucid and imaginative French intellect. The 
free experimental impulse, the absence of preju- 
dice, and the strong democratic bias give us an 
atmosphere in which progress is possible. It isn't 
pure sentiment that attaches us to the French 
people; it is really a deep if vague consciousness 
that we have set out on the same adventure and 
are committed to the same political and social 
programme. It is a "consciousness of kind." 
Nevertheless, there is not a hint of propagandist 
ardor in "Science and Learning in France." 
Such ardor would be an insult to France, which 
needs no commendation beyond the simple record 
of achievement. Everywhere in this book Western 
culture is recognized as international a growth 
to which all the peoples have made important 
contributions. What was attempted was a brief, 
judicial survey of the contributions made by 
eminent French thinkers, with special emphasis 
on the work of men now living or so recently 
dead as to belong to the modern period. Every 
field of scientific and literary investigation is 
covered by a committee of American scholars. 
The scheme of the work embraces a swift his- 
torical summary of the labors of French in- 
vestigators in each department, philosophy, 
astronomy, the social sciences, biology, and so 
on, an account of the significant contributions 
of living men, and an outline of the courses 
offered in the various universities, together with 
the special facilities for research. In short, the 
book is a compendious introduction to the intel-

lectual world of France, intended to serve as a 
guide for students who may be planning to work 
for a doctorate abroad. But it should serve 
the broader purpose of acquainting the general 
public with the brilliant achievements of con- 
temporary France. It is an impressive book in 
the mere list of famous names of the living or 
quite recently dead Henri Poihcare, Berthelot, 
Becquerel, Curie, Tarde, Durkheim, Letourneau, 
Bergson. . . In the face of such evidence of 
fertile activity as the mere names afford, one 
finds it hard to understand the vulgar notion 
that prevailed before the war that the French 
talent had exhausted itself. For this notion there 
was substituted later the equally preposterous 
one that the war had renewed French manhood. 
In truth, I think there is some need for Ameri- 
cans to read "Science and Learning in France." 
One should add that the book was planned 
and begun a year and a half ago, while the 
United States was still a neutral country; it is 
in no sense, as the editor quite superfluously 
points out, a "pro-ally document." It is simply 
the result of a conviction formed by American 
scholars that the time had come for restoring 
French science to its "place in the sun." A 
society has been formed for establishing American 
fellowships in French universities on the basis 
of competitive examination, and we seem in a 
fair way to readjust the balance. C. H. 



Edith Wharton 

SUMMER. By Edith Wharton. (D. Appleton 
& Co.; $1.50.) 

Within the memory of a not very aged reader 
of American fiction there have been a few won- 
derful moments, moments when one has realized, 
perhaps without clear, critical consciousness, that 
something important has happened. Such un- 
forgettable moments are one's first reading of 
"Roderick Hudson," and "A Modern Instance," 
and "Huckleberry Finn," and "A New England 
Nun," and "The Red Badge of Courage," and 
"Sister Carrie" (the promise of that book has 
not been fulfilled), and two books by Mrs. 
Wharton, "The Greater Inclination" and "The 
Touchstone." In those days, the end of the 
Nineties, most of the established literature of 
the world was still unexplored, and a new ar- 
rival from New York had to compete with the 
world's inexhaustible masterpieces and also with 
contemporaneous English fiction, especially the 
two gods of the undergraduate, Stevenson and 



Kipling. Mrs. Wharton dawned upon our 
ignorant but eager appreciation, a little bewil- 
dering to our immaturity because she was so 
mature and sophisticated. Henry James and 
Meredith had educated us to read her intelli- 
gently (though we had only begun to read them), 
and if our admiration was boyish it was genuine. 
I remember distinctly the emotions of surprise 
and delight at the appearance of a new writer, 
an American writer, whose first work showed 
the competence and finish of a practiced hand. 

Then followed, at intervals sufficiently long 
to indicate careful workmanship, now a novel, 
now a collection of short stories, all of unvary- 
ing excellence. But there was another sense in 
which the work was unvarying, another inter- 
pretation of the moderate rate of production. 
Though the plots were ingenious, original, not 
cast in one mold, the kind of life so acutely and 
deeply studied was a limited, even thin, upper 
layer of society. Was her material restricted? 
She saw far, she penetrated to the bottom of a 
soul, but could she see broadly? Was her 
knowledge of life at once cosmopolitan and class- 
provincial, like the outlook of Henry James? 
One of her contemporaries, Mrs. Atherton, I 
think, was reported to have expressed, apropos 
of "The House of Mirth," a somewhat envious 
fear lest Mrs. Wharton's vein should be ex- 
hausted, and to have suggested that her success 
was due, if not to her snobbery, to the snobbery 
of a public that liked to read about the high 
life. I doubt if snobbery can find an ounce of 
nourishment in the gray pathos of the story of 
Lily Bart. And as for her creator, a woman who 
is born to the social purple and to the intellectual 
purple, whose attitude toward her own class is 
tragic and ironic, who treats with a fine disdain 
just those qualities and privileges of the upper 
ten which the next four or five tens admire and 
emulate, is the shrewdest possible foe of snob- 
bery. The powerful final answer to these ques- 
tions was that amazing masterpiece, "Ethan 
Frome." And the answer is reiterated by 
"Summer." 

Before "Ethan Frome" New England fiction 
was virginal. The stork preceded the doctor, 
but nothing preceded the stork. A doubtful ex- 
ception is "The Scarlet Letter," in which the 
sorrow of illicit love is covered by a romantic 
veil. The exquisite stories of Miss Jewett and 
Miss Wilkins give delicate expression to as much 
as the shy New England characters would have 
wished to tell of themselves. These stories show 
the grace of narrow lives, the charm and humor

that can flourish amid rural poverty. By not 
making the deeper passions articulate the authors 
are precisely true to New England character. 
There are two kinds of suppression; one is the 
suppression of life by the author's ignorance or 
reticence; the other is the suppression of feeling 
by life itself. Passion beats against obdurate 
facts and falls broken and bleeding. This con- 
test must be studied objectively, for the charac- 
ters do not understand what is happening to them. 
The author understands, and sitting omniscient 
and Olympian at the right-hand side of Fate, 
contemplates their lives; at the same time he 
enters into each life with immense tenderness. 
This is the greatest achievement of that kind of 
imagination which creates fiction. The com- 
bined power of impartial contemplation and sym- 
pathy makes the genius of Thomas Hardy and it 
makes the genius of Mrs. Wharton as it is 
found in "Ethan Frome" and "Summer." For 
she cannot play with these people, as she plays 
with her people in New York society, shooting 
her own ironic shafts at them or analyzing them 
in terms of their own sophisticated talk. Her 
New England people are elemental, victims of 
circumstance (so also, of course, was Lily Bart), 
and they must be left for the irony of life to 
deal with. At the same time there is no cold 
detachment. A woman who had been reared 
on a bleak New England farm could not have 
a more intimate comprehension than has Mrs. 
Wharton of its pitiful details and lonely aspira- 
tions. And the New England woman's knowl- 
edge would not be so wise or so wide, for it 
would not include so much of the rest of life 
as to give by comparison a full realization of 
bitterness and frustration. 

For the tragedy of "Ethan Frome" and of 
"Summer" is not a shattered love affair. That 
experience is so common that everybody has 
known a case or two among his own friends. 
The tragedy is the defeat, the spiritual death, of 
natures that have not merely capacity for strong 
sexual passion but the capacity, which passion 
indicates, to grow and make something out of 
better circumstances than chance happens to 
permit. 

The saddest thing in New England, and no 
doubt in some other parts of the world, is the 
contrast between the spendor of the landscape 
and the aridity of some of the life that mocks 
its loveliness. A distinguished painter who 
knows the New England scenery but not the New 
England people told me that he admired "Ethan 
Frome," but he could not believe that such 



people lived they would all be dead by murder 
or suicide. Well, the only answer is that though 
murder and suicide are not unknown in rustic 
New England, Judge Brack was on the whole 
right: "people don't do such things." They live 
along, like Ethan Frome and his two women, 
after an abortive attempt at murder and suicide ; 
or like the girl' in "Summer," after the wreck 
of passion, they drop into a life of more or less 
comfortable resignation. For her, at the end of 
summer, there is an autumn of peace. The 
story, in its beautiful natural setting, is mellower 
and gentler than "Ethan Frome," which might 
have been called "Winter." 

In her feeling for nature Mrs. Wharton is a 
poet. My friend the painter tells me not to mix 
up the arts, and says that words cannot describe. 
Perhaps they cannot, but they do. I could prove 
it by many quotations from "Summer," but it 
is better for you to read the book and see whether 
I am wrong in regarding it as a marvel of com- 
position. The descriptions have the same con- 
tinuity with the narrative that trees have with 
the road they shelter. Mrs. Wharton is at once 
direct and subtle. She unfolds with perfect 
lucidity the complexities of human nature. Her 
sentences are so beautifully sequential that some- 
times a passage seems to straighten out, tense 
and flexible, like a taut wire; and the vibration 
is the sound of life. JOHN MACY. 



NOTES ox NEW FICTION- 



It is the astonishing combination of the mod- 
ern and the mid-Victorian that fascinates the 
reader of William J. Locke's "The Red Planet" 
(Lane; $1.50). A well-ordered globe is Mr. 
Locke's, an England rubber-tired and ball-bear- 
ing, not the dusty and irresponsible country of 
Mr. Britling. The Major, an English Gentle- 
man, is the rosy lens of the picture, and through 
his eyes we measure the charm of Betty, Sir 
Anthony's temper, Marigold's discretion, and the 
psychology of Colonel Boyce. This last is the 
book. Conrad's "Lord Jim" spent his life in 
passionate overproof of his courage in conse- 
quence of a lapse of it on his first voyage. 
Leonard Boyce spends other people's lives in the 
same effort. And we are not sure that Boyce 
is not one of the most virile men that Locke 
has ever drawn. We feel the Major's repulsion, 
we wonder at Betty's tenacious allegiance, and 
we smile at the adoration of Mrs. Boyce as \\c 
watch Leonard's mouth when he stands at the 
window with his loaded cane. But curiously, the 
reader feels his charm in spite of all dislike,

the sympathy that brought the crowd to tears 
when his blind eyes could not help him put down 
the casket. We are won by his "glorious de- 
fiance." Betty, the generous, the courageous, the 
independent, is the usual delightful Locke hero- 
ine. She rushes through quiet Wellingford in 
tumultuous glory. Phyllis fails to provide 
enough color to warrant her obstinacy. Althea, 
dead before the book opens, is the most convinc- 
ing of all, a hollyhock in an English garden. 
It is easy to forgive the sentimentality of "The 
Red Planet." In spite of the clockwork and the 
blue sky, there is the real story of a man's life. 
The tendency in modern metaphysics and 
philosophy has been toward the recognition of 
a soul in the chaos called man. Mr. George A. 
Dorsey evidently does not share this prejudice. 
In his "Young Low" (Doran; $1.50) the young 
gentleman of the title role, obsessed by sex, jour- 
neys self-consciously through twenty-eight years 
of life in different parts of the traveller's globe, 
and is left at the end of the book to go back to 
America and start all over again. The partners 
of his life vary interestingly. The girl at home, 
naturally, is not only stupid but old-fashioned; 
the strictures from which Young Low escaped 
have bound her forever. A Hungarian Jewess 
is abject and adoring. Alexandra Lanfiere, 
whose charm is difficult to discover, proves a con- 
venient vehicle for a large number of feminist 
theories, to which Young Low plays enthusiastic 
Rollo. It is unfortunate that the really excellent 
presentation of matter should be marred by a 
vast amount of modern Freudian dogma, which 
has not yet worked down to reasonable propor- 
tions. Much of it is still fermenting, and defies 
digestion. There is notable ease and grace in 
description and narrative, and with the growth of 
sympathy and understanding the author may be 
expected to produce something on a much higher 
plane. 

F. W. Bain's latest romance, "The Livery of 
Eve" (Putnam; $1.50), would make a delight- 
ful ballet. There is the proper theatrical con- 
trast between Keshawa, the handsome king, and 
Kamarupa, the hideous barber. Both are enam- 
ored of the seductive water sprite Aparajita, but 
The King may not acknowledge his love for a 
woman and the barber can never hope to gain 
any woman's toleration. Aparajita instructs the 
barber how to distenant the king from his hand- 
some body and assume that body himself, and 
afterwards she tricks him into giving up the 
king's body for an instant so that Keshawa, who 
has been led to admit his passion, may have a body 
handsome enough to woo her in. The scene in 
which the seductive water sprite, weeping over 
her dead fish, induces the barber to abandon his 
borrowed body would be delightful in such a 
ballet as the Russians stage for us. 



But however charming and picturesque it may 
be, Mr. Bain's latest story is not likely to add 
to the unique reputation which he has gained 
among discriminating readers. It is slight in- 
deed, on the lips of any but an Indian story- 
teller with a perfect rage for "making the com- 
parison," "The Livery of Eve" would be a mere 
short story. It comes out of a conversation be- 
tween the Moony-crested God and his spouse 
the Daughter of the Snow, and out of a conun- 
drum that he propounds which of the three be- 
ings, Keshawa, Kamarupa, or Aparajita is to be 
blamed as the thief? The Moony-crested God 
beats his spouse in casuistry, but she has had the 
satisfaction of hearing an agreeable and ingenious 
tale. 

Mr. Bain is one of the initiators in the litera- 
ture of to-day. When he wrote the delightful 
"Digit of the Moon," he discovered for us a 
novel sort of romance a romance that was 
neither European nor Arabian, but Indian and 
distinctive. He took Sanskrit romance with its 
mythological background and its copious com- 
parisons, its intellectual subtlety and its limited 
psychology, and infused into it an element of 
humor. By virtue of his humor he has made 
this alien literature delightfully entertaining. To 
many minds a great deal of the entertainment 
comes out of the sympathetic perception of the 
curious Indian mind. No other European writer 
gives us such a sense of being absolutely at home 
with the Pundits. Kipling, in comparison with 
the author of "A Digit of the Moon" or "A 
Draught of the Blue" or "Ashes of a God," 
seems to be a Cockney interloper. 

Two sympathetic views of the race-problem 
are presented by Mr. Paul Kester in the novel 
"His Own Country" ( Bobbs-Merrill ; $1.50). 
All the traditions of the South, and its preju- 
dices, all the arguments of the negro, and the 
evidence of the possibilities of his race have been 
carefully woven into this tragic romance. As a 
novel, the story is interesting; as a psychological 
study and as a thought-provoking introduction 
to more serious consideration of the future of the 
colored race in America, it deserves attention. 
To offset the prolixity and occasional stiffness 
there is a sincere and wholesome study of con- 
ditions and atmosphere that cannot fail to im- 
press the reader. 

There is no especial enlightenment concerning 
the "misunderstood Americans" of the southern 
mountains, to be derived from "The Master of 
the Hills," by Sarah Johnston Cocke (Dutton; 
$1.50). The book proves, if it proves anything 
at all, that an author may be fairly truthful in 
regard to history, geography, and dialect, and 
yet completely miss the essential characteristics 
of a people the things that give them life, and 
their story the savor of reality.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS 



RAYMOND, OR LIFE AND DEATH. By Sir 

Oliver Lodge. Doran; $3. 

To review this volume is a painful task how- 
ever considered. One hesitates to wound the 
sensibilities of the writer, not as a man of science, 
but as a father who has lost in the chance of 
battle a peculiarly promising and beloved son. 
The book begins with a brief record of the life 
and services of young Raymond Lodge and in- 
cludes estimates of his character by comrades and 
some of his letters from the trenches. They tell 
what is a sadly familiar story: much bravery, 
admirable self-command, an engaging personality, 
a strong sense of duty, and the fatal rendez- 
vous with death. The bulk of the volume is an 
account of seances with various spiritualistic me- 
diums, in which the dead son speaks and, to the 
satisfaction of Sir Oliver and other members 
of his family, gives evidence of his acquaintance 
with the thoughts and incidents of his life on 
earth. Other distinguished Englishmen who have 
entertained similar beliefs also communicate. 
When one observes the loose conditions under 
which these seances are held, the far-fetched con- 
clusions by which the evidence is made "evi- 
dential," the overwhelming prepossession of the 
sitters in favor of the belief, the absence of pre- 
caution to guard against fraud, and then recalls 
the endless series of similar sittings that have 
demonstrably been fraudulent and the vulgar de- 
ceptions by which the mystification has proceeded, 
one cannot render any other verdict than that this 
book is pernicious in the first degree. It is a 
shocking example of how an intellect trained to 
fine reasoning in physical science utterly breaks 
down in the presence of an emotional psycho- 
logical situation. One can hardly be satisfied 
merely to pity ; one must condemn. For reason is 
too precious a matter to be sacrificed in the 
worthy cause of charity. The conscientious re- 
viewer closes the volume with a sense of regret 
that it was written. 

THE MODERNS. Essays in Literary Criti- 
cism. By John Freeman. Crowell; $1.75. 

A book professedly devoted to "the moderns" 
and opening with an essay on Mr. George Ber- 
nard Shaw might be expected to continue with 
another on Mr. Chesterton and to discuss no 
writer born earlier than the last half of the nine- 
teenth century; but Mr. Freeman's list em- 
braces Mr. Thomas Hardy, Henry James, Cov- 
entry Patmore, and Dr. Robert Bridges. The 
other names (Shaw, Wells, Maeterlinck, Con- 
rad, and Francis Thompson) just form a ma- 
jority, and hence may be considered to justify 
the book's title. The company as a whole illus- 
trate the breadth and comprehensiveness of the 



critic's sympathies and give promise of a whole- 
some catholicity in the tone of the essays. In 
his opening paragraph Mr. Freeman calls atten- 
tion to "the modesty lurking in his [Mr. Shaw's] 
defiant egotism," and then, inevitably enough, 
confronts us with such exhibitions of audacity, 
self-assertiveness, and lack of reverence (in the 
accepted sense) on Mr. Shaw's part, as to leave 
us wondering what room is left for the alleged 
modesty. One feels a little as one might in 
turning from Dixon Scott's elaborate exposition 
of "The Innocence of Bernard Shaw" to witness 
a performance of "Misalliance" or "Getting 
Married." By an odd trick of the mind Mr. 
Freeman is somehow reminded of Bunyan when 
he contemplates Mr. Shaw. All of which goes 
lo show the danger of falling into paradox when 
one ventures to handle this paradoxical genius. 
Henry James impresses the author as having "the 
most original mind of our time" which would 
be more convincing from one who had not already 
devoted more than twice as much space to the 
startling originality of the "modern" just men- 
tioned. But he writes with discernment of the 
gifted and subtle novelist. 

TURKEY, GREECE, AND THE GREAT POW- 
ERS. By G. F. Abbot. McBride; $3. 
The world-war had its beginning in the 
Balkans, and the southeast has never ceased to 
be the principal theatre of its diplomacy and a 
main scene of its armed combat. Germany's 
chief aspiration lay in the direction of the j^Egean ; 
and one of the reasons why the Entente nations 
were unwilling last December to enter upon 
peace negotiations was that the Turkish alliance 
and the Roumanian collapse had brought this 
German aspiration to approximate realization. 
A timely book, therefore, is Mr. Abbot's "Study 
in Friendship and Hate." Mr. Abbot has writ- 
ten earlier volumes on both Turkey and Greece, 
and his high qualification to discuss the kaleido- 
scopic politics centring about the Balkans and 
the eastern Mediterranean has been well proved. 
The present book consists of two series of 
chapters. The first sketches lightly, but with a 
sure hand, the relations of France, Russia, 
England, and the Germanic powers with the 
Turks; it concludes with an interesting descrip- 
tion of the perplexity of Turkey at the outbreak 
of the present war, and a statement of the con- 
siderations that finally induced the Empire to 
cast in its fortunes with the Teutonic side. The 
second series of chapters deals similarly with the 
relations of the greater powers with Greece, and 
with the difficulties of the position into which 
the Hellenic kingdom was brought by the war. 
The Turks went into the war on the Teutonic 
side, the author says, for the simple reason that 
Germany outbid the Entente nations. The best

that England and her allies did was to promise 
unimpaired independence and integrity as a re- 
ward for neutrality; and England gave offence 
at the outset by seizing two Ottoman battleships 
which were just ready to be delivered to the 
Porte by their English builders. Germany, on 
the other hand, made up the gap in the Sultan's 
fleet; plied the starving state with gold; kindled 
the Turkish imagination with visions of an Otto- 
man Empire supreme in the East, as the Ger- 
man should be supreme in the West ; and, above 
all, pushed the telling argument that if Russia 
came out of the war victorious, Turkey would 
be doomed. Mr. Abbot is strongly of the opinion 
that notwithstanding these odds, Turkey might 
have been kept neutral by good diplomacy, for 
he says that the Sultan and Grand Vizier were 
opposed to a war policy. The fault, he thinks, 
lay not with the British ambassador at Con- 
stantinople, but with the Foreign Office, and 
arose from adhering too slavishly to the policy 
of aloofness toward Turkey dictated by the 
Anglo-Russian entente. 

A final chapter, entitled "The Moral Suasion 
of Greece," is perhaps the best in the book. It 
lays bare the fundamentals of one of the most 
tangled situations for which the war has been 
responsible, and shows that the struggle was the 
last thing the Greeks "wished for or were pre- 
pared for." 

STATE SANITATION. By George Chandler 

Whipple. Harvard University Press. 

Pioneer work of a constructive type in sani- 
tary engineering, especially in the fields of sewage 
disposal, the development, protection, and care of 
water supplies, and the prevention and control 
of pollution of streams by sewage and industrial 
wastes, has marked the history of the Massachu- 
setts State Board of Health to a degree unusual 
among governmental agencies. With the rise 
of preventive medicine the activities of this board 
have been turned toward the prevention of 
epidemics, the control of contagious diseases and 
the preparation and supply of antitoxins and 
vaccines. 

The history of this board is a record of the 
vanguard of socialized medicine in the United 
States. Its successes have inspired other states to 
action and its officers have been widely recog- 
nized as leaders and advisors throughout the 
nation. For these reasons Dr. Whipple's account 
of the organization, its political and scientific 
vicissitudes and its various projects undertaken 
in sanitary and medical research form an inter- 
esting and stimulating record of American prog- 
ress in state and municipal sanitation and 
preventive medicine. The first volume of the 
three projected in this work deals primarily with 



the history of the organization and republishes 
the "Report of the Sanitary Commission of 1850," 
a pioneer document of prophetic import in the 
history of American sanitation. 

THE LOVERS. By Elizabeth Robins Pen- 

nell. Lippincott; $1. 

Six years ago, in the happy days before the 
war, Mrs. Elizabeth Robins Pennell looked 
across from her high windows in London into 
the garret of an old house across the way and 
saw two lovers clasped in each other's arms. 
It was spring when they settled in their attic, 
"with an easel, two chairs, and a mirror for 
all visible furniture," and no thought save for 
each other and the work that was to bring 
them fame and fortune. For a year she watched 
them playing and working together, preluding 
ten-minute separations with endless last words 
and kisses; then she saw them gradually losing 
their sublime unawareness of their surroundings, 
straying out of their lovers' paradise into the 
humdrum world of every-day, and finally leav- 
ing their attic and her ken. Presently she wrote 
a sketch about them, called "Les Amoureux" for 
the "Century Magazine" and the incident would 
have been closed, had it not been that Les 
Amoureux read the sketch and L' Amoureux 
came one day to bring Mrs. Pennell a book of 
his wife's verses and to explain that her lovers 
were lovers still, and had been touched and 
thrilled not, as Mrs. Pennell feared, offended 
at finding themselves portrayed by a sympa- 
thetic hand. Again the story seemed ended, but 
again there was a sequel: a saddened, widowed 
L'Amoureuse, bringing to the friend who under- 
stood and could make others understand, her 
hero-lover's letters, through which she wanted 
the world to read the tale of his bravery and 
devotion. L'Amoureux, a private, one of the 
first to volunteer, had fallen at Loos. 

From his brief, scrappy, breathless letters Mrs. 
Pennell's sympathetic touch evokes a singularly 
vivid picture of the training of that first volun- 
teer army and of its early days in the trenches 
somewhere in Flanders days full of back-break- 
ing labor and heart-breaking hardships and mis- 
eries and dangers. Because he was a true artist, 
L'Amoureux had the seeing eye and the think- 
ing mind behind it; writing as a private, he rec- 
ords, unconsciously, the experiences of millions 
of newly made soldiers who leave the life that 
they know to come and go as they are bidden, 
for reasons that they know . not, in support of 
policies that they do not understand. But for 
his letters, L'Amoureux would have passed, like 
most of his comrades, silently into the Great 
Silence. Because it is a true romance, "The 
Lovers" is a book to bring the huge, wasteful 
tragedy of war strongly home to its readers.

THE LIVING PRESENT. By Gertrude Ath- 

erton. Stokes; $1.50. 

WOMEN IN WAR. By Francis Gribble. 

Dutton; $2.75. 

Apropos of a conversation with Madame 
Camille Lyon in which that distinguished mem- 
ber of the French bourgeoisie accused her of be- 
ing the most impatient of women, because, in 
going the rounds of ateliers and hospitals, she 
saw places and left them in such haste, Mrs. 
Atherton says of herself: "The truth of the 
matter was that I had long since cultivated the 
habit of registering definite impressions in a 
flash." This quality of mind, combined with a 
dramatic sense fostered through the practice of 
writing fiction, has enabled her to gather exten- 
sive material during her three months' stay in 
France (in the Spring of 1916), and to present a 
vivid picture of Frenchwomen in war times. 

Mrs. Atherton was a sympathetic investiga- 
tor of the work which Frenchwomen have done 
because she is a great admirer of the French na- 
tion, which she considers, obviously, as pre- 
eminent among the warring nations of Europe. 
That the attributes of the French, which she de- 
scribes at length, belong to the women as well 
as to the men, is proved by the conspicuous ex- 
amples of resourcefulness, self-abnegation, un- 
tiring energy, and spiritual exaltation which she 
cites among all classes the aristocracy, the bour- 
geoisie, and the working people alike. It is in- 
teresting to become acquainted individually with 
the women of France who are associated with 
the founding and carrying on of the great relief- 
works of which we were poignantly, but imper- 
sonally, aware. The ouvroirs, the confines, the 
"comfort package," the caring for the eclopes, and 
the reformes, Lt bon gite, the systematic training 
of women to do men's work intelligently, the 
effort to rescue children of the frontier all these 
and other splendid works are described. Mrs. 
Atherton is at her best when she confines herself 
to the concrete, and her portraits of French 
women have charm and piquancy. 

That great social and economic changes will 
be the result of these women's far-reaching and 
hitherto unimagined activities, is Mrs. Atherton's 
opinion, and this question she discusses in the last 
part of her book under the general subject of 
"Feminism in Peace and War." At this point, 
"The Living Present" changes, in a measure, its 
character, for its author becomes discursive and 
resorts to generalities which are not always con- 
vincing. Mrs. Atherton's book, we believe, 
would have been more delightful, had she con- 
fined herself to portraiture and narrative, instead 
of undertaking, rather superficially, an abstract 
discussion of values. 

Recently we have had our attention sharply 
drawn to the fact that women may fight as 



fervently as they administer to the needs of the 
wounded. Any preconceived notion that the 
Russian "Legion of Death" is an innovation, is 
quickly dispelled when one turns to Mr. Francis 
Cribble's "Women in War" and reads of the 
valiant achievements of "warrior queens" of the 
past. This is a historical account of the part 
which women of various nations have actually 
played in great battles, brought up to date by 
the mention of the exploits of certain women in 
the present war. 

Mr. Gribble writes of Jeanne d'Arc in detail, 
and with an open mind attempts to give her a 
proper place in history, conceding neither to 
M. Anatole France that she was merely the tool 
of the clergy, nor to Andrew Lang that she 
was the great military leader he thought her. 
His searching desire for fairness toward Jeanne 
d'Arc gives one confidence in the author's esti- 
mate of other women warriors with whose repu- 
tation the reviewer is less familiar. He specu- 
lates less than does Mrs. Atherton on woman's 
"status." His viewpoint appears to be, in the 
main, historical, although he has some interest- 
ing theories to account for the significantly feu- 
German women who have distinguished them- 
selves along military lines. 

CONFESSIONS OF A WAR CORRESPONDENT. 
By William G. Shepherd. Harper; $1. 

Kot war events, but the adroit methods by 
which such events, despite censorship and red 
tape, may be related with promptness and pi- 
quancy and some approach to truth, for the 
benefit of newspaper readers, form the subject 
of Mr. Shepherd's crisp narrative. He is said 
to have been the first American reporter per- 
mitted at the British western front, and to have 
been the only newspaper man to witness the first 
battle of Ypres. He also reported the fall of 
Antwerp, and has had a varied experience at the 
German, Austrian, and Italian fronts. His story 
brings out well the three stages through which 
war correspondence has passed in the course of 
the present conflict, and he calls them the "free- 
lance days," the "dark ages," and the "stage of 
the new twentieth-century war correspondent." 
Lurid sensationalism characterized the first 
period, an unnecessary and vexatious meagrenr^ 
of war news marked the second, and something 
like a happy medium between the riot of an 
irresponsible writer's imagination and the severe 
brevity of official reports seems to have been at- 
tained in the new era now entered up-m. The 
book is an entertaining and apparently truthful 
account of a war reporter's trials and triumphs 
and its author is an accredited correspondent nt 
the United Press. He is an adept at adding the 
requisite touch of realism, but when he equips

SECOND WIND. By Freeman Tilden. 

Huebsch; $1. 

Present conditions are causing something of a 
movement back to the land, from which, we are 
becoming acutely aware, we draw our sustenance. 
Therefore Mr. Freeman's "Second Wind," which 
professes in a sub-title to tell "the plain truth 
about going back to the land," is a good book 
to read at this time, since it is written by one 
who evidently knows something about farming 
and is under no illusions as to the amount of 
hard work and, above all, intelligent work that 
successful farming demands. But whether the 
writer's "Alexander Hadlock," who got his 
second wind at sixty-two and exchanged the pro- 
fessor's chair for the farmer's hoe is a real per- 
son or purely imaginary, it would be hard to 
say. Perhaps he is a little of both. Perhaps the 
book is only another David Grayson adventure 
in contentment. It has some of the pleasing qual- 
ities also of such realistic performances as "One 
Way Out," "A Living Without a Boss," and 
"The Man Who Bucked Up." It certainly 
makes the sexagenarian Hadlock, with his iron 
determination not to be beaten and his courage- 
ous matching of his wits and pluck and energy 
against adversity, a very real and interesting 
character. A stony Vermont farm "aban- 
doned," of course is the scene of his fight for 
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; and of 
course the fight ends in victory for Hadlock, 
else the story would not have been told. Inci- 
dentally the narrative conveys considerable in- 
formation about soils, fertilizers, dairy-farming, 
silos, ensilage, potato-bugs, and human nature, 
both rural and urban. There is not enough de- 
tail about the hero himself and the catastrophe 
that left him stranded and alone at sixty-two, 
to make him quite real to the reader, but he 
serves well enough as a peg on which to hang 
a pleasing and profitable disquisition on intensive 
farming. 

AN INTRODUCTION TO SOCIAL PSYCHOL- 
OGY. By Charles A. Ellwood. Apple- 
ton; $2. 

The widespread interest in the psychological 
basis of social activities has led to a number of 
courses in social psychology, and these have nat- 
urally developed the need for textbooks. Such 
surveys frequently may be utilized to satisfy the 
interests of the general reader. For class pur- 
poses systematic exposition, with detailed heads 
of- paragraphs outlining the subject, offered in 
acceptable prose, represents the requirement. 



Professor Ellwood has followed the traditional 
manner, and has produced a useful, well-ordered, 
and readable exposition. Thoroughly adequate 
when judged by class-room standards, the vol- 
ume can hardly be said to be notable. Yet it is 
generally unfair to criticize textbooks by the 
standards of notable contributions. Indeed, 
some teachers hold that a textbook is not a place 
for distinctive and individual contributions, but is 
in the first instance a handbook of direct service 
to the student. The texts in social psychology 
offer the educational disadvantage that their sub- 
ject-matter is not clearly defined or, when defined, 
is often a portion of another accredited domain. 
Sociology has practically sprung up in the un- 
claimed areas where the boundaries of several 
sciences failed to meet. It has also attempted 
to interpret the material of economics, of politics, 
of general social movements, and of psychology, 
from its own point of interest. Under this view 
of the function of social psychology, and the 
needs of the student, Professor Ellwood's volume 
may be recommended as a well-balanced solu- 
tion. 

THE FRAGRANT NOTE BOOK. Romance 
and Legend of the Flower Garden and the 
Bye-Way. By C. Arthur Coan, LL.B. 
Putnam's; $2.50. 

How to know the flowers, intimately and lov- 
ingly, but not at all scientifically and botanically, 
is agreeably set forth in the rambling chapters 
of Mr. Coan's delightfully original "Note Book." 
Past the "lodge of the Dumb Porter" he leads 
the reader through "no city park in which the 
weary palmer need dread signs inviting him to 
keep off the grass and attaching strange and un- 
usual penalties to the breaking of this or the 
plucking of that." It is a flower garden for 
one's most vagrant moods, fragrant with old asso- 
ciations and full of all sorts of pleasant surprises. 
Here one may listen to the tale of Narcissus 
from the beautiful youth's own lips, and revive 
one's memories of the folk-lore of the hyacinth, 
the Jack-in-the-pulpit, the Canterbury bells, 
Queen Anne's lace, monkshood, and many other 
flowers; and here is to be found a new explana- 
tion of the name borne by the foxglove : "The 
fairies play that these are gloves, because fairies 
can play anything, and to carry out the game 
they call them gloves too, just 'little folk's 
gloves,' or if they are in a hurry, 'folk's gloves.' 
You see we have it all wrong. We call 'em 
'Fox gloves' because we don't know any better. 
Fancy a fox with gloves on!" Poetry, both orig- 
inal and selected, profusely sprinkles the pages, 
and a set of "cold frames" at the end shows the 
origin of all these appropriate verses. Delicately 
tinted decorations cover the printed text, and a 
rural scene serves as frontispiece.

CASUAL. COMMENT 



FRENCH SCRUTINY OF GERMAN SCHOLARSHIP 
is getting under way. It questions both the qual- 
ity and methods of "Kultur" and even its mor- 
ality. Victor Berard, in a volume entitled "Un 
Mensonge de la Science Allemande," attacks 
Wolf's "Prolegomena to Homer," a work which, 
on its appearance in 1795, established itself as 
the chief in a new field of doubt, and has im- 
posed a rather stiff tyranny ever since. Accord- 
ing to this author, it is now clear that Wolf 
borrowed right and left, and often forgot to 
specify his borrowings. He copied Villoison, pre- 
tending that he had worked on the same subject 
before him. He copied Merian, pretending that 
he did not know of this Swiss scholar's work 
previous to the completion of his own. He 
copied the Abbe d'Aubignac, a still earlier scholar, 
who was the first to deny the existence of Homer 
and the common authorship of the Iliad and the 
Odyssey and who had put forward the hypothe- 
sis of independent tribal lays, and undertook to 
prove by false citations that the Abbe was but 
an old lunatic and that his conjectures were a 
mass of paradoxes and ineptitudes. The case of 
Wolf is put forward as representative: "No 
sooner did the human brain make a discovery 
or formulate a theory than Germany registered 
it, catalogued it, and contrived to profit by it 
and to boast of it as her own. . . France 
imagined, created, invented. . . Upon every 
Villoison that France produced, Germany at once 
let loose a Wolf who, equipped with all the 
appliances of organized science, busily fabricated 
intellectual 'merchandise,' until the world was 
aware only of the Germanic copy or counter- 
feit." Such testimony tends to put the Germans, 
along with the Japanese, among the imitative 
and assimilative peoples who "better the instruc- 
tion" derived from the really creative races and 
who, besides becoming a general menace, gain 
greater reputation for "efficiency" and other 
things than the facts warrant. 



THE WAIL THAT ALWAYS ACCOMPANIES THE 
TRANSFER OF ENGLISH BOOKS AND PICTURES 

TO AMERICA (or, more strictly, books and pic- 
tures which have been English possessions) does 
not fail in connection with the recent sale of the 
Bridgewater Library, got together by one of 
the earls of Ellesmere. A correspondent of "The 
Publishers' Circular" mourns the "lamentable 
fate of such a unique English heirloom being 
transported to America. . . To use the 
brute force of wealth at such a moment, for such 
a purpose," he declares, "is just a little bit like 
picking your grandmother's pocket at a familv 
funeral." For this are we allies! Continuing, 



this spunky writer hopes that, after all, Mr. 
Huntington may intend, after exhibiting his 
spoils in "some important centre of the U. S. 
A.," to restore them (to the British Museum) 
as a memorial of the alliance of England and 
America in the great war. The editor who prints 
the above has his own hope: that "when Mr. 
Huntington's granddaughter marries the Prince 
<>t Wales' son he may endow her with that 
gem among his other worldly goods and brin^ 
the collection back ... to its ancestral 
halls." To which flight of fancy one can only 
oppose the calm opinion that collections of this 
sort or that having served their purpose in an 
old country, may serve a wider purpose in a 
newer one. 

THE ENGLISH "DICTIONARY OF NATIONAL 
BIOGRAPHY" has been presented to the Univer- 
sity of Oxford by the family of its late proprie- 
tor. This vast undertaking was initiated in 1882 
by George M. Smith, at his sole risk and ex- 
pense. From 1885 to 1900, under the editorship 
of Sir Leslie Stephen and Sir Sidney Lee, the 
original promise of quarterly publication was 
faithfully kept; and three supplementary volumes, 
bringing the record down to the death of Queen 
Victoria, were published in 1901 : sixty-six 
volumes in all, more recently issued as twenty- 
two. Mr. Smith himself died in this latter year, 
having brought to successful conclusion, without 
state assistance or subsidy, the largest of all 
national collections of biography. In 1912, his 
wife, to whom the property had been bequeathed, 
published three more supplementary volumes. 
This vast collection is described truly as a national 
asset, and it is gratifying to learn that Oxford 
will commemorate upon the title-pages of all 
new issues by the University Press, the name of 
its initiator and first proprietor and publisher. 



MAY A PERIODICAL APPEAR AS OFTEN AS IT 

LIKES? Not in present-day England. "Notes 
and Queries," that well-known and long-service- 
able monthly, has just been balked in an effort 
to convert itself into a weekly. Of course it 
took an odd time to make the change or to try 
for it. Other British periodicals are appearing 
with maimed and scanted rites, or at lengthened 
intervals, or have discontinued altogether. "N. 
& Q." saw, however, a chance to take a different 
tack. A contributor of long standing had offered 
to purchase it, retaining the services of its time- 
honored sub-editor and those of its present pro- 
prietor as printer, and stood willing to gratify 
our intellectual curiosities fifty-two times a year 
instead of twelve. But the English Board of 
Trade had ordered that no person, without a 
lurnse from the Board, should publish any new

magazine; and for the purposes of this order 
(dating from last June) the expression "new 
magazine or other publication" has been made 
to include, with a dogged stiffness quite British, 
any periodical intended to be published more 
frequently than at the date of its order. A 
way to save paper, perhaps; but no way to slake 
a community's intellectual thirst. 

* 

WILL THE MODERN BOOK LAST? Some years 
ago there was a well-founded alarm over the 
perishable nature of much of the leather used 
in book-binding. Today there is alarm about 
the paper especially that recent invention, "art" 
paper, to whose perfectly smooth but non- 
absorbent surface so many illustrations, black or 
in colors, have been committed. There are 
thousands of works in existence from the early 
centuries of printing, often as perfect as when 
first produced, even in the hand-colored plates. 
What, it is coming to be asked, would be their 
condition now if they had been printed and hand- 
colored on paper made as our modern coated 
"art" paper is made? English paper-makers and 
publishers have been looking over the back files 
of such periodicals as have followed this method 
of illustration for thirty years the limit of 
endurance set by some authorities; and they 
seem to feel (in the absence of expert opinion 
from chemists) that there is less danger from 
clay, or chemicals, or even from resin, than from 
the old and familiar enemy, damp. One hopes 
or fears that the only danger facing the vast 
number of illustrated works sure to follow in 
the wake of the great war is one already known 
and realized. 

A PLAN TO MAKE MUSICAL CELEBRITIES 

PROMINENT IN LITERATURE is involved in the 
project of the National Society of Music, now 
reaching fruition after four years, to publish 
a comprehensive work on "The Art of Music," 
with Professor Daniel Gregory Mason, of Co- 
lumbia, as editor in chief. Some of the names 
of his contributors resound internationally, as 
those of Richard Strauss, Anna Pavlova, and 
Alfred Hertz. Others are those of well-known 
articulate forwarders of the art and themselves 
musicians, as Frank Damrosch and David Bisp- 
ham. Still other names, as that of Ernest New- 
man, give assurance that the writer as such will 
have his desired and necessary prominence. All 
this cooperative endeavor is expected to produce 
a work that will be a standard American one on 
music, will also be international in scope and in 
point of view, and will educate students and 
readers in the essentials of musical appreciation.

NOTES FOR BIBLIOPHILES 



[Inquiries or contributions to this department should be ad- 
dressed to John E. Rooinaon, the Editor, who will be 
pleased to render to reader* such services as arc possible.] 

The original oil painting of William Shakespeare 
by Sir Godfrey Kneller, after the celebrated 
Chandos portrait, said to be the only one of 
Shakespeare taken from life, is now in the pos- 
session of Gabriel Wells, of New York City. The 
painting was executed about 1710, and for more 
than a century remained in the keeping of the 
Shakespeare family. It was displayed at the Ter- 
Centenary Exhibition at Stratford-upon-Avon. 
M. H. Spielman, the literary and art critic, in a 
letter, says of it: 

I think this Chandos copy of special interest as it 
is the only one I have seen which is the exact coun- 
terpart, as to the head, of the celebrated copy that 
Kneller made and sent to Dryden. The proportions, 
expression, type of countenance and features are iden- 
tical in all respects as to the departures from the 
original Kneller made. As the Kneller has never 
been shown within the knowledge of the present 
generation, this portrait may probably create special 
interest. I base my judgement un the proof provided 
by the photograph I have taken of the Kneller picture. 

The painting is framed, the outside measure- 
ments being twenty-eight and a half by thirty-five 



inches. The portrait is strikingly brilliant, the 
tones being mellowed by age. As it is lully life- 
sized it produces the eitcct of life. 

An edition de luxe of the complete works of 
will be published by Doubleday, 
Page and Company for Gabriel Wells, and will 
be ready for distribution about the latter part of 
September. It will be in fourteen volumes, octavo, 
large type, and handmade paper. It will be lim- 
ited to 1075 sets, and will contain material never 
before published, in addition to a volume of "O. 
Henry" miscellany, entitled "Waifs and Strays." 
Tliis will have matter of great interest to the 
Henry" reader, never before gathered together. 
1-iity of the copies will be reserved for finishing 
according to the specifications of the purchaser. 
'1 he set will be fully illustrated in the photogra- 
vure process by pictures painted by Gordon Grant, 
the well-Known artist, trom types taken from real 
life. When the artist, in his prowling about the 
city, found a character that luted the person of 
"O. Henry's ' brain, he prevailed upon him by one 
means or another to pose tor the illustration in 
hand. The issuance of this de luxe set is espe- 
cially opportune at this time when "O. Henry" 
is being hailed both at home and abroad as one 
of the greatest literary artists of our time. In 
England the critics and public alike are vying with 
one another to do honor to him. Strange as it 
may seem, it has never been possible before to 
buy a complete set of "O. Henry" in fine binding, 
although millions of copies of his books have been 
sold. It is said that in England alone half a mil- 
lion copies of the one-shilling edition of his works 
have been sold. 

James F. Drake, of New York, bought, through 
his London agent, $10,000 worth of rare books of 
the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, at a 
recent sale at Sotheby's. The agent informed Mr. 
Drake that Sotheby's had obtained $50,000 for 
eighty colored prints that belonged to Mr. Barratt, 
a director of the Pears Soap Company. This sale 
lasted only one and a half hours. 

A richly illuminated manuscript, "Pontificale" or 
"Missale," on 156 leaves of vellum of Franco- 
Flemish execution of the fifteenth century, was 
knocked down at Sotheby's in London the other day 
to George D. Smith, of New York, for $4000. It 
is written in large Gothic letters, red and black, 
eighteen lines to a full page, with musical notes. 
Nearly every page has richly decorated borders in 
compartments of natural flowers and fruits and 
conventional foliage interspersed with grotesque 
human figures riding grotesque animals, mummers 
with musical instruments and performing dogs, cen- 
taurs, demons, spearmen and archers, falconers, and 
shields bearing instruments of the Passion with 
angelic and animal supports. Some of the borders 
contain small square miniatures of scenes in the 
life of John the Baptist, of Saints Nazarus and 
Celsus, of the life, death, and legendary history 
of the Virgin, of the life of Saint Lazarus, of the 
martyrdom of Saint Leodegarius, shepherds and 
the heavenly host, scenes of the Nativity and the 
life of Christ, life of Saint Malachi. and of the 
Office for the Dead, besides several hundred dec- 
orative large and small initials and textual orna- 
ments. It is evident that scribe, designer, and

decorator combined to produce a work of gorgeous- 
ness, the designs and decoration being evidently the 
work of the most eminent artists of the period. 
Two large miniatures occur before the Canon, one 
representing the Crucifixion and the other the Deity 
enshrined, a full-length figure in flowing robes of 
gold, with cherubim and seraphim behind the 
throne. Each of these miniatures is surrounded 
by deep borders of flowers and fruit, in which are 
introduced remarkable, grotesque figures and ani- 
mals, having in the lower margin an emblazoned 
coat-of-arms of a prince bishop, supported by 
angels, beneath which is a Maltese cross. Other 
fine and large miniatures represent the three Marys 
at the sepulchre, the ascension of Christ, Pentecost, 
Christ celebrating the Eucharist with His disciples, 
the Trinity enthroned in heaven, the Nativity, and 
the offering of the Magi. 

Two interesting letters of John Adams and John 
Quincy Adams have come into the possession of 
Patrick F. Madigan, of New York, who believes 
that they are unpublished. The letter of John 
Adams was written when he was vice-president 
under Washington, to General Winthrop Sargent, 
prominent in the Indian wars, 1791-5, and gov- 
ernor of the Southwestern Territory. The letter 
of John Quincy Adams was written when he was 
United States senator, and as a Federalist, to 
William Smith Shaw, nephew and private secre- 
tary of John Adams. The letter of John Adams 
is as follows, with his capitalization, etc.: 

Dear Sir- Philadelphia, January 24, 1795. 

I have received your favour of the 30th of No- 
vember, and transmitted to Dr. Belknap, as you desire, 
the papers inclosed. The Utensils aud ornaments 
represented in the Drawings are great curiosities, 
and seem to show more skill in Arts, than any of 
the native Indians, at this day, are possessed of. 
I am not enough in the habit of Antiquarian specu- 
lations to hazard any conjectures concerning them. 
I have never interested myself much in the inquiries 
concerning the ancient Inhabitants of this country, 
or the part of the world from which they first emi- 
grated. I should not be at all surprised, if here- 
after evidence should be discovered that America was 
once a Seat of Arts, Science and civilization: nor 
should I wonder if any one should prophecy that 
Europe, will cease to be what it is. and become as 
savage and barbarous as America was three hun- 
dred years ago. The temper and Principles pre- 
vailing at present in that quarter of the world have 
a tendency to as general and total a destruction, as 
ever befell Tyre and Sodom and Gemorah. If all 
Religion and governments, all arts and pioneers are 
destroyed the trees will grow up, Cities will moulder 
into common earth and a few human beings may be 
left naked to chase the wild beasts with Bows and 
arrows. 

Printing they say will prevent it But it would be 
very consistent with the present professed Principles 
to destroy every Type and Press as Engines of Aris- 
tocracy, and murder every Pen and Ink man as 
aiming at Superiority. 

I hope in all events that religion and learning will 
find an Asylum in America: but too many of our 
fellow citizens are carried away in the dirty Tor- 
rent of dissolving Europe. 

I thank you Sir for giving me an opportunity to 
see those Antiquities, and should be glad to see any 
others that may appear. I am Sir with great esteem, 
your most obedient John Adams.

Messrs. Frederick A. Stokes Co. have received 
a request for permission to translate "I, Mary

Edith Wherry, author of "The Wanderer on a 
Thousand Hills" (Lane), is a daughter of one of 
the oldest living American missionaries to China. 
Her father was one of the besieged in the famous 
Siege of Peking in 1900, and his cablegram was the 
first news to be received in New York of the 
safety of the foreigners after the lifting of the 
siege. 

The Brooklyn Public Library has sent out some 
miniature catalogues entitled: "Doing Your Bit," 
"National Defense," "Book Helps For Munition 
Workers," and "The Ship-Builder's Library," in

be of service to present-day patriots. In "Doing 
Your Bit," for instance, the books are classified 
under the heads "Food Gardening," "Canning and 
Preserving," "Poultry Keeping," "Household Econ- 
omy," "Feeding the Family," "Meatless Cookery," 
and "Thrift in General."

Ernest A. Boyd, the author of "The Contempo- 
rary Drama of Ireland" (Little, Brown), formerly 
the British consul at Baltimore, who was instru- 
mental in introducing his friend Lord Dunsany to 
America, is at work on a volume of essays at his 
home in Dublin. 

The story of Jean Jaures, democrat and inter- 
nationalist, who was assassinated on the eve of 
the war, his active relation to the Dreyfus trial, 
to the severance of Church and State in France, 
and to the fight for social liberty and justice, are 
told in a volume entitled "Jean Jaures: Socialist 
and Humanitarian," by Margaret Pease. There is 
a foreword by J. Ramsay MacDonald, the leader 
of the Socialists in the House of Commons. The 
book has just been published by B. W. Huebsch. 

Early autumn publications from Messrs. E. P. 
Dutton & Co. include: "The Book of the West 
Indies," by E. Hyatt Verrill; "Army and Navy

Jones and His Exploits in English Seas," by Don 
C. Seitz; "Civilized Commercialism," by Ernest G. 
Stevens ; "The Book of Home Nursing," by Frances

the Threshold of the Unseen; An Examination 
of the Phenomena of Spiritualism and of the Evi- 
dence for Survival after Death," by Sir William F. 
Barrett; "America's Case Against Germany," by 
Lindsay Rogers. 

August 13 marked the forty-sixth birthday of 
Dr. Karl Liebknecht, the Socialist member of the 
Reichstag, whose unswerving loyalty to his prin- 
ciples is responsible for his present imprisonment 
in Germany, an experience which is not new to 
him. The first important occasion on which 
he went to jail was when he published his book, 
"Militarism," which the German government sup- 
pressed. An authorized translation of that work 
is announced for early publication by B. W. 
Huebsch. Nothing reveals so clearly and dis- 
tinctly the implications of military rule and a large 
standing army as this volume, one of the greatest 
pleas for democracy that has come out of Germany. 

A charming fall title is "There's Pippins and 
Cheese to Come." It belongs to a book by Charles 
S. Brooks, author of "Journeys to Bagdad," and is 
announced for October by the Yale University Press.

Proverbs," by Nathan Bailey; "The Undying Spirit

History of the United States 
Political - Industrial - Social 

By CHARLES M. THOMPSON 

Associate Professor of Economics 

University of Illinois 

This book rescues the subject from its 
dismemberment into the two parts, polit- 
ical on the one hand and industrial-social 
on the other, and gives a complete and well- 
proportioned history of our country from 
both points of view. To bring the eco- 
nomic and the political history of the 
United States into close connection is a 
thing of such vital importance that the 
wonder is that it has not been done before. 

The book is announced for publication 
August 2^, 1917.

This is the simple, direct narrative by a young 
English officer of his brief but intense experience 
at the front in the battle of the Somme. in which 
he was blinded and captured, and of his life in 
German hospitals and prison camps until released 
as unfit for service. No other book gives any 
such realisation of an officer's duties and responsi- 
bilities in the field and in battle, nor is there any 
such a picture of life as a German prisoner of war.

My War Diary 

By Madame Waddington 

Madame Waddington, who, as all readers know, 
has described with rare vividness almost every phase 
of the brilliant social and political life she has taken 
part in, could not fail when she turned to the yean 
of the war to make a chronicle of almost unique 
interest. To her real genius for writing the memoirs 
of her time she adds here the intense feeling of a

France have virtually made her of a mother and 
the head of a home. $1.60 net

Plays by Alexander Ostrovsky 

A Protegee of the Mistress, Poverty Is No Crime, 
Sin and Sorrow Are Common to All, and It's a 
Family Affair. 

Translated from the Russian under the editorial 
supervision of GEORGE R. NOYES, Professor of 
Slavic Languages at the University of California. 
Ostrovsky is one of the most significant figures in 
Russian literature. He was a genuine originator, 
for he brought upon a stage that had previously 
dealt only with the nobility and the officials that 
great middle class of the merchant and the small 
landowner, which is so much more characteristically 
Russian, and so dealt with the realities of Russian 
life. The four plays in this volume are representa- 
tive. They combine to impress a curiously vivid 
sense of the Russian character. $1.50 net 

The Poems of H. C. Bunner 

"It is perhaps as a poet that the author of 'Airs 
of Arcady' is likely longest to be remembered ; and 
it is as a poet that he would have chosen to be 
cherished in men's memories. . . His verse has the 
form, the finish, the flavor of scholarship that the 
cultivated recognize and relish ; and it has also the 
freshness, the spontaneity, the heartiness, and the 
human sympathy, wanting which no poetry has ever 
been welcome outside the narrow circle of the dilet- 
tanti." From Brander Matthews's Introduction.

The Ways of War

This is a collection of war writings by the most 
brilliant member of the "Young Ireland" group. 
"Why Ireland Fought" is a splendid piece of rea-

Ireland. Among other sections are "Under the Heel 
of the Hun" and "Silhouettes from the Front."

A Social Theory of Religious, 
Education 

By GEORGE ALBERT COE, Professor in the 

Union Theological Seminary, New York. 

This volume is an attempt to answer the question, 
"What consequences for religious education follow 
from the now widely accepted social interpretation of 
the Christian message?" 

The thesis of the book is developed with the utmost 
thoroughness from the philosophical, psychological, 
and practical standpoint. The author shows how 
his theory should be applied and what startling 
changes it would involve in the family, in the 
Sunday-school, and in the work of the church as a 
whole. $1.50 net 

Concerning Painting

cerning Painting," which is of equal interest and 
value to general reader and student. Its first part is 
a thoughtful and intelligent discussion of the ques-

Conscience and Intelligence in War 



The merely "conscientious objector" 
has absorbed too much attention from 
those who are concerned about under- 
standing the non-popularity of our par- 
ticipation in the war. Not all the pacifist 
feeling has had an evangelical color. 
There is an element of anti-war sentiment 
which has tried to be realistic, and does 
not hope to defeat war merely by not do- 
ing something. Though events have been 
manipulated against it, this element neither 
welcomes martyrdom nor hopes to be 
saved for its amiable sentiments. And it 
is just this attitude, far more significantly 
"American" than "conscientious objec- 
tion," that John Dewey has ignored in his 
recent article on "Conscience and Compul- 
sion." The result has been to apply his 
pragmatic philosophy in its least convinc- 
ing form. 

His criticism is of the merely good and 
merely conscientious souls whose moral 
training has emphasized sentiments rather 
than specific purposes, and who are al- 
ways found helpless before the coercion 
of events. His argument follows the well- 
known lines of his instrumental use of the 
intelligence for the realization of conscious 
social purpose. The conscience, he im- 
plies, is balked by an unpleasant situation, 
is futile unless it attaches itself to forces 
moving in another, and more desirable, 
direction. Dissatisfied with the given 
means or end, one chooses another alter- 
native, either a new end to which the 
means may be shaped, or a new means 
to effect the desired end. But in apply- 
ing this theory to the war situation, 
does not the philosopher ignore the fact 
that it is exactly in war that alternatives 
are rigorously limited? Is not war per- 
haps the one social absolute, the one situ- 
ation where the choice of ends ceases to 
function? Obviously in a world of choice 
one may hope intelligently to select and 
manipulate some social mechanism by 
which a desired social arrangement may 



be brought about. But war always comes 
to seem just that urgent, inevitable crisis 
of the nation's life where everything must 
be yielded to one purpose. For a few 
months, the public may retain the illusion 
of freedom, of mastery over social forces. 
But as war continues, there comes the deep 
popular recognition that there is now but 
one end victory; and but one means 
the organization of all the resources of 
the nation into a conventional war tech- 
nique. "Peace without victory" becomes 
a logical and biological contradiction. 
Belligerent peoples will have long ago re- 
alized that war is its own end, and that, 
to paraphrase a popular ditty, they fight 
because they fight because they fight. This 
was the real basis of the opposition to the 
President's gesture for peace the reali- 
zation that though America might still be 
living in a pragmatic world, war had made 
Europe a realm of the absolute. And in 
our own country, war had not been with 
us for ten weeks before "peace without 
victory" changed officially into "conquer 
or submit!" 

In wartime, there is literally no other 
end but war, and the objector, therefore, 
lives no longer with a choice of alterna- 
tives. The pacifist conscience attaches 
itself to no end because no end exists 
which connects with its desires. Plans and 
programmes may exist which have not to 
do with war, but they exist only in the 
realm of fantasy, not in the realm of prac- 
tical politics. Peace comes through vic- 
tory or exhaustion, and not through 
creative intelligence. The appeal to force 
removes everything automatically to a 
non-intelligent sphere of thinking and act- 
ing. Mr. Dewey is depressed at the num- 
ber of conscientious young men who 
exchanged their "Thou shalt not kill" into 
an "Obey the law," though they saw the 
situation exactly as before. But his de- 
pression is due only to that inexorability 
which every pragmatist must resent. It is 



194 



THE DIAL 



[September 13 



not just to be depressed at their poverty 
of imagination. For he is dealing with 
precisely the one situation in which his 
philosophy will no longer work. He im- 
plies that there was some way by which 
conscience could operate very differently 
from that whose main concern is to "re- 
main itself unspotted from within." 
Well, in what way? Where does one find 
"forces moving in another direction"? 
One may find forces moving against the 
war, resisting the organization for war, 
agitating for a speedy peace. But such 
forces are not merely alternative social 
policies. They are not morally equivalent 
to the policy of war. They have the 
unique quality of disloyalty. They chal- 
lenge the entire force of the nation. As 
soon as they threaten to become at all ef- 
fective, they are automatically crushed 
out, under even the most democratic of 
governments. Never has a government 
in wartime been known to refuse the use 
of relentless coercion against "forces mov- 
ing in another direction." The attaching 
of one's conscience to any such forces is 
infallibly taken to be the allying of one- 
self with the disloyal, and the inadvertent 
aiding of the nation's enemies. There is, 
of course, the alternative of revolution, 
which would have much the same effect 
as disloyalty. Does Mr. Dewey mean to 
urge the "conscientious objector" to take 
to disloyalty or revolution in his efforts to 
attach his conscience to intelligent alterna- 
tives? And if not, will he tell us what 
social mechanism he knows of that is con- 
sidered relevant or even permissible in 
wartime that does not contribute to the 
war technique? One resists or one obeys. 
If one resists, one is martyred or coerced. 
If one obeys, the effect is just as if one 
accepted the war. 

In wartime, then, one's pragmatic con- 
science moves in a vacuum. There is no 
leverage to clutch. To a philosopher of 
the creative intelligence, the fact that war 
blots out the choice of ends and even of 
means should be the final argument against 
its use as a technique for any purpose 
whatever. War once entered upon, 
neither means nor ends can really be re- 
vised or altered. The acceptance of the 
war by Mr. Dewey can only be explained 
by the prevailing sentiment that this was 



a war in which we had to be. I have 
heard him say that it was far better to 
enter the war intelligently than blindly or 
hysterically. This is not quite the same 
as saying that deliberate murder is more 
creatively intelligent than murder commit- 
ted in the heat of sudden passion. For 
what Mr. Dewey meant was probably 
that if we entered the war intelligently 
we would choose the ends which the war 
technique might serve. But is it not a 
little curious to find the men who thought 
the war inevitable "what could we do?" 
and who could neither prevent it nor 
devise an alternative, still confident that 
they can control its terrible force for be- 
neficent purposes? Having accepted the 
inevitable of war, one can more easily ac- 
cept other inevitables. 

At the back of Mr. Dewey's mind was 
perhaps the hope that the pacifist con- 
science, though hating war and everything 
connected with it, might aid this war be- 
cause of the radical social reforms it was 
sure to bring. But the same people who 
thought of this as an end for which the 
pacifist should be willing to accept the in- 
strument, are now complaining that labor, 
though it consecrated itself to the nation's 
service, is not now receiving the nation's 
gratitude; that the war-swollen fortune is 
sliding free of paying for the war; that 
education is being impoverished, and 
national demoralization rather than inte- 
gration taking place. These ironic frustra- 
tions of the social purpose were foreseen 
by the realistic pacifists. They were the 
best of reasons for finding an alternative 
to war. They were the best of motives 
for not attaching one's conscience to 
forces that involved a technique which in- 
fallibly trailed along these social evils. 
Once you accept war, there is no choice 
but to be shoved along the line of inev- 
itables with which war is organically 
bound up. 

In wartime, therefore, the "forces 
moving in another direction," to which 
Mr. Uewey invites the objecting con- 
science to attach itself, are illusory. War 
is just that absolute situation which is its 
own end and its own means, and which 
speedily outstrips the power of intelligent 
and creative control. As long as you are 
out of war, events remain to some degree 



1917] 



THE DIAL

malleable. This was the argument for 
"armed neutrality." But clamp down the 
psychic pattern of war on the nation, and 
you have precipitated an absolute where 
mastery becomes a mockery. Mere con- 
scientious objection in wartime is not so 
uncreative or unintelligent as Mr. Dewey 
represents it. No social machinery exists 
to make dissent effective. Alternative 
ends are illusory. You can only accept, 
or rebel, or remain apathetic. This is not 
true of other social situations. It is true 
of war. If you are skeptical of the tech- 
nique of war, or of the professed aims, 
a negative attitude is the only possible one. 
It may not be noble to cencentrate on your 
own integrity, but it is perhaps better than 
to be a hypocrite or a martyr. And if 
pragmatists like Mr. Dewey are going to 
accept "inevitables," you at least have an 
equal right to choose what shall seem in- 
evitable to you. 

To many pragmatists the impotence of 
the pacifists in the period preceding the 
war has been a sore point. They are 
scolded for their lack of organization and 
their mere obstructiveness. Actually, they 
were fertile in constructive suggestions. 
But no social machinery existed for har- 
nessing their conscience to action. The 
referendum would have been a slight dem- 
ocratic clutch. It was hooted out of court. 
Armed neutrality was foozled. The 
forces that were irresistibly for war had 
control of the war-making machinery. 
The pacifists sounded ridiculous and un- 
reasonable, because the drive was the 
other way. The war suction had begun. 
Choices were already abolished, and the 
most realistic and constructive pacifism in 
the world would have been helpless. 

In all this chain of events, those minds 
were able to retain a feeling of alternative 
forces and of free choice which were in 
sympathy with the announced purpose of 
the war and not temporarily hostile to its 
technique. The philosophy of creative 
intelligence still seemed to be working be- 
cause there was no need to test its appli- 
cability. The dissenter, however, felt 
cruelly the coercive forces. Suppose I 
really believe that world peace will more 
likely come exactly "by not doing some- 
thing," by a collusive neglect of imperial- 



istic policy on the new Russian model. 
Suppose I believe that a federalism of sov- 
ereign nations will only mean more com- 
petitive wars. What forces are there then 
to which I can assimilate this war of ours, 
and so make my intelligence and con- 
science count for what little they may? 
Is not Mr. Dewey's case against the 
merely passive built on an assumption 
that if one chose freely one would choose 
the present inevitable forces? But the 
mind that is skeptical of these present 
forces, is it not thrown back to a choice 
of resistance or apathy? Can one do more 
than wait and hope for wisdom when the 
world becomes pragmatic and flexible

RANDOLPH BOURNE. 



An Artist of the Supernormal 

Ever since Henry James's horrible 
ghost story, "The Turn of the Screw," the 
supernormal has had an increasing interest 
for the literary psychologist. Apparitions 
of the living and the dead are no longer 
confined to romance and fantasy or to 
the records of the Society for Psychical Re- 
search. They may be found in strictly 
realistic fiction, such as Edith Wharton's 
powerful short story, "The Triumph of 
Night," or Ellen Glasgow's "Shadowy 
Third." Professor L. P. Jacks adds phi- 
losophy to psychological analysis in his 
fascinating stories, and particularly in his 
book, "All Men Are Ghosts," argues, 
with delightful humor, that ourselves and 
our realities may seem like illusions to 
those in other existences. But as a serious 
adventurer in the country of the supernor- 
mal, not one of these writers appears quite 
so courageous as May Sinclair. 

It was fitting that Miss Sinclair should 
give us, in "The Three Brontes," the com- 
pletely satisfying interpretation of Emjly 
Bronte's mysticism and poetry, for she 
herself is one of the few realistic writers 
in contemporary English fiction who is also 
a poet and mystic. "Naked, shining, in- 
tense reality," to quote the writer's own 
words, is what she seeks to discover in her 
art; and she goes about her work, not 
heavily and solemnly, but with a serious- 
ness all lightened by humor, and a ridicule

THE DIAL 



[September 13 



which rarely fails to penetrate our little 
human absurdities. There is nothing of 
the comic spirit, however, in Miss Sin- 
clair's extraordinary adventures in the su- 
pernormal "The Flaw in the Crystal" 
and "The Intercessor." All her tragic 
power is here compressed into two neg- 
lected stories, unique in fiction. 

"The Flaw in the Crystal" concerns 
a strange case of mental healing, and the 
discovery by the healer through a tragic 
experience that in order to accomplish her 
intention she must remain absolutely pas- 
sionless and impersonal. The crystal, in 
the words of the symbol, must be flawless. 
Yet, when this book was published five 
years ago by a venturesome American 
publisher, "hopeless immorality," "neu- 
rotic femininity," "amazing twaddle," was 
about all our reviewers found to say of a 
story whose purity of motive, exquisite 
balance, and precision of style are its most 
obvious qualities. They seemed quite un- 
aware, with a very few exceptions, that 
May Sinclair had accomplished a literary 
feat of amazing delicacy and power. 

There are visions of mystic beauty in 
Miss Sinclair's later work, none more ra- 
diant than the one recorded in her "Jour- 
nal of Impressions in Belgium," a vision 
of tranquil and supernatural loveliness in 
the midst of human horror and despair. 
But the most extraordinary, in the present 
writer's opinion, is the brief experience of 
joyous reality given to Agatha Verrall, the 
psychic and healer, as she stands on the 
edge of the silent woods looking down a 
steep ploughed field in early spring. The 
man beside her, she has cured of mad- 
ness of the haunting Terror which has 
driven him indoors to sit crouching in his 
chair, with blinds drawn and locked door. 
Now, in the full assurance of his recovery, 
Harding Powell is out of doors, receptive 
to the wonder and beauty of spring. 
Agatha has demonstrated her fitness as an 
instrument of the inscrutable healing pow- 
er. She is happy purely in the sense of 
having helped. To quote in part: 

At that moment, in a flash that came like a shift- 
ing of her eyes, the world she looked at suffered a 
change. 

And yet it did not change. All the appearance 
of things, their colours, the movement and the still- 
ness remained as if constant in their rhythm and 



their scale; but they were heightened, intensified; 
they were carried to a pitch that would have been 
vehement, vibrant, but that the stillness as well as 
the movement was intense . . . 

She would have said now that the earth at her 
feet had become insubstantial, but that she knew, in 
her flash, that what she saw was the very substance 
of the visible world; live and subtle as flame; solid 
as crystal and as clean. It was the same world, 
flat field for flat field and hill for hill; but radiant, 
vibrant, and, as it were, infinitely transparent. 

Agatha in her moment saw that the whole world 
brimmed and shone and was alive with the joy 
that was its life, joy that flowed flood-high and 
yet was still. In every leaf, in every blade of 
grass, this life was manifest as a strange, a divine 
translucence. She was about to point it out to the 
man at her side when she remembered that he had 
eyes for the beauty of the earth, but no sense of its 
secret and supernatural light. Harding Powell de- 
nied, he always had denied the supernatural. And 
when she turned to him her vision had passed from 
her. 

The complete reversal of this joyous 
experience is shown in another and horri- 
ble vision when Agatha, because she has 
failed to hold herself passionless and im- 
personal in her healings, and, to save the 
man whom she loves, has abandoned Har- 
ding Powell, is haunted by the latter and 
takes on his madness. Then, it is not the 
joy but the horror imminent in the life of 
things which she experiences: 

She saw the world in a loathsome transparency; 
she saw it with the eye of a soul in which no sense 
of the divine had ever been, of a soul that denied 
the supernatural. It had been Harding Powell's 
soul, and it had become hers. 

Furiously, implacably, he was getting at her. 

Out of the wood and the hedges that bordered 
it there came sounds that were horrible, because 
she knew them to be inaudible to any ear less 
charged with insanity; small sounds of movement, 
of strange shiverings, swarmings, crepitations; 
sounds of incessant, infinitely subtle urging, of 
agony and recoil. . . She heard the stirring of the 
corruption that Life was; the young blades of corn 
were frightful to her, for in them was the push, 
the passion of the evil which was Life; the trees 
as they stretched out their arms and threatened her 
were frightful with the terror which was Life. . . 

All this she perceived in a flash. . . It sank into 
stillness and grew dim; she was aware of it only 
as the scene, the region in which one thing, her 
terror, moved and hunted her. Among sounds of 
the rustling of leaves, and the soft crush of grass. 
and the whirring of little wings in fright, she heard 
it go ; it went on the other side of the hedge, a little 
\\--.\\- behind her as she skirted the wood. She stood 
still to let it pass her, and she felt that it passed, 
and that it stopped and waited. A terrified bird 
flew out of the hedge, no further than a fledgling's 
flight in front of her. And in that place it flrw 
from she saw Harding Powell. 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



197 



The apparition, born of Agatha's fear, 
drifts away and is dissolved. She recov- 
ers herself and is released from the haunt- 
ing Terror; but having discovered the 
cause of her imperfection, she sends the 
man whom she loves, and who is already 
married to another, away from her with 
the gentle inflexibility of the true mystic. 
"His hand was on the door. He smiled 
back at her. 'I don't want to shake your 
faith in it,' he said. 'You can't shake my 
faith in it.' 'Still it breaks down. It 
breaks down,' he cried. 'Never. You 
don't understand,' she said. 'It was the 
flaw in the crystal.' ' 

Such analysis of the supernormal is 
surely one of the most difficult and danger- 
ous things a writer could undertake. So 
easily it might have led Miss Sinclair into 
the extravagant and fantastic, the inco- 
herent or hysterical; but what she manages 
somehow to convey, with consummate art, 
is a sense of reality. 

Since "The Turn of the Screw," with 
the exception of Mrs. Wharton's "Tri- 
umph of Night," no such puzzling and 
gruesome subject has been undertaken in 
English fiction as May Sinclair's solitary 
ghost story, "The Intercessor," published 
in the "English Review." In "The Turn 
of the Screw" and "The Triumph of 
Night," it is the powers of darkness which 
bring forth the apparitions of the living 
and the dead. Henry James stops at hor- 
ror multiple horror; Mrs. Wharton at 
triumphant crime. In "The Intercessor," 
it is only through evil and suffering that 
the veil is rent between the worlds, but 
May Sinclair more gently makes the su- 
pernormal event the means by which the 
evil is banished. 

Among the realistic tragedies of child- 
hood in our literature, there can be noth- 
ing more poignant than this sobbing 
phantom of the little dead girl wandering 
about the desolate farmhouse where she 
has been neglected and abused by the 
mother whom she loves; striking terror to 
the hearts of all within that brutish house- 
hold until, through the mediation of a 
stranger, one who is pitiful and unafraid, 
the intercessor, comes reconciliation. The 
mother is saved from madness, and the 
child's sorrow and passion are appeased. 



To make of this strange and unbelievable 
story a work of naked, tragic reality, re- 
quires a peculiar combination of psychic 
and artistic gifts which May Sinclair has 
developed beyond all the other English 
fiction-writers of our day. 

"The Flaw in the Crystal" and "The 
Intercessor" are, of course, only the occa- 
sional adventures of a gifted realist and 
psychologist, the bulk of whose work is 
concerned almost entirely with normal, 
everyday life. It is quite certain, how- 
ever, that before the war they were not 
mere "interludes" in Miss Sinclair's more 
serious fiction (the hope expressed by one 
dissatisfied reviewer). They were a grow- 
ing preoccupation. 

From contemplation of the external 
world, its ugly materialism, what she de- 
liberately sweeps aside as the "whole ob- 
structive apparatus of material things," 
Miss Sinclair was turning to seek a deeper 
reality and the supernormal fascinated 
her. She was an individualist and a mys- 
tic, quite detached from social and political 
movements, except woman suffrage (a 
rather large exception ! ) . Then came the 
war. Gallant and militant, Miss Sinclair 
was one of the few women writers to sign 
the British authors' declaration of loyalty 
to democratic ideals of government, and 
she went into active service as a volunteer 
in one of the first British field-ambulance 
corps to enter Flanders. She witnessed 
the ferocious militarism of the German 
invasion of Belgium. Those seventeen 
days spent under the "curved lightning" of 
the German shells and bomb-dropping 
aeroplanes, so scrupulously recorded in 
her "Journal," and later in "The Belfry," 
must have an incalculable effect on her 
work. Will it become less individualistic? 
A stronger social purpose would strength- 
en its reality. 

Miss Sinclair has shown our social phi- 
losophers in fiction, the value of psycho- 
logical subtlety, of delicacy combined with 
courage in the presentation of erotic 
themes, of fidelity to the individual life. 
May not their insistence on the supreme 
importance of social analysis and vision 
have its value for her now? Or will she 
react in these violent times, and find that 
the mystic and lyrical forces which move

us still have their most interesting and 
significant manifestations in elemental and 
personal emotions? 

One thing, however, seems certain. 
May Sinclair is one of the English novel- 
ists who will survive Armageddon. Her 
genius cannot be so shattered. But it is 
quite possible that after the extremity of 
social wrong and human anguish which she 
now witnesses, her adventures in the super- 
normal will be discontinued, and that such 
stories as "The Intercessor" and "The 
Flaw in the Crystal," will have no succes-

The Gospel of Internationalism 

A LEAGUE OF NATIONS. By Henry Noel Brails- 
ford. (Macmillan Co.; $1.75.) 

Fully to appreciate the wisdom, insight, and 
dignity of Mr. Brailsford's book one should con- 
trast it with the boiling mess of polemical litera- 
ture which is still being brewed on both sides of 
the long fighting line. I have just glanced 
through an ill-tempered and ignoble work by the 
Right Honorable J. M. Robertson, M.P., in 
reply to an inept and inflated book by Professor 
Eduard Meyer, of the University of Berlin.* 
Both the German and the Englishman are full 
of hatred, insult, intellectual unfairness, canting 
overpraise for their own nation, and uncritical 
condemnation of their opponent. They deal in 
ugly epithets and smart, stinging rejoinders that 
might win the applause of a primary school. 
Their vision is fastened on war, now and here- 
after, and on the taunting supremacy of the 
German over the Britisher and of the Britisher 
over the German. "Buried," says Dr. Meyer, 
"are all the dreams of the well-meaning vision- 
aries concerning an eternal peace of the nations. 
. . Instead of everlasting peace, a series of 
long and bloody wars will be the mark of the 
new century. . . The era of international- 
ism is past and will never return. . . We 
Germans have long enough given ourselves up 
to the folly of believing it possible by friendly 
overtures to win the honest friendship of other 
nations." Ha! ha! laughs the Right Honor- 
able J. M. Robertson, M.P., "The Allies 
. . . will not leave it in the power of a per- 
verted nation again to endanger the general life

of man. Henceforth the German Wolf will 
be chained." 

Mr. Brailsford insults no one, impugns no 
one's inoti\rs. M-rk> no merely nationalistic inter- 
pretation of this war, and does not attempt to 
assume the role of Supreme Judge between the 
nations. He is looking not backward to Sera- 
jevo and the invasion of Belgium but forward to 
the treaty of the peace which is to come and to 
the decades of world reorganization in which that 
peace is to be made really effective. The ques- 
tion which he faces with wisdom and courage is 
lio\v the coming war-settlement can promote the 
cause of international organization and how the 
League of Nations, proposed by President 
Wilson, can secure to all peoples effective guaran- 
tees of future peace and healthy national develop- 
ment. In working out this problem upon the 
basis of a candid consideration of a vast mass 
of material Mr. Brailsford arrives at the con- 
clusion that the time is now ripe for the insti- 
tution of the League, that we cannot afford to 
wait ten years or even five for hostile passions 
to cool, that the programme though difficult is 
feasible, that the League must be all-inclusive, 
and that it cannot be successful unless Germany 
and Austria are invited to membership. In other 
words, Mr. Brailsford does not believe with Dr. 
Meyer that Germany is a forlorn pilgrim who 
must forever defend himself against the wiles 
and lusts of a world of envious rivals. Nor 
does he agree with the Right Honorable J. M. 
Robertson that progress consists in "chaining the 
German Wolf." Instead he works out with 
great ability a tentative peace agreement and a 
provisional outline of the League which is to be 
constituted among the nations. 

At bottom the difference between men like Mr. 
Brailsford and hot controversialists like Professor 
Meyer and Mr. Robertson is that the former are 
seeking large ends and are not concerned with 
making out a case against individuals or with 
indicting in advance of the facts a whole nation. 
Mr. Brailsford sees deeper. "We set out," he 
"to destroy Prussian militarism. It will be 
destroyed at the moment when a German govern- 
ment pledges itself to enter a League based on 
arbitration and conciliation. Short of that wr 
may slaughter Prussians, but we cannot destroy 
militarism." In other words, the battle-field is 
but a preliminary to the real business of the 
war. "Defeat means our failure to achieve inter- 
national organization, and victory means our 
success." 



1917] 



THE DIAL

In a former book, "The War of Steel and 
Gold," Mr. Brailsford described the vast con- 
flict between the nations which was going on in 
peace times. It was partly to escape this con- 
flict, and the dead weight of outlived conditions 
of which it was an expression, that the nations 
flew to arms. The war, concludes Mr. Brails- 
ford in the present book, "sprang from many 
passionate resolves to extort change from destiny. 
It was an act of insurgence against the death in 
life which acquiesces in hampered conditions and 
unsolved problems." The evil in Europe, which 
gave rise to this war, was "the inertia, the im- 
potence, the suspicion, the lack of social sense 
which stood in the way of these necessary 
changes. The way of hope is not in the retro- 
spective moralizings which distribute blame and 
to blame would add punishment," but in the 
acceptance of impulses and in a new spirit of 
adjustment and compromise and faith. The new 
world "will come when each nation turns to its 
fellow and speaks, though it be still in bewilder- 
ment and pain, the wish to create the cooperative 
world in which all may live and grow."

THE SOUL OF THE RUSSIAN. By Marjorie and 
Alan Lethbridge. (John Lane Co.; $1.25.) 
THE SLAVS OF THE WAR ZONE. By Wm. F. 
Bailey, C. B. (E. P. Button & Co.; $3.50.) 
THE RUSSIANS: An Interpretation. By Richard- 
son Wright. (F. A. Stokes Co.; $1.50.) 

Under the somewhat pretentious title that 
heads this article, Marjorie and Alan Leth- 
bridge have collected a number of stray essays 
inspired by their travels in Russia. There is no 
doubt that the authors were ill-advised in choos- 
ing for their book a name which promises far 
more than they endeavor to fulfil. In this case, 
the title is more than a misnomer; it is a verit- 
able boomerang. It arouses great expectations 
which a reading of the essays quickly dissipates, 
leaving the reader disgruntled and somewhat 
disinclined to praise the good things that the 
book contains. This is most unfortunate, for 
"The Soul of the Russian" is not without its 
merits. Though the work is a collection of short, 
miscellaneous sketches written with very little 
distinction of style, it is, nevertheless, a sincere 
attempt to represent certain phases of Russian 
life. As such, it will have something to give to 
the general reader. The essays fall into three 



groups: historical or antiquarian bits, articles 
inspired by the war, and descriptions of persons 
and places. Some are flat and unprofitable, 
others merely quaint and curious; a few are 
illuminating brief flashes that reveal some- 
thing of the Russian "soul." 

A different purpose animates Mr. W. F. 
Bailey in "The Slavs of the War Zone." His 
desire is to give "a vivid and accurate account 
of the countries in which the Slav races dwell 
to give a description of their habits and cus- 
toms; of how they live at home, among their 
neighbours, and in their market places; of their 
dress, their amusements and , their festivals ; of 
their music, their songs and their dances; of 
their views of life, their joys and their sorrows; 
of their political, national and religious aspira- 
tions; of how the great war found them and 
how it leaves them." The author attempts to 
cover the vast territory between the Russian 
steppes and the Adriatic Sea, pausing wherever 
there are people of the Slav race, no matter 
under what name their ethnic descent is now 
hidden. Mr. Bailey's interest is in the Slav 
race; to him race kinship is a reality that sets 
at naught the disintegrating forces of variety 
of languages, social and environmental differ- 
ences, interracial affiliations, and neighborly 
comities. All these are laughed to scorn by the 
ordained ethnic grouping, by the mystic ties of 
blood. "When the history of the origin of the 
present war comes to be written," says Mr. 
Bailey, "it will probably be conceded that it 
was mainly due to the clash of interests between 
the Teutonic and Slav peoples." 

"The Russians: An Interpretation" is the 
work of a man who has a deep affection for 
the Russian people and a knowledge of the grave 
problems that Russia will have to face in the 
near future. Unfortunately, much in Mr. 
Wright's interesting volume has become "anti- 
quated" in view of the great strides that the 
country has made in the last four months. But 
the book will prove of value to that large sec- 
tion of the American reading public which seeks 
reliable information about an unknown coun- 
try, information given in clear, understandable 
terms. 

It has become the fashion to speak of the Rus- 
sians as a "soulful" people. , Writers like Ste- 
phen Graham have journeyed to the country of 
the vast plain, determined to experience delect- 
able and mystic joys. Far be it from me to

remove the veils that shroud secluded mysteries. 
This is a form of iconoclasm from which I 
shrink. But it seems to me that some of us are 
in a fair way to forget that Russia, as Kipling 
said, is not the most Eastern of European, but 
the most Western of Eastern, nations. The 
Russians themselves are far too diffident to be- 
lieve the solemn things that the literary band of 
devotees says about them. With unconscious 
irony, the peasants of Russia have for genera- 
tions been raising the worldly cry, "Land and 
Liberty," that Russian equivalent of "No Tax- 
ation without Representation." And it will be 
impossible to them that they are sell- 

ing their souls for > of pottage. As they 

see it, they are trying to keep their birthright 
intact. Nor can they conceive that with the 
attainment of liberty will come the surrender 
of their faith or the gradual atrophy of the 
racial and inherent traits that go to make up 
the Russian "soul." Liberty transforms a 
people only in the sense that it makes them true 
to their inner nature. Through liberty alone 
is the great apocalypse of a nation made manifest 
to those who can see and understand. 

Into the Russian heart there has entered the 
poignant melancholy, the subtle and compelling 
power of the vast, level, monotonous plain which 
took centuries to conquer. The Russian char- 
acter is linked, in its qualities and its defects, 
to the plain of Russia. The emotional expansive- 
ness of the Russians, their spiritual eagerness that 
knows no bounds, their reaching out for full 
freedom of body and mind, is natural to a people 
who have the consciousness of space, the knowl- 
edge of far vistas and distant horizons. They 
are led to extremes of all kinds, but they are 
led by a sense of sin that gives them no rest, 
by a deep faith that truth exists and can be 
attained. And perhaps, because of the tragic 
earnestness of their search, the Russians have 
come upon the right way, for, in the words of 
Alexei Tolstoy, they seek "to embrace Nature, 
brothers, foes and friends." 

The Russians have been accused of not being 
"practical." I have often asked myself by what 
signs one is to know a practical people. It 
seems to be the belief in our country, if one is 
to judge by the liturgy of success in certain of 
our popular magazines, that in order to be 
marked by this coveted virtue one must perform 
the job immediately in hand, and sec only as 
far as one's nose extends. The "practical" 



method seems to be to investigate not causes 
but effects, to mend the social vessel after the 
mischief has been done, then to continue with 
"the work in hand," utterly disregarding the 
possibility of another breakdown and democratic- 
ally unmindful of the fearful waste of human 
energy and the horrible degradation of human 
life. Epimetheus is the god of the "practical" 
man. Eschew the eternal and the universal, 
shun the vision of the whole and the far-away, 
and you will be eminently practical. But if a 
refusal to compromise with present evils, a long 
experience in the ways of communal living, a 
keen social sense that leads to all forms of free co- 
operation and voluntary organization, an impa- 
tience with political tinkering and half-measures, 
a blessed commonsense that seizes upon the essen- 
tial and the "radical" in all things, an inspired 
vision of the social state with all its interde- 
pendent parts, if these are the marks of a prac- 
tical people, then the Russians are practical, and 
civilized. And when they are permitted by their 
present national enemy and by oversolicitous 
friends to exercise in freedom the right to con- 
trol their own destinies, a right earned by a 
century of agonizing struggle, the Russians will 
reveal their soul in a glorified, shapely, and 
equitable state. Some years ago, Herder had 
the courage to state that the Slavs were destined 
to say the last word in the development of Euro- 
pean civilization. He is only one of many who 
have held the profound conviction that from 
Russia will come the final word of deliverance.

History as "Purposive Tendency 

THE SPIRITUAL INTERPRETATION OF HISTORY. The 
William B. Noble Lectures, 1916. By Shailer 
Mailu-us. (Harvard University Press; $1.50.) 

William James has said "when we look at 
what has actually come, the conditions must al- 
ways appear perfectly designed to ensure it. We 
can always say, therefore, in any conceivable 
world, of any conceivable character, that the 
whole cosmic machinery may have been designed 
to produce it." But to assume upon the b:iM 
of such a causal series that the universe is evolv- 
ing a purpose is to commit the fallacy of ascrib- 
ing to the whole what appears to be true of the 
part. This, however, is the method employed 
by Shailer Mathews in his "Spiritual Interpreta- 
tion of History." He believes that a survey of 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



201 



historical development indicates that history is a 
process in which man has advanced beyond a 
condition of subjection to geographic and 
economic forces. These have "given rise to cus- 
toms which in turn proceeded onward to free 
choice on the part of both individuals and groups 
and of rational action in the light of more per- 
sonal values." Consequently we may assume that 
this is true of history as a whole : that a spiritual 
force, an elan vital, has evolved out of and in 
opposition to natural and economic forces. Hu- 
man history is a rational process. 

Professor Mathews protests against four prev- 
alent interpretations of history. The first seeks 
merely to amass facts without reference "to their 
genetic relationship as tension points in a social 
process." The second is theological. "Its rep- 
resentatives see little in history except providen- 
tial and often miraculous guidance by God." 
More significant at present are the geographic 
and economic interpretations of history. The 
geographic interpretation ascribes all differences 
to physical circumstances and grants humanity 
"little more initiative than the flower that turns 
to the sun"; while the economic interpretation 
accounts for the rise of social institutions and 
morality as due to the limitations of nature, on 
the one hand, and as the resultants of social 
antagonism and adjustments, on the other. Each 
view is inadequate and too simple. It is a Pro- 
crustean bed to which its advocates strive to fit 
their facts. A "real" interpretation of history 
conceives of it as a genetic process and deals ex- 
clusively with facts as they are. It requires per- 
spective and a realization that man lives and 
develops in society. If we view history in this 
manner, we perceive that, although economic and 
geographic forces are important, human history 
finds its true significance "in neither the environ- 
ment nor the human race itself, but in the total 
situation of man-in-nature." It is a process in 
which social life becomes more "personal." This 
process manifests itself in three tendencies: "the 
tendency to substitute inner sanctions and inhibi- 
tions for outward authority based upon force 
either human or divine; to recognize the worth 
of the individual as personal rather than as 
merely economic; and to substitute through so- 
cial action, itself increasingly democratic, the giv- 
ing of justice for the insistence upon right." 

This is the argument of the first five lectures. 
Most readers will agree with Professor Mathews 



that religious, moral, and artistic ideals, racial 
aspirations, and so on have profoundly influenced 
the course of history. They will further agree 
with him that ideals are more than mere result- 
ants, that they are also creative factors which 
must be taken account of in any interpretation 
of history. So far Professor Mathews appears 
to have demonstrated the undisputed. But this 
is only preparatory. The sixth lecture reveals 
the purpose of the book. In the previous lectures 
"spiritual" signified the personal elements re- 
ferred to above. Here a spiritual interpretation 
of history involves a belief in a super-personal 
tendency immanent in history. We become 
entangled in a mystical explanation which con- 
siders "personal activities" to be forces or enti- 
ties struggling in behalf of a Rational Spirit or 
Tendency in history. Such an interpretation 
confuses rather than enlightens; for, after all, 
what is this type of interpretation but a dignified 
fetishism? That it gives rise to more problems 
than it solves is obvious from the fact that Pro- 
fessor Mathews's Rational Tendency is a hybrid 
between Tennyson's purpose which runs through 
the ages, and Spencer's impersonal Unknown, 
Bergson's elan vital, Hegel's Weltgeist, and 
Lotze's "purpose." The layman is merely con- 
fused by this metaphysical fog, while the theolog- 
ian finds it too illusive to damn as heresy. But 
the man who is seeking an escape from the mech- 
anistic conception of life and wishes to remain 
loyal to the scientific spirit of the time receives 
no genuine help from this doctrine. Why must 
he be restricted to the two alternatives mechan- 
ism or supernaturalism ? Is the service performed 
by ideals any less vital and necessary to man if 
they fail to present a certificate of supernatural 
origin ? 

The problem of evil is not permitted to em- 
barrass this World Spirit. It is safely hidden 
and receives no mention. Nothing is said of 
immortality except that it "is no longer a rhetor- 
ical sentiment but a phase of the world process." 
To be sure, it is requisite if history be a pur- 
posive tendency! We are assured that man is 
practically free of impersonal forces, although 
"the pressure of materialistic thought and inter- 
ests was never greater than today." And, fin- 
ally, we are exhorted to cast our lot with the 
spiritual forces, for they represent "no forlorn 
hope." God's is the winning side!

Poetry as Supernaturalism 

THE Pome YEAR FOR 1916. A Critical Anthol- 
ogy. By William Stanley Braithwaite. (Small, 
Maynard & Co.; $2.) 

The energy of Mr. Braithwaite is unflagging. 
Not content with bringing out annually the "An- 
thology of Magazine Verse," he has now entered 
upon another and even huger enterprise "A 
Critical Anthology," he calls it; and this, too, 
threatens to become a hardy perennial. In these 
four hundred pages, which for the greater part 
consist of his reviews in the "Boston Evening 
Transcript," slightly revised and cast into the 
form of al fresco conversations between Mr. 
Braithwaite and three others, Mr. Braithwaite 
purports to cover the entire field of English and 
American poetry for 1916. Some fifty odd poets 
are discussed here, a list long enough surely to 
have included certain poets whose omission 
seems singular enough to warrant a more spe- 
cific explanation than Mr. Braithwaite offers. 
Mr. Robert Frost and Mr. Wilfrid Wilson Gib- 
son come in for only incidental mention. Messrs. 
Wallace Stevens, T. S. Eliot, and Maxwell Bo- 
denheim (whose work has appeared in anthol- 
ogies) are not mentioned at all. With these 
exceptions, however, the list is complete enough 
to afford us a clear idea of Mr. Braithwaite's 
temper and method. 

Concerning his predilections, Mr. Braithwaite 
leaves us in no doubt whatever. At the very 
centre of his attitude toward poetry is the ex- 
press belief that poetry is a sort of supernatural- 
ism. "It is the sacerdotal wonder of life which 
poets feel," he remarks. "More certainly than 
other men, poets are conscious of pre-existence, 
in other worlds, and in this too." Elsewhere, one 
encounters also such expressions as "reverence 
for life," "quest for beauty," and "mystic illu- 
mination." This sort of thing, one must confess, 
is a little too easy. Is it not really a shrugging 
of the critic's burden from his own shoulders, 
onto the shoulders of God? This is no place, to 
be sure, for a quarrel over the importance or the 
reality of God; but it is perhaps not going too 
far to say that within the sphere of man's con- 
sciousness, no matter to what miraculous origin 
it be ascribed, all things are at least subject to 
man's observation and analysis. If in the pres- 
ence of a piece of poetry the critic is content 
merely with the exclamatory, he is not doing his 
work. Let him remember that he is dealing, at 
least in large measure, not with the supernatural 
but with the natural; and what is natural has 



natural (biological and psychological) causes. 
These it is the critic's duty to determine and to 
relate. 

It is easy to see, therefore, where, in his rela- 
tion to contemporary poetry, so fundamental a 
failure leads Mr. Braithwaite. With this some- 
what quaint notion of the holiness of poetry in 
his head, it is natural that he should be most 
tolerant toward that sort of poetry which itself, 
in somewhat the same manner, takes for granted 
the holiness of life. In his present book, there- 
fore, Mr. Braithwaite puts a clear emotional 
emphasis on work which is characteristically sen- 
timental. Lizette Woodworth Reese, Bliss Car- 
man, Amelia Josephine Burr, Olive Tilford 
Dargan, Louis V. Ledoux, Hermann Hagedorn, 
these are some of the poets about whom Mr. 
Braithwaite can talk with unrestrained enthusi- 
asm. They, and to a less extent Edwin Arling- 
ton Robinson, observe toward life, in varying 
degrees, an attitude of chaste, romantic awe ; 
and it is this attitude, particularly when it ap- 
proaches the sweetly ecstatic or appears to be 
barely concealing a sob, that most delights Mr. 
Braithwaite. Consequently, such other poets as 
Edgar Lee Masters, Orrick Johns, William Car- 
los Williams, and the unmentioned Carl Sand- 
burg, T. S. Eliot, Wallace Stevens, John Rodker. 
and other poets of the "Others" group who are 
in the main realists, implicitly critical or analyt- 
ical of life, or at the most neutrally recepti\e. 
are somewhat coolly entertained. Of Mr. Mas- 
ters Mr. Braithwaite remarks, characteristically, 
that he "de-affinitizes imagination of mysterv"; 
of the poets who contributed to "Others," that 
they do not deal with life "but with their own 
little conception of it," which, of course, is 
precisely what all poets do. To Bliss Carman. 
on the other hand, he ascribes "magic," "natural 
svmbolisms with . . . supernatural meanings . . ." 
Clearly, such an attitude reveals in Mr. Braith- 
waite a very decided intellectual limitation. 
Must poetry be all marshmallows and tear-' I- 
it to be prohibited from dealing with ideas, or 
restricted solely to a contemplation of that small 
part of our lives which is, in a sentimental sense, 
beautiful? Is poetry to be merely a perfume re- 
served for our moments of languor? Mr. Braith- 
waite might not say "yes" to this question as it 
stands, but if it were put in a slightly different 
form, he would. And in consequence, try as he 
will, he cannot be entirely fair to our contem- 
porary empiricists. Even in his discussion of such 
poets as John Gould Fletcher and Miss Lowell, 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



203 



amiable and even adulatory as (oddly enough) 
it sometimes is, one detects a fundamental per- 
plexity and lack of understanding. 

The trouble with this book is, then, at bottom, 
that while it has a rather intriguing appearance 
of being judicial, it is really, under the mask, 
highly idiosyncratic. This might be redeemed 
if Mr. Braithwaite, in any part of his work, 
showed himself to be an interpreter possessed of 
subtlety or persuasiveness. Unfortunately that 
cannot be said. Mr. Braithwaite has, to begin 
with, a singular incapacity for perceiving the real 
meaning of words. He uses words in an orotund, 
meaningless way; words like "essence," "sub- 
stance," "mystery," "symbolism," are forever on 
his tongue. For this reason a great part of his 
book is thin reading; it is often impossible, ex- 
cept through the exercise of considerable imag- 
ination, to get any meaning out of it whatever. 
It is possible indeed that his inability to associate 
words precisely with the ideas for which they 
stand is the central secret of Mr. Braithwaite's 
failure as a critic: the cloudy inaccuracy of style 
may well be simply another aspect of an attitude 
of mind which has determined his predilection 
for vaguely interpretative rather than judicial 
criticism. It may equally account for the ex- 
traordinary lack of discrimination which leads 
him to discuss, not so many kinds of art (which 
would be merely catholic), but so many qualities 
of art, as if on one level of excellence. Brilliant, 
good, mediocre, and downright bad; subtle and 
commonplace; cerebral and sentimental, all are 
treated as of equal importance, and, apparently 
(as indicated by the last pair of contrasted 
terms), without any keen awareness of their dif- 
ference. When he is beyond his depth, Mr. 
Braithwaite simply takes refuge in words. "Every 
sense is evocative and intuitional," he says. 
"Mysticism and wonder are the vital nerves 
which connect the outer world of reality with 
the inner world of spirit. Does it matter how 
the substance is shaped, so long as it is given a 
being?" This is mere word-blowing; and Mr. 
Braithwaite's book is full of arguments equally 
ghostly. 

Shall we never learn that there is nothing 
mysterious or supernatural about poetry; that it 
is a natural, organic product, with discoverable 
functions, clearly open to analysis? It would be 
a pity if our critics and poets were to leave this 
to the scientists instead of doing it themselves.

"Potential India 



THE FOUNDATIONS OF INDIAN ECONOMICS. By 

Radhakamal Mukerjee. (Longmans, Green, & 

Co.; $3.) 

If we exclude her British suzerain, Americans 
are the most interested of Western nations in all 
that pertains to India. From the romantic days 
when swift Yankee clipper ships put the British 
out of competition for the Eastern trade, to the 
present war-time revival of Indian exports and 
larger imports, a consistent idealism has backed 
this interest: in Indian eyes America shed a dis- 
tant but kindly beneficence. American mission- 
aries have always outnumbered those of other 
Western nations, and they were the first to sub- 
stitute for a purely dogmatic religious platform 
the more effective educational wedge against 
heterogeneous India's caste-ridden masses. 

When famines visited those millions, recur- 
ring because of climatic and not administrative 
reasons, American largess promptly reached the 
field of suffering: during the epidemic of plague 
American missionaries, especially in the zenana, 
rendered valuable medical assistance. Nor has 
the acquisition of the Philippines changed or 
diverted this interest. That colonial adventure, 
with Kipling's clamant approval, merely identi- 
fied in the popular imagination both sides of the 
Atlantic, while an American vicereine at Simla 
later completed the sentimental rapprochement. 
Now that the Jones Bill has given the Philippines 
a political consciousness, the American experiment 
is the most practical example that has so far 
appeared for British assurance in their solution 
of India's immeasurably more complex problem. 

But it has remained for the epochal world-war 
to throw into flux all the facile cliches dispensed 
by Kipling about the isolation of East from 
West : they were no more erroneous than those 
Kipling scornfully attributed to his peripatetic 
members of Parliament. But the superficial, ex- 
traneous differences have been dissipated by the 
economic interdependence that the war has called 
into existence. To-day America is importing 
from India far more than she ever did, more 
than she exports, even though these exports have 
increased because of the dislocation of European 
sources and channels. The future of this trade 
is assured, and its greatest benefit will be the 
reciprocal influences of the new social and polit- 
ical contact between East and West. The Orient 
was once a fruitful field of paradox and incon- 
gruity, whence the proteges of Cook drew abun- 
dant material for social impressions and 



204 



THE DIAL 



[September 13 



political generalizations. But the war has 
sown such incongruities and paradoxes liberally 
throughout Western civilizations, so that, iron- 
ically, West has become East in certain political 
and cultural aspects. 

Thus, in order to readjust our knowledge of 
the Orient, books like Professor Mukerjee's are 
extremely valuable. That such books are com- 
ing from the pens of native scholars is the great- 
est compliment to the British educational system, 
even though that system is still hampered by the 
theoretical dogma of Macaulay's rhetoric. War- 
ren Hastings has been released from Macaulay's 
inaccurate, overdrawn picture, but the so-called 
literati of the Babu class are still being produced 
under the stupid minutes he once framed for 
Indian education. But Indian scholars are turn- 
ing their knowledge of rural and local conditions 
into useful surveys of the potentialities of India 
and her peoples. Hitherto they were academic- 
ally engrossed with her great past. Professor 
Mukerjee is typical of the new school of Indian 
thinkers. He has sifted carefully the phenomena 
of change and decay in Indian institutions, reg- 
istered the perils arising from the conflict be- 
tween an ancient agrarian population and the 
disintegrating Western industrialism; he makes 
an eloquent plea for those phases of an indigenous 
Indian economy upon which the life and soul of 
his people depends. The evils of overproduc- 
tion, wholesale extinction of hereditary arts and 
crafts, the exploitation of mill towns, are data 
familiar enough in the West, but they are freshly 
epidemic in the new Orient. It is encouraging 
to know that 

The Indian factory hand is primarily an agri- 
culturalist. His real home is in his native village, 
not in the city where he works. He leaves both wife 
and children behind him when he emigrates to the 
factory', and regularly returns to them to look after 
his family affairs and to rest from his labors. More 
than this, he can always find work in his village if 
he gets tired of the factory. 

So much for the family's being, as in China, an 
effective economic unit. But I cannot agree with 
the author in anticipating the continuance of 
caste on the grounds of a similar argument. It 
is true that caste has a societal cohesiveness, with 
all the fluid communalism he extols, but his 
statement regarding the flexibility of caste, of a 
sort of emancipation of the lower and depressed 
classes by virtue of adopting and practising a 
forbidden trade, is not true of the entire country. 
His observations are frequently limited to his 
native Bengal. But he has been at pains to pre- 
sent every trade and village industry of the 



country, and his illustrations are valuable. The 
only defect in his book is the absence of a nl<> 
for native names and expressions, especially since 
he quotes both the Hindi and the Urdu variants. 
There is no space to take up such fascinating 
subjects as the promise of the new rural credit 
and cooperative systems for India's future; a ro- 
mance flickers about the native banking system, 
about the picturesque arts and crafts, and the 
guild system which, certain writers predict, will 
be revived among the smaller nationalities re- 
habilitated in Europe by the war and its after- 
math. Professor Mukerjee warns against a blind 
adoption of Western industrial methods. His 
belief that India's economic structure has hitherto 
developed in keeping with her indigenous needs, 
and that it must so continue, will meet with ap- 
proval. Japan, as the pioneer, is now giving her 
Eastern imitators a lesson in the way she is pain- 
fully recapitulating Western industrial and 
economic problems as a result of overproduction 
and meretricious "booming": to her discredit she 
is dumping in India and China shoddy merchan- 
dise which must inevitably react in favor of 
America, her formidable competitor for the East- 
ern markets. With Professor Mukerjee's 
intensive survey of India's potentialities, it is not 
Utopian to hope that India's economic contact 
with America and Europe will more and more 
reflect the genius of her fascinating races and 
their rich, manifold activities. One can only 
wish that the traditional panchdyat, or village 
council, had continued to exercise under the 
British aegis all its old administrative functions, 
instead of degenerating into a caste or trade 
guild. I believe that a resuscitation of the 
panchayat will justify its continuance, urged in 
1818 by an able administrator like Elphinstone, 
as a training-school for the autonomous govern- 
ment pledged to India by the British. Through 
this traditional vehicle of government India will 
come to full political stature, ready for eventual 
self-government; but it would be futile, as the 
British already realize, to give her autonomy in 
her present incohesive, inarticulate condition. 
This, however, was not Professor Mukerjee's 
theme. But none who knows her intimately will 
wish her any other future than one that is based 
upon such precious data from her historic past 
as are here evaluated by an Indian scholar, and 
as one who knows her personally I can wish her 
no better political future than is assured by her 
fair-minded if unimaginative British sponsor.

The Problem of the Immigrant 

THE IMMIGRANT AND THE COMMUNITY. By 
Grace Abbott. (Century Co.; $1.50.) 

Now that the long-debated question of im- 
migration exclusion is at least in a measure dis- 
posed of through legislation, the public mind 
may possibly find itself willing to turn toward 
a more sympathetic study of the immigrant. His- 
torically there has been so much feeling and so 
little calm consideration of the whole question 
of immigration that to most people there has 
seemed to be but one really significant problem: 
whether we should continue to admit to our 
doubtful hospitality such great masses of un- 
familiar peoples with different customs and 
habits and lower standards of living than our 
own. Miss Abbott reminds us that we have in 
reality a much more pressing problem than this 
to deal with. How shall we learn to be neigh- 
borly with our immigrants at home? How can 
we substitute justice for exploitation, sympathy 
for suspicion, and appreciation for derision and 
even hate? 

In Miss Abbott these more neighborly atti- 
tudes were established long ago. As director of 
the Immigrants' Protective League of Chicago, 
and as a resident of Hull House for many years, 
she has developed that intimate touch with the 
problems, the hopes, the disappointments, and the 
ways of thinking of the newcomers which ren- 
ders her perhaps as well fitted as anyone not an 
immigrant to interpret the people in her charge 
to the rest of the world. She is so sympathetic 
that some might call her partisan. Perhaps she 
is ; but certainly her partisanship is in the nature 
of a great moral protest against inexcusable evils 
of intolerance, race-prejudice, and economic and 
political exploitation. We need more such cry- 
ing out against this smugness of ours where other 
souls and bodies are at stake ; against our drift 
into a comfortable and complacent attitude of 
mind. 

Miss Abbott's plea is for adjustment rather 
than assimilation. In this respect she disagrees 
with the textbook writers, and perhaps with most 
staunch Americans. She believes that the immi- 
grant brings a contribution to America which 
should be preserved; that he is not merely a 
seeker after our treasures when they exist out- 
side the European peasant's imagination. This 
contribution of hope and industry, of strength 
and purpose, of faith and power, which is so 
characteristic of the simple folk, she would un- 
cover and train into full flower for usefulness. 



Now we are accustomed to suppress it, to per- 
vert it, to turn its sweetness into bitterness be- 
cause of the hard face we turn and the relentless 
exploitation of the immigrant body which our cal- 
lous economic method demands. Often our un- 
regulated social institutions prove a snare rather 
than an aid to the unsophisticated immigrant, 
thus destroying his frugality and his sobriety. 

The troubles of the immigrant begin with the 
first touch of foot to our shores. The complex- 
ity of our street life and of our traffic weighs 
upon his simple rural mind. The extortions of 
the expressman and the small tradesman, the 
snare which the procurer sets for the helpless and 
friendless immigrant girl untrained in our lan- 
guage, the hard struggle for a job, often much 
more difficult than was expected or represented, 
the ever-present extortion of the labor agency, 
and the greed and bad faith of the contractor 
these are phases of our welcome to the immigrant 
almost as frequent as they are unexpected. Nor 
do we always improve upon a closer acquaint- 
ance. If our new neighbor prospers in a small 
way and wishes to send money home to depend- 
ent relatives or to aid some member of his family 
in joining him, the immigrant bank, which our 
political system permits to exist without due 
supervision and control, may defraud him of his 
savings. If he enters the courts, he is almost 
certain to find a prejudice against him there, 
which, if it does not pervert justice, may at least 
deny it because of lack of sufficient interest in 
the suppliant on the part of the court. Dis- 
honest lawyers and notaries make him their easy 
prey because of his unfamiliarity with our lan- 
guage and with the tricks of our laissez-faire 
social, political, and economic systems. In other 
ways, if somewhat less tangibly, the immigrant 
suffers from our neglect. In the matter of public 
health and morals he does not so much create new 
problems as complicate old ones. His lack of 
urban habits of mind and body makes it all the 
more necessary to hedge him about with safe- 
guards and leadership. The immigrant woman 
especially is the victim of the incompetence of 
the midwife, who in America lacks training and 
supervision. 

In the matter of education we have been lax 
and non-understanding with the immigrant. We 
have not sufficiently realized that his peculiar 
problems of economic and political adjustment 
call for more vocational and citizenship training 
than our but half-consciously organized schools 
are accustomed to give. Indeed, it might be 
much better for the native youth if they had 



206 



THE DIAL 



[September 1.? 



more of this sort of training in place of the 
highly traditionalized curriculum to which they 
are so often subjected. Frequently the immi- 
grant comes to us with good native attitudes but 
with a lack of experience in political affairs. Too 
often his first insight into our public callousness, 
the lack of democracy and efficiency in our re- 
puted democracy, saddens and disgusts him. 
Here we lose a good citizen. We need more 
sympathetic leadership and organization of immi- 
grant life on its public-interests and contacts side. 
One of the most interesting of Miss Abbott's 
many pertinent suggestions regarding immigrant 
adjustment is that we organize more carefully 
the potentialities for the development of an in- 
ternational understanding through immigration 
into this country and return migration.

Emotionalism and ff^ar 



LETTERS AND DIARY OF ALAK SEEGER. (Charles 
Scribncr's Sons; $1.25.) 

Enough has possibly been said about the gen- 
eral disappointment in Alan Seeger's "Letters 
and Diary"; practically every critic who has 
reviewed the book has said something to that 
effect. As is the way with critics, however, they 
have all said the same thing: Seeger's letters and 
diary are disappointing because they are not what 
was expected from a young, romantic poet. They 
prove with disconcerting flatness the truism that 
no poet is a poet all the time; they even prove 
that some poets are less than poets most of the 
time. Seeger's letters and diary (if one excepts 
the letters written consciously for publication 
and therefore with more attention to con- 
tent and style) consist for the most part of the 
commonplace details of soldier life, repeated 
many times without personal or enlivening com- 
ment and with only too few descriptions of com- 
panions or scenery. The greater portion of the 
book, including even the letters to the newspa- 
pers, is ordinary, quite like the many books 
from the hands of mere journalists. 

There is another, smaller, but far more im- 
portant part of the volume that is also disap- 
pointing, and in inverse ratio to its size; it is 
the part, or parts, where the poet does write 
and where, therefore, his philosophy of life ap- 
pears. Alan Seeger was narrow-minded. It 
might be said, paradoxically, that he was nar- 
row-minded in a broad way, for he happened 
to be warped on the side of those issues in life 



which are popularly called "big" and "great." 
But to be convinced that he was incapable of 
genuine sympathy with many alien points of 
view one needs only to read the letters. In 
the poems this attitude had been discovered, the 
letters probably only emphasize it. In Sonnet 
XI, "On Returning to the Front After Leave," 
he says: 

. . . we turn disdainful backs 
On that poor world we scorn yet die to shield 
That world of cowards, hypocrites and fools. 

It is not ungenerous to find that disappointing. 
The tone of the letters is not quite so harsh ; 
the demands of rhyme and metre may take their 
share of the blame, but the attitude is the same 
and it is consistently held. "I pity the poor 
civilians" sums up his feeling toward those who, 
for no matter what reason, were not directly 
concerned with the war. 

But as in times of peace there is nothing better 
then love and art, so in times of war there is noth- 
ing better than fighting and one must make the best 
of it, finding recompense in feeling one's heart pulse 
in concert with those of the eMite who are doing the 
inost admirable thing, rather than with those of the 
multitude who are concerned with second-best 
things. . . Great as are the pleasures that [the 
poor civilians] are continuing to enjoy and that we 
have renounced, the sense of being the instrument 
of Destiny is to me a source of greater satisfaction. 
. . . Killed, more than any other man, [the sol- 
dier] can face the unknown without misgiving. . . 

If Alan Seeger had meant that some of us 
are forced to be content with second-best things, 
that would have been sympathetic and his poetry 
and letters would be more satisfying to the poor 
civilian. But we are "concerned with second- 
best things," and a reading of the letters shows 
that we are so from pure mediocrity. The sense 
of "being the instrument of Destiny" comes to 
many a man, and many more women, who will 
never see a trench, and why the soldier faces 
the unknown with any less misgiving than other 
men is not clear. It is undoubtedly a glorious 
thing to be a soldier, especially so truly and 
thoroughly a soldier as was Seeger. He is fas- 
cinating and admirable perhaps more for that 
reason than because he was a poet. And while 
to criticize him for having his point of view 
would be only to borrow his own narrow-mind- 
edness, it is perfectly permissible to criticize him 
for his inability to see that the world is full of 
other views, no less noble and commendable. 
Seeger's is' so largely a mere expression of his 
emotions that annoyance becomes the dominant 
reaction as one reads. He was tired of ordinary 
existence, that existence which demands the best

powers of mind and soul. Victor Chapman, in 
his "Letters from France," says: "Remember 
Alan Seeger was an appalling wreck before the 
war." No matter what this means, it throws a 
helpful light on one's reading of the letters. He 
seems to have been satiated, for he calls "a dia- 
bolical cry, a blood-curdling yell of mockery and 
exultation" which came from the hillside of 
the Boches one night, an "antidote to civilization 
of which this war can offer so many to the 
searcher after extraordinary sensations." Search- 
ing for extraordinary sensations echoes discour- 
agingly of Oscar Wilde and his group; it is 
certainly not the sort of thing that helps the 
civilian to live his life more worthily. 

Seeger does speak now and then in tones which 
remind the reader of the youth who wrote "I 
Have a Rendezvous with Death." There are 
even paragraphs sufficiently penetrating to bal- 
ance his superficial emotionalism: 

There is a common bourgeois notion which, asso- 
ciated with the common bourgeois ideal of a man 
finally making enough money to be able to retire 
and live on his income, pictures the happy life as a 
kind of steady progression through a series of ups 
and downs toward a kind of plateau, the summit 
of which once attained, he can thereafter march 
along tranquilly on a level of unbroken and in- 
destructible well-being. It is perfectly clear that 
such a notion is entirely illusory, in the multiple 
accidents to which life is susceptible, for even sup- 
posing that he has attained such a level by the realiza- 
tion of every other earthly ambition, he is always 
walking on the unstable brink of the love that he 
has created for himself and upon which he is de- 
pendent, the crumbling of which beneath his feet 
by death or abandonment would immediately plunge 
him into the blackest abysses, where everything else 
that he had realized would mean nothing. As for 
myself, I look upon life as a series of ups and downs, 
right up (or down) to the very end. The idea of 
being any higher at the end than at the beginning 
was never part of my reveries. I never conceived 
the advent of a moment when turbulence and strife 
could be thought of as put definitely behind one. 
But I clung passionately to, and drank deep of, such 
moments of happiness as circumstances set before me 
the importance to me was the moment that joy 
rescued from oblivion and for me the measure of a 
happy life was simply the proportion in which the 
sum-total of these moments of happiness, scattered 
indiscriminately through it, outbalanced the sum-total 
of the unhappy ones. 

And that is wisdom, the very sort that will help 
the poor civilian with his ups and downs. That 
Alan Seeger wrote so little of it may have been 
due to the external circumstances of a life at best 
none too conducive to thoughtfulness, but the 
unfortunate fact remains that his letters and 
diary show few such oases.

Lucid Mystics 



THE OXFORD BOOK OF ENGLISH MYSTICAL VERSE. 
Chosen by D. H. S. Nicholson and A. H. E. Lee. 
(Oxford University Press; $2.) 

The slowly growing series of the Oxford 
Books of Verse has from its inception been one 
of the necessaries of life to every lover of poetry. 
With the single exception of Palgrave's "Golden 
Treasury" no other anthologies of such uni- 
formly high merit have been published. (In 
passing, let us express a fervent wish that the 
Delegates of the Clarendon Press may issue an 
"Oxford Book of American Verse" in recogni- 
tion of our alliance with England.) 

"The Oxford Book of English Mystical 
Verse" maintains the standards set by its pre- 
decessors, but the reviewer of it faces one pecu- 
liar difficulty that of definition. What is 
mystical verse? None but a German Doctor 
of Philosophy would dare attempt sharply to de- 
fine it, especially when the editors of the collec- 
tion frankly shirk the task. They say: 

Our conception of mysticism must be found in the 
poetry we have gathered together. But it may serve 
as a ground for comprehension to say that in mak- 
ing our selection we have been governed by a desire 
to include only such poems and extracts from poems 
as contain intimations of a consciousness wider 
and deeper than the normal. This is the connecting 
link between them the thread, as it were, on which 
the individual pieces are strung. It is less a ques- 
tion of a common subject than of a common stand- 
point and in some sense a common atmosphere, and 
our attempt has been to steer a middle course between 
the twin dangers of an uninspired piety on the one 
hand and mere intellectual speculation on the 
other. . . 

When we abandon the hopeless effort at defini- 
tion and turn to the contents of the book, we 
find selections from more than one hundred and 
fifty poets, ranging in date from Richard Rolle 
of Hampole to John Masefield and Alfred Noyes 
and in religion from Francis Thompson to Sar- 
ojini Nayadu and Edward Carpenter. The dis- 
tribution of the poems in point of time is 
interesting. Five-sixths of them more than 
five-sixths, if we count Blake among the nine- 
teenth century poets are the product of that 
nineteenth century which its own prophets de- 
nounced as materialistic and skeptical beyond all 
previous epochs, of this twentieth century which, 
we were told before the war, was wholly given 
over to fads and superficiality. Of the poems 
from earlier centuries which have been deemed 
worthy of a place in this collection, far more 
than half are the work of five men Donne, 
Herbert, Crashaw, Vaughan, and Traherne. 
Contemplation of these facts awakens a dreadful 



206

[September 13 



qualm of doubt. Is it possible that we have over- 
looked some vital elements in our glib catalogu- 
ing of nineteenth century tendencies; that even 
Early Victorian England is still too near at hand 
for its whole significance to be evident? 

Sins of omission are the usual refuge of the 
reviewer of an anthology. Because the major- 
ity of the poems included are the work of men 
of established fame his fault-finding propensities 
are curbed; he lacks the courage to attack that 
which public opinion has pronounced good, and 
therefore pitches into the editors for omitting 
work which he himself has approved of. Such 
procedure would be especially easy in dealing 
with anything so indefinable as mystical verse 
in fact, it is too easy to be worth doing. For 
the sake, however, of keeping up a useful tradi- 
tion, we may express a slight surprise that no 
place has been found for Whittier among the 
American poets included. Emerson and Whit- 
man are generously represented, and there are 
characteristic poems by Madison Cawein, Bliss 
Carman, Father Tabb, and others. Among the 
work of living Englishmen we could wish that 
room had been made for Kipling's strange 
"Prayer of Miriam Cohen" and for more of 
G. K. Chesterton's work. His "Holy of 
Holies" is given, but we miss "The Beatific Vi- 
sion" and other poems in which the most robust 
and controversial of modern mystics declares his 
faith. 

The thought of Chesterton awakens us to a 
realization of the most remarkable feature of 
most of the poems in this collection their clar- 
ity. Their mystical quality is due to elevation of 
thought, not to woolly-mindedness. Some poets 
are vague and mysterious simply because they 
cannot or will not think clearly, but most of the 
writers here represented are as lucid and uncon- 
fused as St. Paul himself. Only rarely notably 
in Aleister Crowley's "The Quest," every stanza 
of which requires at least one footnote to explain 
its symbolic meaning do we feel that the poet 
is overdoing the thing. The true mystic can 
make his vision plain without footnotes. 

For the present reviewer the reading of this 
volume has had at least one permanent result. 
A vague impression as to the identity of the two 
greatest lyrics other than elegies in the Eng- 
lish language has been changed to a certainty. 
Every poem in this collection is thoughtful and 
sincere, many are in the highest sense inspired, 
but the two which tower above every rival as 



Shakespeare towers above all other English dram- 
atics are the "Ode on the Intimations of Im- 
mortality" and "The Hound of Heaven." After 
rereading them in direct comparison with all 
the best English verse of a similar nature, we 
lay the book aside with the conviction not only 
that they represent the highest flight of sustained 
lyric inspiration in nineteenth century poetry 
but that they are the most perfect religious poems 
in the whole range of our literature.

Another Irish Dramatist 

FIVE PLAYS. By George Fitzmaurice. (Little, 
Brown & Co.; $1.25.) 

It is quite the fashion to cast slurs at the later 
Irish dramatists. I hold no brief for the manu- 
facturers of folk-melodrama after the school of 
Lennox Robinson; but it seems to me mean- 
spirited to ignore the peculiar handicaps under 
which contemporary Irish playwrights work, and 
unjust to close our eyes to any possible merits 
in their plays. 

William Boyle and Lady Gregory, Padraic 
Colum, Yeats, and Synge have left a perilous 
legacy. Their successors must be very able to 
carry forward even their ordinary efforts. More- 
over, a change has come over Irish drama. Since 
1908 the Abbey Theatre, its very heart, has of 
necessity been commercialized. It has become a 
huckster trading in any catchy Irish play, writ- 
ten in any Irish dialect, by any dramatist with 
a good Irish name. Real Irish dramatists are 
peculiarly at the mercy of the Irish theatre, for 
the best folk-drama withers and loses its savor 
transplanted to a strange stage. 

I am not framing an apology for the plays 
of George Fitzmaurice, for they need none; 
but to judge fairly any dramatist, especially a 
real Irish dramatist, we must remember his 
dramatic traditions and the stage and public for 
which he writes. 

Mr. Fitzmaurice is a connecting link between 
the earlier and the later writers of the Irish 
dramatic movement. In his technique, he is a 
contemporary Irish dramatist ; in his simpler point 
if view and freer imagination, he is a true son 
of the pioneers. His vivid dialogue and char- 
acter-drawing surpass most contemporary work. 
For sheer beauty, either of thought or expres- 
M'OII. he does not equal his predecessors. As a 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



realist, he writes in the modern vein; as a fan- 
tast, in the spirit of the earlier men. 

His realistic plays have simple plots. "The 
Country Dressmaker" is the story of Julia Shea, 
who for ten years has kept a romantic troth with 
Pats Connor, her girlhood lover who emigrated 
to America. Pats, having long since forgotten 
Julia, returns to Ireland and, upon hearing the 
story of her faith, resolves to live up to her ideal. 
Even the complications to this simple plot, fur- 
nished by the schemes of an influential neighbor 
who angles for Pats's American-made fortune 
with his two daughters, are quite obvious, and 
their obviousness is accentuated by the fact that 
the two Clohesy girls and their parents are cari- 
catures rather than characters. This fault mars 
other plays. Mr. Fitzmaurice is given to sketch- 
ing his lesser people in a few bold strokes with- 
out enough background to furnish us with true 
portraits. When he does take pains, however, 
he can draw a splendidly rounded character. It 
is the careful character-studies of Eugene Guerin, 
his parents, and his uncle, Malachi Cantillon, 
that save his other long play, "The Moonlight- 
er," from being merely an agrarian melodrama 
of the type made familiar by Ray, Murray, 
Casey, and the rest. In this play, too, are some 
of the most delicious bits of dialect, a feature of 
Mr. Fitzmaurice's work that Irish critics have 
praised, not for its faithfulness in detail, but 
for its true, vivid spirit. An American can ap- 
preciate this criticism when he reads the "Yankee- 
isms" employed by Pats Connor. His "I reckon 
I can corroborate Mr. Quilter's remarks" is not 
a speech of Mister Dooley, but to a Dublin 
audience it would sound more typically Irish- 
American. 

It is in his three short plays that Mr. Fitz- 
maurice is at his best. "The Pie-Dish" is a 
convincing study of struggle for artistic expres- 
sion, cast in a realistic and startlingly unusual 
mold. Old Leum Donoghue, a peasant, has 
worked for twenty years modelling a pie dish. 
When his masterpiece is nearly done, he is 
stricken. His family call the priest, but the artist 
thrusts the priest aside to finish his work. He 
feels death near and in agony prays to God for 
time. Heaven failing him, he calls on the Devil 
and drops dead, his precious pie dish slipping 
from his hands to break on the floor. 

Mr. Fitzmaurice's two highly imaginative 
plays, "The Magic Glasses" and "The Dandy 



Dolls," are strangely akin to the realistic "Pie- 
Dish." The efforts of Jaymony Shanahan's fam- 
ily to save him from the spell of the magic spec- 
tacles with which he retires to the loft to see 
glorious visions are reminiscent of the efforts of 
old Leum's daughters to save him from damna- 
tion; and his prosaic pie dish, which Death will 
not let him finish, is a forerunner of the be- 
witched dolls of Roger Carmody, whose wind- 
pipes, as soon as he finishes making them, are 
always stolen away by the Hag's Son. These 
last two plays are pure fantasies, dealing with 
wierd, supernatural forces, not lightly or tim- 
idly, but firmly and boldly. As a result they 
have a dramatic intensity that more delicate, sug- 
gestive fantasies Yeats's "The Land of Heart's 
Desire," for example lack. They prove their 
author to be a master-dramatist of Celtic phan- 
tasmagoria. 

These "Five Plays" justify the hope that, if 
only the Abbey Theatre will cease trying to be 
a Hibernian branch of Drury Lane, it can still 
produce real Irish dramatists.

The Classical Stage of Japan 

"NoH," OR ACCOMPLISHMENT: A STUDY OF THE 
CLASSICAL STAGE OF JAPAN. By Ernest Fenollosa 
and Ezra Pound. (Alfred A. Knopf; $2.75.) 

To-day's reciprocal obligations in regard to 
culture continue to multiply. This is one of the 
pleasure-pains of cosmopolitanism. Mr. Fenol- 
losa's records of his conversations with the re- 
viver of the classical drama of Japan tell how 
he gave the ancient man a brief account of the 
classic drama of Greece: "he already knew," 
adds this Occidental adventurer into the lore of 
the East, "something about opera." Now, if the 
Oriental shows a disposition to familiarize him- 
self with Euripides and Puccini to say nothing 
of Nietzsche, Tolstoy, Victor Hugo, and Oscar 
Wilde shall we not exert ourselves in turn, 
and show a willingness to go beyond Hokusai 
and Hiroshige? 

The "Noh" drama, as shaped in the fifteenth 
century and saved through Japan's transition to 
the new day, is the complete negation of all 
literalism and of the merely mimetic. It scorns 
both. It relates to the well-known school of 
the Danjuros about as the classical school of 
Chinese painting relates to the color-prints of

Ukiyo-ye. It is noble, not plebeian; spiritistic, 
not realistic: it squares with the fundamental 
principles of all good art, rather than with the 
thoughtless passing fashion of any particular day. 
Fenollosa, on his death, left a large body of 
notes and translations concerned with this school 
of drama. Most of his material was got, first 
hand, from Umewaka Minoru, descendant of a 
long line of esteemed actors, who made it the 
work of his later years to rescue the ancient and 
honorable traditions of the classic stage from the 
shock which, in 1868, inaugurated the era of 
Meiji. This mass of material passed into the 
hands of Mr. Pound, whose treatment of it is 
briefly explained in his "Note." Says he: "The 
vision and the plan are Fenollosa's. In the prose 
I had had but the part of literary executor; in 
the plays my work has been that of translator 
who has found all the heavy work done for him 
and who has had but the pleasure of arranging 
beauty into the words." Gather his method from 
a passage in one of the fifteen short pieces which 
the book presents, that called "Nishikigi" (The 
Love-Charm Wands). Here is Fenollosa's 
prose : 

It is strange, seeing these town-people here. I 
might suppose them two married people; and what 
the lady gives herself the trouble of carrying might 
be a piece of cloth woven from birds' feathers, and 
what the man has is a sword, painted red. It is 
indeed queer merchandise. 

Here is Pound's verse: 

Strange indeed, seeing these town-people here, 

They seem like man and wife, 

And the lady seems to be holding something 

Like a cloth woven of feathers, 

While he has a staff or a wooden sceptre 

Beautifully ornate. 

Both of these things are strange; 

In any case, I wonder what they call them. 

This play, "Nishikigi," though (like most of 
the others) largely spiritistic, should easily be 
intelligible to the Western mind: it has a "love 
interest" which ought to help us take hold and 
feel at home. A "wandering priest, a standard 
character in "Noh," meets two ghosts in ancient 
attire in a remote village. They tell their story. 
The man, for three years, had offered charm- 
sticks, those "crimson tokens of love," night after 
night, and finally died of despair. The woman, 
oblivious or ignorant, or from mere coquetry, 
had sat at her weaving within her house. The 
man was buried in a cave, with all his wands. 
The woman repented of her cruelty if such it 
was and died also. The two have been dead 
for a century, and have not yet been united. The 



priest visits the cave. But the night is too cold 
for sleep, and he enters upon a ritual before the 
cave's mouth. His warm respect for the old 
tale begins to produce its effect. The lovers come 
to life within the illuminated cavern, a kindly 
chorus cooperates with the priest, and the lovers 
finally accomplish a spirit union before the final 
moment which prophesies a void waste "a wild 
place, unlit, and unfilled." 

Considering the "Noh" in its essence, the 
ancient and loyal Japanese historian should have 
had little difficulty with the Greek drama, what- 
ever headway he may or may not have made with 
the opera. For the two stages, the two schools, 
have much in common. Each had an independent 
growth from miracle playsone from the plays 
of the worship of Bacchus, the other from the 
plays of the worship of Buddha and of the Shinto 
deities ; each prefers to deal with a tale or legend 
already well known ; each accomplishes a wide 
generalization that rises gravely and scornfully 
above the petty mimetics and realisms of the 
day; each employs a chorus; each involves danc- 
ing, and each practices a play-sequence, the 
Greeks, one of four parts and the Japanese, one 
of six, which last presents, as Mr. Pound 
phrases it, "a complete service of life." The 
mere dialogue is but one feature among several; 
the singing and the dancing must always be con- 
sidered if one is to reach a clear understanding 
and a complete aesthetic appreciation. 

The order, as shown by Fenollosa's notes, is 
this: a congratulatory piece, or ceremonial 
address to the gods; a battle-piece, with due mind- 
fulness for the emperors; a "wig-piece" for 
females; a spirit-piece, since the spirits form the 
vague but lasting background of man's transi- 
tory and tristful experiences; a moral piece, 
inculcating the various virtues; lastly, another 
congratulatory piece, to call down blessings on 
the lords present, on the actors themselves, and 
on the scene of their endeavors. Thus the cycle 
is closed. 

Mr. Pound, in his notes and comments, writes 
with his usual unceremonious directness: if he is 
sometimes rugged, blunt, and downright, one at 
least gets a strong sense of primary impact from 
a man who is duly, even vastly, concerned. And 
as the volume is made by the Clarks, of Edin- 
burgh, a "serious" house, one notes, with grati- 
fication, an almost complete suppression of Mr. 
Pound's tendency toward typographical wilful- 
nesses and eccentricities.

Primitive Emotion 



HELEN OF FOUR GATES. By An Ex-Mill-Girl 
(E. P. Button & Co.; $1.50.) 

The attempt to express primitive emotion in- 
tensified and made vivid by circumstance is al- 
most the severest test that an author can undergo. 
He must either succeed or he must fail abjectly. 
And if he has the power to succeed, his novel may 
fail of a hundred estimable qualities; it at least 
has truth. Of course the supreme example of 
this expression is "Tess," and only in less degree 
Hardy's other works, "The Woodlanders" in 
particular. That works of such epic sweep 
should come irresistibly to one's mind throughout 
the reading of this novel by an unknown author 
is a sufficient proof of its power. 

"Helen of Four Gates" is set in the aged 
moors of the Druid country, in north Lancashire 
one imagines, where among the respectable little 
lives of the villagers it seems more possible than 
elsewhere for some spirit to gleam out who has 
absorbed in her veins all the passionate heritage 
of the land, which turns life so easily and so in- 
evitably into tragedy. For "she were made to 
live an' love, an' give an' take, more'n most, as 
if to make her suffer more." That was Helen. 
"My father didn't bring me up like a turtle- 
dove," she herself said. "An' I'd no saints wi' 
leets round their heads, an' faces like they'd no 
blood ... I'm made the other way, somehow 
allus th' other way runnin' after what should 
run after me, runnin' awa' fro' what I should 
run to." 

In short, it is pure, undisciplined nature that 
the author represents in a threefold struggle ; 
first, against the respectability and pride grafted 
upon her own nature by its contact with Four 
Gates; secondly, against the hatred and cruelty 
personified in the man she had been told to call 
her father; thirdly, against the cold human rea- 
son of the man who loved her and whose fear 
of inherited madness in her was a stronger thing 
than his love. It is something more than a merely 
human struggle that the author has represented, 
consciously or not. It is the eternal struggle of 
all elemental, living things to maintain their 
birthright to freedom of expression in living 
terms. This is the truth that the "Ex-Mill- 
Girl" makes you feel. She has run a certain 
amount of danger in making you feel it, but a 
danger that you leave unrealized in the reading. 
The fact stands that we take her Helen as she 
is revealed to us. 



There are other fine things about the novel 
besides its truth, but I think that they are subor- 
dinate to it, probably derived from it. The author 
has built her book, you feel, out of her own emo- 
tion, perfectly controlled. She herself must have 
experienced to an unusual degree the sense of a 
common heritage with all sentient and growing 
things. She gives you with a deep, intuitive 
understanding the life of the countryside in its 
moods of blustering, desolate darkness when 
"night with a laugh of anarchy blotted out the 
symbols of law and order, gave infinity for acres, 
reclaimed for a short time the wild that was half 
tame, and lent a sense that here fierce dark deeds 
had been done, and might be done again"; or 
when it turns its face to morning and to laugh- 
ter in the dawn of another day "in a world that 
knows nothing but the present" ; or in the envel- 
oping mantle of still snow when everything hu- 
man that is not outcast turns to glowing fires 
in the well-swept kitchens, to baking things and 
drowsiness. All human desires and actions are 
pointed and often in reality swayed by these 
throbbing and cruelly unconscious changes upon 
the face of things. They were so much a part 
of Helen that to have transplanted her from her 
hills would have been like uprooting the heather 
and the furze. 

The denouement, however, is distinctly disap- 
pointing, below the level of the rest. The author 
has prepared us through her pictures of old Ma- 
son's cruelty to his "daughter," through the har- 
rowing months when the prospect of Martin's 
desertion is growing into a dread certainty, 
through her year of marriage to Mason's willing 
tool, for a tragedy that seems as inevitable and 
as complete as one of Hardy's. The book would 
have ended better with Helen and Martin wait- 
ing on the hillside in the dawn for their doom 
than with all the fortuitous accidents, deaths, 
and recoveries that give it its unearned happy 
ending. Such an ending, constitutes, indeed, a 
heavy drain upon the resources of the gods of 
chance. One hopes it was not a concession to 
the gods of credulity that rule our modern mar- 
ket. For the qualities I liked best in this story 
were qualities that are not modern that make 
a story, whether it is a year or a hundred years 
old, live in our memories for its truth and its 
humor and its imagination, that give it poignancy 
and distinction.

BKIF.FS ON XEW BOOKS 



WHY ITALY ENTERED INTO THE GREAT 
WAR. By Luigi Carnovale. Italian-Amer- 
ican Publishing Co. ; $2.50. 
A work of marked value for the study of one 
phase of the present world-conflict is Luigi Car- 
novale's bi-lingual volume, "Why Italy Entered 
into the Great War," or, in its other form, 
"Perche 1'Italia e Entrata Nella Grande Guerra." 
The author's concern is with the particular angle 
of the struggle that involves Italy and Austria, 
and his book is essentially a defence of Italy's 
course. 

Each of the two corresponding sections of this 
large endeavor is in four parts. The first part 
deals with recent history with the relations be- 
tween Italy and Austria for the past century 
and portrays in detail the arrogances, injustices, 
and inhumanities of the long Austrian domina- 
tion. The second part comprises a longer his- 
torical retrospect one of two thousand years 
and is designed to prove the essentially Italian 
character of the borderlands in dispute between 
the two countries. The third part gives an ac- 
count of the diplomatic doings which immediately 
preceded the declaration of war a complete and 
compact presentation of the actual documents. 
The fourth and concluding part gives the rea- 
sons a dozen or so which justified Italy in 
breaking with the Central Powers and in join- 
ing France and England. 

One feature of the book a feature illustra- 
tively picturesque is a plate giving in facsimile 
the famous "Tavola Clesiana," a bronze tablet 
which was discovered at Cles, in mid-Tyrol, in 
1869. This tablet contains a decree of the Em- 
peror Claudius, A. D. 49, determining the essen- 
tially Italian character of the inhabitants of that 
region. The find was viewed in situ by Theodor 
Mommsen, who published a pamphlet on it and 
declared himself convinced that the district of 
Trent was Italian and properly belonged to 
Roman Italy. The proofs with regard to Trieste 
and to the strong Italian affiliation of the Trien- 
tines are equally cogent, as presented by the 
author. If the same were the case with the 
Triestine hinterland (which is predominantly 
Slav), the question of Italia Irredenta might be 
much simplified. 

Mr. Carnovale, who has a reputation as a 
journalist both in Italy and America, is one of 
the younger school of radical reformers. He is 
against not only the Papacy but also the House 
of Savoy; and against not only the House of 
Savoy but also the capitalistic forces which (as 
depicted by Anatole France in his "He des 
Penguins") often take an undue part in orig- 
inating and in furthering wars. As a resident of 
Chicago, he casts his eye not only over the Great 



War, but over some of the lesser wars which, 
in our own city and country, have been caused 
by economic injustice. He pronounces the pres- 
ent war "the logical and natural epilogue of the 
evils committed by the privileged class during its 
long dominion over the world," and looks for- 
ward hopefully to a better day guided by better 
men. 

ITALY AT WAR. By Alexander Powell. 

Scribner's; $1.50. 

In his latest book Mr. Alexander Powell has 
unreservedly adopted Davis's maxim "to use 
similes that the man at home can understand. 
If China is not home bring it there." He says 
that Verdun looked "as though it had been \ is- 
ited simultaneously by the San Francisco earth- 
quake, the Baltimore fire, and the Johnstown 
flood." He speaks of lunching in the under- 
ground citadel as being like eating "in a New 
York subway station." While this trick has a 
tendency to become tiresome, Mr. Powell de- 
serves little but praise for the way in which he 
has presented the outstanding features of the 
Italian campaign its political preparation, its 
division into the four great theatres, the novel 
methods introduced by warfare on the roof of 
the world, the blasting of trenches in ice and 
rock, the communication by means of the tele- 
ferica, the cable lines by which men, munitions, 
and food must be swung aloft to the front lines. 
That the Italian line when straightened is longer 
than the entire western front, that the Italians 
alone of the allies are now fighting almost en- 
tirely upon enemy ground, and that they have 
gained this position through forcing their way 
upward in the face of a superior enemy all 
these facts exhibit the sturdy determination of 
the people who are fighting for Italia Irredenta. 
Theirs has been a stupendous task, a task that 
no people without national imagination and 
adaptability could have contemplated. 

Mr. Powell adds chapters on the British in 
France, the French at Verdun, the Russians in 
Champagne, and the re-formed Belgian army in 
Flanders. He has a talent for collecting inter- 
esting scraps of information and adapting tech- 
nical details of artillery or aviation to the com- 
prehension of the uninitiated. 

GREAT BRITAIN'S PART. By Paul D. 

Cravath. Appleton; $1. 

Similar in plan and purpose to Mrs. Humphry 
Ward's "England's Effort," Mr. Cravath's short 
account of "Great Britain's Part," as viewed 
by an American observer in France at the be- 
ginning of the third year of the war, heightens 
one's admiration for the zeal and devotion and 
increasing intelligence with which that country 
is applying her energies to the formidable task

in hand. Already familiar to readers of the 
New York "Times," these short, crisp chapters 
now appeal to a still larger public; and at the 
present juncture, unforeseen when they were 
written, they will have a peculiar interest and 
may teach a useful lesson. "We shall doubtless 
continue," concludes the author, "to hear much 
of blunders that England is making and of blun- 
ders that she is not making, but some day the 
world will wake up to a realization that England 
and her allies have won the war. Even then 
the critics in and out of Parliament will doubtless 
insist that the war was lost by the blunders of 
an incompetent government. That has always 
been England's way." 

A STUDENT IN ARMS. Second Series. By 

Donald Hankey. Dutton; $1.50. 

"A Student in Arms" proved that war litera- 
ture need be neither journalistic nor sentimental. 
Mr. Hankey's "Second Series" of the book fur- 
ther shows the effect of the war on a nature that 
was singularly refined, instinctively timid, but 
victorious over the common dangers and fears and 
vulgarities of soldiering not by reason of any 
dulling of the sensibilities, but rather through a 
determined calm and an undistorted insight into 
the true values of life at the front. This view 
enabled Mr. Hankey to understand and to con- 
demn the weaknesses of his fellow-men without 
condemning their too natural manifestation. It 
enabled him to appreciate the full horror of 
trench life with its perpetual and exhausting 
strain without becoming pessimistic over the tem- 
porary necessity for such things nor their final 
result. He could not bring himself "to loathe 
militarism in all its forms," for he appreciated 
the good side of militarism, which is the laying 
down of the trifling search for self-realization. 
"For though the part of the great push that it 
fell to my lot to see was not a successful part," he 
wrote, "it was none the less a triumph a spir- 
itual triumph. The war correspondent can only 
describe the outside of things. We who are in 
the Army, who know the men as individuals, 
who have talked with them, joked with them, 
censored their letters, worked with them, we see 
below the surface. . . The man has become 
humble, but in proportion the soldier has be- 
come exceeding proud. He has learnt to sacri- 
fice everything which belongs to him individu- 
ally to a cause that is far greater than any per- 
sonal ambitions of his own can ever be." To 
recognize romance when it comes disguised in 
the form of an urgent demand for a quiet life, 
is a thing that few of us can compass. It is the 
thing that makes all the difference in the world 
between Mr. Hankey's book and most of the 
others. 



THE WAR AFTER THE WAR. By Isaac F. 

Marcosson. Lane; $1.25. 

The picture that Mr. Marcosson here paints 
is depressing. But it provokes thought, and 
thereby serves its purpose. The picture is that 
of the nations of the world locked in deadly 
commercial contest after the present titanic con- 
flict of arms shall have ceased. After the war 
will begin in' earnest, we are told, the struggle 
for markets, for shipping, and for industrial ad- 
vantage. "Embattled commercial groups will 
supplant embroiled nations; boycotts, discrimina- 
tions, and exclusions will succeed the strategies 
of line and trench; the animosities fought out 
today with shell and steel will have their heri- 
tage in ruthless rivalries." 

The point to the volume is obvious: the 
United States will be subjected to an economic 
competition such as she has never known; she 
will pass almost instantly from the exceptionally 
favored position she occupied during the first 
two years and a half of the war to a position in 
which every trader's hand will be against her; 
she must lose no time in calculating her future 
policies, and in matching military with economic 
preparedness. Mr. Marcosson wrote before the 
United States entered the war, and on the as- 
sumption that she would not be drawn in. But 
his major thesis is not notably affected by the 
change of circumstances. His argument is, on 
the whole, plausible ; and he states it in a Sunday- 
supplement style which may be expected to give 
his book a considerable vogue. The danger of 
commercial isolation and decadence of the 
United States seems, however, exaggerated. It 
is true that war is waste, that "some one must 
pay," and that the embattled nations will be 
feverishly anxious after peace is restored to re- 
build their industries, rehabilitate their shipping, 
and regain or extend their foreign markets. But 
for some time a very great portion of the ener- 
gies of reconstruction will have to be expended 
at home; sheer exhaustion will hold back com- 
mercial operations abroad. 

It is not clear that the relative position of the 
United States, even if she herself is somewhat 
weakened by war, will be greatly altered. Three 
years ago she was in many respects commercially 
backward. Her manufacturers, merchants, and 
bankers were only beginning to awaken to their 
lack of progressiveness in meeting the competi- 
tion of German, French, and British capital. 
Mr. Marcosson's admonition to American pro- 
ducers and traders to bestir themselves is to the 
point. But so it would have been, in almost 
equal degree, before the war began. Readable 
sketches of Lloyd George and the doughty Aus- 
tralian premier, William Hughes, are fairly 
dragged in ; but they close the volume pleasantly.

GERMAN IMPERIALISM AND INTERNA- 
TIONAL LAW. By Jacques Marquis de 
Dampierre. Scribner; $3.50. 
Here is another contribution to that already 
extensive literature whose purpose is to expose 
the unholy ideals, ambitions, and doctrines of 
Germany. The author examines German the- 
ories of international law as they are expounded 
by the jurists, as they are formulated in the Ger- 
man military code, and as they have been applied 
in practice during the present war. These the- 
ories embrace such doctrines as that might makes 
right, that in war the end justifies the means, 
that the rights of belligerents are older than those 
of neutrals and must take precedence, that the 
employment of all means that will contribute to 
the attainment of the object of the war is 
permissible, and so on. All these and similar 
ideas the author condemns, and he justly remarks 
that it is the glory of the human race from its 
earliest origins to have striven to restrict as far 
as possible the uncontrolled sway of violence and 
brute force. 

As violence and terrorism in war are a part 
of the German military code, so imperialism is 
one of its dominating political ambitions. On 
the pretense that Germany must have "a place 
in the sun" the pan-German propagandists are 
advocating the forcible absorption of all terri- 
tories belonging to other nations, and this move- 
ment M. Dampierre examines in detail. 

A large part of his book is devoted to a study 
of the German policy of spoliation and terrorism 
in Belgium and France, and on the basis of evi- 
dence gathered from German sources, especially 
from diaries kept by German soldiers in accord- 
ance with the field-service regulations, M. Dam- 
pierre convicts the Germans of numerous atroci- 
ties which their government has repeatedly de- 
nied. Facsimile reproductions of extracts from 
many of these incriminating diaries are pub- 
lished by the author and their authenticity would 
seem to be beyond question. 

RUSSIA OF YESTERDAY AND TOMORROW. 

By Baroness Souiny. Century; $2. 

We have here an absolutely recent picture of 
Russia, in which we see the great mass of igno- 
rant peasants, the pleasure-loving nobles, the 
timid czar, and the intriguing politicians. Most 
interesting is the author's reaction to the revolu- 
tion. She makes it very plain that she has little 
faith in the lasting powers of the democracy. 
She asserts that the people are too ignorant to 
understand what a democracy really is. They 
see it as a government that will give them more 
cows and chickens and absolute freedom. They 
do not realize that they will still have to submit 
to simple laws; they do not see that a republic 



is primarily a business enterprise organized for 
utilitarian purposes. Enslaved as they have been, 
they over-idealize liberty. Moreover, they can- 
not respect a man whom they themselves have 
put into office. To their simple religious minds, 
their ruler must be one who reigns by divine 
right. If the democracy does succeed, the Bar- 
oness can only see the Russians being transformed 
into unimaginative cogs in a dreary industrial 
machine. 

There are also chapters on "The Military 
Party," "The Russian Court," "The German 
Influence in Russia," "America and Russia," and 
so on chapters filled with evidence of the 
author's perspicacity and journalistic ability. 
There is not a little social and political gossip, 
too: stories, more or less scandalous, touching 
many people in high places. Among other word 
pictures is one of the monk, Gregory Rasputin. 
The Baroness sees him as a simple peasant, ab- 
solutely patriotic and religious, a "Russian Billy 
Sunday" who brought peace and self-confidence 
to the czar and czarina when they most needed 
it. She admits that he loved the things of the 
flesh, but that does not spoil him in her eyes. 
Taken as a whole, these impressions of Russia 
by a Russian are necessarily more authoritative 
than those of a foreigner. Nevertheless we hope 
that her fears that her people are" unready for 
self-government are baseless. 

THE LIFE OF THE GRASSHOPPER. By 
J. Henri Fabre. Dodd, Mead; $1.50. 
When a man has been called the Homer of 
his subject, it would seem either that the last 
word of praise has been said, or that the man 
is in need of resuscitation. There is something 
narcotic, as well as glorious, about the word 
Homer and the revivifying touch cannot be 
wholly out of place. J. Henri Fabre, author 
of the famous and popular volumes on the lives 
of insects, is as alive and interesting as George 
M. Cohan. An attentive reader of any one of 
Fabre's books will be nothing less than awed by 
the tireless observation which is the background 
of his simple narrative. He thought it but 
pleasure to sit through whole days and nights 
waiting for some indifferent bug to perform one 
of its functions. And he was little short of a 
genius when it came to experimentation, when 
the need came for a device or trick to catch his 
pets at their singing or mating. In reporting 
what he had at last seen, he was again unusual : 
he reported with the hand of the common per- 
son, he took almost extreme care to choose the 
everyday word, and the ludicrous aspect thus 
thrown upon Latin terminology is one of the 
of his books. Fabre was above all a plain 
human being; his studies had made him what all 
lv makes all worthy men, humble and wor- 



1917]

shipful in the face of the mystery of life; and 
he could not resist a kindly dig now and then 
in the ribs of the pedagogues and pedants. To 
give any idea of the charm of his work, of his 
infusion of the human into his record, of his 
own personality as it is delightfully shown in his 
pages, would be impossible in a brief review. 
His is one of those books that can only be grate- 
fully recommended. 

Do WE NEED A NEW IDEA OF GOD. By 
Edmund H. Reeman. Jacobs; $1. 
The war, productive of so much reactionary 
opinion in certain directions, opens up liberal 
thought and statement in others. Theology at 
present feels its liberating influence. Many 
pious people have watched with growing wonder 
the devastating course of three years of terrific 
world-strife without a single clear manifestation 
of God's intervention; and they are now well 
prepared for such a book as Mr. Reeman's. The 
author suggests his purpose in the first words 
of the preface as "a reinterpretation of life and a 
restatement of religious faith in the light of 
democratic outreach and impulse." This sounds 
commonplace enough and many disappointing 
and boresome books have begun with similar high 
enterprise. But this book makes good. "There 
are . . . many who feel that the great dem- 
ocratic uprising of the world cannot be without 
its effect upon our thought of God, and who are 
finding it increasingly difficult to reconcile the 
oligarchic and monarchial elements that predom- 
inate in our common God-ideas with modern 
democratic urge and impulse." The key to this 
pragmatic statement is "democratic," and it also 
suggests the striking difference between this book 
and the most prominent current pronouncement 
on the same subject H. G. Wells's "God the 
Invisible King." Both books are good on the 
destructive side, with the balance decidedly in 
favor of Wells. Constructively, however, the 
British writer seems, in comparison, vague, tru- 
istic, naive, and dogmatic. Though a socialist, 
Mr. Wells still conceives God as the archaic 
head of a monarchy of men's souls; the purpose 
of Mr. Reeman is mainly to combat that con- 
ception. The chapters "God and Democracy" 
and "The Nature of the Life Force" contain 
much of the important argument and most of the 
finest eloquence. Both writers conceive of God 
as finite, holding up men's hands and being held 
up by them, but Mr. Wells is vague in differen- 
tiating God from the Life Force and maintain- 
ing his personality, while Mr. Reeman is per- 
fectly clear in identifying the two and in giving 
the doctrine of Divine Immanence a modern 
pragmatic meaning. "A God in an easy chair, or 
upon a monarch's throne; a God in a distant 
heaven and with a court and retinue of angels; 



a God working by the easy method of direct fiat 
and command; a God seeking only from men 
the idle flattery of lip homage and temple wor- 
ship and moved and swayed in action by the 
selfish prayers of men; a God incarnate in but 
one human form and dying but one death for 
the emancipation of the race . . . will not 
fit, and cannot anyhow be made to fit, in the 
presence of this unspeakable cosmic struggle by 
which alone the thought of a larger life has been 
won." "The only God-thought, I believe, that 
can fit our needs and the facts of our knowledge 
of the great cosmic struggle is the thought of a 
God dying a thousand deaths daily and pouring 
out His life's blood unceasingly in continuous 
struggle the God, in a word, of a mighty eter- 
nal urge and effort and of the struggle itself, 
with Whom our highest relationships and com- 
munion, if to such we are to attain at all, must be 
those of comrades and fellow-workers in the 
building of a universe and in the translation into 
ethical values of physical forces." The new "At- 
one-ment" is easily imagined from the following: 
"Human history, indeed, as I read it, is the 
story of a long and painful outreach toward good- 
ness on the part of men, and not at all the story 
of a long continued and wilful rebellion against 
God." 

On the whole a most tactful and satisfactory 
book! 

THE PRINCE OF PARTHIA: A Tragedy. 
By Thomas Godfrey. Edited with an In- 
troduction by Archibald Henderson. Little, 
Brown. 

It seems strange that while so many early 
American writings of less importance have been 
reprinted, the first tragedy written by an Amer- 
ican should heretofore have been available only 
in the original edition of 1765. At last an at- 
tractive reprint appears on the occasion of the 
one-hundred-fiftieth anniversary of the first stage 
representation of the play in Philadelphia. Pro- 
fessor Archibald Henderson, of the University of 
North Carolina, furnishes an extended introduc- 
tion. Thomas Godfrey, the author of "The 
Prince of Parthia," is usually associated with his 
native city of Philadelphia, but his new editor 
stresses the fact that the play was written at 
Wilmington, N. C. a city, as the reader is more 
than once reminded, "noted afar for its lavish 
hospitality and the polite learning of its inhabi- 
tants." 

Notwithstanding the reputation of the elder 
Godfrey as a mathematician and that of the 
younger as a poet, biographical information re- 
garding either is meagre. The picture of the 
father in Franklin's "Autobiography," the 
memoir of the son by his fellow-poet, Nathaniel 
Evans, and the references in the life of Provost 



216 



[September 13 



William Smith are fairly well known. Profes- 
sor Henderson has made careful search in more 
obscure places, and is able to add some data 
regarding Godfrey's life, and especially regarding 
the performance of the play. Authenticated facts 
are, however, less numerous than inferences, and 
it is evident that to a professor of pure mathe- 
matics "doubtless" in the statement of a con- 
clusion means something far different from "Q. 
E. D." When a real nugget is found, the most 
is made of it. It is an interesting, if not an 
important bit of information, that in 1760 the 
name of the poet appears in a list of delinquents 
who did not work out their road tax as required 
by law. But was it necessary to add : "Thomas 
Godfrey, like many of us, cared more for poems 
than for picks, for spondees than for spontoons. 
Perhaps," etc., etc.? It would have been more 
profitable if the editor had developed farther 
his few excellent comments on the young drama- 
tist's literary relationships. 

Godfrey was in no sense a great poet, not 
even a poet of great promise; but he was re- 
markable for the number and the variety of the 
English masters whom he was able, at the age 
of twenty-three, to echo in a way that showed 
appreciation if not originality. It is still worth 
while to inquire how far this feeling for the truer 
English poetry was common in the Philadelphia 
and the Wilmington of his day, and how far he 
was, notwithstanding his few advantages and his 
early death, an individual prophet of better 
things in the literary development of his section 
of the country. Many known facts go to show 
that his real importance in the history of 
eighteenth-century American literature has not 
been adequately recognized. 

AN ESSAY ON SHAKESPEARE'S RELATION 
TO TRADITION. By Janet Spens. Black- 
well. 

Dr. Spens has given us a stimulating and 
suggestive treatment of a subject too little un- 
derstood. Her book is a distinct contribution 
to the group of works dealing with the evolution 
of literature. We are now grown accustomed 
to the idea of evolution in literary types; we 
know the steps by which the Greek drama was 
evolved out of the worship of Dionysus and the 
English out of certain parts of the church serv- 
ice; but we had not thought it necessary to go a 
step further and admit the evolution of the stuff 
or content of literature. Indeed, supposing orig- 
inality to be a great and shining virtue, we have 
insisted on the ugliness of the sin of plagiarism 
and have felt rather perplexed, not to say shocked, 
at the way Chaucer and Shakespeare and Milton 
helped themselves to the great "common store- 
house of nature." Now along comes Miss Spens 
and convinces us that we had considerably under- 



estimated Shakespeare's debt to his predecessors. 
It is not the sort of debt, however, that detract* 
from his greatness; on the other hand, it tends 
to increase our admiration for the manner in 
which he transmutes the base metal of popular 
games and customs and characters into the pure 
gold of his plays. Miss Spens finds many traces 
of folk-plays survivals of early religious rites 
in Shakespeare. The fool, for example, is not 
merely a courtly appendage; he is in origin the 
old year, and in his death at the hands of his 
sons, as in the Revesby sword-play, we "see 
dimly the story of the decay and death and re- 
birth of life in man and beast and dumb na- 
ture." In the second part, Miss Spens shows 
how the ancient scapegoat passes into the hero- 
sufferer (CEdipus), who in turn passes into the 
man-god, and finally into the Senecan human 
monstrosity, whom the divine mania, descending 
on him, enables to perform superhuman deeds. 
Shakespeare, though rejecting the superhuman, 
deals essentially, in Hamlet, Lear, Julius Caesar, 
Coriolanus, and Macbeth, with the same con- 
ception of honor, the performance of a deed 
which shall make the hero equal to the gods. 
Thus it may be said that essentially the revenge 
plot had its origin in those dim ages of the past 
when there was no difference known between 
the human and the divine, when Jahve walked 
in the garden, and Prometheus stole fire from 
heaven. 

THE LIFE OF LAZARILLO DE TORMES. 
Translated by Louis How. Mitchell Ken- 
nedy; $1.50. 

The story of Lazarillo's experiences with his 
many masters and his piquant satire of society 
in sixteenth century Spain is too famous to need 
a summary. "Great secrets, Lord, are those that 
thou makest and people are ignorant of! Who 
will not be deceived by that fair appearance and 
decent cape and coat?" It is the intention of 
the author to reveal those secrets and expose 
the torn lining of that decent cape. He accom- 
plishes his task in the most picturesque language, 
and one wonders whether the charm this first 
of Spanish picaresque romances continues to hold 
for translators is not often as much in its diffi- 
culty as in its intrinsic merit. Mr. How has 
attempted a literal version; he goes so far as 
frequently to sacrifice smooth English in his ef- 
fort to keep the construction of the original. 
The result is occasionally a racy bit of phrasing, 
but too often the reader misses the craftsmanship 
of the anonymous author. The notes, by Mr. 
Charles P. Wagner, will be of interest to 
serious students of Spanish. Some of the latter 
will doubtless wish to quarrel with Mr. Hmv 
over a few of his renderings. It would seem 
that attention should be called to pla\s on words 



1917]

even if they cannot be translated. For instance, 
on page 36, Mr. How makes Lazarillo say of 
his second master: "to make use of my dodges 
I had no chance, because I had nowhere to make 
him jump," thus alluding to the young scamp's 
vengeance on the blind beggar. This may be 
accepted as one meaning, but the Spanish phrase 
is por no tener en que dalle salto and signifies 
also "because he had nothing of which I could 
rob him." The art of translation is more diffi- 
cult than is commonly realized and Mr. How's 
version, though creditable, is not the final one. 

THE LIFE OF JAMES J. HILL. By Joseph 
Gilpin Pyle. Doubleday, Page ; $5. 
Empire-building, whether it be done by an 
Alexander, a Caesar, a Napoleon, or a modern 
captain of industry, is an attractive field for his- 
torical writers. It is only in recent years, how- 
ever, that the captains of industry are coming to 
their own. Some of these captains have combined 
industry and politics, leaving out war. Among 
the comparatively recent additions to historical 
literature based on modern empire-building may 
be mentioned the life of Lord Strathcona and 
the autobiography of Sir George Reid. To this 
list Mr. Pyle now adds his "Life of James J. 
Hill." All three men came directly or indi- 
rectly out of the British Isles. The first two 
continued to build for the mother country, the 
first in Canada, the second in Australia. The 
third was born in Canada, but crossed into the 
United States and figured largely in the build- 
ing of the great Northwest. His chief inter- 
est was in fuel and transportation. In both, 
he generally had the business acumen to see just 
a little farther than anybody else. This is par- 
ticularly true of the connection between coal and 
railroads. In the early days when the roads were 
cording wood along the Mississippi, Mr. Hill 
was cataloguing the quality and quantity of coal 
in Minnesota. In the '70's when some railroad 
builders needed the best coal deposits of Iowa, 
they were, says Mr. Pyle, "amazed to find 2300 
acres of valuable coal lands in one county under 
lease by James J. Hill." While Mr. Hill was 
monopolizing the coal lands, others were com- 
bining the railroads. In 1870 the Northern 
Pacific began buying up other lines. Separate or- 
ganizations were maintained, but the directorates 
were identical, not simply interlocking. This 
was the day of high financing. Company No. 1 
would make a contract with itself as Company 
No. 2 and then issue bonds, the proceeds of which 
for building often amounted to less than 50 per 
cent. Then came the panic of 1873, after which 
Mr. Hill bought up the bankrupt roads and 
finally decided to make railroading, not fuel, his 
major business. At a time when other men 



thought the project foolish, he decided to extend 
his road to the Pacific. The connection was 
made and, presto, an empire was built. Of the 
transportation feature of that empire Mr. Hill 
was the master. The world is now at war. One 
of the parties to this war is fighting for democ- 
racy. When the future historian comes to write 
of democracy-building, let us hope that he will 
be able to tell of the democratization of industry, 
as well as of war and politics. 

RAILROAD VALUATION. By Homer Bews 

Vanderblue. Houghton Mifflin; $1.50. 

The reader of this book leaves the volume with 
a feeling of inevitable depression. Dr. Vander- 
blue has made the economics of transportation 
his special study, and his thesis for the doctorate, 
of which the present work is a revised version, 
is particularly concerned with the problem of 
finding a satisfactory basis for ascertaining a 
fair method of finding the valuation of a road, 
which valuation is to serve as a basis for deter- 
mining a just return for services rendered. The 
book is depressing because Dr. Vanderblue makes 
the reader wonder just how far we have pro- 
gressed since the Interstate Commerce Com- 
mission undertook to work out a rule for 
determining reasonable rates; and since 1913 
how much good has really been done by the 
Commission in its assigned task of making a 
physical valuation of the railroads of the coun- 
try a valuation to include such items as orig- 
inal cost, cost of reproduction anew, cost of 
reproduction less depreciation, and also intangi- 
bles, such as "going value, good will, and fran- 
chise value." Dr. Vanderblue says: "But the 
statute commits Congress to no theory of val- 
uation. The entire burden of weighing the 
elements of value is thrown upon the Commis- 
sion." "Railroad Valuation" is a discussion of 
these theories of valuation and the elements of 
valuation. In successive chapters replacement 
value, the unimpaired investment, depreciation, 
land values, and intangibles are treated in a 
thorough fashion. 

It is to be noted in passing that this book 
deals perforce with many legal problems of the 
past, and Dr. Vanderblue covers these phases 
in a clear and praiseworthy manner. The un- 
fortunate point is that the entire work appears 
colorless. It is a pity that Dr. Vanderblue has 
not given a more individual treatment embody- 
ing his own ideas on a subject so much in the 
public mind. The present work is rather on 
the order of a summary of what has been accom- 
plished, but as such it should help many a ris- 
ing economist and public official to avoid the 
"circles" in the reasoning of some of our com- 
missioners and justices.

LETTERS OF ARTHUR GEORGE HEATH. 
With Memoir by Gilbert Murray. Long- 
mans; $1.25. 

Nothing forces upon one more strongly the 
wantonness and the waste of war than the con- 
templation of the innumerable young lives of 
promise cut off on battle-field and in hospital 
during the past three years. No more lovable 
or gifted personality is to be found in this mel- 
ancholy list than Arthur George Heath, Fellow 
of New College, Oxford, and Lieutenant in the 
Royal West Kent Regiment, who fell on the 
eighth of October, 1915, his twenty-eighth birth- 
day. Distinguished for his scholarship and his 
proficiency in music, he was loved for his noble 
qualities of heart and character, and both ad- 
mired and loved for the high courage with which 
he animated the men under his command. The 
last person one would have selected for a mili- 
tary career, he applied for a commission a few 
days after the declaration of war, and threw 
himself whole-heartedly into the necessarily ab- 
horrent task, to carry it through or to die at his 
post. Gentleness and humor, forgetfulness of 
self and thoughtfulness for those at home, with 
a scholar's studiousness and earnestness, mark 
these letters from the field, mostly to the writer's 
mother, now collected and prefaced with a 
warmly appreciative memoir by Professor Gil- 
bert Murray, fellow Oxonian and fellow col- 
legian of Heath's. And so the book takes its 
place beside similar memorials of Dixon Scott 
and Rupert Brooke and scores of others, as a 
sad reminder of high possibilities of achievement 
sacrificed without a murmur, and also of high 
actualities of achievement in a great cause. 

DOING MY BIT FOR IRELAND. By Mar- 
garet Skinnider. Century; $1. 

It is one thing to read about the Great War; 
it is quite another to plunge into a fight having 
all the qualities of drama excitement, irony, and 
beauty, which the world war seems to lack. 
Perhaps these things are the peculiar product of 
revolutions, of conflicts between a small op- 
pressed group and a large powerful group, or 
between a great inarticulate mass and a sophis- 
ticated minority. When one reads Margaret 
Skinnider's account of the heroic labors of the 
Irish leaders, the pluck of the girl dispatch-bear- 
ers, of whom Miss Skinnider was one of the 
cleverest, and of the bitter end which these hot 
nationalists met at England's hands, one recalls 
the unhappy stories of another revolution, trust- 
ing that if the Irish have suffered defeats like 
the Russians they may more quickly realize Rus- 
sia's victory. For Miss Skinnider's brief story 
of Easter Week and its subsequent stupid 
tragedy is not so much an indictment of England 
as a revelation of Irish potentialities. Her de- 



scription of the misery suffered by innocent 
people, misery which one only touches when one 
has heard it with all dignity from their own 
lips, and of the fine courage and liberal hopes 
of these men and women, leaves a profound 
impression on the mind. One of the chief vir- 
tues of Miss Skinnider's simple recital is that it 
makes the Irish revolutionists live for us, espe- 
cially their executed leaders, so that the Irish 
question presents itself as an essentially human 
problem, and the rights of small nations changes 
from a battle cry to a demand for constructive 
thought. 

PHILISTINE AND GBNIUS. By Boris Sidis. 
Badger; $1. 

Dr. Sidis's little book first appeared in 1911. 
The present issue is not much changed except 
for the addition of a preface in which the author 
appears unduly impressed by the fact that he had 
predicted the Great War at that time (in com- 
pany with perhaps five hundred other writers of 
the last two decades), and a chapter on "Pre- 
cocity in Children." The arraignment of the 
American "system" of education is now so well 
known, and the main points in the indictment 
have been so long admitted that one finds it a 
little difficult to warm to what seems like the 
spectre of some antediluvian monster. In 1911 
it had more novelty. 

To-day reading that "our whole educational 
system is vicious" sounds like Mr. Britling's be- 
lated discovery of a God that thousands of 
pragmatists have known for a generation. Page 
after page about "mandarin-schoolmasters," 
"goody-goody schoolma'ams," "pettifogging offi- 
cials," "blind college owls," and "philistine peda- 
gogs" grows tiresome, partly because these 
expressions have become truistic, but mainly be- 
cause the author's fundamental assumption is 
silly; namely, that school and college exist to 
develop genius. This cannot have any truth in 
a democracy. Perhaps if Dr. Sidis had taken 
the trouble to define genius, he would have suc- 
ceeded better. It is surprising that a scientific 
man could produce so unscientific a book; no- 
where is there the slightest evidence to support 
the unceasing flow of invective against the bogey 
of our "system." What he wants is no system 
but inspired parental instruction instead, which 
might work well enough in a few enlightened 
households. 

The one thing of positive value in a book full 
of negative invective is this: "The cultivation of 
the power of habit-disintegration is what consti- 
tutes the proper education of man's genius." This 
>od, but even here you must know before- 
hand what the author means he gives no help. 
This lack of definiteness and evidence gives the 
whole an air of mediaeval ifise dixit.

GRAPES OF WRATH. By Boyd Cable. 

Dutton; $1.50. 

Boyd Cable and Ian Hay have given us a 
large part of our knowledge of what lies behind 
the meagre official reports of the war, of the 
daily humor and hardship and achievement of 
the average British Tommy in the trenches. 
"Grapes of Wrath," Mr. Cable's latest contri- 
bution, describes in general terms the Somme 
battle and more particularly the adventures of 
four modern musketeers, whose point of view 
is that of the average infantry private. "The 
wust of this blinkin' show is that nobody seems 
to know nothin' and the same people seem to 
care just about the same amount about anything" 
says Billy Simson, describing the most common 
feeling of the soldier in the trenches. When he 
helps capture a trench, he frequently does not 
know whether the enemy is before him or behind 
him, whether he is in comparative safety or in 
great danger, where he is, or why he has done 
what he has done. Often the sentiment that 
inspires him to fight is no loftier than that of 
Pug, who, having received a slight wound which 
entitled him to a week at the Base, ran back to 
join his company in the capture of a difficult 
piece of trench, and when remonstrated with 
in emphatic and picturesque terms, explained: 
"All the time I've bin out 'ere I've never 'ad a 
chance to see the inside of a German trench: 
an' now there was a fust class chance to git into 
one, an' a chance maybe of pickin' up a 'elmet 
for a soo-veneer, I thought I'd be a fool not to 
take it. I want a blinkin' 'elmet see and 
wot's more, I'm goin' to git one." 

The men do not love war, but they make the 
best of it. And when a man "stops one," as 
he has known all the time he should some day 
do, he accepts his fate just as all the rest of 
that strange life is taken, with unquestioning 
resignation. 

THE ATLANTIC CLASSICS. The Atlantic 

Monthly Co.; $1.25. 

Among the many and various impressions re- 
ceived from the essays in this volume there is one 
that is general and uniform: consciously or oth- 
erwise the most popular contributors to the "At- 
lantic Monthly," for so they are named in the 
short preface, follow what might be called the 
Atlantic outline. Just what or where are the 
sources of this impression is difficult to say, so 
difficult that the reader hesitates to express his 
feeling. But the feeling is none the less definite 
and it grows so persistent before the essays are 
finished that to leave it unexpressed is critical 
pain. This is not at all to say that the essays 
are monotonous, nor that they are alike; Dallas 
Lore Sharp's "Turtle Eggs for Agassiz," with 
its originality and movement, is as far from Ralph 



Bergengren's burlesque "In the Chair" as the 
"Atlantic" is from the "Saturday Evening Post," 
and although Owen Wister's "Reminiscence with 
Postscript" and Meredith Nicholson's "The 
Provincial American" have their likenesses, there 
is still that subtle difference which makes the 
essay an everlasting joy. Cornelia A. P. Comer's 
"Intensive Living," Zephine Humphrey's "The 
Passing of Indoors," Lucy Elliot Keeler's "The 
Contented Heart," and Margaret Sherwood's 
"The Other Side" are distinctly made to fit the 
Atlantic outline; and there are those who con- 
sider Agnes Repplier the very essence of that 
conservatism which the "Atlantic Monthly" has 
so consistently upheld. The preface says that the 
editors aimed to have this volume "constitute a 
kind of Atlantic Anthology, preserving the mag- 
azine's flavor and character and offering, as it 
were, a sample of what it aims to be." This is 
accomplished. 

MENTAL CONFLICTS AND MISCONDUCT. 
. By William Healy. Little, Brown ; $2.50. 

The thesis of this volume is well sustained. 
It proceeds upon the case method. It sets forth 
that the provocations to social misconduct in 
unstable personalities are mental repressions, 
shocks, and difficulties of adjustment. There is 
a mechanism at work which links cause and 
effect, and discloses the sources of what, for lack 
of analysis, is called crime. The deepest emo- 
tional disturbances are those of sex. The achieve- 
ment of sexual poise is the critical phase of 
maturing, and by that token is fraught with mis- 
chance. Of the forms of evidence supplied by 
Dr. Healy, the most typical and convincing is 
the association of sex shock or delinquency with 
stealing. It is hopeful that at times, even com- 
monly, with the recognition of the source of the 
trouble and its acknowledgment, relief sets in. 
The unsettlements of adolescence, masking their 
true source in the irritations and perversions of 
sex, lead to wayward and irregular periods of 
behavior in the most normal, and in the sus- 
ceptible or neurotic take the more severe form 
of anti-social transgressions. It is the illustra- 
tion of this theme in the concrete that con- 
stitutes the high value of this volume. The 
detailed study differentiates types of cases and 
shows the difficulties of diagnosis. The book 
forms a notable contribution to the group of 
writings, mostly of American origin, distinctive 
of the applied psychology of crime. It is char- 
acteristic that the American genius, sensing the 
practical value of principles enunciated by others, 
is peculiarly fertile in bringing the study to a 
valuable issue in an important phase of social 
insight and control. In this movement Dr. Healy 
is recognized as a distinguished leader.

"Christine," by Alice Cholmondeley (Mac- 
millan; $1.50), purports to be a series of letters 
written by a young Englishwoman studying mu- 
sic in Berlin during the Summer of 1914. Their 
authenticity is attested by the author's mother, 
who publishes them, she says, "just as they came 
to me, leaving out nothing," because the three 
years that have passed since Christine's brief ad- 
venture and tragic death have "been more full 
of actions on Germany's part difficult to explain 
except in one way and impossible to excuse"; 
and she felt that "these letters, giving a picture 
of the state of mind of the German public im- 
mediately before the war, and written by some 
one who went there enthusiastically ready to 
like everything and everybody, may have a cer- 
tain value in helping to put together a small 
corner of the great picture of Germany which 
it will be necessary to keep clear and naked be- 
fore us ... if the world is to be saved." 
The publisher's announcement regarding the 
alteration of some names further emphasizes the 
genuineness of these letters, as do their small 
personal touches and occasional irrelevancies to 
the progress of the story. The doubt as to their 
legitimacy comes when one reads the initial one, 
which, like all first letters in epistolary novels, 
retails to the ostensible recipient all the facts the 
reader needs to know. And as one reads on, the 
natural development of events, the study of the 
actions and reactions of different classes of Ger- 
mans to war and then to the war, no less than 
the fluency of the style, seem to indicate that 
"Christine" is a clever, interesting, but fabri- 
cated, narrative. 

This curiosity about its authoritativeness is 
largely due to its being a fresh indictment against 
Germany, the more terrible because it is written 
by a young woman whose personal charm and 
musical genius should have brought her any- 
thing but the disagreeable and disconcerting 
treatment which she received at the hands of her 
fellow-boarders, her casual acquaintances, and 
the Junker relatives of her Prussian fiance. The 
picture of a whole people, fighting-mad, organ- 
izing for war, bellowing for war, rejoicing over 
war, as boys organize and shout for and exult 
over a boat-race, remains somewhat incredible. 
Christine believes that "the world is to be 
saved" only if Germany is "beaten ... so 
beaten, so punished . . . that she will be 
jerked by main force into line with modern life 
. . . taught that the world is too grown up 
now to put up with the smashings and destruc- 
tions of a greedy and brutal child." One closes 
the book with the hopeless feeling that the only 
way out is the crushing of the German people 
It is a tribute to the persuasiveness of "Christine" 



that one forgets for the moment that the letters 
deal with Prussia rather than with Germany, 
with Junkers and their deluded adherents rather 
than with the thousands of disappointed liberals 
u ho will play their part in building a sounder 
Europe. 

Mrs. Kathleen Norris has an uncomfortable 
way of making you feel that the problem is the 
important thing in her books, whereas it is not 
her contribution to the discussion of divorce, and 
of women's rights or duties or temptations, that 
^ r i\rs her her claim to recognition. These she 
discusses competently and conventionally; tlu-> 
are her title, her literary tag. Just which one 
is responsible for the birth of "Martie the Un- 
conquered" (Doubleday, Page; $1.35) is of no 
consequence; whereas her handling of character 
and her power of rendering the details of village 
life are worthy of attention. The picture <>r 
Malcolm Monroe's household, dominated by the 
suspicions of a petty tyrant, is an excellent bit 
of domestic comedy. Bonestell's drugstore, 
where the young folk of Monroe gather for 
pink sodas; the library' steps where they meet 
and shyly depart on Sunday afternoon walks; 
the drab existence of New York boarding-houses 
and flats ; the dull reality of the mediocre actor's 
days and nights, these scenes and this youth 
are part of our American life and they are 
sketched with a skill that is really notable. 

If you are one of those people who can de- 
tect a periscope in a drifting lobster-pot, and un- 
mask the treachery of a whole wireless system in 
a roof-garden clothes-reel, you will enjoy "My 
Country," by George Rothwell Brown (Small, 
Maynard ; $1.35). For not only are we allowed 
submarines, and collapsible wireless stations, and 
code telegrams, and great Danes, and German 
lieutenants, and disguises, but Washington itself 
stands "hands up!" while we go through official 
pockets. It is unfortunate that the author should 
have allowed the conspirators to escape so easily, 
and we must hope that the final allegiance of 
Frieda will be a lasting one, considering her 
achievements, but the story is a thrilling one and 
offers a serious idea or two besides. 

Strange that the English, steeped in ancestry 
and civilization, should write so far more poign- 
antly of the hold upon man of the primitive 
and the things of earth, than we, the pioneers. 
Mary Webb is one of these more sympathetic 
English. In "Gone to Earth" (Dutton; $1.50) 
she writes of her corner of the Welsh moun- 
tains with a very real understanding of the 
country folk, and also, alas, with unmistakable 
sentimentality. This is the more regrettable in 
that her earlier novel was free from false emo- 
tionalism and exaggerated pathos. "Gone to 
Earth" suffers from both these faults.

CASUAL COMMENT 



THE PUBLISHER OF THE DIAL wishes to 
reiterate the policy which he is seeking to follow 
in the present crisis. From his own experience 
he understands how difficult it is not to give 
oneself over to complete hatred and loathing in 
the presence of Prussian barbarism. Neverthe- 
less, it is his firm conviction that the winning of 
a permanent peace does not lie through the emo- 
tional indulgence of hate. Indeed the desire 
for revenge and punishment, reasonable as it 
seems to be, is actually treacherous to the ideals 
now at stake in this war for democracy. 

If anyone has the privilege of hatred at this 
time, it is those men who have voluntarily put 
aside the continued assurance of health and well- 
being, and have taken up the business of pre- 
paring themselves in the Officers' Camps for 
participation in the war. Yet there was no trace 
of this hysteria; instead, the camps were charac- 
terized by a superb feeling of consecration to a 
duty which loomed bigger than personal welfare 
or comfort. If, then, these men who are about 
to engage in the actual terrors and hazards of 
war are above the hysteria of hatred, is it for 
those who remain securely at home to yield to 
an easy emotionalism? 

However the war started it has now clearly 
resolved itself into a war "to deliver the free 
peoples of the world from the menace and the 
actual power of a vast military establishment 
controlled by an irresponsible government." The 
President has stated again and again that "this 
power is not the German people." 

Unless each one of us resists the easy and 
popular inclination to hatred, passion will blur 
our national vision and the purpose of the war 
will be defeated. 

We are fighting for a liberalized world, one 
in which democracy is safe and practical. Peace 
can be made only upon that basis. It is not pos- 
sible to consider dealing with the Prussian mili- 
tary government, but it is necessary that we deal 
with the liberalized German people. The Ger- 
man people have in actuality suffered as much 
from Prussianism as have the Allies. But it 
must be perceived that Prussianism is a habit 
of mind rather than a concrete institution or 
group of people, and as such its ultimate defeat 
will be on the plane of the intellect rather than 
of brute force. 

It is therefore the duty of every one of us 
behind the firing line to rise above blind, unrea- 
soning, indiscriminate emotionalism and perceive 
that the real issue of the war is an intellec- 
tual issue. It is necessary that military force 
be met with military force ; that is being done by 
our men at the front. But unless we back them 
up with clear, constructive thinking, we shall 



not only hinder their success but actually betray 
them ; for without such thinking peace will see a 
return to a world of mutual distrust, suspicion, 
and hatred. 

Is this war to have been in vain? Is all the 
human anguish to be wasted? It is for us here 
at home to determine. We can continue "straf- 
ing" the enemy. We can plunge deeper into 
mob hysteria and the insanity of cowardly bit- 
terness. Or we can rise above the present tragedy 
and see the ultimate solution. That solution, 
which now begins to assume the aspect of a 
vast stride forward in the spiritual and social 
life of the world, is an intellectual solution, which 
can only be attained by the impartial, dispas- 
sionate analysis of the philosophic mind. Only 
so can the creative work of democracy be carried 
forward out of the confusions and clamor of 
battle to permanent and enduring peace. 



THE MEMORIAL HOTEL may be accepted as a 
commemorative novelty, though hostelries bearing 
the names of families locally prominent are to be 
found in many of our large cities. Yet a hotel 
reared to the memory of a literary man and 
named for him may be taken as unique. A syn- 
dicate of North Carolina capitalists has arranged 
to erect at Greensboro, in that state, a seven- 
story edifice to be known as the O. Henry Hotel. 
The idea commends itself. Memorial statues 
and memorial libraries are alike commonplace. 
The South may need statues, and it may need 
libraries still more ; but it needs good hotels more 
than either. It is fitting enough that a roof for 
attracting and harboring the various phases of 
life should be spread in memory of a man whose 
writings reveal so much interest in the miscella- 
neous characteristics of our humankind as it 
runs ; and it is likely enough that O. Henry's 
spirit, if still cognizant of mundane affairs, will 
take pleasure in the ebb and flow of the human 
tide through the big and hospitable caravan- 
serai that is to bear his name. When will there 
be a Whitcomb Riley Hotel for Indianapolis, a 
Bailey Aldrich Hotel for "Rivermouth"? 



TOWARD WHAT is JOHN GALSWORTHY 
HEADED? In his earlier days the social interest 
engaged predominantly his attention, as witness 
"The Man of Property," "The Country House," 
"The Patrician," and such plays as "Justice" 
and "The Silver Box." Latterly the social in- 
terest seems to have become subordinated to the 
sexual interest. The change first became mark- 
edly noticeable in "The Dark Flower," and it is 
still more so in his latest novel, "Beyond." Is it 
his taste and purpose to enter yet farther into 
the saffron penumbra of sex, and if so, why? The 



222 



THE DIAL 



[September 13 



novel fully justifies itself when, like a bas-relief, 
it deals with many figures in their general rela- 
tions and connections; no imperative need to 
limit oneself to a small group isolated and han- 
dled intensively "in the round." Does Gals- 
worthy, as a fictionist past his youthful strength, 
select the sexual line as the line of least resistance 
as the course able to yield the maximum effect 
with the minimum expenditure of effort? Or has 
he, in the latter stages of his career, come to feel, 
with Hardy, that the fundamental, elemental re- 
lation between man and woman is the only rela- 
tion which, in the end, profoundly matters? It 
is well to remember that, while man and woman 
may be but man and woman when envisaging 
each other, there are many other phases of human 
relationship involved, and that the novel may 
detach and specialize to the detriment of its essen- 
tially social nature and to the partial negation 
of its possibilities and even of its duties. 



MUST THE READING WORLD FORM AN ANTI- 
LOVE-LETTER ASSOCIATION? Shall we go on al- 
lowing ourselves full liberty to consume in print 
the amatory effusions of distinguished men lately 
dead ? Shall we make no stand against the ready 
cooperative enterprise of survivors and publish- 
ers? A disquieting report is in circulation that 
a collection of letters written by James Whit- 
comb Riley to a woman he was once engaged to 
marry may soon be issued in print. The period 
covered is none too recent, being from 1877 to 
1885, but the death of the poet is; and his let- 
ters, written "at the rate of three per week" 
(such is the commercial intimation as to the bulk 
of the material), may impinge rather unpleas- 
antly upon the sensibilities of a surviving circle 
of relatives and friends and may even prejudice 
a fame recently consolidated and consecrated by 
death. This sort of thing is becoming too fre- 
quent, and is being carried too far. How many 
will join in a solemn, decorous oath not to read 
these letters if they are published? 



THE EFFECT OF THE WAR ON PRINTING- 
OFFICES AND TYPE-FOUNDRIES may be felt in an 
urgent advertisement which appears in an Eng- 
lish booksellers' organ: "A Duty," it cries in 
big black-face. There is a scarcity of lead, it 
seems; the supply is insufficient to keep shrapnel- 
bullet manufacturers and other munition-makers 
at full pressure. Many publishers and printers 
have under their control stocks of old type, old 
stereotypes, old electrotypes, and. so on, which 
they are hesitating to discard, or which they find 
difficulty in releasing owing to shortage of labor. 
As the Ministry of Munitions controls lead and 
practically fixes the price, which is unlikely to 



rise and which if the end of the war appears 
even remotely in sight is likely to fall, owners 
are urged to sell without delay. "We offer full 
market value for these metals," says the foundry 
advertising, "and would use them for the manu- 
facture of shrapnel bullets." Per contra, there 
is a caution from another quarter against allow- 
ing old films to get out of the count ry and to 
reach Germany, where the material could be 
used in the manufacture of munitions. Thus in 
these days of general depletion all sorts of scraps 
and leavings are coming to have their value. 



BOOKSELLING AS A STUDY is receiving in- 
creased attention in various parts of the world. 
The Leipzig Book Trade Institute offers a pro- 
fessional course of one year, under the patronage 
of the Saxon Ministry of Instruction, at Dres- 
den. Eligible students are those who have had 
some practical experience or who can present a 
one-year certificate of Voluntariat such unpaid 
service with a publishing or bookselling house 
as was common, a few years back, among 
young Germans in London. The French have 
a Book Trade Instruction Course under the 
auspices of the Paris Cercle de la Librairie. This 
course runs for two years and seems to lay less 
stress than the other on literature and literary 
history and more on the actual manufacture of 
the book : at least the course in literature ( French 
literature alone) comes in the last half of the 
second year. In fact, the French booksellers 
seem to have arranged an attack in force on 
Leipzig, whose extraordinary position in the 
book world is well known: from this town, Hfl 
Hachette, thirteen thousand booksellers obtain 
their wares, and one of its firms has a stock of 
30,000,000 volumes. In our own country' this 
educational movement was first taken up in Phil- 
adelphia, where the William Penn Evening High 
School has lately completed, with thirty-six stu- 
dents, its first annual course in bookselling and 
library training. None of its graduates, it is re- 
ported, have had any difficulty in securing posi- 
tions. A similar course, more or less directly 
influenced by Mr. Huebsch, is arranged for the 
Julia Richman High School, in New York. This 
is described as a forty-week course: a twenty 
weeks' survey of American literature from the 
bookseller's standpoint, and with reference to 
demands in a bookstore ; it also includes classifica- 
tion, cataloguing, and indexing. Then, a twenty 
weeks' study of the purely trade side of book- 
selling store-organization, advertising, card-cata- 
loguing of customers, and such-like details. It 
appears that book-buying, after the return of 
peace, may have its own comforts and amenities.

tralis, Incognito, being a True Relation of Certain 
English persons who, in the dayes of Queen Eliz- 
abeth, making a voyage to the East India, were 
cast away and wracked upon the Island." It is a 
small quarto of nine pages, is without place, and 
was printed by "S. G. for Allen Banks, 1668." 
"S. G." was Samuel Green, a printer at Cam- 
bridge, Massachusetts. His partner, Marmaduke 
Johnson, was fined by the General Court for print- 
ing this book without permission. He appealed to 
the Governor and the General Council, by whom 
the fine was remitted. 

This edition was a lost book until it turned up 
at the sale by Sotheby's, in London, on July 30, of 
Bishop White Kennett's collection of Americana. 
Bishop Kennett was deeply interested in mission- 
ary work in America and other lands. He pub- 
lished a catalogue of his American books, the 
earliest, or one of the earliest, on record. His 
signature is on the title-page of this work, which 
adds to its interest and value. It was described in 
the Sotheby catalogue as without frontispiece, 
which was one of the reasons why it sold cheaply. 
The Cambridge edition, however, appears to have 
had no frontispiece. Mr. Heartman, aware of the 
value of the book, instructed his London agent, Mr. 
Steevens, to obtain it for him if possible from the 
buyer. This was done. 

The catalogue attributed the work to Henry 
Neville. It has also been attributed to George 
Pine and to Cornelius van Sloettes. There 1 is 
nothing in it about America. It is a romance after 
the fashion of Swift and Defoe and Baron Munch- 
hausen. It enjoyed some popularity and was 
printed in America, England, Holland, and Ger- 
many. It consisted originally of nine pages, but 
was extended to thirty-one pages in later editions. 
A copy of one of these editions, dated the same 
year and printed in England, is in the John Carter 
Brown library. Mr. Heartman believes that the 
book is worth $2000. He will consult with the 
book-auction firms and may put it in a sale if 
they think as he does about it. Otherwise he will 
issue a reprint of it and probably present the orig- 
inal to Harvard University. 

The American Art Association, of New York, has 
not yet decided on its plans for 1917-18. The 
opening sale will not be held before November. 
The war conditions will govern its actions. The 
engagement of American troops on the European 
battlefields and any heavy loss among them would 
necessarily affect auction prices greatly. 

William Howard Samson, late vice-president of 
the Anderson Auction Company, who died recently, 
had a library of Americana and books relating to 
Lake George, New York. This library has been 
consigned to the Anderson Company and will be 
among the first sales of the season.

LIMEHOUSE 



NIGHTS 



By 

Thomas Burke 



These remarkable stories of love and 
life and death in one of the strangest 
corners of the earth have captured the 
enthusiasm of readers in England and 
America. 

H. G. Well* says: "Nor have I seen 
anywhere anything like adequate praise 
for the romantic force and beauty of Mr. 
Thomas Burke's 'Limehouse Nights.' ' 
"A work of Genius," says Clement K. 
Shorter. "Kipling has written nothing 
more powerful," declared the Liverpool 
Post. "A book of Liie."The Boston

The catalogue of the Church library of Ameri- 
cana, now owned by Henry E. Huntington, is of 
\ great interest and value to collectors. Most of the 
oipies were destroyed by fire at the bindery. 
Charles F. Heartman was anxious to obtain a 
copy. He wrote to Mr. Huntington in an effort 
to obtain a copy from him. Mr. Huntington 
replied that he had only one copy, for which he had 
paid $900. Mr. Heartman has since obtained a 
copy from George D. Smith for $500. He values it 
at $1500. 

Patrick F. Madigan, of New York, has pur- 
chased the original drawings made by Howard 
Pylc for "The Wonder Clock" and "Pepper and 
Salt," published by Harper & Brothers. The col- 
lection consists of one hundred drawings considered 
by American artists as the best pen and ink work 
that Pyle did. Mr. Madigan has sold to John L. 
Clawson, the Buffalo collector, the following letter 
of William Penn:

Sampson killed more Philistians at his death than 
in his life, let you have a care of provoking me to 
farr. They are a pack of vile brutish Spirits. Why 
will not the best of friends, and mine, stand and put 
by the numskulls yt D.L. governs. And I cannot 
think my selfe sincerely used, if this is not done and 
if they will not assist my affaires there, I must think 
my paines and charge ill bestowed here for frd's

of Coll. Quarry, ask parson Evans, and now yt I 
have writt to the Lt. Governor to desolve ye present

a new one, and am not angry with him, only yt per-

Through whom . . . had they it? How long 
would D.L.G.J. & Jos. Wil &c., have lived in England , 
before they had been members of assembley and 
justices of peace? Have they forgot their low cir-

on me or my Dept. and so encourage a chief justice

know that a good chief should so brow-beat ye quack 
lawyers, yt our primitive law of every man telling 
his own grievance, or by his frd, without ffees, should 
be renewed again, and without it we cannot hope it 
for all wise men press yt as the most capitall thing 
to a quiet Govermt. to suffer no lawyers in it. Ffor-

Dublin, frds write me again and again. I admire 
thou hast never sent me ffurs, creatures, birds, &c.,

obligations too, as greater things. 

Thy head is too full of (thou thinkest) greater 
things. By Coll. G's letter I perceive thou intendest 
over with us, which I shall be glad to see you, tho' 
it were but for 2 months time. But then I hope thou 
wilt put my affaires in good hands. It seems ye 
quantity of flour to be sent to the Palatines at Caro- 
lina, is 100 barrels of ordinary flour, but let it be 
wheaten flour. If we had 1000 quarters of flour here, 
it would be a noble cargoe, wheat being 10 and 11 
shillings a bushell in this town, and then returns 
may be in our growth, to an high advantage, praye 
mind this. 

I hope Pennsberry is upon a good bottom & at

200, and some marsh for good meddow. W. Wat- 
son, makes heavy complaint of thee and L. Lacker. 
You look upon all as your own & seem as if you 
were never to be called upon. But take little notice 
of it for I think to write a few lines perhaps. I 
fear I shall not be able to finde D. L's remonstrance, 
but will endevour it; for I am but just come from 
ye West of England to town, and my papers are j 
partly in town, and partly in Reading where in our 
way to Bristoll we sojourned 4 or 5 months, for 
our childrens sake at school. Tho I know not now the j 
use to be made of it here ; he being in such consid- j 
eration with some there. Pray give my love to J. N. |

Bristoll as well as here, but none to me, which I 
admire a little at. I admire thou hast not my orders !

fore. I writt two letters to thee on yt. acct. as also 
abt. Ch. Jones and Robert. . . My poor wife is

PARNASSUS

t 

By Christopher Morley 

"A good book," says Roger Mifflin in 
"Parnassus on Wheels," "like Eve, ought 
to come from somewhere near the third 
rib: there ought to be a heart vibrating in 
it." "Parnassus on Wheels" itself lives up 
to this requirement. We wager that this 
story of a travelling bookstore, its whimsi- 
cal, genial owner, and what happened when 
Helen McGill, spinster, took the egg 
money and bought the outfit, is one to cap- 
ture a good measure of popular fancy.

heart of every American," is the wish of Mr. 
Adolph ( irrmcr. national organizer of the United 
Mine Workers. The book pictures conditions of 
slavery and misery in the coal-mining camps of 
this country. 

Increasing attention has been given in recent 
years to the problems of the modern family, such 
as conditions of marriage, the birth rate, the wan- 
ing of home activities, the insurgency of the child, 
the economic independence of women, and divorce. 
Students of social conditions will be interested in 
"A Social History of the American Family from 
the Colonial Times to the Present," by Arthur W. 
Calhoun, the first volume of which is announced 
by the Arthur H. Clark Co. 

"Balfour, Viviani, and Joffre," just issued hy 
the Funk & Wagnalls Co., includes the speeches 
made here by those distinguished visitors, as well 
as the public utterances of the Italian, Belgian, 
and Russian commissioners, and an account of the 
arrival of our warships and soldiers in England 
and France under Admiral Sims and General 
Pershing. The material has been taken from con- 
temporary accounts and arranged by Francis W. 
Halsey, editor of "Great Epochs in American His- 
tory." 

"More Power to You" is a new book announced 
by the Century Co. from Bruce Barton, editor of 
"Every Week." When Mr. Barton, at the time 
a recent graduate of Amherst, departed from his 
first job in a Montana construction camp to take 
up journalism in Chicago, the foreman of the camp 
relieved himself of a prevailing American opinion : 
"Ain't you ashamed of yourself a big feller like 
you makin' your livin' with a little thing like a 
lead pencil ? Why you're big enough to swing a 
pick." 

D. Appleton & Co.'s fall list of fiction includes: 
"The Quest of Ledgar Dunstan," by Alfred Tre- 
sidder Sheppard, the story of a man's search for 
his soul; "The Broken Gate," by Emerson Hough, 
a story of the twofold moral law as it is applied 
to a man and a woman; "Cousin Julia," by Grace 
Hodgson Flandrau; "The Secret Witness." by 
George Gibbs, a war story based on "authentic 
data" given to the author by a well-known cor- 
respondent of the "London Times" in Vienna; 
"Treasure and Trouble Therewith," by Geraldine 
Bonner; "Alexis," by Stuart Maclean, a music- 
lover's story; "Miss Dulcic from Dixie." h\ I.nlah 
Ragsdalr; and "Christine, A Fife Fisher Girl," 
by Amelia E. Barr.

The first volume is an earnest

business methods in the house- 
hold. It is a simple, clear 
guide to economy, and every 
woman will find it helpful and 
inspiring. The second book is

"Justice has at last been granted 
an early American patriot. . . 
The subject of this detailed bi- 
ography was so close a friend

was poetically acclaimed 'Be-

he was an earnest apostle of 
preparedness, which should 
commend him to readers of to-

biography. It is a history of

The author explains lucidly t<> 
American readers the social 
themes treated by Brieux in his 
dramas and their relation to 
French Society. He considers 
the literary value and purpose 
of the plays, as well as the tes- 
timony of other writers concern-

SOME NEW McCLURG BOOKS 

THE DEVIL'S OWN by Randall Parrish 

The river gamblers of the old Mississippi steam boat days were as a class "bad men" in all 
that the term implies, and it is one of these picturesque rascals that gives the title to this 
latest yarn by one of the most popular story-tellers of his age. 

The time is at the outbreak of the Black Hawk War, which forms part of the background 
of the story. The movement is rapid throughout and the stirring adventures by forest and 
stream of the character are told in Parrish's own inimitable style. Illustrated by the Kin- 
neys. $1.40. 

THE VENGEANCE OF JEFFERSON GAWNE - by Charles Alden Seltzer 

A story of the Southwest, in the days of the big cattle ranges. It goes back to the time when 
the Gun was the court of final appeal, when men hated fiercely and loved with passionate ar- 
dor. It tells how the law came to a cow-town, dominated by a cattle thief and rustler, how 
one man, by sheer force of personality, succeeded in awakening that instinctive desire for law 
and order possessed individually and collectively by even crude communities. Illustrated by 
P. V. E. Ivory. $1.35. 

THE MESSIAH OF THE CYLINDER by Victor Rousseau 

A startingly original and powerful novel different from anything ever published. Mr. Rous- 
seau has his very vital characters play out their drama in a world gripped by a perverted 
and tyrannous socialism without either religion or freedom. A book that will be talked about. 
Pictures by J. C. Coll. Price $1.35. 

BY THE WORLD FORGOT by Cyrus Townsend Brady 

A romance beginning in New York and ending in the South Pacific. A scion of a prominent 
New York family, groom-to-be in a "marriage of convenience," is shanghaied aboard a sail- 
ing vessel by his business partner, who is in love with his prospective bride. The story of 
the unfortunate victim's awful experiences until and after he reaches a lonely island in the 
South Seas, inhabited by the descendants of some Dutch settlers, completely cut off from the 
rest of the world, and the finding there of his heart's desire in a maiden of the forgotten 
island, are highly absorbing, entertaining and exciting. Frontispiece by Clarence F. Under- 
wood. $1.40. 

A PRINCESS OF MARS by Edgar Rice Burroughs 

An absorbing tale of adventure and romance forty-three million miles from Earth. It is hardly 
too much to say it is the boldest piece of imaginative fiction in this generation. Only the man 
who created Tarzan, the Ape Man, could write so bold a story. Illustrated by Frank E. 
Schoonover. $1.35. 

A SON OF THE CITY by Herman Gastrell Seely 

A most realistic story and study of boy life, the perusal of which will give many a reader the 
feeling that he is living his own school days over again. 

John Fletcher and his chums are just boys, healthy young animals, irresponsible and carefree, 
preferring to play rather than study. Their pranks, escapades, physical encounters, battles on 
the playground, home life, and all the things which make boy life so interesting, are related 
in a way that has not been matched since Mark Twain wrote his immortal books of boy 
life. Illustrated by Fred J. Arting. $1.35. 

CUDDY'S BABY (New Edition) by Margaret Hill McCarter 

The spirit of the brave West, as tempered by the Prince of Peace, colors, and permeates 
every page of this wondrously beautiful human story; by a writer to whom is "given the rare 
talent of combining perfect literary art with intense emotional expression. Illustrated by J. 
Allen St. John. Oblong, flexible binding, boxed, 60 cents. In ooze calf, boxed, $1.50. 

TERSE VERSE by Walt Mason 

Humor that fairly sparkles, shrewd wisdom which one appreciates and assimilates, together 
with a rare knowledge and understanding of human nature, characterize the prose poems of 
this "Smiling philosopher with a gift of song," as he has been called. Illustrated and dec- 
orated. $1.30. In ooze calf, boxed, $1.75. 

GOLDEN SONGS OF THE GOLDEN STATE Compiled by Marguerite Wilkinson 

An anthology of poems that sing and celebrate the traditions, the life and the native beauty of 

one of the greatest commonwealths in the Union. 

The book was designed especially for gift purposes and so it is very pleasingly decorated. $1.50.

RUSSIAN MEMORIES 

By MADAM OLGA NOVIKOKF Net, $3.50 

English people give to Madam Novikoff much 
of the credit for the better feeling and the diplo- 
matic understanding between England and Russia 
that finally supplanted the ill feeling and suspicions 
of former years. Her book was written since the 
outbreak of the present war and is filled with anec- 
dotes and reminiscences of her long life. 

Honton Transcript says: "It is a sincere analysis 
of the relations between Russia and England as she 
has observed them during the last fifty years. And 
the personality shown in her writing is one of great 
intelligence and charm."

The DEVONSHIRE HOUSE CIRCLE 

Ky HUGH STOKES. Fully illustrated. Net. $6.00 
Devonshire House is the most historic palace in 
Mayfair. Its hospitable doors have opened to gen- 
eration after generation of English society and its 
passport is almost equal to a royal patent of nobil- 
ity. "The Devonshire House Circle" deals with the 
reign of the fifth Duke and his beautiful Duches*. 
the incomparable Georgina. The period covered is 
roughly the last quarter of the 18th Century. As a 
leader of London society the exploits of Georgina. 
Duchess of Devonshire, have never been rivalled. In 
this volume the courtyard in Piccadilly is once more 
crowded with the life and bustle of chariots, sedans, 
footmen, grandees and link-boys. 

RUSSIAN COURT MEMOIRS 

1914-1916 Net. $5.00 

The book, which affords a curious glimpse into 
Russian life, is written anonymously by a member 
of the court circle at Petrograd which was dashed 
from its high place by the Revolution. He is an 
ardent Russian, but as loyal to the tradition of 
royalty as to his country, and therefore the view ho 
gives of the former royal family and the members 
of the court circle is the other side of the shield 
from that which has usually been presented by 
Russian writers. 



Received the Prize of the Acadfmit Goncourt of Part* for the Beit Book of the Year 

UNDER FIRE (Le Feu} The Story of a Squad 

From the French of HENRI BARBUSSE .\V-/. $1.50 

The intimate story, written with masterly literary skill, of a French infantry squad. As he 
describes the daily life of the men the author turns inside out their minds and souls. 

Frank Moore Colby, in the Bookman for September, 1917, says: "There is much more than 
the life of a squad in this brilliant and varied narrative which records or divines wide areas 
of experience. . 

"It is not a chronicle, still less a diary, but combines pictures of men in masses, and of indi- 
vidual types, moralizings, impressions, observations, episodes, into a sort of epic of army life from 
the point of view of a private soldier."

HELEN OF FOUR GATES 

The author of this extraordinary "first book" is referred to as one of the most remarkable writers 
of recent years. 

A woman who has spent twenty of her thirty years in an English cotton mill has written a 

novel of such passion power and uncanny gripping quality that leading critics in England and 

America are comparing it to the fiction of Poe and the Bronte sisters. 

New York Times says: "An Ex-Mill girl has brought a new note to current fiction, a note that 

excels in sheer emotional power, in beauty of tone in imagination any voice that is now telling 

stories to the English speaking peoples." 

New York World says: "There are in print few pictures more impressive than those drawn by 

this unknown author."

15,000 to 20,000 feet. They spent the summers of

Plays by Alexander Ostrovsky 

A Protegee of the Mistress, Poverty Is No Crime, 
Sin and Sorrow Are Common to All, and It's a 
Family Affair. 

Translated from the Russian under the editorial 
supervision of GEORGE R. NOYES, Professor of 
Slavic Languages at the University of California. 
Ostrovsky is one of the most significant figures in 
Russian literature. He was a genuine originator, 
for he brought upon a stage that had previously 
dealt only with the nobility and the officials that 
great middle class of the merchant and the small 
landowner, which is so much more characteristically 
Russian, and so dealt with the realities of Russian 
life. The four plays in this volume are representa- 
tive. They combine to impress a curiously vivid 
sense of the Russian character. $1.50 net 

The Poems of H. C. Bunner 

"It is perhaps as a poet that the author of 'Airs 
of Arcady' is likely longest to be remembered ; and 
it is as a poet that he would have chosen to be 
cherished in men's memories. . . His verse has the 
form, the finish, the flavor of scholarship that the 
cultivated recognize and relish ; and it has also the 
freshness, the spontaneity, the heartiness, and the 
human sympathy, wanting which no poetry has ever 
been welcome outside the narrow circle of the dilet-

By GEORGE ALBERT COE, Professor in the

The thesis of the book is developed with the utmost

CALVARY ALLEY 

By Alice Hegan Rice 

Another story by the author of "Mrs. Wiggs 
of the Cabbage Patch," introducing a new 
group of her whimsical, lovable, surprising fic- 
tion people. The story tells of the growing up, 
the falling in love, the trials and the triumphs

cathedral which fronted on the grand and 
gorgeous avenue.

LADIES MUST LIVE 

By Alice Duer Miller 

By the author of "Come out of the Kitchen!" 
The novel is a sort of pirate story of New York 
high society. The incredibly clever cutting, 
thrusting, and manoeuvring of the beautiful 
pirates, in one of their classic contests for a 
rich and handsome man, the author reports 
with graphic clearness and dramatic intensity. 
8 full-page illustrations. $1.25 

MRS. HOPE'S HUSBAND 

By Gelett Burgess 

Before this novel went to press one of the 
best-known dramatists in America had begun 
making a play from the manuscript, for it is 
the liveliest comedy story an American author 
has produced in a long time. It is gay, witty, 
brilliant, swiftly moving. It is short, intense 
with suspense, bright with dialogue, and ends 
with a surprise that is a delight. It is a love 
story with no pompous purpose, and its method 
is the opposite of the detailed and tiresome.

conventional and thorough method of traveling and

trations are selections from several thousand photo- 
graphs taken by the author.

HEALTH FIRST 

By Henry D wight Chapin, M. D. 

This book is a sort of "first aid to the well." 
The author is one of the most eminent of New 
York physicians, for years a professor in the famous 
Post-Graduate Medical School and Hospital. 

"Health First" is not a new fad book on health, 
recommending freak treatments and strange foods fit 
only for cave-men. It is sublimated common sense 
from a great physician with years of experience in 
the kind of medical practice that we call "regular" ; 
and it is presented in a popular style, free from 
technicalities, extremely clear and interesting.

others, happier ?

of the internationalism which may develop in the 
future.

remarkable skill for summing up what men are thinking about.

the Jesus of history before the eyes of the twentieth century. The reading world owes Dr.

New Books of Immediate Interest and Permanent Value 

On the Edge of the War Zone 

From the Battle of the Marne to the Coming of the Stars and Stripes 

A Continuation of "A Hilltop on the Marne" 

By Mildred Aldrich 



Illustrated from photograph* 



$1.25 NET 



The long-awaited continuation to the same author's earlier book, "A Hilltop on the Marne." 
Like that volume, it is a collection of letters written to a friend in America. 

^Miss Aldrich went out to her hilltop in June, 1914, to enjoy a quiet life near her well-loved 
Paris; three months later "the miracle of the Marne" came to pass in sight of her very door, and 
there she still lives, after more than three years of extraordinarily interesting experiences in the war 
zone. 

Her earlier letters were published in "A Hilltop on the Marne." The new book takes up the 
narrative where the earlier book left it just after the Germans were flung back at the Marne and 
carries it to April 8, 1917 the date of the last letter when Miss Aldrich rejoices with all France 
a. the never-to-be-forgotten moment when the news came that the United States had entered the 
war.

The New Poets of France 



Although 1 am impatient to come to the 
contemporary poets, who give expression 
to the soul of the young men who are my 
comrades, I shall first review rapidly the 
recent past. It is indispensable to say 
from whom we descend, who were our 
elders and our masters. Another reason 
for calling attention to some important 
figures of the last period is that their value 
has not yet been fully recognized, and 
American readers will find an immense 
benefit in herborizing in this partly untrod- 
den garden. 

It is difficult for you to realize how little 
success depends upon merit, in France less 
than anywhere else. One explanation of 
this lies in the fact that talent being abun- 
dant, success could only consecrate it when 
it was joined with some social or commer- 
cial cleverness. But a better reason was 
the extreme division of the public into 
little classes who did not easily adopt one 
another's admirations; a man who was 
known and silently admired by the best 
might remain all his life unrecognized ex- 
cept by two hundred people, sometimes 
fewer. 

The consequence was that for a time 
the true artists refused to compete for 
popularity and made a system, a doctrine, 
of their isolation. Thus, instead of be- 
ing recognized after their death, like most 
of the great artists, they become known 
only after the passage of a generation of 
disciples. Now we can perceive rather 
clearly what were the characteristics of 
the best schools of 1890, which are to-day 
a part of France's classical past. First, 
they cared extremely for a perfect, orig- 
inal, rare form. They despised easy 
sources of inspiration. They looked for 
an art that was entirely sufficient to itself, 
that regarded life as ugly and poor. Art 
was a reaction against life and an evasion 
of it. A revenge against it. This is almost 
exactly the principle of Poe, for whom 
reality was poison; and it produced the 



perfectly pure and detached work of Mal- 
larme, among others. The result of that 
period was to leave some admirable 
poems, like "L'Apres-Midi d'un Faune" 
or Rimbaud's "Bateau Ivre," which are 
still the possession of but few admirers. 

Another result was the conquest of new 
forms in poetry. These poets did not ac- 
cept the formal laws of versification; they 
discovered and adopted new ones. And 
the new exigencies of modern verse are 
perhaps more strict than the old uniform 
rules of metre and rhyme. Free verse 
(the name is far from happy) introduced 
into poetry many possibilities and nuances 
that the regular Alexandrine verse did 
not afford. Irregular verse is of course 
nothing new, since it is said to have de- 
scended from La Fontaine and from the 
versets of the Bible. Now poetry is being 
appreciated according to the qualities of 
lyrism rather than to the degree of obedi- 
ence to fixed material rules. 

Let us rapidly recall to mind the names 
of Henri de Regnier and of Francis 
Viele-Griffin (who is an American by 
birth) as being the initiators of these re- 
forms. Jean Moreas stood faithful to 
strict metrical tradition. In the first rank 
of those who had influence and were fol- 
lowed by disciples, stands Francis Jammes, 
who has some of Virgil's blood running 
in his simple and harmonious poems. 

Comtesse Mathieu de Noailles has 
more pride and also more anxiety, but she 
is near to Jammes, whom she deeply ad- 
mires, in many aspects of her work. She 
is a great, noble, restless soul, with an 
extraordinary power of projecting mag- 
nificence around her. A decidedly power- 
ful influence on present French literature 
is Paul Claudel's. His genius is so strong 
and so new that a long preparation is nec- 
essary to approach and define him. Six 
years ago, he was known only to a few 
score. To-day he is famous. Other im- 
portant figures among these who were our

immediate elders are Paul Fort, author 
of the many "Ballades Francises," 
Andre Suares, Andre Spire, and Henri 
Gheon. Each of these deserves a long 
appreciation, which cannot find place here, 
but an enumeration of the influences acting 
upon us could not omit their names. 
Charles Peguy has a place among the 
poets, owing to his "Mysteres," the first 
being a deeply beautiful study of Joan of 
Arc's childhood and vocation. The two 
masters whose influence I regard as the 
most decisive on the inspiration and work 
of the young are Andre Gide and Emile 
Verhaeren. Them I shall but mention in 
this article, because I suppose them to be 
known already, and because their influ- 
ence on the artists I know has been so 
multiform and so subtle that it would be 
vain to try to indicate it in a rapid analysis. 
Readers must themselves open "Nourri- 
tures Terrestres," "La Porte Etroite," 
"Pretextes," "Nouveaux Pretextes," etc., 
and turn to the books of the great Belgian 
who died last year in so tragic a manner. 
French literature of to-day shows the 
marks of one American influence which 
may well be called decisive. Walt Whit- 
man's blood runs in the veins of the young 
writers of France. We first knew "Leaves 
of Grass" in the translation of Leon 
Bazalgette, which was published in the 
"Mercure de France"; then we read it 
in English. Shall I call our young poets 
disciples of his? Whitman would smile 
at this. The old master, whom they never 
saw but can imagine, never cared for dis- 
ciples in the narrow sense of that word. 
Maybe they know little of him and mis- 
understand him still they understand him 
well enough not to call themselves dis- 
ciples ! Some of our writers used a verse 
very similar to his. But his influence on 
a few poets is little compared with his 
influence on the mentality of the young 
in general. It is more vital than the dis- 
covery of a new resource in rhythm or in 
melody. It is a matter of immensely re- 
newed inspiration that is one of the 
treasures of our times. His voice and 
Verhaeren's answer each other, as did 
Columbia's star and France's in the poem 
written in 1871 by your prophet of 
Democracy. I remember the word of 



Alphonse Daudet's little son when he 
saw Ivan 1 ur^etu-v coming into his fa- 
ther's house, arm in arm with Gusta\e 
Flaubert: "But all your friends are 
giants, then?" 

These giants who dictate the rhythm of 
our literary life have opened to the 
world's poetry a new field; and what a 
field! That of modern life. They sang 
of the cities and the industrial work and 
the physical effort. Their teaching is the 
one that will be demanded by the men 
returned from the war a teaching of 
strength, fervor, and simplicity. But we 
did not wait for the war to read and 
admire them. The universe seems to be 
wider since their voices praised its vari- 
ous parts, countries, creatures, construc- 
tions, details. . . We are no more t lu- 
men we were before we read "Song of 
Myself." 

Let me quote from one of the best 
poems of Charles Vildrac's "Livre 
d' Amour" (Nouvelle Revue Franchise) 
as translated by Miss Elizabeth Eyre : 

The Conquerors. 

Behold the cavalier without a horse, hut 
whoever sees him pass will know him for a Knight 

Behold the pilgrim with neither staff nor brevi- 
ary, but whoever sees him pass will know that 
he is more than a crusader 

Behold the chief who does not command, but 
whoever listens to him will know him for a captain. 

Behold the conqueror without an army, but the 
only conqueror he who knows how to talk with 
everybody, both men and women ; and can make 
good tears shine in their eyes again, and can give 
back to them the clear laughter of children. 

His best weapons are his friendly eyes, his 
thoughtful and surprising kindnesses, it is the wa\ 
his voice gives help to his words, it is the way his 
spirit dances like a torch. 



He is prodigal and bare as a tree in the spring, 
his heart is warm as a greenhouse in winter; and 
one abandons oneself to whatever he says, again 
it is he who. when he takes, gives. 

He will come wherever you are. He will not sit 
down beside you as do those to whom the half of 
your face and but one of your shoulders are enough. 

But he will sit down opposite you, his knees 
touching your knees, your hands within reach 
of his hands, and his eyes bearing upon your < 
forcing them to uncover. 

And you will say: Where have I seen him before? 

As in singing under a vault one discovers the 
single note which makes the whole vibrate and 
become its warm voice. 

So his words agitate in your lifted throat the 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



259 



beautiful voice that it imprisons, of which you had 
no suspicion, your best voice, your only voice. 

He will love you in your own way, with the 
presents you would have chosen, with his bluntness, 
with his laughter, his humility or his pity; he will 
love you as much as it is necessary to soften you 
and win you. 

You will wonder: What does he expect from 
me? What will he ask of me to-morrow? And 
you will be troubled, never suspecting that really, 
without knowing it himself, he expects from you 
the reason for his existence; that you are neces- 
sary to him as the words one speaks, the ears 
that receive them, as beautiful things to the eyes 
that surround them. 

For conquest is his great desire; like heroes and 
like women, he loves to feel himself fondled by 
the scattered thoughts of men, which, from a great 
distance, lean towards him as benumbed fingers 
stretch towards a fire. 



Or our cities will remain in ashes, and our dead 
unburied! 



We find ourselves at the edge of the fresh ridge 
The seed that we hold is very different 



And then will other conquerors unexpectedly 
arise, and as there have been a hundred con- 
querors, so now must one become a hundred times 
a lover, a hundred times beloved. 

. . . And those that have been conquered a 
hundred times will also turn to conquer. 

And the time will come in the country, the time 
of the great conquest, when people with this long- 
ing will leave the thresholds of their doors, to go 
the one to meet the other. 

And the time will come in this country, when 
history will be made of nothing but choruses of 
songs, but dances hand in hand, but one combat 
and one victory! 

Vildrac belongs to the group of the Unani- 
mists, whose chief was Jules Remains. 
They looked for inspiration not so much 
in individual feelings and passions, as in 
the life and movement of collectivities. 
In "La Vie Unanime," by Romains (Mer- 
cure de France), we find verses which 
perhaps most absolutely formulate this 
creed. I wish to quote a fragment of an 
unpublished chant "To America," which 
was written in 1917 by a very young poet, 
Mireille Havet: 

Glorious cities of America, 

Tumultuous cities, and well populated, 

Cities rich with the future which will cover us all, 

I salute you, to-day, from my little corner in France, 

From my corner of a city in France, 

From the corner of mv table. 



Ah, never was it graver to be young 

Graver to be impatient 

With that conquering desire which comes from 

the pride to be the last ones 

. . . The last of all, when the others were living 
. . . The first, now that we are alone ! 
And the words shall come from us 
Or eternally remain silent 
And judgment shall come from us, and action, 



America, let our generation be the piers of a bridge 
Stretching itself between the various nations. 
Let our hands grasp each other 
Let us stand firm 

And be worthy of this Earth, which men, until now, 
Did but divide between themselves in a bloody 
fashion. 

I salute you, well-populated cities of America, 
And my heart goes to you 
Leaping with hope. 

There are many names which I would 
give: Saintleger Leger, who wrote the 
strange and splendid "Eloges" ; Leon-Paul 
Fargue, whose power over words is magic; 
Rene Arcos; Frangois Porche with "Le 
Dessous du Masque"; Georges Duhamel 
with several books of poems and dramas, 
these are among the chief figures of our 
time. But let me turn to Henri Franck, 
who died at 23, before the war, leaving 
that long, unfinished poem, "La Danse 
devant TArche," and who would lead our 
troop to-day if he was still among us. The 
first part of the poem ended with this 
affirmation of enthusiasm before the Uni- 
verse. I quote from a translation by Miss 
Virginia Hale: 

Adolescent runner with unwearied heart 

I shall reach the clearing where one comes upon 

God. 

One day I shall know the thing I so strongly desire, 
And my spirit will be multiplied and stretched 

with the waiting; 

For nothing exists in earth or heaven 
That the determination of my seeking wisdom may 

not know. 

One day I shall find the divine current, 
And with the feel of its powerful flow against my 

back, 
A joyous bather abandoning myself to the sweep 

of the stream, 
On this glorious bed, between the superb banks of 

the Universe laden with houses and fruits. 
Supple of body, light of heart, swift of spirit, 
In the turbulent water of life I shall swim with 

power and pleasure. 

And in the last part, reaching a higher 
point of knowledge and wisdom, without 
losing his power or fervor, he can say: 

Truth is enthusiasm without hope, 
Ardor unquenchable, 

Joy that mounts straight up into the black sky. 
The perfect happiness of fervour without recom- 
pense, 



260 



Till-: DIAL 



[Septemlv 



The high happiness of feeling keenly one's existence, 
Of being alive! 

The fragments I have chosen to quote 
are not the most perfect I could have 
found, but the ones which seemed to me 
to give the sense of our next tendencies in 
poetry; and I find many of the same char- 
acteristics in the living American poets 
whom I read. There is no reason why 
France should not give cordial recogni- 
tion to poets like E. L. Masters, E. A. 
Robinson, Miss Lowell, Vachel Lindsay, 
Witter Bynner, Ridgely Torrence, and 
others. I am strangely impatient to see 



the dav when I shall try to give to a few 
in 1'aris an idea of the movement and 
rluthm of "The Congo" or "(Jcncral 
Booth," by Vachel Lindsay. Lindsa\\ 
muse essentially belongs to Springfield, 
Illinois, and knows no other snores, but 
that is precisely why we shall be glad to 
welcome her, with her bright cheeks and 
well-knit muscles and her surprise to find 
herself among us. This is not mere curi- 
osity or dilettantism. What we really love 
will become a part of us, as Poe and 
Whitman did in the past. 

PIERRE DE LAM \ 



Henry James: A Rhapsody of Youth 



I have wondered how it feels to "have 
read Henry James for the last twenty-five 
years." During the short time I have 
been reading him I have seen critiques, 
favorable and otherwise, that have ap- 
peared about him, contributed I suppose 
by those superior souls who "have read 
him for the last twenty-five years." None 
of them states the point of view of youth 
fresh in the experience of knowing Henry 
James, and I propose therefore to say 
what is in my heart of his books by way 
of variety, to express one or two of the 
primitive motifs of the rhapsody which 
has been strumming in my mind. 

One afternoon (I was in college at the 
time) I was listening to the talk of a so- 
cial dowager, who said, to point a bit of 
gossip, that a certain girl whom T knew 
was a "type of American like Daisy Mil- 
ler." Within the week I read "Daisy 
Miller." That was my first experience 
reading James. Since then I have read 
him much; and I find that his people are 
so real to me, so sentiently or so spiritually 
alive, that in writing about them I am 
bound to speak of them as one speaks of 
the living of those who can answer our 
criticism, or be embarrassed by our praise. 

I had not gone far into "Daisy Miller" 
before the girl herself was clearly visible 
before me, a picture of American grace 
and loveliness. I had recently been to Eu- 
rope and this experience furnished me a 
lens through which to view with greater 
clearness her effervescent, ardent person- 
ality, suffused with the radiant sunshine of 



the Roman atmosphere. Very soon I 
sensed an inappropriateness in the fusion; 
felt how it was loaded with tragedy from 
the beginning. I wondered what James 
would do; I felt there was nothing one 
could do to save Daisy Miller from her- 
self and her mother. A lurking feeling 
whispered the author would find a \vav. 
Reflection came afterward, and ration- 
ality, arguing that an artist finds in his art 
a stinging moral whip; and that, as leader 
of the Opposition, he cannot belie his con- 
science. Thus torn between impatience 
that things should be so, and exasperation 
at James's cold impersonality in present- 
ing the situation, I read through the story. 
And when Daisy Miller was dead; when 
I could reflect, I knew that underlying 
James's artistic impersonality was a 
strongly diffusive element of morality: 
that, although he was thoroughly an art- 
ist, whether or not he intended he had re- 
vealed a delicate New Englander's ideal 
of moral beauty. 

I finished the book in the .evening at the 
library. I confess I had been weeping. 
I was sadly depressed about Daisy Miller, 
and all simple, inexperienced American 
girls with trainings which equipped them 
to meet only American men with safety, 
and with fools for mothers. I decided to 
walk, and not go home to dinner. I was 
in no mood to meet the raillery of a crowd 
of undergraduate students. 

With reverence I felt I had come upon 
a great writer. Here was a man who 
viewed a shallow countrywoman, saw

through her glaring, superficial faults into 
the depths of her very soul, where he 
found, if not pure gold, at least very beau- 
tifully colored pebbles, and sparkling, 
variegated sands. By the magic of his 
imagination he presented her faithfully, 
vividly, for the reader. Indeed it was be- 
cause he looked at her, into her, and all 
around her that he could write the truth; 
but to write the truth with added touches 
of beauty that I thought was the marvel- 
ous performance. Daisy Miller, reveal- 
ing as she did the crude manners of the 
nouveau riche, was portrayed as a very 
much alive, beautiful, and in her way aspir- 
ing girl ; she reflected in spite of her sorry 
social trappings a soul pure, frank, good, 
delightful. These were the values which 
interested me, which carried me away 
from the present, from myself, and let 
me see only one set of immediate circum- 
stances Daisy Miller's fatal stepping 
through a social fog over a parapet to 
inevitable destruction. 

There, James seemed to say, after the 
story had been written, that is life. Look 
at it carefully; in this particular case view 
it with sympathy; but let us never be the 
least bit sentimental about it. I grant that 
it is tragedy; but there you are. 

I was deeply impressed. Life, which 
had seemed troubled to me before, was, if 
anything, more troubled. And yet from 
that experience came a thoughtful fatal- 
ism which transferred me from the excited 
individuals who were seeing life, not at 
all steadily, but much as one sees his fel- 
low-passengers on a ship in a rough gale 
over to the quieter people who, in spite 
of their apparent indifference, were nev- 
ertheless more profound, more subtle, 
more human than their stormy-souled 
brethren who were charging up and down 
the field of life. Henry James became 
for me par excellence one of these quieter 
souls. There was a new vista, really; and 
if there were quiet fields and peaceful 
scenes, and apparently superficial people 
who dared to criticize life (without 
oh unpardonable interference ! "giving 
something in return for that which they 
took away"), there was, I found, a keener 
criticism, a better charity, a wider knowl- 
edge of the world's humanity. 



I did not read James again for a long 
time, until a "charter Jacobite" friend 
asked me to read "The Portrait of a 
Lady" ; writing that she considered Isabel 
Archer's one of the most poignant spirit- 
ual histories in all literature, and Ralph 
Touchett the most interesting man in fic- 
tion. With extra enthusiasm I began the 
book. But alas, after fifty pages I put it 
down. I looked upon myself reproach- 
fully, but I couldn't go on. I wasn't intol- 
erant; I was impervious. Thus I looked 
at the book for a year, until at length, 
piqued by defeat, I began again. This 
time it was all very different. I had ar- 
ranged my reading finally so as to "save" 
the book so many pages before going to 
sleep. 

There was a breath in the story of spir- 
itual adventure, of eternal discovery in 
characters complex and unfathomable, 
which gave the book its charm for me, 
and made the reading my daily reparation. 
Ralph Touchett grew to be a friend. That 
is, I attached him. I should have told 
him the sacredest things of my life. I had 
the vivifying sensation that he would have 
responded to my affection, that it would 
have been mutual. But this is both debat- 
able and personal. Touchett is the kind 
of man to whom the phrase "a fine fel- 
low" (ordinarily so vapid in meaning) in 
its proper signification most fittingly ap- 
plies. He is genial, tolerant, high-minded. 

I was captivated by Isabel from the mo- 
ment I found her sitting in the gloomy 
library of her father's Albany house. I 
watched her with keen interest, with pleas- 
ure, eventually with amazement. For I 
saw into the deep, the covered life of a 
woman the essence which is usually 
hidden from vulgar inspection and I was 
fascinated. It was so evident that I 
scarcely needed to be told that "Suffering, 
with Isabel, was an active condition; it 
was not a chill, a stupor, a despair, it was 
a passion of thought, of speculation, of 
response to every pressure." I felt sorry 
for Isabel, but I did not dare to pity her. 

At each spiritual revelation in her hard 
experience I was as shocked as Isabel her- 
self; I felt painfully embarrassed to find 
myself seeing her given first one torturing 
stab and then another. In imagination I

left, stealthily, without letting her know 
I had been a witness. To see her soul in 
pain was more than I could bear at times. 
I felt toward Isabel at the next meeting 
exactly as I should feel in actual life; that 
I knew her better and was therefore priv- 
ileged, regardless of my embarrassment, 
to apprise her of my attitude of deeper 
affection and sympathy with as little ex- 
hibition of feeling as possible not at all 
if I couldn't manage it without being 
clumsy. The pity of it all was that I could 
do absolutely nothing to relieve her life 
of a part of its bitterness. Her pride 
closed all avenues through which sympa- 
thetic offerings might travel. It was ter- 
rible. I could only say again and again 
to myself: that is life. 

The tragedy of Isabel's condition was 
awful because her "crime" consisted, 
James says, of this: "She had a certain 
way of looking at life which he [Osmond, 
her husband] took as a personal offence." 
Saddest of all because there is a touch 
of the heroic about it was the fact that 
her way of looking at life was the fine, the 
just, the moral way. Isabel "could see 
that he was ineffably ashamed of her . . . 
she simply believed that he hated her . . . 
he was not violent," and so "of course it 
was not a physical suffering; for physical 
suffering there might have been a remedy." 

Finally Isabel meets her spiritual crisis 
the peak of her load; she is called to 
England to see Ralph Touchett, her 
cousin, who is dying. I suffered until 
I knew whether .she would go ; and when 
she told Osmond her news, and the cruel 
devil, with measured meanness, spoke to 
her as if she had been ignoble, I trem- 
bled. But I had to listen while he spewed 
forth venomous words from his poison- 
ous, egotistical character. At length Is- 
abel left the room; she had not said 
she would not go; I felt a vicarious ela- 
tion at her spiritual victory. I wanted 
to get her out of the house away from 
further indignity and affront; to start her 
for London hoping, praying she would 
never come back to Italy. 

From the very first, though, there was 
a vague impression of Isabel's soul which 
terrified me with the conviction that she 
would return to that life almost more 



unendurable than death. And when slu- 
did return, after Ralph's death giving 
up happiness for an idea I who had been 
carried to a climax of anxiety, felt myself 
dashed by her inevitable action to a help- 
less, inert will. I could only murmur: 
There is nothing I can do; there you are! 
I nun these "growing pains of a Jacob- 
ite" I suffer more than my accusers. When 
one has thought deeply about, has felt in- 
tensely with, Ralph Touchett, with Chris- 
topher Newman, with Strether (especially 
with Strether), there is opened a reser- 
voir of enthusiasm from which the ten- 
dency is to pour forth streams of 
volubility. But this kind of speaking is 
dangerous; its current should be directed 
through the channels of artists no less 
skilful, really, than Henry James himself. 
Masters are very hard to find, however; 
and it is quite as true of letters as of life 
that "what the great will do the less will 
prattle of." JOHN \ BIKRI.LL.

The Mind of Germany 

HURRAH AND HALLELUJAH. The Teaching of 
Germany's Poets, Prophets, and Preachers. A 
Documentation by T. P. Bang. Translated from 
the Danish by Jessie Brochner. (George H. 
Doran Co.; $1.) 

GEMS(?) OF GERMAN THOUGHT. Compiled by 
William Archer. (Doubleday, Page & Co.; 
$1.25.) 

"Hurrah and Hallelujah" is the name of a 
book of war poems from the inspired pen of a Ger- 
man pastor, Konsistorialrat Dietrich Vorwerk. 
"I find," says Dr. Bang, who is a Danish clergy- 
man of distinction and good sense, "in this com- 
bination something so absolutely characteristic of 
the German spirit that I have adopted it as the 
title for this book." No one, however, who reads 
the book can be satisfied with the title. The ex- 
cerpts, citations, and summaries of which it 
consists suggest something more intense than 
"hurrah" and more sinister than "hallelujah." 
For "hurrah" goes with exuberant vitality, grat- 
ulatory good will, a certain openness of spirit, 
and a certain tolerance. "Hallelujah" utters, at 
worst, the piety of the Salvation Army. But the 
feeling for which "hurrah" stands here is not 
exuberant vitality, nor good will, nor openness, 
nor tolerance ; it is fierce passion, persecuting mis- 
sionary passion, grandiose, egomaniac, blind. The 
feeling for which "hallelujah" stands is not piety, 
not gladness in the bounty of God ; it is the iden- 
tification of German being with divine being, of 
German purpose with divine purpose, the glori- 
fication not of God, but of Germany. The mild- 
est statement of "Hurrah and Hallelujah" is the 
oft-quoted couplet by Geibel: 

Und es mag am deutschen Wesen 
Einmal noch die Welt genesen. 

With this sentiment of grandeur goes another 
feeling, which seems to be its complement, but 
which "hurrah" and "hallelujah" do not sug- 
gest at all. This other feeling is of persecution 
by unworthy enemies, enemies who not only 
cause but are the disease of the world, and as 
such must be extirpated by the healing might of 
Germany England the jealous and hypocrit- 
ical, France the degenerate, Russia the barbarous, 
all to be purified by German force and healed by 
German Kultur. Thus: 

HURRAH AND HALLELUJAH 

Though the warrior's bread be scanty, do Thou 
work daily death and tenfold woe unto the enemy. 
Forgive in merciful long-suffering each bullet and 
each blow which misses its mark! Lead us not into 
the temptation of letting our wrath be too tame in 
carrying out Thy divine judgment! Deliver us and 
our Ally from the infernal Enemy and his servants 



on earth. Thine is the kingdom, the German land ; 
may we, by aid of Thy steel-clad hand, achieve the 
power and the glory. 

Thou who dwellest high above Cherubim, Seraphim 
and Zeppelins in Thy Heaven, Thou who art en- 
throned as a God of thunder in the midst of light- 
ning from the clouds, and lightning from sword and 
cannon, send thunder, lightning, hail and tempest 
hurtling upon our enemy, bestow upon us his banners, 
hurl him down into the dark burial-pits. Dietrich 
Vorwerk, "Hurrah and Hallelujah." 

But the deepest and most thought-inspiring result 
of the war is the "German God." Not the national 
God, such as the lower nations worship, but "our 
God," who is not ashamed of belonging to us, the pe- 
culiar acquirement of our heart. Max Lenz has al- 
ready testified to the revelation of the "German God" 
and Luther's hymn, "Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott," 
merely expresses the same idea in other words. Re- 
port of an address by a German theological professor, 
in the Berliner "Lokalanzeiger." 

We could draw many instructive parallels; we 
could say that as Jesus was treated, so also have the 
German people been treated. 

They envy us our freedom, our power to do our 
work in peace, to excel in virtue of ability, to fulfil 
our appointed task for the good of the world and 
humanity, to heal the world by the German nature, 
to become a blessing to the people of the earth. Wher- 
ever the German spirit obtains supremacy, there free- 
dom also prevails. And have not our enemies to fall 
back upon lies and venomous calumnies in the en- 
deavor to justify their assault in the world's eyes and 
their own ? Does this not prove that the truth, too, is 
with us? Truth and freedom, those two great bless- 
ings, are in our Gospel promised by the Lord Him- 
self. 

Here we come upon the old intimate kinship be- 
tween the essence of Christianity and of Germanism. 
Because of their close spiritual relationship, therefore, 
Christianity must find its fairest flower in the German 
mind. H. Francke, a pastor in Liegnitz. 

My friends, when England, "Christian" England, 
akin to us in blood, was so shameless in her naked 
egoism, that she by her declaration of war would 
rather hand us over to Muscovites and semi-Asiatics 
than contend with us, in honest peaceful rivalry, for 
the palm of Kultur, it struck a hard blow to our soul, 
and all our wrath and pride rose up against this de- 
generate cousin. . . London is the hearth and the heart 
of this terrible world-war, there sit the ministers who 
have precipitated Europe into misery, there is the 
witch's caldron, in which fresh misery is ever brew- 
ing for the peoples of Europe, already bleeding from 
a thousand wounds. To attack London is to attack a 
den of murderers. Karl Konig, "Six War Sermons." 

Against us stands the world's greatest sham of a 
nation, whom, with German good nature, we have 
much too long called the "English cousin," the Car- 
thaginians of the North Sea, in whom we trusted 
that blood would have proved thicker than water: 
the Judas among the nations, who this time, for a 
change, betrays Germanism for thirty pieces of silver. 
Against us stands sensual France, the harlot amongst 
the peoples (die Dime unter den Volkern), to be 
bought for any prurient excitement, shameless, un- 
blushing, impudent, and cowardly ( !), with her worth- 
less myrmidons. Against us stands Russia, inwardly, 
indeed, rotten, mouldering, masking its diseases under 
outbursts of brutality, but capable of employing any 
means, devoid of all feeling not dangerous of her- 
self, but becoming a menace when leagued with oth- 
ers, like a beast raging from the fever of wounds, 
deceitful, never to be trusted. 

The great thing is therefore for us to stand, so that

Javr(I). pastor Joh. Rump, lie. Dr., of Berlin. 

GEMS (?) OF GERMAN THOUGHT 

It has been said that it is un-Gerraan to wish to be 
only German. That again is a consequence of our 
spiritual wealth. We understand all foreign nations; 
none of them understands us, and none of them can 
understand us. 

No nation in the world can give us anything worth 
mentioning in the field of science or technology, art 
or literature, which we would have any trouble in 
doing without. Let us reflect on the inexhaustible 
wealth of the German character, which contains in 
itself everything of real value that the Kultur of man 
can produce. Professor W. Sombart, H. U. H. 

The efforts directed towards the abolition of war 
must not only be termed foolish, but absolutely im- 
moral, and must be stigmatized as unworthy of the 
human race. . . The weak nation is to have the same 
right to live as the powerful and vigorous nation! 
The whole idea represents a presumptuous encroach- 
ment on the natural laws of development. General 
v. Bernhardi, G. N. W. 

Our German Kultur has, in its unique depth, some- 
thing shrinking and severe (Sfrodes and Herbes), it 
does not obtrude itself, or readily yield itself up; it 
must be earnestly sought after and lovingly assimi- 
lated from within. This love was lacking in our 
neighbors; wherefore they easily came to look upon 
us with the eyes of hatred. Professor R. Eucken, I. M. 

We desire, and must desire ... a world-empire of 
Teutonic (germanisch) stock, under the hegemony of 
the German people. In order to secure this we must 

(a) Gradually Germanize the Scandinavian and 
Dutch Teutonic States, denationalizing them in the 
weaker signification of the term. 

(b) Break up the predominantly un-Teutonic peo- 
ples into their component parts, in order to take to 
ourselves the Teutonic element and Germanize it, 
while we reject the un-Teutonic element. J. L. 
Reimer, E. P. D. 

If our area of colonization does not coincide with 
our political boundaries, the healthy egoism of our 
race commands us to place our frontier-posts in for- 
eign territory, as we have done at Metz. Professor 
E. Hasse, D. G. 

The sentiment of grandeur and the sentiment 
of persecution are as these quotations, chosen 
practically at random, show the ruling passions 
in the material of both Dr. Bang's and Mr. Arch- 
er's books. I have spoken of Dr. Bang's only, be- 
cause Mr. Archer's has in its title a very obvious 
and natural animus. His quotations, however, 
are more than confirmed even by the material 
Dr. Bang handles with such courteous objectivity. 

But Dr. Bang's book possesses a significance 
which Mr. Archer's does not, because it devotes 
itself so largely to the sermons of the clergy. 
The sermon, particularly in those countries which 
boast established churches, is the last entrench- 
ment of the commonplace. Of all the non-pro- 



ducing classes, the clergy are the most admirably 
passive and inert. For this state their preoccu- 
pation with the infallibilities of religion is partly 
responsible, but only partly. A non-producing 
class obviously must reenforce the sources of its 
living if it is to go on living: doctrine, conse- 
quently, which appears in sermons is doctrine 
become completely commonplace, doctrine ac- 
cepted and acceptable. Sermons, hence, are pos- 
sessed of evidentiality which cannot accrue to 
philosophies like Nietzsche's, or histories like 
Treitschke's, or rcal-politik like Bernhardi's. 
The sermons of a people utter the set mind of a 
people. 

We have, then, in these citations, the mind of 
Germany. Prior to and until the time of their 
collection, it had been an unusually single mind, 
with the inflexibility of outlook and of feeling 
that is associated with abnormality. Indeed, the 
two sentiments of which it is conspicuously com- 
posed define, in the individual, what is known 
as paranoia, and men and women who suffer 
from paranoia are classed among the criminally 
insane. The disease is incurable. 

But that a whole people should bear the stig- 
mata of an incurable criminality is, of course, 
absurd. That Germany was not always so, that 
there is a Germany of gemiithlichkeit, learning, 
science, poetry, and democratic aspiration, and 
that that Germany is the original and lasting 
Germany, everybody whom the war has not 
turned paranoiac on his own account, will not 
only concede but assert. If the President's words 
are to be taken at their face value, it is for the 
sake of this Germany, which so many of us 
Americans have known and loved and received 
benefits from, no less than for the sake of Bel- 
gium and Serbia and the other small nationali- 
ties, that we are trying to "make the world safe 
for democracy" by force of arms. Forty years 
this Germany has been repressed. The social 
history of Germany during these forty years may 
be summed up in the word verboten. And pro- 
hibitions were not only impersonal and lepal ; 
they were personal and social. The spontanei- 
ties of men were forced under on all sides; an 
omnipresent and thoroughgoing police system 
held them down in the daily life of labor and 
citizenship; an equally omnipresent and arrogant 
military and land-holding caste clamped them 
down in the daily life of personal contacts and 
social play. Precedence and etiquette replaced 
friendliness and good manners. Resentments ac- 
cumulated, but could not be expressed. 



1917] 



THE; DIAL 



265 



The life of the German people began to alter. 
The repressed spontaneities had to find some out- 
let; the accumulated resentments clamored for 
utterance. The life and letters of Germany, with 
her stupendous number of children suicides, her 
barbarous attitude toward women, her misprision 
of the foreigner, her elaboration of eroticism, 
and her worship of the superman, are the effect. 
Resentment that you could not express against 
your "betters," you vented upon your "inferi- 
ors"; spontaneities you could not use in free cre- 
ative action in your communities of friends you 
gratified by compensatory formulations in your 
art and your philosophy. As the pressure of the 
militaristic machinery grew heavier, this became 
more and more the case. The tribalism of 
Treitschke, the ruthlessness of Nietzsche, the 
imperialism of Bernhardi, became compensatory 
liberations in idea for restrictions and repressions 
in fact. Furthermore, the engine of repression, 
the State, with the Kaiser and his staff as it's 
symbol, was a thing, after all, not completely 
alien. There took place, consequently, a change 
in the German mind which the psychologists call 
"projection." By this change repressive instru- 
ments are often made identical with the things 
they repress. The gods, for example, are pro- 
jections of this sort ; they stand both for all that 
man has the inner wish to be and for the circum- 
stances that do not permit the being ; they do and 
enjoy all things that man might and would if 
he could. The State became the god of Ger- 
many. What in countries with free institutions, 
like England, or France, or the United States, 
the individual might achieve in himself was pro- 
jected upon the State, through which he thus ex- 
ercised his spontaneous powers vicariously. On 
the other hand, the evil that the State wrought 
was projected outward, to the enemies of the 
State and England and France particularly 
were credited with motives as surprising to them 
as the world's judgment of Germany is unin- 
telligible to Germans. When, furthermore, the 
rulers of Germany proceeded to turn these com- 
pensatory sentiments into the dynamic of their 
political programme, the war, with its atrocities, 
mendaciousness, and unintelligence, became in- 
evitable. 

How far the German people have been disillu- 
sioned in the course of it, no one can say. So 
much, however, is certain. The President's de- 
mand for internal changes as a preliminary con- 
dition for the discussion of peace, is absolutely 
sound. The restoration of Germany to mental 



health and the possibility of the German achieve- 
ment of whatever mission the Germans may 
claim, rests simply and entirely on the elimina- 
tion of the agency of repression that has so 
distorted the mind of Germany. The real Ger- 
many is democratic Germany, the Germany of 
the free individual. It exists, although it exists 
in the shadow. Freedom will show it clear. 
Until Germany has been democratized, terms of 
peace are scraps of paper, and for the same reason 
that agreements with abnormal individuals are 
scraps of paper. R> M> KALLEN-

WHITE NIGHTS. By Arthur Ruhl. (Charles 
Scribner's Sons; $2.) 

In the old days, and perhaps the custom is 
still extant, parents were in the habit of apply- 
ing to their refractory offspring the hard and 
chastening rod, and with each application they 
would assure the prostrate but incredulous 
youngsters that the beating hurt them, the par- 
ents, more than it did the children and that it 
was for the good of the youthful soul. In the 
old days, too, men were piously burned and tor- 
tured for the good of their souls. And so pow- 
erful is the effect of repetition, in manners as 
well as in studies, that, at one period in the 
evolution of civilization, men of saintly character 
became firmly convinced that the royal road to 
salvation led through the trials of martyrdom. 

Some of us, in these days of grace, have come 
to doubt the efficacy of the rod and the regener- 
ating power of suffering. The Diabolonian spirit 
is abroad. Patience and long-suffering have be- 
come cardinal vices and lead straight away from 
heaven. Men who, not many years ago, experi- 
enced the knout in dumb resignation have grown 
so proud that they refuse to bear a coddling 
bureaucracy. And strange to say, they find in 
these rejections the road to salvation. They rebel 
in the name of idealism, of regeneration, of a 
finer, truer life; they have not changed their 
faith or transferred their loyalty. Theirs is the 
old hope of man, reborn. Some call them rebels, 
but they are unwavering in their allegiance. 

The Russians as a people have long been 
known for their humility and submissiveness 
(smirenie) and for their forbearance and long- 
suffering (dolffoterpenie). Dostoevsky rejoiced

and unworldly strain in the Russians. For him 
Holy Russia is a living fact, as he himself says. 
He fears that Russia will some day become "a 
non-Christian democracy like France." And in 
one place he writes: 

If Russia were merely Sturmer, Protopopof, Gorky, 
Rubenstein (the finance manipulator), Reinbot (who 
organized the police graft in Moscow), Rasputin (the 
debauched Siberian), Sukhomlinof (who is at rest in 
the fortress of Peter and Paul), Masoyedof (who 
was hanged for betraying Russia), Azef, Milyukof, 
Kerensky, Count Benckendorf, etc., etc., how little 
interest she would have for us! 

Heaven protect a people from those who love 
them for being rather interesting! It is so diffi- 
cult to be heroic, odd, mediaeval, and bizarre in 
this workaday world. And all to please the fancy 
of a few alien pilgrims who seek the balm of 
Gilead in a crass and material age! 

Mr. Graham's book, a volume of short 
sketches, was written before the Revolution. 
To-day one can believe whole-heartedly in Holy 
Russia as a living fact. Freedom will make Rus- 
sia holy, as many Russians and lovers of Russia 
knew all along. There is no mistaking the out- 
spoken desire of the people to found a Christian 
democracy. The high, spiritual feat (podvig) 
of patience, love, and prayer will still be dearer 
to the Russian heart than the podvlg of battle 
and struggle. But, for the complete liturgy of 
life, battle and struggle cannot be renounced. 

Fascinating glimpses of Russia on the eve of 
revolution are given in Mr. Ruhl's delightful 
work, "White Nights." Mr. Ruhl is perhaps 
the best equipped, in sympathetic understanding, 
charm of style, and intellectual preparation, of 
the American journalists now in Russia. These 
things far outvalue knowledge of the language. 
The writer takes us with him on his journey to 
Russia, stopping on the way to introduce us to 
Ellen Key, then on to the white nights of Petro- 
grad, and from there to the turmoil of the war 
on the Russian battle front. We return inland, 
to Moscow, and are initiated into the mysteries 
of the Moscow Art Theatre. Hastening back 
to Petrograd we visit the Taurida Palace, where 
the Duma sat, and we meet the prominent depu- 
ties, some of whom have since become world 
figures. The final stages of the pleasant journey 
of discovery take the reader down Gorky's river, 
the Volga, to the industrial sections of the 
country, and into Rumania. Throughout the 
trip Mr. Ruhl keeps America in mind, and his 
contrasts and comparisons with life in our own 



land help to throw into relief the manners and 
i-u-stoms of a foreign people. 

Nowhere does a premonitory sound of coming 
events disturb the silence of the white nights. 
No threatening cloud tells of the approaching 
storm. It is not the hush of expectancy. Russia, 
though at war, is at peace with itself. And yet 
this is Russia "on the eve," as Turgenev said. 
A few brief months, and Russia felt the shock 
of the vast upheaval. 

Present-day Russia is almost as enigmatic and 
puzzling as was the Russia of yesterday. The 
Revolution has lost its simplicity. To our 
anxious vision it appears huge, stumbling, in- 
choate, and unaimed. Some have the graver fear 
that conditions in Russia are hopelessly and irre- 
mediably anarchic. But we must recognize the 
fact that a painless consummation of a people's 
freedom is impossible. In time of war sensi- 
bilities become acute and fears intensified. In 
addition to the sharper apprehensions of war- 
time, there is our nearness in time to profound 
and as yet uncrystallized events. In his "His- 
tory of the Revolution of 1905," Khrustalyev- 
Nosar, president, in those days, of the Petrograd 
Council of Workingmen's Deputies, writes: 
"Mass movements are like gigantic frescoes. 
Seen from near, the outlines of the picture dis- 
appear, the colors are fused into a number of 
separate, screaming spots; the creative idea of 
the artist is lost. . . Only at a distance does 
the fresco return to life and speak of the force 
and power of artistic genius. It is in the same \va\ 
that we must proceed to an estimate of a mass 
movement." We are far from having a long 
and untroubled perspective. But surely, some 
of our present fears are no more than horrible im- 
aginings. It is true that in Russia to-day, so much 
is at stake for the world's democracy that a soft, 
easy sense of security is dangerous. There are 
many forces striving, openly or by devious \va\ s. 
to undo the first accomplishment of the Revo- 
lution. Among the enemies of a democratic Rus- 
sia are many self-styled "friends" of the Russian 
people, who would rescue them from "the grave 
menace" of republicanism. We in America must 
remember that the Russian Revolution is the fir>r 
great victory, in the war which is now our war, 
for the Allies and for the world. It is a victory 
so tremendous and inspiring that we. who have 
seen it come about in our own day, cannot fore- 
see its full sweep or compass its immeasurable 



effects.

Psychoanalysis as a Pathfinder 

THE PSYCHOANALYTIC METHOD. By Oskar Pfis- 
ter. Authorized translation by Charles Rock- 
well Payne. (Moffat, Yard & Co.; $4.) 

The Freudian psychology has travelled a course 
that might have been predicted with tolerable 
certainty. At first received with mingled de- 
rision and disgust, it has now attained a position 
not only of virtual security but, one is almost 
tempted to say unfortunately, of very genuine 
and widespread popularity. Whitmanesque po- 
ets sing paeans to Jung's libido, one of the 
metaphysical offshoots of the psychoanalytic 
movement, while half-baked doctors fearlessly 
disentangle homosexual "complexes" at the end 
of a first half-hour's consultation with hysterical 
patients. Those who are profoundly convinced 
of the epoch-making importance of the psycho- 
logical mechanisms revealed by Freud and, even 
more, of the extraordinary suggestiveness of 
numerous lines of inquiry opened up by psycho- 
analysis, without, at the same time, being blind 
to criticisms that need to be made of certain 
aspects of psychoanalytic theory, can only hope 
and pray that this not altogether healthy over- 
popularity of the subject prove no hindrance to 
the study of the perplexing problems with which 
the Freudian psychology bristles. What is sorely 
needed at the present time, or will be before 
many years, is a thoroughly objective probing into 
the new psychology with a special view to seeking 
out the paths of reconciliation with the older 
orthodox psychology of conscious states and to 
the rigorous elimination of all aspects of Freudian 
theory that seem dispensable or ill-substantiated. 
The present militant attitude of the psycho- 
analysts toward their skeptical schoolmasters is 
naturally but a passing phase. The opposed 
schools of psychological interpretation will have 
to meet each other half way and effect a common 
modus vivendi. 

For the present it is obvious that the personal 
bias of the brilliant founder of psychoanalysis has 
given the Freudian psychology more than one 
twist that is not altogether necessitated by its in- 
valuable kernel the proof of the existence in the 
unconscious mind of emotionally toned "com- 
plexes," repressed trends that are directly elabo- 
rated out of the instinctive life and that leak out 
into consciousness in a large number of superfi- 
cially dissimilar psychic phenomena, for example, 
dreams, automatic and compulsive reactions, neu- 
rotic symptoms. A firm belief in the validity 



of the main lines of psychological theory set forth 
by Freud by no means necessitates an unreserved 
adherence to such incidental concomitants as his 
apparently one-sided interpretation of sexual per- 
versions or his general conception of the com- 
pound nature of the sexual instinct. At the least, 
very radical shiftings of emphasis are certain to 
emerge. An analogous development has char- 
acterized the history of the theory of organic 
evolution. Only recently has the original Dar- 
winian bias toward an overemphasis of the fac- 
tor of natural selection yielded to the proper eval- 
uation of other factors. The inertia of impetus 
given by the founder of a radical scientific depar- 
ture is, indeed, one of the most humiliating, 
one of the most ironically human, things about 
the history of science. So far there seems to be 
a disposition on the part of psychoanalysts to 
accept the whole Freudian programme at prac- 
tically its face value. What criticism there is 
within the ranks is chiefly on matters of rela- 
tively minor import. Even the Jung sedition, 
of which so much is made, consists of hardly 
more, it would seem, than a tendency to gener- 
alize and carry further some of the more doubt- 
ful elements of Freud's theoretical groundwork. 
I refer particularly to Jung's handling of sym- 
bolization as an interpretative principle and to 
his reckless application of the principles of indi- 
vidual psychoanalysis to cultural phenomena. 

We shall be disappointed if we turn to Pfis- 
ter's extensive treatise in the hope of finding 
such a critical and reconciliatory survey of psy- 
choanalytic research. It does not advance the 
subject very perceptibly in the direction indi- 
cated. There is, to be sure, a fair amount of 
critical comment en passant on particular Freud- 
ian positions, but the whole is mainly a summary, 
and a very convenient and useful one, of the typ- 
ical psychoanalytic interpretations. The greater 
part of the book deals with the analysis and 
mechanism of repression, constant use being 
made of case material. The latter portion deals 
with the application as a practical technique of 
the theory developed in detail in the preceding 
pages. What particularly distinguishes "The 
Psychoanalytic Method" is the emphasis placed 
upon the usefulness and future possibilities of 
psychoanalysis for pedagogic purposes, curative 
and prophylactic. We learn, for instance, that 
lack of success in the business of teaching is to 
no inconsiderable degree due to the presence of 
powerful repressions in teachers themselves. May 
we hope that when pedagogues and students alike 



268

I >r|.trml>T J7 



shall have had the obstructive cobwebs cleared 
out of their unconscious by psychoanalytic exam- 
ination, we shall be able to bid welcome to an 
educational regime that with conscious intelli- 
gence frames a pedagogical technique bearing a 
genuine relation to the life problems of its sub- 
jects? 

The book, while nowhere rising to the bril- 
liance of some of the Freudian writings them- 
selves, is probably the most careful and inclusive 
presentation yet published in English of the re- 
sults attained and the theories elaborated by 
Freud and his followers. It excels in this respect 
such works as Brill's "Psychanalysis" and Hitsch- 
mann's "Freud's Theories of the Neuroses." Un- 
fortunately, Dr. Payne's translation can claim 
only a moderate measure of success. The over- 
literalness of the renderings has given numerous 
passages an irksome awkwardness and, occasion- 
ally, obscurity. One needs sometimes to trans- 
late back to the German to arrive at the intended 
nuance of meaning. 

Let us turn, now, to the theoretical structure 
reared by the psychoanalysts. We are entitled 
to ask: Leaving all questions of analytic detail 
and technique to one side, what are some of the 
basic contributions of the Freudian school to 
psychologic thinking? First and foremost, I 
should say, is the new spirit of attitude and 
method that psychoanalysis has introduced into 
the study of the mind. The orthodox psychology, 
for all its disavowal of the older faculty-mon- 
gering, has never really succeeded in grasping 
the vast network of individual mental phenomena 
as a single growth rooting in the most primitive 
type of mental life we know of, the instinctive 
life. It would be too much to say that psycho- 
analysis has succeeded in reconstructing the order 
of differentiation of mental phenomena, but it 
has taken a more patient attitude toward the 
actual dynamics of the individual mind and is 
thus in a better position to ferret out gradually 
the development of the fundamental instincts 
into the higher forms of mentality. Psycho- 
analysis takes hold of chunks of mental life as 
they present themselves in experience; it does not 
abstract driblets of mental experience for the 
purpose of classifying them and examining them 
under the microscope. In brief, the older psy- 
chology is an anatomy of mind, sometimes re- 
fined ; psychoanalysis is an entering wedge toward 
a physiology of mind, generally quite crude for 
the present. From the clear recognition of this 
difference of method results the conviction that 



the two types of psychologic inquiry are not in 
any true sense opposed to each other. They 
merely attack their subject-matter from distinct 
viewpoints. They will, each of them, in the 
long run be found to be indispensable and mu- 
tually reconcilable. 

The second point of capital importance that 
we must set down to the credit of psychoanalysis 
is the light it has thrown on the nature and 
functioning of the unconscious. To psychoanaly- 
sis the unconscious is not merely a negative deus 
ex machina which does convenient service in the 
explanation of memory and in the positing of a 
continuity of personality. It is a very real and 
active domain from which are worked the strings 
that move about the puppets of the conscious self. 
The naive assumption of a self-contained con- 
sciousness whose motivation is safely interpret- 
able in terms of conscious data alone has been 
exposed by the Freudian psychology as a huge 
fallacy. 

One of the most interesting and promising 
vistas that have been opened up, though I find 
it but little stressed by the psychoanalysts 
themselves, is the quantitative consideration of 
emotion and will. I am not referring to the 
measuring of reactions under controlled experi- 
mental conditions. When psychoanalysis tells us 
that the emotion belonging to a certain trend 
is not always discharged in consciousness but 
may in part be inhibited in the unconscious or 
transferred to other reactions, we are evidently 
confronted by certain quantitative implications. 
It seems difficult to avoid the inference of a cer- 
tain specific, theoretically measurable, sum of 
emotion or volitional impulse which can be di- 
vided up and distributed in a great variety of 
ways. The elaboration of the concepts that fol- 
low on the heels of this hypothesis has been but 
begun. It would not be surprising if this glim- 
mer of a quantitative understanding of mental 
functioning blossomed out in time to an exact- 
ness of comprehension of psychological processes 
such as we have hardly an inkling of at present. 

Among the more readily defined and generally 
recognized insights that we owe, directly or indi- 
rectly, to Freud are the genetic analysis and the 
treatment of the neuroses, to a much smaller 
extent also of the psychoses (forms of insanity) ; 
the frequency and radical importance of symbol- 
formation in the unconscious mind, understand- 
ing of which is sure to prove indispensable for 
an approach to the deeper problems of religion 
,m<l arr ; the analysis and interpretation of

dreams; the basic importance of the psychic sex- 
ual constitution, not merely in its proper func- 
tional sphere, but also in connections that seem 
unrelated; the far-reaching importance of infan- 
tile psychic experiences in adult life and the 
ever-present tendency to regression to them; and 
the general light thrown on the problem of men- 
tal determinism. Many other points might be 
enumerated, some clearly defined, others contro- 
versial. Indeed, there has scarcely ever been a 
new road opened in science that so spontaneously 
and fruitfully branched out into tributary trails. 
It is true that hardly anything is known' of the 
psychoanalytic problems and solutions with abso- 
lutely satisfying clarity. Yet it takes no bold 
man to assert that enough has been glimpsed to 
promise perhaps the greatest fructification that 
the study of the mind has yet experienced.

The ^Darkness of Mystical Light 

PERSONALITY. By Rabindranath Tagore. (Mac- 
millan Co.; $1.35.) 

There is a world which science knows nothing 
about and of whose existence intellect is igno- 
rant. It must be known immediately if at all; 
it must be tasted, savored. Intellect gives us 
only knowledge about, and that is why it fails 
to reveal the more vital, the more real world 
familiar to those who know the ineffable joy of 
direct, warm contact with the reality which lies 
within and beyond what the blurring senses and 
the nibbling intellect disclose. The poverty of 
occidental life, the failure of western civiliza- 
tion, the restlessness of modern man and woman, 
all these are due to our infatuation with the 
clothes of the world and our disdain of the living 
personality within. After some such fashion ar- 
gues Rabindranath Tagore. 

There is, of course, nothing startling or new 
in this appraisal of human intelligence. The his- 
tory of speculation is full of it. If there is any- 
thing novel about Tagore, it is to be found in 
the way he attempts the liquidation of the bank- 
rupt West by drawing upon the spiritual riches 
of the East. And there, too, is the difficulty. 
Although Tagore would lead us from the wrong 
philosophy of life to the right, and although he 
uses language as a medium, he refuses to define 
his terms. To define, he tells us, is to abstract and 
to kill. One must sense, taste, experience the 
truth or miss it quite. Real knowledge is not from 



without through appearance, but from within 
through sympathy. Man faces the world as 
body, with its hungers and thirsts ; as mind, with 
its craving to find out reason in things; as per- 
son, with its needs of love. As the mind does 
not eat bread, leaving that to the body, so the 
person does not subsist on abstract facts, leaving 
those to the mind. "It is the highest in man, 
this personal man. And it has personal relations 
of its own with the great world, and comes to 
it for something to satisfy personality." And 
here, urges Tagore, science and logic give place 
to the creative impulse, that is to say, to art. 
"When a feeling has been aroused in our hearts 
which is far in excess of the amount that can 
be absorbed by the object which has produced it, 
it comes back to us and makes us conscious of 
ourselves by its return waves." This conscious- 
ness of self, or personality, requires an outpour 
of expression, and thus art arises. Art is the 
display resulting from the consciousness of the 
wealth of personality. Consequently, in artistic 
creation man reveals himself rather than his ob- 
jects. Moreover, he reveals another world. As 
science arrives at a world of facts, forces, and 
laws, so art, through its creations, discloses a 
world of personality. For the consciousness of 
the inexhaustible abundance of personality which 
gives rise to art is awareness of a more than self ; 
it is awareness of the infinite in the personal man. 
"In art the person in us is sending its answers 
to the Supreme Person, who reveals Himself to 
us in a world of endless beauty across the light- 
less world of facts." 

This "World of Personality" is reserved for 
separate discussion in the second chapter. I have 
to confess that I make nothing of it. There are 
some pleasant passages and now and then a bit 
of penetrating criticism of occidental life, but 
for the most part metaphor steps on the heels 
of metaphor, ex cathedra assertions elbow, one 
another, lame analogies hobble on supported by 
the arm of occultism, and what I fear is beauti- 
ful verbiage is offered as profound wisdom 
backed by the authority of Isha Upanishat. 
Words appear to have just meaning enough to 
enable the author to employ them in the demon- 
stration that they have no true meaning at all, 
and reason is reliable only when disproving its 
reliability. Formal definition is frowned upon, 
but snap definitions abound, and while scientific 
analysis and rigorous logic are asserted to be 
avenues of error, analysis and logic are not dis- 
pensed with. How could they be in an argu- 



270

ment aiming to show us wherein and why man- 
kind is going astray and whither lie the happy 
isles? No; analysis and logic remain, but become 
irresponsible. In this regard Tagore is true to 
the mystical type. There is a willingness, con- 
sciously or unconsciously, to make use of intel- 
lectual instrumentalities, but a refusal to accept 
the responsibility which goes with their use. As 
an example of how differently the thing may be 
done, one turns to Samuel Butler's argument 
for the same thesis in his "God the Known and 
God the Unknown." Starting, as does Tagore, 
from the refusal of the human being to be psy- 
chically alone in the universe, Butler avowedly 
accepts the advantages and risks of intelligence 
and proceeds logically to prove that the universe 
is a person. Butler's little volume should be 
read with Tagore's "The World of Personality." 
But as long as Tagore writes such vital, color- 
ful English as he does in places even in this 
chapter, he will be read, whatever faults he may 
be guilty of. This for a sample: 

From the beginning of his history man has been 
feeling the touch of personality in all creation, and 
trying to give it names and forms, weaving it in 
legends round his life and the life of his races, offer- 
ing it worship and establishing relations with it 
through countless forms of ceremonials. This feeling 
of the touch of personality has given the centrifugal 
impulse in man's heart to break out in a ceaseless 
flow of reaction, in songs and pictures and poems, in 
images and temples and festivities. This has been 
the centripetal force which attracted men into groups 
and clans and communal organizations. And while 
man tills his soil and spins his cloths, mates and 
rears his children, toils for wealth and fights for 
power he does not forget to proclaim in languages 
of solemn rhythm, in mysterious symbols, in structures 
of majestic stone that in the heart of his world he 
has met the Immortal Person. In the sorrow of 
death, and suffering of despair, when trust has been 
betrayed and love desecrated, when existence be- 
comes tasteless and unmeaning, man standing upon 
the ruins of his hopes stretches his hands to the 
heavens to feel the touch of the Person across his 
darkened world. 

If the same man who wrote the second chapter 
wrote the third, Tagore is a striking case of dual 
personality. For the chapter entitled "The Sec- 
ond Birth" is not only clear and coherent where 
the preceding chapter is muddled and topsy- 
turvy, but is a well-sustained study in place of 
a hodgepodge of dubious, more or less related, 
observations. "The Second Birth" is written by 
a man who has experienced, observed, and 
thought, and not in average measure. And it 
makes sense, although the topic is profound. 
Moreover, it appears to differ in doctrine from 
what precedes. The senses and the intellect are 
no longer in such utter disgrace. On the con- 



trary, the life of the senses, of the intellect, of 
the spirit are so many planes of cooperating en- 
deavor in man's effort to create a world in which 
he can feel at home out of the world which has 
been given him, and which is foreign and opprr>- 
sive. There is no break between the struggle 
for food, the craving for knowledge, the longing 
for union with the Universal One. Each leads 
through conflict with obstacles to a consciousness 
of self, the two former to a consciousness of 
self as desiring things other than they are; the 
latter (that is why it is the second birth), to a 
consciousness of self as striving to desire what 
should be desired. We thus find a defence 
instead of a denunciation of science, and the m\>- 
tical experience of union with the Supreme Per- 
son is not isolated and insulated from all other 
experiences, but is the crowning success of an 
unbroken, though differentiated, creative effort 
reaching from the struggle of animals to adjust 
themselves to their physical environment to man's 
consciousness of the Person in the world. 

The discussion of "The Second Birth" repre- 
sents the climax of the book. Three other chap- 
ters follow: an interesting one on the author's 
school in Bengal, established for the purpose of 
educating youth toward rather than away from 
the life of the spirit; another, evidently intended 
for disciples, entitled "Meditation"; and the 
last, "On Woman." The present age, this last 
chapter teaches, is a masculine age, an age of 
economics, politics, and their consequent mili- 
tarism. The absurdity of this type of civiliza- 
tion, thinks Tagore, has become evident even 
to man, and there is hope that the lost social 
balance will be restored by putting the full 
weight of woman into the creation of the human 
world. Not, however, by encouraging the fem- 
inist movement, which is a symbol of vacuity and 
unrest, but by making possible the free play of 
woman's superior socializing power. And this 
is to be secured through the passive quality which 
"has given woman that large and deep placidity 
which is so necessary for the healing and nour- 
ishing and storing of life." Tagore deplores the 
\\ extern woman's loss of interest in the common 
things of life, and says, if I understand him, with 
more breadth of outlook to be sure, but with the 
-amc finality, what was asserted long ago by a 
member of the race which is just now without 
the bounds of our sympathetic imagination: Die 
voman's blace is on der sthove."

The Imagists 



SOME IMAGIST POETS, 1917. (Houghton Mifflin 
Co.; 75 cts.) 

The Imagists come forward once more with 
their annual Anthology, and the publishers place 
a proper perhaps a necessary typographical 
emphasis on the date. The little group remains 
the same, whether in composition or in spirit: 
early rebels are still in the outer darkness, and 
no new converts have been admitted. Nor is 
the offering of 1917 very different from that of 
1916. Here they all are, very much like them- 
selves: the two A's, Richard Aldington and his 
wife ("H. D."); the two F's, Fletcher and 
Flint ; and the two L's, D. H. Lawrence and 
Amy Lowell. Three are English ; three are 
American ; and if three, instead of two, were 
women, the symmetry, in all ways, had been com- 
plete. 

If poetry, in general, exacts the union of the 
intense (or concentrated) and of the sensuous; 
if Imagist poetry, in particular, demands a short 
succession of brief, clean-cut pictures, with unifi- 
cation and humanization either permeating it or 
secured somehow before the end, then Richard 
Aldington's "Inarticulate Grief" may be taken 
as a nearly perfect paradigm. Here is a sketch 
of it nine lines of its eighteen: 

Let the sea beat its thin torn hands 
In anguish against the shore ; 

Let it 

. . shriek out its agony 
Across waste sands and marshes ; 
. Let it sob and scream and laugh 
In a sharp fury, 
With white salt tears 
Wet on its writhen face ; . . . 
For the sea is the cry of our sorrow. 

"H. D." keeps to the Greeks Adonis, Pyg- 
malion, Eurydice. Her sands run staccato 
through the reader's mental fingers; golden, per- 
haps, but yet sands. Some sweat of the reader's 
mind is required to produce the moisture for 
remoulding all this yellow dryness into the form 
which it may have possessed in the mind of its 
creator. Perhaps no one of "H. D.'s" four elab- 
orate pieces quite equals "The Shrine," of last 
year's volume a poem which (on a second or 
third reading) declares itself a kind of criterion 
for the Compleat Imagist. Here are lines from 
"The God," whose face is dark, 

set beneath heavy locks, 

circled with stiff ivy-fruit, 

clear, 

cut with great hammer-stroke, 

brow, nose and mouth, 

mysterious and far distant 

from my sense. 



I asked: 

can he from his portals of ebony 

carved with grapes, 

turn toward the earth? 

The "blasphemy" of this last inquiry was re- 
buked; the god could and did. 

The war is heard throughout the present vol- 
ume: in Aldington's "Field Manoeuvres," in 
Fletcher's "Armies," a sombre yet vivid thing, 
and in Flint's concern with "Searchlight" and 
"Zeppelins." From the latter: 

What is that behind the trees? 

A flame-colored circle of light that glows 

and grows brighter and dimmer by turns. 

Is it an airship on fire? 

It turns on, and moves nearer, slowly; 

it swings clear of the trees 

the moon ! 

Mr. Flint, to a degree not shared by all his 
group, has a consciousness of human relationships 
and some concern for expressing them; in his 
"Dusk," particularly, and in his "Soldiers," ad- 
dressed apparently to Aldington. 

As "H. D.," though of the New World, is 
always consistently anthological, and as Amy 
Lowell is represented here solely by a series of 
Japanese pieces (already made familiar by 
"Poetry"), the American note is struck by John 
Gould Fletcher alone. Two noteworthy things 
of his must be mentioned the "Lincoln," in 
which a method that, to many, will still seem 
alien is applied with picturesqueness and pathos 
to a theme conspicuously indigenous; and his 
"Blackberry Harvest," a Bacchic revel with 
berry-picking children upon, it may be, the hill- 
sides of the poet's native Arkansas: 

And there wells up in me a drunken impulse of 

autumn, 

To fling myself into the tangle; . . .

D. H. Lawrence is represented by a single 
rather long and elaborate poem, "Terra Nuova," 
which might be vulgarly translated, "The New 
Deal." Here, like some of the others, he passes 
through the smoke of war; and here, as in his 
"Erinnyes," of last year, he is concerned with 
war's havoc. He ends as "dead," "trodden to 
nought," and then, with 

every vestige gone then I am here, 

discovered, setting my foot on another world. . . 

Mr. Lawrence is inexhaustibly vigorous; but 
there must be pardon for those who, with the 
best will in the world, still find him turbid,

whether in his nature or in his art, and who

Miss Lowell closes the book with a score of 
net little pieces from the world of prints and 
lacquer; "Patterns," of 1916, has no successor, 
no peer. The last and longest of these, "The 
Camellia Tree of Matsue," gives still another 
treatment to a theme now well known and pop-

English Sports and Foreign 
Temperaments 

BEYOND. By John Galsworthy. (Charles Scrib- 

ner's Sons; $1.50.) 

Mr. Galsworthy is an intellectual aristocrat 
who has rebelled against his own class and yet 
presents it with self-evident justice and authority. 
He has drawn the iniquities of the lords of the 
earth, sometimes with bitter keenness, sometimes 
with sad gravity. And among those lords he has 
found a type which has always commanded the 
respect of Englishmen and Americans and is the 
justification of the class. This type is the good 
sport. 

The good sport is different from the gentle- 
man. He is better and stronger, including the 
gentleman and something more. For a gentle- 
man may be undeniably a fine gentleman and 
yet have too delicate nerves or be physically ill 
or timid or socially shy. The good sport is all 
there. He may be narrow-minded and not deeply 
educated, but he has a kind of mental courage; 
and he takes physical courage for granted. He 
may be a Philistine, indifferent to the arts, but 
he has good bearing, social grace, and cultivated 
speech. He makes an excellent leader of soldiers. 
He maintains a calm manner in difficult circum- 
stances and keeps a stiff upper lip under the buf- 
fetings and sorrows of life. He is capable of 
deep passion, which goes with strong physique, 
and if necessary he conceals it with perfect self- 
discipline. As a matter of course he is honest, 
true to his word, and tries to be just in his treat- 
ment of equals and inferiors. He is not a snob, 
because well, because he is just too good a sport 
to be a snob. 



HD\V often this admirable character appears in 
English society I, as a not much travelled Amer- 
ican, do not know. But we have met him fre- 
quently in the finer English novels, romantic and 
realistic. Henry Esmond is a good sport; the 
scene in which he denounces the prince is a classic 
exhibition of the English sportsmanlike attitude 
toward a fellow, a Frenchman, who has not 
played the game fairly. Such unlike individuals 
as Trollope's Duke, Meredith's Evan Harring- 
ton (who, you remember the point of the story, 
is not technically a gentleman), and Nevil Beau- 
champ, are all true to the type. Mr. Gals- 
worthy's Patrician is a perfect specimen. 

"Beyond" is a study of two good sports, father 
and daughter, who love intensely, suffer greatly, 
and bear their loss with fine fortitude. The 
story is a tragedy of sex, two tragedies indeed, 
cruelly moving and relentless, touched with some- 
what the same color that makes "The Dark 
Flower" so sombrely glowing. It is a greater 
story than "The Dark Flower," and so is "The 
Patrician," because the characters are stronger, 
their natures contain many forces besides sexual 
passion. Those who see in the story only a sen- 
sational appeal to our sexual emotions miss the 
theme. 

"Che faro senza ?" That is the motive. 
What shall I do when I have lost? Take the 
blow with an unbowed head, pull through, and 
live for the other things and the other people 
that make up life. It is the gospel according to 
Browning. Stake everything and pocket your 
losses without whimpering. Stoicism is an old 
philosophy, often enough repeated in abstract 
terms. The novelist here has shown real people, 
dominated by passion, terribly hurt by it, then 
dominant over their sorrow, and not so small as 
to indulge in regrets. It is a superb piece of 
work, so honestly and manfully conceived that 
I felt a momentary desire to assassinate the "lit- 
erary editor" of a Boston newspaper who ex- 
pressed the piously prudish hope that in this 
book Mr. Galsworthy had sung his "swan song" 
of sex. 

If the English novelist finds among his own 
countrymen models of steady-headed, sound- 
hearted, thoroughbred heroes who are, however, 
human, passionate, liable to taste the Heaven and 
the Hell of illicit relations (and so shock lit- 
erary editors who ought to be in a nunnery) 
if the English novelist feels that a man like Win- 
ton in "Beyond" is English to the backbone, 
why does the novelist always have to go abroad

THE DIAL

for the contrasting, irresponsible "artistic tem- 
perament"? Is the country that produced 
Byron and Swinburne not regarded by its own 
novelists as capable of producing erratic geniuses ? 
I suppose Svengali had to be, or pretend to be, 
a Pole, and the pianist in Arnold Bennett's "Sa- 
cred and Profane Love" had to be the same sort 
of mongrel (Scotch and Danish plus a Spanish 
stepfather!), and Galsworthy's "fiddler fellow," 
whose music snares Gyp, had to be a Swede. 
That England- is not prolific of musicians is a 
matter of fact, and it is true that musicians, 
because of their art, are plausible perturbers of 
English girls and dramatic foils to unmusical 
Englishmen. But, aside from the enchantments 
of music and the supposed wildness o'f musicians, 
the Englishman seems to regard erotic vivacity 
and romance as extra-English, continental, even 
Scotch or Irish, but not English. 

When Mr. Galsworthy wishes to give to Major 
Winton's daughter a little more of the artistic 
and romantic than appears in her equally peccant 
but four-fourths English father, he provides her 
with an Italian maternal grandmother. That, 
added to difference of sex, accounts for anything 
in Gyp that is not in her sire. (And Gyp is 
perfectly her father's daughter a rare thing in 
fiction, as Stevenson said of Roderick Hudson 
and his mother.) Another added foreign touch 
which makes Gyp understandable to English- 
men among whom prevails the greater than the 
great commandments : "Really, you know, it isn't 
done!" is her name. A girl whose name is Gyp 
can defy English society, whereas a girl named 
Anne or Ruth (as a much bolder girl might be 
named) would be simply smothered. 

I do not mean to be flippant in discussing this 
point or any point connected with such a sincere 
book as "Beyond." This apparently trivial ques- 
tion goes to the heart of international issues, 
which are terribly vexed just now. Mr. Gals- 
worthy calls her Gyp, which to my mind sug- 
gests a Frenchwoman (is it not the nom de 
guerre of a modern French novelist?). Would 
Gyp have done what she did if her name had 
been Lydia? Or did her parents name her Gyp 
because they subconsciously selected the name 
appropriate to the kind of character they were 
transmitting? 

Mr. Bennett's heroine in "Sacred and Profane 
Love" is named Carlotta. Did you ever know 
an English girl or an American girl of New 
England stock named Gyp or Carlotta? Car- 
lotta's nice, respectable aunt is named Constance, 



of course. What would have happened if the 
aunt had been named Carlotta and the niece, 
Constance? How does the title of Meredith's 
novel sound if we change it to "Mabel of the 
Crossways"? This is not a play with names. 
It is a play with the romance which is around 
names and with the habit of English novelists 
of ascribing romantic ideas and ethical irregu- 
larities to foreign-sounding names, even when 
the names designate persons of pure or prepon- 
derant English stock. 

Is the reason for this that the nations find in 
other nations villainies and indecencies unknown 
at home, and also romance unknown at home? 
Is it possible that villainies and indecencies and 
romance go together because we all like them' 
but do not dare indulge them at home? Do 
we not assimilate to ourselves and our na- 
tion all the respectable virtues and impute to for- 
eigners things that are not quite nice and proper, 
even when for some of the things that are not 
nice and proper we have a secret liking? We 
suspect our neighbors, dare not be as they are, 
or, assuming superiority, would not be as they 
are. One aspect of this idea is gently satirized 
in "Beauchamp's Career"; the misgivings which 
Beauchamp's love affair causes in the hearts of 
his good English relatives are partly due to the 
fact that Renee is a Frenchwoman. 

I do not know (for one person cannot know 
the literature of all the nations) how far con- 
tinental novelists show a corresponding feeling 
of contempt, or suspicion, or romantic strange- 
ness, for each other and for England. There 
is a story by Maupassant, the name of which I 
forget, which turns on a Frenchman's detesta- 
tion of all things English; that, of course, is not 
Maupassant's attitude but the attitude he as- 
scribes to his character. A Spaniard told me 
that in his national literature there is no trace 
of such hostility to the English as English liter- 
ature betrays toward the Spaniard. Is it too 
much to hope that after the war we may begin to 
rid ourselves of the superstitions of national su- 
periority, and at the same time to discover and 
prize the fine shades of difference which arise 
from and give value to independent national de- 
velopment ? Not only may our state of mind im- 
prove; the English have already learned that 
Frenchmen, Belgians, and Poles can be good 
sports: but the facts of national life may im- 
prove; perhaps in time England may have musi- 
cians as great as her novelists. JOHN MACY

Discipline 



MARCHING MEN. By Sherwood Anderson. (John 
Lane Co.; $1.50.) 

It is a curious, mixed, provocative, and occa- 
sionally exasperating book, this second novel of 
Mr. Anderson's; but it is also interesting 
chiefly, to my mind, as the exhibition of a tem- 
perament and the setting forth of a point of view 
that is highly idiosyncratic. Naturally all brief 
characterizations are unfair, but I suppose 
"Marching Men" might be described as a pasan 
to order and (quite incidentally, I hope) a naked 
and somewhat febrile celebration of force. It is, 
in fact, too insistently, too stridently and re- 
morselessly dedicated to the main theme to make 
a wholly satisfactory novel. Nevertheless, it 
seems to me only natural that a book celebrating 
order, even a little shrilly, should have grown 
out of all the clutter and confusion of Chicago, 
and no doubt we should have had such a book 
even if Mr. Wells hadn't long since set the 
fashion. 

In the days following the World's Fair Chi- 
cago began to accustom itself to criticism none 
too tolerantly at first. Mr. Herrick was able 
to raise the dust by his mild animadversions on 
the architectural peculiarities of Cottage Grove 
Avenue. Such criticisms were easily dismissed as 
the morbidities of a sense refined, and possibly 
over-refined, by a prolonged familiarity with 
softer European surfaces, the vagaries, in short, 
of a delicate ego. Mr. Anderson, on the con- 
trary, although he studies the Chicago of the 
same period, has little to say of our aesthetic 
lapses. No; what troubles him is our spiritual 
untidiness, our stupidity in the sphere of social 
integration, our vast welter of meaningless and 
frustrate lives. He is expressing, in other words, 
what has become the conventionality of the mo- 
ment, but expressing it with a great deal of pas- 
sion and in a way that is distinctive enough to 
excite interest. It is worth noting that neither 
our crudity nor our violence disturbs him. Force 
indeed, far from repelling him, fascinates him 
with what I can only call a slightly pathological 
fascination. His hero is a Berserker with a big 
fist, whose most potent argument is always a 
blow. 

There is a corresponding violence in Mr. 
Anderson's own method. He sets his theme, for 
example, on the third page. "Standing in the 
doorway and looking up and down the bleak 
village street, some dim realization of the dis- 



organized ineffectiveness of life as he knew it 
came into the mind of the McGregor boy." And 
on the next page, the boy reflects: "If I could 
form the men of this place into an army I would 
lead them to the mouth of the old Shumway cut 
and push them in. . ." McGregor is then a lad 
of fourteen or so, living in Coal Creek, Penns\I- 
vania. I daresay there are bespectacled little 
monsters with a premature appetite for political 
philosophy who might muse so ; but a boy simply 
bursting with vigor, a boy like "Cracked" Mc- 
Gregor's son; no, no! The love of order has 
always seemed to me to be distinctly a middle- 
aged virtue, associated with flagging vitality and 
the inability to absorb shocks. By this failure 
of the retrospective imagination, we are earlv 
warned to expect no nuances in Mr. Anderson's 
book, and so we are prepared for other reflections 
of this untaught miner's son. 

Men of Coal Creek . . . listen to the voice of Mc- 
Gregor. I hate you ... I hate you because you are 
weak and disorganized like cattle. I would like to 
come among you teaching the power of force. I would 
like to slay you one by one, not with weapons but with 
my naked fists. If they have made you work like rats 
buried in a hole they are right. It is the man's right 
to do what he can. Get up and fight. Fight and I'll 
get on the other side and you can fight me. I'll help 
drive you back into your holes. 

An adolescent Nietzsche might conceivably have 
heated his brain with such flights, but McGregor 
is throughout the foe of intellect. Why talk ? 
Babbling makes a man loose-jawed and flabby. 
"On and on through life we go, socialists, dream- 
ers, makers of laws, sellers of goods and believers 
in suffrage for women and we continuously say 
words, worn-out words, crooked words, words 
without power or pregnancy in them." 

When McGregor arrives in Chicago as a 
youth of eighteen or so, he is already filled with 
contempt for the talkers and there runs in his 
head the thought of marching men a troop of 
soldiers that had put down a riot at Coal Creek. 
That vision is the nucleus of his whole philosophy 
the "goose-step" is the way to solidarity. And 
so he sets the workers of Chicago to marching. 
Mr. Anderson's is surely the last word of anti- 
intellectualism ; for the men who follow Mc- 
Gregor do not know why they are marching or 
whither. Mr. Anderson doubtless took his cue 
from the solidarity of the peoples at war, but he 
forgets that if the leaders of those men are quite 
as cynical as McGregor with regard to the think- 
ing-powers of their men, they are still careful to 
supph substitutes. They manufacture public 
opinion and attach men to necessary purposes by 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



275 



holding forth the lure of ideals. So far as I am 
able to see, McGregor offers the marchers no 
end beyond the manifestation of power the 
power of the workers. Marching satisfies a deep 
disposition. Very well, let them march, and 
trust to luck that the collectivist mind will 
emerge. To present a programme would be 
only to repeat the old intellectualist fallacy of 
the socialists and the organizers. 

The habit of thinking in terms of groups and 
masses has rather blunted, I fancy, Mr. Ander- 
son's sense of the intimate and the personal. 
There are fugitive glints of tenderness here and 
there, such as McGregor's attachment to the 
memory of his father or his yearning toward the 
once despised miners who follow his mother's 
coffin up the hillside; but on the whole his emo- 
tional life, even in the most intimate relations, 
as those with the tuberculous girl, the plow- 
manufacturer's daughter, and the little milliner 
whom he finally marries, is disturbingly arid. 
With a dim sense of his mission in life, Mc- 
Gregor instinctively fears love. Women are re- 
morselessly possessive. And so McGregor sets 
himself the problem of loving without yielding 
to love. He rejects as contemptible the easy solu- 
tion of the artistic barber, who prowls by night 
and ogles by day. He often poses the problem, 
but in the end he does not solve it: he marries 
the little milliner, who has become a habit and 
will not divert his attention, rather than the 
plow-manufacturer's daughter, who has awak- 
ened his passion. You are left to infer, if you 
like, that McGregor ends as he had begun by 
distrusting passion as the lure of the gods seeking 
to snare men for their own purposes. Take the 
scene in which the two women struggle for Mc- 
Gregor's love: 

"Stop," she cried. "I do not want you. I would 
never marry you now. You belong to her. You are 
Edith's." 

McGregor's voice became soft and quiet. 

"Oh, I know," he said; "I know! I know! But I 
want children. Look at Edith. Do you think she could 
bear children to me?" 

A change came over Edith Carson. Her eyes hard- 
ened and her shoulders straightened. 

"That's for me to say," she cried, springing forward 
and clutching his arm. "That is between me and God. 
If you intend to marry me come now and do it. I was 
not afraid to give you up and I'm not afraid that I 
shall die bearing children." 

And after the decision is made McGregor says : 

One struggles to keep a thought in mind, to be im- 
personal, to see that life has a purpose outside his 
own purpose. You have perhaps made that struggle. 
You see I'm making it now. I'm going to take Edith 
and go back to work. 



There is an insensitiveness here that reflects 
itself even in the words. Mr. Anderson's anti- 
intellectualism will allow him to leave nothing 
to the reader; he can't trust us to understand, 
and therefore he shouts instead of whispering. 
But I venture to doubt whether even a parish- 
ioner of the Reverend Bernard Shaw or a disciple 
of Professor Pearson really takes the great leap 
in quite that spirit. 

To offset such deficiencies, Mr. Anderson has 
the skill to make you feel the thick press of life 
in great cities. The background of that clut- 
tered, disorderly, and violent life of the old South 
Side, with its Red-Light district that was notor- 
ious from Shanghai to St. Petersburg, is effec- 
tively realized. Mr. Anderson knows how mixed 
was the whole network of influences that en- 
meshed the town, from highest to lowest, and 
he shows very well the kind of civilization Chi- 
cago had then achieved. His touch in the boule- 
vards seems to me less sure, but then I should 
think the boulevards interest him very little, and 
he will not mind having such an impression 
recorded, especially since it is as far as possible 
from being an expert one. But when all is said 
Mr. Anderson's book interested me chiefly as the 
expression of a vigorous and sincere mind, a 
thoroughly individual mind, that stirs one to 
argument and tempts one to forget the author's 
own contempt for the chattering animal that is

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS 



ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE, Per- 
sonal Recollections by his cousin, Mrs. Dis- 
ney Leith. Putnam's; $2. 
A first feeling of disappointment comes when 
one discovers, at page 38, that the recollections 
are finished. The disappointment is a compound 
of surprise at their short length and mild anger 
at their lack of interest. No comment can sur- 
pass, no, nor equal, the certain effect of quota- 
tion. Here are two bits: "When he was at 
Brooke my mother and I went to see him after 
he was established there. He carried me off up 
to his own room, which he exhibited with great 
glee, saying: 'Everything in this room is mine.' 
I immediately pointed to a very large family 
portrait of a lady and child, saying: 'Is that 
yours?' 'No but everything else is.'" That is 
quoted as an example, presumably, of Algernon's 
early aptness at repartee. And this, "And what- 
ever his religious opinions were or were not,

our upbringing as doubtless they did in later 
days I never, in our years of unfettered and 
most familiar intercourse, remember him to have 
said anything to shock or distress me, or any- 
thing that was undesirable for me, as a child or 
girl, to hear," gives us the comforting assurance 
that one of England's great poets never shocked 
his female cousins. The remaining 218 pages 
are given to letters of little or no interest, which 
contain no particularly valuable references to 
people or events. The whole volume contains 
practically nothing that Mr. Gosse has not pre- 
sented, in one way or another, in his recent biog- 
raphy of the poet. 

THROUGH RUSSIA IN WAR TIME. By C. 

Fillingham Coxwell. Scribner's; $3.50. 

Political Russia is of more vital interest than 
physical Russia; but at the moment when the 
fate of that nation seems to centre in one city, 
it is not amiss to remember that Petrograd is 
one of the least representative cities of the new 
republic and that behind all its changes and its 
transitory emotions there lies the great mass of 
the Russian people, sturdy, industrious, and im- 
movable. To consider them steadies one's sense 
of proportion. Mr. Coxwell's book enables one 
so to consider them, for he has had a rare op- 
portunity for observation, since he travelled in 
1915 from Petrograd to the Crimea, and back by 
way of Tiflis, the Caspian, and the Volga, to 
Finland and Sweden. He has seen life in the 
cities and in the tents of nomad peoples. Nor 
did an imperfect acquaintance with Russian de- 
ter him from undertaking any journey that prom- 
ised returns in the matter of interest or of 
amusement. The faithful recital of his experi- 
ences in all these places forms a volume of un- 
usual interest in spite of a rather stilted manner, 
and the fact that the examination of a passport 
receives as much conscientious attention as a voy- 
age up the Volga or a visit to a Kalmuck village. 
The book is proof that the simple truth may be 
interesting, but in general we are willing to as- 
sume this without proof. 

THE CONSTITUTION OF CANADA. By Wil- 
liam R. Riddell. Yale University Press; 
$1.25. 

During the past academic year the lectures on 
the Dodge Foundation at Yale University were 
delivered by Judge Riddell, of the Supreme Court 
of Ontario. The subject discussed was the con- 
stitutional system of Canada, and the four lec- 
tures have now been published. The brevity of 
the book is such that only an outline of historical 
development is possible; even "The Constitution 
in its Actual Workings" and "A Comparative 
View" are set forth only on broad lines. Fur- 
thermore, the subject is treated with a non-legal 



audience always in mind. The student of history 
and government, as well as the student of law, 
will gain little from the volume, although a leu 
comparisons of the advantages and disadvam 
of the constitutional systems operating on the 
two sides of the Great Lakes challenge attention. 
Persons knowing nothing of the Canadian gov- 
ernment and desiring a brief, simple treatise on 
it, will find the little book useful. Generaliza- 
tions are indulged in with much freedom, and 
some are open to question. It certainly is not 
true, for example, that the American power of 
impeaching the President is "as dead as the royal 
veto" in England. 

THE EMANCIPATION OF THE AM ERR 

CITY. By Walter Tallmadge Arndt. Duf- 

field;$1.50. 

A delightful book to read is this, both because 
of the ease with which the author expresses him- 
self, even when dealing with matters of complex 
municipal finance, and because of his evident fa- 
miliarity with the city as an industrial, social, 
and political community. Home rule appears to 
the author to be the first step toward a solution 
of the many problems of the modern city. Not 
only is the achievement of this step necessary to 
enable the city to direct its affairs in its own 
interest, but it is indispensable to the training of 
its citizens in moral self-direction. Concentra- 
tion of business and political responsibility 
through commission government (or its equiva- 
lent), the short ballot, separation of local from 
national political issues, the substitution of inde- 
pendent for partisan tickets, an adequate and 
irreproachable civil service, the regulation and 
curtailment of public-utility franchises, the ra- 
tionalization and standardization of the finance 
methods of the city within the limits at least of 
solvency these are some of the most important 
reforms explained and urged. Such other more 
or less familiar topics as the initiative and refer- 
endum, the recall, preferential primaries, and 
reformed taxation are not forgotten. The view- 
point of the author is decidedly sane and pro- 
gressive, and the book may be trusted to hold 
the interest of the average reader. 

MUNICIPAL FUNCTIONS. By Herman G. 

James. Appleton; $2. 

"Municipal Functions" is the twelfth number 
in the "National Municipal League Series." It is 
popular in style, practical in aim but scientific 
in method, and will give the general reader an 
excellent perspective of the modern problems of 
dty government. Among the most important 
Chapters are two entitled "Public Morals" ami 
"Social Welfare." Here the author definitely

asserts the responsibility of the municipal govern- 
ment for better morals and greater welfare. He 
takes a liberal attitude toward Sunday amuse- 
ments. As regards the saloon and liquor prob- 
lem, he comes to the rather regrettable conclusion 
that this issue should be decided locally. Ade- 
quate provision must be made for suitable public 
recreation and in such a programme adults are 
not to be overlooked. He favors a board of 
censorship which shall examine moving-picture 
films before production, and thinks that in view 
of the difficulties involved in controlling the com- 
mercial dance halls, the city might experiment 
with municipal dance halls. He also urges vigor- 
ous action for the elimination of the social evil. 
Better housing is discussed but unusual em- 
phasis is laid on the limitations of municipal 
action and on the necessity of fundamental social 
reform to meet the real need. Cities can do 
much to lessen unemployment and to improve 
working conditions, though they alone cannot 
solve the problem, and there is need of better 
free medical care and legal aid for the poor. 

COMMUNITY DRAMA. By Percy Mackaye. 

Houghton Mifflin; 50 cts. 

There is a gap that is not to be bridged be- 
tween the written and the spoken language. An 
address set down in cold print, lacking the warm, 
dramatic appeal furnished by the speaker, is 
likely to prove an unsatisfying husk at best. At 
the worst and this is especially true of the in- 
timate and emotional, of the more informal, ad- 
dress its very form puts the reader on his guard 
against being cozened into accepting something 
fraudulent. 

It is rather hard to realize precisely what the 
value of such a book as Mr. Mackaye's may be. 
In its original form, as an address delivered be- 
fore the American Civic Association, it may have 
fulfilled its purpose of interpretation and sug- 
gestion. Printed, it is too slight to be of much 
value to the student of sociology or of the drama, 
nor specific enough to be of service to those in- 
terested in the practical aspects of the pageant or 
community play, and too emotional too senti- 
mental to carry conviction to the intellectually 
aware. 

Mr. Mackaye undoubtedly has something to 
say about community drama. His belief in its 
revolutionary character is worth a hearing. His 
suggestion that cooperative drama, in our military 
training camps and in our towns and cities and 
rural communities, should prove a democratizing 
influence deserves consideration. If, in his very 
real enthusiasm, he is over sanguine with regard 
to what community drama may be able to ac- 
complish in the way of helping to establish the

WOMEN OF BELGIUM. By Charlotte Kel- 
logg, with an introduction by Herbert C. 
Hoover. Funk & Wagnalls; $1. 
Readers who delighted in the vivid pictures of 
Belgium given to us by Charlotte Kellogg in the 
"Atlantic Monthly" under the title of "A Ci- 
nema of the C. R. B.," will be pleased to see 
them reappear with the addition of new "reels." 
Mrs. Kellogg, the only American woman mem- 
ber of the Committee for Relief in Belgium, 
worked in that country for several months 
among the French and Belgian women, and, at 
the request of Mr. Herbert Hoover, she has 
written of their work. 

There are many angles of vision, of course, 
from which one may consider the conditions in 
Belgium, and Mrs. Kellogg has elected to put 
her emphasis, not upon the source of the Belgian 
calamity, but rather upon the spiritual reaction 
of the women to the set of circumstances imposed 
upon them. For, as Mr. Hoover says in his 
introduction to this volume, "At first the morale 
of a whole people was crusht . . . but slowly 
and largely by the growth of the Relief Organi- 
zation and the demand it has made upon their 
exertion and their devotion, this morale has re- 
covered to a fine flowering of national spirit and 
stoical resolution." The particular work of the 
women has consisted (to quote Mr. Hoover 
again) in the "discrimination of the destitute 
from those who can pay, and the determination 
of their needs." 

By the convincing method of telling of inci- 
dents of which she was a witness, Mrs. Kellogg 
has paid a great tribute to the women of Bel- 
gium. For example, in describing the soup can- 
tines, she speaks of the women who had ladled 
out soup for seven hundred days without inter- 
mission. She says, "That day, a woman who 
had not before served on the soupes offered her 
services to the seasoned workers. They were 
grateful, but smilingly advised her to go home, 
fill her bath-tub with water, and ladle it out to 
repeat this the following day and the following, 
until finally she might return, ready to endure 
the work, and above all not to retard the 'Line' 
five unnecessary minutes! Two and a half years 
have not dulled the tenderness of these women 
toward the wretched ones they serve." One 
notes many touching expressions of devotion 
toward the unfortunate: the conversion, for 
instance, of the Antwerp Music Hall into a 
sewing-room for those greatly in need of employ- 
ment, where the favorite baritone "of this one-

time concert-hall comes twice a week to stand 
in the midst of the packing-cases behind his ac- 
customed footlights to sing to this audience 
driven in by disaster and to teach them the beau- 
tiful Flemish folk-songs." For the Belgians set 
great store by their astonishing sense of rhythm, 
and they still preserve their feeling for decorative 
effect. 

The conditions which Mrs. Kellogg describes 
are new to most of us. The Belgian women have 
been even more heroic than we realized, and their 
frugality, which she tells of at length, especially 
in regard to the use of foodstuffs their ability 
to "present variety from apparent uniformity"- 
is full of suggestion for the patriotic housekeeper. 

THE RELIGIOUS EDUCATION OF AX AMER- 
ICAN CITIZEN. By Francis Greenwood Pea- 
body. Macmillan; $1.25. 
The homelessness of the American boy. the 
religion of the college student, the relation of 
universities to the social conscience, American 
character, its debits and credits, the failure of 
pessimistic, institutional Christianity, all these 
topics suffer from the decrepitudes of age ; but in 
Francis Greenwood Peabody's new book they re- 
ceive a very frank, comprehensive, whole-visioned 
treatment. Dr. Peabody was something like a 
radical twenty years ago. and unlike many former 
radicals of the clergy, he is still at least a pro- 
gressive. "For one educated youth who is alien- 
ated from religion by the persuasions of science, 
philosophy, or art, ten, we may be sure, are es- 
tranged by an irrational or impracticable teaching 
of religion." "To do for others has seemed to 
the tradition of the Church a superadded and 
secondary effect of religion, rather than one of 
its essential and original factors." "Much Chris- 
tian teaching is still in effect social pessimism." 
These and much besides stamp the author as 
more than usually keen and genuine. 

Some patent defects that one grieves so often 
to find in religious writers of prominence are an 
over-reliance on pretty verbosities, a habit of glib 
mosaic of Biblical quotation designed to fit into 
modern problems (going back for its warrant to 
the infallibility of the scriptures), and a trait 
that naturally goes with the latter an odd com- 
bination of sound and serious reflection with 
ramshackle logic. But there is plenty of meat 
in this book. Chapter four, "The Universities 
and the Social Conscience," is good reading de- 
spite the opening claim that the present genera- 
tion has "discovered" the social conscience. This 
is true only in the sense that the age of Elizabeth 
discovered America. John Smith is no further 
from Columbus than the "present generation" 
from the early socialists. Chapter five, giving 
its title to the book, is also extremely suggestive. 



True, Mr. Chesterton is given credit for origin- 
ating the observation that Christianity has "nut 
been tried and found wanting, but found difficult 
and never tried." Though the words are Ches- 
terton's, Oscar Wilde, and if one mistakes not. 
Pascal before him. gave the idea currency. "The 
Conversion of Militarism" is an excellent com- 
mentary for our times on William James's sug- 
gestion of a "Moral Equivalent for War." Those 
who years ago admired "Christianity and the 
Social Crisis" as who did not? will welcome 
this book with the same satisfaction. 

BRAZIL TODAY AND TOMORROW. By L. 

G. Elliott. Macmillan; $2.25. 

Long acquaintance with, and an intimate 
knowledge of, Brazilian affairs, industrial, finan- 
cial, and commercial have equipped the author 
of this work to write not only with fulness ,,r 
fact, but also with a perspective of values not 
often found in any encyclopaedic compendium. 
It is a handbook of information culled from 
reliable sources and illustrated with many ex- 
amples drawn from a rich experience of residence 
and travel in this the largest of the American 
republics. The author is interested primarily 
in trade rather than in nature and man. He 
portrays the history of this land to whose stocks 
not only the aborigines and the best strains of 
the Portuguese and Spanish peoples have con- 
tributed but also Germans, Italians. French. 
Dutch, British, Russians, Syrians, and Japanese, 
to say nothing of the large negro element 
brought as slaves. The self-exiled Americans 
who emigrated to Brazil at the close of our Civil 
War have all vanished. The rapid rise of 
American trade and commerce has brought to 
this sister republic, however, an increasing con- 
tribution from our civilization. Lack of com- 
munication and diversity of climatic conditions 
and agricultural interests tend to isolate the na- 
tional groups, with the result that there is less 
fusion of cultures and of sentiment in Bra/il 
than in our own melting-pot. The author's 
analysis of these results of coloni/ation is par- 
ticularly illuminating in view of the present 
crisis in the provinces of the south, where Teu- 
tonic influences predominate. The greater part 
of the book deals with matters of transportation. 
industry, and finance, with internal and foreign 
rommerce, and with the problems of the develop- 
ment of the vast and as yet almost untouched 
irces of this great empire. The author is 
not blind to, nor oblivious of, the ha/anU which 
attend the utili/ation of such resources nor un- 
appreciatixe of the qualities of enterprise, re- 
sourcefulness, and skill demanded of those who 
seek to control nature in the tropics. One finds 
here a very full account of railroad de\ elopment

A SOLDIER OF FRANCE TO His MOTHER. 

Translated by Theodore Stanton. A. C. 

McClurg; $1. 

Mr. Stanton, in his Paris letter of some time 
ago to THE DIAL and in the introduction to his 
own admirable translation of these "Lettres d'un 
Soldat" has said with grace and judgment nearly 
all there is to say about this "picture of the in- 
terior of a soul." It is composed of a series of 
letters and jottings sent from a sensitive young 
artist-soldier to his mother during the period 
from August 6, 1914 to April 6, 1915, upon 
which latter day the author "disappeared." It 
must be a source of great comfort to the mother 
to feel that, after all, her son achieved in these 
letters something like complete artistic expres- 
sion of his noble nature, to know of the wide 
recognition they have had in France, and to learn 
that now they are given in English to America, 
which needs their lesson and their inspiration. 

They represent the reaction to the tedium 
and horror of war of a mind trained in artistic 
and intellectual pursuits, unused to contact with 
the sordid side even of peaceful life. One might 
suppose that such a man could reap only a sorry 
harvest of despair from out the trench mud and 
cannon shock. But he contrives so to adapt him- 
self to his new surroundings that out of his 
experiences there rise flights of spiritual song, 
renewed consecrations to a task difficult, even 
repugnant, and glorified visions of a steadfast 
faith in the ultimate good of things war in- 
cluded. 

In the autumn months of 1914, the writer 
speaks oftenest of the companionship he finds in 
Nature. His words, as they paint the scenes of 
pink and gold and blue that his brush could not 
catch, are the words of an artist ; his meditations, 
like those of Marcus Aurelius, to whom indeed 
he has been compared, are assured and tranquil, 
transcending in their sustained flight all the roar 
of guns and the cries of wounded, even all self. 
In February and March there comes a tempo- 
rary depression. There is one haunting plaint 
for the days and the way of life that he begins 
to see are no more. Then once more he mounts 
to more serene heights than he has known, where 
he learns that total self-abnegation is the sure 
way to knowledge. As M. Chevrillon says, in 
the preface to the French edition, "What counts 
for him through these weary weeks, what he loves 
to recall afterwards, what he would ever find 
again and never lose are those supreme moments 
in which he felt self-forgetfulness because he had 
felt the ineffable." 



PORFIRIO DIAZ. By David Hannay. Henry 

Holt; $2. 

The life of Porfirio Diaz is the latest addition 
to the series, "Makers of the Nineteenth Cen- 
tury." The events of the last six years might 
lead one to doubt whether Mexico is yet fully 
"made." But Mr. Hannay wisely cautions his 
readers to remember that Diaz or any other who 
would labor for the betterment of that country 
must inevitably find the average native a most 
discouraging obstacle to progress. His natural 
characteristics, mental inertness, a fondness for 
pulque, and an attachment to community life, 
three centuries of repression under the Spanish 
colonial system, and a century of exploitation at 
the hands of local caciques and military dicta- 
tors, hardly prepared him for rapid acquisition 
of culture and material prosperity at the close 
of the nineteenth century. Neither were the re- 
sources of the country adequate to the task, nor 
its physiography favorable for a united effort 
toward those desirable ends. But Diaz did his 
best, and if he wrought more rapidly than wisely, 
with more reliance upon force than upon persua- 
sion, he at least afforded his country one gener- 
ation in which exploitation took a peaceful turn. 
If this is the best that one can say for his rule, 
it is at least a welcome contrast to the half-cen- 
tury of anarchy that preceded it, or the six weary 
years of strife that have followed his exile. 

The story of Diaz's own life is a fascinating 
one. The steps by which the humble farrier's 
son became a law-student, the local political boss 
of his district, the successful general, the astute 
national politician, the leader of a successful re- 
volt (apparently a necessary step in Latin Amer- 
ica), the chief magistrate of the Republic and 
its acknowledged dictator, are told with sufficient 
clearness, and with a grasp of fundamental causes 
that makes the book doubly acceptable. One 
misses the sickening eulogies of a decade ago, 
and also the bitter tirades of more recent times, 
though the author is apparently familiar with 
both, and with contemporary life in Latin Amer- 
ica. Mr. Hannay is not sympathetic; neither is 
he savagely critical. He does not seem to have 
much hope of immediate betterment in Mexico, 
nor does he unduly blame Diaz for not training 
a successor, when such an individual must prove 
an immediate rival and break down his work 
in his own lifetime. If this actually happened, 
despite his utmost efforts to forestall such a 
catastrophe; if his material creations largely fell 
into ruins along with the heavy-handed police 
power that he exercised, it was because Diaz, 
after all, was but a man, and not the super- 
human being that imaginative writers formerly 
created for us.

N.. I i> ON N I u I'M I M.N 



"Bromley Neighborhood," by Alice Brown 
(Macmillan; $1.50), is not a story of the war, 
though, since it takes place in 1914, it must, as 
its author explains, be colored by the Great War 
"as all life will henceforth be colored forever- 
more." It is the story of such a community as 
may be found in New England and occasionally 
out of it a community shut off from the rest 
of the world as a result, not so much of geogra- 
phy as of an essential insularity of spirit. All 
its passion was spent in its youth. In comfort- 
able middle age, warmed by pride of blood and 
pride of acres, it sits, if not oblivious of, at least 
indifferent to, the world that roars outside. Au- 
tomatically, individuals narrow themselves to its 
confines grow old and mellow or old and tart 
in the charmed circle they have drawn for them- 
selves. Occasionally youth breaks away, but the 
community remains unchanged. 

The lives of the little group of families that 
compose the community called Bromley Neigh- 
borhood furnish Miss Brown with a theme that 
is almost epic. Her story is the story of a race 
of men, not of individuals. She follows the 
intertwined destinies of her characters with a 
consciousness of the past in which they are so 
firmly rooted, that is so vivid as to make the 
story seem sometimes almost symbolic, if not 
scientific a study in heredity. Halfway through 
the book, the war enters. America is not yet a 
participant ; but to all the characters in the book 
that amount to anything, the war is already 
"our" war. What Miss Brown calls the spirit 
of old New England incites them to a holy mili- 
tarism. They are ready, as their ancestors of 
yore, to give all they have for freedom for the 
Right as they see it. And their new faith, which 
takes them far beyond the narrow spiritual con- 
fines of their neighborhood, is bright enough to 
furnish light for the unravelling of tangled per- 
sonal problems. War does, after all, give indi- 
viduals a chance to save their souls. 

Perhaps the men and women of Bromley 
Neighborhood are a little too consistent, even 
for New England, where consistency is said to 
be so common a jewel as to pass unnoticed; 
perhaps Miss Brown is a shade unsympathetic 
toward those characters in whom the spirit of 
New England has shrunk and crystallized into 
something different. But on the whole, the 
people of Bromley Neighborhood are real people 
with reactions that are, on the whole, true 
deadly true. In spite of the almost ecstatic hope 
of the book, indeed because of that hope, it leaves 
the unbeliever hopeless. People will not give 
to peace the passion that they give to war. There 
are many neighborhoods whose only professed 
pacifists are men whose peace is the "peace of 



those who have convinced themselves that noth- 
ing is worth fighting for." Most of the youth 
and ardor and high purpose of the world is beinp 
spent gloriously, Miss Brown would have us 
believe in destruction. 

"Bromley Neighborhood" will be recom- 
mended as a "good" book. It is, too, a sincere 
and moving story, told with more than average 
skill. But to the unbeliever, "Bromley Neigh- 
borhood" is a depressing document, offering 
fresh proof that the day when wars shall cease 
is yet far off. 

It is not often that an American writer ven- 
tures into what may be called native material. 
Doubtless too much imagination is required to 
discern the elements of a good story in the com- 
monplace commercial life of every day, or it may 
be that too much hard work is needed to hold 
the 1 reader's attention in a story about ordinary 
people. Elaine Sterne has ventured into this 
field in "The Road of Ambition" (Britton Pub- 
lishing Company; $1.35) and has written the 
sort of story which we are glad to have from 
an American novelist. She has chosen to write 
about a laborer in the steel mills, a man with 
imagination and a passion for power. Such a 
story could have been written more effectively by 
a man, but one is willing to pass over certain 
feminisms in the discussion of business for the 
sake of the story itself, which is engrossing. To 
the credit of the author be it said that she has 
not depended on the trick of coincidence or 
chance to build a plot. She has found the ma- 
terials for plot and denouement in the characters 
of her story, just as she has found her story in 
the life of American industry, and that is as it 
should be. 

Those of us who know England have known 
since the start of the war that something fine 
and enduring would come out of the throes of 
conflict, that somehow England would emerge 
purged in spirit. Two books have been written 
thus far which indicate that this process is go- 
ing on. Both books should be read by everyone 
who wishes a sane analysis of the effects of the 
war upon individuals who have suffered actual 
experience, with some hint of the ultimate con- 
sequence socially and nationally. These books 
are Hugh Sdincourt's "A Soldier of Life" 
(Macmillan; $1.50) and Stephen McKenna's 
"Sonia: Between Two Worlds" (Doran; 
$1.50). Neither of these novels has any sug- 
<>n of Mr. Wells's pyrotechnic omniscience, 
both of them are characterized by a deep sense 
of human character and its reaction under Gar- 
gantuan crises. "A Soldier of Life" is a study 
of ;i man who has been invalided home, only to 
i\rr that the readjustment to the sweetly 
tic and complacent life of the old order is

impossible. The spiritual contrast drives him to 
the verge of insanity and it is in the working 
out of his understanding of the deeper signifi- 
cance of life that he wins sanity and happiness, 
for he discovers that it is more wonderful to live 
than to kill and that life, if it be truly lived, 
demands as great discipline, as great sacrifice as 
does war. "Sonia" is less mystical in its interest, 
perhaps more typically British for that reason. 
It is an excellent example of those novels of 
school and college life which only the English 
know how to write, perhaps because the English 
are the only ones who know how to live that life. 
But it is more than charming narration and de- 
lineation; it has a sense of the traits in British 
character which make it survive. The very qual- 
ities which appear in the public-school life, which 
make gentlemen and sportsmen, are the qualities 
which make soldiers and which later will make 
citizens of a truly democratic society. Mr. Mc- 
Kenna writes with charm and brilliance. His 
name is new to America, but this novel will place 
him well forward in that group of younger nov- 
elists who before the war had started the foun- 
dations of a new epoch in the English novel. 

No one will gainsay the publisher's statement 
on the jacket of "Saint Seductre" (by Exile X, 
Liberty Publishing Association; $1.25) that, it 
is the duty of every true American to acquaint 
himself thoroughly with each particular element 
of the Teutonic peril. The purpose of this story 
is to acquaint the American reader with a cer- 
tain element in Prussian officialism, and as such 
it offers material which ought to be borne in 
mind in whatever discussions of peace the future 
may see. The book was written in the white 
heat of intellectual conviction, rather than pas- 
sion. Terrible as is the picture of the sufferings 
of the prison camp, the emphasis is not put upon 
physical tragedy so much as upon the chicanery 
and deception of those officials whose best inter- 
ests lie with the survival of Prussianism after the 
war, even in the guise of democracy. Unfortu- 
nately the book is in the form of a dialogue and 
the average reader is unwilling to concentrate 
sufficiently to follow a narrative stripped bare of 
superfluous description or narration. But it is 
well worth anyone's time to read these short, 
terrible conversations which concern a prison- 
camp plot and its tragic culmination. To read 
this book is to gain an idea of that terrible men- 
ace, Prussianism, which when all is said and 
done has made the German people themselves, 
as well as the Allies, suffer the atrocities of war. 

Leona Dalrymple in "Kenny" (Reilly & Brit- 
ton ; $1.35) has written an American E. Temple 
Thurston novel ; and although the comparison 
between the two may not be wholly in her favor, 
it is not meant to be derogatory. For nothing 



is so difficult for an American writer, so relent- 
lessly difficult as the expression of charm in 
personality. Mr. Merwin has given us his inter- 
pretation of New York's bohemia; Miss Dal- 
rymple now gives us hers, and, to tell the truth, 
it pleases us more. The two peripatetic, mutu- 
ally adoring, ever-quarreling Irishmen, Kenny 
and his son, belong to the romantic rather than 
to the realistic world, but their wanderings and 
their ways gave us far greater delight than if 
they had stepped straight out of the Village with 
the paint of their acquired personalities still wet. 
Their personalities appear to be inbred. Their 
adventures are told with liveliness and sympathy. 
A thrilling story with a groundwork of com- 
mon sense ! Such is the impression which re- 
mains after the pleasurable excitement of reading 
Burton E. Stevenson's "A King in Babylon" 
(Small, Maynard; $1.50) has subsided. The 
story concerns a moving-picture producer and his 
determination to introduce imagination and art 
into his work. (Would to heaven that every 
scenario-writer, producer, and actor in the coun- 
try would read the stinging criticism of their 
wooden-headed efforts!) This producer used 
genuine imagination in building a plot about 
Henley's lines, 

I was a King in Babylon 

And you were a Christian Slave. 

The production carried him and his company to 
Egypt, where a suitable setting was found in a 
royal tomb practically excavated by an American 
archasologist. It is at this point that the seem- 
ingly supernatural enters into the tale, giving an 
extraordinarily weird and gripping turn to the 
story. But the author, and we hereby render him 
our thanks, instead of yielding to the easy trick 
of invoking the supernatural in order to gain his 
effect, skilfully erects a framework of logical ex- 
planation on which one may stand and enjoy the 
spectacular climax without danger of doing his 
intelligence injury. 

It is not often that a reviewer finds himself 
in a glow over an American novel, but such is 
the present writer's experience with Stuart Mac- 
lean's "Alexis" (Appleton; $1.50). When a 
reviewer finds himself in this unwonted condi- 
tion, it is difficult to explain his feeling. It does 
not suffice to say that this story has attractive 
subject-matter; many books are quite as attractive 
in this respect as this story of a music critic who 
discovers in the son of his washerwoman some- 
thing bordering on genius ; nor is it enough to say 
the story is exceptionally well written, or that the 
characters are deftly drawn, or that there is a 
lot of splendid talk about music and musicians. 
There is something beyond these qualities, per- 



282 



THE DIAL 



[September 27 



haps best defined as a sense of human warmth. 
There is between the lines an indefinable quality 
of ardor, of the eagerness and intensity of youth 
and youthful ambitions. One knows from the 
start that the story will be a happy one and that 
all will be well in the end. Fancy that the hero 
.is your own protege. With what vivid pleas- 
ure you would see him working out to success! 
That is exactly the feeling inspired by this ex- 
cellent story of music, and those who have to 
do with real music. 

"From Death to Life," by A. Apukhtin (R. 
Frank), is a charming fantasy from the brain of 
a poet little known in America. It is the tale of 
a soul's wandering, from the moment of its 
release from the body of a prince to the moment, 
a few hours later, when it found breath in the 
body of a child born to the favorite maid of the 
prince's wife. The extravagance of the central 
idea in no way detracts from one's enjoyment 
of the piece. The prose is simple and direct 
and the images are poetic. Franklin Booth sup- 
plies seven pen-and-ink drawings that help ma- 
terially to translate the spirit and delicacy of 
the little story. The slender volume is Number 
1 in a series of "Gems of Russian Literature," 
which Mr. Frank intends to bring out. 

To those who have found war too gloriously 
represented in fiction, to those who would like 
to know a few of the typical fighting men of the 
eastern and western fronts, shorn of their civ- 
ilized demeanor and expressing in action the 
purely elemental impulses, we recommend "The 
Fighting Men," by Alden Brooks (Scribner's; 
$1.35). In these stories the Parisian of the 
Boulevards is shown rallying from his acquired 
inertia to the pitch of daring that has made his 
country famous. The Russian peasant is por- 
trayed with all his faults and not a few telling 
virtues. The Belgian, the Prussian, and the 
American of the Ambulance and the Foreign 
Legion are shown very much as one would expect 
them to appear. Mr. Brooks has had the op- 
portunity of knowing his men at first hand, and 
his imagination is as fertile as it is grim. 

"Mrs. Hope's Husband," by Gelett Burgess 
(Century; $1), is a delightfully humorous com- 
edy of manners and character. We have always 
been led to believe that among the candidates for 
divine reward the wife of a genius stood high. 
We now perceive our mistake; her claim shrinks 
to insignificance beside that of the husband of a 
famous woman. How he may mitigate his suf- 
ferings is one of the things that an acquaintance 
with Mr. Hope has taught us. But more espe- 
cially would we recommend this little book to 
the flourishing Mrs. Hopes of the universe, who 
cannot, unaided, appreciate the pathetic condition 
of being a husband. 



CASUAL, COMMENT 



THE DEATH OF HENRY E. LEGLER, head of 
the Chicago Public Library, is not only a serious 
loss, but one that comes much too soon. Mr. 
Legler was only fifty-six having been born of 
Swiss-Italian parentage at Palermo, in 1861 
and should have remained a serviceable factor in 
the higher life of the community for more 
than the brief eight during which he served. But 
he never spared himself in his work, and his work 
wore him out. He was a man of initiative and 
of ideas: "Only start a thing and somehow it 
will go through" might have been his motto. He 
came to Chicago from journalistic and libran 
work in Wisconsin. His chief success here \\ as 
in the enlargement of library service through the 
extension of the branch system: it was his aim 
to "carry the book to the people." His latest 
effort was to found the movement for supplying 
our soldiers and sailors with libraries a work 
which, initiated in Chicago, has been taken up 
by the libraries and reading public all over the 
country. Mr. Legler was a finely sympathetic 
personality, beloved by his staff and deserving 
of high appreciation from a public faithfully and 
intelligently served. 

* 

A SCENT FOR SOCIAL WRONGS has been in- 
dulged once more, on a large scale, by Upton 
Sinclair. He is publishing a novel about the life, 
the work, and the surroundings of the men, 
women, and children who live in the coal-mining 
camps and earn their livelihood there. "King 
Coal" is the book's rather journalistic title. If 
this new book is as honestly and earnestly meant 
as "The Jungle," one hopes it will not have the 
same bad luck of being wrenched somewhat from 
its purpose. "The Jungle," written to expose 
human conditions "behind the yards." was taken 
as a mere sensational disclosure of repellent man- 
ufacturing processes. For interest in the worker 
there was substituted an interest in the product. 
If the same ill luck again befalls, we shall have, 
instead of the reform of serious social evils among 
our newer citizenry, only a document on the pro- 
duction and distribution of our winter's fuel a 
burning question, to be sure, but not quite the 
same as the plaint of the becoming American 
under unfair conditions in days of doubt and 
stress. 

A BOOK OF BIBLE LOVE-STORIES, in the man 
ner and idiom of "Billy" Sunday, is on the wav 
and seems calculated to arouse apprehension-. 
Mr. Sunday has arranged a series of narratives 
which deal with Ruth, Esther, Rachel, Rcbekah. 
Delilah, and other heroines of Scripture. Thev 
will doubtless have their own air. Well, other 
times, other manners; other days, other tones

and tempers. If we but concede that old tales 
must be retold for newer generations in the taste 
of the period, that old garments must be given 
a new cut and hang for the mental shoulders and 
limbs of the Latest Comers, and that novel col- 
ors and timbres are justly demanded by the hu- 
man run-of-the-mine in its newest psychical 
development the rest is easy. But Ruth pre- 
sented in the parlance of vaudeville or Esther 
squared to the taste of the bleachers well, does 
the prospect quite please? 

A SHEAF OF DIVORCE PAMPHLETS FROM ENG- 
LAND helps to remind us of the crying need of 
one social reform in Britain and of the checks 
and delays which the war is occasioning. The 
Divorce Law Reform Union still issues its leaf- 
lets and its annual reports. Its officers have been 
asked why they have not, like so many bodies 
dealing with controversial questions, accepted a 
truce and closed their doors during the great 
struggle. They reply that the chief opponents 
of the Union, those who .insist on taking the re- 
ligious (or even the ecclesiastical) view of mar- 
riage, have increased their activities against the 
extension of the divorce laws ; also, that many 
of the domestic problems raised by the war are 
a direct result of the marriage and divorce laws 
at present in force. The Union, despite the op- 
position of such tories as Lord Hugh Cecil, will 
continue, then, to present marriage in a secular 
aspect, and to promote procedures which shall 
act to assimilate British laws to those of other 
and more liberal countries, and which shall re- 
sult in making divorce easier for the poor by 
means of reduced costs and the establishment of 
local divorce courts. 



A WAR CATECHISM IN A FASHION MAGAZINE 

could scarcely fail to arrest the attention. "Do 
you believe in slavery?" the author begins ear- 
nestly. "Do you think the Germans are wrong 
or right?" and, "If wrong, would you like to 
live under German rule?" he continues. Then, 
further: "Is American blood more precious than 
French blood? If so, why? Why have the 
French women stopped dancing during the war? 
Have French women a better sense of the fit- 
ness of things than American women? If so, 
why? If your men go to the war, what are 
you going to do besides let them go?" After 
some thirty questions of like tenor, one turns the 
leaf and finds . . . ? A page of brides in full 
bridal splendor. Opposite them "the advance 
guard of the Paris openings." Close at hand 
"a continuance of straight skirts, perhaps a bit 
longer and narrower." Then pictures of "loose 
coats of green velours de laine," and so on. One 
judges that American women do believe in sla- 



very, that they are unlikely to forego the pride 
of life until the pinch of war becomes much 
more acute, and that a worldly journal of fash- 
ion and society is not the vehicle for effective 
protest against carrying the pomps and vanities 
of peace times into days of war. 



A PROTEST AGAINST THE HAPPY ENDING, as 

well as against the servile editor who would 
bestow on such termination a value and conse- 
quence hardly its due, may be found in the recent 
publication of a volume of short stories. There 
are a dozen or more of them, by different au- 
thors; and their grim and gruesome character 
has made them, despite merit, impracticable for 
the magazines as now conducted. Therefore the 
authors now sally forth in company and ask a 
general verdict from the public itself. How- 
ever, the taste of the public in stories and in 
story-endings may be got more easily and more 
conclusively than from the printed book. A few 
evenings among the films will make the point 
perfectly clear. We ask for the amiable and 
the optimistic. Perhaps not one movie story in 
a hundred "ends badly" ; our public will not 
stand it. The final turn toward happiness 
however foolish and illogical that turn, whatever 
violence it may do to likelihood or even to the 
essential character of established works of fiction 
must be accomplished somehow. Perhaps our 
associated authors are but asking that, in a world 
of clashing and cruel realities, we summon up 
enough fortitude to endure the logical and the 
true. 

WHERE WILL THE CLOSE OF THE WAR LEAVE 
BAEDEKER? The admirable guidebooks pub- 
lished at Leipzig have long been among the most 
agreeable and serviceable manifestations of the 
German spirit. With peace declared, will the 
Anglo-Saxons use them as docilely as before? 
Possibly not. Word comes that a series of Eng- 
lish "Baedekers" is projected, to be "done" by 
British editors formerly employed by the house 
of Baedeker itself. Doubtless Mr. J. F. Muir- 
head, the able author of "Baedeker's Handbook 
for the United States," will have an important 
share in the new series. Its publishers have 
acquired the rights to the travel-guides of Murray 
and of Macmillan. One trusts that the volumes 
of the new venture may be more like the Leipzig 
prototype and less in the fashion conceived by 
London: to use Murray after having used 
Baedeker was always a vexation. The first 
issues of the new series will deal' with London, 
Paris, Belgium, and Northern France. The two 
last, obviously, will be in great demand and will 
supplement the post-war tourist arrangements 
which are already being shaped by the French 
government.

hook, "Stray Leaves from Strange Literature." 
Some of the "Leaves" owe their origin to the works 
sent by Bouton to Hearn at his request. 

Two important manuscripts are owned by Mr. 
Wells. One is a sketch of Mark Twain, written 
by himself on fourteen octavo pages. At the top 
of the first page is the following note in his hand- 
writing: 

"In 'Mark Twain' Mrs. Clemens wishes you to 
ask Sam Moffett, my nephew (Editor of The New 
York Journal), to write the biographical sketch 
from these notes and then she would like to see it 
before it is printed. S. L. C." 

The manuscript is edited by Mrs. Clemens. The 
other manuscript is by Walt Whitman, is entitled 
"How I get around at 60," and is written on eleven 
octavo pages. 

Mr. Wells has also a contemporary manuscript 
of the trial in Star Chamber of John Wrenham, 
gentleman, on charges that he had alleged falsely 
that the Lord Chancellor, Sir Francis Bacon, had 
"done injustice unto His King's Majesty." The 
document is dated April 29, 1618, and is a decla- 
ration of the whole proceedings of information. It 
gives the statements of the king's counsel, Sir 
Henry Yelverton, and of John Wrenham, speeches 
of other members of the court, and the summing up 
of the case, with the court's decree. The manu- 
script is in binding by Sangorski and Sutcliffe. 
There is only one other contemporary copy of these 
proceedings, and that is in the Public Record office 
in London. The verdict was against Wrenham, 
who was fined 1000. It was also ordered that his 
ears be clipped. In 1621 charges of corruption were 
brought against Bacon, who confessed. He was 
fined, degraded, and imprisoned. 

The first sale of 1917-18 by the Anderson Auc- 
tion Company, of New York, will probably not 
take place until about November 15, owing to the 
delay in getting the old Arion Club building in 
shape for auction sales. 

Patrick F. Madigan, of New York, has just sold 
to a collector of autographs the following letter 
of Alexander Hamilton: 

Sir, 

As in our conversations on the important subject 
of a representation in the ensuing Congress I had the 
pleasure to perceive that you were inclined to pursue 
a moderate and accommodating line of conduct; and 
as I have reason to believe that representations will 
be made of the sense of this city calculated to nour- 
ish a spirit of pertinacity on the majority of the 
Assembly which may counteract the prudent views 
you entertain, I have thought it might be useful to 
possess you of a true state of facts on this head, of 
which you may make such use as you think proper. 

The general sentiments of the citizens are that the 
Senate are right in the principle for which they con- 
tend ; but a considerable number are of opinion that 
it would be better for them to depart from it than to 
hazard a loss of the seat of government for want of 
a representation on the Senate. This, however, though 
an extensive sentiment is far from being universal. 
I verily believe and I have taken great pains to as- 
certain the matter that a more considerable number 
hold that the Senate ought to persevere at every haz- 
ard. This I take to be a true account of the state of 
things here, and you may venture confidently to hold 
it up in opposition to the exaggerated stories with 



1917]

which the violent partisans will endeavor to preclude 
the possibility of accommodation. 

But if the case were in reality such as it will be 
represented to be what ought to be the inference from 
it? Will it therefore be reasonable to sacrifice the 
interests of the State to a humour utterly averse to 
all compromise or accommodation? Perhaps it may 
be supposed that in this situation of affairs the Senate 
will be induced to yield the point. I sincerely wish 
that an illusion of this kind may not be productive 
of mischief which we may all have occasion to regret. 
I flatter myself, you will believe me, Sir, when I 
assure you upon my honour that from everything I 
know of the disposition of the members of the Senate, 
I am led to conclude that the majority will in no 
event accede to the unqualified idea of a joint ballot. 
I am thus emphatical in my assurances on this point 
because I think it is of the utmost importance that 
there should be no mistake about it; and that if an 
adherence to that plan is resolved upon it- may be 
under the full impression that a representation will 
not take place. And while I make this declaration 
I cannot but flatter myself that however it may be 
imagefied that I miscalculate the firmness of the Sen- 
ate it will at least be believed that I am incapable 
of an attempt to deceive under the sanction I have 
used. 

Truly, Sir, this is a matter of serious moment. And 
allow me to hope that you will dispassionately weigh 
all the consequences of an obstinate adherence to the 
ground taken in the Assembly. I am far from wish- 
ing that house to sacrifice its dignity; but I am satis- 
fied that this cannot be the case by coming into the 
compromise we have talked of. The Senate will in 
this, as far as principle is concerned, give us more 
than the Assembly. Permit me to observe that how- 
ever violent may become certain characters, your sit- 
uation calls upon you to be an umpire between the 
zealots of all parties. You, Sir, as well as myself 
have assented to the National Constitution. Your rep- 
utation, as well as mine, is concerned that the event 
shall justify the measure and that the people shall 
have reason from experience to think we have acted 
well in making them parties to that Constitution. And 
this can only be done by pursuing such measures as 
will secure to them every advantage they can prom- 
ise themselves under it. The vanity and malignity 
of some men may be gratified by embarrassing the 
outset of the government; but this line of conduct 
would be a species of political suicide in every man 
who has in any shape given his assent to the system. 
I cannot doubt, Sir, that this observation will strike 
you as of great and real force and that you will 
readily perceive a vast dissimilitude between the sit- 
uation of those who have concurred in establishing the 
Constitution and those who have uniformly opposed. 
An alliance between these two descriptions of men 
is unnatural and if closely pursued will certainly give 
cause of repentance to the former. 

In taking the liberty to make these remarks I per- 
suade myself you will discover nothing of a dispo- 
sition unfriendly to you. I am much mistaken if we 
do not now or shall not at a future day agree on the 
prudence of the suggestions contained in this letter. I 
remain, 

Your obedient and humble servt., 

A. Hamilton.

THE 



THREE BLACK 
PENNYS 

By JOSEPH HERGESHEIMER 

408 pages, jacket in colors. $1.50 net 

This is the story, told against a developing 
background of the great American steel indus- 
try, of the three dark men of the Penny family 
and of the women they loved Ludowika, pas- 
sionate, Susan Brundon, spiritual, and Mariana 
in whom passion and spirit are blended. 

Says H. L. Mencken who read it in advance 
proofs: "It has style, distinction, repose; it 
suggests in more than one way the fine crafts- 
manship of John Galsworthy. The three men 
who are its chief characters stand out from the 
page in all the colors of life and the changing 
background behind them is washed in with ex- 
cellent art." 

GOD AND MR. WELLS 

By WILLIAM ARCHER $1.00 net 

Every one who has read H. G. Wells' GOD 
THE INVISIBLE KING will be keenly inter- 
ested in this book. 

Mr. Archer is as usual, forceful and un- 
equivocal in his handling of his subject. He 
puts the validity of Mr. Wells' Invisible King 
very much in doubt. 

PALESTINE: 

The Rebirth of an Ancient Nation 
By A. M. HYAMSON $1.50 net 

The disposition of Palestine is one of the 
questions the war must settle, and this is the 
first book in English to deal with the subject 
at any length. It tells the story of Palestine 
since the days of Rome, but is concerned chiefly 
with the present and the future of that ancient 
land, to the regeneration of which the author 
looks forward. He describes in detail the re- 
markable material progress of the past 35 years, 
and includes a brief history of the Zionist move- 
ment. The volume includes sixteen remarkable 
illustrations from photographs. 

THE DEAD HAVE NEVER DIED 

By EDWARD C. RANDALL $1.50 net 

This work presents new evidence that there is 

no death, that the dead have never died. It is 

the result of over twenty years research on 
the part of the author, whose purpose is to 
take from the human heart the aw/ul fear of 
death and to tell in a simple, straightforward 
and easily intelligible manner of the existing 
conditions in the next sphere, and of the occu- 
pation of those "dead" who are living there. 
The book will be especially interesting to those 
who have read Sir Oliver Lodge's "Raymond."

fathers and the Laws and Customs Relating 
thereto," by Hewson L. Peekc, of Sandusky, O., 
the possessor of one of the largest collections of 
books and pamphlets in the United States relating 
to inebriety. In the opening chapter on "Customs 
based on Race Source or Population," Mr. Peeke 
says: 

The drinking habits of the Dutch colonists were 
excessive. Tempered in their tastes somewhat by the 
universal brewing and drinking of beer, they did not 
use as much as the Puritans of New England, nor 
drink as deeply as the Virginia planters, but the use 
of liquor was universal. A libation was poured on 
every transaction, at every happening of the com- 
munity; in public as well as private life John Bar- 
leycorn was a witness in the drawing of a contract, 
the signing of a deed, the selling of a farm, the 
purchase of goods, the arbitration of a suit. If a 
party backed out from a contract he did not back out 
from the treat. Liquor was served at vendues and 
made the bidders expansive. It appeared at weddings, 
funerals, church openings, deacon ordainings and 
house raisings. No farm hand in haying, no sailor 
on a vessel, no workman in a mill, no cobbler, tailor, 
carpenter, mason or tinker would work without some 
strong drink or treat. 

In the chapter on "Bench and Bar," Judge Story 
is quoted as saying: 

Our intercourse is perfectly familiar and unre- 
strained and our social hours, when undisturbed with 
the labors of law, are passed in gay and frank con- 
versation which at once enlivens and instructs. We 
take no part in Washington society. We dine once 
a year with the President, and that is all. On Mon- 
days we dine together and discuss at table the ques- 
tions which are argued before us. We are great 
ascetics and even deny ourselves wine except in wet 
weather. What I say about the wine gives you our 
rule; but it does sometimes happen that the Chief 
Justice will say to me when the cloth is removed: 
"Brother Story, step to the window and see if it does 
not look like rain." And if I tell him the sun is shining 
brightly Justice Marshall will sometimes reply: "All 
the better for our jurisdiction extends over so large 
a territory that the doctrine of chances makes it cer- 
tain that it must be raining somewhere." The 
Chief was brought up on Federalism and Madeira 
and he is not the man to outgrow his early prejudices. 

In the chapter on "Church and Clergy," there is 
a letter from Cotton Mather "to ye Aged and 
Beloved Mr. John Higginson," dated September 
"ye 15, 1682," in which he says: 

There is now at sea a ship called the Welcome, 
which has on board an hundred or more of the here- 
tics and malignants called Quakers, with W. Penn, 
who is the chief scamp, at the head of them. The 
General Court has accordingly given secret orders 
to Master Malachi Huscott, of the brig Porpoise, to 
waylay the said Welcome, slyly, as near the Cape 
of Cod, as may be, and make captive the said Penn 
and his ungodly crew, so that the Lord may be glori- 
fied and not mocked on the soil of this new country 
with the heathen worship of these people. Much spoil 
can be made by selling the whole lot to Barbadoes, 
where slaves fetch good prices in rum and sugar, 
and we shall not only do the Lord great service by 
punishing the wicked but we shall make great good 
for his ministers and people. Master Huscott feels 
hopeful, and I will set down the news when the ship 
- back. Yours in ye bowels of Christ, 

Cotton Mathrr.

A new kind of adventure story is promised by 
John Lane in C. A. Robbins's "The Unholy

the author finds the personification of some one of 
the evils that human flesh is heir to.

"A Book of the Utmost Importance" 

The English -Speaking Peoples 

Their Future Relations and Joint International Obligations 

By GEORGE LOUIS BEER 

Author of "Britith Colonial Policy 1754-1765," "The Old Colonial System 1660-1754" etc. 

"Belongs to a far higher order of political literature, and possesses at this time unique 
interest. It is indeed one of the best, most original and judicious attempts to construct out of 
the political anarchy of these times new organizations. . . Mr. Beer modestly describes his 
book as a livre de circonitance dealing with an unpredictable future. It is in reality a valu- 
able addition to political science." The London Times, Literary Supplement. 

"Distinguished by such brilliantly demonstrated criticism of current political thought, by 
such unusual gifts of casuality and practical ideality that it cannot fail of recognition as a 
factor of the first importance in the molding of public opinion in this country." N. Y. Times. 

"Professor Beer, in this earnest and luminous volume, raises the question whether it is 
not about time for us to think a little about what we might, for lack of an obviously better 
term, call Pan-Anglo-Saxonism and he suggests and supports an affirmative answer with' a 
convincing wealth of citations of precedents and arguments." N. Y. Tribune. 

"The student of current movements and trends will find this to be a thoroughly consid- 
ered and authoritative outlook upon economic interrelations." Washington Evening Star. 

"Easily one of the most weighty pieces of writing about the war that has yet appeared 
in this country, and should be widely read." The Nation. 

"No better discussion of it has been offered than by George Louis Beer, long a historian 
of note. His latest volume, 'The English-Speaking Peoples' is a scholarly consideration of 
their future relations and their joint international obligations." Plain Dealer, Cleveland, O. 

"Written by an American to Americans this book may, perhaps, lay especial stress upon 
this country's viewpoint, but there is nothing of selfish partiality." Journal, Richmond, Va. 

"One of the most significant of post-war publications. I feel especially like urging on 
all who have become actively interested in or identified with the movement for The League 
to Enforce Peace to read Professor Beer's work. . . Mr. Beer's book is a great contribu- 
tion towards the study of the growth of substantial international law." Reedy's Mirror, 
St. Louis, Mo. 

"A very timely book on the subject, patriotic, its views clearly reasoned, and convincing 
in the logic of its deductions." Brooklyn Eagle. 

"Thoroughness, combined with insight and judgment, seems to mark all he handles; he 
knows the details of a movement accurately, and his focusing is admirable. . . His pres- 
ent book is likely to attain to permanency as it is a masterpiece." Graphic, Los Angeles, Cal. 

"The qualities of Mr. Beer's work the painstaking care, the scholarly presentation and 
the vigorous conviction have brought to him recognition as one of the authoritative historians 
of our country in pre-revolutionary days. These same qualities are apparent in this latest 
essay." Fourth Estate, N. Y. 

"A careful, well-balanced examination of the possibilities and probabilities bound up in 
this tremendously important question. The author sets himself outside the confines of his 
subject with great skill, taking into account not only the obligations and interests of the 
people immediately concerned, but also the future of civilization as a whole, with a fine im- 
partiality." Christian Work. 

"He has opened up a field of speculation of great interest and importance." Telegraph, 
Philadelphia, Pa. 

"Mr. Beer's book is an important contribution to the theory the book is characterized by 
it* thorough preparation of material, sequential thinking and grace of expression." America. 

THE ENGLISH-SPEAKING PEOPLES 

A plea for close political association of all the English-speaking peoples, as the logical outcome 
of their identity in language and culture, and the only security for their peaceful development.

The Coming Democracy 

By HERMANN FERNAU 



An examination. Marching and merciless of Germany's medieval dynastic and political system by the 
author of 'Because I am a German," and a demand for reforms which all civilized countries of the world 
have enjoyed for decades. 



The book is one of the most important which the war has produced." The Spectator. 
"We recommend the book to every serious reader as one of the foremost books of universal and 
permanent value thus far inspired by the great war." New York Tribune.

What the Gallant French are suffering, yet without losing Heart or Hope 

Under Fire (Le Feu) The story of a squad 

By HENRI BARBUSSE Translated from the French by FiUwater Wray 

Over 150,000 copies of the French edition already sold 



An epic description of life and battle in the trenches that in grip and calm remorseless presentation of 
fact reminds strongly of Zola's best work. 



"There is much more than the life of a squad in this brilliant and varied narrative which records or 
divines wide areas of experience. It is not a chronicle, still less a diary, but combines pictures of men 
in masses, and of individual types, moralizings, impressions, observations, episodes, into a sort of epic 
of army life from the point of view of a private soldier. . ." Frank Moore Colby in The Bookman

The fighting Soul of England finding a Voice 

A Student in Arms 

By DONALD HANKEY Killed in action at the Battle of the Somme, October 26, 1916.

or a friend who has gone or expects to go across the Atlantic to fight in France. 

Hundreds of war books tell what happens to the bodies of men in the trenches and behind the front. 
This book tells what happens to their souls and minds and is as reassuring as the others are appalling. 



"This book deserves a place beside Rupert Brooke's sonnets and "Mr. Britling Sees It Through." 
It is one of the few documents that reveal the spirit of England in a terrible crisis." The New York 
Churchman. 

"Wherever there are men at war, this is a book not only for those who fight but for those who must 
remain at home perhaps more for the latter than the former." Philadelphia Press. 
"The author is interested in the great democratic experiment of the war and its lasting and bene- 
ficial results after the war is over. He writes with mixed humor and seriousness and always with 
a warm kindliness. . . . It is wholesome and fine and human." New York Globe. Net. $1.50

Ibsen: Journeyman Dramatist 



Ibsen, like Wagner and Manet, has 
lived down his commentators, and is now 
ready to be examined and enjoyed for 
what he actually was, namely, a first-rate 
journeyman dramatist, perhaps the best 
that ever lived. Twenty years ago he was 
hymned and damned as anything and 
everything else: symbolist, seer, prophet, 
necromancer, maker of riddles, rabble- 
rouser, cheap shocker, pornographer, 
spinner of gossamer nothings. Fools be- 
labored him and fools defended him; he 
was near to being suffocated and done for 
in the fog of balderdash. I know of no 
sure cure for all the sorrows of the world, 
social, political, or aesthetic, that was not 
credited to him, read into him, forced into 
his baggage. And I know of no crime 
against virtue, good order, and the reve- 
lation of God that he was not accused of. 
The product of all this pawing and bawl- 
ing was the Ibsen legend, that fabulous 
picture of a fabulous monster, half 
Nietzsche and half Dr. Frank Crane, 
drenching the world with scandalous plat- 
itudes from a watch-tower in the chil- 
blained North. The righteous heard of 
him with creepy shudders; there was bold 
talk of denying him the use of the mails; 
he was the Gog and Magog, the Helioga- 
balus, nay, the downright Kaiser, of that 
distant and pious era. 

No such Ibsen, of course, ever really 
existed. The genuine Ibsen was anything 
but the Antichrist thus conjured up by 
impudent partisans and terrified oppo- 
nents. On the contrary, he was a man 
whose salient quality was precisely his dis- 
trust of, and disdain for, any and all such 
facile heresies; a highly respectable gen- 
tleman of the middle class, well-barbered, 
ease-loving, and careful in mind; a very 
skilful practitioner of a very exacting and 
lucrative trade; a safe and sane exponent 
of order, efficiency, honesty, and common 
sense. From end to end of his life there 



is no record that Ibsen ever wrote a single 
word or formulated a single idea that 
might not have been exposed in a news- 
paper editorial. He believed in all the 
things that the normal, law-abiding citi- 
zen of Christendom believes in, from de- 
mocracy to romantic love, and from the 
obligations of duty to the value of virtue, 
and he always gave them the best of it 
in his plays. And whenever, mistaking his 
position, someone charged him with flout- 
ing these things or with advocating some 
notion that stood in opposition to them, 
he invariably called the plaintiff to book, 
and denied vehemently that he was guilty, 
and protested bitterly that it was outrage- 
ous to fasten any such wild and naughty 
stuff upon a reputable man. 

Had he been, in truth, the extravagant 
iconoclast that a misinformed rabbinism 
tried to make him out, he would have re- 
mained, to the end of his career, a mere 
freak and blank cartridge in the theatre, 
and of no more influence than such ex- 
tremists, say, as Max Stirner, Arthur Go- 
bineau, and the Marquis de Sade. So 
long, indeed, as he was generally held to 
be such an iconoclast, he actually suffered 
that fate. But when it began to be no- 
ticed, first by other dramatists and then 
by a widening public, that his ideas, after 
all, were really not extraordinary that 
what he said, in the last analysis, was sim- 
ply what every reasonably intelligent man 
thought that his plays, for all their 
smashing air, were not actually blows at 
Christian culture when this began to be 
understood, then he began to make his 
way, and all the serious dramatists of Eu- 
rope began to imitate him. But they saw 
him, with their keener professional eyes, 
more clearly than the early and so absurd 
Ibsenites had seen him. They saw that 
he was not a brummagem prophet, but a 
play-maker of astounding skill one who 
had a new and better method to teach

them. And so, when they set out to fol- 
low him, what they imitated was not the 
imaginary mystifications that foolish fu- 
glemen had read into his dramas, but his 
direct and adept manner of clothing sim- 
ple and even self-evident arguments in un- 
usually lucid and brilliant dramatic forms 
in brief, his enormously effective tech- 
nique as a dramatist. He didn't teach 
them to think extraordinary thoughts; he 
taught them to put obvious thoughts into 
sound plays. 

All this must be plain to anyone who 
goes through his so-called social dramas 
to-day, despite the confusing memory of 
all the gabble that went about in the high 
days of the Ibsen uproar. What ideas 
does one actually find in them? Such ideas, 
first and last, as even a Harvard profes- 
sor might evolve without bursting his 
brain for example, that it is unpleasant 
and degrading for a wife to be treated as 
a mere mistress and empty-head; that pro- 
fessional patriots and town-boomers are 
frauds; that success in business usually in- 
volves doing things that a self-respecting 
man hesitates to do; that a woman who 
continues to cohabit with a syphilitic hus- 
band may expect to have defective chil- 
dren; that a joint sorrow tends to dampen 
passion in husband and wife, and so bring 
them together upon a more secure basis; 
that a neurotic and lascivious woman is 
apt to be horrified when she finds that she 
is pregnant; that a man of fifty-five or sixty 
is an ass to fall in love with a flapper of 
seventeen; that the world is barbarously 
cruel to a woman who has violated the 
seventh commandment or a man who has 
violated the eighth. If you are discon- 
tented with these summaries, then turn to 
summaries that Ibsen made himself that 
is, turn to his notes for his social dramas 
in his "Nachgelassene Schriften." Here 
you will find precisely what he was trying 
to say. Here you will find, in plain words, 
the ideas that he started from. They are, 
without exception, ideas of the utmost sim- 
plicity. There is nothing mysterious in 
them; there is not even anything new in 
them. Above all, there is no idiotic sym- 
bolism in them. They mean just what 
they say. 



As I have said, Ibsen himself was under 
no delusions about his dramas of ideas. 
He was a hard-working dramatist and a 
man of sense: he never allowed the gro- 
tesque guesses and fantasies of his advo- 
cates to corrupt the clarity of his own 
purpose. Down to the time he lost his 
mind he was then at work on "John Ga- 
briel Borkman" he never wrote a line 
that had any significance save the obvious 
one, and he never forgot for an instant 
that he was writing, not tracts, but stage 
plays. When the sentimental German 
middle classes mistook "A Doll's House" 
for a revolutionary document against mo- 
nogamy, and began grouping him with the 
preachers of free love, he was as indig- 
nant as only a respectable family man can 
be, and even agreed to write a new end- 
ing for the play in order to shut off that 
nonsense. A year later he wrote "Ghosts" 
to raise a laugh against the alarmed mor- 
alists who had swallowed the free lovers' 
error. The noise of combat continuing, he 
decided to make an end of it by burlesqu- 
ing the Ibsenites, and the result was "The 
Wild Duck," in which the chief figure is 
a sort of reductio ad absurdum of the mod- 
ern Drama Leaguer. In "The Master 
Builder" he took a holiday from social 
ideas, even the most elemental, and put 
himself into a play, shedding a salt tear 
over his lost youth. And in "Hedda Gab- 
ler," as if to confute the Ibsen talmudists 
forever, he fashioned a thumping drama 
out of the oldest, shoddiest materials of 
Sardou, Scribe, and Feuillet, nay, Meil- 
hac and Halevy, as if to prove, once and 
for all time, that he was a dramatist first 
and last, and not a windy evangelist and 
reformer, and that he could meet any 
other dramatist, however skilful, on equal 
terms, and dispose of him neatly and com- 
pletely. 

Ibsen's chief interest, from the begin- 
ning to the end of his career as a dram- 
atist, was not with the propagation of 
ethical ideas, but with the solution of aes- 
thetic problems. He was, in brief, not a 
preacher, but an artist, and not the moony 
artist of popular legend, but the alert and 
competent artist of fact, intent upon the 
technical difficulties of his business. He 
gave infinitely more thought to questions

of practical dramaturgy to getting his 
characters on and off the stage, to build- 
ing up climaxes, to calculating effects 
than he ever gave to the ideational content 
of his dramas. Almost any idea was good 
enough, so long as it could be converted 
into a conflict, and the conflict could be 
worked out straightforwardly and effec- 
tively. Read his letters and you will find 
him tremendously concerned, from the 
start, with technical difficulties and expe- 
dients and never mentioning morals, les- 
son, symbols, and that sort of thing at all. 
So early as the time he wrote "The 
League of Youth" you will find him dis- 
cussing the details of dramatic machinery 
with Dr. Georg Brandes, and laying stress 
on the fact, with no little vanity, that he 
had "accomplished the feat of doing with- 
out a single monologue, in fact without a 
single aside." A bit later he began de- 
veloping the stage direction; go through 
his plays and observe how he gradually 
increased its importance, until in the end 
it almost overshadowed the dialogue. 
And if you would get, in brief, the full 
measure of his contribution to the art of 
the drama, give hard study to "A Doll's 
House." Here, for the first time, his new 
technique was in full working. Here he 
deposed Scribe and company at one blow, 
and founded an entirely new order of 
dramaturgy. Other dramatists, long be- 
fore him, had concocted dramas of ideas 
and good ones. The idea in Augier's 
"Le Manage d'Olympe" was quite as 
sound and interesting as that in "A Doll's 
House"; the idea in Augier's "Les Ef- 
frontes" perhaps exceeded it in both ways. 
But Ibsen got into "A Doll's House" 
something that Augier and Feuillet and 
Dumas fits and all that crowd of Empire 
dramatists had never been able to get into 
their plays, and that was an air of utter 
and absolute reality, an overwhelming 
conviction, a complete concealment of the 
dramatic machinery. 

And how did he conceal it? Simply by 
leaving it out. Scribe had built up an in- 
ordinately complex dramaturgy. His 
plays were elaborate and beautiful mech- 
anisms, but still always mechanisms. He 
had to sacrifice everything else reason, 
probability, human nature to make the 



machine run. And Augier, Feuillet, and 
Dumas, better men all, followed docilely 
in his tracks. They were better observ- 
ers; they were more keenly interested in 
the actual life about them; they managed, 
despite the artificiality of their technique, 
to get some genuine human beings into 
their plays. But that technique still hung 
around their necks; they never quite got 
rid of it. But Ibsen did. In "A Doll's 
House" he threw it overboard for all 
time. Instead of a complicated plot, work- 
ing beautifully toward a foreordained 
climax, he presented a few related scenes 
in the life of a husband and wife. In- 
stead of a finely wrought fabric of sus- 
pense and emotion, nicely balanced, neatly 
hanging together, he hit upon an action 
that was all suspense and all emotion. 
And instead of carefully calculated expla- 
nations, involving the orthodox couriers 
and prattling chambermaids, he let the 
story tell itself. The result, as William 
Archer has said, "was a new order of ex- 
perience in the theatre." The audience 
that came to be pleasantly diverted by the 
old, old tricks found its nerves racked by 
a glimpse through a terrifying keyhole. 
This thing was not a stage play, but a 
scandal. It didn't caress and soothe; it 
arrested and shocked. It didn't stay dis- 
creetly on the stage; it leaped out over 
the footlights. 

The audience gasped and went out gab- 
bling, and the result was the Ibsen mad- 
ness, with its twenty years of folderol. 
But there were dramatists in the house 
who, with professional eye, saw more 
clearly what was afoot, and these drama- 
tists, once they could shake off the Scribe 
tradition, began to imitate Ibsen Jones 
and Pinero and later Shaw in England; 
Hauptmann and Sudermann in Germany; 
Gorki and many another in Russia; Her- 
vieu, Brieux, and their like in France; a 
swarm of lesser ones in Italy, Scandinavia, 
and Austria. Ibsen, in brief, completely 
overthrew the well-made play of Scribe, 
and set up the play that was a direct imi- 
tation of reality. He showed that the 
illusion was not only not helped by the 
elaborate machinery of Scribe, but was 
actually hindered that the way to sure 
and tremendous effects was by the route of 



326 



THE DIAL 



[October 11 



simplicity, naturalness, ingenuousness. In 
"A Doll's House" he abandoned all the 
old tricks save two or three; in "Ghosts" 
he made away with the rest of them, and 
even managed to do without a plot; by 
the time he got to "Little Eyolf" there 
was nothing left of the traditional dra- 
maturgy save the act divisions. It was 
not, of course, an easy reform to put 
through. The habits of mind of audi- 
ences had to be changed; the lunacies of 
the Ibsenites had to be lived down, and 
the moral ire of the anti-Ibsenites; above 
all, the actors of the time had to be 
untaught all that they knew about acting, 
and taught a lot of new things that vio- 
lated their vanity and hurt their business. 
But Ibsen's notions had logic behind them, 
and they had the force of novelty, and 
there was in them a new and superior op- 
portunity for the dramatist who really had 
something to say, and so, in the end, they 
triumphed in the world. To-day the 
methods of Scribe are so archaic that they 
excite laughter; only the Broadhursts and 
Kleins of Broadway stoop to them. If 
an intelligent dramatist were to expose a 
play built upon the plans of "Verre 
d'Eau" or "Adrienne Lecouvreur," even 
the newspaper critics would laugh at him. 
All that sort of thing now belongs to 
archaeology. 

But Ibsen, as I have said, was a drama- 
tist first and last, and not a tin-pot agitator 
and messiah. He depicted the life of his 
time and he made use of the ideas of his 
time; he had no desire to change those 
ideas, nor even, in the main, to criticize 
them. "A dramatist's business," he used 
to say, "is not to answer questions, but 
merely to ask them." He asked a ques- 
tion in "A Doll's House." He asked an- 
other, ironically, in "Ghosts." He asked 
others in "The Lady from the Sea," "The 
Wild Duck," and "Little Eyolf." In 
"The Master Builder," rising, so to speak, 
to a question of personal privilege, he 
abandoned his habit and ventured upon a 
half-answer. But is there any answer in 
"Hedda Gabler"? Surely not. The play 
is still chewed and belabored by advocates 
of this answer or that; the very lack of 
agreement shows the dramatist's neutral- 
ity. "It was not my desire," he once said, 



"to deal in this play with so-called prob- 
lems. What I wanted to do was to depict 
human beings, human emotions, and hu- 
man destinies, upon a groundwork of cer- 
tain of the social conditions and principles 
of the present day." That is to say, here is 
your state of society, here is your woman, 
here is what she does what do you think 
of it? So, again, in "Pillars of Society." 
Here is your society, here are your pil- 
lars, here are their rascalities what have 
you to say of it? Joseph Conrad, another 
great artist, once put the thing admirably. 
"My task which I am trying to achieve," 
he said, "is, by the power of the written 
word, to make you hear, to make you 
feel it is, before all, to make you see. 
That and no more, and it is everything."

The Limits of Tolerance 

Bitter thoughts are in the minds of 
members of minorities nowadays, even 
where their lips are guarded against bit- 
ter words. War breeds intolerance: its 
business is stern, and its measures are se- 
vere; with the same harsh pressure it 
drafts men to fight and shuts the mouth 
of opposition; its high enterprise demands 
concentrated cooperation and renders at 
once impossible the social laxity and bick- 
ering normal to times of peace. Freedom 
of action, of speech, even of conscience, 
all are subjected to violent shift by mili- 
tary undertaking and its regime, and as a 
result of the shift men become suddenly 
and rawly conscious of the interference 
with their custom, and, in democratic 
countries, jealously sensitive of their 
rights. Dark prophets have long been 
saying that the Allies will crush militarism 
only by becoming militaristic, that a de- 
feated Germany will seize the victor's iron 
and weld therefrom the fetters of civic 
liberty. Since the United States entered 
the war the ugly boding is swollen : where 
is our pride of free speech? where is our 
tolerance of opinion? where is our good- 
humored companionableness and partisan- 
ship without rancor? A world "safe for 
democracy" were hollow indeed if the 
safety be secured at the cost of that lib- 



1917] 



THE DIAL

erty of the individual which is democra- 
cy's soul. 

Six months of being at war, six months 
of mounting suspicions and sharpening in- 
quisition on the part of the public, of raids 
and suppressions on the part of officials, 
and of rumor of secret service astounding 
honest ears, has made every American 
realize the hitch between his peace-trained 
theory of the state's activities and its bel- 
ligerent practice. Naturally, there have 
been accusations of intolerance, and 
preaching of tolerance; certainly, too, sup- 
pression has produced cankerous in- 
growths of disloyalty. But, with it all, has 
there been (what a sane treatment calls 
for) that diagnosis of the powers and pur- 
poses of the state, in time of war, which 
shall enable us to set rational limits to tol- 
erance, preventing officials through un- 
derstanding from overstepping their 
country's need, and satisfying citizens of 
the justice of official action and the safety 
of their rights? Assuredly, the symptoms 
call for a verdict. 

In times of peace the limits of tolerance 
are defined by custom. In democracies 
laws are made and conduct is controlled 
by temporary majorities. It is the fact 
that these majorities are temporary, that 
they submit their rule periodically and 
frequently to electoral tests that define 
party strength, which gives a sense of pub- 
lic fairness and insures the equilibrium of 
the state. Furthermore, the minority has 
always at its disposal certain recognized 
means of converting itself into a major- 
ity, chief among them free speech and 
free party organization. The system thus 
rests upon the assumption of perpetual dif- 
ferences of "issues" relative to the 
control of the conduct of citizens; and in- 
deed, if these "issues" did not exist, 
democratic government would cease. An 
agreement to disagree (within limits) is 
thus the very core of institutional democ- 
racy; and the thing we call "democratic 
tolerance" is our name for the range of 
disagreement which we normally permit. 

For tolerance, even in times of peace, 
has clear limits. There are acts and con- 
ditions that cannot be tolerated and soci- 
ety still endure. We recognize readily a 



human duty to be intolerant of, and to 
suppress and extinguish even at a cost of 
force and bloodshed, crime and sin: our 
criminal code is the profession of such an 
intention. Less consciously, but more 
tyrannously, the burden of a public will is 
imposed upon the individual in multitudes 
of details of our economic and social life, 
which we bear, for the most part, com- 
fortably, as we wear collars and shoes, 
not realizing that they are fetters. All 
this is quite as it should be: if we would 
be men, we must recognize moral obliga- 
tion and acquiesce in social restraint. 

In time of war the latitudes of differ- 
ence which we permit in the midst of peace 
are stringently narrowed; and it is this 
narrowing of the latitude of action to 
which we are accustomed that stirs sensi- 
bility and arouses the jealous suspicion of 
outraged rights. Nor is war the only con- 
dition which entails such consequences; 
other perils, as pestilence and flood and 
even the humanly created discomforts 
of economic strife, call for their own 
types of limitation of privilege and read- 
justment of rights. In them all is a cer- 
tain common character : they represent, as 
compared with the normal life of society, 
a sharp simplification of social ends and 
a great compression of social endeavor. 
The presence of peril acts immediately to 
define the near and major task of the body 
politic; the complex and divergent activi- 
ties of normal times become temporarily 
but emphatically subordinated to the great 
activity of the preservation of their con- 
dition, and, as a consequence, the main 
force of society sweeps into a single chan- 
nel. Small wonder if the swollen major- 
ity becomes tyrannous, for its effort is at 
once more intense and backed by huger 
power than in the ordinary. 

Under ordinary conditions most men 
will accept as a reasonable rule of polit- 
ical conduct that opposition to the will of 
the majority should extend to its policies, 
but not to its execution of them, until the 
majority has been reversed by election. 
This is the rule of "politics," of parlia- 
mentarism; it is the assertion that laws 
are the friends of the citizen, or, with 
Aristotle, that "men should not deem it 



328 



THE DIAL 



[October 11 



slavery to live under the constitution, for 
it is their salvation." This rule, from the 
side of the government in power, is equiv- 
alent to the statement that it will tolerate 
all opposition which does not interfere 
with the execution of the tasks decided 
upon by the ruling majority. In brief, the 
range of tolerance is directly proportional 
to the demands of efficient government. 

This is the rule of political conduct in 
normal peace. In time of peril, war, or 
pestilence, it should be not different in 
principle, much as its practice must neces- 
sarily differ. But there is a complication. 
In the presence of pestilence there is an 
almost unanimous fear and willingness to 
submit to governmental guidance. War 
is man-made, and it is difficult to define its 
partisanships by national boundaries. Nor 
is its threat so transient; there is fear of 
post-bellum alterations, modifying the 
whole order of life, a fear, on the whole, 
justified by history. Men, therefore, do 
not submit to military regimentation with 
the same resignation with which they un- 
dergo sanitary regulation. Passion poi- 
sons reason; copperheadism develops into 
political disease; and, on the side of the 
government, the legitimate limitation of 
individual privilege in accordance with the 
needs of efficient action is too readily re- 
placed by a vengeful constraint, which is 
the only true intolerance. 

In the United States to-day we have not 
as yet come to a bad pass, either in regard 
to the draft or to free speech. The will 
of the majority is unambiguous; the causes 
of the war are generally felt as justifying 
causes and the government is generally be- 
lieved to be honest and competent. But 
this is not to say that we have no problem, 
nor that it is not developing. There is a 
minority, composed of the resentful igno- 
rant and the embittered opposition; and 
the majority have not invariably shown 
the tact and judgment in the exercise of 
their prerogative which would diminish 
the resentment and the ignorance. Cer- 
tainly, the condition is not malignant, but 
before it has the opportunity of becoming 
so, there is needed such clear thinking-out 
and clear expression of our national poli- 



cies as shall reassure the doubting and 
comfort the opposition with respect to that 
one point in which they are entitled to as- 
surance the preservation of their minor- 
ity rights. 

The practical problem is twofold. On 
the part of the minority it calls for indi- 
vidual self-restraint. Its members should 
remember not only that they owe all citi- 
zenship rights to the state, but that they 
owe to it their essential humanity as well; 
for, as Rousseau shrewdly remarked, not 
only is man a political animal, but he is 
never truly man except as political. From 
this it follows that human "personal lib- 
erty" is liberty of the civic person, and 
must be defined by civic relations; and 
again it follows that that relation of com- 
munication which is "freedom of speech" 
does not mean the right to unlimited hear- 
ings nor to command of the public ear. 
Further, the member of the minority 
should bear in mind that the contract 
of citizenship is not lightly drawn; it is 
signed, as it were, when the first ballot is 
cast, and its terms are such (as once more 
Rousseau notes) that the citizen binds 
himself to take what punishment the rules 
of its operation may bring upon him. He 
will remember, perhaps, that such a per- 
sonality as Socrates chose, as the lesser 
evil, to die under an unjust condemnation 
rather than break his country's laws. 
With such precepts and example he should 
not find conformity hard, provided al- 
ways that he is convinced that the other 
member to the contract is acting in good 
faith. 

The obverse of the problem is the obli- 
gation of the majority. First and clearly, 
it is the duty of the government to be 
frank as to its policies and as free as the 
performance of its task will permit in its 
statement of current fact: news-doctoring 
in the interests of policy is the straight 
road to damnation, as Germany is illus- 
trating. In living up to this duty, our gov- 
ernment at present stands square; the 
prestige which the United States has at- 
tained is almost entirely due to the frank- 
ness with which the President has stated 
our policies. Nevertheless, there is a form 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



329 



of assurance, internal rather than external, 
which the times demand and which the 
government has not given. War is an 
unusual national enterprise, calling for an 
unusual majority supporting the govern- 
ment that is waging it a majority by no 
means represented by the alignment of the 
parties of normal times of peace. In Eu- 
ropean democracies this fact has been re- 
flected in the formation of coalition min- 
istries. Our cabinet is no responsible min- 
istry; nevertheless, the obvious fact that 
the war party in America is enormously 
bulkier than the controlling political fac- 
tion ought to have been recognized 
should now be recognized by the forma- 
tion of at least a bi-partisan cabinet, com- 
prising those men of the two parties who 
most command the public confidence. The 
reason for doing this is here as in Eu- 
rope less for the conduct of the military 
enterprise than for the reassurance of the 
citizenry at home. For the best guarantee 
that our government can give, not only 
that we are engaged in war for no meanly 
political ends, but that the peace rights of 
our citizens are not to be imperilled by 
any post-bellum militarism, is the respon- 
sible participation in the national councils 
of the broadest representation possible. 
This would be a governmental pledge of 
faith. 

Thus the limits of democratic tolerance 
appear in the nature of democratic gov- 
ernment. It is not, however, out of place 
to note that Christian charity may add a 
virtue of even political value. Christian- 
ity teaches that no man in the flesh is be- 
yond hope of redemption; hence, it is 
infinitely charitable of sinners, though 
never of sin. Similarly, tolerance, as a 
virtue, extends to men, never to their mis- 
deeds; and above all, it extends to the ig- 
norance of men. Applied to the present, 
this means that we should hate injustice 
and atrocity, but not Germans. Certainly 
it is difficult to direct the emotions in ab- 
stracto, but if we can succeed in doing so 
we shall have given ourselves the deepest 
possible assurance of the security of our 
national ideals.

Literary Affairs in France 

(Special Correspondence to THE DIAL.) 
Fifty years ago the last day of last month, 
Charles Baudelaire died in Paris, where he was 
born in 1821, and consequently, in accordance 
with French law, the copyright on his works 
ended with the advent of the present month. 
So, notwithstanding the war, the poet has been 
much in evidence of late in the French publish- 
ing world, in Paris periodicals, and among the 
literary critics of the capital. It is not forgotten 
how, when some thirty years ago there began a 
tendency to apotheosize the author of the fa- 
mous, some would and do say infamous, "Fleurs 
du Mai," Brunetiere and Faguet led in the op- 
position and indulged in virulent attacks on the 
man and his verse. In "Nouveaux Pretextes," 
M. Andre Gide is considered to have refuted the 
latter, while the "Mercure de France" has dis- 
covered in an article of the "Revue des Deux 
Mondes" for June 1, 1887, an amusing blunder 
in which the always rather magisterial future 
editor of that periodical says that when Baude- 
laire wrote "Les Fleurs du Mai" he was "in 
one of those fits to which specialists have applied 
a word which never better suited the case, 
periode clownique" Brunetiere mistook clonic, 
a medical term for spasm, for the English word 
clown, used so commonly in French! 

Nor does Baudelaire to-day, a half-century 
after his death, escape from the critics, though 
for every friend and reader during his lifetime, 
he now probably has a thousand. Even M. Paul 
Souday, generally so amiable toward him, said 
recently that "there was in this poet-innovator 
a substratum of philistinism and a touch of the 
church-warden; and what is most lacking in 
his writings is manly firmness." On a single 
Paris daily, "Le Petit Bleu," are two contrib- 
utors who are especially severe in their judg- 
ment on the moral effect of Baudelaire's poems 
on the general public. "Such articles are signs 
of the time," remarks the "Mercure" somewhat 
contemptuously. One of these rather straight- 
laced censors, M. Jean Hess, considers "the 
erotic perfume of 'Les Fleurs du Mai' a ver- 
itable danger, a national peril"; while another, 
M. Jacques Nargaud, himself a poet, who some 
twenty years ago brought out at "La Plume" 
a volume of verse, "Soliloques," dedicated to 
Baudelaire, though still an ardent admirer of 
him "I collect everything I see which speaks 
of this unique poet," he once said to me dilates

[October 11 



in one of his recent articles on "the poisoned 
bouquet of 'Les Fleurs du Mai.' " But another 
contemporary French poet, M. Ernest Raynaud, 
seems to sweep aside all this depreciation when 
he informs me that he is busy on a volume "whose 
aim is to refute all the accepted lies about the 
poet." 

More interesting perhaps, or at least less apt to 
cause discussion, are some notes which I have 
accumulated concerning the various editions of 
"Les Fleurs du Mai." 

Writing me from the Paris office of the Societe 
des Poetes Francois, of which he is the vice- 
president, M. Ernest Raynaud says: 

If one considers solely the order of the poems and 
their typographical form, the only editions which 
count are those published during the lifetime of the 
poet, which he could supervise. AH the posthumous 
editions of his works have been done rather care- 
lessly. But if we are to have regard to the value of 
the documents bearing on the subject and to critical 
observations, none satisfies me completely. In the 
matter of different readings, Prince Ourousoff's work 
is interesting, while the notes of Van Bever show him 
to be a ferreter with a cautious and conscientious 
mind. But so far nothing of capital importance, noth- 
ing that is decisive, has been printed in this field of 
Baudelairiana. Most of the publishers of new edi- 
tions repeat the old faults without attempting to cor- 
rect any of them. And what a lot of foolish things 
have been said about Baudelaire, beginning with the 
famous Preface of Theophile Gautier, which might 
astonish us by its incompetency and its nonsense if 
we did not know that it was written in this way on 
purpose. Some day I may explain the true inward- 
ness of the pretended friendship between Baudelaire 
and Gautier. The whole subject of Baudelaire is so 
interesting that I have found a volume, "Le Cinquan- 
tenaire de Charles Baudelaire" (Paris: Meunier, 3 
fr. SO), necessary to present properly all that I have 
to say. At the end of the volume will be found a 
bibliography giving all the articles which I have been 
able to find concerning him and which I have made 
as complete as possible in other respects. 

To return to the question of the different edi- 
tions of Baudelaire, M. Jacques Nargaud writes 
me as follows: 

The most widely sold edition of "Les Fleurs du 
Mai" is that of Calmann-Levy, issued at the end of 
the sixties, being a volume of the Complete Works, 
which include the translations from Poe. But it is 
far from perfect from all points of view. I say noth- 
ing of the first and second editions, printed in the 
fifties by Poulet Malassis, one of which it is difficult 
to find and both of which are very costly when 
found. A little before the war, the publisher Cres 
put on the market a limited edition of "Les Fleurs 
du Mai" which has always seemed to me to be the 
best But copies of this, too, are not easy to get. The 
cheap edition just issued by Calmann-Levy is not 
handsome typographically, nor does it contain the fine 
introduction by Gautier found in the edition men- 
tioned at the beginning of this paragraph. 

Those who wish to make a serious study of Baude- 
laire should see a volume by Charles Asselineau, 
published by Lemerre but long out of print, and es- 
pecially the volume of souvenirs by Crepct, issued by 



Messeiu, which it would be hard to obtain at present, 
however, as M. Messeiu is in the army and his shop 
closed. 

The Lemerre edition of "Les Fleurs du Mai" 
appeared in the collection "Petite Bibliothequc 
Litteraire," but is now out of print, though a 
new edition is under way. "This edition, how- 
ever," M. Lemerre writes me, "is the same as 
regards the text, as that issued by my fellow- 
publisher, Calmann-Levy." I might add that this 
last mentioned book will now be largely replaced 
by the new "popular edition" issued by this same 
publisher (at 1 fr. 25) and referred to above 
by M. Nargaud. I would further add that the 
numerous little errors in the text of the first 
impression have been practically all removed 
I myself have compared with care the two im- 
pressions in the volumes now on the market. 

The National Printing Office of France set 
up a year and a half ago a rich edition of "Les 
Fleurs du Mai," partly as an official tribute to 
the memory of a great French man of letters. 
But the director informs me that copies cannot 
be obtained from him but from two Paris pub- 
lishers, Vollard, 6 rue Laffitte, and Helleu, 125 
Boulevard Saint-Germain; and the latter writes 
me in this connection: "Mine is a typographic 
edition, simply decorated, and sells at 25 francs, 
whereas the Vollard edition, which came out at 
the end of 1915, is illustrated by Bernard and 
sells for from 300 to 600 francs." But here 
again the admirers of Baudelaire and good typog- 
raphy have not been wholly satisfied, largely 
because of a faulty arrangement of some of the 
verses, the blame for which, it would seem, should 
be laid rather to the National Printing Office 
than to the publishers. But I believe that M. 
Helleu has removed these blemishes from his 
volumes. 

I may close these notes with these reflections 
of M. Andre Fontainas on some of the editions 
just mentioned: 

There are several rich editions of "Les Fleurs du 
Mai," limited as regards the number of copies printed, 
largely subscribed for in advance and quickly out of 
print. To my mind, their most striking characteristic 
is the badness of the illustrations. The truth is, it 
seems to me, that there is no really good edition of 
"Les Fleurs du Mai." Cres's edition, which was first 
published at 10 francs, now fetches, I believe, from 
80 to 100, when a copy can be found. But it, too, is 
full of faults. 

But the proverbially strong taste of the French 
for poetry has not been confined during the past 
months wholly to the dead poets, though Shake- 
speare and Baudelaire have monopolized much 
attention. Considering the all-absorbing influ-

ences of the war, much new verse has been pro- 
duced ; and none of the singers has surpassed M. 
Paul Fort, the "Prince of Poets," at least as re- 
gards quantity. 

M. Paul Fort's most recent volume is "Si 
Peau d'Ane m'etait conte" (Paris: Emile- 
Paul, 3 fr. 50), described by the author as 
"tales, written in war time, for Jacques Bon- 
homme," with this pretty thought forming the 
whole of the author's preface: "In this book of 
fairy tales and poems, the only fairy is the au- 
thor's imagination." From Maeterlinck's pref- 
ace, which the literary world on both sides of 
the Atlantic should meditate, I take these lines: 

Paul Fort is perhaps the only complete poet we 
possess, . . . which is at once his glory and his mis- 
fortune. He can only write poetry and can do noth- 
ing else. So he publishes one after the other, with 
disastrous abundance, a dozen or more volumes. . . 
It is high time that he were given, while still alive, 
the glory that is his due. We shall not have him 
always among us, and the remorse and amends will 
come when it is too late. 

Maeterlinck does not exaggerate Paul Fort's 
excessive literary productivity. Besides the vol- 
ume just mentioned, he has published during the 
present year "Anthologie des Ballades Franchises" 
(Paris: Mercure de France, 4 fr.), selections 
from twenty volumes issued during a period of 
twenty years, from 1897 to 1917; "Poemes de 
France," which he calls "my lyrical war bulle- 
tin" ; and "Deux Chaumieres au Pays de 1'Yvel- 
ine." These last two volumes I have not seen. 
In the meantime, he has been preparing for, or 
seeing through, the press three other volumes. In 
October will appear "Que j'ai de plaisir d'etre 
Frangais," about which he writes me: 

I have just corrected the proofs. To express my 
intense love for France, I took as the subject of this 
new book the three trips which I have made in Tou- 
raine and to Blois and Vendome, which are as decid- 
edly French as are the He de France, Champagne, 
and Picardy, about which I have sung a thousand 
times. 

In November will appear "L'Alouette," a vol- 
ume made up of popular songs, "or at least songs 
written in the note of the old Gallic ballads." 
The poet thus describes the volume which he 
expects to have out in January: 

At the present moment I am giving the last touches to 
"La Lanterne de Priollet ou 1'Epopee du Luxembourg," 
in which I recount my childhood and adolescence, the 
awakening in me of a soul for poetry. I there affirm 
the "divinity" of children and tell all my love for 
that garden of gardens, our fairy Luxembourg, where 
more than at school I was formed, found myself, and 
discovered that I was a poet. 

So you see that though a soldier, an auxiliary, I 
have not been idle with my pen these last months, 
for two good reasons: first, because I like to sing, and 



secondly, because I must live, and I am a poet, noth- 
ing but a poet. War doesn't bring gold to the pockets 
of troubadours. In France, if they would live even 
modestly, they must sing, and it is all the worse for 
them if they do not always feel in a singing mood, 
which often happens to me. So don't be astonished at 
the number of volumes. I must live! 

Thus during 1917, M. Paul Fort will have 
printed or finished in manuscript not less than 
seven volumes, not to speak of two others which 
one of his publishers announces as "being under 
way." This almost equals the elder Alexandre 
Dumas, with the marked difference however that 
Paul Fort has not a basement-full of "collabora- 
tors" preparing novels which "the master" simply 
touches up. No wonder, therefore, that so far 
in his career, Paul Fort has had to have half a 
dozen different publishers.

Mr. Howells and the Anglophobe 

WILLIAM DEAN HOWELLS: A STUDY OF THE 
ACHIEVEMENT OF A LITERARY ARTIST. By Alex- 
ander Harvey. (B. W. Huebsch; $1.50.) 

Mr. Alexander Harvey writes some two 
hundred and sixty pages of jottings about Chin- 
gachgook, Mr. W. C. Brownell, Edgar Allan 
Poe, the late Charles Francis Adams, Philistin- 
ism, Genius, Boston, Woman, Quackery in 
Literature, and a host of other Cabbages and 
Kings, all of them so equally and energetically 
dealt with that it is more than a little difficult to 
tell the Cabbages from the Kings. Having fin- 
ished the collection, he has the whimsical thought 
to call it "William Dean Howells: A Study of 
the Achievement of a Literary Artist." No 
sooner thought than done: to have a thought is, 
for Mr. Harvey, to execute it. The result, so 
far as the relation to a nominal subject is con- 
cerned, is a critical counterpart of "The Life 
and Opinions of Tristram Shandy." This is 
slightly exaggerated, of course, Mr. Harvey 
would be the last person to mind that, but it 
is the truth that is exaggerated. The author's 
text is not so much a book as a tirade, not so 
much a tirade as a miscellany, and not so much 
a miscellany as the preface to an index. 

For Mr. Harvey has his own idea of indexes, 
as of most else: he has "long suffered at the 
hands of the makers of indexes," and he strives 
to "give those hacks a lead." One may cite 
selectively, to show both his idea of "thunder in

the index" and the pet aversion on which his 
book hinges: 

BRITONS, IMBECILITIES OF THE. A large topic! I can 
do no more than glance at it. I ought to say in fair- 
ness that I dislike Britons heartily, although it is true 
that they have many noble qualities. 

LONDON. Its pontifically final attitude to ourselves 
in literature. 

MISSISSIPPI. That sublime river is mentioned by 
way of illustration. In the average index the name 
would be set down and a number would follow it. 
This is too absurd. Such are the consequences of 
following a British literary example. 

NOVEL. It deteriorates in the British Isles. 

VICTORIANS, THOSE. Confound them! 

This cluster of items will suggest that Mr. 
Harvey has undertaken to prove himself the 
most implacable of Anglophobes. His book is an 
indictment of "the British literary superstition," 
as he calls it, and as Mr. Howells called it a 
quarter of a century before him. The British 
literary superstition is that perverse humility 
which induces American newspapers, critics, pro- 
fessors, schools, and the great American public 
to swallow all literary opinions imported from 
London, and to despise all things American until 
they have the pontifical sanction of the British 
Isles. It is, as described by Mr. Harvey, our 
imbecile deference to the artistic prejudices of a 
nation incapable of art, a nation of non-thinkers 
and sentimentalists, wrapped in impenetrable self- 
esteem and childishly enthralled by a national 
literature which is the laughingstock of Europe. 
The English are pitiable because of their pre- 
tensions to literary judgment; we Americans are 
pitiable because of our deference to the English 
pretensions. Such is the main thesis; and the 
book is written primarily to undermine our defer- 
ence by riddling the pretensions. Mr. Howells, 
the most American and at the same time the 
grandest and most spacious phenomenon we have 
produced in letters, is used as a mere handle to 
the argument. 

Now, the American Anglophobe, whether he 
realizes it or not, and Mr. Harvey often seems 
not to realize it, is in a pretty difficult position. 
Whether his general estimate of British taste be 
right or wrong, he never escapes the weakness 
of having to relate everything to an aversion. 
The centre of his cosmos is a dislike; by that 
dislike he measures and evaluates everything 
else ; in it he moves and has his being. He likes 
things, not for what they are, but for what they 
are against. We feel this weakness in Mr. Har- 
vey. His praise of Howells is unstinted, extrava- 
gant, a measure pressed down and running over. 
Howells is the greatest living master of fiction; 



he is the consummate stylist; he creates women 
as great as Shakespeare's; his dialogue is un- 
matched; he is superior to Thackeray, Balzac, 
George Eliot, Meredith, Dostoevsky; he has 
the ultimate magic as a narrator; he maintains 
"that perfect balance of all factors which is the 
secret of the equilibrium of the universe." Yet 
somehow the superlatives ring strangely hollow. 
Because Howells is praised and overpraised to 
serve a vindictive ulterior purpose, this very 
enthusiasm of the critic does more to belittle him 
than even a very temperate estimate could do if 
it were disinterested. 

But this is by no means the most serious 
dilemma of the American Anglophobe who makes 
the brunt of his argument fall on Mr. Howells. 
It happens that, of the three generations of Ang- 
lophobia represented by Poe, Howells, and Mr. 
Harvey, only the second is really American. 
Poe had no anchorage in either space or time: 
he was almost strictly extramundane. Anglo- 
phobes of the younger generation are cosmopoli- 
tan; they arc anti-English simply because they 
are anti-provincial. But Mr. Howells happens 
really to believe in and love America. He is 
alone among Anglophobes in that he definitely 
chooses one kind of provincialism, which is 
American, against another kind, which is Eng- 
lish. All the rest choose cosmopolitanism against 
provincialism in general ; and when they make of 
Mr. Howells their heaviest bludgeon, merely be- 
cause he has agreed with them so far as to 
denounce the British literary superstition, they 
commit strange distortions and fall into strange 
inconsistencies. 

Here is Mr. Harvey, for example. He likes 
America best when he is thinking about England 
because America is not England. But when 
he looks at America directly, she fails to stand 
the test of his exacting cosmopolitan standards. 
It is a rather pathetically homeless state of mind, 
this cosmopolitan skepticism. Its loyalty to one 
tradition is based on distrust of another; and 
yet its own tradition seems not to bear analysis 
any better than the other does. Mr. Harvey 
is rather like an atheist becoming a member of 
the English Church out of pure temperamental 
aversion to Dissenters. America is not England : 
therefore it must be Utopia. But, on second 
thought, America is Philistinism ; America is the 
American newspaper; America is critical taste 
dictated by an advertising policy; America is 
the Victorian family system ; America is Boston ; 
America is the New England conscience; Amer- 



1917]

ica is a vile subservience to British literary pre- 
judices: therefore America is not fit to live in. 

Not even in direct treatment of Mr. Howells, 
idolatrous as his treatment is, can Mr. Harvey 
wriggle free of such contradictions. On one page 
Howells is the supreme artist. On another, "the 
art of Howells is barren"; it is "art and nothing 
more." "Howells will not be superseded because 
there is nothing about him to supersede. He has 
not made anything original even in the way of a 
mistake." We hear Howells praised for having 
read the inmost soul of America; then we hear 
America scorned for having no soul, nothing but 
surface. In one passage, "his knowledge of 
character is manifest in his feminine portraits 
. . . he has a precious insight into the heart 
of woman. . . the art with which their souls 
are bared to us is the authentic art that has come 
down to us through the few masters of the 
written word." Here, of course, Mr. Harvey 
is thinking of Howells's superiority to British 
novelists. Later, though, "the genius of Howells 
is objective and not subjective. . . He does 
not think. He merely observes and jots down 
impressions. . . Topography, objects, mate- 
rial items, are his all in all. He does not get 
below these physical manifestations of life to the 
life itself, the essence, the soul." And, crime 
of crimes, he has created and sponsored the "Sissy 
School." He, more than any other one writer, 
has rendered contemporary American literature 
a thin syrup, perfumed to a feminized taste." 

Thus, throughout, Mr. Harvey tries to have 
his cake and eat it too. Hills are marched up 
and then marched down again; superlatives deny 
each other with crushing emphasis. And, to 
palliate the inconsistencies, there is nothing 
whatever except a well-worn ruse of that very 
academicism which the author himself denounces 
on suitable occasions: namely, the barren dis- 
tinction between the "art" in fiction and the 
substance. As though there could be any great 
art except that which leans on great truth ! 

After all, one likes Mr. Harvey, who writes a 
preface to an index, a great deal better than one 
likes Dr. Dryasdust, who only writes an index 
to an index. Mr. Harvey diverts even while he 
irritates; and often he is unsurpassably acute, as 
when he says: "The supreme object of the earthly 
existence of men and women in a Howells atmos- 
phere is to have things go on as usual. There is 
an agitating possibility that they may not." We 
ask for bread and are given by no means a 
stone, but, let us say, a cocktail. The alert 



reader of the book can extend and amplify this 
analogy for himself. Suffice it to add, the bread 
which Mr. Harvey might have given us is a 
generous recognition of the extent to which all 
literature, including the British, is being Euro- 
peanized. Whatever English fiction has been, 
it is to-day integral with a world tendency. One 
of the great achievements of Howells was his 
revolt against the narrow obtuseness and self- 
love of British fiction when those qualities really 
had a threatening prestige. But the last two de- 
cades have seen Britain's fiction broadened, inter- 
nationalized in both method and purport. All 
intellectual Britain revolts against its own former 
obscurantism ; and when we look about our world 
for the positive and constructive Anglophobe 
who has the strongest claim to our notice, lo! 
he is none other than the British novelist of the 
younger generation.

'Patriotism and the Workers 

THE RESTORATION OF TRADE-UNION CONDITIONS. 
By Sidney Webb. (B. W. Huebsch; 50 cts.) 
WOMEN AS MUNITION MAKERS. By Amy Hewes 
and Henriette R. Walter. (Russell Sage Foun- 
dation; 75 cts.) 

The present war must be won in field and fac- 
tory before it can be won in the trenches. An 
army has become, as never before, only the out- 
ermost point or apex of a pyramid of organiza- 
tion of which the base is the country's industrial 
and agrarian system. The maker of victory is 
the laborer far more than the soldier. 

That this remark has become a commonplace 
does not relieve one of the necessity of re- 
peating it, and still repeating it, and repeat- 
ing it again. For it is a commonplace which 
the manufacturer and contractor have regarded 
thus far as defining only the duty which the 
workman owes; and they have denied and 
ignored the duty which they and the government 
owe the workman. Already his assertion of his 
just rights, of what are, indeed, the indispensable 
conditions of his effective serving, are met with 
"slacker," and "disloyal," "pro-German," while 
the attempt properly to tax war profits has failed 
and that extraordinary piece of impudence, the 
petition of a group of manufacturers which de- 
clares that the workman is not meeting his re- 
sponsibilities, and that his demands for better 
wages and right shop-standards should be force- 
fully restrained and arrested, is regarded as 



334 



THE DIAL 



[October 11 



"patriotic." In wartime, as always, that is "pat- 
triotic" which decorously cloaks one's private 
interest under pleas for the public weal, and that 
is disloyal or "pro-German" which is likely to 
interfere with one's private interests, even when 
it most successfully serves the commonwealth. 

Hence, the fact that the basic maker of vic- 
tory is the laborer in field and factory has not 
resulted in the improvement of the conditions of 
production of food and weapons to which it 
points. The whole country is solicitous about 
the health, the happiness, and the future of the 
soldier. He is guarded against disease, against 
unnecessary fatigue, and if the insurance bill is 
passed, as it should be, against the hazards of 
battle and death. Not so the workman. He is 
left to shift for himself, to conduct his rather 
blind and ill-conceived strikes, to meet fatigue 
and disease and maiming and death as best he 
may. The German government, whom we are 
fighting, has known better. Its military ruth- 
lessness abroad is grounded upon its industrial 
considerateness at home, and it has held out so 
long precisely because it has guarded its work- 
ing masses against fatigue and disease and maim- 
ing and death. But the German government is 
an autocracy, responsible to no one, and may act 
as it will. So it not infrequently deviates into 
intelligence. The governments of England and 
of the United States, being of democratic consti- 
tution, act as they must, and the compulsion upon 
them is very various public opinion, the inertia 
and circumlocution of departmental tradition, 
the interests of the "invisible government," and, 
per accidens, also intelligence. Mostly, how- 
ever, democratic governments learn only by the 
method of trial and error. They have short 
memories and cannot easily profit by the past, 
particularly if the past is not their own. They 
are consequently wasteful of treasure, life, and 
time you need only regard the history of Eng- 
land in this war to realize how much and how 
stupidly. Those who desire consolation may 
consider the idea that democracies are built for 
comfort, not for speed. . . 

The record of the handling of labor in Eng- 
land for the period of the war is a characteristic 
piece of British muddling. The history of labor 
in the United States since this country entered 
the war is a characteristic piece of American 
thoughtlessness. There was, and there is, the 
example of England before the public officials 
and the private industrial magnates; there were 
and there are before them the various findings 



of the Health of Munition Workers Committee ; 
also the various reports of the Chief Factory 
Inspector. They were aware of the remarkable 
document on which the Supreme Court of the 
United States sustained the Oregon Eight Hour 
Law; they were aware of the varied testimony 
of the efficiency experts of America. But they 
went their own way, regardless, with the con- 
sequence that there have been more strikes in 
the three months past than in the last three years; 
delay instead of promptness, inferior work instead 
of excellence, disorder instead of order, and dis- 
content instead of cooperation. And as we shall 
be deeper in before we are farther out of this 
war, the future looks promising. 

Britain's handling of the labor situation is on 
a par with her handling of the Gallipoli cam- 
paign. But Gallipoli is a costly error which 
may be retrieved, while there is a "no thorough- 
fare" at the end of all the ways with which the 
British government has dealt with its labor prob- 
lem up to the present. When the war came 
trade-unions in England had a strong and pe- 
culiarly influential position. They had achieved 
power in politics and their relations with the 
employing class were governed by what Mr. 
Webb describes as "a complicated network of 
usages and regulations, differing from district to 
district, and often from establishment to estab- 
lishment." These had grown up as "necessary 
defences against a progressive degradation of 
their standard of life," and their role in the in- 
dustry of the nation was like that of the British 
constitution in the political affairs of the nation 
a very complicated, unwritten tradition, the 
winnings of a struggle between the possessing 
and the dispossessed, and the palladium of such 
liberties, industrial or political, as Englishmen 
currently chose to secure and to defend. War 
found England altogether unprepared for its exi- 
gencies, and her industrial unpreparedness was 
worse than her military. War compelled, there- 
fore, an industrial reorganization of England, a 
reorganization, Mr. Webb declares, tantamount 
to a revolution. Nothing less could have served 
to bring production to the point where the enemy 
could be met, at least, on equal terms. A revo- 
lution accordingly took place. The trade-union 
network was swept away; labor was "diluted"; 
non-union women workers and unskilled men 
were set to work; single processes were broken 
up into parts and given to separate workers; 
automatic machinery was introduced ; the hours 
of labor were lengthened; holidays were abol- 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



335 



ished; machinery was sped up. The industrial 
organization of England was, as one trade-union- 
ist put it, Americanized. 

This was done with the good will and consent 
of the whole British labor organization. At a 
stroke it sacrificed for the good of the nation, the 
hard winnings of three-quarters of a century of 
industrial conflict. All that it required in return 
was, as Mr. Montagu, then Minister of Muni- 
tions, said in the House of Commons on August 
15, 1916, "a scrupulous record and recognition 
of what they were conceding." This was prom- 
ised them, and more, by minister after minister. 
The "more" was a pledge completely and abso- 
lutely to restore trade-union conditions after the 
war. And an act of Parliament made the prom- 
ise the promise of the nation. 

It is not a promise that can be kept. British 
industry, both war and non-war industry, has 
been completely transformed. The new ma- 
chines, the use of piecework, the standardization 
of processes, the great increase in new labor, 
which will remain in the field after the war, all 
mean a new situation which the old "trade-union 
network" can neither meet nor control. More- 
over, in spite of the many solemn promises, the 
record of the customs, usages, and standards abol- 
ished has in most instances been very laxly kept, 
in some instances not kept at all. The ministry of 
munitions has been tender about compelling em- 
ployers to abide by this part of their contract. It 
seemed to hold in its mind's eye heaped-up moun- 
tains of munitions, and gave little thought to the 
quality of human nature which heaps such moun- 
tains up. The Munitions of War Act had "pro- 
hibited strikes and lockouts in war industries," 
writes Miss Walter, "and substituted compul- 
sory arbitration." Workmen were required to 
show "certificates of discharge" from their em- 
ployers and were subject to trial by local muni- 
tions committees for anything "tending to re- 
strict production." There ensued a heyday of 
exploitation by profiteers. 

This was followed by the inevitable conse- 
quences. Workers could not be recruited and 
held in sufficient numbers to insure an adequate 
supply of munitions; while those at work 
"slacked," missed days, and otherwise fell short. 
Finally, in September, 1915, there was appointed, 
under the Ministry of Munitions, the Health of 
Munition Workers Committee, with Sir George 
Newman as chairman. Its findings are grouped 
by Miss Walter under five heads hours of la- 



bor, health and hygiene, general welfare, employ- 
ment of women, juvenile employment. 

The findings are the expected. That exces- 
sive hours, continuous labor, overtime, night 
work, all decrease the output, while shorter 
hours, with appropriate periods of rest, increase 
it. That fatigue, accumulated, retards produc- 
tion, spoils work, causes accidents, sickness, lost 
time, and staleness, and that it was the cause 
of much that the employers denounced as slack- 
ing. That accidents are due also to unguarded 
machinery, the lack of safety appliances, absence 
of regulation of dangerous processes, inadequate 
lighting, dirty machinery, uninstructed employees. 
That disease is also due to inadequate attention 
to slight wounds and abrasions, to insufficient 
protection against poisonous material, and to the 
lack of proper washing facilities, ventilation, 
heating, and lighting. That output depends on 
good housing, easy transportation, proper nour- 
ishment, humane incentives to work. That the 
existence of right conditions is indispensable 
where women and children are employed. The 
report may be summarized as pointing out that 
the human machine at work is at least no worse 
than other machines, that it is, like other ma- 
chines, subject to deterioration and wastage, and 
that it consequently should have at least the 
same constant, careful examination and repair 
as the others if it is to be kept at maximum 
utility. 

But there is this unhappy paradox: human be- 
ings are not merely machines. That is why they 
get worse treatment, and are, in addition, blamed 
for not doing so well as machines. Hence, al- 
though the Newman committee did its work 
thoroughly, its effect has not been great. There 
has been some improvement, but things are very 
much as they were, and, as is usual in such mat- 
ters, are likely to grow worse rather than better. 
The English government has organized its indus- 
tries, but it has alienated the workers. It has 
failed even to maintain the human part of the 
industrial machine at adequate efficiency. It has 
made the workers a pledge that it cannot keep 
after having received at their hands the greatest 
sacrifice to national welfare that any social class 
has yet made. There is distrust in England, and 
when the war is over there will be worse. "Up 
and down the country," says Mr. Webb, "the 
workmen will be very angry. . . In every branch 
meeting ... at every labor conference, the tale 
will be discussed of how, when the government 
was in a hole, and the employers were eager for 



336

war profits, the opportunity was taken to play 
upon the workmen's patriotic feelings to induce 
them to make what the responsible minister de- 
scribed as perhaps as great a sacrifice as has ever 
been asked of any community ; of how the Trade- 
Union Leaders, in the name of the workmen 
. . . made this sacrifice ... in reliance on the 
pledge of the government and the employers 
that the 'pre-war conditions' . . . would in 
their integrity be restored; and of how, when 
the time came, the nation and the employers, hav- 
ing secured all the advantages, broke their word, 
and the workmen found themselves done!" 

War, in a word, cannot go on forever, and no 
state, not even the German, can live by war 
alone. The democracy for which the world must 
be made safe is industrial democracy even more 
than other kinds, and the British way of making 
the world safe for democracy in industry has too 
close a family resemblance to Jonathan Swift's 
solution of the Irish problem. England may, of 
course, go on muddling. The authorities may, 
Mr. Webb suggests, deceive the workmen. They 
may effect a sham restoration, and so intensify 
the class war, keep real wages down, and put a 
premium on the practice of "ca 1 canny" or limit- 
ing the output. Both employees and employers 
will suffer, and the country will suffer. 

The way deeper in is here obviously not at all 
the way out. The way out is another way alto- 
gether. It is the way of a return to first prin- 
ciples, and first principles demand a reconsider- 
ation of the motives and energies of human life 
and the value of the machinery of society in 
enlarging and perfecting them. Mr. Webb's 
proposals consequently derive from an implicit 
and daring assumption that working people are 
men and women first and carpenters, or ladlers, 
or cartridge-fillers afterward, and that they be- 
come the latter in order to preserve the former. 
They want, in a word, to live, to express their 
spontaneous energies, to find happiness. To do 
this well, they must be insured against unem- 
ployment, against destruction of their standards 
of life, against assault on their collective inter- 
ests. And they must be guaranteed the right to 
strike. Their livings, in short, must serve to 
emphasize their lives. This is really what trade- 
unionism aims at. 

Against this need is the employers' demand 
for "a progressive increase in industrial effi- 
ciency." Sir George Newman's committee has 
shown that far from being opposed, these two 
interests are interdependent. To secure the max- 



imum to both Mr. Webb suggests a new indus- 
trial charter to replace the unrestorable "trade- 
union network." The first article of such a 
charter is the prevention of unemployment 
through such a programme of public work, cov- 
ering the first decade after the war, "as will 
maintain approximately level from year to year 
the aggregate wage total of the kingdom." The 
second is the maintenance of standard rates of 
wages. The third is a constitution for factory 
and industry, involving in principle and in or- 
ganization industrial democracy within a given 
trade. The fourth is the result of the first three 
the abolition of "ca' canny." The fifth is the 
freedom of men and women to enter or leave 
trades, with the public guarantee of skilled 
craftsmen against unemployment and against re- 
duction of standards. 

Such is Mr. Webb's modest proposal mod- 
est, this time, not in Dr. Swift's sense. 

What bearing have this proposal and the con- 
ditions that evoked it upon the wartime indus- 
trial situation in America? Here industrial 
conditions are in many respects very different from 
those in England, and American trade-unionism 
differs from British both in influence and in vigor. 

In England the political action of organized 
labor is direct ; in America it is indirect. Ameri- 
can labor organizations are without the English 
experience in cooperation, productive and distrib- 
utive, in the significance and value of education, 
in political insight. The American trade-union 
is still a very primitive thing merely a battle- 
formation in the class war, designed to wrest 
better wages, hours, and working conditions 
from the employing classes. It is not, as it is 
in so many cases in England, an agency in the 
creative reorganization of the workman's life. 
It is without responsibility in the industry 
which it serves, without traditions, and not so 
resistant to innovation. Thus, "efficiency engi- 
neering," unknown in England until the war, 
is an American profession, and plants like the 
Ford or the Franklin are primarily American 
phenomena. Trade-unionism is still far from 
being what it should be in American industry 
an automatically accepted constituent in the 
country's industrial life. The primitivism of 
union organization in America is a limitation, 
but a limitation which is also an opportu- 
nity. 

The evil effect of the limitation showed itself 
in the munitions works in Bridgeport, Connecti- 
cut. Although Miss Hewes's study is confined

to the subject of women as munition-makers, its 
social and economic findings apply generally. It 
is a study limited in scope because the authori- 
ties at the plant refused the Russell Sage Foun- 
dation permission to make an exhaustive study 
of the industrial situation in the plant. When 
such a study as could be made "was submitted 
in manuscript in advance of publication, to 
officials of the Remington Arms-Union Metallic 
Cartridge Company for their criticism ..." 
they suggested "that no study could be accurate 
which was not based on data obtained in the 
plant itself." Thereupon, once more, "the Foun- 
dation offered to make a supplementary inquiry 
before publishing the report. This offer was 
refused." The findings of the report show why. 

Conditions in Bridgeport during the summer 
of 1916 echoed "those under which English 
women worked for the first year or more of the 
war with such bad effects upon themselves and 
upon efficiency of production.^' In the summer 
of 1915, when war orders began to accumulate 
and "rumors of fabulous war profits" spread, a 
series of strikes established, "in spite of strong 
opposition of the Manufacturers' Association of 
Bridgeport," the eight-hour day and higher 
wages. But the unions were not strong enough 
to enforce a closed shop, and night work was on 
the increase. 

The lure of higher pay, however, made of 
Bridgeport a boom town and brought upon the 
heads of its administration all the problems of 
housing, sanitation, education, recreation, and so 
on, that a boom town creates. Everything went 
up with the wages, and far outdistanced them, 
so that in effect, the actual wage of the workers 
was lower, not higher, than before the boom. 

In the shops, moreover, accident-prevention 
has not gone far enough; mutilation and indus- 
trial poisoning were frequent. Said one muti- 
lated girl: "I often had to complain about that 
machine, but they didn't put guards on it until 
after I was hurt." There was little regard, it will 
be noted, for the need of safety appliances. For 
sanitary precautions there seems to have been 
less: "One worker employed in a process in 
which she handled fulminate reported that em- 
ployees in her department were forbidden to 
wash their hands until after the factory whistle 
blew for dismissal, and that the only washing fa- 
cilities were long troughs with a number of 
spigots. She also said that no towels were pro- 
vided." 

Nor was the eight-hour day long retained. 



The women in the factories were "unable to 
offer effective resistance when little by little they 
were robbed of the gift [the eight-hour day], 
their schedules of working hours being modified, 
first by frequent overtime, and later by the com- 
pany's regarding this overtime as part of the reg- 
ular daily hours." In many instances the period 
for luncheon was fifteen minutes, and was not 
lengthened when the eight-hour, was dishonestly 
changed to a ten-hour, schedule. 

And the workers were also defrauded of their 
higher wages. "When once the larger force was 
organized, the eight-hour day was gradually 
lengthened. So, during the summer of 1916, 
the management appeared to be engaged in the 
policy of reducing rates of pay. 'We used to 
get \2 l / 2 cents a thousand,' said an inspector, 
'and that certainly did make slick pay for a girl. 
But now they only give us nine cents for the 
same work.' Even where piece rates were not 
reduced, the tremendous speed at which the 
machinery was driven, according to the testi- 
mony of many of the girls, so injured the ma- 
chines that they could not turn out as much as 
they used to." Only the lifeless machines were 
repaired when they were injured. 

The upshot of the boom, thus, was, primarily 
and chiefly, the exploitation of the workers, and 
the deterioration of the town and its inhabitants. 
Here, however, the citizens of Bridgeport took 
a hand. "The merchants and manufacturers, 
the educators and the physicians, the Chamber 
of Commerce, civic and philanthropic associa- 
tions united for action. They got expert advice 
and went to work." A bond issue was sanc- 
tioned by popular vote for a budget covering the 
items of education, public safety, sanitation, 
streets, roads, and parks. A recreation and hous- 
ing commission was appointed, and the Bridge- 
port Housing Company was formed. Nothing, 
however, could be done to improve the indus- 
trial conditions. "Women still work at night 
. . . and protection against accident and indus- 
trial disease in munition shops is still inadequate, 
as is the amount of compensation for disability 
due to industry." 

The industrial situation in Bridgeport is rep- 
resentative. Our participation in the war has 
aggravated it, not changed it. The pre-war ma- 
chinery of adjustment and conciliation of the 
Department of Labor is too small and too weak 
to cope with it, and even if it were strong 
enough, it could affect only symptoms, not causes. 
The new machinery, consisting of the Commit-

THE DIAL 



[October 11 



tee on Labor of the Advisory Commission of the 
Council of National Defense, departmental ad- 
visors, and special committees like that headed 
by Mr. Louis Kerstein of Boston, is not co- 
ercive and therefore impotent. The readjust- 
ment which war conditions demand is a read- 
justment in principle, not in single cases. Merely 
to maintain the standards that existed before our 
entry into the war and this is the ruling pur- 
pose which the committee on labor has defined 
for itself requires a deference to a complex sit- 
uation of which all the factors are constantly 
changing. Changes in wages are accompanied 
by changes in all the conditions of existence. We 
face a situation in which rising wages go with 
falling standards of living. 

Now if the war worker is as significant as the 
soldier, he should receive the same care as the 
soldier. This care might be exercised at least 
through rigid government inspection of all plants 
where war work of any sort is done, and by a 
system of graded fines for failure to maintain 
definitely fixed minimum standards. Failure 
might be pilloried in the public press with "piti- 
less publicity." The report of Sir George New- 
man's committee failed in its effect, precisely for 
lack of such publicity. The administration of 
such a measure might well be entrusted to the 
committee on labor. 

But such inspection and publicity are only be- 
ginnings. Standards of working conditions and 
standards of living are very different things. A 
return to first principles must take into con- 
sideration standards of living. Men and women 
will work more efficiently and devotedly if they 
have the assurance that the future is guarded 
against the great fears that beset all proletarians 
the fear of unemployment, of accident, of ill- 
health, of penniless old age, and of death.* In- 
dustrial insurance in all war work is even more 
imperative than the proposed military insurance, 
and should follow the same lines. Only so can la- 
bor acquire anything but a hysterical interest in its 
share of the conduct of the war as a technique. 
But even this is a bare beginning. A real and 
enduring interest would require labor to become 
both responsive and responsible in the conduct 
of the war, and this implies on labor's part in- 
itiative far more than obedience. Consequently, 
a constitution, such as Mr. Webb recommends 
for British labor after the war, is a desirable 
instrument to enhance American labor's produc- 



tivity during the war. Mr. Justice Brandeis's 
famous protocol in the garment-industries contro- 
versy is the American instance of an industrial 
constitution. The traditionless character of 
American labor-organization gives it a leeway 
for action that the English organization does not 
possess. Labor itself should, wherever possible, 
be accountable for shop-conditions, for insurance, 
for maximum production. In those trades par- 
ticularly where the government supplies the raw 
materials, or the tools, or both, contracts might 
be made directly with the labor-unions, and they 
be left to themselves in carrying out the contracts. 
In the garment trades it is particularly easy to 
initiate such a movement. An advance among 
the war workers will force an advance in the 
whole industrial world. If, as is declared, 
strikes are fermented by agents of the enemy, it 
must also be remembered that both employers 
and the government give the enemy aid and 
comfort so long as they tolerate conditions that 
make strikes necessary. H M

Enrico Ferri 

CRIMINAL SOCIOLOGY. By Enrico Ferri. (Little, 
Brown & Co.; $5.) 

More than thirty years ago a young professor 
in the University of Sienna brought out a new 
work on the offender which he called "Criminal 
Sociology." This book still remains the most 
distinguished general contribution to the subject 
of criminology, though much of its data and 
some of its conclusions are now out of date. 
The remarkable fact about this work, which 
brought it such immediate as well as lasting 
fame, is that it broke largely with the older 
anthropological theories of crime and became the 
textbook of the newer sociological school of crim- 
inology. This older school was known as the 
positivist or Italian sometimes, from its greatest 
exponent, the Lombrosan school. The positiv- 
ist thinkers had in their day marked a distinct 
advance over the views of the classical or free- 
will theorists, which had persisted and dominated 
well into the nineteenth century. This older 
school had based its theory and treatment of the 
criminal upon a theory of the freedom of the 
will, holding that the offender is individually 
responsible for his acts and that the point of at- 
tack in repression or in reformation is upon the 
will itself rather than upon biological and en- 
vironmental factors. There is, of course, much 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



339 



truth in such a view, but when pushed to an 
extreme, it neglects just those factors, environ- 
mental and hereditary, which are now most em- 
phasized. Lombroso saw the weakness of the 
free-will or classical theory of criminal causation 
as a final explanation and sought to locate the 
causative factors in the physical and mental 
make-up of the criminal himself, assuming after 
the fashion of his time that such characteristics 
were inherited rather than acquired. This ex- 
plains Lombroso's dominant emphasis upon his 
several varieties of the "born criminal." 

Valuable as was this line of investigation, 
which sought to establish definite and measurable 
data of criminal causation, it finally became ri- 
diculous in the hands of its over-zealous sup- 
porters. Purely external characteristics, such as 
the shape of the head, the color of the skin, and 
the like, were urged as causes of criminality. 
This theory practically disregarded the factor of 
environmental causation, just as the older clas- 
sical school had failed to see both heredity and 
environment in accounting for crime. 

Ferri was only one of many scientific think- 
ers in the field of criminology and sociology who 
revolted against this one-sided emphasis, but he 
was one of the ablest of them all. After some 
years of study of both the environmental and 
hereditary factors, part of which time was spent 
as a pupil of Lombroso, he brought out his re- 
markable work in the first edition of 1882. By 
doing so he gave form to the synthetic or soci- 
ological theory of crime. He emphasized the 
neglected factor of environment more strongly 
even than he did the anthropological or heredi- 
tary ones. He continued to use much of the 
old terminology, including Lombroso's phrase the 
"born criminal" and the term "insane criminal," 
but he read a new content into these forms. To 
Ferri there is, strictly speaking, no such thing as 
a born criminal, though there are offenders who 
owe much of their criminal development to bad 
heredity as well as to defective environmental 
conditions. The influence of this new viewpoint 
in criminology, and especially of Ferri's effective 
presentation of it, cannot easily be overestimated. 
Just as the new outlook of the positivist school 
stimulated anthropological investigation, this so- 
ciological school did much to develop a science 
of environment, both as a starting-point for the 
study of criminal causation and as a basis for the 
formulation of a new penology and a revision of 
penal law. Ferri's sympathy with the socialist 
philosophy he was an active socialist and held 



political office did much to predispose him to 
a greater appreciation of environmental influ- 
ences. A scientific criminology, and therefore a 
scientific penology, was not possible until due 
weight could be given to such factors in crim- 
inal causation. 

Though the heart of Ferri's contribution is in 
his new and stimulating interpretation of the 
genesis of the criminal, many other contributions 
set forth in his book should not be neglected. 
For instance, his theory of penal substitutes, 
which is an early form of our modern emphasis 
upon prevention, has had a marked influence 
upon our constructive attitudes toward the of- 
fender. So simple were his proposals that we 
should reform our institutions, laws, govern- 
ments, and economic and social conditions as a 
substitute for our elaborate machinery of punish- 
ment, thus preventing the growth of most crim- 
inality, that it is surprising that such methods 
were not earlier appreciated and insisted upon. 
In the field of practical programmes he is mainly 
interested in the reform of criminal procedure, 
especially as it affects the conduct of the trial and 
the jury. He also devotes brief discussions to 
the problems of prison administration, penal 
colonies, deportation, prison architecture, and the 
like. His training was more on the legal and 
psychological than on the administrative side, a 
fact which accounts for his dominant interests. 

Ordinarily a mere translation of a book pre- 
sented to a foreign public some thirty years after 
its first publication would not call for extended 
comment, but too much cannot be said of Ferri's 
contribution even at this date. While most so- 
ciologists have accepted the new viewpoint and 
emphasis he has given us, popular thinking and 
the legal mind lag behind in the umbra of codes 
which are based upon the philosophy of the 
classical school of criminology.

Far apart as they are in other respects, these

different ways and degrees, disappoint that ex- 
pectation. In both, the psychology is brilliant 
and searching. Swift pencils of light are flashed

THE DIAL 



[October 11 



again and again upon strange creatures that we 
dimly knew inhabited somewhere in the human 
heart and brain but whose faces we have never 
seen before. In "Merlin," however, the story 
is blurred, impeded, and dull. In "An April 
Elegy" it is trivial and hackneyed. 

Potentially, of course, the Arthurian cycle re- 
mains for the poet of to-day what it has always 
been, perhaps the richest and most alluring body 
of legend in the world. But Mr. Robinson has 
not availed himself of this wealth. By the very 
nature of his endowment, perhaps, he could not. 

Highest and rarest of all is the dramatic genius 
which draws character out of events and deduces 
events from character, making us see the two as 
only the outer and inner aspects of one insepa- 
rable whole. But Mr. Robinson, though his 
dramatic powers are by no means negligible, pre- 
fers to choose one static situation and to revolve 
his persons about and about its central light, 
allowing them to catch from it here and there 
what glints they may of expression and signifi- 
cance. His strength lies in the close delineation 
of human types, studied usually in attitudes of 
imminent or actual failure. Though his deline- 
ation is close, he never attempts to make it com- 
plete. Where the shadows fall he lets them lie, 
and he studies his subject not directly but as one 
should look at a dim star, with the more sensi- 
tive outer fringes of the retina. So it was that 
he studied Captain Craig and Shakespeare and 
The Man Against the Sky, investing them first 
of all with mystery and shadow, out of which 
there gradually grew some scattered gleams of 
quintessential interpretation. 

For the rest, Mr. Robinson writes like a man 
who is moved to speech only slowly and with dif- 
ficulty, like one whose imagination constantly 
smoulders but seldom breaks into bright, clear 
flame. His best poetry is almost never caught 
out of the flying lyric moment, but is the slow 
accretion from intense, long brooding over past 
experience. The highly characteristic, highly 
successful "Flammonde" illustrates a method 
which has become almost a formula. Thus Mr. 
Robinson makes poetry, so to speak, out of his 
very reluctances and inhibitions. 

There can be no critical impertinence greater 
than that which tries to imprison a poet within 
the circle of his own past performance, and, de- 
spite our satisfaction in feeling that we have a 
writer adequately ticketed and shelved away, 
there are few of Mr. Robinson's readers who 
would not be glad to see him enter and possess 



some new field with the same mastery he has 
shown in the old. Nevertheless, one must feel 
it was a malicious elf that suggested Arthurian 
romance as a subject for his pen. The subject 
is new to him, but his method and manner are 
unchanged. Subject and method do not harmon- 
ize. Upon a style which has shaped itself in the 
delineation of modern types of mind complex, 
eccentric, intensely individualized is laid the 
task of depicting certain very unmodern charac- 
ters which throughout a long and august tradi- 
tion have been treated as simple, conventional, 
naive. The result, in less skilful hands, would 
have been burlesque. Only one character in the 
poem, Sir Lamorak, reminds us that the Arthur- 
ian hero was a man of deeds rather than of 
words, and he is so hemmed about with voluble 
carpet knights who hint, guess, infer, surmise, 
and query in the style of Henry James, that he 
himself can do little more than talk of action. 
And where are the jostle and press, the flashing 
color and sonorous din which five centuries of 
English poetry, going back to "Gawayne and 
the Green Knight," have made us feel we have 
a right to expect? They are sicklied o'er with 
the pale cast of thought. Where is that Merlin 
who loomed so hoary and hirsute upon one's 
childhood, the king-making, empire-building, 
cloud-compelling Merlin? "Gone, faded out of 
the story, the sea-faring friend I remember." 
We do not so much object that he should com- 
mit spiritual suicide, if only he had been allowed 
to "do it beautifully." But this perfumed, pur- 
ple-frocked, groomed, and barbered Merlin, with 
vine-leaves in his hair! One feels defrauded of 
a birthright. 

If, for a moment, we allow ourselves to be- 
lieve in Mr. Robinson's people, they suddenly 
appear amused and perplexed at themselves, as 
when Vivian complains of Merlin's beard: 

"O, that hair!" 

She moaned, as if in sorrow: "Must it be? 
Must every prophet and important wizard 
Be clouded so that nothing but his nose 
And eyes, and imitations of his ears 
Are there to make us know him when we see him ?" 

And again she says, scarcely in the tone of any 
traditional Vivian: 

Go on, and tell me all about the King; 
I'll bet the King had warts or carbuncles 
Or something wrong in his divine insides, 
To make him wish that Adam had died young. 

This is clearly the amused play of a modern 
mind upon the mediaeval characters, with the 
satire in the mouths of those characters them- 
selves, a recipe for excellent fooling, as Mark 



1917] 



THE DIAL

Twain's Connecticut Yankee showed, but in this 
instance the artist does not want his people to 
step from the canvas and criticize the picture. 
The fault is that of inadequate dramatic projec- 
tion. The poet is himself amused and perplexed. 
It is his unmistakably modern and all too idio- 
syncratic accent that we hear, the voice of the 
man who, in "Miniver Cheevey," has phrased 
to a nicety his estimate of sentimental mediae- 
valism. 

Mr. Robinson's habitual obscurity has never 
seemed less justified than it does in the present 
poem. There is no discoverable reason why 
Vivian should choose to ensnarl her meaning in 
the following tangle of words: 

You are the only one who sees enough 

To make me see how far away I am 

From all that I have seen and have not been. 

Here there is no great depth or intricacy of 
meaning, but merely a failure to make words do 
their work. Neither does this devious verbiage 
individualize the speaker, for it pervades the en- 
tire poem. In other places the reader is per- 
plexed by such things as the inordinate length of 
a sentence, ingeniously tortured sentence struc- 
ture, or the trick of the transferred epithet. 
When one sees that a poet is struggling with a 
meaning really beyond the reach of simple lan- 
guage, he is willing to do his part, especially in 
these days when clarity has come to connote the 
elementary, but it is hard to be patient with the 
mere mannerisms of profundity. Eventually we 
ask the man who assumes a mysterious and cryp- 
tic air for some commensurate enlightenment. 
In reading this poem, we do not get it. The 
arcana are dark to the end, and we are forced 
to think of other poems in which Mr. Robin- 
son's inveterate obscurity has had more excuse. 
He resembles his own Merlin, who has much 
to say about what he has seen and known with- 
out giving much notion of what it is, and who 
seems to rely upon our remembrance that he has 
been impressive in other scenes. 

Because it is all talk, leading no-whither, be- 
cause it is nearly void of external action, the 
poem seems inordinately long. It is, in fact, 
168 pages of supple, vigorous, often daring, blank 
verse. Here and there the clouds lift to give us 
brief glimpses of memorable beauty. There is 
one picture of summer woodland and another of 
Vivian's park the like of which Mr. Robinson 
never found in the pages of his master. And, 
finally, there is one simile almost beautiful enough 
to redeem every fault that has been mentioned. 



Merlin, foreseeing a dismal end of all for Arthur 
and himself, is bidding farewell to Vivian: 

"I was wrong that other day, 
For I have one more story. I am old." 
He waited like one hungry for the word 
Not said ; and she found in his eyes a light 
As patient as a candle in a window 
That looks upon the sea and is a mark 
For ships that have gone down. 

The plot of Mr. Ficke's poem reminds one 
as strongly of Elinor Glyn as the dialogue in 
"Merlin" does of Henry James. So far as plot 
is concerned and here it should be said that 
Mr. Ficke seems to hold the extreme romantic 
view that one's choice of subject is of no conse- 
quence the poem is as mawkish as the dream 
of a sentimental schoolgirl. A man and a woman, 
he a budding musician and she a young libertine 
of sensation somewhat world-weary after many 
conquests, encounter each other one morning by 
the sea. She invites him, an utter stranger, to 
enter her "little light-winged boat," and they 
sail out to sea for some four and twenty hours, 
with amorous results which are swift, perfervid, 
and catastrophic. Then she disappears in quest 
of further frivolities, leaving him to a long de- 
bauch of his habitual melancholy brooding, edged 
now with passionate recollections, and to his 
pipe-organ. After some months during which 
he tortures himself with alternate longing and 
well-founded doubts of the girl's honesty, he sees 
her again for the second and last time. But the 
girl, an arrant and unabashed sensationalist, 
thinking it impossible ever to "recapture the first 
fine careless rapture," bids him a long and last 
farewell. 

The whole-hearted sentimentalism of this tale, 
for which one is tempted to suggest the title 
"Two Nights," will certainly recommend it to 
many, though scarcely to those readers whom 
Mr. Ficke's real powers and previous perform- 
ance fit him to address. Considered as a story, 
it is "fine lady" literature, with just the proper 
tincture of the pornographic. There are other 
readers who will find in its fever and ague of 
passion and in its treatment of situations which 
Puritans, and some others, tend to ignore, in- 
dubitable signs of what they understand as 
"realism." In fact, the story is wildly unreal. 
But those capable of appreciating the many pas- 
sages of rare beauty and insight which the poem 
contains will understand that the story, taken 
by itself, is simply the old familiar "fiddling of 
harmonics upon the strings of sensualism."

PRESIDENT WILSON FROM AN ENGLISH POINT OF 
VIEW. By H. Wilson Harris. (Frederick A.

In presenting an English view of President 
Wilson, Mr. Harris has performed a service as 
valuable for American as for English readers. 
We of the United States, observing the inevi- 
table inaccuracies and deficiencies in the con- 
sideration of our politics by a careful British 
student, may have a renewed comprehension of 
the greater depths of our ignorance of English 
politics. 

Mr. Harris attempts an unadorned biography 
of Woodrow Wilson and a simple exposition of 
his presidential policies. What may appeal to 
most Americans as a fundamental error is his 
assumption that Mr. Wilson is primarily an in- 
itiating leader. A leader of exceptional power he 
undoubtedly is, but one who customarily takes the 
lead after a project has been formulated and 
organized and advanced to the dignity of either 
majority or strong minority support. This ap- 
pears to be his self-chosen role. He does not 
waste his energy or influence in seeking out new 
roads and persuading the doubting hosts to 
follow. He watches mass opinion closely, and 
with the certainty of genius waits for and recog- 
nizes the gradual emergence of mature convic- 
tions and issues from the confused discussion of 
unhealthy or undeveloped policies wherein demo- 
cracy thinks out loud. 

Mr. Harris observes, for example, that the 
President changed his deprecation of prepared- 
ness in 1914 to a fervent advocacy before 1916, 
but lays the change largely to the education of 
Mr. Wilson by the events of 1915, giving the im- 
pression that the President then transmitted his 
enlightenment to the people. More accurately 
he might have written that the events of 1915, 
interpreted by the propagandists of preparedness, 
had enlightened the American people. A mass 
opinion demanding increased armament was 
formed, not with Mr. Wilson's aid, but consid- 
erably despite his very powerful resistance. The 
President, a high type of pacifist, reluctantly ac- 
cepted the changed public opinion as his mentor. 
He took the lead with obvious hesitation, ex- 
hibited notably in his controversy with Secretary 
of War Garrison, but public opinion massed it- 
self in increasing strength behind even this doubt- 
ing leadership and when the break with Germany 
came the President was able to swing it against 



a stumbling, irresolute Congress, driving through 
his vast programme with enheartening ease. 

Mexico furnishes perhaps a more vivid ex- 
ample of Mr. Wilson's quality on the negative 
side. The American people formulated no policy 
with regard to Mexico and the President in con- 
sequence, like the people, adopted "watchful 
waiting." The President had splendid ideals of 
Pan-Americanism, but ideals are not policies and 
it is a certain touchstone for Mr. Wilson's ad- 
ministration to note that his ideals are translated 
into policies only after the democracy, whose 
great servant he aspires to be and is, has formu- 
lated an opinion which can be relied upon to 
support an executive programme. 

Woodrow Wilson the statesman combines a 
patient firmness in action, and an intellectual 
self-sufficiency in counsel, with an amazing and 
seemingly inconsistent responsiveness to public 
opinion. To interpret the public will seems to 
be his chosen ideal for a leader of democracy. 
To write successfully the life of such a man re- 
quires an intimate knowledge of the politics and 
politicians of his time. This knowledge Mr. 
Harris admittedly lacks. His minimizing of the 
profound influence of Progressivism, and the 
Progressive Party upon the President is peculiarly 
irritating to anyone well acquainted with the 
last decade of American politics. Mr. Harris 
refers to Senator La Follette, who bitterly op- 
posed the Progressive Party and supported Wil- 
son, as "one of the founders of the Progressive 
Party." He describes the Progressive plat- 
form, which sounded an absolutely new note in 
American politics and attacked vigorously both 
the old parties, as "a curious amalgam of the 
Republican and Democratic." 

An inclination to be harsh with Mr. Harris 
should be restrained because of the clear sin- 
cerity and good intention of his work. He 
writes of recent American politics without a 
comprehension of the powerful influence of Col- 
onel Roosevelt, and of the magnitude and depth 
of the struggle between him and Mr. Wilson. 
The two men are utterly different in character 
and method, and the conflict between them is 
inevitable and elemental. The life of neither 
can be written without a fair knowledge of the 
other. Mr. Harris labors under the handicap 
of having only superficial information concern 
ing both. 

His book will have the largest value for 
Americans in his interpretation of Mr. Wilson's 
international polity. Here, with a better com- 



1917]

prehension of the issues and factors involved, he 
interprets more skilfully. Here, also, he is de- 
lineating a Wilson who is less the speaker of, 
and more the speaker for, democracy. The 
American people comprehend so little of inter- 
national relations that they are accustomed to 
accept without controversy the presidential de- 
terminations of their will toward other peoples, 
The abrupt reversal of a policy of national isola- 
tion aroused little opposition, because to the 
masses "isolation," "Monroe Doctrine," "im- 
perialism," and such terms had no poignant sig- 
nificance. The Balkan question will mean 
nothing to us as a people until it begins to cost us 
blood and money. Upon international questions 
Mr. Wilson spoke for the people, and his pur- 
poses rather than those of our people may be 
read in those utterances. Mr. Harris's exposi- 
tion of Wilson as President of Humanity to use 
the phrase of a hostile critic is therefore more 
accurate and illuminating than his well-inten- 
tioned but inadequate presentation of Wilson as 
President of the United States.

The Belgian Carthage 

THE NEW CARTHAGE. By Georges Eekhoud. 
(Duffield & Co. $1.50.) 

After reading this work by the Belgian nov- 
elist, Eekhoud, one wonders whether it would 
have been translated if it had been written by 
anyone but a Belgian. One wonders further why 
this should have been the specimen of Eekhoud's 
work chosen for translation. There is a certain 
irony in the contrast between the "profound 
homage" with which the translator dedicates his 
work to the Belgian King, and this very unsavory 
picture of modern Antwerp, told by a passionate 
radical. If only good should be spoken of the 
martyred, some readers will not care to learn 
of the hatred of the people for the conscript 
army, of the miserable, exploited industrial serfs 
of Belgium, of the greedy and soulless upper- 
class society of Antwerp. But to the translator, 
Mr. Lloyd R. Morris, any Belgian book is evi- 
dently a good book, and he sends this one forth 
duly expurgated of those franknesses in which 
"Anglo-Saxon and Gallic taste are at variance." 
Even this neatest excuse for prudery, however, 
leaves in the book many of those "sensual aspects 
of life" which Mr. Morris in his preface tells us 
are of the Fleming's genius. 



One could wish that a novel written about the 
great port on the Scheldt, so cruel, opulent, de- 
generate, with its grasping bourgeoisie and its 
swarming youthful workers, had made that life 
more vivid before our eyes. Eekhoud writes un- 
doubtedly with strong anti-capitalist feeling, with 
hope for the day when Antwerp will "be restored 
again to her true children." He has a great 
theme, and he knows his city through all its 
turbulent layers. But he does not fuse the life 
really into artistic form. One thinks of "Ger- 
minal," and one misses the power and deep ref- 
erence and social orientation of Zola. One 
thinks of "Pillars of Society" and one misses the 
cold, cutting subtlety of Ibsen in his exposure 
of that greed of the capitalist which sweeps 
away all human consideration. And one thinks 
of "Pelle" and misses the palpitating mass-life 
with its hunger, and its pathetic struggle against 
its masters and the elements. Eekhoud, in using 
these themes, suffers immeasurably by contrast 
with these greater books. His individuals are 
too unrelieved in their villainous materialism. 
They become stagy and thin. The city is uncon- 
vincingly fantastic in the Carthaginian flavor at- 
tributed to it. The separate scenes are not 
worked out, and the plot has little firmness of 
fibre. The city is seen through the eyes of the 
sensitive young Laurent, who leaves the unsym- 
pathetic relatives with whom he is brought up 
and follows a roving life, first with a group of 
radical artists and writers and then with poor 
workmen and the "runners" of the wharves. 
The thread of story is carried along through his 
love for the beautiful and wealthy Gina, his 
cousin, who marries a vile speculator, Bejard, 
trafficker in emigrants and war supplies, and 
grinder of child workers. The story passes to 
a melodramatic end in the sinking of the rotten 
ship which Bejard has loaded with deluded emi- 
grants among whom were Laurent's friends 
for Brazil, and the destruction of Laurent and 
his enemy in the explosion of the latter's cart- 
ridge plant. 

Yet this ending has not half the tragic power 
of that even more melodramatic denouement of 
"Germinal," after we have followed for so long 
the pathos of individual lives set in the inexorable 
horror of modern industry. Eekhoud's novel is 
more the brave attempt of a writer who is a soci- 
ological prophet rather than an artist. Like a 
true socialist, he feels classes rather than indi- 
vidual lives. The best things are always the 
racy pictures of peasants, conscripts, dockers,

young criminals, and prostitutes. Here is the col- 
orful type that he feels, the pulsing movement 
of the crowd. Read as a series of picturesque 
sketches of the life of the old port, the book is 
keenly interesting. Yet somehow in these groups, 
vividly and distinctly as they are felt, the sense 
of both the city as a whole and of the breathing 
significance of individual lives caught in the clash 
of groups, is strangely missing. The groups 
somehow delightfully live, but not the city which 
they compose nor the people who compose them.

Whims 

UNICORNS. By James Huneker. (Charles Scrib- 
ner't Sons; $1.75.) 

Mr. Huneker has developed of late an un- 
restrained fondness for apocalyptic beasts. His 
totem in the present volume is the Unicorn, but 
he has not wholly abandoned his Ivory Apes and 
Peacocks, and when he essays to volplane peril- 
ously through the Fourth Dimension of Space, 
it is on the back of the Hippogriff, "with its 
liberating wings." The Unicorn, says Mr. 
Huneker, enables us to feel "the nostalgia of the 
infinite, the sorcery of dolls, the salt of sex, the 
vertigo of them that skirt the edge of perilous 
ravines . . ." He is cosmopolite and ideal- 
ist and easily filled with ecstasy in the presence 
of the Seven Arts. He is, you may infer, a 
humorous projection of Mr. Huneker's own ego 
the symbol of his life-long search for the 
beautiful. 

To anyone curious about the growth of our 
culture Mr. Huneker's case is worth attention. 
He went abroad to saturate himself in the atmos- 
phere of art somewhere near the beginning of 
the eighties. It was a great period for the 
devotee and he was a born devotee. The cult of 
art was never more resplendent or developed on 
a scale more grandiose and imposing. There was 
a touch of the mysticism of religiosity, a sacred 
ritual, and the austerity of personal sacrifice. 
Art then had its popes and its celibates. The 
incomparable Flaubert died in that period and 
was straightway canonized. "Madame Bovary" 
was the breviary of the novice. Huysmans was 
on the point of exhibiting the true source of 
much of this exaltation by writing "A Rebours" 
and preparing to merge the asceticism of the artist 
in that of the churchman. Whether the writer 
dealt with life directly or only dreamed about it 



in the studio, his vocation expressed a passion to 
separate himself from his fellows, from the vulgar 
mediocrity of the herd. To epater le bourgeois 
was not simply a pleasure; it was a duty and 
a badge of caste. The pontiffs of that shining 
period were as remorseless as the most violent 
of the Bolsheviki. Not being able to annihilate 
the bourgeoisie, they found it convenient to pil- 
lory them and to amaze them by the extrava- 
gances of art. A little later on, with Mallarme, 
the crown was to be bestowed for unintclligibility. 
It was a world soaked in the delusion of 
grandeur. 

The phenomenon of Mr. Huneker's style can- 
not be explained without reference to those years 
in Paris. He has lived through a transitional 
period, and he has come a little way along the 
new road. With what reluctance the reader 
is left to guess. He has, for example, a con- 
siderable indulgence for the bourgeois. He no 
longer sees him as the black beast with hoofs and 
long furry ears. But he can't avoid trying to 
shock him now and then by the extravagance of 
his language, any more than he can avoid 
instructing him in the course of the arts. Daisy 
Miller was abroad in the period of Mr. Hune- 
ker's novitiate and there is plenty of evidence on 
which to base the suspicion that he met her and 
took the measure of her limitations. She still 
represents his compatriots for him an eager but 
innocent crew, who need a Baedeker in the 
realm of the arts. This sense of our limitations 
has been a handicap to Mr. Huneker. It has 
betrayed him into making of his work a curious 
pastiche a mosaic of facts, dates, gossip, and 
criticism, with quotation predominating. The 
resulting pattern is bizarre, and it must give 
foreigners an exaggerated notion of the gaps in 
our national culture. Open his latest book at 
random and you come upon such passages as 
this: 

At old Flaubert used to say: such books are false, 
nature is not like that. How keenly he saw through 
the humbug of "free love" a romantic tradition of 
George Sand's epoch may be noted in his comment 
that Emma Bovary found in adultery all the plati- 
tudes of marriage. Ah! that much despised, stupid, 
venerable institution, marriage! How it has been 
flouted since the days of Rousseau the father of false 
romanticism and that stupefying legend, the "equal- 
ity" of mankind. (O! the beautiful word, "equality," 
invented for the delectation of rudimentary minds.) 

Or this bit on George Sand : 

She had charm. She had style, serene, flowing, 
also tepid and fatuous, the style detested by Charles 
Baudelaire, and admired by Turgenev and Kenan and 
Lamennais. Baudelaire remarked of this "best sel- 
ler" that she wrote her chefs d'oeuvres as if they were 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



345 



letters, and posted them. The "style coulant," praised 
by bourgeois critics, he abhorred, as it lacked accent, 
relief, individuality. "She is the Prudhomme of im- 
mortality," he said not a bad definition and "she 
is stupid, heavy, and a chatterer." She loves the 
proletarian, and her sentiment is adapted to the intel- 
ligent wife of the concierge and the sentimental har- 
lot. Which shows that even such a versatile critic 
as Baudelaire had his prejudices. 

It is all in the same manner, obligingly in- 
formative and genially casual. It has the com- 
pactness of pemmican. It is guaranteed by the 
authority of great names, and shows an agile 
intellect dovetailing epigrams. Mr. Huneker has 
never escaped from the blight of cleverness that 
characterized the nineties. He has the air of a 
bon-vivant who dines nightly with the Muses 
and has to store up dinner-table witticisms to 
keep them from yawning like the weary business 
man. To be sure, he borrows more than he 
invents, but even that is a strain on the memory 
unless he keeps a card catalogue or a secretary. 
One trembles to think of what would happen if 
the memory were to go blank or the card cata- 
logue to go up in smoke. Mr. Huneker's pages 
would look like dispatches that had gone through 
the hands of the censor. 

If we turn from the manner to the under- 
lying philosophy, we see that Mr. Huneker 
sweeps here, too, with a wide net that takes in 
metaphysics, science, sociology, and political 
philosophy. "Science only attains the knowledge 
of the correspondence and relativity of things 
no mean intellectual feat, by the way but not 
of the things themselves . . ." "Man must 
no longer be egocentric. The collective soul is 
born. The psychology of the mob, according to 
Professor Le Bon, is different from the psychol- 
ogy of the individual . . . Mob psychology 
is always false psychology. The crowd obliter- 
ates the ego." "His birth, breeding, and tem- 
perament made Mallock a foe to socialism, to the 
promiscuous in politics, religion, society, there- 
fore an apostle of culture, not missing its precious 
side; witness Mr. Rose in The New Republic, 
and one who abhorred the crass and the irre- 
verent in the New Learning." "Withal, the 
didactic side of our fiction is overdone. I set 
it down to the humbug about the 'masses' being 
opposed to the 'classes.' Truly a false antithesis 
. . . As if a poor man suddenly enriched 
didn't prove, as a rule, the hardest taskmaster 
to his own class. Consider the new-rich. What 
a study they afford to the students of manners 
." and so on, and so on. 

To compensate for a suspicion of staleness in 
these high realms, Mr. Huneker shows his hospi- 



tality by embracing "Creative Involution" and 
turning joyous somersaults in the Fourth Dimen- 
sion of Space. But that, I am sure, is only his 
way of escaping from the tyranny of the actual, 
and we may fairly lay the blame on the Unicorn 
and the Hippogriff and suspect that he has his 
tongue in his cheek. Even a ghostly and dimin- 
ished passion to epater le bourgeois is likely to 
tempt a man to keep a strange menagerie about 
the premises, especially a man who loves a joke 
as well as Mr. Huneker. His great merit is that 
he has banished solemnity and cant; he talks 
about books because he loves them, and there isn't 
an ounce of pedantry in his whole nature. 

GEORGE BERNARD DONLIN. 



A Tar able of Toleration 

THE COMING. By J. C. Snaith. (D. Appleton 

& Co.; $1.50.) 

Fiction can express almost any idea of which 
the human mind is capable, certainly all ideas 
relating to human character, intercourse, social 
relations, and government. A novel cannot in- 
clude a treatise on vector analysis, but if a novel- 
ist wishes to do such a strange thing and knows 
how to manage narrative, he can make one of 
his characters a professor of mathematics and 
through the professor's talk indicate that vector 
analysis is, or is not, of value to humanity. We 
do not expect to find in a love story a discourse 
on free trade or any other formal division of 
economics; yet a novelist can make his young 
man and the girl's father political opponents and 
so bring out any idea about free trade that he 
wishes to impress on the reader. It all depends 
on how skilfully the novelist manages the talk 
of his characters, how deeply he interests us in 
the persons who hold this opinion or that. 

English and American novelists have dealt 
with all manner of political, social, and religious 
ideas. Dickens, George Eliot, Charles Reade, 
Trollope, Meredith, Mrs. Stowe, Howells, not 
to mention Wells, Galsworthy, and the many 
other young, alert students of life, have found 
the novel a palatable vehicle for ideas that in 
straight doses are hard to digest. In Russia, 
where ideas if put in the expository form most 
suitable to them used to be suppressed, the novel- 
ists wrapped a pill that would have been bitter 
to the government, in the sugar of romance. 
Aylmer Maude quotes in his "Life of Tolstoy" a 
letter from Drouzhinin, a Russian critic: 

An Englishman or an American may laugh at the 



346 



THE DIAL 



[October 11 



fact that in Russia not merely men of thirty, but gray- 
haired owners of two thousand serfs sweat over 
stories of a hundred pages, which appear in the 
magazines, are devoured by everybody, and arouse 
discussion in society for a whole day. However much 
artistic quality may have to do with this result, you 
cannot explain it merely by art. What in other lands 
is a matter of idle talk and careless dilettantism, 
with us is quite another affair. Among us things 
have taken such shape that a story the most frivo- 
lous and insignificant form of literature becomes one 
of two things: either it is rubbish, or else it is the 
voice of a leader sounding through the empire. 

In England and America official restriction of 
thought has not yet become so strangling as it 
was in Russia before the revolution. But in both 
the so-called Anglo-Saxon democracies there are 
disheartening signs of a disposition on the part 
of officialdom and of "public opinion" to throttle 
the ideas of the liberal minority; such signs are 
the treatment accorded by the British govern- 
ment to the temperate and high-minded pro- 
tests of Bertrand Russell and others, and, in this 
country, the utter disregard, by Congress and 
others in authority, of the constitutional guaran- 
tee of freedom of speech and press and of the 
right of peaceful assemblage. If Mr. Snaith had 
set forth in direct exposition or argument the 
essential ideas of "The Coming," he might even 
now be confined, like his mystical hero, in a 
state institution for lunatics, or more likely in 
a penal institution, along with Morel and the 
rest. Probably it was not so much a considera- 
tion of this danger as the artist's knowledge that 
the parable, a form at least as old as the Bible, 
can be artistically as well as ethically effective, 
which led him to cast his ideas in the mould of 
fiction. 

The least favorable thing that can be said 
about "The Coming" is that the personages in 
whom the ideas are embodied are not sufficiently 
specific and individual. The clergyman is a con- 
ventional clergyman, he is generalized, provin- 
cial "vicarism," as compared with Trollope's 
clergymen who, as Trollope himself said, with 
his sure instinct for character, are men first, who 
happen, as a secondary matter, to be priests. Dr. 
Jollife is a conventional Irishman. Murdwell, 
the American inventor, is not only the American 
as the Englishman conceives the type, clothes, 
manner, breeziness, and all, but also the literary 
man's conventionalized idea of the inventive, 
scientific genius. The mystical, Messianic hero 
does not quite emerge visibly and audibly a 
creature of flesh and blood; but vagueness and 
unreality are, to be sure, in character with this 
strange superhuman being. And the parabolic 
nature of the story perhaps justifies the general- 



ization of all the characters, who are meant to 
stand for types of ideas. 

The miraculous cure and the mysterious Well- 
sian discovery of the inventor are unnecessary- 
burdens on probability; they threaten to drive 
it outside the frame of reality. In this respect 
the story is inferior to Artzibashef's "Death of 
Ivan Lande." In that story the forces which 
the idealist encounters and before which he 
finally succumbs are the plain everyday facts of 
life. This is what would happen to the saint, 
and what, in the greatest case in history, did 
happen. Yet though the individual perishes, the 
ideas survive, for there is the Bible, and there is 
your novelist, the modern parabolist, who in the 
very act of recording the death or defeat of a 
character preserves the ideas for which he died; 
they "arouse discussion in society for a whole 
day," perhaps for many a day. Mr. Snaith 
makes his idealist triumphant by the too easy 
device of endowing him with dramatic genius 
which takes the world by storm and revolution- 
izes the theatre. I will believe that when Mr. 
Snaith writes the wonderful play that wins the 
Nobel peace prize and finds an idealist under the 
waistcoat of an American theatrical manager. 
Mr. Snaith's saint converts his enemy and makes 
a real Christian of him. That is barely possible, 
but it is asking a good deal of human nature, 
of that kind of human nature which he ascribes 
to the vicar. He would have served ideas as 
well if he had worked them out as the Russian 
did in "Ivan Lande," and not made them so 
immediately and practically victorious. 

For the essential ideas are good, and at pres- 
ent it is real service to have presented them in 
an attractive way. Those ideas are so simple, 
so humane, the commonplaces of two thousand 
years, that it is bewildering to think that they 
seem insane to an insane world and wicked to a 
wicked world. John Smith has the audacity 
to quote some of the charitable and pacific sen- 
timents of the Bible. Therefore he is blasphe- 
mous. He is a poet, and speaks in parables, 
riddles, mystic metaphors. Therefore he is in- 
sane. He has a vision, which he regards as a 
reality; Goethe appears to him and says, "I have 
come to pray for Germany." "Certainly," 
John Smith, "I am very glad to pray for Ger- 
many." Therefore he is a traitor, to be prose- 
cuted, if he be intellectually responsible, under 
the Defense of the Realm regulations. The offi- 
cial attitude toward German literature (Mr. 
Snaith reserves this ironic thrust for the end of 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



347 



the book) is that of the representative of the 
Royal Academy of Literature who said at a pub- 
lic meeting that "he had done with Goethe for- 
ever." 

The vicar stands for ecclesiastic and civil 
authority. He is all for duty, justice, and kind- 
ness. He and the English have Christ and the 
right on their side ; the Germans are the incarna- 
tion of wrong, Antichrist. Minister of a religion 
which deals in parables, visions, poetic indirec- 
tions, sublime impracticalities, he has not imagina- 
tion enough to have caught the spirit of the idiom 
which he employs every Sunday. All that sort 
of thing happened in the world long ago, once 
for all; that anything like it should be embodied 
in a modern man is inconceivable, worse than 
that, sacrilegious. There seem to be many 
Christians like the vicar on both sides of the con- 
flict; you are at liberty to share Mr. Snaith's 
optimistic confidence that they can be brought 
to see the light. 

The inventor, Murdwell, represents the sui- 
cide of science by its own prowess. The devil- 
ish ingenuity of invention has been turned to the 
destruction of the world. A horrible agent of 
death which Murdwell has discovered fortunately 
dies with him. This expresses the literary ideal- 
ist's despair of scientific achievement, the old 
contest between knowledge and spirit. The 
character is not convincing, but the problem it 
suggests is interesting, whether the conquest of 
natural forces by human intelligence will result 
in the annihilation of the race or will be directed 
to constructive ends. 

The best character is the squire who has come 
home from the war paralyzed. He hates war, 
hated it before he went into it, but did his part 
faithfully and accepts his invalidity without com- 
plaint. He does not hate people, even Germans, 
and he is baffled and distressed by the animosi- 
ties of civilians who are more bitter than the 
men in the trenches. Though it is unlikely 
that soldiers on either side are wasting much 
affection on their enemies, yet there is evidence 
that the actual business of fighting does not 
engender a permanent spirit of revenge; that 
American officer who counselled his men that 
they must learn to be "dirty fighters" has not yet 
been in the trenches. There are abundant 
records of fraternization between Union and 
Confederate soldiers during the Civil War, cer- 
tainly soon after the war. It may be that we 
shall have to wait for the soldiers to come home 
to chasten the odiums of militant civilians. 

JOHN MACY. 



BRIEFS 

IN GOOD COMPANY. By Coulson Kerna- 
han. Lane; $1.50. 

A poet who had just published a volume of 
verses was asked whether Theodore Watts-Dun- 
ton was likely to review the book in the "Athen- 
aeum." "God forbid!" was the poet's reply, as 
recorded by Mr. Kernahan. "He would simply 
make my unfortunate book the peg upon which 
to hang a wonderful literary robe of spun silk 
and fine gold. He would begin omitting all 
mention of me or my book with some general- 
isation, some great first principle, whether of 
life, literature, science or art, no one, other than 
himself or the God who made him, could ever be 
sure beforehand. . . Then he would launch 
out into an essay, incomparable in knowledge and 
in scholarship, that would deal with everything 
in heaven or earth other than my unhappy little 
book. . . I should deem myself fortunate if, 
at the end of the review, I found my name as 
much as mentioned. . . if there were as much 
as one line in the whole four-page essay about 
my book." 

Mr. Kernahan's recollections offer many a 
tempting "peg." The paragraph just quoted, 
supplemented by Watts-Dunton's own similar, 
though soberer, version of his method of review- 
ing, is a challenge to a discussion of the func- 
tion of the critic. The statement, made rather 
mournfully, that Watts-Dunton's "magnum opus 
must be looked for, not in literature but in friend- 
ship," and that his best books stand upon our 
shelves with the names of Dante Gabriel Rossetti 
and Algernon Charles Swinburne on their covers, 
invites a tribute to those uncelebrated artists whose 
genius -finds expression in the ephemeral art of 
being. The somewhat naive speculation as to 
whether Oscar Wilde's sins may not be traced, 
literally, to demoniacal possession demands a 
jeremiad on the unconquerable propensity of hu- 
man beings to overestimate the importance of the 
irrelevant. Most of all, the epigram of some 
famous unknown, with which the foreword be- 
gins " 'Recollections' are generally written by 
people who have either entirely lost their mem- 
ories or who have never, themselves, done any- 
thing worth remembering" is an opening for a 
discussion of the place of the literary gossip in 
literature. 

All of which is by way of saying that Mr. 
Kernahan's book, like all good company, is stim- 
ulating and provocative. It is too often dull; it 
is marred by mysterious hints at things the author 
might tell an he would, and by a very wearisome 
and embarrassing an almost servile self-depre- 
ciation. And yet the glimpses that it affords of 
such ever-interesting figures as Swinburne, 
Watts-Dunton, Oscar Wilde, and the mountain-

THE LATIN AT WAR. By Will Irwin. 

Appleton; $1.75. 

The habit of rilling up column space will 
always be a menace to newspaper writers. The 
present book should be cut down to half its size. 
The author is a good observer, he has had excel- 
lent opportunities to see the French and Italian 
armies, and he paints some graphic scenes; but 
his pages are cluttered up with long descriptions 
of things that do not count. If the reader will 
skip everything up to the author's arrival at 
the Italian front, he will be saved much weari- 
ness and will be inclined to read on. This is 
the best part of the book. The author describes 
in a stirring manner his visit to the Alpine 
heights, through trenches in the snow and dug- 
outs in the solid rock, among batteries on moun- 
tain peaks where one would hardly believe guns 
could go. The Italian officer as we find him 
here is a most attractive figure, courteous, digni- 
fied, cheerful, and ever solicitous for the safety 
of his guest. These scenes will be new to most 
readers of war books. The later chapters are 
given up to the French again, largely around 
Verdun and in Lorraine. 

THE HEART OF THE BALKANS. By De- 
metra Vaka. Houghton Mifflin; $1.50. 
There are two kinds of travel books. In one 
the author devotes himself to matter-of-fact in- 
formation regarding routes, hotels, what to see, 
and so on. In the other kind, the writer treats 
all that he sees subjectively and, consciously or 
unconsciously, creates literature. "The Heart 
of the Balkans" is in the latter class. It would 
make a poor guidebook indeed, but it is some- 
thing better. Demetra Vaka and her brother 
travel through Albania, Montenegro, Servia, and 
Bulgaria, which means a trip on mules or ponies 
over roads that are hardly more than paths, and 
among a people barely civilized, where the best 
and cleanest hospitality is offered by the village 
priests. The men consider fighting the chief 
business of man. Demetra Vaka's concern, 
however, is primarily with the women: what 
they are like mentally and physically, and what 
their economic status is. She puts the various 
nationalities before us with great insight and lit- 
erary power. She herself is a Greek, born in 
Constantinople, so she is well fitted to speak of 
these peoples. Her word pictures of the physical 
appearance of each land are suggestive and 
touched with beauty. 



A CHARACTER SKETCH OF GENERAL THE 
HON. J. C. SMUTS. By N. Levi. Long- 
mans, Green ; $2.50. 

General Smuts is only forty-seven years old, 
despite the long record of varied achievement to 
his credit, and so the time has not yet come to 
write his biography, in the full sense of the word. 
But a very good beginning to such a work is 
furnished in this "character sketch" written by 
a South African journalist friend of Jan Smuts, 
whose admiration for his hero sums itself up 
in the closing assertion that "we are too close 
to our mountain to appreciate its altitude." The 
versatility of the man is attested in the brief 
aummary: "In law he shone most brilliantly 
during the years that came after the Boer War, 
when he had still a private practice. As a poli- 
tician he may be said to have done his best work 
hitherto as a Minister of the Transvaal, but we 
do not know what lies ahead. Few will doubt 
that he would have been an eminent divine, a 
great chemist, a famous surgeon, a Gargantuan 
tiller of the soil, had he not entered public life. 
His adaptability as a warrior is exemplified by 
what is happening at this very moment." Never- 
theless one may safely doubt whether he would 
have been preacher, chemist, surgeon, and far- 
mer, all in one, had not public life claimed him. 
The author speaks of some who "delight in paint- 
ing him as an overintelligent Frankenstein, stalk- 
ing through the human throng with scarcely a 
human feeling in him." But it was not Frank- 
enstein that did the stalking, as has been pointed 
out often enough. In its contrasting portraits 
of the Cambridge-student Smuts and the mature 
statesman and general, the lank and lean and 
pasty-complexioned bookworm and the stalwart 
commander of imposing presence, this "character 
sketch" presents two strikingly dissimilar person- 
alities to the casual observer, at least. 

THE PSYCHOLOGY OF CITIZENSHIP. By 
Arland D. Weeks. McClurg; 50 cts. 
Words of special emphasis should be reserved 
to commend this small but unusually able and 
attractive book. Professor Weeks has succeeded 
in carrying a message of vital significance, in 
phrasing it in an effective style, and above all in 
selecting for emphasis the focal points of interest 
to the understanding of the mind of the citizen. 
This is popular psychology directed with skill to 
problems of daily concern. The emphasis upon 
the mind of the citizen means that social purpose 
can be accomplished only in so far as the task is 
accepted and understood by the intelligence of 
the average citizen. The limitation of reasoning 
must thus be admitted in addition to the need- 
less limitations that affect social progress. Social 
inertia makes the most difficult and expensive 
variety of modern education, that of educating

aldermen and legislators and others concerned 
with communal interests. The psychology of 
citizenship is profoundly affected by the use of 
machinery, for this acts directly upon the human 
mind. The enormous significance of the mode 
of labor and its conflicts, the effects of modern 
publicity in shaping opinion, the peculiar char- 
acter and disabilities of the legal mind, the domi- 
nations of the sense of propriety, the difficulties 
of establishing other varieties of human value, 
all these form a part of the psychology of citi- 
zenship, and are set forth with extraordinary 
skill in this manual. 

A CONCORDANCE TO THE POEMS OF ED- 
MUND SPENSER. By Charles Grosvenor 
Osgood. The Carnegie Institution of Wash- 
ington; $20. 

The publication of a concordance to a great 
poet is an important event in literary criticism. 
Such a work provides an extended and instruc- 
tive commentary on the diction and subject-mat- 
ter of the poet; facilitates research and a better 
understanding of all poets and poetry ; tests criti- 
cal judgments and opinions; enhances the value 
of other concordances in the search for literary 
relationships both agreements and differences; 
and by thorough analysis prepares the way for 
original creation. The number of concordances 
has in recent years rapidly increased as their 
value has become apparent; yet Spenser has been 
missing from the list, a fact the more noticeable 
because of his rank in an age preeminent in Eng- 
lish literature, and because of the vast influence 
which he has exerted on later poets. As a cor- 
rective of much shallow, general, and misleading 
Spenserian criticism ; as an aid in discovering the 
full significance of the poet's intricate allegory; 
and finally, as a means of arriving at his real 
values "that his cultural and spiritual power may 
be enlarged among readers," a concordance to 
Spenser easily justifies its existence. 

Professor Osgood 's task involved a vast 
amount of mechanical labor and many perplex- 
ing problems. The absence of an authentic basic 
text necessitated much textual criticism in adapt- 
ing and collating three others. Spenser's incon- 
sistent use of hyphened compounds, his lawless 
orthography, and his use of archaic forms and 
dialect suggest some of the difficulties faced by 
the editor in his efforts to make a most service- 
able work, and overcome by him with rare pa- 
tience and scholarship. With their accustomed 
efficiency and thoroughness the Carnegie Institu- 
tion of Washington have, as publishers, left 
nothing undone that would add to the attractive- 
ness and dignity of the volume. To both editor 
and publishers all students and lovers of poetry 
owe a lasting debt of gratitude. 



OUR PART IN THE GREAT WAR. By 

Arthur Gleason. Stokes; $1.35. 

The outstanding feature of this book is its col- 
lection of extracts from the war diaries of cap- 
tured German soldiers. Mr. Gleason is said 
to be the only person not a government official 
of France or England who has been allowed free 
access to this unique library of unprinted war 
literature; and the fact of his having had this 
free access is proved by facsimile pages presented 
with translations in sufficient number to carry 
conviction. Significant indeed are these attes- 
tations of deliberate atrocity from the perpetra- 
tors themselves. Reluctance, abhorrence even, 
are often evident; but disobedience to the high 
command is apparently unthinkable. "That is 
what we were ordered to do," writes one sol- 
dier at the end of his shameful record, and other 
similar entries are not wanted in other diaries. 
"The people of Germany have bowed their will 
to the implacable machine. They have lost their 
soul in its grinding," says Mr. Gleason. "Our 
part" in the war, so far as the book describes 
it, is necessarily nothing further than the volun- 
tary part of the thirty thousand who did not wait 
for national action, for these chapters were 
written before the present energetic preparations 
for ending the war had fairly begun. But even 
so there was enough to tell for the purposes of 
an animated and engrossing narrative. The 
author has seen service as an ambulance man, 
and is now special correspondent in the war 
zone. 

A SEASONAL INDUSTRY. By Mary Van 
Kleeck. Russell Sage Foundation; $1.50. 
The trade of making women's hats is interest- 
ing not alone because 134,000 people in this 
country are employed in it, more than one-tenth 
of whom work in New York City alone. It is 
one of the most markedly seasonal of our indus- 
tries, is highly subject to sweating, is dependent 
upon the whims and fluctuations of fashion as 
few trades are, while organization of labor within 
its limits meets with few permanent successes and 
wages are relatively low. All these facts nat- 
urally lead to disturbed domestic conditions, low 
standards of living, and many other problems of 
social adjustment which are pressing. Miss Van 
Kleeck's handling of these problems is character- 
istic of her usual insight and thoroughness as 
the most experienced investigator of the condi- 
tions of women's work in this country. She 
brings a point of view and a directness of attack 
to her field of study which make her conclusions 
convincing. Especially is this true of her de- 
mand for some sort of effective public regulation 
of the trade in the interest of the welfare of 
the workers.

ALASKA: THE GREAT COUNTRY. By Ella 

Higginson. Macmillan; $2.50. 

One cannot read of Alaska without sharing 
the thrill of the Arctic traveller, and his feeling 
of the great, cold, wind-swept places, the high, 
snow-capped peaks, and the pounding surf. Mrs. 
Higginson 's descriptions and her photographs of 
fir-tipped points, of swirling rapids, Eskimos in 
their parkas, and dog teams harnessed for their 
run across the frozen spaces, all make one long 
poignantly for bracing northern air and life 
among hardy, simple people. She has travelled 
from Dixon Entrance north along the coast out 
to the far Aleutian Islands and up to Nome. 
She has gone inland over the famous White Pass 
from Skagway to Lake Bennett and White 
Horse. To-day Skagway, like Dawson, is a 
peaceful, dull, respectable little town. But in the 
nineties Lake Bennett was a scene of wonder. 
As Cyanide Bill described it to the author, 
"Tents! Did you say tents? Hunh! They was so 
thick it took a man an hour to find his own." 

Settlers other than gold-seekers are commonly 
repelled from Alaska by the poor reputation of 
its climate. But Alaska in reality offers fruitful 
opportunity to the farmer, its prevailing damp- 
ness making for an almost unequalled luxuriance 
of vegetation. Nothing, in fact, is niggardly in 
Alaska, neither the prices nor the generosity 
and cordiality of the people. Moreover, with 
its background of Russian ownership and Rus- 
sian luxury, with the history of the early ad- 
venturers around its difficult shores, with the 
achievements of the missionaries, and the min- 
gling of native races, Alaska offers a rich field 
for the historian and the anthropologist. 

THE BIBLE'S PROSE EPIC OF EVE AND HER 

SONS: the "J" Stories of Genesis. By Eric 

S. Robertson. Putnam; $1.75. 

Mr. Robertson apparently had several ends 
in view when writing this work, and he has at- 
tained them with varying degrees of success. In 
the first place, as the title indicates, he wished to 
study the "J" document of Genesis (those parts 
where God is spoken of as Jahveh) as an epic. 
He frequently speaks of it as a "morality play" 
and of its author as a "dramatist." Admitting 
willingly that the events recorded are mythologi- 
cal, not historical, he tries to show what the 
author meant to teach by these myths. Such 
is certainly the way in which the document ought 
to be studied, but the author has not always suc- 
ceeded, nor is he always consistent with the gen- 
eral principles laid down at the beginning. Thus, 
in his chapters on Abraham, he discusses at length 
recent theories about Ur of the Chaldees and 
the laws of Hammurabi ; it is as though a mod- 
ern commentator on "Hiawatha" should try to 



show the poet's meaning by quoting the latest 
discoveries of anthropologists, for it is certain 
that the author of "J" knew no more of Ham- 
murabi than Longfellow knew of the "Report 
of the American Bureau of Ethnology for 1917." 
In the chapter on Eve, on the other hand, the 
original sin of our first parents is interpreted in 
a way which certainly never occurred to the 
"dramatist" or anybody else previous to Philo 
the Jew. Secondly, the author has attempted to 
sketch the early history of the Hebrews. He 
has assembled a number of odds and ends, espe- 
cially from Robertson Smith and Sayce, which 
are not widely known, and which are most in- 
teresting. This part of the book is not carefully 
done, however, and there is no attempt to make 
a systematic study of the early Hebrews. On 
reading the book, one gets the impression that all 
this paraphernalia of scholarship is merely a pass- 
port to recommend the book to modern readers, 
while the author's real interest lies in moralizing 
and exegesis of the time-honored variety which 
allows one to deduce anything under the sun 
from no matter what text. Examples of this are 
found on every page. But when the author starts 
talking on his own account, he really does say 
many original and interesting things. Thus, in 
one chapter, he discusses the question of mar- 
riage apropos of Eve in a most unprejudiced 
manner and makes many excellent remarks on 
the subject. In another chapter he discusses 
temperance in the same spirit. Elsewhere, he lays 
the blame for the origin of war on private prop- 
erty. The results of his exegesis are excellent, 
but his method, though he dignifies it with the 
title of "reconstructive criticism," is that of the 
old-fashioned preacher. Why did he not simply 
write a book on "Wine, Women, and War," 
and leave the "J" document to the archaeologists 
and folklorists to whom it belongs? 

CONDITIONS OF LABOR IN AMERICAN IN- 
DUSTRIES. By W. Jett Lauck and Edgar 
Sydenstricker. Funk & Wagnalls; $1.75. 
In recent years elaborate investigations by the 
federal government, the various states, and pri- 
vate agencies have disclosed an enormous amount 
of information relative to labor and its prob- 
lems. Usually, however, the separate reports are 
practically inaccessible to the majority of people, 
and therefore some summary of these studies has 
a place in sociological literature. The purpose of 
this book is to meet this particular need. The au- 
thors used nearly thirty different investigations 
and reports in the study of wages, which closes 
with the disquieting conclusion that before the war 
began two-thirds at least of all male wage-earners 
eighteen years of age and over earned less than 
$600 annually. The budget of the laboring 
man's family has been the subject of a number 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



351 



of important investigations. The tables presented 
deal chiefly with the sources of income and dis- 
tribution of expenditures. Among the significant 
conclusions are the following : the wages of many 
men must be supplemented by those of their 
wives and children; the income of the girl living 
at home is often a main factor in the family 
budget ; the high cost of living is forcing laborers 
to expend an increasing proportion of their in- 
come on food, since the subsistence wage has 
risen about $200 since 1900. The authors as- 
sert that the increased cost of living has largely 
nullified the advantage of higher wages. The 
book does not attempt to pass upon the validity 
of the information presented in the various re- 
ports used but generally accepts the statistics as 
trustworthy. 

ENGLISH DOMESTIC RELATIONS, 1487- 
1653. By Chilton Latham Powell. Co- 
lumbia University Press; $1.50. 
The subject of matrimonial relations appears 
to possess a perennial interest and certain recent 
studies have added much to our knowledge of the 
long history of the human family and to the 
appreciation and understanding of its many per- 
plexing problems. The most recent scholar to 
venture into this field is Dr. Chilton Latham 
Powell, of Johns Hopkins University, who be- 
gins his investigation with the publication of 
Caxton's "Booke of Good Manners" in 1487 and 
closes his work with Cromwell's divorce legisla- 
tion in 1653. The title-page of Dr. Powell's 
book promises "a study of matrimony and fam- 
ily life in theory and practice as revealed by the 
literature, law, and history of the period"; but 
the performance is scarcely equal to the promise. 
The second half of the volume deals with the 
literature of the subject and, though the author 
discusses a number of important but little-known 
writings, this part of the work is scarcely more 
than a critical bibliography. The important part 
of the study comprises the first three chapters, 
in which the author discusses the history and 
law of marriage in England, the development of 
opinion as to the nature of the family institution, 
attempts at divorce legislation, and kindred sub- 
jects. The field was harvested a dozen years 
ago with some thoroughness by Professor How- 
ard in his monumental "History of Matrimonial 
Institutions" ; but Dr. Powell has discovered sev- 
eral unused literary sources and has been able to 
correct Professor Howard's conclusions on vari- 
ous important points. The author's most notable 
contribution is his discussion of the attitude of 
the different Puritan sects and factions toward 
the nuptial union: some were inclined to hold 
that marriage is most properly solemnized in the 
presence of the Christian congregation; but the 
Independents took the extreme position that mar- 



riage is a civil contract and nothing more. Of 
peculiar interest is Dr. Powell's conclusion as to 
Milton's well-known attitude toward the ques- 
tion of marriage and divorce: he shows conclu- 
sively that this did not originate in the poet's 
own domestic unhappiness but was a matter of 
conviction and was in complete agreement with 
the Independent thought of the period. 

THE RUSSIAN PROBLEM. By Paul Vino- 

gradoff. Dutton; 75 cts. 

"History is not a science enabling us to pre- 
dict coming events with exactness, but it does 
make a significant difference whether we con- 
sider facts of social life as detached experiences or 
as links in a chain of development. In the first 
instance we shall hardly have anything to guide 
us but the impressions and appetites of the mo- 
ment. In the second, we are able to obtain a 
wide perspective and a basis for rational plans." 
So, Professor Vinogradoff on the second page of 
his study of the psychology of the Russian people 
and their future after the war. And he goes on : 
"I may add that whatever may have been the 
shortcomings and the blunders of the Russian 
government, it is a blessing in this decisive crisis 
that Russians should have a firmly-knit organi- 
sation and a traditional centre of authority in 
the power of the Tsar. The present Emperor 
stands as the national leader, not in the his- 
trionic attitude of a War Lord, but in the quiet 
dignity of his office. He has said and done the 
right thing, and his subjects will follow him to a 
man." Is it necessary to add that this book was 
written before the Revolution? The facts have 
written their own ironic comment on the mar- 
gins of almost every page. 

THE MINIMUM COST OF LIVING: A Study 
of Families of Limited Income in New York 
City. By Winifred Stuart Gibbs. Macmil- 
lan; $1. 

In this day even a formal budgetary study of 
living-costs may be of interest. Miss Gibbs, 
supervisor of the home-economics work of the 
New York A. I. G. P., studied the living con- 
ditions and family expenditures of seventy-five 
widows and their three to five children for one 
year, in order that she might be able to advise 
the poor with reference to wiser expenditures 
and planning of meals. Good results were seen 
in the improvement of health in these families 
as a result of the better balancing of diet and the 
diminished use of tea and coffee a serious drain 
upon the purses of the poor without adequate 
returns in energy, especially in the children. 
Miss Gibbs presents elaborate schedules and ta- 
bles illustrating her methods of study and the 
results of her investigations.

Basil Stewart's "On Collecting Japanese Colour- 
Prints" (Dodd, Mead; $2.) is intended for the 
amateur who is starting a collection, and as such 
it is a satisfactory handbook. The author gives 
a brief survey of the history and production of 
prints, mentioning only the better-known artists. 
In the cases of Hokusai and Hiroshige the various 
series, states, and editions are enumerated. The 
book contains much useful information, and ought 
to arouse those who are interested in collecting to 
a realization of the fact that the art of color 
printing in Japan is to-day a lost art and that 
it is their privilege as collectors to preserve the 
products of that art and to carry forward its best 
traditions to the future. 

Those wishing to have the President's recent 
messages in convenient form will find that Stanton 
and Van Vliet's volume, "President Wilson's Great 
Speeches," is excellently suited to their need. Not 
only are the messages to Congress since the 
declaration of war included, but also a number of 
the President's speeches on other occasions which 
are most significant in showing his attitude toward 
the principles involved in the world crisis. A valu- 
able feature of the book is the collection of import- 
ant notes passing between this country and foreign 
powers, as well as the speeches on the occasions of 
the visits of the several foreign commissions in 
this country. (Stanton and Van Vlict, Chi- 
cago; $1.) 

Dr. William J. Long, whose "English Litera- 
ture" and "American Literature" are engagingly 
written and popular handbooks, has issued a one- 
volume "Outlines of English and American Lit- 
erature" (Ginn; $1.40). While the new work is 
briefer than the others, giving about 340 pages 
to English writers and 200 to American, it is not 
a mere condensation; it covers the ground afresh. 
It has the same general qualities as its predecessors, 
including excellent illustrations. It is presumably 
intended for use in high schools. 

Newell L. Sims is professor of sociology and 
political science in the University of Florida. His 
book, "Ultimate Democracy and Its Making" 
(McClurg; $1.50), is a compound of lectures de- 
livered in and about New York City. It is well 
written, modestly and smoothly, yet it covers 
much, from Aristotle to Henry Ford, the philan- 
thropist. Professor Sims is well read in the mod- 
erns, notably Giddings, Croly, and Veblen. He has 
hopes but recognizes all the old weaknesses of 
democracy, opposed as it is by "a compact body 
with great unanimity of purpose and action 
Ignorance, Indifference, Unsocialized Individual- 
ism, Love of Inequality, Militarism, Aristocracy, 
Autocracy, and all the rest of them." Few will 
read Giddings, Croly, or even Veblen all through, 
and here is a way to supply the deficiency. Pro- 
fessor Sims quotes excellently. 

The association of the physician with the clergy- 
man no longer brings a sense of surprise, since 
the initiation of the Emmanuel Movement some 
years ago. It is in the spirit of that work that 



Dr. L. W. Batten records his experiences in a 
simple but systematic treatise, "The Relief of Pain 
by Mental Suggestion" (Moffat, Yard; $1.25). 
The double intention of the work appears in the 
reconciliation of interest in Christ's service as a 
healer with modern mental therapeutics. Both the 
book and the movement which Dr. Batten repre- 
sents arc free from extreme positions, and express 
a commonsense appreciation of the kinds of ail- 
ments aided by mental methods. While not ex- 
tending the knowledge of the subject very far, the 
work is acceptable as a modest contribution. 

"If one has anything to say, one might as well 
put it into a chair," said Mr. Le Gallienne. And 
if he has anything to eat, why not eat it in a beau- 
tiful dining room, or if he would dream, why not 
do it in a room decorated with the stuff of which 
dreams are made? But it is not every builder who 
knows how to put two beautiful things together 
without destroying their beauty or to construct 
dreams out of the material of which they are to 
be made. William Francklyn Paris's "Decorative 
Elements in Architecture" (Lane; $5.) appeals to 
the layman as a gem. It is descriptive, historic, and 
didactic, and written in a style which a layman 
can understand. The illustrations, of which there 
are ninety and nine, really illustrate. They are 
apt in selection and superb in execution. The 
author, the engraver, the printer, and the pub- 
lisher may all well be proud of this volume. 

John Dryden Kuser's "The Way to Study Birds" 
(Putnam's; $1.25) is a didactic primer devised to 
acquaint the novice with the fifty most abundant 
kinds of birds to be found in the neighborhood of 
New York City. Its content is such that it may 
be used widely throughout the eastern and cen- 
tral states, and its method is applicable everywhere. 
The author sets forth briefly the haunts, descrip- 
tion, size, shape, call, seasonal abundance, and field- 
marks of the commoner birds, beginning with the 
ubiquitous English sparrow. The summer birds, 
the transients, and the winter birds are then 
treated. Directions for keeping notes, recording 
migrations, and learning bird songs, a partial list 
of books and a note on preservation and propaga- 
tion of our native birds widen the usefulness of 
this valuable ornithological primer. 

"Loyalty is obedience to the law," proclaims 
Charles G. Mutzenberg, author of "Kentucky's 
Famous Feuds and Tragedies" (Fenno; $1.25), 
and thereby misplaces the proper emphasis. Ken- 
tucky's feuds are, in any large sense, over. Some 
other traditional characteristics of the country are 
not but that is another story. The clan feuds are 
important to-day chiefly as a picturesque memory, 
an echo from the past, that it is interesting to 
recall when you happen to shake hands with a 
Callahan or talk with a Howard, a Turner, or a 
Tolliver. Their history illuminates the character 
of the present-day "citizen"; it does not afford 
justifiable grounds for a polemic against his an- 
cestors who made their own law and abode by it. 
It is a little ridiculous to exclaim against the dis- 
loyalty of a people who sent their entire able- 
bodied male population to defend the Union.

NOTES ON NEW FICTION 



Any story-writer who has the luck to be recom- 
mended by Joseph Conrad will get attention, 
but he will have to stand a more searching scru- 
tiny than if he had offered himself unannounced. 
A certain standard is expected of him, and merely 
good work will hardly do. On the jacket of 
Richard Curie's "The Echo of Voices" (Knopf; 
$1.50) Mr. Conrad commends the publisher for 
his enterprise: "I think your taking him up is 
a good move. He has brains; he has a writer's 
temperament. There's a lot in him." So there 
is. The temperament in particular is interesting 
and the eyes through which Mr. Curie views our 
world are fresh and penetrating. There is per- 
haps more than a suggestion of Mr. Conrad's 
own method, and more than a trace of the influ- 
ence of the great Russians, especially Dostoevsky. 
But what then? These are are no bad models 
for a young writer with a temperament, and 
Mr. Curie has had the strength to put his 
individual stamp on all but one of these tales. 
Mr. Curie is fond of rogues, the smooth, round, 
over-elegant, masterful men on the fringe of 
things who manipulate other people's money, 
and he is fond of interesting failures, men with 
or without brains who, through some flaw in 
the stuff of which they are made, are doomed to 
go down. He is interested also in the lives of 
quite drab people, and knows how to write their 
shabby little tragedies in just the right key. It 
is interesting to see how much, for once, can 
be made of that motiveless malice which inspires 
quite half the unkindness in the world. Malice 
fascinates Mr. Curie, and it gets to fascinate us, 
too, as we read ; it is not intruded but it is always 
there in the most casual relations, the sand on 
the axle of smooth intercourse. And it has abso- 
lutely no meaning, none whatever ; it does no one 
any good. Mr. Curie has already the skill of 
the master in getting under way, snaring the in- 
terest; he can sketch a character in a sentence or 
a phrase, and his control over natural human 
speech serves him almost everywhere. The 
traces of his novitiate are not, however, com- 
pletely obliterated as yet: he does not always 
sustain the interest to the end, and in some of 
the stories there is that progressive decline which 
indicates that the writer is losing confidence in 
himself and in his power to hold the reader. 
Neither can Mr. Curie always quite rise at the 
climax to the high level of excellence which the 
tale as a whole maintains, and since he is a seri- 
ous workman, relying not at all upon tricks but 
holding you only by the veracity of what he 
has to show, the disappointment is proportion- 
ately keen. "The Echo of Voices" is an achieve- 
ment which will make those who read it wait 
eagerly for the next book by Mr. Curie. 



Is it because of our idealization of worldly 
success that American novels are so richly en- 
dowed with money and motors and the spin- 
ning wheels of invisible, but highly profitable, 
commerce? To indicate that "Cousin Julia," 
by Grace Hodgson Flandrau (Appleton; $1.40), 
is inconsiderable would be most unfair, and 
yet its lack of depth and subtlety, traceable, 
possibly, to American social experience, is re- 
deemed only by vivid coloring and skilful 
arrangement of detail. The characters are thin 
but unmistakably American, their chances for 
development too often avoided in favor of clever 
bits of local color. Yet the book is more than 
readable; its charming pictures of the middle 
West and its sardonic understanding of the 
Cinderella background of les nouveaux help to 
point a shrewd moral. For suppose that the 
manager of all our destinies, the American 
mother, marries her favorite daughter to a French 
marquis, should the other daughter refuse to 
marry a millionaire who could finance them all? 

Out of the heat of Africa, from camel-tracked 
Sidi-bel-Abbes, comes a story of the Foreign 
Legion of France that for sheer adventure and 
hardy romance could hardly be excelled. 
Scorched by the sun, the Legion scrubs its clothes 
in the paved reservoir, eats its monotonous din- 
ner in cell-like barracks, and spends its half- 
penny a day riotously in the cafes of Sidi-bel- 
Abbes. In his "Wages of Virtue" (Stokes; 
$1.50) Captain Percival C. Wren has made a 
contribution to the literature of adventure. Out 
of all civilizations and from all countries come 
the members of the Legion, and their diversity 
of character and purpose is astounding. Whether 
or not you notice an overdrawing of the Ameri- 
can's dialect, a self-consciousness in occasional epi- 
grammatic turns of phrase, or an excess of high 
lights, your admiration is held throughout. 

Six years ago Mrs. Alfred Sidgwick's book, 
"Salt of the Earth" (Watt; $1.40), could hardly 
have been written. To-day it will find hundreds 
of eager readers. Think of all you have read 
of the despoiled chateaux of the Marne country ; 
all you have heard of Kultur; add your recollec- 
tions of the group of Prussian officers who sat 
at the next table to you in Berlin, and you will 
have made your own prologue to the book. It 
is a chronicle of hate for Prussianism, well 
thought out and presented. An English girl, 
carried off her feet by the passion of a young 
German officer, marries him and the rest of his 
family in a moment of romance. Before the 
end of the wedding-trip his insolence and arro- 
gance have awakened her to his tyranny. From 
this point we see him as we are accustomed to 
seeing our enemy across the trenches, brutal, 
insensitive, greedy, unrestrained, a product of

Kultur. Such international marriage tragedies 
are not unknown. The fact that a book of this 
sort can be so well written, so credibly assembled, 
is a commentary on the fact that we are at war. 
Formerly most of us should have accepted the 
quiet gardens and thatched, stork-crowned roofs 
of Heidelberg and grown contemptuous of the 
rest. 

A well-written story of boyhood never fails to 
find favor with grown-ups. Howard Brubaker 
has been a real boy, but more to the point, he 
has the faculty of making his readers boys again. 
"Ranny" (Harper; $1.40) is excellent reading. 

Perhaps a natural reaction from the depres- 
sions of war is an excess of frivolity. Three of 
the autumn novels indicate such a mood among 
the writers. Cosmo Hamilton's "Scandal" (Lit- 
tle, Brown; $1.50), need be taken no more 
seriously than the fashion-plates in a popular 
magazine. Apparently wearied with the virtu- 
ously blind, he now turns his pen to the por- 
trayal of those who have no such flaw in their 
vision. This is a "society" story. Everyone is 
fabulously rich, or appears to be. Only one of 
the characters is supposed to have red blood, and 
he is trapped into matrimony by the heroine, who 
in order to avoid the scandal consequent upon an 
innocent indiscretion coolly announces that she 
has secretly married him. Those having a taste 
for the sort of stories usually told over the cigars, 
after the women have left the room, will enjoy 
this bit of journalese. Something of the same 
situation provides Alice Duer Miller with mate- 
rial for "Ladies Must Live" (Century; $1.25). 
But Miss Miller is less highly seasoned with 
scandal and writes with frank humor of social 
pirates and their tricks. She seems to have drawn 
her characters from life rather than society jour- 
nals and exhibits genuine wit in their handling. 
Louise Maunsell Field's new novel, "The 
Little Gods Laugh" (Little, Brown; $1.40), is 
about the people of whom one reads in the 
"society" columns. There is some clever charac- 
terization, but that is not a sufficient excuse for 
the addition of one more novel to the already 
overlong list of American mediocrities. 

The story of a salt-air castle or two down on 
Cape Cod, where you can buy oilskins and fish- 
hooks and kerosene and calico after supper if you 
want to, is the gist of James A. Cooper's "Cap'n 
Abe, Storekeeper" (Sully & Kleinteich; $1.25). 
The fog is real fog, and the breakers are really 
the Atlantic, and it was really a case of love at 
first sight. If your last trip to the Cape has 
lost any of that delicious odor of clams and sea- 
weed that clung even to your shoelaces, you 
can get a new whiff of it here, with a great deal 
of pleasure. 



<-.\M VI. COMMTN I 



MRS. KATHARINE FULLERTON GBROULD 
comes down very hard on the younger British 
novelists in the current "Yale Review." The, 
write precisely alike; it isn't possible to tell Mr. 
Lawrence from Mr. Beresford or Mr. Walpole 
from Compton Mackenzie. They take in one 
another's washing, so to speak, and wear one an- 
other's clothes. They all bear organized society 
a grudge ; they are bent on changing things with- 
out stopping to have definite ideas about what 
changes are likely to work. They are obsessed 
with sex and yet they create if you can call it 
creation odious women. Their heroines are 
huzzies or morons often enough they are both. 
Mr. Bennett himself is no better in that respect. 
Look at Hilda Lessways! "Hilda is never a 
nice girl; she is a monster from the start and 
to the finish." As for Mr. Wells he has bene- 
fitted by the steadying force of an interest in so- 
cial problems, and "his reward for having been 
perpetually occupied with them is to have won 
through to 'The Research Magnificent' and 'Mr. 
Britling.' ' Mr. Britling gives you, so to speak, 
your cue and prepares you nicely for this judg- 
ment at the end "it will take more than Mr. 
Walpole to make Russians credible to me. He 
seems to me no more plausible than Dostoievsky, 
and far, far short of Turgenev." This is the 
kind of faint praise that will rejoice Mr. Wal- 
pole and Mr. Mackenzie. To fail with Dos- 
toevsky, and, inferentially, in the same manner, 
is the shining goal to which half the young Eng- 
lishmen now writing strain their eyes. 



BEFORE us ON THE TABLE lies the second edi- 
tion of the pamphlet of the Committee on Labor 
of the Advisory Commission of the Council of 
National Defence. It was organized on April 
2, with a membership of one hundred and fifty, 
and it has grown, at the present writing, to the 
plethoric number of five hundred, circa. Its pro- 
gramme is not pretentious, and the pamphlet 
speaks of sub-committees "whose plans are fur- 
thest advanced," particularly those in relation to 
wages and hours and mediation and conciliation. 
The programme pledges the committee to the 
maintenance of industrial standards existing be- 
fore our country entered the war, changes to be 
permitted only when national safety, in the judg- 
ment of the Council of Defence, demands them. 
The chairman of the committee is the well-known 
Mr. Samuel Gompers. Now the interesting 
thing about the committee is this: since its for- 
mation, strikes have multiplied in important war 
industries. In some parts of the West there has 
existed a state of industrial warfare. And on 
the whole and everywhere labor conditions prom-

ise to become worse rather than better. Yet the 
committee has not assembled since its organiza- 
tion. None of its sub-committees, not even those 
whose work is "advanced," has had anything to 
offer by way of protest or programme. Whatever 
work has been done, has been done by depart- 
mental mediators, by special departmental com- 
mittees, or by the spoken word of President Wil- 
son. It is, however, true that Mr. Gompers has 
made many speeches in many places. Contem- 
plation of the committee's pamphlet and of its 
record brings to mind the historic question of 
Lord Dundreary, when he was one day over- 
whelmed with a sense of the futility of earthly 
things: "Why," he sighed, "ah, why is a hen?" 



THE BLESSED WORD "MESOPOTAMIA" is the 

recorded ancestor of a line of such blessings, 
whose most recent and favored progeny is the 
blessed word "Creative." Since M. Bergson 
joined it to Evolution, it has had a distinguished, 
if rather confusing, series of mates. The prag- 
matists have set it before Intelligence, and 
dancers and other vaudevillains have joined it 
with their own pet substantives. In various in- 
stantaneous and futurist magazines Mr. Willard 
Huntington Wright descants on all sorts of crea- 
tive newness, and in the town of Baraboo, 
Achille Lesceaux, tonsorial artist, announces 
Creative Haircutting. M. Lesceaux justifies his 
announcement with the philosophy of Benedetto 
Croce and Joel Elias Spingarn. The latter has 
written a book, "Creative Criticism," in which, 
particularly, M. Lesceaux declares, he has found 
his vindication and exposition. For if, as the 
book so truly and eloquently declares, all art is 
expression, and nothing but expression, and if the 
difference between good art and bad art is the 
mere difference between successful and unsuc- 
cessful expression, there can, first of all, be no 
reason for the snobbish and mid- Victorian exclu- 
sion of the tonsorialist from the fellowship of the 
imagists, cubists, and creative critics. Haircut- 
ting, M. Lesceaux insists, is also expression. Fur- 
thermore, according to the creative critic, the ex- 
pression is indifferent to its material; its success 
or failure must be measured by the intention of 
the Expressor ; and the less obstruction a material 
offers this intention, the more perfect the ex- 
pression. God, who meets no obstruction what- 
soever, creating, indeed, as in a vacuum, is most 
perfectly self-expressive, and the conditions un- 
der which the tonsorialist works, at least in 
Baraboo, M. Lesceaux submits, are, of all that 
obstruct the artist, nearest to God's own. M. 
Lesceaux is, however, reluctant to press too hard 
his claim to admission to the fellowship of crea- 
tive artists. He is restrained by the irrefutable 



demonstration of the creative critic that the artist 
expresses only himself, that as an artist he is 
self-sufficient, independent, whole, an Individ- 
ual! His public is as indifferent as his material. 
His expression is a soliloquy, not a communica- 
tion. With certain theatrical managers, he may 
declare, Prometheus-like, "The public be 
damned!" But a tonsorialist, even a master of 
Creative Haircutting, may not altogether do this. 
One thing more troubles M. Lesceaux. He ob- 
serves that the Individuals whose Art is Self- 
Expression seek lucre and praise and reputation 
for their soliloquies, and that "Creative Criti- 
cism" is among books on sale. 



THE MODERNS put their best foot forward 
in the "Modern Library" series now being 
issued at a modest price by Messrs. Boni 
and Liveright. The moderns are not alone, of 
course, for Schopenhauer comes in and so does 
Samuel Butler, but both have worn well and 
seem to exhale a distinctly modern note. Who- 
ever edited the series has a decided flair, for there 
is scarcely a title that fails to awaken interest or 
stir memories not too quiescent. In the list at 
hand, the dead who were chosen appear to have 
been largely those who still cast their spell most 
strongly over the young generation Nietzsche, 
Ibsen, Turgenev, Strindberg, Meredith, and, 
with diminishing force perhaps, Maupassant. 
Among the living we have Anatole France, 
Shaw, Wells, Chesterton, George Moore, James 
Stephens, and Lord Dunsany a thoroughly 
representative list distinguished throughout by a 
discriminating choice of titles. The series is 
doubly welcome at a time when the pinch of high 
prices threatens to curtail the book-lover's pleas- 
ures. 

THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED in the cause of 
literature and art in America will regret that 
"The Seven Arts," which made so valiant a start 
under the direction of a group of vigorous young 
New York writers, has been obliged to suspend 
publication. Its loss is one of the upsets caused 
by the war. When the editors were faced with 
the alternative of modifying the policy of free 
discussion they had announced or of losing finan- 
cial support, they very properly declined to sub- 
mit to dictation, feeling that without complete 
independence they could do little to further 
either critical taste or sound sense. By arrange- 
ment with the editors, THE DIAL has under- 
taken to fill the unexpired subscriptions, and 
since readers of "The Seven Arts" will find some 
of their friends among the regular contribu- 
tors to THE DIAL, we hope that they will not 
feel they have been thrown among strangers.

HOW TO STUDY 
ARCHITECTURE 

By Charles Henry Caffin 

Author of "Art for Life's Sake" tic. 

This new volume treats of architecture 
as a living art, growing out of both the 
needs and the ideals of life. It traces the 
course of civilization in its particular rela- 
tion to architecture and the development of 
architecture in response to man's progress in 
civilization. It will stir the reader to a liv- 
ing interest in that art of all others most 
closely identified with the practical necessi- 
ties and the external beauty of life. With 
its abundance of carefully chosen illustra- 
tions it is of value and interest to the gen- 
eral reader as well as to the student.

The valuable library of Henry Bell, of Bridge- 
port, Conn., was recently purchased by Charles F. 
Heartman, of 36 Lexington Avenue, New York. 
Mr. Bell, who is now seventy years of age, was 
formerly mayor of Bridgeport. The library was 
particularly rich in books and pamphlets relating 
to Connecticut, old and modern. It contained his- 
tories of all the towns and cities of the state except 
about twenty. There were about 2000 pamphlets 
and 1000 bound books. The books Mr. Heart- 
man sold to Lathrop C. Harper, of New York, 
who said that they were one of the finest collec- 
tions of Connecticut items that he had seen. The 
pamphlets Mr. Heartman kept for himself. Among 
them are a large number of rarities, including many 
items relating to Yale College. 

One of the most interesting things in the library 
was a complete set of the Hartford "American 
Mercury." At the back of this bound volume were 
no less than seventeen newspapers, printed in 1799 
or 1800, with notices of the death of George Wash- 
ington. Some of them gave his farewell address. 
Among the papers were two printed at Newark, 
N. J., one at Trenton, two in Vermont, one at 
Portland, Me., one at Salem, Mass., two at Hart- 
ford, Conn., one at Stonington, Conn., and two in 
towns in the upper part of New York State. It 
is seldom that so much material relating to Wash- 
ington's death is found in a library. 

Stan. V. Henkels, of 1304 Walnut Street, Phila- 
delphia, announces that he is on the eve of his 
fiftieth year as an auctioneer. Among the sales 
he will hold this fall are those of the miscellaneous 
library belonging to J. Levering Jones, of Phila- 
delphia, and rare Americana belonging to John C. 
Brady, of South Carolina. The Jones sale will 
take place on October 11 and 12 and the Brady 
sale on October 18. Mr. Henkels is also pre- 
paring to sell the library and oil paintings belong- 
ing to the late John G. Watmough, of Philadelphia. 
With hardly an exception the books are hand- 
somely bound by specialists. The paintings include 
examples of Corot, Rico, Jacque, Delattre, Berne- 
Bcllecour, Daubigny, Schreyer, Gonzales, Van 
Marcke, Escosura, Herzog, Ziem, Diaz, De Haas, 
Cormon, and Braith. 

Mr. Henkels is now preparing the catalogue for 
the sale of autograph letters and manuscripts 
gathered by Frederick M. Steele, of Chicago, and 
now belonging to Mrs. Ella P. Steele, of Los 
Angeles, California. The collection embraces some 
10,000 letters and manuscripts. The catalogue will 
be issued in four parts. Included in the collection 
is a set of the signers of the Declaration of Inde- 
pendence. There are also letters of signers of the 
Federal Constitution, members of the Continental 
Congress, generals in the Revolution and the Civil 
War, and presidents of the United States. More 
than 1000 poems by British and American poets 
are included. On October 23 autograph and his-

torical documents belonging to John R. Craigie and 
others will be sold. Other sales will include the 
library of T. F. Ritchey, of Tionesta, Pa., and his- 
torical oil paintings from the collection of Charles 
F. Gunther, of Chicago, and other collectors. There 
will be oil portraits of Washington by Rembrandt 
Peale, Wright, and others; of Charles Cotesworth 
Pinckney, Andrew Jackson, Charles Kemble, by 
Sully; John Spears by Major John Andre; minia- 
ture of Louis XVI by Charles Willson Peale; 
Henry Clay and Daniel Webster by John Naegle. 

Patrick F. Madigan, of New York, has pur- 
chased a collection of autograph letters by Count 
Leo N. Tolstoy. They are in English and in Rus- 
sian, and were written from a village in the Govern- 
ment of Ryazan, where he was living in a peasant 
cottage and feeding the people during the great 
famine of 1891-92. Letters by Tolstoy are scarce, 
especially in English. There are also some letters 
by his wife, the Countess Tolstoy, in the collec- 
tion. Mr. Madigan has also purchased the original 
autograph manuscript of Walt Whitman's famous 
poem, "Thanks in Old Age," and interesting letters 
by Thomas Jefferson and John Brown. The Jef- 
ferson letter is as follows: 

Washington City, 

February 1803. 
Sir 

In compliance with a request of the House of Repre- 
sentatives of the United States, as well as with a 
sense of what is necessary, I take the liberty of urg- 
ing on you the importance and indispensible necessity 
of vigorous exertions, on the part of the State govern- 
ments, to carry into effect the militia system adopted 
by the national legislature, agreeably to the powers 
reserved to the states respectively, by the constitution 
of the United States; and in a manner the best calcu- 
lated to ensure such a degree of military discipline, 
and knowledge of tactics, as will, under the auspices 
of a benign providence, render the militia a sure and 
permanent bulwark of national defense. 

None but an armed nation can dispense with a 
standing army, to keep ours armed and disciplined, 
is therefore at all times important; but especially so 
at a moment when rights the most essential to our 
welfare have been violated, and an infraction of 
treaty committed without colour or pretext, and al- 
though we are willing to believe that this has been 
the act of a subordinate agent only, yet is it wise to 
prepare for the possibility that it may have been the 
leading measure of a system. While therefore we are 
endeavoring and with a considerable degree of con- 
fidence to obtain by friendly negotiation a peaceable 
redress of the inquiry, and effectual provision against 
its repitition, let us array the strength of the nation, 
and be ready to do with promptitude and effect what- 
ever a regard to justice and our future security may 
require. 

In order that I may have a full and correct view 
of the resources of our country in all its different 
parts, I must desire you, with as little delay as possi- 
ble, to have me furnished with a return of the 
militia, and of the arms and accoutrements of your 
state, and of the several counties, or other geographi- 
cal divisions of it. Accept assurances of my high 
consideration and respect. TH. JEFFERSON. 

The Brown letter is written to Simon Perkins, 
Akron, O., and is as follows: 

Springfield, Mass. 17th March, 
1848.

Friend Perkins, 
Dear Sir: 

When I wrote you last I promised to give 
you some further particulars, in regard to our busi- 
ness, soon. At the time I thought matters were so 
arranged with Burlington that we should have no 
further trouble with them; and we have got $10,000. 
in acceptances most of which we have got discounted. 
This helps a little for the present but the prospect 
is dull about getting the matter closed before the 
opening of navigation; which however we look for 
soon; as we have had but very little winter. We 
have some 20 or 30 thousand Ibs. of fine wool not 
contracted away and we think there is some prospect 
that we may have to put it down some to realize the 
cash on it. Money is still very tight and manufac- 
turers talk quite as poor as usual. I am not yet 
able to set a time exactly when we can refund the 
money you have advanced but should be glad to 
know when you will probably need it. We have 
now got so much into our hands from the Burlington 
Co. that I think there is no reason to fear their flying 
off the handle. Were it otherwise I do not believe 
we should be able to hold them as I think they would 
raise tome excuse that the wool was not so fine, or 
not so clean, or that they were to take none but what 
was delivered before the close of navigation, or 
some other pretext to get rid of taking it. As it now 
stands we have some $17,000. in our hands more 
than will pay for all the wool they have yet received. 

RICHARD LB GALLIBNNB. 
(To the Editor of THB DIAL.) 

In your "Notes for Bibliophiles" will you please 
inform me of the date of publication in separate 
form of "The Cry of the Little Peoples," by Rich- 
ard Le Gallienne, issued by the Roycrofters. In- 
quiries of the publishers failed to bring any definite 
information; in fact, their first reply to my inquiry 
stated they had not published it. A second letter 
acknowledged their mistake, but they were unable 
to give a date. The poem was originally printed 
in "The Daily Chronicle," London (Ene.), Tune 
23, 1899. 

Can you or any of your readers add any items 
to the following list of rarities by R. Le Gallienne : 

I. Four-page leaflet containing three poems, in- 
serted in some copies of "English Poems," London, 
1892. 

II. Limited Editions: Confessio Amantis. Lon- 
don, 1893. 

III. Robert Burns. La port, 8vo. New York,

IV. Christmas. 8vo. London and Belfast, 18%.

VI. The Hidden Land. 1906. 

Any information regarding further items will be 
much esteemed.

Mr. Le Gallienne is unable to inform me of the 
date of publication of "The Cry of the Little

it was issued by them without consulting him. Per-

A New 'Book by Amy Lowell 

TENDENCIES IN 

MODERN AMERICAN 

POETRY 

By Amy Lowell 

In this new volume Miss Lowell again 
turns to criticism. For the first time, the 
new poetic renaissance is considered criti- 
cally and given a perspective. Taking six 
leading poets, each a type of one of the 
trends of contemporary verse, she has writ- 
ten a short biographical account of the 
man, and a critical summary of his work; 
relating him to the past, and showing the 
steps by which he left it to create the 
present. 

"It would be disagreeably obvious to 
call Miss Lowell's prose 'poetic.' Its style 
conceals style ; its sculptural simplicity has 
the regnant beauty of line. . . . Always 
she aims at the dominant attitude of each 
of her poets. . . . She achieves chisel- 
led imagery, the reflection in the mirror 
of words, of the clear, bright flame of 
immortal genius." Review of Reviews.

Are you helping in making the world

Your government is not asking you to give

Eric Fisher Wood, author of "The Notebook 
of an Intelligence Officer," published by the Cen- 
tury Co., was, early in the war, an attache of the 
American embassy in Paris; last Autumn he of- 
fered his services to England and was accepted. 
He has seen service in the navy and in the trenches, 
whence he was recently sent back wounded to an 
English hospital. He is now again at the front. 

The Stratford Co. announce that they will 
shortly begin the publication of a series of the 
world's classics at twenty-five cents the volume. 
The first five titles include: "Lazarus," by An- 
dreyev, and "The Gentleman from San Francisco," 
by Bunin, translated by A. Yarmolinsky; "Dc

"The President's Control of Foreign Relations" 
(Princeton University Press), which was erron- 
eously attributed to E. Baldwin Smith in THE 
DIAL'S Fall Announcement List of September 27, 
is by Edward S. Corwin, professor of politics in 
Princeton University. 

Mary Austin says of her recent novel "The 
Ford" (Houghton Mifflin): "The book records in- 
cidents in my own life in the struggle for the 
waters of Owens River which the city of Los 
Angeles stole from us. That was a very wicked 
episode and I did not begin to do justice to the 
chicanery of Los Angeles. I am saving some of 
those things for the sequel to 'The Ford'! It was 
I who discovered and made public the attempt of 
the city to secure the surplus rights of the River 
in just such fashion as I have described Anne and 
Kenneth Brent doing in the book." 

The New York Public Library has compiled a 
reading list under the title of "Patriotism," in 
which characters and countries, ancient and mod- 
ern, whose names are associated with the struggle 
for freedom are represented in the form of his- 
tories, biographies, and stories readable for boys 
and girls of high-school age. 

"Wilderness Honey" by Frank Lillie Pollock, is 
a story of Mr. Pollock's bees, which, during March 
and April, store honey from the swamp flowers in 
Alabama, and are then shipped to Canada, to work 
on clover and wild raspberry. The book is an- 
nounced by the Century Co. 

In "The Expansion of Europe," Professor Ram- 
say Muir discusses colonial development particu- 
larly in its relation to the outbreak of the war. 
A more intensive study of Africa, the crux of the 
colonial problem, is given in Professor Norman 
Dwight Harris's "Intervention and Colonization 
in Africa." Both books are from the Houghton 
Mifflin Press. 

Dr. William M. Salter, whose "Nietzsche, the

lishing, is a brother-in-law of the late William

The 

Substance of Gothic 

By Ralph Adams Cram, Litt.D., LL.D., etc. 

Crown 8<vo, gilt top, with portrait, $1.50 net. 

As the recognized authority on Gothic architecture, 
any book by Mr. Cram, whose work in connection 
with the West Point Military Academy and the superb 
St. Thomas Church in New York has achieved world- 
wide admiration, commands attention. This volume, 
however, has a very special interest to-day as it dis- 
cusses in a most illuminating manner the civilization 
of the Middle Ages and incidentally of our own 
period. It will be read with much interest not only 
by students of Gothic architecture, but by all who are 
thinking deeply of the present world crisis and of 
what is to come after.

The Editor 

is a weekly magazine for writers 

It is twenty-two yean old. Those who conduct it 
like to think of it aa a weekly visitor to ambitious 
writers, aa a visitor who must not be pretentious, 
not dull, but friendly and helpful Recognizing that 
writing may be an art. or a trade, or a profession 
what the writer himself makes it THE EDITOR 
tries to tell writers, so far aa such things may be 
taught, how to write stories, articles, verses and 
plays, etc. One thing it does, in a way that never 
haa been quailed, is to bring to the attention of 
writers new* of all the opportunities to sell their 
work. News of current prise competitions is a 
weakly feature. Editorials on copyright and authors' 
literary property rights are frequent. 

P. C. Macfarlane says that THE EDITOR'S lead- 
ing articles, which usually are written by Charles 
Leonard Moore, are the best essays on writing being 
published today. 

THE EDITOR has a department devoted to let- 
ters in which sucosasful contemporary writers tell 
of the genesis, development and writing of certain 
of their published stories. 

A yearly subscription (62 weekly numbers) costs 
$3.00. A four months' trial subscription cost* $1.00. 
Single copies are 10 eta. each.

THE MESSIAH OF THE CLYLINDER

striking picture of the logical result of "Kultur." Price $1.35.

a real story, strikingly realistic in its psychology of boy life, and full of fun and humor. The 
"city" is Chicago. Price $1.35.

mended to those who want to improve their game. Price $1.00.

Tuck-Me-In Stories

All of these stories are about animals, in the 
form of fables, though the moral is left for the 
child to draw. Mr. Comstock shows originality 
that amounts to genius in the simplicity of his style 
of both text and picture. The drawings are re- 
markably true to nature and are in no sense cari- 
catures. This is an unusually meritorious juvenile, 
one that is handsome in make-up and perfectly 
sound as literature and good reading. 8vo. Illus-

THE BEST FALL FICTION 



A First Novel of Amazing Power 

HELEN OF FOUR GATES 

The author of this extraordinary "first book" ii referred to as one of the most remarkable writers 
of recent years. 

The Dial says: "The qualities I like best in the story are qualities that are not modern that make 
a story whether it is a year or a hundred years old, live in our memories for its truth and its humor 
and its imagination, that give it poignancy and distinction." 

The New York Times says: "Has brought a new note to current fiction, a note that excels in sheer 
emotional power, in beauty of tone, in imagination any voice that is now telling stories to the Eng- 
lish speaking peoples." 

New York World says: "There are in print few pictures more impressive than those drawn by this 
unknown author." Net, $1.50 

The ENLIGHTENMENT of PAULINA By Ellen wukin. Tompkin. 

Author of "Th Egotisical F' 

When a woman marries for his money a man whom she despises and then suddenly finds herself 
the wife of a penniless criminal she has to face moral as well as social readjustments. Here is a 
vital sincere study of modern American life and the soul-growth of a self righteous, self seeking 
woman who came to understand by mingling closely in the home life of a small Southern town what 
human nature and loving kindness mean. Net, $1.50 



GONE TO EARTH 



By Mary Webb 



Author of "The Golden Arrow/' 

The New York Post says: "Fidelity to nature that marks the early character description of Gone to 
Earth and the mingling of humor and beauty in the novel is rarely well done. The picture of the 
half gypsy girl with tawny hair and the feet of a born dancer, with her pet fox and her kindness to 
all things; the sketch of the abstracted, callous old harper with whom she has no tie but one of 
blood will not be forgotten easily. Net, $1.50 



THE JOYFUL YEARS 

By F. T. Wawn Net, $1.50 

Philadelphia Pret says: "This is the love story 
of Cynthia and Peter, a beautiful story and beauti- 
fully told. There arc other people in the book whom 
we should like to meet but these only form a back- 
ground for the radiant figures of the young lovers." 

MY WIFE 

By Edward Burke Net, $1.60 

A story of family life narrated by the husband and 
father in which he almost succeeds in complicating 
two love affairs beyond remedy and has a narrow 
escape from disaster himself because he dallies with 
the (host of an old fascination. It is written in a 
breezy style and its satire is unsparing. 

THE MASTER OF THE HILLS 

67 Sarah Johnson Cock* Net, $1.50 

Richmond Tim** Di patch says: "Mrs. Cocke re- 
veals exceptional literary and dramatic ability and 
her interpretations of the thoughts and characters 
of the pure blooded Americans of the Virginia and 
Georgia mountain regions reveals an insight that is 
remarkable for its depth of feeling and discovering 
beautiful traits of character." 



THE ROYAL OUTLAW 

By Charles B. Hudson Net. $1.60 

A wonderful tale of fighting men laid in the timr 
of King David. Not since Ben Hur has such a 
novel appeared. New York Tribune: "No person

standing of those times and without being charmed 
with the vital human interest of the tale." 

DAY AND NIGHT STORIES

Author of "The Wave," "Juliu* LcVallon." 

New York Time* says: "From gay to grave, from 
horror to sarcasm, from philosophy to the most 
fanciful extravagance they range. They are the pro- 
duction of a man who sees with the eyes and writes 
with the sense of rhythm and of beauty of the bora 
past." 

WILLIAM BY THE GRACE OF GOD 

By Marjorie Bowen Net. $1.60 

New York Time* says: "Few events in history 
are more inspiring than the brave fight of the 
Netherlands against the mighty power of Spain with 
the victory at last won through the courage defeat 
could not quell, and few figures are as gallant as 
is that of William by the Grace of God."

James Douglas in the London Observer says: "Some unknown man of genius who calls himself 
Titzwater Wray' has translated the supreme novel of the War and here it is in its divine simplicity 
of truth, undraped and unbedizened. Truth of course is the summit of satire, the apex of irony 
and this journal of a platoon is the nude truth of war as it is seen by a common soldier who is also 
an artist and philosopher." 

Pitts bury Dispatch says: "A dose of modern war unsweetened." 

Boston Post says: "It is a book for those who want the truth." 

New York Tribune says: "An appalling account exposed in all its nakedness." Net, $1.50

Chinese Poet: Po-Chu-I 



By the kindness of Mr. A. D. Waley of 
the Print Room, British Museum, I have 
been permitted to see the proofs of his 
translation of thirty-eight poems by Po- 
Chu-I (A. D. 772-846), the great Chinese 
poet of the T'ang dynasty, as well as the 
manuscript of a volume of translations 
of pre-T'ang poems, whose publication 
has been delayed by the war. 

Some of my readers may know "A His- 
tory of Chinese Literature" and "Chinese 
Poetry in English Verse," two volumes 
by Professor H. A. Giles, the English 
scholar who has done so much to spread 
a knowledge of China and the Chinese in 
our incurious island. But valuable as are 
Professor Giles's renderings, I think that 
Mr. Waley's are superior by reason of 
their literal exactitude, through which we 
can apprehend intimately the spirit of the 
best Chinese poetry. Professor Giles per- 
haps was inclined to treat his subject a 
little too much in the mood of an enthu- 
siastic collector of bric-a-brac, and one 
suspects he has also deferred to the taste 
of the Chinese compilers of standard an- 
thologies. Tastes in literature, of course, 
alter with each generation, and possibly 
Mr. Waley's versions of Po-Chu-I's po- 
ems will open a fresh, important avenue 
to our understanding of some neglected 
Chinese masters. A thing noticeable in 
Mr. Waley's versions is that they seem to 
abolish the screen of difference between 
our English outlook and that of his Chi- 
nese originals. That in itself is a great 
achievement, and perhaps the secret of 
Mr. Waley's success is partly explained 
by the remark in his foreword, "I have 
not used rhyme because . . . the restric- 
tions of rhyme necessarily injure either 
the vigour of one's language, or the literal- 
ness of one's version." That all the Chi- 
nese poems he selects seem extraordinarily 
human shows that his own taste is guided 
by a sure instinct which repels preciosity 



on the one hand and banality on the other. 
His view, if I do not misinterpret it, is that 
both the early pre-T'ang poetry and Po- 
Chu-I have been neglected and pushed 
out of sight by Chinese scholasticism and 
formalism. Iri his own day Po-Chu-I's 
poems had immense popularity in the Ori- 
ent, and profoundly affected the later 
school of Japanese poetry, but shortly 
after his death that congealing, formaliz- 
ing influence in Chinese thought which Po- 
Chu-I combatted by his realistic example, 
closed in on literature; and the ideal of 
successive generations of poets and schol- 
ars was to repeat, and to imitate, in ste- 
reotyped form classic motifs and models. 
It seems strange that poetry should, like 
the Chinese bandaged foot of later days, 
become cramped and conventionalized by 
fashion for long ages, but we have an 
analogy in the bardic literature of both 
Ireland and Wales, where fresh treatment 
and fresh subjects were frowned upon by 
the professional literary caste for centu- 
ries. According to Mr. Waley, Po-Chu-I 
derided the formal themes and treatment 
of his great predecessors and complained 
of the lack of freshness and lack of draw- 
ing from nature in his contemporaries. 
He seems himself to have been one of 
those strong, innovating forces that ap- 
pear here and there in letters and art, vig- 
orous, creative minds, like Hogarth or 
Whitman, who go their own way regard- 
less of current taste or fashion. His fe- 
cundity must have been very great, since 
he left behind him 4000 poems, which 
have, fortunately, all come down to us. 
In his manner of work he was a true im- 
pressionist, seizing some aspect of life 
before his eyes and absorbing himself in 
recording some incident or reflection or 
feeling of the moment, though he had, 
according to Mr. Waley, a didactic side 
and set great store by those of his poems 
which were written with a purpose. But 



382 



THE DIAL 



[October 25 



we get an excellent view of his sponta- 
neity as a poet, from his own confession: 

There is no one among men that has not a special 

failing 

And my failing consists in writing verses. 
I have broken away from the thousand ties of life, 
But this infirmity still remains behind. 
Each time that I look at a fine landscape, 
Each time that I meet a loved friend, 
I raise my voice and recite a stanza of poetry, 
And am glad as though a god had crossed my path. 

Unfortunately exigencies of space pre- 
vent me from quoting here any of the 
longer specimens which Mr. Waley has 
selected of Po-Chu-I's genius; but a good 
example of his breadth of touch and deli- 
cacy of feeling is "The Old Harp," which, 
simple and direct in style, has true artistic 
subtlety. 

THB OLD HARP 

Of cord and cassia-wood is the harp compounded: 
Within it lie ancient melodies, 
Ancient melodies weak and savourless, 
Not appealing to present men's taste, 
Light and colour are faded from the jade stops: 
Dust has covered the rose-red strings. 
Decay and ruin came to it long ago, 
But the sound that is left is still cold and clear. 
I do not refuse to play it, if you want me to: 
But even if I play people will not listen. 

How did it come to be neglected so? 

Because of the Ch'iang flute and the Ch'in flageolet. 

One perceives that the author of these 
verses was a connoisseur of life as well 
as of the arts, and a ripe product of gen- 
erations of spiritual and aesthetic culture. 
It is much to be hoped that Mr. Waley 
may execute his project of writing Po- 
Chu-I's life; meanwhile he has so ar- 
ranged his "Thirty-Eight Poems" that we 
gain delightful glimpses of the poet's so- 
cial atmosphere. A courtier and high offi- 
cial, Po-Chu-I writes as an experienced 
man of the world, but always with delight- 
ful freshness and vivacity. Thus, in a 
poem to the Hermit Cheng, he feelingly 
chronicles his hardships in attending the 
Emperor's levee on a bitter wintry morn- 
ing, when he had to ride for thirty miles 
in the teeth of the north wind, his horse 
slipping on the causeway, his lantern going 
out, his ears almost blown off, and his 
beard stiff with icicles! When he arrived, 
frozen and stiff, and had to wait for the 
imperial summons within the Triple Hall, 
how he envied Cheng, the retired scholar, 
"who in warm bed-socks dozes beneath 



the rugs and need not get up till the sun 
has mounted the sky." For his extremely 
outspoken criticisms of the Administra- 
tion, it appears that Po-Chu-I fell into dis- 
grace and was exiled to remote provinces, 
where he bewails the fact that it is impos- 
sible for a man of his tastes to make any 
friends with the lusty, ape-like mountain- 
eers of Pa! His uncompromising direct- 
ness is well illustrated in his "Satire against 
Clericalism" (circa A. D. 809), a poem 
which recalls Browning's "Bishop Hatto" : 

The Imperial Patent on the Temple doors is writ- 
ten in letters of gold; 

For nuns' quarters and monks' cells ample space is 
allowed, 

For green moss and bright moonlight plenty of 
room provided; 

In a hovel opposite is a sick man who has hardly 
room to lie down! 

I remember once, when at P'ing-yang they were 
building a great man's house, 

How it swallowed up the housing space of thou- 
sands of ordinary men. 

Like the Chinese in all ages, Po-Chu-I 
detested the warrior's life, and his "Satire 
on Militarism," unfortunately too long to 
quote, preserves an edge that cuts our Eu- 
ropean flesh to-day. He is more indirect, 
however, in his poem on the superstitious 
Emperor Hsien-Tsung (A. D. 806-20), 
who was "devoted to magic," while he 
feelingly commiserates "the man who 
dreamed of Fairies" and who in conse- 
quence was ordered by the monarch to 
watch for the fairy host for thirty years 
in the empty mountains ! "Gods and fair- 
ies," comments Po-Chu-I, "if indeed such 
things there be, their ways are beyond the 
striving of mortal men." This vigorous 
common sense and his breadth of vision 
and delicacy of feeling are the qualities 
that have preserved Po-Chu-I's poetry, 
when classics less human have fallen into 
oblivion. A true realist, Po-Chu-I finds 
his inspiration in everyday life, in little 
scenes and impressions that other natures 
less gifted might deem prosaic. Thus he 
interests us by his half-rueful reflections 
on the fact that the birth of his infant 
daughter, Golden Bells, who "is learning 
to sit and cannot yet talk," has postponed 
for fifteen years, his plan "of retiring and 
going back to the hills." But Golden Bells 
dies when she is three, and the poet tells 
us, in a later poem, how by thought and 



1917]

reason he had driven his grief away, till, 
one day, meeting by chance her foster 
nurse in the road, his sorrow returned. 
Another poem records how when in his 
retirement the officials came by night, 
knocked at his door, and demanded thirty 
bushels of grain tribute, he reflected that 
he himself had occupied four official posts 
and "for doing nothing" had received ten 
years' salary! I wish that I had space to 
quote the delightful poem "After Getting 
Drunk, Becoming Sober in the Night," a 
perfect model of subtle impressionism, but 
in place of this I will cite a piece no less 
charming, "On Going to the Mountains 
with a Little Dancing Girl Aged Fifteen" : 

Two top-knots not yet plaited into one, 

Of thirty years just beyond half 

You who are really a lady of silks and satins 

Are now become my hill-and-stream companion! 

At the spring fountains together we splash and play! 

On the lovely trees together we climb and sport. 

Her cheeks grow rosy as she quickens her sleeve- 
dancing; 

Her brow grows sad as she slows her song's tune. 

Don't go singing the song of the Willow Branches, 

When there's no one here with a heart for you to 
break. 

This poem was written when Po-Chu-I 
was sixty-five, a period of life which he 
celebrates in another, beginning 

I have put behind me Love and Greed; I have done 

with Profit and Fame; 
I am still short of illness and decay and far from 

decrepit age; 
Strength of limb I still possess to seek the rivers 

and hills; 
Still my heart has spirit enough to listen to flutes 

and strings, 

At leisure I open new wine and taste several cups, 
Drunken I recall old poems and sing a whole 

volume. 

But one must make an end of one's quo- 
tations from a poet whose example (which 
has lost nothing of its force and freshness 
in 1100 years) leaves one wondering 
whether many of our contemporary poets 
are not aiming too high? In comparison 
with Po-Chu-I's simple, human, unaffected 
outlook will not many of the moderns who 
dazzle us in Mr. Braithwaite's "Anthol- 
ogy of Magazine Verse," poets "subtle in 
symbolization," poets of "monumental 
moods," poets with "lofty aspirations for 
humanity," appear to future generations 
like damaged locks whose keys have been 
mislaid? Of course as a realist, Po-Chu-I 



does not compete with poetry less concrete 
and familiar, of a higher, more idealistic 
order. But may not our impressionists to- 
day learn from him the lesson that pose, 
self-consciousness, preciosity isolate the 
poet and prevent the development of that 
sense of unity between him and his subject 
which first-rate poetry, of whatever genre, 
communicates ? EDWARD GARNETT. 



The Structure of Lasting Peace 



INTRODUCTORY: PRECEDENT AND ADVENTURE 
IN THE ORGANIZATION OF PEACE 

Never in the history of human warfare, 
which is also the history of civilization, 
have the state and conduct of war met with 
so much organized opposition, and so ef- 
fective repudiation in principle. Wars 
have been fought before, and men have 
before yearned and labored for peace. 
But their hope of its coming and their 
labor have been grounded on their faith 
in supernatural intervention; lasting peace 
could be God-made alone, and only the 
divine miracle could end any but a particu- 
lar war with any but a particular peace: 
the princes of earth are princes of war; 
the heavenly prince is the prince of peace. 
If to-day's war is unique in the strength 
of the forces engaged, the engines em- 
ployed, and the blood and the treasure 
poured out, it is also unique in the wide- 
spread feeling that it is a civil war, in the 
determination that it shall be the last war, 
in the fact that it has been met from the 
outset, in all the states engaged, with or- 
ganized and persistent opposition, which 
may be repressed or martyred, but which 
cannot be destroyed. Call this opposition 
what you will quixotic, stupid, treacher- 
ous, foolish, what not (and at different 
times and in different places it^may merit 
all these eulogia) it remains in the bulk 
a unique record of the spirit in the history 
of the warfare of man upon earth. Pre- 
cedent for it is lacking; it delineates a new 
feature in the aspect of humanity. It 
delineates a new feature because it is secu- 
lar, definitive, and dynamic, while the 
pacifism of tradition has been theological, 
quietistic, and expectant. Modern pacifism 



384 



THE DIAL 



[October 25 



rests its claim upon the ground from which 
militarism has immemorially worked the 
nature and hopes of mankind. It justifies 
its claim by the citation of history and the 
analysis or social structures. 

Peace foundations like that endowed by 
Mr. Carnegie, associations like the League 
to Enforce Peace, differ however from the 
vaguer groups with more adventurous 
social imagination, whose sentimentality is 
not altogether checked by perception, in 
that they try to study procedures and 
seek precedents, and aim to attain no more 
than they can get. They are the realpoliti- 
ker among pacifists, recruited mainly from 
the office-holding, diplomatic, and academic 
classes the precedent-determined, back- 
ward-looking classes ex-presidents, ex- 
secretaries of state, ex-ambassadors, 
professors (ex, therefore, by vocation) 
mostly of international law. Their in- 
fluence is as obstructive to the building of 
lasting peace as that of the sentimental 
groups is irrelevant. 

For the end desired has no prototype 
in the international relations of the past, 
and the situation which teaches so drastic- 
ally how desirable is this end, no duplicate. 
It needs to be faced intelligently, on its 
merits, not habitually via a precedent, nor 
sentimentally through a rootless aspira- 
tion. What is needed to make a peace 
that shall endure is not a development of 
preexisting relationships and conditions; 
these make as easily for war. What is 
needed is a revision of the principle on 
which they rest. The corpus of practices 
and treaties and precedents that goes by 
the euphemism "international law" rests 
in effect upon principles the exact opposite 
of those necessary to constitute a real inter- 
national comity. There is not one of them 
which does not incarnate a precarious 
equilibrium of opposed and inimical inter- 
ests, desires, and forces. War has been 
only the upsetting of such unsteady bal- 
ances, and peace their Sisyphean restora- 
tion. To establish lasting peace there is 
required, therefore, the apprehension and 
stressing of a constitutive principle as im- 
manent in human behavior as that which 
the international lawyer exploits, but mak- 
ing for an interlocking of powers instead 
of a balancing, for an international organi- 



zation whose existence will not repress but 
set free, not frustrate but reen force, the in- 
stinctive spontaneities and normal pur- 
poses of the so various groups of mankind. 
International law has no precedent for 
such a means to such an end, nor can it 
have. What international organization 
existed prior to the war or now exists 
among the embattled alliances, has no 
organs to exercise such a function, nor can 
it have. Unities conditioned upon the 
menace of a common enemy can have 
only an inimical relation to peace, and the 
alliances and combinations of powers have 
derived exclusively from such conditions. 
But there is a more basic reason for the 
futility of precedent. States, natural 
though they be, none the less consist of 
many elements of artifice. The parts of a 
state are very like the parts of a machine. 
Their outstanding trait is rigidity. Often 
they perform excellently what they have 
been ordained to perform, but never any- 
thing more. The maiming or destruction 
of one part cripples the whole; no other 
part is able to take over its functions or 
to perform its services. There is no com- 
pensation, as there is in the organization 
of a living body. Unprecedented situations 
consequently tend to throw governments 
out or gear, to disintegrate them: their 
old organs cannot get adjusted to the new 
conditions; the governments either go to 
pieces, or their bureaus and departments 
go on doing what they have always done, 
and the governments are compelled to 
create new organs adequate to master and 
control the novel situation. As frequently 
as not the creation of new organs of 
government is tantamount to a revolution 
in the structure of the state. The Great 
War offers illustration of all these effects: 
of disintegration and revolution in the his- 
tory of government in Russia ; of industrial 
and political reconstruction in the history 
of government in England; of the begin- 
ning of analogous and far-reaching radi- 
cal changes in the United States, or which 
the visible signs are the creation of the 
Advisory Commission of the Council of 
National Defence, of the office of food 
administration, and of the other offices of 
control. Germany, it is true, has under- 
gone very little change, but precisely be- 



1917] 



THE DIAL

cause war has brought very little news to 
Germany. 

If these phenomena mean anything for 
the right definition of conditions of lasting 
peace, they mean that those are not condi- 
tions subject to the judgment of statesmen 
and diplomats, whose habits of mind and 
body make them inexorably deferent to 
precedent, tradition, and vested interests. 
These phenomena mean that the deciding 
judgment of conditions of lasting peace 
must be made by an enlightened public 
opinion, at the conclusion of the openest 
and freest possible discussion, in deference 
to the simple aspiration of the collectivi- 
ties of mankind for freedom and self- 
expression, and with regard to the actuali- 
ties that favor peace in the system of 
relationships into which regard for prece- 
dent has thrown the hapless rank and file 
of Europe. They pay the cost, theirs 
should be the choice. Considerations 
neither of precedent nor of vested interest, 
nor of prestige nor of honor can grasp the 
principle that must underly the constitution 
of lasting peace, and create the organs of 
an international polity such that the longer 
they function the surer peace will be. 

The alliance of democratic common- 
wealths lays claim to the discovery of this 
principle. With varying stress and much 
confusion of counsel its members are 
unanimous in declaring that they are fight- 
ing this civil war to vindicate it. They 
call it the "Principle of Nationality."

Literary Affairs in London 

(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 
Although it is now only September the autumn 
publishing season has set in with great severity; 
and one does not know whether the odd, dull 
noises one hears from time to time are German 
bombs or only new masterpieces falling heavily 
from the press. Booksellers and circulating 
libraries are getting ready for action, readers are 
looking through announcement lists with ex- 
clamations of pleasure, and reviewers are 
wondering whether the army cannot be persuaded 
to take them after all. The new season promises 
to be thick with important books. Some per- 
sons profess themselves most impatient to see 
Lord Morley's recollections and there is a great 
pother about them in the press. But this is an 
eagerness which, to be frank, I cannot share. 
Lord Morley wrote admirable books on Vol- 
taire, Rousseau, and Diderot. It is possible to 
read these works with a great deal of pleasure, 
though the author sometimes shows a painful 
lack of humor when deprecating the failings of 
his subjects. But when he approaches his own 
time, he develops a singular caution and rigidity. 
His life of Gladstone, though no doubt a faithful, 
and certainly a monumental, record, is rather a 
treatise on a public institution than the story of 
a man. It is a striking contrast to the life of 
Disraeli begun by Mr. Monypenny and now in 
course of completion by Mr. Buckle ; and though 
Gladstone was perhaps not so picturesque as 
"Dizzy," he was no less alive. It seems prob- 
able to me that Lord Morley's reminiscences 
will be equally stilted and inhuman; and the 
noise of their approach, therefore, leaves me with- 
out emotions. 

But there are other books on the point of 
appearing. A new volume of poems by Mr. 
Hardy will give us a fresh opportunity of finding 
out what we really think about the greatest poet 
who ever used such ridiculous language. It is 
true, however, that Mr. Hardy has shown un- 
mistakable signs of growing defter and defter in 
the writing of poetry and possibly his new col- 
lection will indicate what, in a younger man, 
we should call a promising development. Mr. 
Yeats, also, will publish a volume of verse called 
"Per Arnica Silentia Lunae," poems in his latest 
manner, the work, that is to say, of a middle-

aged leprechaun. His skill has grown ever more 
impressive as he has grown older, but his poetry 
has, if anything, increased in eeriness. There is 
something blood-curdling in the triviality of some 
of his pieces, when one considers the perfection 
and mysteriousness of their manner; it is as 
though a banshee should lean across one's shoulder 
and ask, in a conversational tone, for a light. 
You could not have a better contrast to Mr. 
Yeats than Mr. Herbert Trench, who is getting 
into the habit of publishing his collected poems, 
being about to do it this autumn for the second 
time. He gives one the impression that he 
takes himself very earnestly in his writing; there 
is something solid, dignified, even unwieldy about 
his verse. But it is often good and sometimes 
very good, if you can acquire the taste for it. 
And then there are Swinburne's letters but of 
these no more until they appear. It is by no 
means certain, of course, that all or any of the 
books I have mentioned will be out this autumn ; 
for with printers in Yorkshire, binders in Somer- 
set, publishers in London, and railways burdened 
with munitions of war, a great deal may happen 
between announcement and publication. 

Meanwhile one of the great events of the 
season has taken place. The two unfinished 
novels by Henry James are out and have evoked 
a chorus of perplexed applause. No critic dares 
say that he dislikes them, but it is fairly clear 
that not all have understood them. All, or very 
nearly all, are agreed that there is nothing of 
more interest in the two volumes than the notes 
from which the author worked. Mr. Walter de 
la Mare, the very man to write on Henry James, 
is responsible for much the best appreciation of 
the last appearance of the great novelist. The 
trouble which James took to make his meaning 
ultimately accessible, if not immediately apparent, 
the fine gesture with which he renounced false 
lucidity for obscure truth, have fascinated him. 
"What he put into the composition of his novels," 
Mr. de la Mare exclaims, "the ordinary scribbler 
must faint even to speculate upon." And again: 
"There is no happier gift in these Notes, none 
more simple, curious and exhilarating, than the 
spectacle they convey of a man really and truly 
enraptured by the thought and by the effort of 
consummately purposing the thing he can do 
well." "This engrossed self-oblivion," Mr. de 
la Mare proceeds, "is the child's," But it is not 



altogether self-oblivion, nor altogether surpris- 
ing that it should appear childlike. Henry James 
simply sought to render as veraciously as possible 
the thing as it appeared to him. His manner 
reminds one sometimes of the careful, candid 
tortuousness of a child that is trying to explain 
its own motives and make them seem credible to 
an elder. He had a fine temperament, which 
was the essential that made him a good novelist. 
But, as Mr. de la Mare points out, it is his fine 
enthusiasm for his work which is particularly 
revealed in these volumes; and his enthusiasm 
makes him an inspiring example for his fellow- 
craftsmen. When I come to think about it, there 
is a certain similarity between James and Mr. 
de la Mare. Both of them go out to catch a rare 
sensation in a net of words; and frequently the 
words seem to have no bearing on the desired 
goal until, surprisingly, the sensation is caught. 
They have enlarged the bounds of consciousness, 
perhaps, by expressing, however largely and 
vaguely, states of the soul which had previously 
escaped definition. It is, in both cases, patient 
and devoted cunning that does it. 

A minor sensation has been caused by a novel- 
ist of a very different sort. Mr. Alec Waugh, 
son of Mr. Arthur Waugh, publisher and critic, 
left his public school for the army at the age of 
seventeen and thereupon wrote a novel on public- 
school life before passing his eighteenth birthday. 
It is a very remarkable feat; but I find it diffi- 
cult to consider it as anything more than that. 
It has received many eulogistic reviews, but I 
have not detected any note of real enthusiasm 
in the critics. They all seem unable to get past 
the fact that it is remarkable that a boy of seven- 
teen should have written a novel; and it is re- 
markable. But given a boy of intelligence with 
a wide knowledge of recent literature and there 
are plenty of them and with sufficient persistence 
and concentration this is where the number is 
reduced I should have expected just such a 
novel. It is, in a moderate way, a diatribe against 
the code and the standard of values that obtain 
in our public schools; Mr. Arnold Lunn uttered 
that diatribe more convincingly several years 
ago in "The Harrovians." Mr. Waugh's novel 
has wit, humor, and faithful observation. But it 
has also passages of juvenile ineptitude. There 
is one in particular in which the hero breaks out 
of school at night, goes to a fair, and takes a girl

on the roundabouts. The episode is compounded 
of the worst elements in Mr. Masefield and Mr. 
Compton Mackenzie, and leaves me with the im- 
pression that Mr. Waugh still has his wild oats 
to sow. But, though one may refuse to regard the 
book as anything more than an unusual feat in 
the circumstances, it is evident that Mr. Waugh 
has a grasp of the methods of novel-writing that 
may be very useful to him when his character 
ripens. 

I turn to a book that is good in itself. In my 
last letter, I wrote a paragraph or two about the 
poems of Mr. Francis Brett Young, and I men- 
tioned that all these pieces arose out of his ex- 
periences in the East African campaign. He has 
now published a prose narrative of these exper- 
iences, which tells me for the first time that he is 
a doctor and wrestled mightily in the bush with 
wounds and fever. I need make no apology for 
returning so soon to this writer, for his "March- 
ing on Tanga" is a Phoenix of its kind and has 
provoked in me condemnatory reflections on other 
war books. 

These, as it appears to me, are good in so far 
as they are expressive of general emotions occa- 
sioned by the mere existence of war; but those 
books which have described actual experience of 
warfare have run through all the gamut of jour- 
nalism from useless to useful, from inept to ac- 
complished, without achieving anything higher. 
The authors, for whom writing is a vocation and 
the exact rendering of sensations a true passion, 
have been strangely silent. Our war books seem to 
have been typed because they were commissioned, 
not written because experience demanded expres- 
sion. Only Mr. Hugh Walpole has attempted 
a veracious impression with an admixture of 
imagination to make reality seem credible; and 
his "Dark Forest" gives a clearer vision of modern 
warfare than any other novel I have yet seen. 
But Mr. Walpole is not, to me at least, a very 
readable novelist. He gave to a description of 
the Russian front all his talent, untrammelled by 
the thought of a public eager to be told all about 
these things and to reward the teller. But his 
talent simply seems to me insufficient, and the 
"Dark Forest" left me disappointed at the end. 

But Mr. Brett Young in the light of recent 
knowledge I ought to call him Captain Brett 
Young has treated the East African campaign in 
precisely the same spirit as that in which he would 



have treated the material for a novel. He has 
used his sensitive observation and his gift of vivid 
description to make his experiences seem real to 
us and he has avoided calling our attention on 
every third page to the fact that they really hap- 
pened. To the man with the eye of a creative 
artist, a man, that is, who can see the significance 
of life, a battle in the bush is not really much 
more startling than a love affair or a quarrel 
with a friend. Mr. Brett Young has preserved 
this attitude and has written a narrative which is 
at once convincing and moving. War has not 
paralyzed or distorted his literary gifts and these, 
which seemed promising in his two or three 
novels, appear altogether remarkable in the pres- 
ent volume. Let me quote a passage of de- 
scription, taken absolutely at random in these 
pages: 

For two more hours we marched, and then, with a 
sense of the most profound relief, we found that we 
were going downhill once more. Another hour and 
the bush became insensibly thinner. At the end of 
the next a cloudy moon had risen. We were passing 
through a narrow way between grasses as high as a 
man's shoulder, and this change from the alien atmos- 
phere of the bush was subtly reassuring, as though 
we had really stumbled into some pathway cutting a 
moonlit cornfield at home. We halted many times, 
resting our bodies on the stubbly ground, and in one 
of these halts a strange sound came to us, very like 
the silky note of a cornfield waving in the wind; but 
the grasses among which we lay were motionless, and 
no wind stirred. And then it came to me suddenly 
that the sound should have been more welcome, for it 
was that of the Pangani, half deadened by its forest 
curtain. 

That is not one of Mr. Young's high lights; 
it is part of the continuous web of his story and 
it will illustrate, perhaps, the point I wish to 
make. I do not seek to produce the impression 
that, for the seven-hundredth time, the war has 
engendered a New Great Writer. I merely 
point to the fact, which is odd, though it should 
not be, that a writer who was good before the 
war has gone on being good, and has become, 
possibly, even a little better, in the very middle 
of warfare. When the war is done, Mr. Young 
will, I suppose, resume the writing of novels; 
and there are other novelists, though he certainly 
stands high in the younger generation. But, for 
the moment, he stands alone among those who 
have written books about the war.

The Belgian Renaissance 

SOME MODERN BELGIAN WRITERS. By G. Turquet- 
Milnes. (Robert M. McBride It Co.; $1.) 

It was in the year 1880 that a group of young 
men, fresh from the universities of Louvain and 
Ghent, emulous to carry forward the banners 
of their prophets, Baudelaire and Maupassant, 
founded in Brussels the review "La Jeune Bel- 
giquc." 

The influence of Baudelaire was the most 
potent exercised by any individual upon a mod- 
ern literature. These young Belgians had 
steeped themselves in the poisonous exhalations 
of the "Fleurs du Mai." They had all 
experienced the lassitude, the nervous atmos- 
phere, the subtle and powerful decadent perfume 
of his genius. Reading their work, we become 
acutely aware of the danger of exploring the 
dark depths of pathology, abnormalism, and 
mania without the steadying aid of science. It 
is a welcome coincidence, therefore, that during 
the fiftieth anniversary of the death of Baude- 
laire, there appears as well-informed a treatise 
upon this literature as is contained in the present 
book. Its chief virtue lies not so much in the 
consideration bestowed upon individual talent as 
in the synthetic treatment of the movement as 
a whole. It is here that we can listen to the 
beat of the wings of liberty and feel something 
of the unconquerable strength and resiliency of 
I'ame beige. We see these troubled souls vacil- 
lating between gloomy investigation of tenebrous 
wharves and city slums, and conjuring up quaint 
and curious tableaux of ancient imagery, using 
their pens as their ancestors used paint upon 
panel and canvas. 

In 1883 the movement took definite form. 
Quinquennially, the state awarded a prize of 
some thousands of francs for the best book of 
the half-decade. In that year the jury judged 
no book worthy of the prize. Max Waller 
organized in the name of "La Jeune Belgique," 
which felt itself officially insulted, a banquet of 
protest in honor of Camille Lemmonier, who had 
been refused the prize. Following this, he pub- 
lished the "Parnasse de la Jeune Belgique," 
in the compilation of which eighteen poets col- 
laborated, and the battle against the conserva- 
tives was on. Waller, who founded "La Jeune 
Belgique" in 1880 and edited it until his pre- 
mature death in 1889, was a young man of 
vigorous intellect whose style was more facile 
than his critical faculty was keen. He was a 
gifted ironist and a poet of lyrical fantasy. 



Of the earlier, that is to say, the older, 
\\ Tilers of this group, the most distinguished was 
certainly Camille Lemmonier. The critic's de- 
fence of Lemmonier is scarcely necessary to-day. 
No Bernard Lazare will dismiss his sixty 
volumes in five vitriolic pages. He was a painter 
who more than any other Fleming has revealed 
to us in his books the fleshly lusts of his Flanders, 
the gorgeous color of the kermesse, the flaming 
mouth of the furnace, the humble cottage of the 
rustic, its eaves adorned by cooing pigeons. 
Every book is an uninterruped chain of pictures. 

Turquet-Milnes is an enthusiast, and enthus- 
iasm frequently results in loss of perspective. But 
when he upholds Verhaeren against Victor 
Hugo, that supreme windbag whose pomposity 
well-nigh ruined his own genius, I can scarcely 
repress a bravo! The essay on Verhaeren is, 
on the whole, the finest in the book. Displaying 
his early love of color, his depiction of the 
brutality of life, his profound symbolism, the 
author traces in the poetry of Verhaeren the 
unmistakable influence of Baudelaire, and, tak- 
ing him through the period when he wrote some 
of the most beautiful love poems in the French 
language, leaves him singing of science, society, 
and the agents of progress. 

More interesting than any other figures in 
the book are those of Georges Eekhoud and 
Georges Rodenbach. Eekhoud's "La Nouvelle 
Carthage," recently published in an English ver- 
sion, seems to me to be the product of a literary 
Dr. Jekyll. There are flashes of lust, there is 
hoarse and frenetic laughter ; now he is a delicate, 
timorous youngster, curiously in love with his 
haughty cousin, and in another chapter we find 
this child grown into a man who shivers sen- 
sually at the touch of a hooligan. The book is 
a conscious glorification of vice, brutality, and 
ignorance. "Les Kermesses" is a slaughter- 
house. And yet, the man is a poet, akin to Poe 
and not at all to Zola. Rodenbach's master- 
piece is "Bruges la Morte." In this novel he 
depicts Bruges, the home of his childhood, as a 
city of stillness, of mystery; a city where one 
hears black silence creeping all round. Vance 
Thompson once wrote, apropos of Rodenbach, 
"The real Bruges is in the lethargic waters of 
the canals," which is mere rhetoric. Turquet- 
Milnes is nearer the truth when he writes, 
"Close by ... is the market of brass 
glittering in the sunshine, and such lace! and such 
bargaining about lace!" Rodenbach's poetry is 
morbid and mystic. In it, water is always 
stagnant, lights are dim, birds plane, footsteps

are noiseless. An interesting parallel between 
these two is that each has falsified a city; each 
has portrayed the city in his heart, and where 
one has called his Antwerp, the other's is named 
Bruges. 

In a variety of ways, the works of Maeter- 
linck, Van Lerberghe, and Elskamp are inter- 
related. Van Lerberghe conceived the idea of 
making death "ever present, albeit invisible, the 
principle of a new tragedy," and his "Les Flair- 
eurs," the precursor of the Maeterlinckian drama, 
is undeniably the source of the latter. Maeter- 
linck found in Van Lerberghe the trick of intro- 
ducing immaterial, puerile sentences to secure an 
atmosphere of total melancholy. The great 
element that Maeterlinck brought to the stage 
is Silence. His one discovery was our inquisi- 
tiveness, the power of the thing unseen. With 
Van Lerberghe he commenced to develop the 
idea of presentiment, and to heighten his effect, 
to create the proper frame of mind in his audi- 
tor, he added symbolism to his box of tricks 
symbolism which veiled all in mystery and 
which aided him to acquire another element, 
suspense. Add to these his years of study and 
meditation of the mystics, of Plato, Swedenborg, 
Emerson, Boehme, Novalis, and Ruysbroeck, his 
love of nature, and a high stoic beauty, and you 
have the man and his formula. 

Elskamp seems to me to have received too 
much attention from the author, particularly 
since such a poet as Eugene Demolder has none 
whatever. The former is a sweet singer who 
has learned much from the French symbolists 
and from Maeterlinck, and rewritten with a 
great deal of beauty many old Flemish folk 
songs. He employs allegory in the fashion of 
a Fleming, but he suffers somewhat in compari- 
son (the author makes it) with the poet of "De 
1'Angelus de 1'Aube a 1'Angelus du Soir," Fran- 
cis Jammes. Mention of Maeterlinck's "Douze 
Chansons" reminds one that they are now 
Quinze Chansons. 

In an essay entitled "The Destree Brothers," 
the author portrays clearly and logically the 
Catholicism of Walloon Belgium, and against 
the background of its pious spirit he sketches the 
aims and work of leading Gallic men of letters. 
For me, the name of Georges Virres is even more 
interesting than that of Jules Destree, the social- 
ist, or his brother, the Benedictine poet-monk. 
Virres is a novelist who covers the Campine, Eek- 
houd's "Wessex," with a great deal more sanity, 
albeit with some sentimentality, than Eekhoud, 
and he is the author of some delightful and 



refreshing novels. The concluding essay is on 
Leopold Courouble, the accredited humorist of 
Belgium. "La Famille Kaekebroeck" is his 
masterpiece. "La Maison Espagnole" is a faith- 
ful and sincere record of his own childhood. 

Taken all together, this book is one of the 
most conscientious and sympathetic critical sur- 
veys I have read on any literature. Furthermore, 
the author writes in a style that is virile and posi- 
tive, and has a command of his subject that is 
a joy in these days when every school-teacher 
sets up shop as critic. He sees his men in rela- 
tion to their environment, to the earth from 
which they sprang, and having both vision and 
scholarship, he is able to measure them with an 
eye that is unusually clear. If he lays unprece- 
dented emphasis upon the influence of Baudelaire 
in Brussels, it is because such influence becomes 
more patent with every fresh study of Belgian 



literature. 



LEWIS GALANTIERE. 



Denatured Nietzsche 

THE WILL TO FREEDOM. By John Neville Figgis. 
(Charles Scribner's Sons; $1.25.) 

Nietzsche's thought needs interpreters to res- 
cue it from the ignominy which has come upon 
it because of the war. Nothing is more diffi- 
cult to interpret fairly and suggestively. It is 
always a little incongruous to see a great mind 
expounded by a lesser one, and nowhere is the 
incongruity more impressive than in the case of 
Nietzsche. He is too electric, too poetical, too 
subtle in his insight, too coruscating in his incon- 
sistencies, to be tied down and measured out in 
the common expository way. The only way to 
appreciate him is to read him, not read about him. 
And yet to read him is the last thing that the 
Nietzsche-fearer usually does, although there are 
at hand most admirable translations in the charm- 
ing Foulis edition, translations that are usually 
remarkable considering that they are out of a 
language so unconvertible as the German. 

Dr. Figgis's mind is perhaps no more mediocre 
than that of the usual writer who would be 
tempted to interpret Nietzsche, but it is more 
irritating in that it is the mind of a professional 
Christian. His book consists of lectures deliv- 
ered at Lake Forest College, in Illinois, and it 
has the air of an English churchman come across 
the sea to tell the students about Nietzsche what 
was good for them to hear. Dr. Figgis recog- 
nizes in Nietzsche the most dangerous modern 
foe of Christianity, but as an intellectual and an 



390 



THE DIAL 



[October 25 



amateur political philosopher himself, he treats 
him with a certain gingerly respect that at once 
assumes his own competence and slightly patron- 
izes his subject. The result is scarcely happy. 
The discussion is pitched in a key so much lower 
than Nietzsche's own writing, and is conducted 
in such obvious and pedestrian terms that the 
many quotations blaze across the page with a heat 
that seems almost to shrivel the unfortunate com- 
mentator. The systematized Nietzsche whom 
Dr. Figgis so carefully expounds and judges is 
not the Nietzsche who quickens the blood and 
makes the mind race with ideas, the Nietzsche of 
the "Joyful Wisdom" or the "Dawn of Day," 
but a Nietzsche that has been put into a condi- 
tion where he can be taken into Dr. Figgis's 
mind and, presumably, into the minds of the 
students of Lake Forest College. And this con- 
dition is that of a crude philosopher who has 
accepted the Darwinian theory, who sees the 
world as a chaos of warring forces, who rejects 
all moral valuations, and preaches a gospel for 
the few. To Dr. Figgis, Nietzsche is little more 
than a "romantic expression of sheer natural- 
ism." "His doctrine is what it professes to be," 
he says, "a philosophy of force and nothing but 
force; it is certain to stimulate that pride from 
which tyranny comes in its disciples, and it min- 
isters to the worst prejudices of cultivated men, 
that other people are of no account." 

What Dr. Figgis has done here is to make the 
common mistake of confusing a diagnosis with 
an ethics. Nietzsche sees that the raw material 
of life is will-to-power. This is the beginning 
of his diagnosis of society, morality, culture. But 
his doctrine is that this crude striving may be 
transcended, sublimated into harmless and crea- 
tive forms of power. Dr. Figgis omits reference to 
that most significant passage in which Nietzsche 
speaks of the artist, the philosopher, and the 
saint as the highest expressions of the will-to- 
power. The common mind seems unable to keep 
from confounding Nietzsche's analysis of what is 
with his ideal of what ought to be. The Superman 
is a blazing goal, not a tribute to a Borgia or a 
Napoleon. On the other hand, the will-to- 
power is merely an impersonal description of life, 
not a defence of tyranny. So, too, the idea that 
the mass exists for the benefit of superior per- 
sons, is not so much an ideal as a sober analysis 
of the inevitable in a society where all do not 
strive as Nietzsche would have them toward 
harmless and creative expressions of power. The 
Eternal Recurrence has not the ethical signifi- 



cance Dr. Figgis gives it, but is merely a pes- 
simistic intuition of Nietzsche's as to the way 
the world process runs. Even his riddling of 
Christian morality is diagnostic rather than eth- 
ical. 

The truth is that Nietzsche shows the world 
to be a place so much more alarming, exhilara- 
ting, subtle, dynamic than minds of Dr. Figgis's 
calibre can conceive it that when they read the 
analyses of its subtleties and exhilarations they 
can only say, "This is not the world we know; 
therefore it is what you ideally want" ! Nietzsche 
must be taken loosely, imaginatively, not as a 
mathematical problem where his doctrines, his 
effects, his literary charm, and his danger to tim- 
orous Christians, must all be discovered. He 
must be taken as wine or mountain air. Fact 
and ideal must play freely back and forth, con- 
spiring always against the staleness, the mechan- 
icalness, of modern culture and morals and 
theories of knowledge. Dr. Figgis is concerned 
about Nietzsche's "denial of rights to the mass 
of men." "The Putumayo atrocities are in ac- 
cord with his teaching." Away with Nietzsche, 
then, because "an author must be judged by the 
kind of spirit which will naturally come of fol- 
lowing on his lines." This is good fun from a 
professional Christian who would scarcely like 
Christianity to be judged from products like St. 
Simon Stylites and Torquemada, who followed 
all too logically on traditional Christian lines. 

Dr. Figgis defends Christianity as neither 
purely altruistic nor hostile to culture nor even 
ultra-democratic, and chooses as Christian mod- 
els warriors like General Gordon whose force 
would seem to be exactly the incorrigible sur- 
vival of the primitive religion of valor. He 
forgets that Christianity was strongest in the 
eras when it appeared as puritanism or monas- 
ticism. Nietzsche's attack is a fair one, because 
he goes straight at the ideals of these powerful 
eras. A Christianity that is not ascetic or other- 
worldly is not a force in the world. The pagan, 
liberating, audacious message of Nietzsche 
touches the old puritan ideals at the quick. 

Dr. Figgis admits the charm of Nietzsche so 
freely "the literary expression of a soul on fire," 
"power to write with blood" that one wonders 
at his inability to make this the significant em- 
phasis, as it should be in a judgment of any poet- 
philosopher. But it is to the "dangers of 
Nietzsche" that he is most alive. The cult of 
pride, the seductions of immoralism, the unbri- 
dled individualism, the regression to the doctrine 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



391 



of the natural inequality of man, the recrudes- 
cence of pagan morality, all these are held up 
before the frightened reader as scarecrows to 
warn him off. That is why Dr. Figgis's book is 
dangerous if it is taken seriously as an adequate 
discussion of Nietzsche. It must be credited, 
however, with what is perhaps the best short 
sketch of Nietzsche's life to be found in English. 

RANDOLPH BOURNE. 



A World Safe for England 

AFTER-WAR PROBLEMS. By the Earl of Cromer 
and Others. (The Macmillan Co.; $2.50.) 

The last few years have witnessed a rapid dis- 
integration of the laissez-faire theory. Even be- 
fore the war a man who asserted the right to 
conduct his business without respect to public 
interest was generally regarded as a last remnant 
of a once dominant species. Laissez-faire in in- 
dustry has gone the way of the divine right of 
kings. But individualism has persisted in rela- 
tions between nations. The suffering and devas- 
tation of this war have tragically demonstrated 
that the conduct of the least among nations vi- 
tally concerns the health of the rudimentary 
social organization of which it is a member. A 
struggle in which all the resources of one group 
of nations are pitted against those of another has 
emphasized the vital necessity of conserving each 
citizen and each element of wealth. Govern- 
ments have cooperated with one another in so 
intimate a manner and have assumed so many 
functions formerly sacred to the individual that 
to-day the laissez-faire theory is recognized as 
impossible both within the state and as between 
states. This is particularly realized in England. 
There we find the factors which constitute the 
present strength of England pregnant with after- 
the-war difficulties. The unlocking of vast reser- 
voirs of hitherto untouched productive energy, 
the entrance of women into all phases of indus- 
try, the increased home production of food prod- 
ucts, the loyal support of the colonies all these 
demand a reshaping of the domestic organiza- 
tion and an alteration in the political structure of 
the empire itself. Great Britain must build 
anew. But the future is pliable; it invites for- 
mation. A realization that a first essential is 
the formulation of a constructive policy and a 
clear statement of the problems at issue is the 
motive prompting the publication of "After-War 
Problems." 

This book, a compendium of essays by nine- 



teen contributors, is edited by William Harbutt 
Dawson. It discusses the problems of empire 
and citizenship, national efficiency, social reform, 
and national finance and taxation. The articles 
written by Viscount Haldane, Sir Joseph Comp- 
ton-Rickett, Dr. W. Garnett, Professor S. J. 
Chapman, G. H. Roberts, and Professor Alfred 
Marshall, together with those dealing with social 
reform, present a clearly defined programme. 
Back of this are two dominant motives: (1) 
England must regain the markets which neutrals 
and the United States have appropriated or face 
decline; (2) the revelation during the war that 
in the past she utilized a mere fraction of her 
productive capacity suggests a possible acquisition 
of foreign markets much in excess of that of the 
period prior to the war. Germany, of course, 
is a present menace, and Sir Compton-Rickett 
frankly states that it is suicidal to end the war 
with Germany an efficient industrial and com- 
mercial rival. These writers believe the survival 
of England depends entirely upon the conserva- 
tion and development to the utmost of every 
resource at the command of the nation. This 
involves, first, an immediate rehabilitation of the 
educational system. Viscount Haldane outlines 
a national programme of education. It will 
profit Americans as well as Englishmen to read 
this. He believes Great Britain must realize at 
once the value of an industrially trained citi- 
zenry. "Perhaps," he says, "this world crisis, 
with the practical and sharp lessons which it is 
teaching, may awaken us, and convince the 
country that it is on the quality of its workers, 
and on nothing short of that, that it must rely 
if it is to hold its own." This involves the insti- 
tution of continuation schools, trade schools, 
facilities for stimulating and encouraging the ad- 
vancement of capable pupils in the direction of 
their talents, the broadening of the secondary 
schools, and a liberalization of the university 
curricula with special reference to scientific and 
technical training. The state must provide a 
universal education which will begin with pre- 
natal attention to the physical well-being and 
health of the child and extend well into adult 
life. The educational system should serve as a 
dragnet for selecting material best fit in every 
department for the service of England. 

Education is merely a first step. Sir Comp- 
ton-Rickett and Dr. Garnett suggest a policy of 
governmental activity which is an amplification 
of work already being performed. Localities 
must continue to acquire natural monopolies such 
as transportation, gas, water, light, and housing 



392

facilities. It will surprise American readers to 
find the primary reason given is that of avoid- 
ing the lack of efficiency that prevails in non- 
competitive industry. Furthermore, government 
operation will furnish revenues to lighten the 
excessive burden of future taxation. Similarly 
the nation must own national monopolies. Gov- 
ernment supervision is to extend over other lines 
of business as a means of preventing disastrous 
competition, haphazard methods of price fluctu- 
ation, and so on. The policy of creating 
committees and bureaus of research and experi- 
mentation and closely affiliating government de- 
partments with the laboratories of universities 
and technical schools is also to be further devel- 
oped. These will conduct experiments and supply 
information and advice for the benefit of the gov- 
ernment and business firms. Both Dr. Garnett 
and Professor Marshall condemn the institution 
of a protective system either as a source of reve- 
nue or as a means of encouragement to infant 
industry. Infant industries, important to the 
state, should receive direct assistance in their 
youth. This is more useful than a protective 
tariff; "for though the tariff may secure the 
home market against the competition of foreign 
goods produced at lower cost, in order that for- 
eign markets may be open to British goods the 
actual cost of production must be brought down 
to foreign cost, and this reduction is not hastened 
by a protective tariff." Monopolies of mineral 
and other resources of the empire are to be 
granted only to British capital. Government as- 
sistance in the form of advice and supervision 
will extend to the problem of food-production. 
The war has revealed to England her vulner- 
ability and she means to lessen dependence u.pon 
imported food. W. Joynson- Hicks, a member 
of the Tory party, insists that land must be 
divided into small holdings and farmers assisted 
financially through the institution of land banks 
after a manner similar to that adopted for Ire- 
land; while Viscount Haldane emphasizes the 
necessity for agricultural education. 

The labor problem is also discussed in national 
terms. The war has demonstrated the effective- 
ness of scientific management. It has also shown 
that this need not conflict with the continued 
improvement of working conditions. Labor in- 
sists that social legislation initiated previous to 
the war continue in force and be further ex- 
tended. Employment bureaus will multiply. 
Insurance against accident, unemployment, sick- 
ness, and incapacity has come to stay. The guar- 
antee of the government that fair wages shall be 



paid in munition factories and in all industries 
working upon government contracts has "laid 
the foundations of a system which, supplemental 
to the operations of trade-unionism, is capable 
and easy of development till an ample and regu- 
lar income is assured every working-class family 
in the land." G. E. Roberts, who thus speaks 
for labor, suggests the extension of a plan which 
evolved out of the dock strike of 1912. It is to 
legalize throughout a trade or district an agree- 
ment entered into between a substantial body of 
employers and working-people. In industries un- 
organized, as agriculture, direct legislation will 
be necessary to secure a living wage and an 
attractive environment. 

The articles dealing with social reform will 
interest American readers. Social reform is sup- 
plemental to labor legislation. Before the war 
Parliament was embarked upon a constructive 
programme. The war has not dimmed the im- 
portance of this. English social workers confi- 
dently expect the realization of plans far greater 
than those of three years ago. 

But how are these plans to be financed? Will 
the enormous war debt permit it? Professor 
Marshall, the eminent English economist, con- 
tributes an admirable discussion on taxation. He 
believes it is possible to finance these policies by a 
system of taxation so regulated as not to dis- 
courage capital. Income taxes will supercede 
property taxes and the movement to decrease 
both direct and indirect taxes upon the poor will 
continue. His discussion of the relation of im- 
port duties to the raising of revenue, the 
development of foreign trade, and the stimula- 
tion of infant industries and food-production is 
well worth the study of those Americans who 
consider a high protective tariff a necessary con- 
sequence of the war. It is also interesting to 
read his condemnation of preferential tariff ar- 
rangements designed to benefit Great Britain and 
her allies at the expense of the Central Powers. 

This is the constructive policy presented in the 
book. I might have included Mrs. Fawcett's 
excellent article upon "The Position of Women 
in Economic Life." Women have entered every 
line of industrial work but still are underpaid 
and little protected. Mrs. Fawcett attributes this 
to political indifference and trade-union preju- 
dice. She pleads for justice. It is unfortunate 
that the other writers have too little recognized 
women in their vision of a greater England, and 
the indifference of the book to the question of 
suffrage after the war is significant.

I have given prominence to the second and 
third portions of the book. The first part is dis- 
appointing. Lord Cromer, who writes upon 
imperial federation, speaks with the illiberal cau- 
tion of the colonial administrator. He grants, 
theoretically, the demand of the colonies to 
participate in the foreign policy of the empire 
(barring Egypt and India), but he would step 
cautiously in disturbing the existing political 
structure, and he insists that whatever policy is 
adopted, the voice of England must be dominant. 
Bishop Welldon successfully evades discussing the 
profound questions one would expect to see 
treated in a chapter on "The State and the Citi- 
zen." In its stead German barbarism receives at 
his hands a severe drubbing, being painted as the 
logical outgrowth of the subordination of the 
individual to the state; while he criticizes indi- 
vidualism in England upon the ground that 
through the establishment of free schools and 
other forms of social legislation the people have 
become so demoralized that when the war came 
selfish interests drowned the voice of patriotism! 
One infers from his article that opposition to 
the party in power in time of war (something 
perfectly justifiable and worthy in time of peace) 
and any difficulty one may experience in recon- 
ciling individual conscience with public control 
are a manifestation of selfish interests in England 
and of commendable individualism in Germany. 
One would expect such a book to discuss the re- 
lation of the British Empire to a future inter- 
national organization, but it carefully refrains. 
A special article, however, seems necessary on 
"The Cultivation of Patriotism." The alien 
question is handled purely with reference to the 
admission of foreigners to English citizenship. 
Nothing is said regarding the serious problem of 
the movements of British subjects within the 
empire; as, for example, that of the Hindu to 
British Columbia. 

Consequently, while the book presents a con- 
structive national policy for England, it seems 
addressed to Englishmen not vitally interested 
in securing a vision of the needs of the British 
Empire as a whole, or really concerned with in- 
ternational welfare. The spirit is, a world safe 
for England. But one raises the question, if 
each nation at the conclusion of war deliberately 
embarks upon a policy of national efficiency 
prompted solely by the desire to acquire foreign 
markets and to attain self-sufficiency at home, 
what will become of the fruits of the war to end 
wars, and will such a world be safe for anybody?

Jacinto Benavente 

PLAYS BY JACINTO BENAVENTE. Translated by 
John Garrett Underbill. (Charles Scribner's 
Sons; $1.50.) 

Had Mr. Garrett Underbill presented us 
with only two of the four plays that are in this 
volume with "The Bonds of Interest" and 
"La Malquerida" we should have been in- 
clined to accept his high estimate of the dra- 
matic power of Jacinto Benavente. He includes 
with these, however, two plays that are decidedly 
poor in idea and technique "His Widow's 
Husband" and "The Evil Doers of Good." 
These two belong to an inferior dramatic talent. 
Moreover, they have the effect of bringing the 
translator down to his least efficient level. "His 
Widow's Husband" and "The Evil Doers of 
Good" are satirical comedies. They must have 
had lightness and brightness in their dialogue. 
Imagine, then, a passage like this on the first 
page of the play which happens to be first in the 
volume, "His Widow's Husband": 

Everybody accepts and respects your decisions. 

Not invariably, I am sorry to say especially now 
that I have taken up the suppression of the hips, 
which are fatal to the success of any toilette. Society 
was formerly very select in this City, but it is no 
longer the same, as you no doubt have occasion to 
know. Too many fortunes have been improvised, too 
many aristocratic families have descended in the scale. 
There has been a great change in society. The par- 
venus dominate and money is so insolent! People 
who have it imagine that other things can be impro- 
vised as education, for example, manners, good taste. 
Surely you must realize that such things cannot be 
improvised. Distinction is a hot-house plant. We 
grow too few gardenias nowadays like you, my 
friend. On the other hand, we have abundance of 
sow-thistles. 

It would be hard to make dramatic dialogue 
more prosaic than this. 

But the plays that are intrinsically good have 
more liveliness in translation. It is these two 
"La Malquerida" and "The Bonds of Inter- 
est" that make us feel that Jacinto Benavente 
has dramatic talent. He is not at all in the 
class with Strindberg or Tchekhov, for he has 
made no discovery either in psychology or tech- 
nique. But he is in the class with his compatriot 
Jose Echegaray. He has dramatic invention, 
power of characterization, and he has, too, the 
ability to impress a certain atmosphere on read- 
ers and spectators. 

"La Malquerida" is melodrama, but melo- 
drama that has distinction by reason of a strange 
reserve that goes through it all. This reserve 
is such that although two people have been mur- 
dered when the play closes and two others are 
likely to have their lives ended, we have all the

time the impression of smothered fire. The plot 
might be that of one of the ungovernable plays 
that the Sicilian Players produce. A stepfather 
(Estaban) is passionately in love with a girl 
(Acacia) who is his wife's (Raimunda's) daugh- 
ter. She loves him, though to her the passion 
appears as hatred. Estaban has had one of the 
girl's suitors frightened off and he has the other 
murdered. In a Sicilian version of such a plot 
fury would out-top fury. But in this play there 
is so much restraint in the writing, so much 
reserve in the characters, that we get the impres- 
sion of quietism rather than of fury. We are 
made to feel the gravity and the dignity of the 
Spanish character all through the play. 

"La Malquerida" is a play that might make 
a success on the American stage, if put on by one 
of our few adventurous producers. The parts 
for the women Raimunda and Acacia have 
splendid scope. The exposition is needlessly long 
and is complicated by unnecessary characters, but 
it could be very easily shortened and simplified. 

"The Bonds of Interest" is a play in which 
the action is so generalized that the performers 
have the anonymity of puppets. We can imag- 
ine the players who take the parts of Crispin, 
Leander, Columbine, Polichinelle, Harlequin, 
Pantaloon, and other characters as simplified, 
wearing masks. Crispin, Leander's servant, starts 
things going by his rogueries. He creates for 
his master "the bonds of interest." These, 
being created, make it inexpedient that Leander 
be discredited as an impostor. The innkeeper 
whom he owes for entertainment, the poet whom 
he has patronized, the duenna whose expectations 
have been encouraged, the mother whose daugh- 
ter has been compromised, all find it necessary 
to push him towards the marriage that makes 
his fortune. But "The Bonds of Interest" is 
not a comedy of rogueries: everything is made 
abstract so that we come to see a philosophic 
idea in the play the dependence of that which 
loves and idealizes upon that which contrives and 
gains. 

The translator by rigidly following a custom 
of the author puts, we think, a needless strain 
upon the readers of the English version. Bena- 
vente tells nothing about his characters on the 
front page or in the programme; he merely 
enumerates them Raimunda, Acacia, Juliana, 
Dona Isabel, and so on. He gives us no advance 
information as to their age or their relation to 
one another. In the English version this lack 
often makes us miss the significance of a page or 



so of dialogue. Reading "La Malquerida," for 
instance, we easily place Juliana as a servant. 
But we imagine that she is a maid. The fact 
that she is old or middle-aged and a family re- 
tainer gives a significance to her appearance that 
we miss on a first reading. Moreover, she is 
married to Rubio, the man-servant, who is Esta- 
ban's creature. Had we this information in ad- 
vance, her hints would have more suggestion 
for the reader. 

PADRAIC COLUM. 



An Asiatic Frontier 



FROM THE PERSIAN GULF TO ARARAT. By G. E. 
Hubbard. (E. P. Dutton Sc Co.; $3.50.) 

There was a time before the war when we 
were extracting the last ounce of romance from 
the fact that our twentieth century had found 
no more frontiers to delimit, no more hinterlands 
to protect, no more savage races to whom the 
gramaphone and the sewing machine were sym- 
bols of western progress. Indeed, the barbed 
wire of the last outpost had been taken down 
and was rusting about the fields of black, brown, 
and yellow races on the jungle side of Asia and 
Africa. So outworn had the subject become in 
the hands of editorial writer and diplomatic vale- 
tudinarian that the stage was busy substituting 
for the thrills of high finance and big business 
the thrills of a plot based upon the haul politique 
of canals and frontiers. And now, once more 
the price of barbed wire is significant, and, 
whether or not the status quo is to be restored, 
this is not the last volume on delimitation we are 
to read, nor will our old age be unvexed by the 
intimate confidences of soldiers and diplomats. 

But, in pre-war literature, Mr. Hubbard's 
book deals with the "last frontier" in Asia: 
indeed, it is the story of a frontier controversy 
that has lasted between the Turkish and Persian 
governments since 1842. Fortunately it is not 
devoted to that tiresome record, nor even to the 
dreary business that is concerned with erecting 
posts and deciding upon natural or artificial bar- 
riers between the litigants. The author has inci- 
dentally furnished us with a careful description 
of those regions in Mesopotamia and Persia that 
have been fought over by the British, Russian, 
Turkish, and German armies. A good idea of 
the almost insuperable task faced by the British 
in their advance to Bagdad may be gleaned along 
with attractive glimpses of the country in its

rarer and kindlier moods and aspects. Fauna 
and flora, and the pastoral life of the fierce 
Kurds, together with the picturesque life and 
customs of the various nomad tribes the British 
commission encountered, form the material of 
Mr. Hubbard's leisurely pen. Though he was 
captivated, as other writers have been, by the 
charm of the Kurd, it was nevertheless a Kurd- 
ish bullet which imposed the long convalescence 
that enabled him to collect his impressions. Not 
long after the British, Russian, Turkish, and 
Persian commissions had placed their final mark 
on the frontier line, these Kurds were loosed 
against the defenceless Christians (Nestorians) 
of the country, and began that systematic butch- 
ery which has extended through Armenia down 
to Mount Lebanon. 

Delimiters of Asiatic boundaries seem to agree 
with commercial travellers on the dislike, re- 
marked by Lord Curzon in his essay on frontiers, 
shown by Orientals of the Near East for giving 
and observing a contract. This, however, is not 
to be marvelled at among races that have been, 
and still are, subject to the Turk. The only 
reason Turkey consented to a boundary com- 
mission was the fact that British and Russian 
influences were converging in Persia. The great 
trouble and expense of previous commissions that 
had come to naught might have been increased 
in the present case had not a copy of the carte 
identique, the map completed in 1869 and ap- 
proved as a basis for negotiation, come to light 
in a British consulate in Persia the Ottoman 
copy had been destroyed by the last sultan. Thus 
the joint commission experienced all the various 
types of frontier problems. They had recourse 
to geographical, racial, linguistic, religious, and 
purely artificial devices, and one regrets that the 
author retails none of the solutions finally ac- 
cepted. Apparently the Turks were in a hurry, 
and for once failed to create the classical diffi- 
culties they had offered to previous commissions. 
Among the nomad tribes, when graybeards were 
consulted as to local custom and date, they inva- 
riably replied that the land, so far as they remem- 
bered, had belonged to Allah. 

The charm of Mr. Hubbard's book lies in his 
picture of the interesting variance in customs as 
the picturesque tribes and races were encountered 
along the great mountain range that determined 
the course of the frontier. In the south, Iranian 
is separated from Semitic stock, that is, Lur from 
Arab. In the north, the tribal Kurds are divided 
into the two great sects of Islam Sunni and 



Shiah. Since Persia is the home of the latter 
sect, it was allotted to her care, while the Sunni 
Kurds went to Turkey. Throughout the jour- 
ney the musical Persian was found alongside the 
guttural Arabic. The humors of the expedition 
are not forgotten in the discomforts. Water was 
always an important question, and once the 
British camp was pitched beside a delectable 
stream, the campers finding, shortly after, that its 
chief property was a strong solution of epsom salts. 
Fleas were ubiquitous, and the author records 
that the Kurds are compelled to rid themselves 
periodically of this pest by abandoning their 
camps, bag and baggage, and taking refuge in 
the mountains; frequently the British camp was 
pitched disastrously close to an old Kurdish site. 
The Kurd has a gift for phrase : a difficult moun- 
tain was known as the "Tearer of Pants," and 
its neighboring height as the "Breaker of Nails"; 
snipe is known as the "Father of Noses," and 
a portly British official was addressed ceremo- 
niously as the "Father of Bellies." A Kurd chief 
was asked his income by a British officer and 
promptly named the sum. He was then asked 
his perquisites. "Oh," said the chief, "I never 
steal." Whereupon the Briton countered: 
"Well, then, you're not much of a Kurd." But 
the laugh was not always on the native. Some 
nomad Lurs, whose staple food is wild honey, 
were told that in England the bees were domes- 
ticated and lived in hives. But they were too 
wise for such a traveller's tale. "Ho, ho," said 
one, "and I suppose when you go up to your 
summer pastures you drive them in front of you 
like sheep!" The intimate glimpses of the 
country and its varied ethnology are certainly 
more interesting than the perpetual bickering 
over such matters as grazing-rights and water- 
privileges that must have been a diurnal pro- 
gramme. And if Mr. Hubbard's book is more 
concerned with the human and natural scene 
than with the petty affairs of international jeal- 
ousies in this last frontier of our world before 
Armageddon, the fact remains that it is still 
politically intriguing, and must continue to be 
after the war. A rich region that has for so long 
lain desolate under the blighting power of the 
Turk may yet fulfil a greater political and eco- 
nomic destiny under a more benign suzerain, 
when East and West once more begin delimiting 
frontiers, invoking nature, science, and artifice 
for the possession of the many acres that the war 
will leave out there basking in the sun.

A Parnassian 'Romance 

THE KING or ALSANDER. By James Elroy 
Flecker. (London: Max Goschen, Ltd.) 

It is, as far as one hears, the only novel of 
James Elroy Flecker, and you come upon it not 
by patient searching nor by impetuous calls on 
the publisher, but by happy accident a sale of 
"seconds" and rejected noveb at Mudie's or the 
Times Book Club. For the very existence of this 
happy book seems forgotten, even now when every 
last word of Flecker's is so cherished. "The King 
of Alsander" is hardly a last word in Flecker's 
tragically brief life; the preface is dated "Bey- 
routh, Syria, 1913," but for those who have made 
not a fad but a companion of his "Golden Jour- 
ney" and have sworn with him "that Beauty lives 
though lilies die" it is sufficiently precious. 

"Here is a tale all romance," he exclaims, " a 
tale such as only a Poet can write for you, O 
appreciative and generous Public a tale of mad- 
men, kings, scholars, grocers, consuls, and Jews: 
a tale with two heroines, both of an extreme and 
indescribable beauty: a tale of the South and of 
sunshine, wherein will be found disguises, myster- 
ies, conspiracies, fights, at least one good whip- 
ping, and plenty of blood and love and absurdity : 
a very old sort of tale : a tale as joyously improb- 
able as life itself." 

If you will, it is a tale of the Prisoner of 
Zenda written by a poet who is an artist and has 
a sense of the ridiculous so keen and pervasive 
that it begins by spoiling a story and ends by- 
being a story in itself. Even in this inconsequent 
dream of an idle Syrian day Flecker was too 
good an artist to neglect his form, too seriously 
a Parnassian even in his frivolity to forget his 
technique. Indeed it is quite possible to consider 
this book a Parnassian protest against the extrava- 
gance and sentimentality of the modern romantic 
novel, just as the "Parnasse" itself was a pro- 
test against the same characteristics of French 
romantic poetry. Only that would be missing 
the fun. 

"The King of Alsander" begins in the little 
English village of Blaindon, "in some romantic 
English spot, Where summer's not so very hot, 
And winter not too chill." Thither, directly to 
the bongmash (which is Blaindon for Bon 
Marche!), where Norman Price keeps shop when 
he is not reading Apuleius, comes an old man, a 
poet, instilling into young Norman the desire 



for travel and giving him a word of advice, to 
go straight to Alsander. So Norman goes there 
and is met, as all young, fair, tall Englishmen 
should be met, by Peronella, whose countenance 
"was a sweet rose and jasmine garden but 
always, I would have you remember, a garden 
that blossoms by the sea, with vistas of the bay- 
down every alley of the roses, and gleams of blue 
water glinting behind the trellis of the jasmine, 
and the sea air slightly touching the colour of 
all the flowers." 

Before he can fall properly in love with Pero- 
nella, Norman is caught in what is technically 
known as "a web of intrigue." Alsander has 
fallen on evil days and the last of the Kradendas, 
the ruling family, is an idiot. The arrogant and 
bigoted Count Vorza rules in his stead, and only 
a few patriots remain, who dream of an Alsander 
as great as Florence in her elder day. The Asso- 
ciation for the Advancement of Alsander chooses 
Norman to represent the king, for the king him- 
self has not been seen by mortal eyes these many 
years. Norman is promptly examined for the 
post, rebels at the physical examination, is whip- 
ped, goes to the British consul, and demands that 
the Navy "what are they wasting coal in the 
North sea for" if they can't protect an English- 
man from being insulted? come to his rescue. 
But Arnolfo, the pale and mystic figure of the 
story, persuades him to accept the position of king 
and he is duly crowned. A counter rebellion 
breaks out, because the new king has foresworn 
his early love for Peronella when he discovers that 
his good angel Arnolfo is, in reality, the Princess 
lanthe, legitimate heir to the throne after the 
madman. And so after much bloodshed and a 
dashing fight, in which the idiot king is killed, 
Norman marries the princess and becomes the 
true ruler of Alsander. 

Whereon the ancient poet reappears at Blain- 
don, calls down the fairies who knew Norman's 
mother, and takes Norman's friend to assist at 
his own disappearance in the tumultuous seas! 

I take it that this is a fair plot, to which the 
intelligent reader of the summary can add details : 
the scene in the old shop where Norman is made 
captive ; the scene in the castle where the imbecile 
king knights Norman as his deliverer; the quiet 
moment at the height of the coronation revels 
when Norman, torn by his passion for Peronella, 
\ irlds in his own despite to the low voice of Ar-

nolfo and discovers the princess; the ancestral 
glories of Alsander; the Jewish doctor who isn't 
a bad fellow after all ; the riot and the rout. A 
well-printed and easily read book of some 300 
pages demands no more. 

But what makes "The King of Alsander" a 
joyous book, and a perplexity to those who like 
their Anthony Hope straight, is the bubbling and 
irrepressible humor of the telling. The maddest 
of all modern romances, "The Man Who Was 
Thursday," alone contains more wildness and 
more joy than this book. Thus the introduction 
to Alsander: 

Who is there (I should have written in 1820) or 
what man of feeling and imagination can be found, 
who, on contemplating the ineffable grandeur and 
unspeakable majesty of Nature, does not ardently 
aspire to hold at the same moment communion with 
some divinely tender female heart, to read in those 
liquid eyes his own reflections purged of their dross 
and transmuted into gold, to press those sensitive 
fingers and thereby lose himself in rapture among 
the gorgeous scenes that astonish and confound his 
gaze, to seal those fluttering lips with the memory 
of an unforgettable moment? 

To resume the use of the English language, Nor- 
man felt lonely. 

Or, Peronella: 

I will not give my heroine "plain but interesting 
features" or "a noble rather than beautiful counte- 
nance with intellect shining in her eyes," or even in 
a candid moment declare her to possess "a haunting 
plainness all her own." But apart from all this 
there is the truth to consider, and this young girl was 
assuredly one of the most perfect women God ever 
made by accident or Satan by design. 

The trick is by no means a new one, the play 
of ironic intelligence on a romantic subject is, we 
are asked to believe, the essence of modernism. 
But Mr. Flecker's achievement is extraordinary 
in that it leaves and even enhances the romance^ 
Because this is a good tale and a thriller. 

His embellishments: "Grave matters of ethics 
are frequently discussed in the course of my 
story." One of them is the connection between 
whipping and philosophy; another, quite a good 
one, is concerned with English hypocrisy and 
English cleanness in the matter of sex. "For 
Thackeray, the Irregular Unionist (if so we may 
style those easy livers), is a scourge of high 
society; for Dickens, he is an ungodly scoundrel, 
a scourge of low society; for Thomas Hardy, he 
is a noble fellow disregarding the shackles of 
convention; while the late George Meredith in- 
variably punishes the amorous by describing them 
as intellectual failures. Today Mr. Shaw would 
consider Lovelace disreputable owing to his lack 



of interest in social problems, while the pale 
Nietzscheans would worship him in ecstatic gasps 
as a monstrous fine blond beast." There is more 
of this and more of many things, sly jests and 
sharp remarks, pointed asides throughout the 
story, and ineffable good humor. 

It is wrong to write seriously about a book 
of this type; the only excuse is that one cannot 
write as Flecker did, and to write seriously may 
persuade some people to read frivolously. Yet if 
we are thinking of romance and such things, and 
if we are wondering a little at these strange Eng- 
lish whose grocer boys become poets if not kings, 
who are endlessly provincial, and who colonize 
the world, we may reflect on Flecker and on this 
book of his. Because it is intensely English. It 
revels in the South and sunshine because it has 
its roots in 

November Evenings! Damp and still 
They used to cloak Leckhampton Hill, 
And lie down close on the grey plain 
And dim the dripping window pane. 

He married a Greek lady; he lived for the 
Grecian islands and the Moslem East, but he 
never forgot the England which slopes down 
the green and lovely Cotswolds or runs to the sea 
in the bright sands of Bournemouth. The mys- 
teries of the East and the urgings of adventure 
have been expressed to us best by inland and pro- 
vincial folk, by a Conrad or a Louys or a Flecker. 

But when I walk in Athens town 

That swims in dust and sun 
Perverse, I think of London then 

Where God's brave work is done, 
And with what sweep at Westminster 

The rayless waters run. 

It is this firm rooting in London and the Glou- 
cester lanes which makes his feeling for Iskander 
and Samarkand so authentic in his verse, and it is 
his feeling for God's brave work which makes 
the flightiness and cheer of Alsander so delightful. 
"Oh shall I never never be home again!" he 
cried. "Meadows of England shining in the rain, 
Spread wide your daisied lawns." He would be 
the last to say that it was in this tale all of 
romance that he came home. It was a home of 
sobriety and decency, a home cultivated and 
blessed by the very passage of the tender years, 
and his romance and his poems are not of these 
things. But he would have known that only the 
things he longed for and desired made it possible 
for him to give such desirable things to the world.

PLAYS BY OSTROVSKY. Edited by George 

Rapall Noyes. Scribner; $1.50. 

It takes what amounts almost to genius to 
make a good translation. Perhaps that is why 
so few of the many books rendered into English 
are readable. There are, after all, not many 
men with scholarship enough to think in two 
languages and at the same time imagination 
enough to recognize the soul of a phrase and 
give it rebirth in a new tongue. Ostrovsky, the 
dramatist contemporary of Tolstoy and Dos- 
toevsky and Turgenev, presents a difficult prob- 
lem for the translator. Perhaps that is why the 
English versions of his plays have been so few. 
His characters, for the most part from the Rus- 
sian merchant class of fifty or sixty years ago, 
speak in a racy vernacular of their own. Trans- 
lation of the idiom is impossible. To paraphrase 
Moscow slang with Chicagoesc is, of course, out 
of the question. The translator in the present 
instance has attempted the betwixt and between 
of colloquial English, and the result is cumber- 
some. Still there is enough of interest in the 
four plays to make up for the lumbering dialogue. 

The plays made their first appearance in the 
fifties and sixties, just a few decades before "An 
Old Homestead" initiated the first "school" of 
American drama, and yet they are surprisingly 
modern, not only in their merciless realism, but 
even to a certain extent in form. They are not 
patterned after that formula of "big scenes" and 
"curtains" against which we are only beginning 
to revolt. They meander as life meanders, full 
of irrelevant speeches, and at the end they are 
likely to offer no resolution, as in "A Protegee 
of the Mistress," or to peter out in inconsequen- 
tial dialogue, as "It's a Family Affair We'll 
Settle it Ourselves." Yet they have dra- 
matic quality. In spite of an Elizabethan ten- 
dency toward unnecessary soliloquies, allegorical 
names for very real characters, and speeches 
hurled robustly over the footlights at the audi- 
ence, Ostrovsky's plays are, in the main, the sort 
of plays one would like to see on the American 
stage. To expect such plays is not demanding 
too much of our playwrights, for Ostrovsky is 
not a genius. He is simply the scribe of a chang- 
ing time, noting with some faithfulness its effect 
upon a portion of society. And yet, as histories 
of Russian manners during the years immediately 
preceding and following the emancipation of the 
serfs, and as masterpieces of characterization, 
these plays have much to give the American stu- 
dent of the drama, even through the medium of 
an inadequate translation. 



THE RAILROAD PROBLEM. By Edward Hun- 

gerford. McClurg; $1.50. 

Like the poor, the railroad problem is always 
with us. In a volume of two hundred and fifty 
pages Mr. Hungerford has told us something of 
the ills of "the sick man of American business" 
and has suggested a few palliatives some may 
think them curatives. The book is based on 
articles which appeared in such journals as "Col- 
lier's," "Every Week," and the "Saturday Even- 
ing Post." From this one would naturally 
expect it to be written in an easy and entertaining 
style, and in this he will not be disappointed. 
In fact, it is just such a volume as one would 
like to read on a railroad journey. Four chap- 
ters deal with labor, two with organized and 
two with unorganized, and they are full of inci- 
dents in the everyday life of engineers, conduc- 
tors, and telegraphers, that have a real bearing 
on the railroad problem. The same may be said 
of the chapters dealing with the railroads and 
their competitors, and the relation of the rail- 
roads to national defence is stated in a clear and 
concise way. The good red blood of human life 
runs all through the book. Even the serious stu- 
dent of the railroad problem may profit by its 
perusal, for it helps to humanize the whole situ- 
ation. 

BIRDS OF BRITAIN Their Distribution and 
Habits. By A. H. Evans. Putnam's; $1.25. 
The American nature-loving public is accus- 
tomed to two types of books about birds first, 
the guidebook which tells how to identify them, 
and second, the popular descriptive stories of 
bird-life. This British book falls in neither 
class. It is a hybrid. Written primarily for use 
in schools, it fails to meet the American concep- 
tion of natural-history education because it deals 
so plentifully in scientific phrase and classifica- 
tion. It is not helpful as a guidebook because it 
makes no pretense of trying to aid in identifying 
birds, except incidentally through the many 
photographs which accompany the text. All the 
birds which visit Great Britain are described un- 
der their respective families. It is the family, 
however, not the species, which is made the centre 
of descriptive interest. The popular study of 
birds in Great Britain is far behind nature study 
in the United States. This book is just one 
evidence of the lack of adequate facilities for 
bringing bird-life close to the school and the 
home. There are excellent guidebooks to British 
and European birds, though there are still lack- 
ing those popular, intimate, highly illustrated 
nature-books which bring the boy and girl of 
the average suburban and country home in Amer- 
ica so close to wild life. This book, intended 
for children, does not meet such a need.

A SCALE OF PERFORMANCE TESTS. By 

Rudolf Pintner and Donald G. Paterson. 

Appleton; $2. 

Mental testing promises to become so tech- 
nical a pursuit that manuals of the art are in- 
dispensable. Mental tests aim to measure 
capacity by the double method of finding what 
a child (or, for that matter, an adult) knows 
and what he can do. Knowledge is more or less 
incidental, even accidental; though the immunity 
from its acquisition in a constantly inviting and 
stimulating environment argues incapacity. But 
doing seems to stand nearer to ability. On the 
basis of this conception Professors Pintner and 
Paterson have developed a graded series of tests 
based entirely on performance, though necessar- 
ily using the material of identification, recogni- 
tion, and perception of logical relations, which 
enters as readily into doing as into knowing. 
Such tests must be tried out and a standard of 
performance for each age determined. The 
standard then becomes an available yardstick to 
determine mental stature, particularly with ref- 
erence to notable defect or proficiency. The 
programme is admirably carried through, with 
abundance of well-arranged tables and sufficient 
interpretation to show the bearing of the results 
and warn against sources of error. There are 
so many types of children to be tested for whom 
the medium of language is not suitable the deaf, 
the speech-defective, the foreign, and even the 
nervous that performance-tests have a peculiar 
significance. In view of the fact that the pres- 
ent war is to see tried on an unprecedented scale 
the method of testing recruits to gauge their 
rank, in comparison with other forms of exam- 
ination and estimate, psychology is to find an 
unusual practical application, by which the value 
of the art is likely to be demonstrated. Equally 
has its application to the disqualified in mental 
and moral make-up, against whom society must 
protect itself, made the subject of great moment. 

STUDIES IN INSECT LIFE. By Arthur 
Everett Shipley. T. Fisher Unwin; 10s.6d. 
Professor Shipley has collected in this volume 
a number of previously published articles and 
addresses. They are all so written as to be 
intelligible to the lay reader and they are of 
more than passing interest. In one of the studies, 
"Insects in War," there is presented an aspect 
of the problem of army life that is not likely to 
have occurred to the average man. Three essays 
are given to bees and wasps and two to the 
development of oceanography. Among the lat- 
ter there is an interesting study of Sir John 
Murray, the founder of that science, with some 
sidelights on university life in Edinburgh in the 
late sixties. Modern chemists will be amused to 



read of how Robert Louis Stevenson, not being 
very much interested in chemistry, would "mani- 
fest the greatest adroitness in drawing Robertson 
Smith, who was then teaching chemistry, from 
the arid deserts of physical science into the 
tangled thickets of theological discussion, and he 
always succeeded in keeping him there as long 
as he liked." The essay most likely to appeal to 
the lay reader is the one on "Hate." Basing his 
conclusions on the work done by Cannon as to 
the function of the adrenal glands, Professor 
Shipley thinks that the function of hate is, phy- 
siologically, simply that of placing men in a 
position to put forth their utmost physical ef- 
fort. There are two articles of interest to the 
literary historian: "Zoology in the Time of 
Shakespeare" and "The Revival of Science in 
the Seventeenth Century." 

ITALY AT WAR. By Herbert Vivian. 
Dutton ; $2.50. 

This is a different sort of book from Mr. 
Alexander Powell's volume of the same name 
and approximately the same date of publication. 
Mr. Vivian writes as an observant rambler who 
chanced to be footing it through Italy at the time 
Prince von Billow was given to understand that 
his presence in Rome was no longer desired. 
Thus the Italian people's attitude to the great 
issue of the day is presented with the insight and 
the accuracy of one familiar with the ways of the 
common folk and speaking their language (as 
also several other European tongues). Note- 
worthy is the author's emphasis upon the 
too little suspected perpetration of Austrian 
atrocities. Frightfulness he shows to be not 
exclusively a Prussian product. Such books as 
Mr. Vivian's and Mr. Powell's are especially 
welcome, even especially needed, at this time to 
set forth the extraordinary skill and heroism with 
which Italy is quietly carrying through an ar- 
duously (and literally) up-hill task. Might not 
a little more power at her elbow, just now, enable 
her to end the war for us by pushing on to Lai- 
bach and Vienna and thence into Germany, if 
not actually to Berlin? 

THE STREET OF INK. By H. Simonis. 

Funk & Wagnalls; $3. 

Though not all that its subtitle claims for it, 
this anecdotal retrospect down the length of 
Fleet Street is a remarkably interesting and in- 
forming book, being from the pen of a shrewd 
observer with a retentive memory who for twen- 
ty-two years has been an active journalist in the 
famous "street of ink" that gives its name to the 
volume. Mr. Simonis is at present director of 
the London "Daily News" and "Star," and his 
fund of personal reminiscence goes far toward 
justifying the publishers' assertion that he has met

practically everyone worth knowing in London 
journalism during the period covered by his ram- 
bling narrative. An intimate history of recent 
English journalism the book may well call itself, 
but outside of England we have only a single 
chapter on "The American and French Press." 
The writer's fondness for illustrative anecdote 
contributes no little to the entertaining quality of 
his pages, though occasionally the application of 
the story to the subject it is intended to illus- 
trate is not so obvious as it might be ; but a timely 
word pointing out this application now and then 
helps us out of the difficulty. 

OUTPOSTS OF THE FLEET. Stories of the 
Merchant Service in War and Peace. By 
Edward Noble. Houghton Mifflin; 60 cts. 
That heroes of the merchant marine should, as 
a rule, receive but scant recognition seems very 
unjust to Mr. Edward Noble, and his present 
collection of stories will possibly do something 
toward causing the creation of an order or simi- 
lar honor to be bestowed on them. To the ordi- 
nary perils of the deep are now added the risks 
and the terrors of war, as is vividly brought out 
in such tales as "Torpedoed" and "Homeward 
with Grain," which, with seven other short 
pieces, make up the contents of the book. Most, 
if not all, of these sea-yarns have already seen 
the light in various British journals, but are 
none the worse for that. At least they are new 
to American readers. They speak eloquently of 
the tragedy of the good ship done to death, with 
passengers and crew, by the furtive submarine. 

WAR. By Pierre Loti. Lippincott; $1.25. 

In the perusal of this new volume by Loti, 
it is brought home to one again how inexplicably 
and beautifully his manner and matter are fused. 
He treats of the usual subjects two Belgian 
child refugees, the soldiers, the ruined cathedrals, 
the battle line but in the atmosphere of this 
book, one sees everything bathed and refreshed. 
The sketch of the refugees touched us more than 
anything we have read regarding the war, yet it 
is by no means harrowing, but is colored with a 
whimsical humor. He happily awakens in the 
reader his amused, hopeful pity for the children. 
In all the sketches of personages, he characteris- 
tically avoids the obvious and the crudely emo- 
tional. Even in the story of his visits to the 
King and Queen of Belgium, where his self- 
consciousness is most apparent and where his 
d'Artagnan-like adoration might render him 
ridiculous, there is perfect artistic restraint. As 
for the horrors of war, they are shown without 
squeamishness but with no wallowing in awful- 
ness. 



Others have written of the ruins of Ypres and 
Rheims, but it remained for Loti to tell us of 
their melancholy beauty. He shows them as they 
look in the twilight ; he calls up the spirit that 
was intrinsically theirs, and finds the inner mean- 
ing of their desecration in the desire on the part 
of the Prussians to destroy the very heart of 
ancient France. He throws an exquisite glamour 
around Ypres, portraying the cathedral and the 
great belfry projecting their silhouettes against 
the sky, seemingly congealed, gesturing with 
broken arms; and he conjures up the mournful 
surroundings in which Ypres is now lost. Then, 
Loti-like, he shows us three or four little girls 
escaped from the cellars which sheltered them 
and dancing around in the square beneath the 
phantom belfry. 

For the Loti-lover this book holds the pleas- 
ure of anticipation and of realization. 

THE MEXICAN PROBLEM. By C. W. Bar- 

ron. Houghton Mifflin; $1. 

Granting that all the facts are as stated by 
Mr. Barren, that he is not far out of the way 
in his deductions, and that his little book is 
worthy of attention, he but touches the surface 
of the Mexican problem as it exists to-day; and 
the problem to-day is very different from what 
it was only a year ago. In his foreword he leads 
us to understand that he will demonstrate that 
the development of the oil fields of our neigh- 
bor to the south will prove the true solution. 
In fact, the solution of the problem must come 
before the oil fields can be satisfactorily operated. 
As he truly says, economic progress is only po>- 
sible where government is firmly established, 
where disorder is suppressed, and where the 
courts mete out justice to all. He has given no 
hint as to how this is to be accomplished. RealK 
his title is misleading. His whole theme is found 
in the two affiliated oil companies the Pan- 
American in California and the Mexican Petro- 
leum. 

The author says that the United States can 
never take its proper attitude toward its sister 
republic until two popular, but false, impres- 
sions are removed. First, that the natural 
wealth of the country has furnished a base for 
contending business interests from the States to 
promote Mexican quarrels; and second, that the 
land question is at the bottom of those troubles. 
It is true that the land question was only a tem- 
porary war-cry, for every attempt to give land 
to the natives has proved a failure. On the 
other hand, there is much to show that the 
Madero revolution was fomented by certain 
business interests in this country in order to get 
rid of Diaz, and thus obtain greater power. 
Attention is called to the wavering policies of

President Wilson in dealing with the Mexican 
situation. Everyone familiar with the situation 
will agree that "We have no right to strike down 
the governments of Mexico one after another 
and refuse to the government and people finan- 
cial, business, and political assistance." The real 
problem is that of "one civilization and one 
order, one rule and procedure, in contact 
with another civilization, another order, pro- 
cedure and morality." This problem was 
what the Diaz administration was scienti- 
fically studying and beginning to solve, as the 
publication of Peust's monograph demonstrated. 
It is true that "at the present time the larger 
part of the good people of Mexico are children 
who want to be in debt and at the same time 
care-free." The average peon suspects and 
avoids the owner of a hacienda who will not per- 
mit him to sell himself into peonage. Very few 
have sufficient persistent energy to make good 
industrial operatives. They do not want oppor- 
tunity to labor. We solved the Indian problem 
by driving the Indians from the soil and exter- 
minating them. Mexico has tried to solve it by 
protecting these child peoples and at the same 
time stimulating those found worthy of indus- 
trial activity. 

HENRY THOREAU AS REMEMBERED BY A 
YOUNG FRIEND. By Edward Waldo Em- 
erson. Houghton Mifflin; $1.25. 
Dr. Emerson, who was about seventeen years 
old when Thoreau died, has retained through the 
fifty-five years since that premature death some 
vivid memories of the strangely gifted man who 
was a frequent visitor at the Emerson house and 
a favorite elder playmate and sagacious coun- 
sellor of the Emerson children. The remem- 
brances now presented in book form were in part 
first given to interested hearers twenty-seven 
years ago in the form of a lecture designed to 
correct prevalent misapprehensions as to both 
Thoreau's character and the events of his life. 
Amplified now with passages from the journals 
of both Thoreau and the writer's father, and 
enlivened with scraps of personal reminiscence 
from some of Thoreau's contemporaries, these 
illuminating glimpses of a strongly marked and 
splendidly independent but too often misunder- 
stood personality are a welcome addition to the 
rather meagre literary product called forth by 
the Thoreau centennial. In this little book 
Thoreau the idealist stands justified for his re- 
fusal to devote the best years of his life to pencil- 
making and money-getting. That he should have 
been thought by a competent authority to need 
any such justification at this late day is note- 
worthy. 



A GERMAN DESERTER'S WAR EXPERI- 
ENCE Translated by J. Koettgen. Huebsch ; 
$1. 

Serial publication in German and the appear- 
ance of specimen chapters in English had already 
prepared a welcome for this anonymous narra- 
tive upon its publication in book form. The 
writer's deep hatred of war and all its works, 
not only the actual bloodshed and cruelty, but 
also the unnatural and humiliating relations of 
men to officers in the German army itself, speaks 
in every page and explains this pacific soldier's 
determined and at last successful attempt to get 
free of the whole loathsome business. A dash 
across the Dutch boundary and an Atlantic voy- 
age as stowaway accomplished the end in view, 
and we leave the author enlisted in the ranks of 
American socialism as a fighter against capital- 
ism, to the pernicious power of which he ascribes 
the war. The whole story is told with the vivid- 
ness that comes of recent deep and indelible im- 
pressions of soul-stirring experiences. 

GERMANISM FROM WITHIN. By A. D. 

McLaren. Dutton; $3. 

It is easy to be wise after the event ; hence the 
multitude of what may be called ex post facto 
prophets of the war. Nevertheless Mr. A. D. 
McLaren, in his presentation of the symptoms 
long since pointing to Germany's present violent 
malady, writes with a first-hand knowledge of his 
subject that commands the reader's serious at- 
tention. For thirty years, he tells us, Germany 
has been the core of his thought, and the last 
seven of these years he spent in close con- 
tact with Germans of all sections and classes. 
Finally, his residence in the country and his study 
of its institutions were rounded off by an eight 
months' sojourn in the concentration camp at 
Ruhleben. Long before the war his purpose had 
been formed to produce an exhaustive analysis 
of German Kultur; and though his present book 
falls short of being exhaustive, it gives far more 
than a superficial view of the various activities 
and characteristics and tendencies in which stu- 
dents of Germany have been and still are inter- 
ested. One leading purpose of the book is "to 
bring to the surface some of the hidden forces 
and strivings long at work in Germany, to show 
the trend of contemporary feeling and policy as 
something more than an externality or an aber- 
ration, and allow Deutschtum to unfold itself, 
its attitude to a wonderful age, its 'mission' to 
the English mind." Thus the book is no mere 
by-product of the war. It is the careful work of 
a patient observer who has for thirty years been 
studying the politics, industry, education, char-, 
acter, and ideals of the German people.

NOTBS ON NBW FICTION 

In some books a great character is created; 
for which all else is forgiven. But in "The Soul 
of a Bishop" (Macmillan; $1.50), Mr. H. G. 
Wells has produced only a soul, a busy, inquisi- 
tive, aspiring soul, a solitary and almost disem- 
bodied soul, in custody of a bishop not the 
bishop, because no such definite person comes into 
being. A bishop, who wears gaiters, accompanies 
the soul through the 300 pages of its purgatory, 
a bishop who suggests in his detachment from the 
suffering soul and in his own impersonality that 
he is only a counterfeit presentment of H. G. 
Wells leading around the Wells soul for pur- 
poses of public exhibition. Those who are fond 
of Mr. Wells must perforce feel affection for 
his very interesting soul and find pleasure and 
satisfaction in its development. 

Sympathetically, one wishes that the environ- 
ment provided had been more real and attrac- 
tive. The scenes and characters of the book 
have the artistic bareness of the stage-settings 
of ultra-modern drama. It is left to the imag- 
ination to complete the background. Neither the 
palace at Princhester in which we find the soul, 
with a bishop, nor the dark and crowded little 
London house in which we leave the soul with 
one Edward Scrope, formerly a bishop, is a hab- 
itable residence. But their flatness serves as a 
consistent setting for the vague minor characters 
who move around up stage. Mr. Wells almost 
apologizes for the few "domestic details" he 
gives, "irrelevant as they may seem in a spirit- 
ual history," and it is plain that he regards the 
supporting cast of his star soul as equally irrele- 
vant. Lady Ella, wife of a bishop, wanders on 
and off the stage and furnishes the righteous, 
colorless foil for an unrighteous, colorful adorer 
of the soul's attendant. This indiscreet adorer, 
Lady Sunderbund, almost comes to life in her 
childish sorrow when an unfrocked bishop re- 
fuses her offer of a garish temple for the new 
religion the soul is creating. Then the soul, 
possibly fearing the competition of any other 
reality, promptly ends Lady Sunderbund's hopes 
and with them her momentary existence. 

Mr. Wells has put all his great power of 
thought and expression into the monologue of the 
soul which is the purpose of his writing. The 
action is incidental. The soul moves about, ges- 
ticulates, postures, disrobes, flagellates itself, and, 
through a series of strenuous contorting exer- 
cises, transforms a sickly, feeble, and inert soul- 
existence into a ruddy, muscular, and energetic 
soul-force. In order to embody this spiritual 
history the author ostensibly transforms Edward 
Scrope, bishop of the orthodox church, into Ed- 
ward Scrope, a servant of God. But whereas 



Edward Scrope is unconvincing, the soul is a 
real creation. 

It is worse than useless to attempt to condense 
into a few sentences Mr. Wells's evolution of 
true religion out of false creeds. That to which 
so powerful a writer has devoted an entire book 
cannot be thus compressed with fairness either 
to him or to the reader. It is better simply to 
record that the soul is hard-thinking, hopeful, 
and unafraid. Many, who are to-day making a 
long-neglected search into their own spiritual 
natures and finding plumbless depths, vast unex- 
plored spaces, and unconquerable heights, will 
find intense interest in the experiences of this 
soul of a bishop, and at the journey's end come 
to a like understanding with Mr. Wells: "Faith 
is a sort of tour de force. A feat of the imag- 
ination. . . One perceives it clearly only in rare 
moments." If the reader is incapable of one of 
those "rare moments" in which he can perceive 
the value of this soul's confession, he should not 
ascribe his failure to Mr. Wells, who has not 
only delivered a message of high inspiration, but 
has striven painstakingly to make the value of 
that message clear to all minds not sealed in with 
stupidity or intellectual arrogance. 

Like a good many actors, Mr. Will N. Har- 
ben, author of "The Triumph" (Harper; 
$1.40), finds it harder to put himself into a 
straight part than a character part. The South 
of the negro, the carpet-bagger, and the eccen- 
tric and despised Yankee of Civil War times, is 
very real to him. It is when he tries to portray 
the South through the character of the old-time 
southern gentleman that he falls somewhat short 
of verisimilitude. His point of view is of one 
who sees situations and events in a broad way, 
and who interprets them through his knowledge 
of the average man with his oddities, his stupidi- 
ties, his pretensions. Mr. Harben makes us feel 
the overpowering importance to the men and 
women of the sixties of the things that to-day 
seem unimportant. He really has a good point 
to make, and he makes it in spite of the common- 
place melodrama to which his plot lends itself. 

"My Mother and I," by E. G. Stern (Mac- 
millan: $1), describes the loftier and rarer as- 
pect of immigration. It carries the conviction 
that behind the "problem" there are high ideals 
shaping the courses of our second-generation for- 
eigners, carrying individuals through education 
and change to an Americanism that reflects a 
truer conception of liberty than our proverbial 
native spread-eagleism. The immigrant with as- 
pirations meets the educational reformer in a 
singleness of purpose that creates the most legiti- 
mate hope for American democracy. It is such 
an immigrant that the present author describes, 
in a narrative of simplicity and charm.

Patience Worth's three-hundred-thousand- 
word novel, "The Sorry Tale" (Henry Holt; 
$1.90), was dictated, we are told, letter by let- 
ter, by means of the ouija board to Mrs. John 
H. Curran, of St. Louis. Men and women of 
intelligence and discretion witnessed the phe- 
nomenon in part and were even sharers in it. 
They vouch for the authenticity of the spirit- 
author and her graciousness. When passages of 
particular difficulty appeared, she would stop her 
tale to comment upon them; and when the book 
was completed, she even went so far as to desig- 
nate to Mrs. Curran in the presence of her pub- 
lishers in New York her choice of binding and 
cover design. It appears, therefore, that "The 
Sorry Tale" is Patience Worth's own, from title 
to finis. 

The story is laid in the time of Christ, and 
concerns itself principally with the son of a re- 
jected Roman courtesan and Tiberius Caesar, 
Hatte by name, whose life is exactly synchronous 
with Christ's, though appallingly antipodal. The 
contrast is made strikingly manifest in the scene 
on Calvary, when the incarnation of hate and 
the incarnation of love hang side by side on 
crosses in reality of their own rearing. The 
plot, stripped of verbiage, is consistent and 
straightforward ; many of the incidents are amaz- 
ingly dramatic or poetic; and the presentation of 
the life then extant in Palestine is accurate and 
full. To find these things, however, the average 
reader will have to master a style that is neither 
fish nor fowl in part the language of the 
Stuarts, in part the language of metaphysics. 
Largely, however, the language is that of Pa- 
tience Worth, a strange and tedious mixture of 
beauty and prolixity. When Caanthus says, 
"Thou art long, Panda, long. . . Tarry not," 
we breathed an "amen" in the general direction 
of the unseen author. 

"Everything here is melodious, old-world, and 
set to^ measure: like a minuet of Bocherini." 
So says Sir Harold Carne in a letter to his friend 
Launcelot Moult, Esquire, in "Dandelions," a 
first novel by a new writer, Coulson T. Cade. 
If the story were the consummation of all its 
author evidently wished for it, this statement of 
Sir Harold's would be its best possible descrip- 
tion. There is charm and to spare in the pic- 
tures of English country life that are presented 
in dissolving succession; the felicitous chapter 
headings suggest something of the color and the 
old-fashioned fragrance of the descriptive pas- 
sages: "Pear-Drops," "Tulips," "Larks and 
Buttercups," "Spice," "Roses," and so forth. But 
the machinery of Mr. Cade's narrative rumbles 
and groans too audibly at too frequent intervals; 
the plot is superficial, even flimsy, and the char- 



acterization shallow. The plot has one ques- 
tionable merit: the insouciance with which it 
deals with certain bodily functions that we are 
usually taught to regard as pornographic. That 
such a story offends so little is due largely to the 
charm of the author's style. (Knopf ; $1.50.) 

With "Understood Betsy" (Holt; $1.30) 
Dorothy Canfield returns to the scene of her 
"Hillsboro People." Betsy, a little girl who has 
been too vigorously understood by her Aunt 
Frances, is brought into the sensible companion- 
ship of her country cousins, and thereby changes 
from an incipient neurotic into a healthy young- 
ster that everyone who reads her story will like. 
The book is intended primarily for children, but 
Mrs. Fisher with her usual insight has touched 
upon a modern tendency in education with an 
irony that will be appreciated by their elders. 
This is a relatively slight tale but one that will 
not lessen her reputation as a thoughtful and 
clever writer. 

Those who like books as well as those who like 
people will get a vast amount of pleasure out of 
Christopher Morley's "Parnassus on Wheels" 
(Doubleday, Page; $1.25). This is the woman's 
side of "Adventures in Contentment," and its 
whimsical humor in showing the domestic tem- 
per of the literary vagabond will meet with 
wide appreciation. This is the story of a "liter- 
ary" farmer's sister, who revolts and takes to the 
open road on her own account. Her misadven- 
tures and the philosophy of the "Perfessor," 
whose book-van supplies her with the oppor- 
tunity to escape the career of domestic drudge, 
make unusually good reading. Mr. Morley com- 
bines genuine understanding of the "bookish" 
temperament with humor that is irresistible. 

Mr. Wallace Irwin exhibits greater talent in 
the choice of a title for his new volume than 
in the stories themselves. The book is called 
"Pilgrims into Folly" (Doran; $1.35) and at 
first sight one wonders whether Mr. Irwin is 
not himself one of the Pilgrims, for it is a little 
difficult to imagine the creator of Hashimura 
Togo being highly successful in the field of 
serious fiction. But in the course of these "ro- 
mantic excursions" he shows that he is capable 
of entering imaginatively into the lives of ideal- 
ists who will sacrifice bodily comfort, public rec- 
ognition, or obvious happiness in behalf of a 
more uncertain, though greater, satisfaction. 
One story, "He Shot the Bird of Paradise," 
stands out from the rest. It has subtlety and 
suspense, and is marred only by a touch of ama- 
teurishness a criticism that applies to the entire 
volume. Mr. Irwin is still a little uncertain of 
his powers, but the present book has definite 
promise.

CASUAL. COMMENT 



IN RESIGNING FROM THE FACULTY OF Colum- 
bia University as a protest against the dismissal 
of Messrs. Cattell and Dana, Professor Charles 
A. Beard has performed a public service of the 
first importance. The vigorous and candid let- 
ter in which he gives his reasons for an act in- 
volving great personal sacrifice squarely raises at 
last an issue that will have to be faced, not in 
Columbia alone, but in every other university in 
the country. Shall a group of trustees "who are 
reactionary and visionless in politics, and narrow 
and mediaeval in religion," determine what our 
educators are to teach? Is the truth to be what 
such men happen to believe or find it to their in- 
terest to impose upon others? Is the status of 
the professor to remain precisely that of the day 
laborer? Is he to be subject to dismissal at the 
will of trustees who are accustomed to deciding 
such questions according to their ideas of what is 
reputable and permissible? Are his colleagues 
on the faculty to have nothing to say as to his 
fitness? If so, then there can be no freedom. In 
making a stand for the democratization of uni- 
versity control, Professor Beard occupies the 
strongest possible position. He was one of the 
most brilliant members of the faculty. His views 
are not those of the men dismissed. He is not a 
pacifist. His attitude to the war has never been 
doubtful. He was, in fact, one of the first to urge 
that we take our place beside the Allies, and in his 
letter of resignation he reiterates his conviction 
that we "should now press forward with all our 
might to a just conclusion." Himself in thor- 
ough sympathy with the ruling majority, he has 
had the courage and the fine idealism to protest 
in the most effective way against the growing 
tendency to terrorize and coerce minority opin- 
ion, to substitute "curses and bludgeons" for ar- 
gument ; thus the implications raised by his letter 
stretch far beyond the immediate struggle in the 
universities. His act is one of the truest patriot- 
ism, and it comes at a time when it is not too late 
to substitute vision for violence in our treatment 
of the disaffected minority. Bitterness and pas- 
sion are accumulating in direct proportion to the 
success with which the intolerant and reaction- 
ary elements in our population are assuming to 
represent our national attitude in the war and 
to suppress all discussion of aims and policies as 
seditious. There is in all this, as the revolt of 
the Columbia students clearly shows, a tragic fail- 
ure on the part of the middle-aged directors of 
opinion, university trustees, and so on, to under- 
stand the psychology of youth, whether in or out 
of the trenches. The old shibboleths and catch- 
words no longer rouse the traditional response 
and the effort to make them the test of loyalty 



can have no other result than to alienate the 
sympathy of the very youth who are bearing the 
burden at the front. Professor Beard is one of 
the few who understand the new spirit, with its 
passion for genuinely constructive service, and 
one hopes that in leaving Columbia he may find 
a broader field in which to serve the interests of 
the kind of democracy to which he is attached. 



IN A RECENT NUMBER OF THE "Mcrcure de 

France," M. Andre Maurel sweats and labors 
at a gigantic task of demolition. He is engaged 
in battering away, with the nib of a pen, at the 
foundations of "Jean-Christophe," that huge 
structure of ten volumes reared to the glory of 
a "humanitarian lie." You fancy that such a 
task, undertaken with such a weapon, is a little 
formidable? By no means; for the ruin is al- 
ready half accomplished. "Dans ce marecage 
silesien s'ecroule la statue de Monsieur Jean- 
Christophe Krafft, entrainant avec elle 1'oeuvre 
entiere de M. Remain Rolland." The French 
have understood Jean-Christophe only since the 
war began. He seemed mild in spite of his art- 
ist's violence; he was clearly an idealist, a musi- 
cian steeped in dreams. He died innocently 
enough on the eve of the invasion, but M. Mau- 
rel points out subtly that he died happy. Why 
happy? Was it not precisely because he had 
served the fatherland loyally as a spy ? M. Mau- 
rel proves to his own satisfaction that "Jean- 
Christophe" is essentially a German novel. 
Jean-Christophe is expansive; he insists on the 
right of the individual to take what he can use 
and to take it wherever he can find it. Applied 
to nations this is the familiar philosophy of might. 
M. Holland's philosophy is the philosophy of 
force! "Jean-Christophe" is German in form. 
Who ever heard of a Frenchman sprawling 
through ten volumes, treating a life, hour by 
hour, from the cradle to the grave, sweeping in 
the whole of civilization? This lack of measure 
and sweet reasonableness how can one think of 
it as French ? No ; the war has quite undone M. 
Rolland and all his works ; and with an amazing 
generosity M. Maurel hands them over to the 
enemy. It is a mistaken generosity at a time 
when his country is sacrificing its most promising 
youth in the trenches; for even in normal times 
what country is likely to offer us a "Jean-Chris- 
tophe" every decade? 



A CHICAGO NOVELIST WAS COMPLAINING bit- 
terly the other day of the isolation in which he 
has to do his work. A man set down in the midst 
of commercialism has to be altogether self-fertil- 
izing. Ideas may come to him from the air and 
set his mind aglow, but there is none of that

swiftness and amplitude of suggestion which 
is possible where the cross-fertilization of other 
minds occupied with the same problems enriches 
and fortifies his own. He spoke with envy of 
the fortunate workmen who are able to utilize 
other men's brains without fear of infringing a 
copyright. They pool their intellectual capital 
and each is able to draw from the common source 
much more than he had put in. They gather 
at a table; someone produces a likely idea; it is 
tossed here and there, mauled and dissected, 
turned inside out, reduced to essentials and 
forced to yield up its last bit of value. The 
result is bound to be illuminating and immensely 
helpful to the writer who wants to develop the 
idea in a work of art. There is indeed a great 
deal to be said for this sort of community think- 
ing, but it has one grave drawback. It offers to 
the vanity of the artist a response so immediate 
and uncritical as to be demoralizing. Why wait 
for the applause of a vague and probably indif- 
ferent public when you can saunter into a cafe' 
and steep yourself in the warmth of more or less 
expert approval? No doubt it is possible for the 
coterie to produce its great men, but they are a 
tough-fibred lot who know precisely how much 
to value group enthusiasm. 

LIBRARIES SERVING A SPECIAL CLASS OF READ- 
ERS have been obliged to meet the challenge of 
the war in various ways. The question presented 
itself whether it would be better in some cases 
to abandon that specialization of function which 
had distinguished them in peace times. Mr. W. 
N. C. Carlton, the librarian in charge of the 
Newberry Library in Chicago, felt that, so far 
as his institution was concerned, it would be 
wiser to reach an accommodation with the ex- 
ceptional conditions than to depart from the li- 
brary's special field, and the solution he worked 
out seems altogether admirable. He assembled 
all the books dealing with the culture, the his- 
tory, and the customs of the countries at war 
with Germany on shelves easy of access, and 
supplemented the collection with a gallery of 
photographs, color-prints, and etchings showing 
the architectural glories and the scenery of the 
allied countries. "I wanted everyone who came 
into the room to realize the grandeur of the civ- 
ilization that had been attacked," said Mr. Carl- 
ton, "and in doing that I believe that I have most 
effectively fulfilled the purpose of the Newberry 
Library." 

IN DISCUSSING THE ENGLISH INTELLECTUALS 

IN WARTIME in the current "Century," Mr. S. 
K. Ratcliffe reminds us once more of the posi- 
tion occupied by the two old English universi- 



ties. Oxford, with its strong classical traditions, 
is the home of orthodoxy. Its leaders, from Gil- 
bert Murray to L. P. Jacks, have revealed 
themselves as the defenders of the government, 
pamphleteers and propagandists at need. Cam- 
bridge, on the other hand, with its mathematical 
and scientific bent, is the home of Bertrand Rus- 
sell, Lowes Dickinson, "the most philosophical 
and persuasive advocate of peace without vic- 
tory," and the conductors of the "Cambridge 
Magazine," the "most resolute band of academic 
internationalists." Mr. Ratcliffe adds that the 
reasons for the contrast might not be hard to 
divine, but he contents himself with recalling 
that "long ago Kant remarked upon the tendency 
of scientific studies toward intellectual remote- 
ness from the passions of contemporary affairs." 
Now that the struggle is on between the classi- 
cists and the advocates of science, the attitude of 
the two great universities is not without its sig- 
nificance. Does the classical discipline naturally 
select minds that are relatively unadventurous, 
infertile, precedent-loving, respectful of author- 
ity, and impatient of change? It we were to 
judge by some of the leading "humanists" of our 
own country, we could hardly be in doubt. 

WHAT WILL LITERATURE BE LIKE after the 
war? One often hears that it will be "nobler" 
than before, and people who talk in that vein 
point out that the actual will be too harsh for 
war-frayed nerves. Men will take books as a 
narcotic. Perhaps. But if we look at some 
of the most vital books that have come to us 
from the trenches, we notice a different temper 
at work. There is often a relentless focusing 
of the horror, a will to realize it to the full, to 
speak for once of the unspeakable. Take Henri 
Barbusse's "Under Fire." You can't help feeling 
in that book an amazing lift and stir, a renewal. 
But what is the source of that feeling? It is 
"the vision of the thrill of reason, logic and sim- 
plicity" that shook the men of his squad "like a 
fit of madness." It is the confused effort to 
think things out. War must be banished. Yes, 
but to get rid of war, one must first get rid of 
privilege, of prejudice and injustice. 'That 
would be fine!' said one. 'Too fine to be true!' 
said another. But the third said, 'It's because 
it's true that it's fine. It has no other beauty, 
mind! And it's not because it's fine that it will 
come. . . It's because it's true that it has to 
be.' " There is plenty of idealism here, but it is 
an idealism eager to use the mind as an instru- 
ment to realize the dream. If such is the temper 
of many of the young generation in the trenches, 
there is little reason to fear a flood of "noble" 
books.

COMMUNICATIONS 



RAGS AND IMMORTALITY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Some time ago a friend of mine issued a book, 
and of course one should think no less of him for 
that. To put forth a volume, indeed, might increase 
one's personal affection for such a friend and even 
arouse a legitimate pride in him as one who has 
received royal recognition or been knighted for 
exceptional service. The authorship of a book, how- 
ever, receives from a great many minds the hom- 
age given to the bearer of evidences of immortality, 
a homage that serves the purposes of a halo, which, 
indeed, some authors accept, sometimes consciously 
and often unconsciously, at its face value. I recall 
a timid debutant in this line telling a friend, that 
he had asked a famous senator to write an intro- 
duction to his forthcoming volume. "Hump!" said 
the friend, "Why should you? Your name will be 
known when his will only be in the buried statistics 
of mere officials." The prospective author had a 
sense of humor, but he no doubt accepted the halo 
subconsciously at least. 

Years passed and I was with that young writer 
when a publisher, a rival publisher, to be sure, 
picked up a copy of his volume and calmly assured 
him that it was printed on sulphite wood-pulp pa- 
per and would last only a few years; "not a rag 
in it," he added, as he tolled the knell of subcon- 
scious hopes. The victim confessed to me that he 
supposed he had written his book merely to con- 
tribute to the knowledge of his own generation, but 
that a slight wrenching of the machinery in the 
cardiac region revealed to himself a subconsciously 
held halo of immortality. 

The other friend, with whom I began this letter, 
was "wiser in his generation," and with a sense of 
humor also. When asked by his publisher what 
kind of paper he preferred, he answered, without 
batting an eye: "One that will last, say, about 
seven hundred years"; to which modest reply, the 
dispenser of immortality promptly showed him a 
sample sheet, adding: "Here's the stuff; it is 33 
per cent rags." To have a Sphinxian secret like 
that spoken aloud seemed incredible to my friend, 
and he passed it on to me as the sesame of immor- 
tality of a ll sizes; for, if 33 per cent rags will 
produce 700 years of immortality, 1 per cent ought 
to give 25 years and mirabUe dictu 100 per cent 
would give 2500 years, which ought to satisfy the 
most fastidious in immortalities! I am told, too, 
that this secret is not copyrighted. 

Never before have I been worried about the per- 
manency of "rag-time," but the very name now has 
a sinister suggestion.

ENGLISH TANKA. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Every lover of poetry is more or less familiar 

with the famous Japanese verselets known as tanka 

and haikai. The word tanka means literally "short 

poem." It is a verselet of thirty-one syllables, 



arranged in five lines of five, seven, five, seven, 
seven syllables respectively. The haikai, or hokku 
(literally "first verses"), is a still shorter poem, 
of only seventeen syllables, arranged like the first 
three lines of the tanka. 

The charm of this Japanese "epigram," as 
Chamberlain translates tanka, is its suggestive or 
impressionistic feature, like the charm of many a 
Japanese painting or picture. It does not express 
all its meaning, but leaves one to read into it the 
full meaning. It is this which makes a Japanese 
tanka so difficult, sometimes absolutely impossible, 
of translation into expressive English. And it is 
especially difficult to translate it into English verse. 

However, it is not our purpose now to discuss 
the Japanese tanka at length, but to call attention 
to what may, perhaps, be termed English tanka. 
They have been written by Rev. S. H. Wain- 
wright, D.D., secretary of the Christian Literature 
Society of Japan, and are published by that society 
(Tokyo). The author has been an English teacher 
and missionary in Japan for about thirty years 
and is well versed in both the Japanese language 
and Japanese literature. But his tanka are not 
translations; they are original. 

The first verselet, which adorns the title-page, 
under a picture of Mount Fuji, is entitled 
"Advent" and reads as follows: 

In time's long record naught 
To perfection has been brought. 
Whence Fuji's sudden advent, 
Faultless and without precedent, 
Into the flight of years? 

The following is a beautiful interpretation of 
the feeling of "Crowds Viewing Cherry Blossoms" 
in Uyeno Park, Tokyo. 

Solomon was not robed like one of these 

Ten thousand spring-blown cherry trees. 

Nor gazed the Shebaean Queen with more surprise 

Than the Uyeno throng whose souls uprise 

To beauty as whitecaps to the breeze. 

And the following on "Nirvana," written "near 
a Buddhist monastery," is another good "sample." 

Boom! wailed the temple bell. 
And the sound rose and fell, 
Like life and death. 
It moaned and sobbed, 
Like a lingering sorrow, 
And gently died away 
As day sinks into night 
With no to-morrow. 

The pessimism of that is balanced by this one 
on "Optimism": 

If you say that seared sadness 
Lurks behind all laughing eyes, 
I reply that grace may cause this, 
By turning sorrow! into joys; 
As from bed* of slime and vileness 
Lotus flowers in beauty rise. 
Finally here is a real gem, written at Hono- 
lulu, in 1915: 

No sky without a cloud, 

No heart without a sigh, 

No closet without a shroud, 

In every Eden a Molokai.

EDUCATING THE BOOKSELLER. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
Local pride, as well as a desire to help the future 
historian, prompts me to correct a slight misstate- 
ment in your interesting paragraph on bookselling 
education in your issue of September 13. You 
say that this educational movement was first taken 
up in Philadelphia, whereas the excellent work in- 
augurated in the William Penn Evening High 
School, of that city, by Dr. Lucy Wilson, was a 
direct outgrowth of the lecture course conducted 
in New York City by the Booksellers' League, 
through the medium of a committee of which I 
was the chairman. This work antedated the Phila- 
delphia course by about two years.

"GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, 

FOR THE PEOPLE" 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In a note concerning the source of Lincoln's "gov- 
ernment of the people, by the people, for the peo- 
ple," an American illustrated weekly some time ago 
quoted two phrases of Theodore Parker which, 
although distantly resembling Lincoln's line, are by 
no means identical with it. The journal in ques- 
tion credits O. H. Carmichael with having pointed 
out the two passages in his book, "Lincoln's Gettys- 
burg Address." Commenting upon the resemblance 
and the difference between Parker's and Lin- 
coln's phrasing, the editor remarks: "Lincoln's 
masterly paraphrase of the idea, when making it his 
own in his famous address, shows his unerring in- 
stinct for terse and forcible English." 

The matter seems of sufficient interest and im- 
portance to invite additional comment. Appar- 
ently it is not generally known that in a speech 
which Parker delivered at the New England Anti- 
Slavery Convention in 1850 he employed a phrase 
virtually identical in form with the one which Lin- 
coln's address has made so familiar. It is contained 
in the following passage: 

There is what I call the American idea. . . This 
idea demands ... a democracy, that is, a govern- 
ment of all the people, by all the people, for all the 
people. [Italics mine]. . . That is one idea; and 
the other is, that one man has a right to hold another 
man in thraldom, not for the slave's good, but for the 
master's convenience . . . For shortness' sake, I 
will call this the idea of Slavery. It demands . . . 
an aristocracy, that is, a government of all the people, 
by a part of the people the masters; for a part of the 
people the masters; against a part of the people 
the slaves. 

Parker, as we see, is contrasting all the people 
with part of the people; the antithesis is clear and 
deliberate; moreover, it obviously accounts for his 
use of the qualifying "all" in the italicized passage. 
Aside from this single word, however, his phrasing 
and Lincoln's are identical. Parker's priority, it 
would seem, entitles his name to be remembered in 
connection with the terse formulation of the prin- 
ciple of ideal democracy which adorns the mem- 
orable Gettysburg address.

LETTERS AND DIARY OF ALAN SEEGER 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I have read and reread the review by Mr. Kinne 
of "The Letters and Diary of Alan Seeger" in a 
recent issue of THE DIAL. The review is interest- 
ing, and in some respects I am in accord with the 
views expressed, but it seems to me the reviewer 
has failed utterly to catch the real value of the 
publication. 

For instance, there are the letters of the poet to 
his mother. Seeger seems from the first anxious 
to have her approval, and equally anxious that she 
should be brave and proud in the event of his death 
(see pages 3, 8, 70, 119, 175). But deeper than his 
attitude toward his mother is his attitude toward 
the war. He is no soldier of fortune. He is there 
from principle. The diary and letters are replete 
with evidences of his effort to key his courage up 
to the sticking-point and to meet the supreme test 
with a noble spirit when it should come. It is his 
motive in enlisting, touched on here and there 
throughout the book, and his cultivation of courage 
for the supreme test that make his letters to his 
mother so fine. 

I do not agree with the reviewer that Alan See- 
ger meant that we are all "cowards, hypocrites and 
fools" because we cannot fight and must do our 
bit in "second-best things." The quotation begin- 
ning "But as in times of peace," is taken from the 
middle of a paragraph in which he says that it is 
"disheartening" that other nations should be brought 
into the war. He had hoped that it could be won 
without this necessity. But at the same time he 
felt "There should be no neutrals but everyone 
should bear some part of the burden." No better 
evidence of Seeger's breadth of mind and his sense 
of appreciation of vital support given the soldier, 
can be asked than his excoriation of a criticism pub- 
lished in America: 

I should not think that I would need to tell you 
that that article is simply the low joke of a mind 
that thinks it funny to tell lies. If his letters did 
nothing worse than belittle his comrades who are here 
for motives that he is unable to conceive, it would be 
only dishonourable. But when it comes to throwing 
discredit on the French government that in all its 
treatment of us has been generous beyond anything 
that anyone would think possible, it is too shameful 
for any words to characterize. (Letter to his mother, 
March 12, 1915). 

And now that he has met the death of his dreams, 
now that he has disappeared at the pinnacle of his 
cherished career, we neither remember, nor can 
believe, the words of Victor Chapman, quoted by 
Mr. Kinne, that Seeger was "an appalling wreck" 
before the war. Not only was he found physically 
fit to enlist, but the letters and diary show that he 
endured long marches and other hardships, and the 
moral tone of all the letters and diary is that of 
an unusual personality, a noble son, and an uncom- 
plaining, manly soldier.

"Lake and Stream Game Fishing," hy Dixie Car- 
roll (Stewart & Kidd ; $1.75), is more useful than 
many recent books on angling in that it gives minute 
and specific instructions, some of them intended for 
the mere novice, some valuable to the experienced 
sportsman. Unfortunately the author seems ob- 
sessed with the idea that to be interesting he must 
be slangy. The reader is continually addressed as 
"Old Man" and "Old Scout," and a rod or reel 
never costs ten dollars, but "sets you back" or 
"creases your bank roll" to that amount. A stu- 
dent of Walton is tempted to the cynical remark 
that the English is what might be expected of a 
man who favors self-thumbing and self-spooling 
reels; but this doubtless betrays a hopelessly old- 
fashioned taste in both tackle and literary style. 

The author of "A Dominie's Log" has now 
become the hero of "A Dominie Dismissed" (Mc- 
Bride; $1.25). Mr. A. S. Neill, for all his re- 
jection at the hands of the rigid-minded parents 
of the quaint Scotch village, has not allowed his 
train of thought to be side-tracked, and the results 
of his roadside reflections are quite as entertaining 
as they ever were. "My whole theory of educa- 
tion," he says, "is built on my abject humility." 
He finds that discipline breeds lack of discrimina- 
tion and lack of good taste in the teacher as well 
as in the child ; he believes that education is noth- 
ing more nor less than individual thinking, in- 
dividual investigation, self-development. He sees 
no more reason for the teacher to impose rules 
and punishments, except as between man and man. 
than for the pupil to do the same. In other words, 
his credo is based upon a justifiable democracy 
one that we are apt to ignore the democracy of 
age and youth. That this is the only right spirit 
upon which to establish pedagogy (horrible word) 
we are absolutely assured. But does it work? 
Let Mr. Neill answer for that in his own manner. 

"Around the Year in the Garden," by Frederick 
F. Rockwell (Macmillan; $1.75), is just the clear- 
est and most helpful kind of information for the 
busy man or woman who wants to get ready for 
next year's gardening. The book takes for granted 
a fair-sized garden space and a more than dilettante 
ambition for gardening. Pictures of Mr. Rock- 
well's own gardens and the things he grows in them 
from tomatoes to geraniums, incite one to feats of 
calculation trying, for instance, to make one's pos- 
sible yearly savings encompass a plot of ground be- 
fore the back gets too old for pulling weeds and 
hoeing. 

In "An Old New England School" (Houghton 
Mifflin; $4.) Dr. Claude M. Fuess, of the English 
department at Phillips Academy, Andover, and a 
specialist in the history of that famous school, offers 
a substantial octavo of 548 pages full of the vary- 
ing fortunes, the ups and downs, the tragedies and 
comedies, that mark the century and a quarter of 
academic life covered by the historian. With the 
close of Dr. Bancroft's administration, in the first 
year of the present century, the chronicle comes to 
an end; and thus nearly a half of the entire period 
under survey belongs to the reigns (separated only

by a short interregnum) of "Uncle Sam" Taylor 
and the well-beloved "Banty." The founder and 
his family, the struggling beginnings of the school, 
the early teachers, various student activities besides 
those prescribed in the catalogue, the notable later 
development of the institution in material resources 
and equipment, with passing sidelights on the The- 
ological Seminary and on the sister school at Ex- 
eter of such material is the book composed, and 
it is written in a style to commend it even to read- 
ers so unfortunate as never to have been enrolled 
as either students or teachers on the classic "Hill" 
devoted to sacred and profane learning. The mere 
fact that Oliver Wendell Holmes was there fitted 
for college, as we know from his own pen, is 
enough to make the academy and its history objects 
of unfailing interest. 

Students of unfortunate Francis Thompson's po- 
etry will find interest in an attractively bound little 
book, "Francis Thompson Essays," issued at Can- 
ton, Ohio, by the Franklin Publishing Company. 
It contains two essays by Benjamin Fisher, an Ohio 
manufacturer, who died in 1916 and who devoted 
much of his time, during his last years, to a study 
of Thompson's work. With portraits and biog- 
raphies of both men, it serves the purpose of a 
double memorial volume. The author places the 
subject of his pages as follows: "In imagination 
we dare not attempt such an impossible thing as 
a classification by comparison. The greatest fac- 
ulty of analysis, a function of the lower order of 
mind we denominate 'reason,' utterly fails at its 
approach to this highest reach of mentality. The 
sacred writers of Biblical times called this power 
Vision,' the modern author names it 'invention,' 
the popular view accepts it as 'illusion,' but its 
highest form is surely intuition and revelation. 
With this rare gift alone we reach beyond the con- 
fines of sensuous being; and in such a state, whether 
acquirement or endowment, Thompson dwells in 
natural, voluntary activity." A list of Thompson's 
published works, necessarily brief, concludes the 
volume. 

Mr. Alfred Noyes touches a chord of response 
in his readers by his facility in rhythmic, picturesque 
utterance. This facility is often fatal to his ex- 
cellence as a poet, but it adapts itself readily to the 
description of German frightfulness on the high 
seas, which is the subject of a little book of sketches 
called "Open Boats" (Stokes; 50 cts.). These 
scenes of murder and wilful abandonment were 
designed, it appears, as a moving plea for the active 
alliance with his own countrymen of the hitherto 
neutral Americans. That object no longer exists, 
but if any American is still in doubt about the rea- 
sons for our cooperation in the war, "Open Boats" 
is recommended as a good tonic and restorative. 

"The Sense of Taste," by H. L. Hollingworth 
and A. T. Poffenberger (Moffat, Yard; $1.25), is 
the first in a series of great promise and interest. 
Readable monographs on the functions of the sev- 
eral senses have not been prepared for a great many 
years, and substantially not at all in English. In

rapid, and the point of view from which the serv- 
ices of the senses are now regarded has decidedly 
altered. The book by Professors Hollingworth 
and Poffenberger gives in simple form the entire 
series of facts regarding the sense of taste, and 
points out the interesting aspects of its evolution, 
as well as its practical and aesthetic value. We 
are apt to underestimate the importance of the 
so-called lower senses and practically to forget that 
their significance still holds, despite our changed en- 
vironment. Apart from its ministry, along with 
the sense of smell, to food acceptances and re- 
jections, the sense of taste stands as the type of 
aesthetic preference. It represents the large in- 
dividual differences concerning which there may be 
little purpose in dispute, but very positive value in 
an understanding of their contributions to the men- 
tal life. 

In "The Retreat from Mons," that heart-break- 
ing military disaster and glorious moral victory is 
described briefly, authoritatively, and graphically 
by a member of the British General Staff (Hough- 
ton Mifflin; 50 cts.). Beneath the superstructure 
of official facts one glimpses heroism and sacrifice 
the details of which will never be known, but which 
distinguish the retreat above many engagements 
that history will note more carefully. In their 
baptism of fire on Belgian soil the little expedition- 
ary force set the future British army a memorable 
and difficult example. "Such courage and patience, 
such humorous resignation and cheerfulness in ad- 
versity, are to be paralleled only in the finest armies 
of history." Their most fitting memorial is this 
brief, soldierly, vivid account of the retreat. 

William Allan Neilson has a trifle too much 
subtlety and coolness in his method to "do" Burns, 
the romantic poet, drinker, and lover, with any 
great amount of enthusiasm; it is Burns the Scotch- 
man whom he really warms to in his "Burns: How 
to Know Him" ( Bobbs-Merrill ; $1.50). The pres- 
ent reviewer wishes the editors of the series had 
given him Meredith and a little freer hand about 
the necessity of much quotation and the inclusion 
of bibliographical detail. Then we might have had 
the delight, and it is a delight, of Professor Neilson 
at his best. But the present volume is at least 
worth while, discriminating and well up to the stan- 
dard of the series. 

Of the making of textbooks there is no end, espe- 
cially of textbooks in English composition. But 
occasionally a volume appears which from its 
preface onward towers above the jumble of its 
competitors. Such a volume is the "English Com- 
position" of Professor C. N. Greenough and Mr. 
F. W. C. Hersey (Macmillan; $1.40). The ar- 
rangement of the contents is unexceptionable; the 
five parts deal respectively with the gathering and 
weighing of material, the kinds of composition, 
structure, diction, and mechanics. Better even 
than the arrangement, however, is the excellence of 
the presentation. This is manifestly the result of 
years of dose study of the actual problems of 
composition, and is without a trace of that be- 
wilderment which quickly shatters our confidence in 
most volumes covering this field.

Apart from its title, which is altogether too 
general, "The Psychology of Special Abilities and 
Disabilities," by Augusta F. Bronner, (Little, 
Brown; $1.75), may be unreservedly commended. 
It is not a study of special abilities and disabilities, 
except in the narrow field of the study of children 
likely to be brought up for psychopathic examina- 
tion. It is largely a record of cases, and in a 
measure is a pioneer contribution. The clinical 
material thus accumulated is admirably considered 
and presented in regard to the types of defect and 
superiority which unusual cases present. These 
are arranged first with regard to the educational 
aspect as presented by unusual capacity or incapa- 
city for number work, for the use of language, 
more specifically for spelling or reading or writing, 
and then in the special study of separate mental 
processes which present distinctly irregular per- 
formances. These include memory, association, 
imagination, and deficiencies in mental control. The 
next stage in advance would be the determination 
of the types of mental deficiency and superiority 
for which the tests serve as outward expressions. 
That these tendencies, when psychologically studied, 
will show interesting parallels with similar failures 
in the decay of mental powers, may be foreseen. 

In "Nichiren, the Buddhist Prophet" (Harvard 
University Press; $1.25), Masaharu Anesaki, 
professor of the science of religions at the Imper- 
ial University of Tokio, and for two years profes- 
sor of Japanese literature and life at Harvard, 
has given a biography of a reformer of Japanese 
Buddhism. In Japan, as in Western Europe, the 
thirteenth century was a period of transition and 
of great intellectual activity. Buddhism, which had 
existed in the islands for several centuries, was 
divided into several sects, each with its faults 
Nichiren set out to reform it. The essence of his 
work was the preaching of the prime importance 
of the "Lotus of the Perfect Truth," a book 
occupying in the Buddhist scriptures a place analo- 
gous to that of the Johannine writings in the 
Bible. Owing to the persecutions to which he 
was subjected to by his countrymen, Nichiren's 
life was a stormy one, and he narrowly escaped 
martyrdom. Disciples gathered about him, neverthe- 
less, and a sect bearing his name has existed in 
Japan down to the present day. In the past this 
sect has not been so important as certain others, 
but according to our author, it is receiving renewed 
attention in Japan to-day. 

It cannot be said that Andrew S. Ferenczi's 
"Contributions to Psycho- Analysis" (Badger; $3) 
is particularly important, or that it brings forward 
matter that has not already been sufficiently em- 
phasized. Indeed, its general trend goes back to 
the early statements of psychoanalysis, in which 
the formulation of principles was rather overdone 
in view of the evidence then obtainable. The ex- 
treme insistence upon the sexual interpretation of 
every trifling incident is itself so dominant that it 
leaves little room for other varieties of interpreta- 
tion. As a part of the general literature of the 
subject, the book has its use. It shows ability and 
a grasp of the mental mechanisms, but in no other 
wav can it be said to be notable.

The auction sales of books held thus far in this 
country during the present season indicate that the 
war taxes and other burdens have not affected 
prices. The recent sale by Stan V. Henkels, 1304 
Walnut Street, Philadelphia, of the collection 
owned by J. Levering Jones of that city, was nota- 
ble for the average high sums paid for the material 
offered. 

In the sale of Americana and other books from 
the library of the late Frank B. Sanborn, of Con- 
cord, Massachusetts, and other sources, by C. F. 
Libbie & Co., of Boston, the scarce "Journal of the 
Adventures of Nathen Bunn," reprinted at Litch- 
field in 17% from the first Providence edition, was 
bought by Charles E. Goodspeed for $106. "A 
History of New England," by Edward Johnson, 
small quarto, London, 1654, known as "Johnson's 
Wonder Working Providence," was bought on or- 
der for $165. This copy evidently lacks the two 
supplementary leaves at the end. The author came 
to New England in the fleet with Governor Win- 
throp in 1630. Four years later he went with 
Captain Cooke and forty men to Rhode Island to 
take Samuel Gorton, who had become obnoxious 
to the Massachusetts government. For twenty- 
eight years he was a member of the general court 
of Massachusetts, and at one time a senator. 

"Propositions concerning the subject of Baptism 
and Consociation of Churches," Cambridge, printed 
by S. G. for Hezekiah Usher at Boston in 1662, 
was bought on order for $865. It is an extremely 
rare Cambridge imprint by Samuel Green. It was 
reprinted in England in the same year without the 
printer's name and with a different collation. It 
was credited by Increase Mather to Jonathan 
Mitchcl, pastor of the church at Cambridge. This 
was Increase Mather's own copy, having his auto- 
graph at the upper corner, but it appears very 
faintly since the ink is faded. It also bears the 
autograph of J. R. Lowell, 1844. 

An interesting thing in the rare-book world was 
the recovery a few days ago by Henry E. Hunting- 
ton of a valuable piece of Americana that had been 
stolen from his great library. The story is that, 
while Mr. Huntington and his librarian George 
Watson Cole were in California, someone who 
had access to his collection took from it some scarce 
works and offered them to dealers. One of the 
books, a rare American work, is said to have been 
sold to a dealer for $1000. When Mr. Huntington 
returned to New York, the dealer, who did not 
know that the book had been stolen, called on him 
and offered it for $2000. Mr. Huntington identi- 
fied the book as his own property and regained it. 

A stolen rare book is a very difficult thing to sell. 
At a sale last year in this city by one of the auction 
houses, a copy of the first Philadelphia directory 
was bought by Dr. A. S. W. Rosenbach, of that 
city, for $1900. He put the book in his pocket, and 
went to lunch shortly after noon. By two o'clock 
he had his suspicions aroused as to the book. By

five o'clock he had found out that it was the copy 
owned by the noted collector Brinley. It had 
passed into the possession of Mr. Goelet, from 
whom it had been stolen. Dr. Rosenbach returned 
it to Mr. Goelet. James F. Drake, of New York, 
recently had two presentation copies stolen from 
an express company to which he had intrusted 
them. They passed through various hands and 
eventually were offered to him. He thus recovered 
them. Two books were stolen from Anderson's dur- 
ing the Learmont sale. Not long afterward they 
were offered to George D. Smith, who told the man 
to return with them. Then Mr. Smith called up 
the company and was asked to hold the man when 
he returned. Something frightened the salesman, 
however, who failed to appear. 

Mr. Drake a short time ago purchased a library 
chiefly made up of ordinary books, but containing 
besides, a number of first editions of John Dryden 
and a manuscript copy in Oscar Wilde's autograph 
of his famous poem, "Ballad of Reading Gaol." 
The manuscript has many corrections in Wilde's 
handwriting. Wilde manuscripts bring high prices. 

Full autograph letters signed by former Presi- 
dent William H. Taft are rare. They command 
high prices at public auction. Most of his letters 
are typewritten, being simply signed by him. An 
ordinary one-page, autograph letter signed by him 
fetches at auction from $25 to $35. A fine auto- 
graph letter of his has just been obtained by a col- 
lector. It is eight pages long, written entirely in 
Mr. Taft's hand and addressed to former Justice 
Charles E. Hughes. It relates to the present poli- 
tical campaign in New York City and mentions the 
name of John Purroy Mitchel. Mr. Taft wrote 
the letter because he was unable to attend a public 
dinner in New York. A duplicate of the letter 
was sent to Mr. Hughes, the original passing into 
the possession of the autograph collector. 

The following unpublished letter by Giuseppe 
Garibaldi, the Italian patriot, addressed to George 
P. Marsh, minister plenipotentiary from the United 
States to the new kingdom of Italy, referring to 
Abraham Lincoln, has just come into the possession 
of Gabriel Wells, of New York: 

Caprera, March 27, 1865. 

Very dear Mr. Marsh: The name of Lincoln, like 
that of Christ, marks the beginning of a glorious epoch 
in the history of humanity, and with pride I have per- 
petuated the name of the great Emancipator in my 
family. The press and the other enemies of his great 
Republic are like the asses of the fable who kicked 
the lion believing him dead, but today, when they 
see him arise in all his majesty, they change their 
language. The American question is a light of liberty 
for the world and will gladden the hearts of all hon- 
est men. I greet your wife with all affection and 
respect. 

Yours, 

G. Garibaldi. 

This letter was written less than three weeks 
before Lincoln's assassination. In the summer of 
1861 Lincoln's secretary of state, William H. Sew- 
ard, made an appeal to Garibaldi to lend his sword 
to the United States and tendered him the rank of 
major-general. For various reasons Garibaldi did 
not accept the offer.

HE PASSED many times through the fir- 
ing lines between the German and Bel- 
gians with American dispatches. 

HE WAS in Brussels when the Germans 
entered. 

HE HAD all manner of official and un- 
official dealings with the Germans. 

HE HAD many opportunities to see King 
Albert both in the field under shell fire 
and behind the lines. 

HE SPENT 48 hours trying to save Miss 
Cavell. He argued, plead, and finally 
threatened, without effect. 



This is the most thrilling combination of 
war and diplomacy written day by day on

The Anderson Company, it is now announced, 

will move into its new home in the old Arion Club 

I building, at Park Avenue and 59th Street, on No- 

| vember 15, and will hold its first sale of the season 

on November 20. 

Scott & O'Shaughnessy held a sale at 116 Nas- 
sau Street, New York, on October 25, of first 
> editions of British and American authors. On 
I October 26 they will have a sale of books and 
I pamphlets on American history. On October 19, 
I Stan V. Henkels sold, at 1304 Walnut Street, 
I Philadelphia, the library of John C. Brady of South 
Carolina. It contained copies of Confederate laws, 
local histories, and other Americana. The same 
day the Walpole Galleries of New York held a sale 
of miscellaneous books. 

Gabriel Wells, of New York, has two interest- 
ing and valuable Robert Burns items. One is a 
volume of Edward Young's "The Complaint, or 
Night Thoughts," London, 1788. On the blank 
reverse page of the preface is this autograph in- 
scription: "To Mrs. Mcllhose, [Sic] this Poem, 
the sentiments of the heirs of immortality, told 
in the numbers of Paradise, is respectfully pre- 
sented by Robert Burns." Beneath this the 
recipient wrote, "Mrs. McLehose presents this 
book to Mr. Calpatrick Sharp as a small return 
for all his kindness." Charles Kilpatrick Sharpe, 
the well-known antiquary and friend of Sir Walter 
Scott, wrote on one of the fly-leaves, "On the 2d of 
Oct. 1839, Mrs. M. sent me this book, C. K. S." 
This was forty years after the death of Burns 
and only two years before Mrs. McLehose herself 
died. The volume must have been presented to her 
by Burns almost upon publication, as 1788 was the 
year in which their friendship began. Burns at 
the time did not even know the correct spelling 
of her name. It may be assumed that this volume 
was a gift which opened one of the most famous 
and romantic attachments in the history of litera- 
ture. 

The other item consists of two letters, one by 
Burns, signed "Sylvander," and the other by Mrs. 
McLehose, signed "Clarinda." It was to her that 
Burns addressed the poem, "One Fond Kiss and 
Then We Sever." The letters are in a volume 
with hand-painted miniatures on ivory of Burns 
and his lady love. The whole is bound in a jewelled 
and elaborately tooled full levant morocco binding 
by Sangorski and Sutcliffe. 

Americana from the library of the late Frank 
B. Sanborn, of Concord, Mass., and books from 
other sources were sold by C. F. Libbie & Co., 597 
Washington Street, Boston, on October 3, 4, and 
5. Among the noteworthy items were Edward 
Johnson's "Wonder Working Providence," 1654; 
Dickinson's "Remarkable Deliverance," 1792; New 
England Primer, 1790; Peters 's "History of Con- 
necticut," 1781 ; Wigglesworth's "Meat out of the 
Eater," 1717; Roger Wolcott's "Poetical Medi- 
tations," 1728, and Jonathan Mitchel's "Proposi- 
tions concerning the Subject of Baptism," Cam- 
bridge, Mass., 1662. It was said that only two 
copies, both imperfect, existed of the last-named 
book, but the E. Dwight Church catalogue states 
that five perfect copies are in existence.

A Patriotic Story of the Present War 

THE FLAG 

By Homer Greene 

Author of "Pickett's Gap" 

Penfield Butler, the hero of this inspiring story, 
unthinkingly desecrates the American flag while 
a school boy. How he is shunned by his friends 
and how he makes amends in the present war is 
a tale that will thrill you. 

What the Critics Say: 

"The Flag," by Homer Greene, "is the best 
boys' book I have read for many a day. It 
strikei me as being a kind of junior 'Man 
Without a Country* and as well deserving of 
as wide a reading/' Franklin K. Mathiews, Di- 
rector Library Dept. Boy Scouts of America. 

"A book in which every American boy will 
revel." -Los Angeles Examiner. 

"It teaches patriotism on every page and is 
interesting from start to finish. Utica Daily 
Press. 

"No doubt of its lofty sentiment and inspiring 
purpose." Loa Angela* Tribune. 

"Every patriot who reads it will experience 
some mistiness in the eyes or a lamp in the 
throat." Pittsburgh Chronicle Telegraph.

laine and an English translation of the French text 
by J. Lewis May accompany the pictures. These 
"Pictures of Ruined Belgium" are published by the 
John Lane Co. 

Free verse for the child is the latest develop- 
ment in juvenile literature. Putnam's Sons an- 
nounce "If I Could Fly," by Rose Strong Hubbell 
a delectable collection of "Ifs" that should appeal 
to the wishing child. 

Henry Handel Richardson, author of "The For- 
tunes of Richard Mahoney," it now appears is the 
wife of Professor Robertson of London Univer- 
sity. The book is published in this country by 
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. 

"The Lady of Kingdoms," by Inez Haynes Ir- 
win, has for its underlying theme tbe question 
whether an unmarried woman may have the child 
she desires and no questions asked. The book is 
published by George H. Doran Co. 

Messrs. Boni and Liveright announce "The 
Great Modern French Stories," a chronological 
anthology compiled and edited by Willard Hunt- 
ington Wright with a view to the evolution of the 
art of the modern short story in France. 

"The City Worker's World in America," by 
Mary K. Simkhovitch, is to be used as a text for 
required reading in the Union Theological Semi- 
nary. It is a recent addition to the Macmillan 
Company's "American Social Problem Series." 

A readable volume for general readers desir- 
ing to learn something of the existing state of 
chemical knowledge is Sir William A. Tilden's 
"Chemical Discovery and Invention of the Twen- 
tieth Century," recently published by E. P. Dutton 
& Co. 

The "Poems" of Alan Seeger, which were pub- 
lished last year by Charles Scribner's Sons, have 
gone into their twenty-first thousand. The Scrib- 
ners are bringing out this fall "The Letters and 
Diary of Alan Seeger" and the "Poems" in a limp- 
leather edition. 

Logan Pearsall Smith, author of "Trivia" 
(Doubleday, Page & Co.), is descended from a long 
line of Quaker ancestors, but has lived in England 
since his youth. Some of these "thought studies" 
have been made familiar to Americans by "The 
New Republic" 

A most interesting combination of war interest, 
psychological phenomena, and mystery, with an 
original, if not altogether convincing, explanation of 
the mystery, is Arthur Machen's "The Terror" 
(McBride's). Mr. Machen is an Englishman, and 
the story is laid in England. 

A spot of bright color on the autumn book shelves 
is Helen J. Sanborn's "Anne of Brittany," from the 
press of Messrs. Lothrop, Lee & Shepard. "One 
of the world's great women," says Miss Sanborn, 
who made two trips to France and searched mam 
an obscure record for her material. 

"Recreation and the Church," by Herbert W. 
Gates, director of religious education, The Brick 
Institute, Rochester, N. Y., should find its way 
into the hands of church workers in communities 
where the children shy at Sunday-school. The 
University of Chicago Press publishes it.

A group of German-Americans has just been or- 
ganized in the United States under the name 
"Friends of the German Republic," which is in 
close touch with the group led by Hermann Fernau, 
the author of "The Coming Democracy," recently 
published by E. P. Button & Co. The purpose is 
to help in every way possible the agitation for 
a change in the German form of government. 

Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. announce Mr. 
Hugh Gibson's "A Journal from Our Legation in 
Belgium." Mr. Gibson was secretary of the 
American legation in Brussels prior to the severing 
of our diplomatic relations with Germany. Like 
Mr. Gerard's "My Four Years in Germany," it is 
a graphic representation of conditions from the in- 
side by one who had more than the ordinary oppor- 
tunities for observation. 

Meredith Nicholson's latest story, "A Reversible 
Santa Claus," just published by the Houghton 
Mifflin Co., tells how a burglar stole an automobile 
and later found to his dismay that he had also 
stolen a baby, who had been curled up in the seat 
under a rug. The story was not based on facts 
when it was written, but, obligingly, the facts have 
since come into being via the newspapers, and help 
greatly to advertise the fiction. 

Fleming H. Revell & Co. about three weeks ago 
received from across the water an advance copy 
of a book in which was inserted the card of the 
author from "Somewhere in France." The Ameri- 
can rights to the book were immediately arranged 
for by cable, and the book itself is now ready. 
Under the title "The Cross at the Front," it gives 
a look at the Tommies from a new point of view, 
that of a field chaplain who has been with them in 
the thick of the fight in Flanders. 

The publication of J. P. O. Eland's "Li Hung 
Chang" by Henry Holt & Co. in their series of 
biographies, "Makers of the Nineteenth Century," 
edited by Basil Williams, calls to mind the inter- 
esting departure in biographical literature that 
characterizes this series. Some years ago Mr. Ken- 
neth Bell, a connection of the family interested in 
G. Bell and Sons, of London, and a representative 
of Henry Holt & Co. happened to be talking at 
dinner about some of the features of such note- 
worthy series as the "American Statesmen" and 
"English Men of Letters," and the query arose as 
to whether the time was not ripe for another series 
of the same general standard to include a group 
of prominent figures in the nineteenth century who 
represented comparative vacancies in bibliographical 
lists. It was proposed that these makers of the 
nineteenth century should be treated as world fig- 
ures by having the life of each written by an 
enthusiastic student who was not a native of the 
country represented by the subject of the biography. 
Lord Charnwood's "Abraham Lincoln," recently 
published, shows the results of this reasoning. The 
volumes thus far arranged for are: "Cecil 
Rhodes," by Basil Williams; "Lord Shaftesbury," 
by J. L. Hammond; "Victor Hugo," by Madame 
Duclaux; "General Lee," by Lt.-Colonel F. Mau- 
rice; "Leon Gambetta," by W. Norton Fullerton; 
and "Abdul Hamid," by Sir Edwin Pears. 



"A masterpiece of imaginative realism." 
N. Y. Tribune. 



The Rise of 
David Levinsky 

By Abraham Gahan 

"The book sparkles with felicities of speech 
that set off their truths even as platinum sets off 
a diamond. So, too, with innumerable flashes 
of psychological insight, unobtrusively con- 
veyed. At times this uncanny power of Cahan's 
in evoking an image or crystallizing a person- 
ality strongly recalls Turgenev, just as his epic 
sweep reminds one of that Tolstoi whom he 
has translated and admires so deeply." Boston

THEATRE ARTS 
MAGAZINE 

AN ILLUSTRATED QUARTERLY 

EDITED BY 
SHELDON CHENEY 

During its first year THEATRE ARTS 
MAGAZINE has taken first place among 
publications dealing seriously with the 
theatre in this country. It has provided a 
remarkable reportorial and pictorial record 
of the work being done in the progressive 
playhouses, and it has started a vigorous 
fight against the speculators and commer- 
cial artists who have all but destroyed 
dramatic art in America. It is indispensable 
to those who care for the theatre as an art, 
and to all who are interested in the pro- 
gressive movement in general. 

During the first year it published 200 
pages of essays, news notes, reviews and 
pictures, dealing with the arts of the 
theatre. Among the contributors were 
Mary Austin, Huntly Carter, W. P. 
Eaton, Robert Edmond Jones, H. K. 
Moderwell, Ruth St. Denis, Joseph Urban 
and Zona Gale. 

The second volume begins with the Nov- 
ember issue. Yearly subscription, $1.50; 
single copies, 50c. A few sets of the first 
volume are still for sale at $1.50 for the 
four issues, unbound. A sample copy will 
be sent for 25c.

Introduction by ALICE GERSON CHASE 

The entire career of this intrinsically American 
painter is here covered. Beginning with his early 
impulse to draw, or, as he used to express it, "to 
make pictures for books," it tells of his brief, un- 
happy apprenticeship at Annapolis, his failure to 
make a satisfactory clerk in his father's store, and 
the final achievement of the opportunity to study 
art first in Indianapolis and then in New York. 
The description of his life in New York beautifully 
reflects the atmosphere of that renaissance of paint- 
ing in Europe and America.

The Unpopular Review 

In the brief period of its existence [it] has taken rank as the leading publication of 
criticism and brilliant comment on current affairs on either side of the Atlantic. From the 
Editor of the Providence Journal. 

We may say for the benefit of our readers outaide of New England and New York that there the literary 
judgements of TA Providence Journal command as much respect as those of the leading metropolitan dailies. 

To carry a copy ... is almost equivalent to wearing a badge of intelligence. 
From a circular issued from the retail department of the Messrs. Putnam's bookstore. 

The freshness of its points of view is invigorating. The crying need of the weary old 
world is to get away from conventional view points ; conventional morality and conventional 
taste. 

[We stand up for most of the "conventional morality and conventional taste." But many a "point of view" 
from which they have hitherto been mapped seems to us no longer tenable, and we often try to base our surveys 
upon new ones. Editor.] 

. . . the most virile and interesting magazine that I have ever seen. 

It had the look of a good half hour morsel before bed-time and it postponed bed-time 
by just over three hours. 

I have read it through from cover to cover since the issuance of the first number . . . 
easily the ablest review of a general nature we have in this country. From a Judge of a 
State Supreme Court. 

It is pleasing indeed to find ... so apparent a desire to declare the truth and of 
necessity be named "unpopular." 

Far and away the most stimulating appeal to the intellectuals that has yet been made 
by our periodical literature. I can imagine but one possible hinderance to your abundant 
success your falling into the snare that has been the ruin of all previous claims upon the 
illuminati, viz: the notion that only agnostics are intellectual. From a Clergyman. 

[No danger! The number of clergy among our contributors and subscribers fore fends that, let alone our 
own fervent belief in the essentials of religion. Editor.] 

The most delightful magazine I have yet seen . . . something else must go for 
I must have The Unpopular. 

The copy that I received had the most intelligent treatment of the suffrage question I 
have ever seen ... I would like all my fool sisters to be so enlightened. 

A breath from the heights of Parnassus.

behind the lines. Learn the truth and see that copies of this splendid

impressions of the conditions at the front. 

Boston Transcript: "An exceedingly valuable book. It is simply, 
almost ingenuously written. . . Outlines all the difficulties and privi- 
leges of the different stages in a soldier's development. . . In fact, 
from every aspect, light, serious, deeply human and sincerely religious, 
every American soldier will be helped by reading Lieutenant MacQuar- 
rie's book." 

Army and Navy Register: "Intended for the guidance of the man 
who is going to France. . . The author handles matters frankly and 
helpfully. He writes in a human, wholehearted manner of how upon 
the battlefield a man's character can be made or destroyed. The 
general reader will read it and gain insight; the young soldier will 
find it a source of inspiration and instruction." 

New York Sun: "Lieutenant MacQuarrie tells the American boys 
what they are to expect when they get on the other side, opening 
their eyes to discomforts and perils of all sorts, which they can 
avoid if they wish. . . A masterpiece, a straight-from-the-shoulder 
talk that is neither goody nor medical, but such as men who are in 
earnest use among themselves. . . If any book can make up for the 
lack of personal experience in essential matters this little volume can."

6 illustrations. $1.50 net. 

The author, a doctor and patient, has become increasingly con- 
vinced that the great number of deaths occur, not because the 
disease is terribly virulent, but simply because the majority of 
patients do not understand the reasons underlying the only treat- 
ment that will bring success. This book is written in the hope of 
setting forth in a simple, interesting, and convincing manner the 
fundamental facts which help to answer the patient's constant "Why 
must I do this?"

The War and the Bagdad Railway 

A Story of Asia Minor and Its Relation to the Present Conflict. 
By MORRIS JASTROW, Jr., Ph.D., LL.D. 

15 illustrations and a map. $1.50 net. 

This is a different kind of war book but one of the utmost im- 
portance. Everyone has heard of the Bagdad Railway but few 
realize its true relation to the present conflict. To do so is to gain 
a valuable insight into the course of history. This subject has not 
been covered in the war literature of the day. Professor Jastrow 
tells the story of the Railway from its inception. He shows why and 
how it became a political scheme of the first magnitude. The story 
of the Bagdad Highway is romantic and fascinating. The possession 
of it has always determined the fate of the East. Europe is fighting 
for its possession today just as the Persians, Romans, Greeks, Arabs 
and Turks fought for it in the past. To understand its importance 
and the relation it bears to our civilization is to understand one of 
the underlying causes of the war and one to which the utmost con- 
sideration must be given at the Peace Settlement. Professor Jastrow 
understands the subject thoroughly. His life work _has been the 
study of the East and his publications have given _him a standing 
as an authority on Eastern civilization. His prophetic look into the 
future will be of intense interest to serious students of the problems 
of the war. The carefully selected illustrations are a feature, as is 
also the comprehensive map of Asia Minor, etc., in which both the 
ancient and modern names of all important places are indicated.

E,L SUPREMO 

EDWARD LUCAS WHITE'S 

Romantic Historical Novel About Dr. Francia, the Famous 
Dictator of Paraguay. Weaves a New Bond of Interest 

Between North and South America Net $1.90 

Its graphic, charming pictures of life in sunlit Asuncion 100 years ago exactly true in all their 
colorful details transport the reader to 

A New and Fascinating Land of Romance 

different from anything he has ever read before, fresh, picturesque, delightful. Its story, full of plots 
and counterplots, political intrigues, revolutionary scheming, social entanglements, romantic episodes, 
holds him absorbed from first page to last. 

The New England adventurer, William Hawthorne, who goes to Paraguay ostensibly to promote the 
export of mate, or Paraguayan tea, but secretly for the purpose of overthrowing the iron-handed El 
Supremo, is at once swept into plots and mysteries and dramatic events, into the gay social life of 
the aristocracy and the miseries of the poor, even into intimate friendship with the Dictator himself. 

The novel has been compared by leading literary critics with George Eliot's "Romola," with Conrad's 
"Nostromo," with Winston Churchill's "Richard Carvel," with Kipling s "Kim," with Conan Doyle's "The 
White Company," with Blackmore's "Lorna Doone." Here are in brief some of their judgments upon it: 

"The Big Book of the Year." 
"Pages of Enchantment." 

"A Fine and Splendid Picture." 
Rare and fortunate is the novel that wins from critics such unanimous approval and such varied praise 
as the critical journals of America have given to "El Supremo." 



"It Comes Alive Under Our Eyes." 
"It Enriches Our Literature." 
"A Rare Kind of Novel." 



The Nation in a full page review said: " 4 E1 
Supremo' is fiction upon the heroic scale and in 
something very like the grand manner. . . . 
The remarkable thing about this book is that 
with all its meticulousness of detail, with all its 
shifting kaleidoscope of scenes and incidents 
. . . it does achieve the miracle; it comes alive 
under our eyes, glows _ with life and color, shows 
the true depth and richness of heroic romance. 
. . . We are fain to submit the impressions 
of a powerful work of the imagination, a work 
of genius." 

The New York Tribune declared that "This is 
indeed _ a remarkable piece of work, picturesque 
as fiction and no less colorful as a page of prac- 
tically unknown American history, called the 
atmosphere "enchanting," said that romance 
blooms everywhere under the eyes of parents and 
duennas, summed up the story as "a vivid, com- 
prehensive picture of a period and a life gone 
beyond recall," and was sure that "it will nold 
the attention of all who venture into the en- 
chantment of its opening pages." 



The Chicago Daily News in the course of a 
third review recanted entirely a doubting opinion 
expressed in its first article: "'El Supremo is a 
royal character; he needs room to rove in. If 
Mr. White could not confine him to the one 
dimension of a short story, neither could we, nor 
do we wish it. And we prophesy soberly that 
our grandchildren will agree with us." 

The Dial, reviewing the novel at length and 
with hearty admiration, said that "the author 
possesses a remarkable historical imagination and 
the book lives, and we live with it. 

The New York Evening Poet in a long and 
appreciative review said: "The book may fairly 
be described as extraordinary. For Mr. Wnite has 
attempted the impossible and has almost achieved 
it. The amazing thing is that presenting this 
immense and bewildering kaleidoscope Mr. White is 
able to give to his picture sweep and expanse, 
and at the same time to fill in the details so 
that it is aglow with life and color." 



But it is impossible to quote briefly from all the laudatory comment the book has received. The 
opinions above prove that the best literary judgment of this country agrees with the publishers of this 
novel, that it is without doubt the Greatest American Historical Romance that has yet appeared. And 
certainly it would be difficult to find anywhere a more enchanting and exciting tale than this in which 
the reader lives, fascinated to the end, the life of gay and bright Asuncion under the rule of "El Su- 
premo."

A Suggestion to Congress 



WE were sitting in the smoking compartment of a 
Pullman, hitched to a broken down, coughy 
engine that was jerking its way along the un- 
even tracks that parallelled the St. Croiz River. I had 
been up the Grand Lake Streams for a few weeks' loaf, 
fishing, smoking, reading, thinking. As the engine 
labored along, the bleak, stubby remains of fine spruce 
forests on one side of it and the turgid, little river full 
of pulp wood on the other, I half closed my eyes and 
dreamily played a monstrous trout on a gossamer line. 
Just as I was about to land ray catch, the chap sitting 
opposite me remarked in the same matter of fact tone 
in which he might have said Good Evening! "How 
can they do it for sixty cents!" He seemed perfectly 
sane, his gray eyes were steady and calm, so my first 
impulse to plead an engagement developed into the 
conventional "I beg your pardon ?" Preston continued, 
"When I answered their first advertisement in The 
New Republic, I cheerfully anticipated getting sixty 
cents' worth, if that some cheap, abridged, poorly 
edited book printed in eye-straining type on butcher's 
manila. But when those two books came! Just think 
a 350 page copy of "Thus Spake Zarathustra" I 
had tried for months to get that last word of "Kultur" 
translated by Thomas Common and with an intro- 
duction by Frau Nietzsche, and a volume of the finest 
collection of 13 De Maupassant stories I've ever seen, 
and I think I know my De Maupassant. I felt that I 
had cheated the publishers." Preston paused for breath 
I learned afterwards that he is an unusually taciturn 
man and before he could resume, I had opened my 
bag and fished out two charming limp croft leather 
volumes, "The Way of All Flesh" and "The Mayor of 
Casterbridge" with Joyce Kilmer's introduction. 

"I thought you were a bit queer, at first," I said, 
"but they say people are judged by the books they 
read, so we don't need any other introduction." 

"I should say not," Preston exclaimed, "collectors of 
the Modern Library don't. Aren't they the most satis- 
fying companion volumes ever?" 

Just then the crazy engine grunted and pulled up at 
Machias Junction, where Preston and I got out, 
stretched our legs and passed the time of night with a 
group of State of Maine lumber jacks. Preston told 
them the yarn about Isaac Newton cutting a big hole 
and a small hole in the side of his barn so that both his 
big cat and her kittens could get out at night, and we 
could hear their appreciative guffaws as we settled 
down again to our pipes and our chat. 

I told Preston a lot about the Modern Library that 
he didn't know. He had gotten only the first twelve 
titles. He let his pipe go out several times when I told 
him there were thirty volumes to be had for the same 
sixty cent price and that almost every one of the new 
titles had an introduction by such men as Padraic 
Colum, Alexander Harvey, Willard Huntington 
Wright, etc., which some people thought alone worth 
the sixty cents. 

I waxed eloquent and, before we thought of turning 
in for the night, had explained how The Modern 
Library had started with the idea of giving the Ameri- 
can Public the very best in modern thought at as low 
a price as possible, and in a simple, attractive, con- 
venient form. It included books that had never been 
published in this country before, such as "Married" and 
"A Miracle of St. Antony"; and out of print books; 
that it bought from other publishers the right to reprint 
such worth-while books of contemporaneous interest 



"Best sellers don't mean entree to The Modern 
Library," I said, "though 'The Best Russian Stories' 
and 'The Way of All Flesh' and 'Dorian Gray' and 
several others have been reprinted several times in 
this edition" 

"Do you realize," said Preston, "that those fellows 
are doing something big? Only one or two foreign 
publishers have attempted anything as fine as that 
Modern Library" 

"That's just what Gerould of The Bellman, William 
Marion Reedy and Mencken and Kerfoot and all the 
critics are saying," I answered. "Clifford Smyth of 
the New York Times, and he knows books, says: 

" 'If real merit in typography, binding, convenience, 
and best of all subject matter, counts for anything, 
these books are certainly deserving of a fine measure 
of success. They fill a need that is not quite covered, 
so far as I have observed, by any other publication in 
the field just now.'" 

Preston exclaimed, "Great heavens, man, I'm a 
Modern Library fan myself, but you seem to remem- 
ber word for word what people say about it. They 
ought to have you on their pay roll." "Well to tell you 
the truth, they have," I replied with somewhat of a 
sheepish grin, "in fact I'm one of the publishers of the 
Modern Library. I wouldn't have started talking 
about it if you hadn't wound me up, so you'll have to 
excuse me, and " 

"Excuse you nothing," said Preston, "there ought to 
be an Act of Congress obliging everyone to read The 
Modern Library. I'll call it square, though, if you give 
me one of your new lists, and have breakfast with me 
at the Parker House in the morning." 

So we shook hands and a few minutes later, as I 
pulled the tan colored blanket over my legs, the poor 
old spavined engine gave an extra cough or two, and 
the last that I remember of that night is the vision of 
a gigantic trout, reading "The Red Lily" in a barn 
with two cats. Here is the list Boni gave Preston:

The Case of the Professor and the Public Interest 



Newspaper comment on late academic 
events at the University of Minnesota and 
Columbia University reveals even more 
clearly than usual the split between the 
prevailing attitude inside and outside of 
university walls. To the general public 
practically every academic issue which gets 
upon the "front page" is one of freedom 
of teaching and speech. Reactions are 
condemnatory of administrative action if 
the editorial writer or the voluntary cor- 
respondent feels that there is danger of 
inquiry and discussion being stifled, espe- 
cially if a vivid imagination sees universi- 
ties being choked to death in the grip of 
capitalistic overlords. They are laudatory 
on equally general principles if the writer 
feels that teachers in universities are run- 
ning amuck with political and theological 
radicalism, or even are trying to enlighten 
their students as to the drift of modern 
radical thought instead of confining them- 
selves to inculcating well-established or- 
thodoxies of interpretation. Show me one 
who, as Elihu Root said so naively about 
suffrage for women, "looked into the mat- 
ter a great many years ago" and came to 
a conclusion which he has never found 
reason for reopening, and I will show you 
one who deprecates the tendencies of pro- 
fessors to adopt half-baked opinions and 
who rejoices at every curb placed by the 
firm hand of authority upon irresponsible 
licentiousness of thought. See, passim, 
the editorial columns of the "New York 
Times." 

Strangely enough, by contrast, one 
rarely finds the body of college teachers 
much excited about the free-speech issue. 
What it is concerned about is usually ques- 
tions of procedure, which ultimately turn 
upon the relative authority to be exercised 
by the trustees as legal employers and 
guardians and the faculty as representing 
immediate educational interests. The case 
of the faculty has never been better stated 
than by President Schurman of Cornell 



apropos of the resignation of Professor 
Beard. Consequently I make no apology 
for quoting him at length, especially as his 
official position protects his account from 
the charge of being an expression of un- 
bridled professorial license. 

The American professor is apt to chafe at being 
under a board of trustees, which in his most critical 
moods he feels to be alien to the republic of science 
and letters. Even in his kindliest moods he cannot 
think that board representative of the university. 
The university is an intellectual organization and 
the American professor wants the government of the 
university to conform to that essential fact. His 
indictment of the existing form of government is 
that it sets up and maintains an alien ideal, the 
ideal of a business corporation engaging professors 
as employees and controlling them by means of an 
absolute and irresponsible authority. 

The professor's attitude is not so sen- 
sational as that of the public. It is less 
heroic than that of popular radicalism, 
which demands the thrill of combat, the 
plot of the oppressing villain and the mar- 
tyrdom of the oppressed victim. It turns 
largely on formal and technical questions, 
questions of procedure as may be seen in 
the report of the Association of American 
Professors on the case of Scott Nearing 
at the University of Pennsylvania. There 
is a popular image of the association rush- 
ing to his rescue out of sympathy with 
radical views. As a matter of fact, the 
condemnation of the Pennsylvania author- 
ities was based essentially upon prosaic 
details of failure to define grounds, failure 
to allow a hearing, upon details of time 
and method of dismissal, with present- 
ment of collateral evidence that these ir- 
regularities of procedure were due to 
unacknowledged objections to the tenor of 
his economic doctrines. This case affords 
a reasonably fair symbol of the usual situ- 
ation. 

It is obvious that the professorial atti- 
tude is not one of itself to attain the dig- 
nity of the front page. It is too technical, 
not sufficiently dramatic and personal. It 
even readily lends itself to adverse and

THE DIAL 



[November 8 



unsympathetic statement. The professors 
are represented as animated by a narrow 
class spirit, bound together to protect one 
another at all hazards, and setting them- 
selves up as above the ordinary rules of 
responsibility to their superiors that is, 
their employers. Sympathies that might 
easily be gained by the war cry of infringe- 
ment of freedom of thought and teaching 
are dissipated or alienated when the case 
is rested so largely on formal grounds, 
when the struggle is revealed to be one for 



greater participation in university govern- 
ment. It may then be worth while to set 
forth the grounds on which teachers 
appeal for the sympathy and support of 
the public in what can readily be construed 
into a struggle for mere class privileges. 

President Schurman stated the gist of 
the thing when he said that to the teacher 
the university is "an intellectual organiza- 
tion," and that he wants the actual govern- 
ment of the university to conform to this 
fundamental fact. If anything lifts the 
effort of the teaching body from an 
attempt to advance personal and class pre- 
rogatives up to that of a public interest, 
it is, of course, just this fact. If security 
and responsibility of intellectual organi- 
zation are worth anything to the nation, 
then the professors' efforts to get a respon- 
sible share in college control form a public 
service. If guarantees of the indepen- 
dence of the higher intellectual life of the 
nation from alien and sinister influences 
are worth anything to contemporary 
America, then professors are entitled to 
every meed of public support in their bat- 
tle against a situation which in the lan- 
guage of Professor Beard makes the 
status of the college teacher "lower than 
that of the manual laborer who, through 
his union, has at least some voice in the 
terms and conditions of his employment." 
For until this voice can be obtained, the 
calling of promotion of intelligence in 
the nation remains unassured, precarious, 
imperfectly responsible. 

The case of the university teacher is 
simple. It is that the teaching body rep- 
resents and embodies that function of 
scholarship and research which is the 
essential life of the university, while law 
and precedent, surviving from a day when 
economic and intellectual conditions were 



radically different from those of the pres- 
ent, confer control upon a body of men 
"alien to the republic of science and let- 
ters." He is only too well aware of the 
fact that legally the trustees (as in the 
words of the charter of Columbia Univer- 
sity) "shall forever hereafter have full 
power and authority to direct the course 
of study and the discipline to be 
observed," and that he holds his position 
purely at "the pleasure of the trustees." 
But he is also aware that these documents 
reflect the conditions of a century ago, 
when the modern university was as 
undreamed of on one side, as the modern 
big business corporation on the other. 
And when he is told that since he knew 
the conditions of his employment when he 
accepted his job, he is thereby estopped 
from complaint, his answer is not merely 
that trustees are far too wise to attempt 
to base their course consistently upon their 
legal authority, but also that his primary 
loyalty is to an idea, to a function and 
calling, to the advancement of learning 
and truth, and that it is his business as 
well as his right to struggle by every legiti- 
mate means to bring about a change in any 
situation which compromises the efficacy 
of his public calling. 

Nothing is more desirable than that the 
change should come about by a voluntary 
devolution of authority on the part of 
its legal possessors. But events demon- 
strate that the past policy of holding, for 
the most part, these powers in tacit abey- 
ance is rapidly becoming one of unstable 
equilibrium, and that the situation must be 
defined and clarified by an explicit con- 
ferring of authority upon the teaching 
body. If wisdom is lacking in high places 
to effect the change by voluntary abdica- 
tion, then the question which the teaching 
body will have to face is how far it is will- 
ing to become a body of place-holders and 
technical specialists immune from interfer- 
ence because it speaks in tongues not 
understood by the public. I have written 
of the question as it affects the college 
teacher because I am familiar with the 
question from that angle. But the issue 
affects the entire teaching body of all our 
schools. The spread of the movement to 
federate public-school teachers with trade-

unions cannot be understood except as a 
part of this larger issue. That portion of 
the public which deplores the fact that 
teachers resort to industrial unions for 
defence and support assumes, beyond all 
others, an obligation to recognize the 
concern of the public in the struggle of 
teachers to have a more responsible voice 
in the conduct of their work. In the end, 



it is the public, not the teachers nor their 
legal employers and regulators, whether in 
the university or in other schools, which 
will determine the settlement of the issue. 
It is not too much to say that the final issue 
is how much the American people cares 
about the integrity and responsibility of 
the intellectual life of the nation.

An Apology for Crudity 



For a long time I have believed that 
crudity is an inevitable quality in the 
production of a really significant present- 
day American literature. How indeed is 
one to escape the obvious fact that there 
is as yet no native subtlety of thought or 
living among us? And if we are a crude 
and childlike people how can our litera- 
ture hope to escape the influence of that 
fact? Why indeed should we want it to 
escape? 

If you are in doubt as to the crudity of 
thought in America, try an experiment. 
Come out of your offices, where you sit 
writing and thinking, and try living with 
us. Get on a train at Pittsburg and go 
west to the mountains of Colorado. Stop 
for a time in our towns and cities. Stay 
for a week in some Iowa corn-shipping 
town and for another week in one of the 
Chicago clubs. As you loiter about read 
our newspapers and listen to our conversa- 
tions, remembering, if you will, that as 
you see us in the towns and cities, so we 
are. We are not subtle enough to con- 
ceal ourselves and he who runs with open 
eyes through the Mississippi Valley may 
read the story of the Mississippi Valley. 

It is a marvelous story and we have 
not yet begun to tell the half of it. A 
little, I think I know why. It is because 
we who write have drawn ourselves away. 
We have not had faith in our people and 
in the story of our people. If we are 
crude and childlike, that is our story and 
our writing men must learn to dare to 
come among us until they know the story. 
The telling of the story depends, I be- 
lieve, upon their learning that lesson and 
accepting that burden. 



To my room, which is on a street near 
the loop in the city of Chicago, come men 
who write. They talk and I talk. We 
are fools. We talk of writers of the old 
world and the beauty and subtlety of the 
work they do. Below us the roaring city 
lies like a great animal on the prairies, 
but we do not run out to the prairies. We 
stay in our rooms and talk. 

And so, having listened to talk and 
having myself talked overmuch, I grow 
weary of talk and walk in the streets. As 
I walk alone, an old truth comes home to 
me and I know that we shall never have 
an American literature until we return to 
faith in ourselves and to the facing of 
our own limitations. We must, in some 
way, become in ourselves more like our 
fellows, more simple and real. 

For surely it does not follow that be- 
cause we Americans are a people without 
subtlety, we are a dull or uninteresting 
people. Our literature is dull, but we 
are not. One remembers how Dostoevsky 
had faith in the simplicity of the Rus- 
sians and what he achieved. He lived 
and he expressed the life of his time and 
people. The thing that he did brings 
hope of achievement for our men. 

But let us first of all accept certain 
truths. Why should we Americans 
aspire to a subtlety that belongs not to 
us but to old lands and places? Why 
talk of intellectuality and of intellectual 
life when we have not accepted the life 
that we have? There is death on that 
road and following it has brought death 
into much of American writing. Can you 
doubt what I say? Consider the smooth 
slickness of the average magazine story. 



438 



THE DIAL 



[November 8 



There is often great subtlety of plot and 
phrase, but there is no reality. Can such 
work live? The answer is that the most 
popular magazine story or novel does not 
live in our minds for a month. 

And what are we to do about it? To 
me it seems that as writers we shall have 
to throw ourselves with greater daring 
into the life here. We shall have to begin 
to write out of the people and not for the 
people. We shall have to find within our- 
selves a little of that courage. To con- 
tinue along the road we are travelling is 
unthinkable. To draw ourselves apart, 
to live in little groups and console our- 
selves with the thought that we are achiev- 
ing intellectuality, is to get nowhere. By 
such a road we can hope only to go on 
producing a literature that has nothing to 
do with life as it is lived in these United 
States. 

To be sure, the doing of the thing I 
am talking about will not be easy. Amer- 
ica is a land of objective writing and 
thinking. New paths will have to be 
made. The subjective impulse is almost 
unknown to us. Because it is close to 
life, it works out into crude and broken 
forms. It leads along a road that such 
American masters of prose as James and 
Howells did not want to take, but if we 
are to get anywhere, we shall have to 
travel that road. 

The road is rough and the times are 
pitiless. Who, knowing our America and 
understanding the life in our towns and 
cities, can close his eyes to the fact that 
life here is for the most part an ugly 
affair? As a people we have given our- 
selves to industrialism, and industrialism is 
not lovely. If anyone can find beauty in 
an American factory town, I wish he would 
show me the way. For myself, I cannot 
find it. To me, and I am living in in- 
dustrial life, the whole thing is as ugly 
as modern war. I have to accept that 
fact and I believe a great step forward 
will have been taken when it is more gen- 
erally accepted. 

But why, I am asked, is crudity and 
ugliness necessary? Why cannot a man 
like Mr. Dreiser write in the spirit of 
the early Americans, why cannot he see 
fun in life? What we want is the note of 
health. In the work of Mark Twain 



there was something wholesome and 
sweet. Why cannot the modern man be 
also wholesome and sweet? 

To this I make answer that to me a 
man, say like Mr. Dreiser, is wholesome. 
He is true to something in the life about 
him, and truth is always wholesome. 
Twain and Whitman wrote out of an- 
other age, out of an age and a land of 
forests and rivers. The dominant note 
of American life in their time was the 
noisy, swaggering raftsman and the hairy- 
breasted woodsman. To-day it is not so. 
The dominant note in American life to- 
day is the factory hand. When we have 
digested that fact, we can begin to ap- 
proach the task of the present-day novel- 
ist with a new point of view. 

It is, I believe, self-evident that the 
work of the novelist must always lie some- 
what outside the field of philosophic 
thought. Your true novelist is a man gone 
a little mad with the life of his times. As 
he goes through life he lives, not in him- 
self, but in many people. Through his 
brain march figures and groups of figures. 
Out of the many figures, one emerges. If 
he be at all sensitive to the life about him 
and that life be crude, the figure that 
emerges will be crude and will crudely 
express itself. 

I do not know how far a man may go 
on the road of subjective writing. The 
matter, I admit, puzzles me. There is 
something approaching insanity in the 
very idea of sinking yourself too deeply 
into modern American industrial life. 

But it is my contention that there is no 
other road. If one would avoid neat, 
slick writing, he must at least attempt to 
be brother to his brothers and live as the 
men of his time live. He must share with 
them the crude expression of their lives. 
To our grandchildren the privilege of at- 
tempting to produce o school of American 
writing that has delicacy and color may 
come as a matter of course. One hopes that 
will be true, but it is not true now. And 
that is why, with so many of the younger 
Americans, I put my faith in the modern 
literary adventurers. We shall, I am sure, 
have much crude, blundering American 
writing before the gift of beauty and 
subtlety in prose shall honestly belong 
to us. SHERWOOD ANDERSON.

The Structure of Lasting 'Peace 
II 

THE "PRINCIPLE OF NATIONALITY": "NATURAL 

RIGHTS" AND THE EVOCATION OF 

NATIONALITY 

That nationality is a principle is a dis- 
covery comparatively recent. Its appro- 
priation by dynasts, by hereditary and 
military oligarchs, and by traders, priests, 
and politicians is little more recent. 
Nationality was a fact before it became a 
principle, and it was an unrecognized con- 
dition before it became a fact. Before 
nations were, there were dynasties or 
states, that is, associations of men and 
women working out their lives generation 
after generation in service and obedience 
to masters whose claim rested on force, 
tradition, and superstition. Who, particu- 
larly, these masters were, that exploited 
their persons and property, was a matter 
of indifference to the masses of Christian 
Europe throughout the greater part of 
Europe's history. And even more indif- 
ferent was it to the classes, whom they 
exploited. Lands and people changed 
owners as the toll of successful military 
piracy or as marriage portions, and the 
changes were regarded as part of the 
necessity that is resident in the nature of 
things. And necessity, as everybody nowa- 
days has been assured, knows no law. 

Nevertheless, this necessity began, on 
the whole and in the long run, to get abro- 
gated. Its power of constituting the 
nature of things began to fail. The nature 
of things was altering, and the force bring- 
ing about the miraculous alteration was 
the force of nationality. Nationality 
itself, however, is no miracle, no artefact. 
It also is an aspect and constituent of the 
nature of things, long merely implicit and 
asleep, awakened by democracy to power 
and to efficacy. The awakening was slow 
and indirect. Remote beginnings accrue 
to it from the religious reformation which 
removed the seat of religious authority 
from the head of a church to the heart of 
each member of the church; a nearer cause 
was removal of the seat of sovereignty 
from the head of the state to the citizenry 
of the state, the Puritan Revolution accom- 



plishing this in fact by the trial and execu- 
tion of the Cavalier king, proving thereby 
that the divinity which hedges about a king 
makes him none the less amenable to the 
laws of men, when men choose to assert 
themselves. The act was defended by 
opposing to the doctrine of the "divine 
right of kings" the doctrine of the natural 
rights of man, and when the French Revo- 
lution, a century and more later, repeated 
the act, the doctrine had become common- 
place. Our Declaration of Independence 
pronounces its essence: God had created 
all men equal and had endowed them "with 
certain inalienable rights." These, as 
against the dynastic privilege, had come to 
be taken as the necessity immanent in the 
nature of things. Necessarily, hence, the 
inequalities among men of class, of sta- 
tion, of privilege, of right, of property, of 
virtue were contrary to the nature of 
things, artifices, inventions of priests and 
kings to perpetuate their rule. According 
to natural law and natural right all men 
are alike and all men are good; abolish 
class and privilege and you automatically 
abolish injustice and evil. So argued 
Rousseau, so all the eighteenth-century 
prophets of natural right. "You are as 
good as your betters, and your betters are 
no better than they should be. Sovereignty 
is everybody's and everybody is equal." 

This teaching, though it may contradict 
the facts of life, is so near to the hopes of 
men, that men took it at once to heart. 
The Polish shlakta, whose indifference to 
the common good had made Poland the 
easy victim of the Prussian conspiracy 
against her, learned to think of the whole 
of Poland, peasantry, customs, and institu- 
tions, as the peer of her destroyers. The 
British colonies of North America effected 
their momentous revolution. The masses 
of France brought theirs to its epoch- 
making culmination. Under the inspira- 
tion of the democratic idea societies of men 
were acting collectively, autonomously, 
and with full consciousness of what they 
were doing, against dynasty, property, and 
authority, and all that these imply in 
ownership and command. The beneficiar- 
ies of these took natural alarm. Prussia, 
Austria, Russia, England also, combined 
against the people of France. But only to

find that their armies melted away, that 
their subjects everywhere celebrated the 
coming of the French soldier as the coming 
of the liberator. The republican form of 
government followed the French army in 
fact, as trade follows the flag in military- 
capitalistic fancy. Dynasts, anxious to 
maintain their prestige, found themselves 
compelled to defer to the free good-will of 
their subjects. Continental state-organiza- 
tion appeared to be getting turned 
down-side up. The people were in fact 
becoming the sovereign. 

That is, they were becoming conscious, 
in trying to respond to the call of the revo- 
lution, of what nature and habit and hope 
they and their neighbors were, and of how 
these were expressed in language and 
tradition, in memory and custom, in all 
that makes up a community's cycle of life. 
The revolutionary call to Equality meant, 
for the daily life, the abolition of all the 
caste and property distinctions that the 
Russians have discarded to-day. The 
Revolution's call to Fraternity meant, for 
the daily life, comradeship on an equal 
basis with anyone with whom communica- 
tion could be effectively held with the 
neighbor, that is, near at hand, who speaks 
the same language and has the same back- 
ground, who, by virtue of this sameness, 
understands. The Revolution's call to 
Liberty meant, first and foremost, the 
overthrow of the traditional oppressor at 
home, and the achievement there of self- 
government, the replacing of dynasty by 
commonwealth. 

Had the new French nation continued 
to treat the peoples its armies set free as 
peers, as fellow-citizens, not as subjects; 
had Napoleon not once more restored 
piratical imperialism to the place from 
which the ideas of the Revolution had 
driven it, the ruling caste of Europe could 
never have succeeded in duping their sub- 
jects into believing in the identity of their 
interests and the community of their cause. 
Even so, their success depended on a con- 
cession to the principle that sovereignty 
rests in the people. For the call to resist 
Napoleon had to be made through an 
appeal to self-appreciation, through a 
propaganda, sometimes inspired, some- 
times spontaneous, exhorting the various 



peoples of Europe to consider the excel- 
lence and dignity of their ancestries, their 
cults, their traditions, their histories, their 
ways of living, their arts, and particularly 
their languages. The most conspicuous 
continental instance of such a propaganda 
is the series of "Addresses to the German 
People" by the philosopher Fichte. 

The outcome of this movement of ideas 
and events was nationality. As the doctrine 
that the people is the sovereign spread, it 
made them conscious of the quality of their 
life, their memories, and their institutions 
wherein consists their unity as a people. 
The need of resistance to a common 
foe deepened the sense of this unity, and 
rendered the elements which are its form 
objects more precious to be preserved 
than life itself. Among these elements a 
sovereign government is not to be found: 
a nationality is not a state, and may exist 
without any political individuality what- 
ever, as do the Scotch and Welsh and Irish 
nationalities in England, or the Italian 
and French and German in Switzerland, 
or the Bohemian, Croat, Czech, and Serb- 
ian in Austria-Hungary, or the Ukrain- 
ian or Polish or Finnish in Russia, or the 
Jewish there and everywhere. A single 
nationality may be distributed among many 
states, as are the Jews and the Poles; 
many nationalities may compose one state, 
as Great Britain is composed, or Turkey, 
or Austria-Hungary. Nor, again, is a 
nationality a nation, for a nation is a 
nationality possessed of political sover- 
eignty and animated by political purposes 
with regard to other nations, which it is 
free to carry out. Hungary is a nation; 
Bohemia is not; Austria-Hungary is not. 
England is a nation; Ireland is not. Ger- 
many is a nation; Bavaria and Prussia are 
not. France and Italy are nations; Rus- 
sia is not. All are nationalities, plural or 
singular. States exist wherever govern- 
ment controls nationalities for its own pur- 
poses without regard to the will and 
preference of the nationalities. Nations ex- 
ist where the purposes of government are 
the expression and execution of the will of 
the people. Nationality is the basis and 
material of both states and nations. It 
exists potentially wherever human beings 
are associated in durable groups, through

Garden Dream 

They cried before my gate at morning-mirth, 
"Come out and help us burn the weeds from 
earth!" 

But I was planting out my garden-close 
With wands of lily and with slips of rose, 
And their scented wavings made the air so sweet 
That I could not listen to their trampling 

feet. . . 

(Yet there blew a perfume from the garden-bed 
That changed the evil weeds to white and red!) 

They cried before my gate at noontide-breath, 
"Come out help us hush the dance of death!" 

But I was dancing in a woodland ring 
With brown wood-women for my partnering, 
And fauns that fluted till the green glades rang, 
And all I heard was what the wood-birds 

sang. . . 
(Yet there came a music from the wood-folk's 

flute 
That made the drums of evil dancing mute!) 

They cried before my gate at sweet of night, 
"Come out and help us scourge the black world 
white!" 

But I was weaving me a golden gown 
All strung with silver ribbons up and down, 
With moon-white laces that should foam and fall, 
And I could not hear their lashing words at 
all. . . 

(Yet there streamed a light from out my golden 

gown 

That cleansed the blackness of each evil town!) 

\ 

And every poor man had a garden-close 
With wands of lilies and with slips of rose, 
And every poor child danced the woodlands 

through 

And sang and fluted merry songs he knew, 
And every woman had a golden gown 
Gay-strung with silver ribbons up and down, 
And we all went singing how the world is fair 
And warm the summer light and glad the air!

Literary Affairs in France 

(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 
One of the wittiest Parisian papers, "GEuvre," 
said this morning that readers of newspapers who 
took the trouble to go right to the end of their 
papers yesterday would have found a British vic- 
tory on the last page. This exactly hits off the 
position to which the military operations are now 
relegated in public opinion and in the press. No- 
body thinks or talks of anything but the latest 
scandals; the Bolo affair, the Turmel affair, the 
Almereyda-Duval affair fill most of the small 
space to which the newspapers are reduced by the 
paper famine. 

Of all the present "affairs," that in which M. 
Paul Bolo is concerned is by far the most im- 
portant, both as regards the sums of money in- 
volved and the position of the newspapers and 
the individuals more or less compromised. The 
"Bonnet Rouge," which is involved in the Al- 
mereyda-Duval case, was (it is at present sus- 
pended) an evening paper with a very small 
circulation and no influence. Almereyda, its ed- 
itor, who died in prison soon after his arrest, in 
circumstances not yet cleared up and never likely 
to be, was an adventurer almost worthy of Bal- 
zac, who had few scruples but against whom 
there was not the smallest evidence of treason. 
The charge against him was the merely technical 
one only possible on account of the existence of 
martial law of "detaining documents interest- 
ing the national defence," a charge which could 
be successfully brought against every newspaper- 
editor in Paris. Duval, who was the manager 
of the paper, in which he had invested rather 
less than $40,000, is accused of having had rela- 
tions with the enemy, but on account of the 
secrecy with which French judicial investigations 
are conducted, it is impossible as yet to say what 
evidence there is for the charge. The smallness 
of the sums with which he dealt is in itself a 
reason for doubting whether he was really an 
agent of Germany; it may turn out that it is 
merely a case of trading with the enemy. It is 
assumed that he gave money to the "Bonnet 
Rouge" to promote "pacifist" propaganda, but 
there was little evidence of such propaganda in 
the paper; indeed, the existence of the censorship 
would make it impossible for any French paper 
to demand peace at any price. Almereyda, in 
the course of his chequered career, had been a 
revolutionary anarchist, but from the beginning 
of the war his paper received a subsidy of $1600

a month from the government, a circumstance 
which led him greatly to modify his opinions. 

The chief interest of the Turmel affair is to 
be found in the fact that M. Turmel is a dep- 
uty. At present all that is known is that the 
sum of $5000 in Swiss bank-notes was found in 
his cupboard at the Chamber of Deputies. But 
the possession of the bank-notes of a neutral 
country is not in itself a legal offence and, but 
for M. Tunnel's own inconsistent explanations, 
it is probable that nothing would ever have been 
heard of the matter. 

Bolo Pasha (he was given that title by the 
ex-khedive Abbas Hilmi) is in a very different 
case. It is officially announced that a large sum 
was paid to his account in certain American 
banks by the Dresdener Bank. He supplied last 
year more than $1,000,000 to M. Charles Hum- 
bert for the "Journal," he holds half the shares 
in the company that owns the "Rappel," and 
among other papers in which he has a financial 
interest are said to be the "Paris-Midi," the "Cri 
de Paris" (a satirical weekly), and "La Revue," 
of which M. Jean Finot is the editor. Bolo had 
a large circle of influential friends, including the 
President of the Republic and M. Monier, first 
president of the Court of Appeal and the second 
judicial functionary of France. The latter has 
been called upon by the government to account 
for his relations with Bolo before the Court of 
Cassation. Bolo's friendship with M. Poincare 
caused him to be entrusted with more than one 
official mission abroad and he travelled with a 
diplomatic passport. 

One of the most interesting circumstances in 
the case is that the papers financed by Bolo are 
all extremely jingo in politics. The "Journal" 
advocates war to the bitter end and has made 
a campaign for more "cannons and munitions"; 
the "Rappel" is the special organ of the party 
that demands the annexation to France of all 
the German territory on the left bank of the 
Rhine. If, therefore, M. Bolo's money in fact 
came from the German government, it is evi- 
dent that the latter desires to encourage the ex- 
tremists in France that demand the continuation 
of the war until the Allies are in a position to 
impose humiliating conditions that will perma- 
nently cripple Germany. This would be an 
intelligent policy on the part of the German gov- 
ernment, for those extremists and their organs 
in the press enable the government to persuade 
the German people that they are defending their 
very existence, and that the extravagant demands 



of the Allies are responsible for the continuance 
of the war. Two years ago the German gov- 
ernment had a translation made of several of M. 
Maurice Barres's articles in the "Echo de Paris" 
and circulated them throughout Germany; M. 
Barres also demanded the annexation of all the 
left bank of the Rhine and the annihilation of 
Germany. 

The new ministry the fifth since the war 
does not seem to be very popular either in Par- 
liament or in the country; but ministries that 
have a cool reception sometimes last longer than 
those received with enthusiasm. The prime min- 
ister M. Painleve is personally popular and has 
the advantage of being a new man, for he had 
never held office before 1915, but the composi- 
tion of his cabinet is criticized and it is generally 
considered to be too large and unwieldy. He 
himself, it is believed, would have preferred to 
form a ministry of the Left, but M. Poincare 
persuaded him to include such politicians as MM. 
Ribot, Barthou, and Doumer, who represent con- 
servative Republican opinion. For the first time 
since the war the government includes no Social- 
ist. The Socialist party is sharply divided on the 
question of ministerial participation ; what is 
known as the "minoritaire" section objects to it 
altogether and refused to take part in the nego- 
tiations with M. Painleve. The "majoritaire," 
or governmental, section would still agree to be 
represented in the government on certain condi- 
tions, but they objected on the one hand to the 
inclusion of MM. Ribot, Barthou, and Doumer 
and, on the other hand, they were not satisfied 
with the portfolios offered them by M. Painleve. 
M. Albert Thomas, in particular, would accept 
no office but the ministry of foreign affairs or 
that of war, whereas M. Painleve asked him to 
remain at the ministry of armaments. 

The whole question of ministerial participa- 
tion, so far as the Socialist party is concerned, 
will be decided at the national congress of the 
party, which is to meet at Bordeaux on October 
6. The question of peace negotiations will also 
be discussed at the congress; the "minoritaires" 
have drawn up a resolution in favor of such 
negotiations at the earliest possible moment, in- 
deed the terms of the resolution suggest that, in 
their opinion, the moment has already arrived. 
Until May the two sections of the party were 
divided also on the question of resuming inter- 
national relations, but that difference no longer 
exists; the party is now \innnimous in desiring 
to take part in the proposed Stockholm confer-

ence and both sections declare in their resolutions 
their intention to use every effort to obtain the 
passports for Stockholm which the late ministry 
refused to issue. 

Art has languished since the war; the younger 
artists are at the front or are among the host of 
killed, there has been a terrible loss of prom- 
ising talent, and their elders for the most part, 
not having the heart to work in their studios, 
have found occupation in connection with the 
war. There are exceptions : M. Maurice Favre, 
a sculptor of great attainments, has recently fin- 
ished a marble bust of Anatole France, remark- 
able alike for its qualities as a work of art and its 
success as a psychological study. He is now in 
Italy, where he is engaged on busts of Gabriele 
d'Annunzio and General Cadorna. The event 
of last month was the death of Degas. He had 
already passed out of active life, for on account 
of his failing eyesight, he had not touched a 
brush for thirteen or fourteen years; when he 
could no longer paint, he amused himself by mak- 
ing figures in wax of dancers, which he intended 
for cires-perdues, but I do not think that any 
reached the stage of bronze. For the last few 
months he had been confined to his room, but he 
suffered from nothing except old age and he grad- 
ually went out like a burned-down candle. The 
end came one night quite naturally and pain- 
lessly; as one of his relatives said to me, "he 
never saw death," of which he had an almost 
morbid dread. 

It can hardly be disputed that one of the 
greatest artists of the nineteenth century has dis- 
appeared. Degas is often called an "impression- 
ist," but the term as applied to him is inaccurate 
and he himself protested against the description. 
His technique was never that of the impression- 
ists properly so-called, although he took part in 
all their exhibitions from 1874 to 1886. He 
himself asserted, perhaps not quite seriously, that 
he was the artistic descendant of Ingres; his 
first master, Lamothe, for whom Degas had all 
his life an immense admiration, had been a pupil 
of Ingres. But, although Degas was, like In- 
gres, above all a master of line, and although 
his art was a natural development of the great 
French tradition, he broke loose at a very early 
age from the fetters of academic convention by 
which Ingres was hampered, and, in my opinion, 
was a far greater artist than his adopted ances- 
tor and that is saying much. He was influ- 
enced both by the great Italians (during the two 
years that he spent at Rome in early youth study- 



ing without a master, he did little else than copy 
them) and by the impressionists, and was inter- 
ested above all in light and movement. Pastel 
was the medium that he preferred to all others 
and, in my opinion, he was the greatest pastel- 
list that the world has yet known ; I dare to put 
him even above Perronneau and Latour. The 
French government, which has bought so many 
bad pictures, never purchased a work of Degas, 
he felt the slight deeply, but the Louvre has 
now a representative selection of some of his best 
paintings and pastels, thanks to the posthumous 
generosity of Count Isaac de Camondo. Degas 
has left no "school"; his only real pupil was an 
American, Miss Cassatt, but Toulouse-Lautrec, 
of course, owed much to his influence. 

I have left myself no space to speak of litera- 
ture, but there is not much to be said on that 
subject at present. The majority of books pub- 
lished are concerned with the war and few have 
much value. The great success of the year a 
success entirely deserved has been "Le Feu" of 
M. Henri Barbusse, a description of modern war 
as it really is by a man who has experienced it 
and, being an artist, is able to record his expe- 
riences in a work of great literary qualities. All 
the fighting men that I know agree that it is 
the only truthful book about the war. Its sale 
has been greater than that of the most successful 
works of Zola at the height of his fame in the 
same period; it has been translated into English 
("Under Fire," Dutton) and also, without the 
permission of its author, into German. Another 
book of a very different kind relating rather to 
the future peace than to the war itself is "Les 
Bases d'une Paix durable," by M. August 
Schvan (Paris; Alcan), of which an American 
edition is, I understand, shortly to be published. 
It is an extraordinarily original and independent 
contribution to the study of future international 
relations ; M. Schvan aims at getting rid of diplo- 
macy and foreign politics altogether and his solu- 
tion reduces enormously the functions of the 
state. It seems to me both promising and prac- 
ticable, given the will to put it into practice, but 
it is intensely revolutionary and makes hay of 
established conventions and traditions. 

The season has given us one really remarkable 
play, "Les Noces d'Argent," by M. Paul Ger- 
aldy, a young author who had the honor of 
getting this his first dramatic work produced at 
the Comedie Franchise; but I must defer any 
comment on it. RQBERT DELL

Tendencies in Modern American 
'Poetry 

TENDENCIES IN MODERN AMERICAN POETRY. By 
Amy Lowell. (The Macmillan Co.; $2.50.) 

Miss Lowell, who alternates actively between 
the creative and the excgctical, has paused in 
her poetry to write of a half-dozen of her 
American fellow-poets. Each of her studies 
carries with it not only a critical estimate of the 
subject's work, but also a sufficing amount of 
fresh biographical matter and a portrait not yet 
familiar to the public eye. 

Though the "new movement" has come chiefly 
within the past five years or so, Miss Lowell 
finds among her six selected poets representatives 
of three phases or stages; and this subdivision 
works advantageously to the architectonics of 
her volume. In her first stage Edwin Arlington 
Robinson and Robert Frost represent the earliest 
breaking down of tradition the slow fading of 
the fundamental beliefs upon which a particular 
civilization was reared, though the results of 
these beliefs still retain their hold upon the people 
brought up on them. The second stage is repre- 
sented by Edgar Lee Masters and, in some 
measure, by Carl Sandburg: beliefs are now 
so much a thing of the past that they have no 
power to mould character, and the result, for 
the moment, is a sort of mental chaos, tending 
to cynicism and even to despair. In the third 
stage the old beliefs have been left completely 
behind by new ones; men are living upon other 
planes of thought and are able to turn their 
attention to other things to Beauty, for ex- 
ample. This last and crowning stage is repre- 
sented to Miss Lowell by her fellow imagists, 
"H. D." and John Gould Fletcher. 

In the first stage, beauty is a thing remem- 
bered; it has still a haunting power. In the 
second, it is crowded out by the stress of travail 
by the birth pangs of the new. In the third, 
it is rediscovered, regained; and it is intoxicating: 
we are as like as not to find ourselves in the 
midst of "sea gardens," and "lacquered man- 
darin moments," and "vermilion pavilions," and 
"jade balustrades." 

It happens that three of these poets, one for 
each of Miss Lowell's stages, has written of 
Abraham Lincoln. She utilizes the three pro- 
ductions to drive her point home concretely. 
Thus, Robinson presents Lincoln as part man, 
part symbol, slightly conventionalized, and a 



little remote and cold: 

For he, to whom we had applied 
Our shopman's test of age and worth, 
Was elemental when he died, 
As he was ancient at his birth: 
The saddest among kings of earth, 
Bowed with a galling crown, this man 
Met rancor with a cryptic mirth, 
Laconic and Olympian. 

Masters makes Lincoln a man first of all, but 
a man typifying a national aspiration; yet, how- 
ever venerated and loved, always a man neither 
conventionalized by tradition nor lifted into the 
realm of legend. 

"Out of me," says Ann Rutledge 

The vibrations of deathless music ; 

''With malice toward none, with charity for all." 

Out of me the forgiveness of millions toward 

millions, 

And the beneficent face of a nation 
Shining with justice and truth. 

Fletcher raises Lincoln to the rank of "pure 
symbol, as elusive and pervading as a brooding 
god" raises him, indeed, "to the veiled awe of 
a national legend": 

There was a darkness in this man: an immense 

and hollow darkness, 
Of which we may not speak, nor share with 

him, nor enter. 

He whom we mocked and obeyed not, he whom 

we scorned and mistrusted, 
He has descended, like a god, to his rest. 

Strew over him flowers . . . rayed, violet, 
dim, 

With the nails that pierced, the cross that he 
bore and the circlet; 

And beside it there lay also one lonely snow- 
white magnolia, 

Bitter for remembrance of the healing which 
has passed. 

Fletcher, it should be understood, is the son 
of a Confederate veteran. 

Such things perhaps represent the "new 
poetry" at its highest, as regards theme and 
manner. Other phases, of course, produce other 
effects, shock, bewilderment, protest. Miss 
Lowell now and then protests on her own ac- 
count. Though it is the property and the 
privilege of a new school to believe in itself 
even to the exclusion of countenance for all other 
schools, past and future still one may dis- 
criminate. If she praises with heartiness she 
chides with keenness. Her exceptions are taken 
with the disconcerting candor, the unsparing 
lucidity of criticism that so often are shown 
within a narrow domestic circle. She perceives 
the limitations of "H. D." in her Greek modes. 
She scores the sex-obsession of "Spoon River," 
and the undisciplined diffuseness of its successors. 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



445 



She protests the verbal virtuosities of an un- 
chastened Fletcher: though she seems to regard 
him as the crown of the movement, his over- 
exuberance is against him; and, like Masters, 
he lacks the selective instinct. 

Miss Lowell rises gallantly to Carl Sandburg. 
The world knows her biography; and through 
her it may now know his. Were two people ever 
more unlike in origin, tradition, and experience? 
Yet a common danger and a common faith unite 
the little band; all worldly differences disappear 
before the lions. She apprehends Sandburg as 
the spokesman of the new "multi-racial" Amer- 
ica: "It is he and his ilk who are moving us 
away from our Anglo-Saxon inheritance," and 
who "bring us the points of view which are 
working so surely, if insidiously, upon the whole 
body of the people." Miss Lowell, herself some- 
thing of an adventurer and propagandist, seems 
willing enough to be moved on. Our population 
is "a crazy-quilt," true; "but how strong is that 
Anglo-Saxon ground-work which holds them all 
firmly to its shape, if no longer to its color!" 

Miss Lowell finds her Anglo-Saxon account 
in Robinson and in Robert Frost. The latter 
was born in San Francisco, but was claimed by 
Massachusetts at the age of ten, and has since 
been a dweller on that New England country- 
side which he celebrates so closely and narrowly. 
In fact, Frost has become as "down East" as 
pumpkin pie. Many of his pieces, in their tempo 
and their turn-out not always, by any means, in 
their subject! have some of the bland, self- 
containing rotundity of that sectional dish, and 
possibly something of its soggy undercrust; 
often, too, an insufficient measure of ginger makes 
the savor tame. But his commentator feels that 
he wins by his gentle understanding and his 
strong and unsentimental power of emotion, 
though his imagination is bounded by his life, 
and though he is "bent all one way, like the 
windblown trees of New England hillsides." 
Yet, after all, art is rooted in the soil; many 
besides Miss Lowell feel Frost's effect of quiet 
solidity and reality; so we must allow her to 
compare him with Burns, Synge, and Mistral 
and to rank him with them in the opinion of 
future generations. 

Yet, in the end, Amy Lowell's heart is with 
the imagists they are the end to which the 
whole new creation moves. She analyzes with 
fond minuteness the brief, staccato-cadenced 
pieces of "H. D.," reproducing in this connection 
the "brief list of tenets" on which the imagist 



poets are mutually agreed, and summarizing it 
thus: Simplicity and directness of speech; 
subtlety and beauty of rhythms; individualistic 
freedom of idea; clearness and vividness of pre- 
sentation; concentration; and for an after 
thought suggestion. But concentration most 
of all: "that is of the very essence of poetry." 
New rules and principles here? she asks. By 
no means, she answers. And who shall say her 
nay? 

Well, in her "Tendencies in Modern Ameri- 
can Poetry" Miss Lowell is emphatically 
"there"; there in heart, mind, and spirit; there 
with her faith and her reasons for it ; there with 
her polemical aptitudes and her full employment 
of them; on the spot, up to date, with her eye 
on the poetical clock, to the last second of the 
latest minute. But a clock has been known to 
strike thirteen and she has left out Vachel 
Lindsay. Who is more of our own land and 
of our own day ? Think of the whirr, the clang, 
the whole resonant jubilee! Has too strong a 
regard for architectonic symmetry excluded the 
tall, loud clock from the furnishings of the 
House of Present-Day Poetry? Is so joyous and 
hearty a fellow really to be ranked as a "popu- 
larizer" of the movement led by Sandburg and 
Masters? HENRY B. FULLER. 



Twin Prophets of Platitude and 
Paradox 

HEART TO HEART APPEALS. By William Jennings 
Bryan. (Fleming H. Revell Co.; $1.) 
Is CIVILIZATION A DISEASE? By Stanton Coit. 
(Houghton Mifflin Co.; $1.) 

"A speech," says Mr. Bryan, "may be dis- 
puted, even a sermon may not convince." I do 
not doubt that he speaks out of a wide and varied 
experience, and I hope that he will not be too 
much disappointed if opinion finds these heart- 
to-heart appeals of his a scrapbook of unconvinc- 
ing sermons and disputable speeches. Even so, 
they offer an answer, striking in its unanimity 
with Mr. Stanton Coit's own, to the remarkable 
question: Is Civilization a Disease? 

The question is not original with Mr. Coit. 
He once "deigned," he tells us, to read a book 
by that genius and sage, Edward Carpenter. 
Carpenter calls this book "Civilization, its Cause 
and Cure," and the reading led Mr. Coit at 
once to take sides against civilization. What he 
means by civilization, however, is not what is 
usually meant by the term. Usually we mean 



446 



THE DIAL 



[November 8 



by civilization the positive contributions of hu- 
man effort through human institutions to the 
enrichment and liberation of the powers of man. 
Civilization is a word of eulogy. But the clever 
Mr. Coit uses it as a word of condemnation. 
Quite in the inverted way of Mr. Gilbert Ches- 
terton, Mr. Coit makes the word civilization 
mean the defects and evil generated by human 
institutions. Civilization begins, he says, "with 
the crack of the whip"; it rests upon slaves and 
women; and history is the record of a conflict 
between man and it. On the side of man are 
Christ, St. Francis, Savonarola, Wycliffe, Lu- 
ther, John Wesley, Rousseau and company, Karl 
Marx, Peter Kropotkin, and Mr. Coit. The 
Reverend William Sunday, Mr. Theodore 
Roosevelt, and Mr. Bryan are not mentioned. 
The omission of the two former is intelligible, 
for if civilization is, as Mr. Coit declares, "the 
incarnation of self-interest," their indifference to 
civilization is not beyond dispute. But to leave 
Mr. Bryan out unless it be that Mr. Coit has 
read "Heart to Heart Appeals"! 

If he has, he must have been thrown into a 
state of perplexity, for these appeals are made 
now in behalf of man, and again in behalf of 
civilization. Thus: "The Darwinian theory rep- 
resents man as reaching his present perfection 
[i. e., what Mr. Coit means by civilization] by 
the operation of the law of hate the merciless 
law by which the strong crowd out and kill off 
the weak. . . If man links himself in generations 
with the monkey, it then becomes an important 
question whether he is going toward him or com- 
ing from him and I have seen them going in 
both directions. I do not know of any argument 
that can be used to prove that man is an im- 
proved monkey that may not be used just as well 
to prove that the monkey is a degenerate man, 
and the latter theory is more plausible than 
the former." "Miracle of miracles is man." 
Again, speaking of the present unpleasantness 
in Europe, Mr. Bryan says: "There must be 
a cause and it must be a human cause, for no 
one who loves God would ever blame Him for 
this inhuman war." Man, evidently, is in Mr. 
Bryan's opinion no better than he should be, 
but his civilization is a perfection particularly 
the civilization of America. Thus: 

Standing upon the vantage-ground already gained 
the American people can aspire to a grander destiny 
than has opened before any other race. Anglo-Saxon 
civilization has taught the individual to protect his 
own rights. American civilization will teach him to 
respect the rights of others. Anglo-Saxon civilization 



has taught the individual to take care of himself. 
American civilization, proclaiming the equality of all 
before the Jaw, will teach him that his own highest 
good requires the observance of the commandment: 
"Thou 'halt love thy neighbor as thyself." Anglo- 
Saxon civilization has, by force of arms, applied the 
art of government to other races for the benefit of 
Anglo-Saxons; American civilization will, by the in- 
fluence of example, excite in other races a desire for 
self-government and a determination to secure it. 
Anglo-Saxon civilization has carried its flag to every 
clime and defended it with forts and garrisons. 
American civilization will imprint its flag upon the 
hearts of all who long for freedom. 

To American civilization, all hail I 
Time's noblest offspring is the last. 

Mr. Coit might well get irritated as well as 
perplexed by these utterances of Mr. Bryan's. 
If, however, he should try to pass beyond the 
words to their meaning, he would be relieved. 
He would find Mr. Bryan's answer to his smart 
question a distinct affirmative. Indeed, rarely 
have illiterate sincerity and literate sophistication 
written so unanimously and from such different 
points of approach. It is not apparent from Mr. 
Coit's book how long he has entertained its dog- 
mas, but Mr. Bryan is an unparalleled example 
of doctrinal constancy. His book is composed 
of excerpts from speeches delivered, he tells us, 
during a quarter of a century, and there is not 
an idea in the last that does not appear in the 
first. Both he and Mr. Coit see certain evils 
in the life of man and propose certain remedies. 
The details of the proposals differ as the histo- 
ries and character of the men differ; their prin- 
ciples are the same. 

The flavor comes, of course, from the details. 
"I was," Mr. Bryan tells us, "eating a piece of 
watermelon some months ago, and was struck 
with its beauty." "Did you ever," he asks, 
"raise a radish?" and watermelon, and radish, 
and corn that he bought in Cairo, all lead to 
rhetoric about the Lord, concerning whose wishes 
and opinion Mr. Bryan seems as authoritative 
as another and less popular William. Mr. Coit 
does not have the Lord on his mind and certainly 
would not reach him through watermelons, rad- 
ishes, and corn from Cairo. His approach would 
be urbaceous rather than bucolic. But both he 
and Mr. Bryan are Christians. That is, they 
retain the naive attitude toward the Christ of 
Christianism, and they derive from Him author- 
ity for such opinions as they approve of, attrib- 
uting to "civilization," or to something else, the 
things and doctrines they dislike. Both exhibit 
the characteristic parochialism of the churchly 
Christian, to whom nothing can be good or re- 
ligious that has not that label. Both oppose the 



1917] 



THE DIAL

exploitation of the masses by the classes, invisible 
government, war, and the other bugaboos of social 
reformers. Both see corrective ideals as "the 
meaning of America," which is to them Chris- 
tianity. Both are blind, one through ignorance, 
the other not otherwise than wilfully, to the fact 
that the recognition of some of the advantages 
of unselfishness over selfishness is a common hu- 
man emotional event, which anticipated Chris- 
tianity many times and will succeed it many 
times. 

Prophets are these men, of better times com- 
ing: the one, in platitudes of age-old error, inno- 
cent through ignorance; the other, in paradoxes 
of modern lies, sophisticated through vanity. 
But their message is the same, and it is sounding 
enough. H. M. KALLEN. 



Criticism with an Unhappy 
Ending 

THE STUDY AND CRITICISM OF ITALIAN ART 
(Third Series). By Bernhard Berenson. (G.Bell 
& Sons, London.) 

As in another volume, which has appeared 
since, all but the first of the seven essays in this 
book are readjustments of certain prominent 
problems in the history of Venetian painting 
during the fifteenth century. The first, which 
alone concerns us here, is called a revaluation of 
Leonardo, and is an eloquent impeachment of 
his art. It is an elaborate and somewhat alarm- 
ing "showing-up" of a stately immortal whose 
memory has come down the centuries in invio- 
late purple. For Mr. Berenson would persuade 
us that Leonardo's renown as a universal genius 
and as a remarkable individual has exaggerated 
our rating of his achievement as an artist. And 
it is in the artist that Mr. Berenson is here 
narrowly interested. 

In disputing such a venerable reputation at 
all, our critic startles us with a contention that 
seems, at first, audacious in order to be novel 
and picturesque. For like Shakespeare, like 
Dante, Leonardo has gone as an acknowledged 
element of traditional culture, and his genius 
wins fresh converts every day among the small 
number of freer, autonomously aesthetic spirits, 
thus furnishing a special sanction, and evidence 
of its immediate and intrinsic virtue. An accu- 
mulation of respectable, scholarly authority, 
moreover, increased by the many ponderous vol- 
umes newly written about him, has put his 



fame beyond question, and widespread acqui- 
escence has raised it to a sort of divine immu- 
tability. 

As his priest and expositor, Mr. Berenson 
himself, some years ago, rationalized and ritu- 
alized the public worship of this deity, and may 
be said to be responsible for the flutter many 
of his devotees still dutifully undergo in the 
presence of his work. He put a reason into our 
minds for our fancied appreciations and told us 
what forms our appreciations ought to take. 
If one is therefore amazed at his apostasy, it is 
at least disquieting to find that his arraignment 
is radical, and may even seem unanswerable. 

He begins with an autobiographic account 
not without its dramatic interest of an artistic 
conscience corrupted by the attempt to reconcile 
the questionable effect upon him of Leonardo's 
work with academic formulas and literary word- 
charms. With continued exposure to the works 
themselves Mr. Berenson's elementary dilemma 
settles into the conviction that artistically they 
are far below their supposed level of excellence, 
and that popular and literary opinion, particu- 
larly Pater's notoriously beautiful passage, are 
mischievous misreadings. 

Considered historically, these pious falsifica- 
tions are ultimately due to a twofold tradition: 
one academic, the other personal. The former 
of these secured Leonardo's reputation as a great 
craftsman, the latter served to leaven the pre- 
vailing turn for myth-making, which threw a 
glamour over his artistic achievement. The aca- 
demic tradition proceeds from Leonardo's estab- 
lishment of two formulas, (1) contrapposto, or 
counterpoise, the twisting of the body on its own 
axis, and (2) chiaroscuro, a refinement upon the 
illusion of its vanishing planes. 

His counterpoise was an epitomized statement 
of the functional laws of the human structure. 
It struck its mean, and betrayed its scope. It 
brought out its motor possibilities, while it held 
it in unchanging equilibrium. His chiaroscuro 
provided the painter with a device for producing 
increased optical effects. It transferred the ex- 
istence of the objects in a picture from the realm 
of the determinate to the realm of extended sug- 
gestion. One was plastic in effect, the other 
pictorial, one "formal," the other technical in 
nature; between them they covered the whole 
field of artistic performance, and the academies 
made dogmas of them, and of Leonardo a sort of 
patron saint. 

But the perpetuation and growth of his repu- 
tation were assured by the survival of a tradi-

tion concerning his own person, the fabulous 
variety and distinction of his gifts, his calculated 
demeanor, his detachment, and his high, priv- 
ileged association. He was, moreover, the per- 
fect type of the myriad-minded era in which he 
lived, and he became a cult even in his own day. 
Not long after his death Vasari becomes his first 
hierographer. Vasari considers him divinely en- 
dowed by immediate and miraculous act of grace ; 
and though Mr. Berenson lays the final act of 
apotheosis to the Romantic idealism of the last 
century, Vasari's statements made three hundred 
years before are less likely to be figures of 
speech. 

Leonardo's innovations, however, were vicious 
in effect, and inartistic. They made the practice 
of art easier, and lowered its level of activity. 
They impoverished it, and doomed it to swift 
ending. But if they were the blight of Florentine 
art after him, they marred the finer qualities 
in his own. For Leonardo was less concerned 
with making his work yield aesthetic ecstasy 
(which is the measure of art), than with pro- 
ducing demonstrations of some principle of ar- 
rangement, of pose, of expression, or of execution, 
and consequently where aesthetic qualities are 
present in his works they are overlaid with for- 
mula and technical elaboration. "The aesthetic 
moment of the 'Mona Lisa' has been sacrificed 
to effects of chiaroscuro more subtly worked out, 
more insistently logical than any perhaps that 
had yet been achieved." 

Mr. Berenson's chief quarrel with Leonardo, 
however, is on the score of "illustration," as in 
the case of the "St. John," in the Louvre, where 
"the meaning suggested to us by a representation 
before us contradicts or opposes the spirit of the 
ostensible subject as conceived by ourselves." 
"For educated people," we are told, "visualize 
no matter how gropingly and vaguely the heroes 
and actions of story, and cherish a definite, if 
crude expectation of how they are to be repre- 
sented." But instead of a passionate ascetic, 
which is what we look for, we are shown a 
"well-fleshed epicene creature with an equivocal 
leer, pointing upward with an operatic twist as 
if to invite us to look up, not to Christ first 
appearing upon the world, but to Bacchus clat- 
tering along with all his rout." The dogma of 
illustration has been ignored and a spiritual con- 
vention outraged. "St. John" is a piece of un- 
expected, impudent blasphemy, full of unsavory 
suggestions. 



Even the "Last Supper" fails as "illustration," 
and its decoration is not distinguished enough 
to carry off its deficiencies; "the sinister and 
even criminal faces" of some of the figures and 
the purposeless grandiloquence of others are un- 
seemly, and Mr. Berenson sets one kind of vehe- 
mence against another in his denunciation of this 
"pack of vehement, gesticulating, noisy for- 
eigners." 

But if Mr. Berenson has disparaged some of 
the world's masterpieces, he has levelled strenu- 
ous argument and a savage loathing against the 
most honored, the "Mona Lisa." He has been 
lifting the gilt and patina that man and time 
have put there, layer by layer from the idol's 
face, and now he is gouging out its eyes. 

He owns the mastery, the "conscious art of 
the painter," the magnificence of the design ; but 
Mona Lisa is doomed, against his deeper insight, 
to remain what she is, "a foreigner with a look 
I could not fathom, watchful, sly, secure, with 
a smile of anticipated satisfaction and a pervad- 
ing air of hostile superiority." She baffles the 
spectator and even leads him to doubt his intelli- 
gence. She eludes all explicitness and attenuates 
all emphasis. She blooms with dim intimations, 
with "over-meanings," which swell into a mon- 
ster that torments us with its hundred-headed 
ambiguities. 

This view has a lordly lineage, and a knightly 
champion in our eminent authority. And yet, 
I must confess that, strange as Mona Lisa's 
smile has been declared, the commentary the 
centuries have written round it seems to me 
stranger still. To discern enigmas was a high 
recommendation in the mystery-mongering nine- 
teenth century of Ruskin and Pater, and since 
their day who has not rediscovered the unfath- 
omable in our fashionable Florentine? Criticism 
of a severer and narrower intention even, has 
been, thoughtfully and thoughtlessly, rehearsing 
well-worn judgments about her in precious para- 
phrase; and the result of thus pouring old wine 
into new bottles was to do no good to the wine: 
something of the savor of the real truth was 
each time lost. 

For Vasari the smile was a sort of trans- 
figuration of the features, and no more. But 
the critical practitioners of our own day with 
their more intimate insight and infinitely nicer 
methods have tried to account for it artistically. 
Mr. Cox anticipated in substance by Mr. 
Berenson thinks Leonardo had discovered that 



1917]

the expression of smiling is almost entirely a mat- 
ter of modelling (which is partly true), and that 
it interested him to produce a smile by delicate 
changes of surface alone (which is not wholly 
false). The undeniable truth, however, is that 
the smile is there, not only as a "result of tech- 
nical preoccupation" (which Mr. Berenson sug- 
gests as a possibility), but as an unmistakable 
sign of an irradiation of the human conscious- 
ness; and its evocations are, I humbly insist, due 
as much to its own presence as to the insinuating 
effect of the chiaroscuro. The smile is in the 
fugitive light a light coming from within 
which pauses for an instant and then passes. 
The smile and the modelling are really two 
aspects of the same thing, and the alleged enigma 
may lie in the abidance of the evanescent, in the 
paradoxical lingering of the transitory. 

It is equally hard to accept our critic's 
final appraisal of Leonardo, whom he would 
put down to Botticelli's level. And still harder 
is it to share his implicit tenet that the 
art of the Far East gives us a norm by 
which Leonardo's painting, and presumably 
all other painting, is to be measured. When 
he says that "there is nothing in Mona Lisa's 
expression that is not more satisfactorily ren- 
dered in Buddhist art" and that "There is noth- 
ing in the landscape that is not even more evoca- 
tive, and magical" in Chinese and Japanese 
painting, he chooses to ignore that Leonardo's 
picture is of a different aesthetic order, and be- 
longs to other modes of aesthetic experience. 
For who can deny that there are certain internal 
laws abiding in both arts which alienate them 
eternally, and that it is to some extent with sets 
of faculties accordingly different that we respond 
to either of them? Commensurate, therefore, 
though they be, they are not commensurate on 
the ground of their essential natures. 

We feel that this cardinal view gets its mo- 
mentum from the lofty, freely indulged bias of 
an exquisitely fastidious amateur; but, whether 
in the last analysis (which I neither pretend nor 
hope to reach) proved decisive or not, Mr. Ber- 
enson 's parti pris ought to be amiable and in- 
spiring, just because his standards are exalted 
and strenuously exclusive. To entertain his res- 
olute prejudices against the realism of the "Last 
Supper," or his disapproval of the "uncomfort- 
able suggestions" of "The Leda," of the "St. 
John," and of Leonardo's tainted taste, is to 
bring deeper insight to, and win greater admira- 
tion for, the less obvious beauties of archaic 



Greek sculpture and the exalted arts of the 
East. 

Even if Leonardo does not seem wholly to 
come to his rights in this remarkable essay, the 
incidental criticism and the fresh point of view 
are boldly significant. The original inquiry, 
moreover, moves through a rich field of general 
ideas toward many interesting ultimate issues. 
Indeed it is far-reaching and fundamental. It 
carries in it a revision of view concerning a 
number of Leonardo's great contemporaries, 
whose glory has similarly flowered, and flour- 
ished. It implicitly urges upon the historical 
theorist a reinterpretation of the whole Renais- 
sance, and upon the political historian a revalua- 
tion of its conspicuous figures and events. To 
the philosopher of taste it suggests a reformation 
of ultimate standards of aesthetic judgment. 

RICHARD OFFNER. 



Get-Rich-Quick Philosophy 

PHILOSOPHY AND THE SOCIAL PROBLEM. By Will 
Durant. (The Macmillan Co.; $1.50.) 

Perhaps it was still possible a generation ago 
for a single mind to master the accumulated 
knowledge of the world. If so, the twentieth 
century has added so enormously to the flood of 
detailed information that the thing is no longer 
possible. What then is to be the fate of the 
philosopher, "the spectator of all time and all 
existence"? Is he to become a cultural vermi- 
form appendix? Or will he change his function 
and adapt himself to meet the new needs of the 
organism? One by one the sciences have left 
their common mother, Philosophy; have set up 
independent households, and have become respon- 
sible for numerous progeny. Psychology, long a 
darling child, has lately begun pulling most scan- 
dalously at the apron strings, while even Ethics 
is showing a lack of interest in things about the 
house and is looking more and more pensively 
out of the windows. There really appears to be 
danger that in our time all the children may get 
started in life for themselves. Is Philosophy to 
be a good old lady with nothing to do but sit 
quietly in the corner, fold her impotent hands, 
and wait for the quiet end? 

By no means, answers the author of "Philos- 
ophy and the Social Problem." Let Mother 
Philosophy change her diet and take pragmatic 
treatments! The result will be miraculous. 
With color returned to her cheeks, a recovered

[November 8 



appetite, the stiffness gone from her joints, and a 
new light in her eye, Philosophy will once more 
be hailed as queen of the sciences, and men will 
again turn to her for inspiration and for guidance. 

If it be suspected that this light-hearted resto- 
ration of youth and vigor to philosophy is a 
caricature, I can only suggest (and I urge it on 
other grounds) that the reader consult Mr. Du- 
rant's book. "Philosophy," says the author, "was 
once mistress of all the disciplines of thought and 
search ; now none so poor to do her reverence." 
And this lapse from her former significance and 
vitality is due (as John Dewey recently put it) 
to "chewing a historic cud long since reduced to 
woody fibre." Unless philosophy is revitalized 
by turning from "a study of the details of super- 
seded systems" to "the study of the miraculous 
living moment in which the past melts into the 
present and the future finds creation," philosophy 
will sink still lower in the "calm death of social 
ineffectiveness." 

Now, really, what evidence have we that phi- 
losophy is in such a bad way? We have an- 
nouncements, like this of Mr. Durant's, made 
from the house tops. But have we anything 
more? Is it not true that university courses in 
philosophy have grown in recent years both in 
numbers and in vital interest? Is there not more 
rather than less of a demand for philosophical 
literature? In matters of this sort one is gener- 
ally dependent upon impressions, but a wide- 
spread impression is not always a bad guide, and 
there is certainly a wide-spread impression in 
academic circles that philosophy has experienced 
a revival rather than a decline in the last decade 
or two. Neither is the interest confined to what 
Mr. Durant, with amusing arbitrariness, calls 
the vital philosophers, Plato, Bacon, Spinoza, 
and Nietzsche, nor to the "few" professors of 
philosophy "who insist on focussing thought on 
life." Not only are classic speculators like Des- 
cartes, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume seriously 
studied in large elective classes conducted by 
men not as yet won to the "revitalized" philoso- 
phy, but even Kant (whom the good pragmatist 
cannot name without crossing himself) comes 
in for a good share of attention. This may be 
deplorable, but it shows that many people are 
interested in problems which Mr. Durant would 
have them find dull and dry. The explanation 
is, of course, that it is not the matter but the 
manner that counts. Enough wholesale denun- 
ciation may yet succeed in convincing people of 
the futility and ineffectiveness of philosophical 



speculation. But in that case there is reason to 
fear that no exception will be made in favor of 
Mr. Durant's form of pragmatism. No one, it 
seems, is so unconscious of danger as the man who 
is sawing off the limb upon which he sits. In the 
case of Mr. Durant the limb is sawed almost 
through, and I appear to see the wide jaws of 
sociology spread to receive him. 

Now, disaster to philosophy is just what the 
author labors to ward off, provided it be true 
philosophy, "the intellectual reconstruction of 
life" rather than the "intellectual categorizing 
of experience." When he thinks of the philoso- 
phers transformed into social engineers, platting 
out the map of life and harnessing the genius of 
the race for the renewing of creation, his optimism 
knows no bounds. It is only because present- 
day philosophers are not hot with what he be- 
lieves to be passion for social perfection that he 
will none of them. 

If this is good pragmatism, it is somewhat sur- 
prising. One would expect a philosophy which 
has given a new significance to the principle of 
relativity to be less dogmatic; to allow at least 
for a programme which is concerned not with 
immediate but with distant ends, and which aims 
to affect the social structure indirectly and com- 
prehensively through the enlargement of men's 
mental outlook and the broadening of human sym- 
pathies, rather than directly through the solution 
of concrete, everyday problems. Alas, not even 
Kant could be more inflexible. Here is a nasty 
slum. Take hold; see that it is cleaned up; or 
admit you are a mossback and not a philosopher. 
Or if you are a philosopher, then it is high time 
we had a new type. This is Mr. Durant's prag- 
matic challenge. Well, it is interesting that the 
contemporary philosopher whom he admits into 
the front rank is Bertrand Russell, widely known 
for his long and brilliant occupation with "intel- 
lectual dead-issues." I quote a paragraph and a 
footnote : 

Philosophy was vital in Plato's day; so vital that 
some philosophers were exiled and others were put to 
death. No one would think of putting a philosopher 
to death today. Not because men are more delicate 
about killing; but because there is no need to kill that 
which is already dead. 

It would be invidious to name the exceptions which 
one is glad to remember here ; but it is in place to say 
that the practical arrest of Bertrand Russell is a sign 
of resuscitation on the part of philosophy, a sign for 
which all lovers of philosophy should be grateful. 
When philosophers are once more feared, philosophy 
will once more be respected. 

Mr. Durant's admiration of Bertrand Rus- 
sell does him credit, but it shows the futility of 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



451 



insisting that a philosopher who wishes to count 
socially must go at it in a particular way. Or 
will Mr. Durant maintain that Bertrand Rus- 
sell is solely significant as the author of such 
books as "Justice in War Time" and "Why Men 
Fight"? 

See, then, how the real philosopher gets into 
the game. Feminism, socialism, eugenics, an- 
archism, all the isms, says Mr. Durant, have 
nothing to offer toward the solution of social 
problems. They are like the unintelligent, ran- 
dom movements of a monkey trying to solve a 
puzzle. This he makes clear by means of a 
dialogue in the course of which the various isms 
prove one another futile. After this reductio ad 
absurdum, he turns to the sciences. Alas, there is 
a great defect in the sciences also: they are 
"shredded," "fragmentated," piecemeal. Science 

becomes more and more a fragmentated thing, with 
ever less coordination, ever less sense of the whole. 
Our industrial system has forced division of labor 
here, as in the manual trades, almost to the point of 
idiocy: let a man seek to know everything about some- 
thing, and he will soon know nothing about anything 
else; efficiency will swallow up the man. 

It is "this shredded science" which calls loudly 
for coordination. And here is philosophy's 
chance. Science furnishes the shredded wheat; 
philosophy must bake the biscuit. How? By 
taking the "essentials from the sciences," coor- 
dinating these into a "sense of the whole," and 
guiding scientific research by the aid of this 
vision. The scientist is a wizard in the labora- 
tory, but for that very reason is near-sighted. 
He has a poor sense of direction regarding the 
utility of his experiments. It is the philosopher's 
function "to point the nose of science to a goal." 
He will "do the listening to today's science, and 
then do the thinking for tomorrow's statesman- 
ship." 

Of course one might object that something 
more than a well-arranged dialogue is required 
to prove that the isms are not, as many people 
think, effective engines of concrete social reform ; 
and the scientists might object to being led by 
the nose, even if we were agreed on its desira- 
bility. One wonders, moreover, whether the 
proposed "coordination of the essentials of sci- 
ence" is not simply an invitation to the professor 
of philosophy to deceive himself into believing 
that he is still master of the world's knowledge. 
But I have not the heart to attempt to trip such 
romping enthusiasm by littering the ground with 
difficulties. For the same reason the reader is 
left to acquaint himself with the "Society for 



Social Research" and the author's unrestrained 
adoration of the college professor. After all, the 
central issue raised by the book grows out of Mr. 
Durant's contention that unless philosophy is 
ready to adopt a get-rich-quick programme, it has 
no further excuse for being. 

Notwithstanding the shrill insistence upon a 
particular type of philosopher, which gives to the 
book a tone of dogmatism probably not war- 
ranted by the spirit of the author, and in spite 
of a certain innocence respecting the stubborn- 
ness of human nature and the inertia of social 
institutions, which gives the discussion a flavor 
of immaturity, the book is an interesting plea 
for a philosophy that can pay its way in immedi- 
ate practical results. The author says things that 
need repeating, and he says them eloquently and 
earnestly. Especially is this true of the thesis 
of the volume: the need of organizing intelli- 
gence in behalf of a better human society, nation- 
ally and internationally. I fear, however, that 
his plan of campaign, if followed, would only get 
philosophy the reputation of being a gadding busy- 
body, meddling in everybody's business, having 
none of her own. jy/j Q OTTO. 



Goethe 



GOETHE. By Calvin Thomas. (Henry Holt & 

Co.; $2.) 

Goethe holds a higher position in German 
literature than any other man has ever held in any 
other literature. No adjectives can appraise 
Shakespeare; but if we had to choose between 
having Shakespeare and having all English lit- 
erature outside of Shakespeare, we should let the 
swan of Avon follow the swan of Lohengrin 
into any sea-change he cared to assume. It is 
quite otherwise with Goethe. Goethe alone is 
richer than all the rest of German literature put 
together. This is not merely because of his 
amazing versatility ; it is because of his still more 
amazing excellence, for in every kind of book he 
wrote, except in science and mathematics, he 
went to the top. He is Germany's greatest poet, 
dramatist, novelist, and critic. Tennyson's fine 
compliment to him in "In Memoriam" certainly 
does not overstate the truth he sang "to one 
clear harp in divers tones." It is indeed a 
remarkable fact that one individual's literary pro- 
duction should exceed in value the combined con- 
tribution of his predecessors, contemporaries, and 
followers. I can think of no parallel to this.

[November 8 



To lovers of literature, not Berlin, but Weimar, 
is the capital of Germany. 

In his interesting preface, Professor Thomas 
says, "Every scholar has his own Dante, his own 
Shakespeare, his own Goethe. This book pre- 
sents my Goethe as I see him after nearly forty 
years of university teaching during which he has 
never been long out of my thoughts. I came to 
him as an undergraduate by way of Carlylc." 
Well, although I do not know one-hundredth as 
much about him as Professor Thomas knows, 
for I have never been a professional student or 
teacher of Goethe, I came to him even earlier, 
by the same route. I fell under his spell at the 
age of fifteen, and have never been out of it since. 
Nearly every book that charmed me, Froude's 
brilliant sketch of Caesar among others, men- 
tioned a person by the name of Goethe, a name 
I could not pronounce. But he was always men- 
tioned with immense respect, for the time had 
long gone by when De Quincey had found it safe 
to sneer at him as a "German litterateur," and 
to make this prophecy: "the honours of Coler- 
idge are perennial and will annually grow more 
verdant ; whilst from those of Goethe every gen- 
eration will see something fall away, until pos- 
terity will wonder at the subverted idol, whose 
basis being hollow and unsound, will leave the 
worship of their fathers an enigma to their 
descendants." 

Carlyle settled the business for me. I read his 
translation of "Wilhelm Meister," and became 
so enchanted by the characters in that wonderful 
story, that years later, when I heard the opera 
"Mignon" for the first time, I felt an indescrib- 
able thrill as each one of my favorite persons took 
the stage. It was as though a group of intensely 
loved friends had all risen from the dead and 
come back to cheer me with their bodily pres- 
ence. There are greater operas than "Mignon" ; 
but no other opera can affect me in precisely 
that way. 

It is almost impossible to open any book writ- 
ten by Goethe and not immediately find some- 
thing stimulating. To test this now at my desk, 
I opened one, and the first thing I saw was, "The 
theatre has often been at variance with the pul- 
pit; they ought not, I think, to quarrel. How 
much it is to be wished, that in both, the cele- 
bration of Nature and of God were intrusted to 
none but men of noble minds!" 

No matter if a new biography of Goethe were 
published each month, there would still be a 
place for a book by Professor Thomas. With his 



sound scholarship, cool judgment, clear common 
sense, keen humor, and long experience, he could 
hardly fail to write something valuable and 
important. But as a matter of fact, there was 
an urgent need for this particular work; for 
unless I am mistaken, there has been no impor- 
tant Life of Goethe written in English since the 
year 1855, when the notable biography by G. H. 
Lewes appeared. 

Mr. Thomas's book is divided into two parts 
the impersonal and the personal. The first 
part, covering 167 pages, is a simple, straight- 
forward account of Goethe's life. This treat- 
ment reveals a rather remarkable skill in the 
great art of omission; for everything essential is 
there, and receives due attention and emphasis. 
No German could possibly have written these 
chapters. Unimportant details and personal prej- 
udices are absent. Much has been sacrificed to 
secure clearness and concision, but it is literally 
true that every page is interesting, for the style 
has movement. 

Then, forsaking the realm of unadorned fact, 
Mr. Thomas enters the world of ideas. The 
remaining 185 pages are divided into the follow- 
ing chapters: "The Philosopher," "The Evolu- 
tionist," "The Believer," "The Poet," "The 
Dramatist," "The Novelist," "The Critic," 
"Faust." Here the treatment is individual. It 
is the author's Goethe, and nobody else's, who is 
revealed to us, and this is what we want the 
real justification for the appearance of the book. 

It is seldom that anyone can find fault with a 
work for being too short ; but I think this should 
have been longer. And I do not mean it as a 
compliment. Professor Thomas's admirable 
"Life and Works of Schiller" is more than a 
hundred pages longer than the "Goethe," and 
surely there is not more worth saying about Schil- 
ler than about his greater contemporary. In the 
endeavor, commendable in itself, to avoid pro- 
lixity, there is a feeling in these later chapters 
of abruptness, scantiness, insufficiency. There is 
never any sense of inadequacy on the part of the 
author, which makes undue brevity all the more 
unfortunate. 

Another thing. Professor Thomas has of 
course read all the important books on Goethe 
written by Germans. He must have become 
thoroughly aweary of rhapsodical adulation. For 
the attitude of most German biographers and 
critics to the great sage has been characterized, 
not by intelligent and discriminating criticism, 
but by idolatry. Now, idolatry may possibly be 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



453 



of some assistance to the worshipper but, as a 
rule, it helps neither the idol nor the spectators. 
Professor Thomas not only refuses to kneel; he 
bends over backward. One gets the impression 
that at the outset of his task he took a solemn 
vow not to slop over. This would be well 
enough if his admiration for Goethe were only 
moderate. But in the preface, although admit- 
ting that the halo has "grown a little dimmer 
in the lapse of years," he says, "I am conscious 
of owing more to him than to any other writer 
of books." One would not suspect this in reading 
the chapters on "The Poet," on "The Dram- 
atist," on "The Critic." Indeed, one who had 
never read Goethe would not believe him to be 
either a first-class poet or a first-class critic. The 
chapter on "The Critic" is positively cold. The 
temperature rises notably in the chapter on 
"Faust," which is quite properly reserved to 
make the final impression. My suspicion that 
Mr. Thomas is writing with German rhapsodies 
in mind is heightened by reading the chapter on 
"The Believer," where a strong case is almost 
ardently supported. The chapter contains this 
excellent saying: "Looked at in a large histor- 
ical survey religion may be conceived as a four- 
sided pyramid one side of which is cult, a second 
theology, a third ethics, and the fourth mystic 
emotion." The fourth side is what interested 
Goethe, and in that sense he was surely not only 
a deeply religious man, but an inspiring religious 
teacher, as even I, a convinced Christian, have 
always found him. Still, he was not nearly so 
great a religious teacher as he was a poet and 
artist. 

This book is written for English readers. One 
does not need to know a word of German to 
enjoy and to profit by it. It is interesting to 
observe with what scrupulous care Mr. Thomas 
has avoided using German words. Ordinarily a 
book on this subject would have been thickly 
bespattered with them. They occur so seldom 
never except when necessary that they produce 
a shock. And one might almost say that no word 
of any kind is used except when necessary. I 
feel sure that I have never read a combination 
of biography and criticism of this size, where 
such extraordinary pains to avoid superfluities in 
speech have been taken. Even some English 
words have been "simplified" in order to pack 
everything into as small a space as is possible. 
The author has a tight rein on himself. 

The chapter on "Faust," as it ought to be, is 
the best in the book. I have never seen anywhere 



so fine a discussion of Goethe's optimism. He 
sees "Faust," not as the English or the French 
see it, but as Goethe must have seen it himself. 
Mr. Thomas abundantly confirms the view 
revealed to me thirty years ago, when I saw 
Henry Irving produce the play in the afternoon, 
and Ernst Possart produce it in the evening of 
the same day. And Irving's manager was there 
in a box ready to present Possart with a wreath 
from the famous English actor. But when the 
curtain rose and the "Prolog im Himmel" began, 
the manager went out and informed Irving that 
Possart was not acting "Faust" that night, but 
some other piece. 

Professor Thomas has written a sound and 
'good book, a credit to American scholarship and 
criticism. He has shown commendable amenity 
in two ways by avoiding footnotes and by being 
steadily and delightfully interesting. And even 
those who still under the dominion of German 
pedantry believe that a sprightly, luminous style 
is incompatible with true scholarship, cannot 
fail to recognize the learning so unpretentiously 
and modestly displayed. Professor Thomas has 
long been a recognized authority, and if he were 
not, this book would make him one. It will be 
many years before students and lovers of Goethe 
will find it possible to neglect this crown of a 
life's work. WILLIAM LYON PHELPS.

Mr. Wilfrid Wilson Gibson seems a young 
man to be giving us his collected poems; it is, in 
fact, a little startling to find that even if most 
of his early work is omitted, as in this collection, 
he has published so much. In addition to the 
more realistic studies, by which Mr. Gibson has 
chiefly earned his reputation, "Daily Bread," 
"Womenkind," "Fires," "Borderlands and 
Thoroughfares," "Livelihood," and "Battle," 
this rather unwieldy volume contains also one 
poem in an earlier vein, "Akra the Slave," a use- 
ful reminder that, like his fellow-poet Mr. 
Masefield, Mr. Gibson has evolved in manner 
from romanticism to realism. When one con- 
siders in this connection some of Mr. Gibson's

[November 8 



very latest work, particularly in the lyric and in 
the sonnet form, where he seems tentatively to 
be teasing once more at colors more frankly 
brilliant, it is possible to suspect that, again like 
Mr. Masefield, he has fed himself to satiety on 
the drab and realistic and may yet revert to the 
romantic, an evolution altogether natural. 

Mr. Gibson's development has, however, been 
more obvious and orderly than Mr. Masefield's. 
It was not, in his case, a sudden surrender to an 
overpowering and perhaps previously unconscious 
impulse, but rather a gradual modification. Even 
in "Akra the Slave," for example, there are hints 
of the close psychological texture which was later 
to reach its maximum of efficiency as a poetic 
style in "Fires" and "Livelihood." In "Daily 
Bread" and "Womenkind," pitched in a collo- 
quial dramatic form (or dialogue, rather, closely 
akin to Mr. Abercrombie's use of the same form 
in parts of "Emblems of Love"), there was 
necessarily a good deal of waste. Mr. Gibson's 
genius is not dramatic, and he found himself pre- 
cluded from the sort of step-by-step, objective 
analysis which is his keenest pleasure. Conse- 
quently, this is the weakest part of his work. In 
"Fires," on the other hand, lies the happiest 
synthesis of all Mr. Gibson's talents. In these 
brief, rhymed narratives, dealing for the most part 
with the lives of working-people, but not too in- 
sistently in a drab tone, Mr. Gibson found him- 
self free to exploit side by side his love of color 
and his love of sharp analysis. The result is a 
sort of iterative half-lyric analysis, frequently 
powerful. In "Borderlands," "Livelihood," and 
"Battle," however, the lyric and colorful aspect 
has gone dwindling in proportion as the psy- 
chological preoccupation has increased. Un- 
fortunately, the gain in truthfulness has not 
entirely compensated for the loss in beauty. In 
some of the poems which compose the volume 
called "Battle," for example, it may be ques- 
tioned whether actual bathos was not reached : to 
truthfulness Mr. Gibson seems here to have sacri- 
ficed everything, even dignity. One admits his 
truthfulness, but one does not feel it. 

It is, of course, too early to attempt a placing 
of Mr. Gibson. For the present it is enough to 
say that he has developed a style peculiarly effec- 
tive, and valuable too for its influence on con- 
temporary poetry. Mr. Gibson has clearly 
proved that poetry can deal with the common- 
places of daily life, with the bitter and trivial 
and powerful and universal commonplaces of 
human consciousness, and do it with force and 



beauty. None of his contemporaries on either 
side of the Atlantic has equalled him in power 
to drag forth, link by link, the image-chain of a 
human mood. We cannot yet begin complaining 
that these moods have a hypnotic sameness 
throughout his work; nor that he varies the 
monotony of these analytical studies with too little 
of that romantic flush which, one cannot help 
thinking, no less than an excessive love of matter- 
of-fact, is a part of consciousness. Mr. Gib- 
son lacks the lyric elan for this, just as he 
also lacks flexibility of technique. But these are 
questions which perhaps will be settled anew with 
every epoch according to the prevailing taste ; one 
cannot be dogmatic about them. To-day we like 
Mr. Gibson for his dogged truthfulness, and we 
shy at his occasional pedestrian sentimentality. A 
later judge may conceivably reverse the verdict. 

Mr. Bradley is obviously a congener of Mr. 
Gibson. The poems in his "Old Christmas" are, 
for the most part, narrative and in much the same 
form that Mr. Gibson is most fond of using: the 
octosyllabic couplet. It cannot be pretended that 
this is poetry of a high order; but Mr. Bradley, 
in adapting to his use the life of the Kentucky 
mountain-folk, has hit upon extremely interest- 
ing material; he has given us some excellent 
stories, told in the folk-language, with many 
quaintnesses of idiom, and, on the whole, with the 
simplicity and economy that makes for effect. Mr. 
Bradley's technique is useful rather than brilliant 
he seldom rises above the level of the story- 
teller. In "Saul of the Mountains," "Old 
Christmas," or the "Prince of Peace," the story 
obviously is the thing, and the story does the trick. 
When, as occasionally happens, Mr. Bradley 
shows genuine imaginative power (as in the 
"Strange Woman" and its sequel) it is hard to 
say how much that power is fortuitous. 

Mr. T. S. Eliot, whose book "Prufrock and 
Other Observations" is really hardly more than 
a pamphlet, is also a realist, but of a different 
sort. Like Mr. Gibson, Mr. Eliot is a psycholo- 
gist; but his intuitions are keener; his technique 
subtler. For the two semi-narrative psychologi- 
cal portraits which form the greater and better 
part of his book, "The Love Song of J. Alfred 
Prufrock" and "The Portrait of a Lady," one 
can have little but praise. This is psychological 
realism, but in a highly subjective or introspective 
vein; whereas Mr. Gibson, for example, gives 
us, in the third person, the reactions of an 
individual to a situation which is largely exter- 
nal (an accident, let us say), Mr. Eliot gives us, 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



455 



in the first person, the reactions of an individual 
to a situation for which to a large extent his own 
character is responsible. Such work is more purely 
autobiographic than the other the field is 
narrowed, and the terms are idiosyncratic (some- 
times almost blindly so). The dangers of such 
work are obvious : one must be certain that one's 
mental character and idiom are sufficiently close 
to the norm to be comprehensible or significant. 
In this respect, Mr. Eliot is near the border- 
line. His temperament is peculiar, it is some- 
times, as remarked heretofore, almost bafflingly 
peculiar, but on the whole it is the average hyper- 
aesthetic one with a good deal of introspective 
curiosity; it will puzzle many, it will delight a 
few. Mr. Eliot writes pungently and sharply, 
with an eye for unexpected and vivid details, 
and, particularly in the two longer poems and in 
"The Rhapsody of a Windy Night," he shows 
himself to be an exceptionally acute technician. 
Such free rhyme as this, with irregular line 
lengths, is difficult to write well, and Mr. Eliot 
does it well enough to make one wonder whether 
such a form is not what the adorers of free 
verse will eventually have to come to. In the 
rest of Mr. Eliot's volume one finds the piquant 
and the trivial in about equal proportions. 

Mr. Erskine has at best a dubious claim to 
a share in the title of this review. Most critics 
would call him a classicist : he writes, in a fairly 
orotund blank verse, of Satan, the death of reli- 
gion, the "Sons of Metaneira." Unfortunately 
Mr. Erskine dons a little too self-consciously the 
robes of the grand manner. One must forge 
through many sonorous and archaic Miltonic 
echoes, many valueless inversions, to come upon 
the occasional imaginative power or delicacy. 
In the "Sons of Metaneira" he is at his best: the 
story is told without strain, with effective touches 
of dignity and simplicity, and occasionally with 
sharp realization of scene. CQNRAD 



The Truth About War 

UNDER FIRE. By Henri Barbusse. (E. P. Button 
& Co.; $1.50.) 

Henri Barbusse's poilus have a "sacramental 
saying" that economizes profanity: victory is 
certain "if the civilians hold out." It is a bit 
of irony that has not been lost on M. Barbusse. 
He at least can be accused of no tenderness for 
civilian sensibilities. He is magnificently indif- 
ferent to the curious editorial taboo which re- 



sults in the frigid brevity of the war dispatch and 
the inhuman abstractions of Mr. Frank H. 
Simonds. To a man tremendously in earnest 
who wanted to make those at home see and feel 
the war yes, and smell it, too any squeamish- 
ness would naturally be a simple irrelevance. It 
would not be thought of, and M. Barbusse hasn't 
thought of it. The result is a book of terrific 
impact, a horrible and fascinating document that 
brings one nearer to the desolation and despair 
of No Man's Land than anything else I have 
read. 

If "Under Fire" convinces you that you are 
at last hearing something like the truth, it is 
because it is so obviously an honest book. It is 
as innocent of false emphasis as it is of ordinary 
reserves. If M. Barbusse makes out an over- 
whelming case against war, it is not by falsify- 
ing the evidence, by careful selection and 
suppression. His book is impressive by reason, 
largely, of its inclusiveness. So fine an intelli- 
gence as his is not tempted to be unscrupulous, 
because it sees that the case presents itself and 
can only be ruined by embellishment or distor- 
tion in the interest of an argument. It can be 
ruined by fanaticism, too, as the pacifist usually 
ruins it. It can be ruined, finally, by any 
suspicion of hypersensitiveness or any morbid 
obsession with the horrible. To write a really 
effective indictment of war, a man has first to 
persuade us of his sheer normality and the 
strength of his nerves. He has to convince us 
that he is not overcivilized and that he can be 
more or less at home with the primordial. He 
may loathe it, as M. Barbusse loathes war, but 
the mere sight of its excesses won't topple him 
over. He is prepared for anything. All of 
which is only a clumsy way of saying that 
"Under Fire" is not a piece of propaganda, a 
work of pure horror designed to keep the reader 
at one emotional pitch and that the least en- 
durable through three hundred and fifty odd 
pages. No; for even in war actual fighting 
remains a little exceptional; the casual and the 
trivial bulk quite as large as they do in the lives 
of men at home. Only, the discomfort is on a 
gigantic scale and the dislocations of habit are 
without parallel. In the work of rebarbarization 
they count quite as heavily as the insane fury 
of the assault. M. Barbusse shows very subtly 
how all these influences play on the men and 
mould them; how they are transforming the 
massed humanity at the front. His book is filled 
with a kind of primordial humor, with pene- 
trating criticism, with a truly Gothic grotesquery, 



456 



THE DIAL 



[November 8 



with a great and moving tenderness for the 
patched and wretched cave-men armored in mud, 
crawled over by lice, sleeping in dung, and sent 
at intervals across the hell of No Man's Land 
to slay or be slain as chance serves. 

When we meet the men of the squad 
peasants and artisans of the lowest class, the 
true heroes of the war they are awash on "an 
endless grey sheet that floats on the sea and has 
here and there gone under." M. Barbusse does 
not dabble in childish symbolism, but there is a 
complete appropriateness in his initial picture of 
a water-logged world in which "even the wan 
light seems to flow." Water is, in fact, a sort 
of motif to which he returns again and again, 
until he sums up his final impression for us "on 
the wrecked and dissolving plain, flecked with 
bodies between its worm-shaped chasms of 
water, among the islands of motionless men 
stuck together like reptiles in this flattening and 
sinking chaos" "I used to think that the worst 
hell in war was the flame of shells ; and then for 
long I thought it was the suffocation of the 
caverns which eternally confine us. But it is 
neither of these things. Hell is water." 

Like the author himself, the men of his squad 
are tortured by the need of finding words into 
which they can pack all their misery, so that 
what remains incredible even to them may be 
made credible to those who have stayed at home. 
What is war? One of the men looks out on 
the "calamitous plain," with bodies strewn "here 
and there in the vastness like foul rubbish" he 
looks and says, "That's war ... It's not 
anything else." And the author interprets his 
thought: "He means and I am with him in his 
meaning more than attacks that are like cere- 
monial reviews, more than visible battles unfurled 
like banners, more even than hand-to-hand 
encounters of shouting strife, War is frightful 
and unnatural weariness, water up to the belly, 
mud and dung and infamous filth. It is befouled 
faces and tattered flesh, it is corpses that are no 
longer like corpses even, floating on the ravenous 
earth." 

Such, M. Barbusse shows us, in a succession 
of episodes that are, I suppose, broadly typical 
such is war to the common soldier. The im- 
pression that he wishes to drive home, and that 
he does drive home with cumulative force, is 
one of infinite boredom and inhuman discomfort, 
of the pervasively disintegrating action of war 
upon a group of men who have outgrown the 



mood of war and whom circumstances cannot 
quite thrust back into that mood. The lust for 
blood may, in fact, be stimulated, along with 
other lusts, but what M. Barbusse insists upon 
is that it is no longer stimulated enough. The 
men themselves feel this as they watch the black 
troops getting ready to go into action. The 
Africans are real soldiers, made for the business 
of slaughter. But in themselves the peasant and 
the artisan are only overlaid, not obliterated ; 
and that makes a tragic difference. 

And what is their reaction to the war? Is it 
simply a hopeless and confused acquiescence? By 
no means. They are fighting the war in a spirit 
of fine generosity, with complete dedication of 
themselves; they are trying to save what no 
longer exists for them the comfortable civiliza- 
tion of Europe. And they are trying to under- 
stand, to emerge "from the delusion and 
ignorance which soil them as the mud soils 
them." What is it that causes war, they ask. 
It is the spirit of militarism, one answers. 
" 'Germany and militarism they're the same 
thing.' " No ; that is too simple. " 'To-day 
militarism is called Germany.' . . 'Yes, but 
what will it be called to-morrow?' 'After all, 
what is it that makes the mass and horror of 
war?' 'It's the mass of the people.' 'But the 
people that's us.' 'Yes, that's true. It's the 
people who are war; without them, there would 
be nothing, nothing but some wrangling, a long 
way off. But it isn't they who decide on it ; 
it's the masters who steer them' 'The people 
are struggling to-day to have no more masters 
who steer them. This war, it's like the French 
Revolution continuing.'" And then: "The 
people of the world ought to come to an under- 
standing, through the hides and on the bodies 
of those who exploit them one way and another. 
All the masses ought to agree together." 

I am aware that the passages I have quoted, 
and especially the last, do a disservice to the 
author. Nothing in the book has the neatness 
and salience that such sentences have in a review. 
"Under Fire" is like a panorama which mu^t 
be taken in at a sweep; its impressive bigness 
depends upon the cumulative effect of n host of 
small impressions which cannot be subtracted 
from the whole. To review such a book is 
obviously impossible; one can only recommend 
it. It is the sort of book which everyone who 
wants to know what war is actually like will 
have to read for himself.

MR. GEORGE JEAN NATHAN PRESENTS. 

Alfred A. Knopf; $1.50. 

What "Mr. George Jean Nathan Presents" 
is largely himself; we get him somewhat in the 
guise of a naughty altar-boy. He kneels before 
the shrine, he swings the censer, he goes through 
certain genuflexions; yet he contrives to grimace 
at the reverent throng and to tip the wink that 
the worshipful Mystery is too much of a humbug 
to merit much regard. A man cannot live 
live exclusively and consciously in a realm of 
unworthy make-believe without suffering for it ; 
and Mr. George Jean Nathan, in some of his 
phases, is calculated to cause regrets. He is 
mighty knowing and capable in his field, but he 
is brash. He opens up some wonderful, sudden 
vistas for the playgoer, and shoots a number of 
penetrating epigrams; but his taste and dis- 
cretion are not equal to his brilliancy. Though 
from Fort Wayne, as his biography on the 
jacket informs us, he has come to be more 
metropolitan than most of the metropolitans 
themselves self-possessed to the uttermost verge 
of the unabashed and as cynical as you 
please. One wonders how he would act if 
he met Truth and Right Feeling face to face: 
according to his own confession of experiences, 
he seems unlikely to meet them in the modern 
theatre, his sole milieu. He is a sort of latter- 
day Israfel, playing "wildly," however "well," 
on the keyboard of Good Taste; he jabs, prods, 
counters, scrambles a loud, bizarre, but com- 
pelling performance. Yet the impression per- 
sists that he really knows the theatre as few 
others know it, and that he would write more 
worthily about it if it were more worthy itself. 
When the better day finally comes for the stage, 
let us hope not to find that the rather regrettable 
habits which Mr. George Jean Nathan has 
formed during times of decadence are operating 
to prevent him from writing about finer things 
in a finer way. For despite numerous incisive 
and clear-visioned pages, large tracts of his work 
are better suited to the passing feuilleton than to 
the permanent book. 

THE EVOLUTION OF MODERN CAPITAL- 
ISM. By John A. Hobson. Scribner; $1.75. 
The new edition of John A. Hobson's "The 
Evolution of Modern Capitalism" differs from 
its predecessor by the addition of a new supple- 
mentary chapter dealing with the effect of the 
war on the industrial organization of Europe. 
"The year 1914," Mr. Hobson writes in his 
preface, "will mark a definite break in economic 
as in other history. . . Never has any previous 
war exercised such a disturbing influence. . ." 



The disturbance has shown itself in England as 
a swift qualitative and quantitative readjustment 
of industry to new demands, an increase of pro- 
duction in spite of the withdrawal of millions 
of laborers from work, the "dilution" of labor, 
that is, an increase in the number of people exe- 
cuting a single process, and the employment of 
women at jobs hitherto taboo to them. Money 
wages have gone up, real wages are down, and 
the maintenance of the real wage level will de- 
mand, and in the end compel, cooperation be- 
tween labor and capital, such that workers may 
become in some sense owners. Against such a 
unification of the operators in an industry, how- 
ever, the consuming public will need protection, 
so that government regulation and control of 
prices and production may be necessarily con- 
tinued even when the war is over. This will be 
even more essential unless a durable and organic 
peace gets established. For nations will then 
want to go completely "heeled," to be self-sus- 
taining in every respect, the governments hold- 
ing a firm hand upon the manufacture of 
munitions and the production of food particu- 
larly. The war has shown, furthermore, the 
increased power of the public credit, which kept 
the banks from going smash during the first 
period. This may be now invoked to finance a 
"return to the land" and other enterprises having 
a bearing on national defence. Without inter- 
national organization, moreover, economic inter- 
nationalism is certain to be disorganized. Industry 
will be subjected to the control of military 
and political considerations. This will arrest 
economic progress, and make secure the grip of 
the financial oligarchy upon mankind. 

LOVE SONGS. By Sara Teasdale. Mac- 

millan; $1.25. 

A bookful of loveliness is this new volume of 
Sara Teasdale's verse : new not in the sense that 
all the poems it contains are recent ones, but that 
it represents a lately gathered treasury of lyrics. 
They are characterized, as her work has always 
been, by a musical facility, strong imagery, and 
that note of mingled joy and pain which haunts 
the moments of love, whether in its inception, 
its fulfillment, or its loss. Indeed the poet stresses 
so frequently the sweet ironies of what Henry 
James called "the great constringent relation 
between men and women," that as one reads 
many of them the successive poems lose some 
of their original keenness. Mrs. Filsinger is 
betrayed, too, by her gift for smooth and charm- 
ing lines ; she occasionally wastes fascinating tech- 
nique on a triviality which ends in vapor. Her 
lapses from technical excellence, as for example 
the rhyming of "love" and "enough," are in fact 
less frequent than her failures to give point to

otherwise lovely lyrics. Of them all, the "Songs 
Out of Sorrow" are her least achievement; they 
descend most abruptly to the commonplace, both 
in theme and method. Of the others, one beau- 
tiful and typical is "Lights": 

When we come home at night and close the door, 
Standing together in the shadowy room, 
Safe in our own love and the gentle gloom, 

Glad of familiar wall and chair and floor, 

Glad to leave far below the clanging city; 
Looking far downward to the glaring street 
Gaudy with light, yet tired with many feet, 

In both of us wells up a wordless pity; 

Men have tried hard to put away the dark ; 
A million lighted windows brilliantly 

Inlay with squares of gold the winter night, 
But to us standing here there comes the stark 

Sense of the lives behind each yellow light, 
And not one wholly joyous, proud, or free. 

AN OLD FRONTIER OF FRANCE. By Frank 

H. Severance. Dodd, Mead; $7.50. 

Mr. Severance is a specialist in his chosen 
field, the Niagara region during French discovery 
and dominion. He is painstaking and accurate, 
with an apparently vastly absorbent, orderly 
intellect, and if only he might have quickened 
his subject with a more human touch, the re- 
viewer could accord him unstinted praise. The 
story of civilized man's struggle with the wilder- 
ness, with savages, and finally with other civilized 
men is one of ever-renewed interest, reflecting as 
it does the evolution of nationality. 

Champlain, La Salle, and Tonti, "the man 
with the iron hand," in their laborious but relent- 
less progress westward, were not, perhaps, in- 
spired by the highest motives, but they were of 
the stuff that we can admire. Later, exploration 
was frequently but an excuse for profit in trade, 
just as trade was still later to become a mask for 
depredation, and national defence the byword 
for cruelties hardly exceeded by those of the shifty 
allies of the French in America. Dongan wrote, 
in the last years of the seventeenth century, " 'Tis 
a very hard thing that all the Countryes a French- 
man walks over in America must belong to 
Canada," and therewith demanded the "break- 
ing down" of the chief French stronghold at 
Niagara. The attitude that he criticizes was 
hardly confined to France. It might be applied 
with scant injustice to every man of whatever 
nationality who traversed the disputed country 
of western New York, the Lakes, and the terri- 
tory of "La Belle Riviere." 

Through the maze of bickerings and badly 
directed affairs, a few men of unusual power 
stand out. There was Joncaire the Elder, inter- 
preter by profession, clandestine fur-trader, and 
subtle diplomatist for the French in their deal- 
ings with the Iroquois. There were his sons, 
Philippe, of whom the Senecas wrote to the 



Governor that "they saw clearly their Father 
was angry with them, since he did not send back 
their son Joncaire, as that alone could tran- 
quilize them," and Chabert de Joncaire, that in- 
genious rascal who possessed a like power over 
the loyalty of his Indians, and who followed his 
term on the Niagara portage as "the greatest 
transportation monopolist in America," with a 
few years of not too solemn reflection in the 
Bastille. We read of such able opposition 
leaders as Colonel John Bradstreet and Sir Wil- 
liam Johnson, the conqueror of Niagara. The 
author quotes liberally from the caustic, often 
humorous old journals and reports. In his chap- 
ter on "Niagara News in 1757" he reflects most 
graphically the rough-and-ready existence on the 
frontier, when prisoners and scalps were brought 
in with daily regularity, when starving incomers 
were replenished from .the king's stores with little 
regard to the legitimacy of their disposal, when 
"ladies, women and children" lent an air of 
domesticity and gaiety by their unpermitted pres- 
ence. It was a good time to be alive. 

SOCIAL DIAGNOSIS. By Mary E. Rich- 
mond. Russell Sage Foundation ; $2. 
To make the study of human relationships as 
much a science as is the study of physical phe- 
nomena has been one of the dreams of the social 
philosophers since the days of the French en- 
lightenment. But the dream has never come 
true. While Miss Richmond in her careful 
work, to the preparation of which she gave the 
free time of fourteen years, has probably not 
had such an ambitious aim, she has produced a 
book remarkable for the accuracy of the methods 
outlined for the social worker and for the detail 
and thoroughness with which she has gone into 
the subject of measurements in one phase of 
life, the pathology of social adjustment. This 
volume is essentially a study in the methods and 
efficiency of case work. Cases are necessarily in 
large part individual matters and do not there- 
fore lend themselves easily to statistical study. 
Not the counting of instances, therefore, but the 
careful and painstaking analysis of human char- 
acter in relation to individual and social failure 
in all its angles and from all available sources 
in hundreds and thousands of instances difficult 
to classify has been Miss Richmond's task. It 
was a stupendous undertaking, but it had back of 
it the enthusiasm of one of the best-known and 
most able social workers of the country. And 
it needed badly to be done. How to get evi- 
dence, how to test it, how to use it are the 
problems she set herself to solve, and she has 
handled them in a way which has measurably 
advanced one aspect at least of social science 
toward the goal which the social philosophers 
have set for it.

IRISH IDYLLS. Jane Barlow. Dodd, Mead ;

When Miss Barlow's "Irish Idylls" was first 
published, twenty years ago, a critic said of it: 
"The philanthropist or the political student in- 
terested in the eternal Irish Problem will learn 
more from Miss Barlow's volumes than from 
a dozen Royal Commissions and a hundred Blue 
Books." To say more is futile. Miss Barlow, 
the daughter of the dean of Trinity College, 
spent her life in a small village just outside of 
Dublin; and narrow "Lisconnell," hung with 
peat smoke and mist, is not drawn from imagi- 
nation, there is room for a stranger at every 
hearth, where kindness, sometimes a bit hedged 
by sharp words, is commoner than potatoes. "A 
real poet 1 can never be," Miss Barlow once 
wrote to a friend, and went on writing singing 
prose. At the end of a wet day "the cloud 
canopy . . . was flying eastward, scudding 
in festoons and trails and shreds, or furled into 
rumpled bundles in the grip of the careering 
blasts. . . . Each arrival, mostly in the 
moth-colored dusk, at the black mouth of Dan 
O'Beirne's scarlet-hearted forge was a trium- 
phant moment to be anticipated from afar." 
And so on. But even if it were not shot with 
such lovely bits of description, every chapter in 
the book that one called "One Too Many" 
most of all is a gift to the student of Ireland. 

THE BUDGET. By Rene Stourm. Trans- 
lated by Thaddeus Plazinski. Appleton; 
$3.75. 

There are many reasons for regarding the 
management of revenues and expenditures as the 
most crucial part of government. The age-long 
struggle for democracy has hinged on the power 
of the purse; and, broadly speaking, political sys- 
tems succeed or fail according as they make pro- 
vision for honest and economical handling of the 
public funds. The United States has had her 
share of irresponsible and corrupt use of the 
people's money, but the chief difficulty has been 
rather the almost unvarying shortsightedness and 
wastefulness of well-meaning, but inexperienced 
or inefficient, legislators and administrators. A 
year or more ago certain students of govern- 
mental problems set up in Washington an Insti- 
tute for Government Research, with a view not 
only to scientific investigation, but to the develop- 
ment of constructive plans for administrative im- 
provement in the United States. Quite properly, 
the attention of this promising agency was turned 
first of all to the subject of finance. An admira- 
ble volume dealing with financial administration 
in Great Britain was published, and the excel- 
lences of the British budget system were duly 
emphasized. 



A second publication is no less important, al- 
though only a translation. The book chosen is 
Professor Stourm's "Le Budget," which for 
many years has been the standard treatise on the 
preparation of estimates, the voting of appropri- 
ations, and the collection of taxes. In France it 
has reached a seventh edition; and it is safe to 
say that no book has been more influential in 
bringing to their present high efficiency the finan- 
cial systems of the western European nations. The 
volume has been little used in America, except by 
scholars. It should now come into the hands of 
numerous members of Congress, state legisla- 
tures, municipal councils, and other spending 
bodies; and while, perhaps unfortunately, large 
sections deal on technical lines with problems and 
methods which are peculiar to France, the Amer- 
ican official who cannot find here a fund of in- 
dispensable information ought not to be in public 
office. Fundamentally, the fault in our fiscal 
administration lies with the people, who cling to 
the notion that the treasury exists for the satis- 
faction of local needs. It is too much to expect 
of the people generally that they read Stourm's 
lengthy and rather dry book. Yet through in- 
creased use by publicists, office-holders, teachers, 
and students it will undoubtedly become a force 
in the gradual reshaping of public opinion on 
more wholesome lines, thereby justifying the con- 
fidence of those who are responsible for its ap- 
pearance in its present form. 

A NATURALIST OF SOULS. By Gamaliel 

Bradford. Dodd, Mead; $2.50. 

Mr. Bradford's title sounds a bit pompous, 
but he has an authority for it no less august than 
Sainte-Beuve : "je suis un naturaliste des esprits." 
This phrase Mr. Bradford condenses into the 
word "psychographer," which, together with 
"psychograph," he has "not yet found courage 
to talk about, and even if I had, publishers and 
editors have not." Psychography is, however, 
explained. It differs from biography in that the 
latter "is bound to present an elaborate sequence 
of dates, events and circumstances, of which 
some are merely required to make the narrative 
complete," while "psychography selects only that 
which is indispensable for its particular purpose, 
i. e., the attempt to portray character." This 
difference hardly seems important since good 
biography has often succeeded in portraying char- 
acter with no neglect of the events of the indi- 
vidual's life. The word, together with the process 
it is supposed to designate, might be ignored 
were it not for Mr. Bradford's seriousness about 
it, and his feeling that it "seemed to sum up 
processes that have been rather vaguely employed 
before and to give them a name which might be 
useful in attracting the attention of the jaded,

overloaded American reader." The possibility of 
using the word "psychography" for that purpose 
is amusingly pathetic. 

There follow, then, ten essays nine on men 
and one on "The Novel Two Thousand Years 
Ago." Of the nine only three are psychographs 
in the finished state: those on the younger 
Pliny, Ovid, and Saint Francis de Sales. The 
other six, on Donne, Leopardi, Anthony Trol- 
lope, Burton and his "Anatomy of Melancholy," 
Alexandra Dumas, and Clarendon, are attempts 
made before psychography was "consciously 
working." The reader is grateful that it worked 
before it was conscious, for it is difficult to tell 
wherein the real psychographs may crow over 
their less dignified brethren. Mr. Bradford 
writes the sort of essay that is born of enthusi- 
asm and affection, the sort that keeps one from 
sleep and the dining-table. If you know the man 
of whom he writes, you are delighted ; if you do 
not, you wish you did. He is a humble and not 
unsuccessful follower of the great, unconscious 
psychographers, Tacitus, Saint Simon, Sainte- 
Beuve, and, though he is not mentioned as such,

THE EXPANSION OF EUROPE; THE CUL- 
MINATION OF MODERN HISTORY. By Ram- 
say Muir. Houghton Mifflin ; $2. 
Professor Muir's "Expansion of Europe" is a 
companion essay to his recently published "Na- 
tionalism and Internationalism." It undertakes 
to describe, within the space of 230 pages, "the 
sources and character of the great process by 
which, during the last four centuries, the whole 
world has been subjugated by the civilization of 
Europe, and its bearing upon the problems of the 
Great War." Naturally, there is no attempt at 
formal narrative; and while the recent stages of 
colonial development are dealt with most fully, 
even the transformation of the British Empire 
between 1815 and 1878 is disposed of in less than 
two-score pages. Emphasis is laid on the 
motives, principles, and methods of colonial enter- 
prise, and on the influence of colonial undertak- 
ing upon the national and international politics 
of Europe. The best portion of the book is that 
containing an analysis of colonial rivalries from 
1878 to the outbreak of the present war, 
although even here there is no claim to the pre- 
sentation of either new facts or unfamiliar inter- 
pretations. The world ambitions of Germany 
are very fairly stated, and one will perhaps find 
nowhere a better brief exposition of the Mittel- 
Europa scheme and its international significance. 
Elsewhere the author gives expression to his 
somewhat contemptuous opinion of American 
foreign policy. Perhaps he is right in saying that 
it is only the British fleet that has prevented the 



Monroe Doctrine from being seriously chal- 
lenged; but his cavalier characterization of that 
doctrine, in its present form, as "a haughty 
declaration that Europe has no concern with 
American affairs" is not warranted by the facts. 
The book may be read profitably by persons who 
desire a rapid resume of the colonial and commer- 
cial rivalries of the great powers; more serious 
students will find it of little value. 

MY FOUR YEARS IN GERMANY. By James 

W. Gerard. Doran; $2. 

Germany's recent remarkable response to the 
call for a seventh war loan, a loan of no less 
than twelve billion marks, gives timely emphasis 
to ex-Ambassador Gerard's assertion that the 
power of the empire is still unbroken, that "we 
stand in great peril, and only the exercise of 
ruthless realism can win this war for us." Real- 
ism in plenty will be found in his detailed ac- 
count of his four years in the country now so 
relentlessly at war with us, as with most of the 
rest of the civilized world. From the day of 
his appointment as our representative at Berlin 
to that of his departure from the German capi- 
tal with "a clear conscience," as he says, "and 
the knowledge that I had done everything pos- 
sible to keep the peace," he tells us the story of 
his diplomatic and social experiences; and trying 
in the extreme some of them must have been, 
though no suspicion of a whine jars with the 
sprightliness of these chapters of seriously mo- 
mentous personal and official history. Varying 
here and there the autobiographic style are sun- 
dry informing reports on such topics as Ger- 
man militarism, the Zabern episode, the causes 
of the war, the treatment of prisoners, commer- 
cial and economic conditions, war charities, and 
German hate. Personal observation rather 
than abstract theory underlies all these chapters 
and makes them well worth reading. 

THE BATTLE WITH TUBERCULOSIS AND 

How TO WIN IT. By D. Macdougall King. 

Lippincott; $1.50. 

Dr. D. Macdougall King, having returned 
after being "over the top" in the war against 
consumption, was impressed with the fact that 
those who fall do so because they do not under- 
stand why certain things are necessary. He had 
a score of years' experience in treating the other 
fellow, and then he had the years when he was 
the patient. He has written an unusually clear 
and helpful manual-at-arms for popular guid- 
ance. It is made clearer by the frequent use of 
simile, chiefly drawn from army life. He tells 
how the white cells of the body march to and 
fro in the trenches, and fall upon and destroy the 
germs of disease; but if the white cells are im-

poverished or overworked, they are unable to win 
a victory. "You are the general and their des- 
tiny lies in your keeping." The tubercle bacilli 
are weak, and easily overcome if rightly attacked. 
If they have become established, it is because the 
patient is ignorant, and he had better go to a 
sanitarium for instruction. The second portion 
of the book is devoted to home treatment. Since 
nine out of ten have the disease at some time, 
and since failure to recover may be charged in 
many cases to the ignorant kindness of friends, 
it behooves all to study the principles involved 
in the battle, and not to wait until they are 
attacked. Only one criticism is to be made on 
the material. Milk pasteurized at 150 degrees 
is deprived of some of its nutritive value. The 
approved temperature is from 140 to 145 degrees. 

MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF BRITISH NORTH 

AMERICA. Selected and edited by Katherine 

Berry Judson. McClurg; $1.50. 

Since eyes were made for seeing, and read- 
ing, . . such a book as this has not much 
excuse for being. In the preface the author says, 
"As in other volumes of this series, only the 
quaint, the pure, and the beautiful, has been 
taken from the tales of the Indians. Any one 
wishing pure ethnology, good and bad together, 
would do better to go to ethnological reports." 
The author then makes no pretensions to scien- 
tific appeal, and her readers will hardly find any 
literary interest in the hundred or so short, mis- 
cellaneous, and inchoate myths related from the 
legends of Canadian aborigines. Whether they 
are reductions, redactions, or translations does 
not appear. Neither is there any specific assign- 
ment of sources. The purpose of the book seems 
to be the entertainment of young people, but 
even for this modest design the sketchiness of the 
material and lack of developed unity leaves it 
inadequate. The photograph on the cover and 
several interior views carry the strong suggestion 
that here is a new variety and a rather clever 
one of railway advertising. 

THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF LEISURE. 
By James Peyton Sizer. Richard G. Bad- 
ger; 75 cts. 

This little essay with an attractive title calls 
attention to a serious problem in modern life, 
serious despite its leisurely aspect. It brings 
forth the important consideration that amuse- 
ment and recreation are among the prominent 
and essential affairs of men. Amusement has 
become a huge business. Leisure is in itself a 
value approaching the highest good. A success- 
ful democracy must make leisure possible for the 
largest numbers. It must provide ways of using 
leisure which will advance as well as content 



human beings. The statement made by Mr. 
Sizer shows how far from such a condition the 
actual relation stands. It shows, on every side, 
an exploitation of the need for recreation, and 
its vulgarization in cheap drama, dancing, mov- 
ing pictures, and "amusement" parks. The 
organization of leisure and recreation by the 
community is ably pointed out as one of the essen- 
tial duties of the true democratic state. 

WILLIAM DUNLAP. A Study of His Life 
and Works and of His Place in Contempo- 
rary Culture. By Oral Sumner Coad. Pub- 
lished by the Dunlap Society, New York. 
After a long period of inactivity the Dunlap 
Society has brought out a new book. This is evi- 
dently another of the dissertations on American 
writers into which the department of English at 
Columbia has of late been directing candidates 
for the doctorate, and it is one of the best of its 
class. Unfortunately, it falls occasionally into a 
cheaply journalistic style, which might well have 
been censored by the distinguished gentlemen to 
whom the author gives thanks for aid with the 
proof sheets. Like other young investigators, 
the author includes material acquired in the 
course of his study which, while new and inter- 
esting to him, is readily available elsewhere, and 
is not closely germane to his subject. Notwith- 
standing these faults he has done an exceedingly 
thorough and complete piece of research, and has 
prepared a sane and, on the whole, well-balanced 
book. The order and system of his presentation 
will be especially appreciated by those who know 
how completely Dunlap's own non-dramatic 
writings lack these qualities. He has steered 
well between the danger of overpraising the 
subject of one's thesis as a hero and that of 
shattering a traditional reputation by supercilious 
criticism. There is no gainsaying his judgment 
that Dunlap was an imitator rather than a creator, 
and that he had no high literary gift, but was, as 
pioneer and innovator, a force of the first im- 
portance. If Dr. Coad has not succeeded in 
making as vivid as might be wished the person- 
ality of a charming comrade and a likable ac- 
quaintance, this may be due in part to the paucity 
of materials at his disposal. The appendix con- 
tains a bibliography of Dunlap's writings, and a 
partial list of his extant paintings. 

THE OPPRESSED ENGLISH. By Ian Hay. 

Doubleday, Page; 50 cts. 

A book the Englishman could never under- 
stand. How anyone could find material for a 
satire in his dislike of "talking shop" and "put- 
ting on side" would be beyond his comprehension. 
But Ian Hay does and, moreover, he makes very 
good use of that material. He points out with

evident glee that in the present war, the English 
soldier, as differentiated from the Scottish or 
Irish or Canadian one, never gets the credit for 
any daring deed or victory at the front, but let 
something go wrong at once it is the muddle- 
headed Englishman who is blamed. Mr. Hay 
tells why he thinks this is so. In another chapter 
he gives the Englishman's "Secular Decalog" and 
a typical American's comment on it. He then 
proceeds to explain why it is the English cannot 
settle the Irish question. As is apt to be the case 
with a book of this kind, Mr. Hay's desire to 
make his humorous periods leads him sometimes 
to sacrifice the exact truth. He exaggerates the 
idiosyncrasies of the Englishman to make his 
satire carry over. Once you have forgiven that, 
however, you find the little book pleasant reading. 

ACROSS FRANCE IN WAR-TIMB. By W. 

Fitzwater Wray. Dutton ; 50 cts. 

Across France in wartime is exactly where 
and when many of the adventurous or the curi- 
ous among us would like to travel. Mr. Wray 
(Kuklos), out of a newspaper job because of the 
war and unfit to serve as a soldier, finds both 
employment of time and sufficient excitement in 
a bicycle trip across France from St. Malo east 
to Vitry-le Francois, the line of travel all lying 
south of Paris. The author is wise enough to 
realize the advantages of travel on foot or cycle 
advantages like those of closer acquaintance 
with the country traversed and of passage over 
roads inaccessible to an automobile. He gives, in 
a rambling way, the story of suspicious peasants, 
deeming anyone a Prussian who is not French, 
of broken homes, of the difficulty of obtaining 
food in short all the usual joys and pains of 
such a trip. If you are the sort of person who 
wants to know what is just around that bend in 
the road, you will enjoy Mr. Wray's story. 

LIFE AND TIMES OF DAVID HUMPHREYS. 

By Frank Landon Humphreys. Putnam's; 

$7.50. 

These two large and handsome volumes are an 
excellent example of what may be called monu- 
mental biography. They have been prepared 
with great pains to commemorate the life and 
virtues of a relative of the biographer; and 
printer, illustrator, and binder have combined to 
give them a form that is dignified on the library 
shelves. A casual reader with endless time will 
find in them much of miscellaneous interest, and 
the scholar may make use of them by means of 
the excellent index. A hurried student forced to 
read them through will do so with many groan- 
ings. The author shows his thoroughness by 
including every bit of information that comes in 



his way. For example, he thinks it probable, 
though he has no certain proof, that David 
Humphreys lived in Connecticut Hall, at Yale, 
in 1771. This justifies a two-page history of 
that building, with a quotation from a contem- 
porary mention of the laying of the corner-stone 
in 1750, and the added remark, "It is not stated 
whether the ceremony was a purely academic and 
social one, or whether the 'Worshipful Master' 
and his assistants were called upon to lay prop- 
erly the foundation stone." On this plan of 
telling all that is known, all that is conjectured, 
and all that is not known about the most irrele- 
vant things, the biography meanders along. The 
familiar story of Arnold's treason and the cap- 
ture and execution of Major Andre is told at 
length, to conclude with the statement: "The 
part borne in these transactions by Col. Humph- 
reys does not appear from any available docu- 
ments. But as one of the General's aides and 
a personal friend of Col. Wadsworth he un- 
doubtedly went to Hartford, where his knowl- 
edge of French was probably of service." Indeed, 
without the words "undoubtedly" and "prob- 
ably" the author could hardly have got through 
the first volume. 

In the latter part of the work more corre- 
spondence is available, and the facts can be stated 
more definitely; though of the letters given here 
two-thirds add nothing to our knowledge of 
Humphreys, and most of them have been printed 
elsewhere. All known facts regarding David 
Humphreys's life could very likely have been told 
in fifty pages, and all really significant parts of 
his letters and of letters to him given in one hun- 
dred pages more. Since the author has done a 
monumental biography so well it may be unfair 
to complain that he did not choose to do another 
kind ; but such a choice would have been a clear 
saving of 850 pages to the reader. Except for 
one or two slips that may be chargeable to the 
printer the work seems accurate and scholarly. 
It dwells especially on the relations between 
Humphreys and Washington, not only while 
Col. Humphreys was aide-de-camp to the Com- 
mander-in-Chief during the Revolution, but un- 
til Washington's death. It also gives full details 
of Humphreys's career as minister to Portugal 
and to Spain, and his efforts to clear up the Al- 
gerian complications. His later public-spirited 
devotion to the improvement of sheep-breeding 
and of the manufacture of woolen cloth are pre- 
sented fully, though less emphatically. Those 
who remember David Humphreys chiefly as one 
of the "Hartford Wits" may be surprised at the 
relatively small amount of space devoted to his 
literary work, though after the chapter of 
"Humphreys's Writings" little remains to be 
said.

NOTES ON NEW FICTION 



Any reader who has hoped that sometime he 
might have the opportunity to make the amende 
honorable to Edna Ferber has it now. If you 
have found yourself led along protestingly, how- 
ever divertingly, through Miss Ferber's previous 
writings; if you have had an uncomfortable feel- 
ing that perhaps your author did not quite respect 
her reader, her art, or herself, here comes the 
chance to change your mind, to alter your atti- 
tude toward one of the most up-and-coming of 
our present-day fictionists. "Fanny Herself" 
(Stokes; $1.40) is the most serious, extended, 
and dignified of Miss Ferber's books. Its first 
half, in particular, is quite the best work that the 
creator of Emma McChesney has done. The 
earlier stages of the career of Fanny Brandeis 
her advance from the small bazaar in "Winne- 
bago," Wisconsin, to an important position in a 
big mail-order house in Chicago is full of unc- 
tion, verve and passion. Molly Brandeis, Fanny's 
mother, who dominates this portion of the book, 
is even better than her daughter. Later on the 
author succumbs to that necessary but trouble- 
some thing, a plot. The head of the mail-order 
house shows himself objectionable, if not danger- 
ous; and a clever young newspaper man of 
Fanny's own race and own home town leads her 
to peace and safety. He rescues her from a 
career of business and business only, and aids her 
to realize herself as a woman and not as the mere 
head of a department an ending which the trend 
and tone of the story had seemed to threaten. 
"Fanny Herself" is a vivid, vital, full-blooded 
book ; dealing with "big business" and the ascent 
of a forceful and persistent race, it is more suc- 
cessful than some of its kind in avoiding essential 
offences to ideality and taste. 

In "The High Heart," by Basil King 
(Harper; $1.50), the heroine decides to live 
according to the principle that right will always 
conquer, and she is ever irritatingly sure of the 
righteousness of her cause, particularly when she 
engages herself to the son of a rich family who 
abhor the match. The head of this family, the 
"Great Dispenser," as the author wittily calls 
him, looks upon himself as the divinely authorized 
arbiter of all his children's lives. His self-conceit 
is sadly damaged when he discovers that his 
second wife, whom he loves with all the fervor 
of his sixty years, is faithless. She exchanges a 
promise of good behavior for his consent to the 
engagement of his son to the poor heroine, and 
then the latter immediately discovers that her 
affections are really placed elsewhere, so that the 
sacrifice is wasted. This book, by virtue of the 
author's perhaps unconscious talent for writing, 
just escapes being platitudinous. 



It is a pity that Phyllis Bottome should waste 
her efforts on intellectual cream-puffs. A great 
deal of the psychology in "The Second Fiddle" 
(Century; $1.35) is accurate; but where could 
such happy endings possibly evolve? And how 
could one lovely, normal girl be all but sur- 
rounded by a set of caricatures? Any romantic 
young lady could tell you at the end of the first 
thirty pages who is going to get the charming 
Sir Julian in the end. The effect is not lessened 
by a change of nomenclature a proof-reader's 
oversight from "Sir Richard" to "Sir Julian." 
It is not fair for Miss Bottome to subsidize her 
gifts to the Ladies' Market. 

"We Can't Have Everything," by Rupert 
Hughes (Harper; $1.50), is a misnomer, for the 
various personages get what they wish, and that 
is "everything." The book is a plea for quick 
and easy divorce. A lovely girl is married to a 
mere man. She is loved by an athlete. The hus- 
band, for his part, ties himself tightly to the bows 
and bells of a dancer. The wife, in defiance of 
her pastor's wishes, finally obtains her release, 
just as the athlete finds himself obliged to marry 
an actress of the movies already twice married. 
In the end the reader isn't sure just who is 
married. The whole, in its sly sex-suggestiveness 
and apparent frankness about ostensibly vital 
problems, is quite characteristic of Rupert 
Hughes. 

The war has put an end to the existence of 
many fads, but Mary Fisher deems some of them 
still strong enough and harmful enough to write 
a story about. In "The Treloars" (Crowell; 
$1.35), we meet the editor of a frankly anar- 
chistic literary journal, the newspaper worker 
with ideals (soon snuffed out), the woman who 
believes that home is woman's only proper 
sphere, the spoiled actress who likes being loved 
and does not mind making a slave of some sus- 
ceptible man, the angelic maiden who finally 
wins the only man after the actress dies, and 
two controversial old men. All the personages 
are suitably downhearted, but almost every one 
finds salvation in the war. What a godsend the 
war has been to lazy or unimaginative novelists! 
With it they can cut every Gordian knot. But 
even so, sending the offending personages off to 
war is certainly less cruel than killing them. 

Ethel M. Kelley's first novel, "Turn About 
Eleanor" (Bobbs-Merrill; $1.40), will attract 
the favorable attention of those who want an old- 
fashioned story about new-fashioned people. It 
is old-fashioned in this day of typewriter-made 
fiction because it is full of common sense and 
good workmanship. There is more than an 
amusing plot, there are real ideas in it, as well 
as flesh and blood and brain characters. The 
story concerns a group of young New Yorkers 
who, fired by the zeal of a young collegian, de-

termine to find a "worthy purpose" in life. That 
purpose is discovered in the adoption of ten-year- 
old Eleanor. Anyone who ever had a child or 
wanted one will follow the ensuing experiences 
with the keenest enjoyment. Eleanor spends a 
month with each of her foster parents in turn. 
Each of them tries to mould her character in 
accordance with his pet preconceptions and gets 
moulded himself! Miss Kelley knows how to 
tell a story and she has a sparkling wit. The 
book is the sort that one passes on to a friend. 

The scene of "Temperamental Henry," by 
Samuel Merwin (Bobbs-Merrill; $1.50), is very 
plainly Evanston twenty or twenty-five years ago. 
Henry is a boy of eighteen who falls in love with 
every girl he meets. For one tragic climax he 
starts out to New York City with the intention 
of seeing his present lady-love off to Europe, but 
meets a siren on the train who soon incites him 
to get rid of his last penny, with most humiliating 
consequences. The boy's violent introspections 
and his barometric self-conceit are both funny and 
pathetic. 

Twenty-five years ago, if a stranger travelled 
through the Kentucky mountains, he was as 
likely as not to be taken for a revenue officer, 
and be summarily escorted from the country or 
disposed of in some less gentle way. To-day 
the mountain children no longer hide behind the 
house at the sight of a "furriner," and coal, the 
railroads, and settlement schools have among 
them almost transformed the mountains to the 
guise of civilization. But there is still a place 
the other side of the divide from any railroad, 
where men who live a mile or two from their 
neighbors will say, "Law, hit's noisy enough fer 
me right hyer!" It is from these places that 
John Fox, Jr., draws the material for his new 
collection of stories, "In Happy Valley" (Scrib- 
ner's; $1.35). Happy Valley harbors a mission 
school where St. Hilda, its founder, has created 
a social nucleus for the mountain people, where 
they may send their "young uns" to get learning, 
and where they may go themselves for help. Mr. 
Fox takes the keenest literary enjoyment in 
telling his tales of shootings, weddings, preach- 
ings, and other mountain ceremonies among the 
people whose ways and speech he knows so well. 
The inspiration that he seemed to draw from 
those earlier days at the Gap, when the moun- 
tains were really what one imagines the moun- 
tains to be, is somewhat dimmed, just as the 
mountain character has acquired a veneer of 
outer-worldliness. But the point is that he sees 
below the surface into the real lives of his 
people, and that he enriches mere incident with 
the warmth that comes from an appreciation 
of the values from which it springs.

sented to his countrymen the German Kaiser as 
the true friend of peace, the ideal statesman, the 
genial family man and devoted scholar? Who 
never tired of praising the German system of 
government and spread far and wide the gospel 
of its perfection? Who wore upon his breast 
the Kaiser's decoration and boasted of the imper- 
ial favors bestowed upon him? Who spent 
Carnegie's enormous peace funds right and 
left hiring speakers, organizing pacifist soci- 
eties in our colleges, and paying teachers to 
go to summer schools all over the country prop- 
agating the doctrines of international concilia- 
tion? Who demanded government ownership 
of munition works in order to remove the most 
insidious militarist influence from American poli- 
tics? Who first fell upon the German professors 
after the outbreak of war and denounced them 
for their intolerance, their blind patriotism, and 
their undiscriminating allegiance to the Kaiser? 
Who permitted the militaristic trustees of his 
institution of "learning" to subject to a humiliat- 
ing inquisition in 1916 two professors accused of 
pacific leanings? Who permitted his trustees 
to pass and make public resolutions calling for a 
degrading inquiry into the views of the teaching 
force and then went South to play golf? Who 
drove out of his institution a young instructor 
who was one of his own paid peace propagan- 
dists? Who defamed and misrepresented two 
professors of pacifist leanings and called upon 
the mob to crucify them? Who has now flung 
aside his "convictions" on international concilia- 
tion and become the chief witch-burner and 
heresy-hunter in America? Answer: The man 
who occupies the exalted office of president of 
Columbia University. 



"YESTERDAY," WRITES A FRIEND OF THE 
DIAL, in Paris, "I revisited the city. It is 
changed beyond recognition. The houses and 
shops are of course the same, and Lahaye, mine 
host of the Cafe de Paris, as formerly, never fails 
to stir the ice at the bottom of his glass as he 
remarks, 'Here's another the Prussians won't 
get.' But Dessertenne and Develoy and all the 
ox and cow dealers of the countryside are down 
and out. .The Americans, now two months 
gone, hold the country. They came up, they 
looked it over, they settled down. They own the 
railway station, in spite of the station-master, 
whom they sent out to pasture politely. They 
own the streets, peopling them with camions and

automobiles and side-cars. They own the cafes, 
eating and drinking in them a la quick-lunch, 
without allowing anybody to waste their time. 
They own the fields; brick and iron barracks 
come up and cover the banks of the river. The 
drill-ground is theirs ; batallions drill from morn- 
ing to evening and entrain with an air that tells 
onlooking poilus 'Now, then, look sharp. 
They're at it.' And the women are theirs; I 
hear that the ladies look at them, lips puckered, 
and that all the young girls are dreaming of mar- 
rying Americans. But don't imagine the natives 
are angry at being jostled and shaken up and 
shoved out by this invasion. Oh, no! The abo- 
rigines hold a corner on it, if I may say so, quite 
closed up. 'Ain't they the rascals!' they keep 
saying. And when a Morvandiau deigns to call 
somebody a rascal, he's using, I assure you, his 
superlative of enthusiasm." 



HOW IS CRITICISM TO REMAIN INFALLIBLE in 

spite of the fallibility of the critic? The ques- 
tion is posed by a literary editor. In fiction, we 
are reminded, the critic's "great personal enjoy- 
ment" may be "excited to the highest degree by 
a Sherlock Holmes story, while 'Anna Karenina,' 
we will say, might leave him quite calm. And 
yet he would be perfectly honest as a literary 
critic in recommending the 'Anna Karenina' 
novel much more highly than the detective story 
and this in spite of the fact that he enjoyed 
reading the detective story much more than he 
did 'Anna Karenina'." The study of literature 
has furnished the critic with "perfectly definite 
laws" by which to distribute praise and blame. 
What a nightmarish possibility! The "laws" 
apparently enable the critic to regenerate his 
readers while leaving his own nature unregen- 
erate. Could there be a more irritating paradox ? 

THE LITERARY EVENT OF THE PAST FORT- 
NIGHT was, of course, the appearance of the two 
unfinished novels by Henry James. To the 
intrinsic interest of the volumes there is added 
the further interest of the workman's notes, 
swift jottings that trace the evolution of the 
theme and the successive modifications it took on 
under the eager play of his mind. To those who 
love letters, such intimate revelations are al- 
ways precious. Whatever one may think of 
the durability of the vast fictional structure 
James reared, a question we shall certainly 
hear tossed about in the next few months, 
there can be no doubt of his impressiveness as 
an artist. He was unique and he was inspiring. 
Glance at these hasty, and yet always fastidious, 
notes "the overflow into talk of an artist's 
amorous plan" and you are forced to realize 



anew how entirely James had brought all his 
powers to a focus in the task of creation. Every 
impulse was subordinated, every activity tribu- 
tary, to the main stream of his interest. The 
problems he set himself were never easy, and 
they were never slighted. He seems even to have 
delighted in accumulating difficulties as he went 
along, in an effort to reveal more and ever more 
aspects of the repercussion of moods and the 
clash of temperaments. He recorded copiously 
and with the merciless minuteness of a man who 
has all the time there is, and yet one sees that 
what he wanted always to give was the utmost 
truth possible never mere subtlety. The prize 
he set himself was, to use his own words, "to 
achieve the lucidity with the complexity." He 
didn't always succeed ; some of the complexities he 
saw or imagined could never have been made 
lucid ; but there is no doubt that he did his best. 
And he achieved in doing it a complete individu- 
ality as a writer. Such absorption as he revealed 
may seem a little idolatrous, inhuman in the wide 
area of experience it excluded, but it gives you 
the figure of the artist who is content to be that 
and nothing else. And such a figure cannot but 
be imposing. 

THERE is A CERTAIN RESPLENDENT MAGA- 
ZINE, published in the only "cosmopolitan centre" 
in these states, which has for its special care the 
fashioning of our nascent aristocracy. It is 
almost invariably patient and helpful, having 
regard to the rawness and stubbornness of the 
material with which it is condemned to work, 
and it can be informative on a vast range of 
topics touching the orthodoxies of the decorous 
life, such as hats, walking sticks, tea-table embel- 
lishments (including conversation), and so on. 
Literature and the arts are by no means over- 
looked. For example, "There are only two 
requirements for greatness in a work of art: it 
must set forth material that is momentous, in 
accordance with a method that is masterly. In 
the first place, the artist must have something to 
say; and, in the second place, he must know how 
to say it." Or again: "In any really great 
work material and method are so completely 
married that it is impossible for analytic critics 
to divorce them. The thing said and the way 
of saying it are one and inseparable. The genius 
of such supreme artists as Phidias, Dante, Velas- 
quez, Shakespeare, and Beethoven is identical 
with their talent." There are those who main- 
tain that a passion for the cliche is inborn, while 
others hold that it can be readily acquired along 
with the traditional culture. As long as the 
latter theory is not absolutely discredited, and 
tolerance of platitude remains the true mark of 
caste, our neighbor does right to persevere.

of the day, personal relations and his own books. 

Great as Mark Twain was in his books, he was

Diplomatic Days 

By EDITH O'SHAUGHNESSY 

Mrs. O'Shaughnessy is one of the few living writers 
who possess the rare gift of being able to put into 
words their vivid impressions of interesting people 
and picturesque scenes as was proved by the phe- 
nomenal success of her earlier book. "A Diplomat's 
Wife in Mexico." Again in these pages she takes 
the reader into her intimate confidence as she tells 
of men and women who have played their parts in 
changing the course of the world's history.

Everyman's Chemistry 

By BLWOOD HBNDRICK 

"Everyman's Chemistry" is a real chemistry book, 
giving a popular view of modern progress in a field 
of peculiar importance at the present time, and 
designed chiefly for those who declare that they do 
not understand anything about the subject. Notwith- 
standing the wide field which it covers, it is full of 
anecdotes, of cheerful philosophy, and of whimsical 
turns. Many industries and their development in this 
country are brought under consideration, and the 
effects of the Great War and the necessity for chemi- 
cal independence in this country are emphasized.

An American in the Making 

By M. E. RAVAGE 

As interesting as the best of novels is this story of 
actual experience a dramatic narrative of the trans- 
formation of an alien boy into an American. The 
humor, and the romance of readjustment ; the toil- 
some hardships, the stirring adventure, the inner 
struggles of the soul all are brilliantly depicted in the 
career as we follow it from the moment when the 
youth catches the vision of the New World, through 
the temporary disillusionment* in the slums, and on 
to the end when his dreams are fulfilled.

The Story of a Country Town 

New Illustrated Edition By B. W. HOWE 

A new holiday edition of a story which for years 
has held its place as one of the classics that faith- 
fully and imaginatively portray American rural life. 
Into this novel the author poured an abundance of 
that sane philosophy, and kindly satire which have 
made him one of the best-known journalists of the 
day. Illustrated. $1.60. 



BRIEFER MENTION 



To compare such opposite studies of feminine 
philosophy as Anna Walther's "Around the World 
with a Milliner's Needle" (Stokes; $1.50), and 
Margaret Sherwood's "Familiar Ways" (Little, 
Brown; $1.25), seems impossible; yet they have 
a predominate element in common, selfishness. 
Miss Walther, after achieving success in everything 
in her career except a marriage with her super- 
cilious adorer, turns petulantly from her selfish 
agnosticism to an equally selfish faith in Christian 
Science. Miss Sherwood dilates peacefully on the 
joys of detached bachelor existence where the 
question of bird species is second only to that of 
bulbs. Yet the first of these volumes is brilliant 
in color and vivid in movement; and the second is 
notable for grace of expression. 

It is refreshing in these will-o'-the-wisp days of 
spiritualistic gleams over quagmires of doubt, to 
come across a series of short, sincere essays in 
Christianity, which really indicate a thoughtful 
and wholesome outlook on present-day affairs. 
"The Other Side of the Hill," by F. W. Boreham, 
is just that. (Abingdon Press; $1.25.) 

The first element in physical slovenliness, ac- 
cording to H. Irving Hancock, in "Physical Train- 
ing for Business Men" (Putnam; $1.75), is weak 
feet, and the second is defective habits in breath- 
ing. Setting-up exercises are greatly aided by 
first training the muscles of the feet and chest. 
All the exercises advised by Mr. Hancock may be 
taken at home, and without special apparatus. 
His directions are made clearer by the use of 
half-tone reproductions from weird composite 
photographs, reminding one of pictures of Vishnu. 
The plain, common-sense general advice and com- 
ment is of great value to any man or woman, and 
would add to efficiency. 

It is doubtless because Thoreau devoted him- 
self to nature throughout the year, while most of 
us are campers and trampers only in the fair- 
weather months, that his editors like to group his 
writings according to the seasons. We have long 
had volumes of extracts from his journals bear- 
ing the titles "Spring," "Summer," "Autumn," 
"Winter." "Through the Year with Thoreau," 
by Herbert W. Gleason (Houghton Mifflin; $3), 
a new and attractive gift-book commemorative of 
the centenary year, gives briefer selections on 
the same plan, illustrated with half-tones from 
photographs which Mr. Gleason has secured by 
retracing for years the rambles of Thoreau in 
Concord and vicinity. Except for a pleasantly- 
written and sanely appreciative introduction and 
a very few footnotes, Thoreau and these pictures 
speak for themselves. The illustrations are worthy 
of the poet-naturalist in that they include not 
merely the conventional landscapes and "pretty" 
flowers, but less usual and less promising subjects, 
such as the skunk-cabbage, fungi, icicles under a 
bank, and the "sand-foliage" produced by liquid 
mud on the snow in the railroad cut. It is inter- 
esting to note how an art wholly unknown when 
the author lived that of photo-engraving aids in 
the interpretation and appreciation of what he 



1917] 



THE DIAL

wrote. It may well be that he would have dis- 
approved of a process with so large an element 
in it of the mechanical. But Mr. Gleason has put 
into his photographs as much of an artist's indi- 
viduality as the wielder of a camera can well do, 
and it is evident that in making and selecting these 
pictures he has been engaged in a patient labor 
of love. 

For those who are desirous of a handbook which 
summarizes in clear, if dull, English the traditional 
ideas entertained by liberals, "Religious Thought 
of the Greeks from Homer to the Triumph of 
Christianity," Mr. Clifford Herschel Moore's Low- 
ell lectures on the subject, will give satisfaction. 
Mr. Moore is professor of Latin in Harvard Uni- 
versity, and his lectures are printed under the ru- 
bric above set forth, by the Harvard University 
Press. They deal in succession with Homer and 
Hesiod, Orphism, Pythagoreanism and the Mys- 
teries, religion in the poets of the fifth and sixth 
centuries, the same in Athens of the fifth century, 
in Plato and in Aristotle, and the religious philoso- 
phies of their successors. In addition there are a 
clarifying exposition of the cultural relations be- 
tween Greece and Rome, a discussion of oriental re- 
ligions in the western half of the Roman Empire, an 
orthodoxly liberal survey of Christianity, and a dis- 
cussion of the influence of paganism on Christianity. 
The learning exhibited in the book is solid and un- 
imaginative, the style too much that of the class- 
room, dull but informing. They do these themes 
better in England. 

Mr. Thomas A. Joyce, of the department of 
ethnography of the British Museum, having given 
us previously two volumes on the archaeology of 
the Mexican and South American cultures, now 
extends his investigations with "Central American 
and West Indian Archaeology" (Putnam; $3.75). 
Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama, Mr. Joyce 
finds, have been influenced chiefly from the north, 
by the Mexican and Maya civilization, although 
at the southern end of the region there are evi- 
dences of southern influences as well. The Antilles, 
on the other hand, reveal only slight evi- 
dence of contact with the north and something of 
a relation with the mainland of Yucatan, with 
strong indications of southern influences. The 
volume is richly illustrated with specimens of Cen- 
tral American archaeological material. 

W. S. Williams, in a little book entitled "The 
Problem of the Unemployed" (Badger; $1), clas- 
sifies the causes of unemployment under the heads, 
individual, social, and industrial conditions. Many, 
of course, will object to this classification and wish 
to merge the second and third causes. The author 
himself does not separate them carefully. He 
places special emphasis on the effect of industrial 
conditions. The brief statement of methods of 
solving the problem in Europe is supplemented with 
suggestions for America. Here again one is struck 
with the failure to utilize standard discussions of 
this subject, for example, the programme of pre- 
vention presented by the American Association for 
Labor Legislation. As remedies he suggests edu- 
cation, industrial training, abolition of child labor,

prohibition of industrial disputes, sickness insur- 
ance, better labor exchanges, and the application of 
Christian principles to the problem. The brevity 
of the book prevents thorough discussion, and its 
failure to draw on the latest federal statistics and 
other well-recognized sources seriously limits its 
usefulness. 

Though not so announced on the title-page, "The 
American Public Library," by Arthur E. Bostwick 
(Appleton; $1.75), is a new edition, revised and 
brought up to date, of the original work published 
seven years ago. But the printing on the wrapper 
and a supplementary paragraph in the preface, pro- 
claim this fact. As a matter of mechanical neces- 
sity, no doubt, the revisions and additions have 
limited themselves to such changes as could be 
made, here and there, without requiring any con- 
siderable resetting or recasting of the pages, so 
that the former pagination is retained, except that 
two pages have been added to the index. The 
table of contents of the first edition has also been 
reprinted without change, though a few of its 
details do not apply to the new edition, and a few 
details in the new edition find no place in the re- 
printed table of contents. Among alterations made 
necessary by recent developments, several of im- 
portance arrest attention in the chapter on "The 
Library and the State." A useful list of American 
library periodicals takes the place of the old list 
of library dubs, and the statistical table of A. L. A. 
meetings is lengthened by eight entries. The excel- 
lence and usefulness of this the only comprehen- 
sive manual in its special field call for no com- 
mendation at this late date. 

Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch's latest book, "Notes 
on Shakespeare's Workmanship" (Holt; $2), is 
correctly named. The chapters are pleasantly 
written observations which retain the conversa- 
tional flavor of their original form when first de- 
livered as lectures at Cambridge. The author has 
brought together many of the important conclu- 
sions which Shakespearean scholars have arrived 
at during the past ten years. Thus, although often 
fresh and scarcely ever superficial, the volume 
appeals more to the general reader than to trained 
students of Shakespeare. 

Professor Warren K. Moorehead is known to 
archaeologists through his former work on "The 
Stone Age in North America." In his new volume 
"Stone Ornaments of the American Indian" (An- 
dover Press), he attempts to draw conclusions from 
the distribution of ornamental stones as to the di- 
rection of migration of the Indians. After investi- 
gating nearly 12,000 specimens of problematical 
forms in ornamental stones Professor Moorehead 
concludes that the centre of their distribution is the 
region Illinois-New York. If the Indian had come 
from the East, one would expect to find problem- 
atical ornamental stones in western United States. 
Since we do not, it is more conceivable that the 
migration was from west to east, and that the 
tribes which settled in the East developed these 
problematical ornamental forms as a separate cul- 
tural affair. The volume is beautifully illustrated 
and makes interesting reading.

American collectors are interested in the sale by 
Christie, Manson & Woods of London, England, 
on December 10, 11, and 12, of the first part of 
the collection of rare early-printed German books 
from the library of C. Fairfax Murray. These 
books were collected chiefly for their illustrations 
and are mostly in fine bindings. Included among them 
are five block-books. There are examples from 
the presses of Holland, Belgium, and Switzerland, 
all of which produced a typography and illustra- 
tion different from those of the Latin countries. The 
period included embraces the years 1465 to 1680, 
the first date being approximately the date of the 
block-books and the last that of the book contain- 
ing Rembrandt's etching to Jan Six's "Medea." 

The majority of the books are of the fifteenth 
and sixteenth centuries, but a few of the seven- 
teenth were included by the collector on account 
of their Diirer interest. The woodcuts are of 
remarkable importance and completeness, commenc- 
ing with the earliest xylographs that is, the "Apoc- 
alypsis," "Ars Memorandi," "Ars Moriendi," 
"Biblia Pauperum," and "Speculum Humanae Sal- 
vationis." The famous early German presses at 
Augsburg, Basel, Coin, Frankfurt, Liibeck, Mainz, 
Niirnberg, Strassburg, and Ulm are all well repre- 
sented, besides those of Antwerp, Gouda, Louvain, 
Bamberg, Briinn, Leipzig, Rougemont, Schiedam, 
Speier, and Zwolle. The collection contains many 
fine and important books from the Ashburnham, 
Marquis d'Adda, William Morris, Huth, Pem- 
broke, and other recently dispersed libraries. The 
second part of the Murray library, consisting of 
rare early-printed French and Italian books, col- 
lected chiefly for their illustrations, will be sold in 
the new year. 

At the same auction house on February 4, 1918, 
and the three following days, will be sold the Med- 
ici Archives, consisting of rare autograph letters, 
records, and documents, 1084-1770, including 166 
holograph letters of Lorenzo the Magnificent, the 
property of the Marquis Cosmo de' Medici and the 
Marquis Averardo de' Medici. Almost all of Lo- 
renzo's letters in this collection are addressed to 
Pietro Alamanni, Florentine ambassador at Milan 
and afterwards at Rome and Naples. The other 
papers are letters received by Lorenzo, and sent on 
by him to Alamanni for reference, copies of Loren- 
zo's instructions to other ambassadors or of their 
dispatches to him, the Florentine government's 
instructions to Alamanni, Lorenzo's letters to the 
pope and so on. Four centuries ago ambassadors 
treated official correspondence, that remained in 
their hands, as their own private property. About 
a hundred years after Pietro Alamanni's day, Raf- 
faello di Francesco de' Medici married Costanza 
Alamanni, and there is every reason to suppose that 
through this marriage, Lorenzo's correspondence 
found its way into the family archives and this 
explains how state papers of such extraordinary 
importance as the holograph letters chance to exist,

unknown to historians, in the hands of a younger 
branch of the Medici family which branched off 
from the parent trunk 600 years ago. 

The unpublished love letters of James Whitcomb 
Riley, the Hoosier poet, written to Miss Bottsford, 
an Indiana school teacher, now dead, mention of 
whose sale to Gabriel Wells, of New York, 
appeared in a recent issue of THE DIAL, and which 
were resold to a well-known private collector, have 
been sought by relatives of Mr. Riley. They got 
into communication with the present owner of the 
letters, and tried to purchase them from him. His 
answer was that he intended to keep the letters, 
but that he was willing to have relatives of the 
poet look over the correspondence and reach an 
agreement whereby some of the letters, containing 
things which ought not to be preserved, should be 
destroyed. Mr. Riley's relatives claim that no one 
except the publisher of Riley's writings has the right 
to print publicly or on a private press any of these 
unpublished letters. 

Three holograph letters of Charles Dickens have 
recently come into the possession of Mr. Wells. 
They are all addressed to Clarkson Stanfteld, 
marine and landscape painter and a friend of Dick- 
ens. One, dated April 30, 1844, concerns a dinner 
on behalf of a sanitarium for students and artists 
in which Dickens was interested. Dickens says: 

The dinner is to comprise the new feature of ladies 
dining at the tables with the gentlemen not looking 
down upon them from the gallery. It will be very 
brilliant and cheerful. 

A second letter, dated May 25, 1849, is signed 
"The Misconceived One." In part it reads: 

No-no-no, Murder, murder! Madness and miscon- 
ception. Any one of those subjects not the whole. 
Oh, blessed star of early morning, what do you think 
that I am made of that I should on the part of any 
man prefer such a pig-headed, calf-eyed, donkey- 
eared master's request. Says my friend to me, "Will 
you ask your friend, Mr. Stanfield, what the damage 
of a little picture of that one would be, that I may 
treat myself with the same if I can afford it?" Says 
I: "I will." Says he, "Will you suggest that I should 
like it to be one of those subjects?" Says I, "I will." 
I am beating my head against the door with grief and 
frenzy and shall continue to do so until I receive your 
answer. 

The third letter is dated January 9, 1844, and is 
signed "Philo Forecastle." It reads in part: 

I was coming up to you today, but was detained 
abroad until dinner time, swearing affidavits against 
a gang of robbers, who have been pirating the 
"Carol," and against whom the most energetic venge- 
ance of the inimitable B. is solemnly (and lawfully) 
directed. I think of going back to the Garrick, having 
received earnest invitations from the committee. What 
do you say? Umph. We expect every hour to have a 
Baby down here. If anything happens, while I am 
putting this in the envelope, I'll write the sex in large 
type outside.

LE GALLIENNE RARITIES 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Mr. MacKay's inquiry about rarities by Rich- 
ard Le Gallienne, on page 360 of your issue of 
October 11, was of special interest to me in view 
of the fact that during the summer I was forced 
to be concerned with the work of Mr. Le Gallienne 
in connection with the forthcoming little book on 
his poetry in the "Contemporary American Poet 
Series." 

The six items remarked are undoubtedly rarities. 
It would be presumptuous for me to think of add- 
ing to them as I am in no sense a specialist in 
bibliography. The reader not quite so expert, how- 
ever, might be willing to bear with some mention 
of publications almost if not quite so rare as those 
that Mr. MacKay remarks. 

I should by all means remark "My Ladies' Son- 
nets" (privately printed, Liverpool, 1887). "Vol- 
umes in Folio" (C. E. Mathews, London, 1888) 
is not at all a common acquaintance. "The Book- 
Bills of Narcissus" first appeared in 1891 and sub- 
sequently in editions in various other years. A copy 
of any early edition should be a prized possession. 
"Fifty Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam" (The Philos- 
opher Press, Wausau, Wis., 1901) and "The Beau- 
tiful Lie of Rome" (1900) are by no means 
common in the libraries of the country. Mr. Le 
Gallienne has been such a prolific writer and has 
contributed to so many different periodicals that 
someone else will doubtless be able to go much 
farther than I in answer to Mr. MacKay's question. 
Very truly yours, 

BENJAMIN BRAWLEY. 

October 18, 1917. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
Under date of October 18 I wrote with refer- 
ence to Mr. MacKay's inquiry in THE DIAL about 
works by Richard Le Gallienne. It happens that 
I have just received from Mr. Le Gallienne a let- 
ter bearing on some of the items in question. 

"My Ladies' Sonnets," and other "vain amato- 
rious verses, with some of graver mood," termed 
by the author "a very boyish production," was pri- 
vately printed in Liverpool in 1887. The booklet 
should now be very valuable. Peter Nansen's 
"Love's Trilogy," noted in some catalogues, was 
not translated by Mr. Le Gallienne himself, but by 
his second wife, Julie Le Gallienne; hence it does 
not properly come into a consideration of the poet's 
work at all. "The Beautiful Lie of Rome" was 
originally published in England. W. F. Mansfield 
published a small edition in America, in New York. 
A distinction might be made between "Love-Let- 
ters of the King, or the Life Romantic" (1901) 
and "The Life Romantic" (1900), the latter being 
the English edition of the former. Hunt and 
Blackett were the English publishers. The books 
are otherwise the same. Very truly yours,

NOTES AND 



It is not necessary to introduce John Dewey to 
readers of THE DIAL, nor to insist that his qualifi- 
cations to discuss the issue at Columbia University 
are unique. 

Sherwood Anderson, who puts his view of the 
American novelist's problem with the greatest can- 
dor, attracted wide attention with his first novel, 
"Windy McPherson's Son." His second novel, 
"Marching Men," was recently reviewed in THB 
DIAL. 

Margaret Widdemer is a young New York poet, 
whose books include "The Rose-Garden Husband," 
"Factories, with Other Lyrics," and "Why Not?" 

Robert Dell, with the present article, joins the 
staff of THE DIAL and will contribute a Paris 
Letter regularly hereafter. He is Paris corres- 
pondent of the Manchester "Guardian" and the 
"Burlington Magazine," of which he was formerly 
the editor. As his magazine articles testify, he 
writes on a wide range of topics. 

Richard Offner, during a long residence abroad, 
was closely associated with Mr. Berenson. He is 
now giving courses in the history of art at the 
University of Chicago. 

M. C. Otto is a member of the department of 
philosophy at the University of Wisconsin. 

William Lyon Phelps has been Lampson pro- 
fessor of English literature at Yale since 1901. 
His books include "Essays on Russian Novelists," 
"Browning," and "Essays on Modern Novelists." 



John Morley's "Recollections' is announced by 
the Macmillan Co. 

The ranch country of Montana is the background 
of "The Forfeit," a novel by Ridgwell Cullom, 
published by George W. Jacobs & Co. 

The graceful verses of Robert Silliman Hillyer 
have just been collected and published in book 
form by the Harvard University Press. 

Ginn & Co. announce a history of the years 
from A. D. 1250 to 1450 by Professor Emerton 
of Harvard "The Beginnings of Modern Eu- 
rope." 

A romance of the days of Louis the Bold is the 
gist of Clara E. Laughlin's "The Heart of Her 
Highness." G. P. Putnam's Sons are the pub- 
lishers. 

"Richard Cumberland," by Stanley Thomas Wil- 
liams, contains a critical estimate of Cumberland's 
dramas and an account of his life and times. It is 
from the Yale University Press. 

Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. announce what 
they believe to be the final "Leaves of Grass," an 
authorized edition which contains 100 poems not 
to be found in any other edition. 

Edgar Wallace, author of "The Twisted Can- 
dle," has come out with another detective story, 
"Kate Plus 10." There is a taking kind of 
humor in his way of putting things. 

The personal traits of our presidents from 
Washington to Wilson are set forth in "American 
Presidents," by Thomas F. Moran. It suggests 
the interesting question whether there is any one 



1917]

American type which makes the presidential chair 
oftener than others, and which traits constitute 
the ideal president. The Thomas Y. Crowell Co. 
publish it. 

The Rt. Rev. Monsignor Francis Clement Kel- 
ley, head of the Catholic Church Extension Soci- 
ety, is the Myles Muredach who wrote "Charred 
Wood," a book recently published by the Reilly 
and Britton Co. 

Lovers of the heroic will find cause for rejoic- 
ing in George D. Herron's "Woodrow Wilson and 
the World's Peace," published by Mitchell Ken- 
nerley. The President is glorified and the war 
raised to inspiring levels. 

The setting of "Anne's House of Dreams" sug- 
gests Miss L. M. Montgomery's own girlhood 
home the little village of Cavendish, Prince Ed- 
ward Island. The story is from the press of the 
Frederick A. Stokes Co. 

In "A Literary Pilgrimage in England," Mr. 
Edward Thomas reflectively contemplates the scenes 
amid which the literary men of the last century or 
so, lived and gathered material for their work. The 
illustrations in line and color are quite delightful. 

Stuart Maclean, author of "Alexis" (Appleton), 
has just been appointed director of music at the 
University of the South, Sewanee, Tennessee. His 
work as music critic was called to the attention 
of the university authorities, it is said, through the 
book "Alexis." 

Brothers of the Book, Chicago, are issuing a se- 
ries of literary monographs of high artistic work- 
manship, the first two of which are now ready: 
"Walt Whitman: Yesterday and Today," by Henry 
Edward Legler, and "Oscar Wilde: An Idler's 
Impression," by Edgar Saltus. 

Miss Amy Lowell's new book, "Tendencies in 
Modern American Poetry," published by the Mac- 
millan Co., deals with Edwin Arlington Robinson, 
Robert Frost, Edgar Lee Masters, Carl Sandburg, 
"H. D.," and John Gould Fletcher, as types of 
the trends of contemporary verse. 

An attractive little book is the Walton Advertis- 
ing and Publishing Company's brochure "The War 
Administration." The book includes a good por- 
trait of President Wilson and a picture of the Con- 
gressional Assembly that witnessed the delivery of 
his great war addresses last Spring. 

The vivid and true personal narrative of a 
young Rumanian immigrant in America is an- 
nounced by Harper & Brothers "An American 
in the Making." If one is conscious of a slightly 
hostile attitude toward immigrants, he will get a 
new point of departure in this book. 

One of the sure-to-be-popular books of the sea- 
son is Eleanor Gates's "Apron Strings" (Sully & 
Kleinteich). Miss Gates is busy now with a 
dramatization of her book, and when she isn't 
playwrighting or novel-writing, she is riding, for 
her interest in horses is more than keen. 

Brentano's are bringing out Alexandre Dumas's 
"The Neapolitan Lovers" in its first English trans- 
lation. Another important book which they an- 
nounce is Claude Farrere's "The Man Who 
Killed," the story of a remarkable incident in the 
life of a French military attache in Constantinople.

William Aspenwall Bradley, while making a 
horseback tour of the most isolated and primitive

George M. Cohan has just finished the drama-

Mary Roberts Rinehart (Houghton Mifflin Co.),

this season in New York by Winthrop Ames. 
The title will be changed to "Peter the Little." 

A new-thought novel called "Destiny," by Julia 
Seton, M.D., and published by Edward J. Clode, 
is eloquent with the beauty of women, the mag- 
netism of men, and the mysteries of love. An- 
other heroine who is "very, very lovely" with 
purple eyes, is Grace Lorraine in the novel of 
that name by Douglas Sladen, just published by 
Brentano's. 

A new scheme for making boys study who don't 
want to study relegates the teacher and her pointer

at the Perse School, Cambridge, England. The 
book is published in this country by the Frederick 
A. Stokes Co. 

Two college boys are the heroes of "From Job 
to Job Around the World," which has just been 
issued by Dodd, Mead & Co. In the spirit of see- 
ing the world "before being anchored by matri- 
mony" and with little but confidence in the supply 
of jobs to sustain them, they made the grand tour, 
and the account is none the less interesting because 
of a youthful egoism and naive sense of humor. 

The World Book Co. announce "Problems in 
Subnormality." The author, Dr. J. E. Wallace 
Wallin, is director of the psycho-educational clinic 
of the board of education of St. Louis. He has 
spent eight years in clinical study of children in 
institutions for the feeble-minded, epileptic, and 
insane, in public-school and university clinics, and 
in the organization of classes for defective pupils.

In a letter to "Poetry" Vachel Lindsay gives 
some interesting information about the "Samson" 
in his new book of verse, "The Chinese Nightin- 
gale and Other Poems" (Macmillan). Mr. Lind- 
say writes: "I attended a negro church when I 
was last in Chicago, and some of the spirit of 
the sermons we heard went into Samson; and 
the process of conversion and repentance is, I 
hope, an honest and reverent record of what hap- 
pened before us. 

"After coming home I heard a negro sermon 
on Jerusalem whose refrain every few minutes was, 
'Let Jerusalem be coming into your mind.' An- 
other day I heard, amid a general exhortation, 
this outburst: 'There was a Russian revolution 
yesterday, and my Lord is riding high.' 

"I have used these phrases, I hope, in the same 
spirit that they were originally uttered. The 
fundamental difficulty of negro sermon poems of 
this type is that there is a profound seriousness of 
passion in the midst of things at which the out- 
sider is fairly entitled to smile; and when a white 
man tries to render this seriousness and this humor 
at the same time, he is apt to be considered more 
of a humorist than a sermonizer. The negroes are 
perfectly willing to laugh a little on the way up 
to glory, and, unlike the white man, they do not 
have to stop going up while they laugh." 

Mr. Hartley Withers, director of financial in- 
quiries in the British Treasury, has written a little 
book, "Our Money and the State," which has 
gone into its sixth edition in England, and is now 
brought out here by E. P. Dutton & Co. In 
the preface he says: "The present war, by making 
us spend with such Titanic recklessness, has 
supplied us with a huge magnifying glass by 
which cause and effect are more clearly seen than 
in times of peace. The results of borrowing, in- 
flation of currency, and inequalities of taxation are 
seen at work now on such a scale that if we use 
the experiences of the war aright they may help 
us to better financial methods when the war is 
over." 

Dr. Henry van Dyke gives an account of how 
"On the Right of the British Line" came to be 
written and published : "Four of us were dining 
at the Athenaeum Club in London in February 
1917. One of the party was a young British 
captain who had been absolutely blinded and after- 
wards taken prisoner by the Germans in the 
righting on the Somme front. He was the most 
cheerful one of the party, and his narrative of his 
experiences was full of intense interest. When we 
went into the smoking room he said very quietly: 
'Look here, you fellows. I can hear from your 
voices that you are pitying me because I am blind. 
Don't pity me. Congratulate me because I am 
alive.' I urged him to write down some of the 
wonderful things he had been telling us. . . He 
wrote the story and I brought the manuscript to 
America and took it to the publisher. This is how 
Captain Nobb's book "On the Right of the British 
Line' came to be brought out here by the Scrib- 
ners."

The E,ditor 

is a weekly magazine for writers 

It is twenty-two years old. Those who conduct it 
like to think of it as a weekly visitor to ambitious 
writers, as a visitor who must not be pretentious, 
not dull, but friendly and helpful. Recognizing that 
writing may be an art. or a trade, or a profession 
what the writer himself makes it THE EDITOR 
tries to tell writers, so far as such things may be 
taught, how to write stories, articles, verses and 
plays, etc. One thing it does, in a way that never 
has been equalled, is to bring to the attention of 
writers news of all the opportunities to sell their 
work. News of current prize competitions is a 
weekly feature. Editorials on copyright and authors' 
literary property rights are frequent. 

P. C. Macfarlane says that THE EDITOR'S lead- 
ing articles, which usually are written by Charles 
Leonard Moore, are the best essays on writing being 
published today. 

THE EDITOR has a department devoted to let- 
ters in which successful contemporary writers tell 
of the genesis, development and writing of certain 
of their published stories. 

A yearly subscription (52 weekly numbers) costs 
$3.00. A four months' trial subscription costs $1.00. 
Single copies are 10 cts. each.

A Dividend in War 

Time for DIAL 

Subscribers 

When I purchased THE DIAL eighteen months 
ago, I believed there was in America a public 
which would support a progressive, independent 
journal of criticism. That assumption has been 
justified not only by the response of subscribers, 
but also by the splendid cooperation of the lead- 
ing thinkers and writers. 

The following letter from Professor John 
Dewey is but one of many inspired by the new 
editorial policy of THE DIAL: 

"Not only the Middle West but the 
country is to be congratulated on the 
development which is going on in THE 
DIAL. It is rapidly becoming a national 
influence, a journal to be reckoned with 
by those who think, especially because 
of its combination of honest informed 
book reviews with humane and pro- 
gressive social policies, and, not least, 
good writing, hard hitting, tolerant, 
straightforward writing proceeding 
from an imaginative vision." 

Now that THE DIAL is established editorially, 
the next step in its career is the securing of a 
wider reading public. 

It would be comparatively easy to secure 
increased circulation by means of advertising, 
but I prefer to spend that money in further 
improving THE DIAL. Consequently I am ask- 
ing the cooperation of our readers in doubling 
our circulation before January 1st. Attached to 
this letter is a scheme whereby each DIAL sub- 
scriber may benefit not only THE DIAL but him- 
self in this cooperation. 

MARTYN JOHNSON, Publisher.

BOOKS FOR THESE TIMES 

ALSACE-LORRAINE UNDER 
GERMAN RULE 

By CHARLES DOWNER HAZEN (j u *t ready. $1.25 net.) 

Author of "Europe Since 1815," etc. Professor of History, Columbia University. 

Belgium has suffered under our own eyes, but the earlier fate of Alsace-Lorraine lies in a period 
of European history which is hazy to most Americans. This book provides a brief and reliable 
account of the matter. It gives the facts upon which opinion may safely rest. It is mainly a study 
of the history of Alsace-Lorraine since its annexation by Germany, in 1871, as a result of a success- 
ful war, and is the only available treatment of the subject in English. 

THE SOUL OF THE RUSSIAN 
REVOLUTION 

By MOISSAYE J. OLGIN (Illustrated. Just ready. $2.50 net.) 

Explains the social, economic, and political developments that made the Russian upheaval inevi- 
table. Recounts the uprisings and struggles from 1900 and 1917, and surveys the economic classes, 
the political groups, the social and intellectual differentiations of modern Russia. The author has 
been for the last seventeen years in the very throes of new Russia. 

TOPOGRAPHY AND STRATEGY 
IN THE WAR 

By DOUGLAS W.JOHNSON, Associate Professor of Physiography, Columbia University. 
With some 20 special maps and numerous reproductions of photographs. (Just ready. $1.75 net.) 

An analysis of the topography of each of the most important theaters of war, together with a 
summary of the principal campaigns, pointing out how military operations have b en influenced by 
the surface features of the country. The maps and photographs are of remarkable excellence and 
interest. The book gives the reader a clear comprehension of the most important events in the 
War to date, and prepares him for a fuller understanding of future campaigns. 

OVER JAPAN WAY 

By ALFRED M. HITCHCOCK (With 85 illustrations. Just ready. $2.00 net.) 

An American layman tells what he saw of Japan, its people and institutions, and what he 
thought of them. The result is a delightful book of travel with much shrewd and humorous com- 
ment and observation. 

OUR DEMOCRACY: Its Origins and Its Tasks 

By JAMES H. TUFTS, Professor in The University of Chicago. (Just Ready. $1.50 net.) 

A book for the citizen and the prospective citizen. It is less concerned with the machinery of 
government than with those ideas and principles which the machinery is meant to serve. In tracing 
the origins of these principles it develops the pertinent materials of history, sociology and politics 
in a connected and untechnical fashion.

WITH LETTERS, PERSONAL REM-

TRATIVE MATERIAL 

Introduction by 
ALICE GERSON CHASE 

The entire career of this 
intrinsically American paint- 
er is here covered. Begin- 
ning with his early impulse 
to draw, or, as he used to 
express it, "to make pictures 
for books," it tells of his 
brief, unhappy apprentice- 
ship at Annapolis, his fail- 
ure to make a satisfactory 
clerk in his father's store, 
and the final achievement of 
the opportunity to study art 
first in Indianapolis and 
then in New York. The de- 
scription of his life in New 
York beautifully reflects the 
atmosphere of that renais- 
sance of painting in Europe 
and America.

Gandersheim, who, in the tenth century, while 
imitating Terence, as has been said, heralded 
Racine and was at all events the earliest of mod- 
ern dramatists ; Aphra Behn, the first profes- 
sional woman of letters in England, playwright, 
poet, translator, and founder of the realistic novel ; 
Aisse, the Greek slave transplanted to the Regent's 
Court at Paris in the eighteenth century, whose 
love story is one of the most touching in history ; 
and Rosalba Carriera, the Venetian pastellist and 
miniature painter, who counted among her sitters 
and friends almost every notability in the Europe 
of her day. $2.60 net

HIS LIFE AND POETRY, HIS FRIEND,

By Sir Sidney Golvin 



The wealth of material which now enables 
every side of Keats's brief life to be thoroughly 
known is distilled and clarified into a narrative 
and a psychological study of absorbing interest 
and of the most intelligent sympathy ; so that 
Keats, both as man and poet, is made to live 
with a vividness that is rare indeed and with a 
truth which the reader feels instinctively.

By Frederic J. Stimson 




"Now and then there swims into our ken, in 
Keats's phrase, like a new planet, some work of 
signal talent which clothes the dry bones of his- 
tory with the nervous and throbbing flesh and 
blood of vital romance and makes old times and 
old characters love again in the white light of 
truthful portrayal. Such an achievement is here 
to be credited to F. J. Stimson." New York

THE BIGGEST EVENT OF THE WAR 

Under Fire (Le Feu) 

By HENRI BARBUSSE. Translated from the French by Fitzwater Wray 

Eighth American Printing in Preit net, $1.50 

UNDER FIRE is the greatest literary sensation of recent years. Three hundred thousand copies have al- 
ready been sold in France. It was recently awarded the Goncourt Prise of 6000 francs the chief literary- 
prise of the world. Everyone in France and England is reading and discussing it. UNDER FIRE is not 
only the supreme book of t&ts war but one of the supreme books of any war. It is the war itself, with 
all its horror and heroism and terrific human significance, as it unfolds itself day by day to the consciousness 
of the ordinary man in the trenches. And withal, it is the most tremendous indictment of war that has 
ever been penned. 



"The strongest and grimmest book yet written 
about the war." (N. Y. Nation.) 

"It is epic in proportions. . . It reduces Mr. 
Britling's intellectual reactions to insignificance." 
(New Republic.) 



"The Supreme novel of the war. . . If any book 
could kill war. this is that book." ( London Obtervrr. ) 

"This picture of war from a new point of view 
. . . makes an unforgettable impression." (N. Y. 
Tim*..)

Diplomatic Days 



By EDITH O'SHAUGHNESSY 

Mrs. O'Shaughneasy is one of the fortunate few who possess the rare gift of putting 
into words their vivid impressions of interesting people and picturesque scenes as 
was proved by the phenomenal success of her earlier book, "A Diplomat's Wife in 
Mexico." Again in these pages she takes the reader into her intimate confidence as 
she tells of her many contacts with men and women who have played their parts in 
changing the course of the world history and have contributed to the interest and 
charm of diplomatic society. Illustrated. $2.00 

An American in the Making 

By M. E. RAVAGE 

As moving as the beat of novels is this story of actual experience. A narrative 
of the transformation of an alien boy into an American. The humor, and the romance 
of readjustment ; the toilsome hardships, the stirring adventure, the inner struggles 
of the soul, all are brilliantly depicted in the career, as we follow it from the 
moment when the youth catches the vision of the New World, through the temporary 
disillusionment* in the slums, and on to the end when his dreams are fulfilled. $1.40

it is full of anecdotes, of cheerful philosophy, and of whimsical turns. Many indus- 
tries and their development in this country are brought under consideration and the 
effects of the Great War and the necessity for chemical independence in this country 
are emphasized. Whether the reader be a business man, a housekeeper, or a student, 
he or she will find much interesting information relating to forces and matter which 
enter into everyone's daily life. Diagrams. Crown 8vo. $2.00 

The Victorious Faith 

By HORATIO W. DRESSER, Ph.D. 

Moral Ueals is) War Time 

What H. G. Wells has sought to do in his novel. 'The Soul of a Bishop.' to dis- 
cover and express the spiritual import of the world war, Horatio W. Dresser haa 
sought to accomplish by means of this collection of philosophical essays which he 
calls 'a book of Moral Ideals in War Time.' It is a question, however, whether his 
present contribution to the literature dealing with the human and spiritual side of 
the war is not of as great significance as Mr. Wells'." Lot Angelr* Tribune.

The High 
Heart 

By BASIL KING 

What you have often thought 
about America's coming into 
the war and her great re- 
sponsibility you probably 
have not been able to put 
into words. So Basil King 
has written this book for 
you. filled with your own 
hopes, your own pride. In 
addition to this, the author 
of "The Inner Shrine" tells 
a splendid story of Newport 
and New York, the romance 
of a girl loved by two men, 
one an ardent patriot, the 
other indifferent.

The Rise of 

David 

Levinsky 

By ABRAHAM CAHAN 

"A masterpiece of imagina- 
tive realism." say the N. Y. 
Tribune. "In its intimacy, 
its frankness, its multiplic- 
ity of detail, its unreserved 
baring of facts, motives and 
feelings, it is scarcely to be 
surpassed and not often 
rivalled in the whole range 
of literature. The 'Confes- 
sions' of Jean Jacques and 
the current personalia of 
Maxim Gorky come to mind 
as comparable with it, and 
so does Emile Zola's narra- 
tive of his early life. But 
not one of these surpasses 
this story of 'David Levin- 
sky' in its astounding con- 
viction of palpitating, naked 
truth." "A masterpiece of 
autobiographical fiction," 
says the Boaton Transcript.

Here is a man with the light of a new idea in his soul, and a human, smiling way of achieving 
it. He has friends, both rich and poor all sorts, who are attracted to the Idea. He has an enemy 
much more interesting than the ordinary kind who hate, for this enemy likes him. The author's 
uncommon group' of people, in delightful glimpses of London and rural England, work out a solu- 
tion of modern life which reaches a climax of spiritual beauty and power on a little island in the 
Baltic. Even in days of war, this man is a hero, for he gives his life for the good of the race. This 
is a finely told story and much more. ** o/- .

BENEFITS FORGOT 

By HONORE WILLSIE 

Author of "Lydia of the Pines," etc. 

Every man in the Service should own a copy of this 
true story of Lincoln and Mother Love. It tells of 
a young army surgeon in the Civil War who repaid 
with neglect his mother's patient devotion. How his 
thoughtlessness was rebuked by the personal inter- 
vention of President Lincoln, and how he came to 
realize his ingratitude, make the rest of a deeply 
touching story. A good book to slip into the Christ- 
mas box of the boy at camp. Illustrated. Cloth,

GRENSTONE POEMS

Author of "Young Harvard," etc. 

For lovers of poetry a beautiful volume which the

wrought, more instinct with genuine flashes of lyric 
beauty, subjective in the best traditional manner of 
English verse, than any collection produced since 
the present revival of poetry came into being." Cloth,

THE HEART OF O SONO SAN 

By ELIZABETH COOPER 

Author of "My Lady of the Chinese Courtyard," etc. 

What "My Lady of the Chinese Courtyard" did 
for the women of China, this book does for the 
women of Japan, in picturing the intimate daily 
life within the courtyards of ancient Nippon. It is 
the story of a true Japanese woman, from girlhood 
through womanhood, picturing her life of self- 
sacrifice and submission to the stern precepts of 
Old Japan. Only Lafcadio Hearn has written with 
the same penetrating vision here displayed by Mrs. 
Cooper. SI illustrations in soft duotone. Cloth, Svo,

Realism in Prose Fiction 



Prose fiction is the vehicle par excellence 
for a realistic ideal. But I wish to call 
special attention to a somewhat embar- 
rassing feature of the realistic technique 
of nearly all prose fiction, further to sug- 
gest a method not a wholly new one 
for the development of a fictional technique 
that differs materially from the normal, 
excelling it, in my opinion, in its purely 
psychological possibilities. If one rum- 
mages in his memory of short stories and 
novels, such of them as can be fairly 
conceded to strive for realism, he will, I 
believe, be prepared to admit the justice of 
a somewhat unexpected thesis, that those 
succeed best in giving a sense of the flow 
and depth of life, in attaining both outer 
and inner realism, that do with the smallest 
number of essential characters, or, to put 
it rather differently, that do not attempt 
to individualize all the characters with 
equal care. The thesis will not hold rig- 
orously, to be sure, but in a large way it 
undoubtedly possesses much truth. In the 
measure that it is sound, it is merely the 
symptom of a wider principle, which we 
shall define in a moment. 

What gives a play its power of realistic 
illusion? Evidently the simple fact that 
the action and dialogue are directly re- 
vealed to us, not left to the imagination. 
This means that we can readily identify 
ourselves with the various characters as 
they follow one another. Being passive 
spectators, our minds work kaleidoscopi- 
cally without serious effort, without too 
great an exercise of creative imagination. 
The drama is predigested food. For the 
lyric poem a greater degree of creative 
imagination is required of the reader. He 
must identify the mood of the poem with 
a potential mood of his own. As a rule, 
he is aided in this task by the singleness 
of the mood represented. Economy of 
attention makes for strength and vividness 
of mood-realization. Thus, the essential 
technique of both the drama and the lyric 
makes it a simple matter for us to live 



through the experiences that the artist 
aims to have us feel and sense with him. 

What are the tacit assumptions in fic- 
tion ? Generally speaking, the writer does 
not identify himself, and through himself 
the reader, with a central character alone 
but claims an unconditional omniscience. 
He enters with equal freedom into the psy- 
chic privacy of all his characters. His 
outlook upon the events and motives that 
comprise the narrative seems to be directed 
now by one of his characters, now by 
another. This conventional omniscience 
of the author's goes by the name of objec- 
tivity. It is a power that the reader is 
supposed to share with him; indeed, it is 
considered so much of a sine qua non in 
the art of story-telling that it can hardly 
be said to be generally recognized as a 
tacit assumption at all. The reader, at 
the mercy of his omniscient guide, turns 
one imaginative somersault after another. 
Hardly has he ensconced himself with 
some degree of comfort in the head and 
heart of one individual, hardly has he 
begun to feel the warmth of vicarious 
self-consciousness, when he is mercilessly 
bundled out of his retreat and required to 
take up new quarters. Incidentally he is 
asked to cut his former self dead, at any 
rate to exhibit no more than a purely 
external acquaintance with him. Needless 
to say, he may be called upon at any 
moment to race back into his old skin, or 
even to adopt a third alias, a fourth in- 
deed, there is no limit to the demands 
made upon his reincarnative capacity but 
the charity of the writer. All this makes 
good gymnastics for the reader, and he 
develops a flexible, bouncing multi-person- 
ality that keeps him ever alert. There is 
not one of us who has not rejoiced in the 
exhilaration of the exercise. 

But let us not forget that the test of a 
truly realistic technique is the relative ease 
with which the reader or hearer or spec- 
tator can be made to live ^ through the 
experiences, thoughts, feelings of the 



504 



THE DIAL 



[November 22 



characters. He must himself be these 
personalities and develop as them. In the 
drama, as we have seen, this self-identifica- 
tion with a number of personalities is 
rendered a comparatively easy matter by 
the very nature of dramatic technique. In 
fiction, however, it requires a more distinct 
effort of the imagination to project oneself 
into a character's soul life. To do this for 
several characters and to shift rapidly 
about from one psyche to another may 
be fatiguing. More than that, it is, psy- 
chologically considered, a not altogether 
convincing procedure. Once we have iden- 
tified ourselves with a definite personality, 
our imaginative pride demands, provided 
always that the artist can hold our interest, 
that we be left to the isolation imposed by 
our new shell, that we watch the progress 
of events from our own point of vantage 
and follow the psychic lives of the other 
characters, not as revealed by themselves, 
but as affecting or as reflected in the soul 
that we have made our own. If the artist 
chooses to impose this limitation on the 
narrative form, two things inevitably re- 
sult. The arena crowded with significant 
characters, one of the features of the older, 
romantic and semi-realistic, types of fiction, 
becomes an impossibility. It is significant 
of a striving for a subtler understanding 
of reality that modern fiction has, on the 
whole, progressively moved away from 
this crowding of the arena. Further, the 
degree of individualization of the charac- 
ters needs to be carefully shaded. It will 
not do to bring them all into the foreground, 
for that would belie our naive outlook on 
our environment. The self stands strong- 
est in the light. Further removed are a 
small number of individualities whose lives 
are closely interwoven with that of the self 
but whose inner experiences can only be 
inferred, sometimes truly (that is, in a 
manner roughly coinciding with the view- 
points of their own selves), more often 
mistakenly. Still further removed are a 
larger number of personalities whose inner 
life is of little or no consequence to the 
central self, whose only function is to lend 
dash and color to the stream of daily 
experience that makes up the outer life of 
this self. And in the dim background bob 
up and down the merest ghosts of psychic 
entities, pale gleams, fragments of a sug- 



gested multitudinous world beyond. So we 
are fated by self-consciousness and the 
limitations of attention to live our life. 
So we may be made to live an imagined 
world at the artist's bidding. This psychic 
perspective is of greater importance than 
the unity of plot and the rest of the aca- 
demic requirements of literary art. For 
want of it many a well-conceived 
narrative, excellently motivated, proves 
"jumbly." In a picture everything is 
illumined by a single light that has direc- 
tion. We would not think much of an 
exterior in which the central figure is lit 
up by daylight that runs counter to several 
subordinate daylights showing up the rest 
of the group. Vet we do not seem to have 
developed a very keen sense of the value 
of the strict analogue in literary art of 
consistent lighting a self-consciousness 
that sets all the elements of inner and 
outer life in comprehensible, livable rela- 
tions. Singleness of outlook by no means 
limits the writer to the short story or to 
labors of unambitious scope. Indeed, one 
of the works which seem best to answer to 
our ideal, though it has not by any means 
altogether eliminated cross-lights, is a 
prose epic in ten volumes "Jean-Chris- 
tophe." 

At this point the reader may object that 
while this method pretends to be sweep- 
ingly realistic, to aim to grasp a bit of 
life and imprison it in narrative form, it 
yet is the merest subjectivism, an egoist's 
dream in which everything is hopelessly 
out of plumb, in which the valid relations 
of the objective world are badly muddled. 
Nor would he be altogether wrong. And 
yet, what is life, as we really and individ- 
ually know it, but precisely "an egoist's 
dream in which the valid relations of the 
objective world are badly muddled"? 
Objectivity, one might say, is romance. 
But he would need to add that we crave 
and demand this romantic objectivity, this 
mad seeing of things "as they really are," 
and that the literary artist has therefore 
a perfect right to choose between rigorous 
realism, the method that is frankly sub- 
jective, and objective realism, the romance 
of reality. There is, indeed, always room 
for the narrative embodying more than one 
psychological viewpoint, For the "cross- 
light" technique. Some of us, however,

will continue to look upon the subjective, 
or better "single-light," technique as the 
more subtle and aesthetically satisfying. 

Yet it is at least possible to combine the 
peculiar advantages of these two con- 
trasting techniques by the use of a third 
method of realistic representation. Look 
at the three human beings seated around 
a dinner table, nibbling at jejune bits of 
conversation. If you and I, like the psy- 
chologist of the behaviorist persuasion, 
merely described what we saw and heard, 
the reader of our story would not thank 
us. Insipid twaddle he would call it, for 
all our pains. If we identify ourselves 
with the host and take the reader into our 
confidence, revealing to him the stormy 
soul life hurtling along under the placid 
surface of conventional table talk, he 
would begin to feel interested. Yet he 
might tire of so purely one-sided, so 
merely subjective an interpretation of what 
was happening at the dinner table. On 
the other hand, if we identify ourselves 
now with the host, now with the hostess, 
now with the guest, pretending omnis- 
cience, some of us get restive, say 
"jumbly," and talk of cross-lights. What 
if we tell it all three times as seen, heard, 
and felt by the host, by the hostess, and by 
the guest? Should we not succeed in 
being subjective in three different ways, in 
other words, in being objective? For may 
not objectivity be defined as the composite 
picture gained by laying a number of sub- 
jectivities on top of one another, the most 
romantic of all wish-fulfilments, the suc- 
cessive jumping out of our skin in as many 
distinct manners as we fancy? Thus we 
reclaim the gift of omniscience that we had 
modestly discarded for the "one-light" 
technique, but with a difference. Before, 
we let our nine lives out of the bag all at 
once, now we live them in succession. 

The reader will not fail to have ob- 
served that we are not dealing with an 
altogether novel literary device. It is as 
old as "The Ring and the Book" and has 
latterly been the subject of experiment at 
the hands of Arnold Bennett and Joseph 
Conrad. Yet I doubt if the tremendous 
possibilities of "The Ring and the Book" 
method for the conveyance of a certain 
attitude toward realism have been clearly 
recognized. The method is of far greater 



significance than as a more or less interest- 
ing technical device; it is one of the major 
approaches to a profound and all-embrac- 
ing realistic art. It sacrifices neither the 
depth, the inner truth, of subjective real- 
ism, nor the external completeness of 
motivation of objective realism. It unites 
the two in a new synthesis of boundless 
resources. As a method for the artistic 
presentation of ideas and the analysis of 
life, it is bound to come into its own and 
reap a large harvest. That it can never 
become the method of narrative fiction is 
obvious, if only because it violates what 
we may call, with apologies to the jargon 
of the economists, the law of diminishing 
returns in narrative interest. Let us ac- 
quaint ourselves with some of its implica- 
tions. 

One thing is obvious enough. This 
method of varied repetition makes some- 
what serious demands on the technical 
ability of the writer. Mere repetition of 
incident and dialogue with appropriate 
variations in motivation is out of the ques- 
tion. No mere human beings would long 
tolerate the resulting dulness, were they 
animated by the best of wills. One of the 
great tasks of the literary craftsman work- 
ing with the normal narrative technique is 
to make a satisfactory synthesis of the dis- 
parate elements of character, incident, 
and motive- that go to make up his story. 
He is always fearful lest he fail, explicitly 
or implicitly, to arrange his materials so 
as to bring out his point with maximum 
effect. The weaving of threads becomes 
an obsession with him. In our suggested 
method of repetition, however, the threads 
need rather to be unraveled. The total 
material to be put before the reader must 
be distributed, with naturalness and nicety, 
among the successive versions. In this way 
each version brings something new with 
it, while the actual repetitions must be 
charged with ever-changing significance. 
Needless to say, the arrangement of ver- 
sions would normally be such as to pro- 
duce the effect of cumulative energy, 
of a steadily growing comprehension of 
the meaning of the whole. Like all induc- 
tive processes, the method requires a high 
degree of mental alertness in the reader, 
an alertness that finds its reward in the 
fulness of realization finally attained.

Attention may be called to a further techni- 
cal feature of interest. In the usual 
narrative it is always difficult, sometimes 
impossible, to avoid explicit analysis of 
character and motive. Even when we 
cordially like such analysis, we cannot 
altogether ward off a sneaking irritation 
at the disturbing influence it exercises on 
the flow of the narrative. Our method 
reduces the necessity of explicit analysis 
to a minimum. The tacit comparison of 
even two skilfully constructed versions 
gives opportunity for a wealth of implica- 
tions, many of which would need express 
mention in a single version. We gain a 
perspective of motive as we pass from one 
subjective viewpoint to another, just as we 
gain our knowledge of space relations by 
shifting the angle from which we look at 
a number of objects. 

There are many other interesting corol- 
laries of the method. There is one in 
particular that should appeal mightily as 
opening up exquisite possibilities of a 
purely aesthetic order. We have all of us 
often observed the peculiar individuality 
that a specific light lends an object. A 
house is not the same thing in the chilly 
gray of dawn, in the blazing light of a 
clear noon, in the soft glow of sunset; it 
is not the same thing under a hard winter 
sky as in the hazy warmth of summer. 
Each version of a repeated story is doubly 
subjective. The focal character brings 
with him not merely a psychic perspective, 
a centre of motivation, he brings with him 
also a temperament and a mood. His 
version receives an emotional atmosphere 
all its own. As we pass from one version 
to another, we not only shift our stand- 
point, we also attend in a different mood. 
This feature of change of emotional 
approach can be utilized to give the most 
profound, the most poignant interpreta- 
tions of life. One and the same series of 
events may be apperceived in varying, even 
contradictory, manner as a merry jest, a 
tragedy, a clever play of circumstance, an 
irritating bungle. 

Need one say that in the promised land 
is displayed a signboard bearing the fol- 
lowing inscription, in letters writ large: 
"Tinkers beware. Only artists allowed" ?

The Structure of Lasting Peace 
II 

THB "PRINCIPLE OF NATIONALITY": NATIONAL- 
ITY AND SOVEREIGNTY 

By and large, nationality is the integra- 
tion of the successive and permanent ele- 
ments of group life, as personality is the 
integration of the successive and perma- 
nent elements of individual life. It is as 
useless to seek any irreducible differentia 
of the one as of the other. Controversy 
about the nature and constituents of na- 
tionality goes on, as controversy goes on 
about the nature and constituents of per- 
sonality. Both dissolve under analysis; 
both are the most potent of dynamics in 
the making of history, which is their rec- 
ord. And it is upon the observation of 
the conditions and workings of this fact, 
and this alone, that a programme of last- 
ing peace can successfully base itself. Na- 
tionality, then, is to the group what 
personality is to the individual: tradition 
is its memory, custom its habits, history 
its biography, language, literature, the 
arts, religion, its mind. Together these 
form its culture, and culture in the nation- 
ality is character in the individual. Dur- 
ing the nineteenth century one European 
people after another achieved nationality 
simply by becoming conscious for the first 
time, or by recalling afresh and cherishing, 
these items of its being, the Greeks, the 
Italians, the Germans, the various Balkan 
peoples subject to Turkey, the Hungarians 
and the Slavic races subject to Austria, 
the Norwegians, the Walloons and Flem- 
ings of Belgium, and the Finns and Ukrai- 
nians in Russia. The Jews have been its 
great exemplification from the days of 
Titus, the Irish since Cromwell's time, the 
Poles from the date of the final partition 
of Poland. 

To-day there is hardly a single society 
of men in Europe, who share in the same 
memories and customs and speech, that 
has not established its nationality, and de- 
manded for it freedom and opportunity. 
Where democracy prevailed the establish- 
ment took place spontaneously, as the ef- 
fect of freedom; in lands with tyrannical 
governments it eventuated as resistance to 
oppression under democratic inspiration.

So deep-lying is it in the funded mentality 
of the human families of Europe, that it 
has become the governing concept in a 
theory of civilization and a programme of 
life. The democratic prophet of this the- 
ory is the great Mazzini; its dynastic 
promulgators are Nietzsche, Chamberlain, 
Treitschke, von Biilow. The latter formu- 
late it in a mythology of race, and provide 
metaphysical and moral sanctions for Ger- 
man imperialism; their work, indeed, is an 
admirable instance of how a fact, con- 
verted into a "principle" and applied con- 
sistently and regardlessly, may become its 
own bitterest enemy. 

Against this German misapplication of 
the "principle of nationality" the demo- 
cratic powers oppose their own sounder 
formulation. How it applies to the pres- 
ent situation, its needs and demands, they 
have not said. What does it offer the so 
diverse nationalities that are the popula- 
tion of Europe? Which of the various 
components of nationality does it acknowl- 
edge as definitive? What must it safe- 
guard and reenforce? What repress or 
extirpate? The Allies' declarations yield 
no answer to these questions. They only 
deny the claims of imperialism, and those, 
only when they are German. But what 
is the relation of the "principle of nation- 
ality" to the imperialisms, if there be 
such, of England, or France, or Italy, or 
Russia, or the United States? 

To ask such a question, any realpoliti- 
ker will say, is folly. The "principle of 
nationality" will mean at any peace con- 
ference only what the victors will let it 
mean, nothing more. But there are these 
other determinants of its meaning, never- 
theless the wishes and demands of the 
various nationalities; the implications and 
requirements of the fact of nationality as 
that appears as a force and a hope in the 
natural history of mankind. A lasting 
peace can rest only upon the harmony of 
all else with the latter. Now the least 
that can be said about the latter is that 
the association invoked in nationality is 
so peculiarly intimate as to command and 
demand the highest degree of loyalty and 
self-sacrifice from the associates. So in- 
timate is the association that, in spite of 
both criticism and evidence, the idea that 



the basis of nationality is race, community 
of blood and ancestry, is shared by both 
democrats and dynasts. It has its propa- 
ganda even in America, in the archaeolog- 
ical romancing of Mr. Madison Grant 
and the fictional eugenics of Mr. Seth 
Humphrey. 

Scientific anthropology discounts the 
whole conception, but there is envisaged in 
it at least this fact that the claim of any 
large association of men to consanguinity 
is an indubitable sign of a wakeful sense 
of nationality. Common ancestry is in- 
dicated in the word itself, wa/io-nality, but 
purity of stock can obviously not be the 
basis of it. How diverse stocks, associat- 
ing together, fuse through marriage, and 
become of "one" blood, cannot be said. 
Nationality falls between race and other 
more external forms of associative unity. 
That racial quality underlies it and is near 
to it, must be granted, but it is false that 
racial quality is identical with it. Asso- 
ciation may spring from the original and 
inward nature of men, from the instinct of 
the herd, from a hereditary or constitu- 
tional like-mindedness ; it may derive from 
the need of defence and offence in an un- 
favorable environment; it may rest upon 
both. Association of the first order is 
natural, internal; of the second order, ex- 
ternal, artificial. The difference is as the 
difference between time and space. Thus, 
a man may change his surroundings; he 
cannot change his past. That is inalter- 
able, and he is what he is because that is 
what that is. To abolish that, he would 
have to abolish himself. He may, for ex- 
ample, be at the same time an Irishman, 
a son, a father, an uncle, a cousin, a citi- 
zen, a church-member, a lawyer, a Repub- 
lican, and a capitalist. Each of these words 
signifies a group to which he belongs. 
Most of them he may enter or leave with- 
out otherwise altering his nature and con- 
ditions. Others he enters without choice 
and cannot leave without taking leave of 
his life. The citizen of America may be- 
come one of England, the Baptist a Meth- 
odist, the lawyer a banker, the Elk a 
Mason, the Republican a Socialist, the cap- 
italist a proletarian. But the son, father, 
uncle, cousin cannot cease to be these; he 
cannot reject the relationships these words 



508 



THE DIAL 



[November 22 



express, nor alter them. If they obtain 
once, they obtain forever. So an Irish- 
man is always an Irishman, a Jew always 
a Jew. Irishman or Jew is born; citizen, 
lawyer, or church-member is made. Irish- 
man and Jew are facts in nature; citizen 
and church-member are artefacts in civil- 
ization. Natural groups, like the Irish, 
the Jews, or any nationality, cannot be 
destroyed without destroying their mem- 
bers. Artificial groups, like states, 
churches, professions, castes, can. These 
are social organizations; natural groups 
are social organisms, organisms conscious 
of their nature, their powers, their inter- 
ests and desires, conscious, in a word, of 
their social personality, and acting in such 
a way as to preserve, enhance, and per- 
fect it. 

Empirically, then, what is affirmed in 
1914 concerning nationality is the natural 
right which was declared in 1776 inalien- 
able to personality. The "principle of 
nationality" may be stated in paraphrase 
of the Declaration of Independence: All 
nationalities are created equal and are en- 
dowed by their creator with certain in- 
alienable rights, among them being life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. . . 
To secure these rights governments are 
instituted among nationalities, deriving 
their just powers from the consent of the 
governed. 

That is, the principle of nationality is 
an extension of the scope of democracy 
from single to group personalities. Its 
application to artificial persons of that 
order corporations and the like within 
the state, is traditional; the struggle for 
its application to the nationality is only 
just culminating. As the declaration sup- 
plied the governing concept for the con- 
stitution of the United States, so the 
"principle of nationality" supplies it for the 
constitution of mankind. International or- 
ganization, it implies, depends upon recip- 
rocal national responsibility, and indicates, 
hence, a nationhood suffrage parallel to 
manhood suffrage: one nation, one vote. 
Could this doctrine ever have been ade- 
quately applied, Europe would have had 
a happier history. Differences between 
nationalities and their corresponding states 
in numbers, size, wealth, quality, and 



power, however, weighted the influence of 
nations variously and unduly; encouraged 
in international affairs fear, jealousy, and 
suspicion to such a degree that the modi- 
cum of justice and fair dealing which the 
United States uniquely offered Nicaragua 
and Mexico was looked at askance; kept 
international behavior set upon a policy of 
laissez-faire, which only the growing eco- 
nomic interdependence of the world has 
succeeded in modifying. The internal 
affairs of states, no matter how rotten, are 
holy, taboo to all interference. An out- 
raged German government whines over 
the presumption in President Wilson's re- 
ply to the Pope's peace proposals and can- 
not interfere with Turkey's treatment of 
Armenia; the governments of our allies 
tread softly with regard to one another's 
sacred inwards. No interference in a 
state's internal affairs; no responsibility in 
foreign policy; no accountability, except to 
force, in anything. Each nation, each gov- 
ernment is sovereign; each nationality 
wants sovereignty; and sovereignty is 
irresponsibility, is international anarchy. 

Under the prevailing system the de- 
mands of the nationalities are just. With- 
out sovereignty, the policy of international 
laissez-faire, tempered by piratical im- 
perialism, leaves a nationality at the mercy 
of any exploiter who is stronger. With- 
out sovereignty it fears the security of its 
life, its liberty, its free way to happiness. 
Without sovereignty it is hampered in per- 
forming what Mazzini has called "its spe- 
cial function in the European work of 
civilization." But this sovereignty is also 
its enemy. It is the ground of interna- 
tional rivalry, the source of the afflatus 
called national honor, of militarism, 
and of dynastic domination. The "prin- 
ciple of nationality" solves nothing if 
it commits the post-bellum settlement to 
an increased number of sovereignties. It 
fails of its purpose if it fails to secure an 
open way for the spontaneous powers and 
happiness of nationalities. Without this 
security there can be no lasting peace; and 
sovereignty both is and is not this security. 

The problem of the reorganization of 
Europe can find its solution only in con- 
ditions that will unequivocally secure this 

end - H. M. KALLEN.

The Idea of a University 

Every American college and university 
is affected by the issue raised in Professor 
Beard's dramatic resignation from Colum- 
bia as a protest against trustee autocracy. 
For the conditions which he found intol- 
erable spring from a ruling conception held 
by university trustees and a portion of con- 
servative public opinion as to the nature of 
the modern university. The methods 
taken at Columbia to secure the expulsion 
of Professors Cattell and Dana are very 
revealing as to the status of professors 
and the nature of university prestige. The 
excuses, causes, and reasons given by the 
university authorities and the current com- 
ment of the newspapers show how frankly 
the American university has become a 
financial corporation, strictly analogous, in 
its motives and responses, to the corpora- 
tion which is concerned in the production 
of industrial commodities. Trustees who 
are business men, who hold positions as 
directors or executives in large financial or 
industrial corporations, carry over into the 
management of the university the attitudes 
and sensitivities learned in the corporate 
world. The university produces learning 
instead of steel or rubber, but the nature 
of the academic commodity has become 
less and less potent in ensuring for the 
academic workman a status materially dif- 
ferent from that of any other kind of 
employee. 

As directors in this corporation of learn- 
ing, trustees seem to regard themselves pri- 
marily as guardians of invested capital. 
They manage as a sacred trust the various 
bequests, gifts, endowments which have 
been made to the university by men and 
women of the same orthodoxies as them- 
selves. Their obligation is to see that the 
quality of the commodity which the uni- 
versity produces is such as to seem repu- 
table to the class which they represent. 
And in order to maintain the flow of capi- 
tal and the general credit of the institution 
they must keep the stock above par. In 
the minds apparently of the trustees, and 
of the executives and professors who work 
with them, the reputation of a university 



is comparable to the standing of a corpora- 
tion's securities on the street, the news- 
papers taking the place of the stock 
exchange. The real offence of Professors 
Cattell and Dana seems to have been not 
so much that they were unpatriotic as that 
they had lowered the prestige of the uni- 
versity in the public mind. Neither the 
president nor the trustees nor the faculty 
committees brought forward any evidence 
besides epithet that either professor had, 
in the language of President Butler's warn- 
ing, actually "opposed or counselled oppo- 
sition to the laws of the United States, or 
had acted, spoken, or written treason." 
What these professors had done was to 
associate themselves with organizations 
which were enjoying infamy in the irres- 
ponsible press. No attempt was made to 
discover whether the newspaper accounts 
were true. Chatter and rumor were suf- 
ficient to convict them. Why? Because 
on the stock exchange it is by rumor and 
prejudice that the value of securities is 
hit, not by evidence. When your stock is 
depressed by an alarming rumor, it is irre- 
levant whether the rumor is true or not. 
The mischief lies in what people think, 
not in the actual facts. And for this pur- 
pose newspaper chatter is authoritative. 
Your object then becomes not to discover 
the truth but to combat the rumor. If the 
fall in your stock is due to a suspicion of 
the value of your commodity, you renew 
your efforts to convince the public of its 
soundness. If it is due to an offending 
employee, you dismiss the employee. Hav- 
ing removed the cause of the prejudice, you 
may then expect your securities to resume 
their former level. 

Only on such an interpretation can we 
explain the tendency of university authori- 
ties to rely on newspaper opinion and upon 
the complaints of persons whom they 
would not take seriously on any other 
question whatever. One is often amazed 
at the callousness of university trustees 
towards the indignation that follows these 
arbitrary dismissals of professors. But 
this corporate attitude naturally discounts 
the opinions of the non-investing public. It 
is not the discontent of idealists that 



510 



THE DIAL 



[November 22 



matters, but the vague complaints from 
parents that their sons are being taught 
irreligion and sedition within the univer- 
sity, complaints from business men that a 
professor is tainted with economic heresy, 
indignation of prominent alumni at the 
connection of the university's name with 
unpopular movements. These are the 
attitudes that depress the credit of the 
university in the investing world, and these 
are the attitudes that carry weight, there- 
fore, with the university president and the 
trustees. Vested interests presumably re- 
ceive dividends in the form of orthodox 
graduates. Whatever interferes with the 
supply of such a revenue is therefore a 
serious assault on the stability of the cor- 
poration. 

In any such system of ideas, the profes- 
sor becomes inevitably a mere employee of 
a company which has a standing to 
maintain in the corporate world. His 
intellectual freedom is extremely preca- 
rious, because a chance remark, or any 
public activity, may bring him that news- 
paper censure which causes the grave 
damage the university is likely to incur in 
the minds of the significant classes. An 
"institution of learning," administered 
even on autocratic principles, might be 
expected to move always with the most 
scrupulous regard for the dignity of the 
teacher and for the principles of legal evi- 
dence in any cases of dismissal or censure. 
The professor might be expected to have 
a status more secure and more respected 
than that of the employee, holding his 
position from day to day, and might be 
expected to be dismissed only after formal 
charges, and after conviction on evidence 
which would satisfy an impersonal and 
judicial mind. None of the circumstances 
connected with the latest expulsions at Co- 
lumbia shows that any such standards 
prevail in our largest and wealthiest uni- 
versity. They show, on the contrary, that 
under trustee control the American uni- 
versity has been degraded from its old, 
noble ideal of a community of scholarship 
to a private commercial corporation. And 
the situation at Columbia is merely a 
sharpened form of what has gone on in 



other colleges and universities throughout 
the country. 

Professor Beard's stirring gesture has 
raised the issue whether this reigning cor- 
porate idea of a university shall any longer 
prevail. If that reigning idea is making it 
impossible for a man of Charles Beard's 
intellectual distinction, courage, and demo- 
cratic idealism to serve our largest univer- 
sity, we have come to the time when 
Americans will have to choose between the 
current philosophy of university govern- 
ment and the presence in the university of 
independent and vigorous minds. If a 
man like Professor Beard is to be forced 
to cut short his academic career because 
the status of the college teacher is becom- 
ing intolerable, a revolution in the idea of 
a university cannot come too quickly. The 
present agitation for at least a constitu- 
tional form of government by which con- 
trol over all academic matters is turned 
over to the faculties is an advance. But to 
ensure the instructor's freedom, both uni- 
versity authorities and the newspaper pub- 
lic must learn to distinguish between his 
academic functions and his private opin- 
ions and activities. He will scarcely be 
free as long as he is vulnerable for 
activities which in no way concern his 
academic work, or as long as he is 
considered to implicate the university in 
everything he says or does. The partisan 
of "academic freedom" will also want to 
see worked out an entirely new status for 
both the instructor, who is now an em- 
ployee, and for the student, who is now 
partly ward and partly consumer. State 
control is no solution, so long as director- 
ship is given to men with the current 
corporate attitudes. State ownership of 
universities, with control vested in the 
"guild" of professors, is probably the ideal 
solution. Meanwhile what is most needed 
is a clear realization of the hostility be- 
tween the present system of ideas which 
governs university control, and the func- 
tional and cooperative ideals which should 
govern a community devoted to learning. 
That hostility is almost complete, and Pro- 
fessor Beard has done a great service by 
making a dramatic issue of it at the present

Literary Affairs in London 

(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 
Two books have just been published, each deal- 
ing in its own way with the past of England. 
To-day we are thinking intensely and almost 
hectically of the present, a little but not enough 
of the future, and hardly at all of the past. 
Yet knowledge of, and meditation on, the past 
is an essential thing if our concern with the 
present is to be healthy or useful. We look 
back at most for parallels to our position, but 
we do not trouble about the long sequence of 
cause and effect that has been bringing us for 
thousands of years exactly to the point where 
we now stand. We think in months and days, 
not in epochs; our strained attention is concen- 
trated on to-day and on the next three or six 
or twelve months, according to the view taken 
by the military expert, who has developed in 
every one of us, of the probable duration of the 
rest of the war. 

It is not a bad thing, then, that two authors 
in whom the thoughtful public has confidence 
should have plunged into past centuries. Mr. 
G. K. Chesterton, who calls his book with proud 
simplicity, "A Short History of England," races 
through the ages at an exhilarating speed. Mr. 
Stephen Graham, who pitches the action of his 
novel, "Priest of the Ideal," in the present day, 
gets back to the early English church by taking 
his protagonists on a tour round the sacred 
places of the faith; and in each place, lona, 
Lindisfarne, Durham, or York, it seems as though 
he stepped off some sort of moving staircase of 
modernity into a cool and motionless dimension 
quite outside the hurry of time. The contrast 
between these two writers in their treatment of 
the past is immense. Mr. Chesterton conceives 
the ages as galloping by, while to Mr. Graham 
they have an enormous, vegetable motion that is 
almost imperceptible. Yet the two have a very 
similar effect; and they arouse, the one by quiet 
intensity, the other by restless vigor, as it were 
a revival of sensation in those obscure and hid- 
den nerves which connect us with our past. 

Mr. Chesterton's career through English his- 
tory is not only rapid, but a little surprising. 
He has, of course, a political theory to support; 
and it is not my business to say here whether I 
think his theory tenable or his historical founda- 
tion of it correct. He believes that England 
is ruled by the rich, that the bulk of the pop- 
ulation is without an effective word in the gov- 



ernment of the country, and that the rich are 
every day increasing their power and applying 
it to what he and his friend, Mr. Belloc, call 
"the regimentation of the poor." He now traces 
the ascendancy of the wealthy classes to the end 
of the Middle Ages when the barons overcame 
the monarchy and, gradually resolving themselves 
into a new nobility, part legal, part commercial, 
part land-owning, but predominantly plutocratic, 
used Henry VIII as a catspaw for the spoliation 
of the monasteries and so absorbed the major 
part of the wealth of the country. He sees an- 
other "revolt of the rich" in the Puritan Revo- 
lution and the execution of Charles I; and the 
enthronement of George I is to him a proof that 
the rich had become so powerful that they were 
able to put a mere dummy into the seat of 
Edward I. Whatever you may think of these 
opinions, it is certainly true that Mr. Chester- 
ton's statements of fact are almost always im- 
peccable; it is only in his interpretation of the 
facts that he departs from orthodoxy. It is 
beyond doubt that Hampden, the Ship Money 
hero, was, as he says, a very wealthy squire; 
and you may make what you like of his epi- 
gram that "there was no village Hampden in 
Hampden village." It is also true that Crom- 
well was a member of an immensely wealthy 
family; and, though Mr. Chesterton does not 
mention it, it is one of the odd dark corners 
of English history that his real name, the name 
he used when his signature was required in con- 
nection with money, was not Cromwell but Wil- 
liams. But whether these things cast any doubt 
on the complete disinterestedness of the great 
Puritans is a question that each man can decide 
for himself without browbeating from authority 
as Mr. Chesterton has decided. 

But perhaps this reversal of common opinion 
is not the most important part of Mr. Chester- 
ton's book. What does matter in it is his intense 
and passionate love of the English people. He 
sees our faults and our blindnesses, but he sees 
also, in just relation to them, our virtues and 
our misfortunes. It may seem rather a ridicu- 
lous attitude to exhibit tenderness toward a great 
nation; yet this is what Mr. Chesterton does 
without becoming ridiculous. He has never be- 
longed to that odious historical school which 
trumpets the greatness of England as though 
she were the one righteous person in a world of 
beings at once ruffianly and inefficient. These 
writers are the bagmen of the realm of ideas; 
and the higher their level of expression the more 



512

[November 22 



disgusting their attitude seems. Mr. Chester- 
ton in times of peace was a little too much in- 
clined to harry us for our vices. But, early on 
in the war, he wrote a poem in which he said: 

Of old with a divided heart 

I taw my people's pride expand 
Since a man's soul is torn apart 

By mother earth and fatherland. 

and told how he knew 

A blacker thing than blood's own dye 

Weighed down great Hawkins on the sea; 

And Nelson turned his blindest eye 
On Naples and on liberty. 

But he went on to say that he now gave thanks 
to the "thousandfold and frozen folk": 

Who have no faith a man could mourn, 

Nor freedom any man desires; 
But in a new clean light of scorn 

Close up my quarrel with my sires. 

Mr. Chesterton is one of not many writers who 
have risen to the occasion of the war, and his 
history of England is, in a sense, a second and 
richer expression of that closing up of a quarrel. 
It is a poem of which the English people are the 
hero; and when I say the English people, I do 
not mean only the people who live in England. 
To illustrate this point and Mr. Chesterton's 
style at the same time, I may quote a few sen- 
tences on the American Declaration of Inde- 
pendence : 

We talk, with a humiliation too rare with us, 
about our dubious part in the secession of America. 
Whether it increase or decrease the humiliation 
I do not know; but I strongly suspect that we had 
very little to do with it. I believe we counted for 
uncommonly little in the case. They were led on 
by a light that went before. 

That is a compliment to the American people; 
and compliments between us, I believe, are now 
not wasted. They are the right and proper ex- 
pression of a right and proper spirit. But I do 
not think that Mr. Chesterton is here at all 
concerned with compliments. He is merely re- 
joicing in a manifestation in English blood of a 
temper that he admires. 

Mr. Graham equally pierces through a surface 
of things he disapproves to a heart which he 
maintains to be fundamentally sound. His two 
chief characters are Hampden, an English lay 
preacher who is stirred to spiritual blossoming 
by the stress of the war, and Washington King, 
a rather farcical American who comes to Eng- 
land for the purpose of buying relics, from a 
derelict gargoyle to the tower on Glastonbury 
Tor, by means of which he intends to endow his 
own country with the past she lacks. Hampden 
agrees he is justified in purchasing whatever 



England will sell, because the sale will mean 
that the object sold has outlived its significance ; 
and he conducts King on a tour around the holy 
places where Christianity first rooted, in the 
hope of learning that England still treasures her 
sacred things. The scheme of the book is de- 
cidedly odd. It is now written in a tone of 
profound and brooding meditation, as in the 
passages descriptive of lona and Lindisfarne, now 
in a tone of satire as when King invokes the aid 
of a newspaper magnate, who first booms him. 
then turns and rends him. It is interspersed 
with Hampden's sermons, very beautiful passages 
of religious feeling, and ends with his death at 
the front. The most impressive note is sounded 
in those pages in which Hampden, as it seems, 
by mere intensity of will gets into touch in the 
sacred places with those who made them sacred 
and forces on the reader a realization of the 
fact that the past lives, that we cannot move a 
step or live a minute as though those first mis- 
sionaries had never been. But the book is odd 
and partly incomprehensible. The mystical and 
the ordinary blend in it queerly. It is like look- 
ing at a stick thrust half-way into water half 
of it is plain and then quite suddenly half of 
it is refracted and unreal. And sometimes it 
is irritating because the whole book is not writ- 
ten in the same key. King, for example, is at one 
moment as absurd as a character in "Candide," 
at another as delicately real as a person observed 
by Turgenev. It provokes on the whole the re- 
flection that Mr. Graham's book on Russia may 
have been misjudged, that he was not reflecting 
with extreme subtlety the obscure soul of an 
alien people, but reflecting, as easily in that mir- 
ror as in any other, the peculiarities of his own 
mind. 

I have no space to do more than note the 
fact that a posthumous book by Edward Thomas, 
who was killed in the attack on Vimy Ridge, 
has just appeared and that his "Tenth Muse" 
has been issued with a short memoir by Mr. 
John Freeman. Thomas was a good writer who 
somehow never came into his inheritance. He 
was a fine critic and he had that eye for country 
which our modern writers are beginning spe- 
cially to develop. But he mixed up criticism 
with the country, so that nobody ever knew 
what to make of him, and he spent nine-tenths 
of his life in writing potboilers the kind of pot- 
boiler that does not sell profusely. He is re- 
ported to have said once that he had reviewed 
every book of verse which had appeared during 



1917] 



THE DIAL

the last twenty years. The remark might be 
his epitaph. Criticism in this country is a thank- 
less, unhonored, hard-driven, and ill-paid busi- 
ness; and it was certainly a stony stepmother to 
Thomas's rare and rather delicate talent. He 
felt this; and the feeling is probably responsible 
for a certain reluctance and coldness even in 
his most companionable books. I hope to return 
to him when the extraordinarily beautiful poems, 
which he began shyly to produce in the last years 
of his life, are collected and published.

Murmurous, at evening, over the yellow-hilled 

Lone land they came, 

Crowding about his heels like timid sheep, 

Whispering his name, 

Peering at one another, pondering what they 

heard 

Resolute, each, to keep 
His every utterance as the chosen word. 
Till, like a group of vagrant ghosts they filled 
The broad slope where he paused, full in the 

flame 

Of the scarlet sunset, stood and never stirred, 
Brooding his feverish eyes 
Full of deep wonder, restless with surprise.

Then suddenly, from somewhere in the crowd, 

They heard him cry aloud : 

"For shame, for shame, fruitless and faithless 

tree, 

That canst not, even to me, 
The Son of God, hungry, with weary feet, 
Give anything to eat; 

For that I came and that thou didst not see, 
Henceforth forever fruitless be." 
And saw him, speaking, point as at some vile 
Unholy thing then turn away and smile. 

Ill 

Light-lipped is laughter: in a far-off age, 

One, turning his dim page, 

Hungry in body and spirit for a text, 

Paused, half perplexed, 

Then rose and took upon him to confute 

For this world and the next 

All them whose faith had given God no fruit.

It would be doing no very frightful violence 
to the truth to say that one could divide most con- 
temporary American verse into two great types 
the types indicated by the title of this review. 
If one leaves out of account the matter of poetic 
form, rudely ignoring for the moment the bitter 
quarrel between vers-librists and metrists, one 
could justifiably conclude that all our contempo- 
rary poets are purveyors either of confectionery 
or caviar. Two or three exceptions we must 
make, of course: Amy Lowell, clearly, serves a 
melange of both; and Messrs. Frost, Robinson, 
and Fletcher, and perhaps Mr. Masters, will 
escape our classification altogether which is to 
their credit. But in the main, it can be plausibly 
argued that the classification holds. 

The confectioners, of course, are in the major- 
ity. These are the prettifiers, the brighteners 
of life, the lilting ones. They fill our standard 
magazines; they are annually herded by Mr. 
Braithwaite into his anthology; and now, taking 
advantage of the poetic decuman wave and the 
delusions of publishers, they are swamping the 
land with their sweet wares. The conservative 
press flings garlands at them, the "Literary 
Digest" quotes them, the Poetry Society of 
America (alas!) fetes them. Hourly they grow 
more numerous, more powerful. The coura- 
geous and creative ones, and those who look to 
poetry for truthfulness and for a consciousness 
of life always subtler and more individually 
worked will soon have to fight for their lives. 
And how, indeed, shall they be able to fight? 
There are no giants to be slain rather, a host 
of pigmies, and all alike. A poem by one might 
bear the signature of any. They sing in chorus 
rather than singly. 

The present group of volumes if we except 
"Al Que Quiere," by Mr. Williams, which we 
reserve for our course in caviar is an excellent 
illustration of this. How many critics, not per- 
sonally acquainted with these four authors, would 
know the difference if the names had been 
shuffled? Mr. Powys, perhaps, would protrude 



514 



THE DIAL 



[November 22 



one would be a trifle alarmed at so much 
howling Weltschmerz, so many Sphinxes and 
wicked heathen kisses, so much passionate frustra- 
tion, in Mr. Kilmer, for example ; and one might, 
the case being reversed, start at Mr. Powys's so 
speedy conversion to ululating Catholicism. But 
even here the difference is in the symbols rather 
than in the literary quality. They are both, they 
are all, blood brothers sentimentalists, dabblers 
in the pretty and sweet, rhetoricians of the "thou 
and thee" school, pale-mouthed clingers to the 
artificial and archaic. Here are platitudes neatly 
dressed, invocatory sonnets, the use of italics for 
emphasis (that last infirmity!), and all the stale 
literary tricks so relished, especially by the female, 
the "calls o' love," the "cries i' the wind," 
homing birds, in fact, the whole stock-in-trade 
of the magazine poet. Of Mr. Reed these remarks 
are partially unjust. Mr. Reed is too well bred 
to go so far. He restrains his platitudes from 
any attempt at lilting; his gait, indeed, is pedes- 
trian. But of Mr. Kilmer and Mr. Powys and 
Mrs. Garrison particularly Mrs. Garrison 
they are all too true. Here is nothing new, noth- 
ing distinctive, the trotting out of the same old 
passions, the same old heartbreaks and love songs, 
ghostly distillations of fragrances all too familiar. 
Is it possible for individuals to be so little indi- 
vidual? Have they never experienced anything 
for themselves? The publisher tells us that Mr. 
Kilmer has had, for a man still young, an aston- 
ishingly varied career. Nevertheless, one could 
not guess it from Mr. Kilmer's book. Ideas, 
emotions, language, rhythms, all are oddly sec- 
ond-hand, as if they had been offered to him and 
blandly accepted. So too with Mrs. Garrison, 
with the addition of a touch more femininely 
sensuous, a sentimentalism a trifle more unctuous. 
So too with Mr. Powys, though his range is 
wider, his intellect, in a stereotyped way, freer. 

The trouble with these poets, at bottom, is 
simply that they are imitative, and imitative 
with a sentimental bias. A few years ago an 
objective psychologist, a behaviorist, M. Nicolas 
Kostyleff, made a tentative study of the mechan- 
ism of poetic inspiration. The conclusions he 
reached, whatever else their value, were highly 
suggestive. An important part in poetic creation, 
he maintains, is an automatic verbal discharge, 
along chains of association, set in motion by a 
chance occurrence. The difference between a 
poet who merely echoes the ideas and rhythms 
of the past, and the poet who creates something 
new, is simply that in the former instance this 



verbo-motor mechanism is not deeply related to the 
poet's specific sensibility ; in the latter, it is. This 
distinction fits the present case admirably. These 
poets, in other words, have not experienced 
sharply for themselves. They have drawn their 
stores of verbo-motor reactions from the books 
of others, without checking up from personal 
observation. They color their lives to a certain 
extent in accordance with their too early adoption 
of a speech which is not their own, instead of 
coloring their speech in the light of their own 
experience. They give us, therefore, neither 
clearness nor truth, nor any beauty of a personal 
kind. They give us instead a tame uniformity, 
floods of tepid rhetoric, vague regurgitations of 
the words of others, varied now and then for 
good measure with the grotesquely inept and the 
foolishly naive. And over and under it all runs 
our undying American adoration of the pretty- 
pretty, the pious, the sacred virtues. Life is made 
out to be simply one sweet thing after another. 
These are, in fact, confectioners, and not inspired 
ones, either. 

With the question whether there might not 
arise a great confectioner one who would bring 
genius and originality to his task of enlighten- 
ment and cheer or, if not that, at any rate 
another Longfellow we need not concern our- 
selves as yet, merely replying that there will be 
time for discussion when he arises. Meanwhile 
it is more interesting to turn to a consideration 
of the type of poetry we have called caviar, and 
to Mr. Williams, who brings us samples. If 
the purveyors of confectionery are almost totally 
lacking in individuality, the purveyors of caviar 
fly to the other extreme: they carry individuality 
to excess. These are our modern individualists. 
What do they care how peculiar or esoteric their 
idiom is? Self-expression is the thing. If the 
crowd cannot understand them, or ignores them, 
so much the worse for the crowd. This is a senti- 
mental attitude, there is a good deal of pose in it, 
and a consequent defeat is easily regarded by the 
poet as the martyrdom of the truly great. Never- 
theless, it is oddly significant that these caviarists, 
these purveyors of bitter realism, collectors of the 
bizarrely unpleasant and the irrelevantly true, 
have a style entirely their own. M. Kostyleff 
would admit that their mechanisms of verbo- 
motor reaction are closely related to their spe- 
cific sensibilities: they are as clearly original as 
our other poets are imitative. It seems to be 
true, in this connection, that the realists have a 
much less stereotyped style than the lilters. They 



1917] 



THE DIAL

appear to remember that, after all, literature 
should be drawn from life, not from literature. 
They experience first (and whole-heartedly, not 
with a fountain-pen behind the ear) and write 
afterward. 

Mr. Williams is a case in point. His book 
throughout has the savory quality of originality. 
Is it poetry? That is the question. Self -por- 
traiture it is vivid, acridly sensuous, gnarled, 
by turns delicate and coarse. There is humor in 
it, too, which is rare enough in contemporary 
verse. But on the whole it is more amiable 
than beautiful, more entertaining than success- 
ful. The reasons for this are several. To begin 
with, Mr. Williams too seldom goes below the 
surface. He restricts his observations almost 
entirely to the sensory plane. His moods, so to 
speak, are nearly always the moods of the eye, 
the ear, and the nostril. We get the impression 
from these poems that his world is a world of 
plane surfaces, bizarrely colored, and cunningly 
arranged so as to give an effect of depth and 
solidity; but we do not get depth itself. When 
occasionally this is not true, when Mr. Williams 
takes the plunge into the profounder stream of 
consciousness, he appears always to pick out the 
shallows, and to plunge gingerly. The sensory 
element is kept in the foreground, the tone 
remains whimsically colloquial, and as a result 
the total effect even when the material is inher- 
ently emotional is still quaintly cerebral. Is it at 
bottom a sort of puritanism that keeps Mr. Wil- 
liams from letting go? There is abundant evi- 
dence here that his personality is a rich one; but 
his inhibitions keep him forever dodging his own 
spotlight. He is ashamed to be caught crying, 
or exulting, or adoring. On the technical side 
this puritanism manifests itself in a resolute sup- 
pression of beauty. Beauty of sound he denies 
himself, beauty of prosodic arrangement too; the 
cadences are prose cadences, the line-lengths are 
more or less arbitrary, and only seldom, in a 
short-winded manner, are they effective. In 
brief, Mr. Williams is a realistic imagist: he has 
the air of floating through experience as a sen- 
sorium and nothing more. He denies us his 
emotional reactions to the things he sees, even 
to the extent of excluding intensity of personal 
tone from his etchings; and his readers, there- 
fore, have no emotional reactions, either. They 
see, but do not feel. Is Mr. Williams never any- 
thing but amused or brightly interested? The 
attitude has its limits, no matter how fertile its 
basis of observation. 



Of course, one prefers, in the last analysis, 
Mr. Williams and his caviar to any amount of 
thin saccharine. It is at least real. But one 
concludes that the richer and more vital realm 
lies midway between the extremes: in the truth- 
tellings of those who not only see sharply and 
know themselves intimately, but also feel pro- 
foundly, relate themselves to their world, and 
tell us what they know in the comprehensive bal- 
anced harmony which we call art.

Making Germany Democratic 

THE COMING DEMOCRACY. By Hermann Fernau. 
(E. P. Button & Co.; $2.) 

Bishop Berkeley proposed to cure all physical 
ailments with the general application of tar 
water. He was unique in the selection of a rem- 
edy but not in his dependence upon one cure for 
various ills. The history of human thought con- 
sists largely in the appearance of great thinkers 
who interpret the universe in terms of one sub- 
stance and who would mitigate the maladapta- 
tions of man and his environment with a single 
prescription. To-day the evil is German autoc- 
racy and the one remedy the overthrow of the 
Hohenzollerns. "The Coming Democracy," by 
Hermann Fernau, presents a diagnosis and pro- 
pounds the antidote. 

From an enforced retreat at Berne, Switzer- 
land, Fernau charges German autocracy with re- 
sponsibility for the Great War and calls upon his 
countrymen to repudiate their leaders. No 
American has more severely indicted the Hohen- 
zollerns. He believes the historical development 
and the present constitution of the German 
Empire make for war, not peace. The govern- 
ment is the kaiser, possessed of God-given mo- 
narchial rights, received and to be interpreted by 
the kaiser alone. An examination of the Ger- 
man constitution shows that the states of the 
empire are but appendages of Prussia, for this 
state dominates the Bundesrat, or Federal Coun- 
cil. The states have surrendered to the emperor, 
king of Prussia, exclusive power to declare war, 
conclude peace, make alliances and treaties, and 
to appoint and accredit envoys. The imperial dip- 
lomatic, civil, and administrative officials are 
responsible personally to the emperor and to him 
alone. He may, when he considers it necessary, 
declare any portion of the federal territory in a 



516 



THE DIAL 



[November 22 



state of war and thus extinguish "civil authori- 
ties, the liberty of the press, speech, meetings, 
union and even travel." The Reichstag is a 
fictitious democratic trimming. Its representa- 
tives, selected according to an electoral law of 
1871, do not represent the German nation of 
to-day. "If, at any time, the government loses 
its majority in the Reichstag, it dissolves the lat- 
ter (the Emperor only requires for this purpose 
the assent of the Bundesrat, of which he is assured 
beforehand), or simply ignores it." Its financial 
control is easily evaded and its law-making func- 
tions are confined to initiating laws and petitions 
for the consideration of the Bundesrat. The 
chancellor represents the emperor and is in no 
way responsible to the Reichstag, while "only the 
nobility, endowed with divine insight, is entitled 
in Prusso-Germany to fill the most important 
offices and to solve the most difficult political 
problems. Consequently all leading govern- 
mental, administrative, and military posts are 
filled by members of the nobility." 

The continuance of this structure rests with 
the army. The German army represents a fusion 
of feudal absolute military control with the mod- 
ern system of universal military service. The 
army is national, but its allegiance is personal. 
"You have sworn me the oath of allegiance," 
said William II to the newly sworn recruits of 
1891. "More than ever before unbelief and dis- 
satisfaction lift their heads in the Fatherland, 
and the occasion may arise when you will have 
to shoot down or bayonet your own brothers and 
relations. Then seal your allegiance with the 
sacrifice of your heart's blood." 

Equally potent for dynastic security has been 
the propaganda of ideas. A comparison of intel- 
lectual Germany of to-day with the Germany of 
fifty years ago reveals no similarity. The ideals 
of Kant, Fichte, Feuerbach, Schleiermacher, and 
Schiller are aliens in the intellectual community 
of to-day. "Learning without character, knowl- 
edge without conscience, organization without 
humanity, discipline without liberty, ideal with- 
out dignity; such is the result of a mental devel- 
opment that, commencing with the disappearance 
of the Weimar Germanism, and politically 
trained by Metternich, Bismarck, and William 
II, and intellectually by Hegel, Treitschke, and 
their disciples, could only play its part as a pro- 
tecting power of the dynasty." This is the out- 
come on the one hand of a suppression of opinion 
hostile to the dynasty and on the other of a gov- 
ernmental encouragement and subsidy of think- 



ers who have persistently taught that the state is 
a divine entity in which the individual is insig- 
nificant; that the essence of a state is power 
unlimited by moral responsibility; that the ends 
of a state are best attained through war; that 
war is "divine, holy, normal and the moral law 
governing the development of the human race"; 
that racial science indicates that the Teuton is 
the highest type of man, and, consequently, the 
divinely appointed vehicle of European civiliza- 
tion. 

Governed by a dynasty thus entrenched, which 
recognizes no law but that of might, Germany 
can be nothing other than a menace to interna- 
tional peace. It was not surprising to see Ger- 
man representatives at the Hague in 1899 and 
again in 1907 oppose arbitration of disputes 
between nations. And when other countries sug- 
gested arbitration tribunals, reduction of arma- 
ments, and so on, as means of insuring peace, 
it was to be expected that the Kaiser would reject 
a limitation upon his free action with this enun- 
ciation of a strong-arm policy: "Believe me, 
peace will never be better safeguarded than by a 
perfectly organized and prepared German army." 

Fernau seeks to prove from German official 
documents and admissions of Prussian statesmen 
that the Hohenzollerns deliberately struck at the 
peace of Europe in 1914 and by means of false- 
hood and misrepresentation enlisted the loyal sup- 
port of the German people in a "defensive" war. 

Thus proceeds the arraignment. Perhaps this 
is no time to pass upon its accuracy. It will be 
accepted by many who in a calmer period would 
insist that it is an oversimplified exposition of 
complicated and interrelated tendencies. The 
outcome may well be an unscrupulous autocracy 
hostile to the peace of the world, but it does not 
follow, as Fernau implies, that contributing 
agents were motivated by sycophantic intentions. 
I am willing to let the indictment stand, how- 
ever, if emphasis will shift to the proposed reme- 
dies. Fernau's are simple, too simple. He would 
make Germany a republic and institute some 
form of international organization which will 
"frustrate by force of arms any attempt to restore 
personal despotism." He sincerely believes, in 
common with many Americans, that wars will 
cease with the disappearance of dynasties. If his 
book will enforce this illusion, its present value 
is questionable. It is not sufficient to paint Ger- 
man autocracy with lurid colors. If we are truly 
anxious to preserve democracy, we must ask the 
question, Why have the German people sub- 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



517 



mitted to the Hohenzollerns ? Why have they 
manifested no more discontent under a dynastic 
absolutism than have many Americans with a 
representative system? The explanation is not 
found exclusively in the standing army and a rule 
of fear, but in the careful attention given to the 
economic and social welfare of the German citi- 
zen. The happiness of a civilized people is most 
intimately related to its industrial organization, 
and although we may condemn the German feu- 
dal political structure, we should not hesitate to 
imitate its concern for the well-being of the indi- 
vidual. Unless democracies supply an equality 
of economic as well as political opportunity, they 
are democracies in name alone, and the funda- 
mental duty of Americans while waging this war 
is not to rage blindly at the Kaiser but to actual- 
ize the principles in which we profess belief. 

Once we attempt this, we shall see the futility 
of a universal nostrum for the world disease. 
What does it mean to say a nation is an inter- 
national menace? Ultimately, does it not imply 
that the individuals which constitute nations are 
imperiled in their development? This suggests 
that the time has come when we should cease 
thinking exclusively either in nationalistic or 
international terms; rather we should use the 
distributive welfare of mankind as a standard 
with which to test the effectiveness of both 
national and international organizations. The 
Coming Democracy will be, then, such an organi- 
zation both within and between states as will 
give to the individual a freedom for the develop- 
ment of his powers, and will substitute the 
principle of cooperation for that of force and coer- 
cion. If this be true, the overthrow of the 
Hohenzollerns is not a complete assurance of the 
future. It is Fernau's naive assumption that 
wars are caused solely by dynastic ambition which 
makes his book inadequate in the present exig- 
ency. Should the conclusion of the war substi- 
tute a rivalry of capitalistic interests for dynastic 
ambitions, we shall have made the familiar leap 
from the frying pan into the fire. Wars will 
persist until there is removed the present tempta- 
tion for political domination and trade expansion 
to go hand in hand. A monopoly of international 
opportunities is no different in principle from 
special business privileges within states. Regu- 
lated behavior and equality of opportunity must 
supersede international cut-throat competition 
before nations "shall beat their swords into 
ploughshares, and their spears into pruning- 

hooks '" V. T. THAYER.

THE SUBSTANCE OF GOTHIC. By Ralph Adams 
Cram. (Marshall Jones Company; $1.50.) 
These six lectures, given during the winter of 
1916-7 in the Lowell Institute course, in Boston, 
present Mr. Cram at his boldest and best. Astride 
his favorite charger, Mediasvalism, incased in the 
shining armor of his enthusiasms and his abhor- 
rences, wielding the Excalibur of his wisdom and 
his wit, he pursues the dragon of Modernism over 
Europe and adown the centuries by way of the 
abbeys, churches, and cathedrals he knows and 
loves so well. 

A great many people, because they do not 
agree with him, refuse to take Mr. Cram 
seriously ; but he is a potent force, a very palpable 
fact. The war is an eloquent commentary on 
his main contention, that materialism is devolu- 
tion; that its high gods are tottering to their 
fall; that we stand on the threshold of an age 
of faith, which will express itself in beauty. One 
naturally distrusts the special pleader, particularly 
if he be eloquent, as is Mr. Cram; but in his 
exaltation of the culture of the Middle Ages, 
cooler heads than his concur that the weight of 
evidence is all on his side. According to his view, 
Gothic architecture is the all-sufficient answer 
to all our claims to a superiority of culture. 
"Efficiency" is only a sign of civilization, a thing 
with which culture has nothing whatever to do. 
Although in this book Mr. Cram uses Gothic 
architecture so largely as a stick to beat a dog with, 
he has nevertheless produced the best and most 
interesting short, non-technical history of the 
style that it has been the reviewer's pleasure to 
encounter. And he has been able to do this so 
easily and so well, first, because he speaks of what 
he knows and loves, and second, because he has 
not been guilty of the error of isolating his his- 
tory of the building impulse from that of the 
life impulse, but has kept constantly before him 
the fact that the one is only the manifestation 
of the other. 

Mr. Cram writes not alone from the point of 
view of an ardent Gothicist, but from that of an 
ardent churchman as well, and this contributes 
both to the strength and to the weakness of his 
book to its strength because he has so keen and 
constant a realization of the nobility and vitality 
of the essential spirit of Catholicism ; to its weak- 
ness because all those who fail or have failed of 
that realization are to him either heretics, 
heathen, or pagans, bent on establishing the king- 
dom of Satan upon earth. Paradoxically, iron-

ically, intolerance was and is the indelible stain 
upon the white robe of the Church. The hunt- 
ing down of heresies and the persecution of 
heretics has ever been a part of its activities. 
If it is maintained that this is necessary to the 
existence of any religion, one has only to look 
for refutation to Buddhism, with its wise and 
gentle tolerance for alien faiths. Ask the av- 
erage Catholic priest about Buddha and he will 
tell you that Buddha was a false god of the 
heathens; ask a Buddhist priest about Christ and 
he will place him among the great hierarchy of 
spiritual teachers of mankind. 

If Catholicism, as Mr. Cram hopes, and half 
believes, is to effect the spiritual regeneration of 
civilized society after the war, it must become 
catholic in fact as well as in name. To the 
reviewer it seems quite as probable that a war- 
weary world will turn for healing to the secret 
and sacred wisdom of the immemorial East, 
treasured for centuries in the brooding bosom of 
Asia. Then indeed we shall find that West is 
East, and East is West, after centuries of mutual 
misunderstanding. 

In either case the world will not be the loser, 
for if its soul awakes, stirred and summoned by 
whatever "righteous and eternal forces," the 
flower of great art will blossom again, to be 
the vehicle of these forces. Science, now organ- 
ized so largely in the service of death, will become 
the handmaiden of beauty, inaugurating another 
of those wondrous epochs of free-flowing life of 
which ruined Rheims has come to be the sad and 
eloquent symbol. The German cannon which 
aimed to obliterate that solid and serene rebuke 
to all their frightfulness have acted instead as so 
many pointed forefingers to make men see and 
remember the real and eternal issues raised by 
the war. This is Mr. Cram's valedictory on that 
phase of art of which Rheims is a supreme 
example : 

Gothic art had done its work ; it had given immortal 
form to Christian civilization, and it passed with the 
splendid thing it had so faithfully served. It can 
never come back, at least with the life and power 
which were its own. . . Whether its spirit comes 
back to express, in some new series of forms, the 
righteous and eternal forces that made the Mediaeval 
man and the Mediaeval State, depends on the answer 
the world gives to the great question propounded by 
the War. 

The interest of Mr. Cram's book lies, not in 
the picture he draws of the splendor of mediaeval- 
ism as expressed in its architecture, masterly as 
that picture is, but in its foreshadowing of a pic- 
ture still to be painted on the blank canvas of 
the future years. CLAUDE BRAGDON. 



Personalities of a Half-Century 

REMINISCENCES OF A LITERARY LIFE. By Charles 
MACFARLANE, 1799-1858, Author and Traveller. 
With an introduction by John F. Tattersall. 
(Charles Scribner's Sons; $3.50.) 

About two years ago Mr. Frank Woore, an 
antiquarian bookseller of St. Peter's Street, Der- 
by, bought "at a country sale, among a num- 
ber of old ledgers and account books . . . two 
quarto manuscript volumes containing the rem- 
iniscences of Charles MacFarlane." A small 
part of the manuscript was in MacFarlane's 
own writing; for the rest a number of amanu- 
enses had been employed. Mr. John F. Tatter- 
sail was given a sight of these volumes, and has 
now edited them for the public. His work as 
editor, he informs us, has consisted in the omis- 
sion of a few entries of minor interest or of a 
nature to give pain to living representatives of 
the persons referred to, in the arrangement of 
the material, and in the correction of errors made 
by the amanuenses without the author's having 
had an opportunity to revise. 

MacFarlane has been all but forgotten, even 
by the students of the literature of the period. 
Yet in his day he was a man of considerable 
prominence. He was born in 1799, spent the 
happiest years of his life (1816-1827) at Na- 
ples, visited Greece and Turkey, returned to Lon- 
don in 1829, associated personally with nearly 
all the conspicuous people of the time, married, 
begot children, fell on evil days, was admitted 
as a "Poor Brother" to the Charterhouse in 
1857, and died the following year. His literary 
works, of which a list, compiled by himself, is 
given in an appendix, were of a miscellaneous 
character, but for the most part comprise travel 
sketches, historical writings, and three "historical 
tales," one of which, Mr. Tattersall conjectures, 
may have given Kingsley the idea for "Here- 
ward the Wake." 

The present volume, published sixty years 
after the demise of the author, was not meant 
by MacFarlane to be put into print immedi- 
ately. He composed it partly to cheer his soli- 
tude, partly with the thought that it might some 
day be published, and partly that it might be 
prized as an heirloom by his eldest son, an officer 
in the British army. It was begun in 1855. 
The author's purpose may be given in his own 
words : 

It has been my fortune, both at home and abroad, 
to be thrown among very many remarkable persons, 
of some of whom the world still talks and writes, 
and will continue to talk and write. I will say my 



1917}

say of these, and give some of their sayings and 
doings. I have never Boswellized ; I have never 
thought it fair to go from a man's table straight 
to one's diary, and before his dinner be digested or 
the flavour of his claret passed away, to sit down and 
enregister all that he has been saying in the confi- 
dence or carelessness of conviviality. But though I 
took no "notes," I pondered over and treasured what 
I heard as also what I saw and as my memory 
has been very retentive, I think that I may report 
with tolerable accuracy. I cannot promise to myself 
that in these souvenirs I shall be always and in- 
variably eulogistic. . . De mortuis nil nisi bonum 
is a benevolent-looking maxim, but it will not do in 
practice; it would be the death of history, of bio- 
graphy, of anecdote. 

Of anecdote of pleasantly told gossip there 
is no dearth in the volume. A rapid reading of 
the 300 pages is not only a recreation in itself, 
but a reminder of the personal characteristics of 
the men of that time and of the tangled inter- 
relations of these men with one another. Our 
memories grow hazy on such points as the jeal- 
ousy of Rogers ("Old Sam") toward Sydney 
Smith, the wearisome and boastful loquacity of 
the other Sidney Smith (the savior of Acre), the 
rudeness of Rogers to Lamartine in calling Be- 
ranger "the greatest poet of modern France," the 
feud between Leigh Hunt and Tom Moore, the 
perennial borrowing by Mrs. Leigh Hunt of five 
pounds from Carlyle; but MacFarlane reac- 
quaints us, or newly acquaints us, with these mat- 
ters. Of his lighter gossip an example is this 
incident "after a very jovial dinner at Old John 
Murray's" King John's: 

Theodore Hook was called upon to sing one of his 
improvised songs. He was in "keff" and in vein; he 
sang three songs in succession, and really excelled 
himself. [The conceited Thomas] Campbell, con- 
siderably more than three-fourths "fou," went off into 
an ecstasy, and taking his wig off his head, he threw 
it across the table at Theodore, shouting, "There, you 
dog! Take my laurels! They are yours!" The laugh- 
ter was uproarious. . . Washington Irving laughed 
until his sides ached, and then with a sly, demure 
face told Campbell that he had never before fancied 
those poetical locks were not of his own growth. 

But light, frothy comment is not all. Mac- 
Farlane was a man of cultivated mind, was a 
fit associate of the varied personalities with whom 
he had contact. The chief value of his book lies 
in his reaction to those personalities. And along 
with his easy-going chatter about them goes an 
instinct for discerning the things which are char- 
acteristic, revealing. He perceives that the 
graceful turn which Sir Thomas Lawrence 
would give a letter to a tailor a turn as elegant 
as if he meant the letter for a duchess is a 
symbol of the painter's pride in doing everything 
thoroughly. In Shelley he sees personal pecu- 



liarities, yet asserts that the poet "never could 
have been taken for anything but a true thor- 
oughbred English gentleman," and adds: "He 
was all over feeling, and all his feelings were 
of the acutest sort. Had he not been drowned 
as he was, he never could have lasted ; the bright, 
sharp sword had already outworn the scabbard. 
. . His was never atheism, but a sort of inde- 
scribable pantheism. . . Perishing as he did, he 
was getting his philosophy and his religion all 
right." Keats, he declares, "could hardly see a 
London street row without the impulsive wish 
to be in the midst of it. . . He was one of the 
most cheery and plucky little fellows I ever 
knew. . . I rather think that what I most ad- 
mired in Keats were his pluck and thorough 
abhorrence of what after my friend Thomas 
Carlyle we now call 'shams.' " He assures us 
that Moore "was thoroughly a manly fellow, 
and except on certain rare occasions, utterly de- 
void of pretension and affectation" an assur- 
ance the latter part of which the reader of the 
melodist's journal will perhaps modify a little. 
The senescent Godwin he pictures as more human 
than we might have surmised, and he throws in 
the touching sentence: "I rather fancied that 
he liked me because I had known poor Shelley and 
his wife." He finds sterling qualities in Beau 
Brummell. He shows anew how genuinely the 
great-hearted Scott was affected by his environ- 
ment. He deplores the impression that Words- 
worth, in his later years, "was a circumspect, 
cold-hearted man." Most delightful of all his 
portraits is that of Hartley Coleridge, of which 
no adequate idea may be had unless the reader 
consults it for himself. 

MacFarlane cherishes few grudges. He read- 
ily forgives Charles Knight, who brought him 
to financial ruin. Yet he sometimes interprets 
harshly. He is severe toward Campbell, unspar- 
ing of De Quincey, vindictive toward Harriet 
Martineau and Macaulay. "Of the ill-favoured, 
dogmatizing, masculine spinster" he quotes ap- 
provingly the dictum of John Wilson Croker in 
the "Quarterly": "The false, foul, and unfem- 
inine pen of Miss Martineau." His acquaint- 
ance with Impey, whom Macaulay pillories in 
the essay on Warren Hastings, and with many 
of the documents in the case, may account in 
part for his virulence toward the "right hon. 
lampooner . . . whom people persist in calling 
the Historian, although with him History is little 
more than a romance and a political satire." 
But the surer clue lies elsewhere. MacFarlane, 



520

travelled and experienced as he was, was pro- 
nouncedly conservative. He hated any signs of 
departure from Anglicanism, he loathed the 
Whigs, he looked upon the passage of the Re- 
form Bill as an event which would send the 
country and the future to the dogs. It seems 
hard for him, with all his personal charity, to 
do justice to a man of liberal temper. Not that 
he was as reactionary as many other men of the 
age. Yet he was reactionary enough for us to 
have doubts about his fairness to Pole-loving 
Campbell ("Freedom shrieked when Kosciuszko 
fell"), to De Quincey with his "solemn cant," 
to religion - baiting, political - economy - lauding 
Harriet Martineau, to Macaulay the Whig, and 
the rest. And we should give greater weight to 
his approval of Shelley, Wordsworth, and God- 
win if he did not himself assure us that Shelley 
was becoming orthodox, Wordsworth was no 
longer given to indiscretions, and Godwin had 
lost his religious and political radicalism. Hon- 
est and candid as MacFarlane is, we must reckon 
with this bias in his nature in deciding whether 
his interpretation of a given personality is just 
and sound. GARLAND GREEVER. 



A Nucleus of ff^orld Organization 

THE ENGLISH-SPEAKING PEOPLES. Their Future 

Relations and Joint International Obligations. 

By George Louis Beer. (The Macmillan Co.; 

$1.50.) 

Now and again the full-flowing stream of war 
literature bears to the reviewer's desk a volume 
of substantial and lasting worth. Such a book 
is Mr. Beer's "English-Speaking Peoples," con- 
taining the most penetrating analysis of past and 
present Anglo-American relations that has yet 
been made, and discussing with peculiar sanity 
the future duties and dealings of the several 
great branches of the English-speaking family. 

Upwards of twenty-five years ago the question 
of a formal political connection between the Brit- 
ish Empire and the United States was debated 
with much seriousness in certain circles on both 
sides of the Atlantic. The final word was ut- 
tered by Captain A. T. Mahan in a thoughtful 
essay wherein he laid all due stress on the nu- 
merous and important bonds of sympathy and 
interest between the English and the American 
peoples, but declared that the ground was not 
yet prepared "in the hearts and understandings" 
of Americans, and probably not in those of Brit- 
ish citizens. As Mr. Beer rightly says, strong 



unifying forces have been at work during this 
quarter-century, and particularly since 1914, and 
the question of the future relations of the two 
peoples has taken on an entirely different aspect. 
It is not assumed that a political reunion is any 
more feasible to-day than it was in 1894, and 
Mr. Beer does not undertake to discuss that ques- 
tion. But he does seek to explain (to use his 
own words) "the advisability and necessity of a 
cooperative democratic alliance of all the Eng- 
lish-speaking peoples, from which may possibly 
in time be developed such a new type of perma- 
nent political association." 

The discussion begins with a trenchant analy- 
sis of the shortcomings of the modern system of 
sovereign states a system which the writer 
frankly characterizes as "international anarchy." 
Not only is the present cataclysm the outcome 
of a system which sets off nations one against 
another and enshrouds interstate intercourse 
with a "murky atmosphere of fear and suspi- 
cion," but so long as the community of states 
remains unorganized, the "will to war" of one 
of its members will always be able to thwart 
the pacific purposes of the majority. Interna- 
tional law, arbitral machinery, "ententes," and 
understandings all must fail to save the world 
from being a great armed camp, so long as the 
nations refuse to yield their jealous separatism 
and to give up the notion that they, as sovereign 
states, must demand from their citizens supreme 
and undivided dedication. It is plausibly argued 
that no nation, particularly under present-day 
conditions, can really be fully self-controlling 
(that is, fully sovereign), and that a more gen- 
eral recognition of this fact would have the 
wholesome effect of causing states to relax their 
rigid attitudes toward their neighbors. 

Mr. Beer's main point is that this sort of re- 
laxation is to be expected first from nations that 
have longest been on good terms, and that have 
most in common. The English-speaking nations 
best meet this condition ; hence the plea is for the 
initiation of the new type of internationalism by 
and among these nations. Gradually, it is hoped, 
the idea will commend itself elsewhere; and 
finally the whole civilized world may attain such 
a measure of organization as to make great catas- 
trophes like the present war forever impossible. 

The major portion of the book is taken up with 
a description of our foreign policy before and 
during the war, and with an inquiry into the ex- 
tent and character of the unity of the English- 
speaking peoples, with a view to ascertaining 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



521 



how far these peoples now are from the mu- 
tually trustful attitude required for the inter- 
national reorganization that is advocated. The 
judgment passed on the American policy of sep- 
aratism is severe. "Almost, if not equally, as dis- 
astrous to the civilization of the world as are 
the aims and acts of Germany, was the tradi- 
tional attitude of the United States which, im- 
mersed in concern for its own peace and liberty, 
had until 1917 adhered to a policy of 'no for- 
eign entanglements' outside the western hemi- 
sphere that is tantamount to a repudiation of 
all responsibility for maintaining justice and 
right in interstate relations other than such as 
directly affected the American continents." The 
United States is, accordingly, held to a degree of 
negative responsibility for the present war, and it 
is declared that the contest has given the death 
blow to the country's cherished policy of isolation 
by demonstrating what ought to have been 
plain before that the traditional course of non- 
intervention is impossible in a highly interdepen- 
dent world. 

In the author's opinion, the time has come for 
a permanent English-speaking alliance an alli- 
ance not of Great Britain and the United States 
alone, but of all the English-speaking peoples of 
the world, so that the great self-governing do- 
minions of Canada, Australia, and South Africa 
will have their clearly defined and proper places 
in it. In a final chapter the reasons for such an 
alliance are succinctly set forth. They run sub- 
stantially as follows: (1) the English-speaking 
peoples have a deep and lasting inheritance of 
common speech, ideas, institutions, purposes, and 
methods; (2) upon them will fall, in a peculiar 
degree, the task of economic rehabilitation after 
the war, requiring the closest cooperation; (3) 
their security is dependent on a preponderance 
of sea power, which they can more economically 
maintain in collaboration than separately; (4) 
the two fundamentals of American foreign pol- 
icy which are likely to survive the present con- 
flict that is, the Monroe Doctrine and Chinese 
integrity have heretofore been powerfully sup- 
ported by British good-will, and can best be 
maintained in the future with the aid of that 
valuable force; (5) the alliance would mean an 
accumulation of strength such as would avert 
the danger of preparedness in any of the coun- 
tries growing into militarism; (6) the English- 
speaking peoples must form the central element 
in a League to, Enforce Peace, or any similar 



international organization having as its object 
the discouragement of war. 

Mr. Beer's argument is logical and forceful. 
He has scrupulous regard for the facts of history 
and economics; his views are the outcome of a 
lifetime of study of British imperial and colonial 
affairs and of international politics. Many, per- 
haps most, of his readers will shrink from' his 
conclusions. Even to-day the proposal that the 
United States adopt a settled policy of foreign 
alliances is somewhat startling. But no one will 
be justified in withholding from this book the 
tribute of candid and thoughtful consideration. 
To a world in chaos such a piece of constructive 
reasoning and planning should be welcome.

The Story of a Failure 

THE RISE OF DAVID LEVINSKY. By Abraham 
Cahan. (Harper & Brothers; $1.60.) 

Fifteen or twenty years ago there appeared 
in the magazines some remarkable stories of the 
East Side of New York by Abraham Cahan. 
They were not of the crudely comic type of 
Potash and Perlmutter, nor were they in the 
somewhat finer mood of sentimental humor which 
made the late Myra Kelly deservedly popular. 
They were humorous and pathetic in a quiet, 
compelling way, with a gentle austerity of tone 
even less familiar to American readers then than 
it is in the days of the Russian invasion. Mr. 
Howells praised these stories and he and others 
in editorial authority encouraged the author to 
write more. A career in the pleasant art of 
fiction was open to Mr. Cahan. But he with- 
drew from it and, so far as I know, he has 
written no more stories for at least ten years. 
He has devoted his energy to building up the 
great Jewish daily "Forward," which is not only 
the voice of the East Side, but a powerful vehicle 
of social and political ideals that have not yet 
penetrated the capitalistic sanctums of Times 
Square and Nassau Street. 

Now, as he approaches sixty, Mr. Cahan gives 
us this solid, mature novel, into which are com- 
pacted the reflections of a lifetime. The notice 
on the wrapper calls it "a story of success in 
the turmoil of American life." Probably the 
writer of those words intended to help the book 
by the appeal which "success" makes to the 
American mind, for no reader, not even a pub- 
lisher's clerk, could miss the immense irony of 



522 



THE DIAL 



[November 22 



the story. It is indeed the story of a failure. 
The vanity of great riches was never set forth 
with more searching sincerity. The helplessness 
of the individual, even the strong and prosperous, 
in the economic whirlpool, the loneliness and 
disillusionment only partly assuaged by pride in 
commercial achievement, the sacrifice of the intel- 
lectual life to the practical, these are the funda- 
mental themes of the book. Levinsky, with the 
instincts of a scholar and a desire for the finest 
things in life, is swept into business by circum- 
stances which he hardly understands himself and 
against which he is powerless; once in the game 
he makes the most of his abilities, but he never 
ceases to regard his visible good fortune as poor 
compensation for the invisible things he has 
missed. His wealth forces him to associate with 
all that is vulgar and acquisitive in Jewry and 
isolates him from all that is idealistic. He finds 
that he cannot even speak the language of the 
woman he most admires. Worse still, he is out 
of sympathy with the aspirations of millions of 
poor Jews from whose ranks he has sprung. He 
has no sympathy with those who would break 
the game up or make new rules, yet he sees that 
the game is hardly worth playing, even for the 
winner. "Success! Success! Success! It was 
the almighty goddess of the hour. Thousands of 
new fortunes were advertising her gaudy splen- 
dors. Newspapers, magazines, and public speeches 
were full of her glory, and he who found favor 
in her eyes found favor in the eyes of man." 

The portrait of David Levinsky is a portrait 
of society, not simply of the Jewish section of 
it, or of New York, but of American business. 
And business is business whether done by Jew 
or Gentile. If Levinsky is a triumphant failure, 
he is so because American business, which shaped 
him to its ends, is, viewed from any decent 
regard for humanity, a miserable monster of suc- 
cess. Not that Levinsky is an abstraction, or 
that the novelist is forcing a thesis. Far from 
it. The personality of Mr. Levinsky is as sharply 
individualized as the hero of Meredith's "One of 
Our Conquerors," though with a different kind 
of subtlety, the subtlety not of detached analysis, 
but of naively simple self-revelation, which of 
course is not so simple as it sounds. 

Mr. Cahan is an artist; he knows how to 
think through his characters, by letting them do 
the thinking, as if it were their affair and not 
his. At the same time he does not perform (nor 
does any other artist) that foolish and meaning- 



less operation, as expressed by a great poet through 
a young critic, of holding "the mirror up to 
nature." Nature in a mirror is just nature, not 
nature thought out, excogitated, turned to human 
uses, interpreted in human words. And this is 
the place to say that Mr. Cahan knows how to 
use words. There are no great phrases in this 
book. A simple and (intellectually) honest busi- 
ness man writing his autobiography would not 
use a great phrase ; such a phrase might issue from 
some enviable person in that intellectual life 
from which Levinsky was excluded. But there 
is no banal or inept phrase. Such a man as 
Mr. Cahan intends Levinsky to be, a man 
trained in the Talmud, which means verbal 
sense, and hammered by the facts of life, which 
means a sense of reality, and a wistful failure, 
which means imaginative retrospection, says 
things in a direct, firm, accurate style. There is 
no lack of emotion ; strong feeling, expressed or 
implied, runs through the book from beginning 
to end. But there is a complete absence of elo- 
quence, a deliberate refraining from emphasis, 
an even manner of setting forth ideas and events 
impartially for the value inherent in them, an 
admirable method, the method of a philosophic 
artist. Here is life; some of it is good, some of 
it is bad ; it is all somewhat pitiable, to be laughed 
at rather than cried over; nobody is deserving of 
indignant blame or abuse. It is our business to 
understand it as well as we can; and though we 
never can see it in its entirety or with complete 
clearness, if we make an honest effort to record 
events and delineate personalities, the events will 
arrange themselves in a more or less intelligible 
sequence, and the personalities will be their 
own commentary upon themselves. An obvious 
method, but you will read many a book to find 
one skilful application of it. 

It seems to me the method most often employed 
and carried to the highest degree of perfection 
by the great Russians. I am driven to the timid- 
ity of "seems" by my friend H. L. Mencken, 
who reminds us in his bluff-calling manner that 
we do much talking about Russian novels with- 
out having read many of them or understanding 
what we have read. But better-informed critics 
than I have noted that one characteristic of the 
Russian novel is a benevolent impartiality in its 
treatment of all kinds of people and a calm con- 
templation of events horrible, gay, sad, comic. A 
revolutionist can portray, in fiction, a commis- 
sioner of police, whom in real life he would be 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



523 



willing to kill, with a fairness that is more than 
fair, with a combination of Olympian serenity 
and human sympathy. He can be a virulent 
propagandist when he is writing pamphlets, and 
when he writes fiction he can forget his propa- 
ganda or subdue it to art, that is, to a balanced 
sense of life. A remarkable case is Tolstoy's 
"Resurrection." Tolstoy had given up art as a 
bad job and had been for years a zealous prop- 
agandist, benevolent and philosophic, to be sure, 
but exaggerated and distorted. He had fallen 
under the influence of Henry George and the 
single-tax idea (because he, like George, lived in 
a country where the chief economic problem was 
agrarian). When he came to write "Resurrec- 
tion," he made his hero a protagonist of the 
single-tax theory. A propagandist who was not 
an artist would have made that theory succeed 
in the book. Success in fiction is cheap and easy. 
But Tolstoy, an artist that is, a man with a 
feeling for the facts of life made the idea fail 
before the conservatism of the peasants whom the 
idea was intended to benefit. That is honesty 
in art. 

When I say that Mr. Cahan's novel sounds 
like a good translation of a Russian novel, and 
that he is a disciple of the Russian novelists, I 
accuse him of the crime of being an artist and a 
seer. As a matter of biography, he is a child of 
Russian literature. And that is why his novel, 
written in faultless English, is a singular and soli- 
tary performance in American fiction. If that 
strange demand for "the" or "a great American 
novel," a demand which is at once foolish and 
the expression of a justifiably proud feeling that a 
big country ought to have big books, is to be 
satisfied, perhaps we shall have to ask an East 
Side Jew to write it for us. That would be an 
interesting phenomenon for some future Profes- 
sor Wendell to deal with in a History of Ameri- 
can Literature. And by the way, Mr. Cahan is a 
competent critic. I hope he will give us not only 
more novels, but a study of Russian literature 
for the enlightenment of the American mind. 
I remember with gratitude an article of his 
which I read when I was even more ignorant 
than I am now, on the modern successors to the 
group of Titans, Turgenev, Tolstoy, Dostoev- 
sky. He put Maxim Gorky in his place and 
told us (this was before the Russian invasion) 
about Andreyev and Chekhov. If Mr. Cahan 
will write a book on Russian literature, I will 
do my best to establish him in his merited place

BOOKS AND PERSONS. By Arnold Bennett. (George 
H. Doran Co.; $2.) 

Here you are face to face with a professional 
"a tremendous and omniscient expert," to bor- 
row one of Arnold Bennett's own thumping 
phrases. In our American world of salesmen and 
brokers, Mr. Bennett would indubitably have 
been known as a "live wire." Easy to imagine 
other brokers hanging on his lips, waiting for 
the golden word that might turn out to be an 
invaluable tip and the first stage on the road 
to fortune. I do not mean to be disrespectful; 
I mean to be complimentary. Mr. Bennett has 
taken the trouble to know his business from the 
ground up rather than from the clouds down, 
and that in itself is quite sufficient to give any 
real artist distinction in the world of letters. 
He knows the technical side and the publishing 
side, and he has taken the trouble to formulate 
a pretty definite notion of the public for which 
he writes. He is sufficiently alive to be keenly 
and not superciliously interested in all the gossip 
going, and he does not pretend to disdain trivial- 
ities. He did not begin to be an artist by the 
aristocratic process of exclusion or elimination, 
and even if we are obliged to regard his peculiar 
case as one of the happy cases of dual personality 
and to think of him as, so to speak, a two-fisted 
writer, that doesn't in the least invalidate the 
message he has to give to the novice. That most 
novices will be inclined to mistake his sanity for 
cynicism and resent the cool grays in his picture 
of the literary life, makes no difference what- 
ever. 

The base on which Mr. Bennett's talent rests 
is common sense. Some people complain that 
that is precisely what is the matter with him, 
by which they mean to indicate, I suppose, that 
his work is not sufficiently irradiated with imag- 
ination. They feel cheated, let down, forced to 
live too much on one plane and in the mood 
of Monday morning. Well, I confess that one 
does feel that sometimes in the novels, especially 
in the famous trilogy; there are vast, arid 
stretches in "Hilda Lessways" and I think there 
are some even in "The Old Wives' Tale." There 
is often something mechanical and galvanic about 
the simulation of romantic ecstasy especially 
when it is a question of the illusions of youth. 
The exclamation point bends under the burden it 
has to support. But as critic, Mr. Bennett almost 
always recognizes a work of authentic imagina- 
tion when he sees it ; nor is his enthusiasm 



524 



THE DIAL 



[November 22 



rendered less happily infectious by the fact that 
he tolerates no nonsense and begins by as- 
suming that the production of masterpieces is 
something more than "inspirational hypersthe- 
nia." 

The present volume is made up of selections 
from the cauteries he contributed to "The New 
Age" during the years 1908-11, under the name 
of "Jacob Tonson." The range is considerable, 
giving Mr. Bennett's reactions to publishers, the 
public, the literary agent, the prevalence of cant, 
and so on; but I think the book is chiefly inter- 
esting as a record of the casual judgments 
casual in form only of a tremendous expert on 
his fellow-craftsmen. Such judgments are always 
immensely stimulating even if they aren't (as 
Mr. Bennett is fond of pretending) the only 
judgments worth listening to. They are usually 
more provocative and enlivening than elaborate 
criticism, for they may be as these are quite 
innocent of rhetoric, and rhetoric can be an ap- 
palling spoil-sport. It suggests embalming fluid. 
The liveliest idea, treated with rhetoric, often 
takes on the vacuous placidity of a corpse. Here, 
on the other hand, we get the writer's enthu- 
siasms and exasperations, his forethoughts and 
afterthoughts, and even his profanity. All of 
which is precisely as it should be in a causerie 
that is often no more than an expanded para- 
graph. 

So far as Mr. Bennett's enthusiasms are con- 
cerned, most of them were quite easy for a man 
of taste writing in 1908 Chekhov, Dostoevsky, 
Conrad (whom he only, to be sure, defends 
against the ineptitude of the "Athenaeum"), 
H. G. Wells. What he says about Mr. Ches- 
terton seems to me altogether just and not too 
severe; Mr. Chesterton's dogmatic orthodoxy, 
coming at this time of day, stamps his mind, 
for all its brilliancy, as second-rate. (Since the 
beginning of the war it has been absolutely third- 
rate, when it hasn't been in abeyance.) Nor 
are his remarks on the later Rudyard Kipling too 
drastic. Some would object to them as socio- 
logical. The crux of the matter is Kipling's at- 
titude to the English land system. "To read 
this story one could never guess that the English 
land system is not absolutely ideal, that tenants 
and hereditary owners do not live always in a 
delightful patriarchal relation, content. There 
are no shadows whatever." But what Mr. Ben- 
nett is objecting to is not Kipling's tory com- 
placency; it is his blindness a very serious 
disability in an artist. 



We are working now into the region of Mr. 
Bennett's aversions. I have kept no count, but 
my impression is that the aversions are more 
numerous than the enthusiasms in this collection, 
and there can be no doubt at all that they are 
more vivacious. His judgments of doom are 
"short and shattering." Take the case of Ar- 
thur Christopher Benson a shining mark who 
has come off unscathed under a shower of arrows. 
"Much if not most of the Thread of Gold' is 
merely absurd. Some of it is pretentious, some 
of it is inept. All of it is utterly banal. All of 
it has the astounding calm assurance of medi- 
ocrity. It is a solemn thought that tens of thou- 
sands of well-dressed mortals alive and idle to-day 
consider themselves to have been uplifted by the 
perusal of this work." With Mr. Benson one 
may loosely lump such other aversions as Mrs. 
Humphry Ward, Marie Corelli, and Elinor Glyn 
all incomparable idols of the book-reading 
mob, the mob, in this sense, being composed of 
the "superior stolid comfortable," the middle- 
class props of the status quo and the invincible 
enemies of progress and art. How they dote on 
elegance! The elegant emotions of Mrs. Ward's 
heroines, and the elegant upholstery and language 
of Elinor Glyn's. As for Mrs. Ward, she knows 
her business; her novels are possibly "the best 
stuff now being swallowed by the uneducated 
public ; and they deal with the governing classes ; 
and when you have said that you have said all. 
Nothing truly serious can happen in them. It 
is all make-believe. No real danger of the truth 
about life ... I should think not indeed!" 

The chief remaining aversion of Mr. Bennett 
is the mandarin, and the most mandarinic of the 
mandarins is for him the professor. Here Mr. 
Bennett assumes the posture of the professional 
heaping scorn on the amateur. Churton Collins 
is his particular bete noire. "He had acquired 
much learning. Indeed, I should suppose that 
on the subject of literature he was the most 
learned man in Britain. Unfortunately, he was 
quite bereft of original taste. . . The frown- 
ing structure of his vast knowledge overawed 
many people, but it never overawed an artist 
unless the artist was excessively young and naive." 
And Mr. Bennett goes on "de-classing the whole 
professorial squad Bradley, Herford, Dowden, 
Walter Raleigh, Elton, Saintsbury. The first 
business of any writer, and especially of any crit- 
ical writer, is not to be mandarinic and tedious, 
and these lecturers have not yet learnt that first 
business."

THE DIAL 



525 



Indeed, Mr. Bennett's attitude to all criticism, 
whether mandarinic or not, is frankly aristocratic. 
The critic wants the special insight and sympa- 
thy that belongs to the "creative artist," and 
without that he is simply bound to flounder; 
above all, he is bound to arrive late at the feast. 
Mr. Bennett's ostentatious and persistent appro- 
priation of the title "creative artist" is not un- 
suggestive of swank, a form of self-indulgence 
with which he is on intimate terms, as he has 
shown conclusively in more than one novel. 
That is not, however, the whole story. No! 
If he is hard on the professor here and harsh 
elsewhere with the dilettante, the man who 
knows more and talks better than any creative 
artist, it is not altogether because he objects 
to the genteel tradition in criticism. Impossible 
to acquit him of a touch of envy. Not envy 
of the professor's gentility or of his eminence, 
but envy solely of the blissful amplitude of his 
leisure. What a chance to read books, all the 
books there are! Some, perhaps most, creative 
artists are quite innocent of any such envy; 
Arnold Bennett, however, is really a bookman 
and there is not a little evidence that he has 
had to remind himself now and then that the 
main business of the writer is to write and not 
to read. Such things are naturally irritating.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS 



Night on the Beach 

A bare spit of sand 

Stretches out to the dark; 

At the border of it, houses: 

Sparse-scattered blocks of obscurity. 

At the edge of it, night, 

And a surging, a moaning, 

Something clutching hard at the edge of the sand, 

Something sliding in terror away. 

Two people drift past, 

Talking in low voices ; 

They are lost, blurred shadows 

In the grey flatness. 

The heavy clouds hang in the sky 

As if they dared not go further; 

A wind scurries hastily over the sand and then 

stops. 

And beyond, 

There is something great heaving and clutching, 
And stretching out endlessly. . . 
Something greater than man, 
Something empty of life, 
Something changeless and old and alone.

PORTRAITS AND PROTESTS. By Sarah N. 

Cleghorn. Holt; $1.25. 

As a poet Miss Cleghorn's gift is a slender one, 
and lies rather in intention than in accomplish- 
ment. Her subject-matter is usually fit for 
lyrical treatment, whether it is the picture of a 
girl or a landscape or even a little social irony. 
But her manner of handling these themes is too 
completely conventional to be poetic. While the 
verses have all a distinct personal accent, they fail 
adequately to convey emotion. This is partly 
due to the fact that the author clings to lilting 
measures, intelligible for "Margerita Singing 
Ballads," but not for "Jane Addams," that she 
uses inversion frequently, permits her metrical 
feet to stumble, and has a rather tiresome fond- 
ness for flounces and roundabouts. The lack of 
intensity is perhaps also due to Miss Cleghorn's 
austere passion for New England. The portion 
of the book called "Protests" has more of prop- 
aganda value than of warm human anger in it, 
and the occasional humor is as dry as the air 
of Vermont. An instance of lyrism exceptional 
for the volume is this: 

Fields of fireflies 
Wheel all night like stars above the wheat. 

But this note on George Herbert is more 
characteristic : 

He led the wanton English Muse to church: 
The lovely pagan Muse, "well drest and clad." 
Several of the poems show a kinship with the 
shrewd talent of Emily Dickinson, but not her 
genius. The difference is significant: where the 
latter was, even on her intellectual altitudes, com- 
municative, Miss Cleghorn remains merely 
expressive. 

NEW ZEALAND IN EVOLUTION. By G. H. 

Scholefield. New Edition. Scribner; $1.75. 

"You can't tell," as the admirable Crichton 
of Mr. Barry remarked, "what will happen on 
an island." New Zealand is the most insular 
of civilized countries. It is 4000 miles from 
South America, the nearest continental land 
area, and it is divided from Australia by "an 
uninterrupted moat twelve hundred miles in 
width at its narrowest part." And a great many 
things have been happening in New Zealand. 

During the last seventy-five years the islands 
have been a sort of political experiment station 
for the rest of the world. In 1840 European 
civilization was represented by a handful of 
pioneers and perhaps 60,000 savages, among 
whom cannibalism was not yet extinct. To-day 
New Zealand is a commonwealth of a million 
middle-class souls living under the most ad- 
vanced democracy in the world. Within this 
brief period this little island nation has faced

and, humanly speaking, has solved most of the 
problems that older peoples are reluctantly be- 
ginning to consider. It had a race problem, 
which it "solved" by guaranteeing to the natives 
their rights in the soil and making of them, like 
the Indians in Oklahoma, a landlord class. It 
had a land problem, which it solved by a policy 
which has tended to make great estates unprofit- 
able and to discourage absentee ownership. It 
had a labor problem, which it met by the estab- 
lishment of a national labor bureau, a state 
farm for the unemployed, and a system of com- 
pulsory arbitration. 

It has had other problems, which it has met 
by taking its coal mines under state control, by 
the organization of a state life-insurance com- 
pany, the establishment of a state sawmill, and 
by taking over the control of the national oyster 
beds. 

Mr. Scholefield's book, which was written 
in 1909, is now published in a cheaper edition. 
At the time it was first published it was said, 
in spite of all that had been written on New 
Zealand, that nothing had been written which 
gave at once a comprehensive and consistent ac- 
count of the whole political and economic evo- 
lution of the island. This need the book met 
and nothing has since been published to take 
its place. There is a certain propriety, also, in 
the republication of the volume at this time, 
when the changes now going on in the political 
and economic organization of the world make 
the description of New Zealand's bold experi- 
ments in democracy, interesting reading. 

MILITARISM AT WORK. IN BELGIUM AND 
GERMANY. By K. G. Ossiannilsson. Un- 
win; 2s. 6d. 

In his Flag Day address President Wilson 
made passing reference to the singular zest with 
which the German people seem to submit to 
their present oppressive form of government. 
Possibly the zest is only apparent, and not real. 
Mr. Ossiannilsson depicts a highly organized 
system of ruthless repression against which pro- 
test has small chance of rising above a whisper. 
"Why has German Liberalism proved such an 
utter failure?" he asks. "Why is a double quar- 
tet allowed to sing the part which ought to 
resound with the full force of a massed choir? 
Is everything hypnotized by militarism? Is 
Germany so united in wrong-doing as we are 
made to fear and believe?" His reply is that 
the massed choir is only waiting for the leader's 
baton, but that every potential leader is made 
to disappear, in the trenches or prisons or else- 
where, as soon as the attempt to raise the baton 
is ventured. That nefarious device of Prussian 
statecraft known as Preventive Arrest throws 



suspected persons into jail under the pretense 
of benevolently protecting them from their own 
latent tendencies to evil, and in jail they remain 
until their errant impulses are overcome. The 
insufferable governmental conditions now existing 
in Belgium and, in a somewhat less degree, in 
Germany itself, are plainly, with much docu- 
mentary evidence, exposed to view; and finally 
Goethe's Egmont is aptly quoted in behalf of 
his compatriots, the sturdy Belgians, in his elo- 
quent protest against the tyrannical rule of Alba. 
Mr. H. G. Wright translates this little volume 
from the Swedish. 

RUSSIA AS I KNOW IT. By Harry de 

Windt, F.R.G.S. Lippincott; $3. 

After all the conflicting reports and interpre- 
tations of Russia, it is significant that so experi- 
enced a traveller as Mr. de Windt, having already 
written "Siberia as It Is," should discreetly call 
this work "Russia as I Know It." To have 
paralleled the former title would have been a 
hardy matter. In allowing the book to be pub- 
lished in its present form, however, the author 
risks the charge of taking undue advantage of 
the contemporary interest in things Russian. 
For, interesting as it is, the material shows every 
evidence of having been collated with less thought 
of homogeneity than of producing a book that 
would sell. 

The arrangement of subjects is curious. The 
reader is taken from Petrograd to Moscow, then 
to Finland and over to Siberia, back to Kiev, 
down to the Crimea, and finally to the Caucasus. 
Interspersed along the way are chapters on the 
moujik, the Cossack, diversions, food, and 
creeds. 

The author is at his best when he writes of 
the Russian. He pictures and characterizes, 
leaving the reader to interpret. His friend 
the moujik is the subject of a particularly 
illuminating chapter. One learns from it that 
the Russian language is spoken all over the em- 
pire (for such he still calls it) with the same 
purity of accent by plebeian and patrician alike, 
and that you can tell an aristocrat from a moujik 
more by his manners than by his speech. The 
moujik has other excellent qualities. He is hos- 
pitable, industrious, skilful, brave. Extenuation 
is found for his laxity of morals in his cramped 
and insanitary housing conditions, and if his 
clothing is unclean and vermin-infested, he at 
least wars upon the parasites by subjecting them 
to a high temperature in the kitchen-stove oven. 
According to his education and training he is 
quite an exemplary citizen, a contrast in a variety 
of ways to the rich Siberian of whom the author 
was once a guest. The Siberian owned priceless 
pictures and other artistic treasures, horses and 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



carriages, and conservatories of rare orchids. His 
bedroom was furnished in Louis XV style by a 
famous Parisian decorator, yet he slept every 
night, fully dressed, on three chairs. 

Evidently Mr. de Windt has not been in Russia 
very recently, for usually he tempers any positive 
statement regarding a condition that may have 
been changed by the revolution with a footnote 
or parenthesis such as "or was (or did) under 
the Empire." It is difficult to believe, however, 
that this care was exercised in the assertions that 
there are fifty breweries in operation throughout 
Finland, that the Russian ballet is the finest in 
Europe, or that the revolutionary youth of both 
sexes are easily recognized, as they affect an eccen- 
tric style of dress. Enough of ante-bellum Russia 
must of necessity remain, however, to give the 
book some lasting value in spite of its blemishes, 
for it is mostly about people, and human nature 
does not change with politics. 

THE LADIES OF DANTE'S LYRICS. By 
Charles Hall Grandgent. Harvard Uni- 
versity Press; $1.35. 

The most obvious parallels which come to 
one's mind in reading these studies are two 
works of Dante himself, the "New Life" and 
the "Banquet," where the poet frames a certain 
number of his lyrics in a prose commentary. 
Professor Grandgent has translated the major- 
ity of Dante's short poems, grouped them to 
show their probable relation to one another, and 
surrounded them with all the exegesis that keen 
critical insight can offer. At first the reader is 
captivated by the charm of the style and the 
translations of the lyrics; it is only on reflec- 
tion that he becomes aware of the masterly in- 
terpretation, based on long study of all Dante's 
works. In the first chapter, entitled "Violetta" 
after one of the more shadowy of the ladies, 
there is a discussion of Italian poetry contem- 
porary with Dante and of the evolution in his 
own manner, through rather conventional ama- 
tory verse, to the dolce stil nuovo, with its mys- 
tic idealism. The remaining studies deal with 
Matelda, the lovely symbol of youth in the 
earthly paradise, with Pietra, who inspired some 
of the most wildly beautiful of the lyrics, with 
Beatrice, and with Lisetta, possibly the lady of 
the window, who occupied some place in the 
poet's mind, as he says, after the death of 
Beatrice. None of the figures can be positively 
identified, though Professor Grandgent believes 
that each one is the idealized image of some 
woman known to Dante. In general the poems 
point to a tendency which seems to have been 
characteristic of the author. "First Dante's 
fancy is stirred by a real person; then, having 



come to regard this person as a symbol of some- 
thing abstract, he little by little loses conscious- 
ness of the reality and consecrates himself to the 
cult of the symbol. Having reached this last 
stage, he believes, or tries to persuade himself, 
that the whole experience has been an allegory." 

How TO STUDY ARCHITECTURE. By 
Charles Henry Caffin. Dodd, Mead ; $3.50. 

Mr. Caffin's object is to treat architecture as 
a live art one which grows out of both the 
needs and the ideals of life. He gives much 
more heed than is common in books of this type 
to the considerations religious, philosdphical, 
social, political, and economical that have in- 
fluenced architecture among various peoples in 
various ages; and he is constantly, consistently 
concerned with architectural works as organic 
growths. His book, like most of its kind, labors 
through the ages to bring things down to us and 
to our day; what is aside from the main line of 
advance to that goal is omitted. Thus the archi- 
tecture of the Orient China, Japan, India is 
passed by: the gate recently opened to eastern 
painting and other arts is not yet wide enough 
to admit eastern building. On the other hand, 
Mr. Caffin has a sufficing chapter on Minoan 
architecture, based upon the excavations of Evans 
and others in Crete; and thus he closes up the 
hiatus long felt between the architecture of 
Egypt and that of Greece, besides accounting 
more clearly for remains like those at Mycenae 
and Tiryns. He endeavors to appraise the value 
of individual buildings, as well as of national 
schools of building, and he stands throughout 
on the basis of organic structure and develop- 
ment. As but few peoples have been able to 
compass in their architecture a happy balance of 
logical and emotional elements, Mr. Caffin now 
and then is naturally "put to his stumps." Thus, 
Roman architecture, in its aesthetic aspects, was 
largely an overlaying of native construction with 
Greek decoration, quite illogically applied: if 
the Romans are to be praised, it must be mostly 
as organizers on a grand scale and as engineers 
of great energy and audacity. Again, if we 
are to enjoy the architecture of the Renaissance, 
at which time the master-builder was succeeded 
by the architect (in the modern sense), we 
must regard its examples as works of pictorial 
design rather than as creations based on organic 
functioning. And what of the characteristic 
American architecture of the present day the 
steel-cage construction clothed in stone, brick, 
or terra cotta draperies lifted at random from 
all historical periods? Well, we must be indul- 
gent here, too. We turn with a little sigh of 
relief to the Greeks, the Byzantines, and the 
mediaeval cathedral-builders, peoples of three

periods who were able to bring about a complete 
fusion of fine feeling and clear thinking. Mr. 
Caffin makes concessions but does not yield 
ground. For the rest, his book offers throughout 
a sufficiency of practical detail for the student 
and the amateur; and the illustrations, many 
of which are unhackneyed, invariably illustrate 
the points he is intent upon making. 

OLD ROADS OUT OF PHILADELPHIA. By 
John T. Paris. Lippincott ; $4. 

Ten famous highways and their rich historical 
and legendary associations form the subject of 
Mr. Faris's agreeably discursive volume. These 
roads, favorites with automobilists and, formerly 
at least, with equestrians and pedestrians, are the 
King's Highway to Wilmington, the Baltimore, 
the West Chester, and the Lancaster Turnpikes, 
and the Gulph, the Ridge, the Germantown, the 
Bethlehem, the York, and the Bristol Roads, 
stretching out, collectively, somewhat like the 
radiating sticks of an open fan, with the Dela- 
ware River serving as the outside sticks and the 
city hall as the central pivot on which the sticks 
turn. No other city presents such a number of 
radiating highways passing through scenes of 
such varied beauty and historical interest. It was 
a happy thought to make them the subject of a 
book, and with much curious lore has the subject 
been enriched, showing diligence and no little 
original research in the treatment. Historical, 
genealogical, and literary items of note sprinkle 
the pages. 

WEIGHTS AND MEASURES. By Franklin 
P. Adams. Doubleday, Page & Co. $1. 

The worth of a jest is said to lie in the ears 
of him that hears it. Franklin P. Adams is 
enough of a psychologist to know this axiom, and 
he plays on the joy of recognition to gain 
much of his deserved applause. He chooses 
his audience, and gives its members things to 
gloat over which will waken familiar echoes in 
their brains, as well as delight them with his 
own happy wit. This audience is, however, 
catholic. It should know its classics, Horace, 
Catullus, Propertius, as it knows its Irving Ber- 
lin and its Arnold Bennett. It should rejoice 
in things carnal, prefer tennis to toil, and have 
human sympathies withal, appreciating the 
righteous resentment of the ditch-digger against 
the plutocrat in a motor. 

This latest volume is rich in parodies, most 
of them so nice as to be exquisitely funny. Es- 
pecially good are those which at once parody and 
reply to such poets as Amy Lowell, Sara Teas- 
dale, and Owen Seaman. But there are other 
bits which do not depend on any reference for 
their humor. Such are the "Strange Cases" of 



people whose fate is surprisingly what one would 
expect it to be, if one had not been led by pop- 
ular fiction ists to expect the unexpected; the 
sweet, sardonic thumb-nail sketches of such no- 
tables as Mrs. Vernon Castle and Gaby Deslys; 
and verses like the pathetic plea to W. Hohen- 
zollern, which concludes: 

Sue then for peace! And let the skies be fair again! 

The Polo Grounds' most ardent eager tenant 
Was I. . . And, William, how I yearn to care 
again 

About such things as who will win the penant!" 

Besides his funniness, which depends as much 
on his assumptions of intimacy as on a gentle 
irony, Mr. Adams is felicitous in his use of 
exacting metres and involved rhyme-schemes. 
He takes a certain joy in overcoming technical 
difficulties, though he does not scruple to split 
a word for the rhyme's sake, and then he seems 
to take you into his confidence regarding the 
poet's problem. Most choice is his use of slang 
in paraphrasing Latin. Even his titles are 
mirth-provoking: "Vides, ut alta stet nive 
candidum . . ." is entitled "The Cold Wave 
of 32 B.C."; "Vixi puellis nuper idoneus . . ." 
is immortalized as "When Q. H. F. Sang 'Good- 
bye Girls.' " The quality of these translations 
may be seen in this version of "Vitas hinuleo 
me similis, Chloe": 

Chloe, regard my song sententious 

And trust me as your soul's director: 
No longer be a conscientious 
Objector. 

No lion, I, to feast upon 

You, Chloe. Do not be so distant. 
Forget your mother. Be a non- 
Resistarft. 

THE ORDER OF NATURE. By Lawrence J. 
Henderson. Harvard University Press. 

In the recent thoughtful and stimulating work 
of this author on "The Fitness of the Environ- 
ment" emphasis was laid upon the fitness of the 
inorganic world for life. This is shown in cer- 
tain fundamental stabilities of the chemical and 
physical environment, in the equable temperature 
of the earth, in the constancy of alkalinity in the 
ocean, and in the regularity of currents in the 
atmosphere and the ocean. Again the mobilization 
of the chemical resources of the earth and their 
marvelous freedom of movement depend upon the 
unique properties of water. Thus the primary 
constituents of the environment, water and car- 
bonic acid, serve with maximum efficiency to 
make stable, durable, and complex both the liv- 
ing thing itself and the world around it. No 
other chemical substances could possibly replace 
them. The actual environment is thus the fittest 
possible abode of life, as we know it, in all its 
physical and chemical characteristics. Fitness of

the environment is as constant a component of 
any particular case of adaptation as is the fit- 
ness of the organism itself. The very nature of 
matter and energy, of space and time, imposes 
certain general characteristics upon the organism 
which result in that mutual fitness which we call 
adaptation. The author maintains that a hith- 
erto unrecognized order exists among the proper- 
ties of matter, and one which makes things what 
they are. These peculiarities are not evenly dis- 
tributed among all the compounds of the chem- 
ical elements, nor are they apportioned according 
to the laws of chance, nor again by any conform- 
ity to the periodic system of the elements. The 
unique properties of hydrogen, oxygen, and car- 
bon bring about stability of physical and chem- 
ical conditions, diversity of phenomena, and the 
possibility of complexity, durability, and activity 
of physico-chemical systems on the planet. Static 
analysis masks this order, which becomes evident 
only when time is taken into account. It is the 
author's effort in the present work to establish 
the importance of these three chemical elements 
for the process of cosmic evolution including that 
of organisms, resting his conclusions on what he 
calls the secure foundations of abstract physical 
science with the elimination of all mere biological 
theories. But Hamlet is gone from the play. 
Does abstract physical science include within its 
sure grasp all those properties of the organism 
with its ceaseless flux of matter and flow of 
energy and its cyclic persistence through the lapse 
of time? The author then ventures to "sketch 
the development of thought upon the problem 
of teleology, and at length to confront the scien- 
tific conclusions with the results of philosophical 
thought, in order finally to attempt a reconcilia- 
tion." Appendices to the discussion include 
James Clerk Maxwell's classic essay on "Deter- 
minism and Free-Will" and Fechner's on "The 
Tendency to Stability." 

CAMP-FIRE VERSE. Chosen by Williams 
Haynes and Joseph LeRoy Harrison, with 
an introduction by Stewart Edward White. 
Duffield; $1.25. 

This collection is unique and interesting, and 
is one which any lover of camp life may be glad 
to have on his shelves. At the same time, it offers 
great temptation to the usual criticism of a book 
of selections that the editors have neither 
put in nor left out the right things. The pref- 
ace says: "We have tried to exclude all poems 
not conceived in the true spirit of the sportsman 
and to include no poems devoid of literary merit. 
Accordingly, some beautiful poems, sure of their 
place in literature, have been omitted as poetry 
rather of the library lamp by the study fireplace 
than of the crackling campfire beneath the stars; 



and some verse, very true in its sporting spirit, 
has been discarded as doggerel." But, though 
Whittier and Thoreau were in a sense "literary 
fellers," some of their verse surely has the genu- 
ine breath of out-of-doors; neither is represented, 
nor is Joaquin Miller, nor Dr. van Dyke, nor 
Stevenson. Kipling and more strangely in view 
of the tone of the book Robert W. Service 
have but one poem each. Most of the pieces are 
by authors who are, to the present reviewer at 
least, unknown, and many of them are of the 
undistinguished sort that serve as space-fillers in 
the better sporting magazines. Some of the dog- 
gerel, if it is clever doggerel, which the compil- 
ers so conscientiously excluded might have added 
a pleasing variety. Mr. White's introduction is 
of the sort that is written by request, and his one 
original generalization, that "With Kipling's 
'Feet of the Young Men' as a sort of dividing 
line, later [out-of-door] verse takes an entirely 
new attitude and you don your khaki," might be 
questioned. 

PLAYS FOR A NEGRO THEATRE. Granny 

Maumee; The Rider of Dreams; Simon 

the Cyrenian. By Ridgely Torrence. Mac- 

millan; $1.50. 

Most of the people who interest themselves in 
the cause of the black man spend their time try- 
ing to prove him less black than he is painted. 
The metaphysics of William Blake's little black 
boy, "But, Oh! my soul is white," is accepted 
(though no one really believes in it) as an 
apology for all negrodom, when the sensible, and 
one would think the obvious, way of securing 
justice for the dark-skinned races would be to 
prove that black souls have a value, intrinsic and 
discrete, that makes them worth considering on 
their own merits. 

By establishing in New York a theatre in 
which plays of negro life are presented by negroes, 
Ridgely Torrence may be earning for himself 
the laurels of a second emancipator; for it is 
quite conceivable that such a theatre may do as 
much toward making America understand the 
negro soul as the Irish Literary Movement 
especially the Abbey Theatre has done toward 
acquainting a portion at least of the English- 
speaking world with the soul of Cathleen ni 
Houlihan. Indeed, the three plays that Mr. Tor- 
rence has just published are strangely reminis- 
cent of the Irish plays. They have all the faults 
of the latter, they are perhaps even a shade 
more loose and amateurish, but they have about 
them the gracious honesty of a primitive people, 
a refreshing contrast to sophistication's steelier, 
more intellectual truth. 

The negro theatre is a folk theatre and its 
plays are folk plays. They are chronicles of a

simple, childlike people, full of naive, super- 
stitious religion and rude poetry and still within 
sound of the savage tom-tom. The least effec- 
tive of the three plays in Mr. Torrence's volume 
is "Simon the Cyrenian," a symbolic play of the 
time of Christ, built upon the legend that the 
bearer of the cross was a negro. The most effec- 
tive is "The Rider of Dreams," the story of a 
charming, "no 'count nigger." Miscegenation, 
lynching, the exploitation of the negro by the 
white all these appear in the plays, not as prop- 
aganda, but rather as facts of life, unalterable 
and merciless as birth and death. Mr. Torrence 
does not plead for the black man and he does not 
apologize for him. He simply presents him, one 
feels truly, as he is. "All I wants is room to 
dream my good dreams an' make my own music." 
So says Mr. Torrence's playboy, the incorrigible 
rider of dreams. That is, of course, what most 
of us want and few of us get. The world crowds 
in, even upon the white but it tramples the 
negro, whose dreams it does not even vaguely 
understand. Is it too soon to hope that the negro 
theatre may act as an interpreter? 

ILLINOIS. By Allan Nevins. Oxford Uni- 
versity Press; $2. 

The series to which this book belongs shows 
it to be, not a history of the Prairie State, but 
a record of the rise and progress of the youngest 
of the state universities of the old Northwest 
Territory. It is appropriate that this first his- 
tory of the University of Illinois should make 
its appearance in the semi-centennial year of that 
institution, though the fact that the book thus cel- 
ebrates the completion of a memorable half-cen- 
tury in Illinois educational progress is, strangely 
enough, not even referred to in the preface, nor 
does it appear to receive any emphasis elsewhere 
in the volume. This omission, however, may be 
due to the author's modesty, and certainly is not 
to be included among those "shortcomings" for 
which he asks indulgence, briefly indicating the 
difficulties of his task a task executed nearly a 
thousand miles from the scene with which it is 
concerned and generously acknowledging the 
assistance received from many sources far less 
remote, geographically. A rough division of the 
university's history might have been made, into 
two equal periods of a quarter-century each, the 
first marked by slow and painful progress, the 
latter with a splendid record of increasingly 
rapid advance. But the book does present very 
forcibly the contrast between earlier unsuccess and 
later achievement at least in a material sense. 
Perhaps a little more credit might justly have 
been accorded to those who won the less spec- 
tacular victories of the difficult first years, those 
who fought for ideals more than for legislative 



appropriations and new buildings. Dr. Peabody, 
the university's second head ( Regent he was then 
called) thus deserves high praise, and in part 
receives it; but there seems to be a contradiction 
in terms in the statement that "he cared little 
for expansion but much for perfection, little for 
numbers but much for size and efficiency." In 
describing Peabody's successor, President Draper, 
the author says that on assuming office he won 
the students' regard by expressing the hope "to 
become personally acquainted with them all a 
promise he made good." But the university had 
more than eight hundred students in Draper's 
first year, and not even the most zealous seeker 
of popularity could have accomplished the task 
indicated, in addition to engrossing administra- 
tive duties. Indeed, a faculty member of that 
time distinctly recalls Dr. Draper's expression 
of regret at his inability to acquaint himself with 
all the members of the corps of instruction 
about one-tenth the size of the student body. 
The book, pleasingly written, has also the more 
substantial merits of careful historical detail and 
a comprehensive grasp of its subject. It is a 
needed and useful contribution to our educational 
history. A more liberal inclusion of portraits 
among its well-chosen illustrations would have 
been welcome; such men as Peabody, Burrell, 
Forbes, Ricker, Shattuck, Snyder, and at least 
half a dozen more, it would have been pleasant 
to find looking out at us from the pages of this 
chronicle. 

WOMAN AS DECORATION. By Emily Bur- 
bank. Dodd, Mead ; $2.50. 
The tendency of the feminist movement has 
been, intentionally or unintentionally, to nullify 
woman's objective value, which, after all, in a 
world of dun-colored males, is not to be despised. 
It is very easy to understand why those with the 
cause of woman at heart should deprecate the 
commercialization of her beauty, but not so easy 
to comprehend why they should fail to see the 
advantage of utilizing that beauty to emphasize 
her individuality, should fail to realize that the 
objective value of a human being is an asset 
which, understood and rightly used, may become 
a spiritual force all the more potent for being 
purely objective. One can well conceive such 
books as "Woman as Decoration" being used 
as propaganda. It is frankly nothing more than 
an outline of the principles underlying the ef- 
fective costuming of woman, with illustrations 
drawn from the "modes" of all countries and 
all times. It expounds no philosophy of clothes 
it is technical rather than philosophic and it 
has no claim to being regarded as "literature"; 
and yet one feels that it should be recommended. 
It teaches the art of using an old weapon in a 
new cause.

NOTES osr NEW FICTIOX 



"The Human Tragedy" (Lane; $3), a trans- 
lation of one of the less-known works of Anatole 
France, will probably be welcomed chiefly for 
the excellent English into which it has been ren- 
dered by Alfred Allinson and for the interesting 
full-color illustrations by the Russian artist 
Michel Sevier, whose style suggests Bakst and 
the Moscow Art Theatre. But lovers of 
Anatole France will find in this comparatively 
neglected story, taken from "Le Puits de Sainte- 
Claire," an authentic utterance of the subtle 
Frenchman. Fra Giovanni, a naive follower of 
St. Francis, has embraced poverty and humility 
and despised his soul. But through the visits 
of the Prince of Men the curse of thought comes 
upon him and thereafter life gradually assumes 
a different aspect. He learns desire and specu- 
lation, the splendor and the cruelty of things 
created; he suffers but he also loves the adver- 
sary through whom suffering has come. Thus 
the undoing of Giovanni becomes a parable of 
the universal human tragedy of thought. In 
reading this tale one inevitably recalls the 
author's saying that Pity and Irony should be 
given to life for its witnesses and judges. 

"The Innocents," by Sinclair Lewis (Harper; 
$1.25), is nothing to lose one's critical temper 
over. It will be hailed in hundreds of American 
homes as a "sweet little story"; and perhaps it 
should be dismissed as such with a brief and 
friendly notice. But, somehow, all of it, even Mr. 
Lewis's disarming preface, which points out that 
the tale is one "for people who still read Dickens 
and clip out spring poetry and love old people 
and children," thus absolving the author of all 
pretensions to writing for a critical audience, is 
irritating. One doesn't want Mr. Lewis to write 
sweet little stories for sentimental ladies to laugh 
and weep over. One remembers "The Trail of 
the Hawk" and "The Job" neither of them a 
really big book, but both of them warmed by a 
rich, passionate interest in life and made digni- 
fied by a sincere searching after truth. They 
held out a promise. Some day, one felt, Mr. 
Lewis would outgrow his crudities and produce 
for us an American novel to which we might 
point with pride. Now comes "The Innocents" 
to break the promise. 

"The Innocents" carries with it the fear that 
Mr. Lewis has "arrived," but by that easiest 
way which entices so many of our young Ameri- 
can writers. A painted style, as our magazines 
bear witness, is popular with the crowd. Senti- 
mentality is easier than truth and pays better. 
It takes a chaste soul the soul of an artist 
to recognize and reject what cheapens and 



degrades ; and Mr. Lewis, one fears, does not even 
realize where the primrose path is leading him. 
If he did, he might not have had the courage to 
dedicate "The Innocents" to that "splendid 
assembly of young British writers" which 
includes Compton Mackenzie, Hugh Walpole, 
Oliver Onions, D. H. Lawrence, J. D. Beres- 
ford, Gilbert Cannan, Patrick MacGill, and, 
looming above them all, H. G. Wells. Any one 
of them has intellectual sophistication enough to 
reject the facile smartness of phrase, the essen- 
tial flimsiness, of Mr. Lewis's latest book, which 
presents a spectacle made all the sadder by the 
traces of a better self revealed in it. 

Among the well-remembered dislikes of one's 
childhood is the story of the little boy whose 
mother gave him loaf sugar with a few drops 
of rum on it to cure a cough. The little wretch 
soon learned to cough for the sugar, and, after 
that first step downward, descended to the gut- 
ter, where he died a drunkard's death amid his 
mother's vain self-accusations. One was familiar 
with tales of the same type invented, on emer- 
gency, by one's elders to illustrate what hap- 
pened to children who didn't "mind"; so that 
one could not be intrigued into accepting the 
loaf-sugar tragedy just because it was in a book 
with pictures. 

It is no longer considered good pedagogy to 
feed children on tracts, but tracts for adults, 
disguised under the more sophisticated title "fact 
stories," have been popularized long since by the 
"Saturday Evening Post." They produce the 
same irritation that the story of the little boy 
and the rum produced. One believes in neither 
the story nor the moral. 

Zona Gale's latest novel, "A Daughter of the 
Morning," presents the whole woman question 
under a thin sugar-coating of plot. The barren- 
ness of the country woman's life; the wrongs 
inflicted upon woman in industry and the neces- 
sity for organization as a means of righting them ; 
the relation of woman's work and marriage 
all these problems and more are faced and solved 
by a heroine with the suggestive name of Cosma, 
whose story, for fortuitousness, sentimentality, 
and slimness of characterization would put Hora- 
tio Alger to blush. As propaganda, the book 
is unconvincing; and it is impossible to avoid 
the issue, as the publisher does on the cover- 
jacket, by laying the emphasis on what the "right 
man" means in the life of a girl; for as a story, 
too, the book is unconvincing. "A Daughter 
of the Morning" must be set down as a "fact 
story," good enough for those that like their 
sociology, as well as their advertising, in tract 
form, but not to be considered from the view- 
point of fiction.

[November 22 



"The Unknown Isle," by Pierre de Coulevain 
(Dodd, Mead; $1.60), is a reprint but none the 
less welcome for that. The isle is England 
unknown, temperamentally speaking, to the 
French. With a loose plot for a skeleton, the 
author displays the English in all their activities, 
displays and contrasts them with her countrymen. 
She is delightfully human and enough of a cos- 
mopolitan to set down the idiosyncrasies of both 
races with insight and humor. Of course, the 
need for racial exposition is not so great since the 
mingling of the armies of both countries on the 
battle field. What renders the book worthy of 
perusal, then, is not the perspicacity of its author's 
views, but the disclosure of her unapproachable 
savoir-vivre. 

Algernon Blackwood delights in making the 
line between man and animal or between man 
and some mystic spirit so thin that sometimes it 
vanishes entirely. Thus in "Day and Night Sto- 
ries" (Dutton; $1.50) the first story shows us a 
man who is obsessed with the idea of flying, 
who is hawklike in look and action, who makes 
various attempts to fly and at last really seems 
to do so. For the unusual happenings in the 
stories of many writers there is a natural expla- 
nation, but for such events in Mr. Blackwood's 
tales there is ever only a supernatural, mystical 
reason. It is a note that few have the courage 
or the knowledge to strike, but it accounts in 
some measure for the attractiveness of his writing. 
Apart from the freshness of his theme, however, 
Mr. Blackwood is undeniably a master of style 
one not only rich and wonderful in itself, but 
also admirably adapted to his bizarre stories. 

"The Quest of Ledgar Dunstan," by Alfred 
Tresidder Sheppard (Appleton; $1.50), is not 
what one would anticipate after reading "The 
Rise of Ledgar Dunstan." The main theme of 
both books is Antichrist, who, it is affirmed, will 
be a slacker in the most vital duties of life. In 
the first book Dunstan 's interest in the subject 
is aroused and his progress in moral appreciations 
interestingly told. In the second book the author 
succeeds only in achieving prolixity. Here Dun- 
stan meets a character who introduces himself as 
Antichrist. Antichrist has, to use Mr. Shep- 
pard's figure of speech, used up all his "peau de 
chagrin" that is, lost his soul. According to 
the author, the soul is a finite, instead of an infi- 
nite quantity, and can really be lost bit by bit. 
Dunstan makes Antichrist finally recognize that 
there is an all-powerful God, but his religious 
theory is curiously garbled, for this recognition 
does not spell redemption as it does in so many 
modern creeds. Dunstan himself experiences an 
emotional conversion and marries the right 
woman; then, apparently, his soul is saved for 
good and all. 



CASUAL, COMMENT 



THE ENGLISH REVIEWS HAVE BEEN KEPT in 
a flutter of late by the approaching publication 
of an alleged new play by Ibsen. "Realities" 
was first described as a sort of continuation of 
"Ghosts," but it now appears that this was a 
mistake, and that the unknown play was really 
written earlier. Mr. Austin Fryers, whose 
identity seems to be rather cloudy, is in pos- 
session of the manuscript and has contemplated 
a stage production; he explains that the play 
was given by Ibsen to the late Mr. Brokstaed, 
who was an intimate friend of the Norwegian 
playwright and often visited him. On the other 
hand, Mr. Heinemann, Ibsen's "authorized" 
English publisher, recently gave to the "Times" 
a postcard from Sigurd Ibsen, denying that his 
father ever wrote such a play, together with 
copies of the correspondence in which he in- 
vited Mr. Fryers to deliver for inspection the 
original manuscript. He appears to have been 
quite willing to publish the play if its authentic- 
ity could be established. Such is the present 
status of a most interesting literary mystery, 
which should not long remain mysterious if 
critical pretensions are not simply an empty 
flourish. In the meantime, the case has other 
aspects that are enlivening. Some of the re- 
viewers do not conceal their animus against the 
"be whiskered little man" of the North, whose 
influence was "waning"; the impending publica- 
tion is frankly viewed as a threat rather than a 
promise. The mischief is the play may actually 
be genuine! Clearly the breed of emotional 
gentlemen who upheld the arms of Clement 
Scott when he was vindicating the claims of 
virtue and decorum in terms that were, by the 
very necessity of the case, themselves indecorous, 
is not yet extinct. 

* 

FOREIGN MAILING PRIVILEGES have been re- 
stored to the London "Nation," and the number 
now at hand only emphasizes the futility of the 
official ban. Nothing whatever has been gained 
by it. The "Nation" has made no concessions. 
It has neither altered its policy nor softened its 
speech. It takes the opportunity now offered to 
resume its advocacy abroad of a negotiated peace 
which will be genuinely constructive. That was 
really, in the opinion of the editors, the whole 
of its offending. There is nothing in the external 
situation to render such preaching less of an 
enormity now than it was six months ago; yet 
the military censor has yielded, apparently with- 
out seeking to explain his changed position. 
From the point of view of policy the restoration 
of the "Nation" was required. Its disinterested 
criticism of Junkerism at home, as well as in 
Germany, can only make friends abroad for the

British Empire. As a champion of fair play and 
an advocate of a rationally conceived interna- 
tional order, its influence is needed here. Its sup- 
pression was an act of superlative folly, especially 
since it happened to coincide roughly with the 
appearance of Lord Northcliffe among us. Was 
it really the official view that he would be a 
more acceptable representative of British opinion 
and purpose? 

WE HOPE THAT IN MAKING CHRISTMAS SE- 
LECTIONS for their friends book-buyers will not 
forget the thousands of young men in the 
trenches abroad and those who fill our canton- 
ments at home. Boredom, we are told, is the re- 
lentless foe of the soldier, and it is driving many 
who as civilians had no fondness for reading to 
form reading habits. Librarians throughout the 
country have done their best to meet the new 
demands upon their resources, but they still need 
help. Something of what has already been ac- 
complished at Camp Sherman is revealed in a 
long report prepared by Burton E. Stevenson, 
head of the library at Chillicothe, O., who issues 
an urgent appeal for books and magazines, assur- 
ing us that no gifts that can be sent to the men 
are more needed. It is hardly necessary to add 
that the greatest variety of tastes will have to be 
satisfied and that it would be a mistake to select 
fiction alone. 



IN HIS SUGGESTIVE PAPER "An Apology for 
Crudity," published in the last number of THE 
DIAL, Sherwood Anderson asks why it is that 
a man like Mr. Dreiser cannot write in the 
spirit of the early Americans. Why can't he see 
the fun in life? "In the work of Mark Twain 
there was something wholesome and sweet. Why 
cannot the modern man also be wholesome and 
sweet?" His answer is, of course, that the work 
of Mr. Dreiser is wholesome, because it is true 
to the life about him, and truth is always whole- 
some. But why the changed temper? What 
does it signify? Our humorists have been the 
most characteristic of our interpreters; they love 
cant no more than Mr. Dreiser; and they have 
been even more pungent in dealing with hypocrisy 
and smugness. Yet they are never thought of 
as unwholesome or "dangerous"; and they are 
quite the most popular of our writers. Why? 
Because almost without exception they have been 
popular-minded ; neither more nor less philosoph- 
ical than the average man. They have not chal- 
lenged existing ideals or standards but only the 
amusing discrepancy between theory and prac- 
tice, and they have to that extent actually bols- 
tered up the ideals. As Mr. Santayana puts it 
in "The Genteel Tradition in American Philos- 



ophy," our humorists have got their effects pre- 
cisely by accepting the genteel tradition with the 
head after its hold on the heart had been re- 
laxed. "So when Mark Twain says, 'I was 
born of poor but dishonest parents,' the humor 
depends on the parody of the genteel Anglo- 
Saxon convention that it is disreputable to be 
poor; but to hint at the hollowness of it would 
not be amusing if it did not remain at bottom 
one's habitual conviction." But with Mr. 
Dreiser that habitual conviction has been hope- 
lessly undermined, and the whole problem be- 
comes so complicated and disturbing as to call 
for something more challenging and subversive 
than humor. 



ALTOGETHER PLEASING TO THE EYE, though a 
little unwieldy to handle, is the second number 
of "Form," the new English quarterly, which 
has just reached our desk. A journal devoted 
to art as well as to literature, "Form" has to 
accommodate itself to the reproduction of wood- 
cuts and lithographs that will not stand reduc- 
tion; hence its formidable proportions. The 
verse in the present number is contributed by 
W. H. Davies, John Freeman, Francis Burrows, 
J. C. Squire, Gilbert Cannan, and T. Sturge 
Moore. Imaginative prose is represented by 
happy selections from L. Pearsall Smith's 
"Trivia," which can now be had in book form 
in this country. Among the artists who con- 
tribute drawings and woodcuts are Frank 
Brangwyn, A. O. Spare, and T. Sturge Moore. 



THE ENGLISH UNIVERSITIES, one hears, are 
preparing to join the French in making them- 
selves attractive to American students after the 
war. In a worthy effort to divert the stream 
that used to flow to the German universities, 
Oxford and Cambridge are making changes in 
the curricula. Oxford, indeed, has even gone 
so far as to consider bestowing the Ph.D. de- 
gree a concession to American prepossessions 
of arresting magnitude. In some ways, however, 
it is regrettable that anything should be done 
to sanction the superstitious veneration in which 
those magic letters are currently held. As long 
as they are thought of as the sine qua non of 
academic advancement, it is hard to see how we 
can escape from the ineptitude and the extrava- 
gant silliness of the average doctor's thesis in, 
say, English literature. Still, it is encouraging 
to remember that the English have always been 
among the keenest critics of such folly, and it is 
extremely unlikely that they will be inclined to 
insult their own intelligence by giving the doc- 
torate for studies in the use of the semicolon 
in Georgian poetry.

world's work. "Last year Sherwood Anderson's first 
novel. 'Windy McPherson's Son.' was pretty gen- 
erally hailed as pointing to a 'coming man' among 
the younger American writers. His second novel. 
'Marching Men.' has just appeared, and greatly 
strengthens that impression." Life.

The economic evolution of the last century pro- 
duced the law of employer's liability as a develop- 
ment of that of master and servant; but gradually 
it became apparent that injustice was being done 
to the laboring classes. Beginning in Germany, and 
now in most of the civilized nations, attempts have 
been made to remedy defects by enactments gen- 
erally known as workmen's compensation acts. 
The principles are not as yet definitely determined, 
nor is there general agreement as to form and 
method. With each advance we find corporations 
or combinations willing to assume for the em- 
ployer the liability involved, either as a profitable 
business or as a means of equalizing the obliga- 
tions of society. Mr. Ralph H. Blanch a rd covers 
the entire field in a very fair way, in "Liability 
and Compensation Insurance" (Appleton; $2.), 
though it is evident that he does so in the pro- 
fessor's study rather than from the ground of 
practical experience. The insurance feature is es- 
pecially well covered. 

"Rambles in Old College Towns," by Hilde- 
garde Hawthorne (Dodd, Mead; $2.50), gives 
an informal and gossipy account of what may be 
seen and heard in brief tourist trips to sixteen of 
the best-known American colleges. The restriction 
of age excludes from the scope of the book some of 
the most picturesque campuses in the country, but 
the choice made by the author can hardly be ob- 
jected to. Cornell is the most westerly of the 
institutions visited, as it is the youngest of those 
that admit men. No women's colleges are as 
yet quite venerable, but it seems natural enough 
that Vassar, Smith, and Wellesley should take 
their places with Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. 
The descriptions of buildings and of elms grow a 
trifle monotonous, if one reads the book in course, 
and will doubtless be the most enjoyable to the 
students and alumni of the institutions portrayed. 
There is more variety in the historical anecdotes 
of the different colleges, and in the glimpses of 
local college customs and traditions. Sixteen plates 
after drawings by John Albert Seaford add much 
to the value of the volume, which may be described 
as just the sort of thing one would like to give 
to some alumnus or appreciative undergraduate of 
one of the institutions described. 

"The Arctic Prairies," by Ernest Thompson Se- 
ton (Scribner; $1.75), is a new edition of this 
excellent work on northern travel. The record of 
a canoe journey in search of caribou that took him 
2000 miles through virgin territory and among 
the trading-posts adjacent to the Peace and 
Mackenzie Rivers, it is still as fresh in its viewpoint 
as when it was written some six or eight years 
ago. Valuable as an informal contribution to nat- 
ural history, geography, and ethnology, its read- 
ability lies chiefly in the author's tolerant and 
good-humored attitude toward his fellow-men. 

In "The Social Teachings of the Jewish 
Prophets" (Sherman, French) Mr. William Ben- 
nett Bizzell surveys in succession what he calls 
the "social program" of each of the Hebrew 
prophets from Amos to Jonah. Each programme

is set in its appropriate political and social back- 
ground. Prophetic emphasis was laid most largely, 
he thinks, on religion, but on religion in connection 
with the establishment of good order and harmony 
in human relations. The demonstration is made 
by a collation of source material and its general- 
ization into a "social program," in simple, clear 
language, but with a too pedagogical dryness of 
manner. 

Mr. Francis B. Reeves was the commissioner of 
the Philadelphia Relief Committee who supervised 
the delivery and distribution of the cargo of food- 
stuffs sent to Russia during the famine of 1891-92, 
and the main portion of his book, "Russia Then 
and Now" (Putnam; $1.50), is a naive account of 
this mission. Except for purely superficial descrip- 
tions of the conditions of the peasants during those 
hard times, this account is almost wholly con- 
cerned with official receptions, attentions from 
titled Russians, and honorary memberships in clubs 
and uplift societies. These revelations of the 
author's personality are supplemented by quotations 
from the commercial booklets of R. Martens & Co., 
the National City Bank, and the Guaranty Trust 
Co., from the "National Geographic Magazine," 
the "Continent," and the "Sunday School Times," 
which rather inadequately fulfil the promise of the 
"Now" in the book's title. Mr. Reeves has made 
a pleasant and appropriate memorial of an inci- 
dent in the friendly relations that have long existed 
between the United States and Russia, but he 
leaves unsatisfied those readers who expect any 
analysis or interpretation of Russia, or the Rus- 
sians, then or now. 

A cataclysm like the present cannot but turn the 
thoughts of serious persons upon those fundamental 
realities that remain unshaken even by a world- 
upheaval; and these basic truths are eloquently 
touched upon in Mr. Paul Revere Frothingham's 
brief chapters, the first of which gives its title to 
the book "A Confusion of Tongues" (Houghton 
Mifflin; $1.25). It was because the nations of the 
world did not speak the same language, in a spir- 
itual sense, that there came this clash of arms, the 
subsidence of which will leave a more adequate 
realization of the need henceforth of world-wide 
understanding and fellowship. A good essay on 
"The Conduct of Life," which achieves the unex- 
pected by omitting Matthew Arnold's familiar ut- 
terance and by not quoting one word from Emerson, 
follows the opening article, and then come helpful 
talks on Alain de Lille's famous motto, on "Making 
the Best of Things," "How to Choose," "Extra 
Pennies," "Unshaken Things," and other themes. 

The love affairs of poets have a special interest 
for Mr. Alfred Turner, and he takes pleasure in 
recalling the amorous adventures of Byron, Burns, 
and Shelley, the unhappy attachment of Keats to 
Fanny Brawne, and kindred episodes among men 
of letters, while he also contributes a number of 
short and scholarly essays on a wider variety of 
themes, well calculated to hold the attention of 
any fairly well-read person who once opens "On 
Falling in Love, and Other Matters" (Dutton; 
$1.50). The chapter-heading, "The Greatest 
Woman Letter Writer," prepares the reader, as

a matter of course, for a dissertation on Madame 
de Sevigne; but Mr. Turner's supreme mistress of 
the epistolary art turns out to be Lady Mary 
Wortley Montagu, nor are any apologies offered 
to the French woman, though a complimentary ref- 
erence to her in one of the other's letters is quoted. 
The assertion in regard to Byron's family affairs 
that "no such interest has been manifested in the 
domestic infelicities of any man save Nelson" leaves 
us wondering where Thomas and Jane Welsh 
Carlyle come in with respect to this prying curi- 
osity on the part of the great public Such chap- 
ters as "A Plea for the Minor Poet," "The Poetry 
of New Lands," and "The Importance of the 
Right Word" illustrate Mr. Turner's fondness for 
thought and expression that lie off the main high- 
ways of literature. 

Something more than family genealogy and fam- 
ily history has found its way into the spacious 
volume written by Mr. Arthur Robert Ingpen on 
"An Ancient Family" (Longmans, Green) his 
own family of Ingpen. In tracing the Saxon origin 
of the Ingpens he has been enticed into an inviting 
domain of history, that dealing with early social 
and economic conditions in England. He found 
himself inquiring, concerning his forefathers, "how 
they were housed, clothed and fed; what their daily 
occupations; what their amusements; what their 
vicissitudes in time of pestilence, civil war and dis- 
order; and what became of the younger members 
of the family at a time when the profits from land 
were practically the sole sources of wealth," and 
so on in matters of curious detail not usually found 
in books of this kind. The work was evidently 
entered upon as a pastime, and not merely in the 
spirit of the professional genealogist. Hence its 
more warmly human appeal than that of the usual 
book of its class, though the appended wills and 
deeds and pedigrees have enough of dryness to suit 
the most severely exacting. 

Genealogists have a feast spread for them by 
Mr. Hamon Le Strange in his substantial quarto 
devoted to "Le Strange Records" from 1100 to 
1310 A. D. (Longmans, Green; $7). It is "a 
chronicle of the early Le Stranges of Norfolk and 
the March of Wales," including also "the lines 
of Knockin and Blackmere continued to their ex- 
tinction." As sources of information the rolls and 
charters in the Public Record Office and the British 
Museum have been searched, and "considerable 
use has been made of the family muniments pre- 
served at Hunstanton Hall." Nothing has been 
admitted to the book without rigorous proof of 
its historic accuracy, and thus the mixture of fact 
and fable not uncommon in family histories has 
been, as far as possible, avoided. Facsimile pages 
from many ancient documents are interspersed, giv- 
ing plenty of occupation to those who like to de- 
cipher the crabbed handwriting of the period. A 
full index of persons, one of places, and one of 
subjects close the book. 

A fuller apprehension (one cannot call it compre- 
hension) of spirit through the study of its manifes- 
tations in a world that includes both matter and 
spirit, is the purpose of Dr. W. Tudor Jones's 



1917]

thoughtful book, "The Spiritual Ascent of Man" 
(Putnam; $1.50). "We must begin at the very 
bottom," he declares, "dealing with the solid earth 
and all its manifestations, and, step by step, pass 
upward, following all the demands of thought as 
well as the demands of our own nature." For 
"thus and thus only," he continues, "can we pass 
beyond the boundaries of sense to a transcendent 
world of thought and goodness and holiness." This 
might seem to be a bold attempt to bridge the 
impassable gap between matter and mind, but the 
whole argument, carefully followed, leaves no 
doubt of the author's recognition of the difference 
in kind between the two, however baffling he may 
find their close interaction. Leading writers are 
freely quoted, and thus is fulfilled the purpose of 
the book, which is, in addition to that already 
indicated, "to present some of the main problems 
of science, philosophy, and religion as these are 
dealt with by a number of the most prominent 
writers of our day." The Master of Balliol con- 
tributes a short commendatory foreword. 

"The Human Side of Trees" has been set forth 
with much literary art and no little imagination 
by Mr. Royal Dixon and Mr. Franklyn E. Fitch. 
We are asked to believe that "trees possess certain 
mental and moral characteristics and the attributes 
of reason, memory, hope, language, love, and all 
forms of righteous ambition." Further, "if man 
has a soul, so have trees," the authors dare to 
assert. To their sympathetic perception trees "are 
beings which in a minor degree have all human 
pleasures and understandings, and ... in the 
future life they will very likely be compensated 
for their struggles and difficulties here in this 
world." After this it will surprise no one to 
find the succeeding chapters dealing with "Trees 
That Build Cities," "Trees with a Personality," 
"Trees with a College Education," "Trees That 
Keep a Diary," "Trees That Travel," "Musical 
Trees," and even "Religious Trees." A final word 
on "Trees and Civilization" closes the book. It 
contains much curious information, scientific and 
historic, and some that is neither, in a strict sense, 
but is none the less readable. (Stokes; $1.60.)

ALAN SEEGER. 

(To the Editor of THB DIAL.) 
I was glad to read in THE DIAL of October 25 
Mr. Street's objection to Mr. Kinne's recent review 
of Alan Seeger. I was glad because the disagree- 
ment between Mr. Street and Mr. Kinne raises an 
issue of considerable literary interest and one 
which fails consistently to receive the attention it 
should. Literary legends develop with all the 
rapidity and subtlety of scandal, and to treat them 
as holy is to invite the risk of becoming the dupe 
of sentimentalism. It was Mr. Kinne's hardihood 
in looking a developing legend in the eye, which 
caused me to recognize in his review an unusual 



A Dividend in War 

Time for DIAL 

Subscribers 

When I purchased THE DIAL eighteen months 
ago, I believed there was in America a public 
which would support a progressive, independent 
journal of criticism. That assumption has been 
justified not only by the response of subscribers, 
but also by the splendid cooperation of the lead- 
ing thinkers and writers. 

The following letter from Professor John 
Dewey is but one of many inspired by the new 
editorial policy of THB DIAL: 

"Not only the Middle West but the 
country is to be congratulated on the 
development which is going on in THE 
DIAL. // is rapidly becoming a national 
influence, a journal to be reckoned with 
by those who think, especially because 
of its combination of honest informed 
book reviews with humane and pro- 
gressive social policies, and, not least, 
good 'writing, hard hitting, tolerant, 
straightforward writing proceeding 
from an imaginative vision" 

Now that THE DIAL is established editorially, 
the next step in its career is the securing of a 
wider reading public. 

It would be comparatively easy to secure 
increased circulation by means of advertising, 
but I prefer to spend that money in further 
improving THE DIAL. Consequently I am ask- 
ing the cooperation of our readers in doubling 
our circulation before January 1st. Attached to 
this letter is a scheme whereby each DIAL sub- 
scriber may benefit not only THE DIAL but him- 
self in this cooperation.

exhibition of literary integrity. God knows 'tis 
needed in these trying times. 

Mr. Street, however, finds that the reviewer 
"failed utterly to catch the real value of the pub- 
lication." He intimates, moreover, that Mr. 
Kinne misleads the readers of THE DIAL by taking 
unfair advantage of the reviewer's privilege of 
quotation. These are not light accusations. As 
one who takes THE DIAL seriously, I felt im- 
pelled to satisfy myself regarding the reliability of 
the reviewer in question. 

Mr. Kinnc's review emphasizes three points: (1) 
that the bulk of Seeger's letters and diary is com- 
monplace; (2) that Alan Seeger was narrow- 
minded in his attitude toward other points of view 
than his own; (3) that, in spite of all this, there 
were "purple patches" of wisdom in the book. 
Mr. Street's letter is not an examination of these 
points, but a declaration of his own convictions. 
With one exception he talks about matters the 
reviewer does not touch upon, and which in the 
light of the reviewer's criticism are irrelevant. The 
one exception is found in the third paragraph of 
the letter: "I do not agree with the reviewer," 
says Mr. Street, "that Alan Seeger meant that 
we are all 'cowards, hypocrites and fools' because 
we cannot fight and must do our bit in 'second- 
best things.'" He didn't mean it! Oh, yes, he 
meant it. He not only said it in so many words 
in a poem which he knew would be published, he 
reiterated it in his prose. As I read the letters, 
that is Alan Seeger. And I believe he would be 
proud to defend his position, were he alive. The 
intimation that Mr. Kinne has quoted unfairly 
which is Mr. Street's evidence for his contention 
is untrue to fact and can only find support in 
biased or careless interpretation. 

As I see it, the difference between Mr. Street 
and Mr. Kinne is ultimate. They might argue 
with one another till the cows come home but 
they'd go to bed without a change of sides. For 
the difference is the difference between a senti- 
mental and an intellectual type of mind. I can- 
not understand why the fact that Alan Seeger was 
kind to his mother should influence Mr. Kinne in 
attempting to arrive at a critical estimate of the 
poet's literary contribution or philosophical outlook. 
Neither do I understand why, now that the poet 
"has met the death of his dreams, now that he 
has disappeared at the pinnacle of his cherished 
career," the literary critic cannot believe and should 
not remember the words of Victor Chapman, 
quoted by Mr. Kinne, that Alan Seeger was "an 
appalling wreck before the war." Such trying to 
forget and refusing to believe are the very essence 
of sentimentalism. Referring to the review I find 
that Mr. Kinne deliberately refrains from putting 
a specific construction upon Victor Chapman's 
words, but this evident endeavor to be fair, as well 
as the genuine appreciations expressed in the re- 
view, Mr. Street overlooked in spite of rereadings.

Mrs. Alfred Morrison has instructed Sotheby, 
Wilkinson & Hodge of London to sell the world- 
renowned Morrison collection of autograph letters 
and documents. It contains a large number of 
items of unique historical interest, such as the 
four-page autograph letter written by Mary, 
Queen of Scots, to her brother, King Henry III, 
the night before her execution, the famous corre- 
spondence between Admiral Nelson and Lady Ham- 
ilton, and the Blessington papers. The sale will 
be divided into several parts, the first of which 
will take place on December 10 and the four fol- 
lowing days. 

The same firm will sell this winter a fine collec- 
tion of letters written by Dr. Samuel Johnson and 
Mrs. Thrale. It comprises the originals of up- 
wards of 200 of the letters published by Madame 
Piozzi (Mrs. Thrale) in her two volumes of 
"Letters to and from the late Samuel Johnson, 
LL.D, 1788," as well as some not published by 
her, including the famous letter written by Dr. 
Johnson to Mrs. Thrale after she had announced 
to him her approaching marriage to Piozzi, and her 
reply. The collection also includes the manuscript 
of Dr. Johnson's famous poem to Sir John Lade, 
"Long expected one and twenty." 

The history of the collection is interesting. The 
letters came into the possession of Piozzi's nephew, 
John Piozzi, whom Mrs. Thrale adopted, and who 
took her maiden name of Salusbury. She also 
gave him her Welsh family property, including the 
houses at Bachycraig and Brynhella in the vale of 
Clwy. The letters remained in the possession of 
the Salusbury family, who continued to occupy 
the Welsh property, and are now owned by one of 
the last descendants of the Salusbury name, who 
is a great-grand-daughter of Mrs. Piozzi's adopted

In a masterly and convincing manner, Dr. 
Cram develops his subject, not only as an 
organic scheme of building, but as a definite 
exponent of the religious, philosophical, social, 
political, and economic conditions that obtained 
in mediaevalism. 

The substance of this vital book formed Dr. 
Cram's Lowell Institute Lectures at Boston last 
winter. As the foremost American authority 
on Gothic Architecture, whose work in con- 
nection with the new St. Thomas Church in 
New York and the splendid buildings at West 
Point and Princeton is world famous, his latest 
and, in some respects, most important book 
commands immediate attention. 

All who think deeply of the present world 
crisis and of what is to come after will find 
illuminating guidance in Dr. Cram's scholarly 
and inspiring volume.

Many rarities were in the Americana sold by the 
I American Art Association, of New York, on No- 
j veinber 19 and 20. Among the items was the 
only known copy of "The Isle of Pines," by Henry 
Neville, printed by Samuel Green at Cambridge, 
Massachusetts, in 1668. This is an unrecorded 
issue of one of "the lost books" of the colonial 
press at Cambridge. It came from Bishop White 
Kennett's library, which was sold in London 
on July 30, 1917, and has his autograph on the 
title. "The American Physitian," by W. Hughes, 
London, 1672, is the rare first edition of this work. 
A portrait of George Washington, in the original 
wax, was undoubtedly done from life by Joseph 
Wright, portrait-painter, and from it he made the 
plaster cast which he sent to his mother, Patience 
Wright, as a model for her famous wax relief 
portrait of Washington. 

"The American Querist," by Myles Cooper, New 
York, printed by James Rivington, 1774, is the 
rare second issue of which no other copy is recorded 
as sold at auction in America. "A Declaration of 
the Demeanor and Cariage of Sir Walter Raleigh," 
London, 1618, is the rare first edition. "An 
Historical Account, of the Small Pox Inoculation 
in New England," by Zabdiel Boylston, Boston, 
1730, is exceedingly scarce. No copy is recorded 
as sold at auction in America. "The White Footed 
Deer and other Poems," by William Cullcn Bryant, 
New York, 1844, is the first edition of one of the 
rarest of his works. It is uncut and with the 
original wrappers. "Case of Great Britain and 
America," by Gervase P. Bushe, Boston, 1769, is 
also scarce, only two other copies having been sold 
at auction in America. William Smith's "Exam- 
ination of the Connecticut Claim to Lands in Penn- 
sylvania," Philadelphia, 1774, is a rare and im- 
portant historical item. "Green's Register for Con- 
necticut," New London, 1784, and 1785, are the 
rare first and second issues. 

A scarce autograph letter is that of Daniel 
Parke Custis, the first husband of Martha Wash- 
ington, dated May 5, 1755. "Sabbath Profanity," 
by Francis Worcester, Boston, 1760, is probably 
a unique piece of early American poetry. "Amer- 
ica," by William Livingston, New Haven, 1770, 
is very scarce, no copy being recorded as sold at 
auction in America. "A Philosophical Treatise of 
the Original and Production of Things Writ in 
America in a Time of Solitudes," by Richard 
Franck, London, 1687, is the scarce first edition. 
"Notes on the State of Virginia," by Thomas Jef- 
ferson, Paris, 1782, is the extremely rare original 
edition. "A Letter to a Friend," by John Kears- 
ley, Philadelphia, printed by B. Franklin and D. 
Hall, 1751, is of excessive rarity. Only one other 
copy is recorded, that in the possession of the 
Historical Society of Pennsylvania. "Statement of 
the Kennebeck Claims," Boston, 1786, is scarce. 
"A Report of the Causes," by James Hughes, 
Lexington, 1803, is the rarest of the Kentucky 
reports. "New Hampshire Committee of Safety," 
Exeter, 1779, is one of the rarest of American 
broadsides. "The Military Glory of Great 
Britain," Philadelphia, 1762, is a rare Princeton 
College pamphlet.

"A Concise View of the Controversy between 
the Proprietors of East and West Jersey," by 
Ebenezer Cowell, Philadelphia, 1783, is a scarce 
and important historical item. The "History of 
Peru," by Diego Fernandez, Seville, 1571, is the 
original and only edition of this rare book. An 
autograph letter of Henry R. Schoolcraft, the noted 
ethnologist, to Governor Lewis Cass, was accom- 
panied by a manuscript map in Schoolcraft's auto- 
graph, being a sketch of the seat of war between 
the Chippewas and the Sioux. "A Narrative of 
the Rise and Progress of the Difficulties, which 
issued in a Separation between the Minister and 
the People of Bennington," by David Avery, Ben- 
nington, 1783, is one of the scarcest Vermont 
items offered at auction in recent years. William 
Stith's "History of the First Discovery and Settle- 
ment of Virginia," Williamsburg, 1747, is the orig- 
inal edition of the first American-printed history 
of Virginia. "An Ode Sacred to the Memory 
of General Wolfe," London, 1759, is the rare 
first edition. It was the first copy to be offered 
at public auction either in America or Great 
Britain. 

Autographs, manuscripts, broadsides, and pam- 
phlets left by Dr. John W. Francis, author of "Old 
New York" and other works, were sold by Scott & 
O'Shaughnessy, of New York, on November 21. 
On November 22 they will sell first editions of 
modern authors. On November 14 and 15 Charles 
F. Libbie, of Boston, sold the second part of the 
library of Frank B. Sanborn, of Concord, Massa- 
chusetts. 

On December 3 and 4 the American Art Asso- 
ciation will sell the library of the late James 
Buchanan ("Diamond Jim") Brady. It includes 
the original agreement signed by Charles Dickens 
and W. H. Willis relating to the publication of 
"All the Year Round," and the knife, fork, and 
spoon carried by Napoleon I throughout all his 
campaigns. In the second week of December will 
be sold Americana from the libraries of Edmond 
B. Sterling, of Trenton, New Jersey, and Miss 
Gertrude Rogers, of South Manchester, Connect- 
icut, and the historical library of William Bunker, 
of Ridgefield, Connecticut. 

Gabriel Wells, of New York, has come into 
possession of the historic copy of Thomas Carlyle's 
"The French Revolution" that Charles Dickens 
used in the writing of "The Tale of Two Cities." 
It was presented in 1858 by Dickens to Edmund 
Yates. It was Yates who caused the estrangement 
between Dickens and Thackeray. In his preface to 
"The Tale of Two Cities," Dickens says: 

Whenever reference (however slight) is made here 
to the condition of the French people before or during 
the revolution, it is truly made on the faith of trust- 
worthy witnesses. It has been one of my hopes to 
add something to the popular and picturesque means 
of understanding that terrible time, though no one 
can hope to add anything to the philosophy of Mr. 
Carlyle's wonderful work. 

The Rosenbach Company, of Philadelphia, has 
sold Benjamin Franklin's copy of his famous epi- 
taph for $5500. There is another copy in Frank- 
lin's autograph in the Library of Congress.

The Sources of the 
Power of Music 

By ELLA WHITE CUSTER 

A series of six chapters analyzing Music to 
its basic principles and seeking the sources of 
its power over the mind of Man. It is based 
upon the experience of a lifetime, with unusual 
opportunities for observation, and is prompted 
by a deep appreciation of the beauty of Music 
and of its influence upon Man. This book 
makes its appeal to thoughtful students and to 
those music-lovers who have had no technical 
training, but who desire to know something 
of the reasons why Music has such a wide- 
spread and varied interest. It is clearly and 
concisely written, and there is "not one super- 
fluous sentence." 

This Work is issued as follows: 
DE LUXE EDITION 

400 copies, post quarto (8 x 10%) printed on

The best way to give an idea of McLandburgh 
Wilson's poems of America at war (Macmillan's) 
is to present one of them for inspection and here 
it is: 

MOVING TIME 

Your Uncle Sam is busy now, for moving time has 

come, 
He packs his good old uniform, his sabre and his 

drum; 
He packs the family portraits that have hung upon 

the wall, 
George Washington and Lincoln, and his heroes, one 

and all. 

Quite certain rays of Liberty are needed every- 
where, 

He also packs his precious lamp with most uncom- 
mon care, 

And last he takes the family bird, the pet with eagle 
scream, 

And piles them all into the van and wallops up 
the team! 

Where is his new abiding place? where will his 

home be made? 
He goes into the biggest house in which he ever 

stayed, 
For when beside his Allies' flags his standard is 

unfurled, 
He moves from out a continent and moves into a 

world. 

The prize of $500 offered by the Southern So- 
ciety of New York for the best literary work 
published in 1916 by a southern writer has been 
awarded to Olive Tilford Dargan for her volume 
of sonnets "The Cycle's Rim." The judges in 
the contest, which was open to natives of sixteen 
states and to works of either prose or poetry, were 
Talcott Williams, dean of the School of Journal- 
ism at Columbia; Virginia Gildersleeve, dean of 
Barnard College; and John H. Finley, state com- 
missioner of education in New York. Mrs. Dar- 
gan was born in Grayson County, Kentucky, and 
went to the public schools in which her father and 
mother were continuously teachers, until she was 
ten years old. Then with her parents she went 
to the town of Doniphan, Missouri, where she 
stayed for four years. At the age of fourteen she 
herself became a teacher in the backwoods of Ar- 
kansas, a region of hills and streams. Through 
these years she had always hoped for a college 
education, but when she became eighteen her 
mother died; her father, now an invalid, returned 
to Kentucky, and her chance seemed lost. She 
was determined, however, and finally obtained a 
Peabody scholarship, which took her to the Uni- 
versity of Nashville, Tennessee. After further 
teaching and a year at Radcliffc in 1894, study- 
ing English and philosophy, she worked as a 
stenographer in Boston and then married a young 
South Carolinian, a Harvard student whom she 
had met while at Radcliffe. She has since lived 
in Boston. Her work includes three volumes of 
poetical dramas: "The Mortal Gods and Other 
Dramas," "Lords and Lovers and Other Dramas," 
and "Semiramis and Other Dramas"; "The Path 
Flower and Other Verses"; and the cycle of son- 
nets that won her the prize.

The Editor 

is a weekly magazine for writers 

It is twenty-two years old. Those who conduct it 
like to think of it as a weekly visitor to ambitious 
writers, as a visitor who must not be pretentious, 
not dull, but friendly and helpful. Recognizing that 
writing may be an art, or a trade, or a profession 
what the writer himself makes it THE EDITOR 
tries to tell writers, so far as such things may be 
taught, how to write stories, articles, verses and 
plays, etc. One thing it does, in a way that never 
has been equalled, is to bring to the attention of 
writers news of all the opportunities to sell their 
work. News of current prize competitions is a 
weekly feature. Editorials on copyright and authors' 
literary property rights are frequent. 

P. C. Macfarlane says that THE EDITOR'S lead- 
ing articles, which usually are written by Charles 
Leonard Moore, are the best essays on writing being 
published today. 

THE EDITOR has a department devoted to let- 
ters in which successful contemporary writers tell 
of the genesis, development and writing of certain 
of their published stories. 

A yearly subscription (52 weekly numbers) costs 
$3.00. A four months' trial subscription costs $1.00. 
Single copies are 10 cts. each.

PLEASES YOU, SEND FOR A FREE SPECIMEN COPY OF 

The Unpopular Review 

In the brief period of its existence [it] has taken rank as the leading publication of 
criticism and brilliant comment on current affairs on either side of the Atlantic. From the 
Editor of the Providence Journal. 

We may say for the benefit of our readers outside of New England and New York that there the literary 
judgments of The Providence Journal command as much respect as those of the leading metropolitan dailies. 

To carry a copy ... is almost equivalent to wearing a badge of intelligence. 
From a circular issued from the retail department of the Messrs. Putnam's bookstore. 

The freshness of its point of view is invigorating. The crying need of the weary old 
world is to get away from conventional viewpoints, conventional morality and conventional 
taste. 

[We stand up for most of the "conventional morality and conventional taste." But many a "point of view" 
from which they have hitherto been mapped seems to us no longer tenable, and we often try to base our surveys 
upon new ones. Editor.} 

I have read it through from cover to cover since the issuance of the first number 
. . . easily the ablest review of a general nature we have in this country. From a 
Judge of a State Supreme Court. 

Far and away the most stimulating appeal to the intellectuals that has yet been made 
by our periodical literature. I can imagine but one possible hindrance to your abundant 
success your falling into the snare that has been the ruin of all previous claims upon the 
illuminati, viz.: the notion that only agnostics are intellectual. From a Clergyman. 

[No danger! The number of clergy among our contributors and subscribers forefends that, let alone our 
own fervent believe in the essentials of religion. Editor. 1 

The most virile and interesting magazine that I have ever seen. 

It had the look of a good half hour morsel before bed-time and it postponed bed- 
time by just over three hours. 

It is pleasing indeed to find ... so apparent a desire to declare the truth and 
of necessity be named "unpopular." 

The most delightful magazine I have yet seen . . . something else must go: for 
I must have The Unpopular. 

The copy that I received had the most intelligent treatment of the suffrage question I 
have ever seen ... I would like all my fool sisters to be so enlightened. 

A breath from the heights of Parnassus.

'Your Cham at home and the cheeriest of 
Chums for every man in Army and Navy. y 



Clean literature and clean womanhood are the keystones of civilization 
and MY UNKNOWN CHUM is "the cleanest and best 



all-around book in the English Language." 

"Life is too short for reading inferior books." Bryce 

MY UNKNOWN CHUM 

("AGUECHEEK") 

Foreword by HENRY GARR1TY 

"An Ideal Chum." You will read it often and like it better the oftener you read it once 
read it will be your chum, as it is now the chum of thousands. You will see France, Belgium, 
England, Italy and America men and women in a new light that will make it the Chum of 
your traveling bag or kit and an inspiration for letters to or from home or the trenches. 

The story of the beautiful English girl and wife who gave her life in 

Belgium to the reclaiming of the degraded of her own sex will 

remind many a youth, man, and Soldier of what he 

owes to womanhood in these truly inferno times. 

It fulfills to the letter Lord Rosebery's definition of the three-fold function of a book 
"TO FURNISH INFORMATION, LITERATURE, RECREATION." 

What Critical Booklovers Say: 

SIR CHARLES FITZPATRICK, Chief Justice of Canada: 

'"My Unknown Chum' is a wonderful book 
I buy it to give to those I love and to friends 



PHILIP GIBBS, most brilliant of the English war 
correspondents : 
" 'My Unknown Chum' is delightful." 

COL. F. A. HEYGATE LAMBERT, Cavalry Club, 
London : 
" 'My Unknown Chum' delighted me." 

GOVERNOR DAVID I. WALSH, of Massachusetts: 
" 'My Unknown Chum' I cannot too strongly ex- 
press the pleasure and companionship I found in 
this excellent book. It is all that is claimed for it 
even more. It is not only a companion, but a friend." 

J. A. JUDD, New York: 

' "I love books. I love my library, in which are 
more than three hundred of the world's best works. 
If driven by adversity to a hall bedroom I could 
select five books that would supply me with delight- 
ful reading matter for the remainder of my days 
the first selection would be 'My Unknown Chum.' " 



I can repeat some of the pages almost by heart, 
ivho can appreciate a good book." 

THE NEW YORK SUN: 

"They don't write such English nowadays. The 
book is charming." 
CARDINAL GASQUET, the world's foremost scholar: 

"I have read 'My Unknown Chum' with the great- 
est possible pleasure." 

ALICE M. BRADLEY, author of the Belasco pro- 
duction "The Governor's Lady" : 

"The title 'My Unknown Chum' most aptly describes 
the book. It is a chum, a confidant, with old-time 
manners and all-time observation and philosophy. 
He takes you -with him and delights you. What 
delicious humor !" 
THE BAKER & TAYLOR COMPANY the largest 

wholesale booksellers: 

" 'My Unknown Chum' is a wonderful book 
appeals to the cultivated classes has a remarkable 
sale. We sell more copies than we do of many 'best 
selling" novels." 



Whether young or old, you will find "My Unknown Chum" the best of comrades all through 
life. He is a delightful Chum who will introduce you to about all that is worth while. He will 
tell you how to invest suffering with charm, how to manage should you, too, ever be "Hard Up in 
Paris" or elsewhere. His views of Cant of Life are worth in lasting results a typhoon of 
spoutings from Serio-comic Revivalists. 

Preachy? Not a bit of it. He will go with you to the theatre take you "Behind the Scenes" 
if you like, tell you about the art, the soul of the playhouse, with never a word or thought of the 
sensualistic rubbish that features only the flesh-mummer, her toothbrush brilliancy and the stage 
door that leads to so many family scandals, domestic wreckage, and divorce.

Books Your Children Will Delight in, and Books

The World's Wonder Stories 

By ADAM GOWANS WHYTE 

Author of "A Comody of Ambition*." "Yellowsands," etc. 

12. 38 Plates, many Text Illustrations. $1.75. 

A really novel book for children. The subject is not one little corner of Nature pre- 
sented like a piece of seaweed in a pretty frame or like an animal in a cage. It is Nature 
itself. The wheels of life are shown in movement, weaving suns and planets out of star- 
mist, shaping living things ever more wonderful until man himself appears. 

The Cambridge Book of Poetry for Children 

Edited by KENNETH GRAHAME 

Crown 8. Picture End Papers. $1.50. 

No better introduction to good poetry could be offered children than this collection, 
edited by the author of Dream Days and The Wind in the Willows. It maintains a position 
as first among anthologies for Young People. 

If I Could Fly 

By ROSE STRONG HUBBELL 

8. Five Illustrations in Full Color by Harold Gaze. $2.00. 

A book written in vers libre and addressed to children is a novelty. Mrs. Hubbell, 
whose Quacky Doodles' and Danny Daddies' Book is a juvenile classic, has employed free 
verse to express what a child would do, if he could fly, if he could climb like a squirrel, 
if he could buzz like a bumble-bee, if he could make a silky cord like a spider, if he 
could be the moon, or the many other things which he would like to be. In harmony with 
the poems are the delicately wrought and suggestive pictures by the artist, Harold Gaze, 
who contributes five full-page illustrations in color. 

Chocolate Cake and Black Sand and TWO other Plays 

By SAMUEL MILBANK CAULDWELL 

8. 16 Illustrations by Anna Richards Brewster. $1.50. 

These plays have been tried out on the stage and are well adapted for presentation by 
children. Two of them, Chocolate Cake and Black Sand and The Undoing of Giant Hot- 
stoff, are dream plays, and among the characters that appear to the sleeping heroine are 
witches and fairies, giants, ugly frogs, Jack Frost, and many other fantastic beings dear to 
the imagination of childhood. 

East o' the Sun and West o' the Moon 

By SIR GEORGE DASENT, D.C.L. 

Crown 8. 8 Full-page Illustrations. $1.25.

FOUR NOTABLE NOVELS 

a The White Ladies of Worcester 

By the Author off "THE ROSARY" 

"Told with the purity of style of which Mrs. Barclay is master, and a fidelity to the finest 
emotions which is remarkable. Seldom do we find such characters in fiction, and few are 
the writers that can portray them. 

"It is a splendid work, full of dramatic power and true to nature, yet reverent with things 
that are sacred, and altogether one of the finest books that has seen the light for many a 
day." San Francisco Call. 

b Unconquered 

By the Author off "CAPTAIN DESMON, DV. C." 

"Maud Diver has departed in this novel from the Indian background against which her ear- 
lier work is set, but she has by no means forsaken her powerfully dramatic method of deal- 
ing with an emotional theme." N. Y. Times. 

"There is a new depth, a new power in Mrs. Diver's latest story. . . . There is more 
spontaneity in it ; a surer realization of the facts of life ; a truer sense of human values, and 
her increased simplicity of phrasing adds force to her tale." Melbourne Australasian. 

c The Heart of Her Highness 

By the Author of "EVERYBODY'S LONESOME" 

"A finely woven romance of the old days of chivalry and brutality; a diverting and per- 
suasively accurate picture of old Flanders, of Ghent and Bruges and Louvain; a story of 
Mary of Burgundy, unhappy daughter of Charles the Bold, of her troubles, and final happy 
marriage; a story brightly gemmed with descriptive excellence by Clara E. Laughlin. 
"Not for years has so delightful a tale of olden times appeared, far more meritorious than 
anything Stanley Weyman ever did." Cleveland Plain Dealer. 

d The Safety Curtain 

By the Author off "THE WAY OF AN EAGLE" 

"In extraordinary power Ethel M. Dell's novels, as well as her short stories, challenge com- 
parison with any writings of our time. Here it is splendidly apparent, combined with mar- 
vellously tender witchery and gentle charm quite irresistible. The intensest primal pas- 
sions rage through these tales, but never get beyond the equal sway of sweet womanliness 
and loyal manhood. Tales which nobody with heart and red blood can read without a 
quickening of the pulse, or can lay down without a wish to take them up and read them 
again." N. Y. Tribune.

The Unpopular Review 

In the brief period of its existence [it] has taken rank as the leading publication of 
criticism and brilliant comment on current affairs on either side of the Atlantic. From the 
Editor of the Providence Journal. 

We nay ay for the benefit of our readers outside of New England and New York that there the literary 
judgment* of Tk* Providence Journal command a* much respect as those of the leading metropolitan dailie*. 

To carry a copy ... is almost equivalent to wearing a badge of intelligence. 
From a circular issued from the retail department of the Messrs. Putnam's bookstore. 

The freshness of its point of view is invigorating. The crying need of the weary old 
world is to get away from conventional viewpoints, conventional morality and conventional 
taste. 

[We stand up for most of the "conventional morality and conventional taste." But many a "point of view" 
from which they have hitherto been mapped seems to us no longer tenable, and we often try to base our surveys 
upon new ones. Editor.] 

I have read it through from cover to cover since the issuance of the first number 
. . easily the ablest review of a general nature we have in this country. From a 
Judge of a State Supreme Court. 

Far and away the most stimulating appeal to the intellectuals that has yet been made 
by our periodical literature. I can imagine but one possible hindrance to your abundant 
success your falling into the snare that has been the ruin of all previous claims upon the 
illuminati. viz. : the notion that only agnostics are intellectual. From a Clergyman. 

[No dancer I The number of clergy among our contributors and subscribers forefends that, let alone our 
own fervent believe in the essentials of religion. Editor.} 

The most virile and interesting magazine that I have ever seen. 

It had the look of a good half hour morsel before bed-time and it postponed bed- 
time by just over three hours. 

It is pleasing indeed to find ... so apparent a desire to declare the truth and 
of necessity be named "unpopular." 

The most delightful magazine I have yet seen . . . something else must go: for 
I must have The Unpopular. 

The copy that I received had the most intelligent treatment of the suffrage question I 
have ever seen ... I would like all my fool sisters to be so enlightened.

cism, description, obse_rvation, all the varied products and by-prod- 
ucts of a_ nature so richly brave and tender and glowing, are dis- 
covered in these delightful letters. The enshrining volumes are 
volumes to read slowly, to savor luxuriously, to think and dream 
over. Mark Twain's collected letters spell Twain to the life."

Poetry of Stefan George 



Although the doctrine of art for art's 
sake is commonly supposed to be peculiarly 
French in its origin and in its practical 
manifestations, it has received a surpris- 
ing amount of theoretical support from 
the German philosophers, at least one of 
whom, Schelling, was largely instrumental 
in spreading it abroad. But there has 
always been until recently a certain hesi- 
tation on the part of German writers to 
show themselves whole-souled votaries of 
the idea, as if its reputed frivolity were 
repugnant to the high seriousness of the 
Teutonic mind with its strong didactic ten- 
dencies. It has remained for the present 
generation in Germany to produce a group 
of writers who for drastic theory and con- 
sistency of practice may be fitly compared 
with Theophile Gautier or Oscar Wilde. 
When in the early nineties a coterie of 
young poets began circulating privately 
their "Blatter fur die Kunst," they were 
at first ignored as sterile dilettantes, and 
later, when their very persistency chal- 
lenged attention, decried as charlatans and 
decadents. Gradually, however, the work 
of Stefan George has won its way into 
critical esteem, since he first consented in 
1899 to address a wider public. It is true 
that his appeal has been limited, for he 
has deliberately restricted his audience by 
all manner of devices, even seeking to 
frighten off the casual or careless reader 
by the omission of capital letters and the 
arbitrary misuse of punctuation. This 
may seem to some like an intolerable pose, 
adopted pour epater le bourgeois, but if 
consistency is any test of sincerity, then 
George is indubitably sincere. In his 
desire to protest against the commerciali- 
zation and vulgarization of literature, he 
has never made the slightest concession to 
the curiosity or taste of a public whose 
suffrage he does not solicit. Yet fame of 
an attenuated sort has come to him in 
Germany. Abroad one seeks almost in 
vain for any recognition of him, though a 
recent voice (Ludwig Lewisohn in "The 



Spirit of Modern German Literature") 
has indeed proclaimed him to be at present 
"the first lyrical poet in Europe." The 
constant coupling of his name with that 
of Hofmannsthal has perhaps been un- 
fortunate. The Catholic Rhinelander and 
the Viennese Jew hold many a critical 
theory in common, but while the latter has 
become little more than a talented echo, 
George alone of all his group has shown 
genuine creative power and capacity for 
development. His output is not large. 
The fruit of twenty-five years of single- 
minded devotion to his art consists of six 
rather slender volumes, and it is significant 
that of these the last three contain his 
best work. 

The starting-point of these young 
innovators, who may be loosely called 
symbolists, was relentless opposition to 
naturalism. As a counterblast to the 
slogan of "truth in art," Hofmannsthal 
asserted truculently: "Gedichte sind ge- 
wichtlose Gewebe aus Worten." George, 
with somewhat less the air of paradox, 
has proclaimed his ideal to be "eine Kunst 
frei von jedem Dienst, eine Kunst aus der 
Anschauungsfreude, aus Rausch und Klang 
und Sonne." A poem, in his opinion, 
should evoke and suggest, should hint a 
situation or delicately convey a mood, but 
should shun facts and logic and lessons 
on pain of foregoing its very nature. 
Above all he has aimed steadily at the 
creation of a new poetic style whose key- 
note is to be distinction. His characteristic 
mood is Olympian. He wants to be aus- 
tere and aloof, draping himself in his 
dignity as if he were a high priest. He 
refuses to sentimentalize, to coruscate, to 
write "with a punch," or to make any 
other sort of meretricious appeal. Un- 
fortunately his inability to unbend or to 
take himself and his poetic mission lightly 
betrays a lack of humor which the reader 
may find grievous to bear. 

It is instructive to study George's be- 
ginnings in the light of his subsequent 



568 



THE DIAL 



[December 6 



accomplishments. He has collected the 
early poems which he deems worthy of 
preservation in a volume called "Die 
Fibel." These verses are competent but 
relatively undistinguished. The tone is 
adolescently melancholy; love and death 
are the favorite themes, handled some- 
what in the traditional romantic fashion. 
Their most interesting feature is an occa- 
sional touch of decadence, which was to 
appear as sensational anti-moralism in the 
sequence of poems entitled "Algabal." 
The hero of the latter is the notorious 
Roman emperor, Heliogabalus, whose ex- 
ploits Gibbon has recorded with such 
unsparing detail. The lines which George 
puts into the mouth of this imperial 
aesthete and pervert had a certain applica- 
tion to himself at that time: 

Mein Garten bedarf nicht Luft und nicht Warme, 
Der Garten, den ich mir selber gebaut, 
Und seiner Vogel leblose Schwarme 
Haben noch nie einen Fruhling geschaut. 

In this connection it is significant of his 
literary affinities at that time, that he 
chose to translate Rossetti, Swinburne, 
Baudelaire, Verlaine, and Mallarme. For- 
tunately this taint of unwholesomeness did 
not endure. Since "Algabal" he has pub- 
lished nothing that could incur the re- 
proach of perversity, and little that is 
even delicately depraved; and when he 
resumed his work of translating a few 
years ago, it was put into German portions 
of the "Divine Comedy." 

George's poems are at the opposite pole 
from the simplicity, directness, and clear- 
cut situations of the folk song. His love 
lyrics deal not so much with individual 
episodes as with typical stages of experi- 
ence. It has even been surmised that 
friendship has played a greater part in his 
life than love; but for this assumption 
there is no real warrant. What he seeks 
to do is not to transmit a feeling at white 
heat or to reproduce a situation still 
tremulous with life, but to pass his emo- 
tions through the alembic of reflection in 
order that the expression may be 
artistically purified. ' Fiihlend iiber dem 
Gefiihle zu stehen" is the way one of his 
critics has described his attitude; and 
George himself has asserted his ideal to 
be "eine Kunst iiber dem Leben, nachdem 
sie das Leben durchdrungen." To many 
readers his process of artistic clarification 



seems devitalizing. His poems appear 
cold, detached, impersonal. This objective 
mode of procedure has been made familiar 
by the Parnassian poets in France, but it 
falls distinctly out of the German tradition. 
Platen almost alone among German poets 
has been similarly reserved and restrained. 
Goethe, for all his aloofness, did at least 
lay bare his breast, and Heine, with 
his reiterated "lay of a broken heart," 
introduced into lyric poetry the note of 
aggressive self-revelation. But innate 
Keuschheit der Seele prevents George and 
his fellows from indulging in any such 
expansiveness : 

Wir werden nicht mehr starr und bleich 
Den fruheren Liebeshelden gleich, 
An Triibsal waren wir zu reich, 
Wir zucken leis und dulden weich. 

Sie hiessen tapfer, hiessen frei, 
Trotz ihrer Lippen manchem Schrei ; 
Wir litten lang und vielerlei, 
Doch schweigen miissen wir dabei. 

It is not surprising, therefore, that the 
public has been puzzled and frequently 
alienated, the more so since George's con- 
densation of style and his studied avoid- 
ance of trite phrases tend to considerable 
obscurity. Still it would be a capital mis- 
take to suppose that behind the chiseled 
perfection of these verses there is no 
significant human experience. Occasionally 
a situation of tragic intensity is conveyed 
to the reader by subtle suggestion. It 
becomes almost an exercise in intuition to 
attempt to divine the circumstances which 
have given rise to the poem and to gauge 
the poignancy of the author's feeling. 
George's conception of love is neither 
wholly sacred nor wholly profane. It 
alternates curiously between the heathen 
Eros and the Christian Caritas in a way 
which is characteristic of this incomplete 
pagan with his Catholic predilections. 
Perhaps the poet is aware that all his 
earthly amatory experiences are but fleet- 
ing symbols of an unrealizable love, a quest 
for what is forever beyond reach : 
Dcnn meine Liebe schlaft im Land der Strahlen. 
The case of his nature poems is simpler. 
There are no wild-woodland notes in his 
music. He sings by preference of tidy 
parks with neat paths, trimmed trees and 
benches beneath them, ponds with swans 
floating gracefully on their surfaces, 
glimpses of statuary in the boscage and

of a villa in the background decorative 
effects which one finds in certain of Bock- 
lin's pictures. In the volume "Das Jahr 
der Seele" a group of symmetrically 
arranged poems on summer, autumn, and 
winter contains some of his most typical 
work of this sort. The absence of spring 
is not accidental : there is little of the ver- 
nal impulse, the hope of quickening life, 
or the joy of youth, in this ripe and worldly 
wise poet. The following poem, much 
praised by his friend Hofmannsthal, brings 
out the unsuspected beauties of a late 
autumn scene: 

Komm in den totgesagten Park und schau: 
Der Schimmer ferner, lachelnder Gestade, 
Der reinen Wolken unverhofftes Blau 
Erhellt die Weiher und die bunten Pfade. 

Dort nimm das tiefe Gelb, das weiche Grau, 
Von Birken und von Buchs; der Wind ist lau; 
Die spaten Rosen welkten noch nicht ganz; 
Erlese, kiisse sie, und flicht den Kranz. 

Vergiss auch diese letzten Astern nicht, 
Den Purpur um die Ranken wilder Reben, 
Und auch was iibrig blieb von griinem Leben, 
Verwinde leicht im herbstlichen Gesicht. 

The unwonted simplicity and clearness 
of these lines are doubtless due to the fact 
that they are merely descriptive. In many 
other poems the sensuous impressions are 
secondary to the mood which they evoke, 
or rather it is the unity of man with the 
landscape which is brought out : 

Wir fiihlen dankbar wie zu leisem Brausen 
Von Wipfeln Strahlenspuren auf uns tropfen, 
Und blicken nur und horchen wenn in Pausen 
Die reifen Fruchte auf den Boden klopfen. 

There are occasional indications of an 
exotic longing, especially for the South, 
although George does not exhibit to the 
full that Italomania which has character- 
ized so many German writers since the 
days of Winckelmann. From a southern 
shore he writes : 

In dieser Luft von Weihrauch und von Rosen, 
Wo selbst der strenge Fiirst des Endes leicht, 
Als sei er nur der Spender von Almosen, 
Mit einem Lacheln durch die Lande schleicht. 

George's religiosity finds too constant 
expression in his works to be lightly dis- 
missed as the pantheistic prattle of the 
average minor poet. It is manifestly a 
vital part of his inner life, however diffi- 
cult it may be to find a formula for it. As 
a Rhinelander he is an heir of the oldest 
civilization in Germany with a deep back- 
ground of cultural tradition which would 



be rare in the more flatulent Prussia. As 
a Catholic he is mellow and wise with the 
garnered experience of Mother Church. 
From certain poems in "Der Teppich des 
Lebens" one would think of him as sitting 
in his palace of art "holding no form of 
creed, but contemplating all." Certain it 
is that his faith is not of the modern 
progressive sort; yet it is by no means 
narrowly dogmatic. It is tolerant enough 
to include Pan and an occasional hint of 
Priapus, but it admits of no compromise 
with the gods of modern materialism. He 
has a proud consciousness of his spiritual 
vocation : 

Ich bin ein Funke nur vom heiligen Feuer, 
Ich bin ein Drohnen nur der heiligen Stimme. 

In one of his noblest poems, "Litanei," 
he has given a moving expression of his 
soul's search after God. The evident 
suggestions of Catholic ceremonial in 
these verses are echoed elsewhere, as in his 
description of the elevation of the host: 
So sinken wir als Glaubige zu Grunde, 
Verschmolzen mit der tausendkopfigen Menge, 
Die schon wird wenn das Wunder sie ergreift. 

More appealing to the generality of his 
readers is the expression of religious 
aspiration divorced from all confessional 
implications in the only lines from his 
poems which have become in any sense a 
familiar quotation: 

Nicht vor der eisigen Firnen 
Drohendem Ratsel erschrick, 
Und zu den ernsten Gestirnen 
Hebe den suchenden Blick! 

In his so-called Zeitgedichte George 
shows himself an uncompromising oppon- 
ent of the spirit of the present age with its 
materialistic greed, its craze for enjoy- 
ment, and its mental and moral distrac- 
tion. He has apparently no feeling for 
such virtues as the times may possess 
for example, the sharpening of the social 
conscience or our keener sense of spiritual 
genuineness. His little poem "Hafenstadt 
und Mutterstadt" is an apologue to show 
the futility of what men are pleased to 
call progress. The Mutterstadt, a spot of 
quiet beauty nestling in the hills, falls into 
decay, while the Hafenstadt, filled with 
the blatant ugliness of modern commer- 
cialism, flourishes apace. George's scorn 
of the multitude, die Allzuvielen, is as 
sweeping as Nietzsche's. The pessimism 
in regard to contemporary conditions and 



570 



THE DIAL 



[December 6 



the aristocratic aloofness which are al- 
most inevitable concomitants of the 
doctrine of art for art's sake are all- 
pervasive. He has succeeded in preserv- 
ing his detachment even in the present 
war and has resolutely refused to make 
his art serve the patriotic muse. But that 
his silence implies reprobation of Ger- 
many's conduct, no man can say. He is 
merely au-dessus de la melee. 

It has seemed advisable to emphasize 
the content rather than the form or Stefan 
George's poetry because of the persistent 
legend that he is obsessed by technique and 
is little better than a juggler of words. 
Formally, indeed, his verse is remarkable 
enough. It is doubtful whether any other 
German poet has equaled him in verbal 
skill or in the achievement of a harmony 
of sound that is at once so sumptuous and 
grave. His style is exceedingly compact, 
with an abundance of compound words and 
a frequent use of a genitive phrase in lieu 
of a whole clause. The numerous exple- 
tives with which layer German versifiers 
so often eke out their lines are rigidly 
eschewed by him. Metrically he is no 
great innovator, his favorite measure 
being a simple four-line stanza with mas- 
culine- ftid feminine rhymes alternating. 
His greatest virtuosity is shown in his use 
of rhymes, where he has revealed unsus- 
pected resources in the German language. 
"Hat ein Kiinstler einmal zwei Worte 
miteinander gereimt," he has declared, 
"so ist eigentlich das Spiel fur ihn ver- 
braucht, und er soil es nie oder selten 
wiederholen." That is, of course, a coun- 
sel of perfection which not even his dis- 
ciplined talent has been able to fulfil to 
the letter. But the combinations dear to 
the heart of the facile rhymester 
(for example, Herz-Schmerz, Brust-Lust, 
Liebe-Triebe) are totally absent from his 
writings. Alliteration and assonance are 
freely, almost lavishly, employed, though 
with more discrimination than Swinburne 
was accustomed to show. One runs con- 
stantly across such lines as these: 

Ein Wind utnweht uns f ruhlingswcich ; 
Sengende Strahlen senken sich wieder; 
Und Luft und Land in lautrem Golde schwammen. 

But George is never content with mere 
sensuous appeal, as might be inferred from 
a superficial reading of his dictum that 



"den wert der Dichtung entscheidet nicht 
der Sinn sondern die Form." Thought 
and expression are inseparably wedded in 
his ideal and in his practice. His service 
of beauty is not incompatible with ideas, 
convictions, or aspirations. Art for art's 
sake, then, never degenerates into art for 
technique's sake in the work of this austere 
poet whose lyrics are, nevertheless, per- 
haps the best example of that striving after 
perfection of form which is one of the most 
distinguishing marks of German literature 
during the last quarter of a century.

The Structure of Lasting Peace 
III 

NATIONALITY AND THE ECONOMIC LIFE OF 

STATES 

The doctrine of sovereignty was a trans- 
fer of "the divinity which hedgeth about a 
king" from the king to the body-politic as 
such. It helped to protect states against 
the aggression of piratical dynasts, and 
peoples against the strengthening of their 
exploiters' hands from without. Inter- 
fering in the internal affairs of a state is 
down in the books as the international 
crime: internal affairs, like the English- 
man's home, were a government's castle, 
from mediaeval times taboo against entry 
and search. None the less, instances of 
international entry and search count up 
heavily, sometimes with good excuse and 
benevolent motives, as in the case of the 
Hay note to Rumania or some aspects of 
the interference of the Powers in the Bal- 
kan embroilments; mostly, however, on the 
pretence of guarding capital-investing 
"nationals," or "self-defence, or what not. 
They occur in states too weak to resist 
China, Persia, Turkey, Morocco, Belgium, 
Serbia. Not even America meddled with 
Russia's "internal affairs," though there 
was better cause than even in the case of 
Rumania, and not even Russia with Aus- 
tria's, though there was as good cause as 
in the case of Turkey. In point of fact, 
sovereignty undefended by force is empty 
politically, and where an economic relation 
exists between one state and another, a lie 
economically. 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



571 



Even with the maximum of political 
reality, sovereignty cannot withstand the 
undermining effect of economic enterprise, 
particularly the enterprise of the modern 
industrial and commercial system. This 
system has automatically generated the 
economic interdependence of all mankind. 
Differences in basic natural resources give 
the inhabitants of some parts of the world 
natural monopoly of one or another raw 
material that can best be converted into a 
finished product in another part of the 
world. There exists in the economy of 
mankind a rough division of labor between 
the peoples of the earth, a division depend- 
ent on their resources and their abilities, 
but kept rudimentary, reduplicative, and 
wasteful because the community of interest 
which such a division implies is restricted 
by governmental policies of particularism, 
which are partly a survival in the medi- 
sevalism of the European dynastic systems, 
largely a traditional privilege of interest- 
and rent-receiving classes. The particu- 
larism of warfare has served only to 
exhibit more clearly how contrary it is to 
its own needs, how doubly dependent 
modern states are on each other at just 
those points where their independence is 
most vigorously flaunted. For example: 
Indispensable engines of war require rub- 
ber, sulphuric acid, nitrates, manganese. 
Rubber is to be had mostly from Brazil, 
the East Indies, the Straits Settlements; 
sulphur, in commercial quantities, only in 
the United States, in Japan, in Sicily, and 
pyrites, from which it may be derived, 
largely in Spain; nitrates only in Chile; 
manganese only in Russia, India, and Bra- 
zil. The blockade which cuts Germany off 
from these things cuts her off from neces- 
saries of war, and from how many other 
necessaries, besides food, does it not cut 
her off ! Her denial of international obli- 
gation can be made effective only through 
international obligation. Hence her de- 
mand for the "freedom of the seas" in 
wartime. Try as she will, she cannot, in 
the nature of things, be a modern state and 
conduct a modern war, and be "self-suffi- 
cient." Nor can any other state. 

This means that sea-rule is of paramount 
importance to all the states, for it is 
dominion of the trade-arteries, which are 
the life-arteries of the world, the greatest 



potentiality of victory in war and of 
aggrandizement in peace. This rule has 
been England's and it has been one of mag- 
nanimity and justice. But suppose that she 
had elected it should not be. 

Obviously, there is ground for con- 
sideration in the claim for "freedom of the 
seas." The power and authority to police 
them ought not to rest in the interest or 
the whim of one state alone. Freedom 
of the seas is like freedom of the streets : 
it requires a traffic policeman and a sema- 
phore but the policeman must not be a 
law unto himself. Responsibility for the 
security of the international highways is 
international responsibility. Police power 
can assure guaranteed protection only 
when it is responsible to a democratically 
constituted international authority, under 
whose administration must come not only 
the ways upon the high seas, but terri- 
torially contiguous sea roads, like the Dar- 
danelles, Gibraltar, the Suez and the 
Panama canals, and the harbor outlets to 
these ways, like Trieste, for landlocked 
countries, like Austria and the, Balkan 
states (it must not be forgotten that the 
whole quarrel between Serbia and Bulgaria 
turned upon Serbia's demand of access to 
the sea), and for ice-bound countries, like 
Russia. Restriction of access, discrimina- 
tion between states in the use of these 
ways, have defined interstate relationships 
and motivated policies of aggrandizement 
ending invariably in war. For access or 
control have meant exclusive sovereignty 
or sea power. Peace, of which the 
economic interdependence of nations is the 
backbone, can last only through the inter- 
national control of international highways 
and terminals which this interdependence 
implies. Freedom of the seas means this 
and nothing else. It means the divorce of 
sovereignty from sea power. 

Such a divorce would help little, how- 
ever, without the coordinate divorce of 
sovereignty from trade and industry. The 
liaison of these two maintains the tariff 
system and requires the flag to follow the 
dollar. In his "New Freedom" Mr. Wil- 
son has made a very clear statement of the 
evils worked by "protection" in this 
country: how it helps to arrest industrial 
progress, hinders invention, initiative, effi- 
ciency; exploits workingmen and restrains

the right division of labor among the 
peoples of the world; employs the profits 
won through the man power of this 
country for the exploitation of the 
resources and populations of other coun- 
tries. And what is true of republican 
America is far truer of dynastic Germany 
or Austria or Japan. The case for free 
trade need not be here recapitulated, nor 
the fallacies of protection. What is per- 
tinent is that protection makes for war. 
It seeks to create a monopoly of produc- 
tion or distribution which the modern 
economic system will not tolerate. With- 
out tariffs overproduction at home to 
undersell abroad, scrambling for exclusive 
possession of foreign markets so provoca- 
tive of competitive armament, the immoral 
division of "backward" countries into 
"spheres of influence" and "protectorates" 
all these, and the other devices of capi- 
talistic exploitation, would have had less 
chance to wreak the social and political 
evil they are guilty of. This evil rests, in 
principle, upon the use of the power and 
machinery of the commonwealth for the 
accumulation of private property by anti- 
social methods. Since the rise of modern 
industrial society capital has, to my knowl- 
edge, failed in one case only of exploitation 
of this rent-free privilege. This is the 
case of its attempt to use the blood and 
treasure of the American Commonwealth 
for the private benefit of American capi- 
talists in Mexico. President Wilson's wise 
and firm course with regard to Mexico 
constitutes an absolute break with inter- 
national precedent. It warned foot-loose 
capital that it undertakes foreign adven- 
ture at its own risk, not the nation's. It 
creates precedent for the universal aboli- 
tion of one constant source of international 
irritation. For it compels capitalistic 
competition in undeveloped lands to 
stay as competition between individuals, 
whether personal or corporate, instead of 
becoming war between the states whence 
the capital flows. 

Only a democratic victory can convert 
this precedent into a principle. States un- 
der dynastic rule, like Germany, or Austria, 
or Japan, or Rumania, confuse economic 
prosperity with personal possession. They 
are states in which landowners are mas- 



ters (the basis of the revolution in Russia 
and the heart of the revolutionary pro- 
gramme is land-reform) without restraint, 
and in which the personal rather than the 
social control of law and property sus- 
tains the medievalism of the society whose 
leader is an autocrat and whose govern- 
ment is a bureaucracy. The social ideal is 
feudal. Its influence renders nugatory the 
social character which private property in 
modern industrial society actually pos- 
sesses, because in such states ownership 
and political rule are vested in the same 
persons, and government needs no sanc- 
tion from the governed for its continuity. 
Because the feudal order in Germany is 
older and had the right of way, it is able 
to make a tool of the highly modern indus- 
trial order which interpenetrates it, and is 
in principle its enemy. From 1870 on, the 
whole or German society was transformed 
into an engine of war to be used in a 
programme of conquest and domination. 
This programme is necessary to the secur- 
ity or the ruling power, for its rule rests 
from its beginnings upon its agreement to 
protect its subjects against enemies in 
return for their subjection. And if there 
be no enemies, self-defence demands their 
creation. Thus the whole Prusso-German 
social system derives from the fiction, 
carefully nursed and tended, of perman- 
ent international rivalries and enmities. 
The dynasty's control of education has 
made easy the manufacture and sustenance 
of a popular mood in harmony with dynas- 
tic interest. German political, economic, 
and social theory, German history and 
German theology and German metaphysics 
have all been made, by the use of govern- 
mental favor for academic place, to 
expound the dogma that international war- 
fare is the sine qua non of national prog- 
ress, that the fulfilment of "the mission of 
Germany" depends upon the sword. 
"World power or downfall I" Rule or 
ruin ! Not nations, dynasties alone face 
the necessity of these alternatives, and the 
cry for "a place in the sun," the concep- 
tion of "Mittel-Europa," the horrible 
animus against England are items in the 
dynastic struggle for self-preservation. 
The national aid and comfort to the strug- 
gler is sovereignty.

THE DIAL

That the whole affair is a fiction, a 
somnambulism, any observer of the actual 
structure of the world's economy must 
recognize. In that structure Germany 
had a distinguished and beneficent part. 
Dynastic pretensions had no share in this 
part. It was the fruit of the scientific 
assiduity, the conscientious workmanship, 
the regard for the customer, of the Ger- 
man manufacturer and merchant. These 
gave Germany an increasingly important 
"place in the sun," spreading, by their 
excellence, not only the products of Ger- 
man technological superiority, but German 
"Kultur," in South America, in the Near 
East, and the Far East, and in Europe and 
in the United States. They were wel- 
comed, too, as an enrichment of the lives 
of the peoples in those parts of the world, 
as a reinforcement in the cooperative 
enterprise of civilization. The dynasty 
demanded, however, instead of conquest 
by excellence, conquest by war possession 
and rule. "That," it declares, "cannot be 
Germanism, which is not inherent in the 
German state and does not acknowledge 
the German ruler. The German state 
must hold dominion wherever there are 
men of German stock, and if other states 
and other stocks intervene, the German 
state must hold dominion over them." 
The consequences in German diplomatic 
and spy systems, military organization, 
and duplicity are notorious. Sovereignty, 
concentrated in a dynasty, is at once an 
international bully, a vicious economic pro- 
gramme in the shape of a tariff system, a 
perversion of industry from its proper 
function, and a trampling of weak peoples 
first through exploitation, then through 
conquest and repression. 

Exploitation consists mainly in the 
manipulation of the external conditions of 
the life of a people to their disadvantage. 
Exploitation is hindering their free use of 
roads, harbors, any means of communica- 
tion without which the development of 
their resources is useless; it is appropria- 
tion of these resources or, where that is 
impolitic, discrimination against their de- 
velopment by means of a "protective" 
tariff. The second Balkan war turned on 
such limitations, as between Serbia and 
Bulgaria, and the Austro-Serb complica- 



tions which precipitated this civil war 
turned on restrictions as between Ser- 
bia and Austria-Hungary. Without sov- 
ereignty, that is, exclusive possession, a 
state is, under ordinary conditions, shut off 
from economic growth. The alternative 
has ever been rule or ruin. In this 
respect, democratic states differ from dy- 
nastic ones only in degree. 

There is a maxim that capital knows no 
nationality, that it is international, using 
nations simply for the purpose of exploit- 
ing other nations. Whether this be so or 
not, labor consciously aspires to inter- 
nationality, and its aspiration is a reflex 
from the indisputable fact that in the 
economy of mankind the wealth of nations 
is international. As soon as this economy 
is freed from the repressive stress toward 
exclusive sovereignty, it must of its own 
weight and momentum, automatically, pro- 
long peace. 

For the economic enterprise is an instru- 
ment, not an end. It provides the matter 
of the body-politic, but not its mind. This 
mind is the social personality, the national- 
ity, of a human aggregate, the product of 
its generous and spontaneous energies, of 
its free self-expression its culture. In 
this a people's personality lives and moves 
and has its being, not in the economic 
order. That is undoubtedly the founda- 
tion of our house of life, but we live not in, 
but on, the foundations. Those exist only 
for the sake of the superstructure, and 
the firmer the base, the freer and securer 
the movement of those who dwell upon it. 
An internationalized economic order is in- 
dispensable to the liberation of nationality. 
The claim to exclusive sovereignty in the 
economic world has led to repression in 
the cultural. Policies of Teutonification 
or Ottomanization or Magyarization or 
Russification applied by dynastic states to 
subject or conquered peoples were policies 
of murder of social personalities. They 
were guided by the belief that the repres- 
sion and replacement of one language and 
culture by another would lead to acquies- 
cence in foreign dominion, making foreign 
rule easier by forced abolition of its 
foreignness. Nothing could have been 
blinder. A social personality, a national- 
ity, resists murder as does an individual, 



574

and is infinitely harder to kill. Exploita- 
tion and even slavery are tolerated, as 
the non-political and non-resistant Jewish 
nationality has tolerated them. But it is 
significant that it has clung to its cultural 
integrity and spiritually dominated its 
masters. So with all nationalities. Assault 
on spiritual values is met with immediate 
and powerful resistance: it is this assault 
that makes war between civilized peoples 
most of all inevitable. 

Historically the assault derives from a 
false equation which the necessities of 
dynastic survival in the modern world 
formulate. The political state, declares 
the equation, is identical with its economic 
interests and its economic interests with its 
nationality. Once more we have the dogma 
of exclusive sovereignty. Its falsity also 
in this form need not be argued. We may 
observe the precedent and example of its 
contradictory in the economic history of 
the "sovereign states" of the United States 
of America, a nation of local state govern- 
ments and diversified nationalities, freely 
associating as cultural groups, freely co- 
operating in the free trade of interstate 
commerce, its members citizens at once of 
the American Commonwealth and of the 
respective states. Time was when eco- 
nomic rivalry was as bitter between these 
states as between the European, and tariff 
wars and military conflict were not un- 
heard of. But our federal system has 
allowed the prosperity of each state to 
act, as in the course of nature it had to, 
as a direct function of the prosperity of 
its fellows. There is no silly talk about 
"the balance of trade" between states, and 
other incidents of bookkeeping. The 
ineluctable fact of the interdependence 
of the "sovereign states" is incorporated 
into, not opposed by, the laws of the states. 
International commerce is only interstate 
commerce writ large and the problems 
of its control and regulation are of the 
same kind. The ineluctable fact of the eco- 
nomic interdependence of mankind must 
be written into the laws of nations as it 
has been written into those of the states. 
Law must declare and reenforce the fact 
that the foundation of national prosperity 
is international comity. Law must pro- 



vide for equality of commercial oppor- 
tunity for equal access to undeveloped 
lands, to raw materials, to carriers, to har- 
bors, to markets. Law must provide for 
the freedom of the highways of the world 
to the peoples of the world. These are 
the economic implications of the "princi- 
ple of nationality," and so the safeguards 
of lasting peace. 

Their attainment has for its first con- 
dition that there be banished from the 
council of nations any power whose exist- 
ence is identified in fact as well as in 
assumption with a programme of exclu- 
sive sovereignty. Such an identity exists 
in the case of dynastic governments of rule 
or ruin, so that President Wilson's refusal 
to treat with the present German govern- 
ment is well-advised. But it must not be 
forgotten that there are others. 

Let no one regard the enactment and 
administration or such law as Utopian. 
Even realpolitiker, like Mr. Root, and 
congenital tories, like Mr. Roosevelt, will 
admit that in our present alliance against 
the murderous German dynasty necessity 
has forced at terrible cost what intelli- 
gence could have achieved with ease. We 
of America and our allies are to-day 
avowedly what we have long been uncon- 
sciously, a cooperative economic commu- 
nity. We do maintain what is practically 
a free trade, we have pooled our carriers, 
we have internationalized the world's 
highways, we are preventing profiteering 
in restraint of international trade. Our 
commerce with our allies has become a 
rudimentary interstate commerce. Our 
economic interests are socialized, and the 
socialization is in effect a limitation upon 
the sovereignty of each state in the 
alliance. At the same time the acknowledg- 
ment and recognition of the social person- 
alities, the nationalities within the alliance, 
is enhanced, even of Australia and Can- 
ada. That is what cooperation does. If 
it is an advantage for the wastage of war, 
what may it not mean for the use of peace I 
Its form and technique need only to be 
studied, perfected, and extended, to 
become the form and technique of the life 
of nations under the provisions of a demo- 
cratically established peace.

Reading for Children 



We take it for granted that children 
will read. Reading is so important an 
instrument in present-day adjustment that 
we expect it of every person as a matter 
of course. We depend so much upon 
reading for our intercourse with others, 
with those who are separated from us in 
space or in time, that we are very apt to 
attribute to reading certain powers and 
virtues that really belong elsewhere, and 
we are apt to value reading as something 
having a virtue of its own. And thus we 
are in danger of overlooking the very ob- 
jects that reading is to serve. 

For the youngest readers the book may 
be a source of entertainment, since the 
story interest is prominent; and reading 
becomes for many a form of passive in- 
dulgence and absorption that calls for little 
action or thinking. But while it is legiti- 
mate to use books, both for younger chil- 
dren and for older ones, as a form of 
entertainment, the danger suggested lies 
not in the books themselves, but in other 
elements of the child's environment as 
the lack of stimulus or opportunity for in- 
teresting activities. The other purposes 
of reading can be more easily attained if 
the child early becomes familiar with the 
use of books; and this is made possible if 
the association with reading is from the 
beginning a pleasant one. 

The story interest of the young child is 
used almost unconsciously the world over 
as a channel for stimulation and inspira- 
tion. The fairy and folk tales of all coun- 
tries satisfy the interest and at the same 
time suggest crude interpretations of na- 
ture and elemental aspirations, in keeping 
with the child's mental and emotional de- 
velopment. They reach the child's 
imagination at a time when he can easily 
project himself into the personality of the 
hero, and thus enrich his vicarious experi- 
ence in a large variety of relations and 
situations which he can appreciate. 

That the "morals" of many fairy and 
folk tales are at least dubious, is gener- 
ally recognized. They do indeed often 
teach the triumph of virtue, but quite as 
often the advantage of deceit and cun- 
ning. Or they teach that might makes 



right quite as often as the converse. Nev- 
ertheless, these primitive stories have their 
value, although they should not be ad- 
ministered in excessive quantities. Per- 
haps the best antidotes to the undesirable 
fairy tales are other fairy tales that is, 
tales from varied sources. The different 
manner and the contrasting mode of 
thought suggested by Hungarian and 
Irish tales, by Chinese and Danish tales, 
help to widen the outlook and the sympa- 
thies when a more restricted repertory is 
likely to fix prejudice and intolerance. 

The myths and hero tales stress courage 
and fidelity and self-confidence, and fur- 
nish a natural transition to the romance 
and chivalry of early adolescence. At 
every stage so far these stories give body 
to the common racial aspirations, they 
help to clarify certain types of ideals, and 
to interpret the familiar human relations. 
As they "feed the imagination," they lay 
the foundation for the later appreciation 
of poetry. 

The personal interest that makes these 
earlier forms of literature so appealing to 
young children can be directed into history 
and biography. The value of the latter 
is commonly exaggerated on the assump- 
tion that they furnish important informa- 
tion. The chief value, at least so far as 
the development of ideals and standards 
is concerned, would seem to lie in their 
concreteness and reality rather than in the 
specific significance of the facts and events 
they teach. The drama and the best fic- 
tion give the child more valuable pictures 
of life than he is likely to get from his- 
tory and biography as they are ordinarily 
written. History and biography are 
needed to assure him that the truths of 
fiction are substantially representative. 

Like the "unreal" stories considered 
suitable for younger children, history and 
biography should teach about people and 
plots, about conflict of purposes and of 
ideals, about achievement and failure. 
And above all, in selecting books of this 
class, we must guard the child against 
books written to cultivate intolerance and 
chauvinism and bigotry. People and 
events should carry the reader beyond his 



576 



THE DIAL 



[December 6 



village and his neighbors, and bring him 
close to men and women of worth in all 
times and all places. 

The many and diverse appeals to the 
buyer of books for children tend to con- 
fusion, with the frequent result that 
recourse is had to the old and safe stand- 
ards of our own earlier years. We know 
that our reading did not hurt us, and as- 
sume that therefore it is harmless for the 
new generation. And it is true that the 
reprints of older juvenile literature repre- 
sent the survivors in a rather severe se- 
lective process. Yet in many respects the 
newer books written especially for chil- 
dren have decided advantages over their 
tried competitors holding over from the 
past. 

In the first place, the purposeful books 
of the past were written down to the chil- 
dren, for the most part diluted and 
simplified versions of adventure and mor- 
alities conceived essentially from the 
adult point of view. With our greatly 
extended knowledge of the child's mind, 
the new juvenile literature is better 
adapted to reach the interest, the under- 
standing, and the emotions of the young 
reader. It is, so to speak, more "effi- 
cient" as a vehicle for transmitting ideas 
or moral impulses. 

In the second place, the external world 
of human relations has changed so rap- 
idly within the lifetime of the parents of 
the children that books which were ade- 
quate sources of information concerning 
foreign countries, how people live, indus- 
trial conditions, and so on, are no longer 
adequate except perhaps as "historical" 
documents. As sources of information, 
books of travel, books on man's achieve- 
ments, even fiction, must be quite recent 
if the child is to get from them a reliable 
picture of the social world in which he 
lives. The books that relate the strug- 
gles and triumphs of the boy or girl who 
went to work at an early age and even- 
tually married the employer's daughter 
(or son, as the case might be) no doubt 
did well enough in their day; one could 
make a lengthy catalogue of their virtues. 
But there should be no place for these 
books in the hands of children to-day: for 



one thing, there are not enough sons and 
daughters of employers to go round. 

In the third place, much of youth's read- 
ing is to meet the normal craving for a 
rationalized interpretation of nature's 
mysteries; and the older books necessarily 
overlooked the great discoveries in every 
department of science. There are com- 
paratively few children who will care to 
pursue science and nature studies inten- 
sively; but every child should at least have 
the opportunity to have his questions 
answered in accordance with the best 
knowledge of our times. The newer books 
in this field are not only more valuable 
because of the more trustworthy informa- 
tion they contain; but they are coming 
more and more to be characterized by a 
modern point of view. 

There is a peculiarly persistent Victor- 
ian affectation that there are some books 
that "every child should know." This 
notion has its roots in the renaissance ; but 
it needs to have its branches pruned. 
Every child should know the world in 
which he lives as thoroughly as it lies in 
him to know it. This world includes tra- 
ditional lore and characters, "classic" tales 
and long-enduring, if not eternal, verities. 
It is well to assimilate a great deal of this 
intellectual background. But it is more 
urgent to learn the present world and the 
world in which he is going to live. Some 
children are inclined to organize their 
ideas on a basis of historical retrospect 
they ask, What came before that, and be- 
fore that? Others, however, no less in- 
telligent and no less valuable as social 
assets, seem to be quite indifferent to what 
went before; they are the pragmatists who 
ask, What of it? and look to see what 
can be done here and now. Moreover, 
while the classics should be accessible to 
all, it is worse than useless to cultivate an 
affectation of appreciation for "the best" 
and it is desirable to cultivate the reali- 
zation that classics are always and every- 
where in the process of making. 

Guidance in reading is not a thing by 
itself. Like other efforts to direct chil- 
dren's development, it must take into ac- 
count individual differences, capacities, 
and needs. Reading must reach the in- 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



577 



terests of the child as he is, not as we 
think he ought to be. And it must be 
opportune, not only from considerations 
of local and temporary conditions and 
events, but from the viewpoint of the 
child. 

Much thought has been given to 
building up a new literature for younger 
children. More needs just now to be 
given by parents and teachers to the in- 
troduction of the young reader to lit- 
erature intended primarily for adults. 
The transition from the reading of juven- 
iles to the reading of books intended 
primarily for adults is beset by special 
difficulties, like all other transitions in 
the child's adjustment. Parents and 
teachers should face the situation with 
more assurance, however, than is com- 
mon. We do not seem to hesitate about 
placing in the hands of young people the 
adult novels of a past generation those 
of Dickens, Scott, or Victor Hugo. 
Neither should we fear to give them ac- 
cess to the good novels of contemporary 
writers. Mrs. Fisher's "The Bent 
Twig," Ernest Poole's "The Harbor," or 
Joseph Conrad's "Under Western Eyes," 
as beginners, may contain a great deal 
that is "over the head" of the boy or girl. 
But there is no harm in that, and in gen- 
eral we must recognize that a high-grade 
piece of fiction will contain more than 
most readers can immediately assimilate; 
the young reader will get what he can, 
and he is likely to ignore what does not 
concern him. 

It is out of the question for any per- 
son to read everything that must be passed 
upon before being offered to children's 
use. It is necessary to consult annotated 
lists of classified reading, made up by 
librarians or others interested primarily 
in selection, rather than by dealers or pub- 
lishers, who are interested primarily in 
marketing. And since it is possible to 
obtain competent counsel about particular 
books, the value and the character of chil- 
dren's reading ought to rise about as fast 
as we care to give the problem our best 
thought.

Literary Affairs in France 

(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 
Louise de La Valliere, the mistress of Louis 
XIV, ended her days, as everybody knows, in 
a Carmelite convent, where she died in 1710 
at the age of 64. Mile. Eve Lavalliere, who 
is not yet 64 although she is a grandmother, 
seems to have been moved by the example of 
her celebrated namesake, for it has been an- 
nounced recently that she is about to leave the 
stage for the Carmelite order. She was inter- 
viewed in her apartment in the Champs Ely- 
sees, stripped of its furniture, where the re- 
porters found her in the kitchen by the side of 
her truckle-bed, dressed in rough material and 
accompanied only by a faithful dog and an 
equally faithful and weeping maid. Mile. La- 
valliere informed the reporters that a country 
cure had led her to a state of grace during her 
last summer holiday; "if you only knew," she 
said, "what happiness it is to have faith." This 
is, unfortunately, an age of skepticism and the 
project of the popular actress of the Varietes has 
been somewhat skeptically received in Paris. In 
the "Temps" M. Paul Souday has pointed out 
that, although the transition from the stage to 
the convent is not extraordinary, perhaps even 
quite natural, he cites the historic example of 
Thai's, the doors of Carmelite convents are not 
open to anybody that chooses to walk in, and 
Mile. Lavalliere does not seem yet to have taken 
the necessary preliminary steps. He suggests that 
her decision is not perhaps final and, indeed, it is 
already rumored that she may shortly be seen 
again on a Parisian stage. When I last saw her, 
some little time before the war, she had the part 
of a boy of sixteen in M. Nepoty's play, "Les 
Petits," at the Theatre Antoine, and she both 
looked and played it to perfection. 

M. Paul Geraldy's first play, "Les Noces d'Ar- 
gent," has just been published by Messieurs Cres 
in a volume at four francs. The reading of it 
has confirmed the impression that its first per- 
formance at the Comedie Franchise made on me ; 
it is the best play that we have been given for 
a very long time and altogether a remarkable 
work which promises well for the dramatic fu- 
ture of its young author. Its theme is the tyr- 
anny of the family, especially in France, a 
tyranny arising from affection but no less dis- 
astrous on that account. We see the inevitable 
misunderstandings and estrangements between 
parents and children caused by the failure of the

former to understand that their offspring, at a 
certain age, have the right to direct their own 
lives. Perhaps the play would not be fully 
understood in America or England, where par- 
ents do not, as many do here, expect their chil- 
dren even when they are married and have set 
up homes of their own to live in their pockets, 
so to speak, and to ask their opinion on every 
occasion. But even in America and England 
there is often the failure of the older generation 
to understand that the younger is not necessarily 
wrong because it does not accept all the opinions 
and judgments of its elders. It is amusing to 
observe how often even men that have been 
counted as "advanced" and really were so up to 
a certain age, become at that age fixed in their 
opinions and accessible to no new ideas and are 
the most determined opponents of any views more 
advanced than their own. The conservatism of 
the middle-aged is one of the chief obstacles to 
the progress of the world. There are certain 
faults in M. Geraldy's play ; he sometimes forces 
the note. Thus, the parting of the daughter 
from her parents after her marriage at the end 
of the first act is not quite natural. Even a 
French jeune fille, who sometimes marries merely 
in order to get a little liberty, does not leave the 
home of her childhood without regret. The 
tyranny of the bourgeois French family is begin- 
ning to break down young girls, in particular, 
are acquiring more liberty and that detestable 
word "convenable" is losing its power but "Les 
Noces d'Argent" is still timely. 

A wholesome corrective to the indiscriminating 
abuse of the Russian Revolution, which has been 
too common here, will be found in M. Charles 
Rivet's book, "Le Dernier Romanoff" (Paris; 
Perris). M. Rivet, who was for a long time 
the Petrograd correspondent of the "Temps," 
gives an account of the old regime which should 
convince the most conservative that any change 
must have been for the better. When one real- 
izes the appalling heritage of bankruptcy and 
universal disorganization that Tsarism left to 
the revolution, one understands the present 
situation in Russia, which can never be put 
straight so long as the war lasts. Instead of 
condemning the Russians for wanting peace, we 
ought to sympathize with their tragic situation 
and admire their heroism in standing loyally by 
their Allies and refusing to accept the separate 
peace which they could have to-morrow on the 
most favorable terms. 



The Italian defeat has naturally renewed the 
pessimistic tendencies that American intervention 
in the war had dissipated. When America came 
in, a victory for the Central Empires seemed 
quite impossible, and now they have shown that 
they are still capable of inflicting a serious blow 
on the Allies. That does not mean that they 
will obtain the ultimate victory, but everybody 
here realizes how serious would be the conse- 
quences if the north of Italy were occupied by 
the enemy. It need not, of course, be assumed 
that that will happen ; we can still hope that the 
advance of the Germans and Austrian* will be 
checked, but opinion is prepared to face the 
worst, if it should come. 

Many people share the opinion of M. Briand 
that it was a mistake to refuse consideration of 
the peace proposals made to him by Germany. 
If it be true, as M. Briand says, that Germany 
was prepared to restore the complete independ- 
ence of Belgium, cede Trieste and the Tridentine 
to Italy, and even, on conditions, Alsace-Lor- 
raine to France, it might have been wiser to 
allow M. Briand to go to Switzerland to meet 
Prince von Biilow, as he was invited to do. He 
would then have been able to ascertain whether 
the proposals were really serious and, if so, to 
obtain a definite and detailed programme to lay 
before the other Allies. It would be impossible 
to make peace at the expense of Russia, but the 
demands of Germany in regard to Russian ter- 
ritory might have been withdrawn in the course 
of negotiations. Evidently Germany will never 
make a peace proposal that the Allies can accept 
as it stands without discussion. The sole ques- 
tion is whether every proposal is to be refused 
at once without examination. M. Briand con- 
siders that M. Ribot put the matter in such a 
way to the British, Italian, and Russian govern- 
ments that a negative reply on their part was 
inevitable. The Chamber, at its secret session 
on October 16, seems to have taken M. Briand 's 
view, for M. Ribot was obliged to retire from 
office in consequence of his conduct in the matter. 
The first proposals were made to M. Briand 
through the intermediary of a distinguished Bel- 
gian, who has remained in his own country since 
the German occupation and was allowed to 
come to France through Switzerland to see M. 
Briand. Both the Belgian and the Rumanian 
governments agreed with M. Briand that the 
German proposals, without being acceptable as 
they stood, were a sufficient basis for negotia- 
tions.

Internal politics are still in a disturbed con- 
dition, owing to the various politico-judicial "af- 
fairs." M. Leon Daudet's letter to the Presi- 
dent of the Republic accusing M. Malvy, late 
minister of the interior, of treason, caused an 
immense sensation. The government, after hav- 
ing refrained from prosecuting M. Daudet for 
calumnious denunciation, made the mistake of 
accusing the royalist league, the Action Fran- 
gaise, of which M. Daudet is a leading member, 
of a plot against the Republic. After numerous 
police raids no conclusive evidence of a plot was 
discovered and the charge had to be abandoned.

Henry James and the Untold 
Story 

THE IVORY TOWER and THE SENSE OF THE PAST. 
By Henry James. (Charles Scribner's Sons; 
each, $1.50.) 

In these two posthumous fragments of Henry 
James we find consummation without comple- 
tion consummation of the author as spectacle, 
as object of the appreciative regard, without com- 
pletion of either of his cherished pieces of ma- 
terial. It is not too much to say that the stroke 
which cuts these off, at the end of the first third 
or thereabout, has the undesigned yet singularly 
valuable effect of turning Henry James himself 
into the hero, the very centre and fulcrum of 
interest, of either tale; Henry James being here 
the name for a particular kind of appreciation of 
life fused with a particular kind of fictional 
method. These two, the appreciation and the 
method become one, make up the whole of our 
later Henry James not, one hastens to add, 
because he narrowed his appreciation to the con- 
fines of a narrow and special method, but be- 
cause he deepened and intensified his method 
until it included the sum of his appreciation of 
life. He became our one example of the per- 
fected identity of the man with the artist 
through the evolution of the artist, not through 
the devolution of the man. It is of this evolu- 
tion and this identity that we get, in "The Ivory 
Tower" and "The Sense of the Past," the 
uniquely clinching evidence. 

Each of the tales breaks off but to leave us 
in possession of three- or four-score pages of dic- 
tated "notes," wherein we see the author think- 
ing himself toward and into his subject, feeling 
his way about in it, studying it in every bear- 
ing and implication, recording and strengthening 
his possession of it, watching its possibilities more 
and more radiantly dawn for him. In these 
notes, never meant for print, we have our dis- 
covery and our compensating thrill. We must 
indeed do without the accustomed thrill: that 
of the Henry James subject wrought through 
to the catching of every thread into its place 
in the pattern, until the whole becomes instantly 
accessible at one pounce of the reader's atten- 
tion. But to have had that would have been to 
miss the excitement of this other triumph, the 
capture, not of Henry James's subject, but of 
Henry James himself in the act of capturing it. 
Elsewhere we behold his spectacle rtaking, in the 
measure of our responsiveness, his point of view 



580 



THE DIAL 



[December 6 



and his place, becoming in truth himself. Here 
we behold rather the beholder. We see his 
mind perform upon his material the very op- 
erations our minds would have to perform upon 
the finished story if it existed ; we trace his whole 
coherent series of guesses, anticipations, specula- 
tions, doubts, solutions; we see him in short as 
an absorbed reader of the stories that were not 
yet written, precisely as we have ourselves been 
readers of the other stories, the ones that are 
written. Elsewhere, the Henry James story 
gives itself up to the reader. Here, it is only 
to the author that it gives itself up; and what 
the reader gets is the author himself. The 
prefaces to the New York edition give us a re- 
trospective account of how Henry James told the 
story that cannot be told ; they are jotted notes of 
how a done thing was done. But these newer 
and more astounding notes are prefaces in a 
much more elemental sense: prefaces, not to an 
edition, but to the very doing of a thing for- 
ever to remain undone. 

That, and the publication of both documents 
at once, constitutes their equality and their unity. 
There is no other equality ; and the circumstances 
in common between the two projects emphasize, 
as hardly anything else could, their differences 
in pretension, in design, in scope. "The Ivory 
Tower," if a great thing, is great in the smallest 
ways associable with its author. A study essen- 
tially of money, of those who have it not and 
of those who have it thrust upon them, of the 
lengths to which some will go, and others will 
not, to get it or keep it, the story probes shrewdly 
into some aspects of our American social scene. 
But it belongs among such late and relatively 
little things as "The Outcry" and "The Sacred 
Fount," without the beguiling farce of the one 
or the uniquely confessional purpose of the other. 
It confirms and ratifies, it annotates, it re- 
exhibits an artificer supremely concerned with 
the alternation and distribution of his points 
of view, passionately and gaily resolved "to 
achieve the lucidity with the complexity"; but 
it changes or enlarges nothing. "The Sense 
of the. Past," on the other hand, changes every- 
thing. It alters the shape, pushes out the bounds, 
of the whole Henry James world, adds a sub- 
stantial figure to the sum of imaginings, achieve- 
ments, beauties, perfections. Fitly, James could 
turn back to it from his appreciation of Rupert 
Brooke, at a time when "The Ivory Tower" 
had ceased to hold him. "The Sense of the 



Past" promised all the rich, full orchestral reso- 
nance of novels such as "The Ambassadors" and 
"The Wings of the Dove"; yet, in its entire 
dissimilarity from anything else that even James 
could have written, it is as isolated and self- 
sufficing as "The Great Good Place" or "The 
Madonna of the Future" or "The Turn of the 
Screw." Not even its author had ever under- 
taken to add such warmth and spaciousness of 
treatment to such amazing virtuosity of design. 

It is easier on the whole to describe the design 
than the treatment, and by that law which makes 
it easier to describe a product of fancy than one 
of imagination. It is a trick of the fancy that 
James practised upon Ralph Pendrel, the "first 
young man" of "The Sense of the Past." An 
oddly untraveled, unworldly young American 
man, author of "An Essay in Aid of the Read- 
ing of History," in love with a notion of his 
own that the spirit of time past can be recovered 
as no one has yet had the fine sensibility to 
recover it, he tumbles through such an open 
trapdoor of the bygone as not his most extrava- 
gant moment could have dreamed the existence 
of. On the death of a distant English cousin 
he "comes in for" a house in London, "some- 
thing strange and storied, ancient and alien." 
Hardly sooner has he taken his first preliminary 
peep at it than he exchanges identities with a 
young man of 1820 a young man in one of 
the portraits within the house. His "sense of 
the past" projects him, we are given to under- 
stand, into the period, the personal situation, 
the very love story, of that remote ancestral rel- 
ative, his other self of 1820; which other self, 
a person with an exactly corresponding "sense 
of the future," is left in turn to explore the 
strange delights of his future that is, the pres- 
ent out of which Pendrel has just dropped. 

These paired situations, that of the modern 
young man fallen into the wrong century to 
take up in media* res the love story of his proto- 
type, carrying it forward with a vaguely sensed 
disquietude and "malaise," and that of his shad- 
owy alter ego projected forward by a century 
into a modern and alien world what do they not 
mean, in possibilities, values, "force and felicity," 
to Henry James? They mean, of course, every- 
thing; or at least they promise everything, and 
would as surely have meant it had he been given 
the time to make them do so. But, centrally 
and especially, they mean the general superiority 
and Tightness of the present as compared with 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



581 



the past. This was Henry James's faith, one 
deciphers, as well as his paradox. Loving old 
perfections as he did, he yet had the grace to see 
that only the lapse of time had made them old; 
precisely in time lapsed is our modern advantage, 
our thing to value. It is only on the present that 
everything else comes to focus, only for it that 
everything was made. This, surely, is the mean- 
ing of Pendrel's "malaise" as he falls in love with 
the wrong sister and tries to make himself believe 
that she is the right one; this is the meaning 
of his instinctive cry at first sight of the right 
sister: "'Why she's modern, modern!" The 
same meaning is wrought into Pendrel's dim, 
groping sense of the chivalrous amenities and 
gentilities of modern intercourse, the like of 
which he looks for in vain in the hard and 
rather too grossly hearty Georgian social life; 
it is wrought as well into the others' blank fail- 
ure to make him out, their conclusion that what 
is really the stifled modern in him can only be 
a queer kind of transatlantic cleverness. And, 
most touchingly, it is suggested in the pained and 
protesting reappearances of Ralph's alter ego, 
who, poor troubled ghost, is no more quite con- 
tent with his fulfilled dream of the future than 
is Ralph with his of the past, and who must 
return to show a hurt face on the occasions of 
Ralph's doing and feeling such things as no 
youth of 1820 could have done and felt. 

The chief of these "deflections" is Ralph's ap- 
preciation of the right, the "modern," sister, 
who makes him feel "the beautiful pity of her 
divination" of his malaise. To her, in what was 
evidently to have been a movingly climactic 
scene a faire, Ralph pours out everything that 
he means, everything that the author too means, 
about past and present. Even the denatured 
prose of the notes opens here immense perspectives 
of emotion, of effect, of truth: "For it would 
seem to me kind of sublime that he now, at 
last now, opening up, opening out, everything 
that he has had before to keep back, tells her 
such things about those fruitions of the Future 
which have constituted his state, tells her of 
how poor a world she is stuck fast in compared 
with all the wonders and splendours that he is 
straining back to, and of which he now sees only 
the ripeness, richness, attraction and civilisation, 
the virtual perfection without a flaw, that she 
stands dazzled before it and can only be shut 
up in the heartbreak of remaining so far back 
behind it, so dismally and excludedly out of it, 



while he, with her assistance, shaking her off 
after he has, as it were, used her, wins his way 
back to it and out of her sight and sense for 
ever." 

There are more meanings here than can be 
convoyed into so narrow a harbor as this review. 
There is, for example, abundant suggestion of 
the way Henry James valued the past that is, 
as something best worth knowing because to 
know it lends sense and direction to one's love of 
the present, which must, out of dead things, faded 
beauties, livingly re-create itself. Here too is 
the disproof not indeed that we could not find 
it everywhere else of Miss Rebecca West's the- 
ory of Henry James's "odd lack of the historic 
sense." "He had," she writes, "a tremendous 
sense of the thing that is and none at all of the 
thing that has been, and thus he was always being 
misled by such lovely shells of the past as Hamp- 
ton Court into the belief that the past which 
inhabited them was as lovely." Other judg- 
ments, of the same critic and of others, are put 
out of countenance by this most challenging of 
the books that can never be written. 

But I brush aside a dozen such matters to end 
on a suggestion that in "The Sense of the Past" 
we have the rounding out and ultimate logic of 
the international novel as Henry James created 
it. His one constant material formula was to 
study different, not necessarily opposed, types of 
breeding at their best that is, crystallized each 
in its best possible human products. That he 
does even in "The Ivory Tower," where, al- 
though the characters are of American extraction, 
the hero's attitude toward most things, and es- 
pecially toward money, is more of the Old World 
than of the New. He had done the same in 
such early novels as "Roderick Hudson" and 
"The American." Most often, his types of 
bestness cross oceans to produce their effects on 
each other; sometimes they touch across gaps of 
time, as in "The Aspern Papers," a drama of 
generations, epochs; rarely, they overleap the 
very barriers of our common materiality, to live 
for a few breaths, as in "The Great Good Place," 
for beauty or for terror that knows nothing of 
local habitations and names. In "The Sense of 
the Past" all three of these appeals are superposed 
and fused into one. Continents and capitals 
touch; then interpenetrates with now; and both 
space and time exist only as symbols, in the time- 
less and spaceless world of the story that can- 
not be told. WILSON FOLLETT.

A Defence of Idealism 

A DIFBNCE or IDEALISM. By May Sinclair. (The 

Macmillan Co.; $2.) 

Philosophical literature is notoriously dry read- 
ing. We are accustomed to hold the subject 
responsible for the repellent style in which it 
appears, and are therefore always surprised to 
come upon a philosophical study which is under- 
standable without great effort. If, in addition, it 
sparkles with wit and good humor, as does May 
Sinclair's defence of philosophical idealism, we 
are as likely to condemn it as "popular" as to 
find it a rare achievement. 

It was like a woman to come to the defence 
of the under dog. Every dog has his day even 
in philosophy, and philosophical idealism had a 
long day. Indeed, it is difficult to tell, accord- 
ing to the author, whether the evident twilight 
of idealism follows a sunset or precedes a sun- 
rise. "There is a certain embarrassment," she 
writes, "in coming forward with an Apology 
for Idealistic Monism at the present moment. 
You cannot be quite sure whether you are put- 
ting in an appearance too late or much too 
early." Of one thing, however, we may be 
sure, she thinks, that idealistic monism, if dead, 
will be born again. It will rise again because 
it lives on in the heart of the very system that 
for the time being may have superseded it. It 
has been so over and over again since philosophic 
speculation began in the ancient East, and the 
future will be like the past. "Pragmatic Hu- 
manism and Vitalism are going from us in the 
flower, you may say, of their youth." The 
contest even now is between realism and ideal- 
ism. And the author believes "that some day 
(which may be as distant as you please) the 
New Realism will grow old and die, and the 
New Idealism will be born again." 

The argument of the book is the old one that 
all paths lead to the Absolute. Start out in ex- 
perience anywhere and there is but one resting- 
place for the spirit that seeks an explanation. 
At first sight pluralistic philosophies seem to 
have all the advantage in appealing to facts, but 
this is the superficial aspect of things; even a 
little thought always discloses the unity behind 
and within the multiplicity. In a chapter on 
"The Pan-psychism of Samuel Butler" we are 
shown that one indestructible primal energy per- 
sists through all the fluctuations of the psyche. 
A chapter on "Some Ultimate Questions of Psy- 
chology" contends that our conscious life has 
a unity which it could not have if there were no 



self unaffected by the changes characteristic of 
mental life. So, too, we read again, there is 
unity behind the phenomena of nature. "The 
law of conservation of energy is nothing if not 
a confession that, as far as the physical world 
goes, incorrigible multiplicity and difference do 
not obtain." Mysticism, realism, pragmatism, 
vitalism all are compelled to contribute to the 
force of the argument. One cannot say that 
the logic is always sound. One cannot agree, 
for example, that since science recognizes the 
ultimate constitution of matter to be energy, 
and since it is agreed that the so-called material 
qualities are not found in it, we may conclude 
that this energy is spiritual, and that following 
the path of physics we arrive inevitably at an 
absolute experience as the final reality. No; 
not always sound, but always keen, vigorous, 
lively, readable. 

It is doubtful, however, whether the book 
will please the idealists unless the idealistic tem- 
perament has recently become much less dog- 
matic as the result of successful attacks upon 
the idealistic position. Dogmatism is, at all 
events, quite foreign to May Sinclair's book. 
She aims at a tentative solution. 

It is not, and it cannot be, a question of certainty. 
No reasonable person demands certainty at this time 
of day. The utmost he is entitled to demand is a 
certain balance of probabilities. Perhaps not even 
that. Perhaps only here a balance and there a chance, 
and there, again, an off-chance, a bare possibility. 

The book is obviously an attempt to ascertain 
what exactly the various philosophical systems 
are driving at when reduced to the simplest terms 
and stated in clear English. It would be rash 
to say that she succeeds or that anyone could 
succeed in doing this. "A Defence of Idealism" 
does, however, present in clear, readable fashion 
what one clever writer after a careful examina- 
tion believes to be the strong and the weak 
points of the competing philosophies of our day, 
and as such is a suggestive book for the thought- 
ful layman and the student of philosophy who 
has not offered his soul as a sacrifice to his 
system. That she finds all philosophies com- 
pelled at last to admit a unity in things, and 
that this proves to her satisfaction that some 
form of idealism the philosophy of unity is 
on the whole the most acceptable, serves only to 
give her presentation an artistic completeness and 
to put before the reader a well-rounded argu- 
ment for a philosophical creed with which an 
educated person may be supposed to be at least 
acquainted. M .

The Future of Poland 

THE POLITICAL HISTORY OF POLAND. By Edward 
H. Lewinski-Corwin. (The Polish Book Ira- 
porting Co.) 

THE RECONSTRUCTION OF POLAND AND THE NEAR 
EAST. By Herbert Adams Gibbons. (The Cen- 
tury Co.; $1.) 

In view of what has happened, there is deep 
irony in the fact that a considerable section of 
the Polish people should only a few years ago 
have looked forward to a world war with a 
feeling of grim satisfaction. The sense of ruin 
was so keen, and the plight of the people under 
Russian and German rule was so pitiable, that 
patriots were ready to welcome a general inter- 
national conflagration as the last hope of a re- 
vived nationality. Save in the event of a wiping 
of the slate by war for a remaking of the map 
and a redistribution of political power, the Polish 
question seemed buried forever. 

In 1912 representatives of all the independence 
parties of Russian, Prussian, and Austrian Poland 
actually met and formed a committee charged 
with the task of drawing up a plan of procedure 
when the crash should come, and making mili- 
tary preparations for the expected contingency. 
The decision was, in the event of a war which 
should find Russia on one side and Austria and 
Germany on the other, to throw support to Aus- 
tria. Bitter hatred of Prussia was a strong argu- 
ment in the other direction. But of the three 
powers, Austria had dealt with the Poles most 
leniently; Russian oppression extended over 
eighty per cent of the ancient Polish republic; 
it was expected that Russia would be hopelessly 
beaten; and a federal union of a reconstituted 
Polish state with Austria and Hungary seemed 
the most desirable arrangement short of complete 
independence. 

The storm broke before even the Poles ex- 
pected it; and never was there greater disillu- 
sionment. Instead of finding themselves in a 
position to .act with deliberation and turn the 
situation to their own advantage, the unhappy 
people saw their portion of Europe become im- 
mediately one of the principal theatres of the 
war, where whole nations met in a terrible death 
grapple. From Galicia to the Dwina the coun- 
try now lies one vast scroll of horror. Further- 
more, two million Poles of military age were 
drafted into the armies of the three contending 
powers and lined up on opposite sides of the 
battle field, brother against brother; so that to 



the devastation wrought by pillage, hunger, ex- 
posure, and disease has been added that of fratri- 
cidal war. Through the fearful cloud of 
disaster that has settled upon the unhappy people 
only one ray of sunshine has broken. In No- 
vember, 1916, the Central Powers announced 
their readiness to recognize an independent king- 
dom of Poland, and subsequently the Russian 
revolutionary provisional government took a sim- 
ilar step. But as yet these declarations are 
hardly worth the paper on which they are writ- 
ten, and the fate of what remains of the Polish 
people is still in the lap of the gods. 

The story of Poland has been told for English 
readers many times, but in view of the startling 
chapter which is being added to it before our 
very eyes much interest attaches to Mr. Lewin- 
ski-Corwin's recent and up-to-date volume. In 
some 600 pages Polish political development is 
sketched from prehistoric times to the events of 
the present year. The earlier portions of the 
volume possess no special distinction. They suf- 
fer by the exclusion of economic, social, and cul- 
tural matters, and will be found drier reading, 
and no more authoritative, than two or three 
single-volume histories which have been available 
for a decade or more. The last two chapters, 
however, dealing with "constitutional Russia 
and the Poles" and "the Polish question and the 
Great War," have decided value, not alone be- 
cause they bring the story up to date, but because 
they show an unusually keen insight into the 
perplexities of the contemporary Polish problem. 
It is the author's opinion that this problem has 
never before "been so near its full and satisfac- 
tory solution"; the necessary and sufficient guar- 
antee of such a solution he finds in President 
Wilson's affirmation before the Senate, January 
22, 1917, that he took it for granted that "states- 
men everywhere are agreed that there should be 
a united, independent, and autonomous Poland." 

In his interesting essay on the future of Poland 
Mr. Gibbons attributes the promises of both the 
Central Powers and Russia to sheer expediency, 
and argues that the decisive success of either 
group of belligerents in a short war would have 
meant for the Poles "merely the passing from 
Scylla to Charybdis." He shows how incom- 
plete and provisional are the arrangements that 
have been made for the reconstituted Polish 
Kingdom, and advises the Poles to hold fast for 
the time being to their several allegiances, in the 
expectation that the self-respect of the Entente

Allies will never tolerate putting back "under 
Russian slavery" those who are loyal to Russia 
during this trial, and that, after what has hap- 
pened in Ireland, the English people cannot 
hold against the Poles of Galicia and Posnania 
the fact that they remained loyal, for the dura- 
tion of the war, to Austria and Germany. 

Mr. Gibbons shares Mr. Lewinski-Corwin's 
opinion that the only rational and enduring solu- 
tion of the Polish question is an independent 
Poland, a nation which shall be in no way sub- 
ject to either Russia or Germany. But he wisely 
warns against the temptation to press territorial 
demands too far. Polish enthusiasts loudly pro- 
claim their purpose to bring together again all 
the lands that are "historically" Polish, without 
regard to whether these lands are now predom- 
inantly Polish or capable of developing real eco- 
nomic and political solidarity. Even if the Poles 
were in a position to determine the matter single- 
handed, they would be making a great mistake 
in saddling themselves at the outset with a group 
of irredentist controversies. "No cataclysm of 
defeat," the writer properly says, "whichever 
way the war turns, is going the compel Germany 
and Russia to give up Silesia, the Prussian Baltic 
coast line, Lithuania, and Podolia, and it is 
doubtful if the Poles can make good their claims 
to the eastern portions of Galicia." 

On ethnographic and economic grounds, Mr. 
Gibbons would include in a future kingdom of 
Poland about two-thirds of German Posnania, 
the Russian kingdom of Poland (including 
Khelm), and Galicia, excluding the eastern re- 
gion known as Red Ruthenia. That a Poland 
thus constituted would rapidly "become the sev- 
enth 'great power* of Europe" we may readily 
believe; although Mr. Gibbons's estimate of the 
service to be rendered by such a nation as a 
buffer state will not instantly carry conviction. 

Of the three or four miscellaneous essays 
which complete Mr. Gibbons's volume, one 
pleads for the internationalization of Constan- 
tinople and its appurtenant European lands, an- 
other urges the formation of Syrian and 
Armenian states as a partial solution of the prob- 
lem of Asiatic Turkey, and a third advises a 
policy of "hands-off" in the Balkans. The 
author writes from long and intimate knowledge 
of eastern European politics, and his suggestions 
are worthy of the earnest attention of statesmen 
and diplomats.

A Frigid Introduction to Strauss 

RICHARD STRAUSS, THE MAN AND His WORKS. 
By Henry T. Finck. With an Appreciation of 
Strauss by Percy Grainger. (Little, Brown 
& Co.; $2.50.) 

This is a useful survey of the external facts 
touching the life and musical compositions of 
Richard Strauss. It is also, as the writer seemed 
to be very eager it should be, a reasonably en- 
tertaining volume, liberally besprinkled, as it is, 
with anecdotal matter and journalistic chit-chat. 
But it does not, on the whole, suggest that it 
has been a labor of love. Mr. Finck makes it 
abundantly clear in the course of his remarks that 
his reason for writing the book was rather the 
fact that Strauss is considered one of the greatest, 
if not the greatest, of living composers than that 
he himself considers him to be such. And the 
general tone of Mr. Finck's book is blase, some- 
times yawningly so. His own spontaneous 
reactions to Strauss are so consistently unsympa- 
thetic that he evidently fears at times to create 
in the reader an impression of unreasoning preju- 
dice; he therefore protects himself by calling on 
copious testimony from other writers. "You 
Straussianer just fight it out among yourselves," 
he seems to say, and steps back with a shrug of 
the shoulders. 

Mr. Finck's lack of sympathy is only partly 
due to Strauss's obvious shortcomings his crass 
realism of conception, his lack of a distinguished 
melodic vein, his needlessly complicated orches- 
trations, his frequent want of restraint and ten- 
dency to lapse into sheer vulgarity. We could 
hardly expect Mr. Finck to forgive Strauss these 
sins. In one of the most charming essays on 
Chopin that I have seen he has implied how 
much he understands and values the jeweled and 
the chastened in art, how ardently he loves the 
limpid flow of perfect melody and the delicious 
echo of subtle and softly pedaled harmonies. But 
melody and the glow of harmonic sequence, pre- 
cious as these are, are not the whole of music. 
The more massive qualities exhibited by Strauss 
at his best the power to fill a large canvas 
with color and movement, the titanic artistic 
unity and inner coherence attained through poly- 
phonic mastery, and, above all, the will and 
power to give concrete musical expression to 
large thoughts and unbridled passions, to the 
Rabelais and to the madman both that are latent 
in all of us these are not to be lightly ignored. 
Here precisely it is that Mr. Finck seems not 
quite adequate to his task. He has evidently 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



585 



little genuine love for polyphony as such, for 
the interweaving of independently moving melo- 
dic lines. That the polyphonic technique has 
frequently degenerated into mechanical virtu- 
osity need not be denied. It is doubtful, for all 
that, whether the history of music records any 
means of expression more virile and resourceful 
than the free polyphony of modern music. Mr. 
Finck is also doubtful, it would seem, of the 
legitimateness of such wealth of expression in 
pure tone as Strauss gives us. He may be right, 
but only one prepared to meet Strauss at least 
half way in his artistic presuppositions is gen- 
uinely qualified to interpret him to us. That 
is why Mr. Ernest Newman's far shorter study 
of Strauss seems so much more vital; the few 
pages that Romain Holland devotes to Strauss 
in his "Musiciens d'Aujourdhui" also reveal a 
deeper understanding of the musical personality 
of this composer. 

Underneath all Mr. Finck's hesitations and 
shrinkings in the presence of Strauss's tone poems 
and operas, may we not discern a more funda- 
mental clash of temperaments, the refined irri- 
tation of the cultivated Sybarite who looks on 
at the capers of a healthy barbarian, a spirit at- 
tuned to Tennysonian felicities subjected to the 
uncouth liberties of a Walt Whitman? Some- 
thing of the kind is conveyed by Percy Grainger 
in the following words, taken from his inter- 
esting introductory essay: 

Strauss is not a musician's musician like Bach, 
Mozart, Schubert, Grieg, or Debussy, capable of 
turning out flawless gems of artistic subtlety and per- 
fection, but rather is he a great cosmic soul of the 
Goethe, Milton, Nietzsche, Walt Whitman, Edgar 
Lee Masters caliber: full of dross, but equally full 
of godhead ; lacking refinement, but not the supremer 
attributes ; and uniquely able to roll forth some great 
uplifting message after gigantic preliminaries of 
boredom and inconsequentialness. 

( Do Schubert and Grieg quite belong to the first 
list? Do Goethe and Milton feel quite at ease 
with their neighbors in the second?) It is the 
"dross," the "lack of refinement," and the "gi- 
gantic preliminaries of boredom" that too fatally 
affect Mr. Finck; the "godhead" and "supremer 
attributes" seem altogether lost in the scramble. 
In the section devoted to "Program Music" 
Mr. Finck has a splendid opportunity to analyze 
the psychology and aesthetics and trace the de- 
velopment of one of the most interesting musical 
phenomena of the last hundred years. I cannot 
find that he has made very serious use of the 
opportunity. The externality that characterizes 



his account of Strauss's career and his descrip- 
tion of the musical compositions themselves is in 
evidence in this section as well. The inevitable 
anecdotes, random remarks on various speci- 
mens of programme music (MacDowell's piano- 
forte sketches come in for warm appreciation), 
a determined and gallant attempt to convince us 
that the symphonic poem has reached its artistic 
culmination in Liszt, and divers evidences of 
Strauss's inferiority to his Hungarian precursor 
fill up space that one would have liked to see 
devoted to the rationale of the programme move- 
ment and to the varying ideals that have ani- 
mated its representatives. We are not given even 
a serviceable notion of the nature of Strauss's 
aesthetic procedure, of the manner in which he 
aims to reconcile the conflicting demands of 
literary conception and musical treatment, of 
the symbolic significance of leading motive, 
instrumental individualization, and polyphony. 
And what of the evolution of musical form 
in the compositions of Strauss, the acknowl- 
edged master of form? In brief, we nowhere 
feel that we are being brought to a realization of 
the nuclear conceptions of Strauss the artist. 
How then can the reader justly estimate the 
place to be assigned Richard Strauss in the his- 
tory of programme music, whether his tone poems 
represent a logical and healthy development of 
ideas that owe their most authoritative formula- 
tion to Berlioz and Liszt or, as Mr. Finck would 
have it, mark the degeneration of the programme 
tendency ? 

Be that as it may, there is little doubt that 
for the present programme music has reached 
its apogee. Signs of revolt have been in evi- 
dence for some time; the cumbrous literary con- 
structions that were meant to give form to 
elaborate tonal creations seem to crumble of their 
own weight. It is probable that the program- 
mists have attempted too much, that they have 
tried to get as much service out of Pegasus as 
out of a willing dray-horse. The future alone 
can tell whether they have indeed attempted the 
impossible or have merely sought the arduous 
conquest with means too coarse and untried, 
have mistaken a Rosinante for the real Pegasus. 
Meanwhile, a clear swing back to the absolutists, 
Brahms notwithstanding, is a sheer impossibility. 
However music may tend to be chastened of its 
luxuriance of symbol, the spell of fancy and mood 
that the romanticists and programmists have 
cast over it will not disappear. Self-determina-

tion of form and emotional expression if these 
alone remain, their attainment by way of the 
perhaps circuitous route of the programmists will 
have justified the Liszts and Strausses. 

Yet all the while I find myself seriously dis- 
trusting the psychological validity of the current 
classification of composers into absolutists and 
programmists or impressionists. To an altogether 
unwarrantable extent we have been taking mu- 
sical artists at their own valuation, at the sur- 
face value of their titles and programmatic 
analyses. Is it not possible, nay likely, that an 
appalling proportion of the musical "programmes" 
authorized by composers are afterthoughts de- 
signed, consciously or unconsciously, to lure the 
public, always an essentially unmusical body? 
Or to give an external conceptual frame, of sub- 
jective associative value, to a lyric impulse that 
has already untranslatably expressed itself in 
tone? We know that Schumann gave titles to 
his pieces after he had composed them; the con- 
ceptual label, in other words, was probably more 
a flourish of the pen, a Finis, than a genuine 
aesthetic stimulus. The wayward whimsy or 
burning passion was there from the beginning, 
but it needed no other than purely musical ex- 
pression. May not even some of our impres- 
sionists, Debussy among them, entertain a fun- 
damentally identical attitude toward their ma- 
terial? Is there not the least shade of hypocrisy 
in these pagodas and goldfish and engulfed cathe- 
drals and moons descending on temples that 
were? Strange, otherwise, that we seem to 
breathe a larger air and to feel the tow of a 
mightier current in the music itself than in the 
bric-a-brac world its titles introduce us to. Con- 
versely, there is little reason to doubt that a 
great deal of absolute music, so-called, has been 
wrought out of conceptions and emotions that 
were all but ready to burst into impassioned 
speech. What are some of those curious recita- 
tivo passages in the Beethoven sonatas, glades in 
the wood, but tortured questionings and striv- 
ings bound in musical constraint? Before we 
can profoundly approach the psychology of pro- 
gramme music, there is much underbrush to be 
cleared away. We must know better than we 
do how the artist conceives and works and care 
less how he labels. Perhaps it is well that ar- 
tists tell us little, but we can often guess back 
of their paraphernalia of labels if we will but 
hearken to the music.

Movement

DOLORES OF THE SIERRA AND OTHER ONE ACT 
PLAYS. By Harriet Holmes Hasten. (Paul 
Elder tc Co.; $1.25.) 

The little theatre is not an end in itself, but a 
means to an end. Its influence upon both stage- 
craft and playwriting must be sought not di- 
rectly, but indirectly; and yet its influence is 
greater than any of its accomplishments. What 
the little theatre does counts for less than what 
it prompts others to do. It is as a school for 
future American dramatists that the little-the- 
atre movement has literary significance. 

And there is great need for such a practical 
training-school. It is a truism that the the- 
atrical business puts a premium on experience in 
play-making. The American public is notori- 
ously conservative in its dramatic tastes, and 
play-production in America is very costly. Every 
instinct of the commercial manager shrinks from 
the new dramatist or the play with new dramatic 
ideas. Both have been welcomed by the little 
theatres. This gives a special interest to the 
new American one-act plays. Some of them we 
find are plays of real value ; all of them we must 
search scrupulously for promises of bigger work 
to come. 

Mr. Wilde is one of our most experienced 
makers of short plays. He began to write them 
before there were any little theatres, and he 
has profited more than any other American play- 
wright by little-theatre production of his work. 
Mr. Wilde has had his training, but, as yet, he 
shows no desire to be more than a clever writer 
of timely, well-constructed "one acters," a sort 
of Clyde Fitch of the little theatre. His very 
success is the measure of our disappointment. No 
American dramatist handles clever dialogue and 
tense action more effectively than he does, and 
his insight into character is incomparably keener 
than that of the writers of our Broadway suc- 
cesses. His new volume shows growth in Mr. 
Wilde, especially in his understanding of the 
springs of human emotion. Of the new series the 
title play, a fine and effective use of the legend 
of the angels at the battle of the Marne, is the 



1917]

best, but he almost duplicates the success of 
this difficult piece of work in his German version 
of a similar theme, "Valkyrie." Taken together 
these are the finest dramas the war has inspired 
in America. The three remaining plays are in 
his familiar realistic style, but none are so good 
as "Dawn" or "According to Darwin." "Moth- 
ers of Men" is a fine theme marred by careless 
characterization; the thesis of "those who do 
not understand the war" is overdone in the 
Russian peasants in "Pawns"; "In the Ravine" 
is a capital bit of dramatic journalism, but no 
more. This last is sure to be popular with 
little-theatre producers, but in each of these three 
realistic sketches there is that same ultra-time- 
liness, that Sunday-supplement appeal to to-day's 
interest, that has inspired our seasonal succession 
of crook plays, children's home comedies, and 
trench melodramas. 

Next to their obsession of timeliness our pop- 
ular playwrights have suffered most from mis- 
taking clap-trap for constructive action. The 
strict limitations of the short play force a dram- 
atist to learn technique, and the value of such 
a training is emphasized by the good construction 
of the three one-act plays that were first pro- 
duced by the Washington Square Players. There 
are, however, other promising qualities in these 
plays. "Another Way Out" reveals Lawrence 
Langner as a young man of wit and good sense, 
an adroit writer, a shrewd observer. In this play 
he has achieved the almost-impossible, a shock- 
ingly moral burlesque in English, a play with a 
violently risque situation without any nastiness. 
Mr. Langner has qualifications to make him a 
keen dramatic satirist. "Trifles" is a well-con- 
sidered and finely executed study of the dreary 
life of a farm wife, quite the best thing on this 
distinctively American theme done by an Amer- 
ican dramatist. It shows Susan Glaspell to be 
a careful analyst of feminine character with the 
ability quickly and surely to interpret her studies 
in dramatic form. One cannot doubt that she 
can do a lifelike portrait on a larger can- 
vas. When I saw the Washington Square Play- 
ers in Bosworth Crocker's "The Last Straw," 
I was not convinced that the heckling of the 
neighbors over his accidental killing of a stray 
cat would drive Friedrich Bauer to commit sui- 
side, and a careful reading of the play does not 
remove this impression. Mr. Crocker deliber- 
ately tried to make good his thesis of the force 
of public opinion by means of extremely trivial 



incidents compressed into one short act. He 
only just failed in this ambitious task, but the 
fine courage to come to grips with difficult dra- 
matic problems is not a fault. As in the work of 
the two other Washington Square playwrights, 
there is a promise for the future in his work. 

The promise in the plays of Harriet Holmes 
Haslett is not so clearly spoken. Her people 
are types rather than individuals; her plots are 
more commonplace; her action is too often 
switched by mere chance ; her thought is less ma- 
ture. She has, however, dexterity in dialogue 
and has learned to manipulate stage business. 
A couple of her plays notably "Modern Men- 
age" and "When Love is Blind" should at- 
tract the attention of little-theatre producers. 

These authors, whose one-act plays we have 
been considering, are doing work typical of a 
number of young American playwrights who are 
at school in the little theatres. Ben Hecht, 
Alice Brown, Eugene O'Neil, Philip Moeller, 
Mary MacMillan, Alice Gerstenberg, Edward 
Massey, and Stuart Walker, to name but a few 
that come readily to mind, are all promising 
scholars. Already two have been graduated from 
one-act pieces to long plays that have been pro- 
duced by commercial managers; others are sure 
to follow them. Already and this is significant, 
though till now the plays have come from abroad 
there is an increasing tendency on the part of 
the little theatres themselves to stage long plays. 
These are steps forward, for however important 
the influence of the little theatre, the stage is 
for all the populace, not the intelligentsia alone; 
however perfect the one-act play, great drama 
furnishes a full evening's entertainment.

King Coal 

KING COAL. By Upton Sinclair. (The Mac- 
millan Co.; $1.50.) 

The novel- reader who chances to appreciate 
a really novel design in a work of fiction will 
like "King Coal" both for its originality and its 
independence. A story of the oppressive law- 
lessness of American democracy, the book will 
have, for everyone interested in that great sub- 
ject, the suspense of "a march in the ranks, 
hard-prest, and the road unknown." 

To have made this theme, which is, in the re- 
viewer's opinion, the most important internal 



588 



THE DIAL 



[December 6 



question before our country, the subject of a 
novel, is in itself a first-rate stroke of originality. 
It may be objected that the legitimate field of the 
novel is not the presentation of a great social 
theme, but individual human characterization. 
But if "King Coal" must be said to be almost 
destitute of the faculty of individual human char- 
acterization, it has nevertheless a species of "hu- 
man interest" impossible for any other prose form 
to convey. This interest is the fascination of 
learning from page to page what will happen 
next about the law-breaking oppressions charac- 
terizing the unorganized American coal-mining 
camps which are the scene of the hero's adven- 
tures. What happens to him as an individual is 
comparatively unimportant to you except as it 
affects his achievement for the progress of the 
"sober-suited freedom," the clear ideal of human 
order and liberty, whose presence is the distinc- 
tion of the book. 

The son of a coal magnate, a young college 
graduate, engaged to a standardized magazine- 
fiction debutante, Hal Warner goes to work 
as a miner, "for the experience," on a coal 
property in the Rockies. He wishes to learn for 
himself the truth of what has been said about 
the western coal camps. In his revolt at learn- 
ing authentically of their tyrannies, he proceeds 
from a considerable conservatism, along the trail 
of an unavailing attempt to secure enforcement 
of the law against the anarchies of the coal com- 
pany, until he comes out on the road of union- 
organization. 

On this trail and this road he forms the 
acquaintance of the daughter of a miner, Mary 
Burke, "a Celtic Madonna," less markedly unlife- 
like than the debutante, but not for me exactly 
real. The author tries to persuade us that the 
fact that the hero loves both Mary and Jessie 
(the debutante) is a matter of some importance 
in his career. But I cannot care whether it is 
Mary or Jessie that he prefers, or bring myself to 
believe that this preference is of the least signifi- 
cance either to Hal Warner or to his author, 
scarcely to Jessie or Mary. It is a mere minority 
report brought in to comply with the Rules of 
Order for the conduct of novels. Interesting 
and stirring as an active committee man, as one 
bewildered in a dual love, Hal Warner is of a 
dreadful dreariness. You long to hurry him on 
his way through his mechanical and argumenta- 
tive love scenes, and off to the more subtly under- 
stood and impassioned concerns of his excellent 
committee meetings. 



But in spite of the strange unlifelikeness of 
Mary and Jessie, and of all the wealthy sur- 
rounding her, there is in the description of the 
hero's adventures of sentiment with women an 
individual tone of frankness and decency, an 
adult and responsible tone, which is both socially 
superior and independent. In his sympathetic 
and sincere pictures of workmen's families, ren- 
dered with no "intimist" talent, but with an 
excellent solid grasp of economic and industrial 
fortunes, Mr. Sinclair excels. The Italian 
Minettis, the Raffertys, the Burkes, the Welsh 
Davids, the rank and file of the hero's mining- 
town acquaintance, are all admirably identified, 
without dialectic exaggerations, all real and 
interesting. 

The mine disaster is a wonderful and moving 
panorama ; and the whole tale of Hal's attempts 
to strike some spark of justice from the con- 
stituted authorities is capital. When some of 
the more conservative of our envoys returned 
from Russia the other day, and told us that 
there had been less violence in the whole course 
of the Russian Revolution than we experience in 
this country in a single week, they brought 
home to us a much-needed truth concerning our 
barbarity. The most signal achievement of 
"King Coal" is the impression it leaves of our 
wretched social irresponsibility, our American 
cowardice in facing gross disorders and human 
cruelties inside our own nation. 

What is to be done about our gross dis- 
orders and human cruelties then? The mortal 
fortunes of the book end in a vista, with 
the hero's advance down a discouraging and 
apparently endless road, which still leads ahead. 
This open ending appears to me significantly true 
to nature and history. 

The philosophy of the book, however, seems to 
end in the postscript, with a predetermined sign- 
post in the form of a statement that "citizens 
and workers . . . will find that they have neither 
peace nor freedom, until they have abolished the 
system of production for profit." Maybe this 
abolition will bring peace and freedom. But its 
interpolation here appears sudden, illogical, and 
unrelated. As though we had been told that all 
these difficulties we have read about would be 
removed if we would encourage the acquisition of 
land for public playgrounds, or would work for 
single tax, or were advised to find general direc- 
tions for the advance of all civilization on any 
other good, sound plank removed from any other 
excellent social platform.

To a mere middle-class believer in our almost 
untried and varied experiment in democracy this 
socialistic statement closes over the book's horizon 
with the effect of a limitation, remote but dark- 
ening. It may serve to indicate what is indeed 
for me the limitation of the book its tendency to 
predetermination, its lack of curiosity and 
interest in keen ascertainments and differentia- 
tions, its apparent belief in formulas. Thus one 
early perceives that the poor of the volume are 
predestined to possess extraordinary mental and 
moral superiorities; and those of better financial 
fortunes, a striking mental and moral flaccidity. 
As in the theory of Ernest Pontifex in "The 
Way of All Flesh," "the poor are all, lovely." 
Scarcely any of the low-minded are to be dis- 
cerned among them; and among those below a 
certain grade of income violence is virtually un- 
known or always restrained. On the other hand, 
with the exception of Hal, all the citizens above 
a certain grade of income are presented with 
anatomies and human natural histories no more 
convincing than those of the millionaires in 
clothes covered with dollar signs in the cartoons. 
The employers present a solid front of low- 
mindedness and bullying brainlessness. Just as 
to the narrow Edward all miners are agitators, 
and as in Zola's consoling and agreeable 
"L'CEuvre," such artists as are not realists or 
impressionists are boldly represented as physically 
ill-favored or degenerate, so the entire army of 
employers appearing in "King Coal" is composed 
of the frivolous, the dishonest, and the murder- 
ous. While the scope of the book is specifically 
limited to the unorganized field, yet, by inference, 
the coal-operators who have kept organization 
pacts at heavy financial sacrifices for a generation, 
and all employers, indeed, are lumped together 
in one indistinguishable mass with those who 
have stuffed ballot-boxes and entrained machine- 
guns against their compatriots. The author's 
socialism would have been more persuasive if his 
characters had been conceived somewhat more in 
the spirit of granting them equal opportunities. 

If, as George Meredith tells us, "the soul's 
one road is forwards," it must appear that all 
exaggeration of class prejudices against the light 
of truth is but a darkening and a delaying on the 
way. Yet when this is said, the novel remains 
an interesting and valuable record of the adven- 
ture of a soul on that forward road of justice 
which leads around the world and into a future 
unknown. FRANKLIN WYATT . 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS 

AT THE FRONT IN A FLIVVER. By Wil- 
liam Yorke Stevenson. Houghton Mifflin; 

$1.25. 

WITH CAVALRY IN THE GREAT WAR. 

By Frederick Coleman. Jacobs; $1.50. 

How TO LIVE AT THE FRONT. By Hector 

MacQuarrie. Lippincott; $1.25. 

The war books that are flooding in upon us 
should, in one respect, give hope to the peace- 
lovers who are almost ready to despair of the 
world's regeneration; for they shatter the great 
illusion that to live in the midst of hardship 
and horror, with death constantly at one's 
shoulder, necessarily does things to one's soul. 
"Men come out of it changed," the idealists say. 
But, as a matter of fact, nine-tenths of the men 
who go into battle, as nine-tenths of the war 
books bear witness, are men of normal, not over- 
refined sensibilities, who, on the surface at least, 
accept war and its horrors as all in the day's 
work, and will come home, if they are fortunate, 
to take up their tasks where they left off, ap- 
parently in the same manner as before. Only 
those born with the capacity for profound spirit- 
ual reactions get profound spiritual reactions out 
of war. Many grow and many are stunted ; but 
only a few reach the heights and depths. And 
that, perhaps, is lucky. 

All of which is by way of saying that the 
reader need look for nothing more or less than 
journalistic reports of occurrences in "At the 
Front in a Flivver" and "With Cavalry in the 
Great War." The former book, a diary kept 
for the writer's family, is the more freshly writ- 
ten of the two. The most interesting features of 
the latter are its explanations of the causes of 
events that are now history. Though neither 
book can be classed with the best popular writ- 
ings on the war Guy Empey's famous volume 
and the writings of Captain Beith and James 
Norman Hall they have, of course, as almost 
all war books have, a documental value for the 
reader who is interested in life "over there." 

The purpose of "How to Live at the Front," 
as its title indicates, is different from that of 
most war books. The volume is intended for 
the information, not of those who are to stay 
at home, but for those who are going into the 
trenches. It should prove to be of genuine value 
to nine out of ten of the men who are serving 
with our Expeditionary Forces in France. Writ- 
ten without pretension, it is reminiscent of the

inconveniences of trench life, the signs by which 
the growing curse of Europe, the prostitute, may 
be recognized and avoided, a man's own war- 
troubled soul. It is not a book that goes to the 
roots of things, or tries to. It is just a healthy- 
minded, simple, religious man's wholesome reac- 
tion to the by-products of war. As such, it is

THE DWELLING HOUSES OF CHARLESTON, 
SOUTH CAROLINA. By Alice R. Hugher 
Smith and D. E. Hugher Smith. Lippin- 
cott; $6. 

Any work is important which essays to pre- 
serve a record historical, descriptive, graphic, 
photographic of our fast vanishing Colonial 
architecture, for that architecture constitutes the 
only unified and dignified manifestation of the 
building impulse which our young civilization 
has to show. 

In this sense, at least, the "Dwelling Houses 
of Charleston" is important, for it presents, in 
sufficient fulness of detail, a phase of the Georg- 
ian mode translated to our shores with interest- 
ing variations developed from the social and 
climatic conditions of the little old proud south- 
ern capital by the sea. The book has evidently 
been compiled with care, it contains drawings 
and documents of great interest, yet somehow it 
conveys a sense of opportunities unfulfilled, of 
curiosities unrewarded. This is because it is not 
so intelligent and authoritative architecturally as 
it is historically. 

However valuable it may be to the student of 
Colonial history, however treasured it may become 
to the First Families of Charleston, it offers 
scant fare to one interested in our architectural 
beginnings. No critical estimate, no discrimi- 
nating valuation, no tracing of development, has 
been attempted : one is left to glean what one can 
from a few measured drawings, a somewhat 
larger number of photographic half-tones, and a 
superabundance of rather messy pencil sketches 
which are quite worthless from any other stand- 
point than the vaguely picturesque. 

Here, one feels, is a great deal of good archi- 
tectural material indifferently presented. Aside 
from the seven pages of drawings of ironwork, 
which are indeed precious, and a few mantels 
and stairways, the book contains little to entitle 
it to a place on the shelves of a purely architec- 
tural library. 

The southern Colonial work follows its Eng- 
lish prototypes more slavishly in the matter of 
detail than does that of New England. There 
is little of the freedom, lightness, grace, which 
makes the entrances of old Salem so attractive, 



conveying the sense that these builders bettered 
their instruction as was indeed the case. On 
the other hand, the southern mansions exhibit, in 
general, a finer sense of composition and mass. 
Their amplitude and solidity, their cool, high 
porticoes, their many and massive chimneys, 
contribute to an effect of large means, abundant 
leisure, and rich, ripe social life, compared with 
which the Puritanism of New England, as 
expressed in even her best houses, seems some- 
what hard and cold and thin. 

The particular features of the Charleston 
houses which differentiate them most, and call 
for special comment, are their two-storied porti- 
coes a difficult thing to treat, as every architect 
knows, and here superbly handled ; their garden 
walls and fences pierced by truly noble gates, of 
a highly localized type; and their iron balconies, 
which savor more of Latin than of Anglo-Saxon 
origin, yet have a certain note of primness quite 
different from the loose luxuriance of Mexico 
and Spain. 

The vicissitudes of civil war and the ebbing 
tide of commerce have contributed to isolate and 
preserve in these old houses a record of that 
moment in our past which expresses itself in 
beauty. Since then the idea of power has obsessed 
us, and it has written itself in ugliness over all 
the land. Is it too much to hope that after the 
world has been made safe for democracy, we may 
set ourselves the task of translating power into 
beauty? Every record, like this one, of the old 
urbanity, will then possess an interest and a value 
far greater than any interest or value we can 
assign to it to-day. 

THE SUPERNATURAL IN MODERN ENG- 
LISH FICTION. By Dorothy Scarborough. 
Putnam ; $2. 

If industry is a virtue, the author of "The 
Supernatural in Modern English Fiction" should 
find a ready welcome to the "best families" in 
the society of heaven. Dr. Scarborough, if a 
cursory counting of her index is any estimate of 
her reading in preparing this book, has no less 
than 1200 titles to her credit. Everything from 
Hamlet to O. Henry, from Walpole's "The Castle 
of Otranto" to Patience Worth's literature via 
the ouija board, from the sublimity of Macbeth's 
tragic situation to the ridiculousness of Frank 
Stockton's "The Transferred Ghost" has been 
read, summarized, card-indexed, and then strung 
together. Page after page of condensed ghost- 
plot is spread before the awed and stupefied 
reader. There is no comment to speak of, no 
relieving humor, only plots, plots, plots of ghost 
stories. The volume might act as a guide to a 
class of light (or heavy?) literature: look up 
the plot of any ghost story written in the last

150 years (and a few before), decide whether 
or not you'd like the tale, and so choose your 
story. 

Dr. Scarborough seems to be the victim of an 
idee fixe; she must have devoted years and years 
to taking notes on every phase of the supernat- 
ural in fiction. Ghosts are classified under every 
conceivable category. There are ghosts that wear 
clothes, and, though few, there are ghosts that 
have been known to appear nude; there are dis- 
membered ghosts, crippled ghosts, and mutilated 
ghosts; there are ghosts that carry their heads 
in their hands, and ghosts which, like certain 
people, lose their heads. Ghosts are as a rule 
well behaved and, until recently, serious and 
grave. They are however in contemporary lit- 
erature beginning to be frivolous and inclined 
to superficiality. Dr. Scarborough has attempted 
to deal at least by way of mention with every 
ghost manifestation in literature, and her volume 
is testimony to her sense of thoroughness. If any 
proof of the supernatural in literature is needed, 
it is found in the amount of reading and cata- 
loguing she herself has done. It must be a relief 
to have the thing off her mind, but the reviewer 
cannot quash a feeling of pity for the hypo- 
thetical reader who will not have the relief of 
writing a review of the book. 

THE FUTURE OF CONSTANTINOPLE. By 
Leonard S. Woolf. Macmillan; $1. 

"Constantinople and the narrow straits upon 
which it stands," says Mr. Woolf, "have occa- 
sioned the world more trouble, have cost human- 
ity more in blood and suffering during the last 
five hundred years, than any other single spot 
upon the earth. . . It is not improbable that 
when Europe in her last ditch has fought the last 
battle of the Great War, we shall find that what 
we have again been fighting about is really Con- 
stantinople." In his little book Mr. Woolf 
makes analysis of the reasons why the Turkish 
capital has been so productive of international 
unrest, and brings forward interesting proposals 
looking to the removal of these causes. His main 
contention is that, having vainly sought for three 
or four hundred years to solve the eastern ques- 
tion through arrangements which leave Constan- 
tinople under the domination of a single state, 
to be used by that state exclusively in its own 
interests, the world should take advantage of the 
forthcoming reorganization of Europe to follow 
out the suggestion of Sir Edward Pears and oth- 
ers that the city, the straits, and a narrow strip 
of territory on either side of them be internation- 
alized. 

This would mean the removal of the Turkish 
capital to Asiatic soil and the setting up in the 
vacated city of an international organ of govern- 



ment charged with the maintenance of law and 
order and the administration of such rules for 
times of both peace and war as the nations might 
prescribe. A good precedent is found in the inter- 
nationalization of the Danube under the treaty 
of 1856, and it is urged that by the proposed 
arrangement no nation would lose any vital and 
legitimate interest. The governing commission 
should be wholly disinterested, and might very 
well consist of three members one from Den- 
mark, one from Switzerland, and one from the 
United States chosen by the signatory powers 
from lists of five nominated by these several 
nations. Mr. Woolf feels that the finality of 
the present war will depend in no small degree 
on the decision concerning Constantinople. If 
this strategic spot is neutralized, every nation will 
be protected from aggression ; if left in the hands 
of any single state, half of the world must always 
be in fear of aggression. There is much to bear 
out this contention; although one cannot repress 
the feeling that the author undervalues the diffi- 
culty of carrying out his plan. 

JAPAN DAY BY DAY. By Edward S. 
Morse. 2 vols. Houghton Mifflin; $8. 

The country life of the Japanese people as it 
was, and still is to-day in many localities un- 
spoiled by town and factory, is recorded in Jap- 
anesque sketches and running text in Professor 
Morse's latest and most extensive work on the 
Land of the Rising Sun. The author was pro- 
fessor of zoology in the New Imperial Univer- 
sity of Tokyo during a very interesting period 
in the early years of the transformation of Japan 
and witnessed some of the throes of the struggle 
of occidental and oriental ideals from the van- 
tage-point of a government official, with an out- 
look from the capital city. It was, however, 
the daily life of the people, their quaint and 
curious and clever ways and devices, so differ- 
ent from our own, and their social customs and 
industrial methods which most interested him. 
Above all, the life of the country, the town, the 
fisherman's village, and the contacts with the 
rural population along footpath and mountain 
trail attract him more than the court or the 
places of trade. In the course of his scientific 
explorations at the seaside and among the an- 
cient shell mounds, the author had exceptional 
opportunities to learn at first hand the thou- 
sand-and-one little customs of these ever-interest- 
ing and courteous people. The book is a narra- 
tive abstracted from a daily journal. It is full 
of digressions into matters of arts and crafts, 
industry, agriculture, home and social customs, 
the sights and sounds of the road and of the 
crowded street, everything in fact from an earth- 
quake and a picturesque Japanese fire to street

signs and festivals, the rearing of crickets, and 
the training of birds. The numerous sketches 
which are distributed throughout the book are 
crude but reveal with great fidelity familiar and 
characteristic Japanese scenes and many a quaint 
or pleasing glimpse of Japanese life and artistry. 

A COUNTRY CHILD. By Grant Shower- 
man. Century; $1.75. 

Never have the sights and sounds, the tastes 
and smells and tactile sensations of the farm been 
more realistically presented than in this book. 
Like "A Country Chronicle," which preceded it, 
this story is told in the first person and repro- 
duces in the vividest of colors certain scenes and 
incidents of the author's boyhood. Professor 
Showerman is the son of a Wisconsin farmer 
who was one of the pioneer settlers in the Badger 
State; but he has chosen literature rather than 
agriculture as a calling, probably enjoying the 
rude farm life better in the imaginative retro- 
spect than he would in the present reality. At 
any rate, he makes it enjoyable to his readers. 
Here is a bit of homely realism (the men have 
just come in to dinner from the field) : "My 
father goes to the sink and washes. The others 
stand near the geraniums until he gets through, 
and then they wash, too. They take water out 
of the rain-water pail with the dipper, and when 
they are through they go to the woodshed door 
with the wash dish and throw the water out. 
Christian makes a great noise blowing and snuf- 
fing when he is at the sink." Everything is told 
in the "historical present," and in the short sen- 
tences and breathless style of a small boy eager 
to pour out his information to the first listener. 
Whether in real life he would always have re- 
lated these momentous happenings in the present 
tense is doubtful; but then, in real life he never 
could have written them out with such an artful 
imitation of artlessness; so we yield at the start 
the whole question of strict verisimilitude. A 
score or more of line drawings by Mr. George 
Wright catch in a happy manner the spirit of the 
narrative. 

OLD SEAPORT TOWNS OF THE SOUTH. By 
Mildred Cram. With drawings by Allan 
C. Cram. Dodd, Mead ; $2.50. 

For three years the American traveller has been 
shut out of the play places of Europe, unless he 
wishes to drive an ambulance or engage in some 
form of relief work. Those who still wish to 
travel must find new lands, and in consequence 
America is being discovered by its own people. 
The experiences and discoveries of one pair of 
explorers brother and sister are here related 
in sprightly detail, and the account is dressed by 
the publishers in the best product of the printing 



press. It was a case of seeing the South in six 
weeks or less time, but our travellers managed 
to "take in" fourteen towns of the South At- 
lantic seaboard and the Gulf Coast, beginning 
with Baltimore and stopping at Galveston. What 
they found and saw we knew about before, but 
it is always interesting to observe the reactions 
of others when they are introduced to a new and 
strange environment. In the Florida towns and 
in New Orleans Miss Cram really saw some- 
thing that most travellers miss that the foreign 
element is largely Greek in Florida, and Italian 
and Spanish, not predominantly French, in New 
Orleans. Of all the towns visited she is com- 
pletely satisfied only with Charleston, Mobile, 
and New Orleans, and with the unprogressive 
characteristics of these. She makes it plain that 
the winter is not the best time to see the South, 
for then it is at its grayest. But who wants to 
go there when the thermometer is above ninety? 
The historical facts woven into the narrative are 
at times somewhat mixed; but the book, as a 
whole, though unsubstantial and inconsequential, 
is an interesting and honest account of a new 
experience, and that is all that can be expected 
of such publications. 

A HISTORY OF THE GREAT WAR. Vol. II. 
The British Campaign in France and Flan- 
ders, 1915. By Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, 
Doran; $2. 

This is an important book. It bears evidence 
of much research and has an authoritative tone. 
So far as is possible at this stage, it is real his- 
tory. The author has been at pains to study 
out the records of the British units in the san- 
guinary fighting of that terrible period which 
has been well named the "year of equilibrium." 
The book includes the first detailed description of 
the second battle of Ypres and the great battle of 
Loos. Sir Arthur is a true Briton. He distrib- 
utes his praise generously among English, Cana- 
dians, and Anzacs. He sets the crown on 
regiment after regiment and makes many a refer- 
ence to the heroic acts of individual officers and 
men. At the same time the power of the enemy 
is not minimized. Throughout the volume one 
can feel the force and skill of the German units, 
to which the author gives full credit. 

The effect of the book, in spite of its judicial 
tone, is depressing. The task of the British 
army in this year seems insuperable as the author 
unfolds history, and the huge losses, though not 
described in a gruesome manner, leave the reader 
with visions of carnage that he cannot forget. 
Even the superhuman bravery of British civilian 
troops as they charge in the face of a fire meas- 
uring six shells to their one, cannot down that 
terrible image of slaughter. Such a work will be 



1917] 



THE DIAL

read with more interest in England than in 
America. The evolutions of the Durham Light 
Infantry and the First Royal Irish will naturally 
appeal more to those who know them than to us 
who do not. But the book as a whole leaves a 
powerful impression hardly to be obtained from 
any other work thus far published. The style is 
easy and clear, the movement well sustained, and 
there are many stirring descriptions of desperate 
deeds and unfaltering courage. 

INTERIORA RERUM, or The Inside of 
Things. By Quivis. Lane; $1.25. 
These meditations, "de omnibus rebus ct qui- 
busdam aliis," as one might almost characterize 
them, have to do with certain less familiar aspects 
of earth and sky, heaven and hell, man and 
woman, religion and philosophy, literature and 
art, and almost everything else imaginable. They 
are, in short, delightfully discursive and also 
thoughtful and penetrating, with a pith and 
brevity that never fail to save from weariness 
and often leave a desire for more. Here, as a 
sample, is a pertinent and seasonable reflection: 
"It is a standing marvel to men what women 
will endure, and apparently can endure with 
impunity, at the dictates of fashion. They will 
wear clothes in cold weather which would cause 
the death of a man similarly clad." Woman, 
with her demonstrated constitution of iron, rep- 
resents no weaker sex to this author. His little 
book, of whose authorship we know only that it 
is written by "whomsoever you will," and dealing 
as it does with "the inside of things," or "subjects 
which, as a rule, we refrain from discussing," has 
piquancy and suggestiveness. 

EARLY PHILADELPHIA. By H. M. Lip- 

pincott. Lippincott; $6. 

This is a beautiful piece of book-making. The 
edition is limited and the type already distrib- 
uted ; hence, if one desires a copy, no time must 
be lost in making application to the publishers. 
From the quality of the paper, the character of 
the printing, and the superb illustrations, it may 
be guessed that the price will be high. Now, 
what of the book itself? 

There have been other histories of Philadel- 
phia, notably Scharf's valuable work published 
in 1884, and the leading men of the city have 
figured in our national biography from the be- 
ginning. But this book endeavors to name and 
describe all the leading characters and the various 
social, financial, and patriotic organizations, 
giving portraits and reproductions of people and 
places, buildings and bridges and parks, in such 
a way as to offend none and please all, at least 
all whose names and interests are included. It 
is a sort of book of heraldry for all the sub- 



stantial and socially fit of the present day. If 
you are a Philadelphian and have ancestors who 
counted in the city of Franklin, this book will 
give you name, business, and standing. 

Of course, such a work cannot be critical. 
The founders of the Bank of North America, of 
the first insurance company, of the university, 
were all engaged in work that produced good 
results and perhaps some bad results as well. 
But there is no word of explanation why, for 
example, the legislature of Pennsylvania can- 
celled the charter of the great bank or why all 
the directors then set themselves the task of get- 
ting a new federal government and a charter 
from that government under which they could 
continue their business. Nor is it stated that 
nearly all the influential bankers got into the 
federal convention and there favored, and secured 
the adoption of, constitutional clauses which 
would protect charters and contracts against 
mere state intervention. But, as has been said, 
this sort of explanation was not a part of the 
author's purpose and consequently some excel- 
lent opportunities have been overlooked. 

FOUR ESSAYS. By Murray Anthony Potter. 
Harvard University Press; $1.25. 

There are two distinctly different, and per- 
haps opposed, reactions possible to these essays 
of Mr. Potter's: that of the scholar, and that 
of the layman. The scholar will, no doubt, be 
interested in Mr. Potter's knowledge of the the- 
ories concerning Petrarch's life the existence 
or non-existence of a flesh and blood Laura, the 
interpretation of the sonnets and other works as 
autobiographical or not ; and he will be still more 
interested in Mr. Potter's attitude toward these 
problems and his conclusions. The layman will 
wish to get from the essays a living knowledge 
of Petrarch the author, Petrarch the man, and 
Petrarch the critic and reader. 

To the layman it would seem that both may 
be comfortably satisfied; the essays are suffi- 
ciently bristly with scholars' names, their hypoth- 
eses, and their controversies, to suggest that 
no one but a Dryasdust will be disappointed. 
And the layman finds Petrarch living and ap- 
pealing in spite of the foreign matter. Petrarch 
turns out to have been a human being and not 
an excuse for a Ph. D. thesis. He was egotisti- 
cal, but he was so much like the average man 
as to be ludicrously conceited; he had no more 
idea of the relative merit and value of his various 
works, as expressions of the human soul, than 
have a great many of his well-meaning students. 
He loved and hated madly, and the fact that 
he never considered the sonnets to Laura as a 
passport to immortality is the strongest proof 
of their autobiographical importance. He wrote 



594 



THE DIAL 



[December 6 



intensely personal, self-satisfied letters to inti- 
mate friends; he often thought he knew it all; 
and he disliked having to acknowledge that he 
was wrong. But, and here his greatness glows 
through, he would do so if the evidence was 
convincing. It appears that he was jealous of 
Dante, and that he thought the latter pandered 
to public taste, contrived for fame, writing 
poetry in the vernacular! Altogether Mr. Pot- 
ter's essays, the outcome of a life's study, breathe 
a contemporaneousness satisfying to the uniniti- 
ated. 

BALFOUR, VIVIANI AND JOFFRE. Edited 
by Francis W. Halsey. Funk & Wagnalls; 
$1.50. 

"You have kept your ancient traditions; your 
past glory is ever present in your hearts, you 
have love, and affection, and admiration for 
civilization and humanity. You have an idealism 
which floats above your flag, and that idealism 
you place above your material interests" these 
words, spoken by M. Viviani in New York, 
might serve as an epitome of the book, "Balfour, 
Viviani and Joffre." Mr. Halsey's collection of 
the speeches of the commissioners is a useful work 
of reference rather than a readable book, for one 
must grant that the average of eloquence, despite 
the frequent "lift" in M. Viviani's addresses, is 
low, while the passages that are insignificant and 
that duplicate one another are very numerous 
indeed. Possibly the main reason for the rela- 
tive mediocrity of these speeches is the nature of 
the task confronting the commissioners. So much 
at least is certain: they were not here to make 
memorable orations. The editor has linked the 
speeches with narrative and descriptive comment 
drawn chiefly from the newspapers of the day 
and reproducing the hectic exuberance of the 
daily press comment not without its value when 
one considers how fast the contemporary news- 
papers decay physically. 

RICHARD CUMBERLAND: His LIFE AND 
DRAMATIC WORKS. By Stanley Thomas 
Williams. Yale University Press; $3. 

The activities of Richard Cumberland were 
many. He was at one time private secretary to 
Lord Halifax ; at another time he was entrusted, 
with disastrous results to himself, with an ambas- 
sadorship to Spain; and sooner or later he tried 
his hand at nearly all kinds of writing. He 
wrote essays, an epic poem, novels imitative of 
Fielding, numerous plays, and a volume of 
memoirs which, though intended only as a pot- 
boiler, has become his best-known work. The 
plays gave him his chief contemporary fame. 
They are of varied types. He early struck his 
right vein, the sentimental comedy; virtue in dis- 



tress transformed by a theatrical coup into virtue 
triumphant was exactly to his liking. More- 
over, as a grandson of Richard Bentley, a Cam- 
bridge graduate, and a man of social standing, 
he brought to the composition of this kind of 
drama certain qualities which Hugh Kelly and 
other rivals lacked. Of these qualities the power 
to write well-bred and graceful dialogue \vas 
foremost. But the feverish ambition of Cum- 
berland drove him to undertake operas, adapta- 
tions, tragedies, and what not, and sometimes to 
filch from other writers. And just as he frit- 
tered away his strength in hopeless undertakings, 
so did he by his exacting temperament alienate 
people who had been useful to him. He was in 
some ways really noble, yet querulous, sensitive, 
irritable, vain. He quarreled openly or was seri- 
ously at outs with Garrick, Sheridan, Fanny 
Burney, Walpole, and nearly everybody else. 
Sheridan pilloried him in "The Critic," as Sir 
Fretful Plagiary. With Boswell, Burke, John- 
son, and Romney, however, he remained on good 
terms. Though reduced to poverty and disap- 
pointment, he lived well into the nineteenth cen- 
tury and became a friend of Samuel Rogers. Just 
before the dawn of the century, his powers in 
sentimental comedy revived, and "The Jew" and 
"The Wheel of Fortune" of this period fairly 
matched "The West Indian" at the beginning of 
the seventies. Dr. Williams has done his work 
thoroughly and given us a useful volume. 

BRITAIN IN ARMS (L'Effort Britannique). 
By Jules Destree. With a preface by 
Georges Clemen<;eau. Translated by J. 
Lewis May. Lane; $1.50. 

In 1915, when Italy was wavering between 
war and continued neutrality, the Belgian jour- 
nalist Jules Destree visited the kingdom, 
explained with new force the position which his 
own country occupied in the struggle, and 
wielded strong influence in behalf of the event- 
ual declaration of hostilities. Finding later that 
the great effort which England was making wa< 
imperfectly understood south of the Alps, he 
wrote a book in Italian, telling something of that 
effort. The work was shortly brought out in 
French, and now it appears in English, under the 
less colorful title, "Britain in Anns." The book, 
by the author's confession, was hurriedly written ; 
it is propagandist; but its laudable object is to 
fortify international confidence as "a preparation 
for the better days to come" ; and it makes inspir- 
ing reading. 

In his opening chapter M. Destree tells, from 
the documents, the now familiar story of Great 
Britain's labors for peace during the "Twelve 
Days," and shows that the country, despite its 
utter lack of preparation, was compelled to take

up arms not only by deep considerations of honor, 
but in defence of vital interests. The nation's 
effort is then described under three main heads: 
naval, military, and financial. Naval effort is 
discussed in such a manner as to show mainly 
two things the tremendous effect of the bot- 
tling up of the German fleet and the reasons 
why the British fleet does not force the latter to 
fight by invading the harbors and waters in which 
it lies hiding. 

The evolution of the "contemptible little 
army," through the anxious days of the volun- 
teer system and of the installation of conscrip- 
tion, into the splendid fighting forces of Sir 
Douglas Haig, is forcefully related. And the 
country's financial expedients and sacrifices are 
adequately sketched. A final chapter emphasizes, 
with copious citations of incident and quotations 
from statesmen of the day, Britain's benevolent 
purposes in the war and her determination to 
prosecute the struggle to a successful end. The 
country is not likely to move quickly enough to 
suit Gallic impatience. She seems painfully slow 
to understand a situation and to make up her 
mind. But for these very reasons, when her 
mind is once made up, her steadfastness can be 
relied upon as can that of few other nations. 
"We may make mistakes," says Lloyd George, 
"but we do not give in." In the knowledge of 
this fact, concludes M. Destree, France and Italy 
and their co-belligerents may, and do, find deep 
consolation in their darkest hours. 

THE POEMS OF EDGAR ALLAN POE. Ed- 
ited by Killis Campbell. Ginn; $1.50. 
One need not accept all Professor Camp- 
bell's judgments in detail to pronounce this new 
edition of the "Poems" the most important con- 
tribution to Poe scholarship that has appeared 
for some years. Perhaps the greatest merit of 
the book is its sobriety and sanity a trait that 
will be best appreciated by those who have had 
most to do with other discussions of Poe. The 
editor has made wise use of his predecessors, to 
whom he punctiliously acknowledges his indebt- 
edness, but he has adopted none of their preju- 
dices and pet theories, and more strangely he 
seems to have few pet theories of his own. The 
brief sketch of Poe's life is as nearly free from 
a priori assumptions and as nearly judicial as a 
biography of Poe well can be. In the section of 
"The Canon of Poe's Poems" Professor Camp- 
bell treats a subject on which he has made valu- 
able researches; and his brief comments on the 
poems doubtfully attributed to Poe are admir- 
able. Other sections of the introduction that 
are of especial value are those on "Poe's Pas- 
sion for Revising His Text" and "Poe's In- 



debtedness to Other Poets." The former contains 
acute comments on the merits and demerits of 
many of the changes, and the reasons that in- 
duced Poe to make them. The resume of opin- 
ion in "The Clash of the Critics with Respect to 
Poe's Poems," though brief, is excellently pre- 
sented. In the body of the book the variorum 
forms of the text are placed at the bottom of 
each page, and are more conveniently arranged 
than in Harrison's Virginia edition. They also 
include a few readings unknown to Harrison, 
among them those of the "Richmond Examiner" 
proof sheets. The notes, like the introduction, 
are sensible, terse, and inclusive. The appendix 
contains collations of the editions of the poems 
published in the author's lifetime, and his pref- 
aces and prefatory notices. The frontispiece, a 
reproduction of a cut from "Graham's Maga- 
zine" based on a painting by A. C. Smith, is 
interesting, but is hardly the portrait to choose 
if but one is to be given. 

THE OLD WORLD THROUGH OLD EYES. 
Three Years in Oriental Lands. By Mary 
S. Ware. Putnam; $2. 

It is for the entertainment of her grandchil- 
dren, Mrs. Ware tells us, that she has collected 
and published her travel letters covering the three 
years from August, 1912 to July, 1915, and 
every cent of profit from the sale of the book 
is to go to French hospitals during the war and 
to blinded French soldiers afterward, should 
there be any profits accruing when the war closes. 
A courageous and independent tourist, despite 
her years, Mrs. Ware went around the world 
unaccompanied, visiting Honolulu, Japan, China, 
Siam, Sumatra, Java, the Philippines, India, and 
other eastern lands. She returned by way of 
Italy and France, and of course has much to say 
about the war in her later letters. A chance re- 
mark from a German fellow-traveller eighteen 
months before the fatal August, 1914, is sig- 
nificant in the light of subsequent events. "The 
gentleman said the Kaiser believed himself Em- 
peror by divine right, was a romanticist in 
politics, and he, the speaker, was afraid the 
country would go to ruin under this intolerable 
regime." Not confining herself to the usual 
themes of travel narratives, the writer shows an 
interest in colonization problems and the govern- 
ment of primitive peoples by the more advanced 
nations. Four native courts of India received 
her as a guest, and she had interviews with vari- 
ous rulers and chieftains. She is evidently a 
woman of strong character and trained intellect 
as well as large heart, and her book has more of 
character and individuality than would be found 
in most collections of family letters from abroad.

THE UNITED STATES POST OFFICE. Its 
Past Record, Present Condition, and Po- 
tential Relation to the New World Era. 
By Daniel C. Roper. Funk & Wagnalls; 
$1.50. 

Mr. Roper, who writes with the authority of 
four years' experience as first assistant postmaster 
general (1913-16), opens his introduction with 
the assertion that "the mightiest implement of 
human democracy is postal service" just as a 
writer on universal suffrage might, naturally 
enough, begin with declaring the mightiest imple- 
ment of human democracy to be the ballot, or a 
writer on education might plausibly maintain this 
mightiest implement to be the public-school sys- 
tem. What the mightiest implement of animal 
democracy or of vegetable democracy is, we are 
not told by Mr. Roper. His enthusiasm for his 
subject promises a good book, and the promise is 
fulfilled. Especially interesting are the chapters 
on the workings of the various departments of 
our postal service, as also the account of certain 
significant differences between our own system 
and those of Europe. A chapter entitled "Postal 
Perspective" presents a suggestive vista of pos- 
sible future developments in our post-office de- 
partment. Mr. Roper believes that "the parcel 
post undoubtedly has already had some effect on 
the cost of living," by bringing farm produce 
more directly to the table, "and is destined to 
exercise more." But the hoped-for results in 
this particular have by no means been realized, 
and are not yet in sight. 

INTRODUCTION TO SOCIOLOGY. By Emory 
S. Bogardus. University of Southern Cali- 
fornia Press; $1.50. 

To understand society is to know the factors 
which bring people together in human associa- 
tion. Such is the underlying idea of this latest 
contribution to social analysis. Professor Bo- 
gardus, however, is not content merely with a 
static view of the social world. Desiring to 
know under what conditions we can promote 
social progress, he presents the fundamentals of 
sociology from the standpoint of the various in- 
fluences in particular the geographic, biological, 
hygienic, recreational, economic, political, aes- 
thetic, intellectual, ethical, and associational fac- 
tors operating upon man in his collective life. 
In many respects this viewpoint reflects the 
teachings of Professor Small. The advantage of 
Professor Bogardus's method is that it brings to 
bear in a simple, elementary way a great mass 
of pertinent facts regarding the community as- 
pects of health, recreation, industry, the home, 
the state, and man's various other social-contact 
interests, which must be understood if one is to 
live intelligently in his world. 



NOTES ox NEW FICTION 



This second novel of "Henry Handel Rich- 
ardson," "The Fortunes of Richard Mahoney" 
(Holt; $1.50), has been so warmly admired that 
one is surprised to find it so much a mere work- 
manlike, conventional effort, with an aggressively 
mid-Victorian hero. What are we to think of this 
young Irish medical student, turned adventurer 
and shopkeeper in the Australian gold fields, 
to whom crises bring "the difficulty of recon- 
ciling the divine benevolence with a cruel deed, 
the falling back once more on the trite admis- 
sion of man's impotence"? Or who asks ques- 
tions like these, "Was it straining a point to 
see in the whole affair the workings of a Power 
outside himself?" How are we to enjoy a hero 
who, in contemplating a beautiful young mother 
and child, thinks, "No place this for the scoffer! 
Were they not in the presence of one of life's 
sublimest mysteries that of motherhood!" and 
on thrilling at the idea of "little Polly as the 
mother of his children" decides that after all 
"there was a design in creation"? So Tenny- 
sonian a young man is a little difficult to assimi- 
late to-day, particularly when we are given such 
gestures as his admiration for "the splendid vital- 
ity of the most popular cleric in the diocese of 
Victoria. No sickbed was too remote for him 
to reach, no sinner sunk too low to be helped 
to his feet." 

Yes, "Henry Handel Richardson," who is said 
to have written a remarkable novel about the 
German music-student world, actually says such 
things about Richard Mahoney. Moreover, 
bored with his storekeeping in crude Ballarat, 
the hero marries as pure and virtuous and inno- 
cent and docile a maiden as ever charmed a mid- 
Victorian reader. To her "his lightest wish was 
a command," and their lives are arranged by him 
according to the divine plan of masculine 
supremacy. He says to her things like this, 
"I trust my little woman will never put such 
a ridiculous object on her head," with reference 
to a flouncy hat with which a neighboring vulgar 
female had falsely adorned herself. When a 
light-headed protege makes love to Polly, Richard 
has all the correct and outraged reactions of the 
man of property. When he begins to find life 
stagnant in Australia and thinks of setting out 
uncharted to begin life again at home, it is the 
Deity and not at all Polly whom he consults. 

As a picture of the commonplace colonialism 
of the fatuously masterful young Englishman, 
who veils his egoism in noble emotions and 
religious cant, the book would be fairly signifi- 
cant. As a satire, in historical perspective, on the 
pedestrian soul of the mid-Victorian young gentle- 
man, it would be fairly amusing. But its author 
is not satirical. She endows Richard Mahoney

with no qualities above middle-class mediocrity, 
and then treats him rather lovingly and seriously. 
There are in the book admirable descriptions of 
the rough pioneer life. But the naive middle- 
class saturation of her own attitude, without 
irony or lift, keeps the book as a whole distinctly 
below the level of literary art. 

There seems to be a kind of tempo or rhythm- 
of -the- whole in books, just as there is, more dis- 
tinctly, in plays and music. Sometimes the tempo 
synchronizes very nicely with the mental pulse 
of the reader sometimes it syncopates. This 
reader, at least, and Arthur Sherburne Hardy's 
"No. 13 Rue du Bon Diable" (Houghton Mif- 
flin; $1.35) form an admirable example of syn- 
chronization. The reader felt no desire to race 
ahead of the book, nor did the book incline to 
pass the reader on the track. Which is saying 
much for a detective story. 

Mr. Hardy's detective story is unusual in 
many ways. There are actually human char- 
acters in it, and a swiftly woven texture of mo- 
tives, and charming bits of color, local and 
otherwise; a love story that is not sentimental; 
and most unusual of all, a murder committed be- 
fore our very eyes so that we know from the 
beginning who the murderer is, and are able to 
follow with appreciation, and no less intensity 
of interest, the work of a French detective whose 
success is based on neither luck nor cocaine nor 
marvelous scientific machinery. 

A display of knowledge on matters typo- 
graphic is a vanity peculiar, let us hope, to a 
strictly past generation of reviewers, but it is 
not out of place to state that in the make-up of 
the present volume there is displayed a feeling 
for the quality of the text that is seldom found 
in any but the more expensive books. The type, 
binding, preliminary pages, even the margins 
and running heads, are characteristic of the better 
class of French novels, and American novels of 
twenty years ago. 

There is perhaps no one in spirit land who 
would find so cordial a hearing as Mark Twain, 
if he were to send a message back to us. But 
the Mark Twain of "Jap Herron," the novel 
written from the ouija board (Mitchell Kenner- 
ley; $1.50), is not the real Mark Twain. He 
is a pitiful shade, yearning ineffectually toward 
a lost earth. If one accepts the book as his, it 
discredits both his memory and the future life. 
If one doesn't, the presumably sincere ladies who 
operated the ouija board are cast under a shadow. 
There is, indeed, just enough circumstantial evi- 
dence to arouse the horrible suspicion that per- 
haps Mark Twain did come back to write the 
book. There are Mark Twain mannerisms in 
"Jap Herron"; there is an occasional glint of 
what might be called Mark Twain humor ; there 



is a hero who is an emasculate echo of Tom Saw- 
yer and "Huck" Finn. But one need not take 
the revelations of the ouija board at their face 
value. By seeking an explanation of the way 
in which the book came into being in the sub- 
conscious rather than the superconscious, one 
avoids making any charges of duplicity, the mem- 
ory of "our" Mark Twain is left unspotted, and 
"Jap Herron" is transformed from a maudlin 
imitation into a study in psychology. 

In "Conquest" (Dodd, Mead; $1.40) Olive 
Wadsley utilizes much of a previously employed 
plot. She substitutes a Paris street gamin for 
the London waif-heroine, moving him from 
Paris to London instead of vice versa, and other- 
wise reverses scenes, situations, and characters of 
her "Possession" in a rather obvious fashion. 
The corresponding figures in the two books 
progress along parallel routes to equidistant ter- 
mini, and the journeys make very pleasant read- 
ing. There are good bits of characterization in 
"Conquest," and an authentic air of sophistica- 
tion and interest regarding prize-fights and 
sporting-events surprising in the work of a 
woman author even a British one. 

What we call "good taste" is the most un- 
justly belittled of the virtues. We speak of it 
usually as of a superficial attribute, when, as a 
matter of fact, it is probably as potent at the 
roots of things as any other moral force. It is 
not exaggeration to say that the French con- 
ception of what constitutes good taste might have 
saved the Germans from committing many 
atrocities in war and in peace, just as it might 
save many of our lesser novelists from utter 
banality. On the basis of this one book, "The 
Man Who Killed" (Brentano; $1.50), Claude 
Farrere must be classed among the lesser novel- 
ists, but he must be classed, none the less, as a 
writer of some ditinction. The tale he tells is 
a rather fantastic and melodramatic story of 
modern Constantinople that might easily have 
become garish in less skilful hands. But M. 
Farrere has what so many of our contemporary 
writers lack intellectual sophistication and good 
taste. Dramatic reserve, intelligent characteriza- 
tion, and an exotic background, painted with 
beauty and understanding, make a strange tale 
plausible and worth the reading. 

"The Optimist," by Susan Taber (Duffield; 
$1.30), is the title of the first of a group of gen- 
uine short stories. The author has remarkable 
ability in setting forth the meaningful episodes 
in her characters' lives. In her economical use 
of material, too, she is skilful, giving in consid- 
erably less than the usual space illuminating 
glimpses into the past and clever characteriza- 
tions besides. For instance, the Optimist explains 
to her vagabond husband that she is an optimist

because, after the suffering she has endured 
through him, anything is tolerable a new way 
of arriving at a philosophical attitude. Many 
of the stories are brightened by humor and all are 
fresh. 

Mary Roberts Rinehart has adopted the 
pseudo-historical form in writing her latest novel, 
"Long Live the King" (Houghton Mifflin; 
$1.50). It is staged in two European countries 
and deals lightly with the problems of monarchy 
versus revolutionary democracy, while telling the 
story of a young crown prince to whom an Amer- 
ican scenic railway and the companionship of 
the proprietor's small son appealed more than 
his own proper business of being taught how to 
govern. The author has never failed to construct 
a plausible, well-built tale, but she has put no 
more significance into this than into her previous 
work. It is amusing enough in contents and 
more than American in style. 

In "A Castle to Let," by Mrs. Baillie Rey- 
nolds (Doran; $1.35), the ingredients are Tran- 
sylvania, which Mrs. Thurlow thinks is one of 
the United States ; an old castle with numberless 
secret passages and one locked door as enticing 
as the one in Blue Beard; susceptible princes; 
one lost heir, in the guise of a servant; one 
smoking dragon; and an English heiress who 
rents the castle and thus acquires mysteries with- 
out end. It is a book, that is to say, entirely of 
incident a thriller for the movie-minded. 

The good detective story is never out of style, 
but "The Dream Doctor," by Arthur B. Reeve 
(Harper; $1.35), and "The London Nights of 
Belsize," by Vernon Rendall (Lane; $1.40), are 
even better than good, for they are different. 
The detective-story enthusiast probably knows 
that Craig Kennedy, Arthur B. Reeve's hero, in- 
variably finds the solution of every mystery by 
means of his scientific apparatus: telephones with 
power to reproduce more than the voice, cam- 
eras with certain new powers, and machines to 
detect the criminal. The mechanical devices 
would be useless, however, without Kennedy's 
shrewd detective instincts. Very different are 
the methods of Belsize, rich and eccentric, find- 
ing adventure in London. His only aids to un- 
raveling mysteries are various Chinese axioms, 
such as "Patience and a mulberry leaf will make 
a silk gown." A good part of the tales is persi- 
flage, indicated amply by titles like "Feeding the 
Makers of Statistics" or "The Lost Scholar." 
In one entitled "Belsize as a Commentator: 
Sherlock Holmes," the amateur detective casts 
aspersions on Holmes's knowledge of Thucydides 
and of Greek. In short he intimates that the 
whole was a puzzle devised by Watson to keep 
the famous detective amused. 



CASUAL COMMENT 

NOON, OCTOBER 31, 1917 marked 400 years 
since Martin Luther nailed on the door of the 
Schlosskirche at Wittenberg his twenty-five Latin 
theses, from which the Protestant Reformation 
is conveniently dated. For the sectaries who 
think this act liberated them from intolerable 
shackles the man who did it cannot help acquir- 
ing the heroic, semi-divine attributes which the 
mythus-making mechanism generates everywhere, 
upon Napoleon and Washington and Lincoln, no 
less than upon Paul and Augustine and Luther. 
In sharp contrast with the inflation worked auto- 
matically among the sectaries is the bearishness 
of Catholic writers on the Reformation. The 
latter cannot help regarding him as a stubborn, 
rebellious priest, ignorant, bumptious, dogmatic, 
and in sharp need of discipline. A disinterested 
estimate, such as a person might make who had 
no stake in the quarrel between Protestantism 
and Catholicism, does not exist. Protestant 
estimates, moreover, exhibit a sharper partisan- 
ship than Catholic, because they are infected by 
the superlatives of German Wissenschajt, which 
has been moved by national vanity to start its 
modern national Pantheon with Luther. To the 
Germans Luther is a German first and a Chris- 
tian and a thinker afterward, and being German 
is de facto supreme. And for the rest of the 
Protestant world the forty-year-old habit of tak- 
ing Germans at their own scholarly valuation is 
hard to break. Yet an educated Chinaman or 
Hindu, looking upon Luther and his work with 
a sympathetic but disinterested eye, would find 
him on the whole a man of rather cheap mind 
and no great dignity of character. He would 
find the Reformation, so far as Luther was in- 
volved in it, determined far more by dynastic 
and military considerations than religious ones. 
He would find Luther uttering in his own life 
and policy all that the modern mind finds most 
intolerable in Catholicism. Between that and 
Lutheranism he would find no intellectual, only 
a political, difference a decision of the issue 
between Guelph and Ghibelline in favor of the 
secular authority. He would see the really 
religious reformation of Catholicism among the 
followers of Calvin and Zwingli, and surveying 
the two centuries which followed Luther's act, 
he might readily wonder whether that dance to 
death was worth the fiddler's price. For what 
Catholics are apt to regard as Luther's pig- 
headedness galvanized into new life a moribund 
system whose dogmas and symbols were fast be- 
coming merely a hieroglyph and language for 
any ideas a man might choose to entertain. Mm 
within the church, even the successor of Peter 
himself, were free-thinking, secularizing powers,

little concerned about salvation in a next world, 
and much about the art of life in this. Author- 
ity was giving way to tolerance, theology to 
humanism. If the church was corrupt, it was 
also urbane, and the corruption showed itself 
moreover as the soil of a healthy secular freedom. 
Luther's rather trivial theses were the starting- 
points of a series of events which made dogma 
once more momentous. They generated a coun- 
ter-reformation against reformation, Jesuitism 
against Puritanism. And for this, which our 
Chinese or Hindu historian would recognize as 
the outcome of an avoidable initial accident, 
mankind has paid a terrible price in treasure, 
life, happiness, and freedom. It may be that 
the Providence that shapes our ends so shapes 
them that nothing worth winning can be other- 
wise won. 



figure became infinitely flexible. But this was 
an enervation of the artistic effect, because a 
violation of an inherently inflexible material. 
It was taking the backbone out of sculpture. 
Yet Rodin was steadily pushing beyond the 
boundaries of marble into the realm of color- 
suggestion, from the plastic to the pictorial, with 
a growing impatience of the resistance of his 
medium. Pencil and water-color were his escape 
from it. It is in his drawings that Rodin more 
completely reveals his intimate approach to form 
in movement. For the fluidity of line and wash 
permitted of his instantaneous tracing of the 
inner reflection of the parade of moving structure 
as it passed before him. They possess conse- 
quently all the magic of the spontaneous, and 
that perfect justification of the means in the 
end which his over-refined statuary lacks. 



ONLY TO THOSE UPON WHOM HE EXERTED a 
personal influence can the death of Rodin have 
meant much. For to most of them the vigorous 
and kindly personality was as great a need as 
their own adulation. To many of them his 
guidance and inspiration must have been of 
genuine positive value. But though he was 
changing to the last, he will be remembered and 
reckoned by works long since completed, in their 
way already classic. In fact, his death has 
eliminated all extra-artistic bias from the ap- 
praisal of his work. His eloquence, his unction, 
his oracular pronouncements about art will for 
a long time prejudice the judges of his work, 
but to the rest of the cultivated world he will 
be an artist of amazing originality, fluid and 
abundant, thoughtful without profundity, ro- 
mantic without passion. He is most profound 
and passionate when under the spell of Michel- 
angelo. The mention of this influence needs no 
apology, for though it is a historical common- 
place, it is far more fundamental than is com- 
monly supposed. Ever since the turbulent public 
appearance of the Bronze Age, in 1877, Rodin 
manifested that whether his plastic conceptions 
ultimately derived from specific works of Michel- 
angelo or not, he was haunted by his movement. 
What he learned from the Louvre Slaves, the 
St. Matthew, the Medici Chapel in Florence, 
the Jeremiah in Rome, carried him beyond these 
in the same direction. It was a type of move- 
ment which began with the great master and 
which had in his hands become a mode of ex- 
pressing the will and the instincts in blind, 
weltering labor and strife, while the physiog- 
nomy was to remain at least in highly respect- 
able art the agent of more mechanical, 
knowable, superficial psychology. Rodin's ex- 
ploitation of symbolic movement led him to relax 
the laws of twisting and bending until the 



CERTAIN EDITORS OF POPULAR MAGAZINES 
have decided tentatively at least that a short 
story to be commercially acceptable need not 
be 8000 words, or even 6000 words, in length. 
It may be 2000, presumably, or even 1500, and 
still escape being negligible. Emphatically, this 
is a step in the right direction. It disposes of 
at least one sort of standardization, and that by 
no means the least annoying to the serious work- 
man who thinks of his subject as bearing some 
definite relation to its development. Will the 
mere shortening of fiction automatically improve 
its quality? Only indirectly, probably, though 
the omission of banal chatter put in to extend the 
areas "next to reading matter," will be at least 
a negative gain. Stevenson, to be sure, used to 
argue with great eloquence that he could pro- 
duce masterpieces with a pruning-knif e ; but he 
was only thoughtlessly reflecting the traditional 
French superstition, and confessing that he was 
never embarrassed by any exuberance of the cre- 
ative imagination. Masterpieces, alas, are not 
to be had so cheaply. They are produced not by 
leaving things out, but by putting the right 
things in. The short stories of Mr. Conrad are 
long, but they are never too long; they are just 
long enough to contain all that he has found 
it worth while to say about his theme. Neither 
are the short stories of O. Henry too short. His 
emotions exhausted themselves rapidly because 
they were obvious emotions and easily shared. 
He understood his talent perfectly, and it was 
not simple laziness that led him to do his trick 
with the swiftness of a juggler and ring down 
the curtain on a smile or a sigh. Such a gift 
as his cannot adjust itself readily to the require- 
ments of 8000 words, and to maintain such a 
standard places a serious handicap on men whose 
work is done in the spirit of the artist.

CHRISTMAS LUST OF SELECTED JUVENILE 
L.ITERATUKE 

Many of the sensations and conceptions of child- 
hood reach far into the future to motivate the re- 
actions and attitudes of middle age. The memory 
of the first book echoes sensitively in the mind after 
a lifetime of hardier experience. It is an earnest 
of the pervasive influence of the original images, now 
generating ceaselessly, though invisibly, in the deep 
subconscious; and some psychologist may hereafter 
point to a disquisition on the ramifications of the 
first "Mother Goose." 

Whether it is better that children should imbibe 
fairy-tale conceptions of life or better that they 
should imbibe the truth about things as they are, 
however unlovely some things as they are may be, 
depends, of course, on whether that early innocent 
faith in the beauty and goodness of the world 
engendered by pretty fairy tales and other candied 
fiction, hinders or helps adjustment to the world as 
it is, hinders or helps the movement to make the 
world what it ought to be. For ourself, we should 
place Anatole France's "Girls and Boys" in the 
hands of every child; for he tells his stories with a 
heart for the truth of life and a pity that some 
things should be true forces both for life as it 
ought to be. Disillusionment at twenty has loosed 
more misanthropy on the world than can ever be 
laid at the door of bitter fact from the cradle up.

children, THE DIAL presents herewith a selective list,

SALT OF THE 
EARTH 

By MRS. ALFRED SIDGWICK 
Author of "Home Life in Germany, " etc. 

THE author of this book know* and under- 
stands Germany Its custom*. iU people, 
through and through. She has the gift of 
interpretation. Her characters are living flwh 
and blood. They are made real to us, and their 
very touki are bared. 

Here we learn just what that thing is against 
which we are fighting. Here we learn just why 
we are sending our men to the trenches. As we 
read we are stirred to a new passion of seal 
in this battle for the triumph of right over 
wrong. 

The writer reveals to us the heart of Germany, 
lovable in some aspects, but chiefly sinister, hide- 
ous, a threat to the world. As we read we get un- 
der the skin of the military caste that lusts to 
dominate the whole world. 

But the truth taught by this novel is not its 
only merit. It is a story full of charm from 
the first word to the last. There are bits of 
realism that give the reader a new appreciation 
of war's hatfulness. Yet. at the end, there 
is happiness for those who have grown strong 
through suffering. 

It is a novel of entertainment that thrills and 
satisfies. It leaves a memory of the sort that 
makes for patriotism.

The first important New York book sale of the 
season was held by the American Art Association 
on November 19 and 20. There were three ses- 
sions and 761 lots. The grand total was $10,760.50. 
Of all the items the most interesting perhaps was 
"The Isle of Pines," by Henry Neville, printed 
at Cambridge, Massachusetts, by Samuel Green 
the elder, in 1668. It was an unrecorded issue of 
one of the "lost books" of the colonial press in the 
college buildings at Cambridge. It was the White 
Kennett copy, with his autograph signature on the 
title, and was in Bishop Kennett's library, disposed 
of in London on July 30, 1917. After the death 
of Mathew Day in 1649, Green was appointed to 
take charge of the printing-office of the college 
press. He became prominent both in civil and 
military affairs of the colony. His name is the 
most famous of all the early printers in New 
England, his service as manager of the college 
press extending over forty years. "The Isle of 
Pines" is a romance after the manner of Swift and 
Defoe. It was quite popular in its day and passed 
through several editions. It was knocked down 
to Mr. Blanchfield for $410. 

The rare first edition of "The American Physi- 
tian," by W. Hughes, London, 1672, went to Mr. 
Furman for $40. The wax portrait of George 
Washington done from life by Joseph Wright, and 
from which he made the plaster cast which he sent 
to his mother, Patience Wright, as a model for 
her famous wax-relief portrait of Washington, was 
bought on order for $520. A stipple portrait of 
Washington, drawn by R. Peale, engraved by D. 
Edwin, and published by J. Savage in 1800, was 
bought by Frederick W. Morris for $95. A stipple 
portrait of John Adams, published by E. Savage 
in 1800, sold for $75, and a stipple portrait of 
Thomas Jefferson, drawn by R. Peale, engraved bv 
D. Edwin, and published by J. Savage in 1800, 
went for $65. "The American Querist," by Myles 
Cooper, New York, printed by James Rivington. 
1774, the extremely rare second issue, was ob- 
tained by Mr. Morris for $60.

Faith" 

By HARRY EMERSON FOSDICK 
An "Everyday Life" Book 

Thin Paper, Art Leather Cloth, i nn 
Round Corners, Pocket Size, ipJ..UU 



IS THE BOOK that Fosdick 
has been working on for years, and 
turned aside long enough to write "The 
Challenge of the Present Crisis." 

The author's purpose in these twelve studies 
is to clear away the misapprehensions involved 
in the commonly accepted theories of faith, to 
indicate the relationship of faith to other aspects 
of life, to face frankly the serious question of 
suffering as an obstacle of faith, and to expound 
the vital significance of faith in Jesus Christ.

THE ELLESMERE CHAUCER 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

As a subscriber to THE DIAL, I write to ask 
you if you can tell me in whose possession the 
Ellesmere "Chaucer" now is, and the address of 
the owner. Perhaps you may also happen to know 
whether the illuminations of the pilgrims in that 
MS. have been recently reproduced in any sales 
catalogue or descriptive article. I should greatly 
appreciate the information. 

R. S. LOOMIS. 

Urbana, Illinois, November 18, 1917. 

The Ellesmere Chaucer was in the Bridgewater 
library owned by Lord Ellesmere, which was pur- 
chased in London by George D. Smith. This 
famous manuscript is now owned by Henry E. 
Huntington, whose residence is at Fifth Avenue 
and Fifty-Seventh Street, New York. In the 
Bridgewater Catalogue, we are informed, there 
was printed an illumination from this manuscript. 
The catalogue is now in Mr. Huntington's pos- 
session. The features of the library are dealt 
with in John Payne Collier's "Early English Lit- 
erature in the Bridgewater Library." ED. 

THE LETTERS OF JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
I am preparing for publication in the near future 
the letters of James Whitcomb Riley. I shall be

me or send the letters to me. All letters will be 
carefully returned as soon as they have been copied.

is illustrated throughout 

by the author. Here is

When there's nobody

In the top of your dome, 
Then your head's not a 

head; it's a nut!

"Children's and Household Tales." George 
Cruikshank illustrated the first English edition, 
published in 1823. 

According to a little French paper, published 
in a cellar in Montmartre, Samuel Hopkins Adams, 
author of "Our Square and the People in It," has 
become a firm. The French paper speaks of a 
series of articles "publics dans la Tribune par 
MM. Samuel, Hopkins et Adams," and an Ameri- 
can friend recently asked Mr. Adams how the 
three gentlemen therein contained were. 

"The Road of Ambition" (Britton) is the latest 
achievement of a girl whose own road of ambition 
has been exceptionally straight. Miss Elaine Sterne 
had her first story published when she was fifteen 
in "St. Nicholas." Before she was twenty, she had 
won a number of prizes for short stories, one of a 
thousand dollars from "Collier's Weekly." She 
has written thirty or more plays for the moving- 
picture world, and now a novel, which is soon to 
be dramatized. 

Have you a friend who is proud of his ancestral 
home in Philadelphia, or Charleston, or some old 
town of Virginia? He will be pleased with one 
of those books on the social history of colonial 
America, an attractive series, which Lippincotts 
are putting out: "Early Philadelphia: Its People 
and Customs," by Horace Mather Lippincott; 
"The Dwelling Houses of Charleston, South Caro- 
lina," by Alice R. and D. E. Huger Smith; and 
Mary Newton Stanard's "Colonial Virginia." 

A few sentences from William Maxwell's "If I 
Were Twenty-One" (Lippincott) are an earnest 
of the value of the whole for a boy who is 
say half way through high school, before it is too 
late to plan a career: "The biggest truth I have 
ever discovered in connection with job-hunting and 
job-finding is that the possession of more than 
average knowledge or more than average skill con- 
stitutes the only force, outside the degrading thing 
called 'influence' that will lift one above the sordid 
and commonplace struggle for jobs by the 'help 
wanted' route." "I have observed that the man 
with ten per cent 'right' and one hundred per cent 
'go ahead' usually gets farther along than the man 
with one hundred per cent 'right' and ten per 
cent 'go ahead.' " This last was the principle, we 
are told, that made William Maxwell the vice- 
president of one of the largest corporations in the 
world.

large dignity and majestic march of some of the 

nobler sonnets of the past.

of distinction and quality. He has great pictorial 

power, and at times a sweep and spaciousness that 

remind one of an elder and larger day. He is a poets'

Heredla with his sonnets.

The E,ditor 

is a weekly magazine for writers 

It is twenty-two yean old. Those who conduct it 
like to think of it as a weekly visitor to ambitious 
writen. as a visitor who must not be pretentious, 
not dull, but friendly and helpful. Recognising that 
writing may be an art, or a trade, or a profession 
what the writer himself makes it THE EDITOR 
tries to tell writen, so far as such things may be 
taught, how to write stories, articles, venes and 
plays, etc. One thing it does, in a way that never 
has been equalled, is to bring to the attention of 
writen news of all the opportunities to sell their 
work. News of current prize competitions is a 
weekly feature. Editorials on copyright and authors' 
literary property rights are frequent. 

P. C. Macfarlane says that THE EDITOR'S lead- 
ing articles, which usually are written by Charles 
Leonard Moore, are the best essays on writing being 
published today. 

THE EDITOR has a department devoted to let- 
ten in which successful contemporary writers tell 
of the genesis, development and writing of certain 
of their published stories. 

A yearly subscription (52 weekly numbers) costs 
$8.00. A four months' trial subscription costs $1.00. 
Single copies are 10 cts. each.

LITTLE SCHOOLMATE SERIES 

Edited by Florence Converse 

A charming series of books, which aims to bring about a better under- 
standing of the life and character of the people of other nations. But, al- 
though intended primarily for children, their elders usually find the books quite 
as interesting as do the young people, because of the interesting and accurate 
pictures they present of life in other lands and because of the skill with which 
the stories are told. 

THE LATEST ISSUE IN THE "LITTLE SCHOOLMATE SERIES" 

THE VILLAGE SHIELD. A Story of Mexico. 

By Ruth Gaines and Georgia Willis Read. Net, $1.50 

With an Introduction by Florence Converse 

Real adventures of two young people, a boy and a girl, pure blooded Indians, descendants 
of the Aztecs. From their beautiful little village, serene and peaceful, it is their fate to witness and 
partake of poverty, oppression and civil war, but through it all their devotion to each other and the 
friendship bestowed upon them by a great and rich man and his wife and by a big-hearted padre, 
are things which make for happiness and remembrance. The illustrations are of especial value and 
interest, both historical and artistic, as the full page pictures are taken from several famous books 
of travel in Mexico while the tail pieces and line drawings have been re-drawn from the beau- 
tiful picture-writings of the Indians.

Letters 

Arranged With Comment 

By Albert Billow Paine 

For more than ten 
years Albert Bigelow 
Paine, the biographer 
of Mark Twain, has 
been at work gather- 
ing these wonderful 
letters which the great 
humorist wrote to his 
friends in every part 
of the world. The 
result is probably the 
most important, cer- 
tainly the most fas- 
cinating, book of the 
year. 

"They abound in 
whim, in humorous 
exaggeration, in 
imagination, and in 
energy. They are de- 
lightful reading in 
themselves in the first 
place, and in the sec- 
ond as revelations of 
the character and the 
characteristics of Mr. 
Samuel L. Clemens, 
who was in some 
ways a different per- 
son from Mr. Mark 
Twain, known to all 
the world." Brander 
Matthews in The N. 
Y. Times. 

"They are full of 
humor and wit, and 
the kindly affectionate 
spirit of the man 
shines on every page.

The Innocents

"The choicest piece of literary art

fect fidelity to life in the portraiture 
of 'Darby and Joan' ; the April blend-

Rodin 



To the Frenchman of to-day Rodin has 
already become a legend. He was one of 
the artists of the last century the greater 
part of whose life was a protest against 
the stubborn conventionalism of his time. 
Culture had become manifold and con- 
fused and every artist of originality had 
to interpret himself through commentaries 
written round his work, or to approve him- 
self through friends, to a public whose con- 
cern was with the conservation of tradi- 
tion in the midst of swift-dissolving 
changes. The artist's success depended 
upon his eloquence as an apologist, and 
Rodin was the type of artist-rhetorician 
whose words were set down by his disciples 
with the glowing ardor of a Gospel. The 
patient and somewhat pathetic protest of 
his genuine gifts against the Institute and 
the Academies threw the glamour of vic- 
torious martyrdom over him, and the ami- 
able and rude distinctions of his person- 
ality afforded much swinging of censers to 
unemployed and adventurous enthusiasms. 
Titian had his Dolce, Michelangelo his 
Condivi and Vasari, but Rodin had his 
Mirbeaux, his Mauclairs, his Brownells, 
his Kahns, his Cladels, and a galaxy of 
other devotees whose books are monu- 
ments to indiscriminate and sometimes 
heroic championship. They are, with few 
exceptions, of no critical value whatever, 
and concern themselves largely with 
biographical details and conversational 
expansions (which occurred with odd fre- 
quency) of the master on artistic matters. 
But the knowledge of an artist's life or 
his views, as of his wardrobe, is utterly 
impertinent to the rendering of fair judg- 
ment about his work. The only thing that 
can really matter about him is not what 
he thinks, still less what he says about his 
art, but only what he achieves within the 
possibilities and the despotic limitations of 
his material. 

But Rodin's thought was irrepressibly 



fluid and abundant, and overflowed the 
bronze and the marble. That is why it 
drifted into studio-talk, and through his 
acolytes into books. The appeal of his 
sculpture is largely in this "overflow," in 
the immaterial extensions of the visible 
object, in its inextricably poetic content, 
and in those evasive characters which the 
medium evades but which lurk in the 
shadow, in the line, and in the delicately 
modulated surfaces. 

For Rodin, as for all serious art, sculp- 
ture began with the human form, and with 
the nude as its essential and most signifi- 
cant manifestation. But the nude held 
for him also certain adventitious and con- 
ventional "over-meanings" which tended 
towards an ecstatic eroticism. He brought 
it within poignant range of our aesthetic 
sensibilities by a kind of refined natural- 
ism. In fact, he got to know the model 
so intimately that he came at last to regard 
his work as a continuation of outer appear- 
ance as it passed through his mind and 
out of it. 

But it was necessary to be naturalistic 
in order to make the nude as ductile and 
variable in its expression as feeling itself. 
He threw himself upon it and tormented 
it into cowering servility. It became a 
medium for the expression of the soul in 
ecstatic stillness in the dreaming Caryatid 
of the Luxembourg, and of the soul 
in ecstatic passion in the female figure 
of "L'Invocation," whose outcry almost 
rends the spotless marble. The rest of his 
work groups itself about one or the other 
of these two works. He passed in the 
course of his development from what is 
organic and fundamental in form towards 
increased suggestion. Had he continued 
on the path he struck in the marvelous 
cadence and firm structure of "L'Homme 
qui marche," and in the movement of the 
strained waking body of "L'Age d'airain,"

he would have been the greatest sculptor 
since Michelangelo. 

But he abandoned the organic male 
structure for the artistically less significant 
female figure, because of its richness of 
sensuous and sensual suggestion. The 
controlling passion seems to be greater 
fluidity at all costs. He came to luxuriate 
in intricate groups of interfluent figures. 
We see them extravagantly tumbled 
together, rolling, writhing doubled upon 
each other, or in the free boundless move- 
ment of flight. 

To secure emotional expression Rodin 
availed himself of every kind of move- 
ment both of muscle and structure, of body 
and feature. Yet movement was with him 
predominantly symbolic; not concerted or 
controlled, but pushed out from within 
without rational intervention. Symbolism 
was a habit of mind with Rodin, and he is 
full of yet another kind profounder and 
more deliberate the symbolism of form 
growing out of the stubborn stone, and 
regarded perhaps in its ultimate sugges- 
tion as the type and culmination of cosmic 
evolution, part of that dumb process that 
pushes all living things up towards the 
earth's surface. 

As his ideas develop his groups become 
richer in arrangement. But the effect of 
bodily action is relieved by abstract move- 
ment. The planes flow over modulated 
surfaces from light to shadow attended by 
the flight of line, and our imagination 
gathering impetus at every moment flows 
and flies with them. And while plane 
and line sweep our vision into the depth of 
a group, they tempt us to walk round it. 
Rodin by inducing the spectator to do this 
definitely extended the effect of sculpture; 
for though sculpture had been plunfacial 
ever since the Greeks, never before had it 
been approachable from so many different 
points. Each one reveals a fresh view 
and each view flows into another, like the 
progressive stages of a symphony. The 
effect is orchestral, and like music, Rodin's 
art is essentially evocative, not topical, and 
works upon us through its moods rather 
than through its subject. The form 
was thus far become an infinitely subtle 
medium, capable of response to all nuances 
of feeling and of emotion. But to the 



form as instrument of expression, he- 
added the superficial qualities of texture 
and temperature. The figure ceases to be 
a plastic abstraction and becomes vital. 
The material, now turned to flesh, is quick, 
fiery, and vibrant, and so exquisitely sen- 
sitive are the surfaces that they would 
seem smoothed and modulated for percep- 
tions much finer than our own. These 
sensuous refinements, proper rather to 
painting than to sculpture, while commu- 
nicating a direct element of life to the 
stone, bring with them an elaborate sys- 
tem of color and chiaroscuro. In places 
the material has been left unwrought to 
extend (especially in marble) the range of 
textural contrasts immeasurably and to 
carry the effect of color values as far as 
possible. Here the purely. sensuous effects 
of touch of which I spoke fuse with the 
immaterial play of caressing light and 
shade and the sense of the medium sinks 
definitely in a manifold of adventitious and 
delightful refinements. 

The peculiar aesthetic of Rodin's over- 
refined and overestimated work derives 
from secondary qualities of art, not from 
monumentality but from daintiness, not 
from organic movement but from mobil- 
ity, not from sense-filling mass but from 
sensibility. Its ideal is not, as in the great 
arts of the past, perfect coherence; it 
embodies rather the cult of the exquisite. 
Nor is the substance of his work, however 
winning it may be, profound and exalted. 
At its centre lies the overpowering mys- 
tery of sex, and his frail, ecstatic figures 
of youth are a sort of efflorescence of the 
sexual principle. The motif is traceable, 
whatever the professed subject, to a capri- 
cious and poetic eroticism which gently 
agonizes the instincts with fruitless yearn- 
ings. Yet Rodin's deficiencies are French 
and traditional. Though we find in his 
work none of the architectural qualities of 
the greatest sculpture the upward thrust 
of life within the downward thrust of mat- 
ter; though he attenuated his superficial ef- 
fects to a point of immaterial refinement; 
though his theme is not conventionally 
noble, now and again his creations carry 
us out of the fever into a world of pure

Idealism in the New French Theatre 



Several years ago the present writer, in 
revolt against our commercial theatre, its 
degradation of the drama and the art of 
the actor, printed, by way of protest, a 
little analogy. Suppose, the question was 
put, that a symphony orchestra were sub- 
jected to the same disintegrating forces 
as the theatrical company of to-day, that 
the first violin were a "star," with all the 
other members of the orchestra (includ- 
ing the conductor) subordinated, not even 
to his instrument, but to the exploitation of 
his or her fascinating personality. Or 
suppose that the orchestra, in the interests 
of commerce, were obliged to play, all 
over the country, a single composition 
(and that an inferior one) throughout an 
entire season. What, then, would become 
of the orchestra, the individual players, 
and music? Reversing the analogy, sup- 
pose that a company of actors were unified, 
like an orchestra, with each dramatic 
instrument subordinate to the whole, and 
under the leadership of a powerful, sincere 
directing intelligence, playing the master- 
works of drama precisely as the symphony 
orchestra performs the music of the world. 
What, then, would be the result? It is this 
question which Jacques Copeau and the 
company of players from the Theatre du 
Vieux Colombier, of Paris, have estab- 
lished themselves in New York to answer ; 
for above all other radical dramatic re- 
formers, they have taken such an organi- 
zation as their ideal. Their special 
mission to this country is to present French 
drama, classic, romantic, and modern ; but 
their original intention, before the war, 
had no nationalistic limitations. It was 
to present drama, native and foreign, 
ancient and modern, in the service of art. 

The Theatre du Vieux Colombier takes 
its interesting name from the old street in 
the Latin Quarter on which it was located 
"the street of the old pigeon-house." 
The little theatre was not an isolated 
undertaking, but an outgrowth from the 
most remarkable literary movement in 
France during the decade before the war, 
a movement which culminated in "La 
Nouvelle Revue Franchise." Jacques 



Copeau was its editor-in-chief. Among 
the contributors were such widely differ- 
ent and intensely modern writers as Emil 
Verhaeren, Paul Claudel, Andre Gide, 
and the Comtesse de Noailles. The pre- 
siding genius of the editorial sanctum was 
Dostoevsky. A passion for beauty and 
justice in expression, sincerity and courage 
in ideas animated the young writers of the 
staff. They exalted the work of Charles- 
Louis Philippe. As editors and publish- 
ers, they were radical and constructive. 
And finally, in 1913, they founded the 
Theatre du Vieux Colombier. 

The inspiration for the little theatre, 
however, was not of such recent date. It 
was the outcome of many years of critical 
study and discussion. Jacques Copeau 
was a fighting dramatic critic long before 
he became an actor and manager. The 
Vieux-Colombier was founded, as one of 
its supporters has said, with something 
better than a new-born enthusiasm, "with 
the firm conviction of its artistic necessity 
and the knowledge, or prevision, of every 
difficulty to be encountered." It did not 
undertake to revolutionize either society 
or the drama, and it did not profess to 
know anything about the "drama of the 
future." Its passionate concern was with 
the present. The theatre, said M. Copeau, 
must be "renovated" from the founda- 
tion up. The Vieux-Colombier was 
announced, then, simply as an experiment 
in "dramatic renovation." 

The little group of artists encountered 
all the usual discouragements of innova- 
tors, skepticism, remonstrances, and gen- 
eral lack of confidence. But they were 
strong in their indignant revolt against 
the commercial desecration of the great 
social art of the theatre and in their com- 
pelling purpose not merely to arraign and 
condemn, but to start a theatre in oppo- 
sition. 

M. Copeau has accused the commercial 
theatre of alienating, in its dishonesty and 
viciousness, not only the intelligent and 
cultivated public, but the highest dramatic 
talent of author and actor, which has 
found refuge in other professions to the 



626 



THE DIAL 



[December 20 



incalculable loss of the drama. And the 
talent which remains, he contends, has 
been hurt and deformed. He found it 
necessary to "renormalize" the actors who 
came to him from the ranks of "profes- 
sionals." During one summer the sum- 
mer of 1913 they all worked together 
in the country, professionals and non-pro- 
fessionals, their only theatre a barn, far 
from the artificialities of the Paris stage, 
studying without haste and without weari- 
ness, in the revealing light of day, the 
inner realities of the drama. Slowly, the 
professional actors freed themselves from 
their "deformities" and the "stiff joints" 
of specialization, and became supple and 
'responsive again true dramatic instru- 
ments, like the talented young people and 
children whom M. Copeau likes to study 
and to teach. 

In a single season of three hundred per- 
formances the Theatre du Vieux Colom- 
bier passed far beyond the stage of 
experimentation and became a vitally 
important part of the cultural life of 
Paris. The public, to whom the commer- 
cial theatre was distasteful, rallied to its 
support. For the Vieux-Colombier had 
arrived just in time, as Andre Gide pointed 
out, to reconcile that public with the stage. 

Then came the war, and for a time the 
Theatre du Vieux Colombier appeared to 
be completely destroyed. The men of the 
company were either mobilized or volun- 
teered for the army. The doors of the 
little theatre were closed. But the dra- 
matic genius of its founder could not be 
crushed, and a year later M. Copeau be- 
gan his work of reorganization. Following 
a preliminary visit to this country last 
spring, he has succeeded in transporting 
the entire company to New York, where 
the Theatre du Vieux Colombier now 
stands, near by, but a little aside from, the 
theatrical market-place, a rebuke and an 
inspiration. 

The theatre opened its doors with a 
performance of Moliere's "Les Fourbe- 
ries de Scapin." The comedy was pre- 
ceded by a prologue, "L'lmpromptu du 
Vieux-Colombier" (in the manner of 
I'lmpromptu de Versailles), and followed 
by the ceremony of crowning a bust of 



Moliere, the Spirit of Comedy of all ages 
rendering homage to the French comic 
genius. But what most excited and held 
the attention was the intense, highly 
pitched, and original performance of "Les 
Fourberies de Scapin." 

In the production of the classics, the 
Vieux-Colombier aims to be neither 
"traditional" (which is another name for 
laziness, according to M. Copeau) nor 
presumptuously original. It desires only 
the originality which comes from a pro- 
found knowledge and interpretation of 
the text. "Nous nous efforcerons de nous 
remettre en etat de sensibilite." Little im- 
portance is given to stage decoration and 
accessories. M. Copeau does not quite 
agree with Paul Claudel that the theatre 
should be only a few boards thrown 
across two trestles, but he denies the im- 
portance of all "machinerie." Moliere, 
particularly, is played without decoration 
or atmosphere and in a reduced space. 
The action of the comedies is lost, M. 
Copeau maintains, on the large modern 
stage. Moliere designed the action with 
elaborate care, to fit the requirements of 
a very small platform. To produce him 
in any other way, to enlarge or modern- 
ize the scene, is to divorce text and action, 
and spoil Moliere. 

M. Copeau has modeled his stage for 
the production and not for the destruction 
of Moliere. The principal action takes 
place on a small cubic platform in the 
centre of the main stage, with steps on 
four sides. There is an apron, or fore- 
stage, which is frequently used; and diag- 
onal side-walls, next the proscenium, to 
the right and the left, contain doors with 
steps. A great variety of entrances, exits, 
and groupings is thus made possible, and 
extraordinarily close, rapid action. 

Jacques Copeau and his company are a 
true orchestra of dramatic instruments, 
playing with astonishing spontaneity and 
rhythm. They do not make Moliere "real- 
istic." Yet they are very natural. By a 
joyous kind of dramatic exaggeration, 
they attain what a French critic has 
termed "lyrisme du naturel." They reveal 
Moliere not only as a great comic writer 
but as an "artiste de la scene."

The Structure of Lasting Teace 

IV 

NATIONALITY, CITIZENSHIP, AND THE EUROPEAN 
STATE SYSTEM 

When, a year or two ago, President 
Wilson uttered his historic reproach of the 
"hyphenated American," he brought for 
an instant into the foreground of public 
opinion a little-considered quality of the 
existence of men which is basic to the 
solution of all problems of their relation- 
ships. Hyphenation is not political merely, 
it pervades the whole of life, increasing 
proportionately as civilization advances. 
Fundamentally it designates union and 
correlation, not separation, nor division. 
Every man is a hyphenate. Every man 
is the centre of an aggregate of relation- 
ships, which are normally cooperative and 
frequently conflicting. Every man's life 
is a constant compromise and choosing 
between alternatives so incompatible that 
all may not be completely satisfied at the 
same time. No man is, or can be, ex- 
clusively one thing and no other: son 
and husband, industrial baron and Chris- 
tian, trust magnate and patriot, German 
and American, pacifist and munitions- 
maker, breadwinner and conscript, church 
member and citizen a man may normally 
be all these at the same time and suddenly 
find himself confronted with the ineluctable 
necessity of choosing between one and 
another. Each implies reciprocal rights 
and duties, each makes insistent and clam- 
orous claims. Which shall be granted, 
which denied, instinct, tradition, habit, 
fear, imitation, standards of class and rank 
determine far more than intelligence. Yet 
at no point than in such choices is intelli- 
gence more needful or significant. 

What is important about the hyphena- 
tion of mankind is the classes into which 
it divides. Men are hyphenated by nature 
and by art. The relationships involved in 
the former are congenital and inalienable, 
internal to a man's character and 
coincident with his existence. The relation- 
ships involved in the latter are acquired 
or assured; external to a man's character 
and existence, alienable, and not indis- 
pensable. Nationality is a hyphenation 
belonging to the nature of things ; vocation, 



religion, citizenship are hyphenations 
created in the process of history. Men 
are born Irish or Jew or Chinese, and 
their association with men similarly born 
is involuntary and spontaneous. Men be- 
come farmers or carpenters or physicians, 
Christians or Mohammedans or Judaists 
or Buddhists, citizens of Russia or France 
or America, and their association with men 
similarly preoccupied is voluntary and 
directive, governed by considerations of 
advantage and the forces of circumstance. 
These associations men pass into and out of 
at need, or pleasure, or both. The others 
they cannot but remain in until they die. 
It is for the sake of those others, indeed, 
that vocation and religion and the state 
arose; to liberate their powers and to 
elaborate the idiom of their existence. 
Much of the trouble of civilized society 
derives from the fact that these artificial 
associations have overturned what they 
should have sustained, that they have 
changed from tools of living into purposes 
of life, that they have become idols. 

This is to-day even truer of economic 
and political associations than it was in 
the Middle Ages of the religious associa- 
tion they have replaced. Capital and the 
State are the idols of modernity, and the 
two are, as we have seen, so inter- 
penetrated that the worship of the one 
implies the worship of the other, even in 
democratically constituted states. I do 
not mean by this to deny that the economic 
order is at the foundation of civilized 
society. I mean merely to assert again 
the always obvious and always ignored 
truism that the economic order presupposes 
a community not economic which it serves, 
and that modernity's elaboration of it 
inconceivably beyond the effective gratifi- 
cation of human needs is unnecessary, and 
indeed inimical, to the free life of man- 
kind. In so far as this civil war which 
German dynastic interest has thrust upon 
the world seeks justification from the 
equating of economic advantage and polit- 
ical sovereignty with nationality, it seeks 
justification from a lie. In fact, the whole 
modern system of economic rivalries, sup- 
posedly inevitable under the "law of 
diminishing returns," is due to the mis- 
appropriation of economic endeavor to 



628 



THE DIAL 



[December 20 



dynastic and capitalistic uses, to the mili- 
tarist requirement of a "self-sufficient" 
state. Just and free conditions of economic 
endeavor break this law. As Simon Patten 
has shown, variation of uses and extension 
of consumability not only keep returns at 
par or increase them; they also multiply 
the "division of labor" and so generate 
cooperative interdependence. The com- 
petitive politico-economic system, with its 
tariffs and other dishonesties, rests upon 
sameness of economic enterprise; the 
greater the differentiation, the less the 
rivalry. 

The unnecessary existence of rivalry is 
a perversion of function in state and indus- 
try. These, it must be remembered, are 
tools, not ends. To use them democrati- 
cally is to use them in behalf of the free- 
ing and enhancement of inward and 
spontaneous differences, not their repres- 
sion. The most we can mean by law and 
justice and equality of opportunity is such 
an arrangement of the material upon which 
human life nourishes itself as will permit 
and extend the freest development, expres- 
sion, and interplay of human individuali- 
ties. Upon those and upon those alone 
are the essences of civilization and culture 
grounded and grown. And in those, 
nationalities interpenetrate and support 
each other. National genius requires an 
international soil and sustenance: the 
music, literature, painting, sculpture, and 
philosophies of peoples, their religions, 
and even their preeminent sciences are the 
most precious, the most excellent, the best 
known, and most honored, and yet the 
most intimate and national of their achieve- 
ments, and their substance and source are 
the most wide-ranging and diversified. 
For these, things of the spirit, protection 
is destruction; free-trade, strength. Eng- 
lish Shakespeare is nourished upon the 
Italian Renaissance; German Goethe (he 
avows it vehemently, again and again), 
upon English Shakespeare. Each is the 
declared national superlative of national- 
ity and each is superlatively hyphenated. 
The supremacies of the other institutions 
of national culture are similarly inter- 
national. Indeed, culture, of both the 
nation and the individual, is hyphenation. 
That is why the highest excellences are 



achieved by the more democratic peoples 
or the more democratic times, or both 
fifth century Athens, Augustan Rome, the 
city-states of Italy and Flanders, England 
from the eighteenth century on, France 
in the nineteenth century, Germany from 
the birth to the death of Goethe. For 
democracy, more basically than anything 
else, is hyphenation. Since the one and 
only thing democracy can mean is the sym- 
pathetic understanding of the other fellow, 
with his different origin, nature, back- 
ground, and outlook, and the free and 
cooperative recognition of his right to be 
and to thrive. Democracy, like human- 
ism, is the mind's reverence of, and the 
heart's sympathy for, individuality, and 
individuality never occurs except in 
nationalate form. Men are always Eng- 
lishmen, or Chinamen, or Frenchmen, or 
Germans, and so on; they are never merely 
men. Nationalities are the roots, and 
national cultures the fruits, of trees of 
human life whose soils are the economic 
and political systems that feed or starve 
them. These systems are not inherent 
parts of the nature of nationalities; they 
can be and are artificially altered without 
hurt to men. Nationalities can not be. 

What I am trying to say is this: the 
politico-economic establishments are need- 
ful guarantees and conditions of national- 
ity, but not its constituents. Democratic 
progress in such establishments would pro- 
vide for nationality the same fortune as is 
religion's. In the record of civilization 
religion is the first free manifestation of 
nationality. The cities and states of antiq- 
uity are distinguished primarily by their 
cults and their patron divinities, and the 
divinities have a direct or indirect ances- 
tral connection with their worshippers 
Athene for Athens, Phoebus for Sparta. 
Jehovah for Jerusalem. In the Middle 
Ages, cities and states are distinguished by 
their patron-saints St. George for Eng- 
land, St. Denis for France: Catholicism 
did not mean universality of cult; it meant 
a local and national and vocational particu- 
larism, with a general mythology and 
theology for background. Religious im- 
perialism, for which Catholicism is a 
euphemistic synonym, is the attempt t.> 
compel universal conformity in religious

matters. The history of that attempt is 
the darkest in the whole dark record of 
mankind from the torture and slaughter 
of heretics within the church, the exter- 
mination of Lollards and Hussites and 
other dissidents, the persecution of Jews, 
the assault upon Mohammedans, to the 
terrible religious wars of the Reformation. 
Its modern parallel is Germany's treat- 
ment of her victims. The establishment of 
tolerance was the establishment of democ- 
racy in the sphere of religion, the applica- 
tion of the principle of "live and let live" 
to associations whose differentiae were 
varying declarations about the unseen and 
its bearing upon the destiny of man. How 
deep the roots of such associations lie may 
be gathered from the fact that so 
vehement an Americanist as Mr. Roose- 
velt is still a member of the Dutch Re- 
formed Church. In this respect, as in 
many others, this ex-president, quite like 
other men, is still a hyphenate, and it is, on 
the whole, the irrelevance of this form of 
hyphenation to the actualities of his life 
that keeps it from creating a momentous 
option for him. And for all men, in our 
Christian civilization, save, perhaps, those 
who are Catholics, and owe allegiance to 
the pope. For with Protestantism there 
began a secularization of the world which 
more and more drove the religious con- 
cern from the centre to the periphery of 
human interest. Under the new and 
growing conditions of tolerance and free- 
dom sects multiplied, yet no one was the 
worse. The secular mood simply changed 
the role of religion back from an idol of 
life into a tool of living. Its connection 
with the state was severed and the power 
by means of which it was compelled to 
struggle for existence altered from physi- 
cal force to moral excellence. 

The place left vacant by religion was 
filled by nationality. Nationality is the 
secular aspect of the same self-conscious 
pride of social personality of which 
religion is the first utterance. In back- 
ward and mediaeval states the two still 
interpenetrate and imply each other; their 
criteria are doctrines of especial considera- 
tion from divinity and a special predesti- 
nate service to execute on its behalf: 
Germany, we are instructed, is a chosen 



people with a mission, boasting a state- 
religion beside which dissident sects are 
at a disadvantage. Free states, on the con- 
trary, have no room for either doctrine. 
They have permitted the sinister connec- 
tion of state and church to fall into 
desuetude, or have violently severed it, 
or have taken measures to prevent its aris- 
ing. Now underneath nationality, as 
underneath the religions of antiquity, there 
lies an actual or hypothetical consan- 
guinity of the individuals nationally asso- 
ciated, a hereditary inward similarity 
whose outward manifestation is the com- 
munity and culture of the associates. 
Clearly, the connection between political 
establishment and nationality is as un- 
necessary and monitory as that between 
state and church. The present civil war is 
the price mankind is paying for the 
modern error even as it paid for the 
mediaeval error. How little necessary the 
connection is between nationality and the 
state the history of nationalism itself 
shows, no less than the actual organization 
of various states Switzerland with her 
French and Italians and Germans, Great 
Britain with her English and Welsh and 
Scotch and Irish, Belgium with her Wal- 
loons and Flemings, the United States with 
all the nationalities of the world associated 
in the common American citizenship. 

Nationality, in a word, is as inde- 
pendent of citizenship as religion. A citi- 
zen is associated with his fellows in a 
state, for political purposes. These pur- 
poses are to guarantee to individuals and 
to groups, as our Declaration of Inde- 
pendence asserts, life, liberty, and the 
pursuit of happiness. Disentanglement of 
the state from religion has made it the 
guarantor of religious freedom. The next 
step in the liberation of mankind must be 
to detach it completely and everywhere 
from nationality that it may become the 
guarantor of national freedom, enfranchis- 
ing the inner life of nationalities for crea- 
tion and self-expression in the world of 
culture as it does sects in the realm of 
religion. That this is more and more the 
case in countries with free and responsible 
institutions need not be argued. But if 
peace is to become lasting, it must be made 
everywhere and equally the case.

And there's the rub. Even in the 
United States, in the very face of the facts 
of the daily life, men labor under the super- 
stition of the identity of nationality with 
citizenship, and the fanatical devotion to 
nationality among the Jugo-Slavs, the Irish, 
the Poles, the Lithuanians, to say nothing 
of the Germans, is certain, if peace be not 
made on the basis of an absolute divorce 
between citizenship and nationality, to 
maintain the war-creating system of inter- 
national disorganization. Democracy, on 
which peace ultimately depends, demands 
this divorce. Without it, the German con- 
ception of the state, particularly effective 
for wartimes, is bound to prevail. Accord- 
ing to this conception the state is the be-all 
and end-all of existence, greater than 
society and inclusive of it. Neither 
individuals nor groups have being or 
significance outside the state. They exist by 
its sufferance and live for its service. It 
is the Sole Individual, the great Whole, 
the synthesis and fulfilment of all human 
associations, antedating and superseding 
them, prior in existence and in right. Pre- 
cisely opposite is the democratic view. 
Democratic states are pluralistic. For 
democracy, political association is not 
primary, but secondary; not the synthesis 
of other associations, but one type added 
to the others, and maintained only so long 
as it effects the special purpose for which 
it was created. Its authority rests upon 
the "consent of the governed," is never 
absolute, never infallible. There is appeal 
from it, even, as John Locke says, "to 
heaven." He means that the right to rebel 
against bad government is inalienable, that 
the people are the sovereign, and all the 
people. 

When, therefore, states have failed, they 
have done so invariably because the power 
of government has been used by and for 
a part, against the whole of a people: in 
autocracies and oligarchies, by minorities 
against majorities; in democracies, by 
majorities against minorities. In this way 
the function of government, which is like 
that of the traffic police, so to keep the 
ways of life open that each traveller may 
have equal opportunity with his fellows to 
journey unhampered to his goal, becomes 
perverted and the law substitutes favorit- 



ism for equity. Of the "law of nations" 
this has been particularly true. The sys- 
tem of state sovereignties is answerable 
for all the forms of imperialism that 
derive from nationalistic aggression 
Germanification, Magyarization, Otto- 
manization, and so on, with all such 
programmes imply in the economic and 
political orders. Unless an international 
is substituted for this national system, the 
world will never be safe for democracy. 
To speak of a few cases in Europe alone, 
there are Magyar and German minorities 
in Bohemia and in the Austrian territory 
claimed by Rumania, just as there is a 
great Slavic majority in the Hungarian 
dominion; two-thirds of the Macedonia 
claimed by Serbia is inhabited by men of 
Bulgarian nationality; Alsace is largely 
German; a third of Poland is Jewish. A 
settlement according to "the principle of 
nationality" which would effect only a 
change in hegemony would have Europe 
at war again in less than a generation. 
Minorities must be safeguarded even as 
majorities must be freed if peace is to last, 
and minorities cannot be safeguarded 
without international guarantees that will 
once and for all divorce citizenship from 
nationality. Of course, such guarantees 
would constitute a comprehensive easement 
on the European system of state sovereign- 
ties and would require an elaborate ma- 
chinery to make them effective.

I have dreamed vaguely of a flaming light 
Growing somehow within the clash of things; 
I have hoped wanly that the sodden night 
Presaged a sunrise and the rush of wings. 
Is there such spirit born of raining lead, 
Such bloom of beauty from the shattered dead? 

You who have known war's maiming, iron clutch, 
Have breathed the wind of battle-breasting fire, 
Is there a chastening vigor in the touch 
The writhing flesh, the stench of bloody mire? 
Does there some rapture which pale peace with- 
stood 
Cry through the tumult that the earth is good?

Literary Affairs in London 

(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 
When I said in my last letter that I would 
return to Edward Thomas on the publication of 
his poems, I did not know that the book was 
almost ready. It is now out and lies before me 
as I write. It is a very remarkable collection. 

We have chastised ourselves enough recently 
with the reflection that we do not recognize our 
poets until they are dead ; and this thought is 
especially painful when they have given their 
lives for us in the war. It is some comfort, there- 
fore, to be able to say in the case of Thomas that 
the fault was his, not ours, though there is no 
doubt that we should have committed the fault 
if he had given us an opportunity. His poetry 
is a phenomenon as singular, in its own way, as 
that of Mr. A. E. Housman, on whom I have 
a word to say later. Thomas wrote no verse 
between quite early life and the middle thirties. 
Then, in 1913, he began to pour out a great 
number of queer, rather fierce, very intense poems, 
disconcerting in content and form, and unlike 
anything ever written by anyone else. I have 
been told that the poetry of Mr. Robert Frost 
gave him his first impulse; and that may be so, 
though the impulse never became an influence. 
However it may be, Thomas continued to write 
verses during the last four years of his life; and 
when he was killed in April on the first day 
of the battle for the Vimy Ridge, he left a con- 
siderable number of pieces behind him. The first 
of these (sixteen or so of them) had been pub- 
lished only a few weeks before in an "Annual 
of New Poetry" over the signature "Edward 
Eastaway"; and the literary public had not 
bestirred itself sufficiently to take any interest in 
them, when suddenly it heard that the author 
was Thomas and that he was dead. This volume 
now follows and there is, I am given to under- 
stand, another yet to come. 

I suggested in my last letter that Thomas was 
a disillusioned and somewhat embittered man. 
He spent the best of his youth over critical essays 
and books of literary travel which, though he did 
them as well as he could, that is to say, very 
well indeed, were not meant for permanence and 
will not be permanent. His was the minor 
tragedy of a man who, consenting to write for 
the market, was kept on the very margin of 
popularity by an uncompromising conscience and 
insisted on putting his best work into books for 
which, in themselves, he cared very little. The 



tone of his poetry conveys the impression that he 
felt that the gift for it had come to him too 
late. The poems deal throughout with the 
things which, as I suppose, made life endurable 
to him; but they alternate between the feeling 
that the loveliness of these things can only 
increase his own discontent and the other feeling 
that they are at best only attempts to hide the 
misery of life. It is as though he treated this 
stubborn and late-won talent with a certain dis- 
dain, holding it less in awe because it had come 
after the time to give him pleasure. And in his 
seeming indifference, he handles verse brusquely 
and carelessly and so gets out of it, again and 
again, effects of rhythm and description novel 
and marvelously penetrating. 

He writes of practically nothing but the 
country and he describes the country as it has 
never been described before. He is not a poet 
of white, woolly sheep, flowering hawthorn 
hedges, and the orange-colored harvest moon. He 
prefers to write about faggots of wood, dusty 
nettles or mud; and he gets his color-effect out 
of the opening of a pile of swedes. It is hard to 
choose out of the sixty odd pieces one or two 
that will exactly show his qualities. Here is one : 

There they stand, on their ends, the fifty faggots 

That once were underwood of hazel and ash 

In Jenny Pinks's Copse. Now, by the hedge 

Close packed, they make a thicket fancy alone 

Can creep through with the mouse and wren. Next 

Spring 

A blackbird or a robin will nest there, 
Accustomed to them, thinking they will remain 
Whatever is for ever to a bird: 
This Spring it is too late ; the swift has come. 
'Twas a hot day for carrying them up: 
Better they will never warm me, though they must 
Light several Winters' fires. Before they are done 
The war will have ended, many other things 
Have ended, maybe, that I can no more 
Foresee or more control than robin and wren. 

Here the mind has turned from the contempla- 
tion of an object with a succession of little, queer, 
involuntary thoughts; and the poet has surprised 
each of them and brought each alive into his 
verse. In another poem, which I will quote, he 
captures not the reflection but the moment of 
seeing, the very moment itself: 

Yes. I remember Adlestrop 

The name, because one afternoon 

Of heat the express-train drew up there 

Unwontedly. It was late June. 

The steam hissed. Someone cleared his throat. 

No one left and no one came 

On the bare platform. What I saw 

Was Adlestrop only the name 

And willows, willow-herb, and grass, 

And meadowsweet, and haycocks dry, 

No whit less still and lonely fair 

Than the high cloudlets in the sky

Thomas was not perhaps, probably never 
would have been, a great poet ; but he was a poet 
exquisitely true and exquisitely individual. 

I have no doubt that Professor A. E. Housman 
and his one book, "A Shropshire Lad," are names 
to conjure with in America, at least among a 
small circle of readers. His admirers there will 
be able to understand the thrill which certain 
Englishmen felt when they saw that signature 
under eight lines of verse in the "Times" on the 
third anniversary of the climax of the first Battle 
of Ypres. There is no doubt that some of us 
did feel a thrill. For Professor Housman pub- 
lished his one book, which contains sixty-three 
poems, twenty-one years ago and, except for one 
or two comic pieces, the unbendings of a classical 
scholar, and one poem which had pretty obviously 
been rejected from his book, he has maintained a 
complete silence ever since. And his book is 
very important in the history of modern English 
poetry. It has certain qualities which are entirely 
his own, and which he has not communicated, a 
sort of deep gloom, which is fresh instead of 
clammy, as though it were the shade of a very 
thick wood in early summer, and a sardonic, 
despairing humor, fierce, bitter, and destructive 
pleasantry at the expense of life. But it has 
also an extraordinary clearness of technique and 
economy of phrase, and these qualities have made 
a deep mark on subsequent English verse. The 
influence of the book has been subtle and sub- 
terranean, but I think that when we come to see 
our epoch in perspective, it will be easily dis- 
tinguished. And the latest crop of young war 
poets shows that it is as effective as ever. 

But the prestige of the book has undoubtedly 
been enhanced by its author's uncanny silence, 
to explain which many theories have been in- 
vented. It has been deduced most plausibly from 
the contempt for life shown in his book that the 
author simply thought more composition not 
worth his while. But there is a disparity between 
the poet and his poems which has made deeper 
the general perplexity. When he first came to 
Cambridge as regius professor of Latin, the 
Dons of Trinity, of which college he had been 
made a fellow, got out their copies of the "Shrop- 
shire Lad" with that confused noise which passes 
for a buzz of excitement in our universities. 
They read with attention and gathered a general 
impression of seduction, desertion, murder, sui- 



cide, and execution by hanging. They then went 
to dine in hall and saw a rather small, rather 
round man, with a beaming expression and a 
good appetite. They returned in silence to their 
rooms and read again, receiving the same impres- 
sion, mitigated only by an occasional suggestion 
of premature but natural death. They have not 
solved the mystery yet ; nor has anyone else. But 
this sort of thing explains the reputation that 
Professor Housman enjoys. His poem in the 
"Times" was an epitaph on the original British 
Expeditionary Force and, though it was 
supremely well-turned the author could no 
doubt have turned it as well in Latin it was 
hardly so good as the weakest thing in the 
"Shropshire Lad." But it caused a thrill in a 
greater number of readers than I, fearing to be 
thought foolish, should care to guess at. 

Two books of that sort which approaches with 
a noise like a train coming through a tunnel are 
out and are keeping the omniscient reviewers 
mightily busy. Lord Morley's "Recollections" 
are less stiff and inhuman than I expected they 
would be, but they contain precisely the number 
of revelations that I anticipated that is to say. 
none at all. The book is a monument of the 
later Victorian age of the agnostic Liberalism 
which died very hard but is now quite dead. Lord 
Morley, who shook his head sadly over the 
extravagances of Rousseau, is more at home with 
G. H. Lewes, Spencer, and Mill ; and, while one 
is under the spell, one almost believes that these 
were great men of the very first order. But 
the spell vanishes and the belief with it. Some 
day some impressionistic historian, of a type yet 
to be evolved, working from documents and writ- 
ing with a touch of dry satire, will compose the 
perfect history of nineteenth-century England. 
Lord Morley's "Recollections" will be a most 
useful part of his material. 

The other book of this sort is Sir Sidney Col- 
vin's new life of Keats, a marvelous production 
which, in five hundred and fifty large, closely 
printed pages, relates fully everything that is 
known of the poet and renders any other biog- 
raphy impossible, perhaps forever. Sir Sidney 
has little new material but he writes with genial- 
ity and a very genuine love for his subject. His 
criticism is not enterprising but it is very sound 
and very full. His book has, in short, German 
thoroughness without German absurdity; it i^ 
the sort of book that I should like someone to 
write about Goethe. And it almost encourages

the idea that our learned men think English 
poetry a matter of living importance. 

I made a mistake in an earlier letter for which 
I must apologize. Mr. W. B. Yeats's new 
volume of poems, which has now been published 
in Ireland in a limited and expensive edition, is 
not called "Per Arnica Silentia Lunae" (which 
is another book) but "The Wild Swans at 
Coole." These poems are very good but very 
eerie, and the impression that their author is no 
human child, but a changeling, gains ground.

THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE. By Vachel Lind- 
say. (The Macmillan Co.; $1.25.) 
LUSTRA. By Ezra Pound. (Alfred A. Knopf; 
$1.50.) 

It is something of a surprise and a good deal 
of a relief to pick up a volume of poetry these 
days that does not "interpret" the war. One 
gets a bit wearied of old rhetoric and ante-bellum 
platitudes refurbished with post-Kipling metres 
and a few martial metaphors. One turns to 
such a volume as Vachel Lindsay's latest with 
anticipation and reads it with something like 
disappointment. For, after a colorful and en- 
ticing opening, we are plunged into two whole 
sections of pedestrian poetry about "Mark Twain 
and Joan of Arc," and "Where is the Real 
Non-Resistant"; about Kerensky and Jane Ad- 
dams and Bryan and "our mother Pocahontas" 
and similarly timely personages. All these may 
be imbued with the poetic stuff, but in reducing 
them to rhyme, the result is anything but poetry. 
Nor is the verse materially strengthened by Mr. 
Lindsay's mental attitude. We see him wavering 
between a frank horror of all wars and a hesitant 
justification of this particular one. This inse- 
curity of intellectual base recalls how anxious 
a position Mr. Lindsay maintained in his previ- 
ous volumes; how hazardously he balanced him- 
self in a devotion to a liberal socialism on one 
hand and a strict prohibition on the other. A 
pagan by intention and a puritan by intuition. 
Pulled one way, as a poet, by the imperious de- 
mands of beauty, and another way, as a propa- 
gandist, by the moral dictates of the uplift 
crusade, he shows a vacillation, almost pathetic, 
between a universal compulsion and, to be literal, 
local option. Any admirer of Lindsay will ob- 



serve with distrust this growing insistence on 
the sermonizing feature of his work. The 
preacher seems to be in the ascendancy, the Chau- 
tauquan threatens to dominate the artist. In 
"General Booth Enters into Heaven," "The 
Congo," "The Eagle that is Forgotten," "Sun- 
shine," "The Leaden Eyed," there was a strange- 
ly successful mingling of these two forces; the 
blend of poetry and pamphleteering became pow- 
erful and persuasive. But in the present volume, 
it is somewhat disturbing to witness Lindsay 
hitching his clipped Pegasus in front of the meet- 
ing-house and mounting the worn-out steps to 
deliver himself of such orotund banalities as: 

Would that the lying rulers of the world 
Were brought to block for tyrannies abhorred. 
Would that the sword of Cromwell and the Lord, 
The sword of Joshua and Gideon, 
Hewed hip and thigh the hosts of Midian. 
God send that ironside ere tomorrow's sun ; 
Let Gabriel and Michael with him ride. 
God send the Regicide. 

or the still flatter wordiness of: 

When Bryan speaks, the sky is ours, 
The wheat, the forests, and the flowers. 
And who is here to say us nay? 
Fled are the ancient tyrant powers. 

When Bryan speaks, then I rejoice. 

His is the strange composite voice 

Of many million singing souls 

Who make world-brotherhood their choice ! 

It is a relief to turn from these, skipping over 
such matters as the attempt to make jingles 
(such as "Niagara") look like war poems, and 
pass to a poem like "The Ghosts of the Buffa- 
loes." Here Lindsay's native fancy is given 
free swing; he carries the reader on a midnight 
scamper with nothing more purposeful than the 
driving power of imagination. Or examine "The 
Prairie Battlements." Here again Lindsay is 
not trying to prove anything or convince anyone ; 
he is concerned only with trying to snare a glim- 
mering and elusive beauty. No village improve- 
ment societies will embroider it on their banners ; 
no anti-vice crusades will take it up as a slogan ; 
and yet I like to feel that the real Lindsay is in 
these unofficial and merely beautiful poems. 
Witness these lines, a part of "The Broncho 
That Would Not Be Broken." 

The grasshoppers cheered. "Keep whirling," they 

said. 

The insolent sparrows called from the shed 
"If men will not laugh, make them wish they were 

dead." 

But arch were your thoughts, all malice displacing, 
Though the horse-killers came, with snake-whips 

advancing. 

You bantered and cantered away your last chance. 
And they scourged you, with Hell in their speech 

and their faces, 
O broncho that would not be broken of dancing.

"Nobody cares for you," rattled the crows, 

As you dragged the whole reaper, next day, down 
the rows. 

The three mules held back, yet you danced on your 
toes. 

You pulled like a racer, and kept the mules chasing. 

You tangled the harness with bright eyes side- 
glancing, 

While the drunk driver bled you a pole for a 
lance 

And the giant mules bit at you keeping their places. 

O broncho that would not be broken of dancing. . . 

It is easy to turn the entire poem into a piece of 
pretty symbolism. The little colt-broncho is the 
artist or possibly he is beauty or joy; the crows 
are the inevitable and discouraging critics; the 
drunk driver and the mules are the forces that 
try to make art a utilitarian affair and break it 
to harness, and so on and so on. The charm of 
such a poem, however, is in nothing so intellec- 
tual. It is in the homely fantasy, the natural 
extravagance that is so native to Lindsay and 
which he communicates so individually. I call 
attention again to the title poem that opens the 
volume with its subdued and varying chant; to 
the amazing "John Brown," which begins with 
a childlike catalogue and runs through negro 
pomposity to a picturesque and powerful close; 
to "Simon Legree," possibly the richest and 
raciest piece in the collection, with its fallacious 
moral and its rollicking high spirits. It is this 
last quality that keeps one from becoming per- 
turbed by Lindsay's growing churchliness. It is 
the whimsical buoyancy, the side spring, the gay 
appraisal of loveliness that keeps Lindsay the mis- 
sionary from superseding Lindsay the minstrel. 
His morals may tame the man; they will never 
be able to keep a bit and bridle on his magic. 
Ezra Pound's volume is a far more puzzling 
affair. Its range and variety are its most out- 
standing quality and its chief defect. The vol- 
ume seems a catch-all for Pound's slightest 
utterance. Poems in the imagist manner, lugu- 
brious cantos in a Sordello form, arrangements 
in the vorticist vein, epigrams from the Greek, 
Lalage and other ladies from the Latin, para- 
phrases from the German, scraps from the early 
Anglo-Saxon, snatches from the Spanish, idioms 
from the Italian, water-colors from the Chinese, 
echoes from Provence one gets nothing so much 
as a confused jumble and smattering of erudi- 
tion. The effect is less that of the man of the 
world than the man about literature. All is 
carefully noted, collected, tagged, and set down. 
Nothing is too inconsequential or unworthy of 
inclusion. It is all here; even the absurd apos- 
trophe to Swinburne ("Salve Pontifex") and 
the inane, schoolboy burlesque of "Summer is 



icumen in." What makes this lust for print 
the more puzzling is the fact that Mr. Pound 
has not only a critical but a selective gift. In 
fact the latter concentrative quality (as is proved 
by the transcriptions of Fenollosa's notes, "Ca- 
thay") is his most salient trait. What then will 
even his youngest disciple say to the awkward 
and malformed versions of the eight Heine poems 
that read like so many humorless parodies, the 
paper-motto silliness of such a couplet as: 

THE NEW CAKE or SOAP 
Lp, how it glistens in the sun 
Like the cheek of a Chesterton. 

and "Papyrus," which I quote in its entirety: 

PAPYRUS 
Spring. . . . 
Too long. . . 
Gongula. . . 

White paper is evidently not so precious as the 
publishers would have us believe. 

This overmastering desire to exhibit every 
triviality, to let not one bad joke blush unseen, 
spoils many a bright page and most of the vol- 
ume. Pound chatters on, and his wandering 
loquacity dulls the edge of a really keen irony. 
(A badly mixed metaphor, no doubt, but one 
direct from the barber's chair.) The patient 
reader will find and delight in such sharp per- 
formances as "Phasellus Ille," "New York," 
"Arides," "Portrait D'Une Femme," "The So- 
cial Order," "Salutation," and "Commission," 
where cold irony gives way to a hot anger. I 
quote the first few lines: 

Go, my songs, to the lonely and the unsatisfied ; 
Go also to the nerve-wracked, go to the enslaved-by- 

convention, 

Bear to them my contempt for their oppressors. 
Go, as a great wave of cool water, 
Bear my contempt of the oppressors. 

Speak against unconscious oppression, 

Speak against the tyranny of the unimaginative, 

Speak against bonds. 

Any lover of aesthetics will also find much to 
admire in the subtleties of light, shadow, move- 
ment and what is naively called "atmosphere" 
in such brief pictures as "Albatre," "Fish," "The 
Encounter," the "Fan-Piece for Her Imperial 
Lord" (an excellent example of condensation 
from an original many times as long), "The 
Coming of War" and this 

IN A STATION OF THE METRO 
The apparition of these faces in the crowd; 
Petals on a wet, black bough. 

But "Lustra" is something more than a hap- 
hazard and too inclusive collection; it is the rec- 
ord of a retreat, a gradual withdrawal from 
life. In the early days when Pound first moved 
his physical lar and his aesthetic penates to Lon-

don, he gave promise of achieving a personal 
utterance to match a decided personality. In 
many of the early poems, such as "Pierre Vidal 
Old," "Ballad of Gloom," and the exquisite 
"Greek Epigram" (all originally in "Personae" 
and "Exultations"), the influence of Browning 
and Bertran de Born was unmistakable. But it 
was not overmastering, and it was confidently 
expected that a few years would bring Pound 
to a more striking and less scholastic habit of 
mind. The first part of this expectation was 
fulfilled, but, strangely enough, it only placed an 
emphasis on his inverted scholasticism. Pound, 
it became evident, was no pioneer, no intrepid 
traveller; he was always an exponent of "move- 
ments," a schoolman, alternating between an in- 
curably romantic veneration of the past and an 
even more cloistral aversion to the crowd. Now 
it is classicism that he embraces, now imagism, 
now a furtive effort to look at the violence of 
life in the terms of vorticism always the con- 
tact with the actual world is feared. More and 
more he shrinks back into literature. And so 
in "Lustra," we find him established. He has 
become a connoisseur of the curious; a haunter 
of old bookstalls ; a formalist arguing in a musty 
and deserted classroom. The library is his ivory 
tower, and he has locked himself in. Once in a 
while he opens a window and hears people laugh- 
ing and brawling in the street. But he listens 
only for a moment. The window is slammed, 
the curtains are drawn, the perfumed candles lit 
and he is back again, picking his way through 
literatures, amassing technicalities and dreaming 
of himself in his favorite role the pedagogue in 
power, the pundit on parade. The sum total of 
all this is staggering, the net result infinitesimal. 
Pound has gone on, collecting cultures, and 
all they have yielded him is an accent, an atti- 
tude. He poses before the mirror of his art and 
drapes himself in a coat of many colors that he 
has taken, patch by patch, from other and more 
authentic designers. He has really little to say, 
but he says it in a manner that gives his words 
a superficial significance. It is not so much the 
phrase as the gesture that accompanies it that is 
distinguished and arresting. It is this gesture 
that explains and identifies Pound. Some of his 
followers who are not so well known have sur- 
passed him in his own metiers: the Aldingtons 
are far more Hellenic and chiseled than he ; T. S. 
Eliot has a much lighter touch in recording the 
ironies and overtones of conversation; John 
Gould Fletcher is a more successful experimenter 
in the clash of colors; Maxwell Bodenheim has 



a more delicate and dextrous imagination and a 
far greater feeling for words but Pound tri- 
umphs in the gesture. He puts up his hand, his 
fingers become nimble, his eyebrows go up and 
what, when spoken, is tawdry and trivial, be- 
comes glamorous with a possible mystery. This 
is his power. The escape into literature is com- 
plete ; the poetry is mostly dumb show, but he 
can still simulate life. He is Gordon Craig's 
super-marionette and his art is poetry in pan- 
tomime. LQUIS UNTERMEYER . 



A Freudian Half -Holiday 

DELUSION AND DREAM. An Interpretation in the 
Light of Psychoanalysis of Gradiva, a Novel, by 
Wilhelm Jensen. By Dr. Sigmund Freud. Trans- 
lated by Helen M. Downey. (Moffat, Yard & 
Co.; $2.) 

To what extent can true psychologic insight, 
not consciously determined by objective experi- 
ence, be credited to the literary artist? Is there 
such a thing as an intuition or instinct of psychic 
verity anticipating, nay transcending, the more 
laborious constructions of the systematic psy- 
chologist? And has the latter nothing but 
admiration and envy for the great artist's un- 
guided, yet infallible, unravelings of the mys- 
teries of the human soul? Perhaps. At least 
we may grant without fear of contradiction that 
modern psychology might rest content with the 
assurance of but half the grasp of mental phe- 
nomena that the great army of Shakespearean 
interpreters have, at one time and place or 
another, ascribed to their liege lord. And how 
does it stand with psychoanalysis? Have the not 
altogether self-evident psychic mechanisms that 
Freud has disinterred for us ever been anticipated 
in toto in a work of fiction ? It is not a question 
of whether this or that isolated bit of psychoan- 
alytic theory finds its parallel or confirmation in 
literature, such convergences of thought may 
be instanced by the hundred, but of whether 
there are to be found anywhere a literary plot and 
an underlying psychological analysis that are com- 
parable to a typical psychoanalytic clinical picture. 
The latest addition of Messrs. Moffat, Yard 
& Co. to their rapidly growing library of psy- 
choanalytic literature undertakes to answer this 
question. It consists of two parts : a short novel, 
or Novelle, by the prolific German writer Wil- 
helm Jensen, entitled "Gradiva, a Pompeiian 
Fancy"; and a Freudian interpretation of this 
work of fiction, "Delusion and Dream in Jen-

sen's Gradfoa" The intrinsic literary merit of 
"Gradiva" hardly concerns us, except in so far 
as it puts us in an initially responsive or begrudg- 
ing mood when confronted by the succeeding 
commentary. The translator, as usual in these 
Moffat, Yard & Co. translations from the 
German, has done her best to create a haze of 
literalness separating us from too close intellect- 
ual contact with the writer, yet I doubt whether 
even the best type of rendering would have 
altogether made credible Freud's own estimate of 
the aesthetic value of the story. It has the same 
heavy combination of sentimental fancy and 
rather coarse jocularity that, in such tales as 
"Die Nonna" and "Hoher als die Kirche," was 
served up to us in high-school days. The "fancy" 
wings its flight in comfortable view of German 
Gemutlichkeit. It is with somewhat of a shock 
that we learn that the Gustav Freitag-Paul Heyse 
type of sentimentality was still flourishing in 
Germany in 1903; presumably its germs are still 
intact. Of the jocular note running through 
Jensen's fantasia Freud seems a bit oblivious, 
perhaps because there are weightier matters in 
hand. And yet, that Freud's sense of humor is 
not altogether in abeyance and that he is aware 
of the smallness of the step that separates inter- 
pretative acuity from flight iness is shown by the 
final remark with which he calls a halt to his 
own resourcefulness: "But we must stop or we 
may forget that Hanold and Gradiva are only 
creatures of our author." All psychoanalysts 
who are capable of making reservations should 
thank Freud for this sly dig in his own ribs. 

Let all this not obscure the fact that Freud 
makes a case, and indeed a very plausible and 
sharp-witted one. Aside from certain short- 
comings, psychoanalytically considered, of Jensen 
himself, and aside from a few cases of rather 
evident overdoing it on Freud's part, the accord 
of "Gradiva" with psychoanalytic requirements 
is remarkable enough, however one chooses to 
explain it, and this despite the obvious fact that 
the suggestion of anything like psychological 
plausibility was far from Jensen's conscious mind. 
That Jensen intended to move almost entirely in 
the realm of pure fancy is indicated by two or 
three of his assumptions, assumptions credible 
only in a fantasia. The reader of the novel must 
take for granted, without motivation, the com- 
plete identity in appearance and manner of walk- 
ing of Zoe Bertgang, the long-forgotten childhood 
playmate of Hanold, the archaeologist, and of 
Gradiva of the bas-relief dug up at Pompeii; 



the meeting of Zoe and Hanold, who are next- 
door neighbors in a German town, in Pompeii 
itself; and the fact of Hanold's strange forget- 
fulness. The nucleus of the tale is the abnormal 
interest that Hanold takes in the bas-relief, more 
particularly in Gradiva's very peculiar trick of 
lifting the foot in walking. Psychoanalytically, 
this interest, which leads to fancies of a delusive 
nature, is interpretable as a substitutivc form of 
expression of the sexual instinct, all direct and 
normal manifestations of which have been denied 
an outlet by the conscious self. The reason for 
the repression, however, is not evident, for 
Hanold's intensive preoccupation with classical 
archaeology is, at best, but an occasion or shaping 
circumstance, not a sufficient cause. At least so 
psychoanalysis; Jensen may have other ideas of 
what constitutes causality in a fantasia. As the 
only sexually utilizable material antedating the 
repression is Hanold's childish relations to Zoe, 
now "remembered" only by the unconscious, it is 
natural that the dammed instinct should feed on 
a representation linked, via this unconscious 
memory, with his childish past. We have, there- 
fore, in Hanold's infatuation with the bas-relief 
a typical example of the unconscious infantile 
fixation which is so frequently at the back of 
neurotic phenomena. His delusional fancies are, 
in effect, a compromise formation induced by two 
conflicting volitional streams, the sexual impulse 
and the repressive force ; they "satisfy" the former 
through the power of an unconscious series of 
associations, the latter by guaranteeing a flight 
from sexual reality. The psychoanalytic com- 
plexion of Jensen's "Gradiva" extends far beyond 
this delusional nucleus to a considerable number 
of details. Emotional transference, rationaliza- 
tion of motive, unconscious symbolization of 
desire, regression to infantile experiences all 
these familiar aspects of Freudian thinking find, 
or seem to find, frequent illustration in the novel. 
The very name Gradiva, "splendid in walking," 
which has been bestowed by Hanold on the girl 
of the bas-relief, turns out to be, as Jensen him- 
self points out, but the Latinized equivalent of 
the living girl's surname, Bertgang ; that Hanold 
fancies something Hellenic in the features of the 
Pompeiian girl is a distorted reflex of the uncon- 
sciously remembered name Zoe; his sudden 
departure for Pompeii, apparently a poorly mo- 
tivated caprice, is plausibly explained by Freud 
it symbolizing both his desire for Zoe-Gradiva 
(consciously rationalized as an absurd quest of 
Gradiva's peculiar footprints in the lava of Pom- 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



637 



peii) and his unconscious fear of Zoe, the work 
of the repression. To at least some extent 
Freud's detailed analyses of two of the dreams 
introduced by Jensen carry conviction, but only 
to some extent. The treatment of the "latent 
content" of the dreams is less plausible than the 
analysis of the delusions. This is precisely as it 
should be, for the chances of constructing dreams 
possessing psychological verisimilitude are not 
very high. Finally, the cure of Hanold's delu- 
sions effected by Zoe may be described as an 
abridged replica of the Freudian psychotherapy. 

What are we to make of it all? Jensen him- 
self "testily" denied all knowledge of psycho- 
analysis. Are we then, with Freud, driven to 
ascribe to Jensen a high degree of instinctive 
psychological insight, an artist's intuition that 
more than makes up for ignorance of psycho- 
logical theory? In view of the very moderate 
artistic ability displayed by Jensen and the ob- 
vious lack of deep earnestness in his treatment 
of the plot, one hesitates to commit himself to 
Freud's thesis. We might be less disinclined to 
follow Freud if the author of "Gradiva" were 
a Shakespeare, a Balzac, or a Dostoevsky. Per- 
haps we are unfair to Jensen. An unprejudiced 
survey of his other works might bring convic- 
tion. Yet would it, after all, be rash to seek a 
less ambitious explanation in what the ethnolo- 
gists term "cultural convergence" ? Jensen might 
have started with the purely mechanical idea of 
tying an arbitrarily interrupted past to a 
sentimental present and have hit upon the device 
of unconscious sous-entendus as a convenient 
means. This would be tantamount to an uncon- 
scious aping of the psychoanalytic procedure. It 
would also explain Jensen's failure to motivate 
what Freud interprets as a repression. Or, still 
more plausibly, a modicum of psychological in- 
sight, say into the facts of unconscious memory, 
may have been helped out by such a mechanical 
device as is here suggested. 

However we decide as to the psychoanalytic 
credentials of Wilhelm Jensen, we may accept 
Freud's study as a sugar-coated introduction to 
the subject of psychoanalysis itself. As such it 
may have its uses. A scientific confirmation of 
Freudian psychology it can hardly claim to be. 
While it does not seem to the reviewer to repre- 
sent a full day's work in the psychoanalytic work- 
shop, it is too good a thing to be dismissed as 
the vagary of an off day. May not Freud have 
taken a half-holiday when he wrote it?

The Polyglot Empire 

AUSTRIA-HUNGARY: THE POLYGLOT EMPIRE. By 
Wolf von Schierbrand. (Frederick A. Stokes 
Co.; $3.) 

HISTORY OF SERBIA. By Harold W. V. Tern- 
perley. (Macmillan Co.; $4.) 

The war began in southeastern Europe; its 
principal cause was the Mittel-Europa project of 
Germany, looking to the bridging of the Balkans 
and the Bosphorus with a German-controlled 
political and economic empire ; and while the ulti- 
mate military decision will undoubtedly be 
reached on the soil of France, Belgium, or Ger- 
many, many of the major problems of the paci- 
fication will centre about the future of the lands 
of the east and south. Prominent among these 
problems will be the restoration and indemnifi- 
cation of Servia. Strong interest will attach also 
to the fate of the loose-jointed, sorely beset 
dual monarchy, Austria-Hungary, its boundary 
changes, its political reconstruction (whether 
complete dissolution, fuller federalization, or 
closer consolidation), and its economic ruin or 
possible rehabilitation. 

In his "Austria-Hungary: The Polyglot Em- 
pire" Mr. Wolf von Schierbrand, traveller and 
journalist, has written a popular account of the 
Austro-Hungarian peoples, their racial difficulties, 
political life, economic problems, and war con- 
ditions, which, although on the whole less useful 
than Geoffrey Drage's well-known "Austria- 
Hungary," has the advantage of being consider- 
ably more recent and more readable. The author 
lived in Austria-Hungary from 1912 until 1917. 
He strongly disclaims the intention to write "a 
mere war book." Yet more than a third of his 
chapters deal specifically with the state of the 
country during the war, and the chief value of his 
work lies in the fact that it furnishes almost the 
only intimate account that we have of what has 
been going on in the Hapsburg dominions since 
the war began. 

All the world knows that the crux of the Aus 
tro-Hungarian situation is, and has always been, 
the interrelations of the empire-kingdom's multi- 
fold racial groups. After fairly well outlining 
the elements in this problem, Mr. von Schier- 
brand discusses with some deftness the problem's 
inherent difficulty, and goes on to consider the 
possible lines of its solution. He shows that the 
American "melting-pot" theory has no applica- 
tion in the dual monarchy, mainly for the reason 
that all the bitterly contending racial elements 
Germans, Poles, Czechs, Ruthenians, Magyars, 



638 



THE DIAL 



[December 20 



Slovaks, Serbs, Italians, and what not claim 
their dwelling places as their ancestral homes, 
look upon their neighbors as intruders and foes, 
cling tenaciously to their cultural inheritances, 
and regard any union with their rivals as ulti- 
mately desirable only if they themselves are left 
in a position to rule. The view is taken that the 
present war will make it necessary to "cut the 
Gordian knot"; although we are also told that, 
without the war, matters could not long have 
gone as they were. 

Assuming that it is forever impossible to weld 
the polyglot populations of the monarchy into a 
compact state, the author contends that the only 
feasible course, if the Hapsburg dominions are 
not to dissolve utterly, is to grant to every impor- 
tant racial group the essentials of self-govern- 
ment. He describes the plan of the late Archduke 
Francis Ferdinand to supersede the Aus- 
gleich with an instrument reorganizing the 
dominions on a triple instead of a dual basis, 
with Austria, Hungary, and a Jugoslav (South 
Slav) union as distinct political entities; and he 
shows that this interesting plan would have 
fallen quite short of its object, not only because 
of the hostility of the Hungarians, but because 
such other reforms as were to have gone with it 
would still have left under the Emperor's sway 
a dozen discontented nationalities. The Arch- 
duke's scheme did not go far enough. "The only 
radical remedy for the ills which race strife has 
bred in Austria-Hungary is self-government for 
each and every part of the whole. The ideal 
must, in fact, be the establishment of something 
like a United States of Austria-Hungary, only 
more so. That is, the self-government in each 
state of this prospective federation must be, to 
accomplish all that is desired, more complete 
than it is in its American prototype. Common 
ties must be confined to a very few." 

That there are tremendous obstacles to such 
a readjustment is freely admitted. But the author 
feels certain that between it and the utter disso- 
lution of the monarchy there will be, after the 
war, no middle ground, and he ventures the pre- 
diction that "probably the means will be found." 
It may be added that in his speech opening the 
Reichsrath last May the young successor of 
Francis Joseph pointed the way to a constitu- 
tional reorganization based on greatly increased 
autonomy for the "kingdoms and lands" of the 
monarchy. 

Mr. von Schierbrand makes the common mis- 
take of supposing that foot-notes and bibliograph- 



ical lists frighten away the "general" reader; 
they do so only if the subject treated or the man- 
ner of treatment is itself dull. The present vol- 
ume would gain greatly by being to some extent 
documented. Important information is given 
and interesting judgments are passed with no 
citation of sources, authorities, or other means 
of corroboration ; so that while the book as a 
whole carries weight as the work of a competent 
and sympathetic observer, it lacks the value for 
the scholar and publicist which one would sup- 
pose it might readily have been given. 

A book of very different type is Mr. Temper- 
ley's "History of Serbia." Its author is known 
as a tireless explorer of the diplomatic collections 
of the British Record Office, and as the writer 
of more than one scholarly volume on modern 
international relations. Begun as a history of 
Serbia from the revival of her independence in 
the nineteenth century to the Balkan war of 
1912, the present work has broadened into a his- 
tory reaching backward to the first coming of 
the Southern Slavs into their Danubian and Bal- 
kan habitats. It closes with the events of 1910. 
The book bristles with evidence of painstaking 
research ; it is well documented ; and it contains 
a select bibliography of very satisfactory propor- 
tions. 

The writing of Balkan history is a task calling 
for peculiar talents. The sources are plentiful, 
yet fragmentary and conflicting. Fundamentals 
are exceptionally difficult to hew from labyrinths 
of detail. Above all, it is hard not to be influ- 
enced by the susceptibilities and prejudices of the 
numerous rival nationalities. In the Balkans, it 
has been well said, history is a sort of padtk 
warfare in which every native scholar is a gen- 
eral. 

Mr. Temperley has overcome these difficulties 
with notable success. He has the advantage 
which falls to the onlooker as against the par- 
ticipant. He is a master of sound historical criti- 
cism. And he has simplified his problem by 
tracing the fortunes of a single branch of the 
South Slavic race, rather than trying to write a 
composite history. Similar treatment of the Bos- 
nians, the Serbo-Croats, the Slovenes, and other 
South Slav peoples would make for clearness of 
comprehension by the outside world. 

In the light of the author's conclusions, the 
tragedy of Serbia under Austro-Hungarian con- 
quest takes on added color. "If there ever is 
a Southern Slav federation," he affirms, "it will 
be because of the kingdom of Serbia, which h,^

held up the same kind of hope and example of 
unity to the Southern Slavs that the kingdom 
of Piedmont did to the Southern Italians. The 
history of the Serbian race in Montenegro and 
Serbia is therefore the most important, because 
these lands are the core of that rugged stock 
which has preserved or achieved freedom, and 
thus become a hope and a beacon to the Slavs 
enslaved under rulers or imprisoned in other 
lands." This judgment is the more impressive 
by reason of the fact that throughout his narra- 
tive the author makes no attempt to obscure the 
weaknesses and faults of the Serbs, and especially 
of their ruling dynasties.

Greek Vases 

DOURIS AND THE PAINTERS OF GREEK VASES. By 

Edmond Pottier. Translated by Bettina Kahn- 
weiler. (E. P. Button & Co.; $2.50.) 
EUTHYMIDES AND His FELLOWS. By Joseph Clark 
Hoppin. (Harvard University Press; $4.) 

The average museum visitor, in his wander- 
ings through the galleries of Europe and Amer- 
ica, usually passes by with but a swift glance 
the cases of black and red Greek pottery, thus 
unwittingly depriving himself of a pleasure 
afforded by the works of but few periods in 
the history of art. For the value of the study 
of Greek vases, battered and fragmentary though 
their condition frequently is, lies in the fact, 
first, that they afford us an amazing revelation 
of Greek life. Second, they yield a unique 
pleasure to the mind sensitive to certain aesthetic 
qualities to balance and exquisite adaptation 
of figures to space, to the grace of curved lines, 
the swiftness and firmness of straight; and this, 
too, notwithstanding the fact that the painters 
were probably mere craftsmen. Third, to the 
person gifted with imagination, they offer a 
conception, vague though it may be, of the 
general character and development of Greek 
drawing and painting, a lost art, now known 
only through meagre literary references. 

Of interest to those who have already acquired 
a love for the Greek vase, as well as to those 
who may desire to gain an understanding of the 
craft, is the publication of three volumes which 
will help to fill the need for books on this sub- 
ject in English. Two have already appeared 
Miss Bettina Kahnweiler's translation of M. 
Pottier's "Douris et Les Peintres des Vases 
Grecs," and Mr. Hoppin's "Euthymides and 



his Fellows"; while the third, Mr. J. D. Beaz- 
ley's "Attic Red Figured Vases in American 
Museums," is announced by the Harvard Uni- 
versity Press as a forthcoming work. And it is 
of peculiar advantage that the first two, at least, 
treat of the subject at the most inspiring point 
in its evolution, when, for naivete, freshness of 
imagination, and the ethical quality of its strug- 
gle to solve problems inherent in the developing 
technique of drawing, it is comparable with the 
art of the fifteenth century in Italy. 

For the layman, no book can serve better as an 
introduction to the subject than that of M. 
Pottier. This first-rate authority on Greek 
vases, abandoning technicalities and moot ques- 
tions, has brought all his learning to a simple 
and sympathetic exposition of the subject, not for 
the professional archaeologist, as he says in his 
opening sentences, but for the reading public. 
His monograph is now made more accessible 
through Miss Kahnweiler's translation, to which 
has been added a preface by Miss Jane Ellen 
Harrison, on the relation of Greek vase-painting 
to Greek literature and mythology. Twenty- 
five illustrations, some in color, accompany the 
text. 

In his first chapter M. Pottier briefly dis- 
cusses the importance of the study of Greek 
vases as a means of dimly discerning the nature 
of the pictorial art of classic Greece, and states 
as his reason for selecting Douris as a typical 
exponent of the craft, first, the fact that this 
painter is representative of the culmination of 
the manufacture of Greek pottery; and second, 
that to him can be attributed the largest number 
of vases bearing the name of the painter. 

In the next three chapters, the author tells of 
the social conditions of the vase-painter, gives a 
glimpse into a factory in the Kerameikos, touches 
upon the great pottery industry in Athens, and 
suggests how these skilled craftsmen must have 
been keenly sensitive to the works of art by which 
they were surrounded; describes the workshop 
and tools; and follows step by step the technical 
process of the production of a piece of red- 
figured work. 

In the remaining chapters the author dis- 
cusses the vases of Douris, dividing them, accord- 
ing to the content of the painting, into three 
groups: mythological, martial, and genre, for 
the last of which Douris showed a decided pref- 
erence, introducing us to many an interesting 
everyday scene of contemporary Athenian life. 
In conclusion the writer summarizes in a 
peculiarly happy way the historic and aesthetic 



THE DIAL 



[Decemhr 



value of his painter. In fact, the chief value of 
the book is the charm that results from the 
warmly appreciative and sympathetic attitude of 
M. Pettier toward his subject. 

The translator, however, could have rendered 
the volume more valuable to the student, had 
she added, in footnotes, the results of late criti- 
cism, which, for instance, accredits Douris with 
more work than the twenty-eight pieces men- 
tioned by M. Pettier. 

A different aim is found in Mr. Hoppin's 
monograph, which is a scholarly and more techni- 
cal presentation of the works of a small, but 
closely allied, group led by the painter Euthym- 
ides. The writer arranges his material in the 
form of a catalogue raisonne of the signed works, 
each accompanied by a detailed description, a 
bibliography, and, wherein lies the unusual value 
of this work, an illustration of every vase dis- 
cussed, many of superior quality, as they are 
reproduced from the Furtwangler-Reichhold 
plates. He then effects his reconstruction from 
the following data: (a) signatures and inscrip- 
tions; (b) use of kalos names; (c) relation to 
the other artists of the period; (d) style and 
technical details. His deductions are that histor- 
ically Euthymides was active in the early part 
of the fifth century, had some connection with 
the black-figured work, and with Andokides and 
his group, and was a contemporary and rival of 
Euphronius. Artistically he possessed a well- 
defined style a fact which has been established 
by a morphological study of the figures and a re- 
duction of them to geometric formulae. 

On the hypothesis of this reconstruction, by 
the comparative method, Mr. Hoppin attributes 
to Euthymides ten unsigned vases, arranging his 
data in the same catalogue form as in the case 
of the signed works. 

By a like study of four vases of unquestioned 
signature, the writer determines the historical 
place and style of Phintias, whom he considers 
an intimate associate, if not actual partner, of 
Euthymides. Finally he discusses the more 
shadowy personalities of Kleophrades and Hypsis, 
the former, because of his relation, at the 
beginning of his career, to Euthymides, as a 
probable pupil; and the latter, because of his 
strong Euthymides characteristics. 

Students of the history of art will value Mr. 
Hoppin's monograph not only for its reconstruc- 
tions, but also for its exposition of a method, 
logical and scholarly. HBLBN GARDNHR . 



Another "Apologia" 

A SPDUTUAL PILGRIMAGE. By R. J. Campbell. 
(D. Applcton & Co.) 

This book belongs to the type of intimate 
literature represented earlier by Newman's "Apo- 
logia" and in our own day by the autobiograph- 
ical confessions of Benson and Tyrrell. "It is 
best to tell the whole story of my religious life 
and to let it speak for itself," says Mr. Camp- 
bell. "Most of the arguments on both sides are 
already outworn, ... I have therefore confined 
myself to describing step by step the road by 
which I came to the position I occupy today." 
The vogue of such religious autobiography is 
great, and it is significant. Abstract theology 
may be alien to our generation; philosophical dis- 
cussion always appeals to limited groups. But 
the modern world is hungry for records of expe- 
rience, and the welcome accorded them shows 
that men are still intensely conscious that they 
are "pilgrims of eternity," and crave fellowship 
and guidance on the journey. 

Fellowship rather than guidance is to be found 
in Mr. Campbell's book. The secret of the au- 
thor's power over vast audiences is not hard to 
discover. Such sympathetic eagerness and sweet- 
ness of nature are assets in the pulpit and will 
always win the world. The delightful account 
of the boyhood in Ulster is full of beauty and 
humor, and incidentally throws much light on 
the present psychology of Irish affairs. The lov- 
ing and reverent discipleship toward Dean Pagct 
and other friends, the pleasure in great books, 
for Campbell has been a wide if not a deep 
reader, the authentic note of spiritual experi- 
ence, are charming traits traits of a man so 
lovable that his unknown hearers or readers feel 
at once a personal bond established. 

But these very traits are those of the fellow- 
traveller rather than the leader. The book has 
high representative value ; one finds in it a reflec- 
tion of many characteristic phases in the religious 
experience of England and, in a measure, of Eu- 
rope during the last quarter-century. One does 
not find in it an original contribution to Chris- 
tian thought. There is nothing to compare, for 
instance, with the great concluding chapter of 
the "Apologia" for depth and fervor of thought, 
or for power of expression. Yet change of faith. 
in the cases of both Newman and Campbell, 
sprang really, not out of thought, but out of per- 
sonality. Intellectual as well as spiritual travail 
preceded Mr. Campbell's sincere and deliberate 



1917] 



THE DIAL 



641 



conversion from non-conformity to Anglicanism. 
But those to whom news of that conversion came 
as a surprise will learn now that it was inevita- 
ble. Newman, as a little boy, for some myste- 
rious reason drew rosaries in his schoolbooks and 
crossed himself in the dark. So Campbell, in 
conservative Presbyterian Ulster, where Orange- 
men abounded and contempt for Catholic Ire- 
land dominated emotion, tells us: "I remember 
making for myself an Oratory in a remote cor- 
ner of our woods, and carving a rude crucifix 
for it as well as erecting a rough stone altar. 
Why I did this I cannot imagine, as I am sure 
I never saw anything of the kind anywhere else 
at that time." These things have to be, and it 
is a foolish soul that fights against the call from 
a region below reason. 

Presently we are at Oxford, and the author 
has to record the spell cast over him by the holy 
lives of the priests with whom he was there in 
contact, and by the lofty beauty and mystic im- 
plications of Catholic life and worship. The 
forces which withheld him at that time from the 
Anglican priesthood were partly an honorable 
loyalty to his Presbyterian forbears, and a recog- 
nition of the work of the Spirit within them, 
partly a liberalism which questioned "the author- 
ity on which we accepted Christian doctrine" 
and shrank half consciously from dogmatic de- 
mands. He felt that High Anglicanism led 
straight to Rome. Also, he was "in the mood 
for sacrifice," and "would rather work with 
those who had not social recognition than with 
those who had." Admirable objections, yet all 
the time the spell was at work. "The two 
sources of my spiritual life are the Ulster Pres- 
byterianism of my childhood, and the Anglo- 
Catholicism of my Oxford days. To the latter, 
humanly speaking, I owe my soul." Anyone 
reading the record of those years, though aware 
that it may be somewhat colored by feelings of 
a later date, would be certain that in the end 
nostalgia of the Altar, as Tyrrell used to put it, 
would lead the wanderer home. 

But the home-coming was by a roundabout 
path, and in describing it the book treats of 
nearly all the forces which have swayed modern 
religious minds. Chapter VI, on "The Labor 
Movement," is interesting in its record of a 
growing social radicalism, and noteworthy for 
the gentleness with which its advanced positions 
are maintained. But the dramatic centre of the 
book is in the controversy gathering around the 
New Theology, and in the progress of Campbell's 



mind before and after. That work, written under 
the temporary influence of a Modernist Christol- 
ogy, monistic to the verge of Pantheism, called 
forth, among other comment, a reply from Camp- 
bell's honored leader of old at Oxford, Bishop 
Gore. Rare phenomenon! The author was con- 
vinced by the refutation, or at least was driven 
back to former types of faith, which in the end re- 
sumed their hold. A man who can be brought 
round to his opponent's point of view by that op- 
ponent's attack on him is a real Christian ; and the 
fine humility, as well as the impressionable quality 
of mind which gives book and man their charm, 
is peculiarly evident at this point. The whole 
discussion of modern Christology, moreover, of 
the "Christ-Myth" theory and the Apocalyptic 
conception of Christianity, is lucid and valuable 
to the reader least versed in theological meth- 
ods; nor does the discussion lose cogency from 
the ardent devotional tone which pervades it. 
To be religious, Mr. Campbell keenly says some- 
where in his book, is a gift of nature; to be 
spiritually minded is the work of grace, and 
comes after long effort only. This book is the 
self-revelation of a spiritually minded man who 
knows whereof he speaks. 

Perhaps Mr. Campbell's sanguine temper over- 
estimates the degree to which the modernist 
Christology is now discredited; but he is not 
alone in reaction from it. Younger non-con- 
formists of distinction, as for example Dr. Or- 
chard in his brilliant "Necessity of Christ," are 
also feeling their way back to faith in the his- 
torical and supernatural basis of Christianity, 
as well as toward a Sacramental and Catholic 
philosophy. Once more the ancient sanctities 
have been attacked by the tumultuous roar and 
rush of an incoming tide ; and again as the waves 
recede they stand firm as rocks above the welter. 
In the course of geologic periods, waves wear 
rocks away; but the Rock of Ages shows no 
change as yet to mortal vision. 

Bishop Gore pointed out to Campbell that 
much which repelled him in current Protestant 
orthodoxy was equally repellent to the Catholic 
genius: and insistence that the mystic Christ and 
the Jesus of history are one, led him back into 
the Catholic fold. "It was the Christ of the 
Catholic Church that stood forth from the newer 
criticism of the gospel sources, not the Christ 
of liberal Protestantism." Very gently, with true 
loving-kindness toward all, Campbell returned 
to his old home. Has he reached the end of his 
journey? Every reader asks the question. He

explains that he has carefully studied and re- 
jected the claims of Rome. But a temperament 
like his rarely reaches a passive goal. Mean- 
time, wherever he may find himself, his power 
to contribute to the larger Christian unity which 
begins to seem more than a dream is in many 
ways unique. His treatment of the vexed ques- 
tion of Reordination is especially cogent and 
timely; the direct and practical experience of 
varied religious types, the respect for all, the 
lofty view of the Whole Body, the Sacra- 
mental philosophy, above all the personal piety 
breathing through every page, equip him to 
render greater services to his generation in 
the future than in the past. His autobiography, 
so typical in its very weaknesses, may not give 
much satisfaction to minds ready to penetrate 
new regions; but it does better. It is the reve- 
lation of a true Christian, unspoiled by popu- 
larity, humble, consecrate, and never disobedient 
to his heavenly vision. y roA D SCUDDER. 



The Industrial Revolution 

THE TOWN LABOURER, 1760-1832. By J. L. and 

Barbara Hammond. (Longmans, Green & Co.; 

$3.50.) 

From the point of view of the possessing 
classes, the Industrial Revolution in England 
meant the dawn of modern greatness, the con- 
quest of nature by man's inventive skill, the en- 
dowment of society with a wealth of commodities 
and services. From the point of view of the 
worker who produced these commodities, the In- 
dustrial Revolution was a cruel and shameless 
exploitation of the mass of a race by the classes 
holding economic and political power. The 
modern social historian is far more interested 
in this latter point of view than in the former, 
and presses insistently on these sorest spots of 
English civilization. Never has the story been 
told with such masterly precision or with such 
illuminating reference to the original sources of 
the time as in this book by the Hammonds. It 
is not a large book, but the perspective and 
proportion are so perfect that the life of a whole 
era, analyzed searchingly and profoundly, passes 
before your eyes as you read. 

The book is virtually a study in the technique 
of class-manipulation. Not only are events and 
conflicts studied, but the whole intellectual and 
spiritual background of this class struggle as 
events were reflected in it is presented. This is 



"social" psychology as an intellectual fine art. 
We see not only the cruelly ingenious union of 
capitalism and government for the purpose of 
keeping the working classes in servitude, but we 
see the philosophy by which capitalists and poli- 
ticians rationalized their crude will-to-power into 
attitudes that satisfied them as necessary. The 
Hammonds have used their material with the 
utmost skill to show us the intellectual structure 
of this terrible civilization. In their early chap- 
ters, "The New Power," "The New Town," 
"The New Discipline," they show the inexor- 
able hemming in of the workers by the new 
capitalism. In the later chapters on "The Mind 
of the Rich," "The Conscience of the Rich," 
"The Defences of the Poor," "The Mind of 
the Poor," "The Ambitions of the Poor," the 
authors analyze the states of mind, religious, 
political, predatory, that accompanied the new 
subjugation and the reactions against it. In 
their feeling for class attitudes, for the rational- 
izations that accompany the economic war, for 
the sinister manipulation of government by cap- 
ital, the Hammonds have an intellectual tool 
which should be in the hands of every one who 
tries to write of this modern industrial era. 
And they have produced a book which can fairly 
be called a model of method and perspective. 

The writers are filled with the need of or- 
ganizing a society in which "all men and women 
have an equal and recognized share." The age 
they describe, which still lives on in our Ameri- 
can industrial civilization, thought of industry 
only "as offering rapid and tempting prizes to 
the spirit of gain which was regarded as the 
great motive power of human progress." The 
workingmen leaders who were right then, and 
are right now, saw that "if life was to be en- 
riched by the new industry, machinery must be 
made subordinate to the men who used it." The 
struggle to effect that subordination has still 
after a century scarcely got beyond the first skir- 
mishes. This book reflects the revolutionizing 
of economic thought; it insists that England 
and the other industrial nations by inference 
shall no longer be "two nations," divided by a 
bitter class struggle, but a genuine common- 
wealth in which machinery becomes the servant 
of life and not its master. "The Town La- 
bourer" should be read for its constant play of 
suggest iveness upon our modern situation, and 
the stern questions its material puts to us of 
how much our ruling classes know of liberty

Psychology in a Vacuum 

THE THREE BLACK PENNYS. By Joseph Herge- 
sheimer. (Alfred A. Knopf; $1.50.) 

The publisher of Mr. Hergesheimer's "The 
Three Black Pennys" calls it "the first Ameri- 
can novel" he has printed. There is no need 
to put any special interpretation on that use of 
the word "American," but it comes in neatly as 
a starting-place for a discussion of this "splendid, 
unsuccessful" novel. It is not American. Until 
American business became the world's breakfast 
conversation, the sordidness of getting to work 
by eight o'clock, or an even more vulgarly early 
hour, there to be enslaved until five or six in 
the evening, was kept from the novel-reader's 
delicate sensibilities. One somehow received the 
impression from one's youthful reading that the 
people in novels rarely had to work. They did 
work, it is true; but the hero always dressed for 
dinner, and he could be had for a love scene 
in a shadowy pergola at any hour of the day. 
Even when his work and its influence were the 
theme, the spiritual situation was more likely to 
be presented than the weariness of the hours 
from morning till lunch and from one o'clock 
till five. English and continental literature still 
make one think of the dominant leisure classes, 
though they may be felt only through their 
pressure on the laboring man. America is the 
workaday nation of the world, garish, loud, and 
unrefined. There are almost as many million- 
aires in the United States as the Russian peasant 
believes there are, but it is doubtful whether 
there are many who do not spend a great part 
of their days at a desk. And whether judged 
fairly or not, the millionaire is notoriously bo- 
vine as regards the "finer shades." The work 
of making millions has completely coarsened him. 

The three black Pennys are three men of one 
family, separated by generations but bound by 
a strain of melancholy, "black blood," which 
gives them the appellation. All three are in- 
heritors of the Penny iron mills and wealth. 
This offers what seems to be, and is, a typically 
American background ; but the characters are 
in it and not of it. Gilbert Penny, the founder 
of the iron business and the only one who gives 
his life in true American fashion to its develop- 
ment, is merely the father of the first of the 
three "black" Pennys. His successors are all 
men of complete leisure, of genuine culture and 
wealth, free to do as they please and breathe an 
atmosphere of aristocracy decidedly European. 
All the men and women of the story, indeed, are 



possessed of a refinement that reminds one of 
the people who interested Henry James. The 
iron mills pound, flame, and roar outside, al- 
ways outside, for they are never allowed to come 
into the drawing-room. It is, so to speak, in 
drawing-rooms, softly lighted and faultlessly 
furnished, that all three stories take place. This 
is the impression of the whole work. The au- 
thor himself writes with a subtlety and a sensi- 
tive penetration that are the fruits of careful 
reading, if not study, of English and French 
models. There are none of the bold, bald ob- 
servations of a Spoon River historian. So 
much, then, as a friendly attempt to rid Mr. 
Hergesheimer's novel of a complimentary ad- 
vertisement which it cannot fairly be asked 
to live up to. To say that it is not American, 
is not to derogate the novel. The publisher, 
you know, may have meant by "American," a 
novel written by an American and printed in 
this country! 

Obviously, the adjectives "splendid" and "un- 
successful" were chosen with care. It is un- 
successful, first of all, because it is not a unit. 
It is divided into three parts that are three 
stories. In spite of a liberal and often tiresome, 
though always skilful, use of the mechanics of 
genealogy and inheritance, the reader is wholly 
unconvinced that these men and their stories 
are in any way related. Why the author is not 
successful, despite his clever use of genealogical 
connectives, is too subtle and complex a subject 
to be dealt with in anything less than an essay. 
One is generously tempted to excuse him on the 
grounds that he has attempted one of the most 
difficult feats in fiction, until one remembers the 
impressiveness of "The Way of All Flesh." 
When the first part of the book has been finished, 
and a brilliant piece of work it is, the disappoint- 
ment at discovering that one is to know no 
more of Howat Penny and Ludowika, that one 
has finished a short story, is so discouraging that 
patience must be coaxed to return. Jasper Pen- 
ny's story follows, and it has a hard time indeed 
making a place for itself in the mind of the 
reader who has become fond of Howat, Ludo- 
wika, and the whole first Penny family. But it 
finally does so, because of the author's vivid 
presentation of human psychology. At this stage, 
in fact, forgiveness is the feeling one has, until 
the same experience must be gone through again 
with the third story. It is too much. One de- 
termines to tell everyone, including the author, 
that this is not a novel, but three short stories.

THE DIAL 



[December 20 



Contributing also to the ultimate failure of 
the work as a novel is a smaller flaw, a flaw, 
however, that is cumulative in its effect upon 
the reader who likes Mr. Hergesheimer's people. 
This flaw has been mentioned. The characters 
move in the setting as though it were a mere 
stage back-drop. It might even be said that 
they move hither and thither through it with 
no more effect upon themselves than if it were 
air and mist. At first the reader's feeling is too 
vague to be called even a suspicion. Little by 
little he finds that these people really live in an 
abstract world, that they could be taken from 
their setting without changing their fates in 
the least. Not one of the Penny men is really 
affected by the iron mills; the wealth that affects 
them comes from the mills, but the money might 
have been inherited from perfect strangers and 
their stories would have been the same. This 
independence of the atmosphere of the surround- 
ings extends even to the weather. The moods, 
the thoughts, the spirits of the various char- 
acters are in no way changed by those minute 
influences which make up so large a part of the 
mosaic of life. Memories of the exquisite blend- 
ing of man and nature by such men as Mere- 
dith, Maupassant, and Flaubert flood into the 
reviewer's mind. 

The virtue of the book is its psychology, its 
delineation of the minds and souls of these peo- 
ple. For this it deserves the adjective "splen- 
did." And lest the reader of the review be un- 
desirably biased by a comparison of the space 
devoted to praise and blame, let me say un- 
equivocally that the book is worth reading. One 
hands it on immediately to one's best friend, and 
gives the friend full permission to do the same. 
Every person in the book lives, lives in his or 
her small time with an attraction not incom- 
parable to that of some of the great characters 
in fiction. At times you forget the words and 
paper, you sympathize to the point of embarrass- 
ment. This is no small accomplishment for a 
writer, and it is Mr. Hergesheimer's. There 
are flaws, but one of them is not false or super- 
ficial psychology. You are surprised not by what 
the people say, but by the fact that they say just 
what they should say. They react in normal, 
vivid, vital ways. In the world of fiction-pup- 
pets such individuals stand out with all the at- 
traction of personalities. It is because his people 
are so "splendid" that one must call the novel 
unsuccessful. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS 

ARIZONA THE WONDERLAND. By George 

Wharton James. Page ; $3.50. 

Arizona's signal claim to publicity has rested 
these many years solely on the Grand Canyon. 
We learn from the book before us that it can 
boast of other wonders of nature. George 
Wharton James's self-imposed, and not altogether 
unsuccessful, task is to establish the truth of his 
statement that "With but one exception the 
ocean Arizona has everything that has rendered 
California so world-famed, with the addition of 
many scenic, geologic, ethnologic, and archeologic 
features that California does not possess." It 
would seem that Mr. James knows his Arizona 
as well as the California of which he has written 
so much, for in defence of his enthusiasm he 
says: "Of course I shall be accused of 'fine writ- 
ing.' I always am, by men who have not seen 
what I am writing about. How foolish for those 
who know not to criticize the endeavors of those 
who do." 

Too bulky for a guide book, too discursive for 
quick reference, the work nevertheless makes 
pleasant and often informative reading. After 
"Glimpses of the Land," in which the reader is 
taken in imagination on a sketchy trip over the 
whole state, the remainder of the book satisfies the 
curiosity thus aroused by developing more inten- 
sively the subjects enumerated. Of especial inter- 
est are the facts relating to the various tribes of 
Indians, among whom the author has spent much 
time, studying their ceremonies, their ways of 
living, and their histories. He concludes that the 
ancient cliff-dwellers are to be identified with 
the present-day Pueblo Indians. We learn of the 
existence of ruins that do not come within the ken 
of any but the specialist ; one of them, Betatakin, 
with Nonnezoshie, a great natural arch rising 
above it, was seen for the first time by a white 
man in 1909. In the White Mountains, the 
author says, new dwellings are often brought to 
light, and there are still many that have yet to 
be discovered. 

The industrial and intellectual phases of Ari- 
zona life are also recorded, so that the book is 
comprehensive in its scope. It is likewise a well- 
furnished volume, illustrated with a dozen color- 
plates besides many other pictures and a map. 

POLITICS AND PERSON Ai.rriES. By the Right 
Hon. G. W. E. Russell. Scribner; $2.25. 
The book itself is thoroughly engaging. It is 
one of those comfortable books which one can 
take up at odd moments with the assurance that 
they will prove good moments a book genial 
without loss of seriousness, thoughtful without 
being profound, and (grateful virtue) contempo- 
rary without being harrowing. The politics that 



1917] 



THE DIAL

Mr. Russell is concerned with is current English 
politics, the personalities are mostly present-day 
political personalities both judged from the van- 
tage of a man read in history and reared in the 
society of the high Victorians. Everywhere the 
author is sure-tempered ; everywhere he is shrewd 
and humane; everywhere he sees Britishly. His 
analysis of the duties of representatives, where 
conscience and constituency are at odds ("M. P. 
or Delegate?") ; his reasoned assertion of the 
political influence of the British monarch ("The 
Whigs and the Constitution") ; his characteriza- 
tion of John Bull as a type that is passing ("John 
Bull in Ireland") these are samples of topics 
that exact attention; and with them such judg- 
ments as, "England remains the most religious 
country in Europe"; "the true spring of oratory 
is the old Holy Well of Romance" said, con- 
cerning "Demagogues," with Lloyd George in 
the category; or, "the pitifullest and meanest 
outcry which can be uttered is the outcry of the 
well-to-do classes against expenditure on the 
instruction of the poor." 

But, after all, it is not the book, it is the author 
that stirs the imagination. Is he, as a type, 
doomed to pass along with old John Bull? The 
propertied Liberal, political both by nature and 
opportunity; the aristocrat, unostentatious but 
family-conscious; the Oxford man, who moves 
in the classics without apparatus and remembers 
Jowett; the churchman, familiar with the prob- 
lems of the mind and capable of setting his own 
intelligent appraisal upon the thing we call sci- 
ence ("The Dark Side of Science") combine 
such qualities with humor and humanity, honor 
and chivalry, all sanely proportioned, and you 
will limn such a portrait as Mr. Russell all 
unconsciously draws of himself in his essays, rich 
in reminiscence but awake to the present hour. 
No one need expect to find in "Politics and Per- 
sonalities" solutions for the great political prob- 
lems of the near future, nor are they likely to be 
solved by men of its author's type: the times are 
cataclysmic, and experience cast in Victorian 
moulds cannot be their measure. But it is not 
the least poignant of our qualms to fear lest the 
cataclysm shall have swept from the future the 
possibility of perpetuating this same fine type of 
the political man. 

DAYS OF DESTINY. By R. Gorell Barnes. 

Longmans, Green; $1. 

Another book of war verse comes from a young 
author, now member of the Rifle Brigade. It is 
written by following, unconsciously perhaps, the 
familiar patterns. In ordinary orderly metrical 
rhymes the writer celebrates "The Path of Hon- 
our," "The Cliffs of England," "The Fall of 
Namur." The verse is neither beautiful nor 
poor ; it is merely commonplace. There are no 



arresting visions, no thrilling beauties, no stirring 
agonies. It is true that the finest poetry in the 
world deals with the oldest things in the world. 
The dreadfulness of war, the dearness of home, 
the glory of a goal seen through a mist of blood 
and tears, these are close enough to men's hearts 
to be at the root of poetry. But neither good 
subject-matter nor the will to self-expression, 
alone or together, can create art. And that inti- 
mate wedding of the sensitive and the communi- 
cative which results in fine art can occur even 
when the form is as old as iambic tetrameter. 
For all this versifier's sentiments, he has no pas- 
sions. He expresses in traditional way tradi- 
tional feelings. His is neither the wilfulness of 
original emotion nor the unique significance of 
an original manner. Indeed, he lacks even the 
tradition of his tradition: the note of Tenny- 
sonian lyrism. 

LETTERS ABOUT SHELLEY. Interchanged 
by Three Friends Edward Dowden, Rich- 
ard Garnett, and William Michael Rossetti. 
Edited, with an Introduction, by R. S. Gar- 
nett. Doran; $2. 

"Writing maketh an exact man," says Bacon. 
Behind any good biography or any carefully 
established text is hidden an amount of labor on 
minutiae that is both amazing and depressing. 
Yet this scholarly research need not be dryasdust ; 
it may be accompanied by noble enthusiasm and 
the spirit of unselfish sacrifice. Both the toil and 
the generosity of scholars are illustrated in the 
volume which Mr. R. S. Garnett has edited. 
The book is valuable, besides, to lovers of Shelley. 
It comprises the greater part of the correspond- 
ence of three notable authorities on the poet, pre- 
sents their discussions in detail from 1869 to 
1906, and reflects the broad-minded interest of 
each in literature and life in general. Of the 
three, Richard Garnett was first to win recog- 
nition as an authority on Shelley. He hoped 
some day to write the poet's biography; but 
crowded with duties at the British Museum, and 
drawn by the force of circumstances into other 
literary undertakings, he never found the neces- 
sary leisure. To him Rossetti, himself become 
known for painstaking research, presently applied 
for assistance in a memoir. So unstinted was the 
response that a firm friendship between the two 
men resulted. After a time Rossetti called Gar- 
nett's attention to "a Whitman enthusiast 
Edward Dowden." Before long Dowden in turn 
was studying Shelley and corresponding with 
Garnett about a multitude of details. Sir Percy 
Shelley, now hopeless of securing Garnett's serv- 
ices, invited Dowden to write the official biogra- 
phy. The invitation was accepted; still more 
rigorous investigation was made necessary, and 
an intensified correspondence between Dowden

and Garnett was begun. The letters of this period 
are the most valuable of the collection. They 
offer no sweeping revelations about Shelley, for 
the sufficient reason that their discoveries have 
already been embodied in published works. But 
their arguments pro and con and their numerous 
citations of elusive evidence make them useful 
for reference. The most important general fact 
to be elicited from them is that of Dowden's 
independence of the poet's family. It has been 
supposed that he deferred too much to Sir Percy 
Shelley. These letters show clearly that he fol- 
lowed his own opinion in essentials, though at 
times he softened mere expressions, and was 
always open to suggestions from the magnani- 
mous Garnett. 

THE PACIFIC OCEAN IN HISTORY. Edited 

by H. Morse Stephens and Herbert E. Bol- 

ton. Macmillan; $4. 

Among the meetings held at the Panama- 
Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco 
in 1915 was that of the Panama Pacific Histori- 
cal Congress. This volume, "The Pacific Ocean 
in History," contains a record of that congress, 
and in title indicates the scope of the historical 
interests represented. Edited by H. Morse 
Stephens and Herbert E. Bolton, the work is 
assured the careful attention of scholars, par- 
ticularly when each finds included under the 
comprehensive but vague appellation papers in his 
own special field. There are twenty-four papers 
upon subjects more or less remotely connected 
with the "Pacific Ocean Area." They are divided 
into six sections, ( 1 ) "The Philippine Islands 
and their History as a Part of the History of 
the Pacific Ocean Area," (2) "The Northwest- 
ern States, British Columbia, and Alaska in 
their Relation with the Pacific Ocean," (3) 
Spanish-America and the Pacific Ocean," (4) 
"California," (5) "New Mexico and Arizona," 
and (6) "Japan and Australasia." Indicative of 
the range of the papers read in these sections 
may be cited "The Western Ocean as a Deter- 
minant in Oregon History," "British Influence 
in Mexico, 1822-26," "French Intrusions in New 
Mexico, 1749," and "Japan's Early Attempts to 
Establish Commercial Relations with Mexico." 
Ten of the papers are by representatives of the 
University of California, and fourteen are in the 
field of Spanish-American history. The volume 
is largely a University of California product, the 
result of the combined energies of Professor 
Stephens in his managerial capacity and of Pro- 
fessor Bolton in his remarkably productive sem- 
inary. 

Much of the book is not of interest to the 
layman. But this is not true of the opening ad- 
dress of Professor Stephens, in which he dis- 
courses upon the conflict of European Nations in 



the Pacific. His wide view of international re- 
lations of the past four hundred years may well 
enlarge the horizon of many a casual reader. A 
brief but careful survey of California history 
down to 1850 is included, and Horace Davis 
contributes a paper on the "Home Guard" of 
1861. 

THE CAMBRIDGE HISTORY OF AMERICAN 

LITERATURE. Vol. I. Edited by William 

Peterfield Trent, John Erskine, Stuart P. 

Sherman, and Carl Van Doren. Putnam; 

$3.50. 

This work, the first volume of which is just 
issued, purposes doing for American literature in 
three volumes what the Cambridge History of 
English Literature has done for the older coun- 
try in fourteen. The editors believe that to write 
the intellectual history of America from the mod- 
ern aesthetic standpoint would be to miss precisely 
what makes it significant among modern liter- 
atures. A people that devoted its main energies 
to exploration, settlement, labor for sustenance, 
religion, and statecraft had no time and no 
disposition to pursue art for art's sake. Yet 
conditions which operated unfavorably for the 
development of poetry and fiction were "no seri- 
ous handicap to the production of a prose com- 
petently recording their practical activities and 
expressing their moral, religious, and political 
ideas." This view once adopted, the work of 
Jonathan Edwards is indeed worth more than 
some imitative didactic poem in heroic couplets, 
and "The Federalist" of more account than con- 
temporary attempts at novel-writing. The pres- 
ent volume, therefore, is largely taken up by the 
theologians and political writers of the eighteenth 
century though there is an opening chapter on 
early travellers and explorers. This part of the 
volume has also a fine, upstanding chapter on 
Franklin, by Professor Sherman, of Urbnm. 
Later on, due attention is bestowed upon Irving. 
Cooper, Bryant, and Emerson, the latter section 
being handled by Paul Elmer More. A chapter 
on transcendentalism, introducing this, is by Pro- 
fessor Goddard, of Swarthmore College. It is 
one of the best pieces of work in the volume, but 
its title, curiously enough, is omitted from the 
table of contents. There are also pages on the 
early essayists, dramatists, poets, and historians 
who were, of course, mostly imitative echoes from 
the days of Queen Anne. 

Of the 584 pages of the volume, 200 are taken 
up by a laborious bibliography. Now that the 
foundations of the history are laid, perhaps the 
superstructure will exhibit a lighter and more 
attractive aspect. One would welcome a smaller 
measure of compilation and a larger manifesta- 
tion of the critical and the appreciatory.

ox NEW FICTION 



The republf cation of Mr. E. W. Howe's 
"Story of a Country Town" (Harper; $1.50) 
will call the attention of many people perhaps 
for the first time to what is undoubtedly one 
of the most remarkable novels ever written in 
this country. Composed thirty-five years ago, 
in the spare moments of a lonely Kansas editor's 
life, the book has had a continuous circulation, 
though with a curiously submerged reputation. 
It somehow never got itself into the canon of 
American classics, to which it so rightfully be- 
longs. Perhaps this is because it defies all the 
laws of what is generally supposed to be congenial 
to the American imagination. It is austere and 
slightly ironic in tone; it pictures a stagnant and 
more or less defeated pioneer count^side ; it has 
no trace of moralism; and it is distinctly pessi- 
mistic in its outlook. There is nowhere the 
popular American theme of redemption. The 
incredibly pathetic and tragic story of Jo Ewing 
moves to its dramatic close without the allevia- 
tion of sentimentality. There is about the book 
a good deal of the remorseless fate that we feel 
in the "Spoon River Anthology." This young 
novelist pierced through the layers of optimism 
and mawkishness that popular writers are apt 
to smother American life in, and told the cold 
and arid truth about his environment as he saw 
it. It is a realism colored by a pale romantic 
glow, and by a singularly sustained mood of 
resignation. This story suggests nothing but 
itself. The names of some of the characters 
suggest an allegorical intention, but the allegory 
is not insistent. The plot has an intensity of 
feeling and an almost classic contour that one 
associates with no other American novel. The 
style is extraordinarily simple, flowing, and vigor- 
ous, perfectly adapted to the primitive emotional 
life and relations it describes. The touching 
naivete of the narration brings out all of these 
qualities. There is hardly anything about the 
book that is not an anomaly. Strangest of all 
perhaps is the fact that the story was much 
appreciated by the American reviewers when it 
came out, and the first edition, as Mr. Howells 
reports in his preface, was sold out in the very 
community where the story was produced and 
about which it was written. Its renaissance now 
is a fortunate event. 

The sentimentality in which the novelist 
clothes the woman who has broken convention is 
nowadays as conventionally inevitable as the 
actual attitude toward her in real life. Emerson 
Hough in "The Broken Gate" (Appleton; 
$1.50) does not deviate from that narrow path 
of fictional possibility. The mother of Don Lane, 
instead of leaving the town where she was 
known, bravely lived there, as a milliner, for 



twenty years, while she supported the son she 
had sent away from her. It is a fine opportunity 
for pathos, and the author may be counted on 
to make the most of it. 

In "The Youth Plupy, or The Lad with a 
Downy Chin" (Houghton Mifflin; $1.35), 
Henry A. Shute records the further adventures, 
chiefly amatory, of the hero-author of "The Real 
Diary of a Real Boy." Whether considered as 
a study of adolescence, as a story about boys for 
grown-ups, as a book of delicious humor, or as 
so much additional information about that com- 
pellingly interesting lad, Plupy, this episodical 
narrative, which reaches its climax in a pair of 
good old-fashioned fist-fights, is capital reading 
first-class for the fag-end of a weary day. 

"The Love Letters of St. John" (Kennerley; 
$1.25), forty-seven in number, subjectively re- 
late the suppositive love story of the Apostle 
John and Antione, one of the Greek hetaerae. 
The burden of St. John's communications is 
that "the Word that he spake unto us, the God 
that he showed and declared unto us, is only 
Love. There is no other power and this is the 
life of every living thing. It is the Word that 
was made flesh and dwelt among us. It is the 
bread of life, the only door into the Sheepfold, 
the only rock on which to build, the only way 
of salvation for the world . . ." Antione's 
replies sigh for the vanished "fragrance of that 
wondrous hour" of love. Obviously, the Apostle 
is constantly talking about the love that is of the 
Father, while Antione speaks of love only in 
terms of the flesh. It is not surprising, there- 
fore, that the liaison ends in tragedy, which John 
attempts to ameliorate by sardonically assuring 
Xenia, the love-child of Antione and a former 
paramour, that "greater love hath no man than 
this, that he lay down his life for those who are 
only his friends." The follower of Dionysus 
will find little in the volume to take seriously. 

The obvious and the sentimental are well dis- 
guised in "The Inner Door," by Alan Sullivan 
(Century; $1.35). The sincerity of the author 
is one factor in the disguise, his fair characteriza- 
tion and his utilization of the subjects of the 
day are others. They are likely to carry the 
reader along on a high tide of interested accep- 
tance. But if one considers his story carefully, 
the fact becomes clear that he has presented only 
the more obvious questions in the conflict between 
labor and capital, the more obvious conflict be- 
tween real and fancied romance in the heart of 
his hero, and that he has thrown about them a 
sentimental glamour that no amount of force- 
ful writing can conceal. The book is a good 
example of the so-called better type of American 
novel with which the general reading public is 
wont to satisfy itself.

CASUAL. COMMENT 

THOSE WHO READ ONLY THE HEADLINES AND 
THE EDITORIAL COMMENT in the daily press must 
have got a singularly inadequate notion of the 
President's message to Congress. As usual, the 
editors took considerable pains to veil as far as 
possible Mr. Wilson's incorrigible idealism, which 
they appear to regard as an inexplicable bias to 
be tolerated rather than a programme to be 
adopted. In particular, they fear anything like 
a candid and specific statement of what we expect 
to win by the war, and the whole of the Presi- 
dent's clear and frank sketching of our construc- 
tive purpose was generally ignored as irrelevant 
and premature if not visionary and that, too, 
in spite of his home thrust about Russia, whose 
present plight is a standing reproach to Allied 
statesmanship. What could more convincingly 
show the costliness of an evasive and doubtful 
attitude to the fundamental issues of the war than 
the loss of Russia's effective cooperation and the 
alienation of her sympathy? If suspicion could 
have been allayed by plain speech and a policy 
outlined that was untainted by self-seeking and 
purely nationalistic ambitions, the President 
believes that the present chaos might have been 
averted. At least there was a chance, of which 
a flexible statesmanship, awake to the strategic 
value of candor in dealing with democratic 
masses, would have hastened to avail itself. The 
President's stressing of this point and his feeling 
that, in spite of the apathy of the press, he has 
the support of plain men in his hopes for a peace 
based on give and take, a peace which cannot be 
established without concessions on the part of the 
victors as well as the vanquished, show once more 
his gift for interpreting the real national will. 



IN CHRISTIAN COUNTRIES, for more centuries 
than it is heartening to count, the barometer of 
social liberalism has been the position of the 
Jews. The treatment of this people has become 
the gauge of social progress since the exclusion 
of Jews from the common life of Europe in the 
fourth century. Step by step they have gained 
entrance again into the comity of nations, and 
their advance has kept pace with the growth of 
freedom among the Christian peoples themselves. 
The test of the French Revolution's "rights of 
man" was the rights of the individual Jew ; and 
in the last century western Europe has gradually 
met and passed the test. The test of the Russian 
revolution will be in a measure the same. If it is 
passed, the individual Jew will practically every- 
where be a citizen. Above individual rights, 
however, stand national rights. International 
democracy, the rights of nations great or small, 
can be, perhaps must be, measured by the recogni- 



tion bestowed on the Jewish nation. It is, there- 
fore, a source of gratification to all liberals that 
the British government has pledged its support to 
the "establishment in Palestine of a national 
homeland for the Jewish people." After two 
thousand years of exile not only from his own 
land but from the community of nations as well. 
the Jew is given the encouragement of recogni- 
tion. The sincerity of liberalism is certified. The 
world could reap no greater reward for granting 
the Jew opportunity to develop his culture freely 
than the gift of that culture itself. In this serv- 
ice lies the responsibility of the Jewish people, 
in Palestine and elsewhere. 



THE "CASE" OF NIETZSCHE continues to oc- 
cupy the Paris reviews. Obviously, it would 
be naive to link him with Bernhardi, Treitschke, 
and the other howling dervishes of the "Deutsch- 
land iiber Alles" cult. He shared their hopes no 
more than their illusions as to the German mis- 
sion; on the contrary', he was a "good European," 
who saw in that nevrose nationale which fas- 
tened itself on his countrymen after the Franco- 
Prussian War only the sacrifice of the German 
mind to the German Empire and the impending 
death of culture. Nothing more easily reused 
his fury than the religion of nationalism. For 
the petty state system which has to plant itself 
"between two hatreds" to keep from collapsing, 
he had nothing but scorn, and he was filled with 
the holy rage of the philosopher in the presence 
of all the fatuities and follies that accompanied 
the growth of the national vanity in Germany. 
Small danger of his mistaking the joyous Junkers 
for Overmen. There is, in fact, an exquisite 
irony in the fact that the writings of this fas- 
tidious and perverse solitary should have played 
their part in helping to spread a culture which 
he loathed as the very negation of spiritual 
values, as something heavy and uninspired, a 
grotesque mingling of tasteless borrowings and 
bungling imitation. He prided himself most 
on remaining an alien among the German people 
and carrying his admirations elsewhere chiefly 
to France. He even turned the Germans he 
admired into foreigners in order to admire them 
comfortably. Wagner is a case in point; Wag- 
ner the "opposite and the incarnate contradic- 
tion of all 'German virtues.' " In the French 
he saw the only modern people who had pro- 
duced a genuine culture, and in the last book he 
wrote he was betrayed into ludicrous excesses of 
praise for the French genius. These, to be sure, 
were the lengthening shadows of the sunset ; but 
they were extensions rather than deflections of 
his lifelong bias, which showed a constantly 
growing exasperation with the German mind and 
a derisive amusement at the antics of the "poor

bear" attempting to dance to the tune of civiliza- 
tion. The French are certainly right to feel that 
they cannot afford to throw Nietzsche over; he 
is the most fanatical modern spokesman for their 
culture. And as for the Germans, if they are 
able to read a flattering account of their national 
aspirations into the works of Nietzsche, then 
Nietzsche is right in his valuation of the German 
mind. 



SINCE THE EFFORTS OF THE ENERGETIC MR. 

HEARST to make literature hum among us have 
been crowned with complete success, what could 
be more remarkable than the humility with 
which he views his triumphs? He gives no evi- 
dence of elation, much less of surprise. His 
formula for success is simplicity itself, as he 
admits in the case of one of his most popular 
magazines. It is to establish an honorable monop- 
oly of "the luminous figure of every man or 
woman in the world who has attained the apex 
of artistic achievement. . . The singers and the 
poets and the philosophers, the dreamers and 
the doers who have reached the mountain 
height. The goodly company of rare spirits 
whom all the world recognizes for their rarity." 
To make the best also the most popular is a prob- 
lem that has worried sociologists, but it does not 
worry Mr. Hearst. His simple, democratic faith 
allows him to reverse the formula and establish 
popularity as the true criterion of the best. 



THE FEAR OF LIBRARIES is becoming one of 
the commonest forms of modern neurosis. Even 
casual readers are likely to have a touch of it, 
though it may amount to nothing more than an 
occasional shudder in the presence of mountain- 
ous heaps of books which they have never read 
and never hope to read. After wandering for 
half an hour among the stacks, they will be 
seized by paralysis of the will and rush into the 
open air to escape the necessity of making a 
choice. But the chief sufferer is the specialist, 
since he is constantly browbeaten not by books 
alone, but by magazines and reviews as well. 
His learning may be prodigious ; he may have ab- 
sorbed whole libraries; but if he has missed the 
newest pamphlet or overlooked the latest book- 
review, he is no longer abreast of his subject. 
It is a fear capable of robbing him of all courage 
and peace of mind, and the resulting irritation is 
likely to disturb the peace of his family. The re- 
volt of the futurists and the vorticists is partly 
an attempt to escape from the neurosis of 
libraries and museums and to vindicate the right 
to life and the pursuit of happiness of even an 
ignorant ego. It is a reaching out for liberty, 
and however grotesque the means may seem, the 
impulse itself is sacred.

14 illustration* and a map. Cloth. $1.50 net. 

This ia a Different Kind of War Book 

This is a different kind of war book bat one of 
the utmost importance by an authority on Eastern 
civilization. Professor Jastrow takes up a subject 
that has not been covered in the war literature of 
today. The story of the Bagdad Highway is roman- 
tic and fascinating. The possession of it has always 
determined the fate of the East. Europe is fighting 
for its control today just as the Persians, Romans, 
Greeks, Arabs, and Turks fought for it in the past. 
To understand its importance and the relation it 
bean to our civilisation is to understand one of the 
underlying cause* of the war, and one to which the 
utmost consideration most be given at the Peace 
Settlement. Professor J astro w's prophetic look into 
the future will be of intense interest to serious stu- 
dents of the problems of the war. No less important 
and thrilling is the story of Asia Minor, here told 
in the author's lucid style from ancient days to our 
time. The history of the region illuminates the 
world wide significance of the railway. The care- 
fully selected illustrations are a feature, as to also 
the comprehensive map of the Near East, in which

NOTBS AWD NEWS 

The index to the current volume is now ready 
and will be sent post paid to those readers who 
wish to receive it, provided they will send in their 
request within thirty days. This index is included 
in the library copies of THB DIAL, but it is the 
publisher's impression that few others will be 
interested in receiving an index and he feels justified 
in saving white paper under existing conditions. 

Contributors to the present issue: 

Richard Ofrner has had the advantage of close 
association with the work of Bernhard Berenson. 
He is at present giving courses on the history of art 
at the University of Chicago. 

Amy Wellington is a young New York critic and 
journalist who was formerly on the staff of "Cur- 
rent Opinion." 

Rose Henderson is a resident of Silver City, 
New Mexico. 

Louis Untermeyer is known as a writer both of 
verse and criticism. He is the author of "The 
Younger Quire," "First Love," and "Challenge." 

Helen Gardner is a lecturer on art at the Uni- 
versity of Chicago. 

Among Vida D. Scudder's numerous works are 
"Socialism and Character," "A Listener in Babel," 
and "Social Ideals in English Letters." 

B. I. Kinne is a member of the department of 
Romance Languages at the University of Wis- 
consin. 



Appletons have just published a community 
masque from the pen of Percy Mackaye entitled 
"The Evergreen Tree." 

Little, Brown & Company announce that Marga- 
ret Sherwood's novel of the war, "The Worn Door- 
step," has now reached its fifteenth printing. 

Joseph Pennell's pictures of war work, which are 
now touring the American art galleries, will shortly 
be published by the J. B. Lippincott Company. 

The Brick Row Bookshop of New Haven has 
just issued an attractive little catalogue containing 
a selected list of first editions of contemporary 
writers. 

Messrs. Frederick A. Stokes and Company 
announce for early January publication a new 
novel by Gertrude Atherton entitled "The White 
Morning," and also a novel by Flora A. Steel enti- 
tled "Mistress of Men." Other publications will 
include Cathal O'Byrnc's "The Grey Feet of the 
Wind." 

"The Book of the West Indies," by Hyatt Ver- 
rill, which Messrs. E. P. Dutton have just brought 
out, offers rather a complete guide to a section of 
the Western Hemisphere which the author feels is 
too little appreciated by Americans. The book is 
the result of several years' residence and explora- 
tion in the islands. 

The John C. Winston Company, of Philadelphia, 
announces that it will enter the school-book field 
on the first of January. For several years this com- 
pany has been preparing a series of text-books under 
the editorship of Dr. William Dodge Lewis, prin- 
cipal of the William Penn High School, of Phila-

delphia. James G. Stradling, for many years con- 
nected with The American Book Company, will be 
the Sales Manager of this new Educational Depart- 
ment. Among the publications announced for Janu- 
ary first are: A Series of Readers, by Sidney G. 
Firman and Ethel H. Maltby; The Young Ameri- 
can Readers, by Jane Eayre Fryer; A Series of 
Community Civics, including "Our Community," 
by Samuel H. Ziegler; "Our Neighborhood," by 
John F. Smith; "Citizenship in Philadelphia," by 
Dr. J. Lynn Barnard. 

Two books of interest to those who have visited 
the Orient are Alfred M. Hitchcock's "Over Japan 
Way" and Alice Tisdale's "Pioneering Where the 
World is Old," both recently from the press of 
Henry Holt and Company. 

The house in New York in which Ridgely Tor- 
rence, author of "Granny Maumee" (Macmillan), 
is now living is rich with literary associations. It 
was here that William Vaughn Moody lived from 
1906 until 1909, and at various times Percy Mac- 
kaye, Vachel Lindsay, Edwin Arlington Robinson, 
Padraic Colum, and Rabindranath Tagore have 
occupied quarters in the same building, which stands 
on Waverly Place, just off Washington Square. 

Ensign Wilbur Bassett of the United States Navy 
is the author of "Wanderships," which has just been 
published by the Open Court Company. In this 
volume he has collected many interesting folk-sto- 
ries of the sea, with notes upon their origin. 

Those interested in the Irish renaissance will wel- 
come the news of the establishment in Dublin of 
The Talbot Press, which will be devoted entirely 
to the publication of the works of Irish writers, 
attention being paid to the format. The new press 
is under the direction of Mr. W. G. Lyon, who has 
chosen as his American adviser Mr. Ernest A. 
Boyd. Mr. Lyon writes us that the political unrest 
of Ireland seems to have stirred a large amount 
of dormant literary ability and that almost daily 
manuscripts are being received which are of more 
than ordinary merit. Among the titles announced 
in their attractive catalogue are: "Appreciations 
and Depreciations" by Ernest A. Boyd; "Anglo- 
Irish Essays" by John Eglinton; "French Literary 
Studies" by Professor T. B. Rudmose-Brown; "Lit- 
erature in Ireland" by Thomas MacDonagh;
