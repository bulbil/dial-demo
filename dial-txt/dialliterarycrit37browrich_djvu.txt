STORIES OF REAL AMERICANS 

in which the Adventures^ Descriptions^ and Characters are all taken from 

TRUE LIFE 



A TEXAS MATCHMAKER 

By ANDY ADAMS 
" This story has the same force and evidences of accuracy that made his " Log " so striking and popular, and 
in addition to the realistic picture of the cowboy and the daily routine of his life, there runs through it all an 
interesting tale of his experience in love." — Boston Transcript. Crown 8vo, $1.50. 

Illustrated by E. Boyd Smith. 

THE PENOBSCOT MAN 

By FANNIE HARDY ECKSTORM 
" Seldom has a type been more sympathetically presented than the Maine river man in these stories. They 
impress one as actualities — almost too hard and grim, but for the relief of a quiet humor and charming 
descriptions of the woods and waterways." — The Outlook. With Frontispiece. 12mo, $1.25. 

THE LAND OF LITTLE RAIN 

By MARY AUSTIN 
" Her portrayal of character, whether of miner, Indian squaw, or greaser, is as notable for pathos and quiet 
humor as for its intimate appreciation of the spirit of their lives." — Indianapolis Sentinel. 8vo, $2.00, net. 

Illustrated by E. Boyd Smith. Postage, 24 cts. 

THE LOG OF A COWBOY 

By ANDY ADAMS 
" Andy Adams has become a public benefactor in that he has preserved a record of a phase of American life 
that is already past, and which was shared by not another man capable of describing it in the same satisfactory 
fashion." — San Francisco Bulletin. Crown 8vo, $1.50. 

Illustrated by E. Boyd Smith. 

TWO TIMELY HISTORICAL VOLUMES 

A Collection of Facts and Documents Relative to the Death of Major-General 

ALEXANDER HAMILTON 

With Comments : together with the various Orations, Sermons, and Eulogies that have been written on his Life

Now reprinted to commemorate the anniversary of his death, which occurs July 12, 1904. Four handred 
numbered copies, handsomely printed and bound in cloth with paper label, are now offered at $4.50, net, per copy. 

Documents Relating to the Purchase and Exploration of Louisiana 

I. The Limits and Bounds of Louisiana. By Thomas Jefferson. 

n. The Exploration of the Bed, the Black, and the Washita Rivers. By William Dunbar. 
The edition in one octavo volume, printed on unbleached rag paper and bound uncut in smooth dark English 
cloth, with paper label, will be strictly limited to five hundred and thirty numbered copies, of which five hundred

GEORGE SAND. 



The early days of this month are marked by 
two literary centenaries which will not be al- 
lowed to pass without appropriate commemora- 
tion. Nathaniel Hawthorne was born a hun- 
dred years ago, on the birthday of our existence 
as a nation; and on the day following, in the 
first year of the Napoleonic Empire, a French 
child was born to whom was given the name 
of Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin. This name 
means little to the consciousness of the general 
reader, and hardly more is meant by the title 
of Baronne de Dudevant, the name which that 
child was to assume upon the day of her mar- 
riage at the age of eighteen. But the whole 
world knows the name of George Sand, under 
which, ten years later, this woman published 
the first of the long series of works of fiction 
that for more than half a century following 
were to flow from her facile pen. The two cen- 
tenaries — American and French — now at 
hand might afford the literary moralist occasion 
for an instructive comparison between our own 
American romancer and the 

' Large-brained woman and large-hearted man ' 

of Mrs. Broiwning's characterization, between the 
spirit of New England Puritanism incarnate in 
the one and the more human gospel of Rousseau 
made eloquent for a later age by the other. But 
we disclaim this ambitious task, and essay the 
simple one of recording a few impressions 
evoked by the memory of one of the two writers, 
choosing the Frenchwoman for our subject be- 
cause she seems less likely than our own Haw- 
thorne to be recalled to the recollection of the 
American reader. 

When Matthew Arnold heard of the death of 
George Sand in 1876, he wrote to his daughter 
as follows : ' Her death has been much in my 
mind; she was the greatest spirit in our Euro- 
pean world from the time that Goethe departed. 
With all her faults and Frenchism, she was 
this.' So pronounced an opinion from so 
weighty an authority, certainly gives us food 
for reflection. Some will probably dismiss the 
dictum as one of those unaccountable vagaries 
which the great critic occasionally permitted 
himself, others will hold it lightly as the un- 
guarded saying of a man not writing for pub- 
lication, and most will agree that it has in it 
some element of exaggeration. But making all 



THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



reasonable allowances for its circumstances and 
its subjective character, it still remains an im- 
pressive saying, and we must remember also 
that a year later Matthew Arnold put himself 
deliberately on record to much the same effect 
in one of his carefully-wrought essays in liter- 
ary criticism. 

This high estimate, moreover, has found sup- 
port in the words of a long line of George 
Sand's contemporaries and successors. From 
writers so different in temper as Mill and 
Mazzini came substantially the same tribute to 
the beauty of her style and the nobility of her 
thought. Frederic Myers called her ' the most 
noteworthy woman, with perhaps one excep- 
tion, who has appeared in literature since 
Sappho.' And George Eliot, who is the subject 
of the possible exception just mentioned, wrote 
of her as follows : ' I cannot read six pages of 
George Sand without feeling that it is given 
to her to delineate human passion and its re- 
sults, and some of the moral instincts and their 
tendencies, with such truthfulness, such nicety 
of discrimination, such tragic power, and withal 
such loving humor, that one might live a cen- 
tury with nothing but one's own dull faculties, 
and not know so much as those six will sug- 
gest.' And even Mr. Henry James, as far re- 
moved from her as the antipodes in his methods 
and his theories of literary art, accords her ' the 
highest literar}^ instinct — an art of composi- 
tion, a propriety and harmony of diction, such 
as belong only to the masters,' and is con- 
strained to predict that in the coming days of 
the complete triumph of realism, her novels will 
have for our children's children the sort of 
charm that Spenser's ' Fairy Queen ' has for us. 

Here is an impressive array of witnesses, and 
their testimony might be multiplied many times 
over from almost equally significant sources. 
Yet against it we must set the hard fact that 
George Sand's novels are in our time demodes, 
that they are respectfully placed upon the shelf 
and left there to gather dust, that we do not 
recur to tlieir pages for a renewal of the emo- 
tions with which they thrilled our youth, that 
our younger generation has not read them at 
all. The writer herself did not anticipate a 
lasting fame. ' I believe that in fifty years I 
shall be completely forgotten,' she said to Flau- 
bert, ' but my idea has been rather to act upon 
my contemporaries, if only upon some of them, 
and to let them participate in my ideals.' But 
it is not easy to believe that a series of Avritings 
whose influence was so profound upon the world 



of a half-century past can reall)' \>e forgotten, 
or can fail to find in every new generation some 
devoted following. It is true that they belong 
to the literature of the romantic movement, 
which to us now is only a phase of literary his- 
tory; but it is also true that they appeal in 
lovely and eloquent terms to some of the deep- 
est of the abiding instincts of human nature. 

With the English-speaking public at large, 
George Sand has never had a fair chance. Her 
introduction was brought about through the 
medium of her early novels — those passionate 
rhapsodies of revolt which reflected the turmoil 
of an outraged soul groping blindly for light 
and peace. These books, coupled with strange 
and distorted reports of their author's life, out- 
raged the smug self-righteousness of the mid- 
Victorian period, and settled the case of George 
Sand for good. The ripe and chastened work 
of her later years — which means the whole of 
her work save only an insignificant fraction — 
never got an adequate hearing in England, 
although, ^ we have seen, the nobler English 
spirits of the time were among her most appre- 
ciative admirers. In America, the case was 
nearly the same, although we are inclined to 
think that she has been judged with somewhat 
more of charity upon this side of the Atlantic, 
and found a wider acceptance for her gospel of 
democracy, of the dignity of labor, of passion- 
ate belief in the essential goodness of human 
nature, and of the just claims of the individual 
soul. It is a gospel that fits in at many points 
with the idealism which is the basis of our na- 
tional character, and could not fail to find a 
sympathetic hearing. Such a hearing it found 
particularly in the Concord circle, where the 
appearance of ' Consuelo ' was as important an 
event as the discovery of a new oriental relig- 
ion, and where a generous welcome was ex- 
tended to the author and her works. Philistin- 
ism remained blind to this revelation of spirit- 
ual beauty, but the elect did not fail to perceive 
that beneath and behind all these early out- 
pourings of passionate revolt and equally pas-, 
sionate aspiration there was, to use the fine 
phrase of Mr. Myers, ' a certain unity and 
background of peace.' 

Those of us who have all along shared in that 
vision do not expect at this late day to send 
many readers back to a novelist whose work 
reached its climax of force in the forties and 
was completed in the seventies. There are more 
than a hundred volumes of George Sand, and 
most of them are alread}' consigned beyond re-

call to oblivion. But for a few of them — the 
few that give the most typical expression of her 
faith and her many-sided charm — we would 
suggest that they are better worth reading than 
almost any of the current productions upon 
which we waste our attention. They are worth 
reading, not merely because they exemplify a 
period of literary development, but because they 
still have power to stir the soul and strengthen 
the better impulses of our nature. And by way 
of a brief selection, we would suggest ' Valen- 
tine,' for its lyrical passion and its loving de- 
scription of nature ; ' Mauprat,' for its combined 
tenderness and strength ; ' L'Homme de Neige,' 
for the pure and unaffected charm of its narra- 
tive ; ' La Mare au Diable,' for its idyllic em- 
bodiment of rustic life; ' Le Marquis de Ville- 
mer,' for its masterly study of aristocratic so- 
ciety, and ' Consuelo ' with ' La Comtesse de 
Eudolstadt' its sequel, for their richly colored 
delineations of artistic life, their manifold pic- 
turesque incidents, and the lofty spirit that 
breathes in their rather shapeless form. For a 
course in George Sand, we confidently recom- 
mend these seven books, and feel sure that those 
who take it will be grateful to us for the coun- 
sel. 

George Sand herself speaks somewhere of 
^ the literature of mysteries of iniquity, which 
men of talent and imagination try to bring into 
fashion.' Well, they have brought it into fash- 
ion, and most alarmingly, since her death. But 
the thoughts by which she was inspired have 
not lost their vitality, whatever the transforma- 
tions of our literary fashion. And we cannot 
do better in closing than quote once more from 
Matthew Arnold, who sums up his reflections in 
these words : 

' The immense vibration of George Sand's voice 
upon the ear of Europe will not soon die away. 
Her passions and her errors have been abundantly 
talked of. She left them behind her, and men's 
memory of her will leave them behind also. There 
will remain of her to mankind the sense of benefit 
and stimulus from the passage upon earth of that 
large and frank nature, of that large and pure 
utterance — the large utterance of the early gods' 



COMMUNICA TION. 



HERBERT SPENCER ON HOMER'S ' ILIAD.' 

(To the Editor of The Dial.) 
'Passing over its tedious euumeration of details of 
■dresses and arms, of chariots and horses, of blows given 
and received, filling page after page, — saying nothing of 
the boyish practice of repeating descriptive names, such as ■ 
well-greavod Greel<s, long-haired Achseans, horse-breaking 



Trojans, and so forth (epithets which when not relevant 
to the issue are injurious) ; passing over, too, the many 
absurdities, such as giving the genealogy of a horse while 
in the midst of a battle, and not objecting that the subject- 
matter appeals continually to brutal passions and the 
instincts of the savage ; it suflBces to say that to me the 
ceaseless repetition of battles and speeches is intolerable. 
Even did the ideas presented raise pleasureable feelings, 
a lack of sufficiently broad contrasts in matter and manner 
would repel me.' 

Right or wrong, an honest, fresh, unhackneyed 
criticism should always be made an occasion of 
new light upon the merits of a great book; for this 
result is sure to follow when the criticism is 
rightly discussed: the outcome must be either to 
establish more firmly our former admiration, or 
to modify it as it should be modified. But a culti- 
vated critic will not find it easy to appreciate Mr. 
Herbert Spencer's strictures on Homer, because 
to do so demands that one shall, for the time at 
least, assume Mr. Spencer's point of view. That 
Is to say, he must discover how he himself would 
be impressed by the ' Iliad ' if he had not formed 
his literary tastes largely upon Homer; and he 
must consent to limit himself to an estimate of 
the essential value of Homer's poetic ideas — the 
entire content of his story, with its characters, 
passions, and incidents, — as distinct from the 
worth of the poems as archagological records on 
the one side, and as artistry in words on the other. 

One who has been educated in the old classic 
curriculum will find it difl[icult to satisfy himself 
that no inconsiderable part of his admiration for 
Homer, Vergil, and Horace, is due to the simple 
fact that he has been carefully trained to identify 
excellence with the practice of these authors. He 
was made to study them admiringly, line by line 
and word by word; to account for each peculiarity 
of each verse as originating in some rule of art 
or in some principle of philosophy or psychology. 
It may happen that one has found out, in subse- 
quent years, that some of those rules of art were 
unfounded or trivial, and that some of those prin- 
ciples of psychology were delusions; that the appli- 
cation of them was often forced, the result of a 
determination to make out, at all costs, that every 
word of the text is perfect. But, even so, it is not 
easy to cast off the habit of admiration, created by 
that prolonged training, sufficiently to become 
able to answer the question, ' If I had not been 
trained on Homer, if I had formed my literary 
standards on Shakespeare, and had then taken 
up Homer, how fully would he satisfy me? ' For 
centuries most educated English and American 
writers have accepted the Bible as the standard 
for religion, theology, ethics, and within a certain 
field for history; but the classics were the stand- 
ard for taste. Some twenty years ago I heard a 
white-haired ' professor of Biblical Theology ' 
assert that, in comparison with Isaiah and Paul, 
Homer seemed to him to be but 'poppycock'; 
and a little earlier than that, I heard an intelli- 
gent reader of a wide selection of books say, 
' When I have been reading Shakespeare, all other 
poets. Homer included, seem not to be strong 
meat, — just food for babes.' The more I have 
pondered on this question the more difficult I have 
found it to assure myself that this second quota- 



THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



tion does not express the real and essential dif- 
ference between the two poets, as the first one, 
however inelegantly, measures the actual differ- 
ence between Homeric and Biblical divinity. 

Mr. Spencer read Homer only in translation, 
and so lost all that inheres in perfection of style; 
but the points to which he directed attention are 
those as to which an author suffers least, if at all, 
in translation. Dignity and nobility of action, 
rationality of plot, complexity of characterization 
and charm of personality, the tendency to empha- 
size the noble and to slight the trivial, absence of 
childish credulity accompanied by hearty faith in 
the essentially human, discrimination between the 
human and the divine, a natural and unwarped 
order, — in these and like matters a good trans- 
lation represents an original correctly and with 
fair adequacy. The style is dissipated in transla- 
tion, and with it vanish those finer touches of char- 
acterization that are given by the delicacies of 
style. No eulogium, therefore, upon the Homeric 
style can answer or much minimize objections 
brought against the contents of the poems when 
read in the original or in translation. So long as 
the translator has not originated the things 
assailed, the charge lies against the original Greek. 

If it be assumed that it is a matter of small 
consequence how unsatisfactory the contents of a 
poem may be, provided the style is perfect and a 
charming display of beauty is achieved, it might 
be worth while to try to learn what Homer under- 
took to do, what he himself seems to have cared 
for. Did he try to tell a story about the conduct 
and passions of men, or did he set out to charm 
his hearers by artistry in words? I confess that 
I enjoy no such full and clear information about 
Homer as some critics claim to have obtained, — 
Mr. Quiller-Couch, for instance. He tells us that 
Homer is one of those authors ' who begin with 
the love of expression, and intent to be artists in 
words, and come through expression to profound 
thought.' How happy the man who knows all 
this! He must, at the least, have proof (1) that 
all the Homeric writings were the product of one 
mind; (2) that the order in which that mind pro- 
duced his chants is known; (3) that he can tell 
which of them were written as studies in style, 
and which to express thought. But, ignorant as 
I am, I can only consult the immortal verses to 
learn what the poet supposed, or perhaps pre- 
tended, that he was about. He asserts (or should 
I say 'they' assert?) a purpose to let the world 
know about the wrath of Achilles and its destruc- 
tive consequences. Possibly if he had been more 
candid he would have entreated his muse to sup- 
ply some thousands of dactyls and spondees, duly 
variegated with colors of vowel-play, alliteration, 
' PVF,' and all such elements of the music of 
speech. But so long as he set down In plain 
words his professed purpose, I can only accept it 
as the real motive of his work, and must assume 
that his art was only his charming means of car- 
rying his message straight and strongly to the 
bosom of men. If the question were as to Milton 
or Shelley, one could be quite sure (since they 
were not humorists) that they would have felt 
insulted rather than stimulated to laughter by 



the suggestion that they cared more for beauty 
of expression than for the truth expressed. Imag- 
ine Shelley, returned to earth incognito, and 
listening to the expounding of his ' Ode to the 
West Wind,' with its 

' Be thou me, impetuous one ! 
Drive my dead thoughts over the universe. 

Like withered leaves, to quicken a new birth ; 
And by the incantation of this verse. 

Scatter, as from an unextinguished hearth 
Ashes and leaves, my words among mankind I 

Be through my lips to unawakened earth 
The trumpet of a prophecy ! ' 

followed by the comment: ' Of course, inasmuch 
as Shelley was an artist, he could not have cared 
much for his ideas (for which only a Philistine 
reader would search his poetry), but must have 
valued his work mainly for the profusion and 
beauty of his images, for the music of the lines, 
and for the ease with which he mastered the diffi- 
cult terza rima, etc' Surely, his orthodox enemies 
would wish him no worse torment than to. be so 
considered b,y his professed admirers. But as to 
Homer, does anyone, unless it be ' Q.' know 
whether he (or they) would feel outraged, or 
moved to ' inextinguishable laughter,' by such an 
idea as to the aim of his twenty-four books? 

Some years ago the charge was made that the 
subject of the ' Iliad ' was essentially unworthy 
to be made the theme of a great poem, inasmuch 
as it was reducible to a quarrel over the posses- 
sion of a captive woman. ' Christopher North ' 
(if my memory is not at fault, — I read the papers 
about forty years ago) stood forth as the poet's 
champion, and argued that a woman is well worth 
fighting for, and nothing more so. I read his 
defence when just finishing three years of service 
in the army of the Union, and did not quite accept 
the proposition that my own soldiering had been 
for a cause no more noble than ownership of a 
fair slave; I wondered also how the English edu- 
cated classes would rank the motives of Welling- 
ton at Waterloo compared with the reason for 
which Achilles sulked in his tents. But I could 
not but admire the frankness and candor with 
which the champion entered the fray. He did not 
dodge the question by sliding off into laudation 
of style; he did not dismiss the charge with pity 
or scorn of a critic so ignorant as to suppose that 
adequacy and nobility of motive is a topic of liter- 
ary criticism, — he met the issue as it had been 
presented. Mr. Spencer's strictures on Homer 
should be weighed in the same frank manner. 
The call is for the consideration of but three ques- 
tions. Do the Homeric poems contain the things 
which Mr. Spencer claims to have detected in 
them? If they are there, are they blemishes or 
not? If they are blemishes, how serious are they, 
when considered in their totality in relation to 
the entire poems? To discuss these questions is 
to exhibit real regard for the reputation and 
influence of the majestic Greek: to laugh at them, 
to pity a man who can ask them, to substitute for 
them rhapsodies on the Homeric style, is in very 
truth to confess judgment, supposing that the 
defeat can be covered up by shouting.

THE DIAL, 



d>c Hetu IVooIiS. 



A Xe^v Observer in the Philippines.* 

It is something of a paradox to say that one 
finishes Mr. Lander's large book with a feeling 
of knowing more about the Philippines than 
ever before, and, considering the extraordi- 
nary opportunities afforded the traveller, vastly 
less than he had reason to expect. For Mr. 
Landor is always in search, primarily, of 
adventure ; and, having that, is satisfied. After 
seeing almost all the different peoples of the 
islands, he suggestively styles them 'bewilder- 
ing tribes ' ; and in this the reader will doubt- 
less agree with him. Of his attainments in one 
almost essential regard, he himself speaks in 
the paragraph following: 

' In a virgin forest of this kind there is more 
than plenty to interest and puzzle any botanist, 
but an average man, like the writer, gets simply 
bewildered by the incredible variety of trees and 
the dense mass of them; by the unaccountable 
number of orchids and other creeping and para- 
sitic plants which hang or stick out or sprout 
everywhere upon the larger trees; by the astonish- 
ing toughness of the numberless creepers and 
fibres which hang from everywhere, — and all 
this in the moist, suffocating, used-up air of the 
dark forest, where sunlight in all its intensity 
never penetrates, so that it seems incomprehensi- 
ble how the luxuriant undergrowth can not only 
exist but flourish as it does. It was interesting to 
watch the strain of the larger trees to force their 
way up and obtain air. Many of them were devoid 
of branches up to a great height.' 

It will be noted that this describes a forest 
in tropical America quite as accurately as in 
the Philippines, and that the last sentence even 
contains a fact quite as true of the temperate 
zone and its forest trees. This is typical of 
the entire book. There is an equal failure to 
discriminate in regard to matters best worth 
dwelling upon, of which another instance may 
be found in the account of the visit to the Cal- 
amians, told thus: 

' We were confronted by a curious tree which 
had a large horizontal branch on which were thir- 
ty-seven vertical cuts. Now, according to some 
authority, these notches denote the age of the man 
who cut them — but I think this is not so; first, 
because I rather doubt whether the Tagbanouas 
could mark the time more exactly than by the rainy

vals of time.' 

Three more conjectures are then taken up 
and disposed of, leaving the reader wondering

why an observation so profitless should be made 
at all. 

]Mr. Lander's point of view is characteris- 
tically British in its feeling of superiority to 
the rest of the world, and not in the least what 
Americans thinJc of as English in other respects. 
He loves to tell of himself in the most peril- 
ous predicaments, and as remaining absolutely 
cool and collected whatever befalls. There is 
always a self-Taunting that one is forced to feel 
is not waiTanted ; and this is quite as character- 
istic of his latest as of his earliest work. 

Against defects like these must he placed 
advantages resulting from the unusual length 
of the Journey, and the fact that it was taken 
under government auspices and with every aid 
that the local authorities of the United States 
could give. The account is essentially of a 
popular nature, with much vagueness of detail. 
Though half the space in the book is felt to be 
wasted, what remains does give a general 
impression of the archipelago and of the results 
of American occupancy there not found else- 
where; and this gives the work a real value. 

j\Ir. Landor impresses his readers with a 
sense of the experimental character of the 
work the American government is doing in 
the Philippines. There appears to be no desire 
to profit by the experience of other colonial 
administrators, not even those of Great Britain 
in the closely related countries of Borneo and 
the Malayan peninsula, but rather to solve 
every problem afresh from the vantage-ground 
of American democracy; something which Mr. 
Landor cannot comprehend, much less sympa- 
thize with. It appears that the American 
authorities are experimenting with leper col- 
onies, with stock farms, with schools, with 
wages, with food for their soldiers, with tribe 
after tribe of natives, and that success in any 
one thing seems remote. 

This brings one to the second impression left 
by the book in regard to American occupancy : 
that everything is to be done in a rush. Relig- 
ion is left free from experiment in a degree, 
but in every other respect of the life of such 
of the Filipinos as have fallen under the flag 
there is to be immediate and j>ermanent re- 
form. They are to learn the English language 
as spoken by American school-teachers, and 
al>andon their o\vn. They are to take up 
lines of industry in which they are not in the 
least interested, and become brisk, businesslike, 
and untropical, straightway. Nothing seems 
more to annov the American who is accustomed

to getting things done, Mr. Landor records, 
than Philippine inertia. Yet he notes that he 
had no difficulty in obtaining men to do the 
work incidental to his journey, and that he 
saw men who had refused to work under Ameri- 
can direction for five times the ordinary wage 
cheerfully laboring under ecclesiastical stimu- 
lus for little or nothing. 

While governors and others in authority, 
with whom Mr. Landor conversed, admitted 
nearly all that he had to say in favor of Brit- 
ish colonial methods, wherein a few English- 
men direct the work of many thousands of 
natives, as in India, Malaya, and Egypt, there 
was always behind the American admissions a 
sense of having another, a better, and a more 
expeditioi^ way. To borrow a figure from 
geology. Great Britain believes in the evolution- 
ary, American in the catastrophic theory of rul- 
ing men of another color. Significant, too, is 
such a statement as this : 

' One cannot help being struck by the splendid 
way in which the Spaniards did everything, down to 
the most minute details, in public works. There 
was no shabbiness about them. Everything was 
made in a practical way, and made to last, — a 
great contrast to the American way, which builds 
everything flimeily and temporarily. Where 
Americans put up bridges of wood, which tumble 
down with the first rain, and cut down roads with- 
out metalling them, so that they are soon over- 
grown with vegetation and impassible with mud, 
the Spaniards built solid bridges of masonry, Iron 
or of strong, well-tarred wood on cantilever prin- 
ciples.' 

To support this generalization, many specific 
instances are cited; and in curious contrast to 
this criticism goes an unbounded respect for 
the * Americans who are doing something,' and 
a contempt equally unbounded for those who 
find fault at a distance. For the men in real 
authority, Mr. Landor has nothing but praise; 
and he is equally unstinted in his admiration 
for the fighting qualities of the American sol- 
dier, whom he saw in action at the taking of 
the Baoolod fort?. Yet he speaks of the 
unpromising material of which the administra- 
tive subordinates is made in part, and he reads 
a really terrific indictment against the intem- 
perance introduced into the islands by the 
Americans wherever it has been possible. And 
for our manners to the natives (the same 
charge is brought against the English gener- 
ally) he has blame in abundance. 

Finally, he sums up in two sentences the 
general effect of the contact of the Caucasian 
upon the hopeless mixture of races he has de- 
lineated, bv saving, ' The more civilized the 



province, the greater the crime,' and ' Person- 
ally my experience was that the less Christian- 
ized the people the nicer they were.'

The Personality and Teachings of 
T olsto y.* 

However one may regard Tolstoy as an in- 
fluence — whether he be classified as the great- 
est moral leader of the century or as an incon- 
sistent fanatic, whether he stands forth in men- 
tal vision as ' The Grand Mujik ' or as a mere 
poseur, — there is interest among all readers 
in the personality and romantic environment 
of the man. Hence the earnest and the curious 
alike will enjoy the portrayal of him by one 
of his most sympathetic and grateful visitors of 
recent years. Dr. Edward Steiner. Renewing 
an acquaintance of student days in Germany, 
with treasured memories of the magnetic in- 
fluence then exerted, the author has in full ma- 
turity placed himself again under the sway of 
Tolstoy's presence, has examined by direct and 
intuitive processes the elements of his char- 
acter, and has described the prophet-novelist 
and his home region with vividness and force. 
From recollections of Tolstoy in Russia and 
Germany, gathered through intimate contact 
with both the peasantry and the cultured 
classes, Dr. Steiner has interwoven incidents 
and traits into a faithful pictorial background 
for the portrait of his hero. In the main the 
estimate is well-balanced, with just enough of 
personal enthusiasm to give the work a graphic 
force. Though at times lenient to a fault as 
to some minor flaw of temperament, the author 
has not seriously digressed from his avowed pur- 
pose, — ' That I may not dim his glory, and yet 
not unduly exalt him, that I may not misrep- 
resent him and yet truthfully present him to 
view, that I may satisfy the curious and yet 
bring them nearer to the source of the teach- 
ings of Tolstoy, which is the Gospel of Jesus, 
this is my only desire.' 

The author's first visit had been to Yasnaya 
Polyana, with a group of students to whom 
' War and Peace ' had come as a new message 
of life to combat their rationalistic philosophy. 
Forty years later he finds the inspirer of his

young manhood even more gracious in illness 
and old age^ still a rapt listener to music and 
conversation, deeply concerned for the welfare 
of all classes and all nations. The changes that 
have taken place during these forty years in 
Tolstoy's life and that of Eussia, the steps by 
which he has both progressed and retrogressed 
as an artist in fiction, the spiritual struggles 
through which he has passed in evolving his 
unique and paradoxical moral code, are treated 
at length in this study of his personality. 
Tracing many of his peculiarities to his isolated 
childhood and to his manhood of indulgence, 
operating in turn upon a mind of deep specu- 
lative impulses, his life in the army is likened 
to the parable of the Prodigal Son. Here he 
*came to himself,' wakened not alone to his 
moral depravity and the broader questions of 
ethics in war and society, but realized also his 
literary possibilities. In this study of his life, 
critical and expository comments on his fiction 
are supplementary to the main motive — the 
effort to trace the development of the man's 
mind and soul as revealed through his works, 
from the slighter sketches of ' Sebastopol ' and 
' The Cossacks ' to the novels of thrilling prob- 
lems, ' Anna Karenina,' ' Kreutzer Sonata,' 
and ' Resurrection.' With a careful inquiry re- 
garding the effect of each event in shaping char- 
acter, the author outlines the years of travel, 
the years of absorbing domestic life, the experi- 
ments in teaching and husbandry among the 
peasants, and the gradual alienation of many 
disciples and even some members of his fam- 
ily, because of his persistent and seemingly in- 
consistent theories on marriage, education, and 
government. At the zenith of his fame and 
promise as a novelist, and the culmination of 
his home-happiness, Tolstoy was inwardly pass- 
ing through a crisis so severe that it menaced 
his reason and his life. From this struggle he 
emerged with a new gospel, familiar to us 
through the tracts, ' My Confession,' and ' My 
Religion,' as well as in his later fiction. Dr. 
Steiner offers no labored logic to systematize 
or harmonize these later ideas of the moral 
teacher. He states them with clearness, and 
emphasizes the effects of such teachings upon 
his neighbors in spirit throughout the world. 
Returning to the primal purpose of the volume, 
he gives a graphic narrative of the ' two worlds 
in the Tolstoy household,' pays strong deference 
to the graces and efficiency of the Countess, and 
presents in vivid contrasts the classes of visitors 
and parasites. The relations between Tolstoy 



and Turgenieff always awaken literary interest, 
and we are given a recital of their early friend- 
ship, their later misunderstanding and open 
quarrel, and the reconciliation and fulfilment of 
Turgenieff's prophecies for Tolstoy's art. In 
his summary, the author has laid stress upon 
Tolstoy's simplicity and zeal for truth in Ms 
life and writings, while the creed that has 
brought forth so many exhaustive statements by 
theologians and sociologists has been succintly 
phrased, ' God is his father, all men are his 
brethren.' The volume gains materially in in- 
terest from the illustrations, in color, by the 
friend of the Tolstoy family, the Russian artist 
Pasternak. 

In marked contrast with the plan and form 
of the volume just cited is the study of Tol- 
stoy's religious and social tenets, by Mr. Knowl- 
son. The volume devoted to Tolstoy's personal- 
ity was intended primarily for journal narra- 
tive, and portions of it appeared in ' The 
Outlook.' Its style is pictorial and somewhat 
discursive. The peculiar qualities of Mr. 
Knowlson's study, on the other hand, are con- 
ciseness and logical sequence. There is a brief 
but suggestive account of Tolstoy's external life 
as boy and man, and a forceful development of 
his altruism, his love for nature, and his re- 
version from the type of an aristocrat to that 
of a would-be peasant. In his analysis of Tol- 
stoy as a novelist, the author gives him high 
praise for characterization, scenic skill, and 
dramatic motives. In choice of characters and 
setting, he draws an analogy between Tolstoy 
and Thomas Hardy; a comparison met with be- 
fore in current criticism. In style, in natural- 
ness, in emphasis of Hhe primary passions of 
life as forming the best material for represent- 
ing life in its dramatic intensity,' these authors 
present noteworthy resemblances. Witii an 
acknowledgment that Tolstoy's tenets are never 
fully expounded, Mr. Knowlson distinguishes 
between Tolstoy as a moralist rather than a 
philosopher, and examples the mysticism, the 
asceticism, and the noble charity of his creed, 
by ample quotations from such of his treatises 
as ' What I Believe,' ' The Christian Teaching,' 
' Patriotism and Government.' With justifiable 
frankness, the inconsistences of Tolstoy's beliefs 
are shown; but the author has emphasized two 
significant thoughts as a result of his study, — 
first, Tolstoy has a sincere purpose to live lit- 
erally as near like Christ as he can under the 
contradictions of his environment, to " which 
purpose may be traced some of the views most

at variance with accepted Christian doctrines 
of today; second, Tolstoy's inflvience in Russia 
and the outside work! is great though unde-

say, ' This is idealism, but it is not life ' ; but 
with equal candor one must admit, ' Leo Tol- 
stoy is a world-character who in some directions 
will tecome a world-force. . . . This ranch, 
however, may be said for the Iiussian idealist, 
— that of all schemes for universal good his is 
the mightiest in its Universality, in its attempt 
at Uniformity, and in its plea for bringing all 
inharmonious elements into Unity.' This study 
of Tolstoy's writings and doctrines has a val- 
uable bibliograph}" but neither this volume 
nor that by Mr. Steiner has any index, — a 
serious inconvenience in books so general in

A British Tiew of the American' 

KEA'OI.UTIOX.* 



The initial volume of Sir George Otto Tre- 
velyan's History of the American Revolution, 
which has been for some years before the pub- 
lic, is now supplemented by an instalment of 
the work in two volumes, which justifies the 
expectations of the author's friends that he 
would furnish at least a highly acceptable 
accmmt of the events of that era. It is not 
possil)le and proper to say that Trevelyan's is 
destined to be one of the leading histories of 
that revolution. These two volumes cover only 
the years of 17 io and 1776; but no less space 
could well be taken for that period, and the de- 
liberation with which Trevelyan proceeds with 
his- work- is M^arranted by his thoroughness. 
This historian deems the events of that period 
to be of too commanding importance to allow 
any -but the most painstaking research or the 
most considerate recital. As evidently planned 
by him, the diistory when completed will be 
upon a scale commensurate with the colossal 
character of the transformation of thirteen 
feeble British colonies into a Federal Republic 
of marvellous promise and potency. It is his 
purpose to exhibit this evolution from a Brit- 
ish point of view, but unembarrassed l)y British 
prejudice. His sympathy with the American 
side of 'the controversy which provoked the rev- 
olution is. frank -and undisguised; it is more

mans, Green, & Co. 



pronounced than that shown by either Bryce or 
Dicey in their commentaries, broader and 
more persistent than the partial friendliness of 
Goldwin Smith. 

Trevelyan sees both sides of the great con- 
troversy, and writes for readers on both sides 
of the Atlantic; and he relates in detail the 
English contention and views, no less than those 
of America. The merits of the original con- 
troversy, and the strength of the dialectics in 
which it was at first waged, he finds to have 
been distinctly with the Americans. Here ap- 
pears a transatlantic historian, ready to help 
rescue the history of that era from the Philis- 
tines, on both sides of the sea, who would dis- 
tort and misstate it. Trevelyan's pages should 
rejoice the critical heart of Mr. T. E. Watson, 
who in his recent account of the ' Life and 
Times of Jefferson ' deplores the fact that ' a 
tendency has been show'n by some historians to 
justify Great Britain and to blame the col- 
onies,' and who repudiates the charge that 
America ' started a quarrel without just cause, 
and kept it up in spite of all attempts at recon- 
ciliation.' Trevelyan notes the same tendency 
in some American writers. Scrutinizing it, he 
finds it due largely to a revolt against the ful- 
some panegyric sometimes bestowed on the co- 
lonial leaders. But he demurs to the historical 
value of the criticism which condemns such ex- 
treme praise, and says that whatever may be 
the merits of the criticism in other respects, 'as 
an argument for or against the British policy, 
it is of no account at all.' He adds tliat ' the 
question to be determined, at successive points 
of the American controversy, was in every case 
a clear and simple issue'; and he declines to 
be ranked among the apologists for the hard- 
headed British leaders who, 'over and over 
again, at a very great crisis, adopted a wrong 
course, in defiance of the opinion strongly held 
and fearlessly urged by many of the best and 
most far-seeing of their own contemporaries.' 
How fair and unprejudiced appear to be the 
judgments advanced by Trevelyan, in respect 
to the leaders in his own country in that stren- 
uous time, cannot well be illustrated within the 
limits of a review, but will apjiear clearly to 
those who read his pages. 

The office thus assumed by Trevelyan, of tell- 
ing his countrymen the unpleasant truth about 
the harsh manner in which their forefathers 
treated their American cousins, is but a con- 
tinuation or a renewal of the task which his 
kinsman Macaulav had set for himself; for it

was his design, as Trevelyan states, to continue 
his ' History of England ' down to a date 
within the memory of his own contemporaries, 
and to show to them ' how imprudence and ob- 
stinacy broke the ties Avhich bound the ISTortli 
American colonies to the parent state.' 

Three chapters are devoted by the author 
to illustrating the condition and peculiarities 
of i>uhlic sentiment in England at the outbreak 
of the war, the disfavor with which the King's 
l3elligerent plans were received and thwarted 
in many quarters, and his numerous unsuccess- 
ful attempts to enlist the services of eminent and 
influential public men in the active prosecu- 
tion of the war. We are shown in detail the 
whole array of discontent, criticism and popu- 
lar opposition, which made it impossible for 
the King to send native Britons in sufficient 
force to make the attempt to overawe the 
Americans, and forced him to hire foreign mer- 
cenaries. It may well gladden the hearts of 
Americans to recall that their English brethren 
were so generally in sympathy with the ' Brit- 
ons in i\merica ' as to create the royal need for 
foreign legions; so that there was, after all, 
a silver lining to the dark and ugly Hessian 
cloud. 

It seems but natural that the influence of 
Macaulay should appear upon almost every 
page of our author's work; in his literary and 
historical style, in his ideas as to the demands 
of historical narrative upon the narrator, in 
his choice of historical perspective, in his fre- 
quent resort to personal portraiture, in his 
slight regard for the details of campaigns, and 
in his preference for tracing the path of 
progress by exhibiting the influence of motives 
and forces in historical movements, as shown 
in particular episodes. The pains taken by 
Parson Gordon to collect data for his history 
of the revolution, and his appeal to British 
favor by publishing his work, after the war, in 
England, where it fell flat by reason of its lack 
of fidelity to his great subject; the develop- 
ment of the revolution in Pennsylvania senti- 
ment, out of colonial Toryism and into stal- 
wart Americanism; the influence of the pub- 
lication and circulation of Paine's ' Common 
Sense,' in 1776, in working a great change in 
public opinion and fostering the thought that 
the assumption of independence was a timely 
and national duty, — such are some of the epi- 
sodes graphically set forth in these pages. 

If the author's sympathy with the Americans 
in their heavy struggle were not otherwise ap- 
parent, it would be disclosed in the evident 



pleasure with which he recites many an anec- 
dote illustrating the feeling and the spirit 
which animated the leading revolted colonists, 
— such, for instance, as the calm and un- 
ruffled determination displayed by Franklin, 
Adams, and Rutledge, and the quick-witted 
repartee of their replies to Lord Howe in their 
conference with him over his desire to promote 
a reconciliation. In its honhommie, and its re- 
gard for the finer and nobler elements of hu- 
manity, Trevelyan's work reminds one of John 
Fiske's; and while American readers would not 
willingly lay aside Fiske's history of the Ameri- 
can Eevolution, they 'will no doubt be pleased 
to supplement it with Trevelyan's.

New Stltdies of Society axd 
Literature.* 

Probably few other men of his time knew 
the eighteenth century more intimately or stud- 
ied it more sympathetically than the late Sir 
Leslie Stephen. His ' English Thought in the 
Eighteenth Century,' first published in 1876, 
remains the greatest work in its field; his 
biographies of Swift, Pope, and Johnson are 
works of surpassing merit. In ' English Litera- 
ture and Society in the Eighteenth Century,' 
being the Ford Lectures delivered last year at 
Oxford and published since his lamented death, 
Mr. Stephen has left us a highly illuminating 
discussion of certain general aspects of literary 
history which the text-books too rarely touch 
upon. He recognizes the change in the meth- 
ods of criticism, which has largely abandoned 
the administration of a fixed code of laws for 
the historical attitude, and which now asks first 
what pleased men and then why. Adequate 
criticism must therefore be rooted in history ; 
between literature and general social condi- 
tions there exists a close connection. If we 
would understand the weakness of Elizabethan 
literature, as well as its excellences, we must 
study the complexities of Elizabethan society. 

From this point of view, then, he surveys the 
literary output of the century of Addison and 
Johnson and Burke; of Walix)le and Chatham; 
of Deism and the Methodist revival. At the 
opening of the century, the Wits formed ■' a 
kind of island of illumination amid the sur- 
rounding darkness of the agricultural country.' 
Addison was an urbane prophet of culture, who

attempted ' to set forth a view of the world and 
human nature which should be thoroughly re- 
fined and noble, and yet imply a full appre- 
ciation of the humorous aspects of life.' With 
the breaking up of club and coffee-house 
society, the age of the Wits was succeeded by 
that in which Pope dominated, an age which 
called for satire, and which found Chesterfield's 
good-natured cynicism agreeable. 

Meanwhile the plebeians grew into promi- 
nence, and after Walpole's death literature was 
more and more distinctly addressed to the 
middle class. The professional critic appeared. 
Moral and religious reading was demanded. 
Though the aristocratic order was accepted as 
inevitable, there was a growing feeling that the 
rulers were corrupt. It is the time of the 
moralist, and of the birth of the novel or por- 
trait of manners. 

The age of Johnson, which succeeded, is in 
literature an age of stagnation. The industrial 
revolution took place ; in politics the democratic 
movement appeared, led, however, by men who 
'proposed to remove abuses, not to recast the 
whole system.' A society independent of the 
aristocracy had grown up, ' which is already be- 
ginning to be the most important social stratum 
and the chief factor in political and social de- 
velopment.' 

The watchword of every literary school may 
be stated as a ' return to Nature ' ; and the lec- 
ture concludes by showing that the difference 
between the various schools lies in the different 
interpretations of the formula. For Addison, 
Swift, Pope, it meant, be rational, avoid 
pedantry; in the period of Eichardson and 
Fielding, middle-class John Bull demands por- 
traits of real living men and. women, and re- 
pudiates aristocratic rationalism; in the demo- 
cratic period, cant and sham sentimentalism are 
condemned and realism is demanded, even 
though it be served in old bottles. 

Somewhat along this line does our author 
conduct us in a survey of the century which 
above all others exhibits a prevailing temper 
akin to his own — a distrust of enthusiasm, a 
love of common-sense, a perception of historic 
continuity. We lay down the book with re- 
gret; for the hand that wrote it is still, and has 
left no successor. 

The typography of the volume is commend- 
able; we wish, however, that it had been pro- 
vided with a descriptive table of contents, run- 
ning-heads, and an index.

The Birth-D ate o f Columbus.* 

Mr. Vignaud's monograph on the date of 
Columbus's birth is an interesting discussion of 
a much controverted subject. Columbus him- 
self never stated his age, but made various 
statements respecting the length of different 
periods of his life. As these statements are 
contradictory, and all are of equal authority, 
Mr. Vignaud rejects the computations based 
upon any of them. The only statement of Co- 
lumbus's age made by any of his contemporaries 
is that of Bernaldez, that he died in 1506 ' at 
a fine old age, being about seventy.' This state- 
ment was the basis of the conclusions of early 
biographers that he was born in 1436. Its 
form indicates that it was an estimate rather 
than a statement of positive knowledge. Since 
it has become apparent, from facts discovered 
in regard to his family, that Columbus could 
scarcely have been born as early as 1436, it 
has been suggested that the transcriber wrote 
setenta, seventy, instead of sesenta, sixty, a 
change of only one letter. If Columbus was 
sixty at the time of his death, he was bom 
about 1446 ; and this date has been the favorite 
one with recent biographers. This assumed 
error in transcription is open to the objection 
that if Bernaldez had meant sixty he would 
hardly have called it 'a. fine old age.' 

The latest estimates of the date of Colum- 
bus's birth are based upon certain notarial doc- 
uments executed by him and by members of 
his family. The most important of these is an 
acknowledgment of debt, executed in 1470, with 
the consent of his father, which describes him 
as ' a major of nineteen years.' Mr. ■ Harrisse 
takes this to mean that Columbus was at that 
time between nineteen and the full age of 
twenty-five, and hence was bom between 1445 
and 1451. Mr. Vignaud, following a sugges- 
tion made by Mr, Richard Davey in 1892 and 
since accepted by Senor de La Rosa, thinks 
that ' a major of nineteen ' means a major nine- 
teen years of age; and that Columbus, being 
nineteen in 1470, was born in 1451. In Genoan 
law there were majors of sixteen, seventeen, 
and eighteen, under the full age of twenty- 
five, but no major of nineteen; hence the ex- 
pression ' major of nineteen ' could mean noth- 
ing but a major of that age. The objection to 
this construction rests upon a ratification, in 
1473, by Columbus, his mother, and a younger

brother, of a sale made or to be made by the 
father. The parental consent, incorporated in 
the original draft of the deed, was afterward 
struck out by the notary. From this ratifica- 
tion it has been inferred that the brothers were 
of full age in 1473, and that the elder must 
have been born as early as 1446. Mr. Vignaud 
argues that the formal consent of parents to an 
act approving an a«t of their own would have 
been superfluous, and that its inclusion and 
subsequent omission indicate nothing as to the 
age of the sons, since the requirement of 
parental consent was independent of age and 
might be necessary even to majors of twenty- 
five. He does not, however, raise the questions 
why the sons ratified at all, whether they could 
be brought in as interested parties during their 
minority, and whether consent given them 
would be subsequently binding. Two years 
earlier, the mother ratified a similar sale with- 
out the assistance of the sons. Why did they 
join in one act, and not in the other, unless 
their legal status had changed in the mean 
time? It would seem, therefore, that more 
light is needed, either upon the condition of 
the parties or upon the requirements of the 
law, before the question can be regarded as 
finally settled. 

Mr. Vignaud does not discuss the relation of 
the birth-date of Columbus to his life, but 
clearly implies that Columbus intentionally 
misled his contemporaries as to his age in order 
to allow time for the voyages and studies he 
claimed to have made. It is understood that 
this monograph, and the earlier one on Tosca- 
nelli, are studies preliminary to a larger work 
which is to cover the whole career of Colum- 
bus. While the book is primarily intended for 
special students, it is nevertheless of very gen- 
eral interest in affording a glimpse of the 
problems that confront the historian and of the 
methods employed to meet them. .

The 19th Century In ' The History of the Nine- 
as depicted tcenth Century in Caricature ' 

in caricature. (p^^^^ ^j^^^ ^ Company) 

Mr. Arthur Bartlett Maurice and Mr. Frederic 
Taber Cooper have traced the course of the art 
in question from the beginning of political cari- 
cature through the Napoleonic era, during the 
days of Waterloo and the Crimean War, the 
Civil and the Franco-Prussian Wars, to the end 
of the century. Although Hogarth antedates by 



half a century the period covered by the present 
work, it has been deemed essential to recapitu- 
late the achievements of the great domestic 
painter, — although his powers in the line of 
caricature, properly so called, while great, were 
subordinate to his higher merits as a painter of 
'genre,' as the French term it, a delineator of 
popular incidents into which the humorous only 
entered as an ingredient. Of Gillray, the Eu- 
bens of caricature during the Napoleonic wars, 
it is said : ' There is rancor, there is venom, there 
is the inevitable inheritance of the warfare of 
centuries, in tliese caricatures of Gillray, but 
above all there is fear — fear of Napoleon, of 
his genius, of his star.' French art during the 
same period, refined and softened into effem- 
inacy under the class civilization of the ancient 
regime, and rendered prudish also by its ad- 
herence to classical models, had its decorum 
soon shocked by too coarse intermixture of the 
grotesque. The vaunted superiority of French 
taste could not accommodate itself to ' ignoble ' 
exaggeration. The first half of the nineteenth 
century is looked upon as a period of individ- 
ualism — the one-man power in caricature. In 
America the political cartoon, which practically 
began with William Charles's parodies upon 
Gillray, developed in a fitful and spasmodic 
fashion until about the middle of the century. 
The establishment of ' Puck ' and ' Judge ' led 
to a distinct advance in political caricature; it 
also made it possible to draw an intelligent 
comparison between the tendencies of caricature 
in England and America. It was not until 
Thomas Nast began his pictorial campaign 
against the ring which held New York in its 
clutch, that American caricature could claim a 
pencil which entitled it to particular considera- 
tion from the artistic point of view. While the 
impulse to satirize public men in pictures is 
probably as old as satiric verse, the political 
cartoon, as an effective agent in moulding pub- 
lic opinion, is essentially a product of modem 
conditions and methods. The history of a hun- 
dred years of caricature, extending over all 
countries, is a subject which, if attempted at all 
in a single volume, could only be done in the 
form of a compact and well-reasoned essay. The 
entertaining and fragmentary sketches of the 
present historians are desultory but agreeable 
attempts to mirror the ' immeasurable laughter * 
of nations; and they are to be commended for 
the historical accuracy of the text and for the 
skill shown in the selection of illustrations. 



Bright sides of

Just as the sailor is said to

dence in the United States a vivid conception of 
the magnificence of tlie American bath-tub, 
which he has set forth in much detail in liis 
'Dollars and Democracy' (Appieton). No 
Aphrodite ever rose from the wave to more suc- 
cessful contemplation from the eyes of lovers of 
beauty than ' my beautiful snow-white tub, 
with its silver fittings and perennial supply of 
hot water and cold.' This, with the telephone, 
and the electric light 'that gives light,' are 
the. three things that life in England itself fails 
to reconcile our author to, once he has known 
them on the Atlantic's hither shore. But it 
must not be supposed that these are all, but 
rather the prima inter pares. Truly, an aver- 
age struck between this book and that of Mrs. 
Trollope would not give an incorrect view of 
America ; we never were as bad as the English 
gentlewoman made us out, and it is to be feared 
we never can be as good as the English baronet 
says we are. From the astonishment with which 
Sir Philip perceived that the poorer classes of 
Americans are clean in their appearance, it may 
be judged that the British of the same social 
rank are not, — in spite of the criticism passed 
some years ago upon the personal habits of the 
South African burgher. But no blame is to be 
attached to the traveller. He was given every 
opportunity to see the best side of American 
life, and he certainly did not stay here long 
enough to catch the American characteristics, 
as his numerous sketchies, used as illustrations, 
attest; one and all, they are merely pictures of 
English folk in an exotic environment. Such 
adverse criticisms as the book holds are of un- 
important matters from our own point of view : 
things like crowded street-cars, the soot of Chi- 
cago, and yellow journalism. Of the realities 
of American life, excepting the rapidly growing 
luxury among the rich, there is no record, nor 
does there pretend to be. Sir Philip evidently 
had a charming visit to our country, and those 
who read his book will be glad of it.

tention to carry out m his 

book the promise of its title — ' Russia : Her 
Strength and Her Weakness' (Putnam — it 
is still to be said that he finds no 
indications of strength anywhere in the 
empire of the Czar, but everywhere signs of 
such weakness as, persisted in, must inevitably 
drag it and its rulers down to destruction. ISTor 
can the impression be easily avoided that the 
ancient prejudice of the German against the 
Slav is speaking, and speaking loudly, from 
beginning to end of the work — allowing at the 
same time no doubt of the author's intention to 
be fair. In one respect, at least, the statements 
of the book are not verified; the financiers of 



the world, as shown by the rate at which the 
recent war-loan of Russia was negotiated, do 
not believe that the government is near the end 
of its resources, as Mr. von Schierbrand avers, 
and have shown it in the most convincing and 
practical manner. The whole question here 
turns upon the official statistics put forth from 
time to time by the St. Petersburg ministry. 
These, the author states, are confusing, irreg- 
ular, incomplete, belated, and, as he believes, 
deliberately misleading. Yet upon them, of 
necessity, his entire argument is leased ; and this 
may be summarized as the depletion and almost 
wicked exhaustion of the empire at home for 
the sake of gratifying imperial ambitions in 
farther Asia. He proves, by a skilful use of the 
dilatory census reports, that the peasant of old 
Russia is growing poorer and poorer through 
the exactions of tax-gatherers, unwise commu- 
nal laws, and witliholding of education of every 
kind, until to-day he stands with his lands in 
too small sections to be worked to advantage, his 
soil decreasing in fertility, his domestic animals 
few and growing fewer, and himself always on 
the edge of famine. Money taken from him, as 
from the dwellers in the cities of European 
Russia, is spent extravagantly and corruptly in 
the new ^wssessions of Asia ; and this cause, 
coupled with the collapse of M. de Witte's plans 
for the creation of great manufacturing inter- 
ests, leaves the imperial structure undermined 
in its foundations. It is to be inferred from 
this work that the success of the Japanese is 
inevitable, and the author says with deliberation 
that nothing better could ■ possibly befall tlie 
Russian people if they are to go on to real suc- 
cess as a nation. 



History and 
conditions of 
human contact. 



Following closely upon the 
publication of Professor Shal- 
er's essay on ' The Citizen ' 
and his successful dramatic romance ' Elizabeth 
of England' comes 'The Neighbor' (Hough- 
ton, Mitfiin & Co.), a third book from the same 
pen, characterized as the natural history of 
human contact. In it, Professor Shaler 
endeavors to set forth the conditions that orig- 
inally gave rise to individual and racial sym- 
pathies and their opposites, and then to explain 
the manner in which these conditions of human 
contact may be influenced by the organic educa- 
tion of mankind. With all due appreciation of 
the spirit in which Professor Shaler wrote, and 
with due respect for the inherent value of his 
work, it must be set down as unscientific, both 
in its material and in the manner of its presen- 
tation. If the book is meant to be an abstract 
of a vast philosophic question, too much space 
is given to the s]iecific instances of the Jews and 
the Negroes without such a correlation as shall 
bind the parts into a single whole. If the

author's idea was to furnish a backgrouud for 
the treatment of two interesting racial problems, 
his setting forth of each is merely skimming the 
surface af the matters involved. There is noth- 
ing that Professor Shaler has said concerning 
the American African that has not been said 
better by the two race-leaders in their books on 
the subject, and nothing in his study of the 
Je'wnsh question to compare with M. Leroy- 
Beaulieu's masterly work, ' Israel Among the 
Nations.' The tremendous paradoxes that puz- 
zle every student of this latter question, Pro- 
fessor Shaler cpiite ignores. The obtrusive Jew 
he knows, and treats him in many resjjects with 
more kindness than he deserves; this is the Jew 
who doubles your greeting, who ' climbs all over 
you ' in his endeavor to make his way in the 
world, whose mental activity appals the slower 
Aryan mind, and who in all these resj^ects (this 
fact Professor Shaler evidently does not recog- 
nize) stamps himself, not by his Judaism, but 
by the tyj^ical vices of the parvenu. But what 
•of the exclusive Jew, the silent, religious, rigid 
man whom the Christian world does not know 
unless it seeks him, as M. Beaulieu did; the 
Jew who bars his doors against us when we but 
close ours to him, who considers his race and 
his blood too pure for admixture with ours, who 
seeks no converts because he is too clannish and 
too vain of his clan to welcome an outsider, 
who is a Russian in Russia, a Spaniard in 
Spain, an American in America, and yet, 
through the power of some unaccountable vital 
principle, a Jew in every land. This man the 
author of ' The Xeighlwr ' evidently docs not 
know. From his professor's chair he has studied 
the races that stand forth most prominently in 
the American world about him ; from his own 
large sympathies he judges; but it requires 
more than human sympathy to account for 
human sympathies, and Professor Shaler leaves 
the conditions of human contact still unex- 
plained. 



Dreams of the 
betterment of 
humanity. 



So far as Mr. H. G. Wells has 
a method "in his ' Mankind in 
the Making' (Scribner), it 
seems to consist in asking questions at consider- 
able length, and admitting them to be unan- 
swerable at even greater length. The theme is 
the betterment and regeneration, physical, in- 
tellectual, and spiritual, of humanity, — which 
it will be granted, is almost as inclusive a topic 
as humanity is likely to find for discussion 
within the limits of its history. In spite of the 
practical admission that existing problems are 
insoluble through anything less fundamental 
than the march of evolution, the book is cheer- 
ful almost to the point of hilarity. Beginning 
with the possibility of securing artificial selec- 
tion through the mating of men and women on 



Scottish traits 
depicted ty 
a Scotchman. 



other grounds than those they find to-day, Mr. 
Wells confesses that improvement in this re- 
spect is fairly inconceivable, and that any inter- 
ference would in all likelihood result in failure. 
The remaining part of the book is given over 
to problems of education and government. 
Neither a collectivist nor an individualist, the 
author endeavors to steer a middle course be- 
tween these extremes. Somewhat naturally, the 
course of the argument is like that between 
Scylla and Charybdis, and neither socialist nor 
anarchist will admit that the author escapes 
shipwreck. But the book will appeal to many 
and varied interests. It is brightly and sharply 
critical of the world as it is, and none too con- 
fident about what it will Ix^come. It has a 
point of view which, if not stable, is all the 
more capable of seeing life as it is, and as it 
might be, at many angles. It is always stimu- 
lating to thought, even when least to be agreed 
with; and it abounds in suggestions that may 
lead to valuable experiments. It is a sort O'f 
sequel to the author's ' Anticipations ' of two 
years ago, and is like it in many respects; and 
this means that it is much more readable than 
many sounder books will ever be. 

Not so 'unspeakable' as Mr. 
Crosland's Scot are the Scotch 
characters depicted in Sir 
Archibald Geikie's ' Scottish Reminiscences ' 
(Macmillan). Though the book resembles in 
character such collections as Ramsey's ' Remi- 
niscences ' and Cockburn's ' Memorials,' the 
eminent geologist has apparently been very suc- 
cessful in excluding ancient anecdotes. In a 
happy descriptive and anecdotal style, he sets 
down what he himself has seen and heard in his 
professional travels over all parts of Scotland 
and the neighboring islands. Without induc- 
ing paroxysms of mirth, some of his stories are 
uncommonly good — as that of the wealthy iron- 
master who, wishing to furnish his mansion 
with a library befitting his station, and being 
asked by the dealer who was to provide the 
' leebrary ' whether he would have his books 
bound in Russia or Morocco, replied in amaze- 
ment, ' Can ye no get them bund in Glasco' ? ' 
New to most readers will be the reference to a 
custom prevailing, or that once prevailed, 
among the poorest crofters. The author speaks 
of their being obliged to bleed their cattle and 
mix the blood with their meagre supply of oat- 
meal in order to sustain life through unusually 
hard winters. This reminds one of the still 
crueller practice of like nature not uncommon 
among savage tribes. That the Scotch are gifted 
with humor, despite Charles Lamb's opinion to 
the contrary, is proved by its unexpected dis- 
play even amid scenes of woe. But perhaps the 
followincr is rather an instance of a defective 



16

than of a redundant sense of the incongruous: 
' An old couple were exceedingly annoyed that 
they had not been invited to the funeral of one 
of their friends. At last the good wife consoled 
her husband thus : " Aweel, never you mind, 
Tammas, maybe we'll be haein' a corp o' our 
ain before lang, and we'll no ask them.'" 



Anecdotes of 
Whittier and 
his region. 



Mr. Samuel T. Pickard, Whit- 
tier's biographer and intimate 
friend, has given in ' Whittier- 
Land ' (Houghton, Mifflin & Co.) a view of the 
poet too little familiar to most of his readers. 
After an anecdotal sketch of the Merrimac- 
Eiver region associated with the Quaker bard, 
Mr. Pickard adds a chapter on ' Whittier's 
Sense of Humor,' illustrated by quotations in 
both prose and verse. The poet's chuckle, we 
are told, was visible rather than audible. He 
would double up with laughter, and yet utter 
no sound. This mirthful temperament, so little 
suspected by most of us, had its beneficial effect 
in prolonging the life of the far from robust 
poet. So at least thinks Mr. Pickard, who well 
says : ' An earnest man without a sense of 
humor is a machine without a lubricant, worn 
out before its work is done.' Here is a story 
illustrating Whittier's quiet drollery, and short 
enough to quote in the author's words : ' An 
aged Quaker friend from England, himself a 
bachelor, was once visiting Mr. Whittier, and 
was shown to his room by the poet, when the 
hour for retiring came. Soon after, he was 
heard calling to his host in an excited tone, 
" Thee has made a mistake, friend Whittier ; 
there are female garments in my room ! " Whit- 
tier replied soothingly, " Thee had better go to 
bed, Josiah; the female garments won't hurt 
thee." ' A score or more of Whittier's uncol- 
lected poems are contained in the book, which 
is also fully and attractively illustrated from 
photographs. It is an admirable guide and com- 
panion to the tourist in Whittier-Land. 

The legends and ^^^ Charles G. Harper's vol- 
landmarks of the u m c o n ' The Ingoldsby 
ingoidsby Country. Country' (Macmillan) will 
appeal to several classes of readers. Its avowed 
purpose is to trace the landmarks of ' The In- 
goldsby Legends,' a book which, with its 
author, is probably unknown to the majority 
of readers of this generation. While nine 
out of ten people may not know who Ingoldsby 
was, yet, like Izaak Walton, he is likely always 
to have a little circle of devoted friends who 
will not suffer his name to fall into oblivion. 
The Eeverend Richard Harris Barham, known 
to his readers as Thomas Ingoldsby, seems to 
have been a very likable person. The same 
simplicity and kindliness and humor that en- 
deared him to his acquaintances have won for 



him, for more than half a century, the affection 
of those who knew him only through the 
legends. Belonging as they do to no particular- 
period, they will never be out of date; and, 
far from growing smaller, their audience is per- 
haps larger now than on their first appearance. 
Mr. Harper's book will be welcomed by the- 
readers of these famous legends, but it has also 
an interest apart from this. The county of 
Kent has traces of the Roman, Briton, Dane, 
Saxon, and Norman; it is a region abounding 
in historic and antiquarian remains, and Mr. 
Harper has done a valuable work in collect- 
ing the traditions of this richly storied local- 
ity. The tourist, on the watch for out-of-the- 
way and as yet unspoiled spots, will delight in 
the revelation made here of some retired and 
quaint little nooks apart from the ordinary 
course of travel. It is rather a pity that they 
should be thus betrayed to the world, for they 
will not be likely to remain long unmolested. 
The numerous illustrations made by the author 
add greatly to the charm of the present work. 
In these days of the photograph, it is a pleas- 
ure to encounter the old-fashioned woodcuts 
again. 



Charles Reade 
as playwright. 



Mr. John Coleman, the well- 
known theatre-manager, pro- 
lific writer on matters theat- 
rical, and voluminous author of novels of a cer- 
tain grade, presents ' Charles Reade as I Knew 
Him' (Button) in a volume of rather formid- 
able bulk, but rendered attractive by numerous 
illustrations. Reade is here portrayed chiefly 
in his character of playwright. That his first 
and abiding love was play- writing, will surprise 
most readers of his novels. Twenty-five acted 
and ten unacted plays stand to his credit, his 
dramas thus exceeding in number his works of 
narrative fiction. It is significant that, by his^ 
desire, the inscription on his tomb described 
him. as ' dramatist, novelist, journalist.' As Mr. 
Coleman's prefatory note gives warning of the 
character of his book, one must not censure too 
severely its rambling incoherence and careless- 
ness of literary form. But he need not have 
made his hero so extremely colloquial in his 
conversation. 'Fella,' 'fellas,' ' fellaship,' 
'leetle,' 'Maudlen' (the college), — by these- 
eccentricities of spelling in reporting the utter- 
ances of our excellent Charles Reade (Oxford 
graduate, successively fellow, dean, and vice- 
president of Magdalen, and scholarly and ac- 
complished author of 'The Cloister and tlie 
Hearth ') Mr. Coleman gives us something of 
a shock. The book, after all, is better suited to 
those interested in the gossip of the stage than 
to admirers of Reade the novelist, of whom,, 
unfortunately, no satisfactory biography ha* 
yet appeared.

The spirit of 
■Greek Sculpture. 



If one should wish to turn for 
a time from things modem 
and be steeped in the spirit of 
■Greece, he might well read Mr. Edmund von 
Mach's book on ' Greek Sculpture, its Spirit and 
Principles ' ( Ginn & Co. ) . Scholarly, sincere, 
and full of suggestion, it makes an appealing 
plea to its readers for the cultivation of the 
love of Greek art. The work is no mere guide- 
book, mechanically cataloguing the various prod- 
ucts of the Greeks' artistic activity, but is, 
rather, an appreciation of their point of view 
and a suggestion as to its bearing on Art and 
Life. Incidentally, the reader, assisted by plates 
and clear descriptions, gains a considerable 
knowledge of the sculptures themselves; and if 
he he familiar with the work of other authors 
on the subject, he will note that Mr. von Mach 
has by no means bound himself to conventional 
interpretations. Were it not for the careful 
logic with which the author has followed up his 
assertions, one might doubt, at times, the valid- 
ity of his position. But the strength, the force, 
the unity which are shown in the work make 
one feel that what Mr. von Mach states as fact 
is authoritative, and his conclusions are well 
worth consideration. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



' The Langham Series of Art Monographs,' 
edited by Mr. Selwyn Brinton and imported by the 
Messrs. Scribner, is introduced to our notice with 
a volume on Auguste Rodin, by Mr. Rudolf 
Dircks, and one on ' The Illustrators of Mont- 
martre,' by Mr. Frank L. Emanuel. The books are 
well illustrated and prettily bound in limp red 
leather, and on the whole should have no diflBculty 
in holding their own in competition with the 
numerous other series of the same sort now appear- 
ing. 

A ' New Century History of the United States ' 
for the use of schools was the last literary work 
undertaken by the late Edward Eggleston. He 
had nearly completed the work at the time of his 
death, and what it still needed in the way of sup- 
plement and revision has since been done by his 
brother, Mr. George Gary Eggleston, the work being 
now published by the American Book Co. The 
narrative is of excellent literary quality, the illus- 
trations are many and interesting, and the teach- 
ing apparatus is skilfully planned. 

The plays of Vanbrugh, edited by Mr. A. E. H. 
Swain, form the latest reissue in the ' Mermaid 
Series,' imported by the Messrs. Scribner. The 
same importers also send us Defoe's ' Journal of 
the Plague Year,' in the ' Caxton Pocket Classics,' 
and five new volumes of the ' Caxton Thin Paper 
Classics ' — ' The Ingoldsby Legends,' ' Poems by 
Wordsworth,' ' The Shorter Works of Walter Sav- 
age Landor,' and ' The Poems of Elizabeth Barrett 
Browning ' in two volumes. 



Notes. 



' A Contribution to the Theory of Glacial 
Motion,' by Professor T. C. Chamberlain, is a new 
issue in the decennial publications of the Univer- 
sity of Chicago. 

Every few years, Mr. Henry Abbey revises his 
Poems, adding some and omitting others. The 
present edition is the fourth, contains nine new 
pieces, and is published by Messrs. D. Appleton & 
Co. 

' The Book of the Carnation,' by Mr. R. P. 
Brotherston, is the latest addition to Mr. John 
Lane's ' Handbooks of Practical Gardening.' A spe- 
cial chapter on raising new carnations is contrib- 
uted by Mr. Martin R. Smith. 

Mr. Hector Macpherson has condensed into a 
volume of moderate dimensions the greatest of all 
economic classics — Adam Smith's ' Wealth of 
Nations.' The historical matter is generally omit- 
ted, while the theoretical passages are as generally 
preserved. Messrs, Thomas Y. Crowell & Co. are 
the publishers. 

The interest in Dr. Robert F. Harper's presenta- 
tion of ' The Code of Hammurabi ' has made neces- 
sary a second edition of the work, and this will be 
published shortly by the University of Chicago 
Press. A supplementary volume, entitled ' The 
Hammurabi and the Mosaic Codes,' is announced 
as in preparation. 

' A Greek Grammar, Accidence and Syntax, for 
Schools and Colleges,' by Mr. John Thompson, is 
published by Messrs. E. P. Button & Co. The 
object of the work is ' to introduce into schools 
some knowledge of modern comparative philology 
as applied to Greek.' It is a bulky volume of nearly 
five hundred pages. 

An accurate text of Baron de Tocqueville's 
' L'Ancien Regime ' is about to be issued by the 
Oxford University Press. The editor is Mr. G. W. 
Headlam, who has written a short introduction 
explaining de Tocqueville's position among scien- 
tific historians, together with a few notes of a more 
or less elementary kind. 

' The Book of School and College Sports,' pre- 
pared with various editorial assistance by Mr. 
Ralph Henry Barbour, is a book that will certainly 
find a large constituency among youthful athletes. 
The subjects are football, baseball, track and field 
athletics, lacrosse, ice hockey, and lawn tennis. 
The Messrs. Appleton are the publishers. 

Mr. Rudyard Kipling has just finished a new 
volume of short stories, which will be published 
this fall by Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co., under 
the title, ' Traffics and Discoverifes.' This is the 
first volume of Mr. Kipling's collected tales since 
' The Day's Work.' It contains one long tale, ' The 
Army of a Dream,' hitherto unpublished. 

Carlyle's ' Cromwell,' in three volumes, appears 
from the press of the Messrs. Putnam. This is a 
handsome library edition, to which the editor, Mr. 
S. C. Lomas, has brought the equipment of the 
most exacting scholarship for the furnishing of the 
elaborate apparatus of notes. The work is also 
provided with a lengthy introduction by Mr. C. H. 
Firth.

Mr. Edward Berdoe, author of a ' Browning 
Cyclopaedia,' now publishes through Messrs. E. P. 
Button & Co. a useful little ' Primer of Browning,' 
indicating concisely the subjects and outlines of the 
various poems. An appendix contains the poew.

Hawthorne's ' Wayside ' home in Concord. 

Lovers of elegiac poetry have to thank Miss 
Mary Lloyd for a most careful selection of ' Ele- 
gies, Ancient and Modern' (Albert Brandt, Tren- 
ton, N. J.), prefaced with a scholarly 'history of 
elegiac poetry from the earliest days down to the 
present time.' The opening selection, twenty-four 
lines from the ' Rig Veda,' indicates to what 
remote antiquity Miss Lloyd has pushed her stud- 
ies. The closing piece in the first volume (a sec- 
ond is to appear later) brings us down to Con- 
greve. A little discordant in appearance, but in 
that only, is Mr. Lang's prose rendering of ' The 
Lament of Bion,' all the other translations being 
in verse. That the elegies are not all tearful is 
proved by the inclusion of Milton's lines on Hobson 
(of ' Hobson's choice '). 



The ' Addresses and Presidential Messages of 
Theodore Roosevelt, 1902-1904,' with an introduc- 
tion by Senator Lodge, is a recent publication of 
Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons. The volume purports 
to be only a selection, yet the addresses alone num- 
ber thirty-nine — perhaps we may venture to call 
them the thirty-nine articles of the Republican 
faith as held in this year of grace by the official 
head of the party. They deal with pretty nearly 
all subjects, and were originally delivered pretty 
nearly everywhere, from Bangor to Palo Alto, and 
from Charleston to Spokane. Mr. Roosevelt's 
swing around the circle makes Andrew Johnson's 
seem but a small affair. And this is not all, for the 
volume also contains twenty pages of letters, auvl 
nearly two hundred more of presidential messages. 
Mr. Lodge finds ' genuine sincerity ' to be the note 
of these deliverances. We open the book at ran- 
dom, and the first words that strike our eye are 
these: ' I do not intend to appoint any unfit man 
to office.' But even as severe a moralist as Mr. 
Lodge would find it difficult to vouch for the ' fit- 
ness ' (in any other than a Pickwickian sense) of 
some appointments that will occur to the mind of 
every reader.

[July 1, 1904. 




THE growing interest in marriage and divorce legislation throughout the country, 
and the determined efforts put forth in the various denominations to make the 
marriage relation permanent, when once it is entered into, have provoked a great deal 
of discussion of the family and its place in our modern social organization. The 
importance of the home as an institution cannot be appreciated without understanding 
its historical development and its dependence upon sound matrimonial practice. Professor 
George E. Howard, in a three-volume work entitled 

a ^imv^ of ^Patrimonial institutions 

has given us a complete survey of the subject from earliest times down to the most 
recent legislation. The work is divided into three parts and each contains an exhaustive 
treatment of its appropriate topic. The general chapter headings follow :

monial Institutions 

The Patriarchal Theory. 

Theory of the Horde and Mother-Right.

SUMMER READING, so-called, must be absorbing enough to take 

THE reader along WITHOUT THE LEAST CONSCIOUS EFFORT, AND NOTHING 
ACHIEVES THIS RESULT BETTER THAN BOOKS OF DRAMATIC EXCITEMENT OR OF 
DELIGHTFUL HUMOR. HERE ARE SOME PERFECT EXAMPLES OF BOTH CLASSES. 



WHEN WILDERNESS WAS KING 

So successfully has Mr. Parrish woven a beautiful lov6 story around the dramatic struggle for 
Fort Dearborn that his book is now listed among "the six best sellers." There is no doubt 
about its ability to keep the reader's interest — to the exclusion of all his surroundings. Besides, 
its ornamental features and illustrations make it attractive to have around. 



McCUTCHEONS "CARTOONS" 

The volume published last year, " Cartoons by McCutcheon," is of the variety known as *' hardy 
perennial " because its humor is the sort that is just as delightful one year as another, and will 
repay any number of re-readings. This year's volume — "Bird Center Cartoons " — seems in a 
fair way to become a classic. Not to be familiar with the Bird Center characters is now con- 
sidered almost as reprehensible as not knowing one's Dickens. 

THE WARD OF KING CANUTE 

and 

THE THRALL OF LEIF THE LUCKY 

Anyone who has not read these two wonderful Viking romances by Miss Liljencrantz has a most . 
delightful pleasure to anticipate. They. are so fresh. and vigorous, so full of the fjre and splrrt_a£l-^ 
the Norsemen, that they stand in a class by themselves in modern fiction." They can be unhes- 
itatingly recommended to those who appreciate the elusive flavor of true romance, nor must their 
beautiful illustrations be overlooked.

FE TKABC H. 

In the summer of 1304, the e.xiled Ghibel- 
lines, including in their number the greatest 
of Italian poets, made their headquarters in 
the Tuscan town of Arezzo, whence they vainly 
sought to effect a return to their l)eloved Flor- 
ence, which had cast them forth Adth con- 
tumely. One of these exiles, exijelled from 
Florence 'on the same day with Dante some- 
thing more than two years earlier, was a scholar 
and politician of some consequence named Pe- 
tracco ; and to him there was born, on the 30th 
of July, the child destined to a fame among 
Italian poets second only to that of his father's 
friend and fellow-exile. The i^ersonal relations 
which thus link the names of Dante and Pe- 
trarch did not, however, operate to shape the 
two poets in anything like the same mould; and 
the chief instruction offered by setting them 
side by side is found in the marked contrast 
between their temperament, their outlook, and 
their ideals. The main point of contrast is, of 
course, to be found in the fact that Dante was 
the incarnation of the medijeval spirit, while 
Petrarch had in some dim sense the vision of 
the world to come ' and all the wonder that 
should be ' ; the thoughts and the emotions of 
Dante were held in the sttait- jacket of scho- 
lasticism, while those of Petrarch were work- 
ing themselves free from that hampering con- 
finement ; while Dante's ideal of the future took 
the Utopian form of the universal dual monar- 
chy of Papacy and Empire, the words of Pe- 
trarch, declaring that 

' 'L'antico valore 

Neir italici cor non e 'aneor morto,' 

made his voice the first of those to be raised in 
prophecy of the very practical ideal of a united 
Italy. In a word, the teniijer of Dante, for 
all ills deep tenderness and spiritual exaltation, 
was that of the schoolman; that of Petrarch, 
on the other hand, for all the mistaken direc- 
tion of his aims, was that of the humanist. 

It has recently been suggested, in a semi- 
humorous way, that American contributions 
toward the erection of a monument iat Arezzo 
might most appropriately Ix; made by such of 
our fellow-countrymen as had ventured to prac- 
tice the art of sonnet-writing. Certainly, if 
all of those thus designated should respond to 
the appeal, al)imdant means would be forthcom- 
ing, no matter how nuMlest the individual offer- 
ings. The sonnets of Petrarch have had a mul- 
titudinous ]>rogeny, not all of whom liave done 
credit to their progenitor, and many a modern

THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



maiden has been the recipient of a form of trib- 
ute which might never have been thought of 
had it not been for the sonnets addressed to 
Madonna Laura six hundred years ago. The 
Canzoniere of Petrarch, that 'epitomised en- 
cyclopaedia of passion,' as Dr. Garnett calls it, 
is so precious a jewel among the world's poet- 
ical possessions that it predisposes us t-o a kindly 
indulgence of the feeblest of Petrarch's modern 
-followers. The 'Africa ' upon which the poet 
set his hopes of enduring fame has gone the 
way of all artificial epics, and of all mediaeval 
attempts to keep Latin alive as the medium of 
literary expression; but the odes, and the son- 
nets, and the trionfi, written in the despised 
vulgar tongue, have taken on with the succeed- 
ing centuries a more assured immortality. Of 
the influence of Petrarch upon the poetry of 
later ages, something is said in the special arti- 
cle which we print elsewhere ; we wish to devote 
our own brief remarks to the liumanist rather 
than to the poet, to the forerunner of the re- 
vival of learning rather than to the singer oi 
his own joys and sorrows. 

The Alpinists claim Petrarch as the first of 
their number by virtue of his famous ascent 
of Mont Yentoux. We doubt, however, if they 
can read with proper sympathy the letter in 
which the expedition is described. The mod- 
em mountain-climber is not likely to sit down 
in the first convenient valley and say to himself, 
' What thou hast repeatedly experienced to-day 
in the ascent of this mountain, happens to thee, 
as to many, in the journey toward the blessed 
life,' and then to indulge in a long retrospec- 
tive survey of his career. Nor is he apt, after 
having reached his summit, to take St. Augus- 
tine's ' Confessions ' from his pocket and ponder 
over its message. In Petrarch's case the effect 
was startling, for he hit upon the following pas- 
sage : ' And men go about to wonder at the 
heights of the mountains, and the mighty waves 
of the sea, and the wide sweep of rivers, and 
the circuit of the ocean, and the revolution of 
the stars, but themselves they consider not.' 
Whereupon, he says : ' I was abashed, and 

. . . closed the book, angry with myself 
that I should still be admiring earthly things 
who might long ago have learned from even the 
pagan philosophers that nothing is wonderful 
but the soul, which, when great itself, finds 
nothing great outside itself.' From that mo- 
ment, the panorama of hill-tops and clouds and 
skies meant no more to him than the view of 
Lake Leman had meant to Bernard of Clair- 
vaux. ' Then, in truth, I was satisfied that 1 
had seen enough of the mountain. I turned my 
inward eye upon myself, and from that time not 
a syllable fell from my lips until we reached the 
bottom again.' 

But Petrarch eoiild hardly have been ex- 



pected to climb his mountain in the modem 
spirit ; the significant thing is that he did such 
a thing at all. ' My only motive was the wish 
to see what so great an elevation had to offer,' 
is his simple prefatory statement. But we, 
knowing in how many things his thought 
groped imconsciously toward the future, may 
be pardoned for finding this exploit in a cer- 
tain sense symbolical, or at least highly suggest- 
ive of wliat we can now see to have been his 
relations to the development of culture. He 
cherished the past, — none more fondly than he, 
— but he never took the view that the sum of 
all possible culture had been made up by the 
ancients, leaving nothing for the coming ages 
to add. He knew not what those ages might 
bring forth ; but he had a wistful sense of their 
possibilities, which amounted almost to pre- 
science. 

The analysis of Petrarch's humanism reveals 
a number of distinct elements. He not only 
climbed the mountain, but he also travelled fai 
and wide, because he was genuinely curious 
about the world of nature and of men, and took 
a wholesome interest in things and affairs. He 
read the classical authors, not to find in them 
texts for disputation, but for the purposes of 
culture as we understand the term, and with a 
passionate enthusiasm for their beauty. He col- 
lected a library of some two hundred manuscript 
volumes, not for the reputation of owning them, 
but because they were for him the very bread and 
wine of the intellectual life. He even planned to 
bequeath his books to Venice for the general 
good, thus conceiving the modem idea of the 
public library. He wrote the most delightful 
letters to his friends, following the example of 
Pliny and Cicero, and he wrote them with an 
eye to their preservation for future generations. 
He even wrote a fragmentary autobiography; 
and, what is particularly noteworthy, he made 
it largely a record of his inner life, of his intel- 
lectual and emotional experiences. The course 
of his speculation was singularly self-deter- 
mined; he rejected the narrow educational 
ideals of his age, and made free to find flaws in 
the teaching of Aristotle, — not, indeed, calling 
him ' that accursed heathen,' as Luther was to 
do two centuries later, but flatly refusing to 
recognize his authority as pontifical. 

All these matters, as well as others unmen- 
tioned, bring Petrarch into closer touch with 
the modern world than any of his contempora- 
ries. Carducci makes him the intellectual ar- 
biter of his age, as Erasmus and Voltaire were 
the intellectual arbiters of theii-s; but that 
strictly historical fact appeals to us less directly 
than the fresh and sympathetic quality of his 
work. Tliose who would like to come into close 
contact with Petrarch the humanist, as distin- 
guished from Petrarch the poet, will do well

to read the volume of selections admirably 
translated and edited by Professors Eobinson 
and Eolfe, The English reader could have 
no better introduction than this to the man 
and his writings. The poems, of course, need 
no such introduction. There have been over 
four hundred editions of them in Italian alone, 
besides countless translations into numerous 
tongues. And of their author, now in his grave 
six hundred years less the three score and 
ten of his life, let our closing words be those 
of the contemporary who thus described his 
end : ' Francesco Petrarca, the mirror of our 
century, after completing a vast array of vol- 
umes, on reaching his seventy-first year closed 
his last day in his library. He was found lean- 
ing over a book as if sleeping, so that his death 
was not at first suspected by his household.' 



MODERN ECHOES OF PETRARCH. 



Each century brings new proof of the perma- 
nence of Petrarch 's influence and the charm of his 
poetry. As Italy celebrates, on the 20th of July, 
the six-hundredth anniversary of his birth, she 
challenges the world to name a literary hero 
who has won more sympathetic homage from 
cultured men and women of every age. Research 
during the last century has disclosed few new 
facts in Petrarch's life; but knowledge of his 
work, both as humanist and poet, has been widely 
disseminated. Earlier studies, by Abbe de Sade, 
Foscolo, Ginguene, and Sismondi, have been trans- 
lated and appreciated. In Italy and France many 
biographic and critical treatises have appeared; 
there have also been a few significant volumes by 
English and American scholars, from the biog- 
raphy by the poet Campbell in 1843 to more re- 
cent studies by Mr. Symonds, Mr. Reeve, and the 
collaborated work of Professors James Harvey 
Robinson and H. W. Rolfe. Other popular 
sketches, both in book and magazine form, have 
testified to the increasing interest in the romantic 
phases of Petrarch's life. More illuminative, 
both of the man and the poet, have been the 
translations of his sonnets, canzone, and letters, 
by such modern scholars as Hartley Coleridge, 
Walter Savage Landor, Mr. Richard Gamett, and 
Colonel T. W. Higginson. Indirect evidences of 
his literary influence abound. The Victorian poets 
and their successors made frequent allusions to 
him, and their works bear impress of his mode 
and spirit. 

No one would claim Petrarch as one of the 
world's greatest poets. But the duration of his 
popularity, and the acknowledged and indirect 
imitations of his style, give evidence of the pro- 
gressive quality of his influence. As the lover and 
sonneteer of Laura, as the patriot-friend of 
Rienzi and Colonna, as the enthusiast for pure 
classicism in an age of mental lethargy and 
pedantry, he merits the remembrance which has 
never waned from his day to our own. Without 



loss of his prestige as a scholar, he has won more 
general recognition as an amatory lyrist, com- 
bining the best elements of chivalrous worship for 
women with the conflicting passions of a modem 
lover. In the more than three hundred sonnets, 
and the scores of canzone and sestinas, celebrat- 
ing the charms and reserve of his mistress, pho- 
tographing the lover's struggles of heart and con- 
science, Petrarch has accomplished a work of 
poetic art more memorable than his cultural re- 
forms. There is an ever-new fascination in his 
revelations of this fourteenth-century woman^ 
with her soft dark eyes, her golden hair, her 
alluring voice, and her reposeful beauty of face 
and presence. Midway between the spiritual 
Beatrice and the sensual Fiametta, she is a hu- 
manized creation of rare charm. Whether she 
was in truth, as later authorities aver, the wife 
of Hugo de Sade and the mother of nine children, 
or only the personification of a poet's vision, she 
is essentially real yet ideal,— the mistress of 
feudal days, Avith the dominant traits of modern 
womanhood of a loftier type arousing in her 
lover's heart a conflict between reverence and 
yearning. 

While the last century has given attention 
chiefly to the love-poetry of Petrarch, it has not 
overlooked his qualities as a leader both in affairs 
and in letters. His Latin essays in available form 
for the modern scholar, his voluminous cor- 
respondence carefully edited and largely trans- 
lated, afford distinct signs of the directive force 
which he wielded in his OAvn age. Undoubtedly 
the time was ripe for his influence; but such 
consideration does not minimize his service. In^ 
ferior to Dante as a poet, and separated from him 
by less than a generation, he was eminently 
modern in spirit and mode, while Dante was the 
last noble exponent of mediaevalism. With all 
his breadth of insight, Petrarch was more than a 
scholar and a poet; he was the first true Italian 
patriot-prophet. With vanity and a proneness to 
servility, he possessed deep-rooted aspirations for 
political reform, in which are found many of the 
later tenets of patriotism. In his diplomatic mis- 
sions, in consultation with Pope and Doge, even 
in his ardent hope and disappointment in Rienzi, 
Petrarch was an idealist tempered by practical 
wisdom. Like Mazzini, his great compatriot of 
five hundred years later, Petrarch saw in his 
vision a free and united Italy, though it was his 
belief that this should come through a revival of 
Roman standards. For Petrarch, whose father had 
suffered exile from Florence, there was no specific 
city-allegiance; he was a patriot, not a partisan,

[July 16, 



_1901, certain ' Thoughts ' that well disclose 
Petrarch's moral and literary traits. Keen in- 
-Sight into humanity and into the fundamental 
'tr'fttlis of life are interwoven with intimate hints 
m personal experiences. A few pertinent epi- 
grams have special force,— as ' Nothing can suc- 
ceed in defiance of nature ' (Bk. IV: Letter 16) ; 
* Idleness alone causes us to disbelieve in our 
own powers' (Bk. XXI: Letter 10); 'Humble 
and earnest research is always the first step 
toward knowledge ' (Letters of Old Age; Bk. 
IV: Letter 5). 

Modern scholarship has not only found new 
meanings in Petrarch, but it has shown greater 
•discrimination in the study of his literary forms, 
iieigh Hunt's ' Book of the Sonnet/ in the midr 
■die of the nineteenth century, emphasized for 
English readers the perfection of Petrarch's 
verse and its many adaptations. To Mrs. Shelley 
lie wrote, in general tribute, * Petrarch and Boc- 
caccio and Dante are the morning and noon and 
night of the great Italian day; or, rather, Dante 
:and Petrarch and Boccaccio are the night and 
toorning and noon. — " And the evening and the 
■morning were the first day." ' (Dowden's * Life 
of Shelley,' IL, 220.) To Leigh Hunt we are 
indebted for one of the most musical transla- 
tions of Petrarch's * Ode to Vaucluse.' Hunt 
caught the playful spirit of the verse, and deli- 
cately portrayed the vision of Laura amid a 
shower of blossoms. Passing by occasional trib- 
utes to Petrarch in prose and verse, by Samuel 
Rogers, Barry Cornwall, Lord Houghton, Lord 
3H[amner, and other English scholars, one is re- 
'minded of the more significant allusions by that 
■coterie of poets to whom Italy was not alone a 
:goal of pilgrimage but a place of long and happy 
•sojourn. In 1813, Byron, in disgust at his own 
inability in sonnet form, had written : ' They are 
ithe most puling, petrifying, stupidly platonic 
•compositions. I detest the Petrarch so much that 
i would not be the man even to have obtained his 
Laura, which the metaphysical, whining dotard 
never could.' In ' Don Juan ' he interpolated a 
•characteristic sneei', — 

' Think you if Laura had been Petrarch's wife, 
He would have written sonnets all his life?" 

"When, however, chance brought Byron to the 
^uganean hills, he found himself moved to a 
tnore sympathetic note toward Petrarch and his 
adjacent home. In a somewhat skeptical mood, 
"tie paid his first visit to Arqua in 1817. He con- 
fessed that he was ' moved to turn aside in a 
second visit,' and two years later he urged the 
poet Moore ' to spare a day or two to go with 
ine to Arqua; I should like to visit that tomb 
with you,— a pair of poetical pilgrims, — eh, 
Tom, what say you? ' All are familiar with his 
^commemoration of ' the soft, quiet hamlet at 
"Vaucluse ' in 'Childe Harold ' (IV: xxx). 

Shelley had been under the spell of Petrarch's 
influence before he came to Italy, when, in 1813, 
lie joined his friend Hogg, and read the Italian 
poets in company with Mrs. Boinville and her 
■sentimental daughter Cornelia Turner. Shelley's 
learlier interest was revived under these close 
^associations, and in his * Defense of Poetry ' he 



spoke warmly of Petrai-ch, ' whose verses are as 
spells which unseal the inmost enchanted foun- 
tains of the delight which is in the grief of love. 
It is impossible to feel them without becoming a 
portion of that beauty which we contemplate.' 
Vaucluse became a pilgrim-shrine to the Brown- 
ings, from that first romantic scene pictured by 
Mrs. Jamieson, as well as by Mrs. Browning, 
when the poet-lovers * sate upon two stones in 
the midst of the fountain which in its dark prison 
of rocks flashes and roars and testifies to the 
memory of Petrarch.' In their Italian studies, 
the Brownings found Dante and Camoens more 
stimulating than Petrarch, though one recalls sig- 
nificant references to the latter in * Apparent 
Failure,' ' The Ring and the Book,' and * The 
Vision of Poets,' such as, 

' And Petrarch pale, 
From whose brain-lighted heart were thrown 
A thousand thoughts beneath the sun. 
Each lucid with the name of One.' 

For the most pronounced reflection of 
Petrarch's influence, one turns to Landor. At the 
outset, he challenges all English writers who have 
transformed his hero's name. ' For I pretend to 
no vernacular familiarity with a person of his 
distinction, and should almost be as ready to 
abbreviate Francesco into Frank as Petrarca into 
Petrarch.' The idea of ' The Pentameron ' may 
be traced to the letter sent by Petrarch to Boc- 
caccio after the latter had given him a copy of 
Dante and asked for a more sympathetic reading 
of the earlier master. That Petrarch recognized 
the mental superiority of Dante cannot be ques- 
tioned; but he confessed that he was repelled 
by two causes, — the severe adherence to med- 
iaeval standards, and a persistent memory of 
one glance, when he was eight years old, at the 
cold and rigorous face of Dante. Two other 
reasons for this indifference are suggested in 
Landor 's dialogue: first, Petrarch's youthful fear 
lest by reading Dante he should become a mere 
imitator; and, second, an objection to Dante's 
persistent use of the Italian rather than the 
Latin text for his lofty poetic vision. The na- 
tures of these great poets were too antithetical 
to be in accord, — leaving out all suggestions of 
Petrarch's vanity; and Landor has well de- 
lineated what Disraeli called ' Petrarch's caus- 
tic smile on Dante.' To Landor, the character 
of Petrarch was thus unfolded : ' Unsuspicious, 
generous, ardent in study, in liberty, in love, with 
a self-complacency which in less men woidd be 
vanity, but arising in him from the general ad- 
miration of a noble presence, from his place in 
the interior of a heart which no other could ap- 
proach or merit, and from the homage of all who 
held the principalities of Learning in every part 
of Europe.' 

The early studies and translations of Pe- 
trarch 's sonnets by Lord Morley, Major Mac- 
Gregor, Lord Surrey, Lady Dacre, and Susan 
Wollaston, are still valuable to the modern 
reader. During the last three decades, several 
volumes of translations and anthologies have ex- 
tended general study of the Petrarchan sonnet,— 
notably the anthologies by Samuel Waddington, 



1904.]

William Sharp, Dr. Richard Garnett, and the 
scientific treatise on the sonnet by Mr. Charles 
Tomlinson. In his recent volume of sonnets from 
Dante, Petrarch, and Camoens, Dr. Garnett has 
shown skill and poetic insight in his renderings 
of more than sixty Petrarchan sonnets. Espe- 
cially fine are the thirty-ninth, with the poet's 
benediction upon Laura; the eightieth, on Vau- 
cluse; and the second of the later memorial son- 
nets after the passing of Laura and his friend 
Colonna. Dr. Garnett has prefaced the transla- 
tions by an original sonnet of tribute, closely fol- 
lowing his model in structure and effective play 
upon the words Laura and Laurel : 

' Laurel In right of Laura thou didst claim, 
Which wreath Apollo with his bay enwound ; 
Nature with flower and wit with diamond crowned ; 
Thine were the wind, the dawn, the star, the flame.' 

Of American translators, none have rendered 
more scholarly and sympathetic sonnets by 
Petrarch and Camoens than Colonel Higginson. 
Some of these were included in his earlier volume 
of verse, ' The Afternoon Landscape '; and with 
them have been incorporated a few new trans- 
lations in the exquisite volume of this memorial 
year, ' Fifteen Sonnets of Petrarch.' Here also 
is reproduced the essay published in * The At- 
lantic ' many years ago, * Sunshine and Pe- 
trarch,' in which the earlier sonnets were im- 
bedded. The elusive memory of Laura's beauty, 
and the vacuity of mind after her death, have 
been retold with perfect sympathy in sonnet 251, 
* Gli occhi di eh' io parlai.' 

' Dead is the source of all my amorous strain. 
Dry is the channel of my thoughts outworn. 
And my sad heart can sound but notes of pain.' 

Deft in portrayal of the lighter fancies. Colonel 
Higginson has been even more successful in the 
deeper revelations of the spirit. With earnest 
grace he has interpreted the three hundred and 
twenty-third sonnet, the exaltation of Laura's 
womanliness and its admonition to maidenhood of 
all ages,— ' Qual donna atende a gloriosa fama.' 

' Doth any maiden seek the glorious fame 
Of chastity, of strength, of courtesy? 
Gaze in the eyes of that sweet enemy 
Whom all the world doth as my lady name! 
How honor grows and pure devotion's flame, 
How truth is joined with graceful dignity. 
There thou may'st learn, and what the path may be 
To that high heaven which doth her spirit claim ; 
There learn that speech beyond all poet's skill. 
And sacred silence, and those holy ways 
Unutterable, untold by human heart. 
But the infinite beauty that all eyes doth fill. 
This none can learn ; because its lovely rays 
Are given by God's pure grace, and not by art.* 

Though Petrarch's sonnets and songs can never 
be placed in the very first rank among world- 
poetry, yet there is an unwaning charm in the 
life and verse of this man of warm passion, of 
strenuous ambition for himself and the modern 
world. Refreshing the mind of his own age with 
draughts from the spring of classic letters, he 
speaks a message as pertinent to-day as when it 
issued from his romantic valley retreat, or was 
listened to by his flatterers at the Venetian court.

Personalities will continue to interest more 
than impersonalities, as long as human nature 
endures. The concrete is to most of us so 
much easier of apprehension than the abstract, 
that memoirs and reminiscences and (alas, that 
it should be so!) court scandals and back- 
stairs gossip are eagerly perused, while works 
on psychology and sociology and the history of 
institutions go begging for readers. This be- 
ing the case, and any immediate change for the 
better being beyond the book-reviewer's power 
to effect, he ought at least to single out, for 
that commendation which is implied in an ex- 
tended notice of the present kind, only such 
examples of personal history and anecdote as 
are most nearly free from malevolence, from 
frivolous tattle, and from petty detail of what- 
ever sort. In this more worthy and dignified 
class of biographic and autobiographic writing 
belongs Sir Mountstuart E. Grant Duff's vo- 
luminous but seldom unentertaining 'Diary,' 
some fresh ''Notes' from which, covering the 
years 1893-95, have recently appeared in two 
volumes convenient in size and appropriate in 
character for summer reading. With two more 
volumes the diarist hopes to bring his work 
down to the accession of the present King, thus 
covering a full half-century. In the instal- 
ment now published, as in the earlier ones, the 
author has, he tells us, ' resolutely kept to the 
less serious side of life,' and he purposes doing 
so to the end. A few notes from these 'Notes,' 
with such occasional comments as they may 
suggest, will perhaps suffice to introduce the 
book to the reader. 

No one was readier than Wordsworth him- 
self to admit his lack of humor; and, when 
we come to think of it, this is no slight evidence 
of the poet's candor and self-knowledge. Yet 
Browning held that Wordsworth did himself 
an injustice in this matter; for, according to 
the younger poet's report, when his engagement 
to Elizabeth Barrett was announced Words- 
worth exclaimed, 'Well! I suppose they un- 
derstand each other, although nobody under- 
stands them.' Strictly speaking, this should 
rather be classed as wit than as humor, being 
the discovery of an unexpected congruity, not 
the revelation of an unimagined and comical 
incongruity. Passing from Wordsworth to Syd- 
ney Smith, — an abrupt transition, — the Di- 
ary narrates the witty clergyman's last record-

ed joke. On being asked, a few days before 
his death, whether he had had a comfortable 
night, he replied, ' Yes ! I had a very pleas- 
ant dream, I dreamt that there would be in 
future thirty-nine Muses and only nine Ar- 
ticles.' 

A curious incident, ominous if we choose so 
to regard it, is related on the authority of an 
eye-witness. At the coronation of Charles X. 
of France, the crown slipped and was caught 
by the Duke of Orleans before it reached the 
ground. Another anecdote of Louis Philippe 
will be new to most readers. Ambassador Bay- 
ard told our diarist that the Duke, in the days 
of his first exile, ' found his way to Philadel- 
phia and started a business, chiefly in molasses, 
under the firm of " Orleans and Brother." It 
was unsuccessful, and the future King became 
a teacher of French in the family of Mr. Bay- 
ar'd's great-grandfather. He wished to marry 
one of the daughters, and a miniature of her 
from his hand is now in the possession of Mrs. 
John Field in Paris.' This great-grandfather, 
we infer, was Dr. James Asheton Bayard of 
Philadelphia, who died prematurely in 1770, 
twenty-five years or more before the incidents 
referred to. To another of our countrymen 
there is devoted a paragraph that probably 
makes unduly prominent certain of his less 
amiable traits which have been noted by pre- 
vious writers. 

' Our talk strayed to Lowell, so agreeable at 
his best, so much the reverse when, as too often, 
he bored his company by trying to prove that all 
men of ability had Jewish blood, or when that 
secret distrust of himself and his countrymen, 
which was his bane, overmastered his better 
nature and made him offensively self-assertive. 
Aberdare quoted some instances of this, but also 
his excellent advice to a young lady about to be 
married, which I have elsewhere noted: "Always 
give your husband — your way." ' 

When it comes to self-assertion, the English 
are well able to hold their own. This charge 
against Lowell recalls the greedy youngster who 
taunted his sister for taking the very piece 
of cake he had set his heart on. 

The author gives a list of highly interesting 
letters and papers examined by him at the Eec- 
ord Office, — among others the despatch con- 
taining an account of the battle of Blenheim, 
signed by Marlborough himself but written in 
another hand, a circumstance for which he 
apologizes in a postscript, saying that he was 
out of order for want of rest. In our day, 
when important communications are dictated 
to stenographer and typewriter, one would 
rather expect an apology for an autograph des- 
patch. How unconscious do we tend to be- 
come of the large part played by convention in 



all our customs ! Livingstone reported the ex- 
istence in central Africa of a tribe whose wom- 
en were greatly disgusted when he told them 
that in England it is customary for a man to 
have but one wife ; and Lubbock tells of an in- 
telligent Kandyan chief who was 'perfectly 
scandalised at the utter barbarism of living 
with only one wife, and never parting until 
sepfirated by death.' But this is a digression, 
though not an unpardonable one, it is hoped. 
An improved version of an old story is thus 
given by our diarist : 

' Most people have heard the story of the late 
Archbishop of Dublin exclaiming at a dinner- 
party in his deep voice: " It's come at last! it's 
come at last! " His horrified wife, springing up, 
asked: "What has come?" "Paralysis," replied 
her lord. " Paralysis! " she rejoined. " What can 
make you think that?" "I have been pinching 
my leg from time to time," was the answer, " for 
the last two minutes, and I can feel nothing." " I 
beg your Grace's pardon," said the lady who sat 
next to him, " you have been pinching mine." Miss 
Yonge told this, but made the recipient of the 
pinches — an Archdeacon! ' 

This anecdote, despite its mild flavor of im- 
propriety, is here quoted to offset another that 
has been marred rather than mended in the 
telling by our author. It is that story of a 
French misprint which Herbert Spencer gives 
in his * Autobiography ' ; and as his is an earlier 
and hence presumably a more authentic ver- 
sion, and as readers of light memoirs are not, 
in many cases at any rate, readers of Herbert 
Spencer, it may be worth while to record here 
the better form of the anecdote. Spencer had 
it from Louis Blanc not quite half a century 

ago. In a novel by a certain Comtesse X 

(Spencer withholds the lady's name) the nov- 
elist, wishing to point the moral of her tale in 
its closing sentence, had written, ' Bien connai- 
tre I'amour il faut sortir de soi.' The printer 
made of this, ' Bien connaitre I'amour il faut 
sortir le soir.' 

Some schoolboy answers to examination ques- 
tions are given on the authority of the exam- 
iner or other responsible person. Two of these 
ingenious stupidities are worth quoting. Ques- 
tion : ' Enumerate the principle battles between 
Marston Moor and Naseby.' Answer : ' General 
Marston Moor and General Naseby repeatedly 
encountered each other; but at last General 
Naseby defeated his opponent in a great bat- 
tle, and Marston Moor was left dead upon the 
field.' Question: 'Explain Lupercalia.' An- 
swer: ' Lupercalia was the name of the she- 
wolf who nursed Romeo and Juliet.' 

Finally, let us note the witty or otherwise 
memorable dying utterances of sundry celebrat- 
ed men, as jotted down here and there in the

Disraeli's death-bed, we learn that when the

declaring, ' I think the old gentleman is gone

the Horace Smith of the ' Rejected Addresses,' 
— was asked, as he lay dying, whether he would

The Duel, of Sex.* 



Just six years ago, a writer in this journal, 
lured by the fascination of * Candida,' was 
tempted to say that he almost regretted that 
the poet in the play was not lame, or some- 
thing of the sort, so that it might have been 
acted. When this regret was expressed, ' Can- 
dida' had, I believe, already been put on a 
few times in England by Mr. J. T. Grein's ' In- 
dependent Theatre,' in a propagandist tour 
through the provinces with Ibsen's 'A Doll's 
House.' It evoked little comment, however; 
and Mr. Shaw's disappointment was all the 
greater when Richard Mansfield, who had al- 
ready put the play in rehearsal in America, was 
compelled to abandon it, owing to the physical 
difficulties of impersonating the eighteen-year- 
old pre-Raphaelite poet. 

While ' Candida ' had been played several 
times in the English provinces, it had never 
been seen in London, except for a representa- 
tion by the Stage Society, until April 26 of the 
present year, when the first of seven afternoon 
performances of this play was presented at the 
Court Theatre. The press notices were very 
inadequate and misleading, which prompted 
Mr. William Archer's recent reproof of the 
English critics for their failure to report what 
happened at these performances, — namely, 
that everyone was highly interested, amused, 
and edified. 

Except for a performance by th e Browning

Society of Philadelphia last year, and one other 
performance by amateurs, ' Candida ' had not 
been seen in America until December 8 last, 
when Mr. Arnold Daly and his company gave 
their first matinee performance in JSTew York. 
It was soon transferred to the evening bill, and 
more than a hundred and fifty consecutive per- 
formances were given in that city alone. On 
April 23, the company went on the road, and 
duplicated, in Boston and elsewhere, the New 
York success. ^ The Man of Destiny,' a one- 
act piece by Mr. Shaw, was also added to Mr. 
Daly's repertory. 

The appearance of Mr. Shaw's new play, 
' Man and Superman,' just now is especially 
timely. The ' Candida ' performances in both 
England and America not only pleased their 
immediate audiences, but have given wide pub- 
licity to Mr. Shaw's claims as a dramatist, espe- 
cially as a dramatist who has expressed the con- 
fident belief that the public had brains and 
wanted to think. The new book will make a 
considerable demand upon the brains of the 
public, and in order to understand it they will 
have to think, whether they want to or not. 

The modem three-act play, which makes up 
only a little over a third of Mr. Shaw's new 
book, was written at the suggestion of Mr. A. 
B. Walkley, dramatic critic of the 'London 
Times,' a friend and former fellow-worker with 
Mr. Shaw in the field of criticism. So the new 
volume is dedicated to Mr. Walkley in a 
lengthy 'Epistle Dedicatory,' which gives the 
philosophic rationale of its evolution and con- 
struction. Mr. Walkley wished his friend to 
write a Don Juan play, and Mr. Shaw has 
chosen to interpret Don Juan's character in 
the modem philosophic sense. The Don Juan, 
invented early in the sixteenth century by a 
Spanish monk, thrown upon the stage by Mo- 
liere, interpreted spiritually by Mozart, and in- 
adequately represented in Byron's fragment, 
has long since become an obsolete type. Even 
Goethe's Faust, the spiritual cousin of Don 
Juan, although he had passed far beyond mere 
love-making into altruism and humanitarian- 
ism, was still almost a century out of date. 

Moreover, the modem society play, in which 
the woman defies the law regulating the relation 
of the sexes, land the man marries her in de- 
fiance of the convention which discountenances 
the woman, did not suit Mr. Shaw's purpose 
any better because, even though preoccupied 
with sex, it is really void of all sexual interest. 
The Don Juan of tradition and drama and op- 
era being antedated, the modern so-called sex- 
drama debarred, and the play of mere libertin- 
ism excluded for obvious reasons, Mr. Shaw 
was driven to the conclusion that Don Juan in 
the philosophic sense was his only alternative.

THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



The reductio ad absurdum process forced him 
to present the modem type of Don Juan, who 
*does actually read Schopenhauer and Nietz- 
sche, studies Westermarck, and is concerned for 
the future of the race instead of for the free- 
dom of his own instincts/ 

But when Mr. Shaw was confronted with the 
problem of the duel of sex, he solved it with 
the typically Shawesque conclusion that Man is 
no longer, like Don Juan, the victor in that 
duel. Woman has become not only powerful, 
but even aggressive and dangerous. She cov- 
ertly takes the initiative in the selection of her 
mate. Don Juan is transformed from pursuer 
into pursued. Thus the new play is, in Mr. 
Shaw's words, ' a stage projection of the tragi- 
comic love chase of the man by the woman.' 

Ann Whitefield, a modern English girl, se- 
cures the appointment of the friend of her 
childhood, John Tanner, as one of her guar- 
dians, by her father's will, in the hope of using 
the relation as a lever for her intrigues to win 
him. John Tanner, alias Don Juan de Tenorio, 
a pen-picture of Mr. Shaw himself, perfectly 
fulfils the definition of the philosophic Don 
Juan. His chauffeur, 'Enry Straker, alias Le- 
porello, first opens his eyes to the machinations 
of Ann. But this Ann is no Merely Mary Ann, 
and Tanner, seeing that his only safety is in 
flight, takes wings — otherwise his automobile 
— and speeds to Granada, 

Unhampered by the proverbial ^scrupulous- 
ness ' of woman, — that is, with total disregard 
of masculine fastidiousness, — Ann, in com- 
pany with a party of her friends, starts in pur- 
suit. Although Tanner declares to her, when 
they meet, that he will not marry her, that he 
was appointed her guardian, not her suitor, that 
marriage to him means loss of freedom and in- 
dividuality, his declarations go for naught. For 
he is at last in the grip of the Life Force. Ann's 
will has conquered his, for the motive-power 
of her will is that Life Force, the genuine sex- 
ual instinct that brooks no denial or defeat. 

Goethe recognized the existence of an eternal 
womanly principle in the imiverse. Mr. Shaw 
has now written a play to show that Woman 
leads Man onward and upward — ^.hy the nose. 
He has stripped things bare of their amoristic 
halo, and brought us face to face with the stark 
problem of sex. One of his strongest convic- 
tions was expressed years ago in these words: 
' To me the tragedy and comedy of life lie in 
the consequences, sometimes terrible, sometimes 
ludicrous, of our persistent attempts to found 
our institiitions on the ideals suggested to 
our imaginations by our half-satisfied passions, 
instead of on a genuinely scientific natural his- 
tory.' In the new play he has chosen to sub- 
rait his own view of the existing relations of 
men and women, in the most highly civilized 



society, for what it is worth. He has dealt with 
love, not from the idealistic side of ^romantic 
nonsense, erotic ecstacy, or the stern asceticism 
of satiety,' but from the observational and em- 
piric standpoint of pure science in physics. The 
new play, which throws into the familiar order 
of cause and effect a certain body of fact and 
experience, may possibly interest the public; 
but it is more probable, Mr. Shaw believes, that 
it will pass at a considerable height over its 
'simple, romantic head.' Daring more and 
more to be a realist as time passed, Mr. Shaw 
has now taken the last step. With amazing 
boldness, he has finally laid hands on a mask, 
which the idealists have always feared to lose 
and fought to retain. 

One other thing is of sufficient interest to 
note. Mr. Shaw has complained of many dram- 
atists, the moidems especially, on account of 
their failure to realize in character the impres- 
sion they seek to produce. You arp told that 
someone is a great politician, a great architect, 
a great financier ; but there is nothing especial- 
ly definitive about the character to support and 
enforce that ah extra estimate. Dissatisfied 
with such a feeble evasion, Mr. Shaw has not 
only stated that his hero wrote a revolutionist's 
handbook, — he has given the handbook in full 
at the end of the play. Unwilling also to de- 
prive his friend Walkley of the pleasure of an- 
other glimpse of the ' Mozartian dissoluto puni- 
to and his antagonist the statue,' he has inserted 
in his modem play a totally extraneous act in 
which the Mozartian Don Juan, in a ' Shavio- 
Socratic dialogue,' philosophizes at great length 
with the lady, the statue, and the devil. The 
discussion of philosophy and sociology, with 
which the superflous act and the revolutionist's 
handbook almost wholly deal, is left for a phil- 
osophic socialist of the most pronounced Shavi- 
anism. 

The play of ideas, the drama of edification, is 
the ideal Mr. Shaw has set up for himself. In- 
deed, he believes that the drama can never be 
anything else. The new play, although handled 
in suitably decorous fashion, certainly escapes 
Mr. William Archer's pointed indictment of the 
' bloodless erotics ' of Mr. Bernard Shaw. It 
remains the drama of ideas, although frankly 
concerned with the problem of sex. ' To Life, 
the force behind the Man, intellect is a neces- 
sity, because without it he blunders into death.' 
But intellect without will is impotent ; and the 
victory in the duel of sex goes to Woman, for 
her intellect is engineered by the force of ir- 
resistible will. The Life Force within her is 
supreme, and, as Maeterlinck so beautifully 
says, ' The first kiss of the betrothed is but the 
seal which thousands of hands, craving for 
birth, have impressed upon the lips of the moth- 
er they desire.' Akchibald Henderson".

The Moorish Empire in Europe.* 

In the earlier centuries of the Middle Ages, 
it seemed as if the end of all civilization had 
come. Tribes and nations numbering thou- 
sands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of bar- 
barous men were wandering hither and thither 
through the Mediterranean lands in quest of 
suitable homes. The story of the Germanic 
migrations is well known; few subjects in his- 
tory have been studied with greater patience 
and care. We are, however, likely to forget 
that all the nations that migrated in those days 
were not Germanic. Two or three years after 
the Lombards had entered Italy, there was 
bom in a distant Arabian city the great 
Mohammed whose followers in due time came 
to demand their share of European soil. 

It seems that no earlier scholar has attempted 
to write in English anything like a detailed 
account of the Moorish empire in Europe. 
Prescott and Irving, among others, have writ- 
ten entertainingly of the last days of Saracen 
in'dependence ; but theirs is not the picture of 
a nation in the fullness of conquering power, 
— they tell the story of a dying race. Eecently, 
however, an American student, Mr. S. P. Scott, 
has undertaken to present the entire history of 
this interesting people. * This work has 
engaged the attention of the author for more 
than twenty years. Its object is an attempt to 
depict the civilization of that great race whose 
achievements in science, literature and the arts 
have been the inspiration of the marvellous 
progress of the present age.' The work is in 
three large volumes of about seven hundred 
pages each. In the first volume the author 
traces the history of the Moors down to the 
middle of the eighth century. The Arabic 
home, Mohammed, the rise of Islam and its 
conquering progress from Pamir to the Atlas 
region, are the subjects of the first few chap- 
ters. A chapter is devoted to the Visigothic 
monarchy in Spain, and then follows the 
account of Tarik's invasion in 711, the estab- 
lishment of the emirate, and the beginnings, of 
the new Christian state in the ravines and 
gorges of Asturia. The history of the emirate 
during the forty-five years of its existence is 
told quite circumstantially, perhaps unneces- 
sarily so. The second half of the volume tells 
the story of the Khalifate of Cordova from the 
coming of the first Ommeyade in 756 to the 
end of the dynasty in 1012. Under the Khalifs, 
Saracen Spain reached the meridian of her 
prosperity and glory. But in the eleventh cen- 
tury disaster befell the Ommeyades; the last 
survivor of the royal line mysteriously disap- 
peared, and the empire collapsed. The second

By S. P. Scott. In three volumes. Philadelphia: J. B. 
Llppincott Co. 



volume continues the history of the fragments^ 
closing with the conquest of Granada in 1492. 

The civilizing infiuence of the Moorish peo- 
ple is the principal theme of volume III. In 
glowing terms the author recounts the wonder- 
ful achievements of the Arabic mind. * From 
Moorish sources . . . were derived those- 
maxims of chivalry which modified the turbu- 
lent barbarism of feudal Europe, the courteous 
gallantry of the tournament, idolatrous devo- 
tion to the female character, a high sense of 
honor and personal dignity, and the refining^ 
amenities of social life. From these originals- 
sprang the germ of modem literature and the 
earliest models of modem poetry. 
Through the schools of Montpellier and Saler- 
no, contemporaneous seats of learning and 
both dominated by Arabian influence, the 
philosophy of Averroes, the botany of Ibn-Bei- 
thar, the surgery of Abulcasis, the agriculture 
of Ibn-al-Awam, the histories of Ibn-al-Kha- 
tib, became familiar to the benighted and priest- 
ridden people of Europe.' All this, and much 
more, Mr. Scott claims for the Moors as an 
educative influence in the West. At the same 
tim,e he tries to minimize the effects of the Cru- 
sades as a factor in European civilization. In 
many respects this volume is the most valuable 
part of Mr. Scott's work. Modern civilization 
is, indeed, a composite product to which the 
learning and experience of Arabic Spain have 
largely contributed, though perhaps not so 
extensively as our author would have us believe 

For an undertaking such as this, Mr. Scott 
seems to be eminently qualified. To an evident 
knowledge of the Eomance and Oriental lan- 
guages, he adds an intimate acquaintance with 
the region where the Saracen empire flourished. 
He sympathizes with the Arab race; he under- 
stands the Arab spirit; he appreciates the 
literature of the desert; he knows the precepts 
of Islam. From one who can bring to his task 
such thorough scholarship and such genuine 
enthusiasm we should expect a masterpiece. 

These qualities alone, however, do not make 
the historian. That the author has made a thor- 
ough study of his subject cannot be doubted. 
The annalistic field of the Middle Ages is 
largely barren soil ; and yet Mr. Scott has been 
able to collect a great mass of interesting mate- 
rials. But the manner in which these materials 
are built up into a historical narrative is open 
to serious criticism. His work is clearly 
intended to be what is commonly called a 
popular history; as it has no foot-notes and is 
very poorly indexed, it will prove something 
of a disappointment to the scholar who may try 
to use it. In matters of chronology it is also 
seriously wanting. From the dates given at 
the head of each chapter, the reader may know- 
approximately when the recorded event

occurred, but only occasionally does the text 
furnish an exact date. 

One needs not be a critic to discover that the 
work is far too extensive. This is due in part 
to the author's diffused style, and in part to 
his habit of commenting freely on almost every 
subject discussed. He has also included a great 
many things that a conscientious historian 
would omit. Mere suspicions and exploded 
myths should not be given a place on a page 
devoted to serious history. Nor is it necessary 
for a historian to express an opinion on every 
conceivable subject that may be drawn into the 
narrative. In chapter XXVII. the author 
turns aside from his general purpose to give 
his readers a little insight into the conditions 
of Christian Europe during the Middle Ages. 
This is, of course, done for the purpose of con- 
trast; but the treataient of the matter is as 
unfair as it is admittedly superficial. The 
whole chapter, with large sections of other chap- 
ters, should have been omitted as unnecessary 
and irrelevant materials. Almost every page 
of Mr. Scotf s work is in need of literary com- 
pression. By removing superfluous padding the 
three volumes could easily be reduced to two, 
and appreciation of what seems to be a solid 
and valuable piece of work would be greatly 
increased therebv. Laurence M. Larson.

choose to write. Now, after all these years, he 
reverts to the method, and even to the plan, of 
his first successful book, and gives us in ' The 
Veil of the Temple ' a ripened dramatic discus- 
sion of the fundamental problems of belief. 
Again we have the country-house and its urbane 
host, again we have the guests and the daily 
symposia which give them occasion to set forth 
their respective points of view, and again we 
have the thinly-disguised personalities of cer- 
tain well-known thinkers. And it may be 
added that we have again the amusing by-play, 
the touches of humanity, the covert satire, and 
the erotic suggestiveness that gave the earlier 
work a spice and savor of its own. The case 
of Miss Sinclair, who in ' The New Republic ' 
brought confusion to the good Dr, Jenkinson 
by asking if Greek love-poems were very hard 
to translate, finds a pendant in ' The Veil of 
the Temple' when Lord Restormel breaks off 
abruptly his paraphrase of the Song of Songs 
by saying, ' I didn't get any farther than that.' 
To which Lady Snowdon replies: *And I'm 
sure it was a very good thing you didn't.' These 
diversions, however, are infrequent, and the 
temper of the whole work is far more serious 
than that of its predecessor. For this reason, 
and for its failure to bag so interestingly con- 
trasted a collection of personalities as rewarded 
the sport of ' The New Republic,' the new book 
fails to eclipse the old one, and is greatly its 
inferior in piquancy, animation and deft satiri- 
cal humor. It shows, nevertheless, the same 
diabolical cleverness of intellectual mimicry, 
and has of course the advantage of dealing with 
the phases of religious thought presented to our 
own time as distinguished from those most evi- 
dent a full generation ago. Of actual person- 
alities, only two, — those of Herbert Spencer 
and Mr. Frederic Harrison, — are obviously 
recognimble to the world at large; the others 
may be described, — as the Philistine material- 
ist, the Hegelian idealist, and the sensuous 
dilettante, — instead of having definite names 
affixed to them. In his portrayal of the syn- 
thetic philosopher and the positivist, and of the 
several clerical types introduced, Mr. Mallock 
verges more than once upon caricature, and 
indulges in spiteful flings of the sort with 
which readers of ' The New Republic ' are suffi- 
ciently familiar. The seasoned reader of Mr. 
Mallock's many writings knows that his chief 
delight is in pulling the strings that make his 
puppets work, and that the showman himself 
never ventures into the open. Rupert Glan- 
ville, the host of the present company, clearly 
speaks for the author, and all that he can do 
in the end by way of extricating us from the 
philosophical tangle takes the form of a weak 
resort to something like Kant's doctrine of the 
practical reason, — a self-confessed impotence

to adopt any basic set of ideas, or to meet with 
any sort of logic the logic of his opponents. 
We expected nothing more than this, and con- 
sequently cannot urge the disappointment that 
will doubtless be felt by many readers of the 
present work. This lack of conviction on the 
part of the author of course reduces the whole 
book to a kind of ingenious dialectic exercise, 
and prevents it from being considered a serious 
contribution to thought. But for all that, it 
is vastly entertaining and even stimulating to 
the thoughtful mind, and will at least serve to 
arouse the dullest reader from his sluggishness. 
This is the only apology we have to offer for 
directing attention to it in a review of current 
fiction, for it is only by an extraordinary exten- 
sion of the meaning of the term that we may 
regard the book as being fiction at all. 

Mr. Chesterton's first essay in fiction takes 
the form of a whimsical romance of London 
in the twenty-first century. Externally, the 
metropolis is described as not greatly differing 
in appearance from the present, but in spirit 
the years have brought a vast change. The les- 
son of social evolution has been learned and 
taken to heart; men no longer try to make 
changes by violence, and democracy has ceased 
to be a passionate faith with any considerable 
number of people. Life has grown apathetic 
and mechanical, and the king is chosen by lot. 
Just at the time when the story opens, chance 
has selected for monarch a certain dry humorist 
by the name of Auberon Quin. Casting about 
for the wherewithal of a sensation, this person- 
age devises a plan for the restoration of the 
ancient autonomy of the cities of which London 
is the coalescence, and for the revival, at the 
same time, of all the pomp and ceremony and 
gorgeous trappings of mediaevalism. The plan 
goes into effect, and soon has an unforeseen 
consequence. A young fanatic named Adam 
Wayne, who becomes Provost of Notting Hill, 
takes the thing seriously, and, when certain 
men of affairs seek to open a new thoroughfare 
through his territory, resists by force of arms, 
repulses the invaders by ingenious strategy that 
depends mainly upon control of the gas-works 
and the water supply, and thus firmly estab- 
lishes himself in the position of dictator. 
Aroused by his example, the other cities begin to 
take seriously the new mediaevalism, and pres- 
ently we have a transformed London, no longer 
a civic unity, but a congeries of rival 
municipalities under the hegemony of Not- 
ting Hill. The king, meanwhile, surprised at 
the consequences of his whim, watches the new 
developments with amused curiosity and sar- 
donic interest. In the end (of the story), many 
years later, Notting Hill is attacked by a league 
of the foes raised up by Wayne's arrogant dic- 
tatorship, and this time successfully invaded 



and crushed. But the idea for which it stood 
is not vanquished, since London has been per- 
manently transformed into a centre of vivid 
and picturesquely romantic life. Mr. Chester- 
ton has developed this invention with an admir- 
ably humorous philosophy, and found in it the 
opportunity for a renewed exercise of his 
peculiar talent for startling paradox. 

'Eomance,' which is a big new book by Mr. 
Joseph Conrad, written with the collaboration 
of Mr. Ford Madox Hueffer, takes us from 
England to the haunts of the Cuban bucca- 
neers, and gives us a striking series of pictures 
set in that lawless environment. The time is 
only a hundred years ago, too late for an exhibi- 
tion of the full fiower of pirate enterprise, yet 
not sufficiently modern to plunge us into the 
age of humdrum respectability. We call the 
book a series of pictures, for such it is rather 
than a coherent and skilfully-planned romance. 
The pictures are satisfactorily vivid, the situa- 
tions have strong dramatic quality, and the fig- 
ures are drawn with the power of characteriza- 
tion that we have learned to expect from Mr. 
Conrad's genius. Certainly in respect to both 
characterization and diction, the hand is Mr. 
Conrad's; the hand of his fellow-craftsman is 
probably to be found in the working-out of the 
plot and in the swing of the narrative. The 
book as a whole is rather disappointing, despite 
its many remarkable qualities. But although 
it does not satisfy as a piece of construction, 
youthful readers will find their account in its 
panorama of breathless adventure, while the 
older and more discriminating will be well 
rewarded by its brilliant style and wealth of 
incisive detail. 

Mr. Quillor-Couch's ' Fort Amity ' is a his- 
torical romance of the French and Indian war, 
leading up to the victory of Quebec, although 
that crowning achievement is glimpsed rather 
than described, and reached by indirection 
rather than by the novelist's straightforward 
attack. The hero is a young English officer who 
is captured at Ticonderoga, and thus cut off 
from participating in the deed of his com- 
panions-at-arms. His captivity throws him 
among Indians and Frenchmen, and even after 
he escapes from his bonds, he remains in their 
companionship, allured in part by the charms 
of wild forest life, and in part by the even more 
potent charms of one Madamoiselle Diane, a 
daughter of the foe. All of these complica- 
tions bring us to a properly romantic conclu- 
sion, but the residual impression of the story is 
vague and disappointing. 

Welcome indeed, and all the more welcome 
because of its unheralded coming, is the new 
novel of the genial Dutchman who calls him- 
self ' Maarten Maartens ' for literary purposes. 
This author is not of those who have their 



38

doings chronicled from day to day, and who 
resort to the puff preliminary and other devices 
known to the advertising novelist; he is the 
sort of man who works without observation 
until a new masterpiece is completely shaped, 
and then bestows it without trumpeting upon 
the world. The new novel is called ' Dorothea: 
A Story of the Pure in Heart/ and is indeed 
a masterpiece. It is fairly upon the level of 
' God's Fool ' and ' The Greater Glory/ which 
amounts to saying that it is a work that few 
living writers of English fiction could hope to 
equal, and possibly none surpass. To sketch 
the story in outline would be so ineffectual a 
way of conveying an impresBion of its beauty 
and strength that we shall not make the 
attempt, beyond saying that it tells of a half- 
Dutch half-English maiden, whose girlhood, 
secluded from all evil thoughts, is passed in 
rural Holland, and who is suddenly transported 
into the world — the world of fashion and folly 
and wretchedness as. it may be seen in France 
and Italy and Germany. The story itself, 
although strictly private in its interest, is skil- 
fully contrived, and has enough of plot to hold 
the attention. But the real charm of the book 
is to be sought in its vital delineation of a great 
variety of characters, its many-colored portrayal 
of life, and the unfailing tenderness and purity 
of its idealism. It is a book to take to one's heart, 
a book to make one grateful to the author for 
writing it, a book that makes the world better 
for its existence. 

A sharper contrast could not easily be found 
than is offered when we set ' The Woman With 
the Fan ' by the side of the work just reviewed. 
We are introduced by both novels to the same 
general sort of sophisticated society, but the 
writers view their subject from opposite sides, 
and the optimistic human outlook of ' Maarten 
Maartens ' is replaced by the hard and unlovely 
cynicism of Mr. Hichens. The latter writer, 
Indeed, has already taught us what to expect 
from him. He takes a mean view of life, and 
its morbid aspects are to him typical manifesta- 
tions of human character. He has an epigram- 
nuatic manner which gives a certain superficial 
clevemess to his work, but which in the long 
run proves distressful. This latest novel of his 
depicts a woman of fashion, her jealous and 
brutal husband, and her various lovers. Be- 
coming disfigured by an accident, she drinks 
the very dregs of bitterness as her lovers faU 
from her one by one; for the author's thesis 
seems to be that physical beauty is everything 
in a woman, and that men's protestations of 
their love for her intellectual or spiritual quali- 
ties are mere hollowness or self-delusions» The 
book is hopelessly lacking in naturalness and 
in anything like elevation of sentiment. It 
leaves a bad taste not easily to be forgotten. 



Mr. Winston Churchill's new novel gives us 
a picturesque panorama of the movement of 
westward expansion that began when the first 
hardy pioneers crossed the mountains in pre- 
Bevolutionary times, occupying not without dif- 
ficulty the dark and bloody ground of Kentucky, 
and that was consummated a generation later 
by the raising of the United States flag over 
the Louisiana Territory. It introduces us inci- 
dentally to Boone and his fellow-fighters, makes 
much of Clark's conquest of the Northwest, car- 
ries us through the period of Western disaffec- 
tion marked by intrigues with Spain and the 
brief history of the State of Franklin, and leads 
us in the end to the secret transfer of Louisiana 
from Spain to France, and the final obliteration 
of European control over the Mississippi and its 
Western shores. Here is matter enough and to 
spare for the outfitting of a historical romance, 
and Mr. Churchill has skilfully brought it all 
into a sort of unity by linking it with the for- 
tunes of his imaginary hero. ' The Crossing ' 
is the fitting title of this narrative, for all of 
its episodes follow logically enough from the 
crossing of the Alleghanies by those first haxdy 
pioneers. The historical figures presented to us 
include Boone, Sevier, Robertson, Wilkinson, 
Andrew Jackson, and, foremost among them, 
George Eogers Clark. Upon his delineation of 
that stout-hearted and daring Virginian Mr. 
Churchill has expended his best powers, follow- 
ing the ' Memoirs ' quite Literally, yet drawing 
with their aid a portrait of fine artistic quality. 
We have both the Clark of the Cahokia and 
Vincennes expeditions, resourceful, command- 
ing, a natural leader of men, and the Clark of 
later years, embittered by his treatment, grown 
infirm of will, and feebly plotting against the 
government that had rewarded his great ser- 
vices so ill. It is a strong and truthful account 
of a striking personality. The fictitious hero of 
all these scenes begins to be heroic at a very 
tender age. He is a boy in Charleston when 
Colonel Moultrie defends the island fort, and 
is still a boy amid the scenes of Indian warfare 
in Kentucky. He goes with Clark's expedition 
to Vincennes, being identified with the drum- 
mer-boy of the ' Memoirs,' and is carried 
through the water on the shoulders of one of 
the men. In the later chapters, of course, he 
reaches manhood, becomes a skilful lawyer and 
a stout Federalist, and ends somewhat surpris- 
ingly by marrying an emigree — a French mar- 
quise of the Old Regime. That is, he ends for 
the purposes of the present novel, but with so 
much youth and ambition left that we should 
not be at all surprised to find him figuring 
once more in some later and consequent work 
of Mr. Churchill. 'The Crossing' is a thor- 
oughly interesting book, packed with exciting 
a;dventure and sentimental incident, yet faith-

f ul to historical fact both in detail and in spirit. 
It is a capital book for youthful readers espe- 
cially, because it makes vivid a section of our 
national history to which the text-books rarely 
give adequate attention. 

One of the soldiers who was with Clark at 
Vincennes is the hero of Mr. Sprague's ' Felice 
Constant.' He makes his way to Detroit, spies 
upon the British garrison there, and becomes 
entangled in the affections of two young women. 
This embarrassing situation is relieved when 
one of them turns out to be his long-lost sis- 
ter. Under the circumstances, we see no par- 
ticular reason why she should have to die in 
the hour of this revelation, but the author seems 
to have thought it necessary. The story has 
the conventional villain, conventionally thwart- 
ed, and is agreeably supplied with exciting 
adventures. It fairly reeks with fine language 
and luscious sentiment, and is about as unreal 
as it is possible for such a story to be. 

Mr. Allen French's first book of fiction was 
a historical romance of the American Eevolution. 
His second, now published, and entitled ' The 
Barrier,' is a novel of modem American society, 
business, and politics, as these exist in a New 
England city of moderate size. The central 
figure is that of a promoter who, by unscrupu- 
lous methods, has made himself a power in the 
business and political life of the community, 
and who seeks to round out his achievements by 
the conquest of the local society. Here, how- 
ever, he finds difficulties of a kind new to his 
experience, and it is the unexpected ' barrier ' of 
caste and gentle breeding now standing in his 
path that gives to the novel its title. There is 
an interesting heroine, a daughter of the aris- 
tocracy, and the scheming promoter seeks to 
make her his wife, partly because of her per- 
sonal attraction for him, and partly because 
that seems to be the most effective way of real- 
izing his social ambitions. She, impressed by 
his masterful ways, and revolting against her 
own contracted and conventional environment, 
is almost persuaded to join her fortunes with 
his, but is saved at the last moment by a reveal- 
ing light cast upon some of his sinister activi- 
ties. Of the other characters, some axe well- 
studied and others are not; but there are enough 
of them to provide a variety of interesting com- 
plications, and to furnish forth a book that is at 
least thoroughly readable. 

* It appears to the writer that there is urgent 
need of more " nature books " — books that are 
scraped clear of fiction and which display only 
the carefully articulated skeleton of fact.' With 
these prefatorjr words Mr. Kobert W. Chambers 
lures the innocent reader to investigate a col- 
lection of the wildest yarns ever spun by a wool- 
gathering imagination. The work is a continu- 
ous narrative only in the sense that the same 



susceptible young naturalist figures in its sev- 
eral episodes, which are otherwise distinct sto- 
ries. In the first of them he discovers a living 
family of great auks and a strange amphibious 
monster of semi-human attributes. In the next, 
he finds the '^dingue' and the mammoth disport- 
ing in the wilds of Labrador. The Tasmanian 
ux is next exploited, and five of its eggs (as 
large as hogsheads) are actually hatched in 
sight of an international congress of natural- 
ists held in Paris. The sea-serpent next claims 
our excited attention, and then we go to the 
Everglades in search of jelly-fish women, invis- 
ible to the ordinary sense, but having a very 
material taste for apple-pie, and almost cap- 
tured by reason of that weakness. The last 
story is a wondrous farrago of nonsense about 
transmigration and astral bodies in which tlie 
hero discovers a cat to be his great-aunt, a fact 
which makes his family relations embarrassingly 
complicated. Each one of these tales introduces 
an attractive young woman who works tempo- 
rary havoc with the affections of the naturalist, 
but since he recovers as promptly as he falls a 
victim, we need not make him the object of any 
very deep S3rmpathies. We trust, with Mr. 
Chambers, that this work ^may inspire enthu- 
siasm for natural and scientific research, and 
inculcate a passion for accurate observation 
among the young.' 

A work of fiction that oomes dangerously 
near to being a record of fact is * The Magnetic 
North,' by Miss Elizabeth Robins. It is a story 
of the rush to the Klondyke in 1897, and, while 
we do not suppose that the experiences related 
were exactly those of any particukr set of 
adventurers, the narrative is so realistic and so 
minutely circumstantial that it might well be 
an account of the hardships actually undergone 
by a party of prospectors during the twelve- 
month following the news of that famous 
* strike.' The essential truthfulness of the 
story is apparent upon every page, and there 
is absolutely no effort to strain the credulity or 
to introduce sensational matter for the sake of 
dramatic effect. We have simply a matter-of- 
fact chronicle of the journey up the Yukon, of 
the daily life of the winter camp, and of the 
journey's end the summer following. We judge 
that the author has been on the spot, for she 
could hardly have pieced together at a distance, 
and from the tales of travellers, so vivid and 
veracious a tale. There is no little art in the 
telling, for Miss Robins is a practiced hand in 
novel-writing, but we feel that in this instance 
she has acted upon the principle that truth is 
more interesting, if not exactly stranger, than 
fiction, and that she has been singularly careful 
not to exceed the bounds of truth. A map of 
the gold region illustrates the book, and adds to 
its verisimilitude.

Mrs. Atherton's ' Eulers of Kings ' is a mag- 
niloquent romance, the work of a scornfully 
superior person, who this time takes for her 
subject the haute politique of the European 
world. Her hero is the son of the wealthiest 
man in America, and his romance enda with 
the capture of no less a heroine than an Aus- 
trian archduchess, who for the sake of his love 
abdicates her claims to the throne and (pre- 
sumably) staris across the seas to become a plain 
citizen of the American Eepublic. The Emperor 
of Germany is made to figure as the hero's ally, 
and between them they accomplish, or are upon 
the point of accomplishing, the m^astery of the 
world. William is to fall heir to German Aus- 
tria, and, by means of an electrical invention 
of the hero, is to wipe out the governments of 
Eussia and Turkey. The American, for his 
part, has already got the whole of South Amer- 
ica within his grasp, and seems likely to end 
as the autocrat of the entire western continent. 
The unreality of this sort of thing is obvious 
enough, although the writer does show a con- 
siderable familiarity with the political situation 
of to-day in Austria-Hungary, as well as a wide 
acquaintance with the conditions of society in 
Vienna and Pesth. But the best part of the 
book is found in the opening chapters, which 
describe the hero's life up to manhood; for not 
until he reaches that estate does he learn that 
he is the heir to wealth, or that any other task 
lies before him than that of making his own 
unaided way in the world. These early chap- 
ters — of boyhood in the Adirondacks and of 
student-life in a Western university — have a 
marked interest, not to be wholly dulled by the 
turgid and pretentious manner of their telling.

Notes ox N^e^v Novels. 



It is a long time since there has been written 
as good a story of those that go down into the 
sea in ships as Mr. James B. Connelly's 'The 
Seiners ' (Seribner). Like his other prose works, 
it deals with the life, afloat and ashore, of the 
fishermen of Gloucester; and through the text 
.are interspersed sea-songs that leave one long- 
ing for a volume of them. For the first time, 
Mr. Connelly deals with women, just as for the 
•first time he is writing a formal novel; and his 
success in both departures is marked. The nar- 
rative is told by the cousin of one of the three 
quasi-heroines, himself a sailor on a mackerel 
boat. His captain, with more than one human 
failing, but every inch a man, is the hero. The 
girl he loves is rather nebulous in character; and 
the designer of the boat they sail on is wholly 
so, though he too is destined to be married at 
the end. But there are no indistinct outlines in 
the characterization of the woman who makes the 
trouble — the*' other woman' of the story. And 



the accounts of the sailing, the rivalries of the 
crews, the catches of fish, the rescuing of those 
in adversity, the celebrations over victories cul- 
minating in the great race of the best ships, 
make up a rounded and most entertaining whole. 
No reader of the book will ever see a mackerel 
again without increased respect for it and for 
the men who caught it. 

Ambitious in the extreme is the design of 'The 
Flame Gatherers' (Macmillan) of Margaret Hor- 
ton Potter (Mrs. John Donald Black), highly to 
be commended for its plan and almost appalling 
in its scope, and a book, it may be confidently 
predicted, that will be read for many years. For 
the first time in English fiction, the most fasci- 
nating period of the Moslem conquest of Hindu- 
stan is utilized as an historical background for 
the working out of human destinies. The details 
of this transitional and most interesting epoch 
are elaborated with Miss Potter's usual pains- 
taking care, though so thoroughly that the reader 
is conscious chiefly of the novelty of scene and 
place. The real interest lies in the illicit love 
between a captive Moslem prince and the young- 
est and favorite wife of his royal captor. 
Through half of the novel their story works itself 
irresistibly through to its tragic close, the un- 
happy couple dying at last in one another's arms. 
The latter half of the story deals with the child 
who inherits the dual natures of both prince and 
queen. The child of a Brahmin,, he accepts Bud- 
dhism, is driven from the monastery because of 
his double nature, becomes a hermit, and expiates 
at last the sin of his predecessors on the spot of 
its commission. Unusual and tremendous as the 
theme is, it is worked out with full mastery of 
its materials, affording Miss Potter an opportu- 
nity for the setting forth of refined philosophical 
doctrines regarding human nature and human 
destiny. 

For the first time in her writings, Mrs. Edith 
Wharton is successful in depicting masculine hu- 
manity in a manner satisfactory to the possess- 
ors of it, in the short stories published under 
the collective name of 'The Descent of Man, and 
Other Stories' (Seribner). There are nine of 
these tales, worked out with the careful elabora- 
tion and literary finish to be expected of this 
accomplished writer, and exhibiting a versatility 
and resource unusual even in her writings. The 
themes are various: intellectual integrity in the 
face of literary temptation, the reaction upon a 
man and wife of their adoption of a child in an- 
swer to the woman's craving for motherhood, 
what happens to a husband when he discovers 
that his wife has two divorced husbands living 
and their successive impressions upon her plas- 
tic nature, the searchings of heart that the wives 
of 'yellow' journalists have when sufficiently in- 
telligent, over-refinement and subtlety in love- 
making and its effects upon both man and wom- 
an, a concrete example of what 'free' man*iage 
leads to, the sahdng of a literary conscience by 
churchly beneficence, an admirable ghost-story 
with a background of human frailty, and a tale 
of the eighteenth century wherein a youthfully 
self-sufficient son of Salem comes into abrupt 
contact with Latin civilization. All the stories

embody searchings of the human heart; all af- 
ford delightful "" reading to those discerning 
enough to appreciate their true merit. 

'A Texas Matchmaker' (Houghton), by Mr. 
Andy Adams, is a 'human document' rather 
than a work exhibiting literary art, and possess- 
es a certain historical interest in its portrayals 
of Hfe on a Texas cattle-range thirty years ago, 
before the days of fences and railways. The 
ranch-owner, an early settler and veteran of the 
struggle for Texan independence, is the central 
figure of the story and gives the book its name 
through his persistent endeavors to make match- 
es between every maid and bachelor whom he 
views with favor. Accounts of these love affairs, 
none of which run smooth, combined with inter- 
polated tales of frontier life, make up the long 
volume, certain to bring conviction of the auth- 
or's knowledge and sincerity. 

The latest book of Mr. Hamlin Garland, 'The 
Light of the Star' (Harper), is an account of 
the difficulty a young playwright and a still 
younger actress of prominence have in persuad- 
ing managers first, and the play-going public af- 
terward, of the merits of a drama or two not 
designed to split the ears of groundlings. In the 
intercourse made necessary by the acceptance 
and rehearsal of the plays, the two fall in love 
in the most natural manner, and much of the 
plot proceeds according to the demands of the 
conventional romance. Remembering Mr. Gar- 
land's earnest protest against literary abuses of 
one sort and another in his earlier works, it is 
something of a surprise to find here no adverse 
criticisms of the combination of theatrical man- 
agers which has stifled our American drama, and 
this notwithstanding the fact that all the action 
of the story depends upon this lamentable con- 
dition of affairs. The novel is unusually short, 
and not entirely convincing. 

A most appropriate collective title, 'The 
Givers,' graces Mrs. Mary E. Wilkins Freeman's 
book of short stories published by the Harpers. 
Various forms of generosity, rather than conven- 
tional love-making, animate the eight tales that 
make up the volume, and give it both originality 
and force. As before, New England and its peo- 
ple appear in the pages, all of them sufficiently 
idealized to make their exact location, even by 
commonwealths, impossible. The first of the 
stories, which lends its name to the book, is a 
most laudable satire on the too-common practice 
of giving gifts that suit the whim of the giver 
rather than the need of the one to whom they 
are given. The last story, which shares with the 
initial one the palm of merit, tells of a clergy- 
man with whom benevolence has been carried al- 
most to the point of criminality in his earlier 
life, and who later finds few compunctions in 
taking the money of a comfortable fellow-wearer 
of the cloth to relieve the pressing necessities 
of an unfortunate family. The other components 
of the volume are only less well done, and fully 
sustain Mrs. Freeman's reputation as a literary 
artist'. 

An Italian novelist of repute, the late Captain 
Olivieri Sangiacomo, makes his first bow to an 
English-speaking audience in 'The Colonel, a 



Military Romance' (David Nutt), translated by 
Mr. E. Spender. The book has already appeared 
in French, German, and Swedish; and its vogue 
can be explained by its sociological interest, apart 
from the study in heredity involved in its two 
leading characters. A colonel in the Italian 
army, on the road to higher rank, and somewhat 
negligent of regimental affairs in view of greater 
ambitions, is rudely recalled to his duties through 
the shooting of several members of his command 
by a new recruit of lawless tendencies. Inves- 
tigation shows that the young man is the colo- 
nel's own unacknowledged son, and retribution 
swiftly follows. The methods and phases of la- 
bor agitations in Italy occupy a large place in 
the story, with the means taken to suppress them, 
identical with those used by Mr. Cleveland in 
Chicago in 1894 and just now in use in Colorado. 
The book is instructive as well as entertaining, 
and makes one wish for more of Captain Sangia- 
como 's work. 

Had Mrs. Elinor Macartney Lane striven less 
strenuously for corroborative detail to lend an 
air of veracity to 'Nancy Stair' (John Lane), 
her work would be much less open to criticism. 
The narrative concerns chiefly the daughter of a 
noble Scottish house, and includes Robert Bums 
among its characters. Nancy is represented as 
being a poet, and to this end a fac simile of her 
autograph is given, written quite plainly in the 
fashionable hand of the present generation. 
This is a mere detail, however, and does not seri- 
ously affect the real sprightliness of the book, 
which is unusual in both conception and execu- 
tion, the main incident turning upon Nancy's 
self-acquired knowledge of legal procedure and 
the consequent acquittal of her favored lover. 

'The Woman Errant, Being Some Chapters 
from the Wonder Book of Barbara, the Commu- 
ter's Wife' (Macmillan) gives further delightful 
acquaintance with a presumably fair unknown, 
who figures as the heroine of her own narrative, 
though not of the romance therein contained. 
Barbara takes a family of rather remote cousins 
who have been deprived of most of the opportuni- 
ties of life by the indigence and narrowness of 
their clerical father, secures for them the coun- 
tenance of a very rich widow and her fashionable 
friends, and not only gives her favorite among 
them something to live for, but incidentally some 
one to love. The real merit of the work lies in 
its delicious characterizations of women by a 
woman, given with the same zest and joy in the 
telling that have been apparent in the earlier 
volumes from the same hand. The book is 
rather distinctly one for summer reading, though 
it cannot fail to interest if read by a winter's 
fire. 

After six years, a new edition of Mrs. Elia 
W. Peattie's 'The Shape of Fear, and Other 
Ghostly Tales' (Macmillan) has been brought 
out, a circumstance sufficiently remarkable in 
these days of novels dead in their first year to 
be worth noting. The book merits its resurrec- 
tion; but not more so than that other collection 
of short stories from Mrs. Peattie's pen, 'The 
Mountain Woman.' The tales which are called 
ghostly are delicately and sometimes humorously

so, and fill a place not quite occupied by any- 
thing else in English fiction. A recounting of 
their titles should be sufficient inducement to 
anyone who has not read them, to take the little 
volume away on vacation: 'On the Northern 
Ice,' 'Their Dear Little Ghost,' 'The House 
That Was Not,' 'Story of an Obstinate Corpse,' 
'A Child of the Rain,' 'The Room of the Evil 
Thought,' 'Story of the Vanishing Patient,' 
'The Piano Next Door,' 'An Astral Onion,' 
*From the Loom of the Dead,' and 'A Gram- 
matical Ghost.' 

The anonymous work called 'The High Road' 
(Stone) purports to be the autobiography of a 
woman born of humble folk in West Virginia, 
who by dint of sacrificing her individuality, econ- 
omising in the wrong places, toadying to the 
powerful, bullying the weak, writing for yellow 
journals, and doing a number of other things 
equally not worth doing, finally achieves social 
position in New York, having previously acquired 
it abroad. While there is no reason to doubt 
that the means employed will generally bring 
about similar results, the impression gained 
from the book is that the writer is a journalist 
rather than a person of social importance. As 
:a close study of existing society at home and 
abroad, the book presents its most valuable side. 

In 'The Philanthropist' (Lane), Mr. J. F. 
Causton has painted the portrait of a self-seeking 
and inefficient man wedded to an intractable and 
extravagant wife, who pays the penalty of his 
inherent instability of character by sinking with 
his family to the level of a rather common re- 
■cipient of the bounty of others. He has a daugh- 
ter who preserves her self-respect through all 
the family vicissitudes, and is rewarded at last 
with the affection of a rich and worthy man. 
The entire narrative moves within the sphere 
of British Methodism, and insists upon the in- 
herent goodness of the more modest members of 
that communion, even while holding up to ridi- 
cule the words and deeds of the more pretentious. 
The portraiture is particularly good, and the 
book unconventionally but highly moral in its 
conclusions. 

'Jack Barnaby (Dillingham) is a study of 
an unfortunate attachment and its effects upon 
the man and woman participants, as well as on 
the girl with whom the man afterward falls hon- 
estly in love. It is written by Mr. Henry James 
Rogers, its action takes place in New York, and 
it is rather modem in its re-statement of an old 
problem. While not exhibiting marked abilitj', 
it is a work of considerable promise, little more 
than a short story in length and treatment. The 
manner in which the nice girl rescues the man 
from himself at the close is its best touch. 

'Wellesley Stories' (Bacon) is Miss Grace 
Louise Cook's volume of four years ago revised 
and enlarged, and exhibiting occasional little 
graces that were denied it on its first appear- 
ance. A pleasant series of pictures of girls' col- 
lege life, and of the spirit of solidarity Wellesley 
inculcates among her children, is presented with 
a firm hand and fair mastery of literary method. 
The first of the stories, which deal very little 



with love between the sexes, is, curiously enough, 
the least convincing of them all. 

Mrs. L. Parry Truscott has written a simple 
and satisfactory problem study, and ' The Mother 
of Pauline' (Appleton) is the title, taken in part 
from the child's mother, for whom she is named, 
and partly from the elder sister of Pauline, who 
has been the only mother she remembers, and 
who furnishes the romance of the book through 
her own love. Quietly written, the book is in sev- 
eral respects one of more than ordinary merit. 

A story vivacious almost to the point of ec- 
centricity is Miss Valentine Ilawtrey's 'Perro- 
nelle' (Lane). The heroine is a girl of fifteen 
living in Paris at the beginning of the fifteenth 
century; and the story concerns itself with her 
erratic and infelicitous career. There is some- 
thing of the learning of the day interspersed 
in the narrative, much old French, and a great 
deal of conversation. 

Melodrama of an old-fashioned sort is pre- 
sented in 'Lychgate Hall' (Longmans), by 'M. 
E. Francis' (Mrs. Francis Blundell). A haunted 
house, a distressed damsel, a stalwart yeoman, 
a noble turned highwayman, a farmer's daughter 
who chances not to be buxom, and a large beefy 
baronet, control the action of the work, and do 
about what they have been doing in English fic- 
tion for considerably more than a century. The 
narrative is long, a great deal of padding coming 
between the scenes of dering-do. 'Sublimated 
dime-novelism, ' with the scenes laid in Marlbor- 
ough's day, characterizes the book sufficiently. 

After Mr. William Sage's 'Robert Tournay,' 
something better than 'Frenchy, the Story of a 
Gentleman' (Scott-Thaw) was expected from his 
pen. The story is not much more than the sort 
of thing written for messenger-boys and serving- 
maids, with a French nobleman of the least con- 
vincing kind for its hero, and the affairs of the 
universe shifting obligingly to compass the auth- 
or's ends. The illustrations, — quite uninten- 
tionally, — show the hero as the sort of combina- 
tion idiot and knight he seems to have been. 

Mr. Alexander Nelson Hood has incorporated 
the story of the independence of Venice in the 
beautifully printed 'Adria, a Tale of Venice' 
(Dutton). He has seized upon the historical 
episodes in that roinantic and little-known step 
toward the independence of Italy for the dra- 
matic crises of his argument, but has not alto- 
gether succeeded in connecting them vitally with 
his fictional characters. Mingled with these are 
chapters which discuss Venetian painting and 
earlier history, — most informing, but distinct 
breaks in the action. Taken separately, the in- 
gredients of the work are admirable; but they 
have been so little welded together that the 
general effect is amateurish. 

Something of the spirit manifest in Mr. 
George Meredith's essay on Comedy lies behind 
Mr. W. E. Norris's 'Nature's Comedian' (Apple- 
ton), the protagonist of the novel being a young 
man of most susceptible nature who has. made 
a. surprising success as an actor after being 
foredoomed to failure by his conventionally pro- 
vincial but gently-bred family. He falls in love

and out of it with an ease and versatility that 
bespeak his shallowness of character but will 
still aiford the reader considerable amusement. 
The tragic close of the book, wherein the hero 
loses his life as a result of his ill-advised im- 
petuosity, will be felt as a striving after para- 
dox, but there is presented a careful view of 
British contemporaneous life in several of its 
aspects. 

In 'Evelyn Byrd' (Lothrop), Mr. George Gary 
Eggleston completes his trilogy of the Civil War 
as seen from the side of the South, and at the 
same time reaches his high-water mark in fiction. 
Some of the characters in the two earlier works 
reappear in this, though the sTovj is in no sense 
a mere sequel to them. It discusses the events 
preceding the fall of the Confederacy, and in- 
troduces large elements of commerce and finance. 
The heroine is an appealing character, a girl of 
many and varied adventures, throughout which 
she preserves a sweetness and simplicity of char- 
acter seldom found in modem romance. The 
war scenes are well done. 

Fishing has long been the most literary of 
pastimes among English-speaking peoples, and 
though Mr. H. W. Lanier makes no effort to 
connect 'The Romance of Piscator' (Holt) with 
the older traditions of the art, he has made a 
really delightful and humorous tale out of the 
pursuit of a maiden and any number of fish, the 
manner in which each interest gives way to the 
other being told with great gusto and evident 
enjoyment. The fisherman loses himself in the 
lover, and the lover in the fisherman, many a 
time before the end is reached and the hardy 
rival beaten in both contests of skill. It is also 
to be said that when the end comes it is a toss- 
up as to whether the maiden was fishing for the 
piscator or the piscator for the maiden; assured- 
ly none of his mighty catches had any such ele- 
ment of prolonged uncertainty about them. 

Without literary pretension, Mrs Fannie Hardy 
Eekstrom has embodied a variety of human inter- 
ests in her tales of lumber-camps in Maine, col- 
lected in a small volume with the title 'The 
Penobscot Man' (Houghton). Dealing with ele- 
mental forces in the great northern forests, the 
American, whether of white or aboriginal blood, 
acquires something of the character of his sur- 
roundings, and is moved to deeds of heroism, the 
most striking of which are set forth in this book, 
oftentimes in the very language of the actors in 
them. Plain and uninteresting as the daily life 
of a lumberer seems to be, there are emergencies 
arising wherein he proves himself strenuous in 
the better sense of the word, doing brave things 
with a fine unconsciousness wholly denied the 
usual preachers of strenuosity. 

'A Forest Drama' (Coates) is rather a melo- 
drama, in which an escaped English convict runs 
away with a beautiful English girl visiting in 
the wilds of Canada, carries her to his camp far 
in the north, and waits accommodatingly while 
an English and a French-Canadian lover rescue 
her from his toils. The treatment of the wild 
scenes through which the heroine is conducted 
shows familiarity with them, and continued ac- 
tion makes the book interesting. 



Two editors of woman's pages in daily jour- 
nals, one a Philadelphia man and the other a 
Southern woman, carry on the correspondence 
which makes up the story of 'Daphne and Her 
Lad' (Holt). The authors, effectually concealing 
themselves in their characters, are Mr. M. J. 
Lagen and Miss Cally Ryland, and their work 
has much the impress of reality; at least, the 
letters are quite of the sort that youthful jour- 
nalists might write one another in the same cir- 
cumstances. The letters are announced in the 
book as 'not originally intended for publication,' 
but bear marks of close editing and rewriting to 
fit them to the tale, the end of which is evidently 
an after-thought— and not a particularly happy 
one. 

'Crecy' is a little New Jersey Quaker of the 
Revolutionary period, in Miss Edith Lawrence's 
novel of that name (F. M. Buckles & Co), and it 
is supposed to be made up of the letters passing 
between herself and the members of her family 
during the British occupancy of the newly de- 
clared State. In the young lady are mingled 
strains of the North and South, accounting for 
the pleasant mixture of forethought and reck- 
lessness that makes up her character. There is 
an abundance of fighting and love-making, with 
a joyful ending in the interests of international 
amity. 

In 'The Jessica Letters' (Putnam) there will 
be found a most refreshing quality of classicism, 
imparted by a real love for and knowledge of 
the Latin poets, a most graceful learning in- 
corporating itself with a pretty love-story. The 
letters are supposed to pass between the literary 
editor of a New York journal and the daughter 
of a Methodist parson in the South, the acquaint- 
ance beginning with her calling on him in his 
office in regard to work for the journal, and con- 
tinuing, through the excellence of the reviews 
she writes for him, until literary interests are 
merged in the sentimental. The editor has a 
philosophy of his own, based on wide reading of 
classical authorities, and his strictures on mod- 
ern sentimentality will be enjoyed by many who 
find themselves in a minority to-day. The work 
is anonymous, but its author has no reason to 
disown it. 

The conversation of the leisure classes of Eng- 
land has seldom been so exhilaratingly painted as 
by Mr. John Galsworthy in 'The Island Phari- 
sees' (Putnam). With one marked exception, 
the characters are the well bom, well bred, edu- 
cated, cultivated, and Avealthy folk of the moth- 
er country. This exception is a youthful adven- 
turer from the continent, half Dutch and half 
French, who has seen and known the realities 
of life at first-hand. The protagonist of the 
book meets him by chance, and disillusionment 
regarding the ideals of his class follows until 
he is no longer to be ranked with the thinkers 
who are 'safe.' He procures for the foreigner 
a position as tutor in the family with which he 
expects to intermarry; and this proves his un- 
doing. A more direct blow at social complacency 
has seldom been given, and the book should 
make good reading for those whose opinions are 
not prescribed for them by their worldly position.

Early American Readers whose memories reach 
schools and back to the primitive district 

school-books. school, with its hard benches and 
much-whittled desks, will renew their youth in 
Mr. Clifton Johnson's * Old-time Schools and 
School-books ' (Macmillan). An industrious col- 
lector and careful student in this department of 
literature, the author has got together a goodly 
store of curious items, which he generously illus- 
trates with a very attractive display of ancient 
title-pages, rude woodcuts from primers and other 
textbooks, exteriors and interiors of historic 
school-houses, portraits of famous pedagogues, 
and other matters, interspersed with frequent ex- 
tracts from the old readers and spellers that have 
now in many cases become so hard to find and so 
impossible of purchase except by the rich. The 
chapters on early schools are, appropriately 
enough, confined almost exclusively to those of 
New England, whose lead in public-school edu- 
cation is emphasized. New Amsterdam's rival 
claim is shown to rest on slight foundation. An 
incidental reference to Benjamin Harris's * Pub- 
lick Occurrences ' as the earliest American news- 
paper will perhaps surprise those who are wont 
to think of * The News-Letter ' as the pioneer in 
this line. This general false impression, it may 
here be explained as the author has not dwelt on 
the matter, is probably due to the fact that the 
first-named paper was suppressed by the provin- 
cial authorities after the issue of the initial num- 
ber, September 25, 1690, and only one copy of it 
is now known to be extant,— the copy on file at 
the State-Paper Office, London. It was not until 
fourteen years later that postmaster John Camp- 
bell began the issue of his ' News-Letter.' Both 
these papers, it is hardly necessary to add, were 
printed in Boston. 



Japanese Having written on the merits of 

physical training the Japanese system of ' jiu- 
for children. j^^g^ , ^^^ ^^^^ ^^^ women, Mr. 

H. Irving Hancock turns to the coming genera- 
tion and applies the same series of exercises in 
his * Physical Training for Children by Jap- 
anese Methods, a Manual for Use at Home and 
in the Schools ' (Putnam). Of necessity, the 
exercises described in this volume are modified 
to suit a more tender age; but they take the child 
of ten and bring him to an improved condition 
of bodily health and strength quite as thoroughly 
as those set forth in the previous works for men 
and women. As in the former books, little or no 
apparatus is prescribed; but a difference will be 
found in the end sought for. While with the 
elders ' jiu-jitsu ' was the art of hurting with- 
out being hurt, with the youngsters health and 
strength are sought for Avithout regard to the 
uses to which they can be put. The book, like its 
predecessors, is profusely illustrated from photo- 
graphs of both boys and girls actually engaged 
in the amicable contests of which the exercises 
are chiefly composed, which have the advantage 
over ordinary turning, gymnastics, and calisthen- 
ies of the western world in being immediately 



competitive. The amount of space required will 
make the introduction of * jiu-jitsu ' somewhat; 
difficult in schools without gymnasiums; but it 
is well worth trying at home, where its demon- 
strated efficiency should lead to its introduction 
as part of a complete system of education, after 
the manner of the ancient Greeks. 



Men and manners The book by Mrs. Frederick Boas, 
of the England entitled ' In Shakespeare 's Eng- 
of Elizabeth. j^nd ' (James Pott & Co.), is not 

in any specific sense Shakespeariana, but only a 
series of brief biographical and descriptive 
sketches of the men and manners of Elizabethan 
England (James Pott & Co.). The best chapters 
are the more general ones, such as ' Country 
Life ' and * Schools and Universities,' both of 
which contain a large amount of interesting data 
that would be hard to come at elsewhere. Some 
of the biographies, on the other hand, and particu- 
larly those of authors, are commonplace and 
quite unnecessary revisions of material already 
easily available to the young student. It is for 
such apparently that Mrs. Boas writes this vol- 
ume, which begins with a forceful sketch of the 
Queen and broadens its outlook, chapter by chap- 
ter, to include all the many-sided activities of her 
great reign,— the work of statesman, soldier, 
priest, and sailor, and finally of the poet who 
alone among them all has had no successor. The 
style of the work is distinctly popular, and the 
book is without notes, index, or bibliography. 
This last omission is a serious one, since no vol- 
ume of this scope can be more than a beginning 
for historical reading. A few good portraits con- 
stitute the illustrations. 



„ ,.. . The tenth volume of * Our Euro- 

Turkey. pean Neighbours series (Put- 

nam) is devoted to an account of 
' Turkish Life in Town and Country.' The au- 
thor, Mrs. Lucy M. J. Garnett, gives us not only 
much information upon the social life, the gov- 
ernment, the institutions and the customs of the 
Osmanlis, or Mohammedan Turks, but also in- 
teresting chapters upon the Albanian Highland- 
ers, the Macedonian nationalities, the Armenian 
communities, the Hebrew colonies, and the 
Nomads and Brigands that go to make up the 
exceedingly complex life of the Ottoman Empire. 
Readers will have an opportunity to correct some 
of their preconceived notions of the family or- 
ganization in Turkey. For example, although an 
Osmanli may legally marry as many as four 
wives, it is the exception rather than the rule 
for even the wealthy to have more than one wife ; 
and a harem is not, as is generally supposed, a 
number of Avomen and slaves maintaining the 
relation of wife to one man, but the female por- 
tion of a family as legitimately organized as 
those of the western peoples. Nor is it a * de- 
testable prison,' but the most cheerful and com- 
modious portion of an Osmanli 's house, a ' sa- 
cred enclosure ' indeed, as the word harem im- 
plies, in which the women of the family are 
protected from all intrusion, and in which the 
wife and mother is the sole ruler.

The administra- It is rare that a Student's thesis 
Hon of our armies contains material interesting to 
tn the Revolution, ^j^g general reader. An excep- 
tion to the general rule is found in ' Tlie Ad- 
ministration of the American Revolutionary 
Army/ by Mr. Louis Clinton Hatch, which ap- 
pears as one of the Harvard Historical Studies 
(Longmans, Green & Co.). The outline of the 
histoiy of the Revolutionary anny is generally ; 
known, beginning with the appointment of Wash- ' 
ington, continuing through Valley Forge, and end- 
ing at Yorktown. But we have lacked an in- 
tensive study of the subject considered as a 
whole. The privations of the troops is fre- 
quently mentioned, the thesis taking up this mat- i 
ter in detail and showing the causes to lie not ; 
only in a lack of funds to carry on the war, but '< 
in mismanagement and internal jealousy. It must • 
be confessed that the details of the rivalries, the 
mutinies, the strife, the cabals, and the frequent 
mercenary motives manifest, make one feel that 
our fathers were not so perfect as they have | 
often been pictured, or that we have vastly im- 
proved since those days. The Newburg Addresses, 
not commonly accessible, appear as an appendix. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Emerson's ' Letters and Social Aims ' and his 
' Poems ' are the latest volumes in the new ' Cen- 
tenary ' edition of his works, edited by Mr. Edward 
W. Emerson, and published by Messrs. Houghton, 
Miflain & Co. The volume of the poems restores 
the pieces omitted by Emerson himself in 1876, 
but restored in the ' Riverside ' edition of 1883. 
There are also some new poems and fragments, 
including about a score of early pieces. The 
notes of this volume are of great value for eluci- 
dation and historical commentary. 

Messrs. B. P. Button & Co. are the publishers 
of three text-books in French that are deserving 
of particular consideration. ' A Companion to 
French Verse,' by Mr. H. J. Chaytor, is just the 
sort of elementary work that is heeded in high 
schools. It gives as much as is likely to be taught 
effectively, and adds a selection of poems for pur- 
poses of illustration and recitation. An adapta- 
tion of Mgrimee's ' Chronique du R6gne de Charles 
WX., made by Professor Ernest Weekley, is espe- 
cially for the quiz method of teaching, besides offer- 
ing an interesting text. 

The publishers of ' The Educational Review ' 
have had prepared, by Mr. Charles Alexander Nel- 
son, an analytical index to the first twenty-five 
volumes of that periodical, covering the period 
from January, 1891, to May, 1903. The fortunate 
libraries and individuals who possess complete 
sets of the ' Review ' will be grateful for this 
work, which now transforms a row of bound vol- 
umes into a veritable encyclopaedia of education, 
ready for consultation upon almost every imagina- 
ble modern educational problem. Analysis by top- 
ics is the leading feature of this index, and the 
work has been intelligently performed. The work 
is a dictionary catalogue (author and subject), 
extending to upwards of two hundred double-col- 
umned pages. 



NOTE8. 



A treatise on ' Illinois Railway Legislation and 
Commission Control Since 1870,' by Mr. Joseph 
Hinckley Gordon, is published by the University 
of Illinois in the series of ' University Studies.' 

' Beowulf and the Finnesburgh Fragment,' 
translated into English prose by Professor Clar- 
ence Griflin Child, is a recent and welcome addi- 
tion to the ' Riverside Literature Series ' of Messr.s. 
Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 

The American Book Co. publish an ' Elementary 
Algebra,' the work of Professor J. H. Tanner. It 
is a manual which covers the most exacting of 
college entrance requirements, and is thoroughly 
logical in its development. 

Burke's ' Conciliation ' speech, edited by Pro- 
fessor William Macdonald, and George Eliot's 
' Silas Marner,' edited by Professor Wilbur Lucius 
Cross, are recent additions to the ' Gateway Series ' 
of texts published by the American Book Co. 

' The Temple Topographies ' is a new series of 
Dent handbooks, which Messrs. E. P. Button have 
undertaken to publish in this country. ' Strat- 
ford-on-Avon,' by Mr. H. W. Tompkins, is the first 
of these booklets to appear, and is prettily printed 
and illustrated. 

' Longer Elizabethan Poems ' and ' Shorter 
Elizabethan Poems,' each with an introduction by 
Mr. A. H. Bullen, are two new volumes in the 
reissue of Arber's ' English Garner/ now nearly 
complete. Messrs. E. P. Button & Co. are the 
American publishers. ' 

Messrs. Ginn & Co. publish a revised edition of 
the ' Ancient History ' of Professor Philip Van 
Ness Myers. The text has been largely rewritten, 
and the illustrations increased in number and 
interest. It would be difficult to imagine a better 
book for high school instruction than this, or one 
more completely equipped with attractive features 
for the student and helpful apparatus for the 
teacher. 

' Russia, as Seen and Bescribed by Famous 
Writers,' published by Messrs. Bodd, Mead & Co., 
is one of Miss Esther Singleton's attractive com- 
pilations. It is a companion volume to her 
' Japan,' recently issued. We are not sure that 
the writers are all ' famous,' but most of them 
are fairly well known, and some of them speak 
with authority. The book is abundantly illus- 
trated. 

Br. John Louis Haney has performed a task of 
considerable usefulness to students of literary his- 
tory in selecting a volume of ' Early Reviews of 
English Poets,' and publishing them (The Edger- 
ton Press: Philadelphia) with notes and a his- 
torical introduction. The introduction is a valua- 
ble sketch of English periodical literature, bring- 
ing together many facts for which we should 
hardly know where else to look. The brief bibli- 
ography which follows is also useful. The reviews 
selected begin with one of Gray's ' Odes,' and end 
with some of the early criticisms of Browning 
and Tennyson. The notorious eafly attacks on 
Keats, Shelley and Byron naturally find a place 
in this collection. A portrait of Jeffrey provides 
this volume with an appropriate frontispiece.

THE DIAL [July 16, 1904 



The Trail of Lewis and Clark 

Was the pioneer American trail west of the Missoui-i river, and the results of that exploration of 1804-6 
were of tremendous importance to the United States, and they were never more apparent than now. 

A publication relating to the Lewis and Clark expedition, just issued by Q. P. Putnam's Sons, 
New York, stands peculiarly alone. This edition is a two volume, 8vo one, called »* The Trail of 
Lewis and Claris, 1804-1904." The author, Mr. Olin D. Wheeler, is the well known writer of 
the popular Wonderland series of the Northern Pacific Railway, in connection with which he made his 
studies and researches for this work. 

Mr. Wheeler has travelled several thousand miles over the route of Lewis and Clark. He has 
camped out, climbed mountains, followed old Indian trails, and visited remote points made memorable by 
those explorers. Their route across the Bitterroot mountains has been followed, identified, and mapped. 

••The Trail of Lewis and Clarlc" is illustrated in color and half tone from paintings, 
drawings, and maps, by Paxson, DeCamp, and Russell, made under Mr. Wheeler's direction, and from 
photographs taken specially for the purpose. The writer tells his own story, and supplements it with 
pertinent extracts from Lewis and Clark, and a host of other historical and narrative Avriters that connect 
the past with the present. Exact experts and photographic reproductions, in half-tone, from the 
ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPT JOURNALS of Lewis and Clark are given. A chapter is devoted to 
the Louisiana Purchase, another to the preparatory measm-es for the exploration, and another to the 
history of each man of the expedition so far as known, including a discussion of the death of Captain 
lyewis. 

1 1 The Louisiana Purchase Exposition at St. Louis, and the Lewis and Clark Centennial 
to be held at Portland, Oregon, in 1905, make this work peculiarly timely because written from the 
standpoint of actual knowledge of past and present conditions of the old trail and country. 

♦*The Trail of Lewis and Clark" should be found in every public and private library in the 
land, and the general reader will find in reading through its pages of large, clear type that truth is, 
indeed, stranger than fiction. 

The book can be oi'dered through any bookseller or news stand, or direct from the publishers.

MARRIAGE 

AND 

DIVORCE 

There was a time when men stole wives, when they 
bought wives, when they got wives free, and when 
they expected dowries. There was a time when 
women did not marry at all, when one woman mar- 
ried a number of men, when with other women she 
married one man, and when alone she was married 
to a husband. At different periods either, man or 
wife, could terminate the relation ; only one or the 
other could do so ; neither could ; nor could both. 
This evolution of marriage and divorce, under prim-

THE FUTURE OF VERSE. 



An interesting essay on 'The Future of Eng- 
lish Verse ' is contributed by Mr. Henry New- 
bolt to ' The International Quarterly.' As one 
of the most vigorous and agreeable of living 
English verse-makers, Mr. Newbolt is well worth 
listening to, and his optimistic temper leads him 
to conclusions that cannot fail to prove gratify- 
ing to all with whom poetry is a serious con- 
cern, and who believe with Shelley that the 



poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the 
world. 

Mr. Newbolt begins by quoting these remarks 
made in conversation by the late Frederick 
Myers : ' There is no future for English verse ; 
English poetry has come to an end. . . . Blank 
verse is worked out, and the rhymes have 
all been used up. The only one left was heaven 
and Devon, and now that has been taken; there 
are no more new ones.' Since Mr. Newbolt was 
himself the appropriator of the rhyme thus 
whimsically characterized as ' the only one left," 
his attention was naturally arrested by the 
assertion so dogmatically made. It had a per- 
sonal bearing, because, if it was true, Othello's 
occupation was indeed gone. But he dissented 
strongly from the pronouncement, and after- 
wards was constrained to express his own view 
to the contrary in the paper which is now before 
us. That view, as briefly stated by him, is that 
' English verse will at any rate not come to an 
end because there is no possible future before 
it ; on the contrary, it is a mine with more than 
one old seam unexhausted and a number of new 
seams almost unopened, though here and there 
we may detect the shafts and pick-marks of 
past centuries about their approaches.' 

To lead up to his own argument, Mr. New- 
bolt next falls foul of Mr. William Archer, who 
is perhaps unduly conservative in his insistence 
upon an adherence to the old forms and models 
of verse. Mr. Archer is all for the orthodox 
rhythms, and looks askance upon the efforts of 
recent poetry to escape from their trammels. 
He complains that Mr. Stephen Phillips and 
' several other poets of real ability make a prac- 
tice of sMghting or deliberately misplacing 
accent.' Admitting that good blank verse must 
not be too monotonously iambic, he neverthe- 
less insists that 'there must be a limit to per- 
missible departure from the normal and reg- 
ular line.' Having illustrated by ample quota- 
tion these two opposing views, Mr. Newbolt 
makes an epigrammatic summary of the logical 
impasse to which they seem to lead us : * We 
are thus in a doubly hopeless position; those 
who follow Mr. Frederick Myers forMd any 
repetition of the past ; while those who follow 
Mr. William Archer still more strenuously for- 
bid anything except a repetition of the past.' 

Mr. Newbolt's way of extricating poetry from 
this tangle is to welcome the licenses of modern 
poets as legitimate extensions of metrical art, 
and to foresee a constantly increasing divergence 



54 



THE DIAL 



[August 1, 



from the conventional canons of rhythmical 
composition. He holds that ' there is practically 
no known limit to the variety of blank verse/ 
that bad rhymes are sometimes better than good 
ones because of the relief they afford to a 
wearied sense, and that ' the expansion of Eng- 
lish verse must be accomplished by the explora- 
tion and conquest of new metres.' All of these 
views are cleverly supported by skilful argu- 
ments and modern instances; but they seem to 
us to constitute a dangerous body of doctrine. 
Nothing is really gained by showing that the 
great poets have all been guilty upon occasion 
of gross irregularities. The liberties which a 
Milton or a Shelley takes with his material are 
usually (although not always) justified by the 
felicity of the results produced; the average 
minor poet of our day will, however, do well to 
avoid imitating the vagaries of his masters, and 
confine himself to the study of their normal 
manner. 

The attempt to follow the masters also in 
their departures from precedent is apt to have 
disastrous consequences — a fact of which the 
examination of some hundreds of volumes of 
very modem verse has made us painfully aware. 
We find that whenever we venture to point out 
some marked cacophony of diction or some gross 
violation of obvious metrical requirement, we 
promptly hear from the aggrieved bard, and the 
burden of his message is that Shakespeare or 
Coleridge or Tennyson did thus and so. With 
mingled scorn and triumph, the illustrative 
verses are paraded before our chastened gaze, 
and we are presumably crushed by the evidence. 
That we are not crushed in reality is due to the 
fact that two ways of escape lie before us. One 
of them is to retort boldly : ' If so — the less 
Shakespeare [or Coleridge, or Tennyson] he;' 
the other is to examine the case closely, when 
we shall usually discover that there is no real 
resemblance between the passages brought into 
comparison. The technical criticism of new 
poetry would come to an end altogether if it 
were once allowed that the old masters, in their 
every line, offered us impeccable moidels and 
texts of canonical authority. And yet this is 
what the greatest part of Mr. Newbolt's argu- 
ment, and the argument of most other modem 
advocates of vers Hires, reduces to. They begin 
by telling us that we should not bow down to 
authority, and they end by the triumphant cita- 
tion of chapter and verse in support of what- 
ever eccentricity they may at the moment be 
engaged in defending. 

The upshot of Mr. Newbolt's discussion seems 
to be that the hope of poetry is in the develop- 
ment of freer and more flexible verse-forms, 
that a writer should be applauded rather than 
censured for his lapses from regularity. For 
our part, we are inclined to think that such 



encouragement of license is ill-advised, and that 
we shall continue to get far too much of it with- 
out this special provocation. One of the most 
marked vices of current literature, verse and 
prose alike, is a painful straining for effect, a 
determination to be original at whatever cost. 
But the sort of originality thus achieved is 
purely superficial, and does not conceal, for any 
reader of critical discernment, the poverty of 
the underlying thought. The poet who really 
has something to say, and who possesses in any 
measure the divine gift of expression, need feel 
no compunotion about using the old rhymes 
and rhythms in the old accepted way. It is the 
spirit that truly matters, and not the mechanics 
of construction. To hesitate at the employment 
of the measures long since perfected is to be 
daunted by the veriest bugbear imagined by 
timid souls for their own undoing; the old bot- 
tles will do well enough if the wine is but new. 
We are minded at this moment of the young 
American poet who has recently wrought, in the 
orthodox forms and upon one of the most 
timeworn of themes, an imaginative structure 
of fresh and wonderful beauty — a modern 
poem in every essential sense — yet whose 
achievement has been censured by horny-eyed 
critics because it dared to take for its frame- 
work so old a story as the Prometheus myth. 

That poetry is at present suffering a decline 
the world over is probably true, but only the 
observer of little faith can believe that it is 
going into definite bankruptcy. The history of 
literature offers too many instances of renewed 
life following upon decline to give countenance 
to any such doleful vaticination. These cyclic 
changes are inevitable in the course of artistic 
development of whatever sort, and the alterna- 
tion of ebb and flow never fails. In English 
poetry, for example, a single instance should 
suffice to strengthen the faintest of heart. 
When, about sixty years ago, the great poetic 
impulse of the early nineteenth century was 
well-nigh spent, the outlook seemed no brighter 
than is ours to-day ; yet a generation later, Eng- 
lish song was again at full tide, and the age of 
Tennyson and Swinburne had come fairly to 
rival the age of Shelley and Wordsworth. 

We are not, then, greatly concerned about the 
exhaustion of rhymes and rhythmes that so 
depressed Mr. Myers, nor are we of the opinion 
that in the new veins which Mr. Newbolt would 
have us open is the hope of English jwetry. 
New departures there will doubtless be, new 
intricacies of melodious design and subtle new 
harmonies of poetic diction; but they will not 
be forced, they will appear as the natural utter- 
ance of the poets of the new race. And there 
will be such poets, not because of the invention 
of new forms demanding embodiment, but 
because the ever-changing life of the human 



1904.]

soul will make imperative its need of new self- 
expression. And men will come more and more 
to realize, in the words of John Stuart Mill, 
that from the poets alone they may learn what 
are 'the perennial sources of happiness,' and 
they will look back upon Matthew Arnold as the 
truest of prophets when he declared the future 
of poetry to be ' immense.' 



THE LAST HOME OF SHELLEY. 



(Special Correspondence of The Dial.) 

Bay of Lerici, Italy, July 8, 1904. 
Presumably there are many Shelley lovers in 
different parts of the world who will recall this 
eighty-second anniversary of Shelley's death, 
July 8, 1822. But, as far as I can judge, my own 
celebration here on the shores where he made his 
last home, and from which he depaxted on that 
fatal sail from which he was never to return, is 
quite a solitary one. *Ecco! Casa di Shelley!' 
ejaculated the boatman, as we rounded the point 
of San Terenzo, after a two hours' sail with 
favoring winds from Spezia, and our boat danced 
on the waves of the Bay of Lerici — * this divine 
bay,' as Shelley called it. Nor does the adjective 
seem excessive to one who looks upon it; for even 
the Bay of Naples, though larger, is scarcely more 
beautiful. Almost land-locked by rugged castles 
at either end, the waves wash a sandy beach on 
which a few houses are picturesquely grouped, 
with a background of gently-sloping hills covered 
with woods of ilex and walnut. No wonder that 
Shelley loved the spot, and wrote of it in one of 
his last letters, ' My only regret is that the sum- 
mer must ever pass.' 

The house being vacant, and the padrone hav- 
ing an eye to a possible tenant, we had no diffi- 
culty in getting admission. There have been 
changes, of course, in these eighty-two years. The 
location is no longer as solitary, nor are the 
inhabitants of San Terenzo as wild and noisy, nor, 
owing to a modem road, does the house stand 
in the very midst of the waves as described by 
Mrs. Shelley in her account of the life there. But 
the interior is quite the same,— a central room, 
three small bed-rooms leading out of it but with- 
out other entrance, a kitchen dark and gloomy at 
the back of the house and across the stairway 
landing; furniture scant and shabby, and of the 
familiar lodging-house type; looking-glasses and 
fancy clocks galore, but not one comfortable 
chair, nor the vestige of a rug to relieve the 
uneven and dingy stone floor; not so much as a 
closet or wardrobe, or even a hook on which to 
hang a coat or gown. If, outside, one under- 
stands Shelley's love of the place as a poet, 
equally inside one understands Mary Shelley's 
hatred of it as a housekeeper. Ill-constructed, 
unventilated, and without a single modem conve- 
nience even to-day, its only attraction is the 
wide terrace running entirely across the front of 
the house. This commands the whole beautiful 
view of the tideless beach, the blue waters, 



wooded hills, precipitous rocks, the near castles of 
Lerici and San Terenzo, and the distant point of 
Porto Venere. Here, one may truly feel Shelley 
as a 'presence plain in the place,' may fancy him 
walking up and down, adding new stanzas to the 
'Triumph of Life,' or writing some of the lovely 
lyrics so full of local color,— 

' Where music and moonlight and feeling are one/ 
or, 

' I sat and saw the vessels glide 
Over the ocean bright and wide, 
Like splrit-wingfid chariots sent 
O'er some serenest element 
For ministrations strange and far.' 

I have been glad to receive here two interesting 
recent books on Shelley, — the privately-printed 
'Appreciation' by Mr. Thomas B. Slicer, and a 
book printed by the Clarendon Press of Oxford, 
'An Examination of the Shelley Manuscripts of 
the Bodleian Library, 'by Mr. C. D. Locock, B.A. 
Two such books, one a sympathetic considera- 
tion of Shelley as man and poet, the other a tex- 
tual study of a kind almost never accorded to a 
modem poet, are an emphatic testimony of the 
great change that has come over the public atti- 
tude regarding Shelley in these latter days. At 
the time of his death, scarcely fifty people knew 
anything about his poetry. Oxford University, 
which had turned him out and badly treated him 
during his life, made tardy recognition of his 
merits seven years after his death by holding a 
debate between Oxford and Cambridge under- 
graduates as to which was the greater poet, Byron 
or Shelley. To be sure, Byron was declared the 
greater by a majority of fifty-seven, — a decision 
which would probably be reversed now,— but it 
showed at least an appreciation of his genius 
which has been growing year by year ever since. 
Robert Browning's 'Memorabilia,' — 

'Ah, did you once see Shelley plain. 
And did he stop and speak to youT' 

is one of the finest tributes ever paid by one great 
poet to another. Rossetti, Garnett, Forman, and 
Dowden, by notes, biographies, and bibliogra- 
phies, have made such careful and exhaustive 
studies of every scrap of his writing that we are 
now in a position to understand and enjoy Shel- 
ley as well as so peculiar a genius ever can be 
understood. It cannot be said that these two lat- 
est books add anything very essential; yet they 
are both written in the spirit commended by Mr. 
Swinburne thirty years ago in his essay on Shel- 
ley,— 'they help us toward a true text of our 
greatest modern poet.' 

Italy, with good reason, claims Shelley as al- 
most her very own. Here he spent the last four 
years of his life, here his best poetry was writ- 
ten, here he came to his untimely death, and here 
all of his material part that was spared from 
flood and fire lies buried. A monument by 
an Italian sculptor at Via Reggio commemorates 
his memory on the shores he loved so well ; but it 
is in the Bay of Lerici, off the line of tourist travel 
and seldom visited, that one finds oneself in the 
very spot dearest of all to Shelley's heart and 
most congenial to his poetic spirit.

A Follower's View of Whistler.* 



It is a pity, from one point of view at least, 
tliat so much has been written about Mr. James 
McXeill Whistler since his death just a year 
ago. The flood of reminiscence and criticism 
has, to be sure, aroused an interest in Whistler 
the man, and to some extent also in Whistler 
the artist, in quarters where he was hitherto 
quite unknown. But hasty comment and 
garbled anecdotes soon satisfied that interest, 
and by the time the best articles and the first 
books were ready some of us had to confess to 
being a little tired of Mr. Whistler's unparal- 
lelled egotism and * amazing' eccentricity in 
manners and nocturnes. And yet, if the news- 
paper anecdotes and magazine ' appreciations ' 
had a certain charm — that charm which crops 
out in everything that is written, however per- 
functorily, about Mr. Whistler, — so much the 
more are the longer and really adequate disquisi- 
tions that are still appearing calculated to win 
and hold even a waning attention. For Mr. 
Whistler had the distinction, rare in this pleas- 
antly conventional age, of holding with all his 
soul to one supreme conviction ; and if his creed 
involved the assumption that nobody was quite 
so important as Mr. Whistler, it was not unique 
in that respect, but rather in the tenacity with 
which he clung to it, and in the essential and 
wholly delightful absurdities with which he 
emphasized its principal tenets. 

This is possibly a roundabout way of explain- 
ing that, while the expectation aroused by the 
announcement of a new book about Whistler 
may no longer have as keen an edge as could be 
wished, the book itself may safely be counted on 
to create enthusiasm. Particularly is this true 
of the latest addition to Whistler literature, — 
a stout quarto volume with the tdtle ^Whistler 
as I Knew Him,' by Mr. Mortimer Menpes. Its 
distinction among books on the same subject 
lies first in the number and beauty and interest 
of its illustrations, and next in its fresh and 
valuable point of view. Mr. Menpes met 
Whistler while the latter was engaged in print- 
ing his Venetian etchings, instantly recognized 
his genius, and forthwith left the schools at 
Kensington to become his bond-slave, ' follower,' 
and friend. In the characteristdc course of a 
friendship with Whistler, he finally became an 
enemy and an outcast, whose very name the 
Master professed to have forgotten. But he 
bore his exile from the ranks of the ' followers ' 
philosophically; and now, looking back with 

* Whistler as I Knew Him. By Mortimer Menpes.

vivid pleasure to the days of his discipleship, he 
writes of the Master with dignity and respect 
quite untainted by bitterness. In addition to 
his intimate knowledge of the man and the 
artist, Mr. Menpes has another important quali- 
fication for making a book about Whistler. He 
owns a large and representative collection of 
Whistler's etchings and dry-points, and a press 
whose excellent work dates back in some meas- 
ure to his early apprenticeship under Whistler, 
who taught him the art of printing and even 
allowed him the special privilege of printing 
from his own cherished plates. All the etchings 
and dry-points reproduced in the present vol- 
ume, and constituting three-fourths of the hun- 
dred and thirty-four full-page illustrations in 
tint and color, are from proofs owned by Mr. 
Menpes. Among them are several first states, 
unique impressions, and series of variant prints 
from the same plate, which, besides being of 
intrinsic interest, serve to throw light on Whist- 
ler's painstaking methods of work. These are 
also described in detail, but without technical- 
ity, in the chapter entitled 'The Etcher.' 
Besides the hundred etchings, there are about 
thirty illustrations exemplifying every other 
department of Whistler's artistic activity except 
muiial decorating, and several portraits from 
Mr. Menpes's plates or from photographs. All 
the illustrations were printed and engraved at 
Mr. Menpes's own press, under his personal 
supervision. This means that the work is 
exceedingly well done, and has something of 
Whistler's spirit. It is a pity that the relation 
between pictures and context is not closer. 
Some of the less familiar etchings and paintings 
need a word of comment, and some suggestion 
of the basis on which a selection was made 
would not come amiss. But perhaps all this 
would be contrary to the Whistlerian canon 
which declares that pictorilal and literary art 
are utterly divergent in aims and methods; or 
to that other canon which advises the 'plain 
man' to keep clear of matters artistic, since 
he does not and never can understand them. 

However this may be, Mr. Menpes has chosen 
to write not a critique of Whistler's art, nor a 
formal exposition of its principles, but a series 
of familiar essays, each dealing with some phase 
or other of Whistler as Mr. Menpes knew him 
in his prime. The latter is not an artist in two 
mediums, like the author of 'The Gentle 
Art of Making Enemies'; his literary work is 
painstaking but not finished, his sense of humor 
o'f the inexpressive English sort that we Ameri- 
cans should call merely good-natured tolerance 
of other men's foibles. But his genuine admira- 
tion for Whistler gives force to his style and 
vitality to his portraiture, which, considering 
the close relation between the two men, seems 
to be just and well-balanced, though more 



1904.] 



THE DIAL 



57 



superficial in some directions than we have a 
right to expect. 

For example, the worst chapter in the book is 
the introductory one, which is sharp with irrita- 
tion over what Mr. Menpes considers the glib 
exaggerations of many of Whistler's critics, and 
their too enthusiastic attention to his literary 
achievements. Mr. Menpes considers ' The 
Gentle Art' a dangerous document, and per- 
haps it is if one misses its point and unity and 
persists in viewing it as^ so much biographical 
data, by which Whistler and the Enemies are to 
be known to posterity, instead of as a caustic 
and very brilliant satire upon modern aesthetic. 
But perhaps it is too much to expect one of the 
Enemies to understand the impersonal bearings 
of ' The Gentle Art.' 

The lack of penetration shown in the preface 
is offset by a fascinating first chapter, called 
' In the Day's Round,' which describes a typical 
day spen-t in Whistler's company. It began 
invariably with an imperious summons, which 
arrived by the first post, and in obedience to 
which Mr. Menpes hurried to Whistler's house. 
Together the two would proceed to the studio, 
where the first business of the day was the 
reading of "Whistler's invariably exciting mail, 
and the making of elaborate plans for ' scalp- 
ing' the venturesome writers. Then Whistler 
would take his little pochade box, and they 
would stroll off to the Embankment or down a 
side street in Chelsea, and the Master would 
sketch. 

' It might be a fish-shop with eels for sale at 
so much a plate, and a few soiled children in the 
foreground; or perhaps a sweet-stuff shop, and the 
children standing with their faces glued to the 
pane. There we would stay and paint until lunch- 
eon time, sitting on rush-bottomed chairs borrowed 
from the nearest shop. Wherever Whistler went 
he caused interest and excitement: men, women 
and children flocked about him — especially chil- 
dren, Chelsea children, shoals of them. If one 
of them appealed to Whistler from the decorative 
standpoint, he would say, " Not bad, Menpes, eh? " 
This was perhaps a very soiled and grubby little 
person indeed. But Whistler would take her 
kindly by the hand and ask her where she lived; 
and the three of us would trot along to ask the 
mother if she might sit, the child with its 
upturned, flower-like though dirty face, gazing 
with perfect confidence at Whistler. And the Mas- 
ter would talk to her in a charmingly intimate 
way about his work and his aspirations. " Now 
we are going to do great things together," he 
would say; and the dirty-faced child, blinking up 
at him, seemed almost to understand.' 

Then would come the tussle with the mother, 
who naturally wanted to wash her child, and 
finally the three would hurry back to the studio 
for luncheon — cooked by Whistler himself — 
and a long afternoon of work. When the child 



had gone off, tired but happy over the toys that 
it was part of Menpes's duty to provide for her, 
the two friends visited the tailor, — where the 
discussion over the Master's wardrobe 'gener- 
ally ended in a violent attack on the tailor,' — or 
made the round of the galleries, Whistler drop- 
ping an enigmatic ' Ha ! ha ! amazing ! ' here 
and there. Then came dinner at the Arts Club, 
perhaps a visit to the theatre, where Whistler's 
strange antics diverted attention from the stage, 
and afterwards a supper at the Hogarth Club. 
Here Whistler gathered all the men about him 
by the sheer fascination of his talk. Finally 
there was the walk home, — always around by 
the embankment, — 

'To look at some nocturne, perhaps a fish-shop, 
which Whistler was trying to commit to memory. 
He would talk aloud as he created the idea for one 
of his marvellous pictures: " Look at that golden 
Interior with the two spots of light, and that old 
woman with the chequered shawl. See the warm 
purple tone outside going away up to the green of 
the sky, and the shadows from the windows 
thrown on the ground. What an exquisite lace- 
work they form! " He would say all this aloud, 
and I would walk back with him to his studio, and 
talk with him, sometimes, until two o'clock in the 
morning. Then he would say, as I was leaving: 
" Now, Menpes, remember, I want you to be here 
early in the morning. As for me, I am going to 
make my mind a blank until I paint that fish-shop, 
and you must be here early." ' 

And no matter how early he arrived. Whist- 
ler was always ready, alert, sparkling, exquisite, 
indefatigable, — and with thought for nothing 
but his own affairs. No wonder that the Fol- 
lowers, whose youthful enthusiasms furnish 
miaterial for Menpes's most interesting chapter, 
never confided their association, much less their 
individual ambitions, to the Master who inspired 
them. He would have laughed them to scorn, 
and then set them to grinding ink for him. 
Two of the Followers, Menpes and Walter Sick- 
ert, were acknowledged pupils of Whistler, 
though he never set them tasks nor looked at 
their finished work, nor gave them formal 
instruction of any kind. But they felt, and 
no doubt rightly, that his companionship was 
worth more to them than the systematic criti- 
cism of a less gifted teacher. He dropped them 
encouraging words occasionally, and once he 
confided to them the secret of drawing, as it 
luad been revealed to him in Venice. But 
though they seldom dared ask questions, they 
had the freedom of the studio, could, watch 
Whistler at work day after day, study hk 
methods, and feel his influence. Over all the 
Followers this influence was supreme, and they 
carried Whistler's paradoxical creed to more 
paradoxical extremes. 

' Nature, we said, is for the painter a decorative 
patch; a portrait, a blot of color, merely an object 



58 



THE DIAL 



[August 1, 



in relation to a background. . . . For the painter, 
nature should be tilted forward and without dis- 
tance — a Japanese screen, a broad mass of tones 
— a piece of technique. The face in a portrait 
should not be more Important than the back- 
ground. The moment you realized that it was a 
face, the literary art came in. . . . In the end we 
swept away all faces. Features, we felt, were 
unnecessary.' 

When Whistler talked of breadth and sim- 
plicity, the Followers' pictures resembled clean 
sheets of paper. Then they caught the 'grey- 
panel ' craze, and saw Nature, which they had 
previously painted in prismatic tints, in dull 
monotone. Next, in a moment of revolt, they 
dast loose from all Whistler's methods except his 
boldness and originality, and one of them went 
so far as to etch a plate every day at luncheon 
with a four-tined fork, by way of extra bold- 
ness. Menpes made a proof from one of the 
plates, which had been intended for the portrait 
of a celebrated lady artist, and it was found to 
bear more resemblance to a rainy day. But that 
did not disturb the Follower's serenity, nor his 
belief in his own and Whistler's genius. 

Other chapters are equally full of quotable 
bits, but space forbids more than a hasty glance 
at them. It is pleiasant to find that according 
to Mr. Menpes, Whistler did not catch and fry 
his landlady's pet goldfish because he disliked 
their names of Eose and Fanny, but merely told 
the story about another eccentric painter. The 
celebrated quarrel with the Royal Society of 
British Artists has a chapter to itself. WTiist- 
ler's parting shot, uttered when he and his 
following withdrew from the Society, — * I lam 
taking with me the Artists, and I leave the 
British,' — has here a diverting sequel. Mr. 
Menpes met the party at the Hogarth Club, 
and in an aside asked Whistler what he meant 
to do with the artists. ' Lose them, of course,' 
replied Whistler, promptly. 

As has already been suggested, Mr. Menpes's 
treatment of his subject does not go far beyond 
the surface. He plaints a portrait, rather than 
essays a study of Whistler's complex nature. 
His explanation of that complexity is that, 
' instead of being either enigmatical, or, as other 
critics have decided, a dual personality. Whistler 
was absolutely artistic in every relation of life. 
This motive explains for Mr. Menpes his seem- 
ing vanity, his eccentricity in dress and conduct, 
his delight in stinging repartee and correspond- 
ence, — in epigrams exploited for the epigrams' 
sake. But making all possible allowance for the 
artistic temperament, and granting that the 
real Whistler was the * gentle, sweet, sympa- 
thetic,' thoroughly lovable personality, who 
revealed himself rarely to his intimates, even 
Mr. Menpes must admit that there is still an 



unexplained margin of combativeness, a cloak 
of seemingly impenetrable egotism, which effect- 
ually hid this real man from the rest of the 
world. Mr. Menpes speaks of it occasionally, 
then drops it without explanation, and reverts 
to his original thesis. He tells us, then, nothing 
new about the depths of Whistler's nature, but 
gives us a delightful account of his habits and 
manners. ' Whistler As I Knew Him ' is pro- 
fusely and beautifully illustrated, but it is not 
a picture-book in the sense which implies that 
it is nothing but a picture-book.

A History of Human Marriage.* 



The oldest of all existing institutions is the 
family. In some form or other, the union of 
father and mother and child must have existed 
from the earliest dawn of human life. The 
study of the marriage relation, therefore, car- 
ries us back to a past that is ancient beyond 
all reckoning. Much has been written on this 
subject, though students have usually limited 
their researches to some particular phase of 
the question or to some particular period of its 
development. But a work has lately appeared 
that in a measure deals with the whole his- 
tory of this institution, and carries the dis- 
cussion down to the immediate present. It is 
true, the author's purpose is to trace the history 
of marriage in the three homes of the Anglo- 
Saxon race only; but to accomplish this he has 
been compelled to make investigations and to 
include data which throw a flood of light on 
the institution elsewhere. 

The author. Professor George Elliott How- 
ard, is at present professorial lecturer in the 
University of Chicago. His work comprises 
three solid volumes of about five hundred pages 
each, the result of 3'ears of continuous labor. 
The general reader will peruse the text with 
sustained interest; he will experience little dif- 
ficulty in following the author's argument or 
in appreciating the force and significance of his 
conclusions. The scholar will find in the 
numerous foot-notes, the extensive bibliography, 
and the carefully executed index, many addi- 
tional points of excellence. 

What first impresses the reader is the vast- 
ness of the field which the author has aimed to 
cover, the wide reading and the extensive 
research that the task has demanded, and the 
mass of materials that have to be studied and 
criticized. But on closer examination one is

still more impressed with the masterly manner 
in which this variety of materials is handled. 
In studying a question such as this, it is diflB- 
cult to get entirely away from the view-point 
of our social surroundings. In this respect Pro- 
fessor Howard has succeeded admirably; his 
treatment is purely scientific. He has studied 
marriage, not as an institution established by 
religious authority, but as one that happens to 
exist among men. 

The author begins his work with a study of 
the primitive family. The doctrine that it 
originated in a patriarchal aggregation is soon 
disposed of. More attention is given to the 
theory that in the beginning the mother was 
the centre and ruler of the family; but this 
is also rejected. The author takes his stand 
with those who hold to the theory of original 
pairing. Far back in time, then, there was 
*the free choice of the man, the free consent 
of the woman.' This conclusion, however, 
gives rise to a multitude of problems, to some 
of which the author seems to provide quite sat- 
isfactory solutions; but some remain and per- 
haps always will remain unsolved, as they take 
us back into times and conditions of men that 
were not productive of records. 

As culture advanced, however, and the idea 
of property arose, the status of woman was 
appreciably lowered. She became a thing of 
value which was often stolen and sometimes 
bought. It is wife-purchase that Professor 
Howard finds in the earliest English source. 
But by a gradual development during the first 
six centuries of Anglo-Saxon history, wife- 
purchase gives place to self-betrothal and self- 
marriage. When the twelfth century closes, we 
have in England a marriage that is essentially 
a contract merely. It is not ecclesiastical, for 
the church does not officiate ; it is not civil, for 
the state does not intervene ; it is wholly private. 

And yet, all through the middle ages forces 
were operating that tended to make marriage 
an affair of the church. How the priest first 
began to participate in the nuptial ceremony 
by benedictions, bride-masses, and other litur- 
gical acts, is told clearly and fully. By the 
thirteenth century the development is com- 
pleted. Marriage is now held to be a sacra- 
ment; a priest officiates, and the church con- 
trols. A great system of matrimonial law is 
being perfected by the ecclesiastical jurists: 
not only does the church solemnize nuptials, it 
also presumes to say who may and who may 
not enter into marriage and under what cir- 
cumstances the bond may be dissolved. 

Students who are in the habit of viewing 
the problems of marriage and divorce from a 
theological standpoint will find much food for 
reflection in the author's presentation of the 



attitude assumed by the mediaeval church 
toward these problems. Also interesting is his 
review of the matrimonial theories held by the 
Protestant reformers. But he does not find that 
the ideas of the sixteenth century affected the 
institution in England to any appreciable 
extent before the nineteenth century. In the 
eyes of the law, English marriage is at present 
what it was in the beginning, ' a simple con- 
trlact; but the state has succeeded in imposing 
upon it the condition of publicity — a task 
which the church first attempted but failed 
to accomplish.' 

It will no doubt surprise many of Professor 
Howard's readers to learn that ecclesiastical 
marriages in England are as recent as the 
thirteenth century. Perhaps it may also sur- 
prise them to learn that among the New Eng- 
land Puritans marriage was wholly a civil 
institution at which a magistrate must and a 
clergyman must not officiate. The author also 
finds that while in theory the Southern colo- 
nists looked on marriage and separation as 
within the jurisdiction of the church, in prac- 
tice they frequently permitted the local magis- 
trates to exercise authority in these matters, as 
priests and ecclesiastical courts were generally 
wanting. 

Matrimonial legislation in the United States 
since the Revolution is treated briefly and yet 
quite exhaustively. Statutes and court-deci- 
sions in great numbers have been examined and 
compared, and an extensive analysis is pre- 
sented which gives a full view of the practice in 
the different states with their similarities, differ- 
ences, anomalies and peculiarities, such as is 
probably found in no other work. 

The value of Professor Howard's work lies 
not only in his excellent presentation of a large 
subject, in his sane criticism of earlier writers, 
or in his collection of data for the sociologist 
and the practical reformer ; he has added a clos- 
ing chapter in which he discusses the present- 
day problems that grow out of the family rela- 
tion, and makes numerous suggestions looking 
toward their solution. The chief of these is 
divorce. As there is a necessary connection 
between marriage and separation, their histories 
are told in parallel chapters. The author finda 
that in ancient times divorce was easily secured, 
especially by the husband. In general, disso- 
lution of marriage was looked on as a wholly 
private matter over which the State exercised 
little or no control. Even after Christianity 
had become dominant in Southern Europe, and 
a new theory of marriage had begun to prevail, 
the authorities permitted divorces much as of 
old. During the middle ages, divorces became 
practically unknown; the theory came to be 
held that la valid marriage could not be dis-

solved, but the church had multiplied the con- 
ditions necessary to such a union, and any one 
who tired of a spouse could readily find some 
reason why his marriage should be annulled. 

In the modern practice the author finds much 
to commend and much to condemn. Though 
his attitude toward the question is a liberal 
one, he deplores the frequency of dissolved 
unions. But, as he views it, divorce is not 
necessarily an evil, it is simply the cure for bad 
marriages. This discussion shows that Profes- 
sor Howard's studies have not bereft him of a 
healthy idealism. In vigorous English he pleads 
for higher matrimonial ideals as tiie remedy for 
the much-discussed divorce evil. The solution 
.of the problem he believes lies not so much in 
legislation as in education. ' If there is to be 
salvation it must come though the vitalizing 
regenerative power of a more efficient moral, 
physical and social training of the young/ 
And yet, the legislator can do much by pro- 
viding the proper ' legal environment.' Uni- 
form marriage and divorce laws, more general 
publicity, more dignity in the civil ceremony, 
are some of the reforms that he urges. As 
marriage is a civil institution, Professor How- 
ard believes that all marriages should be 
solemnized by a magistrate; should the parties 
desire it, a clergyman might be asked to officiate 
later. But realizing the practical difficulties 
that such a proposal would encounter, the 
author suggests instead that a registrar be 
appointed for each locality, whose duty it should 
be to license and register all marriages solem- 
nized within his district, to solemnize marriages 
when a civil ceremony is desired, and to witness 
all nuptial ceremonies performed by a clergy- 
man. He also favors certain legal restrictions 
which want of space does not permit us to dis- 
cuss. 

As to the future of the famih'. Professor 
Howard is seemingly very optimistic. The 
situation is not so bad as we are led to imagine ; 
there is no cause for despair. But aft^r one has 
followed the story as the author tells it, one 
can hardly repress the question, Is this opti- 
mism justified? Surely it is more difficult to 
enter into the matrimonial state to-day than 
in centuries past; yet it would seem from the 
author's own statistics that the practice of 
divorce grows continually at an alarming rate. 
Xot until the sociologist shall have traced the 
history of a sufficient number of divorced fam- 
ilies back to the period of betrothal, shall we 
know to what extent divorces can be attributed 
to bad or thoughtless marriages. Meanwhile 
Professor Howard's work will be read and 
studied with increasing appreciation, not only 
by the lover of history but also by the devotee 
of social reform.

Fresh Shakespearian Studies.* 

The publication of a new book on Shakespeare 
should be made a matter of conscience. Only 
the most urgent sense of something new and 
important to say can justify a writer in adding 
even a single item to Shakespearian bibli- 
ography. Such justification Mr. Churton Col- 
lins unquestionably has. Each essay in his 
' Studies in Shakespeare ' is intended to illus- 
trate an important, and usually a neglected, 
principle of Shakespearian criticism. The first 
is an exhaustive presentation of the author's 
favorite contention that English literature can- 
not be intelligently studied without reference 
to the classics; the second is a protest against 
the recklessness of destructive criticism; the 
third, an exposition of the supreme place of 
poetry in modern life, in accordance with Ar- 
nold's well-known view in the essay on ' The 
Study of Poetry ' ; the sixth illustrates Shakes- 
peare's method of dealing with his 'sources'; 
the ninth gives the coup de grace to the ' mon- 
strous myth' of Baconianism. The very Pre- 
face is evidence of the scholarly method and 
enormous resources that all of Mr. Collins's 
other work has taught us to expect. It is proof, 
too, of his daring. Though crushed by ' the 
weight of the superincumbent hour,' one's spirit 
merrily rises at the challenge to German aca- 
demic monographs. We too are ' insular enough 
to think that, on the question of the authentici- 
ty of an Elizabethan drama, an English schol- 
ar can dispense with German lights.' Suffici- 
ently courageous also is his assurance that not 
only ' Titus Andronicus,' the three parts of 
' Henry VI.' and the whole of ' Henry VIII.' 
are the work of Shakespeare, but also the ' Con- 
tention' and the 'True Tragedy.' It is quite 
possible that in his reaction against the destruc- 
tive criticism of the day, he leans slightly to 
the side of excessive conservatism; but that, 
we think, is S'irtue's side.' It requires, more- 
over, courage and a certain self-mortification 
for a reputable critic, at this time of day, to 
discuss Baconianism at all. This 'grotesque 
heresy' belongs to a class to which we may 
apply St. Paul's words, ' Let it not be once 
named among you.' 

But Mr. Collins has other qualifications 
besides scholarship and courage. He takes criti- 
cism very seriously. ' On its competence and 
sincerity,' he writes, 'depends more than can 
be defined or estimated, for it gives the ply to 
the serious study of literature generally. 
Whether that study is to be facilitated or 
retarded, to go straight or to take wrong turns, 
to be fruitful or barren, — for all this it is 
responsible.' A very different attitude is this

from the ctlleUante search for novelties, the 
paradoxical smartness, of the critical writing 
with which we are too familiar. We may as 
well confess that we find it difficult to be judi- 
cial in dealing with a critic who is at the same 
time a scholar of rare excellence, who has a 
keen sense of the social responsibility of criti- 
cism, and who writes at times a style as trench- 
ant and distinctive as Matthew Arnold's. Time 
fails us to enumerate his excellences. He would 
be distinguished as a phrase-maker if he had 
no other critical talents. Fervent as his admira- 
tion of Shakespeare is, there is not a line in the 
book that suggests hysteria. Ardently as he 
maintains his various theses, nothing is more 
evident than that with all the candor and bal- 
anced judgment at his command he is not try- 
ing to make out a case but to arrive at the 
truth. He opens the essay on ' Shakespearian 
Paradoxes' with the remark, * Sainte-Beuve 
has finely said that the first aim of criticism 
should be the discovery of truth ; ' and to this 
volume the remark is eminently applicable. He 
of course makes much use of the citation of par- 
allel passages, but with few exceptions he cites 
genuine parallels. When one perceives the use 
made of this device by the Baconians, one is 
inclined to distrust all parallelism. Nor arc 
they the only offenders; for they can hardly 
outdo in audacity and fatuity some orthodox 
Shakespearians. Mr, Collins is for the most 
part, in this particular as in others, a model of 
good sense. Commenting on the difficulty of 
deciding between mere similarity of thought 
and actual borrowing, he says : ' Common 
sense and the ordinary laws of probability are 
perhaps as good criteria as we can have in these 
cases.' They are, as everyone knows, the last 
criteria usually employed. Moreover, the critic 
who undertakes to prove Shakespeare's indebt- 
edness to another writer because of similarity 
of thought or expression is too often not scholar 
enough to know that his conclusion is nullified 
by quite as significant resemblances to someone 
from whom he could not possibly have bor- 
rowed. Mr. Collins's resources for dealing with 
such a situation are ample, as the essay on 
* Montaigne and Shakespeare ' shows. 

The first essay, ' ShaJcespeare as a Classical 
Scholar,' is the most notable. It undertakes 
to prove, by an exhaustive array of parallels, 
that Shakespeare's 'small Latin' was sufficient 
to enable him to read Ovid, Plautus, Seneca, 
Horace, Juvenal, Persius, Lucretius, and 
Cicero, in the original; and Plato, the Anthol- 
ogy, and the Greek dramatists in Latin transla- 
tions. Ben Jonson's criticism is therefore 
only the classical expert's depreciation of a 
scholarship that would enable the poet merely 
to read Latin with facility, but not to compose 
in it nor to deal with it critically. Mr. Col- 



lins also supposes Shakespeare to have had 
Greek enough to give a perceptible color to his 
style. Since Farmer's famous essay of 1766, 
reprinted recently in Mr. Nichol Smith's 
' Eighteenth Century Essays on Shakespeare,' so 
extensive a claim for the poet has been practi- 
cally unheard of in Shakespearian criticism; 
but we believe that a candid examination of 
Mr. Collins's arguments will show that he has 
substantiated it. To be sure, not all his par- 
allel passages compel assent. 'x\daptation ' is 
rather a strong word for the relation of Temp., 
1.3.399-401 to Lucretius, 2.1002-1006; the 
' undoubted reminiscences ' of Lucretius, 2.20- 
39, that ''permeate' the soliloquies of Henry 
V. and Henry VI. (Hen. V., 4.1; 3 Hen. VI., 
2.5) seem to us highly doubtful. The really 
distinctive note of Lucretius is quite wanting, 
and the soliloquies merely sound the pastoral 
note to be heard in well-nigh every Elizabethan 
anthology. In Troil. and Cress., 5.3, where 
Andromache, Cassandra and Priam attempt to 
dissuade Hector from battle, it is by no means 
necessary to see a reminiscence of the ' Seven 
against Thebes,' for the ultimate source of the 
scene is evidently the ' Roman de Troie ' of 
Benoit de Sainte-More, 11.15113-15525 (Joly's 
edition), where Hector's father, mother, wife, 
and sisters (Helen and Polyxena) plead with 
him in vain. Nor is it quite clear that Hhis 
muddy vesture of decay' (Merch. of Ven., 
5.1.64) owes anything to the a-apKoSTrepi 
fioXaui of 'Hercules Mad,' 1269. Neverthe- 
less, the result of a detailed inspection of the 
essay is conviction of its truth and of its high 
importance. It will not only prove of indis- 
pensable value to readers of Shakespeare, but it 
ought to be a very mine of illustration for stu- 
dents of the classics. 

If this essay is the most instructive in the 
volume, the one devoted to ' The Bacon- 
Shakespeare Mania' is naturally the most 
entertaining. It is a review of ' The Mystery 
of William. Shakespeare,' by Judge Webb, 
Regius Professor of Laws and Public Orator in 
the University of Dublin,- — such a review as 
ought to close the controversy if Baconians were 
amenable to argument or had a sense of humor. 
As Judge Webb is clearly the fine flower of 
Baconianism, we may estimate the whole school 
at its best in him. As we read his divagations 
on the ' noted weed ' of the seventy-sixth Sonnet 
(p. 354), for example, we heartily agree with 
his reviewer in wondering ' whether such prem- 
ises and such reasonings were ever before heard 
out of establishments which it would be dis- 
respectful to specify.' Verily, as Mr. Collins 
says, ' in dealing with Baconians, the first requi- 
site is resignation.' Anyone, whether inter- 
ested in the controversy or not, who wishes to 
read a specimen of acute reasoning, based on 



62

wide and exact learning, and brightened at 
every turn by the sliest of witty suggestions, 
never ill-natured nor heavy-handed, always 
light, graceful, delightful, we should think, 
even to their victim, will do well to read this 
essay. It is a triumphant vindication of Lord 
Shaftesbury's criterion of ridicule as the test 
of solemn absurdities. 

In the essay on ' Sophocles and Shakespeare/ 
Mr. Collins is at his philosophic best. It is a 
parallel of too rare a Mnd, a kind that demands 
at once more exact and more generous scholar- 
ship, and that in more than one field, than any 
but the exceptional critic can command. It is 
a study on large lines of the two great dram- 
atists of the world, an attempt to show how 
essentially alike in spirit, and even in life, they 
were. There could scarcely be a more moving 
plea for the comparative study of English and 
the classics than this admirable paper. Mr. 
Collins is, of course, not equally convincing on 
all points. There is, we think, an occasional 
overstatement, as, for instance, on p. 137, where 
we are told that ' it may be doubted whether a 
sarcasm or acrimonious word ever fell from 
the lips of either ! ' We venture to think that 
he minimizes the place of Necessity in the 
' Antigone.' It is at least a question whether 
Sophocles did not intend to propound an un- 
solved and insoluble enigma. No doubt, one 
ought to obey God rather than men, but then 
the tragic d/mprux becomes a holy and necessary 
crime, necessary because holy, and the tragic 
issue is unavoidable by a God-fearing soul. 
'Antigone falls a victim to a suicidal act of 
audacious disobedience' is hardly an adequate 
account of one of the great problem-plays of 
the world. In this essay, too, he commits him- 
self to an odd ethical position. ' As we note in 
them both as men and artists,' he writes on p. 
141, 'no deficiency, so we discern in them no 
excess; all is balance, all is measure.' Yet both 
indulged 'fully and equally in the pleasures 
sought by the voluptuary and the pleasures 
which appeal to the finer senses and the mind.' 
Again, on p. 136 : 'In youth and middle age 
both were voluptuaries . . . and by no 
poets has the terrible and degrading tyranny of 
mere passion been so intimately and appallingly 
described.' If we concede that the sonnets and 
plays are in any sense autobiographical, as we 
probably must, then Sonnet CXXIX. is doubt- 
less as autobiographical as any; and if so, are 
' no excess,' ' balance,' ' measure,' quite the 
terms to apply to the life of the man who wrote 
it? 

The other studies, each in its way admirable, 
are on the following subjects : ' Shakespearian 
Paradoxes,' an attempt to restore ' Titus 
Andronicus ' to the canon ; ' Shakespeare as a 
Prose Writer ; ' ' Was Shakespeare a Lawyer ? ' 



— containing an amazing list of the legal refer- 
ences in the plays and poems ; ' Shakespeare 
and Holinshed,' a study of the poef s use of 
historical material in Macbeth ; ' Shakespeare 
and Montaigne ; ' ' The Text and Prosody of 
Shakespeare,' a plea for textual conservatism, 
illustrated, like all the rest, by an immense 
array of citations. 

One defect the volume certainly has. For a 
scholar, Mr. Collins's method of referring to 
the plays is most unscholarly. He is inconsist- 
ent in abbreviation; he rarely gives an exact 
line-reference, but alludes vaguely to a speech 
or passage; when he does give a line-reference, 
it is frequently wrong; and, worst of all, he 
misquotes passages that the vulgar also mis- 
quote. ' We are such stuff as dreams are made 
of occurs twice (pp. 52 and 83); Hamlefs 
'when honor's at the stake' (4.4.56) is slightly 
but irritatingly mangled on p. 285; and Mac- 
beth's ' assurance ' becomes ' doubly sure ' on 
p. 212. In the last instance, the reference 
should be to Macb., 4.1 instead of 4.2. On p. 
282, Meas. for Meas., 1.2 should be 1.1.30 ; on 
p. 303, there is both ambiguity and error, for 
the reference, 'in the same play, etc.,' is to 
Temp., 5.1.58 ; on p. 30, the reference to Cym- 
beline should be 3.3.77-78 ; etc. Some of these 
errors are, no doubt, due to the proof-reading, 
which is inexcusably bad. On p. 191, 2 Henry 
IV. should be 2 Henry VI ; on p. 246, ' impor- 
tant' should evidently be unimportant; on p. 
178, 'change and change' should be 'chance 
and change ; ' on p. 254, Banquo should be pos- 
sessive; on p. 154, ' Seward' should be Siward; 
on p. 161, ' Cleon ' occurs twice for Creon. The 
punctuation is highly eccentric, and the index 
is not complete. 

These inadvertencies are perhaps the more 
disconcerting because of the character of the 
book. One could wish it to be faultless; for 
it is the most vivid reminder of the greatness of 
Shakespeare that we have read in many a day, 
an'd it will send its readers to the plays them- 
selves, — which, we suppose, is the end of criti- 
'^ism. Charles H. A. Wager. 



Plats, Acting, and Music* 

Mr. Symons's book may fairly be termed a 
notable volume of criticism ; a fact all the more 
striking since the book is made up of articles 
reporting current amusement, contributed in the 
regular journalistic way to London papers, 
especially to 'The Academy.' One is ready 
enough to credit this sort of writing with read- 
ableness, and far too ready to avoid highly laud- 
atory terms regarding a critic so avowedly

individual as Mr. Symons. But in this book 
Mr. Symons turns out to have a sound percep- 
tion of beauty and its values, and wins his way 
doubtless all the better because his readers may 
have been sceptical at the outset. He has the 
air of rejecting all academic criticism ; of utter- 
ing his casual impressions as if they were valid 
because his and because casual; of being of the 
mood given vogue by Verlaine; of seeming, 
in short, a modern of the type we too defiantly 
call decadent. The habit of mind thus indi- 
cated is often mere pose ; it is not — essentially, 
at least — pose in Mr. Symons. Xor does the 
impressionistic air serve here, as such seeming 
so frequently does, to cloak either wildness or 
dulness of critical imaginings. One repeats that 
Mr. Sy mouses opinions are sound, and even (in 
the good sense of a word doubtless distasteful to 
the impressionist) academic. For instance, in 
dealing with Duse, Bernhardt, Kejane, he does 
not find it necessary to fly in the face of popular 
approval, or even to urge that these astonishing 
acta'esses are liked for qualities they do not 
possess, and that their true virtues are hidden to 
the vulgar. In the main, he likes the qualities 
that are also perceptible to the man of average 
refinement, who could not, however, express 
himself so keenly or so finally. In other words, 
the glowing phrases are animated by common 
sense. But this is not to indicate that the sub- 
stance of these criticisms is commonplace, plus 
the charm of style; Mr. Symons has a fine per- 
ception of delicate things, an honest sense of 
proportion, and, as the mass of his criticism 
will show, he has real vision. 

The title of the book indicates the three 
groups into which the criticism falls, music 
receiving the briefest although perhaps the most 
inter^ting treatment. It is the continental 
stage, — plays and actors, — rather than the 
English, which most concerns Mr. Symons ; and 
not unnaturally, for few would care to doubt 
the current English inferiority in this regard, 
and it is characteristic of this critic to prefer to 
talk of the best things. Not that he scorns the 
Bnglish-spealcing stage, as it is our wholly 
uncritical fashion to do, but that he can dis- 
criminate between good and better, as witness 
this searching comment: 

' Irving represents the old school of acting, just 
as Duse represents the new school. To Duse, act- 
ing is a thing almost wholly apart from action; 
she thinks on the stage, scarcely moves there; 
when she feels emotion, it is her chief care not to 
express it with emphasis, but to press it down 
Into her soul, until only the pained reflection of 
it glimmers out of her eyes and trembles in the 
hollows of her cheeks. To Irving, on the contrary, 
acting is all that the word literally means; it is 
an art of sharp, detached, yet always delicate, 
movements; he crosses the stage with intention, 
as he intentionally adopts a fine, crabbed, personal, 



highly conventional elocution of his own; he is an 
actor, and he acts, keeping nature, or the too close 
resemblance of nature, carefully out of his com- 
position. With Miss Terry there is only the per- 
sonal charm of a very natural nature, which has 
become deliciously sophisticated. She is the eter- 
nal girl, and she can never grow old; one mfght 
say, she can never grow up. She learns her part, 
taking it quite artificially, as a part to be learnt; 
and then, at her frequent moments of forgetful- 
ness, charms us into delight, though never into 
conviction, by a gay abandonment to the self of 
a passing moment.' 

One may agree or differ, but in either event 
will doubtless think that this is carefully-writ- 
ten, carefully-composed criticism, and that it 
has behind it keen observation and high ideals 
of art. Genuine insight is constantly apparent 
in the volume, and perhaps nowhere more 
clearly (in the comments on the theatre) than 
in the discussions of Bemhardt's Phedre and of 
Eejane's Zaza, — not brought together in the 
book, but worth while setting side by side here : 

' R^jane can be vulgar, as nature is vulgar: she 
has all the instinct of the human animal, of the 
animal woman, whom man will never quite civil- 
ise. . . . More than any other actress she is 
the human animal without disguise or evasion; 
with all the instincts, all the natural cries and 
movements. . . . Scepticism is no longer possible: 
the thing is before you, abominably real, a dis- 
quieting and irrefutable thing, which speaks with 
its own voice, as it has never spoken on the stage 
through any other actress.' 

' The passion of Phfidre ... is an abnormal, 
an insane thing, and that passion comes to 
us with all its force and all its perversity; but 
the words in which it is expressed are never extrav- 
agant, they are always clear, simple, temperate, 
perfectly precise and explicit. The art is an art 
exquisitely balanced between the conventional and 
the realistic, and the art of Sarah Bernhardt, when 
she plays the part, is balanced with the same 
unerring skill. She seems to abandon herself 
wholly, at times, to her "fureurs"; she tears the 
words with her teeth, and spits them out of her 
mouth, like a wild beast ravening upon prey; but 
there is always dignity, restraint, a certain remote- 
ness of soul, and there is always the verse, and her 
miraculous rendering of the verse, to keep Racine 
in the right atmosphere. Of what we call acting 
there is little, little change in the expression of 
the face. The part is a part for the voice, and it 
is only in " Phfidre " that one can bear that orches- 
tra, her voice, in all its variety of beauty.' 

Mr. Symons's comments on music are dis- 
tinctly worth quoting. Their suggestiveness is 
of the better sort, that which shows the relation- 
ship of a new work to fundamental criteria ; not 
the poorer suggestiveness which finds its outlet 
in undeliberated epigram or sensational com- 
parison. This, of Tschaikowsky, for example, 
is worth thinking about : ' In your delight at 
finding anyone so alive, you are inclined to wel-

come him without reserve, and to forget that a 
man of genius is not necessarily a great artist, 
and iiiat, if he is not a great artist, he is not 
a satisfactory man of genius.' Mr. Symons's 
_ notion that Pachmann is the greatest living 
piai;ii,st may not find w^ide acceptance, but it is 
based upon the conviction that such praise is 
deserved by one who ' can play certain things 
better than any other pianist can play anything.' 
The ' certain things ' are Chopin's, of course, 
and Pachman's playing 'gives you pure music, 
not states of soul or of temperament, not inter- 
pretations, but echoes. * * * I do not think 
he has ever put an intention into Chopin. 
^Chopin had no intentions.' Mr. Symons's 
deiiunciation of a hybrid art-form, the mingling 
of music and spoken words, may possibly find 
some response now that we are by way of hear- 
ing that 'would-be artistic creation,' Strauss's 
setting of Enoch Arden. There can be but little 
doubt • of the utter correctness of the critic's 
position. 

Enough has been quoted to indicate the qual- 
ity of Mr. Symons's criticism, its independence 
and usual sanity. Its fluency is the fluency of 
ideas rather than of words. If occasionally one 
hesitates in agreement, it is from the feeling 
that now and then the auithor resents the inevit- 
ableness of logic when it is opposed to the 
tempting thrill of momentary impression.

Religious Freedom.* 



About 273 years ago, John Cotton and others 
established in Boston a series of lectures, 
delivered every Thursday, in which matters 
relating to the spiritual and physical well-being 
of the community were discussed. These came 
to be known as the ' Great and Thursday Lec- 
tures,' and have been given almost without a 
break down to the present day. Last year, with 
the cooperation of the American Unitarian 
Association, there was delivered a series of 
lectures on religious liberty in America as 
illustrated by the lives of those who did most 
to further the cause. These lectures have now 
been gathered together, and issued in the form 
of a book. It is worth while to enumerate the 
headings of the chapters, in order to show who 
the * pioneers ' were and what they were thought 
to especially stand for : — I., William Brewster 
and the Independents; II., Roger Williams and 
his Doctrine of Soul Liberty; III., Thomas 
Hooker and the Principle of Congregational

Independency ; IV., William Penn and the Gos- 
pel o£ the Inner Light; V., Thomas Jefferson 
and the Influence of Democracy upon Religion; 
VI., William Ellery Channing and the Growth 
of Spiritual Christianity ; VII., Horace Bush- 
nell and Progressive Orthodoxy; VIII., Hosea 
Ballon and the Larger Hope ; IX., Ralph Waldo 
Emerson and the Doctrine of the Divine 
Immanence; X., Theodore Parker and the 
Naturalisration of Religion ; XL, Phillips Brooks 
and the Unity of the Spirit. 

The lectures are naturally rather unequal in 
merit, but the recital of the thoughts and deeds 
of the eleven men enumerated could hardly be 
otherwise than inspiring. Regarding the some- 
what broken narrative as a whole, we see the 
early struggle for physical freedom, — the right 
not merely to think, but to act and speak in 
accordance with the inner light. Said Roger 
Williams in 1631, ' The civil sword may make a 
nation of hypocrites and anti-Christians, but 
not one Christian. . . . Persons may with 
less sin be forced to marry whom they cannot 
love than to worship where they cannot believe.' 
Liberty achieved in outward form, the struggle 
was followed by a period of calm, and it was 
half forgotten that there was anything to 
struggle for. The State Church was established 
in the land, and dogma stood for religion. A 
barrier had been raised up, it could not be 
improved away, and the alternative of revolu- 
tion remained. Who will doubt that this nation 
came into being as much from a psychological 
as a physical necessity? So it followed that 
Jeiferson and Channing, Bushnell and Ballon, 
stood for the freedom of the mind, and inde- 
pendent churches came into being. In the time 
that followed, man's mental horizon was broad- 
ened by science, and new adjustments became 
necessary. It seemed to many an earnest soul 
that the foundations of belief were sapped, and 
the expansion permitted by freedom had con- 
verted what was once solid into mere nebulosity. 
Yet there were some who understood, and thus 
came forward the prophets of modern times, 
whose voices still ring in our ears. 

In all of this, directive purpose seems 
strangely combined with streaks of perversity, 
— blind alle\& of thought, as it were. Our poor 
old human race moves more like a man in the 
dark than an athlete running for a prize. Yet 
we go forward, and do not doubt that the prize 
is waiting, though we have no very clear idea 
what it is. 

In the lecture on Emerson (pp. 321, 323), 
Dr. Peabody quotes and criticises a statement 
of Theodore Parker's that, ' If Christianity be 
true at all, it would be just as true if Herod 
or Catiline had taught it.' It is_ very justly 
objected, that the supposition itself is an absurd- 
ity; but the idea did not originate with Parker,

for long ago Luther wrote ' the book which 
preaches Christ is apostolic, were its author 
Judas, Annas, Pilate, or Herod.' 

Dr. Crocker, in his work on ' Eeligious Free- 
dom in American Education' presents an 
analysis land discussion of the educational insti- 
tutions of this country in their relation to relig- 
ious dogma. The book is that of a propagandist, 
not that of a scientific student. Dr. Crooker is 
of course opposed to any sort of union. of Church 
and State, and says: 

' That is the best arrangement, for all interests 
and institutions, which keeps the Public School 
close to its special work and frees it from all other 
responsibilities, which commits religious instruc- 
tion to those who are called of God to give it, and 
which leaves the Bible to make its way into the 
heart, not by compulsion and formality, but along 
the lines of persuasion which center in home and 
church' (p. 82). 

Then, as to the teaching of morals, — . 

' Shall, then, our Public Schools teach a for- 
mal moral code? No, rather let them possess a 
moral atmosphere derived from the personality of 
the teacher. . . . Place a Horace Mann or a 
Thomas Arnold in a school-room, and that school 
will possess more moral power than resides in all 
the ethical handbooks in the whole world ' (p. 45). 

Very well, but how about the quality of the 
teachers we have ? We are told, — • 

' In intelligence, singleness of purpose, purity 
of life, there is not a priesthood in the world that 
outranks them ; and there are few that equal them. 
Is it not a frightful slander to call our Public 
Schools irreligious, when, in fact, they are taught 
by as noble and saintly a band of workers as ever 
consecrated themselves to the service of human- 
ity? ' (p. 35.) 

Positively, we begin to feel a little dizzy. 
Extremes sometimes meet, and it is fair to ask 
whether, in our undoubtedly righteous zeal for 
non-sectarian schools, we may not sometimes 
leave our children totally at the mercy of bigots 
on the one hand, or hard-hearted materialism 
on the other. A great part of the purpose of 
education is to . put the child in the possession 
of the ripest fruits of the mental travail of the 
race; and if anyone believes that that can be 
done without referring to religion, he strangely 
misconceives both history and the human mind. 
To leave the child to 'those called of God,' 
according to their own designation, is frequently 
to leave him to narrow, warped, or misleading 
teachers; and if any sectarian feels injured by 
this statement, I beg him to consider that it 
refers not to his sect, but to all others. The 
exclusion of dogma from the schools, and the 
search for noble teachers, — these are aims 
worthy of all support; but when we get the 
right men and women, let us not curtail their 
freedoui, nor prevent them from freely impart- 
ing the fruits of their own spiritual develop- 
ment. T. D. A. COCKERELL. 



Briefs of New Books. 

w h- t ' ^^' Washington's 'Working 
gospel of Taboj^ """^ with the Hands' (Doubleday, 
Page & Co.) is a logical and 
satisfactory sequel to his 'Up from Slavery.' 
At first thought, the new book seems to 
add little to the autobiography; it re-affirms 
the 'gospel of hard work with head and 
hands,' and it retells the story of Tus- 
kegee, only with more detail. But in final 
analysis it proves to go farther. 'Up from 
Slavery' explained the man and stated his theo- 
rem; 'Working with the Hands' gives the dem- 
onstration, full in fact and experience, and states 
the far-reaching corollaries. Nor will any of us 
who believe in the 'worth of work with the hands 
as an uplifting power in real education' weary 
of learning how that power has been exemplified 
at Tuskegee, in farm and wagon-shops, brick-yard 
and foundry, class-room, laboratory, and kitchen, 
until the community has become not only almost 
self-equipj>ed, but as elevated in tone, compara- 
tively, as Brook Farm itself. The book is rightly 
called 'Working with the Hands' rather than 
'The Story of Tuskegee.' The principle is much 
larger than the institution, and the author tells 
something of its wider application. How far he 
himself, following General Armstrong's lead, has 
stimulated the impulse toward manual training 
in all education, North and South, it is aside 
from his modesty to say, even if he could. But 
he realizes and insists upon the economic and 
political importance of his work. 'It was this 
training of the hands,' he says, 'that furnished 
the first basis for united and sympathetic inter- 
est and action between the two races at the South, 
and the whites at the North and those at the 
South.' He calls attention to the fact that the 
industries of Porto Rico, Hayti, and parts of 
Africa, are being transformed by men trained at 
Tuskegee; and he believes that moral and relig- 
ious transformation will follow the economic. 
'After diligent investigation,' he says, 'I have 
been unable to find a dozen former students in 
idleness. They are busy in schoolroom, field, 
shop, home, or church. They are busy because 
they have placed themselves in demand by learn- 
ing to do that which the world wants done, and 
because they have learned the disgrace of idle- 
ness and the sweetness of labor.' The lover of 
mankind, and of poetry, cannot help dreaming 
of what life and literature will be like, when the 
Man with the Hoe— the man 

' dead to rapture and despair, 
A- thing that grieves not and that never hopes,' 

shall have been replaced by the man Mr. Wash- 
ington is training, whose hand, head, and heart 
are educated in service, and who knows the sweet- 
ness and dignity of labor.

from the Louisiana Purchase to the purchase of 
the Filipinos and their archipelago. The au- 
thor shows that nowhere have any considerations 
other than those of material interest been per- 
mitted to stand in the way of the acquisition of 
empire, from Jefferson's extra-constitutional 
negotiations with the first Napoleon, through the 
Mexican War, to the Treaty of Paris by which 
the Philippines were brought under the flag but 
not under the constitution. He is convinced that 
Cuba will fall into our laps, like a ripened cocoa- 
nut; he considers the annexation of Mexico and 
the Central American republics possible; he 
weighs the chances of bringing the Canadian 
provinces into the sisterhood of states, and the 
thought of drawing the southern line of ' greater 
America ' at the river Amazon after extending 
it to the North Pole is rather a serious one with 
him. The islands of the Caribbean are taken up 
one by one, and their future settled, with the pos- 
sibilities of the Dutch West Indies coming into 
the hands of Germany. The government of the 
United States is explained in detail for the bene- 
fit of his British readers, as the administration 
of the Indian empire is detailed for Americans. 
The problems of expansion are considered in the 
light of these two systems, and the Filipino is set 
down as incapable of self-government from any 
American point of view, with a smile for those 
who would disregard the teachings of history in 
the tropics. A larger navy is insisted upon, as 
Great Britain and the United States cannot con- 
sent to the overthrow of Japan as a naval factor 
in the balance of power necessary to progress on 
the farther shores of the Pacific. The book is 
frankly materialistic in its point of view, and is 
calculated to delight the hearts of all true im- 
perialists. Needless to say, it does not set forth 
the final historical fact that imperial nations have 
uniformly gone down into the abysses of history, 
while only those, like China, which have been 
steady advocates of peace, have been long able 
to survive. 

While the world is waiting for 
theatatetman Lord Kowton to publish the long- 
expected full and satisfactory life 
of the man he so devotedly served as secretarj'^, 
various writers, without his qualifications and 
resources for the task, give us from time to time 
their accounts, now fragmentary and now more 
nearly complete, of that remarkable career. In 
a small volume about as large as one of our 
* Beacon Biographies,' Mr. Walter Sichel pre- 
sents an outline of Disraeli's public life, briefly 
naming his book ' Beaconsfield ' (Dutton). Hav- 
ing already treated his subject from another 
point of view in his * Disraeli: A Study in Per- 
sonality and Ideas,' the author now devotes his 
attention to Lord Beaconsfield 's political career. 
From the first he shows himself a thorough-going 
admirer of the brilliant statesman. Accordingly 
the less admirable traits of his character are 
either left undelineated or are but faintly sug- 
gested. Only the briefest reference is made to 
the famous squabble with O'Connell, and there 
is no mention of the altercation with Joseph 
Himie. To readers not having something like a 



professional love for the details of English polit- 
ical history,— the ups and downs of reform move- 
ments, the perpetual clashing of parties, the fate 
of this, that, or the other bill in Parliament, — 
the book will seem somewhat of a twice-told tale, 
so often has its subject-matter been handled by 
previous writers. Touching on our own Civil 
War and his country's attitude in the matter, 
Mr. Sichel voices a probably erroneous impres- 
sion when he says, ' The natural sympathies of 
the nation . . . were with the South.' That 
the English people as a whole espoused the pro- 
slavery cause, has long been regarded as more 
than doubtful. Indeed, some convincing evi- 
dence of the right-mindedness of the English 
press at the time has recently been published, as 
the reader may remember. For a handy outline, 
agreeably illustrated with a dozen portraits and 
other views, this little book is to be commended. 

The study of In view of the present celebration 
government of the Louisiana Purchase and the 
in Wyoming, projected memorial of the travels of 
Lewis and Clark next year. Dr. Grace Raymond 
Hebard's book on 'The Government of Wyom- 
ing' (Whitaker & Ray) comes very opportunely 
to remind us of the unique position of that state 
as being embraced in all the four large cessions 
of land west of the Mississippi. Dr. Hebard has 
the faculty of writing very lucidly and interest- 
ingly about what is too often deemed 'too dry' 
a subject. An excellent chronological table makes 
clear the various stages in the formation of the 
territory and its subsequent development, and 
the historical portions of the book are very 
acceptable. Its chief interest lies, of course, in 
what concerns its government. As an attorney- 
at-law, the author possesses the equipment needed 
to make the chapters on Administration and 
Justice (as explaining the legal steps from 
arrest to conviction or acquittal in civil and crimi- 
nal cases) instructive and helpful. Other timely 
topics are the chapters discussing the constitu- 
tional conventions and the convention which led 
to Statehood, the Australian ballot-system intro- 
duced in the State by the author's brother, the 
elective franchise, the land-boards, the irriga- 
tion laws, and the benefits of forest resei'ves (of 
particular interest to the 'arid' West), — a 
range of topics of more than local interest, use- 
ful and necessary to all classes. The errors are 
few, and only such as might slip in unawares into 
any book ; while a list of questions and references 
at the end of each chapter, good illustrations, 
ma^s, and appendices, besides a complete index, 
make the volume a very satisfactory contribu- 
tion to our scant literature on this subject. The 
study of government in Wyoming has not hith- 
erto been aided by a satisfactory text-book. This 
little volume is cordially recommended as a handy 
reference-book for libraries where this j>ortion of 
our history is not often adequately represented.

contained in the form of fiction the severest of 
criticisms upon the conduct of officers of the 
German military establishment in times of 
peace — by telling the truth about them. His 
book, it may be remembered, resulted in a gen- 
eral inquiry on the part of the German Emperor 
into his most highly favored national institution, 
the result of which was so far confirmatory of 
the things described that the old and barbarous 
rule of English law, ' the greater the truth the 
greater the libel,' must be in force in Germany, 
at least among the military. Mr. Wolf von 
Sehierbrand has translated the story into Eng- 
lish, with the title of * A Little Garrison ' 
(Stokes), providing it with an introduction in 
which he sets forth these facts, telling his read- 
ers that he was obliged to suppress some of the 
episodes in it as too strong for American read- 
ing. Those remaining tend to show that, with 
notable exceptions, the German officer is a moral 
coward, a bully, a thief, a liar, a petty swin- 
dler, a gambler, an absconder, a drunkard, a liber- 
tine, and several other unpleasant things. This is 
in times of peace ; in times of war, as Mr. Kipling 
has noted, he is a hero. The problem appears to 
be to force a man who is taught as a matter of 
professional duty to disregard during a time of 
war every law, human and divine, prescribed for 
good conduct, to observe all those laws when it 
has not been made permissible for him to become 
a chartered murderer, thief, liar, and the rest. 
It is not stated in just those terms by Mr. von 
Sehierbrand, Lieutenant Bilse, or the commenta- 
tors on the book at home or abroad; and, so 
stated, it does not appear to be a problem capable 
of easy solution. The one remedy likely to be 
efficacious would seem to be the discouragement 
of the military spirit. Germany, however, is little 
likely to do this.

deal some ten years ago, has pub- 
lished her impressions of various royal person- 
ages in an attractive volume entitled ' Kings and 
Queens I have Known ' (Harper). Pope Leo 
XIII. also has a place in the list, which includes 
most of the reigning sovereigns of Europe. Al- 
though the writer professes to give personal rem- 
iniscences, her book — with the exception of the 
chapter on Queen Elizabeth of Roumania (Car- 
men Sylva), to whom she is a lady-in-waiting — 
is largely of the kind that a well-appointed 
library would easily enable a less privileged person 
to manufacture; and of Queen Wilhelmina, one 
of her most interesting characters, she gives noth- 
ing at all that savors of personal impression. 
Her style lacks simplicity and restraint; all 
things wear a glamor of romance to her view, and 
everj' situation must yield its bit of sentiment 
and poetry. She is a poet, and insists on remain- 
ing one even in her prose. Delighting in what she 
calls ' brilliant accesses of force and desire, pas- 
sionate thrillings of souls ever ready to court 
peril,' she has written a book which it would be 
foolishness to treat as a sober narrative of facts. 
The Emperor of Austria she pictures as an un- 
happy husband, deserted for long periods by his 



errant consort. Describing her meeting with the 
German Emperor and Empress at Sigmaringen, 
she writes, with unaccountable self-contradiction : 
' Sigmaringen Schloss has for many hundred 
years belonged to the Catholic branch of the 
HohenzoUern family, who bear no relationship 
Avhatever to the younger and more prosperous 
line.' Portraits accompany all the chapters ex- 
cept that on the late King and Queen of Servia, 
and Mile. Yacareseo herself appears in the 
frontispiece. 

The depth of devotion which 
Birds' nests and eggs i ^ . „„-4.„ „,„i, „ 

of North America. f^^^^ ^ ^.^^ tO write SUCn a 

book as that of Mr. Chester 
A. Reed on 'North American Birds' Eggs' (Dou- 
bleday. Page & Co.) can be comprehended only 
by the true bird-lover. Mr. Reed's descrip- 
tions of the birds themselves, which cover 
practically all the spjecies on the continent 
— nearly eight hundred —are not full enough 
to be of much value for purposes of iden- 
tification, but are intended only to introduce 
the fuller descriptions of nests and e^s. 
As Mr. Reed says, 'The greatest interest 
in the study of birds centres in their home-life'; 
and his purpose is to add to popular knowledge 
on this subject. He does not wish to stimulate 
the indiscriminate collecting of birds' eggs, but 
recognizes the fact that 'knowledge does not 
imply possession, ' and that the collector is one of 
the enemies of bird-life. Except in the cases of 
sub-species that deviate only slightly from the 
type, life-size drawings of the eggs are given, 
showing shape and markings with minute fidelity. 
These cuts are in black-and-white, but the colors 
are carefully described, so that the record is 
complete. It is an interesting novelty in bird- 
literature to find the illustrations of eggs given 
in full on the page, while thumb-nail sketches of 
the birds appear in the margin. To most readers, 
the seventy additional illustrations, most of them 
full-page, showing nests and their surroundings, 
will appeal as the most interesting feature of the 
book, — so interesting, in fact, as to make the 
book worth while if it had no other value. The 
literary critic will wince a little, however, at see- 
ing these beautiful pictures labeled 'photos,' and 
at frequent awkward espressions in the text. 

A distinguished Russia, France and the United 
Englishwoman States have each furnished some 
of Science. Ulustrious names to the list of 

women who have achieved fame in the fields of 
pure or applied science, but not many have found 
the British environment conducive to this result. 
An exception, however, must be made in the case 
of Miss Eleanor Ormerod, England's most noted 
economic entomologist. That her fame was not 
merely a local one is evidenced by the array of 
eminent correspondents in all civilized lands and 
some far corners of the earth who have contrib- 
uted to her 'Autobiography and Correspondence' 
(Dutton). This has been edited and coinpiled by 
Professor Robert Wallace of the University of 
Edinburgh, of which institution she was the first 
woman honorary graduate. Her correspondence, 
here published for the first time, will be of espe- 



68. 



THE DIAL 



[August 1, 



eial interest to all economic entomologists. The 
moderation and eminent good-sense which charac- 
terized her 'Annual Reports' (1877-1898) won 
for her a high place in the esteem of her co-work- 
ers throughout the world. Her services to the 
Royal Agricultural Society and the Royal Agri- 
cultural College, and in behalf of agricultural 
education, were given freely and ungrudgingly, 
and may yet bear fruit when England awakens 
to the fact that science, even applied entomology, 
has its place in the schedules of the modem uni- 
versity. The extensive correspondence and abun- 
dant illustrations give a technical value to the 
book for the specialist, and the story of this use- 
ful and successful life should be inspiration to 
others who have similar means and leisure for a 
scientific career. 

Mr. Henry W. Nevinson, known to 
ST;^ the literary world as war corre- 

spondent of ' The Daily Chron- 
icle ' and author of * Ladysmith : the Diary of a 
Siege,' and other books, has turned his South- 
African and other professional experiences to ac- 
count in a collection of miscellanies, mostly fic- 
tion, entitled ' Between the Acts ' (Dutton). 
Four of the stories have to do with Boers and 
Kaffirs, kraals and kopjes, and like things and 
persons. Nevertheless, despite the abundance of 
local color, the tales are not always convincing, 
as, for example, when, in a besieged and starv- 
ing village, a hen not only figures in a thriving 
condition, without visible means of support, but 
even achieves the laying of an egg\ Two stories 
of university life, one at Jena, the other at Ox- 
ford, are somewhat amusingly burlesque. Two 
autobiographical chapters, one Greco-Turkish 
war story, one slum story, two love stories, one 
journalist's tale, and one Spanish sketch, with a 
bit of verse at the end of each, complete the 
volume. Some of the poems are graceful, occa- 
sionally attaining a neatness that is almost epi- 
grammatic, and a few of the stories are ingenious; 
but the book will hardly place the author on that 
* pinnacle of fame ' which gives the title of his 
concluding chapter. 

The beautiful downs of Sussex are 
g" sTex a treasure-house of English his- 

tory. Mr. Lucas's ' Highways 
and Byways in Sussex ' (Ma<5millan) reveals the 
instinct of the archaeologist, the historian, and 
the litterateur. Mr. Lucas wandered aloilg the 
chalk cliffs, over the downs, up the little river 
valleys, and among the ruins of ancient glory, 
with open eyes and mind. Churchyards, castles, 
groves, hedgerows, and villages, all told him 
stories which he has incorporated in this volume. 
Seventy-six well-executed sketches of buildings, 
landscapes, groves, parks, and street scenes, by 
Mr. ¥. L. Griggs, add to the vividness of the nar- 
rative. A good map of Sussex, with its cities, 
towns, rivers, downs, and highways, helps the 
reader in his trips across country with his guide. 
In these excursions we get glimpses of many fam- 
ous characters: we find Queen Elizabeth at 



Cowdray, Dr. Johnson at Windhurst, William 
Collins at Chichester, Cowper at Eastham, Shel- 
ley at Horsham, Cobbett at Billinghurst, Pope at 
West Grinstead, Swinburne at Shoreham, and 
Charles Lamb at Hastings. We get traces of 
Romans, Britons, Saxons and Normans, as at 
Pevensey Castle, where William the Conqueror 
was present in person. Such compilations have 
their place in the collections on English historical 
geography. 



Notes. 



Some ' Selected Sermons of Jonathan Edwards,' 
edited by Prof. H. Norman Gardiner, is a new 
' Pocket Classic ' publislied by tlie Macmillan Co. 

' Twelve Christmas Stories,' by Charles Dickens, 
edited by Miss Jane Gordon, is one of the ' Eclectic 
School Readings ' published by the American Book 
Co. 

'Arithmetic Made Easy for Teachers and Pu- 
pils,' by Miss Mabel A. Marsh, is a text-book of 
teaching method published by Messrs. E. P. Dutton 
& Co. 

' The Dramatic Element in the Popular Ballad ' 
is the subject of a study by Mr. George Morey 
Miller, just issued as a publication of the Univer- 
sity of Cincinnati. 

Mr. John Lane publishes, in his attractive and 
inexpensive ' Canvasback Library,' a new edition 
of Herr Sudermann's ' Regina,' in Miss Beatrice 
Marshall's translation. 

' Dux Christus,' by Dr. William Elliot Grlffis, 
is an outline study of religious Japan, just pub- 
lished by the Macmillan Co. in a series of volumes 
devoted mainly to foreign missions. 

' A First Latin Writer,' by Mr. Mather A. Abbott, 
is a recent publication of the American Book 
Co., who also send us the ' Elements of Algebra for 
Beginners,' by Professor George W. Hall. 

Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. announce a new series 
of American biographies, in many volumes, classi- 
fied according to occupations. Some two dozen 
volumes are well under way, each comprising from 
a half-dozen to a score of biographies. 

' The Mathematical Theory of Eclipses,' accord- 
ing to the Chauvenet-Bessel method, is the subject 
of a treatise by Mr. Roberdeau Buchanan. The 
work has an appendix on transits and occulta- 
tions, and is published by the J. B. Lippincott Co. 

'A Primer of Philosophy," by Dr. A. S. Rappo- 
port, is a diminutive but compact book published 
by Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. Its purpose is to 
supply the beginner in philosophy with a kind of 
student's guide to the problems of the science and 
the solutions which have been proposed. 

George Lawrence's ' Brakespeare ' was published 
a full generation ago, and strikingly anticipated 
the type of romantic historical fiction of which so 
much has been written in our own day. The new 
edition just published by Messrs. F. M. Buckles & 
Co. should, therefore, not fail to attract a new set 
of readers for this once fairly famous book.

' Our Own and Other Worlds,' by Mr. Joseph 
Hamilton, is an illustrated book of popular as- 
tronomy, published by Messrs. Eaton & Mains. The 
work has a marked religious flavor, and the writer 
seems to be a sort of up-to-date Ormsby Mitchell. 

' Connectives of English Speech,' by Mr. James 
C. Fernald, is a publication of the Funk & Wag- 
nails Co. It is a practical treatise, with abundant 
illustrations, upon ' the correct usage of preposi- 
tions, conjunctions, relative pronouns, and ad- 
verbs.' 

Lesslng's ' Minna von Barnhelm,' edited by Mr. 
Richard Alexander von Minckwitz and Miss Anne 
Crombie Wilder, is a recent German text published 
by Messrs. Ginn & Co., who also send lis Fred- 
erich Gerstacker's ' Germelshausen,' edited by Mr. 
Griffin M. Lovelace. 

Twenty volumes of the ' Kensington ' Thackeray 
are now at hand, the latest of which are the four 
containing ' The Paris Sketch Book,' ' Barry Lyn- 
don,' ' The Great Hoggarty Diamond,' and ' The 
Irish Sketch Book,' Messrs. Charles Scribner's 
Sons are the publishers. 

From MM. Firmin-Didot & Co.. Paris, we have 
Volumes II. and III. of ' La Guerre de Sept Ans,' by 
M. Richard Waddington, completing this valuable 
work of diplomatic and military history. The two 
volumes aggregate over a thousand pages, and are 
furnished with numerous maps and plans. The 
work is strictly one of original research, being 
based upon a thorough examination of the archives 
of several European countries. 

Mr. Sidney Lee's collection of ' Elizabethan Son- 
nets Newly Arranged and Indexed ' occupies two 
volumes in the reissue of Arber's ' English Gar- 
ner,' now being published by Messrs. E. P. But- 
ton & Co. Mr. Lee's introduction, an essay of 
nearly a hundred pages, is an important contri- 
bution to the history of English literature, and 
gives exceptional value to this work, otherwise 
sufficiently valuable in itself as a collection of 
material not elsewhere easily accessible. 

Messrs. E. P. Button & Co. are the publishers of 
a series of French and German text-books, English 
in origin, of which the following volumes have 
just been received: ' Grammaire Frangaise,' by 
Messrs. W. Mansfield Poole and Michel Becker; 
' Intermediate French Grammar,' by Messrs. G. H. 
Clarke and L. R. Tanquerey; ' Commercial French ' 
(two volumes), by Messrs. W. Mansfield Poole and 
Michel Becker; and 'Commercial German' (two 
volumes), by Messrs. Gustav Hein and Michel 
Becker. 

Br. Ellis P. Oberholtzer is preparing for Messrs. 
George W. Jacobs & Co. an edition, in several 
volumes, of the diary and writings of Robert Mor- 
ris, the financier of the American Revolution. It 
is now close upon a hundred years since the death 
of Morris, and this edition is appropriately planned 
as a centennial commemoration. The editor asks 
for permission to copy any of Morris's letters or 
other papers that may be in the hands of private 
owners, and promises their prompt return if sent 
to him for that purpose.

Chamberlin & Salisbury's Geology 

By Thomas C. Chamberlin and Rollin D. Salisbury, Professors in the University of Chicago. (American 
Science Series.) 2 vols. 8vo. 

Vol. I. Geological Processes and their Results. 654 pp. $4.00 net. 
Vol. II. Earth History. (In preparation.) 
This is a notable scientific work by two of the highest authorities on the subject in the United States, and yet written 
in a style so simple that it can be clearly understood by the intelligent reader who has had little previous training in the sub- 
ject. One of its niost notable features is the abundance of photographic illustrations, based upon the most recent researches. 
HENRY S. WILLIAMS, Professor in Yale UniTersity : I believe it is the best treatise on this part of the subject we have seen in America. 
CHARLES D. WALCOTT, Director of U. S. Geological Survey : I am impressed with the admirable plan of the work and with the 
thorough manner in which geological principles and processes and their results have been presented. The text is written In an entertaining 
style and is supplemented by admirable illustrations, so that the student cannot fail to obtain a clear idea of the nature and work of geologicu 
agencies, of the present status of the science, and of the spirit which actuates the working geologist. 

Fournier's Napoleon 

By A. FouRNiER, Professor in the German University of Prague. 

Translated under the editorship of Edward G. Bourne, Professor of History in Yale University. 750 pp. 

12mo. $2.00 net. 

Since its original publication this work has been generally recognized as the best life of Napoleon in moderate compass 

that has been written. No pains have been spared to present the author's clear and trenchant narrative in idiomatic English. 

FRANK GOODRICH, Professor in Williams College: I have long desired to have it rendered more accessible to American students. 

The whole is a most valuable addition to the equipment of the student of this important period of history. 

Temple School Shakespeare, price, 35 cents net, each.

Julius Caesar. Edited by F. Armitage Morley, M.A. As Vou Like It. Edited by Flora Masson. 
WILLIAM E. SIMONDS, Knox College, 111. : The form of Introduction and the arrangement of notes and glossary are quite ideal. I 

consider that the illustrations are unique and of great assistance to the text. The reproductions in the notes are of extraordinary value and a 

distinct feature. I wish that I were an editor of such a helpful edition as this. 

Seager's Introduction to Economics 

By Professor Henry R. Seager, of Columbia. 560 pp. 8vo. $2.00 net. 

The principles of Economics in vital relation to the facts and problems of contemporary business life. A distinctive 
feature is the introductory sketch of the rise and progress of modem industry in England and the United States. 

W. M. DANIELS, Professor in Princeton University : I do not know of a more readable presentation of the theory of Economies with a 
■aner outlook on the practical problems of industry.

Bierwirth's Beginning German 

By Dr. H. C. Bif.rwirth, of Harvard. 214 pp. 12mo. 80 cents net. 

Provides not only a simple approach to the study of essentials necessary to the beginner, but also a short abstract of 
grammar useful for second year work. 

H. J. LENSNER, West High School, Cleveland, Ohio : I have been highly pleased with its use in my classes. The results are excellent 
It is the best first-year German grammar exercise book I have seen. 

J. W. THOMAS, Boys' High School, Brooklyn : The vocabularies are practical. The exercises are rational and of suflBcient fulness. There 
are no hobbies. The giving of the commonest compounds of strong verbs along with the principal parts of these is most useful. The chapter on 
■tem-groups, though much fuller than is usual in elementary works, seems to me to be a very valuable feature. 

Vos*s Essentials of German 

By Professor B. J. Vos, of Johns Hopkins. 222 pp. 12mo. 80 cents net. 

Special emphasis is laid on practice rather than theory. Exercises are abundant and interesting, and colloquial drill 
18 provided as work to be prepared. 

AMALIE NIX, Central High School, St. Paul, Minn. : I consider it excellent for beginners in German. It is easy to comprehend, logical 
and practical, in fact one of the best of its kind that I have seen. 

FRIEDA VON UNWERTH, Central High School, Kansas City, Mo.: The exercises are not so difficult as to discourage and confuse the 
student, and yet difficult enough to hold the attention. The principles of grammar are stated clearly and concisely and are wisely selected. 1 
like especially the treatment of the subjunctive, which as presented in many of the grammars forms such a stumbling block to the average 
student. 

Roscher's Spanish Colonial System 

Translated and edited by Professor E. G. Bourne, of Yale. 48 pp. 8vo. Paper. 50 cents net.

THi: QUESTION OF SECONDARY 
ED UCAT ION. 

The problem of the secondary school is well 
to the foreground in current educational dis- 
cussion, both in this country and in Eiigland, 
and the fact that its importance is thus gen- 
erally realized constitutes one of tihe most 
encouraging signs of the educational times. Its 
prominence is emphasized Just now by the pub- 
lication of a full stenographic report of the 
proceedings of the National Conference on 
Secondary Education and Its Problems, held at 



the Northwestern University last October, and 
attended by representative high-school men 
from all parts of the country. This report 
ranks high among the educational documents of 
recent years, and makes reading of an excep- 
tionally interesting sort. 

The main objects of the conference are stated 
in the following terms: 

' It was intended that the conference should be 
quite different from the ordinary teachers' conven- 
tion or association called to discuss purely peda- 
gogical questions in the narrow sense. It did not 
purpose to deal with the problem of teaching arith- 
metic or algebra or Latin or Greek, nor with the 
best methods of integrating the branches of study 
which constitute the curriculum, nor was it to dis- 
cuss the respective merits of the classics and mod- 
ern languages or natural science as means of 
literary culture. It was decided to leave all such 
questions relating to pedagogy in the n&rrow sense 
of the term to one side, and concentrate the inter- 
est of the conference upon what may be called the 
broader elements of educational statesmanship 
involved in the organization of a national system 
of secondary education.' , 

The general trend of the discussion thus 
determined, it remained to fix upon the specific 
subjects to be taken up, and they were finally 
grouped under the following heads: (1) The 
function of the private school. (2) The func- 
tion of the public high school. (3) The sys- 
tem of accrediting schools by universities. (4) 
Moral and religious training. (5) Defects of 
our high school system. The questions raised 
by these subjects ' go to the very root of our 
social and educational life,' as President James 
suggested in his call for the conference, and 
their discussion developed a line of argument 
which seems, in the reading, noteworthy for 
its general ability and breadth of view. 

Before taking up these topics separately, we 
must call attention to the opening address on 
' The Present Situation in Secondary Educa- 
tion,' made by Mr. Alfred E. Stearns of the 
Phillips Andover Academy, because it set what 
politicians call a 'keynote' for the ensuing 
debates, and started the conference upon the 
highest possible plane. This address first 
emphasizes the plastic characters of the years 
from twelve to twenty, and asserts the para- 
mount necessity of giving a wise and firm direc- 
tion to the work of students. The danger of an 
early specialization is thus set forth : 

' The youth who enters the high school or 
academy is altogether too apt to be concerned, not 



78 



THE DIAL, 



[August 16» 



with the mental training and discipline which the 
secandary school should furnish, but merely with 
those individual subjects which he believes will 
serve his chosen end. . . . The sound and thor- 
ough drill, the well-rounded training which would 
best fit him to meet the special demands of his 
later calling, whatever that calling may be, these 
are spurned as old-fashioned, or at least as of no 
practical value to him.' 

These are words of wisdom, spoken in an 
age which is witnessing the steady demoraliza- 
tion of high-school courses by their presentation 
of an elective system to minds too immature 
to make an intelligent choice. Significant also 
in the highest degree is what Mr. Steams says 
of the failure of the modem home to co-operate 
with the school in its work. 

' The decadence of a normal and healthy family 
life in America, and with it that sound and sensible 
home training which in the past has been one of 
the greatest sources of the strength of the Republic, 
presents a situation which has well aroused the 
anxiety of thoughtful men. It is hard to exaggerate 
this deplorable condition, and nowhere are its evils 
more clearly recognized than in the secondary 
school. . . . Pitiable in the extreme is the lot 
of the child of parents of wealth and influence. 
Business and professional demands for the one, 
and exacting social requirements for the other, 
render it impossible for the father or mother to 
give to the developing character of the child the 
thought and guidance that is any child's birthright. 
. . . Nor is this condition confined to the chil- 
dren of the rich alone. It will be found in an 
increasing degree in almost all classes of society, 
among men of intellect as well as among men of 
money; and one of the most pathetic features of 
the situation lies in the fact that men who owe 
their success in life to the struggle and discipline 
of their youthful days persist in denying to their 
children those very conditions and opportunities 
by which their own success was made possible.' 

Discussion of the first general topic on the 
list, the function of the private school, was 
mainly in the hands of speakers who are 
engaged in directing such institutions, and 
they naturally said what they could in sup- 
port of that method of education. And there is 
much, no doubt, that can fairly be said in 
behalf of the private school. As compared with 
the public school, it frequently offers a better 
system of management, a closer attention to the 
needs of the individual, and more efficient 
instruction. But the thing that ought to be 
emphasized upon every such occasion as this, 
and that was not properl}^ emphasized at the 
EVanstion conference, is the principle that the 
community has no more imperative duty than 
that of making the public school distinctly 
better than any private institution. This may 
seem a counsel of perfection, but it sets a goal 
toward which we should constantly strive. In 
many communities it is a condition fully real- 



ized; it should bo realized in all the others. 
For nothing is more vital to the preservation of 
democracy than that the children of all classes 
should mingle with each other at school upon 
a common footing of equality. Class distinc- 
tions are more out of place in education than 
anywhere else, and to .give the slightest coun- 
tenance to the notion that the public schools 
are for the children of the poor only is to work 
the most insidious and lasting harm to the 
social healii. About the poorest sort of citizen 
in any community is the one who gradges the 
few dollars per pupil that are expended upon 
the public schools, while willingly paying hun- 
dreds of dollars apiece for the education of his 
own children in private academies. 

The speakers who had for their topic the 
function of the public high school kept their 
discussion, for the most part, at a high philo- 
sophical level. The mean view of that function, 
which would have the school provide what its 
childish constituents want, or think they want, 
instead of providing what professional educa- 
tors know they ought to have, found occasional 
expression, but the principal weight of the argu- 
ment was on tlie right side, and kept close to the 
essentials. In these days of reckless educational 
experimentation, it is refreshing to hear such 
words of plain and sober truth as these of Pro- 
fessor Boodin of Iowa College: 

* It seems to me that our ancestors builded wiser 
than they knew, that the old course of the New 
England grammar school, as thus modernized, com- 
plies on the whole with the rational idea of educa- 
tion, and furnishes at least a working basis, 
whereas the elective system is the mere absence of 
an ideal, frivolity run mad.' 

Tlie topic of the accrediting system devel- 
oped a considerable body of opinion in favor 
of the admission to the university, without 
examination, of the graduates of well-equipped 
high schools. One speaker stated that ' the 
accrediting system gives the college students 
with a better average preparation,' and pre- 
sented some statistics which strikingly support 
that position. There was practically no dissent 
from the general approval bestowed upon this 
method of determining the fitness of students 
to enter college, and the subject, not lending 
itself to controversy, was so speedily disposed 
of that the later speakers began to wander into 
other fields, and notably into that contentious 
area where the question of moral and religious 
instruction is debated. When it was pointed 
out that this was to be the subject for the open- 
ing discussion on the day following, the con- 
ference adjourned, to listen that evening to an 
extremely interesting address, albeit a trifle 
incoherent and eccentric, by Mr, Henr}' S. Bou- 
tell, who spoke upon the public high school as 
the training-school of good citizenship.

THE DIAI.

When the conference met for its second day's 
work, the topic of moral and religious training 
was taken np for serious treatment. Somewhat 
to our surprise, considering the auspices under 
which the conference was held, the discussion 
resulted, on the whole, in a pronouncement 
against such training as a specific exercise, 
although, of course, much stress was laid upon 
the moral and religious elements that are inher- 
ent in all good tieaching and orderly discipline. 
Professor Doan, of the Ohio University, opened 
the discussion with a combination of acute 
analysis and convincing argument which de- 
serves very high praise. He thus describes the 
danger of placing any text of formal ethics in 
the hands of the child. 

' Perhaps the child will learn its headings and 
paragraphs by rote. Yet if there is any one time 
and any one discipline wherein rote-learning is a 
harren waste it is the ethical discipline of adoles- 
cence. Or else the pupil will be made too intro- 
spective. Yet during the period of adolescence 
with its emotional instability introspection should 
be avoided as a moral or spiritual pestilence.' 

Other speakers, among them Professor O'Shea 
and Dr. Tompkins, added the weight of their 
experience and judgment to the argument 
against a set form of training in these matters, 
and Professor Folwell helped to clear the air 
by a few plain blunt words : 

' I have a right to send my children to the 
schools for school work, to have them let alone in 
their religion. As for morals, I do not care as a 
teacher for an opportunity to stand up and tell 
my pupils that honesty is a good thing, or that 
virtue is a good thing. I do want an opportunity 
to let those students see that I am a square man, 
that I do not deceive, that my word is good, that 
what I am to-day I will be tomorrow. That is the 
opportunity for the teacher — to lead a true, square 
life before the student. I do not care for any 
opportunity to talk " goody " to a student. My last 
word is that when we shall simply keep school as 
school ought to be kept, we shall be giving the best 
moral instruction possible.' 

To this general trend of the discussion, there 
were, of course, some voices raised in dissent, 
and some outbursts of bigotry. One speaker 
said that ' only persons who reverence God and 
show that reverence in their lives should be 
appointed to any teaching position.' He then 
went on to say that he was broad-minded 
enough to approve of Catholics, Protestants, 
and Jews, an admission which elicited from 
one of the following speakers an energetic pro- 
test against the fitness of a Jew to be a school- 
teacher in a ' Christian nation.' But these 
exhibitions, lamentable as they are, do not 
detract very much from the value of the dis- 
cussion, which, as a whole, took the right direc- 
tion and reached the right conclusions. 

The ' serious defects in our high school sys- 



tem ' which came up for consideration in the 
closing hours of the conference proved to be 
the too great preponderance of woman teachers 
in our schools, a fact so evident that it hardly 
needs to be emphasized; the ways in which 
social life and unfortunate home conditions 
interfere with serious study, ways which we all 
know to be perplexingly nimierous ; and the bad 
influence of school societies, which is probably 
far from being as bad as it is made out to be. 
Under the chapter of ' defects,' many other 
matters might have been brought forward, and 
some of more consequence than those touched 
upon. There happens to lie before us at this 
moment the report of one of the members of the 
Mosely Commission, and we read in it these 
words : ' Unless the Americans desire to stereo- 
type all teaching, they must be prepared to 
grant almost absolute freedom to their teachers.' 
Here is a glance at a defect of our system far 
more radical than any that came up in the con- 
ference at Evanston. We offer the suggestion 
merely to indicate a better use that might have 
been made of that closing hour, since the immi- 
nent close of our remarks makes impossible any 
discussion of so vastly important a subject. 

It is appropriate to add, after this summary 
of one of the most valuable educational docu- 
ments of recent years, that the occasion of the 
conference whose proceedings are now pub- 
lished was the completion by Dr. Herbert 
Franklin Fisk of thirty years of service as prin- 
cipal of the N'orthwestern University Academy. 
The work thus becomes, not only an important 
contribution to current educaitional thought, but 
also a deserved personal tribute to a man whose 
lifelong devotion to the work of secondary 
teaching has been to an unusual degree fruitful 
and inspiring. 



LITTERA SCRIPT A. 



Littera scripta manet might serve as text for 
many a discourse on the terrible inexorability 
of the past — past deeds, past words, past 
thoughts even, which no utmost urgency of 
prayerful entreaty or unstinted flow of repent- 
ant tears can recall or annul. The endless agony 
of unavailing remorse that may follow a momen- 
tary act of innocent or even virtuous intent is 
one of those things that, like the mystery of 
sin to which it is in fact closely allied, perplex 
and baffle us the more we grope for an explana- 
tion and seek to apply a remedy. Without 
dwelling, however, on the graver applications of 
this pithy proverb, it is proposed here to adduce 
some of the less harrowing, but perhaps not 
less instructive, while certainly more amusing, 
illustrations of its truth as found in the pitiless 
permanence of the written, or rather the printed,

"vyord, — its obstinate and often highly vexa- 
tious refusal to be expunged or forgotten. Other 
matters suggested by this tyranny of the letter 
may also find appropriate mention before we 
close. 

It is now nearer three hundred than two 
hundred years ago that the reading world of 
England, and more especially of London, was 
witness to a rather heated theologica.1 dispute 
known in ecclesiastical (and literary history as 
the Smectymnuan controversy. In March, 1641, 
Bishop Hall published his ' Humble Eemon- 
strance' in defense of Episcopacy against the 
onslaughts of dissenters. To this there 
appeared, two months later, an answer written 
by ten anti-Episcopalians, who signed them- 
selves collectively * Smectymnuus/ from the 
initial letters of their names, the uii standing 
for w. These collaborating pamphleteers, with 
all their pride of learning and imposing array 
of argument and citation of authorities, bad in 
an unguarded moment been guilty of what to a 
classical scholar was an unpardonable absurdity, 
in referring to the judges on Mars' Hill as 
' Areopagi.' In an age when Latin was the 
common medium for learned works, and was 
not uncommon even as a spoken language, this 
error could not fail to evoke the enemy's 
derision. Very soon Hall was out with a rejoin- 
der, in which he failed not to pounce upon the 
unlucky ' Areopagi.' ' Who were these ? ' he 
asks. ' Truly, my masters, I had thought this 
had been the name of the place, not the men.' 
Then the Smectymnuans, squirming uneasily 
under this, and their scholarship smarting with 
wounded pride, appeared with a ' Vindication 
of the Answer to the Humble Remonstrance,' 
in which they feebly attempted to make light 
of their blunder. Does the Bishop really 
imagine, they ask, that they were so ignorant 
as not to know that the more correct word would 
have been ' Areopagitae,' though * Areopagi' 
might very well be used for shortness? And is 
the Humble Remonstrant himself so free from 
verbal slips that he can afford to make merr}' 
over so small a matter? What a specimen of 
slipshod English is this, for example, in his 
own late performance, — ' These other verbal 
exceptions are but light froth and will sink 
alone ' ! The scornful Remonstrant's ' light 
froth sinking alone ' is as delicious a blunder 
any day as their own unoffending ' Areopiagi.' 
The Humble Remonstrant is further importuned 
by one of his readers, ' a gentleman student in 
Philosophy,' to publish his receipt for making 
light froth sink alone, ' that it may be added 
to the Secrets of Alexis or the rare experiments 
of Baptista Porta.' 

So much for the amenities of pamphlet con- 
troversy over verbal slips among scholars to 



whom conviction of a false quantity, or other 
reflection on their latinity, was a rankling 
wound and a festering sore. Another literary 
dispute of the same period illustrates amusingly 
the awful certainty that a man's sin will find 
him out. In the very act of trying to deny the 
authorship of the written word, he often blun- 
ders into an unconscious confession of guilt. 
Much printer's ink was shed, soon after the 
beheading of Charles I., in a dispute as to the 
authorship of the ' Regii Sanguinis Clamor ad 
Ccelum ' an anti-regicide work that made no 
little stir at the time of its appearance. One 
Alexander More (or Morus, as he was ordinarily 
styled) had been charged with the authorship, 
and had been rebuked for his unfeeling refer- 
ence, in the ' Dedicatory Epistle,' to Milton's 
blindness. In this epistle the Latin Secretary 
had been taunted Avith his affliction as a just 
punishment for siding with the regicides, and 
the familiar Virgilian line had been applied to 
him, — 

" Monstrum horrendum, informe, ingens, cui lumen 
ademptum." 

Vehemently did Moras protest, in his ' Fides 
Publica,' that he hfid had nothing to do with the 
' Regii Sanguinis Clamor,' and that therefore 
he could not have been guilt}' of the heartless 
allusion referred to. Then he added, with most 
delightful self -betrayal, * If anything occurred 
to me that might seem to look that way, I 
referred to the mind.' We now know that the 
book thus unwelcomely fathered on Morus was, 
with the exception of the 'Dedicatory Epistle,' 
the work of tJie Rev. Peter du Moulin, who was 
suitably rewarded therefor by Charles II. But 
the dedication and the editorship of the whole 
book remain charged to the account of Moras, 
who stands convicted out of his own ink-bottle. 
Time turns not back, neither do the presses 
of the printer. Many an author has repented 
of his earlier volumes jmd sought in vain to 
suppress them. Edward FitzGerald made the 
unwise and fortunately unsuccessful attempt to 
recall and suppress his little book of plays from 
the Spanish of Calderon, because some stickler 
for literal accuracy, reviewing the volume in a 
prominent journal, had found fault with its 
frankly avowed freedom of rendering. But the 
real poetry in the performance triumphed over 
the finical objections of the pedantic and undis- 
cerning critic, and the plays have taken their 
deserved place in English literature. Bitterly 
did the creator of Harold Skimpole regret hav- 
ing thus held Leigh Hunt up to ridicule; but 
no expressions of remorse, no penance of self- 
castigation, would un-write the written word, 
Happy he who looks not back on indiscretions 
of this nature, or worse, only to feel the remorse- 
lessness of the types.

THE DIAL,

As a man's speech bewrayeth him, so the 
written utterance, even if it be but a word, or 
in some instances hardly more than a letter, 
is significant of thought and character. In 
a recent excellent work on ' Culture and 
Restraint,' which balances the conflicting claims 
of Hellenism and Hebraism, one little word, a 
mere auxiliary to the verb, betnays better than 
pages of argument the author's bias in this dis- 
cussion. With an unconscious but highly sig- 
nificant disregard of perfection of form, he 
writes : ' If we could lay bare all the mental 
processes, by which we come to a decision or 
express a preference, we would be surprised how 
little reason enters into it.' Obviously, neither 
in this nor in any other case is surprise a volun- 
tary movement of the mind, and what the 
author meant is that we should be surprised; 
but his sense of tlie niceties of accurate expres- 
sion, — a sense perhaps associated in his mind 
with that excessive Hellenism he deprecates, — 
is a little dull. Hence his involuntary betrayal 
of his ' preference.' Again, referring to the 
novel descriptive of slum life, but based on 
theory rather than on experience, he says : ' We 
will get more true knowledge of the problem 
from the humble city missionary or the sister 
of mercy.' Here too it is plain that he has in 
mind no prospective exertion of will power, but 
a mere necessary result of antecedent conditions. 
This is of course a small matter, microscop- 
ically small if you choose, but it illustrates how 
one unconsciously illuminative word or phrase 
may stamp an author for us better than whole 
pages of description. Mr. Black wantons so 
systematically and outrageously in the misuse 
of ' will ' and ' Avould ' that the temptation to 
draw an illustration from his book was irresist- 
ible. 

Misery loves compiany. Those that have blun- 
dered (and who has not?) derive a certain 
solace from the contemplation of others' blun- 
ders that must have caused their perpetrators 
many an uncomfortable quarter of an hour. In 
his edition of Shakespeare Pope has a note to 
* Measure for Measure,' to the effect that its 
plot was taken from Cinthio's Novels, Dec. 8, 
Nov. 5; that is Decade 8, Novel 5. The critical 
Warburton in his edition fills out the abbrevia- 
tions thus, — December 8, November 5. St. 
Ursula's attendant train of eleven thouvsnnd vir- 
gins was, it is now thought, all created out of 
a misinterpretation of a written word. In some 
ancient manuscript was found mention of ' St. 
Ursula et Undecimilla V. M.,' which being 
interpreted is nothing more than ' St. Ursula 
and Undecimilla, virgin martyrs.' But the 
accepted version came to be ' St. Ursula and 
eleven thousand virgin martyrs,' the decipherer 
mistaking Undecimilla for undecem millia. In 



the first edition of John Britton's ' Descriptive 
Sketches of Tunbridge Wells ' is found the fol- 
lowing amazing reference to Bloody Jeffreys: 
' Judge Jefferies, a man who has rendered his 
name infamous in the annals of history by the 
cruelty and injustice he manifested in presiding 
at the trial of King Charles I.' Mr. Gladstone, 
ill his ' Gleanings of Past Years,' relied with a 
too careless confidence on his knowledge of the 
Bible when he wrote : ' The fierce light that 
beats upon a throne is sometimes like the heat 
of that furnace in which only Daniel could walk 
unscathed, too fierce for those whose place it is 
to stand in its vicinity.' One may trust that 
ere this the author has made his peace with 
Shadrach, Mesh'ach, and Abednego, for the 
slight thus unconsciously put upon them. 
Truly, these items are pleasant reading to him 
that is wont to take comfort in Homer's occa- 
sional nodding. 

The subject of misprints would furnish an 
amusing chapter illustrative of our text. The 
first list of eiTata in a printed book is slaid to be 
found in an edition of Juvenal, with notes by 
Merula, printed by Gabriel Pierre at Venice in 
1478. Before that date errors had been cor- 
rected with the pen. The longest list of errata 
on record appears to be that appended to the 
works of Picus of Mirandula, printed by Knob- 
lauch at Strasburg in 1507. It fills fifteen folio 
pages. Some of the apologies offered by 
printers for their blunders are quaint and even 
pathetic. They date back, needless to say, before 
tiiese artisans had become hardened in their 
sins. 

' Good reader,' pleads the French printer of 
an English book, in 1582, ' pardon all fiaultes 
escaped in the printing and beare with the 
woorkmanship of a strainger.' Another early- 
printed book begins its note on the errata with 
the sage remark, ' humanum est errare, — to 
confirm which position this my booke (as many 
other are) hath his share of errors ; ' and the 
note runs on in a sprightly and amusing vein 
of self -justification for faults of omission and 
commission. But the history of typographical 
blunders would form a very bulky volume in 
that ' History of Human Error ' which Augus- 
tine Caxton so elaborately planned, but never 
carried further than the printing of the first 
seven sheets by Uncle Jack's Grand Anti-Pub- 
lisher Confederate Authors' Society, ' with sun- 
dry unfinished plates depicting the various 
developments of the human skull (that temple 
of Human Error).' These desultory para- 
graphs, likewise, must suffice for the present 
as a slight contribution, and by no means a 
learned or original one, to that unfinished and, 
from its very nature, never-to-be-finished ' His- 
torv of Human Error.' Percy F. Bicknell.

A Study of Adolescence.* 



In two substantial, almost monumental vol- 
umes, with the general title of ' Adolescence/ 
President G. Stanley Hall has brought together 
the fruits of the activity of liis vigorous group 
of disciples at Clark University, in a form which 
will deservedly take rank as the authoritative 
treatment of a great theme. The exhaustive 
body of material which it represents would in 
itself be enough to win a secure place for the 
book. But President Hall also has had peculiar 
success in welding this somewhat discouraging 
mass of facts into a whole, which leaves on the 
mind a remarkably distinct impression. The 
picture of adolescence, — the * yeasty stage of 
intense emotions and narrow mentality', when 
the flood-gates of heredity are opened, and new 
interests and passions jostle one another in a 
wild disorder, a stage with all the attractiveness 
and all the vagaries of incipient genius, which 
is, indeed, but the ' apotheosis of adolescence ', 
an adolescence intensified and prolonged, — 
stands out in a vivid way. All the characteris- 
tic features of youth, — its egoism and variable- 
ness of mood, its fondness for assuming roles 
and poses, its hero-worship, its intense desire to 
feel and to be very much alive, its proclivity to 
superlatives, to high and lurid color, its silli- 
nesses and enthusiasms and heroisms, — are 
treated in a way which is at times highly enter- 
taining, and which makes many a familiar fact 
stand out in a new and significant light. And 
back of all there stands the one essential fact of 
Sex, and of Love. From one point of view, the 
book as a whole might almost be described as a 
commentary on the Symposium of Plato. It is 
love which constitutes the central and signifi- 
cant fact of this, the most significant of all the 
periods of life. Out of it spring, by a process 
of ' long circuiting', all the main aspects of the 
life of spirit, — art, religion, the social self ; 
and in his treatment of this theme the author 
grows occasionally almost dithyrambic. Even 
knowledge at its best is but another form of 
Eros. The thesis may or may not be regarded 
as proved. The relation of the higher aspects 
of love to the physical fact of sex is indeed left 
somewhat obscure ; and not every reader will be 
reconciled, even by the author's eloquence, to 
the conception of goodness, truth, and beauty

Physiology, Anthropology, Sociology, Sex, Crime, Religion, 
and Education. By G. Stanley Hall, Ph.D., LL.D. In

as a ' transcendental phallacism.' But at any 
rate the treatment lends to the work in parts^ 
especially in the second volume, a larger inter- 
est than usually belongs to sc-ientific or peda- 
gogical writings, — an interest which the arid 
statistics of the earlier chapters might perhaps 
lead the general reader to miss, by discouraging 
him too easily. As a whole, the book has a real 
measure of literary effectiveness ; and in view of 
this one may regret, in passing, the tendency to 
a rather barbarous special terminology, which 
at times spoils the author's ordinarily lucid and 
vigorous style. 

From the reviewer's stlandpoint, the book is 
discouraging by reason of the wealth of its sub- 
ject-matter. To take it in the large, the earlier 
chapters deal with the various physical char- 
acteristics of adolescence, culminating in tihe 
facts of sexual development. Following these 
there is an interesting, though rather miscel- 
laneous, chapter on ' Adolescence m Literature 
and Biography,' in which Plato and the Catho- 
lic Saints, Savonarola and Edison, Goethe, and 
Mary MacLane, and a host of others, are some- 
what promiscuously intermingled. After an- 
other introductory chapter on ' Feelings and 
Psychic Development,' in which is contained an 
outline of the author's general philosophic 
faith. Adolescent Love is discussed, and this is 
followed by chapters on the various other 
aspects of the psychical life, — nature-feeling, 
religion, social instincts, and intellectual devel- 
opment. 

Of the multiplicity of special discussions, the 
most interesting are those in which President 
Hall sets forth the educational implications of 
his facts. In these his own main interest is 
centered. Regarding education as man's chief 
nroblem, and youth as the golden age of life 
and its chief danger-point on the proper under- 
standing and training of which depends all the 
possibilities of the race, he brings to the theme 
an enthusiasm; which is infectious. President 
Hall's educational views are well known; but 
they are expressed here so incisively, and receive 
such an added weight from the solid back- 
ground of fact in which they are set, that they 
have something of a new value. One need not 
agree with all the doctrines expressed to recog- 
nize their importance as a contribution to edxi- 
cational theory, — an importance due primarily 
to this close connection with the facts of Iwy 
and girl nature. 

Not much can be done here beyond a mere 
reference to some of the points which are of 
more general interest. It would be difficult to 
find a more satisfactory discussion in brief of 



1904.]

the physical side of education than that in the 
chapter on ' Motor Function.' The vast impor- 
tance of the subject, especially in view of the 
great changes in the motor habits of modern 
man, is not overemphasized ; but the treatment 
shows a sanity, and a realization of the com- 
plexity of the problem, which is not always 
found. The criticism of the shortcomings of 
our present rather one-sided ideals of physical 
education is clear hnd pertinent, — the inade- 
quate provision for industrial training on its 
liberal side; the woodenness and narrowness of 
manual-training courses, in which in particular 
the fatal mistake has been made of ' cutting 
industry loose from its product, as if it were a 
contamination'; the failure to bring suf- 
ficiently to bear idealistic and enthusiastic 
motives such as are found in the ' gospellers of 
work,' headed by Ruskin and Morris; the 
divorcing of gymnastics from a broad genetic 
point of view; and the various dangers of ath- 
letics. Equally judicious is the treatment, on 
the practical side, of the difficult subject of 
sexual development and its perversions. 

The chapter on Juvenile Delinquency is more 
scattering, but contains a good deal of valuable 
matter. The statement that adolescence is the 
best key to the nature of crime represents the 
standpoint of the chapter. The naturalness, 
from the point of view of adolescence, of both 
the less serious and the more serious phenomena 
of juvenile perversion, and the impossibility of 
treating these adequately when they are looked 
at in an isolated way apart from their basis in 
real demands of the boy's life, are brought out 
in a convincing manner. The discussion of 
nature-feeling, again, gives opportunity for a 
criticism of the modem pedagogy- of science in 
the schools, and a plea for less thoroughness and 
precision, more emotional responses of a funda^ 
mental sort, and a greater recognition of utili- 
tarian values. Another interesting chapter is 
the one on the ' Adolescent Psychology of Con- 
version.' President Hall was the pioneer in 
the field of study of conversion in connection 
with adolescence, and he has something fresh to 
say even in view of the rapidly increasing litera- 
ture of the subject, from Starbuck to Professor 
James (whose recent book is characterized as the 
yellow literature of religious psychology). 
Another good discussion of practical value is 
that which deals with adolescent societies. The 
strictures upon some of the tendencies found in 
the Y. P. S. C. E., and similar organizations, 
deserve to be read by all religious leaders. 

Less easy to sum up, but equally worthy of 
consideration, is the treatment of education and 
intellectual development. In general, our prev- 



alent methods are held to show scant knowledge 
of adolescent psychology, and to neglect nearly 
all the suggestions offered by the natural 
demands of youth. Instead of the strenuous 
and highly intellectual ized programme of the 
present-day secondary school, with its examina- 
tions and rigid requirements, its insistence upon 
form ratlier than content, and upon elements 
instead of large living wholes, ' youth needs 
repose, leisure, art, legends, romance, idealiza- 
tion, in a word humanism.' * The educational 
ideal is to develop capacity in as many direc- 
tions as possible, to indulge caprice and velleity 
a little, to delay consistency for a time, and let 
the diverse prepotencies struggle with each 
other.' President Hall has a standing quarrel 
with educational committees and most of their 
working principles, and with the whole attempt 
to regulate the high-school on the part of the 
college. His conception of the education of 
women brings him into still sharper opposition 
to prevailing tendencies. It emphasizes the 
differences of sex as essential, and, in place of 
foisting upon women ' the old college training 
which has proved unfit for men,' calls for an 
elaborate reconstruction of women's education, 
which shall both recognize the claims of her 
physical limitations first of all, and shall frankly 
look toward maternity as the normal end of her 
being. On account of the difference of her 
needs and interests, combined with other rea- 
sons, coeducation in the high-school period is 
deprecated; and a strong protest is entered 
against the progressive feminization of second- 
ary education. The characterization of the dif- 
ferences between the two sexes is interesting, 
and the whole argument is one to be taken 
into serious account, though it is hardly likely 
that it has given the final word on the subject. 

Especially timely is the closing chapter on 
' Adolescent Races and their Treatment.' This 
is a real contribution to the insistent problem 
of imperialism; the carrying over of the con- 
cept of adolescence to immature and uncivilized 
races proves really enlightening. The chapter 
shows effectively how false, psychologically, 
has been our whole policy of attempting to make 
over off-hand races with alien methods of 
thought and feeling into our own likeness, 
instead of patiently studying them and helping 
them develop the possibilities of their own 
genius; while the puncturing of the naive 
assumption that all of good is contained in our 
own civilization, and the justification of poten- 
cies in less developed races which would, if 
allowed to mature, add elements of real value to 
our own life, is a good piece of argument. 

Alike, then, for its exhaustive collection of

[Aagust 16, 



facts about adolescence, and for its deductions 
from these in the reahn of practical and educa- 
tional doctrine, the book is of serious and per- 
manent value. It is, however, ambitious to be 
considerably more than this; and about this 
further claim there may be some difference of 
opinion. For President Hall puts forth the 
book as an essay in a new and epoch-making 
philosophy, opposed to dominant tendencies, 
for which, as academic, ' epistemological,' and 
anti-evolutionary, h.e has nothing but con- 
demnation. The epistemologists, however, will 
probably not be convinced that he has succeeded, 
after all, in striking out any very new and 
exclusive way. President Hall's own interests 
are concrete and scientific, and for this his book 
is of course none the worse. But it is not 
uncommon for lovers of concrete fact to decry 
as useless and academic the less attractive work 
of a philosophical criticism of categories; and 
of this somewhat short-sighted tendency Presi- 
dent Hall is not wholly guiltless. It might be 
expected, therefore, that his own attempts at a 
positive and constructive statement would lay 
themselves open to criticism for a certain lack 
of rigor, both in method and result. As for 
method, the chief plea would seem to be for 
the precedence of carefully collected fact over 
theory; i. e., when interpreted, for the relative 
unimportance of an introspective study of the 
adult' consciousness, and of philosophies based 
upon this, as compared with the wider observa- 
tional method, exemplified, e. g., in the ques- 
tionnaire, and applied to children, savages and 
animals. Abstractly, of course, the first point 
is undeniable; but one cannot help thinking 
that the author exaggerates both the dearth of 
valuable fact among the ' introspective ' psy- 
chologists, and the importance and novelty of 
the results of his own method. Tliere is no need 
at all to deny that the work of the Clark school 
has brought out a great deal that is interesting 
and valuable, especially in view of the evidence 
afforded by the present volume. That it has 
shown some leaning to the elaboration of com- 
monplaces, and to the mistaken notion that fig- 
uring averages constitutes scientific method, 
cannot altogether be overlooked. Still, even 
such a statement, for example, as that so many 
youths and maidens out of a hundred ' confess 
that the sight of the moon makes them want to 
see their beau or girl,' easy as it might be to 
hold it up to ridicule, may be given a signifi- 
cance, as President Hall has shown. But with- 
out at all questioning the value of the work, it 
may nevertheless be doubted whether it really 
has the relative importance claimed for it, and 
whether, in particular, it is sufficient to serve as 
the basis of a new philosophy. It is hardly pos- 
sible in a few lines to sift out the various 
motives which enter into the view of the world 



to which, in President Hall's opinion, his facts 
are to lead. In part they are undoubtedly true. 
But here he does somewhat less than justice to 
his opponents, who often would have no quarrel 
with him. For the rest, it is perhaps enough 
to mention what seem to be the most distinctive 
points of his doctrine. First, there is the in- 
sistence that the psychical life is to be inter- 
preted as a recapitulation of and a witness to 
a multiplicity of paSt racial experiences, and is 
to be known by tracing out all the obscure roots 
and branches of the buried tree of its pedigree. 
This of course, again, would be generally recog- 
nized as true within certain limits; and Presi- 
dent Hall has applied it in detail in a way that 
is always interesting, and at times carries con- 
viction. That our love of natural objects is a 
trace of primitive idolatries; that the blush at 
compliments is the vasomotor survival of a state 
when to be admired meant danger; that the 
approximate adjustment of the child to his 
environment, from nine to twelve, represents an 
old and relatively perfected state of race matur- 
ity, possible in warm climates ; that the delight 
in bonfires is a reverberation of the joy that in 
some prehistoric time hailed the Prometheus 
art of controlling fire and defyin? night; that 
truancy is the gift of an early nomadic culture, 

— these and numerous other suggestions are 
scattered through his pages, some of them more, 
some of them decidedly less, convincing. One 
of the most elaborate is the detailed discussion 
in the chapter on nature-feeling, in which the 
instinctive fear of thunder and lightning, of 
serpents, of high winds, of falling, and of water, 
tlie habit of inducing sleep by rocking, agoro- 
phobia, and the climbing instinct, are cited as 
relics of a primitive arboreal life. But to recog- 
nize the legitimacy of such an explanation does 
not bind one to accept the conclusions that are 
drawn from it, ^ to look upon it as the deepest 
and exclusive truth of the life of spirit, and to 
minimize the significance of the developed con- 
sciousness; and in doing this the author lays 
himself open to serious objections, alike from 
the theoretical standpoint and from that of a 
practical philosophy of life, of which he shows 
no appreciation. Still more vague, and in need 
of a critical clearing up, is the final outlook 
upon the world of spirit to which all this leads, 

— the conception of a collective soul, which is 
itself visible nature, a ' sensorium of wondrous 
subtlety that reflects in its multipersonal facets 
most that has been in the world.' The conscious 
adult is a ' maimed fragment broken off and 
detached from the great world of soul'; ^his 
fuller consciousness is a ' late, partial, and per- 
haps essentially abnormal and remedial outcrop 
of the great underlying life of man-soul,' a 
' wart raised by the sting of sin.' ' Is not this an 
instance of just the fanciful, barren use of

ment from Descartes to Hegel, if he had taken 
it more seriously, and not as a mere pathological 
warning, might have saved him ?

A Documentary History of Columbus.* 

Mr. John Boyd Thacher has given us a new 
study of Columbus in three large volumes. The 
work is an examination of the problems pre- 
sented by the life of the discoverer, rather than 
a formal biography. The first and second 
volumes cover the period of his life, and present 
in order biographical essays on Peter Martyr 
and Las Casas as the first historians of America, 
an introductory discussion of the character and 
aims of Columbus, the story of his early life 
and the formation of his purpose, a study of 
Toscanelli and an examination of the pilot 
story, the details of the first voyage, the an- 
nouncement of the discovery, the papal bulls 
and line of demarcation, and an account of the 
later voyages. The third volume is devoted to 
supplementary matters: a classification of the 
alleged portraits, a study of the handwriting of 
Colnmbus, an elaborate investigation in twenty 
chapters of the location of his remains, and a 
brief account of his descendants. 

The most conspicuous and at the same time 
the most useful feature of the work is the 
reproduction and ciareful English translation of 
the more important sources of information. 
The purpose set forth in the preface is to pre- 
sent to the reader all the information about 
Columbus available in the sixteenth century, 
and to add such as has since come to light. A 
considerable part of this material is given in 
facsimile. The facsimiles include the relevant 
passages in Peter Martyr's Epistles ; the unique 
examples of both the folio and quarto editions 
of the letter to Santangel; the papal bulls, as 
copied in the Vatican Register; the Coma- 
Syllacius letter; the unique examples of the 
famous Libretto and of the equally famous 
Lettera, and all known documents in the hand- 
writing of Columbus. Besides the facsimiles, 
there are reprints of the lives of Gallo and 
Senarega, Giustiniano's note in the Polyglot 
Psalter, the Journal of the first voyage, the 
Chanca narrative of the second voyage, the let- 
ter to the Nurse and I^as Casas's narrative of 
the third voyage, and the Porras and Mendez 
narratives of the fourth voyage. A great deal 
of bibliographical material is given with a view

Remains. By John Boyd Thacher. In three volumes.

of making the work useful to the collector of 
rare Americana. It would have been an excel- 
lent arrangement if the source material had 
been put together in a separate volume sep- 
arately obtainable. 

The reader approaches Mr. Thacher's own 
text with some misgiving. This feeling is trace- 
able to two causes. In the first place, Mr. 
Thacher very clearly undertakes the work for 
the purpose of rehabilitating the memory of 
Columbus and defending him from the harsh 
strictures of recent critics. In the introductory 
chapter he lays down the thesis that Colum- 
bus was one of the greatest characters in 
the world's history, and then devotes the 
remainder of the work to its proof. This gives 
the book the air of a special plea rather than 
that of an investigation for the discovery of 
truth. There seem to be two veins running 
through the whole. One is written in the spirit 
of historical research, and the other is extrava- 
gant panegyric unwarranted by the facts pre- 
sented. The frontispiece of the first volume is 
a fine etching, based upon the Marine portrait, 
which Mr. Thacher labels ' an imaginative but 
satisfactory portrait of Columbus.' It is diffi- 
cult to escape the feeling that Mr. Thacher is 
endeavoring to draw ' an imaginative but satis- 
factory ' pen-picture, and thJat his Judgment at 
critical points is likely to be warped by his 
partiality for his subject. 

The second ground for distrust of Mr. 
Thacher's work arises from his failure to indi- 
cate the source of much of his material and to 
give credit to the work of other scholars. 
Although he dedicates his volumes to Mr. Har- 
risse, and refers to him frequently in his pages, 
the extent of his indebtedness is hardly appar- 
ent. There is an interesting chapter on Ferdi- 
nand Columbus and his library, but Mr. Har- 
ri&se's ' Excerpta Colombiniana ' is not credited 
as its source of inspiration. All of tlie documents 
printed by Mr. Thacher, with the possible excep- 
tion of a few of the Columbus manuscripts, have 
appeared in Navarrete or the Raccolta Colom- 
biana, but the fact could not be gathered from 
his pages. The source of the Porras and Mendez 
narratives, taken from Navarrete, is not indi- 
cated, and an account of the Raccolta is rele- 
gated to the index. Of the Libretto he strangely 
says that ' probably its pages have never been 
closely examined until they looked into the 
camera to be reproduced for this work,' but, 
although not photographed, the Libretto was 
transcribed and must have been closely exam- 
ined for the Raccolta. Pennesi is not cited in 
the chapters on Peter Martyr, and Uzielli only 
incidentally in those on Toscanelli. Cronau's 
name appears but once in the discussion about 
the remains of Columbus, and the source of Mr.

THE DIAL. 



[August 16, 



Thacher's information upon the subject is not 
indicated. The only English translation for 
which credit is given is the translation of the 
Coma-Syllflcius letter printed by Mr. Lennox. 
Kettel's is said to be the only English rendering 
of the Journal, though it seems that Markham's 
would have been consulted. With an air of 
novelty, Mr. Thacher points to the reference to 
the Great Khan, in the prologue to the Journal 
and in the ' Lettera,' as a reference by Colum- 
bus to Toscanelli's letter, although this was a 
part of Humboldt's original argument, and Mr. 
Vignaud has already shown that Columbus 
might have derived his information from Marco 
Polo, and that the reference tells quite as 
strongly in favor of the fabrication of the letter 
as it does in favor of its genuineness. Under 
these circumstances, the reader is unable to dis- 
tinguish between Mr. Thacher's own conclusions 
and those he has adopted from others. The 
Columbus material is so extensive and so intri- 
cate that the writer who attempts to deal with 
it should make the frankest possible statement 
of his sources and of his mental processes. 
Candor inspires confidence. Mr. Thacher's 
omissions in this direction impair confidence. 

The arrangement of this complicated material 
is a difficult problem, which Mr. Thacher has 
not solved with complete success. The Tos- 
canelli discussion is divided between the first 
and the third volumes, and scattered through 
the notes in all three. Much important matter 
given in notes should have been embodied in 
the text, — as, for example, the hypothesis to 
explain the inaccuracies of the Latin copy of 
the Toscanelli letter. Doubtless the scattering 
of the Toscanelli matter results from the addi- 
tion of much of it since the appearance of Mr. 
Vignaud's book. Other material is, however, 
scattered in the same way. With a section 
devoted to Las Casas, one naturally looks to it 
for an account of the manuscripts of the ' His- 
toria,' but it is not given until the authorities 
for the third voyage are discussed. The chap- 
ter on Ferdinand's library breaks into the 
middle of the examination of Columbus's hand- 
writing. The chapter on the voyage to Iceland 
closes with the quotation from Ferdinand, with 
which it should have begun. The clearness and 
force of the entire work would have been greatly 
increased by a better arrangement of the subject 
matter. 

Mr. Thacher's conclusions upon controverted 
questions of fact may be briefly summarized. 
He regards the ' Historic ' as substantially the 
work of Ferdinand; he places the birth-date of 
Columbus at 1446, upon the basis of Columbus's 
own statements as to the length of various 
periods in his life; he accepts the doubtful 
story of the voyage to Iceland, and incidentally 



the still more doubtful one of the Zeni ; he con- 
nects the wife of Columbus remotely with the 
family of Perestrello, and apparently accepts 
the supposed residence at Porto Santo; he 
places the landfall at Watling's island, credit* 
the alleged first voyage of Yespucius, regards 
the remains at San Domingo as undoubtedly 
the true remains of the discoverer, and con- 
cludes that there is no authentic portrait of 
Columbus in existence. 

From the fact that this is the first life of 
Columbus to appear since the publication of 
Mr. Vignaud's book, interest naturally attaches 
to the treatment of the Toscanelli letter. As 
set forth by Mr. Vignaud, the discussion turns 
upon two distinct points, — first, the pilot story, 
set up as a motive for fabricating the letter; 
and, second, the claim that the letter is not gen- 
uine. With regard to the first point, Mr. 
Thacher shows very efi'ectively that the pilot 
story is both improbable and unsupported by 
contemporary evidence. He makes the plausible 
suggestion that the story originated in the state- 
ment of Columbus's Journal that the report of 
land to the westward was current in the 
Canaries and Azores, and that a man from the 
Madeira Islands besought the King of Portugal 
in 1584 for a caravel in order to go to it. It 
is just such a story as Columbus's enemies 
would have invented in order to undermine and 
discredit him. If anything could have been 
made out of it, it would have been used in the 
inquiry brought in 1513 against Ferdinand 
Columbus to test his rights and privileges. 
With the rejection of the pilot story, there is no 
adequate motive for the fabrication of the letter. 
With regard to the letter itself, it is too early 
in the controversy to attempt to pronounce 
judgment. Mr. Thacher contends that the Latin 
copy is in the handwriting of Columbus, and his 
study of the characteristics of Columbus's hand- 
writing is so careful and painstaking that his 
opinion upon this point carries great weight. 
If this be true, then the letter, if not genuine, 
was forged by Columbus himself. There is one 
explanation of Columbus's silence with respect 
to the letter, which seems not to have been 
noticed. By basing his applications for assist- 
ance upon the letter, he would have deprived 
himself of the credit of initiating the plan of 
reaching the Indies by a westward route, and 
would have diminished the rewards he could 
demand for its successful achievement. To base 
his plan upon the opinions of ancient geogra- 
phers and the reports of medianlal travellers was 
very different in effect from an appeal to the 
authority of a man who was living when the 
efforts to secure assistance were begun, and who 
had been dead but ten years when the discovery 
was finally accomplished. The distinguished

scientist would immediately have been hailed as 
the real discoverer of America, and the unknown 
adventurer would have been regarded as his 
humble agent. This consideration seems suffi- 
cient to explain one of the principal objections 
urged against the authenticity of the Tosc-anelli 
letter. As the matter now stands, there still 
seems insufficient reason for doubting the opin- 
ion of Las Casas that the letter was genuine, or 
for charging him with complicity in deception. 

In discussing the character of Columbus, Mr. 
Thacher excuses his unfaithfulness in his family 
life by the lax morals of the age, and pleads the 
holy object for which he wished to acquire 
wealth in extenuation of his avarice. He meets 
the charge of initiating Indian slavery with the 
claim that Columbus intended to confine sla- 
very to the cannibals who preyed upon the other 
tribes. He shows that the oath that Cuba was 
a continent, imposed upon the masters and sail- 
ors during the second voyage, was the work of 
the notary and not required by the instructions 
of Columbus. He, however, charges Columbus 
with untruthfulness in writing to the sov- 
ereigns, upon his last voyage, that he had 
reached the ' province of Mango, which borders 
upon Cathay,' since Mr. Thacher believes that 
Columbus at this time realized that he had 
found a new world, and wrote this statement in 
order to deceive the pilots who might try to 
profit by his discoveries. Mr. Harrisse has 
shown that the opinion prevailed as early as 
1501 that a new continent had been discovered. 
Columbus's life and success were so completely 
bound up in reaching Asia that it was natural 
for him to cling to his first impression that he 
had done so. It therefore seems more reasona- 
ble to regard as sincere his statement that he 
had reached Mango and the borders of Cathay. 
It was distinctly more creditable to him to cling 
honestly to error than to misrepresent his real 
opinion. 

While there is some fault to be found with 
Mr. Thacher's method, and necessarily some 
difference of opinion with respect to his conclu- 
sions, his work is nevertheless an immense store- 
house of material and a distinct addition to the 
literature of American history. The index, 
while apparently full, is far from serving as a 
guide to all the matter contained in the text 
and notes. The volumes are beautifully printed, 
beautifully illustrated, and remarkably free 
from typographical errors. There is a con- 
spicuous lack of maps; the only one illustrating 
the voyages is a photographic reproduction of a 
German canal map upon which the names are 
wholly illegible. The work affords occasional 
glimpses of the author's splendid collection of 
Americana. In the second volume he says that 
his efforts to secure the privilege of examining, 
in the interest of historical inquiry, the original 



manuscript of the Libretto have been unsuccess- 
ful ; but a note in the index conveys the satisfy- 
ing information that it is now in his possession. 
An account of the acquisition of his treasures 
would make an interesting story.

Books about Dante.* 



The third series of Dr. Edward Moore's 
' Studies in Dante ' gives us a group, of five 
essays, only two of which have been previously 
published, even in part. The first of these essays, 
on ' The Astronomy of Dante,' is designed for 
students ' who may not wish to embark on the 
subject of the study of Astronomy generally,' 
yet who wish to understand the many passages 
in Dante which set forth his notions of cosmog- 
ony, of the zodiac and planetary motions, and 
of the measurement of time. Dr. Moore in this 
essay makes it clear that the astronomical allu- 
sions are easily intelligible, and do not require 
the aid of the Nautical Almanac as an adjunct 
to their study. The essay on ' The Geography 
of Dante ' discusses the sources of his knowl- 
edge, and shows that he did not possess the 
exceptional acquaintance with the geographical 
science of his time that he did with the Ptole- 
maic system of astronomy. The essay on the 
date assumed by Dante for his Vision is a close 
examination of the arguments for 1300 and 
1301, respectively; reaching the conclusion that 
the former (and traditional) date is supported 
by the greater weight of evidence. Dr. Moore's 
fourth essay discusses certain questions of sym- 
bolism and prophecy that are raised by the last 
six cantos of the ' Purgatorio.' Here he con- 
troverts some of the positions of the late Pro- 
fessor Earle, and maintains stoutly ' the real 
personal existence of Beatrice.' The c-oncluding 
essay is a discussion of the genuineness of the 
epistle to Can Grande, which some scholars have 
questioned of late years. While it is not literally 
true that Dr. Moore makes short work of the 
skeptics, for his argument is both minute and 
voluminous, he disposes of these objecters very 
completely. This volume of Dr. Moore's essays 
is plentifully supplied with notes, lists of pas- 
sages and books, and synopses. It is, of course, 
a work of profound scholarship, thoroughly

equipped at every point, and entirely worthy of 
the author's great reputation among students 
of the diAdne poet. 

The work of Mr, Dods entitled ' Forerunners 
of Dante' has practically nothing to say about 
Dante himself, yet students of the * Divine 
Comedy ' will find their account in this interest- 
ing study of the unseen world as it was imag- 
ined by the seers and the legend-makers of 
ancient and mediaeval times. The object of the 
author's essay is ' to make some attempt at 
constructing, from visions only, the idea of 
Heaven, Purgatory, and Hell, which wias cur- 
rent at the beginning of the fourteenth cen- 
tury; not, be it distinctly understood, the idea 
which was actually present to the mind of the 
Florentine.' It is a research 'not conducted 
from Dante backwards, but from the infancy 
of the idea forward to the master interpreter 
as a convenient stopping-place and climax.' In 
selecting from the large amount of material 
offered, the author has placed his work on an 
ethical rather than a purely imaginative basis. 
Beginning with Babylonian and Egyptian 
myths of the dead, he goes on to consider Greek 
and Eoman examples (Odysseus, Ji^neas, Er, 
and Somnium Scipionis), and comes finally to 
early Christian legends, as found in the New 
Testament, the apocryphal books, and the 
ingenious imaginings of media3val times. All 
of these matters are summarized and discussed 
by Mr. Dods in as pleasing a manner as the 
subject permits, the treatment being addressed 
to a popular audience rather than to an assem- 
blage of scholars. 

' The Dread Inferno,' by Miss M. Alice Wyld, 
is an unpretentious little book of 'notes for 
beginners,' based upon several years of elemen- 
tary work with reading-classes. It takes us 
through the ' Inferno,' and supplies abundant 
references to the text as we go, besides a simple 
running commentary. The writer emphasizes 
the importance of Mr. P. H. Wicksteed's advice 
to ' read Dante's own words first and last, and 
the words of Dante's teachers, rather than those 
of his commentators.' The spirit of the book is 
reverent, and its essential teaching is found in 
the statement that ' Dante puts no one in Hell, 
but sorrowfully shows us how men — some of 
them beloved and honoured friends or heroes — 
put themselves there.' 

A work of somewhat similar scope, perhaps 
a trifle more scholarly in treatment, is Mr. 
Adolphus T. Ennis's ' Introduction to Dante's 
Inferno.' The author says that his object ' will 
have been accomplished if, by giving to the sym- 
bolism of words, and allegory of facts, that 
interpretation which canons based on intrinsic 
and extrinsic evidence can only sanction, it will 
contribute in the least degree to quicken the 
analvtical and comparative faculties of the stu- 



dent of Dante, so as to enable him to arrive at 
the true synthesis of the Divine Comedy.' This 
sentence fairly exemplifies the authors style, 
which is so ponderous as to make his book some- 
what dilficult to read. He writes from the 
standpoint of a Catholic, and speaks of Italy 
as his native country. 

The last book upon our list is a study by Pro- 
fessor Oscar Kuhns, of ' Dante and the English 
Poets from Chaucer to Tennyson.' It is a 
highly scholarly work, based upon a study of 
the standard commentators on Dante, as well 
as upon a thorough examination of English 
poetry for traces of Dante's influence. The 
author is not one of those who accept slight 
parallelisms as proof positive that one poet has 
inspired another, and is on his guard against 
being deceived by chance resemblances. This 
danger is particularly great in the case of the 
earlier English poets, who, together with Dante, 
to a certain extent drew their material from a 
common stock. The author says : ' To say noth- 
ing of natural coincidences, the whole period 
of the Middle Ages is full of a widely diffused 
materia poetica, if I may be allowed the expres- 
sion, consisting of constantly repeated thoughts 
and discussions, commonplaces of theology, 
philosophy, and social theories. . . . The 
same thing is true of certain metaphors and 
figures.' Professor Kuhns is possibly a trifle 
too cautious and skeptical in his fear of being 
deceived, but his example is a wholesome one in 
an age that finds a number of otherwise intel- 
ligent persons taking seriously the notion that 
the works of Bacon and of Shakespeare were 
written by the same person. More than half of 
this volume is devoted to the English poets of 
the nineteenth century, and even then only six 
of them are closely examined. We are very 
glad to have this little book, which belongs to 
an imperfectly-cultivated but extremely impor- 
tant branch of the historical criticism of litera- 
ture. We wish, with Professor Kuhns, that 
some one having the necessary equipment might 
undertake to trace the influence upon English 
literature of all the great foreign writers, — 
'not merely from a philological or scientific 
point of view, but with a sympathetic feeling 
for the esthetic and psychological processes 
involved in the making of literature.'

Problems of t he P resent South.* 

In order to appreciate the spirit and motive 
of Mr. Murphy's book entitled 'The Present 
South,' one should consider two facts in con- 
n ection with the life and vocation of its author. 

* Thk Present South. By E. Gardner Murphy. New 
York : The Macmillan Co.

We are told that it ' was written from within 
the life and thought of the South, by one who, 
through birth, education, and training, has 
shared its traditions and experience/ The other 
fact which it is worth while to know is that 
the author gave up his work as an Episcopal 
clergyman in order to become the executive 
agent of the Conference for Southern Educa- 
tion, whose chief mission is to bring about har- 
mony and helpful cooperation among the vari- 
ous elements concerned in the solution of the 
South's problems. Education is the chief re- 
liance of this Conference, as it is the chief 
factor which its agent exploits in the present 
volume. Mr, Murphy represents the connecting 
link between the best traditions of the old South 
and the more liberal and common-sense disposi- 
tion of the new. He does not stand alone, but 
typifies a class. The substance and spirit of 
this volume might easily have been produced 
by any one of a dozen men of the new South. 
Had the work appeared anonymously, the know- 
ing ones might, justly enoug'h, have ascribed 
the authorship to Chancellor Hill, Bishop Gal- 
loway, Professor John Spencer Bassett, Presi- 
dent Alderman, Professor Claxton, Dr. Dabney, 
or Mr. Walter H. Page ; albeit, it is doubtful if 
many of these Southern celebrities could have 
equalled, or any of them surpassed, Mr. Mur- 
phy in power and charm of literary style. This 
progressive and courageous group represents the 
erstwhile silent South which has so long re- 
mained tongue-tied under threat of political 
and social calamity. When such voices first 
began to make themselves heard, they were 
regarded either as simpletons, incendiaries, or 
harmless religious enthusiasts. Mr. George W. 
Cable was banished, Mr. Lewis H. Blair was 
ignored, Mr. Atticus G. Haygood was made a 
bishop. But of late this voice has become 
' something louder than before/ and has taken 
on such volume and power that it can no longer 
be ignored as an important factor in the South- 
ern situation. The late Dr. J. L. M. Curry was, 
during his lifetime, the dean and presiding 
genius of this new propaganda. At the same 
time there has sprung up in the North a set of 
men who have broken, if not with the spirit, at 
least with the erstwhile method, of Northern 
philanthropy, which lavished its purse and its 
compassion upon the most needy race, with little 
quest for compromise or cooperation with the 
dominant -sentiment within the field of its 
operation. Mr. Eobert C. Ogden and Mr. Will- 
iam H. Baldwin Jr. typify the spirit of this 
new Northern philanthropy. The union of 
these two forces North and South has resulted 
in the Conference for Southern Education and 
the General Education Board. These organiza- 
tions are composed of the same men differently 
distributed, and are under the leadership of 



the North, but are practically directed by the 
South. Mr. Murphy's book is the first full and 
effective expression of this new philanthropy. . 
It is indeed a voice from the South, but not so 
much the South that was or is as the South 
which is to be. The dominant South, that 
element which has captured political supremacy 
and shapes public policies, has based its tri- 
umph upon the enmity of race. Only the skil- 
ful politician knows, the value of hatred as a 
political dynamic. During the past ten years, 
no Southern statesman upon either floor of 
Congress has uttered one kindly or courageous 
word in behalf of his black constituents; but, 
on the other hand, they have incessantly 
breathed out hatred and bitterness. But Mr. 
Murphy stands for the awakening South, and 
typifies the conscience and culture of that sec- 
tion which must in the end triumph over 
organized and unreasoning arrogance. It is 
noticeable that the new spirit is the outgrowth 
of the educational idea, and illustrates the 
liberalizing influence of culture. Knowledge 
always gives a wider horizon and a broader 
vista, so that social evils, however vexed or 
pressing their present phase, are viewed in both 
their historic and prophetic perspective. It is 
only by the longest range of vision, reaching 
both forward and back, that the author sees 
with clear discernment the truth which he puts 
in the interrogative form only for emphasis: 
' Have prosperity, peace, and happiness, ever 
been successfully or permanently based upon 
indolence, inefficiency, and hopelessness? Since 
time began, has any human thing that God has 
made taken damage to itself or brought dam- 
age to the world through knowledge, truth, 
hope, and honest toil?' Will Senator Tillman 
or Governor Vardaman gainsay this principle? 
or will they persist in the declarations that uni- 
versal truth fails of effect only when applied to 
the black man? 

The key-note that runs thi*ough the whole 
treatment is based upon the dual assumption 
that the Negro in his present state is inferior 
to the white man, but that his condition 
is improvable. The author does not u.nder- 
take to set any limit to this improvability, 
unlike many of our social philosophers who 
assume full knowledge of the eternal decrees, 
arid tell us that the black man's status is unal- 
terably fixed in the divine scheme of things. 
Professor Bassett, of Trinity College, N, C, in 
a notable magazine article, ventured to predict 
that the Negro would gain equality some day, 
and for this he was made to suffer the penalty 
of persecution, the common lot of all seers who 
indulge in unpleasant prophecies, l^r. Mur- 
phy throughout this volume seems careful not 
to invite persecution or martyrdom. And yet 
his words are candid and courageous: 'Eecog-

nizing the double fact, — first the fact of the 
Negro's need, and then the fact of the Negro's 
promise, — the South has coQceived her respon- 
sibility, both as a policy of supreme self-interest 
and as an obligation of Christian stewardship.' 
The reader should always bear in mind that 
when the author speaks of ' the South ' he 
imputes to the dominant South a full portion of 
his own liberal spirit, and thus instead of por- 
traying the situation as it is we are given a 
foretaste of ' the substance of things hoped for.' 

The author upholds the two fundamental 
dogmas of the South, — viz., white supremacy 
and the denial of ' social equality ' to the Negro, 
— and endeavors to reconcile the black man's 
freest and fullest development to the limitation 
which these assumptions necessarily impose. 
These dogmas stir Southern sentiment, ah imo, 
as Virgil would say. Upon this territory one 
does well, to tread cautiously, for it is regarded 
as both dangerous and holy ground. It must be 
said, in all candor, that these topics are treated 
with much less moral assuredness and carrying 
conviction than the purely economic and educa- 
tional question where the author felt free to 
detach himself from traditional and provincial 
bias. The tight-rope walker whose chief con- 
cern is to preserve his balance must rely upon 
acrobatic skill. The assertion that ' the South 
was right and the North was right' leaves us 
somewhat bewildered as to the sharp distinc- 
tions between right and wrong which the moral- 
ist is wont to insist upon. The author, however, 
is not a doctrinnaire; he deals in applied rather 
than pure ethics. He does not impotently 
bewail the exigency of a pressing situation 
because the ' Ten Commandments will not 
budge.' The practical constructive statesman 
considers what can be done rather than what 
ought to be done. The author lays down a work- 
ing hypothesis, a modus vivendi, with little 
insistence upon moral abstractions. Many of 
the shortcomings of the South are glozed over 
with the nonchalant complacency of a recent 
writer who claimed that the Southern gentle- 
man possessed virtues that at once contravened 
and transcended the ordinary moralities. There 
is not a single note of unkindness or of con- 
scious injustice to the Negro between the lids of 
this book. The fullest opportunity and out- 
look are advocated, but it is not always made 
clear how these can be realized in face of 
restrictive theories that are upheld. 

We are told that the poor whites whom the 
slaveholding aristocracy pushed to the outer 
edge of the political and social circle have fused 
with their erstwhile betters, so as to form a 
white democracy of wliich the Nergo forms no 
part. This new democracy is dominated mainly 
by the nether element which has but lately 
become conscious of its political power. A 



novus homo, a Pharaoh that knew not Joseph 
the Black, is now on the throne. The ruling 
politicians who are now so frantic about white 
supremacy and so fearful of Negro domination 
never owned a slave nor anything else under the 
old regime. The old aristocrats who would con- 
tinue in politics must do so at the sufferance of 
their new and numerous allies. They are forced 
to sacrifice both their statesmanlike breadth of 
view and their traditionjal chivalric spirit. In 
the North, the democracy has become aristocrat- 
ized; in the South, the aristocracy has become 
democratized. In the large cities, however, the 
Southern conditions find an exact reduplica. 
The Congressional delegation from Massachu- 
setts represents the best traditions of the com- 
monwealth, but the reverse is the case in most 
of the old slave-holding States. The author 
asks, with solicitous though, with affirmative 
implication : ' Is the organization of democracy 
in our Southern States never to include him 
[the Negro] ? Is he never to be a factor of 
government and the heir of a free and generous 
life ? ' Modem democracy cannot be based upon 
the Grecian model which rested upon the 
enslaved masses that formed no part of the body 
politic. This is an impossibility both by reason 
of our theory of government and the relative 
numerical strength of the two races. The Negro 
forms scarcely a third of the South's popula- 
tion. Even under slavery, nine-tenths of the 
white race were throwTi outside the pale of 
aristocratic distinction, because the underlying 
basis of slavery was not broad enough t-o support 
so heavy a superincumbent weight. It is impos- 
sible to ennoble the entire white race in the 
South at the expense of the Negro. All aristo- 
cratic hierarchies must proceed with diminish- 
ing numbers according to the ascending scale of 
rank. The pyramid of class ennoblement can 
never be made to stand on its apex. 

Two chapters are devoted to child-labor in 
the South. This is the only topic in which 
the Negro is not made an integral and vital 
element. And yet the treatment of this white 
child -labor, which calls for such drastic meas- 
ures of reform, is suggestive of the reactionary 
effect of indifference to the hardship of Negro 
labor, as instanced in the convict lease and 
peonage systems. Cruelty in any form to the 
black man will ultimately redound to the detri- 
ment of the whites. In the play of Cymbeline, 
the queen orders her physician to prepare for 
her ' most dangerous compounds,' so that she 
might ' try their forces on such creatures as we 
count not worthy of hanging.' But the cautious 
physicia^ entered a most sagacious protest: 
' Your highness shall from this practice make 
your heart hard.' The South should beware 
lest the cruel and inhuman treatment heaped 
upon the Negro should harden their hearts

against like usiage practiced against their own 
race. 

The claim that the present degree of amalga- 
mation of the races is due to the presence in the 
South of the soldiers of both armies immedi- 
ately after the Civil War, rather than to the 
established practice of the slave regime, seems 
to be misleading both as to fact and inference; 
and it is hoped that the author will either sub- 
stantiate or withdraw this statement in the 
subsequent editions which the demand for a 
book in the main so hopeful and so helpful is 
sure to make necessary. Kelly Miller. 



Meanings of International. Trade.* 



There have arisen, in this country and 
abroad, two conflicting views concerning the 
nature and origin of foreign trade; and each 
view has had its authoritative exponents. By 
one class it has been urged that external trade 
is preceded by the national flag, and may 
accordingly and fittingly be instituted with 
impressive military ceremony by the admiral 
or general in command. By another, — and to 
this class of convinced free-traders Mr. Hob- 
aon, the author of a recent book on ' Interna- 
tional Tfade,' is well known to belong, — it is 
maintained! that trade, whether at home or 
between nations, is always preceded by the 
trader, who is always found acting individually 
and never in a public capacity. The 'higgling 
of the market,' the infinite voluntary meetings 
of ' pairs ' of buyers and sellers, — all this is 
what has visibly been going on al>out us, every 
day in the . year, in all ages. Yet the author 
has sought to extend the ratio of these free pri- 
vate exchanges in the home market to all meet- 
ings of all buyers and sellers in all markets the 
world over, foreign as well as domestic. Mr. 
Hobson holds that ' the principles of exchange 
of commodity are essentially the same, whether 
the exchange talces place between members of 
the same nation, and is called internal trade, or 
between m-embers of different nations and is 
called international trade.' 

In their vast and rapidly growing domestic 
trade, American citizens have before their eyes 
the best basis of comparison of free and unfree 
systems of exchange. Large numbers of these 
Americans are extensively engaged in both 
domestic and foreign trade. They will there- 
fore be better able to grasp, and to teach others 
to grasp, the full meaning of the economic prop- 
osition that the units of politics and commerce 
are not the same; that nations do not trade 
with each other, except in paper statistics, and 

•International Trade: An Application of Economic 
Theory. By John A. Hobson. New York : Charles 
Scribner's Sons. 



there only in a metaphoric sense. The false 
notion that nations are traders, we are told, is 
suggested by the fact that governments estab- 
lish ' tariffs ' and other politioo-economic devices 
for the real or supposed benefit of certain of 
their citizens grouped in * trades ' or ' interests.' 

Certain world-tendencies are described by the 
author, and are said to cause a keen interna- 
tional comparison of the efficiency of home 
capital and labor with that of foreign coun- 
tries ; to establish also international division of 
labor, which is at once the result and the cause 
of international trade. It is said that internal 
transport, the distributive trades, and profes- 
sional and other non-material productions, are 
engaging an ever-growing proportion of the 
national energy ; while as regards production of 
material forms of wealth, a larger proportion of 
workers are occupied in the final processes of 
adapting goods to the special tastes and habits 
of local groups of consumers. This implies, in 
a normal condition of industrial development, 
that a smaller proportion of the real wealth 
of a nation i. e., of the aggregate of goods and 
services, — is capable of forming the material 
of international trade. It implies, moreover, 
that an ever-increasing proportion of the ' real 
wealth ' is going into the material of domestic 
trade. 

As the book appears at the outset of our 
Presidential campaign, a discussion so timely 
and so candid of an important phase of the 
tariff controversy should be welcomed by intel- 
ligent students of American trade, of whatever 
economic persuasion. It makes a calm appeal, 
expressed in untechnical words, to the daily 
experience of the ordinary citizen.

Briefs on New Books. 



A modern book on ^or nearly a generation, the Eng- 
the Philosophy lisli translation of Rosencranz's 
of Education. 'Philosophy of Education,' a 

treatise written from an exclusively Hegelian 
standpoint in 1848, has been the only work in 
its field accessible to the American student. 
This fact gives interest to any attempt to 
develop the subject from a distinctively 
modern evolutionary standpoint. Such an 
attempt has been made by Dr. H. H. Home of 
Dartmouth, in a volume with the same title, now 
before us. The different chapters of the book 
discuss education in its various phases, such as 
disciplines, biology, physiology, sociology, psy- 
chology, and philosophy. Under each of these 
heads are epitomized the doctrines currently 
accepted in scientific circles, in a clear and sys- 
tematic manner. In the chapters treating of the 
sociological and philosophical aspects of educa- 
tion, Dr. Home shows considerable originality of

conception; he is much more at home in this por- 
tion of the book, as he himself states in the 
preface, than in the earlier chapters. The dis- 
tinguishing merit of the book is its catholicity ; it 
avoids close adherence to any one school of edu- 
cational theory, and is wholesomely positive in 
its positions. Some of the applications of the 
principles to cm-rent problems — like college ath- 
letics and elective studies — are not entirely suc- 
cessful, owing rather to lack of sufficient data 
than to any defect in the reasoning or point of 
view. The list of references attached to each 
chapter is too general and too inexact to be of 
much service to students. Dr. Home has undoubt- 
edly succeeded not only in supplying a long-felt 
need, but he has written a work which would be 
of significance even if there were already other 
excellent books in the same field. 

The leading ^r. Oscar Fay Adams, in his 
hoys'^ schools volume entitled 'Some Famous 
in America. American Schools' (Estes & Co.) 
has written a popular account of the nine leading 
boarding-school for boys in America, viz., Naza- 
reth Hall (Penn.), Phillips Andover, Phillips 
Exeter, Lawreneeville, St. Paul's, St. Mark's, 
Groton, Shattuck (Minn.), and Belmont (Calif.). 
Mr. Adams begins each of his chapters with an 
historical account which is decidedly more pic- 
turesque than comprehensive or enlightening. He 
then describes the social life of the school, its 
buildings and general out-of-doors environment. 
The book contains many excellent illustrations of 
school buildings and grounds, as well as much 
criticism of school architecture. The object for 
Avhich schools are ordinarily supposed to exist— 
intellectual development — is the one subject 
which the author frankly avoids. In his discussion 
of the social aspects of school life, which is sum- 
marized in the concluding chapter, Mr. Adams is 
fearless and just. The comparison introduced by 
implication in one or two instances between these 
schools and the great public schools of England 
would lead the English reader to form an exag- 
gerated notion of the part played by the American 
institutions. It may be said, in brief, that the 
author has produced a readable and fairly accu- 
rate account of the more superficial features of 
typical boarding-schools. 

An attempt at That Dr. Emil Reich is not lack- 
the psychology ing in confidence in his own 
of History. insight, is made plain by the scope 

of the small volume that he has recently put 
forth under the title 'Success Among Nations' 
(Harper). The book contains less than three 
hundred pages of moderate size; yet in this space 
the author has found room to pass in review all 
the prominent nations of the past, to measure 
and account for their success, and to attempt a 
survey of ten or twelve of the leading modem 
nations, to set forth the conditions in each that 
make for success or failure, and to prophesy its 
future. The book is necessarily very brief and 
sketchy in its treatment of this vast range of 
topics, and many of the author's broad generali- 
zations and positive conclusions the reader is 
likely to reject as unwarranted by the facts pre- 



sented. One cannot but admire his faith in his 
re-readings of history and in the hitherto unrec- 
ognized forces that he perceives in operation. 
Many of his conclusions are acute and stimulat- 
ing ; yet the reader will want to do some thinking 
of his own before accepting all of them. It may 
be fair to give a sentence from the preface which 
discloses the author's purpose: 'The attempt has 
been made to initiate the reader into the psycho- 
logical view of History, by giving, in outline and 
by means of a few illustrations, a bird 's-eye view 
of the human forces that have raised some nations 
to the glory of success, while their absence has 
prevented other nations from holding their own 
in the battle for historic existence.' 

The continent of, Prof. Israel Cook Russell's work 
North America in on North America, contributed to 
asinf/ievoiMwe. * ^ppleton's 'World Series,' is 
somewhat disappointing, and suffers by compari- 
son with the volumes that have alre;ady appeared. 
This, however, is through no fault of the author, 
but rather through that of the editor in assign- 
ing to him such a stupendous subject for geo- 
graphical treatment in a volume of 425 pages. 
The North American Continent is not only far 
greater in territorial extent than the other regions 
of the earth already treated or yet to be dealt 
with in the series, but it is also greater in the 
diversity of its various parts; and thus the com- 
pleteness of treatment shown in preceding 
volumes has been impossible in Professor Rus- 
sell's book. The author's task has been the more 
difficult in face of the fact that must seem sur- 
prising to most readers, that there are vast areas 
throughout the continent that have not been sur- 
veyed or mapped, districts, even in the thickly 
settled portions of the more enlightened coun- 
tries, of which there is little critical information 
available, and large portions of British America 
and Mexico that have never been traversed by 
observant men. Under these conditions, the 
author has been compelled to slight the economic 
branch of his subject, and to condense dispropor- 
tionately his treatment of the physical conditions 
of the continent. In the former division of the 
subject, his chapter on the Aborigines is a brief 
but clear summing up of the progress made in the 
solution of ethnological problems presented by 
the so-called 'Indians,' and by the Eskimos. His 
chapter on Political Geography is suggestive, but 
leaves much to be desired. In the other division 
of the subject his chapter on plant-life deals 
exclusively with forests and forest trees. Had his 
subject been limited to a portion of the conti- 
nent-the United States, for example,— he might 
have given us fuller geographical knowledge. In 
his list of books for the use of readers who desire 
to pursue further studies, it is significant that the 
greater number are official or semi-official publica- 
tions of the Gove rnment. ■

organization, the legal or the purely spiritual 
and inherent order, has caused much comment 
and controversy, and was finally settled, in the 
minds of many, upon the appearance of Professor 
Sohm's 'Kirchenreeht,' some twelve years ago. 
Mr. Lowrie, however, thinks the ideas there pre- 
sented not sufficiently known either in this coun- 
try or abroad; and his volume is decidedly a 
work of love as well as a propaganda of new 
ideas, written, as he says, to serve as an interpre- 
tation of the work of Professor Sohm. In carry- 
ing out his task Mr. Lowrie has shown excellent 
judgment; his equipment for it is of the very 
best, and his work generally is of the type 
which in time makes information from such a 
source both sought after and trusted. But, as 
the author himself has perhaps foreseen, the part 
he takes in the interpretation and translation of 
Sohm is likely to mislead those who have not 
read that author; and these are doubtless very 
many. To such, the book will seem neither 
Sohm's nor Lowrie 's. Although the latter is 
most conscientious in citing his authority when- 
ever he acts as a translator, and although Sohm 's 
spirit is felt to pervade the book, Mi'. Lowrie 
has appropriated but a small portion of Sohm, 
ajid has substituted discussions of his own which 
do not always harmonize with the writer he has 
quoted. The divergence between the two trends 
of thought is especially patent in the chapters 
where Mr. Lowrie speaks of the 'Charisma of 
Teaching' and the 'Eucharistic Assembly.' The 
book, with all its merits, becomes in many 
respects a blending of methods neither quite 
natural nor congenial. To be in partnership with 
an authority of Sohm's intellectual stature is at 
best a handicap, and we are disposed to think 
the author would do better in a work where he is 
standing on his own ground. His book has, how- 
ever, its special appeal in the loving interest it 
manifests in the primitive forms of the early 
Church, which in their beautiful simplicity and 
ardor of spirit put to shame our present coolness 
and stereotyped habits of worship. 

Mrs. Willoughby Hodgson's 'How 
Tofrciina. to Identify Old China' (George 

Bell, London) was written 'to 
help the amateur in the early stages of his study 
and the average collector who wishes to become 
more fully acquainted with his possessions,' 
rather than to add to the knowledge of the con- 
noisseur. So far as English wares are concerned 
— and only English chinas are considered — the 
book will be a real boon to those for whom it is 
intended, for it is briefly explicit with regard to 
pastes, glazes, and other fundamental matters, 
and gives sound advice about collecting, and 
warnings against fraud. Unfortunately, no book 
can follow the laboratory method, but it would 
be difficult for the printed page to come nearer 
than Mrs. Hodgson 's to placing the pieces of this 
'frail furniture' in one's hands. A brief history 
of each of the English factories is given, with 
clear descriptions of the designs, colors, and 
workmanship which characterized each period. 
Cuts of the various markings furnish an unmis- 



takable guide where such markings exist, and 
fine points of distinction are cited to help in 
identifying the different styles when markings 
were not used. Mrs. Hodgson confesses, however, 
that there are times when even the most expert 
collector follows wandering fires, and cannot be 
sure of his tea-cup. The forty full-page illus- 
trations are most bewitching in their display of 
Wedgewood, Chelsea, Derby, Worcester, and all 
others; but the beauty is not allowed to become 
bewildering, for text and illustrations are care- 
fully correlated. The obdurate anti-faddist 
should be careful not to let his eye rest on these 
pages, for he would be in danger of falling, like 
Horace Walpole, into the state in which 

'China's the passion of his soul ; 
A cup, a plate, a dish, a bowl, 
Can kindle wishes in his breast. 
Inflame with joy, or break bis rest.' 



Capt. Lawrence, Among the precious treasures of a 
American nation are its early heroes, around 

Sea-fighter. whom have gathered traditions 
that are the inspiration of its youth ajid have 
helped to form the national character. America 
is rich in these treasures, her annals containing 
the names of many men who, on sea or land, 
have shown the qualities that we call heroic, and 
have done deeds, perhaps not very great in them- 
selves, that the instinct of the people has fastened 
upon and incorporated into our national hero 
tales. One of these heroes of our earlier national 
history is James Lawrence, whose last cry, 
'Don't give up the ship,' is known to every 
schoolboy. A biographv of Captain Lawrence 
has been added to the series of the lives of 
'American Men of Energy' (Putnam), written 
by Lieutenant-Commander Albert Cleaves. The 
work seems to have been done with painstaking 
care and with skill, and the reader is carried along 
by his interest in the man and in the events of 
the wars with Tripoli and with England. Inci- 
dentally, the method of naval warfare of those 
days is clearly pictured, and the striking contrast 
between the little war-ships of that time and the 
huge masses of complicated machinery that now 
make up the navies of the world is of almost 
startling interest.

BRIEFER MENTION. 



' The Penetration of Arabia. ' by Mr. David 
George Hogarth, is published by the Frederick A. 
Stokes Co. It is a history of the explorations of 
the Arabian peninsula, compiled from the accounts 
of travellers by an enthusiastic student of the sub- 
ject, who is not, however, himself numbered among 
the explorers. It makes a fascinating story, and 
the many illustrations add greatly to its interest. 

Messrs. Longmans, Green & Co. publish a thin 
volume on ' Astronomical and Historical Chro- 
nology in the Battle of the Centuries,' by Mr. Wil- 
liam Leighton Jordan. In this little book the 
author wages valiant battle in behalf of a hope- 
less cause, namely, the reformation of our histori- 
cal chronology by the interpolation of a ' year ' 
between the two eras, thus falsifying history for 
the sake of facility in mathematical reckoning. 

Professor William H. Carruth has added to the 
considerable series of German texts edited by him 
' A German Reader,' with exercises intended for 
beginners. The reading matter provided is care- 
fully graded and presents ' complete pieces of 
moderate length and worthy literary quality. ' A 
complete comedy by Bendix, ' Die Liignerin, ' is 
the longest of the selections, which include about 
forty of the best short poems. Messrs. Ginn & Co. 
are the publishers. 

The monumental work done by the late Francis 
James Child in collecting and editing ballad poetry 
is now made accessible to everybody by the pub- 
lication of his ' English and Scottish Popular Bal- 
lads ' in a single volume of the ' Cambridge ' poets. 
The volume is edited by Mrs. Helen Child Sargent 
and Professor George Lyman Kittredge; we hardly 
need to add that it is published by Messrs. Hough- 
ton, Mifflin & Co. It gives us all but five of the 
three hundred and five ballads contained in the 
five great volumes of Child's work. Of course, we 
have only selected versions in the present case, 
and equally of course the apparatus is greatly 
cut down. A general introduction is written for 
this book by Professor Kittredge. There are over 
seven hundred and fifty pages, compactly printed 
in double columns. 

The second edition of ' The United States Cata- 
log,' edited by Miss Marion E. Potter, and pub- 
lished by the H. W. Wilson Co., Minneapolis, is 
a dictionary catalogue (author, title and subject 
in one alphabet) of the books in print in this 
country up to the year 1902. The first edition of 
the work was dated 1899, and many additions have 
been made for the three years following. The 
original portion of the catalogue has been checked 
over from beginning to end with the publishers' 
lists, and many changes in prices and publishers 
noted. Out-of-print books have not been altogether 
eliminated in this version, but that does not 
greatly matter. To this work ' The Monthly 



Cumulative Index ' of the same publishers is a sup- 
plement. The volume now issued extends to over 
two thousand double-columned pages, and is of 
great value for reference. 



Notes. 



' Geometry: An Elementary Treatise on the 
Theory and Practice of Euclid,' by Mr. S. O. 
Andrew, is a recent English importation of Messrs. 
E. P. Dutton & Co. 

'Ask Mamma; or, the Richest Commoner in 
England, ' with colored illustrations by John Leech, 
is republished by the Messrs. Appleton in their 
series of oldtime popular books. 

' George Chapman,' as edited ten years ago by 
Professor William Lyon Phelps, has just been 
added to the reissue of the ' Mermaid Series, ' 
imported by the Messrs. Scribner. 

' Not in the Curriculum ' is ' a book of friendly 
counsel to students by two recent college gradu- 
ates.' just published by the Fleming H. Revell 
Co., with an introduction by the Rev. Henry Van 
Dyke. 

Messrs. Curtis & Cameron publish a little book 
on ' The Legend of the Holy Grail ' as set forth in 
Mr. E. A. Abbey's frieze for the Boston Public 
Library. Mr. Sylvester Baxter is the author of 
this little book of description and interpretation. 

' The Legend of Parsifal, ' by Mrs. Mary Han- 
ford Ford, is published by the H. M.Caldwell Co. 
It is a small volume in simple language, mainly 
narrative, and based upon the reading of the 
sources as well as upon the study of Wagner's own 
text. 

A second series of American ' Historical Tales,' 
by Mr. Charles Morris, has for its title ' The 
Romance of Reality,' and is published by the J. B. 
Lippincott Co. as a book of supplementary reading 
for schools. The subjects range all the way from 
the early explorers to the romantic episodes of the 
Civil War. 

Mr. Nelson Case, the author, is himself also the 
publisher of a ' Constitutional History of the 
United States ' in a single volume of moderate 
dimensions. The treatment is, of course, brief, but 
it is much to the point, and the author has a 
marked talent for the lucid exposition of contro- 
verted matters, as well as for compact historical 
summary. 

' Copyright Cases, ' compiled by Mr. Arthur S. 
Hamlin, and published by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's 
Sons, is a summary of leading American decisions 
since 1891, the date of our ' international copy- 
right ' act, and includes also a selection of deci- 
sions in English and Canadian cases. The work 
has been prepared under the auspices of the Ameri- 
can Copyright League. 

The 'New Sayings of Jesus and Fragment of a 
Lost Gospel from Oxyrhyncus, ' edited by Messrs. 
B. P. Grenfell and Arthur S. Hunt and Miss Lucy 
Wharton Drexel, is published by the Oxford Uni- 
versity Press for the Egypt Exploration Fund. 
One plate, an extensive introduction, and a reprint 
of the ' Logia ' of 1897, are features of this slight 
but highly important publication.

The Trail of Lewis and Clark 

Was the pioneer American trail west of the Missouri river, and the results of that exploration of 1804-6 
were of tremendous importance to the United States, and they were never more apparent than now. 

A publication relating to the Lewis and Clark expedition, just issued by Q. P. Putnam's Sons, 
New York, stands peculiarly alone. This edition is a two volume, 8vo one, called •' The Trail of 
Lewis and Clark, 1804-1904." The author, Mr. Olin D. Wheeler, is the well known writer of 
the popular Wonderland series of the Northern Pacific Railway, in connection with which he made his 
studies and researches for this work. 

Mr. Wheeler has travelled several thousand miles over the route of Lewis and Clark. He has 
camped out, climbed mountains, followed old Indian traUs, and visited remote points made memorable by 
those explorers. Their route across the Bitterroot mountains has been followed, identified, and mapped. 

"The Trail of Lewis and Clark" is illustrated in color and half tone from paintings, 
drawings, and maps, by Paxson, DeCamp, and Russell, made under Mr. Wheeler's direction, and from 
photographs taken specially for the purpose. The writer tells his own story, and supplements it with 
pertinent extracts from Lewis and Clark, and a host of other historical and narrative writers that connect 
the past with the present. Exact experts and photographic reproductions, in half-tone, from the 
ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPT JOURNALS of Lewis and Clark are given. A chapter is devoted to 
the Louisiana Purchase, another to the preparatory measures for the exploration, and another to the 
history of each man of the expedition so far as known, including a discussion of the death of Captain 
Lewis. 

The Louisiana Purchase Exposition at St. Louis, and the Lewis and Clark Centennial 
to be held at Portland, Oregon, in 1905, make this work peculiarly timely because written from the 
standpoint of actual knowledge of past and present conditions of the old trail and country. 

«*The Trail of Lewis and Clark" should be found in every public and private library in the 
land, and the general reader will find in reading through its pages of large, clear type that truth is, 
indeed, stranger than fiction. 

The book can be ordered through any bookseller or news stand, or direct from the publishers.

VERGILIUS 



By IRVING BACHELLER 
Author of ''Eben Holden," etc. 

AFTER two years' work along new lines, Irving Bacheller has produced in " Vergilius " a story 
of new atmosphere and unusual power. The scenes are those of ancient Rome in the days of 
Augustus Casar, and of Palestine under the dark rule of Herod on the eve of the Nativity. The 
hero and heroine are Roman lovers of patrician birth, and their love stands out in sharp contrast to 
the effeminacy, luxury, and license of the Roman life about them. The story is one of tender 
affection and strong situations, and the final scene is a crowning touch of rare beaut)'. 

Post 8vOy Cloth, $1.35. 

A LADDER OF SWORDS 

By GILBERT PARKER 
Author of " The Right of Way," etc. 

IN wholly different vein from the author's last novel, " The Right of Way," comes this exquisite 
romance, delightful in conception, swift and compelling in interest, and written in the finished 
style of this great novelist. The story recounts the love of two Huguenot refugees, their fugitive 
life on the island of Jersey in the British Channel. Later the scene changes to England, where 
exciting intrigue and startling situations in the palace of Queen Elizabeth result in repeated dan- 
gers for the faithful lovers ; but they finally escape the hazardous favor of the great queen and are 
united. The scenes on the island of Jersey are of idyllic freshness and beauty, and in the Seigneur 
of Rosel, the lord of the island, the author has produced a character of delightful humor and brag- 
gadocio. It is a thoroughly rounded, satisfj-ing story, written with brilliancy and charm of style. 
Illustrated by the Kinneys.

JESS & CO. 



By J. J. BELL 
Author of " Wee Macgreegor,'* etc. 

JESS is a plucky Irishwoman of the peasant class ; she marries a happy-goJucky Irishman not 
overfond of work, who carries on a decrepit carpenter trade. Jess takes an interest in and then 
charge of his business, and makes it a paying concern, bringing the family out a successful and happy 
one in spite of the dismal prognostications of the village characters, who are all novel and amusing.

would indicate. But they bravely win their way into the hearts of their relatives and many inter- 
esting adventures foUow. Illustrated.

THE SEEKER 

BY 

Harry Leon Wilson 

Author of "The Spenders" 

The author of "The Spenders" has here written a powerful 
novel centering about the modern change in religious belief. 
It opens with a rarely charming description of child-life — a 
little girl and two brothers, one of whom cannot, even as a 
child, accept the conventional beliefs of those about him. The 
development of this boy along lines laid down by his own 
reason; his conflict with the sturdy, old-fashioned belief of the 
grandfather who secretly adores him ; the complication which 
arises from his love for the girl playmate who marries his smug 
brother; and the dramatic climax— all this chain of events makes 
a story that not only holds the reader but gives him new insight 
into some of the vital forces which are molding our social life.

THE MODERN SHORT STORY. [ 

This age cannot be accused of a lack of seri- 
ousness in its attitude toward its literary pro- 
ductions, as the attention given to the Short 
Story may prove. Whether this attention is 
justified, and the Short Story is a mould into 
which, as some believe, much of our best liter- 
ary energy is flowing,. time of course will show. 
But at all events there has been enough discus- 
sion already to justify a little more, and this 
literary form is certainly of sufficient impor- 
tance to excuse an attempt to answer the ques- 
tion. Is the Short Story a new literary develop- 
ment, and wherein lies its novelty? 

In the literary periods before the nineteenth 
century there is at least one form of short 
narrative with distinct and definable individu- 
ality. What the Italians called the 'novella/ 
and some English critics the 'anecdote story/ 
is distinguished by a compact plot with a point, 
a plot which preserves its characteristic fea- 
tures through innumerable changes of charac- 
ter and setting, so that like a minted coin it is 
capable of infinite passage from race to race 
mthout loss of identity. Such a narrative as 
Chaucer's ' Pardoner's Tale,' where two men, 
who slay two others for gold, are poisoned by 
the wine the latter bring, is an admirable exam- 
ple of the novella. * The JSTovellino ' and ' The 
Decameron,' or any of the collections of East- 
em stories, may be drawn upon for examples. 
The East was prolific of the 'novella'; the 
Italians, and afterwards the French, mastered 
it in the West, and gave it distinctive names, 
of which 'novella' perhaps has the most pre- 
cise meaning and may be most safely adopted. 
If you read the chronicles and looser stories of 
the middle ages, — the saints' legends, for exam- 
ple, — you can pick it out from the text like 
wheat-grains from chaff. Its distinctive mark 
is its compact and individual plot. 

For the other tales of these earlier periods, 
whether the interest lies in character or events, 
no such relatively precise delimitation is possi- 
ble. 'Euth' or 'Ali Baba' may be easily 
broadened. Chaucer's ' Man of Law's Tale ' is 
already like St. Brendan's great fish Jastoni 
that tries ' night & dai to pulte his tail in his 
mouth ac for gretnisse he nemai.' If we are 
to set them apart from longer forms, we must 
fall back upon Professor Matthews's indefinite 
but adequate distinction, as given in his ' Phi- 
losophy of the Short-story,' — unity of impres- 
sion in the narrower sense, singleness of effect,

THE DIAL

feimplicity of structure, a certain shortness. But 
defining thus, we may draw no sharp line 
between tale and romance. When the story 
attains a certain length, and the incidents are 
arranged in some definite order which leads 
to the working out of the plot, — when this plot, 
to use a figure from sentence structure, becomes 
complex instead of simple or compound, — then 
we begin to call the narrative a romance. 

We may thus conveniently group the short 
narratives of earlier periods under two heads 
{the latter subject to much subdivision), and 
80 compare them with our own productions. Is 
tlie first group, the novella, wholly identified 
with our typical Short Story? Certainly not; 
for some of the most characteristic of Short 
Stories place no dependence upon the plot — read 
* Markheim ' for an example, — while the plot 
is the mainstay and foundation of the novella. 
■Again, can we call our Short Story a simple 
tale of character or of incident, and group it 
with 'Ruth' and 'Ali Baba'? No again; for 
like the novella, these tales are written with an 
eye upon character aud incident only, while in 
the Short Stories of the past seventy years there 
is a new interest to be reckoned with. Aldrich, 
Stockton, and Bunner have given us excellent 
examples of the novella; but the best plots 
are used up, not adapted to squeamish tastes, 
or serving a new purpose. Writers are busy, 
too, with simple tales of character, or of event 
without particular ingenuity of plot. Good 
stories, like those of Irving, of Tieck, of Scott, 
belonged in this class ; and thousands of stories 
in our newspapers and hundreds in our maga- 
zines (most of them poor) belong there to-day. 
But these are not typical Short Stories. Exam- 
ine them — they seem old-fashioned now and are 
e&sily distinguished. Each one will be 
found to be based either upon a series of events 
interesting in themselves, or upon a series of 
events interesting because they bring out a char- 
acter or characters. The interest in a contrast 
between two characters, or in the relation 
between a man and the circumstances in which 
he is placed — the interest, in a word, in situa- 
tion — is rare in these tales, is rarely if ever 
the motive behind the story. 

In the short narrative of to-day it is most 
common; in the typical Short Story it is pre- 
vailing. It was not the situation that inter- 
ested the author of 'Ruth,' it was the simple 
love-story ; and he tells it with his eye upon the 
sequence of events. It was not the love-story 
which most interested Kipling in ' The Brush- 
wood Boy'; it was the strange situation 
between lovers who knew each other only in 
dreams, and for that situation, not for their 
love and marriage, he works out the story. The 
greater number of the most famous Short Story 



writers of the nineteenth centurj^ show by their 
stories that it was a situation which usually 
inspired them. Indeed, a glance through the 
pages of Kipling, Maupiassant, Harte, James, 
will perhaps be enough to show that interest 
in situation is typical of the characteristic 
Short Story. 

A situation may be recorded by a simple 
series of events arranged with the plot alone 
in view; but, since this situation itself is a 
result and not a process, such an incremental 
method must be crude. The writer of the 
Short Story is impressed by the situation, as 
Hawthorne so often was, and it is most natural 
that he should attempt to convey the impression 
he has received by making it the effect of his 
story. Theoretically, this is the logical method. 
A study of modem Short Stories shows that it 
is the practical one. In most of them the plot 
is interesting, but the total effect, as in Steven- 
son's 'A Lodging for the Night,' is after all 
the impression of a certain situation. Consider 
for an instant 'Youth,' a story recently pub- 
lished by Mr. Joseph Conrad. This is the 
narrative of a youth who from boyhood has 
longed to see the East, the wonderful mystic 
East. He is in his first responsible position, — 
mate of the ' Judea,' bound for Bankok. The 
ship is fated. Storms unfit her. She returns 
to port again and again, yet always his desire 
for the East and the romance of his going there 
sustain him. On the high seas at last, she 
crawls through the tropics. Months pass by, 
yet his eagerness suffers no abatement. But the 
ship is doomed. The cargo of coal ignites. 
They fight the smoke day after day. The flames 
burst forth. At last they desert the ship, and 
somewhere off Java take to the boats. At night 
they enter a dim harbor, tie at a wharf, and 
fall asleep at the thwarts. The youth awakes 
at daylight. A row of faces, brown and yellow, 
are staring at him ' without a murmur, without 
a sigh, without a movement.' Behind them, 
brown roofs of hidden houses peeped 'through 
the big leaves that hung shining and still.' 
And ' this was the East of the ancient naviga- 
tors, so old, so mysterious.' His ship is gone, 
and his plight is desperate ; but he has attained 
the desire of his youth. 

When the plot of this story is stated after 
the manner of ' The Decameron,' it is merely 
this : A youth desires to go to a certain place, 
and after many delays gets there. In short, it 
is scarcely a plot at all; it has no distinct point, 
and it is of importance only in so far as it 
serves a purpose that is something more than to 
make the story move for the sake of the narra- 
tive. The writer has conceived, not a story, 
but a situation. The aim of his narrative is to 
create in his reader's mind a vivid impression 



1904.] 



THE DIAL 



103 



of the desire of a boy for the wonders of the 
unknown East; and it does so with complete 
success. And this story is only a striking exam- 
ple of what may be found to a greater or less 
degree in dozens of stories by Poe, Hawthorne, 
Stevenson, Kipling, Maupassant, Ooppee, Verga, 
Tourgenieff, and other writers of our period 
If you analyze ^The Cask of Amontillado,' 
' The Fall of the House of Usher,' ' The White 
Old Maid,' ' Markheim,' 'Little Tobrah,' * La 
Peur,' ' Un Lache,' ' Garassim,' you will find 
that the author has a situation in mind, and 
is endeavoring to convey it to you; that to this 
attempt the purely narrative interest is at least 
subordinate; and that all the elements of the 
story are nicely calculated to produce the. proper 
impression. In some of Maupassant's stories 
the plot is absolutely negligible; and this we 
should expect of the French, whose tradition 
of short-story writing has given them a handi- 
cap in this development. 

The conscious purpose to convey an impres- 
sion is not implied by Professor Matthews's 
formula, which defines the Short Story by a 
certain unity of impression. ' Eip Van 
Winkle' would be explained and classified by 
such a definition, because the simplicity and 
restraint of its form produces a single impres- 
sion of narrative unity. A single impression 
of narrative unity belongs also to ^ Youth ' ; but 
this story has what '^Rip' has not, a conscious 
attempt to convey an impression of a situation 
which is the nucleus of the story. In ' Rip Van 
Winkle,' Irving is interested to some extent in 
situation, but much more in the series of events. 
And if one should rewrite ' Rip Van Winkle,' 
intending to convey an impression of the pathos 
of Rip's situation alone among strangers, a very 
different story would be the result. The story 
that has unity, restriction, and therefore a sin- 
gle effect, is not the same as the story with 
unity, restriction, and an attempt to convey an 
impression of a situation, although the term 
' short story ' is used fitly to cover both. Such 
a purpose in story-writing makes unity and sin- 
gleness of effect inevitable. In the old tales, 
these were attained because the incident treated 
of was single ; or if there were a number of epi- 
sodes, the narrative pointed to a speedy conclu- 
sion and could he brought into a small com- 
pass. In the best of the modern Short Stories, 
the writer (to repeat) has conceived not a story 
but a situation, and employs his narrative 
merely to impress this upon the reader. There- 
fore, be the story of one episode, like ' A Cow- 
ard,' or, like 'Without Benefit of Clergy,' of 
many, of well-jointed plot or of none at all, 
the impression must be unified, vivid, and dis- 
tinct from that ffiven bv the novel. 



In an essay by the present writer, first pub- 
lished in 1902 and now prefacing a recently 
published collection of stories, there is an 
attempt to trace the development of this impres- 
sionistic purpose. The development may be 
neglected here in order to emphasize more 
strongly than heretofore its cause, an interest- 
ing situation, and its result, a definite literary 
form. Here is something tangible and some- 
thing new. This interest in situation, which 
culminates in an attempt to carry over to the 
reader what the writer has felt, is a spirit per- 
vading the writing of our short stories. It is 
this spirit we must seek if we would discover 
what is the characteristic quality of a typical 
Short Story. This Short Story will belong to 
no rigidly separated class, like the sonnet or the 
ballad. Yet, when the impressionistic purpose 
has full sway, it does give us a new type of 
narrative; and even when it simply influences 
the story, it stamps a hallmark upon it. It is 
this spirit, therefore, which is to be sought for, 
rather than subtle and most often doubtful 
distinctions in form. 

The term 'short story,' in spite of its gen- 
eral sense, has come to have a specific meaning, 
which covers this new story of situation, the 
novella, and all short narratives which make 
a single impression of narrative unity. A new 
term seems superfluous. So far, I have used 
Short Story (with both words capitalized) for 
the little group of modern narratives inspired 
and affected to some degree by an impressionis- 
tic purpose. But it is hard to persuade the aver- 
age mind that capitals and hyphens make old 
words new ones, and either ' Short Story ' or 
Professor Matthews's ' Short-story ' is a poor 
substitute for a speciflc term, if meant to apply 
only to the impressionistic stories of a situa- 
tion, of which we have been speaking. These 
narratives, like the novellas, are 'short 
stories,' but even more than the novella do 
they clamor for a distinctive name. 'Impres- 
sion-story ' would at least point clearly to their 
most striking characteristic. If vague, it is all 
the better fitted to name a literary type markedi 
only by the appearance of a certain interest and 
a certain method of conveying it, and therefore 
set off by no definite bounds. The stories so 
named would include most of the best and most 
representative of our epoch. Other stories, 
which cannot be classified here, nor with the 
novella, and yet belong to the sihort story 
as we recognize and have defined it, may be so 
called. Like the novella and impression-story, 
they will be but special cases of a group. Such 
an arrangement will leave for looser and more 
rambling narrative, still reasonably short, the 
word 'tale,' which as commonly understood has 



104 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



just about that meaning. If usage will sanc- 
tion all of these terms, as it already has sanc- 
tioned some of them, so much the better for 
our convenience in writing and speaking of this 
subject. The short story has existed in all 
literary periods, and has always been reason- 
ably distinct from the novel, the romance, and 
the loose tale. Just as the Italians took over 
and developed to its highest excellence one 
of its forms, the novella, so we, in our attempt 
to convey a situation with greater vividness, 
have developed another, the impression- 
story. Perhaps it is the realization of new 
powers and new eJEfects thus gained which 
accounts in some measure for that considerable 
fraction of our literary energy withdrawn in 
the past century from more pretentious work 
and expended upon what was once a by-product, 
a miniature hardly worthy of the artist's sig- 
nature. 

Poe was the fount, in English at least, of 
this kind of impressionism, — a fact which 
suggests an interesting comparison. Professor 
Gummere points out in a recent article (* Mod- 
em Philology,' Odx)ber, 1903) that the differ- 
ence between primitive poetry and artistic 
poetry lies in their different suggestive powers. 
The primitive is incremental, and builds up its 
effects step by step. Artistic poetry, like 
Keats's ' Magic casements opening on the foam 
of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn,' is 
purely suggestive. It stirs the imagination, 
and lets it do the work. Perhaps prose fiction 
is merely following poetrv in this development. 
' The Lady of Shalott '" has the method of 
the impression-story. Tennyson forgoes the 
story of Launcelot and Elaine, neglects the 
incremental method, and, by a series of pictures 
and a certain symbolism, suggests — what but 
the pathos and the beauty of unhappy 
Elaine, who, wearying of shadows, has found a 
sting in life's reality! It is significant that 
Poe, whose poetry depends as much as any 
upon the suggestive power, should be a leader in 
the movement to sacrifice the incremental in 
story-telling, and to gain the desired effects by 
means of suggestion. The change in thought 
and feeling which has produced a more subtle, 
more analytic mind, that shifting of interests 
which has given the nineteenth century a dis- 
tinctly individual tone, is the result of some 
mental evolution which has not been thoroughly 
analyzed. But this new method of story-telling 
is as dependent upon it, and upon what lies 
behind it, as nature poetry, or the psychological 
novel, or any other reflection of man's mind 
which is more characteristic of our age than 
of those which have preceded it.

The Taixe Memoirs.* 



A second volume of Taine's 'Life and Let- 
ters,' in Mrs. R. L. Devonshire's fluent ren- 
dering, has recently been offered to the Eng- 
lish and American public, following the first 
volume after an interval of two years. The 
anonymous compiler has respected Taine's hor- 
ror of pujblicity and of personalities, and has 
given us, alm'ost w^holly in the great author's 
own words, a history of his intellectual and 
spiritual growth, rather than a picture of the 
man in his family and social relations — 
although these more intimate concerns are nec- 
essarily touched upon, and in a most pleasing 
manner, in many of the letters. Besides the 
correspondence, with a few explanatory pages 
inserted here and there by the compiler, the vol- 
umes contain occasional extracts from unpub- 
lished manuscripts, — notes and memoranda, 
mostly, of a fragmentary anid suggestive char- 
acter, with little attempt at literary form. But 
the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim is bet- 
ter than the vintage of Abiezer. This scanty 
aftermath might well have been added to and 
made a more prominent feature of the book. 

Bom at Vouziers in the Ardennes, in 1828, 
Hippolyte Adolphe Taine was fortunate both 
in his parentage and in his birthplace. The 
father, a country lawyer of cultured mind and 
considerable literary and musical talent, which 
found exercise in the composition of pretty 
verses and merry songs that are still remem- 
bered by his countrymen, had a passionate 
love of rural scenery, and used often to take his 
little son with him when, in the discharge of 
his professional duties, he drove through the 
beautiful Ardennes woods that add charm to 
the neighborhood of Vouziers. Jt may well 
have been these drives that implanted and 
strengthened in the younger Taine that ardent 
love of nature, especially of forest scenery, 
which found frequent expression in his works 
and correspondence. To his father, also, the 
boy owed his early education ; and when failing 
health and an early death deprived him of this 
loving teacher, the lad of thirteen had already 
laid a solid foundation for the more advanced 
studies of school and college. To his fondly 
devoted mother he owed, as boy and man, even 
more than to his father. Of the love and sjnn- 
pathy that held them united to the very last, 
we read:

' Nothing was more touching than the deep 
affection and perfect confidence which united the 
son to his mother, and we cannot give her greater 
praise than by reproducing the following frag- 
ment of a will that M. Taine wrote in December, 
1879, a few months before losing her: " If my 
mother survives me, my wife and children will 
remember that for forty years she was my only 
friend [here the French amie is more than our 
friend], that she afterwards shared with them the 
first place in my heart, that her life has been all 
devotion and tenderness." ' 

Readers of Taine will trace in his letters the 
birth and growth of many of those ideas that 
found their subsequent fuller expression in his 
published works. These letters, taken in their 
sequence, present the harmonious and uninter- 
rupted development of one who, at the early 
age of fourteen, drew up an elaborate scheme 
of study from which he never deviated. Spi- 
noza's motto, 'JAyq to think,' he made his own. 
' There are certain minds,' he early wrote, *" who 
live confined within themselves, and for whom 
passions, joys,' sorrows, and actions are alto- 
gether inward. I am of that number.' And 
again, in later years, speaking of the things of 
the mind, he said : ' A great idea within a man 
is like the iron spike that sculptors put in their 
statues; it impales and supports him.' The 
extent of his reading as a student was vast, and 
amazed both his classmates and Ms teachers. 
Plato, Aristotle, and the Church Fathers were 
among his early readings, and he classified and 
analyzed all he read. Taine's alleged and 
avowed infidelity (from the Eoman Catholic 
point of view) gives significance to the follow- 
ing extract from a letter written at the age of 
twenty : 

' Consider, my friend, that this God whose exist- 
ence seems to me to be mathematically proven, 
is not the absurd and cruel tyrant taught by relig- 
ions, and worshipped by the vulgar; consider 
also that neither is He Bossuet's Ood-man, busy 
saving or destroying empires, and founding His 
Church; finally, do not forget that if I believe in 
Him, it is not because I never doubted, nor from 
habit or sentiment; but after reasonings and dem- 
onstrations more rigorous than those of geometry.' 

Combined with the fresh and contagious 
enthusiasm of the young seeker for truth was a 
singularly sober view of human life and des- 
tiny. Long before knowledge of the world had 
worked its inevitable saddening effect, he wrote : 

' Happiness is impossible; calm is the supreme 
object of man, and it is unattainable to him who 
has not attained immutable convictions. I have 
done so; I have, I say, and my convictions become 
firmer and more extensive every day. I believe 
that absolute, linked, and geometrical science is 
possible; I am working at it and have already 
advanced two or three well marked steps. 
Some one said that philosophy, like mathematics, 
had been renovated two or three times, but had 



never changed — and that is very true. There is. 
a superior point of view from which we embrace 
the Whole of things and from which we easily 
unravel all diflBcuIties.' 

Thus early was the student of Hegel and Spi- 
noza working out for himself a system of syn- 
thetic philosophy. Again and again he writes to 
his bosom-friend Prevost-Paradol, counselling 
him to seek happiness within, to renounce am- 
bition, to ibeware of the allurements of society. 
' My object,' he declares, ' is the Good, or the Be- 
ing, as we used to say in Metaphysics ' ; and he 
sums up his aspirations in a desire to think 
much, to discover many new things, to gaze upon 
and produce objects of beauty, to have food for 
love and friendship, and to serve others. Yet on 
human love and friendship he would never be 
dependent. ' Man, when left alone,' he writes, 
' still has study. Art, Nature, and especially the 
Infinite, which alone can exhaust that immense 
power of loving which is in his soul. Philoso- 
phy is indeed a great teacher of love ; it is also 
a great teacher of resignation.' In his books 
he found balm for sorrow, holding with Mon- 
tesquieu that half an hour's reading can make 
us forget the worst troii(bles in life. This, at 
any rate, was his belief in early manhood. ' Try 
and get my mother too to read a little,' he coun- 
sels his sister Virginie ; ' it is the only 
way of soothing the mind and forgetting 
troubles.' In his somewhat uncongenial sur- 
roundings at Nevers, where he had his 
first taste of teaching, he rejoiced to find him- 
self independent of others for enjoyment. 
' I bury myself in philosophy,' he again writes 
to the same sister, ^and (forgive my fatuity!) 
I think myself good enough company not to be 
bored when alone. ... I am proud that 
other men's amusements do not amuse me. I 
should be unhappy if I saw no other object in 
my life than the attaining of some rank or 
other. My ambition goes far beyond that.' 
Something of a prig, perhaps it will be said. 
It is true his gayer comrades sometimes poked 
fun at the serious student, but he appears not 
to have been unpopular, while he certainly was 
admired for his extraordinary attainments. As 
might have been expected in one of his austere 
habits, woman's charms were suffered to make 
but slight appeal, and he had passed his fortieth 
birthday before he married, which he then did 
largely to please his mother who knew that he 
must before long lose her companionship. 

Taine's visits to England are of especial inter- 
est to us, as having to do with the preparation 
of what is to English and American readers his 
best-known work, the ' History of English Lit- 
erature.' In confirmation of his early-expressed 
estimate of the value of books, he writes in the 
summer of 1860 : 



106 



THE DIAL. 



[Sept. 1, 



' At present I am at Manchester, where one of 
my friends is showing me the working classes. 
All I can say is that I have acquired great esteem 
for literature and the information to be found in 
it; it seems to me that the judgments which it sug- 
gested to me in Paris were not false; the sight of 
things did not belie the views previously formed 
in my study; it confirmed, defined and developed 
them, but the general formulae remain in my 
opinion entirely the same.' 

English readers will note with approval his 
remarks on John Bull's affability and communi- 
cativeness. Unlike other foreign visitors, he 
found the English of every class admirably free 
from cold reserve and ready enough to talk and 
laugh even with strangers. ' I do not find them 
duller than the French/ he declares, '^and I 
should say they are as civil.' This speaks vol- 
umes for the personal charm Taine must have 
possessed. 

But far better than anything a reviewer can 
say about Taine or his. letters are those letters 
themselves. Let us re-cross the Channel with 
him and hear what he has to say about Gustave 
Flaubert. 

' A tall, vigorous man, with square shoulders, a 
thick moustache and a heavy appearance, not 
unlike a somewhat worn Cavalry officer, who has 
become addicted to tippling. Ponderous strength 
is the main feature of his conversation, tone and 
gestures. There is nothing refined about him, but 
a great frankness and naturalness; he is a primi- 
tive man, a " dreamer " and a " savage "; these two 
last words are his own. He is an obstinate toiler 
who strains his imagination and has to suffer the 
consequences. He seldom goes out in the evenings, 
and works a great deal at night, in a large, well 
warmed, lonely room, very noisily, " howling, per- 
spiring and drinking water," he says. When 
inspiration comes, he hardly eats or sleeps at all, 
but wakes up in the night to write. " My whole 
body is not too much to write with! "... 
After times of excitement come times of depres- 
sion ; he remains inert, lying on a sofa, " like a 
brute " horribly miserable.' 

And more, equally interesting, follows. From 
Taine's pen-portraits of Sainte Beuve, whom 
he delighted to honor, and whom he addressed 
as master, and of Eenan, with whom also he 
was on terms of intimacy, brief extracts must 
be taken. 

' Sainte Beuve has every moral quality, even 
modesty. He says: " I am very ignorant, I have 
learnt nothing; I only seem up to date because I 
have met several specialists! "... He is natu- 
rally timid, but becomes bolder through convic- 
tion and reflection. Youth is coming to him now 
at fifty-five years of age. The first impression that 
he produces is that of timidity; he speaks gently, 
in a low, insinuating voice; some of his syllables 
are almost indistinct. He is not unlike a fat 
priest or a large, prudent-looking cat. He has a 
bald head, with a pale, irregular, somewhat Chi- 
nese face, small, mocking eyes, and a sugary smile; 



altogether the aspect of a worldly ecclesiastic, 
suddenly transformed by lightning outbursts of 
frankness and firmness of belief.' 

'Renan is perfectly incapable of precise for- 
mulae; he does not go from one precise truth to 
another, but feels his way as he goes. He has 
impressions, a word which expresses the whole 
thing. . . His process of writing consists in 
throwing down bits of sentences, paragraph head- 
ings, here and there; when he has arrived at the 
sensation of the whole, he strings it all into one. 
. . Renan is not a society man; he does not 
know how to talk with ladies, but only with spe- 
cialists. He lacks the talent of intriguing, of seiz- 
ing opportunities. He is, before everything else, 
a man of one idea, the priest of a God. He prides 
himself justly enough on this fact.' 

Passing to matters more abstract, a para- 
graph on style is worth quoting, as the utter- 
ance of a master. 

'This constitutes style: to have a refined and 
passionate soul, capable of irohy, enthusiasm, 
hatred, admiration, to pass in the course of one 
page through twenty shades of emotion, to put 
fifty different intonations into fifty succeeding sen- 
tences, and to transfer those successive states 
exactly into the reader's mind — there is talent, 
or genius. Whoever can do so is a writer, whether 
he be a biographer, a^ poet, a novelist, an orator 
or a philosopher.' 

Of German culture, literature, art, our 
French, critic has but a poor opinion. He sees 
too much of the self-conscious and labored in 
the Teuton's acliievement. The German seems 
to him to say to his countrymen : ' We are not 
cultured; let us obtain culture; let us create 
artists, writers, poets, a unified State, etc' 
This is stroking Art the wrong way. Even 
Goethe and Schiller he cannot heartily admire. 
Of the ungainliness of German prose, and of 
certain grammatical peculiarities of the lan- 
guage, he speaks as a Frenchman may be ex- 
pected to speak, but with a few unexpected and 
astonishing errors of fact, possibly the result 
of haste rather than ignorance. Yet with all 
this distaste for things Teutonic, he came within 
a little of giving us a work on German litera- 
ture of the nineteenth century, including the 
latter part of the eighteenth. The outbreak 
of the war of 1870, however, interrupted his 
preparations, and thereafter his intellectual 
profoity forbade him to write on a subject that 
he could no longer treat with an unbiased mind. 

To those familiar with Taine's works, these 
letters will suggest, if they do not fully illus- 
trate, some of his more conspicuous merits and 
defects as a thinker and writer. He was before 
all else a logician, with a logician's strength and 
weakness. His fondness for generalization and 
abstraction amounted to a passion. ' Every man 
and every book,' he was wont to assert, ' can be 
summed up in three pages, and those three pages 



1904.] 



THE DIAL 



107 



can be summed up in three lines/ Supervis- 
ing his sister Sophie's studies, he instructed her 
to ' write an epitome of your author. Write an 
epitome of your epitome. Sum up your second 
epitome in four or five lines.' Thus always on 
the lookout for essential features and predomi- 
nant traits, as soon^as he thought he had found 
the one salient quality he massed all available 
evidence in support of his theory, and slighted 
or disregarded conflicting testimony. Herein 
he committed the very error for which he 
blamed the classicists: he was too fond of 
portraying the type, too enamored of the beauty 
of a general truth. In philosophy Taine was, 
as he avows himself in these letters, an inexora- 
ble determinist. Yet he exalts the power of the 
will, in himself and in others, to make and re- 
make the man. (See Vol. II., p. 210.) To 
his countrymen of the sixties he was the spokes- 
man of positivism. In one of his letters he 
clearly asserts that 'nothing exists but phe- 
nomena,' and in another he all but calls himself 
a positivist. But notwithstanding his determi- 
nism and positivism, his devotion to science 
and logic, he showed in his thought and in its 
expression a wonderful imaginative power that 
allied him to the romantic school which, as the 
advocate of scientific method, he so vigorously 
assailed. In fact he was, as M. Lemaitre has 
•called him, a poet-logician. He had a remarka- 
ble faculty for dramatizing abstractions, as 
another French critic has said of him. To use 
M. Bourget's expression, he had what may be 
called a philosophic imagination. 

Of the translator's part in this important 
work, little but good is to be said. Yet occa- 
sional errors are apparent even without the 
French original before one. A word is some- 
times too hastily rendered by one identical in 
form, as ' chariot wheels ' where nothing more 
dignified than 'cart wheels' appears to be in- 
tended. The definite article is here and there 
translated where our idiom requires its omission. 
Sheer nonsense even has found its way into the 
translation, as at the bottom of page 72 of the 
first volume. Three pages before, ' quarrels 
which refine the mind ' must be a false render- 
ing. But in general the English runs on with 
little to remind us that we are not reading the 
author's very words. 

We have followed Taine down to the out- 
break of the Franco-German war, when he was 
forty-two years old. This should have been 
only the early prime of his strength and pro- 
ductiveness; but his death at sixty-five indi- 
cates a too strenuous devotion to work in earlier 
life — or, perhaps with greater probability, con- 
genital defect of some sort, his father before him 
having died young. However, between forty- 
two and sixty-five are twenty-three good years. 



in many respects the best years of his life ; and 
the prospect of a third volume, if not also of a 
fourth, mitigates the regret with which we 
close the second. p^^^ j,_ Bicknell. 



The American Colonies in the 
Seventeenth Century.* 



High approval will be awarded Professor 
Osgood's work on ' The American Colonies in 
the Seventeenth Century ' by all who have the 
time and inclination to read it through. To 
say that such readers may be few in number, 
is merely to indicate that the book is written 
by a specialist, chiefly for specialists. The 
' general reader ' may be pardoned some trepida- 
tion when he is confronted with the thousand 
pages that constitute the body of this work, to 
say nothing of thirty-four pages of ' Contents ' 
and fifty-eight of ' Index.' Let him have cour- 
age and interest, however, and his diligence will 
be rewarded, for he will glean a rich garner of 
scientific investigation in American history. 

It is the particular service of this work to 
gather into one connected whole the scattered 
contributions made of late years by scholars 
all over this country and in England. It is a 
history of the Colonies from the standpoint of 
our latest knowledge, as Bancroft's was from 
that of his day. The author very rarely refers 
by name and title to monographs or books by 
other writers, perhaps for two reasons: first, 
because an exhaustive bibliography would have 
added to the already great size of the work; 
and secondly, because Professor Osgood writes 
from a personal acquaintance with the sources. 
There is little reference to unpublished manu- 
scripts, — a fact which perhaps explains the 
somewhat less clear and definite discussion of 
the Southern provinces, the records of which 
are still to a great extent unpublished. To cite 
one example, several of the county-court records 
of Maryland still exist, but have never been put 
into print. 

One can hardly approach the criticism of 
' The American Colonies ' without a reference 
to Professor Osgood's previous services in his 
chosen field. Certain articles, appearing from 
time to time in the 'Political Science Quar- 
terly,' the 'American Historical Review,' and 
the 'American Historical Association Reports,' 
elaborated first a re-statement of the principles 
by which the English colonies in America 
should be classified, and, secondly, a descrip- 
tion of the institutio ns of the various groups

in accordance with this classification. This 
same task is now attempted on a larger scale; 
and wMle most of the material is new, one 
finds pages, and at least one whole chapter, 
which have appeared in some of these earlier 
forms. 

Not merely amplification of illustration, but 
also re-statement of principles, marks the pres- 
ent work. In his former essays, and to some 
degree here, the author has attacked with vigor 
the classic division into Charter, Royal, and 
Proprietary colonies. In this criticism two 
points were urged: (1) that the use of 'char- 
ter' was unscientific and did not classify, 
because the proprietary colonies also had char- 
ters; (2) that the classification neglected the 
real differences between the groups, which are 
the differences in internal organization. Tried 
by this better test, — the internal organization 
of each of the colonies, — they may be divided 
into corporate colonies and provinces; while the 
latter may be subdivided into royal and proprie- 
tary provinces. • Now, in the corporate colony 
the powers of government are in the hands of a 
corporation, the freemen or full members of 
whicih are citizens of the commonwealth, and 
vice versa.. The executive, the legislative, and 
the Judicial officers all are elected, and laws 
are enacted, by this larger membership or its 
representatives; and government thus comes 
from below. This principle is best illustrated 
in the Constitution of the Massachusetts Bay 
colony from 1629 to 1684; while the other 
Puritan colonies of New England followed the 
same model. In the provinces, on the contrary, 
government proceeds from above downwards; 
that is, the officers derive their power and the 
people their rights from the grant of the King. 
In the royal provinces this is developed directly 
by commissions and instructions from the 
Crown to royal officials; in the proprietary 
provinces such powers are vested in the proprie- 
tor, who thus to a great extent stands in place 
of the King. The only real difference between 
the two forms of province lies in this inter- 
position of the proprietor with quasi-regal 
powers. 

This new classification possesses elements of 
permanent value. We are not surprised, how- 
ever, to find that Professor Osgood has some- 
what modified his earlier presentation. While 
still emphasizing the distinction between the 
corporation and the province, he now lays more 
stress on the possession of charters, whether by 
a corporation or by a proprietor; and he also 
recognizes and makes perfectly plain that in 
early years the corporation was a proprietor. 
The sub-title of these two volumes, — 'The Char- 
tered Colonies; Beginnings of Self-Govem- 
ment,' — explains why accounts of Virginia 



after 1624, of Maryland from 1689 to 1715, and 
of Massachusetts after 1684, are not included 
here; and therefore we welcome the author's 
promise of another part of his work, 
which shall deal with the royal provinces, and 
with the colonies from the standpoint of Great 
Britain. This promise of a wider outlook 
suggests our first stricture upon the present 
instalment. Even in dealing with local insti- 
tutions, it would be profitable to widen the field 
of comparison to other English colonies than 
those which later formed the United States. 

The two volumes before us comprise three 
parts. In Volume I., after the excellent intro- 
duction. Part I. treats of ' The Proprietary 
Province in its Earliest Form.' Four chapters 
suffice to describe the beginnings of coloniza- 
tion, the chartered stock-companies, and the 
constitutional history of Virginia to 1624. The 
discussion of the three Virginia charters is 
particularly clear and helpful. The author 
avoids the John Smith controversy and Mr. 
Alexander Brown's thesis that Smith was 
but the mouthpiece of a royal conspiracy against 
the Company. Smith, Professor Osgood thinks, 
was 'by instinct a good colonizer,' but of 
'events and views which for their authority 
rest wholly on the Map and Generall Historie 
. . . it is necessary to speak hypothetically ' 
(Vol. I., p. 53, and note). An important addi- 
tion to our previous information is found in 
the instructions of 1609 to Sir Thomas Gates, 
recently brought to light by Miss Kingsbury, 
among the Ashmolean MSS. in the Bodleian 
Library. These are carefully outlined by Pro- 
fessor Osgood, who thinks that the author was 
probably Sir Edwin Sandys himself (Vol. I., 
pp. 61-64, and note). 

The transition of Virginia from proprietary 
to royal government removes this colony from 
further consideration; and, after a very lucid 
chapter on the New England Council, the rest 
of the volume is devoted to the Corporate Colo- 
nies of New England. This constitutes Part 
I. Here again the story is excellently told, 
"wdth a definiteness painfully lacking in other 
writers. The tone of these chapters is emi- 
nently fair, and controversial questions, such 
as judgment of Massachusetts' treatment of 
religious dissent, are handled without acrimony 
or apology. Thus, in concluding his accounts 
of Mrs. Hutchinson's expulsion, he says: 

' By the attitude which they assumed toward 
the so-called Antinomian opinions the magistrates 
and clergy of Massachusetts definitely committed 
themselves to a close alliance for the purpose of 
upholding a system of strict orthodoxy. Tenden- 
cies which were operative when the religious test 
was enacted and when Roger Williams was ban- 
ished, now came fully to prevail. Pressure was 
brought to bear from the churches united in a

synod, from the clergy and magistrates in fre- 
quent conference, and from the general court as 
the highest expression of power in the colony, to 
keep local congregations and individuals alike in 
harmony with the doctrines and practices of the 
majority. From this union and resolve proceeded 
the body of legislation on ecclesiastical and moral 
subjects which has already been outlined. All 
parties must expressly or tacitly accept this, must 
yield it at least outward obedience, or leave the 
colony. Protest, whether by speech or action, 
was rigorously suppressed, and the secular power 
was resorted to for the purpose without hesita- 
tion. The life and thought of this colony and of 
other colonies, so far as its influence could be 
made to contest them, was cast in one narrow 
Puritan mould, and was not allowed to escape 
from it. So little was there of enlightment in 
New England outside the circle of ideas which 
the clergy imparted or controlled, that it was 
possible to maintain strict conformity for sixty 
years, and a type of thought which was essen- 
tially Puritan for nearly one hundred and fifty 
years longer. This, with the rigorous adminis- 
tration and political system which accompanied 
it, was the result of the appearance of the first 
learned class within the American colonies, and 
of its alliance with the secular authorities. But, 
though we consider Puritan New England to have 
been narrow and intolerant, we should remember 
that the intellectual activity which made even 
that possible did not exist in the other colonies 
at the middle of the eighteenth century.' (Vol. 
1, pp. 254-255.) 

The same calmness of judgment which fills this 
paragraph pervades the whole of the work. 

To the other corporate colonies, Plymouth, 
Connecticut, and Rhode Island, are devoted 
three chapters. The claim of the Fundamental 
Orders of Connecticut to be 'the first written 
Constitution known to history that created a 
government' (Fiske, * The Beginnings of New 
England,' p. 127) receives refr^hing if some- 
what destructive criticism. Gorton's fantastic 
career is subjected to less condemnation than 
one usually finds. Very interesting is the story 
of Rhode Island's constitutional growth, which, 
however, for some imexplained reason, is not 
carried beyond the granting of the royal charter. 
The interference of Massachusetts in the north- 
em settlements, Maine and Kew Hampshire, 
takes up one short chapter. Then follows 
another, upon Intercolonial Relations, in which 
the history of the New England Confederacy is 
somewhat unnecessarily drawn out. Of more 
striking value is the discussion of the Land Sys- 
tem in the Corporate Colonies, especially the 
suggestion as to the importance of land organi- 
zation and land disputes within the townships 
(pp. 466-7). Three more chapters on the 
Financial System, the System of Defense, and 
Indian Relations, bring to a close the first vol- 
ume and the second part of the work. 



In the sixteen chapters of the second volume, 
which constitutes Part III., is discussed the 
development of the Proprietary Province in its 
later forms. The first two and the last five 
chapters are general in scope, and deal with 
the Land System, the Judiciary, the Ecclesias- 
tical Relations, the Financial System, the Sysi- 
tem of Defense and the Indian Relations of 
these provinces taken together. In addition, 
one chapter or more is devoted to each province 
individually. 

By far the most valuable feature of this vol- 
ume, to the present reviewer's mind, is the 
excellent outline of the polity of New Nether- 
land, the transfer of government to the Eng- 
lish, and the proprietary regime in New York. 
Mr. Doyle's scholarly books, satisfactory in their 
time for the Eastern and Southern colonies, 
have never reached the consideration of those 
of the middle zone. Mr. Fiske's '^ Dutch and 
Quaker Colonies' stresses the social and politi- 
cal sides rather than the institutional. Penn- 
sylvania, indeed, has been adequately treated 
in many monographs, but there has been nota- 
bly lacking a good compact outline of the insti- 
tutional development of New York. This we 
now have, and here, perhaps, Professor Osgood 
is most upon his own ground. Beginning with 
the proprietary rule of the Dutch West India 
Company, the course of the official system is 
traced to the English conquest; the autocracy 
of the Governors is clearly brought out; and 
the quarrels of the Dutch with the Swedes to 
the south, with the English on Long Island, 
and with the New England colonies, are made 
thoroughly intelligible. The transition to Eng- 
lish government, the status of the colony under 
the rule of the latter, and the policy of the 
Duke of York with reference to the local legis- 
lature, make two interesting chapters, in com- 
parison with which that describing the division 
and re-division of New Jersey seems rather 
flat. 

In the case of Maryland, Pennsylvania, and 
the Carolinas, Professor Osgood's work is paral- 
leled by several more or lees recent works, and 
these chapters are perhaps less striking than 
some of the others. 

As the story proceeds, chapter by chapter, 
the contrasts between the two groups, — the 
corporations and the provinces, — make them- 
selves more and more evident. In both, the 
possession of land was important; but in the 
corporate colonies the land was usually a sim- 
ple freehold, while in the provinces many of 
the characteristics of the fief persisted. In the 
former, the only revenue from the land was 
that derived by taxation ; in the latter, the land 
office and proprietary control over quit-rents 
play a large part. The population of the New

England colonies was almost uniformly of Eng- 
lish stock, and settled in communities; in the 
middle and southern provinces the population 
was of more varied nationality, and the immi- 
grants came rather as individuals. In the East, 
religious uniformity was the expression of a 
common dissent; to the southward, diversity of 
creed was as noticeable as difference in nation- 
ality. Professor Osgood comments (Vol. II., 
p. 315, note) on the similarity in language 
betM^een the charters of Carolina and Maryland 
with reference to the maintenance of ' God's 
holy and true Christian religion,' and the ec- 
clesiastical authority given to the proprie- 
tors. We wish he had commented also upon 
the practical identity of parts of the important 
clauses which authorized toleration in the char- 
ters of Carolina and Ehode Island. Finally, in 
the author's view, the history of the corporation 
is that of a widening Democracy, that of the 
provinces recites the struggle of popular gov- 
ernment against feudal prerogative. 

We await with eagerness the completion of 
Professor Osgood's work. We shall be deeply 
interested in his treatment of Virginia under 
the royal government, and in his judgment of 
the English statesmen of the century, especially 
Cromwell and Clarendon. Of the effect of the 
commercial code upon colonial politics, these 
volumes have little to say; nor do we learn 
much of the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the 
Bishop of London. The extension of the Eng- 
lish law, also, remains to be discussed more 
fully in the subsequent volumes. Every true 
student of American history should consider 
it an obligation to read this work of Professor 
Osgood's. Most of all, as we close, let us urge 
upon any who have it in mind to bring forth 
text-books on American history for school or 
college, that it is especially their duty to know 
from cover to cover this comprehensive and 
satisfying synthesis of historical investigation 
and criticism. g^^ q^^^^^ l. Sioussat.

Two imposing volumes on Napoleon find 
their place in the series known as 'A History 
of the Art of War,' as illustrated in the lives 
of great captains, of which Colonel T. A. Dodge 
has already given us volumes on Hannibal, 
Caesar, and Gustavus Adolphus. The camt-

should precede those of Napoleon, were reduced 
to narrative form by Colonel Dodge several 
years ago ; but, as he explains in his preface, 
' the publication by the Great German General 
Staff of the early volumes of its extensive trea- 
tise on the Prussian King has interrupted the 
chronological sequence of this history ' ; and the 
author has decided to await the completion of 
that monumental work in order to avail himself 
of its many additions to the store of available 
facts. This series of military biographies is 
the magnum opus of Colonel Dodge's honorable 
career; and the volume on Napoleon is natur- 
ally its pars maadma. These first two volumes, 
aggregating 1,200 pages, close with the Eylau 
and Friedland campaigns of 1807; in the two 
remaining volumes we may expect equal ful- 
ness of detail in the treatment of the Penin- 
sular war, the retreat from Moscow, the battles 
round Leipzig, and Waterloo. It is easy to pre- 
dict that this will long remain the standard 
and definitive authority in English on the 
Napoleonic wars. 

At the outset, the reader is quietly reminded 
that ' this work deals with only the military 
life of Napoleon. The political events of this 
era, or indeed his personality, although replete 
with interest, can be touched on only so far 
as they illustrate the art of war or elucidate 
campaigns.' The book thus frankly appeals to 
students of the military art; its interest is 
largely esoteric and technical; and the general 
reader will find it pretty close reading. Thack- 
eray speaks of ' the great game of war ' ; Gen- 
eral Sherman said, ' War is hell ' ; and in its two 
aspects of international chess and international 
surgery (Napoleon called a battle an ^opera- 
tion ') , it is a legitimate and profoundly absorb- 
ing subject of professional study. To these 
two aspects Colonel Dodge has resolutely 
adhered, with the result of simplifying his task 
and freeing himself in great measure from the 
necessity of moralizing on or explaining away 
the darker phases of Napoleon's character. 
With unrestrained professional enthusiasm, he 
follows the almost flawless recond of the revo- 
lution in strategy and lihe ^far-flung battle 
line' wrought by the genius and energy of the 
Corsican; and the lay reader, following atten- 
tively the sharp and precise narrative, aided 
by abundant maps and diagrams, will perforce 
admit the thesis as proved, and realize that to 
the military mind Napoleon must loom supreme. 

In his first volume. Colonel Dodge devotes 
considerable space to the wars of the Kevolu- 
tionary era, before Bonaparte appeared on the 
scene. The rough and troublous times brought 
men of capability to the front, and developed 
in the ranks, along with a plentiful lack of dis- 
cipline in the modem sense, the splendid dash

and elan which have distinguished the French 
soldier in all campaigns, successful or unsuc- 
cessful. Bonaparte built high, and strong; but 
he found the foundation already laid. As the 
author sayS;, — 

' The French soldier was, in a certain formal 
sense, not well disciplined, but for the purposes 
of field work, — that is, for marching and fight- 
ing, — his discipline was perfect. What is usually 
understood by pipe-clay did not exist. What the 
little French infantryman is today, he was then. 
Far from being well set up, far from having the 
grand military air, he was yet hard as nails, will- 
ing, able to march, and ever ready to fight. If 
discipline be divided into garrison and field dis- 
cipline, of the former he had little, of the latter 
he had much. The Grand Army at Boulogne had 
much pipe-clay to boast of. The Grand Army 
after Austerlitz had little. It was not a parade- 
army, but it was a fighting machine. Whoso re- 
members the travel-stained, often ill-clothed and 
ill-equipped soldiers of the Army of the Potomac 
and the Western armies, who paraded through 
Washington at the end of the Civil War, will 
understand what is meaiit by the above. Whosio 
has been a part of those noble bodies will appre- 
ciate it still more keenly. Any State could have 
turned out a militia regiment which in appear- 
ance and minor tactics would have shamed those 
veterans of four years and hundreds of pitched 
battles. But he who had served with them could 
recognize that every musket was in order and 
every sabre sharp, and that the men knew how 
and were ready to use their weapons. Among all 
the troops the world has seen it is doubtful 
whether one hundred thousand men could have 
been collected from any source equal for intel- 
ligence and all-round soldierly qualities combined, 
to the one hundred thousand that might have been 
chosen from the men who passed before Abraham 
Lincoln on that two days' national review. After 
such fashion must we judge the common soldier 
of the (Napoleonic) Grand Army; he was not 
handsome to- look at, but he was untiring on the 
march and terrible in battle. If he was wanting 
in military discipline, this was more than made 
up by his war discipline.' 

These words of praise for the essential qualities 
which are the root of the matter in war may 
instructively be compared with recent criticisms 
in various quarters of the German army of 
to-day, — ^ aidmittedly the greatest fighting- 
machine of modem times, — ^and the insinua- 
tion that it is drilled to death, a victim of 
excessive pipe-clay and obsolescent tactics. 

The author, following Wartenburg, divides 
Napoleon's military career into three periods; 
the first, lasting till March, 1796, 'comprises 
the years when he was only one general out of 
many, and when in what he did he was com- 
pelled to pay heed to the ideas and prejudices 
of others, being hedged and hampered accord- 
ingly. In the second period (ending with the 
establishment of the Consulate, 18th Brumaire, 



1799) he was in sole command of his army, but 
had behind him a government which controlled 
the resources, and from which he must receive 
general orders. The third period (lasting to 
Waterloo, 1815) is that in which all the 
resources of France were in his sole control, 
and he could act as he saw fit.' Along the 
first two of the periods and well into the third 
we are carried, on a journey whose milestones 
bear the names Toulon, Lombardy, Arcole, 
Rivoli, Leoben, Campo Formio, Egypt, Syria, 
the Alps, Marengo, Hohenlimden, Ulm, Vienna, 
Austerlitz, Jena, Eylau, and Friedland. That 
the reader is enabled to hold out to the end is 
of course partly due to the undying fascination 
of the theme and the hero ; but also, too, to the 
lucidity and painstaking thoroughness of the 
treatment. Neither the making nor the read- 
ing of such a book is a holiday sport; but Colo- 
nel Dodge has handled his immense materiel 
with skill and a sense of proportion; and 
lias added every facility for lightening our task. 
The story of every campaign is illustrated with 
numerous maps and plans ; and to eadh chapter 
is prefixed, in smaller type, a useful half-page 
summary of its contents, for the benefit of 
those who must do some skipping. 

The author's resolution to confine himself to 
the military career of Napoleon, eschewing men- 
tion or criticism of his manners, morals, or 
politics, is generally well kept; but in the nar- 
rative of several famous — or infamous — acts, 
he allows himself a few words of comment, 
usually of an apologetic nature. To what 
extent these may avail in each case, we must 
leave to the readers who are unbiassed by 
'necessity, the tyrant's plea' to determine. 
For example, in speaking of Bonaparte's giving 
Pavia over to pillage (I., 245), the author 
says: 

' This cruelty — brutality if you will — has been 
much commented on; and, indeed, within little 
more than a century it seems scarcely possible. 
Yet the lives sacrificed at Pavia saved multitudes 
that by any other treatment would have been else- 
where lost; an example was needed if the French 
were to hold Lombardy, which they had fairly 
conquered, and Bonaparte delayed not, neither 
shrank from extreme measures in giving it.' 

Probably no act of Napoleon's has brought 
more odium upon his name than the massacre 
of the 2,000 prisoners at Jaffa in 1799. Colo- 
nel Dodge admits that ' from an ethical point 
of view, the act was no doubt unpardonable'; 
but claims that 'from a military standpoint it 
was a necessity. Salvs exercitus summa lex.' 
The execution of the Due d'Enghien is called 
(II., 134) an 'unfortunate episode, in which 
the act of over-zealous police officers was sus- 
tained by Napoleon's license or at least indif- 
ference.' The strong^t words of disapproval 



112 



THE DIAL, 



[Sept. 1, 



are reserved for the behavior of Napoleon at 
Sans Souci in 180G : 

' "While Napoleon reverently uncovered his head 
when he stepped within the portal of the narrow 
Potsdam vault, where beside his testy but honest 
father rest the ashes of this great man, he whose 
lineage and character were incomparably lower 
than those of the dead hero could yet not refrain 
from taking Frederick's sword and belt, to send 
to the Invalides. . . These relics, essentially 
Prussian, belonged at Sans Souci. Napoleon would 
have done himself credit by leaving them where 
they had so long been. But he was: a new-born 
emperor as Frederick had been a tme-born king. 
The main thought of the one was for himself; 
the other's only thought had ever been for his 
people.' 

At the very beginning of Bonaparte's career 
as a leader, his genius for combination, celerity, 
and fierce attack justifies all of Colonel Dodge's 
eulogy, and has indeed been the world's wonder 
for a century. He promptly repudiated the 
antiquated 'cordon' theory of long lines of 
defense, always took the initiative, and won his 
astonishing victories by adhering to his cardi- 
nal principle of always ' having more men than 
the enemy at the point of fighting contact. So 
soon as he had divided the allies, he held one 
with small forces and advanced in mass against 
the other. In what he did resided the whole 
theory of modern war. . . . To be their 
superior in numibers at the point of fighting 
contact is the basis of Napoleon's conduct of 
war; but it requires a Napoleonic coup d'oeil, 
speed, and decision to carry it out.' 

' Nothing is more marked in the whole Napo- 
leonic military scheme,' remarks the author, 
Hhan the intimate knowledge possessed by the 
Emperor of just how to use the national charac- 
ter in accomplishing results.' It is in this light 
that we must read the bombastic proclamations 
and orders of the day with which he was wont 
to fire the Gallic temperament of his men ; they 
accomplished their purpose. 

' In these little addresses the troops were usually 
told something about what was to be done. The 
French soldier had not the feeling that he was 
driven to battle; he was led to think the task 
before him an easy one and the risk small. . . 
During our Civil War the cry of " Boys, we have 
beaten them before, and we can beat them again! " 
was a not uncommon incentive to victory. So 
the French soldier, fired by his emperor's words 
and his captain's friendly and stirring address, 
entered into the conflict with the feeling that he 
would certainly emerge from it the victor.' 

Colonel Dodge frequently cites, as the require- 
ments to produce a great captain, exceptional 
intellect, exceptional character, and exceptional 
opportunity. These in full measure he attrib- 
utes to Alexander, Hannibal, Caesar, Gustavus 
Adolphus, Frederick, and Napoleon — the 



chosen six. To that first rank he will 
not admit Marlborough, nor Wellington (in 
spite of Waterloo), nor Grant; though he 
has high praise for them all. And so of 
Napoleon's famous marshals, he says: ' That 
they possessed in a very high degree the 
practical side of the art is unquestionable. 
How many of them were actually imbued with 
the divine part of the art will ever remain a 
question. Left to themselves in Spain, they 
failed to succeed, some of them even against 
regular Spanish troops. That they could not 
succeed against Wellington, who was a man of 
an entirely different stamp and who as a leader 
of men vastly outshone them all, is not to be 
wondered at.' It was after Austerlitz (Dec. 2, 
1805), in our author's opinion, that Napoleon 
first ' felt sure of himself,' though it is hard to 
see how any addition could have been made to 
the proud self-consciousness justified by Mar- 
engo (1800) and Ulm (October, 1805). Dur- 
ing the period covered by these first two vol- 
umes. Napoleon's star was steadily in the 
ascendant ; we shall await with interest Colonel 
Dodge's account and criticism of the reverses 
which marked the yeare from 1809 to 1815 and 
changed the arbiter of Europe into the captive 
of St. Helena. Josiah Renick Smith. 



The Beginnixgs of Expansion 
IN Retrospect.* 



A hundred years ago, the United States over- 
leaped the bounds of English exploration and 
settlement, and by a stroke of the pen the area 
of her domain was doubled, to include a vast 
territory which French and Spanish adventure 
had opened to the civilized world. The century 
of these hundred years closes upon a United 
States which has gone step by step tjo an ever 
enlarging empire built up on Latin lands, with 
the one exception of Alaska. The present day 
is a time of new departures — in ideas as well as 
in geographical expansion; and it is fitting to 
have our attention called to the origin of this 
great hundred years' expression of earth-hun- 
ger. The book now under review suggests such 
a retrospect in the words of its sub-title, — * A 
Story of the Great Exploration Across the Con- 
tinent in 1804-06, with a Description of the 
Old Trail, based upon Actual Travel over it, 
and of the Changes found a Century later.' 

The first chapter, in a brief yet illuminating 
summary, presents the causes of that ^ happy 
accident,' the Louisiana Purchase, and empha- 
sizes the part then played by Napoleon in

anticipating the idea of Canning — ' to call a 
new world into being to redress the ills of the 
old/ In 1803 Napoleon said to his ministers: 
' I know the full value of Louisiana, and I have 
been desirous of repairing the fault of the French 
negotiator who abandoned it in 1763. A few lines 
of the treaty have restored it to me, and I have 
scarcely recovered it when I must expect to lose it. 
But if it escapes from me it shall one day cost 
dearer to those who oblige me to strip myself of it, 
than to those to whom I wish to deliver it. The 
English have successively taken from France 
Canada, Cape Breton, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, 
and the richest portions of Asia. They shall not 
have the Mississippi which they covet. The con- 
quest of Louisiana would be easy if they only took 
the trouble to make a descent there. I have not 
a moment to lose in putting it out of their reach. 
I know not whether they are not already there. 
It is their usual course, and if I had been in their 
place I would not have waited. I think of ceding 
it to the United States. . . . They only ask of 
me one town in Louisiana; but I already consider 
the colony as entirely lost, and it appears to me 
that in the hands of this growing power it will be 
more useful to the policy and even to the commerce 
of France, than if I should attempt to keep it.' 

Due credit is given by Mr. Wheeler to our 
envoy, Robert R. Livingston, for taking advan- 
tage of this mood of Napoleon, and for his bold 
course in exceeding his instructions, under 
altered conditions, and purchasing the whole of 
Louisiana instead of merely the island of 
Orleans. The destiny of the IJnited States was 
thereby determined as a world-power instead of 
a coastal state hugging a narrow seaboard. He 
also says truly that Jefferson's part in this great 
transaction was largely secondary, if not acci- 
dental. But to Jefferson he accords a large 
place when it comes to the expedition of Lewis 
and Clark — for this was distinctively Jeffer- 
son's contribution to the growth of our territory, 
and by it he permanently secured that which 
had been gained by Gray's discovery of the 
Columbia in 1793, and extended the boundaries 
of the United StJates from the Atlantic to th.e 
Pacific Ocean. All that has come since, — the 
great conquest of 1848, Alaska, Hawaii, Porto 
Rico, the Philippines, Panama, — are but the 
sequence of that immortal journey in 1804-06. 
Well may the author place high the names of 
Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, and not 
unwisely does he give many pages to the per- 
sonnel of the expedition, not forgetting even 
the humble Indian squaw Sacagawea, the bird- 
wom^an, whose work and courage inspire this 
last narrator of her heroism to words of eloquent 
tribute. It is not, in truth, necessary to go as 
far as Mr. Wheeler does, when in contrasting 
the heroism of the battle-field with that dis- 
played by Lewis and Clark, he designates the 
former as ' a more or less superficial and phys- 
ical heroism,' and places the latter in the same 



category with that ' where the noble physician, 
with Christ's love for mankind alive within 
him, calmly goes into the plague-stricken 
region to aid dying humanity, and calls it 
' a deeper and purer, a moral heroism.' One 
who knows healthy masculine humanity between 
the ages of twenty and thirty-five knows that 
no other incentive is needed for the doing of 
self^sac^ificing and heroic deeds than the oppor- 
tunity for adventure. Nor would such men as 
have expanded our knowledge of the globe 
nearly from pole to pole claim any different 
motive for their exploits. 

In giving us this modern version of Lewis 
and Clark's journey, the author has done far 
more than to narrate the record of the expedi- 
tion. This is not the journal of the explorers, 
although it is enlivened by many citations 
from their journals, with which Mr. Wheeler 
enlarges his own excellent record. But as one 
follows through these pages, from the mouth 
of the Missouri to the mouth of the Columbia, 
and then back to the mouth of the Missouri in 
the ensuing year, he is made to know the whole 
route, not only as it was in 1804-06, but also 
as it is to-day, and as it has been in all the 
hundred years that lie between. Every side- 
light of history, biography, geography and 
science has been brought to bear upon a whole 
century of this 'trail,' and all the arts of the 
portrait-painter and of the draughtsman have 
been utilized to make a living picture of the 
actors and scenes presented. It is a beautiful 
and fascinating piece of work that has been 
done, and the publishers have not been unmind- 
ful of a suitable setting for so complete a pic- 
ture. As prefatory to the edition of the jour- 
nals of Lewis and Clark which Mr. Thwaites is 
now preparing, it will be welcome.

C AX ADA THROUGH BRITISH EYES.* 

Mr. A. G. Bradley, whose contributions to 
Canadian history have already earned him a 
deserved popularity on both sides of the 
Atlantic, has now attempted an elaborate 
descriptive work on the Dominion, which he 
entitles 'Canada in the Twentieth Century.' 
The book deals primarily, as its title implies, 
with the Canada of the present day; but in 
many cases Mr. Bradley has found it expedient, 
for the better understanding of existing condi- 
tions and problems, to sketch, briefly the past 
history of the country. 

That there is room for a book of this nature 
goes without saying. As a matter of fact, there

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



does not exist at present anything like a com- 
prehensive work on contemporary Canada. Mr. 
Bradley states that he has himself for many 
years past felt the need of a good general sketch 
of Canada and Canadian life in readable form, 
and that he has been constantly asked to recom- 
mend such a book, but was unable to do so. 
Finally, as no one else seemed disposed to take 
up the tiask, he determined to make the attempt 
himself; and the result we have before us. 

It must be stated at the outset, in favor of 
Mr. Bradley's book, that it is not the result of 
a flying visit to Canada. He quotes in his 
preface the familiar Canadian tradition of the 
Englishman who wroite a book on Canada, after 
a stay of three weeks in Toronto, which began 
with 'Canada is a flat country.' Both the 
United States and Canada have suffered repeat^- 
edly from this kind of transatlantic visitor, and 
we are thankful to know that Mr. Bradley is 
not one. 

As a matter of fact, the aiithor is peculiarly 
well fitted to give a graphic and intelligent pic- 
ture of present-day Canada. Over a quarter of 
a century ago he spent a dozen years of his life 
in the United States, engaged in agricultural 
pursuits. He was then, and has been since his 
return to England, a frequent visitor to Can- 
ada; and, finally, when he definitely undertook 
the preparation of this work he felt it impera- 
tive that he should place himself in touch with 
the very latest conditions of Canadian life, and 
to that end he spent seven months of last year 
in various parts of the Dominion, comparing 
the Canada of ten, twenty, thirty years ago with 
the Canada of to-day, renewing old acquaint- 
ances and picking up new ones, getting impres- 
sions and opinions from everyone he met, and 
noting with the eye of a shrewd and friendly 
critic both the weaknesses and virtues of Cana- 
dian character. He confesses at once that his 
point of view is optimistic. ' Happily, Canada 
will justify a good deal of cheery optimism.' 
Englishmen, he says, ' do not yet fully realize 
how great is the leap forward in every particu- 
lar that Canada has made in the last five years, 
and how immeasurably her horizon has broad- 
ened. ' 

The Maritime Provinces — ISTova 'Scotia, 
New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island — 
Mr. Bradley omits entirely from his book. In 
view of the importance of this section of the 
Dominion from many points of view, his excuse 
that something had to be omitted if the rest of 
Canada was to be covered, even inadequately, 
in a single volume, seems somewhat lame. One 
might suggest a good many places where com- 
pression could have been exercised with advan- 
tage, and room thus found for a chapter or two 
on the Maritime Provinces, without at all 
increasing the bulk of the work. A tendency. 



in fact, toward wordiness and repetition is one 
of the few faults that one can find with the 
book. 

Having eliminated the Maritime Provinces, 
Mir. Bradley adopts the convenient and graphic 
method of taking his readers on a personally 
conducted tour of the Dominion, from the 
moment when the transatlantic passenger gets 
his first and not too favorable view of the 
country in passing tlirough the Straits of Belle 
Isle, until he finally lands, safe and sound, 
and with a vastly clearer and more compre- 
hensive knowledge of Canada and its people, in 
the picturesque capital of British Columbia. 

It is a little surprising to find one usually so 
well informed in Canadian history as Mr. Brad- 
ley, repeating the exploded theory that Cabot's 
landfall was on tihe shores of Newfoundland. 
Even a superficial knowledge of recent Cabot 
literature would have made such a statement 
impossible. Historians are still at variance as 
to whether Cabot landed for the first time on 
the shoresi of Labrador or upon the coast of 
Cape Breton; but practically every modem 
investigator whose opinion counts for anything 
has long since discarded the Newfoundland 
landfall. 

Nor can one altogether excuse the statement, 
on page 22, that under Champlain's inspiration 
men from Quebec crossed the Eed River of the 
North and actually gazed upon the icy summits 
of the Rocky Mountains. This of course refers 
to the younger La Verendrye??, who were first 
among white men to make their way across 
the western prairies to the foot of the Rockies. 
It is a far cry, however, from the beginning of 
the seventeenth to the middle of the eighteenth 
century; and there are no grounds for sup- 
posing, even by a streteh of the imagination, 
that the La Verendryes carried out their bril- 
liant explorations in the West under the inspira- 
tion of Champlain. 

One is at a loss, too, to know what novelists 
are referred to on page 26, who are described 
as treating the French regime in Canada with 
lack of historical proportion and perspective, 
and describing the French-Canadian noble as 
attired in gorgeous apparel and dining off 
golden plate in marble halls. Certainly this 
does not apply to Canadian novelists who have 
taken New France for their scene. Parker, 
Kirby, De Gaspe, and Marmette, to mention 
no others, have all written novels whose his- 
torical background belongs to the French 
regime, but to none of these would the criticism 
apply. 

While in a critical mood it may perhaps be 
permissible to take exception to one or two 
crudities of style into which the author allows 
himself to fall. M. Menier is described in one 
place as having bought the island of Anticosti

' at one fell swoop ' ; Champlain is referred to, 
rather inadequately, as a ' fine fellow ' ; and 
again, the English and Dutch are said to have 
supplied the enemies of Quebec with arms ' now 
this long time.' However, one has no desire to 
be hypercritical, and these are only minor blem- 
ishes in a very excellent book. 

Mr. Bradley devotes his first four chapters to 
the province and people of Quebec ; and perhaps 
no part of his book reveals more strikingly his 
keen and accurate insight. He shows a knowl- 
edge of the life and character of the French- 
Canadians that few English-Canadians, and 
still fewer Englishmen, possess. He gives a 
vivid word-picture of Quebec, its unrivalled 
picturesqueness, its walls, gates, ancient build- 
ings, the atmosphere of other times that still 
clings to its quaint winding streets, its life so 
radically different from that of any other city 
on this continent. The history, too, of the old 
town, so replete with dramatic interest, is not 
forgotten ; though for a fuller treatment of the 
famous siege Mr. Bradley refers his readers to 
his earlier works, ' The Eight with France for 
North America' and 'Wolfe.' 

The relations of French-Canadians to their 
English-speaking fellow-countrymen are dis- 
cussed temperately and sanely, and throughout 
these chapters the author reveals himself as a 
warm admirer of all that is best in French- 
Canadian character. 

Here is an admirable contrast between the 
national points-of-view of the Quebecker and 
the Anglo-Canadian: 

' The vision of the Anglo-Canadian soars over 
forests, mountains, and prairies. His patriotism 
has kept pace with confederation. The village 
church is nothing to him, or very rarely so; while 
the soil or the water-power of British Columbia is 
very much the same as the soil or water-power of 
Ontario, if it serve his purpose better. Local 
attachment is not wholly wanting in the man of 
Ontario, but it bears no comparison to the point 
of view of the French-Canadian, who is individu- 
ally as much cut off from his European antecedents 
as if he were a Chinaman. To the most illiterate 
Anglo-Canadian the " old country " of his grand- 
father whence he sprang are tangible facts. The 
habitant, in this sense, has no " old country. " 
Artificial but ineffectual methods are resorted to 
by faddists or politicians to persuade him that he 
has an interest in the doings of modern Paris and 
modem France. But only think of it! Recall for 
a moment his long isolated past. Consider when 
and how and by whom French Canada was settled, 
and how old France treated her. Remember the 
early crystallization of the first batches of emi- 
grants and the absence of any serious infiux after 
the seventeenth century; then the conquest of the 
country by England; and finally, the French Revo- 
lution! There is absolutely no parallel between 
the links which bind the most representative 
classes in Ontario to Great Britain and the utter 



lack of connection between French Canada and 
France. When an unadaptable type of English- 
man arrives in Canada, his attitude is often the 
subject of local jest; but on those rare occasions 
when a native of old France, and particularly a 
native of Paris, descends upon the rural districts of 
Quebec, the mutual criticism which is aroused far 
transcends, I believe, anything that is ever wit- 
nessed among Anglo-Saxons of similar situation.' 

Moving on to Ontario, Mr. Bradley gives his 
readers a clear and intelligible account of pres- 
ent-day conditions in the premier province of 
the Dominion, both in town and country. He 
describes, as he has already done in the case 
of Montreal, the industrial, intellectual, and 
social features of Toronto, the attractiveness of 
the Canadian capital, and the energy and 
resourcefulness that characterize the rapidly 
growing towns of Western Ontario. The Onta- 
rio farmer absorbs the better part of a chapter; 
and both here, and later when he comes to deal 
with Manitoba and the North-West, Mr. Brad- 
ley gives the young Englishman who contem- 
plates emigrating to Canada and taking up 
farming a great deal of wholesome and much- 
needed advice. 

Passing on through that vast land of prom- 
ise. New Ontario, the author brings his readers 
to Winnipeg, the Gateway of the West, which 
bids fair to outrival all the cities of Eastern 
Canada within a few years. The vital questions 
of Western Canadian expansion, the rapid 
development of wheat and mixed farming, the 
influx of American, British, and other settlers, 
and other cognate topics, Mr. Bradley dis- 
cusses from the point of view of a shrewd and 
observing onlooker, one who plainly takes a 
warm interest in the welfare of the West. His 
views on the so-called ' American invasion ' of 
the Canadian North-West are interesting as 
those of a well-informed and clear-headed Eng- 
lishman who sees in the increasing emigration 
of experienced Western American farmers to the 
rich virgin lands of the North-West nothing but 
good to both Canada and her new settlers. 

Mr. Bradley shows a fine appreciation of the 
varied scenery of the country of which he treats. 
He has an eye not merely for the grandeur of 
Niagara, the majesty of the Eockies, the sea- 
like expanse of Superior, and the limitless 
horizon of the prairies, but as well for the pic- 
turesqueness of French-Canadian villages, the 
quiet charm of a bit of rural Ontario, and the 
vivid coloring of a British Columbian valley in 
autumn — where the dogwood blossoms in 
November. Everywhere and always he notes 
with enthusiasm the clear, dry, bracing air of 
the North, which more than anything else has 
contributed to make Canadians healthy in body 
and mind. 

The book contains a large number of clear

Recent Poetry.* 



One rises from a perusal of * The Divine Vision ' 
with a feeling of having been steeped in the very 
essence of poetry, of having learned the secret 
of the springs of song. The sense is long there- 
after haunted by soft melodies and beautiful pic- 
tures, by a sort of transcendental vision wherein 
are mingled flowers and birds and jewels, colors 
and odors, and elemental presences. Of thought 
in logical form there is little or nothing, and of 
story hardly more, in this residuum of recollec- 
tion; but there is an iridescent imaginative haze 
in which it is pleasant to linger. Let us quote, 
by way of illustration, the opening lines of 'The 
Feast of Age.' 

' See where the light streams over Connla's fountain 

Starward aspire ! 
The sacred sign upon the holy mountain 

Shines in white fire : 
Wavering and flaming yonder o'er the snows 

The diamond Hght 
Melts into silver or of sapphire glows, 

Night beyond night : 
And from the Heaven of Heaven descends on earth 

A dew divine. 
Come, let us mingle in the starry mirth 

Around the shrine. 
O Earth, Enchantress, Mother, to our home 

In thee we press. 
Thrilled by thy fiery breath and wrapt in some 

Vast tenderness. 
The homeward birds, uncertain o'er their nest. 

Wheel in the dome. 
Fraught with dim dreams of more enraptured rest. 

Another home. 
But gather ye, to whose undarkened eyes 

Night is as day, 
Leap forth, immortals, Birds of Paradise, 

In bright array. 
Robed lilie the shining tresses of the sun. 

And by his name 
Call from his haunt divine the ancient one. 

Our Father Flame. '

We must also find room for a few stanzas from 
that wonderful poem, 'The Twilight of Earth.' 

' The wonder of the world is o'er ; 

The magic from the sea is gone : 
There is no unimagined shore. 

No islet yet to venture on. 
The Sacred Hazels' blooms are shed. 
The Nuts of Knowledge harvested. 

' Oh, what is worth this lore of age 

If Time shall never bring us back 

Our battle with the gods to wage 
Reeling along the starry track. 

The battle rapture here goes by 

In warring upon things that die. 

' Let be the tale of him whose love 

Was sighed between white Deirdre's breasts. 

It will not lift the heart above 

The sodden clay on which it rests. 

Love once had power the gods to bring 

All rapt on its wild wandering. 

' We dwindle down beneath the skies. 
And from ourselves we pass away : 

The paradise of memories 

Grows ever fainter day by day. 

The shepherd stars have shrunk within. 

The world's great night will soon begin. 

' Will no one, ere it is too late. 

Ere fades the last memorial gleam. 

Recall for us our earlier state? 

For nothing but so vast a dream 

That it would scale the steeps of air 

Could rouse us from so vast despair. 

• Oh, while the glory sinks within 

Let us not wait on earth behind. 

But follow where it flies, and win 

The glow again, and we may find 

Beyond the Gateways of the Day 

Dominion and ancestral sway. ' 

Such poetry as this— and the examples we have 
quoted are" by no means exceptional— is a joy 
forever. It is well known that 'A. E.' is Mr. 
George Russell, and that he is one of the most 
remarkable of the men associated with the Celtic 
revival. To us, his special charm results from 
the fact that his inspiration is more eclectic than 
that of his fellow-workers. His poems have 
the peculiar Celtic magic in the fullest measure; 
but they have also something of Hellenic sugges- 
tion, and the mysticism with which they are in- 
fused is of 'the brooding East' even more than 
it is of the Isle of Saints. 

Mr. William Watson was, as most of us know, 
a convinced and earnest opponent of the course 
taken by the English government in its recent 
dealings with South Africa. He held the war to 
be an unrighteous one, ignoring, as we think, the 
fundamental facts that it was begun by the 
Boers, and that England's main object m its 
prosecution was to free Englishmen from the 
oppression of a corrupt minority intrenched in 
power. But of Mr. Watson's sincerity m his 
attitude, there can be no manner of doubt; and 
his contributions in verse, made from time to 
time to English journals during the period of the 
war, have a more than ephemeral value. They 
have been collected— some two dozen short pieces 
—into a volume entitled ' For England: Poems 
Written during Estrangement.' We quote the 
pair of stanzas on 'Rome and Another,' be- 
cause it is simple and effective, and because it

has a more significant message for our own coun- 
try than for its author's own. 

' She asked for all things, and dominion such 

As never man had known. 
The gods first gave ; then lightly, touch by touch, 
O'erthrew her seven-hilled throne. 

' Imperial Power, that hungerest for the globe. 

Restrain thy conquering feet. 
Lest the same Fates that spun thy purple robe 

Should weave thy winding-sheet. ' 

The 'Land and Sea Pieces' of Mr. Arthur 
E. J. Legge portray the type of mind which is 
restless in the world of accepted creed and con- 
vention, and is ever groping to find the permanent 
beneath the illusory, to escape from the meaning- 
less distinctions of everyday life and find refuge 
in the eternal verities. This may seem a ponder- 
ous way of accounting for a collection of poems 
that are for the most part simple and unpreten- 
tious, and that are even at times conceived in a 
half-flippant spirit; but the note which we have 
suggested is struck again and again. We hear it 
in the poem called 'Olivia's Garden,' which 
deals manfully and cleanly with the theme of 
Rossetti's *■ Jenny '; we find it in ' The Death- 
Mask of Leopardi.' 

' Ah, let me conquer doubt ! 
To suffer and to sorrow more than most 
Has been the poet's privilege through all time, 

To leave the vulgar host 
Who follow Comus in unlovely rout, 
And search through that dim shadow-land without 

For something more sublime. ' 

Again we find it in the closing lines of that 
fine poem, 'Raleigh's Lost Voyage.' 

' Poor world 
Of baffled phantoms ! Have our deaths and births 
Much meaning after all? Well, here at last 
Passes a man moulded in Life's red fire. 

Fate weaves a chequered groundwork for such souls ; 

Dark, transient Evil, — bright, eternal Good. ' 

Again we find it in 'Prometheus,' in the 
words dedicated to all those who follow in the 
footsteps of the Titan, and defy, and endure. 

' Their tombs arc marble mile-stones on the road 
Nations have trod to freedom. Their names ring through 
tales 

Cherished in lonely dales 
And mountain homes, — through songs the people sing 
Behind the plough, or with the harvest-load. 

Like stars they gleam 
Out of the human gloom and storm-clad past. 
And in the march of many a youthful dream 

They sound a trurapet-blast. ' 

And still again we find it in the verses in- 
scribed to 'Elle et Lui,' to Michael Angelo, 
and to Charles Kingsley in the poem 'Eversley,' 
from which we make our final quotation. 

' Old dogmas are outworn 
That he taught in this little church; and all creeds die; 
And teachers pass ; and the lesson-pages are torn, 

And the dusty books laid by ; 
But, at least, this man has helped us to hear the note 
Of the wordless song whose wandering murmurs float 
From fields that the sunlight splashes with golden-brown 
As it plays on the shocks of corn, from woods that crown 
The sloping ridges, from meadow and lane and heath. 
And crowded pines, with a blush of heather beneath. 
And the stream where the fat trout lie ; — oh, here is rest 
From the world, with Its fevered brain and panting breast. 
And Youth comes back with its visions and that sweet dawn 
Of Hope, that lighted the dew upon dream-land's lawn. 
And set all the colors aflame in the garden-beds 
Where the flowers of love and glory lifted their heads. 
And we see the land we had lost, and forget the din 



Of a jarring age, and learn the wisdom anew. 
That tells how only the losers in life shall win 
And only the dreams be true. ' 

We can hardly praise too highly the thought- 
fulness and sincerity of this book; these are its 
essential qualities, albeit the author commands 
sufficient poetic expression for their graceful 
adornment. 

In part a republication, and in part new, the 
' Secret Nights ' of Mr. J. A. Nicklin offers us a 
slender but exquisite collection of verse. Four 
sonnets and something more than a dozen lyrics 
make up the sum total; but each piece is care- 
fully wrought, and tempts us to linger over its 
musical cadence. The sonnet called 'The Poet's 
Mass' shall be our selection. 

' Before an altar of deep-jeweled blaze 

The poet, pale, with gracious head down-bent. 
Serves on his knees Love's awful sacrament. 

Swinging a censer of delicious praise 

He draws eternity into his gaze 

And falters forth the god within him pent. 
Then, when his hour of worship is full- spent. 

Leaves the still shrine for wild, tumultuous ways. 

Ah, strew before him roses red and white ! 

Red roses are the crimson prints of pain. 
But white for purity and for delight. 

Let tremulous music fall in silver* rain. 
And the waved torches flame into the night. 

And make night splendid, and the street Love's fane. ' 

Mr. Nicklin 's verses have a touch of decadence, 
and more than a hint of Henley; but they are by 
no means obvious imitations, and are entitled to 
stand upon their own merits. 

'The Temple of Friendship, and Other Poems,' 
by Mr. Vincent Benson, is a work characterized 
by marked poetical sensibility. Whatever is 
beautiful in art, nature, and life, makes a forci- 
ble appeal to the writer, whose gift of expres- 
sion is sufficiently developed to make his verses 
more than agreeable to the refined intelligence. 
A few of his pieces are intimately personal; 
but most of them are of bookish inspiration, 
revealing especially the sympathetic student of 
the classics. We quote the personal confession of 
'The Fountain Head.' 

' As I read o'er again the parable 

Of that fierce house where sin and sorrow slept, 

The giant singer of Eleusis wept 

His very soul Into my soul, and full 

Of love and yearning for so beautiful 

A truth, I turned to Weimar's iron bard. 

Who sang a woe Indeed, but a woe marred 

By higher weal, and a love dutiful. 

Then cried, " O bring me to the fountain-head, 
That I may weep and dread and love as ne'er 
But poet can. " Yet none gave answer there. 
Only methought as the slow sun sank red 
Upon the sea, and the wind soughed to bed, 
Apollo passed me with his gleaming hair. ' 

Mr. Benson is a poet of the tribe of Alfred, 
bringing to him that tribute which is the sin- 
cerest form of flattery. 'The Lotus Eaters' sug- 
gests the theme, and is clearly the inspiration, of 
'The Island of No Death,' while 'Moenia Mundi' 
is venturesome enough to reproduce for us the 
last thoughts of Lucretius in the soliloquy of his 
dying hour. 

'The Last Days of Theodorie the Ostrogoth, 
and Other Verses,' an anonymous collection, is, 
like the volume mentioned just before, an Oxford

production. The stately and sombre title-poem 
is a fine example of reflective verse written in 
rhymed couplets. These are the prophetic closing 
lines : 

' What though my glory fade from memory. 

And men deny my tolls the meed of praise? 

Enough for me to know that after-days 

Will see the work fulflll'd wherein I failed, 

Will see my people's glory unassalled, 

Crowned with more lasting triumphs than were mine. 

Men's eyes are dim ; the future gives no sign 

Of aught that Is to be ; we can but trust 

That good will vanquish evil. God Is just. 

It may be — for the voice of time is dumb — 

That years of toil and war are still to come. 

Of civil tumult, slavery and pain ; 

Yet at the last this land I loved will gain 

Freedom and peace, and men once more will see 

A glorious and united Italy. 

Many of the pieces in this volume are written 
in a light and pleasing vein, but the deeper note 
is not far off. The following sonnet on 'Gib- 
raltar' is an example of the author's work at its 
best: 

' On Calpe's rock the wild narcissus grows, 
Lives Its short life in lone humility. 
Then fades away that other blooms may be. 

And where it grew no living creature knows. 

And that stupendous rock whereon it grows 

Heedless of one poor flower's mortality 
Stands changeless by the ever-changing sea; 

Whose tide like life forever ebbs and flows. 

So let this fragile flower of verse, my friend, 

Live its short life unharmed. Its root is frail. 
Its stem made slenderly. Its petals pale 

One ruthless foot, one biting breeze would rend. 
So let It live its day, and when It dies 
Tell no one where my dead narcissus lies. ' 

Ours, at least, shall not be the 'ruthless foot' 
to rend so graceful and delicate a flower of verse 
as this. 

Mr. Clinton Scollard's new volume is called 
* The Lyric Bough. ' It is a collection of miscel- 
laneous pieces, the greater number having aspects 
of nature for their theme. 'An Autumn Song' 
offers a favorable illustration of this quality. 

' Again the old heraldic pomp 

Of Autumn on the hills ; 
A scarlet pageant In the swamp ; 

Low lyrics from the rills 
And a rich attar in he air 

That orient morn distils. 

' Again the tapestry of haze 

Of amethystine dye 
Encincturing the horizon ways ; 

And from the middle sky 
The Iterant, reverberant call 

Of wild geese winging by. 

' Agaan the viols of the wind 

Attuned to one soft theme ; — 
Here, every burden left behind, 

O love, would It not seem 
A near approach to paradise 

To dream and dream and dream ! ' 

Mr. Scollard is a very satisfying lyrist as a 
rule; sometimes, when he seems to be reaching 
out for more flexible forms of expression, he is 
not altogether happy, but he is a practised singer, 
and we always find him welcome. 

Mr. Martin Schutze is the author of a slender, 
collection which he has styled ' Crux ^tatis, ' 
from the somewhat obscure sonnet which he 
places on his opening page. He sometimes has a 
touch that suggests Heine, but his verse suffers 



as a rule from unmusical aggregations of voca- 
bles and from a failure to master the niceties of 
English idiom. His qualities, with their defects, 
are clearly shown in these lines from 'The 
Gale': 

' O my beloved, cannot we 

Amid the passionate uproar 
On storm-steep paths of liberty 

One care-free journey fare? 
Can we not one sun's course be free, 

Mid urge and surge of generous dare. 
On racing crests of life to be 

As billows, birds and air? 
Can we not burst the gates of fear. 

Sweep off the bars and crumbling stare 
And lees of yesterday's wisdom drear. 

And wiser-prudency? 
Our thoughts without expedient veer, 

The falter in our voice no more. 
Our hearts no usurers, the sheer 

Storm-joy within the deep soul's core. * 

The struggle for expression is here too obvious, 
the achievement too imperfect, and the faults 
we find exhibited in these lines are of too fre- 
quent occurrence, to make Mr. Schutze 's volume 
more than an experiment with some small 
promise of future i>erformance. 

Mr. W. H. Venable writes lyrics of pedagc^y, 
ballads of Ohio Valley heroism, and occasional 
tributes to the history of the Northwest. There 
is a certain vigor, but not much pretence of 
poetry, about the lines which describe the Great 
Ordinance as 

' A heart, 
A vital and organic part. 
Propelling by its strong pulsation 
The unremitting stream and flood 

Of wholesome inflences that give 
Unto the body politic 
The elements and virtues quick 

Whereby Republics live. ' 

It would be hardly fair, however, to represent 
Mr. Venable by these lines alone, and we supple- 
ment them with a few stanzas from ' Saga of the 
Oak,' the poem which gives a title to the collec- 
tion. 

' Centuries do I stand here 

Thinking thoughts profound and drear. 

Dreaming solemn dreams sublime 

Of the mysteries of time. 

' Roots of mine do feed on graves ; 
I have eaten bones of braves , 
In the ground the learned gnomes 
Read to me their cryptic tomes. 

' Annals treasured in the air 
All the past to me declare , 
Every wind of heaven brings 
Tribute for me on Its wings. 

' I am weary of the years ; 
Overthrown are all my peers. 
Slain by steel or storm or flame, — 
I would perish too — the same. 

' Yet shall I a little space 
Linger still In life's embrace 
Ere metempsychosing time 
Drag me down to Niflhelm. ' 

A string of ineffectual quatrains, imitative of 
the Tent-Maker, yet optimistic in their strain, 
opens Mr. John G. Jmy's 'Omar and Fitzgerald, 
and Other Poems. ' (This misprinting of Fitz- 
Gerald's name is many times repeated.) Mr. 
Jury 's work is commonplace, and decidedly raw in 
spots. It has a moralizing tendency which may

be illustrated by these stanzas from 'Two 
Souls ': 

' Two souls walked on a leaf-strewn way. 

Through fairest woodland scene. 

In varied aisles of gold and green 
Where reigns the Queen of Day. 

One saw but vale and flower and tree, — 

The other, God's serenity. 

' Two souls paused at the gates of night, 

As sank life's sun to rest ; 

One, tearful, looked into the west. 
Till tears obscured his sight; 

Beyond Death's circling shadow bars. 

One read Heaven's promise in the stars. ' 

A set of 'Vignettes' comes at the close of 
this volume. We reproduce two of them, one 
as an illustration of the author's taste, the other 
for a reason different but obvious. 'Joshua' is 
the subject of the first. 

' Didst thou write that fake infernal 
About the sun in Gibeon? — 
The moon in vales of Ajalon? 
If printing were in vogue, 
Bold and designing rogue. 
Thou wouldst have owned a yellow journal. ' 

The subject of the other is 'Caesar.' 

' Proud apex of Rome's towering pile 

That stood for war and strength and lust, — 

Then, crashing like the Campanile 
At Venice, fell — a cloud of dust ! ' 

Another product of the Pacific Coast is the 
volume called 'Shapes of Clay,' into which Mr. 
Ambrose Bierce has brought together the fugi- 
tive verses of many years,— nearly four hundred 
pages of them altogether. Much of this work is 
the merest journalism, and had better have been 
left in obscurity. But Mr. Bierce has been a 
considerable force in "Western letters for many 
years, and his work sometimes reaches a high 
plane of diction and emotion. Even when it does 
not deserve such description, it often has enough 
of the arresting and vigorous quality to keep it 
alive. Some of the pieces fairly match Bret 
Harte in his own peculiar manner, which state- 
ment we may illustrate by quoting from the story 
of a Yorick of the forty-niners. 

' Maybe I knowed you ; seems to me I've seed 
Your face afore. I don't forget a face, 

But names I disremember — I'm that breed 
Of owls. I'm talking some'at into space 

An' maybe my remarks is too derned free 

Seein' yer name is unbeknown to me. 

' Ther' was a time, I reckon, when I knowed 
Nigh onto every dern galoot in town. 

That was as late as '50. Now she's growed 
Surprisin' ! Yes, me an' my pardner, Brown, 

Was wide acquainted. If ther' was a cuss 

We didn't know, the cause was — he knowed us. ' 

By way of contrast to this humorous effusion, 
we will append the poem 'Geotheos,' which 
seems to us the best piece in the collection. 

• As sweet as the look of a lover 
Saluting the eyes of a maid, 
That blossom to blue as the maid 

Is ablush to the glances above her, 
The sunshine is gilding the glade 
And lifting the lark out of shade. 

' Sing therefore high praises, and therefore 
Sing songs that are ancient as gold, 
Of Earth in her garments of gold ; 

Nor ask of their meaning, nor wherefore 
They charm as of yore, for behold. 
The Earth is as fair as of old. 



' Sing songs of the pride of the mountains. 
And songs of the strength of the seas. 
And the fountains that fall to the seas 

From the hands of the hills, and the fountains 
That shine in the temples of trees. 
In valleys of roses and bees. 

' Sing songs that are dreamy and tender 

Of slender Arabian palms, 

And shadows that circle the palms. 
Where caravans, veiled from the splendor. 

Are kneeling in blossoms and balms 

In islands of infinite calms. 

' Barbaric, O Man, was thy runing 

When mountains were stained as with wine 
By the dawning of Time, and as wine 

Were the seas, yet its echoes are crooning, 
Achant in the gusty pine 
And the pulse of the poet's line. ' 

We could wish that the author of such lines as 
these had sufficient restraint to keep himself from 
publishing the cheap witticisms and the unar 
bashed vulgarities which frequently disfigure his 
pages. But we must be sparing of adverse com- 
ment, lest Mr. Bierce apply to us his description, 

'The thoughts unreal which they think they think,' 
which is his neat way of characterizing the judg- 
ments of critics. 

A voice from Tennessee comes to us in the 
'Poems' of Mr. Walter Malone, a volume into 
which the writer has remorselessly brought to- 
gether upwards of two hundred compositions, 
some frankly labelled as 'Juvenile,' and all 
pedestrian and uninspired. 'The critic wonders,' 
he observes,— 

' The critic wonders why the lowly bards 

Still write and write when no one seems to read. 

When fame and fortune still refuse rewards, 

And when the world gives but a wreath of weed. ' 

The apology urged is that 'they have done their 
best,' than which even Shakespeare could do no 
more. Mr. Malone 's best does not seem to dif- 
fer greatly from his worst ; we leave the reader to 
decide which is represented by these stanzas on 
'Dante and Gemma': 

' Surrounded by the dull and commonplace, 
Dante and Gemma lived as man and wife ; 

Year after year they kept the self-same pace. 
Amid the homely scenes of prosy life. 

' Seven children came to romp around their door, 
And give her weary hands more work to do ; 

Without complaint, the burden all she bore, — 
She loved them and their father, Dante, so ! ' 

William Morton Payne.

with the Monocotyledons — the lilies, the 
grasses, the palms, and their kin. The Dicotyle- 
dons are to be presented in Volume II., soon to 
appear. An historical introduction to the gen- 
eral subject makes up the first chapter, and is 
interesting for many reasons. For instance, we 
have here assembled, probably for the first time, 
a succinct and clear comparative outline of the 
principal schemes and systems by which the 
founders of modern botany have sought to ex- 
press their appreciation of the relationships, or 
at least the resemblances, found among the fiow- 
ering plants. The views of Linne, Jussieu, the 
De Candolles, are each and all here presented 
so that any reader may compare and understand 
them. Then again, it is always well to know 
history; we better understand present views 
when we know the route by which they were 
attained. For such reasons we are inclined to 
regard the first chapter as one of the most valua- 
ble in the book. In the further unfolding of his 
subject, our author makes no claim to novelty. 
His classification of the Gymnosperms, both fos- 
sil and recent, follows, in the main, lines already 
familiar to American students. In discussing the 
Monocotyledons, the arrangement given by the 
German scholar, Engler, in the 'Syllabus,' is 
generally adhered to. The book will, we feel 
sure, meet the author's intent, and be useful 
to English readers the world over. The work 
is largely, in the nature of the case, a book of 
names; and our only criticism at this time 
affects the matter of its nomenclature. It is 
true that this is the very particular in which 
naturalists have been unable to agree, and yet 
it would seem that in matters of consistency 
they might all agree. Whatever the system of 
nomenclature preferred, that system should be 
consistent. Co-ordinate groups should be marked 
by common endings. In discussing the Gymnos- 
perms, our author follows this simple rule for 
the names of classes; in Monoctyledons he for- 
gets it. In naming orders he is perfectly arbi- 
trary in all cases. This is a serious defect; con- 
sistency here is essential to clearness both to 
the expert and to the general reader. The book 
is liberally illustrated by wood-cuts, many pre- 
pared especially for this volume. The press-work 
is good, and typographical errors are compara- 
tively few. 

Southern studies It is a significant fact that at 
in Colonial Ittst the history of the South 

history. {^ beginning to be written in a 

scholarly spirit by Southern men. In this treat- 
ment the Carolinas have perhaps had the most 
conspicuous part. To Mr. McCrady's volumes, 
and that of Mr. W. Roy Smith on early South 
Carolina, must now be added Prof. Charles Lee 
Raper's ' North Carolina, a Study in English 
Colonial Government ' (Macmillan). The book 
is first of all commendable because of the large- 
ness of view in which it has been written. It is 
without question, as the author claims, the first 
study from original sources of the whole period 
of the provincial government of North Carolina; 
and no small part of that which is valuable in 
the history of the colony will be found in its 



pages. At the same time, the work is chiefly 
valuable as a study of English colonial adminis- 
tration in the eighteenth century, — a study the 
more valuable because it departs so far from the 
conventional treatment of the affairs and institu- 
tions of the American colonies. After a running 
survey of the proprietary period, which ended 
with the establishment of the crown government 
in 1729, Professor Raper settles himself to a 
keen analysis of the administrative, legislative, 
and judicial systems, as they actually worked 
under the rule of the five royal governors be- 
ginning with Burrington in 1729 and ending with 
Martin in 1775. There are separate chapters on 
the governor's office and functions, the consti- 
tution and powers of the governor's council, the 
privileges of the lower legislative house and its 
relations with the governor and council, the sys- 
tem of land-tenure and land-grants, the fiscal 
administration of the colony, the judicial sys- 
tem with its multiplicity of courts, the arrange- 
ments for local defense, and the circumstances 
attending the downfall of the royal government 
on the eve of the Revolution. Particularly in- 
teresting is a special chapter on the conflicts be- 
tween the executive and the lower house, a chap- 
ter which no one can afford to miss who wishes 
to understand the earlier stages in the develop- 
ment of our country's democracy. Professor 
Raper's method of working is distinctly that of 
the scholar. In the production of his monograph 
he has made use of all the printed and manu- 
script sources available, so that one can feel con- 
fidence in his results. He gives a systematic 
bibliography of his subject, and also many refer- 
ences in foot-notes which should be of value to 
the careful reader. Altogether one may well 
express the wish that the political institutions of 
others of the American colonies. North and 
South, may be treated after the same fashion 
and by as competent a hand. 

An excellent guide-book for those 
Old-time haunts ^^^ ^^j^j^ revive their memories

ments once pressed by their feet, is found in Mr. 
Rufus Rockwell Wilson's ' New England in Let- 
ters,' published, with attractive colored photogra- 
phic plates, by A. Wessels Co. From Portland to 
New Haven the author pursues a zig-zag course, 
giving in a form at once compact and entertain- 
ing, the chief items a literary pilgrim would do 
well to bear in mind. Literary judgments, even 
from the best authorities, are obviously little 
required in such a manual, and might better have 
been omitted. Nor will the reader look for new 
and startling discoveries in following this well- 
worn road ; or if he does he will be disappointed. 
Nearest to novelty, perhaps, is the touching stoi-y 
(embalmed in the poet's ' Memoirs ') of Whit- 
tier's one love affair, his unsuccessful wooing of 
beautiful Cornelia Russ of Hartford. The book s

of omission than of commission. Speaking of Dr.

Bryant's birthplace, Cummington, is grouped 
with Berkshire points of interest in such a way 
as to lead the uninformed to look for it in the 
wrong county. Further bewilderment may be 
caused by the statement that the site of the house 
where he was born * is not in Cummington, but 
about a mile away,' when nothing more is meant 
than that it is not in the immediate village. 
Worcester is dismissed with scant notice, the 
writer appearing to be in haste to catch the 
train for Springfield. Why Brownson, who was 
successively a Presbyterian, a Universalist, a 

•Unitarian, and a Roman Catholic, should be 
described as * a man who would have warmed the 
hearts of Cromwell and his Ironsides,' is not 
apparent, — except that he was a man of positive 
though changeable opinions, and a giver and 
receiver of hard blows. Like many writers of 
greater fame, Mr. Wilson has his pet phrases, 
one of which is * burial garth.' A few verbal 
blemishes that mar his pages are the more vexa- 
tious because they could so easily have been 
removed. Lyman Beecher is called * neither a 
profound scholar or an exact thinker.' ' To 
gleefully relate to their mutual friends ' will give 
double offense to purists. 

The atirrina life If Richard Boyle, first Earl of 
of the Oreat Earl Cork, had lived three hundred 
of Cork. years later, he would have pushed 

his fortunes in South Africa or the Klondyke, 
and would have been widely known as a colon- 
izer of new territory and a captain of industry. 
Today, although his seventh son (and four- 
teenth child) Robert, the philosopher and the 
founder of the Boyle Lectures, is well remem- 
bered, his own name is familiar to comparatively 
few, notwithstanding that he played a part as 
conspicuous in the world's eyes as that of Cecil 
Rhodes three centuries later. Bom of poor par- 
ents and early compelled to shift for himself, 
Richard Boyle went at twenty-two to Ireland, 
then virgin soil to the English, and there rose to 
wealth and fame by as varied and exciting and 
romantic a career as can be found in history. 
Bold of spirit and alert to his very finger-tips, he 
did indeed, to use his biographer's somewhat 
novel expression * catch Dame Fortune by the 
forelock. ' He died full of years and honors, in 
1644, and with him, his panegyrist assures us, 

* passed away the old orders, the Elizabethan age 
in Munster, and the old glorious days when a 
man would dare the impossible, confident in him- 
self, in England, and in his God.' In Miss Doro- 
thea Townshend's * Life and Letters of the Great 
Earl of Cork ' (Dutton) is presented a full and 
painstaking account of this stirring life of one 
whom his enemies called a political adventurer, 
but whose achievements under hard conditions in 
a raw and turbulent country must command the 
admiration of all. Additional interest is given 

^ to his life by the descent from him of many well- 
known members of the English nobility and gen- 
try, and also by his acquaintance with the poet 



Spenser, who married a cousin of his, Elizabeth 
Boyle. His biographer has been fortunate in hav- 
ing an ample store of material to draw from in 
the shape of original sources. The Earl's diary, 
— to mention no other papers, — presents a full 
record of his life from 1611 to his death, and 
fills five volumes in its printed form. Miss 
Townshend's large and well-illustrated octavo of 
over five hundred pages preserves, along with the 
eulogistic accompaniments to be expected in a 
sympathetic biography, all that we of to-day need 
to know about Richard Boyle, his manifold polit- 
ical, military, and industrial activities, his fam- 
ily and his associates. 

An unannounced and unexpected 
^thfB^ians volume in the series of ' Our 

European Neighbors ' (Putnam) 
makes its appearance under the title of * Bel- 
gian Life in Town and Country,' by Mr. Dem- 
etrius C. Boulger. Belgium is generally less 
known than other European nations, and much 
information about it is here carefully collated. 
As a constitutional monarchy, Belgium dates 
only from 1830; but the territory it occupies, 
though not large, is of deep historic interest. 
It comprises among its cities Antwerp, Ghent, 
Brussels, Louvain, and the three so-called ' dead 
cities of Flanders ' — Bruges, Courtrai, and 
Ypres. Small as the country is, it has in its 
population two distinct races, the Walloons and 
Flemings ; and these speak two languages, French 
and Flemish. It is but a small contingent of the 
first-named race that speaks the old ' Romance ' 
dialect known as Walloon, and the number of 
German-speaking Belgians living in the border 
provinces is insignificant. Though the Wal- 
loons and Flemings maintain their separate 
racial characteristics, they are held together 
chiefly by their religion; and Belgium is 
one of the three most devoted countries 
of the Church of Rome, Bavaria and Ire- 
land being the other two. It makes a 
respectable showing among the nations of 
Europe in the arts and sciences; and it has of 
late years produced at least one writer of world- 
wide reputation, Maeterlinck. Its manufactur- 
ing centres, and its coal-mining district of the 
Borinage, present interesting studies in economic 
and social conditions. All this, with its recently 
developed ambition for colonial enterprises in 
Africa, furnishes abundant material for an inter- 
esting volume, and Mr. Boulger has made use of 
this material with happy results. 

AnewUfe The admirable series of the

the Great. nam) contains no biography of 

more solid worth, and few of more absorbing 
interest, than Mr. W. F. Reddaway's ' Fred-

career of that remarkable character is sketched

rhymester, the hard-headed, unscrupulous man of 
action, the pitiless tyrant, and the great soldier 
whose victories startled the world although he 
brought many disasters upon his armies by his 
foolish decisions at critical times; the marvellous 
attention to details that looked after the mean- 
est and the pettiest matters in the life of his 
people, whether nobles or peasants; the unmiti- 
gated despotism that he established, which only 
a succession of Fredericks could have made suc- 
cessful, and which he would not modify although 
he knew that his successor was to be a fool; 
these and many other aspects of the famous 
monarch are clearly set forth by Mr. Reddaway. 
That Frederick had in him neither honor nor 
religion, nor any fineness of spirit, seems to be 
the fact; yet through him came the aggrandize- 
ment of Prussia that has made modern Germany 
possible, and although he is not the kind of 
hero that many writers have made him out to 
be, he was a great force in bringing about mod- 
ern conditions in Europe.

oid landmarks manizing, now going on in Lon- 
of London ^^^^ furnishes the occasion for 

Mr. Charles Gordon's book on ' Old-Time Ald- 
wyeh, Kingsway, and Neighborhood ' (Dutton). 
As the culmination of projects dating from 1836, 
an avenue ninety feet wide and to bear the name 
of Kingsway, and a semi-circular street of equal 
width to bear the old Danish name of Aldwych, 
are being constructed in one of the most con- 
gested portions of old London, to connect High 
Holbom Street with the Strand. As the work 
progresses, many famous literary and historical 
landmarks disappear; and Mr. Gordon, who has 
already written of ' The Old Bailey and New- 
gate,' having collected all the antiquarian lore 
of the neighborhood, writes it up as entertain- 
ingly as an antiquary can reasonably be expected 
to do. He furnishes nothing especially new in 
what he writes of the old; in fact, his book, 
after devoting four chapters to the documentary 
history of the improvements, taken largely from 
the minutes of municipal proceedings, is princi- 
pally made up of quotations from Strype, Stowe, 
Maitland, Malcolm, Oldys, John Timbs, and oth- 
ers who are the commonly accepted authorities 
on Old London. The value of his work consists 
chiefly in his collation of descriptions and illus- 
trations of the portion of London in the neigh- 
borhood of Lincoln Inn, St. Martin in the Fields, 
St. Clement Danes, and St. Mary le Strand, in 
order that they may be accessible to the students 
of the generations to come. 

Concerning the Professor Woodward, of the Uni- 
Aim and Method versity of Liverpool, has added 
ot Education. ^^ j^jg studies dealing with the 
pedagogical theory of the Renaissance, a new 
volume, * Desiderius Erasmus Concerning the 
Aim and Method of Education ' (Macmillan). 
The ground-plan so successfully employed in the 
author's previous volume on Vittirino da Feltre 
is followed here. First, we have a thirty-page 



sketch of the life of Erasmus; next, more than 
a hundred pages of careful analyses of his edu- 
cational doctrine, section by section; and finally 
a translation of those writings of Erasmus which 
treat most directly of Education. A careful 
bibliography is appended. Treating as it does 
of much the same subject-matter as the earlier 
volume, and by the same method, there is inevi- 
tably a certain loss of freshness and interest in 
the present work. It is true that the author 
brings out clearly the essential service of Eras- 
mus in adapting the humanistic ideals to the 
sterner moral and religious conditions of North- 
ern Europe; his views on many points, however, 
are but pale reflections of the much more vital 
ideas of the Italian thinkers of the Quattrocento. 
Professor Woodward is a careful scholar and an 
excellent writer. A book in this field has been 
long needed, inasmuch as the treatment of Eras- 
mus in the shorter histories of education has 
been vague and unsatisfactory in the extreme. 

An addition to the number of 
notable rug books of recent years 
is Mary Beach Langton's inter- 
esting and useful handbook, * How to Know Ori- 
ental Rugs ' (Appleton), which puts within 
reach of the general reader much information 
usually obtainable only in rare and expensive 
works. The first chapter gives a general survey 
of the subject and a description of the weaving 
process. A chapter is devoted to each of the 
distinctive characteristics of Persian, Caucasian, 
Kurdistan, Turkish, Turkonian, Indian, Chinese, 
and silk rugs. A brief description of the dis- 
tricts where rugs are woven will interest many 
rug-lovers to whom Saraband and Cashmere and 
Bokhara are merely technical names. The book 
shows painstaking investigation, and is clearly 
and concisely written. It is a relief not to find here 
the mass of confusing detail which makes many 
handicraft books wearisome, and the writer's 
enthusiasm cannot fail to interest the general 
reader as well as the rug collector. The full- 
page colored illustrations, from actual rugs 
owned in the United States, are a valuable fea- 
ture of the work.

This volume is described as a more elaborate and

ese.

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



The September publications of Messrs. A. C. 
McClurg & Co. will include a reprint of ' Gass's 
Journal of the Lewis and Clark Eixpedition,' edited 
by Dr. James K. Hosmer; ' Farmington,' by Mr. 
Clarence S. Darrow, being memories of boyhood in 
a Pennsylvania village; 'A Short History of Ore- 
gon,' compiled by Sidona B. Johnson; 'A History of 
Negro Servitude in Illinois and of the Slavery 
^ Agitation in that State,' by Prof. N, Dwight Har- 
ris; ' In Search of the Okapi,' a story of 
adventure in Central Africa, by Mr. Ernest Glan- 
ville; and ' The Wandering Twins,' dealing with 
the life of two children in Labrador, by Mrs. Mary 
Bourchier Sanford. 

The substance of Mr. Richard Le Gallienne's 
•How to Get the Best Out of Books' (Baker-Tay- 
lor Co.) is comprised in the injunction, ' Read what 
you like and when you like. Do not be overawed by 
any book because it bears the name of a classic, 
or discouraged as to your possibilities of literary 
appreciation, if you do not happen to like it.' 
This has all been said so many times as to seem 
a trifle commonplace; and the same is substan- 
tially true of the other essays in the volume, on 
such subjects as ' What We Look for in Books,' 
' What an Unread Man Should Read,' and ' How 
to Form a Library.' The chapter on ' The Novel 
and Novelists of To-day' is the most interesting 
of the collection. 

The Putnams have in preparation for the com- 
ing season a new illustrated series entitled 
' French Classics for English Readers,' to be edited 
by Professor Adolphe Cohn, L.L.B., and Dr. Cur- 
tis Hidden Page. The design of the series is to 
meet the need of the many who are interested in 
French literature, and desire to know it directly, 
but who cannot easily read its authors in the 
original. Six volumes are in immediate prepara- 
tion, as follows: one volume each of Rabelais, 
Montaigne, Beaumarchais, and George Sand, and 
two volumes of Moli^re. Each work will be intro- 
duced with a biographical and critical essay by an 
authority, giving an adequate account of the 
author's life, writings, and place in literary his- 
tory.

The Fall Books of 1904 

A NOTABLE EXHIBIT of the activities and prospects of the American Publishing 
Trade at the opening of the season of 1904 will be presented in The Dial's annual 
Fall Announcement Number, to appear, as usual, on September 16. In the regular 
classified " List of Books Announced for Fall Publication," and in the advertising pages 
of this issue, will be found full advance information regarding all the important new books 
in preparation for the coming season. The Dial's Announcement lists have for many 
years been recognized as the most accurate and useful prepared by any periodical, and the 
issues containing them are relied upon very generally by the retail trade, librarians, and pri- 
vate buyers of books, in making up advance order-lists and planning future book purchases. 
The Fall Announcement Number is therefore one of the most important and desirable book 
advertising mediums of the year.

The Trail of Lewis and Clark 

Was the pioneer American trail west of the Missouri river, and the results of that exploration of 1804-6 
were of tremendous importance to the United States, and they were never more apparent than now. 

A publication relating to the Lewis and Clark expedition, just issued by Q. P. Putnam's Sons, 
New York, stands peculiarly alone. This edition is a two volume, 8vo one, called ♦♦ The Trail of 
Lewis and Clark, 1804-1904." The author, Mr. Olin D. Wheeler, is the well known writer of 
the popular Wonderland series of the Northern Pacific Railway, in connection with which he made his 
studies and researches for this work. 

Mr. Wheeler has travelled several thousand miles over the route of Lewis and Clark. He has 
camped out, climbed mountains, followed old Indian trails, and visited remote points made memorable by 
those explorers. Their route across the Bitterroot mountains has been followed, identified, and mapped. 

"The Trail of Lewis and Clark" is illustrated in color and half tone from paintings, 
drawings, and maps, by Paxson, DeCamp, and Russell, made under Mr. Wheeler's direction, and from 
photographs taken specially for the purpose. The writer tells his own story, and supplements it with 
pertinent extracts from Lewis and Clark, and a host of other historical and narrative writers that connect 
the past with the present. Exact experts and photographic reproductions, in half-tone, from the 
ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPT JOURNALS of Lewis and Clark are given. A chapter is devoted to 
the Louisiana Purchase, another to the preparatory measm-es for the exploration, and another to the 
history of each man of the expedition so far as known, including a discussion of the death of Captain 
Lewis. 

The Louisiana Purchase Exposition at St. Louis, and the Lewis and Clark Centennial 
to be held at Portland, Oregon, in 1905, make this work peculiarly timely because wi-itten from the 
standpoint of actual knowledge of past and present conditions of the old trail and country. 

"The Trail of Lewis and Clark" should be found in every public and private library in the 
land, and the general reader will find in reading through its pages of large, clear type that truth is, 
indeed, stranger than fiction. 

The book can be ordered through any bookseller or news stand, or direct from the publishers.

The Gospel and the Church 



-'1 



By ABBE ALFRED LOISY 

12mo. $1.00 net. 

This work, which created a sensation throughout the Catholic world when it first appeared in France, is a positive 
statement of Christian doctrine by one of the most able and accomplished leaders in the movement for greater 
freedom of thought and action in the French Catholic Church. "It has in an eminent degree," says the Quarterly 
Review, " what Newman's famous ' Essay on Development ' had not — the judicial temper. Free from sophistry 
and special pleading, the Catholicism that inspires it is hereditary and religious, not political." 



The Ethical Teaching of Jesus 

By CHARLES A. BRIGGS, D.D. 

12mo. $1.00 net. Postage 12 cents. 

This work is the result of inductive study of the teaching of Jesus. He finds that the fundamental principle of the 
ethics of Jesus is voluntary love, a love which transcends the category of law in the liberty of divine sonahip.

Coming Within the Next Four Weeks 



History of Andrew Jackson 

By AUGUSTUS C. BUELL 

Author of " Paul Jones, Founder of the American Navy." In two 8vo volumes, with portraits, plan, etc. 

$4.00 net. Postage extra. 
In his personality and career Jackson made the same strong appeal to the biographer that Paul Jones had made a 
dozen years earlier. He ransacked old records, old books, diaries, letter-files and what not in the search for material, 
throwing new light upon Jackson's life and, as in the case of the " Paul Jones," arranged this material and wrote the 
work con amore. Mr. Buell has made a striking full-length portrait of one of the greatest leaders of men who ever lived 
— a figure which for rugged, native strength and winning, popular qualities is perhaps unmatched in American history. 

The Temper of the 1 7th Century in English Literature 

(Clark Lectures at Trinity College, Cambridge, 1902-1903) 

By BARRETT WENDELL, Professor of English at Harvard University 

12 mo. $2.00 net. Postage extra. 

Elizabethan Literature — The Disintegration of the Drama — The Decline of Poetry — The Divergent Masters of Lyric 

Poetry — The Disintegration of English Poetry — The Development of Prose — Puritanism — Milton — The Age of Dryden. 

Music and Other Poems 

By HENRY VAN DYKE, Author of "The Toiling Felix," "The Builders," etc. 

$1.00 net. Postage 10 cents. 
This volume (opening with w^hat perhaps is the finest and most elevated of his sustained poems, the " Ode to Music ") 
collects the lyrical and other verse which, for some years past, has been establishing Dr. Henry van Dyke's high place 
among American poets. Many pieces here included have already, even in their fugitive publication, gone far toward 
securing the permanent position which this collection will give them, and their appearance together will emphasize the 
fact that Dr. van Dyke has but few companions in the qualities that distinguish his verse and make it remembered. 



Monarch, the Big Bear of Folac 

By ERNEST THOMPSON SETON 

Nearly a hundred illustrations printed in two colors. 

$1.25 net. Postage 12 cents. 

This story is one of the most intimate animal studies, as 
well as one of the most thrilling stories, Mr. Seton has 
ever written. It is a return, in kind, to his earlier man- 
ner, that of the tales in his " Wild Animals I Have 
Known." It is his longest animal story, and is illus- 
trated with nearly a hundred of his marginal line draw- 
ings, beside many full pages in half-tone. 



Our Big Game 

By DWIGHT W. HUNTINGTON 
With 16 full-page illustrations of wild animals. 
8vo. $2.00 net. Postage 16 cents. 
The cordial reception which the public gave to Mr. 
Huntington's " Our Feathered Game " has led to the 
preparation of a complementary volume, carried out on 
the same lines and dealing with " Our Big Game " from 
the point of view of the sportsman who is also a lover of 
nature. The work is divided into four books treating 
respectively, of the individual members of the Deer Fam- 
ily, the Ox Family, the Bear Family, and the Cat Family. 



Fetichism in West Africa 

Forty Years' Observation of Native Customs and Superstitions 

By ROBERT HAMILL NASSAU, M.D., S.T.D. 

With 12 full-page illustrations. $2.50 net. Postage extra. 

In the routine of mission life, in canoe by day and in camp and hut by night, the author has penetrated to the 
innermost depth of native thought and has gathered hitherto unknown information about the most secret practices 
of Fetichdom. The result of his observations here brought together constitutes an invaluable addition to ethno- 
logical literature and is a most entertaining narrative.

Reprinted from the Edition of i8ii,with an Introduction by Dr. James K. Hosmer, an analytical 
Index, facsimiles of the original illustrations, a rare portrait of Patrick Gass, and a map of the 
Lewis and Clark route. 

The appearance of this volume in the year of Lewis and Clark celebrations is especially pertinent, as no practi- 
cal library edition has been available of the "Journal of Patrick Gass." The work originally appeared in 1807, and 
ran through three editions, the third dated 1 8 1 1, but no reprint has been made since the somewhat crude edition pub- 
lished at Dayton, Ohio, in 1847, which has, of course, long been out of print. In one octavo volume, boxed, $3.50 net.

Reuben Gold Thwaites, LL.D., a Bibliography by Victor Hugo Paltsits, facsimiles of 
original title-pages, and twenty-four maps, and illustrations. 
The selection of the famous writings of Baron Lahontan for republication is a natural one after the success of the 

reprint of Hennepin issued in 1903. It is a logical step in the preparation of the Americana series planned by Messrs. 

McClurg& Co., and the appearance of Lahontan's Voyages in a standard library edition will be as welcome as that of 

the preceding volumes. Like the Hennepin, it is a word-for-word reprint. In two 8vo volumes, boxed, $6. net.

Exact Reprint of the Second Issue of 1698. With Introduction, Notes, and analytical Index by 

Reuben Gold Thwaites, LL.D., a Bibliography by Victor Hugo Paltsits, facsimiles of 

the seven full-page illustrations, and two large folding maps. 

This particular book by Father Hennepin is generally considered the most representative product of his pen, and 
as a human document it has few rivals in our literature. Moreover, it is the only one of the Hennepin books now 
upon the market. In two octavo volumes, boxed, $6.00 net. 

Large-paper edition {limited), on Bro'wn's hand-made paper, illustrations on Japan paper, $18.00 net. 

"None of the many recent reprints of Americana is of greater importance to collectors and students than the 
re-issue of Father Louis Hennepin's 'New Discovery of a Vast Country in America.' . . . Mechanically, the book 
is superbly produced, and it seems to us to be the best made book, in every particular, that has been offered the 
trade during the current season." — Chicago E'vening Post. 

"It should be a subject of rejoicing among those of our citizens who cherish the past, that Dr. Thwaites and 
his publishers have given us these two beautiful and scholarly volumes — a presentment which leaves nothing more 
to be desired." — Minneapolis Times.

My Lady of the North 

The Love Story of a Gray- Jacket. By Randall Parrish, author of "When Wilderness Was 
King." Four illustrations in color by E. M. Ashe. i2mo, 350 pages. ;^i.50. 
Mr. Parrish's first novel, "When Wilderness Was King," which was published in the spring, became one ot 
the real successes of the summer. A second romance which can be recommended as actually better than the first 
will be awaited with much interested expectation by the countless numbers who appreciate a good story. The plot 
is concerned with the adventures of a Southern cavalry captain during the closing months of the war, and besides 
being tremendously exciting contains a love episode of most unusual charm. 

Farmington 

Memories of a Boyhood in a Pennsylvania Village. By Clarence S. Darrow. i2nio, gilt top, 
300 pages. ;^i.50. 

Around the recollections of his boyhood in a Pennsylvania village Mr. Darrow has created an atmosphere of 
most delicate imagination and whimsical humor, told in a manner which makes an irresistible appeal to the reader 
whose memories turn readily to his own childhood. It would be difficult to state when the indefinable illusion that 
surrounds such recollections has been more successfully put into a book. Mr. William Dean Howells, who read 
the manuscript, expressed himself in no uncertain terms as to its merits, going so far as to say that " it belongs with 
Tolstoi's 'Childhood, Boyhood, and Youth'." Mr. Darrow's book will come as a great surprise to many who 
think of him only as a successful lawyer and an active figure in turbulent political life. 

Florence in the Poetry of the Brownings 

A Selection of the Poems of Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning dealing with Florence, its Art 
and History. Edited, with an Introduction, by Anna B. McMahan. With sixty-five full- 
page illustrations from photographs. i2mo, gilt top, 240 pages, indexed. $1.40 net. 
This beautiful example of bookmaking makes its appeal to lovers of Florence, to lovers of art, and to lovers 
of Browning. The first will be ready to admit that never has the wonderful city been so glorified as in the more 
famous Browning poems, the second will be glad to have such a representative collection of fine reproductions of 
both painting and sculpture, and surely the Browning lovers will appreciate so appropriately illustrated a selection 
which includes "Casa Guidi Windows," «<The Dance," " The Statue and the Bust," Book I. of " The Ring 
and the Book," and several others.

A Series of Popular Biographical Romances, Translated from the German by George P. Upton, 
translator of "Memories." Each story in one volume, with four illustrations, square i6mo, 
1 20 pages, 60 cts. net. 
First volumes: BEETHOVEN MOZART MAID OF ORLEANS WILLIAM TELL 

These first volumes represent a plan to inaugurate in this country a series similar to the " Jugendbibliothek " so 
popular in Germany, where a special point is made of providing wholesome literature, founded on history, for 
children. In America there is no such "Youth's Library," and the publishers believe there is little doubt that 
such a series, at low prices, will prove extremely popular. Four volumes will be brought out this Fall, and if the 
idea meets with the favor expected, the series will be indefinitely continued. These little books have been household 
treasures in Germany for many years, and they will be equally welcome to American boys and girls, as well as to 
some older readers. 



In Search of the Okapi 



A Story of Adventure in Central Africa. By Ernest Glanville, author of "The Diamond 
Seekers," etc. With eight full-page illustrations by William Rainey. Uniform with the 
"Henty Books." iimo, colored edges, 381 pages. $1.50. 

Mr. Glanville' s heroes, two school chums, join an African trader and hunter in an expedition into the unex- 
plored reaches of the vast central forest which the Okapi inhabits. Their adventures in the unknown wilds, including 
encounters with lions, Arabs, and wild men of the woods, are many and exciting. How they hear of the wonderful 
Valley of Rest, how they make their way into it, and how they get out again, is told in a manner that will stamp 
Mr. Glanville as the legitimate successor of the late G. A. Henty. 



The Wandering Twins 



The Adventures of Two Children in Labrador. By Mary Bourchier Sanford. With eight 

full-page illustrations by H. C. Ireland. i6mo, 300 pages. $1.2^. 

A capital story for boys and girls, who cannot help being interested in the adventures that befall Ivan and Ulrica 
Dundas during their search for their father. Their ship lands them at a little fishing settlement in Labrador, and 
there they are obliged to make their own living as best they can, and at the same time follow up the very slight 
clew they have of the whereabouts of their father. The story tells of the hardships of the children in their efforts, 
and there are descriptions of cod fishing, seal catching, and an attempted exploration of the interior, and of course 
everything comes out all right in the end.

NANCY STAI R 

A NEW NOVEL 
by the Author of "Mills of God" 

ELINOR MACARTNEY LANE 

Frontispiece by Sara N. Bartle 
Cloth. $1.50. 



•' Nancy is a most bewitching heroine aa child and woman, 
and the author makes her live with a sense of palpitating 
reality that takes her out of the written page into the 
heart." — HarperU Weekly. 

"With the possible exception of Diana Vernon in 'Rob 
Roy ' we recall no character in the whole realm of fiction 
who is quite worthy of comparison with this adorable, 
spoiled, magnificent maid, Nancy Stair." — Vogtte. 

" ' Nancy Stair ' must be counted among the genuine 
successes of fiction of the last twenty years or so." — New 
York Evening Mail. 



" ' Nancy Stair ' is certainly one of the best novels of the 
season. It is original in theme and treatment, dramatic 
in plot, delightful in style, and satisfactory in denouement. 
It grasps one's interest from the start and holds it with 
increasing intensity to the last page." — Chicago Record- 
Herald. 

" Few more charming stories than ' Nancy Stair ' erer 
came from the pen of a writer." — Baltimore Herald. 
"A beguiling heroine is Nancy. Sweet, accomplished, 
brought up among men to be independent and courageous, 
she finds her true strength in woman's weakness." — Netv 
York Tribune. 



DOROTHEA 

A NEW NOVEL by 

MAARTEN MAARTENS 



Author of " God's Fool," " Joost Avelingh," etc. 



Cloth. ^$1.50. 



" Mr. Maartens deals with real people, moving in real places, swayed 
by their true characters. He is no pessimist and no optimist. He 
sees life whole, and he sees it clearly." — St. 'James Gazette., London. 

" The book is not one to be read hastily or superficially. There are 
a great number of characters, and they are all living, breathing, think- 
ing men and women, stimulating in their contrast to the sawdust puppets 
of so much of our contemporary fiction. Mr. Maartens writes from 
the viewpoint at once of humorist, philosopher, and man of the world. 
He does not pelt us with laboriously prepared epigrams, but a quietly 
wholesome humor sparkles in all his dialogue. His, in short, is a story 
to enjoy in leisurely fashion and be grateful for." — New York Sun.

NEW AUTUMN FICTION 



A Ladder of Swords 



By GILBERT PARKER 

Author of ''The Right of Way," etc. 
In wholly difterent vein from the author's last novel, "The Right of Way," comes this exquisite romance, 
delightful in conception, swift and compelling in interest, and written in the finished style of this great 
novelist. The story recounts the love of two Huguenot refugees, their fugitive life on the Island of Jersey 
in the British Channel. Later the scene changes to England, where exciting intrigue and startling situations 
in the palace of Queen Elizabeth result in repeated dangers for the faithful lovers, but they finally escape 
the hazardous favor of the great queen and are united. The scenes on the Island of Jersey are of idyllic 
freshness and beauty, and in the Seigneur of Rozel, the lord of the island, the author has produced a character 
of delightful humor and braggadocio. It is a thoroughly rounded, satisfying story, written with brilliancy 
and charm of style. Illustrated by the Kinneys. Post S'vo, cloth, $1.^0. 

Vergilius 

A TALE OF THE COMING OF CHRIST 

By IRVING BACHELLER 

Author of '' Ebeti Holden," etc. 

After two years' work along new lines, Irving Bacheller has produced in "Vergilius" a story of new 
atmosphere and unusual power. The scenes are those of ancient Rome in the days of Augustus Caesar, 
and of Palestine under the dark rule of Herod on the eve of the Nativity. The hero and heroine are Roman 
lovers of patrician birth, and their love stands out in sharp contrast to the effeminacy, luxury, and license 
of the Roman life about them. The story is one of tender aft'ection and strong situations, and the final 
scene is a crowning touch of rare beauty. Post S<vo, cloth, $1-3$. 



The Georgians 



By WILL N. HARBEN 

Author of " Abner Daniel,'" etc. 

The scene of Mr. Harben's new novel is that of " Abner Daniel," and Abner is the chief character. The 
story deals with the troubles of two lovers. The girl's father disapproves of her infatuation and endeavors 
to separate the lovers, but Abner, with generous impulse, ingeniously brings them together. Abner, with 
his shrewd humor, pervades the whole story, which is the strongest story of Georgian life Mr. Harben has 
written. Post S'vo, cloth, S^-JO. 

The Lady of Loyalty House 

By JUSTIN HUNTLY McCARTHY 

Author of ''If I Were King," "The Proud Prince." 
A delightful romance of the days of the great Civil War in England. An attempt on the part of a small 
body of Parliamentary volunteers to capture Harby Hall ends by leaving the Puritan leader a prisoner in 
Lady Harby' s hands. From this point the story becomes a tale of love that proves greater than the claims 
of warring factions. The book will find a welcome among all lovers of romance. Post S'vo, cloth, S^S^- 



Nostromo 



By JOSEPH CONRAD 

A novel of present-day adventure in a South American republic. The story is one of revolution and 
exciting intrigue, and throughout the author's marvellous powers of description are shown. The odd 
contrast of mediaeval revolutionary conditions side by side with gigantic commercial enterprises undertaken by 
foreign capital is set forth. Post Svo, cloth, SJ^-JO.

JOSEPHINE By ELLEN DOUGLAS DELAND 

Josephine and her little sister go to live with an uncle in the East. He has three boys of his own, and is 
somewhat dubious at the prospect of adding two more to his family, for the names — "Jo" and " Georgie " 
— naturally lead him to think the newcomers are boys. Naturally, when the two girls arrive, their 
appearance causes some consternation, but they win their way into everyone's heart, and everything comes 
out all right.

The Grafters 

By FRANCIS LYNDE 

Illustrated by Arthur I. Keller. 

The story of a governor who looted his state, stole a railroad out- 
right, and was brought to justice by a man in love. 

"One of the best examples of a new and distinctly American class of fiction — 

the kind which finds romance and even sensational excitement in politics, business, 

finance and law." — The Outlook. 

" Taken by and long, The Grafters shoidd please more American readers than any 

book of the year." — Life. 

" Political novels come and go ; but this is the one to be preferred above all others ; 

to stand the tests of criticism and time ; and to crown the author with well-earned 

fame." — Albany Times-Union.

The Castaway 

By HALLIE ERMINIE RIVES 

Illustrated in color by Howard Chandler Christy 

The Castaway takes its title from a saying of Lord Byron's : " Three great men 
ruined in one year — a king, a cad, and a castaway." The king was Napoleon ; 
the cad was Beau Brummell ; and the castaway — crowned with genius, illumined 
with fam3, and shadowed in infamy — Lord Byron himself. " My life," said 
Byron in another place, " will furnish material for a pretty little romance, which 
shall be denominated the loves of Lord B." His jesting prophecy has been more 
than fulfilled by Miss Rives. Poet, lover, fighter, — what a figure of a man, and 
what a hero of romance ! 

" Dramatic scenes, thrilling incidents, strenuous events follow one another ; pathos, 
revenge and passion; happy scenes; moments of peace and pure happiness; a 
strong love ; and through all these, under all these, is the poet, the man, George 
Gordon." — Grand Rapids Herald.

Hampden Scarborough, the hero, sweeps a political convention off

" It teaches to the most casual reader the great lesson that Americans of the present 
generation need so sorely : that the cause of the people is the great cause in the 
United States, and not the growth of an inordinately wealthy class." 

Wallace Rice in Chicago JExaminer. 
"The story is fiill of the virile impulse. It treats of men of hardy endeavor, 
battling for leadership in the world of commerce and politics. If you want a 
novel that is intensely modern and intensely full of speed and spirit you have it in 
The Cost." Bailey Millard in San Francisco Examiner.

BOOKS OF THE COMING YEAR. 

Once more the publishers have sent out their 
lists of books to be issued during the fall and 
winter season now beginning, and once more 
from these lists (printed complete elsewhere in 
the present number) we attempt a brief survey 
of their more striking features, indicating a few 
of the titles that seem to offer the promise 
of exceptional interest and importance. This 
bird's-eye view is confined, as heretofore, to a 
few categories only; for the most part, to the 
sections of history and biography, poetry and 
fiction, and the history and criticism of litera- 
ture. 

The book of the year — when any one book 
may fairly be thus designated — -is more likely to 
be found in the section of biography and memoirs 
than anywhere else. The coming year offers 
many works of this class that cannot fail to 
prove deeply interesting, although none seems to 
have quite the importance of Morle/s Gladstone 
or Spencer's Autobiography — to mention two 
conspicuous works of the year recently past. 
We are inclined to think that the promised 
'Autobiography, Memories, and Experiences' of 
Mr. Moncure D. Conway will turn out to be the 
most valuable publication of the season in this 
department; certainly it will have the deepest 
sort of interest for American readers. Mr. Con- 
way is one of the few surviving members of the 
group of writers and thinkers whose work 
embodies the finest traditions of our national 
development, and, although he has spent many 
years abroad, he has never ceased to be one of 
us in spirit, or to hold courageously to the older 
ideals of character and conduct that now seem 
in danger of becoming obsolete factors in our 
life. The only other work likely to vie in per- 
sonal interest with Mr. Conway's Autobiog- 
raphy will be the collection of letters written 
by John Euskin to Mr. Charles Eliot Norton. 
Tbese we have already been permitted to read, 
in part, through the medium of ' The Atlantic 
Monthly,' and they reveal the lovable person- 
ality of the writer more clearly than it has ever 
before been shown to us. Other important 
works of biography include the ' EecoUections 
and Letters of General Lee,' Admiral Schley's 
Torty-Five Years under the Flag.' 'An Irish- 
man's Stoiy,' by Mr. Justin McCarthy, the 'Life 
and Letters of Mandell Creighton,' a new mem- 
oir of Aubrey de Vere, and Alfred Vizetelly's 
life of Zola. A series of ' French Men of Let- 
ters,' which we trust may have better luck thftn 



156 



THE DIAIi 



[Sept. 16, 



the one started some years ago, will begin most 
auspiciously with a volume on Balzac by M. 
Brunetiere. 

The approaching completion of three full cen- 
turies of England in the New World seems to 
be stimulating the production of a number of 
American histories on a large scale. Two new 
works of this character appear in our present 
list. One is by Dr. Edward Channing, in an 
unspecified number of volumes, and the other, 
in ten volumes, is by Messrs. W. E. Chancellor 
and F. W. Hewes. Both of these works should 
prove important additions to our apparatus for 
the furtherance of historical information. In 
this connection we should also mention the 
extraordinary recent activity, which shows no 
signs of abatement, in the reprinting, under 
careful editorial supervision, of diocumentary 
matter relating to our early history. Among 
the more ambitious new enterprises of this sort 
we may call attention to the promised editions 
of Cartier, of Lahontan's ' New Voyages,' of 
Gass's ' Journal,' and of the ' Early Western 
Travels' series. Of history other than Ameri- 
can, we find promised fewer important works 
than nsual, and none that deserves to be singled 
out for special mention. 

The section of literary history and criticism 
offers many items of interest, although none of 
first-rate importance. We note with pleasure 
the volumes of essays announced by Mr. Bliss 
Perry, Mr. H. W. Boynton, and Mr. Paul Elmer 
More. The essay in this country would be in a 
bad way were it not for ' The Atlantic Monthly,' 
and without the encouragement of that maga- 
zine these three volumes, in particular, might 
never have been written. Other volumes of 
essays are Mr. Brander Matthews's ' Recreations 
of an Anthologist,' ' Literary Leaders of Amer- 
ica ' by Mr. Richard Burton, ' Lectures and 
Essays' by the late Canon Ainger, and ^Rou- 
tine and ideals ' by Mr. LeBaron R. Briggs. 
Among works having a greater unity of content 
we note ' The Italian Poets since Dante,' by Dr. 
William Everett; 'The Temper of the Seven- 
teenth Century in English Literature,' by Pro- 
fessor Barrett Wendell ; ' The Principles and 
Progress of English Poetry,' by Messrs. C. M. 
Gayley and C. C. Young ; * Lectures on Greek 
Literature,' by Mr. S. H. Butcher ; and ' Rus- 
sian Literature,' by Prince Kropotkin. The 
* Wampum Library of American Literature,' 
edited by Mr. Brander Matthews, is a new enter- 
prise of which three volumes are now ready. 
Each of the volumes has a special editor, and 
comprises representative examples of some par- 
ticular literary genre, such as society verse, the 
short story, and literary criticism. This last 
topic reminds us to say that the third and final 
volume of Mr. Saintsbury's ' History of Criti- 
cism ' is about ready to appear. 



Novels in the usual numbers are scheduled 
for early publication. Among the most promis- 
ing titles are the following : ' The Last Hope,' 
by the late Henry Seton Merriman ; ' The Un- 
dercurrent,' by Mr. Robert Grant ; ' The Golden 
Bowl,' by Mr. Henry James ; ' A Ladder of 
Swords,' by Sir Gilbert Parker ; ' Guthrie of 
the Times,' by Mr. Joseph A. Altsheler ; ' The 
Seeker,' by Mr. Harry Leon Wilson ; ' Hearts 
in Exile,' by Mr. John Oxenham; 'The Be- 
trayal,' by Mr. E. Phillips Oppenheim ; ' The 
Loves of Miss Anne,' by Rev. S. R. Crockett; 
' The Farm of the Dagger,' by Mr. Eden Phil- 
potts; 'Beatrice of Venice,' by Mr. Max Pem- 
berton; 'Double Harness,' by Mr. Anthony 
Hope Hawkins; 'The Brethren,' by Mr. Rider 
Haggard; 'Whoever Shall Offend,' by Mr. F. 
Marion Crawford; 'The Common Lot,' by Mr. 
Robert Herrick ; ' Sabrina Warham,' by Mr. 
Laurence Housman ; ' Helianthus,' by ' Ouida ' ; 
'The Prodigal Son,' by Mr. Hall Caine; 'An 
Ark in Backwater,' by Mr. E. F. Benson ; ' My 
Lady of the North,' by Mr. Randall Parrish; 
' New Samaria,' by Dr. S. Weir Mitchell ; and 
'The Abbess of Vlaye,' by Mr. Stanley Wey- 
man. 

The poetical drama is to be illustrated by 
' Miriam ; or. The Sin of David,' byMr. Stephen 
Phillips, and ' William Shakespeare, Pedagogue 
and Poacher,' by Dr. Richard Garnett. There 
will also be a volume of new ' Poems and Plays,' 
by Mr. W. B. Yeats. Attractive books of new 
verse are to be offered by the Rev. Henry van 
Dyke, Mr. Frank Dempster Sherman, and Miss 
Edith M. Thomas. More important than any 
of these volumes is, of course, the volume of 
new poems by Mr. Swinburne. And in this con- 
nection, we may say a word of the new uniform 
edition of Mr. Swinburne's complete poems 
(exclusive of the dramas) to be published in six 
volumes. This long-promised collection has 
been one of the greatest of literary desiderata 
for many years, and we are inclined to believe, 
all things considered, that no other announce- 
ment for the coming season equals this in inter- 
est and importance. For the first time, the 
entire lyrical work of the greatest poet now 
living in the world is to be made really acces- 
sible to readers in general. 



PUBLISHE R AN D PUBLIC. 

Probably most people think of the publishing 
business as invested with a kind of dignity which 
sets it a little apart from other trades. Pub- 
lishers' offices are notoriously haunted by college 
boys anxious to be admitted to a calling of semi- 
literary character which yet promises a compe- 
tency. They dream happily of bearing a torch in 
one hand and a bag of the ready in the other.

aspect of it, which cannot be defined in business 
terms. Yet it is only an aspect. Popular tradi- 
tion to the contrary, it is not more natural for a 
publisher to be a disinterested patron of the lit- 
ei'ary art than for him to be a grindinsf commer- 
cial person. Undoubtedly most publishers desire 
to put forth some good literature; none who have 
to do with new books can even attempt to pub- 
lish nothing but good literature. 

Of course 'the publisher' does not mean what 
it onc« meant. The paternal publisher has taken 
his place with the Grub Street bookseller among 
relics of the past. A modern publishing house 
does its work by modern business methods. It 
has its head; but the detail goes to separate 
departments, manned by specially trained crews. 
Its left hand does not always know what its 
right hand is doing, — a fact which occa- 
sionally leads to complications between business 
motives and methods and others. Delicate adjust- 
ments are often necessary between editorial and 
business offices. But the general policy will be 
much like that which governs other commercial 
enterprises : to turn out as good an article as 
possible, and to dispose of it at as good a price 
as possible. As a rule, the publisher is doubt- 
less sincere in desiring to put forth what is, 
according to some reasonable standard, really 
worth publishing. The nicer problems of the 
trade turn upon the question as to how such a 
standard shall be determined and maintained. 

There are four classes of books ordinarily 
found on the lists of the modem publisher of 
the best type: (1) useful books, whether new 
or reprinted, which make no claim to the pos- 
session of literary quality; (2) reprints of work 
which time has determined to be the product 
of literary art; (3) new books which make some 
claim to literary quality, but for the publication 
of which there are strong practical reasons, such 
as timeliness, fitness for a special audience, and 
so on ; (4) new books which can hardly be 
expected to do more than 'pay expenses,' but 
which are published for their literary merit. The 
last-named class is necessarily small; the fact of 
its existence is a credit to the publisher. The 
first two classes suggest no serious problems. 
It is in connection with the third class that a 
more delicate question arises. At this point the 
publisher ceases to be the purveyor of a com- 
modity the value of which is determinable. Many 
books belong, as we have seen, to this class. Like 
shoes or soap, they are articles which the pub- 
lic specifically needs, and upon which it sets a 
specific value. With such books, when official 
analysis has proved them fit for their purpose, 
the publisher can afford to approach his public. 
If his services were to end there, they would be 
considerable, and calculable. The uncertainties 
of the trade inhere in its obligation, or its fatal- 
ity, of dealing with certain books which possess 
at least an hypothetical status as works of art. 
It appears to be a perfectly tenable position, 
though perhaps not a lofty one, that a work of 
art, having been put upon the market, becomes 
a purely commercial article, and must take its 
chances with other commercial articles. The 
dealer in works of art is, let us say^ Avithout spe- 



cial obligations to the public. He exhibits proper 
objects for sale, and charges such prices for them 
as are commonly set upon such objects. Mis- 
takes may occur, but it is his main purpose to 
offer only articles which are worth buying. The 
standard will be somewhat roughly estimated; 
refinements of discrimination in such matters 
must be left to the connoisseur and the critic. 
For the rest, the publishing-house has a right 
to put its best foot forward in advancing the sale 
of its own waxes; it cannot be expected to be 
colorlessly judicial in expressing its good opinion 
of them. The persons or committees by whose 
advice a given book has been accepted for publi- 
cation may express themselves in private with a 
good deal of resei'vation as to its absolute liter- 
ary merit. Public utterances of opinion rarely 
come direct from them. In a general way, they 
furnish material for the functionaries whose spe- 
cial business it is to advertise, directly or indi- 
rectly, the books of the house. Such reverbera- 
tions of editorial judgment can hardly retain much 
critical quality. The estimate of the given book 
which eventually goes forth as the opinion of the 
house may be, as a gentleman well acquainted 
with publishing said recently in private conversa- 
tion, 'an oj^liion of an opinion of an opinion.' 
The final version is naturally optimistic. If a 
book has been found good enough for the firm 
to publish, it is merely human for individuals 
in the employ of the firm to take for granted 
that it is a very good book indeed. They may 
know little or nothing of the grounds upon which 
it was accepted. 

These grounds may have been, in the main, 
other than literary, even when the book seems 
to fall within a literary category. For example : 
Suppose a novel written about a young Mormon 
whose career is made difficult, and interesting, 
by complications arising from his birth through 
polygamy. The publishers might accept it for 
some such reasons as these: (1) It is timely, 
because the question of polygamy has just come 
before the nation, perhaps for the last time; 
(2) there is nothing of this kind at present in 
the market; (3) the subject is treated so adriotly 
that the book ought to reach a large special audi- 
ence of liberal Mormons as well as the general 
audience of citizens who have just been excited 
against Mormonism; (4) it is written by So-and- 
so, whose other novels have had such-and-such a 
sale; (5) it is creditable in point of form, with 
at least as good a chance of surviving the year 
as the average novel. It seems, indeed, to have 
some pretensions to literary merit. 

As soon as the book is accepted, it becomes a 
part of this firm's stock in trade. It is advance- 
noticed and put through the press with a solicitude 
lively in proportion to the expectations of its 
sales. It grows to be an article of faith with the 
house, so that before it is fairly upon the market 
it may be figuring in advertisements as the liter- 
ary feat of the year, decade, or century. There 
is no moral issue here. Modern methods of adver- 
tising do not prescribe, or permit, delicacy or 
accuracy of expression. It is the publisher's 
affair, if he chooses to stultify himself over his 
signature. So far as his utterance of opinion is 



158 



THE DIAL. 



[Sept. 16, 



restricted to advertising space, it need not be 
challenged, either as to substance or as to form, 
except on grounds of taste. It is because the 
coarse method pays that, as Mr. Birrell says, 
publishers 'continue to extol the often secret 
chai-ms of their kept authors with an enthusiasm 
almost indelicate.' 

But the publisher's opinion fails to confine 
itself to advertising space; and it is at this 
point that his practice lays itself open to excep- 
tion on other grounds than those of taste. As a 
dealer in works of art, he has, we have liberally 
a,dmitted, no special obligations toward the pub- 
lic—unless, we may add, it be that he should be 
scrupulous to the utmost in fathering his positive 
recommendations. For the existence of the 
'reading-notice' or 'literary note' as now 
employed by the publisher, no adequate apology 
has as yet been offered. These notes are pre- 
pared in the publisher's offices by specially 
detailed persons. They are put up in convenient 
form for direct insertion in the newspaper 
columns. There is nothing in them to suggest 
to the uninitiated that they are not the work 
of the editorial staff. Indeed, not a little ingenu- 
ity is expended upon giving them a casual flavor; 
and it is evident that their value for advertising 
purposes depends upon the inconspicuousness, to 
put it mildly, of their origin. The specific object 
in view is to call attention to a particular book, 
by a particular author, issued by a particular pub- 
lishing-house. One or two of the parties in the 
enterprise commonly go unmentioned; this sug- 
gests an editorial indifference to the mere con- 
venience of the publisher which is effective in 
producing the desired illusion. 

Reading-notices are nominally of two kinds: 
those which give information, and those which 
express opinion. In truth, they shade impercepti- 
bly into each other. The information notice in 
its best form gives statements of fact which may 
reasonably be expected to add to one 's legitimate 
knowledge of an author or a book. One may find 
something dubious in the apparition of any para- 
graph of unpaid-for advertising made to look 
like a product of editorial industry or curiosity. 
But important news-items directly concern the 
public, and if the publisher is in a position to 
get such facts he is right to pass them on to the 
newspaper; he may even act as assistant editor 
as far as to word the items in question. They 
should possess some intrinsic importance. Too 
often they are statements of trivial fact framed 
for the sake of keeping the name of a man or a 
book before the public eye. 'The other day,' 
says Mr. Birrell, ' I read this announcement : 
"The memoir of Dr. Berry, of Wolverhampton, 
will bear the simple title, Life of the Rev. C. A. 
Berry, D.D." Heavens! what other title could 
it bear?' Such a note has comparative ingenu- 
ousness, at least. I have been assured by a per- 
son of experience that the more delicate successes 
in the art of reading-notice composition are due 
to skill in giving a statement of fact the effect 
of a criticism. 

Here we approach what is evidently a ques- 
tion of elementary ethics rather than of elemen- 
tai-y taste. Let us strain a point, and admit that I 



for the statement of facts publisher and editor 
have a practical right to exchange good offices,— 
the publisher getting valuable advertising for 
nothing, the editor getting his columns filled for 
nothing, and the reader getting whatever he can 
for a consideration. Is it possible to extend our 
complaisance to expressions of critical opinion, 
the source of which is left, to say the least, equiv- 
ocal? Publishers do not hesitate to admit that 
they set more value on the reading-notice than 
on regular advertising; the reasons for which 
fact are matters for consideration, but hardly for 
surmise. Probably there is no occasion for pro- 
test. We can only recognize the fact with regret 
that no trade, whatever its traditional associa- 
tions and ideals, can now get on comfortably 
without some little trick warranted to extract 
that last indispensable drop of profit from a 
public which is, on the whole, well content to 
pay tribute whenever a creditable degree of 
skill is shown in the levy. H. W. Boynton. 



COMMUNICA TION. 



HERBERT SPENCER ON DREAMS. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 
Among the many personal reminiscences lead- 
ing the author into speculative inquiry, which ren- 
der Herbert Spencer's ' Autobiography ' so attract- 
ive to thoughtful readers, occurs this sentence 
in connection with the writer's occasional use of 
opium to induce sleep: — 'In ordinary dreams, 
thoughts which seem valuable or witty, turn out 
on awaking to be nonsensical or inane; but in 
morphia dreams there sometimes arise thoughts 
which would not discredit the waking state.' He 
then relates (vol. 2, pp. 205-6) a dream of the lat- 
ter sort, which without being brilliantly witty is 
far more coherent than most unassisted dreams. 
Yet I think it may be capable of demonstration 
that the ' pipe dream ' is, as a rule, far more 
wildly extravagant and absurdly nonsensical than 
the natural dream. At any rate, I venture to 
believe I can match the synthetic philosopher's 
morphia dream with a recent one of my own, 
experienced under natural conditions; but of 
course I cannot make a perfectly impartial com- 
parison of the two. In my dream a college pro- 
fessor was examining in Roman history a stu- 
dent who persisted in mispronouncing proper 
names, as, — Rom-w-lus, Hann-i-bal, Calig-u-la (ac- 
cent always on the penult). At last the professor 
lost patience. ' Young man,' said he severely, ' unless 
you take care you will Ci-ce-ro [see zero] as the 
result of this examination.' I should add that the 
student's blunders did not remain so clear in my 
memory, on awaking, as the professor's punning 
admonition; but that the unhappy youth had 
sinned against the rules of quantity I was left in 
no doubt. Thus I had to reconstruct the first part 
of my dream a very little; otherwise I have 
related it as it occurred. Perhaps some of your 
readers can give similar or better instances of 
dreams wherein the god of sleep has not made 
such fools of his devotees as it must be confessed, 
to our humiliation, he too often does. p. p. b.

Zola, J^ovel,ist axd Eeformer.* 

The life of Zola by Mr. Vizetelly may natu- 
rally be regarded as the official English biogra- 
phy of the remarkable man, half Italian, half 
French, who won the attention of his epoch 
and finally forced criticism to take him as 
seriously as he took himself. It was the Vize- 
telly publishing house that brought out Zola 
in English translation; and the younger Vize- 
telly, the present biographer, was the novel- 
ist's trusted friend. He speaks with undoubted 
authority regarding the facts of Zola's career, 
and has obviously at his command far more 
material than he has cared to use. The book 
he has produced is in part satisfying, and in 
part not. In a clear and interesting way, the 
main facts of Zola's life are told; from the 
pages before him one can gain a perfectly 
definite idea of Zola the man. The book does 
not pretend to literary criticism, save in so far 
as criticism is often needed to explain details 
of the man'ci life; for Zola, of course, was essen- 
tially a writer, and his life-blood is in his 
books. There is, then, much explanation of 
general and special purposes of Zola's work, 
and the explanation is offered with candid 
enthusiasm. On the other hand, the book fails 
of being an adequate biography, partly because 
the writer is rather sparing of the minor per- 
sonal details we have come to regard as our 
right in biography, partly 'because he has a 
thesis to prove — the essential morality of Zola 
and the failure of the English public to appre- 
ciate that morality, — and partly because he 
has not himself the artist's power of present- 
ing his subject with due sense of proportion 
and of values. But over-emphasis reacts rather 
upon the writer than upon his subject: though 
one objects to the method, he must acknowl- 
edge that the writer has made his point. So 
if a certain didacticism leads Mr. Vizetelly to 
drive home with undue energy the fact that 
Zola was a most conscientious worker and a 
man of absolute devotion to his literary ideals, 
the reader after all is left with the correct 
notion in his mind; and this is no small matter. 
Mr. Vizetelly has no other charm of style than 
that of fluent sincerity, and he is handicapped 
by the fact that he holds a brief for his fatiier's 
publishing-house, which took up Zola at a time 
when to publish Zola meant, as it happened, 
fine and imprisonment. But with all his draw- 
backs, the biographer has produced a volume 
which tempts one to the paradox that if the

of his Life and Work. By Ernest Alfred Vizetelly.

book is not definitive, it nevertheless makes a 
definitive book unnecessary. 

We have before us, then, the life of a man 
who believed in the gospel of work, and who, 
having found out what he wanted to do, did 
the thing relentlessly. The Italian strain in 
Zola explains a great deal, — the man's insight, 
his large conceptions, his strong feelings, his 
tenacity. His career was one involving much 
hardship, the bitterness of neglect, the difficult 
search for the right medium of utterance, the 
antagonism of those who might have been his 
intellectual helpers, and, above all, the unyield- 
ing pursuit of the ideal. It was a career that 
closed in a moral triumph, a life that pre- 
eminently deserves study. 

To begin at the beginning, it is no wonder 
that Zola should have believed in heredity, 
since he saw it at work in his own nature. The 
father, Francesco (afterwards Francois) Zola, 
was a Venetian who came to France about 
1830. He was a military engineer, full of 
great projects for which he ceaselessly sought 
a hearing. If but few of his larger schemes 
came to maturity, it was doubtless because he 
was in advance of his time. Projects for the 
docks at Marseilles, for the fortification of 
Paris, were not accepted; but Mr. Vizetelly 
makes it fairly clear that the elder Zola's ideas 
have been wholly justified by time, while the 
plans that were used instead have proved inade- 
quate. A project that ultimately succeeded 
was the *Zola canal,' which supplies Aix with 
water. Intellectual capacity and untiring apti- 
tude for work were the father's chief bequest 
to his son (bom in 1840), for premature death 
left a family provided with but scant resources. 
The mother, — of the small tradesman cIeiss, 
one generation away from the sturdy peas- 
antry, — so:ight to give a fitting education to 
her son, fatherless at the age of seven; while 
at the same time she did her best to protect her 
interests in the yet unfulfilled canal scheme. 
Unjust treatment was accorded her, and a life 
of struggle followed her failure to establish her 
claims. 

Zola's earliest school-days were days of 
truancy; but from the bo/s twelfth year, the 
college period in Aix reads like a Sunday-school 
story. All the important constituents are 
there: the widow's son, industrious and excel- 
lent above his classmates, winning prize after 
prize in an imposing series, showing ability in 
all directions, and being * guided by one sim- 
ple, self-imposed rule, a rule which he carried 
into his after-life, and which largely proved 
the making of him. He did not eschew play 
and other recreations, he did not spend inter- 
minable hours in poring over books, there was 
nothing " goody-goody " about him ; but he

invariably learnt his lessons, prepared his 
exercises, before he went to play.' More sur- 
prising than this is the choice at seventeen of 
a scientific a)urse rather than a literary one, 
although the boy was now a maker of verse, 
and under the spell of Victor Hugo and of 
de Musset; and more surprising still is the fact 
that in Paris, whither his mother had removed 
in the vain hope of bettering the family for- 
tunes, the former prize-winner, now on a 
scholarship at the Lycee of St. Louis, remained 
among the mediocre, and finally failed to win 
his degree. He was now twenty, discredited, 
and penniless; and after trying his hand at a 
clerkship in the customs at two francs a day, 
he went back to his literary attempts, mostly 
verse, and began a Grub-street existence. His 
mother had no longer enough income for two 
to live upon, and Zola lived alone, often in the 
winter, 

'Fireless, shivering in bed, with every garment he 
possesses piled over his legs, and his fingers red 
with the cold while he writes his verses with the 
stump of a jtcncil. . . . His great desire when 
he awakes of a morning is to procure that day, by 
hook or crook, the princely sum of three sous in 
order that he may buy a candle for his next 
evening's work. At times he is in despair: he is 
forced to commit his lines to memory during the 
long winter night, for lack of the candle which 
would have enabled him to confide them to paper. 
. . . It was then, as he afterward told Guy de 
Maupassant, that he lived for days together on a 
little bread, which, in Provencal fashion, he dipped 
in oil; that he set himself to catch sparrows from 
his window, roasting them on a curtain rod; that 
he " played the Arab," remaining indoors for a 
week at a time, draped in a coverlet, because he 
had no garments to wear. . . . He often used 
to say in after-life that the only coat he possessed 
in that year of misery ended by fading from black 
to a rusty green. Thus, when he went hither and 
thither soliciting employment, he was very badly 
received. " I gathered that people thought me too 
shabby. I was told, too, that my handwriting was 
very bad; briefly, I was good for nothing. . . . 
Good for nothing — that was the answer to my en- 
deavours; good for nothing — unless it were to 
suffer, to sob, to weep over my youth and my 
heart. ... I had grown up dreaming of glory 
and fortune, I awoke to find myself stranded in 
the mire." ' 

A turn of fortune in 186r3 gave Zola a small 
clerkship, at a hundred francs monthly, in the 
publishing-house of Hachette ; and he felt that 
he was saved. He now managed to get some of 
his writing into the newspapers; and in 1864 
a volume of short stories met with acceptance, 
not by Hachette, but by another house. The 
first real turn of affairs had now come; here 
are Zola's words: 

' The battle has been short, and I am astonished 
that I have i.ot suffered more. I am now on the 
threshold: the plain is vast, and I may break my 
neck crossing it; but no matter, — as it only remains 
for me to march onward, I will march.' 

To finish his first novel, ' La Confession de 



Claude,' was the next thing to do; and inciden- 
tally he kept up a steady fire of newspaper 
criticism, earning perhaps two hundred francs 
a month by his pen. In 1865 ' Claude ' ap- 
peared, and Zola left Hachette's to devote 
himself entirely to writing. From now, until 
the days of the Dreyfus case, the story is mainly 
one of intellectual development and slowly 
improving worldly condition. It was not by any 
means all plain sailing : there were plays that 
were not accepted, ventures in art criticism 
arousing great partisan feeling, occasional 
serious diminutions in income; the earlier 
stories, though published, had not won their 
way; ' Therese Kaquin' (1867) was the first 
real success. 

Two years later, Zola entered into a con- 
tract to begin a series of novels dealing with the 
history of a whole family. In large measure, 
this ' Rougon-Macquart ' series was liis life- 
work; and it is highly characteristic of Zola 
that he completely finished the project, even 
though its final form included nearly twice as 
much as the original outline indicated. But 
the publisher's failure meant financial distress 
to the author, and postponement of the great 
scheme. Friends were made, and also ene- 
mies, — for Zola was outspoken in his literary 
criticism; and gradually the man made himself 
a place in the literary life of Paris. To the 
publisher Charpentier, Theophile Gautier, in 
speaking one evening of the young writers of 
the day, said : ' There is one among them who 
is very unlucky, and who is different from 
most of the others. You should admit him 
among your authors, my dear Charpentier. If 
I am not vastly mistaken, he possesses a touch 
of genius. His name is Emile Zola. Have you 
ever heard of him?' This little word of com- 
mendation turned out to be Zola's opportunity. 
Charpentier became his publisher, and the 
worldly battle was won at last. Zola was 
gradually coming to an understanding of the 
scope of sucli a series as that of the ' Rougon- 
Macquarts,' but in a special sense he perhaps 
hardly came into his own field until be wrote 
''L'Assommoir.' This forced the issue. Tlie 
vogue of the book, enormous for those days 
when a groat sale meant actually interested 
readers, made it impossible to ignore the fact 
that the man had ' arrived.' Far from avoid- 
ing controversy, Zola invited it, — it made the 
vogue of his books greater, and his doctrine 
emerged into public attention. From this 
time forward, he had the centre of the stage. 
He finished at last his 'Rougon' series, and 
then projected new groups of novels, a didactic 
purpose becoming more and more evident as 
the years went on, until finally some of his 
work is but the form of fiction in the service

of a thesis. To discuss Zola's life during this 
period of his greatest success is to discuss his 
literary output, work by work; and this is out 
of the question here. 

One comes now to Zola's share in the Drey- 
fus case. Mr, Vizetelly's account of this is full 
and adequate, presenting the facts fairly, it 
would seem, and arranging the material clearly. 
Zola's participation in the case was wholly 
impersonal: that is, he had no acquaintance 
with the Dreyfus family, but arrived at his con- 
clusions from a sober study of the testimony 
that was accessible to him. Before he wrote 
the famous open letter to the President of the 
Eepublic, he had published in ' Figaro ' a series 
of articles, temperately asking for a full 
inquiry. The clamor that ensued frightened 
the newspaper into stopping the articles. Zola 
then found a means of expression in pam- 
phlets; and on becoming convinced finally that 
only some violent method could secure revision, 
he hit upon the plan of addressing a letter to 
President Faure, couching it in such words 
that for the honor of the nation the writer 
would have to be brought to trial and suffer the 
penalty of libel unless he could prove his 
charges. The matter is too recent to need 
recapitulation here; one may more fittingly 
compliment Mr. Vizetelly on his careful pres- 
entation of a rather intricate subject. That his 
explanation of Zola's attitude is correct admits 
of no doubt. The man was sincere and self- 
sacrificing, and events have shown that he was 
right. 

i^ot the least interesting chapter in the vol- 
ume is the one that tells in detail the story of 
the English publication of Zola. Mr. Vizetelly 
is speaking literally pro domo sua, and wins 
our sympathy, even if not our complete appro- 
bation. Here, however, and in the pages tell- 
ing of a critical moral episode of Zola's life, 
Mr. Vizetelly protests too much, and not 
always with good taste; it would have been bet- 
ter to state the facts quietly and dispense with 
argument. 

In the light of the full knowledge of Zola's 
life that thlt book gives, one gathers up anew 
his impressions of the man and the writer. 
One does not nowadays repeat Tennyson's 
word, ' the trough of Zolaism,' as a fair criti- 
cism ; the man and his work are too significant 
to be dismissed with a contemptuous label. 
And yet, granting to the uttermost the moral 
purpose the author had in dealing with the 
horrors and uglinesses of life, — granting, as 
one easily may, that Zola w^rote nothing for 
the sake of lubricity, and granting the right 
of literature to treat whatever is human, — 
the serious reader of Zola is likely to ask him- 
self. What is the good of most of this ? The | 



portrayal of vice rarely proves a deterrent: 
many of Zola's books undoubtedly sold simply 
because they seemed indecent; and one may 
doubt their disclipinary effect upon the pur- 
chasers. Those readers, on the other hand, who 
could apprehend the moral purpose under the 
repulsiveness, were in the main in no need of 
the lesson as such. So the question comes back, 
as always, to this: Has the work been done 
with the artistic control that creates the thing 
we call beauty ? Much, perhaps most, of Zola's 
work will not stand such a test. One wonders, 
after all, how much, from a literary point of 
view, Zola's irdefatigableness was futile: there 
are many dull and many hateful pages to 
answer for in the novels; nor is it over-likely 
that the novels will last. But it was due to 
his self-discipline in holding to the purpose of 
his novels, that Zola rose to his opportunity 
and rendered France the greatest of services, 
accusing French militarism of its crime. It; 
may well be that this man of letters will occupy 
a higher place in the history of France than in 
her literature. Martin W. Sampson.

tion was not one of those neutral events which 
a writer can describe without revealing him- 
self. It was such a confused melee of prophetic 
iSeals, deep-rooted habits, and ordinary pas- 
sions, that its history has grown as men have 
grown, or as changes have come in literary 
forms or social theories. There has been a 
development in the conception of it capable of 
being treated historically, and which the * gen- 
eral public' should understand, if this rather 
vague personage is to approach the subject 
intelligently. 

When history is written on the cooperative 
plan, it must be difficult to distribute the 
material in such a way as to secure a sufficiently 
full consideration of special topics without 
drawing from the main stream too much of its

force. In this volume the distribution has been 
made with good judgment, but one occasionally 
receives the impression that the writers have 
followed the programme too rigorously. Many 
things given their special setting in Professor 
Viollet's invaluable chapter on ' French Law in 
the Age of the Revolution ' should be touched 
in the chapters on the Constituent, the Legis- 
lative Assembly, and. the Convention; other- 
wise the importance of their work will be mis- 
conceived. Much the same may be said of 
financial affairs, described in a separate chapter 
by Mr. Henry Higgs. The ' General War, ' the 
' Naval War, ' and foreign affairs prior to the 
1795 treaties, are also, and necessarily, man- 
aged in special chapters, for each of these 
topics possesses a peculiar center of interest and 
its own line of development. At the same time 
the meddlesome policy of other states and their 
threats of war profoundly affected the course 
of the Revolution, and should be explained 
adequately in the general narrative even at the 
cost of some repetition. Mr. Moreton Mac- 
donald, who writes on the Legislative and the 
Convention, should have conceded more to the 
menace on the frontier in his analysis of the 
origin of Revolutionary violence. 

It is of more doubtful wisdom to divide, as 
is done here, the general narrative, — that is, 
in the main, the political history of the Revolu- 
tion, — among four writers ; for there is 
danger of a shifting of attitude which may 
confuse the reader. Of course such a division 
is explicable if it is suggested by the special 
researches of the writers themselves. MM. 
Lavisse and Rambaud, in the eighth volume of 
their ' Histoire Generale, ' avoided the danger 
by assigning the whole to Professor Aulard, 
already distinguished for an unrivalled knowl- 
edge of the political history of the Revolution. 
In the present case, Mr. Macdonald's work on 
the later Assemblies is noticeably different in 
tone from Professor Montague's description of 
the Constituent; and the difference is not alto- 
gether accounted for by the fact that the sub- 
ject becomes more repellent as the history of 
the Legislative and of the Convention proceeds. 
There is no such difference of tone or attitude 
between Mr. Fortescue's chapter on the Direc- 
tory and Mr. Fisher's 'Brumaire.' 

Among the noteworthy chapters of the volume 
are Professor Richard Lodge's ' European 
Powers and the Eastern Question' and the 
' Extinction of Poland. ' In the first he con- 
siders incidentally the earlier phases of Pitt's 
foreign policy described by Mr. Oscar Browning 
in a special chapter. Ilis estimate of Pitt's 
influence is less emphatically eulogistic than 
Mr. Browning's; indeed, he seems to feel that 
the Emperor Leopold was the master diplo- 
matist of 1790 and 1791. Equally noteworthy 



are Dr. J. H. Rose's three chapters on the 
foreign war after General Bonaparte becomes 
the principal figure. Although this is largely 
the same ground which he covered in his recent 
biography of Napoleon I., the new account is 
in no sense a repetition of the other. But for 
an occasional turn of phrase or identity of con- 
ception, it would be difficult to recognize the 
relationship of the two. 

No part of the work succeeds better in giving 
just the facts necessary for an exact understand- 
ing of the matters in hand than Professor 
Montague's chapters on the Old Regime and the 
period of the Constituent. They show every- 
Avhere a careful consideration of the results of 
recent researches, — those, for example, upon 
the much-debated question of the amount of 
land held by the peasants. The facts are not 
poured out in confusing masses, but their 
nature is luminously characterized in a para- 
graph or two, each word of which is almost a 
summary. Although the amount of attention 
granted to the Old Regime is questionable, 
when it is remembered that another volume of 
the series is to treat the Eighteenth Century, 
these two chapters could ill be spared. In some 
respects they are superior to those on the Con- 
stituent. It is instructive to see in detail into 
what an impasse the government had blundered 
by 1788. Strong statesmanship was needed in 
order that the King might recover that leader- 
ship in the nation's affairs which so many of 
his ancestors had held. A ^business man's 
administration,' such as Necker could give, was 
not the remedy. 

Many of Professor Montague's characteriza- 
tions of men or of assemblies are remarkably 
suggestive. After a few words on Mounier, 
Malouet, and Sieyes, he introduces Mirabeau in 
this fashion: 'But these men were presently 
overshadowed by one who had no recommenda- 
tions save genius and courage, whose reputa- 
tion was not far removed from infamy, and 
who, though it was impossible to detpise or dif- 
ficult to hate him, was deeply dis,*,rusted by 
almost all his colleagues.' Perhaps the ma- 
chinery of such a sentence glittei-s too much, but 
it would be hard to construct anything better 
embodying the situation of Mirabeau at the 
opening of the States General. It is followed 
by a sketch, two or three pages long, which 
brings the man and his aims before the reader, 
and in which there is not a stroke or a touch 
that seems superfluous. Equally satisfactory 
is this lucid summary of the function of the 
States General, which Professor Montague has 
just been comparing with the English parlia- 
ment : ' What had been true at first of all 
mediaeval parliaments remained true of the 
States General to the end. The deputies 
remained agents in relation to their electors.

petitioners in relation to the King, ' etc. Of 
the National Assembly he- acutely remarks, * It 
contained many excellent members of commit- 
tee, but very few statesmen, and to these it 
rarely listened. No wonder, therefore, that it 
should have made many good laws but have 
failed entirely to govern.' 

In these chapters there are few defects to 
be noted. One would hardly suspect, however, 
from Professor Montague's description of the 
decrees of August 4, that they constituted rather 
a programme of reform than a comprehensive 
piece of legislation. It is only in Professor 
VioUet's chapter that the matter is adequately 
explained. Furthermore, Professor Montague 
does not make clear the relation between the 
controversy over a second chamber and that 
upon the royal vote. He gives the impression 
also that the ' suspensive ' veto was a weak form 
of veto, whereas it might hold back a project 
of law from three to six years. Largely moved 
by the necessity of compressing his descriptions 
of events, he has not furnished a clear account 
of the origin of October 5—6. He has also 
fallen into the error, corrected by Viollet on a 
later page, of saying that the Constituent abol- 
ished slavery in the colonies. This was done 
by the Convention. 

The middle period of the Revolution is not 
described by Mr. Macdonald in so satisfying a 
manner. The real difficulty is that he has no 
sympathy with the France of those fatal years. 
Before the conclusion of his final chapter on 
the Constituent, the note of disappointment in 
Professor Montague's writing had ominously 
increased, but his sympathy did not fail. One 
turns the page and feels an atmosphere of 
hostile criticism, full of condemnation, some- 
times of contempt. Professor Montague, in 
more than a page of detail given to the machin- 
ery for the election of deputies, does not hint 
at anything sinister about this machinery; but 
Mr. Macdonald discovers that its complication 
was 'wanton and deliberate,' — 'all a part of 
the Jacobin plan.' He continues : ' This over- 
elal)oration of the electoral arrangements kept 
all busy men, — in other words, all respectable 
men, — from the ballot, and handed it over to 
idlers and vagabonds.' It is the tone of this 
statem^ent, rather than its inconsistency with 
the fact that only tax-payers or ' active citi- 
zens ' could vote, which is objectionable. The 
whole passage is a developed charge that the 
Jacobins used every device known in eighteenth- 
century English electioneering practice, and 
others less brutal. 

The same unsympathetic attitude controls 
the brief characterizations of members of the 
Legislative Assembly and of the Convention. 
Brissot, for example, is the ' son of a pastry 
cook/ who, as a journalist and during his exile 



in England, had picked up a ' specious and sub- 
terranean knowledge of European politics,' 
enabling him 'to pose as a great authority on 
foreign affairs.' He further stigmatizes him as 
' thoroughly insincere and self-seeking.' To 
malign Brissot is a literary diversion as old as 
the Eevolution itself. It was good Jacobins 
like Camille Desmoulins who organized the tra- 
dition. From such judgments it is refreshing 
to turn to a letter written, after the execution 
of the Girondins, to Sir Samuel Eomilly, by 
Etienne Pumont, one of Mirabeau's friends, 
who says he never liked Brissot as a politician, 
but that this did not prevent him ' from doing 
justice to his virtues, to his private character, 
to his disinterestedness, to his social qualities as 
a husband, a father, a friend, and as an in- 
trepid advocate of the wretched negroes.' 

Such a lack of sympathy leads Mr. Mac- 
donald to the verge of misstatement. The 
' destruction ' of Lyons is an illustration. He 
intimates that 'a considerable portion of the 
city was destroyed.' But it was only ridiculous 
monsters like Collot d'Herbois who could poetize 
about a day when the passing traveller would 
discover on the site of Lyons only a few cot- 
tages, ' which the friends of equality shall dwell 
in, living happily on the benefits of nature.' The 
' considerable portion ' destroyed consisted of a 
few houses in the wealthy quarter of Bellecoeur. 
The Convention in its decree expressly ex- 
empted public buildings, buildings devoted to 
industry, and the dwellings of the poor. Mr. 
Macdonald's explanations of the Maximum and 
of the function of ' representatives on mission ' 
are scarcely more lucid or accurate. This is 
particularly unfortunate in case of the Max- 
imum, which was a curious wholesale applica- 
tion of an economic practice familiar under 
the Old Regime. 

The effect of the Revolution upon England 
and Europe, even upon the Balkan peoples, is 
succinctly described in a final chapter by Mr. 
G. P. Gooch. Unfortunately, nothing is said 
about the impression made in America. It is 
not a sufficient answer to say that this was pre- 
cluded by the title of the chapter. The steady 
sympathy which the republican Americans, 
themselves lately revolutionists, felt for Revo- 
lutionary France, even after the execution of 
the King, is significant. They made a distinc- 
tion between the essential Revolution and the 
deeds of the Robespierrist faction, — a distinc- 
tion which some English and Continental 
critics, with latent aristocratic or monarchist 
prejudices, do not always succeed in keeping 
clear. 

The twenty-five chapters of this volume, 
taken as a whole, impress one as a remarkably 
useful setting forth of the facts essential to an 
understanding of the Revolution. If they are

not equally successful in interpreting it in a 
large and sympathetic spirit as the tragic con- 
summation of the long development of French 
institutions, this is probably due to the treat- 
ment of the middle period as a vulgar melo- 
drama. Henry E. Bourne.

The centennial of the Lewis and Clark Ex- 
ploration of the Northwest is responsible for 
the increase of literature upon that subject 
which the year has produced, and is still to 
produce according to announcements of publish- 
ers. No other adventure into the wilderness 
changed so much of the United States domain 
from the unknown to the known, or made as 
much geography in the same time. The revival 
of interest in Lewis and Clark has served to 
call fresh attention to the accomplishments of 
other courageous spirits sent forth to spy out 
the land before the advance of civilization. 

Few readers are possessed of a mind so pro- 
saic or a circulation so sluggish as not to be 
moved by a good story of adventure. Hero- 
worship is almost second-nature when called 
forth by indomitable courage, physical hard- 
ship, or triumphant achievement. In the guise 
of fiction, adventure has played and will con- 
tinue to play a large part as a motive in litera- 
ture. When transformed into history by a 
lively imagination and a facile pen, it claims 
scarcely less attention. Yet many prefer to 
learn of adventures in neither of these guises, 
but to go direct to the original sources when 
they are available, and to read in the 'first 
person singular' the moving accidents by field 
and flood which befell the makers of continental 
trails. 

To satisfy this class of readers, Messrs. A. S. 
Barnes & Company have prepared a series of 
reprints of personal descriptions of explorations 
under the title ' The Trail Makers.' The ten 
volumes constituting the series have been put 
into handy duodecimo shape, without reducing 
the type to an objectionable size. Eeprints of 
the original maps also are given, with introduc- 
tions and other useful addenda. Uniformity 
in style and care in details have produced a 
very attractive series.

reading public at large. The expedition was 
made twelve years before the English explora- 
tions began on the Atlantic coast, and seventy 
years previous to any permanent settlement by 
that nation. It does not come into touch with 
the history of the United States, until the open- 
ing of the Santa Fe Trail and our territorial 
expansion disclosed its fruits in the province 
of New Mexico. This comparatively remote 
historical field will be made accessible to many 
readers by the volume entitled 'Coronado's 
Journey,' The official and private descriptions 
made by several of the participants have been 
taken from the Spanish archives and translated 
into English by Dr. George Parker Winship, 
who has added an excellent itinerary of the 
various Spanish expeditions in America. The 
foot-notes made by Mr. Winship are so useful 
that one wishes a similar attention had been 
paid the remaining volumes. Admitting that 
annotations are distracting and that ' editors ' 
commonly over-annotate, the fact remains that 
in reprints treating of remote places and per- 
sons notes are valuable for the sake of identi- 
fication. They would have materially increased 
the value of another volume in the series — a 
reprint of the voyages and travels of Daniel 
Williams Harmon, for twelve years connected 
with the fur companies of the Northwest. As a 
partner in the Northwest Fur Company and in 
charge of the company interests beyond the 
Rocky Mountains, he made these observations 
while leading the life of a white man among 
savages. The original was probably printed in 
1820. This uncertainty of the date of original 
publication would have been cleared by the 
introduction of facsimiles of title-pages, as is 
done in some reprints. 

The Lewis and Clark reprint occupies three 
volumes. A few pages containing an introduc- 
tory sketch of the purchase of Louisiana, by 
Professor McMaster, are placed in the first 
volume. Otherwise, the introductions in the 
series are of minor merit. The Biddle edition 
of the Lewis and Clark papers is followed. 

Two volumes are given to Alexander Mac- 
kenzie's Voyages to the Arctic and the Pacific 
oceans in 1789 and 1793. As the first Euro- 
pean known to written history to cross the 
continent in its northern portion, Mackenzie's 
name will always be of interest. Having charge 
of the Northwest Fur Company's post at De- 
troit, and ordered to make explorations in the 
back country, he undertook the journeys, and 
wrote descriptions, which were first printed in 
London in 1801, He settled negatively the 
question, long in dispute, of the possible exists 
ence of a northwestern water-passage to the 
Pacific. W^hile allording no such scientific 
information as characterized the accounts of 
Lewis and Clark, the observations of Mackenzie

THE BIALr

upon the natural history of the vast regions he 
traversed are of no small value. 

Much more recent than these journeys, and 
made for quite a different object, was that of 
Sir George William Francis Butler, an officer 
of the British army stationed in Canada. Pure- 
ly for the love of adventure, he traversed the 
va,st solitudes lying between the northern for- 
ests and the barren lands. He passed along the 
Eed Eiver of the North to Lake Athabasca and 
along the Peace River to the Rocky Mountains, 
thence turning to the Frazer River. His ac- 
count of the trip was first published in 1872. 

There was need of a popular reprint of Cad- 
wallader Colden's ' History of the Five N^a- 
tions,' but why it was placed in a series on trail- 
makers is not easy to ascertain. Its publication 
in 1747 no doubt accomplished the object the 
writer had in calling British attention to the 
menace of the French on the northern border 
of their American colonies, and to the service 
the Five Nations would render if properly 
allied to the English and used as a barrier 
against the French. The history also served 
at the time to call forth an early, if not the 
first, attention of Europe to American letters. 
The author was a scholar and scientist, and his 
history is too valuable an authority on early 
North America to disappear by being allowed 
to drop from print. Edwin E. Sparks.

OF Action.* 

Those who have used John Bellows's excellent 
French pocket-dictionary, — and its users are 
legion, — will be pleased to learn that its com- 
piler was much more than a lexicographer, that 
he was in fact the verj' last sort of man one 
would take to be a maker of dictionaries. That 
his tiny roan-bound, prayerbook-like ' Diction- 
ary for the Pocket ' was among the most highly 
prized volumes in Oliver Wendell Holmes's 
library, is probably known to many ; but that he 
himself was one of the Autocrat's valued friends 
and correspondents is not so well known. With 
Senator Hoar also he was on the friendliest 
terms. It may be remembered that at the Har- 
vard commencement of three years ago Mr. Bel- 
lows walked with the Senator (who was Presi- 
dent of the Alumni Association) at the head of 
the procession, on his way to Sanders Theatre to 
receive his honorary M.A. degree. At that 
time he and Mrs. Bellows were paying a three- 
months' visit to America. Other friends in this 
country, especially among the Quakers (for he 
was one of them), he had in good number.

Bom at Liskeard, Cornwall, in 1831, John 
Bellows early learned the printer's trade, and 
rose, when little over thirty, to be master of 
the foremost printing-house in Gloucester. But 
his business was allowed to absorb by no means 
all his energies. Humanitarian movements of 
many kinds appealed to him, and he was sent 
on numerous missions of mercy by the Society 
of Friends, in whose councils his weight and 
influence came more and more to be recognized 
and valued. Among his good works of this 
kind may be mentioned journeys to France in 
aid of the sufferers from the war of 1870, to 
Russia and the Caucasus in behalf of the Stun- 
dists and other persecuted sects, to Turkey for 
the purpose of helping the Armenians, and to 
St. Petersburg in the interest of the Doukho- 
bors, whose emigration to Canada was in no 
small measure the result of his activity and 
generosity, other English Quakers acting with 
him. That he sought out Count Tolstoi in the 
course of these Russian missions, and that the 
two became warmly attached, goes without say- 
ing. Incidentally, it was work of this sort in 
foreign lands that made John Bellows feel the 
need of serviceable pocket dictionaries of the 
languages he had occasion to use. A visit to 
Norway had first suggested to him the compila- 
tion of a Norwegian dictionary; but he soon 
became convinced that a French one would be 
more generally useful. Hence the publication, 
after seven years of intermittent labor upon it, 
of the now familiar work that bears his name. 
As an antiquary versed in the Roman antiquities 
of Britain, and especially of Gloucester, John 
Bellows's fame was not confined to his own 
country. Foreign antiquarian societies elected 
him to membership and solicited his literary 
contributions. As a Liberal Unionist in 
polities, he exerted an influence that was hand- 
somely acknowledged by Ijord Salisbury. He 
was held in high esteem by his business asso- 
ciates, his friends both at home and abroad 
were many, his family life appears to have been 
all that heart could desire, and when death 
came, at seventy-one, nine children and a 
devoted wife surrounded his death-bed. This 
outline of his life is bald and meagre enough; 
but let us turn to some of his written and 
spoken utterances, and we shall perhaps catch a 
suggestion of the man's peculiar charm. Moral 
earnestness, fearless candor, a hatred of cant, 
a lively fancy, and a loving heart are what we 
shall not fail to discover in his always entertain- 
ing letters to wife, children, and friends. First, 
a passage from his wife's narrative will show 
the struggle he had to make before he could 
bring himself to a strict observance of Quaker 
customs. 

' He never shrank from a course that he felt it 
right to take, because of the pain involved in it.

He never chose the easier way. The change of 
dress was not bo much of a trial to him as the 
change in speech; but, having made up his mind as 
to his right course, he never faltered, though at 
times the anguish of mind that he passed through 
was almost more than he could endure. He thought 
it necessary to explain to the work-girls under him 
the great change that had taken place in his out- 
look on life, and, that for the future he would have 
to address them in Quaker language, though he had 
a morbid dread of the manner in which this might 
be received. Those who knew him later can imagine 
the scene where he melted these rough girls to tears 
by his narrative. One of them, when he had fin- 
ished, became spokeswoman for the rest, assuring 
him, with tears, that they hoped he would never 
shrink from doing and saying what he felt, in his 
conscience, to be right.' 

Here are some suggestive passages from a 
letter to Oliver Wendell Holmes acknowledg- 
ing the receipt of ' Over the Teacups ' : 

' One mystery thy volume has set me further 
away than ever from solving: and that is, "Where 
is the boundary between childhood and boyhood; or 
boyhood and manhood and [old] age? This I have 
never been able to find. . . . Only this very 
evening I was wheedled into an interlude from the 
" Teacups," by a deputation of four Gallios who 
care for none of these things, to entreat that I 
would " give them a chase." Seven-year-old put 
the request m a very low voice; for a " chase " 
in this house is forbidden by the mistress on 
the ground that it makes dust: it destroys the 
carpets: it leaves finger-marks on the walls: it 
tears the clothes: it upsets the furniture: with 
other high crimes and misdemeanors which are duly 
set forth in the manifesto that forbids chasing ' ' in- 
doors. " . . . So, being obliged to go, I went; 
and once in the game, even five-year-old herself 
could not throw her heart and soul into it more 
entirely! Boy! Why, I never was more of a boy 
in my life! What boy in the whole world ever 
cared about carpets in the midst of a chase? And 
did I care one straw whether they were old sacks, 
or Cloth of Gold, or the High Priest of Mecca's 
prayer rugs, if by racing over them I could catch 
two of those hares at one hit ? Why, here is a game 
older than Adam! The old hunting instinct of the 
cave-men, as a modern author has shown, came 
down to us by heredity; an instinct that has scores 
of times transformed me into a bear, under the di- 
ning-room table, and which only the counterbalancing 
force of civilized life kept from transforming me 
into an elephimt after our chase was over just now 
— crawling into the room with three men on my 
back, and one leading me! I do not think that any- 
thing in this life has more puzzled me than this con- 
sciousness that the bound between boyhood and 
manhood 

"Is marked by no distinguishable line ; 

The turf unites, the pathways intertwine." 

The secret is this (?) that we go on adding to our 
existing ring of life, as the ammonites do with their 
spiral shells. We include all that has gone before; 
hence we can keep more fully in touch or in sym- 
pathy with children, than they can with us.' 

The descriptions which his letters from south- 
eastern Russia give of Caucasian scenery and 
people, and of the hardships and perils of travel 
in that wild region, are extremely interesting, 
but must not be spoiled by mutilation. From 
an account of a visit to Count Tolstoi and his 



family in Moscow, in 1893, illustrative passages 
may be taken. 

' He was exceedingly glad to see me, and I felt 
bound up in him more than I can express. There 
are some things in which we see eye to eye; and 
others that t know to a certainty he is mistaken 
in, and which I would give much to open his eyes 
to. To-day, besides the conversation at his own. 
house, he accompanied me for many miles over 
Moscow on foot and in the trams. . . . Little 
Ivan is five: his sister Alexandra, a most lovely 
child of eight. . . . The two little ones dragged 
nie off, at this point, to the nursery, to shew li.. 
their toys and their brother's puppy. " An Eng- 
lish pointer, Mr. Bellows." " What is his name? " 
" O, he has not got a name yet. You see it is — 
a little girl — and my brother would rather have 
a little boy: so it will be changed." Ivan's Eng- 
lish is hardly so perfect as his sister's. It was 
delightful to see his earnestness as he strove aiter 
words to say what he wanted.' 

In 1890, a newspaper account of the suffer- 
ings undergone by American cattle on their 
way to Europe so pained Mr. Bellows that he 
resolved to eat no more meat. Two years later 
he felt it his duty to abstain also from fish. In 
connection with this sensitiveness of conscience 
the following passages are of interest. The 
first is from a letter written to his wife from 
southeastern Eussia; the second is from Mrs. 
Bellows's narrative. 

' As to my interest in science during the journey, 
I get along excellently with my companions; for 
although they have not the same tastes, I am often 
able to interest them with some details. They are 
exceedingly nice and very unselfish: always trying 
to give me the most comfortable place, etc. As to 
food, we have got on all the better in the last few 
days for the fast of the Greek Church; for this 
leads to the Hotels and Eestaurants having a sort 
of double menu: vegetarian for the " orthodox." 
I conclude to discontinue fish: for I could not kill 
them myself; and if I cannot kill, I will not let 
others kill for me. That the most robust health and 
strength can be maintained without eating flesh is 
shown by the porters of Tiflis, who are practically 
vegetarians. ' 

' During his visit to St. Petersburg in 1892 he 
was dining one evening with a gentleman, who 
enquired of him if he had been at a certain ball 
on the previous evening, and if he had seen such 
and such a play. To these enquiries John Bellows 
had to reply in the negative; and, further, that he 
had never been to a ball or to a theatre in his life. 
This statement was so astounding to his host that 
he laid down his knife and fork, looked fixedly at 
him, and exclaimed: " You never go to balls, you 
don't go to the theatre, you drink no wine, and you 
eat no meat; then do tell me if your life is worth 
living at all! " But it was not on such things. as 
these that John Bellows depended for his happiness; 
and yet it would have been hard to find, anyone who 
got more ketu enjoyment out of life than he did: 
certainly no one was more interested in every phase 
of it, from the spiritual welfare of a nation to the 
passing amusement of a child. ' 

In his visit to this country, the Quaker from 
Gloucester was especially interested in Phila- 
delphia and the people he met there. As a 
philologian he noted local pronunciation and

idioms. He recognized Cornish words and inton- 
ations in the speech of some Pennsylvanians. 
'They say, for instance, a house is torn down 
(which is not English ! ) They have told me, 
when I have once or twice spoken in their 
meetings, they have been struck with my tone 
being much nearer their own than that of Eng- 
lish Friends generally is !' The book reveals 
many of John Bellows's lovable traits. So used 
was he to picking up solitary foot-passengers 
when he was driving alone, that his horse often 
embarrassed him by stopping whenever a pedes- 
trian was overtaken. On one occasion Mr. 
Bellows persisted in bringing a pleasant visit 
to a close on a fixed day, although urged to 
stay and desiring to stay to attend a picnic, 
because he had promised a poor boy in London 
that he should carry his bag if he would meet 
a certain train; and there was no means of 
arranging a postponement with the boy. The 
lesson to be learned from John Bellows's life 
may best be indicated in his own words refer- 
ring to diversities of belief but the same spirit. 

' In going through life, no two of us have pre- 
cisely the same path to tread. Yet we cannot con- 
template the step by which another soul has over- 
come the world, without being helped in our own, 
though different, path to the same end. If we are 
in a right state of mind, we shall be in sympathy 
with such a man, notwithstanding that the truths 
which were the principal ones he was called to con- 
tend for, may not, at present, even be shown to us 
at all. Unity of spirit does not lie in holding the 
same views of things, or learning the same outward 
lessons; but m loving and cherishing the truth in 
whatever direction it is made manifest to us.' 

Tolerance toward all was repeatedly preached 
by this most tolerant of men. A better ac- 
quaintance between nations, be held, would lead 
to that international tolerance which would 
make war impossible. ' Even individually/ he 
adds, ' if we experience dislike toward a person, 
such a feeling lessens as we come to know him 
more closely, and enter into his trials and sor- 
rows : for it is impossible to hate even a wicked 
man if we know all about him.' He might well 
have summed this up in his favorite French: 
' Tout comprendre c'est tout pardonner.' 

The book does credit to its printers, — Messrs. 
Max and William Bellows, sons of John, — as 
well as to its compiler. Some of its misused 
terms, however, as applied by an Englishman 
to things in America, are amusing. The Mas- 
sachusetts legislature is called a Parliament, 
and the close of its annual session is referred 
to as a prorogation. The Old South Church 
figures as the Old South Chapel. The writer 
speaks of driving up the side of Lake Wachusett 
to the hotel at its summit, evidently meaning 
Mount Wachusett. But taken all in all, we 
shall not soon chance upon a more thoroughly 
^yholesome, helpful, entertaining, and instruc- 
tive biography than this account of the life and 
labors of John Bellow;?. Percy F. Bickn^ell. 



Problems of the American City.* 

Our most kindly foreign critic, Mr. James 
Bryce, told us twenty years ago that the one 
great failure of American politics was munic- 
ipal government. The statement was not chal- 
lenged at the time, as it was the popular 
opinion of the American people, who con- 
fessed, with chagrin or indifference, that in 
American cities democracy had failed. 

During the last two decades we have wit- 
nessed an amazing change. Municipal govern- 
ment has grown more efficient and less cor- 
rupt, while national and state governments 
have in many instances gro^vn less efficient and 
more corrupt. To-day the hope of democracy is 
in the city, as one cannot doubt who reads Dr. 
Wilcox's book with the attention it deserves. 
The author has had a wide range of experience, 
both as student and municipal reformer; not 
the least of his advantages having been that 
of participating in the recent struggle of Grand 
Kapids for civic righteousness. Dr. Wilcox 
states this problem in democracy in a logical 
and scientific manner, indicating the signifi- 
cance of the growth of cities; the place which 
industry occupies in determining the conditions 
of self-government; the fundamental impor- 
tance in the city of the street and the public 
utilities; the dependence of citizenship upon 
civic education, the control of leisure, and 
cooperation; the significance of local organiza- 
tion, and the importance of municipal home- 
rule. The investigation concludes with a 
practical discussion of municipal finance and a 
suggested programme of civic effort. 

The great merits of the book are an apprecia- 
tion of the difficulties and possibilities of 
democratic administration, and a minute knowl- 
edge of the details of civic life. The author is 
equally sound in his discussion of the vexed 
problem of regulating vice, the immense pos- 
sibilities of the public schoolhouse or other civic 
centre, the relative importance of mayor and 
coTincil, executive and legislative functions, and 
the value of modern democratic devices, such 
as the initiative referendum, proportional rep- 
resentation, and the recall. The author is thor- 
ough-going and courageous in his democracy. 
He says: 

' It is fitting that in the study of city conditions 
and municipal government in the United States we 
should strive to comprehend the relation existing 
between democracy and this marvellous phenom- 
enon, the city, looming so large upon our horizon 
and dominating more and more our whole political, 
industrial and social life. Democracy has not been 
fully tested, and its record of achievement is such 
that we, of modern days, believe its ultimate failure 
would mean the failure of progress itself. To us 
the right of every man to count for what he is 
really worth has come to be an essential part of the

justification of life. We look upon the egregious 
blunders of our cities and listen to Mr. Bryce's oft- 
repeated dictum about the " one conspicuous fail- 
ure " amoUfj our institutions, and still maintain 
that what we need is not less democracy but more. 

* We see that the experiment of democracy must 
be begun over again under the changed conditions 
of industrial and social life, and that in the new 
experiment cities must take the lead. That thus far 
democracy has failed to justify itself in the cities 
of America is commonly believed. Yet 'm 
in the nature of the case the richest field for democ- 
racy and in them the principle of political co-opera- 
tion may be carried furthest. If the people prove 
themselves worthy of political power, municipal 
institutions will surely lead the van in the political 
progress of the world.' 

The book is so valuable that it would seem 
ungracious to point out minor flaws, were it 
not that they can he remedied in the subse- 
quent editions. Dr. Wilcox occasionally takes 
liberties with his English, misleading the reader 
by failing to use words in their current signif- 
icance. The chapter on ' The Control of Leis- 
ure ' deals not only with recreative institutions, 
but discusses (with much acumen, it must be 
admitted) gambling, prostitution, and public 
baths. ' Municipal Insurance ' is a term which 
covers the fire and police departments, boiler 
inspection, tenement houses, and pure water, 
— giving a rhetorical twist to a terra which 
technically applies to the municipality's pro- 
tection of its own property. The chapters on 
' Civic Education ' and ' A Programme of 
Civic Effort' are satisfactorily described in 
the titles ; but ' Civic Cooperation ' is a phrase 
used to describe municipal activities in another 
chapter. These defects are worthy of notice 
only because they are anomalous in the pages 
of a writer with such a fund of information 
and such clear vision as the author of ' The 
American City.' Charles Zueblin. 



The Currency Question usr 
Retrospective.* 

So abundant has been the literature on 
money and monetary history during the past 
decade that a writer who ventures to-day to 
enter this field must feel confident that he has 
either something very important to say, or else 
the power of presenting his materials in a way 
peculiarly fascinating to the reader, if he hopes 
to secure a wide audience for the message he 
brings. Judged by this standard, Mr. Hep-

burn's ' History of Coinage and Currency in the 
United States ' is not likely to run through 
many editions. The author is perhaps right 
in his belief that ' there is no one work of con- 
venient size and popular character covering 
the history of the coinage and currency of the 
United States, with data and details in chrono- 
logical order, available as a book of reference,' 
though Professor Dewey's ' Financial Historj- 
of the United States ' fulfils the first part of 
this expressed need in an admirable manner. 
As a ' book of reference, ' Mr. Hepburn's volume 
certainly has value, though it may l)e suggested 
that for this purpose the first part of the title 
would appeal more to sober students of the 
subject than the more aggressive second part 
which appears on the back of the volume. It 
is to be feared that the book can not make 
clear it« claim to be ' a work of popular char- 
acter,' for Mr. Hepburn's history is for the 
most part a colorless one, and the author's style 
is not such as to make up for this lack of 
critical comment. 

The earlier chapters, on the Coinage System, 
are chiefly a recital of well known events, with- 
out much attempt to point out their signifi- 
cance. The author gives an interesting expla- 
nation of the reason why the legal ratio of 16 
to 1 was adopted in 1834-37, when the ratio 
between silver and gold was changed from 15 
to 1. The ratio to which most European 
bimetallic countries adhered was I5I/2 to 1, and 
this was also not far removed from the market 
ratio; but Mr. Hepburn asserts that Congress 
knowingly undervalued silver, hoping thereby 
to draw to this country gold from Central and 
South America, as well as to retain the output 
of the new gold-mines then being opened up in 
North Carolina and Georgia. Benton, Calhoun, 
and John Quincy Adams all supported the new 
ratio; and the above explanation indicates that 
in so doing they believed that they were in fact 
establishing the gold standard. Such indeed 
proved to be the case, since the coinage of silver 
dollars practically ceased from that date. 

In his review of the history of State Banking 
between 1837 and 1849, the author has brought 
together and summarized the researches of sev- 
eral essayists; and this is one of the best and 
most readable portions of his book. He attrib- 
utes the partial failure of the New York 
Safety-fund system at this time to the fact that 
the fund was made applicable not only to the 
note circulation but to all the indebtedness of 
the banks, and is unwilling to believe that these 
failures point to any defects in the Safety- 
fund system of protecting note holders. 

Mr. Hepburn gives to Mr. Windom, by impli- 
cation at least, the credit for having originated 
the Silver-purchase act of 1890, since he 
resrards the so-called Sherman act as merelv

Congressional tinkering with the Windom meas- 
ure. In this connection, Secretary Windom 
himself comes in for this somewhat doubtful 
compliment : 

* He wouM no doubt have favored the soundest 
system of money had it been politic to do so, but 
it was not, in his judgment, wise to fly in the face 
of the people. Few men could have so skilfully 
devised a plan calculated to satisfy the silver advo- 
cates, the Grcienbackers, the gold men, and the infla- 
tionists, as well as those who favored contraction. ' 

In a work like the present one, written by 
a man who has himself been actively engaged 
in administering the laM's of M'hich he treats, 
our chief interest is in his opinions concerning 
the efficiency of legislation for current needs. 
Mr. Hepburn gives us such a summary of his 
views in the last twenty pages of his text; and, 
though we read them with interest, and with 
due respect for the authority with which they 
are presented, it cannot be said that they reveal 
anything that is strikingly new or wholly con- 
vincing. Bimetallism he considers to be a 
moribund issue; but he fears that in times of 
business stagnation the existence of the large 
silver coinage in our currency may prove a 
menace which can only be guarded against hy 
continuing a large Treasury surplus into which 
the silver may be thrown. The danger is in- 
creased by the presence of the Greenbacks; but, 
on the other hand, it is lessened by the need for 
this currency in every-day transactions, and for 
bank reserves. The Sub-treasury system re- 
ceives, of course, its due share of criticism for 
producing a monetary stringency whenever the 
Federal revenues are largely in excess of expen- 
ditures, and there is presented once more the 
banker's plan of salvation, — the deposit of the 
government funds in the banks of reserve cities. 
We are also reminded that a -bank currency 
based on bond security will always be non- 
elastic, and that both security and elasticity can 
be secured by means of a Safety-fund system, 
and by a guarantee fund provided by means of 
taxation. The experiences of the German 
Keichsbank and of the Canadian banks are 
relied upon for proofs of this latter assertion. 

The character of Mr. Mitchell's ' History of 
the Greenbacks ' will be appreciated when it is 
stated that it has already taken rank as the 
standard treatise on this interesting and im- 
portant epoch of our monetary and financial 
history. Not only is the investigation thorough 
and well-nigh exhaustive for the period it cov- 
ers, but, aside from the rather tedious analysis 
of the statistics of wages and prices, the mat- 
ter is presented in an attractive style. The sig- 
nificant fact which is revealed by the author's 
account of the conditions at the opening of the 
war is that the low credit of the government 
at this time, of which the apologists for the 
Greenback legislation have made so much, was 



not due to inability to get revenue so much as 
it was to Secretary Chase's determination not 
to resort to taxation as a means of carrying on 
the war. It seems also to have been demon- 
strated that the $150,000,000 loan of 1861 was 
not the cause of the suspension of specie pay- 
ments, as has often been averred; for Mr. 
Mitchell shows that the banks were not seriously 
inconvenienced by this demand, since the dis- 
bursements of the government were so rapid 
that the specie soon returned to the banks. It 
was Secretary Chase's annual report showing 
a disappointing condition of the government 
finances, coupled with the uneasiness caused by 
the Trent affair, which produced the panic in 
the New York markets and compelled suspen- 
sion. 

The plea of necessity which was potent in 
producing the legal-tender acts, and which has 
been accepted as an excuse by many a writer 
since that time, is here shown to have had 
force only in so far as it reveals the unwilling- 
ness of Congress and of the Secretary to sell 
bonds for what they would bring in the open 
market. In this connection it is well to remem- 
ber Mr. Fessendon's answer to those who 
claimed that the government ought not to pay 
over six per cent for money. ' Money in the 
market,' he replied, 'is always worth what it 
will sell for. It is an ai^ticle of merchandise, 
like anything else; and the government has no 
reason to suppose, unless it can offer much bet- 
ter security, that it should get money at a bet- 
ter rate than anybody else.' 

The economic consequences of the Green- 
back legislation can be only briefly alluded to; 
and, indeed, the full consequences cannot be 
realized from the history of these four years, 
as the author well recognizes. It is not sur- 
prising, of course, to learn that gold and silver 
coins disappeared from circulation, except in 
California, where there was a deep-seated prej- 
udice against all forms of paper money; but it 
does cause some wonder t<» find that the smaller 
coins, even those of nickel and bronze, were 
hoarded and commanded a premium. This 
premium was due, in the first instance, not to 
the high specie value of these coins, but to the 
great need for small change which resulted 
from the disappearance of the small silver coins. 
The ' shinplasters ' were soon called into requi- 
sition to supply this deficiency. 

The history of the Greenbacks does not, in 
Mr. Mitchell's opinion, tend to strengthen the 
position of the quantity theorists. A lengthy 
study of the fluctuations in the value of the 
currency leads him to the conclusion that 'the 
quantity of the Greenbacks influenced their 
specie value rather by affecting the credit of 
the government than by altering the volume 
of the circulatinsr medium. '

The author^s elaborate treatment of the 
movement of wages and prices during the war 
cannot be described here, nor can we devote 
space to his criticism of the materials with 
which he has had to deal, and the use of them 
by earlier investigators. We must content our- 
selves with the statement that his analysis and 
conclusions support the commonly accepted 
theory that changes in the value of the cur- 
rency are more quickly reflected in the move- 
ments of prices than in those of wages. This 
means that the wage-earners during the Civil 
War paid, on account of the Greenbacks, a cur- 
rency tax for the support of the war equal to 
' perhaps a fifth or a sixth of real incomes.' 
In reality, however, this can hardly be said to 
have been a tax, since the benefits accrued not 
to the government but to the employers, who 
found their profits swelled by the fact that 
prices rose more rapidly than wages. To a slight 
degree, the position of the wage-earner was 
rendered less serious by a rise of rents less rapid 
than the rise of prices. The final effect of the 
Greenbacks noted by Mr. Mitchell is the in- 
creased cost of the war due to this legislation. 
He calculates this additional expense to have 
been $791,000,000, while the addition to the 
war-debt due to the use of paper money was in 
the neighborhood of $589,000,000. This is a 
more conservative statement of the situation 
than has been furnished by the estimates of 
earlier writers. 

Mr. Margraff's book on ' International Ex- 
change' is not one which lends itself easily to 
the reviewer's art, since it is the author's pur- 
pose not to give a systematic presentation of 
the theory of foreign exchange, but rather ' gen- 
eral practical information ' of especial value to 
bankers and exporters and importers. The text 
is accordingly of a descriptive and explanatory 
character, discussing such subjects as foreign 
bills of exchange, letters of credit, foreign bank- 
ing systems, arbitrage, gold exports and im- 
ports, and the monetary systems of foreign 
countries. The matter is clearly presented, 
without any waste of words, and would prove 
interesting and instructive to a much wider 
circle of readers than that for which it is 

primarily intended. M. B. Hammond.

A delightful 
biography of 
Miss Edge-worth. 



Timely to the newly awak- 
ened interest in Irish litera- 
ture, which is gradually broad- 
ening to include more than modern mysticism, 
comes another volume in the 'English Men of 
Letters' series (Macmillan) upon Maria Edge- 
worth. It is appropriately written by her dis- 
tinguished coim try- woman, the Hon. Emily Law- 



less. Miss Lawless explains that ail Miss Edge- 
worth 's other biographies have been English, with 
the result that the purely Irish side of her writ- 
ings, and their influence in Ireland itself, have 
been pretty much neglected. It is upon her atten- 
tion to these matters, and her use of some hith- 
erto unpublished letters, that the author relies 
for novelty and interest in a field already well 
explored; but in reality it is her own personality 
that gives the greatest charm to her work, — her 
quick humor, her strong power to vivify a situa- 
tion or a character, her gift of lively narration, 
her command of fine nervous English. It is as 
a very loveable woman, rather than as a success- 
ful authoress, that Miss Edgeworth interests her 
biographer; and she certainly draws a delightful 
picture of Maria in her father's home, with its 
bewildering succession of wives and its seventeen 
children. There was little opportunity for soli- 
tude there, between children and Richard Lovell 
Edgeworth 's theories; but this did not disturb 
Maria. She wrote apparently just as she did 
dozens of other things in the busy day's round, 
and submitted her work to her father exactly as 
she would have submitted any other household 
affair to him. Miss Lawless has more sympathy 
for Mr. Edgeworth than some previous commen- 
tators, although she admits that he did his worst 
for Maria by blunting her never strong imagina- 
tion and insisting upon the moral issues of every 
tale. She wonders how he even let the utterly 
un-moral 'Castle Rackrent' escape his censorship. 
This she considers not only by far Maria's best 
book, but the best story that ever came out of 
Ireland, The friendship with Scott, and the 
exchange of visits between Abbotsford and Edge- 
worthstown, form one of the most interesting 
episodes of Miss Edgeworth 's later life. Alto- 
gether we feel that Miss LaAvless fully proves her 
point,— namely, that Miss Edgeworth, though 
not of course in the first rank as a writer, stands 
in what is perhaps quite as enviable a position 
as 'one of the very pleasantest personalities to 
be met with in the whole wide world of books. ' 

For some years past, the Biblical 
play has held the stage of pub- 
lie attention and commercial 
success when the play of contemporary setting 
and current thought has often had but a brief 
and inconspicuous life. The latest addition to 
the growing fund is Miss Florence Wilkinson's 
'Two Plays of Israel' (McClure, Phillips & Co.). 
The longer of them, 'David of Bethlehem,' is the 
work of several years, and is said to be the first 
of the recent plays concerned with that subject. 
There seems to be some possibility that it will be 
seen on the stage, Mr. E. H. Sothern having 
bought the dramatic rights to it some years ago. 
The second play in the volume is entitled 'Mary 
Magdalen,' and is much less considerable, in 
various respects, than its companion. In Biblical 
plays, as in the case of all stories that belong to 
the common fund of history and tradition, the 
thread and denouement of the story are virtually 
known in advance. This places an extra burden 
on the new interpreter, since the appeal of nar- 
rative interest can no longer be paramount.

Phillips and D'Annmizio, Crawford and Boker, 
had but the slender thread of Dante's story from 
which to weave their delicate and extensive fabric 
of dramatic texture. The charm and virtue of 
each play lay in the individual vitality which 
each author poured into the meagre mould of 
fact. Miss Wilkinson has proved inadequate to 
accomplish with noteworthy success this most 
difficult feat of dramatic art. In 'David of Beth- 
lehem,' the structure itself is not well mortised; 
the constituent parts are not in themselves well 
poised. The incidents and situations designed to 
hold the spectator are seldom powerfully di-a- 
matic, smacking more of stage craft than of dra- 
matic art. The diction in many places is absurdly 
inappropriate. Such sentences as *Ay, a good 
dream for them as find it good, but a bad dream 
for some others' by the witch whom Saul con- 
sults, 'It do so, Lady Miehal, and that puts me 
in mind of my herbs for Hurai' by the old gar- 
dener in Act. II., and other like expressions, sug- 
gest the idea that David Harum 's vernacular has 
remained unchanged from the time of David until 
our own day. The second of the two plays, 'Mary 
Magdalen,' is pitched more in a key of poetry 
than the other, and contains passages that are 
not devoid of beauty. But from the dramatic 
standpoint, the play has one fatal flaw. The 
crucial moment, the decision at the crisis, is 
lamentably weaK, because there is no suggestion 
that the controlling motive in that decision has 
a profound physical, moral, or spiritual basis and 
cause, as in the case of 'La Samaritaine' or 
'Mary of Magdala.' Although this play is freer 
from verbal and phrasal incongruities than its 
predecessor, it is hard to forgive Miss Wilkinson 
for accrediting Philip, the Tetrarch, with the 
coinage of such a nineteenth-century word as 
'crassly.' 

Mr. N. Kilburn, in a prefatory 
note to 'The Story of Chamber 
Music' (imported by Scribner), 
asks the question as to which of the great forms 
of musieaJ composition we would plead for in 
case all the rest were doomed to destruction. 
'Music for the orchestra, with its vivid colours, 
its strength and delicacy ; the vast range of choral 
music; works for the organ, that huge modern 
plexus of pipe and reed,— these and others no 
doubt have strong claims on our musical affec- 
tions. But, if forced to such a choice, it is cer- 
tain that many a musician would, without hesita- 
tion, pledge himself to uphold the claims of cham- 
ber music; for who can measure the almost infi- 
nite variety and charm which it affords, and that 
too with the slenderest means?' The term cham- 
ber music, strictly speaking, embraces composi- 
tions in the form of duets, trios, quartettes, and 
other larger combinations, for strings (i. e., vio- 
lins, violas, 'cellos, and double basses), and for 
wind instruments, both with and without the 
pianoforte. In the treatise mentioned, the author 
has traced the beginnings of chamber music, 
which originated very early in the sixteenth 
century, and follows minutely the development 
of this class of composition, to which nearly all 
great composers have contributed their share. 



The story of 
chamber music. 



Regarding the present-day tendency, Mr. Kilburn 
laments that many chamber works are written 
too much in orchestral style, and that there has 
arisen an inclination on the part of some com- 
posers to make this form express more than it 
seems naturally fitted to do, to introduce the 
programme idea into chamber music — such as 
Raff's Op. 192, 'Die Schone Mullerin,' and Sme- 
tana's 'Aus meinem Leben.' The present volume 
is undoubtedly the most complete work on the 
subject extant, and is the result of painstaking 
research and study. A chronological and bio- 
graphical appendix adds to its value. 



French romantic The translation of 'Main Cur- 
writersofthe rents of Nineteenth Century 

last century. Literature,' the great critical 

work of Dr. Georg Brandes, goes on apace. We 
have already reviewed the first three volumes of 
this translation, and the fifth now appears from 
the press of the Messrs. Macmillan,— the fourth, 
on 'Naturalism in England,' having been for the 
moment postponed. The subject of this fifth vol- 
ume is 'The Romantic School, in France,' thus 
forming the necessary sequence to 'The Reaction 
in Prance,' which is the subject of the third vol- 
ume. The history now proceeds, after a recapit- 
ulation of the political and social conditions, 
the influences domestic and foreign, that shaped 
the generation of 1830, to discuss at length the 
work of Nodier, Vigny, Hugo, Musset, George 
Sand, Balzac, Beyle, Merimee, Gautier, and 
Sainte-Beuve. These ten authors have one or 
more chapters each (Balzac and Merimee no less 
than six apiece), and their work is discussed upon 
the broadest historical and philosophical basis. 
Three or four closing chapters sum up the period, 
gathering up the loose ends of the discussion, 
and supplying matters 'overlooked and forgot- 
ten' in the preceding chapters. This volume is 
probably the ablest section of the great critical 
work to which it belongs. The author's closing 
words describe the French romantic school as 
'the greatest literary school of the nineteenth 
century,' and his treatment fairly makes good 
the claim, showing, as it does, how in all direc- 
tions, this influence 'revitalised style,' and 'insin- 
uated itself as a fertilising power into the science 
of history, as an inspiring power into politics.' 
The volume is throughout written con amore, and 
displays, if possible, deeper insight and firmer 
grasp than its predecessors. It is indispensable 
to the serious student of modern literature. 



A book on 
17th century 
manners. 



'Social Life under the Stuarts' 
is the title of a rather amor- 
phous; volume written by 'Eliza- 
beth Godfrey' and imported by Messrs. E. P, 
Duttoii & Co. Upon examination, the Stuarts 
prove to be the first two Kings of that name, 
and the social life includes anything relating to 
the manners and customs of the upper classes, 
from gossip, dress, and amusements in town and 
country, to such weighty matters as science, art, 
music, iitei-ature, and religion. Practically this 
volume is a continuation of a previous one on the 
home-life of the same period, only that its scope 
is slightly broader. As before, the material is

THE PTALi 



[Sept. 1&, 



drawn chiefly from the letters, memoirs, and 
diaries which best miiTor the private life of the 
time,— George Herbert, Izaak Walton, Lady 
Brilliana Harley, Herrick, Endymion Porter, and 
Evelyn, being a few of the authorities oftenest 
quoted. With such liet^rogeneous subject-mat- 
ter, little unity is possible, except that the writer 
tries to limit her outlook to that of the eultui-ed 
man or woman of the day. The result, since the 
book wholly lacks distinction of style, is rather 
overpowering; but as a reference work, putting 
into accessible and fairly popular form a good 
deal of hitherto unobtainable material, as well 
as some more familiar, it will fill a niche in many 
libraries. As citation is generally made verbatim, 
accuracy is of course ensured. Twenty illustra- 
tions from old prints and engravings form one 
of the most interesting features of the book. 



Literature of 
the Dark Ages. 



After much delay, a new volume 
has been added to the series of 
'Periods of European Litera- 
ture' (Scribner). It has for its subject 'The 
Dark Ages,' and thus comes first in the chrono- 
logical order, although it stands as ninth in the 
order of publication. When we say that it is the 
work of Professor W. P. Ker, little need be added 
by way of praise. The brilliant and accomplished 
author of 'Epic and Romance' has hardly an 
equal among English scholars in this field, and 
the present work is probably the best of the 
entire series. As was to be expected, the author 
has given much attention to early Teutonic litera- 
ture—Icelandic in particular,- treating of Old 
English in somewhat less detail by virtue of the 
fact that it is more familiar to the class of read- 
ers for whom this work is designed. The longest 
of the five chapters into which the book divides, 
nevertheless, is necessarily devoted to the Latin 
Avritings of the period covered, and here also we 
find displayed a thorough scholarship and a clear 
method of presentation. The treatment of Celtic 
poetry, although upon a closely restricted scale, 
is also satisfactoiy. Throughout the work, the 
author keeps in mind the interrelations between 
the several branches of the investigation, and 
fuses the disparate elements of his subject-matter 
into some degree of unity. In a word, he is 
successful in illuminating the darkest literai-y 
recesses of the centuries under discussion, and 
at the same time he contrives to give a touch of 
fresh interest to the dullest phases of his theme. 



The late Clarence King had 
Menwriai volume ^ genius for friendship, as is 

to Clarence King. ,° . j i . i • i i 

attested by the memorial vol- 
ume recently prepared by his friends, and pub- 
lished by the Messrs. Putnam for the Century 
Association. His literary baggage was of the 
slightest, for we may hardly describe as literature 
his geological papers or his work done for the 
Government survey of the Fortieth Parallel; but 
his personality seems to have made the deepest 
kind, of an impression upon his associates. One 
volume bearing his name — his 'Mountaineering 
in the Sierra Nevada^-- may indeed be fairly 
described as belonging to literature, and has 
recently been given th6 honoi*s of a new edition. 



Rossetti as an 
English Man 
of Letters. 



The slight but charming sketch called 'The Hel- 
met of Mambrino,' published in the 'Century' 
magazine, is also literature, and occupies tbe place 
of honor in the present memorial volume. But 
the greater part of the volume is given up to per- 
sonal contributions embodying reminiscences of 
its subject. That these papers are highly readable 
is sufficiently attested by the names of their writ- 
ers, among whom are included Messrs. John Hay,! 
W. D. Howells, Henry Adams, John La Farge, E> 

C. Stedman, W. C. Brownell, Edward Cary, and 

D. C. Gilman. A fonnal biogi-aphy by Mr. B. W. 
Raymond, some memorabilia by Mr. James D» 
Hague, and a technical paper on King as a geol- 
ogist by Mr. S. F. Emmons, complete the contents 
of this interesting and beautifully-printed book. 
There are also a number of illustrations, mainly 
portraits of King at various ages and in various 
surroundings. 

If Mr". Arthur Benson's volume 
on Rossetti in the ' English Men 
of Letters' series (Ma<?millan) 
has veiy little of the fascination belonging to 
other biogi'aphies of the poet-painter, the absence 
of this quality is deliberate. Mr. Benson gives 
hearty assent to the statement that Rossetti 's 
life has been treated by previous biographers 
'too much in the Pre-Raphaelite manner.' Vast 
masses of detail have been presented, interesting 
in themselves but obscuring the central figure; 
and the morbid and decadent elements of Ros- 
setti 's ehai*aeter have been emphasized almost to 
the exclusion of his brave and genial manliness. 
No doubt this is quite true, and perhaps nobpdy 
could have written a brief and business-like biog- 
raphy of Rossetti, treating him as an English 
Man of Letters, any more satisfactorily than Mr. 
Benson has done. In his biographical chapters,, 
readers of the Memoir, the Lettei-s, and the Diaries 
will feel a certain lack of environment and atmos- 
phere, a dimness of outline, a cautious verbal 
accuracy, that leaves them cold where they were 
wont to be most enthusiastic. Equally painstak- 
ing and far more satisfactory are the expository 
chapters dealing with the poems, translations, 
and pictures. Mr. Benson is a keen analyst, an 
appreciative and illuminating critic. For the 
facts about Rossetti and a clear presentation of 
his work one need not go further than this vol- 
ume, whose disappointments are, after all, proba- 
bly inevitable. ^_ 

History of To trace a histoiy of the begin- 

the beginnings gings of music, from the vai«ue 

ofuhisic. researches of antiquarians, and 

from pereonal investigations of rock carving's,, 
paintings, marbles and sculpture, papjTi and 
parchments, etc., has been the laborious task of 
Mr. Hermann Smith in 'The World's Earliest 
Music' (Scribner). As music is bound up with 
the manners and lives of peoples and nations, its 
courses of development cannot rightly be judged 
apart from geography, ethnography, and history. 
The autlior of the present work has devoted a 
long life to his subject, especially to the instru- 
ments that made the music, their construction and 
scientific bearings and , i*^lations, practically and 
exi>erimeutally ; thus it has happened, as he him-

THE DIAJL

self points out, that many advantages seldom 
combined have favored the pursuit of the inves- 
tigations discursively related in the present vol- 
ume. To those students of music who give to 
the art most sincere and earnest thought, Mr. 
Smith's work will undoubtedly appeal, as similar 
works have appealed before. A sequel to the 
present book is contemplated, to be entitled 'Our 
Musical Inheritance. ' 



BRIEFER MENTION, 



Mr. Stephen Gwynn's little book on 'The Mas- 
ters of English Literature,' published by the Mac- 
millan Co., might find use as a school text-book, 
hut its aim is rather to enlist the interests of read- 
f-rs, particularly young readers, in the subject for 
its own sake, when not considered as a form of 
taskwork. Mr. Gwynn writes pleasingly and intel- 
ligently about the 'obligatory authors,' as he calls 
them, the authors of whom 'no educated man in 
the English-speaking world can afford to profess 
entire ignorance.' The book is not overweighted 
with learning, and is agreeably diversified by the 
introduction of representative extracts from the 
siuthors considered. 

The group of recent French writers who have 
turned their attention to the study of English lit- 
erature have a faculty of finding interesting sub- 
jects M'hich our own critics and historians seem to 
miss. The latest illustration of this proposition 
is offered by Dr. A. Barbeau's 'Une Ville d'Eaux 
Anglaise au'XVIITe Siecle' (Paris: Picard), further 
described as a study of 'La Soci^te Elegante et 
Litteraire k Bath sous la Eeine Anne et sous les 
Georges.' Xo one has done just this thing before, 
and M, Barbeau has now done it so well, basing his 
work upon so extensive an examination of source- 
material, that we fancy no one will be likely to try 
to better his example. The elaborate bibliography 
and index add greatly to the value of this interest- 
ing and scholarly production. 

'Chinese Made Easy,' by Messrs. Walter Brooks 
Brouner and Fung Yuet Mow, is a publication of 
the Macmillan Co. We doubt very much the possi- 
bility of making the Chinese language really 'easy,' 
but this handsomely-printed book will be a boon to 
students who are forced to acquire Chinese for mis- 
sionary or mercantile purposes. It has been printed 
in Leyden, and the last page is the first. Professor 
Herbert A. Giles contributes a preface, and assures 
liis readers that whoever masters the contents of 
the book 'will find himself well advanced on the 
road towards a good acquaintance with the Chi- 
nese language.' 

The Progressive Printing Co., New York, pub- 
lishes in a limited edition a thin volume of ' Gedichte 
von Georg Sylvester Viereck,' prefaced by a criti- 
cal appreciation from the hand of Mr. Ludwig 
Lewisohn. Herr Viereck is a young man of twenty, 
born in Munich of German-American parentage, 
and since 1897 a student in the schools of this 
country. His work is certainly remarkable, and 
we have read with interest every line of his volume. 
Ttr has color, passion, music, and imagination. It 
is verse shaped by the German influence of Heine 
and the English influence of Mr. Swinburne — not 
always to wholesome effect, we regret to say. One 
of the poems, at least, carries the expression of 
sensualism beyond what is permissible, and others 
are morbid in tendency. But we repeat that the 
work is remarkable, and promises much for its 
author's future. 



XOTES. 



A new and revised edition of the old morality 
play, 'The Life and Repentaunce of Marie Magda- 
lene,' edited by Prof. Frederic Ives Carpenter, is 
announced by the University of Chicago Press. 

It seems that the late Augustus C. Buell, at the 
time of his death last summer, had just completed 
an elaborate biography of Andrew Jackson, and 
the work will be published by Messrs. Scribner 
during the coming month. 

A new edition of 'Barnes' Popular History of the 
United States,' revised to date, and including 
illustrations of the Panama Canal and the Louisiana 
Purchase Exposition, has been prepared by Messrs. 
A. S. Barnes & Co. 

An edition for school use, of Tocqueville 's 
'L'Ancien Regime,' is published by Mr. Henry 
Frowde. Mr. G. W. Headlam is the editor, supply- 
ing an English introduction and notes to the 
French text and notes of the author. 

An illustrated edition of 'The Maiden and Mar- 
ried Life of Mary Powell' and 'Deborah's Diary,' 
with an introduction by the Rev. W. H. Hutton 
and drawings by Messrs. John Jellicoe and Her- 
bert Railton, is among the recent importations of 
the Messrs. Dutton. 

'British Poets of the Nineteenth Century' is 
the title of a work, to be published at once by 
Messrs. Benj. H. Sanborn & Co., designed to sup- 
ply in a single volume all the material required 
by students in school courses devoted to English 
poetry of the nineteenth century. 

A new and enlarged edition of 'The Study of 
Henry Esmond,' designed as an aid to the proper 
appreciation of Thackeray's novel, has just ap- 
peared in the 'Study-Guide Series,' prepared and 
published by H. A. Davidson. This useful series 
will be issued from Cambridge, Mass., in the future, 
instead of from Albany as heretofore. 

The H. W. Wilson Co. issues 'The Constitutions 
and Other Select Documents Illustrative of the 
History of France, 1789-1901,' as chosen and trans- 
lated by Professor Frank Maloy Anderson." The 
selection is comprehensive, filling over six hundred 
pages, and will be found of great usefulness by 
students of modern history and political science. 

'Japan Described by Great Writers' (Dodd, Mead 
& Co.) is a compilation recently made by Miss 
Esther Singleton. It deals with the various 
aspects of the country; its physical features; its 
customs and industries. The selections are inter- 
esting and the book as a whole fiirnishes one with 
an easy and convenient means of learning what 
Pierre Loti, Sir Edwin Arnold, and other writei-s 
of lesser note have had to say about Japan. 

'The New Star Chamber and Other Essays,' 
by Mr. Edgar Lee Masters, is sent us by the 
Hammersmark Publishing Co. It is a collection 
of forcibly written essays upon political subjects, 
containing much sound doctrine upon imperialism 
and the dangerous i>resent centralizing trend in 
our government. We regret that the effect of this 
excellent writing should be marred by the exces- 
sive radicalism evoked by other subjects, and 
by an occasional intemperance of statement. 

Following the recent assignment of the Lothrop 
Publishing Company comes the announcement that 
the entire assets and good-will of this corporation 
have been purchased by Messrs. Lee & Shepard, 
and that the business of the two houses will be 
combined under the title of The Lothrop, liee & 
Shepard Company. The affairs of the new cor- 
poration will be under the direction of Mr. Wdr-

ren F. Gregory, for the past six years manager for 
Messrs. Lee & Shepard. The two houses concerned 
iu this amalgamation have always made a distinct 
speciality of books for the young, and their com- 
bined resources will now give them the strongest 
list of juvenile literature offered by any house in 
the trade. 

Lovers of the Brownings and of Italy will hardly 
fail to welcome the forthcoming volume entitled 
'Florence in the Poetry of the Brownings,' in 
which Mrs. Anna B. McMahan has brought together 
the poems of Mr. and Mrs. Browning having to 
do with the art and history of Florence. Numerous 
illustrations from photographs and an introduction 
by the compiler are included in the volume, which 
will be published early next month by Messrs. A. 
C. McClurg & Co. 

Two volumes of considerable interest to students 
of American literature are included in Messrs. 
Scribner's Autumn list. One of the two is a biog- 
raphical, critical^ and illustrative treatment of 
the 'Literary Leaders of America,' prepared by 
Mr. Richard Burton. The other is a 'History of 
American Literature,' by Prof. Barrett Wendell 
and Mr. C. N. Greenough, — a revised and abridged 
Hdaptation, for the use of high schools and col- 
leges, of Prof. Wendell's well-known 'Literary 
History of America.' 

The prevailing interest in American historical 
sources finds new expression in a series projected 
by the A. Wessels Co., under the editorship of Mr. 
Kufus Eoekwell Wilson, to comprise annotated 
reprints of the most valuable and interesting items 
of rare Americana. The first three volumes, now 
nearly ready, consist of Andrew Burnaby's 
i' Travels through the Middle Settlements of North 
America, 1759-1760,' William Heath's 'Memoirs of 
the American War,' and a revised and enlarged 
edition of W. W. Canfield's 'Legends of the Iro- 
quois.' The volumes will include so far as possible 
fac-similes of the original illustrations and maps, 
and will be issued at a moderate price. 

The Thirteenth International Peace Congress will 
be held in Boston the first week of October. Judg- 
ing from the preliminary announcements already 
made, the gathering will be one of exceptional 
importance. The foreign delegates certainly form 
a distinguished company, including, among many 
others, such eminent persons as Sir John Macdonell, 
Mr. Gustave Hubbard, M. Charles Wagner, Count 
Albert Apponyi, the Bishops of Hereford and Ripon, 
Mr. W. R. Cremer, Professor Quidde, M. Emile 
Arnaud, Professor Langlois, Dr. Adolph Richter, 
and the Baroness von Suttner. Among the dis- 
tinguished Americans who will take part in the pro- 
gramme are Messrs. Andrew D. White, John Hay, 
and Oscar C. Straus. Reduced rates are offered 
by nearly all the railways. 

The 'Letters from an American Farmer' which 
was published in London more than a century ago 
by J. Hector St. .John Crevecoeur, has been, if not 
exactly a forgotten book, at least an unduly neg- 
lected one. The work certainly deserves the resus- 
citation that has now been given it by Messrs. 
Fox, Duffield & Co., who have made a handsome 
reprint of the original London edition. Professor 
W. P. Trent, in his 'American Literature,' first 
revived our interest in this book, and he now writes 
an introduction for the edition, which has other- 
wise been prepared by Mr. Ludwig Lewinsohn. 
The editor has also done what he could to recon- 
struct the life of the author, but the facts pre- 
served concerning him make only a meagre show- 
ing. There is an appendix of letters written by 
and about him to no less a personage than Ben- 
jamin Franklin. 



AXNOUNCEMEXTS OF FALI. BOOKS. 

Herewith is presented The Dial's list of books 
announced for publication this Fall, — as usual the 
earliest comprehensive and classified information- 
given to the public regarding the important forth- 
coming books of the present season. Entry is here 
made of more than twelve hundred titles, repre- 
senting the season's output of sixty leading Amer- 
ican publishers. The list has been prepared from 
advance information secured especially for this 
purpose. All the books entered are presumably 
new books — new editions not being included un- 
less having new form or matter; and, with a few 
necessary exceptions, the list does not include Fall 
books already issued and entered in our regular 
List of New Books. While no attempt has been 
made to include titles as titles merely, regardless 
of their significance or interest to our readers, yet 
it is believed that no really important book is 
missing from this list. Some of the more interest- 
ing features of the list are commented on in the 
leading editorial in this issue of The Dial.

A TALE OF TWO HEMISPHERES 

Illustrations by George Gibbs and E. W. Deming 

In this new story by this popular author will be found a plot entirely different from anything 
he has previously done, but of the most intense and exciting interest. It begins with a most 
strange complication at a frontier post in the Black Hills of Dakota shortly before the out- 
break of the Spanish War. The leading characters are then transported to far distant scenes 
in the Philippines, and the closing chapters bring them and the story back to America. It is 
in three parts : 

Part I. WHAT HAPPENED IN THE WEST 
Part II. WHAT HAPPENED IN THE EAST 
Part III. WHAT HAPPENED IN THE END 

The reader will renew acquaintance with some old friends and will be richly entertained by the 
experiences of men and women of army life, which none can better depict than this charming 
writer. Published in one style of binding only. i2mo. 340 pages. $i.jO^ usual discounts.

PRESS COMMENTS 

This is the moat substantial and valuable work on its sub- 
ject yet produced in our country. Scholarly, scientific, thor- 
ough, it is an inductive study of the first importance to every 
student of the primary social question— the question of the 
famUy. — The Outlook. 

In the three volumes which constitute this monumental 
work the learned author has provided the first adequate treat- 
ment of the history of human marriage. . . . The volumes 
bear on every page the marks of wide and painstaking scholar- 
ship. — Quarterly Journal of Economics. 

The general reader will peruse the text with sustained 
interest ; he will experience little difficulty in following the 
author's argument or in appreciating the force and significance 
of his conclusions. The scholar will find in the numerous 
footnotes, the extensive bibliography, and the carefully exe- 
cuted index, many additional points of excellence. — The Dial. 

There can be no broader or more complex subject for liter- 
ary discussion than the development of the human institution 
called the family. Innumerable are the problems presented. 
From the remote past the topic bristles with difficulties. The 
laws relating to marriage and divorce are most complex. The 
author of " A History of Matrimonial Institutions," who has 
thus imposed on himself a stupendous task, has certainly 
accomplished his work in a satisfactory manner. — The New 
York Times. 

Dr. Howard's elaborate study of matrimonial institutions 
and legislation affecting alike the binding and the dissolution of 
the tie is probably the most important work that has appeared 
on this subject in America.— The Churchman, New York. 

These volumes must '.ong be considered both as authorita- 
tive in statement and as a stimulus to future monographs. . . . 
Professor Howard has accomplished his task in philosophical 
and historical spirit ; with a clearness of statement that inspires 
confidence and respect ; with the controlled enthusiasm of one 
that is master of his subject and not mastered by it. The work, 
as a vast storehouse of well arranged facts, is an honor to 
American scholarship. — Boston Herald. 

No student of matrimonial institutions can afford to over- 
look this work. The amount of learning condensed in Dr. 
Howard's three volumes is enormous. The bibliographical 
index alone occupies about 140 pages and the author's foot- 
notes furnish conclusive proof that the innumerable authorities 
have been not only consulted but thoroughly examined. The 
task must have exacted the assiduous labor of many years. 
— New York Sun. 

As a whole, this work is singularly comprehensive, clear, 
open-minded, progressive and authoritative. It is an interest- 
ing and dignified historical monograph. — The Chicagro 
Record-Herald.

pages. Net, $3.50, 

" The most systematic and in many respects the most valuable work in the English language on the history of political thought. . . . 
The author furnishes us in this volume with a clear analysis of the opinions and most important writings from Cicero down to Hincmar 
of Rheims. He emphasizes the difference in political theory between Aristotle and Cicero. . . . The book is one of the most important 
results of historical research that has as yet been brought into print, and no student of the Middle Ages or of politics can afford to dis- 
regard it." — London Athenaeum.

" The reader who cares to understand the American Civil War should certainly read Mr. Olmsted's ' Seaboard Slave States.' His 
volumes present as interesting a picture of the South on the eve of its great catastrophe as is given by Arthur Young of France on the

A YEAR OF CONTINENTAL 

LITERATURE. 

I. 

As in previous years, we publish, in this and 
the following number of The Dial a summary 
of the series of special articles on the Continen- 
tal literature of the past twelvemonth contrib- 
uted to ' The Athenaeum ' by various writers. 
Our English contemporary has chosen to post- 
pone the publication of these articles from its 
first July issue to its first September issue, 
which makes possible a more nearly complete 
survey of the annual product, and also accounts 
for the belated appearance of our own summa- 
ries. The condensations which follow are from 
Professor Fredericq writing for Belgium, Dr. 
Tille for Bohemia, Dr. Ipsen for Denmark, M. 
Pravieux for France, and Dr. Heilbom for 
Germany. 

Belgian literature, as is well known, comes in 
both the French and the Flemish languages; 
and Professor Fredericq reports important 
works of both kinds. In the drama, Mr. Eafael 
Verhulst's ' Jesus de Nazarener ' and ' Reinaert 
de Vos ' are of the first interest, the former of 
these plays bringing ' the Gospel story before 
us with a devoutness of feeling and a respect 
for the great personality of Christ which makes 
us almost forget the audacity of the author.' 
' A Pastor,' by Mr. Jan Bruylants, ' paints the 
ideal portrait of a Catholic priest in a Flemish 
village, who refuses to soil his robe in the mire 
of political dissension and opens his arms to 
the repentent sinner.' 'Rina,' by Mr. Lodewijk 
Scheltjens, the dramatist of the proletariat, is 
called ' one of the most powerful works which 
have been put on the Flemish stage in our 
time.' Among books of French verse, we note 
the veteran M. E. Picard's ' Ainsi Nait, Vit, 
Meurt I'ximour' and M. E. Verhaeren's ' Les 
Tendresses Premieres.' In fiction, the first book 
to be mentioned is ' Les Cadets de Brabant,' by 
M. Leopold Courouble, the creator of the Kake- 
broek family. The best of the year's fiction 
is Flemish, and includes the following works. 
' The Burgomaster of x^ntwerp,' by Mr. Pol de 
Mont, 'is the story of a legendary Bluebeard 
who wished successively to murder his seven 
wives.' 'The Tranquil Constellation,' by Mr, 
Herman Teirlinck, is ' a sing-ularly penetrating 
picture of the life and sentiments of the down- 
trodden peasants of Flanders.' Mr. Stijn 



196 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



Streuvels, in ^Village Love/ has produced his 
first long novel, ' a work full of supple strength 
and picturesque realism/ Mr. Cyriel Buysse's 
' After Marriage ' ' probes the inmost heart of a 
young husband. A gifted painter, wealthy and 
artistic, he has married a woman who does not 
understand him, and who deceives him in the 
most vulgar manner possible.' Miss Virginie 
Loveling, ' for many years at the head of Flem- 
ish literature in Belgium, ' has written * The 
Apple of Discord,' a deeply original work which 
describes ' the struggle, so frequent in Flanders, 
between a free-thinking father and a mother 
rigidly determined on the moral and religious 
education of their child.' Works of history, 
biography, and social science are numerous, but 
none of them seem to be of a nature to attract 
much attention outside of the country in which 
they have been written. 

Dr. V. Tille, -^vriting of Bohemian letters, 
tells us that 'an ever-growing endeavour after 
a modern national novel and a raising of the 
drama, be it on liistorical or social basis, stands 
in the foreground.' The most important 
attempts to produce a modem national novel 
are Mr. Simacek's ' Hungry Hearts ' and Mr. 
Sova's ' Expeditions of the Poor.' The new 
drama is illustrated by ' Princes,' a tragedy of 
the Bohemian middle ages, the work of Mr. 
Vrchlieky, the foremost Bohemian poet. It 
' represents in strong lines the horrors of fratri- 
cidal strife for a throne.' Another drama of 
high rank is Mr. Kvapil's ' Clouds/ which ' rep- 
resents a young Eoman Catholic theologian who 
falls in love with a famous actress, his play- 
mate in childliood's years.' In verse, Mr. 
Maehar '' has made a, new sensation ' by four 
Iwoks of sonnets on the seasons, ' in which he 
treats a great variety of subjects in his original 
and sharply-pointed style,' while Vide circles 
of readers have been interested by Mr. F. X. 
Prochaska's " Songs of Hradcany/' which have 
gone through several editions.' Tlie new femin- 
ism is making its influence felt in Bohemian 
literature, and women figure conspicuously 
every year among the writers of fiction, poetiy, 
and the drama. 

Dr. Alfred Ipsen's review of Danish litera- 
ture has to do duty this year for the whole of 
Scandinavia, since reporte from both Norway 
and Sweden are missing. He notes the para- 
doxical fact that 'though the purchasers of 
books are getting fewer, the number of those 
who write them is constantly growing.' Every 
man his own author would seem to be the motto 
of literary aspirants in Denmark. Two novels 
of the year are entitled ' Babel ' ( Babylon ) , 
and clearly result from the recent achieve- 
ments of Oriental archasolog}'. One of them, 
by Herr Carl Kohl, is 'only a mass of dead 



fact^ and dead bones,' but the other, by Mr. 
Niels Hoffmeyer, is described as 'a most note- 
worthy human document,' suggested possibly 
by Mr. Sienkiewicz's ' Quo Vadis,' but ' a bet- 
ter book, more harmonious and powerful in its 
construction.' Another historical novel of inte- 
rest is ' Lasse Maansson,' by Herr P. F. Eist, 
which tells of the Swedish invasion of Den- 
mark in the seventeenth century. ' It is the 
story of Paul and Virginia again, but dressed 
in other garments and speaking another lan- 
guage.' Important novels of modern life are 
' Den Store Eros,' by Herr Svend Leopold, 
and ' Sidste Kamp,' by Herr Otto Rungs. The 
latter ' has undertaken the task of showing the 
extermination of the aristocracy in our demo- 
cratic time.' The life of the peasantry is illus- 
trated by ' Sind,' a tragic tale by a young cler- 
gyman, Herr Jacob Knudsen, and the relig- 
ious novel by ' Helligt ^gteskab, a plea for a 
sort of free love by Miss Ingeborg Maria Sick. 
Among works of scholarship. Professor Wim- 
raer's book on the runic monuments of Den- 
mark, now nearly completed, is of great value. 
Professor Hoffding's 'Modem Philosophers,' 
which deals with Wundt, Nietzsche, and other 
thinkers of our own time, and is a sequel to his 
fascinating 'History of Modern Philosophy,' 
will probably very soon find its way into the 
hands of English readers. 

The writer of the French survey is, as for 
several years past, M. Jules Pravieux, who says : 

' At the outset of this review of the literary 
year, I have again to note the variety of works and 
talent to be dealt with. It is no longer the age of 
a well-disciplined, well-ordered literature preserved 
by foreseeing regulations from the perils of indi- 
vidualism. Several French writers do not cease to 
deplore the fact, which must be again recorded, that 
we have no new school to replace the old. There 
are as many schools as artists. Should we regret 
it? Not so much as some would wish to do. All 
schools, like all systems, are necessarily restrictive. 
Our literature needs neither a new school nor a new 
formula. It needs nothing but original and genuine 
talent, and that this is not lacking in France at the 
present moment this rapid review of the literary 
movement will sufficiently prove.' 

The drama naturally occupies the first place, 
and the number of plays characterized is con- 
siderable, although only a small fraction of the 
thousand or more which, according to M. Clare- 
tie, are annually submitted to the Theatre Fran- 
cais. We have space to mention a few only. 
MM. Lavedan and Lenotre, in 'Yarennes/ 
have dealt with the episode of the flight and cap- 
ture of Louis XVI. MM. de Caillavet, de Flers, 
and Jeoffrin, in ' La Montansier,' have told the 
story of a famous actress of a hundred years 
ago." M. Paul Hervieu in 'Le Dedale,' has 
exploited the idea of 'the eternal vassalage of 
woman ' in a melodramatic manner. M. Mau- 
rice Donnav. in ' Le Eetour de Jerusalem,' 



1904.] 



THE DIAIi 



197 



' Tries to prove that there exists between the Jew- 
ish and the Aryan races so ingrained a discord, such 
a profound divergence of ideas and of sentiments, 
that the union of two beings belonging to these 
dissimilar races is doomed to unhappiness, and leads 
by an inevitable descent to rupture, if not hate, so 
that all fusion between them is chimerical and detri- 
mental. ' 

M. Albert Guinon, in 'Decadence/ portrays a 
similar racial conflict. M. Jean Moreas, in 
'Iphigenie has written a classical play of 
Euripidean inspiration. M. Jean Richepin, in 
'Falstaff/ has 'done with Shakespeare what 
Plantus and Terence did with Menander ' ; that 
is, he has made a single lengthy work, by selec- 
tion and combination, out of the Shakespearian 
material. It is interesting to learn that M. 
Pinero's 'The Second Mrs. Tanqueray' has 
had a well-deserved success on the Parisian 
stage. The ' poets in France are not moribund 
either from poverty or exhaustion,' as is attested 
by the annual production of six hundred or 
more volumes of new verse. Those of the past 
year include 'Lueurs et Flammes,' by Mile. 
Vacaresco; 'Les Visions Sinceres/ by M. 
Jacques Normand ; ' Les Roses de Laurier,' by 
M. Clovis Hugues ; ' La Cite des Eaux,' by M. 
Henri Regnier; ' Heures Lointaines,' by M. 
Paul Harel; ' L'Axchange des Batailles,' by 
M. Gaston Armelin ; and ' Terre Divine,' by M. 
Gustav Zidler. It is difficult, as M. Pravieux 
suggests, to make a judicious choice from the 
immense output of the year's fiction. M. de 
Vogue ' Le Maitre de la Mer ' is a novel that 
' brings forward one of the most vital questions 
of modern life — the conflict between two 
forces, militarism and patrit^tism on the one 
hand, ever demanding fresh worlds to conquer, 
so that the national flag may be planted there- 
on ; on the other the exclusively practical spirit, 
which trades with gold rather than sentiments.' 
The MM. Margueritte in their ' La Commune, 
bring to an end their series of novels upon the 
War of 1870 and its consequences. M. Fer- 
nand Dacre has woven into the web of ' La 
Race' a 'condensed and triumphant criticism 
of international theories.' In ' Le Vertige 
Passionnel,' by M. Rene Fath, we have 'a 
story of strong passions, in which, by means of 
a series of very bold situations, the reader is 
led up to a climax of somewhat mixed moral- 
ity.' A few ather novels are 'La Peur de 
Vivre,' by M. Henry Bordeaux; ' Bon Plaisir,' 
by M. de Regnier ;' Portraits d'A'ieules,' by M. 
Andre Lichtenberger ; and ' Trois Dots,' by M. 
d'Azambuja. It is evident, concludes the 
writer, 

' That of all classes of French literature to-day 
fiction is the most prolific. But at this point the 
public begins to manifest some signs of satiety, and 
turns with a curiosity which increases every year 
towards historical works, memoirs, and autobiogra- 



phies. All such writings are eagerly welcomed, and 
must indeed be mediocre to obtain no success. Yes; 
it almost seems as though the public were weary of 
fiction, and appreciated the certainty of truth which 
these narratives and descriptions offer. It seems, 
also, that the aesthetic education of the public has 
reached such a pitch that it can now extract for 
itself whatever possibilities of literary pleasure 
the raw material may contain, and that it prefers 
to do such work rather than receive it ready-made 
from a skilled artist. And however small the har- 
vest, the effort made, as well as the result attained, 
gives satisfaction.' 

Historical works of the year include M. Mas- 
son's 'IS'apoleon et Son Fils,' M. Stenger's 
'La Societe Frangaise pendant le Consulat,' 
and Cardinal Mathieu's ' Le Concordat de 
1801.' In literary criticism there is M. Brune- 
tiere's ' Cinq Lettres sur Ernest Renan,' reac- 
tionary, of course, but a masterly example of 
controversial writing ; M. F. Loliee's ' Histoire 
des Litteratures Compaxees ' ; M. E. Schure's 
' Precurseurs et Revoltes,' dealing with Shelley, 
Nietzsche, Ibsen, Maeterlinck, and others; and 
M. F. Veuillot's ' Les Predicateurs de la Scene,' 
which ' studies from the moral standpoint the 
trend of modern thought as depicted in the 
most favourably received modern plays.' M. 
Pravieux concludes his remarks by saying: 

' If in this review of the Literary production of 
the year I look for any general movement, I notice 
nearly everywhere — in fiction, the drama, and in 
other branches of intellectual activity — a very 
marked tendency towards the study of social 
problems. Literature is influenced by the revival 
which seems to be affecting the social, moral, and 
political world.' 

Dr. Ernest Heilborn, discoursing of things 
German, begins by saying that the great stage 
successes of the year have been, not new pro- 
ductions, but the ' Gotz ' of Goethe and the 
' Minna von Barnhelm ' of Lessing. The most 
significant of the new plays have been those 
which have ' attempted to solve the problem of 
life with a special view to the artist, or at least 
to the artistic temperament.' Herr Arthur 
Schnitzler has treated of this problem in ' Der 
Einsame Weg.' Herr von Hoffmansthal's 
' Electra ' is a Sophoclean drama which makes 
us ' feel what a contrast there is between the 
feeble, sickly sentiment of our moderns and the 
strength and purity of the ancients.' In his 
'Stella und Antonie,' Herr Bierbaum 'has 
turned to the poetry of the seventeenth and 
eighteenth centuries, listened to its music, and 
revived its graceful, lyrical atmosphere.' In 
Herr Frank Wedekind's ' So 1st das Leben,' a 
fanciful mixture of farce and tragedy, ' roman- 
ticism, with its audacious irony and its delight 
in popular song, comes to life once more.' Herr 
Hauptmann's latest play is 'Rose Berndt/ a 
Silesian tragedy, realistic in method, embody- 
ing ' the feeling of repeated and overwhelming 



198 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



suffering/ ' Der Strom/ by Herr Max Halbe, 
discusses the right of primogeniture, investing 
the subject in ' an atmosphere of gloom and 
melodrama/ Herr Fulda's new play takes us 
back to the world of the Eenaissance, and dis- 
cusses, by means of the first lady doctor of law 
of Bologna, the question of woman's emancipa- 
tion. *Der Meister,' by Herr Hermann Bahr, 
has adultery for its theme, and for its hero a 
complacent piece of self-portraiture. Finally, 
the new comedy of Herr Sudermann, entitled 
' Der Sturmgeselle Sokrates,' presents the lib- 
eral revolutionary feeling of 1848 as it survives 
in this later generation, and the inevitable con- 
flict which it entails between fathers and sons. 
The play is described as both tedious and unsuc- 
cesful. The following comment upon the pres- 
ent condition of the stage is highly significant: 

' If the real merit of the revolt in the early 
nineties consisted mainly in the fact that the stage 
was once more opened to works of serious literature 
which made no concessions to popular taste, and 
that it brought all superficial and sensational meth- 
ods into disrepute, assuredly some of the whilom 
leaders in that struggle have long since returned 
to a calculated and unscrupulous stagecraft. They 
worship to-day the idols that they burnt ten years 
ago. ' 

The greatest fictional success of the year is 
reported to have been achieved by the anony- 
mous ' Briefe, Die Ihn nicht Erreichten,' which 
has already appeared in English. Herr Wil- 
helm Hegeler's ' Pastor Klingshammer ' is a 
study of character, having for its main theme 
a quarrel between two brothers, one of whom 
eventually kills the other. Frau Eiearda 
• Huch's ' Von den Konigen und der Krone ' is 
a romantic novel with an atmosphere of fairy 
tale, Herr Peter Eosseger's ' Das Siinderglockl ' 
is a novel that ' preaches the gospel of repent- 
ance, and inveighs against fashionable vice and 
immorality.' Herr von Keyserling's ^Beate 
und Mareile ' is based upon a marriage prob- 
lem. 'A count forsakes his quiet, fair-haired 
wife for a woman of ardent, impulsive tempera- 
ment, but finally grows weary, longs for rest, 
and returns again to her arms.' Four volumes 
of new poetry are the posthumous ' Erntezeit ' 
of Wilhelm von Polenz, in whose pages ' manly 
sincerit}'^ and mature philosophy are everywhere 
in evidence ' ; ' Peregrinas Sommerabende,' by 
Frau Irene Forbes-Mosse, inspired by the 
romantic renaissance; 'Die Singende Siinde,' 
by Herr Georg Busse-Palma, a book 'full of 
passion,' which 'over and over again sings of 
glowing kisses in country lane or arbour'; and 
'Die Lockende Geige,' by Herr Hans Miiller, 
' a delicate and intimate piece of work.' Out- 
side of the range of belletristic literature. Dr. 
Heilbom has almost nothing to report, but 
rather because his space is already filled than 
^rom a lack of material about which to write.

Memoirs of ax English Scholar.* 

Eeaders of Edward FitzGerald will need no 
formal introduction to Professor Edward 
Byles C'owell, the distinguished Sanskritist of 
Cambridge University, whose death a year and 
a half ago was a decided loss to the learned 
world. How pleasantly we now recall those 
Persian and Spanish readings, a deux, at one 
time at Woodbridge, and again at Cambridge I 
With what ease and grace could the great 
scholar and linguist illuminate, from the 
resources of comparative philology and a range 
of reading tbat seemed literally boundless, 
even the most commonplace as well as the most 
puzzling passages in his old friend's favorite 
' Don ' ! As characteristic of the bom teacher 
and linguist, take this one sentence from his 
early letters to his betrothed, fourteen years 
and more his senior, to whom he was giving 
Sanskrit lessons by mail, — ' Eemember, we 
have a real difficulty, a crowning one ( real in 
Spanish means " royal " ) ( ought I not to be 
more serious, more like a grave pedant in thus 
coming to this terrible point ? ) ' He was then 
not yet twenty years old, his lady love thirty- 
four. No wonder his schoolmates at first 
thought he had succumbed to an unwarranted 
attack on his liberty; but all prejudice was 
straightway overcome as soon as they made the 
acquaintance of Elizabeth Charlesworth, whose 
bright intelligence and high ideals made her 
universally admired, and whose warm sympathy 
with all her young husband's aspirations and 
cordial interest in his friends could not but win 
the latter's hearty liking. That she exerted no 
little influence in shaping Cowell's career and 
in bringing him the honors that crowned his . 
later years, becomes very apparent in reading 
his biography. 

The discouragements Cowell had to contend 
against in youth were not light. His father, 
an Ipswich merchant, died when Edward was 
only sixteen, making it necessary for him, as 
the eldest of the six children, to leave school 
and assume control of the business. Eight 
years of bondage to ' the desk's dead wood ' 
followed, until the next brother was able to 
mount the office stool and relieve him. Yet 
with an uncomplaining industry that would 
have put Charles Lamb to the blush, he accom- 
plished in that time a really prodigious amount 
of reading and study and writing; so that 
when, at the age of twenty-four, he yielded to 
the urgent solicitations of his wife and of his

friend Kitchin, and presented himself for 
matriculation at Oxford, he must have pos- 
sessed ' a stock of erudition that might have 
puzzled a doctor/ but without the correspond- 
ing ' degree of ignorance of which a schoolboy 
might have been ashamed/ The fact alone that 
he had, almost unassisted, gained a good knowl- 
edge of Sanskrit, will attest his extraordinary 
power of application. To enumerate the other 
languages, ancient and modern, that he had 
also mastered, in a literary way, would require 
too much space ; and the books in those tongues 
which he had not only read but critically stud- 
ied, as evidenced by his early magazine articles 
and reviews, are fairly bewildering in their 
range and number. His biographer has good 
reason to call him a ' gourmand ' in reading ; 
hut, what the gourmand too often fails to do, 
he digested and assimilated all that he read, 
showing powers of memory and quickness of 
insight that are truly remarkable. 

The remaining principal events in his life 
may here be briefly given, after which a few 
quotations, chiefly from his letters, will serve 
to illustrate what manner of man he was. His 
biographer, Mr. Greorge Cowell, is his cousiin. 
and writes with all the sympathy and apprecia- 
tion of an admiring kinsman. It was in the 
summer of 1856, as he tells us, that Cowell, at 
the age of thirty, sailed with his wife for India 
to assume the professorship of English history 
and political economy at the Presidency Col- 
lege, Calcutta. There he remained seven and 
a half years, teaching not only his assigned 
subjects, but also various other branches as 
need arose, and, after a few years, undertaking 
in addition the principalship of the Sanskrit 
College and infusing new life into that school. 
Reading and writing meanwhile went on unin- 
terruptedly, and soon it was found that he 
could give points in Sanskrit even to the 
Pundits, although of course as specialists in 
separate branches) of Sanskrit lore they were 
his superiors. The inevitable effect of climate 
compelled his return to England before he had 
intended; and three years later came his tri- 
umphant election to the newly established Cam- 
bridge professorship of Sanskrit which he held 
until his death in 1903. 

Going back now to that remarkable series of 
letters — one can hardly call them love let- 
ters — which he wrote to Miss Charlesworth, 
we chance on a characteristic bit in connection 
with the pronunciation of the Sanskrit labials. 
' It reminds me of years and years ago, when I 
was a little boy at school, and when I used to be 
very naughty and talk in school hours, and I found 
out that the master could never see me talking 
unless when I pronounced these very labial letters, 
and therefore I used to avoid them in conversa- 
tion to my neighbors, lest my lips should move 
and betray me.' 



A later letter to his friend Kitchin — the 
present Dean of Durham, it will be understood* 
— gives a pleasing glimpse of the young schol- 
ar" s hopes and aspirations. 

' I have the pleasure to tell' you that that paper 
on " Homer and Firdusi " which I wrote while 
you were staying with me was published in the 
Gentlemen'' s Magazine this month, and this morn- 
ing I received a postoffice order for it. ... I 
am going everv now and then to send them papers 
about Oriental subjects. This will give an addi- 

tional vigor to my Oriental studies, and I hope to 
?ush them on with some hopes of success. When 
know Sanscrit, which, you know, is a field that 
has not been made commonplace or trite, I hope to 
bring my acquaintance with Greek and Latin and 
Persian to bear upon that as a focus, and I hope 
to trace out the influence of the Oreek mind upon 
the Hindu mind through Alexander's conquests and 
colonies. There is great connection between the 
two languages, and I expect there is equally a 
connection between the habits of thought and the 
ideas themselves of the two nations.' 

Here the ardent scholar is fax more in evi- 
dence than the practised writer, as the reader 
will have noted. The part of CowelFs life that 
seems to have given him most pleasure in the 
living, and most satisfaction in the retrospect, 
was his term of service in India. As the cli- 
mate made sedentary pursuits a necessity, he- 
adapted himself to conditions and accomplishedif 
an enormous amount of reading, editing, and' 
writing, besides his teaching. The compara- 
tive coolness of the early morning he devotedl 
to literary occupation. At half-past five we 
see him seated on his board verandah, where he 
read and wrote for three hours before brealring 
his fast. Indeed, many a time he was too 
deeply engrossed to note the coming of his 
morning cutlet, and one of the crows that 
abound in Calcutta would often swoop down 
and carry off his breakfast. From a letter home 
we take the following: 

' We were amused at one part of your last let- 
ter, which mentioned Indian luxuries, and when 
you expressed some fear as to how we should rel- 
ish plain English fare after the delicacies of the 
tropics. The fact is India has no luxuries or deli- 
cacies, — the finest Indian things are inferior to 
third rate things in England. There is nothing 
good in India which is not very inferior and five 
times, ten times dearer than the corresponding 
thing in England. We live almost entirely on legs 
of mutton, chickens, ducks and eggs; and none of 
them is to be compared in size or flavor with those 
in England. I never touch any of the preserves. 
Guava is the best and it is very beautiful to look 
at, but I can't bear its excessive sweetness. Then 
all the fruit (as I read in Hooker's Himalayas 
before I came out ) is very insipid and poor; and 
it is not very wholesome either. I generally keep 
to plantains, which are like a very poor pear, 
grafted on a potato. The only luxury in India is 
the Pundit, and that you can't get in England. 1 
always say that to those who don't care about the 
languages and the people, residence in India must 
be very disagreeable.'

Cowell's extreme modesty will be surprised that 
he protested against the publication of Edward 
FitzGerald's encomiums in the ' Letters ' edited 
by Mr. W. Aldis Wright. He declared that he 
was not learned' in the Cambridge sense, 
although he was forced to admit that he had 
read widely. Akin to this insistence on a mod- 
est estimate of himself was his conscientious- 
ness in even the smallest particulars. A niece 
of Mrs. Cowell gives this illustration: 

' An instance occurs to me in connection with his 
correspondence with one of the old Indian Pundits 
with whom he had studied in India. I noticed that 
in despatching a letter to him he had a special 
method of moistening the envelope from a saucer 
of water. On my asking the reason, he explained 
that a Brahman would consider it defilement to 
touch an envelope that had been moistened with 
the tongue. " But would he feel safe," I asked, 
" in your case from the possibility of your doing 
things in the usual way? " The reply was, " He 
has my word for it." ' 

That Cowell's name is to-day almost 
unknown to the great reading public is less to 
be wondered at when we remember that literary 
aspirations soon became secondary with him. 
It was in keeping with the unaffected piety of 
Ms nature that he grew to be more interested 
in his occupation of enlightening young minds, 
in taking part in missionary work, and in mak- 
ing himself, as he expressed it, ' an instrument 
rmder God for doing some good.' Thus it is 
that we find more to charm in one letter of that 
delightful old pagan FitzGerald than in all his 
erudite friend's scholarly writings. A number 
of these letters are now first published, and are 
welcome additions to the volume, although they 
contain nothing of extraordinary interest. 
What the two correspondents and devoted 
friends had pre-eminently in common was the 
quality of self-effacement. Each proved his 
greatness by never knowing that he excelled. 

The editor's task has been no light one, and 
it has been very satisfactorily executed. Such 
minor errors as the book contains are too few 
and too unimportant to call for individual men- 
tion. Two good portraits of Cowell add 
greatly to the value of the work, and the reader 
only regrets that Mrs. Cowell's likeness is not 
also given, as she was no less remarkable in 
her way than he in his.

Perhaps the most interesting special number yet 
issued by ' The International Studio ' (John Lane) 
is the one devoted to ' The Royal Academy, from 
Reynolds to Millais,' recently published. A half- 
dozen articles by various writers, numerous fac- 
isimile letters, and a profusion of fine illustrations 
in photogravure, color, and half-tone, serve to 
present a most illuminating record of each section 
of the Academy from its inception to the year 
1868. Mr. Charles Holme is the editor of the vol- 



The Cult of Matthe^v Arnold.* 



If Matthew Arnold had foreseen the way in 
which his wish to be known to posterity 
through his writings, and not through biogra- 
phies, would affect his future reputation, he 
might easily have avoided all the fighting to 
which his disciples are now forced in his 
defense. Few writers have been so beloved and 
appreciated by the literary men of their own 
time. Their regard was a continual source of 
wonder, even to him. ' Swinburne fairly took 
my breath away,' he writes. ' I must say the 
general public praise me in the dubious style 
in which old Wordsworth used to praise Ber- 
nard Barton, James Montgomery, and such- 
like; and the writers of poetry, on the other 
hand, — Browning, Swinburne, Lytton, — 
praise me as the general public praises its 
favorites. This is a curious reversal of the 
usual order of things.' Under such circum- 
stances, it was only his expressed desire to the 
contrary which kept his friends among the 
large-souled men who were able to appreciate 
him from using their pens to write his 
praises. 

Some of his lefters, with most of his loving 
good-nature and brilliant raillery 'blue pen- 
cilled ' as too personal, were published in 1895, 
and with them the storm broke. All the little 
men of letters, the whole tribe of Pennyalinus, 
were upon Mm in full force, scoffing at his 
poetry, arguing against his politics, shouting 
and screaming against his theology. Until a 
year or two ago, however, their work was val- 
ued at its just worth, and might have remained 
unnoticed had not so well-known a critic as 
Mr. Herbert W. Paul departed from his usual 
just and temperate tone and written a 
biography of Arnold which is not a criticism 
but a censorship ; which quotes every poor line 
the poet ever wrote, and barely notes his best 
work ; which is calculated to produce an impres- 
sion of its subject paralleled only by Mark 
Antony's oration, and leaves the reader thank- 
ful that it is Arnold and not Browning who is 
being judged by his poorest work. Immedi- 
ately Arnold's admirers felt themselves bound 
to take up the cudgel in his behalf ; but their 
best efforts are weakened by the fact that their 
position is one of defense, and must remain so 
for some time to come. To do Matthew Arnold 
justice it will require that some one who is 
not an Englishman, some one whose perspective 
is large enough to include th e universal appli-

cation of Arnold's philosophy, should see his 
religion apart from his theology and its rela- 
tion to establishment and nonconformity, to 
decide disinterestedly whether his liberalism 
was conservative or radical, and above all to 
enjoy his humor without feeling the thrusts 
from his penetrating shafts. 

As far as it is possible for Englishmen to 
rate him correctly, however, it has been done 
by Mr. William Harbutt Dawson in his ' Mat- 
thew Arnold and his Relation to the Thought 
of Our Time,' and by Mr. G. W. E. Russell in 
his life of Arnold recently published in Scrib- 
ner's series of ' Literary Lives.' Neither book 
is a biography, in the full sense of being a his- 
tory, an estimate, and an analysis. Mr. Rus- 
sell's book, which is a survey of the effect that 
Arnold produced by his writings and a study 
of his method, serves as a good supplement to 
Mr. Dawson's statement of Arnold's philoso- 
phy, which he prefaces as follows: 

' There is to-day a cult of Matthew Arnold; it 
is growing; it must grow. It will grow because 
many tendencies of the age are in its favor; still 
more because many influences are opposed to it, and 
because the healthiest instincts of human nature 
and the deepest interests of civilization require 
that it shall combat these opposing influences and 
overcome them. The cult of Matthew Arnold is the 
cult of idealism, using the word not, of course, in 
its philosophical sense, but as indicating the pur- 
suit of perfection as the worthiest working prin- 
ciple of life.' 

It is this pursuit of universal perfection that 
Arnold stands for most definitely. It is the 
preaching of this doctrine that led the prac- 
tical men of his age to call him unscientific, a 
dreamer, unaware of the great strong current 
of individualism which controlled English life. 
And so slowly have the forces of civilization 
worked that even to-day, when all economists 
admit the natural evolution from ' involuntary 
social cooperation to voluntary social coopera- 
tion,' when the laissez-faire theory is as dead 
as the men who fostered it, the mass of men 
will not see that Arnold was right when he 
claimed that it was not progress, but lack of 
progress, which dictated the worship of mate- 
rial advancement. 'Your middle class man 
thinks it the highest pitch of development and 
civilization when his letters are carried twelve 
times a day from Islington to Camberwell, and 
from Camberwell to Islington, and if railway 
trains run to and fro between them every quar- 
ter of an hour. He thinks it is nothing that 
trains only carry him from an illiberal, dismal 
life at Islington to an illiberal, dismal life at 
Camberwell ; and the letters only tell him that 
such is the life there.' 

If Matthew Arnold was sometimes unjust to 
the men of science, if, in his devotion to his 
cause and his love for the 'grand old fortify- 



ing classical curriculum,' he was inclined to 
give undue prominence to the humanities in 
the scheme of education, — it was not because 
he was narrow-minded, but because he saw 
clearly that while beauty and truth and color 
were without, away from the self of a man, 
happiness and love and understanding and 
culture must come from within. The men of 
science had become so accustomed to the micro- 
scope and the magnifying glass that they had 
lost the use of their inner eyes; and this to 
Arnold was not only weakness, but wickedness. 
' The only absolute good, the only absolute and 
eternal object prescribed to us by God's law, or 
the divine order of things, is the progress towards 
perfection, — our own progress toward it and the 
progress of humanity. Culture has one great pas- 
sion, the passion for sweetness and light. It has 
one even greater! — the passion for making them 
PEEVAIL. It is not satisfied till we ALL come to 
a perfect man; it knows that the sweetness and 
light of the few must be imperfect until the raw 
and unkindled masses of humanity are touched 
with sweetness and light. So all our fellow-men, 
in the East of London and elsewhere, we must take 
along with us in the progress toward perfection, if 
we ourselves really, as we profess, want to be per- 
fect; and we must not let the worship of any 
fetish, any machinery, such as manufactures or 
population, — which are not, like perfection, abso- 
lute goods in themselves, though we think them 
so, — create for us such a multitude of miserable, 
sunken, and ignorant human beings, that to carry 
them along is impossible, and perforce they must 
for the most part be left by us in their degreda- 
tion and wretchedness.' 

Besides being a splendid piece of writing, 
and in thought a whole generation in advance 
of its time, that is practical social economy. 
So is all of ' Culture and Anarchy,' and in a 
totally different vein so is that characteris- 
tically brilliant and satirical series called 
' Friendship's Garland.' Neither these nor the 
other of Arnold's social or educational writ- 
ings are open to the criticism of lacking abso- 
lute present value, of being without the vital 
principle to work from, which attaches to his 
religious system. Of the fault in the latter, 
Mr. Dawson speaks the last word, after having 
wasted a great deal of time in discussing minor 
matters of purely theological import. 

* As an ethical system, it is in theory admirable; 
but its positive value is in the highest degree ques- 
tionable. Pascal's judgment upon the God who 
emerged from the philosophical investigations of 
R6n6 Descartes was that He was a God who was 
unnecessary. And one may with even greater truth 
say that the man who is able to receive and live 
by the religion which Arnold offers him is no longer 
in need of its help and stimulus. To be able to 
appreciate an ethical idealism, a man must be 
already an ethical idealist. Only by a serious intel- 
lectual effort can it be apprehended, only by rigor- 
ous mental discipline can it be appropriated. It 
follows, however, that the one who has succeeded 
in apprehending and appropriating it needs the 
inspiration no longer; while support and consola- 
tion it is impotent to give. The religion that 



202 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



aspires to be universal must meet universal needs; 
the religion that would be a religion of mankind 
must be capable of taking man at his lowest and 
worst and lifting him into the high places of virtue, 
of moral and spiritual worth. But just because, 
like all ethical systems, Arnold's religion presup- 
poses a very high degree both of intellectuality and 
of rectitude, it, with them, is foredoomed to fail- 
ure as a universal regenerating force. It will fail 
because it possesses no initial power of edification; 
it may preserve, but it cannot build up.' 

Whether Arnold's political writings belong in 
the class of practical suggestion of reform, or 
with ^ his religion in that of idealistic theories, 
we are still too close to decide absolutely; but 
the tendency of belief is toward the former. In 
either case, his criticisms of political methods 
and aims are eminently just and wise. In 
fact, it is always as a critic that Arnold excels. 
He was not naturally a man of action, and his 
dislike of the exaggerated material strenuous- 
ness of the age drove him almost to the other 
extreme. He rendered invaluable service to 
the cause of education during his term as 
inspector, but even here it is rather through 
his luminous reports and their critical advice 
than through any active work in politics; his 
active association with any party would prob- 
ably have been less effective than his persistent 
pounding away at the evils of the present Eng- 
lish class-system which has resulted in making 
'the upper class materialized, the middle class 
vulgarized, the lower class brutalized.' The 
very epigrams for which he is famous, and 
which many critics hold to be a weakness rather 
than a strength from the purely literary stand- 
point, have been a political and social force, 
through their art of reproducing perfectly the 
idea for which they stand. The power of 

* sweetness and light,' the contrast between 

* Hellenism and Hebraism,' the necessity for 

* Vigour and rigour,' the varying dangers to 
society from ' the Barbarians, the Philistines, 
and the Populace,' — he has familiarized us 
with, them all, and familiarity with an idea is 
the first step towards embodying it in every- 
day practice. 

Again, it is as la critic of life that Matthew 
Arnold has acquired his rank , among the poets. 
That he possessed poetical powers of the first 
order, no one may well doubt who knows the 
beautiful lines from Dover Beach : 

' The sea of faith 

Was once, too, at the full, and round earth's shore 

Lay like the folds of a bright girdle furl'd. 

But now I only, hear 

Its melancholy, long, withdrawing roar. 

Retreating, to the breath 

Of the night-wind, down the vast edges drear 

And naked shingles of the world. 

' Ah, love, let us be true 

To one another ! for the world, which seems 

To lie before us like a land of dreams. 

So various, so beautiful, so new. 

Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light. 



Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain ; 
And we are here as on a darkling plain 
Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight. 
Where ignorant armies clash by night. ' 

Arnold's power is, however, not unqualified, 
and Mr, Eussell seems to have estimated him 
exactly when he writes : 

' He had the poet's heart and mind, but they 
did not readily express themselves in the poetic 
medium. He longed for poetic utterance as his 
only adequate vent, and sought it earnestly with 
tears. Often he achieved it, but not seldom he left 
the impression of frustrated and disappointing 
effort, rather than of easy mastery and sure attain- 
ment. Again, if we bear in mind Milton's three- 
fold canon, we must admit that his poetry lacks 
three great elements of power. He is not simple, 
sensuous, or passionate. He is too essentially mod- 
ern to be really simple. He is the product of a 
high-strung civilization, and all its complicated 
cross-currents of thought and feeling stir and per- 
plex his verse. He is not sensuous except in so far 
as the most refined and delicate appreciation of 
nature in all her forms can be said to constitute a 
sensuous enjoyment. And then, again, he is pre- 
eminently not passionate. He is calm, balanced, 
self-controlled, sane, austere. The very qualities 
which are his characteristic glory make passion 
impossible. Another hindrance to his title as a 
great poet is that he is not, and could never be, a 
poet of the multitude. His verse lacks all popular 
fibre. It is the delight of scholars, of philosophers, 
of men who live by silent introspection or quiet 
communing with nature. But it is altogether 
remote from the stir and stress of popular life and 
struggle. Then, again, his tone is profoundly, 
though not morbidly, melancholy, and this is fatal 
to popularity. In brief, it seems to me that he was 
not a great poet, for he lacked the gifts which 
sway the multitude and compel the attention of 
mankind. But he was a true poet, rich in those 
qualities which make the loved and trusted teacher 
of a chosen few — as he himself would have said, 
of the " Eemnant." ' 

If the critics are right, — if, as Mr. Paul 
says, Matthew Arnold was not a profound 
thinlcer; or, as Mr. Dawson says, he was not 
a great politician or theologian; or, as Mr. 
Eussell says, he was not a great , poet, — in 
what, then, was he great enough to establish 
and maintain a cult? The question is easily 
answered: He was, first of all, the great 'apos- 
tle and exponent of culture; he was the man 
above all men in his generation who knew the 
best that had been said and thought in all ages, 
who ' saw life steadily and saw it whole.' And 
through this, he was great as a critic and a 
man of letters. Even Mr. Paul concedes this, 

' Matthew Arnold's literary criticism, once 
regarded by young enthusiasts as a revelation, has 
long since taken a secure place in English letters. 
It is penetrating as well as brilliant, conscientious 
as well as imaginative. Matthew Arnold may be 
said to have done for literature what Euskin did 
for art. He reminded, or informed, the British 
public that criticism was a serious thing; that good 
criticism was just as important as good author- 
ship; that it was not a question of individual 
taste, but partly of received authority, partly of 
trained judgment. Few critics have been so thor-

oughly original, and still fewer have had so large 
a share of the " daemonic " faculty, the faculty 
which awakens intelligent enthusiasm in others. 
Essays in Criticism is one of the indispensable 
books. Not to have read it is to be ignorant of a 
great intellectual event.' 

Mr. Dawson writes of Arnold as one who 
has carefully and earnestly studied his subject, 
Mr. Eussell adds to his less pretentious volume 
the charm of personal association; and both 
men have contributed something definite and 
valuable to the cause they champion. And yet, 
having read the opinion of all the critics on 
all the various phases of Arnold's nature and 
endeavor, there comes a desire to paraphrase 
the warning of the Baptist minister w'ho 
advised his congregation to spend two hours 
reading the Bible for every hour spent in read- 
ing Arnold, and to advise the reading public 
to spend two hours in reading Arnold for every 
half-hour spent in reading about Arnold.

The Seaboard Slave States.* 

In two large well-printed volumes, Messrs. 
G. P. Putnam's Sons have reissued what is 
probably the best known of the books of travel 
in the South during the slavery regime — Olm- 
sted's ' Seaboard Slave States.' Frederick Law 
Olmsted was a thorough-going abolitionist of 
the more sensible type, bom and reared in New 
England, and devoted to New England ideals. 
Until he finally discovered his talent as a land- 
scape gardener, when he was about forty years 
old, Olmsted had had an easy, amateurish, and, 
from a worldly point of view, an unsuccessful 
life. He studied engineering, then he travelled, 
then worked in a dry-goods store, but, not liking 
that, pursued studies in Yale; next he tried a 
sailor's life, after which farming claimed his 
attention for a year or two; he travelled in 
England, and later in the Southern States as 
newspaper correspondent, and next he became 
an editor and publisher. During the Civil War 
he was one of the chief promoters of the Union 
League movement in the North, which finally 
organized the Negro-Republican party of the 
South. 

The work under review was first published 
in 1856, and was a revision of a series of let- 
ters written to the New York ' Times ' during 
the winter and spring of 1852-3 ( not in 1853- 
4, as the title states ) when Olmsted was on a 
three months' tour through the South. It 
comprises a description of the internal economy,

Years 1853-1854. With Remarks on their Economy. By 
Frederick Law Olmsted. (Originally issued in 1856.)

and an Introduction by William P. Trent. In two vol- 
umes. New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons. 



as Olmsted saw it, of Virginia, the Carolinas, 
Georgia, Alabama., and Louisiana, together 
with the author's views on slavery. Southern 
society, Southern politics, and the economic his- 
tory of the slave states. The author in his 
travels neglected the great plantation states — 
South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, — 
passing rapidly through them; in Louisiana he 
stopped a little longer; Mississippi he did not 
enter; in Virginia and Norih Carolina he saw 
more of Southern institutions. 

It was Olmsted's peculiar stock of theori^ 
and prejudices that made and still makes his 
book such interesting reading. A hater of 
slavery, he had no great love for the negro. 
He believed that the white people, in all the 
relations of life, were injured by slavery, and 
he was of the opinion that the economic rather 
than the moral side of slavery was the ruinous 
one. In his view, all the ills of the South 
might be traced to the bad economic conditions 
produced by slavery. At the same time it is 
evident that Olmsted, before going South, had 
been fascinated by what he had heard of the 
patriarchal institution. Southern luxury, 
Southern social life, and Southern hospitality. 
He had formed an idea of a wicked and uneco- 
nomic but pleasant and brilliant civilization; 
and his disgust at what he found is amusing. 

Concerning the matter of hospitality, for 
instance. Olmsted came South with the idea 
that the Southern people generally were accus- 
tomed to forcing hospitality upon the passing 
stranger of whatever degree, and he was greatly 
surprised to find that he had to pay his way 
just as in other sections of the country. The 
phrase ' Southern hospitality ' finally came to 
anger him; he made it a point to inveigh 
against the tradition every time he made a 
note in his diary of paying a bill at one of the 
abominable Southern bostelries. The class of 
people with whom he stayed may be judged 
from the fact that he usually had, as he 
asserted, only one sheet on his bed and that 
one filthy. Olmsted had a few letters of intro- 
duction to planters, and it was mainly because 
of these that he said a few pleasant words 
about Southern things and people. We won- 
der what kind of a book he would have written 
had he brought numerous letters ! He was also 
worried by the aristocratic pretensions of the 
Southerners, especially of the Virginians; and 
he declared that most of their ancestors had 
been bought and sold as servants and laborers. 
Of the ability of Southern men in law and 
politics, he was very doubtful; and many are 
the scornful words he writes concerning them. 
Governor Wise of Virginia, for instance, was 
characterized as a 'gasconading mountebank.' 
South Carolina statesmen were, he thought, of 
an especially low order. In general he was

quite skeptical concerning Southern ability. In 
a place like Charleston, he admitted, people 
fitted to go to a dinner-party might be easily 
found ; but he maintains that the great major- 
ity of the slave-holders were coarse and illit- 
erate, and lower-lived than the common 
laborers of the North. And in his opinion the 
poor whites, especially those in the Black Belt, 
were as low as the negroes. The South Caro- 
linians were in general 'a. decayed and stulti- 
fied people,' and the women of the non-slave- 
holding class, — a class which numbered about 
three hundred thousand in South Carolina, — 
were, he intimates, distinguished by a lack of 
chastity. It was mainly from Olmsted's 
descriptions that Caimes, the Irish economist, 
formed his well-known theories of Southern 
society with its five million white vagabonds 
wandering over vast and dreary wastes. 

The most valuable of Olmsted's observations 
were in regard to the institution of slavery. He 
tells us what he saw of the work, dress, food, 
morals, homes, and family life of the negroes, 
of the prices of slaves and the wages of 
negroes and whites. He knew nothing of the 
history of the negro, and took it for granted 
that American slavery was degrading the negro 
race, not uplifting it in any way. Believing 
that strict discipline was degrading to anyone, 
he was of the opinion that the stringent regu- 
lation of slavery was hurtful to the character 
of the slave, and he undertook to prove it by 
asserting that the discipline in the American 
Navy had bad. effects on the character of the 
white sailors. Notwithstanding the fact that 
he was disgusted with the stupid negro slaves, 
Olmsted sometimes insisted on crediting the 
blacks with white sensibilities, though usually 
they are described as but little above the 
brutes. In one place he declares that cruelty 
and driving are necessary to make slavery pay ; 
in another place, a planter is commended for 
using a system of tasks and rewards to secure 
willing labor, and this example is cited as the 
proper way to make slaves work. When deny- 
ing that the slave was as well fed as the North- 
ern laborer, he intimates that the negro was 
often not well fed; later we are told that he 
had plenty of food. The necessity of cruelty 
to make the slave work is constantly empha- 
sized, as well as the increasing degradation of 
the slaves; but in an unguarded moment the 
admission is made that in the border states the 
condition of slaves had been bettered during 
the last generation, — a^ fact also shown by 
his numerous quotations from Southern author- 
ities, which are not commented upon by him. In 
both North and South, the free negro was out 
of place, and his condition no better than that 
of the slave; and freed negroes sent North 
often returned. The descriptions of slavery, 



when the traveller really came in contact with 
it, form what would be a not unpleasant pic- 
ture if looked at through the eyes of anyone 
but a hostile critic who paid slight attention to 
the ameliorations of the institution. If the 
negro were inferior to the white, then he must 
have been doing fairly well in the life that 
Olmsted describes, — wages for extra work, the 
privileges of having poultry, pigs, gardens, fine 
attire for Sunday, and slight punishment. 
Many things picturesque and pleasant to the 
sight of others were harrowing to our traveller 
from the North. 

It was in its economic aspect that the worst 
evils of slavery were touched upon; and hen 
Olmsted could satisfy himself more by stating 
facts, and less by expressions of opinion. Reliar 
ble statistics make clear the burden upon the 
planter caused by the necessity of investing 
most of his capital in labor; but the effect upon 
the price of slaves of pro-slavery sentiment 
caused by anti-slavery agitation was not men- 
tioned. The tendency of slavery to drive the 
poorer whites to the less fertile lands and to 
the frontiers was seen but not fully understood 
by the Northern farmer, who felt that slavery 
was a great evil to the whites, but was unable 
to interpret the facts he collected. He did not 
see what forty years of freedom have shown, 
that it was tlie negro, not slavery, that injured 
the economic system of the South ; slavery only 
made the negro a more powerful instrument of 
evil to the poor whites. Released from the 
restraints of slavery, the negro no longer so 
seriously competes with the white laborer, 
because free negro labor is not as efficient as 
slave labor was. Slave labor was very costly 
labor, and Olmsted's comparisons on this point 
were instructive: wages for common laborers 
were twenty-five per cent higher in the South 
than in the North; the hire of a negro was 
more than that of a wliite man on the same 
plantation ; to protect the valuable negro slaves 
from injury, Irish laborers were often imported 
to do heavy and dangerous work; it was next 
to impossible to keep the negro from shamming 
illness in order to escape work; the slave, on 
account of his clumsiness, could not be tri^ted 
-^vith improved farm implements, and often had 
no interest in doing his work well. All this, 
and much more, Olmsted criticises justly; but 
in his eagerness to denounce slavery, he reaxjhes 
the incredible. For instance, he claims that in 
Virginia the cost of slave labor was three hun- 
dred to four hundred per cent higher than the 
cost of free labor in New York, which was 
probably about correct. But he then proceeds 
to quote statistics to show that a negro in Vir- 
ginia would gather in a day one-eighteenth to 
one-twenty-fourth as much wheat from one- 
eighth as much land as a laborer in New York.

Surely slavery was hardly so bad as that ! He 
cited, as a fact to prove the worthlessness of 
slave labor, that the negroes would stop work to 
look at the passing trains! 

That there was a strong anti-slavery feeling 
all over the South was clearly proved by Olm- 
sted's investigations. He was interested by 
this sentiment, but ascribed little importance 
to it. There were numbers of people who wished 
to have slavery abolished, provided the negro 
couldj be gotten rid of. The facts quoted do 
not agree with the theory of the blind devotion 
of the South to slavery. Olmsted showed that 
slavery could not exist in the territories of the 
Northwest, yet pretended to fear slavery expan- 
sion in that direction. This was simply a reflec- 
tion of the anti-slavery agitation of the time. 

This Northern traveller was an easy mark for 
the spinners of yarns. Many wonderful tales 
went down into his voluminous note-books. 
Even the negroes guyed him, but he was per- 
fectly serious always. He did not see the point 
of a joke while in the South. Many important 
things were overlooked : the development of the 
lower South after 1820, with interests some- 
what distinct from those of the upper South; 
the rapid rise of manufacturers in the white 
districts; the changes being wrought in econo- 
mic conditions, especially in the border states, 
by the introduction of improved machinery and 
by railroads, and above all by losing competi- 
tion with the free states; the difference between 
the economics of the frontier and the economics 
of slavery; the fact that the slave was the rural 
mechanic of the South ; — all this escaped him 
entirely. 

On the whole, the work is of great value to 
the student of economic history. There is much 
in it that is useless, and the useless is hard to 
separate from the good; but what Olmsted 
really saw and heard is the valuable part. His 
facts are of value, but he was not always able 
to interpret them, being hampered by his 
strong prejudices against slavery and all that 
pertained to it. His opinions and theories. 
Which might or might not have been true, are 
of no value except as a moderate statement of 
the abolitionist argument. His numerous quo- 
tations are all to support his thesis; there is 
no other side. He quotes Defoe's ' Moll Flan- 
ders ' as an authority on early Virginia history. 
To the Black Belt, emancipation has brought 
none of the good predicted; but it has brought 
good to the white districts. At times, Olmsted 
seemed to feel that this would be the case, 
though he felt bound to say that the free 
negro would be a better worker and better man 
than the slave. 

As a specimen of bookmaking, the new edi- 
tion is far superior to the old, although the 



illustrations are unfortunately omitted. The 
biographical sketch, by the author's son, gives 
only the main facts of his life. The fourteen- 
page Introduction, by Professor Trent, adds 
nothing to the value of the work. Professor 
Trent says that Mr. John Morley, Mr. Rhodes, 
and Mr. Lowell, none of whom ever saw a slave 
plantation, thought that the 'Seaboard Slave 
States ' was an authority, and therefore it must 
be so, he reasons. He further calls attention to 
the fact that Olmsted saw only the unpleasant 
aspects of slavery, and that he was imposed 
upon by Texas story-tellers.

Purchase.* 



Not the least important of the fruits of 
the Louisiana Purchase centenary is the extraor- 
dinary impetus it has given to historical 
research .bearing upon that vitally important 
period in the expansion of the United States 
which is now being so widely commemorated. 
It is of course nothing unusual for the centen- 
ary of a great historical event to be marked by 
the publication of books and pamphlets and 
magazine articles, to meet the increased public 
interest stimulated by the commemorative cele- 
brations; but it is by no means usual to find 
either the public interest so thoroughly aroused, 
or the historical literature so extensive and 
important, as in the present case. 

It may be that this, condition is largely due 
to the fact that the people of the United States 
have never really lost interest in that most pic- 
turesque and far-sighted bit of statecraft, the 
purchase of Louisiana from Napoleon. The 
acquisition of what was in Jefferson's day for 
the most part an unknown wilderness, tenanted 
only by wild tribes, seemed to many of his con- 
temporaries a piece of extravagant madness; 
yet, in the light of subsequent events the sum 
paid was absolutely paltry, for the United 
States thus gained possession of an enormous 
territory, holding the potentialities of unlim- 
ited wealth and, what to citizens of the United 
States must be much more important, the seeds 
of national greatness. The gradual apprecia- 
tion of the magnitude of the heritage thus 
bequeathed to the American people accounts 
for the fact that for a hundred years they 
have never really forgotten the Louisiana Pur- 
chase, and it needed no artificial stimulus to

arouse their interest in the wealth of historical 
material that has grown up around the subject 
during the past year or two. 

One need not go to St. Louis to find out 
that the Louisiana Purchase is very much in 
the public eye. It is hardly possible to glance 
through the lists of any of the leading Ameri- 
can publishers without meeting something new 
upon the subject. It may be a history of the 
period from some fresh point of view; a biog- 
raphy of one of the men who made the Louisi- 
ana Purchase possible, or explored the vast ter- 
ritory thus acquired; a novel with this period 
and this boundless frontier as its setting; a 
carefully annotated edition of one of the early 
journals that are part of the original records; 
or perhaps merely a reprint of one of these 
journals; or, finally, the publication for the 
first time of some important historical manu- 
script that has lain for years in the library of 
one of the public institutions, where it was 
known to only a few inquisitive students. 

The peculiar importance of the volume now 
under review lies in the fact that it embraces 
material, of considerable historical importance 
and interest, that has not hitherto been avail- 
able in printed form. The two documents in 
question, Thomas Jefferson's paper on 'The 
Limits and Bounds of Louisiana,' and William 
Dunbar's Journal of 'The Exploration of the 
Eed, the Black, and the Washita Rivers,' have 
formed part of the collection of historical 
manuscripts in the library of the American 
Philosophical Society, and are now published 
by direction of the Society's committee on his- 
torical documents. 

The Jeffersonian paper was prepared while 
the author was President of the United States, 
and gives a summary of the various claims of 
France, Spain, and England to territory in the 
Mississippi valley, and lays down the bounda- 
ries of the Louisiana Purchase. The original, 
in Jefferson's own hand, was deposited by him 
in the archives of the Philosophical Society in 
Philadelphia, w'here it still remains. The text 
of the paper is prefixed by a transcript of Jef- 
ferson's letter to Peter S. Du Ponceau, Corre- 
sponding Secretary of the Society, transmitting 
the manuscript. This letter throws an intimate 
and very interesting light both upon several 
incidents connected with the Louisiana Pur- 
chase, and upon the personality of the writer. 

The Dunbar Journal is a document that one 
is extremely glad to see in printed form. While 
lacking much of the human interest of the 
Lewis and Clark journals, and recording an 
expedition of comparatively minor importance, 
it is yet of distinct value as a contribution to 
the historical literature of the Southwest. We 
are told, in the ' Publisher's Note,' that Dunbar 



himself was a man of note, and had been hon- 
ored in his native state as ' the first scientist of 
Mississippi.' He was born at Thunderton near 
Elgin, Scotland, a younger son of Sir Archi- 
bald Dunbar, and united ( as so many eminent 
men among his countrymen have done ) prac- 
tical and scientific abilities of a high order. He 
settled in America in 1771, and became a suc- 
cessful planter. Later he held important trusts 
under the Federal government, was a corre- 
spondent 'of Thomas Jefferson, Sir William 
Herschel, David Rittenhouse, and other famous 
men, and made many contributions of import- 
ance to the scientific interests of the United 
States. The exploratory journey, of which the 
Journal now printed forms the record, was 
undertaken at the request of President Jeffer- 
son, in 1804, as 'a part of Mr. Jefferson's 
statesmanlike plan to survey the vast new ter- 
ritory just coming into the possession of the 
United States.' 

The Journal covers a wealth of material 
bearing upon the geographical, botanical, and 
geological features of the country traversed by 
Dunbar, and throws a great deal of light upon 
the condition of that portion of the country 
one hundred years ago. When Dunbar made his 
way up the Red River, the Black, and the 
Washita, to the hot springs that were even then 
somewhat famous, he found only a handful of 
settlers, scattered at long intervals along the 
rivers, and ekeing out a miserable livelihood by 
hunting in the neighboring woods. It cannot 
be said that Dunbar himself was very favor- 
ably impressed with the capabilities of this 
district as a field for settlement, and as a mat- 
ter of fact it remained practically unoccupied 
for many years after his visit. Its chief 
importance, during the first quarter of the nine- 
teenth century, was as one of the important 
routes of Avestern migration from the Mis- 
sissippi to the far West, where the frontier 
was being slowly but irresistibly pushed into 
Spanish territory. 

There was, says Miss Ellen Semple in her 
recent work on 'American History and its 
Geographic Conditions,' an occasional Ameri- 
can planter, at this time, between the Missis- 
sippi and the Washita, and some American 
immigrants far up the Red River, 'while a 
band of adventurers under Philip N'olan had 
penetrated to the Brazos River in the present 
state of Texas,' but the Red River and the 
Washita were not for many yeare to know much 
more than the casual visits of explorers, hunt- 
ers, and those intrepid pathfinders of the 
West who were paving the way for the future 
acquisition of Texas and California. It is 
interesting to note that at the very time that 
Dunbar was making his slow and troublesome

way up the Red River and its tributaries, 
impeded by sandbars or rapids at almost every 
turn, Lewis and Clark were pushing up the 
Missouri toward the Mandan villages where 
they were to spend the winter. 

The make-up of the volume containing these 
documents is admirable, and worthy in every 
way of the important material which it covers. 
The utmost care has been taken to preserve the 
characteristics of the time, as regards spelling, 
typography, and ornamentation. There are 
two excellent portraits in the book, one of Jef- 
ferson, from the original painted by Thomas 
Sully, now in the rooms of the American Philo- 
sophical Society at Philadelphia; and the other 
of Dunbar, from a painting at the family home 
near Natchez, Miss. .The map of Dunbar's 
voyage is a photo-lithograph from a very fine 
copper-plate engraving of Nicholas King's map 
in the War Department at Washington. 

It seems ungracious to say even a word of 
dispraise of such an admirable piece of book- 
making; yet delightful and desirable as these 
exact reprints are from many points of view, 
the student often feels that he would sacrifice 
much in the way of typographical exactitude if 
he might have in return a good index. That is 
the one thing lacking in the present book.

T^vo American Historians.* 

Among recent issues in the group of brief 
biographies known as the '^ American Men of 
Letters' series we have had lives of William 
Hickling Prescott and Francis Parkman. 
Although a full generation lay between the 
careers of the two historians, there is a special 
advantage in this chance association of the two 
biographies thus closely paired. It is not only 
that both these writers are accepted classics in 
the somewhat restricted field of American his- 
torical literature, but a peculiar parallellism 
runs through the records of their lives. Their 
resemblance in personal traits is itself notable ; 
they were affable, refined, thoroughly repre- 
sentative of the traditional New England 
aristocracy of culture; they were delightful 
comrades in the intimacy of their respective 
friendships. Each in his own pathetic expe- 
rience of physical infirmity, heroically defiant 
of disability, and of suffering often acute ; each, 
also, sturdily independent in his fortitude, 
impatient of sympathy, tenacious in purpose, 
and affording in his achievement such an 
example of magnificent endurance as scarcely 
finds a parallel in literary annals except as the

story of one appears to duplicate that of the 
other. It is inevitable that in the attempt to 
portray either of these attractive characters, 
the biographer should write sympathetically, 
not to say enthusiastically, of his subject. 

Prescott was born in 1796, Parkman in 
1823. The former was graduated from Har- 
vard in 1814, the latter just thiri;y years later. 
Prescott's first historical work, the ' Ferdinand 
and Isabella,' was completed in 1836; *The 
Pioneers of France in the New World,' the 
real beginning of the great series which placed 
Parkman's name with the names of Prescott 
and Motley in contemporary recognition, 
appeared in 1865. The first two volumes of 
' Philip II.' were published in 1855, and Pres- 
cott died, his work unfinished, in 1859; Park- 
man was permitted to see the full completion 
of his chosen task ; it was in 1892 that the final 
volume of the series came from the press, fol- 
lowed by his death at the age of seventy in the 
following year. But how bare and colorless 
and commonplace is such a summary of life 
and work! The terrible handicap of failing 
vision, of nervous ailments, of insistent pain; 
the resolute measures to be adopted, the won- 
derful self-control, the ingenious devices of an 
invalid persistently devoted to the accomplish- 
ment of a rarely ambitious task, the interrupted 
labors, the quiet waiting in darkened chambers, 
— these are the details that give a just im- 
pressiveness to the triumphs of eventual suc- 
cess; and in this strenuous fellowship of suf- 
fering and perseverance Parkman and Prescott 
are joined. 

The heroical element becomes so predomi- 
nant in any consideration of either writer that 
we touch for a moment upon this familiar 
ground. The nature of the accident which 
robbed Prescott of the sight of one eye during 
his junior year in college is of course well 
known. Intervals of complete blindness fell 
upon him, and the fear of losing his sight en- 
tirely never left him. Assured by oculists that 
the remaining eye would prove adequate to the 
ordinary purposes of life if he would forego all 
literary labor, the student declined to retreat. 
Calmly he determined that even should sight 
fail altogether, while hearing remained his lit- 
erary ambitions should be realized. The real 
significance of this resolve appears when we 
remember that dictation was impossible for 
Prescott and that the employment of a reader 
in the study of foreign books and manuscripts 
proved unsatisfactory and was often imprac- 
ticable. We meet "in his journal with en- 
tries like these: ^The lasit fortnight I have 
not read or written, in all, five minutes.' 'If 
I could only have some use of my eyes!' *I 
use my eyes ten minutes at a time, for an hour 
a day. So I snail it along.' Parkman's afflic-

tion came from some obscure trouble of the 
brain which not only robbed him of his eyes, 
but affected also the action of heart and limbs. 
His working time was frequently reduced to 
less than half an hour a day, and there were 
long periods of utter helplessness. ' Oh, think 
of what you have done !' exclaimed a lady eager 
to comfort him during an interval of illness. 
' Done !' he cried, his head rising from the pil- 
low, ' done ! there is much more for me still 
to do V Such were the conditions under which 
these men labored, and such was the spirit in 
which they persevered. Partial blindness was 
not the oidy embarrassment; a train of ail- 
ments accompanied and aggravated the condi- 
tion of each. 

It is always interesting to trace the links by 
which a scholar is attracted to the theme 
of his choice. In the case of Parkman, not 
only does the passion for historical study ap- 
pear to have been innate, but his fervid love 
of the woods and the wilderness, together with 
his profound interest in the manners and life 
of our native savage tribes, seems almost to 
have predetermined the chronicler of Pontiac 
to the selection of his romantic field. With 
Prescott, on the other hand, there was a period 
of deliberation and considerable hesitancy in 
the quest of a subject. In 1857 he wrote to a 
friend thus : ' I had early conceived a strong 
passion for historical writing, to which, per- 
haps, the reading of Gibbon's Autobiography 
contributed not a little. I proposed to make 
myself an historian in the best sense of the 
term. ' Spanish literature first attracted his 
attention, as he followed the lectures of his 
friend Ticknor at Harvard. He began the 
study of Spanish in 1825. After the first 
vagueness of his general plan, his mind began 
to settle about two possible topics for historical 
investigation — Spanish history from the inva- 
sion of the Arabs to the consolidation of the 
monarchy under Charles V., and a history of 
the revolution of ancient Rome, which con- 
verted the republic into an empire. This sec- 
ond subject he abandoned as he reflected that 
^the great and learned Niebuhr has been em- 
ployed these dozen years upon it. . . Shall 
I beat the bushes after this? I have not quite 
decided, but I think not.' Literary history also 
attracted him; but the germ of Prescott's 
' Ferdinand and Isabella ' lay in the Spanish 
theme, and after a year of pros and cons, he 
definitely subscribed to that. 

Into the details of either biograpihy it is un- 
necessary to enter here. The reader of Mr. 
Ogden's book will note with interest a few 
new facts concerning Prescott's brave and 
patient life. The style of the book is dignified 
and direct, the material is interesting and well 
arranged. A chapter upon ' Personal Traits ' 



is particularly inviting ; personal anecdotes and 
extracts from letters and journals are liberally 
introduced throughout — material which vivi- 
fies the portrait of the man whose heart was so 
warm that Hillard declared it made Prescott's 
friends forget that he was; a great historian and 
only think of him' as a person to be loved. Mr. 
SedgAvick's volume is proportioned oddly. 
Two-thirds of the book is crowded with par- 
ticulars, significant and insignificant, of the 
historian's early years up to his twenty-seventh, 
leaving less than a hundred pages for the story 
of the long, pathetic, and inspiring life of won- 
derful accomplishment which crovnied a stren- 
uous and strongly assertive youth. It is writ- 
ten vivaciously, even pertly at times. The later 
story of Francis Parkman is too important to 
be disposed of in this brief fashion, and the 
material of the earlier chapters should have 
been sifted. The youthful records of schoolboy 
explorations are interesting, but much of the 
matter could well have been spared. We would 
not, however, miss the pleasant pictures of the 
invalid upon the veranda at Portsmouth play- 
ing with the children and the cats, or cultivat- 
ing the famous rose beds at his residence on the 
shore of Jamaica Pond. In such scenes the 
healthy and genial spirit of Parkman is more 
intimately expressed. w. E. Simonds.

establish itself upon the throne of France; and a 
third meaning will occur to the mind of every 
reader, considering that through this work the 
entertaining talent of the author makes its 
final appeal to the reading public. The scene is 
shifted from time to time between England and 
France, while the period is the middle of the 
nineteenth century, — the year just preceding 
the usurpation of power by Louis Napoleon. One 
is at first a little dismayed to discover that the 
author has once more raked up the old story of 
the Dauphin and the Temple, but fear becomes 
allayed when it is discovered that the legend is 
not taken seriously, but is made to serve only as 
a peg for the hanging of a very ingenious royalist 
intrigue against the Napoleonic pretensions. For 
a time, indeed, we are led to believe that the 
Dauphin did escape, that he was taken to Eng- 
land, grew up, married, had a child, and died 
soon thereafter. In this child of the unknown 
French refugee we have the hero of the present 
romance; but it transpires after awhile that he 
cannot be the nineteenth Louis. Before this fact 
emerges, however, and before the hero himself 
becomes sure of it, he has put himself so imre- 
servedly in the hands of the plotters, and is so 
deeply involved in their machinations, that he 
finds it impossible to withdraw, and so the con- 
spiracy goes on, until the Man of December scores 
his final triumph and all conspiracies against his 
power are made hopeless. We do not quite see why 
the hero should have to be sacrificed in the end 
by drowning him, for he has been alternately in 
love with two interesting young women, one of 
whom he might easily have been made to marry. 
Perhaps the author himself could not decide be- 
tween the two, and so resorted to this cowardly 
evasion of his responsibilities. The story is told 
with all of the author's wonted cleverness, his 
easy knowledge of the world, and his happy 
trick of incisive phrase and dramatic situation. 
It seems to us about as good as any of the books 
that he published during his life time. 

Mr. S. R. Crockett, after dallying for a period 
with romantic adventure in Spain, returns in 
* Strong Mac ' to the Scotch scenes and charac- 
ters which have brought him his most genuine 
success. Since the time is that of the Napoleonic 
wars, he is enabled to introduce a Spanish episode 
of a few chapters ; for the heroine is compelled at 
a certain critical juncture to journey to the Penin- 
sula, and seek out in Wellington's army the sol- 
dier whose presence is needed in Scotland to clear 
her lover from the charge of murder. Of course 
she is successful, and of course the witness ar- 
rives in the nick of time, just as sentence is 
about to be pronounced. Strong Mac is a fine 
specimen of manhood, and the villainies by which 
he is beset serve to bring out the best elements 
of his character. The heroine also finds ready 
access to our hearts. Her father, the village 
schoolmaster, a weak and dissipated person, albeit 
of good family and fine intellectual parts, is per- 
haps the most carefully studied figure in the 
story He never quite loses his hold on our sym- 
pathies, although it is chiefly for the daughter's 
sake that we rejoice when he comes into unex- 



pected possession of the ancestral acres. The 
novel has a very complicated plot, enough mystery 
to keep the reader perplexed until the end, no 
little dry humor, and a wealth of the sort of 
detail that no one but a Scotsman born and bred 
could possibly have at command. The dialect 
feature is pronounced, which makes the book un- 
usually difficult reading, but this time the effort 
is really worth while, — which cannot always be 
said of the kail-yard fictional product. 

Sir Gilbert Parker's Elizabethan romance, 
* The Ladder of Swords, ' is a slight performance 
which opens interestingly, but drags quite a little 
toward the close. It tells of the love between a 
soldier and a maiden of the Huguenot faith, 
opens in that island of Jersey that the author 
knows so well, and presently conducts the persons 
chiefly concerned to London, whither they are 
pursued by the vengeance of the Queen Mother, 
and saved only through the sjTupathy of Eliza- 
beth. The figure of the great Queen of England 
is firmly drawn upon conventional lines, albeit 
they are a little softened by a sentiment that the 
reader finds agreeable, but of which the historiaji 
will have his doubts. The figure of Leicester 
takes on a more sinister villainy than we have 
been wont to attribute to him, but he is of course 
unmasked, as all good villains are in historical 
romance, and his schemes to blight the happiness 
of the lovers are thwarted. There is a court 
jester of the super-sophisticated sort who might 
well be spared. Easily the best-conceived char- 
acter in the book is that of the bluff Seigneur of 
Rozel, who comes from Jersey with the refugees, 
stands by them at need, and returns to his island 
seigneury with enough stories of his amazing 
experiences to last for the rest of his days. 

Mr. E. F. Benson's new novel is called 'The 
Challoners,' after the family which provides it 
with three out of its five leading characters. 
The senior Challoner is an English clergyman of 
the most austere and uncompromising type. He 
has two children, a boy and a girl, from whose 
sympathies he becomes hoj>elessly estranged by 
the exercise of what he narrowly believes to be his 
duty toward them. He loves them, but he nags 
them ; and the nagging makes their life miserable, 
for they are young people of the modem age, with 
individualities of their own. The boy is a musi- 
cal genius of whom his father tries to make a 
classical scholar. The girl is not a genius at all, 
but she knows her own heart, and cleaves to the 
man who loves her in the face of paternal 
opposition. In this opposition is the crux of the 
whole plot ; for her lover is a man who positively 
rejects the religious dogmatism of her father. In 
a word, the story turns upon a situation so old- 
fashioned that we thought it had disappeared 
from fiction for good. It is only by making the 
father a survival of the age of theological big- 
otry that such a situation can be given the slight- 
est degree of probability in our time. How re- 
lentlessly the author depicts this vanished cleri- 
cal type may be illustrated by the fact that the 
daughter is forbidden to read the novels of George 
Eliot. That she does read them in secret, and that 
she smokes an occasional cigarette, are causes of 



SlO 



THE DIAL. 



[Oct. 1, 



offense so great as to be overshadowed only by the 
obstinacy of her love for a man without religion 
in her father's narrow sense. Although this com- 
plication is worked up with a great deal of earn- 
estness, the author does not succeed in making 
it seem real to us. The humorous element in the 
narrative is supplied by a garrulous old lady 
whose conviction is what the French call decousue. 
A little of it proves amply satisfying; and, after 
the first few chapters, we cheerfully skip this old 
lady 's monologues. It seems to us a little wanton 
in Mr. Benson to kill the musical genius in the 
final chapter. He gives us quite enough agony 
without that unnecessary supplement. 

There is no denying the insight and the power 
of Mrs. Voynich 's novels, but there is an element 
of the unreal about them which, combined with 
an infusion of morbid thought and feeling, pre- 
vents them from achieving the highest effects. 
They are so intense in their emotional aspect 
that they suffer as representations of human life, 
which is not, even under the most tragic condi- 
tions, quite so dismal an affair as the author 
makes it out to be. We should place Mrs. Voy- 
nich 's new novel about midway in the scale be- 
tween its two predecessors. ' Olive Latham ' is 
not as hopelessly repellant in theme as was * Jack 
Raymond, ' nor is it as fresh and varied in its 
interest as was ' The Gadfly. ' It is essentially 
the history of the wrecking of a woman's soul by 
suffering, followed by a period in which she hov- 
ers on the verge of insanity, and ending with a 
note of hopefulness as she gradually gropes her 
way out of the valley of the shadow and the bal- 
ance of her nature shows signs of restoration. 
As a study in psychology, this is marvellously well 
done, and the external interest is not inadequate 
to the situation. The heroine is an English 
woman, but her story is primarily one of Russian 
despotism. That it is which does to death her 
husband, a Polish conspirator, and comes near to 
shattering her own reason. If the depth of the 
writer's feelings were matched by a correspond- 
ing clearness of thought and strength of object- 
ive grasp, this book would be much more nearly 
a masterpiece than it now is. 

The hero of * Richard Gresham, ' Mr. Robert 
Morss Lovett's first novel, starts out in life with 
an overwhelming burden laid upon his shoulders. 
His father is an embezzler and a fugitive from 
justice, which fact, declared when Richard is a 
boy of nine, is destined to shape the whole course 
of his life. He grows up with the understanding 
that it is his paramount duty to meet the obliga- 
tions thus incurred, and redeem the family name. 
We follow his fortunes from childhood up; the 
rough farm life of his boyish years, his painfully- 
acquired education, his experience as a mining 
engineer in Mongolia, and his career as a stock 
broker in Ncav York, are the successive phases of 
his history, and they are all presented in a thor- 
oughly interesting and human way. His efforts 
meet with success, but the commercial and social 
influences which suiTound him in New York, and 
his marriage with a woman whose ethical instincts 
are confused, come near to blunting the fine sense 
of honor which has shaped his career, and he 



falters at the critical moment, almost failing of 
the moral victory when it is within his grasp. 
That he should thus hesitate, seems to us, consid- 
ering what his life has been up to that point, 
an element of weakness in Mr. Lovett's book; and 
we cannot quite forgive him for choosing the 
somewhat sophisticated affection of the woman 
whom he marries, in preference to the less calcu- 
lating and more genuine love of his earlier years, 
— the chorus girl who afterwards becomes a star 
of the lyric stage. But these are no reasons for 
our quarrelling seriously with a book which shows 
so much ability, and which is one of the best pro- 
ductions of the current season. 

In Mr. Basil King's new novel, also, as the 
title indicates, a point of honor is made the basis 
of the action. It is a Harvard novel, and the 
leading characters are two young instructors in 
the English department, both aspirants for the 
favor of a young woman in whose veins flows the 
bluest of Cambridge blood. Tke successful aspi- 
rant is the author of a widely-read book upon the 
social conscience, — a work which, unfortvmately, 
he has plagiarized in considerable measure from 
an old and long-forgotten volume. This fact is 
discovered by the other man, who proceeds to 
unmask his rival. For a time, the plagiarist faces 
the accusation with a brazen denial; but the evi- 
dence is too convincing, and he is forced in the 
end to admit his guilt. His engagement is actu- 
ally broken, he resigns his position, and seeks 
secluded lodgings in a Boston suburb. Here he 
works out a sort of moral regeneration, which in 
the end wins back for him something of self-re- 
spect, and — what the average reader will hold 
quite as important — the love that he seemed to 
have lost irretrievably. Thus mounting once more 
* The Steps of Honor, ' he patches up, after a 
fashion, the life that one false step has so nearly 
ruined. Another young woman provides conso- 
lation for the rival, and the outcome is made a 
fairly happy one. Mr. King has given us a faith- 
ful study of life in these academic circles, and 
certain of his secondary characters afford us 
much entertainment. One point we are inclined to 
labor a little, because of its unconscious revela^ 
tion of an attitude not uncommon in our older 
Eastern universities. When the hero 's dishonesty 
is detected, his rival tells him that he must * get 
out ' of Harvard, and go where no one will ever 
hear of him again. He is then advised that ' one 
of the Western colleges ' will be the proper place 
for him, and is promised that if he thus betakes 
himself to the outer darkness no whisper of his 
fault shall go with him. For a story-teller who 
is writing as a professional moralist, this atti- 
tude is, to say the least, peculiar. The episode is 
highly illuminating. We must mention one other 
matter. Mr. King is one of the people who still 
believe (page 27) that witches were once burned 
at Salem. Some superstitions die hard ! 

* The Transgression of Andrew Vane, ' by the 
late Guy Wetmore Caxyll, is a story of the Amer- 
ican colony in Paris. Andrew's transgression is 
the usual one, resulting from his acquaintance 
Avith the frail but fascinating Mirabelle Tre- 
monceau, which in turn results from his falling 



1904.]

into the hands of a designing scoundrel who lives 
upon blackmail. How Andrew is finally forgiven 
by the girl whom he loves, and how the villain 
comes to a melodramatic end, are matters worked 
out with curious ingenuity of detail. A prologue, 
dated before the birth of the hero, is supposed 
to prepare us for the shock of learning his true 
parentage, but is so obscurely written that the 
revelation, when it does come, is too startling to 
be acceptable. After having thought otherwise 
all through the book, we are suddenly called upon 
to believe that Andrew's father is the villain 
who has been seeking his ruin. And the device 
involved for this explanation is a ridiculous story 
of hypnotism used for a malign purpose. We 
cannot admit the legitimacy of this invention, 
but the story is otherwise one of striking inter- 
est, and minutely realistic in its portrayal of the 
fashionable life of the French capital, — at least, 
of such aspects of that life as come readily within 
the foreign visitor's range of observation. Both 
in dialogue and description it is a singularly 
clever performance. 

* The Merry Anne ' is a story of adventure, 
told by Mr. Samuel Merwin. The name of a 
lumber schooner on Lake Michigan gives the book 
its title, and the captain and part owner thereof 
is one Dick Smiley, a dashing young person in 
love with Annie Fargo, a maiden who lives in a 
house on stilts, situated on the shore of the lake 
just north of Chicago. Henry Smiley, who is 
Dick's cousin, Joe McGlory and his wife, who 
keep a saloon near by, and one Bedloe, or Bever- 
idge, a special agent of the United States Treas- 
ury, are other leading characters. And thereby 
hangs the tale. For Henry is no other than the 
notorious Whiskey Jim, the head of a daring com- 
bination of smugglers, who do their distilling on 
a Canadian island in northern Lake Huron, in- 
geniously conceal the product in hollow logs, and 
ship it to Chicago, where McGlory sees that it 
is properly distributed. Dick knows nothing of 
all this, but is brought into innocent complicity 
with the criminals by taking on a load of this 
compromising lumber, and bringing it to Chicago. 
Beveridge, who has long been on the trail of the 
gang, discovers this contraband cargo, which 
makes things look black for Dick. But the latter, 
offering to help in running down the real crimi- 
nals, joins in the chase, which carries the party 
through many desperate adventures, and ends by 
capturing the real Whiskey Jim and freeing his 
cousin Dick from suspicion. Incidentally, Bever- 
idge, who has been Dick's rival with Annie, finds 
that he has no chance in that quarter, and for 
consolation takes up with McGlory 's widow. The 
whole stoiy is worked up very effectively, and 
becomes fairly thrilling toward the close. Mr. 
Merwin does not waste many words upon fine 
writing, but goes straight ahead in an incisive 
and vigorous way, gathering up his loose ends one 
by one and weaving them into a compact yet 
variegated fabric. 

Mr. Harry Leon Wilson's new novel, ' The 
Seeker, ' tells the life-history of one Bemal Lin- 
ford, dealing particularly with his emancipation 
from the depressing orthodoxy of the religious 



belief in which he has been reared. It is a book 
of distinctly didactic purpose, as much so as 
' Robert Elsmere, ' for example, but with little of 
the subtlety and gentle persuasiveness of that 
remarkable work. The dogmatism from which 
Linford revolts as he grows to clear-sighted man- 
hood is of a type that hardly exists at the present 
day, or at least exists in nothing more than a 
simulacrum of its former vitality. Thus the 
author is largely concerned in doing battle with a 
man of straw, and his weapons are as old-fash- 
ioned and discredited as the equipment of his 
adversary. The argument that he uses is of the 
Voltaire-Paine-Ingersoll sort — a kind of attack 
that has done good and effective work in its day, 
but has little force or meaning when applied to 
the spiritualized modem conception of religious 
faith. Mr. Wilson seems to have no notion of 
the philosophical principles underlying the relig- 
ious problem as it exists to-day; he assails the 
literal (and un-literary) interpretation of texts 
and formularies, and scores an easy triumph. 
For the rest, this book embodies enough of a 
story, and of characters in variety, to be readable, 
except for its pages of arid polemics; there is 
also a good deal of charm about the portrayal of 
the hero's childhood, for the work is essentially 
an imagined biography, and begins at the begin- 
ning. It is marred by a straining for original 
terms of expression, which serves only to accentu- 
ate the crudity of the style. 

Miss Frances Powell attracted some attention 
two or three years ago by a novel called * The 
House on the Hudson ' — a melodramatic piece of 
work exhibiting many crudities of diction and 
imagination, yet suggestive in a curious way of 
no less a work than ' Jane Eyre. ' Miss Powell's 
second novel, * The By- Ways of Braithe,' is al- 
most a replica of the first in its setting, its atmos- 
phere of mystery, and its leading types of char- 
acter. It is grossly improbable in plot, and the 
persons who figure in it are constantly doing and 
saying the most impossible things, yet it has a 
certain interest, and one cannot help feeling that 
the exercise of a little thoughtfulness and re- 
straint would make a more than acceptable novel- 
ist out of its writer. Thus far, she strains too 
much for her effects, and is clearly bent upon be- 
ing original and striking at no matter what 
artistic cost. On the other hand, she employs a 
sort of machinery that takes us back into the 
dark ages of romantic fiction, — secret passages, 
mysterious portents mysteriously realized, and 
heavy villainy combined with attractive person- 
ality. Braithe is an old mansion on the Hudson, 
built in exact imitation of an English prototype, 
and its ' by-ways ' are the secret chambers and 
exits of which we hear a great deal, but which 
are finally utilized in a disappointing way only. 

Miss Beatrix Lloyd's ' The Pastime of Eter- 
nity ' is an interesting novel, and it has rather 
more originality than we find in most current 
productions, particularly in first ventures. The 
situations and the climaxes are a little strained, 
and the writer has a propensity for the use of 
strange, imeouth words, which simply irritate the 
reader and add nothing to the expression. These 



212

[Oct. 1, 



are superficial faults, however, and the writer 
maj'^ easily learn to avoid them. Holbein is an 
attractive character, and we cannot quite under- 
stand how he came to be so mismated. The ex- 
planation given us later on does not really ex- 
plain. He has, however, the compensation of 
being loved by two exceptionally gifted young 
women, although he does not discover it for some 
time. When the discovery is made, and his suf- 
ferings have made a sufficient demand upon our 
sympathies, the writer remorselessly slays his 
frivolous wife in an automobile accident, and 
opens the path of happiness for himself and one 
of the young women. The other, necessarily, has 
a hard time of it. The story of the Chevalier de 
Besarique, who starves himself to death when all 
is lost save honor, -is a gruesomely impressive epi- 
sode, and leads to much self-torturing on the part 
of his daughter, who is the favored young woman 
before mentioned. Miss Lloyd has a pretty gift 
of style, of which we shall watch the development 
with much curiosity. 

' The Rose of Old St. Louis, ' by Miss Mary 
Dillon, is a fairly interesting historical novel, 
although one of the hopelessly artificial sort. 
Considered as history, it is a work which shows 
careful study of the documentary material, and 
takes comparatively few liberties with fact. Con- 
sidered as romance, it reproduces for the hun- 
dredth time the two stock figures of dashing hero 
and petulant but winsome heroine. It is a story 
of matters relating to the Louisiana Purchase, 
and, after getting well under way in America, 
takes us to France, where the reader is invited 
to be present at the negotiations for the Louisi- 
ana Territory, and makes a bowing acquaintance 
with the First Consul and other historical charac- 
ters. The heroine turns out to be of royal blood, 
being a cousin of the Prince de Polignac and the 
hapless Due d'Enghien, but this does not prevent 
her from preferring the love of a simple Ameri- 
can gentleman to any pampered minion of an 
effete aristocracy. It is all strangely familiar 
as well as curiously unconvincing. But as such 
romantic inventions go, the story is one of the 
best of its sort. 

' The Effendi, ' by Mrs. Florence Brooks White- 
house, opens with a prologue descriptive of the 
fall of Khartoum in 1885, and the death of Gror- 
don. Two children, a brother and sister of Greek- 
American parentage, are among the inhabitants 
who are taken captive, and it is Avith their later 
fortunes that the story is concerned. When the 
next scene opens, in 1897, and Kitchener's ex- 
pedition is under way, these children, trained to 
Mohammedan life, and forgetful of their early 
years, have grown up; the girl is an inmate 
of her captor's harem, the boy a soldier, the 
Effendi of the title. The scene of the greater 
part of the romance is at Luxor, and three im- 
portant new characters appear — an English 
oflicer under Kitchener, a young English clergy- 
man his friend, and an American girl who has 
known and loved the English officer years before. 
Then follows a pretty series of complications, 
leading to disclosures of parentage and prospec- 
tive weddinsrs. The Effendi is sacrificed in the 



closing chapter, just after the reoccupation of 
Khartoum and the payment of tardy funeral hon- 
ors to Gordon's memory. This seems to have 
been the easiest way to dispose of him, since 
there was no one left for him to love, and his 
recently-discovered European status made it diffi- 
cult for the author to shape a new career for 
him. The story is based upon a number of im- 
probabilities, chief among which is the dual ex- 
istence of Uarda as harem inmate and dashing 
coquette employed to spy upon the English resi- 
dents of Luxor, but it has romantic charm and a 
picturesque setting, which qualities entitle it to 
a hearing and commend it to the favor of the 
novel-reader. 

After all these matters of history and philos- 
ophy, of sensation and social dilemma, it is a re- 
lief to take up such a book as ' The Affair at the 
Inn, ' which has not about it the faintest sugges- 
tion of an idea or a problem or a historical hap- 
pening, but is just frothiness and sentiment and 
playful satire, and may well serve as a sort of 
pousse-cafe for the present repast of many 
courses. It is the joint production of four 
writers, Mrs. Kate Douglas Wiggin, Miss Mary 
Findlater, Miss Jane Helen Findlater, and Mr. 
Allan McAulay. It has four principal charac- 
ters, whom fate brings together at a Dartmoor 
inn, and for each of these characters one of the 
writers is responsible. They take turns in com- 
posing the several chapters of the book, all of 
which are in the first person. The humor of the 
thing results from the fact that every trivial 
episode is described from his individual view- 
point by each of the persons concerned, and the 
contrasts are sometimes as startling as those of 
' The Ring and the Book. ' The result is a 
sprightly and sparkling little story which may be 
read in an hour, and which will leave the reader 
with a good conscience and a sense of cheerful- 
ness. And there is an hour now and then when no 
reader asks of a book more than that.

A valuable 
guide to poems 
and recitations 



It is not too much to say that a 
long-felt want has been in good 
measure supplied by Miss Edith 
Granger's ' Index to Poetry and Recitations ' 
(McClurg), a quarto volume of 970 closely printed 
pages. ' Over thirty thousand titles from three 
hundred and sixty-nine books ' are here indexed 
three and in some cases four times, — in a title 
index, an author index, an index to first lines, and 
a briefer subject index. One feature commended 
to our notice, but not unreservedly praiseworthy, 
is the fact that the 369 books dra^vn upon are all 
in print, and no out-of-print collections of poetry 
or recitations have been laid under contribution. 
Thus we fail to find many an old reading-book 
favorite, like Bryant's ' African Chief ' and 
' Monument Mountain,' Mrs. Barbauld's ' Sea- 
sons,' J. G. Percival's ' Star of Bethlehem,' and 
Mrs. Sigourney's ' Indian Summer.' If some of

the old reading-books, such as Hillard 's, and Wil- 
son 's, and Porter's ' Rhetorical Reader,' and 
' The National Reader ' (to go no farther back) 
could have been included in the sources indexed, 
the value of the work would have been very 
appreciably increased for those of an older gen- 
eration. Indeed, the space required for this 
might without too serious loss have been taken 
from the portion devoted to prose recitations, as 
in the vast majoritj' of cases it is the dimly 
remembered poem, not the schoolboy declamation, 
that baffles our search. And if periodical litera- 
ture also could have been ransacked by our indus- 
trious editor and her co-workers, — giving us a 
sort of Poole 's Index to Poetry, with all the rest, 
— what a triumph were there of the indexer's 
assiduity ! But enough. It would be base ingrat- 
itude not to welcome with hearty praise the very 
scholarly and, so far as a rapid review can deter- 
mine, widely comprehensive and eminently trust- 
worthy index Miss Granger's two-years' work 
(with six assistants, and sometimes more) has 
furnished. The magnitude of the undertaking 
will be apparent to all who have ever engaged in 
similar researches. 

' Imperator et Rex,' the latest 

Martyrdom of an Empress,' 
describes the career of William II. of Germany. 
It is a volume of nearly three hundred pages, 
carefully printed (but for a few typographical 
errors) and tastefully bound (Harper). This in 
praise of the book; but anything further must 
depend upon the point of view and the literary 
taste of the reader. The author declares herself 
* a monarchist ' ready to accept, in its literal 
interpretation, William's famous Regis voluntas 
suprema lex, — which, however, she explains as 
written in the Golden Book of the Munich City 
Council, in jocose compliance with the wish of 
the King of Bavaria that he enter his autograph 
in a book otherwise reserved for the royal line of 
Bavaria. Few American readers will sympathize 
with this view; while the author's florid and 
exaggerated style rather serves to provoke laugh- 
ter than inspire * the dread and fear of kings.' 
As an example of the style may be cited the 
description of William's first meeting with the 
Empress, whom he seems to have disturbed dur- 
ing an afternoon nap in a hammock in the park 
at Sehloss Prinkenau. The passage is nearly two 
pages long; only the concluding lines can be 
quoted : * The grand old trees seemed to whisj>er 
to one another, as did the tall imperial lilies, the 
white meadow-sweets, and the haughty peonies, 
scatt-ered in the grass, that the sight was good to 
behold, and here and there a little thrill of inex- 
pressible gladness seemed to ruffle like crisping 
wavelets a field of anemones of all imaginable 
changeful hues, stretching a porte de vue the silk 
of their shivering corollas beneath the spreading 
boughs.' In the summing up of the Emperor's 
various attainments, we read that * no one pos- 
sessing the full use of his or her senses can deny 
that he is a splendid soldier, an equally good 
sailor, a successful sportsman, a musician of no 
mean talent, an excellent painter and draughts- 



man, a first-class writer and poet too, — a ses 
heures, an engineer and architect of considerable 
ability, besides being a scholar of repute and a 
thorough statesman, without mentioning the fact 
that he speaks nine or ten languages and is one 
of the most eloquent orators of modern times.' 
The book contains practically nothing new about 
the life or personality of the Kaiser. In review- 
ing his career since his accession to the throne, 
we are always prepared to join cordially with his 
loyal subjects in their 'Heil, Wilhelm, Dir und 
Segen ! Das hast Du gut gemacht '; but the ful- 
some adulation of the present work is to be depre- 
cated. It tends to weaken rather than increase 
the honest respect that his steadfastness of pur- 
pose and his able statesmanship have inspired 
alike in friend and foe.

In such a book as Mr. Horatio 
Sheaf e Krans's ' William But- 
ler Yeats and the Irish Literary 
Revival ' (McClure, Phillips & Co.) the poet and 
dramatist finds another leaf to add to his crown 
of bay. The work is fully appreciative of all that 
Mr. Yeats has done in bringing home to the 
English speaking and reading public the beau- 
ties and glamour of Celtic literature, — after, be 
it remembered, the writers in Irish had failed 
through translation to effect what his interpre- 
tations have been able to. The work is in five 
chapters, the first devoted to an entertaining and 
authentic account of the Irish literary revival as 
a whole, the rest specifically to Mr. Yeats 's share 
in it as evidenced by his * Poems based upon Irish 
Myth, Legend, and Romance,' his ' Poems, 
Chiefly Lyrical,' his ' Plays,' and his * Prose.' 
To those unfamiliar previously with the work of 
this comparatively young man, the book will 
serve as a guide to be relied upon in taking the 
neophyte straight to the heart of the movement; 
to those who are already pledged and devoted to 
Mr. Yeats as a vital — some say the most vital 
— force in contemporary English literature, the 
book will appeal as an admirable appreciation of 
his work, done by one like-minded with them- 
selves. But there is one aspect of the ease which 
Mr. Krans does not consider — does not even hint 
at. Ireland through many centuries has been 
almost the most devoted of the nations to the 
Church of Rome. So long has this continued, that 
any inventory of Irish national characteristics 
and literature which does not take it into full 
account, is necessarily lacking. Now Mr. Yeats 
is by his own showing a believer in the undoubted 
paganism and nebulous philosophy and magic 
which he believes to have preceded all 
Christianity as the religion of Erin and the Irish, 
and this particular form of belief has been 
unsparingly denounced by the Church and its 
votaries. It must always be borne in mind, there- 
fore, that the several episodes in the young mys- 
tic's work wherein the powers of black magic are 
shown in triumph over the utmost spiritual safe- 
guards the Church throws about its children have 
brought upon him the final condemnation of its 
authorities and caused his utter repudiation as 
an interpretive force by the overwhelming major- 
ity of his own countrjTnen.

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1^ 



The ethics of 
modern business 
and public life. 



It is no bad sign of the times 
that as partisan rancor disap- 
pears the fame of the late Gov- 
ernor Altgeld shines more and more clearly — 
' a good deed in a naughty world.' His life, 
and his last (posthumous) work to be given to 
the public, ' The Cost of Something for Noth- 
ing ' (Hammersmark Publishing Co.), exemplify 
admirably the pithy saying, ' Practice before you 
preach.' For his life is now understood to have 
been, especially in its more public aspects, a long 
devotion to duty and to cleai'ly conceived ideals; 
and this little book is a homily on the text, 
' Filthy lucre is the root of all evil.' Those famil- 
iar with the details of Governor Altgeld 's polit- 
ical career recall in this connection that, like 
Thomas Jefferson, he went into public life a rich 
man and came out a poor one, — and that, too, 
after the fully authenticated rejection of the most 
enonnous bribes ever offered a public servant. 
It may be conceded at the outset that the book 
contains nothing new; ethical systems have 
changed little in historic time, and there is little 
to be said by any of the world's teachers that has 
not been said before. But there is always tlie 
application of ancient principles to modern 
instances; and it is here that * The Cost of Some- 
thing for Nothing ' obtains distinction. Speak- 
ing from the fulness of exj>erience, w^riting after 
the sweets of power had been tried and found 
bitter, yet animated by a steadfast belief in the 
ultimate goodness of humankind, the author dis- 
cusses nearly every aspect of American life, — 
private, criminal, political, coiporate, clerical, 
judicial, journalistic, feminine, militant, or other, 
— with a pointedness and shrewdness that will 
permit few of his readers to lay all their respon- 
sibility for existing abuses upon the shoulders 
of others. Doing this, he has unquestionably laid 
himself open to a charge of i3essimism; but the 
appeal throughout the book is so openly an appeal 
from what is worst to what is best in human 
nature, so convincingly based on the assurance 
that such appeals are not made in vain, that 
the charge must fall. Indeed, on the other hand, 
the book displays so firm a conviction that all 
wrong's die ' as of self-slaughter,' that more than 
one of us find it almost too unreasonably optimis- 
tic, too bold in its assumption of acquaintance 
with the mighty laws by which man 's place in the 
universe is established. The book is compact and 
easily read, and must take its place with the best 
of those dealing with practical ethics as applied 
to the problems of modern life. 

A new and thoroughly revised 
scientific studies ^•^- f ^ Havelock Ellis 's 

of men and women. , ..^ ^ ^^^ » /o -i \ 

' Man and Woman ' (Scnbner) 
serves to call attention to the great importance 
of this book, Avhieh may almost be said to lie at 
the foundation of a new science, that of human 
sex, considered separately as a branch of anthrop- 
ology, archaeology, physiology, and sociology. The 
first edition of this work made its appeai-ance 
just ten years ago. It was remarkable both for 
what it exhibited in the way of scientific achieve- 
ment within the limits laid down, and for the 
wide gaps in knowledge which it showed to exist 



between the ascertained series of facts. The 
remarkably stimulating character of the work 
finds its proof in the new matter which Mr. Ellis 
has been able to add to this the foui'th edition 
of the book. Many of the gaps have been ade- 
quately closed, and in none is the lack of study 
and research wholly appai-ent. The author's 
speculations have been uniformly accorded atten- 
tion by the great body of specialists engaged on 
the topic; and Avhile a few of these speculations 
have been shoAvn to be defective, a larger niunber 
have been supported by the results of investiga- 
tions painstakingly cai'iied on. Some of the 
ideas, such as that of the infeiior brain capacity 
of Avomankind, have been dismissed into the 
realm of mere suppositions, — quite in the man- 
ner of Voltaire's overthrow of the supposed fact 
that women had fewer teeth than men, brought 
about by the sufficiently simple device of count- 
ing the teeth. What remains as established, or 
on the way to become established, can be read 
with profit by every member of both sexes who 
has arrived at an understanding age, — by par- 
ents, and by employers, especially the employers 
of women. The scientific men and women of the 
United States have especial cause for pride in 
the part they have borne in these recent investi- 
gations; and in their results, as giving Ameri- 
cans certain physical supremacies over the rest 
of the civilized Avorld, the entire nation may take 
delight. 

Granted that a nobly born 
Chinese diplomatist educated in 
Europe and America has the 
usual point of view of the American bourgeois, 
and that it is possible to explain in the Chinese 
language the point and savor of American jests 
of the school of Senator Depew, there is little in 
' As a Chinaman Saw Us ' (Appleton) to refute the 
assertion made by the ' editor,' Mr. Henry Pearson 
Gratton, in his preface, that ' The selections 
have been made from a series of letters covering 
a decade spent in America., and were addressed 
to a friend in China who had seen few foreigners. ' 
The contents display something of the contempt 
Avhich every person reared under a civilization 
that has seen all the historic empires of the world, 
from Egypt to Spain, pass awaj^ and leave it 
flourishing, must feel for American self-assertive- 
ness and bustle; but they fail almost wholly in 
the expression of the deep-rooted aversion every 
Chinaman is known to feel for militarism, — the 
national point of view that sets down the profes- 
sional soldier or sailor on a ship-of-war as a 
hired assassin, to be treated by him as a respect- 
able Chi-istian treats a convicted murderer when 
brought into personal contact with him. This, 
and the rest, suffice to make it more than doubtful 
Avhether a Chinaman ever phrased any of the sen- 
timents here attributed to him; nevertheless the 
book has enough of truth and discrimination to 
make it a valid if not a thorough arraignment of 
American manners, morals, and characteristics. 
Represented as a diplomatist, and so given the 
entree to the ' best ' American society, the crit- 
icism resulting must Jbring delight to the envious 
I ones Avho are without the charmed portal of 



-1 merica through 
Chinese spectacles.

* society,' and suffices to entitle the author to be 
called an ' anarchist ' by those assailed. The 
book is bright and uniformly readable. 

A picture of the incorrigibility 
of genius, — a picture of the 
soul of an artist, ' naively un- 
conscious of the limitations imposed upon life by 
some of us Avho are not geniuses,' — a record of 
a life characterized by passionate irresponsibility, 
such is ' The Diarj^ of a Musician ' (Holt), by 
Miss Dolores M. Bacon. From the grinding pov- 
ertj'^ of a Hungarian farm, through his musical 
training as a violinist at Prague and his introduc- 
tion to the world as a public favorite, this diary 
is a recognition of the ' unknown ' musician's 
genius, — the fruit of whatever was bizarre or 
melodramatic in his career. His vices, quarrels, 
desperate straits, ardent and sometimes simul- 
taneous love-affaii-s, afford great resources for the 
cai'eful editor, who has reason to be grateful for 
a subject that did not dwell in the realms of the 
commoni:)lace forever. There is a certain streak 
of humor running through the diary, yet one feels 
that each jest carries a sting. Genius is said to 
be incorrigible, and many Avill imagine they are 
here reading autobiography; perhaps they are, 
— but it is autobiog-raphy which, as Coleridge 
said of history, has not only been popularized 
but plebifieated.

' A Primer of Physiolog}'^, ' by Mr. E. H. Starling, 
is a recent publication of Messrs. E. P. Button & 
Co. It has the extreme merit of being free from 
the irrelevant paragraphs about the use of narcotics 
which disfigure most books of its class, a fact 
accounted for by its English origin. 

' Machiavelli and the Modern State,' by Mr. 
Louis Dyer, is a volume containing three lectures 
given in 1899 at the Eoyal Institution. Their 
respective subjects are ' The Prince, ' Machiavelli as 
a historian, and Machiavelli as a moralist. The 
numerous quotations are given in the original. The 
central idea of the work is that we should judge 
Machiavelli by the whole of his writings, and not, 
as is so frequently done, by ' The Prince ' alone. 
The book is of much interest, and, although popu- 
lar in manner, is based upon a scholarly study of 
the subject. Messrs. Ginn & Co. are the publishers. 

Since we noticed the first instalment of the 
* Unit Books ' published by Mr. Howard Wilford 
Bell, we have been awaiting with interest additions 
to the collection. Three such additions are now at 
hand: Eenan's * Life of Jesus,' Mrs. Trollops 's 
' Domestic Manners of the Americans,' and an 
extremely useful and well edited volume of 
' National Documents.' These titles speak for 
themselves; it remains for us to say of the books 
that they are supplied with editorial matter of a 
helpful sort, that they are very pleasant books to 
handle and read, and that they are to be had at 
extremely reasonable prices. This enterprise is so 
praiseworthy that M'e wish it every success, and 
trust that the rate of publication may be rapidly 
accelerated. The list of titles announced for future 
publication includes many works that, in this 
inexpensive and tasteful form, will prove a boon 
to the public. 



An Oxford India Paj)er edition of Dickens's 
' Christmas Books,' in five tiny volumes weighing 
together less than two ounces, is announced by the 
Oxford University Press. 

' A Dog's Tale,' by Mark Twain, is a republica- 
tion, in the form of a thin volume, of the story 
recently printed in one of the popular magazines. 
It comes from Messrs. Harper & Brothers. 

A volume of ' Eetrospects ' by Professor William 
Knight, made up largely of personal reminiscences 
of notable English men and women of the Victorian 
era, will be published at an early date by Messrs. 
Charles Scribner's Sons. 

An account of the 'Last Hours of Sheridan's 
Cavalry,' covering the operations of Sheridan and 
Grant after the fall of Petersburg and Eichmond, 
has been written by Brig.-Gen. Henry Edwin Tre- 
main, and will be published shortly by Messrs. Bon- 
nell, Silver & Bowers. 

The feature of chief interest in ' The Printing 
Art ' for September is Mr. Theodore L. De Vinne's 
article on ' The Sizes of Books,' in which he dis- 
cusses the hap-hazard and conflicting terms now in 
general use. It is a paper that publishers and libra- 
rians would do well to ponder carefully. 

Three tales by Eobert Louis Stevenson — ' The 
Story of a Lie,' ' The Misadventures of John 
Nicholson,' and * The Body Snatcher,' — all hith- 
erto inaccessible outside the subscription editions, 
have been brought together as a new volume in 
Messrs. H. B. Turner & Co. 's pretty reprint of 
Stevenson's works. 

Among the books on Mr. Eobert Grier Cooke's 
Autumn list may be mentioned ' Six Incursions by 
a Predatory Pew into Some Theologic Fastnesses,' 
by Edward Augustus Jenks, A. M.; ' Captain Kidd 
and Other Charades,' by Miss Florence L. Sohler; 
' Barclay Genealogies,' by Mr. E. Burnham Mof- 
fat ; and ' The Eoosevelt Doctrine, ' compiled by Mr. 
E. E. Garrison. 

Mr. Henry Frowde is about to publish a limited 
edition, in two volumes, of an exact facsimile of 
the original English edition of the * German Popu- 
lar Stories ' Collected by the brothers Grimm. All 
the illustrations by George Cruikshank which 
appeared in the First and Second Series of the 
stories, issued in 1823 and 1826 respectively, will 
be included, and printed from the original plates. 

Under the general title of ' Life Stories for 
Young People, ' Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. will pub- 
lish shortly translations from the German of the lives 
of Mozart, Beethoven, Joan of Arc, and William 
Tell, written in story form for juvenile readers. 
The Germans excel in this sort of writing, and the 
series should find hearty favor with American chil- 
dren. The work of translation has been done by 
Mr. George P. Upton. 

For some time past there have been indications 
of a marked revival of interest in Eossetti and his 
work. Last Fall no less than three complete edi- 
tions of the Poems were published, all produced in 
more or less elaborate and expensive form. A few 
months ago Mr. Benson's volume gave Eossetti 
place in the select company of the ' English Men 
of Letters ' series; and we have just now had Mr. 
Treffry Dunn's slender sheaf of * Eecollections ' of 
tho poet and his Cheyne Walk circle. In addition 
to a reprint of ' The Early Italian Poets ' in the 
' Temple Classics ' series, the .present Autumn sea- 
son will bring at least two new editions of the com- 
plete Poems. One of these is in the Messrs. 
Crowell 's excellent inexpensive editions of the poets,

witli the editorial matter of Mr, W. M. Eossetti. 
The other is an edition de luxe in two volumes, 
printed on hand-made paper and illustrated with 
twenty photogravures from Rossetti's paintings. 
This also will contain his brother's notes, and will 
be published by Messrs. Little, Brown & Co. 

' A Seventeenth Century Anthology,' compiled 
and edited by Mrs. Alice Meynell, is sent us by the 
H. M. Caldwell Co. of Boston as a specimen volume 
in their ' Red Letter Library,' a successful English 
series that has now found its way across the water. 
The book is of pocket size, well printed on soft 
paper, and prettily bound in crimson leather. The 
head-lines in red ink on each page give a distinctive 
touch, and presumably provide the basis for the 
name of the series. Twenty volumes are now 
ready, nearly half of which consist of Mrs. Mey- 
nell 's selections from the poets. The other titles 
have introductions by critics of such note as Mr. 
Meredith, Professor Harrison, and Canon Beeching.

INDEX TO POETRY 
AND RECITATIONS 

Being a Practical Reference Manual for the Libra- 
rian, Teacher, Bookseller, Elocutionist, etc. 

Edited by EDITH GRANGER, A.B. 

THIS important work, so long delayed by the necessary 
enlarging of the plan, is now ready for delivery. It 
is a volume of incalculable value, and the advance 
interest in its publication is an indication of the practical 
necessity for a book of such scope and comprenension. 
As a labor and time saving reference work it has never 
been equaled, and those for whom it is particularly 
intended should lose no time in placing it on their shelves. 
The work indexes very nearly four hundred standard 
and popular collections of poetry and recitation books, 
including dialogues, orations, drills, etc., comprising about 
thirty thousand titles, arranged alphabetically under three 
heads — titles, authors, and first lines. An appendix con- 
tains lists of titles suitable for special occasions, such as 
Arbor Day, Washington's Birthday, etc., also lists of drills, 
tableaux, pantomimes, etc. These additional helps will be 
of great assistance to those for whom the index is intended.

220 THE DIAL [Oct. 1,1904. 

OXFORD MO DERN FR ENCH SERIES 

The Delegates of the Oxford University Press have for some time believed that, among the many series of annotated 
French texts now being issued, there was still room for a series to be chosen from the best modern French writers who have 
already attained to the rank of classics : writers such as Balzac, Gautier, de Tocqueville, Taine. This series which the 
Delegates are beginning to publish consists not only of romances and short stories, but embraces also narratives of travel, 
biographies, and essays. 

The series is intended primarily for students who have advanced some little way in their knowledge of the French 
langmage, and do not need an explanation of every idiom or phrase somewhat out of the common ; the notes therefore deal 
mainly with points of literary or historical interest. They have been supplied for each volume by teachers and persons of 
wide experience in education. 

The texts have all been very carefully selected with the hope that this series may commend itself not only to school- 
masters, but also to parents and others who wish those under their charge to read good modem French books, and have 
hitherto not known what books could be put into their hands with absolute safety. 

The series is under the general editorship of Mr. Leon Delbos, M.A., Instructor in French in H. M. S. Britannia. 

The following five volumes have already been issued, and others will be ready very shortly : 

La Vendetta and Pierre GraSSOU. By Balzac. Edited by Mane P^chlnet, B.A., Lecturer in 
French in the Royal HoUoway College. 50 cts.

History of Andrew Jackson 

By AUGUSTUS C. BUELL, author of " Paul Jones, Founder of the American Navy." In two 8vo volumes, with 

portraits, plan, etc. $4.00 net. Postage extra. 

In his personality and career Jackson made the same strong appeal to the biographer that Paul Jones had made a 
dozen years earlier. He ransacked old records, old books, diaries, letter-files, and what not in the search for material, 
throwing new light upon Jackson's life and, as in the case of the " Paul Jones," arranged-this material and wrote the 
work con amore. Mr. Buell has made a striking full-length portrait of one of the greatest leaders of men who ever 
lived — a figure which for rugged, native strength and winning, popular qualities is perhaps unmatched in American 
history.

Music and Other Poems 

By HENRY VAN DYKE, author of " The Toiling Felix," " The Builders," etc. $ 1 .00 net. Postage 1 cents. 

This volume (opening with what perhaps is the finest and most elevated of his sustained poems, " The Ode to 
Music") collects the lyrical and other verse which, for some years past, has been establishing Dr. Henry van Dyke's 
high place among American poets. 



Qlir Big Game 

By DWIGHT W. HUNTINGTON. With 16 full- 
page illustrations of Wild Animals. 8vO. $2. net. 
Postage 16 cents. 

The cordial reception which the public gave to Mr. 
Huntington's "Our Feathered Game" has led to the 
preparation of a complementary volume, carried out on 
the same lines and dealing with " Our Big Game " from 
the point of view of the sportsman who is also a lover 
of nature. The work is divided into four books treating, 
respectively, of the individual members of the Deer Fam- 
ily, the Ox Family, the Bear Family, and the Cat Family. 



Monarch, 

The Big Bear of Tallac 

By ERNEST THOMPSON SETON. Nearly a hun- 
dred illustrations printed in two colors. $1.25 net. 
Postage 12 cents. 

This story is one of the most intimate animal studies, 
as well as one of the most thrilling stories, Mr. Seton 
has ever written. It is a return, in kind, to his earlier 
manner, that of the tales in his " Wild Animals I Have 
Known." It is his longest animal story, and is illus- 
trated with nearly a hundred of his marginal line draw- 
ings, besides many full pages in half-tone. 



Fetichism in West Africa 



Forty Years' Observation of Native Customs and Superstitions 
By ROBERT HAMILL NASSAU, M.D., S.T.D. With 12 full-page illustrations. $2.50 net. Postage extra. 
In the routine of mission life, in canoe by day, and in camp and hut by night, the author has penetrated to the 
innermost depth of native thought and has gathered hitherto unknown information about the most secret practices 
of Fetichdom. The result of his observations here brought together constitutes an invaluable addition to ethno- 
logical literature and is a most entertaining narrative.

222 THE DIAL [Oct. 16, 

HARPERS' NEW PUBLICATIONS 

A LADDER OF SWORDS gilbert parker 

BY THE AUTHOR OF "THE RIGHT OF WAY" 

The story recounts the love of two Huguenot refugees and their fugitive life on the island of Jersey and 
later at Queen Elizabeth's court. The scenes are of idyllic freshness and beauty, and in the Seigneur of 
Rogel the author has produced a character of delightful humor and braggadocio. It is a thoroughly 
rounded, satisfying story, written with brilliancy and charm of style. Illustrated. Post 8vo, $1.50. 

VERGILIUS BY THE AUTHOR OP "EBEN HOLDEN" IRVING BACHELLER 

After two years work along new lines Irving Bacheller has produced in " Vergilius " a story of new atmos- 
phere and unusual power. The scenes are those of Ancient Rome ami of Palestine under the dark rule 
of Herod on the eve of the Nativity. The story is one of tender affection and strong situations and the 
final scene is a crowning touch of rare beauty. Post 8vo, $1.35. 

THE SON OF ROYAL LANQBRITH william d. howells 

BY THE AUTHOR OF "LETTERS HOME " 

If not the most interesting novel Mr. Howells ever wrote, this story stands very near that eminence. It 
is unique in that it contains an elderly love story of intense appeal as well as a youthfxd romance. The 
plot is startling and the study of the strange situation most interesting. Crown 8vo, special binding, $2.00. 

THE TRUANTS by the author of "the four FEATHERS" A. E. W. MASON 

An exhilarating story of London life which follows the fortunes of a young married couple living with the 
rich, overbearing father of the husband. Paternal tyranny drives the young man to seek independent 
success, and in his absence the young wife falls under the influence of an adventiu-er. The story develops 
startlingly, and contains many exciting incidents. Illustrated. Post 8vo, $1.50. 

THE LADY OF LOYALTY HOUSE justin huntly McCarthy 

BY THE AUTHOR OF "IF I WERE KINO" 

A sparkling romance of Puritan and Cavalier days at the outbreak of the gi-eat Civil War in England, 
1642. Love makes its way through all barriers of faction and stx-ife, as the story reveals. The incidental 
characters are novel and amusing, and give telling effect to a series of cleverly contrived and brilliant 
episodes. Post 8vo, $1.50. 

THE GEORGIANS by the author of -abner DANIEL" WILL N. HARBEN 

The scene of Mr. Harben's new novel is that of " Abner Daniel," and the author's idea has been to utilize 
the popularity of Abner by making him the chief chai'acter in this new book. There are several subsidiary 
characters, who provide a great deal of mirthful entertainment. Abner himself, with his shrewd humor, 
pervades the whole story. Post 8vo, cloth, $1.50. 

THE FLOWER OF YOUTH roy rolfe gilson 

BY THE author OF "IN THE MORNING GLOW" 

Mr. Gilson's new book is by far his most important work, and is written along the same delightful lines 
of his former successes. It is a story that can be compared only with " Prue and I." The book is full 
of quaint humor and sentiment, and there are many parts dealing with child-life, handled with the same 
simplicity and truth found in Mr. Gilson's earlier stories. Post 8vo, cloth, $1.25. 

LOVE IN CHIEF rose k. weekes 

A pretty English girl is the heroine. She is an aristocrat by birth, but has been reared in the counti'y and 
knows nothing about society. Her piquant love affairs with men more experienced than she furnish the

m THE DIAL [Oct. 16, 1904. 



In a recent review entitled "The Heart of a Boy," the Ne-xv York Times says of 

CLARENCE DARROW'S 

FARMINGTON 

" The book is very cliarming, and in much very true. Not a man who has been a real country 
boy, or who has been cheated by his elders (always with the best motives) of being all the boy 
he might have been, but, if he has grow up to be ripe enough, will seem to find himself 
again in many of Mr. Darrow's pages. 

"He 'spoils the attitude' of the orthodox writers about childhood, insisting (in all love 
and tenderness) on the tragedy of the attempt of parents to mold the life of their offspring, to 
instill virtue into them by precept, to make them pore over their books when all the bounding 
life of youth calls for out-of-doors and play. In the manner of the telling, and in the spirit 
behind the telling, is a reminiscence of Heine, in those autobiographical scraps of his, some- 
thing of the same feeling of the tragedy of the joys of youth missed and gone, something of 
the same serio-comic attitude toward other people's meddlings. 

"Our impression is that Mr. Darrow has shown real art in the handling of one of the most 
difficult forms of literature."

An Index to Poetry and Recitations 

Being a Practical Reference Manual for the Librarian, Teacher, Bookseller, Elocutionist, etc. 

Edited by EDITH GRANGER, A.B. 

"The librarian, bookseller, teacher, will recognize the utility 
of the Index of Poetry and Recitations at a glance, and 
will give it a place beside Poole's. It is presumably the 
most copious index of first lines in existence. The editor 
has set a high example of originality, intelligence, labor-

The work indexes very nearly four hundred standard and popular collections of poetry and recitation books, including dialogues, 
orations, drills, etc., comprising about thirty thousand titles, arranged alphabetically under three heads — titles, authors, and first 
lines. An appendix contains lists of titles suitable for special occasions, such as Arbor Day, Washington's Birthday, etc., also lists of 
drills, tableaux, pantomimes, etc. These additional helps will be of great assistance to those for whom the Indkx is intended.

A YEAR OF CONTINENTAL 

LITERATURE. 
II. 



Continuing from our last issue the summar- 
ies of the ' Athenaeum ' annual reports upon the 
literature of the past year in the chief countriea 
of the Continent, we now present our readers 
with condensations of the articles written from 
Holland by Mr. H. S. M. Croimnelin, from 
Hungary by Miss Kosika Schwimmer, from 
Italy by Dr. Guido Biagi, from Poland by Dr. 
Belcikowski, from Eussia by Mr. Briusov, and 
from Spain by Don Rafael Altamira. We 
regret to note that Greece, Norway, and Sweden 
are missing from the reports of the present 
series. 

Mr. van Wickevoort Crommelin finds a 
marked socialistic tendency in recent Dutch 
literature. Mr. Gorter, the poet-leader in this 
movement, 'has produced a new volume of 
verses which are all but a glorification of social- 
ism.' In prose fiction, this tendency finds many 
illustrations. Mr. Querido's ' Human Woe ' is 
a * tale of the sufferings of poor labourers and 
gardeners who live in filth and misery ; ' Mr. 
Heyerman's ' Diamantstad ' deals with a strike 
of diamond- workers ; Mr. J. Steynen, in hi.s 
' Proletariers,' depicts the lives of people 'eat- 
ing Just enough not to starve;' Mr. J. Everts, 
in 'Klein Leven,' dwells on 'the life of the 
unemployed, of peasants, and on low life gen- 
erally ;' and Mr. van Hulsen has begun a series 
of novels 'in which he is going to depict the 
lives of the outcasts of society.' This seems a 
rather depressing programme for a year's lit- 
erary output, but it is relieved by mention of a 
few works that belong to other categories. 
Among these may be named ' Jacoba van Bei- 
eren,' a poem by Mr. Albert Yerwey, which 
takes us back to the middle ages ; Mr. L. H. A. 
Drabbe's ' Ernst Gronins,' the story of a high- 
school boy, and one of the best novels of the 
year ; the weird ' God en Goden ' of Mr. Louis 
Couperus, in which the ' author seems to have 
soared too near the sun,' with the traditional 
consequences; and Dr. Frederik van Eeden's 
'The Happy World,' in which 'we find Tols- 
toy's self-denial and William Morris's skill 
combined with the far-sightedness of a psychol- 
ogist of great experience and of a man who 
himself puts his prescriptions into practice.' 
A number of works reported in this paper have 
already been spoken of as included in Professor 
FTedericq's account of Belgian literature.

THE DIAL 



[Oct. U, 



Miss Eosika Schwimmer writes from Hun- 
gary and compares the literature of the past 
year to ' a pretty piece of mosaic composed of 
tiny stones, more or less brightly coloured.' The 
place of honor is given to Jokai's last romance, 
* Where Money Is Not Everything,' which is 
described as ' a fantastic story, displaying many 
of the brilliant qualities of our prince of 
romancers, who has died at a ripe old age 
indeed, and yet all too prematurely, for he has 
taken with him to the grave the plans for many 
a book that he might have written.' Other 
fiction includes ' Cloudy Problems,' a novel of 
the woman question by the political writer, Mr. 
Gustav Beksics ; ' Tar jan Denes,' a story of the 
Faubourg St. Leopold in Budapest, by Mr. 
Dezso Balazs ; ' Fruitless Struggles,' by Mr. 
Paul Wolfner; and 'The Outcasts,' by Mr. 
Jeno Heltai, which ' describes in a very modem 
fashion how one may be redeemed from the 
moral degradation of cheating at play.' In 
poetry. Miss Renee Erdos has produced 
' Woman and Her Companion,' which ' has 
almost nothing to commend it save the sonorous 
beauty of its language,' and the lyric romance, 
' Cleopatra,' which is ' a gem of its kind.' The 
greatest dramatic triumph of the year has 
been achieved by the ' Darkness ' of Mr. Max 
Kothauser, a play aimed at the absurdities of 
dueling. Mr. Zoltan Bosnyak's ' Sursum Corda ' 
is an event, ' not only because a high State offi- 
cial has here brought upon the conservative 
stage of the ISTational Theatre the ' Marseil- 
laise ' and the ' Kol-Nidre ' — a synagogal chant 
of the Jews — side by side, but also because it 
expresses a distinctly socialistic idea.' 'The 
King's Bride,' by Mr. Imre Foldes, is the work 
of a boy of twenty, who has won four academic 
prizes within the last three years. Mr. Franz 
Herczeg's ' Byzantium,' ' a tragedy of deca- 
dence, is a magnificent composition, vigorously 
drawn and richly coloured, and will retain a 
permanent place on our stage.' The most impor- 
tant work in general literature appears to be 
Mr. Karl Eotvos's history of the superstition 
regarding ritual murders by the Jews. It is a 
three-volume work, entitled ' The Great Law- 
suit That Has Lasted a Thousand Years, and 
Is Not Finished Yet.' 

Dr. Biagi's Italian contribution is almost 
impossible to summarize, for the reason that it 
is little more than a swollen catalogue of names 
and titles. ' I have chosen,' he says, ' to inves- 
tigate and analyze the whole bibliographical 
production of this year, compiling long notes 
of names and titles, for fear that there might 
escape my view some volume worthy of notice.' 
He has done this so relentlessly as almost to for- 
bid selection on our part. Signor d'Annunzio's 



drama, ' La Figlia di Jorio,' is the one unques- 
tioned masterpiece of the year, and its great 
success makes comment unnecessary. The poet 
has also produced another volume of his 
' Laudi,' ' in which are displayed the highest 
qualities of his genius, which ever aspires after 
new creations, and moulds them in verse.' The 
remaining poetry of the year includes Signora 
Negri's ' Maternita,' and Signor Luigi Orsini's 
'Dall' Alba al Tramonto' and 'II Canne di 
Homagna.' A certain ' Giulio Orsini ' has also 
come forward with ' Fra Terra ed Astri,' a vol- 
ume of verses ' acclaimed by all as a revelation .'^ 
It turned out, after the excitement was well 
under way, tliat the new poet was no youthful 
singer, but the veteran Signor Domenico 
Gnoli, ' a white-bearded bard of sixty-five sum- 
mers.' The theatrical productions of the year 
count as the most noteworthy Signor Oriani's 
tragedy, ' L'Invincible,' Signor Butti's ' Gi- 
ganti e Pigmei,' and Signor Bracco's ' Mater- 
nita,' in which ' a woman, in order to free her- 
self from her husband, accuses herself of hav- 
ing a lover.' Nothing of particular significance 
in fiction seems to have appeared: a few ran- 
dom titles are ' Gli Ammonitori,' a romance 
a la Gorki, by Signor Cena ; ' Nella Vita,' by 
Signor Salvatore di Giacomo ; ' Una Passione,' 
by Signor Neera ; and ' 11 Cavallo di Troja,' by 
Signor Ugo Ojetti. Apart from these belletris- 
tic categories, we find few books deserving to be 
singled out; among these few may be men- 
tioned Signor Pompeo Molmenti's work on 
' Venetian Art,' Signor Achille Loria's ' Verso 
la Giustizia Sociale,' Signor Giovanni Venos- 
ta's ' Ricordi di Gioventu,' and Senator Pier 
Desiderio's ' Gli Anni Secolari,' in which the 
author, 

'As in an historical vision, has attempted to pass 
in review the bygone centuries, and has done it with 
a profound knowledge of the character of each age, 
and in a critical spirit, caustic and highly original, 
that give to these pages a peculiar attractiveness.' 

The recently published ' Epistolario ' of Giu- 
seppe Giusti presents the poet in a new and 
more life-like light than heretofore. The 
Petrarch celebration has called forth much 
interesting matter relating to the first of the 
great humanists. 

Three works in Polish literature are singled 
out from the mass by Dr. Belcikowski, and 
these alone we will mention. One of them is 
Mr. J. Zulawski's play, 'Eros and Psyche,' 'a 
kind of epic in dialogue . . . distinguished 
by excellent versification.' The two others are 
novels : ' Ashes,' by Mr. S. Zeromski, and ' The 
Peasants,' by Mr. W. Raymont. The action of 
' Ashes ' passes ' in the period which begins with 
the last partition of Poland and closes with the 
fall of Napoleon — the so-called Epoch of the 



1904.] 



THE DIAL. 



227 



Legions/ In ' The Peasants ' the ' descrip- 
tions of natural scenery are of extraordinary 
beauty, the manners and customs of the village 
folk are picturesquely and charmingly sketched, 
and from this background emerge the figures of 
lifelike men and women, who undoubtedly 
reflect the character of the Polish peasant more 
truthfully than any of our former romances of 
this class have succeeded in doing/ 

In Eussia, according to Mr. Briusov, the 
most important publication of the year is ' The 
Life of Vasilii Febeicki,' a tale by Mr. Leonide 
Andreev. ' This is the history of a poor village 
priest, who sees around him only misery, and 
who is himself destined to experience all forms 
of human unhappiness.' Mr. Merezhkovski has 
begun the publication of ' Peter and Alexis,' 
which is the third division of his great trilogy, 

* Christ and Antichrist,' already widely known 
to English readers. Two small tales by Count 
Tolstoy are chronicled, as also unimportant 
stories by Mr. Chekhov, Mr. Boborykine, Mr. 
Korolenko, and ' Gorki.' Professor K. Bal- 
mont, who is called ' the most conspicuous of 
contemporary Eussian poets,' has published two 
collections of verse, * Let Us Be Like the Sun,' 
and ' Only Love.' Mr. Chekhov's ' The Cherry 
Garden' is the only noteworthy play of the 
year. It gives ' a series of pictures of the life of 
the Eussian squirearchy painted in a masterly 
way and of types drawn straight from nature.' 
A great many other books are mentioned, but 
it would be invidious to select from them. The 
death of Chekhov this summer has been the 
greatest of literary losses. The war has nat- 
urally retarded literary activities, and, strange 
to say, has produced little or no valuable special 
literature of its own. 

Don Eafael Altamera writes, as usual, a 
lengthy review of Spanish literature, but it is 
little more than a catalogue, and presents but 
few items which seem to us deserving of repro- 
duction. The new play of Senor Echegaray, 

* La Desequilibrada,' was not a success, but the 
two new plays of Seiior Galdos, * Mariucha ' 
and 'El Abuelo ', were enthusiastically ap- 
plauded by the public. The former deals with 

* the value of the will to work in life, while it 
censures the thirst for luxury and for ostenta- 
tious display'; the latter * presents firmly the 
psychological problem of family honour and 
the rigid conception of legitimate birth,' Senor 
Galdos has also achieved success with his 
romance of * The Eevolution of July,' a new 
volume in his ' Episodios Nacionales.' These 
are the works of chief interest in Spanish 
hetles lettres, and space is lacking for us to 
enumerate the important works in other depart- 
ments of literature. 



FILIPINO SONGS AND MUSIC. 



' No,' said the old Mlipina sadly, * the Ameri- 
cano ladies do not care for music. They are not 
like the Spanish or Filipino ladies.' And she 
shook her head again, still more dolefully, and 
walked off to another part of the little music- 
store on Calle Carriedo. 

It was something to think about, this strange 
announcement from a woman of what is popu- 
larly supposed to be one of the most musical 
races in the world to-day; and on investigation 
the answer proved to be as simple as the old 
native woman's belief in her statement. The 
truth of the matter is that the Filipinos, whether 
they be cultured Visayan or savage Bagobo, 
Tinguian or Igorrote dog-eater, have a keenly 
developed sense of metre and rhythm, a quick 
ear, and small regard for such a minor thing as 
harmony. Beyond that, the Filipino does not 
amount to much in a musical way, though he 
has a traditive music that is worthy of passing 
notice. 

Away back in the latter part of the sixteenth 
century, when the valiant knights and priests 
of old Spain came to the newly acquired archi- 
pelago, they found a sort of lyric drama which 
interested their scholars greatly, and many a 
portly and comfortable Spanish tome, now yellow 
and full of the traces of the Philippine book- 
worm, lies at peace on monastery shelves in 
Manila, ready to tell the inquirer, in its quaint 
ancient speech, of what musical conditions were 
at that early stage in the history of the now 
famous islands. Parchment after parchment is 
to be found among the priceless archives of the 
Augustinian and other religious monastic orders, 
giving details of poem and song and chant. Full 
of interest are these old stories, some of them 
with over three hundred years of dust and mil- 
dew upon them, others written in comparatively 
recent years, and still full of fire. All of them 
agree upon one point only,— that among the 
natives of that day there were many who made 
excellent choristers and wrote very acceptable 
music and songs under the direction and supervi- 
sion of the Spanish friars who had the advantage 
of a musical training. Beyond that, most of the 
manuscripts differ widely in their estimates of 
the work of the natives; and while most of 
them declare pointedly that there was no writ- 
ten music of any kind whatsoever, others are 
silent on this point, and still others are so 
expressed as to leave the matter suppositional, 
with perhaps a hint of something that has not 
been found. 

When Delgado, the old historian, wrote his 
famous Philippine history, he made a strong 
argument in favor of the destruction of the old 
native books by the priests, because the people 
needed to be evangelized, and the best way to do 
it was to eradicate any of their old heathen prac- 
tices that might still exist, by burning up their 
books. Accordingly, the priests throughout the 
islands gathered together all the old books they 



228 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



could lay their hands on and piled them up in 
the great square in the centre of each pueblo or 
town, and burned them to ashes. These books, 
it may be said incidentally, were made in a 
most curious manner. The material was a sort 
of dried palm-leaf, prepared so as to be solid 
and enduring without being brittle, and to a 
great extent resembling the Egyptian papyrus. 
The writing was done while the leaves were still 
soft and flexible, with a sharp stylus, and the 
leaves were pasted together, furnished with 
wooden or bark covers, and the whole put away 
to dry. As the friars have left no very clear 
accounts of these early manuscripts (for such 
they were), we are at a loss to know just how 
much of them was religious, how much musical, 
legal, or historical; but the best authorities on 
Philippine matters of ancient times agree that 
the zeal of the priests was a mistake of the 
greatest importance to the musical and literary 
world, as those quaint volumes, — which opened 
like a fan, the right edge of one leaf being 
attached to the left of its fellow,— may have con- 
tained data, or notes at least, which would have 
been of the utmost use in solving several of the 
problems which beset the ethnographer in his 
work to-day. 

Some of the old accounts are amusing in their 
religious fervor and seriousness; and one old 
friar, the celebrated Padre Colin, a Jesuit scholar, 
wrote: 'All that they have is founded on tradi- 
tion, handed down from father to son, conserved 
by its use, and in certain songs, which they 
hold only in memory, and repeat in their naviga- 
tion, to the sweep of the oar, and in their merry- 
makings, fiestas, mortuary services, and even in 
their labors, when they come much together. 
In these songs they recount the fabulous genealo- 
gies and vain deeds of their gods.' One of 
the songs most liked by the natives is the famous 
Lam-ang, which has survived to the present. 
Another very curious song, whose shortness is 
puzzling, considei'ing the characteristics of the 
natives, is to be found up in the northern part 
of Luzon, in the Uocos provinces, particularly in 
North Ilocos. This old song is addressed to the 
' mangmangkik ' or 'anitos' of the trees. An 
'anito' is a sort of reincarnate spirit of some 
dead ancestor, and his habitat is fixed according 
to whatever the need may be in the spirit world at 
the time he becomes a spirit. Some * mangmang- 
kik' are declared to be in charge of the forests, 
and must be propitiated by the woodsmen before 
cutting any timber, so the custom is to chant or 
intone the following. I give both the Ilocano 
dialect, and its practical equivalent in English : 

Barf, barl ! 
Dika agufiget pari 
Ta pumukan kamt 
Iti pabakirda kadakaml. 

In English there is no possible translation for 
Bari, Bari, which is an Ilocano interjection in 
common use in such compositions. The rest of 
the stanza goes: 

Bari, bari ! 
Annoy us not, godfather (friend), 
For we cut only that which 
They command us. 



This address to the guardian spirit of the tree had 
to be made before the cutting was done, as, accord- 
ing to the vulgar Ilocano belief, says Reyes, 
the 'anitos' or ' mangmangkik ' are easily 
offended, have the power of vengeance to a 
great degree, and can afflict their human enemies 
with very grave infirmities if the latter trans- 
gress. Based on this song and superstition is a 
stoiy, written for the last Filipino exposition in 
Madrid, in which there appears to the hero of the 
tale a ' mangmangkik ' in human shape, when the 
former was attempting to cut down a tree with- 
out having first appeased the demigod. 

Other songs are sung to this day among the 
natives of Leyte, Samar, Mindoro, and others of 
the islands in the Visayan section of the archi- 
pelago, and relate, to a certain extent, as in the 
days of Colin, the 'vain deeds' of the old gods, 
mixed with curious references to semi-European 
lords and chiefs, and the whole twisted into a 
fantastic sort of appeal to the particular god 
whose domain the singer is traversing at the 
time. In Mindanao, the Moros, Bagobos, and 
others, have a sort of war-chant which they use 
to screw their courage up to the sticking-point; 
while in the farther islands priests of the various 
orders have discovered some other curious and 
interesting relics of the age of rhythm, which has 
not yet entirely disappeared. 

In their modem music, the Filipinos are not 
particularly happy in conception or execution. 
Their music is either a hodge-podge of stealings, 
jerky or uncertain in time, without solid motive, 
and lacking in originality, or else it is a simply 
rhythmic production, a series of semi-harmonic 
and almost distinct musical stanzas, connected, 
like the parts of a medley, by excuses. As for 
their execution of what is good, the writer has 
seen time after time in the best theatre in Manila, 
conversation going on steadily between various 
members of the orchestra during a piece; some 
of the players would work with their eyes shut, 
and dreamily scrape away, a cigarette tucked 
behind a convenient ear ready for instant use^ 
and a generally bored expression indicating lassi- 
tude and a desire to get out,— though that same 
band will parade all over town and play eighteen 
hours at a stretch the night before Christmas or 
New Year's, passing the begging hat steadily 
to sleepy, angry citizens in bed.

The 'Histoire de la Litterature Grecque' of the 
MM. Croiset has been for many years a work of 
favorable repute, and the abridgement of the com- 
plete work, published in 1890, has also won much 
deserved praise for trustworthy scholarship and 
agreeable manner of presentation. This abridgment

The Conway Autobiography.* 



Dr. Holmes once said to a friend, ' You and 
I have spent many of the best years of our lives 
merely clearing theological rubbish out of our 
paths. ' That friend^s autobiography, which is 
about to be published, is the record of this clear- 
ing-away of theological and other rubbish, — a 
labor that every earnest soul is bound to under- 
take in the effort to find itself. That the record 
in the present instance is well worth the read- 
ing, no one at all familiar with Mr. Moncure D. 
Conway's life and writings will for a moment 
•doubt. Belonging to a Methodist slave-holding 
family of Virginia, he had to encounter bitter 
opposition from those nearest and dearest to 
■him before he succeeded in shaking off the tram- 
mels that fettered his freedom of growth. 

After graduating at a very early age from 
Dickinson College, he essayed journalism with 
•considerable success, and then rode the circuit 
two years as a Methodist preacher. Then, not 
jet twenty-one years old and still groping for 
light, the versatile youth severed his church and 
family ties and made his way to Cambridge, 
where he entered the Harvard Divinity School. 
It was Emerson's writings that had opened his 
■eyes to the spiritual realities, and to him he had 
written confessing his doubtings and question- 
ings. An answer came, sage and sympathetic, 
admirable for its wise restraint and careful 
Tiandling of delicate matters. The closing para- 
graph is as follows : 

'I am interested by your kind interest in my writ- 
ings, but you have not let me sufficiently into your 
-own habit of thought, to enable me to speak to it 
with much precision. But I believe what interests 
"both you and me most of all things, and whether we 
know it or not, is the morals of intellect; in other 
words, that no man is worth his room in the world 
who is not commanded by a legitimate object of 
thought. The earth is full of frivolous people, who 
are bending their whole force and the force of 
nations on trifles, and these are baptized with every 
grand and holy name, remaining, of course, totally 
inadequate to occupy any mind; and so sceptics are 
made. A true soul will disdain to be moved except 
by what natively commands it, though it should 
go sad and solitary in search of its master a thou- 
sand years. The few superior persons in each com- 
munity are so by their steadiness to reality and 
their neglect of appearances. This is the euphrasy 
and rue that purge the intellect and ensure insight. 
Its full rewards are slow but sure; and yet I think 
it has its reward on the instant, inasmuch as sim- 
plicity and grandeur are always better than dap- 
perness. But I will not spin out these saws farther, 
but hasten to thank you for your frank and friendly 
letter, and to wish you the best deliverance in that 
contest to which every soul must go alone.'

MoNcuRE Daniel Conway. In two volumes. Illustrated.

At Emerson's house and among Emerson's 
Concord friends the young divinity student 
spent many delightful hours, the record of 
which will be to not a few readers the best part 
of the ' Autobiography. ' From the fresh 
glimpses it gives of the New England immor- 
tals must be taken this delightful bit of conver- 
sation between Agassiz and Alcott: 

'There was at Concord a course of lectures every 
year, one of which was given by Agassiz. His com- 
ing was an important event. He was always a guest 
of the Emersons, where the literary people of the 
village were able to meet him. On one such occa- 
sion I remember listening to a curious conversa- 
tion between Agassiz and A. Bronson Alcott, — who 
lived and moved in a waking dream. After delight- 
ing Agassiz by repudiating the theory of the 
development of man from animals, he filled the pro- 
fessor with dismay by equally decrying the idea 
that God could ever have created ferocious and poi- 
sonous beasts. When Agassiz asked who could have 
created them, Alcott said they were the various 
forms of human sin. Man was the first being 
created. And the horrible creatures were originated 
by his lusts and animalisms. When Agassiz, bewil- 
dered, urged that geology proved that the animals 
existed before man, Alcott suggested that man 
might have originated them before his appearance 
in his present form. Agassiz having given a signal 
of distress, Emerson came to the rescue with some 
reconciling discourse on the development of life 
and thought, with which the professor had to be 
content. ' 

Mr. Conway's father, a well-to-do manufac- 
turer, could not conscientiously give his son 
either moral or pecuniary support in a course 
that seemed to him so full of error, and the 
young man was consequently straitened for 
means and somewhat dependent on northern 
friends and sympathizers. A letter from the 
father to his son when the latter was called in 
1854 to his first parish, the Unitarian church 
in Washington, will convey an idea of the oppo- 
sition the young clergyman had to withstand 
from those whose unsympathetic attitude must 
have caused him the deepest anguish. 

' You say in your last it is strange that you ' * meet 
with intolerance nowhere but at home." If you 
had but a small amount of that best of all sense — 
common sense — it would not seem at all strange 
that such should be the fact. I should treat all 
young men similarly situated just as you are treated 
by others — but their parents and best friends would 
probably do towards them just as your parents and 
friends do towards you. A single moment's reflec- 
tion would teach any common-sense person the rea- 
sonable propriety of our course. But having 
exhausted all our rational effort, we hand you over 
to the mercy of God, through our Lord and Saviour 
Jesus Christ, and pray most earnestly that the ever- 
blessed Spirit may guide you aright. If you make 
shipwreck in this life and the next, you must not 
only wade through the precious blood of Christ and 
do despite to the Spirit of His grace — but your 
father's prayers, so long as his life lasts, will be 
thrown in the way also.'

seemed to be the cause most urgently demand- 
ing his championship; and because he refused 
to exclude the subject from his sermons he was 
dismissed from his pulpit after a two-years' 
occupancy. But a call to Cincinnati very soon 
followed, and there he enjoyed greater freedom 
of speech. Not on slavery alone did he pro- 
nounce himself with emphasis, but on all sub- 
jects that seemed to him profitable for discus- 
sion. Thus it was that he became the defender 
of the stage at a time when, and in a com- 
munity where, all ministers of religion were 
expected to use their influence against the thea- 
tre. 

'Eegarding that institution as one of the most 
important for the culture of the community, I gave 
a discourse on this subject (June 7, 1857), compar- 
ing the clerical enemies of the theatre to Jonah 
demanding the destruction of Nineveh. The subject 
of my discourse having been as usual announced 
in the papers, a large audience came; it was said 
that every actor and manager was present. The 
discourse was published in pamphlet form and 
widely circulated. I became thenceforth a sort of 
chaplain to the actors, conducting their marriages 
and funerals, and whenever I attended any theatre 

I was invited into a private box But the 

most important response received was a letter from 
my mother stating that the pamphlet on the theatre 
had been read aloud in the family by my father, 
who on closing it said, "I am not prepared to 
object to one word in it." ' 

Even as early as 1860 Mr. Conway's interest 
in Thomas Paine, whose biography he was to 
write and whose works he was to edit many 
years later, was an absorbing one. In a small 
society of so-called infidels in Cincinnati he 
heard enthusiastic eulogies of Paine and lis- 
tened to the exposure of the traditional calum- 
nies that had long made him an object of abhor- 
rence to the devout; and in these flagrant mis- 
representations the young free-thinker believed 
he discovered a recrudescence of the old folk- 
lore about the Wandering Jew and about Faust. 
He was reminded of the saying that 'towers 
may be measured by the shadows they cast. ' 
Surely, he said to himself, this man must have 
been a very Leviathan of f ree- thought ; and he 
began to study his life and works. The inune- 
diate result of these researches was an announce- 
ment 

'That on Paine 's birthday, Jan. 29, 1860, the subject 
of my sermon would be Thomas Paine. The church 
was crowded. I had feared that my pleading for 
Paine might excite some opposition in my congrega- 
tion, or at least some remonstrance on my impru- 
dence; but instead of that I received next day a 
request to publish my discourse. It was signed by 
many eminent and wealthy citizens, some of whom 
did not belong to my congregation; their letter and 
names were printed as the preface of the sermon, 
which bore the title: "Thomas Paine. A Celebra- 
tion," From that time the freethinkers frequented 
my church, and I arranged that there should be 
each week an evening of discussion with them. 1 
had gained their goodwill, and Moreau, a leading 
writer of their faith, — for it was a fervent faith, — 



dedicated a volume to me as the first who had ever 
uttered from a pulpit any word favorable to Paine. ' 

Another interesting episode of the Cincinnati 
pastorate has to do with the brief but honorable 
life-history of the * Dial, ' a monthly magazine 
of the highest class, which lived just one year, 
the twelve months of 1860. The founder and 
editor thus tells the story of its origin : 

'My theological and philosophical heresies re- 
ported in the Ohio journals excited discussion far 
and near. The papers teemed with controversial 
letters, and a magazine became inevitable. Its first 
number appeared in January, 1860, bearing the 
title: "The Dial: a monthly magazine for litera- 
ture, philosophy and religion. M. D. Conway, Edi- 
tor. Horas non numero nisi serenas. Cincinnati: 
Office, No. 76 West 3rd Street. 1860." At the end 
of my prefatory word it was said: "The Dial 
stands before you, the reader, a legitimation of the 
Spirit of the Age, which aspires to be free: free 
in thought, doubt, utterance, love and knowledge. 
It is, in our minds, symbolized not so much by the 
sun-clock in the yard, as by the floral dial of Lin- 
naeus, which recorded the advancing day by the 
opening of some flowers and the closing of others: 
it would report the Day of God as recorded in the 
unfolding of higher life and thought, and the clos- 
ing up of old superstitions and evils: it would be a 
Dial measuring time by growth." ' 

The magazine was well received, had a large 
subscription list, and numbered among its con- 
tributors Emerson, 0. B. Frothingham, Mr. 
Howells, and other writers of note. A cordial 
greeting to the new paper was extended, 
anonymously, by Mr. Howells in the 'Ohio 
State Journal ' of Columbus ; and this led to a 
literary and personal friendship between the 
two young men of letters, the details of which 
furnish some very pleasant reading. But the 
temper of the times — the stormy days of 1860- 
61 — proved unfavorable to the continuation of 
the paper, and thus ended the brief course of 
the second of the three ' Dials ' that figure in 
our literary annals. 

In the summer of 1863 Mr. Conway accepted 
the offered editorship of the ' Commonwealth, ' 
a paper about to be started in Boston in the 
interest of immediate emancipation of the 
negro. He made his home in Concord, largely 
influenced, one cannot but surmise, by the pros- 
pect of being near Emerson, after whom he had 
named a son. Of the appearance of this anti- 
slavery paper he says: 

'The "Commonwealth" began with September, 
1862. Frank B, Sanborn was associated with me 
in editing it. We were friends at Harvard, and 
he was the only student there who held Emerson 
in a reverence equal to my own. After graduation 
he had settled at Concord and we were in constant 
communication. We had a vigorous antislavery 
governor of Massachusetts, John A. Andrew, who 
had protested against the use of soldiers from his 
State to return fugitive slaves. The "Common- 
wealth" was recognized as a sort of organ of the 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts in its relation to 
the national crisis. There was no rivalry nor fric- 
tion between our paper and the ' ' Liberator. ' ' That

paper was edited by Mr. Garrison with great 
vigour, but he recognized clearly the advantage of 
starting the new journal. Sanborn and I were often 
in consultation with him and Wendell Phillips.' 

In the spring of 1863 Mr. Conway went to 
England, his mission being to enlist English 
sympathy on the side of the North in our war, 
and to lecture and write with that end in view. 
Two letters a week were also to be sent home 
to the ' Commonwealth. ' Of his English 
experiences, the many eminent persons he met, 
and the memorable things they said, lack of 
space forbids even the briefest account here. 
The English mission opened the way to his set- 
tlement, in 1864, as minister of South Place 
Chapel, a post which he retained for twenty 
years; and even after that he still clung to his 
adopted home, so that now he is probably more 
often thought of as an Englishman than as an 
American. 

Of Martineau the author has things of inter- 
est to say, and a comparison is drawn between 
him and Emerson, two men whom one feels 
more inclined to contrast than to compare. Car- 
lyle also figures frequently in his pages, and 
many facts are related that help to explain the 
lamentable performance of the great man's lite- 
rary executor. Froude, we are told, never really 
knew Carlyle, and he rushed his biography and 
reminiscences into print in feverish alarm lest 
another's pen, possibly Mr. Conway's, should 
anticipate him, whereas the vast and perplexing 
mass of material on his hands should have occu- 
pied his best energies for many months in the 
sifting. Noteworthy evidence is given by our 
author of the domestic harmony enjoyed by 
Carlyle and his wife. Mrs. Alexander Carlyle 
once said to Mr. Conway, ' If uncle and aunt 
lived unhappily I never discovered it, none of 
their relatives knew it, and I am sure they did 
not know it themselves. Mr. Froude alone 
knows it.' 

One pleasing glimpse of our lamented Arte- 
mus Ward clamors for insertion here. 

' "Artemus the delicious," as Charles Beade 
called him, came to London in June, 1866, and gave 
his "piece" in Egyptian Hall. The refined, deli- 
cate, intellectual countenance, the sweet, grave 
mouth from which one might have expected philo- 
sophical lectures, retained their seriousness while 
listeners were convulsed with laughter. There was 
something magical about it. Every sentence was a 
surprise. He played on his audience as Liszt did 
on a piano — most easily when most effectively. 
Who can ever forget his attempt to stop his Italian 
pianist — * * a count in his own country, but not much 
account in this" — who went on playing loudly 
while he was trying to tell us an "affecting inci- 
dent" that occurred near a small clump of trees 
shown on his panorama of the far west. The music 
stormed on; we could see only lips and arms pathet- 
ically moving, till the piano suddenly ceased, and 
we heard — it was all we heard — * ' and she fainted 
in Eeginald's arms." His tricks have been 
attempted in many theatres, but Artemus Ward was 



inimitable. And all the time the man was dying. 

Never was American in London so beloved 

When it was learned that the most delightful of 
men was wasting away under rapid consumption 
even while he was charming us, the grief was inex- 
pressible. ' 

It is worth noting that of all the London 
clubs that have solicited Mr. Conwa/s member- 
ship, the one in which he has taJcen the liveliest 
interest is the Omar Khayyam Club. He is a 
true Omarite and, of course, an admirer of 
Edward FitzGerald, in the rose-planting pil- 
grimage to whose grave he took part. * Then we 
went over to Edward Clodd's country homestead 
at Aldeburgh, " Strafford House," and remained 
from that Saturday till Monday. Fill in from 
your imagination, my reader, the charm and 
beauty of this function and of our symposia at 
Strafford.' 

The latter half of the ' Autobiography,' deal- 
ing chiefly with affairs in England and with 
English persons of note, contains hardly a dull 
page or paragraph; but it .is the first part, the 
American part, depicting the author's early 
struggles and growth, that will most interest 
him who seeks a better acquaintance with Mr. 
Conway. Among the good causes he has been 
ever active to promote, there stands out as per- 
haps the one in which he has most earnestly 
exerted himself, the cause of peace, his horror 
of war having long ago prompted him to zeal- 
ous advocacy of the abolition of slavery by pur- 
chase. A larger, richer, truer life, chronicled 
with more wealth of detail and greater charm of 
simple, direct narration, embellished with 
timely anecdote, it would be hard to find. The 
writer's memory appears to be an inexhaustible 
storehouse of reminiscences that cannot fail to 
please. Pebcy F. Bicknell. 



A Notable Scientific Expedition.* 



Headers of The Dial may recall the fact 
that in the Summer of 1899 a company of 
twenty-five representative scientific and literary 
men of this country visited our 'land of the 
midnight sun' in the steamship * Elder,' as 
guests of Mr. E. H. Harriman. While the 
immediate purpose of the expedition was at first 
the full realization of the pleasures of travel 
and the quest of big game, the outcome was a 
many-sided scientific exploring expedition of 
surprising proportions. The large hospitality

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



manifested in the organization of the ' Harri- 
man Alaska Expedition' has been continued 
with a generosity that has spared no expense 
in the illustration and publication of the narra- 
tive of the voyage and of its scientific results 
in the best attainable form. The start was 
made in the publication, in 1901, of the first 
two volumes devoted to the narrative of the 
expedition, and to papers of a literary nature 
and those treating of the less technical scientific 
subjects. These volumes were models of the 
printer's art, and touched high-water mark in 
the field of illustration. The continuation of 
the work appears in the three handsome volumes 
on ' Glaciers,' ' Geology,' and * Cryptogamic 
Botany.' Others devoted to biological subjects 
will follow, and the finish is not yet in sight. 

These volumes are under the skilful editor- 
ship of Dr. C. Hart Merriam, of the Biological 
Survey of the Department of Agriculture at 
Washington. Of necessity they are composites, 
the work of many expert hands; and some of 
the papers here combined in book form have 
previously appeared in the Proceedings of the 
Washington Academy of Sciences, which col- 
laborated with the Harriman Alaska Expedi- 
tion in the publication of its scientific results. 
For bibliographical purposes in citation, the 
original pagination is given, as well as that of 
the volume in which the reprinted papers are 
here published. Simplicity and directness stamp 
the editorial make-up of this series, in marked 
contrast with the cumbersome, confusing, and 
elaborate method of subdivision and designation 
adopted in some German Reports of scientific 
expeditions. In paper, typography, illustra- 
tions, and binding, these volumes leave nothing 
to be desired by the most fastidious lover of 
fine books ; while at the same time there is noth- 
ing in their make-up to offend the sense of fit- 
ness. The work of our best American engrav- 
ers and scientific artists appears here; and the 
work is well done. 

The third volume of the series is fittingly 
devoted to the unique element in the landscape 
of Alaska, the phenomena of prime interest not 
only to the visiting scientist but also to the 
passing traveller, to the principal product of the 
territory, — the glaciers. This volume is entirely 
from the pen of Dr. G. K. Gilbert of the TJ. S. 
Geological Survey, who accompanied the expe- 
dition. It is based on his observations in the 
Summer of 1899, supplemented by information 
from various sources, and illustrated by over 
a hundred text figures and eighteen plates. The 
drawings from which these illustrations are 
made were the work of Mrs. Louise M. Keeler 
and Mr. W. E. Spader. Students and teachers 
of physical geography desiring illustrations of 
the phenomena of glaciation will find in this 
work a list of photographs used in illustration, 



and information as to where duplicates may be 
obtained. Alaska presents unsurpassed oppor- 
tunities to the student of glaciers, and its great 
ice-fields may be easily reached by comfortable 
steamers. Dr. Gilbert says: 

'The glacier-bearing belt includes about three- 
tenths of the vast territory of Alaska. Its explora- 
tion has but just begun, yet enough is known tO' 
give it rank as the third great glacier district of the 
world, only the Antarctic continent and Greenland 
surpass it. Its ice may be roughly estimated to 
occupy a tenth of the surface, or an absolute area 
of between 15,000 and 20,000 square miles, and its 
expanse is so divided and scattered as to offer to 
the student the utmost variety of local conditions 
and detail. Of alpine glaciers, such as would receive 
individual names if near the homes of men, there 
are many hundreds, possibly more than a thousand; 
of broad composite fields, like the Muir and Mala- 
spina, there are about half a dozen; and more than 
thirty are known to reach the coast and cast bergs 
into the sea.' 

Naturally, the observations of the Harriman 
party were limited largely to the tidal glaciers 
which empty into the sea, and are easily acces- 
sible by steamer. We find, therefore, that most 
of the report deals with the glaciers about 
Glacier and Yakutat Bays. Near the latter, in 
College Fiord, several new glaciers were found, 
and were named in honor of leading universitiei? 
and colleges in New England. The most strik- 
ing discovery was that of a new fiord of large 
proportions, in a secluded pocket among the 
mountains, into which empties a large number 
of fine glaciers. Both the fiord and the mag- 
nificent terminal glacier were named in honor 
of the host of the expedition. 

Dr. Gilbert's treatment of his subject is 
exhaustive; and though couched in technical 
terms, and presented with scientific precision 
and compactness, it is nevertheless very read- 
able because of his logical method of presenta- 
tion and clearness of statement. It forms an 
indispensable guide for every student and trav- 
eller who visits the shores of Alaska and desires 
an intelligent appreciation of these ma^ificent 
rivers of ice. 

The fourth volume of the series is devoted to 
Geology and Palaeontology, and is both more 
varied and more technical than the preceding 
volume on Glaciers. The opportimities for 
geological work were conditioned by the mode 
of travel, the route, the location, and the length 
of stops; so that this report is largely in the 
nature of a brief reconnaisance of some of the 
more accessible features. Professor Gilbert 
writes the introductory chapter; Professor 
Emerson discusses the General Geology; Pro- 
fessor Palache describes the geological features 
of the famous Treadwell Mine at Juneau, the 
geology about Chicagof Cove, and writes the 
chapter on Minerals ; Dr. W. H. Dall treats of 
the Mesozoic Invertebrate Fossils; Dr. Ulrich 
describes the fossils from, and discusses the age

of, the Yakutat formation; and Dr. Knowlton 
furnishes an abundantly illustrated chapter on 
Fossil Plants. Fragmentary as the data obtained 
by this expedition were, they nevertheless suf- 
fice to indicate the geological age of some points 
on the coast of Alaska, and afEord some impor- 
tant evidence bearing on the correlation of th-e 
age of different localities. Palaeontological col- 
lections included thirty-eight new species and 
seven new genera belonging to the Jurassic and 
Eocene. 

The fifth volume of the series is devoted to 
the Cryptogamic Botany of the expedition, — 
to the fungi, lichens, algas, mosses, hepatics, 
and ferns of Alaska. The volume has had the 
immediate editorial supervision of Professor 
William Trelease, Director of the Shaw Botan- 
ical Gardens of St. Louis; and his hand has 
prepared the very readable Introduction, as 
well as the chapter on the ferns. The cosmo- 
politan character of modem science is well illus- 
trated by the fact that Italian, French, and 
German, as well as American, specialists have 
contributed signed articles to this volume, in 
some instances in joint authorship. The nar- 
row lines within which the specialist of to-day 
must work is further suggested by the fact that 
about forty botanists contribute to this volume, 
either directly as authors, or indirectly as con- 
sulted experts. The net result of these botan- 
ical explorations is a compact and succinct sur- 
vey of the cryptogamic flora of Alaska, showing 
a total of 1616 species, of which a number are 
new to science. 

The high standard of excellence maintained 
throughout the volumes of this series, — the 
thick linen paper of the best grade, the lavish 
illustrations in line, half-tone, and color, the 
triple covers to the simple and elegant bind- 
ing, — all suggest that no expense has been 
spared to make this publication noteworthy 
among the reports of scientific expeditions here 
or elsewhere. The question might be, and 
indeed has been raised, as to whether the money 
thus spent might not have been better used. To 
be sure, it might have published many more 
scientific papers than will appear in these four- 
teen volumes! But after all is said, there 
remains this superb ensample of what can be 
done; and though all subsequent scientific pub- 
lications may not attain to a like sumptuous 
apparel, there are few which will not be stimu- 
lated by this model to strive for the best in 
form, materials, and illustration. Many, though 
not all, of our American scientific publications 
have been in the past, and some are even yet, 
distinctly cheap and shabby in comparison with 
most continental publications of equal rank. 
May the Harriman Alaska Expedition be an 
omen of better days! 

It is perhaps typical of the spirit of our time 



that what was originally planned as a family 
pleasure-trip, with generous hospitality, should 
turn out to be a scientific expedition of unex- 
pected proportions. It was inevitable that such 
a group of men of thought and action as com- 
posed the Harriman Alaska Expedition should 
have produced this permanent contribution to 
the sum of the world's knowledge.

The Hero of a Lost Cause.* 



It is unlikely that history affords another 
instance where the leader of a losing cause suc- 
ceeded in retaining the love, admiration, and 
respect of his followers, and even of his enemies, 
to the extent noted in the case of General Kob- 
ert E. Lee. Friends and foes alike pay tribute 
to his worth as a man, his ability as a soldier, 
and his heroism under crushing defeat. Now 
that the acerbities growing out of civil strife 
have been softened by time, it is safe to say 
that there is no American, North or South, 
who does not gladly enroll him among the most 
eminent of his fellow-countrymen. And the 
book of ' Recollections and Letters ' prepared 
by his son and namesake will deepen this 
impression, at the same time that it proves the 
son to have no small share of the candor, vera- 
city, and magnanimity of his highly distin- 
guished father. 

The common experience of mankind attests 
that ' blood will tell ' ; and certainly there is no 
family boasting prouder achievements among 
the various branches of its stock than the Lees 
of Virginia. This book notes that at the con- 
clusion of the Civil War, Englishmen of means 
offered General Lee an estate and income in 
their own country commensurate with ' the dig- 
nity of an historic family. ' It was declined, 
needless to say ; for if the traditions of the Lees 
were aristocratic in the finest sense of a much 
abused word, they were none the less democratic 
in the good American sense, — constituting what 
Jefferson calls those of the ' aristoi, ' the class 
to which he looked for government of this great 
land of ours. And since the peculiar civiliza- 
tion of the South served to develop this class 
to an extent probably seen nowhere else in the 
world, it is small wonder that the South domi- 
nated the country until the very verge of the 
war between the States, and came perilously 
near winning in that unequal contest.

the Revolution. It is not so generally known 
that General Henry liee was buried at Dun- 
geness, en Cumberland Island, Georgia, where 
he died at the house of General Nathanael 
Greene on his return from the West Indies in 
1818. His more distinguished son first visited 
the spot, as his letter records, in January, 1862, 
when the war was at its height. Nor is it gen- 
erally known that General Lee married, in Mary 
Custis, the great-granddaughter of the widow 
Custis who is endeared to Americans as Martha 
Washington. General L«e's letters to his dearly 
beloved wife form the foundation of this pleas- 
ant volume, appropriately bound in Confeder- 
ate grey and illustrated with four photogravure 
portraits of the great leader. These letters to 
the wife are supplemented chiefly by the remin- 
iscences of the son who, being of the same name, 
is distinguished as Captain Lee. Numerous 
other authentic sources are drawn upon, but it 
is from these two that the most distinct impres- 
sions are received. They disclose at once that 
fineness of nature which ensures respect and 
that profound sympathy with humankind which 
begets affection. No figure could be more manly 
than that presented by General Lee to his imme- 
diate family. 

Captain Lee's reminiscences begin with the 
return of his father from the war with Mexico, 
in which no small share of military glory came 
to him. His residence at West Point, while 
Superintendent of the Military Academy there, 
is quite clear in his mind. The breaking out of 
the war between the States is even more clearly 
recalled, and some vivid impressions thereof 
are here set down. Concerning General Lee's 
attitude at the time, a letter from him to Rev- 
erdy Johnson establishes beyond question the 
fact that Lee was unofficially tendered the com- 
mand of the armies of the United States before 
his resignation as Colonel of the First Cavalry. 
No doubt Captain Lee reflects his father's atti- 
tude in holding to the constitutionality of seces- 
sion, and the consequent lack of justification in 
the armed invasion of Virginia which induced 
General Lee to take up arms in defense of his 
State, finally succeeding to the chief conmiand 
of the Confederate forces. 

Possibly no episode in the book seems more 
characteristic of everyone concerned than Cap- 
tain Lee's account of his own enlistment in the 
Southern army. The youth, then a student in 
the L^nirersity of Virginia, was fretting because 
he had not been allowed to don a uniform at the 
beginning of hostilities; but his father 
restrained him until the Spring of 1863, when 
he gave his consent that he should enter the 
artillery as a private soldier, sending for him 
and superintending his equipment himself. This 
interesting episode receives the following com- 
ment: 



* It was characteristic of his consideration for 
others, and the unselfishness of his nature, that at 
this time, when weighed down, harrassed, and bur- 
dened by the cares incident to bringing the 
untrained forces of the Confederacy into the field, 
and preparing them for a struggle the seriousness 
of which he knew better than anyone, he should 
give his time and attention to the minute details 
of fitting out his youngest son as a private soldier. 
I think it worthy of note that the son of the com- 
manding general enlisting as a private in his army 
was not thought to be anything remarkable or 
unusual. Neither my mother, my family, my 
friends, nor myself, expected any other course; and 
I do not suppose it ever occurred to my father to 
think of giving me an office, which he could easily 
have done. I know it never occurred to me, nor 
did I ever hear, at that time or afterwards, from 
anyone, that I might have been entitled to better 
rank than that of a private because of my father's 
prominence in Virginia and in the Confederacy. 
With the good advice to be obedient to all author- 
ity, to do my duty in everything, great or small, 
he bade me good-bye, and sent me off to the Valley 
of Virginia, where the command in which I was 
about to enlist were serving under " Stonewall 
Jackson." ' 

Nor did the young man obtain his commission 
until after he had repeatedly demonstrated his 
fitness for it by good conduct under fire. Three 
times he came under his father's personal atten- 
tion as a private soldier, and the last of the 
three is certainly worth setting dovm as illus- 
trative of several things in the bringing up of 
the Lee family in the two generations involved. 
Captain Lee recounts the incident as follows : 

' On that occasion [the battle of Sharpsburg] our 
battery had been severely handled, losing many men 
and horses. Having three guns disabled, we were 
ordered to withdraw; and while moving back we 
passed General Lee and several of his staff, grouped 
on a little knoll near the road. Having no definite 
orders where to go, our captain, seeing the com- 
manding general, halted us and rode over to get 
some instructions. Some others and myself went 
along to see and hear. General Lee was dismounted, 
with some of his staff around him, a courier hold- 
ing his horse. Captain Poague, commanding our 
battery, the Eockbridge Artillery, saluted, reported 
our condition, and asked for instructions. The 
General, listening patiently, looked at us, — his eyes 
passing over me without any sign of recognition, — 
and then ordered Captain Poague to take the most 
serviceable horses and men, man the uninjured gun, 
send the disabled part of his command back to 
refit, and report to the front for duty. As Poague 
turned to go, I went up to speak to my father. 
When he found out who I was, he congratulated 
me on being well and unhurt. I then said: 

' " General, are you going to send us in again?" 

* " Yes, my son," he replied, with a smile; " you 
all must do what you can to help drive these people 
back." ' 

This incident, which certainly borders on the 
heroic, is noted in a letter from General Lee 
to Mrs. Lee soon after, in which he says, ' I have 
not laid eyes on Eob since I saw him in the 
battle of Sharpsburg, — going in with a single 
gun of his for the second time, after his com- 
pany had been withdrawn in consequence of 
three of its guns having been disabled. '

By one of the familiar paradoxes of history, 
•General Lee's very prominence kept him from 
a free expression of opinion, certainly from 
3)ublic expressions of opinion on important 
•questions. It is the great value of this book 
that it contains many of his private opinions on 
such topics, and many interesting estimates of 
men and events. Expressions by him regard- 
ing three of the men with whom he was most 
intimately connected are reproduced as fol- 
lows: 

* The joy of our victory at Chancellorsville was 
•saddened by the death of " Stonewall " Jackson. 
His loss was the heaviest blow the Army of North- 
ern Virginia ever sustained. To Jackson's note tell- 
ing hira that he was wounded, my father replied: " I 
■cannot express my regret at the occurrence. Could 
I have directed events, I should have chosen for the 
good of the country to have been disabled in your 
stead. I congratulate you on the victory, which is 
due to your skill and energy." Jackson said, when 
this was read to him, "Better that ten Jacksons 
should fall than one Lee." Afterward, when it 
was reported that Jackson was doing well, General 
Lee playfully sent him word, "You are better off 
than I am, for while you have only lost your left, 
I have lost my right arm." Then, hearing he was 
worse, he said, " Tell him that I am praying for 
liim as I believe I have never prayed for myself. ' ' ' 

* "I was sitting on my horse very near to Gen- 
•eral Lee," writes Captain W. Gordon McCabe to 
Oaptain Lee, "when a courier galloped up with 
the despatch announcing that General J. E. B. 
Stuart had been mortally wounded and was dying. 
General Lee was evidently greatly affected, and 
«aid slowly, as he folded up the despatch, ' ' General 
■Stuart has been mortally wounded: a most valuable 
and able officer." Then, after a moment, he added 
in a voice of deep feeling, "He never brought me 
a piece of false iuf ormation, " — turned and looked 
away. What praise dearer to a soldier's heart 
■could fall from the lips of the commanding general 
"touching his Chief of Cavalry! ' 

' General Lee was asked after the war, by a lady, 
"his opinion of the position and part Mr. [JeffersonJ 
Davis had taken and acted during the war. He 
replied: "If my opinion is worth anything, you 
«an always say that few people could have done 
better than Mr. Davis. I knew of none that could 
liave done as well." ' 

Regarding the most momentous of all Gen- 
•eral Lee's combats, he himself wrote to an 
inquiring historian as follows: 

*As to the battle of Gettysburg, I must again 
refer you to the official accounts. Its loss was occa- 
sioned by a combination of circumstances. It was 
commenced in the absence of correct intelligence. 
It was continued in the effort to overcome the diffi- 
•culties by which we were surrounded, and it would 
Tiave been gained could one determined and united 
T)low have been delivered by our whole line. As 
it was, victory trembled in the balance for three 
days, and the battle resulted in the infliction of as 
•great an amount of injury as was received, and in 
frustrating the Federal campaign for the season.' 

A pleasant anecdote relating to the meeting 
of the two Gettysburg commanders is recorded, 
Lee and Meade having been friends and com- 
rades in the ' old ' army, before the war. The 
Confederate said, 'Meade, years are telling on 



you ; your hair is getting quite grey. ' ' Ah, 
General Lee, ' replied Meade promptly, ' it is 
not the work of years; you are responsible for 
my grey hairs. ' Through Mr. Cazenove Lee, 
Captain Lee is able to record a conversation 
between Cassius Lee and his cousin-german. 
General Lee, in July, 1870. A portion, at least, 
of this weighty exchange of opinion must be set 
down, for all of it has historic value. In the 
words of Mr. Cazenove Lee, General Lee 
thought that 

'If Jackson had been at Gettysburg they would 
have gained a victory; " for," said he, " Jackson 
would have held the heights which Ewell took the 
first day." He said that Ewell was a fine officer, 
but would never take the responsibility of exceed- 
ing his orders, and having been ordered to Gettys- 
burg, he would not go farther and hold the heights 
beyond the town. I asked him which of the Federal 
generals he considered the greatest, and he an- 
swered, most emphatically, "McClellan by all 
odds." He was asked why he did not come to 
Washington after the second Manassas. "Because," 
he replied, "my men had nothing to eat." ' 

It is worthy of note that less than half the 
volume is devoted to General Lee in war-time, 
the greater part of it describing his conduct 
after Appomattox, especially in relation to his 
position as President of Washington College. 
Whether in peace or war, defeat or victory, the 
well-drawn portrait in this book shows a man 
truly great, one of the first of all Americans.

PARTISAN History.* 



The history of a party, if it is to be of any 
permanent value, should be written by one who 
has the clear vision of a historian and the calm 
judgment of a philosopher, rather than the 
enthusiasm of an advocate. While he who 
writes it should set down naught in malice, he 
should likewise naught extenuate. He should, 
above all things, grasp the principle or prin- 
ciples differentiating the subject of his study 
from all opposing parties. Back of this, he 
should understand in its fulness the fact that 
the party, like the Sabbath, was made for man, 
and not man for the party. The origin of the 
party should be carefully sought in the ante- 
cedent history of the earlier parties which it 
displaced or absorbed. Its career should be 
traced with some recognition of the truth that 
the opinions and principles of a party are by no 
means the same when in power as when in oppo- 
sition; that success inevitably breeds insolence, 
and that affliction is good for the soul of parties

as well as of individuals. The fact that, in the 
main, half the nation supports some other party 
than the one in power should bring to mind the 
sanity of the people, which the greatest of 
Republicans so thoroughly respected, and should 
suggest the thought that where there are two 
great parties both may stand for some great 
principle, and that in the balance aiud poise of 
continuous readjustment the promise of safety 
lies. 

The writer of the book now under considera- 
tion does not meet these conditions; indeed, 
this is perhaps not to be expected in a work 
introduced by the three highest in rank and 
influence of the exponents of Republican policy. 
The work might better have been entitled, ' His- 
tory of the United States during the Suprem- 
acy of the Republican Party.' It is an interest- 
ing narration of superficial events: connection 
is rarely suggested. One looks in vain for an 
explanation of the genetic connection of the 
Republican party with the older Whigs or Fed- 
eralists. He would however hardly expect to be 
correctly informed by one who writes: *The 
name National Republican was retained until 
the campaign of 1832, when the party became 
known as the Anti-Mason party, afterwards the 
Whigs, ' or who makes of the ' personal rule ' 
of Andrew Jackson a secession from the Repub- 
lican party of Jefferson, giving rise to the 
Democratic party. The fundamental distinc- 
tion between the two great parties of our 
national history does not appear in the present 
narrative. Our attention is so restricted to the 
heralding of nominating conventions and plat- 
forms, that we learn nothing of the growth and 
change of public opinion. We are so occupied 
with the machinery of party that we almost for- 
get to ask for the motive-power back of the 
machinery. The critical spirit of the author i-i 
indicated by one of the sub- titles to the conclud- 
ing chapter, ' The Same Grand Old Party,' and 
by the following sentence from that chapter: 
* The Republican party, in its policies, its legis- 
lation, and its administration of the laws made 
by its chosen legislators, has from the beginning 
never faltered, never thought of retreat, and 
has never left a work till it was finished prop- 
erly. ' After reading this, one is prepared for 
a complete justification of the deeds of Repub- 
lican administrations and Congress from 1861 
to the present day ; and the only partial excep- 
tion to such a justification is found when the 
tariff of 1883 is reached. The author then says : 
' There is no criticism to be made upon the 
attempt of the Republican party to revise the 
Tariff laws in 1882 and 1883. It is only chari- 
table to say that they were not equal to the occa- 
sion. ' The prosperity which has come to the 
country since the passage of the Dingley tariff 
act is most naively accredited to that legisla- 



tion as a sufficient and adequate cause, with 
never a suspicion that the question of a stable- 
standard was what the country went to the polls- 
for with a unanimity that almost submerged 
the Republican party under a rush of independ- 
ent voters. 

One would look to see some adequate discus- 
sion of the principlesi involved in the Recon- 
struction of the South after the war, — such a 
discussion as Mr. McCall gives in his admirable- 
biography of Thaddeus Stevens, — in a two- 
volume history of the party of Reconstruction. 
Instead, we find the subject dismissed in a few 
pages, with the final word, ' It is the generally 
accepted opinion, thirty years later, that they 
not only did the best they could, but did their- 
work well and with the purest of motives. ' In 
spite of this ipse dixit, many are still claiming 
that not only purity of motive, but practical 
wisdom is necessary to statesmanship, and are 
ready to argue with that expert authority on 
this subject, Ex-Governor Chamberlain, that 
Reconstruction was a dismal failure. That 
interesting chapter in Reconstruction history — 
the conflicting views of Mr. Lincoln and Con- 
gress — is barely indicated. The financing of 
the war period, with its heritage of woe to the 
next generation in fiat money, is covered by the 
statement, ' It is enough to say that in the very 
darkest hour the finances of the country, its 
methods of taxation, the coins and credits and^ 
payments, were as near perfect as human wis- 
dom could devise. ' Curiously enough, Secre- 
tary Chase did not think so! The evil condi- 
tions that confronted Mr. Cleveland in 1893, 
and led to the disastrous industrial period that 
followed, conditions largely due to the silver 
legislation of a Republican Congress summed' 
up in the Sherman Act, to the extravagance of 
a Republican administration, and to the incom- 
petency of a Republican Secretary of the Treas- 
ury, are all laid to the charge of the administra- 
tion that inherited them. When a reluctant 
Congress, impelled at length by public distress 
and Mr. Cleveland's importunity, passed the 
repeal act of 1893, which paved the way for the- 
good times that came in with Mr. McKinley,. 
the candid chronicler can only concede: *Mr. 
Cleveland and his advisers were astute enough 
to see that some attempt must be made to allay 
the apprehension of the business community; 
consequently an extra session was called, result- 
ing in the repeal. ' It is ludicrous to find Presi- 
dent Cleveland condemned for one of the best 
things he consistently and persistently did — ^the- 
vetoing of vicious pension legislation. It is 
amusing also to read the diatribe concerning 
the '^ Mugwump,' which fills so many pages of 
the last chapter. Not even the discovery that 
Mr. McKinley was chosen President in 189&- 
by the vote of the independent can abate the

contempt which this dyed-in-the-wool Eepub- 
lican visits upon the man who has convictions 
and dares to give practical expression to them. 

The author states that the last Whig conven- 
tion was held in 1852, although he records the 
proceedings of a later one. He does not know 
why President Jackson allowed Troup and 
Georgia nullifiers to defy the decree of his 
special enemy John Marshall, while enforcing 
the law against Calhoun and South Carolina, 
in which case Jackson was defied. He dis- 
parages Mr. Seward's ' hig'her law ' statement, 
in which every true Republican should glory, 
by finding a precedent for it in Amos Kendall's 
setting the local community above the higher 
law, and so finding a sanction for his violation 
of the mails; citing also a still earlier prece- 
dent in the utterance of a Missouri judge, plac- 
ing mob action above the law of the land. 

In closing this well-written and. plausible 
campaign document, the historian recurs to the 
words of the great classical writer Bentley on 
perusing a copy of Pope's Iliad : ' A very pretty 
poem, Mr, Pope, but not Homer. ' Those who 
love the Republican party for what it has done 
of righteousness, despite its sins and its sinners, 
will look still to see its history portrayed in 
true colors. jo^ij^ j^ Halsey. 



Through the Eyes of a Boy.* 

Since Mr. Howells's delightful idyll of boy- 
hood, * A Boy's Town,' there has perhaps been 
no worthier companion volume than Mr. Bar- 
row's ' Farmington.' If one were born a boy, 
and has lived long enough to be able to look 
back and understand what it was to be young, 
and what his youth has meant to him ever since, 
he will find his real self again in these limpid 
pages. And if he be lucky enough to have 
begun life in the country, or in a village which 
was so small as to be almost the same thing, 
tucked in beside a millstream that divided two 
high hills, he will see with his waking eyes the 
places and the people that come to him in 
dreams, — dreams that are perhaps the best part 
of his life. 

In Farmington there was a church, a district 
school, a square, a burying-ground, and a mill. 
In the church, long hours of torture were spent 
by restless urchins, who were in great awe of 
the minister, and were surprised when they dis- 
covered later that he was a real man like others 
whom they knew. In the school-house, the little 
ruffians made life wretched for the teacher, and 
had as much fun and wasted as little time over 
their studies as was possible for them to do.

vania Village. By Clarence S. Darrow. Chicago: A. C. 
McClurg & Co. 



They read the highly moral tales of the old 
readers, they declaimed the threadbare old ora- 
tions, and they governed themselves and each 
other according to the primal code of morals 
known to boys for many generations. In the 
village square they played the games suggested 
by the changing year; and along the stream, 
in the woods, fields, and over the hills, they 
had the endless varieties of fun and learned 
the thousand things which go to form the 
mind and character of country-bred children. 
Through the burying-ground they went only 
when they could prove the safety that lies in 
numbers, and when the sun shone on the tomb- 
stones which figured in their plan of life like 
sentient things. It is, however, when speaking 
of the village mill, which was the boy's homei 
as well, that Mr, Darrow is at his best. He has 
touched the simple life that flowed through and 
around it with a touch so wistful and so tender 
that the reader can only guess if there was a 
smile on his lips as he wrote, or if they were 
pressed together to keep back the tears. 

Not much character-drawing is attempted in 
this little book; and in this reserve Mr. Darrow 
shows much wisdom. People are not often 
clearly diiferentiated by the minds of children, 
who accept their social surroundings with as 
little question as they do their physical environ- 
ment. A few figures stand out with boldness, 
however, and if they are drawn with simple 
lines, the lines have a vigor and directness that 
give them quite enough of both light and shade. 
The well-known ne'er-do-weel who lives in every 
village in every land has rarely been better 
drawn than in the light sketch of ' Ferman 
Henry,' whose counterpart may be found in 
*Sam Lawson' in Mrs. Stowe's memorable ' Old 
Town Folks.' ' Aunt Mary ' is another auld 
acquaintance whom one is not likely to for- 
get, — the woman who lived in bondage to a 
heartless idol called Neatness, whose cult she 
ever preached to an unheeding generation. 
' Squire Allen,' the ' great man of the village,' 
was so very great that it was quite inconceivable 
how so small a place could hold him; and the 
loungers and scandal-mongers of the black- 
smith's and shoemaker's shops, — we have seen 
them all before. 

The crowning glory of the book is the portrait 
of the boy's father, — the gentle, honest, un- 
worldly old miller, who put aside the fervid 
longings of his own spirit in order that he 
might feed and clothe the children who thronged 
about his hearth; who, loving honor, loving 
integrity, loving justice, above all else loved 
learning, in the beautiful old sense of the word. 
One rarely hears it so used in these hurried 
times, and perhaps it is the mission of the little 
book to open the eyes of a restless later day 
to the old and deep well-spring of contentment

that lies behind it. Here is a bit of this filial 
and tender portrait : 

'Above the little porch that shelters the front 
door is my father's study window. I look in and 
see him sitting at his desk with his shaded lamp; 
before him is his everlasting book, and his pale 
face and long white hair bend over the infatuating 
pages with all the confidence and trust of a little 
child. For a simple child he always was, from the 
time when he first saw the light until his friends 
and comrades lowered him into the sandy loam of 
the old churchyard. I see him through the little 
panes of glass, as he bends above the book. The 
chapter is finished and he wakens from his reverie 
into the world in which he lives and works; he takes 
off his iron-framed spectacles, lays down his book, 
comes downstairs and calls me away from my com- 
panions with the old story that it is time to come 
into the house and get my lessons. For the hun- 
dredth time I protest that I want to play, — to 
finish my unending game; and again he tells me 
no, that John Stuart Mill began studying Greek 
when he was only three years old. And with heavy 
heart and muttered imprecations on John Stuart 
Mill, I am taken away from my companions and my 
play, and set down beside my father with my book. 
I can feel even now my sorrow and despair, as 1 
leave my playmates and turn the stupid leaves. But 
I would give all that I possess to-day to hear my 
father say again, as in that far-off time, "John 
Stuart Mill began studying Greek when he was only 
three years old." ' 

' Farmington ' is not a book to be taken from 
the public library, or even to be borrowed from 
an obliging friend. It is not a book for the 
limited express, or the smoking-room of an 
inn. It is a book to own, — to read by the win- 
ter's fire, and re-read under a summer tree; a 
book to be kept on the shelf where the oldest 
favorites live. It is a book for boys, for women, 
— ' but above all, it is a book for men who have 
once been boys. s^jj^ Andrew Shafee. 



Social, Theory akd Practice.* 



The eminent French publicist and sociologist, 
Gabriel Tarde, in his work on ' The Laws of 
Imitation ' has described, with wealth of learn- 
ing, the mechanism by which beliefs and desires 
are transmitted, conveyed, and improved. 
Unquestionably, imitation is a universal phe- 
nomenon of human life. But the theory leaves

unexplained the real contents of belief and 
desires, and it places no valuation upon them, 
lends no standards to test them. Imitation is 
even made the source of invention. Is this final 
and adequate? Strictly speaking, imitation is 
likeness, repetition; while invention signifies a 
novelty. Imitation is a fact which explains 
many facts, but it is itself a phenomenon to be 
explained. Professors Baldwin, Cooley, and 
other psychologists, have seen the defect and 
contributed further considerations; but the 
problem is not yet solved. Simply to give abun- 
dant illustrations of the copying process does 
not diminish our need of further insight into 
the exact reasons why the child frowns when its 
mother frowns, or why a savage prince struts 
in the silk hat of a European, with little else in 
the way of clothing. 

In reading Tarde's argument, one may be 
persuaded to think imitation will explain every- 
thing ; but the author himself is not under this 
illusion, and gives abundant facts to correct it 
Imitation implies a common psychical nature, 
and must not be pressed too far. * Every new

ple, the Esquimaux may wonder at and admire 
the dress of men and women from Italy, but 
they will not copy them. Imitation is influen- 
tial, but it must not require the Arctic nations 
to give up blubber and live on rice. French 
wine was added to beer in England, but most 
Englishmen prefer beer. 

Glimpses of H. de Vries' mutation theory 
may be seen in this work, especially in connec- 
tion with the rise of invention. Novelties 
do not arise by slow gradations alone, but last- 
ing institutions spring up suddenly. Thus 
(p. 267) : 'In India, where in the depths of 
Hindooism the birth of some very low form of 
religion is actually an everyday occurrence, 
Lyell informs us that their starting-point lies 
in the preaching of some exalted reformer, of 
some ascetic or celibate.' 

Tarde evidently wrote about America in^ a 
friendly spirit, so that the following bit of mis- 
information must illustrate the danger of sec- 
ond-hand reports of travellers : 

'From one end to the other of the United States, 
from top to bottom, throughout all classes, even 
among good-looking women (and there is certainly 
no more striking example of the power of imitation 
than this), we find the repugnant habit of tobacco- 
chewing, — a fact that explains the universal pres- 
ence of the spittoon, the most indispensable piece of 
furniture in America. Is this a habit that is made 
necessary by the exigencies of race and climate? 
Not at all; it is another case of fashion and custom.' 

If all M. Tarde's illustrations were of this kind 
his book would not carry conviction very far.

- The translation here noticed is quite well 
done, from the second edition (1895), the first 
French edition having appeared in 1890. The 
biographical introduction by Professor Giddings 
gives a brief and clear survey of the literary 
career of the author, who has died since this 
translation appeared. 

One must be a bold spirit to venture with 
Mr. Wallis on the vast scheme of 'An Exam- 
ination of Society.' If we follow the author, we 
shall traverse the entire course of human history 
from primitive savagery to the most recent and 
highest achievements of science anid art. The 
range of topics and the list of authorities cited 
are enough to awe the most universal and ver- 
satile of scholars. Hebrew, Greek, Roman, 
medigeval and modern civilizations, are passed 
under review to illustrate a theory of ' social 
cleavage.' Where the whole argument comes 
to the practical i&sue, in the last chapter, we 
find that we have left in our critical crucible 
the author's own panacea of heavy taxation — 
some would say confiscation — of land values ; 
and there is an ingenious line of evidence to 
prove that the inventor of this theory has not 
plagiarized from Henry George or the social- 
ists. 

The author of ' The Socialization of Human- 
ity ' is serious, if we can judge by style and con- 
tent of the book. He is possessed by the philo- 
sophical craving for unification of experience. 
He hopes to reach a ' complete orientation of 
the race and the establishment of the principles 
which will lead to the democratization and 
socialization of humanity.' Religion is the 
supreme interest of humanity, and that because 
the object of religion is humanity itself. Sin 
is ignorance. The salvation of the race is 
science, — organized and diffused knowledge of 
the conditions of universal well-being. There 
are many quotations from Comte, and even the 
allusions to Spencer do not show that his pro- 
test against the Positivist deposition of religion 
has been heeded. ' Instead of God read human- 
ity. The all-seeing eye is conscience; the all- 
feeling heart is sympathy, duty.' We have a 
misleading reference to Kant (p. 90) ; his 
destructive criticism of theology is mentioned, 
but nothing is said of his constructive argu- 
ment. This is the author's idea of a university : 
' Every teacher in a university struggles with 
every other teacher to see which one can worry 
the student most with dry, hard tasks, exasper- 
ating examinations, brain-racking quizzes; that 
teacher being deemed the best who can produce 
the most dismay, despair, and disaster' (p. 
183). One must feel relieved after expelling 
that kind of matter from his consciousness! 
There is much that is true and nobly said, albeit 
with wearisome repetition, in this volume. 
Those who have not felt the rational difficulties 



of this form of crude monism may regard it as 
final. But those who have studied Kant, Hegel, 
Green, Pfleiderer, and Tiel, as well as Comte 
and Spencer, M'ill be likely to conclude that 
there are some problems still left in philosophy 
of which this writer has not even had a glimpse. 
But this brief paragraph is not the place for a 
counter-argument or for a plea for the detested 
idealism. 

Mr. Coleman's book on ' Social Ethics ' has 
for its sub-title ' An Introduction to the Nature 
and Ethics of the State.' It is, in fact, a plea 
for some sort of a theocracy. The book is writ- 
ten to prove that our government ought to con- 
fess the creed of Christianity. The author evi- 
dently does not recall the New England trial 
of his method, and the resulting hypocrisy, per- 
secution, and oppression of dissenters. He 
seems never to have read or duly considered the 
analysis of Roger Williams, or the reasons 
which led the religious founders of our republic 
and authors of our Constitution to avoid pre- 
cisely the mischief which this writer's scheme 
would bring upon us. 

Socialism has many shrewd methods of secur- 
ing a hearing, and one of these is omitting the 
label and signature. In Mrs. Charlotte Perkins 
Oilman's ' Human Work,' as in Mr. Veblen's 
keen and caustic * Theory of the Leisure 
Classes,' we have a recommendation of the med- 
icine in the guise of a story ; only here we have 
a highly passionate and at times dramatic plea, 
whereas in Veblen we have only the frosty star- 
light of pure science. The feminine advocate 
has a theory of work which urges that if society 
wants production it must first feed its members, 
provide them all abundantly with comfort and 
education, and then they will enjoy their tasks 
and sing even at ditch-digging. As for mem- 
bers of the parasitic group called ' Society,' our 
author has little praise. 

'Such women play the game we call "Society," 
whose trivial performances are celebrated so 
respectfully in our newspapers in their record of 
dinners and dresses and dances, as if what these 
people ate, or what they wore, or how they hopped 
about, was of any earthly importance. . . . They 
even designate their pitiful amusements as "social 
functions," a misnomer as consummately absurd as 
"Christian Science." . . . For a lot of richly 
caparisoned human animals to get together and eat, 
or embrace one another and caper about to the 
sound of music, has no more relation to a social 
function than St. Vitus' dance has to chopping 
wood. A disease is not a function.' 

Yet Mrs. Oilman's book is a serious one, and 
contains, along with much crude expression of 
raw materials of systematic thinking, many 
powerful and valid arguments for the socializa- 
tion of production. The modem world is going 
that way much more rapidly than some people 
like to believe ; and those who detest the visions 
of Socialism most of all, the ' captains of indus-

THE DIAL,

try/ are those who seem to do more to push 
and pull society in the direction of unified pro- 
duction and social control than all the inspired 
prophets of the ' proletariate.' 

Mr. C. S. Loch has brought together a num- 
ber of valuable papers relating to charity work 
•of the modern type, which represent the more 
recent tendencies in this sphere. The motto on 
the title-page is significant : ' If citizens be 
friends, they have no need of justice; but, 
though they be just, they need friendship or 
love also; indeed, the completest realization of 
justice seems to be the realization of friendship 
or love also.' Social science may be compared 
to the work of the ' assembler ' in a watch fac- 
tory. His function is to arrange the various 
parts so that they will finally mark the time, — 
the duty of a watch. All kinds of data, while 
isolated, minister little if at all to human wel- 
fare; but marshalled in subordination to 
supreme social ends, they ameliorate man's 
estate. Thus, in this book the physicians advise 
wise action in respect to dispensaries and the 
rearing of children, the work of a hospital 
-almoner, charitable action in phthisical cases; 
while other persons, with experience in adminis- 
tration, give the results of experiments with 
-agricultural colonies, labor bureaus, industrial 
partnerships, and poor-laws. The essays fur- 
nish valuable contributions to the science of 
■charity. 

Mr. Peter Eoberts, the author of ' Anthracite 
•Coal Communities,' has already described the 
more strictly economic aspects of the life of 
miners in ^The Anthracite Coal Industry' 
(1901) ; and in the present volume he sets 
"before us the facts relative to the social and 
moral life of the anthracite mine employers. 
This study of the demography and culture of 
this interesting people is sane, earnest, idealistic. 
The writer has lived near the people he de- 
scribes; and while he lays bare the tragic phe- 
nomena of their narrow and animalistic exist- 
ence, he also reveals the promises of a better 
to-morrow manifested in occasional expressions 
of aesthetic, ethical, and religious asp'iration. 
The student of educational method will here 
confront many neglected factors in the social 
•conditions of workingmen which demand im- 
provements in the curriculum of public schools. 
A local study, intensive rather than wide, and 
■dealing with a fairly homogeneous population 
all dependent on a single industry, has far more 
value than one which rests on statistics whose 
averages are meaningless or misleading because 
they cover too large an area and have too many 
conflicting facts which cancel each other. Yet 
the universal elements of human nature and 
need are not obscure, for the writer ' sees all 
great things in the small.' In dealing with 
..this people, we wish to loiow the nature of the 



territory in which they live, the nationalities 
represented, the facts about births and deaths, 
the furniture of the homes, the food and amuse- 
ments, the treatment of children by parents, 
the schoolhouses, teachers, and pupils, school 
attendance, the activity of the churches, the 
saloon, the savings banks, the criminals, pauper- 
ism and charity, and politics. The author does 
not rest with description; he has a remedy for 
the evils and a working method of ameliora- 
tion; and he arranges his argument in a way 
which should make an impression on all patri- 
otic citizens who have not lost faith in the 
regenerating power of justice, reason, and edu- 
cation. Charles E. Henderson.

Newman as The casual reader of Newman, 

writer and whose attention is usually con- 

ecciesiaatic. ^^q^ ^q the * Apologia ' and the 

* Idea of a University,' is almost certain to be 
repelled. He made, from the point of view of 
rational men, 'the great refusal'; he said to the 
tides of intellect, ' No farther.' He is a signal 
example of the mind of the ecclesiastic, that 
sternly limited, severe, often delicate instrument 
which deals with idealities as if they were facts, 
and for that reason, despite its humanitarian 
ends, frequently seems wanting in genuine human- 
ity, in a warm-blooded relation to men as they 
are. He was, moreover, with his Hebrew and 
Huguenot blood, pre-committed to Roman legal- 
ism and sacramentalism, to an institution rather 
than to a philosophy, to mechanism rather than 
to life. This, we think, does not overstate the 
grounds of the casual reader's repulsion from 
Newman. Such a repulsion, Dr. Barry's book on 
Newman, published in the * Literary Lives ' series 
(Scribners), should do somewhat to remove. 
Newman was perfectly aware — no rationalist 
more so — that dogma is the merest adumbration 
of theological truth; so perfectly aware of this 
that he has been charged with essential skepti- 
cism. On the other hand, being a practical man 
and not a metaphysician, he made the funda- 
mental act of faith in the validity of his own 
mental processes that we are all obliged to make. 
His ' illative sense ' convinced him of spiritual 
truth,— gave him, in other words, * certitude.' 

* Proof ' was not an exclusively logical process, 
but * the limit of converging probabilities. ' Could 
moderation go further? The method was sound; 
that it should have led him to Rome is no miracle. 
Even Huxley thought it led either to Rome or to 
Agnosticism. There is no more disputing about 
the judgments of the ' illative sense ' than about 
those of taste. He had exclaimed, in his illness 
of 1833, ' I shall not die, for I have not sinned 
against light.' To the end, this was true. New- 
man's aloofness from the concerns of ordinary 
men is harder to defend. He was, no doubt, what 
Dr. Barry calls him, the ' perfect friend.' His 
personal charm was Avell-nigh irresistible. He

knew the heart of man as the great novelist knows 
it. Yet there are many passages in the sermons, 
for example, whose sternness is unrelieved by any 
touch of human pity. ' Fierceness ' he thinks a 
not undesirable quality of religion as compared 
with the lukewarmness he deprecated. Such a 
tone is strange and unwelcome in the ears even 
of good men who know and love their kind. It 
sounds strangely from a son of the Church which, 
after all, faces the moral facts of human nature 
as Protestantism has never done. * Fierceness,' 
it seems to us, is a quality appropriate to no 
human institution and to no human interpreta- 
tion of a divine one. Dr. Barry properly lays 
much stress upon Newman's sense of his- 
toric continuity, upon his application of the 
theory of Evolution in his doctrine of develop- 
ment, and upon the philosophical bearings of his 
* implicit reason.' That * his conclusions, as a 
whole, are akin to Schopenhauer's' is a statement 
that will prove illuminating to the casual reader. 
The fact is that while the volume is professedly 
devoted to Newman as an English prose classic, 
the chapters on ' The Logic of Belief ' and * New- 
man 's Place in History ' are far and away the 
most interesting. So true is it that Newman, even 
as the supreme master of English prose, yields in 
interest to Newman the man. Dr. Barry's book is 
agreeably written. At times it is perhaps a shade 
fanciful or florid in style, but in tone it is emi- 
nently moderate and reasonable. But why should 
the author of a ' literary life ' misquote Milton 
(p. 140) ? 

The pains and The humor and pathos, the sweet 
pleasures of gratifications and the bitter disap- 

offlce-seeking. pointments of political life, are 
agreeably pvortrayed with pen and pencil and 
camera in Mr. Joseph Bucklin Bishop's ' Our 
Political Drama, ' published by the Scott-Thaw Co. 
Three magazine articles on national conventions, 
presidential inaugurations, and early political 
caricature in America, form the basis of this 
attractive volume, which, without containing any- 
thing of great novelty or importance, brings 
together from such sources as Greeley's and 
Weed's and Colonel McClure's political reminis- 
cences many readable items concerning public 
men and public events. The parallelism in the 
careei-s of Clay, Webster, and Blaine, each of 
whom had the presidential bee persistently buzz- 
ing in his bonnet, is well brought out. Clay, 
whose immortal declaration that he would rather 
be right than be president is more familiar than 
its authorship, made at least one other pithy ut- 
terance, when, disappointed a third time in the 
hope of his life, he declared his inability to sup- 
port the successful candidate (Taylor) who 
had refused him his support four years 
previously. * Magnanimity is a noble virtue,' 
said Clay, * and I have always endeavored 
to practice it; but it has its limits, and 
the line of demarcation between it and 
meanness is not always discernible. ' The popular 
myth about Jefferson's democratic simplicity in 
riding on horseback and unattended to his inaug- 
uration, hitching his animal to the palings and 



Avalking alone into the Senate chamber to take 
the oath of office, is pretty effectually exploded 
by the author, who has collected a number of 
interesting incidents relating to that and other 
presidential inaugurations. In dealing with the 
subject of caricature, he assigns 1832 as the date 
when this engine of political warfare was first 
employed in America. It seems very unsafe to 
assert that grotesque or offensive drawings had 
never before been used in the heat of a pre-elec- 
tion campaign, even though these interesting 
objects of art may be no longer extant. Lincoln- 
iana naturally take a prominent place in Mr. Bish- 
op 's book; but it is somewhat surprising that he 
should choose to relate in full, from Greeley's 
* Recollections,' the old Fox River anecdote. The 
caricatures of Lincoln, reproduced with other 
similar cartoons, are startling in their hideous 
coarseness, and make strikingly evident how 
greatly our cartoonists have improved, both in 
taste and skill, since the early sixties. That the 
work under review is especially timely at this 
political season is of course apparent. 

A parson friend like Ms great adversary Napoleon, 
of the Duke the Duke of Wellington is being 

of Wellington. made the subject of many essays, 
sketches, and biographies. The latest in this kind 
is a volmne entitled * Reminiscences of the Duke 
of Wellington ' (imported by Scribner), written 
by the late Rev. G. R. Gleig, and published by his 
daughter sixteen years after his death. Mr. 
Gleig 's long life of ninety-two years (1796-18SS) 
was a busy and honorable one. As a youth of 
sixteen he volunteered in a regiment on its way 
to take part in the Peninsular campaign, where he 
learned to know the Duke (then Marquis) of 
Wellington. He had a taste of American service 
in the war of 1812, and wrote an account of the 
unhappy campaigns at Washington and New 
Orleans. A novel which he published in 1825, 
called ' The Subaltern,' based on the Peninsular 
war and dedicated to the Duke, brought him into 
favorable notice. At this time Mr. Gleig was 
rector of Ash in Kent, and a near neighbor to 
Walmer Castle, one of the Duke 's residences. He 
was on friendly and even intimate terms with the 
great man, whose confidence he shared, whose 
views, with some modifications, he followed, and 
to whose political fortunes he was steadily loyal. 
In 1862 he published a ' Life of Wellington,' to 
which the present volume of * Reminiscences ' 
must be regarded as an appendix. Leisurely put 
together in a serene old age, it is discursive and 
good-tempered; and we can smile indulgently at 
the complacency with which the veteran Tory 
parson-politician records the good advice which 
he gave his illustrious patron, and which at times 
the latter would have done well to follow. The 
Duke's three residences, Walmer Castle, Strath- 
fieldsaye, and Apsley House, are pleasantly 
described ; and there are sketches of various celeb- 
rities who at different times were the Duke's 
guests, — among them Talleyrand, the Duke of 
Cumberland, Sir Robert Peel, Charles Arbuthnot 
and his charming wife (who played the role of 
Egeria very successfully) the second Marquis of

Salisbury, and so on, down to such occasional 
guests as ' Billy ' Holmes and * Chin ' Grant. It 
cannot be said that these ' Reminiscences ' add 
very much to what was previously known of Well- 
ington, whose singularly simple character, like his 
' good gray head,' was known of all men; but 
they form an agreeable addendum to the more 
formal biographies. 

Recollections A reminiscence of Rossetti too 
of Rossetti, fragmentary to interest many out- 

by a Friend. ^[^q the cult is to be found in 

* Recollections of Dante Gabriel Rossetti and his 
Circle ' by the late Henry Treffry Dunn. The 
recollections are edited and annotated — rather 
too liberally, we think — by Mr. Gale Pedrick. 
Mr. W. M. Rossetti furnishes a brief preface 
sanctioning the book, and the publishers, Messrs. 
James Pott & Co., have provided several imique 
illustrations in photogravure. Readers of Mr. 
William Rossetti 's memoir of his brother will re- 
member that Mr. Dunn lived with Rossetti for 
many years in the capacity of companion, 
assistant, and disciple; so this little book 
represents a genuine and intimate contribu- 
tion to Rossetti 's biography. A large part 
of it is occupied with an account of Mr. 
Dunn's first visit to Rossetti. The painter, 
who was then a little under forty and at the 
height of his mental power, received the visitor 
cordially and showed him over the picturesque old 
Cheyne Row house — many rooms of which are 
described in detail in the ' Recollections '— and 
its ample groimds, where Rossetti kept his queer 
collection of pets. They should hardly be called 
pets, Mr. Dunn thinks. Rossetti was not fond of 
animals, nor did he know much about them. 

* It was simply a passion he had for collecting, 
just as he had for books, pictures, and china, 
which impelled him to convert his house into a 
sort of miniature South Kensington Museum and 
Zoo combined.* In his search for old blue Nan- 
kin, Rossetti had friendly rivals in Howell and 

* Jimmy ' Whistler, who had set the fashion. Mr. 
Dunn tells an amusing story of a dinner-party 
that Howell gave to celebrate a particularly 
glorious find, and of a return dinner at which 
Rossetti expected to be able to celebrate his 
possession of the same beautiful dish. Another 
interesting chapter deals with the experiments of 
the Rossetti circle in table-turning, spirit-rapping, 
and mesmerism. Rossetti 's latest biographer, Mr. 
Arthur Benson, has suggested that the poet's 
personality! has been shown to the world in too 
detailed a fashion and with too morbid a color- 
ing; this little volume, slight yet impressive, and 
dealing only with the best years of Rossetti 's 
life, will help to swing the balance toward a saner 
and more inspiring estimate of his complex char- 
acter. 

Bits from the Among the recent importations of 
Memoirs of Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. is 

a Marquise. < rphe French Noblesse of the 

Eighteenth Century,' translated by Mrs. Colqu- 
houn Grant from the Memoirs of the Marquise 
de Crequy. The translation is a spirited one, and 
Mrs. Grant has shown considerable skill in select- 



ing, from the seven volumes of the original, pas- 
sages which have a present interest and at the 
same time can be fitted one to another so as to- 
present the aspect of a continuous narrative. 
There is no doubt that the result is good reading. 
The Marquise (in the Memoirs at least) had a 
ready wit, of tenest barbed, and her reminiscences 
are full of quaint stories, clever bits of descrip- 
tion, and graphic accounts of the brilliant court 
circle in which she moved. She was a woman of 
strong opinions, as witness her intense dislike of 
Voltaire, Talleyrand, and the House of Orleans,, 
her serene contempt for the plebeian Benjamin 
Franklin, and her undying devotion to her church 
and her king. Naturally, the Memoirs abound in 
color and variety. For their absolute veracity 
there is not so much to be said. The Marquise 
did not write them herself, except possibly a 
little of the first volume, and since the person who 
completed the work — as he alleged, with her 
cooperation — was so careless as to mis-state and 
mis-date events in the life of the supposed author^ 
it is not likely that he was over-scrupulous in 
other matters. The Memoirs represent, then, a 
mass of almost contemporary gossip and tradi- 
tion, vivified by being put into the mouth of a 
witty and charming woman, who wishes her 
grandson to profit by her wide experience of the 
world. The matter of authorship did not trouble 
the book's first public, who, when the Memoirs 
appeared in 1834,, seized upon it with avidity, 
finding verisimilitude if not truth in its contents. 
So, if the author was a fabulist he was a clever 
one, with an exhaustive knowledge of his sub- 
ject and an entertaining method, more trust- 
worthy at least than the historical novelist's, of 
impressing upon his readers the atmosphere of 
pre-revolutionary France. 

Personalia and ' Men and Manners of the Third 
politics of the Republic,' from the pen of Mr. 
Third Republic. Albert D. Vandam, and published 
by Messrs. James Pott & Co., is the last volume 
we shall have from the popular author of * An 
Englishman in Paris '; for death overtook him 
before the book was quite ready for the press, 
and it was necessary for another hand to put the 
finishing touches to his manuscript. Long resi- 
dence in Paris, with abundant leisure and ample 
means during at least a part of that period^ 
appears to have given the author pre-eminent 
qualifications for detailing the gossip of the boule- 
vards; and those interested in what he has to 
offer will find his chapters highly entertaining. 
Yet we must not convey a false impression : Mr. 
Vandam also conducts us into the labyrinth of 
French politics with a confidence in his own pow- 
ers of guidance that is very wonderful. We learn 
some new things which, if true, are noteworthy, -- 
for example, how very easily the sons of Louis 
Philippe could have saved their father's throne 
in 1848 had they cared more for glory and less for 
money; and by what a mere accident the Third 
Republic came into existence in 1870, when Jules 
Favre, at one o'clock in the morning of the mem- 
orable fourth of September, was permitted by a 
compliant chairman to move the deposition of the

* every inch a king,' and Thiers, Gambetta, Grevy

tempt. As throwing an occasional side-light on 
an important epoch in French histoiy, the book 
has its value; but one may question whether the 
revival of memories intimately associated with 
party quarrels and international hatreds tends to 
promote the concord of nations, or even, when the 
memoirs rise at times hardly above the level of 
gossip, to contribute to the edification of the 
individual reader.

He was born in June, 1850, at Leucadia, Santa 
Maura, Ionian Islands. His childhood and boyhood 
were passed in Wales, Ireland, England, and 
France, and he was educated by a private tutor and 
at various Eoman Catholic schools and colleges. His 
guardian, a grand-aunt, losing her property, young 
Hearn was sent to America at the age of nineteen 
to make his way. He learned the printer's trade in 
Cincinnati, and afterwards became a journalist 
there. He then went to New Orleans, where he 
remained ten years as an editorial writer. In 1887 
he went to the West Indies, two years later to New 
York, and from there to Japan, where he found 
employment as a teacher. He married a Japanese 
wife, and became a subject of the empire, taking 
the name of Y. Koizumi. In 1896 he was appointed 
a lecturer on English literature in the Imperial 
University of Tokyo, but he resigned this position 
in 1903. His books, dealing mainly with the spirit- 
ual life of Japan, number over fifteen.

Religion and the Higher Life 

By William Rainey Harper, President of the University of Chicago. 

A collection of addresses, more or less informal, delivered by the author to companies of young men and womeai. 
The topics are the practical questions of the religious life that the youth of both sexes are all compelled to consider 
whether they will or not. The author says in his preface, " I have in this way discharged, in a measure, a responsii- 
bility which has weighed upon me more heavily than any other connected with the office which I have been called to 
administer." Some of the more important topics are as follows : 

Fellowship and Its Obligations — Service. 1 Religious Belief Among College Students. 

Our Intellectual Difficulties. | Bible Study and the Religious Life.

Studies in General Physiology 

By Jacques Loeb, Professor of Physiology in the University of California. 

These volumes contain the results of Professor Loeb's researches in the general problems of life-phenomena, 
embracing the author's publications in journal articles and monographs, often now inaccessible, published during 
the last twenty years. The two volumes constitute the only complete and orderly account of the author's important 
researches in this field, with occasional notes and revisions. The leading topics which are treated are animal helio- 
tropism and geotropism, instinct and will in animals, heteromorphosis, the limits of divisibility of living matter, 
regeneration, artificial parthenogenesis, the physiological effects of ions, the effect of salt solutions on the muscles, 
and the transformation and regeneration of organs. The experiments are presented in a way that is perfectly intel- 
ligible to laymen, although the researches appeal primarily to scientists.

NOTES ON EU ROPE AN LIBRARIES. 

In connection with the annual meeting of the 
American Library Association^ held this Fall at 
St. Louis, and given something of an interna- 
tional character bv the presence of numerous 
visitors from abroad, the monthly periodical, 
* Public Libraries,^ has devoted the greater part 
of its October issue to a series of special articles 
upon library conditions in other countries than 
our own. These papers include, besides reports 
from England, the British Colonies, and Japan, 
an account, partly historical, partly descriptive, 
of public library work in Germany, Austria, 
Denmark, Sweden, Holland, Finland, Switzer- 
land, and France. The matter provided is 
extremely interesting, and we have thought it 
desirable to make a summary of its principal 
features, accompanied by such comment as they 
seem to call for. 

The public library idea in Germany finds its 
earliest sponsor in Martin Luther. The great 
reformer is quoted as exhorting the aldermen of 
all German cities to establish Christian schools, 
and to ' spare neither diligence nor expense to 
provide good libraries or book houses.' He 
even goes on to specify tlie sort of books that 
these libraries should contain, making it clear 
that he has in view the needs of the people at 
large rather than those of the learned profes- 
sions. The real beginning of popular libraries 
in the modem sense has, however, a much more 
recent date than the sixteenth century. It is 
ascribed to the impress made by American 
example upon the historian Kaumer, who visited 
this country in 1841, was astonished to find our 
working-people so well read, and, upon his return 
home, set about the establishment of the Volks- 
hihUotheken- in Berlin. The fact of fundamental 
importance about German library conditions is 
that almost everywhere there is a hard and fast 
distinction between the Stadthihliotheh and the 
Volksbhbliofhek. The former is a vast insti- 
tution which the general public is not encour- 
aged to use ; the latter is a meagre collection of 
such third-rate literature as the masses of the 
people are supposed to be able to appreciate. In 
many such libraries, we are told, the books of 
such men as Heyse, Keller, and Storm are not 
to be found, because they are imagined to be 
' over the heads ' of the ' people.' Tlie superior- 
ity of our American idea of a single general col- 
lection for all classes of readers is very apparent, 
and it is now being copied in such few of the 



260 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



German nmnicipalities as are not impeded by 
the_ existence of a StadtbihliotheJc upon an 
ancient foundation. But the prevalent German 
arrajigement, which provides, as has been neatly 
said, ' public libraries for the professor and the 
washerwoman/ forces large classes of the most 
intelligent readers to get their books through 
private channels. In technical and professional 
matters, American influences are gradually mak- 
ing themselves felt; but it will be a long time 
before the conservative ruling cla^sses will come 
to appreciate the educational mission of the 
library as we have now come to realize it in the 
United States. 

A condition of affairs closely resembling that 
existing in Germany is found in Denmark, 
which also presents the two types of library — 
the large central (city or university) collection, 
and the inadequate people's library, which we 
are told is ' mainly of importance in giving 
access to good fiction.' Even in the capital, 
the papular libraries contain only a few thou- 
sand volumes each, and are open for only two 
or three hours in the evening. The village and 
parish libraries are upon an even more modest 
scale than this, having in some cases not more 
than a few hundred volumes, and being grateful 
for a state subsidy of two or three dollars a year. 
Yet the Danes are great readers, and are so 
thoroughly appreciative of what opportunities 
they have that the librarian may regard the 
country as offering particularly fruitful soil for 
his missionar}^ labors. 

Swedish conditions are naturally a good deal 
like Danish conditions. In the country, the 
parish libraries seldom contain above five hun- 
dred volumes. The people's library of Gothen- 
burg, the outcome of private philanthropy, with 
a fine building and nine thousand books, comes 
nearer than any other institution in Sweden to 
resemblinp" an American public library. In 
Stockholm also, private philanthropy and coop- 
erative enterprise have provided several collec- 
tions that are largely used by the working- 
classes. 

The story of Finland's libraries is the record 
of a paithetic struggle for culture against poverty 
and adverse conditions generally. There are 
now in the countr}^ besides the subsidized or 
endowed libraries of the towns, about eighteen 
hundred parish libraries. In fact, nearly every 
Tinnish parish has one or more libraries, a state 
of things which cannot help reminding us of 
the New England towns. These libraries a,re 
Tery small affairs naturally, averaging two or 
three hundred volumes each, and the ' bibliothe- 
cary ' is rewarded by the munificent salary of 
five or ten dollars annually. But the Finns are 
zealous in the pursuit of popular education, and 
are entitled to the warmest sympathies of all 



mankind in their present desperate effort to 
preserve their racial ideals from absorption bv 
the mighty empire which controls their political 
destinies. 

We are again reminded of New England 
(this time by contrast), when we read the open- 
ing paragraph of the account of Dutch public 
libraries. The writer says : ' While the state 
of Massachusetts has 351 towns with free 
libraries and two towns without them, there 
are in the whole Kingdom of the Netherlands 
only two towns with such an institution.' This 
does not mean, however, that there are no popu- 
lar libraries of other kinds. On the contrary, 
there are many such, established by societies and 
subscription. But Dordrecht and Groningen 
are the only tovras that have free public libraries 
in our understanding of the term. 

Austria, with its mixed population, makes a 
fair account of itself, although the popular 
libraries are almost without exception the result 
of private or social enterprise, and may be used 
only upon the payment of a small fee. Vienna 
provides public support for its public libraries 
to the amount of about ten thousand dollars a 
year, and this subsidy, in addition to the fees, 
results in a circulation of over three millions. 

Little Switzerland, also a country of mixed 
population, does much better than the great 
Empire. A library census taken nearly forty 
years ago showed more than two thousand 
libraries whose ' express purpose was the satisfy- 
ing of the demand for reading, of whatever 
character, of any considerable and varying num- 
ber of people.' Conditions have improved 
greatly since that reckoning, but it is interest- 
ing to know that, even then, few places were 
so small or so remote as to be entirely without 
the civilizing agency of a collection of books for 
public use. The national libraxy at Bern now 
comes near to the American ideal of a great pub- 
lic library. Its use is absolutely free, and, upon 
payment of postage, residents of any part of 
Switzerland can have books sent to them, up to 
six volumes at a time. State and municipal 
library appropriations have largely increased of 
late years, and professional ideas of manage- 
ment are rapidly gaining ground. 

The last of our notes has France for its sub- 
ject, this being the only Latin country repre- 
sented in the series of articles which has served 
us for material. We are told at the start that 
'^ the public library system of France has been 
developed largely through the inspiration re- 
ceived originally from an American, and that 
our own Benjamin Franklin.' It was a Frank- 
lin Society, founded by one M. Giraxd about 
half a century ago, that inaugurated the move- 
ment for popular libraries in France, and has 
supported that movement ever since. These

libraries are not free, but the fees exacted are 
small, and do not prevent the books from being 
Avidely circulated. The collections are of a prac- 
tical character, and are used mainly by working- 
people. 



A CRITIC ON C RITICISM. 

Professor George Saintsbury's History of 
Criticism is more than a book — it is an explor- 
ation, almost a conquest. One might picture 
Professor Saintsbur}- as Herakles — or was it 
Dionysius — returning in triumph from India 
with a mighty train of captives, noble chiefs 
and savage anthropophagi, elephants and tigers, 
harnessed hydras and chimeras dire. That any 
man, living under the security of modern laws 
and in the comfort of modern society, should 
venture into the dens and lairs of all the wild 
animals of criticism of all Europe and, engag- 
ing them single-handed, should bring them 
forth to the light for our horror or our mirth, 
makes us think better of our species. In all 
soberness, Professor Saintsbur/s scholarship 
and industry are alike prodigious ; and not less 
remarkable are the ease and unfailing gayety 
with which the}' are displayed. 

The present writer can only claim acquaint- 
ance with the greater of the critics with whom 
Professor Saintsbury deals. Of others he can 
say with Shelley, " I looked on them nine sev- 
eral days, and then I saw that they were bad." 
Nevertheless, with acknowledgements for intel- 
lectual obligations and deference for superior 
scholarship, he must join issue with the his- 
torian of criticism on some points of doctrine. 
Even the historian of a subject may be mistaken 
or blinded by partisanship. The late George 
Henry Ijewes's History of Philosophy is one of 
the cleverest books of its kind, — but it is a 
review of metaphysics by a man who was inca- 
pable of knowing what metaphysics meant. I 
would not venture to intimate anything of the 
sort in regard to Professor Saintsbury, but so 
far at least in his progress he has in great 
measure shirked the problems of Esthetic. He 
is, indeed, rather fond of the Arnoldesque pose 
of being a plain man who can see very little use 
in the subtleties of philosophy. He may be 
right. But they have a saying in South 
America that if you twitch a liana on the bor- 
ders of Bolivia you will disturb the President 
at Eio, — so interminable and intertangled are 
the vines and foliage of that primeval forest. 
In the same way, one can hardly touch a ques- 
tion of literary art without causing a commo- 
tion all along the line. You speak of Beauty, 
and that brings up the problem of the Gro- 



tesque; and then Horror, and the forms of 
Tragedy, start up beyond. And these matters 
can only be debated in the terms of gesthetic 
and metaphysic, — terms which have been pol- 
ished and worn by twenty-five centuries of use. 
We must, for all Professor Saintshury, go to the 
Germans for such discussion; or, in English, 
to Bosanquet's History of Esthetic, or Sydney 
Colvin's admirable little treatise on the Fine 
Arts. 

But Professor Saintsbury has a clue that 
leads him through the labyrinths of art, — a 
magic book that protects him against the 
demons and misleading phantoms of philosophy. 
I remember once hearing a drunken man in a 
street-car discourse to himself about a repast 
from which he had just risen. ' We had crackers 
and cheese — and sardines — and cheese and 
crackers — and crackers and beer — and crack- 
ers and cheese,' — so his monologue ran on. 
Similarly, at his banquet of criticism Professor 
Saintsbury has had Longinus — and Aristotle 
— and Longinus — and Horace — and Quinti- 
lian — and Longinus — and Scaliger and 
Boileau — and Longinus. What is there in 
Longinus to be so overwhelming and efficacious ? 
' Mass, I cannot tell \' Or, in a locution of the 
street, which ShaJcespeare would have liked, 
' Search me ! ' The little book ' On the Sub- 
lime ' is a magnificent rhapsody about literature. 
It stirs one like the sound of the trumpet. Any 
man ought to write more nobly from reading 
it. But of actual teaching, its content is null. 
One might almost sum up Longinus's theory in 
a score of words. ' The poet must be inspired, 
and he must communicate his ecstacy to his 
readers by means of fit and perfect words. ' 
What is there wonderful in that ? Plato almost 
exactly anticipated it, and Byron glimpses it in 
the couplet from * Don Juan,' — 

' The best of Ufe Is but Intoxication ; 
Man, being reasonable, must get drunk.' 

Longinus's theory is true, — it is the truest 
kind of truth ; but it takes us only a short way 
on in the study of literature. 

Mr. Saintsbury's affection for Longinus is 
only one sign of the fact that from the begin- 
ning he has taken sides in the great perennial 
conflict of criticism, — the conflict between idea 
and form. His denial of the supremacy of 
design, his negation of matter, his love for the 
mot propre, are completing indications. One 
can hardly write on such matters without tak- 
ing sides ; but an historian should be impartial. 
And however the literary critics may divide on 
this question, it is certain that Professor 
Saintsbury has the great writers against him. 
It would seem that the supreme masters, having 
for their birthright the gift of language, or soon

acquiring it, never tire of pouring contempt on 
the traffickers in phrase and word. Shake- 
speare's first comedy, ' Love's - Labor Lost,' is 
largely devoted to the ridicule of the phrase- 
mongers, the language refiners of his day. He 
makes Pistol caricature Marlowe's strutting 
speech. He interrupts the preciosity of Polo- 
nius with ' more matter with less art.' Osric 
offends Hamlet, and Hotspur cannot down with 
the fine speeches of the perfumed courtier. It 
is the same with Moliere. He devotes two plays, 
the * Precieuses Ridicules ' and the ' Femmes 
Savantes/ to setting forth for all time the 
absurdities of preciosity and pedantry in style. 
And he makes Alceste offend Oronte by prefer- 
ring the plain, simple old ballad-style to the 
wonderful word concoctions of that pseudo 
poet. Goethe, in his autobiography, laughs at 
image-hunters and writers who imagine adject- 
ives will do the work of ideas. Practically all 
the discussions in his correspondence with 
Schiller are discussions about ideas. Neither of 
these poets seems to have taken much more 
thought for language than birds do for the notes 
they utter. Schopenhauer, a great critic as well 
as philosopher, says again and again that it is 
weight of matter, and that alone, which makes 
style. Matthew Arnold, towards the end of his 
life, said to a friend, ' The young men come to 
me and think I can teach them style! Style! 
Let them have something to say, and say it 
clearly and concisely, and they will have style.' 
What more, indeed, could they need? If you 
have something to say 5'ou are original, and if 
you can say it you are an artist, — and there's 
an end on't. Yet Professor Saintsbury seems 
to think that words, divested of matter and 
devoid of design, may somehow form themselves 
into things of beauty, — may become style. It 
is the theory of the spontaneous evolution of the 
universe, in miniature. 

Eather curiously, the least satisfactory part, 
historically, of Professor Saintsbury's work is 
his treatment of the great stylistic delusion 
which began with Marino in Italy, and was 
spread by Lylly and the Euphuists in England, 
by Gongora in Spain, and by the Ladies of the 
Hotel Eambouillet in France. He deals with it, 
of course, but hardly attaches the importance to 
it that it deserves, in the way of terrible example. 
It was the first widespread adoration of the 
word in literature; the second is in operation 
to-day. We have again the refinements and 
subtleties of language, — the nuance, the 
' impression,' the ' symbol,' the mot propre. All 
those are simply our old euphuistic friends with 
fresh-washed faces. Authors again call on their 
friends to behold the birth of a phrase, as Kings 
used to bring tbeir courtiers into the Queen's 
chamber to witness the delivery of a prince. 
Writers explain to us how hard they labor with 



words, in order to make us see and feel and 
smell the objects they describe. The really great 
writer simply has a soul filled with passions, 
emotions, thoughts. He expresses them, he 
cares little how, — and the world has a posses- 
sion forever. 

Is there anything much more ridiculous than 
the theory of the mot propre as formulated by 
Flaubert and other French writers ? That each 
idea or object has one sole and only word 
belonging to it, — that they are like Plato's 
original round four-armed and four-legged ani- 
mal, which the gods cut in half and so made 
man and woman, who have been hunting each 
other ever since, — or, a better resemblance, that 
they are like the ticket num^ber and the prize in 
the two wheels of the lottery ; such is the famous 
mot propre delusion. The writers who adopt it 
will not accept the fact that words are merely 
arbitrary sounds or signs to denote ideas and 
things. Adam named all the creatures in the 
beginning, and if we only had his nomenclature 
there might be something in the sacred conjugal 
coupling of words and things. But the tower 
of Babel put an end to all that. It is futile and 
pedantic to give examples of the arbitrariness 
of words; but one or two may be worth while. 
I take the names applied to the ocean. In 
Greek we have Thalatta; in Latin, Mare or 
A equor; in German, Meer; and in English, sea. 
^Vhich of those is the mot propre for the ocean? 
Or take the French word ondoyant and the Eng- 
lish equivalent waving. To my fancy both of 
these words have, what is very rare, a quality 
of sound indicative of the meaning. But if one 
of them is the sole and only word to denote the 
thing, what is the other? Of course, what the 
French writers mean by the mot propre, though 
they do not say so, is the phrase rather than the 
single word. But the phrase is a matter of asso- 
ciation of ideas. Give two writers of equal 
talent the same thing to describe, and they will 
certainly describe it differently, but very likely 
equally well. And this is necessary; for if it 
were not the ease, if there were only certain 
inevitable words to describe each idea or thing 
— then there would soon ensue that Finality of 
expression which Professor Saintsbury very 
rightly dreads. The proper words for every- 
thing would soon be caught; lists would be 
drawn up, and tabulated, and there would be 
an end of literature. 

If Professor Saintsbury is more certain of 
one thing than of any other, it is that pleasure 
is the sole end of art, and that beauty is the 
means by which it achieves its purpose. He 
says of Milton's theodicy, that 'it is a noble 
error.' One would like to know what Milton 
would have said of him, — Milton, who thought 
that in order to write a noble poem one must 
first achieve a noble life ; Milton, who said that

he ' dared be known to think our sage and 
serious Spenser a better teacher of moral excel- 
lence than Aquinas or Augustine ' ; Milton, who 
wrote his great poem to vindicate the ways of 
God to man. One would like to know, too, what 
Dante would have said to Professor Saintsbury 
enlisting him, on the score of a few careless 
sentences, in the ranks of the followers of 
beauty and preciosity, — Dante, whose mind 
more than that of any other man was filled 
with images of gloom and horror; who valued 
words mainly as weapons with which to smite 
his foes, or as torches to reveal his God. A 
moment's examination of any absolutely 
supreme piece of literature will show, it seems 
to me, the falsity of the theory that pleasure is 
the end of art, beauty the means. Take, for 
instance, ' King Lear,' possibly the most tre- 
mendous exhibition of creative energy which 
exists in literature. Beauty may be dismissed 
at once as having much concern with this work. 
Save in a few scenes relating to Cordelia or 
Kent, there is no beauty in the action. There is 
little beauty even in the language. Shakespeare 
troubles himself not at all with melodies or 
harmonies, with pictures of charm or perfection. 
The verse shrills and crashes and rolls in deafen- 
ing discord over a blasted and ruined world. 
Psychical deformities, physical horrors, mad- 
nesses and deaths, are piled one upon another. 
Everything is wrapped in the hues of earth- 
quake and eclipse. That beauty is the body of 
such a work, pleasure its purpose, it is monstrous 
to think. The words are absurd in their 
inadequacy, almost banality. Were all the 
critics of Christendom to accept such a theory, 
I would not accept it. And we do not have 
to accept it. Aristotle's view, that the use 
of tragedy is for purification, discipline, instruc- 
tion, training in heroism and virtue, is much 
nearer the mark. The notion that pleasure is 
the end of art is akin to the selfish view of 
ethics which postulates that men will make no 
effort, will put forth no energj^, save for their 
own good. • It is not so. Duty and Honor are 
in the world. It is not exactly for pleasure that 
men are being killed or mangled on the glacis 
or in the fortress of Port Arthur. It is not 
exactly for pleasure that Lieutenant Peary and 
his alien comrades push into the icy deserts of 
the north. It was not exactly for pleasure, I 
imagine, that Professor Saintsbur\' himself has 
poked into the literary dust-bins of twenty-four 
centuries in order to write his book. And it is 
not for pleasure solely, or largely, that we deal 
with literature. We do not read the great poets 
and philosophers because we viT)uld, but because 
we must. They not only fascinate, they com- 
mand ; they do not only delight, they dominate. 
If at times we are their masters, and sit in 
pleasant ease lulled by their pipings and their 



songs, at other times we are their slaves and 
do their errands and bear their messages 
through the world. 

In one of the best passages of his book Pro- 
fessor Saintsbur}^ adjures us to throw away the 
notion of Finality in literature, to discard the 
tyranny of rules and kinds, to do away with 
tradition and authority, and accept what novel 
theories or fresh forms of art may offer them- 
selves to us and judge them on their own merits. 
It is well and justly urged. Partisans of the 
past are usually foes of the future. Yet how 
are we to Icnow the good and true in the 
innumerable novelties which are offered us? 
Are we, like Falstaff's Lion, certain to recognize 
the true Prince? It is quite doubtful. 
Inherited traditions and trained tastes are at 
least powerful helps to correct judgment; and 
though hard to get at and difficult to hold, there 
are standards of measurement more certain 
than the foot of the reigning King. Professor 
Saintsbury recommends us to apply the queries 
' Why?' and ' Why Not?' alike to old rules and 
new theories of art. Let us do so, by all means ; 
but let us take a wide enough cast in answering 
them. In England and America today the 
militant, dominant writers hold theories of 
art which, I imagine, must offend everyone of 
Professor Saintebury's instincts and convictions. 
To these writers, Shakespeare, Milton, Keats, 
are already classics as cold in their remote- 
ness as the Greeks. To them, the criticism of 
Coleridge, Hazlitt, Arnold, and Lowell is as 
antiquated as the neo-classical criticism is to 
Professor Saintsbury. To them prose is a better 
medium of expression than verse, — ^ poetry 
being, indeed, in their view, as obsolete as the 
garments of our grandfathers. To them, the 
final and finest forms of literature are either 
the long novel mirroring the dull facts of life 
with painful accuracy, or the short story- 
modeled after the newspaper paragraph, and 
like the flash of a policeman's lantern on some 
sordid scene. I do not think any of these beliefs 
will please Professor Saintsbury ; but how is he 
going to defend us from them, if he throws 
overboard tradition, authority, and comparison 
with the past? Charles Leonard Moore. 



Mr. Frederick Starr has made an interesting col- 
lection of representative extracts from the writ-

which contains them, now issued by the Open

whose names are almost wholly unknown to our 
public, although we are the nearest of Mexico's

represented in these pages, and the translations

Where is to be found the faculty who will 
thus dispense all wisdom? We turn the pages 
with bated breath, fearing to learn that the 
professors of Harvard, Oxford, Cambridge, and 
Berlin have seceded in a body and are now on 
their way to Washington. But not so; the 
faculties of those places are fossilised, anyway, 
and would be quite unsuited for the I. C. U. 

' The Faculty of the I. C. U, is divided into two 
groups — the Kegulax Faculty and the Advisory 
Faculty. Space does not permit me to tell you 
about all of the various Deans, Professors, Text- 
writers, Instructors, etc. It is sufficient to state 
that I have placed at the head of these Faculties 
two of the ablest and most efficient educators in the 
world, ' 

We then learn that Dr. J. F. Crowell is Edu- 
cational Director, and Dr. W. T. Harris is 
Chairman of the Advisory Faculty. Not 
another member of the numerous faculties is 
mentioned. ' Dr. Harris,' — the name sounds 
familiar; oh yes, to be sure: 

' William Torrey Harris, LL. D.," is recognized 
throughout the civilized globe as one of the fore- 
most educators of any age. Thousands call him the 
greatest living philosopher; Americans call him the 
Chief of the greatest Educational system, and all 
recognize in him a tremendous power for good. Not 
on account of these things, but because of his true 
worth as a scholar, a thinker and a man — did we 
choose him as the Chairman of our Advisory Fac- 
ulty.' 

And a foot note : 

' '^ As you know, the public school system of the United 
States is the best in the world. It has over fifteen million 
students, and over four hundred and thirty thousand 
teachers. The annual expenditure is over two hundred 
and twenty-six million dollars, of which the teachers 
receive one hundred and forty-two million dollars in 
annual salaries. The Chairman of our Advisory Faculty, 
Hon. William Torrey Harris, has been for fifteen years, 
and is now, at the head of this great system.' 

It is not explicitly stated that the said system 
will be annexed to the I. C. U. 

The president also sends a typwrittten letter. 
As it is manifestly of a circular nature, and 
was in reply to a perfectly bald request for the

A NEW SPECIES OF UNIVERSITY. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 
There has recently appeared in the advertising 
pages of certain magazines a prospectus of a new 
and remarkable institution, established in the 
City of Washington. Its name is the Intercon- 
tinental Correspondence University, and its 
motto is ' The World our Class Eoom.' There is 
no mention of the other planets. 

The President of this institution, Dr. Channing 
Rudd, has issued a pamphlet entitled 'The Per- 
sonal Statement of the President,' which is sent 
to all who apply. It contains a 'foreword' which 
states that 
'WE^ 

David J. Brewer, 

Henry Billings Brown, 
Walter C. Clephane, 
Chauncey M. Depew, 
George F. Hoar, 

Edward Everett Hale, 
Martin A. Knapp, 

Henry B. F. Macfarland, 
Channing Eudd, 
have founded the Intercontinental Correspondence 
University because we believe that there is a field 
in the educational world unoccupied, and that this 
field is as broad as the world itself,' etc., etc. 

' ^ Just to refresh your memory, I will briefiy mention 
some well-known facts about my co-founders.' [They fol- 
low, in the manner of ' Who's Who.'] 

Turning over the page, we find the personal 
statement itself, beginning thus : 

' Do YOU 

Need, or want, or desire, or wish 
A better educational equipment for the business 
of life? 
A better special education? 
A better general education? 

A better partial education? 
Any item of information? 

Any part of any phase of knowledge? 
The mastery of any subject? 

or any part of any subject?' 

It is understood that this is not intended for 
a skit on Walt Whitman. It is not even 
intended to be poetry. But let us proceed : 

' There are thousands of men and women in the 
world today who need a better education, and to 
whom such an education has heretofore been out of 
reach. ... I am in a position to say to these 
men and women, and do say, write to me and I will 
assist you in learning anything you desire to know. 
I am in a position to say this without qualification. 
There is no department of knowledge which can not 
be taught, and I am prepared to demonstrate that 
any department of knowledge which can be taught, 
can be taught by mail. We shall, therefore, teach 
everything which is teachable. For this reason our 
institution is called a University. It is universal 
in its function as a teacher. It embraces everything. 
It omits nothing. An undertaking the like of which 
has never heretofore been attempted in the history 
of the world. ... I believe that the methods 
that prevail in many schools, colleges and univer- 
sities are antiquated and old-fashioned. . . . 
This University gives just as thorough an education 
as any school, college or viniversity in the world,

quoted all the above for the sake of mere 
hilarity. It is a serious matter for this country 
that it should be possible for a body of men of 
undoubted high ability and wide reputation to 
put forth such a scheme, heralded in such a 
manner. To me, it seems from beginning to 
end in the most wretched taste; yet it cannot 
so seem to the promoters, who are no innocents 
from an unswept comer of the world. Probably 
it will seem all right to a large section of the 
public. If I am wrong, may I be forgiven; 
but frankly, I should despair of a nation to 
which the prospectus of the I. C. U. appeared a 
fit and natural thing. Setting aside the ques- 
tion of taste, it appears to me to be nonsense. 
Every scientific man believes in the correspon- 
dence method, conducts a correspondence school 
himself. I have nothing against the method in 
reason; but to advance the view that education 
by correspondence is a fit substitute for per- 
sonal contact is a totally different matter. It 
is the result of a mechanical conception of edu- 
cation which is the natural and hateful product 
of a commercial age. Moreover, even if it were 
possible to teach as well through the mails as 
any other way, where is the faculty to come 
from ? Money will not multiply the really first 
class men in the countr}% and what is more, 
such men will not follow the methods of the 
I. C. U., which would be extremely wasteful of 
their time and energy. It is all very well to 
be a trustee or the chairman of a faculty, but 
it is not without reason that we hear nothing 
about the names of the actual teachers. Prob- 
ably the faculties Avill really contain some well- 
known names, but of necessity the work of 
teaching, where ' You may start at any time. 
There are no regular classes; you will be in a 
class by yourself will have to be turned over 
to the mules of the profession. 

There is undoubtedly a useful field for a cor- 
respondence-school in Washington. A body of 
reasonably competent men, able to consult the 
national libraries and collections and extract 
desired information therefrom, would be very 
serviceable. A great amount of such work is 
done by the Government Bureaus, and I think 
very properly and usefully; but it might very 
well be supplemented by an institution charging 
fees for work not properly within the scope of 
the government, or too extensive for it to under- 
take. I formerly hoped that the Carnegie Insti- 
tution might do this sort of work, and if the 
I. C. U. can settle down to this or any other 
reasonable field of activity we may be duly 
thankful. If it can then find a more acceptable 
name, we may even come to regard it with 
affection : — but it was asked of old, how shall 
the leopard change his spots?

A IS^EW Portrait of " Old Hickory." * 

A new portrait of the most unique of the 
great Americans who have reached the highest 
positions in military and civil life is to be 
welcomed. We have the great work of Parton, 
written more than a generation ago; the hostile 
study of Professor Sumner, who condemned 
almost everything that Jackson favored, while 
he appreciated the quality of his manhood; the 
appreciative sketch of Mr. W. Gr. Brown; and 
the studies of Jackson to be found in the his- 
tories of the times. Still there is room for a 
new study of this remarkable man from the 
point of view of today, and the greatness of his 
influence upon the development of our institu- 
tions and our political life would seem to 
demand it. 

Mr. Buell, who did not live to see his book 
in print, has written with enthusiasm for his 
subject, and has put into the work a great 
amount of labor; but he can hardly be said to 
have met the demand for a modern life of Jack- 
son. His letters show that from the reading 
of his first book at the age of seven years, — 
Judge Alexander Walker's * Jackson and New 
Orleans, ' — when his imagination and his 
interest were captured, the personality and 
achievements of General Jackson have been a 
life-study with Mr. Buell, and that he has not 
only read everything in print or manuscript 
that he could find concerning him, but that an 
even more important part of his preparation 
for writing this book were personal interviews 
with many of those who had known General 
Jackson as friends and acquaintances ; and some 
of these interviews bring out the personality of 
the subject most vividly. 

The book is very interesting, for Mr. Buell's 
long experience in newspaper work has taught 
him how to tell a story well, and the career of 
Jackson furnishes material that even a poor 
writer could hardly make uninteresting. But 
with all his facility as a writer, and his study 
and loving care in working out the story of 
Jackson's life, he fails through lack of judicial 
fairness to make a biography which shall satisfy 
the thoughtful student of our national life. 
W^hile he seems to try to be fair, he has adopted 
many of Jackson's own prejudices, and the book 
fails to ring true for this reason. And to some 
of these prejudices he gives expression so often 
that the reader loses sympathy with him in his 
narrative. One of these prejudices is that

against England. In a letter quoted by the 
publishers in their preface to the work, he says : 
' It is at least an American book — not an Eng- 
lish one, like Parton's. I could not have writ- 
ten an Anglomaniac book if I had tried; but if 
I had tried and succeeded, it would not have 
been Jackson.' It is hard for him to mention 
England without a fling at her arrogance, her 
greed, and her duplicity; and he gloats over 
her failures and misfortunes in her relations 
with us, as Jackson himself did. Mr. Buell 
also shares Jackson's hatred for Clay and Cal- 
houn, and sees for the most part only petti- 
fogging partisanship in their acts. Kew Eng- 
land and her statesmen also seem to irritate 
him, and he shows very little veneration for 
Webster and John Quincy Adams, though there 
is in his comments on them nothing of the 
venom that he has put into whatever he has 
to say of Jackson's special foes. 

Of course these prejudices narrow the work 
and destroy much of its value as. a contribu- 
tion to history; but after making allowanioes 
for these defects, we are glad to commend it as 
a most interesting study of the personality and 
character of this great leader of the plain peo- 
ple in their upward march to the control of 
their government. Most accounts of Jackson's 
early life have made it appear vulgar and sordid 
in its ignorance, poverty, and recklessness. Mr. 
Buell has so shaped his account as to remove 
this impression, while agreeing substantially 
with his predecessors as to the facts; and we 
think that he has presented to us the real 
Andrew Jackson. Jackson's surroundings were 
indeed crude and primitive ; but he shared these 
limitations with the best people of his section 
and time, and his ability to meet with distinc- 
tion all the social demands of his later career, 
not only in Tennessee but in New Orleans and 
Washington, goes to show that Mr. Buell is 
right. It may also be said, in passing, that 
Mrs. Jackson, — or 'Aunt Kachel,' as everyone 
called her who knew her, — is shown to be by 
no means the vulgar frontierswoman that she 
has been pictured; although a frontierswoman 
in the same sense in which her husband was 
a frontiersman, she had the good sense and help- 
ful spirit that made her universally loved where 
she Avas known. And she was equal to the 
social demands of Tennessee, though not ready 
in mature years to adapt herself to the far dif- 
ferent social environment of the national 
capital; from the necessity of this change 
death freed her just as she was to depart for 
Washington to become the mistress of the White 
House. 

Mr. Buell makes no attempt to cover the 
faults of Jackson's character. His impetuous- 



ness, his readiness to fight on small provocation 
and to kill his opponent if that opponent had 
touched the sensitive spots in his being, his 
ineradicable prejudices, his readiness toi impute 
the worst motives to any persons, however 
exalted in character or position, who opposed 
him or who disagreed with him on public ques- 
tions, his arbitrary conduct in office, overriding 
the instructions of his superiors and the law 
that limited his power, — all of these faults, 
and many others, are evident to one who reads 
this book. Yet the author does not dwell upon 
them as do hostile writers, while he is always 
ready to plead extenuating circumstances and 
conditions. In this attitude toward his subject 
we agree with him; for the best possible case 
should always be made out for one who has 
held high place in power and in the love of 
the people. As a study of the man Andrew 
Jackson, the work is to be highly commended; 
for the author has made his character, his per- 
sonal qualities, and his surroundings stand out 
clearly before the readers, by his skill as a 
writer working on material that he has mastered 
by close and sympathetic study. It not only 
discloses to us the man himself in his externals 
and in the broader lines of his character, but it 
gives us a picture of life and conditions in the 
Southwest in the first half of the nineteenth 
century that is distinctly valuable. The story 
of the development of society from frontier 
conditions to the settled life of Jackson's later 
days, with the passions and prejudices of the 
early society of that region, is one of great 
interest, and it is well told. 

Especially interesting is the account of the 
brilliant victory at New Orleans, which could so 
easily have been a defeat and have lost us the 
great Louisiana Territory. We would call 
attention t© what is told of the designs of the 
British government to get possession of that 
vast region, whatever the Treaty of Ghent 
might say as to the restoration of conditions 
to the state before the war. It was supposed 
that the great expedition could not fail; the 
signature of the trea.ty was delayed until New 
Orleans must have been seized, as the British 
commissioners thought, and then the British 
were to refuse to -give up Louisiana on the 
ground that the successive Spanish and French 
cessions were void. While this plan of the 
British has been disclosed in official documents, 
it has not so far been set forth in popular 
works; and Mr. Buell, writing as he does in 
hostility to England, makes mucli of what he 
calls British treachery in sending the expedi- 
tion for this purpose after the commissioners 
had already assembled at Ghent to draw up a 
treaty of peace. Charles H. Cooper.

A Biography of the Mixd.* 

Within a volume of less than four hundred 
pages, Prof. Edward Dowden has told with 
leisurely exactness the story of Browning's life, 
has unfolded the growth of his character and 
poetic art, and has given careful study to many 
of his more complex poems. The editor of the 
series of ' Temple Biographies,' the Rev. 
Dugald Macfadyen, in prefacing this volume, 
has chosen Gladstone's phrase for apt illustra- 
tion, — ' a biography of the mind. ' The author 
also emphasizes this special aim. While trac- 
ing the inward development of the poet, how- 
ever, he has introduced all the relevant outside 
influences which incited or accompanied each 
special period of Browning's poetic expression. 
Thus the work makes appeal not alone to earn- 
est readers of the poet, but also to the many 
who share the sentiments of Frederick Tenny- 
son, and of Jowett of Balliol, that Browning 
was ' a man of infinite learning, jest, and bon- 
hommie,' with ' a sterling heart that reverbs 
no hollowness,' but that his poetry is ' extrava- 
gant, perverse, and topsy-turvy.' The volume 
is a model of biographical conscience and good 
taste. If the sympathy of the critic at times 
exceeds his judgment, the offense is seldom 
flagrant. Professor Dowden's cordial relations 
with the Brownings, and his ardent study of 
the poet for half a century, tend to make him 
a generous rather than a censorious critic. 
Realizing this tendency, perhaps, he twice 
addresses his readers in Browning's lines from 
* Balaustion's Adventure ' : 

' If I, too, should try and speak at times. 
Leading your love to where my love, perchance, 
Climbed earlier, found a nest before you knew. 
Why, bear with the poor climber, for love's sake.' 

Since the publication of Mrs. Orr's standard 
guide-book to Browning's life and poetry, many 
valuable testimonies to his manly traits and 
his artistic development have appeared in 
volumes of letters by both Browning and his 
wife, and in reminiscences and correspondence 
of many of their intimate friends, notably the 
Rossettis, Milsand, Story, and Mrs. ^ronson. 
Of such illuminative data Professor Dowden 
has made discreet but liberal use, and has pre- 
sented the man and poet in a series of vivid 
chronological portrayals. The first distinct 
analysis deals with the young man, vigorous, 
ambitious, speculative, who as poet has paid 
homage to Byron and Shelley, and has spoken 
his first tentative message to the world in a 
trilogy of strange dramatic studies, ' Pauline,' 
' Paracelsus,' and ' Sordello.' With a similar 
motive, but in diverse settings, these studies in 
verse all depict the flaws in the full develop- 
ment of genius, all tell the story of aspiration,

Biographies Series) . New York : E. P. Button & Co. 



apparent failure, and spiritual victory. The 
young poet is clearly defined, with his rare 
promises and his defects, some of the latter due 
to immaturity and soon to disappear, others 
to linger, increase, and hamper his effectiveness 
in all his later work. Professor Dowden does 
not spend futile effort in condemning or con- 
doning the rhetorical leaps and chasms in 
' Sordello,' but says with refreshing candor, 
' Intelligent, however, as Browning was, it 
implied a curious lack of intelligence to sup- 
pose that a poem of many thousand lines writ- 
ten in shorthand would speedily find decipher- 
ers.' 

The second significant portrait is that of 
Bro^vning ' the Maker of Plays.' His social 
circle has widened, but his poetic method is still 
experimental to a large extent. With reserve 
and fairness. Professor Dowden recites the 
familiar facts regarding the presentation of 
' Strafford ' and 'A Blot on the 'Scutcheon,' 
with the consequent loss of Macready's friend- 
ship for many years. Over the ever-present 
question, ^Are Browning's plays adapted for 
stage use?' the critic lingers for a time, but 
evades a direct answer. To some enthusiasts 
on the subject, he will seem disappointing, but 
many of his statements will meet general assent. 
' In the development of his dramatic style. 
Browning more and more lost sight of the 
theatre and its requirements; his stage became 
more and more a stage of the mind. The 
hastily written "A Blot on the 'Scutcheon" is 
perhaps of all Browning's dramas the best fitted 
for theatrical representation. Yet it is incur- 
ably weak in the motives which determine the 
action; and certain passages are almost ludi- 
crously undramatic' With truth he regards the 
Dramatic Lyrics, especially ' Pippa Passes ' and 
' My Last Duchess,' as far superior poetically to 
the more ambitious dramas. He invents a para- 
graph of skilful, if not quite logical, antithesis 
between 'static and dynamic drama,' the one 
dealing with 'characters in positions,' the 
other with * characters in movement.' ' The 
dramatic genius of Browning was in the main 
of the static kind. It studies with extraordinary 
skill and subtlety character in position; it 
attains only an imperfect or a labored success 
with character in movement.' 

A few years passed before Browning stood 
forth as the poet of ' Christmas Eve ' and 'Easter 
Day,' interpretations, possibly arguments, of 
the ' spiritual life individual ' and ' the spiritual 
life corporate.' During the intervening years, 
vital events had happened to unfold the ix>et's 
heart and soul. Of the romance of these ' two 
wild poets but wise people,' the biographer 
speaks with tender deference, fusing much 
material from the published love-letters of the 
poets and the later journal-records by Mrs.

[Nov. 1, 



Browning of those first happy months in Italy. 
After years of unexpressed poetic growth, ' Men 
and Women ' appeared in 1855, revealing the 
broadened experiences and the assimilated cul- 
ture of the years of Italian residence. Of the 
exuberance of life and passion in these varied 
types of poems, with motives of love, art, and 
religion. Professor Dowden speaks with delight. 
For E'ossetti, they were his ' Elixir of Life,' but 
to Kuskin they seemed ' a mass of conundrums.' 
Such diverse sentiments may well apply to the 
two moods which are represented even to-day 
among Browning's readers. After careful study 
of ' The Statue and the Bust,' with its proble- 
matic test of soul-languor, Professor Dowden 
adds, ' Had Tennyson treated the same sub^ 
ject, he would probably have glorified their 
action as a victorious obedience to the law of 
self -reverence and self-control.' 

It has pleased some sentimental writers and 
many readers to image Browning as a sad, 
brooding man, after Mrs. Browning's death. 
Such an aspect is untrue to the facts, unjust 
to Browning's character, and to his sense of 
duty to his family, his friends, and the fast- 
increasing circle of his admirers. Professor 
Dowden has emphasized and justified, through 
passages in ' Fifine at the Fair,' the new zest 
and productiveness of the poet's long life, while 
he cherished with silent devotion the sacred 
memories of the past. The critic has traced 
the use of material gathered during the years in 
Italy, the many incentives which now were 
expressed from ' Mr. Sludge, the Medium ' and 
' The Ring and the Book ' to the later classical 
poems. There is a long, perhaps needlessly 
detailed, analysis of ^The Ring and the Book.' 
The spiritual relations between Pompilia and 
Caponssachi are strongly illumined. Nearly 
all readers will echo his verdict, that here the 
poet reached the acme of his art, that here he 
concentrated all his powers, his research, pas- 
sion, casuistry, tenderness and pity, robust 
humour, worldly knowledge and spiritual aspi- 
rations. Many were the poems of the last thirty 
years from which the biographer-critic has 
chosen a few to express the poet's maturing 
attainments, — ' Balustion's Adventure ' and 
'Aristophanes' Apology ' with buoyancy of soul 
and unflagging energ}^ of imagination, 'La 
Saisiaz ' with its moan of virile sorrow ending 
with ' the conclusion with BrowTiing of the 
whole matter,' — 

' Hope the arrowy, just as constant, comes to pierce its 

gloora, compelled 
By a power and a purpose which, if no one else beheld, 
I behold in life, so — hope ! ' 

Pen-portraits by friends of later years reveal 
Browning as the teacher and poet of old age. 
In the later volumes there may be ' much mere 
grey argument,' but there are also flashes of 



spiritual insight in ' Pisgah-Sights ' and 'Aso- 
lando.' There are terse well-weighed sen- 
tences of summary on individual poems of later 
composition, as well as a study of the more 
familiar works, thus giving a hand-book value 
to this volume. In the last chapter there is a 
broad survey of Browning's defects and rank. 
Professor Dowden reiterates the poet's weakness 
in action and narrowness in characterization 
compared with Shakespeare, naming Browning 
as a possible successor of Wordsworth, 'not 
indeed as an artist but as a teacher.' One may 
demur at certain opinions regarding Browning's 
literary creed and forms, yet there will be assent 
to this summary of his influence upon his 
readers : ' He plays upon the will, summoning 
it from lethargy to activity. He spiritualizes 
the passions by showing that they tend through 
what is human towards what is divine. He 
assigns to the intellect a sufficient field for 
exercise, but attaches more value to its efforts 
than to its attainments. His faith in an unseen 
order of things creates a hope which persists 
through the apparent failures of earth.'

Modern Bible Studies.* 



The Biblical criticism of the last quarter 
century has revolutionized our conceptions of 
the Old Testament. The aggressive energy of 
that instrument of modern research has required 
a recasting and reconstruction of that litera- 
ture. The expanding results of scholarly 
Biblical criticism have overstepped the bound- 
aries of technical literature, and are now find- 
ing a place in the popular works of the day. 
Such expansion has shown itself in the publica- 
tion of a variety of books designed to enlighten 
the layman in Biblical studies. 

Professor Charles F. Kent has already taken 
a leading place in this country in the popular- 
ization of the results of technical Biblical crit- 
icism. 'The Historical Series' for Bible stu- 
dents, and 'The Messages of the Bible,' both 
issued under the joint editorship of Professors 
Kent and Sanders, have already demonstrated 
what can be done in this direction. There is no 
excuse today for the ignorance of anyone touch- 
ing the chief results of such scholarly research. 
Though its lines are many and often entangled,

there is ample popular literature to set forth 
the problems and their solution. 

Professor Kent's present work is volume one 
in a series of six, designed to cover the Old 
Testament. Its aim is, ' (1) to re-arrange the 
writings of the Old Testament in a logical 
order, (2) to indicate their approximate dates 
and the classes of writers from which they 
come, and the more important reasons for the 
critical analysis of the different books, and (3) 
to introduce the reader by means of a clear 
translation to the beauty and thought of the 
original, ' with notes of interpretation, and 
other notations to make clear the thought of 
the original. The introduction is a compre- 
hensive discussion of the traditions of Israel, 
their transmission, and their crystallization into 
literature. It is with this literature that the 
author deals; and consequently he must assign 
each document to its proper time and place in 
Israel's history. The body of the book presents 
in parallel columns, where more than one story 
of an event exists, the text of the required 
narratives. By a subtle acxunen the texts have 
been separated and thrown into parallels, or 
otherwise, to give the popular reader a true 
idea of the supposed sources of the narratives 
of the books covered by this volume. The 
appendix supplies a full-enough bibliography, 
characteristics of the narratives, and several 
translations of Babylonian stories parallelled in 
thought to Genesis. The author is to be con- 
gratulated on the completion of so colossal a 
task, and Bible students on such a complete 
crystallization of the present status of the 
literary and historical criticism of the early 
narratives of the Old Testatment. 

The work of the Eev. J. C. Todd on ' Politics 
and Eeligion in Ancient Israel ' is another pop- 
ular treatment of Old Testament literature. 
The author's rough-and-ready style, his ten- 
dency to rid himself of hackneyed methods of 
writing and of trite statements, give a fresh 
flavor to a work of this kind. He has a new 
angle of vision, from which he often gives his 
readers a pleasing view of the situation. His 
opening statement is, ' The Old Testament is 
the epos of the Fall of Jerusalem '(p. 1.). 
Around this event the author's interest centres, 
as he drives his pen through the Old Testament 
from Genesis to Malachi. The book is full of 
statements, familiar to scholars in this field, 
but startling and even reactionary to some lay- 
men in Bible Study. The author seems to take 
it for granted that his words require no proof, 
that his ipse dixit is final to his readers. This 
method may be necessary for condensation, but 
to be conclusive it should be provided either 
with references as proofs, or with somewhat 
larger elaboration of the topics discussed. One 
of the contentions of the book is that Israel 



was but one of the nations of antiquity, and 
that ' the religion of Israel is one of the bases 
on which the modern world rests' (p. 308). 
Israel's contribution to humanity is an ethical 
religion, as based on the records of the Scrip- 
tures. The New Testament is not the beginning 
of ethics and theology ; every page of it carries 
us back to the Old. ' It is no paradox to say 
that in one sense the New Testament is simply 
a foot note to the Old, telling us that every- 
thing there written is to be understood of our 
Lord Jesus Christ. . . . He is the suffering 
Servant Israel, and he is Israel's Messianic 
Bang; he is the Temple, the sacrificial Victim, 
the High Priest. In a word, the New Testa- 
ment is the Book of God made man; and that 
God is the God already revealed in the whole 
political and social nexus of the time ' (p. 310) . 
The theme is one rich with thought, and awaits 
a full and adequately equipped discussion that 
will convincingly carry with it the mind of 
the honest truth-seeking student of the Bible. 
The Psalms are the most universally revered 
portions of the Old Testament. They are mir- 
rors 0- the human soul, and hence touch man 
in almost every experience in life. Their 
thought is not limited to any age, nation, or 
religious creed. They have been highly prized 
for their spiritual inspiration, by individuals, 
by religious societies, by armies, and by nations, 
for many centuries. They have been material 
for thought, for extensive speaking and writ- 
ing, and for the most determined and vigorous 
action when required. The distinguished 
author of ' The Psalms in Human Life,' Mr. 
Eowland E, Prothero, has been in no hurry to 
publish his book, for his activity in collecting 
the material for it has extended over more than 
twenty-five years. His plan of work was, for 
example, to gather from the most distinguished 
church fathers all the hints and direct state- 
ments that would in any way bear on the 
Psalms. Passing from this period, he takes up 
the same items touching the formation of the 
nations. The middle ages, the reformation era, 
the struggle between Protestant England and 
Eoman Catholic Spain, the Huguenots, the 
Puritans, the Scottish Covenanters, and the 
revolution of 1688, are periods and movements 
that called to the front some of the richest 
spirits and the sturdiest spiritual characters 
that the world has produced. These giant 
fighters for truth have made frequent and large 
use of the choicest of the Psalms, both for their 
own personal encouragement and for the inspir- 
ation of their valorous supporters. The author 
has carefully gathered the facts from a great 
mass of history and literature, and has deftly 
woven them into a bit of delightful narrative.

Patrick Gass, America]^ Explorer.* 

The name of Patrick Gass has never been 
written high in the list of American authors. 
What little fame he did acquire through the 
publication of his Journal, written while a ser- 
geant on the Lewis and Clark expedition, was 
likely to perish when the book long since disap- 
peared from print. A reprint of the diary of 
the hardy frontiersman has now been made, 
happily supplementing the recent republication 
of the complete official journal of the expedi- 
tion by the same publishers, Messrs. A. C. 
McClurg & Co. Placed side by side, the two 
accounts of the incidents of the famous jour- 
ney exactly fit into each other. The one is writ- 
ten from the standpoint of the scientific 
explorers who headed the column, and the other 
from tliat of the rank and file. 

From the excellent Introduction to the vol- 
ume, written by Mr. James K. Hosmer, one 
gathers that Patrick Gass, by descent a son of 
old Ireland, was a carpenter by trade, whom 
adversity or choice had driven into our regular 
army. When Captain Lewis was making up 
the quota of select spirits to accompany him in 
his quest of a northwestern route to the Pacific, 
he included Private Gass, then stationed 
at the L^nited States government post 
near Kaskaskia, chiefly because of his 
skill with the broadaxe. Since the party 
took no tents and expected to spend 
one or two winters on the journey, the advis- 
ability of including some artisan experienced in 
hewing and joining timbers was not to be over- 
looked. Gass was the last man chosen for the 
expedition, and probably the oldest member of 
it except Captain Clark. Yet he was only thirty- 
two! Young ])lood was needed for such 
adventurous work. 

Gass was not an educated man. No doubt 
his notes, as taken on the long road, were far 
enough from the style in which they appeared 
in print. For this polishing, a Mr. McKeehan 
must be given credit. The official journals of 
the expedition were edited by Paul Allen. 
Gass's Journal appeared in type in 1807, ante- 
dating the publication of the official records by 
several years. 

The Introduction to the present reprint gives 
some description of the various subordinates in 

♦Gass's Journal of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. 
Reprinted from the edition of 1811. With Introduction 
by James Kendall Hosmer, LL.D. Chicago : A. C. 
McClurg & Co. 



the expedition, and of their subsequent careers 
as far as investigators have been able to trace 
them. Gass, who had risen to the rank of ser- 
geant while on the expedition, saw service in the 
War of 1812, then became a jack-of-all-trades 
of intemperate habits, married at sixty, fathered 
seven children, and died as late as 1870, at the 
age of ninety-nine. His career has been often 
parallelled. It is the story of the courageous 
and hardy frontiersman, strong in everything 
except personal control. 

In some respects, the general reader will pre- 
fer the descriptions of Gass to the official rec- 
ords. Gass never made those long excursions 
into the fields of natural history which the 
nature of the expedition required from its lead- 
ers. He never troubled himself with long 
descriptions of the various unknown animals 
captured or killed, or the peculiar and interest- 
ing plants found. He is concerned with stray 
horses, annoyed by parted tow-lines, and 
'nearly devoured alive' by mosquitoes. Tar must 
be made for pitching the boats, and salt must 
be procured from the savages or boiled from 
springs or ocean water; the heavy game which 
the hunters killed must be carried to camp, and 
the wet baggage must frequently be unloaded 
and dried or carried over portages. This was 
the work which fell to Sergeant Gass and his 
fellows. Small leisure was afforded them for 
scientific investigations. 

Frequently the Lewis and Clark records men- 
tiqn how uncomplainingly the men bore their 
privations. The cheerful tone of Sergeant Gass 
under the most trying circumstances is evident. 
When there was food, they feasted; when there 
was none, they fasted. At one time, the natives 
assured the whites that they had not more roots 
and provisions than they themselves needed, but 
they drove up some horses to be shot. After 
killing one, they were offered another. ' That 
was reserved,' says Gass, * until another time, 
and we dressed the one we had killed; and in 
our situation we find it very good eating.' 
Camping one night in a rain which turned to 
snow, they found themselves next morning 
' lying in the plains, the snow about five inches 
deep; and amidst snow and frost, we have noth- 
ing to eat. Without breakfast, we started to 
go to a village of natives, who live on a branch 
of the river.' On another occasion, ' Our stock 
of provisions is exhausted, and we have nothing 
but some roots, which we get from the natives 
at a very dear rate.' When one of the number 
fell sick, Captain Lewis was ' obliged to bleed 
him with a penknife, having no other instru- 
ment at this camp.' 

Never were the hardships of tlie explorers 
too great, or the anxiety about their situation 
too keen, to prevent their Americanism showing 
itself, especially on the national holidays. On

July -i of the fii-^t year up the Missouri, Ga&s 
made the following entry in his journal : 

'Wednesday ith. We fired a swivel at sunrise 
in honour of the clay and continued the voyage; 
passed a creek on the north side, called Pond 
Creek, and at one o'clock stopt to dine. One of 
our people got snake bitten, but not dangerously. 
After dinner we renewed our voyage, passed a 
creek on the north side, which we called INDE- 
PENDENCE, encamped on the north side at an 
old Indian village situated in a handsome prairie 
and saluted the departing day with another gun.' 

Friday, November 15, 1805, was memorable. 
The official scribes should have been inspired to 
make long entries on that day, because the party 
then came in full view of the Pacific Ocean, at 
the mouth of the Columbia River, establishing 
a fresh claim to the great Oregon country. But 
in tlie abominable weather, and surrounded by 
thieving Indians, the leaders were not moved 
to raptures. Gass is even more matter of fact. 
He records: 

'Friday 15th. This morning the weather appeared 
to settle and clear off, but the river remained 
still rough. So we were obliged to continue here

Patrick was faithful to the end in his diary. 
His last entry records the triumphal reception 
of the returned travelers at St. Louis, Septem-

says, 'and were received with great kindness 
and marks of friendship by the inhabitants, 
after an absence of two years, four months and 
ten days.' The record of the adventurous Ser-

A Mediaeval Prixcess. * 

' Jacqueline of Bavaria ' is a name that acts 
like the dew of heaven upon the dryest Dutch 
chronicles. At once they bud and blossom, and 
what seemed but a desert is ' with sudden herb- 
age crowned.' In Dutch art and literature, 
and on the stage, Jacoba van Beijeren looms a 
mighty figure against the backgrounds of ro- 
mance. In English chronicles she is ' Dame 
Jake,' and tlie modern Englishman's chapter of 
alleged research becomes a comedy of errors 
when this Countess of Borselen is transformed 
into a glorified queen of the keramic art. The 
gordion knot of contradictory derivations of a 
word uncertain in its origin is cut at once, and

' Borselen ' furnishes the original of ' porce- 
lain.' 

Miss Eutli Putnam, whose position in the 
Dutch scholarship of the English-speaking 
world is unique, is not led away by romance or 
tradition. She keeps amazingly cool while 
exploring that mediaeval age in which few mod- 
ern breezes of opinion blow, and where, save 
in the pulses and expression of the same human 
heart, there is little to remind one of our age of 
steel and coal, of machinery and the telegraph. 
Very little of admiration and not over-much of 
sympathy, but clear insight and determination 
to get at the reality, are the hall-marks of the 
author's scholarly work. On some pages it 
almost seems as though she purposely refrains 
from being as interesting as she might, lest 
enthusiasm should possibly lend prismatic 
tints to her achromatic critical lenses. Never- 
theless the text is brisk, and the story moves 
brightly forward; while for anyone with much 
power of imagination to construct her environ- 
ment in the past, the narrative makes delight- 
ful reading. 

As Jacqueline had four husbands, she suf- 
fered a proportionate degree of trouble; yet it 
was not her marital companions that laid on her 
the heaviest burdens. Beside having a decided 
will of her own, she had much misery and little 
enjoyment from her great possessions of land 
and her numerous titles; for both these assets, 
in a rude age of force, excited the cupidity of 
her relatives. To read their letters, one would 
suppose them to be the most affectionate and 
unselfish creatures in the world ; but beneath 
their purring lay ever the beak and talons. 
Thus this mediaeval princess wore a thorny 
crown of sorrows during most of her short life. 
Her career was run in much less than the first 
iialf of the fifteenth century. Born in 1401, at 
The Hague, she was thus the Daughter of Hol- 
land, and as such was the acknowledged and 
sole heir to her father, the Count, William the 
Sixth, — for neither then nor until Napoleon's 
day did Holland ever have any kings, and even 
in this disguised republic Dutch sovereigns of 
to-day wear no crown. Married, when little 
more than a child, to a youthful prince who was 
early poisoned, she took a second husband in 
1418; but separating from him, her case was 
referred to the divorce court at Rome. This 
being the time of a change in the Papacy, the 
case dragged for several years, while she both 
wooed and was wooed by an Englishman, being 
alternately loved and deserted by the insular 
Duke who was no other than Humphrey, whose 
library is still at Oxford, a delightful home of 
books. He it was who ' magnified ' the Uni- 
versity of Oxford ' with a thousand pounds 
worth and more of precious bokes ' (129 in num- 
ber). When Christendom's chief divorcer decided

against Jacqueline, she became the Countess 
Militant; and between the Cods and Hooks, 
leading her soldiers in battle and besieging and 
being besieged, while supporting the lost cause, 
she was a picturesque figure. She finally mar- 
ried her ' silent partner,' the Lord of Borselen, 
owner of a petty feudal patch of land in Zee- 
land. As to title, she became Lady Forester, 
with enough income to live merrily during the 
happiest of her marriages. She lived at the 
same time with Jeanne d'Arc, and fought 
against and was finally conquered by the same 
men who burned one of these two women and 
robbed the other. The peasant has been suffi- 
ciently glorified. It is time the princess should 
be better known in the English-speaking world. 
One scarcely knows which to praise more, the 
patient scholarship or the attractive style of the 
author; the theme of the personality here pre- 
sented, or the picture and suggestions of the 
feudal age, looking into which this book uncur- 
tains so many windows, and upon which it 
opens such pleasing vistas. Yet romantic and 
fascinating as were many of the elements mak- 
ing up mediaeval feudalism, this book makes 
one feel occasionally like falling on one's knees 
in thankfulness that feudalism is dead and gone 
forever. Altogether this story of a too-pro- 
tected female is really more interesting in its 
last, perhaps its final, historical setting than in 
most of the romantic presentations of which we 
have had already too many. The book, besides 
being attractive as to contents, style, illustra- 
tions, and general equipment, seems to be almost 
perfect in its proof-reading.

Kecent Books of Travel.* 



The first book on our present list is one of 
the most important works on Africa that have 
been published since Stanley wrote his masterly 
work on the dark continent. Major A. St. H. 
Gibbons, who now holds the premier place as 
an explorer of Africa, entitles his two volumes 
'Africa from South to North through Marot-

seland.' It is a pleasure to say that while Major 
Gibbons's book is hardly in the same class as 
Stanley's most notable work, it has many excel- 
lent features. It has good pictures, a number 
of well-made and intelligible maps, a good pre- 
face and introductory chapter, and several well- 
prepared appendices giving a summar}' of the 
important results of the expedition under the 
author's leadership, — such as England's share 
in African development, the natural resources 
and the industrial and commercial conditions 
of Africa that fit it for colonization, the good 
and the evil of missionary work there, and the 
administrative systems in operation. The 
author dedicates his work to the late Cecil 
Rhodes, who requested the explorer to make a 
special study of the Zambezi country in order to 
determine the most desirable crossing of that 
river for the great Cape to Cairo Railway. To 
revert to the organization of the expedition, it is 
interesting to note how thoroughly Major Gib- 
bons was equipped. In order to test the naviga- 
bility of the African rivers, he had two alum- 
inum launches and a barge in sections made; 
and with these he continued the exploration of 
the Lower Zambezi, going eight hundred miles 
to the nearest attainable point to Victoria Falls. 
Although Major Gibbons took the utmost care 
in selecting his company, he seems to have been 
followed by ill luck, losing four of his six white 
companions, and being constantly harassed by 
the desertions of his native boys. Yet, with a 
cheerful determination to ignore such hin- 
drances, he pushed on, following the Zambezi 
to its source, ' the water oozing from a black 
spongy bog,' which had previously remained 
undiscovered, and forced his way along the 
Congo-Zambezi Watershed eastward through 
much unexplored country, until he fell in with 
a Congo State expedition, in whose company 
he journeyed to a station in Katanga. From 
there he traversed the countries contingent to 
Lakes Mweru, Tanganyika, Kivo, Albert 
Edward, Victoria Nyanza to the Nile, and 
thence to Khartum. There is much that is 
unusually interesting and instructive in the 
work, but we must confine ourselves to a single 
quotation, relative to the commercial prospects 
of Uganda and Marotseland. Of these two 
countries. Major Gibbons says : 

' Excluding the small district comprising Lake 
Kivo, two countries, more than all others, have 
struck me as offering the best prospects for Euro- 
pean settlement. I refer to Uganda and Marotse- 
land. Both contain large plateaus, ranging from 
thirty-five hundred to five thousand feet, and both 
are capable of growing many useful products on an 
extensive scale. Marotseland will grow cereals of 
various kinds, as well as rice, cotton, sugar, and 
rubber, to say nothing of fruits, which with sugar 
at a reasonable price could very easily be made the 
basis of an industry capable of competing with 
California in the rapidly growing South African

market, and of supplying jam at a higlily profitable 
rate. Cattle do better in this country than in any 
other part of Africa within my experience, and will 
amply reward a little enterprise. The rich undula- 
tions of Uganda seem to me especially adaptable to 
wheat-growing on a large scale.' 

Of course the one thing necessary to the 
development of these countriesi is the completion 
of the Cape to Cairo Railway, nearly half of 
which is now finished. To those who relish 
tales of adventure in African wilds, this book 
oifers many accounts of thrilling incidents with 
natives, lions, elephants, and buffaloes. 

While Africa has had eminent explorers like 
Stanley and Gibbons to write about it, the 
Orient has been less adequately described. 
There is considerable assumption in the title of 
Mr. Michael M. Shoemaker's latest book, ' The 
Heart of the Orient,' yet we think it is quite 
justified by the contents of the work. The 
author describes a journey from Constantinople 
through the quaint and curious kingdom of 
Georgia, now a part of the Eussian empire, 
thence through Armenia, Persia, Turkomania, 
and Turkestan, to the Vale of Paradise, and 
gives vivid and satisfying pictures of the peo- 
ple, from the high life at the Persian court to 
the low life in the tents of the Kirghez, ' where 
the camels whispered bits of gossip from 
Ispahan and Bactra, and the donkeys still dream 
of the flight into Egypt,' The author has, 
moreover, entered sufficiently into the history 
of the various countries to make the way plain 
for the reader. We read with interest of the 
reign of good Queen Tamara of Georgia ; of the 
survival of the stolid-faced Armenians through 
the successive persecutions of the Arabian 
Caliphs, the Moguls, the Persians, the Turks, 
and the Russians; of the wonderful Peacock 
throne of Persia; of the Trans-Caspian rail- 
way ; of Samarkand, the poem of the Orient ; of 
Bokhara, with itsi barbaric splendor and squa- 
lor; and, finally, of Russia's management of 
these far-away strands. The following excer])t 
— a picture of Samarkand — will reveal the 
quality of the book : 

* Here comes an old man — on the inevitable 
donkey — wrapped in a garment of heavy crimson, 
brocaded with flaring yellow figures, while from 
his head rises a turban of green and gold that would 
make a Western man totter, but he sits erect. The 
heels of his pointed red slippers are pressed closely 
into the little beast that carries him forward with 
a steady trot. Yonder a group of turbaned mer- 
chants are closely inspecting a consignment from 
China by the great caravan routes. The patient 
camels that have toiled for so many months under 
its weight are asleep beneath the trees. Veiled 
women pass chattering along on patient donkeys. 
Sedate-looking storks gaze down upon us from their 
ancestral nests high on the leaning minerets. It is 
the Orient pure and simple, and, so far, unpolluted 
by the tourist element.' 

Mr. Shoemaker has caught the breath and spirit 



of the Orient, and described it in a manner that 
is at once easy and well-poised. 

From the Orient to the Occident is a long 
jump, even in a review; but there are parts of 
our own country that are almost as little known 
as Persia. Ever since the first explorers crossed 
the Rocky Mountains, the Great American 
Desert, with its strange, picturesque, mysterious 
scenery, has had a fascinating and romantic 
interest. ISotwithstanding it has been so often 
and so well described, there is still room for Mr. 
Arthur J. Burdick's volume having the title 
(suggestively taken from Poe's ' Ulalume ' ) 
' The Mystic Mid-Region.' Mr. Burdick 
has himself come under the spell of the vast 
desert spaces, and imparts much of their weird- 
ness and charm to the readers of hie book. He 
tells of their wonders, their dangere and hard- 
ships, and the possibilities of their reclamation, 
with no little narrative skill. Speculations as 
to their origin and history; tales of suffering 
from thirst in these waterless tracts; descrip- 
tions of desert plants and animals, and of the 
aborigines who, apparently by some slip in the 
law of life, dwell there; stories of venturesome 
prospectors in search of the ' yellow streak, ' 
with many other things, make up the contents 
of this interesting book. The following descrip- 
tion of Death Valley, in the Mohave Desert in 
California, gives a touch of the quality of the 
book: 

' Death Valley has an area of nearly five hun- 
dred square miles. It is fifty miles long, and varies 
in width from five to ten miles. Its greatest depres- 
sion is 480 feet below sea-level. In this limited 
area, more men have perished than upon any other 
similar area in the world, the great battle-fields 
excepted. The remarkable mineral wealth of the 
region has been glittering bait to lure men to 
destruction. There are in the valley golden ledges, 
the ores of which run in value to fabulous sums 
per ton. There are vast beds of nitre, soda, salt, 
and other mineral drugs. There is a single salt- 
field in the valley, thirty miles long and from two 
to four miles wide, where salt lies a foot or more 
deep over the entire field. Turquoises, opals, gar- 
nets, onyx, marbles, and other gems and rocks of 
value, exist in abundance. The valley is a store- 
house of wealth, the treasure-vault of the nation, 
the drug-store of the universe; but Death holds the 
title.' 

Mr. Burdick asserts, however, that irrigation 
will reclaim much of this arid region to the 
uses of man. 

The title of Mr. David T. Hanbury's book, 
• Sport and Travel in the Northland of Canada,* 
is somewhat misleading, for it suggests the 
common type of travel-book that tells of wander- 
ings in search of adventure and oddities in out- 
of-the-way places; whereas the book is really a 
compendium of scientific research in the far 
Xorth of Canada. Mr. Hanbury spent twenty 
months in this almost terra incognita, concern- 
ing which he writes : 



274 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



' I have always maintained that ' * Barren 
Ground " is a misnomer for the Northland of Can- 
ada. No land can be called barren which bears wild- 
flowers in profusion, numerous heaths, luxuriant 
grass, in places up to the knees, and a variety of 
moss and lichens. It is barren only in the sense 
that it is destitute of trees; hence the name 
De-chin-u-le (no trees) which is the Indian name 
for it.' 

In Mr. Hanbury, the Eskimos have found a 
friend. He has high praise for their integrity 
and honesty, but he has scant praise for the 
Indians, whom he found to be utterly untrust- 
worthy. The value of the book is enhanced by 
a good introductory historical sketch of explora- 
tion in North Canada, by Mr. J. P. Eenwick, 
and also by several appendices giving scientific 
data on the geology, the flora and fauna, the 
weather conditions, measurements of Hudson 
Bay Eskimo, and an Eskimo word-and-phrase 
list. It is to be regretted that a book so well 
printed and profusely illustrated, and giving so 
much fresh information, should be written in so 
crude and unentertaining a manner. 

An ideal way to see a foreign country is to 
jaunt through it in some sort of easy-going 
vehicle. Apparently the stolkjaere of Norway, 
'a two- wheel pony cart, the body of which is 
hung, very high, with a commodious seat for 
two passengers and a raised perch-like seat 
behind the passengers' seat for the driver or 
skydgui,' is not the worst riding-cart in the 
world. In such a cart, two men, one a modest 
Eambler and the other an austere Doctor of 
Laws, made a jolly tour in Southwestern Nor- 
way in August and September, months when 
the regular tourists, especially the German and 
the English species, had gone home; and now 
the Rambler recounts the trips in a readable 
way in a little book entitled 'A Norwegian 
Ramble. He tells us that the two travellers 
' crossed the country twice, once northwest to 
Molde, our farthest point north, and then down 
the coast, and in and out of the wonderful 
fjords, and finally southeast again through the 
beautiful Valdeas to the capital of this strangely 
fascinating country ; and in all our joumeyings 
we never experienced aught from the natives but 
the greatest of courtesy, kindness, and hospital- 
ity.' Next to this uniform hospitality, the 
travellers were most struck by the unusual 
silence prevailing in the land. During their 
entire journey they did not hear the sound of 
bird or squirrel, and of very few dogs ; and they 
saw but few pigs and' roostens. Perhaps the 
Norwegians are strangely quiet, too; for there 
is no record in the book of conversation with 
them, — the one thing the volume needs to 
enliven it. On the whole, however, it furnishes 
a sketchy account of an interesting jaunt made 
by two congenial men. 

The sub-title of Mr. Frederick A. Ober's book 



on ' Our West Indian Neighbors ' runs as fol- 
lows: 'The islands of the Caribbean Sea, 
America's Mediterranean, their picturesque 
features, fascinating history, and attractions for 
the traveler, nature-lover, settler, and pleasure- 
seeker.' A title so comprehensive calls, for 
much in the way of fulfilment ; but the volume 
seems to justify it. Mr. Ober's knowledge of 
affairs and conditions in the West Indies is 
extensive and minute. As a collector of birds 
and an adventurer in the islands in 1879-80, as 
Commissioner to the W^orld's Fair from the 
West Indies in 1891, and as a visitor subsequent 
to the recent war, Mr. Ober has had unusual 
opportunities and advantages for obtaining 
first-hand information, and sufficient time for 
studying the exact conditions of our island 
neighbors in that quarter. The volume is not 
limited to Cuba and Puerto Rico, but includes 
all the important islands even to the Barbadoes 
and Trinidad, treating the inhabitants, the 
climate, the commercial and industrial features, 
the sights of town and country, and the local 
and foreign governments, of each. As our 
interest in the islands is largely commercial, the 
concluding words of Mr. Ober in his book are 
pertinent : 

' There is no denying the fact that, with the 
exception of Cuba and Puerto Eico, possibly of 
Trinidad, the West Indian islands have retrograded 
in the past century. They have grown poorer, the 
British islands especially, their population blacker, 
hence they are less desirable as places of residence 
for white folk.' 

We close our present list of travel-books with 
a consideration of the Rev. Dr. W. W. Moore's 
' A Year in Europe.' As Dr. Moore went 
through Europe with his eye mainly on its 
religious sights and aspects, this view-point is 
prominent in the book, and gives it a certain 
interest and novelty. With him, we visit South- 
ampton, not for the interest of William the 
Conqueror or Richard the Lion Hearted, but 
for the interest of the great hymn-writer Dr. 
Watts; we go to Winchester, not because of 
Alfred the Great, but on account of that 
aggressive churchman Thomas Ken; we see 
Cambridge and Oxford, not as great universi- 
ties, but as great churches ; W^estminster Abbey 
appeals to us as the home of the Shorter Cate- 
chism ; in Rome we miss the pagan gloria, but 
we are edified by a discourse on the relics of the 
Roman Catholic church. Even if we cannot 
agree with Dr. Moore in all his views and asser- 
tions, we can find good topics for discussion in 
his pages. For example, when, after noting the 
l>eauties of the English cathedrals, he says that 
' If at the Reformation every cathedral in 
Groat Britain had been pounded to pieces by 
the iconoclasts, it would have been an immeas- 
urable calamity to art, but it might have been

a real gain to religion; at any rate, it is 
ritualism rather than religion that is now pro- 
moted by the cathedrals/ we feel as if the ques- 
tion is at least an open one. Yet we must give 
the author due credit by adding that in general 
his statements' are not heavily marked by 
uncharitable sectarianism. For those who 
would see Europe in its 'dim religious light/ 
the volume wiU be instructive and entertaining.

Briefs on Netv Books. 



The story of the Historians have long understood 
courtships of that the unique position of Eliza- 
Queen Elizabeth, ^jgth Tudor as a queen without a 
consort was a matter of great consequence to 
her kingdom and to the rest of Europe as well; 
but not till recently have they fully appreciated 
the value of the fact as a diplomatic asset. Eight 
years ago, Mr. Martin Hmne, of the Public 
Record Commission in England, published an 
extended work in which he traced with great 
minuteness the progress of all the various nego- 
tiations for the queen's hand through a period 
of more than twenty-five years. During this 
period, every marriageable Christian prince 
seems to have been proposed as a fit consort, 
only to be more or less speedily rejected. The 
negotiations ceased with the death of Alen§on in 
1584; *the farce of marriage' could be played no 
longer, as there was now no available prince in 
sight. The author views the subject mainly from 
the diplomatic side; he is interested chiefly in 
tracing the effect of these negotiations on the 
policies and politics of the time. It will be 
readily seen that in forming and dissolving alli- 
ances the European princes would be strongly 
influenced by the prospect of winning the hand 
of the English queen, which prospect was kept 
continually before their eyes. Many were dis- 
appointed, however, in flnding that the personal 
side of these projects was not considered in Mr. 
Hume's book, and clamored for a more complete 
treatment. The author has yielded to this 
demand, and has recently published a revised 
edition of his work tmder its old title, 'The 
Courtships of Queen Elizabeth' (McClure, Phil- 
lips & Co.), but with two supplementary chap- 
ters which carry the narrative on through the 
queen's old age to the downfall of Essex in 1601. 
In these he discusses her attitude toward her 
various suitors and later favorites, and attempts 
to show to what extent she was dominated by 
the gentler passions. Mr. Hume's picture of 
Elizabeth the woman is decidedly interesting; 
while sensible to the fact that she possessed 
many qualities of the less lovable order, he does 
not find her so unwomanly as she is usually 
thought to be. There was much in lier conduct 
that will always be severely censured; but on the 
graver charges against her character, the author, 
after examining all the existing evidence, delivers 
a verdict of 'not proven.' 



Theioeather The weather is one of the most 
as influencing interesting topics of conversation. 
human conduct, if ^ue may believe the daily evi^ 
denee of his ears. It has also caused the writ- 
ing of many books. One of the latest of these 
is entitled 'Weather Influences,' and comes from 
the pen of Prof. Edwin G. Dexter, of the 
University of Illinois, and the press of Mao- 
millan. In order to arouse the reader's interest, 
the author has devoted the first four chapters 
of his book to weather lore. The moon, comets, 
stars, meteors, and all sorts of meteorological 
appearances in the sky, are popularly supposed 
to be available for making prognostications con- 
cerning the weather. Cats, squirrels, opossums, 
and other animals, are thought to furnish by 
their actions clues to coming changes of weather. 
Standard literature teems with references to the 
effects of meteorological conditions upon the 
emotions and actions of man himself. Professor 
Dexter, believing that there must be some scien- 
tific foundation for the apparent modification of 
man's conduct by variations of the weather, has 
made a special study of various data which 
throw light upon the subject. Such were reports 
of school deportment, and records of the police 
courts giving accounts of murders, suicides, 
cases of assault and battery, and of drunk- 
enness. There were also available statistics 
about deaths, insanity, and disorders of various 
kinds, including even clerical errors in banks. 
These were obtained largely from the cities of 
New York and Denver, the separate occurrences 
bemg over 600,000 in number. They were com- 
pared with the observations of barometric pres- 
sure, temperature, humidity, wind-movement, etc., 
made at the U. S. Weather Bureau stations in 
those cities. Perhaps the most . interesting of 
the conclusions drawn are that the reserve energy 
capable of being utilized for intellectual pur- 
poses is affected most by meteorological changes, 
and that those weather conditions which are espe- 
cially associated with misconduct are also pro- 
ductive of health and of mental alertness. School- 
teachers must therefore expect to have their 
tempers especially tried on those days which are 
most invigorating. The results of Professor Dex- 
ter 's laborious tabulations and comparisons are 
made plain to the eye by the plotting of curves 
m the usual fashion. We may say in conclusion 
that the author has made a creditable incursion 
into a field of research where it is generally 
quite difficult to draw satisfactory conclusions. 



Chapters on

Professor Thomas Marc Par- 
rott, of Princeton, republishes 
three of his recent literary 
essays, adding five new ones, and naming the col- 
lection 'Studies of a Booklover' (James Pott & 
Co.). In his opening chapter, on Matthew Arn- 
old, he asserts that 'it is by his poetry that the 
place of Matthew Arnold in English literature 
will in the end be determined'; and then follows 
an admiring and admirable study of this 'most 
classic of the Victorian poets.' 'The Autobiog- 
raphy of Milton' is not the announcement of a 
newly discovered Milton manuscript, but an out- 
line of the poet's life based on certain autobid-

graphic fragments scattered through his works. 
The suggestion is offered that a fairly complete 
biography of Milton might be made by reprinting 
these fragments in full, and that such a method 
would perhaps portray the poet more vividly 
than does Professor Masson's great work, where 
Milton is sometimes lost in a crowd of contem- 
poraries. In 'The Frugal Note of Gray' the 
writer discards Matthew Arnold's list of quali- 
ties constituting a poet's equipment, and boldly 
essays to define them anew, — a harmless amuse- 
ment in which many before him have indulged. 
In his essay on Dr. Johnson, the author finds 
the great man 's prose style deficient * in the 
weightier matters, such as invention, humor, and 
power of characterization.' Ponderosity does 
indeed belong to Johnson's humor, which sug- 
gests the gambols of a megatherium, but hardly 
to humor at its best. * The Charm of Goldsmith ' 
is well found to reside in his childlikeness. 'The 
Vitality of Browning' is dwelt upon as charac- 
teristic of the man; but when it is asserted that 
* though in the world he was not of it,' possibly 
a. murmur of dissent will arise from those who 
noted in the poet's lifetime his fondness for 
smart society. Scott, and Robert Fergusson, the 
ill-starred poet of Edinburgh, are the subjects 
each of an entertaining chapter. The appear- 
ance of the volume, in print, illustrations, and 
binding, deserves ' a closing word of praise. 



An analysis Herbert Spencer's Autobiography 

and study of has given a special impetus to 

Herbert Spencer, ^^y^qj. writings on the same sub- 
ject, both biographical and critical. Prof. Josiah 
Royce uses the work as a convenient basis for an 
analytical study of Spencer's contribution to the 
concept of Evolution. As an essay on this dis- 
tinct subject, including a history of the idea of 
evolution before Spencer's time, a review of the 
origin, development, and limitations of Spencer's 
theory, and a statement of the present idea of 
Evolution, Mr. Royce 's book is illuminating. 
Spencer based his philosophy largely on a self- 
constructed definition, the faults and incomplete- 
ness of which Mr. Royce easily points out, at the 
same time showing how these faults made pre- 
cision in Spencer's philosophy impossible. In a 
supplementary essay on 'Spencer's Theories of 
Education,' which, together with a chapter of 
personal reminiscences by Herbert Spencer's 
assistant, Mr. James Collier, complete the vol- 
ume. Mr. Royce employs the same analytical 
methods in reference to Spencer's popular series 
of essays on Education, with much the same 
results. There is probably no statement in either 
essay which is not just and accurate; yet the 
book has little claim to its sub- title, 'An Esti- 
mate and a Review.' No estimate of Spencer's 
work is correct which does not lay stress on the 
marvellous bridge of organized thought which 
Spencer built, on the relationships which he 
^tablished between the various sciences, on the 
inspiration which he has been to a large and 
influential school of younger men, on all that he 
did rather than on what he failed to do, on the 
much in which he was right, rather than on the 



little in which, thanks largely to his own efforts 
in stating the problems, we are able to prove him 
wrong or incomplete. We believe that Professor 
Royce himself would scarcely call these two 
slight essays his final estimate of Herbert Spen- 
cer's contribution to the thought of nations. 
(Fox, Duffield & CoO 

Histories of the To write the history of South 
South American American Republics is a large 
Republics. undertaking; and in attempting 

it for the 'Story of the Nations' series (Put- 
nam) Mr. Thomas C. Dawson has wisely devoted 
two volumes to the subject. The first of these, 
setting forth the history of Argentina, Paraguay, 
Uraguay, and Brazil, the countries upon the 
Atlantic coast of the southern continent, received 
notice in these columns a few months ago. For 
the second volume was reserved an account of 
the Republics upon the Gulf and Pacific coasts. 
By far the greater historic interest attaches to 
these, including what we know as the Conquest 
of Peru, the Spanish colonies and vireinates, the 
wars for independence of Spain out of which 
emerged Peru, Chile, Bolivia, Ecuador, Venezuela, 
and Columbia, and the gradual development in 
these of something like constitutional govern- 
ment. In spite of the difficulties in the way of 
adequately treating these countries in limited 
space, we have in this second volimae an admir- 
able account of them, written more especially 
in view of the economic relations which will 
undoubtedly accrue to the United States from 
the building of the Panama Canal. The publica- 
tion of this second volume was evidently with- 
held until it could contain an account of the new 
Republic of Panama. The chapter devoted to 
that subject, though brief, is informing. The 
illustrations in the book are interesting, and the 
three maps with which it is furnished are very 
valuable. Altogether, Mr. Dawson has brought, 
in his two volumes, the South American nations 
within the range of popular historical study. 



The mind 
and religion 
of Whittier. 



The year has seen an unusual 
number of Whittier biographies 
and studies, not the least pleas- 
ing of which is Mr. Chauneey J. Hawkins's little 
volume on 'The Mind of Whittier' (Whittaker). 
As the ' title-page announces, and as the author- 
ship would lead one to expect, — for Mr. Haw- 
kins is a clergyman, — it is the 'fundamental 
religious ideas' of the Quaker poet that are here 
treated. His 'inner life,' his optimism, his 
sympathy with nature and the lessons he draws 
from her manifold aspects, his belief in the divin- 
ity of Jesus (for Whittier was no Hicksite), his 
hope of a future life, — all these subjects are 
handled as only a true lover and student of Whit- 
tier's verse could handle them, with frequent 
illustrative extracts from the poems. The author 
is inclined to think 'as many religious ideas 
come from the poets as from ' the Bible ' ; and no 
one who has a spark of poetry in his soul, and 
who bears in mind how much of the Bible is 
itself poetry, will dispute him. We 'are reminded, 
and comforted by the remembrance, that with 
all Whittier 's trust in the Eternal Goodness he

was by no means unharassed by doubt or unper- 
plexed by difficult problems, 'the same old baf- 
fling questions,' which he made no pretense of 
answering. That he is to-day the poet most fre- 
quently quoted in our pulpits, and that his appeal 
to the religious instincts is far stronger than that 
of Longfellow, Emerson, Lowell, or Bryant, is an 
assertion few will contest. Mr. Hawkins's appre- 
ciative study of the dominant element in Whit- 
tier's verse will send Whittier-lovers back to 
their poet with renewed zest. A misprint that 
maj^ perplex some is found in Mrs. Claflin's 
name, which appears as ' Chaflin, ' and in Mr. 
Stedman's, which masquerades as 'Steadman.' 

Indian life .Under the same editorial auspices 
in town and as that of ' Our European Neigh- 
in country. bors' series, and having the same 
publishers (Putnam), a series of 'Our Asiatic 
Neighbors' now begins, its initial volume being 
'Indian Life in Town and Country,' by Mr. Her- 
bert Compton, whose intimate acquaintance with 
India extends back for thirty years. The first 
part of his work treats of 'Native Indian Life,' 
in which the reader is told some most surprising 
things about the divergences of race, religion, 
and language, in India,— divergences greater 
than in any portion of Europe; about what is 
meant by the term 'caste,' and what a powerful 
social influence is exerted thereby; about the 
condition of Avoman under the Indian social sys- 
tem; and about the new epoch in Indian affaii-s 
ushered in by the opening of the Suez Canal. 
With the subject of his later division, 'Anglo- 
Indian Life,' we might claim to have some pre- 
vious knowledge through Mr. Kipling 's tales ; but 
Mr. Compton 's chapters on 'Bungalow Life' and 
kindred topics will certainly aid to a better 
understanding and deeper appreciation of Mr. 
Kipling's 'Plain Tales from the Hills.' The book 
contains a wealth of information set forth in 
pleasing style, and verifies the statement quoted 
from De Tocqueville, 'There has never been any- 
thing so wonderful under the sun as the con- 
quest, and, still more, the government, of India 
by the British.' 

Text-books are not inspiring 
subjects for a reviewer. It is 
difficult to explain briefly the 
point of view or the manner of presentation of 
an author who addresses himself primarily to 
students. Particularly in psychology, in which 
topic scholars on this side of the Atlantic have 
contributed so many and such distinctive texts, 
is it difficult to characterize the status of another 
competitor for favor. Professor Murray of Mon- 
treal has re-written his former text-book of 
Psychology and made a larger and more readable 
volume of it (Little, Brown & Co.). The book 
belongs to the class of psychologies that depend 
upon description as the chief method of pres- 
entation. It covers the conventional ground, 
dividing the subject material into topics belong- 
ing to general psychology and those belonging to 
special psychology. In both portions clearness 
and readability are prominent, and an effort to 
carry the interest of the student is maintained. 
It cannot be said that the result presents any

to Psychology. 



unusual features; but Professor Murray's book 
will find favor among" those who sjnupathize with 
his methods of presentation. This verdict must 
not be understood as condemning the volume with 
faint praise, but, on the contrary, as an expres- 
sion of admiration for the success with which a 
well-planned scheme of presentation has been 
carried out. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



'House and Home,' by Miss Mary Elizabeth 
Carter, is a practical book on home management 
published by Messrs. A. S. Barnes & Co. It is a 
volume in 'The Woman's Home Library,' to which 
a second contribution is made by Miss Eleaner 

B. Clapp, whose book is entitled 'The Courtesies,' 
and is a manual of every-day etiquette. Allied 
to these books in interest is 'The Expert Maid- 
Servant,' by Mrs. Christine Terhune Herrick, just 
published by Messrs. Harper & Brothers. 

Messrs. Thomas Y. Crowell & Co. publish, in their 
'What Is Worth While' series, the following new 
volumes: 'How to Bring up our Boys,' by Mr. S. A. 
Nicoll; 'The Lost Art of Beading,' by Dr. W. 
Eobertson Nicoll; 'The Inner Life,' by Dr. J. E. 
Miller; and Count Tolstoy's recent 'Bethink Your- 
selves!' that most eloquent plea for an end of 
warfare. This moving tract has also just been sent 
us in pamphlet form by Messrs. Ginn & Co., as 
publishers for the International Union. It can- 
not be too widely circulated or deeply pondered. 

The new enlarged edition of 'Bryan's Dictionary 
of Painters and Engravers, ' as edited by Dr. George 

C. Williamson, has now reached the fourth volume, 
covering the letters from N to E. New biographies 
of the British painters Eeynolds, Eomney, and Eos- 
setti constitute the chief feature of this volume. 
An important article on E'uskin is contributed by 
Mr. Frederic Harrison. There are also entirely new 
biographies of the Italians Tintoretto, Francia, and 
Guido. The illustrations are numerous and satisfac- 
tory. The Macmillan Co. publish this standard 
work, which is now within one volume of comple- 
tion. 

Messrs. Thomas Y. Crowell & Co. are publishing 
a 'Library of Illustrated Biography,' consisting of 
reprints, each in a single fairly large volume, of 
standard works of this class. The following eight 
volumes are now ready: Mrs. Gaskell's life of 
Charlotte Bronte, Farrar's life of Christ, Cross's 
life of George Eliot, Lockhart's life of Scott, 
Irving 's lives of Columbus and Mahomet, Boswell's 
life of Johnson, and Professor James A. Harri- 
son's life of Poe, as recently written for the 'Vir- 
ginia' edition of that author's works. These 
handsomely-printed volumes are very desirable for 
library use, and are supplied at a moderate price. 

Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. publish in their 
'Chiswick' series a group of eleven small volumes, 
tastefully printed and bound, and having a con- 
siderable diversity of interest. The list is as fol- 
lows: Dante's 'New Life,' in Eossetti's match- 
less version; Gray's 'Elegy'; Goldsmith's 'Deserted 
Village'; Stoi-m's 'Immensee, ' translated by Miss 
Bertha M. Schimmelpfennig; FitzGerald's 'Omar'; 
'A Browning Calendar,' edited by Miss Constance 
M. Spender; Mr. Lang's translation of 'Aucassin 
and Nicolette'; 'The Face of the Master,' by Dr. 
J. E. Miller; 'Eichard Wagner,' by Mr. Nathan 
Haskell Dole; 'Eaphael of Urbino, ' "by Mrs. Sarah 
K. Bolton; and 'Ealph Waldo Emerson,' by the 
same writer. All these books are illustrated.

THE DIAIi 



[Nov. 1, 



Notes. 



It is understood that Mrs. Humphry Ward's 
next novel will appear serially in the ' Century ' dur- 
ing the coming year. A new story by Mrs. Alice 
Hegan Rice will form another interesting serial 
feature of the same magazine. 

A new edition (the seventh) of Dr. William 
Elliot Griffis's standard work on Corea, to be pub- 
lished at once by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons, 
will contain additional chapters bringing the his- 
tory down to the present year. 

Dr. James A. Henshall's 'Book of the Black 
Bass,' which for more than a decade has held 
place as a classic among anglers, is published by 
the Robert Clarke Co. in a new edition, thoroughly 
revised and embodying a supplement, 'More about 
the Black Bass.' 

With its October issue 'The Craftsman' appears 
in a new typographical dress, a distinct improve- 
ment over that hitherto used. We are glad to 
note the well-deserved success of this magazine, 
now the leading exponent of the arts and crafts 
movement in America. 

A tribute to the late ' Jenny June,' in the form 
of a volume entitled * Memories of Jane Cunning- 
ham Croly,' is published by the Messrs. Putnam. 
It is the work of various hands, and includes a num- 
ber of Mrs. Croly 's own papers and addresses, 
besides three portraits. 

One of the most important scientific publications 
of the year will be issued at once by the Univer- 
sity of Chicago Press in Prof. Jacques Loeb's 
'Studies in General Physiology.' The work pre- 
sents a systematic account of the author's recent 
noteworthy researches in the problems of life- 
phenomena and kindred subjects. 

A volume of pleasant and sprightly comment 
upon domestic topics is offered by the 'Every Day 
Essays' of Mrs. Marion Foster Washburne. The 
author has an optimistic temperament, and is pos- 
sibly a little inclined to sentiment, but her cheery 
philosophy of life is given a very attractive garb. 
Messrs. Rand, McNally & Co. are the publishers. 

We reserve for future mention the new volume 
of Mr. Kipling's stories, 'Traffics and Discoveries,' 
merely noting at present that it comes to us in the 
regular trade edition from Messrs. Doubleday, Page 
& Co., and also from Messrs. Charles Scribner's 
Sons as Volume XXII. of their handsome subscrip- 
tion edition of Mr. Kipling's works. 

'The Romance of Isabel, Lady Burton,' told in 
part by herself and in part by Mr. W. H. Wilkins, 
is presented by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. in a 
very attractive new edition, printed from new 
plates. The two volumes in which the work first 
appeared, seven years ago, are now reduced to 
one, though all of the original matter is retained. 

'A Short Constitutional History of the United 
States,' by Dr. Francis Newton Thorpe, is a con- 
densed form of the author's larger works upon 
the same subject. It is a single volume of clear 
exposition and closely reasoned discussion, made 
particularly valuable by its elaborate index to 
the Constitution, and its extensive lists of refer- 
ences to leading constitutional cases. Messrs. 
Little, Brown & Co. are the publishers. 

A new edition of Count Tolstoy's works, in 
twenty-fovir volumes, is being undertaken by 
Messrs. Dana Estes & Co. The translation is a 
new one, the work of Prof. Leo Weiner of Harvard, 
who has also prepared for the edition a new 
biography of Count Tolstoy. In addition to con- 
siderable matter not heretofore included in any 



English translation, the edition will contain an 
exhaustive bibliography and a unique alphabetical 
'thought-concordance' to the complete works. The 
illustrations will number nearly one hundred and 
fifty, reproduced in photogravure and etching. 

The new edition of Mathilde Blind's Life of 
George Eliot, announced for publication by Messrs.. 
Little, Brown & Co., will include a new chapter om 
George Eliot's present position in literature as. 
determined by the leading critics who have written 
of her in the twenty years following her death; 
some new information as to her life and environ- 
ment, gleaned from letters and surviving friends;:, 
and an exhaustive bibliography. Illustrations have- 
also been added.

HENRY VAN DYKE has produced a mature volume 
of serious poetry — -a distinct advance in tech- 
nical skill over his former volumes and wider in its 
sympathies and finer in its imagination. He is one 
of the very few men in this country who are writing 
poetry of distinction in form and profound in its in- 
spiration. He confirms his position as a leader 
among American poets by the Odes to "Music" 
and "God oftheOpen Air," by the sonnet "Patria," 
and by the lyrics "Light Between the Trees" and 
"A Mile with Me." These are poetry of a high 
rank, and moreover are inspiring to the reader.

The most casual reading of his work is sufficient to show what pains he took to sift all

to rest content with a casual reading, for the quality which chiefly distinguishes the 
volumes is that of enthralling interest.

The Early Day in Railroading 



By FRANK H. SPEARMAN 

DURING the last five years extraordinary strug- 
gles have arisen between contending finan- 
cial interests for supremacy in control among 
American railroads. The story of the strategy 
of those fights is one of real fascination. An 
enormous capital has been expended in rebuild- 
ing the transcontinental systems and links and 
the Atlantic trunk lines. New railroad wilder- 
nesses have been thrown open and states almost 
rediscovered. Mr. Spearman has put the story 
of all this concisely into his book, and it will 
appeal to those who have followed his railroad 
stories and enjoy a presentation of striking and 
dramatic features of railroad life and operation.

LITERATURE IN SCHOOL. 



The idea of literature considered as a subject 
for school instruction is not unsuggestive of 
the late Mr. Longfellow's popular verses on 
' Pegasus in Pound.' The case of the winged 
steed made captive and forced for a time to 
consort with the vulgar equine herd has a like 
quality of pathos with the case of Shakespeare's 
or Milton's soaring imagination brought down 
to earth and made to jostle roughly with the 
crude thoughts of childish minds. Theoretically, 
those minds may be taught to soar by this 
enforced communion; practically, they are apt 
to view with contempt the example offered 
them, and continue to grovel or to grope as 
before. Some of them, it is safe to say, will 
continue to grovel after the stage of childhood 
is past. They may become excellent blacksmiths 
or drummers or politicians, but their imagina- 
tions will never learn to soar, and the daily 
newspaper (with pictures) will be the only 
sort of reading that will ever really interest 
them. The grovellers are by nature impervious 
to literature, and they may frankly be aban- 
doned as hopeless. It is different with the 
gropers. They, at least, offer possibilities; but 
if these are to be encouraged and developed, it 
must be gradually and by persuasion, not sud- 
denly and by categorical imperative. Too fierce 
a flood of light, too determined a guidance, are 
dangers rather than helps to the groping spirit. 

Those of us who have been watching rather 
closely the developments of the past twenty 
years in the school teaching of English litera- 
ture do not feel altogether encouraged by what 
has been accomplished. The expenditure of 
breath and ink upon the subject has been 
prodigious; the results are so slight as to indi- 
cate that most of this energy has been misdi- 
rected. We have devices and methods and 
scientifically-planned courses without number, 
of a kind never dreamed of in the old days, 
but they do not seem to give our boys and girls 
a finer appreciation of literature, or a deeper 
love for good reading, than was achieved with- 
out making any particular fuss about it a gen- 
eration ago. It is evident that something is 
wrong, and it is deeply important for us to find 
out just where the fault lies, as a necessary pre- 
liminary for the suggestion of remedies. 

In a general way, we feel safe in asserting 
that the root of the failure to produce results 
in the teaching of English literature commen- 



294 



THE DIAL. 



[Nov. 16, 



surate with our efforts is to be found in the fact 
that we deal with the subject too much as we 
deal with other subjeots, not recognizing the 
differences which set it fundamentally apart 
from linguistics and history and science. We 
make it a matter of cram and pedantic detail, 
of examination and essay-writing, practices 
which are almost certain to defeat the inculca- 
tion of literary taste, although such inculcation 
must surely be the primary aim of the work. 
Above all, we administer prescribed texts and 
courses of reading, and tamely submit to the 
abominable system of specific tasks invented by 
the colleges to save themselves the trouble of 
making a real investigation of the literary qual- 
ifications of those who apply at their doors for 
admission. 

Three years ago President G. Stanley Hall, 
speaking upon this subject before the New 
England Association of Colleges and Second- 
ary Schools, denounced our present methods 
in the following vigorous language: 

'I doubt if among all the recent triumphs of the 
uniformitarians any has been worse than marking 
off a definite quantum in this great field, or more 
violence done to both the subject and the youthful 
mind. The wide acceptance of these requirement 
books and authors marks, I believe, a pedagogic 
decadence, which in a future far nearer than we 
dream of will be pointed out as the low-water mark 
of English teaching which the last century can 
show, and as one of the most disastrous triumphs 
of mechanism and convenience over mental needs.' 

This language is not, in our opinion, any too 
scathing, but we fear that the future toward 
which it so confidently looks will not prove to 
be one 'far nearer than we dream of.' Before 
we can secure the needed reform, we must over- 
come an inertia which it is difficult to overesti- 
mate; we must effect a general substitution of 
vital methods, which are difficult, for mechan- 
ical methods, which are easy, in the work of 
our teachers of English literature high and 
low. 

The single word 'flexibility' is the word 
which better than any other expresses the 
rational ideal of instruction in this all-impor- 
tant subject. The changes are rung upon this 
word, and upon the need which it fits, by Pro- 
fessor W. P. Trent, in a recent paper so admir- 
ahly conceived that it deserves the widest 
possible reading. Originally prepared as a lec- 
ture at Columbia University, it is now 
printed in the October issue of ' The Sewanee 
Keview.' The charge usually brought by the 
partisans of pedantry and mechanism against 
the literary teaching of literature is that it 
encourages ' chatter about Harriet,' and unreg- 
ulated emotional expression, and all the vapor- 
ings of dilettanteism. But this charge does 
not lie against an advocate who, like the one 
now in question, has already given to scholar- 



ship the most substantial of hostages, and whose 
precepts are the outcome of many years of 
professional practice. What such a man says 
carries weight, even if one dissents from it; 
for our own part, we agree most heartily with 
premises and conclusions alike. 

Mr. Trent, like the subject of * In Memo- 
riam,' has ' faced the spectres of the mind,' but 
he has not laid them. He says: 

*I even venture to question whether the average 
boy or girl goes to college with much more knowl- 
edge and love of literature than was the case before 
they were drilled and examined in the redoubtable 
"English Classics" . . . What I doubt is whether 
the generation now entering college, after a 
course of literature in the schools, is much better 
off, so far as a love and knowledge of literature 
are concerned, than my own generation was with 
practically no training in the subject. ' 

And the reasons for this failure he sees clearly 
enough. They are exemplified in the histories 
of English literature, in the kind of notes pro- 
vided with the texts studied^ in the misuse of 
the written examination, and in the vicious 
practice of writing essays, which are likely to 
be bricks without straw, except of the baled 
variety afforded by the encyclopaedias. 

Here are some apposite quotations upon 
each of the above four points, expressing the 
results of the writer's experience as a teacher : 

'But my new treatment of my younger students 
led to some important results. Beading so much 
to them myself and giving them so much outside 
reading to do left no time for the study of a formal 
manual of literary history. ... I finally required 
the reading of Stopford Brooke's excellent 
"Primer of English Literature," but did not 
examine on it. I knew well enough that I was mak- 
ing a sacrifice on the side of exact knowledge, but 
it seemed to me it had to be made.' 

'The teacher . . . must be prepared to make 
other sacrifices. If the annotated texts furnished 
him do not produce the best results, he must 
eschew their use. Personally I have found such 
texts occasionally valuable, but I prefer Palgrave s 
"Golden Treasury of Songs and Lyrics" to any 
annotated text I ever used.' 

'Do we not sacrifice the spirit of literature 
while we are examining on the letter, or rather 
training our poor children so that they may stand 
some other person's examination on the letter? As 
the dread day comes around, do teachers find them- 
selves and their classes reading with rapt interest 
the noble speeches of Portia, or are they busy 
with the date of the play, with some critic's opin- 
ion with regard to Portia's womanliness, with the 
names and dates of actual women lawyers and law 
teachers in Italy, with the sources of the caskets 
incident, and similar matters only too dear to 
examiners?' . i. * 

'For the school or college essay used as atest ot 
literary work rather than as a test of work in Eng- 
lish composition I must confess I have very little 
respect. I fear that it encourages smattering, that 
it stimulates juvenile conceit, that it tends to crys- 
tallize tastes and opinions at an age when every 
effort should be made to widen and lend flexibility 
to the mind, that it leads to unconscious plagiarism 
and to a complacent habit of airing one's common- 
placeness and fatuity.' 



1904.] 



THE DIAL 



296 



Mr. Trent calls these opinions heresies, and 
doubtless they will seenii so to many pedagogues. 
But the time will come when they shall be 
regarded as the merest commonplaces of self- 
evident truth, and not until that time does 
come will we have cause for self-gratulation on 
the subject of the teaching of literature. 

Our own conclusion is so exactly that of the 
writer that we cannot do better than state it in 
the words which he uses as a spokesman of the 
class of teachers to which he belongs. Address- 
ing his fellow-teachers of other subjects, he 
says: 

'We can, if we please, make our examinations 
as rigid as you do yours, but we do not believe 
that our facts are as important as yours, or at any 
rate can be acquired with so much advantage to our 
pupils. We wish to grade and advance our pupils 
on more flexible lines than you adopt, because we 
believe that the nature of our subject makes such 
flexible lines advisable. We believe that both the 
subject we teach and the subjects you teach are 
necessary to a catholic education; but that, while 
we are contributing to the same end as you, our 
means must be different from yours.' 

And the upshot of the matter is that our work 
' resolves itself into little more than securing a 
wide amount of reading from children during 
their school years. . . Let us have fewer new 
bad essays written and more good old books 
read.' 



ROMANCE AND REALISM. 

Although fiction deals with the lives and 
characters of imaginary people, it is at its best 
no less true than history and biography, which 
set forth the actual facts of life. The trui^i 
of fiction is indioated by its constant popularity 
in all ages among all races. * You can't fool all 
the people all the time,' and if the drama and 
the epic and novel were not true, men would 
pass them by as they put away childish things. 

There is a distinction between fact and truth, 
between actuality and reality. A fact is a spe- 
cific manifestation of a general law: this gen- 
eral law is the truth that causes and explains 
the fact. It is a fact that when an apple-tree 
is shaken in the breeze, the apples that are 
loosened from the twigs fall to the ground ; it is 
a truth that bodies in space attract each other 
with a force varying inversely as the square of 
the distance between them. The universe as 
we feel it with our senses is actulal : the laws of 
the universe as we discover them by our under- 
standing are real. 

All human investigation, whether scientific 
or artistic, is an endeavor to arrive at the truth 
which underlies the facts that we perceive; it 
is an effort to understand the large reality of 
which the actuial is but a sensuously percepti- 
ble embodiment. Both the scientist and the 



artist begin their work by collecting a large 
number of related facts and arranging them in 
an intelligent manner; and then proceed to 
induce from the observation of them an appre- 
hension of the general law thiat explains their 
relation. This hypothesis is then tested in the 
light of further experience, until it seems 
so incontestible that men's minds accept it as 
the truth. Art and SK3ience do not differ in 
their method of arriving at the truth; they 
diverge merely in their means of expressing it 
after it has been apprehended. The scientist 
formulates it in a theoretic statement, while 
the artist gives it an imaginative embodiment 
perceptible to the senses. 

The purpose of fiction is to embody the truth 
of human life in a series of relations between 
imaginary characters. The writer of fiction, 
when he does his work well, first observes care- 
fully the facts of life, studies them in the light 
of extended experience, and induces from them 
certain general laws which he deems to be the 
truths which underlie them. He then creates 
imaginatively such characters and scenes as will 
illustrate the truths he has discovered and con- 
vey them clearly to the minds of his readers. 
His work must be as earnest and rigorous as 
that of the natural scientist; and it is there- 
fore not strange that most great novelists should 
ripen late. 

If the general laws of life which the novelist 
has thought out be true laws, and if his imag- 
inary embodiment of them be thoroughly 
consistent, his characters will be true men 
and women in the highest sense. They will 
not be actual, but they will be real. The 
great characters of fiction, — Sir Willoughby 
Patteme, Tito Melema, D 'Artagnan, Pere 
Grandet, Eosalind, Tartuffe, Hamlet, Ulysses, 
— embody truths of life that have been arrived 
at only after long observation of facts and 
patient induction from them. Cervantes must 
have observed many, many dreamers before he 
learned the truth of the idealist's character 
which he has expressed in Don Quixote. The 
great people of fiction are typical of large 
classes of mankind. They live more truly than 
do you and I, because they are made of us 
and of many men beside. They have the large 
reality of general ideas, which is a truer thing 
than the actuality of facts. This is why we 
know them and think of them as real people, — 
old acquaintances whom we knew before we 
were born, when we lived with them in Plato's 
realm of ideas. In France, instead of calling a 
man a miser, they speak of him as :an Harpagon. 
We know Rosalind as we know our latest sum- 
mer love; Hamlet is our elder brother, and 
understands our own wavering and faltering. 

The characters in the noblest fiction are so real 
and true that even their creator has no power

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



to make them do what they will not. Shake- 
speare tells us that Oliver suddenly clmnged 
his nature and won the love of Celia; but we 
know that in this case Shakespeare lies. The 
scene is not true to the truth of fiction. Colonei 
Newcome is a dear old soul, and we do not 
want him to be made miserable ; but if Thack- 
eray had told us that the good man lived hap- 
pily until his death, surrounded by the people 
that he knew, Thackeray would have lied. The 
author had to tell the bitter truth, though it 
cost him many tears. Arbitrary plotting is of 
no avail in fiction : Tom and Maggie Ttilliver 
were not really drowned in a flood. We know 
when a story is true and when it is not. 

The aim, then, of all writers of fiction who 
take their work seriously and do it honestly, 
is to body forth the truth of life in a series of 
imagined facts. But there are two different 
ways of doing this — two distinct micthods of 
setting forth the truth; and hence we find two 
schools of novelists, which we distinguish by 
the titles Eealistic and Eomantic. 

The distinction between Eealism and Rom- 
ance is fundamental and wide-reaching; for 
every man, whether consciously or not, is either 
a realist or a romanticist. The reader who is a 
realist by nature will prefer George Eliot to 
Scott; the reader who is romantic will rather 
read Victor Hugo than Balzac; and neither 
taste is better than the other. Each is born in 
the blood, and has its origin deep in the gen- 
eral heart of man. In view of this fact, it 
seems strange that no adequate definition has 
over been made of the difference between Eeal- 
ism and Eomance. Various superficial explan- 
ations have been offered, it is true; but none 
of these has been scientific and satisfactory. 
We have been told, for instance, that the roman- 
ticists dwell chiefly upon action, while the real- 
ists are interested mainly in drawing character. 
But this explanation is obviously wrong, for we 
have great romantic characters like Eomeo, and 
great realistic scenes like Eawdon Crawley's 
discovery of his wife with Lord Steyne. We 
have been told also that the realists paint the 
manners of their own place and time, while the 
romanticists deal with more unusual material ; 
but Stevenson's highly romantic ' 'New Arabian 
Nights ' depicts details of London 'and Parisian 
life in our own day, and the realistic 'Bomola ' 
carries us back through many centuries to a 
medifeval city far away. 

For the true distinction between Eealism 
and Eomance, we must revert to our analogy 
between the work of the writer of fiction and 
that of the natural scientist. If we consider 
the matter carefully, we shall see that the dif- 
ference is merely this: In setting forth his 
view of life, the realist follows the inductive 
method of presentment, while the romanticist 



follows the deductive method. The distinction 
between inductive and deductive processes of 
thought is very simple and is known to all. 
When we think inductively, we reason from 
the particular to the general; and when we 
think deductively, we reverse the process and 
reason from the general to the particular. In 
our ordinary conversation, we speak inductively 
when we first mention a number of simple facts 
and then draw from them some general infer- 
ence; and we speak deductively when we first 
express a general opinion and then illustrate 
it by adducing siDccific illustrations. Now it is 
just in this way that Eealism differs from 
Eomance. Both the realist and the romanticist 
aim to set forth a true view of life; but in; 
doing so, as I have said, the realist works 
inductively and the romanticist deductively. 

In order to bring to our knowledge the law 
of life which he wishes to make clear, the realist 
first leads us through a series of imagined facts 
as similar as possible to the details of actual 
life which he was obliged to study in order to 
arrive at his general conception. He elabo- 
rately imitates the facts of life, so that he 
may say to us finally, ' This is what I saw in 
the world, and from this I learned the truth I 
have to tell you.' He leads us step by step from 
the particular to the general, until at last we 
not only know the truth he has to express but 
are also familiar with the very processes of 
thought by which he arrived at this truth. 
' Adam Bede ' tells us not only what George 
Eliot knew about life, but also how she came to 
learn it. 

But the romantic novelist works differently. 
He does not try to show us how he arrived at 
his general conception. His only care is to 
bring his general idea home to us by giving it a 
specific illustrative embodiment. He feels no 
obligation to make the imagined facts of his 
story resemble closely the actual details of life; 
he is anxious only that they shall represent his 
idea adequately and consistently. Stevenson 
knew that man has a dual nature, and that the 
evil in him, when pampered, will gradually 
gain the upper hand over the good. He did not 
attempt to set forth this truth inductively, 
showing us the kind of facts from the observa- 
tion of which he had drawn his conclusion. 
He merely gave his thought an illustrative 
embodiment, conceiving a dual charajcter in 
which a man's uglier self should have a separate 
incarnation. He constructed his tale deduct- 
ively: beginning with a general conception, he 
reduced it to particular terms. ' Dr. Jekyll 
and Mr. Hyde ' is a thoroughly true story, even 
though its incidents are contrary to the actual 
facts of life. It is just as real as a realistic 
novel ; and in order to make it so, its author, 
because he was working deductively, was not

THE DIAL

obliged to imitate the facts he had observed. 
' I have learned something in the world/ he 
says to us ; * here is a fable that will make it 
clear to you.' 

We see immediately that each of these two 
methods of presentment is natural and true; 
and hence all criticism that aims to exalt 
Romance above Realism, or Realism above 
Romance, must be forever futile. The minds 
of men have always moved in two channels, and 
always will. We have both inductive 'and 
deductive sciences, — we even have inductive 
and deductive systems of morality; and as 
long as men shall write, we shall have, and ought 
to have, both inductive and deductive fiction. 

Neither of these two methods of writing fi^c- 
tion — • the realistic and the romantic — is truer 
than the other; and both are great when they 
are well employed. Each, however, lends itself 
to certain abuges which it will be well for us to 
notice briefly. In his careful imitation of 
actual life, the realist may grow near-sighted 
and come to value facts for their own sake, 
forgetting that his primary purpose in setting 
them forth should be to lead us to understand 
the truths which underlie them. From this 
misconception arise the tedious minuteness of 
George Eliot, the interminable tea-cups of 
Anthony Trollope, and the mire of the imita- 
tors of Zola. The romanticist, on the other hand, 
because he works with greater freedom, may 
o'erleap himself and express in a loose fashion 
general conceptions which are hasty and devoid 
of truth. To this defect is owing the vast deal 
of rubbish which has been foisted on us recently 
by feeble imitators of Scott and Dumas. The 
realists gain nothing by hooting at the abuses of 
Romance ; and the romanticists gain as little by 
yawning over Realism at its worst. The Scylla 
and the Charybdis of fiction-writing may both 
be avoided ; and at their best, the realist work- 
ing inductively, and the romanticist working 
deductively, are equally able to arrive at the 
truth of fiction. Clayton Hamilton. 



COMM UNIC A TION. 

'THE SOCIALIZATION OF HUMANITY.' 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 
May I ask for a little space in your journal iu 
which to reply to some strictures on my book, 
'The Socialization of Humanity,' reviewed in 
your issue of October 16? In the first place, 
your reviewer says that * There are many quota- 
tions from Comte' in my book; whereas in fact 
there is nojt even one. Your reviewer would 
lead a person to think I am a Positivist, a dis- 
ciple of Comte; whereas I am no more a disciple 
of Comte than of Spencer or Schopenhauer, or 
of any other philosopher who has profoundly 



influenced the thought of the race. He says I 
did not heed Spencer's criticism of Comte; 
whereas I did heed it, and cited it as an example 
of the familiar fact that even the greatest of 
philosophers are often unjust in criticising one 
another. He says, further, *We have a mislead- 
ing reference to Kant (p. 90) ; his destructive 
criticism of theology is mentioned, but nothing 
is said of his constructive argument.' Yet on 
page 344 of my book I do refer to his construc- 
tive argiunent, showing that it was based on 
sentiment, not on facts and reason. 

Your reviewer quotes an invective sentence 
criticizing the successful teacher in our modern 
universities; but he heads his remark with, 'This 
is the author's idea of a university,' which is 
absurdly false. Throughout the book, time and 
again, I say that the function of the school is 
to adjust man to his environment, natural and 
social, and that in the future it will be the great- 
est institution of the race, and the teacher the 
greatest of men. He ends his criticism by saying 
of my invective sentence, ' One must feel relieved 
after expelling that kind of matter from his 
consciousness!' Had I reviewed a book as he 
reviewed mine, I am sure I would have a load on 
my conscience, even if the review was actuated 
by feeling aroused from criticism of my pro- 
fession or opposition to my beliefs. 

One of the books noticed in connection with 
mine was 'The Laws of Imitation,' by Gabriel 
Tarde. Your reviewer points out the imperfec- 
tion of Tarde 's concept, saying, 'Imitation is a 
fact which explains many facts, but it itself is a 
phenomenon to be explained.' Yet he failed to 
see that in Chapter II. of my book this difficulty 
is overcome in my concept of the Law of Repeti- 
tion, in which I show that there are two forms 
of this law, internal and external, and that imita- 
tion is but a form of the Law of External Repeti- 
tion. The sub-title of my book, 'An Analysis 
and Synthesis of the Phenomena of Nature, Life, 
Mind, and Society, through the Law of Repeti- 
tion, ' should have caused him to compare the two 
books, for both attempt to explain the various 
phenomena of Nature through different concep- 
tions of the same great law. 

Your reviewer remarks that 'Those who have 
felt the rational difficulties of this crude form 
of monism may regard it as final' ; and then 
suggests that those who have studied Hegel, 
Kant, Green, Pfleiderer, and Tiele, will conclude 
'that there are problems of philosophy that this 
writer has not even had a glimpse of.' Perhaps 
so. But would a philosopher send a pupil to 
Kant or Hegel to-day expecting him to find a 
solution of the Riddle of the Universe? Spencer 
says of Kant: 'I commenced reading a copy of 
Kant's " Critique of Pure Reason," but did not 
go far. The doctrine that Time a»d Space are 
" nothing but subjective forms,— pertain exclu- 
sively to consciousness, and have nothing beyond 
consciousness answering to them,"— I rejected at 
once and absolutely. Tacitly, giving an author 
credit for consistency, I take it for granted that 
if his fundamental principles are wrong the rest 
cannot be right' (Autobiography, Vol. I., p. 289).

Schopenhauer says of Hegel : ' But the height of 
audacity in serving up pure nonsense, in string- 
ing together senseless and extravagant mazes of 
words, such as had previously been heard only in 
mad-houses, was finally reached in Hegel, and 
became the instrument of the most barefaced 
mystification that has ever taken place, with a 
result which will appear fabulous to posterity 
and will ever remain as a monument of German 
stupidity.' ('The World as Will and Idea,' 
Vol. n., p. 22.) After this, one would think 
there would be an end to citing Kant and Hegel 
as authorities with which to eclipse present-day 
philosophers. 

Knowing the fairness of The Dial I submit 
my protest to this review. No one could pos- 
sibly gather from it anything as to the real 
nature of my book.

[The authoor's retort is natural, and, from 
his standpoint, just. Certainly he has a right 
to a hearing. It may be more exact to say 
tliat he uses Comte's ideas without giving him 
credit by name; and if he prefers this phras- 
ing to ' quotation,' he is welcome to use it. His 
reference to page 344, w^here Kant is said to 
have rejected a belief in God, must further 
illustrate his misrepresentation of that author. 
The charge made against actual universities 
whatever might happen in the author's imag- 
inary institutions, the reviewer still believes to 
be gross caricature. Each reader must judge for 
himself whether the author has improved on 
Tarde; the reviewer finds nothing of value in 
the additions. In spite of the formidable quo- 
tation from Mr. Spencer, weighted with the 
author's own judgment, the idealists will prob- 
ably continue to hold a place in the scholar's 
world. — The Reviewer.]

The Advance of the West.* 



The publication of a series of reprints of 
' Early Western Travels ' in thirty-one volumes, 
contemporaneously with the appearance of the 
Lewis and Clark journals in their first com- 
plete form, and so soon after the monumental 
edition of the ' Jesuit Relations,' is a sign of 
the interest that is aroused in Western history 
and an indication that the region on this side 
of the Alleghany mountains has reached the 
stage that comes to every people when, in the 
pride of achievement, it turns to survey the 
records of its past. Dr. Thwaites, the editor 
of all these series, has done a service to his- 
torical scholarship in bringing out these impor- 
tant sources of Western history. 

It is a wonderful panorama that these ' Early 
Western Travels ' reveal. The ' Jesuit Rela- 
tions ' had exhibited the French exploration of 
the vast interior as told by religious enthusiasts 
wandering in the forests of the Great Lakes, 
pushing their canoes along the labyrinth of 
water-courses that thread the Mississippi Valley, 
and describing the savage life in this wild new 
world before the coming of the farmer and the 
artisan. The eight volumes thus far issued 
in the present series of western travel show 
us the procession of civilization into this wilder- 
ness for two generations after the middle of the 
eighteenth centur}^ The opening volume tell> 
of traders among the Indians of the Ohio and 
agents from English Colonies negotiating by 
savage council-fires for Indian friendship in 
the final struggle just beginning between Eng- 
land and France for the dominance of the Ohio 
Valley in the middle of the eighteenth century. 
Successive travellers carry forward the story 
of advance into new regions and describe the 
development in the older areas over which they 
pass. We are taken into the life of fur-traders

in the forests of Canada and Wisconsin, in the 
days of the Eevolution. We are shown the begin- 
nings of town-life on the Ohio, in Kentucky 
and Tennessee, and on the uplands of the Caro- 
linas, in the closing years of the eighteenth and 
the first of the nineteenth century. Later 
travellers in the period preceding and following 
the War of 1812 describe for us the farms, the 
inns, the life on the highways along the road 
blazed by the soldiers of the French and Indian 
war, and show us communities, still rude and in 
the gristle, but buoyant with young life and 
vigor, springing up where the log-cabin and the 
backwoodsman's clearing had made a begin- 
ning, or on the sites recently occupied by trad- 
ers' stations or by army posts on the Ohio. 
They carry us down the current of the Mis- 
sissippi, and give us views of the plantations on 
its lower reaches, of New Orleans, and of the 
returning boatmen making the dangerous over- 
lajid journey by the Natchez trace, or going by 
sea to Philadelphia to complete by land the 
circuit to the head of the Ohio. In the later 
volumes, pathfinders for the advance into the 
wider West stretching across the Great Plains 
and the Eocky Mountains to the waters of the 
Pacific tell of their adventures and picture the 
savages and the country. As traveller after 
traveller in successive periods passes over the 
routes of his predecessor, reporting the life by 
the wayside and in the towns, we can almost 
see American society unfolding with startling 
rapidity under our gaze; farms become ham- 
lets, hamlets grow into cities; the Indian and 
the forest recede; new stretches of wilderness, 
unoccupied empires, come into view in the 
farther West, and we see the irresistible tide 
of settlement flowing toward the solitudes. 

In spite of all the petty detail of personal 
elements, and the daily itinerary, these volumes 
are intensely interesting ; for we have not many 
dry pages to turn before we come upon some 
realistic Indian speech exhibiting forebodings 
of their coming doom, some graphic descrip- 
tion of Indian life or traders' perils, some pen- 
picture of a city now populous and powerful in 
the commerce of the Union, but then in its rude 
infancy. But the volumes are more than enter- 
taining. For the critical reader, they constitute 
a mine of material on the economic and social 
development of the West. Making due allow- 
ance for the mistakes of the travellers, we may 
learn much from them of such topics as the 
land-values of the successive areas of settle- 
ment, and may better comprehend the forces at 
work to attract the pioneers to the cheap lands 
that bordered the region of towns and clearings. 
We have accounts of pioneer agriculture ; of the 
modes of clearing the land ; of the shipments of 
the surplus of flour down the Ohio and the 
Mississippi, to serve the planters of the South or 



to go on to the West Indies ; and of the droves 
of cattle and hogs going to Baltimore or Phila- 
delphia. Tables of prices of provisions and 
the rate of wages in Western communities show 
the exceeding cheapness of some commodities 
and the dearness of others, and the opportu- 
nities that the West afforded to the workman to 
secure a surplus with which to purchase lands 
of his own. The beginnings of cotton cultiva- 
tion in the up-country of the South, along the 
alluvial lands of the lower Mississippi, and in 
central Tennessee, are noted, and the depend- 
ence of the staple areas upon the provisions of 
the upper Mississippi Valley. We are also 
given pictures of the social life of the West- 
erners ; the contrasts between the Southern and 
New England elements are drawn, and the 
beginnings of an interest in music and the 
drama are indicated as occasional exceptions 
in the general indifference to such elements of 
social development. 

Of course, the accounts of these travellers 
are to be taken with many grains of allowance. 
America bitterly resented the tone of most of 
the English visitors, and denied the correctness 
of their portraiture of our manners and condi- 
tions. The 'War of the Eeviews,' from 1819 
to 1824, which McMaster has epitomised in the 
fourth volume of his ' History of the American 
People,' shows how the English periodicals 
pointed their criticisms against American civil- 
ization on the basis of the accounts of Eliglish 
travellers, and how hotly their criticism was 
resented by the sensitive American public. The 
traveller is always prone to be impressed by 
the exceptional rather than by the typical; the 
English travellers of that day particularly had 
their own customs and prejudices, and for the 
most part they did not remain long enough to 
acquire full comprehension of the conditions. 
But the present series combines American with 
English and French travels, and the volumes 
so far issued are sympathetic rather than cap- 
tious. 

The principle of selection applied by Dr. 
Thwaites is a compromise between the desire of 
the publishers, on the one side, that only rare 
boofe should be selected, and the natural incli- 
nation of the editor to choose those of greatest 
historical value. The volumes dealing with 
the region east of the Mississippi in the period 
from 1800 to 1835, for example, are selected 
from a possible list of at least a hundred, many 
of them quite as worthy as those included, some 
more valuable. But some of the best of these 
are still in the market, so that we may be thank- 
ful for the policy that has given renewed life to 
those that were disappearing. Works in Eng- 
lish, French, German, Italian, and Spanish 
exist for this period, which seems to have 
attracted an unusual number of travellers.

THE DIAI. 



[Nov. 16, 



Only brief characterizations can here be given 
to the separate volumes that treat of the coun- 
try east of the Mississippi, leaving for future 
review the travels of Bradbury, Brackenridge, 
Franchere, and Ross, which extended to tibe 
Missouri and Oregon countries. 

The first volume of the series is made up of 
typical early journeys into the Indian countr}' 
in the middle of the eighteenth century, when 
the Ohio wilderness was the region of Indian 
fighting and the bone of contention between 
England and France. Conrad Weiser's journal 
of a tour to the Ohio in 1748, as agent of the 
colony of Pennsylvania, tells of his mission to 
bring presents to the Indians. ' Bretheren,' said 
he to the Ohio savages, ' some of you have been 
in Philadelphia last Fall & acquainted us that 
You had taken up the English Hatchet, and 
that you had already made use of it against 
the French, & that the French had very hard 
heads & your Country afforded nothing but 
Sticks & Hickerys which was not sufficient to 
break them.' The peace of 1748 intervening, 
the English had changed the succor thus 
demanded to a friendly present, with the inti- 
mation that the French would soon be at war 
again with the English. Nothing could more 
clearly reveal the hollowness of the treaty and 
the certainty of hostilities on the Ohio. The 
editorial introduction to this volume gives only 
an inadequate presentation of the career of 
Conrad Weiser, whose life exhibits the impor- 
^tance of the German element in the interior of 
New York and Pennsylvania; no reference is 
made to the recent biographies of Weiser. 

The Irish element on the frontier is repre- 
sented by selections from the writings of George 
Croghan, illustrating, (1) the period of Eng- 
lish ascendancy on the Ohio, by three docu- 
ments of 1750 and 1751; (2) the period of 
French ascendancy, hostility toward the Eng- 
lish, and war on the frontiers, by four docu- 
ments of 1754-1757; and (3) the period of the 
close of the war, the surrender of the French 
forts, and the renewed hostility of the Indians, 
by two journals. Croghan's work as fur-trader 
and Indian agent for Pennsylvania, and after- 
wards for New York, was very important. It is 
interesting to notice the careful attention to 
soils and other conditions for fufture settlement 
shown in his journals. The account of his jour- 
ney of 1765, which was an important source for 
Parkman in his ' Conspiracy of Pontiac,' is a 
combined version made by the present editor 
from two supplementary versions, one the offi- 
cial report (New York Colonial Documents, 
VII. 779-788), and the other the private jour- 
nal published by Featherstonehaugh and after- 
ward by Mann Butler in his ' History of Ken- 
tucky.' For the "Western conditions in this 



period of transition of the Ohio Valley from 
French to English control, the writings of 
Croghan are of much value. The list of Indian 
tribes in the Northern district, with the location 
and numbers of warriors, is a valuable document 
for the student of the American Indians. 

Post's journals give us his two journeys to 
the Ohio; one in 1758 to the neighborhood of 
Fort Duquesne, and the other in 1758-59 to win 
the Indians to support the advance of General 
Forbes. Post was a Moravian missionary, and 
his career illustrates the way in which the 
English authorities made use of these German 
apostles of peace to conciliate the Indians. The 
courage and devotion of this missionary clearly 
appear in his journey into the hostile region of 
the forks of the Ohio still possessed by the 
French. We get from his journals the impres- 
sion (due perhaps to his own views in paxt) 
that the Indians were reluctantly drawn into 
the conflict between the French and the Eng- 
lish. ' Why do not you and the French fight in 
the old country, and on the sea? Why do you 
come to fight on our land? This makes every- 
body believe you want to take the land from us 
by force and settle it.' 

Captain Morris's journal is of a different 
type. It is by an English officer, with a light- 
ness of literary touch and an equal lightness of 
mind, ' a fashionable dilettante ' who was rather 
out of place in the midst of the hostile condi- 
tions of Detroit and the Maumee in 1764. His 
account of his escapes from torture and his 
flight to Detroit is interesting, as is his inter- 
view with Pontiac (pp. 305, 307). 

The second volume is given to the travels 
of John Long, an English Indian-trader who 
came to North America in 1768 and passed 
nearly twenty years among the Indians of the 
upper St. Lawrence, the Nipigon district north 
and northeast of Lake Superior, and in the 
Hudson Bay region. The work is of value in its 
description of the intercourse of traders and 
savages, in the period of the free trader, before 
the great fur companies were formed; in its 
accounts of the Indians ; and in its narrative of 
the expedition of Canadians and Indiansfrom 
Mackinac to Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, in 
1780, to secure the furs of that place from 
capture by the forces of George Rogers Clark. 
The book appeared in London in 1791, when 
the question of the evacuation of the North- 
western posts was under consideration by Eng- 
land; and Long's opinion that the retention of 
the posts was essential to England's maintain- 
ing an effective barrier for Canada, doubtless 
influenced public opinion. The appendix to 
this volume contains a vocabulary of the Chip- 
peway language. The conservatism of the 
editor is shown by his note to Long's assertion

that 'the Menominee Indians kill their wives 
and children before they go to battle/ Dr. 
Thwaites comments that ' No mention of such 
a barbarous custom as this is made by other 
writers. Long may have been misinformed.' 
Let us hope so ! 

In the third volume we have the travels of 
the Michauxs, father and son. Andre Michaux's 
journal is of interest not only as a view of 
Kentucky conditions in 1793, and of the west- 
ern waters in 1795-96, but also from the fact 
that the journey was something more than the 
tour of a botanist. Michaux was the agent of 
Genet to concert with George Rogers Clark an 
attack by the frontiersmen upon New Orleans 
in the interest of France. It is only side-lights 
that we get, however, upon his important inter- 
views with Kentucky leaders. The later jour- 
ney of 1795 and 1796 no doubt had also a rela- 
tion to the revised plans of France for the 
recovery of Louisiana in those years. As a 
botanist of well-established reputation, Michaux 
could travel in these regions without especial 
suspicion; and his journal gives ample evi- 
dence that his heart was in his botani- 
cal investigation. Jefferson had favored him 
as the leader of a trans-continental exploration 
by way of the Missouri in 1793 (not 1794, as 
the editor's note gives it), and was, in fact, 
familiar with Genet's purposes in sending him 
to Kentucky. Michaux gives us information 
on the routes of travel between Kentucky 
and Tennessee and the seaboard, and upon the 
extent of settlement in the period of his visits 
to the West. 

Frangois Andr6 Michaux, the son, is a more 
valuable traveller, for he wrote fuller accounts 
of the western country which he visited in 1802. 
He also was a botanist of note, and his expedi- 
tion was undertaken under the auspices of the 
French Minister of the Interior at the time 
when France had actually received Louisiana 
by treaty, and when she was preparing to take 
possession. He was one of a considerable num- 
ber of savants sent into the West by France, 
in this period, to report upon the country. His 
descriptions include accounts of Charleston, 
New York, Philadelphia, and the route to Pitts- 
burgh. The growing importance of this gate- 
way of the Ohio Valley was recognized by 
Michaux, and he gives us an appreciative pic- 
ture of the Ohio Valley, Kentucky, Tennessee, 
and the return route between the mountains 
and Charleston. The time was that when the 
cultivation of cotton was extending into the 
up-country of the South, and Michaux's ac- 
count of the progress of this movement is 
highly important. But his own preference was 
for the Ohio, ' the centre of commercial activity 
between the eastern and western states.* He 



gives his opinion ' that the banks of the Ohio, 
from Pittsburgh to Louisville inclusively, will, 
in the course of twenty years, be the most pop- 
ulous and commercial part of the United States, 
and where I should settle in preference to any 
other.' The reader will enjoy his accounts of 
agriculture and commerce in the West. He 
tells of the success of the Marietta settlers in 
' exporting directly to the Carribee Islands the 
produce of the country, in a vessel built in their 
own town, which they sent to Jamaica ' ; of the 
horse-trade of Kentucky with Charleston; of 
the Kentucky cattle, driven in droves of from 
two to three hundred to Virginia, along the 
Potomac river, where they were sold to graziers 
who (in anticipation of the arrangement 
between the ranchers of the Great Plains and 
the Kansas farmers of our time) fattened them 
for the markets of Baltimore and Philadelphia ; 
of the lone backwoodsman on the upper Ohio, 
paddling in a canoe to examine the borders 
of the Missouri for a hundred and fifty miles 
beyond its mouth. 

* His costume, like that of all the American sports- 
men, consisted of a waistcoat with sleeves, a pair of 
pantaloons, and a large red and yellow worsted 
sash. A carabine, a tomahawk or little axe, which 
the Indians make use of to cut wood and to termi- 
nate the existence of their enemies, two beaver- 
snares, and a large knife suspended at his side, 
constituted his sporting dress. A rug comprised the 
whole of his luggage. . . . Such were the first 
inhabitants of Kentucky and Tennessee, of whom 
there are now remaining but very few. It was they 
who began to clear those fertile countries and 
wrested them from the savages who ferociously dis- 
puted their right; it was they, in short, who made 
themselves masters of the possessions, after five or 
six years of bloody war; but the long habit of a 
wandering and idle life has prevented their enjoy- 
ing the fruit of their labors, and profiting by the 
very price to which these lands have risen in so 
short a time. They have emigrated to more remote 
parts of the country, and formed new settlements. 
It will be the same with most of those who inhabit 
the borders of the Ohio.' 

He goes on to picture the coming of later emi- 
grants from the Atlantic states, who will 
replace the log-house with framed dwellings, 
and extend the clearing to fields of varied agri- 
culture. 

This volume also contains Dr. Harris's ' Tour 
into the Territory Northwest of the Allegheny 
Mountains' (1803). Harris was a New Eng- 
land clergyman, for a time librarian of Har- 
vg,rd, and a member of the Massachusetts His- 
torical Society, and various other learned 
associations. The work contains useful data, 
but is brief and lacks the charm of description 
of Western life found in more sympathetic 
visitors. His journey took him through Penn- 
sylvania to Marietta, Ohio, and the return. 

As the younger Michaux portrays an advance 
of settlement over that described by his father.

so Fortescue Cuming, in his ' Sketches of a 
Tour to the Western Country' in 1807-1809, 
gives a further stage of growth. He was a 
travelled Englishman, fair in his Judgments, 
and a good observer. The first part of his trip 
was made on foot from Philadelphia to Pitts- 
burg; after a sojourn through the winter there, 
he went by boat to Marysville, Kentucky, and 
thence on horseback through the blue-grass 
lands of Kentucky, and back to Maysville. 
From here he proceeded along the stage-road 
through Chillicothe and Zanesville to Wheeling, 
and returned to Pittsburg. The following year 
he went by boat down the Ohio and the Mis- 
sissippi to Bayou Pierre, and thence on horse- 
back into the settlements of Mississippi terri- 
tory and into West Florida. Cuming remained 
long enough in the West to understand its life, 
and the book abounds in interesting material 
on the stage of development which Michaux 
foresaw —the development of town-life, and 
the replacement of the hunter type by the agri- 
cultural settler and the bustling town-builder. 
It would be impossible here to sketch the con- 
tents of his work, but it is sufficient to say that 
it is one of the best of its class. 

The fifth volume contains a summary of con- 
ditions in Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, lUinois, 
and the surrounding regions, by Bradbury, a 
Scotch naturalist, who accompanied the Astor- 
ians in 1810 to the Mandans, but returned with 
Brackenridge. He went down the Mississippi 
to New Orleans in 1811, and spent the period 
of the war of 1812 in the United States, pos- 
sibly making his journey to the Ohio Valley 
after this. The work is a useful estimate of 
conditions at the same period as Cuming's tour, 
and adds material on the situation at the close 
of the war. 

In volume eight, two American travellers 
give their views of the West in the years 1813 
to 1819. Buttriok was a New Englander who 
had made a voyage to the East Indies by way 
of the Cape of Good Hope, and another to the 
West Indies, both of which he describes. His 
love of wandering took him to Kentucky in 
1814, by the route through New York to the 
Alleghany; and in the succeeding year he 
repeated his journey. He gives us an account 
of emigrants chiefly from Maine, who had gath- 
ered to the number of about twelve hundred 
at the headwaters of the Alleghany, waiting 
for the opening of navigation to descend the 
Ohio to seek farms where they might avoid the 
hard times that followed the war of 1812 in 
New England. He went on to New Orleans, 
and returned over the famous Natchez trace 
through the Indian country — the route of 
returning flatboat men. Of the perils of travel 
through this lawless region, he gives a vivid 
picture. 



In his ' Pedestrious Tour of Four Thousand 
Miles through the Western States and Terri- 
tories,' Estwick Evans, a New Hampshire law- 
yer, evidently eccentric, gives an account of 
his journey through western New York and 
northern Ohio to Detroit, and then down the 
Alleghany, the Ohio, and the Mississippi, to 
New Orleans. Even his absurd garb of furs, 
his painfully verbose moralizing, and his other 
oddities, do not destroy the value of his reports 
of life in the West after the ravages of the 
war. Michigan territory, Indiana, and Illi- 
nois, are described in an important period of 
their forming society, and the rich life of the 
Southern plantations on the lower Mississippi 
is brought vividly before the reader. 

When an editor has achieved the deservedly 
high reputation enjoyed by Dr. Thwaites for 
the accuracy and clearness of his notes, it i«? 
to be expected that critics will find particular 
enjoyment in the discovery of slips. The edi- 
torial introductions and abundant annota.tions 
certainly add greatly to the value of this series, 
presenting much information upon the places 
visited as well as data regarding the authors 
and the texts. Their value would be en- 
hanced, however, by more frequent citation 
of the sources from which the facts arc 
drawn. The notes are not free from mis- 
prints; some opportunities are missed, and 
occasional doubtful statements are foimd. In 
illustration, reference mav be made to the date 
1851 for 1853 (I., p. 21)"^; Blainville for Bien- 
ville (I., pp. 23, 59); '^ eomsmandant ' (I., p. 
56) ; ' Jesuits Eelation ' (II., 80). It is doubt- 
ful whether the editor of the ' Jesuit Relations ' 
should have stated that Lac des Puans (Stink- 
ing Lake) was a name used by the French for 
Green Bay (II., 186). When the word Lax: 
was used, the term was applied either to Lake 
Michigan or to Lake Winnebago. Evans's ref- 
erence to Colonel Pinkney (VIIL, p. 159) is 
confused by the editor's not© spelling the family 
name ' Pinckney.' As an example of neglect- 
ed opportunities may be instanced the fail- 
ure to explain the importance of the Black 
Swamp 'between the Sandusky and the ^lau- 
mee, in Harrison's operations in the War 
of 1812. Evans calls it 'famous' for this 
reason; but the note (VIIL, p. 196) fails to 
mention the military importance of the place. 
The maps of the various volumes are carefully 
reproduced, and the index, promised as the 
concluding volume of the thirty-one which are 
to make up the series, will be of great aid to 
students. The publishers have given the travels 
in these well-printed and substantially bound 
volumes an excellent setting. The large type, 
ample margins, and good paper, form a pleas- 
ing contrast to the original editions.

Some Humax REMiNiscENcrES.* 



Among those nuggets of philosophy scat- 
tered irrelevantly but not unacceptably through 
the pages of Thoreau's ' Week/ is the follow- 
ing: 'We do not learn much from learned 
books, but from true, sincere, human books, 
from frank and honest biographies.' A frank 
and human and at the same time most enter- 
taining book of the honest biographical, or 
rather autobiographical, kind is Mrs. Rebecca 
Harding Davis's ' Bits of Gossip,' a piece of 
writing whose only serious fault is that it is 
not longer. Mrs. Davis is best known, at least 
to older readers, by her story of ' Life in the 
Iron Milk," one of the earliest, and perhaps 
the most powerfully written, of the many sto- 
ries of laboring-class life in America. 

Passing her girlhood successively in western 
Pennsylvania, in one of the Gulf states, and in 
West Virginia, and her maturer years chiefly 
in Philadelphia, with interspersed sojourns in 
New England and elsewhere, Mrs. Davis views 
her fellow countrymen and women with no 
provincial narrowness of vision, and conmients 
on their sectional peculiarities with the large 
tolerance and understanding of one to whom 
fulness of years and wealth of experience have 
brought kindliness as well as wisdom. Espe- 
cially appreciative of excellences and tolerant 
of defects is she in her attitude toward the 
slaveholding Southerner of ante-bellum days, 
and his deadly enemy the abolitionist North- 
erner. Living on the neutral border as she 
did for some years before and during the war, 
this clear-eyed observer was able to see both 
sides of the perplexing question, — a far less 
comfortable frame of mind, as she truly 
remarks, than that of the thorough-going par- 
tisan. But a wise impartiality surely reaps its 
rewards in the end. In keeping with this 
unbiased attitude, — a coolness and fairness of 
judgment not too common in women, — is 
Mrs. Davis's delightfully honest and not too 
reverential treatment of the New England 
worthies whom sbe met on her first visit to Bos- 
ton and Concord. Here is the way she prefaces 
her recollections of them: 

'I wish I could summon these memorable ghosts 
before you as I saw them then and afterward. To 
the eyes of an observer, belonging to the common- 
place world, they did not appear precisely as they 
do in the portraits drawn of them for posterity by 
their companions, the other Areopagites, who walked 
and talked with them apart — always apart from 
humanity. That was the first peculiarity which 
struck an outsider in Emerson, Hawthorne, and the 
other members of the "Atlantic" coterie; that 
while they thought they were guiding the real 
world, they stood quite outside of it, and never 
would see it as it was.' 

* Bits of Gossip. By Rebecca Harding Davis. Boston : 
Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 



She is particularly severe on the ' would-be seer ' 
whose memorable achievement in carpentry 
was the rustic arbor he built for Emerson ' to 
do his thinking in,' — a very artistic and well- 
appointed structure, except that it had no door, 
and so no one could use it. To the lady from 
Virginia, this wonderful edifice seemed 'a fit- 
ting symbol for this guild of prophets and 
their scheme of life.' We have read much of 
Mr. Alcott's praise of vegetarianism. A page 
from Mrs. Davis's book may perhaps help us to 
rate these laudations at their true value. We 
quote, as the author has written, with no 
unkindness of purpose. Indeed, one can hardly 
help liking the amiable dreamer all the better 
after viewing his innocent absurdities through 
Mrs. Davis's eyes. 

'Early that morning, when his lank, gray figure 
had first appeared at the gate, Mr. Hawthorne said: 
"Here comes the Sage of Concord. He is anxious 
to know what kind of human beings come up from 
the back hills of Virginia. Now I will tell you," 
his eyes gleaming with fun, "what he will talk to 
you about. Pears. Yes. You may begin at Plato 
or the day's news, and he will come around to pears. 
He is now convinced that a vegetable diet affects 
both the body and soul, and that pears exercise a 
more direct and ennobling influence on us than any 
other vegetable or fruit. Wait, You'll hear pres- 
ently." When we went in to dinner, therefore, 1 
was surprised to see the sage eat heartily of the fine 
sirloin of beef set before us. But with the dessert 
he began to advocate a vegetable diet, and at last 
announced the spiritual influence of pears, to the 
great delight of his host, who laughed like a boy 
and was humored like one by the gentle old man. ' 

The Transcendentalists are one and all han- 
dled, not roughly, but certainly without gloves, 
by Mrs. Davis. Her estimate of them can be 
given in no better words than her own. 

'New England then swarmed with weak-brained, 
imitative folk who had studied books with more or 
less zeal,' and who knew nothing of actyal life. 
They were suffering under the curse of an education 
which they could not use; they were the lean, under- 
fed men and women of villages and farms, who 
were trained enough to be lawyers and teachers in 
their communities, but who actually were cobblers, 
mill-hands, or tailoresses. They had revolted from 
Puritanism, not to enter any other live church, but 
to fall into a dull disgust, a nausea with all religion. 
To them came this new prophet with his discovery 
of the God within themselves. They hailed it with 
acclamation. The new dialect of the Transcenden- 
talist was easily learned. They talked it as cor- 
rectly as the Chinaman does his pigeon English. Up 
to the old gray house among the pines in Concord 
they went — hordes of wild-eyed Harvard under- 
graduates and lean, underpaid working-women, each 
with a disease of soul to be cured by the new 
Healer. ' 

The author's presentation of the great ones 
of Boston and neighborhood is almost always 
shrewd, and furnishes excellent reading, how- 
ever much the reader may at times feel inclined 
to dissent. But when, in praise of Hawthorne, 
she denies to him all self -consciousness, and 



Sd4 



THE DIAIi 



[Nov. 16, 



writes that 'he prabaMy never knew that he 
was different' from those around him, and 
that ' he knew and cared little about Nathaniel 
Hawthorne/ one cannot suppress a word of 
emphatic disagreement. A man cannot spin 
romances out of his brain and drop his plummet 
into the hidden depths of our common human 
nature without gaining, from the introspection 
involved, some very real sense of his own capaci- 
ties and limitations, and an abiding conscious- 
ness of the awful mystery that each is to him- 
self even more than to his fellows. We linger 
perhaps unduly over this chapter on 'Boston 
in the Sixties,' but one more quotation demands 
insertion. It is a rather startling characteriza- 
tion of Thoreau by his friend Emerson. 

'He said to me suddenly once, "I wish Thoreau 
had not died before you came. He was an interest- 
ing study." "Why?" I asked. "Why? Thoreau?" 
He hesitated, thinking, going apparently to the bot- 
tom of the matter, and said presently: "Henry 
often reminded me of an animal in human form. 
He had the eye of a bird, the scent of a dog, the 
most acute, delicate intelligence, — but no soul. 
No," he repeated, shaking his head with decision, 
"Henry could not have had a human soul." ' 

It is refreshing to read an author so out of 
humor with the commercial spirit of the age as 
is Mrs. Davis. She was reared in a community 
where discussion of money matters was consid- 
ered vulgar, and any reference to one's own or 
one's neighbor's pecuniary condition the ex- 
treme of bad taste. She cherishes, too, the old- 
fashioned reverence for things sacred. 'With 
a conceit quite unconscious of its own absurd- 
ity,' she writes, ' each college boy and girl puts 
the Almighty and His Messenger to man on 
trial, and pronounces judgment on them.' Yet 
she is not without hope for the future even in 
this particular; for 'after all,' she says, 'we 
are a young nation, and vanity is a fault of 
youth. We will [t. e. shall] grow out of it 
presently.' 

Writing of those who wrought for the free- 
ing of the slave, she speaks as follows of Low- 
ell, Whittier, and Beecher: 

' Lowell 's politics and poetry were, as a rule, kept 
inside of his books. He himself in every-day life 
was so simple, so sincere, so human, that you forgot 
he had any higher calling than that of being the 
most charming of companions. Mr. Whittier, on the 
contrary, was always the poet and the Abolitionist. 
He did not consciously pose, but he never for a 
moment forgot his mission. He was thin, mild, and 
ascetic, looking like a Presbyterian country minis- 
ter. He gave his views of slavery and the South 
with a gentle, unwearied obstinacy, exasperating to 
anyone who knew that there was another side to 
the question. I never saw a human being with a 
personality more aggressive than that of Henry 
Ward Beecher. . . He had an enormous following 
of men and a few women. But, back of the heavy 
jaws and thick lips and searching eyes swathed in 
drooping lids, back of the powerful intellect and 
tender sympathy, there was a nameless something 
in Mr. Beecher which repelled most women. You 



resolved obstinately not to agree with his argu- 
ment, not to laugh or cry with him, not to see him 
again. Perhaps it is ungracious in me to tell this. 
But I cannot give the impression he made without 
it. He was always Dr. Fell to me, in spite of his 
strength and the wonderful charm of his sympathy 
with every living creature.' 

After this avowal of temperamental antipathy 
to Beecher, one is not surprised to learn that 
Mrs. Davis was no worshipper of Walt Whit- 
man. To her, ' Whitman simply was indecent, 
as thousands of other men are indecent, who 
are coarse by nature and vulgar by breeding.' 
Many interesting things are related of Clay and 
Blaine, the former of whom was the political 
idol of her youth, and the latter a distant cousin 
and a fellow resident of Washington, Pa., her 
birthplace. She writ^ with every advantage 
of an intimate and lifelong acquaintance; but 
when she declares of Blaine that this 'melan- 
choly idler ... at heart did not care whether 
he ever entered the White House or not,' we are 
not entirely convinced. By the way, to refer 
to Washington, Pa., is about as definite as 
referring to Smithville or Farmington, U. S., 
as there are twenty-three Washingtons in Penn- 
sylvania, according to Lippdncott's Gazetteer. 
But the context makes it reasonably certain that 
Washington of Washington County is meant. 
Another criticism may be ventured in this same 
field of geography. Why does the author invar- 
iably spell Culpeper (the Virginia county and 
town) with three p's ? The Virginians of that 
district are, we believe, rather careful to dis- 
tinguish their county and county-seat from the 
condiment containing three labials. 

Mrs. Davis has given us a little book that is 
sane and wise and cheerful, as well as enter- 
taining. Perhaps one reason why she is so good 
a romancer is that she has so firm a hold on 
reality and so keen a scent for sham and hum- 
bug; and she clothes her reality in so attractive 
a guise because she is quick to see the romantic 
in character and situation.

the history of Europe between the fall of the 
Eoman Empire and the Eenaissance is an elabo- 
rate fable worked out in a widely ramified liter- 
ary conspiracy of the Benedictine monasteries. 
With the self-interest of the Benedictines as a 
pou sto, the author easily heaves the medisBval 
world, as we assume to know it, out of exist- 
ence. 

The boolc, a generously handsome octavo of 
over 600 pages, consists of a memoir of its 
author by Edward A. Petherick, a Part I. 
devoted to the Benedictines and their varied 
activities, and a Part II. devoted to following 
their trail through the historical writings of 
the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. 
Why the book, written ten years before the 
author's death, was not printed until nearly 
three years after his death, is nowhere appar- 
ent. 

From Mr. Petherick's memoir we learn that 
the book is the last of a series: ^Antiqua 
Mater,' ' The Rise of Christendom,' and ' The 
Rise of English Culture.' ' Coming sud- 
denly, after months of earnest research, upon a 
clue, it was gradually revealed to him that the 
actual writers of the Church and Gospel his- 
tories were not ancient. Not one only, or a few 
only, of the supposed ancient writers seemed 
to write in a sixteenth^entury manner, as 
Canon Westcott had remarked of Jerome : 
nearly all of them belonged to that late period.' 
What the clue is, is not very clear. But Pethe- 
rick makes much of the fact that both Bryce 
and Freeman comment on the absence of mediae- 
val monuments in Rome; and regarding Pales- 
tine, he makes such assertions as this : ' Other 
inscriptions have been found in abundance, but 
not a single Hebrew word.' 

Here we may turn to Mr. Johnson himself. 
Mr. Johnson places the seat of Judaism in 
Spain. Here about the year 1200, ' Maimonides 
gave the Jews a Creed; and it was near to Mai- 
monides' time that the Hebrew Scriptures were 
written, beg'an to be recited in the Synagogues 
and to be commented on by the Rabbins. . . 
Now, the Benedictine corporation could not 
have come into existence before the Hebrew 
Scriptures were in some version known to them, 
because they base their system of teaching upon 
a certain interpretation of those Scriptures. . . 
[The Benedictines] constructed out of their 
study of "the Old Testament," as they called 
the Hebrew Scriptures, another book which they 
chose to call " the New Testament." ' The Bene- 
dictine Order, like its older rival the Syn- 
agogue, invented a charter, a quasi divine 
patent for their greed and rapacity. But they 
did more. They planned and executed a multi- 
farious fable, — first, to fill out an assumed 
antiquity of the Order ; secondly, over and 
over again 'to define the dogma of the Order 



by setting up an imaginary heretic to teach its 
opposite'; thirdly, to secure material advan- 
tages to themselves by feigning long established 
use of possessions and tributes. ' And who can 
dispossess his memory of the saying put into the 
mouth of the genial and secular-minded Pope 
Leo X., — " How profitable to us that fable of 
Jesu^ Christ ! " ' 

From among the names which the author 
attaints by means of quotation marks, we may 
cull the following : ' St. Augustine,' ' Tertul- 
lian,' ' St. Basil the Great,' ' Isidore of Seville,' 
'Eusebius Pamphili,' 'St. Gregory the Great,' 
' Thomas Aquinas,' ' Scotus,' ' Gregory of 
Tours,' ' Bede,' ' Alcuin,' ' Lanf ranc,' ' Anselm,' 
'Wiclif,' 'Charlemagne,' 'Alfred the Great,' 
'William the Conqueror.' Columbus was in- 
vented to derive to the monks the glory of a 
discovery really made later and at first doubted 
and flouted by them. 

The second part of the book is the one to 
which the title of the whole work is properly 
applicable. Five chapters are devoted to Poly- 
dore Vergil as a critic and dupe. Specific 
adulterations are pointed out and explained as 
allegories of what was going on in Henry 
VIII.'s reign. E. g., ' The law Ne exeas regno 
is put in force when required, under Henry- 
VIII. It also is traced up to the tyrannic sys- 
tem of exaction and confiscation under Rufus. 
. . Norman fable again proves to be Tudor 
fact.' In the chapter on Leland, the author 
argues that Chaucer is the syndicate name of 
a number of Tudor wits ; and in the next chap- 
ter, on Early Printed Books, that Caxton is an 
hypostasis of the printing confraternity, the 
Benedictine hoof being visible in the printer's 
use of the word chapel. The Inns of Courts 
were a school of poetry, for the law-books that 
should have been studied had not yet been 
invented. In the chapter on Public Records, 
the existence of such records before the Tudor 
period is with much circumstance denied. The 
Bible in England, The New Testament, Poets 
and Critics, — whatever the heading, the tenor 
of the Chapter is the same. The tale, indeed, 
becomes monotonous. The conclusion is nerve- 
less by comparison with the main thesis: it is 
hardly more than a homily on the Truth of 
Letters and Science and the rival Truth pro- 
claimed by the Church; and there is a curious 
intimation that in America and the Colonies 
the Truth of Letters and Science will be estab- 
lished. 

That this book will strike the trained scholar 
as preposterous, is certain at the outset. But 
the author is himself a trained scholar, a man 
of great erudition and some method. Thus the

believe it with unswerving fatuity. By com- 
parison with them, it seems worthy of a matter- 
of-fax3t refutation. Such a refutation would be 
the proper task of an historian. In one way, 
however, it may best be made by ancillary 
sciences. A breath of one of these may prove 
more potent than the shock of a phalanx of 
the enemy — here, accepted historical criticism. 
Let us then take a look at the philological 
aspect of the author's theory. The theory 
implies, and the author elsewhere explicitly 
states, that ' Anglo-Saxon letters are a sixteenth 
century invention.' Surely, the author could 
have had no idea of what such a statement car- 
ried with it. It means the invention of archaic 
forms of language such that scholars three hun- 
dred years later could work out a chronological 
and geographical gradation of forms, a many- 
branched linguistic history covering a thousand 
years ; this history, moreover, agreeing in prin- 
ciple with the history of other Germ'anic lan- 
guages, and also with that of the Romance and 
the classical languages. It means the inven- 
tion of forms which show, when observed in the 
established chronology, phonetic changes con- 
formable to physiological laws not understood 
until three hundred and fifty years after the 
supposed invention, and of forms unintelligible 
as forms to any comparison with cognate 
tongues, yet perfectly clear when, three hundred 
years after the supposed invention, Sanskrit 
and the earlier forms of Latin and Greek came 
to be studied. The invention of an historical 
system of men, events, laws, and customs, which 
Mr. Johnson attributes to the Benedictines, is 
an act of human intellect far outstripping the 
greatest yet known — the Ptolemaic system of 
astronomy. But the incidental invention of the 
multifarious phenomena of Germanic and 
Romanic linguistics outstrips the historical 
fabulation far more than that outstrips the

Grimm and Sievers and Sweet would no doubt 
enjoy converse with the abbot whose stupendous 
genius uttered this truly Jehovan fiat. 

Non liquet. But even if it did, of what use 
could such a Babel made-to-measure have been ? 
The phenomenon we call umlaut, for instance, 
adds no whit of credibility to any part of this 
alleged fabrication. The supererogation of the 
invention is quite as unparalleled as the inven- 
tion itself would have been. Again, the Bene- 
dictines, or qui que ce soit, might have in- 
vented Chaucerian metrics from sixteenth- 
century English and French usage. But why 
should they have invented alliterative verse, 
— or, inventing it, why did they invent such 
distinct varieties of it as are exemplified in 
Langland, in Genesis A and Old English poetry 



generally, and in Genesis B and the continental 
poetry generally ? Why did they think it neces- 
sary to have a Latin Bede and also a vernacular 
Bede, — why a Boethius in the Alf redian ver- 
nacular and a quite independent Boethius in the 
Chaucerian vernacular? All, all supereroga- 
tion; and wholly unbelievable, even if it served 
a useful end in the fahle convenue. 

The author of this misguided work has 
strained at an historical gnat and swallowed 
a philological camel. Very likely he has swal- 
lowed besides an architectural camel, a chrono- 
logical camel, kitchen-middings, and what not 
else. Every expert along the boundaries of his- 
tory would probably give testimony as damag- 
ing as that of the philologian. But the testi- 
mony of philology alone will at least suffice to 
bring in the Scotch verdict, ' Not proven.'

New liETTERS OF Elia.* 



Sixty-seven years have passed since Thomas 
Noon Talfourd, acting in the capacity of liter- 
ary executor, presented to the public a slender 
volume containing all the letters of Charles 
Lamb that were then deemed suitable for pub- 
lication. Eleven years later, the death of Mary 
Lamb was followed by Talfourd's 'Final 
jMemorials,' revealing the tragic and tender 
story of the Lambs. Since that far-away day 
succeeding editors, — Hazlitt, FitzGerald, Lu- 
cas, and Ainger, — have garnered stray letters, 
almost one by one, until now this latest edition 
comprises no less than four hundred and sixty- 
eight epistles, — and still 'makes no claim to 
be complete.' 

Since the publication in 1888 of the first 
Ainger edition, many letters have come to light, 
most of them appearing in the Macmillan edi- 
tion de luxe of 1900. These are all included 
in the present edition, but devoted Elians will 
be chiefly grateful for the publication here of 
the hitherto unprinted series of sixteen letters 
written by Lamh to John Rickman, one of the 
best loved of the ' Wednesday ' men. 

The first of these Rickman letters is written 
in September, 1801, from Margate, whither 
Charles and IMary had gone ' to drink sea water 
and pick up shells.' Lamb whimsically com- 
plains of the treatment accorded his contribu- 
tions to the ' Morning Chronicle.*

known handwriting was enough to drive away any 
nonsense current. I believe I shall give up this 
way of writing, and turn honest, scramble on as 
well as I can for a year, and make a Book, for 
why should every creature make books but I?' 
The gentle irony of Lamb, so familiar to us, 
is never long missing. 

'G. Burnett had just finished his essay when I 
came away. Mushrooms scramble up in a night; but 
diamonds, you know, lie a long while ripening in

that opinions tending to the subversion of Estab-

cine, etc., should not be rashly vented in every com- 
pany: a good orthodox doctrine which has been 
preached up with the "holy text of Pike and Gun" 
with you in Ireland, and is pretty familiar in Eng- 
land, but is novel to George; at least he never wrote 
an Essay upon that subject before. Critics should 
think of this, before they loosely cry out, This is

all new to the Author, he may never have thought

brain-sweat as a piece of the most inveterate origi- 
nality. ' 

Another of the new letters begins, ' Your 
goose found her way into our Larder with 
infinite discretion.^ A letter addressed to Mrs. 
Rickman gives a hint of Lamb's book-hunting 
propensity, and almost certainly refers to the 
' Poetry for Children,' a book rarely to be met 
with even then. 'Will you regive or lend me,

One misses in this edition Lamb's letter of 
proposal to Frances Maria Kelley, and the truly 
noble one that followed her declination of his 
offer of marriage, — a serious omission, but 
perhaps an unavoidable one.

they contain, and as an evidence of the sus-

two handsome volumes will be welcomed by 
every lover of ' Elia.'

Negro Slavery in Illinois.* 

In the work under review we have in the 
fullest detail an account of negro servitude 
in Illinois, one of the states supposed by the 
student of school histories to have been pre- 
served by the Ordinance of 1787 from the 
blighting influence of slavery. In the early 
chapters, the author traces the history of negro 
slavery during the period of the French and 
English occupation, and during the existence 
of the territorial and state governments, to the 
period of anti-slavery agitation that began in 
the '30's. The judicial decisions are explained 
in detail, until the final decisions destroyed 
negro servitude in Illinois. Much the greater 
part of the volume is devoted to the histor}^ 
of the anti-slavery agitation and its local mani- 
festations in the state, and to the rise of the 
several political parties that made use of the 
abolition sentiment. A final chapter sketches 
the progress, or rather the lack of progress, of 
popular sentiment in regard to the negro. A 
complete and scientific bibliography is ap- 
pended. In the appendix are also some inter- 
esting papers relating to Illinois slavery, — sale 
papers, indentures, and letters from the masters 
of slaves. A table is given showing the growth 
of the anti-slaverv vote, from 160 in 1840 to 
172,196 in 1860. 'The illustrations consist of a 
photograph of the Lovejoy monument at Alton, 
a reproduction of an Underground Railway 
advertisement, likenesses of several anti-slavery 
agitators (the two Love joys, Lyman Trumbull, 
Zebina Eastman, and Abraliam Lincoln), and, 
very lonely in that company, Stephen A. Doug- 
las. 

Of slavery in Illinois as a social institution, 
Mr. Harris says almost nothing. His concern 
is with the legal status of the negroes. Negro 
slavery was introduced into the Illinois country 
by the French; the English conquest in 1763 
did not affect slavery, nor were property rights 
disturbed by Virginia, which gained the terri- 
tory during the Revolution. Virginia ceded 
her claims to the United States on condition 
that all inhabitants be allowed to retain all 
their possessions and their ancient rights. The 
Ordinance of 1787 guaranteed the continuation 
of these rights and at the same time prohibited 
slavery in the Northwest Territory. This anti- 
slavery clause was interpreted by Congress, by 
the territorial governors, and by the people, as 
prohibiting the introduction of more slaves, — 
not as destroying slavery in the territory and 
hence making it free territory, nor as prohibit- 
ing limited servitude. Consequently, from this 
time until 1848, when slavery was destroyed by

a new constitution, there were three classes of 
negroes in Illinois, — slaves for life, belonging 
to the French settlers and their descendants; 
indentured servants, bound to a master for a 
term of years, often as long as life; and free 
negroes with no civil status. A slave-owner 
from Virginia or Kentucky might come into 
Illinois with his slaves, and by a process of 
registration, supposedly ' voluntary ' on the part 
of the negroes, change them into servants 
bound for terms of two to ninety-nine years. 
Thus the substance of slavery was preserved, 
under a different form, and in spite of the 
Ordinance of 1787. To regulate the slaves and 
indentured servants, a code of laws, borrowed 
from the slave codes of Virginia and Kentucky, 
was drawn up in 1803. These * Black Laws' 
remained on the statute-books until repealed, 
as late as February 7, 1865. This code regu- 
lated the treatment of the servants, their food 
and clothes, term of service, and punishment; 
it provided for a pass system, and made it 
illegal for whites to trade with them. The 
servants had no standing in law. Under this 
code, they were bought, sold, and bequeathed 
by will, as if they were Mississippi slaves; and 
the prices paid — $300 to $600 for boys and 
girls, and $800 to $1,000 for men — prove that 
the limitations on servitude had little effect on 
the value of the slave. 

In 1818, when the state constitution was 
formed, probably a majority of the Illinois set- 
tlers wanted a pro-slavery constitution; but, 
from motives of expediency, the one adopted 
allowed only a limited servitude except in the 
case of the French slaves. However, there were 
many who wanted unlimited negro slavery ; and 
from 1820 to 1824 there was a contest to secure 
two-thirds of the legislature in order to have a 
convention called which, it was expected, would 
revise the constitution and legally establish 
negro slavery. The necessary number was 
secured; but a majority of the people, some 
of them disgusted by the methods of the con- 
vention party, voted against having a conven- 
tion, the vote being 6,640 to 4,972. 

This victory decided that immigration to Illi- 
nois should be from the East, and not from the 
South ; the Southerner did not feel safe in risk- 
ing his negro property under the laws of Illi- 
nois. Yet there was then no anti-slavery 
movement; in fact, the laws and court decisions 
gradually strengthened the master's hold upon 
his servants. In 1828, the Supreme Court 
decided that the Ordinance of 1787 was not 
binding upon the state of Illinois, having been 
suspended by the constitution of 1818. It 
further decided that 'registered servants are 
goods and chattels, and can be sold on execu- 
tion.' But about 1835, influenced by the grow- 
ing anti-slavery sentiment, the courts began to 



limit the operation of the ' Black Laws ' by 
enforcing registration, by declaring the children 
of servants to be free, by reversing the decision 
of 1828 which declared that servants were chat- 
tels, by forbidding the sale of servants, and 
finally, in 1843, by deciding that residence in 
a free state made a free man of a slave volun- 
tarily brought in by his master. The courts of 
Mississippi, Louisiana, and Missouri had al- 
ready asserted this principle. In 1844, the rem- 
nant of French slavery was abolished by the 
courts. All servitude not imposed by the state 
was destroyed by the constitution of 1848, and 
in 1864 the supreme court decided that the state 
could not sell a free negro immigrant into 
slavery. So the last negro became free a 
year before Lincoln died. The laws of Illinois 
were always in favor of slavery until 1865 ; the 
supreme court until about 1835 was pro-slavery, 
and after that date was controlled by anti- 
slavery sentiment rather than guided by law or 
precedent. 

But while the slaves were thus gaining free- 
dom through the courts the laws and public 
opinion were making the position of the free 
negro unbearable. He was ill-treated and 
scorned and abused in all places; he had no 
standing in the courts, no rights, civil or politi- 
cal, and though forced to pay taxes he was not 
allowed to send his children to school. In order 
not to be sold into servitude, he must have a 
certificate of freedom, and must furnish a 
thousand-dollar bond that he would not become 
a public charge. There was much opposition to 
the presence of the free negroes, and the con- 
stitution of 1848, which destroyed domestic 
slavery, gave the legislature autiiority to pre- 
vent free negro immigration. This article of 
the constitution was adopted by a majority of 
28,182; and in 1853 a law was passed to 
enforce it by selling free negro immigrants into 
servitude. In spite of all anti-slavery agitation, 
the sentiment of the people did not soften 
toward the free negro. A proposed constitution 
was rejected in 1862, by 16,051 majority; 
yet an article of that constitution forbid- 
ding the immigration of negroes was accepted 
by a majority of 100,590, and an article pro- 
hibiting negro suffrage was adopted by a ma- 
jority of 176,271, only 35,649 voting against 
it. tinder such influences, the free negro pop- 
ulation did not increase rapidly, many prefer- 
ring to remain slaves ; many of the free negroes 
were kidnapped by thrifty Illinoisians and sold 
to the Southern planters. The position of the 
negro since emancipation has improved but lit- 
tle, the author thinks, although the unfavorable 
laws have disappeared from the statute-books. 

In tracing the rise of anti-slavery- sentiment 
in Illinois, Mr. Harris does not clearly distin- 
ffuish between the various kinds of anti-slavery

people. Some were opposed to slavery in Illi- 
nois; others to slavery anywhere; some wanted 
no negroes at all in the state, othersi wanted 
only free negroes; some were abolitionists from 
moral reasons, others because of politics, and 
still others because of economic reasons. All 
of these Mr. Harris puts together as anti-sla- 
very men, or abolitionists. In reality, there was 
little genuine anti-slavery sentiment in Illinois 
until the late '50's. Most of the people wanted 
no negroes, slave or free, but were not inclined 
to meddle with slavery in the South. This is 
proved by the Lovejoy episode, and by the fact 
that an anti-slavery organization could not be 
maintained nor an anti-slavery paper be sup- 
ported. The attempts at founding an anti- 
slavery political party resulted in failure until 
1856. Slavery in Illinois politics was hardly 
a moral issue, in spite of the efforts of the 
author to show high moral motives in the anti- 
slavery politicians. Much space is devoted to 
anti-slavery politics; every platform and every 
vote is given, every candidate named, but, with 
few exceptions, it looks like a case of the * Outs ' 
trying to become the ' Ins,' and slavery is used 
as a good weapon in the struggle. We discount 
the sympathy expressed for the Southern slave, 
when we know that nothing whatever was done 
for the few free negroes in their midst. Dislike 
for the master led the abolitionist to aid run- 
away slaves, but the latter must not stop in 
the state; no voice was raised for the free negro. 
We should now admire those abolitionists more 
had they succored the wretches at their own 
doors instead of stirring up the flames of sec- 
tional hatred by the course they pursued. A 
queer instance of their ethics is shown in the 
Lovejoy episode : Lovejoy, seeing that no good 
was likely to come of his agitation, wrote a 
letter resigning the editorship of the abolition 
paper at Alton. The letter was to be published, 
but an intimate friend suppressed it, and con- 
sequently Ix)vejoy went on to his death at the 
hands of the mob. 

The peculiar composition of the population of 
Illinois materially influenced politics. The 
central and southern counties were controlled 
by men of Southern birth or descent ; the north- 
em counties were settled from the East, and 
were usually opposed in politics to the southern 
part. Most of the negroes were in the southern 
counties. To favor negro immigration was to 
favor the political opposition, and naturally 
the Northern settler opposed anything that 
would strengthen the Southern settlers or cause 
more of them to come into the state. Mr. Har- 
ris would have done well had he traced more 
thoroughly the sectional influences in the state ; 
a few good maps would reconcile his readers to 
the omission of the illustrations used. 

The author is decidedlv abolitionist in his 



sympathies; for the pro-slavery Democrats and 
the Southern settlers he shows slight respect. 
A wealth of adjectives enables him to express 
his appreciation of the former and his dislike 
of the latter, yet this feeling seems almost 
colorless; the dry recital of names, dates, and 
platforms causes one to welcome these expres- 
sions of opinions, which seem rather to be inher- 
ited than formed as a result of knowledge. Mr. 
Harris proceeds upon the assumption that the 
faith of the anti-slavery men was always good, 
their motives pure and unselfish, their char- 
acter and intelligence above the average ; but 
he is suspicious of all that pertains to their 
opponents, and is inclined to believe them guilty 
of the secret plans and treacherous methods 
that went out with dynastic politics. Of the 
aboKtionists he says : * The spirit displayed by 
these men was admirable, and worthy of a noble 
cause.' * Enough cannot be said in praise of 
the self sacrifice, the patient perseverance, the 
conscientious devotion to duty, the high sense 
of political honor, and withal the genial liber- 
ality of these men.' Of the Southern.' element 
in the population, he says that those from the 
Carolinas and Georgia were ' ignorant, shiftless, 
and obstinate,' ' imscruipulous and dishonest'; 
' Andrew Borders, a man well-known for his 
cruelty and rapacity, ... a true Southerner'; 
'these people [of Southern Illinois] were as 
narrow-minded and stubborn as they were kind- 
hearted and hospitable.' He says that the 
negro is still persecuted as of old, and ' a state 
of affairs very similar to that in the South 
exists there.' It is but fair to say that these 
expressions of feeling do not seem to be the 
result of personal prejudice, but rather the 
reflection of the spirit of the time caught from 
research among its documents, or acquired 
through tradition as a matter of course, like 
the small Southern bo/s belief that 'Yankees 
have horns,' or the opinion of the New York 
schoolboy that ' Southern people are blaek and 
lazy.' 

Mr. Harris evidently does not know his negro 
except through documents; he states that 'to 
a white man all negroes look alike,' and he 
locates Hampton Institute in North Carolina. 
No attention is paid to the influence of eco- 
nomic forces that were working for the extinc- 
tion of slavery; the anti-slavery and anti-negro 
sentiments of the Southern settlers (like Lin- 
coln), who fled from slavery, are not considered 
important ; the almost universal ' lily white ' 
feeling, and its importance, escaped him alto- 
gether ; with him, the task was to work out the 
anti-slavery history of Illinois as a moral and 
humanitarian movement, which it was not, to 
any great degree. The result is that we have 
all the facts, but the collector was unable to 
interpret them; he really did not understand

What is Known of Earthquakes.* 

The study of earthquakes, from the view- 
point of the new seismology, must be consid- 
ered as somewhat technical. For such a study 
is really a branch of physics, and concerns itself 
with the laws of the propagation of waves in 
the solid body of the earth. To treat this sub- 
ject in such fashion that it will be as pleasant 
and easy to master as an ordinary novel, is 
quite an impossible feat. Nevertheless, Major 
Button, whose reputation as a student of geol- 
ogy and an investigator of earthquakes is inter- 
national, has succeeded in explaining and pop- 
ularizing the new seismology in a noteworthy 
degree, in his recent book upon that subject. 
In a very few cases, a formula, modest in 
dimensions and easy to understand, finds its 
way into the text, and saves much circumlocu- 
tion; but the book is practically free from 
mathematical symbols. 

The introductory chapter aims to acquaint 
the reader with the general terms used in the 
discussion of these phenomena, and to describe 
the various ways in which an earthquake com- 
monly manifests itself. The author then 
explains the two principal causes of earth- 
quakes, which are volcanic action and the mys- 
terious force which shows itself in various (Us- 
locations of the earth's crust, such as mountain 
building and other displacements which might 
be caused by gradual contraction of the earth, 
or by subterranean influences of the precise 
nature of which we are ignorant. The most 
dreadful earthquakes are shown to be non-vol- 
canic in origin. 

The best modern instruments for detecting 
quakes, and also for measuring the complex 
motions of the earth's surface during these 
disturbances, are described in detail, and the 
four sorts of waves produced are discussed. 
The different scal^ used for measuring the 
intensity of shocks are explained, and the 
speeds of the various kinds of waves are deter- 
mined. It is shown that all recorded earth- 
quakes originate at depths probably never as 
great as twenty miles. Yet the vibration? 
caused are, in the case of great quakes, trans- 
mitted through and around the earth to dis- 
tances of thousands of miles. 

The determination of the speeds at which

the different classes of vibrations travel is a 
difficult matter, and is of the highest impor- 
tance in revealing the nature of the earth's 
interior. Major Button therefore devotes three 
chapters to this part of the subject. One of 
the conclusions drawn is that the more deeply 
rocks lie imbedded in the earth's crust, the 
more elastic and rigid they are. On the whole, 
the rigidity of the earth must be very great. 

Two of the closing chapters of the book treat 
of the geographical distribution of earthquakes ; 
it appears that they are most frequent where 
the earth's crust is most rugged and highly 
diversified in profile. The final chapter is 
devoted to the very interesting topic of * sea- 
quakes.' This term is applied, to peculiar agita- 
tions of the sea which cause ships to tremble, 
and are often accompanied by a strange roar 
emanating from the water ; they are due to any 
force which lifts or depresses the sea-bottom or 
the littoral. The exhaustive tables of De Mon- 
tessus de Ballore, founded upon reliable data 
from 131,292 quakes, showing the geographical 
distribution of seismicity, are inserted as an 
appendix. The book is packed with many 
deteils which it is impossible to mention in 
limited space. The typographical dress of the 
volume, and the excellence of the full-page 
plates and other illustrations which adorn it, 
Ijefit the sterling merits of the work.

if not exactly of flagging energies, at least of a 
lack of that concentration of power which the 
most serious art demands. No such apology as 
this, however, need be made for 'The Son of 
Royal Langbrith,' which is the latest of his long 
series of novels. In this work he appears before 
the public at his highest and surest, joining with 
the invention and grasp of his best early books 
a heightened degree of that i-eflective rip>eness 
which comes only with the advancing years. It 
is one of the finest books he has ever written; 
one of the best American novels of our time. 
The situation depicted is old enough, although 
the publishers naively describe it as 'new in fic- 
tion '; but this offers no bar to our satisfaction. 
The oldest situations are apt to be the best, and 
the only fair criterion of judgment must be, not 
the choice of the situation, but the use that is 
made of it. The story is of James Langbrith, 
who has been brought up to revere the memory 
of the father whom he lost in childhood. This 
ancestor-worship has become with him a sort of 
cult, and he loves to dwell upon the sturdy vir- 
tues and quiet philanthropies in the exercise of 
which the father had made himself a shining 
example to his fellow-men. But the real facts 
of the case are that this same father was an 
unmitigated scoundrel, who built up his own 
fortunes at the expense of others, and who posed 
as a pillar of resi>ectability while leading a dis- 
solute life. When the son grows up and is 
graduated from Harvard, these facts are known 
to only three people in the little manufacturing 
town which is the scene of the novel. One is his 
long-suffering mother, who has never dared to 
undeceive him; the other two are the dead man's 
brother (now in charge of his mills) and the old 
family physician. For the rest of the community 
—the young and the new-comers— the old pious 
legend of Royal Langbrith 's virtues is as fixed 
a fact as the patriotism of George Washington. 
Thus is raised the moral problem with which 
Mr. Howells has chosen to deal. That he deals 
with it subtly and judiciously, allowing a fair 
hearing to all the conflicting considerations, is a 
matter of course. Just how the problem is 
worked out is of less importance than the way 
in which it is put,— a way which is strikingly 
that of Dr. Ibsen's 'Ghosts,' although in the 
present case there is no problem of heredity 
superadded to make the outcome horrible. But 
the truth has to be revealed, and when it 
has been revealed,— by accident, as it were, 
rather than of set purpose on the part of 
those who have kept it hidden,— Ave see clearly 
enough how sophistical were the reasonings of 
those who, knowing what it was, had advised 
that it be left buried forever. Fortunately, the 
revelation brings with it no need of tragedy, and 
its chastening effect upon the enlightened son 
seems to be just what that young man needs 
for the shaping of his character. 

There is one situation to which the novelist 
can always have recourse when others fail him, 
—the situation offered by the marriage of a 
strong man to a weak woman, or of a weak man 
to a strong woman. It is always possible t-> 



treat this relation with some degree of fresh- 
ness, because the variations upon the theme are 
practically inexhaustible. Mr. Robert Herrick's 
'The Common Lot' is based upon this relation, 
and he has chosen to depict the latter of the 
two possible cases. The man of his book is a 
young architect, bent upon worldly success, and 
gradually yielding to one temptation after 
another until a sort of dry-rot has come to 
permeate his entire moral organism. The woman 
has a character of Puritan sensitiveness in mat- 
ters of right and wrong, but she makes the too- 
frequent mistake of idealizing the man whom 
she loves, until first instinct and then proof of 
a more sensible nature gradually do their work 
of disillusionment. When she learns the truth, 
she deserts her husband until such time as he 
shall realize his degradation and seek her for- 
giveness. The climax comes with the destruc- 
tion by fire of a hotel building of the architect's 
construction, and the loss of many lives. It 
was a contractor'? building, dishonestly erected 
Avith the connivance of the architect. This trag- 
edy opens his eyes to the true meaning of the 
practices into which he has fallen, and by con- 
fession and restitution he makes what tardy 
reparation is within his power. Reunited with 
his wife, he starts to rebuild his broken career— 
this time upon an honest foundation; and there 
the story ends. We hesitate to call it the best of 
Mr. Herrick's books, because we think highly of 
the others; but it is without doubt a strong piece 
of work, such as few of our novelists could hope 
to equal. It has much variety of character and 
scene, almost photographically observed, and it 
has many interesting incidents of secondary 
importance; but its chief virtue is to be found 
in the impressiveness with which it presents the 
ethical problem, and enforces (by artistic impli- 
cation) the teaching that the moral life is a 
unity,— that conduct cannot be a matter of com- 
partments, but that each of our acts must affect 
all the others for good or for evil. 

'There arose a smothered feline screech as 
from a tiger whose back is broken in a dead- 
fall. Richard gave his wrist the shadow of a 
twist, and Snorri fell on one knee. Then, as 
though it were some foul thing, Richard tossed 
aside Snorri 's hand, from the nails of which 
blood came oozing in black drops as large as 
grapes. ' In such fashion does heroism cope with 
villainy in the first chapter of 'The President,' 
and thus are we assured that virtue will be 
triumphant in the end. Those who like their 
fiction highly-colored and strenuous will find their 
account in this melodramatic tale by Mr. Alfred 
Henry Lewis. Snorri is a Russian of the deep- 
est dye, who seeks to marry the daughter of 
Senator Hanway, and to loot the United States 
Treasury by tunnelling beneath its foundations. 
Richard, who is a multi-millionaire incognito, 
seeks the hand of the same young woman, and 
thwarts the burglarious designs of his desperate 
rival with a degree of success as shining as 
Snorri 's discomfiture is black. These are but 
sample elements of the interest with which the 
novel is crammed. We have also such matters

as the revenge of an outraged woman, a colossal 
stock-jobbing operation, and an intrigue for the 
presidency. This political feature, which we 
mention last, is really the substance of the book, 
which takes us to the seats of the mighty at 
Washington, and bids us behold the inner work- 
ings of the great confidence-game which is called 
polities. Mr. Lewis has no style to speak of, 
but he has picturesque invention in plenty, and 
is anything but commonplace. 

Mr. Mark Lee Luther's new novel, 'The Mas- 
tery,' is a vigorous production, although it does 
not seem to us quite the equal of 'The Hench- 
man ' in interest. It is primarily a strictly local- 
ized story of New York politics, although it also 
embodies a love-story which crops out now and 
then when the exigencies of the political situa- 
tion permit the hero to spare a breathing-spell 
for sentiment. In the end, he proves equally 
triumphant in love and in politics. This sort of 
novel, the work of tense diction, nervous energy, 
and harsh actuality, is being produced in great 
quantities at the present time, and is not with- 
out a certain value. But the value is of the 
kind that belongs to journalism rather than to 
literature. 

Those who have read Mr. Harben's 'Abner 
Daniel,' and wished to have further acquaint- 
ance with that shrewd rustic, have only to turn 
to 'The Georgians' for the satisfaction of their 
desires. These books are of the sort that exist 
almost wholly for the sake of a single character, 
—in the present case, for the sake of the story- 
telling busybody whose quaint humor saves 
every critical situation, and whose persuasive 
methods dissolve every difficulty. With Abner's 
dialect stories eliminated, 'The Georgians' would 
prove a thin enough performance, although there 
is sufficient pretence of connected plot to keep 
the book from absolute incoherency. 

The supply of Civil War stories shows no signs 
of giving out. One of the best of them is 'My 
Lady of the North,' by Mr. Randall Parrish. 
As the title indicates, the heroine is a Federal 
sympathizer, which makes it obvious that the 
hero must be a Confederate. It would be a tame 
sort of romance that should forego the oppor- 
timities offered by this opposition for exciting 
adventure, generosity toward the adversary, and 
final union after the war is over. The scene of 
this novel is Virginia ; the time the closing years 
of the confiict. It is all done upon the conven- 
tional pattern, and very well done. The senti- 
mental agony is prolonged by the device of 
leaving the hero to suppose that the heroine is 
the wife of his bitterest foe, when she is in 
reality only his sister-in-law and a widow. 

Sequels are proverbially dangerous things to 
attempt, but Mr. George B. McCutcheon's 'Bev- 
erly of Graustark,' which is a sequel to his first 
successful novel, has taken no great risks. Both 
books are absurd from every point of view except 
that of invention, and invention is about all the 
saving grace that is called for by the class of 
readers whose interest they enlist. In the new 
romance, we are again transported to the remote 
kingdom of Graustark, this time in the company 



of an American girl from Washington, whose 
words and ways give piquancy to the narrative^ 
Most of the weirdly-named characters of the 
earlier work reappear, and the special senti- 
mental interest is provided by the girl Beverly 
and the brigand-prince Dantan who eventually 
comes to his own in both senses. It is a harm- 
less sort of book, capable of affording an hour of 
agreeable diversion. 

Mr. Edward Mott Woolley's 'Roland of Alten- 
burg' is another romance of the 'Graustark' 
sort, somewhat less prolific in invention, but con- 
forming more closely to the conventional type of 
this kind of artificial composition in matters of 
diction and stage-setting. It is a story that 
makes some pretence of taking itself seriously; 
whereas Mr. McCutcheon's productions rather 
produce the impression of being innocent jokes 
at the reader's expense. In this book, Prince 
Roland, travelling incognito in America, meets 
the young woman whom fate has destined to be 
his consort, and afterwards, when she is visiting 
Altenburg and falls into danger, rescues her at 
some pergonal peril. This also is a harmless and 
mildly entertaining story. 

The sort of historical romance that has for 
its hero a long-suffering soldier of fortune, and 
that disports itself by preference in six- 
teenth-century France, is well illustrated by the 
'Orrain' of Mr. S. Levett- Yeats. The story con- 
cerns the rivalry of Diane de Poitiers and the 
Queen, and the strife between Huguenots and 
Catholics. A Huguenot maiden is the heroine, 
and her love is the romantic prize of the narra- 
tive ; whUe her riches, coveted by Diane, lead her 
into desperate dangers. It is needless to say that 
Orrain is always there for her rescue in the nick 
of time. It is a little curious to find Catharine 
de Medicis saving a Huguenot victim from the 
clutches of the church, but the Queen at this 
time was a different person from the Queen 
Mother of the year of the Massacre. Mr. Levett- 
Yeats has a pretty trick of style and description^ 
and knows how to construct an ingenious plot. 

Mr. Max Pemberton's new novel, 'Beatrice of 
Venice,' has a subject of exceptional interest^ 
and turns out to be a work of more 'body' than 
most of the author's previous inventions. It is a 
historical romance, dealing with the early stages 
of Napoleon's Italian campaign, and culminating 
with the horrors of the ' vespers of Verona, ' after 
which the occupation of Venice becomes a matter 
of course. The action is about evenly divided 
between Venice and Verona, and for the neces- 
sary pair of lovers we have on the one hand a 
trusted aide of Napoleon, and on the other a 
great lady of Venice. The latter is enabled, at 
the risk of steps and positions that are danger- 
ously compromising, to soften the fate of the 
captured city, and thus vindicate the patriotism 
which has been questioned by many suspicious 
persons. The story abounds in dramatic action, 
and is altogether a very creditable example of 
the sort of romance which it exemplifies. 

Mr. John Oxenham's 'Hearts in Eaile' tells 
the old melodramatic story of Russian tyranny, 
secret police, Siberian exile, and eventual escape,

but connects it with a plot of distinct novelty. 
Two men love the same woman, and she makes 
her choice. Afterwards both are exiled, her hus- 
band to the more remote and difficult region. 
The two meet on the journey to Siberia, and 
change names and destinations, thus giving the 
husband the better chance of escape. The wife, 
meanwhile, starts for Siberia to join her hus- 
band, and having reached her distant goal finds 
her rejected lover instead. The situation is diffi- 
cult, for she must pass for his wife, lest the 
exchange of names be discovered and both men 
put in jeopardy. Long afterwards, news comes 
of the death of her husband, and in due course of 
time she marries the other man, whom she has 
always secretly loved. But of course the hus- 
band is not dead, and of course he reappears 
when the mischief is done. So there is nothing 
for it but to dispose of him for good, after the 
agony has been sufficiently developed; and this is 
done by having him shot when all three are 
escaping together. The author tells his story 
simply and directly, with much poignant force. 
As he himself says, the narrative 'deals with 
human emotions rather than with a too realistic 
detail of all the facts which excited them.' All 
of which means that the story is better than 
most of its class, although not to be compared 
with such powerful work as Mrs. Voynich's 
'Olive Latham,' which it in some respects resem- 
bles. 

Mr. H. G. Wells has added another to the 
lengthening series of his ingenious fantasies of 
mingled romance and scientific forecast. He 
calls it 'The Food of the Gods,' and bases it 
upon the chemical preparation of a food-product 
that produces gigantic growth in every organism 
to which it is administered. When this product 
finds its way out of the laboratories of the invent- 
ors, startling consequences are entailed. To 
begin with, it produces gigantic chickens and 
rats and wasps, to say nothing of dangerous 
rank growths of vegetation. But its real mission 
is to produce a gigantic race of men and women ; 
and when a certain number of these creatures 
have been raised upon it, and grown to their 
mature stature of forty feet or thereabouts, 
civilization has to face a serious menace. These 
creatures are Uebermenxchen in a more literal 
sense than that of which Nietzsche dreamed ; and 
as soon as they become conscious of their power, 
they have things pretty much their own way. 
The Food (properly call Boomfood) once started 
on its revolutionizing mission, all attempts to 
suppress it prove futile, and in the end there 
seems to be no outlook but extermination for 
ordinary old-fashioned mortals. It is a big con- 
ception, developed with much ingenuity of detail; 
yet, with all his imagination, the author has only 
touched upon its possibilities here and there. 
There is not a little humor of the dry, satirical 
kind in the book, and here the author is at his 
best; when he seeks to be magniloquent he 
achieves only bathos. 

One of the most important novels of the sea- 
son, and one of the strongest works of fiction 
that we have read for many a day, is Mr. 



Laurence Housman's ' Sabrina Warham.' Mr. 
Housman takes his art very seriously, and most 
zealously avoids every species of claptrap and 
sensationalism. His style is both strong and 
finished, following approved conventional models 
rather than seeking to produce striking effects. 
The high seriousness of this work makes it almost 
sombre in coloring, for it is with the tragic 
deeps of life that the author chooses to deal, 
and he resorts sparingly to such elaborations of 
surface-detail as occupy the chief attention of 
nine out of ten contemporary novelists. Of his 
half-dozen or more leading characters, every one 
has the strength of distinct individuality. It 
may be the strength to maintain the citadel of 
one's ideals against insurgent temptations, as in 
the case of Sabrina; it may be the strength to 
endure greatly with no outward manifestation of 
emotion, as in the case of David, whom Sabrina 
eventually marries. Again, it may be the 
strength of a character narrowly opinionated, as 
in the case of Sabrina 's mother; it may be the 
strength of a perverted and sour nature, as in 
the case of David's father; or it may be the 
strength of persistence in justifying an immoral 
course of conduct, as in the case of the man 
whom Sabrina first marries and afterwards 
rejects when she discovers how he has deceived 
her. It is possibly chargeable to Mr, Housman 
as a fault, that each of these characters is too 
unmitigated in its exemplification of a particular 
theory of life,— that all depart to some extent, 
in their rigidity of delineation, from the figures 
that actual life has to offer. We are not sure 
that this criticism is justifiable; what we are 
sure of is that the figures in this book have so 
deep an impress of vital truth that they make 
shadows or puppets out of the figures in most 
other novels of the hour. In reading * Sabrina 
Warham,' we have been reminded more of Mr. 
Hardy than of any other novelist; but it is 
hardly fair even to make a suggestion of this 
sort, so entirely is the work Mr. Housman's own. 
By way of contrast, let us set beside the work 
just reviewed, the ' Double Harness ' of Mr. 
Anthony Hope Hawkins. This is a very skilful 
piece of workmanship indeed, the product of a 
highly accomplished craftsman in letters; yet it 
cannot compare for a moment with the other in 
strength. It is not that it opposes the muse of 
romantic comedy to the muse of tragedy, for 
the one may inspire as profoundly as the other; 
but it is rather that it has a movement too obvi- 
ously mechanical, a plan too obviously artifi- 
cial, to prove convincing. Here we have deline- 
ated with admirable cleverness the lives of three 
married couples, each of them starting out, no 
doubt, with the best of intentions, yet each in its 
own special way making a mess of the matrimo- 
nial experiment. The three are ingeniously 
differentiated, so that each makes an effective 
foil for the others, and all are brought into a 
network of inter-relations that gives a certain 
unity to the work as a whole. Moreover, Mr. 
Hope's gift for phrase-making lends sparkle and 
animation to his every page But his characters 
leave no mark: they are not real in any natural

sense; if they are real in the sophisticated sense 
of modern English society, they prove that 
society rotten to the core, and thus unprofitable 
even for reproof. The author forgives his char- 
acters for their various sins— 'Pardon's the word 
for all, ' — and would have his readers forgive 
them also, which is Christian and commendable. 
We do not think he expects us to admire them, 
save in one instance, and that is the instance of 
a man who, when his wife is about to desert her 
husband and child, forces her return by the 
threat ( which we are given to understand is 
made in deadly earnest ) that if she leaves him 
he will forthwith kill both himself and their 
infant child. This is a trifle too strong even for 
melodrama, and we can hardly hold such a char- 
acter at his creator's estimate.

NOTES ON NEW NOVELS. 

Apart from having his lovers practical Chris- 
tians in the time of Augustus several years B. C, 
there is little in Mr. Irving Bacheller's 'Vergilius, 
a Tale of the Coming of Christ' (Harper) with 
which the most fastidious critic can find fault. He 
presents a vivid and convincing panorama of 
imperial Eome and Herodian Jerusalem, and through 
the political intrigues of both capitals his pair of 
Eoman patricians, youthful soldier and beautiful 
maiden, thread a sure path to happiness. Plots 
and counter-plots, gladiatorial combats and excit- 
ing personal encounters, banqueting and voyaging, 
fill the pages and lead up to the fine scene of the 
first Christmas. 

'Deacon Lysander' (Baker & Taylor Co.), Mrs, 
Sarah Pratt McLean Greene's latest book, is the 
story of an old-fashioned countryman of sufficient 
means, who takes his wife Candace with him on 
a visit to the national capital and has there a 
series of humanizing experiences. The happy 
and contented couple are housed by chance in a 
shabby-genteel school for girls with a boarding- 
house attachment. The secrets of the household 
are sufficiently obvious, with all the petty shifts 
to maintain appearances on the part of the three 
maiden sisters at its head. One of the three pupils 
is kept from making a silly match by the good 
Deacon, and eventually the three school-mistresses 
are drafted off to a more comfortable career in the 
pleasant little town in which the good man lives. 

Kentucky, with its feuds, negroes, and whiskey, is 
the scene of Mr. Opie Eead's 'Turk' (Laird & Lee). 
The story begins in the period just before the war, 
while the agitation for the abolition of slavery is 
going on, passing through that monumental strug- 
gle briefly, and bringing up somewhat abruptly 
with the hero in ownership of a fortune, all in 
gold coin, bequeathed him by a miser. The hero is 
a bound boy, the sole survivor of family welfare, 
and a well-drawn if somewhat unpleasant character. 
No small share of the narrative is given over to a 
discussion of the liquor evil, which includes a vivid 
delineation of the temptations suffered by one who 
has inherited a tendency to drink not wisely but 
too well. The book has more reserve and a better 
conception of plot than most of Mr. Eead's books, 
and affords a convincing picture of the times. 

Mr. Wilson Barrett's 'Never-Never Land' (Lip- 
pincott) is likely to make the reader *sit up' — 



to borrow one of its favorite phrases. It is a 
thorough-going old-fashioned Adelphi melodrama 
in book form, with incident enough for a whole 
'nickel library' between its two covers. It opens 
in the back country of Australia, with a bank 
robbery, a bush fire, a fatal accident, and a gang 
of villains using a dialect fearful and wonderful; 
it traverses the United States, where people speak 
the variety of English usually put into the mouths 
of American characters on the British stage; and 
it ends in merry England. 

'A Kittiwake of the Great Kills' (The Grafton 
Press) is the collective title of twelve tales of 
living things, including birds, beasts, snails, crabs, 
and a tortoise, by Mr. Charles Frederick Stansbury. 
They are all placid, interesting, and sympathetic, 
written from the point of view of an elder and 
wiser brother, and well calculated, if read, to put an 
end to the lack of consideration with which so many 
created things are viewed by thoughtless human 
beings. Especially to be commended is the reserve 
with which the deeds of smaller beings are set 
forth, avoiding over-drafts on one's credulity in 
dealing with animal psychology. 

Materials of the slightest furnish forth the con- 
tents of Mr. John Harwood Bacon's 'The Pursuit 
of Phyllis' (Holt). An American novelist of means, 
sent off on vacation to recuperate from overwork, 
chances upon letters addressed to a young woman 
he has never heard of; he undertakes the fantastic 
duty of delivering them to her, goes to Paris, 
Marseilles, Ceylon, Hong Kong, and various other 
remote regions, in pursuit of her, — and what was 
expected to happen duly comes to pass. 

A rather flippant story of a fortune and its 
successive possessors, by Mr. James Branch Cabell, 
is called 'The Eagle's Shadow' (Doubleday, Page 
& Co.), the eagle having reference to good Ameri- 
can money. A millionaire father dies and leaves all 
his wealth to his niece, with whom the son is in 
love. There is a general mix-up on account of two 
conflicting wills that are discovered, but all the 
differences between the lovers disappear after some 
misunderstanding, and all is well with the world at 
the close of the book. 

'More Cheerful Americans' (Holt) is the name 
of Mr. Charles Battell Loomis's volume of eighteen 
humorous tales, done in his familiar manner. They 
have little purpose except to amuse, although a 
couple of them verge upon the domain of crit- 
icism: ' The Song That Sold ' as showing what kind 
of music Americans can be persuaded to think they 
like, and 'How to Write a Novel for the Masses' — 
the latter so nearly true that one wonders why Mr. 
Loomis does not follow his own prescription and 
amass wealth thereby. 

The manner in which millionaires from the new 
world can be taken in by unscrupulous venders of 
articles of vertu in the old gives Miss Alice Jones 
the central idea about which 'Gabriel Praed's 
Castle' (Herbert B. Turner & Co.) is constructed. 
As an American painter and an American designer 
of costumes also become involved in the plot, the 
story has elements of excitement akin to those 
of a good detective story, with two pretty love- 
stories thrown in. 

Heading every chapter with a strain of music 
as well as a musical title. Miss Linnie S. Harris 
makes the heroine of 'Sweet Peggy' (Little, Brown 
& Co.) the possessor of a beautiful voice, and the 
hero a singer likewise. The scene is in the New 
England hills; the story is idyllic; and the minor 
characters are such as really exist in those regions.

Oregon, from A terse sketch of the history of 
wilderness a most interesting portion of our 

to statehood. Pacific Coast territory is fur- 
nished in Sidona V. Johnson's ' Short History 
of Oregon' (McClurg & Co). This rapid narra- 
tive touches briefly upon all the importaat epi- 
sodes (which are not few) in the historical life 
of the region once known as 'the Oregon coun- 
try,' and which now embraces the states of Ore- 
gon, Washington, and Idaho, with portions of 
adjacent states. Beginning with the sub-title of 
'Discovery,' the voyages of European sailors 
along the shores of the Pacific axe recounted, 
ending with the discovery by Captain Gray of 
the estuary of the Columbia River in 1792, and 
his entrance upon its broad waters, and the sub- 
sequent acquaintance of the British seamen with 
this discovery, and their occupation of the shores 
of the Columbia under the claim of priority. 
Wisely refraining from re-arguing a question 
now admitted to be settled in favor of the United 
States, the compiler cites the facts as to our 
prior occupation of the valley of the river, and 
the strained construction of the facts under 
which Great Britain affected to dispute our claim, 
which was long since admitted. The exploration 
of the territory is illustrated by a summary of 
the leading features of the well-known Lewis 
and Clark expedition; following which, nearly 
half of the text is devoted to a more detailed 
history of the settlement of the Oregon country. 
The romantic story of the contest between two 
great Anglo-Saxon civilizations for the control 
of our empire on the Pacific is here related in a 
succinct and readable form. The labors and 
schemes of rival fur-trading companies, the com- 
peting plans for immigration and settlement, the 
quiet but often successful workings of the great 
companies in opposition to the introduction of 
immigrants for permanent occupation, the com- 
plications caused by the advent of missionaries 
of diverse creeds and their frequent clashes of 
opinion and influence, and the varying effects 
of these conflicting agencies upon the feeling and 
disposition of the native tribes, are here set forth 
as among the factors of a great international 
controversy; though to each of these episodes, 
as to the narrative of the labors and exp>eriences 
of Dr. Marcus Whitman, ending in the lament- 
able 'Whitman massacre,' but little space can 
be allowed in this 'short history.' The work is 
a convenient compendium of the leading events 
in the period sketched, closing with an account 
of the final ending of 'the Oregon question,' and 
the institution in the disputed country, first of 
territorial and afterward of state government 
according to the American model. From wilder- 
ness to metropolitan statehood was such a rapid 
course in this instance as to warrant its being 
recounted as history in these 315 pages. 

We are gi'owing accustomed to 
the plaint that the essay is 
dead, its place usurped by a 
new literary genre, the article of information

for a public that is tired of fine-spun theories and 
demands facts— when it is not occupied with fic- 
tion. We may be inclined to dispute the place 
of the practical man and his article in literature, 
but we are hardly in a position to deny the 
decadence,— or, to speak more accurately, the 
gradual disappearance,— of the essay. In Amer- 
ica at least it would be in a bad way, were it 
not for a little band of choice spirits few enough 
to be counted on one's fingers, and numbering 
among their late recruits Dr. Samuel Crothers, 
and among their leaders tried and true Miss 
Agnes Repplier. It is almost superfluous to 
attempt a review of Miss Repplier 's latest volume 
of essays, published under the title of 'Com- 
promises' (Houghton). Most of these essays are 
already familiar to magazine readers; and even 
if that were not the case, she has long since found 
her public, who need no critical t-anction to 
assure them that amid the snares and delusions 
of the book-mart Miss Repplier is of the few 
who may always be depended upon. The new 
'Compromises' are as clever and as delight- 
fully heretical as the older 'Points of View.' 
There is the same felicity of bookish allusion, 
the same keen-edged analysis, and the unfailing 
wit whereby Miss Repplier has done so much to 
enhance 'The Gayety of Life,' to quote the title 
of one of these essays, and the luxury of litera- 
ture, to paraphrase another. As usual, she 
sweeps through a wide range of subjects. 'Mar- 
riage in Fiction,' 'Our Belief in Books,' and 
'The Luxury of Conversation' are perhaps most 
characteristic. Another group of essays, includ- 
ing 'The Tourist,' 'The Headsman,' 'The Beg- 
gar's Pouch,' and 'The Pilgrim's Staff,' hint of 
recent European travel, some of them being the 
outgrowth of personal experience, and others 
clever bits of research along forgotten byways 
of history. There are plenty of people who do 
not care for Miss Repplier,— who find her hard as 
well as brilliant, too allusive, too personal in her 
attitude to life, too critical of its commonplace 
dogmas. They generally end by saying that Miss 
Repplier is a woman, and— for reasons that vary 
with each disputant— women cannot write essays. 
Only time can settle the large issue, and 'Com- 
promises' will not alter the party lines much. 
In 'Points of View,' Miss Repplier reached her 
high-water mark, though one detects a slight gain 
in simplicity and mellowness in the more recent 

volumes. 

The real subject of the hand- 
book entitled 'The Apprecia- 
tion of Sculpture,' from the 
pen of that accomplished critic Mr. Russell Stur- 
gis and published by the Baker & Taylor Co., 
is sculpture for sculpture's sake. This is sound 
doctrine. In full acceptance of its point of view, 
and all that is implied by it, lies the true criterion 
for those who would learn to know and appre- 
ciate. A work of art should be valued for itself 
rather than for any moral lesson it may inculcate, 
or for the appeal, however subtle or impressive, 
that it may make to sentiment. The more pointed 
the lesson and the stronger the appeal, the more 
does it tend to divert attention from the artistic

[Nov. 16, 



qualities of the work. To sculpture, because of 
its nature and limitations, this applies with 
especial force. If the sculptor be in truth an 
artist, his main thought and purpose must of 
necessity be aesthetic. Should enthusiasm for 
any associated idea sway him too far, his pro- 
ductions are sure to suffer by the substitution of 
thoughts foreign to his art as such. . Historic, 
religious, mythological, or literary :3ignificances 
are all very well, and interest in them is not to be 
deprecated; but they ai'e things quite distinct 
and apart from the artistic quality which is of 
first importance in works of art. By scattering 
such considerations through his book, instead of 
setting them forth at the outset, Mr. Sturgis 
avoids the semblance of preaching and aims to 
lead up to the right mental attitude rather than 
to formulate it. Yet somewhow, in spite of the 
truth of what he says, the manner of putting it 
is, on the whole, inconclusive. He begins by 
enumerating the existing works of sculpture that 
unquestionably are of the best epoch of Greek 
art, or have the characteristics of that epoch, 
and which constitute our best standard of excel- 
lence. The inquiry then proceeds, taking up the 
Greco-Roman works, those of Europe in the Mid- 
dle Ages, the Italian Revival and Decadence, and 
ending with several chapters on the sculpture of 
our own day. Eighty excellent and well-chosen 
illustrations serve to point the author's remarks, 
Avhich are always intelligent and discriminating. 



Astronomy of the 
sentimental sort. 



Camille Flammarion has a 
very considerable reputation 
as a writer on popular astron- 
omy. He understands the audience for which he 
writes, and his works have a large sale in France. 
But when his latest book is placed before the 
American public imder the title of 'Astronomy 
for Amateurs' (Appleton), there is cause for 
pi'otest; for the title of the French volume of 
which this is the authorized translation is 
'Astronomy for Women,' and the contents amply 
justify the title. Indeed, had the American title 
been 'Astronomy for French Women,' it would 
have described the book more accurately. There 
are, however, at least two passages in the first 
hundred pages which a French or American 
mother of average discreetness would hesitate to 
read to her family of growing girls and boys. 
Such passages might be expected in the pages of 
a French novel, but there is no good excuse for 
inserting them in a book on astronomy. The gen- 
eral style of the book may be indicated by say- 
ing that the text is sentimental, fanciful, rhe- 
torically exuberant, at times inexact, and always 
readable by people who enjoy reading of that 
sort. The inexactness is sometimes due to the 
author's endeavor to adapt his knowledge to the 
average feminine intellect, as he estimates it. 
Educated American women will resent the esti- 
mate. Most of the errors, however, were evi- 
dently 'made in America.' For example, the 
statement that the two moons of Mars were dis- 
covered by 'Mr. Hall at the University of Wash- 
ington,' can scarcely have been made by a man 
so well posted as Flammarion; his well-known 



antipathy to the French National Observatory 
would hardly lead him to refuse to credit this 
capital discovery to the U. S. Naval Observatory. 
As an illustration of the depths of sentimental- 
ism with which the author essays to charm the 
reader betimes, we quote from p. 192, premising 
that 'Fig. 54' is a wood-cut which occupies nearly 
a page and represents a young girl looking at a 
stooting star. 'The young girl dreaming in the 
delicious tranquility of the transparent night 
smiles at this charming sister in the Heavens 
(Fig. 54). What cannot this adorable star 
announce to the tender and loving heart? Is it 
the shy messenger of the happiness so long 
desired? Its unpremeditated appearance fills the 
soul with a ray of hope and makes it tremble. 
It is a golden beam that glides into the heart, 
expanding it in the thrills of a sudden and 
ephemeral pleasure.' For a combination of irre- 
fragable logic and unimpeachable English, behold 
the following quotation from page 208. The 
author is endeavoring to show how the earth is 
supported in space, without falling. ' A body can 
only fall when it is attracted, drawn by a more 
important body. Now in whatever direction we 
may wander upon the globe, our feet are always 
downward. Down is therefore the center of the 
Earth, The terrestrial globe may be regarded 
as an immense ball of magnet, and its attraction 
holds us at its surface. We weigh toward the 
center. . . This once understood, where could 
the Earth fall to? The question is an absurdity. 
"Below" being toward the center, it would have 
to fall out of itself.' But why quote further? 
The whole matter may be summed up by saying 
that the reader of this book is by turns enlight- 
ened, misled, bewildered, and amused. 



Familiar talks 
on country topics. 



Mr, William Potts, writing 
apparently as a resident, or 
summer resident, of Farming- 
ton, Connecticut, loyally maintains that this 
pleasant and somewhat historic town has held in 
its day a place next only to Rome and Boston as 
a world centre; and in that town the particular 
spot of chief interest and importance, to him at 
least, is very naturally his attractive home, which 
he has christened ' Underledge. ' In 'More Notes 
from Underledge' (Dodd), he chats genially 
with his readers, sometimes as a botanist or a 
meteorologist, sometimes as an antiquary, and 
again on whatever subject pops into his head, 
be it 'the passing of the pvunp' or the hideous 
monstrosity of the so-called 'trolley.' The prime 
virtue of his little book is its frank and natural 
tone, which reveals the writer in his words and 
shows him to be a thoroughly companionable, 
communicative sort of person, with a merry mood 
that is not above quips and jests of even a very 
trivial kind. The style is indeed the man in his 
case, unless the reader is greatly deceived. From 
his chapter on 'Lamb's Tales,' which has noth- 
ing to do with its title, and but very little with 
sheep-raising, its ostensible theme, let us take, 
almost at random, a characteristic passage: 'A 
marsh is always an interesting place, especially 
to an artist, and also to one who is fond of wild-

flowers, for here he will find them in the great- 
est profusion and variety. And then what pos- 
sibilities of snakes are here, not to speak of musk- 
rats and other wild fowl!' Again, speaking of 
his cellar drainage, he says: *It was a happy 
accident that the builder had been brought up in 
the school of that modern Greek who, what time 
there happened an unfortunate giving way in the 
"bow of his boot, wisely made an equivalent aper- 
ture in the stern, so that the water which * * ran in 
at the toe ran immejetly out at the heel. ' ' ' Chit- 
chat is not the highest form of literature, but 
who shall say it has not its uses? 



Memoirs of 
leaders of the 
French Revolution 



There is a suggestion of invid- 
ious comparisons about the 
title 'The Great Frenchman 
and the Little Genevese' (Putnam), which Lady 
Seymour has chosen for her translation of 
Etienne Dumont's 'Souvenirs sur Mirabeau.' 
Judged by the impression which his memoirs have 
left upon students of the Revolutionary period, 
and by the estimates of his character held by 
such men as Sir Samuel Romilly, Dumont was the 
opposite of 'little. ' He had not only an unusually 
clear and s3Tnpathetic mind,— he writes of his 
recollections with surprising candor. Many of 
the memoirs of the Revolution were composed 
during the Napoleonic period, or during the 
Restoration; but what writer confesses, like 
Dumont in 1799, 'during the last ten years I 
have already forgotten many facts, and I fear 
that if I wait much longer my memory of them 
will become very confused,' and 'as to the second 
part [the period after Mirabeau's death] I have 
still less to record, my recollections are very scat- 
tered and the sequence of them is often broken.' 
In this Avay he disclaims that restrospective omni- 
science which frequently misleads the reader of 
memoirs. His candor gives a pleasant conversa- 
tional tone to his recollections; one feels that 
with so sane a guide one may see events and men 
as they would actually appear were we to step 
down into the streets of Revolutionary Paris. 
Dumont 's work concerns Mirabeau chiefly, but 
his descriptions of Talleyrand, of Brissot, Cla- 
viere, and of Madame Roland, are almost equally 
interesting. 'With them all he was on confidential 
terms. Lady Seymour's translation is spirited, 
though not free from minor inaccuracies, includ- 
ing a mistake in the original title of the book. 
She is also in error when she says that hers is the 
first English translation of the 'Souvenirs,' for 
an English translation was published in 1832, 
Her work is none the less a service, because the 
earlier translation has long been practically 
unprocurable. 

Apropos of the beatitude with 
which Mr. Bradford Torrey 
begins his delightful essay on 
Hazlitt, 'Blessed is the man who enjoys himself,' 
it is pertinent to respond, ' Blessed too is the man 
who enjoys the world around him.' And Mr. 
Bradford Torrey himself, if indeed not the man, 
is at least one of the chief of such men. It is a 
great deal to say that his new book, 'Nature's 
Invitation' (Houghton), which, like its predeces- 



The invitations 
of Nature. 



sors, is a reprint from magazines and newspapers, 
is as good as his other writings. In truth, it is a 
little better,— a little more perfect in its amalga- 
mation of life, literature, and nature, a little 
richer in its experience of birds and blossoms, 
men and mountains. It is wider, too, in geo- 
graphical range, recording visits to Mt. Wash- 
ington, the Everglades of Florida, and the deserts 
of New Mexico; but to 'the man with birds in 
his eye'— and other beautiful things,— location 
is a mere incident. ' The student of nature, ' Mr. 
Torrey says, 'is never at a loss what to do with 
his day'; and never at a loss, moreover, to make 
the best of any situation in which he may be 
placed. A bleak trip up Moosilauke in May is 
cheered for him by the discovery of Selkirkii, 
'the one species of our Eastern North American 
violets he has never picked'; the inanity of a 
Florida winter hotel is replaced by the excitement 
of identifying rare trees and shrubs in the ham- 
mock land near by; even the tedium of a nine 
hours' delay on the railroad is turned into an 
opportunity, for since 'the tourist's mind, like his 
stomach, abhors a vacuum,' he goes bird-hunting 
and has six new species to show for it. 'Blessed 
are they who want something, for when they get 
it they will be glad, ' Especially blessed are they 
who want the beauties of the out-door world, and 
have gladness like Mr, Torrey 's when they find 
them. All such will subscribe heartily to the 
naturalist's creed, which is thus simply stated: 
' Man was not made to see one kind of beauty, or 
to believe in one kind of goodness. The whole 
world is hid in his heart. All things are his. 
The small and the great, the near and the far, 
light and darkness, good and evil, the intimacies 
of home and the isolations of infinite space, all 
are parts of the Creator's worls;, and equally parts 
of the creature's inheritance,' 



A proffered Ii Dr. Washington Gladden 's 

substitute for latest book, 'Where Does the 

creeds out-worn. Sky Begin?' (Houghton, Mifflin 
& Co.), there is gathered some of the ripest fruit 
of two or three years' thinking and preaching. 
Dr. Gladden 's congregation in Columbus are for- 
tunate in having been the first to hear the nine- 
teen discourses which compose this volume; but 
aside from the sonorous delivery vhich com- 
mended them so favorably to the ear, there is 
enough meat and marrow in them, enough sanc- 
tified common-sense, to meet the tastes and the 
needs of the larger constituency throughout the 
country who have often been helped to clear 
thinking by the utterances of this vigorous 
preacher of righteousness. The practical prob- 
lems of the mind, and the Christian life as it can 
be lived even in this day and generation, are here 
discussed with unfailing freshness, only a sug- 
gestion of which may here be given by repeating 
some of the most striking titles, 'Moments and 
Movements,' 'The Fulfillment of Life,' 'Knowing 
How to be Rich,' 'The Everlasting Yea,' 'The 
Education of Our Wants,' 'How to be Sure of 
God,' 'The Lesson of the Cross,' are captions 
Avhich will appeal not in vain to a wide range 
of thoughtful readers. Not much of the 'old

theology' is to be found in these pages, even as an 
object of denunciation; the polemics of other 
days have been succeeded by the glow and enthu- 
siasm of a constructive Christianity that feels 
the obligation resting upon it to replace the out- 
Avorn creeds by a living and working faith. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The new 'Gladstone' edition of Eossetti gives us 
in a single volume the complete poetical works, 
with full index and other editorial equipment. It 
follows the text of Mr. W. M. Eossetti 's authorized 
edition, and has the introduction written by him 
nearly twenty years ago. It is published by Messrs. 
T. Y. Crowell & Co. 

"With the publication of Volume IV. of 'The 
Spanish Conquest in America,' by Sir Arthur 
Helps, Mr. John Lane has completed his handsome 
reprint of this important work. His share of the 
undertaking as publisher leaves nothing to be 
desired, and ■ the editorial part of the work, as 
performed by Mr. M. Oppenheim, is also highly 
satisfactory. 

Messrs, Lewis Emerson Horning and Lawrence 
J. Burpee have collaborated in the preparation of 
'A Bibliography of Canadian Fiction' in English, 
which comes to us from Mr. William Briggs, 
Toronto, as a pamphlet publication of the Victoria 
University Library. This is a companion to the 
similar account of Canadian poetry which was 
published five years ago. 

Messrs. A. S. Barnes & Co. publish 'In the Days 
of Chaucer,' by Mr. Tudor Jenks, with an introduc- 
tion by Mr. H. W. Mabie. This is the first book 
of a series planned by Mr. Jenks for the purpose 
of vivifying the lives and times of the great Eng- 
lish writers. The book is incidentally a biography, 
but essentially a picture of life in an age long 
past, and now described for us in simple and 
attractive language. 

'The Art of Caricature' (Baker & Taylor Co.), 
by Mr. Grant White, is a text-book intended to 
provide its readers with a foundation upon which 
to build an art education. The information given 
has not, for the most part, appeared in printed 
form elsewhere, and the author has of course kept 
the needs of the beginner constantly in mind. As 
a book of instruction, it supplies technical knowl- 
edge that will appeal to the embryo artist, and the 
illustrations accompanying the chapters on expres- 
sion, color, technique, composition, etc., are of such 
a nature as to furnish a fundamental idea of the 
general requirements of the art in question. 

The 'Oxford Modern French Series,' edited by 
Mr. Leon Delbos, is a collection of texts, provided 
with introductions and notes, and published by 
Mr. Henry Frowde for the Oxford Clarendon Press. 
The following eight volumes are now at hand: 
Lamartine's 'Deux Heroines de la Eevolution 
Frangaise,' edited by Miss Mary Bentinek-Smith; 
Balzac's 'La Vendetta' and 'Pierre Grassou,' 
edited by Miss Marie Pechinet; Hugo's 'Bug- 
Jargal,' edited by Mr. Louis Sers; Sandeau's 
'Mademoiselle de la Seiglere' (the novel), edited 
by Mr. A. L. Dupuis; a selection from Chateau- 
briand's 'M6moires d 'Outre-Tombe, ' edited by Mr. 
Louis Sers; Karr's 'Voyage autour de mon Jardin,' 
edited by Mr. Stuart G. Hallam; Gozlan's 'Le 
Chateau de Vaux, edited by Mr. A. H. Smith; and 
'Extraits des Voyages d 'Alexis de Tocqueville, ' 
edited by Mr. J. Mansion. Some of the texts are 
'slightly shortened,' a matter for much regret. 



Notes. 



A volume of 'Synopses of Dickens's Novels,' pre- 
pared by Mr. J. Walker McSpadden, is a useful 
little book published by Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & 
Co. 

A collection of eight hundred letters written by 
William and Dorothy Wordsworth, their brother 
John, and other members of the family, has been 
prepared by Prof. William Knight and will be 
published this month by Messrs. Ginn & Co. 

Professor Dana Carleton Munro has prepared for 
the use of teachers in secondary schools 'A Source 
Book of Eoman History,' which should prove a 
valuable adjunct to the work of instruction. 
Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. are the publishers. 

Mr. Jonathan Nield's 'Guide to the Best His- 
torical Novels and Tales' is published by the 
Messrs. Putnam in a third edition, revised and 
enlarged. This is a very useful book, and in its 
present form is far more valuable than it was 
before. 

Still another jiu-jitsu book comes to us from Mr. 
H. Irving Hancock, who has already done so much 
to familiarize us with Japanese methods of physical 
training. 'Jiu-Jitsu Combat Tricks' is the title of 
this volume, which is published by the Messrs. 
Putnam. 

Mr. Ernest Pertwee follows up his recent 'Ee- 
citer's Treasury of Verse' with a companion volume 
of nearly a thousand pages devoted to Prose and 
the Drama. All degrees of literary merit are repre- 
sented in the collection, but it seems on the whole 
well calculated to serve its special purpose. 

Mr. Thomas Bailey Aldrich's play entitled 
'Judith of Bethulia, ' written for Miss Nance 
O'Neill and lately produced by her in Boston, 
will be published at an early date by Messrs. 
Houghton, Mifflin & Co. It is in part a dramatiza- 
tion of Mr. Aldrich's narrative poem, 'Judith and 
Holof ernes. ' 

'The American Jewish Year Book' for 5665 
(which is the year beginning this last September), 
is sent us by the Jewish Publication Society of 
America. It is edited by Dr. Cyrus Adler and Miss 
Henrietta Szold, is prevailingly biographical in 
character, and might be called a Jewish ' Who 's Who 
in America.' 

Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. have nearly ready Prof. 
Kellogg 's long-delayed book on 'American Insects.' 
It will contain over eight hundred illustrations in 
color and black-and-white, and will cover in a com- 
prehensive way the entire American insect world. 
The same publishers have nearly ready a volume 
entitled 'Pedagogues and Parents,' by Mrs. Ella 
Calista Wilson. 

A biography of the late Henry D. Lloyd, the 
well-known writer and speaker on economic and 
industrial subjects, is to be prepared by his sister, 
Mrs. Caro Lloyd Witherington, of New York. Any 
personal letters or reminiscences of Mr, Lloyd, or 
any material desirable for the purpose, will be 
thankfully received by Mrs. Witherington, at 49 
Wall Street, New York, in care of Mr, Henry W. 
Goodrich. 

One of the most interesting biographies of the 
year may confidently be expected in Mr. James 
Douglas's Life of Theodore Watts-Dunton, poet, 
novelist, and critic, announced for early publica- 
tion by Mr. John Lane. During his long life Mr. 
W^atts-Dunton has been intimately associated with 
most of the great figures in Victorian literature and 
art. Eeminiscences, anecdotes, and letters of these 
distinguished friends will occupy a large place In

the forthcoming volume, which will also include 
some hitherto unpublished poems by Mr. Watts- 
Dunton and extracts from his articles contributed 
to the London 'Athenaeum.' 

Baedeker's 'Italy from the Alps to Naples,' 
recently imported by the Messrs. Scribner, is a 
new book compiled from the three more extended 
volumes devoted to Italy, and contains all the 
matter that the hurried traveller, and most of the 
matter that the leisurely traveller, will need for 
his guidance. 

Messrs. Thomas Y. Crowell & Co. reprint, in 
their 'Luxenbourg' edition of favorite standard 
novels, the following works: Jane Austen's 
'Pride and Prejudice,' William Ware's 'Zenobia,' 
Lever's 'Harry Lorrequer,' Bulwer's 'Eienzi,' and 
LeSage's 'Gil Bias.' Each volume is handsomely 
illustrated and neatly boxed. 

The next title in Mr. Francis P. Harper's 
important Americana reprints, now nearly ready, 
will be 'The Life and Writings of Father Pierre- 
Jean De Smet,' edited by Major Hiram M. Chit- 
tenden and Mr. Alfred Talbot Eichardson. The 
edition is in four large volumes, with full his- 
torical, geographical, ethnological, and other notes, 
a new biography of Father De Smet, and numerous 
illustrations. 

Three books of much interest in connection with 
the great conflict in the far East are announced 
for publication during the present month. Two 
of these are by Japanese writers, — Dr. K. Asa- 
kawa's 'The Eusso-Japanese Conflict: Its Causes 
and Issues' (Houghton), and Mr. Okakura-Kakuzo 's 
'The Awakening of Japan' (Century Co.). The 
third volume is Dr. Hugo Ganz's account of Eussia 
of to-day, entitled 'The Land of Eiddles' (Harper). 

The newest issues in the series of 'Handy 
Volume Classics,' published by the Messrs. Crowell, 
are as follows: Sheridan's 'The Eivals, ' and 
'The School for Scandal,' edited by Professor 
Brander Matthews; 'Songs from the Dramatists,' 
edited by Eobert Bell, with an introduction to 
the new edition by Professor Matthews; a selection 
of Addison's essays, with an introduction by Mr. 
H. W. Mabie; 'The Hundred Best English Poems,' 
selected by Mr. Adam L. Gowans; and a selection 
from Chesterfield's letters, edited by Mr. Charles 
Welsh.

TENTH SEASON OF THE CALIFORNIA 
LIMITED. 

Ten years ago this fall the Santa Fe started its 
California Limited train on the initial run across the 
continent. Many improvements have been made in that 
busy decade. To-day's engines and coaches are much 
heavier than those of 1894. Millions of dollars have 
been spent on the track alone — some of it for oil- 
sprinkled (dustless) roadbed and oil-burning (smoke- 
less) engines. The time is faster, too. 

Daily service of the California Limited was resumed 
Sunday, November 13, for the tenth season. This is 
now an all-the-year- 'round train, between Chicago, Los 
Angeles and San Francisco, running through the South- 
west land of enchantment. The time, Chicago to Los 
Angeles, is about 68 hours, which is fast speed for 
the 2265 miles traversed, considering that several 
mountain ranges are crossed.

THE SEASON'S BEST BOOKS 



THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MONCURE D. CONWAY 

" It would be difficult to name any other biography which contains so extraordinary a list of so prominent literary 
or scientific names in England or in America. It is safe to say that for personal anecdotes the book is unequaled, and 
that neither Boswell's Johnson nor Lockh&rt's Scott contains so many separate entries. It is also true that Mr, 
Conway's perceptions are so keen and his literary handling at once so graphic and so well trained that there is not. 
a dull page in the book. At any rate, it gains in constant interest from beginning to end. To these gifts is to be 
added a freedom from personal vanity and a conscientious desire to do justice to all." — The Nation, New York. Illus'

DEAN BalGOS 



LETTERS OF JOHN RUSKIN TO CHARLES ELIOT NORTON 

A man's letters to his closest friend would often make his best biography. Such is the case with these letters from 
John Ruskin to Charles Eliot Norton. They are, in fact, a sort of autobiography ; for they are the most familiar 
and self-revelatory of Ruskin's letters hitherto printed. In them he discloses his intimate moods, his inner purposes, 
his hopes and fears, his doubts and ambitions. Two volumes, with many portraits, $4.00 net. Postage extra.

Presenting a Conservative Southerner's yiews on the Present 
Relations of the Two Races in the South, with an Account 
of the Steps by which these Relations have Come About. 

To the great value and interest of the work in itself much is added by the

that have been made since the war ; in short, this book presents the ma-

The most casual reading of his work is sufficient to show what pains

accuracy at every step. But no one is likely to rest content with a 
casual reading, for the quality which chiefly distinguishes the volumes 
is that of enthralling interest.

Mr. Lee has been said to have "something

trate it as forcibly. 

The lectures with which Mr. Sidney Lee

a group of biographical studies which admirably illustrate his exceptional 
power in this direction.

"If 'The Great American Novel' must 
not be, of necessity, a whole library of

"'The Undercurrent' should prove a more popular novel even than the author's earlier work. The dis-

The latest novel by Henry 'James 

The Golden Bowl 

By HENRY JAMES 
In two volumes i2mo, ;^2.50 



" "-pi 



■HE GOLDEN BOWL" is an "international" 
story, and the contrast between American 
characters and the European background which 
Mr. James has made his own particular province 
furnishes a factor of general and piquant interest. 

It is also a thoroughly dramatic work, and its 
pathos constitutes an element of so much emphasis 
and relief as sharply to singularize the book among 
the author's productions. 

For these reasons, as well as for its unaffected 
simplicity and naturalness, " The Golden Bowl" 
makes a distinctly popular appeal, and is sure to 
attract the widest audience as well as the elect 
whom Mr. James always interests more than any 
other living writer of fiction.

the press for many a day. Every chapter teems with clever- 
ness, it bubbles up and flows over, till one almost feels as if too 
many good things were being given at once. It is the epic 
story of the great fight between the frothy, unstable, speculat- 
ing methods of the modern financier, and the solid, honest, 
unadventurous tradmg of the men who made England at one 
time the first of commercial nations." — Academy.

The Early Day In Railroading 



By FRANK H. SPEARMAN 

DURING the last five years extraordinary strug- 
gles have arisen between contending finan- 
cial interests for supremacy in control among 
American railroads. The story of the strategy 
of those fights is one of real fascination. An 
enormous capital has been expended in rebuild- 
ing the transcontinental systems and links and 
the Atlantic trunk lines. New railroad wilder- 
nesses have been thrown open and states almost 
rediscovered. Mr. Spearman has put the story 
of all this concisely into his book, and it will 
appeal to those who have followed his railroad 
stories and enjoy a presentation of striking and 
dramatic features of railroad life and operation.

of the very few men in this country who are writing 
poetry of distinction in form and profound in its in-

among American poets by the Odes to "Music" 
and <'God of the Open Air," by the sonnet "Patria," 
and by the lyrics "Light Between the Trees" and 
" A Mile with Me." These are poetry of a high

The Temper of the 17th Century in English Literature 

(Clark Lectures given at Trinity College, Cambridge, 1902-1903.) 
By BARRETT WENDELL, Professor of English at Harvard College. 

PROFESSOR Wendell's special purpose in this animated and sug- 
gestive review" of seventeenth-century literature in England is 
to indicate, as he says in his preface, "the manner in which the 
national type of England, as revealed in seventeenth-century litera- 
ture, changed from a temper ancestrally common to modern England 
and to modern America, and became, before the century closed, 
something which later time must recognize as distinctly, specifically 
English." The work has an additional interest because the chap- 
ters constituting it were the first regular lectures concerning English 
literature ever given by an American in an English University.

FLORENCE IN THE 

POETRY OF 

THE BROWNINGS 

S an actual gift-book this alto- 
gether admirable volume covers 
a wider field than almost any similar 
publication of the present season. 
Mrs. Anna Benneson McMahan, 
whose entire familiarity with the 
Browning poetry and with Florence 
itself is well known, has compiled the 
volume with the utmost sympathy and appreciation. To both poets the history, the scenery, the 
art of Florence was a continual inspiration — "the most beautiful of the cities devised by man," as 
Mrs. Browning said. The poems comprise " Casa Guidi Windows," "The Dance," "Old 
Pictures in Florence," " Fra Lippo Lippi," " Andrea del Sarto," " The Statue and the Bust," 
*' The Ring and the Book " (Book I), and " One Word More." In itself this would seem to be 
enough, but the interest is further enhanced by over sixty beautiful reproductions of the famous 
paintings and scenes which have been immortalized. It will be seen that the book appeals equally 
to lovers of art, lovers of Florence, and lovers of Browning, — surely a wide field. The sumptuous 
limited editions are as beautiful examples of modern book-making as the most exacting connoisseur 
could desire, while in its regular edition the book is a veritable treasure as a reference guide.

CONSIDERATION of a suitable gift for the library of a book-lover need go 
no further than the limited editions of the McClurg Americana reprints. 
Seldom has the perfection of modern book-making, as represented by noble 
and dignified simplicity, been so nearly attained as in these beautiful volumes. 
The three titles so far issued, uniform in style, make-up, and binding, are 
printed on Brown's hand-made paper, with illustrations on Japan vellum, and 
bound in boards with vellum backs stamped in gold. It may be imagined 
with what pleasure any of these would be received by an appreciative col- 
lector of Americana or of fine editions.

MY LADY OF THE NORTH 

EVERYONE knows what a large proportion of the people who receive 
Christmas gifts are best pleased with a fine, exciting story, full of 
romance, and well illustrated with pictures in color. Such a book is not 
expensive, and it is almost certain to give perfect satisfaction. 

For this purpose Mr. Randall Parrish's " love story of a Gray- 
Jacket" can be unhesitatingly recommended as the best possible choice. 
It has all the requirements, and it is equally interesting to men and women 
(and even to younger readers). The many baffling situations which con- 
front Captain Wayne of the — th Virginia Cavalry before he finally wins his 
" Lady of the North " are certain to hold the reader's breathless interest. 
Illustrated in color by E.M. Ashe. $1.50. 

STIRRING FICTION FOR CHILDREN 

WHEN the age of fairy-lore is passed, the next tendency of young readers is 
generally towards a story with plenty of exciting adventure for the youth- 
ful hero or heroine. Two ideal books of this class are Miss Sanford's " The 
Wandering Twins" and Ernest Glanville's "In Search of the Okapi." 

The first tells of the adventures of two children in Labrador, and leads them through a 
succession of strange and unusual occurrences. With eight full-page illustrations, $i.2§. 
Mr. Glanville's story is in the true Henty style, dear to the boyish heart, and tells 
of the adventures which befell two young explorers on a journey into the strangest parts of 
Africa. There is any amount of the most thrilling excitement, and it will be the book of 
all others for a healthy boy of almost any age. With eight full-page illustrations. $1.^0. 

LIFE STORIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE 

FOR parents who feel disposed to give their children books that provide a 
mild element of historical information, as well as first-class entertainment, 
this new series will prove a veritable find. The little books are translated 
from the German by George P. Upton, and each one tells in a simple and cap- 
tivating style the story of some great life that has figured in the world's history. 
The volumes so far published are "William Tell," "Mozart," "The 
Maid of Orleans," and " Beethoven," and many more are contemplated. 
Each is a small square i6mo in uniform binding.^ with ^ illustrations. 60 cts. net. 

WHEN LITTLE BOYS SING 

THIS delightful book, by John and Rue Carpenter, is one of the most engaging 
holiday books of the entire season. Quaint colored illustrations of little boys 
of the "long ago," with verses set to charming music that is intended to be sung to 
little music-lovers, its originality and freshness make it almost as attractive to older 
people as to the children themselves. It is one of those books which create a sense of 
delightful anticipation at the first glimpse of the cover, and a final realization that here, 
at least, is something really new. Bound in colored chintz.^ iixi^ inches. $1.25 net. 

THE LITTLE GIANT 

ALTHOUGH the late Dr. Thomas Dunn English was most generally known as the author of 
" ^tn Bolt," his own greatest pleasure was in the telling of stories for little children. Four 
fairy tales that have hitherto been undiscovered have been collected in this volume, and they will 
be recognized as coming from a practiced hand. They have been most attractively illustrated by 
Lucy Fitch Perkins, whose fame as an artist of fairyland is now established. Price $1.00 net.

THE STORY OF MY STRUGGLES 

The memoirs of Arminius Vamhery, C. K. O., Professor 
of Oriental Languages in the University of Budapest. 
With illustrations. 2 volumes, 8vo, cloth, ^^.00 net. 

IN this book, Professor Vamb^ry, than whom no Hungarian is better known to the English-speaking 
world, gives a full and detailed account of all the vicissitudes of his career. His life has been, indeed, 
an extraordinarily romantic one. Fatherless, lame, and almost penniless, he was compelled, when a mere 
child, to shift for himself, and up to the age of eighteen his life was a constant struggle against starvation. 
Yet by the time he had reached his twentieth year he had become one of the most accomplished linguists 
in Europe. Vamb^ry's most famous feat was his great journey through Central Asia. For this he adopted 
the dress of a Dervish, and traveled to Khiva with a herd of fanatics, who, had they discovered him, would 
have torn him to pieces. He visited Bokhara, Samarkand, and all the Oxus country in complete safety. 
Few men have been so closely connected with leading men and women as has Vamb^ry. His personal 
friendship for the last three Sultans of Turkey and the last two Shahs of Persia is as much a matter of 
notoriety as the high respect in which he was held by the late Queen Victoria, a respect which is fully 
shared by her son. King Edward, who has conferred upon him the Victorian Order.

THE LAND OF RIDDLES (Russia of To-day) By Hugo Ganz 

An inside study of Russian political and social conditions which answers many of 
those questions which intelligent people to-day are asking about Russia. Dr. Ganz 
is a well-known writer of Vienna who was afforded exceptional opportunities for 
getting at the heart of matters in Russia. The work is brought thoroughly down to 
date, and is most keen, critical, and illuminating in its treatment.

THE WONDERS OF LIFE By Ernst Haeckel 

A Supplementary Volume to " The Riddle of the Universe^ 
The enormous success attained by Professor Haeckel's earlier volume. The Middle 
of the Universe, has led him to put forth another volume, which takes up in detail 
many biological questions only cursorily touched upon in the other work. The 
present volume is confined to the realm of organic science, and treats of "The 
Knowledge, Nature, Functions, and History of Life." Professor Haeckel's inter- 
esting and illuminating writings need no comment.

THE CYCLE OF LIFE According to Modern Science By C. W. Saleeby

ranging from Evolution to the Scientific Season for Love.

rather than a keen-minded and astute ruler bent on promoting the grandeur of his 
empire. Illustrated. Crown 8vo, uncut edges, gilt top, $2.25 net. 

THE COMMON WAY By Margaret Deland 

These essays for women, which were written for Harper's Bazar, are so vital, so

to Women," which well describes these luminous, common-sense papers.

the bishop's silver candlesticks, from Victor 
Hugo' s masteT-piece, Les Miserables. The episode 
is a complete story in itself, and the scene be- 
tween the bishop and the ex-convict is one of 
the most impressive in all literature.

THE AGE OF R EPRINT. 

Four yards of Thackeray, roughly measured,, 
just now standing on the editorial desk, prompt 
us to a few reflections, apposite enough at any 
time of the year, and peculiarly seasonable at 
this time of the approaching holidays. It 
appears to be Thackeray in the present instance ;. 
it mdght just as well be Shakespeare or Seott 
or Dickens or Carlyle. These huge boxes of 
old books in new editions are among the most 
familiar of our visitors, yet their appearance is 
an unfailing cause of wonder, and of amusedl 



360

speculatian concerning- their presumable pur- 
chasers and readers. That they find purchasers 
is clear enough; they would not come to us in 
such seemingly endless procession except in 
response to a corresponding demand. Con- 
sidered as articles of commerce, they are evi- 
dently sure of their market. Carlyle is as staple 
a product as corn or cotton; Thackeray is no 
less steady an object of consumption than 
tobacco or tea. The publisher of these editions 
takes no more risk than the farmer who raises 
his crop; Ms product is subject to the usual 
market fluctuations, but is reasonably assured 
of yielding a return of the cost of production. 
The output, moreover, increases from year to 
year with the increase of population, just as the 
production of wheat increases, thus verifying 
the saying that man shall not live by bread 
alone. 

Pursuing still further the economic analogy, 
many other facts may be noted concerning this 
branch of manufacturing industry. Applica- 
tion of the principle of division of labor is so 
"thoroughgoing, and use of labor-saving machin- 
•ery is so general, that cost is reduced to an 
; astonishingly low figure, and even this minimum 
tends constantly toward a lower point. The 
economic gain resulting from large produc- 
tion is realized to the full, and indications of 
trust metho'ds of controlling the market have 
been noticeable of recent years. Pressure is put 
upon retailers who show a tendency to cut prices 
or offer secret rebates, and we even have the 
phenomenon of editions for export offered at 
lower prices than these made to supply the 
home market. Shipping our American-made 
Shakespeares and Scotts to London, for the 
purpose of underselling the products of the 
pauper printers of England, is a veritable send- 
ing of coals to Newcastle, but why should we 
not do with reading-matter what we have 
so successfully learned to do with steel rails? 
Even the more recondite regions of economic 
theory may be illustrated by literature in 
its commercial aspect; we find exemplified 
the law of diminishing returns when we turn 
from Dickens and Thackeray to the exploita- 
tion of less popular authors, and the pub- 
lisher is confronted with the farmer's old 
problem of choice between intensive and exten- 
sive cultivation. Finally, we may suggest 
that in offering to the public its favorite 
authors in a great variety of editions, many 
a purchaser, succumbing to temptation, becomes 
the owner of two or three Carlyles or Macaulays 
or Shakespeares, thereby illustrating the doc- 
trine of marginal utility and cheapening to the 
level of cost what should be the most priceless 
of possessions. 

It is not denying the patent fact that new 



books are now being written in greater num- 
bers than ever to assert that the present age is 
an age of reprint. Of the new books we have 
here nothing to say, because our present con- 
cern is with the extraordinary multiplication of 
the old ones, a multiplication without parallel 
in the past. It takes every conceivable form 
and is made upon every imaginable pretext. 
An extensive collection of sets of standard 
authors may result from the invention of a new 
quality of paper, or a new device in binding, 
or a new idea about methods of bookselling. 
An original taste for decorative effect may make 
the future of a whole library of literature. The 
talent of some new illustrator may require the 
production of a long series of editions whose 
only raison d'etre is the exercise of that par- 
ticular talent upon the text. The individuality 
of some neat or brilliant critic may make 
imperative many rows of reprints brought into 
existence solely that he may be their editor. An 
unanswerable argument for a new edition is 
always offered by the unearthing of material 
hitherto omitted. 'Victor and Cazire' is 
brought to light, and straightway there must be 
a new edition of the whole of Shelley. A 
few fragments of Lamb or Poe or Thackeray 
are ferretted out from the files of ancient 
newspapers, and create a crying need for 
new editions of those writers. A batch of 
letters is unearthed, and at once all the old edi- 
tions of the author who wrote them must give 
way to the new edition which shall include these 
letters also. It does not matter how trivial or 
even worthless these acquisitions are; they 
afford a sufficient pretext for an up-to-date 
canon. Sometimes, through excess of zeal, the 
new matter ascribed to an author is afterwards 
proved not to have 'been written by him, and 
then there must be still another new edition 
which shall leave it out. How skilfully editors 
and publishers work upon their victims to 
persuade them that they really must buy these 
new editions, or be consigned to the outer dark- 
ness wherein grope those bibliophiles who shirk 
their responsibilities, is well known to all who 
have ever given a thought to the psychology of 
the bookish public. 

All this passion for accuracy and completeness 
is in a general way commendable, yet it becomes 
somewhat ridiculous when it is expended upon 
authors of the second or third class. And in 
any case it proves a severe strain upon the 
resources of scholars, who are about the only 
persons to whom textual integrity really mat- 
ters. One unfortunate result of the artificial 
appetite for ' sets ' of the authors is the oppor- 
tunity offered unscrupulous publishers to prey 
upon an uncritical public. Here the ' subscrip- 
tion' publisher finds his opportunity, and he

maJces the most of it. His wares are of a sort 
that intelligent and scholarly readers reject by 
instinct, but he knows better than to make his 
appeal to them, or to seek to dispose of his 
editions through the natural trade channels. 
He aims instead at the unwary rich, and they 
fall his victims in surprising numbers. His 
editions are apt to be ^ faked,' they are tricked 
out with showy illustrative material, they are 
provided with a vulgar and pretentious dress, 
and the smooth-tongued canvasser is trusted to 
work them off. They are sold for two or three 
times their cost, and their publisher flourishes 
at the expense of gullible book-buyers who 
rarely learn how shrewdly they have been 
imposed upon. Of course, there are occasion- 
ally offered ' subscription sets ' that are con- 
scientiously made and in every way desirable, 
but such are the exception rather than the rule. 
In most cases the edition that is marketed upon 
this plan is one that a discriminating book- 
man would not put upon his shelves at any 
price. 

Such publications are designed for ignorant 
purchasers of the affluent class; for buyers of 
limited means a counterpart is offered by the 
editions manufactured for the special needs of 
the dry goods trade, the department store, and 
the popular auction-room. These objects have 
the appearance of books, but they offer an 
affront to every bookish sense. They illustrate 
the extreme of cheapness in every detail; they 
are printed from worn plates with bad ink 
upon coarse paper that will soon turn yellow 
and rot ; their binding is muslin of the flimsiest, 
or of leather that will crumble at a touch after 
a few years. And how curiously restricted is 
their range! The same popular novelists, the 
same old-fashioned historians, and the same 
democratic assembly of poets greet us in one 
shop after another, offered at bargain prices, 
and passed over the counters by salespeople who 
know nothing of their contents and to whom 
they are merely so much merchandise. Truly, 
the public is beset by a plague of books of this 
sort, and literature is hopelessly vulgarized by 
the indignity thus done to it. 

Upon another occasion, we propose to ask 
what becomes of all the books thus cheaply and 
excessively multiplied, and to inquire whether 
this age of reprint is correspondingly an age 
of advanced culture. 



It is announced that 'The Burlington Magazine' 
will hereafter be published in this country by Mr. 
Robert Grier Cooke of New York. By the authori- 
tative character of its text and the beauty of its 
external form, the 'Burlington' has achieved an 
enviable position among the world's art period- 
icals. Under the new management it should find 
its way to a large circle of American connoisseurs.

A Later 'Old Pepys.'* 

The descendants of Mr. Samuel Pepys can 
hardly be expected to regard his literary career 
with unalloyed satisfaction. From an imper- 
sonal point of view it is easy to condone his 
many faults, and impossible not to enjoy his 
vivacious memorial of them ; but as an ancestor 
he certainly lacks dignity. The simplicity and 
pettiness to which he owes his fame may repre- 
sent a type of genius, and the famous Diary is 
undoubtedly unique in literature; but as 
a family heirloom it has its obvious disad- 
vantages, which we cannot expect the Pepys 
family to ignore. It is only natural for the 
more serious-minded members of this family to 
wish, now and then, that the too garrulous 
chronicles had remained in the decent obscurity 
of short-hand, and that it had been left to 
some more decorous Pepys to immortalize the 
family name. To this serious-minded faction 
belongs Miss Alice C. C. Gaussen, a descendant 
from a collateral branch of the Pepys family; 
and she has undertaken to bring it about that 
the redoubtable Samuel shall not be the only 
Pepys known to fame. 

Miss Gaussen is willing, even anxious, to 
give Samuel his due. She cannot enjoy the 
ignominious self-revelation of his Diary, but 
as a faithful record of the century in which he 
lived she admits its charm. She reminds us, 
too, quoting Robert Louis Stevenson for the 
purpose, that Pepys's public career was wholly 
to his honor, and that, in sharp contrast to the 
' indecent familiarity ' with which his name is 
now bandied about, he was looked upon by his 
own generation with distant respect and even 
awe. King James had such regard for him that 
he would not let even so momentous an event 
as the landing of William interrupt his sitting 
for a portrait which he intended as a present 
for Samuel Pepys: a touching tribute, surely! 
How proud might the Pepys family be of 
Samuel, if he had not yielded to temptation and 
kept a diary ! 

But Miss Gaussen hastens to assure us that 
there is another Pepys — ' A Later Pepys,' for 
so her title distinguishes him, — about whom 
no such reservations are necessary-. The private 
life of this ' later Pepys ' was as delightful as 
his public career was honorable; sharing his 
kinsman's ' faculty of revealing his ever}' 
thought,' he was unlike that kinsman in ' pos- 
sessing a mind that could afford to think 
aloud.'

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



Sir William Weller Pepys, this later and 
more estimable representative of the family, 
was born in 1740 and died in 1825, the very 
year of the publication of the unfortunat(3 
Diary. He was, we are told, a Master in Chan- 
cery ; but it is more to the purpose that he was 
also a wit and a famous conversationalist in 
the days when the ' Bas Bleu ' flourished and 
conversation was still an art. Bos well desig- 
nated him as being ' well known in polite cir- 
cles.' The great Johnson assured Mrs. Thrale 
that he should have liked Pepys better if she 
had praised him less, and more than once ran 
amuck of his literary tastes or his Whig prin- 
ciples. It was Johnson, too, who dubbed Mrs. 
Montague 'queen of the blues,' and William 
Pepys her ' prime minister.' Fanny Bumey's 
Memoirs contain many a pleasant reference to 
him, bearing witness to his ' fashionable air, 
dress and address," to which 'he added great 
shrewdness and drollery ' ; and to the success of 
his ' Bas Bleu ' assemblies, whose groups were 
' less awful than at Mrs. Montague's, and less 
awkward than at Mrs. Vesey's.' Hannah More 
even goes so far as to call him the ' chief orna- 
ment ' of the select society of wits and scholars 
of his time. Horace Walpole offers the char- 
acteristic bit of information that Sir William's 
nose was ' as long as himself.' 

Such comments as these, contained in Miss 
Gaussen's initial sketch of Sir William's life, 
stimulate interest. So do the other introduc- 
tory chapters with their anecdotes of the blue- 
stocking parties and some of the leading 
'Blues,' their account (from Fanny Bumey's 
diary) of a series of gallant battles between 
Johnson and William Pepys, and their descrip- 
tions of the ways of the wits at Bath and Tun- 
bridge Wells, and of the dress, manners, and 
literary standards of polite society in William 
Pepys's day. The best society of the eighteenth 
century may not have been any better than that 
of other centuries, but it was certainly more 
fortunate in its chroniclers. Fanny Burney, 
Boswell, and Mrs. Thrale have been often 
drawn upon, but their resources have never 
been exhausted; and Miss Gaussen's point of 
view enables her to present well-known mate- 
rial in a fresh light, as well as to add a good 
deal that is intrinsically new. Sir William is 
not exactly the central figure in these chapters, 
but he is the point of departure. When we 
have finished them we have placed him in the 
familiar Johnsonese background, — have met 
his friends and heard their tributes to his 
probity, benevolence, and classical learning, his 
kindly heart and cultivated memory, his ani- 
mated talk and his charming letters. For it 
was to letter-writing that this second Pepys 
devoted his literary energies. He had nothing 
to conceal in a short-hand journal. He medi- 



tated playing Boswell to some of his illustrious 
friends, but he never did — we can easily see 
why. Instead, he turned to letter-writing, 
unfailing resource of all gentlemanly scrib- 
blers; and there is evidence to show that like 
his friend Horace Walpole, ' prince of letter- 
writers,' he intended some of them at least for 
a wider audience than the individual recipient. 
It is of letters that Sir William Pepys wrote, 
together with some that he received, that the 
bulk of Miss Gaussen's two thick volumes are 
made up. 

Of Sir William's own letters there are three 
groups: a Chesterfieldian series, written when 
he was still young, to a younger cousin at 
Oxford; a few dated twelve years later, to hiS' 
eldest son; and a big batch, written during a. 
platonic friendship of forty years' standing, to- 
Hannah More. It may as well be admitted 
first as last that Sir William's letters are not 
so amusing as we had hoped. To use one of hi* 
own favorite aidjectives, they are a little too> 
' blue ' for modem taste. 

The first group is decidedly pedantic. Like 
Lord Chesterfield, Sir William wished his 
young friend to turn out ' an amiable and 
conversible Man in Society, as well as a dis- 
tinguished Character in publick,' and he 
regarded an industrious attention to ' the Ideas 
of the best writers,' particularly of the best 
classical writers, as the certain means to that 
end. We admire his optimism and his latinity ; 
but we cannot help sympathizing a little with 
his young cousin's tardiness in responding t<> 
his kinsman's lengthy epistles, and his reluct- 
ance to give a full account in writing of all 
the passages in the Iliad that 'struck him the- 
most.' It is pleasant to find that after twenty 
years' experience of life Sir William's educa- 
tional theories are far less dogmatic. Or perhaps 
it is only because his eldest son is a delicate 
boy, that he writes him simple little notes, full 
of fatherly wishes for his happiness, and instead 
of urging him to apply himself to the classics, 
bids him remember that no honor of scholar- 
ship is half so valuable as a contented mind in 
a sound body. 

The letters to Mrs. Hannah More are natur- 
ally the best of the three series, refiecting 
much more of Sir William's personality, and 
a little more of the life of the time. One can 
imagine that a platonic friendship with Mrs. 
More would be a pleasant, prosy, serious affair ; 
and the letters that record its progress are of 
the same type, — pleasant, prosy, meditative, 
and very loug-winded. It is a pity that Miss 
Gaussen could not have hunted up one of her 
ancestor's notes to Fanny Bumey, — he must 
have written some, — or to Horace Walpole. 
For the great charm of the eighteenth century 
lies in its ironic juxtapositions, — its bizarre

mingling of the elephantine and the trifling, 
its odd fashion of toying with the one and learn- 
edly expounding the other. Without its John- 
son, its Burke, and its blue-stocking ladies, it 
would have been a vapid farce; without its 
humorists, its gossips, and its busy-bodies, we 
should know very little about it nowadays, — 
and care less. Unfortunatel}^, Sir William's 
letters belong to the ponderous eighteenth cen- 
tury type. In spite of Johnson's cavalier treat- 
ment of him, he persisted in admiring Johnson, 
and his letters have more in common with ' The 
Vanity of Human Wishes ' than with Walpole's 
elegant affectations or Fanny Bumey's lively 
chronicles. Sir William never gossips, and sel- 
dom descends to anecdote; he reflects and 
expounds, theorizes and comments. It is all 
very elevating; we can quite understand his 
correspondents' pleasure in hearing from him, 
but we do not reproduce it. 

On the whole, the letters written to Sir Wil- 
liam are more interesting than those he wrote. 
JNTathaniel Wraxall is the spiciest and most irre- 
sponsible of his correspondents. Major Rennell, 
the great geographer, pouring an encyclopaedic 
fund of information into the ears of his 
delighted hearer, is another decided and very 
genial personality. Sir Lucas Pepys, doing the 
grand tour, writes home conscientious accounts 
of his journeyings. Mrs. Chapone, in the role 
of elderly mentor, advises her young friend in 
love and begs his assistance in poetry. There 
is a budget from the love-lorn Mrs. Hartley of 
Bath, and more sketches of travel from young 
James Macdonald, whose brother Alexander had 
such ill luck in entertaining Johnson during 
his tour of the Hebrides. 

There are too many of the letters; none but 
zealous antiquaries will care to peruse them all. 
The cynic will search through them in vain for 
any hints of mental kinship with Samuel. The 
general reader, skipping judiciously here and 
there, will meet old friends in plenty and make 
new ones as he goes. Hereafter they will all 
associate the name of Pepys with a scholar and 
a gentleman of the old school, — a man of 
striking worth and exemplary conduct; not, 
indeed, a genius who vn-ote a damaging master- 
piece by chance, but a staid and pleasant friend 
and an irreproachable ancestor.

Eakly Maps of America.* 



It is just seventy years since Alexander voO 
Humboldt published, in the first edition of hi-* 
Exam en Critique, his discovery that the name 
America was given to the new world at the sug- 
gestion of a forgotten G-erman geographer by 
the name of Martin Waldseemiiller. In one 
place Waldseemiiller wrote, ' In the sixth 
climate toward the south pole are situaited both 
the farthest part of Africa recently discovered 
. . . and the fourth part of the globe, which, 
since Americus discovered it, may be called 
Amerige, that is the land of Americus or Amer- 
ica ' ; and in another place he said, * Now truly, 
since a fourth part of the world has been dis- 
covered by Americus Vespucius, I do not see 
why Ave may not rightly caU it Amerige, that 
is the land of Americus or America.' These 
passages occur in his Cosmographiae Introduc- 
tion printed in 1507 at St. Die in Lorraine, in 
which a letter of Vespucius, describing four 
voyages to the new world, was printed as an ap- 
pendix. The sub-title of the book reads, ' A de- 
scription of an universal cosmography, both in 
solid and in plane, in which there have been in- 
serted the things, unknown to Ptolemy, which 
have recently been discovered.' From this sub- 
title, and from further references in the dedica- 
tion and the text, it is clear that the book was 
intended to accompany a globe and a map of the 
world. For some thirty years cartographers 
have known a single copy of a set of gores, 
formerly belonging to General Hauslab, in 
which South America bears the name America, 
and some have supposed that they were the 
work of Waldseemiiller. But no trace of the 
map of the world had ever been found, until 
it was discovered three years ago, by Father 
Joseph Fischer, Professor of Geography in the 
Jesuit college at Feldkirch in the Tyrol. The 
map was found in the library of Prince Wald- 
berg, at his castle of Wolfegg, in southern' 
Wiirtemberg. Together with the map of 1507^ 
there was also found a marine chart made bj 
Waldseemiiller in 1516, the existence of which 
had scarcely been suspected, though some such 
chart was listed in 1570 in the catalogue of 
Ortelius. But slight account of these discov- 
eries was given at the time, Professor Fischer 
preferring to postpone a description of the maps 
until their publication in exact fac-simile. In 
editing them, he has had the assistance of Profes- 
sor von Wieser of the University of Innsbruck ; 
and their recent issue is an important contribu- 
tion to the history of cartography and the his- 
tory of America.

COMMUNICA TION. 



A NEW SPECIES OF UNIVERSITY, 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 
There has recently appeared in the advertising 
pages of certain magazines a prosj>ectus of a new 
and remarkable institution, established in the 
City of Washington. Its name is the Intercon- 
tdnental Correspondence University, and its 
motto is ' The World our Class Eoom.' There is 
no mention of the other planets. 

The President of this institution, Dr. Channing 
Rudd, has issued a pamphlet entitled 'The Per- 
sonal Statement of the President,' which is sent 
to all who apply. It contains a 'foreword' which 
states that 
•WE^ 

David J. Brewer, 

Henry Billings Brown, 
Walter C. Clephane, 
Chauncey M. Depew, 
George F. Hoar, 

Edward Everett Hale, 
Martin A. Knapp, 

Henry B. F. Macfarland, 
Channing Eudd, 
have founded the Intercontinental Correspondence 
University because we believe that there is a field 
in the educational world unoccupied, and that this 
field is as broad as the world itself,' etc., etc. 

' 2 Just to refresh your memory, I will briefly mention 
some well-known facts about my co-founders.' [They fol- 
low, in the manner of ' Who's Who.'] 

Turning over the page, we find the personal 
statement itself, beginning thus : 

* Do YOU 

Need, or want, or desire, or wish 
A better educational equipment for the business 
of life? 
A better special education? 
A better general education? 

A better partial education? 
Any item of information? 

Any part of any phase of knowledge? 
The mastery of any subject? 

or any part of any subject?' 

It is understood that this is not intended for 
a skit on Walt Whitman. It is not even 
intended to be poetry. But let us proceed : 

' There are thousands of men and women in the 
world today who need a better education, and to 
whom such an education has heretofore been out of 
reach. ... I am in a position to say to these 
men and women, and do say, write to me and I will 
assist you in learning anything you desire to know. 
I am in a position to say this without qualification. 
There is no department of knowledge which can not 
be taught, and I am prepared to demonstrate that 
anj^ department of knowledge which can be taught, 
can be taught by mail. We shall, therefore, teach 
everything which is teachable. For this reason our 
institution is called a University. It is universal 
in its function as a teacher. It embraces everything. 
It omits nothing. An undertaking the like of which 
has never heretofore been attempted in the history 
of the world. ... I believe that the methods 
that prevail in many schools, colleges and univer- 
sities are antiquated and old-fashioned. . . . 
This University gives just as thorough an education 
as any school, college or university in the world. 



but it is stripped of all unnecessary hampering by 
method.' 

Where is to be found the faculty who will 
thus dispense all wisdom? We turn the pages 
with bated breath, fearing to learn that the 
professors of Harvard, Oxford, Cambridge, and 
Berlin have seceded in a body and are now on 
their way to Washington. But not so; the 
faculties of those places are fossilised, anyway, 
and would be quite unsuited for the I. C. U. 

' The Faculty of the I. C. U. is divided into two 
groups — the Eegular Faculty and the Advisory 
Faculty. Space does not permit me to tell you 
about all of the various Deans, Professors, Text- 
writers, Instructors, etc. It is sufiicient to state 
that I have placed at the head of these Faculties 
two of the ablest and most efficient educators in the 
world. ' 

We then learn that Dr. J. F. Crowell is Edu- 
cational Director, and Dr. W. T. Harris is 
Chainnan of the Advisory Faculty. Not 
another member of the numerous faculties is 
mentioned. ' Dr. Harris,' — the name sounds 
familiar; oh yes, to be sure: 

' William Torrey Harris, LL. D.,^^ is recognized 
throughout the civilized globe as one of the fore- 
most educators of any age. Thousands call him the 
greatest living philosopher; Americans call him the 
Chief of the greatest Educational system, and all 
recognize in him a tremendous power for good. Not 
on account of these things, but because of his true 
worth as a scholar, a thinker and a man — did we 
choose him as the Chairman of our Advisory Fac- 
ulty.' 

And a foot note: 

' ^- As you know, the public school system of the United 
States is the best in the world. It has over fifteen million 
students, and over four hundred and thirty thousand 
teachers. The annual expenditure is over two hundred 
and twenty-six million dollars, of which the teachers 
receive one hundred and forty-two million dollars in 
annual salaries. The Chairman of our Advisory Faculty, 
Hon. William Torrey Harris, has been for fifteen years, 
and is now, at the head of this great system.' 

It is not explicitly stated that the said system 
will be annexed to the I. C. U. 

The president also sends a typwrittten letter. 
As it is manifestly of a circular nature, and 
was in reply to a perfectly bald request for the 
pamphlet, it may be permissible to quote : 

' My dear Mr. Cockerell: 

' I take great pleasure in complying with your 
request. ... I hope that you will carefully fol- 
low the little " heart to heart " talk contained in 
the ' ' statement, ' ' and let me know what you think 
of it. . . . There are doubtless some things it 
leaves unexplained. . . . The chief aim in life is 
progress. No matter how high a position you 
occupy, you can progress. It is our purpose to help 
you advance, to lead forth and chrystalize {sic) 
your ambitions and aptitudes into first-class ability. 
We want you to be a pleasure and profit to your- 
self and your associates. We want you to become 
a useful laborer in the great workshop of human 
endeavor. So let us begin together, you and I — 
and let me hear from you soon. 

' Yours, for knowledge.' 

What are we to say to all this? I have not

quoted all the above for the sake of mere 
hilarity. It is a serious matter for this country 
that it should be possible for a body of men of 
undoubted high ability and wide reputation to 
put forth such a scheme, heralded in such a 
manner. To me, it seems from beginning to 
end in the most wretched taste; yet it cannot 
SO' seem to the promoters, who are no innocents 
from an unswept comer of the world. Probably 
it will seem all right to a large section of the 
public. If I am wrong, may I be forgiven; 
but frankly, I should despair of a nation to 
wthich the prospectus of the I. C. U. appeared a 
fit and natural thing. Setting aside the ques- 
tion of taste, it appears to me to be nonsense. 
Every scientific man believes in the correspon- 
dence method, conducts a correspondence school 
himself. I have nothing against the method in 
reason; but to advance the view that education 
by correspondence is a fit substitute for per- 
sonal contact is a totally different matter. It 
is the result of a mechanical conception of edu- 
cation which is the natural and hateful product 
of a commerciail age. Moreover, even if it were 
possible to teach as well through the mails as 
any other way, where is the faculty to come 
from ? Money will not multiply the really first 
class men in the country, and what is more, 
such men will not follow the methods of the 
I. C. U., which would be extremely wasteful of 
their time and energy. It is all very well to 
be a trustee or the chairman of a faculty, but 
it is not without reason that we hear nothing 
about the names of the actual teachers. Prob- 
ably the faculties will really contain some well- 
known names, but of necessity the work of 
teaching, where 'You may start at any time. 
There are no regular classes; you will be in a 
class by yourself will have to be turned over 
to the mules of the profession. 

There is undoubtedly a useful field for a cor- 
respondence-school in Washington. A body of 
reasonably competent men, able to consult the 
national libraries and collections and extract 
desired information therefrom, would be very 
serviceable. A great amount of such work is 
done by the Government Bureaus, and I think 
very properly and usefully; but it might very 
well be supplemented by an institution charging 
fees for work not properly within the scope of 
the government, or too extensive for it to under- 
take. I formerly hoped that the Carnegie Insti- 
tution might do this sort of work, andl if the 
I. C. U. can settle down to this or any other 
reasonable field of activity we may be duly 
thankful. If it can then find a more acceptable 
name, we may even come to regard it with 
affection: — but it was asked of old, how shall 
the leopard change his spots?

A :n^ew Portrait of "Old Hickory."* 

A new portrait of the most unique of the 
great Americans who have reached the highest 
positions in military and civil life is to be 
welcomed. We have the great work of Parton, 
written more than a generation ago; the hostile 
study of Professor Sumner, who condemned 
almost everything that Jackson favored, while 
he appreciated the quality of his manhood ; the 
appreciative sketch of Mr. W. GT. Brown; and 
the studies of Jackson to be found in the his- 
tories of the times. Still there is room for a 
new study of this remarkable man from the 
point of view of today, and the greatness of his 
influence upon the development of our institu- 
tions and our political life would seem to 
demand it. 

Mr. Buell, who did not live to see his book 
in print, has written with enthusiasm for his 
subject, and has put into the work a great 
amount of labor; but he can hardly be said to 
have met the demand for a modern life of Jack- 
son. His letters show that from the reading 
of his first book at the age of seven years, — 
Judge Alexander Walker's 'Jackson and New 
Orleans', ' — when his imagination and his 
interest were captured, the personality and 
achievements of General Jackson have been a 
life-study with Mr. Buell, and that he has not 
only read everything in print or manuscript 
that he could find concerning him, but that an 
even more important part of his preparation 
for writing this book were personal interviews 
with many of those who had known General 
Jackson as friends and acquaintances ; and some 
of these interviews bring out the personality of 
the subject most vividly. 

The book is very interesting, for Mr. Buell's 
long experience in newspaper work has taught 
him how to tell a story well, and the career of 
Jackson furnishes material that even a poor 
writer could hardly make uninteresting. But 
with all his facility as a writer, and his study 
and loving care in working out the story of 
Jackson's life, he fails through lack of judicial 
fairness to make a biography which shall satisfy 
the thoughtful student of our national life. 
While he seems to try to be fair, he has adopted 
many of Jackson's own prejudices, and the book 
fails to ring true for this reason. And to some 
of these prejudices he gives expression so often 
that the reader loses sympathy with him in his 
narrative. One of these prejudices is that

and impressed many who never read the book. 
More than that, the book expressly restricted 
the name to the southernmost part of the 
southern continent. Upon the map the name 
was placed upon the same part of the conti- 
nent; but, being the only general name upon 
the continent, it was naturally taken, in the 
absence of other names and of the restrictions 
in the text, to apply to the whole. With this 
understanding it was copied in other maps and 
globes, and especially in the globes made by 
Schoner. It was Schoner who in 1533 made 
the first suggestion, in his Opusculuw, 
Geographicum, that Vespucius was himself 
instrumental in applying his own name to the 
new world; but it is not always noted that he 
nevertheless retained the name America upon 
the globe that accompanied this tract. In his 
cordiform map of 1538, and in his globe gores 
of 1541, Mercator completed the work by 
extending the name America to both continents. 
But for the influence of the map of 1507, the 
suggestion of the Cosmographice Iritroductio 
would probably have produced slight effect. 

The present maps are doubtless as important 
in their relation to the cartography of the old 
world as to that of the new ; but it is only the 
latter relation that can be here noted. A full 
appreciation of their content and import must 
necessarily be the work of some years. Their 
discovery and publication may give a new 
impulse to the study of cartography. It can 
never be too strongly insisted that history must 
always be studied in the light of contemporary 
maps; and especially is this true of the period 
of discovery, when it is more important for the 
understanding of contemporary thought to 
know what it was supposed had been found 
than it is to know w'hat had really been found. 
This subject has been neglected in the United 
States, but it is to be hoped that sufficient atten- 
tion will be given it in time to come to render 
it possible to construct an atlas of American 
history that is worthy of the name. 

The maps have been issued by the publishers 
in three forms: in sheets in a portfolio, in a 
volume bound uniformly with Nordenskiold^ts 
atlases, and as wall-maps. The bound volume 
is most convenient for detailed study, but tlie 
mounted maps are almost indispensable for 
purposes of exhibition. While the maps are 
most interesting to specialists, they will satisfy 
a natural curiosity on the part of others to see 
the first map bearing the name America, and 
at the same time will afford an instructive 
glimpse of what was supposed in the first £ind 
second decades of the sixteenth century to be 
the form and extent of the world.

Emerson, Poet and Thinker. * 

Similar in form and scope to her previous 
studies on Browning, Tennyson, the Rossettis, 
and William Morris, and designed as a beauti- 
ful gift-book which shall also have a permanent 
vialue in one's library, is Miss Gary's latest work, 
' Emerson, Poet and Thinker.' Before reading, 
one might expect to find here an aftermath, a 
repository of many significant thoughts culled 
from the Emerson centenary. On the contrary, 
the author has chosen for special emphasis the 
less usual aspects of Emerson's mind and 
teachings, and hias avoided, sometimes with too 
apparent effort, a recital of the known factors 
in his outer and inner life. There are pages 
where a brief recalling of familiar incidents 
might enliven and illumine, and at the same 
time aid in the continuity of her study. In the 
main, however, the book is an interesting and 
well-balanced exposition of the subject in its 
restricted phases. Miss Gary has the faculty 
which she ascribes to Emerson, — the ability 
to present many ' an old thought with a new 
face.' To her he has spoken an individual mes- 
sage, and this she has declared with grace and 
earnestness. She has given, not a portrayal of 
the man or the essayist, but rather a study of 
the moral artist, of ' the gracious art with which 
he has made morality beautiful.' 

Early in life, two agencies urged Emerson 
toward soul-searching aspirations, in spite of 
great difficulties in tangible progress: first, the 
poverty in the Emerson home, combined with 
the persistent will toward an education ; second, 
the influence of Mary Moody Emerson, his aunt, 
whose unique personality and potent counsel 
have already gained reflex fame in literature. 
By wide reading and carefully studied note- 
books of his own compilation, by intimate 
acquaintance with many models but no master 
in letters, by free intuitive meditation on the 
Universe and its symbols, Emerson's philosophy 
w!as formulated, so far as it ever had definite 
shape, while he was still a youth in years. Miss 
Gary says truly: 

'It is customary to think of Emerson as "a 
philosopher" and "a, sage," but it is pleasanter, 
and possibly truer, to think of him as forever 
a meditative youth to whom life suddenly unfolded 
its beneficent meaning, making it impossible for 
him to grow old or dispirited. The teachings of 
his boyhood are marvellously like the teachings 
of his age, and the freshness of his response to 
precious intuitions of eternal truth is kept to the 
end of his career.' 

Emphasis is laid upon the tendency of Emer- 
son's young manhood toward ill-healiii, and also 
on his affiliations with many men and women

with radical and unpoised schemes for reform. 
One realizes anew the sanity, * the saving grace 
of common sense/ which saved him from becom- 
ing, on the one hand a pampered invalid, on 
the other a fanatic on sociologidal reforms. As 
youth and man, he had a strange detachment 
from the mere accidents of life in his own 
personality or that of others. This detach- 
ment, this broad altruistic survey of life and 
its laws, rather than the mere incidents of per- 
sonal joy and sorrow, accounts for many of the 
beneficent and some of the disappointing phases 
of his dhai^cter and writings. Not a few of 
his companions in the past and his readers in 
the present have felt this impersonality, and 
have sympathized with Margaret Fuller's baffled 
effort to reach personal contact with the heart 
and soul of Emerson. 

Miss Gary's chapter on Eeligion culminates 
in one emphasized thought, — that Emerson's 
appreciation of Christianity was positive though 
not exclusive, as verified by his words of non- 
conformity, ' Christianity is the most emphatic 
affirmation of spiritual nature, but it is not 
the only nor the last affirmation.' To Emer- 
son, says Miss Cary, Nature wi&s symbolic of 
spirit. His studies and inspiration were not in 
the specific beauties of meadow or stream, but 
in the firmament and the expansive elements. 
In the world of art he suggests Corot and 
Daubigny, interpreting Nature in the large, 
with serenity yet severity. In the chapter which 
treats of the friendship with Carlyle, Miss Cary 
seems to show a marked favoritism for Emer- 
son. Eecognizing, as all students must, the 
contrasts in temperament, in vision, in the form 
of announcing the moral messages, all largely 
in Emerson's favor, many yet receive from Car- 
lyle an inspiration, a vital challenge and force, 
which is often lacking in Emerson. If Carlyle 
was a bit caustic in saying of Emerson's lectures 
that they did not leave ' much to chew the cud 
upon,' he only expressed in blunt words the 
criticism of many a true admirer of Etnerson. 
Is it just to Carlyle to contrast his intrepid 
queries and denunciations of evil with Emer- 
son's serene optimism, under the analogy of ' the 
noisy whining of undisciplined childhood'? 

Turning to Einerson the lecturer, the author 
instances especially his second visit to England, 
and introduces some effective side-lights upon 
the impressions which he left and those that he 
carried away from the home-land where he was 
never quite at home. His distrust of his poetic 
gifts, which long delayed the publication of his 
poems, suggests their threatened loss to national 
literature. That such a loss would have been 
very great no lover of poetry will question. 
Evidently Miss Cary has felt this charm in a 
superlative degree, else she would not indulge 
in such extreme praise, affirming that though 



we search for and find defective metres and 
rhymes and syntax yet ' we shall not have dis- 
turbed by a hair's breadth our inner knowledge 
that we have been pecking and quibbling over 
the loveliest product of our national life.' 

Emerson's editorship of ' The Dial,' his con- 
tributions to it, and the revelation therein of 
his intellectual attitude on many themes of his 
day, receive full attention. His address to the 
readers, in the first number, is quoted at length ; 
while there is also a detailed study of the qual- 
ity and authorship of verse and prose in each 
successive issue. Moreover, an Appendix fur- 
nishes a complete list of all ' The Dial's ' arti- 
cles, with authors specified as far as possible. 
Miss Cary refers to her sources of information 
in Cabot's Life of Emerson, and in the exhaus- 
tive article by Mr. George Willis Cooke in the 
'Journal of Speculative Philosophy' in 1886. 
The reviewer wonders, perhaps, why she did not 
use the later authority on the subject — Mr. 
Cooke's introduction and ascriptions in the 
republication of 'The Dial' in 1902, for the 
Eowfant Club of Cleveland. 

Miss Cary's valuable study of Emierson closes 
with a chapter on the French estimate of him. 
We are familiar with many German criticisms 
and appreciations of our American seer and 
poet; here are words of discriminating praise 
from M. Montegut contributed to the 'Revue 
des Deux Mondes,' in 1847 and 1850, and a re- 
cent estimate in the same journal, in 1902, by M. 
Roz, which raises question regarding the sym- 
pathy of Emerson and the adaptation of his 
optimism to real life. Partially in answer is 
a translation, given by Miss Cary, of M. Maeter- 
linck's essay on Transcendentalism and Symbol- 
ism, with interwoven comments on Emerson as 
illustration, in 'Le Tresor des Humbles.' A 
few sentences fittingly express the responsive 
attitude, not alone of the French critic, but 
also of this latest American biographer. 

'But here at the same moment is Emerson, the 
good shepherd of the morning, in the pale verdant 
meadows of a new optimism, natural and credible. 
He does not insist that we skirt the abyss. He 
does not take us out of the humble, familiar 
inclosure, for the glacier, the sea, the eternal snows, 
the palace, the stable, the funeral pall of the 
pauper, the bed of sickness are all under the same 
heavens, purified by the same stars, and subject 
to the same infinite forces. He has enveloped us 
with silence, with wonder. . . He is nearer than any 
one else to our habitual life. He is the sage of 
the common day, and common days make up the 
sum of our existence.* 

The volume is uniform in appearance with 
Miss Cary's previous books, and like the others 
is a most attractive piece of book-making. Of 
especial interest is the series of photogravure 
illustrations, consisting in the main of portraits 
of Emerson and others of the Concord circle.

IN'EW Books about Japak. * 



Mt. Lafcadio Hearn's latest — and, -unfortu- 
nately, last — ^book is an attempt at the inter- 
pretation of tlie evolution of Japan according 
to the philosophic light and leading of the late 
Herbert Spencer. It is perhaps the best of Mr. 
Heam's wonderful books on the Japan that is 
hidden from the average observer's eyes. The 
steamships bring annually to Nippon's rocky 
shores swarms of pilgrims led by Heam's influ- 
ence. Some of these, with honest and critical 
intent, are unable to see what was so clear to 
this brilliant son of a Greek mother and an 
Irish father; while others, who see not with 
their own eyes, but through those of Hearn, 
rave beyond his ravings. With amazing powers 
of perception and reception, Lafcadio Hearn 
lived a life of singular devotion. Most of his 
writing is subjective, — too much so for the hon- 
est scholar or for one who knows the thought 
and evolution of Japan ^as her age-old literature 
reveals it. In his latest book, however, the 
method is scientific, — coldly and pitilessly sci- 
entific, one might almost say; and throughout 
its pages emotion is held captive to logic. The 
intensity and clearness of its revelation seem 
almost fearful. The author tells us that the 
Japanese are ruled by the dead, and that indi- 
viduality is not known to them. The whole 
social structure is built on ancestor-worship. 
He acknowledges the strangeness and charm 
of the country and people; he tells us of the 
domestic and commun'al cult, sihows us the evo- 
lution of the gods, reveals the strange forma- 
tion (so abhorrent to Occidental ideas) of the 
family in Japan. Then he pictures, with a 
realism almost gruesome, the rule of the dead, — 
until he makes us wonder -whether he is not 
binding the selfsame sheaf with 'the sworn 
enemies of that religion,' whom he holds up to 
such contempt. He re-presents and re-inter- 
prets the history of J^pan in a way that brings 
to mind Winwood Eeade's ' Savage Africa' or his 
' Martyrdom of Man.' The Japanese are super- 
ficially Buddhists; inwardly and to the roots of 
their "being they are Shintoists. Their religion 
is loyalty. Shinto has revived. Occidental 
civilization is only a garment, a cloak. A law 
apart from custom is still practically worthless 
in the interior of the country. Ethics and cus- 
tom are one. The Japanese are still in the pre- 
Homeric stage of evolution. They will win in 
war, but they will sink before the onslaught 
of modem economic forces. Perhaps they are 
already unconsciously forging their own chains.

Such are the pessimistic conclusions of Mr. 
Heam's wonderful appreciation and analysis. 
Happily there are others who do not read his- 
tory or define religion as do Herbert Spencer 
and Lafcadio Hearn, and who see in the very 
constitution of Japanese society the promise 
and potency of a nation that will be able not 
only to out-ride the economic typhoon but also 
to enter into the inheritance of the Occident 
and of the final philosophy and religion — what- 
ever may be the ultimate and perfected fornis 
of these. In conclusion it may be said that in 
literary ch'arm, in brilliancy and depth of color, 
in autumnal ripeness of thought, Mr. Heam's 
' interpretation ' will take its place among the 
best books of the opening century. 

The compilation entitled ' Japan, by the Jap- 
anese ' is the outcome of a visit recently made 
to Japan by Mr. Alfred Steaid, and is primarily 
intended to strengthen the faith of the political 
and financial allies of the islanders who are 
now crossing swords and measuring resources 
with Eussia. The list of contributors includes 
many names of the highest authority, — among 
others some of the noble fifty-five young men 
whose coup d'etat at Kioto in 1868 smote 
duarchv to death and restored monarchy in the 
form of an absolute imperialism, such as Japan 
had never known before in all her history. Sudh 
men, with accuracy in matters economic that 
cannot be challenged, have written freely at Mr. 
Stead's editorial command, or have furnished 
English translations of their speeches or official 
reports. The result is an encyclopaedia of up- 
to-date information that has timely and per- 
manent value. It is curious to note that while 
some of the writers show clearly in style and 
method the repressive and secretive spirit of the 
old feudalism in which they were reared, others 
like Inouve, Shibusawa, and Yamagata are as 
frank as children in disclosing the full truth. 
All that one could wish to know, historically 
and in the light of the latest statistics, about 
Japan's material products, of factory and studio, 
of army and navy, of hygiene and finance, is 
here given with admirable prodigality. Noth- 
ing more in contrtast with the dark and secret 
ways of old Japan of the Tycoon days could 
be imagined. The editorial writer, the finan- 
cier, the student of commercial Japan, will 
heartilv wnelcome this portly store-hoUse of 
varied ' information. Slight in comparison is 
the lia:ht shed on literature, religion, and law 
in the" island empire ; but at the same time the 
chapters on these subjects are the most read- 
able and suggestive of all. The author of 
Bushido (The Knightly Code), the translator 
of the Genji Monogatari (Romance of Prince 
Genji), the brilliant code lawyer and historian, 
and the founder of the Woman's University in 
Tokio are the writers, and they are all adepts in

English style. But, while the reader of this 
book has the ' Open Sesame ' to the material 
treasm-es of Japan, he gains no entrance into 
the invisible world of the Japanese mind. Not 
even the lord of the Imperial Household, though 
he writes m'any pages about ' The Imperial 
-Family,' tells us anything of the Emperor's real 
personality or domestic life. One need only 
peruse carefully the chapters on Japanese 
religion, education, and the position of women, 
to appreciate how deftly the reality is con- 
cealed. Verily, before such charming official 
politeness the average serious student of the 
Japanese will prefer the brutal frankness of 
the alien. Of the absurd preface, which vir- 
tually ignores the labors of over thirty years 
of scholarly research and publication, and of 
the minor faults of compilation and editing, 
we need not spe<ak. For those seeking statistics 
and official history the volume (offers abundant 
measure ; but those desirous of knowing the real 
Japan, and the thoughts and motives actuating 
individual and nation will find between these 
covers little to their purpose. 

An account of 'Japanese Life in Town and 
Country,' written by Dr. George W. Knox of 
the Union Theological Seminary, forms the 
initial volume in a projected series called 'Our 
Asiatic Neigihbors.' The book will hardly delight 
or satisfy those readers who want to know about 
the daily menu, household routine, business 
methods, or wardrobe of the people; but it is 
by no means without its compensations. Per- 
haps the most distinguishing trait of scholiarly 
American writers on Japan lies in the fact that 
they avoid what is merely descriptive or prag- 
matic in externals and try, usually with notable 
success, to show us what is in the Japanese 
brain, and thus reveal to our understanding 
the springs of motive and action. Professor 
Knox is a scholar in Confucianism. Hence he 
knows well how the Japanese gentleman thinks 
and feels, and his sojourns in the homes of 
cultivated Japanese families make his book 
immensely and profitably different from the 
products of those writers to whom the geisha 
is the embodiment of Japanese womanhood. 
Knowing Buddhism well, also, he can tell us 
how the common people look out on the uni- 
verse, and why they enjoy their homeland so 
well. Professor Knox shows admirably that 
the success of Japan's great civilizing popular 
religion was in art, rather than in ethics, or 
spiritual renovation, or inspiration. He sur- 
veys with insight and fascination the historical 
development and intellectual life of the people ; 
he pictures vividly the new Japan that has 
emerged from the old, and ihe now vanished 
' samurai,' whose name is indeed gone, but whose 
life and traditions still animate the plain peo-

The Autobiography of ax AMERicAif 
Admiral. * 



' In preparing this history of forty-five yearss 
of service under the flag of the United States, ' 
says Eear Admiral Schley, at the beginning of 
the preface to his interesting autobiography, 
* the writer has felt that it was his duty, while 
still in vigorous health, to recor<d the incidents 
and activities of a career that has covered many 
important years in the nation's progress.' And 
truly no one will rise from the reading of this 
rather bulky crown-octavo volume without feel- 
ing that he has been taken into the confidence 
of one of the greatest of the men who have 
achieved distinction in our brief yet eventful 
naval history. 

Bom in 1839, at Eiohfields, Maryland, Win- 
field Scott Schley came of mixed German, 
Huguenot French, and Scotch-Irish ancestry, 
his paternal line finding representation in this 
country a hundred years before. His earliest 
years were passed on the farm which saw his 
birth, and in the pleasant little city of Freder- 
ick, his first schooling being received at various 
local academies and at St. John's College. His 
earliest inclination toward the sea came from 
reading Captain Marry at's novels, — an inclina- 
tion shared with hundreds of other healthy lads 
of English speech, though they have nothing of 
nautical achievement to show for it. This, and 
the influence of the gallant soldier from whom 
he was named, took him to the Naval Academy 
at Annapolis, and his life under the flag may be 
said to have begun there on September 20, 1856. 

Naval Cadet Schley was reared in the older 
manner, with sails and spars for his educational 
apparatus and extended cruises in strange 
waters for his discipline. His commission as 
midshipman was received June 19, 1860, — a 
time of portent and grave anxiety. His first 
voyage thereafter was to Japan on the good 
ship ' Niagara,' and the voyage was not accom- 
plished until the return to Boston in May, 1861, 
there to learn of the actual outbreak of hostili- 
ties between the States. Of the decision there 
promptly reached by the young officer, he says : 
'The writer was from Maryland. Before sub- 
scribing to the paper which was to record anew his 
fealty to the flag, sufficient time was asked to read 
the document carefully. This done, there was no 
hesitation in renewing his adhesion to the old flag. 
When this decision was announced to Commodore 
McKean in his cabin, the writer by chance looked 
up through a windsail hatchway leading to the deck 
above, and there the folds of Old Glory were se&n 
in the sunlight gracefully unfolding its beauty to 
a soft and gentle breeze. The writer was standing 
directly under it, declaring the most sacred decision 
of his life to his Commander.' 

Luck, good fortune, call it what one will, is an

element in every career; and in this respect 
Rear Admiral Schley has little complaint to 
make against the fates. With all his approved 
skill, opportunity for distinction might still 
have been lacking, — and it never has been, 
down to the culmination of his professional life 
off Santiago de Cuba, on July 3, 1898. ' The 
first square-rigged prize captured during the 
Civil War,' the ' General Parkhill/ was his 
earliest independent command, taken soon after 
the * Niagara ' began the blockade of Charleston 
on May 12, 1861. August 31 he was promoted 
to be master, and assigned to the ' Potomac,' Ms 
fellow master on that ship being the late Wil- 
liam T. Sampson. Assigned to duty under Far- 
ragut in the Gulf blockade, young Schley went 
under fire for the first time near Fort Morgan 
in Mobile Bay. 

Not long after, the intervention of European 
powers in Mexico led to the despatch to Vera 
Cruz of the ' Potomac' Eeturning, Schley was 
made lieutenant in July, 1862, and assigned as 
executive officer to the steam gunboat ' Winona,' 
where his first duty was the painful one of 
placing his superior officer under arrest for 
drunkenness. It was while in temporary com- 
mand of this ship that the following incident 
occurred, the pronoun referring to Schley, while 
Farragut is the commander-in-chief mentioned. 

'Directions were given, him to report whenever 
the signals could be read. As the orders had been 
to destroy the [Confederate] battery, it was not 
thought that the signal then flying could refer to 
us, as our duty under them was specific and dis- 
tinct. Later, however, it was learned that the sig- 
nal was intended to withdraw us from action. Not 
understanding this at the moment, the action was 
continued until every gun of the enemy had ceased 
firing. Then the ship Ufted her anchor and dropped 
down with the current to her usual position, where, 
after anchoring, the customary visit was made to 
the commander-in-chief to report the result of the 
combat. Arriving on board, the writer found on 
the quarter-deck the commander-in-chief, who, after 
responding to his salute, said: 

' "Captain, you begin early in your life to dis- 
obey orders. Did you not see the signal flying for 
near an hour to withdraw from action?" ' 

An attempt at explanation on the part of 
Lieutenant Schley was met by the statement 
that Farragut 'wanted none of this ISTelson 
business in his squadron, about not seeing sig- 
nals.' Then, — 

'The admiral invited the writer into his cabin. 
The moment the door was closed behind him there 
was an entire change in his tone and manner as 
he said smilingly, ' ' I have censured you, sir, on the 
quarter-deck for what appeared to be a disregard 
of my orders. I desire now to commend you and 
your officers and men for doing what you believed 
right under the circumstances. Do it again when- 
ever in your judgment it is necessary to carry out 
your conception of duty. Will you take a glass of 
wine, sir?" ' 

It would be both interesting and instructive 
to follow the deeds of this efficient American 



seaman step by step through the Civil War. 
But space does not permit more than to note 
that Schley was placed in command of the 
* Monongahela,' of which Admiral George 
Dewey was made executive officer soon after- 
ward, Schley then becoming navigator of the 
'Eichmond.' It was during the siege of Port 
Hudson that General Agnus and the young 
lieutenant formed that friendship which has 
been of so much importance to them both. 
After being transferred to the 'Wateree,' and 
making an extended cruise in South American 
waters as executive officer of that ship, Schley 
was transferred to the Kaval Academy as 
instructor, becoming a lieutenant-commander. 
He had much and varied experience as execu- 
tive officer of the * Benicia ' after ending his 
detail in that great school, playing an active 
part in the opening of Corea to the world, 
largely through the attack upon the forts in the 
Salee River in 1871. 

Several chapters are taken up with the story 
of the Greely relief expedition in 1884. The 
account of the preliminary arrangements made 
under Schley's supervision shows that thor- 
oughness was the first consideration, though 
celerity was none the less in mind. The com- 
ing upon the survivors, on June 22, as told in 
the book, loses nothing by its reserve. 

'The "Bear," closely followed by the "Thetis," 
arrived off the wreck camp cache about 10 p. m., 
and there found Lieutenant Greely and six of his 
comrades in a tent which the violent gale had 
blown down over the party as they lay in their 
sleeping-bags. The other eighteen of his party had 
perished, some while seeking relief toward Cape 
Isabella; some drowned while sealing; some had 
starved to death. The graves of a number were on 
a little ridge hardly two hundred feet away. 

'The condition of the survivors was desperate in 
the extreme, while the squalor of the camp as found 
was heartrending and distressing. . . . All 
those rescued were at the last limit of their endur- 
ance, as their swollen joints and great weakness 
indicated only too plainly. Life was a question of 
a few days at most to that noble band. It is a 
matter of grave doubt had the relief ships been 
delayed forty-eight hours whether a living soul 
would have been found of the party. It is even 
more certain that if their rescue had depended upon 
the whalers they could not have been reached in 
time.' 

Returning from the frozen North, Schley, 
who reached his captaincy in April, 1888, was 
appointed chief of the bureau of equipment 
and recruiting, and from that given command 
of the newly constructed war-ship ' Baltimore,' 
afterward to give so good an account of herself 
at Manila Bay. To this ship was confided the 
sorrowful honor of carrying the mortal part of 
the great inventor, John Ericsson, back to his 
native Sweden ; and the end of this mission was 
marked by distinguished courtesies extended to 
the American sailors and their ship in several 
European capitals. While at Kiel, Schley met

Captain von Diederich, who was also, it will be 
remembered, at Manila Bay. 

While commander of the ' Baltimore/ Schley 
was sent to Valparaiso during the civil war 
through which Chili was then passing, and his 
strict enforcement of neutrality seems to have 
incited the public against him. At all events, 
it was the seamen under his command who were 
selected for injury on October 16, 1891, and it 
was unquestionably Schley's diligence in col- 
lecting evidence which enabled the American 
government to adjust the difficulty with sub- 
stantial justice to everyone concerned and with- 
out incurring the hostility of the new Chilean 
authorities 

Captain Schley became inspector of the 
Third Lighthouse District upon the conclusion 
of this extended' cruise, and in that capacity 
laid the electric buoys which marked the chan- 
nels between the mouth of the Chicago River 
and the grounds of the World's Columbian 
Exposition in 1893. In September, 1895, he 
took command of the ' New York.' In connec- 
tion with that event, he makes the sensible 
observation that ' ships are worth just as much 
[as] and not a whit more than the men who 
command them.' In March, 1897, there was a 
transfer to the Lighthouse Board, followed in 
March, 1898, by the appointment to command 
of the Flying Squadron at Hampton Eoads, 
Schley's commission as commander being dated 
on February 6 of that eventful year. 

The Flying Squadron sailed on May 13, with 
Schley on his flagship, the ' Brooklyn,' and 
from that time on his conduct has been the 
subject of the most heated and embittered con- 
troversy in the annals of the American navy. 
In his statement of the facts involved, it must 
be said that Schley maintains both dignity and 
reserve, refraining from acridity of personal 
criticism to a marked degree, and presenting a 
case which his adversaries will have difficulty in 
controverting. Thirteen of the thirty-seven 
chapters of the book are given up to the account 
of his cruising and fighting off the Cuban 
shores, and to the inquiry instituted regarding 
his conduct, so that it is impossible here to 
enter into details, even were it desirable at this 
time to rake over the ashes of scandals now 
fortunately moribund. 

It is to be said in conclusion that no history 
of the war with Spain can be relied upon which 
does not take into full account the statement of 
this important and interesting work, and that 
there is every reason for the national feeling 
embodied in the stanza: 

God save us war upon the seas, 

But, If it slip, 
Send such a Chief, with men like these. 

On such a ship !

Lovers of Florence and of the Brownings will 
unite in praising the sumptuous edition de luxe 
of Mrs. Anna Benneson McMahan's volume 
entitled * Florence in the Poetry of the Brown- 
ings' (A. C. McClurg & Co.). In her editorial 
capacity, Mrs. McMahan has wisely resisted the 
temptation to write anything but a brief preface, 
letting eight of the many Florentine poems of the 
Brownings make a better basis for illustration 
than any comment, however skilful, could pos- 
sibly do. Besides 'Casa Guidi Windows' and 
*01d Pictures in Florence,' which would be the 
inevitable selections for a Florentine anthology, 
she has chosen Mrs. Browning's 'The Dance,' 
and Robert Browning's 'Fra Lippo Lippi,' 
'Andrea del Sarto,' 'The Statue and the Bust,' 
Book L of 'The Rmg and the Book,' and 'One 
Word More,' These poems are illustrated by 
sixty reproductions of Florentine art and scen- 
ery, from the excellent photographs of the 
brothers Alinari, printed in a soft tone of brown 
on Italian vellum. The picttires, which Mrs. 
McMahan has chosen individually to elucidate 
some obscure or interesting allusion of the poems, 
and collectively to let her readers see Florence 
as nearly as possible as the Brownings saw it, 
show squares, palaces and churches, quaint gate- 
way's, scenic panoramas, frescoes, statuary, and 
paintings, the very stall where 'The Book' was 
purchased, and finally Mrs. Browning's tomb and 
the Protestant cemetery where she lies buried. 
The frontispiece is of course a view of Casa 
Guidi, the home of the poets for fourteen years, 
—from whose windows Mrs. Browning heard the 
voice of young Italy singing, and returning to 
which Robert Browning, ' The Book ' in his hand, 

' stepped out on the narrow terrace built 
Over the street and opposite the church. 
And paced its lozenge brick work sprinkled cool,' 

while he watched the fateful drama of the Ring 
unfold itself again before his eyes. 'Casa Guidi 
Windows' and 'Old Pictures in Florence' gain 
most from this pictorial annotation, but the other 
poems gain, too, and conversely the Florentine 
scenes take on a new beauty and significance 
with the poems as a guide. The mechanical fea- 
tures of the book are perfect. It is elegantly 
printed on hand-made paper and bound in grey 
boards with white vellum back. The Florentine 
lily in heavy gold makes a simple and effective 
cover decoration. The volume is happily con- 
ceived and luxtmously executed, and it would be 
difficult to imagine a more beautiful gift-book 
of so enduring a type. The large-paper edition, 
to which the present notice has reference, is lim- 
ited to two himdred and fifty copies. 

One of the most beautiful and at the same time 
substantial of the season's publications is Mr. 
Edward Dillon's stout quarto on Porcelain, 
forming the second volume of 'The Connoisseur's 
Library' (Putnam). Appealing primarily to the 
collector, or at least to the connoisseur in ceram- 
ics, it is an exhaustive and scholarly treatment 
of a very definite subdivision of the general sub-

ject, and is provided with an extensive and care- 
fully tabulated bibliography and a complete 
index. On the other hand, introductory chaptei"s 
dealing with the physical and chemical nature of 
porcelain, the materials used ia its composition, 
the processes of mixing, fashioning, and firing, 
together with brief chapters on varieties of glaz- 
ing and methods of color decoration, make it pos- 
sible for the veriest tyro, if he is possessed of a 
reasonable amount of perseverance, to get both 
pleasure and profit out of Mr. Dillon 's admirable 
work. Besides popularizing the treatise, these 
introductory chapters furnish a basis for a more 
definite and technical treatment of the whole 
subject than would be possible without them, and 
prevent any tendency towards the vague general- 
izations of aesthetic criticism. For the rest, Mr. 
Dillon has chosen, as a field hitherto imexploited 
by an authoritative English work, Chinese and 
European porcelain, with especial reference to 
the nature of the paste, the glaze, and the deco- 
ration of the various wares, and above all to 
any points that throw light on the historical con- 
tinuity of the eastern and western products. 
Little attention has been bestowed upon marks, a 
branch of the subject which Mr. Dillon believes 
has already received exaggerated attention from 
collectors, to the neglect of more vital matters. 
A small collection of marks, however, is repro- 
duced from various catalogues. About half the 
book is devoted to the porcelain of China, treated 
historically and descriptively. The spreading of 
the art to neighboring countries, the importation 
of oriental wares into Europe, and the imitation 
which naturally resulted, are then briefly dis- 
cussed. Next German, French, and English por- 
celains are desciibed in detail, and a final chap- 
ter sums up the present condition of the art. 
No sort of justice can be done here to the orig- 
inality of subject-matter, or to the profound and 
at the same time clear and easy style of the 
book. It remains only to speak of the very beau- 
tiful illustrations, which are the excuse fur 
mentioning the volume at all in this connection. 
There are forty-nine plates in all, including 
reproductions both in color and photogravure, so 
that equal justice is done to the coloring and to 
the outlines and intricate patterns of the por- 
celain. The specimens reproduced are all notable, 
being for the most part from the collections in 
the British and Victoria and Albert Museums, or 
from such splendid private collections as those 
of Mr. Pierpont Morgan and Mr. David Currie. 

The collection of 'Pictures by George Frederick 
Watts' (Fox, Duffleld & Co.) is essentially what 
the title indicates, a book of pictures, with a 
brief introduction by Julia Ellsworth Ford and 
Thomas W. Lamont, who are also responsible for 
the selection and aiTangement of the illustra- 
tions. The introduction contains a short 
biography of the painter, and an appreciation of 
his art. This essa.y, which is necessarily superfi- 
cial, is unfortunately also vague. It lays par- 
ticular stress upon the symbolic and imaginative 
quality of Watts 's art, without accurately defin- 
ing the type of symbolism referred to, and upon 
his theory of the intellectual function of painting 
and its close relation to poetry without any off- 



setting statements about his technique. With the 
idea of emphasizing these same qualities, the pic- 
tures chosen for full-page reproduction are all of 
the allegorical type, and each is accompanied by 
a brief selection in vei*se or imaginative prose. 
The reproductions, consisting of platinum prints 
mounted on rough grey paper and a number of 
half-tones, are very satisfactory'. Indeed the 
luxurious character of the book makes its defec- 
tive plan all the more evident. It is to be 
deplored that Watts 's portrait work has been 
relegated to so insignificant a place in the vol- 
ume; the introduction accords it a cursory men- 
tion, and five half-tones in the text of the intro- 
duction are all the illustration it receives. The 
plan of accompanying the allegoi-ical pictures by 
literary extracts is likely to mislead, particularly 
since the selection is not carefully made. Some- 
times the passage chosen adds nothing to the 
obvious meaning of the pictures; in at least one 
or two cases it is not of sufficient poetical value 
to warrant its use in any such connection. Again, 
it is certainly a mistake to quot« Browning's 
'Eurydice to Orpheus,' with an incorrect title, as 
a commentary upon Watts 's ' Orpheus and Eury- 
dice. ' It will be remembered that Browning 
departed from the traditional details of the 
myth, giving it a new interpretation of which 
there is no suggestion in Watts 's painting. Thus, 
while the book is a beautiful art volume and will 
be of value for its pictures to students of Watts 
and modem painting, it is by no means the schol- 
arly and well proportioned volume that might 
easily have been provided within the same limits. 
Among the most attractive of the more sub- 
stantial holiday issues is Sainte-Beuve 's 'Por- 
traits of the Seventeenth Century,' selected and 
translated from the French by Miss Katherine P. 
Wormeley. The essays have been chosen from 
the 'Causeries du Lundi,' the 'Portraits de 
Femmes,' and the 'Portraits Litteraires. ' They 
have been slightly condensed by the omission of 
passages regarding long-forgotten editions, or 
discussions about style, which could not be made 
clear in English ; and in cases where two or more 
essays about the same person appeared in the 
different series, they are combined, to avoid 
repetition. Miss Wormeley 's reputation as a 
translator is already well established, so that 
it is not necessary to dwell upon the fact that 
her rendering of the essays is graceful, supple, 
and finished. The work is issued in two octavo 
volumes, handsomely bound in buckram, and 
illustrated with about thirty half-tone portraits. 
As a principle of selection, to guide a choice 
among the forty and more volumes of Sainte- 
Beuve 's critical output, none more suitable 
could have been devised than the seventeenth 
century— the golden age of France. Volume one 
contains fifteen studies of the men and women 
who adorned the court of Louis Le Grand; 
volume two opens with a history of the French 
Academy and completes the seventeenth century 
picture with a dozen critiques of the literary 
men and women of the epoch. Either volume 
may be procured separately if desired. Together, 
they form a representative collection of the best 
that Sainte-Beuve achieved— which means the

very best critical work of the nineteenth century. 
Brilliant, keen, the product of profound learning 
and minute research, they are nevertheless popu- 
lar and delightfully spontaneous in style. It is 
pleasant to be able to own a significant group of 
his essays in an edition so well-made and so 
scholarly as this one. (Putnam.) 

With the publication of 'New France and New 
England' Messrs. Ploughton, Mifflin & Co. com- 
plete their sumptuously illustrated edition of 
John Fiske's histories of the American Colonies 
from the settlement of Virginia to the adoption 
of the constitution. This ninth and last volume 
of the set is beautifully printed from new plates 
and bound uniformly with the others in polished 
red buckram. Great pains have been taken in get- 
ting together the illustrative material. Nothing 
has been admitted for the sake of mere embel- 
lishment, but the historical societies, libraries, 
and private collections, both in this country and 
in Europe, have been drawn upon for con- 
tempoi-ary material in the shape of historical pic- 
tures, portraits, original manusei'ipts, maps, 
autographs, title pages, and other documents. 
Many of these have never before been reproduced, 
and none have been utilized unless their source 
and authenticity could be established beyond 
doubt. The new volume contains more than two 
hundred plates and a number of fine photogravure 
portraits, all of the greatest interest to stu- 
dents of the period. Each plate is carefully 
described, and the present location of the origi- 
nal is indicated, in the list of illustrations. It 
is comparatively seldom that an historian is able 
to complete a cycle of work so significant and 
comprehensive as Mr. Fiske's, and we cannot be 
sufficiently grateful that he was permitted to 
round out his labors with this last volume, which, 
it will be remembered, he had barely completed 
at the time of his death. This tasteful and 
eminently scholarly illustrated edition is a fitting 
and imposing tribute to his memory. 

The barrier of obsolete speech, real or 
assumed but in either case equally effective, is 
the apology offered by Mr. Percy Mackaye for 
rendering 'The Canterbury Tales' into modern 
prose. The idea of modernization is of course 
not new, but all previous versions have been 
metrical, whereas Mr. Mackaye feels that prose, 
following as closely as possible the wording and 
construction of Chaucer, is more likely to pro- 
mote interest in the original than verse, which 
inevitably tends to direct attention to a modern 
poet. Upon this theoi-y he has made his prose 
version, carefully avoiding archaisms that are 
not easily intelligible, occasionally condensing a 
passage to satisfy propriety or relieve prolixity, 
but in the main exactly paraphrasing the text. 
It cannot be expected that such a version will 
retain the full flavor of the original, but the 
fourteenth century spirt is there, and the prose 
is, besides, easy, graceful, and rhythmical. As 
a representative selection from the 'Tales,' Mr. 
Mackaye has chosen the Prologue, the Knight's 
Tale, the Prioress 's Tale, the Nun 's Priest 's Tale, 
the Physician's Tale, and those of the Pardoner, 
the Wife of Bath, the Clerk, the Squire, the 
Franklin, and the Canon Yeoman, with enough 



of their accompanying prologues, epilogues, and 
links to make the underlying structure of the 
poem clear. Mr. Walter Appleton Clark has 
embellished the text with six colored illustra- 
tions, one of which has been \'ignetted into the 
cover. The designs are bold and quaint, and the 
coloring rich and beautiful enough to suggest 
the mellow tints of an illuminated missal. Fine 
paper and excellent typography combine with 
suitable illustration to produce a luxurious piece 
of book-making, worthy of Mr. Mackaye 's 
scholarly purpose, and likely to attract readers 
of fastidious taste. (Fox, Duffield & Co.) 

Friends of 'Uncle Remus'— and who is not a 
friend of the delightful old story-teller?— will 
welcome the rhymed version of 'The Tar Baby,* 
now offered in a handsome holiday volume 
(Appleton), containing also twenty-five other 
rhymes of IJncle Remus, all but one of which tell 
entirely new stories. Cover, end papers, page 
borders and headings show 'Brer Fox,' 'Brer 
Rabbit,' and the rest of the brotherhood in min- 
iature pen-and-ink sketches of tmusual clever- 
ness, the work of Messrs. Kemble and Frost, 
Uncle Remus 's official illustrators, who have also 
provided a generous number of full-page draw- 
ings in tint and color, reflecting perfectly the 
delicious humor of the text. About two-thirds 
of the rhymes are animal tales; the rest are 
plantation melodies and revival hymns. The 
author's note explains that the rhymed version 
of the Tar Baby is probably a good deal nearer 
to the genuine form than the prose story, which 
is the reason for re-telling it here. Mr. Harris 
also forestalls objection to the monotonous 
rhythm of Uncle Remus 's verse by calling atten- 
tion to its primitive character. Whether one pre- 
fers Uncle Remus in prose or in verse, he will 
want to have this book for its pictorial features, 
if on no other account. 

Another sheaf of Mr. Charles Dana Gibson's 
cartoons has been gathered into the usual holi- 
day folio, corresponding in size, shape, and bind- 
ing with the rest of the regular collections of 
Mr. Gibson's drawings. The new book is named 
'Every Day People,' and appears with the 
imprint of the Messrs. Scribner. We shovdd 
hardly characterize any of Mr. Gibson's people 
as strictly of the 'every day' sort, but there is 
certainly more realism, as well as more variety 
of type and situation, here than in the earlier 
drawings. The lovely Gibson girl peeps out from 
an occasional corner, and there are two or three 
real Gibson men and one Gibson Cupid ; but the 
rest of the people are the familiar and verj' 
un-ideal types of the street, the club, and the ball- 
room. We cannot exj>ect Mr. Gibson to ring 
changes indefinitely upon the sentimental-satiric 
theme with which he began his career. As his 
line of work broadens, he is getting better con- 
trol of it, and there is more humor and better 
drawing in this book than in the last two or 
three that the artist has given us. 

A book about 'The Mountains' (McClure, Phil- 
lips & Co.) is the logical successor of 'The For- 
est, ' in which Mr. Stewart Edward White proved 
himself too agreeable a camp-mate to be let off 
at the end of one trip. Like the other book, this 



374 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



is the story of a real expedition, and we are 
assured that it is all strictly true except as 
regards the Tenderfoot, who is a composite truth 
—'the apotheosis of many tenderfeet' whom Mr. 
White has known. One key to the charm of 
Mr. White's outdoor books is the practical and 
very lively directions about taking the trail with 
which he begins them. Having found out what 
to carry, how to choose your horses, how to pre- 
pare yourself for the trip by the mastery of 
such practical details as pack-hitches and swim- 
ming at your horse's tail, you are as keen for 
the long trail as were Mr. White and the two 
friends who went with him on this journey across 
the Coast Ranees of California. Then there is a 
freshness and zest about the descriptions, a 
judicious admixture of character-study and 
adventure, and a pleasant humor, which will 
recommend this book to many people who do not 
care much for the modem nature literature. We 
are not told that Mr. Femand Lungren, who has 
drawn pictures of the mountain trip, was one 
of the three in Mr. White's party, but we are 
sure that he must have been. At any rate he 
gets Mr. White's point of view exactly, and 
seizes upon the dramatic moments and the char- 
acteristic scenes for his pictures, which are a 
real addition to the annals of the trip. 

Prof. Felix E. Schelling's unique volume of 
Elizabethan sketches entitled 'The Queen's 
Progress' is described by its author as made up 
of 'some of the lighter matters that have floated 
on a stream of reading and study which has 
already carried, let it be hoped, a somewhat 
weightier freight.' The essays need no such 
apology. The easy fashion in which they deal 
with some of the more trivial aspyects of Eliza- 
bethan life presupposes a close study of its more 
essential features; and their graceful style light- 
ens, but does not conceal, their erudition. The 
title essay re-tells the familiar story of Eliza- 
beth's visit to Kenilworth as it is to be found 
in the quaint letter of Laneham, 'a dapper little 
clerk of the council chamber,' writing ostensibly 
for 'hiz friend, a citizen and merchaunt of Lon- 
don,' but really for the book-sellers. Ben Jon- 
son's walking trip to Scotland, the mad career 
of Thomas Stueley, 'Gentleman-adventurer,' a 
violent attack of theatro-mania that swept 
through the Oxford colleges in 1608, Robert 
Greene's libel of Shakespeare in 'A Groats- 
worth of Wit,' and the romantic friendship of 
Sir Philip Sidney and Fulke Greville. are some 
of the other themes. All are handled with the 
same sure touch, and bear evidence to a thorough 
understanding of the diverse interests which 
went to make up the rapid, pulsing life of the 
time. The book is issued by Messrs. Houghton, 
Mifflin & Co. in a dignified, well-made edition, 
with six fine photogravure portraits. Fastidious 
holiday buyers will appreciate its unusual charm 
of style and a corresponding distinction in 
mechanical make-up. 

Very pretty library editions of Lord Macau- 
lay's Essays, and the Tales and Poems of Edgar 
Allan Poe, are published in uniform style and 
binding, with illustrations, by Messrs. G. P. 
Putnam's Sons. Each set is in six handy-size 



volumes, printed on thin but strong paper, simply 
bound in blue cloth with gold lettering, and 
neatly boxed. The Macaulay set has frontis- 
pieces in photogravure, besides eight or nine 
half-tones in each volume, picturing persons or 
places mentioned in the text. Many of these are 
reproduced from choice old prints or engravings, 
and should be of real interest to a student of the 
essays. In the edition of Poe five volumes are 
filled with his stories, and the remaining one 
contains the poems and the significant and inter- 
esting series of essays upon 'The Poet's Art.' 
The illustrations are by Mr. F. S. Cobum, who 
has accomplished his difficult task with a fair 
degree of success, clioosing situations sufficiently 
gruesome and mysterious to be characteristic, 
and yet keeping, with possibly one or two excep- 
tions, well within the bounds of good taste. The 
absence of photogravure frontispieces in this set 
is compensated for by more elaborate head-bands 
and tail-pieces, and a greater number of illus- 
trations to the volume. The small size and 
attractive features of these editions will make 
them desirable holiday gifts. 

The story of 'Monarch, the Big Bear of Tallac' 
is Mr. Ernest Thompson Seton's contribution to 
the year's holiday literature (Scribner). As he 
takes pains to state distinctly in the foreword 
that his story is not intended to be pure 
science, but is rather an historical novel of Bear 
life, its aim being to convey the truth, but the 
truth about an unusual and composite animal, 
we do not see how it can result in any prolonga- 
tion of the recent controversy about the genuine- 
ness of Mr. Seton's writings. The story of 
'Monarch' is longer than most of his narratives, 
so that it fills out an attractive little volume, 
which has of course been illustrated and decor- 
ated by its author. The marginal drawings are 
not so clever as some of his earlier work, but 
the full-page pictures of the cub 'Jack' are 
irresistibly humorous, and the story of his evo- 
lution from an affectionate and mischievous lit- 
tle household pet into the mysterious and ruth- 
less sheepkiller of Tallac is as thrilling and 
pathetic as anything Mr. Seton has given us. 

Messrs. Adam and Charles Black's notable 
series of books illustrated in color is augmented 
this year by a volume descriptive of Westminster 
Abbey. The pictures are by Mr. John Fulley- 
love, who has already painted Oxford and the 
Holy Land for the same series; and the accom- 
panying text is by Mrs. A. Murray Smith, who 
writes entertainingly of the foundation of the 
Abbey, its evolution from a royal chapel to a 
national burial-ground, and the progressive steps 
of its building and re-building. Finally she con- 
ducts her readers through an exhaustive tour of 
the interior. Whether used as a guide-book to 
the Abbey, or by stay-at-home readers as a source 
of information, the account should prove intex'- 
esting and valuable. Mr. Fulleylove's twenty- 
one pictures show the Abbey outside and in, 
including probably every favorite and important 
view except the cloisters, and a nimiber of inter- 
esting details such as the coronation chair, 
Chaucer's tomb, and the early brasses and pic- 
turesque tombs in St. Edmund's Abbey. The

plates are artistic and daintily colored, but it is 
a question whether the choice of Westminster 
Abbey as a subject for colortype illustrations 
was a wise one. Certainly to most readers these 
pictures will seem to strike the wrong note, lay- 
ing emphasis on color— and a very individual 
color-scheme at that,— instead of upon structure, 
which is surely the memorable feature of any 
Gothic cathedral not pre-eminently distinguished 
for its windows. 

The aristocratic pussy of the bench-show has 
had her book, written for her by Miss Helen 
Winslow. Miss Agnes Repplier has given us 
the epic of the cat race, and a subtle interpreta- 
tion of its genius, in 'The Fireside Sphinx.* 
There is left the common fireside pussy, and Miss 
Sara Trueblood has now made a book about her. 
It is called 'Cats by the Way,'— that is, the cats 
you meet in morning strolls, alley cats and tramp 
cats that pro\^i by night, the cats that live at 
your friends ' houses or by your own hearth-stone, 
the good old-fashioned every-day cat that wins 
your love and sometimes your pity, and loves 
you in return. Little histories of a score or more 
of such cats make up Miss Trueblood 's volume; 
and all the incidents, the author assures us, are 
true to life. Miss Trueblood is a versatile 
genius, and the little pictures of the cats and 
cat families, scattered through the book, are also 
the woi'k of her hand. 'Cats by the Way' is 
unpretentiously bound, as befits its humble sub- 
ject, with two intelligent-looking pussies staring 
at us from the front cover. (Lippincott.) 

Dog-lovers also have their book this year, and 
a very charming one it is. Maurice Maeterlinck's 
study of 'Our Friend the Dog' (Dodd, Mead & 
Co.) is as delightful in its Avay, though not so 
unusual, as 'The Life of the Bee' by the same 
author. The particular dog that furnishes the 
occasion for the essay is a small bull-pup named 
Pelleas, who died when he was barely six months 
old. 'Polleas had a great, bulging, powerful fore- 
head, like that of Socrates or Verlaine; and, 
under a little black nose, blunt as a churlisli 
assent, a pair of large hanging and symmetrical 
chops, which made his head a sort of massive, 
obstinate, pensive and three-cornered menace.' 
According to M. Maeterlinck's interpretation, the 
dog is the only animal that really loves us. The 
horse is 'uncertain and craven'; the cow and the 
ox 'docile because for centuries they have not 
had a thought of their own'; the cat 'curses us in 
her mysterious heart'; the rest tolerate our 
dominion through fear or love of ease. But the 
dog is, and has always been, the friend of man; 
he worships him as a god and serves him as a 
slave. Just when the discussion of this thesis 
is growing a little too mystical, Pelleas brings 
it back to earth with a wag of his friendly tail. 
Mr. Paul Meylan has drawn him delightfully, 
and another artist has decorated the cover and 
pages very effectively, making the memoir of 
Pelleas altogether one of the most pleasing of 
the year's holiday productions. 

A significant contribution to the history of 
the gi-eat water-ways of America is Mr. Edgar 
Mayhew Bacon's ' Nai-ragansett Bay: Its His- 
toric and Romantic Associations' (Putnam). 



Mr. Bacon has a way of investing local history 
with a meaning and a charm which the mere 
explorer of dry-as-dust records entirely misses. 
For one thing, his point of view is broader; it 
embraces an interest in both the authentic his- 
tory and the picturesque legends of a district, 
and also in its intrinsic beauty as landscape. 
Then his work is done slowly and pleasantly, and 
consequently is accurate and weighty, without 
being labored. Finally he never loses sight of 
the human interest which, in the last analysis, 
is the redeeming feature of antiquarian studies. 
Mr. Bacon was attracted to the Narragansett 
country because of the important part played 
by its settlers 'in the development of American 
ideas and ideals,' as well as by its singularly 
romantic legends and the matchless beauty of set- 
ting which the bay affords. Readers who know 
and love the region will enjoy cruising with Mr. 
Bacon among the islands, and rambling about the 
historic old towns with their musical Indian 
names and prim Quaker traditions. Fifty pic- 
tures from sketches by the author and many 
others from photographs, together with a hand- 
some binding, give the book a holiday air. 

Mr. Walter Taylor Field's work on Rome, 
issued in two daintily proportioned volumes, 
prettily bound and copiously illustrated, may be 
called a literary guide-book to the wonders of 
the Eternal City, It is a chatty, informal 
account of a dozen rambles, suitable to be under- 
taken in as many days, and so planned as to 
give the visitor a sight of the monviments, 
churches, and galleries most worthy of his atten- 
tion. Several maps, carefully marked with 
routes and objects of interest, make the jouniey- 
ings easier of accomplishment, whether they are 
taken in reality or in imagination. For Mr. 
Field explains that in venturing to add his con- 
tribution to the vast literature that clusters 
about Rome, he has meant to steer a middle 
course between the bairrenness of the guide-book 
and the discursiveness of the essay, and so make 
a book that will be useful to the traveller in his 
sight-seeing and to the travel-lover who wishes to 
visit Rome from the vantage-ground of his own 
hearth-stone. We are sure that both classes of 
readers will enjoy these volumes, whose small 
size and full illustration make them especially 
desirable as gifts. The set forms the latest title 
in the Messrs. Page's 'Travel-Lover's Library.' 

After having obtained a bird's eye view of 
Rome from the work just mentioned, it will be 
pleasant to turn, for a more intimate study of 
the city and its people, to Mrs. Maud Howe 
Elliott's delightful volume of reminiscences, 
entitled 'Roma Beata' (Little, Brown & Co.). 
The book had its beginning in a series of letters 
which Mrs. Elliott wrote to her sister, Mrs. 
Laura Richards. From these and other letters 
and diaries, records of several summers spent 
in Rome and its environs, she has made a vol- 
ume which preserves the epistolary form and 
feeling, sparkles with humor, and runs over with 
unique and entertaining experiences such as 
could not possibly fall to the lot of the ordinary 
tourist. A few chapter titles will serve better 
than anything else to indicate the character of

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



the book: 'A Visit to Queen Margaret,' 'A 
Presentation to Leo the Thirteenth,' * Roman 
Codgers and Solitaries,' 'Black Magic and 
White,' 'Strawberries of Nemi.' A dozen illus- 
trations, fi'om Mr. Elliott's drawings and from 
photographs, add a decorative touch to this 
tempting volume. 

'The Poet's Comer' is the apt title of a port- 
folio of amusing cartoons in which Mr. Max Beer- 
bohn has hit oft' with his usual audacity the 
peculiarities of a number of celebrities ranging 
from Omar Khayyam to Mr. William Watson.. 
Mr. W. B. Yeats presenting Mr. George Moore to 
the Queen of the Fairies, Robert Browning taking 
tea with the members of the Browning Society 
(who are of course too high-minded to trouble 
with tea), Dante Gabriel Rossetti disporting him- 
self in his back garden among his pets and his 
Pre-raphaelitish friends, Samuel Taylor Coleridge 
'Table-talking,' William Shakespeare enforcing 
secrecy with one hand and holding the other 
behind him to receive a manuscript from Lord 
Bacon, and Rudyard Kipling taking 'a bloomin' 
Iday aht, on the blasted 'eath, along with Bri- 
tannia 'is gurl,' are some of the best of 'Max's' 
witty and absolutely irreverent portraits. There 
are twenty in all, printed in colors and bound 
in a board folio. (Dodd, Mead & Co.) 

It is somewhat disconcerting, even in these 
days of profuse illustration, to come upon a 
pictorial edition of Philip Gilbert Hamerton's 
'The Intellectual Life.' The method adopted 
in Messrs. Little, Brown & Co.'s new reprint is 
very simple: from the cursory literary allusions 
in which Hamerton's text abounds, nine have 
been chosen, apparently at random, and a pic- 
ture of the locality or person referred to has 
been inserted at the proper page in the text. 
This results in half-tone portraits of Byron, 
Napoleon, Da Vinci, Keats, Shelley, Scott, and 
Wordsworth, and views of Fonthill Abbey and 
Blea Tarn. We wonder a little at the lack of 
variety in the editor's choice, and would sug- 
gest that without altering the position of the 
pictures he might substitute George Sand for 
Scott, Fielding for Byron, and Kepler for Words- 
worth, thus avoiding a misleading emphasis upon 
nineteenth century poets, and securing at least 
equal relevancy to the text. It should be added 
that the new edition is well printed on paper 
of good quality, handsomely bound in red and 
gold, and contains an excellent frontispiece por- 
trait of the author in photgravure. 

'The Messages of the Masters,' Dr. Amory 
Bradford's volume of appreciations of ten of the 
world's greatest paintings, has proved popular 
enough to justify Messrs. Crowell & Co. in issu- 
ing it in a cheaper edition. This is printed from 
the same plates used in the earlier edition, but 
half-tones have been substituted for photo- 
gravures of the paintings discussed, and the book 
is neatly bound in boards with linen back. Dr. 
Bradford's method is to speak briefly of the 
aesthetic value of each painting, and then dwell 
upon its spiritual meaning. For instance, in writ- 
ing of Turner's 'Old Temeraire' his theme is 
'The Message and Ministry of the Sky.' The 
Sistine Madonna suggests 'A Christmas Medi- 



tation,' and Bume- Jones's 'Nativity' leads him 
to speak of ' The Humanity of the Divine. ' This 
sort of interpretation appeals to many readers 
who do not care for art criticism nor for 
unvarnished sermonizing. For such persons ' The 
Messages of the Masters' in its new dress will 
make a suitable and inexpensive gift. 

A certain sameness of motive runs through all 
Miss Onoto Watanna's stories, and 'The Love of 
Azalea' (Dodd, Mead & Co.) is no exception to 
this rule. There is always a piquant little 
Japanese girl— this time a sort of Cinderella 
minus a god-mother— who speaks delicious 
'pigin' English and outrages convention by 
marrying a 'foreign devil'— in this case a young 
American missionaiy. He is obliged to go to 
America, leaving her behind him, whereupon her 
cruel step-mother and a rich and wicked lover 
conspire to starve and trick her into submission 
to their desires. After a good deal of tragedy, 
the missionary comes to his wife's rescue, and 
all ends happily at last. The little story is 
prettily told, and prettily illustrated by a Japan- 
ese artist, Gazo Foudji, who has made six full- 
page illustrations in color, and a dainty series 
of marginal decorations, which are printed in 
violet to match the be-flowered cover. 

In his volume entitled 'Old Love Stories 
Retold' (Baker & Taylor Co.) Mr. Richard Le 
Gallienne has managed to make a very readable 
book out of materials either hackneyed or other- 
wise unpromising. He does not assume that all 
the phases of love which he describes are ideal, 
but only that they are all typical, each standing 
for a multitude of less famous, but no less 
genuine, exj>eriences. The prettiest story in the 
book is that of Dante and Beatrice, the most 
appealing that of Heine and Mathilde — the fat, 
stupid, merry-hearted wife, whom the unhappj'' 
poet came as near to loving as his bitter heart 
would let him love any one. Of the eight stories, 
six are already familiar to readers of 'The Cos- 
mopolitan.' They gain additional attractiveness 
from their new setting, with tinted illustrations 
and the inevitable page border,— in this case suit- 
able, graceful, and unobtrusive. The binding is 
of grey boards, with leather back. 

'The Castle Comedy,' by Mr. Thompson 
Buchanan, is a pretty little romance of the time 
of Napoleon, with an exciting plot made up of 
love and sword-play in equal parts. The scene is 
laid in England, but some of the characters are 
French, and others pretend to be. The hero is a 
nobleman disguised as a dancing master, who 
resembles Monsieur Beaucaire in quick wit, gal- 
lant address, and dare-devil recklessness. Four 
pleasing colored illustrations and appropriate 
page decorations by Miss Elizabeth Shippen 
Green, together with a delicate violet cover, con- 
tribute to make this a very tempting holiday 
volume of the lighter sort. (Harper.) 

'Love Finds a Way,' one of the late Paul 
Leicester Ford's short stories, has been made into 
a delectable holiday volume by Messrs. Dodd, 
Mead & Co. Mr. Harrison Fisher's drawings and 
Miss Margaret Armstrong's floral borders and 
cover design are the decorative features. The 
storv is not one of Mr. Ford 's best, but it is good 



1904.] 



THE DIAL 



377 



enough to make us wish that its author were still 
writing, or that his mantle had fallen upon some- 
body else. Mr. Fisher is very successful at 
depicting the sentimental 'man and girl' situa- 
tion, and his work here is as dainty and care- 
fully finished as usual. Miss Armsti'ong's 
designs are always remarkable for their grace- 
fulness and beauty of coloring, so that altogether 
this is as pretty a book as any gift-hunter need 
desire. 

Another book to which a cover designed bj' 
Miss Mai-garet Armstrong adds a touch of dis- 
tinction is 'Li'l' Gal' (Dodd, Mead & Co.), a col- 
lection of Mr. Paul Laurence Dunbar's negro 
lyrics, the title being taken from the first poem. 
Miss Armstrong has also designed page borders, 
and Mr. Leigh Richmond Miner of the Hampton 
Institute Camera Club has taken the photographs, 
which form a rich and suitable illustrative set- 
ting for the verses. This is not the first time that 
Mr. Dunbar and members of the Hampton Insti- 
tute Camera Club have co-operated in book-mak- 
ing, but their latest venture is more than ever 
deserving of praise for its harmonious, tasteful, 
and spirited transcription of negro life. 

The volimie entitled 'Japan in Pictures' 
(Warne) is aptly described by Mr. Douglas 
Sladen, author of the text and collector of the 
photographs, as being a sort of 'lantern-lecture' 
between covers. The pictures, of which there are 
about seventy-five, are grouped according to six 
topics: water-life, crops and flowers, landscape, 
temples, streets and street life, manners and 
customs; and each group is preceded by a com- 
pact and business-like introduction. By wasting 
no time on generalities, Mr. Sladen manages to 
compress a vast amount of miscellaneous and 
very entertaining information into his 'lecture,' 
and the pictures serve to fix it in the reader's 
mind. The album is just the thing with which 
to temp>er one's ignorance and correct one's 
misconceptions about the enterprising little 
island kingdom that is occupying so much of the 
world's attention at present. 

The Christmas shopper has come to depend 
upon finding something of Mr. Hamilton W. 
Mabie's ready for him each year in sumptuous 
holiday dress. This season Messrs. Dodd, Mead 
& Co. reissue an old and favorite volume, 
'Nature and Culture,' with tinted photogravures 
made from a series of very artistic photographs 
by Mr. Rudolf Eiekemeyer, Jr. These pictures 
show scenes in the woods and fields, by the sea- 
shore or the road-side, each illustrating some 
brief and vivid passage of natural description 
taken from the essays. The volume is further 
decorated by head and tail pieces somewhat 
symbolic in character. The cover design is too 
heavy for the best effect, and, we think, very 
inartistically colored. 

Among the many 'miniature' volumes which 
make such popular holiday gifts, none are 
daintier or more attractive than the 'Thumb 
Nail Series' (Century Co.). Three new volumes 
are now added,— Shakespeare's 'As You Like 
It' and 'Romeo and Juliet,' and Washington Irv- 
ing 's account of 'An Old English Christmas' 
taken from 'The Sketch Book.' As usual, the 



leather covers are embossed with symbolic 
designs done by Mrs. Blanche McManus Mans- 
field, and the author's portrait serves as a 
frontispiece for each volume. 'An Old English 
Christmas,' with its story of quaint Yule-Tide 
customs, and the peacock pie and boar's head 
trimmed Avith holly on the cover, is sure to be 
a favorite with Christmas buyers. 

Another deservedly popular seizes of bibelots 
is the 'Ariel' library of Messrs. G. P. Putnam's 
Sons, which has grown to include nearly one hun- 
dred well assorted classics. These tiny booklets 
are clearly printed on deckel-edge paper, with 
photogravure frontispieces (generally portraits), 
and are bomid in flexible red morocco, with rib- 
bon markers. The fourteen additional volumes 
of this year offer plenty of variety to the intend- 
ing purchaser. ' Castle Rackrent and Other Irish 
Tales' by Maria Edgeworth and John and 
Michael Banim appears with an introductory 
study of Irish flction and short biographical 
notices by Mr. W. B, Yeats. The 'Counter- 
blaste to Tobacco' of James I. is printed with 
the original preface by its royal author and a 
postsci-iptum account of the practical measures 
which he took to enforce his anti-tobacco cru- 
sade. Mr. George Saintsbury furnishes a bio- 
graphical note for Swift's 'Gulliver's Voyage 
to Lilliput,' and this volume is embellished with 
a number of illustrations, in addition to the cus- 
tomary frontispiece. Among the other volumes 
are Washington Irving 's 'Old Christmas,' Robert 
Browning's companion poems 'Christmas Eve' 
and ' Easter Day, ' and Fouque 's ' Undine. ' 

The trouble with Mr. Edwin F. Webster's 
book of 'Strenuous Animals' (Stokes) is that 
it is too strenuous. Mr. Webster's fables are so 
ingenious and his beasts such remarkable devia- 
tions from the order of nature that no amount 
of realism in the atmosphere of the stories will 
make them 'go down.' The bear who fed 
another bear with nitro-glycerine and then blew 
him up, the bee who got drunk on whisky and 
water and aftei-wards became a teetotaler, the 
bull-dog who emulated the swiftness of the grey- 
hound by wearing balloons, and the eagle who 
hunted its prey with field glasses, may amuse 
some readers; but the humor is too exaggerated 
to gain a wide public. Good nonsense needs a 
much lighter touch. The best story in the book 
is the one about a jumping frog, as wonderful 
in his way as his famous prototype endeared to 
us by Mark Twain. Mr. E. W. Kemble and 
'Bob' Addams have illustrated the stories. 

'Upland Pastures,' a series of nature essays 
by Miss Adeline Kjiapp, has been issued in a 
limited autograph edition by Messrs. Paul Elder 
& Co. The volume is bound in cloth and leather 
of a light green shade, and printed from type on 
Ruisdael hand-made paper. Mr. William Keith's 
painting of 'Upland Pastures,' reproduced in 
photogravure, is the frontispiece; and rubricated 
running-heads and initials set in simple borders 
constitute its only other ornamentation. The 
result is a harmonious and elegant piece of book- 
making. Miss Knapp's essays are informal jot- 
tings of things heard and seen, or thought, in 
spring-time and summer rambles. Belonging to

the reflective rather than to the dramatic type 
of nature essays, they aim to arouse an interest 
in the smaller aspects of the outdoor world, par- 
ticularly in the wonderful economy of plant life. 
They read pleasantly and easily, with a sugges- 
tion of Mr. Hamilton Mabie's method and point 
of view. 

'The Old Mastei-s and their Pictures,' a com- 
prehensive art manual for beginners by Miss 
Sarah Tytler, is issued by Messrs. Little, Brown 
& Co. in a new illustrated edition, with twenty 
good half-tone plates reproducing twenty of the 
famous paintings referred to in the text. There 
is no question that illustration helps to make a 
book of this sort attractive and illuminating, and 
Miss Tytler 's work is good enough to deserve 
whatever assistance pictorial embellishment can 
lend it. The popular character of the book, its 
ornamental binding, and the pictures, bring it 
into the cat^ory of holiday publications. 

'A Journey in Search of Christmas' (Harper) 
is the inviting title of a holiday volume by Mr. 
Owen Wister. Of course it is Lin McLean who 
takes the journey, first to Cheyenne and finally 
to Denver, where he succeeds in running down 
Christmas in lavish western fashion. The story 
is more or less made to order, but has a good 
deal of vitality about it for all that. Mr. Fred- 
eric Remington has drawn three pictures of 
Lin, making him look very much like all the 
rest of Mr. Remington's cow-boys, and has also 
made tinted pag'e decorations which furnish an 
interesting running comment on the text. The 
cover is very gaudy, — perhaps out of deference to 
Lin's taste; but accepted as symbolic of the old 
west, it need not interfere Avith the reader's 
enjoyment of a good story. 

It is eight yeai's since Mrs. Ruth McEnery 
Stuart wrote 'Sonny, a Christmas Guest,' and 
fourteen editions have been printed during the 
interval ; but the demand for that chai-ming bit of 
fiction is not yet exhausted. The reason for its 
lasting popularity is not far to seek; 'Sonny' is 
full of real humor, delicate, but irresistible; you 
laugh because you cannot help it, and no matter 
how many times you have read the story, its 
freshness and sweetness still make their appeal. 
The latest edition of the book, published by the 
Century Co., is illustrated by Miss Fanny Y. 
Cory, just the right person to vmderstand Sonny 
and to depict him and his family in an original 
and entertaining way. There are fourteen illus- 
trations, besides a decorated initial for each chap- 
ter. 

Messrs. Crowell & Co.'s 'Luxembourg Library' 
is intended to furnish reprints of classic novels, 
which shall be durable and attractive and yet not 
too expensive to be within reach of a moder- 
ately filled purse. This purpose it fulfils very 
acceptably. The cloth bindings are simply 
and prettily ornamented, the typography clear, 
the paper of fair quality, and the illustrations in 
several cases of unusual interest and merit. The 
five volumes lately issued in this pleasing and 
inexpensive dress are Jane Austen's 'Pride and 
Prejudice,' with seventeen clever drawings in pen 
and ink; William Ware's 'Zenobia,' with the 
same number of photographs of the ruins of 



Palmyra; Smollett's translation of 'Gil Bias,' 
with illustrations taken from the French text; 
Charles Lever's 'Harry Lorrequer' with repro- 
ductions of the drawings by 'Phiz' which 
appeared in the first edition; and Bulwer-Lyt- 
ton's 'Rienzi.' The present day flood of fiction 
is resulting in a neglect of many stories better 
worth while than some of the best selling books 
of the week or month. An attractive series of 
reprints, like those of the 'Luxembourg' series, 
that helps to turn the tide and sends us back 
to make or renew acquaintance with old favorites, 
is of real service to the cause of good literature. 

It was a happy thought of the A. Wessels Co. 
to publish the 'Maximes' of La Rochefoucauld 
in an edition with French and English versions 
on opposite pages. It is entirely a matter of 
taste whether one enjoys the hard, worldly wis- 
dom of the 'Maximes,'— though Sainte-Beuve 
has said that there are moments in life when 
everybody gloats over them. But however 
strongly one may dissent from their cynical esti- 
mates of humanity, one cannot but admire their 
lively precision and courteous, measured sim- 
plicity of expression. They ought to be re-read 
occasionally, if only as an antidote for exaggera- 
tion; and for that purpose the present reprint is 
very suitable. Print and paper are good, the 
binding is pretty and durable, the end-papers 
appropriately decorated with thistles. The Eng- 
lish version of the maxims follows the French 
closely, and preser\'es its cautious suavity very 
well. 

'A good cheer book is the best year book,'— so 
runs the motto with which the preface to Miss M. 
Allette Ayer's volume of 'Daily Cheer' begins; 
and we shall not be inclined to question the 
truth of the couplet. This particular 'Good 
Cheer' book is made tip very much in the usual 
way, with a page of well-chosen extracts for each 
day in the year. The selections are all bright 
and cheerful, but there is plenty of variety in 
length, subject-matter, style, and authorship. 
The quotations on a page range in number from 
one to ten, but in every case a single thought 
runs through each day's reading and unifies it. 
The pages of briefer quotations are particularly 
interesting, because of the novelty of finding 
such diverse authors as Shakespeare, Mrs. Mar- 
garet Sangster, Robert Browning, 'Mrs. Wiggs,' 
and William Cullen Bryant in symposivun upon 
the same subject. The chaste binding and taste- 
ful arrangement of the book will add materially 
to its value for the holiday purchaser. (Lee & 
Shepard.) 

Friends of Dr. Theodore Cuyler are l^on, 
and they will all welcome the appearance of 
'Our Christmas Tides' (Baker & Taylor Co.), 
selected and in part written by him. The bind- 
ing shows an elaborate desig-n in green and gold, 
and the book is handsomely printed on toned 
laid paper, with appropriate marginal decora- 
tions and end papers. Several photographs, 
including a frontispiece portrait of Dr. Cuyler 
taken in 1903, serve as illustrations. The selec- 
tions include both verse and prose, harking back 
to old favorites like 'It Came upon the Midnight 
Clear' and Phillips Brooks's beautiful Christmas

hymn, and treating such diverse phases of the 
theme as Christmas customs in many lands, 
I'eminiscences of a day in modern Bethlehem, and 
suggestions about true Christmas giving. In 
short, the booklet is an unusually pleasing 
example of a familiar type, for which there seems 
to be a perennial demand. 

'Christmas Eve on Lonesome' (Scribner) is the 
title story in a new volume by Mr. John Fox, Jr. 
Mr. Fox has kept closely within his chosen field, 
— the lawless and primitive life of the Kentucky 
mountaineer; and the feud is naturally the 
pivotal pK)int of most of the stories. However, 
the situations and types of character are so 
varied that there is no monotony about the book. 
The feud, as Mr. Fox portrays it, has its pos- 
sibilities of humor as Avell as of pathos and bitter 
tragedy, and the strange nature of the moun- 
taineer has its kindlier and more generous side; 
so the stories are cheerful reading. Of the five 
in the book, one besides the first has a Christmas 
theme, and the gay scarlet cover and eight illus- 
trations in color emphasize the holiday flavor. 

Mr. Will Carleton 's ever popular ' Over the Hill 
to the Poor-House,' and its companion piece 
'Over the Hill from the Poor-House,' have been 
detached from the other 'Farm Ballads' and 
made into a handsome Christmas book (Harper), 
with tinted illustrations and page decorations 
by Mr. W. E. Mears, and an interesting preface 
by the author. In this preface Mr. Carleton 
expresses becoming wonder over the interest 
that these two simple poems have aroused, and 
then gives an unaffected little history of the good 
he knows they have done and of the convincing 
proofs he has had that the critics who sneered at 
the tmreality of his work were quite in the wrong. 

'Business' is the terse and somewhat anom- 
alous title of a small collection of slangy, cynical, 
and more or less witty epigrams, intended to 
embody the sordid philosophy of the modem bus- 
iness world in a form that will make it seem 
less sordid, at least for the moment. Mr. L. de 
V. Matthewman is responsible for the aphorisms, 
and Mr. Tom Fleming for the pictures. 'The 
sureness of a sure thing is for the other man'; 
'Do something if you must: do somebody if you 
can'; 'Incessant work tells— on the worker'; 
'Opportunity knocks once at every man's door, 
but generally makes sure that he is not at home ' ; 
'Whether the bull or the bear wins, it is a cold 
day for the lamb';— these will serve as samples 
of the quality of Mr. Matthewman's epigrams, 
which gain considerably in point from Mr. Flem- 
ing's accompanying drawings. (Lippincott.) 

'Petals of Love for Thee' (Dodge Publishing 
Co.) is the title of a booklet of lyrics by Edith 
Hall Orthwein. It is lavishly decorated with 
floral designs printed in glaring colors, and hav- 
ing, except in one or two cases, very little con- 
nection with the text. The poems are very faulty 
in technique, and are disfigured by unfortunate 
mannerisms. Altogether the volume belongs to a 
type of 'Holiday book' which is fast being super- 
seded by finer workmanship and more literary 
value. 



Books for the Youxg. 
I. 



The numerous volumes of the current season 
especially addressed to children exhibit in the main 
very much the same tendencies and standards as we 
have noted in former years. There is not as much 
of war and turmoil as there was a few years ago, 
and the gigantic struggle in Asia is almost unre- 
flected here — possibly because so little is really 
known of the details. Books which make an 
appeal limited to boys and girls within certain 
narrow age limits seem to be on the increase. 
Books of adventure show no diminution in number, 
whether the adventure be connected with authentic 
history or not; but there is a marked falling off in 
the number of stories dealing with historical epi- 
sodes not distinctly modern. There seems to be 
a decrease, also, in the way of older books of 
ascertained worth; and at the other extreme of 
the literary scale there is a similar diminution 
as regards picture books with jingles showing an 
original turn of thought. On the whole, it is 
probably safe to say that the most encouraging 
feature in the children's books of the present sea- 
son is the increasing depth of thought and serious- 
ness of purpose displayed — though this is an 
impression rather than a statement susceptible of 
definite proof. Noticeable, also, is a steadily grow- 
ing skill in the handling of material, whether 
historical or human. But marked ability or strik- 
ing originality is not much in evidence. 
^, . By all odds the most striking child 's 

inVeTforZ. ^?«^ ^^ the season is the new edition 
of Eugene Field's 'Poems of Child- 
hood' (Scribner), with illustrations in color by 
Mr. Maxfield Parrish. There is a delicacy of senti- 
ment and touch about these delightful illustrations 
that not only interprets the text, but gives it a 
refinement it did not possess before. The poems 
included in the volume are chosen from a wider 
range than heretofore, and on every account the 
book is one to cherish. — Mr. T. H. Robinson has 
performed a similar service for Charles Kingsley's 
'The Heroes' (Dutton), although his illustrations, 
in color and black-and-white, lack the marked dis- 
tinction of Mr. Parrish 's work. But the edition 
is none the less a worthy treatment of a worthy 
book. — A pleasant revival of the forgotten work 
of a forgotten author, certain to meet with 
approval, is the new edition of Frances Browne's 
'Granny's Wonderful Chair' (McClure, Phillips & 
Co.). Mrs. Frances Hodgson Burnett knew and 
loved the book as a child, but later on it passed 
from her, and only recently did she chance upon 
a copy. It had meant so much to her that she 
has felt impelled to set forth the fact in a really 
delicious preface to the present reprint which she 
calls 'The Lost Fairy Book,' a better bit of writ- 
ing, possibly, than anything else in the volume. — 
There is, almost inevitably one might say, a new 
edition this season of Lewis Carroll's 'Alice's 
Adventures in Wonderland' (Stokes), for which 
Mr. M. L. Kirk has prepared twelve fuU-pago 
pictures in color. Sir John Tenniel's original 
illustrations are also included, and Mr. Kirk has 
retained the spirit of these in his own drawings. 
Consequently the volume has a seemly congruity 
and reverence for tradition not to be found in 
other editions of the classic. — Two more of Louisa 
M. Alcott's books are republished, with admirable 
pictures by Miss Harriet Roosevelt Richards, in 
Messrs. Little, Brown & Co.'s new edition of that 
sterling author. 'Eight Cousins; or, The Aunt-.

Hill' and 'Rose in Bloom' are the titles of this 
year's additions, and in all respects the volumes 
are fully up to the high standard set by their 
predecessors. — 'Fairy Tales by Dumas' (Stokes) 
is the prosaic title chosen for the volume con- 
taining Mr. Harry A. Spurr's translation of the 
Aramis story, 'When Pierrot Was Young,' and 
'The Countess Bertha's Honey Feast.' Mr. Harry 
Eoundtree's illustrations show a fine appreciation 
of the significance of the stories, and the book 
makes one wish that the delicious imagination 
of Dumas might have expressed itself more fre- 
quently in works of the kind. — Paul de Musset 'a 
'Mr. Wind and Madam Rain,' as translated years 
ago by Miss Emily Makepeace and illustrated by 
Charles Bennett, is now reproduced in handsome 
form by the Messrs. Putnam. The fanciful supersti- 
tions of the Breton peasantry and an interpolated 
puppet show will be recalled as making up the 
groundwork of this delightful tale. — What is 
often characterized as the Italian 'Alice in Won- 
derland' has been rendered into English by Mr. 
Walter Samuel Cramp from the original of Carlo 
Collodi, under the title of 'The Adventures of 
Pinocchio' (Ginn). The titular hero is a wooden 
marionette, and Mr. Charles Copeland has pictured 
him in complete accordance with the spirit of the 
text. — ' Red Cap Tales, Stolen from the Treasure 
Chest of the Wizard of the North, Which Theft 
is Humbly Acknowledged by S. R. Crockett' is 
the wording on the title page of an attractive 
book (Macmillan), with illustrations in color by 
Mr. Simon Harmon Vedder. Mr. Crockett has 
taken a number of stories dealing with gnomes 
and fairies from five of the Waverley novels, sim- 
plified them somewhat by rewriting with a juvenile 
audience in view, and left his readers to obtain 
the effect of the new grouping. — In a manner 
somewhat analogous, Mr. Frederic Lawrence 
Knowles has produced 'The Story of Little Paul' 
and 'The Story of Little Peter' (Estes), as new 
volumes in the 'Famous Children of Literature' 
series. Dickens's 'Dombey and Son' provides the 
material for the former book, and Captain Mar- 
ryat's 'Peter Simple' for the latter. Both are 
examples of what might be called predigested 
literature. — A new version of the old story of the 
Argonauts has been made by Prof. D. O. S. Lowell, 
of the Roxbury Latin School, and published under 
the title of 'Jason's Quest' (Lee & Shepard), with 
illustrations by Mr. C. W. Reed. The book is 
deserving of praise in every respect. 

Of books dealing with American his- 

owti uii y. g^g^ .^ point of time being Mr. Heze- 
kiah Butterworth 's 'Little Metacomet' (Crowell). 
This account of the son of Philip, last of the Wam- 
panoags, is for quite small children. Exiled by 
the English after his father's death at Mount 
Hope, the short history of the little prince is told 
in its relations to a family of white children which 
he befriended. — Mrs. Mary P. Wells Smith takes up 
a well known episode in the French and Indian 
War of two centuries ago in 'The Boy Captive of 
Old Deerfield' (Little, Brown & Co.). Her story is 
written with painstaking intention to teach the 
comfortable children of to-day something of the 
sufferings of their predecessors. — The southern 
colonies come in for somewhat belated treatment 
in two books by Miss Annie M. Barnes: 'A Lass 
of Dorchester,' in which the scene is laid in the 
Carolinas in 1702, and 'The Laurel Token: A 
Story of the Yamassee Uprising,' dealing with the 
plantation at Goose Creek in 1714. There is wide 
field for the investigator here, and Miss Barnes has 
made good use of her manifest opportunities. 



Both books are published by Messrs. Lee & Shep- 
ard. — The fourth volume of Mr. Edward Strate- 
meyer's 'Colonial Series' is called 'On the Trail 
of Pontiac; or,The Pioneer Boys of the Ohio' (Lee 
& Shepard), and brings the history down to the 
last French and Indian war in the eighteenth cen- 
tury. Characters from previous books in the series 
reappear here, and the treatment of the Indian 
tribes is more humane than the settlers themselves 
were accustomed to accord them. — Revolutionary 
times in their inception find mention episodically 
in Miss Helen M. Cleveland's 'Stories of Brave Old 
Times: Some Pen Pictures of Scenes Which Took 
Place Previous to, or Connected with, the Ameri- 
can Revolution' (Lee & Shepard). The short stories 
are picturesque and full of the turmoil of the times, 
leaving a curious sense of the inadequacy of the 
struggle to maintain the liberties so painfully 
acquired. Photographs of the localities mentioned 
and numerous pen drawings illustrate the book. — 
Mr. James Otis, one of the best of American writ- 
ers on such topics, presents a graphic picture of 
New York just after the declaration of indepen- 
dence in 'Dorothy's Spy' (Crowell). A small 
patriot and a British spy lend interest to the story, 
and Mr. Clyde O. DeLand's illustrations are bet- 
ter than the average. — Mr. Everett T. Tomlinson 
makes one of Washington's couriers the prota- 
gonist in 'The Rider of the Black Horse' 
(Houghton), involves a charming girl in the hero's 
fortunes, sets a villainous 'Cowboy' against them 
both after they have jointly tricked him, and makes 
of it all a very good story indeed, one of the best 
he has ever written. — Of the same year, 1777, with 
the scene in Vermont rather than New York, is 
Mr. James Otis's 'The Minute Boys of the Green 
Mountains' (Estes). Two boys of sixteen and an 
old hunter of the Leatherstocking type work 
together for independence in an entirely whole- 
hearted manner. — From the battle-field of Hohen- 
linden to the consummation of the Louisiana Pur- 
chase is the period covered by Mr. William C. 
Sprague's 'The Boy Courier of Napoleon' (Lee & 
Shepard). There is plenty of excitement in the 
book, which closes with the boy's restoration to the 
arms of his father in the new world. — Miss Amanda 
M, Douglas's 'A Little Girl in Old Chicago,' 
(Dodd, Mead & Co.), opens in the year 1812, though 
the story is carried down past the time of the Col- 
umbian Exposition. It is an interesting story of 
wonderful development and accomplishment. — Mr. 
Thomas J. L. McManus, whose younger days were 
passed near Harper's Ferry, was one of those who 
were actually in the mountain schoolhouse at the 
time of its capture. He has written, in 'The Boy 
and the Outlaw' (Grafton Press), an impressive 
account of John Brown's raid and the weeks imme- 
diately thereafter. The book is illustrated in color. 
— The very opening of the Civil War, while the 
Confederates were attempting to capture President 
Lincoln and his cabinet, is the period of Mr. Wil- 
liam O. Stoddard's 'Long Bridge Boys' (Lothrop), 
and the youthful hero is made to save the govern- 
ment by a clever bit of detective work. — ' The 
Three Prisoners' (Barnes) by Mr. W. H. Shelton, 
is also a Civil War story, covering a longer period 
of time than the book just named, and detailing the 
engrossing particulars of one of the narrowest of 
escapes. — 'Daniel Webster for Young Americans' 
(Little, Brown & Co.) is the title of a volume 
edited, with an introduction and notes, by Prof. 
Charles F. Richardson. A succinct biography sym- 
pathetically prepared, a collection of Webster's 
greatest speeches, and Edwin P. Whipple's essay 
on 'Webster as a Master of English Style' make 
up the contents. There are a number of pertinent

portraits and other pictures. — ' The American 
Boy's Life of Theodore Eoosevelt' (Lee & Shep- 
ard) depends for its interest rather upon the spec- 
tacular than the significant episodes in the career 
of the President of the United States. It is writ- 
ten by Mr. Edward Stratemeyer, and is illus- 
trated.

'The Story of Rolf and the Vikmg s 
Bow' (Little, Brown & Co.), and the spirit of the 
Sagas is alive in the work. The period is the 
one of transition between the old religion and the 
new Christianity, and elements of both appear 
through the narrative. The pictures, by Mr. 
Bernard J. Rosenmeyer, are drawn with spirit and 
historical fidelity. — 'The Crusaders: A Story of the 
War for the Holy Sepulchre' (Macmillan) is a 
well considered work by the Rev. A. J. Church, 
with illustrations in color by Mr. George Morrow. 
The tale is told in episodes, so to speak, the accent 
being laid on the more important crusades and 
upon the significant incidents in each. — Mr. Paul 
Creswick describes a single one of these gigantic 
movements for the Christianization of the Holy 
Land in his book called 'With Richard the Fear- 
less: A Tale of the Red Crusaae' (Button). Both 
the text and colored illustrations by Mr. H. Crocket 
provide a vivid picture of the heroic side of the 
third crusade. — It is a baby princess, Henrietta of 
England, with whom the interests of the heroine of 
'Elinor Arden, Royalist' (Century Co.) become 
finally identified. The whole story, as told by Mrs. 
Mary Constance Du Bois, is interesting and even 
exciting. — Four volumes of 'Life Stories for 
Young People' (McClurg) have been translated 
from the German by Mr. George P. Upton, form- 
ing the nucleus for a series of books of scholarly 
value addressed directly to young folk. Of the 
volumes now ready, 'Ludwig von Beethoven' and 
'Mozart's Youth' are by Franz Hoffman, 'The 
Maid of Orleans' by Friedrich Henning, and 'Wil- 
liam Tell' by Ferdinand Schmidt. With the excep- 
tion of the book about Mozart, which carries the 
account only through his fifteenth year, the biog- 
raphies are complete, though the emphasis is 
placed as much as possible on the making of the 
adult in the child. Rare old pictures are repro- 
duced for the illustrations in each case. — Full 
attention has been paid to historical accuracy by 
Mr. Herbert Strang in 'The Light Brigade in 
Spain; or. The Last Fight of Sir John Moore' 
(Putnam), as the preface by Lieutenant-Colonel 
Willoughby Verner bears witness. It is a book of 
the Henty sort, with a boyish hero, and is full of 
vigor and action. — The latest volume in the series 
of 'Famous Battles of the 19th Century' (Wessels) 
carries the narrative from 1815 to 1860. The 
Alamo, Buena Vista, and Chapultepec are of con- 
cern to Americans; the other battles described are 
mainly European. The accounts are from various 
well-known hands, and the entire work is under 
the editorship of Mr. Charles Welsh. 

Adventure in ^""1'^,^, ""^ adventure based only inci- 
many lands. dentally upon historical events are 
never devoid in the nature of things 
of a certain sort of sensationalism, though there is 
a great difference in both the quality and quantity 
of the sensations involved as well as of veritable 
fact. 'The Blue Dragon: A Story of Recent 
Adventures in China' (Harper), by Mr. Kirk Mun- 
roe, is a combination of sensational romantic inci- 
dent with historical or biographical incident, cul- 
minating in the relief of the beleaguered legations 
in Peking during the Boxer uprising. It is note- 



worthy for its sympathy with the yellow race, 
although quite devoid of prejudice in favor of the 
Chinese. — Of another sort is Mr. E. P. Weaver's 
'The Search' (Barnes), in which a courageous 
English boy travels from London to western New 
York and Pennsylvania in the eighteenth century to 
effect a gallant rescue described at the close of 
the narrative. It presents a romantic picture of 
the time and locality, yet is uncomplicated by his- 
torical characters. — 'In Search of the Okapi: A 
Story of Adventure in Central Africa' (McClurg) 
discloses the condition of affairs in the Congo 
State, besides presenting an account of the fauna 
and flora of the Congo forests, and the customs of 
native negroes. It is a story of the wanderings of 
a naturalist and his two youthful companions, one 
of these latter a seeker after his father, long a 
captive to a native tribe. — Almost purely imagi- 
native is Mr. Howard R. Garis's 'Isle of Black 
Fire' (Lippincott), in which a shipload of men 
and boys set out to bring home a great piece of 
rich radium ore from one of the islands of the sea. 
— A story of more sentimental interest is Miss 
Mary Bourchier Safford's 'The Wandering Twins: 
A Story of Labrador' (McClurg). In this almost 
unknown corner of the world a boy and girl are set 
down to seek their father. A thrilling rescue from 
the perils of the frozen North ends the tale. — 
Labrador is also the scene of Mr. George E. 
Walsh's 'The Mysterious Beacon Light: The 
Adventures of Four Boys in Labrador' (Little,. 
Brown & Co.). The boys find a wreck with a val- 
uable cargo, have difficulties with icebergs, and 
are otherwise fully occupied during their absence 
from a comfortable home. — 'David Chester's Motto, 
"Honour Bright": A Boy's Adventures at School 
and Sea' (Warne) is by Mr. H. Escott-Inman, and 
possesses a variety of interests arising from the 
circumstance of an honest lad's falling under sus- 
picion of criminal transactions. — 'Jack in the Rock- 
ies; or, A Boy's Adventures with a Pack Train '^ 
(Stokes), by Mr. George B. Grinnell, is a straight- 
forward account of the wonders of the Yellow- 
stone National Park, of Indians, and of hunting 
of various sorts, written by one who knows from 
extended experience exactly what he is talking 
about. — Though in a part of the country very near 
settled civilization, the boys in 'The Island Camp; 
or. The Young Hunters of Lakeport' (Barnes) 
hunt bears and wolves, and find much adventure of 
other sorts. The book is by Captain Ralph Bone- 
hill (Mr. Edward Stratemeyer). 

The fighting of sailors rather than 
soldiers, and the deeds of those that 
go down into the sea in ships, occupy 
the attention of various authors. The list of books 
in this field may well be headed by Dr. Edward 
Everett Hale's 'Stories of Discovery as Told by 
Discoverers' and 'Stories of Adventure as Told by 
Adventurers' (Little, Brown & Co.), now reprinted 
in attractive form after several decades of useful- 
ness. — Of the same sort, but with the attention 
given to marauding rather than to the uses of 
peace, is Miss Jessie Peabody Frothingham 's 'Sea- 
Wolves of Seven Shores' (Scribner). From the 
Mediterranean to the Gulf of Mexico, and from the 
Barbary States to North America, is the range of 
this most interesting and exciting book. — The last 
of the Henty books, 'By Conduct and Courage: A 
Story of Nelson's Days' (Scribner), will be laid 
down with a feeling of real regret that so notable 
a figure in the development of children's stories 
should hereafter be silent. The book is as good as 
most of its predecessors, although both its brevity 
and abrupt close lead to the supposition that, whil*

complete as far as it goes, it was intended to go 
further, — Nelson reappears in the concluding chap- 
ters of 'His Majesty's Sloop Diamond Eock' 
(Houghton), by Mr. H. S. Huntington, an unusu- 
ally good story. The scene is laid upon a rocky 
islet near Martinique, which the British seized dur- 
ing the Napoleonic struggles of 1802-3, and armed, 
manned, and commissioned as a sloop-of-war. It 
was at last surrendered after a desperate defense 
against an overwhelming force; but the boy-hero 
is permitted to escape as the bearer of despatches 
to Nelson regarding the coming of Villaneuve 's 
fleet. — The international interest now growing so 
common is very evident in Mr. F. H. Costello 's 
'Nelson's Yankee Boy: The Adventures of a 
Plucky Young New Englander at Trafalgar and 
Elsewhere, and Later in the War of 1812' (Holt). 
The hero is impressed into the British service as a 
mere lad, and after doing faithful duty there he 
ends his naval career on the privateer 'Decatur' 
after its gallant capture of the 'Dominica,' The 
thrilling pictures are by Mr. W. H. Dunton, and 
the book is altogether an exciting one. — With the 
interest divided between a whaler, a trading vessel, 
and that heroic warship, the 'Essex,' Mr. Cyrus 
Townsend Brady's 'A Midshipman in the Pacific' 
(Scribner) is a volume teeming with action, some 
of it savoring of exaggeration, A midshipman is 
impressed unwillingly into the service of a British 
whaling vessel. Shipwrecked in mid-ocean, he and 
a companion are rescued by the ship sent by Astor 
to the mouth of the Columbia. At the end. of the 
voyage the lad is captured by Indians, but con- 
trives to escape in time to join Porter, and is with 
the latter when the 'Essex' is conquered after its 
valiant defence. — Mrs. Mary J. Safford has trans- 
lated and adapted 'Prince Henry's Sailor Boy' 
(Holt) from the German of Otto von Bruneck. 
The book sets forth the life and adventures of a 
youthful protege of an imperial personage, who 
eventually wins his way to a commission after 
doing gallant service in the African Hinterland. It 
is a well written and interesting story. 

Perhaps the most interesting of the 
especHally season's stories for boys is told by 

the popular Japanese author, Gensai 
Murai, and his book, translated by Tasao Yoshida, 
is named 'Kibun Daizin; or. From Shark-Boy to 
Merchant Prince' (Century Co.). The story is a 
true one, dating back to the seventeenth century, 
and showing that at that time there was a stronger 
resemblance between Japanese ideas of success and 
those current in America to-day than is generally 
supposed. But the hero is animated by the pre- 
cepts of a worthy religion to an extent not common 
in the Occident, and his reputation is good in more 
than the commercial sense. — It can hardly be said 
that anything in the way of invention is improb- 
able at this time, so that Mr. Alvah Milton Kerr's 
'Two Young Inventors: The Story of the Flying 
Boat' (Lee & Shepard) avoids to a considerable 
extent the criticism of improbability. A cyclonu 
and a forest fire are incidents in the tale, which 
ends in the production of a boat suitable for either 
air or water. — A wholesome account of the life 
led by a New York lad while in the country for 
his health is contained in 'The White Crystals' 
{Little, Brown & Co.), the title being derived from 
the discovery of salt on the farm where the lad is 
staying with his uncle and cousin. — 'Jack Ten- 
field's Star: A Story for Boys and Some Girls' 
(Lee & Shepard) is by Miss 'Martha James, and 
deals with the problem of an orphaned lad who 
is left penniless by his father's death and has to 
make his own way. He is sturdy, manly, and self- 



reliant, and at the end wins a place in the world. 
— It would be hard to imagine a boy who begins 
life at a greater disadvantage than the small hero 
of Mr. William Wallace Cooke's 'Wilby's Dan' 
(Dodd), for he has a miser for a grandfather, u 
criminal for a father, and a poor-house charge for a 
sister. But he manages to get ahead, once he finds 
kindly treatment. — There is an account of the 
breaking-up of the reign of terror in San Francisco 
in 'The Young Vigilantes: A Story of California 
Life in the Fifties' (Lee & Shepard) which is well 
worth reading, as Colonel Samuel Adams Drake 
tells it. Two Boston lads who were not satisfied 
with remaining at home are the heroes. — Two lads 
in the Pennsylvania mountains stumble upon an 
Indian treasure mound in Mr. Henry Edward 
Rood's 'In Camp at Bear Pond' (Harper). In addi- 
tion to this great event, there is full record of the 
usual fun boys have when they are in the open. — 
'Larry the Wanderer; or. The Else of a Nobody' 
(Lee & Shepard) depends for its climax upon the 
familiar device of restoration to a long-lost family 
of means and respectability, but in this case not 
until the boy had been able to show of what good 
stuff he was made. It is written by Mr. Edward 
Stratemeyer. — Miss Helen Dawes Brown, in ' A 
Book of Little Boys' (Houghton), has depictea 
fourteen episodes of life as the small boy lives it. 
All are good, and one, 'The Luck of Havin' Broth- 
ers,' is notable. — A story the sadness of which is 
relieved by its happy conclusion is Miss Etheldred 
B. Barry's -'What Paul Did' (Estes). A crippled 
child, son to a widowed father, develops great 
talent as a draughtsman. Just when everything 
has grown darkest, the sky brightens and the world 
becomes gay again. It is a pretty little tale, full 
of humanity and encouragement.

that can keep minds active and alert, and hanas 
anu bodies busy and healthy, in the way of play 
and interesting work is included, with illustrations 
to make the explicit directions still more compre- 
hensible. — Without touching on the side of profit- 
yielding occupations, and with more stress laid upon 
the social side of life, Mrs. Burton Kingsland's 
'The Book of Indoor and Outdoor Games, with 
Suggestions for Entertainments' (Doubleday) will 
prove a real treasure for those lacking in inven- 
tion, and will bring delight to many a dull or 
rainy day.— In ' Nathalie 's Sister : The Last of the 
McAlister Eecords' (Little, Brown & Co.), we bid 
farewell to the charming family that Miss Anna 
Chapin Eay has permitted us to number among our 
acquaintance. It is Peggy Arterburn who finds 
delineation here, and she develops into a fine young 
woman, after exhibiting some asperities. The excel- 
lent illustrations are by Mrs, Alice Barber Ste- 
phens. — A young girl, with a mother failing in 
health and a father none too successful in business, 
has won a scholarship at Wellesley. Duty leads her 
to give up her dearest ambition, and she goes 
instead to the 'College of Life,' where she learns 
the secret of noble womanhood from Professors 
Poverty and Cheerfulness. This is the theme of 
Miss Evelyn Eaymond's 'An Honor Girl' (Lee & 
Shepard.).— A delightful book for girls is Mrs. 
Ellen Douglas Delaud's 'Josephine' (Harper), m 
which two orphaned sisters, the elder sixteen, come 
from the northwestern corner of the United States 
to the home of their widowed uncle near Boston, 
there to meet an assortment of cousins, all boys.

THE DTAL

How the elder girl wins her way to esteem is 
charmingly told, with a little secondary romance 
for good measure. — Good nature, the ability to 
take reasonable care of one's self, sympathy for 
others, mental alertness, and a number of other 
charming things that characterize American girls 
at their best, appear in Mrs. A. D. T. Whitney's 
admirable collection of tales woven together into 
a collective whole, entitled 'Biddy's Episodes' 
(Houghton). — How a young girl of good family, 
comfortable means, glowing health, and more than 
ordinary beauty of mind and body occupies her 
time at home after the school days are over is told 
by Miss Amy Brooks in 'Bandy's Good Times' (Lee 
•& Shepard). — Character development through mar- 
riage and illness is the theme of Miss Amanda M. 
Douglas's 'Honor Sherburne' (Dodd), the elev- 
enth volume of a noteworthy series. The heroine is 
married at the opening of the story, settles in 
Washington with her husband, overcomes a serious 
paralytic attack, and in the end brings about a 
wedding for a dear girl. — Six clever girls, a maiden 
aunt, and a widowed father, go to make up the 
family depicted in the pages of Miss Miriam 
JMichelson 's 'The Madigans' (Century Co.). The 
scene is laid in Butte, Montana, and in spite of 
surroundings felt to be exotic by those living far- 
ther East, there is enough of human nature in the 
book to make its interest universal. — Kestoration 
to a wealthy and devoted mother is the point upon 
which Miss Faith Bickford's story of 'Gloria' 
(Estes) turns. The child is of Portuguese birth, 
and has been brought up among her compatriots in 
.a fishing village on Cape Cod. — Miss Carolyn Wells 
shows even more humor than usual in her treat- 
ment of the small girl who is the protagonist in 
'The Staying Guest' (Century Co.). The supposed 
niece of two exceedingly prim maiden ladies comes 
to live with them, against their wish at first, but 
with entire willingness at the end. The situations 
are delicious. — 'Irma and Nap: A Story for 
Younger Girls' (Little, Brown & Co.) is by Miss 
Helen Leah Eeed, with pictures by Miss Clara E. 
Atwood. Irma is a little girl. Nap a little dog, and 
the two work out their small salvations with a large 
family about them, Irma's girl friends playing no 
inconsiderable part in the narrative. — * Pansy ' 
(Mrs. G. E, Alden) takes the small heroine of 
'Doris Farrand's Vocation' (Lothrop) through the 
-critical portion of her life after her father dies, 
and brings her out worthy of the scriptural motto 
he had chosen for her: 'Walk worthy of the voca- 
tion wherewith ye are called. ' — Something of the 
same sort of motive appears in Miss Cally R'yland's 
'The Taming of Betty' (Lee & Shepard), but in this 
case Betty is a high-spirited Virginia girl who needs 
a lot of taming. She comes into her own at last 
through much adversity, after an unusual experience 
in boarding-school. — The well-known heroine of a 
previous work by Mrs. Clara Louise Burnham 
reappears in 'Jewel's Story Book' (Houghton), by 
the same author. The new book is a collection of 
tales, in the nature of Christian Science tracts, 
strung along a slender thread of entertaining nar- 
rative. — The triumph of girlish human nature over 
conventional obstacles is well portrayed by 
Miss Mary F. Leonard in 'It All Came 
True' (Crowell). A rich little girl becomes 
acquainted with some poorer neighbors during 
her parents' absence from home, her uncle 
being the medium of acquaintance. — A story of 
spiritual and mystical significance, of true literary 
value but with a secondary appeal to children, is 
Mrs. Frances Hodgson Burnett's 'In the Closed 
Room' (McClure, Phillips & Co.). The daughter 



of the caretakers in a temporarily deserted man- 
sion in New York plays with the spirit of the little 
daughter of the house in the room in which she 
died. It is a story not to be forgotten when read. 
The pictures and decorations, by Miss Jessie Will- 
cox Smith, deserve high praise. 

The lack of dramatic instinct among 
^ °\sa^ike northern races in comparison with the 

^^^ ' Latins has kept English-speaking 

children from the delights depicted so successfully 
by Miss Georgiana Goddard King in her 'Comedies 
and Legends for Marionettes: A Theatre for Boys 
and Girls' (Macmillan). With the pictures pro- 
vided by Miss Anna E. Giles it is possible for any 
child to construct a stage and make the characters 
which take part in the clever plays. — A charming 
book that tells of the uses of adversity as reflected 
in the lives of small boys and girls has been writ- 
ten by Miss Marion Ames Taggart in 'The Little 
Gray House' (McClure, Phillips & Co.), published 
with beautiful pictures by Miss Ethel Franklin 
Betts. — Two brothers and two sisters, the 'frolic- 
some four' of one of last year's stories, appear 
once more in Miss Edith L. Gilbert's 'The Making 
of Meenie' (Lee & Shepard). These four, with 
an older visitor from Canada, bring up the little 
heroine, a waif, in the manner that any little girl 
should go. — Another story of apartment life in a 
great city is told by Miss Nina Ehoades in 'The 
Children on the Top Floor' (Lee & Shepard). The 
little heroine is the means of bringing her widowed 
mother into pleasant contact with the . world out- 
side, herself making the acquaintance of a little 
crippled boy who has much influence on her. — 
Pleasanter boys and girls could hardly be found 
than those that Mrs. Laura E. Eichards tell us of 
in 'The Merryweathers ' (Estes). The family and 
its friends spend a happy summer out of doors, and 
there is a romantic ending for good measure. — A 
striking collection of stories and pictures of the 
Chinese little ones in San Francisco has been made 
by Mrs. Jessie Juliet Knox in her volume entitled 
'Little Almond Blossoms' (Little, Brown & Co.). 
The book will serve the most useful of purposes in 
acquainting American children with their Chinese 
fellows, and so divest them of prejudice as they 
grow older, — Mrs. Margaret Sidney has taken up 
the 'Five Little Peppers and Their Friends' (Loth- 
rop) this year. Her concern is rather more with the 
small friends than with the ever-delightful Pep- 
pers themselves. — A grateful collection of little 
stories has been made by Miss Eosalind Eichards 
in 'The Nursery Fire' (Little, Brown & Co.), illus- 
trated by Miss Clara E. Atwood. It contains tales 
admirably adapted to the intelligence of the small 
fry still in the nursery. — Miss Gertrude Smith bids 
fair to repeat her successes of previous years in the 
pretty book of pretty stories, 'Little Precious' 
(Harper). Those who know the 'Eoggie and E'eg- 
gie' and other stories from this facile pen will 
need to ask nothing further about the new volume. 
— The amiable and humorously inclined goat with 
which Mrs. Frances Trego Montgomery's readers 
are already familiar appears in the second gener- 
ation in 'Billy Whiskers, Jr.' (Saalfield), The ani- 
mal is still in the West, among cowboys and 
Indians, and is busier than any of them. — 'Puss 
in the Corner' (Estes) is one of the little rebus 
books Miss Edith Frances Foster has made so 
popular, the story being told in part by pictures, 
to eke out the vocabularies of those for whom it 
is written. — The response made by Mr. Jacob A. 
Eiis to the query of a little Kansas girl 
serves for the context, as the query itself 
serves for the title, of 'Is There a Santa

Claus?' (Macmillan). If anybody takes a negative 
point of view, he will be ashamed of his scepticism 
when he finishes reading this little book. — Miss 
Charlotte M. Vaile, in 'The Truth about Santa 
Claus' (Crowell), clothes the old history of Saint 
Nicholas in words that have a modern meaning 
and which add new beauty to the Christmas festi- 
val. — Dr. George Hodges has taken a number of 
little episodes from the life of the Saviour and 
retold them in his admirable book called 'When 
the King Came' (Houghton), the result constitut- 
ing a praiseworthy history of that marvellous life. 
— Similar in kind is Mrs. Margaret E. Sangster 's 
'That Sweet, Sweet Story of Old: A Life of Christ 
for the Young' (Kevell). It is longer and more 
detailed than the book of Dean Hodges, but it 
rings true throughout. 

Books dealing with animals and with 
aniZattories. "**"'*® i^fease in number year by 

year, and grow more and more 
ingenious in their utilization of natural things. In 
'River-Land' (Harper), Mr. Robert W. Chambers 
brings together literary quality, a working knowl- 
edge of the living things in and about an Ameri- 
can river, and marked powers of imagination and 
poetic feeling, producing a work that should last 
through more than one season. The pictures in 
color, by Miss Elizabeth Shippen Green, are unusu- 
ally attractive. — In 'The Well in the Wood' 
(Bobbs-Merrill Co.) Mr. Bert Leston Taylor util- 
izes a pretty fancy and a knowledge at first hand 
of the woods of Michigan to build around a little 
girl as alluring and natural a fairy story as could 
be wished, the creatures of the forest taking a 
prominent part. — Animals in captivity enter into 
similarly intimate relations with a little girl and 
a crippled boy in the well illustrated and otherwise 
handsome book called 'Two in a Zoo' (Bobbs-Mer- 
rill Co.), the joint product of Messrs. Curtis Dun- 
ham and Oliver Herford. — It is to the ocean that 
Mrs. Arthur Sherburne Hardy goes for the material 
in 'Sea Stories for Wonder Eyes' (Ginn), and she 
makes a skillful and interesting disposition of it, 
suited to expanding intelligences. — Well grounde(l 
in knowledge evidently derived largely from per- 
sonal observation, Mr. Clarence Hawkes produces 
a volume that can be depended upon in his 'Stories 
of the Good Greenwood' (Crowell). It contains 
much real woodcraft, and is uniformly sympa- 
thetic and humane. — 'Sportsman Joe' (Macmillan) 
is by Mr. Edwyn Sandys and is filled with the loro 
of shooting and fishing, detailing the performances 
of a young New York boy of means who goes out 
into the mountains with an old friend of his fath- 
er's and learns the habits of animals, fish, and game 
birds. — Miss Effie Bignell is concerned first with 
a number of red squirrels, whom she views more 
tenderly than do most naturalists, and subsequently 
with the five grey squirrels which figure in the title 
of her book, 'A Quintette of Greycoats' (Baker & 
Taylor Co.). It is an entertaining family. — There 
is nothing else quite so notable as the story of the 
hen Eml'y in Miss Clara Dillingham Pierson's 
'Tales of a Poultry Farm' (Dutton), but all the 
tales are interesting, and one comes away from the 
book with a better opinion of the intelligence of 
the domestic fowl. — Stories in prose and verse by 
Miss Alice Calhoun R'hines and fine illustrations in 
color by Mr. Louis Rhead go to make up the quarto 
volume entitled 'Pets' (Stokes). It is a book for 
any small child with a natural fondness for ani- 
mals, telling pleasant little anecdotes of domestic 
birds and beasts. — Plowers and the care of them 
are the subjects of 'Mary's Garden and How It 
Grew' (Century Co.), the really practical informa- 



tion it contains being conveyed through the asso- 
ciation of a little girl and a neighboring Swiss who 
made his living by horticulture. — 'Johnny Crow's 
Garden' (Warne) is a little boy's book written and 
illustrated by Mr. L. Leslie Brooke. It deals with 
a lot of cheerful things in and about the garden 
patch, and there are attractive pictures in color 
to give it zest. — Animals manifest the character- 
istics of human creatures in 'Jim Crow's Language 
Lessons' (Crowell). Very small people will enjoy 
the stories, which are chiefly concerned with the 
veritable doings of house pets. — In 'Lady Spider '^ 
(Estes) Miss Harriet A. Cheever describes how a 
pretty romance that took place in a king's palace 
appeared to the observer in her web above, the 
spinner of the web being also the spinner of the 
yarn. — Another book by Miss Cheever, ' The Rock 
Frog' (Estes), tells in an autobiographic way the 
history of a frog that grew too fat to escape from 
the crack in a rock into which he was wedged, 
what he saw while imprisoned, and what happened 
after a storm released him. 

„, , Fairy tales and stories of the 'Ara- 

WoZerland. ^^^^ Nights' order are not often 
attempted by modern imaginations, 
but collections of the old legends are perennially 
popular. Mr. Andrew Lang has not yet exhausted 
tne supply of these last, although he has to go to 
countries more and more remote for every new^ 
year's gleanings. For the material in his latest 
volume, 'The Brown Fairy Book' (Longmans), he 
has searched the folk lore of the red Indians, the 
black Australians, the African Kaffirs, and the 
natives of Brazil and New Caledonia. Besides 
these, there are some tales of moment from the 
French and Persian, some of them being specially 
translated for this work. The beautiful illustra- 
tions in color are the work of Mr. Henry Ford. 
— It is chiefly from the Algonkins and Ojibways 
that Mr. Howard Angus Kennedy obtains the mate- 
rial his 'New World Fairy Book' (Dutton). Many 
of the tales are familiar to well-read American 
children, and all deserve to be. Mr. H. R. Millar 
has supplied some fine pictures. — E. Nesbit (Mrs. 
Hubert Bland) writes a most amusing story in 
'The Phoenix and the Carpet' (Macmillan). The 
fabled bird of antiquity hatches himself from his 
egg in a nursery grate, and discovers that the car- 
pet on the floor has the power of granting three 
wishes each day to those who know it. — Mrs. Abbie 
Farwell Brown tells four fairy stories of her own 
invention in 'The Flower Princess' (Houghton). 
The tale of Fleurette and Joyeuse will be a delight 
to children. — It is not with entire success that Mr. 
Walter Burges Smith carries on Lewis Carroll's 
idea in his 'Looking for Alice' (Lothrop). Per- 
haps the most original thing about the book is the 
motto on the cover, 'Write makes mite.' — Of the 
'Alice in Wonderland' sort are the seven tales Miss 
Grace E. Ward has told in the pretty little book 
named 'In the Miz' (Little, Brown & Co.) There 
is something of the inconsecutiveness of dream- 
land in the narrative, and the pictures by Miss 
Clara E. Atwood add to the illusion. — 'Babes iu 
Toy land' (Fox, Duffield & Co.) is a pretty book 
made by Mr. Glen McDonough and Miss Anna Alice 
Chapin from the popular musical comedy of the 
same name. The delightful pictures in color are 
the work of Miss Ethel F. Betts. — Messrs. Paul 
West and William Wallace Denslow are the authors, 
and Mr. Denslow the illustrator, of 'The Pearl and 
the Pumpkin' (Dillingham). The scene shifts from 
a country village through various parts of the 
world, with fairies and other supernatural beings 
always in attendance. The pictures are in Mr,

popular 'Wizard of Oz, ' with several of the same 
characters and three new ones of much cleverness. 
The book is of real merit, and Mr. John R. Neill 
has done well with the illustrations. — Both text and 
pictures of 'Fantasma Land' (Bobbs-Merrill Co.) 
are the work of Mr. Charles Raymond Macauley. 
The story is sincerely and commendably fantastic, 
using the ordinary affairs of earth with entire 
incongruity.

other the manner in which nature compels them to 
behave. The drawings are exceedingly clever. — 
That standard annual 'The Chatterbox' (Estes)

Polk: The Eskimos, the Bears, the Dogs, the Musk

(Stokes). It is a collection of reproduced photo- 
graphs, with a little narrative telling of life in the 
realm of perpetual frost, the whole being both 
interesting and! instructive. — Marked originality 
is to be found in the pictures which are the chief 
feature of Mr. Augustus L. Jansson's 'Hobby Hoss 
Fair' (Caldwell). The drawings are in color, and 
exhibit a combination of curves and straight lines 
that is nothing less than impressive. Jingles 
accompany the pictures. — Life in the South is told 
in pictures and rhymes, both the work of Mrs. 
Clara Andrews Williams, in 'Mammy's Li'l' Chil-

and shrewd. — A country where all the animals in 
the menagerie are made of sweets has been discov- 
ered by Miss Olive Aye, who tells about it in 
'Santa Glaus 's Wonderful Candy Circus' (Laird

in color by Mr. A. T. Williamson. Originality like 
this is both welcome and uncommon. — Nothing 
more graceful and delicate has been published this 
year than 'When Little Boys Sing' (McClurg;, 
the joint product of John and Rue Carpenter (Mr. 
and Mrs. John A. Carpenter). Rhymes of real 
feeling and real fun, interpretative pictures admir- 
ably worked out by one of the beautiful modern 
■color processes, and charming little melodies for 
the rhymes, go to make up a combination most 
unusual and very much to be commended. — The 
old nursery rhymes that everybody knows and 
loves are given a new use by Mr. Willard Bonte in 
'The Mother Goose Puzzle Book' (Dutton). It is 
a book made up of pictures wherein may be discov- 
ered some famous person or animal referred to in 
the accompanying jingles. — Mr. William Wallace 
Denslow has this season produced, in his own inim- 
itable manner, six thin nursery books, printed in 
colors. The titles are as follows: ' Denslow 's 
Barn-Yard Circus,' 'Simple Simon,' 'Three Little 
Kittens,' 'Mother Goose ABC Book,' 'Animal 
Fair,' and 'Scare Crow and Tin Man' (Dilling- 
ham). All appear with the authentic text except- 
ing the last named, which continues the adven- 
tures of two characters well known to American 
children. — Mr. Kenyon Cox's 'Mixed Beasts' (Fox, 
Duffield & Co.) is a slim volume wherein the lover 
ol 'unnatural history' can learn of such composites 
as the kangarooster, the indianaconda, tlie elephan- 



tom, the rhinoscerostrich, and the scallopossum. 
'There is nothing original about the book,' Mr. Cox 
rightly observes, 'except the rhymes and the pic- 
tures. ' — In his happiest manner Mr, Palmer Cox 
tells in both rhymes and picture the story of 'The 
Brownies in the Philippines' (Century Co,), The 
Brownies visit all the islands, and have their usual 
good time on all occasions, — Miss Virginia Gerson 
has devised an interesting family of parents and 
children with bodies shaped like the conventional 
heart, and she tells of their numerous adventures 
through colored pictures and humorous text in 
'The Happy Heart Family' (Fox, Duffield & Co,). 
The book will amuse any little person fortunate 
enough to possess it, — 'The Golliwog in Holland' 
(Longmans), with verses by Miss Bertha Upton 
and pictures in color by Miss Florence K, Upton, 
marks the annual appearance of that fascinating 
individual and his friends, so well known to the 
present generation of children. All of the char- 
acters show in the new book their undiminished 
vitality and capacity for getting into mischief. 



Notes. 



A timely volume on 'Arbitration and the Hague 
Court,' by Hon, John W, Foster, Ex-Secretary of 
State and the author of two books on American 
diplomacy, will be issued immediately by Messrs, 
Houghton, Mifflin & Co, 

An account by Major Louis L, Seaman of his per- 
sonal experiences with both the Russian and Japan- 
ese armies during the past six months is announced 
for immediate publication by Messrs: D, Appletou 
& Co,, under the title 'Prom Tokio through Man- 
churia with the Japanese,' 

'Monsieur Dupin: The Detective Tales of Edgar 
Allan Poe,' is the title of a reprint issued by 
Messrs, McClure, Phillips & Co, The volume 
includes five of the most familiar of Poe's tales of 
mystery, and is illustrated by Mr, Charles Raymond 
Macauley. 

Banks and Banking, Railroads, Immigration, and 
the Par East, are the subjects of the latest batch 
of bibliographies sent us by the Library of Con- 
gress, These publications also include a 'Check 
List of Large Scale Maps Published by Foreign 
Governments, ' 

'The School Chemistry,' by Dr, Elroy M, Avery, 
is the latest form of a text-book that has been 
deservedly popular for a quarter of a century. The 
work is said to be entirely rewritten. It is pub- 
lished by the American Book Co,, from whom we 
have also received an 'Elementary Grammar' by 
Dr, William H, Maxwell, 

Professor James Harvey Robinson, who has given 
us perhaps the best of our text-books on the history 
of mediaeval and modern Europe, now supplements 
that work with a collection of 'Readings in Euro- 
pean History' to be used as source material for the 
student. There are to be two volumes, of which 
the first is at hand, and the second promised for 
early appearance, Messrs, Ginn & Co, are the pub- 
lishers, 

'The mini: A Story of the Prairies' is the title 
of an interesting volume soon to be issued by 
Messrs, A. C, McClurg & Co, The author is Hon. 
Clark E, Carr, late United States Minister to Den- 
mark, and his book presents in narrative form a 
reminiscent and historical account of his own event- 
ful life in Illinois from 1850 to the Civil War, and 
of the many famous men and important events he 
has been connected with during that period.

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



Two new volumes have been added to the sub- 
scription edition of Tourguenieff published by 
Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. Their contents 
are short stories, ten in number, among which we 
may mention 'First Love,' 'Asya,' and 'Faust,' 
that gem of purest ray serene. The edi:tion is now 
within three volumes of completion, 

'The Land and Sea Mammals of Middle America 
and the West Indies, ' by Mr. Daniel Giraud Elliott, 
is a recent work of great importance published by 
the Field Columbian Museum. It is a classified 
descriptive list of species, illustrated with a great 
number of plates, and filling two thick octavo vol- 
umes of more than four hundred pages each. 

The new edition of Shelley soon to be published 
by the Oxford University Press will include, in 
addition to the poems contained in every previous 
edition, the important fragments recovered by Mr. 
C. D. Locock from the Bodleian MSS., and the early 
poems first published in Professor Dowden's Life 
of Shelley. The volume is being edited by Mr. 
Thomas Hutchinson. 

A limited edition of Rembrandt's Etchings, with 
descriptive text by Philip Gilbert Hamerton and a 
complete annotated catalogue, introduction, and 
notes by Mr. Campbell Dodgson of the British 
Museum, has just been published by Messrs. Little, 
Brown & Co. The volume includes fifty reproduc- 
tions in photogravure of Rembrandt's most notable 
etchings. 

*A History Syllabus for Secondary Schools,' pre- 
pared by a special committee of the New England 
History Teachers' Association, is published by 
Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. It is the work of many 
hands, and outlines the four years' course of his- 
torical study now pursued in all our high schools 
of the first class. The work may also be had in 
four pamphlet parts, each covering one year of 
the course. 

*A History of the Ancient World,' by Professor 
George Stephen Goodspeed, is the latest candidate 
for the favor of secondary teachers of this subject. 
Mechanically and artistically, it is one of the most 
attractive text-books we have ever seen, while 
pedagogically it is provided with the apparatus 
required by the most progressive modern methods 
of instruction. The work is published by Messrs. 
Charles Scribner's Sons.

Tenth Season of the California Limited. 

Ten years ago this fall the Santa Fe started its 
California Limited train on the initial run across the 
continent. Many improvements have been made in that 
busy decade. To-day's engines and coaches are much 
heavier than those of 1894. Millions of dollars have 
been spent on the track alone — some of it for oil- 
sprinkled (dustless) roadbed and oil-burning (smoke- 
less) engines. The time is faster, too. 

Daily service of the California Limited was resumed 
Sunday, November 13, for the tenth season. This is 
now an all-the-year- 'round train, between Chicago, Los 
Angeles and San Francisco, running through the South- 
west land of enchantment. The time, Chicago to Los 
Angeles, is about 68 hours, which is fast speed for 
the 2265 miles traversed, considering that several 
mountain ranges are crossed.

INDEX TO POETRY 
AND RECITATIONS 

Being a Practical Reference Manual for the Librarian, 

Teacher, Bookseller, Elocutionist, etc. 

Edited by EDITH GRANGER, A.B. 

THIS important work, so long delayed by the necessary enlarging of 
the plan, is now ready for delivery. It is a volume of incalculable 
value, and the advance interest in its publication is an indication of the 
practical necessity for a book of such scope and comprehension. As a 
labor and time saving reference work it has never been equaled, and 
those for whom it is particularly intended should lose no time in plac- 
ing it on their shelves. 

The work indexes very nearly four hundred standard and popular 
collections of poetry and recitation books, including dialogues, ora- 
tions, drills, etc., comprising about thirty thousand titles, arranged

appendix contains lists of titles suitable for special occasions, such as 
Arbor Day, Washington's Birthday, etc., also lists of drills, tableaux,

These two important volumes are just issued in the Historic 

Highways of America series. 
I IFE in the heyday of the canal boats, when canals were 
^^ the great immigrant and freight routes; portage rail- 
ways and the lock navigation of rivers. Special reference is 
made to the influence of canals in directing trade and im- 
migration in the days when they were controlling factors in 
our national development, and attention is given to the study 
of George Washington's early plans of western irrigation. 
''In interest and suggestions the two volumes may well 
tempt many an engineer to add somewhat to his library, 
particularly as good books dealing with the history of early 
American engineering works are few and far between." 

— Engineering News, 
" It is needless to say that Mr. Hulbert has made an inter- 
esting work of his subject and set forth much useful informa- 
tion — a worthy addition to this valuable series."

bution to the makings of American History."

for supremacy in control among American railroads and of 
the development and rebuilding of the transcontinental systems. 
A work of striking and dramatic interest covering the recent 
history of railway life and operation in America. 

The IVall Street Journal says : " The volume helps to fill an important 
blank in the library of railroad literature. ... In his description of the 
engineering and executive difficulties faced by the various managements, 
the author is particularly happy, and his remarks on such points are of a

seem not to be style at all ; yet here many will agree is 
the pure essence of good writing — the 'English unde- 
filed ' of Dan Chaucer. Moreover, Mr. Lee writes out 
of so full and well-ordered a mind, that he, more than 
most writers, is able to make his sixteenth-century subjects stand out clear and strong 
from the crowded background, which has been filled in by so many successive gener-

"It is safe to say that 'The 
Soldier of the Valley ' will 
find a host of admirers. 
Some will like it as a story. 
The more critical will be 
glad to make the acquaint- 
ance in its pages of a lot of 
very live people with very 
marked characteristics." — 
New York E'vening Sun. 

by A. B. Frost. 
Si. 50. 



" It would be difficult to find 
anywhere in recent fiction a 
novel that is so vivid and 
graphic a picture of life. It 
is vital and vigorous, a hu- 
man picture, where men and 
women of flesh and blood and 
not manikins move and have 
their being." — Brooklyn Eagle.

" One of the most bitterly brilliant satires that has issued from 
the press for many a day. Every chapter teems with clever- 
ness, it bubbles up and flows over, till one almost feels as if too 
many good things were being given at once. It is the epic 
story of the great fight between the frothy, unstable, speculat- 
ing methods of the modern financier, and the solid, honest, 
unadventurous tradmg of the men who made England at one 
time the first of commercial nations." — Academy.

FLORENCE IN THE 

POETRY OF 

THE BROWNINGS 

S an actual gift-book this alto- 
gether admirable volume covers 
a wider field than almost any similar 
publication of the present season. 
Mrs. Anna Benneson McMahan, 
whose entire familiarity with the 
Browning poetry and with Florence 
itself is well known, has compiled the 
volume with the utmost sympathy and appreciation. To both poets the history, the scenery, the 
art of Florence was a continual inspiration — "the most beautiful of the cities devised by man," as 
Mrs. Browning said. The poems comprise " Casa Guidi Windows," "The Dance," "Old 
Pictures in Florence," " Fra Lippo Lippi," " Andrea del Sarto," " The Statue and the Bust," 
" The Ring and the Book " (Book I), and " One Word More." In itself this would seem to be 
enough, but the interest is further enhanced by over sixty beautiful reproductions of the famous 
paintings and scenes which have been immortalized. It will be seen that the book appeals equally 
to lovers of art, lovers of Florence, and lovers of Browning, — surely a wide field. The sumptuous 
limited editions are as beautiful examples of modern book-making as the most exacting connoisseur 
could desire, while in its regular edition the book is a veritable treasure as a reference guide.

SUMPTUOUS EDITIONS OF AMERICANA 

CONSIDERATION of a suitable gift for the library of a book-lover need go 
no further than the limited editions of the McClurg Americana reprints. 
Seldom has the perfection of modern book-making, as represented by noble 
and dignified simplicity, been so nearly attained as in these beautiful volumes. 
The three titles so far issued, uniform in style, make-up, and binding, are 
printed on Brown's hand-made paper, with illustrations on Japan vellum, and 
bound in boards with vellum backs stamped in gold. It may be imagined 
with what pleasure any of these would be received by an appreciative col- 
lector of Americana or of fine editions.

" IT is," says The Dial., "a book for boys, for women, but above all it is a book for men who have 

I once been boys. It is a book to own — to read by the Winter's fire, and re-read under a Summer 

tree; a book to be kept on the shelf where the oldest favorites live." If a book thus characterized 

is not the book to give an appreciative friend, it would be hard to find one. Price ^i.^o.

McCLURG'S HOLIDA Y BOOKS FOR 1904 





MY LADY OF THE NORTH 

EVERYONE knows what a large proportion of the people who receive 
Christmas gifts are best pleased with a fine, exciting story, full of 
romance, and well illustrated with pictures in color. Such a book is not 
expensive, and it is almost certain to give perfect satisfaction. 

For this purpose Mr. Randall Parrish's " love story of a Gray- 
Jacket " can be unhesitatingly recommended as the best possible ch'oicfe. 
It has all the requirements, and it is equally interesting to men and wornen 
(and even to younger readers). The many bajffling'situations which con- 
front Captain Wayne of the — th Virginia Cavalry before he finally wins his 
"Lady of the North'' are certain to hold the reader's breathless interest. 
Illustrqted in color by E. M. Jshe. $1.30. 

STIRRING FICTION FOR CHILDREN 

WHEN the age of fairy-lore is passed, the next tendency of young readers is 
generally towards a story with plenty of exciting adventure for the youth- 
ful hero or heroine. Two ideal books of this class are Miss Sanford's " The 
Wandering Twins" and Ernest Glanville's "In Search of the Okapi." 

The first tells of the adventures of two children in Labrador, and leads them through a 
succession of strange and unusual occurrences. With eight full-page illustrations. $1.2^. 
Mr. Glanville's story is in the true Henty style, dear to the boyish heart, and tells 
of the adventures which befell two young explorers on a journey into the strangest parts of 
Africa. There is any amount of the most thrilling excitement, and it will be the book of 
all others for a healthy boy of almost any age. With eight full-page illustrations. $i.§o. 

LIFE STORIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE 

FOR pa;-ents who feel disposed to give their children books that provide a 
mild element of historical information, as well as first-class entertainment, 
this new series will prove a veritable find. The little books are translated 
from the German by George P. Upton, and each one tells in a simple and cap- 
tivating style the story of some great life that has figured in the world's history. 
The volumes so far published are "William Tell," "Mozart," "The 
Maid of Orleans," and " Beethoven," and many more are contemplated. 
Each is a small square i6mo in uniform bindings with ^ illustrations. 60 cts. net. 

WHEN LITTLE BOYS SING 

THIS delightful book, by John and Rue Carpenter, is one of the most engaging 
holiday books of the entire season. Quaint colored illustrations of little boys 
of the "long ago," with verses set to charming music that is intended to be sung to 
little music-lovers, its originality and freshness make it almost as attractive to older 
people as to the children themselves. It is one of those books which create a sense of 
delightful anticipation at the first glimpse of the cover, and a final realization that here, 
at least, is something really new. Bound in colored chintz., iixi^ inches. $T.2j net. 

THE LITTLE GIANT 

ALTHOUGH the late Dr. Thomas Dunn English was most generally known as the author of 
" Ben Bolt," his own greatest pleasure was in the telling of stories for little children. Four 
fairy tales that have hitherto been undiscovered have been collected in this volume, and they will 
be recognized as coming from a practiced hand. They have been most attractively illustrated by 
Lucy Fitch Perkins, whose fame as an artist of fairyland is now established. Price ^i.oo net.

A History of Science 

By HENRY SMITH WILLIAMS, B.Sc, M.D., LL.D. 

Author of " The Story of Nineteenth Century Science," " The History of the Art of Writing," editor of 
"The Historian's History of the World," etc. 

IN FIVE VOLUMES 

Profusely Illustrated with Portraits of Famous Scientists, Diagrams, Facsimiles, Pictures, etc. 



A HISTORY OF SCIENCE is the story of the origin and 
development of scientific thought, discovery, and invention 
from the earliest times to the present day. It traces the 
growth of ideas from the first vague dreamings of pre-historic 
man down to the precise inductions of the twentieth-century scien- 
tist in his laboratory. From this view-point the story of hitman 
progress presents the most wonderful and interesting spectacle^ — 
a chapter of man's history that has never before been written in 
its entirety. 

The work is scientifically accurate in statement and yet devoid 
of all technicalities throughout. It will fascinate the general 
reader while commanding the respect of the most critical of students. 
There is no straining after the spectacular or picturesque at the 
expense of truth, yet so fascinating is the story in itself, so wide 
the opportunity for the play of the scientific imagination, that the 
narrative has all tlie charm, attraction, and compelling power of 
romance.

We were discussing recently the multiplica- 
tion of new editions of old authors which is 
go characteristic a feature of our present-day 
industry of book-making. Hardly less char- 
acteristic is the busy way in which we are 
engaged in making new books, in form, out 
of the literary accumulations of the past ; these 
condensations, rearrangements, anthologies, 
compilations, and special series seem to be the 
result of a determined effort to give the great-

est possible availability to the literature already 
existing, whether or not we make any appre- 
ciable addition to its amount. If we may liken 
the bondage of the modem literary hack to his 
publisher with that of the chosen tribe of old 
to their Egyptian taskmasters, we cannot 
fairly claim for him that he is forced to make 
his bricks without straw; on the contrary, he 
is provided in abundance with straw of the 
toughest quality, which a very common sort of 
clay will cement into the most serviceable of 
briclvs. 

Changing the metaphor for a moment, we 
are reminded of the way in which the temples 
and palaces, the aqueducts and amphitheatres, 
of the ancient world served for the decadent 
following centuries as storehouses of building 
material already quarried and shaped for use. 
However much we may regret this destruction 
of monuments by the barbarian successors of 
the ancients who erected them, and deplore the 
return to baser uses of the marble blocks which 
once embodied the noblest ideals of a vanished 
civilization, we must agree that something is to 
be said for the utilitarian aspect of the vandal- 
ism. The men responsible for it had much 
need of the walls and dwellings which they 
built -^vith these fragments of old glory, and no 
need at all of the structures which they so 
ruthlessly destroyed. Something like this 
apology may be made for our modem builders 
of books out of the hewn blocks of the classics, 
but the two cases, parallel for figurative pur- 
poses, become divergent in the light of fact, for 
it is happily true that we may construct any 
number of modem books from material offered 
by the ancient monuments of literature, and 
still preserve these monuments intact for the 
joy of those who cherish them. 

A certain detachment of spirit, and a certain 
degree of freedom from the pressure of modem 
life, are the conditions precedent to the full 
enjoyment of the great masterpieces of litera- 
ture. Happy is the man who can at all times 
command this freedom and this detachment; 
measurably happy is also the man who knows 
even at intervals this ' blessed mood ' of spiritual 
emancipation from perplexity and care. But 
there are many men who would almost never 
come into contact with the noblest literature 
were it accessible only upon such terms, and 
for these the humble service of the compiler 
or the anthologist is not to be despised. He, at 
least, points out the path to the heights, and 
the glimpse of their distant splendor, caught 
for the moment, may lighten not a little the 
burden of the day, and remain an inspiration 
to keep the soul alive in the most sluggish and 
suffocating atmosphere. 

N'evertheless, in spite of its obvious useful- 
ness, the practice of making books out of other 



books appears to be overdone. We have had 
something like a surfeit of libraries of universal 
literature, and more than a surfeit of special 
anthological compilations. Of these enter- 
prises, large and small, much more of good 
than is actually possible might be said were 
they honestly carried out, with an eye single 
to their ideal purpose, whatever it might be. 
That they are not so executed becomes only too 
evident upon examination. They are books 
made to sell, and they illustrate all the com- 
mercial complications of this aim. To the 
genuine lover of literature they are anathema, 
because they permit the sublime to jostle with 
the vulgar, the worthy with the meretricious, 
and the pure gold of the artist with the brum- 
magem of the charlatan. What must be the 
judgment of a man with any standards at all 
upon a collection of oratory which includes 
both Demosthenes and Mr. Albert Beveridge, a 
collection of essays which includes both Bacon 
and Mr. Edward Bok, a collection of poetry 
which includes both Virgil and Mr. James 
Whitcomb Riley, a collection of music which 
includes both Bach and Mr. Eeginald 
Delvoven? Yet with such strange bedfellows 
are the great made acquainted through the 
craft of the callous modem compiler and the 
commercial publisher at whose behest he plies 
his conscienceless calling. 

If the aim of these incongnious juxtaposi- 
tions were simply historical, which it is not, 
they might be justified as startling object-les- 
sons in the decline of modern literary taste. To 
the mental vision of proper adjustment the 
popular writers of the day provide horrible 
examples in the contrast offered by their tinsel 
trappings to the sterling ornaments of the 
approved artists. But no such instructive pur- 
pose is to be detected in the heterogeneous com- 
pilations to which our attention is so insistently 
called by advertisements and circular appeals 
and the persuasions of smooth-tongued agents. 
These devices of publicity are deliberately 
employed to beguile unwary persons into the 
purchase of sets of books which confuse the 
sense of literary values, and encourage the far 
too prevalent delusion that frothy and vapid 
writers, who happen for the moment to enjoy 
the favor of an indiscriminating public, have 
some standing in the literary areopagus. Thus 
the influence of these anthological collections is 
vicious in so far as it sets the worthless upon 
the level of the excellent, and it is still further 
vicious in the encouragement which it gives to 
the reading of snippets as a substitute for the 
reading of complete works. Books of this 
description are incitements to a sham and 
superficial culture; about the only thing that 
may be urged in their behalf is that they bring 
some fragments of good literature within the

ken of readers who might otherwise go through 
life without coming into any contact at all with 
the masters. 

But however serious the exceptions that may 
be taken to the multiplication of libraries of 
literature and collections of ' elegant extracts/ 
the work of producing them will go merrily 
on, for the plain reason that they meet an exist- 
ing demand. It is a demand fostered by the 
hurry and the nervous tension and the wasted 
energies of the age in which we live. We have 
a large reading public that battons on the moor 
because the mountain pasture seems too dif- 
ficult of access, that prefers the gossip of house- 
maids and stable-boys to the converse of kings 
and queens because it would feel uncomfortable 
in the presence of royalty. We are confronted 
by a condition, not a theor}^, and we must make 
the best of it. And if we choose to construct 
our intellectual habitations from the bricks of 
the anthologists, there is some slight consola- 
tion in the fact that these bricks are not wholly 
made of common clay, that they are not with- 
out some Avholesome admixture of strengthening 
fibre. 



THREE BOOKS ON SHAKESPEARE. 



Whether or not Mr. Barrett Wendell's book 
on Shakespeare has achieved the reputation it 
deserves, I cannot say. At any rate it has now 
half completed its nonage; it is through with 
the perils of teething and infantile diseases; it 
has reached the time when it naturally begins 
to put on the graces and vivacities of youth; 
intelligent people can take an interest in it. 
The work is remarkable in two respects. First, 
for its criticism, which, barring Lowell's great 
essay and the brilliant dashes of Eichard Grant 
White into this field, is the best Shakespearian 
interpretation we have had in our country^ ; and, 
second, for its biographical theories, which are 
singularly anticipative of those held by the 
great Danish critic, Georg Brandes. Mr. Wen- 
dell's book indeed might almost stand as a pre- 
liminary study for Brandes's work. To a cer- 
tain extent, ever since the chronology of Shakes- 
peare's plays has been tolerably settled, these 
theories have been in the air. The great breaks, 
almost amounting to a solution of continuity 
between the happiness of the work of Shakes- 
peare's youthful prime, the black pessimism 
and blank despair of his tremendous tragic 
epoch, and the renewed peace, though ruffled 
with the swell of the preceding storm, of his 
final period, are too apparent not to have led 
many students to seek an explanation for such 
changes in the facts of Shakespeare's own life. 

Mr. Wendell is at his best in his treatment of 
Shakespeare's tragedies. One might say that he 
has read them in the light of Jonathan Ed- 



wards and found in them an essential Calvin- 
ism. In his view Shakespeare at his greatest 
was mad, — or, at least, only saved from mad- 
ness by his artistic instinct. This madness was 
partially caused by his relations with women, 
his conviction of their trivialty and baseness, 
and partially by his contemplation of the whole 
problem of evil in the universe. Certainly 
Shakespeare's attitude towards this problem is 
different from that of the other three world- 
poets who may claim equalit}^ with him. In 
Homer the problem is put aside. Things are 
as they are : the gods have appointed them ; the 
gods themselves are subject to Fate; it is not 
worth while to make a fuss; let us fight and 
enjoy and put off death, the only irretrievable 
ill, as long as possible. In Dante the world is but 
a welter of gloom, a shadow flung upward from 
the fires of hell. But Faith can find a path 
through those shadows and these fires. Man- 
kind may be saved by faith. Goethe is the real 
Protestant poet. Evil is everywhere, and no 
one can keep his feet from it. But man may 
be saved by Works. Dig a canal or make two 
blades of grass grow where one grew before and 
all vnll be forgiven. Shakespeare has neither 
the acquiescence of Homer, the faith of Dante, 
nor the utilitarian tolerance of Goethe. He 
struggles fearfully to find a footing in the abyss 
of the world. Sometimes he is a Pyrrhonist, 
and says that nothing is either good or bad but 
thinking makes it so. Sometimes, as Mr. Wen- 
dell suggests, he is plunged in Calvinism. This 
world is bad and there is a worse hereafter. 
For nearly all, inevitable damnation awaits. 
The best we can hope is oblivion, — ^ what the 
sleeping rocks dream of.' But at other times I 
think he rises to an older and more primeval 
creed, — the philosophy of Zoroaster. Good and 
Evil, equal gods, contend in the world and 
throughout the infinite; and the strife is eter- 
nal. 

There is one opinion of Mr. Wendell's con- 
cerning the tragedies with which I particularly 
agree. It is that " Macbeth ' is Shakespeare's 
most perfect, has profoundest piece. It has not 
the personal appeal of ' Hamlet' ; it has not the 
all-culminating power of ' King Lear.' But in 
its artistry, — its pictorial beauty and grandeur, 
its absolute keeping, its clash of character, the 
swiftness and crash of events, it is unequalled. 
By reason of its concentration and reserve, it 
ds Shakespeare's one drama in the manner of 
the Greeks. And the scene of the Knocking at 
the Gate and the Porter's speech — a scene 
which, marvellous to say, Coleridge thought 
interpolated and offered to prove none of Shake- 
speare's — stands, with the scene of the mur- 
der of Agamemnon, at the head of all tragic 
situations in literature. More than this, * Mac- 
beth ' is Shakespeare's one mythological drama.

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



In it he strides across the borders of the visible 
world and seats himself on the ebon throne of 
Night. He summons the Parcse to his side, 
and sends them in new forms to entangle the 
wills and perplex the acts of man. Dreams and 
omens, too, he sends to shake mortal assurance. 
The piece is a miracle of art. ' Othello/ I 
think, is on an altogether lower plane. 

Almost in proportion as Mr. Wendell has 
succeeded in his interpretation of Shakespeare's 
tragic work, he has failed, or so it seems to 
me, in his criticism of the comedies of the poet's 
golden years. Some distrust of romance, some 
suspicion of joy, some fear of passion, seem 
inherent in all the New England writers. The 
glacial epoch still lingers on the banks of the 
Charles. The Puritans have an appreciation 
of all that is serious and great, but they have 
nearly as fierce a hatred of pleasure as the 
Friends. An old Quaker acquaintance of mine 
once confided to me that he had had, all his life, 
an unconquerable desire to write poetry, but 
that his religion frowned upon this as a sinful 
indulgence, and for a long time he had 
refrained. At last he came to the conclusion 
that the pains and penalties of metrical com- 
position would be a fair off-set for its pleasures, 
and he gave way to his passion. Soon, however, 
he acquired such facility in verse that there 
was no longer any penance in writing it, and 
he felt that he must stop. It occurred to him, 
then, that sonnets were a very difficult form 
of poetry, and he decided to write nothing but 
sonnets. The fatal fluency came to him again, 
and his conscience compelled him to another 
remove. From that time forth he wrote only 
sonnets in acrostic. This story is not quite 
apropos to Mr. Wendell, but it illustrates the 
antagonism which many minds feel towards art 
which is purely pleasurable. And Shakespeare's 
comedies are a palace of pleasure, — a domain 
of pure joy such as exists nowhere else in liter- 
ature. The supreme master of clouds and 
storms, the wielder of lightning and thunder, 
builds up in them a sky of pure sunshine over 
an earth of dappled shade. Matthew Arnold 
somewhere contrasts the turbid grandeur of the 
poets of the North with the clear outlines and 
pure colors of the Southern sons of song. The 
distinction is hardly a happy one. There is 
plenty of turbid grandeur, if you choose to 
call it so, in Aeschylus and Pindar, and there 
are nowhere — not the Nausicaa of Homer or 
the Syracusan women of Theocritus — figures 
outlined so clearly, colored so richly, so full 
of naive charm and studied enchantment, as the 
young girls of Shakespeare's comedies. The 
ladies of the Decameron, the heroines of Ariosto 
and Tasso, are limp and pale and spiritless 
beside the gracious guests of Arden's glade or 
Illyria's court or Belmont's garden. That our 



magician of the North should have beaten his 
Mediterranean rivals out of their own field of 
grace and beauty and delight explains the secret 
preference which many of us feel for his com- 
edies over his greater tragic work. We have the 
same feeling for them that Goethe had for Italy. 
Shakespeare's comedies are indeed the Italy of 
literature, — a sunny world wherein all our 
longings may be satisfied. 

Mr. Wendell considers that Shakespeare's last 
plays, ' Pericles,' ' Cymbeline,' ' The Winter's 
Tale,' and ' The Tempest,' show an exhaustion, 
as though the great creator's force was spent, 
his vein worked out. He supports this liiesis 
with much ingenuity, but it seems rather fanci- 
ful. When we consider the freshness of the 
pastoral scenes in ' The Winters Tale,' the 
vitality of Imogen, Shakespeare's most perfect 
woman, when we think that in one play, ' The 
Tempest,' he put his most spiritual phantasy, 
Ariel, and his most prodigious piece of absolute 
creation, Caliban, a pure anticipated cognition 
of our modern ideas of the primitive man, we 
can hardly grant any failing or falling off. 
Change of mood, change of direction, there was, 
but no declination in genius. And this leads 
us to the poignant thought that perhaps the 
latest and greatest of Shakespeare's works may 
have perished. The indifference if not hostility 
of the people by whom he was surrounded in 
Stratford, his early and unexpected death, the 
burning of New Place and his house and 
theatre in London, may have conspired to rob 
the world of the captain jewels in his carcanet. 
There was possibly an interval of five years 
between the date of Shakespeare's last known 
play and the time of his death. It is impossible 
that his mind and pen should have been idle 
during all this period. ' You might as well 
put the kettle on the fire and tell it not to boil, 
as forbid me to work,' said Scott, a much older 
and far more broken man than Shakespeare. 
Well, we shall never know, and our loss is only 
a conjectural one. 

The Prince of Conjecture in regard to Shake- 
speare is Georg Brandes. His book seems to 
me the most magnificent monument reared to 
Shakespeare since the glimpses and fragments 
of Coleridge's criticism were given to the world. 
He starts with the frank avowal of belief that 
the biography of Shakespeare can be deduced 
from the works. It is hardly to be questioned 
that the moods and emotions of a writer can to 
some extent be arrived at from his writings. 
That the outward events of a man's life are 
mirrored in his books is a more doubtful con- 
clusion. It might take us too far. A future 
historian might be forced to believe that Victor 
Hugo had served in the galleys or that Dickens 
had been imprisoned in the Marshalsea. Imag- 
ination and creative power may make an

immense show out of a small data of experience. 
It requires only a sHght obstruction to make 
an oyster secrete a pearl. Yet experience and 
obstruction there must be or you do not get the 
results. Goethe said that all his works were a 
long confession of his life. And in Shake- 
speare's case the changes of mood as his work 
progressed are beyond parallel in any other 
poet. The heights of happiness to which they 
rise, the depths of despair to which they plunge, 
the final recoil to a middle state of tolerance 
and resignation, make it all but certain that 
in a measure they reflect their author's experi- 
ence of life. Most authors are set to one tune; 
they are optimists or pessimists from the start, 
— idealists or realists. But Shakespeare starts 
with an optimism which sees a soul of goodness 
in things evil, and then wraps himself in such 
a mantle of gloom that Schopenhauer and Leo- 
pardi seem like gaudy garmented jesters beside 
him. For a time he paints only ideal pictures 
of love and truth, and then he turns to such 
descriptions of the brothels and the stews as 
Zola has hardly equalled. This revulsion of 
feeling in Shakespeare, this toppling of his 
mind almost over into madness, Brandes attrib- 
utes to three causes: his disappointment about 
women, his knowledge of the rottenness of the 
court and society about him, and the defeat of 
his ambition by unequal rivals. Brandes thinks 
that there must have come to Shakespeare at 
this period of his career a mighty feeling of 
self-confidence, the egotism of a supreme master; 
that he haughtily compared himself with the 
men outstripping him in popular acclaim in 
his own art, and with the other intellects of 
the time, — and he knew he was their master. 
All this sounds reasonable and probable enough. 
Georg Brandes's conception is not authenti- 
cated history, but better than any other it satis- 
fies our sense of what Shakespeare the man 
must have been. 

Brandes accepts Hamlet a« Shakespeare's 
personal representative among his congress of 
creations, and devotes much space to the Danish 
Prince. He makes Hamlet out the most 
accomplished figure in literature, and rather 
combats the idea that he was weak and 
undecided. He quotes, indeed, the opinion 
of another critic who claims that Hamlet 
was a magnificent man of action who did 
all he ought to have done. Really it is 
something like the case of Saladin's scimetar, 
which could not do the work of Richard's 
sword, but which, nevertheless, was a wonderful 
weapon. It has always seemed to me a great 
absurdity that we should grumble at Hamlet 
because he did not kill his Uncle before break- 
fast after his interview with the Ghost. Even 
so great a critic as Lowell wishes to displace 
Hamlet as the hero of his own story and substi- 



tute — whom? Horatio! Horatio was a per- 
fectly respectable person, who probably i-ose to 
be captain of the guard or commander of a 
Danish fishing fleet, but who, it is safe to say, 
would never have been heard of except for his 
connection with his great friend. There are 
three orders of minds in the world, — the active, 
the contemplative, and the creative. The men 
of action rush about like cheese-mites: they 
make a great bustle, but a large half of what 
they do is not worth doing. Bismarck, a typical 
man of action, confessed before his death that 
he thought he had done more harm than good 
in the world. The contemplative men really 
possess the world, but they possess it mainly 
for their own delight, and they are of little 
practical use, save as passive examples of good- 
ness. The creative minds model and remake 
mankind; in a hundred different ways they 
impress the world, and their signatures are 
stamped deeper and endure longer than thoee- 
of the men of action or affairs. To me- it, 
seems that the mind of Hamlet was distiisctly 
of the creative cast. Poet, philosopher, critic,_ 
reformer, he only needed time to blaze out a; 
prodigy. Every one around him felt his power,, 
though his modesty disguised or distrusted itt 
The eternal thing in Shakespeare's play is that 
it is the biography of a young genius. His;; 
hesitation in taking his revenge was mainly due- 
to his inexperience and his too great nobility. 
A huffing captain in one of Dumas's novels 
utters a sentence which is the key to Hamlet's 
original irresolution. The bully is talking to 
a young gentleman who draws back from a 
certain enterprise because his conscience would 
be compromised therein, and he tells him, ' The- 
man who cannot lie, cannot act.' Haralet is 
so constituted that a lie is almost death to him,, 
and when he sees the necessity of fighting the- 
world with its own weapons he is awkward and' 
stumbling in the extreme. But he becomes 
stronger in worldliness as he goes on, and he- 
ends in a whirlwind of revenge. 

To turn from Georg Brandes to Mr. Sidney 
Lee is to descend from art to business. It is 
like leaving a theatre where ' Parsifal ' has been- 
performed and going out into the garish, brawl- 
ing street. It is like riding one moment through 
the air with Phaethon in his fiery chariot, and 
the next bumping along the ground or being 
ducked in the cold waters of the sea. As a 
compendium of the known facts about Shake- 
speare and his surroundings the book is admir- 
able; learning, industry, and talent make it a 
work not to be superseded. As a study of a 
great poet it is, to speak frankly, deplorable- 
Mr. Lee treats Shakespeare much as thoug'h 
the poet had been a manufacturer of woolen 
yams in Lancashire or a breeder of prize sheep- 
on the Cotswolds. Among a good many recent

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



English critics there is a tendency towards 
prosaic views of literary idols, a disposition to 
take them down a peg. This attitude is very 
apparent in the work of Sir Leslie Stephen. It 
is apparent in a good deal of Mr, Morley's 
criticism. It was largely the stock in trade of 
the brilliant Bagehot. And to a certain extent 
it is justifiable and necessary. At a time when 
the literature of the nineteenth century was 
largely becoming, in Freeman's phreise, ' chatter 
about Harriet/ such a reaction was a healthy 
sign. But it has probably gone far enough, and 
•ought never to have been applied to Shake- 
speare. Mr. Lee's biography is largely on the 
lines of Bagehofs clever but quite Philistine 
•essay on Shakespeare. It was well enough to 
prove that the poet was a good man of business, 
'but it was hardly worth while to give the 
impression that he was nothing else. Mr. Lee 
strips Shakespeare of all the glamor that legend 
•or conjecture have raised around him. He 
reduces him personally to the least dimensions. 
Even in utterly unimportant matters he insists 
•on the lowest terms. For instance, Brandes, 
^following Knight, makes the young Shakespeare 
.ride up to London and there sell his horse. Mr. 
Lee says he walked. How does he know? If, 
.as tradition holds, his first employment in Lon- 
don had to do with horses, Brandes' story is 
more likely to be right. 

One of the most acute and erudite chapters 
in Mr. Lee's study has to do with the sonnets. 
His deduction that they are mainly or largely 
imaginative and impersonal is unconvincing. 
It is much the same question as to whether 
Shakespeare put his experience into the plays; 
and the judgment must be the same, — that of 
course he did. The events in both cases may 
ibe imaginary, but the mood is real. Mr. Lee 
also decides that the ' Mr. W. H.' of Thomas 
Thorpe's dedication was only the collector of 
the sonnets, not the inspirer. Why the pub- 
lisher should have wished the mere gatherer-up 
of manuscript poems the 'immortality promised 
by our ever-living poet ' is unexplained. In all 
the discussions of the sonnets I cannot recall 
that any critic has ever noted their immense 
'disparity in literary merit. There are, I should 
-say, about fifty-five of them of great excellence, 
tmany of which are supreme stars in our sonnet 
literature. The remaining hundred or so are 
mot above the level of the mass of Elizabethan 
fionneteering. Such a disproportion of bad to 
good exists in no other admitted work of Shake- 
speare, and I am inclined to think that whoever 
gathered the sonnets together swept in a number 
written by other hands. This very thing hap- 
pened in more tlian one publication given forth 
under Shakespeare's name, and why not in the 
.<;ase of the sonnets?

COMMUNICA TION. 



LIONEL JOHNSON: A PROPOSED MEMORIAL. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

'One felt for him something of the tenderness 
with which Charles Lamb was regarded by his 
friends.' Thus wrote Mrs. Katharine Tynan 
Hinkson, of our lost and chivalrie poet, Lionel 
Johnson. And again, 'He was to the last Saint 
Lionel, with the qualities that made us think 
of him by that name . . A shadowy gentle 
presence that was of us, yet not of us.' 

Whoever will possess himself of Lionel John- 
son's two choice volumes, 'Poems' (1895) and 
'Ireland, with Other Poems' (1897), will come 
into friendship with a poet whose work is marked 
by singular beauty and elevation. The mar- 
moreal dignity of the Roman muse, the yearn- 
ing wild Celtic melody,— these were his in equal 

measure. 

' Magnificence and grace. 

Excellent courtesy ; 
A brightness in ttie face, 

Airs of high memory; 
Whence came all these to such as he?' 

Whether he sang of dear Ireland's haunting 
sorrows, or of Ireland's holy memories, he pic- 
tured her ever as a land of visions, of enchant- 
ment and old voices, a land fulfilled of the glory 
of things eternal. Lovely melancholy broods 
over all his more solemn song,— and every song 
of his to Ireland the beloved is of a rich solem- 
nity. 

' Tears for the dear and dead! For thee, All hail! 

Unconquered Inisfail! 
Tears for the lost ; thou livest, O divine ! ' 

Were I to set down here a jitst measure of 
Johnson's poetry in honor of his two collegiate 
homes, I should far overpass the limits allowed 
me. Let a stanza or two from his 'Oxford,' then, 
suffice : 

' That is the Oxford, strong to charm us yet: 
Eternal In her beauty and her past. 

What, though her soul be vexed? She can forget 
Cares of an hour ; only the great things last. 

' Only the gracious air, only the charm, 
And ancient might of true humanities : 

These, nor assault of man, nor time, can harm; 
Not these, nor Oxford with her memories. 

' Think of her so! the -wonderful, the fair, 

The immemorial, and the ever young: 
The city, sweet with our forefathers' care ; 

The city, where the Muses all have sung.' 
Lionel Johnson's early death, in 1902, took 
from us a poet of strangely rich promise. The 
pathos of his unfulfilled renown will surely lin- 
ger around his memory 'like odors of old roses.' 
In the cloisters of his old School at Winchester 
the little band of his friends hope to place a 
tablet of brass and dark marble, in Lionel John- 
son's memory. Miss Louise Imogen Guiney has 
asked me to receive subscriptions from Ameri- 
can admirers. If any desire to aid, they may 
kindly send contributions to Mrs. Henry Hink- 
son, 9 Longfield Road, Ealing, London, W.; or 
they may send to me, and I shall promptly 
acknowledge and forward as received.

More Bu sKiy I iEtters.* 

ISTot even * Praeterita ' or ' Fors ' brings the 
reader into so intimate contact with Ruskin as 
do his letters to Professor Charles Eliot Nor- 
ton, which now, edited and annotated by Mr. 
^N^orton, and enriched with illustrations and 
facsimiles, are published in two handsome 
Tolumes. As the editor says in his preface, 
'' No other series of his letters extended 
oinbroken over so long a term of years, or was 
likely to possess so much autobiographical 
interest, — comparatively little, indeed, as a 
Tecord of events, but much as a record of moods 
and mental conditions. As a picture of char- 
acter the letters as a whole were unique.' Selec- 
tion and excision have of course been necessary ; 
■but the series as published extends, with no 
wide gaps, from the beginning of this long and 
•close friendship in 1855 down to 1887, when 
Ruskin's failing health brought his letter-writ- 
ing practically to an end. Beginning where 
'* Praeterita ' leaves off, the letters form a sort of 
-sequel to that unique autobiography. 

To those not already pretty familiar with 
Ruskin's peculiarities these letters must bring 
some disillusion, along with delight at theii 
marvellouis display of varied and brilliant 
■attainments. The only child of fondly devoted 
parents, and a child of genius at the same time, 
Ruskin was reared and educated in such a way 
as to foster those qualities of impulsiveness 
and unrestraint and emphatic self-assertion 
which are so manifest in his writings. Together 
"with a few instances of admirable reticence, we 
have in his letters many less praiseworthy 
jieldings to whim and impulse and the annoy- 
ance of the moment. Yet if it be desirable to 
know the truth and the whole truth about a 
famous man, to have in very fact the real Rus- 
kin before us, perhaps this prodigality of self- 
revealment is not to be regretted, especially 
-since by no means the least conspicuous trait 
■disclosed is the beautiful craving for human 
love and sympathy which it seemed his destiny 
-never to be able to satisfy. Remarkable indeed 
is the quickness of cordial welcome with which 
Ruskin at thirty-eight opened his heart to the 
young American stranger, nine years his junior, 
in that autumn of 1855 when Mr. Norton 
sought him out. In a surprisingly brief space 
-the formal ' My dear Sir ' of the Englishman's 
first letter gave place to 'Dear Norton,' while 
this in turn changed with better acquaintance 
to 'My dear Charles,' 'My dearest Charles,' 

* Letters op John Ruskin to Charles Eliot Nor- 
ton. In two volumes. Illustrated. Boston : Houghton, 
Mifflin & Co. 



and at last 'My darling Charles.' Through a 
similar ascending scale of warmth do the letter- 
endings rapidly pass, — 'Very truly yours/ 
'Yours affectionately,' and so on, up to 'Ever 
your lovingest J. R.' So little of the tj^ical 
Briton's armor of shy reserve did Ruskin wear. 

Our first quotation shall be from the editor's 
description of a small dinner party at Den- 
mark Hill, the Ruskin homestead. 

'Another topic of the after-dinner talk was Emer- 
son's "English Traits," which was then a new 
book. All praised it. "How did he come to find 
out so much about us?" said the elder Mr. Euskin, 
"especially as regards matters on which we 
keep quiet and are reserved among ourselves." 
That was the voice of the generation to 
which Mr. Euskin belonged. His son, speak- 
ing for himself and for his generation, would 
hardly have used the like terms. One of the great 
changes in England during the nineteenth century 
was the breaking down of many of the old-style 
walls within which the shy Englishman was wont 
to entrench himself, and no English writer ever 
opened himself and his life to the public with more 
complete and indiscreet reserve than Euskin. His 
father would have been horrified could he in the 
days of which I am writing have foreseen the 
revelations of "Fors" and "Praeterita." They do, 
indeed, form a contrast which is both humorous and 
pathetic to the close reserves of Denmark Hill, and 
to the strict Anglican conventions, at their best so 
pleasant and so worthy of respect, in accordance to 
which life was there conducted.' 

A few letters from the elder Ruskin are 
included in the collection, and they have an 
old-fashioned courtesy and formality about 
them that not only make them pleasant read- 
ing, but that place them in the sharpest con- 
trast with the son's unchecked outpourings. 
The stately and awe-inspiring mother also 
comes to view now and then, and the wonder 
grows that such a son was ever born of such 
parents. 

A letter of Ruskin's written in December, 
1856, is amusingly illustrative of his fondness 
for page-long sentences. It is also amusing in 
other respects. Note the 'candour and reflec- 
tive charity' with which he speaks of Rome, 
his one early visit to which had been at a time 
of ill health. 

'Seasoning with myself in the severest way, and 
checking whatever malice against the things I have 
injured, or envy of you, there may be in the feel- 
ings with which I now think of Eome, these appear 
to me incontrovertible and accurate conclusions, — 
that the streets are damp and mouldy where they 
are not burning; that the modern architecture is 
fit only to put on a Twelfth cake in sugar (e, g. 
the churches at the Quattro Fontane); that the old 
architecture consists chiefly of heaps of tufo and 
bricks; that the Tiber is muddy; that the fountains 
are fantastic; that the Castle of St. Angelo is too 
round; that the Capitol is too square; that St. 
Peter's is too big; that all the other churches are 
too little; that the Jews' quarter is uncomfortable; 
that the English quarter is unpicturesque; that 
Michael Angelo 's Moses is a monster; that his Last 
Judgment is a mistake; that Eaphael's Transfigiira-

tion is a failure; that Apollo Belvidere is a public 
nuisance; that the bills are high; the malaria 
strong; the dissipation shameful; the bad company 
numerous; the Sirocco depressing; the Tramontana 
chilling; the Levante parching; the Ponente pelt- 
ing; the ground unsafe; the politics perilous. I do 
think^ that in all candour and reflective charity, I 
may assert this much.' 

That Ruskin would persist, despite his physi- 
cian's warnings, in burning his candle at both 
ends and at several intermediate points, is well 
kno^vn. Here is a passage depicting his rest- 
less industry : 

'I am tormented by what I cannot get said, nor 
done. I want to get all the Titians, Tintorets, Paul 
Veroneses, Turners, and Sir Joshuas in the world 
into one great fire proof Gothic gallery of marble 
and serpentine. I want to get them all perfectly 
engraved. I want to go and draw all the subjects 
of Turner's 19,000 sketches in Switzerland and 
Italy, elaborated by myself. I want to get every- 
body a dinner who hasn't got one. I want to 
macadamize some new roads to Heaven with broken 
fools '-heads. I want to hang up some knaves out 
of the way, not that I've any dislike to them, but 
I think it would be wholesome for them, and for 
other people, and that they would make good crow 's 
meat. I want to play all day long and arrange my 
cabinet of minerals with new white wool. I want 
somebody to amuse me when I'm tired. I want 
Turner's pictures not to fade. . . . Farther, I 
want to make the Italians industrious, the Ameri- 
cans quiet, the Swiss romantic, the Roman Catholics 
rational, and the English Parliament honest — and I 
can 't do anything and don 't understand what I was 
born for. I get melaacholy — overeat myself, over- 
sleep myself — get pains in the back — don't know 
what to do in any wise.' 

Surely few good men have ever been so 
relentlessly pursued by the demon of unrest. It 
is probable that his disappointments in love, 
Avhich are frankly referred to in his letters, had 
much to do with his urgent need of occupation. 
Interesting in this connection is the following 
paragraph : 

'As for things that have influenced me, I believe 
hard work, love of justice and of beauty, good 
nature and great vanity, have done all of me that 
was worth doing. I've had my heart broken, ages 
ago, when I was a boy — then mended, cracked, 
beaten in, kicked about old corridors, and finally, I 
think, flattened fairly out. I've picked up what 
education I've got in an irregular way — and it's 
very little. I suppose that on the whole as little 
has been got into me and out of me as under any 
circumstances was probable; it is true, had my 
father made me his clerk I might have been in a 
fair way of becoming a respectable Political Econo- 
mist in the manner of R'icardo or Mill — ^but grant- 
ing liberty and power of travelling, and working as 
I chose, I suppose everything I've chosen to have 
been about as wrong as wrong could be.' 

As characteristic of the multiplicity of his 
interests and affinities, and as illustrating the 
perpetual youthfulness of genius, may be men- 
tioned his announcement, at fifty, that he is 
taking music lessons. ' I am learning,' he says, 
'how to play musical scales quite rightly, and 
have a real Music-master twice a week, and 



practice always half an hour a day.' This is 
from a letter enumerating ten different things 
he is busy with, one of them being the writing 
of a course of lectures to be delivered at Oxford. 
The absorbing interest he took in political 
economy, in the hope of bringing to pass better 
things in his own and in other countries, 
claimed more and more of his time and 
strength, and incidentally moved him to cry 
out in a sort of Carlylean rage at those whom 
he conceived to be inculcating error in this 
department. 

'But when I accuse Mill of being the root of all 
immediate evil among us in England, I am in earn- 
est — the man being looked up to as "the greatest 
thinker" when he is in truth an utterly shallow 
and wretched segment of a human creature, incapa- 
ble of understanding Anything in the ultimate con- 
ditions of it, and countenancing with unhappy for- 
tune, whatever is fatallest in the popular error of 
English mind. I want you to look a little at the 
really great statements of Economical principle 
made by the true Men of all time; and you will 
gradually feel what deadly cast skin of the car- 
casses of every error they abhorred, modern 
"Economists" have patched up their hide with.' 

Referring to the talk raised by his deliverances 
on this subject, he declares that he does not 
care two straws what people think of him after 
he is dead, but that he does care very much 
what is said of him while alive; and he begs 
his correspondent to do all in his power to allay 
the continual provocation he receives from the 
universal assumption that he knows nothing' 
about political economy and is a fool for open- 
ing his mouth on the subject. A letter written 
soon after the Carlyle-Emerson correspondence 
appeared has the following: 

'It has been a great mortification and disappoint- 
ment to me not to see S. again; but the world's 
made up of morts and disses, and it 's no use always 
saying "Ay de mi!" like Carlyle. I'm really 
ashamed of him in those letters to Emerson. My 
own diaries are indeed full of mewing and moan- 
ing, all to myself, but I think my letters to friends 
have more a tendency to crowing, or, at least, on 
the whole, try to be pleasant.' 

Thus incorrectly do we picture to ourselves the 
impression we make on others. But with all 
Ruskin's indulgence in a sort of lovable petu- 
lance, he now and then, perhaps to humor a 
mere whim, is noticeably reticent. One likes 
his saying nothing at all about his appointment 
to the Oxford professorship, and nothing about 
his election as Lord Rector of St. Andrews, in 
letters that might well have dealt with little 
else. 

Ruskin's admiration for Lowell is enthusias- 
tic but not uncritical. Referring to Lowell's 
essay on Dante, he calls it very good ; ' hut/ 
he adds, Hhe entire school of you moderns 
judge hopelessly out, of these older ones, because 
you never admit the possibility of their know- 
ing what we don't. The moment you take that

all-knowing attitude, the heavens are veiled. 
Lowell speaks of Dante as if Dante were a for- 
ward schoolboy, and Lowell his master.' Strong 
as was Buskin's liking'for some of Mr. Nor- 
ton's American friends, he could not, during 
our Civil War, which horrified and sickened 
him, find much that was good in things or per- 
sons American. His utter lack of sympathy 
with either the union cause or the anti-slavery 
cause, was remarkable, but of course not pecu- 
liar to him among Englishmen. 

Another literary criticism is worth quoting. 
Ruskin says of Dickens's death, that ' the liter- 
ary loss is infinite/ but very frankly adds, — 

'Dickens was a pure modernist — a leader of the 
steam-whistle party par excellence — and he had no 
understanding of any power of antiquity except a 
sort of jackdaw sentiment for cathedral towers. He 
knew nothing of the nobler power of superstition 
— was essentially a stage manager, and used every- 
thing for effect on the pit. His Christmas meant 
mistletoe and pudding — neither resurrection from 
dead, nor rising of new stars, nor teaching of wise 
men, nor shepherds. His hero is essentially the 
iron-master; in spite of "Hard times," he has 
advanced by his influence every principle that 
makes them harder — the love of excitement, in all 
classes, and the fury of business competition, and 
the distrust both of nobility and clergy which, wide 
enough and fatal enough, and too justly founded, 
needed no apostle to the mob, but a grave teacher 
of priests and nobles themselves, for whom Dickens 
had essentially no word.' 

These two men were of widely dissimilar 
genius. ' It is my stern desire,' declares Rus- 
kin, * to get at the pure fact and nothing less 
or more, which gives me whatever power I have ; 
it is Dickens's delight in grotesque exaggera- 
tion which has made him, I think, nearly use- 
less in the present day.' 

From 1868 to 1873 Mr. Norton sojourned in 
Europe mth his family, some months of the 
time in England and near Ruskin. Frequent 
letters and much personal intercourse make 
this a fruitful period for Mr. Norton's volumes. 
Several letters from Ruskin to Mrs. Norton 
form one of the pleasant accompaniments of 
this visit. Among noteworthy events is a meet- 
ing between Darwin and Ruskin at the Norton's 
temporary home in Kent. 

'The contrast between them was complete, and 
•each in his own way was unique and delightful. 
Buskin's gracious courtesy was matched by Dar- 
win's charming and genial simplicity. Buskin was 
full of questions which interested the elder natur- 
alist by the keenness of observation and the variety 
of scientific attainment which they indicated, and 
their animated talk afforded striking illustration of 
the many sympathies that underlay the divergence 
of their points of view, and of their methods of 
thought. The next morning Darwin rode over on 
horseback to say a pleasant word about Ruskin 
and two days afterward Euskin wrote, "Mr. Dar- 
win was delightful." ' 

The editor is apparently in error when he calls 
this the first meeting; for Ruskin himself has 



told us, in ' Praeterita ' or elsewhere, that he 
met Darwin at Dr. Buckland's in his (Rus- 
kin's) undergraduate days at Oxford. * He, and 
I got on together and- talked all the evening* 
is his record of the meeting. 

As volume two draws to a close we note with 
sadness the coming on of Ruskin's infirmities, 
bodily and mental. The editor has probably 
spared us still further pain by large omissions 
from the latter part of the correspondence, and 
by publishing no scrap of it whatever for the 
last dozen years of Ruskin's life. ' Taken all 
together,' as Mr. Norton says of the entire 
series of letters, ' they form a tragic record 
of the perplexities of a great and generous soul, 
the troubles of a tender heart, the spendthrift 
use and at last the failure of exceptional 
powers. Such genius, such high aim, such 
ardent yet often ill-directed effort, and such 
great yet broken achievement, such splendors 
sinking into such glooms, — it is a sorrowful

Italian Country Houses.* 



On first acquaintance the Italian villa does 
not, as a rule, appeal to the taste of the Amer- 
ican. He is disappointed to find the house 
built up close to the highway instead of being 
approached by wide pathways and drives; in 
the garden, he misses the large flower-beds and 
expanses of green lawn to which he has been 
accustomed, he resents the primness and for- 
mality of outline, the pebbly walks, the arti- 
ficial cut of trees and hedges, the absence of 
everything wild, the presence of arrangement 
everywhere. But, before very long, becoming 
accustomed to the Italian climate and to Italian 
ways of living, he begins to realize that both 
house and garden have a rationale of their own, 
that there is a logic behind all their forms and 
features, and that what at first had seemed 
senseless is really the product of high art com- 
bining, as all sound art must, logic and beauty 
into a harmonious whole. 

The logic of the American garden is to fur- 
nish an agreeable outlook from the house win- 
dows or the street; the logic of the Italian gar- 
den is that it is a place to live in, — as a matter 
of fact it is lived in more than the house for 
months at a time. Therefore, the grounds are 
as carefully and conveniently planned as the 
house, with broad paths where two or more can 
walk abreast leading from one division to 
another; with shade for summer and sunny 
sheltered walks for winter easily accessible

from the house; with terraces and formal gar- 
dens in the foregi'ound from which lead ilex 
or laurel walks, clipped into shape in order to 
effect a transition between the straight lines 
of masonry and the untrimmed growth of the 
outlying woodland. Thus each step away from 
architecture brings a nearer approach to nature. 
Moreover, if the surrounding landscape be of 
the grand type, the artist has probably broad- 
ened and simplified his plan. Intricacy of 
detail, complicated groupings of terraces, foun- 
tains, labyrintlis, and porticoes are found in 
sites where there is no great sweep of land- 
scape attuning the eye to larger impressions. 
Where landscapes are the least grand, as in 
northern Italy, gardens are the most elaborate. 
The great pleasure-grounds overlooking the 
Eoman Campagna, on the contrary, are laid 
out on severe and majestic lines; the parts are 
few, and the total effect is one of breadth and 
simplicity. And everywhere the climaite of 
Italy combines with the artist to effect a gradual 
blending of nature and architecture by covering 
its bronze and stone and marble with an 
exquisite coloring of time, the patina which 
can neither be imitated nor acquired in any 
other land or in, any other way. Even the 
unromantic site of the house on the high road 
is forgiven after one lives a while in an Italian 
villa and finds how thoroughly this secures to 
his private use the full extent of the grounds 
when no space has had to be sacrificed for the 
sake of a public approach to the house. 

Such, then, are the typical excellencies of 
the old Italian garden : free circulation of sun- 
light and air about the house, abundance of 
water, easy access to dense shade, sheltered 
walks with different points of view, variety of 
effect produced by the skilful use of different 
levels, and, finally, breadth and simplicity of 
composition. Utility is at the foundation, but 
an artistic race can never content itself with 
mere utility, and aesthetic emotions are as neces- 
sary as breathing to the life of the Italian. 
The effect of passing from the sunny fruit- 
garden to the dense grove, thence to the wide- 
reaching view, and again to the sheltered pri- 
vacy of the pleached walk or the mossy coolness 
of the grotto, — all these were taken into 
account by the old artists who, centuries ago, 
studied the contrast of assthetic emotions as 
keenly as they did the juxtaposition of dark 
cypress and pale lemon-tree, of deep shade and 
level sunlight. Moreover, their designs were 
based on a principle exactly the reverse of our 
own. Whereas the modem gardener's one idea 
of producing an effect of space is to annihilate 
boundaries, and to blend a vague whole with the 
landscape in general, the old garden-architect 
proceeded on the opposite principle, arguing 
that as a house containing a single huge room 



would be less interesting and less serviceable 
than one divided according to the varied 
requirements of its inmates, so also a garden 
which consists of merely one huge outdoor room 
is less interesting and less serviceable than one 
which has its logical divisions. 

The American who stops long enough in 
Italy is sure, sooner or later, to come under the 
spell of the Italian villas and their gardens, 
and -he who began by scoffing ends by praising. 
On some fair day, as he wanders under the 
umbrella pines of the Villa Borghese, or prom- 
enades the terraces of the Villa Medici, be 
yields to the garden-magic and ever after hi& 
bondage is complete. 

But how shall he explain it? Who wiH 
understand him in his native land ? Why does 
he like these stiff and ugly things that he 
exhibits in photograph? Analysis of impres- 
sions, especially of aesthetic impressions, i& 
always a thankless task and requires genius of 
a peculiar kind. 

Mrs. Edith Wharton, in writing of ' Italian 
Villas and their Gardens,' and Mr. Maxfield 
Parrish by his pictures of them, have produced! 
a book analytic enough to satisfy the most 
exacting mind and beautiful enough to content 
the most artistic taste. Mrs. Wharton is one 
who, having fallen under the ineffable spell of 
the Italian garden-magic, has found it ' more 
potent, more enduring, more intoxicating to 
every sense than the most elaborate and glowing 
effects of modem horticulture,' and she can also 
tell us why. She has analyzed the secret of the 
charm, and shows us that it is because the great 
object of all landscape gardening — the fusion 
of nature and art — has never been so success- 
fully accomplished as in the treatment of the 
Italian country-house from the beginning of 
the sixteenth century to the end of the eight- 
eenth. Indeed, next to sitting on a marble 
bench and watching the play of light and shade 
among the trees and statues of an Italian 
garden for oneself, is the pleasure of reading 
about it in this book. Who that has availed 
himself of the Wednesday afternoon privilege 
of rambling in the grounds of the Villa Medici 
at Rome, will not feel .himself again transported 
there by Mrs. Wharton's description? 

'It is not necessary to be a student of garden- 
architecture to feel the spell of quiet and serenity 
which falls on one at the very gateway; but it i» 
worth the student's while to try to analyze the ele- 
ments of which the sensation is composed. Per- 
haps they will be found to resolve themselves into 
diversity, simplicity, fitness. The plan of the gar- 
den is simple, but its different parts are so con- 
trasted as to produce, by the fewest means, a pleas- 
ant sense of variety without sacrifice of repose.

with their effect of uniformity and repose, one

house-front are harmonized by a strong predomi- 
nance of architectural lines, and by the beautiful 
lateral loggia, with niches for statues, above which 
the upper ilex-wood rises. Tall hedges and trees 
there are none; for from the villa one looks across 
the garden at the wide sweep of the Campagna and 
the mountains; indeed, this is probably one of the 
first of the gardens which Gurlitt defines as "gar- 
dens to look out from" in contradistinction to the 
earlier sort, "gardens to look into." Mounting to 
the terrace, one comes to the third division of the 
garden, the wild-wood with its irregular levels, 
through which a path leads to the mount, with a 
little temple on its summit. This is a rare feature 
in Italian grounds; in hilly Italy there was small 
need of creating the artificial hillocks so much 
esteemed in the old English gardens. In this case, 
however, the mount justifies its existence, for it 
affords a wonderful view over the other side of 
Rome and the Campagna.' 

In other chapters, we get similar sympa- 
thetic descriptions of the villas of Florence, of 
Siena, of Genoa, of Lombardy, Venetia, and 
other regions. 

The cult of the Italian garden in America 
has hardly progressed further than an attempt 
to introduce Italian ' effects ' by placing a mar- 
ble bench here, a sun-dial there, and statues 
numerous. But it is not thus that we shall 
bring the old garden magic into our own 
garden patches. What will help us is to improve 
OUT opportunities for studying the old garden 
craft, which had for its aim to make a garden 
adapted to the uses for which it was to be put. 
Thus may we bring into our landscape and 
our age not indeed the Italian garden itself, 
but the informing spirit which told those men 
of old that house, garden and landscape must 
each be planned with reference to the other 
and blended into one harmonious whole ; which 
taught them how with simple materials and in 
a limited space they might give, impressions of 
distance and sensations of the unexpected for 
which one now looks in vain outside of Italy. 

The pictures, many of them in color, are of 
uncommon beauty and charm; while cover 
design and mechanical features throughout 
make the volume one of great distinction even 
at this time when publishers are vying with 
each other as never before in the elegance of 
their output. Anna Benneson McMahan.

The Autobiography of Justist 
McCarthy.* 

Mr. Justin McCarthy's life has been one of 
such varied interests and broad experience as 
to warrant the expectation that his autobiog- 
raphy would include scenes and incidents 
attractive to a wide circle of readers. Born 
near the city of Cork, in Ir eland, his youth was 

* An Irishman's Story. By Justin McCarthy. New 
York: The Macmillan Co. 



spent in an atmosphere which was heavily 
charged with literary aspiration, and in which 
the pressure of genteel poverty acted as a spur 
to endeavor. It was family poverty that turned 
him from law to journalism as a profession. 
Beginning as a reporter for the * Cork Exam- 
iner' in 1848, his first newspaper work was 
connected with the stories of suffering endured 
during the years of the great famine, and with 
the rebellion that followed. From this he 
gained a close and sympathetic understanding of 
political and social conditions in his native 
country, and grew into touch with the acknowl- 
edged leaders of Irish thought. But his ambi- 
tion had always been to see for himself, and 
to be a part of, the intense journalistic life of 
London; and he welcomed an offer of a place 
on a Liverpool paper as a step in that direc- 
tion. Finally, in 1860, he secured a place on 
the ' Morning Star,' a Radical London journal, 
at that time controlled and guided by John 
Bright. This brought acquaintance with that 
element in English politics which best under- 
stood conditions in America, and stood for a 
distinctly friendly attitude toward the North in 
our Civil War. The influence of Bright in this 
connection is unmistakeable in the writings of 
Mr. McCarthy at this period, and in his 
speeches in America at a later date. Mean- 
while, he was growing in power in newspaper 
work, making more or less successful experi- 
ments in the production of novels and histories, 
and becoming thoroughly familiar with politics 
and politicians by reason of his duties as a 
reporter of debates in the House of Commons. 
In 1868 he came to America, where he was 
already known as a writer of short stories and 
as a literary critic, but came primarily to seek 
a lecture-field and a wider public for his books. 
Throughout all this period he had been a quiet 
though untiring worker in the cause of Irish 
independence, though without much hope of 
any immediate betterment of the situation. But 
in 1871 he thought conditions were ripe for 
the adoption of a definite policy by Irish 
Nationalists; and, setting aside the attractive 
idea of American citizenship, he returned to 
England to throw himself heart and soul into 
what was for him the one great patriotic cause. 
He was welcomed by the leaders of his party, 
and in 1873 became a member of Parliament 
for the Irish constituency of Longford, soon 
being elected vice-chairman of the party of 
which Parnell was the head, bearing his share 
of the burden of those tactics of obstruction 
adopted by Parnell as the only means of forcing 
English attention to Irish grievances, devoting 
his pen to the service of the cause, and mean- 
while earning the means of support for himself 
and his family by all sorts of literary produc-- 
tions. Later he became the personal represen-

tative of Gladstx)iie, when the latter attempted 
to force Parnell into a temporary abdication of 
leadership — the result of the scandal aroused 
by the Parnell divorce suit; and upon Parnell's 
refusal to retire, he was chosen chairman of 
that majority of the Irish party which thought 
the only hope of Ireland lay in acquiescence to 
the will of the great leader of the liberal party. 
The succeeding years inflicted on Mr. McCarthy 
the unhappiness of being personally engaged in 
the bitter political quarrels of his native coun- 
try, and of seeing many of the strong ties of 
long friendship severed by political animosities. 
Ultimately, ill-health drove him from political 
life; and since 1897 he has given his whole time 
to such literary labor as has been possible under 
the infliction of a partial loss of sight, serious 
enough to forbid any work whether of reading 
or writing without the aid of an amanuensis. 

This bare outline of a wonderfully interest- 
ing and useful life indicates the principal topics 
upon which Mr. McCarthy has touched in his 
autobiography. From whatever aspect this life 
is considered, whether in the light of literary 
acquaintance in both England and America, or 
of social conditions in Ireland, or of political 
conditions in England, enough material existed 
for a vividly illuminative and wholly entertain- 
ing work. Mr. McCarthy had, as a part of his 
equipment for the field of journalism, an unu- 
sually attractive personality, pleasing manners, 
and a happy ability in social conversation. He 
also came to be trusted for the unvarying kind- 
ness of his judgments, and for his desire to 
avoid wounding the sensibilities of others. It 
followed that wherever he went or lived, he was 
welcomed by men in all walks of life, and was 
entrusted with secret motives and purposes to 
an extent enjoyed by few other men of his time. 
His readers will therefore expect intimate char- 
acterizations of men famous in the literary or 
the political world, and details of the inner 
workings of Irish associations and English 
politics. But here is a genuine disappointment ; 
for Mr. McCarthy has carefully refrained from 
anytliing like intimate description or details. 
Possibly, and conceivably, it is a very delicate 
undertaking for a man to permit the publica- 
tion, during his life-time, of writings unravel- 
ling concealed political manoeuvres, or indulg- 
ing in honest and fearless criticism; and pos- 
sibly also Mr. McCarthy might urge that the 
public should be interested in his own life, 
when he tells it, and not demand careful analy- 
sis of other men's acts and books. But the 
fact remains that he has been so extremely 
good-natured in his treatment of personalities 
as to deny to his work any suggestion of that 
intimate knowledge which its author undoubt- 
^y possesses. 



There is such a thing as carrying good-nature 
and kindness of treatment too far. The result 
in the present work is to make it easy to chal- 
lenge the soundness of the author's judgments ; 
and in truth his judgments, by their very gen- 
erosity, are provocative of such challenge. Hif! 
comments, whether of men or of events, can 
be designated by no other term than ' scrappy,' 
with the unfortunate result that the pages 
devoted to comparatively unimportant events in 
his own life seem wasted, when topics of ex- 
treme interest in the literary or political world 
are but hastily summarized. In the course of 
his story over a hundred and fifty names are 
briefly mentioned, of persons in the dramatic, 
literary, or political world, with whom Mr. 
McCarthy claims acquaintance. With most of 
these he could have had no more than acquaint- 
ance. How much more satisfactory would have 
been a careful even though wholly kindly 
account of the few whom he knew with suffi- 
cient intimacy to render his estimate worth 
consideration. 

Such a mere enumeration of notables might 
seem an evidence of egotism on the part of the 
author; but this is certainly not the case, for if 
egotism were the cause of this lack of discrim- 
ination it would be manifested by a self -lauda- 
tory history of services rendered to the cause 
of Irish nationalism and to literature. Far 
from offering such a history, he is here also 
brief and disinclined to expand upon his own 
labors. Now, Mr. McCarthy has met with vari- 
ous judgments from critics and historians as to 
the merits of his writings, but of his genuine 
service to the cause of Ireland there can be but 
one opinion. He has stood forward as a pure, 
high-minded Irish patriot, pursuring honest 
and upright methods in politics, steadily 
devoted to an ideal form of government for 
his beloved island. He has been able and vig- 
orous, a real help to the cause; and has been 
closely in touch with all the movements of 
the last twenty-five years in both English and 
Irish politics. Why then could he not have told 
us more of himself, of the causes of things, of 
the characters of the men engaged with him 
or opposed to him in the pursuit of that high 
ideal — in fine, more of the actual political life 
and labors of Mr. Justin McCarthy? This 
would not have been regarded as an evidence of 
egotism, save by the hypercritical ; for the repu- 
tation of Mr. McCarthy will survive, not as an 
author and critic, but as a worker in the cause 
of Irish nationalism, and he has a right to tell 
his story in this connection at any length he 
pleases. It is to be hoped that for the sake 
of historical knowledge, if for no other reason, 
he will still find strength and inclination to 
attempt this task. E. D. Adams.

The IjAtest History of America.* 

The first volume of Messrs. Chancellor and 
Hewes's ' The United States : A History of 
Three Centuries' presents a pleasing appear- 
ance. With an attractive binding, with clear 
print, and with many novel and sometimes use- 
ful little maps to illustrate the text, the gen- 
eral impression is inviting. One notes favor- 
ably, also, the plan of the work, and especially 
the division of each volume into four sections, 
which treat respectively of ' Population and 
Politics/ ^War and Conquest,' 'Industry and 
Commerce,' and ' Civilization.' The work is Lo 
be complete in ten parts, each of which will be 
a unit and will be sold separately. 

Unfortunately, notwithstanding the large 
promises of the ' Publisher's Announcement * 
prefixed to tliis volume, there is much to crit- 
icize with reference to the execution of the 
work. One of the authors, we are told, 'has 
for a series of years [sic] been accepted as a 
leading authority in the department of statis- 
tical and economic history ' ; and the other's 
* clear-cut and vigorous style, his dramatic and 
picturesque presentation of events, and his 
critical and discriminating characterization of 
the men about whom American history has 
been shaped and whose careers are themselves a 
large factor in such history, will serve to give 
to readers who are already familiar with the 
subject fresh interest in it; while the younger 
readers of the later generation will, it is be- 
lieved, secure from this history information 
and interest not to be found in any other single 
work.' 

Without attempting to controvert these posi- 
tive assertions as to the merits of the authors, 
we may accept the last statement, though 
hardly in the sense intended. Certainly the 
'3'ounger readers' will find here much infor- 
mation, if not interest, 'not to be found 
in any other single work.' Let us take, for 
example, these statements as to the Funda- 
mental Constitutions of Carolina, ])age 285 : 

*In 1669 the "unalterable Constitutions" were 
begun. These were devised by the Earl of Shaftes- 
bury, that famous Anthony Ashley Cooper whose 
initial "A" appears in the word "Cabal." They 
were originated in 1667, after the death of Claren- 
don, and were prepared in literary form by his 
private secretary, the immortal philosopher, John 
Locke, than whom no other philosopher ever did a 
worse piece of work in an attempt at constructive 
statesmanship. There is, however, no evidence that 
he really approved of the Constitutions, though he 
doubtless acquiesced in the political theory of his 
employer. ' 

Without any attempt to argue the question 
of authorship, it may be noted that th ese sen-

tences must convey a very distorted and con- 
fused idea to the reader's mind. As a matter 
of fact, Clarendon did not die until 1674, and 
Locke was Shaftesbury's private secretary, not 
Clarendon's. Doubtless the authors are famil- 
iar with these facts ; but if so, why not be more 
accurate? As remarkably misleading are the 
statements upon page 313, to the eflEect that 
Governor Nicholson's 'very unpopularity stirred 
his political enemy, James Blair, to go to Eng- 
land, and, by the greatest efforts to secure a 
charter for the second college in America, 
William and Mary, founded in 1693 at Wil- 
liamstown. From 1672 to 1698 Sir Edmund 
Andros was governor in Virginia, after his 
exciting experiences as governor of New 
England.' The date 1673 is wrong, Williams- 
town should be Williamsburg, and at this time 
Blair and Nicholson were friends. It would 
seem hard to use more careless language about 
this one topic; but this feat the authors accom- 
plish later (page 473) by referring to William 
and Mary College in Maryland! 

Not all the pages are so bad as these quoted : 
the treatment of the Eastern and Middle Col- 
onies is less inaccurate than that of the South- 
em Colonies. But the suspicion thus aroused 
finds too much justification elsewhere. A happy 
uncertainty or carelessness to the beginning of 
the year under the Old Style causes the writers 
to refer to the same event as of different years. 
On page 238, Charles II. dies in 1685, but 
on page 312 the news of James II.'s accession 
reaches Virginia in 1684; and the error is 
repeated on page 321. It would be better to 
take one system and stick to it. Further 
instances of confusion in dates may be noted: 
on page 132, 1558 should be 1658; on page 
237, 1626 should be 1624; on page 291 
(map), 1653 should be 1563. These are errors 
contained in the text. Appended to each sec- 
tion, and sometimes to an individual chap- 
ter, is a list of events with dates, entitled 
' Historical Perspective,' and sometimes this is 
supplemented by a colored scheme or plan to 
help the weary intellect. Both lists and plans 
are fearfully and wonderfully made, often 
inclu'ding matters not referred to in the text, 
and vice versa. The statements found in them 
are frequently inaccurate, and sometimes unin- 
telligible. The bibliographical matter also is 
not well selected, and one has a grave suspicion 
that some books included therein — e. g., the 
Johns Hopkins Studies — have not received 
exhaustive attention from the authors. The 
work, or at least this volume, in its present 
form, full of mistakes and omissions, can make 
little pretense to scholarship. To serve even a 
popular use, the succeeding volumes should 
show a marked improvement upon this one.

Fifty Yea rs of Illlnois.* 

It is perhaps one of the inevitable conse- 
quences of the centralization of power in the 
federal government of the United States, espe- 
cially since the Civil War, that not only should 
the various States lose individual prestige with 
their waning powers, but that the status of the 
American as an inhabitant or native of a State 
should seem to him of comparative unimpor- 
tance beside his status as a citizen of the United 
States. The practical decision by the arbitra- 
ment of arms in 1861-65 that the sovereign 
States of the Union do not possess that final 
attribute of sovereignty, the right of secession, 
— until that arbitrament a question open, at 
least, to discussion, — has diminished the impor- 
tance of the individual State in the minds of 
practically all Americans in the northern 
States, and has modified greatly the feeling of 
those in the South. It is likely that even now 
the real affection and pride of dwellers in the 
newer States, as in the West, turn toward the 
commonwealths of their origin in the East, 
rather than to those in which they live; while 
the descendants of immigrants of more recent 
introduction, and a fortiori the immigrants 
themselves, find their pride almost wholly 
absorbed by their American citizenship in rela- 
tion to the government at Washington, with 
little left for the closer and more intimate 
government in their own State capitol. 

No book published for a long while past can 
be said to compare with Colonel Clark E. Carp's 
' The mini : A Story of the Prairies,' as 
regards its effect of awakening in the breast of 
the inhabitant of an individual State, Illinois 
in this instance, a feeling of proper pride in 
the achievements of his' fellows as citizens of a 
State rather than of the Nation. No American 
can arise from a perusal of this book without a 
vastly increased respect, based upon authentic 
knowledge, for the people of Illinois ; and to 
the Ulinoisan it will come almost as a gospel 
of enlightenment and encouragement to inter- 
est himself in the past history and present 
fame of so majestic a commonwealth. This is 
the first and most important aspect of Colonel 
Carr's handsomely printed and entertaining 
volume: that it stands as the interpreter to 
.millions of people politically united of their 
own history and serious glory, and to the vaster 
multitude outside the State of the part played 
by Illinois in the enactment of one of the 
world's greatest political and social dramas. 
To the preparation of his book, the author has 
brought, first of all, actual experience in the 
field of which he treats, a mind informed and 
clarified by participation in mighty deeds, —

the wresting of thousands of square miles of the 
richest soil of the world from primeval wilder- 
ness to the highest pursuits of civilization, the 
building up within his own life-time of a popu- 
lation in numbers only to be estimated by~ 
millions and of a community which in intel- 
ligence and wealth is perhaps unsurpassed in. 
history. From this experience, and from per- 
sonal contact with the men who made Illinois 
great a half-century ago, he provides a series 
of pen-pictures of those whom Illinois gave to 
the Nation for its preservation during the 
period of its greatest struggle, Lincoln, Grant,. 
Douglas, Logan, Oglesby, Yates, Palmer, Inger- 
soll, Davis, Secretary Hay, — these are some 
of the names that fill a large place in Colonel 
Carr's pages. Nothing except the very high- 
est literary art could excel in vividness of pre- 
sentation the actuality of these figures, which 
live and breathe here as they did in life, men 
of like passions and feelings with ourselves,, 
humanized as they cannot be on the formal 
pages of history; strong men all, but with the 
weaknesses of the strong to keep them sweetly 
reasonable and humane. Chief figure of all is 
Lincoln, and Colonel Carr's portrait of ' Old 
Abe' must add to the iRterest, however great 
it is to-day, with which he is regarded. 

'My first impression was that lie was the home- 
liest man I had ever seen; but as he moved an^ 
spoke, this impression was gradually changed. He 
was awkward and ungainly, bony and angular, his- 
body abnormally extending, his long legs and arms 
terminating in big feet and large bony fingers. His 
neck was long, and seemed to be intended espe- 
cially to lift his head high enough to survey every 
object about him. His head was covered with thick 
matted brown hair; his forehead was not high but 
wide, his nose was prominent, his mouth large, his 
jaws widening back from his mouth and chin, and 
his cheek-bones high. He had dark grey eyes, well 
set in his head, heavy eyebrows, a large expressive 
mouth, and dark complexion.' 

The book may be briefly described as a story 
told in the first person by one who, at the 
beginning of the narrative, is a mere lad remov- 
ing with his parents from their comfortable 
home in central New York to a prairie farm in 
central Illinois, situated not a great way from 
the flourishing city of Galesburg. The father 
of this boy was already an abolitionist, and the 
son took his opinions and carried them through 
the days of persecution and unrighteousness to 
their great and bloody vindication on the fiel<3 
of battle. The fortunes of this little fellow are 
followed patiently through youth into man- 
hood, through the early struggles of Eepubli- 
can radicalism against Democratic conserva- 
tism, through the excitements of the Lincoln- 
Douglas debates and the nomination of Lincoln 
for the presidency, through Lincoln's election 
and inauguration, and through the fighting of 
Grant in the Mississippi valley, the narrative

closing with the -fall of New Orleans and the 
imminent control of the great river by the 
federal forces. So much of the story is fully 
authentic and in. a sense autobiographical. 

But, for good measure and mindful of his 
countrymen's liking for a love story, Colonel 
Carr has added a romance of real moment, an 
outgrowth of the times, properly subordinating 
it to the more important events of actual his- 
tory. This romance is in two parts, one having 
to do with the love of the youthful hero for a 
charming girl of wealth and station, the other 
with the career of a slave, the son of a slave, 
from the moment of his escape from a brutal 
overseer on a Missouri plantation to his trium- 
phant vindication as the descendant of an 
important and aristocratic family of France. 
Tliis story would make an entertaining book 
in itself, independent of the historical and 
biographical incidents in which it is imbedded. 
Taken as a whole, the book is of a sort not to 
he described in a phrase, — -a skilful blending 
of fact and fiction quite different from the usual 
historical romance in form and treatment. 

On his title-page Colonel Carr quotes from 
Father Hennepin the sentence from which the 
name of his work is derived : ^ The word Illinois 
comes from the Indian Illini, signifying a com- 
plete, finished, and perfect Man, imbued with 
the spirit and bravery of the men of every 
nation that ever lived.' The etymology cannot 
fail to gain new emphasis and significance 
through this intimate picture of men and 
measures in the most momentous period of 
Illinois history. Wallace Rice.

^ The Luxury of Children and Some Other Lux- 
uries ' (Harper) is a book of informal and very 
engaging essays by Mr. Edward Sandford Mar- 
tin, wherein is proved, to the satisfaction of all 
right-minded persons, that no other luxury is to 
be compared for a moment with the luxury of 
children. Incidentally the author makes his 
readers feel that life is a very good thing and 
that there is plenty of fun in it for the man who 
will cease striving so desperately to get things 
that he wouldn't care about if he had them. 
Besides their breezy optimism, the particular 
merit of the essays is that they are entertaining 
without being dogmatic on issues which are sel- 
dom discussed without the dullest kind of dog- 
matism. Most writers about children have an 
axe to grind. Mr. Martin does not; he tells us 
what he has observed and what he thinks, with- 
out insisting that we agi-ee with him, and with- 
out even being sure that his is the only right way 
of looking at the subject. He does not seem 
to cai-e much on what system of parental manage- 
ment children are brought up, or where, how 



much, or by what theories they are schooled. Yet 
he is not to be classed with those most unpleas- 
ant and insidious of all dogmatists, the advo- 
cates of the 'Just let them grow' method. The 
publishers have provided a delightful setting for 
this delightful book. There are eight full-page 
colored plates by Miss Sarah S. Stilwell, and the 
same artist has filled the wide margins with tiny 
pictures of quaint little lads and lassies, singly 
or in groups, working, playing, laughing, crying, 
sleeping, or wondering at the big world they live 
in. These little pictures are printed in two 
colors, with a decidedly original and pleasing 
result. 

Among the very choicest of the season's holi- 
day reprints are "three volumes which inaugurate 
the Dent-Dutton series of 'English Idylls.' The 
publishers state in one of the prefaces, that they 
hope eventually to include in the series ' all those 
pieces of fine literature which depend for their 
charm on the presentment of the simpler life and 
emotion amid the environment of sweet counti'y 
scenes around our old English homes.' They 
could not have selected three more charming 
idylls for a beginning than Goldsmith 's ' Vicar of 
Wakefield,' Mrs. Gaskell's 'Cranford,' and Miss 
Mitford's 'Our Village.' Each volume is very 
daintily bound in gray and gold, and delightfully 
illustrated by Mr. C. E. Brock. The quaint 
humor and picturesque setting which all three 
stories share in common, have tempted many 
illustrators; but the opportunity afforded by 
modern processes of color printing furnishes the 
present edition with ample excuse for being. 
Mr. Brock is at his best in pen-and-ink, but the 
soft coloring and delicate finish of his water- 
colors is almost as unusual, and his humor is of 
exactly the sort needed to interpret these clas- 
sics. He has provided twenty-five illustrations 
for each volume. In them all, the human figures 
are the central interest, but the village scenes, 
of the sort that are fast fading from English life, 
and the delightful costumes and manners of early 
Victorian days, all receive due attention. A brief 
foreword gives an interesting history of each 
classic. 'Cranford' and 'The Vicar' are of 
course published in their entirety; 'The Village' 
sketches are selected from the five volumes of the 
complete work, the effort being to choose those 
chapters that best show the author's personality 
and that are most directly studies of nature and 
of village character. These idylls are of the sort 
that never grow old or lose their interest; but 
one re-reads them with a new zest and a keener 
appreciation, to the . accompaniment of Mr. 
Brock's suggestive pictorial interpretations. 

A holiday publication in lighter vein, but 
charming enough to satisfy the most critical 
taste, is Mr. Oliver Herford's illustrated 'Ru- 
baiyat of a Persian Kitten' (Scribner). One 
opens it assured that it is. good, being Mr. Her- 
f ord 's, and closes it with the conviction that Mr. 
Herford has fairly out-done himself. The Kitten 
is a long-haired, frisky, introspective ball of furj 
the verses are a delicious combination of spark- 
ling humor and subtle parody. From the open- 
ing stanza, which advises the Kitten to

[Dee. 16, 



' Wake ! For the Golden Cat has put to flight 
The Mouse of Darkness with his Paw of Light : 
Which means, in Plain and simple every-day 
Unoriental Speech — The Dawn ia bright,' — 

through those that tell of the Kitten's disil- 
lusioning experiences with too active early birds, 
stolen dainties, savage dogs, and the mysteries of 
ink-bottles and looking-glasses, to the concluding 
quatrain, 

' And fear not lest Existence shut the Door 
On You and Me, to open it no more. 
The Cream of Life from out your Bowl shall pour 
Nine times — ere it lie broken on the floor," 

with the absurd little angel-pussy soaring away 
from a broken milk-bowl on the opposite page, 
every stanza and every picture.is irresistible. It 
is, almost useless to quote, since we cannot repro- 
duce the pictures, but we are tempted to give 
one or two of the stanzas. Here is the moth- 
eaten alley cat's advice to the Kitten: 

• Myself when young did eagerly frequent 
The Backyard fence and heard great argument. 
About it and about, yet ever more 
Came out with fewer fur than in I went.' 

And this is the Kitten's reflection on a tenanted 
mouse-trap : 

' Tis but a Tent where takes his one Night's Rest 
A Rodent to the Realms of Death address'd, 
When Cook, arising, looks for him and then — 
Baits, and prepares it for another Guest.' 

An art book at once beautiful and of peculiar 
interest and imiqueness is the collection of 
^Drawings of Hans Holbein,' the first volume in 
a series of * Drawings of the Great Masters' 
(imported by Scribner). It is tastefully bound 
in dull blue paper boards, stamped with a grace- 
ful design in gold, and backed with vellum. 
There are forty-eight quarto-sized plates, some 
in half-tone on white paper, others printed in 
tints and momited on a paper of harmonious 
shade; so that the publication is, to begin with, 
a luxurious and unusually alluring book of pic- 
tures. An introduction by Mr. A. L. Baldry, 
brief but pithy and suggestive, furnishes the 
''backing' that so many otherwise similar woi'ks 
lack, and adds greatly to the value of the port- 
folio, both for art students and casual purchasers. 
Most of the drawings here reproduced belong to 
the famous Windsor collection of eighty-seven 
portraits, whose checkered history Mr. Baldi'y 
traces down to the present time. Many of these, 
such as the portraits of the More family, of 
John Colet, Anne Boleyn, Sir Thomas Wyatt, 
Jane Seymour, Edward VI., and Philip Melanch- 
thon, are of decided histoi'ical interest, apart 
from their artistic value. Besides the Windsor 
drawings, there are a few from originals pre- 
served at Basle, among them being one study 
of sheep and several interesting German types. 
Mr. Baldry 's introduction sums up the essential 
facts of Holbein's life, with especial reference 
to his comprehensive artistic training and his 
many-sided artistic career, discusses very briefly 
his methods and aims in jx)rtraiture, and then 
turns to the specific subjects of the drawings. 
Attention is called to the master-touch that is as 
evident in Holbein's most fugitive work as in his 
most ambitious painting, to the 'exquisite combi- 



nation of delicacy and vigor' which is the charac- 
teristic mark of his drawings, and to 'the 
instructive variety in method' which they dis- 
play, and which a corresponding variation in 
the mounting and coloring of the plates aims to 
reproduce. Mr. Baldry 's comment not only fits 
his readers to appreciate the drawings, but is 
so inspiring that it will lead them to make the 
portfolio a point of departure for further study. 

Mrs. Julia Cartwright Ady, in her account of 
'The Life and Art of Sandro Botticelli' (But- 
ton), does not assume that her work is particu- 
larly original; she acknowledges indebtedness to 
many previous writers, particiSarly to Mr. Beren- 
son and Mr. Herbert Home, the chief recent 
authorities on the general subject, and to French 
and German commentators on the Sixtine fres- 
coes, the Dante drawings, and the relation be- 
tween Savonarola and the Botticelli brothers. 
She explains, too, that, in spite of the keen mod- 
em interest in Botticelli and the vast amount 
of study recently devoted to him, our knowledge 
of his history is still so scanty that no complete 
record can be given. The present work is an 
attempt to serve up the 'fragments,'— to put 
together in accessible and fairly popular form 
the results of research and of criticism from 
the time when Ruskin re-discovered Botticelli to 
the present, when Walter Pater, the Pre-Raph- 
aelite painters, and a host of others have made 
his name familiar and interesting to the art- 
loving public. Mrs. Ady's work is, of course, 
thoroughly standard and adequate, showing %^ 
full knowledge of the bibliography of the subject 
and an unusual ability to view her material in 
many different lights, and thus to make the most 
of it. The masters with whom the painter 
studied, the friends he loved, the environment 
that molded him, 'his relations with the Medicis 
and the Florentine humanists on the one hand, 
and his connection with Savonarola and the 
Piagnone revival on the other,' the life he lived 
and the pictures he painted, are all matters of 
interest to Mrs. Ady. Forty full-page plates 
and as many smaller pictures set in the text 
eke out the verbal descriptions of the paintings. 
A few portraits are reproduced, some of the 
mythical paintings, more of those dealing with 
sacred subjects, and seven of the curious draw- 
ings for the 'Divine Comedy.' A catalogue of 
Botticelli's principal works, with their present 
locations, is appended. We, of course, cannot 
do justice here to the special critical merits of 
the book, but merely call attention to it as a 
volume altogether calculated to appeal to the 
holiday buyer with a scholarly taste and a full 
purse. 

Students of English art will welcome the new 
popular edition of Sir Walter Armstrong's mono- 
graph on Gainsborough, recently imported by the 
Messrs. Scribner. The work was first published 
several years ago in a magnificent folio edition, 
the price of which put it far out of the reach of 
the general public, and which was besides very 
cumbersome to handle. The present edition, 
while designated as popular, is still a very hand- 
some book, of convenient size, substantially 



1904.]

bound, printed on excellent paper, and embel- 
lished with eight photogravures and forty fine 
half-tones. These illustrations foim a represen- 
tative collection of Gainsborough's portraits and 
landscapes, and furnish a clear and adequate 
impression of his work. For the benefit of those 
who are not familiar with the scope of the text, 
it may be said that it is a complete and scholarly 
biographical study, prefaced by a preliminary dis- 
cussion of the aesthetic principles involved in 
Gainsborough's methods, and by a chapter on 
'English Art and the Precursors of Gainsbor- 
ough,' which makes possible a comparative treat- 
ment later on. The biographer complains of the 
paucity of details for a life of Gainsborough, but 
he does not let his readers feel the deficiency. 
He fills out the skeleton of facts by an indus- 
trious following up of slight clues and a skilful 
use of whatever he can run down, producing a 
narrative at once vivacious and authoritative, 
interwoven with a singularly clear and illuminat- 
ing analysis of the painter's art. A complete 
catalogue of Gainsborough's pictures, including 
portraits, landscapes, and copies, is given in an 
appendix. 

Mr. N. Hudson Moore, known to connoisseurs 
in old china and old furniture for his delightful 
researches among these fascinating possessions 
of our ancestors, has now put readers who are 
interested in lace in his debt by writing 'The 
Lace Book.' The volume is published in elab- 
orate form by the Frederick A. Stokes Co., with 
a charming cover design, borders of coffee-col- 
ored lace around each page, and about seventy 
illustrations. Many of the pictures are photo- 
graphs showing rare specimens of lace; others 
are reproductions of famous portraits in which 
rare and beautiful lace is a prominent feature. 
Mr. Moore evidently believes that association 
with its wearers, and with the dress and man- 
ners of a period, makes up a large part of the 
interest attaching to the study of lace. His 
pages are full of quaint anecdotes, citations from 
old diaries, letters and account-books, iinven- 
tories of royal wardrobes, sumptuary laws and 
trade statutes, couplets from observant poets and 
comedians, all showing how important a part 
ruffs and ruffles, frills and flounces, caps, aprons, 
stomachers, cuffs and collars, lappets and mantil- 
las played in the life of by-gone days. Whether 
one knows or cares anything about the technical 
side of the subject, he cannot help being inter- 
ested in the fact that Prince Charles spent fifteen 
pounds for the gold and silver lace on two night- 
caps which he carried with him on his Spanish 
trip, or that King William the Silent once squan- 
dered one hundred and fifty-eight pounds for 
six point-lace cravats. The book is full of such 
little items, fully half of them about the men, 
who seem to have been quite as vain and extrava- 
gant as the Avomen, as long as fashion gave them 
the chance. For the more practical seeker after 
facts there is plenty of definite and explicit 
infoi-mation. The first chapter, on 'The Growth 
of Lace,' is necessarily very general, but the 
other four, which treat respectively of Italian, 
Flemish, French and Spanish, English and Irish 



laces, are much less discursive, and about one- 
third of each chapter is devoted to a reference 
list which contains brief descriptions of all the 
principal kinds of lace included in the chapter 
title. 'The Lace Book' must be counted one of 
the most successful of the holiday publications. 

Another book on the same subject, but quite 
different in scope, method of treatment, and 
mechanical features, is Mr. Samuel L. Golden- 
berg's manual called 'Lace: Its Origin and His- 
tory' (Brentano's). Mr. Goldenberg makes no 
attempt to brush the dust from the early history 
of lace-making for the delectation of the col- 
lector or the dilettante. His aim is to furnish 
those whose relation to lace is primarily com- 
mercial with a simple but comprehensive treatise 
that will fit them to judge of lace, and serve as 
a practical guide in times of doubt. However, 
in spite of his very matter-of-fact attitude, he 
has found it impossible entirely to dissociate lace 
from its makers and wearers, or to get rid of 
all the romance that inevitably colors the sub- 
ject. Mr. Goldenberg 's book is practical with- 
out being dull; his information is summary and 
straight to the point; his tables of 'Characteris- 
tics of the Different Types of Lace,' which occu- 
py two-thirds of the book, are complete, well- 
arranged, and explicit. This publication is of 
course not so sumptuous as 'The Lace Book,' 
but it is neat and attractive, and there are an 
abundance of well-printed plates. 

Probably no other city in the world presents 
so kaleidoscopic a combination of pulsing modem 
life, historical associations, and mediaeval 
romance as Vienna. In his book entitled 'Imperial 
Vienna' (John Lane), Mr, A. S. Levetus attempts 
to give his readers at least a glimpse of each of 
the city's manifold interests and activities. One 
notable thing about the book is the fact that it 
is comprehensive without being barren,— an 
unusual combination, as readers of guide-books 
can attest. Another striking feature is its wealth 
of illustration, furnished by Herr Erwin Puch- 
inger, whose interesting sketches of the architec- 
ture of the oity and some of its street types 
form a delightful record of impressions, besides 
being a vivid commentary on the text. They are 
from sketches in charcoal, pencil, j>en-and-ink, 
and wash, so that there is plenty of variety in 
method of treatment as well as in subject-mattei'. 
Mr. Levetus acknowledges special indebtedness 
to the Austrian Emperor, who gave author and 
illustrator permission to visit the Hofburg and 
other palaces for the purj>ose of making observa- 
tions and drawings. This fact adds a special 
interest to the chapters about Austrian court life 
and ceremony. A number of chapters are devoted 
to old Vienna, several to picturesque historical 
incidents such as the visit of Napoleon, others 
treat of the magnificent galleries that house the 
national collections of painting and sculpture, 
of the musical and dramatic interests of the city, 
its universities, its society, and the life of its 
people. The cover design is very handsome, and 
the tinted paper attractive. 

Three toast books offer a wide field of choice 
to the seeker for after-dinner wit and wisdom.

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



A very substaaitial and systematic collection is 
* Toasts and Tributes,' edited by Mr. Arthur 
Gray, and published by Messrs. Rohde & Has- 
kins. As its name suggests, it contains not only 
formal toasts, but also quotable sentiments. 
There is a short essay on the origin of toasts by 
the editor; another about the responsibilities of 
the toast-master by Mr. Allan Forman, and some 
epigrammatic post-prandial philosophy contrib- 
uted by Creswell Maclaughlin. These writers 
and others furnish a few original toasts, but the 
main strength of the volume lies in its large 
collection of standard quotations, conveniently 
arranged under twenty-five different headings 
and carefully indexed by subjects and authors. 
A few blank pages are left at the end of the 
book for the entry of original toasts or those 
heard at dinners. The volume is printed with 
rubricated title-page and running-heads and 
ornamental chapter-headings, and is bound in gay 
colors.— In lighter vein, wittier, and more strictly 
a toast-book, but, on the other hand, less com- 
plete and substantial, is the volume entitled 
'Prosit.' It is issued by Messrs. Paul Elder & 
Co., under the auspices of the Spinner's Club of 
San Francisco, who think that the state of the 
vine is the fitting place whence a toast-book 
should emanate. The California writers have 
contributed a number of original toasts and col- 
lected others, ancient and modem, including a 
few in foreign languages. Among the best of the 
newer ones is Mr. Jack London's 'A health to 
the man on trail this night; may his grub hold 
out; may his dogs keep their legs; may his 
matches never miss fire.' The canvas cover 
shows an ingenious design by Mr. Gordon Ross, 
who also furnishes a very bibulous frontispiece. 
—The third book, 'Waes Hael,' written and 
compiled by Miss Edithe Lea Chase and Capt. 
W. E. P. French, and published by the Grafton 
Press, seems rather more representative than 
'Prosit,' and equally clever and up-to-date. 
Among its novel features are the tiny beer stein 
attached to the ribbon marker, the 'apology' in 
the form of a very clever parody of Kipling, and 
the grouping of the toasts according to the man- 
ner in which they should most appropriately 
be drunk. For example, toasts to Humanity, 
America, the Union, and the Flag are to be 
quaffed 'In Bumpers'; the army and navy are 
to be toasted 'In Red Wine'; sweethearts, wives 
and mothers, love and marriage need 'The Lov- 
ing Cup'; wine and revelry are to be drunk 
'From the Flowing Bowl'; the professions and 
such abstractions as music, literature, science, and 
wit, go down 'In Mixed Ale'; while toasts to 'The 
Day After,' 'The Men Who Lost,' death and 
parting, use up 'The Lees of the Wine Cup.' 
There are some fourteen hundred toasts in the 
book, about one-third of which are new and origi- 
nal. The long list of toasts to colleges and to 
states of the Union will prove acceptable to 
harassed toast-masters. The book is carefvdly 
indexed and attractively printed and bound. 

This year's additions to Messrs. Henry T. 
Coates & Co.'s 'Photogravure Series' of books 
of travel are 'France: Historic and Romantic,' 



in two volumes, and 'Switzerland: Pietui-esque 
and Descriptive' in one volume, both being the 
work of Mr. Joel Cook. They belong to the 
systematic, orderly, and objective class of trav- 
elers' guides, and embody more detail than is 
essential to any except those persons who con- 
template a journey through the countries 
described. For this latter class, Mr. Cook's 
volumes would prove excellent preparatory read- 
ing, and would serve equally well as guide-books, 
—though they are rather too heavy to can-y 
about comfortably. Copious indices and descrip- 
tive running-heads make the contents available 
for hasty reference. The book about France 
opens with a chapter on the English Channel, 
wherein all the ports and places of interest on 
both shores are noted and described. Next comes 
the journey to Paris by several different routes, 
then a full description of the capital city and its 
environs. The remainder of the work describes 
vai-ious journeys from Paris; south to Provence 
and the Rhone valley, and to the Mediterranean 
and the Riviera, west into Britanny, southwest 
to the Bay of Biscay and the Pyrenees, and 
northeast into Flanders and Belgium, the last- 
named country being included because of its 
similarity to France in geography, language, and 
history. It seems as if Mr. Cook had neglected 
nothing in the way of either historic or romantic 
associations which could enrich his work. About 
fifty photogravure illustrations display the art, 
architecture, and landscape of the country. The 
volume on Switzerland includes the Rhine trip, 
which is generally combined by American visi- 
tors with the regular Swiss tour. The method 
of treatment is the same as in the other volumes, 
except that while legend and history get equal 
attention, scenic description naturally gets more, 
both in text and pictures. Western Switzerland, 
eastern 'Switzerland, the Upper Rhine, the Mid- 
dle Rhine and Main, the great Rhine Gorge, and 
the Lower Rhine are the six divisions of the 
tour. The volumes are handsomely bound, and 
each work is protected by cloth slip covers and 
a substantial cloth case. 

Mr, Clifton Johnson and his camera have in 
past years journeyed together through France, 
Scotland, Ireland, England, and New England, 
This year they have chosen to stay in America 
again, and have spent their time exploring some 
'Highways and Byways of the South.' ^ The 
records of the expedition have been made into a 
handsome volume, plentifully illustrated from the 
author's photographs, and very prettily bound, 
bearing the imprint of the Macmillan Co. As 
usual, Mr. Johnson has avoided the bustle of 
towns and cities; he gives no facts about the 
commercial progress of the New South, and takes 
no side on the race question. Instead he rambles 
through the woods and fields, stops for the night 
at isolated hamlets or lonely farmhouses, and 
describes the scenes along the way and the peo- 
ple he meets in his journeyings. Chapters like 
'The Birthplace of Lincoln,' 'John Brown's 
Town,' or 'Way Down upon the Suwanee River' 
have an incidental historic or romantic interest, 
and so have many of the pictures; but the main 



1904.] 



THE DIAI. 



429 



purpose of the book is to describe the unspoiled 
iTiral life of a picturesque part of America— the 
most picturesque part, Mr. Johnson calls it, and 
he ought to be a good judge. His studies of types 
like the Georgia 'Cracker' and the Tennessee 
mountaineer are sympathetic and full of humor. 

Miss Esther Singleton is never at a loss for 
a subject on which to compile a volume of 
•extracts by well-known authors. This year she 
lias chosen to deal with 'Famous Women,' limit- 
ing the very elastic adjective by making it refer 
to women who have wielded an appreciable 
political influence. The list of such women of 
•course includes many sovereigns, queens of the 
left hand, mistresses of salons whose interest in 
politics was intellectual, women like the Duchesses 
•de Longueville and du Maine who plunged into 
■civil strife for the love of intrigue, and a few 
like Agnes Sorel and Joan of Arc whose sense 
■of duty led them into the political arena. Of 
the forty women included by far the greater num- 
ber are French, and all but a very few of the 
rast are English. The selections, which deal 
•chiefly with the political career of each subject, 
are chosen with a view to variety and pictur- 
€squeness as well as accuracy, and like all Miss 
Singleton's compilations 'Famous Women as 
Described by Great Writers' is interesting read- 
ing. A portrait of each famous woman stands 
before the sketch of her career. The binding is 
uniform with the rest of Miss Singleton's works. 
(Dodd, Mead & Co.) 

Another book about famous French women is 
'Miss Geraldine Broolcs's 'Dames and Daughters 
of the French Court' (Crowell). But instead of 
treating her celebrities as founders of salons or 
as political and social leaders. Miss Brooks writes 
of their intimate family life, showing them liter- 
ally as 'dames and daughters' in their own homes. 
With this point in view, she has chosen from the 
innumerable characters at her disposal ten of 
the most natural and lovable— those that will 
«tand close scrutiny and repay close acquaintance. 
All of them have been written about many times 
before, some by so discriminating an analyst of 
human nature as Sainte-Beuve ; but Miss Brooks 's 
original and very American point of view and 
her fresh and racy style throw a new light upon 
her subjects. Portraits reproduced from famous 
paintings and a cheerful cover give a holiday 
air to the book. 

Pai-ody, particularly clever parody, is so rare 
nowadays that one opens Miss Myrtle Reed's 
"'Book of Clever Beasts' (Putnam), further 
described on the title page as ' Studies in Unnatu- 
ral History,' with a lively expectation of joys to 
come, which fortunately is not doomed to dis- 
appointment. The tales purport to be written 
by Mr. Johnson-Sitdown, a telegraph operator, 
who is compelled by ill health to return to 
' Nature, and resolves to make the most of his 
enforced vacation in approved modern fashion 
Tjy writing up his experiences. Little Upsidaisi, 
a field-mouse, Kitchi-Kitchi, a red squirrel. 
Jagg the Skootaway goat, Snoof, the big bear 
that lives off the garbage heap at the Geyser 
Hot^l, Jenny Ragtail and Jim Crow, will at once 



suggest their originals to anybody who keeps up 
with the products of the Long-Seton-Roberts 
school. Little Upsidaisi communicates with Mr. 
Johnson-Sitdown by means of the Morse code, 
which unfortunately is also intelligible to Tom- 
Tom, the pet cat of the hermitage ; Jim Crow sets 
his own broken leg in a clay cast; and the other 
'clever beasts' perform feats equally marvellous. 
Miss Reed is a daring pimster, as well as an 
ingenious fabulist. Not content merely to enter- 
tain her readers with animal stories, she keeps 
up a running comment— or, rather, makes Mr. 
Johnson-Sitdown do so— upon the exigencies of 
the literary life and upon modem literary and 
scientific (or pseudo-scientific) methods. Mr. 
Peter Newell 's nine pictures of the clever beasts 
add the finishing touch of drollery to the book. 

'Yosemite Legends' (Paul Elder & Co.) is one 
of the most original and artistic of the smaller 
holiday publications. The text consists of six 
short legends, eaeh relating the substance of some 
ancient folk-song of the Ah-wah-nee-chee Indians, 
who dwelt in the Yosemite valley until the tribes 
of the pale-face drove them out. One of the 
legends tells how the Yosemite Fall got its name; 
another explains why the Indians fear the Bridal 
Veil; a third reveals the origin of the pointed 
rock that sticks up in the cliff between the fall 
and the canon of the Arrow-wood. There is a 
weird legend of Mirror Lake, and a bit of history 
about the three sons of the last great chief of 
the Ah-wah-nee-chee, who were captured at the 
Oase of the triple peak called thereafter 'The 
Three Brothers.' The stories are admirably 
related by Miss Bertha H. Smith, who succeeds 
in transcribing the impressiveness, the sense of 
mystery, and the barbaric poetry of the originals 
into her carefully finished and dramatic little 
sketches. Miss Florence Lundborg, the illus- 
trator, has furnished a dozen full-page wash- 
drawings of a mystical, impressionistic sort, 
showing the valley as it might appear to the 
awed and frightened tribesman who has fallen 
under the spell of the legends. These drawings 
are reproduced in color, as are the marginal 
decorations, whose curious patterns suggest the 
designs of Indian pottery and baskets. 

'Kitty of the Roses' is the sentimental little 
romance of a young architect who found the lady 
of his dreams in a rose-garden, had to leave her 
before he had more than found her, just failed 
to see her again before she sailed for Algiers, 
and at last caught her once for all in the rose- 
garden. Roses, pink, white, and red, riot through 
the story, which is simply and prettily told. Mr. 
Ralph Henry Barbour is the author, Mr. Frederic 
J. von Rapp the illustrator, and the J. B. Lippin- 
cott Co. the publishers. The pink cloth cover is 
stamped in gold, with a gold border framing a 
vignette of Kitty,— a form of cover decoration 
that seems to be very popular this season. The 
illustrations are tinted, and the page margins are 
filled with long-stemmed roses.

red and black, as in previous issues; but this 
year the twisted proverbs and the illustrations 
accompanying them are all new. Possibly this 
second crop of cynicism is not quite so fresh and 
sparkling as the first, but it is still sprightly 
enough to be very entertaining to cynics and 
others. There is really no reason for fault-find- 
ing when we get a number of new proverbs as 
good as these: 'Actresses will happen in the best 
regulated families,' and 'You will never miss 
water while the Champagne runs dry.' Mr, 
Oliver Herford's preface, 'To the World at 
Large,' is one of the best things in the book, 
and his picture called 'The First Monday' is 
another irresistible bit of fooling. Mr. Herford 
and his collaborators. Miss Ethel Watts Mum- 
ford and Mr. Addison Mizner, are putting all 
cynics in their debt by showing up the profession 
in so genial and pleasing a light. 

' Gilhooleyisms ' is a little book of observations 
about life, made by 'Lord Gilhooley' (otherwise 
Mr. Frederick H. Seymour) and illustrated by 
Mr. Tom Fleming, The epigrams vaiy greatly 
in merit, their worst faults being that they 
generally take themselves too seriously and oc- 
casionally incline to triteness. 'There are people 
who make themselves so ridiculous, living, that 
they are not forgfotten when dead,' just misses 
being very good; so does 'The genius does one 
thing too well, and other things not well enough, ' 
These are fair samples of the book's quality. 
We should like the observations better without 
the pictures, which emphasize the luipleasant 
cynicism of the text without adding to it either 
humor or point. (Stokes.) 

Of the same general sort, but cleverer and 
much better illustrated, is a little book of 'Com- 
pleted Proverbs' (Coates), by Mr. L. de V, 
Matthewman, ' "True love is grounded on es- 
teem," but esteem rests upon no foundation,' 
* "Man proposes" when woman so pennits,' 
' "Live within yoiu' means," if you have any 
means of doing so,' — these excerpts will give an 
idea of the satirical-humorous treatment of the 
proverbs. They are genuinely illustrated and 
greatly improved by the pictures, which are 
witty and suggestive. These are the work of 
Mr. Clare Victor Dwiggins, who has collaborated 
with Mr. Matthewman in previous volumes. 

'Flower Fables and Fancies' (Stokes), by 
Mr. N. Hudson Moore, is a sort of modernized, 
expanded, and de-sentimentalized version of the 
chapter on the language of flowers that always 
found a place in the 'Friendship's Offerings' of 
our grandmothers. It contains a vast amount 
of pleasantly diversified information about flow- 
ers, references to them in English poetry and 
Greek or oriental myth, explanations of the odd 
conceits involved in local nomenclature, quaint 
superstitions about flowers, their religious sym- 
bolism, their medicinal uses, the lore of perfumes, 
the rites of May-day and other floral festivals, 
glimpses of old-time gardens, and occasionally a 
curious bit of botanical information, or the his- 
tory of a floral mania like the tulip fad in Hol- 
land. The book is prettily gotten up, with tinted 



floral borders in various colors, a number of 
illustrations from photographs, and a dainty 
cover. 

Mr. John Uri Lloyd's latest story, 'Scroggins,' 
is published by Messrs, Dodd, Mead & Co, in a 
handsome holiday edition, illustrated and deco- 
rated by Mr. Reginald B. Birch. Scroggins is a 
Rocky Mountain stage-driver, who, finding him- 
self suddenly a millionaire, first tries to spend 
his money and then goes back to his old home 
and gives it away, finally returning happily to 
the box-seat of the Gulch stage. The plot is- 
perfectly conventional, but there is a good deal 
of pathos in the telling, and much sound sense 
in the old stage-driver's philosophy of life. The 
cover, which simulates birch bark, with a pan- 
elled view of the Rockies set in across the top,, 
is unique and effective. 

Of all the so-called pocket editions, the 'Vest 
Pocket Series' (Putnam) is probably the small- 
est, being literally tiny enough to slip conveni- 
ently into the receptacle indicated by its name. 
The text is printed lengthwise on the page, thus 
making it possible to use fairly large type with- 
out the necessity of breaking the lines of vei"se. 
Goldsmith's 'Deserted Village,' Browning's 
'Pied Piper' and 'The Last Ride' (in one vol- 
ume), Tennyson's 'Locksley Hall,' and Bums's 
'Tam O'Shanter' and 'The Cotter's Saturday 
Night' (the last two furnished with glossaries), 
are some of the titles from which the man who 
wants a pocket companion— and the woman, too, 
if she can lay claim to a pocket— may make a 
choice. The little books open easily, and are 
bound in flexible morocco of vaiious colors. 

There is no end to editions of the Rubaiyat. 
A new one, which will interest the Omar cult 
because of its pictures, is offered by Messrs. E. 
P. Dutton & Co. It contains Edward FitzGer- 
ald 's original preface and is illustrated by twelve 
photogi'avures after the drawing of Mr. Gilbert 
James. Omarians who care for the Vedder 
illustrations will find Mr. James's inteipretations 
monotonous, lacking both in imagination and dra- 
matic quality. They all picture the poet and the 
lady to whom he sings, thus limiting their scope 
to the poet's action and feeling instead of to 
the action and feeling of the poem. As the 
poster style precludes characterization, there is 
little left for the artist to strive for except 
graceful composition and a Persian setting. 
These he certainly secures, and his designs, 
though they miss the subtler suggestions of the 
poem, are exceedingly decorative. 

A new volume in Mr. John Lane's 'Flowers of 
Parnassus' series of bibelots is William Morris's 
'Defence of Guenevere,' with six illusti'ations 
by Miss Jessie M. King. Last winter Mr. Lane 
published this poem, with a number of Moriis's 
shorter pieces, in a regulation-sized volume, 
which Miss King illustrated; and the pictures 
in the present edition appear to be reduced from 
those in the larger one. In this miniature size 
they ai'e very dainty, and the little book will 
make the best sort of Christmas greeting for a 
friend Avho cares for Morris's poetry.

'The Wandering Host' is a forceful little alle- 
gory by Dr. David Starr Jordan, published in 
holiday form, with decorative borders and a 
pretty cover, by the American Unitariaji Asso- 
ciation. The text was first printed several years 
ago under the title of 'The Story of the Innum- 
erable Company,' by which name some readers 
may remember it. The present edition is revised 
and slightly enlarged. We do not see any reason' 
why President Jordan's singularly' direct and 
vigorous style should mask itself in symbolism, 
and we like him better in ''The Call of the Twen- 
tieth Century' than in this, allegorical argument 
for individualism in the moral and religious life. 
Nevertheless, his points are w'ell taken, and i his 
logic sound and convincing beneath the figurative 
dress. 

In the 'Art Gift-book Series,' of the Fleming 
H. Revell Co., with its pretty and unusual bind- 
ing and tinted marginal decorations, come two 
little books, 'Divided, the Story of a Poem,' by 
Miss Clara Laughlin, and 'Gwen, an Idyll of the 
Canyon,' by Ralph Connor. 'Divided,' which has 
already appeared in one of the magazines, is the 
story of a lonely and sentimental' little girl, who 
happened upon an illustrated copy bf Jean Inge- 
low 's poero. of 'Divided,' liked its pictures, pored 
over its symbolism, and finally grasped its mean- 
ing by living through the same sad experience 
herself. Like all Miss Laughlin 's work, this 
story is a piece of special pleading,— a reminder 
that fame and a career, however splendid, are 
not worth the loss of love. It is simply and 
graphically written, and is well suited to its 
present tasteful setting. 'Gwen,' dedicated 'to 
all who question the Why of human pain,' is an 
episode taken from Ralph Connor's popular 
novel, 'The Sky Pilot.' Standing by itself, it 
makes a vivid and convincing study of the Pilot's 
wonderful power, and is just the gift with vsrhich 
to brighten the Christmas of a sad or sick fri£ndw 
The marginal drawings are clever and stxg- 
gestive. 

An illustrated holiday edition of Mr, Hamil- 
ton Wright Mabie's 'Parables of Life' is pub- 
lished by the Macmillan Co., with four new alle- 
gories added and eight drawings by Mr. W. 
Benda reproduced in photogravure. We like 
these parables as well as anything that Mr. 
Mabie has written lately. The imagery is grace^ 
ful' and sufficiently transparent, without being 
conventional, the movement rapid, and the 
thoughts vital, incisive, and inspiring. Mr. Ben- 
da's drawings are quite in the spirit of the text, 
as well as being artistic in themselves and well 
reproduced. 

Among the calendars for the new year those 
issued by Mr. Alfred Bartlett are as usual dis- 
tinguished for their artistic designs and well 
selected quotations. The most novel among them 
is the small '^Sepia Calendar,' decorated with six 
landscapes from drawings by Miss Helen Sin- 
clair Patterson, These are printed on the calen- 
dar sheets directly from photographic negatives,, 
and a touch of color is added by hand, making 
an original and pleasing effect. One of the least 
pretentious of Mr. Bartlett 's publications is 'A 
Calendar of Inspiration,' gotten up in his char- 



acteristic style with decorative borders and 
initials, and old English lettering, ahd printed 
in black and red. There are two' sheets to the 
month, each containing a . (Quotation from Such 
masters of hope and ^ood cheer as Stevenson^ 
Dr. van Dyke, Phillips Brooks, Enierson, and 
David Swing; Similar in spirit and make-up, 
but larger and more elaborately colored, and 
decorated, is 'The House of Life' calendar. The 
quotations are of the same inspiring type, but 
less familiar. Six of the twelve sheets are 
printed in sepia and purple, the rest in sepia and 
ochre. The 'Calendar of Prayers by Robert 
Louis Stevenson' is not new, but the 1905 edition 
appears in four colors, every other page being 
done in green and gold. To say that the decora- 
tive setting; which suggests the pages of an 
illuminated missal, is beautiful enciugh for the 
prayers is high praise, but no more than is 
deserved. 'The St. Cecilia Calendar' is a single 
sheet, with a picture of the saint and a border 
around picture and calendar, for decoration. — 
*A Book of Days' is the title of a calendar issued 
by the Young People's Religious Union, a Uni- 
tarian society. Each page contains the calendar 
for a week, with seven quotations taken from the 
tporks of some prominent Unitarian. There is no 
lack of good material for such a calendar, and 
in the present instance excellent use has been 
made ot jt. The calendar is tied up with green 
coyd, is printed in green, and is bound in a green 
and gold cover.— Decidedly imique and as pretty 
as we always expect Japanese work to be, is a 
series of Japanese ealenda.rs published in Tokj'O 
by T. Hasegawa, Two of the most elaborate are 
in the form of an oblong case or pocket prettily, 
decorated. Into this slips a packet of twelve 
sheets, which can be sorted to get the current 
nipnth uppermost. Each sheet shows a Japanese 
print, the designs in the smaller of the two calen- 
dars being mostly landscapes and flowers, and 
in the larger consisting of street scenes and 
characteristic bits of Japanese life. The- 'Pagoda 
C^ilendar' is made up of twelve crosswise' sec- 
tidnp, which spread out td form a fascinating^ 
many-storied pagoda, wi^h quaint little figures 
perched on its various balconies. Three booklet 
calendars show respectively the flowers of the 
Japanese year, the landscapes of Tokyo, and 'the 
months of Japanese children.' The pictures in 
the last-named booklet suggest that life is one 
long and amusing holiday for Japanese boys and 
girls. Most unique of all is the ' Calendar in 
Japanese Towels. ' An introduction es^plains tl^is^t 
according to Japanese standards every household 
utensil mast be decorative as well as iiseful, and 
that the patterns on, towels are almost as varied^ 
beautiful, and full of symbolism as the patterns 
On china or screens. Having looked through the 
calendar, each page of which has for its baek-i 
ground a towel pattern. We are ready to credit 
this statement.— Very gaudy in comparison •Vvith 
the dainty Japanese calendars just mentioned 
are three published by Messrs. E. P. Dutton & 
Co. 'The Coon Calendar' is conceived along, the 
lines of broad caricature, the twelve large And

types. 'Gems from the Poets' is a floral calen- 
dar, or rather a series of flower pictxires, each 
accompanied by a 'gem' on the general floral 
theme. The calendai* proper is a mere accessory, 
and is contained in a small appendage fastened 
by ribbons to the large sheets. The 'Friendship 
Calendar ' contains twelve quotations from a wide 
range of authors. The borders and initials are 
in colors, and are fairly artistic in design. 



Books for the Young. 
n. 



Judging from the few books remaining for con- 
sideration in this second of our two articles 
devoted to the children's books of the present 
season, it would seem that the output this year 
has been at once more forward and less prolific 
than for several seasons past. But the residue 
with which we have now to deal contains a number 
of books of more than ordinary merit. Especially 
praiseworthy are several new editions or new 
adaptations of books that have gladdened the hearts 
of past generations, and these will have our first 
attention. 

. It is doubtful if many children will 
n^ covert ^® ^^^® **^ appreciate fully the charm 

of the setting in which is offered to 
them the series of 'Stories from Shakespeare's 
Plays' (Dent-Dutton.) These dainty volumes have 
all the outward characteristics of the well-known 
'Temple Shakespeare,' being issued in the same 
convenient form, with the same beauty of typog- 
raphy and binding, and possessing the added 
attraction of graceful illustrations. The stories 
are retold, simply and sensibly, by Mrs. Alice 
Spencer Hoffman, with the aid of plentiful 
extracts from the plays themselves. Two vol- 
umes have so far appeared: 'The Tempest,' 
illustrated by Mr. Walter Crane, and 'King Eichard 
II., ' with drawings by Miss Dora Curtis. — Of special 
distinction also is the handsome new edition of 
Mrs. Anna Jameson's 'Shakespeare's Heroines' 
(Dutton). The text requires no comment at this 
time; it need only be said that Mr. W. Paget has 
illustrated the book most sumptuously, his six full- 
page pictures in color and seventy drawings in half- 
tone leaving little to be desired. — Prof. U. Waldo 
Cutler has utilized the wealth of splendid material 
in Sir Thomas Malory's 'Morte d 'Arthur' for his 
volume of ' Stories of King Arthur and his Knights ' 
(Crowell). Simplification of both the narrative and 
the language in which it is told have been con- 
stantly in the editor's mind, and the result is a 
book unusually attractive to children. — A somewhat 
similar service has been performed for another 
old favorite in the ' Stories of Robin Hood and his 
Merry Outlaws' (Crowell), by Mr. J. Walker 
McSpadden. The old ballads are the sources from 
which the several tales have been derived, and 
stanzas from them preface every chapter. This 
book and the one just mentioned are issued in 
uniform style in the series of 'Children's Favor- 
ite Classics,' with colored frontispieces and other 
illustrations. 

There is not much poetry, as distin- 
aTd^old^^^ guished from mere jingle, among the 

children's books this year, but the 
little that there is deserves prominent mention. 
Mrs. Mary Mapes Dodge has prepared a new and 
enlarged edition of her 'Rhymes and Jingles' 



(Scribner), known to younger readers for thirty 
years past. The pieces newly included show no 
trace of their author's more than three score years, 
but are as fresh and youthful as their predecessors 
of a long generation ago. The book has been 
beautifully illustrated and decorated by Miss Sarah 
S. Stilwell, in a style uniform with Mr. Charles 
Robinson's pictorial setting of 'A Child's Garden 
of Verses. ' — Miss Stilwell has also designed the 
pictures for Miss Katharine Pyle's 'Childhood' 
(Dutton), using a combination of delicate reds and 
blacks, and achieving marked success. The verses 
are tender and graceful, and of more merit than 
usually goes to the entertainment of American 
children. — The poems of the late Blanche Mary 
Channing have been posthumously collected, and 
are published in a pretty little book called ' Lullaby 
Castle and Other Poems' (Little, Brown & Co.). 
More than half of the poems in the collection are 
intended for children, and they possess a delicacy 
of feeling which deserves to make them widely 
known. — An excellent book in everything but name 
is the quarto volume entitled 'Babies' Classics' 
(Longmans, Green & Co.), in which are brought 
together some two score poems for children by 
standard authors. The compiler. Miss Lilia Scott 
MacDonald, has made a most intelligent selection, 
including a number of old-time favorites by such 
forgotten writers as Jane and Ann Taylor and 
Mary Howitt. The illustrations by Mr. Arthur 
Hughes are nothing less than a rare artistic treat. 
Among books having to do with 
8cho"lUfe school and college life, the collection 

00 ije. ^^ short stories brought together by 

Mr. Arthur Stanwood Pier under the collective 
title of ' Boys of St. Timothy 's ' (Scribner) deserves 
high praise. The school concerned is that of St. 
Mark's of Southborough, Mass., and the deeds of 
its youth are set forth in a series of entertaining 
episodes. Most of these, but not all, are concerned 
with athletic sports and the playing fields, and all 
are instinct with the spirit of honorable competi- 
tion. The book is cleverly illustrated by various 
hands. — A service somewhat similar to that of Mr. 
Pier's for St. Mark's has been done for Phillips 
Exeter Academy by Mr. Albertus T, Dudley in his 
story called 'Making the Nine' (Lee & Shepard). 
The interest of the book, as the title indicates, is 
with baseball. It shows the spiritual side of a 
game which Americans hold in too little esteem, 
describing how a lad both young and slight wins 
his way to a place on the school nine by the 
patient development of every manly quality, — If 
Mr, Leslie W. Quirk had not been quite so eager 
to make his hero heroic, his story called 'Baby 
Elton, Quarter-Back' (Century Co.) would take 
equal rank with the two just mentioned. It deals 
with a boy's freshman year in college, and gives 
him an amount of glory that is almost overwhelm- 
ing. It is a well-told story, nevertheless, with 
plenty of exciting incidents. — ' Helen Grant 's 
Friends' (Lee & Shepard) has to do with a young 
person whom Miss Amanda M. Douglas has already 
made familiar to us in a previous book called 
'Helen Grant's Schooldays.' The new story 
describes how the heroine won her way through a 
secondary school with the help (and occasional 
hindrance) of her numerous friends. — Miss Amy 
Brooks also brings a familiar figure to the front 
once more in 'Dorothy Dainty at School' (Lee & 
Shepard). Dorothy's mild adventures at Aunt 
Charlotte's educational institution are eclipsed in 
interest by the much more thrilling experiences of 
little Nancy Ferris, who is kidnapped and made 
to dance upon the stage.

stories of 
home life. 



A little brother and sister living with 
their deserted and unhappy mother 
come down very late Christmas Eve 
and surprise a real Santa Claus; who turns out to 
be their father, returned from long wanderings 
restored to moral sanity and in possession of great 
wealth. This is the situation described in Dr. S. 
Weir Mitchell's tale called 'Mr. Kris Kringle, ' now 
published in a new edition by Messrs. George W. 
Jacobs & Go. The pictures, by Mr. Clyde O. 
DeLand, are thoroughly harmonious with the atmos- 
phere of the charming little story. — A book with 
the genuine holiday flavor is Mrs. Olive Thorne 
Miller's ' Kristy's Queer Christmas ' (Houghton, 
Mifflin & Co.). Little Kristy gathers a number of 
interesting grown folk about a great hearth fir'^ 
on Christmas evening in order to have them describe 
the most wonderful thing that ever happened to 
each of them on that wonderful day. The result 
is a series of tales which cover pretty much all of 
America in scene, and which are in turn heroic, 
thrilling, and humorous. — The scene of ' Dandelion 
Cottage' (Holt) is laid by its author. Miss Carroll 
Watson Kankin, in northern Michigan, where a 
number of girls and an occasional boy work out 
their destiny in what had been the rectory of the 
small town. The story is one of difficulties bravely 
overcome, and the humor of the tale is well borne 
out in the pictures by Florence Scovel Shinn and 
Elizabeth E. Finley. — To escape treatment more 
rigid than kind the heroine of Miss Harriet A. 
Cheever's 'Lou' (Estes) runs away from the insti- 
tution in which she had been placed as an orphan, 
and finds happiness at the end of her long journey. 

— How a small middle-class London lad wins his 
way to the esteem of his elder brothers is told most 
attractively by Mr. B. A. Clarke in 'Minnows and 
Tritons' (Dodd, Mead & Co.), the little chap having 
the most exhilarating adventures with wild animals 
and robbers during the process. 

The second volume of Mr. Edward S. 
oradvenZre ^^^^^'^ 'Colonial Series' is called 

'Cromwell of Virginia: A Story of 
Bacon's Eebellion' (Coatee), and it utilizes afresh 
some of the characters of 'An American King,' 
published last year. An interesting struggle indi- 
cative of the high spirit of the settlers which was 
eventually to win them independence occupies the 
narrative. — How a small family of boys and girls 
defended their home in their father's absence dur- 
ing the last French and Indian war makes the 
exciting topic of Mr. James Otis's 'Defending the 
Island: A Story of Bar Harbor in 1758' (Estes). 

— A new volume in the 'Holly Tree Series' is Mr. 
H. Irving Hancock's 'Chuggins, the Youngest Hero 
in the Army: A Tale of the Capture of Santiago' 
(Altemus). It is a convincing account of what 
befell a lad of thirteen who wished to fight because 
his ancestors had, and who made his way to Cuba 
as a stowaway. The colored frontispiece and other 
illustrations are by Mr. J. C. Claghorn. — We come 
almost to contemporary affairs in Mr. Edward 
Stratemeyer 's 'Under the Mikado's Flag; or, Young 
Soldiers of Fortune' (Lee & Shepard). The boy 
heroes already known to readers of previous vol- 
umes in Mr. Stratemeyer 's 'Old Glory Series' are 
in Korea when the present war with Russia breaks 
forth, and they follow the fortunes of the Japanese 
through the battle of Liao-Yang. 

It would be a queer sort of child 
indeed that could resist the charm of 
the little animal books written and 
illustrated in color by Miss Beatrix Potter. 'The 
Tale of Benjamin Bunny' and 'The Tale of Two Bad 
Mice' are the titles of this year's additions to the 



Oood books 
of all sorts, 



list. For smaller children nothing more delightful 
in their own unique way could possibly be found. 
Messrs. F. Warne & Co. publish the series. — Mr. 
Gelett Burgess's cheerful and fascinating Goops 
reappear this season in a volume comprehensively 
entitled 'Goop Tales Alphabetically Told: A Study 
of the Behavior of some Fifty-Two Individuals, 
Each of which, while Mainly Virtuous, yet has 
some One Human and Redeeming Fault' (Stokes). 
While children can hardly fail to enjoy the peculiar 
Goop characteristics, we fancy that Mr, Burgess's 
clever drawings and verses will make their strong- 
est appeal to the ' grown-up. ' — A book of fairy tales 
from the versatile pen of the late Thomas Dunn 
English is among the pleasant surprises of the sea- 
son. It is called 'The Little Giant, The Big Dwarf, 
and Two Other Wonder Tales' (McClurg), and is 
addressed to 'boys and girls from eight to eighty 
years old.' The 'two other' tales are 'The Four 
Rescues' and 'The Adventures of Wydawayk,' this 
last now appearing in print for the first time. Ail 
the stories are quaint and humorous in the best 
sense of those words, and their effect is greatly 
heightened by the graceful drawings of Mrs. Lucy 
Fitch Perkins. — Another admirable book intended 
for small children is Mrs. Mary Austin's 'The 
Basket Woman' (Houghton, Mifflin & Co.), in which 
are told a number of fanciful tales based upon 
Indian myths of the California desert. The book is 
marked throughout by imagination and literary 
skill, and the whole effect is delightful. — Mrs. 
Frances Trego Montgomery's 'On a Lark to the 
Planets' (Saalfield) is a sequel to last year's 
' Wonderful Electric Elephant. ' In the new book the 
children take a ballon trip as far as the Milky 
Way, talk with the classical gods, and have adven- 
tures many and various before their safe return to 
earth. The illustrations in color are by Miss Wini- 
fred D. Elrod. — Of the simplest words of one 
syllable Miss Clara Murray has composed the little 
stories in her book called 'The Child at Play' (Lit- 
tle, Brown & Co.). The tales are intended for very 
small children indeed, and there are suitable pic- 
tures in color by Mr. Hermann Hayer. — Rev. 
Augustus Mendon Lord has written a delightful 
little account of children all over Europe in his 
book entitled 'The Touch of Nature: Little Stories 
of Great People' (American Unitarian Association). 
Child life in Italy, Spain, Hungary, Ireland, and 
many other countries is here described in a way 
to appeal strongly to the young mind. — Of a simi- 
lar sort, but going much farther afield in its range, 
in Miss Lulu Maude Chance's 'Little Folks of Many 
Lands' (Ginn). The book is fully illustrated.' — 
In 'The Story of a Mission Indian; or, Sunshine in 
a Dark Place' (Badger), Miss Kathryn Wallace has 
depicted the life led by the Indian children in the 
California missions before the coming of the Anglo- 
Saxon. The book will perform a praiseworthy 
service in telling the shameful truth of the treat- 
ment accorded these once happy people. 



Dr. Edward Cannan of the University of London 
has edited for modern students of economics the 
greatest of all economic classics — ' An Inquiry into 
the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations.' 
The text is that of the fifth edition, carefully 
collated with the others. The notes and commen- 
taries of the editor are judicious and reverential, 
and are just what the modern student needs as 
a guide for the study of Adam Smith. The edition 
is in handsome library form, in two volumes, and 
is published in this country by Messrs. G. P. Put- 
nam 's Sons.

is the title of a work edited by Professor Edward

narrative of the Knight of Elvas and that of

There is also a life of the explorer by Mr. Buck-

Prominent among the contents of 'The Inter- 
national Studio' for December is a forcible article 
by Mr. R. Harold Paget relative to the proposed 
remodelling .and 'improvement' of the old State 
Capitol at Richmond, Virginia. In directing atten- 
tion to this particular instance of official desecra- 
tion, it is to be hoped that Mr, Paget 's article 
will have some effect in arousing national senti- 
ment to a realization of the fact that without 
the most active sort of. preventive measures many 
of our historic public buildings are likely to be 
obliterated within a very few years. :;.; i;.; ' y,Vl.

Two special bibliographies which librarians and 
others should find of value have lately been issued 
by Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. One is a * Classi- 
fied Catalogue of Scientific and Technological 
Books,' prepared by a committee of the Society 
for the Promotion of Engineering Education; the 
other is a list of 'Books and Helps for Nature 
Study,' compiled by Mr. D. Lange, Supervisor 
of Nature Study in the Public Schools of St. Paul. 

'An Irish-English Dictionary,' the work of the 
Rev. Patrick S. Dinneen, is published by Mr. David 
Nutt of London. It is a compilation of about 
twelve thousand words in the modern Irish lan- 
guage, with explanations in English, and should 
contribute materially to the renewed study of that 
idiom. There is an appendix of verbal paradigms. 
The work is of moderate size, although containing 
eight hundred pages, and is vouched for by Dr. 
Douglas Hyde and others of authority. 

Among the promised features of 'The Atlantic 
Monthly' during the coming year, the widest inter- 
est will undoubtedly centre upon the reproduction 
of Thoreau's hitherto unpublished Private Journal, 
as edited by Mr. Bradford Torrey. Entertainment 
of a rare sort may also be expected in the remin- 
iscences of Charles Godfrey Leland, from the pen 
of his niece and literary executor, Mrs. Elizabeth 
Robins Pennell, to appear under the title of 'Hans 
Breitmann Papers.' Besides these, there will be 
an anonymous series of 'Letters to Literary 
Statesmen,' a new serial by Miss Margaret Sher- 
wood, a connected group of historical articles by 
Prof. William Garrott Brown dealing with 'The 
Tenth Decade of the United States,' and the 
usual variety of stories, poems, and essays.

charming artistry . and fidelity to truth, the gay humor, readi- 
ness in conversational fence and repartee, and genuine womanliness 
of college girls. Writing from the vantage point of an active 
literary career, she has mingled in the most alluring proportions all the qualities of a "real book."
