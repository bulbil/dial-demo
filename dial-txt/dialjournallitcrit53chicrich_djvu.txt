Both Sides of the Shield 

By Major ARCHIBALD W. BUTT 

With a Foreword by WILLIAM H. TAFT, President of the United States, and a Short Account 

of the Author's Life 

" It is a book a man might well be proud to leave behind him, for it could only have been written by a man of 
fine mentality warmth of heart of true reverence for the best in womanhood and above all by a man in 
whose breast the flame of true patriotism brightly burned the patriotism that was natural to one who was a 
loyal son of the South, and a true American." The Augusta Chronicle. 

Frontispiece. 12mo. Cloth, $1.00 net; postpaid $1.10. 



The Penitent 



By RENE BAZIN 

Author of "The Nun " 

The visit of Rene 1 Bazin to America has aroused widespread interest in this immortal Frenchman's writings. " The Penitent " 
is an exquisite study of the peasant folk in Brittany, and the story of how Donatienne, the gay and pretty young wife, is led 
astray, and how she eventually returns to her stricken husband is one of unusual power and insight into human nature.

By WILL LEVINGTON COMFORT 

Author of"Boutledge Bides Alone " (Nine Editions')

Miserables.' " Edwin Markham.

TWO NOTABLE NEW BIOGRAPHIES 



Victor Hugo: His Life and Work Goethe: The Man and His Character

personal English study of Victor Hugo yet issued.

ment of his artistic genius.

CONVENTION MUSINGS. 

The political doings of the past fortnight 
would seem to provide a suitable occasion for a 
few reflections upon the relation between lit- 
erature and life, or upon the revelations of 
national character which are made during sea- 
sons of excitement both of which subjects 
come within the scope of a journal like ours. 
From a literary point of view, one of the two 
opposing chieftains in the factional republican 
struggle now happily past its first crisis may 
be regarded as a negligible quantity, whose 
writings are likely to be preserved only in some 
future edition of " Messages of the Presidents " 
preserved and entombed, as is the fate of 
such compositions. But with the other the case 
is different. Not only is he the " contributing 
editor '* to a popular organ of sterilized culture, 
but he is also an author of respectable rank, 
whose dozen or more volumes have rightfully 
earned for him the distinction of election to 
the American Academy of Arts and Letters, 
making him one of the Fifty whose names are 
(more or less) household words in circles where 
intellectual and artistic interests are held to be 
of importance. He illustrates, among other 
things, the danger, which ever lurks in the path 
of the politician, of expressing views in print 
which it is afterwards most inconvenient to have 
tactless persons recall for the purpose of refuting 
his latest set of opinions out of his own mouth. 
It must be indeed galling to a candidate for 
popular favor, after he has formulated and ex- 
pressed the life-long convictions that are clearly 
demanded by the exigencies of his immediate 
political situation, to be confronted with quota- 
tions from his own books, in which diametrically 
opposite convictions are voiced with the same 
apparent fervor and sincerity. 

Mr. Roosevelt has experienced this sort of 
discomfiture on many occasions, and has be- 
come an adept in the art of defending his own 
reversals of judgment, and making the worse 
appear the better reason when expediency coun- 
sels such a logical masquerade. A correspon- 
dent of the New York " Nation " has recently 
given him a fairly hard nut to crack, shaken 
from the tree of his earlier writings. The pas- 
sage is from the life of Gouverneur Morris, who, 
we are told, 
" Denounced with a fierce scorn that they richly merit, 



THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



the despicable demagogues and witless fools who 
teach that in all cases the voice of the majority must 
be implicitly obeyed, and that public men have only 
to carry out its will, and thus ' acknowledge themselves 
the willing instruments of folly and vice. They declare 
that, in order to please the people, they will, regard- 
less alike of what conscience may dictate or reason 
approve, make the profligate sacrifice of public right on 
the altar of private interest. What more can be asked 
by the sternest tyrant of the most despicable slave ? 
Creatures of this sort are the tools which usurpers em- 
ploy in building despotism.' Sounder and truer maxims 
never were uttered. " 

The appeal from Philip drunk to Philip sober 
which this citation prompts has now, however, 
to reckon with a conscience so elastic and a 
sophistry so barefaced that they dare attempt 
to justify such a shameless act as the rape of 
Colombia in defiance of every dictate of inter- 
national good faith. The only plea ever made 
by the author of that outrage in its extenuation 
is that it was committed " to please the people." 
Those who are not satisfied with this plea or with 
its author's attempts to justify many another in- 
defensible act or tortuous policy, have no need to 
echo the wish " that mine adversary had written 
a book." The books are there, for anyone to 
read, and they throw a most revealing light 
upon the workings of the opportunist mind to 
which principles are but playthings, or pretexts 
for the exercise of ingenious casuistry. The 
game is too easy in this case, for their author 
has himself furnished a running ironical com- 
mentary upon most of the incidents of his later 
career. 

Literature provides many suggestive parallels 
to the words and acts of the now discomfited 
leader. The Homeric student will be reminded, 
here of Achilles sulking in his tent, there of 
Thersites and his railings. The satire of Juvenal 
and the indignation of Tacitus find in him a 
predestined mark. Milton supplies many apt 
texts, such as 

" The strongest and the fiercest spirit 
That fought in heaven, now fiercer by despair," 

and 

" His form had not yet lost 
All her original brightness, nor appeared 
Less than archangel ruined," 

which seems to fit the leader's case; or these 
that might be applied to his frenzied supporters 
in the Convention : 

" The universal host upsent 
A shout that tore hell's concave, and beyond 
Frighted the reign of Chaos and old Night," 

and 

" When night 

Darkens the street, then wander forth the sons 
Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine." 



In the mouthings of Jack Cade, Shakespeare has 
limned the demagogue for all times, and Cade's 
declared purpose to hang all the lawyers is only a 
blunt way of stating the hatred of legal restraint 
which has been so ominous a feature of the recent 
agitation against the constitutional safeguards 
of order. Shelley's " Mask of Anarchy " yields 
the following stanza, which is not without its 
suggestiveness : 

"And he wore a kingly crown; 

And in his grasp a sceptre shone ; 

On his brow this mark I saw 
1 1 am God, and King, and Law ! ' " 

Perhaps the most apposite of all these literary 
parallels is that to be found in Dante's " Para- 
diso," where the poet is informed by Cacciaguida 
of the evil company into which he is destined to 
fall, and is told that he will be well-advised to 
become his own political party. " Of its besti- 
ality, its own procedure will give the proof; so 
that it will be seemly for thee to have made 
thyself a party by thyself." 

Turning from the aggressive personality which 
has been so conspicuously to the fore of late, and 
looking at the Convention turbulence as a reve- 
lation of national character, we are prompted to 
some grave reflections. After making a liberal 
allowance for the exuberance of youth and the 
ebullition of party feeling, after indulgently ac- 
counting for many distasteful happenings on 
the ground that a large section of the American 
public regards politics as a form of sport, and 
has no inclination to deal with it in a serious 
and sober fashion, there nevertheless remains a 
condition which should give pause to our optim- 
ism and lead us to a searching self-examination. 
Is it really necessary, even in a presidential year r 
that reason should abdicate almost altogether in 
favor of impulse and emotion? If we let our- 
selves go in this fashion too often, may we not 
some time be carried so far that our balance will 
be regained only at the terrible cost of bloodshed 
and the overthrow of social order? We got into 
that position half a century ago, and the results 
were appalling. Civilization at best is but a 
thin crust beneath which the primal forces of 
human nature greed and passion are seeth- 
ing in the effort to find vent. Whoever seeks 
to weaken that restraining shell has small appre- 
ciation of the forces that may be unloosed if it 
once breaks. We are at all times nearer than 
we think to 

" Red ruin, and the breaking up of laws." 

The Anglo-Saxon peoples have ever prided 
themselves on their self-restraint upon critical 
occasions, and in their devotion to the principle

of " laws, not men " in the ordering of their 
political life. But the English people were 
rudely aroused from their pharisaical self- 
sufficiency by the ugly demonstrations of 
" mafficking," and who can say that, under a 
similar excitement, the American people would 
not lose their heads to even more disastrous 
effect ? That " added drop of nervous fluid " 
which Colonel Higginson used to talk about as 
differentiating us from our English cousins may 
sometime prove a menace to our social stability. 
We already enjoy the international reputation 
of being a strikingly lawless community, and 
our statistics of homicide are so appalling that 
we cannot comtemplate them without hiding 
our heads in shame. The frenzied passions, 
the charges and counter-charges, and the con- 
tempt for law, that have characterized this 
Convention period have been deeply humiliating 
to all sober-minded Americans, who have felt 
like exclaiming " A plague on both your 
houses!" to the two political parties and to 
the two warring factions in each of them. The 
spectacle has not only been humiliating but 
ominous, and few can have failed to be reminded 
of the resemblance to the situation which a 
quarter of a century ago came near to over- 
throwing the French Republic in the interests 
of General Boulanger, and which sixty years 
ago witnessed its actual overthrow by a self- 
acclaimed " savior of society." Not a few of us 
have trembled at the possibility that this chap- 
ter of French history might be provided with 
a parallel in the history of our own republic. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



THE GENDER OF BOOKS is sometimes as marked 
as the gender of human beings. Some books have a 
masculine strength, and some a feminine grace and 
tenderness. " Daniel Deronda " and " Felix Holt " 
and "Jane Eyre," though written by women, are 
marked by virility rather than by femininity. " The 
Essays of Elia" and "Marius the Epicurean " do 
not fall in the class of rugged masculine books; no 
one would place them beside Borrow's "Lavengro," 
Burton's "Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah," 
or Scott's Waverley novels* Certain studies, too, have 
the softness of the gentle sex rather than the hardness 
of the sterner one. Professor Earl Barnes, discours- 
ing in the June "Atlantic" on "The Feminization of 
Culture," finds what seems to him rather disquieting 
evidence that our system of education is losing its 
virile qualities and becoming unduly feminine in 
character. He considers it "taken for granted 
that, in education, feminization means emphasis on 
languages, literature, and history, as opposed to 



mathematics, physics, chemistry, and civics." In 
general, the abstract presents itself to him in female 
garb, the concrete in male attire. The fine arts are, 
of course, feminine, the sciences masculine. Sta- 
tistics from high schools and seminaries for the last 
two decades are examined by the writer, and he 
finds that the study of Latin, for example, has in 
that time increased fifteen per cent, French four per 
cent, German thirteen per cent, European history 
twenty-seven per cent, and English literature (since 
1901) seven per cent. Physics, chemistry, physical 
geography, physiology, and civics have all fallen off 
at rates varying from three to fifteen per cent. "A 
careful study of these figures," he maintains, "must 
convince any fair-minded person that our school cur- 
riculum, even in the secondary field where women's 
control is least complete, is moving rapidly in the 
direction of what we have called feminization." 
Nevertheless, it is probable that not all his readers 
will allow their slumbers to be disturbed by this 
demonstration of tendencies in current culture. 
There is a grain of comfort in the fact that not 
even the difficulties of Latin have caused a decline 
in its vogue, nor the easiness of French greatly 
increased the popularity of Moliere's tongue. Latin 
has gained fifteen per cent, and the rugged Teutonic 
tongue has gained thirteen. English literature, the 
"softest snap" of all, has advanced only four per 
cent in ten years. And even if the whole statistical 
showing were much more impressive than it is, can- 
not the finer qualities of manhood as well as the more 
admirable qualities of womanhood be nurtured on 
gentle studies ? Must one study bridge-building and 
mining engineering in order to escape becoming a 
milksop or a mollycoddle ? But perhaps the best reply 
to the alarmist is now being made by Minnesota, 
where more than fifty thousand persons are taking 
university extension courses, in which such mascu- 
line studies as sociology and economics are enjoying 
the highest favor. 

BRINGING BOOKS TO BOOKLESS PEOPLE to the 
dwellers in rural communities whose remoteness 
from public libraries deprives them almost wholly of 
library advantages is just now a subject of very 
lively interest in the library world. It was the dom- 
inant theme at the Convention of County Librarians 
held in connection with the June meeting of the 
California State Library Association at Lake Tahoe. 
California has recently enacted some very good laws 
for systematic "library extension" work in that State 
through the agency of County Free Libraries, under 
whose direction books are sent to remote commu- 
nities, very much as letters are sent there by the 
Rural Free Delivery. This system has now been on 
trial long enough to make the detailed reports of its 
practical operation, such as were presented at the 
Lake Tahoe conference, of special significance. The 
system is of course still in its experimental stages as 
to details and methods, but the intelligent and often 
enthusiastic reports of those who have been engaged 
in the work leave no room for doubt as to its gen-

eral success and its future importance as a branch of 
the general system of popular education in this coun- 
try. Particularly telling, and often touching, were 
the instances related of the joy and gratitude of 
people living in remote mountain regions, to whom 
the arrival of a dozen books is an event in the life of 
a community whose hunger for books could hardly 
be met in any other way than by these periodical dis- 
pensations from the county library. It was noticeable 
at the Tahoe meeting, as at other recent gatherings 
of librarians, that problems of library administration 
received but scant attention, matters relating to the 
widening of the library's sphere and the extension 
of its benefits being clearly in the foreground. This 
was illustrated throughout the reports and discus- 
sions, and was the key-note of an excellent talk on 
the influence of museums and art-galleries as auxil- 
iaries of the public library, by Mr. C. S. Greene, of 
the Free Public Library at Oakland. 


A LITERARY EVENT of an unusual nature, and, in 
strict accuracy, more an athletic than a purely liter- 
ary event, was the spirited contest, on Lincoln Field 
at Providence, between the forces of "The Brown 
Herald" and "The Brunonian," in a game of base- 
ball, umpired by the president-elect of Amherst Col- 
lege, Dr. Alexander Meiklejohn, who with the close 
of the present academic year relinquishes his office 
of Dean at Brown University to assume the larger 
duties awaiting him at the sister institution in the 
Connecticut valley. His election to the Amherst 
presidency may itself be regarded as an event in the 
world of letters, so ardent a zeal has he shown for 
that form of learning which is something more than 
a mere vocational training or specialist's grind. Dis- 
approving the increasing latitude of the elective sys- 
tem, which, he is said to have declared, has brought 
with it "educational chaos," he cannot but find him- 
self heartily in accord with Amherst's spirit of reac- 
tion and of reversion to the older ideals of liberal 
culture. It was Dr. Meiklejohn who took the initia- 
tive in shaping the new course at Brown leading to 
the degree of bachelor of philosophy, a course which 
he tersely described as " a vigorous attempt to single 
out and to require the most significant and funda- 
mental elements of human culture." Another quo- 
table utterance from the same source, delivered in an 
address before the Brown alumni of Boston last year, 
will here be not out of order. "I have lately heard 
a correction of an old saying, ' You can drive a horse 
to water, but you can't make him drink.' 'No,' it 
was added, 'but you can make him thirsty.' Just so 
you can't force boys into learning, but if your zeal 
be hot enough you can develop a thirst. To do that 
is to win." ... 

THE MYSTERIES OF LIBRARIANSHIP let the 

word "mysteries" be here understood in its Greek 
sense are probably mysteries indeed to. the great 
general public, no large fraction of whom ever gets 
so far toward an initiation into them as to give them 
even a passing thought. Library administration, 



systems of cataloguing, shelf-listing, accessions-lists, 
charging systems, fixed location, decimal classifica- 
tion, all these and many other terms familiar to the 
initiated are vague or meaningless technicalities to 
those unversed in library science. Consequently a 
sentence or two from the current " Circular of Infor- 
mation " issued by the Library Training School of the 
Carnegie Library of Atlanta one of our most ac- 
tive and enterprising institutions of the sort, despite 
its location in the sultry South may have for the 
casual reader the charm at least of novelty. Under 
"Course of Study" it is announced that "especial 
attention is given to administrative work, including 
the study of plans for small buildings and the details 
of organization of new libraries continually springing 
up in this section." Also, " In addition to the strictly 
technical subjects the course includes the study of the 
English novel, tracing its sources; the appraisal of 
fiction, English and foreign; the survey of the li- 
braiy field, enabling the students to keep pace with 
the leading movements of the library world; field 
work, consisting of visits of observation to other 
libraries; and the history of printing." Almost a 
liberal education is here outlined, one would say, 
and not simply a narrow technical training out of 
touch with the warm and living interests of hu- 
manity at large. 

THE CAUSE OF CULTURE IN THE SOUTH has of 
late received much encouraging support, both moral 
and material. Conspicuous among recent gifts of 
money is the fund of a quarter-million dollars voted 
by the General Education Board to the George 
Peabody College for Teachers, at Nashville, in 
memory of the life and work of the late Dr. Seaman 
A. Knapp, the organizer of cooperative demonstra- 
tion work, the promoter of boys' corn clubs and 
girls' canning clubs, the successful fighter against 
the boll weevil, and the advocate of diversified 
farming, deeper ploughing, and increased stock- 
raising. This same Teachers' College, which is 
the successor to the Peabody Normal College, but 
planned on a larger scale, has lately received one 
million dollars from the Peabody Educational Fund, 
and other considerable gifts from the state, the 
county, and the city in which it is situated. Also, 
the trustees of the Peabody Fund, who have voted 
"to close the Trust and to distribute the moneys 
remaining in their hands," have offered to endow the 
College with an additional gift of half a million 
dollars, provided that before November 1, 1913, the 
College raise the further sum of one million dollars. 
The graduates themselves*, teachers earning salaries 
that average not over four hundred dollars a year, 
have pledged themselves to raise a fifth part of this 
required million, but for the remaining four-fifths 
the wealthier friends of Southern education are 
asked and expected to open their purses. A " State- 
ment and Appeal," signed by the Hon. Joseph H. 
Choate and the Hon. Samuel A. Green for the 
Trustees of the Peabody Educational Fund, invites 
subscriptions, and requests that all communications

Teachers, Nashville, Tennessee. 

THE SCHOLAR'S CONSCIENCE ought to be pecul- 
iarly sensitive, inasmuch as he, far more than the un- 
thinking, uncritical, carelessly observing person, has 
abundant opportunity to learn from his studies how 
futile and foolish in the long run are all evasions of 
either intellectual or moral truth, all dishonorable sub- 
terfuges, all attempted short-cuts to the good things 
of life. And yet we who use public libraries know 
that we have among us not a few book-thieves who 
pass in the world as persons of liberal culture. Even 
the highly-educated and intellectually-accomplished 
biblioklept is not unknown. On the open shelves 
near the centre desk in Bates Hall, at the Boston 
Public Library, are temporarily displayed the more 
recent accessions in literature of a more serious and 
scholarly character than the average reader is inter- 
ested in; and to these shelves resort each day the 
serious and the bespectacled students whom such a 
display naturally attracts. But, as is regretfully 
recorded in the library's latest Report, "the loss of 
books by theft from these shelves, affecting as it does 
new books, just published and in active demand, has 
become so great that, in the public interest, a new 
arrangement with some limitation upon freedom of 
access is required. It is proposed to place such 
books upon guarded shelving in the delivery room, 
immediately under the control of an attendant, to 
permit anyone to examine them upon request, but 
to require the use of a call slip before they can be re- 
moved to the reading tables." Not even the soothing 
conjecture that these thefts have been mostly effected 
by the unscholarly for purposes of pecuniary gain is 
tenable, since the perforated stamp and other marks 
of ownership make the books difficult of sale. It 
must be sadly admitted that a love of good literature 
is not incompatible with schemes for its unlawful 
acquisition. ... 

AN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION LAUNCHED WITH 

A WARNING to the public to think twice before pat- 
ronizing it would seem destined, according to the 
theories of our modern promoters, to a short and 
circumscribed career. Yet Mount Holyoke Col- 
lege, which plans to celebrate in October next the 
seventy-fifth anniversary of its founding, was first 
advertised on a strictly look-before-you-leap basis. 
In a pink-covered pamphlet that bears the imprint 
of South Hadley, 1835, Mary Lyon wrote: "It is 
very desirable that friends of this cause should 
carefully consider the real design of founding this 
institution before they use their influence to induce 
any of their friends and acquaintances to avail 
themselves of its privileges." " Harmless cumberers 
of the ground" were notified that they would be 
persona non grata, in the new type of woman's 
school. It was "to meet public, not private, wants"; 
to send forth women "to exert power over society 
which cannot be exerted by mere goodness without 
intellectual strength." Such a type of school ap- 



pears to have required a good deal of explanation to 
make the idea of it intelligible to the public of 1837. 
So perhaps its hard-headed builder did well to fling 
out warning rather than inducement. Otherwise the 
young Mount Holyoke might have been swamped 
under a rush of utterly unfit students ; and the edu- 
cational world, instead of gathering in October to 
honor this first small beginning of colleges for 
women, would pass heedlessly over the grave of 
another idea born too soon. 

THE SHY " HOMER OF THE INSECTS," as the au- 
thor of " The Life of the Bee " and " The Blue Bird " 
has called the nonagenarian French naturalist, M. J. 
Henri Fabre, whom Mr. Frank Harris has styled 
"the wisest man and certainly the best read in the 
books of nature of whom the centuries have left us 
any record," is likely soon to become better known

the issue of a complete edition, in our language, of 
his fascinating " Entomological Memories." A nona- 
genarian he is not quite yet, to be accurate, for he 
was born in 1823, but the indications point encour- 
agingly to his attainment of that and even of a riper 
age. The story of his lowly birth, of his long strug- 
gle with poverty before he could devote himself to 
his beloved insects, of his shyness and his panic-fear 
of public recognition, and of his warm attachment 
to his native Provence, rivals in interest anything 
that his own gifted pen has produced. His life, 
like all great and noble lives, has had its keen dis- 
appointments, its crushing sorrows. In his struggle 
to win the independence that should leave him at 
liberty to pursue his chosen studies, he was once on 
the verge of an important invention that promised 
him a handsome fortune. He had perfected a 
process for extracting dye from the madder, a fac- 
tory was being built, and an assured income seemed 
all but within his grasp, when a heartless chemist 
discovered a cheap artificial substitute for the nat- 
ural dye, and all the high hopes of the entomologist 
fell to the ground and thus was wrought, it may 
be, a fortunate deliverance from the clutch of com- 
merce. . . . 

A GREEK PLAT IN THE OPEN AIR, after the man- 
ner of the ancients, was one of the commencement 
events of the season. The young ladies of Rose- 
mary Hall, at Greenwich, Connecticut, presented the 
"Alcestis" of Euripides, in Mr. Arthur S. Way's 
excellent metrical version, under the trees of the 
school orchard, and, let us imagine, to the accom- 
paniment of the feathered musicians there having 
their abode. Not the least interesting feature of 
the entertainment was the devotion of the pecuniary 
proceeds 'to the newly-planned Connecticut College 
for Women. The recent exclusion of women from 
Wesleyan University (at Middletown) has made it 
necessary for Connecticut girls desiring a college edu- 
cation to seek it beyond the borders of the Nutmeg 
State. Agitation for a girls' college within these 
borders was started by certain Hartford women of 
light and leading, and ere long the movement spread

over the commonwealth until New London felt 
prompted to offer a site for such a college, with a 
grant of fifty thousand dollars. Acceptance of this 
generosity was not slow to follow, and then Mr. 
Morton F. Plant contributed a handsome endowment 
fund of a million dollars. A commensurate building 
fund is now the crying need, and it was to help raise 
this that the Greek play was presented by the stu- 
dents of Rosemary Hall. 



WELL-EARNED ACADEMIC HONORS TO MEN OF 
LETTERS are to be noted as one glances over the sea- 
son's list of degrees conferred ; and no one has more 
richly deserved the decorative letters indicating such 
honors than Mr. Howells, who is now entitled to write 
"L.H.D. (Princeton)" after his name. "The dean 
of the guild of belles-lettres in America " is Prince- 
ton's appropriate designation of the distinguished 
author. No less appropriately it characterizes Dr. 
James Ford Rhodes as "our first living American 
political historian," and emphasizes the characteri- 
zation by making him a doctor of laws. Of course in 
both these instances this is a betitling of the already 
much-betitled, and one is reminded of the witty re- 
joinder of another eminent man of letters (our fore- 
most Shakespeare scholar, to be more definite) who, 
on having his attention called to the fact that he 
was decorated with about all the coveted academic 
initials in vogue, but was not yet a D.D., instantly 

replied: "Oh, I am that too; I'm d d deaf" a 

rejoinder to which the ear-trumpet, carried now for 
some weary decades by the speaker, gave manifest 
point. . . . 

A NORMAL COURSE IN LIBRARY TRAINING is 

announced as a new departure at the Pratt Institute 
School of Library Science. The purpose of the 
course, which will first be offered in 1912-13, is 
"to prepare students to teach in library schools, to 
take charge of training classes or school depart- 
ments in public library systems, and for librarianship 
in normal schools or other educational institutions 
where courses in library science are given. The 
experience of those who have had to seek trained 
library workers who are also qualified to teach 
library science shows that the required combination 
of qualifications is extremely difficult to find among 
the members of the profession. Furthermore, there 
is an increasing number of positions to be filled due 
to the development of library schools and the grow- 
ing demand for trained service in all libraries." 
A descriptive outline of the course is issued by the 
school. ... 

ONE WAY TO ADVERTISE A PUBLIC LIBRARY, a Way 

that will not have occurred to all librarians, comes 
to our attention in turning the interesting pages of 
the " Minnesota Library Commission Library Notes 
and News." In the June number a news item from 
Owatonna reports that "the librarian has been 
doing some effective work in advertising the library 
throughout the county. One of the ministers at 
Deerfield devoted a Sunday sermon to the Library 
and its work, and distributed the leaflets 'Don't be a 



quitter.'" The library and the school are becoming 
every day more closely and usefully affiliated ; why, 
then, may not the library and the church join 
forces, wherever practicable and as opportunity pre- 
sents itself, in the work of mental and moral uplift ? 



COMMUNICA TION. 



SHAKESPEARE IN JAPANESE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

One evidence of the universality of the genius of 
Shakespeare is to be found in the fact that his dramas 
are translated into so many different languages all over 
the world. This is true not only of the Indo-European 
tongues that are so nearly related to the English, but 
also of Semitic and Turanian languages that are not thus 
closely related to our own. It seems to be an axiom 
that Shakespeare put into expression the common uni- 
versal human feelings, which can be translated from 
one language to another without great difficulty. 

This is not saying that literal translation is possible. 
It is, of course, necessary to adapt more or less, accord- 
ing to circumstances, to cut out, to add, to explain. 
Absolutely literal word-for-word translations are much 
less in vogue than formerly; it is not the form, but the 
spirit, that is important. " The letter killeth, but the 
spirit giveth life." 

This is the sort of translation of Shakespeare that Dr. 
Tsubouchi is giving to the Japanese. He is himself a 
fine Shakespearean scholar, sensitive and appreciative; 
and he seems to know how to interest others, for his 
lectures on Shakespeare at Waseda University are so 
popular that students scarcely have standing room. 

Dr. Tsubouchi has recently published his fourth trans- 
lation of a Shakespearean drama. The first three were 
" Hamlet," " Othello," and " Romeo and Juliet " ; and the 
fourth is " King Lear." He has also translated portions 
of other plays, such as "The Tempest," " The Merchant 
of Venice," etc. We have often thought that the Japa- 
nese would take naturally to " King Lear," because the 
motive of filial piety is so strong in Japan and other 
countries of the Orient. We have doubted whether 
" Romeo and Juliet " would be successful here, unless 
the sentimental love-scenes were toned down and modi- 
fied considerably on the stage. 

It has been suggested, not without reason, that, " as 
Japan has so recently emerged from the feudal age," 
" the modern Japanese can understand the spirit of 
Elizabeth's time better even than the present-day peo- 
ple of England." The same writer also says: "That 
Shakespeare has taken deep root in the dramatic soil of 
Japan is evidenced by the remarkable interest that has 
recently been shown in the great English dramatist." 
The court scene in " The Merchant of Venice " is one in 
which Japanese actors feel not a little at home, partly 
on account of the formalities demanded by the occasion. 
And a man in Portia's part as a lawyer is not out of 
place ! 

It is pleasant to be able to add, in conclusion, that 
the work of Dr. Tsubouchi meets with suitable recogni- 
tion. The newly organized Institute of Literature and 
Arts made its very first award, in the forms of a diploma, 
a bronze medal, and the sum of 2,200 yen ($1,100), to 
this great Shakespearean scholar.

"THE PEOPLE'S ATTORNEY."* 

But for the fact that Henry Demarest Lloyd 
was not yet born when the words were uttered, 
Emerson might have had him in mind when he 
said: "The face which character wears to me 
is self -sufficingn ess. I revere the person who has 
riches ; so that I cannot think of him as alone, 
or poor, or exiled, or unhappy, or a client, but 
as perpetual patron, benefactor, and beatified 
man." 

In her life of her brother, now, nearly nine 
years after his too- early death, issued in two 
handsome volumes, a beautifully appreciative 
and in every way worthy tribute to his memory, 
his sister draws with the hand of sympathy and 
affection the noble outlines and the lovable traits 
of a character such as might well prompt one to 
exclaim, paraphrasing the old poet, "He had his 
faults, perhaps ; I wish I had them too ! " In his 
biographer's words, " his personality was happily 
so proper an expression of his spirit that men 
and women loved him at first sight. Some who 
saw him only once spoke of him ever after with 
a kind of exaltation. Many loved him who never 
saw him, as one who said, ' I never had the un- 
speakable joy of looking upon his face.' " 

Mr. Lloyd was born May 1, 1847, the first 
child of Aaron Lloyd, minister of the Dutch Re- 
formed Church, and Maria Christie Demarest. 
It was at the home of his mother's father, David 
Demarest, in Sixth Avenue, New York, that he 
achieved his entrance into the world, and in that 
city most of his early life was passed. There he 
went to school and college, and there he prepared 
himself for the practice of the law. His father, 
having no pulpit at the time, had tried to make a 
living as a bookseller, starting an " Olde Booke 
Store" in Nassau Street, and afterward remov- 
ing to busier Broadway. But it was a hard fight, 
and the boys of the family had to work their 
own way in large part. The Mercantile Library 
gave them employment out of school-hours, and 
at the same time ministered to their love of read- 
ing. A scholarship at Columbia, with the earn- 
ings of his hours snatched from study, enabled 
Henry to finish his academic and his legal edu- 
cation, after which journalism, book- writing, re- 
form movements, and other interests of a nature 
to appeal to one so generously devoted to the

Russell. In two volumes. Illustrated. New York: G. P. 
Putnam's Sons. 



good of humanity, engrossed his attention and 
left him little time or inclination for the narrower 
field of the law. In fact, his " first case," as he 
called it, did not come to him until 1902, when 
the anthracite coal miners' strike enlisted his 
sympathies and he took part in the proceedings 
of the arbitration court at Scranton. His work 
as a journalist, largely as a writer of editorials 
on questions of the day, began in New York, 
but was continued in Chicago from the autumn 
of 1872, when he formed a connection with the 
"Tribune"of that city, beginning as a paragraph- 
writer, then being placed in charge of the liter- 
ary department, and before many years rising 
to the dignity of leader-writer. 

But the things for which he will long be 
remembered are the unpaid and at the time too 
little appreciated services rendered to his fellow- 
men wherever they were seen to be in need of an 
eloquent and fearless advocate and champion. 
The Pullman strikers, the Spring Valley miners, 
the so-called anarchists of the Haymarket trag- 
edy of 1886, the struggling People's Party of a 
few years later, the workers for municipal own- 
ership of public utilities, these and other fighters 
found in him a valiant leader whose utter disre- 
gard of his own personal interests is illustrated 
by his cheerfully risking the loss of fortune and 
the estrangement of friends which did not fail 
to follow upon his defense of the unfortunate 
men who suffered capital punishment because 
of the explosion of a bomb thrown by an un- 
known hand. It was impossible for him not to 
take sides with the under dog ; and -Mrs. Lloyd 
was always with him, heart and soul. When 
the probability of her father's extreme displeas- 
ure at her husband's course was pointed out to 
her, she replied : " Do you suppose that any 
such consideration will stop Henry Lloyd from 
doing what he believes is right?" The warn- 
ing, as appeared later, was no idle one. 

"In conseqence of their course, the Lloyds suffered 
the loss of fortune. Between Henry Lloyd and his 
father-in-law there had always existed sincere respect 
and affection which made this honest difference all the 
more painful. Mr. Bross declared that Mr. Lloyd had 
disgraced the family. The ample fortune was entailed 
to the grandchildren, and Mr. and Mrs. Lloyd were not 
entrusted with the guardianship nor the care of the 
property of their children, a sting even more keen than 
the financial loss." 

In connection with Mr. Lloyd's early and 
ardent espousal of the cause of labor, of the 
right of laborers to organize for mutual defense, 
it is worth while to quote here a few words 
defining his position as a peaceful but uncom- 
promising trades-unionist, or labor-unionist. To 



12

him, says his biographer, " the labor movement 
was not a movement of hate, but of love." In 
his own words : 

" It pities the man who can stand at the helm of any 
of the great concerns of modern industrial life, made 
possible only by the countless efforts, loyalty, and genius 
of thousands of his fellow men living and dead, and say, 
' This is my business.' It says to him, ' This is not your 
business, not my business. It is our business.' ... It 
pities him as robbing himself of the greatest joys and 
triumphs of leadership. It seeks to lift him from the low 
level of selfish and cruel milliouairism to that of a gen- 
eral of great cooperative hosts of industrial brothers." 

Probably there are many among Mr. Lloyd's 
warmest admirers who would hesitate to go all 
the way with him in his enthusiastic champion- 
ship of the cause of labor. In defending the 
sympathetic strike he draws illustrations, or 
analogies, from history, and puts the case thus : 

"Americans cannot forget that America is free from 
Great Britain because France ordered a sympathetic 
strike. The negro is free because of the sympathetic 
strike of the North. What greater love hath any man 
than this, that he lay down his life for his friend? The 
sympathetic strike in a good cause is orthodox Christian- 
ity in action." 

Following the successive events in Mr. 
Lloyd's strenuous advocacy of the people's 
rights, an advocacy that earned him his self- 
bestowed title of " the people's attorney," one 
is likely to receive the impression that he lived 
in an unusually troubled time. The financial 
panic of 1873 was followed by distress and 
unrest among the laboring classes. The year 
1877 was so marked by the occurrence of 
strikes that at one time no fewer than ten 
governors were calling for national troops to 
suppress disorder. We are inclined to regard 
the present period as one of unprecedented dis- 
content and turmoil, and unquestionably there 
is reason for grave apprehension unless the 
growing antagonism between capital and labor 
can be softened and the selfish greed of million- 
airedom be made to listen to reason ; but even 
in the " good old days " there were problems 
of this sort in plenty, as the book under review 
makes abundantly evident. From a chapter 
devoted to the late Governor Altgeld, a cordial 
friend and admirer of Mr. Lloyd, a short passage 
of the latter's writing calls for insertion here. 

"I was an eye-witness of Governor Altgeld's conduct 
during the great Pullman strike of 1894. ... I spent 
a number of hours with him at the most critical point 
of those eventful July days. Almost universally the 
American desires to treat even a political opponent with 
fairness and trust, however sharply he may criticise his 
opinions and actions. Not one of those who are so volu- 
bly joining in the fashionable denunciation of Governor 
Altgeld on account of what they believe, upon informa- 



tion at second hand, to have been his attitude and be- 
havior at that time would indulge in this hue and cry if 
they knew the facts." 

The facts which the writer of the foregoing is 
able to cite in refutation of the familiar charges 
against Altgeld are nothing short of convincing, 
and they cannot but leave the reader with a deep 
sense of the injustice suffered by one placed in 
a difficult public position, and with a feeling of 
admiration for the staunch friend who hastened 
to his defense. 

Concerning Mr. Lloyd's best-known piece of 
writing, the fraud-exposing, greed-condemning 
" Wealth against Commonwealth," there is here 
but little space to write. The sensation its 
appearance made is partly described in the fol- 
lowing : 

" From all parts of the land there now came to him 
the warm response from an unknown host whose eyes 
had never looked into his. Into the study where he had 
wrestled with his task, there came words of blessing, 
gratitude, courage from men whose ideals rose to meet 
his own. He began to feel the beat of the people's 
hearts. He woke to find his self-controlled method of 
recital producing the most startling effects. Men read 
the book with the same absorbing interest which as boys 
they gave to pirate stories. So exciting was it that they 
could read only a little at a time. . . . On all sides 
was echoed Edward Everett Hale's verdict, that it was 
an epoch-making book, an ' Uncle Tom's Cabin ' of the 
labor movement. ... It startled many Americans out 
of that comfortable assurance that, having the franchise, 
their liberties were secure. To lawyers it was partic- 
ularly convincing. Ministers and writers preached and 
wrote upon it, thrilled with a sense of the peril before 
the Republic. Robert Louis Stevenson decided to found 
a novel upon its disclosures. John Burroughs said that 
after an hour's reading he was so angry that he ' had to 
go out and kick stumps.' Those indeed were days when 
good men swore and even a minister confessed that he 
threw down the book and cried, < Damn those rascals.'" 

In illustration of the personal charm of this 
noble champion of the right who wore himself 
out at the age of fifty-six, and whose full tale 
of good works cannot here be even epitomized, 
many passages might be quoted from the biog- 
raphy; but one must suffice. 

" He himself, free from the restraint of the public ear, 
lavishly gave his thought however radical and his hopes 
however lofty or shy. His talk was brilliant and fasci- 
nating, full of startling prophecy, firm in its convictions ; 
it was now hard as steel, and now tender. It seethed 
with indignation. It touched earth, firm-footed, and 
again it soared, in a creative flight, far off into theory. 
It was interesting to see him throw out the line of a 
theory tentatively, so that he might watch its impression 
on various minds, testing its value, even prankishly see- 
ing how near he could come to the quick of his hearer's 
prejudices, tickling the talk, as it were. All was moreover 
touched with wit and suffused with grace and courtesy. 
Like Emerson's wise man he went to this game of conver- 
sation ' to play upon others and to be played upon.' "

The vehemence and ardor of the man are re- 
flected, in a curiously interesting way, in certain 
verbal short-cuts that arrest the attention in 
reading such passages from his writings as the 
book contains. The verb "re volute" is expedi- 
tiously formed by him from the noun " revolu- 
tion," and he uses the very convenient and 
self-explanatory "ambiguity." 

The biographer has done her work well, draw- 
ing upon many and sometimes not easily acces- 
sible sources for her rich store of information 
concerning the varied activities of her gifted 
brother. The illustrations are numerous and 
always closely related to the reading matter. Mr. 
Charles Edward Russell's introductory words 
help to illuminate the character portrayed in the 
chapters that follow. Appended matter, includ-

OSCAR, WILDE CRITICALLY STUDIED.* 

Modern literary criticism loves the exception. 
It delights in types like Wilde and Verlaine ; it 
is fond of flaunting its romantic individualism 
in a large contempt of prejudice. And being 
individualistic, it devotes itself all the more 
willingly to subjects in which a truly impartial 
attitude is to-day quite beyond our grasp. 

Thus Mr. Arthur Ransome follows up his 
work on Poe with "a critical study" of Oscar 
Wilde. The book is really an essay in biograph- 
ical interpretation. No man's work, as Mr. 
Ransome reminds us in his introductory chapter, 
can be treated as a mere disembodied result; and, 
in the case of Wilde, "whose books are the by- 
products of a life more important than they in 
his own eyes," a biographical criticism is "not 
only legitimate but necessary." The method is 
none the less most discreetly employed : a spirit 
of moderation characterizes, in the main, this 
study of one who, in spite of his life, has a cer- 
tain importance in the history of contemporary 
literature. 

For the present influence of Wilde is beyond 
question. "He has been translated into French, 
German, Italian, Spanish, Swedish, Yiddish, 
Polish, and Russian." (The statement prob- 
ably refers to separate works, possibly only to 
"Salome.") In his own country, says Mr. 
Ransome, " he left no form of literature exactly

as he found it. He brought back to the English 
stage a spirit of comedy that had been for many 
years in mourning. He showed both in practice 
and in theory the possibilities of creation open 
to the critic. He found a new use for dialogue, 
and brought to England a new variety of the 
novel." And so the volume takes up, one after 
the other, Wilde's various phases of literary 
activity, interpreting them by such reference to 
his life as the subject demands. 

The Poems receive a rather extended treat- 
ment. To be sure they constitute a literary debut, 
and every critic must take account of origins. 
Wilde's origins were numerous: his verses 
echo nearly every poet whose note impressed his 
ear. Mere lyric exercises these, according to 
Mr. Ransome, a parodic imitation which is in 
itself a form of criticism. But he overlooks 
the deeper significance of all this open plagiary, 
which makes Wilde's poetry a summary of the 
poetic tendencies of his age. Beneath all this 
epiphytic verse we see no mere literary disci- 
pline, but a real inability to derive poetic impulse 
or inspiration from life untouched by art. 

An unemotional temperament, I believe, we 
must surely call Wilde, in spite of his sensuous- 
ness and his sensuality. Possibly the latter was 
the direct result of his frenzied search for emo- 
tion, which we may note, even in these early 
poems, turning him from the delights of the 
pagan world to the no less sensuous mysticism 
of his Catholic verses. However that may be, 
we shall all agree with Mr. Ransome that this 
"youthful" volume of poems is "too immediate 
an attempt to turn life into literature." It has 
suggested to others, as to him, that its author 
has now and again "tried to make life simply 
for the purpose of transcribing it." But did he 
ever quite outlive this characteristic? 

Those who doubt it may point to his "aes- 
thetic" period. Shades of John Ruskin! It 
appears that Wilde was sent to America, not 
primarily to lecture, but to ensure the success 
of " Patience " by giving the Americans a speci- 
men of the genus a3sthete to illustrate- the satire 
of the opera. Like Gautier in the thirties, Wilde 
at this time was already famous for his eccen- 
tricities of dress his velveteen knee-breeches 
and his lace- trimmed shirts. So he came to 
America, and filled thereby his ever-gaping 
pockets. That accomplished, " tired of prophecy 
and ready to take a part in a new play," he went 
to Paris, where he imitated Balzac down to his 
dressing-gown and jewel-set cane. The result 
of this visit was that Elizabethan pastiche, " The 
Duchess of Padua," and "The Sphinx," a "rare 



14

incantation," perhaps, but one which certainly 
contains a deal of Romantic rigmarole. 

Was it Flaubert, Heredia, or Huysmans who 
inspired this curious production, wherein one can 
scarcely see the poem for the words? Mr. Ran- 
some does not tell us. So we must leave " The 
Sphinx" and follow Wilde back to London 
an unintentional expatriate to whom Provi- 
dence had denied the boon of a Gallic nativity. 
Brought home by an empty purse, he resumes 
his lecturing, marries, becomes a book-reviewer, 
and edits "The Woman's World," gaining from 
all this journalistic work a lighter touch and a 
number of good paragraphs for which he will find 
a further use in his later books. He writes a 
few rather mediocre stories, imitates Hans Chris- 
tian Andersen in "The Happy Prince" and "A 
House of Pomegranates," but imitates him with 
pen tempered in the far richer diction of Gautier 
and Flaubert. Decorative prose that is his 
new experiment, just as in "The Sphinx" he 
had anglicized decorative verse. And when, 
several years later, Wilde wrote " The Picture 
of Dorian Gray," he calls it frankly "an essay 
on decorative art," a book which " reacts against 
the brutality of plain realism." 

Certainly "Dorian Gray" is not realistic. 
Yet it is modelled upon a Gallic type, probably 
" A Rebours," and constitutes "the first French 
novel to be written in the English language." 
We can allow this, if the phrase be limited to 
a certain kind of modern novel. Not all of our 
contemporary French fiction, however, is of the 
type of " Dorian Gray." 

But we have outstripped our chronology. 
We must turn from this curious book, disre- 
garding, as our critic does, its pathological sig- 
nificance, and take up Wilde's work in literary 
criticism, which also derived much from his 
journalistic period. Half story, half essay, 
" The Portrait of Mr. W. H." may serve as a 
transition. And, like " Dorian Gray," the story 
has its biographical value ; in none of his work 
can Wilde keep from self -portrayal. In another 
essay he defends Wainewright the murderer, 
perhaps with a prophetic intuition of his own 
destiny; and then, in "The Decay of Lying" 
and "The Critic as Artist," he brings together 
his decadent Socrates and Alcibiades, the bril- 
liant sophist and the languid disciple of these 
essays in dialogue. 

Here, says Mr. Ransome, we find "the domi- 
nant mood of his life"; herein best of all may 
we taste "that elixir of intellectual vitality that 
he royally spilled over his conversation." This 
is probably true; at any rate these essays give 



us his whole aesthetic and literary theory. Criti- 
cism, for Wilde, means "the delicate adven- 
tures of the intellect," precisely the attitude of 
Monsieur Anatole France, whose charming essays 
in dilettanteism had already begun to appear in 
"Le Temps" two years before. The fact might 
well be added to Mr. Ransome's enumeration 
of Wilde's French models. Furthermore, not 
only did Anatole France provide Wilde the critic 
with a theory, but his "Thai's " gave Wilde the 
dramatist the plot of " La Sainte Courtisane." 

For in the drama, as elsewhere, this genius 
was not " unready to work with bouts-rimes" 
He knew the favorite characters of the French 
stage as well as the British, and he used them. 
Wilde was no respecter of dramatis personce. 
Of these characters he made mouth-pieces for 
his epigrams ; once more he finds a use for the 
puns that rose so readily to his Irish lips. Into 
these stage dialogues go all the paradoxes of his 
other works ; and when one notes the frequency 
of these repetitions, one is tempted to doubt the 
vitality of that conversational " elixir." Cer- 
tainly " The Importance of Being Earnest " has 
little of the intellectual element in its laughter. 
Best of the comedies, because of its consistent 
triviality, across the footlights it produces the 
aching cheeks of farce. 

All this makes it hard to place " Salome." 
Mr. Ransome connects the play with the two 
early tragedies ; and reminds us that if Wilde 
was a jester for love of money and popularity, 
he always preferred to think of himself as "a 
person with magnificent dreams." Maeterlinck, 
too, was dreaming in drama just then, and many 
of the qualities of that expression passed by some 
mysterious influence into Wilde's production. 
That fact may even account for its being written 
in French, as the most immediate vehicle of its 
morbid symbolism. In any case, " Salome " 
was not written in that language for Bernhardt, 
but only offered to the divine Sarah when she 
asked Wilde for a play. Three French authors, 
it appears, had a hand in the revision of the 
text, the final touches being given by Pierre 
Louys. 

But before " Salome " was presented, Wilde's 
own life-drama had reached its climax, and he 
was serving a two-year sentence in Reading Gaol. 
Here he came into contact with physical pain, 
rebelled, and then yielded to its teaching, casting 
up accounts with himself in the introspective 
pages of " De Profundis." Not that the book 
had any continuous practical relation to his 
life afterwards. No, it is a pure piece of artistic 
feeling, vivified by the emotional unity that pain

alone can give a nature such as Wilde's. "Re- 
pentance like that in ' De Profundis,' " observes 
Mr. Ransome, " is a guarantee of a moment of 
humility, but not of a life of reform." And 
once out of prison, he soon became a mere straw 
in the current of events, having lost once and for- 
ever "his power of turning life into tapestry." 

It is a different Wilde that we have now, not 
a reformed one. The difference appears in the 
"Ballad of Reading Gaol."' Within the prison 
walls he could still dream, as he did in " De 
Profundis," of what his life to come might be; 
now at last he knew what it was. It was a rude 
awakening, and the violence of the ballad does 
but reflect it. This delicate artist, this dilettante 
of emotion, has come into contact with pain, with 
a reality so harsh as to tear from him the cry 
of Marsyas. And so the decorative mood gives 
way to realism, a realism which is only partially 
obscured by the completion of the ballad in a 
more " artistic " mood. The result is interesting, 
because it shows Wilde's art for once deficient 
in unity. Thoroughly artificial in his conception 
of literature, a real emotion has almost shattered 
his lyre. 

Mr. Ransome, it must be said, does not go 
so far as this. He is quite impressed with the 
" Ballad of Reading Gaol," and pursues a long 
digression on what he calls "kinetic" and "po- 
tential" literature, which those interested in es- 
thetic theory may best peruse in his own words. 
They may also read his "After Thought," with 
its discussion of Wilde's prose, of his love of 
admiration, and his virtuosity. "He leaves 
three things behind him," says Mr. Ransome, 
" his legend, his conversation, and his works. 
. . . Much of his work fails; much of it has 
already faded, but ' Intentions,' ' The Sphinx,' 
'The Ballad of Reading Gaol,' 'Salome,' 'The 
Importance of Being Earnest,' one or two of 
the fairy tales, and ' De Profundis,' are surely 
enough with which to challenge the attention 
of posterity." 

The attention of posterity! Perhaps, if we 
take the word in its most immediate connotation. 
But for all but the greatest art there is no pos- 
terity, unless we consider the handful of scholars 
and writers of doctors' theses who alone concern 
themselves with the secondary works of a bygone 
age. Wilde has his part in literary history as 
a precursor, but to believe that another century 
will occupy itself with him requires strong faith. 
He has no message for which he will be remem- 
bered, unless it be the one essay which is so ex- 
ploited by advancing socialism. He has artistic 
qualities, indeed ; he has beauties of style, but 



no style fades more quickly than one which is 
inspired by a pure love of decoration. 

The man, of course, will continue to have his 
interest for the pathologist, for the student of 
literary types, for the morbidly romantic person. 
" Some day it will be possible to write of him," 
asserts Mr. Ransome, "with the ecstatic acquies- 
cence that Nietzsche calls Amor Fati, as we 
write of Csesar Borgia sinning in purple, 
Cleopatra sinning in gold, and Roberto Greene 
hastening his end by drab iniquity and gray 
repentance." The gods preserve us from all 
such ecstasy, no matter what the color-scheme! 
Various and changeable as moral codes have 
been and may be, the virtue of self-control must 
always remain at least a distinction. 

Possibly this is a narrow attitude. I have 
said that it is altogether too soon to claim impar- 
tiality ; one can only state one's personal view. 
But as a critic of life and an exponent of a new 
" philosophy " of conduct, we have the right to 
adopt a personal standpoint toward Wilde. As 
a representative of the last phase of a decadent 
Romanticism, its cult of sentiment transformed 
to a mere worship of sense and sense-impressions 
in themselves, we have the right to confront 
his theories with his life. As a socialist, an 
individualist, an intellectual dilettante without 
a concept of the social function of art, we have 
every right to judge him. And however a sen- 
timental or " aesthetic " liberal may bring him- 
self to disregard the life of this gifted degener- 
ate, he cannot obscure the fact that Oscar Wilde, 
with his poses and his follies, has done more than 
any other writer to degrade the adjective " artis- 
tic," and to further the growing contempt of the 
workaday world for art.

nary shifting would no doubt take place among 
the objects at the focus of our attention. It is 
needless to specify the public issues that would 
be crowded toward the extreme margin of our 
field of vision ; among those that would continue 
to force themselves upon us insistently and pain- 
fully is that of the conservation of our human 
resources. Are we certain that our human re- 
sources are not going the way of our forests, the 
native fertility of our soils, our mineral wealth, 
exploited in haste and waste ? It is obvious 
enough that our industrial system draws largely 
upon human energy stored up under different 
conditions of life. Our own farms and villages, 
the rural districts of European countries, have 
provided us with an indispensable part of our 
industrial labor supply. How are we using this 
source of our power ? 

We know that among the waste products of 
our industry along with tailings, slag, and 
culm heaps are great numbers of men, women, 
and children with warped bodies and shattered 
nerves, with dulled intelligence and blunted 
morals, victims of the racking strain of the 
machine process. We know that great numbers 
are chronically underfed, wretchedly housed and 
clad. We know that the overstrain and the un- 
derpayment rest especially heavily upon women, 
to whom, we are wont gallantly to assert, is 
entrusted the destiny of the next generation. 
These things we all know, but our knowledge is 
of a vague and abstract character, ill calculated 
to arouse us to action. Fortunately there is 
now a group of valiant men and women who 
have undertaken the gigantic task of making 
concrete our knowledge of the human aspect of 
industrialism. Of this group the writers whose 
books are here under review deserve to rank as 
honored members. 

The point upon which Miss Goldmark lays 
chief emphasis in her work on " Fatigue and 
Efficiency " is the fatigue from which industrial 
workers suffer. Everyone who has lived in a 
factory town has observed that large classes qf 
workers, especially women and girls, appear 
excessively weary, not merely at the end of the 
day, but often at its beginning. Observers of 
optimistic temperament usually assume that this 
is merely an incident to adjustment to the work, 
or a result of the strain of seasonal labor, soon 
to be relaxed by the approach of dull seasons. 
Miss Goldmark places the facts of overwork and 
overstrain in a new light through an analysis of 
laboratory studies in the problem of fatigue. 
The phenomena of fatigue, the physiologists tell 
us, are phenomena of poisoning. Long continued 



exertion produces various toxins that must be re- 
moved by complete rest, on pain of serious dis- 
turbance of all organic functions. A working 
population whose periods of rest are insufficient 
to remove the toxins of fatigue generated in its 
working periods is a population suffering under 
chronic poisoning. The resistance of such a 
population to general infections is lowered in a 
marked degree. Such evidence as we have, 
though fragmentary, indicates pretty clearly 
that the morbidity rate is higher among indus- 
trial workers than among other classes of the 
same age-groups. It also indicates that the 
morbidity rate is especially high among women 
engaged in industry. It is no doubt the deterior- 
ation of the general health of women industrial 
workers that is largely responsible for the fright- 
ful infant mortality of some of our textile towns. 
In Lowell, for example, out of 1000 children 
born, 231 die under one year of age. New York 
City, not over-merciful to its children, destroys 
only 125. 

We cannot return to the simpler and more 
wholesome conditions of an earlier age. Our 
machines will continue to increase their speed; 
labor will be further subdivided, and grow still 
more monotonous. We cannot expel women 
from industry : our society needs the services of 
the millions of women and girls in its stores and 
factories and workshops, and these millions of 
women and girls need their opportunities for 
employment. We can, however, reduce the 
working day to a reasonable length ; we can pro- 
hibit night work and restrict overtime to narrow 
limits. To judge from past experience in the 
reduction of working hours, these reforms would 
not involve even an immediate loss in productive 
power. They would force a readjiistment of 
work, and more careful planning on the part of 
employers. They would eliminate a few em- 
ployers too incompetent to adapt themselves to 
a new situation. In the long run, without doubt, 
their influence would be wholly salutary. 

Miss Goldmark recognizes that fatigue is not 
the only evil afflicting the working class. But 
the evil of fatigue is, in her view, fundamental. 
As long as the worker remains, in effect, a vic- 
tim of chronic poisoning, better wages, greater 
security of employment, and improved housing 
can avail him little. 

As the purpose of the writer is purely prac- 
tical, she does not confine herself narrowly to 
her main theme, but introduces whatever mate- 
rial she conceives may prove useful to the re- 
former. Much of the space of the book is given 
to an analysis of existing labor laws and a criti-

cism of the methods employed in their enforce- 
ment. The book contains, in addition to its 
three hundred pages of text, the substance of 
the briefs submitted to the courts by Mr. Louis 
D. Brandeis and Miss Goldmark in defense of 
the ten-hour laws of Oregon and Illinois and 
the fifty-four-hour law of Ohio. This material 
is excellent; it gives ready access to the best 
expert opinion, both American and foreign, on 
the physical effects of industrial labor. Miss 
Goldmark's book may justly be appraised as the 
most important recent contribution to the litera- 
ture of the labor problem. 

" Making Both Ends Meet " also deals with 
the strain and weariness of women's labor, the 
waste of women's strength and life in the fac- 
tories and workshops of the modern city. Chief 
emphasis, however, is laid upon the question of 
wages. The method employed by Mrs. Clark 
and Miss Wyatt differs radically from that of 
Miss Goldmark. The latter works, by pref- 
erence, with statistics, laboratory tests, expert 
opinion ; the authors of " Making Both Ends 
Meet" describe the life of the workers as it has 
fallen under their direct observation, and narrate 
the histories, more or less typical, of workers 
whose confidence they have gained. The au- 
thors enable us to see exactly what these workers 
earn and how they spend their earnings ; what 
is their home life, if we may thus distort the 
meaning of that phrase; what opportunities 
they have for recreation and enjoyment ; what 
chances offer of substantial improvement in their 
lot. At best the story is one of barely making 
both ends meet ; at worst, it is a story no one 
will read with pleasure. The book gives evi- 
dence of much patient and courageous work on 
the part of the authors and their collaborators. 
Its intensely personal note makes it an excellent 
complement of the work of Miss Goldmark. 

Miss Butler's " Saleswomen in Mercantile 
Stores " is a detailed study of the conditions of 
work and pay in the mercantile establishments 
in Baltimore. The author's work is thorough 
and systematic ; and it is to be hoped that similar 
investigations will be made in other cities. The 
saleswomen of Baltimore work 56.9 hours a 
week (70.7 hours the week before Christmas). 
Half of them earn five dollars a week or less ; not 
one-fifth of them earn above six dollars a week. 
Overwork and underpay, these form the com- 
mon lot of women in "gainful occupations." 

In " The Women of To-morrow," Mr. William 
Hard addresses himself to another aspect of the 
modern industrial situation : the assumption by 
industry of manifold functions formerly exercised 



by the household, and the consequent acquisition 
of leisure by women of the middle class. That 
this problem is a serious one, Mrs. Schreiner 
and Mrs. Gilman have already convinced us. 
Half the women of the middle class do not marry; 
those who do marry have few children, as a rule, 
and consequently find difficulties in occupying 
themselves fully difficulties possibly somewhat 
exaggerated by our sociological writers. Mr. 
Hard sees in present-day educational tendencies 
the promise of a solution of the problem. The 
women of to-morrow will be trained for an inde- 
pendent part in economic life; they will be 
trained in the art of spending ; they will be 
trained for the assumption of civic duties Mr. 
Hard is, however, no dealer in solutions; he is 
an enthusiastic inquirer with an optimistic trend, 
and his book is so attractively written that the 
reader himself is almost constrained to assume 
an attitude of enthusiastic optimism. Who 
knows? Possibly the well-trained women of 
to-morrow will solve the problems of industrial 
labor now so hopelessly bungled by the men of 
to-day. ALVIN S. JOHNSON. 



CARTWRIGHT 



LABRADOR.* 



Toward the close of the eighteenth century 
there appeared a formidable narrative, in three 
volumes, bearing in the manner of the period 
this comprehensive title: "Journal of Transac- 
tions and Events during a Residence of nearly 
Sixteen Years on the Coast of Labrador; con- 
taining Many Interesting Particulars both of the 
Country and its Inhabitants not hitherto Known; 
Illustrated with Proper Charts." The Journal 
of Captain George Cartwright now ranks among 
the rare Americana, and is seldom found even 
in the larger libraries. It has always seemed 
matter for regret that someone had not under- 
taken a reprint of this valuable narrative ; for it 
is such from several points of view. Cartwright 
was a man of untiring energy and wide observa- 
tion. During his long residence on the Labrador 
coast he was almost constantly on the move, 
hunting, trapping, fishing, visiting Indian and 
Eskimo encampments, exploring the country; 
wherever he went he found something new to 
interest him, and whatever he saw he made a 
note of, for his own sake in the first instance, 
and ultimately for ours. What he tells us is 
well worth the telling, and it gains double value

from the simple and graphic frankness of the 
author's style. The Journal in its original form 
is a delightfully entertaining narrative, with only 
two faults its inaccessibility and its inordinate 
length. Thanks to Dr. Townsend, to whom we 
were already indebted for several books on Lab- 
rador, both these faults have now been elimi- 
nated. He has not only given us a reprint of 
Cartwright's Journal, but he has succeeded in 
reducing it to the compass of a single volume 
without destroying any of the charm of the ori- 
ginal. 

In his own Preface and Introduction, Dr. 
Townsend presents an interesting account of 
Cartwright as he appeared to his contemporaries, 
and of his life before and after he engaged in 
the Labrador fur-trade. Southey's picture of 
this Robinson Crusoe of the north, as he ap- 
peared in 1791, is too good to pass by. 

"I was visiting with the Lambs, at Hampstead, in 
Kent, at the house of Hodges, his brother-in-law; we 
had nearly finished dinner when he came in. He de- 
sired the servant to cut him a plate of beef from the 
sideboard. I thought the footman meant to insult him: 
the plate was piled to a height which no ploughboy after 
a hard day's fasting could have levelled ; but the moment 
he took up his knife and fork and arranged the plate, I 
saw this was no common man. A second and third sup- 
ply soon vanished. Mr. and Mrs. Lamb, who had never 
before seen him, glanced at each other; but Tom and I, 
with schoolboys' privilege, kept our eyes riveted upon 
him with what Doctor Butt would have called the gaze 
of admiration. ' I see you have been looking at me,' 
(said he, when he had done). 'I have a very great 
appetite. I once fell in with a stranger in the shooting 
season, and we dined together at an inn. There was a 
leg of mutton, v/hich he did not touch. I never make 
more than two cuts off a leg of mutton; the first takes 
all one side, the second all the other; and when I had 
done this, I laid the bone across my knife for the mar- 
row. The stranger could refrain no longer. ' By God, 
sir,' said he, ' I never saw a man eat like you!'" 

It is difficult to give an adequate idea of the 
range of subjects that engaged Cartwright's rest- 
less curiosity and found a place in his Journal. 
Nothing was too trivial to escape his notice. He 
gives many pages to a minute and remarkably 
accurate account of the beaver; and elsewhere 
he gravely describes the adventure of the ship's 
goat with a bucket of rum. She got through 
nearly a gallon of that insidious beverage, it ap- 
pears, "and has continued ever since in so com- 
plete a state of intoxication as to be unable to 
get upon her legs." His description of a mid- 
winter camp will appeal to some of us who have 
tried that sort of thing. 

"At midnight the frost increased; the wind blew the 
fire about, and made it smoke most intolerably. The 
fuel was not of a good kind for burning, and the trees in 
the wood being small and rather thinly scattered, those 
parts of us which were not immediately next to the fire 



were ready to freeze; we were therefore obliged to turn 
ourselves continually; during which time I often wished 
to be lashed to a spit, and turned like a roasting goose, 
without the trouble of doing it myself." 

One gets some idea of the profits of the 
fur-trade in its palmy days from Cartwright's 
narrative. 

" Shuglawina (an Eskimo) made me a present of a 
very fine silver fox skin; but he insisted on having the 
same price for the brush of it as I had just paid for an 
entire skin. However, as he only demanded a small 
ivory comb, which cost me no more than twopence half- 
penny, and the skin was worth four guineas, I made no 
scruple in completing the purchase." 

After what Southey tells us, it is not sur- 
prising to find frequent mention of meals in the 
Journal, and some of them were odd enough. 
Traders wintering on the Labrador could not 
afford to be squeamish. " I had a loin of white 
bear roasted for dinner," he says in one place, 
" which proved very good ; although, to say the 
truth, it was much like beef basted with seal 
oil ; however, for want of the beef without the 
oil, I ate near two pounds of it." On another 
occasion he and his men were reduced to a 
fore-quarter of wolf, which proved so hard, 
dry, tough, and rank, that at first he could not 
swallow it. A day or two later, he mentions 
that he had finished the wolf, and adds, with an 
air of sly triumph, that he has at last got the 
better of his squeamish stomach. But as a 
trencherman he has to admit that he is not in 
the same class with the average Eskimo. He 
entertained a party of them at his camp. " Nine 
salmon were boiled for them, and, although the 
fish were fifteen pounds weight each, on an 
average, they ate the whole at a meal. I can eat 
pretty well myself ; but my performances in that 
way are not worth recording in the history of men 
of such superior talents." 

In addition to a very complete account of the 
Eskimo, and the Indians of Labrador, Cart- 
wright gives from personal knowledge a de- 
scription of the since extinct Beothuk tribe of 
Newfoundland. So little is known of this unfor- 
tunate race that this record, based on personal 
observation, is exceedingly valuable. He de- 
scribes them as " the most forlorn of any of the 
human species which have yet come to my knowl- 
edge, the Indians of Terra del Fuego excepted." 

Of his many adventures by land and sea, 
none is perhaps more exciting than a raid which 
he suffered in August, 1778, at the hands of a 
Boston privateer, commanded by one John 
Grimes. Grimes swooped down on the Labra- 
dor settlement, took possession of Cartwright's 
vessels, loaded them with his furs and stores, 
and sailed away to the south. " May the devil

go with them!" feelingly exclaims poor Cart- 
wright. 

On his last voyage home, Cartwright had as 
cabin-mate no less a personage than Benedict 
Arnold, of whom he gives no very flattering ac- 
count. The voyage was a long one, and before 
they reached England passengers and crew were 
on short allowance. Water was particularly 
scarce, and the passengers were only allowed a 
pint a day. When the ship came into port, 
Cartwright examined the lockers in his cabin 
and found a number of bottles of wine missing. 
"I was informed by the mate," he says, "that 
at such times as I was upon deck, General 
Arnold, through the medium of his servant, had 
stolen most of the wine, which belonged to us 
both, and had sold it to the sailors for water, 
which he kept for his own use."

THE NEW HISTORY.* 

Every now and then the omniscient reviewer 
pronounces some historical work to be "definitive." 
I confess to an entire lack of interest in all such 
works, if they really are definitive. Why study 
a subject about which nothing more can be learned? 
It is a desolating thought that a period once impor- 
tant, such as the Reformation, or a great movement 
as fascinating as it is elusive, like the French Revo- 
lution, has been put on the shelf finally: quite fin- 
ished and done with, and done for; nothing more 
to be said about it, henceforth useless except to be 
conned by rote. Who cares to open a book that is 
without defect or amiable weakness? The impec- 
cable thing paralyzes the will and makes pedants of 
us all. 

Fortunately, the definitive book in history is 
never definitive for more than a short while. The 
appearance of many definitive works, the flourishing 
of "standard" histories, is most usually an indica- 
tion, not that history is exhausted, but that a certain 
method of treating it is about played out. Sooner 
or later some disturbing genius takes a new point of 
view, some heretic comes along with a novel method 
of treatment, and everything has to be done over 
again. The "new history " is announced before the 
old has become fairly complacent. 

"The present," says Professor Robinson in his 
volume entitled "The New History," "has hitherto 
been the willing victim of the past ; the time has now 
come when it should turn on the past and exploit it 
in the interest of advance." In one sense it might 
be maintained that the present has never been the 
victim of the past, but that its instinct has always

Historical Outlook. By James Harvey Robinson, Professor 
of History in Columbia University. New York : The Mac- 
millan Co. 



been to exploit the past for its own purposes. In 
some periods the interest of the present has seemed 
to lie in sustaining existing social arrangements, in 
justifying certain prevailing theories of life; and in 
such periods history has been a conservative force. 
At other times the interest of the present has seemed 
to lie in transforming existing institutions, in de- 
stroying certain prevailing conceptions; and then 
men have turned to the past and have found in it 
arguments suited to revolution. History, when it 
has not been merely edifying, has usually served 
primarily either as a justification or as a criticism 
of the existing regime. 

Thus Saint Augustine exploited the past to dis- 
credit Paganism and to propagate Christian doctrine ; 
and his conception of history, after Christianity 
almost destroyed Paganism, was for many centuries 
a powerful conservative force, an instrument for 
maintaining the supremacy of the Church. But the 
Protestants appealed to history to justify their revolt 
from that same Church, quite definitely and con- 
sciously they " exploited the past in the interest of 
advance." Quite as definitely, though perhaps less 
consciously, the erudite scholars of the seventeenth 
and eighteenth centuries contributed an intellectual 
prop for the absolutist system of that age. But 
when the main currents of social life in France set 
in the direction of reform the patient Benedictine 
engaged in collecting documents for the history of his 
order, or the learned layman, a Fre'ret for example, 
with his twenty volumes of impartial and disinter- 
ested scholarship, suffered eclipse. It was about 
the middle of the eighteenth century that the " Phi- 
losophers" announced a "new history," a history 
which was to tell the average man, not what actually 
happened, but what he ought to think about what 
had happened, and especially about what might 
happen; and this new history did indeed exploit 
the past most effectively in the interest of advance, 
or what was supposed to be advance. 

But what of the nineteenth century, with its de- 
tachment and scientific method ? Have we not been 
assured that the writing of history has at last been 
put on a sound and permanent foundation ? Un- 
doubtedly we have, but that is an old story. Every 
generation is disposed to think "we are the people 
and wisdom will die with us." Still one may hope 
that historical wisdom will survive Leopold von 
Ranke, and even Mr. Round. The future student 
of the intellectual life of our day will doubtless see 
shat the historical writing of the nineteenth century, 
ike the historical writing of other times, has been 
shaped by the pressure of social needs; will point 
out how it has served a certain social purpose; will 
perhaps admit, from his superior vantage, that much 
rood work was done in spite of inadequate knowl- 
dge and an imperfect criticism. Perhaps it will then

disciples, was one of the forms assumed by the intel-

tellectual life of the century what the Historic Rights 
party was in political life, a most effective bulwark 
against those insurgent principles that were regarded 
as having played havoc with Europe for a generation. 
Convinced by sharp experience that conscious at- 
tempts at radical social reconstruction were danger- 
ous, the nineteenth century wished to exploit the past 
to disprove the doctrine of natural rights and to con- 
demn the methods of the French Revolution. And 
so, working in such an atmosphere, historians nat- 
urally enough became interested in historic rights 
rather than in natural rights ; preoccupied with what 
happened, they were studiously non-commital about 
what ought to have happened; disposed to make 
much of changes that came very slowly and little of 
changes that came suddenly; inclined to belittle con- 
scious purpose as an influence in shaping institutions ; 
well content if it turned out that some great affair 
could be traced to an obscure origin, as, for exam- 
ple, the expense involved in equipping a cavalry 
service. And after much patient investigation along 
the lines of these initial preconceptions, it was discov- 
ered that in fact there were no natural rights ; that 
what happened was nearly if not quite the thing that 
had to happen, so that it was useless to inquire what 
ought to have happened ; that change in institutions 
and ideas was, to be sure, the fundamental thing in 
history; but that change was most fruitful if it came 
slowly without anyone's wishing for it, and least 
fruitful if it came quite suddenly as the result of 
everybody's wishing for it very much, and working 
to bring it about. For purposes of illustration, the 
history of England was found, rather providentially, 
to be wonderfully well adapted. And so, by a most 
happy chance, history itself, scientifically conceived 
and impartially studied, proved that the French 
Revolution was undoubtedly a necessary mistake, 
an historical event which had done a certain amount 
of good surely, but which, by virtue of having de- 
parted from the most approved precedents, had done 
it in a very bad way. 

But the shadow which the Reign of Terror cast 
over Europe for a century is passing, while at the 
same time it is perfectly certain that neither the 
formulas of the Manchester school, nor the resound- 
ing phrases of Liberalism, nor reliance upon the 
Manifest Destiny of Historic Rights, is ushering in 
any millenium. At present there are signs of a re- 
turn to earlier ideas, a disposition, in certain quar- 
ters, to rehabilitate the "rags and tags and paltry 
blurred shreds of paper about the rights of man." 
The resplendent vision of Perfectibility, although it 
has doubtless taken on some neutral litmus paper 
tints, has never been quite lost; transformed into the 
idea of Progress the belief that society can by its 
own efforts indefinitely increase the happiness and 
welfare of all men it is perhaps the one really vital 
faith of our day. It is not impossible, therefore, that 
the great task of the present century will centre in 
a second attempt to bring to fruition those splendid 
ideals of social justice which the generous minds of 
the eighteenth century conceived, and which the men 



of the Revolution, with the courage of their emotions, 
embodied in " glittering generalities " for the edifica- 
tion of mankind. As the problem of " social better- 
ment" becomes more insistent, discontent with the ex- 
isting regime gathers force. It is not unreasonable to 
suppose that in the next half century intellectual inter- 
ests will be somewhat withdrawn from the past and 
concentrated somewhat more in the future, less con- 
cerned about what actually happened and rather more 
concerned about what ought to happen. That this 
change of emphasis will profoundly affect the study 
and writing of history, is a prediction which may be 
safely ventured. 

The purpose of Professor Robinson's little volume 
(which is only a collection of essays and addresses 
prepared for different occasions during the last ten 
years, and which, for that reason, lacks something of 
the definiteness, consistency, and structural coordi- 
nation which the title might lead one to expect) is to 
venture just that prediction, to suggest that the time 
is ripe for historians to ask themselves whether the 
aims and methods by which so much has been achieved 
in the last sixty years are precisely those which will 
serve best for the future. Professor Robinson is con- 
vinced that they are not ; and, without professing to 
formulate any definite programme, he wishes to em- 
phasize the fact " that history should not be regarded 
as a stationary subject which can only progress by 
refining its methods and accumulating, criticizing, 
and assimilating new material, but that it is bound 
to alter its ideals and aims with the general progress 
of society and of the social sciences, and that it should 
ultimately play an infinitely more important role in 
our intellectual life than it has hitherto done." Not 
unnaturally, therefore, one characteristic note of the 
book is discontent; and in this it voices the feeling 
of many historical students, especially of the younger 
generation. What is the use, they are asking them- 
selves, of so many learned volumes which nobody 
reads? What is the use of so much erudition that 
contributes so little to "the instant need of things"? 
In reading these essays one often wonders if Profes- 
sor Robinson does not regret that Fate made him an 
historian at all, and not a real scientist, an anthro- 
pologist perhaps, or comparative psychologist. In the 
end, however, one is convinced that such is not the 
case ; for if he sees the "plight in which history finds 
itself " just now, he is confident that there is a bril- 
liant future in store for it ; and this note of confidence 
in the future of history is only less marked than the 
note of dissatisfaction with its present condition. 

In both respects Professor Robinson's attitude 
inevitably recalls the point of view of the eighteenth 
century Philosophe. "All the weighty substance 
of our historians," said Grimm in 1755, "consists in 
a tedious and pedantic discussion of facts which are 
ordinarily as indifferent as they are uncertain." 
Professor Robinson, in like manner, employs his dry 
humor at the expense of a certain type of historian 
solemnly engaged in determining "whether Charles 
the Fat was in Ingelheim or Lustnau on July 1, 887," 
or in pointing out "the spot where Nehemiah

Abbot's ox met an untimely and suspicious end by 
choking on a turnip." With the dull chronicle, how- 
ever adequately "documented," Professor Robinson 
is dissatisfied, not because it is dull, but because it 
so often does not help us in the least to understand 
the present, and so does not help us to deal with its 
problems intelligently. This was also the point of 
view of the eighteenth century reformer. "Other 
historians," Diderot told Voltaire, "relate facts to 
inform us of facts. You relate them in order to 
excite in us an intense hatred of lying, ignorance, 
hypocrisy, superstition, fanaticism, tyranny ; and this 
anger remains, even after the memory of the facts 
has passed away." Professor Robinson is as far as 
possible from wishing the historian to relate facts 
in order to excite hatred and anger. The point of 
resemblance is that he, like Grimm and Diderot, 
wishes to exploit the past in the interest of advance. 
Now, in the eighteenth century the histories which 
exploited the past in the interest of advance were 
precisely those which aroused discontent with the 
existing regime. It is perhaps a fair question 
whether histories written in the twentieth century, 
if they are consciously to exploit the past in the 
interest of advance, will do it in the same way, 
by arousing discontent with the existing regime. 

Yes, Professor Robinson would reply; provided 
it arouses an intelligent discontent, that is precisely 
the best thing history can possibly do. The business 
of history is to arouse an intelligent discontent, to 
foster a fruitful radicalism; but it should do this, 
not by becoming less scientific than it is now, but 
by becoming more scientific. And this, again, is 
the attitude of the eighteenth century philosophers. 
Diderot and Grimm and their fellows were con- 
vinced that history could be properly written only 
"by Philosophers," by men, that is, who were 
thoroughly familiar with the scientific knowledge 
of the day. Now, the most definite contention in 
Professor Robinson's book, the one which he would 
doubtless consider most important, is precisely that 
historians have hitherto failed to make use of the 
results of what he calls the newer sciences of man- 
kind, "Anthropology, in a comprehensive sense, 
Prehistoric Archaeology, Social and Animal Psy- 
chology, and the Comparative Study of Religions." 
History, professing to deal with man in the past, 
has concerned itself much with the past but very 
little with man. In the future, "if history is to 
reach its highest development, it must confess that 
it is based on sister sciences, that it can progress 
only with them, must lean largely on them for 
support, and in return should repay its debt by the 
contributions it makes to our understanding of our 
species." The most vital concern of our day is the 
progress of the race through conscious effort. Such 
progress will be permanent and real only if based 
upon a genuine scientific knowledge of man; and 
only by assimilating thoroughly this scientific knowl- 
edge of man can the historian point out to us how 
real progress has been made in the past and so help 
us to proceed aright in the future. It is in this way 



that history will arouse an intelligent discontent and 
foster a fruitful radicalism. 

I have insisted, perhaps unduly, upon the analogy 
between Professor Robinson's point of view and that 
of the eighteenth century reformers, because it seems 
to me that his conception of history raises a funda- 
mental difficulty, a difficulty which also confronted 
them. This difficulty is in respect to the idea of 
progress. What, after all, is progress ? What is the 
test, the standard of value, which is to determine the 
direction of conscious effort towards social recon- 
struction? Professor Robinson's only reply to this 
question is that " no one who realizes the relative 
barbarism of our whole civilization . . . will have 
the patience to formulate any definition of progress 
when the most bewildering opportunities for social 
betterment summon us on every side." This is very 
well if it is only a matter of doing what our hands 
find to do: one may venture to feed the starving 
before formulating a definition of progress. But if 
one wishes to remove the causes of poverty, a defi- 
nition of progress might prove most useful. And 
certainly if the historian is to renounce his present 
aims and methods, and to set himself the task of 
" exploiting the past in the interest of advance," he 
needs a far more definite notion of what advance is 
than can be found in the statement that "the most 
bewildering opportunities for betterment summon us 
on every side "; he needs, in fact, a genuinely scien- 
tific definition of progress. 

It need hardly be said that present-day ideas of 
progress are most intangible. A profound faith in 
progress, we have ; a world of light talk about it, 
that we have also; but the truth is we never know 
what form progress will take until after the event. 
Opposing principles are reconciled by falling into 
chronological sequence, and socialism, for example, 
acquires virtue by the mere passing of liberalism 
into the limbo of yesterday. And this would seem 
to be the necessary result of a philosophy which 
identifies man and nature, thus reducing all values 
to the relative test. The price of not having dogmatic 
creeds is that the content of our faith is successively 
unfolded, as it were, only in the daily practice of it. 
In the eighteenth century the conclusions drawn from 
the premises of Locke left the reformers facing a 
similar difficulty: man is an irresponsible product 
of uniform natural law, said the materialist ; in that 
case, asked the reformer, is not society in all its forms 
necessary too ; this Old Regime, which we have con- 
demned, is it not a very "state of nature " after all? 
The dilemma had been succinctly stated by Pascal 
long before. "Custom," he said, "is a second nature 
which destroys the first. But what is this nature? 
I fear that nature itself is only a first custom." No 
French Revolution could issue from a dilemma which 
brought everything to a stand. It was Rousseau who 
cut the Gordian knot by giving a new form to the 
old dualism of man and nature : " Man is naturally 
good, it is society which corrupts him." The modern 
social reformer is confronted by much the same di- 
lemma; and if conscious effort towards social regen- 



22 



THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



eration is to issue in anything more than temporary 
expedients, the distinction between what is natural 
and permanent in human society and what is artificial 
and temporary must be drawn again in some manner 
or other. But to be in any way effective, the distinc- 
tion must be based upon genuine scientific knowledge 
as well as upon an emotional faith. Perhaps it is 
the task of religion to furnish the latter ; it certainly 
rests with science to furnish the former. Science, 
rather than history, must discover, as Kant said, "the 
constant elements in man's nature, in order to under- 
stand what sort of perfection it is that suits him, alike 
in a state of rude simplicity, in a state of wise simpli- 
city, and in a state which transcends both of these." 
It may be that the "newer sciences of mankind" 
can achieve this. Who shall say ? But until they do, 
it is infinitely true, as Professor Robinson himself 
says, that "one may find solace and intellectual re- 
pose in surrendering all attempts to define history, 
and in conceding that it is the business of the his- 
torian to find out anything about mankind in the 
past which he believes to be interesting or important 
and about which there are sources of information." 
This is a franchise which surely includes us all. 
Meanwhile, by all means let the historian learn all 
he possibly can about the newer sciences of mankind, 
and about the older sciences too, and about philoso- 
phy, about literature, about art, about everything 
that is under the sun : all this knowledge will serve, 
"if judiciously practised, greatly to strengthen and 
deepen the whole range of historical study and 
render its results far more valuable than they have 
hitherto been." CAKL BECKER. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



It is a most attractive personality that 



Hale's volume entitled "Woodrow 
Wilson: The Story of His Life" (Doubleday). 
Whatever may be the outcome of the present presi- 
dential campaign, no one who reads this sketch can 
doubt that our political life has already received a 
much-needed impetus upward by Dr. Wilson's en- 
trance from the seclusion of academic labor into the 
strenuous activities of politics. Dr. Wilson comes 
naturally by his seriousness of purpose, his strength 
of conviction, and his devotion to the cause of edu- 
cation and good government. He is descended from 
an ancestry that has always stood for what is sturdy 
and honorable in American history. The Wilsons 
were Scotch-Irish and the Woodrows (the mother's 
family) were Scotch. One fancies there must have 
been village dominies in the line of the mother's 
descent, and that one of them was reincarnated in the 
friendly, sane, and vigorous president of Princeton, 
who fought so faithfully for sincerity in academic 
life and work and for democracy in the university. 
Most interesting is the story of this batttle of a 
president of one of our greatest universities to 



restore the preeminence of intellectual concerns over 
the shallow and abnormal social interests and the 
baneful athletic craze, which together called forth 
the remark of a cynical observer that Princeton was 
the finest country club in America. Dr. Wilson was 
not content to alter radically the system of election 
of studies, so as to secure better coordination in the 
studies of each student; but he also introduced the 
system of preceptors, in order that young and imma- 
ture minds might have the steady guidance and 
inspiration of trained intelligence in the pursuit of 
their university careers. He went yet a step further, 
and proposed to cut through the artificial stratifica- 
tion of university society, to house all students in 
dormitories and to have men from all college classes 
in the same buildings, and with them young profes- 
sors. It was just when this plan for making uni- 
versity life democratic, and his allied plan for the 
graduate school to be erected on the same campus 
with the college, had received a serious setback, and 
seemed doomed to temporary defeat, that Dr. Wilson 
was summoned into public life. No one who had 
observed his career at Princeton could fail to foresee 
that he would be unswerving in his adherence to 
democracy and honesty in politics ; yet the bosses who 
helped to seat him in the governor's chair seem to 
have estimated the sincerity of his campaign declar- 
ations at the same rate as their own. When they 
learned too late that he meant to keep every promise 
he had made, there was bitter denunciation. He 
had proved recalcitrant and ungrateful. In the pic- 
turesque language of the campaign, Dr. Wilson had 
warned all concerned that it was plain that Provi- 
dence had not intended him to be ornamental and 
that he would be a very busy governor. The record 
of what he accomplished for the people of New 
Jersey against the combined rings of both the Dem- 
ocrats and the Republicans is as thrilling as a story 
of knight-errantry. It is a record that harmonizes 
with the rare quality of Dr. Wilson's stump oratory 
clear, vivid, picturesque, and yet always flavored 
with the dignity that we associate with scholars- 
whose culture has not killed their humanity. 



The story of J . n an allegory or fantasy clothed in 
a heavenly simple and beautiful language that 

pilgrimage. occasionally reminds one of "The 
Pilgrim's Progress," Mr. Arthur C. Benson relates, 
in " The Child of the Dawn " (Putnam) , the supposed 
experiences of a soul privileged to visit heaven and 
to see God in the timeless interval between two suc- 
cessive reincarnations. In an interesting preface 
the author says: "The fact that underlies the book 
is this : that in the course of a very sad and strange 
experience an illness which lasted for some two 
years, involving me in a dark cloud of dejection 
I came to believe practically, instead of merely theo- 
retically, in the personal immortality of the human 
soul. I was conscious, during the whole time, that 
though the physical machinery of the nerves was out 
of gear, the soul and the mind remained, not only

intact, but practically unaffected by the disease, im- 
prisoned, like a bird in a cage, but perfectly free in 
themselves, and uninjured by the bodily weakness 
which enveloped them." Nor was that all. He was 
led to see that his hitherto accepted standards of value 
were more or less false, and "that what really mat- 
tered to the soul was the relation in which it stood 
to other souls ; that affection was the native air 
of the spirit; and that anything which distracted 
the heart from the duty of love was a kind of bodily 
delusion, and simply hindered the spirit in its pil- 
grimage." The picture presented in the succeeding 
pages of the joys and sorrows of discarnate spirits 
is admirably drawn, enriched with many a stroke of 
wit and wisdom, of tenderness and humor, of insight 
and sympathy. The prospect of an indefinite series 
of earthly lives for each soul, as conceived by the 
author, is of course not new or startling, but so for- 
bidding to most of us that we prefer to dream our 
own dreams about the tremendous possibilities of the 
future. What the book teaches most impressively 
and acceptably is the supreme importance of love, 
compared with which nothing else matters. To show 
that the book is not unworthy of mention in the same 
breath with Bunyan's masterpiece, let us quote, as 
an example of its style, a paragraph from its closing 
pages. "Then I took Cynthia's hand and laid it in 
the hand of Lucius ; and I left them there upon the 
peak, and turned no more. And no more woeful 
spirit was in the land of heaven that day than mine 
as I stumbled wearily down the slope, and found the 
valley. And then, for I did not know the way to de- 
scend, I commended myself to God; and he took me." 



A history ^ n 1892, Professor Petrus Johannes 

of the people Blok of the University of Leyden 
of Holland. published the first two volumes of a 
" History of the People of the Netherlands," and in 
1900 these volumes were translated into English by 
Miss Ruth Putnam. As subsequent instalments ap- 
peared in Holland, the translation has been continued; 
until now the fifth and concluding volume, translated 
(as was the fourth) by Mr. Oscar Bierstadt, is pre- 
sented to the public. At the outset the author asserted 
that he desired to present not so much the evolution 
of Holland as a State, but rather the life of the peo- 
ple in " civilization, commerce, industry, agriculture, 
navigation, law, and economic development," and he 
avowedly modelled his work on that of the English 
historian, John Richard Green. In the execution of 
his plan, however, he failed, in the earlier volumes, in 
the attempt to interweave political events and popu- 
lar reaction to those events ; and in this last volume, 
covering the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, he 
has largely altered his method. Political events and 
institutional change are here segregated in separate 
chapters, as are intellectual, industrial, and cultural 
topics, the result being a distinct improvement in 
clarity. The work now completed is an important 
contribution to historical knowledge, at least for En- 
glish readers, since it presents a continuous narrative 



of Dutch history not elsewhere duplicated, while 
the present volume offers a clear resume of political 
conditions in Holland since 1850, by a careful and 
scholarly observer. The most interesting personality 
of this period is Thorbecke, professor at the Univer- 
sity of Leyden, leader of the liberal movement of 
1848, and during three terms chief minister of the 
state. Under his guidance, ministerial responsibility 
and direct election of the popular branch of the 
legislature were secured, and without the strain of a 
revolution, such as swept over Europe in 1848. For 
over a quarter of a century he exercised a tremen- 
dous influence. Mr. Blok tells us that "Thorbecke 
created the forms in which the government was to 
move for a long time ; his strong hand had pointed 
out the way to progress in constitutional development, 
in material prosperity, and intellectual emancipation. 
His name is bound to the history of this important 
period ; his statue on the Thorbecke square in Am- 
sterdam is the memorial of a remarkable phase of 
Holland's national history." A few good maps and 
a wholly inadequate index conclude the volume.

and warnings eree " of London, the short and timely 
of a journalist. ar ti c l es now collected by Mr. Arnold 
White under the title, "The Views of 'Vanoc'" 
(Dutton), furnish considerable matter of interest to 
the desultory reader,- and not a few pages fraught 
with advice or warning of an attention-compelling 
nature to any reader. The reason of the pseu- 
donym, "Vanoc," is explained, or an explanation is 
attempted, in a dedicatory note to the Editor of 
"The Referee." The half- hundred short chapters 
of the book are grouped in nine sections, and have 
to do chiefly with political and social questions. 
Already familiar to Mr. White's readers are his 
views on the necessity of an invincible navy for 
England, and he fails not to sound the alarmist note 
in his book, in an article picturing the supposed 
eagerness of Germany to make a banquet on the 
British Empire. "Russia has Siberia," the author 
points out; "France, a rich soil and a stationary or 
dwindling population; America, ample room to ex- 
pand ; Japan, the whole Far East ; Britain, her own 
Empire. Germany, the greatest military Power, 
has no place under her own flag outside her borders 
where Germans can live and thrive. . . . Germany 
wants that which England possesses." But does 
not all the world know by this time, what "The 
Great Illusion" has so lately been reiterating and 
redemonstrating, that trade and migration do not 
necessarily or exclusively follow the flag? Is not the 
Teutonic portion of New York one of the largest 
German cities in the world, and are there not countless 
acres of new land open to and clamoring for German 
or any other immigrants in the great Northwest of 
America? Here, to change the subject, is a suggestive 
passage from the section devoted to eugenics : " The 
work of the world is mainly done by the gouty; to 
speak by the card, by the irritable, sanguine, nervy,

book is already in its second edition, or impression, 
which speaks well for its readable qualities. 

Masterpieces of As with everything that the late 
art illustrated John La Farge wrote, his comments 
and described. upon u One Hundred Masterpieces 
of Painting" (Doubleday, Page & Co.), originally 
published in " McClure's Magazine," and now put 
together in book form, bear the impress of a 
thoughtful and well-stored mind. The pictures 
one hundred and six in all selected for repro- 
duction have been chosen to exemplify the point of 
view that art is " the mirror of life," and they are 
arranged accordingly, in subject groups. This 
classification, though an arbitrary one, serves well 
enough, especially as care has been exercised to 
include only works that have enduring charm and 
are free from what the author stigmatizes as " the 
bad taste of fashion." His descriptions of the 
paintings, though engagingly written, sometimes, it 
must be said, seem to start nowhere and to lead 
nowhither. In a measure this impression is attrib- 
utable to the way in which, while advancing in an 
apparently leisurely manner, he touches lightly upon 
this thing and that, and passes on to another before 
the reader quite realizes that the transmigration 
has taken place ; but in larger part it is due to the 
avoidance of technical explanation. This omission, 
however, necessarily precludes an adequate expo- 
sition of the really vital qualities in the works 
described. Herein lies the futility of so-called 
" popular " writing about works of art. The nature 
of art forbids that the essential qualities can be 
apprehended without some understanding of the 
laws of aesthetic relationship. Still, the other and 
more usually considered qualities are not unimport- 
ant, and it is instructive to note how they impress 
an artist of such distinction and a man of such 
broad culture as John La Farge. The volume is 
illustrated with excellent half-tone reproductions of 
the famous paintings that he has taken as his text. 
The range is a wide one, extending from Botticelli 
and Memling to Puvis de Chavannes, and even in- 
cluding one picture by an early Japanese master. 

The cheerful l n a volume bearing the title " Recol-

H. Jones Thaddeus tells how he painted the portraits 
of Pope Leo XIII. and his successor Pius X.; how 
he dined with Robert Browning, who looked "like 
a portly shopkeeper" and "whose whole attention 
was centered on the good things before him"; how 
he found it possible to paint Gladstone in peace 
only by agreeing with everything that the irascible 
statesman happened to say; and how he played the 
part of actor or spectator in a hundred other incidents 
which were quite as amusing, even though the par- 



ticipants were less celebrated. Now and then he is 
too much of an artist to be followed patiently by the 
lay reader. Now and then, also, he is perhaps a little 
too much of a Bohemian to please the strait-laced 
and the orthodox; but he is so hearty and genuine 
through it all that it is not difficult to overlook an 
occasional instance of unnecessary frankness or indis- 
creet levity. In his anxiety to make his book attract- 
ive he drags in by the heels a good many anecdotes 
which have not the remotest connection either with 
himself or with his art, certainly one of the most 
noticeable of "the many defects of this my maiden 
effort to wield that which is mightier than the sword." 
The first few chapters are filled with delightful ac- 
counts of youthful pranks in the art schools of Cork, 
London, and Paris. Mr. Thaddeus has been an invet- 
erate traveller, and his impressions of Algiers, Cey- 
lon, and Australia are something more than witty. 
Like some other Britons of even greater celebrity, he 
has little use for America, although a number of 
Americans have sat for him, and contributed gener- 
ously toward his princely income. Of the seventeen 
illustrations scattered through his book, the most 
interesting is a reproduction of a photograph which 
represents him painting a portrait of Pius X. This 
photograph, he says, he secured " partly from a his- 
torical point of view, and partly to disarm calumny, 
to which I had been exposed while painting his 
predecessor." 

A convenient yet comprehensive his- 
tory of French literature in English 
has long been a desideratum. We 
have, to be sure, manuals like Professor Dowden's 
and Mr. Saintsbury's, as well as the somewhat anti- 
quated longer work of Van Laun, but still no one- 
volume history to place beside the admirable French 
production of M. Lanson. So Professor C. H. C. 
Wright of Harvard has undertaken to give us "A 
History of French Literature," and his well-printed 
octavo of 964 pages has just been issued by the 
Clarendon Press. It is a conscientious piece of 
work, this account of the literary development of 
France; indeed, it yields to none of its American 
or English predecessors in soundness of scholarship 
or in range of information. The index, for exam- 
ple, contains over two thousand names a signifi- 
cant number when it is considered that only in his 
final chapter does the author show that inclination 
to enumerate minor writers which is so frequent a 
characteristic of manuals of literature. Professor 
Wright, be it said, devotes his attention mainly to 
the great movements and the great names. Admir- 
able in this respect, the book commends itself to the 
college student and the general reader by its pro- 
portion, its judgment, and its recognition of the lat- 
est discoveries and theories of scholarship. The 
advanced student and the teacher will be grateful 
to the author for his bibliographies and bibliogra- 
phical hints a closely-printed section of 54 pages. 
And both graduate and undergraduate will recog- 
nize in this volume, as in practically all the so-called

as the narrative is, it possesses neither grace of

more manner than matter. So abundant is the 
literary drapery clothing the body of facts that 
one can hardly discern the merest outlines of the 
body. In the matter of proper names alone the 
heroine of the adventure, the narrator herself, is 
"Janey," or "dear old girl," as her companion 
styles her; the travelling companion is for literary 
purposes "the Padre," but in plain English, as one 
makes out at last, the husband of the woman with 
whom he is on so intimate terms and whom he 
addresses so familiarly; the author's birthplace is 
"X," and she apparently, near the end of the book, 
almost falls a victim to "cholecystitis," which to most 
readers will be about the vaguest thing in the whole 
narrative. As a specimen of the author's buoyant 
style, here is what she says of Alberta : " Alberta has 
no past to speak of, but has a future beyond com- 
parison. Tut! I bite my thumb at the past. A 
past may be as great a detriment to a country 
as to a woman." The writer of " Open Trails " is 
already known through her previous book entitled 
"Janey Canuck in the West," and most of her 
readers will hope for still further books in the same 
jaunty and spontaneous manner. 



Kant and 
Spencer 
critically 
expounded. 



Students of the late Professor Borden 
Parker Bowne will welcome the post- 
humous work from his pen entitled 
"Kant and Spencer: A Critical Exposition" (Hough- 
ton Mifflin Co.) which has been edited from the au- 
thor's rough notes by a number of friends who were 
sufficiently familiar with his thought to supply what 



seemed the necessary corrections. The book deals 
with Kant and Spencer from the standpoint of Mr. 
Bowne's own philosophical interpretation of the uni- 
verse, which was a spiritual and personal one. It 
is therefore quite natural that Kant, the philosopher 
who criticised the intellect as a revealer of religious 
truth only to supplant it by the practical reason, and 
who therefore placed the religious interpretation of 
the universe on a stronger basis than ever before, 
comes in for sympathetic treatment.. Kant, however, 
was not final, and Mr. Bowne criticises incisively his 
doctrine of the understanding and of time and space. 
He recognizes, however, Kant's permanent contribu- 
tions to thought, and points out how pragmatism has 
its original source in Kant's doctrine of the activity 
of the mind and the need for an interpretation of 
the universe which shall satisfy the soul as well as 
the intellect of man. The exposition of Herbert 
Spencer is a very thorough piece of destructive criti- 
cism, dealing especially with the "First Principles" 
and the "Principles of Psychology." The author's 
summing up of the matter is that Spencer's philoso- 
phy, apart from the suggestions thrown out by the 
way throughout its course, has no value as a system, 
and that it has passed away with that reliance on 
physical science which was the intellectual feature of 
its generation and which gave it so great a vogue. 



Early American A11 who are interested in children's 
story-books story-books, except the children them- 

for children. 8e lves, will find pleasure and profit 
in Miss Rosalie V. Halsey's " Forgotten Books of the 
American Nursery : A History of the Development 
of the American Story-Book," published in Boston 
by Messrs. Charles E. Goodspeed & Co. From John 
Cotton's " Milk for Babes. Drawn out of the Breast 
of Both Testaments. Chiefly for the spiritual nour- 
ishme.nt of Boston Babes in either England: But 
may be of like use for any children," to Peter Parley's 
and Jacob Abbott's and Miss Sedgwick's little books 
of harmless fiction for innocent children, the author 
traces, in seven carefully-written chapters, the genesis 
of the American story-book for young people, bring- 
ing out for the benefit of the philosophical student 
of the subject the influence exerted by the spirit of 
each successive age upon the character of its juven- 
ile literature. It is this constant even though grad- 
ual change of atmosphere, in the family life and in 
the nursery as well as in the greater world, that 
largely accounts for the obsoleteness of most of the 
children's books of the past ; but the author puts it 
too strongly when she says that "there is nothing 
more rare in the fiction of any nation than the pop- 
ular child's story that endures." What, pray, are 
the favorite collections of fairy-stories and nursery 
rhymes made up of to-day if not of the good old 
tales and jingles that, in many cases, have in sub- 
stance if not in form come down from a more or 
less remote past ? Does our current adult fiction 
show as many hoary survivals ? Miss Halsey's book,

The life of ^ r * Francis Gribble, clever purveyor 

an imperial of breezy scandal, gives us in his 
adventuress. i atest vo i unie w h a t he calls "The 

Comedy of Catherine the Great" (Putnam). His 
title is a shrewd warning that he intends to deal, 
not with Russian politics or the serious side of 
Catherine's life, but solely or principally with her 
amours. Mr. Gribble does not reprobate his heroine, 
and hold her up as a horrible warning; he reminds 
us again and again that she was more sinned against 
than sinning, that her faults were the faults of her 
age and position, and that she was at bottom a very 
capable and very good-hearted woman. The latter 
quality he proves by abundant anecdote, the former 
he contents himself with repeating earnestly and 
frequently. The substance of his book, however, is 
a sensationally detailed account of the woman's end- 
less series of love affairs. Such works have not even 
the merit of historical trustworthiness. Mr. Gribble, 
who has undeniably put much labor into the making 
of his compilation and brought together material 
from a hundred different sources, conscientiously 
admits that many of the salacious morsels which he 
dishes up most carefully are only matters of rumor 
and cannot be verified. His book has little value 
for the historian, and in spite of the ostentation of a 
moral attitude it can scarcely be reckoned a treatise 
on morals. Nevertheless, it is a breathlessly inter- 
esting story, built of vigorous and rapid sentences 
and strewn from beginning to end with examples of 
witty phrase-making. If Mr. Gribble had chosen 
to study Catherine and her reign from a different 
and less questionable point of view, he might have 
produced a permanently valuable book, instead of 
merely a readable one. 

TWO superb " He who runs mav read " mi g nt seem 
architectural to be the best counsel to offer to an 
picture-books. aspiring student of architecture. Un- 
doubtedly, the training of the eye before the actual 
masterpieces of the builder's art is the most valuable 
apprenticeship. Yet for those who cannot take such 
a travel-course, good photographs are really not a 
bad substitute : they afford an easy means of making 
an art-pilgrimage by proxy. And we are all fond 
of this sedentary kind of travel, made so enticing 
recently by the perfecting of reproductive processes 
and the zeal of the publishers. Such books as 
Dr. Julius Baum's "Romanesque Architecture in 
France " and Signer Ricci's " Baroque Architecture 
and Sculpture in Italy" (Button) offer the most 
alluring opportunities to art-student and arm-chair 
tourist ; they are perfection in their class. Made up 
respectively of 226 and 274 full-page plates, these 
splendid folios present their subjects mainly through 
the range and choice of their illustrations ; they are 
practically art-albums, prepared by experts and pro- 
vided with brief introductions and full indexes. Our 



profit from such books is dependent, of course, upon 
our previous knowledge ; but not our pleasure. Even 
the most indolent arm-chair traveller will not be 
daunted by a prefatory essay which fills scarcely a 
dozen pages. He will skip it, pass at once to the 
plates, and feast his eyes thereon, his pleasure unal- 
loyed except by a possible consciousness of his ignor- 
ance. He will learn as the tourist learns, with or 
without a guide-book. And if he will not run, he need 
not even read! 

How to visit Specialization being as necessary in 
the English sight-seeing as in most other mat- 
cathedrais. tergj the English Cathedral tour finds 
much favor with travellers abroad. And since these 
wonderful buildings make a many-sided appeal 
through their history and associations as well as 
through their architecture many handbooks more 
or less satisfactory have been offered from time to 
time on the subject. The latest of these, "How 
to Visit the English Cathedrals" (Dodd), by Miss 
Esther Singleton, is by no means the least welcome. 
Those who are familiar with the long list of this 
writer's other works know her method. Frankly 
compiled from various sources duly acknowledged, 
the citations are tied together with a thread of 
original matter which adds greatly both to the 
value and the interest. The introductory chapter 
of thirty-one pages deals with "Styles of English 
Architecture"; the twenty-nine chapters following 
consider as many different cathedrals, and each is 
illustrated by several charming photographs. It is a 
book suitable for the rapid but intelligent traveller 
who may not have either time or inclination for ex- 
haustive study. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The name of Thomas Deloney will not commonly be 
found in manuals of the history of English literature, 
yet future compilers of such books will hardly be able 
to escape giving some attention to this Elizabethan 
novelist and poet, now that his complete works have 
been put forth by the Oxford Clarendon Press in a 
stout volume edited by Mr. Francis Oscar Mann. 

"Le Frangais et Sa Patrie," by Mr. L. Raymond 
Talbot (Sanborn), is a French reading-book for the first 
or second year, planned to put the student into posses- 
sion of much interesting information about French home 
life, and the history and geography of the country. The 
matter is partly conversational and partly epistolary. 
There are also pictures, songs, poems, notes, and a vocab- 
ulary. It seems to be a particularly praiseworthy text- 
book. 

If Miss Betham-Edwards's handsomely-illustrated 
volume, "In the Heart of the Vosges" (McClurg), 
had been entitled "In Gustave Dora's Country," with 
the appended " and other sketches," the reviewer would 
have had little occasion to find fault. One half of the 
book deals with regions outside the Vosges, while the 
first half has no eye for anyone but Dore". The admirer 
of the Alsatian artist will find much to interest and sat- 
isfy him in the notes concerning Dord's youth and his 
world-success ; and the testimony regarding the attitude

of the Alsatians toward the Prussian government is 
valuable. But it is strange to be led through "the 
heart of the Vosges " and hear no mention of the fine 
old Meistersaenger, Johann Georg Wickram, who there 
presided over the Meistergesangschule. And no less 
strange is it to meet no reminiscences of Walther und 
Hildegund, who made their famous flight and fought 
their valiant battle in these passes. 

The Boston Book Co. sends us " The Dramatic Index 
for 1911," being the third volume of an annual biblio- 
graphy of " articles and illustrations concerning the 
stage and its players in the periodicals of America and 
England, with a record of books on the drama and of 
texts of plays published during 1911." Mr. Frederick 
Winthrop Faxon is the compiler of this useful book of 
reference, which makes a stout volume of about two 
hundred and fifty pages. 

Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons are the American pub- 
lishers of "The Cambridge Manuals of Science and 
Literature," a useful enterprise not unlike the " Home 
University Library." New volumes at hand are " Prehis- 
toric Man," by Mr. W. L. H. Duckworth ; " The Nat- 
ural History of Clay," by Mr. Alfred B. Searle; "The 
Migration of Birds," by Mr. E. A. Coward; "Earth- 
worms and Their Allies," by Mr. Frank E. Beddard; 
and "The Modern Locomotive," by Mr. C. Edgar Allen. 

" Sir Eglamour " is not one of the most interesting 
of the Middle English romances ; but it is simple and 
brief, and hence well adapted to use in college classes. 
A carefully-prepared edition of the poem, intended for 
college use, has recently been made by Prof. Albert S. 
Cook and published by Messrs. Holt. The editor dis- 
penses with glossary and critical and interpretative notes, 
but explains difficult words and lines on the pages upon 
which they occur. A brief introduction gives necessary 
information as to the history of the poem and as to its 
more important analogues. 

A clear and convenient chart of the heavens that 
should find decided favor with amateur star-gazers is 
Mr. Albert Ross Parsons's " Road Map of the Stars " 
(Kennerley). It consists of forty-eight star maps, 
mounted on a strong piece of linen and folded to fit the 
pocket, showing in separate views (North, South, East, 
and West) the positions of the stars at any hour of 
any night in the year. Unfolded, as a single sheet, the 
entire circle of the constellations visible in the Northern 
Hemisphere are shown. An accompanying volume 
contains the same charts on separate pages, with explan- 
atory matter, tables, etc. 

It is a singular fact that the greatest of all Scandi- 
navian authors is no more than a name to English read- 
ers, and is not even that to the vast majority of them. 
Ludvig Holberg was not only the creator of Danish 
literature, but he was one of the most illustrious of the 
world's writers for the comic stage, making up, with 
Moliere and Goldoni, the great triad of modern comedy. 
He was, besides, philosopher, historian, and moralist, 
and altogether the embodiment of all the thought of 
his time to a degree in which Voltaire was perhaps his 
only rival. His comedies have never received any 
effective translation into English, for which reason we 
welcome the "Three Comedies by Ludvig Holberg" 
(Longmans), which Lieut.-Colonel H. W. L. Hume has 
just published. The translation is a poor one, and the 
selection is almost the last which we would have thought 
of making; but it is something to have any part of Hol- 
berg available in our language. 



KOTXS. 

It is announced that the subject of Mr. Bernard Shaw's 
coming play will be the fable of Androcles and the Lion. 

Mr. W. J. Henderson, the well-known musical critic, 
will publish through Messrs. Holt next autumn a novel 
entitled " The Soul of a Tenor." 

Mr. Andrew Lang is now engaged upon a history of 
English literature, from the beginnings to Swinburne. 
Messrs. Longmans will publish the work next autumn. 

Professor Bliss Perry of Harvard University is com- 
pleting a new volume of essays entitled " The American 
Mind," which Houghton Mifflin Co. will publish next 
autumn. 

Prince Kropotkin is revising a new edition of his pow- 
erful indictment of the English land question, " Fields, 
Factories and Workshops," which will appear, with many 
additions, in a few weeks. 

The two concluding volumes of the late John Bige- 
low's " Retrospections of an Active Life," covering the 
period from 1866 to 1879, will be published during the 
autumn by Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. 

" John Forster and his Friendships " is the title of a 
forthcoming book by Mr. R. Renton which is likely to 
present much new material concerning the famous 
biographer of Dickens, Goldsmith, Landor, and Sir 
John Eliot. 

Mr. E. T. Cook, author of the recently-published Life 
of Ruskin and joint editor with Mr. Wedderburn of the 
monumental " Library Edition " of Ruskin's works, has 
been chosen to write the authorized biography of 
Florence Nightingale. 

" Religion and Thought in Ancient Egypt," by Pro- 
fessor James H. Breasted, is announced for early pub- 
lication by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. Among 
the immediately forthcoming importations of this house 
is a volume on " Social Insurance in Germany," by 
Mr. W. H. Dawson, author of " The Evolution of Mod- 
ern Germany." 

A new biography of William Morris by Mr. Arthur 
Compton Rickett is announced by Messrs. Dent. It will 
contain a good deal of unpublished matter, and promises 
to throw fresh light upon Morris, both as a man and as 
a poet. We note that Messrs. Longmans announce a 
new and cheaper edition of Mr. Mackail's authorized 
biography, which first appeared in 1899. 

" The Correspondence of William Shirley," to be 
issued at once by the Macmillan Co., is the third in the 
series of letters of famous statesmen prominent in the 
colonial history of America issued under the auspices of 
the National Society of Colonial Dames, the previous 
publications being " The Correspondence of William 
Pitt " and " The Letters of Richard Henry Lee." 

Among immediately forthcoming Dutton publications 
are the following: " Posthumous Essays of John Churton 
Collins," edited by his son, Mr. L. C. Collins; "An In- 
troduction to the History of Life Insurance," by Mr. A. 
Fingland Jack, M. Com. ; " The Good Girl," a novel by 
Mr. Vincent O'Sullivan; and "The Roll-Call of Honour," 
a collection of inspiring biographies for younger readers 
by Sir A. T. Quiller-Couch. 

Anatole Leroy-Beaulieu, the French writer and pub- 
licist, died in Paris on June 16. He was the author of 
a long list of books dealing with the social and political 
life both of his own country and of Russia. Among his 
best-known works are the following : " L'Antiprotes- 
tantisme," " Etudes russes et europe'ennes," " Les Con- 



28 



THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



grdgations religieuses et 1'expansion de la France," 
" Christianisme et Socialisme," and " Les Juifs et 1'anti- 
semitisme." He was a Chevalier of the Legion of 
Honor and director of the Institute. Several of his 
books have appeared in English translation. 

A full selection from Bjornson's private correspond- 
ence, edited by Professor Halfdan Koht, a Norwegian 
writer well known as an authority on Ibsen, will before 
long be given to the public in probably three languages. 
The first volume, containing correspondence to the year 
1871, is expected to come from the press simultaneously 
in Copenhagen and Berlin, in the autumn, while an 
English edition is also under consideration. 

A third edition is now issued of that interesting and 
well-illustrated pamphlet, " The Work of the Cleveland 
Public Library with the Children." Prepared originally 
at the time of the convention of the National Educational 
Association in Cleveland, four years ago, it appeared in 
a second edition two years later. It contains thirty-two 
pages of descriptive matter, a map of Cleveland, with 
library districts and branches plainly indicated, and ten 
pages exhibiting the scheme of administration adopted 
by the library. 

William Watson Goodwin, known to thousands of 
school and college graduates by reason of his widely- 
used " Greek Grammar," " Greek Moods and Tenses," 
and an excellent edition of Xenophon's " Anabasis," died 
June 15, at his home in Cambridge. He was born 
at Concord, Mass., May 9, 1831. After taking his 
bachelor's degree at Harvard in 1851, he studied at 
three German universities, travelled in Italy and Greece, 
and served four years as tutor in the college that had 
given him his academic training, and was then, in 1860, 
appointed to the Greek chair which he held until his 
resignation in 1901, when he professed to have "taught 
himself out." That he was no mere grammarian is 
proved by the fact that he was the first Director of the 
American School of Classical Studies at Athens, and 
that his lectures at Harvard concerned themselves with 
broader interests than the niceties of the Greek tongue. 
His published version of Plutarch's " Morals " also 
shows him to have been something more than a gerund- 
grinder. In short, he was a fine example and exponent 
of academic culture at its best.

The Home University Library 

Cloth Bound 50c. per volume net ; by mail 56c. 



Points about THE HOME UNIVERSITY LIBRARY 

Every volume is absolutely new, and specially written for the Library. There 
are no reprints. 

Every volume is sold separately. Each has illustrations where needed, and 
contains a bibliography as an aid to further study. 

Every volume is written by a recognized authority on its subject, and the 
Library is edited by four eminent scholars GILBERT MURRAY, of Oxford ; 
H. A. L. FISHER, of Oxford ; J. ARTHUR THOMSON, of Aberdeen ; and W. T. 
BREWSTER, of Columbia. 

Every subject is of living and permanent interest. These books tell whatever 
is most important and interesting about their subjects. 



SOME COMMENTS ON THE SERIES AS A WHOLE: 

" Covering almost every conceivable intellectual interest from astronomy to socialism, written in a popular 
style by specialists, brief, clear and readable, above all cheap, they fill one of the gravest wants of modern in- 
telligence. Of real value to everyone interested, front whatever cause, in the achievements and the progress of 
society." Yale Review. 

" Excellent." The Outlook. " Exceedingly worth while." The Nation. 

" Each represents a three hours' traffic with the talking-power of a good brain, operating with the ease and 
interesting freedom of a specialist dealing with his own subject." The London Times. 

" The excellence of these books." The Dial. " This great series." Chicago Evening Post.

THE SCHOLAR IN POLITICS. 

Out of the political turmoil of the past month 
one result has emerged which is peculiarly grat- 
ifying to all who take a serious interest in our 
national life and problems. One of the great 
political parties has chosen as its candidate for 
the office of chief magistrate a man who embodies 
that ideal of the scholar in politics which has 
hitherto seemed to be impossible of realization 
in a democracy like ours, short-sighted in its vis- 
ion and deaf to the purely intellectual appeal. 
It is hard even now to believe that the incredi- 
ble has become fact, and equally hard to account 
for it, considering in what contempt the " intel- 
lectual" and the theorist are held by most of 
those who think themselves practical politicians. 
In a truly enlightened community nothing could 
be more natural than the selection for its leader 
of a man who had devoted his life to the inves- 
tigation of the problems of statecraft, and spent 
his days in teaching young men to understand 
them. Who should be competent to lead, if not 
one who for many years had given his attention 
to the questions for which leadership is expected 
to find answers, and who could bring to bear 
upon them a wide knowledge of the art of gov- 
ernment in all countries, at all times, and under 
all conditions ? Yet, plain as the matter is, there 
is a surprising number of persons who fail to see 
in a man of this type the most essential of all 
qualifications for high administrative office the 
wide range of knowledge, the trained analytical 
faculty, and the habit of forming disinterested 
judgments upon political issues. 

Although we have been a working democracy 
for upwards of a hundred years, we have in all 
that time acquired only a rudimentary percep- 
tion of what constitutes fitness for office. We 
have complacently witnessed the placing of men 
without scientific equipment in positions whose 
duties involved the management of observatories 
and laboratories and museums, we have seen with 
nothing more than a shrug of the shoulders, 
translated into the words "another political ap- 
pointment," the selection of men without expert 
knowledge for posts in which such knowledge 
was imperative, we have seen surgeons trans- 
formed into generals, and politicians into judges, 
and sportsmen into civil service commissioners, 
and illiterates into ministers and consuls, de

spatched to countries of which they could not 
even speak the language we have seen all these 
grotesque administrative misfits, and, if we have 
felt anything like adequate indignation, have 
failed to express it, and all because of our na- 
tional habit of viewing politics as a form of sport 
instead of as a business to be dealt with accord- 
ing to the dictates of reason and in a spirit of 
high seriousness. When it comes to choosing 
people for office ourselves, by exercising the 
sacred privilege of the ballot, we do not, once 
in a score of times, make a decent effort to find 
out whether the men for whom we are voting 
have either the knowledge or the character that 
the offices require. As far as knowledge goes, 
we pretend to believe that any American citizen 
can learn to do anything if he is only given an 
opportunity, and, as far as character goes, we 
take our chances, or fall back upon a cynical 
disbelief in the integrity of any man whose duties 
are found to conflict with his interests. 

Aside from the suspicion with which the 
scholar in politics is widely regarded, taking 
shape in abstract allegations barbed with such 
.damning epithets as theorist, visionary, Utopian, 
dreamer, idealist, and reformer, his entrance 
into the field has to encounter the very serious 
obstacle presented by the damaged reputations 
of men who have been supposed to be con- 
spicuous examples of the principle which he 
represents. We have undoubtedly had scholars 
in politics for whom the noblesse oblige of their 
rank has had no constraining force, and who 
promptly sold themselves to the devil as soon 
as they were taken up on the high mountain. 
Two of these lost souls are particularly prom- 
inent in our national affairs because their sin 
against the light has been more than commonly 
flagrant, but there are many others of lesser 
stature who, with the scholar's equipment, have 
not had the character needed to steel them in 
the hour of temptation, and so have helped to 
bring into disrepute what is nevertheless the 
unquestionable truth that high (and to a certain 
extent specialized) education is above all things 
else to be desired in a public officer. We must 
not be disheartened by the cases in which intel- 
lect has been put to shame by deed, but hold 
fast to the principle that education ought to 
count as a very large percentage of the total of 
what we require in a candidate for high public 
office. 

It is amazing that this matter should be even 
arguable in a country like the United States, 
which does more lip-service to education, and 
goes down deeper into its pocket to pay the 



bills, than any other on earth. But the fact is 
that along with our devotion to popular educa- 
tion we cherish as a nation a certain distrust of 
all education that goes beyond the elementary 
stages, excepting that which is definitely shaped 
to practical ends. The absurd notion that the 
higher education somehow disqualifies a man 
for the real work of life is entertained by a sur- 
prisingly large number of people, and urged by 
them with a zeal worthy of a better cause. It 
is but a step from this general prejudice to the 
more specific one that would hold it rather 
against a candidate for high office that his 
education had been of a nature to win for him 
academic honors, even if they were honors in 
the very field of scholarship that prepares a 
man to deal with political and economic prob- 
lems upon a basis of scientific knowledge. We 
take for granted that expert chemists are needed 
in the direction of our industrial organizations, 
and trained electricians and mathematicians in 
the management of our traction systems and 
engineering enterprises. But we balk at the 
idea that our executive and legislative officers 
need to be trained in the niceties of interna- 
tional law or the theories of the tariff, and scout 
the notion that a knowledge of political and 
economic history can alone supply the examples 
and the warnings by which a government may 
learn what is wise and do what is right. We 
prefer to do what unintelligent impulse directs 
and interested ignorance counsels, disregarding 
the accumulated experience of mankind which 
might so easily save us from mistaken courses 
and pernicious policies. In the impending pres- 
idential campaign, when almost for the first 
time in our history we have the opportunity of 
placing a mind trained in political science at the 
head of national affairs, we shall have to contend 
with a stout opposition whose chief "argument" 
will be the multiplication of cheap gibes about 
misguided pedagogues who foolishly aspire to 
become statesmen. 

Governor Baldwin, in the last number of 
" The Yale Review," has some pertinent remarks 
about placing educated men in public office. 

" The indirect consequences of any new piece of 
legislation are far more numerous and far more import- 
ant than those which are direct. Only well-trained 
minds can anticipate many of them. And the highest 
education can never enable a man to forecast them all. 
In America one is quite sure that well-trained minds, 
sooner or later, will trace out these consequences. This 
falls to our judges. They will be quick to see how an 
alteration in one of the rules of law may affect the 
working of others, because this will tell in determining 
whether the new statute does or does not square with 
the constitutional guaranties of individual right. Often

its effect will be found such as to produce a benefit to 
a few at the cost of injustice to the community. He 
who finds this out first, without waiting for some law- 
suit to develop the wrong, has won a place among 
public benefactors. Still more of a benefactor is the 
member of a legislature who perceives the impractica- 
bility of some such proposition, before it can take the 
shape of law, and see to it that it is rejected." 

All of this illustrates the importance of Bastiat's 
"Ce qu'on voit et ce qu'on ne voit pas.'' It is 
what people do not foresee of the consequences 
of the legislation for which they clamor that 
makes all the mischief. It is the special func- 
tion of the trained mind in office, of the scholar 
in politics, to trace out these ulterior conse- 
quences, and, perceiving them to be seriously 
dangerous to prosperity, to justice, and even to 
liberty, to stand firmly against them, no matter 
at what cost of immediate public favor. He 
may suffer for his stand at the time, but he will 
have his reward in the end, if he only have the 
patience to wait. " The huge world will come 
round to him" when the clamor has died away. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 

THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AS AN EDUCATIONAL FORCE 

was a subject of marked prominence at the thirty- 
fourth annual conference of the American Library 
Association, just held at Ottawa, Canada. The con- 
viction was emphasized that the library constitutes 
not only a great civic force, but the one educational 
agency which must be relied upon to reach the citi- 
zenship of the country, since it is only a small minor- 
ity who are privileged to give up other occupations 
in order to attend academic institutions. This feeling 
was voiced especially in an address by Mr. William 
H. Hatton of Wisconsin, who said that "Society is 
required to educate the man of forty just as much as 
the boy of five; the training of the school can only 
be a beginning in learning how to assimilate knowl- 
edge. The student should be trained to find knowl- 
edge for himself. There is no place more fitted to 
accomplish this task than the library. The public 
library is the university of the people. It is the 
dominant factor in civic efficiency." Another dis- 
tinct impression received was that it is more than 
ever the thought of the library profession that good 
librarianship demands a keen sense of society's needs, 
together with a clear appreciation of literary values ; 
that knowledge of people and books is more import- 
ant than the technical side of library administration. 
That this conception was so definitely impressed 
upon those in attendance was in a large measure 
due to the preliminary work of the first woman who 
has ever been president of the A. L. A., Mrs. Theresa 
West Elmendorf of Buffalo. It was in the main her 
views upon this subject which were worked out upon 
the programme, and her personality which dominated 
the conference. Our Chicago librarian, Mr. Henry 



E. Legler, won merited recognition in the form of 
a unanimous election to the presidency of the Asso- 
ciation for the coming year. The eloquent and 
progressive head of the University of Minnesota 
bore to Ottawa the greetings of the National Edu- 
cation Association, and delivered one of the best 
addresses of the week. An especially enjoyable 
session was the fourth, for which a Dominion Day 
programme had been prepared, in which Sir Wilfrid 
Laurier and other notables took part. On the whole, 
this year's conference was one of the most interest- 
ing and stimulating that have been held. More than 
700 members were in attendance, and the bonds 
uniting library workers in this country with those 
across the Canadian border were more closely knit. 

" GUIDE-POST " REFORMERS OF OUR LANGUAGE in 
respect to its spelling or, in other words, those 
who cheerfully consent to point the doubtful and 
difficult road to some imaginary orthographic happy 
land, but prefer for their own part to stay where 
they are and bear those ills they have rather than 
fly to others that they know not of receive a word 
of reproof in the June issue of that vivacious organ 
of a doleful cause, the "Simplified Spelling Bul- 
letin." In an editorial paragraph we read: "As one 
of our members has put it, too many reformers are 
inclined to take the offis of a gide-post, and thus to 
point bravely the road of reform, while taking no 
steps themselvs. We need gide-posts, but if the 
road of reform is not traveld by some more pedes- 
trians, to say nothing of those who prefer the more 
rapid rate of vehicular progression, the grass will 
grow, and the evening sun will throw a tender but 
fading light upon the faithful gide-post, with its 
sturdy motto, 'Here I am, here I stay.'" The 
printed list of the officers and board of the S.S.S. 
(the official abbreviation for Simplified Spelling 
Society) contains so many names of writers and 
others whom the world in general has had no 
reason to suspect of inoculation with the S. S. virus, 
that one is inclined to believe there may indeed be 
not a few of these "gide-post" reformers in the 
S. S. S. ranks. The general tone of this number of 
the "Bulletin" conveys a certain sense of some- 
thing like despondency in the cause. Possibly this 
is a false impression; certainly it need not be the 
one given by the following paragraph, from the 
department of facetice, contributed by a correspon- 
dent: "One man to whom I had the BULLETIN 
sent was suffering from prejuditis and fossilization 
of the spelling bump. After taking three bottles 
of your cure he shows markt symptoms [why not 
simptoms?] of improvement, the foren substances 
o, g and h in his through having been painlessly re- 
moved." . . . 

THE CALUMNIATED BOOK-PUBLISHER finds an 
eloquent advocate in Mr. Filson Young, who writes 
ably in his defence in the London " Eye- Witness." 
Much has been said and printed about the sins of 
publishers, almost nothing about those of authors in 



38 



THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



their dealings with these same wicked publishers; 
societies have been formed for protecting the author 
from his hereditary foe, the publisher, but no societies 
exist for shielding the publisher from the madness 
or malevolence or unreasonableness of the author. 
" I have taken considerable interest in this question," 
says Mr. Young, "and both as an author and a pub- 
lisher's reader have had opportunities of examining 
it from both sides. Since my income is derived solely 
from writing, and not from publishing, I am naturally 
on the author's side; but I am bound to admit that 
in most of the cases of discontent and jealousy which 
exist, the wrong is on the side of the author. It is 
quite commonly supposed by the world at large that 
publishers are a dangerous set of criminals, who in 
reality sell immense editions of every book they pub- 
lish, but only account for a small number of copies 
to the author. And it seriously believes also that 
except for the vigilance of societies and agents, au- 
thors would all be starving in the gutter and publish- 
ers would all be millionaires. But I know more rich 
authors than publishers." Most assuredly one half 
of the world does not know how the other half has 
to struggle and contend with all sorts of unimagined 
and indescribable difficulties. Life is a rough road 
for most of us, and not for the publisher any more 
than for anyone else has it been sandpapered down 
to a polished smoothness. 



THE PRIMROSE PATH OF LETTERS or, rather, 
what is imagined by the uninitiated to be the flower- 
carpeted road travelled by those who earn their bread 
by writing will doubtless, as a matter of fact, always 
have more thorns than roses for the feet of the way- 
farers. But a pleasing fiction will survive. A rather 
well-known writer of our acquaintance received a 
letter, such as probably many other prominent writers 
have received, asking, as if it were the simplest 
thing in the world, advice that would enable the 
ingenuous correspondent to become a successful 
author. Unintentionally diverting as this letter was, 
an even more amusing one, addressed likewise to a 
person known in the literary world, is printed in 
" Public Libraries " for June. " Pardon this intru- 
sion upon your time," it begins, " but seeing your like- 
ness in a magazine and reading some of your articles 
prompts me to ask a favor of you and it is if you will 
write me a short article on ' The Novels of Maurice 
Hewlett.' I know you will think me very presump- 
tuous but it will be no exertion for you and will be 
granting a great favor." It continues, with a mix- 
ture of frankness and flattery : " I do n't believe you 
want to be paid for every article, do you, when you 
will be conferring such a favor? Your countenance 
appeals to me and so I write asking this favor. I 
have access to so few of his books and really do not 
care for him as a writer, so I find it quite a task to 
prepare a lengthy article for our literary club on 
the subject, especially as I am a very busy mother 
and have had so much sickness and have so short a 
time to prepare an article. If you can write me a 



humorous statement or two on the subject please do 
so, as long dry articles are so tiresome." What a vast 
amount of benefit that busy mother must get from 
her literary club! 

A MOVING APPEAL to the citizens of St. Joseph, 
Missouri, to visit and use more freely and frequently 
their excellent public library has been made in the 
past year through the agency of a local moving- 
picture theatre, which, says Librarian Rush in his 
unusually attractive and cleverly illustrated Report, 
"kindly exhibited a specially prepared lantern slide 
showing at each performance photographic repro- 
ductions of the Library buildings, together with the 
following note: 'Your Free Public Library has ar- 
ranged with this management to select interesting 
books and magazine articles upon the historical, lit- 
erary, and industrial subjects treated in these pic- 
tures. It is a bright idea to see something good and 
then learn more about it.' " Even more moving than 
this appeal would have been, let us say, a cinemato- 
graphic representation of some of the library's bene- 
ficent activities. For instance, a worried club-woman, 
seeking material for a paper to be read at the next 
meeting of the St. Joseph Culture Club, might be 
pictured in the process of applying for and promptly 
obtaining just the book or books that she needs, and 
departing with smiles of gratitude on her face and 
her precious data under her arm. Or the simple 
ceremony of applying for and receiving a book at 
the delivery desk might be thrown on the screen, to 
show how prompt and efficient is the library service. 
If all the world, or at least all the juvenile world, 
will endanger its eye-sight by visiting the moving- 
picture show, why not give it something well worth 
seeing, and worth thinking about afterward? 


A HERO AND HIS VALET are not always pictured 
in such pleasant relations to each other as in the 
" Recollections of Guy de Maupassant," by his body- 
servant, Francois a French book that has recently 
achieved the distinction of being translated into En- 
glish. Not all valets, it is true, are equal to the 
task of putting their reminiscences of their masters 
into book-form, else we might have more refutations 
of the familiar dictum ascribed, with varying weight 
of authority, to Madame de SeVigne", to Madame 
Cornuel, to Marshal Catinat, and perhaps to others. 
Evidently Francois was a faithful servant and a 
minute observer; and that, with all this minuteness 
of observation under the somewhat disenchanting 
conditions of domestic service, he still felt sufficiently 
moved with admiration to present the world with a 
portrait of his master in undress, so to say, speaks 
well for both master and servant. In addition to 
those intimate personal details about which only a 
valet would be qualified to write fully and accurately, 
there are matters touched upon of far greater pith 
and moment, questions of literary taste, even, and 
discussions (somewhat one-sided, naturally) of Zola 
and his writings. Maupassant, as appears from his 



1912.] 



THE DIAL 



39 



valet's book, was a veritable steam engine for work 
when once the creative impulse seized him ; he could 
cover no fewer than thirty-seven foolscap pages in 
a day. Those who wish to know the real Guy de 
Maupassant, to become better acquainted with the 
man behind his writings, will not fail to read these 
entertaining recollections from the pen of Francois. 


THE DWINDLING OF THE BACCALAUREATE, the 

degree that a few decades ago stood as a symbol for 
all that was best in college culture for an intimate 
and loving acquaintance with the humanities, and an 
ardent devotion to the highest ideals both of scholar- 
ship and of conduct, conduct being the very art of 
arts, and so not to be ignored by the holder of a B. A. 
diploma is sadly attested by this year's record of 
our college and university graduates. In a list of 
thirty-nine of our leading institutions of higher learn- 
ing, graduating at the recent commencement nearly 
thirteen thousand students, there were bestowed not 
quite four thousand degrees of bachelor of arts, or 
less than thirty-three per cent of the total number of 
diplomas awarded. Only one of these colleges and 
universities is found to confine itself, with commend- 
able restraint, to the B. A. degree as the official attes- 
tation that the student has successfully completed its 
curriculum ; and that one is, of course, a New En- 
gland country college Williams. The sister insti- 
tution at Amherst graduated ninety-five students (to 
Williams's ninety-three), but allowed twenty of these 
to go forth with some sort of substitute for the time- 
honored parchment of our ancestors probably a B. S. 
diploma. Lehigh University makes, on the whole, 
about the poorest showing in this connection, with 
only four B. A.'s to its credit, out of eighty-five grad- 
uates ; and, sad to relate, the University of Vermont 
sends forth this year but five bachelors of arts in a 
graduating class of ninety-six afalling-off of three 
from last year's B. A. record. At this rate, the time 
may come, within our own lifetime, when bachelors of 
arts will constitute a smaller and more distinguished 
company of scholars than doctors of philosophy. 


AN EXPERIMENT IN CO-OPERATIVE BOOK-BUYING 

forms the subject of an interesting section in the 
latest Report of the John Crerar Library, and it 
seems not unlikely to lead to still further and larger 
enterprises of the same sort. After a preliminary 
reference to the matter, the librarian continues: 
"The purchases of the year were greatly affected 
in character by the experiment already mentioned. 
Four libraries, Harvard University, Northwestern 
University, The University of Chicago, and The 
John Crerar, sent a joint representative to Europe. 
They were fortunate in securing, through the cour- 
tesy of Northwestern University, the services of its 
Librarian, Dr. Walter Lichtenstein, who had very 
special qualifications for the task. Dr. Lichtenstein 
brought together for Harvard its Hohenzollern 
Collection, and in so doing obtained an exceptional 



familiarity with the European book trade." It is 
understood that the results of this venture were 
satisfactory to all concerned. In the case of the 
library of which we are now speaking, "the pur- 
chases cover all the departments of the Library 
and, indeed, most of the individual subjects. The 
principal object of the experiment was to obtain 
books which could not be obtained through the 
regular channels of trade, but it is pleasant to be 
able to add that, after allowing for all expenses, the 
purchases were made at less cost than they could 
have been made through these channels." 



SIR SIDNEY COLVIN'S WORK AT THE BRITISH MU- 
SEUM, as keeper of prints and drawings since 1884, 
draws to itself some merited attention just now by 
reason of his recent retirement from the post. Though 
best known to the reading public as editor of the Edin- 
burgh edition of Stevenson's works and of Stevenson's 
letters, there are other and greater achievements to 
his credit than the editing of R. L. S. Scholar and 
fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, he was elected 
in 1873 Slade professor of fine art at that university, 
and was also director of the Fitzwilliam Museum at 
Cambridge from 1876 until he went to the British 
Museum in 1884. The pre-Raphaelite movement 
found in him an eloquent advocate in the days of its 
unpopularity. His acquaintance with Whistler and 
his high opinion of that eccentric artist's work are 
matters of record as is also Whistler's characteristic 
treatment of his admirer. In every way equipped 
for his duties at the British Museum, Sir Sidney 
acquired a reputation for expert knowledge of the 
old masters second to that of few or none in En- 
gland ; and his diplomacy and tact in the discharge 
of those duties secured for his department valuable 
accessions that another man might not have secured 
at all, or only at a considerably greater cost in 
money. The story is current of a dealer who, after 
making a sale to the keeper of prints and drawings, 
repented the transaction and grumbled: "Colvin is 
so [profane adverb] pleasant he gets things for 
nothing." 

A LIBRARY IN A WATER-TANK, Occupying some 

of the space once devoted to water, enjoys a security 
from fire (the tank being of iron) which not every 
library can boast. The Chicago Public Library, as 
we now know it, has grown from a nucleus of about 
three thousand volumes given to the city forty years 
ago, just after the great fire, by the late Thomas 
Hughes and others, authors and publishers and lit- 
erary and scientific societies that he had interested 
t in the cause, in order that Chicago might no longer 
suffer the reproach of having no library in the least 
degree worthy of so large and enterprising a city; 
and in the old water-tank on the site of the present 
Rookery Building the books thus secured through 
English generosity were first shelved and made 
accessible to the public. Since then the growing 
collection, which now numbers nearly half a mil-

lion volumes, has been four times removed to new 
and larger quarters, and to-day there are, in addi- 
tion to the fine central library building at Michigan 
Avenue and Washington Street, twenty-five branch 
libraries, one hundred and sixteen delivery stations, 
nine employees' libraries in industrial and commer- 
cial establishments, sixty-six classroom libraries in 
schools, and two travelling libraries. These facts 
and figures, with others of interest and a classified 
list of recent accessions, are to be found in the June 
number of the library's interesting "Book Bulletin." 


THE DEMAND FOR GOOD BOOKS OF MODERATE 

PRICE appears rather to grow than to be satiated 
with the increasing output of such excellent series as 
"Everyman's Library," the "Temple Classics," and 
the "Home University Library." "Everyman's" 
has passed well beyond the half-thousand mark in 
the number of its titles, and the "Home University 
Library" of authoritative little manuals devoted to 
various branches of learning is now circulating to the 
extent of half a million copies of its various issues. 
One watcher of the book-market and critic of litera- 
ture attributes the present social unrest a discon- 
tent that is the beginning of progress largely to the 
wide circulation of these excellent, thought-provoking 
textbooks and reprints. No longer, it appears, does 
the popular novel or the illustrated magazine, or even 
the many- paged and profusely-pictured Sunday news- 
paper, quench the public thirst for reading matter. 
If this is really so, and if the inexpensive reprint 
and the low-priced scientific or economic or historical 
treatise are at the same time creating and respond- 
ing to a more wholesome craving, there is cause for 
felicitation. ... 

OUR AMERICAN " DEBRETT," instead of being a 
blue-book of the peerage, is a red-book of men and 
women of achievement. It lays emphasis rather on 
the qualities commonly associated with red blood 
than on those traditionally characteristic of blue. 
The current issue of "Who's Who in America" 
(Vol. VII., 1 912-1913), fresh from the hands of its 
enterprising publishers, contains nearly three thou- 
sand new names ; which means that about eight times 
a day, during the period of the book's compilation, 
fame has struck some hitherto obscure person and 
made of him or her a Who. Presumably, too, the 
rate of mortality among the Whos must in the long 
run about equal the birth-rate. Contemplating this 
endless procession of the illustrious from the cradle 
to the grave, with their achievement of renown 
marked by admission to " Who 's Who," one might be 
tempted by a sense of the transitoriness of all thingsr 
mundane, great as well as small, to essay a labored 
and clumsy parody of certain familiar lines of Ten- 
nyson, somewhat as follows: 

Fill the cup and fill the can, 

Have a rouse before the morn ; 
Each three hours a Who expires, 

Each three hours a Who is born. 



COMMUNICA TION. 



RESEARCH AND INTERCOMMUNICATION: 

A PARTIAL SURVEY OF WAYS AND MEANS. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Of bibliographical undertakings, large and small, 
past, present, and future, there are many, and they are 
of great utility; but it is not the chief purpose of this 
note to deal therewith. We have in mind rather those 
publications and organizations which afford assistance 
in current research, or through the medium of which 
investigators can be placed in direct communication 
with each other. It is generally recognized now that 
the serious student is no longer content with printed 
literature. He must seek, and, if possible, secure the 
last word on the subject in point. He may join some 
one or more of the societies, national or international, 
devoted to the matters or problems of interest to him, 
but he will still find that there is a chasm which cannot 
be bridged over except by some one general clearing- 
house to which, in certain emergencies, to apply. 

With this state of affairs, it was not surprising to hear 
of the creation of such an institution as " Die Briicke " 
(The Bridge), under the presidency of Prof. Dr. Wil- 
helm Ostwald, of Leipsic, and having its headquarters 
at 30, Schwindstrasse, Munich. The minimum yearly 
subscription for membership is only six marks (about 
$1.50). Dr. Ostwald has already, according to report, 
donated to "Die Briicke " the sum of one hundred thou- 
sand marks ($24,000) from his private fortune. An 
active international propaganda will, no doubt, soon be 
commenced by " Die Briicke," which has so far been 
giving special attention to the organization of its work 
in Germany. It will probably establish, in due course, 
branch organizations in the various countries, and will 
begin the publication of an official organ of intercom- 
munication. The scope of " Die Briicke," unlike that 
of any other previously existing body, is unlimited as 
to subject. Its members will be privileged to submit 
queries on any imaginable topic. It will seek affiliation 
with all other institutions, societies, etc., throughout the 
world. Among its first serious tasks, therefore, will be 
the compilation of a complete list of the almost innumer- 
able organizations in existence, with some indication of 
their scope and purpose. True, this was largely accom- 
plished a few years ago by the Carnegie Institution, in 
its " Handbook of Learned Societies in America," and in 
its as yet unedited lists for foreign countries; but there 
remains nevertheless ample room for the good work 
undertaken by " Die Briicke." Its ultimately large corps 
of correspondents throughout the civilized world will 
form a very strong working organization. 

We have chosen to present first this international pro- 
ject in its latest form, before dealing with some of the 
national undertakings, in order to have the broadest 
possible ground-work for that ultimate coordination of 
endeavor which is rapidly becoming so essential. 

In England, the old London "Notes and Queries," 
which has appeared weekly since 1849 and is rendered 
accessible by many excellent indexes, is an exceedingly 
useful means of research and intercommunication, par- 
ticularly on subjects of literature, grammar, linguistics, 
philology, history, biography, heraldry, genealogy, folk- 
lore, bibliography, and allied matters. There also exist 
in Great Britain and Ireland numerous local " Notes 
and Queries " magazines, and many societies of varied 



1912.]

purposes. Among those whose objects should be of gen- 
eral interest is the British Institute of Social Service, 
4 Tavistock Square, London, W. C., which has an offi- 
cial organ, " Progress." In seeking a likely candidate 
for appointment as the British representative of " Die 
Briicke," however, we would most naturally turn to such 
an organization as The Information and Agency Bureau, 
J. W. Shaw, Director, 24 Hart Street, Holborn, Lon- 
don, W. C. Among Mr. Shaw's current investigations 
is one relating to the production of crockery, china, 
earthenware, etc., in the various countries, in behalf of 
a company making a patented tunnel oven for firing 
pottery. This is at least suggestive of the commercial 
possibilities of such a clearing-house. 

In France, we have " L'Interme'diaire des Chercheurs 
et Curieux," appearing in Paris three times a month, 
since 1864. A general index to its contents to the year 
1896 has been printed. A complete set of this periodical 
may be found in the library of the University of Chicago. 
Many are the quaint and interesting contributions in 
its columns, relating to French history and art. We 
must not overlook, in passing, the existence of the 
Institut International pour la diffusion des Experiences 
Sociales, under the general direction of Prof. Dr. 
Rodolphe Broda, 59 Rue Claude Bernard, Paris. Its 
official organ, "Les Documents du Progres," is inter- 
esting and useful. The French representation of " Die 
Briicke " might, perhaps, be assigned to the Institut 
du Mois Scientifique et Industriel, in Paris, or to the 
Association de Bibliographic et de Documentation Sci- 
entifique, Industrielle et Commerciale, of which the 
Directeur is M. Jules Garc.on, 40 bis Rue Fabert, Paris 
(viie). 

As to Germany, " Die Briicke " itself, with headquar- 
ters in Munich, will doubtless provide its own national 
bureau. It might receive valuable assistance from such 
an organization as the Institut fiir Internationale!! 
Austausch fortschrittlicher Erfahrungen (International 
Institute for the interchange of progressive experi- 
ences), of which the official organ, " Dokumente des 
Fortschritts," is becoming more and more widely known. 
The Secretary is Prof. J. H. Epstein, 22 Hermannstrasse, 
Frankfurt-am-Main. 

In the United States, we think first of the Smith- 
sonian Institution, with its efficient International Ex- 
change through which, indeed, interrelations with " Die 
Briicke " were established April 30, 1912, and the 
interchange of documents begun. The Carnegie Insti- 
tution, also richly endowed, is, like the Smithsonian, 
carrying out a liberal policy for the extension of use- 
ful knowledge. The scope of both those beneficent 
bodies, however, is restricted, for the most part, to 
matters of science, pure and applied. " The Scientific 
American " inaugurated many years ago a column 
for notes and queries which is much patronized by its 
readers. " The Publisher and Retailer " (New York) 
for October, 1911 (pages 17-19), printed a useful list 
of American societies devoted to child-welfare and 
other subjects, which are willing to answer questions 
within their scope. Something of this kind was also 
attempted by "Special Libraries" for June, 1911 
(pages 54-58), but a more nearly complete list appears 
in the front pages of the current issues of " The Sur- 
vey." It remained, however, for Boston to establish the 
first Co-operative Information Bureau of unrestricted 
scope, and to form a card-index of all its members, with 
notes of their special knowledge. This brings these 
scattering remarks, at last, to the concrete proposition 



that there is great need of an American Co-operative 
Information Bureau, with branches in all the principal 
libraries, universities, colleges, and commercial clubs of 
the country, and with its own official organ of inter- 
communication to be issued monthly. Such an organi- 
zation, with headquarters in Chicago as the commercial 
and railroad centre, and where the library facilities are 
of the best, could soon become of great practical use- 
fulness. It might also act as the American representa- 
tive of " Die Briicke." The present time seems oppor- 
tune for serious consideration of such a project. In 
this connection it is well to call attention to the Special 
Libraries Association, which is the central organ for a 
number of scattering and, to some extent, unrelated 
institutions covering a large field of important work 
which is in great need of organization and co-operative 
effort, a fertile field which gives every promise of an 
abundant harvest. 

To the support of such a banner might rally the 
leading commercial and industrial bodies of the country, 
provided that, at the same time, adequate means are 
established for the necessary intercommunication as to 
current investigations. 

To facilitate discussion and definite action, the follow- 
ing rough draft of a prospectus is appended : 

PROSPECTUS OF THE AMERICAN CO-OPERATIVE 

INFORMATION BUREAU. 
OBJECTS : 

(a) To furnish a central body or clearing-house for the 
interchange of authentic information on all subjects of science, 
technology, history, commerce, transportation, travel, and all 
other matters without restriction. 

(b) To encourage co-operation in the interchange of useful 
information and for that purpose establish branches in all the 
principal libraries, universities, and other institutions of learn- 
ing throughout the United States, as well as to seek affiliation 
with similar institutions and societies in all parts of the world. 

(c) To place investigators into direct communication with 
each other when mutually desired. 

(d) To make special inquiries for the benefit of members. 

(e) To publish an official organ " Intercommunication," 
to be issued monthly at a yearly subscription price of about 
$3.00, of which a small portion, to be determined, may be re- 
tained by the local branch sending subscriptions. (The con- 
tents of each issue of the journal will be arranged in order of 
subject according to the decimal system of classification, 
thus bringing conveniently together all items of allied inter- 
est. Each yearly volume will be accompanied by a complete 
analytical index.) 
PRIVILEGES : 

All members shall have the privilege of submitting briefly 
worded queries on any subject without restriction, but each 
separate query shall be accompanied by an addressed envel- 
ope duly stamped for return postage. 
COST, ETC. : 

There shall be no membership fees beyond the subscription 
price of the official organ, but the bureau shall not be expected 
to undertake without charge special researches of an expen- 
sive character for the benefit of any single member ; neither 
will the bureau assume the responsibility of getting answers 
to all queries nor guarantee the accuracy of information ob- 
tained through its medium. 

Comment and criticism will show needed modifica- 
tions and improvements, but something of this char- 
acter is required in our highly specialized and rapidly 
moving life. Will America lag behind her sister 
nations in this great work ? Will Chicago overlook this 
excellent opportunity to add to her prestige and to her 
sphere of usefulness? EUGENE F. McPiKE.

Ax INTIMATE VIEW OF A GREAT 
PAINTER.* 



Mr. Daingerfield's book on George Inness 
is a great service to all who desire to know the 
development of American landscape painting. 
It is not an attempt at a biography, or even at 
a critical estimate, but a personal record per- 
sonal not in the gossippy but in the artistic sense. 
Mr. Daingerfield had particular opportunities 
for knowing Inness thoroughly as an artist, and 
his essay gives us a sketch based on intimate 
details. The painter's development in power, 
his effort first for a command of form and com- 
position, then for color, atmosphere, value ; his 
technical theories of painting or of composition, 
his eccentric doings-over, his search for obscure 
laws of color ; his personal character, his inten- 
sity, vigor, impulsiveness, courage, these things 
are given us by an authority, and we must always 
be glad to have them. 

We are unfortunately lacking in studies like 
this on the work of our great painters. Whoever 
would understand their works must either be 
content with the paintings themselves as he may 
be able to see them in the public galleries or in 
occasional exhibitions, or he must rely upon the 
general histories of American painting which, 
however excellent, must lack whatever value 
would come from the authors' being provided with 
independent studies of the painters with whom 
they had to deal. Both these methods leave a 
good deal to be desired. Our galleries, as a rule, 
do not attach much importance to American 
landscape, or, if they do, they are unable to carry 
out in any systematic way such a selection and 
arrangement as would serve as a guide to the 
student. The Metropolitan Museum in New 
York, for instance, and the New York Public 
Library have a good many pictures by American 
landscape painters, but their examples are only 
by accident representative pictures, and their 
catalogues give very little about them of use to 
the student. Our histories of American paint- 
ing are generally based upon the particular 
knowledge of the authors ; and although such is 
the very best foundation for such works, yet it 
is a great advantage to be able to correct or 
modify one's own impression by the studies and 
opinions of others. Of such discussions there 
are on this subject very few. 

* GEORGE INNESS: The Man and His Art. By Elliott 
Daingerfield. Illustrated. New York : Frederic Fairchild 
Sherman. 



Of course it may easily be alleged that the his- 
tory of American landscape has not been, until 
recently, a matter of great artistic interest or 
importance. The Hudson River, Lake George, 
or White Mountain School, it may be pointed 
out, is hopelessly antiquated, and its pictures 
may be relegated to the lumber-room without 
loss. The pictures of George Inness, in like 
manner, are pushed into obscurity by others who 
feel that American landscape painting began, 
for the purposes of the artist, with the followers 
of Monet. All this may be quite true from the 
standpoint of the painter or the art-student 
commonly so-called. And yet I feel sure that 
an element of national interest that occupied so 
large a place in the mind of the people as did 
American landscape ought not to be allowed to 
fall into obscurity, if only from the standpoint 
of American history. It is true that schools and 
manners have succeeded each other, and that to 
those who love the present manner that of the 
past may be absurd. But such things have their 
ebb and flow. In the matter of subject only, 
which an amateur may understand more about 
than of the matter of technique, there have been 
very great changes. Forty years ago the pupils 
of Hunt sought out a pair of fence-bars to paint, 
just as twenty years later the disciples of Monet 
were satisfied with a haystack done in a dozen 
different lights. Both spoke scornfully of the 
"panoramic " views that had delighted the older 
men. But in the last few years the landscapes 
which one sees are as likely as not to exhibit 
wide stretches of country, while the pair of bars 
and the haystack seem rather dull. Inness 
himself reacted against the followers of Thomas 
Cole, who, Mr. Daingerfield thinks, borrowed the 
worst in the empty classicism of Europe. They 
painted mountains and lakes: Inness painted a 
pasture or an apple-orchard. Yet the George 
Inness medal was awarded this year for a picture 
of Lake Louise in the Canadian Rockies, a sub- 
ject quite as romantic as the " Mount Corcoran " 
of Bierstadt. There is certainly much in the 
painting of the earlier men, and of Inness too, 
that has merely gone out of fashion. Their real 
character and spirit will generally be found well 
worth looking into and studying. 

All of this may seem far too long an introduc- 
tion to a comment on a book on the painting of 
George Inness. Indeed, it may be said that 
Inness is the one great exception to the general 
view just remarked. 1 do not think he is. It is 
true that Inness is at the present day much more 
highly esteemed by the general picture-lover than 
any who preceded or many who have followed 



1912.]

him. Compared with Cole, Durand, Church, 
Winslow Homer, I presume Inness is to most 
people a sun among stars. There is a good rep- 
resentation of his pictures in most large galleries 
and in the great private collections. Chicago is 
especially fortunate in this respect, for the Butler 
collection is the best to be found anywhere. 
But there is yet no very thorough or satisfac- 
tory study of his work, nor is there agreement 
as to its value. 

Mr. Daingerfield's book does not precisely try 
to fill this lack. As has been said, it does not 
pretend even to be an estimate ; it is one of those 
preliminary studies of so much value to the critic. 
Mr. Daingerfield tells us things about Inness 
that no one else knew things that one would 
want to be sure to take account of in getting to 
a true appreciation of his noble and beautiful 
art. It is a most attractive and interesting pic- 
ture of his master that he gives us, partly per- 
sonal though not too much so, partly artistic, 
with detail of method and ideas that must be of 
value to the technical student. 

It will not be a very important matter that I 
should not agree with Mr. Daingerfield in his 
view of Inness. I could not, of course, pretend 
to an opinion of much value in comparison with 
his in the matter of painting. Just the value of 
Inness's technique in comparison with all that 
has come in since his day is something about 
which I should have but the personal taste of 
any amateur. But so far as the pictures are 
concerned, there are certain points remarked by 
Mr. Daingerfield on which one who is not a 
painter may fairly, I believe, desire to have an 
independent opinion. 

Chief of these matters is the view that Inness 
really had more love and knowledge of Nature 
than many a man before him, or indeed beside 
him or after him, who could not paint so well. 
Mr. Daingerfield says "the frail, weak and 
altogether insipid effort of those about him was 
distasteful; they borrowing the worst in the 
empty classicism of Europe produced nothing 
upon which such such a nature could lean, nor 
from which learn even the rudiments of land- 
scape art" (p. 10). And he further gives us to 
understand that the contemporaries of Inness's 
younger days were apostles of the brown tree 
in the foreground (p. 9), and that their method 
was opposed to copying the landscape "he saw 
with his own eyes " (p. 11). This must have been 
between 1845 and 1855. The passage presents 
what is to me quite a new view of the American 
landscape-painting of that time. Those years 
saw the last of the paintings of Cole, some of 



the best of Durand's and the first of those of 
Church. We cannot say who were the artists 
around Inness, but surely it is not a common idea 
to believe that Cole, Durand, and Church, men 
fairly representative of the landscape-painting 
of that time, borrowed the worst in the empty 
classicism of Europe or did not believe in paint- 
ing the landscape that they saw. Of Cole some- 
thing of such an idea might prevail, but even 
he thought that he was following Nature closely 
and said so over and over again. Durand was 
a Pre-Raphaelite before the P.R.B.: Mr. Still- 
man says that he "first showed American artists 
what could be done by faithful and unaffected 
study of Nature in large studies carefully finished 
on the spot." And as to Church, his chief power 
was his wonderful eye for seeing the detail of 
Nature, and his still more remarkable hand for 
rendering what he saw. Inness, of course, often 
painted direct from Nature ; but he was not the 
only one to do so, and I should think myself, on 
the ground of Mr. Daingerfield's accounts of his 
later methods, that his greatest success was ob- 
tained when he painted out of his own head. His 
head, like Gainsborough's, was wonderfully 
stored with forms, but after his early copyings of 
Nature he very often depended entirely upon it. 

I have generally thought of Inness, not as a 
leader in any return to Nature, but as one who 
developed a new and very beautiful way of 
presenting certain aspects of Nature. His con- 
temporaries were inferior to him there. Cole 
as early as 1825 tried to paint what he saw. 
So he says himself, and I see no reason to doubt 
it, least of all that he often did not do so. He 
saw, for instance, that Nature in the summer 
was green rather than brown. His " Mount 
Washington " (1827) is as green as anything of 
Constable's, whose pictures he had never seen at 
that time. Then Durand, who did not have 
Cole's passion for the " ideal," developed a kind 
of landscape painting that was nearly akin to 
that propounded by Ruskin. Of Church it is said 
that when Cole, his master, told him to select 
a subject one morning he chose the valley of the 
Hudson River. Cole, looking at his work in the 
afternoon, set him another subject, namely, a 
mullein stalk. The story, if not true, is signifi- 
cant ; for Church is as remarkable for his accu- 
racy of detail as for his grasp of range. Now the 
great thing about Inness was that he did not do 
anything at all like any of those things, but 
something quite different inspired, Mr. Dain- 
gerfield says, by Barbizon. 

He did not aim at the particular facts, usu- 
ally of form and color, that interested most of 



44 



THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



his contemporaries, he more commonly saw in 
Nature other facts facts of light, atmosphere, 
value. What he saw in Nature is more like 
what later men have seen than what Cole, 
Durand, and Church saw. But to represent 
Inness as one of the first of those to whom truth 
to Nature, in any ordinary sense, was the main 
aim seems to me to convey a wrong idea, at least 
to the non-technical reader. 

Nor is this a minor point. It is the founda- 
tion of Inness's greatness, the essence of his 
peculiar quality, and the reason why he was 
not greater than he was. It makes clear that 
Inuess, like his predecessors and his successors, 
was limited to his own field of thought. He 
saw in Nature something very particular ; and 
to people chiefly interested in that particular 
kind of thing he is the greatest of American 
landscape painters. But he failed to see various 
other things of interest. During the first part 
of the nineteenth century the typical landscape 
painter in American opinion was Salvator Rosa ; 
afterward Theodore Rousseau took that position ; 
then Claude Monet. At the present day the 
first is commonly regarded with contempt, the 
second with indifference, the third with devotion. 
But it is a foregone conclusion that the love of 
Monet will pass, because his view of Nature is 
as limited as that of Salvator Rosa or Rousseau. 
We like his pictures better because his view of 
Nature is limited to things that we have learned 
to like. But his vogue will certainly pass. In 
like manner Inness's view of Nature appears to 
me to be limited. There was a time when his 
art seemed to me to include the most beautiful 
aspects of Nature, and from it I learned to 
admire and love much which might otherwise 
be still hidden from me. But with a wider 
acquaintance with the work of others, and of 
Nature herself, I have thought that there were 
other aspects quite as beautiful and interesting 
as those which Inness perceived. 

So one may not probably will not agree 
with Mr. Daingerfield in his view of George 
Inness. But this makes little difference in the 
value of his book. He has put into these few 
pages something of great value, namely, George 
Inness's own commentary on his own art, and 
he has been able to illustrate it by beautiful 
reproductions of typical pictures. No one will 
read the book without an increase of admiration 
for the artist. We need not put aside the work 
of others to make Inness seem great. His work 
presents some of the most beautiful aspects of 
Nature in a very beautiful way.

"Delight itself is a weak term to express the feelings 
of a naturalist who, for the first time, has wandered 
by himself in a Brazilian forest. The elegance of the 
grasses, the novelty of the parasitical plants, the beauty 
of the flowers, the glossy green of the foliage, but above 
all the general luxuriance of the vegetation, filled me 
with admiration. A most paradoxical mixture of sound 
and silence pervades the shady parts of the wood. The 
noise from the insects is so loud, that it may be heard 
even in a vessel anchored several hundred yards from 
the shore ; yet within the recesses of the forest a universal 
silence appears to reign. To a person fond of natural 
history, such a day as this brings with it a deeper pleasure 
than he can ever hope to experience again." Charles 
Darwin. 

We are gradually waking up to the fact that 
there is a fairyland to the south of us, readily 
accessible within a week. The volume of travel 
to the American tropics accordingly increases, 
taxing the capacity of vessels running to Central 
America and the West Indies. With the open- 
ing of the Panama Canal, "everybody " will visit 
the Isthmus ; and after the excitement has died 
down, it will probably remain "the thing" to 
take the tropical route to California. At the 
same time, now that modern sanitation is able 
practically to abolish malaria, yellow fever, and 
other diseases, tropical regions will gradually 
become sufficiently healthy to be colonized by 
our countrymen in much greater numbers than 
heretofore. All this will not be without its dis- 
advantages, and if it happens (as it has happened 
in places) that we are chiefly known to the na- 
tives for our vulgarity and commercial crooked- 
ness, the discovery of the tropics by the people 
of the United States will seem to the rest of the 
world a calamity. Primarily owing to the intel- 
ligence and untiring energy of a small group of 
men, we have made an excellent impression by 
our work at Panama, and this should stand as a 
model for the future, no matter if it is suggest- 
ive of State Socialism. Panama, however, illus- 
trates organization, cooperation, government; it 
does not closely touch the relation of the indi- 
vidual, as such, to his environment. The Amer- 
ican in the tropics, if he is to make the most of 
his opportunities, must cultivate at least in some 
degree the faculty of intelligent appreciation; 
something at least of the feeling so well expressed 
by Darwin in the quotation above. To do this, 
he must not be wholly ignorant, either of what 
is known, or of the vast opportunity still remain-

ing for increasing knowledge. Without being 
a professional naturalist, he may nevertheless 
read books of travel, and get an idea of the coun- 
tries he is to visit. If, in an amateur way, he 
aspires to add something to the storehouses of 
science, so much the better. Beginning thus, 
he is more than likely presently to find himself 
in possession of a delightful hobby. A lady of 
my acquaintance, during the present year, spent 
a month in Guatemala, and while there discov- 
ered a large tree with splendid red flowers, more 
than forty kinds of insects, and half a dozen 
other small animals, all wholly new to science. 
With the journey back and forth, she was absent 
from home just six weeks. 

It is not our purpose at the present time to 
enumerate the " best hundred books " on the 
American tropics. As a matter of fact, good 
books on tropical Nature are not numerous ; 
Wallace, Darwin, Spruce, and Beebe, on South 
America, the charming volume of P. H. Gosse 
on Jamaica, Belt on Nicaragua, are the ones that 
first come to mind. Belt's famous little work 
is unfortunately out of print, and may only be 
obtained with difficulty, at a fancy price. Two 
new books now before us are the immediate 
cause of this discussion. James Rod way, long 
resident in British Guiana, well known as a 
competent and enthusiastic naturalist, has en- 
larged and revised his work on the natural 
history of that country, which now comes to 
us as a volume of 326 pages, well illustrated. 
He graphically describes the life of the forest, 
where the Indian seems part of the general 
order of things, one of the animals. He explains 
how the beauty and order of nature comes out 
of the struggle for existence ; and this term, 
instead of being a vague abstraction, is made 
to stand for living realities, described in detail. 
From the account of the Indian we quote a few 
paragraphs. 

" The man of the forest is in almost perfect harmony 
with his surroundings, and if to be so is to be happy, as 
some have said, then the South American Indian must 
be one of the happiest of men. . . . Having lived iii 
the forest for ages, the Indian can hardly be looked 
upon as one of the rulers of creation, but rather as in 
perfect unison with nature. He is as much a part of the 
whole as the jaguar, the howling monkey, or the tapir. 
He does not interfere with the constitution of things 
does not clear great tracts of land builds no cities 
erects no monuments nor does he leave many more 
traces of his presence than the other inhabitants of the 
forest. . . . From one point of view he may be consid- 
ered as having attained perfection. The balance of life 
has been kept up, and, apart from outside influences, he 
does not exterminate a single animal. Nowhere per- 
haps is the fauna of such an ancient type so well pro- 



tected and so perfectly fitted to its environment, and 
nowhere can we study man as an animal so well as in 
the Guiana forest." 

Here and there, we may find reason to debate 
or dispute some of Mr. Rodway's opinions,* but 
we always admire his ability to see and to de- 
scribe. He tells us that he has studied tropical 
nature for forty years ; his book is not based on 
the hasty impressions of a visitor, it is the fruit 
of long and persistent investigation. Perhaps 
"investigation" is not quite the word to use 
here, it is too suggestive of technicalities; we 
may rather say that Mr. Rodway has made 
himself at home in the forest, has lived the life 
there, and describes what he has felt and seen. 
Thus his narrative flows and has no suggestion 
of a catalogue; there is nothing technical enough 
to frighten any educated reader, and yet it is 
clear that the author knows his subject from the 
technical side as well. 

Mr. P. R. Lowe's " A Naturalist on Desert 
Islands" is a quite different book, the author 
having neither the maturity nor the experience 
of Mr. Rodway. Nevertheless, it gives a read- 
able and interesting account of the voyages of Sir 
Frederic Johnstone and his companions among 
the islands of the Caribbean Sea. The first part 
describes Swan Islands, two small and isolated 
bits of land nearly a hundred miles north of the 
coast of Honduras. The rest of the book is de- 
voted to Blanquilla and the Hermauos Islands, 
north of Venezuela. Although the author and 
his companions made no long stay at these places, 
they were able to obtain much interesting infor- 
mation and a good series of specimens, especially 
of birds. Either the collections had not all been 
worked out at the time of writing, or Mr. Lowe 
did not wish to burden his text with too many 
dry details, so we are left uncertain as to the 
total results of the expeditions. We hear, how- 
ever, of a new bird from Blanquilla Island, and 
various additions to our knowledge of the distri- 
bution of birds and other animals. There is also 
much interesting discussion of the problems con- 
nected with island life, while the human history 
of the places visited is well described. The effect 
upon the reader will be to make him wish to ex- 
plore some of these fascinating Caribbean islands ; 
and while few have a yacht or other means at 
their command, one may hope that some, at one 
time or another, will be found to take up the 
evidently uncompleted work.

A SURVEY or ENGLISH POETRY.* 

The recent re-issue of Mr. Courthope's " His- 
tory of English Poetry," which involves, besides 
the reprinting of the last two volumes, some 
revision of the text of the earlier ones, makes it 
fitting to consider the character and value of 
this monumental work. It is the fulfilment of 
an idea which in the eighteenth century was 
dreamed of by Pope and Gray, and brought to 
measurable achievement by Thomas Warton, 
but which Mr. Courthope was the first of mod- 
ern scholars to realize the survey of the whole 
course of English poetry at the hands of a single 
man. 

Such an undertaking gives rise, first of all, 
to the query whether any one man can hope to 
accomplish such a task in accordance with the 
standards of the scholarship of our time. The 
characteristic historical work of this generation 
is of the type represented by the " Cambridge 
Modern History" and the " Cambridge History 
of English Literature," works formed by the 
combined labors of a company of scholars, no 
one of whom would have been able or willing to 
do the whole with thoroughness. One might, 
therefore, feel some misgivings concerning the 
efforts of a single scholar, whose previous studies 
have been largely confined to the modern period, 
to survey a field which has been so thoroughly 
subdivided by his contemporaries. And the 
result to some extent justifies the misgivings. 
The diverse researches of modern philology 
and literary history, in the English field, are 
only partially represented by Mr. Courthope's 
work. 

From one point of view this deficiency may 
be expressed by saying that the History has too 
few footnotes. To some readers this statement 
will appear a dreadful example of misguided 
academic pedantry. But if it is recalled that the 
History does not set out to be merely popular, 
but to attain genuine scholarliness of method 
and result, it will perhaps be admitted that, 
without abundant reference to authorities, to 
sources, to the discussion of doubtful matters, 
to incidental issues that constantly arise, queries 
will often be raised which cannot be answered 
in the complacent ipse-dixit of a smooth-flowing 
text. Two books of recent years, which added 
respectively to the glory of American and 
British scholarship, and which are far from 
being pedantic or even merely learned, may be 



*A HISTORY OF ENGLISH POETRY. By William John 
Courthope. Revised edition. In six volumes. New York :

instanced as examples of what footnotes mean: 
Professor F. B. Gummere's " The Beginnings 
of Poetry " and Professor A. C. Bradley 's 
" Shakespearean Tragedy."* They mean that at 
every point the writer has not merely set forth 
the results of individual study, but has envisaged 
the problems suggested in all directions by the 
work of previous scholars. In this regard, then, 
Mr. Courthope's work, while not wholly negli- 
gent, leaves very much to be desired. In many 
a difficult tract of his territory, the character 
of epic represented in " Beowulf," for example, 
the authorship of " Piers Plowman," the mean- 
ing of Euphuism, the authenticity of certain 
quasi-Shakespearean plays, one may trace the 
dangerous results of what from another stand- 
point might seem a really noble individualism or 
self-dependence. 

But on the other hand, if the detailed results 
of modern philology are inadequately repre- 
sented, the processes of that form of study which 
has come to be called comparative literature are 
conspicuous for their presence and effectiveness. 
In his own reading and thought Mr. Courthope 
has embraced the classical literatures as well as 
those in other modern languages, thus avoiding 
the insular standpoint from which the story of 
English literature has generally been told. Typi- 
cal results are such, chapters as those on allegory 
in Dante and in medisevaJ England (vol. i., 
chap. 6), on the origin of Poetical Wit (vol. iii., 
chap. 16), and on the blended materials of the 
poetry of Milton (vol. iii., chap. 14), chapters 
which for breadth of background it would be 
difficult to parallel in any similar work. 

A second query which naturally arises from 
the character of the undertaking is that which 
concerns the possibility of defining the bound- 
aries of "English Poetry" for such a purpose. 
Mr. Courthope started out with a conspicuously 
simple and sensible definition: "By English 
Poetry I mean metrical compositions written in 
our language." But as he proceeded he did not 
remain faithful to this. In the drama he found, 
as was to be anticipated, a troublesome problem, 
and courageously met it by including the whole 
subject of English Drama, at least for the earlier 
periods. Reaching the Elizabethan age, he 
allowed himself to include a chapter on Lyly 
and euphuistic prose, because of the undeniable 
relationship between these and poetical matters. 
For less obvious reasons, he later included a chap- 



*In the second instance, the book being composed of lec- 
tures published as delivered orally, the notes are relegated

of one or two matters by Mr. Courthope.

ter (in volume vi.) on the rise of the periodicals, 
and, still further on, a chapter 011 the Waverley 
Novels, on the ground that " a history of En- 
glish poetry can hardly exclude a consideration 
of the growth of romantic fiction." It is indeed 
pretty clear that, if poetry is viewed not as a form 
of art so much as the expression of national life 
always Mr. Courthope's leading idea its 
separation from prose literature becomes often 
difficult if not positively misleading. The 
thoughtful reader of these volumes will therefore 
almost inevitably come to the conclusion that the 
work should either have been expanded to form 
a History of English Literature, or curtailed to 
form a History of Modern English Poetry, the 
drama and other doubtful forms excluded. 

But, setting aside these perhaps ungenerous 
queries, what sort of a history is actually in 
our hand? One, in the first place, of undeniable 
and impressive unity, such as the work of a com- 
pany of scholars could never attain. This unity 
is the outcome of the central purpose of the writer, 
which is stated repeatedly and consistently main- 
tained. At the outset he tells us that his aim 
is "to treat poetry as an expression of the im- 
agination, not simply of the individual poet, 
but of the English people." And at the close his 
hope is that the completed work has enabled the 
reader to "conceive more distinctly the gradual 
and majestic growth of the British Empire out 
of the institutions of the Middle Ages." This 
method produces a genuine history, as distin- 
guished from the succession of facts, biograph- 
ical and bibliographical, which usually go under 
that name where literature is concerned. The 
normal writer of " literary history" chiefly asks 
himself: When did Smith live? What books 
did he write ? What style did he write them in ? 
Are they better or worse than the books of Jones? 
Mr. Courthope always asks: What did Smith 
say? Why did he say it? Above all, why was 
Smith ? And the answer to the second and third 
questions is always found in other people than 
Smith commonly in the Whig party or the 
English nation. 

This method, at its best profound and illumi- 
nating, sometimes gives odd results. For when 
we seek to learn not merely what but why, we 
are always in some danger of weaving illusory 
webs of explanation ; and certain of Mr. Court- 
hope's theories tempt the reader to recall the 
tour deforce of DeQuincey's in which he proved 
that the character of Greek literature was de- 
termined by the fact that the Greeks wore cot- 
ton clothing (no linen rags, no paper ; no paper, 
no books ; no books, no written style). It may 



be true that the movement of poetry from sym- 
bolism to realism was produced by the combined 
influence of encyclopaedic education, feudal insti- 
tutions, and the growth of civil order (vol. i., chap. 
xii.); but it is very difficult to prove it, and would 
be still more difficult to disprove any conflicting 
hypothesis. It may be true that Walter Scott is 
to be explained by the "happy mixture of Law 
and Liberty that enabled Scotland to play so 
leading a part in the history of the romantic 
movement," and that the character of the poetry 
of the age of Pope is due to the Whig Revolution 
of 1688; even if these things are not true, the 
assertion of them is suggestive and enlightening. 
But one rubs one's eyes a bit at the assertion 
that the formal epithets the dewy meads and 
conscious bosoms and all the rest of the neo- 
classical poetry "reflect the change from the 
feudal absolutism of the Stuarts to the Parlia- 
mentary system of the eighteenth century" (v., 
42), and is perhaps tempted to think, subse- 
quently, that Mr. Courthope believes the peace- 
ful Cumberland country and quiet waters of 
Wordsworth's childhood home were the result of 
" the general peace and order which, since the 
Revolution of 1688, had settled upon the con- 
stitution of society" (vi., 160), though all that 
he really says is that they reflected that peace 
and order. 

Another difficulty with this historical method 
is that its followers are in danger of forgetting 
that, after all, there arises every now and then 
a man who does and says things not in the least 
as a representative of national forces and move- 
ments, but because he happens to want to do 
and say them. Perhaps in the end we shall be 
forced to admit that this is an illusion that 
in the last resort no poet, however free he may 
seem, can escape the Zeitgeist. But some of the 
most interesting phenomena of literature are 
significant chiefly from their apparent indepen- 
dence. If ever there was a poet who, entering 
the firmament of lyrical expression, left on it a 
track of passionately personal utterance, that 
poet was John Donne. You may explain the 
peculiarities of his style by the church fathers 
in his Catholic home, or the decayed symbolism 
of Marino, or what you will ; the flaming, con- 
torted individuality of his work remains. Now 
if we seek for an account of this in Mr. Court- 
hope, what has he for us ? Why, we learn that 
Donne as an individual poet does not seem to 
him very important, but that " to those who see 
in poetry a mirror of the national life, . . . the 
work of Donne will always be profoundly inter- 
esting"! (iii., 168). One might as well say that

Halley's Comet was truly interesting only to 
those who had figured its orbit or analyzed its 
spectrum. 

A final difficulty with this disregard of indi- 
vidualism is the slight opportunity it gives for 
emphasizing the most characteristic phases of 
romantic art. Here Mr. Courthope, as has long 
been known, is finely consistent ; and when the 
last volume of his History drew near there was 
no little curiosity felt as to the treatment he 
would accord the romantic poets whose doctrines 
he had often so vigorously opposed. When it 
was published, he was seen to be able to discuss 
them with conspicuous fairness of tone. With 
Keats, to be sure, and his contempt for the 
eighteenth century, Mr. Courthope finds it diffi- 
cult to be patient (how inartistic, he tells us, is 
the " languid trickle " of his couplets when com- 
pared with those of Goldsmith, whom Keats 
despised !); but of Wordsworth and Shelley there 
are more than respectful accounts, and one is 
tempted to cry Bravo ! when the critic permits 
himself so to warm to the lines "To a Skylark " 
as to call them " divine." Two notes, notwith- 
standing, are always audible in Mr. Courthope's 
story of the romanticists. In the first place, it 
is inevitably what they say that interests him, 
never the mere charm of form, the ravishing 
gratuitous beauty of detail, the " mirific mo- 
ment," as Mr. Saintsbury somewhere has it, 
which for true lovers of romantic art is always 
so large a part of the sum of pleasure. In the 
second place, the doctrines of the new school of 
poetry are nowhere approved, but, on the con- 
trary, the poets are represented as succeeding 
in spite of them. As in his earlier writings, 
Mr. Courthope is inexorably set to combat the 
poetic movement inaugurated by Wordsworth 
and Coleridge, because of its aim "to exchange 
the ancient method, consisting in the ideal imi- 
tation of external objects, for an introspective 
analysis of the impressions of the individual 
mind" (vi., 192). And this teaching is further 
enforced by a new definition of poetry as " the 
art of expressing imaginative ideas universally 
existing in any free society " (vi., 444). By 
reason of this faith, the author of the History 
a classicist in an age when classicism seems 
hopelessly defeated, and a spiritual Tory in a 
time when self-confessed Tories are no more 
views despondently the present state of poetry, 
and concludes his story by expressly declining 
to continue it beyond the time of Scott, because 
the romantic movement has separated poetry 
" from the organized course of national life." 
A strange mishap this, to have so defined poetry 



that in the Victorian age it disappears from 
sight ! 

On the other hand, for the classical age, the 
"excellent and indispensable eighteenth cen- 
tury," Mr. Courthope remains our best au- 
thority one may almost say our only authority. 
For many a day accounts of our eighteenth- 
century poetry have consisted chiefly of two 
parts: the explanation of why most of it is 
unreadable, and the recognition of exceptions 
in the case of the so-called heralds of romanti- 
cism. Wherever a writer exhibited any human 
sympathy, love of beauty, or sense of the eter- 
nities, or wrote in anything except the heroic 
couplet, he was a sign of the "romantic revival." 
The rest was silence. Thanks to Mr. Courthope, 
we now have the first real account of the most 
characteristic poetry of that age, what its 
numerous half -forgotten representatives really 
said, and why. He can read and interpret, 
without contempt, without even the gently deri- 
sive humor with which Mr. Gosse, for example, 
has gracefully described them, the poems on 
cider, on sheep-raising, on the imagination, on 
morals and politics, of which in general it may 
be said that none have named them but to jeer. 
(Nay, did not Mr. Courthope himself, a year or 
two since, write an extremely interesting poem, 
reminiscent of the neo-classical manner, on the 
raising of hops and the mistakes of the Liberal 
party?) His account of the poetical purposes 
of Crabbe (vi., 365), of the development of 
"classic purity" of poetical expression (v., 359), 
of the style of Cowper (v., 357), one can hardly 
conceive as being bettered. In other words, 
where the course of English poetry does run par- 
allel with that of English thought and society, 
and can be explained by national rather than 
individual facts, our historian is not only a 
safe but an illuminating guide. 

If some emphasis has been laid, then, on de- 
fects or idiosyncrasies of method, it is because 
they seemed to be instructive, not to detract 
from the value of the whole. They result from 
the intense unity and singleness of purpose which 
at the same time give this book its power. They 
can be corrected by the intelligent reader ; and 
the History is not meant for any other. For 
some of us the continuous development of its his- 
torical method seems so suggestive and enlight- 
ening that we may well prefer it to works (like 
the Cambridge History, for example) made on 
the patchwork plan, despite the greater accur- 
acy of detail which in our time only composite 
scholarship can hope to give for so large a field.

CONTROLLING MAN'S EVOLUTION.* 



In respect of material things the progress of 
the world during the last half century has admit- 
tedly been almost incomprehensibly rapid. It 
is sometimes urged, however, that the advance 
has been only material that neither ideas nor 
ideals have even measurably kept pace. The 
validity of such an assertion is doubtful on 
many grounds. But certainly one of its neatest 
refutations is to be found in the eugenics move- 
ment. Fifty years ago the intellectual world 
was profoundly concerned in the discussion of 
whether there was such a process as organic 
evolution, and whether man was a product of 
it, through the operation of natural (as opposed 
to supernatural) causes. To-day the eugenics 
movement takes as its fundamental aim and pur- 
pose the conscious and deliberate control and 
direction of human evolution, physical, mental, 
and moral. What a change of outlook this im- 
plies! The aeroplane and the stage-coach are 
not more widely separated than are the ideas of 
eugenics from those held by the majority of edu- 
cated men regarding evolution at the time when 
the " Origin of Species " appeared. And withal, 
eugenics is being taken quite as a matter of 
course; it is "catching on" to an extraordinary 
degree with radical and conservative alike, as 
something for which the time is quite ripe. 

The leader in the study of eugenics in this 
country is Dr. C. B. Davenport, the versatile 
Director of the Carnegie Institution's Station for 
Experimental Evolution at Cold Spring Harbor, 
and his new book on "Heredity in Relation to 
Eugenics" is altogether the best introduction to 
the new science that has yet appeared. As the 
title implies, the chief stress in his treatment 
of the subject is on the side of inheritance. 
Following a brief introductory account of the 
elementary principles of heredity in general, a 
mass of material is presented to show how 
human traits are inherited. As some of this 
material is new, the book makes a real contri- 
bution to knowledge, an unusual thing, by 
the way, for a popular treatise to do even in a 
small degree. For these hitherto unpublished 
data the author draws on the Archives of the 
Eugenics Record Office. This institution, which 
has been made possible, so the reader is in-

formed, through the generosity of Mrs. E. H. 
Harriman, is collecting and preserving in a man- 
ner to insure permanency, pedigree data regard- 
ing a wide range of human characteristics and 
their inheritance. Besides this original material, 
the biological, medical, and anthropological lit- 
erature is drawn upon for cases illustrating the 
inheritance of particular traits. 

In presenting the subject, free use is made of 
pedigree charts, which add greatly to the value 
of the book for the more or less casual reader 
who is not interested in minor details. These 
charts enable one almost at a glance to grasp the 
main features of a particular case of inheritance 
of a disease, a criminal tendency, or some other 
characteristic. Data are given respecting the 
inheritance of forty-one different human char- 
acters, including such things as eye-color, hair- 
color, ability, handwriting, pauperism, crimi- 
nality, feeble-mindedness, insanity, and a series 
of different diseases which includes one or more 
representatives of nearly all the different classes 
of afflictions to which flesh is heir. Whether this 
is to be regarded as entertaining reading depends 
a good deal on one's point of view. Bob Sawyer 
would no doubt have found it entrancing. But 
whether interesting or not, the array of evidence 
cannot fail to be impressive to any thoughtful 
person. It brings home to one with really shock- 
ing force the tremendous importance of carefully 
choosing one's grandparents. Since this is not 
an altogether easy thing for the individual to do, 
society for its own good must attend to it. Here 
lies the keynote to the eugenics propaganda. 

The last quarter of the book deals with some 
general topics, of which the most important is 
the eugenic significance of migrations, in their 
bearing upon the geographical distribution of 
inheritable human traits. A fairly extensive 
bibliography and an index complete the volume, 
which taken as a whole deserves high commen- 
dation as a vigorous, forceful, and sane presen- 
tation of a subject which must be given serious 
attention by everyone interested in the future of 
his race and his nation. The book is not with- 
out small faults : it bears plenty of evidence of 
having been produced under high pressure ; and 
the biologist will find instances where doubtful 
points are optimistically dodged, and statements 
made which would scarcely stand searching tech- 
nical criticism. But these are matters of detail, 
and will be freely excused by everyone in view 
of the excellence of the work as a whole.

suffered severe loss. While not strictly a contri- 
bution to the eugenics movement, it nevertheless 
contains much material bearing directly on the 
problem with which this science is concerned. 
The standpoint from which the book is written 
is indicated in the following statement: 

" Having reached a time of life when I began to feel 
confidence that the laws of biology might often prove 
reliable guides to the understanding of puzzling situ- 
ations in life, I experienced a desire to state my views 
to my children in a manner more definite than is possi- 
ble in conversation. I am now led to publish my inter- 
pretation of biological laws in their bearing on human 
life in the hope that they may prove of some service to 
persons who have faith that an understanding of such 
laws is frequently a help to more intelligent and humane 
conduct." 

This hope cannot fail to be realized. Many per- 
sons have wished that there might be written 
just such a sane and temperate discussion of the 
bearing of biological laws on the problems of 
everyday life as this is. The first section deals 
with the animal body as a mechanism, showing 
that everything we now know of biology indi- 
cates that the functioning of the body, including 
every sort of mental activity, is determined and 
regulated by the operation of physical and 
chemical laws. If one chooses to believe in 
"vitalism," "free-will," or any form of super- 
naturalism in respect to matters spiritual, he is 
of course at liberty to do so, but he must base 
his belief on something other than scientific 
which is to say, rational grounds. The evi- 
dence in favor of fatalism, to which the author's 
view leads, is presented with quiet temperateness 
and unfailing optimism. The discussion of this 
doctrine closes with these words: 

" It teaches that each human being should have the 
best obtainable chance for self-development, and be- 
comes the enemy of social conditions which stand in the 
way of such opportunity. It teaches that an individual 
should be judged in relation to the chance he has had for 
self-improvement, and not by an arbitrary standard. 
But it does not teach that any two human beings are 
equal in potential for achievement. It expects many 
failures, but it judges them leniently. It counts on the 
emergence from time to time of human beings able to 
point out new relationships between old materials; yet 
it does not overpraise these successes. It looks hope- 
fully to the future because it sees in the human germ 
plasm a tendency to improve in the presence of reason- 
ably friendly surroundings. It is the enemy of the 
doctrine of laissez faire, believing in intelligent interfer- 
ence and regulation in all directions. And finally, the 
doctrine of scientific fatalism looks only for results ex- 
actly proportioned to the factors which determine per- 
sonality the forces inherent in the germ plasm and 
the external forces which have been brought into action 
upon these primitive materials." 

The second part of the book deals with the 
self-preservative instinct. An examination of 



the facts indicates that there can be no single 
specific method whereby longevity may be cer- 
tainly attained. The factors which tend to cur- 
tail life are multifarious, and not less so must 
be any intelligent attempt to prolong the span 
of human life. Belief in personal immortality 
is regarded as a natural form of egotism grow- 
ing out of the instinct of self-preservation. The 
author's discussion of the sex-instinct, which 
occupies the third part of the book, may be 
unreservedly commended. The final section 
discusses the relation of the fundamental in- 
stincts of self-preservation and of sex to the 
higher development of man in respect of religion 
and the fine arts. It is not difficult to show that 
a combination or fusion of these instincts has had 
much to do with such spiritual and idealistic 
activities of the human mind. An extremely 
fair and candid discussion of the vexed question 
of the education of the young in regard to 
matters of sex leads to the conclusion that such 
education is imperatively demanded, not merely 
on individualistic grounds, but for the good of 
the race. A final summarizing of the author's 
whole philosophy of life brings to a close a not- 
able book. 

Professor Kellicott's "The Social Direction 
of Human Evolution" is an expansion of a 
series of lectures on eugenics presented to a col- 
lege audience. The book stands in commend- 
able contrast to the bulk of popular writing on 
the subject. Equipped with a thorough tech- 
nical knowledge of biology, the author discusses 
the problems of race-betterment with good judg- 
ment and a keen appreciation of fundamental 
biological difficulties and opportunities. What 
has been accomplished in the study of human 
inheritance is briefly reviewed, with examples 
of pedigrees. A temperate outline is given of 
the possibilities of eugenics. Altogether, the 
book furnishes a useful and trustworthy survey 
of the eugenics movement, and what it has so 
far accomplished. The only technical point on 
which it is possibly open to criticism is in ac- 
cepting perhaps a little too unreservedly some of 
the results of the statistical school of eugenists. 
The book inevitably challenges comparison with 
that of Dr. Davenport discussed above, and, it 
must be said, suffers somewhat in the compar- 
ison. It lacks the spontaneity, and with it the 
compelling grasp of the reader's attention, 
which go with immediate personal research 
activity in the field discussed. Professor 
Kellicott's book is a compilation of the study, 
carefully and thoroughly done, but discussing 
eugenics, after all, as a somewhat academic

STERNE AS A LETTER- WHITER.* 

It seems as if the neglect which Sterne suf- 
fered for nearly a century after his death were 
being avenged upon the present generation, for 
within the last fifty years no less than seven 
considerable treatises more or less biographical 
and critical have appeared with him as their 
subject. Professor Cross's "Life and Times of 
Laurence Sterne " is a scholarly and interesting 
piece of work, written without pedantry and with 
a lively sympathy for its very lively subject. As 
a biography it has assuredly not been surpassed 
by Mr. Melville's work, now published. More- 
over, it is confined to one volume of moderate 
size, and is sold at a reasonable price. Why 
Mr. Melville or his publishers should spread 
his work over two volumes, each bulkier than 
Professor Cross's and both containing only 673 
pages in all, and then charge three times as much, 
passes comprehension. Have book-buyers sud- 
denly fallen into great wealth, that they choose 
to pay for thick paper and big type regardless of 
the matter ? Or do they want to fill their shelves 
with an imposing array of fat octavos? 

It is this very cost of the book that militates 
against its chief claim to attention. Sterne's 
letters are not cheaply and easily accessible, and 
the "Journal to Eliza " can be had only in Pro- 
fessor Cross's edition of the works. It would 
therefore be well worth while to have a "Life 
and Letters " for a moderate sum, even though 
the letters were not complete. Mr. Melville has 
given us the greater part of the letters and all 
the "Journal," and to these he subordinates 
very wisely the actual biography. He makes 
Sterne speak for himself. 

And Sterne's letters are more interesting as 
biographical material than as epistolary litera- 
ture. In his letters we have him as the philan- 
derer, who is finally smitten himself, as the 
worldly ecclesiastic, and the boon companion of 
the notorious Demoniac, John Hall-Stevenson, 
but very little of him as an author of keen insight 
or even of deep humor. The numerous objects 
of his fickle affections pass over the stage of

his life with the words of his undying devotion 
sounding in their ears, till Eliza came and stayed 
till death took him. Married, though unhappily, 
he thus writes to Mile, de Fourmantelle : 
" My dear Kitty, 

I beg you will accept of the enclosed 
Sermon, which I do not make you a present of merely 
because it was wrote by myself, but because there is a 
beautiful character in it, of a tender and compassionate 
mind in the picture given of Elijah. Road it, my dear 
Kitty, and believe me when I assure you that I see some- 
thing of the same kind and gentle disposition in your 
heart which I have painted in the Prophet's, which has 
attach'd me so much to you and your Interests that I 
shall Live and dye your affectionate and faithful 
Laurence Sterne." 

It was the same Kitty who obligingly wrote to 
Garrick at Sterne's dictation in the following 
modest fashion : 

" There are two Volumes just published here, which 
have made a great noise, and have had a tremendous 
run. ... It is the ' Life and Opinions of Tristram 
Shandy.' ... If you have not seen it, pray get it and 
read it, because it has a great character as a witty smart 
Book, and if you think so, your good word in Town will 
do the Author, I am sure, great service. His name 
is Sterne, a gentleman of great Preferment, and a Pre- 
bendary of the Church of York, and has a great char- 
acter, in these parts, as a man of Learning and Wit ; the 
graver people, however, say 't is not fit for young Ladies 
to read his Book, so perhaps you '1 think it not fit for a 
young Lady to recommend it; however the Nobility 
and Great Folks stand up mightily for it, and some say 
't is a great Book, tho' a little tawdry in some places." 

This was before Sterne really had become a great 
man, and even Kitty's services were acceptable 
towards his realizing his ambitions. And he was 
wise enough to know that a tang of naughtiness 
will help mightily to sell a book. Yet when he 
was actually charged with immorality in his book, 
see how he defends his spotless reputation: 

" But for the chaste married, and chaste unmarried 
part of the sex they must not read my book ! Heaven 
forbid the stock of chastity should be lessened by the 
' Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy ' yes, his opin- 
ions it would certainly debauch 'em. God take them 
under his protection in the fiery trial, and send us plenty 
of Duennas to watch the workings of their humours, 
till they have got safely through the whole work." 

After all, Sterne more truly expressed his intent 
in writing when he told Bishop Warburton in 
a somewhat peppery letter, " I will, however, do 
my best though laugh, my Lord, I will, and 
as loud as I can too." 

The last and greatest " affair " of Sterne's life 
was with Mrs. Draper, the Eliza of the Letters 
and the Journal. Of his relation to her he 
makes a future editor of the " Sentimental Jour- 
ney " write the following note : 

" Her name he will tell the world was Draper a 
native of India married there to a gentleman in the

India Service of that Xame -who brought her over to 
England for the recovery of her health in the year 65 
where she continued to April the year 1767. It was 
about three Months before her return to India, That our 
Author's acquaintance and hers began. Mrs. Draper 
had a thirst for knowledge was handsome genteel 
engaging and of such gentle dispositions and so 
enlightened an understanding, That Yorick (whether 
he made much Opposition is not known) from an ac- 
quaintance soon became her Admirer they caught 
fire at each other at the same time and they would 
often say, without reserve to the world, and without 
any Idea of saying wrong in it, That their affections for 
each other were unbounded. Mr. Draper dying in the 
year ***** This Lady returned to England, and 
Yorick the year after becoming a widower They were 
married and returning to one of his Livings in York- 
shire, where was a most romantic situation they lived 
and died happily and are spoke of with honour in the 
parish to this day." 

And the facts are that Sterne died the follow- 
ing year, that Mrs. Draper ran away from her 
husband six years later, and that she died in 
1778, ten years after Sterne ! Sterne knew well 
enough that his disease was incurable and that 
he could never marry Mrs. Draper, even if her 
husband were suddenly and obligingly to die, 
but it does not follow from his speaking of her 
as his second wife that all his affection was mere 
sentimental moonshine. There is a ring of sin- 
cerity, one must believe, in these words spoken 
so near the end of his fatal disease: "Thou 
shalt lye down and rise up with me about my 
bed and about my paths, and shalt see out all 
my Ways adieu adieu and remember one 
eternal truth, My dear Bramine, wch is not the 
worse, because I have told it thee a thousand 
times before That I am thine . . and thine 
only and forever." And again three months 
later he says : " And now, Eliza ! Let me talk 
to thee But what can I say, what can I 
write but the yearnings of heart wasted with 
looking and wishing for the Return Return 
Return ! my dear Eliza ! May heaven smooth the 
Way for thee safely to us, and Joy for Ever." 

It is not a pleasant picture that we get of 
Sterne in this Journal. His particulars about 
his ailments and their treatment by his physi- 
cians do not exalt him in our eyes, and make us 
wonder what exactly were his relations to his 
Eliza. Compared with Swift's Journal to Stella 
it sinks into pitiable insignificance. Swift pre- 
served the decencies in writing to Stella ; Sterne, 
improving upon his own advice to Smollett in 
the well known incident in the "Sentimental 
Journey," tells his ailments to his physician and 
then repeats to Eliza what he had said. 

If he is coarse in the Journal and elsewhere, 
he is profane in his letters to John Hall- 



Stevenson. Thus: "Remember me sometimes 
in your potations bid Panty pray for me, when 
he prays for the Holy Catholic Church pre- 
sent my compliments to Mrs. Ferguson and 
be in peace ^ and charity with all mankind 
And the blessing of God the Father, Son, and 
Holy Ghost be with you. Amen" And this 
to the author of the " Crazy Tales," as vile a 
collection of stories as were ever printed in 
English ! 

The best side of the man is seen in his affec- 
tion for his daughter Lydia. For her sake he 
would do anything, even be kind to his im- 
possible wife : " But I think, my Lydia, that thy 
mother will survive me - do not deject her 
spirits with thy apprehensiveness on my account. 
I have sent you a necklace, buckles, and the 
same to your mother. My girl cannot form a 
wish that is in the power of her father, that he 
will not gratify her in and I cannot in justice 
be less kind to thy mother." 

One is almost sorry to have read these letters. 
They seem like " Tristram " and the " Sentimen- 
tal Journey " without the humor that makes 
these works unsurpassed in their kind. Sterne 
could transmute into art thoughts and feelings 
that are perilously near the common and the 
unclean. It is not by the eccentricity of his 
style, for that would soon pass away into the 
limbo of freaks and follies, but by his surpassing 
humor and his knowledge of the human heart 
that he holds his readers at any rate his mas- 
culine readers; but in these letters we have no 
distinguished style, no real humor, no convin- 
cingly genuine feeling throughout.

continued to the end of his life, in 1910, to concern 
himself with the causes that had become of such en- 
grossing interest to him in the preceding decades. 
His work and his writings for the amelioration of the 
lot of the unfortunate are widely known and of course 
form the chief theme of Mr. Larned's carefully- 
written chapters. But the glimpses afforded of the 
more intimate and personal side of Mr. Letchworth's 
character will give the book its chief charm to many 
readers. Of Letchworth the man we read: "His 
enjoyments were of the sweeter and gentler sort. 
The lovelier sides of nature, the finer things of art, 
the generous exhibitions of humanity, appealed to 
him most. He was exceptionally fond of poetry, and, 
with a catholic taste, delighted in reading it and 
having it read to him, and carried in memory a large 
store of it, which he had begun to accumulate in his 
youth. To know him in this character, and to have 
acquaintance, at the same time, with the strenuous 
business man that he was for thirty years and the 
strong state official that he was for twenty-three 
more, vigilant, decisive, resolute, practically saga- 
cious, successful beyond the common, in both exhibi- 
tions, was to have a revelation of character that is 
exceedingly rare in its combination of qualities, and 
exceedingly fine." Commendation of Mr. Larned's 
style and workmanship would, of course, be superflu- 
ous. Illustrations, a list of Mr. Letchworth's writings, 
and an index, are duly provided. 

Chapter, on the Zt uld Seem to the Student of the

in England. gained by the division of the history 
of that art in England into two parts ecclesiastical 
and secular. It is not always readily determined to 
which class an ancient embroidery may be assigned, 
as in the case of the richly wrought palls or hearse 
cloths belonging to the old City Companies. There 
were times, furthermore, when the custom prevailed 
of converting wearing apparel into ecclesiastical 
vestments. Even in recent times religious symbols 
have been freely used in embroideries intended for 
secular use, and in the history of the development 
of needlecraft no such distinction as that above 
referred to appears. The superiority of the English 
ecclesiastical embroidery, about which much has 
been written, is universally acknowledged: that a 
like excellence was attained in the production of 
embroideries for other purposes than for the enrich- 
ment of the church and church services, might have 
been generally taken for granted. M. Jourdain, 
however, in the eleven chapters of his book on 
"English Secular Embroidery" (Button), finds 
much to contribute to our knowledge of the history 
and technique of embroidery in England from a 
study of the embroideries which were not at all 
intended for ecclesiastical enrichment, and which 
were produced in greater quantity than we have been 
wont to suppose. Aside from this interest to the 
embroiderer, these chapters throw valuable sidelights 
upon the domestic and economic life of the peoples 
of the Saxon, Tudor, and Stuart periods and of later 



times. The book is full of information regarding 
the different materials used and the technique em- 
ployed at different times, and regarding the various 
styles or fashions having their peculiar vogue at 
various periods ; and the wealth of illustration en- 
hances the value of this information to those who at 
the present day are interested in needlecraft. Of 
especial interest is the final chapter on Samplers. 
Originally these were patterns of embroidery on 
strips of linen, hence the name sampler exemplar 
or ensampler. Later they came to be used in the 
instruction of the young women of England, not 
only in needlecraft but in morals and religion, and 
even in history and geography as a number of 
map samplers still extant attest. 

There are several good biographies 
"Le'TaSurne." of William the Silent in English, but 

Mr. Jack Collings Squire, late Scholar 
of St. John's College, Cambridge, now gives us a 
"Life" (Doubleday) which makes use of material 
that Mr. Frederic Harrison and Miss Putnam, not 
to speak of Motley, were unable to take advantage 
of. His volume is thus richer by the inclusion of cer- 
tain minor details that his predecessors were ignorant 
of, and is moreover interesting from beginning to 
end. Mr. Squire's point of view is not a new one, 
except perhaps in so far as he maintains that the 
devoted and judicious leader's life was a continuous 
development, and not a series of separate and incon- 
sistent phases. Though educated into the Catholic 
Church in youth, every drop of blood in his body 
was Protestant, and it was inevitable that he should 
sooner or later come into his own religiously. Though 
a loyal subject of Philip, if Philip had given him 
the slightest hint of a chance to remain so, he was a 
man who could see far into the future; and whereas 
Motley asserts that " his treasonable thoughts " began 
with his discovery, in 1 566, that Philip was secretly 
planning to overthrew his sister's "Accord " and root 
out every vestige of liberty, Mr. Squire has been able 
to show that "treasonable thoughts," the suspicion, 
that is, that since the Netherlands were unalterably 
Protestant and Philip a tyrant whose nature was 
absolutely incapable of yielding, violent resistance 
might one day be inevitable, had been in the back- 
ground of his mind from his very early manhood. 
Mr. Squire characterizes his hero happily in the term, 
"wonderful opportunist genius," and dwells de- 
lightedly on what may well be the most striking evi- 
dence of that quality in his history. The Protestant 
majority in Antwerp, maddened by the disgraceful 
butchering of their co-religionists in a one-sided 
struggle which had occurred without the walls, were 
in imminent danger of wreaking revenge on their 
Catholic fellow-citizens. Antwerp was prevailingly 
Calvinist. William "knew and regretted the enmity 
which subsisted between the Calvinists and the Luth- 
erans. Since, however, it was there, he determined 
to make use of it ... he had conversations with the 
leading Lutherans. . . . His own notions leaning 
toward the Augsburg Confession served him well

... he persuaded the good men that, for the mo- 
ment, the cause of the Catholics was theirs. . . . The 
Catholics and the Lutherans were now united on the 
side of the authorities," and the Catholics were saved. 
It is this sort of skilful choice of the essential and the 
strikingly illustrative that makes the book both read- 
able and useful. 

Mr. Herbert Croly's faithful and 

readafte account of " Marcus Alonzo 

Hanna: His Life and Work" (Mac- 
millan) is especially commendable for its frank 
acceptance of Mr. Hanna's limitations, its freedom 
from hero-worship, its truthful presentation of the 
real Mark Hanna, successful business man and 
shrewd politician. In the following passage, for 
instance, briefly characterizing the able worker for 
his party, there is no attempt at idealization: "In 
order, consequently, to understand Mark Hanna's 
point of departure in politics we must bear in mind 
(1) that he was an industrial pioneer, and instinct- 
ively took to politics as well as business; (2) that 
in politics as in business he wanted to accomplish 
results ; (3) that politics meant to him active party 
service; (4) that successful party service meant 
the acceptance of prevailing political methods and 
abuses; and (5) finally that he was bound by the 
instinctive consistency of his nature to represent in 
politics, not merely his other dominant interest, but 
the essential harmony between the interests of busi- 
ness and those of the whole community." He was 
not, however, Mr. Croly does his best to prove to 
us, "unscrupulous, inhumanly selfish, the sweater of 
his own employees, the relentless enemy of organized 
labor, the besotted plutocrat, the incarnate dollar- 
mark," as his enemies were fond of representing him. 
The best side of the man shows itself in his attach- 
ment to Mr. McKinley. "He had in the first place 
a veritable gift for friendship. His personal rela- 
tions with other men constituted the very core and 
substance of his life. He had served Mr. McKinley, 
as he had served so many others, because of disin- 
terested personal devotion; but in the case of Mr. 
McKinley the personal devotion was heightened by 
feelings derived from another source. This partic- 
ular friendship had awakened his aspirations. His 
general disposition was such that an ideal could 
make a peculiarly strong appeal to him only when 
it was embodied in a human being. Mr. McKinley's 
finer qualities aroused in him the utmost admira- 
tion." There was a vast deal of human nature in 
Mr. Hanna, and his biography, well written and suit- 
ably illustrated, impresses that fact on the reader. 



In writing his "Short History of 
the Scottish People" (Hodder & 
Stoughton), Dr. Donald MacMillan 
has rendered a distinct service to the history of his 
native land : he has given us a readable and reason- 
ably accurate account of Scottish development, in a 
single volume of moderate compass. Except for 
sketchy compilations of the text-book type, our 



historical literature has no other treatment of this 
subject in one volume. To tell the story of ten 
troubled centuries in fewer than five hundred pages 
is a difficult undertaking; but, everything consid- 
ered, the author has achieved a signal success. The 
annals of Scotland are replete with dramatic inter- 
est; they are full of thrilling episodes, and teem 
with striking personalities. Dr. MacMillan appre- 
ciates this fact: he knows the literary values of 
certain classes of episodes and writes accordingly. 
In grouping the events about certain dominant 
personalities, he has been able to unify his work 
and to invest it with an interest that an impersonal 
story cannot have; but at the same time he fails to 
do justice to the great popular movements, which 
are, after all, the essential facts in the history of a 
"people." It would also have been well if the 
author had broken with the British habit of telling 
the story by reigns. Almost every chapter is headed 
by the name of the sovereign; but there are times 
when the sovereign is of small importance com- 
pared with certain other chiefs in the kingdom. An 
attractive feature of the narrative is the liberal 
spirit in which the author treats the long conflict 
with the southern kingdom. While truly patriotic, 
he realizes that the union has been a blessing to 
Scotchmen as well as to Englishmen. His work is 
consequently free from such superfluous outbursts 
as are sometimes found in Mr. Andrew Lang's 
history. The author practically closes his account 
with 1745; a concluding chapter carries the story 
on to 1843, but in the form of a summary only. 

A handbook " The British We . st Indies," by Mr. 
to the British Algernon E. Aspinall, is the fourth 
West Indies. volume in what is known as the " All 
Red Series" (Little, Brown & Co.) covering the 
different parts of the British Empire. The volumes 
already published deal with Canada, Australia, and 
New Zealand. As with its predecessors, this book 
on the West Indies is the work of a competent man, 
thoroughly in touch with his subject. Mr. Aspinall 
is the Honorary Secretary to the West India Commit- 
tee, and has therefore had exceptional opportunities 
for informing himself as to the political and com- 
mercial history of the West Indies. Opening with 
a chapter on the discovery of the islands, he sketches 
rapidly their history, physical features, flora and 
fauna, the social and industrial life of the people, 
religion, education, local government, railways, bank- 
ing, agriculture, and concludes with several very 
interesting chapters on the future of this important 
group of British colonies, how they may be affected 
by the opening of the Panama Canal, their relations 
with Canada and the United States, and the move- 
ment toward confederation into one strong common- 
wealth. There are obvious difficulties in the way 
of bringing into one political union such scattered 
colonies as Jamaica, the Bahamas, Trinidad, British 
Guiana, the Leeward Islands, Barbados, and British 
Honduras, not to mention Bermuda; nevertheless 
the advantages would be enormous, both from an

international and an inter-imperial point of view. 
As Mr. Aspinall points out, at the last Imperial Con- 
ference in London, New Zealand, with a population 
of 1,000,000, and Newfoundland, with a population 
of less than 250,000, took an active part in every 
discussion, while the West Indies, with a population 
of 2,000,000, were not represented at all, as they 
were not among the self-governing commonwealths. 

Index and digest What " Poole ' S Inde . x " is to the g en " 
of our periodical eral student searching the files of 
library literature, miscellaneous periodicals for matter 
on any given subject, "Library Work" successfully 
strives to be for the person interested in the maga- 
zine literature of library economy and library his- 
tory. In a large octavo of four hundred and nine 
double-column pages, the H. W. Wilson Company of 
Minneapolis has brought together " in one alphabet 
the entire contents of 'Library Work' since its 
beginning [as a quarterly] in 1905; also new ma-

Lorraine Guthrie has edited the work, assisted by 
competent helpers. An important feature of this 
index is that it is much more than a simple index: 
digests of the more noteworthy articles cited are 
generously supplied, especially in the case of foreign 
and other less-known and less easily accessible 
periodicals. Thirty-two of these periodical pub- 
lications devoted to library interests have been con- 
sulted in preparing the work, and an alphabetical 
list of them is given, showing that they represent 
the library activity of this country, England, 
Spain, Italy, Germany, Holland, Denmark, Nor- 
way, and Sweden; but France, somewhat to one's 
surprise, is unrepresented, as also is Belgium, 
two countries that have contributed in later years 
toward the advancement of library science. The 
sub-title of this useful work describes it as "a biblio- 
graphy and digest of library literature," which in 
the full sense of the words it is not, since that con- 
siderable and most important store of such literature 
to be found in book form is disregarded. The 
addition of the two words "in periodicals" to the 
sub-title would have made it conform, in genuine- 
ness and accuracy, to the character of the book it 
now imperfectly describes. 

Fishers and Gra y weather, fog, winter storms, 
fighters of and the ceaseless struggle with the 

the North Sea. elements in their wildest moods, are 
the lot of the North Sea fisherman. The reader of 
Mr. Walter Wood's "North Sea Fishers and Fight- 
ers" (Button) finds himself at once in this atmos- 
phere of "hard gray weather that breeds hard 
Englishmen " and discovers throughout the book that 
ring of genuineness which comes only from intimate 
knowledge of these turbulent waters and the hardy 
breed of men who by strenuous toil reap a rich har- 
vest from this sea and feed England's millions. Over 
twenty-two million hundred-weight of fish (largely 
from the North Sea) are landed annually in Great 
Britain, valued at over ten million pounds sterling. 



Worthy descendants of those whom the Roman poet 
characterized as " sea- wolves that live on the pillage 
of the world," the modern British sea-rover gleans 
the fertile waters of the North Sea with powerful 
machinery, reaping a profit undreamed of a few 
decades past. The author's account of the deep-sea 
trawling, of life on ships and shore, of the fishermen 
and their work, is intimate, accurate, and illuminat- 
ing. The illustrations in color and pencil by Mr. 
Frank H. Mason are both artistic and instructive, 
and the photographs also enhance the value of the 
work. The account is largely historical, and abounds 
in note and anecdote of famous captains, fights and 
fighters, wrecks, and heroes whose names add lustre 
to Britain's greatness. 

Collectors of finely-printed books 

have loB S felt the need of a conven- 
ient check-list, in a single volume, to 
the output of the various private presses established 
during the past quarter-century. This need has now 
been well met in a volume published by Mr. Philip 
Lee Warner for the Medical Society, London, and 
entitled : " The Revival of Printing : A Bibliographi- 
cal Catalogue of Works Issued by the Chief Modern 
English Presses." Detailed lists of the productions 
of ten English presses (the Daniel, Kelmscott, Vale, 
Eragny, Ashendene, Essex House, Doves, Cuala, 
Florence, and Riccardi) and one American press 
(the Merrymount) are given ; besides an account of 
the publications printed in the Cambridge type and 
Mr. Proctor's Greek type. Eighteen reproductions 
(half of these being collotype facsimiles) of the most 
notable type faces used by the presses represented add 
greatly to the interest of the work. Mr. Robert Steele 
contributes an extended introduction, outlining the 
history of printing in England and the general 
characteristics of the best modern work, with brief 
sketches of the various Presses included in the Bibli- 
ography. Along with much that is unimpeachable, 
Mr. Steele expresses several rather dogmatic opinions 
that are open to question. For example, that "the 
secret of the beautiful book was lost until William 
Morris revived the art" will seem to many a state- 
ment of doubtful accuracy. This volume is itself a 
piece of exceptionally handsome book-making, being 
printed in the Riccardi type designed by Mr. Herbert 
P. Home. The edition is limited to 350 copies. 

To each of her admirers Paris speaks 

with a vari US charm > but to n ne is

an antiquarian, since only such appreciate to the full 
that wealth of story and tradition which has overlaid 
it like the rich patina on a Roman bronze. Hence 
the fascination of a book like M. Georges Cain's 
" Byways of Paris " (Duffield). Curator of the Mus^e

so well, and his latest volume proves anew his power 
to unite erudition and literary qualities. It makes 
very interesting reading this sprightly combina- 
tion of history, antiquarianism, reminiscence, and 
actualites, and the hundred and thirty-odd illustra- 
tions, many of which are taken from old maps and 
prints, add to the vividness of its gossippy learning. 
Anecdotes of Prudhon and Talma, the Mask of 
Richelieu, the old Vaudeville Theatre, Paris seen 
from a halloon, Paris at night, Balzac's house, 
the true Butte Montmartre, the story of the fourth 
of September, the inundations, the dancing classes 
of the Opera these are among the most noteworthy 
chapters in a series of twenty cursory promenades 
through the Paris of to-day and yesterday. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



" Cadillac and Early Detroit " is the name of an at- 
tractive, appropriately-illustrated pamphlet devoted to 
the bibliography of the founder of the Queen City of 
the Straits and the years of its infant struggles with the 
surrounding wilderness. The Detroit Public Library 
issues the pamphlet, and the bibliography is based chiefly 
on the material to be found within its walls. 

Number two of the " Publications of the Newberry 
Library " consists of a descriptive list of " The Arabic 
and Turkish Manuscripts in the Newberry Library," the 
compiler being Professor Duncan Black Ma.cdona.ld, 
occupant of the chair of Semitic Languages in the 
Hartford Theological Seminary. The manuscripts 
number twenty-two, and their titles and descriptions 
fill, with generous spacing, an eighteen-page pamphlet. 

" The White Hills in Poetry " (Houghton), edited by 
Mr. Eugene R. Musgrove, is an anthology which will 
be welcome to all New Englanders, for whom the White 
Mountains enshrine so many associations endeared to 
memory. All the New England poets sang of these 
hills, and their choicest songs upon this theme are gath- 
ered together into the present volume, which has clearly 
been a labor of love to its compiler. 

" The Forester's Manual," by Mr. Ernest Thompson 
Seton, is a book prepared for the use of boy scouts. It 
gives a brief description, with illustrative cuts, of every 
forest tree at all common in the eastern part of the 
United States. The means of identification are thus sup- 
plied, as well as the facts of chief economic importance. 
The distribution of every species is shown by a shaded 
map, and this is one of the most helpful features of the 
book. Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. are the pub- 
lishers. 

The Virginia State Library has sent out the eighth 
and ninth volumes of the " Journals of the House of 
Burgesses of Virginia." These volumes cover a period 
from 1712 to 1740; the seven volumes proceeding 
extend to 1776. The printing of the Journals has been 
done in the reverse chronological order. The eighth 
volume, covering the period from 1727 to 1740, is 
based in part upon the first of the original printed 
Journals, which began only with 1732, and in part 
upon manuscript sources from the British public record 
office. Volume IX. is based entirely upon the manu- 
script journals which are found only in the British 
public office. The editor has made no change of style, 
but has followed the manuscripts exactly, mistakes and 



all, pursuing the editorial policy adopted in the begin- 
ning of the undertaking. In the introduction to each 
volume are published lists of the Burgesses for each 
assembly, an account of the sources upon which the 
present edition is based, a brief historical setting, and 
the history of each assembly by sessions. It is not 
necessary to say more than has already been said in 
commendation of the excellent work of both editor and 
printer of this series, which must prove of great value 
to the historian of American institutions. 

The series of Introductions supplied by E. P. Whipple 
to a well-known American edition of Dickens nearly 
forty years ago have now been brought together in two 
small and beautifully-printed volumes as the latest title 
in the Riverside Press Editions (Houghton Mifflin Co.). 
Mr. Arlo Bates contributes an excellent introduction 
dealing with Whipple personally as well as critically; 
and each volume contains a photogravure portrait and 
engraved vignette title-page. Devout Dickensians every- 
where will be glad to have these brilliant studies in such 
compact and handsome form. The edition to be sold 
is limited to five hundred copies. 

In the new batch of thirty-nine volumes just added 
to " Everyman's Library " (Dutton) we are especially 
glad to note the inclusion of Mr. William Canton's ex- 
quisite revelation of child-life, "W. V.: Her Book," 
with its companion pieces, " The Invisible Playmate " 
and " In Memory of W. V." Other welcome volumes 
are Mr. Bolton King's fine life of Mazzini; a new ver- 
sion, for modern readers, of " Piers Plowman," made 
by Mr. Arthur Burrell; and a collection of " Arthurian 
Tales and Chronicles" represented by Wace and Lay- 
amon, translated by Mr. Eugene Mason and edited by 
Miss Lucy A. Paton. With this new instalment, 
" Everyman's Library " rounds out a total of six hun- 
dred volumes. 

The twenty-first annual Report of the Seattle Public 
Library shows clearly that the library of our fastest- 
growing city is not itself standing still. Twenty-two 
thousand volumes have been added in the past year, 
bringing the total collection up to one hundred and fifty 
thousand; the charging system and the open-shelf ar- 
rangement have been simplified or otherwise improved ; 
the daily fine on overdue books has been reduced from 
two cents to one cent, and the deposit required from 
non-residents has been likewise diminished, being now 
two instead of five dollars. In other quiet but effective 
ways the library is striving to improve on its already 
excellent system in serving, with a minimum of red tape 
and friction, the great and growing public that enjoys 
its facilities. 

A county library in Ohio, founded eleven years ago, 
considerably in advance of the now famous California 
county library system, issues its annual report in a read- 
able pamphlet entitled "The Brumbach Library of Van 
Wert County." Especially notable in this eleventh 
annual record of progress is the largeness of result as 
compared with the smallness of outlay. At an expense 
of only seven thousand dollars (or $7,013.64, to be 
exact), the activities of the central library at Van Wert 
and of its fifteen branch stations and twelve school 
libraries have gone on for a year. It is true that the 
entire county numbers less than thirty thousand inhab- 
itants, but even so the maintenance of so good a library 
service (including purchase of new books and payment 
of all other expenses) at so small a cost to those served 
is worthy of note. The Van Wert library workers de- 
serve, of course, more generous financial support.

NOTES. 



A study of " Browning and His Century," by Miss 
Helen A. Clarke, is in preparation for autumn publica- 
tion by Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. 

The biography of George Frederick Watts, upon 
which his widow has been engaged for some time past, 
is now practically finished and will be published in the 
autumn by Messrs. Macmillan. 

Mr. Thomas Wright, author of biographies of William 
Cowper and Edward FitzGerald, is preparing for pub- 
lication an entirely new and exhaustive Life of William 
Blake, founded upon a quantity of hitherto unpublished 
material. 

Mrs. Alice Meynell is engaged upon a " Life of the 
Virgin," which will be illustrated from a large number 
of pictures in color by Mr. R. Anning Bell. It will 
be published in the autumn for the Medici Press by 
Messrs. Macmillan. 

Two new " Temple Primers " (Button) resume the 
issue of that most acceptable series of scholarly manuals 
for the general reader. They are " Our Weather," by 
Messrs. J. S. Fowler and W. Marriott, and "The 
Renaissance," by Mr. J. Basil Oldham. 

" Reminiscences of the South Seas," by the late John 
La Farge, is one of the most interesting announcements 
on Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co.'s autumn list. It 
consists of the diary kept by the artist during his resi- 
dence in Samoa and Fiji, with numerous reproductions 
from his paintings. 

" C. Q. ; or, In the Wireless House " is the title of a 
romance of the high seas by Mr. Arthur Train, which 
the Century Co. will publish in August. The same 
publishers announce for issue in the early autumn a new 
story by Mrs. Alice Hegan Rice, entitled " A Romance 
of Billy-Goat Hill." 

In "The Oregon System: The Story of Direct Leg- 
islation in Oregon," to be published immediately by 
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co., Mr. Allen H. Eaton, the 
oldest member in point of service in the Oregon Legis- 
lature, tells the story of the growth and workings of 
the system from an unbiased standpoint. 

That standard work, " The Constitutional History of 
England," by Sir Thomas Erskine May, has been repub- 
lished by Messrs. Longmans, Green & Co., under the 
editorship of Francis Holland, who has reproduced the 
two original volumes practically unchanged, and himself 
written a third, continuing the subject from 1860 to 1911. 

From a literary point of view the most noteworthy 
magazine feature of the year will consist of the Meredith 
letters, several instalments of which are to appear in 
" Scribner's," beginning with the August issue. This 
issue of " Scribner's " will also contain a sketch of 
Southern life by Mr. John Galsworthy, the first pub- 
lished result of his recent visit to this country. 

In the series of "English Readings for Schools" 
(Holt), we have these new volumes: "English Lyrics 
from Dryden to Burns," edited by Professor Morris W. 
Croll; "Selections from Huxley," edited by Professor 
C. Alphonso Smith; "Macaulay's Life of Johnson," 
edited by Professor Chester N. Greenough; and Milton's 
minor poems, edited by Professor Martin W. Sampson. 

The latest recruit to the ranks of London publishers 
is Mr. Herbert Jenkins, who for more than ten years 
was manager for Mr. John Lane. Mr. Jenkins is the 
author of a Life of George Borrow recently published 
in England and America. He is also known as a Blake 



enthusiast on original lines of research; for it was he 
who discovered the State Papers relating to the poet's 
trial for high treason, and located his grave in Bunhill 
Fields Cemetery, which in all probability will result in 
a fitting memorial being erected to Blake. Mr. Jenkins 
has also been a contributor to leading English reviews 
and magazines. 

Mr. B. W. Huebsch announces that he is preparing 
an authorized edition of the dramas by Gerhart Haupt- 
mann, under a contract with Hauptmann and the pub- 
lisher of his works in the original. The rights are for 
Great Britain and the United States, and include all the 
dramas except those for which a translation has already 
been authorized. The first volume will appear in the fall. 

Eight new volumes of the " Home University Library" 
(Holt) include several works of exceptional value. The 
most notable of them is Professor W. P. Ker's treatise 
on " Mediaeval English Literature." Among the others 
are Dr. Paul L. Haworth's " Reconstruction and Union, 
1865-1912," Mr. Logan P. Smith's "The English 
Language," and Mr. Frederick Soddy's " Matter and 
Energy." 

A carefully selected list of books dealing with the 
industrial arts, being a revision of a similar list issued 
two years ago, is published by the Detroit Public Li- 
brary in a pamphlet of eighty-six pages, one column to 
the page. The general subject is divided into nineteen 
classes, and an appendix gives a list of books for boys; 
another notes leading periodicals and transactions; and 
an author index follows. 

Recent German texts published by Messrs. D. C. 
Heath & Co. are the following: Freytag's "Das Nest 
der Zaunkonige," edited by Professors E. C. Roedder 
and C. H. Handschin; Hebbel's "Agnes Bernauer," 
edited by Professor M. Blakemore Evans; Wilden- 
bruch's " Die Rabensteinerin," edited by Professor R. 
Clyde Ford; and an anthology of " Deutscher Humor 
aus Vier Jahrhunderten," edited by Mr. Frederik Betz. 
The selections in the last-named little book are mostly 
from old sources, such as Hans Sachs and the Volks- 
biicher, although there are a few modern examples from 
such authors as Hebel and Reuter. A particularly 
satisfactory edition of Lessing's " Nathan der Weise," 
edited by Professor J. G. Robertson, comes from the 
Cambridge University Press.

LITERATURE AND THOUGHT. 

"Taking writers generally throughout the 
world, what does the literary mind contribute 
to the world's thought now ? Can you point to 
any one writer, anywhere in the world, whose 
thoughts about the world are really worth read- 
ing?" Thus questions one of the characters 
in Mr. John Masefield's "Multitude and Soli- 
tude," and, although it is not fair to ascribe to 
a novelist the random opinions expressed by his 
characters, there seems to be something of a 
direct personal element in this utterance, the 
voicing of at least a temporary mood. Another 
of the characters thus amplifies the argument: 
" I feel this about modern artists, that, with a 
few exceptions, they throw down no roots, 
either into national or private life. They care 
no more for the State, in its religious sense, 
than they care (as, say, an Elizabethan would 
have cared) for conduct. They seem to me a 
company of men without any common principle 
or joint enthusiasm, working, rather blindly and 
narrowly, at the bidding of personal idiosyncrasy, 
or some aberration of taste. A few of you, some 
of the most determined, are interested in social 
reform. The rest of you are merely photo- 
graphing what goes on for the amusement of 
those who cannot photograph." These remarks 
seem to us to point a fundamental misconception 
of a function of literature. The novelist, the 
dramatist, and the poet are the last persons in 
the world whom we should expect to " contribute 
to the world's thought." That is the business 
of the scientific investigator and the philosopher, 
not of the imaginative shaper of speech into 
enduring forms. The latter may be a propa- 
gator of thought, its clarifier and expositor, an 
extractor of the breath and finer spirit of all 
knowledge, but not an originator of new ideas. 
He is concerned with expression, and not with 
revelation, except in the sense that his form of 
statement may open the eyes to the hitherto 
unapprehended implications of some truth that 
has long been in the possession of mankind. 

To speak plainly, contributions to thought 
are among the rarest things in human expe- 
rience. It is a fertile century that can boast of 
two or three. Copernicus made one, and Adam 
Smith another, and Kant another, and Darwin 
still another ; but the Greeks did not leave very 
much for the modern world to do in this direc- 



64 



THE DIAL 



[August 1, 



tion. Refinements and elaborations and special 
applications of old established principles are our 
task, and we are amazingly active in its pursuit. 
We sometimes almost convince ourselves that we 
are on the track of something that is really new, 
and call it pragmatism, or theosophy, or social- 
ism, or give it some other pretentious name, but 
analysis always shows it to be a thing of shreds 
and patches, its basic material fetched from 
remote periods in the history of culture. The 
roaring loom of time weaves countless new in- 
tellectual patterns, but the same old fibres are 
wrought into them; and the poet fashions the 
fabrics into new living garments of divinity, but 
they drape the limbs of the same old gods. 

We frequently hear a poet, a Wordsworth or 
a Browning, for example, spoken of as a pro- 
found thinker. But what does it all mean ? 
Who can point to an original thought, a "con- 
tribution to knowledge," in either of these great 
poets ? The former has for us a serene philo- 
sophical wisdom, the product of intuition com- 
bined with ripe reflection upon human conduct, 
and the prophetic vision which does not mean, 
as the foolish fancy, the power of peering into 
the future, but is the power of seeing beneath 
the surface of things and illuminating the secret 
recesses of the mind. The latter is probably one 
of the shallowest thinkers who ever won fame as 
a poet, and his helplessness, when he confronts 
any real intellectual problem, is nothing less 
than pitiable. He champions with fervor the 
validity of passion, and blurts out an instinctive 
but unreasoning optimism. The subtle dra- 
matic power with which he makes the most 
diverse types of character express themselves 
is beyond praise, but this, while it deepens our 
insight into human nature, does not do much of 
anything to enlarge the sphere of the rational 
life. As far as the assimilation of the conquests 
of human thought is concerned, the making of 
them a part of the individual intellect, Browning 
is far inferior to Tennyson, although the latter 
is frequently disparaged, on the count of intel- 
lectual grasp, when brought into comparison 
with Browning, for the sole reason that he obeys 
the promptings of the artist, and distils from the 
raw material of thought its purest essence. 

What "contributions to knowledge" do the 
famous poets of the older world bring us? They 
may reflect the form and vitalize the spirit of an 
age, as Homer and Spenser do ; they may write 
the epic of the heroic life, as do Tasso and 
Camoens, or of the spiritual life, as do Dante and 
Milton. But how is abstract thought the gainer 
from all the tale of Troy or of the Crusades, from 



the grandiose cosmogonies of the "Divine Com- 
edy " or of " Paradise Lost " ? These men inter- 
pret the pageant of life and the conflicts of the 
soul in terms of imperishable beauty, and it is 
doing them no dishonor to deny them kinship 
with Aristotle and Kant. Was Shakespeare a 
thinker ? Only in the sense that his plum met went 
deeper than any other into human character, and 
that no human motive was too intricate for his an- 
alysis. Perhaps the only world-poet who was a 
thinker in the higher sense was Goethe, in whom 
poetic faculty and intellectual power both reached 
their highest pitch, and were so fused in the same 
personality as to work in mutual harmony. 

If anywhere in literature, we might reason- 
ably look to the f ramers of Utopias or ideal com- 
monwealths for an exhibition of original and 
constructive thought. There is much helpful 
counsel for the conduct of the State and of the 
individual life in the imagined communities of 
Plato and More, of Comenius and Campanella, 
of Hobbes and Holberg. But they give us no 
new ethics or politics, but only the old ones 
inculcated by novel examples. And so with the 
petty Utopias of the modern writers down to the 
ingenious Mr. Wells: they may make fruitful ap- 
plications of accepted moralities, but we should 
search them in vain for any fundamentally new 
idea. Those who are looking for genuine novel- 
ties in thought are most likely to find them in 
the writings of such champions of the paradox- 
ical as Messrs. Shaw and Chesterton, or such 
iconoclastic philosophers as Messrs. James and 
Bergson ; but their ways are those of perplexity, 
and their methods those of deliberate mystifica- 
tion, not to be recommended to souls in search 
of truth. A& for the writers who provide us 
from day to day with the staple of our reading, 
they will do well to leave the work of making 
"contributions to knowledge" to the scientist 
in his laboratory and the university student at 
work upon his doctoral dissertation. They still 
have all the material of accumulated human 
thought to deal with, in its infinite permutations 
and combinations ; and the setting forth of its 
incidence upon human life, in the everyday 
world, is a big enough task for any poet or novel- 
ist or dramatist that we are likely to produce. 



THE LITERARY ACTIVITIES OF A 
VERSA TILE SCOTCHMAN. 

Antisthenes, as we read in Plutarch's life of 
Pericles, when told that Ismenias was an excellent 
flute-player, replied that he could not be good for 
anything else; otherwise he would not play so 



1912.]

well on the flute. Anyone reading Andrew Lang's 
fairy tales would be tempted to conclude, unless he 
had further knowledge of the writer, that Mr. Lang 
could not amount to much in other walks of litera- 
ture, so whole-heartedly did he throw himself into 
the amusement of children with his many-colored 
series of fairy-books. And on listening to his flow 
of brilliant conversation, an unguarded stranger 
would have said to himself that so lavish a spender 
of good things in talk could not have anything left 
to put into writing. But the books that have made 
Andrew Lang famous in two hemispheres number 
almost as many as the years of that amazingly in- 
dustrious life now closed at the age of sixty-eight. 

Born at Selkirk, a short distance from Edin- 
burgh, on the last day of March, 1844, Lang pre- 
pared for the university at the Edinburgh Academy, 
proceeded thence to St. Andrews, and afterward 
rounded out his education at Oxford, studying at 
Balliol College, winning an honorary fellowship at 
Merton, and especially distinguishing himself in 
the classics. An assured income seems in his case 
to have been no bar to early and energetic endeavor 
to make for himself a name in literature. From 
the appearance of his " Ballads and Lyrics of Old 
France," in 1872, his work, both prose and verse, 
was in constant demand. Succeeding William Black 
as leader-writer to the London "Daily News," he 
acquired the knack of expressing himself with fluency 
and charm on the most varied range of subjects, 
from cricket and golf to philosophy and religion. 
In illustration of the astonishing facility he devel- 
oped as a contributor of miscellaneous articles to the 
periodicals, it is said of him that he would, when 
pressed for time, scribble his "copy " for the waiting 
printer between the courses of a dinner to which he 
had been invited. He certainly had a larger store 
of encyclopaedic learning to draw from than almost 
any other writer of his time. 

Among his favorite subjects, on which he wrote 
in masterly fashion, prominent mention must be 
made of Homer, whom he never tired of defending 
against the attacks of those critics who would per- 
suade us of the conglomerate authorship of the 
" Iliad " and " Odyssey." His book on " Homer and 
his Age" appeared only six years ago, as the ripe 
fruit of its author's Homeric studies. His transla- 
tions of the two epics, in collaboration with Profes- 
sor Butcher (on the "Odyssey") and Mr. Ernest 
Myers and Mr. Walter Leaf (on the " Iliad ") long 
ago established his reputation as a Homeric scholar. 
Another subject that fascinated him was the tragic 
fate of Mary Queen of Scots, on which he wrote a 
book, "The Mystery of Mary Stuart," in 1901. His 
work on "John Knox and the Reformation" and his 
"History of Scotland from the Roman Occupation" 
also attest his lively interest in themes near home. 
Walter Scott, too, he delighted to make the theme of 
his discourse, whether oral or written. Such books 
as his " Custom and Myth " and " Myth, Ritual, and 
Religion " show him in still another light, as a delver 
in folk-lore and an inquirer into the origin of religion. 



No more impressive testimony to Mr. Lang's ver- 
satility and industry can be found than is furnished 
by the simple list of his published works ; and even 
that list does not include the miscellaneous and 
uncollected newspaper and magazine articles that 
dropped from his pen in a continuous shower for 
many years. In his early prime the number of books 
put forth by him in a single twelvemonth was re- 
markable. For instance, in 1884 we find credited 
to his pen the following : '' Ballads and Verses Vain," 
" Rhymes a la Mode," "Princess Nobody," and "Cus- 
tom and Myth." In 1886 he published "Books and 
Bookmen," "In the Wrong Paradise," "Letters to 
Dead Authors," "The Mark of Cain," and "The 
Politics of Aristotle." At the time of his death, as 
we learn from a London news item printed only a 
few days before the tidings of his end reached us, 
he was about to undertake a "History of English 
Literature from Beowulf to Swinburne." Possibly 
some part or the greater part of this may already 
have been written; for Mr. Lang was so rapid in 
his work that little time intervened between the con- 
ception and the execution of a literary project. 

English literature cannot number Andrew Lang 
among its immortal poets or historians or romancers 
or essayists; but its roll contains few if any names 
that stand for so wide-ranging, facile, and often bril- 
liant work as made this gifted Scotchman a marvel 
and a delight to those who read him. Of late years 
his vogue has perhaps suffered some decline, for he 
seemed to be a little out of sympathy (to his credit be 
it said) with certain passing tendencies in our litera- 
ture. All the more hope, therefore, may be cherished 
of his survival as a writer of varied learning and pecu- 
liar charm. 

CASUAL COMMENT. 



MB. SHAW'S CONQUEST OF GAUL has thus far 
been considerably less complete than Caesar's, though 
that, everyone now admits, was incomplete enough. 
Really, however, it was only Paris that the redoubt- 
able G. B. S. set out to subdue ; but Paris is France, 
as has been maintained from time out of mind. It 
was with a characteristic letter to his translator, 
reproduced on yellow posters and placarded all over 
the French capital, that Mr. Shaw began his recent 
campaign. "My dear Hamon," ran this noteworthy 
pronouncement, " Paris is always the last city in the 
world to discover and accept an author or a composer 
of international reputation. London is twenty-five 
years behind the times, and Paris is ten years behind 
London. Paris is a marvellous city. But Parisians 
have not yet discovered Paris. It is not surprising, 
then, that they have not yet discovered me. In ten 
years Paris will discover me." Following this pro- 
clamation, hostilities began simultaneously on both 
banks of the river "Arms and the Man" at the 
largest theatre on the rive gauche, and "Mrs. War- 
ren's Profession " on the most literary stage that the 
other side can boast, that of the Thedtre des Arts. 
The invaded city seems to have held out manfully

against anything like unconditional surrender, 
though the Shavian plays and the Shavian philosophy 
appear to have made a decided impression, and all 
Paris - all literary and artistic and critical Paris 
was set to talking and writing about the many won- 
derful ideas thrust upon their unprepared minds. 
Possibly in the ten years so generously allowed them 
by Mr. Shaw the Parisians will either have digested 
them, or, whi<5h is more likely, abandoned the at- 
tempt. "Such plays," says one of the friendliest of 
their French critics, " require the collaboration of the 
audience, and this takes time to cultivate. He has 
against him the very novelty and profundity of his 
ideas." . . . 

THE SIFTING OF MANUSCRIPTS that goes on day 
after day and year after year among editors and 
publishers' readers presents itself to the imagination 
as a task in comparison with which the twelve labors 
of Hercules dwindle to insignificant proportions. 
The great mass of manuscripts submitted must, in 
mining phrase, assay at only a very few dollars' 
worth of precious metal to the ton ; but there is 
always the chance of finding a splendid nugget, 
and hence the need of caution. Few who have the 
handling of this mountain of written matter would 
think it wise or businesslike to follow the example 
of the famous theatrical manager who has recently 
excited the indignation of would-be playwrights by 
announcing that he will henceforth consign to the 
oblivion of the waste-basket all unsolicited manu- 
scripts thrust upon him. One can imagine the dis- 
appointments and disgusts that have led up to this 
decision ; for disappointments are not all on the 
unsuccessful writer's side. If it be true that not a 
hundredth part of the manuscripts offered for publi- 
cation actually achieve that desired end, and if the 
complaint that our busy printing-presses are turning 
out a deplorable quantity of rubbish be not ill- 
founded, what incredible degrees of unreadability 
must be attained by the worst of the ninety-nine 
rejected hundred ths of " unavailable " literary off er- 
ings! Undoubtedly too many of these manuscript- 
producers are more fired with zeal than informed 
with wisdom, are lacking in years what they so 
abundantly possess in courage and confidence. They 
desire and expect to arrive before they have fairly 
started. It is characteristic of the young writer to 
imagine himself much nearer the goal of ideal excel- 
lence than he will after he has, as a matter of fact, 
travelled a considerable distance toward that elusive 
end of all his striving. 



HlGH HOPES FOR THE FUTURE OF EDUCATION 

were of course voiced by more than one speaker at 
the late fiftieth annual convention of the National 
Education Association, in session at Chicago. The 
spectacle of a man ardently enthusiastic for and 
splendidly confident in the cause to which he has 
devoted his life is surely a refreshing and inspiring 
one. Mr. Albert E. Winship of Boston attained 
to something like the sublime in an address on the 
final day of the conference. "Why should not this 



meeting," he asked, "in its closing moments here 
highly resolve that education shall become the lead- 
ing American profession ? New times demand new 
men and new measures. The new times are surely 
here. The profession that meets the demands of 
these times will be the leading American profession, 
and education can meet these demands better than 
law, medicine, and the ministry. . . . The coast is 
clear. Education can be the leading profession 
of the country. It is the only profession that can 
devote itself exclusively to childhood and youth, to 
the making of manly men and womanly women. 
Education was the first profession. May it not be 
the greatest? It is the only learned profession 
whose leaders in scholarship are 'professors,' and 
the one man who met all the needs of all time was 
the Great Teacher." And so on, in high-hearted 
strain and with the impassioned orator's proper 
disregard of prosaic exactness in statement of facts, 
but with a magnificent conception of the educator's 
mission and a fine appeal to his hearers to show 
themselves worthy of their high calling. The in- 
spiration of such annual addresses ought to go far 
toward carrying the hearers bravely through the 
daily round, the common task, of the ensuing year. 



EMERGING FROM THE SHELTER OF ANONYMITY, 
the writers for the "Edinburgh Review" will hence- 
forth, under its new editor, Mr. Harold Cox, sign 
their names to their weighty pronouncements on the 
worth of current books and on such other questions 
of public interest as the "Edinburgh" has so long 
treated with distinguished ability, and, now and 
then, in a tone of such magisterial authority. The 
Macaulayesque style of review and the frequent use 
of the editorial "we" seemed almost to carry the 
assumption that no single pen of any single fallible 
mortal was responsible for the grave utterances 
marshalled so imposingly in the customary "Edin- 
burgh " article. The august authority of the mighty 
quarterly itself was back of every word and sentence. 
But the atmosphere now enveloping the world of 
books and writers is unfavorable to the further pros- 
perous growth of this assumption. Too many of our 
best and brightest critics and essayists write unblush- 
ingly in the first person singular, and the august 
personage behind the editorial " we " is losing those 
vague and majestic outlines that formerly inspired 
awe in the timid reader. The change of policy on 
the part of the ancient quarterly is in harmony with 
the modernity and versatility of its new editor, whose 
varied experience as member of Parliament, as 
writer on economic and political questions, and as a 
man of affairs rather than of the study and the li- 
brary, promises well for the revivifica tion of the ven- 
erable review under his management. 


DISCOVERING THE PUBLIC LIBRARY, and learning 
with surprise that it is free and for the use of the 
people, is what some persons are doing even now 
in this advanced era of enlightenment and culture. 
Hence the need of advertising itself which every 
wide-awake library has for some time recognized.

THE DIAL

The Dallas Public Library issues an attractive 
little pamphlet on "How Libraries Advertise; as 
shown by the library material exhibited as a part of 
the Display of Advertising at the Eighth Annual 
Convention of the Associated Advertising Clubs of 
America, held at Carnegie Hall of the Dallas Pub- 
lic Library, Dallas, Texas, May 19-27, 1912." In 
this matter of advertising there is an increasing num- 
ber of libraries that not only advertise themselves 
but also spread abroad the fame of their respective 
cities and agitate for all sorts of municipal improve- 
ments and reforms. For instance, as the Dallas 
pamphlet says, " St. Joseph, Mo., a city with a bold 
front, has an energetic and stentorian branch of li- 
brary publicity that makes an impression, and they 
talk right out about the things they are going to have. 
Among these are public baths, more boulevards, a 
greater St. Jo club, public playgrounds, and other 
examples of municipal attractiveness." Advertis- 
ing the helpfulness of the library to the immigrant 
is made a specialty by certain libraries that minister 
to the needs of a large alien population. The Provi- 
dence Public Library does notably good work in 
its capacity of "melting-pot," and its officials can 
tell some interesting things about the conduct and 
the growing popularity of its foreign-literature de- 
partment. Not much longer, it is to be hoped, will 
it be possible to assert with truthfulness what the 
Dallas librarian now makes bold to declare, that 
" strange as it may seem, there are a lot of folk who 
do n't realize yet that libraries are free. They think 
there is a string to it somewhere." 

WHITEWASHING BACON, as Edward FitzGerald 
expressed it, was the task to which his (FitzGerald's) 
friend Spedding devoted his best years and energies, 
when he might better, it was thought, have given the 
world something of originality and value in some 
other department of literature. Mr. Balfour has 
been again applying the whitewash brush to the 
great English philosopher and statesman in a eulo- 
gistic speech at the unveiling of the Bacon statue 
at Gray's Inn, three hundred years after Bacon's 
admission to the Inn. As a statesman, he had, the 
orator declared, a breadth of view and a strength of 
spirit that might have altered the history of his 
own country and of all Europe, had his advice been 
heeded. In his personal relations and his private 
life he was not, if we are to believe his eulogist, 
nearly so reprehensible as it has been the fashion 
to represent him. But Mr. Balfour did not feel 
moved to enlarge on this aspect of the man. More 
congenial did he find it to dwell on him as a writer 
and scholar, a historian and a philosopher, the mas- 
ter of a noble prose style, and endowed with such 
gifts that his writings may be regarded as marking 
the beginning of a new epoch. That he has of late 
been vulgarized and his name made a mockery by 
some of his too ardenjtand ill-balanced admirers, few 
thoughtful persons will dispute. A prophet and a 
seer, according to Mr. Balfour, he pointed the way 
to true scientific research, and created the atmos- 



phere in which alone it could flourish. Surely that 
is glory enough, without the ascription to him of an 
impossible authorship of works quite outside of his 
vein. . . . 

AN ALBEMARLE STREET CENTENARY of interest 
to the English-reading book world has just been 
celebrated in the quiet and dignified manner befit- 
ting the celebrants. One hundred years ago the 
publishing house of Murray, already half a century 
old and enjoying an enviable repute, took possession 
of its present quarters or, more accurately, the 
building next to its present quarters, number 50 
being now used for domiciliary purposes by Mr. 
John Murray the Fourth and his son, while 50A, 
next door, is devoted to business. The aristocrat 
of English publishers, as he is not unaptly called, 
Mr. Murray by his dignified presence and his con- 
servative business methods attracts authors who 
know the value of the Murray imprint. So wedded 
to the good old ways of doing business is the house 
of Murray that even so time-saving an appliance as 
the typewriter was late in effecting an entrance at 
No. 50A. In the drawing-room of No. 50 are to 
be seen not a few reminders of the long connection 
with famous authors enjoyed by the Murrays. To 
mention but one, there is the silver loving-cup sent a 
century ago by Lord Byron from Greece to his pub- 
lisher, and containing some hemlock seeds gathered 
in Athens by the poet, who thus inscribed the gift: 
"Hemlock gathered by me for you under the walls 
of Athens ; possibly the same from which the leaves 
that poisoned Socrates were plucked." Grimly sug- 
gestive contents for a loving-cup, surely ; but there 
seems to be no reason at present why the descend- 
ants of the John Murray who received the gift 
should take the suggestion seriously. 



A PLUCKY YOUNG AUTHOR of Kansas, a Mitchell 
County girl of spirit and determination and perse- 
verance, has achieved at least local fame by pleading 
and winning, in a court of law, her case against her 
publishers, who, if report speaks truly, seem not to 
have borne themselves with the utmost chivalry 
toward the young lady. Miss Lizzie Wooster, for 
that is the fair plaintiff's name, fired with a desire 
to improve on the school primers in general use, 
prepared one which met with the publishers' ap- 
proval and appears also, on publication, to have 
enjoyed a wide acceptance. But when she applied 
for her just share in the pecuniary proceeds of the 
venture, a cold refusal, on technical grounds, was 
the response. Filled with indignation at this in- 
justice, and laying her plans for revenge on a 
broad and deep foundation, Miss Wooster entered a 
law school, pursued the course to the end, was ad- 
mitted to the bar, and then, with a legal mastery of 
her own case in its every detail, brought suit against 
her unkind publishers, appearing in court as her 
own counsel, and procured a decision in her favor. 
Little need, now and henceforth, has she of the pro- 
tection of any Society of Authors. They do some 
things very well in Kansas.

SHAKESPEARE IN RELIEF.* 



While the patient diggers for facts continue 
to add their grains to the molehill of Shake- 
speare's biography, it is gratifying to know that 
those who prefer to climb for vision have not 
been discouraged. The names of Professors 
Bradley, Raleigh, and McCallum are alone suffi- 
cient to remind us of the advance that aesthetic 
and philosophical criticism of the dramatist has 
made in the last few years. Men like Kreyssig 
and Hudson are being steadily distanced; and 
if the newer leaders were less gifted with the 
scholar's virtue of modesty, we could almost 
imagine them ready to adopt a slogan from our 
present political campaign and boast of " catch- 
ing up with Shakespeare." Mr. Darrell Figgis, 
the young English poet, makes no boast in the 
volume which he entitles " Shakespeare : A 
Study," but he has accepted the challenge which 
lies implicit in certain late criticisms of Shake- 
speare conspicuously Mr. Bernard Shaw's 
and has come to the defense of the dramatist with 
a treatise which may reasonably make some pre- 
tensions to catching up with Coleridge. 

Mr. Figgis is not disposed to attach great 
importance to logical processes. He leans dis- 
tinctly toward divination, a quality which he 
ascribes to Fleay among biographers and denies 
to Halliwell-Phillipps. He begins by saying 
that in Shakespeare, as in Nature, we feel a 
synthesis, though we cannot think it out. One 
may hesitate to infer that Mr. Figgis believes 
himself to have actually grasped this synthesis, 
but he has made a bold and impressive attempt. 
"Synthetic" is eminently the word to describe 
his treatise. Striking, as it does, midway be- 
tween the methods of those who are concerned 
primarily with details of biography or technique, 
and those who devote themselves to analyses of 
characters and plays, it gives a vivid picture 
of a real man a man disencumbered of non- 
essentials, boldly outlined against his surround- 
ings, acting and reacting upon circumstances that 
time and again synchronized, by some happy 
dispensation, with his own mental development, 
and so fulfilling a life that for completeness of 
inward experience and outward artistic expres- 
sion remains unparallelled. It is not a book to 
begin one's study of Shakespeare with, but for 
gathering into a single fairly consistent concep- 
tion the multifarious impressions inevitably

York : Mitchell Kennerley. 



created by the myriad-minded one, it would not 
be easy to name its equal. Whether that con- 
ception be the true one is another question, not 
to be settled here. 

Following an Introduction that descants 
pleasingly upon the functional importance of 
the lavish waste in Shakespeare's work, that 
makes a tilt at the dusty delvers in " archival 
darkness " who have " obscured the fair land- 
scape of his country by chimney-stacks and fac- 
tories," and thrust him "like a wronged Deity 
into buildings and technicalities," and that 
gives Mr. Shaw, with all his perversity, credit 
for driving us back upon the vital question and 
reopening the discussion of what drama is, Mr. 
Figgis sets forth his argument in six chapters, 
dealing respectively with the dramatist's Life, 
Stage, Craft, Art, Thought, and Personality. 
The biographical chapter attempts no general 
picture of the age, but keeps close to the man 
Shakespeare, following him from theatre to 
theatre and through his more important prac- 
tical affairs with the realizing touch of a quick 
imagination. Naturally much of this matter is 
controversial or conjectural. Mr. Figgis thinks 
that in 1587 Shakespeare joined Leicester's 
company at Stratford, and by linking up the facts 
into a "clear and logical sequence" he claims 
to have virtually reconstructed the account of 
the succeeding five years of obscurity. He con- 
troverts in particular Sir Sidney Lee's account ; 
but it should be noted that Mr. Fleay long ago 
wrote : " At Stratford, in my opinion, Shake- 
speare joined them [Leicester's players] ." The 
most interesting feature of this chapter is the 
synchrony traced between outward events and 
the dramatist's maturing powers his removal, 
for instance, at just the critical moment, from 
the Theatre, " the resort of the hurly-burly ap- 
prentices," to the Globe on the Bankside, where 
a gentler audience could be counted on to appre- 
ciate subtler plays ; and the accession, also at a 
critical moment, of King James, with his gen- 
uine concern for higher dramatic art. 

The student of technique will find interesting 
matter in the chapters on " Stage" and " Craft." 
But it is not until we reach the chapters on 
"Art" and "Thought" that Mr. Figgis is 
found at his best. They are replete with sug- 
gestive and illuminating judgments, both upon 
Shakespeare himself and the nature of drama. 
For example, Shakespeare's bombast, and his 
rapid and violent metaphor, often out of char- 
acter, are defended as the dramatist's "sub- 
conscious method of striking us to emotional 
sympathy with the Action "; they are to be

judged, not by themselves, but by their service 
in procuring the total effect. The question of 
verse and prose is admirably handled. As op- 
posed to Ben Jonson's characters, whose speeches 
were written in prose and turned into verse, 

" Shakespeare's characters did not speak verse by acci- 
dent or from discipline : they were conceived as speaking 
verse. . . King Lear, Hamlet, and Macbeth, Romeo 
and Juliet, . . in prose would simply not be the people 
we now know them to be. It is a thing impossible to 
define; but it is a thing quite unmistakably real to the 
imagination. The essence of the matter lies in the con- 
ception of the thinking mind. Shakespeare conceived 
poetically or in prose, as the case may be; with the result 
that his characterization rings inevitably, in the main, 
in the language chosen. . . Fat Sir John, Dogberry and 
Verges, Sir Toby Belch, the egregious Malvolio, . . 
are born in prose, and live all their lives in that medium. 
In the case of those who have no lives to live, but only 
parts to play, the servitors, soldiers, and other such 
accessories, it is easy to understand why they should 
stand so completely in prose. As said, they have no 
lives to live, and therefore have never the opportunity 
of springing to the intensity of poetry, whatever their 
potentialities be." 

It is in consonance with this view that Lady 
Macbeth on the one hand, when deprived of her 
real self her Will by sleep and delirium, 
should lapse into disjointed, unrhythmic utter- 
ance, and that Beatrice and Benedick on the 
other hand, when Love finally comes to them, 
should be drawn up into the general plot of the 
play and " pass to poetry." Interwoven with 
this discussion is a plea for the poetic drama, 
which, it is virtually maintained, is and can be 
the only great drama. 

This, however, is still but to hover on the 
outskirts of Mr. Figgis's far-reaching inquiry. 
He closes at length with the fundamental prob- 
lem of Shakespeare's dominant thought. This 
he finds in his preoccupation, not primarily 
with men, but with the workings of Destiny ; 
the dramatist became in a high yet entirely 
earthly and human sense one of God's spies, who 
took upon him the mystery of things. And this 
preoccupation grew with his growing powers ; 
so that his characters, even as they grew to 
greater strength and richness, are seen to en- 
tangle themselves more and more inextricably in 
the meshes of fate, because the dramatist who 
sits behind them is more and more "thinking 
past men to God." Now Destiny is defined as 
" Divinity in action," and Shakespeare's mental 
progress may be traced by the position that is 
assigned to the Divinity in his succeeding plays. 
It is a position that advances steadily from that 
of a God in the machine a Divinity constantly 
intruding and controlling so as to shape things, 
after the manner of comedy or melodrama, to 



a mechanically neat conclusion to that of a 
Divinity waiting at the end of the play to botch 
things up with what patchwork he can, until 
finally the imperious strength of the characters 
drives him " off his post at the end of the five 
acts to some position in the further Beyond." 
But, be it remembered, though in the great 
tragedies the Divinity is driven by the charac- 
ters quite out of the play, it is still the Divinity 
that is dominant in Shakespeare's thought, and 
also in ours : a Divinity, too, that is no longer 
a mere deus, but the inscrutably and ineffably 
Divine. And this is the solution of the strange 
paradox that Shakespearean tragedy, although 
in it Righteousness is constantly baffled, is per- 
sistently regarded as the highest of morality. 

In the working out of this thesis, one may 
demur to some of the details. In modification, 
for instance, of the statement that in "Romeo 
and Juliet" there are no responsible beings, and 
that accidents capriciously directed from above 
determine the issues, it should be remembered 
that Romeo, after all, presumptuously takes his 
fate into his own hands. And the author needs 
to correct his surprising impression that in 
"Lear" Goneril and Regan are left alive (p. 229). 
But the thesis as a whole is well sustained, and 
is presented with a combined lucidity, strength, 
and even splendor of expression, worthy of its 
great subject. 

It is less easy to appraise the concluding chap- 
ter, which deals with Shakespeare's personality, 
and enters again upon more debatable ground. 
So admirable is the author's synthesis in its 
main outlines that it is to be wished he had not 
imperilled it by coveting perfection. In the 
endeavor to make his wheel come full circle, he 
resorts in the end to paradox, with a distinctly 
disquieting effect. Some distrust, too, is occa- 
sioned by the way in which the Sonnets are kept 
out of sight until the end of the volume, though 
the course of the argument is easily seen to be 
shaping itself toward a final proof in their nature 
and contents. Perhaps Mr. Figgis was prompted 
to this by his dramatic sense, though he could 
easily put up a logical defense. But to anyone 
sufficiently familiar with the Sonnets to detect 
what is coming, the apparent artifice tends to 
defeat its purpose, that of producing a con- 
vincing argument. Apart from all questions of 
method, one may or may not be convinced. 
However reluctant we may be to think that a 
certain dark experience in Shakespeare's rela- 
tions with a friend and a mistress not only pro- 
foundly affected his personal life, but practically 
determined his entire mental and dramatic pro-

gress, through Romeo and Falstaff to Hamlet, 
Othello, and Lear, it is undeniable that various 
threads of argument and speculation have of 
late been converging steadily toward this as to a 
focal point. It is impossible to foretell the out- 
come. Mr. Figgis has added his thread, ap- 
proaching the matter in his own way, and with 
a force and dignity that are bound to command 
respect for his argument, though it is not impos- 
sible to pick some flaws. For instance, dating 
(along with Mr. Frank Harris) the dire event 
at 1597-8, Mr. Figgis observes that "soon after 
the unfaithfulness occurred, we find Jaques." 
Perhaps it is nothing to the point to object that 
we also find Benedick and the Duke of Illyria, 
seeing that we have been carefully provided 
beforehand with the clue that it is Jaques who 
reflects Shakespeare and not these others. But 
what shall be said of this further statement, that 
" when Shakespeare's naturally reflective nature 
has carried the mischief through his whole blood 
in sheer disgust, we find Hamlet"? Five years 
for a moral cataclysm like that to breed disgust 
in outraged blood! Great indeed, then, is the 
virtue of a "naturally reflective nature." Of 
course this does not overthrow the argument, 
and Mr. Figgis leads it to a fairly effective close. 
But the chapter strikes a lower level than those 
just preceding it; and both writer and reader 
breathe more freely on the Coleridgean heights.

THE LURE OP THE FAR NORTH.* 



Six hundred years ago the Norse author of 
" The King's Mirror " answered the query, which 
ever recurs at each new sacrifice of human en- 
deavor and life claimed by the North from those 
who brave its rigors, as to the reasons impelling 
men thus to imperil their lives. It is, he says, 
the three-fold ambition of man which draws him 
thither: emulation and the desire of fame, the 
desire of knowledge, and the desire of gain. The 
history of polar exploration is indeed a striking 
manifestation of the power of the unknown over 
the mind of man, ever enticing new recruits in 
the endeavor to stretch once more the limits of 
the world and to taste the joys of discovery. 
But the largest returns to humanity are in 
ideals.

expeditions have certainly brought material advantages 
to the human race, such as rich fisheries, whaling and 
sealing, and so on; they have produced scientific results 
in the knowledge of hitherto unknown regions and con- 
ditions ; but they have given us far more than this : they 
have tempered the human will for the conquest of diffi- 
culties; they have furnished a school of manliness and 
self-conquest in the midst of the slackness of varying 
ages, and have held up noble ideals before the rising 
generation; they have fed the imagination, have given 
fairy-tales to the child, and raised the thoughts of its 
elders above their daily toil. Take arctic travel out of 
our history, and will it not be poorer? Perhaps we have 
here the greatest service it has done humanity." 

. Fantastic illusions of open polar seas, and of 
short cuts to the riches of Cathay, drew explor- 
ers again and again to essay in vain the secrets 
of the Arctic. But the idealistic motives have 
always played a large part in arctic exploration.

and deserted shore. But bit by bit the map of 
the North has been sketched, and in the end 
the Norse flag floats at the Antipodes. 

Some years age Professor Nansen promised 
his friend Dr. J. Scott Keltie of London that he 
would contribute a volume about arctic explora- 
tion to Dr. Keltic's series of books on geographi- 
cal exploration. How well this promise has been 
fulfilled may be judged by the two large volumes 
now published, in which the foundation has been 
laid for such a history. A foundation only, 
since Dr. Nansen 's treatise brings the subject 
down only to the time of John Cabot's voyages 
and the ill-fated ships of the Cortereals in 
1502, to the point in fact where the average 
reader would expect the history of arctic explo- 
ration really to begin ! And even then the au- 
thor laments the fact that " the majority of the 
voyages, and those the most important, on which 
the first knowledge was based, have left us no 
certain record." 

Ancient records, manuscripts, sagas, and the 
earliest attempts at charts of the north and the 
new world, have been assembled and passed 
under critical inspection, to winnow the wheat 
from the chaff and to trace wherever possible 
the motive forces instrumental in discovery. 
Professor Nansen was trained as a biologist, 
and won his first scientific spurs in animal mor- 
phology. The scientific method acquired in this 
and in his later work in oceanography is clearly 
seen in the thoroughness with which he has taken 
up the accumulation of materials (over 250 titles 
appear in his bibliography), and in the critical

sifting to which he has subjected his data in his 
efforts to arrive at stable fact. 

The first recorded northern voyage, about 
330 B. c., is that of Pytheas, an ancient astrono- 
mer and geographer of the Phocaean colony at 
Massalia, the first person in history to intro- 
duce astronomical measurements and to deter- 
mine latitude by the gnomon. His interest in 
astronomy led him to push his expedition north 
past Britain, the Scottish islands, and Shetland 
to the Arctic Circle, where he found the land 
of Thule. This land, the author goes to great 
length to prove, was Norway. The jealousy and 
ignorance of later writers tend to belittle the 
achievements of this, the most intrepid and capa- 
ble as well as the earliest of Arctic explorers. 
From this early voyager down through the period 
of Tacitus and Ptolemy, through the darkness, 
confusion, and uncertainty of the Middle Ages, 
to the period of the Vikings, the growth of knowl- 
edge of the North, the evolution of the Viking 
ship, and the voyages of the Norsemen, are 
traced with much archaeological detail and thor- 
oughness. 

The decay of the Greenland settlements, and 
the extinction of the connections between the 
Norse colonies and the fatherland, are traced 
to the decline of the Vikings and difficulties at 
home with the Hanseatic league. There ap- 
pears, however, to be historical evidence of voy- 
ages to Greenland as late as the early part of 
the fifteenth century. The expeditions of the 
Norwegians into the Polar Sea, and the growth 
of the whaling and sealing industry, led to great 
advances in knowledge of the North ; but royal 
monopolies of trade by southern nations laid 
their paralyzing hands upon private enterprise, 
and all that the Norsemen had learned of the 
secrets of the ice-bound seas and coasts was to a 
great extent forgotten and had to be re-learned 
at great cost. 

The author devotes an extensive chapter to 
cartography to the early maps of the North, 
the wheel maps of the Middle Ages, the works 
of the Arabs, and the compass charts of later 
centuries, giving his results not in exact repro- 
ductions of these early works but in interpreta- 
tive maps relieved of the confusing networks of 
compass lines which obscure the originals. In 
the same free manner, he presents translations 
of his sources or interpretations of their con- 
tents. His book is not, then, to be regarded as 
a collection of sources, but rather as a free and 
critical discussion of a subject wrapped in fogs 
of obscurity, approach to which by the historian 



is made doubly difficult by the conflicting cross- 
currents of evidence. 

" Through all that is uncertain, and often apparently 
fortuitous and checkered, we can discern a line, leaning 
toward the new age, that of the great discoveries, when 
we emerge from the dusk of the Middle Ages into fuller 
daylight. Of the new voyages we have, as a rule, ac- 
counts at first hand, less and less shrouded in medie- 
valism and mist. From this time the real history of 
polar exploration begins." 

Throughout antiquity the North was con- 
cealed in a twilight of legend and myth, and the 
twilight thickens into darkness at the beginning 
of the Middle Ages. Then the intermingling 
of the nations, the new trade routes, and finally 
the excursions of the Norsemen, revealed the 
White and Polar Seas. Colonies were planted 
in Iceland, Greenland, and North America; 
then the mists closed again, and the sons of the 
Vikings forgot their achievements. But En- 
gland's sailors had their earliest training in the 
Norseman's school, and even the distant Portu- 
guese received impulses from them. It is at 
this point that the real history of polar explo- 
ration begins. Impelled by two great illusions 
the Northwest and Northeast passages 
explorers for a century sought trade routes to 
the riches of the Orient, and the sea power of 
England drew vigor from these dreams. "To 
riches men have seldom attained, to the Fortu- 
nate Isles never: but through all we have won 
knowledge." 

The volumes are freely illustrated by a num- 
ber of boldly-drawn sketches from ancient maps 
and monuments, as well as by other sketches, 
including several rather sombre colored plates 
by the author. A full bibliography and an 
ample index are included.

THE SOCIAL, REVOLUTION IN ENGLAND.* 



No more radical change of policy has been 
witnessed in any country in modern times than 
that manifested in the social legislation of the 
British Parliament since 1897. Several of the 
fundamental economic, ethical, and political doc- 
trines of the nation were suddenly abandoned, 
and laws based on entirely different principles 
were enacted. But this transformation was sud- 
den only in appearance ; long preparation had

been made for it. The story of the incuba- 
tion of ideas is now told for us by a French- 
man looking on from a safe distance across the 
Channel, and by a member of Parliament who 
helped to shape public opinion and to enact the 
measures. 

M. Cazamian traces the struggle between 
traditional instinct and modern rationalism. He 
thinks that Englishmen do not act upon theory, 
but meet issues which are forced upon them by 
the needs of the hour and solve their problems 
by practical common sense. The real British 
genius is best represented by conservatives, land- 
lords, and snobs. The discussion closes with a 
note of skepticism: "Will England consent, 
will she be able, to undergo without injury the 
social and psychological transformations which 
seem to be demanded by international competi- 
tion? Will her empiricism know how to rise 
above itself, and fearlessly to enter the higher 
sphere of meditated readjustments, without los- 
ing the benefit of its blind and groping infalli- 
bility?" 

This French observer has examined the main 
facts in the development of industry, political 
philosophy and legislation during the nineteenth 
century, the industrial revolution and its 
effects, the creed of liberty and individualism, 
the teachings of Darwin, the ecclesiastical move- 
ments, the rise of trade unions, the protests of 
Carlyle and Ruskin, the development of Social- 
ism, and the recent philosophical tendencies. 

Certainly England was not without a philoso- 
phy, such as it was; and she was attached to a 
theory as with an obsession. Her statesmen 
were firmly and sincerely convinced that indi- 
vidual liberty and free competition would give 
to the world all possible health, vigor, happiness, 
and virtue. No doubt this theory fitted well 
into the assurance of the land-owners and great 
capitalists that Providence had chosen them to 
rule the vulgar crowd in mills and in Parliament. 
It was heresy to dispute this theory. Some of 
the economists assumed this creed as the founda- 
tion of their speculations, and they arranged 
tables of statistics to give it support. Herbert 
Spencer evolved a philosophy of evolution in 
the known universe which was glorified laissez 
faire. As the shadows gathered about him, and 
he dimly saw the modern world moving away 
from him, he prophesied at least temporary ruin ; 
and he believed himself. 

It would be false to assert that Great Britain 
was inferior in its humane impulses. It was 
the classic land of the poor-law and endowed 
charities. The philanthropist, John Bright, was 



one of the most powerful antagonists of the Earl 
of Shaftesbury; yet he honestly thought that 
governmental legislation would be a curse to 
the wage-earners. John Bright is a typical form 
in British life. Excellent bishops stood on the 
side of the Quaker orator, and supported his 
eloquent pleas for the slaves of other countries, 
though blind to the thralls in their own iron 
mills and agricultural laborers' cottages. 

There was abundance of literary protest. 
Mrs. Browning's "Cry of the Children," Dick- 
ens's exposure of the misery in East London, 
Thackeray's keen thrusts at snobbery, Ruskin's 
passionate protests against current notions of 
political economy, all had a part to play in 
awakening the nation. 

All these together, however, would have 
failed to destroy the ancient philosophy had 
they not been supported and their demands 
reinforced by medical and social science. It is 
true that Parliament was not stirred to definite 
action alone by morals and by blue books, 
but also by the scare which Germany gave it. 
British merchants and manufacturers found 
new competitors in their monopolized markets, 
and these competitors were guarded on the high 
seas by men-of-war built in German ports. 
Parliament sent men to Germany to discover 
what had happened, and the messengers came 
back with accounts of German chemistry, scien- 
tific politics, and technical education. Aroused 
by the primitive passion of fear, the British 
rulers of both parties were made docile enough 
to inquire of medical men and social investi- 
gators as to the facts in the situation. The 
accepted systematizers of doctrine had told 
them that the world of free competition is the 
best and most just of all possible worlds ; that 
the British constitution was infallible; that 
gentlemen were the wisest and truest friends to 
vote laws for the ignorant poor; that if govern- 
ment were confined to simple police duties the 
children would grow up to be healthy and useful 
citizens and sorrow would be no more. But 
when the rulers were humbled by foreign com- 
petition they began to listen to the recruiting 
officers, who informed them that laissez faire 
had unfitted the lads of English cities for soldier 
service ; that millions of men and women were 
in revolt against the government, and deter- 
mined to take matters into their own hands. 
Scientific investigations gave the lie to the d 
priori theories produced by ingenious specula- 
tors to justify hoary outrages against common 
rights. National neglect had not done what 
these philosophers had solemnly promised for it.

These investigations, however, were made effec- 
tive because in the mean time men had gained 
a voice and vote in Parliament who really knew 
the situation of the masses of people belonging 
to the industrial groups. 

Let us turn to the book of the member of 
Parliament, and read his description and ex- 
planation of the new movement. The author 
of " Democratic England " started with a uni- 
versity education, and a life purpose to improve 
the conditions of existence for wage-earners. 
He went to share their fortunes in East 
London, and Mansfield House Settlement be- 
came his training school. Quietly and ear- 
nestly he studied the needs of his neighbors, 
and helped to build up their institutions, 
their schools, trades unions, church, and recrea- 
tions. He won the confidence of his constitu- 
ency, and at last found himself in Parliament, 
where he has utilized his long experience and 
study for the benefit of the people. His book is 
an interpretation of the creed and aims of his 
political associates, and an argument for their 
wisdom and justice. It is a statement also of 
what will soon be practical politics in the United 
States, where the rapid development of industrial 
centres causes the same difficulties and compels 
the nation to revise its economic and legal ideas 
to conform to new demands. 

The agitators who represent the wage-earners 
do not create these urgent problems ; they merely 
make the comfortable ruling classes aware of 
them. The happy possessors of land, privilege, 
places of honor and gain and title, naturally op- 
pose resistance and prophesy all sorts of evil to 
the nation. Feudalism has still enough energy 
in Great Britain to hold the titles to 3,000,000 
acres of deer forests in Scotland as sacrosanct, 
while many millions of men have no claim to 
daily bread which might be grown on the waste 
land. In 1872 half the enclosed land of En- 
gland and Wales was monopolized by 2250 
persons. It is a little better now, and yet the 
overwhelming majority of the people of England 
possess no right to their native soil. Mr. Alden 
estimates that from 5000 to 6000 clergymen 
are appointed to their livings by the great land- 
owners; and without accusing these clergymen 
of being hypocrites, we can easily see that their 
sermons would not touch upon the iniquities of 
the land monopoly, however severe they might 
be on the subject of foot-binding in China. 

It required nearly a century to make the rul- 
ing classes believe that the State had any duty 
toward children ; under the impulse of the new 



ideas England has developed a children's code 
which does it honor. 

Mr. Alden supplies the detailed information 
which the French work omits. He analyzes 
more fully the chief measures representing re- 
cent advance toward scientific legislation for the 
welfare of the nation : the Children's Act of 
1908, the Trade Boards Act of 1909, the Un- 
employment and Sickness Insurance Acts, old 
age pensions, housing the poor, municipal owner- 
ship, and recovery of common land for the land- 
less. But in the main the books corroborate 
each other. 

CHARLES RICHMOND HENDERSON 



CALIFORNIA IN THE CIVIL WAR.* 



It is refreshing to the student now and then 
to read a book whose author has never been 
disillusioned, one whose faith in the absolute 
righteousness of his side and his party has never 
been shaken, and who is certain that all those 
who were on the other side from his heroes were 
wicked and treacherous, fit for conspicuous 
places in Dante's inferno. Such an author can 
write with certainty, with a conviction as to the 
moral values of past acts not readily to be found 
in the writings of the more skeptical historians 
of recent decades. 

Mr. Kennedy, author of the work on "The 
Contest for Calif ornia in 1861," is of the former 
class, and his book is a frank spirited eulogy of 
his hero, Colonel E. D. Baker, killed at the 
battle of Ball's Bluff in October, 1861. There 
are interesting chapters on early California his- 
tory, on social and economic conditions on "the 
Coast " during the years just preceding the Civil 
War ; and there are other valuable chapters on 
Senator Broderick, who lost his life in so tragic 
a manner, on the early life of Colonel Baker 
when he was a friend of Abraham Lincoln and 
a Member of Congress from Illinois, and on the 
efforts of shrewd Southerners like "Jim" Lane 
and William Gwin to turn over the Coast States 
to the Confederacy in 1860-61. In all of this, 
Mr. Kennedy is but clearing the ground for his 
real work the portrayal of the truly noble 
leader whose fame he intends to establish and 
vindicate; but to the historical student these 
preliminary chapters are quite as important as 
the main story. 

The contention of the book that a large party 
in California and Oregon sought to deliver that

region to the Southerners, and that the election 
of Colonel Baker to the Senate by the Oregon 
legislature in 1860 to oppose the machinations 
of Lane and Gwin was the beginning of a 
series of services which saved the region to the 
Union, is well maintained, although one is com- 
pelled to the belief that the author makes out 
as bad a situation as possible in 1861, in order 
to show how great was the work of Baker. No 
Confederate flag was ever actually unfurled in 
California, and no body of Confederate troops 
ever actually assembled in arms before any 
Pacific Coast city. How could the danger have 
been so great as it is here made to appear? 
When General Albert Sidney Johnston re- 
signed the command of the United States Army 
in California, in April, 1861, it was with very 
considerable risk that he made his way back to 
the South to take command under Jefferson 
Davis ; and Mr. Kennedy thinks that no great 
party of sympathizers followed him east only 
a few officers, some of whom were in danger of 
capture. 

The figure of Baker genial, able, and elo- 
quent ; a lawyer of the very highest standing 
before 1860, a personal friend of Lincoln and a 
Republican of sturdy mould is well portrayed, 
and the whole story is presented in a manner 
which holds the reader's attention. Despite 
some obvious limitations, this book is a decided 
contribution to the historical literature of "the 
Coast" about which so many Easterners know 
too little. WILLIAM E. DODD.

It is a novel of style, character interest, and stimu- 
lating ideas. The ideas are found chiefly in the 
speech of Massingdale, the central figure, a man of 
amazingly vital volubility of discourse. He wants 
to be an artist, but fate prompted by paternal pres- 
sure has made him a barrister. He finds an outlet 
for his social predilections by collecting weekly 
in his chambers an interesting crowd of unconven- 
tional people, who talk about everything under the 
sun from fresh points of view. Making the acquaint- 
ance of a nice girl, he is on the point of becoming 
domestic and rang6, when she throws him over be- 
cause he indiscreetly kisses an actress on a public 
thoroughfare. The act is innocent enough, in all 
conscience, and prompted by altruism rather than 
affection, but he is too proud to explain, and becomes 
the victim of his betrothed's sensitive and offended 
maidenhood. This is the turning-point, for he there- 
upon chucks the respectable life, escorts the actress 
to Paris (still in all innocence), and becomes a strug- 
gling artist in a Montmartre garret. The scene pres- 
ently shifts to an artist colony in the wine district, 
and culminates in a riot, with the siege and burning 
of a chateau, and a narrow escape for its defenders. 
The girl who has discarded him is a guest at the 
chateau, and her former lover saves her from outrage 
at the peril of his life. Matters are thus smoothed 
for a reconciliation, and the now successful painter 
gets the reward which is even more to him than his 
art. The word "joyous" in the title is particularly 
apt, for joyousness, in the serious sense, is the dom- 
inant note of the book. It is a remarkably interest- 
ing and unusually readable piece of fiction. 

Sylvanus de Bohun, who has great possessions, 
and is the head of one of the oldest families in 
England, prefers the cloistered life of a scholar 
at Cambridge to the conspicuous place in society 
which he might claim. He has been an impractical 
dreamer from his childhood, and the interests and 
ambitions of most men seem to him quite meaning- 
less. So his estates are left in the charge of agents, 
while he devotes himself to writing the " Social 
History of the Roman People," and thereby wins a 
great reputation for scholarship. Once he ventures 
forth into the larger world, and has some interesting 
if disastrous experiences. He kisses a woman, and 
" suddenly innumerable things became clear. He 
understood now why some people could listen to 
music and look at pictures. In a flash he realized 
why the third volume had failed. It was not alive. 
A machine must have written it. Half a dozen 
Latin poems came to mind: they meant something 
entirely different from what he had supposed. 
Those poets had been men like himself; they, too, 
must have experienced this extraordinary transfer- 
ence to the high mountains." The experience 
changes his outlook upon life, and leads to marriage, 
the assumption of his rights and duties as a country 
gentleman, and the old, old discovery about the 
frailty of woman when his wife deserts him one 
fine morning, accompanied by his rascally brother- 
in-law, who has been bleeding him for years. After

this, the scholar's life at Cambridge is again taken 
up, and we leave him on the eve of election as 
Master of his college. This is the outline of the 
story told us by Mr. Ralph Straus in " The Prison 
Without a Wall." It is a richly human and whim- 
sically humorous story of the most delightful inter- 
est, reminding us in many ways of the best work 
of Mr. W. J. Locke, and inviting quite as close an 
attention to its details. It is a work in which the 
characters are all real and the happenings are all 
significant. 

Mr. A. E. W. Mason is an expert craftsman, and 
we open '' The Turnstile " with reasonable assurance 
of entertainment. Our expectations are fully justi- 
fied until about half way through the book, when 
the romantic material upon which the earlier chap- 
ters are based gives way to a dull and complicated 
account of a political struggle in England, having 
for its substance a hotly contested election and a 
parliamentary struggle. The hero is a successful 
Antarctic explorer who seeks and wins political 
advancement. The heroine is a girl of English 
extraction, who has spent her early life upon an 
Argentine estancia, adopted by its English owners 
from a foundling's home in Buenos Ayres. Deserted 
by her worthless father, she had when an infant 
been deposited in the turnstile of this institution 
whence the title of the novel. The reappearance 
of the disreputable father, threatening to make 
trouble, decides her adoptive parents to return with 
her to England, and thus are we brought to the 
second stage of the narrative. Her marriage to 
Captain Ranes is a disappointment, for she has 
idealized him in his character as an explorer, and 
he turns out to be a politician of the time-serving and 
opportunist type. Her ideal is in a measure restored, 
when, at the end, the call of the pole decides him to 
give up politics, and reengage upon the quest which 
has all the time been his sub-conscious ambition. 

Mr. John Masefield, who is one of the most vital 
and serious of the younger English writers, has 
taught us to expect something unusual whenever he 
gives birth to a book, be it play, poem, or novel. 
He has a curiously inquiring and reflective mind, 
engaged usually in contemplation of the most serious 
problems of life and character, and its output has 
compelling significance, whatever the theme of its 
preoccupation. His " Multitude and Solitude " deals 
with the sleeping-sickness, that scourge of the African 
wilderness, and it affords him material for a grim 
and intensely vivid picture of life (and death) in an 
African village. The hero is a London man of let- 
ters, too conscientious in his art to win popular 
success, whose life is darkened by a shipwreck in the 
Irish Channel, which is fatal to the woman whom 
he loves and upon whom all his hopes are built. 
He becomes possessed of a commanding impulse to 
cut away from literature and do something which 
may contribute more directly to human service. 
His attention is accidentally called to the subject of 
sleeping-sickness, and he prevails upon a young 
scientist of his acquaintance to accept him as a 



fellow-worker, and to take him to Africa upon his 
next expedition. The book is half-finished when 
this point is reached ; the remaining half takes us to 
the scene of his new labors, and has much to do with 
cultures, and media, and seras, and trypanosomes. 
Technically, the matter is thoroughly worked up. 
The two men are robbed and deserted in the jungle 
by their native keepers, and are left in a stricken 
village deprived of their most essential specific 
against disease. They both nearly succumb to the 
terrible ailment which they are engaged in fighting, 
but are saved by discovering the secret of the serum 
which will cure it. The story is told with a force 
and insight which remind us strongly of the work 
done by Mr. Conrad in this tropical field. 

Mr. Rider Haggard's " Red Eve " represents a re- 
version to the hopelessly unreal ultra-romantic type 
of historical fiction cultivated by the imitators of 
Scott. It is one of the misfortunes of genius that it 
sets a shining example for the emulation of third-rate 
followers in its footsteps, and the atrocities that have 
been committed in the name of Sir Walter are almost 
enough to make one wish that the great romancer 
had never lived. Mr. Haggard's romance is of En- 
gland in the days of the French wars and the Black 
Death. It takes us from the Southern counties to 
the field of Crecy, and thence to Venice and Avignon. 
The hero, whose affianced bride is tricked into a 
sham marriage by a French knight who is a black- 
hearted villain, pursues his enemy through Europe 
to the papal court, and finally wreaks vengeance upon 
him. Mr. Haggard's predilection for the uncanny 
is illustrated by the superhuman figure personifying 
Death, who comes from far Cathay bearing with him 
the seeds of the pestilence which he scatters over 
the Western world, and intervening at critical junc- 
tures in the fortunes of the lovers. It all attempts 
to be very impressive, and signally misses its aim. 

The story of Martin Luther and the launching of 
the Reformation has been made into a very accept- 
able historical novel, entitled " The Friar of Witten- 
berg," by Mr. William Stearns Davis. The narrative 
is fully documented, and keeps close to historical fact. 
For a reader whose knowledge of the subject has been 
based upon boyhood reading of d'Aubigne*, which 
knowledge has grown somewhat hazy with the lapse 
of years, it serves to freshen the familiar facts, and 
give them renewed vitality. They are all here 
Tetzel and his indulgences, the nailing up of the 
theses, the controversy with Eck, the Diet of Worms, 
and the Wartburg. We are also given a vivid picture 
of Roman life, its sophisticated society, its pseudo- 
classical culture, and its Renaissance morals. This 
is needed to give point to the German revolt, and 
to enlist the fullest sympathy in behalf of the reform 
movement. The private interest of the story centres 
about a nobleman half-German, half-Italian 
whose early nurture has been all Italian, but who 
is driven forth to make a home upon his ancestral 
estates in the Harz country. Here he comes under 
the spell of Luther, is attracted to his cause by the 
Tetzel affair, and becomes his ardent champion in

the events which follow. A fair German maiden 
becomes the object of his adoration, and his passion 
for her persists after she has been persuaded to take 
the vows of the religious life. The breaking up of 
the old order sets her free, and she is in the end 
united to her lover. But the private interest, al- 
though well sustained, is throughout subordinated to 
the interest of the great religious and political issues 
that are at stake, and Luther fills a larger part in 
the reader's consciousness than the Graf von Regen- 
stein. Some of the scenes notably the one at 
Worms supported as they are by the historical 
record of things said and done, are very impressive, 
as is also the picture of the decay of Christianity in 
its ancient seat. We have often thought, during our 
reading, of the historical novels of Mr. Winston 
Churchill, and the author of "The Crisis," had he 
taken up the tale of the Reformation, would have 
produced much the same sort of a book. There is 
the same skilful weaving of a private plot with affairs 
of public import, the same effective use of salient 
historical episodes, the same wide knowledge of the 
period concerned. There is also the same lack of 
finish in the detail and the same rather commonplace 
style. The matter of the work is so big that the man- 
ner can do without overmuch of artistic elaboration. 
The author's attitude toward the controversial mat- 
ter involved is, of course, strongly Protestant, and 
therefore biassed as compared with that of the strictly 
dispassionate student of history, who must needs take 
into account, in judging the Reformation, of its two 
centuries' legacy of religious warfare, no less than 
of its immediate provocations and defences. 

Another historical novel of marked excellence is 
"The Shadow of Power," by Mr. Paul Bertram. 
It has for its theme the attempt to force the Nether- 
lands into subjection to the Spanish yoke under 
Philip II. Neither the Duke of Alva, leader of the 
persecution, nor the spider-king, weaving his webs 
in the seclusion of the Escorial, appears upon the 
scene, but we are all the time conscious of their 
sinister presence somewhere in the background. 
The Prince of Orange is the only important histor- 
ical character figuring in the narrative, appearing 
at the time when the hero transfers his allegiance 
to the Dutch cause. This hero is a noble Spaniard, 
sent to govern the town of Geertruydenberg; and 
he makes his entry just in time to rescue a damsel, 
bound to the stake, and about to be burned on a 
charge of witchcraft. It is a perilous act, for it 
brings him into disfavor with court and clergy, and 
in its ultimate consequence, leads to his deposition. 
He has in the meanwhile, married the daughter of 
a wealthy Dutch burgher, but it has been a con- 
strained union on her part, and it does not bring 
him her love. When the crisis comes in his fortunes, 
he is unable to rescue her, because she suspects him 
of seeking to betray her and her father as Protestants. 
Thus she passes out of his life and of the story when 
he joins forces with William the Silent. The woman 
whom he has saved from the flames remains for the 
author's use in making the needed romantic settle- 



ment of the plot. In a very general way, this book 
resembles "The Friar of Wittenberg," both in the 
fact that it deals with the period of religious perse- 
cutions in Europe, and in the further fact that the 
hero turns his back upon the cause with which he 
has been allied by race and circumstance. He be- 
comes a valiant fighter for Dutch freedom, and in 
the end wins the woman whom he loves. He is a 
strong figure, and a fine opportunity for psycholog- 
ical study is offered by the gradual alienation of his 
sympathies from the Spanish side to that of the em- 
battled Dutchmen. He becomes technically a traitor, 
but he carries with him our respect and admiration. 
This is not as partisan a story as is usually written 
upon the theme which the author has chosen. He 
is as unsparing of Protestant as of Catholic bigotry, 
and is not blind to the faults of the people whose 
champion he becomes. His style is very good 
almost distinguished and the mastery of his his- 
torical material is thorough. Although there are 
considerable elements of introspection and analysis 
in the book, the action is on the whole swift and 
dramatic, and the plot is of pronounced and exciting 
interest. It is so much more than the ordinary tale 
of intrigue and adventure that it makes a strong ap- 
peal to the intellectual interests of the reader, while 
at the same time gratifying his artistic sense. 

The theme of the disdainful maiden, who scorns 
the hero who has rescued her from her plight, and 
withholds for long years the reward that is roman- 
tically his due, meets us once more in Mr. Frederick 
Palmer's " Over the Pass." The agony is rather over- 
done, for there is no reason why the heroine should 
have been so stand-offish when she must have known 
in her heart that she was destined to make a full 
surrender. It all happens in Arizona, where Jasper 
Ewold, disgusted with the ways of civilization, has 
taken refuge, and becomes the founder of a town of 
which he is the recognized leader and patriarch. His 
daughter Mary is the heroine, and her rescuer is 
Jack Wingfield, once a "lunger," but now in vigorous 
health, who saves her from the unwelcome attentions 
of the "bad man " of the town. Jack, nothing dis- 
couraged by the maiden's coldness, determines to 
become a rancher, and sets himself to the cultivation 
of alfalfa and such truck. But he is called to the 
East, where his father, the owner of a large depart- 
ment store and many times a millionaire, wants him 
in his business, now that he is restored to health. 
He makes a valiant effort to adapt himself to the 
new life, but Arizona calls to him, and for her sake 
which is a euphemistic way of saying for Mary's 
sake he renounces position and fortune for the 
ranch. In an exciting episode he rounds up the 
" bad man " and his pals, and eliminates them from 
the situation. After that, it is easy work to placate 
the father who has borne a grudge against his 
family and bring the girl to her senses. It is a 
blithe story, told with much animation and whim- 
sical humor.

peal to the romantic imagination, and it is surpris-

ing to find how interesting a novel has heen written 
about it by Messrs. Kennedy and Noble. The hero, 
a young man with the prosaic name of Smith, is 
engaged in the business, and is enthusiastically 
devoted to his occupation. To him the work of 
underwriting is rich in dramatic human interest, 
besides leading into the most delightful by-ways of 
scholarship. The Conservative Company of which 
he is an officer is attacked by unscrupulous rivals 
and undermined by treachery upon the part of its 
own vice-president. Its affairs are in a desperate 
condition, when Smith is given charge, and energeti- 
cally sets things to rights. The final blow is dealt 
the enemy by fate, when a disastrous conflagration 
sweeps through the business heart of Boston, creat- 
ing liabilities which force the rival organization to 
retire from the field. Smith finds an ally and sym- 
pathizer in an attractive young woman who wants 
to learn about the business, and applies to him for 
information. Under his tutelage she acquires (and 
incidentally the reader) a surprising amount of 
technical knowledge about agencies, and separation 
rules, and other matters, which are plainly set forth 
from a knowledge of the subject which is both 
intimate and intelligent. "White Ashes" is the 
appropriate title of this exceptionally clever and 
well-written piece of fiction. 

The author of "The Inner Shrine" and "The 
Wild Olive" has given us, in "The Street Called 
Straight," a third novel of ingeniously contrived 
plot, incisive characterization, and sustained interest. 
The interest is essentially psychological, and the 
situation may be thus outlined: A Boston girl of 
high social standing and patrician instincts has be- 
come engaged to an English army officer who has a 
record for heroic achievement and the most brilliant 
prospects of advancement. The wedding is immi- 
nent, awaiting only his arrival in Boston, when it 
transpires that the girl's father has been an em- 
bezzler of trust funds to the amount of half a million, 
and that his exposure and disgrace can no longer 
be averted. Then comes the intervention of a 
Bostonian whose suit the girl once rejected, and who 
has since "cleaned up" half a million by specu- 
lating in copper mines. He learns of her predica- 
ment, and, asking no reward, quixotically comes to 
the rescue with his half million. At first, the offer 
is declined by both father and daughter, but reflec- 
tion causes them to accept it after some days of 
irresolution. Then the Englishman arrives, is ap- 
prised of the exact situation, refuses the girl's offer 
to release him and offers to assume the burden by the 
sacrifice of his own property. This the girl refuses, 
preferring to become beholden to the American, in 
the disinterestedness of whose motive she has come 
to have faith. A protracted deadlock follows, he 
refusing to accept happiness at the cost of a stranger, 
she refusing to accept him at the cost of his own 
financial ruin and clouded prospects. Then the 
American has a brilliant idea. The girl has a 
wealthy aunt, an expatriate and the widow of a 
French Marquis, and to her the American appeals, 



stating all the facts, and urging her to assume the 
obligation. She hastens to America, makes the offer, 
and the path to the girl's marriage seems to be 
cleared. Neither she nor the Englishman can urge 
any valid objection to aid that comes from her own 
family. Here is where the psychological situation 
becomes intense, for when this point is reached, the 
extraordinary generosity and self-effacement of the 
American have made such an impression on both of 
them, that she has come to regard him in a more than 
friendly way, and he finds himself incapable of 
thwarting the happiness of the man who has shown 
himself capable of such devotion. He would feel 
himself under a heavier burden of obligation than 
before, when it is a merely a question of accepting 
money, and his conscience finds it intolerable. His 
renunciation follows, after a struggle, and the way is 
cleared for the girl's union with the man who had not 
dared to dream of such an outcome. The workings 
of these three people's minds, in the successive 
stages of this complication, is analyzed with masterly 
insight, and therein lies the strength of the work. 
That the Englishman may not go entirely unre- 
warded, he is given a sort of consolation prize in 
the rather colorless woman who is one of the minor 
figures in the narrative. This is anything but con- 
vincing, and noticeably weakens the story at its close. 
Mr. Randall Parrish always tells a good story, 
although he has no gifts of style or characterization 
to speak of. His "Molly McDonald" is a tale of 
1868 in the West, when the Indian uprisings en- 
gaged the attention of the United States forces under 
Sheridan and Custer. The hero is of the type dear 
to the romantic heart of youth, who accomplishes 
great deeds of daring, and rescues the heroine from 
all sorts of perils. He is an enlisted soldier, and 
had previously been an officer in the Confederate 
army. He is under a cloud, owing to the treachery 
of a former friend, and he gets revenge upon his 
enemy at the same time that the evidence turns up 
that is needed to clear his name. He gets the girl, 
as a matter of course.

Beesley, one of the survivors and a person well quali- 
fied to treat the theme with accuracy and in minute

but it dwells understandingly and at length on the 
lessons taught by the catastrophe, and makes an intel- 
ligent attempt to point out the preventive measures 
that should be adopted in the future by the steam- 
ship companies. Mr. Beesley is a young English- 
man, a Cambridge scholar, and has been a teacher 
of physics, as his narrative shows ; so that his powers 
of observation and habit of scientific inference are 
precisely those required in one attempting a faithful 
account of this memorable shipwreck. The great 
size and many decks of the Titanic, the exceeding 
slightness of the shock of collision with the iceberg, 
the prevalent belief in the unsinkability of the mon- 
ster vessel, and the comparative slowness of its actual 
sinking, these were important factors in preventing 
panic or confusion among the passengers. Tales of 
pistol-firing, of suicide on the part of officers, of 
melodramatic exhortations from captain to crew to 
"be British," and other newspaper fabrications, are 
pronounced false by the calmly observant author. His 
own rescue resulted from a very matter-of-course and 
all but inevitable chain of events, and with a rather 
remarkable unawareness on his part that any loss of 
life whatever was threatened. In this one particular 
in failing to appreciate the inadequacy of the ship's 
life-saving equipment he falls below one's concep- 
tion of his observing powers. But of course no ex- 
pectation of disaster had been entertained by him. 
Of his narrative in general it is safe to say that no 
single survivor could have furnished a better or more 
trustworthy history of the stupendous event; but it 
would be strange if some few occurrences that went 
to make up the whole catastrophe had not been inad- 
vertently slighted or distorted, minimized or exag- 
gerated by him. What one observant and careful 
narrator could do, however, he has admirably done.

Expert advice " How to Plan a Library Building 
about library for Library Work " comes from the 

architecture. p en o f one w h o to fa e infectious 
enthusiast of an amateur joins the knowledge and 
experience of the professional library worker. Mr. 
Charles C. Soule has been an active member of the 
American Library Association almost from its foun- 
dation, was its vice-president in 1890, a member of 
its Publishing Board for eight years, of its Council 
for two terms of three and five years, a trustee of 
its Endowment Fund for twelve years, and has been 
a member of the Institute since its formation. 
Eleven years of service as trustee of the Brookline 
Public Library are also to be placed to his credit. 
He has made a careful study of library architecture, 
especially from the inside, from the viewpoint of 
the working librarian, and he naturally and rightly 
insists on the primary importance of utility. His 
book, which shrinks not from handling the prosaic 
details of plumbing, drains, sewers, fire-buckets, 
vacuum cleaners, and so on, is divided into five main 
divisions, with many sub-sections. The Introduction 
touches on the history and literature and main out- 



lines of the general theme ; then comes a fuller treat- 
ment of "Principles"; after that a section devoted 
to "Personel"; next a consideration of "Features"; 
and finally a four-part discussion of " Departments 
and Rooms." An appendix containing "Concrete 
Examples" and other useful matter follows, and 
an index completes the volume. The author takes 
extraordinary pains to fortify every position with 
corroborative opinions from other writers. After 
stating in conclusive terms the obvious desirability 
of consulting an expert librarian before planning 
one's library building, he hardly needed to quote, 
with chapter and verse, an imposing array of au- 
thorities ; but perhaps the point cannot be too 
strongly emphasized. His disapproval of the com- 
petition method of securing architectural plans 
seems a bit excessive. Open competition in compli- 
ance with expert specifications, prepared beforehand 
in detail, sometimes produces results of value in the 
way of originality and novelty that cannot be bar- 
gamed for from a hired architect of even the highest 
standing. The author and his publishers, the Boston 
Book Company, invite a free expression of opinion 
as to the desirability of issuing a supplementary 
volume of plates. If enough requests for such a 
volume are received, it will be published. Also any 
other criticisms or suggestions, of a constructive 
nature, are solicited from the public. So well- 
considered and well-executed a treatise as Mr. 
Soule's can hardly be much improved upon except 
by the addition of illustrative plates. 



Further Those who are interested (and who 

f noted IS not ?) m tne personal peculiarities 

journalist. and the informal conversation of the 

famous, will greatly enjoy Mr. George W. Smalley's 
second series of "Anglo-American Memories" 
(Putnam). Reprinted chiefly from the New York 
" Tribune," these genially reminiscent chapters treat 
of persons who either now are or lately have been 
much in public notice ; as, for example, Mr. Winston 
Churchill, Mr. Balfour, Mr. Chamberlain, Lord 
Rosebery, Sir Edward Grey, Count Witte, Goldwin 
Smith, Whistler, Henry Irving, Mme. Bernhardt, 
and Mile. Descle'e, on the other side of the Atlantic ; 
and on this, Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan, Mr. Carnegie, 
Colonel Roosevelt, Thomas B. Reed, and Mr. White- 
law Reid. A significant utterance from our strenu- 
ous Colonel will attract attention. "You think I 
am impulsive," said he, "and perhaps I am. But I 
will tell you one thing. Never yet have I entered 
upon any great policy till I was satisfied I had be- 
hind me a great body of public opinion." There 
speaks the astute opportunist. Recalling the earlier 
years of his acquaintance with Mr. Roosevelt, the 
author says: "The two or three days I spent with 
Governor Roosevelt at Albany left me with the im- 
pression that his masterful good intentions would 
lead him far. We all now know that they did, though 
whether we have even yet measured the whole dis- 
tance may be a question. For the considered judg-

merit of the community embodied in statutes he 
seemed to have less respect than for his own indi- 
vidual opinion. He had, I thought, less reverence 
for law than most Americans have; or once had." 
And in the eyes of Europe we have always been an 
awful example of disrespect for law. Concerning the 
Russo-Japanese treaty for which such high credit has 
been accorded to the then President of the United 
States, Mr. Smalley, who was at Portsmouth all the 
time the diplomatic negotiations were in progress, 
has much to say that is well worth reading. " I sum 
it all up in this way," says he in conclusion. "It 
was Count Witte who, with that 'fortunate astute- 
ness' which is Machiavelli's ideal in The Prince, 
brought the American people back to their ancient 
friendship for Russia, and with them the President. 
It was Count Witte who formed that body of Ameri- 
can opinion without which Mr. Roosevelt, as I have 
elsewhere related, never, he said, entered upon a 
great policy. ... It was therefore first of all Count 
Witte, and perhaps secondly the Russian Emperor, 
who were the real authors of the Peace of Ports- 
mouth. President Roosevelt's intervention was use- 
ful and was made with great courage and judgment 
at the right moment. But of itself it would not have 
availed." The wide range of Mr. Smalley 's acquaint- 
ance among the great, his good taste and excellent 
discretion in reporting their talk and their actions, 
and the pleasing quality of his style, make these 
"Anglo-American Memories" most agreeable read- 
ing. 

In a significant and closely-reasoned 
work entitled " The Sociological 
Study of the Bible " (University of 
Chicago Press), Mr. Louis Wallis has traced the 
rise of the Christian religion from its embryonic 
beginnings among the Hebrews, and traced it, for 
the first time, under its sociological aspects. The 
rise of the unique religion of Israel and its flowering 
in Christianity has been interpreted as a develop- 
ment from the worship of a purely tribal god, 
Yahweh, to that of a universal god who set the 
interests of universal justice over all merely tribal 
or national interests. When asked, however, why 
the worship of Yahweh should thus develop, rather 
than the worship of his neighboring and once just 
as powerful god Chemosh, the higher critics have 
had to fall back on some such explanation as "the 
genius of the Hebrew prophets." But even personal 
genius cannot spring up out of relation to the social 
and other environmental forces around it. It is, 
then, in terms of those forces that Mr. Wallis seeks 
to show how the religion of the Bible grew. He 
finds the explanation in the collision and gradual 
amalgamation of the wandering Canaanitish clans, 
with their mountain god Yahweh and their nomadic 
code of ethics which recognized the brotherhood of 
all men in the clan, and the settled Amorites who 
occupied Canaan, lived in independent cities, and 
had a code of ethics which recognized class distinc- 
tions and regarded the serf classes as having few or

no rights. As soon as the Hebrews settled down 
in this land they took over these sophisticated and 
aristocratic ideas. The new status of affairs natur- 
ally bore down heavily upon the poorer Israelites, 
and so their hill prophets came to associate their 
tribal god Yahweh with their old nomadic ideas of 
brotherly justice, and to oppose that conception to 
the " Baal worship " of the cities with its attendant 
love of luxury and ceremony. Hence arose the 
fusion of the idea of justice with that of the Israel- 
itish god. Then came conquest and the Exile, a 
national experience which showed the greatest of 
the prophets that their god's idea of justice was not 
confined to the well-being of Israel but meant a 
universal justice which Israel as well as the other 
nations of the earth had to acknowledge. Re- 
demption then became the watchword of the Jewish 
religion, and the redemptive idea gradually took on 
the characteristics which Jesus and Paul found 
ready to their hands and of which they made so 
revolutionary a use. Mr. Wallis does not confine 
himself to the rise of Bible religion only, but 
traces the social factor in the later growth of 
Christianity, through the Reformation, and on to 
the contemporary situation. Although his book is 
for the layman, he writes in a thoroughly scientific 
manner, and the lesson he draws from this great 
development is that the church of to-day should 
recognize the bearings of the social problem on 
religion, and while avoiding all fixed programmes 
of reform, see to it that the church, made in part 
as it is by social pressure, should react on the 
social situation and impress it with the idealism 
whose sanctuary the church is meant to be. 



"A Chance Medley of Legal Points 
fheTaw. f and Le 8 al Stories" (Little, Brown,

" Silk and Stuff " in the Pall Mall Gazette " (1893-

diligence in searching the annals of English juris- 
prudence has placed us under obligations for so en- 
tertaining a collection of not too familiar anecdotes. 
To be sure, we find Disraeli's well-known saying 
if Disraeli ever said it, which the compiler gravely 
doubts, and he gives the reason for his doubts: 
"Everybody knows the stages of a lawyer's career: 
he tries in turn to get on, to get honors, to get hon- 
est." But we also find many other equally good and 
more authentic witticisms as, for example : " An at- 
torney died so poor perhaps it was he of whom it 
was said that he had so few effects because he had 
so few causes that his friends had to make a shil- 
ling subscription to bury him. One of them asked 
Curran for that contribution. 'Here's a sovereign,' 
was the answer ; ' bury twenty ! ' " That was an apt 
reply, too, which Lord Chief Justice Russell made, 
in his pre-judicial days when he was only a stuff- 
gownsman and a brother barrister asked him in court 
what was the extreme penalty for bigamy. "Two 
mothers-in-law," came the ready answer. The same

kind of wit, but unintentionally displayed, marked 
the reply of a pi'isoner who was pleading in his own 
defense but failed to make himself distinctly heard 
by the judge. " What was your last sentence ? " asked 
his honor. " Six months," respectfully returned the 
prisoner at the bar. Let it not be inferred, however, 
that the book is wholly devoted to such tit-bits of 
humor; many incidents and cases are cited for the 
sake of their bearing on present-day events, and ap- 
parently to encourage the reader to do a little serious 
thinking for himself. Incidentally the book cites 
some cases that might serve as good illustrations to 
Mr. Samuel B. Chester's recent "Anomalies of the 
English Law." Possibly the anonymous compiler 
is Mr. Chester himself. At all events, "A Chance 
Medley" is a curiously learned and well-edited 
piece of work. 

Memories of Southern writers on Civil War sub- 
Gen. Wheeler's . , j , j ,, . .. 
Confederate jects have devoted their attention 

cavalrv. largely to the Army of Northern 

Virginia, somewhat to the neglect of the other 
armies of the Confederacy, although the task be- 
fore the armies of the West was in some respects 
even greater than that set for the army of Lee. 
General Basil Duke's Reminiscences, published last 
year, was devoted to an account of soldier life in the 
Western army. Mr. DuBose's book on "General 
Joseph Wheeler and the Army of Tennessee " 
(Neale) deals largely with matters of tactics and 
strategy. The author, with his four brothers, served 
in Wheeler's cavalry. Consequently the volume is, 
to a certain extent reminiscencial ; but the author 
has also made considerable use of historical sources, 
and the result is a work of considerable value. Of 
particular interest is the author's estimate of the 
value of the cavalry arm to the Confederate cause. 
It is his theory that although the Confederate cavalry 
was on the whole superior to the Federal cavalry, 
its extraordinary value was not understood by 
the Confederate authorities during the early years 
of the conflict, and therefore the peculiar military 
capacity of the Southern people was not fully de- 
veloped. Numerous private letters throw interest- 
ing side-lights on many phases of the conflict. The 
primary purpose of the book, however, is to give 
an account of the military career of General Joseph 
Wheeler as commander of the cavalry in the Army 
of Tennesse. Particularly clear is the author's ac- 
count of the misfortunes which resulted from the 
change of Confederate commanders at Atlanta. Mr. 
DuBose evidently approves the policy of General 
Johnston, not that of General Hood and the Con- 
federate president. 

Judge Oliver Perry Temple, of Knox- 
ville > Tennessee, who died in 1907, 
had long been devoted to the study 
of the history of East Tennessee. During his life- 
time he published two historical works, " The Cove- 
nanter, the Cavalier, and the Puritan," and "East 
Tennessee and the Civil War," of which the latter 
especially was a work of considerable merit. Now 



there appears from the Cosmopolitan Press of New 
York a posthumous work, compiled and arranged by 
Judge Temple's daughter, Miss Mary B. Temple, 
which bears the title "Notable Men of Tennessee 
from 1833 to 1875, Their Times and Their Contem- 
poraries." Had the words "East Tennessee " been 
used instead of "Tennessee" the title would have 
been a more accurate one; for, with one exception, 
all the leaders in politics (about thirty in number) 
whose lives are sketched by Judge Temple lived and 
were active in the Eastern section of the State. It 
should have been indicated, also, that only Unionist 
"notables" are included: there is no biography, for 
example, of Landon C. Haynes. Some of the 
sketches cover not more than a page or two, but 
those of William G. Brownlow and Andrew Johnson 
are of considerable length. As might be expected 
from the circumstances of its preparation, the book 
suffers from some discursiveness of style and some 
repetition of facts. The author was a partisan in 
times when feeling ran high, and his likes and dis- 
likes remained strong. But the recollections are 
those of an honest and able observer and a consci- 
entious narrator, and the book, despite the limitations 
suggested, and the absence of an index, constitutes 
a valuable contribution to the history of East Ten- 
nessee. 



NOTES. 



The very effective set of drawings of the Panama 
Canal made by Mr. Joseph Pennell for " The Century," 
some of which appear in the August issue of that mag- 
azine, has been purchased by the government for the 
print collection of the Library of Congress. The his- 
torical value of Mr. Pennell's pictures is increased by the 
fact that with the letting in of the water the picturesque- 
ness of this part of the Canal work will be largely 
obliterated. 

After eleven years of deliberation the San Francisco 
Board of Supervisors has voted to accept the three- 
quarters of a million dollars offered by Mr. Carnegie as 
a contribution toward a new library building. No city 
could stand in much greater need of such a building, 
and, consequently, of the funds wherewith to erect it, 
than San Francisco. Thus one can surmise the weighti- 
ness of the scruples so long delaying a glad acceptance 
of the money. 

A new series of selections from the letters and 
diaries of Queen Victoria, with an introduction by Lord 
Esher, has been sanctioned by King George. The pub- 
lication will take the form of two illustrated volumes, 
entitled "The Girlhood of Queen Victoria," and will 
give interesting glimpses of the royal author from her 
thirteenth year to the time of her marriage in 1840. 
Mr. John Murray, the publisher of the first series, will 
publish also the second. 

The recent unveiling of the allegorical figures, 
"Science" and "Art," now at last in place on their 
long-expectant pedestals in front of the Boston Public 
Library, marks the completion of that fine building as 
projected a quarter of a century ago by the architects. 
The late Augustus Saint-Gaudens had originally been 
commissioned to furnish the statues, but his untimely

death made necessary the engagement of another sculp- 
tor. To Mr. Bela Pratt the task was finally assigned, 
and the fine bronze figures that have now come from 
his hand give the noble building's front that finishing 
touch it has so long wanted. 

Endowment of the Mark Twain Memorial Library, at 
Redding, Connecticut, with a sufficient fund to provide 
for its support is now, thanks to Mr. Carnegie, an ac- 
complished fact. The history of this interesting library 
is briefly as follows. When Mr. Clemens took up his 
abode at Redding he gave the town a collection of sev- 
eral thousand volumes from his own library, and placed 
them in a small vacant chapel for public use. These 
temporary quarters soon gave place to a more suitable 
building, erected by him as a memorial to his daughter 
Jean; and after his death the greater part of his own 
remaining library was added to the collection. Hitherto 
it has been from voluntary contributors that this me- 
morial library has received its support. 

The untimely death of an eminent French scientist 
and author is reported from Paris in the passing away 
of Jules Henri Poincoire', a cousin of the French 
premier, on the seventeenth of July, from the bursting 
of an artery. A serious surgical operation had been 
undergone by him two weeks earlier, with every pros- 
pect of recovery. Poincoire' was born at Nancy in 
1854, and had devoted his life largely to mathematical 
studies, holding chairs in the University of Paris and 
the Polytechnic School. One of his earliest and most 
popular books was " La Science et PHypothese," which 
soon reached a circulation of twenty thousand copies in 
his own country and was republished abroad. Among 
the stories illustrating the bent of his genius, there is 
an especially pleasing one which describes his infant 
ecstasies 011 first viewing the starry heavens. Astronomy 
became later one of his favorite studies. 

A long-desired biography, that of the late Walter 
Bagehot, who has been dead thirty-five years but is still 
remembered as one of the best talkers of his day and 
one of the best writers of any day, is to be undertaken 
at last. R. H. Button, friend of Bagehot and editor of 
" The Spectator," would have been the one best equip- 
ped for the task; but as he left the work undone, Mrs. 
Russell Barrington, known for her studies of Watts and 
Leighton, comes forward to supply the omission. The 
author of " Lombard Street " and a treatise on the En- 
glish Constitution is now best remembered for his shorter 
pieces, such as his biographical studies of leading Vic- 
torian statesmen. His brilliance and stimulus as a talker 
may be surmised from the aptness and originality of 
phrase that mark his written style. " The cake of cus- 
tom " is perhaps his most familiar contribution to our 
phraseology; "animated restraint," as the characteristic 
of good writing, will also be cherished in remembrance, 
and likewise his expression of regret that those who 
write have seldom done anything worth writing about, 
while those who do things worth recording are com- 
monly disinclined to spread them on paper.

ANONYMITY AND PSEUDONYMITY. 



Certain recent anonymous or pseudonymous 
books "One Way Out," for instance, and 
"The Corner of Harley Street " and "A Living 
Without a Boss," and a little earlier "The In- 
ner Shrine," and a number of others illustrate 
the ease and freedom and un-selfconsciousness 
which a writer is at liberty to enjoy, if he will, 
when he gives expression to his thought or 
invention, his whim or his fancy, without being 
saddled by that Old Man of the Sea, his own 
personality in the form of an irrevocably unal- 
terable name, with all that that name has come 
to stand for in his own mind, in the mind of 
others, and in the mind of the supreme intelli- 
gence that knows him for what he really is. 
Like little children who play with the keenest 
zest and the completest abandon when they 
are "making believe" and impersonating other 
characters, most imaginative authors like to 
indulge, now and then if not habitually, in 
just this sort of innocent make-believe. To 
objectify or dramatize oneself before putting pen 
to paper seems to promote a freer flow of words, 
to bring a richer supply of images, to fertilize 
the invention and stimulate the fancy. 

Charles Lamb's most sympathetic biographer, 
Mr. E. V. Lucas, suggests that possibly in the 
pseudonym "Elia" may be found a reason for 
the difference between the comparative thinness 
of Lamb's earlier or pre-Elian productions and 
the richness and color of his famous Essays. 
There are some writers, he remarks, who, para- 
doxical though it may seem, can never express 
themselves so freely as when, adopting a dra- 
matic standpoint, they affect to be some one 
else. Goldsmith is pointed to as one who "was 
always happier in his work when he imagined 
his pen to be held by another." The harmless 
imposture lends courage, emboldens diffidence, 
and begets a fine carelessness of criticism. 
Under a euphonious and dignified name, who 
could not give better expression to exalted 
sentiments than under one of trivial and com- 
monplace character ? If a lover of his country 
burns with a desire to deliver himself of an 
eloquent philippic against the arrogant pre- 
tensions of the Prince of Patagonia, into how 
much finer a frenzy will he work himself as 
"Demosthenes Philopatris " than as (let us say)

THE DIAL 



[August 16, 



Abner E. Small ! Or if the ardent swain wishes 
to pen a lyric in praise of his sweetheart's blue 
eyes and descriptive of the passion they inspire 
in his breast, small headway will he make until 
he ceases to think of himself as George Griggs 
and assumes the character of some imaginary 
Launcelot or Alphonso or Francesco. 

A marked example of that reluctance often felt 
by a writer of imagination and wit to be known 
as the father of his own literary offspring is 
furnished by the lamented Edward Rowland 
Sill, the premature silencing of whose graceful 
and sprightly pen will ever be a cause for keen 
regret. Near the end of his too-short life, and 
after he had proved himself a master in both 
prose and verse, he wrote to a friend: 

"When anything of mine is to be printed I have 
often a horrid sense now the fingers of the whole uni- 
verse will be pointing at this fellow as an example of a 
wretch that has mistaken his vocation. When it is once 
printed, I feel instantly relieved, in the knowledge that 
nobody reads things after all or cares whether they 
are good or not. The fingers I perceive to be all point- 
ing at more conspicuous objects, or being harmlessly 
sucked in the mouth: so I don't care a bit till the 
next thing is about to be printed. . . . You would not 
believe how I have actually shuddered internally each 
month with fear that now I am going to be stuck up on 
a post without a rag on me at last, and my nightmare 
was to come true." 

Again he writes, with something of the same 
amusing exaggeration which self-contemplation 
tends to produce in many another besides him- 
self: 

" The trouble about signing one's name to poems is, 
that stupid people (and we are all pretty stupid some- 
times) persist in thinking every word literally autobio- 
graphical. I have had enough annoyance from that to 
sicken any one of ever writing verse again, or anything 
else but arithmetics and geographies. Even then some 
one would hate you for your view of the Indian Ocean, 
or fear the worst about your character because of your 
treatment of the Least Common Multiple. People are 
getting to write anonymously now and then. (You 
did n't write ' The Breadwinners,' did you ? Perhaps 
the Janitor at the University did or Bacon the printer, 
or Hy. Ward Beecher.)" 

Sill's parenthesized query brings to mind in- 
stances of that false or hypocritical anonymity 
which really seeks greater glory for the author, 
through a preliminary mystery and its adroit 
exploitation, than would have come to him had 
he simply and honestly avowed his authorship 
at the outset. Of course the anonymous issue 
of "The Breadwinners" is now known to have 
been dictated by no such paltry motive; but 
there is reason to suspect that Samuel Warren 
allowed the general curiosity aroused by the 
anonymity of "Ten Thousand a Year" to min- 



ister to its author's vanity. Beginning its serial 
appearance in "Black wood's Magazine" for Oc- 
tober, 1839, it continued its anonymous course 
up to August, 1841, evoking many conjectures 
as to its authorship. Warren himself is said 
to have kept the conjecturers busy by asking 
everybody he met, " Who do you suppose wrote 
' Ten Thousand a Year ? ' "' At last one discern- 
ing person, upon being thus importuned, replied 
in a confidential whisper, " Well, my dear fellow, 
if you won't let it go any further, I '11 confess to 
you in private that I wrote it." Undoubtedly 
the "Letters of Junius" owe a large part of 
their fame to the mystery enveloping their au- 
thorship. Whether Sir Philip Francis wrote 
them, and whether he or whoever did write 
them foresaw the vogue which their anonymity 
would help to give them, who shall say ? It is 
certainly one of the best-kept secrets in literary 
history. 

In choosing a pseudonym, as in naming a 
child, there is need of wisdom. To have been 
projected without one's consent into this world 
of sorrow and sin and strife is bad enough. To 
be handicapped after one's arrival by being 
tagged with an unprepossessing or ridiculous or 
otherwise objectionable label is an addition of 
insult to injury. Therefore, since we cannot 
choose our ancestors or our baptismal names, 
there is all the more reason why one should pro- 
ceed cautiously in selecting the pen-name that 
is to help make or mar the fortunes of one's 
literary efforts. It is well known that our fore- 
most humorist deeply regretted in later years 
that he had not chosen for himself, in addition 
to the whimsical pseudonym now forever asso- 
ciated with "Innocents Abroad" and "Rough- 
ing It," a second and less oddly suggestive name 
for works of serious thought and purpose. Read- 
ers persisted in laughing over anything signed 
"Mark Twain," whether there was anything 
funny in it or not. There is something truly 
pathetic in the wail he uttered over the re- 
ception accorded to his first essay in a serious 
vein. 

"Well, in due course of time the book ['The Prince 
and the Pauper '] came out. To me it was a crucial 
point in my life. My anxiety over its reception at the 
hands of the literary critics was so great that I could n't 
sleep or eat. It will not be hard to imagine my chagrin, 
then, when they came out with yards of slush in which 
they called this, my first serious work, my masterpiece 
of humor said it was just about the funniest thing 
that had ever come off a press. Mind you, this was not 
the verdict of one or two or three of these literary 
know-it-alls it was unanimous. . . . By the time I 
had been assaulted and battered in seven or eight Ian-

guages by this literary riffraff I gave it up and decided 
that there was no remedy for their kind of mania. The 
only satisfaction I ever had out of it is in holding that 
I was right and they were all wrong. I have never 
altered that opinion." 

The history of pseudonymity is enlivened with 
many anecdotes illustrating the danger that a 
pseudonym, or any fictitious name used in story- 
writing, however odd and however carefully 
chosen, may prove to be the name of a real 
living person who will turn up some day and 
make trouble for his literary namesake. A 
curious and indeed an almost incredible in- 
stance of this nature, having to do with the 
assumed name of a person and the assumed 
name of a town, is related by Mr. J. Henry 
Harper in that recent treasury of literary his- 
tory and anecdote, "The House of Harper," 
which also gives in full the Mark Twain incident 
referred to above. One day there came by mail 
to Dr. Irenaeus Prime, in his capacity as editor 
of "The Drawer" in "Harper's Magazine," a 
story containing a personal name and a geo- 
graphical name, but of so richly humorous a 
character that, despite its indulgence in a per- 
sonality that might give offense, supposing it 
to be a true story, he decided to publish, first 
however changing both personal and geograph- 
ical names for the sake of greater safety. To 
his astonishment and chagrin, after publication 
there came a letter to the publishers couched 
in the most abusive and threatening language, 
and vowing that the house of Harper should be 
made to pay dearly for its unauthorized printing 
of the incident in question. It was afterward 
ascertained that the contributor of the anecdote 
had himself substituted fictitious for real names, 
and Dr. Prime, with too great precaution, had 
inadvertently, and by something little short of 
a miracle, changed the fictitious names back to 
the real ones. 

But this is a digression. The charm of the 
unknown will continue, as long as anonymous 
and pseudonymous literature is written, to ap- 
peal more or less potently to the reader; while 
the sense of having created a mystery, of hav- 
ing erected a more or less impenetrable screen 
between himself and his public, will tickle the 
author's fancy. Of course in many depart- 
ments of authorship the writer's real name 
ought to appear and in most instances will ap- 
pear. But to the airy creation of a poet's or a 
romancer's or a humorist's fancy it will often 
seem more appropriate to assign a fictitious 
authorship, or to leave the authorship entirely 
a matter of conjecture. 



GAS UAL COMMENT. 

THE PUERILITIES OF GENIUS reach their limit in 
the silly devices by which, as the Baconians would 
have us believe, the real authorship of the Shake- 
speare plays is half concealed and half revealed in 
the wording of certain passages, in the arrangement 
of the lines as printed in the First Folio, and even 
in the minutest details of typography sometimes 
so minute as to require a microscope for detection. 
That untiring advocate of the Baconian cause, 
Sir Edwin Durning- Lawrence, ingenious author of 
" Bacon is Shakespeare," has followed up his larger 
work (which did not quite convert the world to his 
faith) with an entertaining pamphlet, "The Shake- 
speare Myth," wherein if any remaining doubters 
fail to find that which shall forever remove their 
lingering hesitations, they are certainly beyond 
praying for and deserve no further attention at the 
hands of Sir Edwin. In speaking of the First 
Folio, the writer says, among other memorable 
things: "I must also inform my readers that every 
page is divided into two columns, and it is abso- 
lutely certain that the author himself so arranged 
these that he knew in what column and in what 
line in such column every word would appear in 
the printed page." Thus it was by Bacon's express 
design that in the opening scene of "The Tempest" 
there was a certain arrangement of lines that gave, 
by putting together three initial letters and reading 
them upward and also using the first word of one 
of these lines, "hang'd hog," which, as mistress 
Quickly has reminded us in "The Merry Wives of 
Windsor," is Latin for bacon. Elsewhere in the 
Folio, Sir Edwin discovers " hang sow," which he 
gravely assures us "is just as much Bacon as Hang 
hog." And again, in "Antony and Cleopatra" three 
words (Pompey, in, and got) are found in such a 
position as obviously to stand for pig, "which is what 
we were looking for," triumphantly declares Sir 
Edwin Burning-Lawrence. Coming to graver issues, 
he informs us that " all writers are agreed that our 
language of to-day is founded upon the English 
translation of the Bible and upon the Plays of 
Shakespeare. Every word of each of these was 
undoubtedly written by, or under the direction of, 
Francis Bacon." So industrious, inventive, and en- 
tertaining a writer as Sir Edwin Durning-Lawrence 
deserves our gratitude for the amusement he fur- 
nishes, and our admiration for his zeal and perse- 
verance in the face of a doubting and even derisive 
public; but if the author of "Hamlet" and "Othello" 
was really capable of all the puerilities he so labor- 
iously brings to our attention, we prefer, for our 
own enjoyment of the plays and poems, to remain 
erroneously persuaded of their Shakespearean origin. 


INSPIRATIONAL TOXINS, such as alcohol, opium, 
hashish, and tobacco, have long been known to and 
more or less used by literary and other creative 
artists; but probably few if any of these men of 



90 



THE DIAL 



[August 16, 



genius have been inclined to regard as aids to in- 
spiration those natural toxins of the body that are 
generated by tuberculosis, asthma, gout, and other 
diseases. Nevertheless, when one recalls the bril- 
liance and the creative energy that have charac- 
terized many a consumptive writer Stevenson 
and John Addington Symonds, for instance the 
asthma that accompanied Macaulay's prodigious 
accomplishment as reader and writer, and that was 
powerless to impair the masterly statesmanship of 
William the Third, and the gout that seemed but 
to steady and strengthen the purpose of Gibbon in 
his formidable undertaking, and when one looks 
back upon innumerable other instances of signal 
achievement, in letters and in other walks of life, in 
the face of pronounced physical disability, one may 
well feel tempted to believe with Dr. Charles B. 
Reed, whose thoughtful and interesting article on 
"Toxemia as a Stimulus in Literature" has been 
much discussed, that toxins, both natural and arti- 
ficial, do play an important part in the work of 
the world, especially in the work done by men and 
women of genius. One might even go so far as to 
query whether anything of brilliance and genuine 
originality and power is to be found in the absence 
of some inspirational toxin. On the other hand, 
however, there are instances in plenty of genius 
unaccompanied by any apparent poisoning or intox- 
icating affection Scott and Goethe, for example. 
But no one knows exactly what help they received 
from artificial toxins, or what natural toxins may 
have been generated in their systems. Perhaps we 
shall know more about these things some day, and 
it may be that inspirational toxins, of specific kinds, 
will be injected in infancy to produce poets, novel- 
ists, musicians, sculptors, and so on, much as among 
the honey bees the queen is produced by certain 
methods of treatment applied in the earliest stages 
of the insect's formation. 



THE APPRAISAL OF CONTEMPORARY GREATNESS, 

whether in literature or in other departments of 
worthy achievement, is a difficult and more or less 
invidious task. Nevertheless the Modern Historic 
Records Association, in undertaking to collect auto- 
graphic utterances on parchment ''from men and 
women of genius throughout the world," has asked 
its secretary, Mr. W. T. Lamed, to prepare " a list of 
names that shall include all living men and women 
whose reputations are likely to endure," as Mr. 
Lamed expresses it in a letter to the New York 
"Sun" in which he asks for help in his difficult 
task. A tentative list of about two hundred names 
is submitted by him, naturally "with considerable 
diffidence," and of course it is impossible to glance 
over the list without noting many surprising omis- 
sions and almost as many astonishing inclusions. It 
could not be otherwise. For example, though the 
head of the Salvation Army is on the list, the name 
of Abdul Baha, the Persian religious reformer whose 
followers already are counted by the millions, in re- 
sponse to whose teachings a third of the population 



of Persia has renounced Mohammedanism for Baha- 
ism, and whose disciples are found all over the world, 
including this country, which he has recently visited, 
does not appear ; and while Colonel Henry Watter- 
son is included, Mr. Whitelaw Reid is excluded ; 
and it seems strange to find the name of Mr. George 
Bernard Shaw unaccompanied by that other with 
which we are wont to see it linked. In general the 
perspective is emphatically that of the Occidental 
rather than of the Oriental. Japan, China, India, 
and all the rest of the Far East, are ignored; while 
contrariwise America looms large and Europe (or at 
least western Europe) suffers no very serious eclipse. 
It is a pleasant enough diversion that the M. H. R. 
Association is engaged in, and one wishes it every 
success; but it ought not, perhaps, to be viewed 
with quite the seriousness that Mr. Larned's letter 
assumes. However, we are glad to quote in conclu- 
sion this passage from his letter: "The attempts to 
obtain these inscriptions, which are meant to embody 
a brief but permanent expression of each man and 
woman's preeminent gift or attainment, is meeting 
with some interesting responses. The opinion ex- 
pressed by Ambassador Bryce that the collection we 
are making 'will be of the greatest interest in years 
to come ' seems to be shared more especially by emi- 
nent men in Europe. For example, Sir William 
Ramsay has sent us a striking epitome of his career 
as a scientist; Dr. Alfred Russel Wallace a resound- 
ing paragraph from one of his most eloquent essays ; 
Mr. Maeterlinck a passage from his 'La Vie des 
Abeilles '; Sir Arthur Wing Pinero and Mr. George 
Bernard Shaw some characteristic thoughts on dra- 
matic workmanship." Any helpful suggestion, or 
other communication, on parchment or more perish- 
able paper, that the reader of this may feel moved 
to send to Mr. Lamed, will reach him, we doubt not, 
if addressed to the Modern Historic Records Asso- 
ciation, 14 Gramercy Park, New York City. 

THE PENSIONING OF WORN-OUT LIBRARIANS has 

certainly as much to be said in its favor as the 
pensioning of retired college professors and other 
teachers. It is indeed cause for surprise that our 
millionaire benefactor of public libraries should have 
established a professors' pension fund but taken no 
step to make comfortable the declining years of those 
who serve the needs of the great book-reading and 
book-borrowing public, and preside over, or otherwise 
give their best years to, the institutions of that class 
to which he himself has so generously contributed. 
As a matter of fact, the library worker is even less 
liberally paid for his toil than the teacher, his term 
of daily service is longer, and his vacations are very 
much shorter. The trustees of the Boston Public 
Library urge the necessity of some adequate pension 
system for its employees. They well say, in their 
latest Report: "A large part of library service is 
specialized work. It is very desirable that persons 
who enter the library profession should remain in 
it, and after they have been in this profession long 
enough to be of the best service to it they are prac- 



1912.] 



THE DIAL 



91 



tically unfitted for any other work. The margin 
between the salaries which can be paid them within 
the library appropriation and their necessary ex- 
penses for reasonable and decent living is very small. 
. . . The necessary result of this condition is that 
persons are retained in the library service after they 
cease to be able to do the best work, because they 
cannot be retired from it without becoming objects 
of charity or requiring the assistance of others for 
their support. The public service suffers from this 
because the worn-out employee cannot do as good 
work as ought to be done. The expense of the pub- 
lic service is also increased because it is necessary 
to have more employees if a portion of them are 
unable to do the best work. Merited promotion is 
also often delayed, and the tendency is to weaken 
the library service where it should be strengthened. 
A worn-out tool is the most expensive tool for use, 
whether it be a combination of merely material things 
like wood and metal, or a living human being." And 
so on. Legislation to meet the exigencies of the 
case is asked for; but legislative machinery is slow, 
and legislative grants for worthy causes are notably 
small and tardy. Here is a chance for some philan- 
thropic multi-millionaire to immortalize his name by 
establishing a great national Librarians' Retirement 
Pension Fund. ... 

THE ARTISTIC ATTITUDE TOWARD LITERATURE, as 

distinguished from the scientific or coldly critical at- 
titude, is very much what the artistic or sympathetic 
attitude toward life and mankind is as distinguished 
from the rigidly dogmatic or moralistic attitude. 
This is rather clumsily and inadequately expressed, 
but perhaps a few illustrations and analogies may 
make the meaning clearer. We have all had experi- 
ence of the irritating self-righteousness of those who 
pride themselves on making their conduct square 
with a hard-and-fast rule, without regard to the 
claims or the feelings of those about them. Their 
morality is static, not dynamic. They are moral 
pedants and mental sluggards. They have classified 
and labelled all the objects of their little world once 
and forever, with scientific precision. In one's bear- 
ing toward literature, and toward art in general, it is 
not uncommon to fall into the scientific rather than 
the artistic way of looking at things. One too easily 
forgets that reality is always dying and being re- 
created. Even the very words with which truth is 
expressed, or faintly adumbrated, are continually 
suffering decay and undergoing revivification. The 
literary artist, the merest framer of verbal para- 
doxes, helps to keep the pulse of life in our language 
and to save us from the indolent use of phrases 
chunks of sound, as Stevenson has called them to 
avoid the trouble of original and sympathetic thought. 
The poet is the consummate literary artist; his mind 
is cleared of cant, and he faces every new situation 
with fresh receptivity. Pater and others have 
warned us that what is done from habit is likely to be 
done mechanically and meaninglessly ; and habits of 
speech, still more habits of thinking, are spiritual 
death. This and other points that might well be 



touched upon here are more fully treated by Mr. 
E. F. Carritt in the current "Hibbert Journal," in 
an article entitled "The Artistic Attitude in Con- 
duct," which closes with Dr. Johnson's acute re- 
marks, preserved by Fanny Burney, on the subject 
of literary criticism : "There are three distinct kinds 
of judges: the first are those who know no rules but 
pronounce entirely from their natural taste and feel- 
ings; the second are those who know and judge by 
rules; and the third are those who know but are 
above the rules. These last are those you should wish 
to satisfy. Next to them rate the natural judges; 
but ever despise those opinions that are formed by 
the rules." ... 

LIBRARY PLANNING FROM THE INSIDE, or from 
the experienced librarian's standpoint, rather than 
from the outside that is, from the ambitious and 
splendor-loving architect's point of view is one of 
the many topics intelligently and fully treated by 
Mr. Soule in his manual on library-building, already 
noticed (too briefly) by us. "The exterior should 
not even be considered," he maintains, ''until the 
interior has been entirely mapped out." This advice 
will be found easier to follow than the old rule for 
the manufacture of cannon first make your hole, 
then cast the metal around it ; and the uniting of 
utility with ornament need not necessarily be at the 
expense of the latter. Indeed, some of the least 
pleasing library buildings, to those who fail to find 
any satisfying aesthetic- effect where there is unfit- 
ness of structure, are the very ones that have been 
designed from the outside with a view to external 
effect. Therefore let the architect take counsel at 
every step with the trained librarian. But it is 
quite true, nevertheless, as Mrs. Elmendorff took 
occasion to point out at one of the annual library 
conferences, that "a very good librarian may yet 
have no great fitness for the task of planning a 
building," and hence some other than the local 
librarian may best be called upon to advise with 
the architect. Mr. Soule utters a warning " not to 
take your local librarian at his own valuation. He 
is most likely to assume the function of an expert 
in building when he is least fitted. The really ex- 
perienced librarian is apt to be modest and to ask 
assistance, in the belief that 'two heads are better 
than one.'" But let not the "local librarian" 
whose eye may chance to rest on this paragraph 
take umbrage. There are local librarians and local 
librarians. In fact, when you come to think of it, 
how many librarians are there of any other sort ? 



A LIBRARY BURGLARY EXTRAORDINARY Was re- 
ported, under conspicuous scare-lines ("45,000 Vol- 
umes Missing from Library"), in a Los Angeles 
newspaper recently. In substance, the whole aston- 
ishing affair, as printed whether as a deliberate 
hoax, or a misprint, or a piece of careless reporting, 
or a fact having some basis of truth reduces itself 
to this, in the language of the journal itself: "There 
were 190,000 books in the library three years ago, 
according to an inventory taken then. There were

but 145,000 when the count was completed yester- 
day." And yet this disappearance of forty-five thou- 
sand volumes is not attributed to deliberate theft, 
but rather to mere " carelessness of public property, 
... in the opinion of Mr. Perry," the librarian; 
and the good citizens are requested to look through 
their bookshelves and see whether any forgotten 
library books are lurking there. No mention is made 
of the three years' accessions of new books, as if 
one were to understand that the collection had been 
undergoing steady and rapid depletion with no re- 
plenishing whatever which is much too marvel- 
lous, especially for the swiftly growing city of Los 
Angeles, to gain credence. To the modern vigilant 
librarian, an annual loss of even a score of volumes 
is a scandal and a disgrace; but fifteen thousand a 
year for three successive years ! 

" Obstupui, steteruntque comae, et vox faucibus hcesit." 

THE FAME OF STATIONERS' HALL IN LONDON, 
where for more than three hundred years registry 
has been made of books claiming copyright protec- 
tion, will long survive the cessation of that custom 
which marks the going into effect, this summer, 
of the new English copyright law. "Entered at 
Stationers' Hall " is a familiar legend that we shall 
fail to find in the printed works of the future, 
publication under the terms of the statute sufficing 
henceforth for the publisher's protection against 
piracy. The invaluable register of English books, 
from Elizabethan times to our own, will, it is rea- 
sonable to hope, be transferred now to the manu- 
script room of the British Museum, where it would 
be an object of interest to all students of English 
literature and could be more conveniently consulted 
than at present. The Stationers' Company itself, 
which has a curiously interesting history, and for a 
long time enjoyed a monopoly in the publication of 
almanacs in addition to its other rights and digni- 
ties, may now find itself left with nothing to justify 
its existence unless it enters the regular publishing 
field, which might not be unfitting in view of its 
position in the neighborhood of Paternoster Row, 
Amen Corner, and Ave Maria Lane, names that 
carry with them ancient associations of a more or 
less bookish and book-publishing nature.

THE CLEANNESS OF AMERICAN FICTION as COm- 

pared with English is asserted by a high Canadian 
authority, Dr. George H. Locke, librarian of the 
Toronto Public Library. In an address at the late 
annnal meeting of the Ontario Library Association, 
Dr. Locke said: "There is one thing I have to say, 
and I am sorry to say it, and that is that you can 
trust American fiction to be clean rather than En- 
glish fiction. There is no necessity to demonstrate 
except to step into my office and see the list of En- 
glish fiction that is nasty, unnecessarily nasty. It 
is hard to have to say that. Certain publishers you 
can rely on implicitly. In regard to your fiction, 
when you find a book is a good book buy another 
copy of it. Restrict your range, but be careful that 



the books you have are good books, books that are 
worth while." Some practical advice to librarians 
on the purchase of new books is worth quoting also : 
"Don't order fiction until the work has been out 
long enough to have adequate reviews of it. It is 
not wise to trust the ordinary reviews, or excerpts 
[of those reviews] published by the ordinary pub- 
lishers. You can take part of a recommendation 
and make a man out of anything from an angel 
down." Dr. Locke's remarks in full are to be found 
in "The Proceedings of the Ontario Library Asso- 
ciation, Twelfth Annual Meeting," issued by the 
Association in an illustrated pamphlet of 128 pages. 



LIBRARY RIVALRY is a good thing, so long as 
jealousies and recriminations are not indulged in by 
the rivals. Facts and figures to prove, ostensibly at 
least, the superior efficiency of the North Jonesville 
Public Library cannot be blamed for finding their 
way into the annual report of that beneficent insti- 
tution. From a descriptive pamphlet just issued by 
the Jersey City Public Library it is our pleasure and 
privilege to quote certain statistical .facts of a nature 
highly gratifying to the inhabitants of that city. 
"Cost per volume circulated is less in Jersey City 
than in any larger city. Efficiency in proportion to 
population: For each $1.00 expended in Jersey 
City the average expenditure in 18 cities is $1.49. 
For each 100 volumes circulated in Jersey City the 
average circulation in 18 cities is 81 volumes. In 
proportion to circulation : For each $1.00 expended 
in Jersey City the average expenditure in 18 cities 
is $1.82." Then follows a list of the eighteen less 
thrifty cities. They are the eighteen largest in the 
country, Jersey City being the nineteenth, according 
to the latest census. In these days, when all the 
world, or some considerable portion of it, is having 
its willing attention directed to the Governor of 
New Jersey, this passing mention of the prosperity 
and usefulness of one of that State's leading libraries 
may be not out of place. 



THE LATEST PUBLICATION OF THE DOFOBS (a 

well-known Chicago society of bibliophiles disrespect- 
fully characterized in words of which D. O. F. O. B. 
are the initial letters) is in an edition so strictly 
limited (fifty-two copies) that the present notice is 
not written with the book in hand, but on the au- 
thority of a fortunate possessor of the choice little 
volume. It is a book for Byron-lovers, containing 
facsimile reproductions of seven poems, among them 
the four so-called Thyrza poems and two addressed 
to the poet's half-sister Augusta. Fourteen letters 
of Byron's are also given all new to readers, it ap- 
pears, except a short passage in one of them. The 
book also contains a list of the books Byron is thought 
to have taken with him when he made his last jour- 
ney to Greece, and reproductions of five portraits of 
the poet, two being from drawings by George Henry 
Harlow. Preface and notes are supplied by Mr. W. 
N. C. Carlton, librarian of the Newberry Library.

ONE OF THE MAKERS OF 
MASSACHUSETTS.* 

In the list of Massachusetts colonial govern- 
ors, many of whom were able and forceful men 
and interesting characters, there is none that 
appeals more strongly to the imagination or ex- 
cites a greater admiration than the lawyer-soldier 
who came over from England in 1731 to throw 
in his lot with the young colony, who three years 
later became the "King's only Advocate- General 
in America," was appointed Governor in 1741, 
wrested the fortress of Louisburg from the 
French in 1745, reestablished the finances of 
his colony by redeeming its paper money in En- 
glish coin in 1749, thus giving Massachusetts 
an enviable reputation as "the hard-money col- 
ony," exerted himself strenuously in the face of 
insurmountable obstacles for the entire expulsion 
of the French from Canada, only relinquished 
the post he had so creditably held when the 
home government recalled him in 1756, and 
finally returned to die in the land of his adop- 
tion fifteen years later. 

This eminently successful man of action 
who, by the way, was helped in his rise to dis- 
tinction by a clever and appreciative wife has 
not unnaturally made romantic appeal to the 
Colonial Dames of America, and under their 
auspices his correspondence, to the extent at 
least of two substantial volumes, has been pre- 
pared for publication by Dr. Charles Henry 
Lincoln, whose previous studies in our Revolu- 
tionary and pre-Revolutionary history give as- 
surance of fitness for the task. The hitherto 
unpublished Shirley correspondence, in the keep- 
ing of the Public Record Office and the British 
Museum in London, of the Massachusetts His- 
torical Society and the State Archives in Boston, 
of the Library of Congress in Washington, of 
the Historical Societies of Connecticut, Penn- 
sylvania, and Maryland, and of other less im- 
portant depositories, is of generous bulk, and 
generous has been the editor's selection there- 
from, his two volumes containing more than 
eleven hundred pages of reading matter. Con- 
temporary maps, a portrait of Shirley, and other 
illustrative plates, together with a useful intro- 

* CORBESPONDENCE OF WlLLIAM SHIRLEY, Governor of 

Massachusetts and Military Commander in America. 1731- 
1760. Edited under the auspices of the National Society of 
the Colonial Dames of America. By Charles Henry Lin- 
coln, Ph.D. In two volumes. Illustrated. New York : The 
Macmillan Co. 



duction, frequent footnotes, and a fourteen-page 
index, are added. 

What is most striking in a general survey of 
Shirley's life is the generous breadth, the all- 
roundness, so to speak, the open-mindedness 
and many-sidedness, of the man. Above all, he 
seems to have preserved his name untarnished 
amid all the inevitable jealousies and contentions 
inseparable from high public office. His sense 
of honor appears in his refusal, in 1733, of the 
post of Judge of Admiralty, an office that he felt 
he could not accept because its incumbency de- 
pended on the good will of the local legislative 
assembly, and he therefore feared he could not 
impartially maintain the rights of the Crown. 
" So that," he says in his letter of declination to 
the Duke of Newcastle, "to have accepted this 
post in it's present situation, would have reduc'd 
me to the hard Choice of sacrificing the Court 
to a mean popularity, or making a sacrifice of 
myself in the defence of it ; the first neither hon- 
ourable nor honest, and the last not prudent." 

The letters selected for publication cover the 
period from 1731 to 1760, and are written to 
and from the Duke of Newcastle, the Lords of 
Trade, the General Court of Massachusetts, Sir 
William Pepperrell, Governor William Greene 
of Rhode Island, Sir William Johnson, and 
many others. There are also letters between Mrs. 
Shirley and the Duke of Newcastle in reference 
to the advancement of Shirley's fortunes in the 
administration of the colony. Under date of 
August 23, 1741, we find a letter of acknowl- 
edgment from the newly appointed Governor to 
the English minister whose influence with the 
Crown had secured him the post. After express- 
ing his sense of obligation to Newcastle, the 
writer continues in a strain that gives some idea 
of the difficulties and vexations he had to en- 
counter in accepting the proffered position. In 
one sentence of portentous length, and in the 
epistolary style of his time, Shirley thus depicts 
the situation: 

" I am sensible, My Lord Duke, that I am now ent- 
ring upon the Governmt of a province, where Col. 
Shute quitted the Chair, & Mr. Burnett broke his heart 
thro the Temper and Opposition of the people ; & Mr. 
Belcher in the midst of his Countrymen fail'd of carry- 
ing any one of those points for the Crown, wch might 
have been expected from him; and that I enter upon it 
at a time, when an empty Treasury, an Aversion in the 
House of Representatives to supply it conformably to 
his Majy's last Instructions; a weak and Ruinous Con- 
dition of their Fortifications, a bad Spirit rais'd through- 
out the Country by the Land Bank Scheme, by means 
of it's being conniv'd at here in it's first rise, remaining 
uncheck'd so long, that the imprudt manner of endeav- 
ouring to check it here afterwards by those who were

at the same time endeavouring to support & countenance 
it at home thro Mr. Partridge, only inflamed it; & Mr. 
Belcher's constant acceptance from year to year of a 
Diminished Salary, after he had obtained leave to take 
it without insisting upon his Majesty's Instruction on 
that head, the value of wch is by that means sunk from 
abt 1000 1. Sterl. wch had been allow'd by the Genl 
Court to Governr Burnett and himself with a promise to 
the former of 'em to continue as ample an Allowance, 
down to the Value of 650 1. Sterl. wch seems to have 
been done by him with some particular View of his own, 
to secure his station by the smallness of his Salary; are 
what make up the present Scene of Affairs in the pro- 
vince, whereupon the House of Representatives tell me 
in their Address, that they are concern'd my Accession 
to the Chair should be attended with such Difficulties." 

The next event of supreme importance 
touched upon in the letters is the capture of 
Louisburg, a difficult military operation in 
which little aid was received or indeed ex- 
pected from the mother country, and which 
owed its success chiefly to Shirley's ability in 
arousing the martial enthusiasm of New En- 
gland, in adjusting the differences between 
Admiral Sir Peter Warren and Sir William 
Pepperrell, and in conceiving and causing to 
be executed a bold and brilliant plan of attack. 
"Probably every prudent strategist would have 
deemed the scheme foolhardy," says Mr. J. A. 
Doyle in his sketch of Shirley's life ; and Shirley 
himself allows his sense of the splendid success 
achieved in the face of formidable obstacles to 
appear underneath the modesty and restraint 
of his language in communicating the event to 
the Lords of Trade. He says, in concluding 
his brief account of the action: 

" Upon the whole, I hope when it is considered that 
3,600 raw New England Troops, supported by His 
Majesty's Ships to the seaward, have reduc'd one of 
the French King's strongest and most important Fort- 
resses, having in it a Garrison of near 600 regular 
Troops, and about 1400 Effective Men under Arms 
besides, with the Loss of not quite 100 men on our 
side, and killing near the same number of the Enemy 
within the Walls during the Siege (many of them with 
their Small Arms) I may be permitted to say in Justice 
to His Majesty's New England Subjects that their be- 
haviour has done no dishonour to his Arms." 

In far more self -applausive vein, knowing the 
temper of those he is addressing, does Gov- 
ernor Shirley proclaim to the Penobscot and 
Norridgewock Indians the signal victory of the 
English and colonial forces over the perfidious 
French, and the expectations entertained as to 
the future policy of the red men. He thus con- 
cludes : 

"This Intelligence we Send you that you may not 
be deluded by the French or St. Johns & Nova Scotia 
Indians that may Sollicit you to break your Friendship 
with us to your own ruin. We have been your faithful 
Friends, and your Traffick with us has been much more 



for your Advantage than your Trade with the French 
and you may still live easy with us, & free from the 
distress & danger of War if you please but if not, & 
you will let the French & the Indians in their Interest 
deceive & Seduce you & you will perfidiously break 
your Solemn League with us, we doubt not but the 
Great God who is the Avenger of all such Wickedness 
and has so remarkably punished our Treacherous 
Enemys the French will stand by us & give us Success 
for the punishing your perfidiousness, but if you are 
willing to Enjoy the Benefits of peace with us, we Shall 
Expect that you will Send two or three of your chief 
Captains to Confirm the Friendship between Us, and if 
any of your people stand in fear of the French and 
therefore want protection for themselves and their 
Familys and will come to Boston, we will take care of 
them, I Expect that you Send me your answer without 
delay." 

After General Braddock's untimely end, the 
command of all the British forces in America 
devolved upon Shirley, who just then was per- 
sonally engaged in leading the unsuccessful 
expedition against Fort Niagara. He seems 
to have had friction in his relations with the 
masterful Sir William Johnson, and as even a 
jaundiced view of our hero may help to a better 
knowledge of his character, let us quote a few 
lines, here and there, from Johnson's indignant 
appeal to the Lords of Trade. 

" Govr. Shirleys conduct not only shook the system 
of Indian affairs, gave me fresh vexation and perplexity, 
but occasioned considerable and additional Expenses 
which would otherwise have been saved; . . . From 
Govr. Shirley's late Behaviour and his Letters to me 
I am under no doubt that he is become my inveterate 
enemy and that the whole weight of his Powers and 
abilities will be exerted to blast if he can my Character 
here and here only am I anxious. Gross Falsehoods 
(such as he has already asserted in his letters to me,) 
artful misrepresentations, Deliberate malice, Resent- 
ment worked up by People in his confidence, whose 
Interest, nay whose very livelihood depends upon their 
inflaming him these my Lords are circumstances 
which I own disturb me. . . . From Govr. Shirley's 
ill grounded resentment, from the imperious stile he 
writes to me since Genl. Braddock's death, from his 
threatning intimations and his temper, I am confirmed 
in this lesson, that a subordinate power here with regard 
to Indian Affairs . . . will be incompatible with my 
abilities and inclinations to conduct them." 

Evidently there was not room on the same con- 
tinent for both Shirley and Johnson, although 
Shirley's relations with other prominent men 
and high officials in the colonies were remark- 
ably harmonious. His requests for advice from 
Franklin and the latter's high opinion of him 
help to establish his reputation as a wise and 
just administrator. The circumstances of his 
recall and his attitude toward both his successor 
and the home government also go far to confirm 
our favorable opinion of him as one who con- 
trolled his passions and nursed no ignoble resent-

merits. His subsequent governorship of the 
Bahamas, and his return to Massachusetts to 
pass the last year of his life in the then rural 
seclusion of Roxbury, are matters not touched 
upon in Mr. Lincoln's volumes, except that one 
short letter from the Bahamas is printed at the 
very end, and brief mention of Shirley's last 
years is made in the Introduction. 

That portion of the public whom the Colonial 
Dames and Mr. Lincoln seek to interest in this 
conspicuously able and energetic colonial gov- 
ernor will not be disappointed in the manner 
his letters have been presented for their enter- 
tainment and instruction ; and the volumes will 
be the more welcome since, apart from his 
own correspondence, no extended account of 
Shirley's life and public services is to be found 
in print. The preparation of a formal biography 
has been greatly facilitated by Mr. Lincoln's 



labors.

Ox CANADA'S REMOTE FRONTIERS.* 



In four recent volumes of travels we are 
taken from the extreme northwest to the extreme 
northeast of Canada; from the valley of the 
Yukon to Cape Chidley at the entrance to 
Hudson Straits. Though they vary greatly in 
everything else that goes to make up the real 
value of a book, they all possess at least the 
merit of being first-hand narratives. Mr. 
Tollemache's book describes his hunting and 
trapping experiences on the upper waters of the 
Yukon ; Sir John Rogers tells us of his sporting 
adventures on Vancouver Island and Newfound- 
land; Mr. Cabot gives an account of several at- 
tempts to penetrate the interior of the Labrador 
peninsula ; and Dr. Hutton reveals the life of a 
doctor among the Eskimo. Taken as contribu- 
tions to literature, the first may be described as 
poor ; the second as mediocre ; the third as good ; 
and the last as a book in a thousand. All four 
writers have chosen fields that had been already 
visited and described by others, but the results 
are vastly different. It may be taken as an 
axiom that no man is justified in imposing upon 
a long-suffering public his experiences in a 
familiar region unless those experiences add

something new, and worth while, to the sum of 
human knowledge. 

Mr. Tollemache admits that many books on 
the Yukon had appeared previous to his own, 
and that the subject had become somewhat 
hackneyed ; but he urges, modestly enough, that 
he had become acquainted with incidents and 
methods of life in that remote region which he 
had not seen printed in other volumes. His 
narrative hardly bears out the promise. It is 
for the most part an account of trapping adven- 
tures, fur-trading and travelling on the Pelly, 
McMillan, and other upper waters of the Yukon, 
which have been at least as well described by 
other travellers. His account of the Klondyke 
boom, the mining camps, the dance-halls in 
Dawson, and other features of Yukon life a few 
years ago, has of course been covered by a score 
of earlier writers. Finally, when he deals with 
facts outside his own particular line of vision, 
Mr. Tollemache is all at sea. He expresses 
amazement at the sale of Alaska by Russia for 
"such an absurdly small figure," evidently alto- 
gether ignorant of the history of that interest- 
ing transaction. He tells us that "the term 
' capitalist ' is a common denomination in Canada 
and the United States, and may include anyone 
possessing $100 or more in ready cash." Fi- 
nally, he affords the interesting bit of informa- 
tion that "Quebec, in Eastern Canada, forms the 
principal resort of the French Canadians." 

"Sport in Vancouver and Newfoundland" is 
essentially the narrative of an enthusiastic fisher- 
man. To anyone interested in sporting adven- 
tures in out-of-the-way corners of the earth, Sir 
John Rogers's book cannot prove otherwise than 
entertaining. He is not only a keen sportsman, 
with all the true sportsman's relish for the de- 
tails of fishing-tackle, weather conditions, camp 
equipment, and weight of fish, but he has also a 
thorough appreciation of scenery. This passage, 
written after an unsuccessful day with the sal- 
mon, is a good example of his descriptive style. 

" The row home that evening compensated for every- 
thing. The sun was setting behind the snow-covered 
peaks of the Vancouver Mountains, bare and cold below 
the snow-line, but gradually clothed with foliage down 
the slopes until the dense pine forest of the plain be- 
tween the mountains and the sea was reached, from 
which the evening mists were beginning to rise. In 
the foreground, the sea, like molten glass, reflected the 
exquisite colouring of the northern sunset, its surface 
broken by the eddies of the making tide, or the occa- 
sional splash of a leaping salmon. Across the straits on 
the Mainland, the tops of the great mountains clothed 
with eternal snow were lit up a rose-pink by the rays of 
the setting sun. I have seldom seen a more beautiful 
scene, or one which gave such a deep sense of peace."

THE DIAL 



[August 16, 



"It has been said by someone," says Mr. 
William Brooks Cabot, "that all the places 
now unexplored were so miserably bad that no 
one would care to have anything to do with 
them." Mr. Cabot found the caribou country 
of northeastern Labrador not a bad region to 
wander in, and the natives well worth visiting. 
These two motives the call of the wilderness, 
and especially the unexplored wilderness, and 
the fascinating study of a race still in almost its 
primitive state drew Mr. Cabot to Labrador 
year after year between 1904 and 1910, and 
furnished the very interesting material which 
he has embodied in his book. He has not only 
given us a great deal of really valuable infor- 
mation as to the geography of a little-known 
region, but he has brought together much that 
was new as to the character and customs of the 
Indians of Labrador, " a little group of a race 
high in personality, yet living substantially in 
the pre-Columbian age of the continent," and 
he has added materially to what was known of 
the fauna of that region. Incidentally, he 
speaks feelingly and eloquently of the numbers, 
enterprise, and penetrating qualities of the 
Labrador mosquito. But perhaps more than 
all else he is filled with the lure, the charm of 
wild places, and he is able to bring much of it 
home to his readers. In taking leave of the 
bleak, inhospitable land, which nevertheless he 
had found so full of interest and fascination, he 
says: 

" It was a time of reckoning for me, the turning over 
of what had been in my Labrador years the stringing 
of beads that should always a little shine. Some of 
these had seemed clouded in the gathering, but in 
the reverie of those final days they were lighted all. 
Though never the world again were young, there had 
been days. Coast and inland inland and coast. The 
early hard days on the mainland, the hills and valleys 
alone, the calm of the noble bays; their silence, broken 
only by the rise of wings; Tuh-pungiuk and Un'sekat 
and Opetik; and the strong opposing sea. The rolling 
barrens, the hills of the height of land. The tall, grave 
people there, the smiling strong ones here; the aurora 
and the bergs and the innumerable insect foe. Long 
days and twilight nights, dark nights and stormy days ; 
the sunshine on the sea and the white-backed eiders' 
charge. So my string was strung. Always for me now 
would return the gray barrens, stretching far and on, 
always the lakes and the lodge-smokes on their shores. 
Always would the people watch the deer, always stand 
silent at the shore, as friends would wave as they go; 
the land be ever theirs. The light that has been never 
quite fails the wilderness traveller; his feet may remain 
afar, but his mind returns 

' Where the caribou are standing: 
On the gilded hills of morning, 
Where the white moss meets the footstep 
And the way is long before.'" 



Dr. Hutton's book, " Among the Eskimos of 
Labrador," is a rare interpretation of a most 
interesting type of mankind the Eskimo of 
the Moravian Missions. One feels instinct- 
ively, without knowing anything more of him 
than is revealed in his book, that Dr. Hutton 
is very much such a man as Dr. Grenfell 
strong, manly, sympathetic, gifted with plenty 
of common-sense, with the elusive quality that 
wins confidence everywhere, and with that salt 
that adds a savor to every character, redeeming 
the mean or poor, enriching the good, human- 
izing the great the saving gift of humor. 
That he can also write a book that is worth 
while, we now have evidence. He has indeed 
given us something that will live when thou- 
sands of contemporary books have been for- 
gotten. And this is not because his book has 
any marked literary charm, or elaborates any 
particular theory of human conduct ; but rather 
because it is a true, simple, and direct narrative 
of the life of a good and strong man, and of the 
child-like people to whom he ministered. Dr. 
Hutton has shown us the inner life of the 
Eskimo, and his real personality the life and 
personality which are hidden from the casual vis- 
itor to the Labrador ; he has shown us his home, 
his family, the things that are vital to him, his 
outlook upon his own small world and the mys- 
terious beyond ; and he has succeeded in making 
the Eskimo of Hebron and Nain and Raman 
and Okak an altogether likable personality. 

Dr. Hutton's book is one that lends itself 
peculiarly to quotation. In fact, it is in this 
respect embarrassing to the reviewer. One finds 
so much that would bear repeating, that it is 
difficult to pick and choose. The building of 
the hospital was a great event at Okak, and 
brought a curious medley of patients. Says 
Dr. Hutton: 

" I remember how old Rebekah came one day, nurs- 
ing a wounded hand. She is one of the stateliest of the 
village grandmothers, an active old woman of sixty-five, 
with her teeth nearly worn to the gums; but, old as she 
is, she is well able to take an oar in a boat or a pair, 
for the matter of that and thinks nothing of trudging 
to and from the woods, five miles away, to fetch broken 
branches to replenish her stove. With proper Eskimo 
dignity she came in and sat down, and composed herself 
to tell her tale; and all the while she was hugging her 
left hand, swathed in a red bandanna handkerchief. 

"'I was making boots just now,' she said, 'and the 
leather-knife slipped and cut my thumb. Ai-ai, it 
bled very much, and it was nearly cut off; but I had 
my boot-needle threaded with isalo (reindeer-sinew), 
and I sewed my thumb with that, so that it no longer 
bleeds; and now I have come to let you bind it up.' And 
there and then the old woman unwrapped her handker-

chief and displayed her hand, with a long wound neatly 
sewed up, stitch upon stitch, in proper bootmaker's style. 
" This serves to illustrate the native indifference to 
pain; and even in the worst of sufferings their attitude 
is the same. I have seen them, men and women, in 
dingy little huts and in leaky calico tents, lying on rough 
beds of moss and reindeer skins, silent and uncomplain- 
ing, though their faces were blanched and the beads of 
perspiration stood out under the strain of physical suf- 
fering. The very thought calls forth one's sympathy; 
and the pictures that crowd before me as I write pic- 
tures of people toiling up the steps of the new hospital, 
with the marks of pain on their faces and a dumb and 
eager hopefulness shining in their eyes has left an 
impression on my mind that time will never efface. A 
strangely attractive folk: with children's fears and child- 
hood's quaint ideas, and childhood's whims and fancies 
and unreasoning demands, but with a manly bravery in 
the face of pain or danger, and a manly mastery of the 
terrible rigours of their daily work, that call for admir- 
ation." 

On another occasion, Dr. Hutton was in 
Nain, and an urgent message came from Okak 
that a boy had been brought in to the hospital 
with a compound fracture. It was important to 
go at once, but the dogs were out of condition, 
and a bad storm was coming up. The old 
Eskimo schoolmaster urged him not to attempt 
the journey. "You will all be lost," he said. 

" His concern was real, so I called my drivers. 'What 
do you say?' I asked them. 'Are you willing to go?' 

" ' Illale ' (of course), they said. ' Ready,' said I, ' go 
ahead.' The dogs slowly raised themselves on their 
legs, and whined as they trotted along the bumpy path 
toward the sea-ice; and the heavy wrack of the north- 
ern storm came bowling along to meet us. < Aksuse! ' 
shouted the people, ' be strong ' ; and we waved our hands 
and shouted back. Then they began to sing. 

" There is a lump in my throat and a mist in my eyes 
even now, when I think of that scene : just a crowd of 
rough Eskimos, people whose grandfathers had been 
heathen and wild, singing a hymn of 'God-speed as we 
set out on our dangerous errand. 

" ' Takkotigelfirminiptingnut 
Gude illagilisetSk,' 

they sang, and the charmingly balanced harmony came 
fainter and ever fainter as the wind began to sigh about 
us and the snow to beat on our faces. ' God be with 
you till we meet again,'- -and we settled confidently 
to our task." 

It is one of many interesting points brought 
out in Dr. Hutton's narrative, that the Eskimos, 
although they have no native music, no tradi- 
tional tunes, no folk-songs of their own, have a 
natural taste for music, with good voices and 
an instinctive feeling for harmony. Jerry the 
native Okak organist, is described as a really 
clever musician, with a remarkable command of 
several instruments besides his organ; while 
Nathaniel, the Nain schoolmaster, one of the 
most cultured of the Eskimos, has composed 
an anthem in four parts, which was sung by the 
Eskimo choir. Dr. Hutton concludes : 



" I lay my pen aside with my mind still full of the 
memories that are so vivid to me. Brown, smiling 
faces pass before me; familiar names sound in my ears; 
bright eyes look into mine; musical voices sing outside 
my window; gruff shouts echo as the boys come sliding 
down the hill; Jerry and his bandsmen march along, 
waking the village with their trumpet notes; the poor 
girl on the bed of reindeer skins whispers her ' Nako- 
mek ' (how thankful) ; the crowd on the slope of the 
frozen beach sings me off into the storm; the voice of 
little Johannes calls aboye the whining of the dog ; and 
as I bid adieu to my neighbours the Eskimos, I pass on 
to my reader the noble old greeting that I heard so 
often ' Aksunai.'" 

One or two quotations such as these can give 
but a very inadequate idea of what is really a 
remarkable narrative; but they may at least 
serve to suggest the character of the author, and 
of the curious little community clinging so ten- 
aciously to its rocky and desolate-looking home 
on the extreme north-eastern coast of America.

Two MERCHANT MARINERS OF 
SINGAPORE.* 



May a kindly fate deliver our descendants 
from stale and flat uniformity of language, 
dress, and manners, in all regions of the earth. 
Though few nooks and corners of the world are 
still unvisited by the prying eyes of the explorer 
and the glob-trotter, we are yet free from that 
uniformity which seems to threaten the twenty- 
first century. The polar regions are to-day 
sternly alluring to bold hearts. There are re- 
gions of Asia and Africa still unexplored. And 
the perennial fascination of the peculiar and the 
picturesque still inheres in the less forward na- 
tions of the world. That special sort of romance 
belonging to the story of the adventurous trader 
in far seas and remote lands bids fair soon to 
vanish in the presence of steamship, railway, 
and other universal levellers, but it has thus far 
not quite disappeared. Just because it is about 
to die out of the world, we take added delight 
in present-day instances of merchant-mariner's 
romance. 

A most interesting example is the life-story 
of John Dill Ross and his son and namesake, 
traders in the Indian Ocean from the early 
decades of the nineteenth century almost until 
the present. "Sixty Years' Life and Adven- 
ture in the Orient" professes to be an account 
of the life of Captain John Dillon Northwood 
and of that of his son up to his retirement from

the oriental trade ; but the modest disguise does 
not conceal the true persons, Captain Ross and 
the author, Mr. John Dill Ross, now of London. 
Beginning with a history of the British influence 
in Borneo in the person of that remarkable 
Rajah Brooke, the book relates in vivid and 
always entertaining manner the life-story of 
Captain Northwood from his birth on an island 
in the China Sea, his schooling in the home of 
a clergyman in Australia, his marriage and first 
romantic sea-venture a voyage in a diminutive 
sailing vessel from the China Sea to Australia 
through his merchant career as trader and ship- 
owner doing business between Borneo, the Moluc- 
cas, and Singapore. After the death of Captain 
Northwood the son continued his father's career 
through a number of years filled with pictur- 
esque experiences, until he was stricken down by 
deadly tropical fever and invalided home. The 
story of the elder North wood's career never flags 
in entertainment. He was a man fit to have 
sailed with Drake in pursuit of Spanish gal- 
leons, bold, quick-witted, ready in emergency, 
persistent always till he gained his prize. But 
his personality is delightful not because of these 
traits alone, but by reason of their constant asso- 
ciation with generosity, fair-mindedness, and the 
manners of a gentleman. The story is replete 
with episodes of keen interest or amusement, and 
the shrewd and magnanimous Captain always 
proves equal to the occasion, whether it be fight- 
ing pirates without killing any if he could 
avoid it or gracefully getting rid of the viva- 
cious wife of a Dutch planter and capitalist 
after Captain Northwood had sailed away from 
Borneo, unaware that the lady had been rendered 
drowsy by wine, and, instead of accompanying 
her lord and his party off the ship, had remained 
asleep on a lounge in the saloon. The Captain 
develops, as the story proceeds, into an admir- 
able personification of the best British virtues, 
and the biographer wins the sympathy of the 
reader for the tough and yet tender old sea- 
man when his large fortune is suddenly lost, 
and holds an ever deepening interest to the end 
of his heroic and honorable struggle to restore 
the loss. 

The story of the author's own career in the 
Orient is also entertaining, but it lacks the two 
elements of interest inhering in that of the 
father remoteness in time and picturesque 
character. Indeed, it might have been wiser to 
make two books instead of two volumes. The 
unity of each would have been more satisfac- 
tory, and the antique nature of the first would 
not have detracted from the modern quality of 



the second. As the two volumes, however, are 
easy reading, one can heartily commend the 
story to summer readers in the mountains, and 
especially by the sea, with which it is so intim- 
ately concerned. O< D> WANNAMAKER. 



ATHENS IN DECLINE.* 



Historians of Greece usually close their nar- 
rative with the death of Alexander the Great 
(323 B.C.), the date from which foreign influ- 
ence began to work more and more powerfully 
in Hellas until the over-lordship of Rome was 
clinched by the capture of Corinth by the con- 
sul Mummius (146 B. c.) and the sack of Athens 
by Sulla (86 B.C.). This intervening period of 
nearly two centuries was, for Athens particu- 
larly, marked by a steady decline in military and 
political prestige. We see the once imperial city 
coquetting with the various successors of Alex- 
ander, surrendering item after item of her ma- 
terial strength, and retaining only the intellectual 
and artistic primacy of which neither Antioch nor 
Alexandria nor Pergamon could deprive her. 

In Professor Ferguson's substantial volume on 
" The Hellenistic Commonwealth," this transfor- 
mation of the city-state Athens into a municipal- 
ity under tyrannical and imperial rule is traced 
with much industry and learning, and with 
great minuteness of detail. He objects to the 
dictum of Freeman that "we owe it to the great- 
ness of Athens to study the story of her miser- 
able fall," and insists that " no one would now 
think of approaching a book on Hellenistic 
Athens to discover the secret of Athenian de- 
cline. . . that the fate of Athens was settled 
by the Peloponnesian war. . . and that who- 
ever believes with Freeman that history is first 
of all past politics must no longer look for the 
supreme crisis in Athenian affairs after Alexan- 
der's time." Hence the compelling interest of 
the Hellenistic period will attach to the above- 
mentioned transformation and to the social 
and economic conditions which grew out of it. 
Athens was still, and increasingly, the centre 
of culture ; but with politics reduced to a futil- 
ity, our attention is fastened on the changes in 
thought and life which now became manifest. 
The revelations of the New Comedy the 
comedy of manners show with painful mon- 
otony how latent or subterranean features of 
Athenian life were brought to the surface with 
tropical rapidity under the tyrannies of the two

Demetrii (of Phalerum and Poliorcetes). In- 
stead of a Xenophon or a Thucydides we have 
the plays of Menander or the ' Characters ' of 
Theophrastus as our guides through the "far- 
rago of Attic life." 

But the nobler side of the Attic genius is not 
neglected ; and to Professor Ferguson we owe 
a luminous description of the four great schools 
of philosophic thought Plato's Academy, 
Aristotle's Peripatos, Epicurus's Garden, and 
Zeno's Porch; as well as of their successive 
periods of influence, when philosophers like 
Xenocrates andCarneades (the "pragmatist/>ar 
excellence ") were placed at the head of dip- 
lomatic embassies, and ideal systems of thought 
were appealed to for practical guidance.. 

A vivid though somewhat sketchy picture of 
the Athens of 200 B. c. is afforded in an extract 
from the "Notes on Greek Cities" of Hera- 
cleides the Critic, cited at some length by Profes- 
sor Ferguson, but too long for the reproduction 
of more than a sentence or two. 

" The Athenians are great-souled, simple in their man- 
ners, reliable custodians of friendship. Some informers 
run about in the city, harassing wealthy visitors; but 
should the people catch them, theirs would be a hard 
fate. The genuine Athenians are keen art critics, and 
unwearying patrons of plays, concerts, and lectures. In 
a word, Athens surpasses other cities in all that makes 
for the enjoyment and betterment of life, by as much 
as other cities surpass the country." 

Professor Ferguson's summary of the whole pas- 
sage is suggestive. 

"Athens is neither lawless, provincial, nor romantic. 
She has high-minded gentlemen and a waspish populace ; 
a constant round of gaiety and ever- threatening hunger; 
mean, dusty streets and noble public buildings; good 
taste and critical acumen; crowds of foreigners, busy 
schools of philosophers, and, implicit in all else, the 
blessings of peace." 

Most informing, perhaps, is the chapter on 
the relations of Athens and Delos. The famous 
little island, home of the worship of Apollo and 
Artemis, was secured to Athens by the estab- 
lishment, in 166 B. c., of an Athenian cleruchy, 
or colony. To the islet's religious importance 
was now added commercial prosperity; but the 
masterful Romans soon interfered, dissolved the 
Athenian cleruchy, and took over the adminis- 
tration of Delian affairs. The result was to 
make Delos entirely cosmopolitan. Then was 
seen, in greater measure than ever, that curious 
intrusion of strange Oriental cults on the "pure" 
Hellenic faiths. On the little area of about 
three square miles, Apollo and Artemis found 
themselves crowded by Sabazius, Osiris, Astarte, 
Serapis, and Isis. In the elucidation of these 



matters Professor Ferguson has been greatly 
aided by the work of the French scholars who 
have been working at Delos for the past forty 
years. 

The author has made excellent use of the orig- 
inal and secondary sources the great corpora 
of inscriptions, the writings of Menander, Poly- 
bius, Plutarch, and Pausanias, as well as of all 
modern scholars who have dealt with Hellenistic 
themes. Citations occupy a portion of almost 
every page, and make the book an admirable 
directory for students of the period. There is a 
general bibliography, an excursus on the instru- 
ments of Athenian government, and a satisfac- 
tory index. The latter affords an opportunity 
for correcting a twice-repeated misprint ; others 
might be mentioned on pages 63, 328, 414, 

and 438.

IM THE JUNGLES OF TROPICAL, 
AMERICA.* 



The rapid increase of automobiles in civilized 
countries in the last decade has tremendously en- 
larged the consumption of rubber, advanced its 
price, and stimulated the search for new sources 
of the crude gum and the fuller exploitation of 
known fields of production. The effort to find 
by synthetic chemistry an adequate substitute 
which is commercially available has thus far 
failed. 

As a pebble thrown into a pond creates rip- 
ples which in ever- widening circles press toward 
the remoter parts and reach finally every nook 
and corner, so the demand for rubber has carried 
the civilization of today into the most distant 
parts of the tropics, diluted, weakened, distorted, 
but still effective in shaping the activities and 
directing the daily life of the remotest savage 
tribe, and taking here, as in furnace and factory, 
its toll of human lives. 

To what an extent the demand for rubber has 
developed commerce, opened the jungle, carried 
men of force and education as well as the trader 
and the half-civilized native into the tropical 
wilderness of the head-waters of the Amazon, 
may be gathered from a perusal of Mr. Algot 
Lange's "In the Amazon Jungle." Through 
steamers run from Iquitos in Peru down the 
Amazon to New York and during the rainy

season Mr. Lange assures us that the " Maure- 
tania" could sail up this great river to Remate 
de Males at the Peruvian frontier. During this 
season immense tracts of the tropical jungle are 
under water, and fevers, the omnipresent mala- 
ria, the fatal yellow fever, and the mysterious 
beri-beri, rule the land. 

In common with frontier towns in our own 
land, Remate de Males ("Culmination of Evils") 
and its Peruvian neighbor, Nazareth, are deco- 
rated, when not submerged, with a motley array 
of tin cans of American origin and empty bot- 
tles from all nations. The rubber gatherer is 
handsomely paid, even by our standards, and 
the jungle traders see to it that his wages are 
quickly spent. With American foods go some 
of our modern inventions, the inevitable gramo- 
phone, and even, on remote jungle paths in the 
native huts perched high in the trees, the Amer- 
ican sewing machine! 

The author penetrated the remote jungle, with 
an exploring party sent out by one of the larger 
rubber "estates " in search of new forests to tap, 
or to ruthlessly fell, as is sometimes done. The 
expedition was a fatal one, fever, beri-beri, and 
deadly snakes claiming their victims, till alone 
in his delirium the author fell in with a commu- 
nity of the savage Mangeroma cannibals who 
nursed him back to health, taught him their lan- 
guage and customs, and even took him with them 
on an ambush for a party of raiding Peruvian 
rubber gatherers who furnished the piece de 
resistance at the feast which folio wed the victory. 
Armed only with poison darts and blow guns, 
war clubs and spears, they overcame and com- 
pletely destroyed the party armed with firearms. 
This novel experience convinced our author that 
"our earth has not been reduced to a dead level 
of drab and commonplace existence, and that 
somewhere in the remote parts of the world are 
still to be found people who have never seen or 
heard of white men." 

It is an extremely interesting picture which is 
here portrayed of the life in the frontier rubber 
trading-post and in the tambos of the darkened 
trails through the dense tropical jungle, of the 
life of stream and forests, of pungent rubber 
smudges, and of gold to be picked up till all 
the negative boxes are rilled, only to be thrown 
away again in the delirious race with hunger and 
fever back toward the outposts of civilization. 

The book is well written and handsomely illus- 
trated with unique photographs of the Amazon 
jungle.

RECENT POETRY.* 



A noteworthy literary phenomenon is that pro- 
vided by the novelists who have turned poets or, to 
speak more exactly, by the writers who, after achiev- 
ing success as novelists, have surprised their readers 
by the revelation of a marked poetic faculty. That 
one must have something of this faculty to be a 
writer of enduring fiction is a thesis that has often 
been maintained ; and it is not surprising, when we 
come to think of it, that so many novelists have won 
no mean measure of success in the production of 
verse. Scott and Meredith are the striking exam- 
ples in English literature, although in their cases the 
poetic gift was the first to be revealed. Both Thack- 
eray and Dickens were poets, of a sort; and even 
more distinctly so were George Eliot, Bulwer, the 
Bronte* Sisters, Kingsley, and Blackmore. In more 
recent years, Mr. Thomas Hardy has provided con- 
firmation of the thesis in question, both by assert- 
ing the principle and by illustrating it in practice. 
"The Dynasts" will, we firmly believe, come to be 
regarded as one of his most significant works, and 
many of his shorter poems have a grip and a vitality 
that will prevent them from being forgotten. Amer- 
ican examples are Poe, Harte, Mr. Howells, and Mr. 

A. S. Hardy. The Germans and Scandinavians rec- 
ognize the principle instinctively by failing to pro- 
vide in their vocabularies words which are restricted 
in their meaning to compositions metrical in form. 
Dichtung and Digtning mean imaginative writing 
of any sort, prose or verse; the name Dlchter be- 
longs as fully to Hauptman and Sudermann as it 
does to Goethe and Schiller; and both BjOrnson 
and Ibsen would be known as Digter if they had 
never written a page in measure and rhyme. 

Quite a number of present-day English novelists 
are now essaying the poetical form. Mr. Maurice 
Hewlett and Sir Arthur Doyle have recently en- 
gaged our attention, and now come Mr. John Mase- 
field and Mr. John Galsworthy with volumes of 
poetry in the restricted sense which the English lan- 
guage attaches to the word. Mr. Masefield's offering

consists of two narrative rhymed poems of arresting 
quality, "The Everlasting Mercy" and "The Widow 
in the Bye Street." We must admit that they are 
tracts as well as poems, and that their obtrusively 
didactic quality is against them as literary produc- 
tions. One is the tale of a drunken ruffian who gets 
evangelistic religion by the process of "conversion" 
made familiar by "revivalist" meetings and other 
illustrations of " corybantic Christianity." The other 
is a brutal tale of lust and crime, telling how an 
English peasant lad is ensnared by a light woman, 
and is impelled by jealousy to commit a murder for 
which he is quite properly hanged. Mr. Masefield 
enlists our sympathy for both of these degenerates, 
and would seemingly have us believe that they are 
not beyond the pale of either human or divine for- 
giveness. He enforces this teaching by making both 
poems reek with sentimentality, and by a rather 
nauseous blend of religious symbolism with plain 
speech. Saul Kane, the ruffian of "The Everlasting 
Mercy," has been marking his carousings with such 
discourse as this: 

" Come on, drinks round, salue, drink hearty, 
Now, Jane, the punch-bowl for the party. 
If any here won't drink with me 
I '11 knock his bloody eyes out. See ? 
Come on, cigars round, rum for mine, 
Sing us a smutty song, some swine," 

which is a comparatively restrained specimen of his 
reported speech, when the reproaches of a Quaker 
missionary sink into his soul, and he rushes out into 
the night filled with such thoughts as these : 

" glory of the lighted mind, 
How dead I 'd been, how dumb, how blind. 
The station brook, to my new eyes, 
Was babbling out of Paradise, 
The waters rushing from the rain 
Were singing Christ has risen again. 
I thought all earthly creatures knelt 
From rapture of the joy I felt. 
The narrow station-wall's brick ledge, 
The wild hop withering in the hedge, 
The light in huntsman's upper storey 
Were parts of an eternal glory, 
Were God's eternal garden flowers. 
I stood in bliss at this for hours.'' 

It is sentimentally and even dramatically effective, 
but we are afraid that it is not good psychology. 
Before his "conversion," Saul has a colloquy with 
the parson, which might have come straight from 
Ibsen's " Brand," so exactly does it reproduce the 
terse rhythm, the argumentative manner, and the 
fiery indignation of that great poem. Says Saul: 

" The English church both is and was 
A subsidy of Caiaphas. 
I do n't believe in Prayer nor Bible, 
They 're all lies through, and you 've a libel, 
A libel on the Devil's plan 
When first he miscreated man. 
You mumble through a formal code 
To get which martyrs burned and glowed. 
I look on martyrs as mistakes, 
But still they burned for it at stakes ; 
Your only fire 's the jolly fire 
Where you can guzzle port with Squire, 
And back and praise his damned opinions, 
About his temporal dominions." 



The parson's rejoinder is in the following strain: 

" States are not made, nor patched ; they grow, 
Grow slow through centuries of pain 
And grow correctly in the main, 
But only grow by certain laws 
Of certain bits in certain jaws. 
You want to doctor that. Let be 
You cannot patch a growing tree. 
Put these two words beneath your hat, 
These two: securus judicat. 

To get the whole world out of bed, 

And washed, and dressed, and warmed, and fed, 

To work, and back to bed again, 

Believe me, Saul, costs worlds of pain. 

Then as to whether true or sham 

That book of Christ, whose priest I am ; 

The Bible is a lie, say you, 

Where do you stand, suppose it true ? 

Good-bye. But if you 've more to say, 

My doors are open night and day. 

Meanwhile, my friend, 't would be no sin 

To mix more water in your gin. 

We 're neither saints nor Philip Sidneys, 

But mortal men with mortal kidneys." 

It sounds like a parody of the dialogues between 
Brand and the mayor. These narratives by Mr. 
Masefield are virile, slapdash stuff, but it is only in 
spots that they deserve to be glorified with the name 
of poetry, and the streaks of deep feeling and im- 
aginative power do not fuse with the sordid matrix 
of realism. 

Mr. Galsworthy speaks to us with the accent of 
the authentic poet, albeit he chooses the modest 
style of " Moods, Songs, and Doggerels " for his 
title. Now a large part of Mr. Masefield's volume 
must be described as doggerel, but this seems too 
harsh a term even for Mr. Galsworthy's trifles. 
Such lines as these, surely, deserve a gentler name : 

"Life? What is Life? 
The leaping up of level wave ; 
The flaring of an ashy fire ; 
The living wind in airless grave ! 

" Death ? What is Death ? 
The dying of immortal sun ; 
The sleeping of the sleepless moon ; 
The end of story not begun !" 

"Love" is the title of the following poignant distillate 
from the alembic of experience: 

" Love ! that love which comes so stealthily, 
And takes us up, and twists us as it will 
What fever'd hours of agony you bring I 
How oft we wake and cry : ' God set me free 
Of love to never love again ! ' And still 
We fall, and clutch you by the knees, and cling 
And press our lips and so, once more are glad ! 

" And if you go, or if you never come, 
Through what a grieving wilderness of pain 
We travel on ! In prisons stripped of light 
We blindly grope, and wander without home. 
The friendless winds that sweep across the plain 
The beggars meeting us at silent night 
Than we, are not more desolate and sad!" 

The lines called "Errantry" give voice to an ideal- 
ism which never fails the poet who has the true

conception of his mission as an inspiring interpreter 
of life. 

" Come ! Let us lay a crazy lance in rest, 
And tilt at windmills under a wild sky ! 
For who would live so petty and unblest 
That dare not tilt at something ere he die 
Rather than, screened by safe majority, 
Preserve his little life to little ends, 
And never raise a rebel battle-cry ! 

" Ah ! for the weapon wistful and sublime, 
Whose lifted point recks naught of woe or weal, 
Since Fate demands it shivered every time ! 
When in the wildness of our charge we reel 
Men laugh indeed the sweeter heavens smile, 
For all the world of fat prosperity 
Has not the value of that broken steel!" 

One thinks of innumerable parallels to th,is expres- 
sion of lofty thought from Lowell, Sill, Arnold, 
Dobson, and many others but of none more per- 
suasive and sincere. Mr. Galsworthy is not alone 
a poet of abstract ideas, as the indignant lines en- 
titled "Persia Moritura " may testify. 

" Home of the free ! Protector of the weak ! 
Shall We and this Great Grey Ally make sand 
Of all a nation's budding green, and wreak 
Our winter will on that unhappy land ? 
Is all our steel of soul disolved and flown ? 
Have fumes of fear encased our heart of flame ? 
Are we with panic so deep-rotted down 
In self, that we can feel no longer shame 
To league, and steal a nation's hope of youth ? 
Oh ! Sirs ! Is our Star merely cynical ? 
Is God reduced ? That we must darken truth, 
And break our honour with this creeping fall ? 

" Is Freedom but a word a flaring boast ? 
Is Self-Concern horizon's utter sun ? 
If so To-day let England die, and ghost 
Through all her godless history to come ! 
If, Sirs, the faith of men be Force alone, 
Let us ring down The farce is nothing worth. 
If Life be only prayer to things of stone, 
Come Death ! And let us, friends, go mocking forth ! 
But if there's aught, in all Time's bloody hours, 
Of Justice, if the herbs of Pity grow 
O Native Land, let not those only flowers 
Of God be desert-strewn and withered now!" 

If the crime against Persia be finally consummated 
by England's connivance with the monstrous des- 
potism of the Muscovite, these lines at least will 
remain to show that the hideous wrong was not ac- 
complished without a protest. 

"Charmides and Other Poems Chiefly Relating 
to Oxford" is an exquisite volume of verse by Mr. 
Gascoigne Mackie. The titular piece, pictorial and 
elegiac, consists of sixteen verse sections, in three 
groups of sixteen each, invoking the spirit of "Char- 
, mides " with an appeal to old-time memories. We 
quote one of the most beautiful of these sections. 

"Long gaps of lingering splendour but no sun 
Now from the heights the hieratic tints 
Fade slowly, like the fervour from life's dream : 
And every valley veiled in violet bloom 
Lies hushed ; till lo, from out her vestal shrine 
Heaven's inmost penetralia of peace 
Upon the bosom of maternal night 
Passionless Hesper, like a kneeling child, 
Glimmers : and soft as dew, the far off hills 



Drop down divine nostalgia on my soul 
That homeward turns at last. 

Dear Charmides, 

Still be thou near me, wheresoe'er I walk, 
The motive and the charm of solitude : 
Close as a shadow let thy memory cling 
And deepen round me ; till the shadows break 
And on the golden bough the thrush begins." 

An earlier version of this poem was published in 
1898, but it has now been re-written. The same 
subdued strain of reflection characterizes the other 
poems of this collection. These stanzas come from 
" Oxford at Night." 

" Austere she stood in ancient times, 

A refuge for the pure in heart, 
And still the music of her chimes 
Peals from a world apart. 

" And when we hear those cloister'd bells 

After long years, or absence long, 
With what high hopes and proud farewells 
Their haunting echoes throng ! 

" Until it seems as if she brings 

(To mock the pride of lonely men), 
Only the tears of mortal things 

That cloud our mortal ken." 

Mr. Mackie has both technical skill and the gift of 
subtle harmonies of word and thought. His work 
is the expression of a temperament finely attuned 
to spiritual beauty. 

These little books of verse that so frequently come 
to us from Oxford are apt to be pleasant surprises, 
revealing talents deserving of a wider fame than 
they are likely ever to win. We always open them 
with pleasant anticipations, and are rarely disap- 
pointed. Mr. Brett-Smith's " Poems of the North " 
are not, for the most part, upon Oxonian themes, 
but reveal instead a spirit that ventures far afield, 
notably into the realm of Scandinavian legend and 
mythology. This is "The Steering Song of Olaf 
Tryggvason." 

" Kinar. see : 
Rush of waves in the sloping sea 

Flying, flying swift and free ! 
Oegir's daughters, lest they charm 

To their harm. 

Hearts of all the men who roam 
On the swan's path of the deep 
Down from rugged lands and steep, 
Veil their heads in white sea foam. 

" Einar, hear : 
Storm winds gathering far and near 

Sweep the spume from the fretting mere ! 
Through the shrouds the breezes ring, 

Whirr and sing, 
Like the hiss of an arrow's flight 

When the quivering bows are bent afar 
And through the hush of the breaking war 
Warriors' eyes are dimmed in night." 

These lines on "The Death of Colonel Brett," an 
Elizabethan seaman slain in Portugal, and presum- 
ably one of the author's ancestors, are singularly 
impressive. 

" Nay, lad, 'tis mortal : do not weep, but mark, 
I will not lie among these Portingales 
The sea being ours ; take me a fishing barque

The fleet rides anchored under Cascais walls 

Bid Drake remember when we both were hale : 

He shall not grudge for old felicity, 

A pair of shot and some poor yards of sail. 

Ah, vesperascit ! like a spreading tree 

The dusk surrounds me with a thousand leaves 

And some red berries, which are bright with pain : 

My God ! I shall not see the yellow sheaves 

In England, nor hear ousel sing again 

Only the seamen crying, as she cleaves 

Far overhead the shadowy restless main." 

The opening lines of "Peace" may be taken to 
illustrate the somewhat abstract and cloudy versi- 
fying of Mr. James Mackereth, as exhibited in the 
volume entitled "In the Wake of the Phoenix." 

" Mute spouse of God, upon whose bosom lies 
Time like a child, time of the fevered heart, 
Out of this moment of mortality 
Toward thee, O mild Unchangeable, we lift 
Our hands, our faces rmitable uplift, 
Like waves that turn their pallor to the moon, 
And plead in passing for thy kiss, Peace. 

Sage dweller on the sacred frontiers 

Of realms the armoured years shall enter not, 

Aloof from all the clangorous march of time, 

From riot, and the ravishments of men, 

0, patient listener to the Innermost, 

Flow from the noiseless places of the world I 

From the deep valleys 'mid a thousand hills 

Where silence sits forever 'mong her rocks 

Poring upon impermanence, flow thence, 

Flow from all haunted places where abides 

The hush primeval." 

And so on, for some two hundred lines. 

This Emersonian jingle introduces " The Hill of 
Vision," by Mr. James Stephens : 

" Everything that I can spy 
Through the circle of my eye, 
Everything that I can see 
Has been woven out of me ; 
I have sown the stars, and threw 
Clouds of morning and of eve 
Up into the vacant blue ; 
Everything that I perceive, 
Sun and sea and mountain high, 
All are moulded by my eye : 
Closing it, what shall I find ? 
Darkness, and a little wind." 

It is spiritual and imaginative vision, rather than 
physical, that Mr. Stephens prefers to impart. 
This is his view of what shall be in "The Fulness 
of Time." 

" On a rusty iron throne 
Past the furthest star of space 
I saw Satan sit alone, 
Old and haggard was his face 
For his work was done and he 
Rested in eternity. 

" And to him from out the sun 
Came his father and his friend 
Saying, now the work is done 
Enmity is at an end : 
And he guided Satan to 
Paradises that he knew. 

" Gabriel without a frown, 
Uriel without a spear, 
Raphael came singing down 



Welcoming their ancient peer. 
And they seated him beside 
One who had been crucified.'' 

Mr. John G. Neihardt is master of a rugged dic- 
tion, marked by forceful metaphors and a somewhat 
recondite allusiveness. His meaning is not always 
clear, and seems to be expressive of an emotional 
state rather than of an imaginative vision. Many 
of the pieces in "The Stranger at the Gate" are 
nature lyrics, not so much descriptive as interpreta- 
tive in a spiritual sense. This, for example: 

" Over the steep cloud-crags 
The marching day went down 
Bickering spears and flags, 
Slant in a wind of Doom ! 
Blear in the huddled shadows 
Glimmer the lights of the town ; 
Black pools mottle the meadows, 
Swamped in a purple gloom. 

" Is it the night wind sobbing 
Over the wheat in head ? 
Is it the world-heart throbbing 
Sad with the coming years ? 
Is it the lifeward creeping 
Ghosts of the myriad dead, 
Livid with wounds and weeping 
Wild, uncleansing tears ? " 

Of course it is not any of these things, but the poet 
is licensed to suggest them, for his revelation is not 
of nature, but of his own soul. We are much im- 
pressed with "The Poet's Town," describing the 
boy who is at heart a poet, living his own life amid 
commonplace surroundings. 

" Rich with the dreamer's pillage, 
An idle and worthless lad, 
Least in a prosy village, 
And prince in Allahabad ; 

" Lover of golden apples, 
Munching a daily crust ; 
Haunter of dream-built chapels, 
Worshipping in the dust ; 

" Dull to the worldly duty, 
Less to the town he grew, 
And more to the God of Beauty 
Than even the grocer knew !" 

Indignation at the present scheme of things in 
America, and the cry for social justice, are voiced 
in the poems at the close of the volume. 

" No longer blindfold Justice reigns ; but leers 
A barefaced, venal strumpet in her stead ! 
The stolen harvests of a hundred years 
Are lighter than a stolen loaf of bread ! 

" pious Nation, holding God in awe, 
Where sacred human rights are duly priced ! 
Where men are beggared in the name of Law, 
Where alms are given in the name of Christ ! 

" The Country of the Free ! wretched lie I 
The Country of the Brave Yea, let it be 1 
One more good fight, O Brothers, ere we die 
And this shall be the Country of the Free!" 

The freedom here invoked seems to be freedom to 
pillage the possessors under the mob-banner of 
socialism. "The Red Wind Comes," from which we 
have quoted, and the " Cry of the People," which 
follows it, are quite in the vein of William Morris.

THE DIAL 



[August 16, 



" I am in poetry what Strauss is in music, Rodin 
in sculpture, and Stuck in painting a cerebral 
impressionist." "I have found myself as a poet." 
" My own emotions are too elusive and too complex 
to be capable of expression or understanding beyond 
where I have gone. If I lived in Europe, if mine 
were the freedom of Wedekind and the audience 
that hails him and goads him, I might still go on. 
But I realize that I am too far ahead of the pageant 
of American life to go one step further." "The 
torch of our lyric fire still burns and will continue 
to burn when it has passed from my hands into 
those of a younger poet." " I have given a new lyric 
impetus to my country. I have loosened the tongue 
of the young American poets." "I may safely say 
that I am one of the leaders of the lyric insurgents 
who, inheriting the technique of Poe and the social 
conscience of Whitman, have added the new note of 
passion." " I am perhaps the only American poet 
whose book of lyric verse made money for himself 
and his publishers." These are excerpts from the 
lengthy introduction to "The Candle and the Flame," 
Mr. George Sylvester Viereck's new book of poems. 
Their incredible egotism is very amusing when we 
realize upon how slight a foundation of achievement 
it is based. For the author is a very minor poet, 
distinguished chiefly by an erotic mania and a pre- 
dilection for toying with unclean themes, and his 
poetical output thus far includes, besides the present 
volume, " Nineveh and Other Poems " and a slender 
sheaf of "Gedichte." He is the avowed enemy of 
the "Puritans" among our poets, among whom he 
includes most of our shining names, from Emerson, 
Longfellow, and Lowell to Gilder, Stedman, and 
Moody. This attitude he puts into a neat epigram : 
"Phryne is preferable to a New England spinster, 
but Aspasia is more desirable than Phryne." Mr. 
Viereck's quality as a singer may be illustrated by 
the closing stanzas of the poem which gives this col- 
lection a title. 

" Perhaps the passions of mankind 

Are but the torches mystical 
Lit by some spirit-hand to find 
The dwelling of the Master-Mind 

That knows the secret of it all, 
In the great darkness and the wind. 

" We are the Candle, Love the Flame, 

Each little life-light flickers out, 
Love bides, immortally the same : 
When of life's fever we shall tire 
He will desert us, and the fire 
Rekindle new in prince or lout. 

" Twin-born of knowledge and of lust, 
He was before us, he shall be 
Indifferent still of thee and me, 
When shattered is life's golden cup, 
When thy young limbs are shrivelled up, 
And when my heart is turned to dust. 

" Nay, sweet, smile not to know at last 
That thou and I, or knave, or fool, 
Are but the involitient tool 
Of some world-purpose vague and vast. 



No bar to passion's fury set, 

With monstrous poppies spice the wine : 
For only drunk are we divine, 

And only mad shall we forget." 

These verses represent Mr. Viereck at his best, and 
be has many more of stimulating quality and pas- 
sionate appeal. His thought is often far from clear 
and indeed some of his ideas have to be discreetly 
veiled but he is thoughtful enough to provide for 
us a marginal commentary which is quite as good 
reading as the poems themselves. As he says, " We 
may give a clue now and then which can direct the 
mind of the reader and perhaps prevent critics yet 
unborn from wasting marvellously ingenious devices 
upon the erection of spurious pyramids on the base of 
a fatal misprint or a mistaken assumption. Neither 
Goethe, nor Shakespeare, it may be urged, was his 
own commentator. The resultant loss, however, was 
both theirs and the world's." Mr. Viereck sees to it 
that the world shall suffer no such loss in the case 
of his own immortal works. A single quotation 
from the " Marginalia " will exemplify their galvanic 
character: "I once made the reckless remark that 
the three men I most admired were Christ, Napoleon, 
and Oscar Wilde, each a martyr to his creed, the 
ethical, the dynamic, and the aesthetic. After calm 
reflection I cannot find three men who typify more 
perfectly the great intellectual and temperamental 
world-currents. Recently in Paris I visited the 
graves of Napoleon and Oscar Wilde. As Jerusalem 
was too far away, I paid my devotion to the founder 
of Christianity, not at Notre Dame, but at the 
tomb of another intellectual of the race of Christ 
Heinrich Heine." 

Mr. Robert Haven Schauffler is the author of a 
striking poem called "Scum o' the Earth," suggested 
by the hordes of immigrants landing at Castle 
Garden. As they pass in procession before him, the 
various nationalities suggest to the poet's vision their 
racial potentialities for the enrichment of our nat- 
ional life. An Italian boy, for example, suggests 
these lines: 

" Genoese boy of the level brow, 
Lad of the lustrous, dreamy eyes 
Astare at Manhattan's pinnacles now 
In the first, sweet shock of a hushed surprise : 
Within yoiir far-rapt seer's eyes 
I catch the glow of the wild surmise 
That played on the Santa Maria's prow 
In that still gray dawn, 
Four centuries gone, 

When a world from the wave began to rise. 
Oh, it 's hard to foretell what high emprise 
Is the goal that gleams 
When Italy's dreams 
Spread wing and sweep into the skies. 
Caesar dreamed him a world ruled well ; 
Dante dreamed Heaven out of Hell ; 
Angelo brought us there to dwell ; 
And you, are you of a different birth ? 
You 're only a ' dago,' and ' scum o' the earth ' ! " 

So he takes them, Greeks and Poles and Czechs and 
Jews, and urges that the dreams they bring with 
them constitute their real value to us, far more than

offsetting their ragged habiliments and pitiful store 
of worldly goods. The broad humanity of this view 
is very appealing, no doubt, yet the poet who wrote 
"Unguarded Gates" represented a point of view 
that needs to be considered also. As becomes a 
musician, Mr. Schauffler finds in his own special 
art the inspiration for some of his finest verses. 

" Is music ' love in search of words ' ? Not so. 
For love well knows he never may express 
In words a tithe of all his tenderness, 
Nor paint in human speech a passion's glow 
Lit by his flame. Too deep and still, too low 
Even for angels' ears, the saeredness 
Of meaning when two hearts together press 
And feel from eye to eye love's secret flow. 

" But music is a house not made with hands, 
Built by love's Father, where a little space 

The soul may dwell ; a royal palace fit 
To meet the majesty of its demands. 

The place where man's two lives unite ; the place 
To hold communion with the infinite." 

Most of Mr. John Kendrick Bangs's verses prove 
their right to be called "Echoes of Cheer," and none 
more so than this pair of stanzas on "The Optimist." 

" Care came first and laid his siege, 

Laid his siege at my front-door ; 
Then the Wolf, the Lord and Liege 

Of all Trouble, brought his score. 
Well, I ' sicked ' the Wolf on Care 

Wolf was hungry past all doubt ; 
Chewed old Care up hide and hair, 

Left no sign of him about. 

" Then I took my faithful gun, 

Cheerfulness, from off the rack ; 
Loaded it with Wholesome Fun, 

Let Wolf have it front and back. . . . 
Made a fur coat of his hide 

He was quite a shaggy beast 
And the rest of him we fried 

For our glad Thanksgiving Feast." 

We best know Mr. Bangs as a professional jester ; 
but this book of his verses reveals the serious vein 
that lies beneath his merriment, expressing the 
simple faith and trust of a man at peace with him- 
self and the scheme of things entire.

The spell of 
the White 
Mountains. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

Although no book has yet caught the 
White Mountains wholly in its toils 
(and it is to be hoped none ever will), 
there comes occasionally a book with power to raise 
the image of them before the mind's eye, and to 
satisfy somewhat the mountain-lover's perpetual 
longing. Such a book is Mr. Winthrop Packard's 
" White Mountain Trails" (Small, Maynard & Co.), 
with its rather desultory but always delightful text, 
and its many wonderful illustrations. The writer 
takes his leisurely way over the best-known trails, 
apparently with no time-card but the sun, no map 
but the peaks and gullies of the mountains them- 
selves, and no set purpose but enjoyment. When 
a white admiral butterfly "politely shows the wrong 



road as a start for the trail up Bartlett," and then 
" leaves him in a wild tangle of slash to get up the 
mountain the way the bear does, on all fours," he 
does not even feel himself under obligation to learn 
wisdom from experience. Instead, he trusts a 
mountain brook to show him the way down, only 
to find that though "mountain brooks do not run 
away from you as mountain paths do, it is as well 
not to trust them too much, after dark." But Mr. 
Packard's wandering is not aimless, for in the 
course of it he accomplishes Carter Notch and 
Crawford Notch, sees the world from the peaks of 
Chocorua, Iron Mountain, Kearsarge, Carragain, 
Madison, Mount Jackson, and several others, and 
has four clear days on the top of Mount Wash- 
ington, "such as the fates in kindly mood sometimes 
deal out to fortunate mortals." He knows each of 
the mountains by itself, for "they have personality 
and grow to be individual friends, as well loved 
and ardently longed for when absent as any human 
neighbor or associate." Indeed, the aim of his ap- 
parent aimlessness is to catch each " individual " off 
guard, to surprise it from every angle, to come 
upon it if possible unexpectedly to himself and so 
to get at the very secret of its character. Be- 
cause he often succeeds, his book is worthy of its 
subject. Besides, it is to be doubted if any other 
writer about the White Mountains has seen so 
much by the way. The reader must be a very wise 
person indeed who does not envy Mr. Packard 
his ability to enjoy with full knowledge all the 
flowers and ferns, birds and trees, butterflies and 
mosses, and even the frogs and hedgehogs, he finds 
in each day's climbing. As a final excellence, the 
volume has some forty reproductions of skilfully- 
taken photographs, showing not only the looming 
grandeur of the mountains both in clear air and 
shrouded in mist or cloud, but much of the cher- 
ished detail of nearer views. 



Some well-told Not since th . e English-reading world 
tales of simple was filled with delight by the scenes 
Cornish folk. of humble Scottish life depicted by 
the Rev. John Watson has it been treated to any- 
thing of so marked excellence and striking original- 
ity in the same domain of realistic reproduction of 
the humors of the lowly as in Mr. Charles Lee's 
Cornish tales now introduced to the American public 
by Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co., in three volumes with 
the title, "Our Little Town," "Paul Carah, Cornish- 
man," and "The Widow Woman." The first vol- 
ume takes the form of separate sketches and stories, 
the other two of continuous narrative; but so little 
does Mr. Lee's art depend upon plot, upon the mere 
machinery or frame-work of story-building, that he 
is equally enjoyable in either manner. Cornishnaan 
to the very heart of him he must be, to write so 
sympathetically of the Cornish fisherfolk, and with 
so keen a relish for all their oddities of tempera- 
ment and peculiarities of speech. Dialect he cannot 
avoid using in letting his characters play their 
several parts, but it is nowhere overdone, nowhere

beyond the ready comprehension of the reader. 
Let us quote from a dialogue between "Bessie's 
Tom" and "stuttering Orlando" in '"Our Little 
Town." Orlando, in an unguarded hour, has been 
beguiled into matrimony, and his wife proves to be 
such a talker that he himself hardly gets a chance 
to open his mouth. " Haven't spit out a c-clean word 
for weeks," he moans. "Don't get t-time." Tom 
tries to comfort him, and asks: "Have 'e tried 
swearing ? If I mind right, your dees were always 
better gressed, like, than your Christian speech." 
"T-true," replies the other, mournfully. "So they 
were. But now they'm like the rest snails crawl- 
ing through t-tar." Here is a bit of shrewd wisdom 
from "Uncle Hannibal" in " The Widow Woman." 
He stands, pipe in hand, in his doorway, filling the 
space with his generous bulk and watching the dis- 
comfiture of John Trelill at the hands of a coquet- 
tish young woman. " When a chap an' a maid do 
come together," comments Uncle Hannibal, "chap 
shuts his eyes tight : maid aupens hers a bit wider. 
How should chap look to have a chanst? Man's 
human, but woman's woman 'at's what I d' say in 
my smart way." But John wins the maid in the 
end, and the story of the courtship, with its very 
unusual complications, is admirably told. Another 
original and amusing love story, contained in " Our 
Little Town," has to do with two maiden ladies in 
their fifties and a sixty-year-old suitor to the twain. 
Impartial in his affections, he begs them to decide 
between themselves which of the two shall be the 
one to accept him. The outcome is a little unex 
pected. " Paul Carah " is the story of a good-natured 
and amusing braggart who has lived some years in 
"the States" and returns to astonish the natives. 
As in the other books, both scenes and characters 
are drawn by the hand of a master. There are 
hours of solid enjoyment in these three volumes. 
Excellent line-drawings and a colored frontispiece 
are provided by Mr. Charles E. Brock for "The 
Widow Woman." Mr. Gordon' Browne illustrates 
"Paul Carah." 

Four years have passed since Harriet 
Letters and J r 

Memories of Hosmer s death, at the age or seventy- 
Harriet Hosmer. 8ev en ; and the interval has sufficed 
for collecting her more important correspondence 
and preparing therefrom and from other sources a 
good account of her life and work. " Harriet Hos- 
mer : Letters and Memories" (Moffat, Yard & Co.), 
edited by her friend Mrs. Lucien Carr (Cornelia 
Carr), forms a substantial volume of nearly four 
hundred pages, well-printed, well-illustrated, and 
teeming with matter of interest to all who take pleas- 
ure and pride in the achievements of this brilliant 
American woman and famous sculptor. It is true 
that she seemed to make herself, by expatriation for 
her art's sake, almost more of a European than an 
American. How she impressed the world abroad 
is partly shown in Frances Power Cobbe's descrip- 
tion of her : " She was in those days the most be- 
witching sprite that the world ever saw. Never 



have I laughed so helplessly as at the infinite fun 
of that bright Yankee girl. Even in later years, 
when we perforce grew a little graver, she needed 
only to begin one of her descriptive stories to make 
us all young again. I have not seen her since her 
return to America, nor yet anyone in the least like 
her. It is vain to hope to convey to any reader the 
contagion of her merriment. Oh! what a gift be- 
yond rubies are such spirits ! " Mrs. Carr gives us 
some admirable specimens of Miss Hosmer's fun, 
and among them a few stanzas of delicious French 
doggerel composed at Mrs. Sedgwick's school at 
Lenox, where Fanny Kemble made friends with her 
and used to say to her of an evening, "Come, Hatty, 
do give us some fun to-night." Most numerous and 
most characteristic are the letters to her old friend 
and patron, Mr. Wayman Crow, of St. Louis, father 
of her favorite classmate, and greatly helpful to her 
in procuring her admission to the course in anatomy 
at the medical school of the State University of 
Missouri. Miss Hosmer's Italian years fell in the 
time of the Brownings, and of course they and a 
host of other notables figure in her letters. The editor 
has done well to let her sculptor friend tell her own 
story, in large part ; and it is one well worth reading. 



Born in 1853, the Right Hon. George 
W. E. Russell lays early claim to the 
privilege of age in writing his remi- 
niscences. "One Look Back" (Doubleday) traces 
in highly agreeable fashion the first half-century or 
so of the life of one who, near the close of his book, 
declares himself ignorant of the sensation of dul- 
ness. Already, in his two series of " Collections 
and Recollections" published in 1898, and in his 
"Pocketful of Sixpences" and "Sketches and 
Snapshots," Mr. Russell has shown his talent as a 
raconteur; and the present volume will certainly 
do nothing to lessen his reputation. Proudly trac- 
ing his descent from that of William Lord Russell 
who laid down his life in the cause of constitu- 
tional liberty in 1683, the author gives us pleasing 
glimpses of his boyhood home, his school and uni- 
versity days, his life in London society, his jour- 
nalistic and public activities, and his labors of love 
as a zealous Churchman. Eulogizing the past with 
a pessimistic contemplation of the present that 
strangely contrasts with the general cheery tone of 
his book, he occasionally indulges in such strains 
as the following concerning his degenerate fellow- 
countrymen: "They do not care for the country in 
itself; they have no eye for its beauty, no sense of 
its atmosphere, no memory for its traditions. It is 
only made endurable to them by sport and gambling 
and boisterous house-parties; and, when from one 
cause or another these resources fail, they are 
frankly bored and long for London. They are no 
longer content, as our fathers were, to entertain 
their friends with hospitable simplicity. So pro- 
foundly has all society been vulgarized by the wor- 
ship of the Golden Calf that, unless people can vie

with alien millionaires in the sumptuousness with 
which they 'do you' delightful phrase, they 
prefer not to entertain at all. An emulous osten- 
tation has killed hospitality. All this is treason to 
a high ideal." Among the author's many friend- 
ships he notes with especial gratitude his obligations 
to the brilliantly gifted James Payn, whose love of 
anecdote called forth, first orally and then in literary 
form in the columns of the Manchester "Guardian," 
the "Collections and Recollections "mentioned above. 
There is also related the course of events leading up 
to Mr. Russell's connection with this " best news- 
paper in Great Britain," as he calls it. To that for- 
tunate connection we owe, humanly speaking, these 
subsequent anecdotal and autobiographic chapters. 
A few appropriate illustrations accompany the read- 
ing matter. . . 

The Cabinet Professor Henry Barrett Learned's 
as a branch of book on "The President's Cabinet" 
Government. and Dr Mary L Hinsdale's "His- 
tory of the President's Cabinet" treat of the same 
subject, but in different ways. Professor Learned's 
book begins with a chapter on the Cabinet in En- 
gland, and proceeds to elaborate at some length 
the evolution of the Cabinet in the United States, 
from the days of the Continental Congress through 
the period of the Confederation to the establishment 
of presidential government under the Constitution. 
After a careful account of the creation, in Washing- 
ton's time, of the first and more important secretary- 
ships, and after an essay on the term "Cabinet" as 
used in the United States, Professor Learned passes 
to a discussion of the offices of Attorney General, 
Secretary of the Navy, Postmaster General, Secre- 
tary of the Interior, Secretary of Agriculture, and 
Secretary of Commerce and Labor. A concluding 
chapter gives an historical summary and a brief 
analysis of the relations between the different cab- 
inet officers and the President. This volume, we 
are told, is intended to cover only the formation and 
structure of the Cabinet; but Professor Learned 
promises a second part of the work which is to treat 
of the "Practices and Personnel" of that body. It 
is this element, the personal, which characterizes 
the book of Dr. Hinsdale. This is deliberately ar- 
ranged upon an annalistic plan. The origin of the 
Cabinet is here very briefly treated, and the author 
proceeds to an account of the Cabinet of each ad- 
ministration, from Washington's first term in 1789 
to the presidency of Mr. Taft in 1909. Each of these 
chapter is accompanied by a valuable table showing 
the original make-up of the Cabinet, and the changes 
which took place in its membership. Around this 
personal framework, Dr. Hinsdale builds her account 
of the activities of the Cabinet, treating from this 
view-point many of the events and problems which 
are discussed topically in Professor Learned's book. 
At the close of the volume Dr. Hinsdale adds three 
analytical chapters, on the general principles of 
cabinet making, the relation of the Cabinet to Con- 
gress, and the relation of the Cabinet to the Presi- 



dent. The two works admirably supplement each 
other. Each is scholarly in execution, each is ade- 
quately equipped with bibliographical material and 
an index. Both appeal especially to the student of 
American history and government ; but, particularly 
in this "presidential year," both should also win the 
attention of the "general reader." 

Advances A. significant indication of the ever- 

tn medical > j < .1 

research in widening consequences of the Amer- 

the tropics. ican occupation of the Philippines 

and other tropical possessions of Spain, and of the 
sanitary developments in the Canal Zone, is to be 
seen in the recent work of Captain Charles F. Craig, 
of the Medical Corps of the United States Army, 
entitled "The Parasitic Amrebae of Man" (Lip- 
pincott). Time was when an army billet was a sine- 
cure not sought for purposes of medical research, 
though not a few illustrious names of army and navy 
physicians are to be found in the annals of natural 
history. To-day, in England, France, and Germany, 
and also in our own land, the advances in tropical 
medicine are largely made by physicians who find 
both opportunity and stimulus for research in the 
contact with disease, epidemics, plagues and para- 
sites of tropical peoples. Dr. Craig's contributions 
in this field have long been known to specialists, 
and are now made readily accessible to all in his 
illustrated monograph on the parasitic amosbse which 
worked such dread havoc on our soldiers in the 
Philippines and threaten all who travel in tropical 
lands. The ease of transportation to and from the 
south and the Orient brings their plagues to our 
doors, and too often within them ; so that the infec- 
tions here treated have become of widest general 
interest both to our own practitioners and to all 
who are concerned with the protection of public and 
private water-supplies against pollution. The book 
is replete with the latest discoveries of investigators 
in this field, in all lands; and discusses fully the 
distinctions between the abundant but innocuous 
amoebae of streams and reservoirs and the so-called 
"benign" parasites and the pathogenic ones. Abun- 
dant illustrations and a full bibliography of the 
widely scattered literature of the subject add to the 
value of this representative work of American 
scholarship and the only monographic work in En- 
glish upon the subject. 

In a stately quarto of 278 pages en- 
agefnnessaiv. titled " Prehistoric Thessaly " Messrs. 

A. J. B. Wace and M. S. Thompson 
have published through the Cambridge University 
Press (New York: Putnam) an account of recent ex- 
cavations and explorations in Northeastern Greece, 
from Lake Kopais to the borders of Macedonia. The 
volume is an expansion of previous reports by the 
same authors; and presents in a convenient form all 
the ai\ Ideological evidence as yet available for the 
prehistoric age in Thessaly. It is thus a contribution 
to the constantly-growing structure of our knowledge 
of ^Egean civilization. By obvious cleavage the book 



108 



THE DIAL 



[August 16, 



falls into two divisions : the first ten chapters describ- 
ing exhaustively the excavations by the authors, 
together with summaries of other men's work. The 
concluding seven chapters contain the theories and 
conclusions based on their finds, to be modified or 
verified by future discoveries. As was to be ex- 
pected, the pottery, found in great abundance, was 
their chief and safest guide: "the history of any site 
which has a deep undisturbed deposit can be read 
in its pottery." Comparative archaeologists will fol- 
low these elaborate lists of sherds, vases, jugs, and 
other ware with keen interest, and will note the paral- 
lelism between the Thessalian decorated work and 
that from Crete, the JEgean islands, and Mycenaean 
sites generally. The chapter on the "prehistoric 
history" of Northeastern Greece is an interesting 
example of the archaeological method. Using only 
the evidence dug out of the earth, and rigorously ex- 
cluding all racial and legendary names, the authors 
have reconstructed a Thessalian culture which they 
divide into four periods. None of these is marked by 
any splendor ; the decorated ware adheres to simple 
geometric patterns, while the statuettes and figurini 
are highly grotesque. " Only at the end of the pre- 
historic age did Mycenaean culture really reach 
Northern Greece; but before it could supplant the 
older cultures and gain a firm hold on Thessaly, it 
was itself swept away by the northern invasions that 
mark the dawn of historic Greece." The book is 
profusely illustrated from photographs and drawings 
in the body of the text, and by half-a-dozen fine col- 
ored plates. The matter of transliteration has been 
carefully attended to, and every needful help pro- 
vided in index, appendix, and references to the works 
of other authors. 

Married mm. In the ^ same genial vein as "The 
philosophers. Reflections of a Married Man " and 

and grandfathers, u The Opinions of a Philosopher," 

Mr. Robert Grant's "Convictions of a Grandfather" 
is written with the added advantage of some years 
more of accumulated wisdom and mellowness and 
kindly tolerance of the world's faults and foibles. 
It is inevitable that such books as these three 
should call to mind and invite comparison with Dr. 
Holmes's " Breakfast Table " series ; for there is not 
a little of the same whimsical humor in the obser- 
vations and meditations of each of these Bostonians 
professional men, both of them, and writers by 
avocation. The opening of Judge Grant's second 
chapter ('"But what do you regard as inordinate 
possessions?' asked Josephine, with whom I was 
discussing the subject") has in it the same abrupt 
challenge to one's interest that is familiar to the 
Autocrat's readers. "Convictions" is rather too 
strong a word to apply to the views of this grand- 
father ; he is by no means dogmatic or opinionated, 
and one of the charms of his book is that it leaves 
so many questions open for further debate. The 
questions themselves are not abstruse, but deal 
chiefly with such topics as automobiles and the 
increasing cost of living, old-age pensions, the mod- 



as national 
pastimes. 



ern woman, present-day culture and conversation, 
European travel, the contesting of wills, and certain 
other matters of not too severely legal a nature. 
The grace and fluency and charm of the author's 
style hardly need our commendation, at this late day. 

To those who have begun to make a 
serious study of pastimes, and are 
trying to put play into its proper rela- 
tion to the affairs of life, Mrs. Mary Master Need- 
ham's "Folk Festivals" (Huebsch) will come as an 
inspiration, a guide, and a help. The book is based 
upon the author's personal experiences in utilizing the 
almost universal love of the people for self-expression 
and correlating it with the work of the school in the 
teaching of history ; and it not only tells what folk- 
festivals are, and by way of illustration describes 
the more important Old World festivals and some 
successful experiments in America, but it shows how 
folk festivals may be given in this country, and how 
we may thereby revive an interest in festal days 
which are ours by inheritance, infuse some life and 
enthusiasm into our so-called national holidays, and 
learn how to celebrate them in a sane and appropri- 
ate manner so that their meaning may not be lost. 
Emphasis throughout the book is laid on the folk 
character the self-expression of the people in their 
celebrations of festival days. The book is written in 
an entertaining manner, but is thorough and com- 
plete; and for those who desire to pursue the sub- 
ject further, an exceedingly helpful bibliography is 
appended. 



NOTES. 



Admiral Mahan's book on " Sea Power " is said, on 
the authority of a British naval officer, to he the most 
generally read book in the libraries of war vessels in 
the British navy. 

"The Sign at Six," Mr. Stewart Edward White's 
new story, is published this month by the Bobbs- 
Merrill Co. It is a story of New York life, and is 
illustrated by M. Leone Bracker. 

A collected edition said to be the first made in En- 
glish of the political writings of Rousseau is soon to 
appear from the Cambridge University Press, repre- 
sented in this country by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons. 

Mrs. Martha Morley Stewart's story entitled " Grey- 
hound Fanny " (R. R. Donnelly & Sons Co.) is a strong 
appeal for a more humane and sympathetic treatment 
of animals. The book is a worthy contribution to the 
cause of humane education, especially of the young. 

Incidental to the Browning centenary is a new " thin 
paper " edition of his works in twelve volumes, pocket 
size, issued by the T. Y. Crowell Co. The volumes are 
printed from new plates, with large type, and are pro- 
vided with new portraits in photogravure and other 
decorations. 

An essay sometimes called a " prose-poem " by 
the French sculptor Rodin, addressed to the Venus of 
Milo and embodying an expression of the sculptor's 
artistic principles, has been translated into English by 
Miss Dorothy Dudley, and will be published at an early 
date by B. W. Huebsch.

Campaign lives of the would-be Presidents are prom- 
ised abundantly. First in the field is that of Governor 
Wilson, which Messrs. Putnam's Sons have already 
issued. It is, in effect, a new edition of Miss Hosford's 
life of Wilson, which has been highly commended in 
its earlier form, and now appears revised and enlarged. 

An early contribution to the literature of the Presi- 
dential campaign is " The Democratic Mistake," by Mr. 
A. G. Sedgwick, which Messrs. Scribner publish this 
month. Another timely book from the same house is 
" Majority Rule and the Judiciary," by Mr. W. L. Ran- 
som, a New York lawyer, with an introduction by Mr. 
Roosevelt. 

The reproduction of English and continental litera- 
ture in Japan is steadily increasing. Among works 
recently translated into Japanese are Shaw's " Man 
and Superman," Hauptmann's " Weavers," Flaubert's 
"Salambo," Daudet's "Sapho," Tolstoy's "Kreutzer 
Sonata," Maeterlinck's "Life of the Bee," and Cervantes' 
" Don Quixote." 

Some remarkably successful cloud pictures, by the 
well-known artist-photographer A. L. Coburn, will be re- 
produced in platinum prints as illustrations for Shelley's 
poem of " The Cloud," in a quarto prepared under the 
direction of the artist and published by Mr. C. C. Parker 
of Los Angeles, Cal. The edition is limited to sixty 
copies, at twenty-five dollars each. 

A new novel by a new writer Mrs. Dell H. Munger, 
of Palo Alto, Cal. is to be published this month by 
Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. Its scenes are laid in 
Kansas, and it has the striking title " The Wind Before 
the Dawn." The same firm have nearly ready a new 
story by Mrs. Mary Austin, " A Woman of Genius," 
dealing chiefly with the stage and stage people. 

The hundredth anniversary of the " Fort Dearborn 
Massacre," August 15, fitly commemorated by the 
Chicago Historical Society with appropriate ceremonies, 
is the occasion also of a new popular account of that 
historic tragedy " The Story of Old Fort Dearborn," 
written by Mr. Seymour Currey and published by Messrs. 
A. C. McClurg & Co. The volume is illustrated. 

Nashville, Tennessee, is the home of a number of 
authors of recent successful fiction. Mrs. Cora Harris, 
who wrote "The Circuit Rider's Wife" and "The 
Recording Angel," Mr. F. P. Elliott, who wrote " The 
Haunted Pajamas," and Mr. John Trotwood Moore, au- 
thor of " The Summer Hymnal," etc., are among those 
who are making of that old Southern city a new centre 
of literary activity. 

A new book by Mr. Harold Bell Wright, the famous 
producer of " best selling " novels, is announced for the 
coming fall. Its title is " Their Yesterdays," and the 
preliminary announcements claim for it a wide range 
of literary qualities, from those of " The Lady of the 
Decoration" to "The Reveries of a Bachelor" and 
" Letters from a Self-made Merchant to his Son." It 
will be supplied with illustrations in color, by Mr. F. 
Graham Coote. 

The average annual expenditure, on the part of our 
public libraries, for books, periodicals, and binding, has 
been made the subject of some careful study by the 
librarian of the James V. Brown Library of Williams- 
port, Pa. From his researches it appears that for every 
hundred thousand volumes circulated in the one hun- 
dred and seven libraries of the United States that issue 
that number in the course of a year, there is annually 
spent $3,199.00 for the above-named purposes. Put in 



another form, this means that one dollar a year, wisely 
spent, will provide good reading matter for more than 
thirty persons. 

How to spend one's vacation, and where to go to 
school or college after it is spent, are among the practi- 
cal concerns about which the Grand Rapids Public Li- 
brary offers to advise all comers. In its July "Bulletin " 
it calls attention to its guide-book collection whereby 
"you can readily plan your vacation so as to get the most 
out of it for the least money," and to its stock of school 
and college catalogues from which " one may learn some- 
thing of the character of the several institutions as well 
as the expenses." 

A new story entitled " My Lady's Garter," soon to 
be published by Messrs. Rand McNally & Co., derives 
a pathetic interest from the fact that its author, Mr. 
Jacques Futrelle, lost his life in the Titanic disaster. 
The same firm will bring out Mr. Eden Philpott's 
" The Lovers," a tale of English prison life during the 
Revolutionary War; "Stories of the Pilgrims," a book 
for children, by Miss Margaret B. Humphreys, with 
drawings by Lucy Fitch Perkins; " Rowena's Happy 
Summer," by Celia M. Robertson; "The Little King 
and Princess True," nature stories for young folks, by 
Mrs. A. S. Hardy; and a de luxe edition of "Gulliver's 
Travels," with twelve full-page colored illustrations by 
Mr. Milo Winter.

The States and the Federal Government ; Party Gov- 
ernment in the United States. 

The book, according to the author in his preface, is not in- 
tended as a systematic discussion of the character and 
operation of the government of the United States, but is a 
presentation of some of its salient features in the light of a 
fresh analysis of the character and operation of constitutional 
government. The hope is further expressed that, for this 
reason, the book will be found to be serviceable in the clari- 
fication of the public view as to policy and practice.

HORACE HOWARD FURNESS. 



The tie that binds into one people the various 
sections of the English-speaking world, creating 
a fundamental spiritual unity out of many 
diverse manifestations of thought and conduct, 
is their common speech, and the common litera- 
ture in which their racial ideals have found ex- 
pression. This it is which has set them in the 
vanguard of modern civilization, and made them 
the fount of vivifying and compelling ideas upon 
the highest of human concerns, the leaders of the 
world's thought in matters of religion, ethics, 
and political contrivance. It is one aspect of 
this general truth which Wordsworth so finely 
expressed in the lines : 

" We must be free or die, who speak the tongue 
That Shakespeare spake; the faith and morals hold 
Which Milton held," 

and other aspects of the same truth will readily 
suggest themselves to the reflective mind. In 
the plays of Shakespeare and the Authorized 
Version of the Bible we who are of English 
origin can boast possessions of richer value than 
are to be found in the literature of any other 
modern people, and should any branch of the 
English race forget to prize them at their true 
worth, or cease to hold them as inestimable trea- 
sures, such a lapse would be an ominous mark 
of spiritual decline, and of the breaking up of 
a solidarity as significant for the modern world 
as that of the .Roman genius was for the world 
of antiquity. 

There are signs that in this country we are 
losing our hold upon the English Bible, but 
Shakespeare seems still to keep a secure place 
in our thought. Speaking of educational pro- 
grammes, Sir Sidney Lee the other day urged 
the paramount importance of teaching Shake- 
speare in every school and college, no matter 
what else might or might not be taught. We 
are still reasonably faithful in following this pre- 
scription, although our schools show an alarming 
drift away from humanism into the bog of prac- 
ticality in their chase of the " vocational " will 
o' the wisp. Our national record of devotion to 
Shakespeare is fairly creditable, all things con- 
sidered. The puritan blight prevented his 
benign influence from making itself felt in our 
consciousness until something like a century ago, 
but when we found our way to him we took him

to our heart. The accomplished scholarship of 
Verplanck, Hudson, and Richard Grant White 
was applied to his exposition and elucidation, 
and such men as Emerson and Lowell paid him 
their tribute of belletristic appreciation. The 
greenest laurels of the American stage are those 
which have graced the brows of his interpreters. 
On the other side of the shield (but equally 
showing the extent to which he has occupied our 
minds), we may instance Whitman's rejection 
of him as the poet of " feudalism," and the per- 
verse ingenuity of the adherents of the Bacon- 
ian delusion (cradled in this country), of all 
mare's-nests surely the most extraordinary to be 
found in the annals of human aberration. At 
the present day, the world of Shakespeare is 
busily explored by many thousands of school 
children and college students, and edition after 
edition of the plays come from the American 
press. Finally, it is to the researches of the 
American Professor Wallace that we owe the 
most important of recent contributions to our 
knowledge of the poet's life. 

These reflections are occasioned by the neces- 
sity for recording the death of our most distin- 
guished Shakespearean scholar, Dr. Horace 
Howard Furness, who passed away on the thir- 
teenth of August, at the age of seventy-eight. 
A son of William Henry Furness, the famous 
Unitarian divine, Emerson's contemporary and 
friend, he was born in Philadelphia November 
2, 1833. Graduated from Harvard in 1854, he 
numbered among his classmates Charles Russell 
Lowell, General John W. Ames, Bishop W. S. 
Perry, Professor Truman H. Safford, and many 
other distinguished men. A period of European 
travel followed, and then he returned to take 
up the study of law in his native city. He was 
admitted to the bar in 1859, and the next year 
opened an office for the practice of law. He 
was eager to enter the army, but was prevented 
by the deafness which was to cut him off in 
such large measure from human intercourse for 
the rest of his life, and to make possible that 
concentration upon scholarly pursuits to which 
he was to owe his fame. He was by no means 
wholly removed from the affairs of men, and 
took a leading part in the relief work of the 
army and in the organization of the sanitary 
commission, besides carrying on his law busi- 
ness for some years. He was married in 1860, 
and became the father of three children, all of 
whom have become distinguished. In his later 
years, he was the recipient of many honors, 
American and foreign, including the presidency 
of the German Shakespeare Society, and mem- 



bership in the American Academy of Arts and 
Letters. For the last half century, his life has 
been typically that of the scholar, tempered by 
sufficient outside interests to give it a pleasing 
variety ; and working quietly in his library, he 
has accomplished the monumental work to 
which he owes his fame. 

" I 've acted merely as a pair of scissors " was 
his own modest description of that work, of 
which he further spoke as " serving excellently 
to keep an old fellow out of mischief." The 
world has taken it more seriously than that, and 
America points to it with pride as one of her 
greatest contributions to culture. His love of 
Shakespeare dated from his childhood. " I was 
a boy in my teens," he said, " when I first heard 
Mrs. Kemble read Shakespeare, and from that 
moment I belonged to Shakespeare." As early 
as 1850, he made a special study of "Hamlet," 
collecting and collating for his own use the views 
of the earlier commentators, thus f oreshadowmg 
the plan which he was later to apply to the pro- 
duction of the great " Variorum " Shakespeare. 
The work gradually took shape in his mind, but 
he spent a score of years in study and the collec- 
tion of materials before he was ready to publish 
his first volume. That volume was the " Romeo- 
and Juliet " of 1871, foUowed by " Macbeth " 
in 1873, " Hamlet " in 1877, " King Lear " in 
1880, " Othello " in 1886, The Merchant of 
Venice " in 1888, "As You Like It " in 1890, 
"The Tempest" in 1892, "A Midsummer 
Night's Dream" in 1895, " The Winter's Tale '* 
' in 1898, " Much Ado about Nothing " in 1899, 
"Twelfth Night" in 1901, "Love's Labour's. 
Lost," in 1904, and " Anthony and Cleopatra ' r 
in 1907. The " Variorum " Shakespeare, as it 
now stands, consists of these fourteen plays, to- 
gether with the " Richard III." of 1908, edited 
by Mr. H. H. Furness, Jr. The son, for some 
years past trained to collaborate with the father, 
may be trusted to carry on the work upon the 
same plan and in the same spirit. Let us trust 
that a descendant in the third generation will be 
ready to complete it fifty years from now. The 
volumes which we already have are marvels of 
exhaustive scholarship and models of conserva- 
tive critical judgment. The task of reading all 
that has been written about even a single play 
of Shakespeare, of weighing it all and selecting 
what is worth preserving, and then presenting 
this sifted residuum in orderly arrangement, 
would seem to be a fair work for a lifetime. But 
Dr. Furness did this fourteen times over, and 
with an intelligence, an authority, and a nicety 
of judgment that are likely to be the despair of 



1912.]

generations of scholars to come. It was a colos- 
sal achievement, and is not matched by many, 
either in this country or in any other. 

Dr. Felix Schelling, who knew him well, thus 
writes of him in "The Nation": 

" Horace Howard Furness was an old-fashioned 
scholar, and an old-fashioned man. He recalled at all 
times that leisure is an essential of sound scholarship, 
not leisure to dawdle, but leisure to do what is to be 
done wholly and completely no matter what the time 
involved, leisure to read, to know, to be infinitely more 
than the narrow specialist, digging one ditch in oblivion 
of the world about and the sky above. His was the 
old-fashioned courtesy that has time to remember trifles 
and to be kindly to unconsidered persons. ... I have 
never seen him angry save where some act of oppression 
or ungenerosity was in question and then his indignation 
knew no bounds. For the arrogance of petty scholar- 
ships he had an amused smile ; for even small, if genuine, 
accomplishment an ungrudging and instant recognition. 
His affections were always on the side of justice." 

This personal tribute fitly supplements the esti- 
mate of Dr. Furness's scholarship ; for those who 
were privileged to know him, or even to hear 
him upon the rare occasions when he was per- 
suaded to read in public from his beloved poet, 
got an impression of a personality which over- 
shadowed even his immense reputation for learn- 
ing the personality of a kindly, genial, and 
benignant spirit. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



THE GENIAL MANNER OF A GREAT SHAKESPEARE 

SCHOLAR may do more to promote the study of 
"Hamlet" and "Othello" and all the rest of the 
imperishable thirty-seven plays (if that is the exact 
number) than will be accomplished by any amount 
of learning and critical acumen displayed in editorial 
prefaces and notes. But Dr. Horace Howard Fur- 
ness, whose recent death in his seventy-ninth year is 
cause for deep regret, had both erudition and charm. 
Those who were privileged to know him in life can 
never forget the cheer and inspiration of his pres- 
ence; those who have heard his public readings of 
his favorite poet will bear witness that they have 
carried thence a wonderfully quickened appreciation 
of Shakespeare's genius; and those who have read 
his commentaries (or any random passages of them) 
on the fourteen plays that came from his editorial 
hand in the great Variorum Edition now left in 
charge of the son, cannot have failed to find a new 
and perhaps unexpected delight in those bugbears 
of the impatient, introductions and footnotes. Un- 
fortunately, the price of the Variorum volumes is 
such as to have rendered their popular purchase 
impossible, and not even all public libraries possess 
them; and where the library does own them they 
are not seldom withheld from free circulation. Con- 
sequently many readers who would have enjoyed 



them have not yet had a taste of their fine quality. 
This may be a fitting occasion for giving a specimen 
of Dr. Furness's art as Shakespeare-interpreter 
chosen from the last volume that bore his name as 
editor, the "Antony and Cleopatra." Commenting 
upon the excessive ingenuity of some Shakespeare 
scholars, he exclaims, "Much learning has made us 
mad! " and then continues: "Even with more rea- 
son than in Caesar's character, is it necessary that 
we should accept Cleopatra, at Shakespeare's hands, 
with minds unbiased by history. We should know 
no more of her than we hear on the stage. Of her 
past, of her salad days, we should know nothing but 
what we are told. The first words that she and An- 
thony utter tell of boundless, illimitable love, and 
this love is maintained to the last throb of life in 
each of them. . . . Even in the scene with Caesar's 
ambassador, Thidias, who comes to Cleopatra with 
overtures of peace and favour on condition that she 
will give up Anthony, we knowing ones, crammed 
with history as pigeons are with peas, tip each other 
the wink and lay our fingers on our shrewd noses at 
Cleopatra's evident treachery when she sends word 
that she kisses Caesar's conquering hand, and kneels, 
with her crown, at his feet. But those who read the 
Queen only by the light thrown by Shakespeare, see 
clearly enough that at this lowest ebb of Anthony's 
fortunes this was the only course she could prudently 
take ; to gain time for him she must temporise with 
Caesar." Has it ever before been Shakespeare's lot 
to fall into the hands of so richly appreciative an edi- 
tor, an editor so gifted with insight and humor and 
interpretative skill? 

ARTISTIC DETACHMENT, or sufficient severance 
of self from the product of one's pen (or brush, or 
chisel, as the case may be) to enable one to attain 
the impersonal standpoint and to view with equal 
calm both praise and censure of one's work, can 
only come with entire and unselfish devotion to art. 
In literary squabbles, of which the history of litera- 
ture is full, are to be found many striking examples 
of the inartistic attitude, the grievous lack of artistic 
detachment. When Poggio Fiorentino and Georgios 
Trapezuntios fell out (as we read of their doing in 
Symonds's "Renaissance in Italy") over Poggio's 
translations from Diodorus and Xenophon, the two 
mighty scholars allowed their personal feelings to 
get terribly tangled up with what was at first a purely 
literary question. The Florentine seems first to 
have lost his temper. "You lie in your throat! " he 
shrieked in an apoplexy of passion, whereupon the 
Greek boxed his ears; then Poggio caught Georgios 
by the hair, and the two learned professors fell to 
pommelling each other until they were separated by 
their respective pupils. In what delightful contrast 
to this stands, for example, Mr. A. C. Benson's 
urbane attitude toward certain outrageously harsh 
critics of his " Beside Still Waters " ! It is in a later 
book ("At Large") that he ventures to offer a few 
remarks in reply. His unfailing good humor, even 
when he indulges in a little gentle sarcasm, is admir-

able. The passage is no longer brand- new, but is still 
worth quoting, even at some length. "The book was 
carefully enough written," says Mr. Benson, " and I 
have been a good deal surprised to find that it has met 
with considerable disapproval, and even derision, on 
the part of many reviewers. It has been called mor- 
bid and indolent, and decadent, and half-a-hundred 
more ugly adjectives. Now I do not for an instant 
question the right of a single one of these conscien- 
tious persons to form whatever opinion they like 
about my book, and to express it in any terms they 
like. ... I do not dispute the possibility of their 
being perfectly right. An artist who exhibits his 
paintings, or a writer who publishes his books, chal- 
lenges the criticism of the public; and I am quite 
sure that the reviewers who frankly dislike my book, 
and said so plainly, thought they were doing their 
duty to the public, and warning them against teach- 
ing which they believed to be insidious and even 
immoral. I honour them for doing this, and I ap- 
plaud them, especially if they did violence to their 
own feelings of courtesy and urbanity in doing so." 
And after another half-page in similar vein, he con- 
cludes: "I have no intention of trying to refute or 
convince my critics, and I beg them with all my 
heart to say what they think about my books, be- 
cause only by the frank interchange of ideas can we 
arrive at the truth." On paper, this sort of thing 
may look easy enough; but when it is one's own 
skin that is pricked the situation assumes a different 
complexion and one is more inclined to play the part 
of a Poggio than of a dispassionate lover of truth. 

. 

MEREDITH AND HIS MUSE, or, better, Meredith's 
attitude toward his muse, will engage the interest of 
those readers of his letters (now appearing, in selec- 
tions, in " Scribner's Magazine ") who care for some- 
thing besides mere personalities in literature of this 
sort. His first love, poetry, was for obvious reasons 
often forced to give place to prose. In a letter of 
1861 to the Rev. Augustus Jessopp he says : " As 
to my love for the Muse, I really think that is ear- 
nest enough. I have all my life done battle in her 
behalf, and should, at one time, have felt no blessing 
to be equal to the liberty to serve her. Praise sings 
strangely in my ears. I have been virtually propelled 
into a practical turn, by the lack of encouragement 
for any other save practical work." And a few years 
later to the same confidant: "As to the Poems: I 
don't think the age prosaic for not buying them. A 
man who hopes to be popular, must think from the 
mass, and as the heart of the mass. If he follows 
out vagaries of his own brain, he cannot hope for 
general esteem ; and he does smaller work." Fur- 
ther on in the same letter : " Between realism and 
idealism there is no natural conflict. This completes 
that. Realism is the basis of good composition : it 
implies study, observation, artistic power, and (in 
those who can do more) humility. Little writers 
should be realistic. They would then at least do solid 
work. They afflict the world because they will at- 
tempt what it is given to none but noble workmen 



to achieve. A great genius must necessarily employ 
ideal means, for a vast conception cannot be placed 
bodily before the eye, and remains to be suggested. 
Idealism is an atmosphere whose effects of grandeur 
are wrought out through a series of illusions, that are 
illusions to the sense within us only when divorced 
from the groundwork of the real. Need there be 
exclusion, the one of the other ? The artist is incom- 
plete who does this. Men to whom I bow my head 
(Shakespeare, Goethe; and in their way, Moliere, 
Cervantes) are Realists au fond. But they have the 
broad arms of Idealism at command. They give us 
earth, but it is earth with an atmosphere. One may 
find as much amusement in a Kaleidoscope as in a 
merely idealistic writer ; and, just as sound prose is 
of more worth than pretentious poetry, I hold the 
man who gives a plain wall of fact higher 'in esteem 
than one who is constantly shuffling the clouds and 
dealing with airy, delicate sentimentalities, headless 
and tailless imaginings, despising our good, plain 
strength." ... 

THE TENTH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF THE 
.HISTORY OF ART will be held this autumn some 
time in October, one infers from published announce- 
ments in the halls of the Royal Accademia de' 
Lincei in the Palazzo Corsini, Rome. It is expected 
that the papers to be read will interest not only art- 
ists and students of art history, but also those who 
concern themselves with the spread of art instruc- 
tion in universities and schools generally. Papers 
and discussions will be grouped under four heads: 
1. The history of early Christian and mediaeval 
art to the end of the fourteenth century. 2. The 
fifteenth century. 3. The history of art from the 
sixteenth century to the present time. 4. Historico- 
artistic methodology; care of works of art; historical 
researches in technical methods; general organiza- 
tion of the work of the congresses. In languages 
allowed, it will be a penteglot conference, Italian, 
French, German, English, and Spanish being the 
permitted tongues. Of especial interest to librarians, 
and to others who give their attention to the litera- 
ture of art, will be four expositions to be held in 
connection with the Congress, of photographic 
reproductions in one or more colors for the illustra- 
tion of works on art history; of Italian periodicals, 
whether in course of publication or not, on the his- 
tory of art; of publications not on the market, such 
as catalogues of private collections and sale cata- 
logues; and, finally, of kinds of paper adapted for 
use in histories of art, such as insure, that is, dura- 
bility and neatness of photographic reproductions. 
Reductions in railway fares and free entrance to all 
government and municipal museums and galleries 
for the whole month of October are promised to 
members of the Congress, subscription to which is 
twenty-five francs, or, to ladies accompanying a mem- 
ber, ten francs. Communications from those desiring 
to read papers, and from other would-be attendants, 
are invited by the executive committee, whose secre- 
tary is Signor Roberto Papini, Via Fabio Massimo 
60, Rome.

THE AMAZINGLY PROLIFIC " IBID," to whom we 
see more works attributed (in the footnotes of every 
third book we take up) than are now ascribed to 
Bacon by even the most zealous Baconian, has caused 
one of our correspondents so much bewilderment and 
such fruitless searching of biographical dictionaries 
and histories of literature that she appeals through 
us for any information concerning him that any of 
our readers may be able to furnish. She says in her 
letter : " Some one told me one day, with a quizzical 
look which I could not understand, that Ibid was a 
half-brother to the Vide sisters Vide Supra and 
Vide Infra; but that didn't help me much, since 
these same Misses Vide have caused me hardly less 
perplexity than has Ibid himself. Another informant 
assured me that ' Ibid ' was not a real name, but the 
pseudonym of Op Cit, who was a Chinese (or was 
it Siamese?) sage of the fortieth century B.C., and 
great-grandfather of the almost equally famous Loc 
Cit. But why don't the reference books tell us some- 
thing about him? Can you tell me whether there 
is any uniform and not too expensive edition of his 
works, and if so by whom it is published ? " Pending 
more definite information, our correspondent will 
perhaps be glad to learn that she has companions in 
her perplexity. Not long ago a Columbia student 
approached Miss Mendenhall, of the New York 
Public Library, with just the same wrinkle in his 
forehead that ruffles our fair correspondent's brow. 
Miss Mendenhall relates the incident in " New York 
Libraries." She says : " The other day a student 
from Columbia came into the library for help on a 
list of references in history which he was to read 
before writing a thesis [for a doctor's degree ?]. He 
said, ' I have found most of the books in the Colum- 
bia library, but there is one author I can't find any- 
where, and I have spent a good deal of time looking. 
He has a strange name and I have never heard of 
him as a historian, but he has written a good many 
of the books on my list ; his name is " Ibid." ' 
Strange that there should be such a conspiracy of 
silence concerning this able and eminent author. 



AN ENVIABLE READER, a reader with vision so 
quick, with retina of the eye so receptive, as to be 
able to take in a whole page at a glance, and with 
a memory capable of holding and repeating all that 
is read, is made the subject of an article in the 
"Journal of the American Medical Association" by 
Dr. George M. Gould, whose writings on eye-strain, 
as well as on Lafcadio Hearn and other topics, have 
made him well known in the book-world. The reader 
he now describes is certainly of the sort to which 
most of us would like to belong in this age of more 
books, more really good books, than one can find 
time to do more than glance at. But that glance 
would suffice if one were like Dr. Gould's "Mr. C.," 
who is said to be able to read several books at a 
sitting and to repeat without error all that he has 
read. Fond of poetry and novels, what a banquet 
of books he must have as he sits before his cheerful 
fire or steam radiator of a winter's evening! 



As to Mr. C.'s peculiar eye-structure, it appears that 
some time in middle life he suffered a destruction 
of the central or " macular " portion of the retina of 
the right eye from inflammation due to eye-strain. 
The "fixing" part, that is, of the retina was obliter- 
ated, and a round blind space was left. The other 
eye remained unaffected, and the patient continued 
to enjoy something like normal vision, until "by 
long, unconscious and forced exercise, the healthy 
zone of the right retina surrounding the macular 
was educated to such a degree that it could, when 
unmoved, receive and transmit to the brain the im- 
age of the entire page, except that part falling upon 
the central portion, which had been destroyed," but 
which, of course, was helped out by the undiseased 
left eye. Here, then, is indicated a means whereby 
anyone might, perhaps, become a reader of more 
than Macaulayesque rapidity if he chooses to sub- 
mit to a little doctoring" of one eye and to educate 
that eye in the proper manner afterward. 


A "CLASSICAL FOUNDATION" AS A "PRACTICAL 
EQUIPMENT FOR LIFE'S JOURNEY" may to the "prac- 
tical " man sound too absurd even to laugh at. And 
yet so strenuously active and wide-awake and un- 
visionary a person as Mr. James O. Fagan, railroad 
man, telegraph operator, traveller in two hemi- 
spheres, and "self-made" (as the saying goes) from 
boyhood, deliberately acknowledges his supreme in- 
debtedness to classical study as the groundwork of 
his training for the work he was to find to do in the 
world. In the August instalment of his " Auto- 
biography of an Individualist" in "The Atlantic 
Monthly," dwelling on that part of his storm-and- 
stress period that was passed at East Deerfield, 
Massachusetts, he says : " In presenting an argument, 
stating a case, or pleading a cause, other things being 
equal, I always attributed my intellectual advantage 
to the fact that in my youth I had received a thorough 
drilling in Latin and Greek, while my companions 
as a rule, in my line of life, had not. As a simple 
practical equipment for life's journey, what may be 
called my classical foundation seems to me now to 
be worth all the other features of my school educa- 
tion put together." Readers of Mr. Fagan 's variously 
interesting and color-abounding chapters may thank 
fortune that his boyhood antedated the vocational 
school and the era of industrial training. 



A PROBLEM IN TRANSLATION that in all likelihood 
will never be satisfactorily solved has been attacked 
afresh by an English aspirant to honors in the field 
of Bible literature. Sir Edward Clarke, an eminent 
barrister whose serious hours have been spent "in 
endeavouring to put logical thought into clear, forci- 
ble, and harmonious language," regards this training 
as one qualifying him to render with precision and 
grace the Epistles of St. Paul. Retaining, as he has 
tried to, the virtues of both the Authorized Version 
of 1611 and the Revised Version of 1881, and avoid- 
ing their vices, he has produced a hybrid that can 
hardly fail to displease both those who cling fondly 



124 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



to the familiar King James phraseology and those 
few who ask for a thoroughly modern style in their 
English Bible. Meanwhile the whole question at 
issue is well discussed by Mr. Ernest E. Kellett, a 
schoolmaster and a student of literature, in a " Lon- 
don Quarterly Review" article entitled "The Trans- 
lation of the New Testament," which scores a good 
point in calling attention to the substantial inaccuracy 
that often accompanies a slavishly literal rendering 
of a work in an alien tongue, and that does in many 
instances mar both the Authorized Version of our 
Bible and all versions that, like the Revised, are 
based upon it. Another point of Mr. Kellett's is 
that the archaic style of both these versions, while 
generally appropriate to the Old Testament, is not 
the manner suited to the New, which is written in a 
dialect of Greek that was the vernacular of the time 
and place of writing as, it is claimed, certain re- 
cently discovered Egyptian papyri have proved. 
Yet, after all is said, it will be long before the ear 
will receive willingly any conspicuously modern idi- 
oms in the Gospels, or, indeed, elsewhere in the Bible. 
A modernized version of Shakespeare would not 
elicit more vehement protest. 


" AN EPOCH OF SOLEMN AND INSANE TRIFLING " 

is what ours is declared to be by the diverting and 
fertile author of "Tremendous Trifles," "The Man 
Who was Thursday," "All Things Considered," and 
sundry other books. In this epoch, to which our 
brilliant paradoxologist must, chronologically at least, 
be said to belong, the late Andrew Lang, he goes on 
to remark (in his Lang obituary in "The Illustrated 
London News "), labored under three disadvantages : 
he was universal, he was amusing, and he was lucid. 
As to universality, a quality less valued and under- 
stood now than in Queen Elizabeth's time, he pro- 
ceeds to say, in true Chestertonian vein : "It would 
be useless, I suppose, to tell the modern critics that 
a man cannot really be interested in Homer without 
being a little interested in Chinese teapots. It would 
be called paradoxical to say that every man who 
really thinks about the Stuarts must sometimes think 
about Spiritualism. . . . Folklore and fishing are 
really very near each other, both in the deeper mys- 
teries of nature and the superficial developments of 
lying." What a quantity of hitherto unsuspected 
resemblances and differences we should have gone to 
our graves without knowing anything about, had not 
Mr. Chesterton been sent in the nick of time to point 
them out! After reading him, who is there but must 
feel, with Stevenson, that in a world so full of a 
number of things we all of us ought to be happy as 
kings? . . . 

A NEW LIBRARY BUILDING FOR HARVARD has at 

last been provided through the generosity of Mrs. 
George D. Widener of Philadelphia, mother of the 
late Henry E. Widener who with his father went 
down in the sinking of the Titanic last April, and 
whose bequest of his valuable library to the univer- 
sity from which he was graduated five years ago is 



already well known. One of the conditions of that 
bequest, it will be recalled, was that proper housing 
and care of the bequeathed library should not be 
lacking ; and this condition is now fulfilled by the 
testator's mother, who will make the long-needed 
building a worthy memorial to her son by expending 
two million dollars, if necessary, in its erection. 
Already the architects and the university authorities 
have consulted together over the location and general 
plan of the new building, and a site has been fixed 
upon extending from the present library southward. 
Mr. Horace Trumbauer, architect to the Widener 
family, is said to have been commissioned to draw 
the plans. And thus Harvard's most urgent need 
in fact, the most urgent need one could point to in 
the whole library world after years of weary wait- 
ing is to be adequately, even magnificently, met. 



THE DEATH OF JOHANN MARTIN SCHLEYER is 

announced by recent despatches from Constance; 
and so from this Babel of multitudinous tongues is 
removed the enthusiastic linguist who, a third of a 
century ago, conceived in one sleepless night the 
general outlines of what he hoped would prove a uni- 
versal medium of communication, binding all nations 
in a linguistic brotherhood. And, indeed, Volapiik 
did make rather astonishing headway at first, its 
grammar being translated into thirty-five languages, 
and its literary use extending into the magazine field 
until twenty-five periodicals could be pointed to as 
printed in this wonderful Weltsprache. ButSchleyer 
was not allowed to enjoy a monopoly in this tempting 
domain of world-language-making, and to-day the 
most vigorous rival of Volaptik, Esperanto, seems to 
have far outdistanced its senior competitor, and 
indeed all its competitors. Schleyer was a German 
of the Germans, an ardent philologist, the master of 
an incredible number of languages, and the trans- 
lator of his own grammar into most if not all of the 
thirty-five in which it was printed. That all his work 
should have turned out to be as the digging of holes 
in the sand on the seashore, is little short of pathetic. 



CERTAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN MOD- 
ERN ENGLISH JOURNALISM. 

(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 

London, August 14, 1912. 

Since I first began to write for a living (it is 
more years ago now than I care to set down in 
print), a good many changes have overtaken the 
London journalist. Time was, in the early nineties, 
when the editor of a big daily made something of a 
figure in the land. He was the Editor: that was 
enoug'*. When the brilliant amateur (myself for 
example) had an idea for a series of bright and 
epoch-making articles, it was into the Editor's more 
or less receptive ear that he poured his tale. True, 
that gentleman was not always very accessible: 
even now, with his glory so sadly shorn, he occa- 
sionally thinks it good for the aspirant's health to

keep him waiting half an hour or more in an outer 
room before admitting him into the majesty of the 
Presence ; but at all events, in those days, he was in 
command. He could do things on his own respon- 
sibility. 

I forget who it was who made the astounding 
discovery that the important man on a daily paper 
was not the editor but the business manager. Pos- 
sibly the business manager discovered it himself; 
no doubt he had long suspected it, and doubt be- 
came certainty when he beheld the remarkable 
influence wielded by the late Mr. Moberley Bell, 
then manager of "The Times." For many years 
that remarkable man controlled the destinies of 
what we used to consider the first newspaper in the 
world ; and seeing the success with which he con- 
ducted its affairs it was not surprising that several 
owners of other journals began to dream of the 
simple economy of discharging their editor and 
appointing in his place the gentleman who looked 
after the advertisements. The natural result was a 
certain decentralization, a delegation of power to 
subordinates. The Sports Editor, the Literary 
Editor, the Art Editor, the Society Editor, all 
assumed an importance that they had not possessed 
before. With their rise the glory of the Editor- 
in-Chief has somewhat faded. 

And then, too, there were the leader-writers, 
now a decaying race. Time was when the young 
man, fresh from the university, looked toward 
journalism as a possible profession, or at the worst 
as a support while he was making his way to fame 
and fortune with the novels and poems that he 
wrote to please himself and posterity. The position 
of leader-writer on a big morning paper was one of 
the prizes of the profession ; grave and reverend 
elders were pointed out to him as having attained 
to this Olympian height, drawing handsome salaries 
for the privilege of instructing some thousands of 
breakfast-tables three mornings in the week. The 
good journalist then was the man who could be 
trusted to write on any given subject with an air of 
omniscience, an occasional touch of scholarship, and 
a graceful turn of wit, all in three paragraphs of 
approximately equal length. 

The leading article was heavy, and heaviness is 
now the unforgivable sin. Compulsory education 
and the cheap press have produced between them a 
class of reader who is incapable of assimilating a 
paragraph containing more than a single sentence. 
The old style of leader still drags on a precarious 
existence in one or two papers like "The Times" 
or "The Morning Post"; the other papers have pro- 
duced a different and much shorter substitute, under 
a head-line that catches the eye of the most careless 
reader. For the morning journalist has had to find 
a form that would appeal not only to the leisurely 
citizen who can afford to give an hour to his paper 
after breakfast, but to the far more common case of 
the man of business who wants to learn as much as 
possible in the twenty minutes journey underground 
to his city office. And before this gentleman ap- 



pears upon the scene, there is the crowd of working- 
men who board the early trains, the throng of clerks 
and office-boys and shop-girls who have a halfpenny 
to spare for amusement and information. All of 
these want something that they can understand, and 
at a glance. The direct and simple appeal to them ; 
they are not yet capable of appreciating a closely 
reasoned argument. 

And one consequence of this is, that modern jour- 
nalism no longer affords a field for the accomplished 
writer. It is a commonplace that the man with uni- 
versity training is at a discount on the daily press of 
to-day. Literature is not wanted, but a well-known 
name at the head of a few disjointed notes is worth 
money. And this is how the Expert came into his 
own. Your well-equipped journal now must have 
its staff of Experts, qualified by actual experience to 
criticize the daily performances of golfers, cricketers, 
football-players, and other gentlemen who are in the 
public eye at the moment. Obviously it is far more 
interesting to the general public to know that the ac- 
count of the Test Match against Australia or South 
Africa is from the pen of some brilliant professional 
or amateur who has himself taken part in similar 
contests than to read some anonymous description, 
even by a master of the reporting art. But some of 
the players who have been dragged into the service 
of the cheap press for this purpose find considerable 
difficulty in stringing together the few simple sen- 
tences that are required. It is not unamusing to note 
the air of relief with which they employ, now and 
again, some outworn journalistic tag that has stuck 
in their memory. 

As to the golf expert, his name is legion. Mr. 
H. H. Hilton, winner of championships at home and 
abroad, must be one of the busiest journalists alive, 
if we are to judge by the number of articles bearing 
his name that appear day by day in various papers. 
Yet it may be said for some of these golfing writers, 
at least, that they do not disgrace their new profes- 
sion. Some of them can handle the pen as well as 
the putter, or nearly. Indeed, Mr. Horace Hutch- 
inson, the first of the tribe to adopt the journalistic 
habit, has written novels of some merit. He is a 
writer who happens also to be a prominent player 
of the game ; it is probable that in any case he would 
have produced books on something. But the editing 
of the Badminton book on golf was placed in his 
hands, and from that day his career was made. Golf 
had become an obsession ; golfers all over the coun- 
try demanded reams of gossip about their favorite 
pursuit; to many, the name of Horace Hutchinson 
stood for more in the world of letters than that of 
George Meredith or of Thomas Hardy. 

It must be confessed that the lot of the golf ex- 
pert is not an easy one. However well a man may 
know the game, however often he may visit new 
courses and play with local cracks, there must come 
a time when the task of turning out a column a week 
in two or three different papers begins to pall. He 
must long for a change of subject. Yet many of 
these gallant fellows carry on their business week 



126 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



by week without a break for years. It is a making 
of bricks without straw, or, let us say, of soup 
without stock. For their business is not the mere 
reporting of games, but the collecting of gossip; 
they have to start the golfing world talking on some 
new topic ; it is theirs to provide conversation for 
the club-houses of the kingdom. We need not be 
surprised that they occasionally take up curious 
theories. In a sort of despair, as the fateful day 
comes round, they will clutch eagerly at anything 
to fill out a paragraph. 

From the realms of sport, the Expert gradually 
made his way into other journalistic fields. About 
the beginning of this century, when the South 
African war was on, the craze for military experts 
on all the papers became ridiculous. Every little 
periodical must needs have its War Editor; never 
before in the history of the world had there been 
so great a demand for military writers. Naturally, 
most of the officers in the regular army being away 
on service or on duty at home, the demand consid- 
erably outran the supply, and the strangest specimens 
were employed as military experts, men who had 
been in the ranks, or had held a commission in the 
volunteers, or perhaps had joined the college cadet 
corps when they were at school. The few real sol- 
diers who were about could almost command their 
own price. Those were great days for the man who 
had once been through a course of drill. 

I suppose it is much the same in all professions 
and in all countries. The general practitioner must 
give way to the specialist, and the man who intends 
to succeed in modern journalism does well to select 
some subject as early as possible and make it his 
own. Let him travel to Asia Minor or to the islands 
of the Pacific, to Siberia or the Argentine (for it is 
useful to have that touch of authority that comes 
alone from personal experience), choose his district, 
and set to work to become the recognized oracle on 
his little portion of the earth's surface. Or again, let 
him specialize on some such subject of general inter- 
est as airships or volcanic eruptions. He has but to 
read some standard work, to subscribe to a press- 
cutting agency, and to file his information neatly : in 
due course he will find his opportunity of enlighten- 
ing the world. Some day he may even write a book 
on his pet subject, and put up his prices accordingly. 
Most of the golf experts have done so already. 

That the trained writer should specialize, is well 
enough; but I have some little grudge against the 
journalist who cannot string together a couple of 
sentences without some blunder in the elements of 
construction. Modern journalism, I think, employs 
too many men who have nothing to recommend 
them but a certain proficiency at other pursuits. And 
these find their way not only into the daily press, 
but into monthly periodicals; they even invade the 
domain of printed books. A cricketer takes out a 
team to Australia or the Cape, and on his return 
must needs publish a fat volume to celebrate the 
occurrence. There is enough bad writing in the 
world already, from various causes ; book-buyers are 



a steadily diminishing class; they should be pro- 
tected from the assault of the incompetent amateur. 
Or perhaps it would serve if the Expert were taught 
the main principles of syntax. He has, in general, 
something to say, if he could say it without harrow- 
ing the soul of the grammarian. I am inclined to 
think, sometimes, that a standard should be set 
for all who aspire to see themselves in print; there 
should be examinations held annually at local cen- 
tres, and no journalist or author should be permitted 
to practise without a diploma. The dentist, in this 
country, must have his license: the writer may set the 
teeth of the whole nation on edge without hindrance.

COMMUNICATIONS. 



LIBRAKIANS' PENSIONS A LIBRARIAN'S VIEW. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Permit me to offer a few remarks on the subject of 
pensions for superannuated librarians, as discussed in 
your " Casual Comment " of August 16. 

Neither legislative enactments nor the philanthropy 
of the millionaires offers even a flicker of expectation 
to librarians in need of pensions. In ihe case of legis- 
lation, the Public will see no reason why librarians, 
before other public servants, should be pensioned out 
of public funds. It would be very difficult to prove 
that librarians occupy a position that renders them 
sufficiently distinctive, whether qua invalids from stress 
and strain or in the role of martyrs to a system of 
insufficient remuneration, to deserve a benefit not gen- 
erally enjoyed by other educational workers. As for 
the philanthropy of the millionaires, let me say that 
while we librarians choose to be servants servants to 
our great cause, servants to the Public, servants even 
to the individuals amongst the Public we also hope to 
prove ourselves free men and women; and to such the 
acceptance of personal charity is quite as painful as is 
the deprivation of opportunities for a full enjoyment of 
legitimate earnings. 

Most of us are plain persons with scant claims for 
distinction of any kind. Few among us possess a 
degree of scholarship equal to that of the average 
member of the learned or literary republic. But what- 
ever we are, is it not evident that we choose our 
vocation, and like it, and submit to the conditions that 
surround it ? Every calling has its own joys and sor- 
rows. We do not expect to have the former sharpened, 
or to have the latter blunted, through the spasmodic 
leniency of a moneyed power. I sincerely believe that 
the greater number of us will not await the maturation 
of a pecuniary endowment before undertaking some 
useful but unremunerative work. I likewise hope we 
shall not be found lingering at the door of men who 
are responsible for the very social conditions through 
which our wages, otherwise a fair recompense, are ren- 
dered insufficient for our decent wants. 

The problem of pensions for librarians had best be 
solved in the natural manner of cooperation. So much 
is known on the subject of old-age pensions and in- 
surance against invalidism, that a single and efficient 
system could easily be found. Libraries as institutions, 
and librarians as individuals, could by their own efforts

build up a pensioning agency which would accoinodate 
us all in a business way, on the evil day when we are 
graciously classed with " worn-out tools " a term that 
we may properly recognize by reminding its users of 
the fact that our toleration, through long exercise, has 
grown quite unlimited. The details of such a pension- 
ing system do not pertain here ; only let me say that 
they include a fund preferably formed by initiation fees, 
an institutional membership contributing in proportion 
to number of employees, a personal membership con- 
tributing in proportion to salary. Some compulsory 
features might attach to these memberships, and the 
business organization of the system might be vested 
with our very efficient national Library Association. 

In some such way we might obtain what is admitted 
to be a dire necessity as long as the rule of millionaires 
prevails and our insane social conditions prevent us from 
personally providing for a care-free old age. It remains 
to be seen whether the necessity is strong enough to 
impel action. I freely admit that some of us are tired 
of awaiting remote possibilities, and are ready to apply 
business principles where tears and hopes hitherto have 
been idly wasted. j Q g

A LIBRARY IN A POWDER MAGAZINE. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The curious beginning of the Chicago Public Library, 
which, according to an interesting note in THE DIAL of 
July 16, was once housed in an abandoned water-tank, 
is matched by the Library of the Louisiana State Uni- 
versity, which had its first quarters in an old powder- 
magazine. The State University occupies the buildings 
and grounds of the old army post at Baton Rouge, 
which was abandoned as a result of the electoral contro- 
versy of 1876-1877. The following extract from Fay's 
" History of Education in Louisiana" gives a description 
of the library as it was from 1886 to 1903. 

" Far off to the northeastern corner of the garrison inclos- 
ure is a long, low building, entirely without windows, save 
for two small grated apertures at each of the narrow ends, 
while for entrance a heavy iron door is swung in the center 
of the southern front, a place more like a prison-house than 
a scholar's quiet domicile among books. Few have ever seen 
such a building ; and as you enter for the first time it fairly 
oppresses you to observe that you pass through a doorway 
whose walls are five or six feet thick. Within, the room 
represents an equally strange sight. Along the walls book- 
shelves extend around the whole parallelogram, save for the 
trifling space of the small windows. The ceiling is so low 
that you can almost touch it at the bookcases, but it rises in 
low heavy arches, only to sink again archwise on massive 
square pillars in the center of the room. Thus are formed two 
long corridors with low arches that fall into a succession of 
vaults down the passage. The central pillars are girt around 
with square bookshelves, all with their burden of volumes. 
" The building was the old powder-magazine of the bar- 
racks when soldiers, and not scholars, were stationed there. 
You would think it dark ; but the whiteness of the ceiling 
counteracts in some measure the deficiency of appertures for 
light, and on fair days, at least, one reads without difficulty 
until after sunset. So thick are the walls that it is cool there 
on hot summer days, and never very cold on the rawest days 
the Southern winter affords." 

Since the books have been removed to a more modern 
structure, the old powder magazine has been used as 
a storage place for agricultural implements, farm pro- 
duce, and Experiment Station publications.

THE YOUNGER LIFE OF FKIEDKICH 
NIETZSCHE.* 



From the all-alive and handsomely presented 
record of Nietzsche's first thirty-two years, as 
given by his sister Frau Forster- Nietzsche, many 
will gain a new impression of a figure which 
popular imagination has vested with a somewhat 
sinister cloud. Everyone must be grateful for 
this proud and lofty nature, that " never fell 
into the clutches of a great passion or of a vul- 
gar love," that gave the impression, at the time 
of its fullest maturity, of " a being who had 
come direct from God's hands, and was not yet 
soiled by the dust of the world." 

Elizabeth Nietzsche, well known as the most 
consistent advocate and furtherer of her 
brother's mission, is at her very best in this 
intimate story of the life she knew so well ; she 
unites a sweetness and vivacity of temper to 
frank reasonableness, and if she idealizes at 
times in showing too ample a belief in the 
plenary sufficiency of Friedrich's message, it 
must also be noted that she nowhere intrudes 
her own personality into the well-proportioned 
portrait of the philosopher. 

In all that touches birth and breeding, 
Nietzsche was a Brahmin of the Brahmins : 
his family record showed a long line of gifted, 
high-minded, cultured ancestors, loyal and con- 
servative; his earliest years were spent in an 
"ideal parsonage'' at Eocken. The humbly- 
proud traditions of a family which " found its 
pleasure in its own resources," which held its 
stock "too good to lie," were fully sustained, 
in all their unpretentious aloofness from vul- 
garity, in the home of the widowed mother, 
who never spoiled her son by a blind maternal 
love. There were no peremptory commands laid 
upon the boy, whose innate purity, nobility, 
and profundity kept him from cheapening the 
family ideals. The household was completely 
dominated by a religious spirit, and at the close 
of his career Nietzsche could say, "The most 
earnest Christians have always been kindly 
disposed to me." It was the boy's intention to 
become, like his ancestors, a Protestant pastor. 

His childhood was indeed enviable, rich in 
affection, responsiveness, variety. A certain 
melancholy and love of solitude was funda- 
mental to his nature, and a serious-mindedness 
in his studies which did not lead to priggishness.

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



Nowhere is there the record of more beauti- 
ful human relations than the perfect companion- 
ship always existing between Friedrich and his 
sprightly and gifted sister, two years younger 
than himself, a partnership in plans, thoughts, 
and interests, passing the comradery between 
Goethe and Cornelia, or of Tom and Maggie 
in "The Mill on the Floss." 

At the age of ten, Nietzsche was already a 
boy of extraordinary gifts, a composer of plays 
and of serious music ; at a very early period we 
find the works of Goethe being used by his wise 
guardian to give him a feeling for what is high- 
est in language and rhythm an element in 
Nietzsche's subsequent power which can hardly 
be overestimated. At fourteen comes a distinct 
change in his course of life, in his departure 
for Pforta, the Rugby of North Germany. The 
educational ideals of this manly institution may 
well excite the envy of those who have at heart 
the education of American boys. About the time 
that young Nietzsche entered, the Rector wrote : 

"Every Pforta boy leaves the institution with the 
definite stamp of a certain sound efficiency which lasts 
him throughout life. . . . Its pupils become complete 
men; they are taught to obey the command and the will 
of their superiors, and are used to the severe and punc- 
tual fulfilment of duty, to self-control, to earnest work, 
to original personal initiative, as a result of individual 
choice in their work and their love of it. They are ac- 
customed to thoroughness and method in their studies, 
to rules in the division of the time at their disposal, and 
to a certain self-confident tact and fairness in intercourse 
with their equals." 

It need scarcely be added, in the words of Nietz- 
sche's sister, that "Pforta was not a school for 
softness, and under no circumstances flattered 
its gifted scholars." As in the English colleges, 
a wide independent reading of the classics was 
considered "the thing " by the pupils themselves. 
Many years after leaving the place, Nietzsche 
wrote of it: 

" The most desirable thing of all is to have severe 
discipline at the age when it makes us proud that peo- 
ple should expect great things of us. ... The same 
discipline makes the soldier and the scholar efficient; 
and, looked at more closely, there is no true scholar 
who has not the instincts of a true soldier in his veins." 

With what avidity the boy craved after uni- 
versality is plain from the interests of which he 
writes : nature, art, languages, classical antiq- 
uity, natural sciences, and religion appeal to 
him, for he was "a reverent animal." Before he 
was seventeen years old, he thus records his re- 
pugnance to attacking the foundations of current 
belief : 

"Oh! destruction is easy, but construction! and even 
destruction seems a lighter task than it really is. ... 
Force of habit, the need of striving after a lofty goal, 



the breach with every existing institution, the dissolution 
of every form of society, the suspicion of the possibility 
of having been misled for two thousand years by a mir- 
age, the sense of one's own arrogance and audacity 
all these considerations fight a determined battle within 
us, until at last painful experiences and sad occurrences 
lead our hearts back to the old beliefs of our childhood." 

A few years later he puts the tragic modern 
crisis before his sister : 

" Is it really so difficult simply to accept everything 
to which one has been brought up, everything which has 
gradually struck deep roots into one's being, which passes 
for truth not only amongst one's relatives but also iu the 
minds of many good men, and in addition to this, really 
comforts and elevates man? . . . It is here then that man 
comes to the cross-roads. Do you desire spiritual peace 
and happiness ? very well, then, believe ! Do you wish 
to be a disciple of truth? so be it ; investigate! " 

The most important elements which came into 
young Nietzsche's life at Pforta were his friend- 
ships for gifted and serious boys, and his pas- 
sion for Greek philology, for poetry and music ; 
he leaves the royal school in 1864, un jeune 
homme bien eleve. 

His first university year, eagerly pursued in 
Bonn, showed an interesting attempt to iden- 
tify himself with the typical student-life, and a 
resultant moral recoil from the coarseness and 
"beer-materialism" of the group. At the Uni- 
versity of Leipzig, which he entered in the fall 
of 1865, his rich temperament came into posses- 
sion of its own under the nourishing influence 
of congenial professors and students. Two of 
the notable forces which wrought here were the 
play-house and the writings of Schopenhauer, 
the prophet of sensibility and subjective emotion. 
During the intolerable months of service in the 
Horse Artillery, and while doing the hardest 
work of the stable, he writes : " Concealed be- 
neath the belly of my steed, I whisper, ' Schopen- 
hauer, help ! ' ' 

At twenty-four years of age the professorship 
of classical philology at Basel is thrust at him, 
so to speak, and the authorities at Leipzig award 
their brilliant pupil his Doctor's degree without 
thesis or oral examination, on lui donneralt 
le bon Dieu sans confession/ 

The productive and enthusiastic first years at 
Basel are adequately shown, with full indications 
as to Nietzsche's devoted activity. As a scholar 
he was intensely serious, but devoid of the slight- 
est vein of ponderousness ; he "detested every 
kind of pose." We have a vivid picture of his 
service as attendant upon a military ambulance 
during the French war, with a significant experi- 
ence which throws a flash-light upon his later 
development : 

"At last came the infantry, advancing at the double! 
The men's eyes were aflame, and their feet struck the

hard road like mighty harnmer-strokes. ' Then,' said 
he, 'I felt for the first time, dear sister, that the strong- 
est and highest Will to Life does not find expression in 
a miserable struggle for existence, but in a Will to War, 
a Will to Power, a Will to Overpower!'" 

Until his health began to fail (about 1875), 
these were full and most happy years; it is 
pleasant to know that during the latter part of 
this professorship his devoted sister was able to 
provide him a thoroughly comfortable home, 
which was a hearth-side for the sprightly inner 
circle of friends, a group, by the way, which 
significantly enough got endless entertainment 
from Mark Twain: something which the body 
of professional "scholars" could not understand 
at all (Emerson, it might be added, had stood 
first on Nietzsche's reading-list at Pforta, and we 
find occasional mention of Longfellow). With- 
out fuller discussion of the details of his work, 
it should be noted that his science, classical 
philology, was to him "the serious aim of a life, 
pursued with ardor and devotion "; more partic- 
ularly was it his life-work to evolve the total 
ultimate significance of Hellenism for the race, 
when brought into vital relation to "the true and 
pressing problems of life"; he had an insuper- 
able hatred for all "philological" pedantry. His 
first book ("The Birth of Tragedy") bitterly 
opposed by many of the leaders of classical stu- 
dies, was an attempt to re-appreciate the entire 
Greek soul. Another of his most trenchant 
" Thoughts out of Season" "called down" Ger- 
man inflation at the close of the war. 

Through these happiest years of his life his 
crown of rejoicing was his friendship for Richard 
Wagner. The gradual breach is well accounted 
for, and makes some sad chapters : not to speak 
of the contemptible professional jealousies of 
Wagner (Nietzsche dared not accept a congenial 
invitation to travel with a son of Felix Mendels- 
sohn !), his demand was for a complete absorption 
of Nietzsche's personality. The great disillusion 
came during the rehearsals at Bayreuth in 1876 : 
he found the Ring des Nibelungen "simply 
exalted intoxication with no suggestion of ex- 
uberant Dionysian vitality"; he was thoroughly 
repelled by "the preponderance of ugliness, 
grotesqueness, and strong pepper." With this 
great disappointment the first volume closes. 

The whole document impresses us with its 
truth, freshness, and immediateness of effect. 
The "ruthless" Nietzsche appears always full 
of delicate consideration for those about him, 
always insistent in his demand for whole-hearted 
friendship ; most characteristic and ingratiating 
is his almost miraculous gift of piano-playing 
a deeper index of his soul, perhaps, than many 



printed books. It is true that we see him be- 
coming the prophet of the glorification of self- 
sufficiency, protesting against "smug routine 
and things allowed," impatient of any confu- 
sion of Immortals and groundlings. If we com- 
pare the bitter class-consciousness of socialistic 
labor-organs with the proud Will-to-Power of 
Nietzsche, we may be terrorized at the prospect 
of an Armageddon which is to try out these 
colliding principles. But it is not necessary to 
take Nietzsche's gospel too seriously; it is sus- 
piciously akin to his "intuition" of an untamed 
strain of noble Polish blood in his veins ; it may 
better be thought of as the fling indulged in by 
the highly-wrought scion of a long strain of 
blameless pastors and model citizens. As a mat- 
ter of fact, our ruddy drop of common humanity 
far outweighs all the surging sea of social dif- 
ferences and contentions. 

Nietzsche was, in a word, a sensitive impres- 
sionist from the womb: impressionist in his 
idealizing of friendships, even in his reaction 
under the stimulus of a German corps-fest! 
He took over from here and there much more 
than he created out of his own vitals; he is a 
sensitive recorder of fleeting moods, but none 
of these facts obscures the moving sadness of 
this man's place in modern thought : 

" between two worlds, one dead, 
The other powerless to be born." 

The translation is to be commended for its 
freshness and the movement of its style, though 
it now and then condescends to trivialities in 
diction, is somewhat uncertain in its English 
idiom, and often exhibits the British dislocation 
of the adverb "only." Those trite stumbling- 
blocks pathetisch and genial appear serenely as 
"pathetic" and "genial" wie gebrduchlich ; 
on page 209 Burckhardt's name is spelled 
wrongly; at the close of page 252 the unrecog- 
nized quotation from Goethe's Hqffnung is 
grotesquely mistranslated.

FORT DEARBORN AND ITS STORY.* 

A hundred years have passed since the Fort 
Dearborn garrison set forth upon the march 
which ended so disastrously among the sand- 
dunes below the river's mouth, and nearly eighty 
years since the rush of immigration to Chicago 
began which marks the birth of the modern 
city. From civilization's remotest outpost, far 
engulfed in the wilderness, Chicago has become,

Seymour. Illustrated. Chicago : A. C. McClurg & Co.

[Sept. 1, 



in that time, the industrial heart of the nation 
and the fifth metropolis of the world. Some 
there are still with us who recall vividly how 
in 1832 the inhabitants of the little settlement 
fled in terror to the sheltering walls of Fort 
Dearborn before the threatened attack of the 
Indian, and then fled forth again in even wilder 
alarm before the deadlier peril of the Asiatic 
cholera. 

Red man and cholera alike have vanished in 
a transformation as astonishing as any in all 
world's history. Probably no other event in 
the city's past so appeals to the imagination of 
the Chicagoan of the present as does the Fort 
Dearborn massacre. The force of this appeal is 
due to the fact that no other event so visualizes 
the gulf which lies between the conditions of the 
present and those of the past, so near in point 
of time, so remote in all other respects. 

To the many narratives of the massacre 
already in print has now been added another ; 
for approximately two-thirds of Mr. Seymour's 
"Story of Old Fort Dearborn" is devoted to 
the story of the massacre and of the conditions 
attendant upon it. It may be pertinent to con- 
sider, therefore, whether the progress which has 
been made in other ways since the occurrence 
of the tragedy is reflected in the accounts which 
have been written of it. Aside from brief con- 
temporary notices, the first of these to see the 
light was the narrative of Mrs. John H. Kinzie, 
which appeared anonymously in pamphlet form 
in 1844, and was incorporated a dozen years 
later in the author's more ambitious literary ven- 
ture, the book " Wau-Bun." For a variety of 
reasons this narrative soon acquired an unusual 
prestige. By the massacre, the Chicago of 1812 
had been blotted out ; the gulf between it and 
the bustling young city of the mid-century was 
bridged only by the representatives of the family 
into which the author had married. Socially 
prominent, her husband a charter member of 
the Chicago Historical Society, not backward 
about pressing the family claims to recognition, 
wielder of a captivating pen, claiming as no other 
could to speak upon the authority of participants 
in the massacre, there was none to rival her 
narrative. It was frequently paraphrased and 
quoted by other writers, and seems to have been 
regarded as containing all that could be known 
on the subject. 

For a generation after its first appearance its 
validity was not publicly challenged, although 
it is worthy of note that the indefatigable Lyman 
C. Draper procured for preservation in his col- 
lection the judgment of the wife of Captain 



Heald, who died in 1857, that Mrs. Kinzie's 
account was " exaggerated and incorrect in its 
relation of the Chicago massacre." At length, 
however, some dissent from the general chorus 
of approval of its validity was manifested. In 
his quaint " Chicago Antiquities," Hurlbut 
some thirty years ago wrote himself down as a 
heretic in the matter in question, and a dozen 
years later Kirkland's "Chicago Massacre " ex- 
pressed the conviction that Mrs. Kinzie's narra- 
tive " reads like a romance and was meant so to 
be read." Since then no other historian has 
entered the lists in support of these two, and the 
vogue of the "Wau-Bun " narrative still per- 
sists. No one who would understand the lit- 
erature of the Chicago massacre, including the 
present work, can ignore it, for it is the fountain- 
head from which practically all other accounts 
have proceeded ; while locally the public mind 
has become obsessed with it, as formerly on a 
national scale with the stories of the youthful 
Washington told by Mason Locke Weems. Yet 
from the serious historical viewpoint, the defects 
of the work are numerous and glaring. The 
perspective is distorted, the language extrava- 
gant, the antipathies displayed are violent. 
Motives are explained, orders reported, and con- 
versations retailed, which if they ever had a basis 
in fact could not possibly have been known to 
the author, in a way which might well excite the 
envy of the sober historian whose activities are 
limited by the necessity of finding an authority 
for his statements. 

To estimate "Wau-Bun" is to estimate the 
present work, for, the introductory portion aside, 
it is for the most part but a paraphrase of the 
earlier account. Rarely does the author's con- 
fidence in his leader falter. In many instances 
even errors of detail, which might readily have 
been corrected by reference to well-known 
sources, are repeated. He finds a qualified 
justification for the course of Captain Heald 
(pp. 55-56, 105-106), but there is no more 
basis for the judgment expressed of him than 
for the sweeping condemnation by Mrs. Kinzie. 
Even the most fanciful portions of the earlier 
narrative cause the author no hesitation. He 
repeats the grotesque story of the experiences of 
Sergeant Griffith (pp. 161-162), and defends 
the cruel and incredible tale of the death of Doc- 
tor Van Voorhis (pp. 143-145). His mental atti- 
tude is perhaps best illustrated by his treatment 
of the evacuation order. If it be conceded that 
his excuse of ignorance of the character of the 
order offered in behalf of the mistatements of 
Mrs. Kinzie which are based upon it is a valid

one, no such defense can be advanced for the 
author himself, who, in the face of full knowl- 
edge of the wording of the order, persists in re- 
peating a number of these misstatements. Since 
the order enjoined the destruction of the arms 
and ammunition, it is obvious that the story 
that Heald promised to distribute the latter to 
the Indians, from which piece of folly he was 
diverted only by the remonstrances of Kinzie 
(pp. 110-111), together with the statements 
concerning the resentment of the Indians over 
Heald 's "deception" when they discovered that 
they were not to receive the ammunition (pp. 
118-119), are inventions. 

The book abounds in errors of detail. La 
Salle reached the mouth of the Mississippi on 
April 9 instead of April 7, 1682 (p. 9) ; Fort 
St. Joseph was within the limits of the modern 
town of Niles instead of at the mouth of the St. 
Joseph River (p. 21); the construction of thefirst 
Fort Dearborn did not begin on July 4 (p. 22), 
for the troops arrived at Chicago only on Aug- 
ust 17; nor was the fort ready for occupancy 
"later" in the summer (p. 25). On the con- 
trary, in December the soldiers were still living 
in temporary huts, and the fort was reported as 
"not much advanced." John Whistler did not 
remain in America at the close of the Revolution 
and marry in Maryland (p. 34) ; rather, he re- 
turned to England on his release from captivity, 
where he eloped with a neighbor's daughter and 
came again to America. After leaving Fort 
Dearborn in 1810 he was transferred not to 
Fort Wayne (p. 34) but to Fort Detroit. The 
services of General Dearborn on the Niagara 
frontier were doubtless "distinguished" (p. 50), 
but hardly so in the sense intended by the au- 
thor. The battle of the Thames occurred Octo- 
ber 5 instead of October 6 (p. 67); the murders 
at the Lee farm were on April 6 instead of 
April 7 (p. 75) ; and the name of the Frenchman 
who was killed there was not Debou but John B. 
Cardin. The news of the declaration of war 
reached Fort Dearborn some time before August 
7 (p. 102), and Winnemeg did not arrive with 
the evacuation order until August 9. Instead 
of being nearly as old as Captain Wells (p. 141), 
Mrs. Heald was but twenty-two in 1812. Mrs. 
Helm does not mention any fighting done by Van 
Voorhis (pp. 143-144), whether "gallantly" or 
otherwise. Lieutenant Helm was not a prisoner 
prior to the general surrender (p. 147). Surgeon 
John Cooper was not accompanied " by his wife 
and two young daughters," nor was he among 
the slain (p. 153) ; on the contrary he was un- 
married, he had resigned the service and left 



Fort Dearborn over a year before, and he died 
peacefully in Poughkeepsie, New York, fifty-two 
years later. 

Let it be understood, however, that our gen- 
eral estimate of the book is not determined by 
these and other errors of detail which space 
fails us to mention ; rather it is conditioned by 
the author's attitude toward his subject, which 
reveals no evidence of the exercise of a critical 
faculty. It can hardly be supposed that the 
last word on the Fort Dearborn massacre was 
spoken by the first person who undertook to 
narrate its story. Handicapped as she was by 
the absence of libraries and the collections of 
historical societies, without access to government 
archives, relying for her information upon the 
recollections and traditions current in a single 
family, herself in no sense a trained investigator, 
it would be remarkable indeed if such were the 
case. The historian who to-day assumes the 
attitude that it was, may perhaps entertain, but 
he can hardly instruct, his readers.

THE LYRIC IN ENGLISH POETRY.* 



, Professor Edward Bliss Reed is the first critic 
to attempt to give an account of the history of 
the English lyric. We have volumes dealing 
with one aspect or another of the subject 
Sharp's study of the sonnet, Professor Schelling's 
Introduction to " Elizabethan Lyrics," Mr. 
Chambers's " Essay on the Mediaeval Lyric "; 
but almost all such essays are prefaces to collec- 
tions of poetry, not historical studies. A certain 
trial has already been made of Professor Reed's 
volume, for it is a working-over of lectures given, 
for a series of years, to college seniors. The 
arrangement of topics in the ten chapters is 
according to the periods of literary history Old 
English, Middle English, Tudor, Elizabethan, 
and on to " The Lyric of To-day," where Steven- 
son, Henley, Francis Thompson, John David- 
son, Mr. Watson, Mr. Kipling, and other poets, 
receive discriminating tribute. 

One is impressed immediately by the orderly 
arrangement of the volume. No personal enthu- 
siasms have led Prof essor Reed to over-emphasize 
any of the poets ; he has shown an admirable 
sense of proportion. Only in a few cases is a 
reader likely to take issue with the critic's judg- 
ments, for time-honored favorites are given ap-

preciative comment in a way which assures us 
that he has a keen and sensitive enjoyment of 
lyric poetry. Many passages there are which 
reveal his intuitive penetration, whether he is 
discussing "The Seafarer" or Herrick's master- 
pieces, Blake's mysticism or Landor's lonely 
classicism. Both for breadth of sympathy and 
for depth of knowledge of literature, Professor 
Reed has the right to our most respectful atten- 
tion. He writes in an easy conversational man- 
ner, sometimes rising to passages of intensely 
interesting appreciation. One feels constantly 
that he knows his subject, that his observations 
are based upon long study of the poets as well as 
upon the judgment of other critics. At the pres- 
ent time, when there is such a decline in the pro- 
duction of the genuine lyric, it is pleasant to 
think that a book like this must of necessity 
quicken-appreciation of poetry and serve as guide 
to finer standards of taste. There is undoubted 
place for this history, not only in colleges but in 
the larger world. 

Anyone who publishes a work on the lyric 
must face the difficult task of so defining the 
type as to silence envious tongues. It is agreed 
that the lyric is our most perfect poetry. Pro- 
fessor Reed's definition, as he summarizes it, is 
this : 

"All songs; all poems following classic lyric forms; 
all short poems expressing the writer's moods and feel- 
ings in a rhythm that suggests music, are to be considered 
lyrics. This threefold statement is not free from ambi- 
guity, and does not remove all the difficulties that arise 
in determining whether or not a given poem is to be con- 
sidered a lyric." 

And further : 

" To sing with the infinite harmonies of rhythm and 
the melodies of rhyme ; to move by dim suggestion or to 
appeal with overpowering passion directly to the. feel- 
ings; to present thoughts suffused with emotion or ideas 
that concern the reason chiefly; to summon before the 
reader's mind, by ' the magic incantation of a verse,' ex- 
quisite colors and forms ; to touch the memory and stir 
the imagination this is but a faint description of the 
art of the lyric poet." 

In this charmingly phrased definition it is 
evident that the critic narrows his subject, em- 
phasizing the song quality overmuch; and one 
is not surprised to find that he rules out of con- 
sideration such poems as "Adonais" and "In 
Memoriam." Of course this has long been a 
debated question ; but if the lyric is an expres- 
sion, primarily, of emotion, can we classify these 
two poems as epic ? Length is no final criterion 
of the lyric. Regarding " In Memoriam " as a 
series of lyrics, do we not more fully grasp its 
true significance as a musical outpouring of 
Tennyson's enduring feeling? Grief as well as 



joy is the true matter of a lyric, and when we 
have love, grief, self-hate, a slowly dawning 
sense of brotherhood, and hope, all expressed in 
musical stanzas, with the aid of imagery subdued 
but always immediately effective, have we not 
lyric poetry? And can those magnificent lines in 
"Adonais" that soar into the empyrean of im- 
aginative passion, be anything but lyric, as they 
set the reader quivering in an emotional response 
which transcends any effect known to the epic? 
Depth and intensity belong to the lyric, and a 
strong note of ardent complex life often destroys 
the extreme clarity which to many people is an 
essential to true lyric poetry. 

Inasmuch as the lyric is personal, individual, 
temperamental, we cannot hope for a philosophy 
of its evolution. Only here and there can we 
trace obligations such as that of Herrick to Ben 
Jonson, or Keats to Shakespeare, or Arnold to 
Wordsworth; or such influences as appear at 
times when certain conventions are dominant in 
an age. The interdependences of the religious 
lyric in the Middle Ages, the vogue of the son- 
net in Shakespeare's day, or the triumph of the 
ode in the eighteenth century, may receive atten- 
tion ; but there is absolutely no way of finding 
one central underlying principle of literary evo- 
lution in the lyric. A book dealing with that 
theme must be more or less mechanical, moving 
by decades rather than by analysis of the develop- 
ment and growth of a stated form. The sonnet, 
the ode, may be treated with close investigation 
of shaping artistic process ; but in the general 
subject of lyric it must be a study of men, iso- 
lated, more or less unrelated. 

It is in this biographical, historical side of 
criticism that Professor Reed excels, rather than 
in the more aesthetic examination of art-impulse 
and of art-product. Although he continually 
refers to the external art-form, he does not, in 
many places, give us exact analysis of the sources 
of our enjoyment of this special beauty. Idea, 
feeling, rather more than expression, is his con- 
cern, and one cannot fail to be somewhat dis- 
appointed that so little is done to reveal this 
mystery of creation where the imagination is 
supreme. The typical creative process, through 
the medium of the concrete, be it by simile, 
metaphor, personification, or by simple allusion, 
should be expounded if we are to understand 
the real significance of the lyric. Close study, 
at the outset, of a few representative poems 
would have illustrated the fundamental truths 
of the lyric impulse and its expression, and the 
reader would have been quickened to appreciate 
the illumination of spiritual experience through 



1912.]

sensuous appeals. As it is, these things are 
taken too much for granted, so that the reader 
really zealous for understanding must work out 
his own salvation, if he is to gain a right con- 
ception of the quick, passionate, imaginative 
beauty of lyric poetry. Some critical training 
must be the prelude to the deeper enjoyment of 
any art ; and as knowledge of technique of line, 
color, grouping, increases the pleasure in a paint- 
ing, so a knowledge of how to read, with the 
imagination trained and alert, is a preparation 
for keener perception of poetic form. 

It occasionally appears that the critic himself 
fails, in this book, to respond to the appeals to 
eye and ear, and for this reason expresses opin- 
ions which may arouse dissent. In discussing 
Donne, Herbert, and Wither, there is too little 
said about the kind of imagery employed, too 
little effort to vitalize the wayward and pictur- 
esque beauty of the "Metaphysical School." 
Undoubtedly it does err on the side of the gro- 
tesque, but there is a richness of sensuous per- 
ception and a lofty spirit of symbolic meaning 
which we should cherish. George Herbert's 
poems are more full of keen and suggestive 
metaphor than the critic would lead one to sup- 
pose, and the conventional quotations from his 
work are not enough to illustrate his delight in 
symbolism, as in 

" Man is no star, but a quick coal 

Of mortal fire; 
Who blows it not, nor doth control 

A faint desire, 
Lets his own ashes choke his soul." 

Wither, too, is treated rather unkindly, for 
his work has constant surprises of challenging 
figure; even when he pictures love he gives a 
"metaphysical" addition, 

" Great men have helps to gain 
Those favors they implore; 
Which, though I win with pain, 
I find my joys the more. 

Each clown may rise, 

And climb the skies, 
When he hath found a stair; 

But joy to him 

That dares to climb, 
And hath no help but air." 

When we read that Shelley's 
" Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air " 

is " an immortal line " and " one of the treasures 
of English literature," there is justification for 
irritated denial. The line is one of Shelley's 
weakest, offending the imagination by its ludi- 
crous personification of feeding buds, a figure 
which degrades nature. Mr. Reed regards the 



musical element as predominant, and does not 
give due importance to the fact that there must 
be the appeal of visible and tangible as well as 
of audible in poetry. This lack of visualization 
is apparent when he quotes, 

" When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang," 

and then refers to " the grays and blacks " of 
the poem. 

In placing Keats's " Ode to Sorrow " above 
the " Grecian Urn," he exalts an abstract 
eighteenth-century manner and a jingling 
rhythm above a singularly poignant and imag- 
inative lyric, where a remarkable power of in- 
terpretative vision is allied with a serene and 
haunting music. So too, in the discussion of the 
sonnets of Sidney and of Rossetti, the extracts 
quoted are all too often the less tremendous 
instances of a power of lyric expression which 
seized hold upon concrete images and gave them 
matchless music. Sidney's sonnet on the Moon, 
will by some critics not be considered " his fin- 
est," but because of its artificial sentiment will 
be placed below that nobler one, 

" Leave me, O Love, which reachest but to dust." 

In the case of Rossetti, a somewhat unfair esti- 
mate is made of his art when the critic writes : 
" Browning's lovers meet under the open sky, 
but Rossetti takes us to a dim room, where we 
are overpowered by the incense burning at a 
shrine to Venus Victrix." It is true that the 
fervid Italian temperament of Rossetti enjoyed 
a certain richness of effect, but in the " House 
of Life " the majority of the figures used refer 
to nature, and keep the reader surrounded by 
the appeal of sun and wind and wave. What 
could be more powerful and more dominated by 
the finest spiritual truth of love than the lines 
in "The Dark Glass," 
" Shall birth and death, and all dark names that be 

As doors and windows bared to some loud sea, 

Lash deaf mine ears and blind my face with spray ; 
And shall my sense pierce love, the last relay 

And ultimate outpost of eternity ? " 

It is inexplicable that no mention is made of 
" The Monochord " or of "The Portrait," where 
the mystic yearning of Rossetti's love is revealed 
in utmost sensitiveness. It is odd, too, that in 
the account of Christina Rossetti, giving warm 
tribute to her superiority over Mrs. Browning, 
the most musical of her lyrics is not quoted, 
those stanzas full of concrete appeal and of deep 
elemental feeling, 

" When I am dead, my dearest, 

Sing no sad songs for me ; 
Plant thou no roses at my head, 

Nor shady cypress tree:

I shall not hear the nightingale 

Sing on, as if in pain; 
And dreaming through the twilight 

That doth not rise nor set,

And haply may forget." 

There are destined to be omissions in a work 
as brief as this, and if Emily Bronte is neglected 
while Stevenson's " Child's Garden of Verses " 
receives a surprisingly ample notice, one must 
be content. The vogue of Ernest Dowson's facile 
verses hardly warrants including his name in a 
work which omits Eugene Lee-Hamilton and 
Mr. Stephen Phillips, who have a genuine hold 
on life. The rigid exclusion of Irish authors robs 
the history of what would have been particularly 
important, the interpretation of the grave preci- 
sion of Lionel Johnson's work and an account 
of the symbolic, impetuous beauty in the poems 
of Mr. William Butler Yeats. These poets are 
partly English, by traditions of lyric art. 

Even if the epic manner has been too frequent 
in this book on the lyric, readers will find it 
both stimulating and steadying. Every lover of 
lyric poetry ought to read it, and meditate over 
it, for it is a loyal voicing of faith that the beauty 
of the English lyric is imperishable, despite 
" The wreckful siege of battering days."

THE " NEW IDEA " IN STATE 
GOVERNMENT.* 



Something more than a hundred years ago, 
the government of the United States was set 
up by the privileged classes. Its constitutions 
were consciously and purposely shaped for the 
restraint of excessive democracy. Although 
they did this while talking of the right to life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, it is not 
fair to assume that the Fathers were outright 
thieves or canting hypocrites. Probably the 
majority of them honestly believed that such an 
arrangement was for the best interest of all the 
people. Did they not say that every man should 
have a chance? And did they not give every 
man at least most white men a chance, by

erick C. Howe, Ph.D. New York : Charles Scribner's Sons. 



the absence of a caste system ? Land-ownership 
and all industries were open, and political power 
was neither hereditary nor subject to any reli- 
gious test. What more could the laissezfaire 
philosophy do? It had taken away the legal 
right of the government to hold a man down by 
Force and by the hereditary claim of some to 
ride on the shoulders of others. That one man 
might, through the possession of Force (economic 
power), mount on the shoulders of others was 
no concern of the government. It had given 
them the legal right to dismount him and rise 
by the same Force if only they could get it. 

The great expanse of open land and the ap- 
parently unlimited resources of our country en- 
abled men to escape in part from this Force for 
a time. But with the ever-narrowing frontier, 
and the rapid strides of inventions which were 
protected by government patent and increased 
the Force of the few, escape became more and 
more difficult. After the Civil War, the gov- 
ernment became still more closely allied with 
privilege. Indeed, Big Business stepped in and 
took charge, arrogating to itself special favors 
through the tariff, land grants, and banking 
privileges. Our government became, more dis- 
tinctly than ever, one of the people by and for 
the privileged few who wield the economic Force 
of the land. 

At last the people began to realize that they 
were not getting a square deal, and to demand 
that their governments, both state and national, 
be wrested from the hands of the privileged few. 
Many problems were thought to be beyond the 
competence of the states, and more and more 
was demanded of the national government. But 
some still had confidence in the states, and boldly 
struck out to obtain at least partial relief through 
them. Noteworthy achievements have been ac- 
complished in several states ; but nowhere have 
the results been more remarkable than in Wis- 
consin. That state has become an experimental 
laboratory, and the nation is looking on to see 
the process and obtain the results of the work- 
ing out of the Wisconsin Idea. So great is the 
interest in this that two books have appeared 
almost simultaneously with the design of par- 
tially satisfying the desire of the nation to know 
about this new Idea in government. 

What the Wisconsin Idea is, Mr. Charles 
McCarthy, the author of one of these books, 
tells us in a few sentences. It is, in effect, that 
there should be no drones living off the toil of 
the many ; that "prosperity exists for the benefit 
of the human being, and for no other purpose." 
"If prosperity does not uplift the mass of hu- 



1912.] 



135 



man beings, it is not true prosperity, however 
it may be counterfeited by a grand show of fair 
cities or the glory of its riches." Our civiliza- 
tion, he thinks, must be made to serve the wel- 
fare of each individual. The way to do this is 
to drive out the cheating rascals who have acted 
as judges ; protect the weak against the wielders 
of Force ; provide honest markets and exchanges 
and means of transportation; and, finally, to 
teach the Man his rights as well as his duties 
as a citizen. 

Only a few of the things undertaken by 
Wisconsin for the realization of this end can be 
as much as named here. It has regulated the 
railroads and other public utility corporations 
so as to make them the servants and not the 
masters of the people. It has done this, not by 
prescribing in rigid law minute rules and regu- 
lations that all must follow whether applicable 
to them or not, but by creating a commission 
and empowering and requiring it to see that the 
corporations furnish adequate service at reason- 
able rates and without discrimination. Seventy- 
five years ago, in the Priestly case, the courts 
of England established the doctrine of assumed 
risks in industrial accidents, and this doctrine 
was quickly introduced by our courts into this 
country and by them was widely extended . At 
last Wisconsin created a commission to investi- 
gate the whole subject of personal injury, indus- 
trial insurance, and workmen's compensation. 
After a painstaking study, it presented a report 
which resulted in laws shifting the cost of in- 
jury and pioneering the way for State Insurance 
in America. New York enacted a Workmen's 
Compensation act, only to have it declared 
unconstitutional on antiquated grounds. Wis- 
consin avoided the shoals of constitutionality by 
making it voluntary for employers to operate 
under the law, though virtually putting a pen- 
alty on them for not doing so. Her law stands, 
and has been copied by nine other states. Mr. 
McCarthy thinks the Employer's Liability Law 
the "greatest piece of legislation yet put forth 
in Wisconsin, and one which may be a long 
stride toward the solution of the whole indus- 
trial accident problem in America." Through 
the tax commission, and responsive legislation, 
tax burdens have been equalized with astonish- 
ing boldness and surprising justice. The latest 
experiment in taxation is the Income Tax law 
of 1911, the outcome of which will be awaited 
with interest, since our state income tax laws 
have been failures almost without exception. 
To be awarded a gold medal by the International 
Anti- Tuberculosis Association for the best law 



for the prevention or control of tuberculosis is 
an achievement worth while. 

Much of this has been accomplished by 
"calling in the expert," as Mr. Howe says. 
The experts have come mainly from the Uni- 
versity, which has become the " nerve centre " 
of the state, impelling it to intelligent action 
in many fields. It does this in two ways: by 
sending out graduates indoctrinated with the 
principles of good government, and filled with 
enthusiasm for it and by furnishing men for ex- 
pert administrative work. In 1910-11, seven 
members of the instructional force were giving 
a part of their time to public service, and were 
being paid for both; twenty-three others had 
definite official positions without any definite 
combination arrangement ; thirteen others, be- 
sides various members of the medical faculty, 
were serving the state bureaus in various ways 
when called upon; and four state officers were 
serving on the University staff without further 
compensation. Except from the members of 
the " old guard," who do not like to see them- 
selves displaced, the chief complaint seems to be, 
not that these men are grafting, but that the 
stranger never knows where to find them 
whether at the statehouse or the University. 

But the greatest service of the University has 
been in the democratization of learning and its 
application to the needs of everyday life. Its 
theory is that if the boy is to become a brick- 
layer he should be taught something more than 
how to lay bricks ; he should be taught buying, 
architecture, and the essentials which will pre- 
pare him for service in the civic body. After 
enumerating a dozen or more things such as 
improving seed-corn, grasses, orchards, the breed 
of horses and cattle, and giving a great impulse 
to the dairy industry Mr. McCarthy says: 
"The question arises at once, ' But isn't all this 
materialistic? Doesn't the University of Wis- 
consin spell 'cow'?" With refreshing frank- 
ness, he answers: "And what of it?" He is 
fully convinced that all this is worth while in 
itself, but that mere learning will be the gainer 
from it also. 

One of the remarkable things about the 
matter is that all of this has been accomplished 
without any such devices as the initiative, refer- 
endum, and recall, on which so much emphasis 
is laid in other progressive states, particularly 
Oregon, California, and Oklahoma. Not until 
last year was an initiative and referendum 
amendment passed for submission to the people, 
and its form shows that it was designed merely 
to supplement, not to supplant, the legislature.

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



Through the efforts of Mr. La Follette and his 
co-workers, and by means of a primary-election 
law, the people recovered their state government 
several years ago. Now they have confidence 
in their legislature, because it goes about legis- 
lation in a scientific way and has accomplished 
good results. Both Mr. McCarthy and Mr. 
Howe attribute this to the large German ele- 
ment in the state. These people fled from op- 
pression, and brought with them the scientific 
spirit. They saw that the great private interests 
won, not so much because of bribery as through 
the employment of experts who used skill in 
drafting bills and then backed them up with 
arguments which the ordinary legislator could 
not refute. The legislator was not hopelessly 
bad ; no one was there to answer specious argu- 
ments, or to point out the vicious features of 
bad bills. So the expert was called in against 
the expert, and a legislative reference library 
was created, where bills can be drafted with 
care, and information supplied on all sides. 
Probably more credit is due to this bureau than 
Mr. McCarthy, who has had charge of it since 
its creation, modestly claims. 

Both Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Howe are filled 
with enthusiasm for their subject, and they have 
given us a very roseate picture of the results 
achieved. It does not appear that they have 
overdrawn the results in any case, but they have 
said very little about what yet remains to be 
accomplished. Both books furnish stimulative 
reading, and will be helpful to the serious stu- 
dent. Because he goes more into detail, and 
quotes more freely from statutes and reports, 
Mr. McCarthy's work will be more helpful to 
the legislator seeking precedents ; but the latter 
will do well to have both books close at hand.

class by itself. Since Haeckel's early essays in 
this direction, no one has had the temerity to 
undertake the working out of so elaborate and 
comprehensive a family tree for the animal 
kingdom as is here set forth. While the main 
problem of this magnum, opus is the phylogeny 
of the vertebrates, the author finds it necessary 
or at least advisable before he finishes, to 
bring into the purview of his theory the whole 
animal world from the lowest to the highest 
forms. Briefly stated, Dr. Patten's thesis, to 
the elaboration and support of which he has 
given the best part of his working life, is that 
those animals characterized by a backbone, or 
vertebral column, are the direct descendants, 
in the process of evolution, of the class of 
animals known as arachnids, which include such 
creatures as spiders, scorpions, and the horse- 
shoe crab. Now if one accepts the doctrine of 
evolution at all, as most people do, it is pefectly 
certain that the vertebrates must at some time 
have evolved from a preexisting invertebrate 
form. Various theories have been advanced 
from time to time in regard to which particular 
invertebrate class was thus distinguished in the 
evolutionary process. No one of these theories 
has ever found universal acceptance among 
zoologists, and Dr. Patten's is not likely to be 
more fortunate than its predecessors, though 
it must be said that never has so cogent, com- 
prehensive, and well-sustained an argument 
been brought forward in favor of any particular 
invertebrate ancestor as that presented in this 
book. The difficulty confronting acceptance 
lies not in the argument so much as in the 
premises on which it is built. While Dr. Patten 
argues vigorously, even at times warmly, in sup- 
port of the method of comparative morphology 
as a means of arriving at the truth respecting 
the course of phylogeny, it nevertheless remains 
a fact that biology gave this method a thorough 
and fair trial over a long period of years and 
found it essentially weak so far as concerns 
this particular point of phylogenetic synthesis. 
In the language of the bench, the data of com- 
parative morphology lack "probative value." 
No biologist can fail to admire the patient, 
careful, and painstaking toil which has gone into 
the researches on which this book is based, nor 
the brilliant genius for morphological investi- 
gation which is displayed on nearly every page ; 
yet the final verdict on the main thesis, in spite 
of all this, must be " not proven." 

"Plant Life and Evolution," by Professor 
Douglas Houghton Campbell, forms one of the 
volumes on "The Philosophy of Nature" in the

THE DIAL 



"American Nature Series." The book is essen- 
tially an attempt to illustrate the general prin- 
ciples of organic evolution by reference to plants 
rather than animals. No American botanist is 
better qualified to undertake such a task than 
the author. The result is a valuable addition to 
the elementary popular literature on evolution. 
Following the introductory chapters on elemen- 
tary biological matters and the factors of evolu- 
tion, a rather detailed account is given of the 
course of evolution in the plant kingdom. In 
these chapters the author is at his best. A chap- 
ter on Adaptation gives an excellent review of 
the rich material offered by plants for the illus- 
tration of this fundamental characteristic of liv- 
ing things. This leads up to an account of the 
distribution of plants on the earth, and the fac- 
tors which have influenced it. The part which 
man has played, through his practise of the art 
of agriculture, in controlling the evolution of do- 
mesticated plants, is discussed. The final chap- 
ter deals in general terms, and very briefly, with 
the various general theories of evolution. 

To the series of "Cambridge Manuals of 
Science and Literature " a volume entitled "The 
Coming of Evolution" is contributed by the dis- 
tinguished geologist, Professor John W. Judd. 
The story of the part played by the geologists, 
particularly Lyell, in laying the solid founda- 
tion for the idea of organic evolution, by demon- 
strating the fact of evolution in the inorganic 
world, is told in a very genial and entertaining 
manner. The last chapters review Darwin's life 
and give a critical estimate of the significance 
of his work. 

"The Theories of Evolution," by Professor 
Yves Delage and Mile. Marie Goldsmith, is an 
English translation of a work which has been 
very popular in France in the original Flam- 
marian edition, and rather widely read elsewhere. 
The chief claim of the work to distinction rests 
on its detailed presentation of the Lamarckian 
viewpoint. This doctrine, which Darwin once 
called "nonsense" (though he afterward appar- 
ently came to look more graciously upon it), 
contends essentially that the direct effects of 
the environment on organisms not only may be 
inherited, but are inherited, and that in such 
inheritance is to be found a vera causa, if not 
indeed the chief cause, of organic evolution. It 
is to the French that we have long been accus- 
tomed to look for the most ardent advocacy of 
this viewpoint. All biologically inclined French- 
men appear to regard it a fundamental patri- 
otic duty to inherit their acquired characters. 
No more forceful presentation of the Lamarck- 



ian arguments has ever been made than that 
contained in this book, of which one of the most 
distinguished of French zoologists is the senior 
author. But still the case is just as weak as 
ever at the essential point namely, in concrete 
experimental demonstrations that acquired char- 
acters (in the technical sense) are really inherited. 
The evidence that they are has never yet been 
able to withstand completely and satisfactorily 
the searching criticism which has been brought 
to bear upon it. 

Mr. Joseph McCabe, the well-known writer 
of popular treatises on evolution, and the trans- 
lator of Haeckel, has produced another volume, 
"The Story of Evolution," which has a strong 
family resemblance to his previous output. This 
book aims to tell the story of evolution "from 
the ground up." It begins, like Genesis, with 
primitive chaos, and ends with the future of man- 
kind. Like the traditional German definition 
of English philosophy, it has length and breadth. 
Written with a good deal of literary skill, it is 
"easy" reading. The field covered, however, 
is so wide including physical and geological 
evolution as well as organic that the treatment 
cannot be, of necessity, anything but extremely 
superficial. The objectionable feature of this 
type of "popular" science is the altogether false 
perspective in regard to the method of science 
which it tends to emphasize.

THE HISTORY AND ROMANCE OF 
FURNITURE.* 



Furniture, as the term is employed by mod- 
ern writers, is applied to those movable articles 
used in the home for personal rest, work, and 
pleasure, or for the storing of household requi- 
sites and ornament. These articles are almost 
invariably of wood, because of all the materials 
applicable to the interior construction and 
adornment of the home wood has been and 
still is man's" first favourite and proven friend." 
The history of furniture is therefore largely the 
history of man's adaptation of wood to his home 
needs and adornments. This history begins with 
his initial step in the direction of civilization, 
and has developed with his home-making in- 
stinct. It has been influenced by climate, and

thus Europe rather than the Orient presents 
the chief field for its study. The Oriental still 
seeks rest upon rugs spread upon the floor ; and 
while floor coverings have been brought to the 
highest state of perfection in the East, little is 
to be found there in the way of furniture. 

Because of its close human association, fur- 
niture has become invested with a romance as 
well as a history. And because in its evolution 
it has engaged the attention of those skilled in 
the art of design, an added interest has been 
given to it, and thus it has become the object 
of the art student's and connoisseur's and col- 
lector's zeal. So it has come to pass that of 
late years a literature of the subject has been 
developed, closely related to books on arts and 
crafts, though the sumptuousness of the volumes 
places them more in the category of art books. 

The two works now before us contain the 
latest word, full and complete, on the subject 
of historic furniture. Miss Singleton is an 
acknowledged expert in this field. Of the 
numerous art guides she has written, five are 
upon furniture. Her present volume seems to 
be largely a compilation from her former books, 
intended to summarize and present a comprehen- 
sive view of the subject ; and she does this in a 
systematic and scientific manner. She is chiefly 
concerned with the classification of furniture 
by styles and schools ; and her first chapter, on 
that division of the subject, is as long as any two 
of the subsequent chapters. She finds furniture 
divisible, as architecture might be, into national 
styles, Egyptian, Greek, Roman, Byzantine, 
Romanesque, and Gothic ; and the French and 
English styles are further capable of subdivis- 
ion by the political epochs in those countries. 
She also brings to notice a style called genre 
auriculaire, from the ear-shaped ornament em- 
ployed. The most interesting " schools " are 
named after the great eighteenth-century de- 
signers, Adam, Heppelwhite, Sheraton, and the 
three Chippendales. Her subsequent chapters 
are more specifically devoted to the development 
of the different articles of furniture, showing the 
evolution of one style out of its predecessor ; and 
the foreign influences, Chinese at one time, 
affecting the design of English furniture. Her 
final chapter, upon mirrors, screens, and clocks, 
exhibits the wide range of her subject. One 
hundred and nineteen full-page half-tones from 
photographs of furniture in the Metropolitan 
Museum and in the chief museums in Europe, 
and sixty-one text illustrations, help to make 
her volume a very satisfactory guide to a knowl- 
edge of the history of furniture. 



Mr. Edwin Foley covers the same broad field, 
but in a different way, and apparently with a 
different object in view. He is an artist to 
whom the picturesque features of furniture make 
the strongest appeal, and emphasis is laid on the 
word "Decorative" in the title he has chosen for 
his two large volumes. Pie regards furniture 
chiefly as a manifestation of the art of the wood- 
worker, and aims to give a survey of the world's 
beautiful woodwork. He gives an account of 
British domestic woodwork from the time of the 
introduction of printing into England and the 
building up of the home life, to the beginning 
of the nineteenth century; with subordinate 
accounts of French, Italian, German, Flemish, 
Spanish, and Oriental furniture. His enthusi- 
asm for the English woodwork is manifest from 
his frequent reference to the eras of oak and 
walnut and mahogany in England, and the ex- 
tent to which he illustrates the different kinds 
of wood used in the construction and decoration 
of furniture. He scarcely refers to upholstery, 
or recognizes it as essential to furniture. The 
hundred full-page illustrations are from the au- 
thor's own paintings, reproduced in color and 
mounted on gray cartridge paper ; and included 
among them are illustrations of different varieties 
of wood employed by the cabinet-makers, show- 
ing most accurately the peculiarities of their 
grain and color. The thousand text drawings 
are admirably illustrative of the different kinds 
of ornament and carving used. Further aids to 
a right understanding of the history of furniture 
are furnished in charts, tables, and diagrams, 
which show the evolution of the different articles 
of furniture, the different styles, the era in which 
each flourished, the different kinds of ornament 
employed, together with a glossary of terms 
and a bibliography. Altogether the volumes 
are made upon a very generous plan, with large 
pages, large type, and profuse illustrations. The 
lover of pictures, the connoisseur, the art stu- 
dent will find here much to interest and instruct. 
As reference volumes upon all matters connected 
with furniture, there can be no question of their

"The Strangling of Persia" (Cen- 

. tu T Co ') is a title th ^t well describes 
the remorseless doing -to -death of 
constitutional government which Mr. W. Morgan 
Shuster witnessed in the short term of his service 
as Treasurer- General at Teheran. Invited by the 
Persian Cabinet, through its Minister of Foreign 
Affairs, to undertake the straightening-out of that 
country's tangled revenue system, Mr. Shuster, who 
had already had some years' experience in the cus- 
toms departments of Cuba and the Philippines, pro- 
ceeded to Persia in the spring of last year, and with 
his assistants struggled against all sorts of vexatious 
and largely unforeseen obstacles until the combined 
opposition of the two European powers chiefly inter- 
ested in keeping Persia bankrupt and feeble com- 
pelled him to relinquish his hopeless task and return 
home. Eight months of intelligent and courageous 
striving against overpowering odds are to be placed 
to his credit, and his highly readable and apparently 
full and frank account of his peculiar experiences 
amid the jealousies and intrigues and multitudinous 
knaveries of an oriental capital shows him to be 
skilled in writing as well as in finance. In the story 
he has to tell, Russia is of course the double-dyed 
villain; England is the guilty accomplice, weak- 
kneed and thoroughly unheroic in every situation 
depicted; and the liberty -loving constitutional party 
in Persia is the foully-wronged heroine calling in 
helpless agony for some hero to rush to her rescue. 
Five years of creditable effort at self-government 
preceded the tragic end; but, as the author says, 
"five years is nothing in the life of a nation; it is 
not even long as a period for individual reform; yet, 
after a bare five years of effort, during which the 
Persian people, with all their difficulties and har- 
assed by the so-called friendly powers, succeeded in 
thwarting a despot's well-planned effort to wrest 
from them their hard-earned liberties, the world is 
told by two European nations that these men were 
unfit, degenerate, and incapable of producing a stable 
and orderly form of government. With a knowl- 
edge of the facts of Persia's downfall, the scales 
drop from the eyes of the most incredulous, and it 
becomes clear that she was the helpless victim of 
the wretched game of cards which a few European 
powers, with the skill of centuries of practice, still 
play with weaker nations as the stake, and the lives, 
honor, and progress of whole races as the forfeit." 
Mr. Shuster prefaces his narrative with such brief 
outline of recent Persian history as its better under- 
standing requires, and appends various documents 
and other matter of a pertinent and interesting 
nature. Illustrations from photographs are lavishly 
supplied. To most readers the book will be an eye- 
opener, and it is hardly possible that its disclosures 
will not contribute in some measure to the right- 
ing of the grievous wrongs it so admirably, because 
tersely and without sensationalism, and with here 
and there a touch of grim humor, describes. 



Two books on 
a little-read 
author. 



Thomas Love Peacock has a certain 
claim to immortality since his poems 
have been published among the cheap 
classics of the "Muses Library," and two of his 
novels in "Everyman's Library"; but perhaps his 
especial glory is that reflected from his contribution 
to Shelley's biography and to his being pilloried 
in the latter's amusing letter to Harriet, after the 
poet had run off with Mary Godwin, as " expensive, 
inconsiderate, and cold." Very few to-day read 
Peacock's novels, and whoever went through his 
long poem "Rhododaphne "? It is accordingly 
rather remarkable that two considerable books on 
his life and work should appear independently of 
each other at the same time, one entitled " The Life 
of Thomas Love Peacock " by Mr. Carl van Doren 
(Button), the other "Thomas Love Peacock : A Crit- 
ical Study " by Mr. A. Martin Freeman (Kennerley). 
As their titles indicate, the former is more especially 
a biography, the latter a literary appreciation. The 
former is much fuller in biographical detail, is more 
specific and more complete in its references to au- 
thorities, and it has a good bibliography; the latter is 
more concerned with Peacock's literary development 
through the phases of pseudo-classicism, satire, and 
romanticism, and shows less familiarity with the crit- 
ical work of his predecessors. The divergencies in 
matters of fact are comparatively slight. Both 
authors agree in regarding the two leading female 
characters of " Nightmare Abbey " as Shelley's two 
wives, and not, as a writer in the " Modern Lan- 
guage Notes" (vol. xxv.) argues, as Harriet and 
Miss Kitchener. Characteristically, Mr. Freeman 
apparently does not know of this argument; but his 
case in support of his interpretation is made more 
convincing than is Mr. van Doren's for the same 
conclusion. The man Peacock stands out more 
prominently in Mr. van Doren's " Life," and an 
exceedingly interesting character he is. "Two 
neighbours were rowing by the house one evening, 
and . . . one of them, not quite sure of their local- 
ity, asked the other in a tone of voice which should 
have been modified, 'Is this old Peacock's?' Before 
his companion could reply, a strong voice called 
from the garden, ' Yes, this is old Peacock's, and this 
is old Peacock,' and 'old Peacock' stepped irately 
out of the shadow." Mr. Freeman, on the other 
hand, gives an excellent analysis of the significance 
in English literature of Peacock's novels. "'Head- 
long Hall,' as it marked the author's final stage 
from bondage to liberty, proclaimed at the same 
time the appearance of something absolutely new in 
English literature. ... In style and manner, in the 
more restricted sense of the words, he still belongs 
to the eighteenth century, Fielding being his most 
obvious influence, especially noticeable in his careful 
and lucid accounts of unheroic events, in the epic 
style. . . . He belongs, in style and language, to a 
school; but he borrows from no master. He lived 
intellectually, and, it is not too much to say, emotion- 
ally in ancient Greece and Rome and in England 
of the 'classical' period."

fond of Italy, yet not disloyal to her Slavic antece- 
dents, Miss Yoi Pawlowska records, in " A Year of 
Strangers" (Duffield), some of the experiences and 
especially some of the friendships, that made memor- 
able a twelve months' wandering and sojourning in 
Italy, Flanders, Russia, and Persia. She seems to 
be one of those "tramp-souls," as she calls them, that 
" have no home but the land which they never reach," 
although elsewhere she takes pleasure in regarding 
Rome as her abiding-place. Even the fatigues of 
travel in Persia, with its primitive modes of convey- 
ance and its still ruder hostelries, do but add zest to 
her adventures. Heat, cold, thirst, starvation, she 
says, fight with the body, but they are not enemies 
to the soul the spirit is free. One admires her 
stout heart and feels the warm human quality of the 
woman behind her gracefully-written chapters. Sor- 
row and suffering have been her schoolmasters, it 
appears, and have taught the lessons no others can 
teach. "Fate has taken from me everything," she 
writes, but with some manifest exaggeration, "every- 
thing that a human being can lose, and I can still say, 
' Joy is mine,' because I see the mountains around 
us are blue, . . ." The " strangers " with whom she 
makes acquaintance in her year of wandering, and 
with whom her pages make us acquainted, are of 
humble station and unbereft of charm and piquancy 
by any smoothing-out process of civilization. In fact, 
one of her chosen characters is a dog, and for the 
patient camels of the desert she cherishes a warm 
affection. Admirably executed are her brief impres- 
sionist sketches of all these personalities, and animal- 
ities, that appeal to her love of the distinctive, the 
picturesque, the unconventional. Entertaining, too, 
in a different way, are some of her passing reflec- 
tions. The unsettled and precarious condition of the 
Persian government strikes her as natural and salu- 
tary ; for " governments, if allowed to keep in power 
too long, begin to take themselves seriously, to the 
detriment of the people. How wise the nations are 
who change them continually. How wise the Per- 
sians are ! " By this token, then, the Latin Americans 
must be among the very wisest of the world's nations. 
The author's perfect command of English may be 
attributed to residence in England, which is referred 
to in her book. Her tasteful volume is a little mas- 
terpiece, in its way. 



Sources of 
religious 
insight and 
inspiration. 



The Bross Lectures delivered every 
ten years at Lake Forest University, 
and which have to deal with aspects 
of the philosophy and evidences of the Christian 
religion, were given last year by Professor Josiah 
Royce of Harvard, and they are now published 
under the title "The Sources of Religious Insight" 
(Scribner). By insight, Professor Royce means 
"knowledge that makes us aware of the unity of 
many facts in one whole, and that at the same time 
brings us into intimate personal contact with these 



facts and with the whole wherein they are united." 
By religion he means recognition of and reaction 
toward the fact that man needs to be saved. By 
salvation, however, the author does not mean escape 
from total depravity, but simply the gaining by man 
of "some end or aim of human life which is more 
important than all other aims, so that, by comparison 
with this aim all else is secondary and subsidiary, or 
even vain and empty." As exploited in the pages 
of this book, this aim of life is loyalty to the uni- 
verse as the universe is conceived by the philosophy 
of idealism. Professor Royce criticizes pragmatism 
at some length. While he acknowledges that all 
truth must "work," or make some difference to our 
conduct, as the pragmatists assert, and that there are 
no pure operations of the intellect divorced from 
reference to action by the thinker, he claims that all 
these truths which do work do so in virtue of their 
agreement with a realm which is superhuman, above 
the level of individual caprice, the life, in short, 
of the world. And "unless this life is more than 
merely human in its rational wealth of concrete 
meaning, we mortals have no meaning whatever." 
The problem of religion, then, is to come into the 
richest relations with this life of the whole. The 
path to such connection the author finds in the con- 
ception of loyalty. For loyalty is the one virtue which 
implies making the very best of one's own powers, 
seeking all the self-perfection one can accomplish, 
and then using all one's perfected self in the service 
of a power which is vast enough to claim the free 
allegiance of the whole soul. But temporal loyalties 
may conflict ; and so the further principle is deduced 
of loyalty to the cause of loyalty. Here, says Mr. 
Royce, is a principle fit to be made the basis of a 
universal moral code. For through every special 
cause which claims the loyalty of the individual, his 
true cause comes to light as "the spiritual unity of 
all the world of reasonable beings." While, of 
course, much of the work is conditioned by the au- 
thor's philosophy which is by no means universally 
accepted the concrete character of much of it, and 
the spiritual fervor of nearly all of it, will commend 
it as a source of spiritual inspiration even to those 
who do not agree with its intellectual premises. 
Especially is this true of his chapter on Sorrow as 
a means of religious insight. 

The meaning Since Aristotle's " Poetics." defining 
and mystery poetry has been one of the pastimes 
of poetry. of the ages. Those who have written 

on the essence of poetry fall into three groups: 
valorous critics who think they have at last captured 
the volatile spirit of poetry ; critics who utter what 
in them lies, without insisting that they have solved 
the mystery; and, finally, critics who begin by 
maintaining that poetry can never be satisfactorily 
defined. Professor Arthur Fairchild, in his "The 
Making of Poetry" (Putnam), clearly belongs to 
the last of these three groups. Setting aside the 
attempt to define poetry, on the ground that poetry 
"begins and ends in feeling" and that the nature

THE DIAL

of feeling forbids definition, Mr. Fairchild proceeds 
to analyze the material and the processes of poetry. 
The material, he finds, is "the mental image." Of 
the processes, the first is "personalising," a self- 
projection which puts the poet, as it were, into the 
things and persons that environ him, this self- 
projection being manifested by the images he uses. 
The second process is the combining of these im- 
ages. The third process is versifying, which, in the 
last analysis, has an "enforcing effect upon the 
groupings of images." The three chapters devoted to 
these processes are the longest and most important 
in the book. They are followed by " The Nature of 
Poetry," which does not improve upon what has 
been said on the theme; "The Need and Value of 
Poetry," poetry being "a biological necessity," or, 
as Professor Mackail would put it, "a function of 
life," and having its value mainly in the fact that it 
contributes "to the continuity and unity of con- 
sciousness"; and lastly, "Some Forms of Poetry 
Examined," an indirect repetition of all that has 
preceded. From the foregoing bald summary one 
may at least discern Mr. Fairchild's method that 
of the abstract system. The strength of the method 
lies in its strict logic and clear outlines. The 
author has evolved a system that is undeniably self- 
consistent and everywhere luminous ; in particular, 
the chapter on "personalising" and the chapter on 
versifying are admirably done. The weakness of the 
abstract system, when applied to poetry, lies in its 
antipathy to the spiritual qualities of high poesy. 
In his preface the author trusts that he may make 
us see more clearly the "morning radiance" that a 
good poem casts over life ; but too often, in the 
pages that follow, the morning radiance resembles 
the hard blue flame of the bunsen-burner. Poetry 
in a test-tube proves to be "a biological necessity" 
rather than "the breath and finer spirit of all 
knowledge." We watch the "raw material," the 
mental image, subjected to various processes until 
it is poured out upon a sheet of paper in the form 
of a genuine poem, Hence the formula, x +y + z 
= poem. That .the formula is correct is a fact that 
does not, somehow, enable us to read poetry with 
the "joyous yet discriminating " attitude which our 
author holds to be proper. The value of the book, 
indeed, resides, not in the lucid exposition of the 
mysteries of poetry, but in the thoughtful frame of 
mind that it induces in the reader. Too rarely do 
we think about poetry. 

In the preface to his book entitled 
" The Anarchists" (Lane), Mr. 
Ernest Alfred Vizetelly claims the 
unique merit of supplying "a history of their doings 
from the days of Baktinin." The history of a move- 
ment cannot well be written until the movement is 
past, and well past. This, Mr. Vizetelly argues, is 
clearly the case with Anarchism, or at any rate with 
that militant anarchism which pushed what was 
called "the Propaganda by Deed," and which was 
responsible for the deaths of Carnot and McKinley, 



King Humbert and the Empress Elizabeth, the last 
of which outrages occurred more than a decade ago. 
The assassination of the King of Portugal and his son 
was not due to Anarchists, the author is sure, but to 
Republicans. The long struggle between Socialism 
and Anarchism for the favor of the dissatisfied lower 
strata of society has already resulted decisively in 
favor of the former, and the world is to be saved 
not by abolishing government but by repressing the 
individual. The sub-title announces the author's in- 
tention of dealing both with the Anarchists' faith and 
with their record. The former is treated in a lumi- 
nous Introduction of twenty pages. The remainder 
of the book is a painstaking chronological account, 
carefully indexed, of all important and many unim- 
portant Anarchist manifestations, from the begin- 
nings of Bakiinin, who by a lifetime campaign in 
favor of violence earned the title of "the Father of 
Modern Anarchism." Everything is done with edi- 
fying detail : if the student wishes to know how much 
Meunier paid for rum at M. Vdry's restaurant in 
the Boulevard Magenta, or what Czolgosz had for 
breakfast on the day he paid the penalty for assas- 
sinating McKinley, this book has the information 
ready. There is, in fact, so much of detail and so 
little of generalization that it might be better to 
ignore the author's own classification and place it 
among the reference books, although there are 
pages which are breathlessly, if unpleasantly, inter- 
esting. Mr. Vizetelly, a great traveller with con- 
nections all over Europe, actually witnessed the 
killing of Carnot, as well as a number of the other 
incidents mentioned; and being, moreover, a man 
of catholic interests and unusual powers of observa- 
tion and retention, he furnishes an amazing amount 
of evidently first-hand information on the most vari- 
ous subjects related to his main theme. Anarchism 
might have found a more sympathetic historian, but 
scarcely a better informed one. 

A sheaf of The second volume of Mrs. William 

William Sharp's Sharp's uniform edition of her hus- 
uterarv papers. band ' s "Selected Writings" (Duf- 
field) bears the title " Studies and Appreciations," 
and is made up of nine critical essays on the son- 
net, on Shakespeare's sonnets, on great odes, Sainte- 
Beuve, some plays of Signor d'Annunzio, certain 
contemporary Italian poets, the modern troubadours, 
Brittany's heroic and legendary literature, and " la

There is also a fragmentary outline sketch of a pro-

thirtieth to his forty-seventh year (1885 to 1902), 
and therefore may be said to represent the best of 
his scholarly and critical work, work which suffered 
some interruption from the intrusion, in 1894, of 
that secondary personality now known as " Fiona 
Macleod," and which was cut short by the author's 
death in 1905, in his fiftieth year. The scholarship, 
appreciation, and taste shown in these attractively

the French 
Revolution. 



presented literary studies have probably won him 
more readers than have his romances, exquisite 
"prose poems" though these products of his other 
self are acknowledged to be. The spirit of his criti- 
cism is well indicated in a few words of his own, 
prefixed to the present volume : " When I speak of 
Criticism I have in mind not merely the more or less 
deft use of commentary or indication, but one of the 
several ways of literature, and in itself a rare and 
fine art : the marriage of science that knows and of 
spirit that discerns. The basis of Criticism is imag- 
ination, its spiritual quality is simplicity, its intellec- 
tual distinction is balance." In turning his pages 
one cannot but note his partiality to the more melo- 
dious or sensuous element in poetry, and his conse- 
quent fondness for Rossetti and Swinburne, the 
latter of whom he praises for his " magnificence of 
music and splendour of imagery." One might per- 
haps pardonably comment in passing on certain occa- 
sional mannerisms of Sharp's ; for instance, his use 
of the cumbrous circumlocutions " anterior to " and 
"posterior to," when he simply means "before" 
and "after," lacks the quality of " simplicity "which 
he himself so highly commends. The book supplies 
a need in gathering together in suitable form these 
excellent critical essays. 

" The Last Episode of the French 
Revolution " (Small, Maynard & Co.) 
is the somewhat questionable title 
which Mr. Ernest Belford Bax gives to his history 
of " Gracchus " Babeuf and the " Conspiracy of the 
Equals "; an ungrateful subject even for a radical 
writer, because the socialistic schemes of Babeuf were 
crude and his personality uninteresting. Mr. Bax 
undertook the task to carry out a wish expressed by 
the late William Morris that there might be in En- 
glish a reliable biography of Babeuf and a statement 
of his theories. Babeuf 's sole claim to distinction is 
as a precursor of the nineteenth-century socialists of 
the Blanquist type. Like some of the militant syndi- 
calists of the present day, he proposed to seize power 
and transform society by one great act of revolu- 
tionary violence, accompanied by a holocaust of the 
minions of the existing order. The Directory and 
the two Councils were to be " immediately judged 
by the people," and any official, high or low, who 
attempted any action whatever, should be slain, as 
well as foreigners found in the streets. Mr. Bax 
transcribes this from the "Act of Insurrection," but 
finds the informer Grisel's description of Babeuf as 
a " blood-thirsty tiger " unjustifiable ; as perhaps it 
was, for Babeuf seems to have been suffering from 
lack of imagination rather that from natural ferocity. 
Mr. Bax, however, takes a critical attitude toward 
his hero's notions of social reorganization, "as if," 
he says, " society could be voluntarily built up over- 
night, based on abstract concepts, and finished off 
in its details by the artistic sense of a few capable 
leaders." The conclusions of this book are based 
especially upon the journals and pronunciamentos of 
Babeuf and the narrative of Buonarroti, a fellow- 



conspirator. In the study of contemporary public 
opinion, Mr. Bax might well have used Professor 
Aulard's excerpts from the reports of the secret 
police, which would have guarded him against ac- 
cepting Babeuf's estimate of the strength of his 
following. The conspiracy seems to have collapsed 
amid public indifference. 

Old Testament That the Old Testament possesses 
resemblances in many characteristics in common with 
other literatures. other anc i ent or i en tal literature is 
clearly evident to any reader of Mr. R. W. Rogers's 
" Cuneiform Parallels to the Old Testament " (Eaton 
& Mains). The wide range of its mythological, 
literary, and historical material is paralleled in a 
marvellous manner by some of the choicest bits of 
ancient Sumerian, Assyrian, and Babylonian liter- 
ature. The creation of man and animals, the clash 
of good and evil, the stories of the deluge, have 
their counterpart in the mythology of the early 
inhabitants of Babylonia. Some of the far-famed 
mythologies of Greece and Rome are tame and com- 
monplace by the side of the Babylonian myths of 
Adapa, of Gilgamesh, of Ishtar's descent into Hades, 
and of Nergal and Ereshkigal. The hymns and 
prayers of those old Mesopotamean worthies and 
monarchs rank high in comparison with the psalms 
and wisdom elements of the Old Testament. They 
addressed the numerous deities of their pantheon, 
and have embodied in their prayers the chief attri- 
butes and powers of each deity. The chronological 
material supplied in the Babylonian and Assyrian 
lists is among the most useful in fixing some of the 
hitherto aggravating chronology of the Old Testa- 
ment. But the real wealth of the cuneiform literature 
for the Old Testament is found in the numerous his- 
torical texts reaching from Hammurabi of the first 
dynasty of Babylon, about 2000 B. c., down to Cyrus, 
538s. c. a period of nearly 1500 years. Of nearly 
all the translations, done anew in this volume, we 
have the transliterations in footnotes, and full refer- 
ences, to other treatments of the same text. Forty- 
eight half-tone plates and a map decorate and vivify 
the text, and help make this an indispensable new 
tool for students of the Old Testament. 



Rambling letters from a wayfarer 
^^ "Scented Isles and Coral Gar- 
dens," of Torres Straits, German 
NewGuinea, and the Dutch East Indies, are combined 
by Mr. C. D. Mackellar with accounts of travel along 
the Great Barrier Reef of Australia, and sojourns in 
Singapore, Macao, Hong-Kong, Canton, Shanghai, 
and Yokahoma. It is the traveller's Orient, with its 
more or less familiar stories, gathered afloat and 
ashore, which is here revealed. The picture of life 
aboard a coasting steamer flying the German flag is 
a more intimate account, as is also the portrayal of 
Conditions in German New Guinea in 1900, when the 
colonies were making their first considerable inroads 
upon the jungle and its head-hunters. The author 
is evidently a keenly observant traveller, quick to

detect the whims and foibles of his fellow tourists, to 
criticize the political and industrial policy of Great 
Britain or, rather, of the English, for the writer 
never forgets that he is a Scot, to commend German 
enterprise, and to pass his casual comment upon the 
industrial, commercial, social, and political condi- 
tions and prospects of the communities and races 
with whom he came in contact. A considerable 
amount of guide-book information finds its way into 
the book, but this is everywhere enlivened by the 
colloquial style, or by anecdote, verse, or jest, so 
that the reader is loth to leave the tale. The illus- 
trations are abundant, and, barring the crudely 
colored plates, well executed ; but the type face and 
often over-crowded lines detract from the reader's 
pleasure in the use of the book. (Dutton.) 

No insects exhibit more beautiful col- 
moSoii" ors and color patterns than the moths, 

especially the large night-flying ones ; 
and few animals offer so entrancing a field for the 
amateur naturalist to pry into the secrets of nature 
and not only to bring to light worlds of hidden and 
unsuspected beauty but also to add to the sum of 
human knowledge. Mrs. Gene Stratton-Porter, in 
her "Moths of the Limberlost" (Doubleday), has 
rendered both services for these too little-known but 
very interesting creatures. No one can read her full 
accounts of her experiences with them, in egg, cat- 
erpillar, pupa, and full-blown moth stages, without 
catching her enthusiasm and straightway wishing for 
a swamp equalling the Limberlost in its treasures. 
The illustrations are abundant, though some of the 
plates of scenery are scarcely germane to the work. 
The coloration in most of the reproductions of the 
moths and caterpillars is excellent, although in 
some instances a certain haziness, due to technique, 
obscures details. Some crudities should have been 
eliminated in editing, as, for example, the use of 
"organism" for organ, of "close "for close to, as 
well as certain grammatical inaccuracies. The au- 
thor exhibits a fine scorn for the scientist and his 
shortcomings, and holds a brief for the nature-lover. 
Her observations are scientifically valuable, however, 
her narrative is entertaining, her enthusiasm catch- 
ing, and her revelations so stimulating that one 
readily forgives some minor defects in bookmaking. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

Professor James W. Garner's " Government in the 
United States, National, State, and Local " (American 
Book Co.) is a high-school text book of the typical sort. 
It emphasizes the actual workings of government, and 
in its " research questions " puts a good many subjects 
for discussion and argument up to the student. 

Before one begins a serious and systematic study of 
social science he may be helped on his way by a concise 
sketch which will indicate the general direction he must 
take and the value of the study in relation to his own 
activities and interests. But such a sketch is by no 
means a substitute for scientific investigation of the 



fundamental principles of economics, sociology, and law. 
The experience of Mr. William M. Balch, author of 
"Christianity and the Labor Movement" (Sherman, 
French & Co.), has enabled him to interpret the subject 
to religious persons who have not studied it in a sys- 
tematic way, and he has done his work in a clear and 
forcible style. 

" Modern Drama and Opera " is a reference reading 
list piiblished by the Boston Book Co., and prepared by 
Mrs. Clara Norton, Mr. Frank K. Walter, and Miss 
Fanny Elsie Marquand. Texts and critical reviews are 
listed upon the following authors: D'Annunzio, Haupt- 
mann, Ibsen, Jones, Maeterlinck, Phillips, Pinero, Ros- 
tand, Shaw, Sudermann, Debussy, Puccini, and Richard 
Strauss. 

In a volume styled "The Poet's Song of Poets" 
(Badger), Mrs. Anna Sheldon Camp Sneath does once 
more what has been done several times already 
collects into an anthology the best-known pieces "in 
which the poets express their appreciation and estimate 
of their fellow poets." The subjects of these estimates 
range through English literature from Chaucer to 
Browning. 

The sixteenth chapter of Dr. C. Alphonso Smith's 
Amerikanische Literatur (already fully reviewed in these 
columns) is perhaps the most interesting in the entire 
book. It is a luminous discussion of the structure, 
philosophy, and history of the American short story. 
A translation of this chapter into English has been pub- 
lished separately by Messrs. Ginn & Co., and should 
find a welcome both with general readers and in the 
college classroom. 

Andrew Lang's last book, the history of English lit- 
erature announced a few days before his death, was for- 
tunately finished before the pen fell from his hand, and 
proves to be a volume of 700 pages (Longmans), 
written with the author's characteristic lightness of 
touch and easy command of his theme, but also with 
those occasional slight misstatements and questionable 
judgments which could hardly fail to appear in the 
pages of so rapid and prolific a writer. His assertion 
that Emerson is now a dead factor in American litera- 
ture will evoke quick contradiction from not a few of 
his readers; and his passing misquotation from Long- 
fellow's " Psalm of Life " will be noted, with other slips 
of a similar sort, as justifying the " Athenaeum " in its 
recent reference to the demon of inaccuracy that so 
often sat at his side. But any Dryasdust can give us 
accuracy of detail ; only here and there a writer can 
charm us into indifference toward such small matters. 

Miss Jennette E. C. Lincoln's researches in the open- 
air revels and games of Old England, and the application 
of the results of her researches to her work as instructor 
in physical culture, have well prepared her for the pro- 
duction of "The Festival Book, May- Day Pastimes, 
and the May Pole " (A. S. Barnes Co.), which will be 
found exceedingly helpful by all who are trying to 
make the out-door life of the young healthful and beau- 
tiful. The brief introductory chapter gives enough of a 
historical setting to stimulate interest in this form of 
pastime; and to the materials derived from England in 
its pleasure-loving days have been added accounts of 
some folk dances from Sweden, Scotland, and elsewhere. 
By means of illustrations, diagrams, music, and minute 
instructions as to costumes, etc., the beauties and plea- 
sures of the open-air pageant and festival are brought 
within the possibilities of all.

NOTES. 



A study of "Modern Italian Literature," by Mr. 
Lacy Collison-Morley, appears on Messrs. Little, Brown, 
& Co.'s autumn list. 

New volumes of essays by Samuel McChord Crothers, 
Bliss Perry, Agnes Repplier, John Burroughs, and 
Meredith Nicholson are an attractive feature of Hough- 
ton Mifflin Co.'s autumn list. 

Mr. Charles H. Caffin, author of " How to Study Pic- 
tures," etc., has been abroad gathering material for his 
book on " The Story of British Painting," which will be 
one of the Century Co.'s fall issues. 

Yoshio Markino, the author of " A Japanese Artist 
in London," is writing another volume, " When I Was 
a Child," which describes his youth in his native coun- 
try and dwells on the training and education of Jap- 
anese children. 

Two literary biographies of exceptional interest, to 
be issued shortly by Houghton Mifflin Co., are " The 
Three Brontes," by Miss May Sinclair; and the Life 
and Letters of John Bickman, friend of Charles Lamb, 
by Mr. Orlo Williams. 

Mr. Clayton Sedgwick Cooper has put the fruit of 
much travel among educational institutions, both in this 
country and abroad, and of study of college conditions, 
into a book entitled " Why Go to College," which the 
Century Co. will issue during the fall. 

" London Lavender " is the title of a new novel by 
Mr. E. V. Lucas, which the Macmillan Co. will publish 
during the autumn. The same house also announces 
another of Mr. Lucas's well-known " Wanderer " books 
this time " A Wanderer in Florence." 

A pocket edition of the romances of The'ophile 
Gautier, as translated and edited by Professor F. C. de 
Sumichrast, will be published in ten volumes by Messrs. 
Little, Brown, & Co. Uniform with this set will appear 
Gautier's books of travel, in seven volumes. 

A volume of hitherto unpublished letters by Ulysses 
S. Grant will be issued during the autumn by Messrs. 
G. P. Putnam's Sons. They were written by Grant to 
his father and his youngest sister during the months 
preceding the Civil War and during the years of cam- 
paigning. 

A new novel by Gerhardt Hauptmann, entitled 
" Atlantis," is announced for early publication by Mr. 
B. W. Huebsch. At the same time there will be issued 
by the same publisher Volume I. of an authorized 
complete edition of Hauptmann's plays, edited by Mr. 
Ludwig Lewisohn. 

To his excellent series of critical studies of modern 
authors, Mr. Mitchell Kennerley will add five new vol- 
umes during the next few months, the subjects and au- 
thors being as follows: Thomas Hardy, by Lascelles 
Abercrombie; Walter Pater, by Edward Thomas; Wil- 
liam Morris, by John Drinkwater; A. C. Swinburne, 
by Edward Thomas; George Gissing, by Frank Swin- 
nerton. 

A record of American publishing that should rival in 
interest Mr. J. Henry Harper's account of " The House 
of Harper " is announced for autumn issue in " A 
Memoir of George Palmer Putnam; together with a 
Record of the Earlier Years of the Publishing House 
Founded by Him." The author of the work is Mr. 
George Haven Putnam, the present head of the house 
of Putnam. 



A gift-book possessing something more than transient 
value and interest is " The Modern Reader's Chaucer," 
which the Macmillan Co. has in active preparation. The 
volume will comprise Chaucer's complete poetical works, 
newly rendered into modern English by Messrs. John 
S. P. Tatlock and Percy MacKaye. A series of thirty- 
two full-page illustrations in color will be contributed 
by Mr. Warwick Goble. 

"My Friends at Brook Farm," an illustrated volume 
of memories by Mr. John Van Der Zee Sears, will be 
issued this month by Desmond FitzGerald, Inc. The 
author, one of the few survivors of the Brook Farm 
Association, gives his personal recollections of his asso- 
ciates in this movement, including such celebrities as 
Emerson, Hawthorne, Horace Greeley, Margaret Fuller, 
George Ripley, Charles A. Dana, and many others. 

What will undoubtedly prove " the book of the sea- 
son" is announced by Messrs. Seribner in "The Letters 
of George Meredith," edited by his son. These letters 
extend over some fifty years, beginning except for a 
few scattered notes from his boyhood about 1858, 
when Meredith was thirty years old, and after his first 
marriage. Among his correspondents are included his 
life-long friends, John Morley and Admiral Maxse, 
besides Frederick Greenwood, Chapman the publisher, 
Leslie Stephen, Robert Louis Stevenson, Trevelyan, and 
many others, besides a group of family friends and some 
of the members of his own household.

Many unsuccessful manuscripts sim- 
ply need expert revision to make 
them immediately available. But 
~~~~~^~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~ mere publication doesn't necessarily 
imply either literary success or large sales. Judicious editing will not 
only secure acceptance for many manuscripts hitherto unavailable, but 
it will obtain for them such measure of literary and financial success 
as their possibilities deserve. This I can give, securing results that 
count. Such firms as Appleton, Putnams, Lippincott, etc., publish my 
own books. Why not have some leading house or magazine publish your 
writings ? Address: EDITOR, Box 4L, 435 W. 119th St., New York City.

$1.50 net; postage extra. 

Main Currents of 


By AUGUST STRINDBERG 

Translated from the Swedish by 
EDWIN BJO'RKMAN. 
Miss Julia is more often acted on the 
German and Scandinavian stage than 
any other Strindberg play. Strindberg's 
preface to it, a sort of dramatic creed, 
given here for the first time in English, is 
almost as famous abroad as the play. 
The Stronger. CHARACTERS : Mrs. X 
and Miss Y, actresses. SCENE : A room 
in a ladies' restaurant. 
YOU could read this in eighteen minutes 
and you would comprehend the life stories 
of three people. The play has almost no 
action in the ordinary sense, but has the 
effect of fierce, continuous action it 
makes a mental conflict as vivid as if a 
physical conflict.

Poetical Works of 
George Meredith 

With Some Notes by G. M. TREVELYAN 

George Meredith was one of the great 
poets in the succession of English 
poetic masters. It is therefore right 
that all of his poetry should be made 
available in one volume by which his 
eminence can be appreciated and 
judged. Founded on the carefully 
revised text of the Memorial Edition 
(in which the poetry fills three large 
volumes), this is an impressive volume 
containing more than 600 pages. 

With portrait. $2.00 net- postage extra. 



The Mortal Gods 
and Other Dramas 



By OLIVE TILFORD D ARC AN 

A new book of poetic dramas by 
Mrs. Dargan whose previous volumes, 
" Lords and Lovers and Other Dra- 
mas" and " Semiramis," have given 
her not only a position in the first rank 
of American poets, but a position pecu- 
liarly her own. " A Son of Hermes " 
is a drama of the time of Alcibiades, 
" The Sword of Love," one of the Cru- 
sades in the 12th century, and "The 
Mortal Gods" deals with current social 
philosophy in an imaginary country.

breadth of sympathy, and the absolute 
command of a style that can express the 
subtlest distinctions or enforce the broad- 
est principles. This eminence as thinker 
and writer is reaffirmed in the essays of 
this volume, " Gateways to Literature,"

ary History,'' " In Behalf of the General 
Reader," "The Duty of Imitation," 
" The Devil's Advocate," etc.

that therein Mr. Galsworthy sets forth, 
sometimes by means of his literary and 
artistic beliefs, his ideas of what art is 
and of what a novelist and dramatist and

in historic Hoosac in its true relation to the world's great history. A mass of legendary material hitherto uncollected, 
together with profuse illustrations of Revolutionary heroes and historic fields, combine to make the volume valuable 
and attractive, not only to the residents of the Hoosac and Wallomsac country, but to all students of American history 



Thy Rod and Thy Staff 

By ARTHUR CHRISTOPHER BENSON 

Author of " The College Window." f 1.50 net ; by mail, $1.65. 
" Once more Mr. Benson has put forth one of his appealing

has succeeded, with unfailing certainty of touch, in getting 
out of his study a remarkable and impressive effect." 

In the last of his books, which dealt with personal experi- 
ences, " The Silent Isle," the author promised the reader 
that he would some day tell how it was that the pleasant 
design that he had set for himself failed. The present book 
is the fulfilment of that promise.

SEPTEMBER PUBLICATIONS 

Charge It By IRVING BACHELLER, Author of " Keeping Up With Lizzie," " Eben Holden," etc. 

" Charge It " will figure as one of the largest items of credit in the ledger of Mr. Bacheller's reputation. It is a 
genial, merry satire full of the keen wit of the Honorable Socrates Potter. 

Like " Keeping Up With Lizzie " it is a much needed and inspiring book. It will make the world happier and wiser. 
Its seventeen chapters are so many waves of merriment and every wave breaks into laughter wholesome hearty 
laughter. It is the laughter of conviction and that is the best kind. 

"Charge It" hits most of the glaring follies of to-day and hits them hard, but in a kindly spirit. New 
thought, swamp fiction, battle-axe aristocracy, idleness, and the love of display receive the attention of Mr. Potter 
the genial lawyer of Pointview. Like Lizzie it will have an effect on the life of the time, and there is no better 
word that can be said of any book. Illustrated. l%mo. Cloth, $1.00 net. 

Paill Rundel By WILL N. HARBEN, Author of "Dixie Hart," "Abner Daniel," "Jane Dawson," 
" M'am Linda," etc. 

This new story of Southern life stirs all the deepest emotions of the human heart. Its scene is in one of those 
Georgia villages that Mr. Harben knows so well and depicts with so much charm of homely realism. In connection 
with a thrilling plot, involving the clash of violently opposing natures, he develops a sympathetic drama of the soul. 
The story revolves about Paul Rundel, the son of a semi-invalid father and a vain, pleasure-loving mother who 
shamelessly accepts the attentions of another man. The action is swift and spirited as Paul, driven to desperation 
by the slanderous remarks about his mother, attempts to murder her lover and then flees the country. Paul's sub- 
sequent return, his struggle upward toward higher ideals, his unflinching courage in the face of peril, and the

MARK TWAIN-A Biography 

The Personal and Literary Life of Samuel Langhorne Clemens 

By ALBERT BIGELOW PAINE 

More fascinating than fiction, this true story of a strange and unfixed life is like no other biography the 
world has known. It is as full of fun and humor and rollicking anecdote as the writings of Mark Twain 
himself, and as diversified for this Great Author and Philosopher was ever the plaything of a whimsical 
Fate that mingled tragedy and adventure and laughter and failure and success in swift following sequence. 

The very preparation for the writing of the work was a romance. Six years the author gave to the work, 
traveling half-way round the world to follow in the footsteps of his subject, to visit every haunt in 
Europe or America; and four years of the time the two he whose biography was to be written, and he 
who was to write it lived in close daily association. 

THE RESULT IS ONE OF THE GREAT BIOGRAPHIES OF ALL TIME

THE PICTURES OF POLLY 

By MARY KING COURTNEY 

Virginal and dewy-fresh, all rosy with the soft radiance of delectable youth, this story comes tripping 
with laughter a new kind, a new name. It is the fun of love, of iridescent love; the delicate tracery 
of coquetry, its text to-lean-upon-love-and-keep-your-humor-dry a story that sings itself into one's heart. 

It ought to have been written in violet ink and yet beyond its laughter and its fun, beyond the moon- 
light of its tender witchery, there glows the passionate feeling, the ardent wooing, the daring, naked and 
unshamed, which marks the dawn of palpitant first love.

Marcus Ordeyne," etc. With 24 illustrations by Alec Ball. I2mo. Cloth, $1.30 net. 
Postage, 12 cents. Ready October 4th. 

*,K* These joyous adventures form a climax to Mr. Locke'* novels of diverting Gallic experiences, with their unalloyed 
happiness and their rich-brown despairs. In "Pujol," even more than in any other story since " The Beloved Vagabond," 
there are the humorous enthusiams, the vagrant content, the unhampered participation in legitimate good things of the heart, 
that have perhaps gained for the author as strong a following of admirers as any living -writer of fiction possesses in America.

** A valuab'.e personal document. The volume contains about forty illustrations, including an original lithograph sketch, 
seven lithographs in color drawn by the author upon brown paper, and many in black and -white. The remainder are facsimiles 
by photo-lithography. In most cases the originals are drawings and sketches by Whistler -which have never been published 
before, and are closely connected with the matter of the book. The text deals with the author's memories of nearly twenty 
years' close association with Whistler and treats only with the man as an artist, and perhaps, especially as a lithographer.

master in the -writing of blank verse in the passages in -which he makes Judas explain the motives for the great betrayal.

PROF. EMIL CARL WILM. Ph.D. The Problem of Religion 

This is a thoroughly intelligible, readable discussion of an 
interesting but difficult theme. Professor Wilm possesses some 
of the best literary qualities of Professors James and Rpyce. 
He is less technical than either, almost completely avoiding 
unfamiliar terms. He states the idealist position in a way that 
is intelligible to the general reader, and shows clearly that its 
logical issue is faith in God. Cloth Price $i. 25 net; postage lOc. 

E. HERMANN 

Eucken and Bergson : Their Significance for Christian Thought 
Eucken in Germany and Bergson in France are the two most 
fascinating and potent thinkers of the day. They have pro- 
foundly influenced the course of religious and philosophical 
thinking on the Continent and in this country. The writer of 
this book has an intimate and first-hand knowledge of the work 
of both thinkers, and presents here a brilliant study of their 
ruling ideas. Price $1.CO net ; postage 10 cents. 
W. E. ORCHARD, D.D. Problems and Perplexities 

Every sort of question philosophical, theological, ethical, 
practical comes up for discussion, and Dr. Orchard shows ex- 
traordinary breadth of sympathy, insight, and knowledge in 
dealing with them. His standpoint is that of the enlightened 
Christian thinker of today ; he faces all problems courageously.

An ideal birthday or Christmas gift for a boy is this delightful 
story of ten year old Johnny Blossom, a fine, manly little fel- 
low, warm-hearted and true as steel. Of course, being a boy 
full of life and spirit, he often rushes headlong into trouble, 
and many of his experiences some ludicrous, some sad are 
related in these pages. Price $1.00 net; postage 10 cents.

humorous, religious and patriotic. Price $1 00 net ; postage lOc. 
J. BRIERLEY The Life of the Soul

the keen insight, the wealth of literary illustration that have 
become familiar in Mr. Brierley's writing. He deals with a 
wide range of topics social, religious, philosophic of pres- 
ent-day interest, but always from the inner side, bringing great 
principles to illuminate them. Price $1.25 net; postage 10 cents.

ANNOUNCEMENTS OF FALL BOOKS 202 

(A classified list of the new books planned for publi- 
cation during the coming Fall and Winter season.) 



BOOKS OF THE COMING YEAR. 

Following a custom of many years, we pub- 
lish in this issue of THE DIAL a classified list 
of the fall announcements of the chief American 
publishing houses, to serve as a guide for libra- 
rians and booksellers, and to whet the appetites 
of individual book lovers in anticipation of the 
literary feast which the coming months have in 
store for them. Likewise in accordance with 
our custom, we take this occasion to select from 
the thousands of titles offered a few of those 
that seem worthy of special mention for their 
promise of entertainment or instruction, restrict- 
ing our selection, however, to the categories of 
biography, history, general belletristic litera- 
ture, and fiction. 

It is a venturesome thing to guess at what is 
likely to prove "the book of the year," but we 
shall probably not go far wrong in naming the 
"Letters of George Meredith" for that distinc- 
tion. The collection has been edited by the son 
of the poet-novelist, and extends over a full half- 
century. Among those to whom the letters are 
addressed are Lord Morley, Leslie Stephen, 
Frederick Green wood, and Robert Louis Steven- 
son, and we may well believe that such corres- 
pondents brought out the best that Meredith 
had to give. A few examples already published 
make it clear that he by no means kept all his 
good things for his books. An important work 
of American biography will be " The Personal 
and Literary Life of Samuel Langhorne Clem- 
ens," by Mr. Albert Bigelow Paine, the literary 
executor of the great humorist. "The New 
Life of Byron," by Miss Ethel Colburn Mayne, 
promises to discuss the ugly scandal first raised 
by Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe, and revived by 
Lord Lovelace's " Astarte" in 1905. We hope 
that the author does not treat this unsavory 
matter seriously. John Bigelow's " Retrospec- 
tions of an Active Life " will be completed with 
the publication of two new volumes, making 
five in all. Miss May Sinclair's study of " The 
Three Brontes" will, we fancy, be chiefly inter- 
esting as a revelation of the writer's own tempera- 
ment. A singularly interesting and readable 
volume of reminiscences will v be Mr. James 
Kendall Hosmer's " The Last Leaf," being " ob- 
servations during seventy-five years of men and 
events in America and England." Mr. Hos- 
mer's association with the political and in tell ec-

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



tual movements of the past half -century has been 
intimate, and his memoirs cannot fail to be illumi- 
nating. The " Memoir of George Palmer Put- 
nam," by his son Mr. George Haven Putnam, will 
doubtless form a contribution to American pub- 
lishing annals of permanent value and interest. 
The department of history does not offer any 
work of forthstanding importance, but there are 
many special studies in restricted fields that 
promise to be of value. We note in particular 
the "New France and New England" of Mr. 
James Douglas, the "Italy in the Thirteenth 
Century" of Mr. Henry D. Sedgwick, and 
"The Grandeur That Was Rome" by Mr. J. 
C. Stobart. We note also that the eighth vol- 
ume of Mr. J. B. McMaster's " History of the 
People of the United States," completing the 
work as planned over thirty years ago, and 
bringing it down to the outbreak of the Civil 
War, is now ready for publication. 

The category of general literature is mainly 
remarkable for its profusion of volumes of col- 
lected essays. Dr. S. M. Crothers, Mr. Mere- 
dith Nicholson, Mr. Brander Matthews, Mr. 
John Burroughs, Miss Agnes Repplier, Mr. 
G. K. Chesterton, Mr. John Galsworthy, Mr. 
Hilaire Belloc, Mr. Frederic Harrison, Mr. 
Austin Dobson, " Vernon Lee," the late Lionel 
Johnson, and M. Maeterlinck are all to be 
represented this year. This is a list to justify 
one in saying with Mr. Squeers: "Here's 
richness ! " We shall await with much interest 
such books as Mr. Irving Babbitt's " Masters 
of Modern French Criticism," and " Some En- 
glish Story Tellers" by Mr. Frederic Tabor 
Cooper. A very attractive announcement is that 
of a series of critical studies in separate volumes 
of substantial size, of modern English writers. 
The forthcoming volumes have for their subjects 
Hardy, Pater, Swinburne, William Morris, and 
George Gissing. 

Books about the theatre and books of plays 
fill a large place among our announcements. The 
most important is " The Wallet of Time," by 
Mr. William Winter, in which our veteran dra- 
matic critic reviews the history of the American 
stage from the time of Junius Brutus Booth to 
the present day. This is likely to prove the 
crowning work of Mr. Winter's life-long devo- 
tion to whatsoever things are lovely and of good 
report in our theatrical life. " The Present 
State of the English Theatre," by Mr. George 
Calderon, is another interesting announcement. 
The new translations promised from Strindberg 
and Tchekoff will be welcome additions to the 
shelf of foreign dramatic literature. The plays 



of Hauptmann are also being prepared for pub- 
lication in English. 

In poetry, by far the most important an- 
nouncement is that of the collected works of 
William Vaughn Moody, with a biographical 
introduction by Mr. John M. Manly. Moody's 
great dramatic trilogy, of which " The Fire- 
Bringer " and " The Masque of Judgment " 
were published during his lifetime, was left un- 
finished at his untimely death, but a considerable 
fragment of the closing section had been written, 
and this, together with a number of unpublished 
poems, will be included in the new edition, which 
will also include Moody's two plays, " The Great 
Divide" and "The Faith Healer." The two 
volumes of this edition will thus contain the 
practically complete work of the most remark- 
able poet given to English literature during the 
last score or more of years. Next in importance 
to this announcement is probably that of a new 
volume of poetic dramas by Mrs. Olive Tilford 
Dargan, who is well known to the elect (although 
not to the general public) as one of the most 
remarkable poetical personalities of our day. 
The forthcoming volume will contain three plays 
in three distinct fields of imaginative interest. 
Two anthologies are promised which are likely 
to attract much attention. One is " The Golden 
Treasury of American Songs and Lyrics '' upon 
which Mr. Curtis Hidden Page has been engaged 
for several years, and which is announced under 
exactly the same title as was given to a similar 
collection by Mr. Frederic Lawrence Knowles 
some fifteen years ago. The other anthology is 
" The Lyric Year," which is to represent one 
hundred living American poets by pieces entered 
in a sort of prize competition. The outcome of 
this experiment will be well worth observing. 

The fiction list is, as usual, of appalling 
length. Miss Mary Johnston is to give us, in 
" Cease Firing," the concluding section of her 
masterly study of the military operations of 
Stonewall Jackson. A new novel by Mrs. Mary 
S. Watts is promised, to be entitled "Van 
Cleve." The late David Graham Phillips, whose 
works go on forever, is represented by "George 
Helm," one of a numerous posthumous progeny. 
" The Joyous Adventures of Aristide Pujol " 
is to be Mr. William J. Locke's vehicle of 
whimsical entertainment. Mr. Maarten Maar- 
tens's "Eve " will be a welcome offering from 
an author whom we would gladly read more fre- 
quently. In " Marriage," we presume that Mr. 
H. G. Wells is to make another of his audacious 
contributions to sociological literature. A few 
more titles that seem promising are the follow-

THE NOMAD IN LITERATURE. 



The recent publication of a biography of George 
Borrow and of his Letters to the Bible Society 
reveals the permanence of his fame and the interest 
the world takes in the Nomad in Literature. Hardly 
anybody needs a biography less. He lives in his 
own works as the victor over the Flaming Tinman, 
the unsatisfactory lover of Isopel Berners, and the 
perfectly satisfactory Bible missionary to the gypsies 
and bandits and Jews of Spain. His first literary 
work was a compilation, in six volumes, of "Cele- 
brated Criminal Trials," for which he received fifty 
pounds. His richer reward, probably, was the turn 
this work gave him for low life, picturesque adven- 
tures, and racy language. It is almost a disappoint- 
ment to learn that he settled down at forty and lived 
for forty more years as a country gentleman and au- 
thor, with no more vivid happenings in his life than 
quarrels with his neighbors and the critics. But he 
had his fling, and he endures, one of the classic 
wanderers of the world. 

The primal instinct of every healthy boy is to be 
a highwayman, a pirate, a hunter, anything which 
will take him away along the road that stretches 
before his door, over the waves that beat before his 
home. As he grows up, this instinct is crushed or 
stifled in him, and he becomes a tethered thing, a 
city dweller or a serf of the soil. In a few, the 
longing for the distant, the unknown, persists, and 
these develop into sailors, adventurers, explorers, 
tramps. Perhaps it is the nobler part to stay in one 
spot, to build up a home, to sink roots into the land, 
to become a citizen in all senses of that word. But 
to seek change and adventure and danger is certainly 
not ignoble : they who do it are the imaginative and 
poetical souls. For the things we see all the time 
we do not see at all. Revelation comes with the first 
look. It is true that familiarity breeds contempt. 
Things show most greatly by glimpses. Out of the 
haze of the unfamiliar leap appearances of beauty 
and power and strangeness that thrill the soul. The 
wanderer alone can be experienced and educated. 
His mind becomes a storehouse of inestimable treas- 
ures, a picture-gallery of impressions, a library of 
epics and dramas and lyrics which are all his own. 

What a splendid historic and literary ancestry has 
the common tramp, who skulks along the highway 
and bivouacs in the coppice beside his fire of dry 
twigs and his tin-can cooking utensil! There is 



Ulysses, whose vicissitudes and adventures go to 
form the typal song of the great open way. He, it 
is true, was not born to the trade of wandering. He 
was prudent, cautious, a getter of wealth, an accum- 
ulator of honors the Benjamin Franklin of anti- 
quity. But the anger of the heavens drives him forth, 
and he drifts over the face of the known world. What 
change, what variety, what experience! To be the 
companion of Circe's herds, to recline beside Calypso 
in her island grot, to be cast up naked on the shores 
of King Alcinoils' kingdom, and to sit at banquet 
and tell of his wars and wanderings while the most 
glorious girl in Greek literature watches him from 
a shadowed doorway and wishes like Desdemona 
that heaven had made her such a man! And then 
the long delayed home-coming, the slaughter of the 
Suitors, and Penelope's welcome. Here Homer 
leaves him; but the wiser Dante (and Tennyson in 
splendid paraphrase) looks deeper into the heart of 
the much enduring, much experienced man, and 
doubting whether he who had known danger in a 
thousand forms, to whom nearly every new sun had 
brought a new difficulty or a new joy, who had felt 
the embraces of Calypso and the maidenly regard of 
Nausicaa's eyes, doubting whether such a one 
could rest in tranquil content with a wife grown old 
and an insipidly pious son, sets him to call his 
companions about him, hoist the sail on his galley, 
and steer out into the sunset sea. 

Then there is the Wandering Jew, who certainly 
ought to be elected patron saint of the tramping 
profession. He too, like Ulysses, was pitchforked 
into the business driven forth under curse or 
doom. It would seem that the divine powers held 
homekeeping to be the normal state of man, and 
travelling a punishment. It is the tragic note, too, 
of Ahasuerus's career which has been exploited by 
every writer who has handled the theme. But 
surely he must have got a great deal of enjoyment 
out of his never-ending experiences. For one thing, 
he has had time to exhaust the possibilities of life. 
For it is the deepest thing in the true nomad's 
nature that he is avid of novel adventure. He is 
no sooner plunged into one experience than a better 
one seems to rise before him. There is a fairer 
valley on the other side of the hill, a fresh enchant- 
ment a little farther down the road. In his nine- 
teen hundred years of touring (if he is still afoot 
and faring on), the Wandering Jew can easily have 
seen all that may be seen and done all that may be 
done on this earth. There is another feature of his 
career in which he is peculiarly typical, and that is 
his loneliness. Your true nomad always, at least 
where the thing is possible, goes alone. He needs 
detachment; he needs to be eternally the stranger, 
really to know the novelty of life that rises around 
him. If he travels with companions, in companies, 
he carries his home-life with him; he is protected 
against the new and the unknown. 

But it was in the Middle Ages, the time of 
Chivalry, that the nomadic cult was the most wide- 
spread. The books that composed Don Quixote's

[Sept. 16, 



library Amadis of Gaul, Palmerin of England, 
Tirante, the White Knight, and all their companions, 
books which were the popular reading of Europe 
testify to this, as do the great romantic poems of 
Tasso and Ariosto and the epics of Charlemagne 
and Arthur. It was part of the education of a 
young knight to mount his steed and with his trusty 
sword and lance leave his home and wander far and 
wide, seeking adventures. And it was not only an 
unmapped but largely a roadless world he had to 
traverse. Through forest, over plain and mountain, 
he had to find his way a moving court of justice 
fighting wrongs, redressing grievances, encountering 
inimical giants or rival knights; glad indeed if the 
legitimate spells he bore with him were sufficient to 
overcome the might of evil enchanters and magi- 
cians. And all the while his only correspondence 
with home and the lady of his fealty was the trains 
of prisoners he sent to bow before her feet. If his 
quest were the Holy Grail, he became a still nobler 
and higher figure. The Holy Grail! That it is, 
in fact, which all the nomads of the world are in 
search of. It may mask under a score of names 
the Passage to India, the North Pole, Eldorado, 
but ever there is the idea of something worthy the 
devotion of a man's life, something whose winning 
shall be a crown to him forever. 

We may pass by those professional nomads, the 
gypsies, whose migrations thread through the ages, 
because they travel in companies and groups, and 
are therefore outside the pale of the true nomadic 
tribe. They have doubtless done the world good 
by letting a little mystery and a sense for the 
strange and remote into dull and settled communi- 
ties. And they have also done good by proving to 
the peoples of the roof-tree that fresh air is not 
exactly deadly. 

This last is the great merit of Rousseau. That 
he upset the thrones of Europe is a little matter in 
comparison with his revival of the lost art of pedes- 
trianism, his teaching mankind that nature furnishes 
better employment for nose and eyes than the per- 
fumed and decorated apartments of the grand 
siecle. He also taught his fellows the cheapness of 
the most delicious pleasures the march along the 
tree-shadowed highway or through the flower- 
adorned wood, the halt by the spring or rivulet 
to bathe his feet and eat his morsel of bread, the 
talk with peasants or the picnic with damsels simi- 
larly astray, the bivouac under the stars. It is 
asserted, falsely enough, that nature came into liter- 
ature through Rousseau. No age has been without 
its devotees of the open, and all that Rousseau 
gives, and more, is in Homer and Dante and Shake- 
speare. But he did for a time turn men's thoughts 
almost exclusively natureward. Chateaubriand and 
Goethe and Wordsworth and Byron are his pupils. 
Childe Harold would hardly have left his ances- 
tral home if it had not been for the Swiss peasant. 

The greatest of modern knights-errant are the 
explorers and discoverers. The North Pole, Africa, 
Asia, South America, the Pacific Islands, all have 



furnished their quota of redoubtable spirits lured 
forth to seek danger and difficulty, the novel and 
the unknown. It is true that these have usually had 
companions; but there is a loneliness of leadership, 
and Stanley and Burton in Africa, Nansen and 
Melville and Peary in the Arctic, are true to the 
most heroic nomad type. The mass of this litera- 
ture of exploration is great, and it would almost 
seem that to wander and adventure is the natural 
and primal instinct in man, that all settling down, 
building of homes and cities, the raising of families, 
the gathering together of material things, are repug- 
nant to the best of the spirit that is in him. 

This feeling is still more forced upon us when we 
consider the vast imaginative literature which may 
be classed as the wandering genre. Nearly all the 
great epics of the world are stories of travel and ad- 
venture. The "Ramayana," the "Mahabharata," 
the "Shah Nameh," the "Iliad," the "Odyssey," 
the "^Eneid," "Jerusalem Delivered," "Orlando," 
"Paradise Lost," and others too numerous to be 
named, are dominated by the nomad star. The 
dramas of the world are more static ; they demand a 
fixed framework and a unity of scene which are in- 
imical to the peregrinating spirit. Yet even in the 
drama there are plenty of outlets for the nomad type. 
It is rather curious that^Eschylus brings into contrast 
and contact the most permanently fixed of all tragic 
sufferers, Prometheus, and the madly-driven world- 
circling lo. CEdipus is a wanderer, both when he 
commits his crime and when he expiates it. Shake- 
speare is never happier than when he can free his 
people from the bonds of home and society, and 
set them to wandering in the fields and woods, as 
witness the "Midsummer Night's Dream," "The 
Tempest," "Cymbeline," "The Winter's Tale," and 
" As You Like It." As for novels and romances, they 
are of adventure and wandering all compact. From 
the earliest one the "Golden Ass" to the latest 
best-seller, it is scarcely too much to say that nine- 
tenths of them turn that way. Run over the names of 
the great novels of the world "Don Quixote," 
"Wilhelm Meister," "The Three Guardsmen," 
"Tom Jones," one-half of Scott, the best of Dickens, 
all are treatments of the wandering theme. If 
novels represent life, it would seem that we are a race 
of nomads. The wanderer at least is the hero of liter- 
ature, even if he is ineffectual and more or less of an 
outcast in real existence. 

Of course the centralizing and concentrating influ- 
ences of life are really the most powerful. They are 
necessities of our state ; the expansive and diverging 
forces are in comparison luxuries. In particular, 
woman is the type of home and society. Wherever 
she appears she is a centre around which a frame- 
work and a barrier are speedily erected. 

In conclusion it may be said that wide wander- 
ings are not absolutely necessary for the display of 
nomadic instinct. We may make discoveries at 
home. Each of us may be a Columbus to the con- 
tinent of Ourself .

CASUAL COMMENT. 



INCENTIVES TO LITERARY EFFORT, as to exertion 
of whatever kind, must be candidly confessed to be 
largely of an unheroic and unromantic nature. It 
is the res angusta domi that is ultimately answer- 
able for the great bulk of the world's noteworthy 
achievement. Whether churches would thrive on 
an income derived wholly from endowment, whether 
poets would sing if subsidized by the State, whether 
publishing houses would raise the standard of litera- 
ture to dizzy heights if relieved from all concern 
as to book-sales, whether magazines and newspapers 
would attain to an unimagined excellence if perma- 
nently endowed, these are questions that will prob- 
ably for all time be open to debate, with strong 
presumptions in favor of the negative. Nevertheless, 
Mr. Hamilton Holt, in an address before the recent 
national convention of newspaper men, allowed 
himself to take a roseate view of the possibilities of 
endowed journalism. He maintains: "If a journal 
is to perform the two essential duties of careful 
news-gathering and competent comment, it must 
have an assured income of sufficient amount at the 
start to enable it to stand the stress of sensational 
and commercialized competitors and to demonstrate 
its usefulness to a large circle of readers all over 
the country. Once established and recognized as a 
truthful and important medium, it would have an 
enormous educational value. Though it might not 
be read by the millions, it would be indispensable 
to all libraries, journalists, preachers, teachers, the 
most intelligent professional and business men, and 
the leaders at least of the wage-earning class. It 
would also exert a great influence for good on other 
papers by forcing them to raise their standards of 
accuracy and fairness." After all, that is not a hope- 
lessly idealistic view of the possibilities of endowed 

journalism.

THE DESIRE FOR INFORMATION ON A GREAT 

VARIETY OF SUBJECTS, on the part of those whose 
indolence or inexperience makes them quite willing 
that others should do their research work for them, 
is probably manifest nowhere more than in the 
" Questions and Answers " department of a literary 
newspaper or the Reference department of a public 
library. In some of these journals, columns in each 
issue are given to such inquiries, suggesting the 
probable desire for material for essays, club papers, 
school themes, etc., whjch can be obtained in this free 
and easy way. The questions that come, modestly 
but profusely, to the Reference department of pub- 
lic libraries are of wider range and usually of more 
curious interest than those that aspire to the promi- 
nence of print. The Annual Report of the librarian 
of the public library at Santa Barbara, Cal., gives 
the following list of topics among those on which 
information was sought at that library in a single 
day: Date-palm culture; open-air schools; natural 
gas ; folding napkins at table ; spirit mediums ; the 



Yosemite ; heroism of Jack Binns ; legends and super- 
stitions of precious stones; steam boilers; Roman 
home-life ; parcels post ; High Jinks of the Bohemian 
Club; carriage painting; the Pentateuch; canoes; 
camels ; George Washington ; author of the poem 
"There is no death," etc. " Many of these questions," 
says the librarian, "are answered with the aid of 
the standard reference books and the indexes to peri- 
odical literature ; others involve search in out-of-the- 
way places." We should think they would ! But in 
any case, the Reference department of a properly 
equipped public library cheerfully and eagerly opens 
its doors to just such inquirers as these, and the 
librarian stands ready to greet them with smiling 
mien and to lend a helping hand in their researches. 


To LOVERS OF THE ENGLISH LAKE DISTRICT, 

with all its precious associations, an appeal is made 
for help in preserving the region from disfigurement 
at the hands of builders. Canon H. D. Rawnsley 
writes from Crosthwaite Vicarage, Keswick, in part 
as follows : " The head of Windermere, comprising 
the meadow land between the mouth of the river 
Rotha and Waterhead, and including within its area 
the important Roman camp in the Borrans Field, 
was just about to be built upon ; indeed, the turf was 
off and foundations of two lodging-houses were laid, 
when the neighborhood woke up to the fact that un- 
less these twenty acres could be secured and handed 
to the custody of the National Trust, there was an 
end for all time of the peculiar charm and beauty 
of the head of Windermere. Your readers will 
remember how attractive that beauty is as they ap- 
proach Waterhead near Ambleside by steamer from 
the south. They will call to mind the exquisite set- 
ting of the verdurous level with its background of 
Loughrigg Fell, and the blue hollow of the circling 
wall of Fairfield with its gray scars and dark woods 
above Rydal Hall. They will understand how, quite 
apart from the historic interest of securing the as yet 
unexcavated Roman camp, it is essential that the 
pastoral loveliness of that approach to the Ambleside 
valley should be preserved, and will not, I trust, be 
surprised that I urge America to help the old country 
for Wordsworth's sake to preserve its ancient heri- 
tage of calm and beauty to succeeding generations." 
The writer of this letter, who signs himself as "Hon. 
Secretary to the National Trust," adds that twenty- 
four hundred pounds, of the four thousand needed to 
purchase the threatened piece of ground, has already 
been raised, the immediate vicinity contributing from 
its slender means three-quarters of the amount. Any 
Americans who " have known the restf ulness of the 
as yet unspoiled parts of the English lake district," 
and feel prompted to aid in preserving that restful- 
ness, will earn the gratitude of all future tourists and 
sojourners in that peculiarly beautiful region of rural 
England. . . . 

MACHINE-MADE FICTION has its ready market 
and its eager readers, as all the world knows, and as 
is made evident by the confessions of a plot-builder 



184

who tells some of the tricks of his trade to readers 
of the London " Answers." His brain produces plots 
with ease and abundance, but he himself cannot so 
clothe them as to render them acceptable to editors 
and publishers. Therefore he sells these skeletons 
of stories and novels to writers of more skill with 
their pens, and his earnings amount to four or five 
pounds a week, the day's work being often com- 
pleted before breakfast by this dextrous framer of 
plots at prices ranging from ten to twenty shillings, 
according to complexity. "My principal client," 
says this ingenious craftsman, " gets rid of about 
one hundred and fifty stories a year. He has a 
splendid style, and, singularly enough, although he 
possesses a vivid imagination, he is a bad hand at 
evolving plots. Give him the plot, and he will go 
along like a steam engine. . . . My clients number 
fewer than half a dozen, and if a plot does not suit 
one of them it will probaby appeal strongly to 
another, who makes a good story of it. So that a 
plot is seldom, if ever, wasted. What is more, it is 
possible to get at least four different plots out of one 
central idea. It can be twisted and turned about, 
given a different ending or development, and new 
names bestowed on the characters, and the trick is 
done." How beautiful! Perhaps some day there 
will be invented a mechanical contrivance for pro- 
ducing all the possible combinations of all the known 
elements of plot-construction ; then, with an adequate 
supply of phonographs, type-writers, and similar 
appliances, a fiction-factory ought to turn out hun- 
dreds of stories, all of standard grade and finish, 
every working day of the year. 



THE DORMANT LIBRARY TRUSTEE may be less 
worrisome to the librarian than the rampant or 
officiously meddlesome, fussy, and bustling trustee. 
For we have all kinds, including an increasing num- 
ber of intelligently active and helpful trustees ; but 
that they have more of this latter sort across the 
Canadian border than south of it seems to some 
observers to have been indicated by the quality of 
the attendance at the late Ottawa conference of 
library workers. "The Library Journal" says, in its 
"Ottawa Conference Number" (August) : "One of 
the most interesting features of the Ottawa meeting 
was the large attendance of trustees, particularly from 
Canad#. Over the border, the trustee has been quite 
as important as the librarian in developing the pub- 
lic library, and there has indeed been some question 
whether the librarian, as such, had not been too much 
subordinated by this fact. The contrary is true in 
the States, for here trustees are apt to confine them- 
selves to the finances of the library and not even 
support the librarian as they should by informing 
themselves of the practical work and giving it the 
strength of their well-informed support." The sad 
truth is that, on this side the boundary at least, 
politics plays havoc with too many a board of library 
trustees, as also with too many a school committee, 
and with other public offices of trust and importance. 
These positions are often sought as stepping-stones 



to something higher that is, more lucrative, and 
usually they are in part filled by ex-officio members 
with no especial qualifications for the work to be 
done. In general, smaller library boards of picked 
men (and women) are desirable. 



A MONUMENTAL INDEX to a monumental edition 
is that comprised in the final volume (the thirty- 
ninth) of the complete "Library Edition" of Rus- 
kin, edited by Sir E. T. Cook and Mr. Alexander 
Wedderburn. The index comprises seven hundred 
double-columned octavo pages of fine type, the num- 
ber of references exceeding 150,000. Every topic 
treated or mentioned by Ruskin, and every proper 
name mentioned in his works, are included. And 
this is by no means all. The topical references are 
so grouped as to form a practical analysis of Rus- 
kin's teaching on whatever subject. " I have left the 
system of my teaching widely scattered and broken, 
hoping always to bind it together," Ruskin once said ; 
but there was no time in his heroically busy life 
that could be spared for such a project. Now at last 
it has been carried through by his devoted editors, 
and in a way that could not be bettered. The tangled 
tropical forest of Ruskin's writings has here been 
tracked and charted for all time. As an instance 
of the appalling amount of labor expended in the 
making of this volume, it may be noted that of the 
thousands of quotations and allusions scattered 
through Ruskin's books, all but sixteen are here 
traced and recorded ! A supplementary volume (the 
thirty-eighth) contains, besides a complete anno- 
tated catalogue of Ruskin's drawings, a Bibliography 
which for inclusiveness and exactness is not likely 
ever to be superseded. Thus is brought to a fitting 
conclusion one of the noblest memorials ever dedi- 
cated to a great writer, a labor of love on the part 
of editors and publishers not easily to be paralleled 
in modern literary annals. 

THE FINAL FALL OF THE AUCTIONEER'S HAMMER 

ON THE HOE LIBRARY is announced by the Ander- 
son Company for the fortnight beginning November 
11. Thus will end, after four memorable sales, the 
dispersal of the richest private collection of books 
and manuscripts ever sold in this country. From 
the day of the opening sale, when a copy of the 
Gutenberg Bible brought fifty thousand dollars, the 
highest recorded price for a single item at a book- 
auction, the amounts bid for these literary rarities 
have been unprecedentedly large, so that the total 
sum realized by the completed sale is likely to exceed 
two million dollars. Probably to most readers it 
would be but a tantalizing kindness to name here 
any of the choice items enumerated in the catalogue 
of this fourth and final section of Robert Hoe's re- 
markable library. Forty-six manuscripts, many of 
them illuminated, are on the list; also books from 
the libraries of Jean Grolier, Henry the Second and 
Henry the Third, Louis the Fourteenth, Louis the 
Fifteenth, and Louis the Eighteenth, Madame de 
Maintenon, Madame du Barry, Marie Antoinette,

and Charles the Second of England, many of the 
volumes being magnificently bound. Noteworthy 
Americana and Shakespeariana, and some rare early 
English books are also named. With both the Hoe 
and the Huth sales in progress, millionaire collectors 
have ample opportunity to ease the congestion of 
their bank accounts. . . . 

A WARNING FROM THE "ARABIAN NlGHTS," to 

be found in "The Story of the Grecian King and 
the Physician Douban," needs to be occasionally 
repeated for the benefit of those unthinking readers 
who indulge in the practice of turning the leaves of 
books with fingers moistened by the tongue. The 
first part of this story, down to the King's death 
(caused by his thus turning the leaves of the poi- 
soned folio), might profitably be posted in libraries, 
especially in reading-rooms, perhaps side by side 
with the now familiar verses about the untidy Goops 
whose bad habits with books are held up to the rep- 
robation of all well-bred children and as a horrible 
example to the ill-bred. A lecture dealing in part 
with the perils lurking in the slovenly practice here 
referred to was recently delivered at the University 
of Pennsylvania by Mr. William R. Reinick, and 
has been published in "The American Journal of 
Pharmacy." Although we moderns may be yielding 
to a tendency to make too much of a bogy of bacteria 
and microbes and germs (all undreamt-of by our 
hale and hearty ancestors), still there is good sense 
in Mr. Reinick's counsel to librarians to give due 
attention to the physical condition of each volume 
passing to and from the public. Frequent hand- 
washing on the part of library employees is advised ; 
and even a compulsory ceremony of this sort on the 
visitor's part, before using the reference books, is 
suggested. The spread of tuberculosis is what is 
especially to be feared as a result of untidy habits 
with books. ... 

MR. SANBORN AT EIGHTY-ONE, or close to it, and 
with his vigor renewed, as is to be hoped, by the re- 
cent celebration of his golden wedding, presents a 
pleasing appearance to the mind's eye in his Concord 
home, where he enjoys the distinction (not quite free 
from melancholy, it is true) of being the last sur- 
vivor of that illustrious company whose names are 
now mostly to be read on the grave-stones of Sleepy 
Hollow. He still continues his connection with the 
Springfield " Republican," which he first served as 
associate editor forty-four years ago, afterward be- 
coming its regular contributor from Boston and Con- 
cord. The " Boston Literary Letter," furnished by 
him once a week, has long been a prominent feature 
of the journal. In it he allows himself the privilege 
of his years and writes in a genially discursive vein, 
with splendid disregard of the ephemeral favorites 
of the book-world, and with a fine harking-back to 
whatsoever things are imperishable in literature. 
Those who visit him find him still reading the Greek 
classics as the rest of us read novels and contempo- 
rary memoirs. Turning the leaves of his two sub- 
stantial volumes of reminiscences, a rich store of 



unusually interesting memories, there come to one 
the words put by Cicero into the mouth of the elder 
Cato : " Fructus autem senectutis est, ut saepe dixi, 
ante partorum bonorum memoria et copia." 



A PUBLIC LIBRARY WITH NO DEAD BOOKS, that IS, 

with no books that have ceased to circulate, might 
seem, from all the recent criticism of the staleness 
and uselessness of much of the material that cum- 
bers the shelves of so many libraries, to be as rare 
as, for example, a city with no idle inhabitants, or 
a swarm of bees with no drones. But Redlands, 
California, appears to be blessed with such a library. 
The collection numbers more than twenty thousand 
volumes, and its accumulation covers nearly a score 
of years ; yet we read in the " Eighteenth Annual 
Report" of the library : 

" In making out the annual budget at the beginning of the 
calendar year, it was thought that the expense of a new book 
case might be avoided this year by the removal of some of the 
books which had not been used, to the basement. It was esti- 
mated that about 1000 books might thus be transferred, and 
by marking the catalogue cards, they could easily be found 
in case they were called for. But on looking over the shelves 
in order to weed out the dead material it was found that so 
few books could be spared from the shelves that almost none 
were suitable for the basement. This does not mean that all 
the books had been circulated, for it would have been com- 
paratively easy to find a thousand books on the shelves which 
had not been loaned for two years or more, but the condition 
of the books and the requests made at the delivery desk 
showed that they were very generally in use at the library. 
This seems to be an unusual condition of affairs, if we may 
judge from some of the criticisms reported through the press 
of the country that a fair proportion of the shelves of public 
libraries are loaded down with dead material. It also speaks 
most highly of the careful selection which has been made by 
the Book Committee." 

THE GOLDWIN SMITH LECTURES AT CORNELL 
will be inaugurated under favorable auspices in the 
course of the coming college year. Professor Albert 
Frederick Pollard, who occupies the chair of English 
history at London University, has been invited to 
deliver the first series. An Oxford " first-class " 
scholar and a winner of various academic prizes, he 
has devoted his talents to the service of one of the 
people's universities and has also made a name for 
himself as a well-equipped historical writer. In 
addition to his lives of Thomas Cranmer and Henry 
the Eighth, and his " Factors in Modern History," 
and other kindred works, he has contributed some 
fifty articles to the new " Encyclopaedia Britannica " 
and what would amount to an entire volume to the 
" Dictionary of National Biography," of which he 
was assistant editor from 1893 to 1901. Six chap- 
ters of the " Cambridge Modern History " are also 
from his pen, and volume six of the " Political His- 
tory of England." One marvels at the extent and 
the substantial quality of his literary work work 
that, in a sense, must be regarded as executed with 
the left hand while the energy of his right is given 
to his professorship and to his duties as member of 
the University Senate. Truly, it would seem that 
Professor Pollard has learned the art of living on 
twenty-four hours a day.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 



THE APPRAISAL OF CONTEMPORARY 
GREATNESS. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

As your readers probably include many persons who 
might be interested in a project like the Modern His- 
toric Records Association, will you permit me to make 
in your columns a mild protest against the note of flip- 
pancy that crops out in your otherwise pleasant comment 
(in your issue of August 16) on my letter to the New 
York "Sun," and to correct some small errors that 
appear in your criticism. 

The collection of autographic utterances on parch- 
ment by men and women of genius is only a minor 
undertaking of our Association. Its objects embrace 
the use of the photographic plate as the most durable 
means of preserving records and documents; of the 
phonograph, for the preservation of the utterances of 
celebrities; of moving-picture machines in obtaining 
records of important events; and the application of all 
other suitable means for transmitting to posterity a 
vivid and comprehensive record of the life and civiliza- 
tion of the day. 

The names of our incorporators should be a sufficient 
assurance of the worth and dignity of our aims. These 
endeavors including even the " diversion " of obtain- 
ing autographic names have (and has) elicited the 
warm approval of Mr. Frederic Harrison, who many 
years ago conceived an enterprise startlingly like our 
own, and wrote of it with eloquence heightened by humor 
in an essay entitled, "A Pompeii for the Thirtieth 
Century." 

Respecting my list of so-called "immortals," the 
attempt to compile it bears a certain relation to the 
estimates, however fallible, we must inevitably make of 
the various products of contemporary civilization of 
which we shall seek to preserve some record. The list 
of names published in the " Sun " was explicitly denned 
as imperfect and incomplete. I submitted only 121 
names, and not " about two hundred " as you say. I 
should like to make it 200, and that is why I invited 
suggestions, and why I am grateful for your own. 

This accounts for my " many surprising omissions," 
though you overlooked my inclusion of Sun Yat Sen. 
The Mikado, moreover, came within the " arbitrary 
group " of rulers. I have been awaiting competent ad- 
vice and suggestion for augmenting the list of Orientals. 

As for my " astonishing inclusions," I could wish that 
you had been more specific. A few of the names will, 
on further consideration, doubtless be deleted. A " ten- 
tative list "is a tentative list. Also, I would cite, in 
extenuation of my avowed temerity, the " astonishing 
inclusions " and " surprising omissions " in every list of 
" best dead authors " from Sir John Lubbock's down 
to Dr. Eliot's; while the Hall of Fame committee's ex- 
clusion of Poe and inclusion of well, no matter are 
probably fresh in your mind. Finally, I should like THE 
DIAL'S frank opinion of all the names in the Nobel 
prize list, and to hear its editor recite, without a 
prompter, the names of all the members of the French 
Academy. Most of all I should cherish its views on 
our own American Academy of Immortals crowned 
by far more competent hands than mine. It has fallen 
to my lot to question, in public print, this appraisement 
of native reputations. That I have not found it convinc- 
ing as a guide to my own compilation is possibly a mani- 



festation of ignorance and narrow-mindedness. But at 
least I do not regard our own " diversion" with the over- 
seriousness which you somehow read into my letter to 
the "Sun." W. T. LARNED, 

Secretary of the M. H. R. A. 
New York, September 5, 1912. 

[If the tone of our comment sounded flippant, we 
regret it ; but is it not pardonable to feel at least a 
mild temptation to smile at the serious attempts of 
either an individual or a generation to measure and 
weigh, grade and classify his (or its) own excellences ? 
so often does the verdict of posterity reverse the 
most carefully considered judgment of this sort. The 
phrase " about two hundred " was written with the 
writer's eye on that passage in Mr. Larned's letter 
which speaks of the purpose " to assemble a list of, 
say, two hundred names," and without an actual 
count of his list. Surprise at certain inclusions and 
omissions would be excited, in some quarters, by any 
conceivable list of this kind, and we should be the 
last to claim ability to frame one that would not aston- 
ish all its readers by some of its items and some of its 
readers by all its items. We think, however, that 
Mr. Larned's tentative roll of honor shows most cred- 
itable care and judgment. EDB. THE DIAL.] 



SOME DISPUTED POINTS IN THE STORY OF 

OLD FORT DEARBORN. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Permit me to comment upon the review of my book, 
" The Story of Old Fort Dearborn," which appeared 
in your issue of the 1st instant, signed by Milo Milton 
Quaife. 

In order to understand the state of mind of this re- 
viewer, when confronted with my book, it will be neces- 
sary to refer to his previous utterances on this subject. 
About a year ago Mr. Quaife was invited to read a 
paper on the Chicago Massacre before the Mississippi 
Valley Historical Association, which he did. It turned 
out to be a violent tirade against the authenticity of the 
" Wau-Bun " account of that event, an account which 
had been accepted as a most reliable and indeed the 
principal source of our knowledge on the subject. 

Naturally considerable surprise and disapproval were 
manifested among those who listened to the paper, and 
on being reported in the newspapers it occasioned some 
rather bitter controversy. Regarding the incidents re- 
lated by Mrs. Kinzie in " Wau-Bun," the lecturer held 
them up to scorn, using such expressions as " inherent 
improbability," " incredible tale," " probably largely 
fictitious," "grotesque," and declaring the defects of 
the work were " numerous and glaring " and the facts 
distorted. Indeed, throughout the address there was a 
constant flow of epithets and strained inferences. 

Since that time Mr. Quaife has been endeavoring, 
through the Chicago Historical Society, to secure a fur- 
ther hearing for his radical views, but so far he has not 
seemed to be very successful. In reviewing my book, 
which is frankly based on the "Wau-Bun " account, with 
such additional details as have become available since 
that book was written, Mr. Quaife has transferred his 
denunciations to my work and its author. He finds that 
the book " is for the most part a paraphrase " of " Wau- 
Bun " though he fails to mention the fact that it is ampli-

fied and adapted and its order changed. Any complete 
account of the event described, it may be said, could not 
, be written without going back to that indispensable 
source. 

Some of the matters in my book criticised by Mr. 
Quaife may be noticed. One of my statements was to 
the effect that Mrs. Heald was " nearly as old as her 
uncle " Captain Wells, who was about forty-two years 
of age. The reviewer oracularly observes that she was 
but twenty-two years old. In answer I would refer to 
Fergus's Historical Pamphlet, No. 16, in which John 
Wentworth quotes from information obtained by him 
that Mrs. Heald died in 1857, aged 81 years. That 
would make her thirty-six years old in 1812. Perhaps 
Mr. Quaife has better information than this, but I 
doubt it. 

He declares that the name of the Frenchman Debou 
was Cardin. Kirkland, in his book on " The Chicago 
Massacre," says it was as I gave it. 

The order for the evacuation, according to Mrs. 
Kinzie, was received August 7, as I gave it. Captain 
Heald, however, in his report gives it as the 9th, which 
is doubtless the better authority, and I will adopt it. 

The date of beginning the construction of Fort Dear- 
born is given in my book as July 4, 1803. This the 
reviewer roughly contradicts, and declares that the 
troops did not arrive until some six weeks later. Hon. 
Isaac N. Arnold, in an address before the Chicago His- 
torical Society in July, 1877, in speaking of the building 
of the fort, said: "Some companies of infantry, under 
command of Maj. [Captain] John Whistler, arrived at 
the same time 4th July and commenced the con- 
struction of Fort Dearborn." This was good authority 
up to a period as recent as August 11 last, when there 
was printed in the Chicago " Record-Herald " of that 
date an account, heretofore existing only in manuscript 
form, of Lieut. Swearingen's march overland with the 
troops who were to build the new fort, and who arrived 
on August 17. The account thus printed was accom- 
panied by some explanatory remarks by Mr. Quaife, who 
said that the manuscript was in the possession of the 
Chicago Historical Society, and had been "brought to 
light recently." As soon as I saw this account I deter- 
mined to make a corresponding change in a later edition 
of my book, which was then already in print, accepting 
this as better authority for the date of beginning the 
work of building. It is quite characteristic of this re- 
viewer, however, to give the impression that I ought to 
have known what had not yet come to public knowledge, 
and thus disingenuously make it appear as an error 
which could have been avoided. 

What reason Captain Heald may have had for pro- 
posing to distribute the arms and ammunition to the 
Indians, in spite of his orders from Gen. Hull to de- 
stroy them, does not appear. We only know that he 
promised them he would do so. The reviewer says that 
" it is obvious " that this story, " together with state- 
ments concerning the resentment of the Indians . . . 
are inventions." Such a remark is harsh and offensive. 
Mrs. Kinzie in her book says that at the second council 
with the Indians "murmurs and threats were every- 
where heard among the savages." Whatever estimate 
the reviewer may place on my authority, it is clear at 
any rate that I was not guilty of inventing anything. 

The transfer of Capt. Whistler to Fort Wayne, as I 
stated it, has the respectable authority of H. H. Hurlbut 
(p. 27), in fact it is much better authority in my belief 
than the off-hand declarations of Mr. Quaife, who ap- 



parently considers that his dictum " settles it " without 
troubling to mention an authority. He sneeringly states 
that Gen. Dearborn's services on the Niagara frontier 
were " doubtless ' distinguished ' " (using my expres- 
sion), but that they were " hardly so in the sense intended 
by the author." It is enough to say that just as the 
war of 1812 was closing President Madison had deter- 
mined to appoint Dearborn general-in-chief of the whole 
army, but was prevented by the return of peace; and it 
is hardly to be supposed that this appointment could 
have been contemplated unless Dearborn had already 
acquitted himself to the satisfaction of the president. 

The reviewer remarks with a superior air that " Sur- 
geon John Cooper" was an unmarried man, and was not 
killed at the massacre, as I had stated, that " he had 
resigned the service and left Fort Dearborn over a year 
before." I did not say " Surgeon John Cooper," but I 
did place the words " surgeon's mate " after the name 
of John Cooper, quite a different matter. For some 
reason John Cooper, the surgeon's mate, did leave the 
service the year before, as the reviewer says. Now, 
whether the astute reviewer knew it or not, he ought to 
have known that there was a man by the name of Cooper 
(first name not known) who was at Fort Dearborn at 
the time of the massacre, that he was killed, and that he 
had a wife and daughter who survived him. Previous 
writers have confused these two men, as I did. The 
story of the Cooper who was killed is given in Fergus's 
Historical Series, No. 16, pp. 54, 56. The reviewer had 
become aware of this fact while rummaging through the 
details of a wretched feud that existed among the 
officers and the people of the neighborhood a year or 
two before the massacre (as appears in the address re- 
ferred to), which gives him occasion to make a partial 
statement intended to be injurious to me. 

The reviewer finds that my book " reveals no evidence 
of the exercise of a critical faculty." His review is 
possibly a specimen of the exercise of such a faculty; 
but joined with a narrow and contentious disposition, 
such as he exhibits, I believe it will strike the fair- 
minded reader as a most undesirable accomplishment. 
To examine the minute merits of every historical ques- 
tion touched upon would have defeated the purpose for 
which my book was written, : a point that the reviewer 
misses entirely. If, for example, I had entered upon a 
discussion of the merits of Gen. Dearborn's services on 
the Niagara frontier it would, in my judgment, have 
been regarded by most readers as a needless digression 
remote from the subject-matter of the book. In fact, 
to have done so would have been to awaken the con- 
troversial activities of just such men as this reviewer 
shows himself to be. He would have such a story as I 
have written prepared in the manner of a thesis, a 
manner that would only have served to repel the class 
of readers such as I intended to attract. 

I will close this letter with a quotation, which is per- 
haps appropriate. A certain wise old philosopher, Sir 
Thomas Browne, in the course of some general advice 
to critics, wrote as follows : 

"Bring candid eyes unto the perusal of men's works, 
and let not Detraction blast well-intended labors. He that 
endureth no fault in man's writings must only read his own. 
. . . Capital truths are to be narrowly eyed, collateral lapses 
and circumstantial deliveries not to be too strictly sifted. 
And if the substantial subject be well forged out, we need not 
examine the sparks which irregularly fly from it."

RETROSPECTS or A RETIRED WAR 
VETERAN.* 



Those who fought in, or lived through, or 
even heard some faint dying echoes of our 
Civil War, will not soon tire of reading its 
history as told from many points of view by 
those whose valor and ability helped to bring 
it to a fortunate termination. To the list of 
noteworthy military memoirs penned by Amer- 
ican soldier-authors there is now added General 
James Harrison Wilson's detailed and interest- 
ing recollections of his eventful campaigns in 
the great struggle of half a century ago and 
of his less sanguinary experiences in the short 
conflict with Spain. "Under the Old Flag" 
traces, in two stout volumes, the course of its 
writer's life from boyhood in a small Illinois 
town through the formative years of a West 
Point training, the hardening and ripening 
years of military service immediately afterward, 
at the outbreak of the Civil War, the subse- 
quent campaigns in which promotion and in- 
creased responsibilities were not slow to follow, 
the peaceful interval of a third of a century, 
and the parts played in the war with Spain, the 
reconstruction of Cuba, and the suppression of 
the Boxers in China. 

Only a few of the most prominent features 
of so extensive a work can be touched upon in 
any general survey of its merits. New lights 
on some of our national heroes, fresh views of 
certain historic events, a fuller realization of 
perils encountered and difficulties overcome by 
the shapers of our country's destinies these 
are afforded by the graphic narrative before us. 
To begin with the school days of the future 
brigadier and division-commander, here is a 
paragraph from the account of his studies at 
West Point : 

" At the end of the [first] year, although I had started 
next to foot, I was in the first or second section in all 
the studies. My two terms at college had been of great 
advantage in teaching me how to study. I had no diffi- 
culty in any branch, and did my daily task easily enough, 
and, after a few months, had plenty of time left for 
general reading. This was the case to the end of my 
cadet life. The library contained some twenty thousand 
volumes, largely military, but all fairly well selected, 
and, although nothing was done to encourage its use, or 
to guide the cadets in the selection of books, it was free 
to all who had time or inclination to visit it after study 
hours or on holidays. I soon made the acquaintance of 

*UNDER THE OLD FLAG. By James Harrison Wilson, 
LL.D., late Major-General, U. S. V. In two volumes. New 
York : D. Appleton & Co. 



Fries, the curator. During my first encampment I read 
Story's ' Constitutional Law ' and a general assortment 
of romance and history, and after that not only became 
a steady patron of it, but close friends with the kindly 
Fries, who had a wonderful memory, and was most help- 
ful in introducing me to his treasures. As I grew older 
he became more considerate, and I hold him in grateful 
memory for his unfailing kindness. The instructors came 
and went, but he remained at his post, not only for my 
term, but for long years afterward, and if 1 should be 
called upon to say who did me the most good and helped 
me most to equip myself for the duties of life, I should 
unhesitatingly say Andrd Fries, the old librarian." 

In the war that followed soon after the cadet's 
graduation from West Point, he served first in 
the Port Royal expedition, afterward in the 
Antietam campaign, and was then assigned to 
various duties in rather rapid succession, and 
with equally rapid promotion from a lieutenancy 
to higher and higher offices until we find him 
commanding a division of Sheridan's cavalry, 
afterward organizing and commanding a cavalry 
corps of the Military Division of the Mississippi, 
then directing the assault upon and capture of 
Selma and Montgomery and other positions in 
the South, and, finally, effecting the pursuit and 
capture of Jefferson Davis. Many famous gen- 
erals, as Grant, Sherman, McClellan, Hooker, 
under or with whom he fought, pass across the 
writer's pages in an almost living and breathing 
reality. Two peculiar regrets in connection with 
this excellent record are felt by the author, who 
says in an early chapter : 

" Looking back on my military life, I have only two 
regrets in connection with it : first, that I was never an 
enlisted man in the infantry or cavalry, because, with 
my health, activity, powers of endurance, and skill in 
handling a rifle and a horse, I always felt that I would 
have been as good a soldier as could be found anywhere 
in the ranks, while I was far from having the same con- 
fidence in my capacity as a commissioned officer ; and, 
second, that I was never a prisoner of war, because I 
felt that the privation and ill treatment of that fate 
would have stimulated me to even greater determination 
and services in behalf of the Union cause." 

Like any other full account of our military 
operations in 1861-65, General Wilson's narra- 
tive makes the reader vividly aware of the blun- 
ders committed, the disasters narrowly escaped, 
the un skill and unreadiness displayed, at the 
opening of the war, and the seeming ease with 
which, under wiser direction, the conflict could 
have been brought to a close long before its 
actual end. For example, had a younger and 
more alert man than the veteran Scott been at 
the head of the army when hostilities began, how 
different might have been the course of subse- 
quent events ! But the writer pays appropriate 
tribute to General Scott's merits. In contrast- 
ing him with another Virginian, Lee, he says : 



1912.J 



THE DIAI, 



189 



" In these later days when it is the fashion to mag- 
nify the virtues of Lee, not only as a military man, but 
as a patriot, it seems to me that the country is in danger 
of forgetting its immense debt of gratitude to General 
Scott, who was fully Lee's equal as a soldier and far 
greater than Lee as a patriot. His conquest of Mexico 
was a performance of the first rank and that is more 
than can be said of Lee's best campaign. Scott's patri- 
otism, unlike Lee's, was neither provincial nor bounded 
by state lines, but was national and all-embracing. He 
gave his services at all times and all places to the whole 
country, without hesitation and without question. Like 
Douglas, his example was worth an army to the Union 
cause. All eyes were, indeed, turned to the veteran 
Brevet Lieutenant General Scott, second of that rank 
in America, for inspiration and guidance, and no one 
looked to him with more anxiety than Lincoln, the newly- 
elected President. Happily both for him and the cause 
he upheld, Lincoln did not look in vain. The old soldier, 
staggering under the weight of years, put behind him 
all appeals to state pride and, like an old and seasoned 
oak, stood erect and unbending amid the raging storm 
of secession and civil war." 

The following passage presents Grant in a 
guise not too familiar to be interesting. It was 
Grant's influence and favor that acted most 
powerfully in securing the author's recognition 
as an able organizer and commander, and his 
promotion to rank befitting his quality. Of 
the impression made by the older man on the 
younger at their first meeting we read : 

" Putting on no airs whatever and using nothing but 
the mildest and cleanest language, he treated me from 
the start with cordiality and without the slightest as- 
sumption of personal or official superiority. As I after- 
ward learned, this was always his way, and while he 
invited no confidences, he repelled none, and thus got all 
that were worth having. Snowing no sign whatever of 
hard living or bad habits, he produced a pleasant but 
by no means striking impression at first. With what I 
heard from others, I naturally suspended judgment, and 
as my first orders were to join McPherson with the right 
wing of the army for the movement about to begin, 
instead of to settle down at headquarters and organize 
my branch of the staff service, I naturally got the im- 
pression that Grant was neither a great organizer nor 
much of a theorist in military matters. This opinion 
grew gradually into a settled conviction, and in spite of 
his great achievements, which were won mainly by atten- 
tion to broad general principles rather than to technical 
details, I have never had occasion to materially change 
these earlier impressions." 

It appears from General Wilson's account, 
that he and Major Eawlins first conceived, or 
first put into words, the plan, later adopted 
by Grant, of running the Vicksburg batteries 
by night. In a council of war held some time 
before the bold project was put into execution, 
all sorts of plans were discussed. We quote a 
portion of the narrative at this point: 

"Whereupon Rawlins explained my proposition to 
run the batteries under cover of darkness with the gun- 
boats and transports and march the troops below by 
land, to the first feasible crossing. 



" As Rawlins had predicted, Sherman at once and 
with emphasis declared: 'It can't be done. It is im- 
practicable. The transports will be destroyed. The 
enemy's guns will sink them or set them afire.' And 
that settled it for the time being, for although Rawlins 
gave the reasons clearly and emphatically for the faith 
that was in us, no one came to his support. Even Grant 
kept silent, though he tells us clearly enough in his 
memoirs, written many years afterward, that it was his 
purpose from the first to carry that plan into effect if 
the others failed." 

To refer at any length to the rather absurdly 
inconspicuous part assigned to General Wilson 
when he offered his services in the Spanish- 
American War, would exceed the limits allowed 
to this review. But he seems to have accepted 
his lot with the cheerful acquiescence of a true 
soldier. To gain a more intelligent appreciation 
of his character and worth one may turn to 
Nicolay and Hay's " Life of Lincoln," to which 
the present book makes pardonable reference. 
Among other notices of General Wilson, we 
read: 

"The ride of Wilson's troopers into Alabama was one 
of the most important and fruitful expeditions of the 
war. ... If the Confederacy had not already been 
wounded to death, the loss of Selma would have been 
irreparable. ... It justified by its celerity, boldness, 
and good judgment the high encomium with which 
Grant sent Wilson to Thomas." 

If still further aids are desired to an esti- 
mation of General Wilson's worth as a soldier, 
they are not far to seek. He is one of three 
brothers who served with distinction in the 
Civil War, and a tribute he pays to his brother 
Henry's bravery enables one to surmise what 
are likely to have been his own exhibitions of 
cool daring when put to the test. He writes 
of Henry: 

" He had early become known to the leading generals 
as an active and fearless officer and an excellent drill- 
master with remarkable presence of mind. He had led 
his company in the successful charge against the enemy's 
works at Donelson, had been shot through the body, as 
he thought, and paralyzed, had been pulled to cover 
under the hillside he had just surmounted, by a comrade 
who covered him with a blanket and left him for dead, 
had revived, cut a crutch, rejoined his company, and 
fought with it till night when the bullet was cut out of 
his back. Fortunately it had ' gone around, not through ' 
him. At. Shiloh he distinguished himself by leading his 
men to the capture of a battery and by turning it against 
the enemy. Having been drilled for a year at West 
Point, he was as much at home in the artillery as he was 
with the infantry. While working the captured guns, 
one of his gunners thoughtlessly dropped an armful 
of shrapnel near the muzzle of a piece, the flash from 
which set the wrappings on fire. Fearing an explosion, 
my brother, without tremor or a moment's hesitation, 
seized the shell and hurled it to the front where its 
explosion did no harm. It was in allusion to this and 
other gallant feats that General Oglesby, afterward 
senator and governor of Illinois, said with an emphatic

In fulness and readability, " Under the Old

appeared since General Howard gave us his two

"human interest," which it is the present fash- 
ion to clamor for, it would be difficult to indicate 
how the book could be improved.

IDEAL.S AND TENDENCIES IN PRESENT- 
DAY SOCIALISM.* 



There are two very decided tendencies to be 
noted in the pages of the lately published books 
dealing with socialism. First of all one feels 
that there is a very great desire on the part of 
the authors to "pull the sting" of the socialist 
teachings. One seeks in vain for the vigorous 
insistence upon the class-conscious, revolution- 
ary, Marxian programme which until the last 
few years has been so characteristic of socialist 
writers. In its stead there appears a jumble of 
Utopian, ethical, Christian socialist, and Fabian 
ideas, with a smattering of Marxian principles. 
To add to the confusion the result is frequently 
and falsely labelled "scientific" or " Marxian" 
socialism. While it is admittedly true that 
socialism is not a group of fixed and unchange- 
able dogmas, but primarily a growing, changing 
movement for social betterment, it seems ques- 
tionable under the circumstances for these later 
authors to classify their special brand of ideas 
as " Marxian." Every chance remark or state- 
ment of the founder of scientific socialism is 
searched out and used by them for the purpose 
of bolstering up their individual contentions. 
So widespread has this practice become that to- 
day Marx's writings and those of his co-worker, 
Engels, are about as frequently misquoted and 
misinterpreted to fit the particular situation as 
are those of the Biblical authors. 

In the second place one notes that more 
attention is being given to constructive ideas.

APPLIED SOCIALISM. A Study of the Application of 
Socialistic Principles to the State. By John Spargo. New 
York : B. W. Huebsch. 



In former years socialists were forced to con- 
cern themselves with critical and destructive 
arguments for the purpose of forcing the people 
to acknowledge that a change was imperative. 
Now that they have obtained a hearing and have 
gathered a rapidly-growing following, they deem 
it advisable to build for the future. In many 
instances the propositions advanced closely ap- 
proximate the Utopian schemes of the past ; in 
others they smack greatly of the progressive 
legislation proposed by social reformers. 

Both of these tendencies seem to have devel- 
oped out of the over-weening desire of a very 
large faction among the socialists to "get votes." 
The acquisition of political power appears to be 
the goal most desired at the present time by the 
members of the socialist movement. 

Miss Scudder's "Socialism and Character" 
is a unique contribution to socialist literature. 
The author discusses with some detail the prob- 
able moral and spiritual results of socialism, 
and concludes that under such a regime "the 
Beatitudes will no longer have to maintain 
themselves against the trend of things, but will 
become as truly the law for social progress as 
they are now the law for individual holiness." 
The book is a beautifully written essay of 
carefully chosen words, with frequent allusion 
to classical and modern literature. Its pages 
clearly disclose the extremely idealistic and intel- 
lectual, almost Christian socialist, point of view 
of its author. Although Miss Scudder claims to 
write as "a socialist a class-conscious, revolu- 
tionary socialist, if you will," she confesses 
that her attitude toward this question is that of 
one " to whom none the less the spiritual harvest, 
the fruits of character, are the only result worth 
noting in any economic order." Meekness, re- 
ligion, sympathy, affection, morality, love, gen- 
erosity, are words which give the keynote of the 
discussion. The thorough-going socialist will 
find much in the work to criticize. The author 
confesses that although she accepts the material- 
istic conception of history and the doctrine of 
the class struggle, "the construction here put on 
them will be foolishness and irritation to many a 
good Marxian." Miss Scudder's book is, how- 
ever, replete with stimulating and suggestive 
ideas ; and while it cannot appeal to the class- 
conscious, revolutionary political socialist, it will 
undoubtedly supply the need for just such a dis- 
cussion as Christian socialists and others have 
long felt. 

In " Socialism and the Ethics of Jesus," Pro- 
fessor Vedder first clears the field by defining 
socialism and differentiating it from other be-

lief s with which it is frequently confused ; after 
which he gives us a brief statement of the his- 
tory of socialist principles and parties in Ger- 
many, France, England, and the United States. 
Concluding chapters are devoted to an inquiry 
regarding the respects in which the principles of 
socialism correspond to or differ from the ethics 
of Jesus. Professor Vedder writes, not as a 
scientific socialist, but as a Christian socialist. 
This is evidenced, for example, by his declaration 
that " the real basis of Socialism is not scientific, 
but ethical" (p. 135). In fact, the author is 
bitter in his denunciation of scientific socialism. 
He characterizes the first volume of " Capital " 
as "thoroughly unscientific and misleading" 
(p. 136), and declares the whole Marxian system 
to be " as unsubstantial as moonshine " (p. 135). 
He also concludes that it is "time somebody 
punctured this swollen German windbag [Marx] 
and reduced it to its natural proportions" 
(p. 113). In discussing the labor theory of 
value, he shows a surprising lack of ac- 
quaintance with the theories of Marx as well as 
with those of modern economists. Probably it 
is this that accounts for the statement that the 
Marxian law holds that " the more unskilful a 
shoemaker, the more valuable will be the shoes 
that he makes" (pp. 118-119), and that Marx 
maintained that " wealth is produced by manual 
labor alone, and therefore of right belongs 
entirely to the manual laborer" (p. 125). The 
chapter on " The Ideals of Socialism " is espe- 
cially good, and shows that the author has an 
excellent grasp of the more popular arguments 
concerning conditions that may exist when the 
prophesied stage of socialism becomes a reality. 
In treating the relation of the ethics of Jesus 
to socialism, Professor Vedder severely criticizes 
the Church for what he terms its " social failure," 
and demands that it become " more socialized in 
all its thinking and activities." He says that 
" The teachings of Jesus are utterly incompatible 
with the present social order," and can only be 
truly realized under a socialistic regime. Social- 
ism and Christianity, he says, are not antago- 
nists but allies. They can do each other much 
good, because Christianity needs to be socialized, 
and socialism needs to be Christianized. The 
volume is excellently written, logically arranged, 
and makes a well-rounded discussion from the 
standpoint of a Christian socialist. Its general 
thoroughness and accuracy are somewhat marred 
by occasional rash and unfounded statements, 
and by a lack of appreciation of the principles 
of scientific socialism. A short but well-chosen 
bibliography accompanies each chapter. 



" Elements of Socialism," by Messrs. Spargo 
and Arner, is without doubt the best popular 
exposition of socialism by two of its advocates 
that has thus far been published. Although 
any opponent of socialist doctrines will find 
much in it with which to disagree, he will 
nevertheless be forced to admit that as a state- 
ment of the theories, ideals, history, and present 
strength of the socialist movement, it leaves but 
little if anything to be desired. The volume 
is thoroughly revisionist in its attitude toward 
socialist theories and tactics, and in point of 
view closely follows the previous writings of Mr. 
Spargo. Its weakest parts are those chapters 
that deal with the theories of value and surplus 
value. Although the authors have presented a 
clear statement of the Marxian theory of value, 
they experience the usual difficulty in making it 
a workable proposition. It is impossible for one 
to explain Marx's unit of value, "an hour of 
socially necessary unskilled labor," as it is also 
impossible for one to reduce skilled labor to 
terms of that unit. The authors are not very 
well grounded in the general field of theory, as 
is shown by their statements that "wealth is 
the product of a union of labor and the forces 
of nature" (p. 144), and that capital is "wealth 
that is used for the production of new wealth 
with a view to the realization of profit through 
its exchange" (p. 145). The ideals of Utopian 
as well as of scientific socialists are explained in 
detail. There is also a discussion of the relations 
which it is thought may exist in the political, 
social, and industrial spheres under socialism. 
A necessarily brief but generally satisfactory de- 
scription is given of the socialist movement in 
various countries. Many of the customary ob- 
jections urged against socialism are answered. 
A short summary, a list of questions, and a 
bibliography follow each chapter. The authors 
are to be congratulated upon this book. It is 
written in an optimistic and kindly vein, free 
from the bitterness and sarcasm that usually 
characterize socialist works. Although intended 
for use as a text-book, the fact that it presents 
but one side of the question will undoubtedly 
prevent its wide acceptance for the class-room.

of the collaborators are Marxian socialists ; sev- 
eral acknowledge that they are out-and-out non- 
socialists. The joint product is a volume of 
stimulating, enthusiastic, and optimistic predic- 
tions concerning the future. To the reader who 
possesses a progressive turn of mind there is 
nothing that will offend, while practically every- 
thing can be accepted in its entirety. Although 
the authors condemn the Fabian socialists in no 
uncertain terms, one finds much in the book 
that "out-Fabians the Fabians." The volume 
will appeal to members of the middle class, but 
it will receive scant appreciation at the hands 
of the Marxian socialists. 

Mr. Spargo in his new book on "Applied 
Socialism" keeps much closer to the working- 
class point of view than do the authors of 
"Socialism and the Great State." He begins 
by wisely warning the reader that his statements 
must not be accepted as "authoritative"; they 
are merely the ideas of a socialist who has at- 
tempted to sketch the conditions that may come 
to pass with the inauguration of the prophesied 
socialistic Cooperative Commonwealth. Will 
socialism result in the confiscation of property? 
Will it destroy the home? Will it be opposed 
to religion ? How will labor be compensated ? 
What will be the incentive to effort ? These, and 
many other equally important questions, the 
author attempts to answer frankly and conclu- 
sively. That he has succeeded in presenting the 
best and the most thorough-going study of the 
application of socialistic principles to the State, 
no one can deny. But in doing so, Mr. Spargo 
has exercised great generalship in threading his 
way amongst the mooted questions of construc- 
tive socialism. He has been exceptionally cau- 
tious and conservative in his presentation of the 
subject. There are parts of the volume that 
will be very severely criticized by the socialists, 
especially by the more radical advocates of social 
democracy. To the reviewer it seems that Mr. 
Spargo at one point has argued himself into a 
contradictory position by declaring that under 
socialism both the State and groups of workers 
engaged in voluntary cooperative industry may 
manufacture the same things. This will natur- 
ally lead to industrial competition of the very 
same sort that the socialists are so bitterly op- 
posed to in our present system of industry. Mr. 
Spargo argues for socialism because it would 
make industrial competition impossible, yet his 
scheme of things would make its retention pos- 
sible in a socialistic form of society. An index 
would have added to the value of the book.

THE RECORDS or THE FEDERAL, 
CONVENTION.* 

Upon the adjournment, on September 17, 
1787, of the Convention which framed the Con- 
stitution of the United States, no record of the 
proceedings of that body was made public. The 
sessions of the Convention had been secret, and 
the journal and papers kept by the secretary, 
William Jackson, were now by order turned 
over for safe-keeping to the presiding officer, 
George Washington. In 1796, Washington, 
then President of the United States, deposited 
these papers in the Department of State. There 
they remained until 1818, when Congress by 
joint resolution ordered them to be printed, 
and President Monroe found a willing editor in 
his Secretary of State, John Quincy Adams. 
Under Adams's care, the "journal" was pub- 
lished at Boston in 1819. 

This "journal" was but a cold statement of 
motions and votes, and gave but a very unsatis- 
factory insight into the springs of the Conven- 
tion's actions. But records of another form 
the unofficial soon made their appearance. 
These may be divided into two classes: first, 
notes made by members of the Convention dur- 
ing the sittings in Philadelphia, which have the 
authority of contemporary evidence ; and second, 
productions formal or informal written by mem- 
bers or by other persons after the adjournment 
of the Convention, which thus are dependent 
either upon notes of the former class or upon 
mere recollection, and indeed can be called " rec- 
ords" only in a qualified sense. In order of 
time, the second class just described was the first 
to appear in print. Even before the ratification 
of the Constitution by the Conventions of the 
several States, there had appeared such accounts 
as Charles Pinckney's " Observations " which, 
in addition to some remarks which Pinckney 
may have delivered before the Convention, con- 
tains, it is thought, some that he certainly did 
not and the partisan report of Luther Martin 
of Maryland, which he ingenuously entitled 
"Genuine Information," while later, after the 
inauguration of the new government, this or 
that matter of constitutional dispute brought 
from the surviving "fathers" statement after 
statement of their individual recollections of 
the Convention's work. 

Of unofficial records of the contemporary 
type, the first to be printed was the " Secret 
Proceedings and Debates" by Judge Yates of

New York. These notes, which had already 
been gleaned for partisan purposes, were pub- 
lished in 1821. Seven years later, some con- 
temporary notes taken by William Pierce of 
Georgia made their appearance in a Savannah 
newspaper. This publication was known to 
James Madison, but in general Pierce's notes 
had probably a very limited circulation. Both 
of these were eclipsed, however, when, in 1840, 
after the death of Madison, his papers, and more 
especially the famous notes which with skill and 
assiduity he took down during every day of the 
Convention's sitting, and which in his lifetime 
he jealously reserved from public view, were at 
last put into print and rendered accessible. 
Infelicitously spoken of as Madison's "Jour- 
nal" (for that word should be reserved for the 
official record), Madison's notes, reprinted in 
many forms, have ever since been familiar to all 
serious students of American history. 

This much of retrospect is necessary to under- 
stand fully the place occupied by a work which 
embodies a most important accomplishment of 
external criticism in the field of American his- 
tory, Professor Max Farrand's "Records of the 
Federal Convention of 1787," recently published 
in three large and handsome volumes by the 
Yale University Press. The title sufficiently 
indicates the general scope of the work; but a 
more detailed analysis of the contents is de- 
manded for the purposes of this review. In vol- 
umes one and two, Professor Farrand publishes 
for each day of the session of the Convention 
of 1787 the official "journal " and the unofficial 
records that are contemporary. In appendixes 
in volume three are printed some documents 
that properly go with the matter just described 
the credentials of the delegates to the Conven- 
tion, and the textual reconstruction, with criti- 
cal notes, of the various "plans" submitted by 
individuals or by groups of individuals for the 
consideration of the constituent body. We shall 
discuss these factors in the order in which they 
have been mentioned. 

The official "journal" of William Jackson, 
edited in 1819 carefully, but not without some 
errors, by John Quincy Adams, is reprinted by 
Professor Farrand from Jackson's manuscript, 
with indication of Adams's editorial emendations 
where such are found. Especially in determin- 
ing the distribution of the votes the ayes and 
noes upon particular questions has Professor 
Farrand found it necessary sometimes to correct 
Adams's editorial work. Passing from this to 
the unofficial records, and considering first those 
of the contemporary type, we find that Professor 



Farrand prints after the "journal" for each day 
the notes of Madison for that day, and similarly 
those of Yates and those of Pierce for each day 
concerning which either of these has anything to 
say. But this is not all. In recent years there 
have come to the knowledge of investigators 
other groups of contemporary notes, including 
those of Rufus King of Massachusetts, James 
McHenry of Maryland, William Paterson of 
New Jersey, Alexander Hamilton of New York, 
Charles Pinckney of South Carolina, and 
George Mason of Virginia ; while the papers of 
James Wilson and those of Benjamin Franklin 
of Pennsylvania also yield some fragments in 
the nature of records. These additions to our 
knowledge of the Convention's work, most of 
which have been printed originally or have been 
immediately reprinted in the "American His- 
torical Review," are now likewise transferred by 
Professor Farrand to take their place with the 
older "notes " in the diurnal account of the Con- 
vention's doings. This grouping in one place, 
for each day of the Convention's session, of the 
known contemporary accounts, official and unof- 
ficial, constitutes a boon to students and greatly 
facilitates an intensive study of the period. Pro- 
fessor Farrand's work, however, has not been 
merely the arranging of texts, for by a thor- 
.oughgoing critical examination of Madison's 
notes he shows that in some cases Madison made 
later emendations in his work, using as bases 
therefor the "journal" and Yates's notes, so to 
this extent weakening the value of his own ac- 
count as an independent authority. Similarly 
in his editing of the "plans" submitted to the 
Convention by the Virginia delegates, by the 
New Jersey men, by Charles Pinckney, and by 
Alexander Hamilton, Professor Farrand some- 
times reaches conclusions which differ from those 
of Professor A. C. McLaughlin and Dr. J. F. 
Jameson, his predecessors in this special field 
of criticism. 

From this analysis of the contemporary rec- 
ords we pass to the " supplementary materials," 
or later accounts of the work of the Convention, 
which constitute by far the greater part of Pro- 
fessor Farrand's third volume. The editor has 
gleaned diligently; and while the matter in- 
cluded under this head is of very heterogeneous 
character, and, as a whole, is secondary in im- 
portance to the main body of the work, it is of 
the greatest interest and most helpful toward 
the elucidation of the records. In this group 
are included the report of Luther Martin, and 
that of Pinckney to which we have already refer- 
red; letters of Washington, Hamilton, Madison, 



194 



[Sept. 16, 



and other "fathers"; reports of the French 
charge d'affaires to his home government; state- 
ments made in State conventions or in the Con- 
gress of the United States; and other similar 
materials. Rigorously excluded are all theo- 
retical interpretations of the Constitution ; one 
finds, therefore, no decisions of the Supreme 
Court, and from " The Federalist," or other con- 
troversial pamphlets, only a few citations which 
relate to matters of fact. The range of the testi- 
mony is wide, extending from Madison's most 
serious statements on constitutional points to 
Dr. Franklin's unfinished tale of the two-headed 
snake, and to the anecdote of Gouverneur Mor- 
ris's familiar slap upon General Washington's 
shoulder. 

Merely to suggest the capacity for usefulness 
that arises from such a compilation is to pay a 
sufficient tribute to the painstaking work which 
the editor has so well performed. To the re- 
viewer there appears to be ground for but one 
serious criticism. In 1894 the Department of 
State of the United States, through the Bureau 
of Rolls and Library, began the publication of 
a work entitled " The Documentary History of 
the Constitution," which in 1901 was reprinted 
by Congressional authority. To this work the 
thought of the special student is at once carried 
back by the contemplation of Professor Far-' 
rand's volumes. In the " Documentary History " 
were reprinted with scrupulous care the official 
"journal" and Madison's notes, along with the 
records of the earlier convention at Annapolis, 
some important selections from the journal of 
the Congress of the United States under the 
Articles of Confederation, a large number of 
documents relating to the history of the amend- 
ments to the Constitution, and lastly, in the 
fourth and fifth volumes (published in 1905), a 
mass of supplementary materials derived from 
the manuscript collections then in the Depart- 
ment of State. On this last group of materials, 
Professor Farrand has drawn heavily ; though 
the fact that his citations from the same docu- 
ments are frequently of less length than those of 
the "Documentary History" will make careful 
students prefer, after all, to consult the origin- 
als. For his narrower topic the work of the 
Constitutional Convention itself Professor 
Farrand has accomplished far more than the 
"Documentary History" accomplished, and his 
work is in many respects better done. But in 
the opinion of the reviewer the two productions 
have so much in common that a clear statement 
by Professor Farrand as to the relation of his 
own work to the older one would have been most 



helpful to the student. As it is, each person 
must make the comparison for himself. 

The general index, full in most respects, 
omits a few important topics. On the other 
hand, an analytical index by clauses of the 
Constitution promises a means of assistance 
the exact value of which must be tested by use. 
The typography of the volumes is of the highest 
excellence except for a few misprints which may 
easily be corrected in another edition. The only 
illustrations are two photographs, one showing 
a page of Jackson's "journal" and the other 
a page of Madison's notes. Finally may be 
mentioned, as a very helpful addition made by 
the editor, a table showing as accurately as the 
records permit the time during which each of 
the delegates to the Convention was actually in 



attendance.

RESEARCHES IN THE REALM OF 
FAERIE.* 



In his book on "The Fairy-Faith in Celtic 
Countries " Mr. Evans Wentz has set himself 
the somewhat startling task of endeavoring to 
prove in broad daylight the solid basis of fancies 
which have haunted most men in some moment 
of darkness or fear. All external nature, he 
argues, is animated throughout, and controlled 
in its phenomena, by daemons acting by the will 
of gods. The fairies of Celtic belief, along with 
the goblins, spectres, kobolds, etc., of all prim- 
itive folk, have a real basis in these mighty 
beings of the unseen, who may at certain times 
and places appear to favored observers. The 
author heaps up evidence of fairy belief from 
all Celtic lands, Ireland, Scotland, the Isle of 
Man, Wales, Cornwall, and Brittany; and con- 
cludes that where there is so much smoke there 
must be some fire. 

No sensible person will reprove Mr. Wentz 
for collecting and marshalling every possible 
evidence to prove his hypothesis. He is undeni- 
ably justified in keeping an open mind for all 
the truth that man can gather. But one has a 
right to expect that Mr. Wentz will somewhere 
in his big book call attention to the trivial and 
uncertain character of nearly all the facts that 
he has mustered. He ought in fairness to state 
his case somewhere with calmness and caution. 
His main argument that where there is so much 
smoke there must be some fire, is not very co- 
gent. Have we satisfied ourselves that this kind

THE DIAL 



195 



of smoke can be occasioned only by real fire? 
What if, after all, it should prove to be a cloud 
of dust? 

Mr. Wentz's reasoning is not based on clear 
and rigid analysis. He gives a place of honor, 
for example, to the argument that all primitive 
peoples, who have lived close to nature, have be- 
lieved in beings comparable to fairies. " Only 
men in cities," he says, " who are removed from 
the natural life of the out-of-door world," dis- 
believe. Mr. Wentz plays upon the word " nat- 
ural," and urges that life in cities is abnormal, 
and that the city man has an unwholesome and 
probably an untrue conception of nature. This 
argument rests upon a vague and shifting sig- 
nification of the word "natural." He surely 
does not mean that questions of fact are settled 
by popular vote. These are determined by the 
opinion of experts, and in the last analysis by 
recourse to experiment. It is not likely that 
the existence of .ST-rays would be affirmed by 
popular vote. The assertion that our disbelief 
in fairies is determined by the opinion of the 
swarms of human beings who live in crowded 
and unnatural conditions in cities, is nonsense. 
It is not the opinion of the multitudes who live 
in slums, and in closely pent-up streets, that 
constitutes knowledge. Rather it is the opinion 
of experts who live in highly natural, indeed in 
ideal, conditions, in or near cities. Few will 
follow Mr. Wentz if he means that all life in 
cities is unnatural, and all city folk abnormal. 
Man seems to be by nature a city-making animal, 
like the ant or the bee. The knowledge and 
control of the powers of nature upon which our 
civilization reposes have been initiated and car- 
ried forward by city men. Rather, one might 
say that to the city man belongs the knowledge 
of the world. Mr. Wentz's argument is based 
on a confusion of thought. If it proves anything 
it proves that all human knowledge is abnormal. 
Man is by nature naked and superstitious. 

The utility of Mr. Wentz's book for students 
of Celtic custom, ritual, and myth is consider- 
able. He has collected much information con- 
cerning the modern fairy beliefs of Celtic lands, 
and has conveniently catalogued it according to 
the locality where it was obtained. He fails, 
however, to call attention to many of the valu- 
able conclusions which his researches tend to 
establish. The persistence of Celtic popular tra- 
dition is one of these astonishing facts. Irishmen 
in Connemara to-day hold exactly the same be- 
liefs about the fairies as were recorded in Irish 
sagas of one thousand years ago. For example, 
the Togail Bruidne Da Derga, which was very 



likely written down in the eighth century, and 
is preserved in an MS. of about 1100, describes 
hostile fairies as appearing all red, even to their 
clothing, their hair, and their teeth, and riding 
upon red horses. These hostile fairies in red, 
slightly disguised as mysterious red knights, 
appear again and again in the Arthurian legends, 
which undoubtedly rest upon a basis of Celtic 
story. Mr. Wentz's informants in many differ- 
ent places in Ireland of to-day peasants, un- 
lettered men, wholly unfamiliar with ancient 
books described to him fairies who appeared 
all in red, even to their hair, and sometimes 
declared that they had seen the fairies as com- 
panies of little red men in red cloaks. 

The numerous facts of modern folk-lore which 
Mr. Wentz has collected, rather than his conclu- 
sions about them, constitute the real value of his 
book. Indeed, to any exacting reader, these 
folk-lore facts are by far the most interesting 
things which the book contains.

THE CONFLICT WITH CRIMINALITY.* 



It is curious to note in certain young admini- 
strators of the criminal law in America an irri- 
tability which makes them impatient of the 
careful and slow processes of education. The 
ancient retributive idea of justice was adapted to 
simple and savage minds, and required nothing 
but a club, a noose, and a dungeon. This primi- 
tive conception still casts its dark shadow over 
our courts and codes. The prosecuting attorney, 
the sheriff, and the policeman are eager to make 
quick work with the disagreeable offender, and 
" send him over the road " as soon as possible. 
They are not so much to blame, for they have 
legal traditions on their side, and are bred to 
prompt action. One trouble is, however, that 
this swift emotional reaction creates recidivists ; 
and the repeater returns after a brief cooling 
process to plague the courts and the public. In 
medical treatment of deep-seated disease a little 
time spent on diagnosis is not wasted. The edu- 
cator bases his methods on psychology, and, like

a careful husbandman, waits long years for his 
harvest. Criminal procedure usually aims to 
be just, and it often loses itself in technicalities 
which favor the criminal ; but at bottom our pro- 
cedure has no reformatory purpose or method : 
it remains under the spell of the retributive 
aim. 

As a corrective of this hasty and emotional 
attitude toward criminality, the studies of Dr. 
James Devon, physician in a Scotch prison, are 
welcome. His criticism of the legal legends and 
fictions is caustic, but justified by the facts cited 
from his long experience. It is amazing how 
this shrewd observer of men can see the weak- 
ness and wickedness of humanity so vividly and 
paint it so realistically, and yet retain his calm, 
patient, and loving attitude toward everyone 
except the privileged classes. While he does 
not mention the American methods of parole, 
probation, and indeterminate sentence, it is 
encouraging to us to find this Scottish doctor 
supporting our own contentions at every point. 

One moves into an entirely different atmo- 
sphere when passing from Dr. Devon's prison 
clinic and hospital ward to the scholarly pre- 
cincts of Harvard University and the philo- 
sophic speculations of Dr. Ray M. McConnell. 
The very title of the latter's book, " Criminal 
Responsibility and Social Constraint," smells of 
the lamp. Yet speculation has practical value, 
and compels us to go to the foundations of our 
legislation and our prison theories. We have 
need of profound reflection on the aims of pun- 
ishment, and ought to consider carefully what 
we are trying to accomplish. Is it expiation, 
or retribution, or deterrence, or reformation, or 
social utility, or an amalgam of all these ? It 
is profitable also to review our philosophical 
notions about fate, foreordination, and free will, 
and the exact nature of responsibility for crime. 
Toward all of these ends Dr. McConnell's book 
is an excellent means. 

From the purely scholastic debate about deter- 
minism and responsibility, we descend with some- 
thing of shock to the practical problem of prison 
labor. " Penal Servitude " is a pamphlet directed 
against the prison contractor, who here figures 
as a slave driver under state authority. The 
National Committee on Prison Labor is doing 
for this subject what the National Committee 
on Child Labor is doing for childhood exploited 
by factory, mill, and mine. A strain of human 
idealism runs through the sordid details of prison 
shops and disciplinary punishments, of venal 
foremen and spoils politics, of coarse brutality 
and purchase of raw materials. One could wish 



that the discussion might be more impersonal, 
for some prison contractors are honest men and 
the contract system is by no means condemned 
by all prison authorities. In his main conten- 
tion, however, the author of this attack is on the 
right side. The State should not delegate to 
private persons the process o^f correction and 
punishment, in which labor is a vital factor. The 
descriptions of conditions observed by the author 
are instructive, and should awaken the public 
conscience to correct these gross abuses. 

In order to make our system of dealing with 
criminals worthy of our modern civilization, 
thoughtful and educated men and women must 
give more attention to this forbidding theme. 
The Attorney General has asked Congress to 
prosecute an investigation of the whole subject, 
so far as the federal authority extends. We 
must strive to bring into the service a higher 
order of officials, and a more scientific and 
conscientious study of the human beings with 
whom they have to deal. The criminal world 
is not a world apart, but near our homes, and 
cannot be ignored as a theme unfit for the 
polite. The cost of crime is estimated by care- 
ful men to be over 1700,000,000 each year, 
and the fruits of this appalling expenditure are 
sorrow, debasement, cruelty, shame, and every 
form of evil. In urging the social duty of 
attention to criminality, the author of " The 
Present Day Problem of Crime " touches the 
more spiritual elements of the subject. In a 
citation from Mr. F. H. Wines, we have the 
central idea of prison reform the personality 
of the officials. "The head of a reformatory 
prison must be an idealist, a consecrated man, 
a man with a vocation. A truly reformatory 
prison is the last and highest expression of 
charity. It demands the expression of charity 
by the warden. It will not work in the hands 
of a harsh, brutal, incompetent warden. It 
needed the Christian heart and administrative 
genius of a Maconochie to devise and work 
out the reformatory method of treatment." 
What is true of wardens is true also of police, 
prosecutors, and judges: the modern educa- 
tional theory of the treatment of crime breaks 
down unless it is administered throughout by 
competent and high-minded men. That is not 
a reason for abandoning the modern view, but 
only for demanding the selection and training 
of a body of officials who understand it and are 
competent to carry it into effect. 

To students of prison science, the principles 
and methods worked out at Elmira Reformatory 
have long been familiar through the year-books,

essays, and addresses of its famous superintend- 
ent, as well as by discussions in various lan- 
guages by critical visitors. The autobiography 
of Mr. Brockway now published reproduces cer- 
tain classical documents which summarize his 
doctrines in various stages of development ; but 
the new factor here is the frank, clear story of 
the evolution of the great administrator's own 
mind. This new light is extremely welcome 
even to those who have already known him and 
studied his impersonal statements of views in 
numerous previous publications. 

The world is not even yet far enough advanced 
fully to sympathize with the fundamental eth- 
ical, legal, and administrative ideas which have 
made Elmira Reformatory the synonym of a 
revolution. Before he had reached his majority 
this innovator, sturdy son of a man of independ- 
ent spirit and New England conscience, entered 
upon his apprenticeship. He was fortunate in 
coming under the influence of the most famous 
prison wardens of the previous generation, from 
whom he learned much, but advanced steadily 
beyond them. Mr. Brockway was stimulated 
in his earlier work by a very intense, if some- 
what narrow, religious enthusiasm, from which 
he gradually turned away for what he regards 
as a more rational faith. In this respect, as in 
many others, he has been affected by the modes 
of thinking current in the last century, although 
he does not often indicate the literary sources 
of the new direction of thought. We have to 
do, not with a man of books so much as a man 
who felt himself in contact with reality and used 
the ideas of others in a very independent fash- 
ion, hardly noting whence they came to him. 
With the bare mention of Lombroso and the 
Irish prison reformers and a few others, he moves 
along quite unconscious of his literary obliga- 
tions. We know that he has read a good deal, 
but he seems to have most valued conversation 
and correspondence with the best men of prac- 
tical experience in his own profession. 

The one principle which guided him from 
beginning to end was that of social protection 
against criminals by their reformation or by 
their segregation. To secure these ends he tried 
all sorts of experiments with a sagacity, per- 
sistence, and patience which were crowned with 
growing success. He never gave up an ele- 
ment which he found in any degree useful. 
While he laid less emphasis on moral and reli- 
gious persuasion in later years, he never wholly 
abandoned them and always made use of them ; 
always trying to keep out sectarianism and 
fanaticism, from which he suffered more than 



once. He is liberal and honest to the extent 
that he reprints his earlier views, with an ex- 
planation of the changes in his own philosophy. 
His autobiography is the account of a growing 
mind. Down to the very last he is trying experi- 
ments and making observations ; for he still lives 
a noble intellectual life, with open mind and 
keen criticism of methods and systems. His 
enemies will be forgotten; but his work will 
remain, an honor to him and to his country.

When once another intention is admitted than the

maybe regarded as the text of Mr. Charles Whibley's 
" Studies in Frankness " (Dutton), a volume which 
embraces appreciations of eight authors popularly 
banned as immoral either in their lives or in their 
works. Modern English literature is represented by 
Sir Thomas Urquhart, Laurence Sterne, and Edgar 
Allan Poe ; the ancient classics by Petronius, Heli- 
odorus, Apuleius, Herondas, and Lucian. One won- 
ders what Poe is doing in this unholy gallery ; his 
works are -not likely to corrupt the youngest thing, 
and his life no longer biases people against his works. 
One might suppose from the sentences quoted above 
that the ordinary moral distinctions of life were to 
be completely disregarded in art, that the obscene 
could be transmuted into the artistic, were it not that 
elsewhere in the volume Sterne is condemned because 
he is " manifestly obscene in places," and obscenity, 
which in life is immoral, is in art " a matter of taste." 
Well, if the obscene is condemned in art, it makes 
very little difference whether it is called immoral or 
in bad taste ; we do not want it under any name. If 
Mr. Whibley regrets that the Milesian story is denied 
literary expression by our " ineradicable modesty " 
and is forced to " eke out a beggarly and formless 
existence by the aid of oral tradition," we cannot 
enter into any very vital sympathy with him. The 
" pleasure and delight " lost to the race may well be 
spared. Nor can one go off into gales of laughter, 
or be tickled, as one is by Chaucer at his naughtiest, 
when one reads the tid-bits selected from the " frank " 
dialogues of Herondas, unless one supposes that the 
asterisks are voluble of convulsive mirth. And why 
asterisks in a Study in Frankness? On the other 
hand, no one to-day will object to the picaresque 
novel, to the rascalities of the rogues and beggars,. 
" daggle-tailed and out-at- elbows," as they are, for 
instance, depicted in Petronius. As a matter of fact,, 
the purpose of art is not subjective, as Mr. Whibley 



198 



[Sept. 16, 



(following Aristotle) declares ; but it is, as Professor 
Butcher has already pointed out, objective. It is 
the " revelation of the beautiful in external form." 
If what our conventions stamp as immoral can reveal 
the beautiful, it has a place in art, and only so. Criti- 
cism will not condemn " Holy Willie's Prayer," what- 
ever the puritan may say ; but it will condemn the 
pruriences of Sterne and the unblushing license of 
Wycherley. Morality is more than convention ; and 
art, which is founded on life, cannot ignore that 
which penetrates all life. 

The story of More than three-quarters of a cen- 
a prophet and tury after his sombre and pathetic 
Jiis reward. passing from the scenes of his spec- 
tacular labors as a preacher of astonishing eloquence 
and power, Edward Irving is made the subject of 
as zealous a defense, of as glowing a eulogy, as any 
martyr to his faith could desire. "Edward Irving: 
Man, Preacher, Prophet," by Jean Christie Root, 
is written in an earnest endeavor to rescue from 
threatening oblivion the name of one who, the author 
finds reason to believe, "perhaps more clearly fore- 
shadowed the problems and truths of to-day than 
any other one man in his period." By "problems 
and truths " must be understood those of a spiritual 
and religious nature; and the trial and condemna- 
tion of Irving for heresy do indeed stamp him, to 
our view, as a thinker in advance of his age in that 
liberality which comes with freedom from the fet- 
ters of tradition and convention. The writer has 
evidently long cherished the purpose of presenting 
the world with a true picture of Irving, and she has 
amassed much valuable material for such an under- 
taking. All the contemporary and other published 
writings that throw light on his character and work 
she has faithfully studied, and she has also had the 
use of the large store of unpublished material gath- 
ered together by the late Rev. W. W. Andrews, who 
had made the acquaintance of some of Irving's asso- 
ciates and seems to have enjoyed exceptional oppor- 
tunities for learning the details of his later life. Yet 
the book now offered is not the exhaustive biography 
that might have been expected ; but as we already 
have Mrs. Oliphant's substantial performance, this 
briefer essay in character-study and interpretation 
may better meet the present need. What is espe- 
cially excellent, in it is its plea for charity and sym- 
pathy in judging those enthusiasms and ardors of 
Irving's that his own contemporaries were prone to 
condemn. His views on the human qualities of 
Jesus, his faith in the testimony of the "inner 
voice," his belief in something akin to our modern 
psychotherapy, were all in advance of his day and 
generation. At the same time he conspicuously 
lacked balance, he had no saving sense of humor, 
and he laid himself open to imposture from any 
charlatan that pretended to divine inspiration. This 
weaker side of the man his apologist does not turn 
to the light. The book does an incidental service in 
rightly presenting Irving's relations to the Carlyles, 
and in asserting, with documentary evidence, the 



happiness of his marriage. A portrait of Irving 
and brief "appreciations" of him from Coleridge, 
Carlyle, Maurice, and other contemporaries, are 
supplied. (Sherman, French & Co.) 

A risoner Much has been written about the 
of war in unspeakable condition of the various 

Virginia. Confederate prisons in which so many 

northern soldiers endured sufferings too cruel to bear 
description. Richmond, Danville, and Salisbury 
were the scenes of notoriously heartless treatment of 
the unlucky captives. Not to dwell on this harsher 
side of prison life, but "to recall certain of the inci- 
dents which helped to enliven the tedious days and 
nights of confinement," is the purpose of Mr. George 
Haven Putnam's personal record entitled " A Pris- 
oner of War in Virginia, 1864-5 " (Putnam). It 
is probably not generally known that this publisher 
and author, besides having won with his pen the title 
of Doctor of Letters, much earlier earned with his 
sword that of Adjutant and Brevet-Major, and that 
it was his lot to suffer four months' confinement in 
Libby Prison and at Danville. The narrative of the 
less harrowing part of this trying experience was 
presented in a paper read before the New York 
Commandery of the United States Loyal Legion, in 
December, 1910. It attracted attention, and is now 
expanded sufficiently to make a book of a little more 
than a hundred pages, adorned with an interesting 
portrait of the soldier-author in his uniform, with a 
sketch of the interior of the Union officers' prison at 
Danville drawn by the author's chum, Captain Harry 
Vander Weyde, and with other appropriate illustra- 
tions. With something of the realism of a Dostoieff- 
sky, but with a lighter touch and with an emphasis 
on the more entertaining or amusing features of his 
prison life, the author has produced a book that few 
will open without feeling moved to read from begin- 
ning to end. The question of ultimate responsi- 
bility for the mismanagement of southern military 
prisons and for the long delays in effecting exchanges 
of prisoners is instructively discussed. 

The instinct for etymologizing is 

Thewav* we ll-nigh universal. The etymolo- 

of words. . ' 

gist, however, has not always borne 

the best of reputations. In his pronouncements he 
has not invariably been guided by commonsense and 
a sound linguistic feeling. Dr. Johnson, for instance, 
was naive enough to derive the adverb along, in the 
collocation "Come along," from French Allans; 
and Bishop Trench blandly connected the word 
saunterer with the Crusading expeditions to the 
Holy Land, deriving the word from the French 
la Sainte Terre. But within the last half-century 
English etymology has finally been put on a scien- 
tific basis ; and in recent years some most excellent 
books on the subject have appeared. The latest 
addition to this list is Professor Ernest Weekley's 
"The Romance of Words" (Dutton). Professor 
Weekley writes mainly of English words, but he 
shows his bias to his own field as teacher by the 



1912.] 



THE DIAL 



199 



large number of Romance etymologies that he 
introduces. He is concerned only incidentally with 
the exposition of general principles, but avows as his 
chief purpose the presentation of the "unexpected 
in etymology, 'things not generally known,' such as 
the fact that Tammany was an Indian chief, . . . 
that jilt is identical with Juliet, that parrot is 
historically a diminutive of Peter, and that glamor 
is a doublet of grammar." He makes little at- 
tempt to exploit new theories, contenting himself, 
for the most part, with "compiling" his materials 
(as he modestly states it in his preface) from other 
sources, mainly the "New English Dictionary" 
with which he has been associated for a number 
of years in the verification of etymologies. Among 
the dozen or more words for which he proposes new 
etymologies are cockney (generally supposed to be 
compounded of cock and egg}, which he would now 
trace to French acoguine ("made into a coquin"); 
mulligrubs, which he derives from mouldy grubs ; 
foil (for fencing), which he connects with feuille ; 
and sullen, which he holds to be a doublet of solemn. 
An extremely interesting chapter is the final one, 
entitled "Etymological Fact and Fiction," in which 
the author brings together a collection of anecdotes 
from the .earlier lexicographers, and lays sundry ety- 
mological ghosts. Throughout, Professor Weekley 
writes with admirable downrightness and simplicity, 
and he nowhere displays anything of cocksureness 
or of pedantry the besetting sins of the etymol- 
ogist. His book is, first of all, scholarly ; but it is 
also thoroughly entertaining. 

The undying The " S P eli Series 'J (Page) reaches 
charm of its fourth number in " The Spell of 

old England. England," by Mrs. Daniel Dulany 
Addison (or Julia de Wolf Addison, as the name 
appears on the title-page). Mrs. Addison lived in 
England as a child, and studied art there later, so 
that she writes with much more than the summer 
tourist's acquaintance with the country. In seven- 
teen chapters, agreeably conversational and anec- 
dotal in style, she takes her readers through England 
from end to end and from side to side. That the 
" spell " is not so unremitting and so powerful as to 
hush the traveller's criticism and deaden all sense of 
humor is evident from many an entertaining passage 
like the following : " One might almost write a whole 
chapter on the signs and advertisements which one 
meets in English travel. A terrible possibility is 
suggested by the announcement: 'Old false teeth 
bought and sold,' while 'The Superfine Cotton Spin- 
ner's Combine Limited ' is almost as difficult to say 
five times as ' Peter Piper.' On a shop in London 
one reads ' Greaves late Huggins.' This is a sermon 
in itself." A good index and two pages of bibli- 
ography add to the usefulness of the book, while a 
map marked with the places visited enables one to 
follow the itinerary understandingly. "Tavistock," 
misprinted "Travistock" on the map, is placed, not 
in Devonshire, but too far to the west, in Cornwall 
a part of England, by the way, to which many 



readers would doubtless feel inclined to give consid- 
erably more time than Mrs. Addison has given, less 
than two pages being devoted to it in her book. Also 
the Lake District might fairly claim more than the 
dozen pages allotted to it. But England is crowded 
with places of interest, and to do them all justice 
would take a lifetime. The book's numerous illus- 
trations from photographs of buildings, interiors, 
landscapes, and paintings, are excellent. 



Records of two Mr - Richard Davey, whose death 
Elizabethan has recently been chronicled, was a 
princesses. writer of more than usual breadth: 

his field embraced journalism, history, travel, and 
other sections not so easily classified. As historian 
he is best known as the biographer of Lady Jane 
Grey, "the nine days' queen." The last years of his 
life were devoted to a continuation of his studies in 
the history of the Brandon line, the results of which 
have lately been published under the title "The 
Sisters of Lady Jane Grey and their Wicked Grand- 
father" (Dutton). The Greys were the legal heirs 
to the English throne after Elizabeth; but as they 
never came into the inheritance, their history has 
been neglected by earlier historians. Mr. Davey's 
work traces the career of the two Grey sisters, 
Catherine and Mary, with the chief attention given 
to Catherine as the older and more important ; Mary 
was a dwarf and scarcely had what may be called a 
" career," except during her brief marriage to a giant 
who held a subordinate office at the royal palace. 
As heir presumptive in a period of much ferment, 
Lady Catherine naturally found herself in the centre 
of a network of intrigue, as both Catholics and Pro- 
testants looked with favor on her as a candidate for 
the throne if Elizabeth should be displaced. The 
author gives some attention to this phase of his biog- 
raphy, and throws considerable light on the anti- 
Elizabethan movements in the early years of the 
reign ; but by far the greater portion of the work is 
devoted to the love affairs of these indiscreet prin- 
cesses, and Mr. Davey narrates much gossip that is 
of slight importance, though usually entertaining. 
The portraits which illustrate the volume are very 
interesting; they are chiefly of members of the 
Tudor family, but several are from paintings that 
are not generally known. 

social conditions The analysis of community life has 
in a New England been developed far enough to make 
factory town. i oca ] studies more complete and 
instructive than ever before. The latest of such stu- 
dies is Mr George F. Kenngott's "The Record of 
a City : A Social Survey of Lowell, Massachusetts " 
(Macmillan). Lowell is a fine example of the tend- 
encies of industrial populations in this country, and it 
is old enough to reveal contrasts between the present 
and the past. One must be a stout-hearted optimist 
to contemplate serenely a comparison between the 
Lowell of Lucy Larcom and the "Lowell Offering" 
with the noisy and polyglot town of to-day. It is a 
different stock, with distinctly lower standards and

ideals. If this is what industry and immigrant labor 
are going to make of American people, then success- 
ful manufactures are a national calamity. But we 
have not seen the end, and even in this chaos one 
may discern the dawn of a more hopeful day. It 
is well to read Miss Mary Antin's "The Promised 
Land" as a relief from the depressing effects of 
such a picture. If we can react upon this mountain- 
mass of alien material, we may help to save the 
world; if we are apathetic and passive we shall cer- 
tainly lose our civilization. The following quotation 
from the poet Lowell fittingly closes this rather dole- 
ful description of a factory town: 

" 'Ti8 ours to save our brethren, 
With love and peace to win 
Their darkened hearts from error 
Ere they harden into sin. 
But if, before his duty, 
Man with listless spirit stands, 
Ere long the Great Avenger 
Takes the work from out his hands." 

It is significant that this study was inspired and 
directed by such men as Professor Peabody of Har- 
vard. The history of the town from Colonial days 
introduces a mass of well-arranged facts, collected 
with vast toil, about the present population, the hous- 
ing of the operatives, health conditions, the standard 
of living, industrial conditions, social institutions, 
and recreations of the people. The reader should 
be reminded that the budget included is based on 
only one week's experience, while it is now generally 
agreed that the accounts should cover at least a 
whole year. The better method, however, is so ex- 
pensive that private investigators cannot use it for an 
entire city, and we should be grateful for the study 
as it stands. Those to whom statistics are an un- 
known language may look at the pictures in this vol- 
ume, some of which are pathetic even to tragedy.

brother's chapters describing them, or, as the 
brother modestly intimates, the descriptive matter 
was furnished as complementary to the illustrations, 
the book, " Famous Houses and Literary Shrines of 
London" (Button), which Mr. A. St. John Adcock 
and Mr. Frederick Adcock have together brought 
to completion, is well planned and does credit to all 
concerned in its making. Seventy-four houses and 
other literary landmarks of London, covering the 
three centuries from Shakespeare's time to 
Whistler's, are gracefully drawn by the artist, 
while his collaborator turns to good account the 
abundant memoirs and other literature throwing 
light on the inmates of these houses and the 
haunters of these scenes. Not as a mere compiler, 
however, has Mr. St. John Adcock been content to 
perform his part. A wide knowledge of London 
and an intimate acquaintance with the literature 
relating to its memorable buildings are apparent in 
his pages. Even our own Hawthorne and his visit 
to Leigh Hunt in Rowan Road find a place in the 



book; and the noteworthy researches of our Pro- 
fessor Wallace in fixing Shakespeare's temporary 
abode with one Christopher Mountjoy, wig-maker, 
at the corner of Silver and Monkwell streets, do not 
escape his generously appreciative notice. Some- 
what surprising to most readers will be the number 
and importance of the extant monuments of bygone 
ages scattered about London. Much that is his- 
toric has vanished, but much still survives; and a 
more attractive or useful guide to these cherished 
mementos of a day that is dead could hardly be 
desired. Sixteen portraits, beginning with Dr. 
Johnson's and ending with Robert Browning's, add 
to the pictorial richness of the volume. 



A noblewoman Mrs - Maxwell Scott's Life of the 
of the French Marquise de la Rochejaquelin (Long- 
Revoiution. mans) is based mainly upon Mme. de 
la Rochejaquelin's Memoirs, an English translation 
of which appeared as long ago as 1827, with a pre- 
face by Sir Walter Scott. Mrs. Scott has drawn 
also upon the Souvenirs of Mme. de la Bouere, 
another Vendean heroine. In point of view the 
treatment is unreservedly sympathetic toward these 
defenders of the throne and altar ; not merely toward 
the women, who were undoubtedly heroic, and the 
peasants and their leaders, who were equally so, but 
towards the cause. The Vendean revolt and its ruth- 
less suppression make up one of the most tragic in- 
cidents of the Revolution, but wrong was not wholly 
on the side of the " Blues," as the Republicans were 
called, although the list of their atrocities is longer. 
The absence of shading mars Mrs. Scott's narrative ; 
and the characters, which are all courage and virtue 
and self-sacrifice, give it too much the tone of a work 
of edification. The element of contrast might have 
been furnished by one personage, to whom she alludes 
as a mystery, but whose secret has been revealed in 
one of M. Len6tre's incomparable essays. This is 
the masquerading Bishop of Agra, who gave himself 
out as direct representative of the Pope and was ac- 
cepted as such by the Vendean chiefs. The comedy 
ended in tragedy, and the motive (at least in the 
beginning) seems to have been the simple one of 
trying to extricate himself from the danger of being 
shot. .

vivacious and informally descriptive and narrative, 
as well as rapturous, are addressed chiefly to either 
" M " or " G," but occasionally to other members of 
the alphabet ; and their writer, we are told, is " an 
American girl." She shows a quick responsiveness 
to all that is striking or characteristic or otherwise 
interesting in the strange sights that greet her Amer- 
ican eyes. Incidentally, too, her book derives abun- 
dant "local color" from the innumerable native 
words and phrases that it contains for the instruc- 
tion or the bewilderment of its readers. In fact, we 
have failed to find a single page unsprinkled with 
foreign terms. But a little more care to have these 
exotic gems free from flaw would have been advis- 
able. A couplet quoted in the third letter as " Tutto 
al mondo e vano Ne Vamore agni dolcezza," has 
enough errors to startle even a careless reader. 
Nevertheless, one is moved to envy this American 
girl for her ecstatic winter on the Bay of Naples. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Two of the late William James's student talks, " On 
a Certain Blindness in Human Beings " and " What 
Makes a Life Significant," have been reprinted by 
Messrs. Holt in a little volume entitled " On Some of 
Life's Ideals." These essays are among the most stim- 
ulating and helpful of the author's ethical writings, and 
in the present inexpensive form it is to be hoped that 
they will find the widest possible audience. 

Volume Six of the " Bibliographical Society of Amer- 
ica Papers," published by the University of Chicago 
Press, is made up of three noteworthy articles : " Father 
Kino's Lost History, its Discovery, and its Value," by 
Mr. Herbert E. Bolton; "A Bibliography of English 
Fiction in the Eighteenth Century," by Mr. John M. 
Clapp; and "The New Classification of Languages and 
Literatures by the Library of Congress," by Mr. A. C. 
von Noe*. There is in all these papers a freshness of 
interest not always to be found in the publications of 
bibliographical societies. 

The latest addition to Mr. Henry Frowde's admirable 
series of inexpensive reprints known as the " World's 
Classics " is "A Book of English Essays (1600-1900)," 
selected by Messrs. Stanley V. Makower and Basil W. 
Blackwell. Here are brought together more than fifty 
brief essays, from some forty different essayists, rang- 
ing from Sir Thomas Overbury to Francis Thompson. 
The choice of items is abundantly varied, each of the 
several types of essay (the informal, the didactic, the 
critical, and the like) being fully represented, and is in 
other respects judicious. 

" The Village Homes of England " is the subject of 
the latest special number of " The International Studio " 
(Lane). These " haunts of ancient peace," in which En- 
gland is so rich, are here dealt with as examples of archi- 
tecture rather than as records or symbols of the past. 
Mr. Sydney H. Jones, who is responsible for the text, 
supplies also a multitude of pen-and-ink and color illus- 
trations; a few additional drawings in color are con- 
tributed by Messrs. Wilfrid Ball and John Fullwood. 
The work as a whole forms a competent and interesting 
treatment of a fascinating subject; while in all external 
details the volume measures up to the notably high 
standard set by previous " Studio " special numbers. 



.NOTES. 



A new novel by Mr. Henry Sydnor Harrison, the au- 
thor of " Queed," is announced for publication in Janu- 
ary by Houghton Mifflin Co. 

A life of Canute the Great, by Professor Laurence 
M. Larson, will be added shortly to Messrs. Putnam's 
" Heroes of the Nations" series. 

" The Oxford Book of Victorian Verse," compiled by 
Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch, is an autumn announcement 
of no little interest to poetry-lovers. 

An English publication of considerable importance, 
not yet announced on this side, is a biography of the 
late George Frederick Watts, written by his widow, to 
be issued in three large illustrated volumes. 

Although nearly a decade has passed since his death, 
no biography of William Ernest Henley has yet appeared. 
We are glad to note that we are soon to have such a 
work, from the pen of Mr. Charles Whibley. 

Mr. Gordon Craig, author of " On the Art of the 
Theatre," will soon publish a quarto volume of drawings 
for scenic settings, with brief descriptive text. The 
book will be entitled " Towards a New Theatre." 

An anthology of "Masterpieces of the Southern 
Poets," compiled by Mr. Walter Neale, is announced 
by the Neale Publishing Co. This house will also pub- 
lish the " Poetical Works of Rose Hartwick Thorpe." 

Publication of the late Professor Ernest Fenollosa's 
" Epochs of Chinese and Japanese Art," which was post- 
poned from last autumn, will take place this month. It 
will comprise two elaborately-illustrated quarto volumes. 

A complete single-volume edition of George Mere- 
dith's poetical works, based on the carefully-revised text 
of the recent " Memorial Edition," and supplied with 
notes by Mr. G. M. Trevelyan, will be published next 
month by Messrs. Scribner. 

The series of papers entitled " Among My Books," 
with which Mr. Frederic Harrison has been delighting 
readers of " The English Review " during the past few 
months, will be published in book form, with some 
additional reviews and essays, by the Mactnillan Co. 

That Louis Napoleon was the natural son of Napoleon 
I. is the thesis set forth in a two-volume work entitled 
" Intimate Memoirs of Napoleon III.," translated from 
the private diary of a lifelong and intimate friend of 
Louis Napoleon, the late Baron D'Ambes, which Messrs. 
Little, Brown, & Co. will immediately publish in this 
country. 

A belated recognition of Coleridge, in the form of a 
definitive edition of his poems and plays in two volumes, 
is soon to appear from the Oxford University Press. 
Mr. Ernest Hartley Coleridge, grandson of the poet- 
philosopher, is the compiler and editor of this first com- 
plete edition of the writings that have been waiting a 
century (more or less) for collection and publication in 
fitting form. 

A few additional announcements of Messrs. G. P. 
Putnam's Sons which reached us too late for inclusion 
in the regular list of autumn announcements in this issue 
are the following: "The Diaries of William Charles 
Macready, 1833-1851," edited by Mr. William Charles 
Toynbee; " Indian Pages and Pictures," by Mr. Michael 
M. Shoemaker; "Greek and Roman Portraits," an art 
study by Dr. Anton Hekler; and " De Orbe Novo: The 
Eight Decades of Peter Martyr D'Anghiera," translated 
from the Latin and edited by Mr. Francis Augustus 
MacNutt.

ANNOUNCEMENT LIST OF FALL, BOOKS. 

In accordance with our custom of many years' 
standing, we place before our readers herewith a 
carefully-prepared classified list of the new books 
announced for issue during the Fall and Winter of 
1912-13 by the leading American publishing houses. 
Including the two departments of "School and 
College Text- books" and '-Books for the Young," 
which considerations of space compel us to carry over 
to our next issue, our list of Fall announcements 
this year comprises over two thousand titles, repre- 
senting the output of some sixty American publish- 
ers. This list has as usual been prepared especially 
for our pages, from the most authentic information 
to be obtained; and its interest and value to every 
bookbuy er whether librarian, bookseller, or private 
purchaser will be at once apparent. All the books 
entered are new books new editions not being in- 
cluded unless having new form or matter. Some of 
the more interesting features among these announce- 
ments are commented upon in the leading editorial 
in this number of THE DIAL.

Woman in Modern Society 

By EARL BARNES 

At one time Professor of European History in the 

State University of Indiana, and later 

Professor of Education in Leland 

Stanford Junior University. 
Author of " Where Knowledge Fails." 



THOSE who fear woman's devotion to work outside the home, 
her monopoly of education and her full participation in all 
the activities of men will find their fears formulated and clearly 
stated in this book. Those who are eager to see women pass on 
to full partnership with men will be deeply encouraged as they 
read these pages. Those who look upon this as a transition 
time, and long to get through it, that the energies of both men 
and women may be set free to work out a new society where the 
complementary values of both sexes will be preserved and used 
to their utmost, will welcome this book as a wise guide in 
troubled times.

The Panama Canal 

The San Francisco Exposition 

The interest in these events will continue to increase throughout the world until after 1914, 
when the Canal will be in operation, and until after 1915, the time appointed for the Exposition. 
Every intelligent person will want to know more of these occurrences, will want all the reliable 
information obtainable concerning them, causes and effects, economic and ethnic significance, 
evolving opportunities, and the enlargement of wealth and potentialities attending the opening 
of this last New World to civilization. 

It is not too much to claim that more than elsewhere of this requisite information, much 
of it new and all interesting, all ably and clearly presented, may be found in the two books

IMPORTANT NEW BOOKS 

AMERICAN POEMS 

Selected and edited, with illustrative and explanatory notes and bibliographies, by WALTER C. BRONSON, Professor of English 

Literature, Brown University. 

The book offers a most carefully chosen and well-balanced presentation of the poetic works of Americans, covering the entire 
period of our history. For the teacher as well as the student the value of the work is greatly enhanced by the comprehensive 
Notes, Bibliography, Glossary, and Index. It is believed that the book will have the wide popularity of Mr. Bronson's earlier col- 
lection, English Poems, which has been adopted by all leading American colleges. 680 pages, 12mo, cloth, postpaid $1.68.

By ANDREW C. McLAUGHLIN, Professor of History in the University of Chicago. 

The work consists of five papers, the first of which discusses the power of a court to declare a law unconstitutional. Two deal 
with the growth and essential character of political parties, and are followed by one of the history of differing theories of the 
federal Union. The work fittingly concludes with a discussion of the written constitution in some of its historical aspects.

"To the student of popular movements, 
these volumes will prove invaluable." Chi- 
cago Evening Post.

sive. The author, by allowing the actors to 
speak, as far as possible, in their own words, pre-

CLASSICAL R UBBISH. 

The official bulletin of the Newark Public 
Library devotes a page of its current issue to 
the " great books " superstition. The homily 
opens as follows : 

" Much literary talk is mere pretense. We learn in 
school days who the great writers are, according to the 
critics and the text-books, and we learn a few phrases 
about them, and perhaps, because the course prescribes 
it, we read a few pages of them. When we get out of 
school or college, do we read them any more ? Very 
few of us do. If it strikes our fancy to have a library 
we buy these great books and put them on its shelves, 
and look at them with pride, and often with a little 
guilty feeling. We think we ought to read them." 

Now with all this we have no quarrel. It is 
plain truth, given a somewhat philistine accent 
in the expression. When boys and girls leave 
school, most of them turn their backs upon lit- 
erature, and will have none of it. This deplor- 
able fact is, we are persuaded, a consequence of 
the way in which pedantic pedagogues use works 
of literature as educational appliances. But the 
fact is none the less deplorable, and it behooves 
those who have to do with educational work to 
remedy the conditions which bring about such 
a result. Our librarian mentor goes on to say 
(and here we most emphatically part company 
with him) "We are quite mistaken we ought 
not to read them if we do not really like them." 
Which is to say : We ought not to be virtuous 
if our natural inclinations are sinful, or we ought 
not to be sober if we get more satisfaction from 
being drunk. For there undoubtedly is such a 
thing as good taste in reading, and if we have 
not acquired it we should confess the defect in 
a humble spirit, and not resort to blustering 
denial after the fashion of the philistines in all 
ages. 

Humility, not hypocrisy, is what we need to 
practice in such a case. For a man to pretend 
to like books that in reality bore him unspeak- 
ably is a grievous fault, but to assert that be- 
cause they bore him they cannot be worth his 
attention is mere childish petulance. We remem- 
ber the time when we were profoundly convinced 
that all this talk about the beauty of Shake- 
speare and Tennyson was sheer humbug, and 
scornfully rejected it as something not to be 
taken seriously. But that was at the age of 
twelve or thereabouts, and when the awakening 



230 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



came, it bad all the fervor of a religious conver- 
sion. Speaking of the world's great books, our 
bulletin further remarks : " One may dare to 
say that save for the very, very few who care for 
that kind of book, they are not worth the read- 
ing." From a child, this utterance would be 
merely amusing, but from an educational organ 
which speaks for that great agency of culture, 
the public library, it is simply shocking. If 
there is any purpose for which public libraries 
exist, and which in any way justifies them as a 
charge upon the public funds, it is that of in- 
creasing the number of " the very, very few who 
care for that kind of book," and of opening the 
minds of the many who view good literature from 
the seat of the scornful. To encourage them in 
their benighted self-sufficiency is nothing less 
than a crime against culture, and it is atrocious 
for such encouragement to come from an educa- 
tional agency which is under bonds to be uplift- 
ing in its influence. 

According to the counsel of iniquity which 
has occasioned these reflections, "the great, 
vital, fundamental, universal books of light and 
power . . . have, most of them, a message only 
for a very small circle," which would seem to 
be a paradox quite incapable of solution. The 
adjectives used in this characterization must be 
taken ironically to give the statement even a 
semblance of truth. For if books are in very 
truth vital, fundamental, and universal, they 
must have a message for every intelligent human 
being, and it is at his own serious cost that any 
individual will close his ears to the message, or 
refrain from the effort to decipher it. "He 
that is filthy, let him be filthy still " is a scrip- 
ture that would seem to apply in his case, 
and the worst service that could be done him 
would be to persuade him that the message 
was not meant for his hearing. To argue 
thus is to say, in effect, that no aspirations 
and idealisms are worth while, that souls sunk 
in the slough should make no uncomfortable 
effort to rise out of it, that the circumscribed 
vision is well enough, and the gleam of glories 
beyond is a delusion. One cannot too often 
recall Ruskin's indignant repudiation of the 
debased gospel of culture which preaches that 
the best literature is too bright and good for 
human nature's daily food. " Will you go and 
gossip with your housemaid, or your stable-boy, 
when you may talk with kings and queens ; or 
flatter yourself that it is with any worthy con- 
sciousness of your own claims to respect, that 
you jostle with the hungry and common crowd 
for entree here, and audience there, when all 



the while this eternal court is open to you, with 
its society, wide as the world, multitudinous as 
its days, the chosen, and the mighty, of every 
place and time?" 

That there may be no misunderstanding as to 
the nature of the advice offered by the Newark 
Library to its patrons, we are given a list of the 
books against which readers are warned as un- 
profitable. This list includes most of the works 
in which genius has attained its highest reach, 
and which have most profoundly moved the souls 
of men. The "Iliad," the "Odyssey" and the 
"^Eneid" are here, as are also "The Divine 
Comedy," "Paradise Lost," "Don Quixote," 
and "Faust." ^schylus and Euripides are 
placed on the Index, although for some un- 
accountable reason Sophocles and Aristophanes 
escape condemnation. Aristotle and Plato are, 
of course, marked for slaughter, as are also 
Cicero, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius. The 
secondary classics of English literature are 
mostly under the ban, including "The Canter- 
bury Tales," "The Faerie Queene," "The Pil- 
grim's Progress," the " Morte d' Arthur," " Tris- 
tram Shandy," Burke's speeches, and Gibbon's 
"Decline and Fall." Addison, Lamb, and 
Montaigne are essayists who have no message 
for the many, and even the "Imitation" is not 
spared. Mill's "Political Economy" appears 
here in bad eminence, evidently as a type of all the 
great works that have clarified human thought 
and advanced the intellectual life. We only 
wonder that the list (of some thirty great names) 
was not made much longer, for it does not come 
anywhere near to exhausting the chief literary 
sources of spiritual refreshment. It does, how- 
ever, guard the unwary reader against the errors 
into which he is most likely to fall, and assures 
him that most of what he has been taught about 
literature, either in school or by the masters of 
criticism, is unworthy of credence. Of course 
this sort of counsel is a most damnable perversion 
of the function of a public library, which, while it 
must recognize the deplorable fact that the best 
books are not called for nearly as often as the 
worst ones, should nevertheless bend its main 
energies to the redress of this bad balance, and 
should take more satisfaction in the one borrower 
who asks for Homer or Dante, for "Don Quixote" 
or "Faust," than in the ninety and nine who swell 
the statistics of circulation by bearing homeward 
the latest puerility of the latest popular novelist. 
It is difficult to have patience with the argument 
that neglect of a classic offers prim a facie evi- 
dence that tradition has overrated it. When the 
best minds of many generations are unanimous

THE D1A1

in delaring the supreme excellence of a book, it 
is no counsel of perfection to recommend it to the 
attention of the most casual reader as a source, 
for him personally, of rich spiritual sustenance. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



A NOTABLE BIBLIOGRAPHY, now in preparation 
by Professor John M. Clapp, is to be devoted to 
English prose fiction of the eighteenth century, 
and is expected to contain when completed between 
five thousand and fifty-five hundred titles. The 
laborious but not uninteresting task was begun by 
Mr. Clapp eight years ago, and has been prosecuted 
chiefly at the British Museum, whose catalogue 
must be the chief dependence of anyone engaged 
in such an undertaking as this. An account of his 
labors was read by Mr. Clapp at the late annual 
meeting of the Chicago Chapter of the Bibliograph- 
ical Society of America, and is printed in volume 
six of that Society's "Papers." To give an idea of 
the scope and method of his work, we quote a 
passage from his instructive and readable article. 
"To be really useful such a work must list not only 
the books which we should to-day classify as Novels 
or Short Stories (of these, according to my own 
list, there were between 2000 and 3000), but also 
as many as possible of the great number of other 
works whose appeal was chiefly, or largely, that of 
fiction. These may be grouped, roughly, in four 
classes : First, the narrative Chap-books. Second, 
the works of Pseudo-History, Pseudo-Biography, 
and Pseudo-Travel, of which there were many, 
especially in the first half of the century. In this 
class would be included the longer Criminal Bio- 
graphies. Third, the stream of Tracts and Pam- 
phlets, cast into narrative form, discussing current 
questions political, social, religious, educational, 
or personal in a persuasive, polemic, or satirical 
way. These also were very numerous, particularly 
at the beginning and the end of the century. 
Fourth, various miscellaneous works: Jest-books; 
' Miscellanies ' so called, made up of both expository 
and narrative matter ; certain collections of Essays, 
like those of Tom Brown, or Letters, like Mrs. 
Elizabeth Rowe's Friendship in Death, in which 
there is a considerable narrative element; and a few 
odds and ends." It is clear, as Mr. Clapp points out, 
that no one bibliographer can cover the whole field 
of English fiction in this systematic and painstaking 
manner. There is room enough for many workers, 
and even in the task that he has set himself, one 
would think him in need of helpers. 


THE LAST LABORS OF A VETERAN LITERARY 

WORKER, who has stuck to his task for more than 
forty years and then died pen in hand, figuratively 
speaking, are likely soon to see the light in posthu- 
mous publication. It appears from a communica- 
tion of Mr. Samuel C. Chew, Jr., lately printed in 



the New York "Evening Post," that the late Dr. 
Furness's closing years of Shakespeare editorship 
had brought almost to completion a fifteenth play in 
the series whose beginning dates back to 1871. In 
a letter written to Mr. Chew only a few days before 
his death, Dr. Furness said, after referring to the 
loss of several dear friends: "My nepenthe, how- 
ever, is work, into which it is impossible at eighty 
to throw as much energy as at thirty. If all goes 
well I hope to deliver ' Cymbeline ' to the mercies 
of the printers in a month or two. And then I 
shall rest and patch up my old body for heaven." 
As six years have elapsed since the "Antony and 
Cleopatra" was delivered to the mercies above 
named an interval only equalled, in the history 
of this Variorum edition, by that between "King 
Lear" and "Othello" there is reason to hope the 
"Cymbeline" may indeed be practically ready for 
publication, and that its early appearance may be 
counted on. Further quotation from the editor's 
correspondence claims a place here. Mr. Chew 
communicates this passage from an earlier letter: 
"To know that fresh, young, enthusiastic spirits are 
entering the world of Shakespeare, wherein there 
lies for them illimitable growth, cannot but fill with 
measureless content one who is finishing the journey, 
and to whom that world is fast vanishing in the 
lengthening shadows." In referring to the Baconian 
theory, which he said was almost as prevalent as 
the measles, and from which most people recovered 
as soon, Dr. Furness is quoted as demanding with 
mock indignation that the Baconians should read 
the essay "Of Gardens "and then follow it with the 
fourth act of "The Winter's Tale," or read the 
essay "Of Love" and then the third act of "Romeo 
and Juliet." "If they still believe," said he, "that 
the man who wrote the essays wrote those scenes, I 
give them up ! " 

DETAILS OF HARVARD'S PROMISED LIBRARY, the 
magnificent gift of Mrs. George D. Widener, mother 
of the late Harry Elkins Widener, to whose memory 
the building is to be dedicated, have now been made 
public, and indicate that the new structure will take 
rank with the world's largest and finest library 
buildings. Exceeding in dimensions the great 
Boston Public Library, it will almost equal the 
New York Public Library, and will have a capacity 
of nearly two and one- half million volumes, with 
fifty-nine miles of shelving to hold them. Its main 
reading-room, seating 375 persons, will be larger 
than the famous Bates Hall of the Boston library, 
while there will be no fewer than eighty special or 
private reading-rooms for Harvard professors and 
other scholars desiring seclusion of this sort. Also 
350 still smaller studies will be provided, so that 
no reasonable request for privacy in one's literary 
labors need be refused. The Widener Memorial 
Hall, on the first floor, will be a chief feature of the 
interior, and will be a room forty by thirty-two feet 
in measurement, with stack-room in the rear for the 
Widener collection. The dimensions of the building 



232 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



as a whole are given as 206 by 275 feet; the mate- 
rial will be brick and limestone, and the construction 
will be fire-proof throughout. Gore Hall, the home, 
since 1841, of America's fourth-largest library, will 
be torn down to make room, in part, for the incom- 
parably more commodious new quarters; and until 
the expected completion of the memorial building, 
in about two years, the books will be stored chiefly 
in Randall Hall, where also the card-catalogue will 
be placed, while reading-room accommodations will 
be provided in Massachusetts Hall. It is hoped 
that the dedication of the world's finest university 
library building may take place in the commence- 
ment week of 1914. 

THE APPEAL OF THE LITERARY WEEKLY to 

popular favor has been as successful with our 
English cousins as it has been the contrary with 
us. London hebdomadal publications devoted more 
or less conspicuously to the interests of literature 
are numerous and of no mean order of merit. 
That so many periodicals like the "Nation," 
"Athenaeum," "Academy," "Spectator," "Satur- 
day Review," and "Speaker" should flourish side 
by side, while in this country hardly more than one 
or two weekly publications of like character can be 
found even by the most kindly-disposed scrutiny, is 
rather remarkable. And what is more, the English 
list is now to be lengthened by a notable addition 
at the hands of the enterprising house of Messrs. 
J. M. Dent & Sons. On the eighteenth of October 
there will appear, according to announcement, a 
new literary weekly whose contributors will be of 
various countries and of divers parties and creeds. 
For example, articles are promised from such 
writers as Mr. H. G. Wells, who will treat the 
subject of industrial unrest; Mr. G. K. Chesterton, 
who will handle peasant proprietorship ; Professor 
Hans Delbriick, who will consider how to make 
more cordial the relations between England and 
Germany; Professor Cestre (of the University of 
Bordeaux), who will give a Frenchman's view of 
Mr. George Bernard Shaw; Professor Saintsbury, 
who will write on Balzac and on Sir Walter Scott; 
and the Abbe* Houtin, whose pen will depict the 
character of Pope Pius the Tenth. A periodical so 
hospitable to writers of whatever nation or creed 
might well choose for a motto, if it had not already 
been preempted, Tros Tyriusque mihi nullo dis- 
crimine agetur. ... 

SUPPOSED QUALIFICATIONS FOR LIBRARIANSHIP, 

as that office is viewed by the uninitiated, who often 
regard it as a dignified sinecure to be obtained by 
favor or influence of a political or other nature, in- 
clude, first and foremost, a limitless capacity for 
sitting in an easy chair and reading books all day. 
Miss Hoover, the experienced head of the Galesburg 
Public Library, takes occasion, in her current Report, 
to touch on this matter as follows : " With the ma- 
jority of people the idea prevails that the duties of 
a library attendant consist in handing out the re- 
quired book or furnishing the desired information, 



leaving the attendant ample time to spend in the 
enjoyment of reading. The frequency with which 
an applicant for a library position states as a quali- 
fication the fact that he is ' very fond of reading ' 
proves the popularity of the idea." But, as a matter 
of prosaic fact, " each day in a busy library sees a 
large amount of routine work done aside from the 
delivery of books, the compiling and recording of 
statistics, re-writing of book-cards, issuing of bor- 
rowers' cards, writing of notices of overdue and of 
reserve books, the recovery of overdue books, the 
business correspondence, the financial book-keeping, 
the type-writing of book-lists and bulletins, the me- 
chanical preparation of books for circulation, the 
mending and repair of books, the care of pamphlets, 
keeping books in order on the shelves," and various 
other duties which are not mentioned, but which any 
library worker can easily add. In short, to adapt 
an old and familiar rhyme, 

Though other folk's work be from sun to sun, 

The librarian's task is never done. 

"THE TOLSTOY OF GERMANY" is what some of 
Professor Rudolf Eucken's admirers call the famous 
professor of philosophy at the University of Jena. 
His acceptance of the exchange professorship at 
Harvard for the coming year ( at the same time that 
ProfessorBergson accepts a similar call to Columbia) 
directs attention anew to his personality and his 
work. The feeling of attachment and enthusiastic 
devotion with which his many disciples regard him, 
the deserved distinction of being awarded a Nobel 
prize, the increasing rapidity with which his books 
sell both in his own and in foreign lands, give assur- 
ance that his lectures at Harvard this winter will be 
well worth hearing and will not be delivered before 
empty benches. Dr. Eucken is sixty-seven years 
old, and has held his present chair at Jena since his 
call in 1874 from Basel, where he had occupied a 
similar position for three years. His university 
training was received at Gottingen. His best-known 
book, to English readers at least, is "The Problem 
of Human Life, as Viewed by the Great Thinkers 
from Plato to the Present Time." The teachings 
of this philosopher, like those of his eminent contem- 
poraries, Professors James and Bergson, emphasize 
the non-fixedness of reality. Truth with them is 
not something forever finished and unalterable, but 
rather an evolution, a process that continues, a drama 
that unrolls. The problem of the universe can hope 
for no final solution, but must be attacked afresh, 
from new points of assault, in each succeeding age. 
Professor Eucken's way of handling the riddle has 
afforded stimulus and cheer for many a bewildered 
and often pessimistic student of the baffling problem. 

IMPROVING THE CONDITIONS OF COUNTRY LIFE 
forms one of the themes most frequently turned to 
oratorical uses by the most volubly eloquent of our 
present candidates for the highest public office in 
the land. And meanwhile, it is worth noting, this 
same improvement of rural conditions is being made 



1912.] 



THE DIAL 



233 



the subject of some quiet and, it is already evident, 
fruitful study by the combined intelligence of the 
Massachusetts Library Commission and the Massa- 
chusetts Library Club. An example of what rural 
library work can accomplish has been recently fur- 
nished by the little hill town of Pomfret, Vermont, 
whose activities in this field are so well described 
by Mr. John Cotton Dana in a most interesting illus- 
trated pamphlet. It was only the other day that 
our attention was called to the improved condition 
of a western Massachusetts farming town of not 
more than five hundred inhabitants ; and amid the 
other signs of local progress was the revived aspect 
of the public library, which had recently been placed 
in charge of a trained librarian and provided with 
suitable quarters. Books are not the sole road to 
salvation, and unassisted by other agencies they can 
do little; but in the interplay of all the countless 
elements of a progressive civilization the dissemi- 
nation of good reading-matter probably counts for 
much more than is generally suspected. 


BOOK-BUYERS, BOOK-BORROWERS, AND THE PAR- 
CELS POST ought to have been brought into a more 
satisfactory relationship, the two former to the last- 
named, than was effected by Congress in the provis- 
ions of the new postal regulation to take effect next 
January. Books and similar printed matter ought 
to enjoy the benefit of the reduced rates accorded to 
merchandise under the new system. Librarians, 
publishers, booksellers, library-users, and all who 
handle books are interested in securing facilities less 
expensive than those now furnished by the mail and 
the express companies, for the carriage of books to 
and from libraries and bookshops and from friend 
to friend. The approaching holiday season will 
once more make our people conscious that the pur- 
chase of gift book's for Christmas offerings by no 
means ends the outlay necessary for their presenta- 
tion to distant friends. Though the green-grocer 
and the drygoods-dealer may profit by the new regu- 
lation, the book-hungry backwoods folk, dependent 
on some form of library extension for their reading 
matter, must possess their souls in patience until a 
dilatory Congress shall see fit to frame and pass a 
parcels-post law that is something more than a rider 
to an appropriation bill hurried through in the last 
days of an unduly protracted session. 



REORGANIZING A PUBLIC LIBRARY, especially one 
that has reached a considerable size and is nearly 
a quarter of a century old, is no holiday diversion. 
The new librarian of the Los Angeles Public Library 
is now engaged in this work of reorganization, as 
appears from the current Report of that energetic 
and progressive institution. In the Directors' Report 
we read : " On September 8th [of last year] Mr. 
Everett R. Perry, of the New York Public Library, 
was appointed librarian. Through Mr. Perry's tire- 
less efforts since that time, several departments of 
the Library have been reorganized, and the standards 



of efficiency of the library service very highly im- 
proved. This has been attested by a wider interest 
in the Library, manifested by a very heavy increase 
in circulation." The first of six Carnegie branch 
libraries is about to be built, and sites for five of the 
six have been given and have met with the Board's 
approval. From the reports of the various heads of 
departments, as well as from that of the librarian-in- 
chief, it is clear that the literary needs of the com- 
munity are to suffer no neglect, as far as Mr. Perry 
and his associates can prevent it. 



CHINESE SENSATIONAL FICTION apparently re- 
sembles the same class of literature elsewhere in 
its shameless appeal to the love of all that is hair- 
raising and horrible in description, plot, and 
character-painting. That our " shilling shockers " 
and " penny dreadfuls " should have their counter- 
parts wherever books are printed, is as inevitable 
as that rivers should run down to the sea. The 
" North China Herald " deplores the crude sensa- 
tionalism of certain recent native works of fiction 
that seem to be showing a tendency to supplant the 
older classic romances. One of these lurid tales 
bears the bloodcurdling title, "The Magistrate's 
Decision on the Dismembered Corpse of a Rake." 
A synopsis of the plot is given, but even that is too 
disagreeable to reproduce here. One is amused, 
however, by the unconscious humor displayed in the 
last chapter of the book, where the author turns 
preacher and gravely points the moral of his story 
by cautioning his readers against indulging their 
passions and harboring in their bosoms the vices 
depicted in the preceding pages. Nine-tenths of 
the readers will skip the moral, and the remaining 
tenth will give it slight heed ; but the manufacturer 
of the wretched stuff has salved his conscience, or 
thinks he has. 

BOOKS AND THE WEATHER seem to stand in a 
certain important relationship, the one to the other, 
that is recognized by booksellers and publishers. 
Without going so far as to say that book-sales are 
" servile to all the skyey influences," one might 
safely maintain that, other things being equal, a 
rainy season will quicken the circulation of books, 
and a season of sunshine will retard it. Just now 
the abundant and protracted rainstorms in England 
are rejoicing the English publishers' and booksellers' 
hearts ; for the people, out of sheer desperation, if 
from no higher motive, are turning to literature and 
swelling the receipts of those who deal in printed 
matter, who in their turn are joyfully making hay 
while the sun is obscured. And this may suggest 
to the curious observer that one great reason why 
northern Europe reads more than southern, why 
Scandinavia buys more books than Spain, lies in the 
greater prevalence of gloomy weather among the 
hyperboreans. It was confidently predicted in 
Copenhagen not long ago that as soon as Captain 
Amundsen's book on the South Pole should appear, 



234 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



three out of every four street-car conductors and 
motormen would be reading it. Could any such 
gratifying spectacle be looked for in the lands of 
sunshine and of almost uninterrupted outdoor life 
and of perpetual dolce far niente ? 



FRIENDLINESS TO THE FOREIGNER is the note 
struck by the so-called Foreign Reading Room of the 
Broadway Branch of the Cleveland Public Library. 
This room, says an illustrated leaflet issued by the 
library, " is very interesting to those who do not for- 
get the Fatherland. It contains the books in lan- 
guages other than English, and also magazines from 
Europe. The librarian will always be glad to receive 
suggestions for new titles." Attention is given to 
the literary needs of Bohemians, Germans, Poles, 
Slovenians, Hungarians, Finns, Italians, Lithua- 
nians and others. The English-reading public is, 
of course, also abundantly provided for. Small de- 
scriptive folders and book-lists in a number of foreign 
languages are circulated by the Broadway Branch, 
which seems to be in the heart of the foreign quarter 
of Cleveland, and to be doing its best to relieve the 
immigrant's homesickness and to open for him the 
way to intelligent citizenship in the land of his 
adoption. ... 

"A FUNDAMENTAL PARADOX OF EDUCATION," 

which the advocates of vocational and industrial 
training would do well to consider, finds itself well 
stated by President Hibben of Princeton in a 
discussion of "True Conservatism in Education," 
in the New York "Times." He calls attention to 
the frequency with which "the most immediate and 
direct means of bringing about a desired end for 
that very reason tends to neutralize itself, and thus 
to defeat its own purpose. In other words, there 
is no short cut to knowledge. The particular task 
in life must be allowed for some time at least to 
remain in the background of thought and of 
endeavor. A thorough training of all the powers 
of the man is the best preparation for the particular 
work, whatever it may be, which awaits him." 
One is reminded by this of the especial and diligent 
attention bestowed by Dr. Martineau, in his school 
days, on the studies least congenial to him and 
least likely to bear directly on his woi'k in after 
life. The story of the youth who, on being asked 
why he spent so much time over the dialogues of 
Plato, answered, " Because I am going to be a civil 
engineer," is not without its point and significance. 



PUBLISHERS IN PETTICOATS will not long astonish 
by their rarity. In this country we already have 
the Alice Harriman Company, with a number of 
noteworthy books to its credit; and in London there 
has just been organized a promising business house 
under the name of the Happy Publishing Company 
conducted entirely by women, handling only books 
written by women, and, to a considerable extent, 
employing women in their manufacture. The first 
venture of the Happy Publishing Company is the 



maiden effort of a new writer, Mrs. M. M. Lee, and 
is entitled ''Love's Victories," which should appeal 
especially to women. Women writers may like to 
have the address of this new publishing house; it 
is 133 Salisbury Square, Fleet Street, E. C. 



ENGLISH POLITICS AND ENGLISH 
LITERATURE. 



(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 
The combination of politics and the practice of 
letters is becoming rare in England, and perhaps 
in other countries as well. Or it might be more 
just to say that it is less successful: that we fail 
to produce now (for Lord Morley's work, excellent 
as it is, belongs rather to a past age) men who are at 
once considerable politicians and in the front rank 
as authors men of the stamp of Lord Macaulay 
and Benjamin Disraeli, Earl of Beaconsfield. I say 
this with the full knowledge that we possess cer- 
tain members of the Cabinet at the present moment 
who have written agreeably in the past, and may do 
so again. Our Irish secretary is still Mr. Augustine 
Birrell, who won his literary spurs many years ago 
with several pleasant volumes of light essays; our 
secretary for Foreign Affairs, Sir Edward Grey, 
wrote a book on fly-fishing, which has become a 
classic in its own field; an ex-prime minister, Lord 
Rosebery, has produced more than one biographical 
work of interest and literary ability. But none of 
these men, not even Mr. Birrell, can be said to take 
literature seriously. Politics is their chief occupa- 
tion : they turn to the other (some of them) in the 
all too scanty moments of leisure snatched from 
parliamentary duties; and it is pretty safe to say 
that such immortality as they may earn will be due 
to their deeds in the political rather than in the 
literary field. Nor can I detect signs of any new 
men arising to take the places of those I have 
mentioned. Parliament still possesses Sir Gilbert 
Parker ; for a short while he had as companions in 
the House two tolerably distinguished novelists in 
Mr. Belloc and Mr. A. E. W. Mason. They came, 
and saw, and were conquered: the Mother of Par- 
liaments proved too much for them. Mr. Belloc 
has never ceased since to declare his conviction that 
the whole system of party government is rotten to 
the core. 

There has, in fact, been of late years a general 
increase in the pace of political life, a " speeding- 
up" process, as the modern phrase has it, which 
must necessarily be alien to the literary mind. Our 
legislators are now paid for their services, and ac- 
cordingly they are full of new-born zeal: they feel 
that they must give the country something for its 
money; and the consequence is that they have 
fallen into the habit of passing new bills at break- 
neck speed and after very inadequate consideration. 
Indeed, the ordinary Member of Parliament has no 
occasion to think matters over for himself: he is 



1912.J 



THE DIAJL 



235 



practically the creature of his party, and must obey 
the dictates of the machine. Now, your man of 
letters, at the worst, has a sort of pride : he believes 
in his own judgment; he was chosen to this respon- 
sible post, he imagines, because of his superiority 
of intellect, and it would clearly be absurd not to 
utilize this valuable quality in the public interest. 
Consequently, he is apt to prove a difficult subject 
for the management of the party authorities, who 
require above all things men who will do what they 
are told and argue to order. It is for this reason 
that we find so large a preponderance of legal gen- 
tlemen in the House. And the place that used to 
be filled by the man of letters is now commonly oc- 
cupied by the journalist. 

I perceive that Lord Morley, in a recent speech 
delivered at a complimentary dinner to a well-known 
journalist, remarked upon the number of recent prime 
ministers who had made their mark in the realm of 
books. If they had been drawn by the necessities 
of life into journalism, he, in his editorial days, would 
have guaranteed any one of the five a very excellent 
salary. Perhaps we should not take the words of 
an after-dinner speaker too seriously ; but it is a little 
remarkable that Lord Morley, possibly our last sur- 
viving example of the combined politician and man 
of letters, should instinctively have appraised the 
worth of these gentlemen in the light of his experi- 
ence as editor rather than as literary critic. Disraeli, 
Gladstone, Rosebery, Balfour, the late Lord Salis- 
bury (these, I imagine, were the sacred five referred 
to) all possessed undoubted ability as writers. But 
the majority of them (I am inclined to except Mr. 
Balfour, who has written a Defence of Philosophic 
Doubt) saw things from the point of view of the poli- 
tical journalist, a point of view which is proverbi- 
ally one-eyed. Their literary quality was apt to be 
swamped in their desire to prove a thesis : the habit 
of debate had gained possession of them. Thus it 
was even as long ago as the days of Macaulay, who 
wrote his History of England and found it turn 
under his hands to a Defence of Whiggery. 

But the name of Macaulay remains, and will re- 
main, a bright spot in the literary history of his time. 
We may perhaps attribute this to his consistently 
independent attitude. He entered Parliament as the 
member for Calne, then a " pocket borough " of the 
Lord Lansdowne of that day, but with the express 
understanding that he was to have complete freedom 
of action. Subsequently, when he took office, in 1832, 
he was always prepared to sacrifice his place rather 
than his convictions. And, in his days, it was pos- 
sible for a Member of Parliament to speak his mind 
in debate and to record his vote according to his real 
opinions. The party machine had not yet arrived, 
to crush all the individuality out of the private mem- 
ber, making of him nothing but a single cog-wheel 
in the complicated apparatus of power. It was still 
possible for a man to enter the House of Commons 
and preserve his self-respect. It was not necessary 
for him then to keep his name before his constituents, 
under pain of being forced to resign if he failed to 



take a share in debate, or to make himself conspicu- 
ous at question-time. He had not the fear of the 
local paper before his eyes. Gibbon, the historian 
of the " Decline and Fall," could sit seven years for 
Liskeard, recording none but silent votes. Pride 
hastened to excuse a natural timidity, and he con- 
fessed that even " the success of my pen discouraged 
the trial of my voice." Yet, as his training in the 
Southampton militia enabled him to examine the 
battles of antiquity with an intelligent eye, so his 
Parliamentary experience was not without value. 
"The eight sessions that I sat in Parliament," he 
wrote, " were a school of civil prudence, the first 
and most essential virtue of an historian." 

The great speakers filled Gibbon with despair : the 
bad ones with apprehension, to use once again his 
inimitable stateliness of phrase. More than half a 
century earlier, the same diffidence made an equally 
silent member of Addison, who presented the curious 
spectacle, impossible in these strenuous days, of a 
silent Secretary of State. The great essayist is re- 
corded, perhaps apocryphally, to have made one 
attempt in the direction of parliamentary oratory, 
but his shyness overcame him, and he sat down in 
confusion. Indeed, it must be admitted that our 
literary politicians have not invariably attained a 
success as public speakers commensurate with the 
command of language they displayed in other fields. 
Against Macaulay, Sheridan, and Disraeli must be 
set Addison, Gibbon, John Stuart Mill, and perhaps 
the late Mr. Lecky. But Mill, though not an elo- 
quent debater, was heard with attention, and his 
career in Parliament may be said to have extended 
his influence. 

The historian and the philosopher, as is only nat- 
ural, bulk more largely in active political life than 
the poet. Yet Andrew Marvell and Matthew Prior 
sat in Parliament, and the latter was secretary to the 
embassy at The Hague and afterwards to the pleni- 
potentiaries who concluded the Peace of Ryswick. 
A lighter strain in verse has proved not incompatible 
with a certain success in the House of Commons. 
W. M. Praed and Richard Monckton Milnes may 
be cited as examples. Of novelists few can be said 
to have made much mark in parliamentary history, 
with the considerable exceptions of Disraeli and 
Bulwer Lytton. Yet the life has evidently possessed 
a fascination for them. Thackeray stood for Oxford 
in 1857, but was defeated, perhaps fortunately, 
by Mr. Card well, afterwards Secretary for War; 
some ten years later his biographer, Anthony Trol- 
lope, followed his footsteps in becoming candidate 
for Beverley. In more recent times Mr. Anthony 
Hope Hawkins, among a host of others, has tried his 
fortune at the polls. But it is doubtful whether 
modern parliamentary life can find much use for the 
peculiar qualities of the successful novelist. Perhaps 
Mr. H. G. Wells, with his remarkably constructive 
imagination, might prove an exception. 

Whatever appeal politics may make to literature, 
it is clear that literature, in itself, makes but the 
smallest appeal to the politician. The man of let-

ters at the present day receives but little in the shape 
of honors or rewards from those in power ; and what 
little he obtains is almost invariably bestowed upon 
him (as though of set purpose) for some other rea- 
son than his achievements as an author. Carlyle 
was offered a baronetcy by Sir Robert Peel ; Tenny- 
son was raised to the peerage. But since the date 
of his accession to that high order it is difficult to 
think of any author (with the possible exception of 
the late Sir Walter Besant) who has been included 
in the list of honors for purely literary reasons. We 
have a sufficiency of military and naval knights, as 
is only just and proper: to the lay mind it seems 
that the order of knighthood might reasonably be 
confined to the two services. But since the politician 
and the medical man have now come to claim at least 
an equal share in these honors we cannot but feel 
that literature is somewhat neglected. We have, it 
is true, a few knights in our ranks. An editor or 
two has received the honor ; a newspaper proprietor 
has been raised to the peerage ; the other day a pub- 
lisher was knighted ; but these honors hardly belong 
t6 pure literature. Among authors we possess Sir 
Arthur Conan Doyle, who owes his honor chiefly 
to his services during the South African War; Sir 
A. T. Quiller Couch and Sir Gilbert Parker, who 
owe theirs to political work ; and Sir H. Rider Hag- 
gard, whose suggestions for a scheme of national 
land settlement in Great Britain were held to out- 
weigh his claims as a writer of romance. A knight- 
hood is, I admit, but a barren honor ; but if we may 
no longer look for embassies to The Hague, like Mat 
Prior, or even consulships such as fell to the lot of 
Charles Lever, it remains, I imagine, the best that 
we can expect. It might occasionally be bestowed 
upon men of real mark in their profession, as a re- 
ward for excellence in their own work rather than 
for a combination of literary talent with political or 
other services. K H . LACON WATSON.

COMMUNICATION. 



SOME POINTS IN THE HISTORY OF FORT 

DEARBORN. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The nature of Mr. Currey's letter in THE DIAL for 
Sept. 16, concerning my review of his book on Fort 
Dearborn, impels me to submit the following observa- 
tions. 

In the review in question I developed reasons for the 
judgment expressed that from the serious historical 
viewpoint the work is of but slight, if any, value. The 
author replies to this with a bitter arraignment which 
seeks to discredit the review by representing the re- 
viewer as prejudiced and dishonest, and by explaining 
away a few of the many errors to which attention was 
called in the review. 

Did time and inclination permit, it would be much 
easier to riddle the statements contained in the writer's 
letter than it was to establish the unsound character of 
his book. However, I have as little inclination for, as 



the public would have interest in, a personal dispute 
with Mr. Currey. To enter upon such a course would 
only detract attention from the sole issue of any public 
or, to me at least, private interest. So far as the pub- 
lic interest is concerned, it is immaterial whether the 
reviewer is in private life habitually dishonest, as Mr. 
Currey seems to think, or whether Mr. Currey's passion 
overcame for the time being his sense of fairness and 
his regard for the truth, as the reviewer believes. It 
is a matter of some concern to the reading public, I take 
it, whether the truth of history lies with Mr. Currey's 
book which was reviewed, or with the criticisms which 
the reviewer passed upon it. 

Nor do I perceive the utility of imposing upon the 
readers of THE DIAL a detailed discussion of the his- 
torical issues raised in Mr. Currey's letter. It would 
be an easy thing to show that all of them are unsound. 
Mrs. Heald was but a young woman in 1812, instead of 
thirty- six years of age; it is not true that the public had 
no access to knowledge concerning the date of begin- 
ning the construction of the first Fort Dearborn, prior to 
the reviewer's "Record-Herald" article of last month; 
it is a fact that " Surgeon " Cooper was the same indi- 
vidual as " surgeon's mate " Cooper, and that neither 
he nor another man of this name was killed in the 
massacre; it is not true, as any schoolboy knows, that 
General Dearborn performed " distinguished " services 
on the Niagara frontier. And so with the other errors 
which the author committed, and now vainly seeks to 
deny. I neither expect nor care to convince Mr. Cur- 
rey of these things; the casual reader can have little 
interest in a detailed discussion of them ; and other stu- 
dents who turn their attention to the field of local his- 
tory will find little difficulty in deciding which of us is 
in the right. 

In a word, my only interest in the whole matter is to 
see what I believe to be the truth of history prevail. 
The only issue between us which interests me pertains 
solely to this. I believe the author's preparation for his 
work to have been only superficial; that his methods 
of work are fundamentally unsound; and consequently 
that the issue of his labors, judged as history, is value- 
less. In his resentment over the expression of this 
judgment he has resorted to a bitter ad hominem argu- 
ment with the design of discrediting it. 

In this connection one or two further points demand 
attention. It was furthest from my thought to impute 
the invention of the stories growing out of Captain 
Heald's action with reference to the arms and ammuni- 
tion to Mr. Currey, and this a correct reading of the 
review will show. The extent of his responsibility is 
that he ignorantly copied the stories as though they were 
true. So far as his statements concerning the paper I 
read at the meeting of the Mississippi Valley Historical 
Association are concerned, he has simply ascribed to the 
audience generally (and this without any possible war- 
rant) what I am quite willing to believe were his own 
private impressions. A letter of inquiry as to the source 
on which he based his statement concerning the re- 
viewer's futile efforts " to secure a further hearing " at 
the hands of the Chicago Historical Society, elicits the 
explanation that he " got the impression " from a re- 
porter's article in the " Tribune " recently. The truth 
is that the reviewer is in no way responsible for the 
article in question, which abounded in errors, and that 
the statement which Mr. Currey based upon it is quite 
without foundation in fact. MILO MILTON QUAIFE.

THE FOUNDER OF A GREAT AMERICAN 
PUBLISHING HOUSE.* 

Some of the most interesting books about 
books and bookmen have in recent years come 
from the hands of those engaged in the business 
of producing books and in enlisting in their ser- 
vice the most distinguished and talented writers 
of books. The reminiscences of men like Mr. 
Edward Marston, the veteran London publisher, 
and Mr. J. Henry Harper, the well-known 
New York publisher, have a quality of interest 
not to be found in memoirs of any other kind. 
It is with keenest pleasure that lovers of such 
intimate histories of literature in the making 
hail the appearance of Mr. George Haven Put- 
nam's filial tribute to the memory of the founder 
of the House of Putnam. "George Palmer 
Putnam: A Memoir" is packed with both lit- 
erary and human interest, the winning personal- 
ity of the man holding the attention no less than 
the remarkable achievements of the publisher. 

George Palmer Putnam, of good New En- 
gland stock that traces its descent back to the 
Puttenhams, Puttnams, and Putnams of Buck- 
inghamshire, was born in 1814 at Brunswick, 
Maine, where his mother, Catherine Hunt Pal- 
mer, of Dorchester, had opened a private school 
in 1808 upon the disablement, from illness, of 
her husband, Henry Palmer of Boston, a lawyer 
by profession. In his mother's school George 
received his education, side by side with his 
sisters, and the discipline maintained, both on 
weekdays and Sundays, seems to have been of 
the good old Puritan sort. That the mother 
was a woman of strong character and vigorous 
intellect appears from many facts and incidents 
transmitted through the son to the grandson, 
and notably from her having written a series of 
Bible commentaries which the founder of the 
Putnam publishing house brought out in two 
octavo volumes soon after he had firmly estab- 
lished himself in New York. But the breaking- 
away from home, under the compulsion of 
narrowness of means, had come much earlier 
than that, in 1825, when the lad's uncle, John 
Gulliver, had proposed to take him into appren- 
ticeship in his carpet business in Boston. There 
he remained until 1829, when, with courage 
and enterprise not found in every boy of fifteen, 
he made his way to the scene of his subsequent

labors and obtained employment with a book- 
seller and stationer, carrying on his education 
meanwhile in late evening hours at the Mer- 
cantile Library. In certain " Eough Notes of 
Thirty Years in the Trade," reprinted from the 
"American Publishers' Circular" of 1863, we 
get a glimpse of the boy voraciously reading 
everything in the way of history that came to 
his hand. He writes : 

"It had so happened that though my father had 
graduated at Harvard, and my home influences were of 
the educated and cultivated sort, I had not received 
even the ordinary elementary 'schooling,' to say nothing 
of a college course, and further, 1 had been permitted 
even less than ordinary access to general reading. It 
is, therefore, a pleasure to testify, as I can very heartily, 
to the usefulness of the New York Mercantile Library, 
then a few years old, and just located in the new Clinton 
Hall, in Beekman Street, the corner-stone of which I had 
seen laid by that liberal-minded citizen, Philip Hone. 
In these degenerate days, boys in my position of sixteen 
or seventeen are usually dismissed from the ' store ' at 
six or seven o'clock. In 1831-32, we were kept till 
nine or ten; so that it was usually after nine when I 
could get to the Mercantile and take out my book. It 
chanced that my tastes rather turned from the novels 
to the more solid interest of a course of history. Begin- 
ning with Father Herodotus (in Beloe's English) I 
plodded on through Thucydides, Xenophon, Livy, 
Tacitus, Sal lust; then Gibbon, Russell's Modern Europe, 
several histories of England, including Hume, Lingard, 
Smollett, and De Moleville. Crammed with some hun- 
dred and fifty octavos, rapidly mastered in succession, 
and with no clear guide at hand, personal or in book- 
shape, to systematise and classify the stock of lore thus 
acquired, I began to take notes and make parallel tables. 
I copied and recopied, and collated and revised until I 
had written over a couple of reams." 

These reams of notes took book-form in 1832, 
when their writer was but eighteen years old, 
in a work that ultimately became very well 
known as " The World's Progress." Jonathan 
Leavitt was the courageous publisher, and he 
evidently did not repent of his confidence re- 
posed in the boy-author, since the edition soon 
sold out. 

Thus in a small way had begun the book- 
producing activities of one whose calling and 
election to the publishing business were not 
slow to make themselves manifest. In 1833 
he entered the employment of Wiley and Long, 
publishers and booksellers; seven years later 
the firm of Wiley and Putnam was formed; 
from 1841 to 1847 the junior member of this 
firm acted in London as English representative 
of the house ; in 1848 the partnership was dis- 
solved and Mr. Putnam began business on his 
own account at 155 Broadway, in the very 
centre of the commercial life of that day; and 
thenceforward to the present time, with some 
financial reverses and one intermission in the

sixties, when the founder of the house held the 
government position of Collector of Revenue, 
the Putnam publishing business has continued 
to grow in magnitude and in honorable repute. 
The inestimable service rendered to the cause 
of international copyright by both the elder and 
the younger Putnam, in the office of secretary 
and inspiring genius of successive copyright 
leagues and associations, and by eloquent and 
reiterated word of mouth and pen, would fur- 
nish matter for far more lengthy narration and 
approving comment than can here find space. 
Mr. George Haven Putnam tells most interest- 
ingly the story of his father's self-sacrificing 
exertions to bring about the desired legislation, 
and Mr. R. R. Bowker has very recently, in his 
painstaking history of copyright, chronicled the 
services of both father and son in this field of 
reform. It was in 1872, in a fifth vain attempt 
to effect a correction of ancient abuses, that Mr. 
Putnam, senior, spent his strength so lavishly 
and against such discouraging odds as to under- 
mine his health and hasten his death. After 
going to Washington, at the request of the 
Publishers' Association, to push the pending 
copyright bill through the Judiciary Committee, 
he found the measure opposed in the committee- 
meeting by the attorney of a prominent New 
York publishing house which had been under- 
stood to be not antagonistic to the proposed 
legislation. The narrative continues : 

" My father's personal disappointment and annoy- 
ance were naturally keen. The bill itself never got out 
of committee. Senator Lot M. Morrill, of Vermont, the 
Chairman of the Library Committee, in making an ad- 
verse report to the consideration by Congress of any 
international copyright bill, took the ground, naturally 
enough, that ' there was no unanimity of opinion among 
those interested in the measure.' Fifteen years later, 
the Harpers who were then directing the affairs of the 
House had convinced themselves that their interests 
were not adverse to international copyright, and I was 
able, having succeeded my father as Secretary of the 
Publishers' Copyright League, to maintain before the 
Judiciary Committee the contention that the publishers 
were united in support of the measure and had author- 
ized me to speak for them ; and the international copy- 
right for which my father had laboured for nearly one 
third of a century was at last brought about. The fatigue 
of the journey and the disappointment, not only at the 
failure of the undertaking, but at the annoyance that 
question should have been raised in the Committee con- 
cerning his right to speak as a representative of the 
publishers, had something to do with bringing on the fit 
of exhaustion that caused his death a few weeks later." 

In honorable endeavor to inflict no injury on 
any foreign author introduced to his patrons, 
but rather to promote to the utmost the material 
welfare of such authors, the founder of the 
Putnam house distinguished himself above any 



of his competitors. Other firms have shown 
splendid liberality to eminent authors who could 
claim no legal protection from piracy; but in 
uniformity of honest and considerate dealings 
with all foreign writers whose works were solic- 
ited for republication in this country, it is safe 
to assert that no other publishing house can show 
quite so clean a record as the one whose history 
is now offered to public perusal. The list of 
early Victorian authors whose American inter- 
ests were as far as possible guarded and pro- 
moted by Mr. Putnam is significant in this 
connection. It includes the names of Carlyle, 
Thomas Hood, William Howitt, Leigh Hunt, 
Coleridge, Layard, Kinglake, and George Bor- 
row. Fredrika Bremer was another whose books 
he tried to shield from piracy ; but a powerful 
rival, even after courteously receiving Miss 
Bremer and being made aware of the close con- 
nection between that lady's length of sojourn in 
this country and her receipts from the American 
sale of her books, refused to recede from the posi- 
tion that courtesy was courtesy and business was 
business ; and so " the receipts from the author- 
ised editions were necessarily curtailed, and the 
poor little lady returned to Stockholm with plea- 
sant memories of some American friends, but 
not a little disappointed at the final results of 
her invasion of the States." The names of 
native authors to be found in the early cata- 
logues of the Putnam house form a brilliant list 
and include those of Cooper, Washington Irving, 
Bayard Taylor, Poe, Lowell, Catherine Sedg- 
wick, and Professor Dana of Yale. If to these 
are added the names of writers secured for the 
pages of the magazine started in 1853 by Mr. 
Putnam, the showing becomes still more impres- 
sive. He had a decided genius for winning to 
himself, in both a business and a friendly way, 
the leading authors of his time. A description 
from his pen (originally published in his maga- 
zine) of one of these noted writers may be in 
place at this point. 

" The name of FENIMORE COOPER in American author- 
ship was a prominent one during his life. . . . He was 
as conspicuous in person as in intellect, standing over 
six feet in height strong, erect, well proportioned 
with the air and manner of one who claimed the right 
to be listened to, and to have his dictum respected. . . . 
One of his axioms appeared to be, that the very posses- 
sion of office or of popular favour in this country was 
prima-facie evidence of incompetency, superficial attain- 
ment, or positive dishonesty. (It is rather sad to think, 
that if he had lived longer, this estimate of popular and 
official success might have been strengthened rather 
than diminished.) He loved to demonstrate this by ex- 
amples and would even include such names as Edward 
Everett and others whose fame and position were beyond 
ordinary question. His views on personal rights were

very decided, and often decidedly expressed. Coming 
from myhouseatStaten Island, he took occasion having 
been brusquely jostled by a carman driving onto the ferry- 
boat to give him a five-minute lecture on the inherent 
rights of foot passengers as against all vehicles whatso- 
ever. The dignity and force of the argument evidently 
impressed both the carman and the bystanders." 

The subjects of interest either touched upon 
or elaborated in this biography are so many as to 
preclude the possibility of doing the book justice 
in a review of this length. The author's account 
of his father's London sojourn and European 
travels, his picture of him at the battle of Bull 
Run, whither he had been driven by a consum- 
ing desire to witness what it was surmised might 
be the last as well as the first sanguinary engage- 
ment of the war, his narration of the varying 
fortunes of the struggling young publishing 
house, his introduction of literary celebrities 
from chapter to chapter these are some of the 
features of a work crowded with entertaining and 
(as a part of our literary history) important and 
instructive matter. From the many paragraphs 
affording an insight into the character of a man 
who deservedly commanded wide respect and 
admiration, we select for final quotation the fol- 
lowing, which refers to the second period of the 
commercially unfortunate"Putnam'sMagazine." 
The pathos of the picture makes a moving appeal. 
" The closing of this second series of the magazine 
was a very keen personal disappointment to the pub- 
lisher whose name it bore. It was, in fact, a shock 
that really added at once to my father's age. The 
feeling that he was no longer in touch with the reading 
public, that his literary judgment could not be depended 
upon as trustworthy, that his personal influence could 
not bring into his office, in the face of the competition 
of other publishers, the best literary material of the 
day, the hampering restriction of want of adequate 
resources with which to carry out larger and more per- 
manent literary plans all these things weighed upon 
him in a manner that would not have been possible in 
the earlier years when he still possessed full physical 
vigor and with this maintained his natural elasticity of 
temperament. In years he was still fairly young, but 
it was evident that in vitality or in working strength 
the corner had been turned." 

The biography makes us acquainted with a 
man of invincible courage and optimism, of fine 
confidence (sometimes misplaced) in human na- 
ture, of rare determination to succeed by none 
but honorable means, in the face of competition 
not always equally honorable, of the gentleness 
and strength that are never, either of them, com- 
plete without the other, and of a personal charm 
that speaks to us even now in some of his 
recorded words and published utterances. The 
portrait prefixed to the work helps one to com- 
plete the mental image of this strong and win- 
some personality. PERCY F. BICKNELL. 



OUR RELATIONS WITH JAPAN.* 

One of the features of recent international 
relations most to be regretted has been the sub- 
stitution of suspicion and ill-will for the confi- 
dence and cordiality which for so long existed 
between Japan and the United States. Offi- 
cially, intercourse is as amicable as ever. On 
the part of Americans and Japanese who really 
understand the relations between the two coun- 
tries there is little tolerance for the fomenters 
of the present unrest. But in the case of the 
great uninformed public, in both countries, it 
must be recognized that, in recent years, a 
change in sentiment has taken place. 

The traditional friendship of the United 
States and Japan is unique in the story of the 
contact of East and West. During the fifty 
years between the opening of Japan by Perry's 
firm but kindly diplomacy, and the close of the 
great Eusso-Japanese struggle, the diplomatic 
relations of the United States and Japan were 
notable for the sympathetic attitude of the vigor- 
ous power of the West and for the apparent 
appreciation of the rising nation of the East. In 
comparison with the conduct of the powers of 
Europe the attitude of America stands out in 
sharp relief. And so in this period when Japan 
modelled her army on the French and German 
lines, and her navy on those of Britain, she 
turned to America for suggestions in education, 
in banking, and in other great productive fields 
of development. American missionaries and 
teachers performed services that were most ap- 
preciated by the eager Japanese. And in Amer- 
ica the little that was written about Japan and 
her people was almost without exception penned 
in glowing terms. 

Then came the war with Russia. American 
public opinion, so far as any might be said to 
exist, at once made the cause of the Japanese 
its own, and followed with satisfaction the un- 
broken record of success. But with the peace 
a change was manifest. The press which had 
scored the Muscovite so bitterly now found 
words of sympathy for the humbled Christian, 
and soon "public opinion" became less fulsome 
in its praise of the new world-power. Within a 
year the immigration problem had arisen and war 
talk became a matter of course, and the past five 
years have at frequent intervals seen the name 
of our old friend and protege written in scare- 
heads as our adversary in an unavoidable war. 
Two years span the change from admiration

to suspicion. What explanation can be given 
for such a phenomenon ? Mr. Kawakami, whose 
new volume entitled " American- Japanese Rela- 
tions" is a vigorous endeavor to right some of 
the wrong already done, dismisses the idea of 
jealousy, or of fear, or even of war-talk spread 
to sell warships and guns. The explanation 
which he offers is that Japan's commercial ad- 
vance in the Asian continent has alienated the 
western world. This may account for the mer- 
cantile interests and for their representatives in 
Asia, but it surely does not account for the rapid 
change of heart of "the man in the street," or 
for his willingness to read, even if not with 
entire conviction, the reckless statements of the 
mischief-makers. No explanation so simple as 
that can really explain. Many factors were 
present during those critical years. The first 
wave of anti-Japanese feeling was probably due 
to the sympathy which Americans always have 
for "the under-dog." Russia aggressive and 
intolerant was very different from Russia hum- 
bled and contrite. People had time to remem- 
ber the friendship of the Czar in 1863, and to 
realize that for the first time since the fall of 
Constantinople Asia had beaten back Europe. 
After this period of indecision came the San 
Francisco school-children incident, which was 
magnified into an international question; and 
then the time was ripe for articles inspired by 
commercial rivalry, by military expediency, 
and even by missionary policy. Many of these 
highly-colored preachments would have aroused 
little discussion if the reading public had been 
prepared properly to evaluate the arguments 
presented. But, as Mr. Kawakami remarks: 
"Meanwhile, belligerent words continue to be 
spoken, and alarmist notes continue to be 
sounded. The average American, by reason of 
want of unbiased information, is apparently 
inclined to listen to the counsels of jingoes and 
alarmists. Thus the cloud of misunderstanding 
is growing thicker every day, casting its gloom 
over American- Japanese relations." 

It was in an endeavor to clear up some of 
these misunderstandings that the present volume 
was written. Three great questions are dis- 
cussed, as the source of the more serious diffi- 
culties. The Manchurian Question is treated 
in seven chapters, which deal with the relative 
interests of Japan, China, Russia, and America 
in Manchuria. Ten chapters are devoted to 
the Korean Question, explaining why Japan 
annexed Korea and narrating the work of the 
Japanese before and after annexation. And, 
finally, six chapters deal with the Immigration 



Question on our Pacific Coast. As eleven of 
the chapters originally appeared in American 
and Japanese periodicals, the treatment is sug- 
gestive rather than profound, while in its moder- 
ation and in its endeavor to be fair it compares 
very favorably with certain recent discussions 
of some of these topics. 

In discussing the Manchurian Question, Mr. 
Kawakami emphasizes the price in blood and 
money which Japan paid for her present posi- 
tion in Manchuria, characterizes China's atti- 
tude toward Japan as " one of ingratitude and 
insincerity," criticizes Mr.Knox's neutralization 
proposal and recent American railway schemes 
in Manchuria, explains the present Russo- 
Japanese rapprochcment^smd asserts that Japan 
has scrupulously observed the "open door" 
policy. So, too, in the case of Korea, charge 
after charge that has been brought against 
Japan is considered and explained. It would 
be too much to expect that Mr. Kawakami 
possesses complete information as to the future 
plans of his government, but he is in a position 
satisfactorily to refute many of the criticisms 
which have of late been current. 

The chapters on the Immigration Question 
do not make pleasant reading for unprejudiced 
Americans. Japanese immigration, before the 
passport agreement, is discussed, as to its extent, 
its nature, and its comparison with European 
immigration. Two chapters bear the title 
" Denis Kearneyism Once More." There is 
much truth in this summary, though other 
factors were present: "Thus it was that the 
anti-Japanese agitation on the Pacific Coast of 
a few years ago began and subsided. It was 
the old story some one wanted to go to the 
Senate or the House, or some one had the guber- 
natorial bee buzzing in his bonnet, or some one 
wanted to sell his paper, or some one wanted to 
make a living by levying upon the innocent 
laborers, or some ' interests ' wanted to control 
Japanese labor for their exclusive benefit." The 
agitation began in 1905, and yet the next year 
Japan subscribed more than half the total for- 
eign subscription for the relief of the fire-swept 
city. In October the school-children case arose, 
and later the assaults upon Japanese business 
men and travellers. If the means employed 
were wretched in the extreme, the end gained 
was a most desirable one. By the agreement of 
1907 Japan voluntarily restricts her emigra- 
tion to our shores by means of a rigid passport 
system. Mr. Kawakami asserts that "the Japan- 
ese feel that, viewed in the light of the real 
status of Japanese immigration, such a drastic

measure of exclusion as was adopted by the two 
governments is not justified." This is no doubt 
the case, but, granting the existence of a strong 
prejudice against the Japanese on our Pacific 
Coast, this endeavor to remove irritation until 
the better understanding, such as Mr. Kawakami 
seeks to bring about, has been reached, seems 
eminently proper. Finally a plea is advanced 
for the naturalization of resident Japanese. 

Mr. Kawakami's book deserves a wide circu- 
lation. No doubt he over-estimates the real 
influence of the "jingoes and alarmists," for 
their outcries at times excite more consternation 
in Japan than among our own people. But his 
efforts, and those of other Americans and Japan- 
ese, will do much to restore the old relations 
which were so long a credit to America and

WHISTLER THE ARTIST.* 



Mr. Way justifies the addition of another 
volume to the already formidable quantity of 
printed words about Mr. Whistler by the state- 
ment that few of the books, magazines, and 
newspaper articles devoted to him and his art 
" suggest the real charm of Whistler the crafts- 
man." In any just estimate of his character this 
phase of it needs to be emphasized much more 
strongly than commonly it has been hitherto. 
His fame rests in quite disproportionate measure 
upon his idiosyncrasies, his wit, and his pugna- 
city. To those who were privileged to know 
Mr. Whistler intimately, these traits, though 
they enlivened intercourse with him, stood out 
far less prominently than those that constituted 
him one of the world's greatest artists: they 
were only another manifestation of the super- 
sensitiveness that quickened his perception of 
all artistic things, that made him so keenly ap- 
preciative of the beauty of tone relations, and 
enabled him to bring forth the works in which 
this beauty is so exquisitely presented. 

It is of Whistler the artist, and more partic- 
ularly of Whistler the lithographer, rather than 
the painter or the etcher, that Mr. Way gives 
his memories. His acquaintance with Mr. 
Whistler dates back to the year 1878, when 
the master's interest in lithography was first 
awakened by Mr. Way's father, a well-known 
lithographer and a life-long enthusiast and 
experimenter in all that concerns the process.

By T. R. Way. Illustrated. New York : John Lane Co. 



Then began frequent visits to Mr. Way's estab- 
lishment, where the father and son inducted 
the distinguished artist into the practical details 
of their craft. The intimacy formed while thus 
working side by side lasted until a short time 
before Mr. Whistler's death, when it was ter- 
minated by an unfortunate misunderstanding. 
The opportunity to follow the artist's mental 
processes which these years of close association 
afforded appears to have been accorded to no 
one else in such generous measure, and this gives 
Mr. Way's reminiscences a special value apart 
from their intrinsic interest. 

Among the things that stand forth most dis- 
tinctly in the book are Mr. Whistler's industry 
and his painstaking attention to every detail of 
craftsmanship. Like all great artists he was a 
master workman. He recognized clearly that 
only through the acquisition of consummate 
skill of hand could he impress his drawings with 
the subtle refinements, the almost imperceptible 
nuances that enter into the highest art and stamp 
it as a thing apart. When at work he was so 
absorbed in the effort to realize the precise effect 
he had in mind that he was oblivious to every 
other consideration. He disregarded his own 
comfort quite as much as that of his models. " I 
have never come across any one," says Mr. Way, 
" who could exist upon so little food as Whistler 
whilst he was at work." 

Another thing which Mr. Way brings out is 
that instead of ignoring all criticism and sug- 
gestion, as is generally supposed, Mr. Whistler 
" constantly appealed to those about him as to 
how they liked the work he was engaged upon 
and what they thought of it." Though he was 
irritated by inept comment from people whose 
education should have taught them how to look 
at works of art, he was ever ready to welcome 
intelligent discussion. In all that he did he 
never failed to keep basic principles clearly in 
mind. And when he had occasion to criticize 
other work, as that of his pupils, he dealt with 
these principles rather than with the execution, 
which he left almost alone, " thus doing nothing 
to interfere with the individuality of the student, 
but in the kindest way helping him with advice." 
A characteristic incident is related by Mr. Way : 
"I was painting a portrait of Dr. Whistler, 
at his Wimpole Street house, in 1883, and 
Whistler came and advised me about it, taking 
my brushes and working on the canvas to ex- 
plain his meaning. I found that whenever I 
showed him anything I had done, his criticisms 
were based upon my point of view, as it were." 
It was the same attitude of mind that caused 



242 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



him to be horrified at the idea of printing 
etchings in color. Rightly he felt this to 
be " utterly contrary to the principles of the 
art." 

Mr. Way's reminiscences are in large part 
devoted to Mr. Whistler's lithographic work, 
many of his experiments and his achievements 
being chronicled with considerable detail. For 
the reader not having technical knowledge there 
is a short account of the lithographic process. 
This, and also the descriptions of methods of 
working that occur here and there throughout 
the book, are exceptionally clear in statement. 
Naturally Mr. Way is partial toward lithog- 
raphy, and he expresses the opinion that " for 
the reproductive side of his art " Mr. Whistler 
" found in it the most sympathetic and perfect 
medium of all." To this he adds : 

" Great indeed as he was as an etcher, I believe he 
found he could get a far more direct and personal 
expression from lithography than on the copperplate. 
Tones and shadows which he could obtain directly with a 
stump or wash, or a few strokes of the soft chalk, he could 
only obtain in his etchings with an infinite number of 
lines with the needle point, or by a painting of ink upon 
the plate, which latter he of course needed to repeat for 
each impression, and this form of printing he discarded 
before he had finished printing the hundred sets of the 
Venice plates. I know from what he told me that he 
looked upon his lithographs, and especially his later ones, 
as having qualities equal to any of his etchings." 

It is easy to understand why Mr. Whistler 
should have had this feeling. His art is in a 
very special and direct way an art of tone values 
and tone relations. To emphasize these he sacri- 
ficed other qualities, notably at times that of exact 
drawing, though he was a splendid draughtsman 
when he chose to be. Even in his etchings it is 
the tone relations that charm the beholder and 
evoke wonder as well as admiration. 

Although Mr. Way makes no attempt to deal 
with Mr. Whistler's personality, he has not been 
able to omit all reference to his peculiarities. 
Indeed to make no mention of any of these would 
be to rob the portrait of verisimilitude. In all 
mention of them, however, and in the anecdotes 
in which they crop out, they are treated most 
tenderly as things of little weight in our final 
estimate of the man. This attitude is main- 
tained even when relating the incident of Mr. 
Whistler's severance of friendly relations with 
the author and his father, which is told without 
any trace of bitterness or of feeling other than 
deep regret. Such magnanimity is as rare as 
it is commendable. 

A large number of lithographic illustrations 
add to the interest of the book. One of these, 
"Grand Rue, Dieppe," is printed direct from 



Mr. Whistler's original work. The others are 
for the most part reproductions by Mr. Way of 
sketches made by Mr. Whistler in preparation 
for his etchings and paintings, or of memory notes 
of the completed works. There is a very much 
reduced reproduction in color of the " Cremorne 
Gardens" painting; and another of Mr. Way's 
pastel copy of the project for the "Symphony 
in White, No. 4." Charming as the latter is, it 
fails to give an adequate impression of either 
the quality or the beauty of the original 
painting, now in the collection of Mr. Freer ; 
but that is quite beyond the power of any 

reproduction. ^

THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY OF IXSECTS.* 



We are glad to welcome another volume of 
translations from M. Fabre. This time we are 
introduced to the cicada, the mantis, crickets 
and grasshoppers, moths, the bee-hunting wasp, 
and several different beetles. The insects are 
in general similar to those found in this coun- 
try; they are the common species of southern 
France, but common as they are, M. Fabre 
has found out new and wonderful things about 
each one of them. In science, as in literature, 
it is the province of genius to illuminate the 
ordinary. 

Four chapters are devoted to the cigale. It is 
well that the translator did not follow the pop- 
ular error of this country, and call it a " locust "; 
but he might have used the word cicada, which 
is surely by this time part of the English lan- 
guage. The name, however, matters little, since 
very good pictures show the reader what is in- 
tended. M. Fabre begins his account with a 
discussion of the fable about the grasshopper 
and the ant, showing that La Fontaine, know- 
ing nothing of the cicada, changed the old Greek 
version. The Greek story, it appears, probably 
came from India, and it may be that it was not 
even the cicada that begged the ant for food, 
but some other insect. However this may have 
been, M. Fabre objects strongly to the idea of 
the cicada asking favors of the ant, showing that 
as a matter of fact it is the ant which feasts at 
the cicada's table. The cheerful songster is thus 
vindicated, but it is no doubt M. Fabre's little 
joke to take La Fontaine and his predecessors 
so seriously. 

The life history of the cicada is graphically

described, and some of the facts are surprising. 
As everyone knows, the males chant vociferously 
during the short summer of their maturity. 
We have always supposed it a love song, but M. 
Fabre gives reasons for seriously doubting this : 
reasons, indeed, for suspecting that the cicada is 
almost or quite deaf ! This seems ridiculous, but 
who can prove otherwise? Even a gunpowder 
explosion, close by, did not affect their compla- 
cency. Another astonishing thing is that the 
great green grasshopper of Europe, which we 
had imagined to be a strict vegetarian, is in 
fact carnivorous, a ferocious enemy of the 
cicada. 

The next three chapters are devoted to the 
mantis, the greatest of all hypocrites. It is 
this creature, credited from ancient times with 
special sanctity, that shows the most depraved 
appetites it is possible to imagine. The female, 
after marriage, makes a regular practice of 
devouring her unfortunate mate. Two chapters 
now follow which are headed by some strange 
confusion on the part of the translator, "The 
Golden Scarabseus." The insect discussed, and 
well figured, is no scaraba3us at all, but a 
ground beetle, the Carabus auratus. It is sin- 
gular that the translator, who makes some show 
of learning in a variety of footnotes, should have 
overlooked this error. Chapter XX., again, 
is headed " The Gray Cricket," when the insect 
concerned is not a cricket at all, but a grass- 
hopper. Genuine crickets are described in 
another part of the book. There is also strange 
confusion in the charming chapter on the Great 
Peacock Moth, which is indifferently called a 
moth or a butterfly. Thus: "Who does not 
know this superb moth, the largest of all our 
European butterflies, with its livery of chestnut 
velvet and its collar of white fur?" Papillon, 
in French, may mean simply a lepidopterous 
insect, as did undoubtedly the Latin Papilio; 
but in English a moth is not a butterfly. It 
is curious that we have no common term for 
the whole tribe, just as we had no common 
term expressing fraternal relationship independ- 
ent of sex, and Galton was obliged to invent 
"sib." 

Apart from such matters as we have com- 
plained of, which can easily be corrected in a 
second edition, the translation appears to have 
been very well done. The book is certainly 
delightful to read, and does justice to the spirit 
of the author. It will take its place among the 
classics of literature and of science.

RECENT FICTION.* 



It seems that "Richard Dehan," the author of 
that striking novel "The Dop Doctor," is the pen 
name of Miss Clothilde Graves, an Irish dramatist, 
which fact transpires coincidently with the appear- 
ance of her new novel, "Between Two Thieves." 
This is a book not easy to characterize. It is a 
"big" book in both the literal and the figurative 
sense ; it is an intensely emotional book and one ex- 
traordinarily rich in substance ; it is. a book in which 
we seem to see a brilliant light struggling to emerge 
through a fog of verbiage; it is a book loose in 
structure and of feebly coherent interests; it is a 
book that begins with the end, and then, taking a 
fresh start, toilsomely leads up to its beginning 
(which is, to our mind, a most detestable method) ; 
it is a book which resorts, in one instance, to the 
cheap device of telepathy for an effect, and which 
culminates in a chapter of supernatural bathos ; and 
withal it is a romance of fascinating interest and 
impressive power, based essentially upon historical 
material ranging from the period of the great 
Napoleon to that of the "saviour of society" who 
later made a mockery of the Napoleonic name and 
empire. It makes us a participant in the French 
Revolution of 1848, in the crime of December, and 
in all the heroisms and horrors of the Crimean War. 
The main currents of nineteenth century life flow 
through its pages, and an elaborate historical pa- 
geant discloses itself to the view. The figure that 
gives to all these matters whatever unity they possess 
is that of a man, the son of one of Napoleon's mar- 
shals, trained for the army, who sees service at home 
and in Africa, who witnesses the precipitation of 
the Revolution and the accomplishment of the coup 
d'Stat, who as the agent of the imperial adventurer 
makes the plans upon which the Crimean enterprise 
is founded, who learns the true character of his mas- 
ter and renounces him to his face, who is imprisoned 
for his audacity, who when released makes his way 
to the field of war and toils devotedly in the inter- 
ests of humanity, who sins grievously and expiates 
nobly, inspired by the influence of an angel of light 
called Ada Merling in the book (who is in reality 
Florence Nightingale), who carries on the blessed 
work of the Red Cross and devotes his many remain- 
ing years to the cause of peace, and who dies in ex- 
treme old age after receiving all the honors that a 
grateful continent can bestow upon him. In such a

career as this, there is opportunity in abundance for 
creative romantic invention, and for the most part 
the author has used her material worthily. She has 
to deal with black sin and desperate wickedness in 
many phases, but she contrives to make us feel that 
the mantle of divine forgiveness is ample to cover 
the deepest transgression, save in the one case of 
Louis Napoleon, for whom no damnation can be 
sufficiently deep. The book has no finer feature 
than its blistering portraiture of this blackest of his- 
torical criminals, and the view which it gives us of 
that cesspool of social and political corruption known 
ironically to history as the Second Empire. It offers 
a prose parallel to the "Chatiments" of Hugo and 
the " Dirae " of Swinburne. Whole sections of the 
work have been left unhinted at in our description 
the English scenes, including the picture of gar- 
rison life and the scathing study of the army con- 
tractor, and the chapters which describe the hero's 
unsuccessful attempt to claim the succession to a 
German principality. These and other matters must 
be left for the reader to discover, for the book is so 
rich that no review of ordinary length can hope to 
do more than indicate its more important features. 

Of the variety of styles at his command, Mr. J. C. 
Snaith has chosen the frothiest for his service in 
"The Principal Girl." This story of an alliance 
between the peerage and the theatrical profession is 
an engaging example of light comedy in the vein of 
"Araminta." The hero is a young man for whom 
his parents have matured matrimonial plans, which 
he sets at naught by becoming infatuated with a most 
charming Cinderella of the Drury Lane pantomime. 
Expostulations from the pompous father and the 
supercilious mother are of no avail to stay him in his 
mad career, and even the objections of the young 
woman's grandmother a fine representative of ' 
theatrical conservatism who holds the aristocracy of 
the stage a far finer thing than the mushroom crea- 
tions of politics do not prevent the young people 
from following the dictates of their affection. The 
hero is stupid, but good, and he knows exactly what 
he wants. Having an independent fortune, he is 
enabled to contract the mesalliance in defiance of 
all opposition, and it proves to be the best thing in 
the world for him. Recognizing his wife's superior 
intelligence, he is sensible enough to let her manage 
him, and when she decides that he shall go into 
parliament, is content that she should pull the strings 
which bring about his triumphant return. The fact 
that he is a famous hero of the football field aids him 
not a little in his campaign, and he wins the heart 
of his constituency by pledging himself to play with 
the local team upon critical occasions. The wit of 
the story is sparkling, and the world of society and 
politics is touched up with many delicious satirical 
dabs. When twins are produced, even the flinty- 
hearted parents melt, and become reconciled to their 
wayward offspring. 

" The Citadel," by Mr. Samuel Merwin, is called 
" a romance of unrest." The unrest is of the social 
sort which manifests itself in " progressive " politics 



and the tendency to substitute impulse for principle 
in the direction of public affairs. " The Citadel " 
is the structure of constitutional government within 
whose walls so many forms of privileged corruption 
find shelter. Mr. Merwin evidently thinks that the 
only way to destroy these abuses is to tear down 
the walls, which is a procedure too suggestive of the 
famous method of getting roast pig to be taken very 
seriously. John Garwood, the hero of this story, is 
a member of Congress from one of the Illinois dis- 
tricts. He has been sent to Washington by the local 
ring of allied political and business interests, and is 
supposed to be a reliable man. He has become en- 
gaged to the daughter of the chief local magnate, 
thereby offering an important hostage to fortune. 
But acquaintance with the practical side of political 
life fills him with such deep disgust that he resolves 
to become a champion of the people, turning his back 
upon all of his former supporters. Particularly, he 
gets into a state of mind about the federal Constitu- 
tion, which seems to him to block every effort for 
social amelioration, and he emphasizes his new stand 
by making a frenzied attack upon that instrument, 
putting in the forefront of his reform programme an 
amendment designed to make the Constitution more 
easily amendable. His ideal of popular government 
seems to be a system which shall make it possible 
for the majority, at any time, without any pretense 
of deliberation, and without any regard for the ele- 
mentary rights of the minority, to upset any part of 
the law which it does not like. In thus defining 
Garwood's position, we are given his measure so 
clearly that he cannot command the sympathy of 
the sober-minded, although his political conduct is 
praiseworthy enough in its secondary aspects. He 
returns home, severs all his relations with the influ- 
ential men of his district, and engages in a campaign 
for reelection upon a socialist platform. It is a lively 
struggle and arouses a nation-wide interest, but the 
forces arrayed against him are too powerful to be 
overcome, and he is defeated. But he has found an 
Egeria in one of the departments at Washington, 
who has stood at his side during the whole arduous 
campaign, and she saves him from being absolutely 
disconsolate in his overthrow. This book is one of 
many written in similar strain of recent years, which 
overshoot their mark because they unduly magnify 
the evils at which they are directed, and which, in 
the remedies they offer, are simply fatuous, so utterly 
do they disregard the lessons of history and the 
precepts of political wisdom. 

Mr. Holman Day continues to draw material for 
fiction from the woods of northern Maine, and his 
latest novel, "The Red Lane," is the best that he 
has written, having a larger admixture of the roman- 
tic than is to be found in the studies of business and 
politics that he has heretofore given us. His title 
is explained in the opening paragraph of the book. 
"The Red Lane is neither road nor route. It is an 
institution it is smuggling. Its thousand avenues 
are now here, now there." The smuggling that goes 
on over the border that separates Maine from New

Brunswick is of food mutton, potatoes, and oats 
a fact which sheds a particularly clear light upon 
the iniquity of a system which subjects these pro- 
ducts to a customs tax, and rather inclines us to 
sympathy with Mr. Day's chief law-breaker, the 
villain of the story. However, he is bad enough in 
other respects to qualify for his position in the tale, 
and we cheerfully witness the thwarting of his 
schemes and his eventual overthrow. When Evan- 
geline Beaulieu, who has been brought up in a con- 
vent, comes to seek her father in his home, she finds 
him the proprietor of a road-house on the border, 
and hand in glove with the smuggling fraternity. 
She also learns that she herself has been promised 
in marriage to the chief of the smugglers. Being an 
independent and high-spirited young woman, and 
finding her protest against these conditions of no 
avail, she abandons the paternal roof, and starts out 
to make her own way in the world. A suitable hero 
is provided in the person of a United States customs 
officer, who falls in love with the girl, and rescues 
her when she has fallen into the hands of her ene- 
mies, and is about to be made the victim of a forced 
marriage with the hated smuggler. The story has, 
however, a larger interest than is provided by this 
private romance. It is essentially concerned with 
the struggle of the simple Acadian border-folk to 
retain possession of their homes, from which the 
owners of the timber lands seek to evict them. They 
are squatters, it is true, and the law is against them, 
but the author enlists our sympathies in their behalf, 
and we rejoice when the legislature is moved to act 
in their favor. The author understands these peas- 
ant people, their ways of speech and their modes of 
tl linking, and he is at his best in giving expression 
to their character. A particularly delightful episode 
is that which describes the mission of the vagrant 
fiddler to the bishop, sent with a petition for the res- 
toration of their parish priest, who has been arbit- 
rarily taken from them. There are many varieties 
of interest in this narrative, and all are skilfully 
blended into an organic structure. 

" The Midlanders," by Mr. Charles Tenney Jack- 
son, is a narrative of an Iowa river town, with a 
prologue in the bayous of the lower Mississippi. A 
battered human derelict named " Uncle Michigan" 
and an equally battered veteran of the Confederate 
army named " Captain Tinkletoes " (because he 
wears a bell on his wooden leg) live together on a 
" johnboat " in the swamp, and one day add to their 
company a little girl, kidnapped by the former of 
these precious vagabonds from a parade of asylum 
orphans in the streets of New Orleans. Here the 
child lives for several years, when the death of 
" Captain Tinkletoes " breaks up the happy family, 
and " Uncle Michigan," unmooring the old boat, 
takes it on an adventurous voyage up the river. It 
finally becomes stranded by the Iowa town which is 
the principal scene of the story. From this time on, 
the book becomes a study of the social and political 
life of the town in question. Aurelie grows up to 
be a beautiful young woman, and the chief object of 



the affections of two men one the son of a patri- 
cian family, and the other, who is much older, the 
editor of the local country newspaper. As in larger 
communities, there is a good deal of corruption in 
the management of public affairs, and the " leading 
citizens " have matters pretty much in their own 
hands. The editor, who has been doddering along 
in the town for many years, and is not thought to 
be of much account, is pushed into the congressional 
campaign in opposition to the " ring," and the town 
is stirred from its sluggishness in the struggle that 
ensues. Meanwhile Aurelie, whose photograph has 
been sent by the editor to a Chicago newspaper for 
entry in a " beauty contest," becomes the surprised 
recipient of the prize and the victim of all the sensa- 
sional advertising that goes with it. She is promptly 
snapped up by the theatre, and wins a great popular 
success in that hybrid species of entertainment for 
imbeciles known as "musical comedy." This so 
shocks the youth of patrician extraction that he tries 
to put her out of his thoughts, and enters heartily 
into the political campaign, being a candidate for 
the district attorneyship. At the critical moment it 
transpires that Aurelie is the daughter of the editor, 
the fruit of a marriage contracted in the days of his 
reckless youth. The mother has been long dead, and 
of the existence of the child (placed in the New 
Orleans asylum after the mother's death) he had 
never known. His political enemies spring the re- 
velation upon him on the eve of the election, and 
threaten him with exposure if he refuses to with- 
draw. How they are circumvented, how Aurelie 
learns of her father, how he is elected when he be- 
lieves himself out of the running, and how the pat- 
rician youth finds that love is the most important 
thing in the world these things provide the ma- 
terial for a whirlwind finish which leaves nothing 
to be desired in the way of excitement. 

The conquests of science speedily become annexed 
to the domain of the novel-writer. Wireless teleg- 
raphy is an invention which obviously lends itself to 
the planning of startling new situations, and its place 
in the literary workshop is secured. The best of 
the stories which have thus far been based upon this 
device is Mr. Arthur Train's " ' C Q ' ; or, In the 
Wireless House." In this sprightly tale the unities 
of time and space are necessarily observed, for the 
entire story is told within the compass of a two 
weeks' voyage of the Pavonia, and the unity of action 
cannot under these conditions be very much obscured. 
Micky Fitzpatrick, the Marconi operator, is the chief 
figure of the story, and the messages that come to 
him in the wireless house make him acquainted with 
several interesting matters. One of them relates to 
a pearl necklace which a fascinating young woman 
is hoping to smuggle into New York, another relates 
to an embezzler who is sought by the police, and still 
another raises the hue and cry on account of the 
fugitive murderer of the Earl of Roakby. This 
latter message Micky suppresses, and, making the

arranges for the fugitive to slip overboard, and seek 
refuge on a French ship bound for Algiers. The 
other fugitive turns out not to be an embezzler after 
all, but a noble youth who has shouldered his father- 
in-law's guilt, and we are given the intimation that 
he will be cleared in due time. We are left in doubt 
about the necklace, but it supplies the occasion for 
several bits of comedy. We get a good deal of the 
technique of the operator's craft, and the way in 
which he slangs his fellows on the other ships is 
extremely amusing. The narrative is sparkling 
throughout, and abounds in deft characterizations 
and dramatic situations. Our breath is fairly taken 
away by one bit of information which is not dis- 
closed until the final paragraph.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



Charles Lamb's J nn Rickman, statistician and cen- 
friend the sus-taker, secretary to the speaker of 

census-taker. the Houge of Commons for twelve 
syears, clerk at the table of the House for twenty- 
i x, and (chief claim upon our interest and friendly 
regard) valued friend of Charles Lamb during 
much of the latter part of Lamb's life, is made the 
subject of a book that will appeal strongly to all 
lovers of Elia, "Life and Letters of John Rick- 
man" (Houghton), by Mr. Orlo Williams, with a 
portrait of the census-taker and views of the Parlia- 
ment houses and their neighborhood as they were in 
Rickman's time. It was George Dyer that brought 
Lamb and Rickman together, a service to which we 
owe, among other things, the enthusiastic letter from 
Lamb to Manning describing the new friend as "the 
finest fellow to drop in a' nights, about nine or ten 
o'clock cold bread and cheese time just in the 
wishing time of the night, when you wish for some- 
body to come in, without a distinct idea of a probable 
anybody. . . . He is a most pleasant hand; a fine 
rattling fellow, has gone through life laughing at 
solemn apes ; himself hugely literate, oppressively 
full of information in all stuff of conversation, from 
matter of fact to Xenophon and Plato can talk 
Greek with Porson, politics with Thelwall, conjecture 
with George Dyer, nonsense with me, and anything 
with anybody; ..." If that is not enough to 
make anyone eager for a closer acquaintance with 
this genial and accomplished man, it would be useless 
to offer the temptation of further bait. Nevertheless, 
his letters cannot be said to fall into the same class 
with those of Lamb and the other accepted masters 
of the epistolary art. There was in Rickman too 
much of the man of hard facts, of statistics and cur- 
rent politics, to admit of any considerable grace and 
playfulness and airy fancy in his letter- writing. A 
mass of his correspondence has been preserved by a 
grandson of his, and other portions, published and 
unpublished, are elsewhere available; so that with 
the abundant and welcome insertions of comment and 
explanation which Mr. Williams has supplied, a 



substantial volume of interesting matter has been 
produced that not only gives fresh views of Lamb 
and Southey and Coleridge and others of that period, 
but also supplies here and there a more or less im- 
portant fact in Lamb's life or corrects a previous 
error of his biographers. In the ten-page index, 
which seems quite complete in its references, though 
not so "analytical" as might be desired, the half- 
column of Coleridge items is headed "Coleridge, 
Samuel Hartley," by some slip of pen or type. 
Otherwise the marks of care and thoroughness on the 
editor's part are what might have been expected 
from a successor to John Rickman in the exacting 
duties of a House of Commons official, which Mr. 
Williams, on his first page, proclaims himself to be. 

New studies ^ our new books dealing with direct 
of direct legislation attest to the ever-increas- 

legislation. ing i nterest J n tnat subject. Mr. 

Delos F. Wilcox, in his volume entitled "Govern- 
ment by All the People " (Macmillan), deals at length 
in separate chapters with the initiative, referendum, 
and recall, explains what each is, and gives the 
arguments for and against it. A simple list of the 
author's arguments shows that his treatment is not 
exhaustive. For example, to the initiative he finds 
six objections, that it would destroy constitutional 
stability, foster the tyranny of the majority, tend to 
subvert judicial authority, result in unscientific legis- 
lation, lead to radical legislation, and be used by the 
special interests to get the better of the people. In 
its favor he finds four arguments, that it would 
utilize the individual in politics, result in the draft- 
ing of laws by those who wish them to succeed, 
enable the sovereign to enforce its will without the 
consent of the legislature, and provide an orderly 
means of extending or restricting suffrage. These 
arguments, and those on the referendum and recall, 
are very much "in the air," for rarely does Mr. 
Wilcox base them on citations of actual facts. 
The volume on the same subject edited by Mr. 
William Bennett Munro (Appleton) is a collection 
of essays by some of the most distinguished men 
in America, prefaced by a long and carefully pre- 
pared introduction by the editor. This introduction 
and the essays themselves are definite and pointed, 
many references to specific facts being cited in sup- 
port of the positions taken. Altogether, the book 
possesses surprisingly few of the faults common to 
collections of essays written by various writers without 

any thought of their being put together Messrs. 

Edwin M. Bacon and Morrill Wyman, in their 
volume entitled " Direct Elections and Law- Making 
by Popular Vote" (Houghton), seek to cover in one 
hundred and fifty pages the whole field of direct 
elections, popular law-making, the recall, commission 
government, and preferential voting. Even in this 
brief compass the authors have given some valuable 
summaries of what has been done in different places. 
The appendix contains some specimen ballots and a 
comprehensive bibliography. Mr. Samuel Robert-

(Macmillan) is somewhat misleading in its title. 
The author, a native of America residing in England, 
has made a rather unskilful effort to bring before the 
British public the application and results of demo- 
cracy in America. The result is a conglomeration 
consisting of an attempt to prove that Americans (or 
rather the people of New England) are of English 
descent, an explanation of democracy by quotations 
from English statesmen and American constitutions, 
and a history of the referendum in America. That 
a work on popular government should be devoted 
almost wholly to New England is sufficient proof of 
its absurdity. However, this book contains some in- 
teresting facts in regard to the history of the refer- 
endum not elsewhere easily accessible, though in a 
few cases not altogether accurate. 

A unique ^ r ' ^' ^' Goddard's volume entitled 

study in " The Kallikak Family " (Macmillan) 

social heredity. j s a remarkable human document. 
It is a scientific study in human heredity, a convinc- 
ing sociological essay, a contribution to the psycho- 
logical bases of the social structure, a tragedy of 
incompetence, and a sermon with a shocking exam- 
ple as a text. With an endless patience sustained 
by a scientific insight into the value of principle and 
detail, the history of two branches of a family has 
been traced. A common father in Colonial days 
through an illegitimate connection with a nameless 
feeble-minded girl becomes the progenitor of innu- 
merable feeble-minded progeny; later marrying a 
woman of his own class, he becomes the ancestor 
of men and women of the highest respectability, of 
social and professional standing, numbering among 
them high officials, names so worthy that care 
must be taken to prevent their recognition from the 
descriptions given. The good and the bad branches 
of the family have been subjected to about the same 
environment, living in the same part of the country, 
and (though bearing the same name) quite igno- 
rant of their kinship until this study was made. 
No more striking example of the supreme force of 
heredity could be desired. Though its interpretation 
in the details of descent is beset with uncertainty, 
it goes far to assimilate the hereditary trend to that 
termed "Mendelian." Upon this issue Dr. Goddard 
promises another volume based on the slighter study 
of a larger number of defective families. The story 
found its clue in Deborah Kallikak (all the names 
of course are fictitious), an illegitimate and aban- 
doned child who came to the Training School for 
the Feeble-Minded at Vineland. Despite fourteen 
years of teaching and care, she has, at the age of 
twenty-two, the mentality of a ten-year-old child, 
though she has the capacity to acquire a considerable 
range of manual skill. Indeed, placed in favorable 
surroundings, she and her kind would not be recog- 
nized by the public as feeble-minded; for she be- 
longs to the high-grade type of difficult, backward, 
but not unattractive folk. It is precisely in this type, 
especially among girls, that criminality finds its ready 
recruits or victims. Hence the imposing scope of 



the single story, from which so many other stories 
of degeneracy receive a lurid illumination. The prac- 
tical regulation and prevention of this array of inca- 
pacity and worse is the serious social problem. Dr. 
Goddard and his associates have added notably to 
our insight into its fundamental significance, and 
particularly by demonstrating that deficient mental- 
ity the stigma of an unworthy stock is the clue 
to the condition, and vice and crime and inefficiency 
and brutality its issues under present-day social 
stress. 

French society Durin g the cl sin g y ears of his life i 
at the height Professor Achille Luchaire, the great 
of medievalism. French medievalist who died about 
four years ago, was engaged in a study of French 
society during the reign of Philip Augustus (1180 
1223), in which he doubtless intended to include all 
the important phases of civilization at the time when 
mediaevalism stood at the zenith of its course. Death 
prevented the complete realization of this plan, but 
a large part of the work was found in a practically 
finished form among his literary remains, and was 
given prompt publication. Recently an English 
translation of Professor Luchaire's work has been 
prepared by Professor E. B. Krehbiel of Leland 
Stanford University, and has been published under 
the title " Social France at the Time of Philip 
Augustus " (Holt). The work of a master is always 
gladly received ; and in this instance the master has 
drawn an unusual picture. There has recently been 
a tendency among historians to deal more sympa- 
thetically with the middle ages, to dwell less on the 
unlovely characteristics of the time, and to empha- 
size the constructive forces of mediaeval life. But 
the great Frenchman saw the period in a different 
light ; to him the civilization of the middle ages was 
crude and inferior, and he proceeded to tell the 
truth about it. Sombre colors are used throughout 
the work, but particularly dark is the view that he 
gives of the religious and spiritual life of the age ; 
the religion of the masses he finds to have been relic 
worship of the coarsest kind. Naturally the age also 
had its attractive phases, and these, too, are faithfully 
presented. It may be that the writer, who studied 
and wrote during the years of conflict between the 
French government and the Roman church, has over- 
drawn the picture at times, but on the whole the work 
seems honest and convincing. He quotes freely from 
the sources used, and his conclusions seem so well- 
founded that they will not be easily shaken. The 
work also discusses the various secular elements of 
mediaeval society, especially the noble classes; less 
attention is devoted to the peasants and the burghers, 
but this is doubtless due to the fact that the writers 
of the age showed but slight interest in the lower 
classes and have consequently left us less information 
concerning them than we might desire. In his chap- 
ter on " the noble dame," the author takes occasion 
to discuss marriage and divorce in feudal times, and 
concludes that the mediaeval church was utterly un- 
able to enforce its decrees as to the indissolubility of

marriage. That a work of this sort should have lit- 
erary blemishes is inevitable, as the corrections and 
changes of an editor can never take the place of the 
author's own final revision ; but even in its some- 
what imperfect form, the volume does great credit 
to its author, whose works are all of more than 
usual excellence. 

In its outward aspect, "The Heritage 
of Hiroshige"(Paul Elder&Co.) is an 
unusually successful attempt to give a 
Japanese appearance to a book enclosed in substan- 
tial boards and put together strongly enough to stand 
the wear and tear of Western use. It is printed on 
Japanese paper, on one side of the folded sheets, and 
Japanese papers of harmonious tones are used for 
the binding, the result being a very attractive vol- 
ume. The book is the joint production of Mrs. Dora 
Amsden and Mr. John Stewart Happer. The sale 
at Sotheby's in 1909 of Mr. Happer's fine collection 
of Japanese color-prints made his name widely known 
to collectors of these beautiful works of art. One 
section of Mr. Happer's collection consisted entirely 
of prints, by Hiroshige, and in the catalogue he 
announced his discovery of the deciphering of the 
"seal-dates" that appear upon many of the prints. 
This was an important discovery, as it made possible 
the definite determination of the authorship of works 
that had theretofore been attributed arbitrarily to 
the first Hiroshige and to his pupil who afterward 
adopted the same "brush name." Other confirma- 
tory evidence and biographical data made the cata- 
logue an exceptionally useful one for students. This 
material, together with some further items gleaned 
from the prefaces to books of drawings by Hiroshige, 
forms the pith of the present volume. There is a 
chapter of "Biographical Notes," one upon a "Me- 
morial Portrait of Hiroshige" and the "seal-dates," 
one about the "Forewords to Some of Hiroshige's 
Books," and one of "Notes upon Hiroshige's Master- 
pieces." These chapters, all of which contain useful 
information, are, it may be presumed, Mr. Happer's 
contribution to the book. Besides editing it and 
preparing it for the press, Mrs. Amsden has written 
a short introduction, and four chapters of rhapsody 
over the classic art of Japan, which, though well 
meant, seem a bit irrelevant. It is, for example, inter- 
esting to learn that "National art with the Japan- 
ese is the materialization of faith," but it is not easy 
to see what this has to do with Hiroshige. The book 
is illustrated with excellent half-tone reproductions 
of some of Hiroshige's best-known prints and of the 
memorial portrait of him by Kunisada. In an ap- 
pendix some facsimiles of signatures and publishers' 
marks are given, also examples of date-seals and 
several forms of the zodiacal characters that enter 
into the composition of the cycle cyphers. There is, 
besides, a short bibliography of books on Japanese 
art, which would be more useful did it not include 
the titles of utterly worthless books as well as some 
of the best ones that have as yet been written. 



The Mrring "John Hancock, the Picturesque 
American Patriot " is the inviting title of Pro- 

patriot. fessor Lorenzo Sears's attractively- 

presented account of the life and public services of 
him whose bold signature is the first and the best- 
known of the fifty-six appended to the Declaration of 
Independence, and whose other chief claims to re- 
membrance are thus summarized by the author : " He 
was the earliest considerable sufferer from commer- 
cial oppression ; the first aristocrat of Boston to join a 
party which had little property to lose ; one of the 
two whom royal displeasure excluded from pardon ; 
often chairman of liberty meetings ; a member of the 
Great and General Court ; deputy to the Provincial 
Congresses and presiding officer ; also deputy to the 
Continental Congress and for two and a half years 
its President ; the first Governor of the Common- 
wealth of Massachusetts and ten times re-elected." 
Fourteen years ago some selections from Hancock's 
letter-book were edited with explanatory matter by 
Mr. Abram English Brown ; and much earlier than 
that materials for a biography are said to have been 
collected, but to have been sold for a thousand dol- 
lars to some unnamed person interested in suppress- 
ing them. Thus, for whatever mysterious reason, 
no formal biography of Hancock has hitherto ap- 
peared, and Professor Sears enters an untrodden 
domain in his present historical study. His volume, 
of about the size of those in the " American States- 
men" series, is written in a style to win popular 
approval, and gives with sufficient fulness (so far, at 
least, as inadequate records permit) the main facts of 
Hancock's life. The romance of his suit for Dorothy 
Quincy's hand, in the troubled times of outbreaking 
hostilities between England and her American colo- 
nies, is agreeably told ; and the puzzling episode of his 
seeming delinquency as treasurer of Harvard Col- 
lege is unsparingly related. But the brevity of ref- 
erence to the Declaration of Independence is a little 
surprising, in view of the importance of its framing 
and signing in both the history of the nation and the 
public life of Hancock. The closing words of the 
book couple the name of John Hancock with the 
names of Robert Morris and George Washington as 
deserving of highest honors in our tribute to the 
heroes of the Revolution. The familiar Copley por- 
trait is reproduced as appropriate frontispiece to the 
volume, which bears the imprint of Little, Brown, 
&Co.

is courted in his own territory of commonsense. 
We are apparently at the beginning of such a change. 
The latest expression of the recurring romantic 
movement has apparently culminated in pragma- 
tism, and pragmatism has wandered far from real- 
ity. Hence a brilliant group of men on both sides 
of the Atlantic are preaching a return to reality, to 
the world of every day. "The World We Live In; 
or, Philosophy and Life in the Light of Modern 
Thought" (Macmillan), by Professor G. Stuart Ful- 
lerton of Columbia, is a general defence of the new 
phase of thought and a criticism of both the intel- 
lectual idealisms of Berkeley, Bradley, and Royce 
and the newer pragmatism from the realistic stand- 
point. The world, says Professor Fullerton, is not 
existent only in our or God's perception of it, as 
Berkeley taught, nor is it a mere function of an "abso- 
lute"; but it is an objective reality truly presented 
to us though with limitations by our senses. 
Hence the philosophy of the New Realism keeps 
close to facts and sane inductions from them. But 
this system of thought should not be confused with 
the older naturalism. It realizes that there are 
minds as well as bodies in the universe, and it does 
not try to express the reality and operation of these 
minds in terms of chemistry or molecular physics 
as is done by such a thinker as the biologist Jacques 
Loeb in his "mechanistic conception" of life. Pro- 
fessor Fullerton's outline of this philosophy is writ- 
ten in a non-technical manner and with a great effort 
to attain concreteness of exposition by the constant 
use of examples from everyday thought and life. In 
fact he carries this mode of exposition to such length 
that the philosophical reader who happens to hold 
the conceptions Mr. Fullerton criticises will be irrita- 
ted exceedingly by what he will consider a rather 
unfair method of exposition. But the book is writ- 
ten primarily for the plain man; and the world it 
presents, while considerably less fascinating than 
either the pragmatic or idealistic worlds seem to be 
at first blush, yet has an aspect of solid and comfort- 
able reality about it. The New Realism seems re- 
solved to give us a world which is chary of promis- 
ing too much to the enthusiastic soul but which keeps 
the few promises man may exact from it. 

The function and value, in the econ- 
omy of the world, of small nations 
depend upon the maintenance of 
high standards of independent national culture. 
Denmark has long been noted for its unique demo- 
cratic institutions, and no less for the characteristic- 
ally vigorous intellectual and artistic life in its capital. 
The portrayal of society in the literary circles of 
Copenhagen in the early seventies is of especial in- 
terest. It was a brilliant period, though as a nation 
Denmark had for the second time been brutally 
crushed by Germany and was smarting under the 
defeat. The romantic period in literature and 
art was just drawing to a close, Hans Christian 
Andersen was writing his last work, the tragedies 
of Oehlenschlager were still in vogue, the verses

of Paludan-Mtiller were popular, and Galeotti's 
tableaux-ballets continued to dominate the stage at 
the Royal Theatre. The great national movement 
for a native poetry, a native drama, and a native art 
had reached fruition. Bissen's " Landessoldat " had 
succeeded the Psyches and Hebes of the Icelander 
Thorwaldsen in popular esteem, and canvases 
portraying Danish home life were in high favor. 
But a change was impending. BjOrnson's "Newly 
Married Couple " had been enthusiastically received 
at the Royal Theatre, though with misgivings in 
conservative circles. Ibsen had returned to the 
North from Rome somewhat mellowed by the suc- 
cess of " Brand," and the Gyldendalske Boghandel 
was entering upon its wider exploitation of Scandi- 
navian literature. But Copenhagen's coming writer, 
Georg Brandes, was still ostracized by the orthodox 
for his radical views and destructive criticism. 
Mr. Edmund Gosse, in his volume entitled " Two 
Visits to Denmark: 1872, 1874" (Dutton), draws 
from his note-books the youthful impressions which 
this cultivated society of Copenhagen made upon 
him. He wrote with enthusiasm and fulness at the 
time, and the literary portraits sketched in his pages 
have not lost in interest with the passing years. 

Mirthful A & ood book with which the youth- 

tcenesfrom ful reader of Lamb's "Tales from 
Shakespeare. Shakespeare" might follow up his 
study of the great dramatist is offered by Mr. 
William A. Lawson in his " Shakespeare's Wit and 
Humour" (Jacobs), a small volume collecting the 
more enjoyable mirthful scenes that are scattered 
through the plays. Enough of plot and situation is 
in each case indicated by the compiler to give intelli- 
gibility to the extracts. Also an introductory essay 
which young readers will skip, as a rule is sup- 
plied on the general subject of wit and humor as 
illustrated in Shakespeare's pages. No table of con- 
tents or index is provided, to show what plays have 
been drawn upon; but it appears that not many 
more than half of the whole number have furnished 
quotable matter. Curiously enough, the "Comedy 
of Errors " has contributed but a single page, while 
some of the tragedies, notably "Hamlet," have been 
found far richer in wit and humor. If readers, 
young or old, shrink from the unabridged form of 
Shakespeare's plays, such selections as this may do 
them a service by opening their eyes to unsuspected 
treasure. The book is handy in form and the text 
has not been "doctored" except in the way of neces- 
sary omissions, which are indicated by dots. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The current annual report of the City Library of 
Lincoln (Nebraska) gives indication of the further ex- 
tension of the county library system. "At the last ses- 
sion of the legislature a measure was passed providing 
for the establishment of county libraries, also fixing the 
maximum levy for library purposes at three mills on 
the dollar. A number of citizens of this county have

[Oct. 1, 



taken the matter up and are now asking that the mat- 
ter be submitted to the voters of the county at the 
next general election. In the event of its being carried 
and the county library established, some proposition 
will probably be made to this board, looking toward co- 
operation in the management of the two organizations." 

One would hardly say that " A Zola Dictionary " 
satisfies a long-felt want, but for those who need it 
Mr. J. G. Patterson has supplied it. The volume is 
published by the Messrs. Dutton, and is uniform with 
the dictionaries of Dickens, Thackeray, Scott, Meredith, 
Hardy, and Kipling. 

Mr. Henry Frowde publishes an edition of " The 
Rowley Poems of Thomas Chatterton," reprinted from 
Tyrwhitt, and edited by Mr. Maurice Evan Hare. A 
good modern Chatterton has long been needed, and this 
one (in type facsimile) supplies the want. We find in 
the bibliography no mention of Mr. C. E. Russell's work 
one of the most important of recent years. 

The Chautauqua books for home reading during the 
coming year include a reprint of Mrs. Alfred Sidgwick's 
delightful "Home Life in Germany," and three new 
books prepared for this course, as follows : " Social 
Progress in Contemporary Europe," by Mr. Frederic 
Austin Ogg; " Mornings with Masters of Art," by Mr. 
H. H. Powers; and The Spirit of French Letters," by 
Miss Mabell S. C. Smith. 

"The Story of the Ancient Nations," by Professor 
William L. Westermann, is published by the Messrs. 
Appleton in their series of " Twentieth Century Text- 
Books." A great amount of new material for the his- 
tory of the ancient world has come to light of recent 
years probably more than for any other section of 
history and this the author has sought to make avail- 
able for high school uses. He has made an admirable 
text-book, equipped with all the needful apparatus. 

To Professor Walter C. Bronson's four volumes of 
" English Poems," a volume of " American Poems, 
1625-1892 " is now added, published by the University 
of Chicago Press. The volume presents a great quan- 
tity of material in chronological arrangement, and is 
supplied with copious notes and bibliographies. The 
resources of the special collections of Brown University 
have supplied the editor with the best authorities for 
accurate texts, and have made possible the widest range 
of selections. 

"British Poems'," (Scribner), edited by Dr. Percy 
Adams Hutchison, is an anthology of non-dramatic verse 
from Chaucer to Mr. Kipling. It is unburdened by 
notes, and, with few exceptions, the pieces included are 
given in their entirety. The selection seems judicious, 
and the amount of matter presented is considerable 
equalling perhaps the two series of " The Golden Treas- 
ury." Much pains have been taken with the texts, and 
the rich resources of the Harvard library have been at 
the service of the editor. 

A reaction from the present sordid commercialism in 
industrial fields is foretold by Professor Alvin S. John- 
son, of the Economics department of Cornell University, 
in a Phi Beta Kappa address delivered by him at Stan- 
ford University last May, and now issued by the Chapter 
in pamphlet form. It is a hopeful and well-reasoned 
paper. " Much of the power of commercialism," he 
says, " is the product of transitory historical conditions, 
and must pass away." Moral and aesthetic values, no 
less than material ones, are essential to the evolution of 
the industry of the future ; and poetry and philosophy 
and painting will " take their place alongside of indus- 



try in the every-day service of man." Workers in the 
higher fields will have a large part in the new industrial 
development, by furnishing it with standards and ideals. 
" Architects and sculptors, painters and poets, can trans- 
form social man and society into values capable of dom- 
inating industry." Professor Johnson's paper is so 
inspiring and suggestive that it might well be elaborated 
into a volume. 

In connection with the seventy-fifth anniversary of 
the founding of the Mount Holyoke College there has 
been published at the Riverside Press " A Mount Hol- 
yoke Book of Prose and Verse," edited by Miss E. C. 
Porter and Miss F. L. Warner. It is a selection from 
undergraduate manuscript of the past twenty odd years 
and " was undertaken to show the best of what Mount 
Holyoke girls have written." The editors add: "Once 
the manuscript was got together it proved to be a far 
more interesting thing, a sort of footnote to college his- 
tory, alive with the successive interests of the different 
years and shaped as the college has been shaped." The 
volume is pleasant reading and creditable to the methods 
and ideals of the school from which it comes. 

A copy of " Newark in the Public Schools of 
Newark," by Mr. J. Wilmer Kennedy, Assistant Super- 
intendent of Schools, has come to us, and deserves hearty 
commendation for its combined instructiveness and read- 
ability. It is described on the title-page as " a course 
of study on Newark, its geography, civics and history, 
with biographical sketches and a reference index." Nu- 
merous illustrations are inserted, and the whole makes 
an attractive volume of more than two hundred pages. 
Especially interesting to general readers is the section 
devoted to " Literary Landmarks of Newark," a chap- 
ter richer in distinguished names and precious associa- 
tions than many would have suspected. Newark appears 
to be the leader, and a most energetic one, in introduc- 
ing into its public schools this thorough and systematic 
study of its own history, topography, and institutions. 
A pamphlet by the Newark librarian, Mr. John Cotton 
Dana, on " The Study of a City in the Schools of that 
City," reprinted from " The Pedagogical Seminary," 
gives significant facts and details regarding this praise- 
worthy movement on the part of the Newark educators, 
a movement in which we surmise Mr. Dana himself has 
played no unimportant part. 

The second volume of Lescarbot's " History of New 
France," as reprinted by the Champlain Society of 
Toronto, with the original text, an English translation, 
and notes and appendices by Professor W. L. Grant of 
Queen's University, Kingston, Canada, contains Books 
III. and IV. of the History, describing the voyages of 
Jacques Cartier, Roberval, La Roche, and Champlain 
to the Gulf and River St. Lawrence; and those of 
De Nonts and Poutrincourt to the Bay of Fundy. As 
Lescarbot himself was a member of the expedition of 
1606, and took an active part in all the affairs of the 
little settlement at Port Royal, the Fourth Book of his 
History is of particular interest. He not only gives us, 
from personal knowledge, the romantic story of this 
pioneer settlement in what now constitutes the Maritime 
Provinces of Canada, but he adds many characteristically 
shrewd and acute comments on the character of his 
companions, and of Membertou, sagamore of the Mic- 
macs, and his savage allies. Professor Grant's discrimi- 
nating editorial work, which formed so admirable a 
feature of the first volume, is equally praiseworthy here. 
Volume III., completing the History, is expected to be 
published before the closing of the year.

.NOTES. 



" Types of Men " is the title of Mr. G. K. Chesterton's 
new volume of essays, soon to be published by Messrs. 
Dodd, Mead & Co. 

Another of Mr. Hilaire Belloc's entertaining collec- 
tions of essays will appear shortly under the title, " This 
and That and the Other." 

"The Sea Trader: His Friends and Enemies," by 
Mr. David Hannay, is a forthcoming publication, not 
previously announced, of Messrs. Little, Brown & Co.'s. 

Miss Mary E. Waller's A Daughter of the Rich " 
will appear shortly in both Norwegian and Danish trans- 
lations, from the publishing house of Cammermeyers, 
Christiana. 

Miss Anna Preston, a young Canadian writer, is the 
author of The Record of a Silent Life," purporting to 
be the autobiography of a woman born dumb, which Mr. 
B. W. Huebsch will publish this month. 

Mrs. Frances Kinsley Hutchinson, author of " Our 
Country Home," has written a supplementary volume 
entitled " Our Country Life," to be published shortly 
with numerous illustrations by Messrs. A. C. McClurg 
& Co. 

Two additions to Messrs. Holt's autumn list are the 
following: "Trails, Trappers, and Tenderfeet," an ac- 
count of adventure in the Canadian Northwest, by Mr. 
Stanley Washburn ; and " My Dog and I," written and 
illustrated by Mr. Gerald Sidney. 

" Uriel and Other Poems of Commemoration," by 
Mr. Percy MacKaye, is announced by Messrs. Houghton 
Mifflin Co. Two other volumes of verse to be issued 
during the autumn by the same publishers are " Villa 
Mirafiore "by Mr. Frederic Crowninshield, and "Poems 
by Frederic and Mary Palmer." 

We are glad to note that the two fine addresses on 
Charles Eliot Norton, by Dr. Edward W. Emerson and 
Mr. William F. Harrison, originally delivered before 
the Archaeological Institute of America and later pub- 
lished in the Bulletin of that society, are soon to be re- 
printed in book form by Messrs. Houghton Mifflin Co. 

A volume of poems of the great Magyar poet Alex- 
ander Petofi will be published immediately by the 
Hungarian Literary Society of New York City. The 
translator is Mr. William N. Loew and the proceeds of 
the sale of the volume will be dovoted to a fund for a 
statue of Petofi to be erected by the Hungarians of 
New York City in one of the city's parks. 

A new work by Mr. Frederic Harrison, on " The 
Positive Evolution of Religion," will appear shortly. 
Mr. Harrison here attempts a systematic study of the 
entire religious problem. Beginning with Nature Wor- 
ship, and going on to Polytheism, Catholicism, Protest- 
antism, and Deism, he estimates the moral and social 
reaction of the various forms which religious belief has 
assumed. 

Some forthcoming English biographical works of 
importance, not yet announced on this side, include a 
Life of Walter Bagehot, by Mrs. Russell Barrington; 
" Our Book of Memories," by Mrs. Campbell Praed 
and the late Justin McCarthy; a volume of " Further 
Reminiscences of H. M. Hyndman," dealing with his 
life since 1889; and "My Own Times," a new volume 
of Lady Dorothy Nevill's delightful gossip. 

" Men, Women, and Minxes " is the title of a miscel- 
lany of biographical and other sketches, written by 
Mrs. Andrew Lang, and to be published next month by 



Messrs. Longmans. The contents are varied and attract- 
ive, among the topics being "The Fairchild Family 
and their Creator," " Morals and Manners in Richard- 
son," "Pitfalls for Collectors," "Two Centuries of 
American Women," and "Poets as Landscape Painters." 

A monthly journal devoted to the cause of Philippine 
independence has recently been established under the 
editorship of Hon. Manuel L. Quezon, Resident Com- 
missioner from the Philippines. " The Filipino People," 
as the new publication is called, will aim to give the 
American people authoritative information about this 
vitally important public question a question usually 
ignored or misrepresented in our own press. Its pub- 
lication office is in Washington. 

An important autumn publication, not previously 
announced, is a translation from the Swedish of Gustaf 
Janson's " Lognerna," to be published by Messrs. Little, 
Brown & Co. uuder the title, Pride of War." While 
dealing specifically with the Turko-Italian war in Tripoli, 
it forms an indictment of war in general which, judging 
from the comments and quotations of English reviewers, 
must be even more powerful and convincing than the 
Baroness von Suttner's famous novel, " Ground Arms ! " 

Spenser, Coleridge, Lowell, and Browning's "The 
Ring and the Book " are about to be added to the Ox- 
ford Poets, which will be further enriched by a volume 
of the collected works of a living poet Mr. Robert 
Bridges. All these will also be issued in the cheaper 
" Oxford Standard Classics," and in this series will ap- 
pear Kingsley's " Hereward the Wake," Adam Lindsay 
Gordon's poems, and " The Pageant of English Prose," 
edited with notes by Mr. R. M. Leonard, who compiled 
the companion volume " The Pageant of English 
Poetry." 

A notable group of books dealing with various phases 
of the current feminist movement will constitute an 
important feature of the autumn publishing season. 
The titles and authors of these books are as follows: 
" The Woman Movement," translated from the Swedish 
of Ellen Key; "The Business of Being a Woman," by 
Miss Ida M. Tarbell; " Why Women Are So," by Mrs. 
Mary Roberts Coolidge ; " Woman in the Making of 
America," by Mr. H. Addington Bruce; "Woman in 
Modern Society," by Professor Earl Barnes; "The 
Advance of Women," by Mrs. Johnstone Christie; and 
" Women in Italy," by Mr. W. B. Boulton. 

The second annual meeting of the National Council 
of Teachers of English will be held in Chicago, November 
28, 1912. The principal topics to be discussed are as 
follows: Grammatical Nomenclature, Types of Organi- 
zation of High School English, Books for Voluntary 
Reading, Dramatic Work, Material Equipment, Oral 
Composition in College, Relation of Public Speaking to 
other Exercises, Relation of Grammar and Composition, 
Required English Courses in Normal Schools. Action 
will be taken with regard to a national syllabus and with 
regard to measures for relieving teachers who are over- 
burdened with written work. The Council has eight 
committees at work, all of which are national in scope, 
and the meeting will bring together the leaders in 
English teaching, in both school and college, from all 
sections. 

"The Century Magazine " has in preparation a series 
of " after-the-war " articles, dealing with great events 
in American progress during the half-century following 
the Civil War. This series will begin in the Novem- 
ber number of the magazine with a narrative of " The 



252 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



Humor and Tragedy of the Greeley Campaign," by 
Colonel Henry Watterson, editor of the Louisville 
"Courier-Journal." Following articles in the series 
will deal with the cause of Andrew Johnson's impeach- 
ment, Cleveland's triumph over Elaine, " the aftermath 
of reconstruction," " Uncle Sam's bargain in Alaska," 
the return to hard money, etc., etc., and the contribu- 
tors will include General Harrison Gray Otis of the Los 
Angeles " Times," Mr. Melville E. Stone of the Asso- 
ciated Press, Mr. Clark Howell of the Atlanta " Con- 
stitution," Mr. Charles A. Conant, formerly of the New 
York " Journal of Commerce," and other equally well- 
known authorities. 

About the first of this month Professor Eugen Kiih- 
nemann of Breslau, Carl Schurz Professor at the Uni- 
versity of Wisconsin, will begin lecturing at Madison, 
holding two regular courses (one on Goethe's " Faust," 
the other on " Modern German Drama "), and conduct- 
ing exercises in literary criticism for advanced students. 
Professor Kiihnemann has visited America several times, 
and has made a particularly vivid impression as an elo- 
quent orator, as well as a stimulating thinker. Occupy- 
ing the chair of philosophy at Breslau, he has paid 
especial attention to the relations between philosophy 
and literature, and the bearing of literature upon the 
cultural problems of the race. His biography of Herder 
and his work upon Schiller are written from this point 
of view. During his term of work at Madison he will 
lecture at Milwaukee and elsewhere in the state, and 
will also speak at some of the other important centres of 
the middle west. In February he expects to visit the 
Pacific coast. 

Among the works of general interest appearing on 
the revised announcement list of the Oxford Univer- 
sity Press, besides those noted in our last issue, are the 
following: "Four Stages of Greek Religion," by Dr. 
Gilbert Murray ; " French Classical Drama," by Miss 
Eleanor Jourdain; "Keble's Lectures on Poetry," trans- 
lated by Mr. E. K. Francis; Med win's Life of Shelley, 
edited, with introduction and notes, by Mr. H. Buxton 
Forman ; " The Oxford Book of Latin Verse," chosen 
and edited by Mr. H. W. Garrod; "The Science of 
Etymology," by Dr. W. W. Skeat; "Essays and Studies 
by Members of the English Association," Vol. III., 
collected by Dr. W. P. Ker; "A Companion to Roman 
History," by Mr. H. Stuart Jones; "The Ability to 
Converse," by Mr. S. M. Bligh; " A Concordance to 
Petrarch," by Mr. K. Mackenzie ; " A Concordance to 
Dante's Latin Works," by Messrs. E. K. Rand and E. H. 
Wilkins; " The Works of George Savile, Marquess of 
Halifax," edited by Sir Walter Raleigh; "The Poems 
and Masks of Aurelian Townshend," edited by Mr. E. 
K. Chambers; and, in the " Oxford Library of Prose 
and Poetry," Morgann's " Essay on the Character of 
.Sir John Falstaff," with Introduction by W. A. Gill, 
"Tosa Nikki: The Diary of a Japanese Nobleman 
Written in 935," translated by W. N. Porter, and a 
verbatim reprint of the 1842 edition of Tennyson's 
Poems.

ers dancing only in so far as it can be taken seriously as an art. 
He writes critically of the various kinds of dancing the rise 
and fall of the ballet, skirt dancing, serpentine dancing, etc.

The Flowing Road 

Adventuring on the Great Rivers of South America 
By CASPAR WHITNEY 

Mr. Whitney has gathered in this volume the experiences of five separate overland and river expeditions into the heart of 
South America, beginning in 1902. Largely these were by canoe and chiefly on streams more or less connected. hence 
the significance of the title " The Flowing Road." Two of the author's most prolonged journeys were taken with the object 
of visiting savage and unknown natives in the southeastern corner of Venezuela. There are startling adventures with 
animals of various kinds and the author's trip alone with one of the natives, to reach the unknown land at the head of the 
Orinoco through the midst of hostile Indians and almost impassable natural barriers, is a chapter in travel adventure which 
has rarely been equalled. There is a chapter devoted entirely to the subject of preparation for travelling in tropical regions 
with directions as to clothing, cooking utensils, food. etc.

Our English Cathedrals 

By the REV. JAMES SIBREE

ing manner. The volumes are based on half a century's 
study of English ecclesiastical architecture.

Empress Josephine by the Duke of Reichstadt. He also 
undertakes the recital of incidents which marked the life of 
Napoleon's first wife.

An American Glossary 



Being an Attempt to Illustrate Certain Americanisms Upon Historical Principle* 
By RICHARD H. THORNTON 

Of the Philadelphia Bar; Law Professor in the University of Oregon, 1886-1005 

This invaluable work contains more than 13.000 quotations arranged according to their dates. No attempt is made to 
register the voluminous outpouring of modern slang, but it includes some modern slang expressions which are too character- 
istic to be left out ; also others belonging to the period of the hunter and the backwoodsman. This important work fills a 
particular need, as at the present time there is no dictionary of Americanisms compiled upon historical principles.

EDITED BY His SON. 

Two volumes. With portraits. Svo. $4.00 we; % mail $4.38. 

THE LETTEKS OF GEORGE MEREDITH, which have been in process 
of selection and preparation since his death in 1909, will be found 
one of the most varied, interesting, and revealing of such autobiog- 
raphical collections. They extend over some fifty years, beginning 
except for a few scattered notes from his boyhood about 1858, when 
Meredith was thirty years old, and after his first marriage. Among 
his correspondents are included his life-long friends, John Morley 
(Lord Morley), Admiral Maxse, another of his most intimate associ- 
ates; Frederick Greenwood, Chapman the publisher, Leslie Stephen, 
Robert Louis Stevenson, Trevelyan, and many others, besides a group 
of family friends and some of the members of his own household. 
The collection is not intended to supply a narrative of his life, nor 
would it do so, in spite of its extent; but it gives an unsurpassed 
reflection of temperament and character, of personal relations, of 
opinions, and even of moods, for Meredith excelled in all the good 
qualities of a letter-writer. 



Poetical Works of George Meredith 

With some notes by G. M. TREVELYAN. 
With portrait. $2.00 net; by mail $2.19. 

GEORGE MEREDITH was one of the great 
poets in the succession of English poetic 
masters. It is therefore right that all of 
his poetry should be made available in 
one volume by which his eminence can be 
appreciated and judged. Founded on the 
carefully revised text of the Memorial Edi- 
tion (in which the poetry fills three large 
volumes) this is an impressive volume 
containing more than six hundred pages. 
Mr. Trevelyan, who wrote during the au- 
thor's lifetime "THE PHILOSOPHY AND 
POETRY OF GEORGE MEREDITH," which 
is referred to in Meredith's recently pub- 
lished Letters, has added some illuminating 

notes to the poems. The volume is the standard definitive edition 

of Meredith as a poet.

The Rosary 



By FLORENCE L. BARCLAY 
A Christinas Story for All the Year Round. Crown 8vo. Frontispiece in color. 

$1.00 net. By mail, $1.10. 

The story deals with a successful author, a man, young and attractive, whose absorption in his work 
leads him into unconscious selfishness towards his devoted wife. The Upas Tree symbolizes this selfishness. 
The book has a strong love interest and contains many tender passages. It is a story of rare charm, 
powerful in conception, compelling in narrative, wholesome in effect.

This charming book reflects the characteristics of the writer; the same vivid imagination, the quick tran- 
sition from pathos to humor, the facility of utterance, the wholesome sentiment, the purity of thought, the 
delicacy of touch, the spontaneous wit which has endeared her to over a million readers, are here freely 
represented.

With the Merry Austrians 

Second Printing. $1.25 net. By mail, $1.40. 

For the setting of this charming love story Miss McLaren takes the reader to the Austrian Tyrol, but her 
touch is no less sure, her local color no less faithful, and her story no less fascinating than when she is 
weaving romance about her northern countrymen and the heaths of Scotland. A delightful vein of humor 
runs sparkling through the volume and many a long chuckle is vouchsafed the reader.

From the purchase made by the Dutch from the Indians in 1639 to the present day. 

By STEPHEN JENKINS 
Author of "The Greatest Street in the World Broadway." 8vo. With over 100 illustrations and maps, 

$3.50 net; by mail, $3.75. 

The romantic history of the northern section of Greater New York from the days of Jonas Bronk, after whom the 
Bronx was named, through the centuries crowded with events that have issued into the present. The geographical 
landmarks acquire a new significance as around them this accurate historian of local events and conditions weaves 
the substantial fabric of fact and more sparingly the lighter web of tradition.

MILAN MODENA FERRARO RIMINI ASSISI 
PAVIA BOLOGNA RAVENNA URBINO 
SPELLO MONTEFALCO SPOLETO ORVIETO 
VITERBO PESARO PIACUZO PERUGIA, ETC. 

These little sketches will open new and charming fields of 
interest. M. Maurel has wandered from town to town, 
painting in vivid colors his impressions of their historical 
and artistic aspects, showing with keen insight how closely 
allied are these, what each owes to the other, and how in- 
debted is the present to both.

"Bushida." Crown 8vo. $1.50 net; by mail. $1.65. 
A thorough study of Japan by one of her foremost scholars. 
It is one of the very few existing accounts of this much mis- 
understood nation. The book is thoroughly vital, infused 
with thought, brilliant in style, and should prove service- 
able to all who want to arrive at a true impression of the 
Japanese people. 



The Hoosac Valley Its Legends and Its History 

By GRACE GREYLOCK NILES 

8vo. With 110 illustrations and maps. $3.50 net ; by mail, $3.75. 

The early history of the Hoosac Valley is inextricably interwoven with that of the very foundation of our Great 
Republic. Miss Niles's purpose is not to furnish new pages for history, but rather to present the story of beginnings 
in historic Hoosac in its true relation to the world's great history. A mass of legendary material hitherto uncollected, 
together with profuse illustrations of Revolutionary heroes and historic fields, combine to make the volume valuable 
and attractive, not only to the residents of the Hoosac and Wallomsac country, but to all students of American history. 



Thy Rod and Thy Staff 

By ARTHUR CHRISTOPHER BENSON 

Author of "The College Window." $1.50 net; by mail, $1.65. 
" Once more Mr. Benson has put forth one of his appealing 
and eloquent studies in human motive ; and once more, he 
has succeeded, with unfailing certainty of touch, in getting 
out of his study a remarkable and impressive effect." 

In the last of his books, which dealt with personal experi- 
ences, " The Silent Isle," the author promised the reader 
that he would some day tell how it was that the pleasant 
design that he had set for himself failed. The present book 
is the fulfilment of that promise.

of military achievement.

BROWNING: POCKET EDITION 



Edited by CHARLOTTE PORTER and HELEN A. CLARKE. 
Introduction by Professor WILLIAM LYON PHELPS. Photogravure 
frontispieces. Set of 12 volumes, cloth, $12.00. Leather, $18.00. 
Volumes sold separately, in cloth at $1.00, and in leather at $1.50 
per volume. 

The large type "Pocket Edition" of the works of Robert Browning 
includes the complete output in verse of the great poet, as well as two essays 
in prose, and presents this matter in a form that leaves nothing to be desired 
by the most devoted Browning-lover. By the use of Bible paper the volumes 
have been made of compact size, delightfully easy to handle, and at the same 
time the type in which both text and bibliographical matter are set is large 
and clear, making restful, easy reading. The editors, Miss Porter and Miss 
Clarke, are two of the best-equipped students of Browning in this country 
or Europe. Their introductions and notes are full and scholarly, and, taken 
as a whole, shed all the light to be desired on the poet and his works. A 
valuable feature is the terse, clear digest given of every poem. A general 
introduction to the edition has been written by William Lyon Phelps, Profes- 
sor of English Literature at Yale University. The excellence of the editorial 
work, the handsome appearance of the text, and the general attractiveness of 
the volumes as masterpieces of skilful book-making unite to make this the 
ideal edition of Browning's works.

fessor of History in Yale College. Author of " CIVILIZATION DURING THE MIDDLE AGES." 

This volume, but just published, is a very timely and authoritative contribution to one of the most ab- 
sorbing of all historical studies.

Middle Ages better than the author of this volume. . . . The work is thorough, and will be appreciated 
by students." Boston Transcript.

THE PRESIDENT'S CABINET. STUDIES IN THE ORIGIN, FORMATION AND STRUCTURE OF 
AN AMERICAN INSTITUTION. By HENRY BARRETT LEARNED. 

"Mr. Learned has completed a work of profound research in a domain which is little frequented by his- 
torical scholars, and the result is a manual likely to be referred to as an authority. Constitutional history 
has here received a valuable contribution to its clearness and completeness and the work will bo welcomed and 
valued by specialists." The Literary Digest. 

"The book is a welcome and valuable addition to American historical literature." -Ycso York Tribune.

I ITFRATIIRF THE YALE BOOK OF AMERICAN VERSE. By THOMAS R. LOUNSBURY, LL.D., L.H.D., 

LI I CRH I URL Professor of English Emeritus, Yale University. 

This anthology is a chronologically arranged collection of poems by American authors, excluding the 
work of any living writer. The Editor has made a catholic yet discriminating selection, including specimens 
of all kinds of poetry, the serious as well as the light, the contemplative, the pathetic, the humorous, and the 
satiric. Not even have the travesty and vers de society been omitted. Lyrics inspired by the Civil War, as 
well as the National hymns, find their place in the collection. 

Professor Lounsbury, whose commanding position in American letters peculiarly fits him for the onerous 
task of editorship, has brought wide and accurate reading to his labors, and as far as practicable has followed 
in each case the author's latest revised text. 

A delightful introduction of over fifty pages states the viewpoint of the Editor in regard to anthologies 
with a wit which charms and a reasonableness which disarms criticism. 

All who have read anything of Professor Lounsbury's will desire this book for the sake of his Introduction, 
whether or not they are interested in anthologies in general.

ENGLISH LYRICAL POETRY. FROM ITS ORIGINS TO THE PRESENT TIME. By EDWARD 
BLISS REED, Assistant Professor of English, Yale University. 

This is the first history of the English Lyric which has yet appeared nnd is the outgrowth of a series of 
lectures which have been delivered at Yale University during the last decade. It is not only valuable as a work 
of reference, but is particularly adapted for use in classrooms. 

"Professor Reed has brought to his task the necessary knowledge of the scholar and student of litera- 
ture, and what is much rarer taste, judgment and a broad perspective. 

"It is for his scholarly but far from pedantic treatment of the earlier phases of English Lyrical Poetry 
that Professor Reed's book will be especially valued." The Athenaeum. 

"It is a survey which will interest almost any person who loves good literature." Philadelphia Enquirer. 

"An agreeable and valuable reference book containing as it does biographical notes and critical comments." 
Springfield Republican. 

8vo. Cloth binding. Gilt top. 616 pages. Price $2.25 net; postage, 20 cents extra. 

THE MEANING OF GOD IN HUMAN EXPERIENCE. A PHILOSOPHIC STUDY OF 
RELIGION. By WILLIAM ERNEST HOCKING, PH.D., Assistant Professor of Philosophy in 
Yale University. 

This important work begins with a survey of religion as seen in its effects in history and in personality, 
opening the question whether religion is chiefly a matter of feeling or of thought. The author discusses James, 
Bergson, Ho'ffdiug, and other thinkers, working out a striking theory of the- relation between ideas and feel- 
ings in consciousness. Professor Hocking has been singularly fair to the various important trends of philosophic 
thought. The book is readable, serious, original, and thoughtful, and has already secured high praise from 
leading philosophic thinkers of the day. 

Crown 8vo. Cloth binding. Gilt top. 586 pages. Index. Price $3.00 net; postage, 28 cents extra. 

GREEK REFINEMENTS. By WILLIAM H. GOODYEAR, M.A., Curator of Fine Arts, Brooklyn, 
Institute of A rts and Sciences, Brooklyn, New York. 

The aim of the present elaborate and beautiful work is to summarize for architects, art students, and 
for those who are interested in the history of Greek civilization, the notable discoveries of all observers of archi- 
tectural refinements in Greek temples. The author, who enjoys an international reputation because of his own 
great discoveries in this field, is eminently qualified to write on the subject. The non-technical treatment and 
many beautiful illustrations render the work of absorbing interest to those of the general reading public who 
seek a knowledge of the principles of architectural taste. The edition is strictly limited to seven hundred and 
fifty copies printed from type.

The Americans In Panama" 



By WILLIAM R. SCOTT 



$1.35 net; $1 .45 postpaid 



THE PANAMA CANAL, the world's greatest enterprise, is more than 90 per cent 
completed. It is now possible to take a perspective view of the project, and "The 
Americans In Panama" is such a treatment. The author is a newspaper man who spent 
five months studying the canal, working three months as a canal employee to insure 
accuracy of visualization. 

Between 15,000 and 20,000 Americans will visit the canal this year, the last time it 
may be seen in course of construction, as the first ship is scheduled to pass through in 
September, 1913. If you expect to go, two things should be done at once. Secure your 
steamer reservation and buy a copy of "The Americans In Panama." It will qualify 
you to get the maximum instruction and pleasure out of your trip. From the beginning of 
Panama's history in 1501 to the latest developments on the canal there is not an essential 
fact omitted or a superfluous one retained. Discusses competently the Monroe doctrine, 
the controversy with England, and Colombia's claim for the loss of Panama. 

If you are one of the 89,900,000 Americans who will not see the canal in the building, 
" The Americans In Panama" is ideally the book to purchase and read and to add to your 
library. It is a sign of culture to be accurately informed on current subjects of vital inter- 
est. "The Americans In Panama" is authoritative, succinct, and non-technical. It is

AMERICAN POEMS 

Selected and Edited, with Illustrative and Explanatory Notes and a Bibliography 
'By WALTER C. BRONSON, Litt.D., Professor of English Literature, "Brown University 

BY all students and teachers of English, the announcement of Professor Bronson's new 
work, American Poems, will be received with interest. The wide recognition of the 
merit of his English Poems is of itself a guaranty of the appreciation which this author's 
work merits. In a volume of 680 pages the author has assembled a representative collection 
of the best work of American poets covering the period 1625-1892. The selection in each 
case has been governed by scholarly discrimination, and is designed to show the individual, 
representative work of each poet. 

The poetry of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and the minor poetry of the 
nineteenth century are included, although more than half the space is given to the greater 
poets. The broad view thus afforded of the entire field of American poetry will help the 
student to an understanding of American life from the earliest colonial times and to a juster 
appreciation of the greater nineteenth-century poets.

A BOOK THAT HAS BEEN LONG WAITED FOR 



THE MODERN READER'S CHAUCER 
The Complete Poetical Works of 

GEOFFREY CHAUCER 

Now first put into Modern English by 
JOHN S. P. TATLOCK PERCY MAC KAYE 

Author of AND Author of 

"The Development and Chronology "The Canterbury Pilgrims," 

of Chaucer's Works " "Jeanne d'Arc," etc. 

Illustrated by 32 full-page quadri color plates from paintings by the celebrated 
English artist, WARWICK GOBLE. 

Chaucer's entire works have never before been put into Modern English. 

Fugitive fragments retold in prose and verse by Pope, Dryden, Wordsworth, and others of 
lesser fame exist, but the wit, beauty, and wealth of this great English poet is practically unknown 
to the modern reader. 

This condition is now removed by this work in which the editors specialists in their knowl- 
edge of CHAUCER adhering closely to the original have rendered into modern English all the 
wonderful tales of this early poet. 

The editors have kept as much of Chaucer's raciness and archaic savor as is consistent with 
the reader's ease, and have been strictly faithful to the original, paraphrasing as little as possible, 
and never misrepresenting. 

It is believed, therefore, that the present volume will be welcomed by a great number of 
cultured people everywhere, who, desirous of becoming fully acquainted with this classic English 
poet, but unversed in Old English, have experienced difficulty in reading Chaucer in the original.

THE CAUSE. 
11 It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul." 

The Cause is looking up. It is being advo- 
cated in the Fiji Islands, and has won the 
adherence of Mr. R. H. Williams of Beacon 
(significant name!), Iowa, of Mr. D. W. La 
Rue of East Stroudsberg, Pennsylvania, and of 
several other doubtless equally estimable per- 
sons. We gather these interesting and hopeful 
facts from the last number of the " Simplified 
Spelling Bulletin," which is the official organ 
of the Cause, and which will be sent regularly 
to any address for an annual subscription of ten 
cents. Another cheering announcement is that 
the Chicago Numismatic Society has seen the 
light a flash-light, in this case, which took a 
"fotograf " of the numismatists assembled at a 
banquet, where the menu provided them with 
roast spring "lam" and "mince sauce." Of 
even more thrilling interest is the announcement 
that a student at Columbia University in the 
department of chemistry has published his doc- 
toral dissertation in simplified spelling. His 
subject is "Derivativs of 4-Hydroxy-5-Nitro- 
Quinazoline," which seems to us a fairly harm- 
less application of the reform. 

The author of the above diverting essay may 
be as yet unknown to fame, but that cannot be 
said of Sir William Ramsay, who is, we believe, 
now in Texas as a foreign representative of 
"siens" at the inaugural ceremonies of the Rice 
Institute. He has recently, it seems, addressed 
himself to the readers of an English educational 
journal in the following cabalistic terms : "Let 
every teecher hu reedz theez lienz ov mien tri 
and convins herself hou eezy iz this nyu speling. 
... It is the jeneraishonz ov children tu cum 
hu apeel tu us tu saiv them from the aflicshon 
which we hav endyuerd and forgoten." We like 
particularly that weird word "jeneraishonz," 
which must be a joy forever to anyone who can 
remember how to spell it. But as we scan this 
brief quotation of forty-three words, of which 
nearly two- thirds are unknown to the dictionary, 
and try to read it aloud, giving the letters the 
values that we instinctively attach to them, we 
discover that just one-half of the deformed 
spellings indicate a pronunciation which is dis- 
tinctly not that of the cultivated user of the 
English language. For example, how does 



276 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



the writer reconcile his "siens," "lienz," and 
"mien"? And how are his readers to know 
that the initial vowels in "apeel" and "aflic- 
shon" are short? The Cause is welcome to 
these phonetic vagaries, but they do not exactly 
commend it to the judicious. 

Elsewhere, Sir William Ramsay is quoted as 
saying : " It is objected that with the new sys- 
tem people would not all spell the same way. 
But does it really matter so long as what is 
written is understandable ? " We should think 
"decipherable" a better adjective, but let that 
pass. The result at which Sir William hints 
is amplified in the leading article of the " Bul- 
letin," which opens as follows : " One of the 
delites of a modernized English spelling will be 
the new era of discovery that it will open to the 
readers of letters and books. They will often 
find out, for the first time in their lives, how 
the writers whose books they read, and how 
their correspondents whose voices they have 
not heard, pronounce their words. At present 
readers have to (jess how the authors pronounce. 
No doubt they gess correctly, in- most cases ; but 
they do not know" The writer of this aston- 
ishing plea says truly, later on, that " a vista 
is opend." " O, vistas infinite unfold ! " says 
Brand to the Dean, who is expounding to him 
the true philosophy of religion. Hitherto, we 
have left this sort of license to the amateurs of 
dialect, who have alternately bored and puzzled 
us to the limit of endurance, but we have not 
had to read them. In the good time coming, it 
seems, everybody who writes will devise for his 
words spellings ad hoc, in accordance with some 
occult phonetic system of his own. By way of 
illustrating the nice derangement of epitaphs 
which will follow from this practice, we are given 
the following examples : " isyu (ishu, ishyu)," 
and " tordz (toewerdz, toerdz)." We should 
doubtless also get " ishoe," " toardz," and many 
others, wondering all the time what the writer 
was trying to say. The example of the ingen- 
ious person who showed that " scimitar " might 
be spelled in we forget how many ways stands 
as a solemn warning against indulgence in this 
happy-go-lucky practice, which is gravely recom- 
mended to us as a saver of time for school chil- 
dren and an economizer of energy for the adult 
brain. 

In an unguarded moment, the Bulletin ad- 
mits that the Cause " invites humor, and indeed 
makes it inevitable." Its sponsors, we are told, 
" have more fun with spelling, simplified and 
unsimplified, than any other class of human 



beings." An exhibit of this playful spirit is 
made in several instances. Does the man who 
issued the Edict of Oyster Bay six years ago 
need to be defended from criticism as a back- 
slider because his "African Game Trails" is 
written in dictionary words, the defence is 
found in obedience to the scriptural injunction, 
"Authors, obey your publishers in the Lord, 
lest they turn again and rend you." This is 
fairly side-splitting. The word "manoeuvres" 
provides an opportunity for much merry jest- 
ing. "If ten thousand American soldiers were 
opposed by twenty French soldiers, and if the 
victory of the American soldiers depended 
on their pronouncing manoeuvres just as the 
twenty Frenchmen would, the whole ten thou- 
sand would be left gloriously ded on the field of 
battle, while the twenty heroic Frenchmen would 
roll their tungs in triumf." It seems that even 
Webster does not take enough liberties with this 
word, because he feebly compromises on "man- 
euver," whereas the free-born American calls it 
" manoover." If this be so, it is a grievous fault, 
paralleled only by the awful example of the New 
York " Evening Post " when it lapsed from grace 
in the spelling of " pronunciamiento " shortly 
after Mr. Godkin's death. To the charge that the 
spelling reformers are only " an unauthorized 
group of persons," we have a crushing rejoinder 
in the shape of a quotation from an English 
scholar anent Julius Caesar: "The oldest part 
of the Tower is said to have been built by Julius 
Caesar without any authority." Also the Pilgrim 
Fathers and the Signers and the Abolitionists 
were "unauthorized" groups of reformers. 
More than usually ponderous is the sarcasm 
expended upon a university teacher of English 
who, when asked if he had read the literature 
of the Simplified Spelling Board, replied irrele- 
vantly : " No, I would rather read ' Cymbeline.' " 
This leads to an array of quotations from the 
play, all in the lawless orthography of 1600, 
such as the following: 

" When shall I hear all through ? This fierce 
abridgment " [thru], 

or as this : 

" Our very eyes, 
Are sometimes like our Judgements, blinde." 

Another quotation from " Cymbeline " seems to 
us more apt, as a suggestive commentary upon 
the Cause as a whole, than any of those given. 
It is brief and to the point : " The game is up." 
But it is perhaps too much to suppose that the 
game will be really "up" as long as the subsidy 
holds out.

ANOTHER LITERARY MARE'S-NEST. 

Alas for the ingenuity of man ! Simple truth, 
plain fact, recorded history do not please him. He 
must go behind the returns. He must suspect, sur- 
mise, invent, and out of the accepted data of the past 
weave himself a crazy-quilt pattern of his own. He 
is not going to be deceived by the disinterested liars 
of old times. He knows their business a great deal 
better than they did themselves. He can see through 
the millstones or milestones of the past, and they are 
not what they are supposed to be. 

The standard, the paragon, of critical delusions 
woven by over-smartness, the most prodigious 
fabric ever built without foundation, is the theory 
of the Baconian authorship of Shakespeare. Against 
probability, against evidence, against certainty, it 
persists. James Spedding, who gave thirty years 
to the study of Bacon's life and works, for the sole 
purpose of rehabilitating and aggrandizing his hero, 
said of this theory : " I see no reason to suppose that 
Shakespeare did not write the plays. But if some- 
body else did, then I think I am in a position to say 
that it was not Lord Bacon." I have often thought 
that the French have wasted a good chance for a 
similar controversy in regard to Moliere. Why do 
they not pool their issues, as it were, form an 
intellectual Trust and put forth the claim to an all- 
accomplished genius in the person of Pascal ? Pascal 
was the most learned and the most variously gifted 
man of his time in Europe. He was a metaphysician, 
mathematician, inventor, master of polite letters, 
and pupil of polite society. His father was a Judge, 
and he was brought up in ease and in the company 
of the best minds of his period. What is more likely 
than that he wrote the Molieresque comedies ? That 
he had the power to do so is evident ; for, while there 
is nothing to show that Lord Bacon could have writ- 
ten a single page of Shakespeare, the author of the 
"Provincial Letters" and the "Pense'es" had the 
wit, the perception of character, the creative gift, 
the profound philosophy necessary to have written 
the plays ascribed to Moliere. And the latter, 
how does it stand with him ? How is it possible that 
the son of a vulgar upholsterer, a strolling actor 
battered and beaten about the provinces for fifteen 
years, how is it possible that he could have ac- 
quired the learning, the knowledge of society, the 
nobility of thought, and the depth of philosophy 
which the comedies display? It is true that Pascal 
died at a time when only two of Moliere's Parisian 
successes had been produced; but it is easy to get 
around that difficulty. We have only to suppose 
that Pascal wrote the rest of the plays before and 
after his retirement to Port-Royal, and handed 
them over in bulk to Moliere to be brought out as 
occasion required, and our theory is right and tight 
enough. That the French have not allowed such a 
theory to form and get headway, while the English 
have looked on stupified at the Baconian folly, 
would seem to prove that the former, beneath their 
surface extravagances, are entirely sane, while the 



latter under their veneer of common sense are es- 
sentially eccentric. And one form of English, and 
still more American, eccentricity is the excessive 
reverence paid to learning, and the disposition to rely 
upon the acquirer of information for all other good 
things. If we could only realize that, as far as lit- 
erature at least is concerned, mere learning is the 
iron pyrites, the fool's gold, and natural parts are the 
true metal, then there would be an end of such delu- 
sions as the Baconian theory. 

But let us leave the tormentors of Shakespeare 
to their fate, and turn to another "question" which 
seems to be looming up. Emily Bronte is the 
Sphinx of literature. A spirit so removedly re- 
served, so profoundly proud, yet so touched with 
tenderness, her like can scarcely be found among 
the daughters of men. She was brave to temerity ; 
she stood up to meet her death. And her work is 
not merely Amazon work it is man's work. Every 
epithet which Matthew Arnold instinctively applied 
to her when he said that her soul 

" Knew no fellow for might, 
Passion, vehemence, grief, 
Daring, since Byron died," 

testifies to this male quality in her. 

Accordingly, some years ago a Mr. Leyland put 
forth a book advocating the claim of Branwell 
Bronte to the authorship of "Wuthering Heights." 
Undoubtedly there is a good deal of Branwell in 
the book. His experiences, his letters, and recorded 
ravings all show that he was, or thought he was, a 
close kinsman to Heathcliff e, for whom he must have 
served as a partial model. But there is absolutely 
nothing to prove that he had any real literary power. 
And his boastfulness was such that if he had had 
any direct hand in the book, he would have made 
the welkin ring with his claims. So Mr. Leyland's 
revelations obtained no credence. 

A book rather portentously entitled "The Key to 
the Bronte Works," by Mr. John Malham-Dembleby, 
has recently appeared. In it, with a great show of 
parallel citations and of labelled "Critical Methods," 
Mr. Malham-Dembleby seeks to show that Charlotte 
Bronte was the real author of " Wuthering Heights." 
We hardly think that Mr. Malham-Dembleby 's 
"critical methods" would require notice, were it 
not that his book displays some real discoveries as 
the results of his investigation. One of the most 
interesting of these discoveries is the unearthing of 
a romance by Eugene Sue, published in 1850-51, 
apparently founded on the occurrences in the He"ger 
household in Brussels, and showing that the relations 
of M. He*ger, Madame He*ger, and Charlotte Bronte 
must have been public property on the continent 
at that date. This work of gossip, however, has no 
bearing on the authorship of "Wuthering Heights." 
The other discovery may have some such bearing. 
This is in the shape of a tourist's guide-book to York- 
shire written by Frederick Montagu, in which Mr. 
Malham-Dembleby professes to find the germs of 
some of the scenes and characters of both " Wuther- 
ing Heights" and "Jane Eyre." Granting the 



278 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



similarities, it is possible to reason quite differently 
than he does about them. Books were scarce in 
that Haworth parsonage, and it would seem prob- 
able that the home-loving Emily, who pined in 
spirit when away from the moors, should have been 
the one to pore over this Yorkshire guide, rather 
than the errant and city-loving Charlotte. And as 
"Wuthering Heights" was unquestionably written 
before "Jane Eyre," Charlotte may have merely 
followed her sister's lead and taken Montagu's data 
at second hand. 

Apart from external evidence, of which there is 
plenty, there are four great reasons which must neg- 
ative Charlotte Bronte's authorship of " Wuthering 
Heights." The first of these is the character of 
Emily Bronte, which we have glanced at above. 
Was she the being to descend to the level of a com- 
mon cheat, to deck herself in borrowed plumes, to 
go forth to the world as an impostor ? The thing is 
incredible. And if she had done so, would Charlotte, 
herself a scorner of meanness and deception, have 
kept on loving and revering her during her life ? 
Would she, after Emily's death, have reared for her 
a monument in the noble and spirited figure of 
Shirley Keeldar ? Human nature is not built in that 
way. Charlotte Bronte was not wanting in self- 
assurance. She could hold her opinion of herself 
against others. She retorted sharply on Lewes when 
he implied that she had a great deal to learn from 
Jane Austen. But every line that she wrote about 
Emily testifies not merely to a sisterly affection but 
to an admiration of almost startled wonder. She 
never wrote about Anne Bronte in any such terms. 

The poems constitute a second obstacle to Char- 
lotte's assumption of the novel. Mr. Malham- 
Dembleby does not pretend to claim Emily's for 
her sister, which, in view of the tame, ladylike, 
colorless character of Charlotte's verse, is prudent. 
Nearly all of Emily's pieces are at least touched with 
the divine fire, and four or five of them stand by 
themselves in literature. They are and will be a 
part of all anthologies, and are so great that were 
Emily really robbed of " Wuthering Heights " it 
would not seriously lower her intellectual place. Of 
course it is a matter for critical opinion, how far the 
authorship of the poems makes valid the authorship 
of the novel. To me they seem to bear the same 
stamp. They are bone and flesh and blood of one 
being. At the very least, they indicate that Emily 
could have written the novel. Now there is a cloud 
of witnesses to prove that all three of the girls were 
busy writing stories from their childhood up. And 
M. Heger thought that Emily's prose themes were 
superior to Charlotte's. Anne Bronte, though she 
had considerably less leisure than Emily, left two 
fair-sized novels. If " Wuthering Heights " is taken 
from Emily, what did she write ? 

The characters of Heathcliffe and Rochester are 
enough in themselves to proclaim the separate 
authorship of the two novels. If Charlotte Bronte, 
with her prentice hand, carved the black statue of 
Heathcliffe, faultless in design, unflawed in execu- 



tion, and then in full practice put together the sham- 
bling, uncertain workmanship of Rochester, she made 
a more sudden fall than any other known artist. 
Heathcliffe is all of a piece, tragic, intense, true 
to the conception from first word to the last. He 
might have stepped out of a great Elizabethan play. 
Rochester is mostly melodramatic, and at times he 
is almost comic. He is a woman's conception of a 
strong man. In fact, the petticoat is not far away 
from any of Charlotte's male characters. It peeps 
out in Mr. Helstone and the Moores, and Paul 
Emanuel is entirely wrapped up in it. Charlotte was 
as intensely womanly as her sister was male. All 
her novels are saved by the depth and splendor of 
her female characters. On the contrary, the women 
in " Wuthering Heights " are hardly more than 
despicable. 

Lastly, Emily and Charlotte set the seal of their 
respective natures on the prose style of their books. 
Emily's prose is bare, naked of ornament, interpos- 
ing no veil of words between her meaning and the 
reader's mind. Even her descriptive passages are 
of the shortest, a sentence or two, a hint or sug- 
gestion rather than a deliberate piece of painting. 
Charlotte, on the contrary, is rich and full and vari- 
ous. Her books are strewn over with purple patches. 
In their rich efflorescence they are like the Brazilian 
woods where, it is said, if you twitch a liana on the 
borders of Bolivia, the President at Rio will feel the 
movement. She loves words and images for their 
own sake, and she deals with them superbly. Now 
it is not impossible that one and the same author 
should command these two styles; but where this 
has been so, it has been at the extremes of a long 
life. And the instinct for wreaking the thought on 
expression has always corne first. If Charlotte 
wrote " Wuthering Heights " she must have been 
dowered with austerity and restraint in the begin- 
ning, and then very quickly forgot these qualities. 

In spite of " The Key to the Bronte Works " we 
fancy that the picture, which has so impressed the 
imagination of the world, of the three girls of genius, 
" mewing their mighty youth " in the lonely York- 
shire parsonage, from whence two of them, at least, 
were to rise in eagle wheelings visible to all the 
world, will long remain unaltered and unobscured.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



A YEAR'S LITERARY COMPANIONSHIP, the devo- 
tion of at least a part of one's daily reading time 
for twelve months to one great book, or to one great 
author, will not be without permanent results to 
the reader. A man is known by the company he 
keeps. The president of Columbia University the 
other day gave this advice to an audience of under- 
graduates: "Resolve to pass the year in company 
with some high and noble character." Then fol- 
lowed suggestions as to the different works of lit- 
erature likely to suit different temperaments and

moods, ranging over some of the classics of a more 
or less distant past. But not every one can prevail 
on himself to cut loose from the fascinations of cur- 
rent thought and its manifold expression in literary 
form. The volumes of Gibbon's ' k Rome " are pushed 
impatiently aside in favor of Professor McMaster's 
or Dr. Rhodes's latest continuation of our own 
history; Masson's "Milton," Carlyle's "Frederick," 
and even Boswell's "Johnson" prove less imme- 
diately inviting than the lives and letters and rem- 
iniscences of those modern celebrities whom one 
has either actually seen and known or at least felt 
keenly interested in. The reader, unwilling to 
follow President Butler's advice exactly as given, 
may yet find in current literature, in the books of 
this present season, not a few "high and noble 
characters" in whose company to pass the year. 
The two substantial posthumous volumes of John 
Bigelow's "Retrospections" will furnish inspiring 
reading matter for one's spare moments through 
the coming winter and beyond. Mark Twain, too, is 
one with whom a year's leisure hours can profitably 
be passed in the three rich volumes of Mr. Paine's 
admirable biography. George Meredith's letters, 
also, offer opportunity for many half-hours of com- 
munion with a master-mind. And, without going 
outside this deservedly popular class of books, one 
can en joy ably and profitably linger for months over 
such works as Mr. George Haven Putnam's biog- 
raphy of his father, and Mr. James K. Hosmer's 
"Last Leaf" a few pages at a time. The em- 
barrassment is one of riches, in respect to books for 
companionship, and of poverty, with most of us, in 
respect to available half-hours or quarter-hours to 
give to that companionship. 



THE LIBRARIAN'S HUMAN SIDE is the side that 
probably stands most in need of development. The 
professional, bibliographic, bibliothecal side will 
commonly take care of itself, and do it so well that 
the librarian, unless he be on his guard, will soon 
become conspicuously " lop-sided." Some sensible 
remarks on this head are reported in the current 
"Library Notes and News " of the Minnesota Public 
Library Commission, from Miss Flora B. Roberts, 
presiding genius of the Superior (Wis.) Public 
Library. Always timely, and seldom sufficiently 
heeded, are such reminders and counsels as these to 
library workers: ''Our work is not automatic; a 
book read enters into the life of the reader, whether 
it be the heart life, the intellectual life, or the play 
life. The book itself has come from the author, pul- 
sating with his life. We are the go-betweens, and 
in order to give the right book to the right person, 
we must be human, with keenness of mind, and much 
sympathy and charity of spirit. Were we to reduce 
our circulation of books to the automatic stamping 
of certain dates in certain places, and certain schemes 
of filing the cards, we might better invent a slot ma- 
chine for the work ; it would be cheaper. But we 
are dealing in human stuff, and we cannot truly 
know our public without becoming a part of that 



public. Therefore I say, join clubs, accept social 
invitations, pay calls, join a church if your religious 
convictions are in sympathy with church organiza- 
tions, serve on committees, make addresses when 
asked get asked sometimes. If you see a need of 
some certain work in the town, take the initiative 
yourself, even if it has nothing to do with the 
library." Clearly, this librarian is convinced that 
though nickel-in-the-slot restaurants and weighing- 
machines and music-boxes may serve a useful office, 
the nickel-in-the-slot library has no place in this 
world of living and breathing and loving and hating 

human beings. 



VAGABONDAGE AND THE LITERARY TEMPERA- 
MENT find themselves not seldom united in the same 
person, perhaps on somewhat the same principle 
that causes extremes to meet. Casanova and George 
Borrow and Sir Richard Burton and Josiah Flynt, 
born tramps, all of them, each in his own kind, were 
as skilled in the narration of their wandering adven- 
tures as they were happy in the knack of encounter- 
ing them. But when a man of books and studies, 
like the late Professor Walter Wyckoff, takes to 
tramping (in an episodical way) for the sake of the 
material it may offer for literary or social-study pur- 
poses, rather than from an inborn love of the open 
road, the telling of the story afterward is likely to 
lack some of the zest that animates the pages of the 
tramp-author, as distinguished from the author- 
tramp. This difference in style between the two is 
well pointed out by an anonymous tramp printer 
who narrates his adventures in "The Saturday 
Evening Post." He says: "That winter I read 
some articles in a magazine written by a college 
professor who had gone tramping to find out how 
it really felt to be a laboring man. His narra- 
tive struck me as odd, for he never knew where to 
turn his hand for a bite to eat when he was hungry ; 
and he made a sort of world-problem of the simple 
question of where to lie down and sleep, with empty 
freight cars and warm roundhouses and convenient 
toolboxes all round him! In the light of my own 
practical experience it seemed to me as though he 
was an academic child who should not have been 
permitted to go out into the world alone. One other 
writer I read with a different interest. He was a 
man who called himself Josiah Flynt; and in his 
description of hobo life I found no room for criti- 
cism, for he knew far more about it than I did. He 
was the real article a tramp who turned writer 
rather than a writer who experimented in being a 
tramp.'' 

THE MUSE IN BONDS, whether in the person of a 
Cervantes in durance vile, or a John Bunyan impris- 
oned for unlicenced preaching, or an Oscar Wilde 
pining away in Reading Gaol, must always excite 
sympathy. The poem (a spontaneous outpouring 
innocent of rhyme and metre) that has lately found 
its way into print from the pen of Mr. Arthur 
Giovannitti, thrown into jail as accessory to murder

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



in connection with the Lawrence (Mass.) mill strike, 
shows the accused to be a man of fine feeling and 
strengthens the presumption of his innocence of the 
crime charged against him, and inclines the reader 
to range himself on the side of Professors Taussig 
and Loeb and the other persons of prominence and 
influence who have protested against the treatment 
to which he and his companion have been subjected, 
Of course the poetic gift is no sufficient warrant of 
blameless moral character, and the following few 
lines from "The Walker" are here quoted merely 
for their poignant, pathetic quality, their haunting 
appeal, their touching picture of one shut out from 
the "sunlit highways of life." 
" I hear footsteps over my head all night. 
They come and they go. Again they come and again they 

go all night. 

They come one eternity in four paces and they go one 
eternity in four paces, and between the coming and the 
going there are Silence and the Night and the Infinite. 
For infinite are the nine feet of a prison cell, and endless 
is the march of him who walks between the yellow 
brick wall and the red iron gate, thinking things that 
cannot be chained and cannot be locked, but wander 
far away in the sunlit world, each in its wild pilgrimage 
after its destined goal. 

" I have heard the stifled sobs of the one who prays with 
his head under the coarse blanket and the whisperings 
of the one who prays with his forehead on the hard, 
cold stone of the floor. 

" And I have heard, most terrible of all, the silence of two 
hundred brains all possessed by one single, relentless, 
unforgiving, desperate thought. 

" I implore you, my brother, for I am weary of the long vigil, 

weary of counting your steps, and heavy with sleep, 
Stop, rest, sleep, my brother, for the dawn is well nigh 
and it is not the key alone that can throw open the door." 



THE TECHNIQUE OF FUTURIST LITERATURE, as 

Signer Marinetti informs the waiting world through 
a recent manifesto, will be distinguished by its sim- 
plicity, its elemental strength, its primitive natural- 
ness. Verbal expression will be reduced to its lowest 
terms. "It is undeniable," explains this ardent 
iconoclast, "that in abolishing the adjective and the 
adverb the noun will regain its essential, complete, 
and characteristic value." The devices of rhetoric 
are an abomination to him. "For that reason," as 
the London "Chronicle" quotes him, "I have re- 
course to the abstract severity of mathematical signs, 
which are useful in expressing quantity and quality 
of emotion by condensing all unnecessary explana- 
tions and avoiding the dangerous folly of losing 
time in phraseological corners and in the finicking 
works of the tailor, the jeweler, and the bootblack. 
Words delivered from the fetters of punctuation 
will flash against one another, will interlace their 
various forms of magnetism, and follow the uninter- 
rupted dynamics of force. A white space of vary- 
ing length will indicate to the reader the moments, 
also of varying length, when intuition rests or sleeps." 
Here let us give, from the Futurist's pen, an example 
of these interlacing forms of magnetism, all unfet- 



tered, of course, by punctuation. The passage de- 
scribes an assault on a Turkish fort. " Towers guns 
virility flights erection telemetre exstasy toumbtoumb

poaff glouglouglouglou hide-and-seek crystals vir-

alleys cries labyrinth mattress sobs ploughing desert 
bed precision telemetre monoplane cackling theatre 
applause monoplane equals balcony rose wheel drum 
trepan gad-fly rout Arabs oxen blood-colour shambles 
wounds refuge oasis." Who, after this, will ever 
care to read those effete and finicking compositions, 
"The Charge of the Light Brigade," or "The Siege 
of Corinth," or the account, in "Childe Harold," of 
the battle of Waterloo, or any similar effusions of 
the anaemic poets of the past? 

HE WHO RIDES MAY READ that is, if he rides in 
a street-car. The importance of this obvious truth 
so impressed itself upon a speaker at the late meet- 
ing of the Wisconsin Library Association that he 
urged the placing of library advertising cards in 
some of those oblong spaces now so eagerly bought 
up by business men who are convinced of the expe- 
diency of keeping their names and descriptions or 
pictures of their wares before the eyes of the trolley- 
travelling public. At Menominee, Michigan, the sug- 
gestion took speedy root and blossomed in the shape 
of sundry inviting placards inserted temporarily and 
by glad permission in the spaces paid for by certain 
commercial houses for their own behoof and profit. 
And the profit in this instance was expected to come 
from the mention of their courtesy on the library 
placards, in the assurance that their complaisance in 
furthering a worthy cause would work them no harm 
in the public estimation. The whole of this inter- 
esting experiment is well told by Miss Lois Amelia 
Spencer of the Menominee Public Library in the 
" Wisconsin Library Bulletin " of July August. It 
is too early to give results of the experiment; but, 
as Miss Spencer says in conclusion, "People un- 
doubtedly read the advertisements in the street-cars. 
If they need to be reminded of the public library, 
isn't it the ideal time and place to do it when they 
are more or less unoccupied and possibly on their 
way to its part of the town? Because it seems so 
logical we are expecting discernible results." 



PIERRE LOTI'S ORIENTALISM, his passion for and 
sympathy with the Far East, colors and even, one 
might say, with a change of metaphor, saturates 
much that he has written. In the course of his 
recent New York visit M. Viaud (Captain Louis 
Marie Julian Viaud will be recalled as the name 
and title in real life of this popular author) took 
occasion to say : " My enthusiasm for the Orient is 
inherent within me. It is a part of my very nature. 



1912.J 



THE DIAJL 



281 



It is not enough that I can see what Oriental life is, 
each and every factor of it strikes an answering 
chord within my soul. I am all that the Oriental 
is, and I am it by nature, just as he is. I am a 
mystic, a dreamer. I love to sit and contemplate, 
as does the Oriental. I have the Oriental sense of 
the beautiful in nature, for the Oriental spends hours 
in peaceful communion with the landscape about 
him, that speaks to him in a language he under- 
stands." Of interest was the visiting Frenchman's 
assertion that " the literature of Japan has had 
practically no effect on the literature of the Occi- 
dent, because we can not fully grasp its significance." 
In perfect accord with what might be called the 
upside-downness of things in the antipodes is the 
common people's preference for poetry to prose. 
They " love poetry," says this authority, " and so 
the native literature expresses itself in verse " as 
it always has where primitive simplicity has not yet 
yielded to sophistication. 



AN IMPORTANT GREEK MANUSCRIPT, an illumi- 
nated transcript, on vellum, of the four Gospels, has 
been presented to the library of the General Theo- 
logical Seminary, whose librarian thus describes the 
gift in his latest yearly Report: "In the summer of 
1911 a Greek manuscript of the four Gospels was 
offered us for purchase. Its price was entirely 
prohibitive as far as our own funds were concerned. 
Through the generosity of Mr. S. V. Hoffman, 
however, whose father, Dean Hoffman, gave us our 
Gutenberg Bible, it was acquired and presented to 
us in perpetuity, to be a treasured possession of the 
Library and an adornment of our Seminary. The 
manuscript itself, hitherto unlisted and unrecorded, 
was examined during April of this year by Professor 
Caspar Rene* Gregory, of the University of Leipzig, 
while here at the Seminary, by him listed and as- 
signed a number in his list of all the Greek New 
Testament manuscripts known to exist. It has been 
ascribed without doubt to the tenth century and is 
probably of Georgian origin. Written on vellum 
of small size and in a minute but careful hand, the 
manuscript is in excellent condition, contains six 
interesting and still brilliant illuminations, and is 
bound in velvet and metal. . . . By this addition 
we have one of the few New Testament manuscripts 
in America of value and importance a manuscript 
which must be a source of pride not only to ourselves, 
but to American Biblical scholars generally." 

THE LIBRARIAN'S NATURAL ALLY in the cam- 
paign of culture against illiteracy in its more or less 
pronounced forms, is of course the schoolteacher. 
Perhaps the teacher would state the proposition the 
other way about, but the effect is much the same. 
The schoolhouse, too, js the natural and logical 
branch of the library. At Pomfret, Vermont (our 
oft-cited model in these matters of rural public- 
library management) each schoolhouse serves as a 
branch library, and as such is designated by the num- 



ber borne by the school district. At Bristol, Con- 
necticut, also, as may be noted in the current annual 
Report of its public library, even the one-room 
schools have been pressed into service by the ener- 
getic librarian, Mr. Charles L. Wooding. He writes 
in his record of yearly progress : " Last winter 
' traveling libraries ' of about 50 volumes each were 
placed in each of the one-room schools of the city, 
under the charge of the teachers, for the benefit of 
the adults living near the schools and remote from 
the central library. The books were exchanged at 
Easter for new collections. As a result 932 volumes 
were issued, and thirty-nine people who had not pre- 
viously used the Library were enrolled as borrowers. 
I wish to record my appreciation of the willing co- 
operation of the teachers, who gladly assumed the 
extra care of the books and their circulation." 

THE FLIPPANT NOTE IN AMERICAN LITERATURE 

has much to answer for if what Miss Hanna Astrup 
Larsen writes in the October " Forum " is true. At 
the end of a rather rousing dissertation on " The 
Cowardice of American Literature " she writes : 
" Puritanism is not so fatal to art as is the Ameri- 
can flippancy, which we flatter ourselves by calling 
the national sense of humor. It is a corrosive, 
beneath which neither poetry nor oratory, neither 
enthusiasm nor earnestness can live. We deny the 
spiritual forces even while we are moved by them, 
and acknowledge only the seen and the tangible. 
But the time is coming when the greater writers of 
the country will give us literature, and not levity; 
when life will no longer be caricatured, or truth 
distorted." A heavy charge, this ; but it may be 
that Miss Larsen, with an excess of seriousness trace- 
able to her Norwegian extraction, over-emphasizes 
the banefulness of the American jocosity. Every 
literature, every literary masterpiece, has the defects 
of its qualities ; and if we sacrificed our love of fun 
because of the occasional pranks it plays on us, might 
we not fall victims to far worse proclivities ? No 
antidote to moroseness can be a very harmful dose. 



POETRY IN THE SOUL OF THE CHINESE TRADES- 
MAN finds expression in sign-boards of wonderful 
wording. A Pekin coal merchant, as a recent ob- 
server has noted, euphemistically styles his stock-in- 
trade "heavenly embroidery," and a dealer in oil 
and wine calls his establishment the "Neighborhood 
of Chief Beauty." Other signboards contain such 
inscriptions as "Shop of Heaven-sent Luck," "The 
Nine Felicities Prolonged," " The Shop of Celestial 
Principles," "Mutton Shop of Morning Twilight," 
" The Ten Virtues all Complete," and " Flowers 
Rise to the Milky Way." Now and then the shop- 
man makes his signboard proclaim in choice phrase 
his own virtues, as "The Thrice Righteous" and 
" The Honest Pen Shop of Li," or some personal 
peculiarity, as " The Steel Shop of the Pockmarked 
Wang." The height of the poetic is attained by a 
charcoal shop which calls itself the " Fountain of

Beauty." The Dean of Gloucester remarked, a cen- 
tury and a half ago, that "what is true of a shop- 
keeper is true of a shopkeeping nation." If that is 
correct, then China, as far as it is a country of retail 
buying and selling, should be a country fond of the 
felicities of figurative and picturesque language, 
which, in fact, it is to a noted degree. 



AUSTRALIA'S LITERARY LIKINGS manifest them- 
selves in favor of American books, especially novels 
and works having to do with actual experience and 
adventure, sport, travel, and the like. The editor 
of the London " Book Monthly" calls attention to 
this popularity of the American book in Australia, 
a popularity not yet enjoyed by its English rival ; 
for that far-distant continent (if the geographies 
now call it such) is a new land, newer even than 
America, and its affinities are for the literature of 
new rather than of old and conventionalized coun- 
tries. One recalls the enthusiastic welcome given 
to Mark Twain in his world-encircling lecture tour. 
The stories of a Mark Twain or a Bret Harte 
naturally suit the popular taste in Australia as those 
of no English novelist can. The increasing market 
for American books there is noted by the above- 
named writer, who advises English publishers to 
bestir themselves in that quarter. 



A TACTFUL HINT from a courteous foreign visitor 
takes the following form: "Have you not perhaps 
paid and are you not perhaps paying too dearly for 
your material progress ? It is ill to lose the faculty 
of contemplation and the conditions of life that 
encourage it." The timely warning is from him 
whom all the world knows by his pseudonym, 
" Pierre Loti." It is not very many years ago 
that another distinguished Frenchman was with us, 
preaching the gospel of the simple life and calling us 
back to the things of the spirit. But what heed was 
paid to the friendly advice of M. Charles Wagner, 
and what heed will be paid to that of this later 
admonitor? Perhaps after the present strenuous 
few weeks are past we shall have time to sober 
down and reflect, and to read "The Home of the 
Soul" and "The Simple Life." 



THE PERENNIAL APPEAL OF TRANSCENDENTAL- 
ISM an appeal which, it is true, evokes response 
quite as often in the unscholarly and the credulous 
as in the educated and the thoughtful seems just 
now to be making itself heard with remarkable suc- 
cess in St. Louis, if credit is to be given to the report 
from that city to the effect that the public library 
records there show Emerson's essays to be among 
the most sought-f or literature of the non-fiction class. 
This rumor is highly creditable to St. Louis, and 
helps to disprove the late Andrew Lang's too hasty 
assertion that Emerson is now an inoperative factor 
in the literary world. Meanwhile, in visible refu- 
tation of this charge, the publication of the Emerson 
"Journals" goes steadily forward, volumes seven 
and eight being announced for November. 



COMMUNICATIONS. 



MORE ABOUT THE STORY OF OLD FORT 

DEARBORN. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Referring to Mr. Quaife's letter in the last issue of 
THE DIAL, I note that he " does not desire to engage 
in a personal dispute" with me; to which I may reply 
that I do not particularly enjoy a controversy of this 
kind myself. But as Mr. Quaife is concerned about the 
" truth of history," it will be worth while to notice one 
or two things he has to say. 

For example, he says that no man by the name of 
Cooper was killed at the Fort Dearborn Massacre. 
How is it possible to account for the fact that a man of 
that name is mentioned in the letters of A. H. Edwards, 
printed in Fergus's Historical Pamphlet (No. 16, pp. 
54, 56)? Mr. Quaife's waiving of Cooper out of exist- 
ence suggests the countryman who remarked to his wife, 
while they were gazing upon a strange specimen at the 
Zoo, " Come along Maria, there ain't no such animal." 

Mr. Quaife returns to the subject of Gen. Dearborn's 
"distinguished services on the Niagara frontier" (this 
sentence being quoted from my book), and remarks that 
any schoolboy knows that these services were not " dis- 
tinguished " in the sense in which I used the word. In 
Winsor's " Narrative and Critical History of America " 
(Vol 3, p. 389), it is stated that the expedition directed 
by Dearborn on the Canadian town of York " was suc- 
cessful, the enemy was driven off with the loss of over 
half their numbers, the town was taken," etc. This 
movement, it is said, "met with greater success than any 
which had hitherto been undertaken on the frontier." 

Regarding access to the Swearingen narrative, the 
manuscript of which is preserved in the collections of 
the Chicago Historical Society, Mr. Quaife says that " it 
is not true that the public had no access to knowledge 
concerning the date of beginning the construction of 
the first Fort Dearborn prior to the reviewer's ' Record- 
Herald ' article of last month." His own words in the 
article referred to were that the manuscript had been 
"brought to light recently." Thus his contradiction 
applies to his own statement much more than to mine, 
which was merely based on what he himself had said. 

I would not be so foolish as to claim that there are 
no errors in my book; and under ordinary circumstances 
I should feel grateful for such corrections and criticisms 
as might be suggested. A knowledge of the minute 
details connected with our early history is creditable 
to anyone who searches for it, but united with a bitter 
censoriousness of the work of others it is of but dimin- 
ished and minor value. 

It seems strange that out of the dozen or so reviews 
of my book which I have seen, some of them written 
by reviewers of great reputation, and all of which were 
favorable, it remained for a fellow worker in the field 
of local history to find my book utterly without merit, 
with not a single word of commendation for any feature 
of the work. 

There may be different views as to the reliability of 
my authorities, but such as they are they can be referred 
to precisely. My views as to their value may be fairly 
challenged, but I deny the charge that my methods 
are " unsound " or that my work is " superficial." The 
many years I have devoted to a careful collection of 
the sources of out- local history, and the visible results 
thereof, are a sufficient testimony to the thoroughness

of my methods. This will be corroborated, I am sure, 
by a " cloud of witnesses " in every historical society and 
in every library and university of the state who know 
me and know of my work in this field. The important 
collections of the Evanston Historical Society, which I 
have gathered, without thought of pecuniary reward, 
and primarily for the purpose of assisting students in 
historical research, may be pointed out in evidence. I 
have, indeed, received compensation for some of my 
writings, but that was long after I had devoted myself 
to a task pursued under immense difficulties and at 
great personal sacrifices. 

It would seem but natural that those engaged in the 
same fields of investigation should cultivate a friendly 
feeling towards one another. They might differ as to 
methods and values, but they should at least be fair. 
My effort was submitted with diffidence, and only after 
much urging was it undertaken. I have never presumed 
to class myself with professional historians, and have 
constantly suggested to publishers that they should 
employ such men as professors of history in our great 
institutions rather than myself. But having undertaken 
the task, I may be allowed to say that my writings on 
the subject of Chicago history and North Shore history 
are a readable and reasonably accurate presentation, as 
has been testified to by a great number of readers and 
fair-minded reviewers. j. SEYMOUR CURBEY.

EARLY PREJUDICES AGAINST GREAT 

LITERATURE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The editorial in your October 1 issue, on " Classical 
Rubbish," has impressed upon me a little personal inci- 
dent that may interest your readers in the recounting. 

I have a very dear friend, an old lady of about seventy 
years of age, my mother. Her father was a great 
lover of books, and I have been told that the library on 
his old Southern plantation was stocked with some of 
the richest stores that could be found. It was burned 
during the war between the States, and, like the remain- 
der of the wealth of the plantation, has faded away in 
that great strife. 

It would be impossible to understand exactly how my 
mother gained her attitude toward literature, without 
knowing the conditions that surrounded her childhood. 
In the matter of reading she seems to have been per- 
mitted to do very much as she chose. Her education 
was left to the care of a Northern woman a spy who 
conducted a school in the heart of the South during the 
war. It was the general belief of the community that 
it was unwise to give females too much education, as 
husbands did not like intellectual equals. In this atmos- 
phere she developed a love for the sort of literature of 
which we hear so much from the average boarding- 
school girl. She read those books which girls sigh over 
in nooks and corners. Possibly it would be unfair to 
give any of the titles, but they were bound in paper 
covers and might be bought for ten or twenty-five cents 
apiece. 

" Why do n't you read this, and this ? " I have often 
asked her, mentioning certain books by the best writers. 
"I'm too old to change my ways," she would always 
reply. "You read them, and let me read what I like." 

I hope I was never snobbish about my views on the 
subject, yet it worried me a great deal. One day I 
dropped into her room with a well-known volume of 
Victor Hugo. I begged her to read it. She took the 



book from me with a smile and, in her patronizing way, 
said she would. 

The next day, upon inquiring how she was enjoying 
the book, I was greeted with the response that she had 
read nearly half of it and had found it stupid. Upon 
closer inquiry I found she had but an indistinct idea of 
the plot. Thereupon I sat down and read aloud to her 
the opening chapters. Thus encouraged she began again, 
with the volume, and read slowly and carefully. Day 
by day she would sit at her window in the warm sun of 
the autumn, at times with tears streaming down her face 
with sorrow for Jean, and then with eyes twinkling with 
smiles for the little waif. She would recount to me 
each evening what she had read. Naturally the roman- 
tic sections of the book at first appealed to her, then she 
became deeply interested in its sociological aspects. I 
believe that what she got out of that book amounted to 
more than she had ever gained from all her previous- 
reading. 

She told me later that she had always been preju- 
diced against books that bore the stamp of literature, 
and for this reason she had refused to read the recog- 
nized classics. Is not that the basic reason why we have 
such a large reading public for the enormous output of 
commonplace novels? Is it not because so many of us 
are prejudiced, because so many of us have never 
taken the trouble to find out how to enjoy good reading?

THE USES OF "CLASSICAL RUBBISH." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Allow one appreciative reader to thank you for 
your editorial of October 1, on " Classical Rubbish." 
Religious scruples perhaps deterred the writer to whom 
you refer from putting the Bible in his list, where I 
suppose it would logically belong if it were judged 
simply by its literary merit. 

I remember coaching a young fellow years ago for 
the university examinations in English, and being 
surprised by his almost total lack of response to the 
Scriptural quotations or allusions in Burke's speech on 
Conciliation with America. The boy was Boston-born, 
clever, studious, knew his Paris and Berlin and 
passed all his examinations; but I greatly fear that he 
will never be either a good American or a cosmopolitan 
of broad human sympathies. 

A man may be a dilettante, a diner-out, a class- 
conscious elegant idler, with very little knowledge of 
the great books; but for a broad, sane spirit of democ- 
racy, a hearty acceptance of one's place and function 
in the great world, a sense of hunior that cries out 
against snobbery, send a boy or a girl to the literature 
that is " not of an age, but for all time." 

The world is no kindergarten for mere pleasure and 
play. If I like to read " Lear " and " Cymbeline," so 
much the better and far better; but I shall certainly 
read them. If I have a healthy appetite for the strong 
meat of the Bible, that is as it should be; but I will

GEORGE MEREDITH HIMSELF.* 



Much more unanimity of opinion is likely to 
obtain in regard to George Meredith's excel- 
lence as a letter- writer than has existed in regard 
to his significance as novelist and poet. For 
the qualities which tended to obscure his art 
are scarcely an obstacle in his correspondence ; 
and certain attractive personal qualities which 
tended to be obscured by his art lend the Let- 
ters a singular fascination. 

Of chief importance to the general reader, 
no doubt, will be the fact that Meredith is a 
fellow of infinite faculty for being interesting 
in detail. It is not improbable, therefore, that 
the Letters will have a fate the reverse of that 
which fell upon the author's early works, the 
fate of considerable popularity, attended, per- 
haps, by considerable over-estimation of the 
book's ultimate value. Consideration of that 
value will be incidental, in the present review, 
to an examination of the autobiographic aspect 
of the Letters ; since, whatever else may be said 
of them, they are bound to have an exceptional 
present significance as a revelation of an unique 
personality. 

This revelation has been in no degree fore- 
stalled : a straight road lies before the Letters 
across the somewhat meandering ways of Mere- 
dithian biography (if the term be at all perti- 
nent) and interpretative criticism. These, to be 
sure, have widely traversed the country of our 
author's personality ; but they have been sing- 
ularly unsuccessful in opening up the central 
region of it. Nor has the reason for that failure 
been properly stated in Mr. Hammerton's 
" George Meredith in Anecdote and Criticism," 
which has hitherto been our chief authority on 
the subject: "His personality is mountainous; 
and who has ever read a description of Mont 
Blanc or Vesuvius that would serve for all the 
seasons or all its phases of one day, one hour 
even?" Rather is it true that the several brilliant 
surfaces of that personality have been peculiarly 
reflective of certain present-day lights, and the 
resultant dazzle has obscured its clear outlines. 
Meredithian "biography" has therefore been 
unusually vivid and external; typical of it is 
Mr. Hammerton's bulky scrap-book, in which 
our author is sufficiently sung, drawn, and 
"newspapered." Criticism, at the same time, 

*THE LETTERS OF GEORGE MEREDITH. Collected and 
edited by his son. 'In two volumes. With portraits. New 
York : Charles Scribner's Sons. 



has been too busy estimating the good, or evil, 
significance of Meredith's various reflections of 
our age to lay bare his entity. So that while 
a fairly definite conception has arisen of the 
central purport of Meredith's younger contem- 
poraries Swinburne, Stevenson, Hardy his 
own remains hazy. From the numerous articles 
about him, even from the different chapters of 
single books, one may derive quite divergent 
notions. These, very roughly speaking, may be 
reduced to two general impressions. According 
to the one, Meredith is something of a Mont 
Blanc if one may thus twist Mr. Hammerton's 
handy imagery; and according to the second, 
something of a Vesuvius. In the one picture, 
our author wears an appearance of almost classic 
calm, at the least, he towers considerably 
above the swift complexity of nineteenth cen- 
tury life; whatever of this quality appears in 
his mode of expression is but a cloud border, 
beyond which a smooth front is opposed to the 
heavens, glowing with ripe intellectual discern- 
ment. In the other picture, the subject is quite 
volcanically restless with his burden of leading 
thought-tendencies of the time ; above, the hea- 
vens are somewhat obscured, and yet what 
an admirable mouthpiece, what a "spiritual" 
mouthpiece, if one's fancy can compass the 
image, our sturdy Vesuvius is of Her on whom 
we should chiefly rest our hopes, Mother Earth 

" that cannot stop, 
Where ever upward is the visible aim." 

These two impressions, if traced to their 
original sources, are seen to derive again very 
roughly speaking from two corresponding 
divisions of Meredith's works, dealing respect- 
ively with man in relation to society and with 
man in relation to nature. The first group 
includes of course the novels, but also a large 
number of the poems ; its ground-tone is sounded 
by the "Ode to the Comic Spirit." The other 
comprises the nature poetry, typical of which 
is the greater part of "A Reading of Earth." 
In the Letters, the two pictures merge. Mont 
Blanc, ceasing to be " mountainous," becomes 
the nucleus of a singularly gifted and effective 
personality; the other appears simply as an 
active mode of this. 

Probably no previous author's letters have 
been more constantly related to his works than 
are Meredith's to his novels. To be sure, as 
his editor admits, " many of his intimate friends, 
and a large number of his letters to them, do 
not for various reasons appear here at all"; and 
one must hope that certain important links will 
be supplied in time. Yet not only is the cor-

respondence in its present form comprehensive, 
covering practically all of the author's produc- 
tive years, but it involves an interesting series 
of persons, places, and events made use of in 
the novels. The fact that the novels were re- 
solutely allusive to contemporary social condi- 
tions has thus worked to the advantage of the 
Letters: the writer has constantly an artistic 
and philosophic interest, as well as a personal 
one, in his correspondents and his topics. In 
the letters to Janet Duff Gordon (later Mrs. 
Ross), to Frederick Maxse, and to William 
Hardman we find much of that range of obser- 
vation which stimulated the creation not merely 
of Rose Jocelyn, Nevil Beauchamp, and Black- 
burn Tuckham but of three general character- 
types prominent in the novels as a whole and 
holding keystone positions in Meredith's social 
theory. At the same time we are shown, in 
the concrete, the temperamental affiliations and 
contrasts between those types of character and 
our author himself. To each of the three friends 
he turns a distinct and important side of his 
nature. To Janet he is always "your poet," 
humorously admitting the larger admixture of 
air and fire in his own constitution. The con- 
trast, which reminds the reader vaguely of that 
between Rose Jocelyn and Evan Harrington, 
crops out in connection with many topics for 
instance, the Royal Academy exhibit: 

"Leighton has a 'Paola and Francesca'; painted 
just as the book has dropped and they are in no state 
to read more. You would scorn it; but our friendship 
never rested on common sentiments in art. I greatly 
admire it. I think it the sole English picture exhibiting 
passion that I have seen." 

The fact that comparatively few letters to 
Mrs. Ross and other of his women friends appear 
in the collection will be regretted by those who 
think of Meredith chiefly as the creator of Rose, 
Diana, and all the others in whom blood and 
judgment are so well commingled or get them- 
selves commingled through hard experience. 
Apropos of Diana, one is interested to find an 
already known circumstance phrased as follows : 

" I am just finishing at a great pace a two- volume 
novel, to be called ' Diana of the Crossways ' partly 
modelled upon Mrs. Norton. But this is between our- 
selves. I have had to endow her with brains and make 
them eviderfce to the discerning. I think she lives." 
This was written on March 24, 1884; and the 
reader who has ground his teeth over the close 
of that novel, will experience some malicious 
joy when he comes across the following sequel, 
written just five months later: 

" My ' Diana ' still holds me; only by the last chap- 
ter; but the coupling of such a woman and her man is 
a delicate business. She has no puppet-pliancy. The 



truth being, that she is a mother of Experience, and 
gives that dreadful baby suck to brains. I have there- 
fore a feeble hold of her; none of the novelist's winding- 
up arts avail; it is she who leads me." 

The numerous letters to Maxse are in several 
ways at once the most appealing and the most 
illuminating in the collection. They are enliv- 
ened by Meredith's brusque, incisive criticisms 
of his friend when the two differ in opinion on 
such various matters as art, the liquor question, 
or the government of Ireland, on one occasion, 
"The hero of Beauchamp 's Career just bears 
with me, so stiffly have his bristles been rubbed 
up by the Irish." Always, however, Meredith's 
deep-seated affection for the other is apparent, 
especially when he is concerned about the pos- 
sible effects of Maxse's impetuosity. Such a 
condition arose when, near the beginning of 
their intercourse, Maxse fell in love, informed 
Meredith, and received in reply just such a 
letter of advice as one can imagine Nevil Beau- 
champ, mad for Renee, receiving from our au- 
thor. That Meredith had Maxse in mind also 
when creating Harry Richmond is intimated in 
the following : 

" I have just finished the History of the inextinguish- 
able Sir Harry Firebrand of the Beacon, Knight Errant 
of the 19th century, in which mirror you may look and 
see; My dear Fred and his loving friend, 

GEORGE MEREDITH." 

But the type of the extremist, who is likely to 
run unwittingly into egoism, embraces both of 
these characters and is of cardinal importance in 
the majority of the novels. With the attempt, 
into which his social insight led him, to isolate 
that egoism in a single character, Meredith was 
dissatisfied, he says of "The Egoist": "It is 
a Comedy with only half of me in it, unlikely 
therefore to take either the public or my friends. 
This is true truth, but I warned you that I am 
cursed with a croak." 

A perfect complement to the Maxse letters is 
provided by those to Hardman, dubbed " Tuck " 
by Meredith in allusion to the friar of earthly 
disposition, and characterized as follows : " A 
dangerous man, Sir, for he tempteth us to love 
this life and esteems it a cherishable thing : yet, 
withal, one whom to know once is to desire ever. 
For indeed such a one is seldom seen." The 
writer's comments on Hardman send our 
thoughts not only to Blackburn Tuckham but 
to Red worth, Matey Weyburn, and other all- 
round, commonsense personages who frequent 
the novels. In outline these characters loom up, 
indeed, behind the glowing haze of the nature 
poems ; for surely they are the favorite " sons " 
framed by Earth to " read " her, and successful

in doing so if they acquire the requisite infusion 
of " spirit " a quality which, when one turns 
a prosaic eye on the poems, appears a somewhat 
vague by-product. This quality is of only occa- 
sional significance in the Letters ; certainly, it 
was not essential to Tuck's attractiveness for 
Meredith. 

" Tuck, Sweet Charmer, tell me why 

I 'm at ease when you are by ? 

Have you had ' a round ' with Care, 

Left him smoshen, stript him bare, 

That he never more can try 

Falls with me when you are by? 

Ah, but when from me you 're screened, 

Attrobiliad glows the fiend: 

Fire is wet and water dry : 

Candles burn cocked hats awry: 

Hope her diamond portal shuts, 

Grim dyspepsia haunts my Ahem! " 

Beneath the surface of these verses, and of many 
scattered passages in the Letters, one catches 
glimpses of inward battles, not merely with 
dyspepsia but with the universe with the 
universe, our author himself would phrase it, 
as seen through the eyes of " that old dragon, 
self." And one is enabled to realize the extent 
to which self-experience was the ground where 
grew that doctrine of self-repression and anti- 
sentimentalism so central in Meredith's works. 
The reader of those works would scarcely sus- 
pect the existence of the tendency referred to in 
the following passage, contained in a letter to 
Maxse and sounding, for his benefit, the char- 
acteristic note of admonishment previously 
mentioned : 

" As regards Hawthorne, little Meredith admits that 
your strokes have truth. I strive by study of human- 
ity to represent it: not its morbid action. I have a 
tendency to do that, which I repress: for, in delineat- 
ing it, there is no gain. In all my, truly, very faulty 
works, there is this aim. Much of my strength lies in 
painting morbid emotion and exceptional positions; but 
my conscience will not let me so waste my time." 

This conscience of Meredith's, potentially be- 
neficent in an age in which sentiment born of 
romance had become the foster-sister of science, 
was what primarily drew him to the like of 
Hardman. Incidentally, the letters to " Tuck " 
overflow with the rich joviality and rollicking 
nonsense which made Box Hill the resort of 
the so-called " Sunday Tramps," captained by 
Leslie Stephen. Concerning his reproduction 
of Stephen in Vernon Whitford another of 
Earth's favorite sons Meredith's own words 
are : " It is a sketch of L. Stephen, but merely 
a sketch, not doing him full justice, though the 
strokes without and within are correct." 

Such, briefly indicated, are the main high- 
ways on which our author gathered the stuff of 



his novels. Also numerous side-paths, many of 
them leading to illuminating discoveries, will 
tempt the reader of the Letters. Another chap- 
ter, the one most stimulative of thoughtful 
laughter, is the series of epigrammatic judg- 
ments passed by the writer on contemporary 
authors. It is safe to say that no other one of 
them had at once such a real sympathy for his 
fellow-craftsmen and such a shrewdly critical 
perception of the net significance of their works. 
Over-boisterous, indeed, becomes the critique of 
the "Idylls of the King"; but then, two poets 
have seldom been temperamentally more antipa- 
thetic than were the Poet Laureate and Meredith. 
It almost exhausts one of the letters to Maxse, 
and evinces, incidentally, the characteristic dif- 
ference of outlook between the two friends. 
Briefer, and often better, are the remarks on 
Carlyle, Mill, Ruskin, Swinburne, Rossetti, 
Morris, Stevenson, Hugo, and several writers 
of lesser note. One may at first wonder at his 
keen championship of Carlyle, considering that, 
in regard to their fundamental attitudes toward 
life, they stand at opposite poles. Carlyle, as 
Meredith puts it in a sonnet on the occasion of 
the seer's eightieth birthday, "bared the roots 
of life with sight piercing"; but, as Meredith 
writes elsewhere, "when he descends to our 
common pavement he is no more sagacious 
nor useful nor temperate than a flash of light- 
ning in a grocer's shop." On the other hand, 
it is exactly on the surface of "our common 
pavement," with its fringe of nature, that 
Meredith himself is most sagacious and tem- 
perate; for him, surely, the pavement was all 
too solid, and the "roots of life" which he cele- 
brates, often intemperately, in his nature poems 
have on the whole been dragged in from the 
fringe and not dug up from below. In short, 
if Carlyle partly aspired to become a critic of 
society and remained a seer, Meredith more 
fully aspired to become a seer and remained a 
critic of society : the course of his development 
in this respect may be followed through numer- 
ous instances in the Letters, especially when 
these are placed side by side with his nature 
poetry. This very aspiration of Meredith's, 
however, was undoubtedly what made him feel 
an affinity with Carlyle. The same extraordi- 
nary range and keenness of intellectual vision 
which enabled him to steer free of most nine- 
teenth century excesses except the scientific one, 
and to survey this more fruitfully than could 
the romantic Tennyson and Browning on the 
one hand, or his humanitarian younger contem- 
poraries on the other the same vision caught

glimpses of spiritual heights which "Earth" 
had not framed him for climbing. 

His somewhat Vesuvian attempts, in his na- 
ture poems, to mix those heights with Earth 
both by pouring them molten upon her bosom 
and by heaving her skyward to meet them half- 
way are accountable for that secondary picture 
of him, mentioned near the beginning, which 
one finds in biography and criticism. It has 
been the aim of this review to indicate how that 
portrait blends with the other " too too solid " 
one, also previously described, in the pages of the 
Letters. And the student of these will be able 
to trace the true picture through many details 
more intimately autobiographic than those which 
have here been dealt with. For in spite of the 
editor's modest assurance that "the collection 
is not meant to form a narrative of Meredith's 
life," it fulfills that function in a very large 
degree. And Meredith's reticence, though it 
has robbed curiosity of many palatable partic- 
ulars, has been by no means sufficiently stoical 
to cloak those larger effects of the chief happen- 
ings in his life which are most vital for the study 
of his personality. One discerns, for instance, 
that his unfortunate first marriage was much 
more important than has been surmised, not 
only for the composition of "Modern Love" 
but for the whole course of his thought and art. 
One notes, in fairly numerous passages, the sig- 
nificant combination in his attitude towards 
nature of healthy animalism with intellectual 
interest ; and the lack of what have been gen- 
erally considered the deepest emotions in regard 
to her. On the other hand, one finds in his 
letters to his oldest son an unexpected revela- 
tion of tenderness, the Spartan cloak falls 
quite away, perhaps primarily because the boy 
was saved to him from the wreck of the first 
marriage. One watches the recuperation of his 
emotional, and the revivifying of his artistic, 
powers when, several years after his first wife's 
death, he meets the woman who is to be his sec- 
ond wife. And one perceives that "A Reading 
of Earth," composed after her death, records 
the effects not merely of this event but of their 
whole life together. 

With the mood of this poem- cycle strong 
upon him, Meredith writes on March 16, 1888 : 

" If a man's work is to be of value, the best of him 
must be in it. I have written always with the percep- 
tion that there is no life but of the spirit; that the con- 
crete is really the shadowy ; yet that the way to spiritual 
life lies in the complete unfolding of the creature, not 
in the nipping of his passions. An outrage to Nature 
helps to extinguish his light. To the flourishing of the 
spirit, then, through the healthy exercise of the senses." 



In this definitive statement of his position, 
one notes the strangely Carlylean opening and 
then the almost comic descent toward the Mere- 
dithian close. If some future student of our 
author's works should run across this passage 
let us say, in the coming " age of concentration " 
when the outlines of the concept " spirit " shall 
have become fairly distinct again he would 
no doubt rub his eyes. He would then perhaps 
review his net impression of Meredith's poems 
and novels with the aim of discovering in it " the 
perception that there is no life but of the spirit ; 
that the concrete is really the shadowy." One's 
net impression of Meredith's works, and now of 
his letters also, has in the centre of it, not spirit, 
but "Tuck" a composite, social figure sym- 
bolic of things much larger than itself. At least, 
when the present reviewer had laid aside the two 
volumes of the Letters, he found that the follow- 
ing final sentences of an early note to Hardman 
remained most vivid in his mind : " I want 
restoration. Tuck being absent, I go to 
Nature, in her sublimest. Your loving, George 
Meredith." GEORGE ROY ELLIOTT. 



REGENERATING HUMANITY.* 



The hope of a regenerated humanity, and a 
world made fit to live in for all its inhabitants, 
is one that will not be subdued. It has haunted 
the imagination of the world's finest intellects, 
from Plato to Ruskin ; it has obsessed the 
thoughts of numberless thousands of plain men 
and women. Heroism and devotion have flowed 
without stint in its service; renunciation and 
sacrifice have been heaped upon its altar. And 
yet it may scarcely be said that we have ap- 
proached in any conspicuous degree toward a 
fulfillment of the dream. Is the problem insol- 
uble? Is the world's long-battered fort indeed 
unbreachable ? Must the hopes of men for their 
highest good continue forever to move fatuously 
about in worlds unrealized ? 

Mr. Havelock Ellis thinks not; and in his 
new book, "The Task of Social Hygiene," he 
unfolds what will seem to many the first con- 
structive scheme of social reform that carries 
with it the possibilities of even approximate 
realization. Here at last we are given a pro- 
gramme of social regeneration that is grounded 
not upon emotionalism or doctrinaire assump- 
tions, but upon the calm definite word of science, 
-a hope for the future that seems to bear the

sanction of Mother Nature herself. It is a plan 
of all-embracing comprehensiveness, dealing 
with function no less than with structure, with 
character no less than with environment, with 
men's souls no less than with their bodies. 

" All social hygiene, in its fullest sense, is but an 
increasingly complex and extended method of purifica- 
tion the purification of the conditions of life by sound 
legislation, the purification of our own minds by better 
knowledge, the purification of our hearts by a growing 
sense of responsibility, the purification of the race itself 
by an enlightened eugenics, consciously aiding Nature 
in her manifest effort to embody new ideals of life. . . . 
The questions of social hygiene, as here understood, go 
to the heart of life. It is the task of this hygiene not 
only to make sewers, but to re-make love, and to do 
both in the same large spirit of human fellowship, to 
ensure finer individual development and a larger social 
organization. At the one end social hygiene may be 
regarded as simply the extension of an elementary san- 
itary code; at the other end it seems to some to have 
in it the glorious freedom of a new religion." 

Here, then, is a gospel of the purification and 
ennoblement of life from within, an endeavor 
to attain a new joy and a new freedom for the 
individual based on social health and social order. 
Indeed so comprehensive is this plan of social 
hygiene that it practically supersedes what has 
hitherto been known as social reform, embracing 
not only the conditions of life but life itself, and 
dealing with its subject not in the old haphazard 
spirit of social reform but with the organized 
and systematic methods of modern biological 
science. Just as philanthropy has gradually 
evolved from the idea of alms-giving and amel- 
ioration to the modern spirit of prevention, so 
has social hygiene developed from the primitive 
notions of scavenging, drainage, etc., to the 
present-day conception of eugenics. The social 
and physical and biological sciences are to-day 
working hand in hand for the redemption of hu- 
manity ; and it is in the reaction of these forces 
upon the will and intelligence and sense of re- 
sponsibility of the individual that the spirit of 
social hygiene becomes operative. 

Mr. Ellis's book consists of eleven separate 
essays, nearly all of which have, we imagine, 
seen the light in one place or another during 
the past few years. But however seemingly 
detached in form and diverse in subject, they 
are yet bound together by a singular unity of 
spirit. An extended introduction traces the 
course of social reform during the past century, 
and summarizes the factors that enter into the 
new task of social hygiene. 

Believing, as every eugenist must, that the 
destiny of the race rests with woman, and that 
" the most vital problem before our civilization 



to-day is the problem of motherhood," Mr. Ellis 
naturally gives the foremost place in his volume 
to a detailed consideration of the part women 
will have to bear in social hygiene. In three 
chapters, constituting nearly a fourth of the en- 
tire book, he discusses " The Changing Status 
of Women," "The New Aspect of the Woman's 
Movement," and "The Emancipation of Women 
in Relation to Romantic -Love." While criti- 
cizing unsparingly the follies and mistakes that 
have characterized the suffrage movement in 
England, he yet affirms that the success of the 
cause is essential to a realization of our highest 
social aspirations. But the enforcing of woman's 
claims as a human being rather than as a woman 
is to him only half the task of the woman's move- 
ment, and perhaps not the most essential half. 
" The full fruition of that movement means that 
women . . . shall take their proper share in 
legislation for life, not as mere sexless human 
beings, but as women, and in accordance with 
the essential laws of their own nature as 
women." 

The following chapter, entitled " The Signi- 
ficance of a Falling Birth-Rate," deals with a 
subject familiar to us in America under the 
flashy designation of " race-suicide." It is a 
subject which, as Mr. Ellis says, has been 
usually left " to the ignorant preachers of the 
gospel of brute force, would-be patriots who 
desire their own country to increase at the cost 
of all other countries, not merely in ignorance 
of the fact that the crude birth-rate is not the 
index of increase, but reckless of the effect their 
desire, if fulfilled, would have upon all the 
higher and finer ends of living." With con- 
vincing logic, reinforced at every turn by the 
statistics and conclusions of unimpeachable 
authorities, Mr. Ellis proves that a falling birth- 
rate, instead of indicating degeneration and dis- 
aster, is in reality one of the most propitious 
signs of social progress, one of the most reassur- 
ing evidences of " that calculated forethought, 
that deliberate self-restraint for the attainment 
of ever more manifold ends, which in its outcome 
we term ' civilization.' " 

" < Increase and multiply,' was the legendary injunc- 
tion uttered on the threshold of an empty world. It is 
singularly out of place in an age in which the earth and 
the sea, if not indeed the very air, swarin with countless 
myriads of undistinguished and indistinguishable human 
creatures, until the beauty of the world is befouled and 
the glory of the Heavens bedimmed. To stem back that 
tide is the task now imposed on our heroism, to elevate 
and purify and refine the race, to introduce the ideal of 
quality in place of the ideal of quantity which has run 
riot so long, with the results we see."

In " Eugenics and Love " and " The Problem 
of Sexual Hygiene" are considered some of 
the more specific features of the eugenic pro- 
gramme. The problem of sexual hygiene seems 
to Mr. Ellis largely the problem of sexual en- 
lightenment for the young. It is pointed out 
that the greatest difficulty and danger in such 
enlightenment lie in the fact that those whom 
we most depend upon as teachers are themselves 
untaught. But notwithstanding this and other 
serious obstacles, sexual hygiene must be under- 
taken, and it will, "if wisely carried out, effect 
far more for public morals than all the legisla- 
tion in the world." 

There is no more valuable chapter in the vol- 
ume than that on "Immorality and the Law." 
Americans, particularly, are prone to believe in 
legislative short-cuts to the kingdom of heaven. 
But it is a matter of almost universal experience 
that attempts at moralization by law not only 
fail dismally to cure the evils aimed at, but 
actually tend to dignify and fortify those evils, 
and often result in furthering other evils far 
worse than those attacked. The spiritual evil 
of immorality, Mr. Ellis tells us, can never be 
suppressed by physical means, only by oppos- 
ing spiritual force to spiritual force may vic- 
tory be hoped for. In the moral sphere, "the 
generalizing hand of law can only injure and 
stain." 

A masterly statement of the forces now work- 
ing for international peace is contained in the 
chapter entitled, " The War against War." It is 
doubtful if a more sane and searching analysis 
of the subject was ever before given in the same 
limited space. Throwing sentimentalism over- 
board at the outset by stating that "the influ- 
ence of the Religion of Peace has in this matter 
been less than nil," Mr. Ellis goes on to sum- 
marize the various social and economic factors 
that are now warring so powerfully against war, 
and which are bound to triumph in the end. 

"The only question that remains and it is a question 
the future alone will solve is the particular point at 
which this ancient and overgrown stronghold of war, 
now being invested so vigorously from so many sides, 
will finally be overthrown, whether from within or from 
without, whether by its own inherent weakness, by the 
persuasive reasonableness of developing civilization, by 
the self-interest of the commercial and financial classes, 
or by the ruthless indignation of the proletariat. That 
is a problem still insoluble, but it is not impossible that 
some already living may witness its solution." 

Such subjects as "Religion and the Child" 
and "The Problem of an International Lan- 
guage " will seem at first blush rather unrelated 
to the general theme of the book. Yet in reality 



they bear a close connection. " Social Hygiene 
renders education a far larger and more delicate 
task than it has ever been before"; and "the 
organization of international methods of social 
intercourse between peoples of different tongues 
and unlike traditions" is one of "the tasks, 
difficult but imperative, which Social Hygiene 
presents and the course of modern civilization 
renders insistent." 

The old controversy between Individualism 
and Socialism is dealt with in the final chapter. 
After clearly and fairly stating the case for 
each camp, Mr. Ellis concludes that not only 
are both absolutely right, but that in reality 
they are scarcely opposed. " We have only to 
remember that the field of each is distinct. No 
one needs Individualism in his water supply, 
and no one needs Socialism in his religion." 
Each is complementary and indispensable to the 
other. " We socialize what we call our physical 
life in order that we may attain greater freedom 
for what we call our spiritual life." Thus the 
divergencies of the two schools are essential to 
the purposes of social hygiene. " The separate 
initiative and promulgation of the two tendencies 
encourages a much more effective action, and 
best promotes that final harmony of the two 
extremes which the finest human development 
needs." 

The foregoing is but a feeble summary of 
Mr. Ellis's volume, but it may serve to indicate 
something of the scope and significance and 
value of the book's substance. Of its splendid 
spirit, its sanity and insight, its liberality 
and flexibility of thought, its large sympathy, 
its comprehensive scientific and philosophical 
groundwork, its masterly interpretation of the 
past as a basis for speculations about the future, 
its convincing reasonableness, of all this we 
can give no adequate notion here, but must leave 
for the reader himself to discover and enjoy. 
It is an inspiring and reassuring volume, which 
deserves not one but several readings from 
everyone who takes anything more than a pre- 
datory interest in the social organism. More 
than any other book that we know of, it arouses 
in the reader an enthusiastic faith that the 
world may yet see a realization of the prayer 
of Paracelsus: 

"Make no more giants, God, 
But elevate the race at once ! We ask 
To put forth just our strength, our human strength, 
All starting fairly, all equipped alike, 
Gifted alike, all eagle-eyed, true-hearted 
See if we cannot beat thine angels yet ! "

MARK TWAIN.* 



"When I was younger," said Mark Twain in 
later life, " I could remember anything, whether 
it happened or not ; but I am getting old, and 
soon I shall remember only the latter." 

Hence the need of a more accurate and de- 
tailed account of his life than is furnished in the 
autobiographical chapters he himself wrote in 
his last years for the benefit of posterity. This 
need has been met by the elaborate three- volume 
biography prepared with infinite care by his au- 
thorized biographer, Mr. Albert Bigelow Paine, 
who has devoted six years to the work, journey- 
ing half-way around the world to trace the great 
humorist's footsteps and visit the haunts fre- 
quented by him in different lands, and for four 
years of the six living in close daily intercourse 
with him. The result is a book so filled with 
the spirit of Mark Twain as to vie in interest 
with his own works and to furnish an extent and 
variety of entertainment hardly to be found in 
any other recent biography. It is certainly one 
of the notable books of its class. 

It was over the billiard-table that our Boswell 
became best acquainted with his Johnson ; here, 
as he says, "the disparity of ages no longer 
existed, other discrepancies no longer mattered. 
The pleasant land of play is a democracy where 
such things do not count." And further: 

"To recall all the humors and interesting happenings 
of those early billiard-days would be to fill a large vol- 
ume. I can preserve no more than a few characteristic 
phases. 

" He was not an even-tempered player. When the 
balls were perverse in their movements and his aim un- 
steady, he was likely to become short with his opponents 
critical and even fault-finding. Then presently a 
reaction would set in, and he would be seized with 
remorse. He would become unnecessarily gentle and 
kindly even attentive placing the balls as I knocked 
them into the pockets, hurrying from one end of the 
table to render this service, endeavoring to show in 
every way except by actual confession in words that he 
was sorry for what seemed to him, no doubt, an unworthy 
display of temper, unjustified irritation. 

" Naturally this was a mood that I enjoyed less than 
that which had induced it. I did not wish him to 
humble himself; I was willing that he should be severe, 
even harsh, if he felt so inclined; his age, his position, 
his genius entitled him to special privileges; yet I am 
glad, as I remember it now, that the other side revealed 
itself, for it completes the sum of his great humanity. 

" Indeed, he was always not only human, but super- 
human; not only a man, but superman. Nor does this 
term apply only to his psychology. In no other human

being have I ever seen such physical endurance. I was 
comparatively a young man, and by no means an invalid ; 
but many a time, far in the night, when i was ready to 
drop with exhaustion, he was still as fresh and buoyant 
and eager for the game as at the moment of beginning. 
He smoked and smoked continually, and followed the 
endless track around the billiard-table with the light 
step of youth. At three or four o'clock in the morning 
he would urge just one more game, and would taunt 
me for my weariness." 

This intimate personal relation between the 
two it was worth while to illustrate even by a 
somewhat extended quotation. To the biog- 
rapher " the association was invaluable ; it drew 
from him a thousand long-forgotten incidents; 
it invited a stream of picturesque comments and 
philosophies; it furnished the most intimate 
insight into his character." It has been said 
by those who knew Mark Twain well that the 
culmination of his genius was reached only in 
these unpremeditated bursts of oral discourse, 
as splendid in their combination of imagery and 
poetry and philosophy, of humor and pathos and 
deep human feeling, as they were impossible to 
reproduce afterward on paper. This rich hu- 
manity of the man his biographer has fully 
recognized and has, to a marked degree, put 
into the pages that picture his life. 

The main outlines of Mark Twain's life- 
history are by this time known to all the world, 
and need not here be sketched. Space can 
better be utilized in conveying, by allusion and 
quotation, some idea of the wealth of variously 
interesting matter that goes to fill Mr. Paine's 
three ample volumes. Some specimen chapters 
have already seen the light, in serial publication, 
but they hardly skim even the cream of the work 
as a whole. In the flashes of light thrown by 
the biographer's pen on certain less familiar 
sides of the many-sided humorist and philoso- 
pher, one cannot fail to note his emphatic likes 
and dislikes in literature. That this master of 
luminous prose should have kindled with enthu- 
siasm over the tortuous poetry of Browning is 
rather surprising ; but having accepted the f act,, 
one is prepared to hear that he was equally fond 
of Meredith, when, disappointing expectation 
again, he shows himself quite the reverse. The 
Meredithian characters were to him ingeniously 
contrived puppets, not human beings ; and when 
"Diana of the Crossways" was read aloud to 
him he was likely to say: "It doesn't seem to 
me that Diana lives up to her reputation. The 
author keeps telling us how smart she is, how 
brilliant, but I never seem to hear her say 
anything smart or brilliant. Read me some of 
Diana's smart utterances." Most noteworthy

and most surprising of all was his passionate 
embrace of the Baconian craze. One would sup- 
pose that the barefoot scapegrace of those early 
Missouri days which he has so well depicted in 
"Tom Sawyer" would have been the last to 
deny, on coming into his own, the possibility of 
the Stratford poacher's developing into a great 
poet and dramatist. And yet, in conversation 
with Mr. Paine he declared that Shakespeare 
could not have written the plays bearing his 
name. " There 's evidence that he couldn't," he 
said. "It required a man with the fullest legal 
equipment to have written them. When you 
have read Greenwood's book you will see how 
untenable is any argument for Shakespeare's 
authorship." But we have Mark Twain's little 
volume, "Is Shakespeare Dead?" and it is 
enough to enjoy the literary charm of it without 
puzzling further over the reason of its author's 
heresy. Let us pass to things more truly char- 
acteristic of the man. Here is a letter writ- 
ten by him to his lecture-manager, Redpath, in 
the days when the author of " The Innocents 
Abroad " was achieving his first great popularity 
as a public entertainer on the platform : 

" DEAR RED, I am different from other women ; my 
mind changes oftener. People who have no mind can 
easily be steadfast and firm, but when a man is loaded 
down to the guards with it, as I am, every heavy sea of 
foreboding or inclination, maybe of indolence, shifts 
the cargo. See? Therefore, if you will notice, one 
week I am likely to give rigid instructions to confine 
me to New England; the next week send me to Arizona; 
the next week withdraw my name ; the next week give 
you full, untrammeled swing; and the week following 
modify it. You must try to keep the run of my mind, 
Redpath ; it is your business, being the agent, and it was 
always too many for me. . . . Yours, MARK." 

The interesting though somewhat distressing 
story of Mark Twain's stupefying oratorical 
effort at the Whittier dinner in Boston, Decem- 
ber 17, 1877, is told more fully than it has ever 
been told before, with letters to and from the 
chief actors in that little tragedy or tragi- 
comedy, as at this distance of time we can regard 
it. The good humor shown and evidently felt 
by the Olympian trinity whom the tactless 
speech was supposed to have affronted helped 
to rescue the penitent speaker from despair. It 
appears, also, that the most revered of that 
trinity, Emerson, failed to take in a single syl- 
lable of the speech, having lapsed temporarily 
into that happy oblivion which more and more 
held him in unconsciousness of outer happen- 
ings toward the end of his life. A kind letter 
from his daughter Ellen to Mrs. Clemens, in in- 
direct response to one from Clemens to Emerson, 
is made public in the book. It must have greatly 



soothed the whole family. Concerning the un- 
fortunate speech itself and Mark Twain's later 
alternating opinions of it, Mr. Paine well says : 
" Of course the first of these impressions, the verdict 
of the fresh mind uninfluenced by the old conception, 
was the more correct one. The speech was decidedly 
out of place in that company. The skit was harmless 
enough, but it was of the Comstock grain. It lacked 
refinement, and, what was still worse, it lacked humor, 
at least the humor of a kind suited to that long-ago 
company of listeners. It was another of those grievous 
mistakes which genius (and not talent) can make, for 
genius is assort of possession.. The individual is per- 
vaded, dominated for a time by an angel or an imp, and 
he seldom, of himself, is able to discriminate between 
his controls. A literary imp was always lying in wait 
for Mark Twain ; the imp of the burlesque, tempting 
him to do the outre, the outlandish, the shocking thing. 
It was this that Olivia Clemens had to labor hardest 
against: the cheapening of his own high purpose with 
an extravagant false note, at which sincerity, conviction, 
and artistic harmony took wings and fled away. Notably 
he did a good burlesque now and then, but his fame 
would not have suffered if he had been delivered alto- 
gether from his besetting temptations." 

The debt that both his public and his fame 
owe to his faithful censor, Mrs. Clemens, is lar- 
ger than many persons have ever suspected. The 
piles of manuscript that he uncomplainingly 
threw aside at her bidding, must have far ex- 
ceeded in bulk those other piles that went to 
the printer and contributed to the world's lasting 
entertainment. One other brief selection from 
the biographer's few critical comments on Mark 
Twain's books is worth giving to call renewed 
attention to that exquisite creation of the 
author's finer genius, the nobly conceived " Joan 
of Arc." 

" But this is just the wonder of Mark Twain's Joan. 
She is a saint ; she is rare, she is exquisite, she is all that 
is lovely, and she is a human being besides. Considered 
from every point of view, Joan of Arc is Mark Twain's 
supreme literary expression, the loftiest, the most deli- 
cate, the most luminous example of his work. It is so 
from the first word of its beginning, that wonderful 
' Translator's Preface,' to the last word of the last chap- 
ter, where he declares that the figure of Joan with the 
martyr's crown upon her head shall stand for patriotism 
through all time." 

The drama of the strange and yet always 
intensely real and human life unrolled in Mr. 
Paine's three volumes must be read as a con- 
nected whole to be best enjoyed. Snatches and 
fragments seem to do it injustice. Yet it may 
be not out of place here to quote from the 
author's own account of his memorable meeting 
with the subject of his book when the writing 
of that book was first proposed to him. The 
occasion was a dinner given to Mark Twain in 
New York. 

"The night of January 5, 1906, remains a memory 
apart from other dinners. Brander Matthews presided,

and Gilder was there, and Frank Millet and Willard 
Metcalf and Robert Reid, and a score of others; some 
of them are dead now, David Munro among them. It 
so happened that my seat was nearly facing the guest 
of the evening, who, by custom of The Players, is 
placed at the side and not at the end of the long table. 
He was no longer frail and thin, as when I had first 
met him. He had a robust, rested look ; his complexion 
had the tints of a miniature painting. Lit by the glow 
of the shaded candles, relieved against the dusky 
richness of the walls, he made a picture of striking 
beauty. One could not take his eyes from it, and to 
one guest at least it stirred the farthest memories. I 
suddenly saw the interior of a farm-house sitting-room 
in the Middle West, where I had first heard uttered 
the name of Mark Twain, and where night after night 
a group gathered around the evening lamp to hear the 
tale of the first pilgrimage, which, to a boy of eight, 
had seemed only a wonderful poem and fairy tale. To 
Charles Harvey Genung, who sat next to me, I whis- 
pered something of this, and how, during the thirty-six 
years since then, no other human being to me had 
meant what Mark Twain had meant in literature, 
in life, in the ineffable thing which means more than 
either, and which we call ' inspiration,' for lack of a 
truer word. Now here he was, just across the table. 
It was the fairy tale come true. Genung said: 'You 
should write his life.'" 

And so in the end it came about that this 
writer from the Middle West wrote the life of 
that other writer from the Middle West, and 
he has written it so fully and satisfactorily that 
no one need in the future go over the same 
ground again. Mark Twain will of course con- 
tinue to be written about and talked about, 
and his books will form the subjects of critical 
comment and expert appreciation, to which the 
present biography happily does not pretend to 
devote itself ; but the authoritative life of the 
great humorist has been written, and in a way 
to insure a reading hardly less wide than that 
which Mark Twain's own books receive. In 
wealth of illustration and other details of its 
make-up, the book will not disappoint.

ENGLAND AND THE AMERICAN 
REVOLUTION.* 



Among the many English men of affairs 
who have found time and leisure to satisfy a 
passion for historic research, Sir George Otto 
Trevelyan holds an honored place. Sir George 
was for many years an influential member of 
Parliament. He has also held ministerial offices 
of high rank, and was at one time a leader in 
the councils of the Liberal party. When the 

* GEORGE THE THIRD AND CHARLES JAMES Fox. Being 
the Concluding Part of "The American Revolution." By 
the Right Hon. Sir George Otto Trevelyan, Bart., O.M. In 
two volumes. Volume I. New York: Longmans, Green, & Co. 



party split in 1886 on the question of Irish 
home rule, Mr. Trevelyan was one of the chiefs 
among the Liberal -Unionist seceders. Since 
then he has gradually withdrawn from public 
activities and has given his time to literary 
pursuits, especially to the study of history in 
the eighteenth century. 

In our own country he is, perhaps, best 
known as the author of a history of the Amer- 
ican Revolution, three volumes of which have 
appeared under that title. But still earlier, as 
long ago as 1880, he had published "The Early 
History of Charles James Fox." He now gives 
us a continuation of both these ventures in a 
work entitled " George the Third and Charles 
James Fox." It is planned to publish this in 
two volumes, the first of which has appeared. 

It happens frequently that a title does not 
accurately describe the contents of a book, and 
such is the case in the present instance. Fox 
is not unusually prominent in the narrative ; his 
relationship with George III. is discussed only 
incidentally; and the American Revolution is- 
only one of the many subjects discussed. The 
volume is a military and political history of 
England during the years 1778 to 1780, a 
period when England stood alone against nearly 
all Europe, facing hostility, active or passive,, 
commercial or military, almost everywhere. 

The author's position with respect to the war 
in America is well known: the fight for self- 
government in England was won in America; 
the system of personal government that George 
III. strove to fasten upon the English nation 
was discredited by his failure to conquer the 
Americans and his purposes were defeated- 
The effort to coerce the colonies was not only 
unwise but unjust, and the government should 
not have forced matters to the issue of war. 
But after hostilities had become a fact, the war 
should have been fought in a different spirit. 
It was carried on by a group of corrupt and 
incapable men whose inefficiency and stupid 
carelessness stir the author almost to the point 
of anger. Especially does he find incompetence 
in the admiralty ; and as a former secretary in 
that department, Sir George must be presumed 
to know what an efficient management of the 
navy should imply. Lord Sandwich is charac- 
terized as "the most negligent administrator 
who ever sat at the head of the table in the 
admiralty Board-room." " When Keppel's mes- 
senger arrived in the last days of June of 1778, 
bringing the momentous intelligence that the 
British fleet had retired from before Brest and 
had got back to Portsmouth, neither the First

Lord nor the Secretary of the Admiralty could 
be found to unseal the dispatches." And this 
was in a department where watchfulness never 
ceases, and sleep is almost unknown. 

Against this negligence and corruption 
Charles James Fox raised his voice again and 
again, and a marvellously effective voice it was. 
The picture that is given of the mighty debater 
is sympathetic in every line. Fox was no longer 
the young profligate ; the period of his reforma- 
tion had begun. 

" He ceased to gamble. He lived contented within 
his slender means. His home-life with the woman 
whom he loved . . . was admired by his uncensorious 
contemporaries as a model of domestic affection, and 
mutual sympathy in the insatiable enjoyment of good 
literature and quiet rural pleasures. Nothing at last 
remained of the old Charles James Fox except the 
frankness and friendliness, the inexhaustible good na- 
ture, the indescribable charm of manner, and the utter 
absence of self-importance and self-consciousness, which 
combined to make him, at every period of his existence, 
the best fellow in the world." 

The author also describes the great triumphs of 
Fox in the House of Commons ; but they were 
personal triumphs and meant little for the cause 
that he represented, for the majority had sold 
its conscience to the king. 

Of the Earl of Chatham we have the conven- 
tional picture. In the intellectual make-up of 
George III., the author finds a few admirable 
qualities, but very few. Much attention is given 
to the king's absolutist ideas and to the venal 
methods that he employed to secure his author- 
ity. For Burke, Sir George professes the great- 
est admiration. " So full and cultured a mind 
as Burke's, so vivid an imagination and so 
intense and catholic an interest in all human 
affairs, past and present, have never been 
placed at the service of the state by anyone ex- 
cept Cicero." The author also bears testimony 
to the abilities of Admiral Howe and by way of 
contrast to the incompetence of the French ad- 
mirals, particularly D'Estaing. But the only 
man whose greatness was unalloyed, whose deeds 
were above criticism, was George Washington. 

The closing chapter in the volume, in which 
is discussed the treason of Arnold and the death 
of Andre, is one of great interest. Without 
showing any sympathy for the traitor, Mr. 
Trevelyan fully appreciates Benedict Arnold's 
great abilities in the field, and has hard words 
for the American Congress which unjustly 
wounded the general's over-sensitive pride and 
thus strengthened him in his disloyal purposes. 
Full justice is done to the traitor's estimable 
and innocent wife. 

" Arnold was the waster; and his wife, during a hard 



and life-long struggle with adversity, showed herself a 
notable saver and manager for the protection of her hus- 
band's financial credit, and of her children's future. And 
the beginning and end of Margaret Arnold's reputed dis- 
affection to the American cause was that as a girl she 
had danced minuets with royal officers, and that as a 
married woman she had refused to exclude from her 
ball-room the wives and daughters of Loyalists and 
Tories." 

The importance of Arnold's defection, for the 
American cause, is clearly brought out. " The 
revelation of Arnold's treachery created a power- 
ful and lasting reaction in American opinion." 
The results were not despair but horror, indig- 
nation, and patriotic fervor. The author is also 
careful to bring out the fact that while Arnold 
after the war apparently enjoyed the favor of 
the English court, " London society set its face 
sternly and inexorably against him. . . . In poli- 
tical and fashionable circles he was shunned by 
most of the Whigs, and by many Tories." 

Much has been written in recent years about 
the American war and the conditions that gave 
birth to revolution ; but this literature is appar- 
ently unknown to the present author, at least 
he ignores its conclusions. We are, for instance, 
told once more that the king dismissed Pitt to 
make room for Bute, an old view that Von 
Ruville in his great biography of Pitt has 
clearly shown to be erroneous. Mr. Trevelyan 
cannot be ignorant of the fact that recent En- 
glish students who look at history from the view- 
point of the modern imperialist have come to 
regard the struggle in America as the result of 
an effort to organize the British empire, which 
successful warfare had given almost magical 
growth ; but he seems not to have accepted these 
views. And perhaps it is too much to expect 
that the nephew of Lord Macaulay should accept 
and exploit the opinions of the imperialistic 
Tories. LAURENCE M. LARSON. 



MAN AND CIVILIZATION.* 



It is, perhaps, by this time, a commonplace 
thought that we are passing through a period 
of social and cultural change in comparison 
with which the French Revolution was a simple 
and easily accomplished transition. Certainly 
we lack the faith and optimism with which the 
sanguine spirits of that day regarded their 
reconstructive programmes. In fact the more 
reflective spirits of to-day are apt, as they survey 

*MAIN CURRENTS OF MODERN THOUGHT. A Study of 
the Spiritual and Intellectual Movements of the Present 
Day. Translated from the German of Rudolf Eucken, by 
Meyrick Booth. New York : Charles Scribner's Sons.

[Oct. 16, 



the present course of civilization, to cry with the 
late William Vaughn Moody : 

"... Does she know her port, 
Though she goes so far about? 
Or blind astray, does she make her sport 
To brazen and chance it out. 
I watfhed her when her captains passed: 
She were better captainless. 
Men in the cabin, before the mast, 
But some were reckless and some aghast, 
And some sat gorged at mess." 

Such an extremity as this should be philoso- 
phy's opportunity, and the extremity has come 
home in an unique measure to one present-day 
philosopher, Rudolf Eucken of Jena. He is 
known to English readers already by some half 
dozen books, notably " The Problem of Human 
Life," "Life's Basis and Life's Ideal," and 
"The Truth of Religion," all of which have 
very recently been translated into English, and 
for the writing of which the author has been 
awarded a Nobel Prize for Literature. Eucken 
is not a system builder, not a philosopher of the 
old argumentative and intellectualistic type, but 
a passionate and powerful preacher, a theologian 
in one sense, and a deeply religious spirit. 
Withal, he has the historic sense and the critical 
sense both highly developed. Consequently we 
may expect to find in his work valuable estima- 
tions of past and present tendencies, thorough 
destructive analyses of the attempted solutions 
of our world riddles and life riddles, a strenuous 
insistence on the rights of the spirit ; and we find 
all this in greater measure than any explicit and 
reasoned world view ready to be assimilated by 
the understanding of the seeker. 

The situation of human life at the present 
day as Eucken sees it is almost as gloomy as 
that portrayed in Moody 's lines. He sees the 
ship of life advancing, indeed, but into danger- 
ous seas. The situation which he sketches is 
briefly as follows. The great scientific and 
technological advances of recent years have given 
man an unprecedented mastery over the world 
without. His experiences have been multiplied 
a hundred fold. His powers over nature have 
increased to the point of practical mastery. But 
that mastery has been gained at the expense of 
the old idea that man was central in the universe. 
The laws that he discovers are immediately seen 
to cover himself and his activities. Particularly 
the idea of evolution exhibits man as the product 
of a material environment, struggling with it 
and his fellows for material goods. Nature be- 
comes, in the words of Schwegler, an uuspirit- 
ualized mass, and an object for man only as it 
is subservient to his sensuous greeds and needs. 



This situation may be met in various ways. 
The most logical way, and the one which has 
been most energetically pushed, is the socialistic 
doctrine of work. If we accept this doctrine, 
" Morality becomes altruism, a working for the 
good of society ; art finds no higher task than 
the sympathetic and accurate representation of 
social conditions ; education endeavors rather to 
elevate the general level of culture than to de- 
velop anything individual." But is there any 
reason in things for the individual willingly to 
allow himself thus to be used for the good of the 
whole, as means and not end? Certainly not 
on the naturalistic hypothesis. Briefly, Eucken 
condemns all merely socialistic solutions of the 
life problem because they first in theory reduce 
man to an animal (not to put too fine a point 
upon it) and then call upon him in practice to 
act as a man and a "soldier of the common 
good." No, the more logical way of meeting a 
life situation which is condemned to the realm 
of nature is to refuse to do other than make the 
best of things for one's self. This position has 
also been pretty thoroughly exploited under 
various forms of aesthetic individualism. In 
this scheme of life, art is divorced from morality 
and made supreme. In this view the content of 
art is set aside as being irrelevant, and form is 
hailed as its all in all. But form in itself only 
appeals to the senses, and confers no inner free- 
dom. " Genuine independence is to be found 
only when the creative work proceeds solely from 
an inner necessity of the artist's own nature. 
But this cannot take place unless there is some- 
thing to say, nay, to reveal. Mere virtuosity 
knows no such necessity." 

Let us glance at one more tendency of the 
day before passing to the constructive contribu- 
tion which Eucken makes to the solution of the 
world problem. That tendency is the pragmatic 
movement which is at one with Eucken in its 
reaction against intellectualism, materialism, 
and mere aestheticism. Pragmatism, of course, 
would estimate truth by its service to humanity. 
Does the god idea seem to function well in 
society? If it does, then a god let us have. 
In his criticism of this movement Eucken best 
exhibits his own position. With its insistence 
upon action as against thought as the primary 
concern of life, Eucken is in agreement. But 
obviously pragmatism is humanistic. It cannot 
go beyond man even when it reaches out to god. 

" When the good of the individual and humanity 
becomes the highest aim and the guiding principle, truth 
sinks to the level of a merely utilitarian opinion. This 
is destructive of inner life. All the power of conviction 
that truth can possess must disappear the moment it is

seen to be a mere means. . . . Finally, the chief aim 
and end of pragmatism the success and enrichment 
of human life is as an end by no means free from 
objection. By human life is here meant civilized life on 
the broad scale; but in order to regard this life as so 
surely good, one must be inspired by the optimistic 
enthusiasm for human culture which was more character- 
istic of earlier ages than it is of our own. Is this life, 
when taken as in itself the final thing, really worth all 
the trouble and excitement, all the work and effort, all 
the sufferings and sacrifices that it costs ? " 

Life can only be worth while, thinks Eucken, 
if there is more in it than pragmatism can 
guarantee, only if the life of man be taken 
up into a realm of reality which transcends the 
human and is independent of it. This realm is 
no merely human affair, but represents a new 
stage in reality into which man who is, under 
one aspect, a being of nature, enters and thereby 
becomes more than a being of nature, becomes 
a being having his dependence on, and suste- 
nance from, the eternal itself. 

This is the conception which dictates Eucken's 
stalwart individualism. As against those think 
ers who claim that man can only enter into spiri- 
tual life as a member of society, who claim 
that the emotional lift which the presence of a 
similarly minded and intentioned crowd gives to 
each member of it is at once the basis and the 
end of religion, Eucken holds that for the 
individual to lean on crowd or on State is to 
impoverish himself. Eucken is not an advocate 
of what he calls " mere individual freedom," as 
he has for man as a mere "specimen of a spe- 
cies " nothing but contempt. But the mutual 
relationships of individuals "must proceed from 
their own personal decision and free agreement." 
And, "failing this free unity the tendency is 
more and more for men to fall back on the State." 
The reason for this is "because the individual, 
on account of the breaking down of traditional 
relationships and the thorough insecurity of his 
own position, yearns after some sort of firm 
hold, because he wishes to see his existence in 
some way valued and protected by the whole." 
And "what shaping of human conditions will 
result therefrom lies for the time being in pro- 
found obscurity." With the cry of democracy 
for this security, and also for a share in culture, 
Eucken sympathizes, but in the ability of a 
democracy to operate in anything but a "vul- 
garizing, shallowing, narrowing, and negating 
fashion" unless it be led by strong individual- 
ities, themselves the fruits of spiritual culture, 
he has little faith. He sees such a democracy 
degenerate into a sleek, materialistic type of life 
which shall be destructive of all spiritual values 
and hence self-destructive. 



We may well admit with Eucken that human- 
istic culture as it exhibits itself before us 
to-day is nothing to boast about. We may agree 
with his denunciations of unmoral art, unspiri- 
tual work, and uninspired might of numbers, as 
means and methods of solving the problems of 
life. If we do this we must either admit hu- 
manity's defeat in its struggle for spiritual ex- 
istence, or we must accept some such solution 
of the question as Eucken offers us in his idea 
of the independent spiritual life. But the 
reader who reaches this point in agreement 
with him will be disappointed with the working 
out of that conception itself. He will wander 
from volume to volume of Eucken's works 
looking for a really clear and understandable 
statement of this life. He will read that it is 
achievable by man but not created by him, that 
it is a personal inner world and yet that it is 
cosmic. The transition to it he will not be able 
to see. He will probably conclude that Eucken 
takes it for granted because he feels that we 
need it. But if the reader is content to give 
his own interpretation to Eucken's phrase, and 
to enter rather into Eucken's spirit in uttering 
it, he will find him not only an efficient guide 
to the maze of modern life but one who on the 
whole enables us to transcend the disillusion- 
ments to which he exposes us in his critique of 
our cultural limitations.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



The lure of Written from a life-long knowledge

a bookseller's and love of the Bookselling Trade, 
standpoint. Mr. Joseph Shaylor's collection of 

articles entitled "The Fascination of Books, with 
Other Papers on Books and Bookselling" (Putnam) 
has a certain practical, observational, time-tested 
quality that commands the reader's respectful atten- 
tion and gives him the comfortable feeling of having 
both feet always on the solid ground. The eighteen 
chapters deal with questions interesting to book- 
publishers, book-sellers, and book-readers alike, and 
are at least partly collected from leading English 
magazines and reviews and the "Encyclopaedia 
Britannica." The glimpses that the author gives of 
book-publishing customs in the pre-copyright past 
(before 1710) impress one with the number and 
magnitude of the abuses formerly flourishing for 
the enrichment of the unscrupulous. A popular 
writer's name became common property, a label 
affixed by the bookseller at pleasure to any produc- 
tion in order to expedite its sale. The book-trade is 
not even yet blamelessly conducted, but its progress 
toward high ethical standards is seen to have been 
considerable. Mr. Shaylor gives the bookseller no

mean rank. He says: "Booksellers may console 
themselves by being classed with those who follow 
literature as a profession, and of whom Froude has 
said, ' It happens to be the only occupation in which 
wages are not given in proportion to the goodness 
of the work done.' " His paper on " Some Old Li- 
braries" might at first glance mislead by its title; 
it discusses, not libraries as the word is commonly 
understood, but certain early Victorian series of 
books, such as the Parlour Library, the Railway 
Library, the Popular Library of Modern Authors, 
and others. In a timely chapter on "The Use and 
Abuse of Book Titles" the author fails to set the 
seal of his disapproval on that too common abuse 
whereby the same English or American book appears 
under different names on the two sides of the Atlantic 
a source of vexation to booksellers, as well as to 
librarians and others, which he doubtless deplores. 
Another cause of bewilderment to the trade is the 
heedless ordering of a book by the heading prefixed 
to a critic's review of it an inadvertence for which 
Mr. Shaylor does not blame the reviewer, though 
he regrets its frequency and the trouble and loss of 
time it occasions to the busy bookseller. A pleasing 
portrait of this cultured and courteous English book- 
connoisseur faces the title-page of his informing 
and entertaining volume. 

The latent Life The perennial interest which has 
of Napoleon's always surrounded everything per- 
taining to Napoleon clings in no 
small degree to the name of his first wife, the 
Empress Josephine, whose career was so closely 
bound up with his down to 1810, the year of their 
divorce. The latest narrative of her life is from the 
pen of Baron de Me*neval, published in an English 
translation by Messrs. Lippincott. It curiously pur- 
ports to be an "autobiography," and the publishers' 
announcement states that "the author has set him- 
self the task of justifying, by means of authentic 
documents in his possession, the evidences of respect 
and esteem rendered to the memory of the Empress 
Josephine by the Duke of Reichstadt" (Napoleon's 
son by Marie Louise of Austria). Notwithstanding 
the fact that Mdneval's sources include many letters 
and other documents hitherto unpublished, it cannot 
be said that he has greatly increased the store of 
information already available and utilized in such 
popular sketches as those by Miss Ida Tarbell 
and Miss Harriet A. Guerber, and especially in the 
standard Life of Josephine by Aubenas (1859). 
These facts, however, he has re-assembled and added 
to ; and from them he has painted a pleasing picture 
of the graceful and affectionate woman who held 
for so long the heart of the world's conqueror. He 
admits her extravagance and her occasional indis- 
cretions ; but he gives her the benefit of every doubt, 
and reserves his invectives, naturally enough, for 
Marie Louise, who supplanted her, and for Fouch^, 
the treacherous minister of police, who probably 
deserves all the odium that has been heaped upon 
him. Napoleon is treated with great consideration 



and respect, and is deprived of none of the halo 
with which most Frenchmen have invested him. 
The English version, by Mr. D. D. Fraser, is gener- 
ally smooth and idiomatic ; but the proof-reading has 
been, in some places, very carelessly done. "Anti- 
podes," on page 18, should probably be " Antilles "; 
and some especially unfortunate slips are found in 
the first two sentences of the book, in which the 
heroine is twice referred to by the masculine pro- 
noun, and Louis XVI. is made to do duty for his 
predecessor. _ 



Some Salem days when the old wooden 

ship-owners of whalers and merchantmen are be- 
the olden time, coming more and more of a rarity 
in our New England ports, such a book as Mr. 
Robert E. Peabody's "Merchant Venturers of Old 
Salem " (Houghton) serves as a welcome reminder 
of that vanished era of American ship-building and 
ocean-voyaging before the whole habitable globe and 
navigable sea had been made an open and familiar 
book to every school-boy. In his volume, which is 
described in its sub-title as " A History of the Com- 
mercial Voyages of a New England Family to the 
Indies and Elsewhere in the XVIII Century," the 
author traces the business fortunes of the historic 
Derby family of Salem, and incidentally brings in 
other shipmasters and navigators, notably Captain 
Nathaniel Silsbee, Nathaniel Bowditch, and Richard 
Cleveland, grandfather of President Cleveland. It 
was Elias Hasket Derby who raised the family name 
to preeminence in Salem by his mastery of the busi- 
ness of ocean trading, and a picture of the mansion 
he built for the enjoyment of his later opulent years, 
after the vexations and losses of Revolutionary times 
were well in the past, shows him to have been a 
grandee of more than parochial prominence. Atten- 
tion is called, in the closing pages, to the debt which 
our country's growth and prosperity owe to these 
early ship-owners who pushed their commerce into 
all parts of the world and made the new nation 
widely known and respected. A still greater debt, 
it might have been added, do we owe these enter- 
prising traders for the new thought and wider out- 
look which they brought into the narrow intellectual 
life of Puritan New England a stimulus that had 
a direct bearing on the educational and religious 
development of that corner of our country. Mr. 
Peabody's preface is written at Marblehead, and 
from this and other indications the book appears to 
have come into being in the very atmosphere of 
those traditions it so agreeably hands down to future 
readers. Its portraits and other illustrations are of 
peculiar interest. _ 
A Nietzschean D r . Q. T. Wrench, a London physi- 
S5Kf cian, in a large book of over five hun- 
in government, dred pages entitled "The Mastery of 
Life " (Kennerley) has written a " review of the 
history of civilization " with the aim of showing that 
the conditions under which man has always shown 
the most positive attitude toward life have always 
been the conditions of paternalism (which word with 



1912.] 



THE DIAL 



297 



Dr. Wrench is synonymous with Nietzschean aristoc- 
racy), and that democracy is a perversion of the 
civilized mind from which the consciousness of all 
our men who are fitted to rule must he purged before 
further progress or rather before any progress 
can be made. Dr. Wrench first gives reviews of the 
histories and social psychologies of Egypt, Greece, 
Rome, the Romanesque period, Gothic influences, 
Germany and England, the Renaissance, the Roman 
Renaissance, and Dutch and Saxon Art. Presum- 
ably, in these historic sketches, the author resists 
any temptation to be guided in his necessarily partial 
selection of facts and aspects by his preconceived 
thesis. Coming down to later times, he character- 
izes our progress since the industrial revolution of 
the early nineteenth century as a " Gadarene prog- 
ress " and devotes a chapter to showing it up as such. 
In many ways, it has been just that ; but unfor- 
tunately Dr. Wrench seems unable to separate the 
Gadarene from the divine elements in this imme- 
diately past and contemporary drama. Pragmatism, 
for instance, he attacks as a " dollar philosophy," 
and he accuses Professor James of "naively" saying 
that every idea has a dollar value. Of course, James 
never said this, and the expression he did use, " cash 
value," was very carefully guarded and explicitly 
limited to values which were of the spirit. The fact 
that so much of Dr. Wrench's indictment of democ- 
racy is true, is simply due to the fact that the in- 
dustrial revolution threw the government of things 
into the people's hands before any system of philos- 
ophy had succeeded in giving us a new set of moral 
values. To turn away from democracy at this date, 
and especially to turn to a crude interpretation of 
what Nietzsche may or may not have meant for 
Nietzsche was a mystic who spoke in parables is 
impossible. The hope of the future lies in clearly 
thinking out the problems of democracy and embrac- 
ing them in a consistent world-view which will again 
exhibit moral values in a supreme light. This, of 
course, is just what Dr. Wrench tries to do, except 
that he begins by denying democracy. Pragmatism, 
on the other hand, is an attempt to do this, by medi- 
ating spiritual values to democracy. If this can be 
done democracy is safe. But if there is no basis in 
reality for spiritual values but only merely subjective 
and aesthetic base, then we are not sure but that Dr. 
Wrench has made good his case against democracy. 
But in this latter case, his criterion of aristocracy, 
abjuring as it does mere fitness to survive as being 
a criterion of good, may be found difficult to 
establish. 



An English 
outline of 
German 
literature. 



When Professor J. G. Robertson con- 
densed his " History of German Lit- 
erature" (Blackwood, 1902) of fifty 
chapters and 635 pages into the present ''Outlines 
of the History of German Literature" (Putnam) of 
twenty-five chapters and 320 pages, he gave irre- 
futable testimony to the wisdom of Goethe's verse: 
"In der Beschrankung zeigt sich erst der Meister." 
The index of the original work tabulates eight hun- 



dred proper names and 260 topics and authorless 
works; that of the abridgment tabulates five hun- 
dred of the former and 160 of the latter. But 
Professor Robertson has not simply deleted ; he 
has rearranged, abridged his remarks on the great 
writers, omitted some of the lesser ones entirely, 
eliminated quotations and notes, added chronological 
tables of important events and works from the 
consecration of Wulfilas as Bishop of the Visigoths 
(341) to the death of Nietzsche (1900), and, what 
is very pleasing to the reader, completely reworded 
the whole. The tables, to be sure, add but little 
to those of Professor Nollen in the "Lake German 
Series," but their connection with the preceding 
text greatly increases their value. Barring a few 
instances of incorrect syllabification at the end of 
lines (pages 244, 251, 256), there are no faith- 
shaking misprints. The book abounds in first in- 
stances and superlatives: " Ludwigslied " (881) is 
the first German ballad, "Ruodlieb" (1030) the 
first German romance, Dietmar von Aist has given 
us the first German " Tagelied "; " Der arme Hein- 
rich"is one of the most charming idylls in mediaeval 
literature, Gyburg is the finest of all Wolfram's 
women, Murner is the most unscrupulous satirist 
in the whole range of German literature, Annette 
von Droste has written the finest German religious 
poetry of the nineteenth century, Nietzsche was the 
most gifted writer of the last generation, and so on 
through a very long list. The recapitulations and 
transitions are presented with really artistic skill. 
The language, generally clear, is at times queer, 
there are readers who do not like such expressions 
as "led to them being considered." The critical 
opinions are, on the whole, the result of sympathetic 
scholarship. 

In a tone of simple sincerity that 
holds the attention from the start, 
the author of " One of the Multitude " 
(Dodd) tells the story of his painful struggle upward 
from slum life in East-End London to respectability 
and comparative prosperity. Absolute truth in every 
detail except proper names is vouched for by the 
writer, who calls himself George Acorn, and by his 
literary sponsor, Mr. Arthur Christopher Benson, 
who contributes a thoughtful introduction touching 
on some of the social problems suggested by the nar- 
rative. It is just such a heart-stirring and thought- 
evoking chronicle as that with which Mr. George 
Meek, under the sponsorship of Mr. H. G. Wells, 
arrested the attention of the English-reading world 
two years ago. The confessions of a cockney Owen 
Kildare, the publishers not unfitly call the book, 
" a human document that compels attention from its 
grim fidelity to the life it describes." The wonder 
of it all is that one born and reared amid such de- 
grading surroundings could have not only conceived 
the possibility of things so much higher and better, 
but remained true to that early vision until it began 
to assume some sort of blessed reality. The heart- 
breaking struggle to attain to this reality is told with

an unconscious art that makes the book a veritable 
work of literature. A high ideal, a firm will, and 
a sense of humor seem to have been important factors 
in the ultimate working-out of the writer's salvation 
through his own independent efforts. Much also he 
must have owed to his love of reading : Dickens 
and George Eliot he especially mentions among those 
whose books furnished him a refuge from the hate- 
ful realities of his material environment. Cabinet- 
making, chosen by him as his trade in early youth 
and followed with industry and skill, was the ladder 
by which he climbed at last to the possession of a 
pleasant home and family, with cheering hopes for 
the future. Again we have illustrated in this unpre- 
tentious history the familiar truth that no human 
life, if faithfully related, can prove devoid of very 
real and living interest. 

A treatise on The presentation of comparative 
Comparative anatomy is a task demanding an 
Anatomy. extensive and lucid terminology of 

technical terms, great skill in graphic presentation 
of the complicated structural interrelations of parts, 
and a logical marshalling of the seemingly endless 
array of data so that the reader is conscious of his 
progress through the subject. These requirements 
of a clear-cut terminology, of illustrations which 
really portray relations, and of logical presentation 
characterize Professor J. S. Kingsley's "Compara- 
tive Anatomy of Vertebrates" (Blakiston). The 
illustrations are unusually numerous, clear, and well- 
labelled; they are mainly original, and specially 
devised to illustrate the text. Many stereograms 
are employed, with excellent results, to express in 
contour the relations of organs. A little more ac- 
cent and contrast, bolder utilization of heavy lines, 
and more care in the use of the blender upon shaded 
surfaces would have greatly improved some of these 
otherwise excellent drawings. The author pays 
especial attention to the vertebrate skull, an excel- 
lent motif horn the standpoint either of comparative 
anatomy or of pedagogy. The use of bold-face type 
for technical terms will greatly enhance the value 
of the book as a work of reference, as will also the 
exceptionally complete index and extensive bibli- 
ography. The volume is a welcome and excellent 
addition to the list of American biological text-books 
and works of reference. 



American ^ ne reniar k of M. Carnot, late Pres- 

assodations ident of the French Republic, that 
in Paris. Chaque homme a deux pays, le sein 

et la France," indicates a frame of mind which is 
very general and which has given rise to a multitude 
of books dealing with things French. Some of these 
volumes have been solid contributions to the subject, 
some have been entertaining, some have been both 
solid and entertaining ; but Mr. John Joseph Con- 
way's " Footprints of Famous Americans in Paris " 
(Lane) is, candidly, neither the one nor the other. 
One derives the impression that a host of Americans 
have left traces in Paris, but that they made no foot- 



prints distinct enough to be worth recording in a 
sumptuously bound, printed, and illustrated volume. 
A painstaking search among standard biographies 
and a few somewhat more esoteric sources reveals 
little that is significant or even diverting, Love 
affairs, when Americans were so obliging as to in- 
volve themselves in more or less harmless liaisons, 
are utilized to the full ; so are the bristling idiosyn- 
cracies of Whistler. But. in general, distinguished 
Americans seem to have gone soberly about their 
business in Paris, and there is consequently little 
material for the book. As a result, the author is 
driven to include not only divers Americans who are 
so far from famous that a normally intelligent reader 
has never heard of them, but such " Americans " as 
Tom Paine and La Fayette, who are lugged in willy- 
nilly. Moreover, even when the man under consider- 
ation is undeniably famous and an American, the 
writing is often irrelevant, as when we are told 
that Longfellow died of peritonitis in Craigie House, 
Cambridge. Irrelevancies and small talk abound, 
varied by pages of quotation, or by passages of dull 
record and unsavory anecdote. The book cannot be 
called a contribution to anything ; nor is it interest- 
ing, save in the sense that a vaudeville performance 
is interesting. 

BRIEFER MENTION. 



The attempt to reinstate the lore, or resurrect the 
lure, of an earlier or a foreign mysticism in the language 
or the thought or the environment of a modern time 
and clime is a vain and not wholly innocent pursuit. 
This is particularly the case with such a work as Dr. 
Rudolf Steiner's "The Gates of Knowledge" (Putnam). 
The " gates " seem futile either to exclude or to inclose, 
for the admittance is to a realm of subjective vacuity, 
with stage directions that but emphasize the unreality. 
To what manner of stranded soul or detached spirit 
such immersion in an artificial compound of the volatile 
deposits of occult procedures brings satisfaction or con- 
viction, it is difficult to conjecture. Nevertheless, that 
those who like it take to it is evident to the esoteric as 
well as to the practical mind. 

It is strange that we bave had to wait so long for an 
American edition of Mr. Edward Carpenter's volume of 
poems, "Towards Democracy." This work, first pub- 
lished (in England) in 1883, has long exercised a power- 
ful influence with an ever-widening circle of American 
readers. In form it inevitably suggests Whitman, and 
there is a marked resemblance in spirit also, the 
younger poet has more than a little of the elder's cosmic 
comprehensiveness, his imperturbable faith in nature 
and humanity, his wide unhampered vision. But, as 
Carpenter himself says, " Towards Democracy " shines 
with a milder radiance than " Leaves of Grass," " as of 
the moon compared with the sun." It is more subdued 
and reflective, and associates itself far more intimately 
with the actual social conditions of to-day. The worst 
thing about the book is its title, which has doubtless 
misled and deterred many readers. The American edi- 
tion now published by Mr. Mitchell Kennerley is attract- 
ive in form, though we think many readers will prefer 
the compact little English volume on thin paper. Two 
photogravure portraits of the author are included.

Memoir of Fleeming Jenkin. 

Among the books to he published by Messrs. Harper 
this mouth are the following: "Armaments and Arbit- 
ration," by Rear-Admiral A. T. Mahan; " In the Courts 
of Memory," the Parisian recollections of an American 
woman, Madame L. de Hegermann-Lindenerone ; " Your 
United States," by Mr. Arnold Bennett; and "The 
Ways of the Planets," by Martha Evans Martin. 

Two travel books of especial interest, to appear 
before long, are Captain Roald Amundsen's " The Con- 
quest of the South Pole," and Dr. Sven Hedin's " From 
Pole to Pole." Captain Amundsen gives a full account 
of his successful attempt to reach the South Pole in the 
" Fram," while Dr. Sven Hedin not only deals with his 
own journeys of exploration, but also records those of 
Livingstone, Stanley, and Gordon. 

Bradford Torrey, a popular writer about birds and 
flowers, and the author of many books of nature- 
studies, died October 7 at Santa Barbara, California, 
within two days of his sixty-ninth birthday. He was 
born in 1843 in Weymouth, Massachusetts. Of late 
years, he has been one of the editors of " The Youth's 
Companion." Among his books are " Birds in the

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



Bush," " A Rambler's Lease," " The Foot-path Way," 
"A Florida Sketch-book," "Spring Notes from Ten- 
nessee," " A World of Green Hills," and " Friends on 
the Shelf." 

At the time of his death, Mr. Andrew Lang was pre- 
paring for press a book entitled " Shakespeare, Bacon, 
and the Great Unknown." Mr. Lang having observed 
" with pain, that the controversy has hitherto been pas- 
sionate and acrimonious, endeavours to treat the problem 
with sweet reasonableness, and if possible, with persua- 
sive urbanity." He believes he has been able to demon- 
strate " that neither Bacon nor Bungay, but William 
Shakespeare, of Stratford-on-Avon, was the unassisted 
author of the plays ascribed to him." Messrs. Long- 
mans hope to publish Mr. Lang's book during the com- 
ing month. 

The Reverend Walter William Skeat, the famous 
philologist of Cambridge, died in London on the 
seventh of October. Born in 1835, and educated at 
Cambridge, he occupied a curacy for a time before he 
took up the work of teaching in his alma mater. His 
first work in editing was done for Furnivall's Early 
English Text Society, and was concerned with " Lance- 
lot of the Laik," "Piers Plowman," "The Bruce," 
Chaucer, and the manuscripts of the Anglo-Saxon and 
Northumbrian Gospels. In 1873, he founded the En- 
glish Dialect Society, and became its president. Numer- 
ous publications on the subject of English phonetics and 
philology made him one of the foremost authorities in 
those fields. In his late years, he associated himself 
with the company of those who chase the will-o'-the- 
wisp of spelling reform. 

The other arts have their palaces and their periodicals; 
poetry alone " has been left to shift for herself in a 
world unaware of its immediate and desperate need of 
her." These words of Miss Harriet Monroe's indicate 
the motive which has impelled her to plead Cinderella's 
cause, and act as fairy godmother to the neglected 
child. The coach-and-four provided for her triumphant 
progress takes the form of a little monthly magazine 
entitled " Poetry," the contents being chiefly original 
verse, although space is found for a few pages of appo- 
site prose in the form of editorial comment and critical 
appraisement. The venture is supported by a hundred 
persons who have enough faith in it to pledge subscrip- 
tions of fifty dollars each annually for five years, in con- 
sequence whereof its existence for that period seems 
assured. " We hope," says Miss Monroe, "to offer our 
subscribers a place of refuge, a green isle in the sea, 
where Beauty may plant her gardens, and Truth, austere 
reveal er of joy and sorrow, of hidden delights and des- 
pairs, may follow her brave quest unafraid." Prizes 
are offered for the best poem and the best epigram 
printed during the first year, and an offer has been 
made by an amateur organization to produce the best 
play in verse submitted during that period. The thirty- 
two pages of the first issue give us contributions from 
four living poets, not noticeably better than the verse 
printed in the general magazines of the better sort. The 
issue is given distinction, however, by a long poem, " I 
Am the Woman," printed in advance from the forth- 
coming edition of the works of William Vaughn Moody 
(whose name is here consistently misspelled every time 
it is used). Such a poem as this would justify any 
magazine venture. Although good poetry rarely finds 
any difficulty in getting printed, we will confess to a 
certain satisfaction in the fact that it now has an organ 
of its own.

Completion of a Great 

FIRST FOLIO SHAKESPEARE 

Forty volumes. Edited, with Notes, Introductions, Lists of 
Variorum Readings, and Selected Criticisms, by Charlotte 
Porter and Helen A. Clarke. Photogravure frontispieces 
and rubricated title-pages. Cloth, gilt top, per set $30.00. 
Limp leather, per set, $40.00. Volumes sold separately, 
in cloth at 75 cents and in leather at $1.00 per volume. 

C.The publication this year of seven new volumes in the famous 

u First Folio" Edition of Shakespeare's Works brings to a completion 
this monumental undertaking. The works just pub- 
lished are the three parts of "Henry VI.," "Henry VIII.," 
'Venus and Adonis," "Lucrece," and "Sonnets and 
Minor Poems." C. Shakespeare students and readers 
who have been buying the books as they came out from 
year to year will now be able to complete their sets. 
Those who have put off buying until all the plays 
appeared are advised that the time has arrived for them to 
secure this great work in its entirety. C.The publishers 
size 4y 4 x6y 4 have been gratified at receiving numerous letters of 

commendation concerning the edition, the general tone of which can 

be seen from the few which follow: 

" Delightful, thoroughly useful, and really instructive. I know of no edition that I would rather put 
into the hands of a young student or hold in my own." HENRY VAN DYKE. 

" The best books yet published for the study in college of separate plays." Prof. H. N. MACCRACKEN, 
Yale University. 

" I congratulate you on the form of your issue of the First Folio, and on having taken for it the best 
text of Shakespeare. The Notes and Literary Illustrations, etc., are admirable. Of the many editions I 
have, and have seen, yours will certainly come in the first rank." J. FORBES-ROBERTSON. 

" I find this series beyond question the best for the purpose of my classes." GEORGE B. CHURCHILL, 
Amherst College. 

"Had there been such an edition thirty-five years ago, I should never have undertaken a new variorum. ' ' 
HORACE HOWARD FURNESS. 

"I never fail to find the volumes of this delightful edition illuminating and instructive." EDWARD 
DOWDEN. 

" It will prove, I am sure, the most desirable edition of the Plays which has yet been published. A 
reprint of the First Folio has never been within reach of the general reading public. You will do more for 
Shakespeare by this edition than has been done by any previous one." HIRAM CORSON, Cornell University. 

" Done with unusual intelligence. A great gain for Shakespearean students." HAMILTON W. MABIE. 
" The most useful edition now available for students." BRANDER MATTHEWS.

A MONUMENTAL WORK 

THE MINERAL KINGDOM 

By Dr. REINHARD BRAUNS 

Translated, with Additions, by L. J. SPENCER, M.A., F.G.S. 

T^HE original edition in German has enjoyed a wide circulation amongst Universities, Libraries, Museums, and all 
persons interested in any -way whatever in the study of minerals. It has been translated into Italian, Russian, 
and Bohemian, showing its immense popularity. It is not intended to be a text-book of Mineralogy, being popular 
in its scope and treatment, with such parts of science as are of general interest and usefulness. The first section of 
the book treats of the Ores and their associate minerals, and the Practical Miner and Metallurgist will find together 
all the minerals yielding the metal in which he is especially interested. The second section treats of the precious 
stones and allied minerals. This is of particular value to the Gem Merchant and the Lapidary, as well as the 
Connoisseur. The Archaeologist will also find a description of the minerals which from the earliest times have been 
engraved as gems. The third section treats of the Rock-Forming minerals and the Petrologist and Architect will 
find this portion of the book of immense value to them. The fourth section describes those minerals which are 
necessary to the life and growth of animals and plants, and the Chemical Manufacturer will find this section of 
great value.

THE PERIL OF EXTERNALISM. 

By externalism is meant the control from 
without of any body of people, banded together 
for spiritual or intellectual endeavor, or for the 
realization of any political or social ideal. The 
history of the American people, in its broader 
aspects, is a record of effective protest against 
externalism in religious and civil government. 
It was resentment against externalism that im- 
pelled the puritan colonists of New England to 
depart from the theory of a state-established 
church (in which belief they had been born and 
bred) and create instead the typical American 
system of churches considered as independent 
congregational units, each church a democracy 
governing itself by the common consent of its 
members, making its own rules and choosing its 
own leaders, and not for a moment admitting 
the claims of any external authority. It was 
resentment against externalism in political mat- 
ters that brought about the independence of the 
thirteen commonwealths that in 1776 made com- 
mon cause against the pretensions of a foreign 
legislature respecting taxation, and gained their 
cause by the arbitrament of the sword. It is 
resentment against externalism which is to-day 
actuating those commonwealths, now grown in 
number from thirteen to forty-eight, in resisting 
the efforts of ill-advised doctrinaires to impair 
their several authorities, and magnify at their 
expense the powers of a federal government 
that has already gone dangerously far along 
the perilous path of centralization. 

The specific illustration of the peril of exter- 
nalism to which we would now direct attention is 
that which is offered in the field of higher edu- 
cation in this country. "The Administrative 
Peril in Education " Professor Joseph Jastrow 
calls it in an article which he has contributed 
to the November "Popular Science Monthly." 
It is an old subject, both for him and for us, and 
one which we have both had occasion to discuss 
upon several former occasions. It presents one 
of the most puzzling antinomies in our national 
life, for while we should naturally expect the 
democracy which is the fundamental element 
in our national character to appear in its finest 
flower in our educational institutions, we find 
instead that they tend to embody the autocratic 
idea, and that their systems of administration, 



322 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



instead of encouraging a cordial spirit of coopera- 
tion, tend to become hierarchical, bestowing as 
privileges upon their subordinate individual 
units such limited measure of what should inher- 
ently be their unassailable rights as seems good 
to the men vested with the ultimate authority. 
The reason for these tendencies is perfectly ob- 
vious. The exaggerated commercialism of our 
civilization has achieved such splendid results 
in the economic sphere that it is difficult to per- 
suade our statesmen and our captains of industry 
that their methods have no place in the quite dis- 
parate spheres of education and art and religion. 
It is to their manifest hurt that we liken churches 
and theatres to factories, or libraries, museums, 
and universities to department stores. The dif- 
ference between these activities and those of the 
industrial life is a consequence of the funda- 
mental difference between professions and trades. 
Motives from within are the actuating forces of 
the professional life ; control and direction from 
without are the secret of efficiency in organized 
business. We once put the matter in these 
words, which Professor Jastrow quotes in sup- 
port of his thesis : " The idea of professionalism 
lies at the very core of educational endeavor, 
and whoever engages in educational work fails 
of his purpose in just so far as he fails to assert 
the inherent prerogatives of his calling. He 
becomes a hireling in fact, if not in name, when 
he suffers, unprotesting, the deprivation of all 
initiative, and contentedly plays the part of a 
cog in a mechanism whose motions are all con- 
trolled from without." 

This citation is one of a great number ad- 
duced by our author in behalf of his plea for 
an educational democracy. We quote a few 
of the most striking. " Elsewhere throughout 
the world the university is a republic of scholars, 
administered by them. Here it is a business 
corporation." " The American university has 
become an autocracy, wholly foreign in spirit 
and plan to our political ideals, and little short 
of amazing to those marvels of thoroughgoing 
democracy, the German universities." " The 
administration imposed on universities, colleges, 
and school systems is not needed by them, but 
simply represents an inconsiderate carrying over 
of methods current in commerce and politics." 
" No single thing has done more harm in higher 
education in America during the past quarter- 
century than the steady aggrandizement of the 
presidential office and the modelling of univer- 
sity administration upon the methods and ideals 
of the factory and the department store." " The 
very idea of a university as the home of inde- 



pendent scholars has been obscured by the pres- 
ent system." "The prevailing system does not 
attract strong men to the profession of teaching, 
nor does it foster a vigorous intellectual life in 
the universities. And occasionally a gross and 
tyrannical abuse of authority reminds the world 
how far America is behind Germany in the free- 
dom of its university life." These are typical 
extracts from the testimony of the cloud of 
witnesses who have lately joined in the protest 
against the stifling of the academic spirit be- 
neath the wet blanket of externalism. Professor 
Cattell's recent questionnaire upon the subject 
has shown astonishing results. It was addressed 
to practically all the faculty members of our 
important universities, of whom no less than 
eighty-five per cent registered decided objections 
to the prevailing administrative system. Such 
a protest cannot safely be ignored, and there are 
signs that the authorities are taking heed. 

The most striking illustration of the inability 
of the commercial mind to understand the claims 
and obligations of professionalism is the recent 
suggestion that educational efficiency is measur- 
able in the terms of the factory or the building 
trades. It may be granted that the administra- 
tive efficiency that swells endowments, and en- 
larges plant, and multiplies students is exactly 
measurable, but a true computation of the subtle 
efficiency of the master-mind in its dealings with 
aspiring souls will forever elude exact reckoning. 
On the other hand, as Professor Jastrow remarks, 
"there are efficient fools and knaves and meddlers 
and weather vanes and apologists and dissemblers, 
and most hopelessly the class whose costly effi- 
ciency is an eruption of their callous in sensibility . ; ' 
Of the test of efficiency supplied by figures stand- 
ing for numbers and dollars, these caustic obser- 
vations seem to afford a fair characterization : 

"Prosperity is statistically measured; hence the desire 
for more buildings and costly ones ; for more instructors, 
many of them occupied in work that the college should 
require and not provide; and more and more students 
who must be attracted toward the local Athenopolis and 
away from the rival one; accordingly the hills are all 
reduced to easy grades and new democratic (not royal) 
roads to learning are laid out for those who do not like 
the old ones. Requirements are set not to what collegians 
should learn but to what they will; as at the circus the 
strip of bunting is held ostentatiously high until the horse 
with its fair burden is about to jump, when it is incon- 
spicuously accommodated to the possible performance." 

The consequences of this pandering to our 
pleasure-loving and toil-abhorring youth are 
such as to make possible such a description of 
the student-body as this : 

" Students have no intellectual interests, no applica- 
tions, no knowledge of essentials, no ability to apply 



1912.]

what they assimilate; they are flabby, they dawdle, 
they fritter and frivol, they contemn the grind, they 
seek proficiency in stunts, they drift to the soft and cir- 
cumvent the hard; undertrained and overtaught, they 
are coddled and spoon-fed and served where they should 
be serving; and they get their degrees for a quality of 
work which in an office would cost them their jobs." 
The arraignment is severe, but not undeserved. 
It represents the college idea of preparation for 
life, when the college administration is obsessed 
with the notion that it must prove its efficiency 
by a brave statistical showing. A policy directed 
by educators for the legitimate purposes of edu- 
cation would not bear these pitiful fruits. 

In his summing-up Professor Jastrow points 
his protest against the ideals of externalism, 
which are efficiency of the baser sort and the 
shaping of diverse natures in a common mould, 
by quoting from William James, who once said 
at Harvard that "the university most worthy 
of rational admiration is that one in which your 
lonely thinker can feel himself least lonely, most 
positively furthered, and most richly fed," add- 
ing that " our undisciplinables are our proudest 
product." Whereupon our author goes on to say: 
"The administrative temper breeds an atmosphere 
peculiarly noxious to the finer, freer issues of learning. 
The inner quality so precious to the function of leader- 
ship in intellectual callings, dependent as they are on 
the delicate nurture of the creative gift, is precisely 
that which recedes at the first harsh touch of imposed 
restraint. There is a temperamental disposition in- 
volved, fraught with difficulty of adjustment under the 
most favorable circumstances, beset with hazard through- 
out its uncertain maturing at all levels. Unless the 
academic life is made helpful to its purpose, the course 
of which it must so largely be free to set for itself, 
the ships that bear our most valued cargoes will be 
storm-tossed and needlessly discouraged in their efforts 
to reach their sighted harbors, and some of them will 
mutely and ingloriously go down at sea. It is because 
the present administrative system is so deadly to ' our 
proudest product ' that it appears to me, through the 
vista of a quarter-century, as the supreme peril of the 
educational seas." 



WALT WHITMAN 

We are indebted to Mr. Watts-Dunton for the 
distinction between poets of energy and poets of art. 
The one type attaches primary importance to its 
message, the other to its expression. Perhaps among 
the poets of energy another distinction might be 
made between those whose message is a " criticism " 
of life and those who merely vivify our experience. 
This distinction is apparent in contrasting, for in- 
stance, both verse and prose of Meredith and Scott. 

Walt Whitman obviously belongs with the poets 
of energy. His message overbalances his art so 
much, indeed, that he is hardly thought of as a man 
of letters. He is a prophet ; tbe appreciation of his 
poetry is a " cause " to which converts are eagerly 



sought. He is no doubt receiving a fair hearing. 
His name is already one of distinction ; his audience 
has grown to proportions which make it more than 
a cult ; cosmopolitan critics have admitted his pre- 
cedence. But whether he is to become a recognized 
force in our intellectual and spiritual life we must 
leave to the future to decide. That, however, is the 
final and surest test. "The proof of a poet," he 
says himself, "should be sternly deferred till his 
country absorbs him as affectionately as he has 
absorbed it." 

But no prophet has appeared among us whose 
message is in such need of clarifying. He has been 
enveloped by his disciples in an atmosphere of appre- 
ciative comment which, while making our approach 
to him easy, has stupefied our critical faculties. Those 
who cannot bear the thick incense of the inner shrine 
have come away disgusted, ready to deny the author- 
ity of ehe prophet as well as the vitality of his mes- 
sage. Perspective is sadly needed on both sides. 
But to place Walt Whitman we must have a body 
of doctrine which will relate him to our previous 
spiritual forces ; we must have an analysis of his 
work which will reveal what Whitman has added 
to the sum of human thought or how he has changed 
human aspiration. To sketch the poetical achieve- 
ment of Walt Whitman from this point of view is 
the aim of this essay. 

I. 

Walt Whitman was the avowed poet of a spiritual 
democracy. It was his aim to express in poetry a 
composite individual, a personality inclusive of all 
traits found among men. He would exclude neither 
high nor low, virtuous nor vicious. 

" I am of old and young, of the foolish as much as the wise ; 
Regardless of others, ever regardful of others, 
Maternal as well as paternal, a child as well as a man, 
Stuff'd with the stuff that is coarse, and stuff'd with the 

stuff that is fine." 

It was a daring and original task ; and it is hardly to 
be expected that Walt Whitman more than any other 
brave pioneer should be completely successful. To 
reconcile irreconcilables, to make inconsistencies 
consistent, is the unpromising task which Whitman 
nevertheless did accomplish to a degree ; the ap- 
parent miracle being wrought in the one manner 
possible: by fusing all the elements in the glow of 
emotion. The world is complex to the analysing 
intellect; the uncritical emotions easily simplify and 
unify it. Walt Whitman was therefore a poet pri- 
marily of emotion and energy, that he might unify 
the contradictory elements in the unique personality 
he sought to express. 

In the conception as well as in the execution of 
his task Whitman gave evidence of a high and noble 
seriousness, an assuredness of temper, an intensity 
of creative passion, which prove him a man of very 
high order. He had the poise and balance, the sense 
of contact with primal power, which belong only to 
the masters. Although he professed to be the poet 
of democracy, of the lowly and vulgar as well as of 
the refined, yet one feels the force of a profound cul- 



324 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



ture behind his written work. The naive poetry of 
democracy which Burns left behind him is supported 
by neither such force of intellect nor such depth of 
vision as that of " the good grey poet." 

II. 

But, although a great culture has entered into the 
poetry of Whitman, reason and taste, the faculties 
of culture, must be laid aside by the reader. For 
with this poet emotion is supreme, an emotion which 
is unguided and unrestrained except as it is " a law 
unto itself." Reason and taste are critical and 
directive; they estimate, balance, discard. Culture 
therefore means discrimination and selection; it is 
exclusive. Its ideals tend to become narrow, its 
standards high. In its extreme form it becomes 
pure aestheticism, intellectual or emotional. Obvi- 
ously, only a leisure class can give to the ideal 
of cultivation its highest expression in life; and 
Whitman, with many others, assumes that culture 
is theoretically impracticable in a democracy. In 
America, Whitman believed, we have no place for it. 

" The greatest poems, Shakespeare included, are poison- 
ous to the idea of the pride and dignity of the common 
people, the life-blood of democracy. The models of our 
literature, as we get it from other lands, ultra-marine, have 
had their birth in courts, and bask'd and grown in castle 
sunshine; all smells of princes' favors. Of workers of a 
certain sort, we have, indeed, plenty, contributing after their 
kind ; many elegant, many learn'd, all complacent. But 
touch'd by the national test, or tried by the standards of 
democratic personality, they wither to ashes." 

The American people must be energized by an ideal 
which is democratic both in its appeal and in its pos- 
sibility of expression. Such he believed his vision 
of a religious democracy to be; for it appealed to 
the emotions, and in them is to be found most easily 
our common humanity. 

The exclusion of the directive powers of reason 
and taste, and the freedom given to unguided emo- 
tion, explain the demand made upon us by the dis- 
ciples of Whitman that we accept him whole or not 
at all. " Unless we allow Whitman to be a law unto 
himself," says Mr. Burroughs, "we can make little 
of him; unless we place ourselves at his absolute 
point of view, his work is an offense and without 
meaning." We must not clip his wings. To criti- 
cize, to limit, to weigh, is to exercise reason or taste, 
and hence to assert their ultimate right to supremacy ; 
but this is a fundamental contradiction to the spirit 
of Whitman, and one which if accepted would seem 
almost fatal to his claim to a representative position. 

Whitman's most obvious loss in his rejection of 
culture was a sense of distinction and evaluation. 
His purely emotional appreciation of the panorama 
of life was too immediate an experience to leave 
room for reflection. Detachment appeared cold to 
him. But it is an absolute requisite for preserving 
proportion in literature and life; no true criticism 
is possible without it. And the very subordinate 
position accorded to the spirit of criticism, of evalu- 
ation, in Whitman's poetry accounts for that chaos 
of standards and monotony of tone which is appar- 
ent to even the casual reader. 



Our emotional reaction to the world must, indeed, 
be various both in degree and kind to be satisfying. 
The rose, the clod, the stars, the throbbing city 
street, speak to us in accents by no means similar or 
of equal force. Whitman boasted that he included 
all, as perhaps he did ; but he certainly had not the 
pliability of spirit, he was too great an egoist, to 
interpret all. His point of view was not one that 
tolerates a variety of experience. He did not draw 
near to life in all its phases and attempt to catch 
its spirit. His own personality, his u cosmic" self, 
was too predominating. The procession of animate 
and inanimate creation through his pages have a 
value not in their own right, but derived from the 
poet's transforming vision. And the emotion which 
unifies the strange variety of his poetical work, which 
breathes into it the cogent spirit of personality, has 
been accurately called "cosmic emotion"; it is a 
translation into feeling of intellectual monism. 
Whitman was an emotional mystic, and regarded 
the multiform variety of the world only as an ex- 
pression of its essential unity. 

III. 

But it was with the vision of a spiritual democracy 
that the profound creative energy of Whitman ex- 
ercised itself ; and our judgment of him as a religious 
poet must form the basis of our final estimate. He 
has himself explained the purpose of his poetry in a 
passage of irresistible power in one of his prefaces : 
" I will see (said I to myself) whether there is not, for my 
purposes as a poet, a religion, and a sound religious germen- 
ancy in the average human race, at least in their modern 
development in the United States, and in the hardy common 
fibre and native yearnings and elements, deeper and larger, 
and affording more profitable returns, than all mere sects or 
churches as boundless, joyous, and vital as Nature itself 
a germenancy that has too long been unencouraged, unsung, 
almost unknown." 

Religion is too large and too important a factor to 
be left to an institution. "It must be consigned 
henceforth to democracy en masse, and to literature. 
It must enter into the poems of the nation. It 
must make the nation." 

As thus stated the ideal has self-evident value. 
Has Whitman, however, been successful in the ex- 
ecution of his task? Is the imagined personality of 
" Leaves of Grass " truly religious ? Does that book 
contain in it the enthralling vision which can energize 
the mass of average men? 

" Leaves of Grass " is a monistic chant. It cele- 
brates the universe as a whole, and not any one part 
alone. It expresses not a personal but a " cosmic " 
emotion. Its view is not that of a struggling mem- 
ber, but of an idle spectator of the cosmic process. 
" Apart from the pulling and hauling stands what I am ; 
Stands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle, unitary." 

And because he has made monism the basis of his 
poetry, Whitman is able to be inclusive, to be the 
poet of wickedness as well as of goodness; for him 
there is no wickedness and no goodness, as such, but 
merely a cosmic process. 

This may indeed seem like ultimate spiritual 
democracy. But in reality it is the very opposite ; it 



1912.] 



THE DIAL 



325 



is the expression of a spiritual "special privilege." 
The average man cannot indulge much in k ' cosmic 
emotion"; he is forced to concern himself with his 
immediate interests as a part of the process. His life 
will consequently be justified to him on vastly other 
grounds than those Whitman has suggested. He 
would not be able to understand "Leaves of Grass" 
because it is remote from anything he has ever expe- 
rienced. And so Whitman, although democratic 
with a vengeance in his inclusiveness, can never be 
democratic in his appeal. 

The religion of the average man must obviously 
recognize the dualism which is his daily experience. 
The average man is ever looking forward into an 
uncertain future ; the situation calls for activity and 
self-direction. Life is strenuous if it is at all moral 
or religious, and its struggle develops better than 
anything else the " religious germenancy " which 
Whitman believed was in all men. But Whitman 
was composed, satisfied with himself and the world ; 
the future did not invite him to effort, nor the present 
to discriminate. 
" Showing the best, and dividing it from the worst, age 

vexes age ; 
Knowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of things, 

while they discuss I am silent, and go bathe and 

admire myself.'' 

While Whitman thus seems to occupy a position 
beyond good and evil, he has as a matter of fact yet 
to arrive at that parting of the ways where the moral 
realm begins and ethical distinctions have sway. 
He was a spectator of the panorama of life, not an 
actor in its drama. Even in his profoundly religious 
spirit there is a pervading Bohemianism which viti- 
ates his work. In no place is this more evident than 
in his attitude towards woman. Whitman never 
understood the distinctively feminine, in which the 
ethical appears upon this planet in its fairest and 
finest form. His love poetry is primal and instinctive, 
with an occasional approach to Oriental voluptuous- 
ness and brutality. " Cosmic " emotion does not, 
indeed, blend well with love, the subtlest, most 
delicate, and most personal of human feelings. 

In his intense belief in the goodness of the uni- 
verse, Whitman was thus too ready to compromise 
with the spirits of darkness. We may have to admit 
that, in the final scheme of things, evil will appear 
to have been as necessary as the good ; but we can- 
not afford now to accept evil as readily as the good. 
The modern man believes, too, in the autonomy of 
the spiritual nature of humanity. But he need not 
and cannot leave this nature unnurtured or the vic- 
tim of aimless drift. Monistic optimism is therefore 
to him an impossible faith ; in its stead experience 
sternly thrusts upon him a dualism, and dualism 
means guidance by norms. Reason and taste must in- 
evitably function to systematize experience,determine 
standards, and act as a corrective and directive force 
in the relations of man to the world about him. 

IV- 

Thus we are brought back again from the weird- 
ness of "Leaves of Grass" to life in its familiar 



aspect, with all the old pressing problems still un- 
solved. But every reader of Whitman must recognize 
that something has been gained, even though it be 
not the expected solution to the persistent riddle. 
What is the secret of Whitman's power? To what 
can we attribute the exhilarating and strengthening 
qualities of his poetry? 

The famous confession of John Addington 
Symonds is illustrative, although a little extreme to 
be typical, of the experience of men of culture in 
contact with Whitman : 

" ' Leaves of Grass,' which I first read at the age of 
twenty-five, influenced me more perhaps than any other 
book has done, except the Bible ; more than Plato, more 
than Goethe. . . . My academical prejudices, the literary 
instincts trained by two decades of Greek and Latin studies, 
the refinements ef culture, and the exclusiveness of aristo- 
cratic breeding, revolted against the uncouthness, roughness, 
irregularity, coarseness of the poet and his style. But, in 
course of a short time, Whitman delivered my soul of these 
debilities." 

Symonds did not, however, as everyone knows, give 
up his academic interests when on the threshold of 
manhood, to become a "natural and non-chalant" 
loafer. His whole life was devoted to such matters 
as appeal only to the cultivated. Whitman did not 
replace his culture, but broadened it. 

This is the distinctive service which the poetry 
of Whitman is able to render us. It is a liberator 
from academic narrowness, enlarging as it does the 
basis of culture. The subtle and intricate thought 
and feeling of the highly developed man, he does 
not express ; his spirit reached back into a primeval, 
chaotic state, where the elemental was the most ob- 
vious. His universe is in need of evolution. This 
partly explains its fascination for us; in the midst of 
the complexities of civilization we hear and respond 
to the call of the wild. Perhaps at times our habit- 
ual refinement would like to exclude some of the 
rawness we find there; but, when the shock is once 
overcome, the experience becomes satisfying, our 
outlook and sympathies are broadened, our culture 
itself becomes intenser and deeper because it draws 
power from the uncultivated, the primitive, the 
elemental. 

In the poetry of Whitman, then, we do not find 
a trustworthy constructive criticism of life, but 
rather the chaotic, unevolved elements of life itself. 
His poetry serves not as a guide, but as a point of 
departure. His creative energy aimed, not at culti- 
vation, but at expansion. Louis I. BBEDVOLD. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



PROS AND CONS on any question of wide interest 
are usually so many, and each, taken alone, so con- 
vincing, that it is not surprising if there rises to the 
lips the old cry, What is truth ? A person of judicial 
habit of mind, and not a violent partisan by tempera- 
ment, is torn by this conflict of arguments. In child- 
hood all things are either black or white ; there are 
no grays. All men are good or bad, all actions either

right or wrong, and the line of division is as sharp 
as that separating the mathematician's plus and 
minus quantities. But the years that bring the 
philosophic mind take away this comfortable cer- 
tainty and leave us floundering in a sea of doubts. 
In illustration of the inevitable two-sidedness (and 
sometimes many-sidedness) of every question, the 
double-column pages of an excellent and useful pub- 
lication (" Pros and Cons," by Mr. John Bertram 
Askew) set forth with clearness and sufficient brevity 
the arguments for and against a great number of 
proposed reforms and legislative acts. The book is 
by this time no novelty to the reading world, being 
now in its fifth edition (re- written and enlarged) and 
the sixteenth year of its life. But as it is an English 
work it may not be very familiar to American 
readers. As an example of the impartial author's 
manner of setting up a thesis with one hand and 
knocking it down with the other, let us quote from 
the section headed " A Censorship of Fiction." It 
begins, in the left-hand column : " The evil of per- 
nicious literature is a grave and dangerous one, and 
deeply affects the principles and lives of the young 
people of the nation. The steady increase in crime 
may be to a considerable degree laid at the door of 
fiction." This is rebutted in the parallel column, 
thus : " The responsibility of fiction for the increase 
in crime is greatly exaggerated. The ' young person ' 
who will be led astray by fiction is so weak that he 
will go wrong, fiction or no fiction. Fiction repro- 
duces the spirit of the age rather than creates it." 
And so the argumentative see-saw goes agreeably on 
through one subject after another. It is a contro- 
versial teeter- board of infinite diversion and also 

of much sound sense. 



A NOTABLE ADDITION TO AMERICAN PAGEANTRY 

was the festival procession which formed the great 
outdoor spectacle on the occasion of last month's 
celebration of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the 
founding of Mount Holyoke College. In a setting of 
wonderful autumn splendor, by means of pantomime 
and symbolic tableaux, the academic departments of 
the college depicted the liberal arts and sciences, 
while alumnae, in the fashions of three-quarters of 
a century, presented the seventy-five years of the 
life of Mount Holyoke. From the first gay fiddling 
of mediaeval minstrels, as, crossing a rustic bridge 
and winding through brilliant trees, they led the 
head of the great procession out on the grassy stage 
under the eyes of more than three thousand specta- 
tors, to the last rushing together of all the companies 
of heralds and color-bearers on the wide green of 
the South Campus, scene after scene unfolded in 
significant and arresting beauty. Augustus and 
Agrippa celebrated the Ludi Saeculares in the year 
17 B.C. The chemical element paced through its 
chequered history, ending in an ingenious setting 
forth of Mendele'eff's "Periodic Law." Geology, 
botany, and zoology united to depict evolution in 
nature, even to Mendel's law of heredity. Portrait 
figures presented masterpieces of the world's art. 



In the presence of Louis XIV., Moliere conducted 
rehearsals of his plays. Economics unfolded in five 
groups the evolution of industrial society. Twenty 
departments, with an ingenuity and comprehensive- 
ness which can only be hinted at, thus developed 
each a single subject chosen from its own special 
field of knowledge. This is something new in page- 
antry. By its originality of conception, spontaneity 
of execution, variety and freedom of design, its beauty 
of color, and continuity of thought, Mount Holyoke's 
"Festival Procession" made that provocative appeal 
to the imagination which is the final test of all art. 
That this expression of the life of an academic com- 
munity was entirely the product of that community 
itself is still more suggestive. The seven hundred 
undergraduates who participated received no "pro- 
fessional" training. The historic accuracy of their 
costuming derived from no imported brains. To- 
Professor Jewett, creator of the pageant, and her 
able assistants is due this fresh insight into the art 
impulses of twentieth-century life. 



A DECADE OF LIBRARY GROWTH forms the subject 
of Mr. John Cotton Dana's current report to the 
people of Newark (N. J.) concerning his adminis- 
tration of their great and rapidly growing public 
library. The decade began with the removal from 
old to new quarters, from the outgrown building in 
West Park Street to the splendid new structure 
which, including land, cost not far from half a mil- 
lion dollars and is one of our notable examples of 
library architecture. Also coincident, or nearly 
coincident with the beginning of the decade, if we 
mistake not, was Mr. Dana's assumption of his pres- 
ent position ; and in that time he has had the grati- 
fication of seeing the institution under his direction 
grow marvellously in all its departments. From 
approximately seventy-eight thousand volumes ten 
years ago, the book-collection has increased to nearly 
two hundred thousand; the annual circulation has 
grown from less than a third of a million to more 
than a million volumes; six branch libraries have 
been established, and the eight delivery stations of 
ten years ago have become magnified and trans- 
formed into thirteen deposit stations ; and the library 
staff has undergone enlargement, from sixteen per- 
sons to forty-four, not including messengers, janitors, 
elevator men, engineers, and firemen. But all these 
figures are, of course, merely the crude symbols of 
that growth and ramification in the library's educa- 
tional activities, that increased power of ministering 
to the deeper needs of its patrons, which have come 
as the result of ten years' well-directed effort. 



A POSSIBLE UNEARTHING OF LITERARY TREASURE 

possessing value beyond the dreams of bibliophilism 
may be regarded as a not very remote contingency. 
If the present disturbances in the Balkan peninsula 
should prove to mean that Turkey's hour of doom 
has struck, there would be reasonable hope that the 
thousands of precious manuscripts known to be stored 
in the vaults of St. Sophia might at last see the light.

Tradition avers that at the time of the Turkish con- 
quest of Constantinople more than a million manu- 
scripts were hastily consigned for safe keeping to 
the crypts heneath the sacred edifice; and though 
Ottoman arrogance, which forbids Christians to visit 
what was once the chief shrine of their faith, has 
stubbornly refused to let these literary relics be ex- 
amined, a very few favored persons have been allowed 
to get a tantalizing peep at the piles of dusty rolls 
mouldering in subterranean darkness. One of these 
grudgingly-privileged ones was the late Moberly 
Bell, of the London "Times," who left a description 
of what was revealed to his hurried glance. In its 
pre-Mohammedan prime the Byzantine capital num- 
bered a million and more inhabitants, and boasted 
many fine churches, famous monasteries, and flour- 
ishing schools, while its leading citizens had each 
his private library of considerable value. Conse- 
quently the possibilities awaiting realization when 
the accumulated treasures of St. Sophia's crypts 
shall be unlocked are such as no scholar can con- 
template in imagination with unquickened pulse. 
Who knows but, among other priceless legacies of 
classical antiquity, there may be discovered the lost 
books of Livy, and the missing tragedies of ^schy- 
lus and Sophocles, and the poems of Anacreon and 
Alcaeus and Sappho? 

WHY NOVELS MULTIPLY, especially in the English 
book- world, is explained by London publishers or 
at least an explanation is attempted somewhat as 
follows. A great many women have in recent years 
entered the ranks of journalism, but have found 
themselves somewhat handicapped for that strenuous 
calling by " sex disability." Therefore, unwilling to 
abandon the pen for the needle or the egg-beater, 
or other implement of female industry, they have 
turned to the writing of romances for the entertain- 
ment of other women, and some men, and have found 
on the whole a hospitable market for their wares. 
Indeed the publishers (Messrs. William Heinemann 
and Arthur Waugh are quoted on this head) are said 
to show a certain partiality for women's work in this 
field of literature. The manuscripts submitted by 
women novelists far outnumber those offered by men, 
and commonly prove fully as acceptable, though in 
point of literary finish, attention to the rules of 
sentence-construction, and so on, the average edu- 
cated woman shows herself inferior to the average 
educated man. Apropos of this, one might observe, 
parenthetically, it is curious to note the carelessness 
in such subordinate details of even so gifted and 
scholarly a woman novelist as Mrs. Humphry Ward. 
Her paragraphing and punctuation, for example, seem 
at times to be dictated by pure caprice. In further 
evidence of the inherent attractions of novel-writing 
for our " sex-disabled " women journalists, attention 
is called to the smallness of remuneration that awaits 
their labors. The pecuniary return for a work of 
fiction does not average more than two hundred dol- 
lars, while the labor of writing may have extended 
over six months or a year, with no certainty of accept- 



ance even at the end of that time. Froude's remark 
is an often-quoted one, that the literary calling is 
" the only occupation in which wages are not given 
in proportion to the goodness of the work done." 

"LAMBING WITH MR. LUCAS" is an admirable 
and easily understood phrase attributed by Mr. 
Henry C. Shelley to an American friend of his who, 
in the course of a visit to England, assured Mr. 
Shelley that her dearest desire was to go Lambing 
through London with Mr. E. V. Lucas. No better 
guide to Lamb's London could be found than Elia's 
genial biographer, who doubtless could dilate on the 
charms of the metropolis with something of the same 
eloquence as did Lamb himself in that letter to his 
friend Manning wherein he glows with enthusiasm 
over the " shops sparkling with pretty faces of indus- 
trious milliners, neat sempstresses, ladies cheapen- 
ing, gentlemen behind counters lying, authors in the 
street with spectacles, George Dyers (you may know 
them by their gait), lamps lit at night, pastry-cooks' 
and silver-smiths' shops, beautiful Quakers of Pen- 
tonville, noise of coaches, drowsy cry of mechanic 
watchmen at night, with bucks reeling home drunk ; 
if you happen to wake at midnight, cries of Fire 
and Stop thief; inns of court, with their learned airs, 
and halls, and butteries, just like Cambridge colleges ; 
old book-stalls, Jeremy Taylors, Burtons on Melan- 
choly, and Religio Medicis on every stall. These 
are thy pleasures, London with-the-many-sins." 
In a sense, we can all, fortunately, go Lambing 
through London with Mr. Lucas : we can do it in his 
books ; and we can also go Lucasing through London, 
not only in some of his earlier volumes, but also, and 
most enjoyably, in his new novel, "London Laven- 
der," which will be found none the worse for the 
occasional reappearance of some of the familiar 
characters from its predecessors. 

THE POST OF BIOGRAPHER TO ERRATIC GENIUS 

is not the easiest in the world to fill, as must be 
evident to every reader of Mr. Albert Bigelow 
Paine's account (in the November "Harper") of 
some of his experiences in trying to gather from 
Mark Twain's flow of varied and extremely enter- 
taining personal reminiscence such trustworthy data 
as were needed for his prospective work. Unfor- 
tunately for the biographer, Mark Twain's imagina- 
tion eclipsed his memory in so many instances that 
his autobiographic outpourings had to be carefully 
checked and corrected with the help of such other 
sources of information as were available if there 
were any such, as doubtless was not always the case. 
" If you wanted to know the worst of Mark Twain," 
says his biographer, " you had only to ask him for it. 
He would give it, to the last syllable worse than 
the worst, for his imagination would magnify it and 
adorn it with new iniquities, and if he gave it again, 
or a dozen times, he would improve upon it each 
time, until the thread of history was almost impos- 
sible to trace through the marvel of that fabric ; and 
he would do the same for another person just a&

willingly." Painfully conscientious and unsparing 
as Mark Twain is well-known to have been in his 
self-revelations, he simply could not cure himself of 
his growing habit of remembering quantities of 
things that never happened. " When I was 
younger," he once quaintly remarked, " I could 
remember anything, whether it happened or not ; 
but I am getting old, and soon I shall remember 
only the latter." ... 

ACKNOWLEDGING THE UNPROCLAIMED ACHIEVE- 
MENT, welcoming the literary angel that comes to 
us unawares, is a task of peculiar pleasure which 
presents itself all too infrequently. Such a pleasure, 
however, we now indulge ourselves in by advising 
the discriminating to possess themselves at once of a 
little volume called " The Children of Light," which 
has just come unheralded from the press. It is the 
work of Miss Florence Converse, whose " Long Will " 
was recently accorded the honor of inclusion in 
"Everyman's Library." But unlike that romance, 
"The Children of Light" is a tale of to-day of the 
mighty movement for social regeneration which is 
slowly spreading over the world. It is a narrative 
of much interest, told with rare distinction of style : 
but its chief charm resides in the fine breath of 
idealism which animates the whole. Something is 
here of the spiritual glow and fervor of Ruskin and 
Morris the Ruskin of " Fors," the Morris of " News 
from Nowhere." Especially to generous-hearted 
young people, eager to bear their part in the strug- 
gle for social righteousness yet bewildered by the 
complexities of the problem, will this book bring joy 
and enlightenment. If a few such readers find their 
way to the volume through this brief paragraph, its 

purpose will have been fulfilled.

POETRY BY LINEAR MEASUREMENT appears to 
form one of the subjects of study to be pursued at a 
certain leading school of journalism. A press notice 
announces that this school "will offer this year a 
number of new courses in magazine writing and 
editing, magazine advertising and circulation, and 
magazine and newspaper verse." Wherein magazine 
and newspaper verse differs conspicuously from 
other verse seems to be the neat space-filling quality 
that commands the reader's admiration as he reaches 
the end of a prose article not quite able to stretch 
itself to the bottom of the page or column. Here 
the couplet, the quatrain, or in rare instances the 
poem of six or eight lines, is in requisition ; and the 
practical journalist who can assist at the make-up 
of the pages and fill in the gaps with appropriate 
verse, should command a good weekly wage. 



THE FIRST PROFESSORSHIP OF PRINTS known to 
exist in the educational or art world will be estab- 
lished at Harvard as soon as an endowment of one 
hundred and fifty thousand dollars is assured, two- 
thirds of it being already pledged by seven New 
York and Boston art-lovers. The occupant of the 
new chair will also act as curator of prints at the 
Boston Museum of Fine Arts ; and the person already 



selected for this double office is said to be Mr. Fitz- 
Roy Carrington, who for the past fifteen years has 
been a partner in the well-known New York art 
firm of Frederick Keppel & Co., and is reputed one 
of the foremost print-connoisseurs in the country. 
In this connection it is also announced that "The 
Print-Collector's Quarterly," the only American 
periodical devoted wholly to engravings and etch- 
ings, will be taken over by the Museum. Mr. 
Carrington has been editor of the " Quarterly " from 
its beginning nearly two years ago. A considerable 
enlargement of the present collections of prints in 
the Boston Art Museum and in the Fogg Museum at 
Cambridge, and the organizing of a national society 
of print-lovers, are among the things Mr. Carrington 
hopes to accomplish. . . . 

THE INTELLECTUAL LIFE, long before and ever 
since Hamerton wrote so convincingly about it, has 
been to thousands the only life worth living. This 
conviction is voiced again by the new president of 
Amherst in his inaugural address. Dr. Meiklejohn 
began his talk to the assembled college thus : " What- 
ever others may say, the teacher knows that the 
primary business of the college is intellectual rather 
than technical or professional. The college is pri- 
marily not a place of the body, nor of the feelings, 
nor of the will. First of all, it is a place of the 
mind. And the justification of intellectual training 
is, first, that thinking is one of the most wholesome, 
most captivating, most satisfying of human pursuits. 
And second, more important still, that thinking is 
good because of its contribution to life. Our funda- 
mental educational principle is that if a human life 
has been translated from forms of feeling to those of 
ideas, life has become more successful." It is safe 
to predict that the importance which at Amherst 
has ever been attached to the things of the mind 
will suffer no diminution at President Meiklejohn's 
hands. . . . 

MRS. HOWE'S MEMORIALTPORTRAIT, the gift of 
those many admirers of hers who have delighted to 
contribute toward this testimonial which is now 
formally presented to the Bostonian Society, was 
unveiled the other day in the council chamber of 
the Old State House, no room for it having been 
found in Faneuil Hall or the Old South Meeting 
House where attempts were made to have it hung. 
Mrs. Howe's son-in-law, Mr. John Elliott, was the 
artist naturally and fittingly chosen to paint the 
portrait, and he is thought to have achieved a re- 
markable likeness. Mr. Edwin D. Mead, one of 
the speakers of the occasion, expressed his satisfac- 
tion at seeing the portrait hung in the historic old 
building, and added: "One would have to weld 
together two women of the colonial period to match 
Mrs. Howe, and those two women would be Anne 
Hutchinson and Anne Bradstreet." Of Dr. and 
Mrs. Howe's old friends, it was pleasing to note the 
attendance of Mr. Frank B. Sanborn, who made a 
short address. Of course the "Battle Hymn" was 
sung, to make the occasion complete.

THE HOUSE OF BRONTE. 

A veritable House of Usher that lonely par- 
sonage at Haworth must have been, at least it 
so stands forth in one's mental picture of it 
blank, bare, bleak, and ominous, at the very 
end of the steep and narrow street that climbs 
between its double row of gray stone houses to 
the apex of the hill. The ancient gray stone 
church with its square and solid tower stands 
opposite, and from the gray front of the little 
house its five upper windows stare down upon 
the mouldering tombstones of the parish grave- 
yard an accompaniment as symbolic as that 
of the dark and stagnant tarn. This picture 
of the house is insistently suggested when one 
recalls the history of the Brontes. It has evi- 
dently impressed Miss Sinclair, the author of 
this latest study of the three remarkable sisters 
whose literary achievement has brought such 
fame to this strange family. Miss Sinclair 
says : 

" It is the genius of the Brontes that made their place 
immortal; but it is the soul of the place that made their 
genius what it is. You cannot exaggerate its import- 
ance. They drank and were saturated with Haworth. 
. . . Haworth is saturated with them. Their souls are 
henceforth no more to be disentangled from its soul than 
their bodies from its earth." 

The pathetic drama of Patrick Bronte's house- 
hold loses none of its significance in Miss Sin- 
clair's narrative. The shadow of death hovers 
over the family from the beginning to the end. 
Eighteen months after their advent at Haworth 
the mother was buried in the vault of the gray 
stone church, and on the flat stone above her 
grave was carved the text "Be ye also ready." 
The five little Bronte girls were sent away to a 
school, the Clergy Daughter's School, which 
happened to be situated "in an unwholesome 
valley." Then Marie, aged twelve, was brought 
home to die ; Elizabeth, aged eleven, followed 
her sister. Charlotte, Emily, and Anne were 
now at Haworth again, and there they lived 
undisturbed by further tragedy for seven years. 
Their activities were in part domestic, but by no 
means limited by the gray walls of the parsonage, 
the old stone church, or the sombre cemetery. 
The freedom of the moors was theirs, the dun 
and purple moors surrounded, as Mrs. Gaskell 
describes them, by the sinuous, wave-like hills 
grand from the ideas of solitude and loneliness 
that they suggest. And now they entered another

world, the one created by their own imagination, 
which gave the childhood of these three sisters 
and their brother, Branwell, a coloring as unique 
as it was intense. It is not uncommon for chil- 
dren to live in a playland of strange fancies, but 
here was something different from the experience 
of normal childhood. " For a considerable num- 
ber of years they were the ' Islanders.' " *' It 
was in 1827 [Charlotte, at thirteen, records the 
date] that our plays were established : Young 
Men, June, 1826 ; Our Fellows, July, 1827 ; 
The Islanders, December, 1827. These are our 
three great plays that are not kept secret." 
And then there were the secret plays, Emily's 
and Charlotte's, " shy and solitary flights of 
Emily's and Charlotte's genius," Miss Sinclair 
terms them. They had begun to write. " They 
seem to have required absolutely no impulsion 
from without," she says. " The difficult thing 
for these small children was to stop writing." 
And from this singular school of authorship 
came in due time that astonishing group of 
novels which has served for wonderment and 
comment ever since. 

As was to have been expected, Miss Sinclair's 
study of the Brontes is vivacious, dramatic, 
frank, and unconventional. She apologizes for 
her book on the ground that too much has been 
said already about Charlotte and her family, 
so much, indeed, that the truth itself is buried 
under a confused tangle of distorted facts. She 
does not spare the biographers. Mrs. Gaskell 
is censured for injustice to Patrick Bronte, the 
eccentric head of the house, whom Miss Sinclair 
describes as " a poor, unhappy and innocent 
old man." George Henry Lewes is " gross and 
flippant "; and as for Mrs. Oliphant, " there is 
nothing from her fame downward" that she did 
not grudge Charlotte. 

In 1846 appeared the volume of "Poems by 
Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell"; in 1847 the 
novel, "Agnes Grey," by Anne, "Jane Eyre," 
by Charlotte, and "Wuthering Heights," by 
Emily. In the next year came Branwell's tragic 
end, in September; in December Emily died, 
aged twenty-nine; and five months later Anne 
too, at twenty-seven, succumbed to the same dis- 
ease (tuberculosis) which had claimed her sister. 
In September of that year, 1849, Charlotte com- 
pleted " Shirley." She did not lack apprecia- 
tion; Mrs. Gaskell, Harriet Martineau, and 
Thackeray were her admiring friends, but her 
celebrity did not destroy her shyness or wean 
her from her attachment to Haworth. " Villette " 
was published in 1853, and in that year Char- 
lotte was married to Arthur Nicholls, her father's

curate. "The Professor" was not published 
until 1857. In March, 1855, Charlotte Bronte 
died then in her thirty-ninth year. Her 
mother's death had occurred at the same age, 
and Branwell, too, had died at thirty-nine. 

Miss Sinclair's book will interest all who are 
interested in the Brontes ; it is a study that has 
unusual value. The passion, the spirit of revolt, 
the elemental in the work of Charlotte and 
Emily, are here given sympathetic emphasis. 
To Emily the biographer gives a leading place ; 
"Wuthering Heights" is in her estimation 
superior to "Jane Eyre," and Emily's poems 
receive highest praise. It is the figure of Emily 
Bronte, tall, strong, and unconquerable, solitary 
and unique, that dominates Miss Sinclair's im- 
agination at the conclusion of the story she has 
so vividly retold. But once again, in her con- 
cluding chapter, she harks back to that gray 
stone house on the hill as she found it, when 
a child, in the vivid pages of Mrs. Gaskell's 
wonderful life: 

" I knew every corner of that house. I have an im- 
pression (it is probably a wrong one) of a flagged path 
going right down from the Parsonage door through 
another door and plunging among the tombs. I saw six 
little white and wistful faces looking out of an upper 
window; I saw six little children going up and up a lane, 
and I wondered how the tiny feet of babies ever got so 
far. I saw six little Bronte babies lost in the spaces of 
the illimitable moors. They went over rough stones 
and walls and mountain torrents; their absurd petticoats 
were blown upwards by the wind, and their feet were 
tangled in the heather. They struggled and struggled, 
and yet were in an ecstacy that I could well understand. 
. . . And, all through, an invisible, intangible presence, 
something mysterious, but omnipotently alive; some- 
thing that excited these three sisters; something that 
atoned, that not only consoled for suffering and solitude 
and bereavement, but that drew its strength from these 
things; something that moved in this book like the soul 
of it; something that they called 'genius.'" 

There is no question of the genius of Char- 
lotte and Emily Bronte. But genius commonly 
arrives by the broad highway of worldly knowl- 
edge; so still the wonder grows how the tiny 
feet of babies ever got so far.

EXPLORATIONS IN THE VASTY DEEP.* 

The great incentives toward exploration 
which have spurred adventurous spirits in the 
past to hazardous endeavor are rapidly disap- 
pearing. Flags fly at both the poles. The inte- 
riors of the continents have been charted, the 
culture of even the remotest tribes of men 
has been described and their folk-lore recorded, 
and the big game of the jungles and plains is 
fast disappearing forever. The explorer of ,the 
future must turn to ultra-mundane spheres for 
novelty, or perchance must seek laboriously to 
unravel the secrets beneath the surface of our 
own little planet. 

Much remains to be done in the mapping of 
the ocean floor ; in determining temperatures, 
salinities, and currents in the sea ; in detecting 
the fate of the immense quantities of nitrogenous 
matter washed from the continents yearly into 
the sea ; in analysing the slowly accumulated 
deposits which make up the soft ooze of the 
ocean bottom ; and, above all, in determining the 
kind, extent, distribution, and natural history 
(or oecology, to use a more modern term) of the 
plant and animal life of the sea, and enabling 
man fully and safely to reap the harvests of the 
sea. Here is work which demands not only 
the knowledge and training of the scientific 
specialist as well as the perseverance and self- 
abnegation of the saint, but also all those 
qualities of hardihood, enthusiasm, daring, im- 
agination, and ingenuity which the successful 
explorer of unknown polar or tropical regions 
must possess. 

It is not without significance that the three 
authors of the works here reviewed and all of 
their collaborators live on the borders of the 
storm-tossed but fertile North Sea, and that a 
Scotchman, a Norwegian, and an Englishman 
should write of the sea and its problems. Indeed,

is the direct result of an international coopera- 
tive scientific enterprise on the part of all the

nations of Northern Europe (except France) 
looking towards an adequate scientific analysis 
of the results of modern fishing by machinery 
and endeavoring adequately to determine the 
productivity of the sea and to measure the fac- 
tors which condition it. 

The Norwegian section of the " International 
Commission for the Investigation of the Sea" 
had for its leader Dr. Johan Hjort, and its ten 
years of explorations in northern waters were 
carried on in the "Michael Sars," a staunch 
little steamer built on the main lines of a com- 
mercial trawler and named for one of Norway's 
illustrious zoologists. Sir John Murray, joint 
author of "The Depths of the Ocean" and the 
patron of the expedition, was a member of the 
scientific staff of the famous Challenger Expedi- 
tion of 1872-1876 and later the director of the 
researches carried on upon its collections. He 
was also editor of the fifty quarto volumes of 
"Reports" and author of the "Summary of 
Results" of this expedition, forming the most 
adequate account of the life of the sea as yet 
published. Such leadership at once made the 
cruise of the "Michael Sars" in the summer of 
1910, in the tropical and northern Atlantic, 
noteworthy in the annals of marine exploration. 
It made possible an attack upon the problems 
of the sea with the most modern fully-tested 
equipment, elaborated by the International 
Commission, in experienced hands and under 
expert guidance of the highest order. Brief 
though this expedition was, its results are of 
far more significance than those of any other 
since that of the Challenger. 

Some of the discoveries recorded are the detec- 
tion of tidal currents in the deep sea far from 
land, running a clock-wise course throughout 
the day ; the accurate measurement and analysis, 
by means of the centrifuge, of the very minute 
life in ocean waters which has usually escaped 
detection even with the finest silk nets ; the de- 
termination by photographic plates of the depth 
to which light of different parts of the spectrum 
penetrates the ocean waters, and a new concep- 
tion of this "light floor" of the sea and its 
relation to the coloration, distribution, and move- 
ments of the denizens of the deep. The collec- 
tions brought up by the vastly more efficient 
types of collecting apparatus used by the 
"Michael Sars" afforded not only many inter- 
esting and bizarre types of fishes and other 
animals new to science, but also more accurate 
determinations of the vertical distribution and 
relative abundance of the various elements in 
the population of the open sea. 



Throughout the work there is constant corre- 
lation of the results with the discoveries of earlier 
workers in the same field, and many suggestions 
as to the problems requiring further work for 
their solution. The book is written for the intel- 
ligent reader, and is an authoritative epitome 
of our present knowledge of the sea, its physical 
constants, environmental features, of the struc- 
ture and composition of the ocean floor, and of 
the varied life of the sea and the factors which 
condition its occurrence and distribution. Not- 
withstanding its composite authorship, the work 
is uniformly well written, and is never lacking 
in interest. It is superbly illustrated with many 
original drawings and colored plates, as well as 
with maps revised in accordance with the latest 
data. 

The Challenger Society for the Promotion 
of the Study of Oceanography has prepared, 
under the able editorship of its secretary, Dr. 
G. Herbert Fowler, a useful work on " The 
Science of the Sea," intended to serve as a hand- 
book of practical oceanography for both profes- 
sional and amateur scientists interested in the 
ocean. It is a scientific treatise, compiled by 
eminent authorities, on the various phases of the 
exploration of the marine world. It is authori- 
tative, up to date, and comprehensive in its scope. 
Technicalities are so reduced or eliminated that 
one need not be a specialist in order to use the 
work intelligently. The questions that arise 
whenever a scientific cruise of even slight pro- 
portions is undertaken are numerous and per- 
plexing. The results of practical experience in 
matters of outfit, equipment, collecting methods 
for plants and animals, instruments for oceano- 
graphic work with soundings, salinities, temper- 
atures, and currents, are here assembled in 
convenient form for reference. The exploration 
of the air, water, shore, sea bottom, the plants 
and animals of the sea, details of yacht equip- 
ment, etc., are dealt with, and there are useful 
directions for dredging and trawling, for fishing 
at sea, and for the preservation of marine organ- 
isms. A chapter on whales and seals discusses 
also the scientific bases for the reported existence 
of sea serpents. Valuable suggestions for record- 
ing scientific data are added by the editor. 
The pages include conversion tables of nautical 
measurements in English and metric units, a 
classified list of manufacturers and dealers sup- 
plying equipment for marine expeditions, a list 
of important books on the subject, and a list of 
the marine biological stations of the world. The 
volume will not only be of great assistance to all 
scientists concerned in those fields which have to

science in this direction are often excellent, and 
whose aid is so often gladly given when adequate 
direction is available.

THE 3STEW GRAXT WHITE 
SHAKESPEARE.* 



Were it only as a tribute to American schol- 
arship, this new edition of Shakespeare should 
be welcome. Though Verplanck and Hudson 
may not be forgotten, Richard Grant White 
was as surely the first notable American Shake- 
spearean editor as Dr. Furness, lately passed 
away, was the second. White was many things 
besides dramatic and musical critic, journal- 
ist, linguist, and novelist; but it is mainly his 
work in the Shakespearean field that has kept 
his name alive. We are carried back more 
than fifty years to a time when scholarship and 
literature, and literature and journalism, were 
not yet divorced in our land, when professors 
wrote poetry unashamed, and newspaper corre- 
spondents might quote Virgil with full editorial 
approval. White was a product of those condi- 
tions, neither debarred by his inbred culture from 
an influential active career nor yet estranged by 
the distractions of such a career from scholarly 
pursuits. His edition of Shakespeare was pre- 
pared during the most tumultuous years of our 
history, when White himself was doing much by 
his "Yankee Letters!' to the London "Specta- 
tor" to set the cause of the North in a clearer 
light before the British public. 

White's critical interest in Shakespeare was 
aroused by the publication of Collier's notorious 
"discoveries" of marginal corrections in an old 
Folio copy, the claim of which to any special 
deference he vigorously denied, publishing his 
arguments at considerable length. He then set 
about editing Shakespeare himself, completing 
the work in twelve volumes. We are informed 
by Jaggard's " Shakespeare Bibliography " that 
the undertaking was financed by T. P. Barton, 
founder of the Boston Shakespeare Library. 
Lowell, then editor of the newly-launched "At- 
lantic Monthly," reviewed the early volumes in 
1859, and deliberately pronounced the edition

volumes. Illustrated. Boston : Little, Brown, & Co. 



"the best hitherto published." This was in the 
generation of Knight, Collier, Dyce, and Staun- 
ton, all of whom preceded the Cambridge editors. 
White's text was characterized by a regard for 
the general superiority of the First Folio, duly 
tempered with a sense of its defects ; by great 
acuteness in eliciting the meaning of obscure 
passages; and by occasional boldness in emen- 
dation. He was really a pioneer in his deter- 
mined restoration of Elizabethan forms and 
spellings whenever modernization threatened to 
impair either sense or beauty. He was the first, 
for example, to restore the possessive it, and to 
reduce to regularity the manifest intention of 
the Folio printers in respect to the pronunciation 
or elision of e in the termination ed. Not 
always of course, was his judgment sure. In so 
characteristic a Shakespearean phrase as " Now 
is he turned orthography " (Much Ado, ii. 3. 2 1), 
he deserted both Quarto and Folio for Rowe's 
emendation, "orthographer." And in the equally 
characteristic "It were an alms to hang him" 
(Ibid. 164), he followed Collier's folio, printing 
"It were an alms[-deed] to hang him." It 
may be said in passing that he adopted more 
than a hundred readings from Collier's folio 
marginalia, a sufficient evidence that he was 
willing to accept that critic's emendations on 
their own merits. The volumes were pro- 
vided with introductions and notes, a memoir of 
Shakespeare, an essay on his genius, and a his- 
torical sketch of the text; and all this matter 
has been faithfully retained in the present new 
edition, with only such editing as the additional 
light of fifty years seems to require. The " Me- 
moirs" read a little oddly in this day of cold 
documentary biography: 

"To the now childless couple there came consolation 
and a welcome care in their first-born son, whom, on the 
26th of April, 1564, they christened and called William. 
. . . Of the day of his birth, there exists, and probably 
there was made, no record. Why should it have been 
otherwise ? He was only the son of a Warwickshire 
yeoman," etc. 

Yet the very slight annotation that has been 
called for on the part of the revisers testifies 
alike to White's thoroughness and accuracy, 
and to the meagreness of later additions to our 
knowledge. 

Before examining the editorial work of this 
new edition, it should be noted that White, late 
in life, agreed with another publisher to apply 
his ripened scholarship to the task of revision, 
the result of which was the Riverside edition 
of 1883. The text of the "Riverside" shows 
countless variations from his earlier text in the 
minor details of punctuation, etc., and appears 



1912.J 



THE DIAL 



333 



to have been set up from the Globe edition of 
the Cambridge editors, with which it tallies 
closely in these details. At the same time, it pre- 
serves the more distinctive features of White's 
first text, and there is abundant evidence to sup- 
port his statement that the revision had received 
"in the most minute particulars his careful 
attention." Though stoutly asserting his dis- 
trust of all conjecture, he ventured upon several 
emendations bolder than any in his first text. 
Thus, the famous "dram of eale" which "Doth 
all the noble substance of a doubt To his owne 
scandle" (Hamlet, i.4.36) becomes 

" The dram of evil 

Doth all the noble substance oft adulter 
To his own scandal." 

And any one familiar with Prince Hal's rebuke 
to Falstaff, " Peace, chewet, peace ! " (1 Henry 
IV., v. 1. 29), will experience some conflict of 
emotions when he reads 

" Peace, suet, peace ! " 

Likewise, to Celia's question, " But is all of 
this for your father?" (As You Like It, i. 3. 
10), Rosalind is not permitted to give the tra- 
ditional answer, " No, some of it is for my child's 
father," but * "t 

" No, some of it is for my father's child." 
This change, he declared, was not made on any 
ground of Rosalind's delicacy, but solely because 
the text does not give the fitting spontaneous 
reply. It is very certain that White's judgment 
in these matters was never warped by sentiment, 
as Dr. Furness's sometimes was. For prosaic 
passages, at least, the more prosaic interpreta- 
tion was likely to meet his approval. When 
Benedick suspects Claudio of being in love, be- 
cause, forsooth, " When was he wont to wash his 
face ? ' ' White accepted the words quite literally, 
remarking that in Shakespeare's time our race 
had not yet abandoned itself to a reckless use 
of water. Lowell, never over-reverent himself 
when there was any opportunity for a jest, 
protested against this vulgarizing of Benedick's 
meaning, maintaining that " wash " referred to 
cosmetics. But there is no evidence that White 
ever heeded the protest. And the present writer 
feels that if he could have submitted to White 
a very simple interpretation of one of Lear's 
mad utterances, " We '11 go to supper i' the 
morning " the interpretation, namely, that the 
neglect of Lear's daughters in not having din- 
ner ready for him on time is still rankling in 
his mind, he would have found one sym- 
pathetic listener. 

Turning now to the new edition which 
bears the imprint of the same house that issued 



the first, fifty years ago we find it to be sub- 
stantially a reprint of that first edition, with 
occasional slight variations in the text, and with 
the original notes edited and often abridged to 
make room for others added by the revisers. As 
for the text itself, it is hard to see wherein it 
has gained by this revision, since the work ap- 
pears to have been done with either too little 
care, or too much caution, to justify its being 
done at all. For example, the opportunity was 
not taken to throw out the disfiguring "alms 
[-deed] " mentioned above, though White him- 
self discarded it in his own revision. We still 
have White's earlier punctuation in "moving, 
delicate," and " mannerly, modest," though he 
later agreed with the Cambridge editors in think- 
ing that " moving-delicate " and " mannerly- 
modest" better express Shakespeare's intention. 
We still have the nonsense of " Doth not the 
gentleman Deserve as full, as fortunate a bed, 
As ever Beatrice shall couch upon ? " though 
here again White, along with the Cambridge 
editors, reverted to the correct original texts, 
expelling the intruded first comma. And we 
still have the old spellings in " Full fadom five 
thy father lies," and " With twenty mortal mur- 
thers on their crowns," which White (very un- 
reasonably, we think, even in his day) insisted 
on retaining. The textual variations that have 
been admitted are faithfully indicated, but 
usually with nothing to tell whether they are 
alterations adopted by White himself in his 
second edition, or new alterations made by the 
revisers. Indeed, the second, or Riverside 
edition, gets rather scant courtesy ; there is 
even, for example, no hint of White's emenda- 
tion of the famous " dram of eale " passage 
mentioned above. 

The revisers' own notes are marked by great 
caution. As gleanings from the contributions 
of modern editors, they are useful, but there is 
seldom a note of independent value. Modesty, 
of course, was to be preserved, in deference to 
the scholar whose merit they have so handsomely 
acknowledged. Yet it seems, for instance, a little 
naive to remark, upon Hamlet's " too too solid 
flesh," that "White collected several passages in 
which adverbs were used in this way ' with inten- 
sifying iteration,' " when every reader of Eliza- 
bethan literature knows that these reduplications 
were plentiful as blackberries, and that it is 
rather our modern ears that find a peculiar inten- 
sification in them. Again, when Shakespeare 
writes (Sonnet II.), "This fair child of mine 
Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse," 
we are told in a note that " old is obscure, pos- 






334 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



sibly it means ' complete,' see Wyndham." But 
"my old excuse" means simply " excuse for my 
age," an elliptical form of expression that can be 
paralleled in Shakespeare a hundred times over. 
There appears to be a change in the character 
of the notes in the last few volumes, beginning 
with " Hamlet," which may be due to the unfor- 
tunate death of Professor Henneman while the 
work was in progress. Of course, the purpose 
of the revisers was merely to bring the work up 
to date, without making any profession of afford- 
ing new light. The sum of the matter is that 
for the Shakespearean student who has access 
to White's own editions, this new edition, how- 
ever scholarly and accurate in the main, is 
negligible. 

But for the Shakespearean reader and book- 
lover, it is quite otherwise. The publishers have 
cooperated in producing a charming set of 
books. The type is very large, the lines are 
unobtrusively numbered, and the more import- 
ant notes are set at the bottom of the page. 
There are forty-eight illustrations, mostly Gou- 
pil photogravures from paintings, for example, 
Carl von Haff ten's " Elsinore " and Ford Madox 
Brown's " Cordelia's Portion." The set has 
been prepared in various forms, to suit various 
tastes and purposes ; but for the buyer of mod- 
erate means and for actual use, the " pocket 
edition," in full limp leather, would appear to 
be very near perfection. The volumes differ 
from those of many such editions in possessing 
the dignity of real books, being large enough 
to look well on the shelf, though still small 
enough to be slipped conveniently into the 
pocket. It is the sort of edition that invites 
intimacy and begets a lifelong attachment. 

ALPHONSO GERALD NEWCOMER. 



A WOULD-BE DISTURBER or THE 
WORLD'S PEACE.* 



In the course of history the Saxon race came 
to power and greatness. It still possesses its 
greatness, but has lost its power. This loss of 
power is to be attributed to several circum- 
stances, chief among which are the entrance of 
new powers into the international arena, the de- 
velopment of land-transportation making these 
newer nations independent of sea- transportation, 
and the decline of militancy among the Saxons 
themselves. This condition of things promises 
to end the greatness of the Saxon, and to give 

* THE DAY OF THE SAXON. By Homer Lea. New York: 
Harper & Brothers. 



the dominance in world affairs to others. If 
the Saxon race is to survive, it must abandon 
its foolish complacency, it must revive its mili- 
tancy through universal compulsory service im- 
posed by the government, and, finally, it must 
establish the military and naval unity of the 
Empire and the complete separation of the mili- 
tary and naval systems from the civil govern- 
ment of the dominions and the colonies. 

Thus runs the argument of " General " Homer 
Lea's " The Day of the Saxon." That it is not 
a new argument will be instantly obvious. But 
simple as the proposition is, these pages, which 
overflow with clever epigrams and other evi- 
dences of literary skill, befuddle rather than 
elucidate it by endless repetition and especially 
by the cocksure manner in which the author's 
views are stated. This assurance does not con- 
fine itself to interpreting the past or construing 
the present in a definitive way ; the author even 
presumes to look into the future, and with the 
same finality of judgment. 

"Japan's maritime frontiers must extend eastward 
of the Hawaiian Islands and southward of the Philip- 
pines. . . . Because of this Japan draws near to her 
next war a war with America. . . . The nation's 
[meaning the United States] vain and tragic scorn of 
the soldier, predetermines the consummation of this 
fatal combat. . . . Subsequent to this war the strategic 
position of the British Empire in the Pacific becomes 
so vulnerable as to be subject to the will of Japan." 
(Pp. 92-3.) 

In these days of deliberation and scientific 
reflection a mere assertion is not convincing, 
however categorically it may be made ; and 
hence the axiomatic way in which this believer 
in war and the inevitability of conflict asserts 
his opinions will not in the least impose upon 
cool and well-informed men. If this book came 
only into the hands of such it could simply be 
ignored. In the hands of others it may do real 
harm, for it bristles with a show of learning and 
scientific understanding of world affairs that 
will catch the unlearned with consequences none 
the less dire because of its flamboyant preten- 
sions. The author, though never affiliated with 
any recognized military organization, has in 
other connections posed as a " lieutenant- 
general," and speaks as though he were an au- 
thority on military and naval matters. Phrases 
such as " strategic triangles," " arcs of invasion," 
" angles of convergence," " military spheres," 
"specific arcs of the British circle," and for- 
midable explanatory charts constructed on prin- 
ciples which themselves need explanation, help 
to give a show of learning. " General laws," 
" elemental principles," and " fundamental con- 



1912.J

ditions " tread on each other's heels. The au- 
thor deducts laws from the course of history 
that would startle even Buckle or Taine. " The 
political relationship that exists among nations, 
far from being complex, is reducible to two 
general principles " (p. 25). "The expansion 
of nations is not an erratic progress, but is con- 
trolled and directed by known laws" (p. 91). If 
all the claims made by "General" Lea were true, 
if all laws governing human relationships were 
to be ascertained so positively, this book would 
be one of the greatest helps known to man for 
obtaining universal peace ; for we should know 
exactly what not to do to avoid war. 

The prescient author gives a simple prescrip- 
tion by which the Saxon may yet save himself 
ere it be too late (p. 239) . Just how " General " 
Lea knows so surely the way to save the Saxon 
is of the highest interest, considering that " in 
this epoch of war upon which the Empire is 
about to enter, hopes of peace are futile, con- 
stitutions and kings and gods are without avail " 
(p. 24). Would that he had also told us why 
the Saxon should be saved ; and what is to be 
done if some Teutonic or Slavic Homer Lea 
teaches his race how to overthrow the Saxon. 

We find another inconsistency. The Saxon 
has loudly boasted of the benefits he has con- 
ferred upon society by developing and protect- 
ing liberal institutions ; and, indeed, this is one 
of his chief titles to fame. Yet our author, who 
would save the Saxon, states categorically that 
" a nation retrogrades in universal political intel- 
ligence in proportion as its international affairs 
are controlled by popular prejudice" (p. 26). 
That he should consistently oppose democracy 
is natural, for he realizes, as have others, that 
war and democracy are incompatible. Since 
there must be a choice, let us keep democracy 

and abolish war. ^ T ^

THE How AND WHY OF BEAUTY 
UGLINESS.* 



" Why should the perception of form be ac- 
companied by pleasure or displeasure, and what 
determines the pleasure in one case and the 
displeasure in another?" 

In some form or other this question has been 
asked by every intelligent owner of a pair of 
eyes; and he who cares to seek in books will 
find a thousand answers. ^Esthetic apprecia- 
tion has been described as everything from a

direct gift of God, or a seduction of the devil, 
to a phenomenon of the larger viscera. To-day 
the tide is setting strongly toward the physio- 
logical side. We may feel an irresistible glow 
before Plato's peerless and golden periods on 
the meaning of beauty; but for a reasoned 
explanation we turn to the applied results of 
individual observation or laboratory research, 
although not a few conservatives still resent 
what Bosanquet calls " analytical intermeddling 
with the most beautiful things we enjoy." 

Our present volume embodies many experi- 
ences and a few conclusions of two talented 
observers, who have enjoyed admirable opportu- 
nities for the leisurely appreciation of European 
galleries and are also familiar with the litera- 
ture of the subject and the methods of aesthetic 
investigation in German and American labora- 
tories. Furthermore, the well-known personal- 
ity of "Vernon Lee" (Miss Violet Paget, who 
is the senior editor, so to speak) inclines one to 
turn a ready ear to any of her views on art or 
literature. 

The nucleus of the book is an essay printed 
in 1897 under the caption, "Beauty and 
Ugliness." To this have been added chapters 
on "Anthropomorphic ^Esthetics," "^Esthetic 
Empathy," "The Central Problem of Esthet- 
ics," and " ^Esthetic .Responsiveness, its Varia- 
tions and Accompaniments." This last, which 
is the longest chapter, consists of extracts from 
gallery diaries of "Vernon Lee," giving the 
"rough material of personal experience" that 
has gone to mould her view. 

From the foregoing it will be clear that any 
serious discussion of differences of opinion 
would imply a treatise equal in length to the 
376 pages of the text, so we must limit ourselves 
to a very brief summary. The three central 
points examined by the authors are as follows: 

1. ^Esthetic perception of visible shapes is 
agreeable or disagreeable because it involves 
alterations in great organic functions, princi- 
pally respiratory and equilibratory. Such is 
Miss Paget's wording of the aesthetic application 
of the Lange- James theory of bodily emotion. 

2. The phenomenon of aesthetic Einjuhlung 
(Lipps), or, as Professor Titchener has trans- 
lated it, Empathy. " In looking at the Doric 
column, for instance, and its entablature, we 
are attributing to the lines and surfaces, to the 
spatial forms, those dynamic experiences which 
we should have were we to put our bodies into 
similar conditions." 

3. The Inner 'e Nachahmung of Karl Groos, 
or something analagous thereto. " ' The exist- 



336

[Nov. 1, 



ence of muscular adjustments more considerable 
than those of the eye,' resulting in a sense of 
direction and velocity to the lines thus per- 
ceived." 

Of course the three theories implied by these 
headings have been the subject of no little 
discussion for many years ; but the interesting 
feature is that our authors before publishing 
the original essay on "Beauty and Ugliness" 
had arrived at their conclusions quite independ- 
ently, not from oral information or from publi- 
cations, but "by accidental self -observation in 
the course of art historical and practical artistic 
studies." 

As to the validity and relative importance of 
the three lines of explanation, our two observers 
have manifestly experienced no little fluctuation 
of opinion. In the final chapter, however, Miss 
Paget concludes that the dynamic-emphatic in- 
terpretation is to be emphasized, but that " for- 
mal dynamic empathy" is due, " not to actually 
present movements and muscular-organic sen- 
sations, but to the extremely abstract ideas of 
movement and its modes residual from count- 
less individual and possibly racial experiences." 
Yet she still attributes importance to imitative 
movements and mimetic-organic sensations, be- 
cause they may " possibly afford a clue to the 
origin of the odd fact of our associating move- 
ment and energy with objects and patterns." 
And, finally, the aesthetic pleasantness or un- 
pleasantness of shapes is not due to eye move- 
ment or any movements connected therewith, 
but to " the mental process of formal dynamic 
empathy, to the interplay of forces suggested 
by those shapes, and to the pleasantness or 
unpleasantness of such inner dramas of abstract 
movement-and-energy associations." 

At this point, assuming it is ever reached, the 
clear-sighted reader will conclude either that the 
reviewer is impatient or that we are discussing 
one of the books that are the despair of all 
honest critics. There is more truth in the latter 
alternative. The volume contains a wealth of 
material, with a number of important conclu- 
sions, and it is better to have it in this form 
than not to have it at all; but the reader has 
to mine most gropingly for the gold, and the 
friendliest of reviewers cannot blink the fact 
that the whole series of essays should have been 
recast and given to us in a finished form. 
After all, the student of aesthetics and the gen- 
eral reader alike have a right to demand that 
even the most capable authors shall make their 
presentation as clear and helpful as a difficult 
subject will allow.

there is an unusual number of errors in the Ger- 
man quotations. It is sparingly but adequately 
illustrated, and provided with a good index.

REGENERATING OUR JUDICIARY.* 

When the American Colonies separated from 
England they named among their grievances a 
tyrannical executive and an insecure judiciary. In 
setting up state governments for themselves, the 
Americans sought to guard against the former evil 
by reducing the executive to little more than a mere 
figure-head, while making the legislature almost 
omnipotent. The real grievance in the case of the 
judiciary was that it was subservient to a power 
over which they had no control, and whose interests 
were different from those of the Americans. Failing 
to discern this, they took the control of the judiciary 
entirely away from the executive and made it almost 
independent of the legislature and of the people. 

The mistake of a weak executive soon became 
apparent, and was avoided in defining the position 
and power of the President of the United States. 
Gradually the state executives were also elevated 
in position and power, while the tendency ever since 
has been to limit the power of the legislatures. 
Within recent years popular distrust of the law- 
making bodies has become very general. In some 
states this distrust has become so acute as to lead to 
the adoption of the Initiative and the Referendum, 
the professed object of which is to recover for the 
people the power of government. 

Of late the third division of our government, the 
judiciary, has also been subjected to searching criti- 
cism. This criticism has been general, ranging all 
the way from our most conservative citizens to the 
most radical agitators. Even President Taft has 
suggested that a reform in procedure is needed. 
Practically all the party platforms have had some- 
thing to say on the subject. Labor leaders have made 
their complaints, the state executives have gone so 
far as to appoint a committee to voice their protest, 
and even dissenting judges have joined the army of 
the discontented. 

The existence of the distrust of the judiciary 
cannot be denied. Mr. Gilbert E. Roe, in his book 
entitled " Our Judicial Oligarchy," explains it as due 
to (1) the usurpation of the power to declare laws

null and void ; (2) the growing practice of declaring 
laws void simply because the judges disapprove of 
them; (3) the fact that judges have become law- 
makers through the power of interpretation ; and (4) 
the fact that the poor man is not on an equality with 
the rich man in the courts. 

That the power to void laws is a usurpation is in 
the main the view of Mr. Gustavus Myers also, 
though he does not hold without qualification that 
it is a usurpation on the part of the United States 
courts, but that it was a clear case of usurpation in 
case of the state courts, which had pretty well estab- 
lished the practice before the Constitution was drawn 
up. Taking advantage of that fact, he thinks, the 
f ramers of the Constitution so constructed that instru- 
ment that the judiciary, which they expected to be 
the bulwark of protection for property against democ- 
racy, must inevitably exercise the power. 

That this power is not a usurpation was clearly 
pointed out by Professor Charles A. Beard in the 
"Political Science Quarterly" for March, 1912, and 
his work has been greatly supplemented and strength- 
ened by Professor Andrew C. McLaughlin. After 
citing numerous cases of the exercise of the power 
by the state courts prior to 1787 and giving quota- 
tions from contemporaries in support of it and ex- 
plaining the origin of the practice in the Supreme 
Court of the United States, he gives the most rational 
explanation of the custom which the present reviewer 
has yet seen. "They [the courts] asserted this 
power," he says, " not because they were superior 
to the legislature, but because they were independ- 
ent." This makes it a natural consequence of put- 
ting into practice the theory of the separation of 
power. He might have continued and pointed out 
that the present exalted position of the judiciary is 
largely due to the tendency toward supine submis- 
sion on the part of the executive and the legislature. 
At least one executive declared that he had as much 
right to his opinion of the Constitution as the Chief 
Justice did to his, and refused to enforce the court's 
decree. 

It cannot be denied that the courts have often 
strained the constitutional point in order to declare 
void a law of which the judges disapproved. Such is 
the only rational explanation of decisions upholding 
laws regulating the hours and conditions of labor 
for women and children, and overturning similar 
laws when designed to protect adult males. The 
courts say that the rule of reason must govern such 
laws, and by these decisions they have arrogated to 
themselves the sole power to exercise reason in such 
cases. 

The next step is to legislation by judicial decision. 
Many cases are cited by Mr. Roe and Mr. Myers, 
but the most notorious is that of the Standard Oil 
case. In 1897 the Supreme Court, speaking through 
Mr. Justice Peckham, said that they were "asked 
to read into the [Sherman] act by way of judicial 
legislation an exception that is not placed there by 
the lawmaking branch of the government," that is, 



insert the word " unreasonable "; but this they re- 
fused to do. Mr. Justice White dissented. Some 
years later, when Mr. Justice Peckham and his sup- 
porters of 1897 were gone, Mr. Justice White was 
elevated to the position of Chief Justice and made 
glad the hearts of the corporations by reading in the 
word " unreasonable" by way of judicial legislation. 

The poor man is not on an equality with the rich 
in the courts, not because he has no money to employ 
an attorney or bribe the judges for outright bribery 
is very rare, but because the judges, having for- 
merly served as corporation attorneys, naturally lean 
toward the interests and think in terms of vested 
rights. With them whatever has been still is right, 
and they continue to draw upon precedents hoary 
with age. Our own courts still cite English prece- 
dents long since outlawed there, for example, the 
Priestly Case, which is not yet fully abandoned here. 
Well may the people exclaim, " Who shall deliver 
us from this body of death ? " the dead hand of an 
unjust past. It will not be surprising at no distant 
day to hear the lawyers themselves praying for a 
second Alexandrian fire to consume the court re- 
ports, and for legislation to prohibit, or at least 
greatly limit, their future publication. 

Those who suppose that judges formerly lived in 
the clear empyrean, above politics and the thought 
of sordid wealth, will be surprised, not to say shocked, 
at the revelations made by Mr. Myers in his " His- 
tory of the Supreme Court." The main purpose of 
his book is to show the close relationship that has 
always existed between the judiciary and the inter- 
ests. Some of his statements are not altogether con- 
vincing, but many others are. In consequence, many 
of our heroes begin to lose some of that sanctity with 
which they have hitherto been enshrined. Hamilton, 
James Wilson, the Morrises, Livingstons, Schuylers, 
Gorham, Dayton, and others become ordinary mor- 
tals following the devious ways of gain, some of 
them through fraud and deceit. The most common 
avenues of wealth in those days were the acquire- 
ment of vast tracts of land, trade, and banking. The 
very first justices of the Supreme Court, Wilson, 
Gushing, Blair, Iredell, Johnson, Paterson, and 
Chase, are shown to have been allied directly or 
indirectly with the men following these paths of 
wealth. Even Jay, hitherto regarded as no less 
immaculate than the ermine which fell upon his 
shoulders, was so intimately connected by inherit- 
ance, marriage, and business alliance with the land- 
grabbers that one may be pardoned for having some 
doubts about his disinterestedness. As for James 
Wilson, lately praised by Mr. Roosevelt as a learned 
jurist, he is found to have been a shrewd Scotchman 
concerned in almost every questionable land deal of 
any magnitude, from that of the half-million acre 
deal in the Connecticut Reserve and the three- 
million acre transactions of the Holland Company 
in New York, to the stupendous fraud of thirty-five 
million acres in the Yazoo Land Company. His 
banking experience in Pennsylvania, when the legis-

lature repealed the charter of his bank, taught him 
a lesson, hence the clause in the Constitution forbid- 
ding laws impairing the obligations of a contract, of 
which he was the author. 

As for John Marshall, Mr. Myers has left prec- 
ious little of that halo which so long surrounded his 
head and which Mr. Jesse F. Orton did so much to 
destroy a few years ago. It is impossible even to 
outline here the story of his questionable acts. From 
one or two we may learn the character of the rest. 
Shortly after the Yazoo grant was secured from 
the Georgia legislature by corrupt methods, Wilson 
and his associates hurriedly transferred several mil- 
lion acres to a group of New England capitalists. 
When the next legislature wrathfully rescinded the 
grant, these purchasers set up the defense that it 
was impairing a contract and was injuring innocent 
purchasers. It is a well-settled principle of law that 
fraud vitiates a contract, and that there is no such 
thing as an innocent receiver of stolen goods. If a 
man buys stolen goods in ignorance of the theft he 
not only secures no title, but must suffer the loss. 
But Marshall complacently passed over the bribery 
as a mere fiction, and protected the "innocent pur- 
chasers" by declaring the original grant a contract 
and therefore irrepealable. An individual who has 
had his horse stolen may have a right to recover it 
even from an " innocent purchaser " but, by some sort 
of legerdemain, when the government, that is, the 
people, has been robbed of land, the innocent pur- 
chaser gets a vested right and the public must lose. 

At this time Marshall had his heart set upon ac- 
quiring "Leeds Manor," on some of Lord Fairfax's 
stealings, the claim to which he had bought. When 
Marshall's case came up he absented himself while 
Story, who had recently lobbied some bank charters 
through the Massachusetts legislature for himself 
and others, rendered the decision. Virginia had 
confiscated the property of British subjects and did 
not allow aliens to hold land in her borders. Yet 
Story held that the Fairfax claim was valid. When 
the Virginia Supreme Court denounced the decision 
and defied the court, Story calmly reaffirmed his 
own decision and Marshall got his manor. One 
good turn deserves another. These decisions about 
the impairment of contracts and the innocent pur- 
chasers opened the floodgates of fraud which have 
not yet been closed. A few years after the Fairfax 
case one of Lord Baltimore's heirs was suing Charles 
Carroll for quit rents. After the foregoing decision 
one may reasonably be astonished to find Story 
upholding the Maryland law which abolished quit 
rents. 

Having been true to the land-grabbers, the cor- 
porations, and the slaveholders, Marshall was fol- 
lowed by Taney, the special tool of the last class. 
Then came Chase, put in to validate the anti-slavery 
legislation and to uphold the interests of his clients, 
the bankers. Such is the meaning of the first legal 
tender case. But the railroads did not like this 
decision, and they had their attorneys, Bradly and 



Strong, appointed to reverse it. And ever since, the 
corporate interests have generally managed to keep 
on the bench a majority favorable to them. 

Mr. Myers nowhere charges the Supreme Court 
judges with venal corruption. On the contrary he 
says that, on the whole, they have been peculiarly 
free from it when it was all too common elsewhere. 
But he does charge that they have been dominated 
by the ever-expanding capitalist class, which has 
worked its will by ceaseless fraud and bribery. In 
many instances they have been the paid attorneys 
of the interests before going on the bench, and they 
have naturally leaned to them rather than to the 
common man. 

No wonder, then, that the courts have, in many 
cases, blocked the wheels of progressive legislation. 
What is the remedy? The recall of judicial deci- 
sions, say Mr. William L. Ransom and Mr. Theo- 
dore Roosevelt. When Mr. Roosevelt first made 
this proposal it was received by many with derision 
and denunciation. But of the many propositions 
he has hurled at the American people of late, the 
recall of judicial decisions rightly understood seems 
by all odds the best. 

To set this proposition before the people in its 
true light is the object of Mr. Ransom's book on 
"Majority Rule and the Judiciary." Mr. Roosevelt 
never has advocated, as many have assumed without 
investigation, the indiscriminate recall of decisions. 
Suits at law and criminal cases are entirely out of 
consideration; but when the courts set themselves 
in opposition to the will of the people as expressed 
in a law by declaring the law unconstitutional, then 
the people should have the right, after due delibera- 
tion, of saying whether the court's decision shall 
remain, the law of the land. This, Mr. Ransom 
declares, is far less revolutionary than the recall of 
judges, which is rapidly growing in favor. To re- 
call the judge would not recall his decision, the 
real end in view. Often there is no real occasion 
to recall the judge, for he may be an honorable and 
upright man, who honestly believes the law uncon- 
stitutional. Many laws are overturned by a divided 
court. Then may not the people at least decide 
between the majority and the minority? 

The trouble with Mr. Roosevelt's proposition is, 
not that it is too revolutionary, but that it does not go 
far enough. He would apply it only to state courts. 
Why should even the Supreme Court be exempt? No 
court capable of rendering so foolish a decision as 
was handed down last spring in the mimeograph case 
(A. B. Dick Company) deserves any immunity. So 
outraged was the country that Congress at once took 
steps to recall this decision as far as applicable to 
future cases by amending the patent law on which 
the court claimed to have based its action. 

The recall of judges and of decisions will help to 
remedy matters ; but we need most of all to reclaim 
our courts from the control of corporation attorneys, 
who naturally think in terms of corporate interests.

BRIEFS OK NEW BOOKS. 

The typical That the informal essay is once 
American and more in high favor is indicated by 
some others. j.j ie j ar g e number of collections of 
essays now being published. Even our novelists are 
turning to this gracious form of literature; among 
them, Mr. Meredith Nicholson, whose collection of 
reprinted "Atlantic" papers bears the title, "The 
Provincial American" (Houghton Mifflin Co.). 
Three of these essays "The Provincial American," 
" Edward Eggleston," and "A Provincial Capital " 
are concerned with the ideals and achievements of 
the Hoosier State, where, according to the author, 
one finds, if anywhere, " typical Americans." The 
typical American is provincial, for " we have no 
national political, social, or intellectual centre," and 
every county is a unit, with its own courthouse, town 
hall, churches, school-houses. The typical American 
is, therefore, self-sufficient, so self-sufficient, in- 
deed, that the metropolitan tendencies of the rail- 
way, the telegraph, etc., are not likely to disturb our 
romantic variety. The typical American is also ex- 
tremely curious, eager to know what he can know 
of art, of politics, of other phases of human activity. 
He is fond of brooding and discussion, and is in- 
creasingly conscious of his own importance in our 
democratic society ; the sense of the mass the 
" fatalism of the multitude," in Mr. Bryce's phrase 
is virtually a danger that has been averted. He 
has instinctive common sense, and, despite the mis- 
givings of Matthew Arnold, can be relied upon to do 
the right thing. All of which is perhaps mainly 
another and illuminating version of the frequent re- 
mark that our farmers are the foundation of Amer- 
ican excellence. From that city of estimable men 
and women, twentieth-century Indianapolis, with its 
background of "Hoosier Olympians" (of whom Mr. 
Nicholson writes entertainingly in the initial essay), 
come these cheering and, we believe as well as hope, 
true views of the modern American. In only one re- 
spect is the author on decidedly uncertain ground, 
when he tells us that " the most appalling thing about 
us Americans is our complete sophistication "; com- 
pared with us, he asserts, the English, the French, 
the Italians are simply children. His evidence is 
our insistence on " bigness," our farmers' languidly 
ready adjustment to the automobile, our children's 
cool condescension in the use of the telephone. This 
evidence, though pertinent, is insufficient. If it is 
true that we are sophisticated in our attitude to auto- 
mobiles, skyscrapers, and other insignia of our ma- 
terial development, it is likewise true that we are 
little more than "children" in our attitude to lit- 
erature, music, painting, and the other tokens of 
intellectual and spiritual activity. The English 
reviews still refer, justly if unpleasantly, to "that 
quaint nawete which, since Dickens wrote ' Martin 
Chuzzlewit,' has never ceased to astound the inhabit- 
ants of older countries." Compared with the French, 
the English are naive in the world of ideas ; how 
far are we, then, from the humane sophistication of 



the French! Aside from this unconscious outcrop- 
ping, on Mr. Nicholson's part, of "the American 
brag," his views on American life are both wisely 
reasoned and agreeably presented ; he is, indeed, 
unmistakably one of our foremost essayists. " Should 
Smith Go to Church ? " is perhaps the most pene- 
trating of the essays ; when it first appeared in print 
it evoked so much discussion that no more need be 
said of it here. " Experience and the Calendar " 
and "The Spirit of Mischief" are delightful but 
too fragile. The "Confessions of a 'Best-Seller'" 
is disappointing, and, one might add, typically 
American in its nawete. 

Dr. Isador H. Coriat analyzes "The 
H y steria of Lad y Macbeth" (Moffat, 
Yard & Co.) in terms of the modern 
study of the abnormal mind. Hers is a case of hys- 
teria involving alternating personalities and attacks 
of somnambulism, in which the central inciting 
theme of the disorder breaks through to expression. 
The sleep-walking scene is but the culmination of 
the psychopathic state, the genesis and progress of 
which the drama discloses. Unsatisfied longing 
finds a substitute in ambition, and is reenforced by 
the suggestion of supernormal, mystic, and prophetic 
agencies. Macbeth is thus affected, and contagiously 
induces a yet more marked abnormality in his pre- 
disposed spouse. In her case the childlessness plays 
a direct part in the complex. The climax is but the 
inevitable issue of the slowly incubating psycho- 
pathic invasion; and the stages thereof give evi- 
dence of the growing abnormalities, the unsuccessful 
repressions, the increasing dissociation of mental 
states. Hallucination of sight and smell in both sub- 
jects, the automatic washing of the hands in Lady 
Macbeth, the recurrent troubled dreams, the rein- 
statement of the guilty scenes in momentary alarms, 
are realistic details true to the diagnosis. In all 
this the insight of Shakespeare receives an unusual 
tribute, though the view is anticipated in other lan- 
guage by one not unacquainted with the darker side 
of the mind, Coleridge. It is not at all implied 
that the dramatist followed consciously the sequence 
of episodes in the elaboration of his "case," but only 
that the same laws that dominate the unfoldment 
itself are reflected in the dramatic sense that guides 
the creative impulse of literary portraiture. And at 
this point critics will differ in their preferences of 
interpretation, some doubting whether the psycho- 
analysis replaces the interpretation on the level of 
motives weighed in the every-day balance, others 
finding a corroboration of such insight by the nicer 
instruments of science. The study is interesting 
in either light; and the evidence is set forth with 
conviction.

heard no more. He was seventy years old at the 
time of his death, but neither mind nor body had, 
until the very last, shown symptoms of senescence. 
Fortunately his own hand had prepared an account 
of his life up to his sixty-seventh year, and he had 
left notes and papers from which it was easily pos- 
sible for another to continue the record to the end. 
This final chapter has now been written by Mrs. 
Talmage, and the completed work, "T. De Witt 
Talmage as I Knew Him " (the " I " being of course 
the autobiographer himself), is issued in attractive 
octavo form by Messrs. E. P. Button & Co. Thomas 
De Witt Talmage was born at Middlebrook, New 
Jersey, being the youngest of twelve children, and 
not too heartily welcomed by parents already hard- 
pressed to provide for his numerous brothers and 
sisters. After leaving school he fancied his talent 
to lie in the direction of the law, and accordingly 
studied for that profession, but soon discovered his 
true bent and was early started in the calling which 
he did so much to distinguish. His autobiography 
is written in that straightforward, vigorous, heart- 
to-heart style which won him such popularity as a 
speaker and writer. Shrewdness and humor, warm 
human feeling, and an abounding vitality speak in 
its pages. An exultant sense of his own unusual 
endowments shows itself, not in a way to offend, 
here and there. "In the face of trial," he says in 
one place, " God has always given me all but super- 
human strength." And elsewhere: ''My Gospel 
field was a big one. The whole world accepted the 
Gospel as I preached it, and I concluded that it did 
not make much difference where the pulpit was in 
which I preached." The burning of three successive 
buildings (each known as the Brooklyn Tabernacle) 
erected for his vast congregation in Brooklyn, seemed 
indeed to indicate that his pulpit was to be no sta- 
tionary one. Mrs. Talmage's portion of the book, 
amounting to a quarter of the whole, is by no means 
the least interesting one. It presents the man as she 
and others of his intimates saw him, with apt selec- 
tions from his notes and other material. Good por- 
traits and an index are furnished. 



Under the curiosity-provoking title 
. f "Also and Perhaps" (Lane) Sir 

Frank Swettenham has gathered a 
number of bright and readable sketches, some of 
them airy trifles from the society world, others 
glimpses of the author's personal experiences, and 
still others more or less impersonal discussions of 
abstract questions. A few far-eastern descriptive 
sketches, such as one might look for in a book by a 
writer who has served as Resident-General of the 
Federated Malay States, and as Governor of the 
Straits Settlements, and who is, moreover, the author 
of previous works entitled "British Malaya," "The 
Real Malay," and "Malay Sketches," are to be 
found in the volume. Versatility and a considerable 
experience of life in various climes and among all 
sorts of people are among the characteristics illus- 
trated by these entertaining chapters. The two 



under the headings "Also" and "Perhaps" are in 
the form of sprightly dialogues between expert con- 
versationalists. Another, entitled " Some Proverbs," 
which begins with a familiar Anglicism ("Every one 
who thinks of what they say, either before or after 
they say it " . . . ), turns on the mutual contra- 
diction of certain popular aphorisms, as "absence 
makes the heart grow fonder'' and "out of sight 
out of mind," and also exposes the fallacy of certain 
other wise saws somewhat as Lamb has discoursed 
in his humorous and sprightly fashion on sundry 
popular fallacies of the same sort. In a more serious 
vein, and with insight into the deeper realities, the 
author discusses "first and last love," distinguishing 
between that first devouring but evanescent passion 
which represents "the concentrated desires of mil- 
lions of ancestors striving through our poor bodies to 
indulge their special predilections for light hair or 
dark, brown eyes or blue," and the later and more 
lasting attachment in which, as he says, " Never to 
misunderstand, that is the great secret. It covers 
so much. Not to expect the unreasonable, not to 
be disappointed with the obviously natural; not to 
forget that however close in sympathy a man and 
woman may be, they are differently constituted and 
cannot have identical inclinations at every moment 
of their lives. . . . Not to misunderstand, that is 
almost everything." The book is not only clever, 
in the best sense of the word ; it is also marked by 
sincerity and earnestness. 

The ancient Jt is positively refreshing to discover 
literature of that we have reached a stage in the 
Israel. discussion of the dry critical prob- 

lems of the Old Testament represented by such a 
volume as Dr. Henry T. Fowler's "History of the 
Literature of Ancient Israel" (Macmillan). For 
scores of years scholars have been wholly absorbed 
in the technique of biblical criticism, in the minutiae 
of Israel's ancient literature. This shop-work had 
to be done before any large discussion of the litera- 
ture could be presented. Dr. Fowler has utilized 
the best results of years of study and experience of 
a long line of scholars. The analysis of the pro- 
gressive school of biblical criticism forms the woof 
of his fabric. He has likewise rightfully assumed 
among the Israelites a common Semitic inheritance 
for an explanation of many of the traditions, cus- 
toms, and rites of religion found mentioned in the 
fragment of the literature of the Old Testament. 
Israel was simply one of the smaller Semitic peo- 
ples of antiquity, whose relations with its neighbors 
were close and often intimate. Granting these 
conditions, the author then proceeds to arrange the 
fragments of Hebrew poetry, prophecy, and narra- 
tion into chronological order. As prefatory to each 
section he presents briefly what he considers to have 
been the historical subsoil out of which the present 
product sprang, and even introduces such specimens 
of other literature as the Babylonian deluge story, 
to vivify his text. Such a background to each kind 
of literature is important and necessary. But even

all of this splendid presentation does not properly 
constitute a history of the literature of those times. 
Our conception of such a history would include a 
discussion in clear and succinct language of the rise, 
growth, and perpetuation of the thought, religious 
and otherwise, in ancient Israel. We should expect 
to find a coordination and articulation of the thought- 
life of Israel stretching throughout the entire period 
of its literary activity. Dr. Fowler has not quite 
reached this ideal. 

Professor C. Lloyd Morgan, in a 
experience t volume entitled " Instinct and Expe- 
rience" (Macmillan), returns to the 
insistent problem of the nature of the lower and the 
higher guidance of conduct, and the interpretation 
thereof as favoring the hypothesis of a system of 
ends or of mechanisms. Are instinct and intelli- 
gence separated by a chasm or united by an evolu- 
tionary bridge? Is the verdict of science decisive 
for philosophy ? Or must science await and reflect 
the judgment of philosophic interpretation? The 
controversy has long ceased to be one of terms or 
usage; the dissensions, though critical and at times 
minute, are real. The significance of observation 
and of the lower end of the biological scale is con- 
ceded. Shall we carry back to the simple beginnings 
the concepts demanded by the higher issues in which 
we move, shaping them to the lowlier order of 
events; or shall we find our clue in the lower, and 
in such, terms interpret the reconstruction of the 
higher? For those prepared to follow the more 
detailed ramifications of this problem as it presents 
itself to the critical minds of the day, Professor 
Morgan's book may be cordially recommended. 
Biologists have always had a taste for philosophy ; 
and in latter days philosophers have acquired an ear 
for the biological message. Yet the camps are dif- 
ferently organized. Romanticism has given way to 
realism in both; but the new allegiance reflects the 
persistent diversity of temperamental predilection. 
M. Bergson's "vital impulse" affects the biologist as 
a poetic intrusion rather than as a scientific concept. 
The man of science still clings to the study of pro- 
cess, and declines to take his interpretation from the 
study of sources, even though he may remove them 
from the region of the unknowable. Professor Mor- 
gan's valuable contributions to the analytic phases 
of animal behavior give special interest and weight 
to the probabilities that appeal to his philosophical 
judgment.

of Innocence" maintains, with some success, that 
the natural and reasonable thing to do, and the 
thing which as a matter of fact is always done, is 
to assume the prisoner to be guilty; in a later essay 
in this same volume Mr. Train maintains the op- 
posite thesis with equal success. There is a curious 
chapter on " Preparing a Criminal Case for Trial "; 
two statistical studies entitled, respectively, " Sensa- 
tionalism and Jury Trials" and "Why Do Men 
Kill?"; two exciting chapters on the work of detec- 
tives ; and a final series on the Camorra, the Viterbo 
trials, the Mafia, and the criminal Italian element 
in America. The author attended a part of the 
Viterbo session in person, and his decidedly favora- 
ble account of Italian criminal procedure is probably 
much more trustworthy than the lurid newspaper 
"stories" which have hitherto provided most of our 
information on this subject. 

The earlier "* have alwavs spoken of myself as 
journal of Marie if I were talking of some one else," 
Bashkirtseff. wr ites Marie Bashkirtseff in her 
"New Journal" (Dodd, Mead & Co.). If she had 
been able to do this, as she asserted and perhaps 
believed she had done, her journal might have been 
valuable as well as curious ; but the unfortunate child 
had been promenaded from one end of Europe to 
the other, and kept so constantly on exhibition in 
hotels and at fashionable resorts, that every phrase 
she uttered, still more every sentence she wrote, was 
planned with a startling effect in view. It is not 
truth but extravagance that this morbid twelve-year- 
old feminine Rousseau is seeking when she pens her 
Confessions. "I have determined to end this book," 
she writes, "for extravagant ideas rarely come to 
me in these days." This group of letters extends 
from January, 1873, to February, 1876, and deals 
with several more or less genuine love-affairs, the 
development of a singing voice whose defects had 
not yet been discovered, and dreary wanderings from 
Paris to Nice and from Nice to Paris, with a pur- 
poseless sojourn in Rome. These earlier letters have 
little value in themselves, although of course anything 
from so brilliant and poignant a writer as Marie 
Bashkirtseff later came to be has a certain interest. 
This part of the "Journal" appeared in a French 
magazine two years ago, and Miss Safford's transla- 
tion is probably no more vague and stilted than the 
original, although she is once or twice clearly inac- 
curate and now and then entirely unintelligible. 

It takes a sprightly woman with a 
human interest in everything that is 
beautiful, and with a facile pen to 
sketch it, to produce such an entertaining little vol- 
ume as Miss Jeannette Marks's "Gallant Little 
Wales" (Houghton Miffltn Co.). The author's in- 
terests are concentrated for the present in North 
Wales. She adopts the only sane method of study-

ing a people, she lives among them, observes their 
chief interests, their customs, their superstitions, 
their religious zeal, and their artistic temperament. 
She finds a fascination in the arrangements of their 
homes, the architecture of their hill-top churches, 
and the superb strength and character of their won- 
derful castles, such as Carnarvon, Beau Maris, and 
Conway. Her enthusiasm for Wales seems to have 
been either created or mightily stimulated by reading 
and pondering on the " Mabinogion "; many of her 
reflections and comparisons are based on the state- 
ments made in that famous collection of history 
and folklore. The history, both ancient and modern, 
of the little commonwealth is a quarry for her nar- 
rative. Dr. Samuel Johnson's trip through North 
Wales gives her an opportunity which she eagerly 
utilizes to sketch some of the most disagreeable traits 
of that otherwise great man. She pays her tribute 
to the marvellous nationalism of the Welsh people as 
seen in their annual musical festival, the Eisteddfod. 
Musicians, poets, and artists by nature, their patriot- 
ism for their own people shines out with greatest 
brilliancy in any Welsh event that appeals to their 
artistic or musical nature. The author intends to 
produce a companion volume dealing with South 
Wales. 

American T P ut the whole 8toI 7 of tn f origin 

history in and development of our nation into 

outline. ] es8 than three hundred pages of 

moderate size, and at the same time to make the 
story thoroughly readable, is not an easy thing to 
do. This Mr. Edwin W. Morse has undertaken 
in his " Causes and Effects in American History " 
(Scribner), and the verdict must be that he has suc- 
ceeded in his undertaking. Of course the details 
have been left out. The Civil War occupies but 
twenty pages, and the Revolution but twelve; yet 
the author has made these chapters interesting in 
manner and complete in outline from the side of 
cause and effect. Not everyone will agree with him 
in his interpretations, as he has had to touch many 
sharply controverted questions ; but he is fair in his 
treatment and in his judgments. The book is not 
confined to our political development, but traces 
also our industrial, commercial, and literary history 
down to the present year. It will hardly serve, as 
the author hopes, to interest young people in the 
subject, but it will be useful in interpreting our 
history to students and to readers who may have 
lost themselves in the details of the larger books. 

Records of the "The Celts in Antiquity," by Mr. 
Celts in Greek -m- -rv. . ,. , , i . i 

and Latin " Dinan, is one of the latest pub- 

literature. lications of the honored house of 

Nutt, which under the wise inspiration of the late 
savant, Alfred Nutt, has done more than any other 
to make accessible the documents relating to Celtic 
and mediaeval romance. It is the first of three vol- 
umes which will present in convenient form all ac- 
counts of the Celts which are found in ancient Greek 
and Latin writers. An accompanying English trans- 
lation, though it does not always adequately repro- 



duce the original, will be of service to the general 
reader. Persons competent to use the book for in- 
dependent researches will consult the original Greek 
or Latin, which is always printed in full. The book 
will save investigators of Celtic antiquities much 
arduous toil in searching for the texts they want 
among numerous scattered and often rather inacces- 
sible volumes. It is interesting to observe that the 
accounts of the Celts handed down by Greeks and 
Romans agree with the life pictured in the oldest 
Irish sagas, not only in general outline, but even in 
rather minute details. One is not surprised to find 
that both describe in similar terms the method of 
fighting from the war chariot. But it is a note- 
worthy testimony, both to the authenticity of the 
Irish sagas, and to the solidarity of the ancient Celtic 
race, to find the Greek and Latin writers telling of 
the habit of Celtic warriors to strive for the " hero's 
portion " at feasts, and of their tendency to resort to 
blood-shed in order to settle questions of precedence 
at the banquet, peculiarities which are related in 

the Irish sagas. 

Mr I ana's Perhaps the most important work of 
brie/ history Andrew Lang's declining years was 
of Scotland. ^is "History of Scotland from the 
Roman Conquest." An abridgment of this has now 
been published in a single volume entitled "A Short 
History of Scotland " (Dodd, Mead & Co.). To con- 
dense so large a work into a brief account of about 
three hundred pages must have been a difficult task ; 
but the result is fairly satisfactory. The chapters 
devoted to the middle ages are not all that might 
be desired ; but the author was not interested in the 
earlier period. His interest lay in the struggles of 
the Stuarts against grasping Englishmen and narrow- 
minded Presbyterian "preachers," and his treatment 
of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (which 
make up the bulk of the volume) have all the excel- 
lencies and defects that characterize the historical 
writings of this great Scotchman. It has been nec- 
essary to omit details, but the author's viewpoint is 
apparent on every page, and his chief conclusions 
have been included. Readers who are interested in 
Scottish history but do not feel equal to the more 
extended works will find Mr. Lang's "Short His- 
tory" an informing and entertaining book. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



" Rousseau's Einfluss auf Kliuger," by Mr. F. A. 
Wyneken, is a recent monograph issued from the Uni- 
versity of California Press. Klinger was one of the 
most interesting among the literary friends of Goethe's 
youth, although he has been well-nigh forgotten by all 
except professional students of literary history. 

Mr. Joseph McCabe, believing that Voltaire is neg- 
lected by the modern reader, who naturally shrinks 
appalled from the immense volume of his work, has 
translated a selection of his prose writings which should 
help the modern world to become familiar with his essen- 
tial thought. The volume is entitled " Toleration and 
Other Essays," and is published by the Messrs. Putnam.

Mr. J. W. Mackail's " Life of William Morris," one 
of the best of literary biographies, is reprinted by 
Messrs. Longmans, Green & Co. in their " Pocket Li- 
brary," of which it makes two volumes. Morris's 
" News from Nowhere " and Andrew Lang's " Books and 
Bookmen " are other reprints in the same handy series. 

Henry Morley's " A First Sketch of English Litera- 
ture," originally published in 1873, has gone through 
many editions, the latest of which, including a supple- 
ment bringing the history down to the deaths of Swin- 
burne and Meredith, the work of Mr. E. W. Edmunds, 
has just been published by Messrs. Cassell & Co. In its 
present form, the work runs to twelve hundred pages, 
which makes it possible to present an immense amount 
of detail. The supplement will be found very useful 
for reference, aside from its considerable critical value. 

Preparatory school teachers with Browning on their 
list of poets for classroom study will doubtless be very 
glad of the help offered them by Miss Ella B. Hallock 
in her " Introduction to Browning " (Macmillan). 
Eleven poems, followed in each case by two or three 
pages of suggestive questions designed to quicken the 
student's attention to the special meaning or charm of 
the poem in hand, make up a small volume of 130 pages. 
The selections are, for the most part, of the narrative 
type. Although Browning is not at his best in this 
form, this is perhaps the easiest way of approach for 
the juvenile mind. 

Mr. J. Herman Randall's "The Culture of Person- 
ality " (Caldwell) is divided into fourteen thoughtful 
chapters on various aspects of personality, on the train- 
ing of the mind, the mastery of the affections, the edu- 
cation of the will, and kindred themes. The general 
tone and purpose of the work may be indicated by a 
passage from the " Foreword." After quoting a page 
or two from John Fiske's " Destiny of Man " the author 
continues: "What is this, in other words, but simply 
the statement that the ultimate goal of this stupendous 
evolutionary process, which has been at work in the 
Universe from the beginning, is the development of the 
whole man, the true and deeper self, the human-divine 
personality ? It cannot be read otherwise. The total re- 
sult of all the scientific research, of all the wonderful dis- 
coveries of the last hundred years respecting Man and 
his life here upon the earth, reveals as the goal and end 
of all evolution, the perfectingof the human personality." 

The first casual impression gained from Messrs. 
Crowell's new edition of Browning is one of pleasure in 
the large type and open page. So accustomed have we 
become by long usage to associate Browning with 
cramped and minute typography that the contrast af- 
forded by the present edition is as delightful as it was 
unexpected. In these twelve volumes, of little more 
than ordinary pocket size, the whole of Browning's 
poetical work (with two of his essays in prose) is pre- 
sented in a type as large and a page as generously open 
as are generally found in the most cumbrous of editions 
de luxe. This fact alone is sufficient to make the edi- 
tion a favorite one, but it is not lacking in other merits. 
A full editorial apparatus of critical introductions and 
explanatory notes is supplied by Miss Charlotte Porter 
and Miss Helen A. Clarke, whose capabilities for a task 
of this sort were long ago demonstrated. Professor 
William Lyon Phelps contributes a brief general intro- 
duction, which the beginner in Browning will find of 
value. A photogravure frontispiece is included in each 
volume. Altogether, this seems to us by far the most 
desirable edition of Browning yet published. 



NOTES. 



A volume of " Portraits and Studies " by Mr. Edmund 
Gosse is announced for early publication. 

Three one-act plays by Mr. Eden Phillpotts will soon 
be published in a volume entitled " Curtain Raisers." 

"Norman Angell," author of "The Great Illusion," 
has in press for early issue a work on " International 
Finance and International Polity." 

" Adnam's Orchard " by Sarah Grand and " Where 
Are You Going To? " by Miss Elizabeth Robins are two 
forthcoming novels of some importance. 

Mrs. Reginald Wright Kauffman and her husband 
have recently completed an elaborate work to be entitled 
"The Latter-Day Saints: A Study of the Mormons." 

Mr. Booth Tarkington is just completing a new novel 
of American life, which is to be published next spring 
by Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. under the title of 
"The Flirt." 

A study of " The Influence of Baudelaire in France 
and England " has been made by Mr. G. Turquet-Milnes, 
and will be published in this country by Messrs. E. P. 
Dutton & Co. 

Publication of the two concluding volumes of John 
Bigelow's " Retrospections of an Active Life " has been 
considerably delayed, and they are not now likely to 
appear until Spring. 

It is good news that Sir E. T. Cook, the biographer 
and editor of Ruskin, has prepared a volume on " The 
Homes and Haunts of Ruskin," which will be published 
in a large volume with colored illustrations. 

Two forthcoming volumes of essays, by English 
writers, that will undoubtedly prove worth while are 
Mr. Arthur Ransome's " Portraits and Speculations " 
and Mr. Francis Grierson's " The New Era." 

In view of tke Home Rule Bill now impending in 
Parliament, especial timeliness and interest attach to 
a volume on " Aspects of the Irish Question " by Mr. 
Sidney Brooks, to be published at once by Messrs. John 
W. Luce & Co. 

The exclusive rights in English translation to a series 
of M. Fabre's wonderful insect stories have been acquired 
by " The English Review." The first of these stories, 
entitled " The Banded Spider," will appear in the No- 
vember number. 

In " Immigration and Labor," which Messrs. Putnam 
will publish about the middle of November, Mr. Isaac 
A. Hourwich, Ph.D., traces the causes of immigration 
to the United States and its effect upon the condition 
of American labor. 

An authorized translation of M. Edouard Le Roy's 
" Une Philosophie Nouvelle: Henri Bergson" is an- 
nounced by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. This house will 
also publish before long a satirical tale entitled " John 
of Jingalo " by Mr. Laurence Housman. 

A new edition of St. John de Crevecreur's " Letters 
from an American Farmer," with a complete biograph- 
ical introduction containing hitherto undiscovered ma- 
terial by Miss Julia P. Mitchell of Barnard College, will 
be issued in the spring by Messrs. Duffield & Co. 

Mrs. William O Brien's " Unseen Friends," just an- 
nounced by Messrs. Longmans, will contain studies of 
women who have played a noble part in the world's 
history. Among the well-known authors dealt with are 
Christina Rossetti, Mrs. Oliphant, and Charlotte Bronte. 

Robert Barr, the novelist and editor of the London 
"Idler," died at his home in Surrey on October 21>

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



Although born in Glasgow, Mr. Barr was educated in 
Canada, and for a time was on the editorial staff of the 
"Detroit Free Press." Since 1881 he has lived in 
England. 

It is reported that Gerhart Hauptmann is at work on a 
new drama dealing with Homer and his times. The first 
two volumes of Hauptmann's collected dramatic works, 
in English, and also a translation of his novel " Atlantis," 
will be issued at once by Mr. B. W. Huebsch. 

Adrian Hoffman Joline, an enthusiastic book collector 
and the author of several entertaining books about books, 
died in New York City on October 15. He was the 
author of " Meditations of an Autograph Collector," 
" Diversions of a Book Collector," " At the Library 
Table," and several other similar works. 

Publication of a new novel by Mr. James Lane Allen 
is always an event of literary importance. We learn 
that the Macmillan Co. will issue at once Mr. Allen's 
latest work, " The Heroine in Bronze." It is said to 
be the love story of an American college girl and a 
college man, the scene of which is laid in New York. 

Notwithstanding Meredith's threat that he would 
" most horribly haunt " anyone who wrote a biography 
of him, several industrious persons are already engaged 
upon the task. The first result will probably be the 
volume now being prepared by Mr. Thomas Seccombe 
for the series of " Literary Lives," published in this 
country by Messrs. Scribner. 

The first volumes of the eagerly-awaited "Loeb 
Classical Library" will be published immediately by 
the Macmillan Co. They include "St. Augustine's 
Confessions," "Euripides," "Terence," and "The 
Apostolic Fathers," each in two volumes, and " Proper- 
tius," in one. Other authors are to be added during 
the next few weeks, twenty volumes in all having been 
scheduled for the first year. 

The important announcement is made by Messrs. 
Lippincott that "Julius Csesar," the seventeenth volume 
in the " New Variorum Edition " of the works of Shake- 
speare, is in press for publication early in 1913. The 
preparation of this monumental edition was the life 
work of Dr. Horace Howard Furness. For the past 
few years he has been assisted by his son, Mr. Horace 
Howard Furness, Jr., who has contributed two volumes 
to the work, and to whom now falls the task of editing 
the remaining plays. 

Among the most interesting features of the "Atlantic" 
for the coming year will be a selection from Charles 
Eliot Norton's letters to Lowell and George William 
Curtis; " My Boyhood and Youth," by Mr. John Muir; 
"Tales of My People," by Miss Mary Antin; and 
" Confederate Portraits," by Mr. Gamaliel Bradford, 
Jr. To a series of articles on modern business affairs, 
Mr. George P. Brett, President of the Macmillan Co., 
will contribute a paper entitled " The Policies of 
Present-Day Publishing." 

The leading article in the October " Hibbert Journal " 
(Sherman, French & Co.) is " Democracy and Disci- 
pline," by the editor, Mr. L. P. Jacks. It points out 
the perhaps impossible standards of public obedience 
and flexibility necessary for the success of such social 
legislation as Lloyd-George is putting through in En- 
gland and as the Progressive party hopes to put through 
in America. With the exception of a paper on the 
American political and religious situation by a Massa- 
chusetts clergyman, the Rev. Frank Ilsley Paradise, 
the other articles in this number are theological or 
technically philosophic in their interest.

Memories of 
President Lincoln 

By WALT WHITMAN 

IN place of what would have been a large paper edition of 
Memories of President Lincoln from the same type used 
in The Lyric Garland, Mr. Mother has made in an entirely 
new format the present reprint of Whitman's greatest poem. 
This edition includes, as well, the full text of Lincoln's 
Gettysburg Address, a Foreword by Horace Traubel, to 
which is added selections from Mr. Frederick W. Lehmann's 
address, and a short but beautiful appreciation of Lincoln by 
the editor of the Saint Louis Mirror, William Marion Reedy. 
A selection is also given from John Burroughs as well as the 
great passage in full from Lowell's Commemoration Ode. 

The text of the poem is printed in i4-point old-style 
Roman, initial letters in green ink, with head-bands and 
tail-pieces of becoming dignity. As a whole this edition may 
be considered one of Mr. Mosher's choicest productions. 
The frontispiece from an original photograph of Lincoln 
cannot be excelled and is the exact size of the original negative.

BROWNING: POCKET EDITION 



Edited by CHARLOTTE PORTER and HELEN A. CLARKE. 
Introduction by Professor WILLIAM LYON PHELPS. Photogravure 
frontispieces. Set of 12 volumes, cloth, $12.00. Leather, $18.00. 
Volumes sold separately, in cloth at $1.00 and in leather at $1.50 
per, volume. 

The large-type " Pocket Edition " of the works of Robert Browning 
includes the complete output in verse of the great poet, as well as 
two essays in prose, and presents this matter in a form that leaves 
nothing to be desired by the most devoted Browning-lover. By the 
use of Bible paper the volumes have been made of compact size, 
delightfully easy to handle, and at the same time the type in which 
both text and bibliographical matter are set is large and clear, making 
restful, easy reading. The editors, Miss Porter and Miss Clarke, are 
two of the best-equipped students of Browning in this country or 
Europe. Their introductions and notes are full and scholarly, and, 
taken as a whole, shed all the light to be desired on the poet and his 
works. A valuable feature is the terse, clear digest given of every poem. A general 
introduction to the edition has been written by William Lyon Phelps, Professor of 
English Literature at Yale University. The excellence of the editorial work, the hand- 
some appearance of the text, and the general attractiveness of the volumes as master- 
pieces of skilful book-making unite to make this the ideal edition of Browning's works.

the actual points at issue : how to formulate the arguments bearing on those issues ; how to make these points clear and impressive 
to a hearer's mind ; and then how to stir his feelings and to carry him over to an active taking of sides.

Edited for American Teacher* by Elian M. Cyr. author of the " Cyr Readers " 

This book, the story of the author's experience as head mistress of the Sompting School, Sussex, England, is a revelation of the

directing instead of suppressing the natural activities of childhood.

has succeeded, with unfailing certainty of touch, in getting 
out of his study a remarkable and impressive effect." In 
the last of his books, which dealt with personal experiences, 
" The Silent Isle," the author promised the reader that he 
would some day tell how it was that the pleasant design 
that he had set for himself failed. The present book is the 
fulfilment of that promise.

OUli SPIRITUAL HEALTH. 



Is our culture in a bad way ? Are the ideals 
upon which the soul is fed growing less urgent 
in their appeal to the modern man? Do we face 
the prospect of a spiritual decline comparable to 
that which darkened the world when the ancient 
civilizations decayed, and mankind groped for 
centuries to rediscover the light that was lost? 
These are the questions raised by Dr. E. B. 
Andrews in "The International Journal of 
Ethics," where he discusses "The Decline of 
Culture" in a spirit which many will think un- 
duly pessimistic, but with a degree of earnest- 
ness which is deeply impressive. His diagnosis 
of our case does not indicate the menace of any 
barbarian invasion threatening to overwhelm 
our civilization, but rather places stress upon the 
internal causes that seem already to have gone 
far toward the undermining of our spiritual 
health. The culture which seems to him to be 
visibly declining is defined as " the appreciation, 
not contemplative alone but active and efficient, 
of the non-economic values." Its content is en- 
lightenment, breadth, open-mindeiness, chivalry, 
honor, generosity, magnanimity, justice, gentle- 
ness, devotion to principle, the courage of one's 
convictions, power to sustain, without courting 
it, loneliness, resisting popular clamors and mob 
movements, whether plebeian or patrician." It 
will be observed that this analysis has chiefly in 
mind the ethical rather than the assthetic aspect 
of culture. But even those of us who have 
framed our faith in accordance with the teach- 
ings of the most persuasive of the apostles of 
culture in our own day must remember his 
insistence upon the proposition that conduct is 
three-fourths of life. 

At first discussing the subject on some of its 
more general aspects, Dr. Andrews speaks of the 
prevailing modern tendency to shape thought 
and action into uniform moulds. The deaden- 
ing influences of fashion, of what Huxley called 
regimentation, of industrialism, bureaucracy, 
and centralization, are everywhere made mani- 
fest. " Science enables us to multiply infinitely 
all the things we invent and to throw them upon 
the market with cheapening profusion." "Let 
shallow people laugh at New England provincial- 
ism and berate the South for being solid. The 
wise rejoice that so much local apartness sur-

vives." " Centralization annuls not only the 
baneful and narrow in particularism but, worse 
still, its sap and vigor." Its steam-roller "flat- 
tens individuals into specimens." Where in 
such a world can character, originality, the will 
to strike into new paths, get foothold? "It is 
doubtful whether what might be called the sci- 
entific mind is holding its own. Superstition not 
unlike belief in ghosts is still wide-spread and 
rank." " There is wide remission of enthusiasm 
for humanity. Few think it articulately ; fewer 
avow it." If we have done something to check 
the crimes of violence, "the crimes of cunning, 
secret vices, tricks, however immoral and cruel, 
that can be worked in accordance with law, and 
especially offences against personal purity, are 
everywhere on the increase." The enumeration 
of morbid conditions in our social pathology 
is considerably more extended than the above 
array of quotations would indicate, and they are 
matter for much self-searching. 

More specifically, " the culture pyaemia in 
American society may be traced, in the main, 
to four great plexuses of influences : one, the 
country's astounding growth in wealth ; a second, 
the spread of communistic socialism ; a third, 
bad theory and practice in education ; and a 
fourth, depressing views of the world, life, and 
man." The dominance of the American ideal 
by the money-making spirit is so pronounced that 
it everywhere overshadows the higher values of 
life and the nobler objects of ambition. Success 
is judged by the test of the dollar, and the man 
who refuses to recognize the validity of this test 
is viewed askance as a freakish and abnormal per- 
son. The schools and the churches, the theatres 
and the concert-halls, must be made to "pay"; 
if they do not " pay," they are discredited. 
" Wealth-gaining is an obtrusive, all-engrossing 
phenomenon, overshadowing all else, massive, 
ubiquitous, obstreperous, never out of sight or 
out of mind." If culture is an " appreciation of 
the non-economic values," it has small chance of 
growth in such an environment. 

Socialism, which is everywhere gaining upon 
us, makes no attempt to conceal its levelling 
purpose. It is "a crusade against the highlands 
of men's life in the supposed interest of the bog." 
It is essentially a gospel of materialism, and its 
root appeal is to greed, however that term be 
disguised under such high-sounding names as 
justice and brotherhood. It would " build forth 
the social body utterly without regard to heter- 
ogeneity, allowing no place for the genius, the 
artist, the dreamer, the mugwump, the rebel. 
The church in its worst days never meditated 



rendering life so insipid." Coming to the third 
count of our critic's indictment, one of the chief 
foes of culture is education, which should be its 
agent and minister, but which instead, in its cur- 
rent tendencies, can see nothing for a school to 
do more important than preparing its victims 
for the task of earning their livings. " Pesti- 
lential," says Dr. Andrews, and the word is 
not too strong "is the cry for shorter courses, 
that young people may begin work earlier in life, 
earn more, and be surer of large families. There 
is no fear that our population will be too small, 
but much that it will be too mean." Rigid ad- 
ministrative systems and the preference given 
to utilitarian studies are draining our schools 
and colleges of their spiritual life, and making 
them factories of automata rather than institu- 
tions for the higher development of human 
faculty. How can a student whose education 
has been thus directed to narrow practical ends 
speak of his school as alma mater, with any sense 
of the significance of that beautiful expression ? 
Last of his four specific causes for the de- 
cline of culture, Dr. Andrews names the phi- 
losophy of naturalism, which makes a mechani- 
cal interpretation of the doctrine of evolution, 
discerning no purpose at work in the universe, 
and finds in the teachings of Nietzsche its log- 
ical outcome. " Naturalism can give no reason 
why any sentiment, impulse, or conviction 
which in any manner is of advantage to the 
race should be preferred to any other impulse 
or conviction as more worthy of consideration 
or obedience." "If naturalism is the truth, 
morality is but a haphazard catalogue of pru- 
dential regulations; beauty is unsubstantial 
and accidental, not eternal ; and even reason is 
nothing else but a habit by which our thoughts 
chance to take one course rather than another." 
To our thinking, the chief manifestation of 
declining culture is found in the very general 
prevalence of a spirit of indifferentism, of a 
moral apathy which leads men to think that 
nothing really matters unless it affects their 
own personal interests. This spirit can con- 
template the social and political issues of our 
own time, or the similar issues recorded in the 
pages of history, with hardly any other emotion 
than curiosity ; the reactions of enthusiasm and 
indignation are unknown to it; it does not 
really care whether a nation (even our own) 
keeps or violates its plighted faith with others, 
whether a Finland or a Persia is strangled by 
the brutal oppressor, whether a German Em- 
pire ruthlessly despoils its French and Danish 
neighbors. People ought to care for such things

as these more than for their daily bread, and 
a culture which can regard them with indiffer- 
ence, perhaps even with cynicism, is in perilous 
need of a physician. 

Although our author takes anything but a 
cheerful view of the present, he is not without 
hopes for the future, believing that "the sources 
of culture gush perennially." 

" In what quarter of the heavens dawn will first show, 
it were rash to predict. Socialism will run a long course, 
so will perverse education. There are happy signs that 
wealth-seekers are beginning to distinguish between 
wealth as a means and wealth as an end. Hardest to 
reform will doubtless be man's faith. Perhaps another 
Messiah will have to be awaited. Meantime, every child 
of the day may do somewhat to widen the skirts of light. 
As Emerson exhorts : ' Bend to the persuasion which is 
flowing to you from every highest prompting of human 
nature to be its tongue to the heart of man and to show 
the besotted world how passing fair is wisdom.' " 



THE RETURN OF THE GODS. 

There is no more remarkable occurrence in the 
vicissitudes of human thought than the birth, the 
rise to power as a State religion, and the final ex- 
pulsion of Buddhism from India. Before it came 
the gods of the Vedas reigned, sacrifice was offered 
them, the sacred hearth-fire was kept perpetually 
lighted, caste was rigidly guarded, the twice-born 
were regularly initiated and endued with the sym- 
bolic cord. Buddhism, while not a proselytizing or 
persecuting doctrine, swept away all these things 
within its limits. It was an agnosticism. It said 
that the gods were unknowable and that the soul did 
not exist. Buddhism could not shake oft' that cen- 
tral idea of Hindoo thought transmigration. But 
it transferred it from the soul to the character, 
Karma. The sum of a man's good and bad quali- 
ties went on living endlessly until the former extin- 
guished the latter, when Nirvana was attained. How 
character could persist on through innumerable re- 
births without being attached to a personality, is the 
difficult point of the doctrine. Beautiful and noble 
as Buddhism was in its ethics, its charity, and its 
democracy, it killed hope in the heart and imagina- 
tion in the mind. Humanity, Aryan humanity at 
least, could not stand it. After eight or ten cen- 
turies of growth and domination, it dwindled and 
practically disappeared from the land of its birth. 
The gods of the Vedas, new-incarnated, came back ; 
the hearth-fire burned again, and caste was renewed. 
And a great system of Vedanta philosophy, of which 
Sankara Acharya was the leading exponent, arose to 
justify the change. Of course, with the return of the 
gods and the belief in immortality, came back the 
demons and the punishments of hell. But the change 
was worth the cost. This new-old religion and philo- 
sophy gave man back his soul. 

In a smaller way, perhaps, it looks as if something 
of this kind was about to happen in Europe and 



America. For fifty years or more the Gorgon head 
of Evolution has turned the heart and soul of man 
to stone. Caught in a mechanical determinism, man- 
kind has lost its freedom the fluidity which before 
yielded to all impulses of religion, poetry, and art. 
If it tried to escape in philosophy, it found that 
philosophy was fixed in an iron system of concepts 
which opened only on nescience and nihilism. 

Recently the world has become aware of two 
great thinkers, Eucken in Germany and Bergson in 
France, who have certainly given a new movement 
to thought, and who may possibly herald a new era. 
To a large extent their philosophies run parallel. 
But Eucken's tends more in the direction of religion, 
Bergson's more towards an underlying metaphysic. 
The latter seems to be the more thorough, and, if it 
can be established, ought to prove the more liberat- 
ing of the two. 

Bergson's thought, intensely difficult as it is to 
grasp in its full development, is yet simple in its 
leading principles. As Darwinism became sum- 
med up in a few phrases, "natural selection," "the 
survival of the fittest," "the descent of man," by 
which the man in the street gained a not inadequate 
idea of the theory, so Bergsonism is concentrated in 
a few words or phrases, such as "intuition," "the 
Han vital," "duration, "and "becoming," which fly 
from mouth to mouth and are easily understood. 
The philosophy is a crusade against both intellectual- 
ism and naturalism. It puts aside, or makes second- 
ary, the processes of deduction and induction, and 
proposes a new method whose organ is intuition and 
whose purpose is to place us in immediate contact 
with life with the 6lan vital. Movement, becom- 
ing, is of the essence of this act; and as time has 
turned into a spatialized concept, Bergson substitutes 
duration for it. Creation is original, continuing, and 
incalculable. 

It may be interesting to trace a little the genesis 
of this new philosophy. Again there is a reminder 
of Darwinism. As Lamarck, St. Hilaire, Goethe, 
the elder Darwin, and Tennyson put forth Darwin- 
ian ideas before the theory was formulated, so Berg- 
sonism has been in the air for a long time. The 
first anticipatory statement, as far as I know, of 
Bergson's method is in the opening pages of Poe's 
"Eureka." It is very thoroughgoing, and consists 
of a denunciation of the rival methods of deduction 
and induction in their boastful claims to be the sole 
roads to truth, and the suggestion of a third process, 
intuition, as a short cut across the fields. Poe's 
weighty and acutely reasoned pages are marked 
with a show of burlesque and persiflage which has 
perhaps kept the philosophic thought in them from 
being recognized. Here is a sentence describing the 
effort to attain intuition, which might almost have 
leaped out of one of Bergson's books : " It seems to 
me that we require something like a mental gyration 
on the heel. We need so rapid a revolution of all 
things about the point of sight, that while the minutiae 
vanish altogether, even the more conspicuous objects 
blend into one." But Poe was a poet, and thought

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



in images, so he turned from the metaphysical de- 
velopment of his method and attacked the problem 
of the universe from the physical side. Cardinal 
Newman's "illative sense," the faculty which 
recognizes propositions before they are stated and 
resolves problems without logic, is only intuition 
under another name. Schopenhauer's Will, under 
some of its aspects, resembles intuition, and his con- 
stant preoccupation all his life with the problem of 
genius shows a bent towards an intuitional doctrine. 
Nietzsche's valuable illumination of the Greek 
Dionysian myth is a step in the same direction. 
Von Hartmann's "Philosophy of the Unconscious" 
is a genuine basis for the new method. It has not 
escaped attention, of course, that Bergson is expound- 
ing and expanding the doctrine of Heraclitus, 
he who said "you cannot go down into the same 
river twice," the prophet of Becoming. There are 
points of contact with Plotinus and with the Vedanta 
philosophers of India. But Bergson has not only 
gathered up all these threads of thoughts, he has 
supplied a vast deal more. He has made the theory 
his own as much as Darwin made his, and what is 
better he has exhibited it with so much grace of style 
and richness of illustration that the general reader 
may be tempted for once to say with Milton, 
" How charming is divine philosophy, 
Not harsh and rugged as dull fools suppose, 
But a perpetual feast of nectared sweets 
Where no crude surfeit reigns." 

But is Bergson's philosophy true ? In the ver- 
nacular, " will it wash " ? Well, the critics have 
already begun their work on it. Like most sys- 
tems, it is a strong fortress hanging in air. If we 
can only win to it we shall be safe. But it re- 
quires a leap. It requires as strong an act of faith 
as Kant calls for after he had broken down the 
bridge between the phenomenal and the noumenal. 
Yet it is unquestionably true that life is more than 
mind, more than the concepts of that mind, more 
than the language in which those concepts are 
couched. We ought to be able to place ourselves 
in immediate contact with the eternal duration, the 
continuing creation, the elan vital. But the trouble 
is, if we do so we have no means of communicating 
the fact to others. Intelligible communication can 
only take effect by means of concepts and language. 
We might each one of us become isolated like a 
Dancing Dervish in our own ecstasy. Perhaps if 
we transcend sensations, concepts, the unit of apper- 
ception, the final self, we may not even know we 
are in ecstasy. 

But in spite of Bergson's very effective criticism 
of intellectualism and naturalism, he does not really 
want to prorogue or abolish those ever hostile but 
still confederated powers of existence. He simply 
wants to introduce a third force which will vitalize 
them. Every religious enthusiast, every poet, every 
artist knows that this force call it intuition, in- 
spiration, or intoxication is the thing that he must 
rely on for the best that he can do. It is the some- 
thing not himself, which, after he has labored and 



struggled and assembled his materials, comes in a 
flash as it were and makes his work valuable. The 
minds of poets have more than any others been the 
paths for this unearthly influence. The " divine 
phrensy," the " divine fire," have always been terms 
applied to these seizures. The Greeks in their Diony- 
sian myth tried to give a wider effect to this power 
by a cult of intoxication. 

The chief value of the Bergsonian philosophy 
seems to me to be the liberating of the human mind 
in this direction. It is a justification of religion, 
poetry, art, all the imaginative and emotional pro- 
ducts of our nature. These have been in danger 
of being killed off by the general acceptance of 
mechanical naturalism. If, as in India, the gods 
come back, they will bring with them all the fresh 
warm feelings and great imaginations from which 
spring poetry and the arts. There will be 
" One common wave of hope and joy 
Lifting mankind again." 

In speaking above of Poe's contribution to the 
new method of knowledge, I have used the phrase 
" a short cut across the fields." In a great measure 
that is what Bergson's philosophy really is. He 
invites us to leave the too stony, dusty roads of in- 
tellectualism and naturalism and follow him across 
country. The grass is springy beneath us, flowers 
bloom around, the air is fresh and sweet, we come 
into the shade of trees and seat ourselves by living 
fountains. It is a delightful adventure. Perhaps our 
short cut will not lead us to the City of Truth, but 
certainly neither of the two great highways which 
mankind has tramped for so many centuries seems 
to have done that. We cannot be worse off than we 
were, and we may gain much delight by the way. 
Perhaps if we can keep in sight of the old routes we 
may combine all their advantages at once.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



A LIBRARY MOVEMENT IN BARODA which promises 

to quicken the hitherto sluggish library activity of all 
India starts with the formation of a Baroda Library 
Club (twenty-five charter members) and the estab- 
lishing of a "Library Miscellany," or quarterly peri- 
odical devoted to public-library interests in Baroda 
and in India generally. Mr. J. S. Kudalkar, editor 
of the magazine, was called from America two years 
ago by the Maharaja Gaikwad, pioneer of the mod- 
ern library movement in India, to do for that coun- 
try, as far as possible, what has already been done 
for this in the founding of free libraries for the 
people. The first number of the "Miscellany" has 
reached us, and proves to be a highly interesting and 
enterprising publication, its three sections (English, 
Gujarati, and Marathi) being devoted to library 
matters both domestic and foreign, especially to 
the bibliothecal renaissance or perhaps naissance 
would be the better term now receiving attention 
and encouragement in India. An elaborate "Scheme

of Classification for Sanskrit Libraries " is given, in 
which the grand divisions of literature are designated 
by vowels, gutterals, palatals, cerebrals, dentals, semi- 
vowels, and sibilants, including the aspirate. This 
may remind one of the new classification adopted 
by our Library of Congress, a classification in 
which the letters of the alphabet play the chief role, 
with numbers as subordinates. Not all classifiers, 
it is evident, see literature in decimally-divided sec- 
tions. The best wishes of American library workers 
go out to Mr. Kudalkar, to the Maharaja Gaikwad 
who is supporting him, and to all other participants 
in the movement to place books in the hands of the 
toiling millions of India. 



THE POET'S EMOTIONS IN THE FACE OF IMPEND- 
ING DEATH ought not to be unworthy of record 
when that poet happens to be one of the greatest of 
his time, if not of all time. In Mr. Edmund Gosse's 
reminiscent article, "Swinburne at Etretat," in the 
October "Cornhill," he relates the poet's bathing ad- 
venture that nearly cost him his life, in the late sum- 
mer of 1868. The timely appearance of a fishing 
smack on the scene prevented the premature silen- 
cing of the voice that was presently to entrance the 
world (or some part of it) with the "Songs before 
Sunrise." " I asked him," writes Mr. Gosse, "what 
he thought about in that dreadful contingency, and 
he replied that he had no experience of what peo- 
ple often profess to witness, the concentrated pano- 
rama of past life hurrying across the memory. He 
did not reflect, on the past at all. He was filled 
with annoyance that he had not finished his ' Songs 
before Sunrise,' and then with satisfaction that 
so much of it was ready for the press, and that 
Mazzini would be pleased with him. And then he 
continued: 'I reflected with resignation that I was 
exactly the same age as Shelley was when he 
was drowned.' (This, however, was not the case; 
Swinburne had reached that age in March, 1867; 
but this was part of a curious delusion of Swin- 
burne's that he was younger by two or three years 
than his real age.) Then, when he began to be, 
I suppose, a little benumbed by the water, his 
thoughts fixed on the clothes he had left on the 
beach, and he worried his clouded brain about some 
unfinished verses in the pocket of his coat." So 
here again we have an instance of the failure of an 
actor in a real-life drama to rise to the dramatic 
possibilities of his part. They do these things better 
in fiction. 

A SUMPTUOUS BOOK CATALOGUE, which collectors 
will undoubtedly preserve for its own sake, quite 
apart from the interest of the items which it records, 
is that of '-two hundred extraordinarily important 
books, manuscripts, and autograph letters" offered 
for sale by Messrs. Pearson of London. It is a 
beautifully-printed quarto, whose many illustrations, 
facsimiles, and detailed descriptions, increase one's 
desire to see and handle and own some of the liter- 



ary curiosities enumerated. For mere costliness, the 
first place in the collection is held by the copy of 
the " Antiphonary " supposed to have been presented 
by Francis I. to Henry VIII. on the Field of the 
Cloth of Gold. It is a splendid manuscript with 
beautiful miniatures attributed to Fra Benedetto, 
and is encased in what "is believed to be the finest 
Renaissance binding in the world," the work of 
Roffet. It is yours for three thousand pounds ster- 
ling. A more modest appeal is made by Lamb's 
"John Woodvil: A Tragedy," first edition, original 
boards, uncut, and offered at sixty-three pounds. 
Especial curiosity is excited by the description of a 
letter from Lady Hamilton to George IV. (then 
Prince of Wales) after Trafalgar, with a lock of 
Nelson's hair. Letter and hair await purchase 
at six hundred pounds. The Burbage portrait of 
Shakespeare, "in its original pure and untouched 
state," is ready to be hung over your study table as 
soon as you choose to send Mr. Pearson the six hun- 
dred and fifty pounds named as the price. But if 
you haven't that amount at hand just now, perhaps 
a copy of La Fontaine's "Fables Choisies," first edi- 
tion, quarto, with numerous vignettes by Chauveau, 
bound in red morocco, and costing only seventy-five 
pounds, would better agree with the state of your 
bank account. 

STEVENSON'S CONCEPTION OF REALISM is illus- 
trated by a passage in an overlooked Vailima letter 
recently discovered by Sir Sidney Colvin while he 
was overhauling his desks and cabinets in prepara- 
tion for a change of residence. This letter and 
other Stevensoniana unearthed at the same time 
form the subject of an article from the discoverer's 
pen in the November "Scribner." After referring 
to certain vexatious delays in the making of the 
final draft of " David Balfour," Stevenson writes : 
" At the same time, though I love my Davy, I am 
a little anxious to get on again on The Young Che- 
valier. I have in nearly all my works been trying 
one racket : to get out the facts of life as clean and 
naked and sharp as I could manage it. In this other 
book I want to try and megilp them altogether in 
an atmosphere of sentiment, and I wonder whether 
twenty-five years of life spent in trying this one will 
not make it impossible for me to succeed in the other. 
However, it is the only way to attempt a love story. 
You can't tell any of the facts, and the only chance 
is to paint an atmosphere." And yet who would 
ever think of going to Stevenson's romances (those 
in which he had been " trying one racket ") for the 
facts of life, " clean and naked and sharp " ? 

A PROPOSED LIBRARY OF PECULIAR CHARACTER 

forms the subject of a recent interesting newspaper 
communication from Leipzig. Everyone familiar 
with that centre of German book-publishing knows 
about the Book-Industry Museum, with its Guten- 
berg statue in front, and, inside, its collection of 
examples of printing in different ages, and its illus-

trations of all the various processes connected with 
the making of books. But this museum, famous and 
well worth visiting though it is, does not satisfy 
the booksellers and the printers and publishers of 
Leipzig, who apparently desire a more modernly- 
equipped institution to signalize the triumphs of 
present-day book-manufacture in Germany. There- 
fore they have urged, with success, the founding of 
a library that shall contain a copy of every printed 
work of German make from the first day of January, 
1913, onward. The city has granted land for the 
new building, which will be a costly structure but 
exactly how it is to be paid for does not appear 
and the expense of maintenance will be defrayed 
by the kingdom of Saxony and the city of Leipzig. 
The public use of so exclusively modern a library 
will be small at first, but with the lapse of time this 
rawness of youth will give place to mellowness and 
maturity ; and one need not be a great prophet to pre- 
dict a comparatively early congestion of its shelves, 
so rapid is the present rate of book-publication in 
Germany, as elsewhere. Even the Royal Library 
at Berlin, with its fourteen hundred thousand vol- 
umes, is likely to be outstripped, in this matter of 
size of book-collection, before many years. 

THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF LOAFING, especially to 
students, writers, and literary workers generally, 
must be urged now and then, even at the risk of 
encouraging laziness in those constitutionally ad- 
dicted to unemployment. Stevenson has said a 
good word on the fruitfulness of occasional idling, 
and Mark Twain's biographer has described that 
great writer's method of wooing the creative mood 
by waiting, in masterly inactivity, for the " inspira- 
tion tank" to fill up. The annual vacation season 
is now past, but it is not an unseasonable thing to 
lay plans for the summer that is coming. "Public 
Libraries " publishes, and also reprints as a special 
leaflet, Mr. Adam Strohm's Ottawa address on 
"Efficiency of the Library Staff and Scientific 
Management," in which, among other wise counsels, 
the granting of a generous annual vacation (of at 
least a month) to the library worker is eloquently 
urged "not so much because a faithful servant 
has earned a rest, but because without it life means 
living at a low level, with the certain result of 
deadening one's faculties, ambition and alertness, 
whereas these should all grow with one's experience 
and work." Dr. Luther H. Gulick is quoted as 
asserting that " growth is predominantly a function 
of rest," and that "the best work that most of us 
do is not in our office or at our desks, but when we 
are wandering in the woods, or sitting quietly with 
undirected thoughts." 

A ROSEATE VIEW OF TURKEY arrests the attention 
just now in the opening chapter of that deservedly 
popular book (recently translated from the German 
into the mother-tongue of its author), "The Founda- 
tions of the Nineteenth Century," by Mr. Houston 



Stewart Chamberlain. On page six of volume one 
he says : "While these lines are being written [1897], 
the civilised world is clamorously indignant with 
Turkey ; the European Powers are being compelled 
by the voice of public opinion to intervene for the 
protection of the Armenians and Cretans; the final 
destruction of the Turkish power seems now only a 
question of time. This is certainly justified; it was 
bound to come ; nevertheless it is a fact that Turkey 
is the last little corner of Europe in which a whole 
people lives in undisturbed prosperity and happiness. 
It knows nothing of social questions, of the bitter 
struggle for existence, and other such things ; great 
fortunes are unknown and pauperism is literally 
non-existent; all form a single harmonious family, 
and no one strives after wealth at the expense of his 
neighbor. I am not simply repeating what I have 
read in newspapers and books, I am testifying to 
what I have seen with my own eyes." And it is 
this peaceful Arcadia, this perfect Utopia, that now 
resounds with the clash of arms and the roar of 
artillery. . . . 

HlGH QUOTATIONS ON A YOUNG AUTHOR'S FIRST 

EDITIONS must send sensory waves of an agreeable 
warmth through the cardiac regions of that author. 
It is reported from London that certain early works 
of Mr. Kipling (who will not be displeased, we hope, 
if we consider him still young in years, as he un- 
deniably is in spirit) were recently sold at Sotheby's 
for $245 (in terms of American money) at the same 
time that Mr. Thomas Hardy's works, in thirty-eight 
volumes, first editions, brought $210; George Eliot's 
complete works, also first editions, $270; the volumi- 
nous G. P. R. James's, $127.50 ; and the rollicking 
Charles Lever's romances, $305. Among high prices 
for single books is to be noted the handsome figure 
reached by the original edition of " Alice in Wonder- 
land " with its forty-two Tenniel illustrations. This 
little nursery classic brought $125, and its first ap- 
pearance is still pleasurably remembered by those 
not yet old. ... 

THE GROWTH OF THE GOETHE MUSEUM AT 

WEIMAR testifies to the rapidity with which the 
great poet's works are selling in new editions and 
new translations, and the steady increase of litera- 
ture about him and his writings. The Goethe house 
has long served as a repository for Goethe relics 
and souvenirs of all sorts, including all the editions 
of his works and all the books written about him and 
his works. Consequently it is now found too small 
for the purposes of a museum of this sort, and an 
addition is to be built, modelled as closely as possi- 
ble after the smaller buildings that were unwisely 
demolished in 1890. They opened on the garden 
where the poet was wont to take his daily constitu- 
tional. Their replacement will illustrate anew the 
surprising rapidity with which libraries and museums 
almost invariably outgrow their quarters, however 
generous the allowance of space may seem to have 
been in the beginning.

HACKNEYED PHRASES. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Subscribers to THE DIAL, if they read no other than 
that worthy periodical, would scarcely be justified in 
writing to you for help against the almost universal and 
monotonously dreary repetition of hackneyed phrases. 
The more reason that you should use your authority in 
banishing such banal and senseless terms, if not from 
the language, at least from the pages of magazines and 
newspapers pretending to some degree of literary taste. 
It is possibly going too far to say that whenever a writer 
makes use of expressions like the following, he will have 
nothing of intellectual value to give to his reader. He 
may occasionally prove pleasantly disappointing, but 
the chances are that his message will be as worn out 
and dusty as the road of his mind from somewhere to 
nowhere. 

The detritus of language is also the veriest dust and 
mud of thought, and the ruts and hummocks of both wear 
more and worse with every tramp footfall. Experience 
has demonstrated that argument and reproof are wasted 
upon the reportorial mind and the editors of the Yellows, 
but could not something be done with the men " higher 
up"? 

From a list of many old sins by a multitude of sinners 
I now single out only a few illustrations: 

" Gathered together." Could there be more foolish 
and useless tautology? And yet it will be found re- 
peated many times in the pages of every number of 
most periodicals. Why not vary it with "collected 
together " ? And to make it more ridiculous why not 
the threefold "gathered and collected together," or, 
indeed, " gathered and collected together into a col- 
lection " ? May not the single word " gathered," or 
" collected " be made to serve? 

Worse, if possible, assuredly more certain to pop up, 
is the trite old "as a matter of fact." Facts and truths 
are always certain to mean little to the minds of those 
who make use of such a pompous phrase, and such repe- 
titions and attritions deceive only those who wear them 
out in the vain attempt to simulate judgment. Let us 
delete every word of the stodgy simulacrum, and go at 
once to state what is the matter and the fact. 

" Call attention " is another pretender. Better suited 
to the mental condition of the " caller " would be " bawl." 
A modest writer would of course say " ask," " invite," 
" request," etc. 

" It is to be hoped." One trusts that there may be 
an end made of this bit of stuckupishness, and of " met 
with," both of which one meets in every second page of 
the popular writer. "All right all right " has got into the 
theatre, and even illumines the murk of the " writerup."

A PROPOSED INSTITUTE OF BUSINESS AND 
AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Readers of THE DIAL will perhaps remember previ- 
ous articles by the present writer suggesting the estab- 
lishment of a Bibliographical Institute. The plan was 
rather an academic one, and concerned chiefly, if not 
exclusively, with the interests of men of learning. I 
have gradually, through stages that do not here need to 
be explained, come to understand that there is another 



world than that of abstract learning, that needs attention 
from bibliographers and librarians, namely, the world 
of affairs, of industry, of business. The needs of this 
world are only in part identical with that of the other, 
its needs are very largely in other directions. What the 
business man and manufacturer wants is information 
about facts, not about theories ; and facts are not always 
to be found in books. The following, therefore, is a 
development of my previous plans, better adapted, as I 
believe, to the needs of our everyday world. 

An Institute is needed for the organization of the collec- 
tion and imparting of exact and reliable information about 
facts and ideas. It is important that a means of communica- 
tion be established between those who seek and those who 
have to impart special information about new facts and ideas. 
In order to obtain exact and reliable information on any sub- 
ject it is necessary to know where such information is to be 
found, and what sources of information are most reliable. 
The proposed Institute would first of all collect information 
about available sources of information; it would prepare 
a directory of directories, a catalogue of catalogues, a list of 
addresses of workers and investigators, a guide to special 
collections of written and printed material, of specimens and 
models, as well as to the expert special knowledge not yet 
public property. The Institute would offer its services to 
organize bibliographical and index work, much of which is 
now done by isolated agencies and individuals, resulting in 
duplication and waste without making all the existing knowl- 
edge available. It would also undertake research and index 
work that does not come within the field of any other agency. 
The Institute would, in a word, be a clearing house of ideas 
and an organizer of research. Many problems of today, that 
seem new to us, are really not new at all ; we often find in old 
books and magazines important information about matters 
and methods that were once in vogue, but are now forgotten, 
and which might aid in solving problems that have just come 
to the surface. For instance, farming with dynamite, which 
now is written up in this country as an entirely new thing, has 
been practiced in Germany for several years. When a new 
idea like that of scientific management is presented, or a 
new discovery made, such as the X-rays, the Institute would 
collect information in regard to similar ideas of older date, or 
other discoveries that have led up to the one that at the mo- 
ment fills the public mind. In the present scarcity of meat 
a new problem seems to confront the whole world ; here it 
might be the function of the Institute to search for informa- 
tion about earlier or more recent problems of similar char- 
acter, in order to find out how they were met, or how they 
solved themselves. Every day someone wants to find out 
where certain kinds of information may be found ; for 
instance : Where is the most complete collection of statisti- 
cal material about the resources and business possibilities of 
South America? Where has the problem of vocational edu- 
cation which just now has been brought before us by Mr. 
Cooley, been most satisfactorily solved ? What is the Raif- 
feisen system, and can it be adopted in this country ? How 
might the rural free delivery best be utilized as an agency 
for the progress of the rural population ? These and other 
questions that press forward for solution cannot be answered 
by an isolated institution, however munificently endowed; 
the world's knowledge is not collected in one spot, it is scat- 
tered all over the world and must be searched for all over the 
world. The Institute would therefore establish close relations 
with other institutions of similar nature in other countries, 
and direct connections with the large libraries, museums, 
schools, and learned societies and institutions of the world. 
The proposed Institute would supplement the work of the 
libraries and museums. The latter collect and preserve the 
materials of research, catalogue them, and hold them avail- 
able for investigators. The Institute would go one step 
further, prepare the material for use, and even indicate its 
probable value for the purpose of the inquirer. It would act 
as an intermediary between the investigator and his material.

RECOLLECTIONS OF L.OTJIS XAPOLEON.* 

" The late Baron d'Ambe"s," who figures as the 
author of these " Intimate Memoirs of Napoleon 
III.," seems to have been in close touch with 
Louis Napoleon for the larger part of the latter's 
life. It is not quite true, as he cries out in a 
burst of grief at the unfortunate ruler's death, 
that Louis was " the playmate of his childhood," 
since they met for the first time in Switzerland 
in 1833 ; but the ardent enthusiasm of disciple- 
ship which Louis possessed the strange power 
of exciting seized this young man of twenty and 
was never cast off entirely, though with the last 
years he was only the devoted friend and ad- 
mirer, no longer the blind and confident follower. 

Baron d'Amb^s helped to organize the at- 
tempted revolution from Strassburg in 1836. 
He was on hand when Louis made an effort to 
enter France by way of Boulogne, in 1840. He 
followed his friend on his campaign in Italy, 
always unofficially, and thought of joining the 
expedition to China, in 1860, but was restrained 
by meeting one day, at the turning of a street, 
" an extraordinary being, yellow, hideous, with 
a bony face and wicked little eyes." He said 
to himself: "No, I won't cross the sea to go 
where such folks live." It is to be feared that 
his friendship was not worth as much to the 
Emperor as he himself imagined. While other 
supporters of the Pretender suffered imprison- 
ment and persecution, he himself seems never 
to have been in the slightest danger or even to 
have attracted a great deal of attention. He 
proudly notes the phrase "Paladin of discre- 
tion" which his master applied to him, but there 
is no evidence that this discretion was ever put 
to any particularly severe test. To d'Ambe's, 
distrust of the coup d'etat was indisputable 
evidence of alliance with "forces of revolt and 
anarchy"; Victor Emmanuel and Cavour were 
not patriots, but only "Foxy and Company," 
scheming to make trouble for France ; the Jews 
were "stinking vermin everyone would extermi- 
nate if possible"; Vichy, like China, was a tire- 
some place where "I shan't come again . . . 
deeply attached to the Prince as I am"; and 
Morny was the object of apparently unmixed 
envy because he "gave himself up madly to 
love, gambling and drinking." Amiable and

witty and often exceedingly shrewd d'Ambes 
undoubtedly was, but scarcely a " Paladin of dis- 
cretion." On one occasion when he reproached 
Louis for not having confided in him, the Em- 
peror replied, " But, my friend, I remembered 
that you were writing your memoirs." 

The first chapter is a labored attempt to prove 
that Napoleon I. was the father of Napoleon III. 
The subject is not of a sort that Anglo-Saxons 
choose to discuss freely ; but a review of the evi- 
dence shows rather conclusively that Napoleon 
III. was not the son of Louis Bonaparte, though 
it fails utterly to prove that he was the son of 
the first Napoleon. This discussion is redeemed 
from idle scandal-mongering by the concluding 
sentence: "Be this as it may, Napoleon III. is 
certainly, above all morally, of the race of the 
great Corsican whose life-work he has striven to 
emulate, both in his acts and in his aspirations." 
With all his faults and failures, Louis exercised 
an influence and accomplished a result that set 
him immediately below his marvellous uncle, 
and leagues away from the other irresponsible 
weaklings who bore the name of Napoleon. 

If it be true that youthful inclinations indi- 
cate a divine purpose, Louis was providentially 
intended for a ruler. He himself says that he 
felt his destiny from the age of seven. He had 
a hand in political affairs in every country his 
mother's wanderings dragged him into. In Italy, 
though he denied it himself later, he must have 
been a Carbonaro. At least his elder brother 
was, and d'Ambes asserts that the latter's sud- 
den death was due not to the measles, but to 
the stiletto of a comrade when pressure from his 
family made him incline to defection. It was 
this early Italian complication which helped 
determine the Emperor's half-hearted interfer- 
ence with Austria and Naples, an interference 
which made him only enemies, and which played 
its part in his final downfall. 

" My uncle,'' Louis said to Thierry in 1838, 
" was Caesar. I will be Augustus." And when 
sentenced to perpetual confinement at Ham, he 
remarked quietly that the word " perpetual " 
was not in the French language. Entering 
Paris eight years later, after the outbreak of 
February, 1848, he passed a barricade, the stones 
of which some passers-by were restoring to their 
proper positions in the pavement. " Come, young 
man," said a woman to the new arrival, " help 
us put back the paving-stones in place." " My 
good woman," Louis replied, " that is precisely 
what I have come to Paris for." His lieutenant 
is quite as confident. At their first interview in 
Switzerland, the Prince chanced to remark, as

they strolled past a bank of hortensias, " I love 
the flowers beyond measure. They have about 
them something royal," " Imperial," d'Ambes 
put in softly. 

Louis's belief in his own destiny, however, 
did not prevent his frequent use of clever tricks. 
It is difficult to generalize with regard to this 
puzzling and contradictory character, but it may 
safely be said that at least during the early part 
of his career he was a consummately skilful 
demagogue. His " police de poche," the little 
notebook full of data with regard to the local 
dignitaries he was to meet on his popular tours, 
to be used in charming them by showing them 
how famous they were and by his sympathetic 
interest in their personal affairs, won him thou- 
sands of votes. But there is no question that 
Louis had a good heart and a brain fertile in 
expedients for making the lot of the common 
people easier. Mr. F. A. Simpson's luminous 
work on " The Rise of Louis Napoleon " gave 
us the completest study in English of his early 
labors in this direction, and the Baron d'Ambes 
touches lovingly on various evidences of a 
thought for the comfort of the many which 
could not always have been selfishly prompted. 
Defeated, broken, and dying at Chislehurst, he 
yet busied himself with plans for utilizing the 
heat from the lower floors of the great European 
tenement houses the floors occupied by the 
wealthy to warm the rooms above where the 
poorer families lived. 

The Empress does not appear to great advan- 
tage in these pages. D'Ambes stamps as calum- 
nies the attacks upon her character which were 
made before her marriage, but he is sure that 
notwithstanding her charms and her family's 
enterprise she would never have been Empress 
if Napoleon had not been refused beforehand 
by half the royal princesses of Europe ; and 
he ascribes the larger part of the blame for the 
successive acts of interference in foreign affairs, 
which pushed Napoleon and the Empire further 
and further toward the edge of the precipice, 
to her bigoted Catholicism and her meddling 
vanity. " L'Empire, c'est la paix," it is true, 
but how much of a safeguard is that, when 
" L'Imperatrice, c'est la guerre " ? 

The last fifty pages of the book, those deal- 
ing with the Prussian War and the fall of the 
Empire, are of thrilling and poignant interest. 
D'Ambes saw the end long before it came, and 
he had taken Bismarck's measure the moment 
that man of blood and iron appeared above the 
horizon. "It is often a great help to matters 
for a statesman " (this was written in January, 



1870) "to possess qualities the most widely at 
variance with the temperament of the nation 
that he governs." Was not that the secret of 
Bismarck's power and success ? Was he not the 
most violent and independent of men, working 
with the most quiet and docile of national ma- 
terial? Bismarck could never have done his 
work with Frenchmen, or even with English- 
men ; Prussia would have been long in taking 
the first rank among nations without Bismarck. 
Such flashes of insight as this redeem many 
pages of purposeless detail or frivolity. 

Napoleon is not even distantly related to many 
sections of the diary. " There is a man Zola who 
has taken up Manet's defense." " Everybody is 
reading and talking over Victor Hugo's Les 
Miserables. It is a gigantic success." " Scribe 
is not dead. He lives again in M. Victorien 
Sardou. . . . This Sardou is only thirty, and 
bids fair to command success." Such are some 
of the entries. Extending from 1838 to 1873, 
the notes touch the fascinating social and intel- 
lectual life of Paris at a thousand different 
points. The Baron was still alive to write an 
introduction to the present work in July, 1893. 
It is a pity that he did not continue his memoirs 
up to that time. Roy TEMPLE HOUSE. 



THE HUMBLE-BEE AS A HOBBY-HORSE.* 



" We gave up Euclid and the Rule of Three 
And nature- studied the Bumble-Bee." Punch. 

The Bee has been discussed by innumerable 
writers for the last two thousand years and 
more ; it is the subject of every kind of disser- 
tation, even of numerous jokes. One of these 
latter, which has been a favorite with the news- 
papers, relates how a young person of the city, 
visiting in the country, observed honey upon 
the breakfast table. "I see you keep a bee," 
was the innocent remark. People who smile at 
this seem no less funny to the entomologist when 
they let the fact escape that they imagine there 
is only one kind of bee. The bee, so-called, is in 
fact only one of many thousand species, and the 
most learned work on honey-bees no more than 
introduces us to the study of bees in general. 
It may even be objected that such a work be- 
gins at the wrong end of the subject, and that 
to really understand the socialism of the higher 
bees we must trace its evolution from the indi- 
vidualism of the primitive kinds.

[Nov. 16, 



Mr. Sladen's work, now before us, does not 
do this, but it does give us an excellent picture 
of the life and habits of the humble-bee, which 
in some respects stands just below the hive-bee 
in social rank. Mr. Sladen is a well-known 
expert on honey-bees, and it is from this interest 
that he has been led to consider bees in general, 
and to attempt the domestication and careful 
study of humble-bees. He has been abundantly 
repaid for his trouble, and has succeeded in 
describing his observations so well that many 
readers will share his pleasure, while some will 
doubtless attempt similar work of their own. 
The book is full of remarkable new observa- 
tions, and is a "nature book" of the best type. 
The illustrations are original and very good, 
both drawings and colored plates. It is a dis- 
advantage that the bees described are British 
species, all different from those found in this 
country; but even this is not altogether to be 
regretted. The general discussion will no doubt 
apply almost equally well on both sides of the 
world, while the treatment of the European 
kinds may serve as a model for similar work 
in this country, leaving the student to make his 
own original observations, following a carefully 
worked-out plan. 

If any fault is found with Mr. Sladen, it 
will probably be on the ground that he permits 
himself a certain Maeterlinckian freedom of 
expression which will not please the modern 
school of experts on animal behavior. Thus he 
tells us how Psithyrus, the usurper-bee, invades 
the nest of the humble-bee, slays the proper 
queen, and establishing herself as the ruler of 
the house, has her offspring brought up by the 
humble-bee workers. All this is accurately 
described, with many new details ; but we are 
assured that when the Psithyrus settled in the 
humble-bee nest, the poor humble-bee queen 
"was visibly depressed and ill at ease." "As 
time went on she grew nervous and languid, 
and showed increasing fear and suspicion of the 
unwelcome guest." Finally, on the tenth day 
after the first appearance of the Psithyrus, the 
humble-bee queen and three workers were found 
lying dead outside the nest. "Evidently the 
three workers had sacrificed their lives in a futile 
attempt to destroy their mother's murderess." 
Personally, I do not object to this sort of thing, 
as long as the writer is careful to describe ap- 
pearances, and we are careful to remember that 
every word must not be taken literally. As a 
matter of fact, literature is necessarily full of 
expressions which, while inaccurate perhaps if 
judged by the actual meaning of the words, 



nevertheless convey a vivid idea of what really 
took place. It would not help us much, from 
any point of view, to state instead that the pres- 
ence of the Psithyrus inhibited the normal activ- 
ities of the humble-bee, and led to the exhibition 
of imperfectly coordinated motor reactions. 

Wherever there are boys (young boys or old 
boys) who like to get the most out of nature in 
the long summer days, Mr. Sladen's book ought 
to be available. It should be put in libraries 
as a sort of bait for budding naturalists. Not all 
will bite, of course, but if one or two in a town 
come to admire and watch humble-bees instead 
of persecuting them, the thing is worth while. 
And who knows what ability, even genius, may 
somewhere be stimulated in just this way?

A NEW STUDY OF AMERICAN TRAITS.* 

When one has examined a number of books 
on America written by foreigners by every 
manner of visitor from England and France and 
Germany and Italy, and when one has turned 
in despair to the interpretations by our own 
journalists, politicians, and college professors, 
one is inclined to the conclusion that the Land 
of Opportunity has not yet been discovered. 
Putting our faith in minute inspection, we peer 
through spy-glass or microscope, but to no avail : 
our vision, bright for a moment, is soon blurred. 
Or we speed through the country on twentieth- 
century railway trains, in the hope that the 
moving picture will record the salient features 
of our continental nation and finally yield a 
faithful composite reproduction. Or we inquire 
whether art, that interprete lingua, has not re- 
vealed the great pulsing heart of America with 
such coy subtlety that she has eluded all our 
predecessors in the quest. But to no purpose do 
we open our eyes, or shut them, or gaze through 
them half -closed ; we are wellnigh as far from 
clear knowledge as were those first bold immi- 
grants, Captain John Smith and William Brad- 
ford. 

America, then, is yet to be discovered; and it 
would be too much to say that Professor Perry, 
the latest adventurer, has succeeded in landing 
on the coveted shores. Yet he is closer than all, 
or nearly all, who have tried before : one derives 
from his little book a sense of intimacy with 
American life and of truth of interpretation 
nowhere else to be had, no other writer has

manifested in so great degree mellow experience 
and broad knowledge lightly held. The chapters 
(originally lectures) are graceful, thoughtful, 
concrete; incident, example, and apt quotation 
are always at hand ; humor, an urbane affection- 
ate humor, enables the writer to delight while 
instructing as the sober pseudo-classicists 
would have put it. Fluid yet sure in thought, 
and constantly engaging in style, the book 
tempts one to read with uncritical haste ; at the 
risk, as Emerson said of Milton's prose, that we 
shall become "fatigued with admiration." 

Whoever would read hastily, or think hastily, 
should ponder long over the first of these lectures, 
on "Race, Nation, and Book." in which Profes- 
sor Perry clears the ground with the thorough- 
ness, and without the excessive assurance, of the 
American pioneer. In particular, our dogmatic 
foreign critics friends or enemies, they are 
nearly all dogmatic would do well to read this 
chapter at intervals while they travel in the 
United States or think us over as they lie in their 
deck chairs homeward bound. The dangers one 
encounters in generalizing about a race or a 
nation have often been pointed out since the 
pleasant days of determinism, but no one has 
indicated so clearly the unique insecurity in 
generalization concerning the American people. 
The second chapter, "The American Mind," is 
a discussion, rather briefer than one would like, 
of American traits, our alertness, excitability, 
versatility, curiosity, over-confidence, energy, 
idealism, radicalism in our brains and conser- 
vatism in our blood, our individualism and our 
public spirit. The most valuable part of the book 
follows. "Humor and Satire" maintains more 
persuasively than has ever been maintained be- 
fore the idea that American humor is hardly a 
thing sui generis, but rather the application of 
the common fund of humor to American condi- 
tions of life. The remaining three chapters, per- 
haps the most notable in the book, are devoted 
to " American Idealism," "Romance and Reac- 
tion," and "Individualism and Fellowship," 
phases of American spiritual qualities. 

Spiritual qualities have often been denied us, 
on the assumption that the dollar and the sky- 
scraper are the only symbols of America that 
must be reckoned with. Carlyle was loath to 
lecture in this country because he thought of it 
as "mainly a new Commercial England, with a 
fuller pantry." What more is to be expected 
of a huge democracy, a " government of the 
worst," as it was sometimes called in Federal- 
ist days ? The dispassionate critical sense of 
Matthew Arnold brought him to the conclusion 



that a great democracy is almost sure to be lack- 
ing in elevation. Emerson, looking for heroes, 
for surpassing fruit where the soil is so rich, 
found us running " to leaves, to suckers, to ten- 
drils, to miscellany." It is still feared that 
democracy is a cult of incompetence, that an 
equalitarian social organization involves medi- 
ocrity ; and it is conventional, in an increasing 
degree, to deplore our instinct for money-getting 
and our unthinking lust for " quick returns." 
Yet this expanding, restless, mysterious nation 
has really been, as Professor Perry remarks, 
" the home of idealism," from the beginning 
onward. From the day when elect Puritans 
enjoyed "the Rapturous praelibations of the 
Heavenly World" to our own day of trust in 
the unlimited possibilities of democracy, spirit- 
ual America has been as vivacious as material 
America. Among the writers of books alone, 
the Mathers in the seventeenth century, Ed- 
wards in the eighteenth, and Emerson in the 
nineteenth are nobly representative of our inner 
life. How pervasive idealism has been in this 
country no one has pointed out so fully and buoy- 
antly as Professor Perry in these three chapters. 
His view is hopeful our defects impress him 
but slightly and yet is so clear-sighted that 
only the cynic will fail to share his hope. " In- 
dividualism and Fellowship," the closing chap- 
ter, is the most interesting in the book, opening 
up as it does an endless vista for our dreams 
and speculations. Fellowship may mean nothing 
better than a " Samaritan Soup and Blanket 
Society"; it is often narrow, fanatical, or silly; 
but it must not be forgotten that individualism 
also had absurd excesses, that it was not only 
an age of mighty heroes but also "... the age 
of oddities let loose." The centrifugal always 
fascinates. If, then, the new era of cooper- 
ation is tending, as one must think, to senti- 
mentalism and mechanical organization rather 
than genuine fellowship, we have good reason 
to believe that we shall see another and more 
estimable tendency as the years go on. Perfect 
balance is one of the rarest of human qualities ; 
but it is not for us to deny that the future will 
witness that interplay of fellowship and individ- 
ualism that is now our largest hope.

MATHEMATICO-PROCRUSTEAN ART.* 

It is unquestionably the fact that symmetry 
and regularity are attributes frequently found 
associated with the beautiful in nature and in 
art. Whether such association, however, is uni- 
versal and invariable is open to question. Still 
more debatable is the contention that such rela- 
tionship is of a sort which may properly be 
termed causal. Are objects beautiful primarily 
because they are symmetrical and regular in their 
tectonic ? If the reviewer correctly understands 
the essential argument of the somewhat obscure 
book called " Nature's Harmonic Unity : A 
Treatise on its Relation to Proportional Form," 
by Mr. Samuel Colman, that author intends to 
maintain as his primary thesis that the beautiful 
is necessarily geometric, and as a corollary that 
the geometric must perforce be beautiful. Now 
these contentions may be true, but the reviewer 
has very grave doubts about the matter. The 
fundamental difficulty in the case lies in what 
would certainly seem to be the fact, that if these 
ideas were true it ought to be possible for a rea- 
sonably ingenious person to invent a machine 
which, upon being supplied with an appropriate 
source of power, would proceed to turn out paint- 
ings with the appeal of the Sistine Madonna or 
the Night Watch, sculpture which would move 
mankind as does the Venus de Milo or the 
Winged Victory, music of the order of the Ride 
of the Valkyries, or poetry like Shelley's " To 
a Skylark." But somehow everyone knows, in- 
stinctively and surely, that this is a sheer im- 
possibility. Harmony and symmetry all these 
things certainly have. But just as certainly 
their harmony and symmetry is not something 
created primarily by the application of compass 
and ruler, and no amount of well-printed and 
illustrated mathematical argumentation is ever 
going to convince anybody that it is. Any dil- 
igent fool can manipulate a ruler and compass 
to produce geometrical symmetries and harmo- 
nies ; but if he supposes that by this activity 
solely he is going to create something which will 
make an enduring appeal to the aesthetic in- 
stincts of his fellow men, he has only to try it in 
a practical way in order to be undeceived. 

The method of Mr. Colman's book is to show 
by the most extraordinarily complicated dia- 
grams that a great many different objects found 
in nature or created by man display a more or 
less definite and harmonious proportionality of 
parts, and may be enclosed, by the exercise

of some force, within triangles or pentagons or 
concentric circles or some other geometric figure. 
The examples chosen to illustrate this really 
profound but not altogether novel discovery are 
numerous and diverse. In their diversity kirks 
the element of deliciously unintentional humor 
which classifies this book with the lucubrations 
of other geometrical philosophers who have pre- 
ceded our author. Thus we are shown (p. 112) 
that a peanut and the Parthenon are planned on 
the same " ideal angle." In the Hermes of 
Praxiteles and the mollusc Haliotis " the pen- 
tagon is strongly in evidence." And so on in- 
definitely : snow crystals and saint's chapels, 
peacocks and palaces, milkweeds and mosques, 
pine cones and porticos, all these things and 
many more are geometrically Procrustified in 
the course of the argument. One is moved to 
wonder whether it might not be wise to prescribe 
the thorough study of the adventures of Alice 
as a fundamental part of all elementary mathe- 
matical training. It would certainly have the 
good effect, as Septimus said, of tending to 
" keep one human." 

The artist, and particularly the architect, will 
certainly find this book interesting. There is 
a possibility that somebody may find it useful.

progress may, as far as we can see, continue into 
the indefinite future. But the ideal values that 
prosperity should embody, the values that should 
give real meaning to progress, appear to be wav- 
ering. Religion, personal and political integrity, 
family obligation, love of truth and beauty, self- 
control and honesty of endeavor those ideals and 
abstractions which are the only contributions of 
the past to present welfare that are of unimpeach- 
able worth are apparently undergoing important 
structural changes. Whether these changes repre- 
sent, on the whole, an advance, or whether they are 
signs of a degeneration which forebodes the ultimate 
downfall of western civilization, must be left to the 
constitutional optimists and pessimists to debate. 
Optimists and pessimists, however, must agree that 
our society suffers from maladies that if neglected 
will result in serious consequences. 

We are acquainted with the social reformers who 
hold that nothing short of a thoroughgoing trans- 
formation of our political and economic structure can 
bring relief. Other reformers, not less zealous, urge 
that even this could do little good. Men are poor, 
as a rule; but, as a rule, men are inefficient, self- 
indulgent, envious. As long as men are what they 
are, the most profound changes in social structure 
will leave the sources of misery uncontrolled. An 
improved human nature is evidently what we need. 
To improve the nature of the adult, however, seems 
a task beyond the power of the social reformer. 
Hence his attention turns to the child, and we have 
a flood of books designed to force upon the citizen a 
realization of the necessity of the conservation of 
the child. 

First in the order of urgency is the problem of 
the defective child. Among our public school chil- 
dren are tens of thousands who suffer from congeni- 
tal defect of understanding. They block the progress 
of the classes, yet profit nothing themselves. There 
are hundreds of thousands suffering from impaired 
hearing or eyesight, from under-nutrition or other 
remediable condition which, as matters stand, assimi- 
late them, for all practical purposes, with the con- 
genitally defective. It is the plain duty of society 
to segregate from the body of normal children all 
those that are abnormal, to provide adequate treat- 
ment for those suffering from remediable defects, 
' and to devise means for the training of those who 
are congenitally inferior. Adequate medical inspec- 
tion in the schools will perform the cruder work of 
segregation. To draw a distinction between the 
children whose mental deficiency is due to causes 
that are removable and those who suffer from incur- 
able mental taint is a difficult matter. The distinc- 
tion must, however, be drawn ; for it is obviously 
the duty of society to segregate, as far as possible, 
tainted stock, to prevent the transmission of the 
defect to the next generation. For this work of 
segregation we have need of the services of the psy- 
chologist, who can also give invaluable suggestions 
as to the training of those whose development has 
merely been retarded. Even the children who are 



incurably defective in mind may often be trained 
for useful and reasonably happy lives, provided the 
teacher can command the best methods that the psy- 
chological expert can devise. Students of education 
have long known of the wonderful work of this char- 
acter carried on at the University of Pennsylvania 
under Professor Lightner Witmer. We have now 
in Mr. Arthur Holmes's " The Conservation of the 
Child " an account of the work of the University of 
Pennsylvania psychological clinic. The book is a 
practical guide, specially adapted to the use of in- 
vestigators and teachers who wish to undertake a 
similar work. For such it is extremely rich in 
suggestions as to methods. The book contains also 
much that will interest the general reader who has 
awakened to the significance of the current eugenic 
movement. 

Important as are the problems of checking the 
transmission to future generations of hereditary men- 
tal taint, and of removing physical defects which tend 
to retard mental development, there is a problem of 
even greater immediate importance: the protection 
of the child against the degrading influences of en- 
vironment. Much of our j uvenile delinquency, much 
of the criminality of adult life, is traceable, not to 
physiological or psychological causes, but to the forces 
for evil that bear upon the neglected child in the city. 
What obstacles the children of the slums must over- 
come if they are to reach a plane of normal living we 
are beginning to understand. Miss Breckinridge 
and Miss Abbott give us, in "The Delinquent Child 
and the Home," a clearer insight into the condi- 
tions of the homes that produce delinquents. The 
book presents, to be sure, much evidence of delin- 
quency due to tainted heredity; but the main root 
of juvenile delinquency appears to be unfavorable 
environment, due to parental vice or ignorance, to 
poverty, or to the lack of adjustment to American 
urban conditions of a population of foreign or rural 
origin. The book is a general study of juvenile 
delinquency in Chicago, and is the most thorough 
and systematic study of its kind extant. It not only 
exhibits the causes of juvenile delinquency, but 
offers also abundant suggestions for practical re- 
form. Not the least important part of the book 
are the appendices, containing a very competent 
discussion of the legal problems involved in the 
juvenile court, an abstract of juvenile court laws, 
and "family paragraphs" relating to one hundred 
boys and fifty girls brought before the juvenile court 
for delinquencies. 

More potent than the disorder and neglect of the 
home, in producing delinquency and in arresting 
the "physical, mental, and moral development of our 
children, is their economic exploitation. Child labor 
in the factories has for almost a century received the 
condemnation of all men of intelligence and public 
spirit. The evil is still with us. As all American 
students know, progress in the direction of the aboli- 
tion of child labor is rendered difficult by the fact 
that the subject, in this country, is a matter of state 
legislation ; and each state fears to advance too far

[Nov. 16, 



beyond its neighbors. We are, however, advancing ; 
and little by little the more backward states imitate, 
in legislation, the measures of those bold enough to 
prefer the permanent welfare of their children to 
the transient prosperity of their industries. The 
present state of legislation in this field, throughout 
the United States, is set forth by Mr. W. F. Ogburn 
in his "Progress and Uniformity in Child Labor 
Legislation." Its somewhat forbidding style should 
not bar this work from the shelves of the student of 
the labor problem. It is a systematic study of com- 
parative child labor legislation. The age limit of 
each state, the exceptions to the rules of state law, 
the machinery of inspection, the penalties upon 
infractions of the law, are here placed before the 
reader in easily comprehended tables. The author 
hopes his study will be useful to legislators. It cer- 
tainly will be, if, as many believe, we are about to 
enter upon an era of expert legislation. 

While factory exploitation of child labor has been 
the subject of reforming agitation for three genera- 
tions, the exploitation of children in the manifold 
services of the city street has scarcely been noticed. 
We know comparatively little about the extent of 
employment of small children as newsboys, street 
vendors, bootblacks, etc. The effects of such em- 
ployment upon character receive little thought from 
the general public who are served by these children. 
Mr. Edward W. Clopper, in "Child Labor in the 
City Streets," shows that the number of children 
thus employed is enormous. He also emphasizes the 
fact, pointed out by other social investigators, that 
such employment is attended by grave dangers to 
society. The children of the streets furnish an ex- 
traordinarily large contingent to our army of juve- 
nile delinquents. 

For the child who has gone wrong, through the 
fault of his guardians, or in consequence of the ad- 
verse social and economic influences to which he is 
exposed, there formerly appeared to be little hope. 
Fortunately we have learned that the reform of the 
juvenile delinquent is far from a hopeless task. The 
bad boy of our city slums can be transformed into 
a useful and virtuous citizen, provided he receives 
the proper kind of treatment. The whole world has 
heard of the achievements of Mr. William R. George 
and his Junior Republic. It cannot hear too much 
about this great work, and will welcome " Citizens 
Made and Remade," written by Mr. Lyman Beecher 
Stowe, upon data furnished by Mr. George. 

The experience of Mr. George has given many 
of the suggestions for Professor Edgar J. Swift's 
" Youth and the Race." Professor Swift, however, 
is concerned primarily with the education of the nor- 
mal youth. He is a follower of the school of peda- 
gogy which sees in the life of the average person an 
abbreviated repetition of the life history of the race. 
Boyish nature, in this light, loses its inexplicable 
and irresponsible quality. Boyish sins are thrown 
back upon that modern representative of the prin- 
ciple of vicarious atonement, primitive man. We 
should recognize the atavistic character of the im- 



pulses of the child and utilize them in the great work 
of education. 

Like Professor Swift, Dr. William B. Forbush, 
in "The Coming Generation," is concerned pri- 
marily with the problems of the upbringing of the 
normal child. If Professor Swift's interpretation 
of youth is essentially anthropological, that of Dr. 
Forbush is essentially human. Dr. Forbush loves 
children boys especially. It is doubtful that he 
has even studied them scientifically. Possibly for 
this very reason, his knowledge of their nature is 
profound. His book should prove helpful both to 
parent and to teacher ; it is worth anyone's while 
to read it. It is difficult for the social reformer to 
enter the kingdom of pure literature ; and probably 
Dr. Forbush's work, in spite of its fine personal qual- 
ity, must be consigned to the realm of pedagogy. 

The problem of the proper care and training of 
our children is manifestly one of great complexity. 
The American public school system is, on the whole, 
an efficient one ; the American public school teachers 
are as a class devoted and intelligent. The schools 
are not, however, performing all the work we have 
a right to require from them. Moreover, the ser- 
vices of the teachers must be supplemented by the 
organized activities of many other social agencies. 
From papers presented at the conferences held dur- 
ing the Chicago Child Welfare Exhibit in May, 1911, 
now published under the title, "The Child in the 
City," both the teacher and the interested layman 
can gain much information as to the possibilities of 
child welfare work. The book contains an enormous 
mass of information concerning actual achievements 
in this field in the various cities of the country. As 
would naturally be expected, the material composing 
the volume is very uneven in quality. A number 
of the papers, however, are of such excellence as to 
make the volume an important contribution to the 
literature of social reform. 

There has probably never been a time when a 
larger proportion of the citizens of a state were 
willing to engage in the work of social amelioration 
than at present. Much of the social work undertaken 
by laymen, however, is lamentably ineffective. Who 
has not known of associations of public-spirited men 
or women, meeting regularly through months or even 
years, conducting an interminable correspondence, 
with a view to the accomplishment of some worthy 
but wholly trivial task ? The waste of philanthropic 
energies in our society must be incredibly great. If 
these energies could be controlled, and directed to 
the use of our children, many of our problems would 
solve themselves. Miss Elsa Denison's book on 
"Helping School Children" is essentially a manual 
designed to impart the technique of organizing the 
scattered philanthropic forces of society and of ap- 
plying them to the service of the child. The book is a 
marvel in its multiplicity of practical suggestions. No 
one to whom it is accessible will need to confess his 
inability to find important social service work to do. 

The pessimist will urge that it is easy to suggest 
work for children that needs to be done, the funda-

mental difficulty which we encounter is in finding 
men and women who are capable of doing the 
work. The truth would appear to be that we have, 
in our society, a host of men and women qualified 
by intelligence and sympathy to assist in the con- 
servation of the child. If they are inactive, it is 
because the general public does not recognize the 
worth of the work. Values are social. If the gen- 
eral public regards a certain function with indiffer- 
ence, the individual, however pure his motives and 
devoted his character, must lose the faith upon 
which effective action depends. The books under 
review, and others of their kind, are helping to 
create general interest in the problems of child 
welfare, and so are establishing the new values upon 
which, in the last analysis, the solution of these 
problems must depend. ALVIN S JOHNSON. 



RECENT FICTION.* 



The theme of the marital relation is one that the 
novelists find perennially interesting, and the com- 
plications that result from ill-assorted unions afford 
them endless opportunities for discussion. Writers 
of the older school were usually content with the 
development of a situation in which either husband 
or wife was obviously at fault. The wife was un- 
faithful or the husband was a brute, and he who ran 
might read the moral. There was always in the 
background, if not in the foreground, a contrasting 
ideal of marital felicity, which example was held up 
for the reproof of the offending hero or heroine. But 
our later novelists will have nothing so obvious, and 
it is their peculiar delight to devise a situation in 
which neither party does anything particularly wrong, 
and yet both are profoundly unhappy. Mr. H. G. 
Wells is one of the most ingenious of these exposi- 
tors, and his latest novel, entitled "Marriage" tout 
court, seems to us an elaborate illustration of much 
ado about nothing. His Marjorie is an extremely 
attractive young woman with a college education and 
a rather distressing family. She becomes engaged 
to a writer who is said to be a professional humorist, 
which fact we must take on faith, since none of his 
many recorded words for a moment suggests such a 
thing. He is described more accurately as covering 
every subject which interested him "with a large

enveloping shallowness." From the fate of such a 
union Marjorie is saved by a young student of mo- 
lecular physics who drops one day upon her lawn in 
a wrecked airship. Trafford knows his own mind 
and is plain-spoken ; the wooing is speedily followed 
by the wedding, and the skies seem unclouded. Un- 
fortunately, Marjorie soon involves the household in 
unanticipated expenses, for spending is her delight, 
and Trafford gives her carte blanche, although he 
knows that she has no idea of the value of money. 
The "society" bee also gets into her bonnet, and, 
to meet the increased demands upon him, Trafford 
gives up his scientific research and takes to money- 
making unabashed. Synthetic rubber brings him a 
large fortune, and, according to all rational theories, 
the couple are provided with everything that makes 
for happiness. But instead of realizing his blessings, 
Trafford becomes filled with a profound disgust with 
his whole scheme of life, and persuades Marjorie to 
join with him in a mad scheme of breaking away 
from all its artificial entanglements. The outcome 
is that they close their home, place their children in 
the care of relatives, and set out for of all places 
in the world Labrador. There they strike into 
the wilderness, establish a solitary winter camp, and 
talk things over interminably. At this point the book 
ceases to be a novel at all, and becomes a philo- 
sophical discussion of the deeper meaning of life. It 
is all immensely clever in its introspective analysis, 
and the interest does not flag although the action is 
arrested. Trafford breaks his leg and becomes delir- 
ious, revealing himself to Marjorie in his ravings, to, 
which she listens patiently for weeks. For example 
" I ought never to have married her never, never I I 
had my task. I gave myself to her. Oh ! the high immen- 
sities, the great and terrible things open to the mind of man ! 
And we breed children and live in littered houses and play 
with our food and chatter, chatter, chatter. Oh, the chatter 
of my life ! The folly I The women with their clothes. I can. 
hear them rustle now, whiff the scent of it ! The scandals 
as though the things they did with themselves and each other 
mattered a rap ; the little sham impromptu clever things, the 
trying to keep young and underneath it all that continual 
cheating, cheating, cheating, damning struggle for money ! " 

Presently he recovers consciousness, but talks on in 
the same strain for endless pages, discussing the prob- 
lems of the rational individual life and the rational 
organization of society. In his earlier books, Mr. 
Wells has suggested various nostrums fo* the relief 
of the world's imagined discontent, but he seems noT* 
to have lost faith in them, and to see no clear patL 
through the tangle. What he does not see is that 
the tangle is largely of his own creation, and that 
reason is slowly but surely working out its triumph 
over unreason in the ordering of human affairs. As 
for Trafford and Marjorie he leaves them on their 
way back to civilization, with a vivid experience to 
remember, but with nothing definitely solved, bear- 
ing with them their unhappy temperaments, which 
do not promise for them any greater peace of mind 
in the future than in the past.

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



Fontane's famous novel. It is an intimate story 
of Dutch life, full of the types of character which 
the author portrays with such delicate insight. It 
offers a variation upon the familiar "triangular" 
situation with which the majority of modern novels 
are concerned. The heroine is an imaginative crea- 
ture with a passionate sense of beauty, whose up- 
bringing has been of a nature to develop her native 
artistic temperament. The man whom she marries 
is the wrong one a prosaic person who is a model 
of all the homely virtues, a well-to-do landowner 
and ambitious politician, but narrow in his outlook, 
and wholly incapable of understanding the woman 
to whom he is married. The man who makes her 
an unfaithful wife is an aviator, who achieves fame 
by flying from the Hook to Harwich and back, an 
exploit with which all Europe resounds. When the 
news of his death in Paris comes to her, ahe makes 
confession of her guilt, and departs with her child to 
geek the protection of the nuns in a near-by convent. 
The author describes this story as "an incident of 
Paradise regained," which leaves one questioning. 
Is it really to regain Paradise to find happiness in an 
illicit love and to bear all the practical consequences 
of such a lapse? Like most of its predecessors, this 
book is largely one of conversations keen, witty, 
and often wise which reveal the inmost natures of 
the interesting and very human group of people with 
which it is concerned. It comes very near to being 
a work of genius. 

The Irish humorist who writes under the name 
of " G. A. Birmingham " is rapidly acquiring an 
enthusiastic clientele of American readers. Six of 
his novels have now appeared in the American edi- 
tions, and in the latest of these the author's powers 
of whimsical invention show no signs of exhaustion. 
The appetite for his work grows by what it feeds 
on, and "Priscilla's Spies" proves to be no less 
delightful than its predecessors. Priscilla is a re- 
freshingly nice girl of the torn-boy variety, and the 
prompt way in which she enlarges the experience 
of her cousin, the priggish public school boy who 
comes to visit her in the west of Ireland, is highly 
diverting. Her escapades have an imaginative touch. 
They are chiefly concerned with running to earth two 
mysterious strangers a young man and a young 
woman who appear in those parts, and cruise about 
the islands, camping in remote places. Priscilla pre- 
tends to believe that they are German spies engaged 
in the nefarious task of charting the coast. In reality 
they are a runaway couple a curate and his bride 
escaping from the paternal wrath of the bride's 
father, who is the official at the head of the War 
Office. When the latter arrives upon the scene, the 
game is up, but it is too late for him to do anything 
but forgive. Incidentally, there is disclosed the sec- 
ret of one of the islands, which the natives prevent 
visitors from approaching by a most ingenious and 
complicated system of lying. They have the best of 
reasons, for the island in question is the scene of a 
flourishing native industry of the kind which is dis- 
couraged by the revenue officers. Priscilla is a 



joyously original creature, and stands next in our 
affections to Lalage among the author's heroines. 
Her occasional comments upon English poetry 
(which she has reluctantly studied in school) fur- 
nish one of the most entertaining features of the 
story. 

Sir Arthur Doyle's "The Lost World" is a tale 
of amazing adventures in South America. A basaltic 
plateau, near the upper course of one of the tribu- 
taries of the Amazon, has in prehistoric ages been 
cut off by a cataclysmic elevation from participation 
in the life of the rest of the continent, and upon it 
have been preserved down to our own days such 
dragons of the prime as dinosaurs, and ichthyosaurs, 
and plesiosaurs, and iguanodons, besides a race of 
ape-men not much higher than the gorilla in develop- 
ment. To this region a well-assorted party of four 
explorers make their way, and have a most exciting 
time of it. These fearsome beasts, hitherto known 
only to palaeontology, are made to live and ravage 
before our very eyes, and the denizens of the Indian 
jungle are made to seem tame in comparison. The 
explorers barely escape with their lives, and return 
to London to tell their story with sensational effect, 
bringing with them as an exhibit a live plesiosaurus. 
The story is told by a newspaper reporter, who had 
joined the expedition to acquire merit in the eyes of 
a young woman named Gladys, who was to be satis- 
fied with nothing less than a hero. When he returns, 
sad to relate, Gladys has well-nigh forgotten him, and 
found consolation in the arms of one Potts, a solic- 
itor's clerk, who is anything but a hero. This is the 
only love-interest of the story, but it has enough in- 
terest of other sorts to atone for this culpable sin of 
omission. 

Since the lamented death of Vaughan Kester, 
which occurred soon after the publication of his 
sterling novel, "The Prodigal Judge," two posthu- 
mous novels from his pen have seen the light. One 
of them, "The Just and the Unjust," was a poor 
performance, which added nothing to his reputation. 
The other, "The Fortunes of the Landrays," now 
published, is a much finer work, and approaches 
within measurable distance the ideal which the pub- 
lic delights to envisage under the style of the Great 
American Novel. It is a typical story of American 
life during the last half of the nineteenth century, 
not the life of the great centres of population, which 
gets exploited in our newspapers and other works of 
fiction, but the life of the small community, in which 
the interests and purposes of our national character 
are less obscured and sophisticated in their expres- 
sion. The Landrays are one of the pioneer families 
of Benson, Ohio, and we first make their acquaint- 
ance in the year of the California gold discovery. 
The two brothers who represent the family, finding 
their fortunes somewhat decayed, join the Argonauts 
in their quest, taking the overland route, and become 
the victims of an Indian massacre. Their widows, 
one of whom has a son, are thus left in Benson to 
carry on the family tradition and sustain the family 
fortunes. The son, grown to manhood at the outbreak

of the Civil War, enters the army and remains in it 
until Appomattox puts an end to the struggle. He 
then goes into business, makes a failure of it, and 
dies, leaving a son to keep the name alive. This son, 
grown to manhood, and about to marry a girl whose 
family fortunes we have also followed for three gen- 
erations, is the chief object of our interest when the 
story ends, or rather stops short, at the beginning of 
the present century. We thus have a situation not 
unlike that of the play called "Milestones," and a 
treatment which is necessarily episodic. Whatever 
unity the plot possesses is due to the two characters 
whose lives span the entire period of the narrative. 
These are Virginia Landray, the widow of one of 
the ill-fated gold-hunters, and Jake Benson, the suc- 
cessful lawyer and man of substance, who persistently 
presses his suit upon her only to be definitely rejected. 
When faithfulness and devotion fail to achieve their 
aim, he becomes unfaithful, and, having charge of her 
business affairs, defrauds her in a peculiarly mean 
and revolting way, hoping to retain a hold upon her 
through her poverty. The way in which the fraud 
is eventually disclosed illustrates one of the many 
ingenious devices whereby the end of this novel is 
linked with its beginnings. It comes through the 
recovery of a document entrusted by Stephen Land- 
ray to the keeping of a small boy in the camp of 
the gold-seekers just before they are wiped out by 
the Indians. This boy is rescued, grows up in the 
household of a Mormon elder, becomes a prosperous 
ranchman, and, fifty years later, accidentally learns 
into whose hands the document should be given. The 
long arm of coincidence has to be worked in many 
other ways also to work into one pattern the many 
threads of this romantic history, but the ingenuity of 
the author is unfailing, and he does not strain our 
incredulity overmuch. In observation, variety of in- 
terest, and power of characterization, this book, with 
its presentation of a cross-section of the American 
life of its period, is really a noteworthy performance. 
"A Man's World," by Mr. Albert Edwards, "is 
the story of how I, born at the close of the Great 
War, lived, and of the things commonplace and 
unusual which happened to me, how they felt at 
the time and how I feel about them now." A book 
thus described does not fit easily into the conventional 
literary categories, and the author is quite right in his 
renunciation of the title of novelist, saying that the 
work has no unity " except the frame of mind which 
led me to write it, which has held me to task till now." 
These prefatory observations whet our expectations, 
for a story which should live up to the formula above 
given would obviously be something out of the com- 
mon. It would substitute reality for artifice, sincerity 
for simulation, and insight for the play of superficial 
observation. " A Man's World " does all of this, and 
more, giving us in the form of autobiography a pic- 
ture of everyday life which impresses the reader with 
its absolute honesty, and makes for the enlargement 
of his sympathies. It must be said also that it makes 
for the confusion of moral values, for it holds up "free 
love" as a tenable alternative to legalized marriage, 



and it bids us accept the metamorphosis of a foul- 
mouthed prostitute into a virtuous wife of high spirit- 
ual ideals. These matters are so dealt with that they 
do not seem to give offense when we read of them; 
it is only upon subsequent reflection, when we view 
them in the abstract, that we see them as they are. 
The story of the narrator's life begins in the South, 
and pictures his mind as it struggles to escape from 
the bondage of a narrow religious orthodoxy. The 
emancipation is fairly complete, and the boy goes to 
New York to earn his living. He drifts into literary 
hack work until his eyes give out, and then he drifts 
into social settlement work, in which he finds his 
true vocation. He becomes a sort of missionary in 
the Tombs, then a probation officer, and in the end a 
recognized authority upon penology. He comes to 
know thoroughly the seamy side of life, and finds a 
soul of good in most of the evil things that engage 
his attention. He elaborates no theories, but applies 
to each case that presents itself a broad human method 
of treatment which is sometimes effective, and some- 
times not. He goes straight to the heart of each 
concrete human problem, which is better than any 
doctrinaire course, even if it lead to mistakes now 
and then. He has all the time the vision of a better 
social order toward which mankind is slowly groping, 
and is content to think that he is obscurely helping 
to bring about the regeneration. He wins none of 
the prizes which we expect to come to the heroes of 
our novels, and even his one radiant love affair ends 
in disappointment. We leave him in middle life, 
confused but not embittered, a man who feels that 
his work is done, and that it has played, in its coral- 
insect way, "an integral part in the increment of 
wisdom." In the belief that the new generation is 
less handicapped than the old, and that it will know 
better how to deal with the problems of poverty, and 
suffering, and crime, the narrator ends his convincing 
tale of a human life lived in "a man's world." We 
notice a few conspicuous errors that ought to be cor- 
rected, such as " Compte " for the French positivist, 
"Safchen" for Heine's Sefchen, and "Guiseppe," 
the impossible name of the old Garibaldian. 

"My Love and I," by "Martin Redfield," is a 
discussion, in autobiographical form, of the problem 
dealt with by Mr. Wells in the novel previously 
reviewed. It has nothing of the richness of Mr. 
Wells's treatment, and relies more upon the con- 
ventional motives. There is another woman in the 
case, whom the man loves in secret, although he 
does not escape from the bondage that keeps him 
from her. He has married a girl simply because 
she is beautiful, and is left afterwards to make the 
discovery that she is hard, selfish, and mercenary. 
It is a common experience with men, and the present 
case is fairly typical. The hero is a popular novelist 
who prostitutes his art to meet the demands of his 
wife for display and social position. She, for her 
part, constantly wounds his susceptibilities by her 
inability to understand any ideal of life that is 
above the artificial and material plane. She fawns 
upon a wealthy spinster in the hope of an inherit-

ance, and secretly takes money from a former lover 
to gratify her mean desires and ambitions. There 
are many quarrels, but no domestic crash, and the 
other woman remains a star that dwells apart. The 
story has a rare degree of sincerity, which makes it 
more convincing than most works of fiction. Such 
tragedies will continue to exist as long as men take 
to themselves wives knowing nothing more of them 
than may be seen upon the surface, and the interests 
of society sternly demand that the obligations thus 
heedlessly incurred shall be kept, whatever their 
cost of individual suffering. 

''The Secret of Frontellac," by Mr. Frank K. 
Scribner, is a mystery story of considerable ingen- 
uity and picturesque in its setting. An American 
becomes the heir to a French chateau, and proceeds 
to take possession. He finds that it has been a 
rallying-place for the irreconcilable faction of 
French royalists ever since the Revolution, and he 
unearths documents which lead him to believe that 
somewhere within its precincts are hidden the trea- 
sure rifled from the royal tombs at St. De"nis at the 
time of the sacrilege of 1793. Searching for this 
treasure, the occupant becomes aware that his 
movements are watched, and supposes that the 
government is suspicious of him. Ambushes and 
attempted assassinations follow, and at last the 
treasure is unearthed in the shape of gold ingots 
bearing a modern date. It seems that the Bank 
of France has been robbed of a million francs, and 
that the swag has been planted in the grounds of 
the castle. Whereupon the American is arrested for 
complicity in the crime, and has a hard time proving 
his innocence. A little elementary science would 
have saved the author from endowing sulphur with 
the properties of phosphorus (a frequent blunder 
with novelists), or from having his hero nonchal- 
antly pick up the treasure-chest, unaware that a 
million francs will weigh the greater part of a ton. 
Since the hero has inherited with the castle the 
guardianship of a beautiful girl, he is richly con- 
soled in the outcome for the perils that have beset 
his path. WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

Among the haps and mishaps of the 

luckle88 Bourbon famil y' the fate of 

the little Dauphin, son of Louis XVI. 
and Marie Antoinette, has " kept guessing " a certain 
number of well-meaning people, whose Legitimist 
devotion to the head of the family, whether on or 
off a throne, is little short of pathetic. Regarding 
the Revolution as a spasm, yielding only a reluctant 
and provisional assent to the eighteen years' reign of 
the Orleans branch as represented in Louis Philippe, 
looking on the present republic, in spite of its forty- 
one years of vigorous life, as a mistake some time to 
be rectified, they have lavished on " Louis XVII." 
a passionate devotion only equalled by the Jacobite 
loyalty to the Stuart Pretenders. These claimants 



to the English throne had, however, the enormous 
advantage of being always ocularly in evidence; 
while the name and claims of Charles Louis de 
Bourbon, Duke of Normandy, were assumed by 
half-a-dozen men at different times and places. As 
only one of these could be the rightful heir, the ques- 
tion of identity was of course vital to any successful 
prosecution of the cause. What became of the little 
prince after he was separated from his mother on 
July 3, 1793, and committed to the rude mercies of 
his jailer Simon in the Temple prison? Did he die 
there, as was asserted and generally believed, on the 
8th of June, 1795, or was another child, already 
moribund, substituted for the Dauphin and the latter 
smuggled out of the prison, to lead a wandering 
and precarious life for fifty years longer, under the 
assumed name of Naundorf ? Among the various 
works which have espoused and pressed the cause 
of Naundorf as the real Louis XVII., probably the 
most exhaustive in detail and energetic in spirit has 
been Henri Provins's "Dernier Roi Le'gitime de 
France," which has now been made available for 
English readers by Miss Phoebe Allen, in a volume 
called "The Last Legitimate King of France" (Dut- 
ton). The work is modestly described as a "com- 
pilation," based on the researches and writings of 
Henri Provins, Otto Friedrichs, and others. It con- 
stitutes a sustained and elaborate special plea in sup- 
port of the claim that "Louis XVII. was secretly 
taken from the Tower in the Temple some time be- 
tween the middle of October and the beginning of 
November, 1794, and that he left the Temple early 
in June, 1795; that his place in the Tower was sup- 
plied by a deaf and dumb child, who served as his 
substitute until probably the end of March, 1795; 
that the deaf-mute was in his turn exchanged for a 
second substitute, the moribund child whose death 
in the Tower and subsequent autopsy did really and 
truly take place." After various imprisonments and 
escapes, the young man emerges in Berlin in 1810 
with a passport bearing the name of Naundorf. For 
the thirty-five years ensuing, until his death in 1845, 
he led the adventurous life of a Claimant. He bore 
certain physical marks known to have been on the 
person of the Dauphin, and recalled correctly various 
intimate details of the life in the prison which could 
have been known to the Dauphin only. He also pos- 
sessed two documents in the handwriting of Marie 
Antoinette and Louis XVI., which were taken by 
the Prussian government and never returned. It is 
simply amazing, the enormous mass of evidence 
some of it convincing, some trivial which has been 
accumulated in this volume of over four hundred 
pages, to prove the parti pris. Delia Bacon was by 
contrast a cold and timorous advocate of her heresy. 
The work is conceived in a spirit of bitterness toward 
all who were skeptical as to Naundorf's pretensions. 
As the prince's sister, the Duchess of Angoulme, 
and his uncles, Louis XVIII. and Charles X., could 
naturally never be brought to look with anything but 
a forbidding eye on Naundorf's appeals for recogni- 
tion, the author has no good words for them; and

Louis Philippe is also castigated for his refusals to 
open the claimant's case when repeatedly begged to 
do so. Europe's interest in the " Cause," which had 
grown somewhat tepid, was roused to a fitful warmth 
by the recent appeal (1911) made to the Senate in 
Paris by the descendants of Naundorf for favorable 
consideration of their claims; and some hitherto 
unpublished evidence was brought to light, which is 
included, with all the rest, in the present work. 
On the whole, the book may be recommended as a 
spirited though one-sided representation of one of 
the great mysteries of history. 

The" man ^ * s an amaz i n g thing that any 

farthest down " American, in a seven weeks' race 
in Europe. through Europe, from Scotland to 

Sicily and from Sicily to Scandinavia, should dis- 
cover enough that is new to serve as material for a 
book worth the reading. That such a book should 
throw light upon important problems of our own 
is still more amazing. The wonder of it disap- 
pears, however, upon the mention of the author's 
name, for Booker T. Washington is a professional 
wonder-worker. What Mr. Washington set out to 
find was the "man farthest down" in European 
countries, in order to compare his position with that 
of the man farthest down in America, the negro. 
This, at any rate, was his avowed purpose; his 
unavowed design was to discover what hope for 
the future the most wretched of Europeans might 
justly entertain, and to bring back some of that 
hope to his own people. Wretchedness enough he 
found. He saw youths in the sulphur mines subject 
to a worse slavery than the negroes have ever known 
in America. He saw coasts that must be guarded by 
soldiers to keep wretched peasants from stealing 
the waters of the sea. He saw women serving as 
beasts of draught and of burden. In some of the 
countries visited he saw evidence of race prejudice 
more bitter, race oppression more cruel, than that of 
our own country at its worst. But everywhere, he 
found reason to believe, conditions are gradually 
improving. The man farthest down is rising. And 
in some cases this appears to be due to the very fact 
of racial oppression. 

" Of the three sections of the Polish race, German, Rus- 
sian and Austrian, there are two in which . . . the [Polish] 
people are oppressed, and one in which they seem to be, if 
anything, the oppressors. In Russian Poland and in German 
Poland the Polish are making a desperate struggle to main- 
tain their national existence, but in these two countries the 
Poles are prosperous. ... In Austrian Poland, on the con- 
trary, where the Austrian government, in order, perhaps, 
to hold the political aspirations of the Ruthenians in check, 
has given them a free hand in the government of the prov- 
ince, . . . they have made less progress." 

Not more than two hundred and fifty years ago 
so gifted a man as Holberg could believe that intel- 
ligence and political capacity are by nature denied 
to all but the hereditary aristocracy. There are still 
cultivated Englishmen who will assert that the Irish 
lack capacity for government; we who have been 
governed by them know better. The German is con- 
vinced of the political incompetence of the Poles; 



the Poles, of that of the Ruthenians; the Hunga- 
rians know of a certainty that the Slovaks lack civic 
qualities. We who have seen Germans and Poles 
and Ruthenians, Hungarians and Slovaks, under 
equal laws, and with equal opportunities, gradually 
transforming themselves into typical Americans, 
know what value to place upon Old World super- 
stitions of congenital inferiorities and superiorities, 
social and racial. We have our own congenital 
superiorities and inferiorities white and black. 
Possibly these alone of their kind are real and 
eternal. Even so, they need not prevent a vast 
improvement in the lot of the black man. (Double- 
day, Page & Co.) 

coeur de Lion Those who are interested in the psy- 
and the chology of authorship will not turn 

landscape. lightly from Miss Maude M. Hoi- 

bach's " In the Footsteps of Richard Coeur de Lion " 
(Little, Brown, & Co.). The writer is not content 
with following those footsteps, biographically, to her 
hero's last fateful strides before Chaluz. She pro- 
ceeds, in the second part of the book, to lead us 
through various regions once traversed by him, 
pointing out whatever footprints still remain and 
also inviting our attention to much scenery which 
(like Quince's "bill of properties") but slenderly 
illuminates the main plot. Does the work as a whole, 
then, belong to the genus Travel or Popular Biog- 
raphy ? In body, to the latter for part one takes 
up two-thirds of the book ; in spirit, however, chiefly 
to the former. Part one presents us with a scenic 
life of the Lion-Heart; and does so, on the whole, 
excellently. The writer has had a keen eye for all 
that is picturesque in the chronicles ; and her con- 
siderable narrative and descriptive powers enable 
her to make effective use of what constitutes her dis- 
tinctive equipment, an extraordinary familiarity 
with the scenes of Richard's activities. In part two 
the lion, indeed, is off the stage ; but the atmosphere 
remains the same. The author has something of 
Shakespeare's skill in reminding us of what has 
happened " behind the scene "; and when allusion to 
Richard fails why, then there is Herod or Napo- 
leon. So that in part two Richard, aided by others, 
illuminates the landscape ; whereas in part one the 
landscape illuminates Richard. To be sure, towns 
and countrysides can throw but little light on a man's 
inner nature unless he happens to be an architect 
or a landscape gardener. And it is unfortunate that 
Miss Holbach implies, in her opening chapter and 
elsewhere, an intention of rendering a truer picture 
than has yet been of Richard's personality. She 
adds nothing, in this respect, to accounts given in 
the various historical works (particularly in Kate 
Norgate's admirable book on the Angevins) which 
she quotes so liberally in her own text. Like many 
other makers of popular biography, she seems oblivi- 
ous to the fact that nice discrimination as well as 
historic bent, and much logical thinking as well as 
whole-hearted interest, are required for the delinea- 
tion of a notable individuality. Miss Holbach's

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



pictorial account, however, is thoroughly sincere. 
Indeed, her whole book rings true. It thus stands 
in pleasing contrast to those numerous minor works 
in which inadequate history appears in the service 
of cheap artistic effects* 

Reminiscences it takes an heroic effort of intellec- 
Oerman n tual charity to forgive Dr. G. Stanley 

philosophers. Hall for calling his collection of 
studies of eminent men who appealed to his, as 
to so many others', interests in his pilgrimages to 
Germany, "The Founders of Modern Psychology" 
( Appleton) . To the last of the group, who is properly 
accorded the largest space, the title rightly belongs. 
Wilhelm Wundt, who this year celebrated his eighti- 
eth birthday, has in his own career witnessed the 
emergence of a new insight into the nature of the 
world of mind and the methods of its pursuit, and 
himself played a pioneer's part in the occupation. 
Helmholtz was a versatile genius who solved a con- 
siderable range of problems by which the psycholo- 
gist eagerly profited. Fechner has a quasi-legitimate 
rank as a founder ; but the sketch presented though 
less engaging than the slighter essay of James 
shows the otherwise directed bent of his major in- 
terests. Von Hartmann, Lotze, and Zeller are 
rightfully claimed by philosophy and have had but 
a negligible influence in shaping modern psychology, 
though they labored in fields where a psychological 
harvest (or gleaning) was inevitable. But apart from 
Dr. Hall's title, his collection of studies deals with 
notable men who made notable contributions to the 
philosophic renaissance of the nineteenth century in 
Germany. They seem heroic figures, despite their 
proximity to our own outlook ; and yet the studies 
carry a reminiscent air. Dr. Hall had a living ac- 
quaintance with all these men, casual in some cases, 
but enough to catch the direct inspiration of personal 
contact which attracted the scholarly-minded of his 
generation to the seats of learning in Germany, and 
kept them there long enough to catch its spirit and 
successfully transplant it to the new world. The 
studies make difficult reading, unrelieved by felici- 
ties or facilities of presentation ; they often suggest 
the careful digest of a conscientious student, yet one 
keeping in mind the principles of interest that give 
unity of interpretation, and the critical sense that 
must weigh and judge as well as record the data of 
judgment. There is often a plethora of detail that 
reflects the formlessness which the younger Germans 
are discarding as an impediment of progress, how- 
ever imposing as the baggage of learning. As a 
record of the contributions of a related group of 
scholars who made a critical epoch in the Wissen- 
schaft which is our direct heritage, the volume oc- 
cupies a unique place and serves a helpful purpose. 

Superstition ManV P arts f India ffer a rich 

and omens of harvest for the anthropologist or 
Southern India, ethnologist, and from the lower end 
of the peninsula Mr. Edgar Thurston has garnered 
an attractive bundle of sheaves, which he presents 



in a volume entitled " Omens and Superstitions of 
Southern India" (McBride, Nast & Co.). The au- 
thor was formerly Superintendent of the Madras 
Government Museum and of the Ethnographic Sur- 
vey of the Madras Presidency, and has published a 
number of works on kindred subjects. The present 
contribution contains twelve chapters, with such 
captions as "Snake Worship," "Charms," "Human 
Sacrifice," "Magic and Magicians," and "Rain- 
making Ceremonies." The general treatment seems 
to represent a compromise between the scientist and 
the layman, but inclining rather to the latter. The 
net result is a volume that does not enlarge the 
boundaries of science, but does treat its deliberately 
limited field with considerable thoroughness, while 
reporting much that is interesting for the general 
reader. As an illustration of the latter phase, we 
may adduce the story of the idol protected from 
desecration at night by a cobra. " When the doors 
are being shut, the snake slides in, and coils itself 
round the lingam. Early in the morning, when 
the priest opens the door, it glides away, without 
attempting to harm any of the large number of spec- 
tators, who never fail to assemble." More thrilling is 
the account, twice recorded, of the Shanan who was 
working on the top of a palmyra palm when a high 
wind broke off the stalk and he was wafted gently 
to the earth by a huge leaf, which acted as a natural 
parachute. Again, there is much suggestiveness in 
an instance of demon worship: the demon was an 
English officer, killed about a hundred years ago, 
and the worship " consisted in offering to his manes 
spirituous liquors and cheroots." Then another 
paragraph will send a very different current along 
the reader's nerves: "As recently as 1902 a Euro- 
pean magistrate in Ganjam received a petition, 
asking for permission to perform a human sacrifice, 
which was intended to give a rich colour to the 
turmeric crop." And even later than this there 
have been unmistakable examples of the slaying of 
children to procure the help of some god. Exact- 
ing students will regret that Mr. Thurston has not 
always indicated more clearly the value he places 
on his authorities, although his sources of informa- 
tion are generally given. The author's English is 
simple and unstudied almost to an extreme. The 
volume is well printed and generally presentable.

evolution. j s a C0 n e ction of nature essays of a 

kind that is new, not only in Mr. Burroughs's work, 
but in literature. It was to be expected that Mr. 
Burroughs, who has more of the scientific attitude 
than had any of his predecessors in nature writing, 
would turn sooner or later to questions of geology and 
biology, and he has at last done so in a book that 
is both wise and entertaining. It is the result, as 
he remarks in the preface, " of the stages of brood- 
ing and thinking which I have gone through" in 
embracing the doctrine of evolution. Most of us 
accept this doctrine quite as our forebears normally

accepted the doctrines of Christianity without 
question, almost without interest; and we avoid 
learned treatises on the subject because they are 
presumably dull. Mr. Burroughs's essays are in 
the main a visualization of evolution, an attempt to 
open our eyes and our minds to " Primal Energies " 
and "The Hazards of the Past" and all the infinitely 
wonderful events that took place on "The Long 
Road"; they are an emotional yet thoughtful in- 
quiry into the problems of modern science science 
touched with emotion. As such, they are thoroughly 
readable, despite the prevalence of Mr. Burroughs's 
inveterate weakness, repetition. "I am aware," 
he writes, "that there is much repetition in them"; 
there is indeed, and it wellnigh spoils them. The 
first essay is a marvel of lack of evolution in style : 
back and forth it runs, and across, like a dog seeking 
the scent. The annoyance that the reader suffers 
is diminished somewhat by the skilful arrangement 
of the essays; they become more and more specific 
as we go on, and the semi-narrative essays, such 
as " Holidays in Hawaii," afford some relief. The 
concluding chapter, on "The Gospel of Nature," 
contains soonany interesting and significant remarks 
that one finds it difficult to forbear quotation. 

A great military General Sherman at the head of an 
commander as academy of half a hundred undis- 
college president. c i p ii ne d boy s, and pestered with 
such petty administrative details as the detection 
and punishment of the young scapegrace who had 
daubed with hair-oil all the blackboards and chairs 
in one of the recitation rooms, presents a picture 
not at all familiar to those in whose imagination he 
is either marching victoriously through Georgia or 
standing shoulder to shoulder with Grant in repuls- 
ing with heavy loss the assaults of Confederate 
armies. Yet this is the picture of him, painted 
chiefly by himself, that is offered us in a noteworthy 
volume compiled and edited by Professor Walter L. 
Fleming, of the Louisiana State University, and 
published by the Arthur H. Clark Company of 
Cleveland. "General W. T. Sherman as College 
President" is succinctly described on its title-page 
as "a collection of letters, documents, and other 
material, chiefly from private sources, relating to 
the life and activities of General William Tecumseh 
Sherman, to the early years of Louisiana State Uni- 
versity, and to the stirring conditions existing in the 
South on the eve of the Civil War; 1859-1861." 
Sherman applied for and obtained the position of 
superintendent of the State Seminary of Learning 
at Alexandria, upon its organization in 1859, and 
he entered on his new duties with the opening of the 
year 1860, holding also the professorship of engi- 
neering, architecture, and drawing. He remained 
at Alexandria, ably guiding the fortunes of what 
was ere long to become the State University of 
Louisiana until the strained relations between North 
and South made him feel in honor bound to relin- 
quish his post and throw in his lot with the Union. 
His personal and official correspondence for those 



two years is now for the first time brought to light 
by one enjoying exceptional facilities for the col- 
lecting and editing of these interesting documents, 
and the volume, suitably illustrated and sufficiently 
annotated, forms a valuable appendix or companion 
piece to Sherman's "Personal Memoirs." It shows 
the man at a critical period of his life. 

A treatise ? r - Hubert Parry's "Style in Mus- 

on style in ical Art" (Macmillan) consists of a 

musical art. series of lectures delivered recently 
at Oxford. While the volume has the necessary 
academic completeness, it maintains also the interest 
which appeals to the larger audience. Style, Dr. 
Parry tells us, "may be considered from as many 
points of view as there are causes or conditions 
which induce it. They interlace and mingle without 
necessarily disturbing or confusing one another. 
Some are plain and easily distinguished, and some 
are hard to define ; some are elementary, inevitable, 
persistent ; some are elusive and resultant. Material 
causes, general causes, psychological, racial, and per- 
sonal causes, associations and conditions of present- 
ment, all influence and control its variations, of which 
anyone with a glimmering of artistie or literary 
sense is conscious." This passage indicates the 
method of treatment. To each phase of the subject 
is devoted one or more lectures, and the historic or 
evolutionary procedure is followed in each case. 
From the first instinctive recognition of an element 
through its conscious manipulation up to its free and 
artistic use the unfoldment proceeds. One wonders 
why the treatment is not made more systematic ; Dr. 
Parry announces the principles underlying the mass 
of material, but he employs these principles only in 
the subsidiary phases, not in the whole. This gives 
a somewhat encyclopaedic aspect to his discussion, 
but the accumulation of detail is after all very well 
ordered. The subject of style is here treated with 
the consideration which its importance demands. 
The work is remarkably comprehensive, and indeed 
is authoritative in its field. The great art with 
which it deals is discussed not only from the side of 
its technique, but also from the side of its content 
or significance. It is a work which deserves the 
serious attention of all who are interested in music.

to earn for those children the advantages that would

with briskness and vivacity in "Thirteen Years of

of autobiography signed by Mrs. Alec Tweedie. In

youth. It makes children think, which youth nursed 
in luxury seldom does. Adversity only came to me 
in my twenties. Youth is often spent courting time, 
middle age in chasing time, and old age, alas! in 
killing time." Mrs. Tweedie's biography of her 
father, Dr. George Harley, and her books about 
Mexico and its seven-times president are well known, 
as also are others of the thirteen volumes she has 
produced in as many years. Her large output of 
newspaper and magazine writing in the same period 
was probably what chiefly paid the household bills, 
though it will be sooner forgotten. Her account of 
her various travels in quest of book-material, of the 
hardships and bodily dangers she has faced, of the 
illustrious persons she has met, and a great variety of 
other matters such as a bright and observant woman 
knows how to make the most of in a narrative of the 
kind she has so entertainingly written, will be greatly 
enjoyed by those who like to read of real life strenu- 
ously lived by energetic people. 



Washington and In Wsvolume entitled "Washington 
Lincoln as and Lincoln " (Putnam), Mr. Robert 

related leaders, yf McLaughlin attempts a rather 
unusual task. Inasmuch as the names of Washington 
and Lincoln are generally coupled as the two great- 
est of our history, it has seemed to the author that 
the relation of these two leaders in governmental 
action and theory should be traced. He assumes a 
general conviction, " which deepens with the years, 
that the two ' Fathers ' mastered the ideas that con- 
stitute the basis of our national structure," and he 
endeavors to show that the two men acted on the 
same great principles of government, the "im- 
perial ideal " with power lodged at the centre dis- 
tinct from and in addition to power in the parts. 
Both the aristocrat and the democrat subscribed to 
the political creed that power as expressed in law, is 
derived from the people, "yet the words did not 
mean exactly the same to each. Washington saw 
the people in the law ; Lincoln saw the law in the 
people." Mr. McLaughlin traces the course of our 
political development, from the English attempt at 
parliamentary control in 1765 through the revolu- 
tionary era, the constitutional era, the national era, 
and the civil war era, to show Washington's theory 
of government and his influence upon the course of 
affairs, and then Lincoln's, and to show that the 
abuse of its power by the controlling group called 
both to leadership for the correction of these abuses. 
The attempt is interesting, but hardly convincing in 
the matter of establishing the close relation in ideas 
that he sees between the two leaders. 



Memorials of 
Dante in 



Dante lovers have long felt and 
deplored the absence in Florence of 
modern Florence. ue&T \y a y traces of the great poet 
whose birthplace it was more than six hundred years 
ago. The house in which he was born, the stone on 
the spot where he was supposed to have sat as a boy 
to watch the Duomo a-building, the battered portrait 
on the Bargello wall, these have seemed almost 



his only remaining memorials in the modern city. 
In a book entitled "With Dante in Modern Flor- 
ence " (Dutton), Miss Mary E. Lacy has recorded 
and described whatever now remains to throw light 
on the " Divina Commedia " or its author. With 
its help, the reader or tourist may reconstruct in 
great measure the Florence in which Dante lived 
until, under sentence of death, he became an exile 
for twenty years. The picture of those times, in 
politics, in art, in society, and religion, is briefly but 
vividly drawn ; and the twenty-eight illustrations, 
though mostly modern, help to connect present and 
past. A concluding chapter, " Florence Repentant," 
relates how all too late the city that the poet 
so passionately loved has done and continues to do 
all that is in her power to wipe out the shame of 
centuries. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Mrs. Wilfrid Jackson has translated M. Auatole 
France's ironic masterpiece "La Rotisserie de la Reine 
Pe'dauque," and the work is published by John Lane Co. 
in their library edition of the author's works. Mr. W. 
J. Locke contributes an introduction, which seems to 
afford a felicitous conjunction of wits. 

A sense of filial obligation has led Miss Helen Nicolay 
to carry out a plan long cherished by her father of sup- 
plementing his great history of Lincoln and his times by 
a small and more intimate volume portraying the man 
as Nicolay knew him in the close association of many 
years. He had collected a great mass of anecdotes 
and incidents illustrating Lincoln's personal traits; but 
the work was not done, and now the daughter has ful- 
filled her father's unfinished task in the volume entitled 
" Personal Traits of Abraham Lincoln " (Century). No 
new light is thrown on Lincoln's career or character, but 
the work is valuable in that as far as may be it separates 
the man from the times and shows him as he was in his 
daily life and personal relations. Such chapters as those 
on " Lincoln's Attitude toward Money," " President Lin- 
coln, his Wife and Children," "Daily Receptions of the 
Plain People," " Life at the White House," and " His 
Reason and his Heart " give the reader a new and clear 
insight into the character of Lincoln. 

Miss H. A. Guerber, the author of various manuals 
of legends and stories, is now making her industrious 
way through Shakespeare, her latest production being 
a volume of " Stories of Shakespeare's English History 
Plays " (Dodd, Mead & Co.). That Shakespeare can be 
retold with delight and edification, Charles Lamb proved 
once for all; and though one hesitates to commend this 
method of making the dramatist's acquaintance, doubt- 
less there are times when a short cut may serve a use- 
ful purpose. There may be readers, too, who cannot 
relish such language, for example, as that of the angry 
Douglas, seeking out the king among those who are fnr- 
nished like him, " I'll murder all his wardrobe, piece 
by piece ! " but would really prefer to be told that 
" Douglas hastens away, vowing he will kill all the kings 
on the battle-field, since a number of knights are incased 
in royal armor." For all such, Miss Guerber's book is 
to be commended. Its method brings out, with con- 
siderable emphasis, the instructive value of this epic 
cycle of plays.

intended foundation of this professorship was announced 
two years ago, Sir Harold Harmsworth giving Cam- 
bridge University 20,000 for its endowment. 

Homer Lea, author of " The Day of the Saxon," re- 
viewed in our last issue, died in Los Angeles November 1, 
at the age of thirty-six. Besides the book above named, 
he was the author of "The Vermilion Pencil," a novel;

concise encyclopaedia, to be issued in twelve volumes of 
about 640 pages each, uniform in size and general style 
with "Everyman's." The first volume of this important 
work will be issued in January next, and the others at 
regular intervals thereafter. 

The biography of George Frederick Watts, to be pub- 
lished shortly by Messrs. Macmillan, will doubtless con- 
stitute a record of an artistic and personal career of 
remarkable interest. The work has been prepared by 
Mrs. G. F. Watts, and consists of three volumes. Of 
these the first two include the biography proper, the 
last containing various writings and hitherto unpublished 
notes by G. F. Watts on artistic subjects.

Constitutional Government in the United States 

By WOODROW WILSON 
12mo, cloth, pp. vii. 236 $1.50 net; by mail, $1.62 

THE CHAPTERS AKE: What is Constitutional Government ? 
The Place of the United States in Constitutional Development; 
The President of the United States ; The House of Represent- 
atives; The Senate; The Courts; The States and the Federal 
Government ; Party Government in the United States. 

The book, according to the author in his preface, is not 
intended as a systematic discussion of the character and opera- 
tion of the Government of the United States, but is a presen- 
tation of some of its salient features in the light of a fresh 
analysis of the character and operation of constitutional gov- 
ernment. The hope is further expressed that, for this reason, 
the book will be found to be serviceable in the clarification of 
the public view as to policy and practice.

2 Volumes. $4.00 net; by mail $4.21 

The London Spectator: "The range of these six hundred and thirty 
pages of Meredith's correspondence is so enormous that it is difficult to make 
up one's mind at what point to approach it. The volume of Meredith's 
personality was immense, and here we see it in full flood through sixty 
strenuous years. Every line is animated by his wonderful relish and 
curiosity for life. On every page there waves his banner, and beneath it 
rumbles and flashes all the artillery of his passionate and brilliant eloquence." 

Phila. Public Ledger: ''They open a window into the mind of the man.'' 

Boston Transcript: "Two volumes that disclose the workings of the 
mind of a genius."

whose " Lords and Lovers " and " Semiramis " gave her not 
only a position in the front rank of American poets, but 
a position peculiarly her own. 

" The Mortal Gods " itself deals with current social 
philosophy in an imaginary country, and might almost have 
been written with reference to our own political situation. 
" A Son of Hermes " is a drama of the time of Alcibiades ; 
" The Sword of Love " turns on a Crusade of the Twelfth 
Century. 



A Domestic Drama in Three Acts 
60 cents net; postpaid 70 cents 

This drama, with an English country house for its setting, 
has all the concentrated power of " Strife " and " Justice." 
Constructively it is perfect : without a pause in the action, 
the situation depending on the entanglement of " the 
eldest son " is exposed, and the characters, drawn from 
the upper and lower classes, are introduced. 

The Inn of Tranquillity 

$1.30 net; postpaid $1.39 

This new collection of shorter writings is divided into two 
sections : " Concerning Life " and " Concerning Letters." 
The second has a special value in that therein Mr. Gals- 
worthy sets forth his ideas of what art is and of what a 
novelist and dramatist and poet should be. The first is 
rather similar to that charming earlier volume of sketches 
called " A Motley."

The most enthralling stories are primitive legends like

in it a line of preaching or of posing. And it is written in a style of great simplicity, clarity,

This is a masterly study of Rousseau's life and age. The

RECIPIENT OF THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR LITERATURE 

single work will illustrate better than this novel Hauptmann's supreme influence in 
contemporary European letters. Like many classics, it will interest different people for 
different reasons: some will cafe for its narrative, to others it will appeal because of its 
symbolism, and again there are those who will respond primarily to its psychology. The dual 
nature of the hero attempts to attune itself to conflicting influences; it is the old struggle be- 
tween the spirit and the flesh. A pen sensitive to the nuances of life describes the gaieties of 
an ocean voyage, the thrilling tragedy of a sinking vessel, the sordid side of the theatre in New 
York, and the forces virtue, hypocrisy, art, puritanism that contribute to the spirit of 
America.

MARK TWAIN: A BIOGRAPHY 

By ALBERT BIGELOW PAINE 

Never, never, never, has there been such extravagant praise, such spenthrift acclaim of any book. Of 
course it is the book of the year, but the press seems to speak of it as almost the book of a hundred years. 
Humor, interestingness, delightful style, fun, history, adventure, travel, the society of exalted personages 
and unexalted these are some of the hundred angles by which this book attracts. It makes a great 
Christmas present.

YOUR UNITED STATES 

By Arnold Bennett 

No English writer since Thackeray has been welcomed to the 
United States with such spontaneous enthusiasm as Arnold 
Bennett. All doors were open to him. He saw more in a 
comparatively brief visit than most of us see in a lifetime. 
Our daily life, our society, our sports, our theatres, our 
schools and colleges. East and West, all come in for their 
share of his sane and graceful appreciation.

THE WAYS OF THE PLANETS 

By Martha Evans Martin 

An accurate but untechnical, interesting account of the 
planets and their movements, with easy and sure directions 
for finding them, identifying them, and following them in all 
their comings and goings through the year. It is a thor- 
oughly entertaining book as well as a thoroughly useful one. 
It is, in fact, the same genial introduction to the planets as 
" The Friendly Stars " has proved to be to the stars.

was an appreciated guest at the court of Napoleon III. and a

the Commune. The book includes many letters written to 
her family during this period, all of which contain a wealth 
of intimate detail.

LINCOLN'S OWN STORIES 

By Anthony Gross 

For many years Mr. Gross, an enthusiastic student of 
Abraham Lincoln's life, has been collecting and verifying 
the best of the stories told by Lincoln and about Lincoln. 
These stories have been carefully arranged, and the remark- 
able collection which is the result is presented in a book of 
engrossing interest in its humor and pathos, and its illumi- 
nation of historic characters and events.

ON HAZARDOUS SERVICE 

By William Gilmore Beymer 

Courage and reckless daring are here told in true tales of 
those men. now well-nigh forgotten, who did their work 
alone and obscurely, unhonored and unsung, in the face of 
ignominious death the spies and scouts of the Secret 
Service. The true stories of their daring deeds have been 
gathered from original sources and form a fascinating and 
important addition to American history and heroism.

THE NET By Rex Beach 

A story so full of dramatic fire that it fairly snaps and 
crackles. Tender love, scintillating humor, and the vio- 
lence of unbridled passion, course neck and neck through 
every turbulent page. Yet, when the tumult and the shout- 
ing die, one remembers only the story of a love so strong 
and pure and tender that it warms the very cockles of the 
heart.

THE FINANCIER 

By Theodore Dreiser 

Once in every four years a big book, an unusual book, comes 
to the surface. We believe " The Financier " is such a book. 
It is only fair to say that it is almost brutal in its naked 
picturing of the lust for wealth, and the hunger for love. It 
is not for those who fear the fighting force of a strong man, 
but taken all in all in its bigness, its insight into larger 
phases of our life it seems destined to rank as one of the 
great examples of modern fiction.

THE VOICE 

By Margaret Deland 

A new Dr. Lavendar story and a new heroine two Margaret 
Deland treats which make the perfect holiday book for read- 
ing or giving. By way of good measure, this story is located 
in Old Chester. The parson's wooing of Philippa, the girl's 
affection for her eccentric father, and the final triumph of 
the little blind god, make quite the quaintest and most 
charming story that Mrs. Deland has yet told.

PAUL RUNDEL 

By Will N. Harben 

Plain people, people of primitive instincts fierce haters, 
strong lovers, wild doubters, rough believers these are 
the mountain people of Southern Georgia whom Mr. Harben 
here portrays. 

He is a realist as genuine as Tolstoi. He deals only 
with vital things. He delineates with masterly skill Paul's 
wonderful moral and religious transformation, and the 
awakening of his love for her who teaches him the meaning 
of faith and loyalty. 

Frontispiece. Post 8vo. Cloth. $1.30 net 



THE MOTH 

By William Dana Orcutt 

The fascinating story of a flighty young fool of a woman who 
drags her two best friends down into the morass of a sordid- 
seeming scandal . Her conduct is apt to fill the average reader 
with a strong desire to shake her, which is the best proof of 
the reality of her personality as the author has placed it in 
his pages. 

Frontispiece. Cloth. $1.30 net 



THE RED LANE 

By Holman Day 

A virile romance of the Maine-Canadian border. None other 
than a writer who has sojourned among these simple- 
hearted and clean-faithed folks, who has learned their ways, 
their nobleness, and their frailties, their reverence for author- 
ity, their loves, hates, and passions could have so adequately 
painted the very human characters that unite in making a 
volume which the reader is loath to lay aside.

THE ROCKET BOOK 

Peter Newell's Newest Funny Creation 

A new Peter Newell book is a new joy for both young and old. 
In this book the mischievous son of the janitor sets off a 
sky-rocket in the basement of an apartment house. The 
rocket merrily pops up through the floor of the first flat, 
boring a neat hole through the center of the dinner table. 
On and on it goes through bathtubs and many other adven- 
tures to the top floor, where it starts through an ice-cream 
freezer. But, alas, the ice is too cold, and the rocket's career 
is ended. There are twenty-two full-page pictures, printed 
in four combinations of colors, and each scene is described in 
verses by Mr. Newell.

"Out of the West comes a Lochinvar of story-tellers to 
bear his readers once more ' beyond speed limits and grass 
signs to where life has ceased to 
be a series of coes and a man is 
still a man.' To those who like 
Western 'yarns' for their refresh- 
ing dissimilarity to their own en- 
vironment and to those who still 
like to read aloud ' Friar Tuck ' 
is to be commended. Mr. Wason 
has the gift of naturally humorous 
expression and 'Friar Tuck' is 
assured a large popularity." 

Boston Transcript. 

"'Thank the good Lord for 
Wason ! ' exclaimed one of Brook- 
lyn's most noted divines a few 
evenings ago, as he read, with a 
deep sigh of regret, the last para- 
graph of ' Friar Tuck.' So say we, 
all of us ! A great story, a delight 
and a glory!" Brooklyn Citizen.

admirably what its title claims for 
it, and should be of genuine value

A TEACHER OF THE SPIRIT. 



"A questioner, scrupulous yet hopeful, a 
teacher of the spirit and doer from the heart," 
such is the characterization of Charles Eliot 
Norton given us by Mr. Edward Waldo Emerson 
in his memorial address before the Archaeolog- 
ical Institute of America at the Toronto meet- 
ing of 1908. This address, together with a 
briefer one by Mr. William Fenwick Harris, is 
now published in a tastefully made volume by 
the Houghton Mifflin Co., and offers a welcome 
foretaste of what awaits us when the official 
biography of that great scholar and good citizen 
shall at last see the light. 

" The written word abides, yet sometimes 
merely on shelves," once said Mr. Norton. It 
was rather by the spoken word, reinforced by 
the engaging personality of the speaker, that 
Norton influenced his contemporaries, and made 
them feel that he approached as closely as 
was humanly possible to that ideal type of the 
American gentleman which most of us cherish 
in the secret chambers of the heart. To count- 
less men of the younger generation he seemed 
the ripe scholar, the wise counsellor, and the 
perfect friend, who embodied all the virtues best 
worth emulating, and his example stood forth as 
the fine flower of the great democratic experi- 
ment in which are centred the fairest hopes of 
mankind. It will be difficult for a future gen- 
eration to realize all that Norton meant to those 
who were his contemporaries, and who were 
mentally and spiritually fitted to appreciate 



428 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



the unerring taste and unfailing sanity that 
informed his outlook upon art and life. The 
printed page has preserved only a fraction of 
the utterances which constituted his influence, 
and even those are so scattered, in periodicals 
and in the books to which he contributed edi- 
torial matter, as to be inconvenient of access. 
No better service could be done the future than 
that of collecting these fugitive pages, and in- 
cluding them within the covers of two or three 
volumes. 

Of Norton's sincere kindness and unselfish 
desire to be helpful, many instances are treas- 
ured by those who knew him. The following 
are given by Mr. Emerson: 

"He kindly came to our little farming village, as 
Concord was forty years ago, to tell us about Turner 
in our Lyceum, and, unasked, not only brought ten of 
Turner's water-color sketches and bade me hang them 
in our public library for a week; but, hearing that two 
or three boys and girls had tried to copy them, wrote 
' keep them a fortnight longer.' For a further instance 
of his great generosity, let me record that once, hearing 
of some one in Portland, Maine, who cared for Turner, 
he packed up and sent several of his own pictures 
thither. The great Portland fire came and destroyed 
them all." 

Mr. Harris gives us these further instances : 

" Professor George Herbert Palmer once told me a 
charming story which well illustrates the desire to serve 
and the kindliness of which I have spoken. In prepar- 
ing the text for his edition of the poet whose name he 
bears, Palmer found it necessary to use the first edition 
of Herbert's works, but a copy was not to be had, although 
Quaritch, who is supposed to find anything, was author- 
ized to offer an extravagant price for it. Learning that 
Norton possessed a copy, Palmer with some trepidation 
ventured to ask if he might use it for a day or so. Mr. 
Norton was leaving for his summer home at Ashfield, but 
nothing must do but Palmer should take the book for 
the summer. When not in use the treasure was carefully 
locked away in a safe, and was returned the day the 
owner came back from Ashfield. Mr. Norton listened 
with great interest to Palmer's account of the profit he 
had had from the book. Next morning the latter found 
a neat packet in his hall, with a note to this effect in 
Mr. Norton's exquisite handwriting: 

'Mr DEAR PALMER: I realized last night after you 
had gone, that this book belongs to you rather than to 
me. Will you please accept it ? ' 

"Another story, one of many, illustrates the same 
qualities. A young instructor in Cambridge was keenly 
anxious to possess a certain book of rarity and price. 
Norton had a copy, and knew the younger man's desires. 
Meeting the instructor one day upon the street, Norton 
remarked quite casually, 'I have just seen a copy of your 
book at the Cooperative, and at a very reasonable price.' 
No time was lost in the purchase. It was only long 
afterwards that the happy possessor realized how strange 
it was that such a book should be in such a place at 
such a price." 

These anecdotes serve to show how generously 
he gave himself and his possessions to thos^ who 



were merely acquaintances or less than that. 
How he gave himself to the elect among his 
friends, to Ruskin and Carlyle and Clough and 
Stephen andFitzGerald and Lowell, may be read 
in the correspondence and journals of these men. 
Truly he had, like such men as Stedman and 
Howells, a genius for friendship. 

Norton's undeviating advocacy of righteous- 
ness in public affairs, fearlessly undertaken 
when it meant opposition to popular clamor, 
made him a mark for the criticism of mean and 
malicious persons, and he suffered not a little 
from their attacks. He was called un-American 
because he championed the merit system in the 
civil service, and opposed the spirit of imperial- 
ism which so fatally undermined our national 
principles after the war with Spain. He could 
not "keep his ear to the ground," which he 
characterized as " surely not the attitude most 
favorable to catch the message from on high." 
He was called a pessimist because he would not 
admit that all was for the best in our triumph- 
ant democracy, and " was impatient of optim- 
ism, being too sensitive to the evils of his day, 
public and private, and the dangers already 
looming even over America as results of low 
standards in politics, in trade, in culture, in con- 
duct, to be content in waiting for things to work 
out right in secular time." He was too passion- 
ate an idealist to observe these tendencies in 
silence. He lived in a time when, as he once 
wrote to a friend, " the advocates of culture and 
the maintenance of morality in politics find their 
best type in Mrs. Partington. At any rate, let 
us use our brooms as briskly as we can till the 
tide quite drowns us out." He never lost his 
faith in a spiritual purpose in the world, work- 
ing " darkly, but O for good, for good," and 
never expressed that faith more strikingly than 
when, not long before his death, he told a friend 
that " if his life were to be lived again, he should 
like to live in Chicago, because he seemed to see 
working there, through the vulgarity and com- 
mercialism necessarily found in a young and 
prospering American town, a power for good, 
which would in time come to its own." 

Mr. Harris, speaking of what Norton did for 
archaeology, quotes a letter from Dr. Holmes re- 
ferring to the work of the Archaeological Insti- 
tute. " It is going to dig up some gods in Greece 
if it can get money enough. I suppose they 
may be required in some quarters to supply an 
apparent want." It was the "apparent want" 
symbolized by the gods of Greece that Norton 
made it his life work to attempt to supply the 
want of reason in our thinking, and righteous-

ness in our public and private conduct, and 
beauty in our daily lives. Quoting Mr. Harris 
once more: 

" That standard of true excellence to which he ever 
held himself, he insisted on for others, and men rallied 
about him all over the country. The simple existence 
of such a man with no private ends to serve, who is 
always ready and willing to tell his fellows the truth, 
and who does it clearly and unflinchingly, is a blessing 
to a community, demanding for its ennobling influence 
a gratitude that cannot be overpaid, stimulating and 
leading men to high achievement, and maintaining those 
qualities of dignity, of skill, and of high ideals which 
were so conspicuous in his own personality." 



CURRENTS AND EDDIES IN THE 
HOLIDAY BOOK FLOOD. 



An attempt to write a treatise on the book harvest 
of this holiday season, a harvest amounting to thou- 
sands of different works, would inevitably leave the 
writer filled with regret that he had not confined his 
attention to a small part of that bewildering whole, 
or even to a single author or volume. The German 
specialist who in his last years lamented that he had 
not devoted his life to one of the Greek particles, 
and not to them all, would have been scandalized at 
the thought of undertaking a survey of the tons of 
books that fall from the printing presses of the world 
in a single season. Yet the making of a few notes 
as one watches from a safe distance the yearly liter- 
ary freshet may be permissible. 

As usual, the great mass of this periodic flood is 
composed of books written or compiled in an honest, 
utilitarian, and wholly uninspired endeavor to pro- 
duce something acceptable to the publisher and not 
distasteful to the reader. Literary skill, scholarly 
industry, abounding resourcefulness, and a keen 
instinct for the timely and for what shall be at least 
transiently interesting, with occasional revelations 
of curious learning or unusual scholarship, are all 
to be noted among the qualities contributing to the 
salability of the printed product, to which also the 
illustrator's art has added its welcome share in full 
measure. This stupendous total of plodding literary 
labor seems to be demanded, year after year, and the 
patient workers are not wanting to the task. One 
is reminded of that great majority among the bees 
and ants which consists of toilers fitted for their 
monotonous duties by certain expert manipulations 
in the pre-natal stage whereby they are enabled to 
perform their laborious part undistracted by the vivid 
emotions and errant impulses necessary to ensure the 
perpetuation of the race. Good workmanlike execu- 
tion, without a gleam of inspiration, and with little 
or nothing of striking originality, is what we find 
in the great mass of printed matter issued in such 
impressive bulk and with so agreeable an accompani- 
ment of exterior ornamentation and pictorial illustra- 
tion, as the annual holiday season approaches. Of 
course no rule is without its conspicuous exceptions, 
and so in the great company of holiday books there 



are, first and last, not a few that deserve to live and 
will live after the season for which they are immedi- 
ately provided is over. Every writer of a Christmas 
book is privileged to hope and does hope that his 
work may prove to be of this enduring sort. 

Ever recurring in the Yuletide literary output are 
the volumes of apt selections pleasantly commemo- 
rating the Christmas season. "Christmas with the 
Poets," "Santa Glaus in Song and Story," "The 
Yule Log in Legend and Tradition" under such 
attractive titles appear, as surely as " Winter comes 
to rule the varied year," a sufficient number of hand- 
somely bound and illustrated volumes which show 
off. well on the drawing-room table and are gladly 
picked up and looked through by the caller waiting 
for my lady's appearance. Almost equally sure of 
publication is the annual volume on happiness, either 
a compilation from standard authors or an independ- 
ent attempt to point the way to that elusive good 
which all the world is ever seeking and rarely holding 
in conscious possession. A considerable contribution 
is also annually made to the "literary landmarks" 
series, books showing diligent reading or at least 
much careful examination of a host of authors, in the 
search for topographical allusions or other matter 
suitable for this class of literary geography. "Lon- 
don in Literature," or "Paris in Poetry," or "His- 
toric Haunts in Hong Kong," may be taken as typical 
forms of the title chosen for this rapidly-growing 
series. Closely allied to it is the travel-book enriched 
with literary references and quotations, a kind of 
book that could be written without going outside the 
four walls of one's library, and probably is some- 
times so written, arm-chair travels, in short, both 
as to writer and reader. 

At an appreciable remove from this general class 
of geographic-literary works stands the never-failing 
book of more or less matter-of-fact travel, a kind of 
literature that in these days must be either descrip- 
tive of strange lands, if there be any such still left, or 
the chronicle of journey ings in familiar lands under 
unusual conditions. "A Year with the Yookaghir 
Tribes," as a hypothetic example, would seem to 
promise more of novelty than "Our Summer in 
Switzerland"; and "Ballooning in the Balkans" or 
" Aeroplaning in the Andes " or "Across the Pacific 
in a Canoe " should offer more excitement than " Six 
Weeks in Europe " or " My Trip to Bermuda." The 
Tailed Head-Hunters of Borneo, and other Head- 
Hunters, presumably tailless, in the Philippines, have 
recently excited some curiosity among hardy explor- 
ers and novelty-seeking readers, and at least three 
substantial volumes, one English and two American, 
have very lately testified to this awakened interest. 
Of country-life books and nature-study books the 
already generous supply is this year still further 
increased, but with some moderation of zeal on the 
part of the so-called nature-fakirs. In the depart- 
ment of reprints, the sumptuously-illustrated holiday 
edition is every year becoming more conspicuous. 
Striking and often beautiful cover-designs, such as 
were unknown twenty years ago, and colored illus-

trations, often astonishing in their combination of 
gaudy hues, but of late showing marked artistic 
improvement, make their vehement appeal to the 
eye on every book-counter. 

In the struggle for existence, a book published 
in these crowded days often owes much of its suc- 
cess or failure to its title. The invention of new and 
striking book-titles is becoming daily more difficult, 
though the rapid growth of our vocabulary helps to 
relieve the embarrassment. A short and apt and 
attention-compelling name every book that hopes for 
popular success must have. A title in fifteen or 
twenty lines, such as pleased our leisurely ancestors 
would not now be tolerated. For brevity nothing 
could well surpass the title of a current novel which 
calls itself "Who?" Another is entitled "C Q," 
self-explanatory and briefer than " The Wireless 
Man," which appears on the cover of another novel 
of the season. Familiar and even stale by this time 
is the title of which "The Rejuvenescence of Reho- 
boam " (though there is no such book) may be taken 
as the type. Not very dissimilar in form, and not 
unsuccessful in its appeal to curiosity, is the actual 
title, "The Woman of It." Among other rather 
unusual book-names this year may be noted the 
following, " Cease Firing," " Why Women are So," 
"Do Something! Be Something !"" Around the 
Clock in Europe," " Martha-by-the-Day," and, beau- 
tifully descriptive of a collection of poems, "A Dome 
of Many-Coloured Glass." Between " C Q " and 
" Hevy News of an horryble Erthquake which was 
in the Citie of Scarbaria, Morocco. In the present 
yere of xlii. The xiii. day of June. And also how 
that a Citie in Turky is sonke," there stretch nearly 
three and three-quarters centuries of development in 
the art of book-making and book-naming. Intoler- 
ably long and wearisome and taxing to the memory 
would those sixteenth-century book-titles be to us 
now ; and unendurably abbreviated and whimsical 
and absurd would many of those of our day have 
seemed to our great-great-great-grandfathers. What 
book fashions, in respect to the minor details here 
briefly touched upon, the next three or four centuries 
shall develop, no man now living can even remotely 
conjecture. 

On the whole, the season's literary stream leaves 
with the beholder sitting on the bank an impression 
of surprising volume and a disposition to wonder 
where all those tumbling waters will finally empty 
themselves. Also an image remains of the fresh- 
ness and sparkle of many a ripple on the flood's 
surface, and at the same time a sense of calmer and 
stronger currents underneath, with a consciousness 
of the inevitable sediment that all great bodies of 
flowing water carry along for a while until it settles 
to its long rest on the ocean's bottom. And so 
the literary, like the physiographic, circulation goes 
ceaselessly on, year after year, bringing health and 
happiness and renewed life, and insuring against 
stagnation, mephitis, and their attendant ills. 

PERCY F. 



CAS UAL COMMENT. 

GERHART HAUPTMANN'S VARIETY IN UNITY is 
emphasized by Professor Edward Everett Hale in 
a study, contributed to the Boston "Transcript," 
of the German playwright to whom has just been 
awarded the 1912 Nobel Prize for literature. 
" Hauptmann is always Hauptmann," we are as- 
sured, but his methods of expression have a Protean 
diversity. " He does not, like some artists, grad- 
ually develop a form, a manner, a style by which 
we may know him. Zola perfects a method and a 
theory ; we need not say he is always alike, but 
certainly his work is all of a piece. Henry James's 
later work differs from his earlier, but it is all a 
clear development and each step seems natural 
enough in view of the one before. George Meredith 
perfects his wonderful instrument and accustoms us 
to it. It is not so with all. Stevenson was always 
experimenting. One can never guess what Anatole 
France will produce. The leading dramatists of our 
day have usually held to a few resembling forms. . . . 
Maeterlinck, it is true, has written all kinds of things. 
But not even Maeterlinck has written in so many 
forms as Hauptmann. Hauptmann himself adds to 
the sense of diversity by giving curious names to his 
dramatic forms, a social drama, a thieves' comedy, 
a dream poem, a fairy tale play, a dramatic poem, 
a glass-house fairy tale, a Berlin tragi-comedy 
these terms are not exactly the names of literary 
forms, but they certainly signify very different 
things." The writer finds, what perhaps few would 
look for, points of resemblance between the subject 
of his essay and Byron, and his study concerns itself 
with various other matters of interest to admirers of 
the German playwright. 

FOGGY IMPRESSIONS OF ENGLISH AUTHORS are 
possessed by even maturer students than the fifty 
first-year college girls who, according to a writer 
in "The School World," were subjected to a simple 
test of their knowledge of the classic literature of 
their own tongue, and were found surprisingly de- 
ficient in the mere elements of the subject. A list 
of writers was given, comprising Chaucer, Shake- 
speare, Spenser, Ben Jonson, Milton, Dryden, Pope, 
Dr. Johnson, Fielding, Coleridge, Wordsworth, 
Byron, Keats, Scott, Jane Austen, Dickens, Thack- 
eray, George Eliot, Rossetti, Matthew Arnold, 
Tennyson, and Browning, and it was required to 
place each in his or her half-century and name 
one of each writer's works. The chronology of the 
answers was amazing, Shakespeare being placed by 
some as late as the last half of the eighteenth cen- 
tury, and even in the first half of the nineteenth, 
Milton anywhere from the thirteenth to the nine- 
teenth, and Wordsworth and Tennyson as far back 
as the sixteenth, with Chaucer ranging over nearly 
the whole of the Christian era. But all the 
girls were safe when it came to naming a work 
by Shakespeare and one by Milton, while forty 
were equally at home with their Chaucer, Scott, Ten- 



1912.] 



THE DIAL 



431 



Tennyson, Thackeray, Dickens, and George Eliot. 
Thirty showed the same familiarity with Spenser, 
Pope, and Wordsworth. But all these names were 
on the list of college entrance requirements. Ben 
Jonson, Fielding, and Rossetti, however, not being 
on the list, were correctly placed by only three 
girls. When it came to naming the authors of cer- 
tain designated works, varying degrees of ignorance 
were displayed, four-fifths of the students being able 
to place the "Canterbury Tales," "Faerie Queene," 
"King Lear," "In Memoriam," and "The Mill on 
the Floss," but only one knowing the authorship of 
"Adonais," while other titles evoked a variety of 
random guesses. What wonder that the critics 
of our system of education charge us with encour- 
aging vagueness and superficiality in the learner? 

RESPECT FOB LITERARY PROPERTY prevails among 
men and women of honor, and stays the hand from 
plagiarism, piracy, the stealing of ideas, and similar 
practices. There is also another kind of respect for 
literary property, a respect that will bear further 
cultivation, especially among freauenters of public 
libraries. This respect, it will at once be surmised, 
is the feeling that forbids the mutilation, defacement, 
or theft of books, periodicals, or other reading mat- 
ter provided by the library for public use and enjoy- 
ment. Reference was recently made in these col- 
umns to the indefensible practice of marking favorite 
passages in books not one's own. Familiar to all is 
the juvenile prank, which seems to the small person 
so immensely clever and amusing, of writing on the 
fly-leaf, or on an early page, " If my name you wish 
to see, look on page two hundred and three," with 
a similar rhyme on the designated page referring 
the reader to another page, and so on until the circle 
is complete, and the young vandal hugs himself with 
glee at the thought of the seeker's fruitless search 
for his (the vandal's) valuable autograph. No 
amount of legislation, no system of police will ever 
completely cure, or even very greatly diminish, evils 
of this sort. A stub of a pencil, or a small pen-knife, 
held concealed in the hand, can accomplish unlimited 
mischief under the very eyes of the official in charge 
of a reading-room or reference-room or other pub- 
licly accessible department of a library, and to catch 
the culprit red-handed is rarely possible. Of course 
the remedy lies in a quickening of the public con- 
science, a fostering of the sense of what is seemly, 
a realization of the stupidity and brutishness of all 
acts that disregard the rights of others. Travellers 
in Japan tell of beautiful carved fences that border 
the public road and yet remain permanently unmu- 
tilated by destroying jack-knives. In this country 
the carving on public fences is done by the ubiqui- 
tous small boy, or even by the college student, and 
takes chiefly the form of personal initials and the 
Greek letters designating certain secret societies 
that flourish in schools and colleges. Some day all 
this sort of thing will be universally recognized as 
*' bad form," and as unallowable as a buffet below 
the belt in a boxing-match or at least we hope so. 



WHAT GREAT AUTHORS PRIDE THEMSELVES ON 
is by no means always their best writings, or even 
their writings at all. What one does easily and 
naturally and well has a way of seeming less admir- 
able to the performer than a painfully and imper- 
fectly executed piece of work for which he is not 
suited. That is probably one reason why so many 
authors and artists of assured fame have longed to 
win laurels in walks of life to which their feet did 
not naturally turn. In this connection it is interest- 
ing to note a little peculiarity of Guy de Maupassant's 
as recorded in a reminiscent article by an intimate 
woman friend of his, in " La Grande Revue." He 
was proud of his physical strength, says the writer, 
and liked to speak about it ; and she recalls his lift- 
ing her by her belt and holding her at arm's length, 
and also his walking laughingly across the room with 
a heavy arm-chair in each hand. She even believes 
he prided himself more on this muscular dexterity 
than on his literary genius. This may remind the 
reader of Dr. Holmes's unfeigned delight in the bits 
of wood-work or cabinet-making with which he varied 
the monotony of literary composition, keeping a set 
of tools in one of his desk drawers for such recrea- 
tional uses. The recent biography of Mark Twain 
shows him to have prided himself on his mathemat- 
ical talent, though he commonly arrived at an incor- 
rect result in his laborious calculations. In one of 
these self-imposed exercises in later life he figured 
out his own pecuniary liabilities as twice what they 
actually were, and passed a wakeful night in conse- 
quence; but his delight on discovering his error in 
the morning seems to have more than made up for 
the loss of sleep. At another time we find him calcul- 
ating the number of light-years separating us from 
Alpha Centauri, and the figures, reproduced in fac- 
simile, are certainly impressive, whatever other quali- 
ties they may lack. 

GENIUS AND PERSONALITY are rightly associated 
together. The theory of impersonal genius, whereby 
a great epic (like the "Iliad " or the " Odyssey ") can 
come into being spontaneously without any assign- 
able authorship, has by this time been pretty well ex- 
ploded, although Wolf for a long while made the 
greater part of the academic world believe that a 
brew of commonplace minds could somehow, if left 
to simmer long enough, take on the flavor of trans- 
cendent genius. Those who have never allowed 
themselves to be overawed or convinced by the array 
of Teutonic learning in support of the conglomerate 
authorship of Homer's poems can now congratulate 
themselves as they see the learned world coming 
around again to their own position. The first chapter 
of Mr. Chamberlain's masterly book, "The Founda- 
tions of the Nineteenth Century," contains some pas- 
sages that will please them. The late Andrew Lang 
was one of the sturdiest believers in Homer, and 
also in Shakespeare. A posthumous work of his, 
announced for publication, indicates by its table of 
contents the attitude of the writer toward th ti- 
Shakespeare school. " Shakespeare, Bacon, the 



432 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



Great Unknown " is the book's title, and its chapters 
deal with the Baconian and anti- William positions, 
the "silence " about Shakespeare, that impossible He, 
the schooling of Shakespeare, Mr. Churton Collins 
on Shakespeare's learning, contemporary recognition 
of Will as an author, the later life of Shakespeare, the 
preoccupations of Bacon, and other kindred topics. 
Nevertheless, there will probably always be disbeliev- 
ers in the Shakespearean authorship of the plays, just 
as there will always be disbelievers in the rotundity 
of the earth. ... 

THE DEMOLITION OF A FAMOUS LIBRARY BUILD- 
ING will begin about Christmas time, when Gore Hall 
will have ceased to shelter the library of Harvard 
University and will yield place to the magnificent 
structure given by Mrs. Widener in memory of her 
son, Harry E. Widener (Harvard '07), who at his 
death in the wreck of the "Titanic" left his fine 
collection of books to his alma mater. The removal 
of the books from Gore Hall has for some time been 
going on at the rate of about fifty thousand volumes 
a week ; but as the entire library numbers somewhat 
over a million volumes (though not all housed to- 
gether) the work of transfer to temporary quarters 
in other college buildings is no speedy process. It 
was to the generosity of Christopher Gore, seventh 
governor of Massachusetts, that Harvard owed its 
once greatly-admired library building which was first 
occupied in 1841, fourteen years after Gore's death 
and his bequest of two hundred thousand dollars to 
the college in Cambridge. In those intervening years 
the corporation had deliberately and wisely deter- 
mined to erect a building that should be fire-proof 
and " in material and architecture an enduring mon- 
ument to the memory of the most munificent of all 
the benefactors of the University ; . . . since the 
security, the capacity, and the means of convenient 
arrangement and display which such a building 
affords would be among the more powerful induce- 
ments to intelligent and liberal minds to contribute 
toward filling its alcoves and enlarging its useful- 
ness." In the short space of a quarter-century what 
had seemed so vast an emptiness was crowded with 
books, and ever since then, despite additions to the 
structure, the congestion has been growing more pro- 
nounced. It is pleasant to learn that the name and 
memory of Christopher Gore will be perpetuated in 
one of the three freshmen dormitories about to arise 
on the bank of the Charles River, somewhat apart

ANCIENT SERVIAN POETRY is of a richness and 
beauty suspected by few. One of the marked char- 
acteristics of this gallant people that has been so 
sturdily contending for its national independence is 
its imagination, its poetic temperament, as Professor 
Pupin of Columbia University, honorary Servian 
consul at New York, is reported recently as saying. 
It is wonderful and admirable that a race deprived 
of education during five centuries of Moslem oppres- 
sion, and robbed of all knowledge of its ancient liter- 
ary language, should still be able to preserve in the 



form of folklore and verse of extraordinary beauty 
the details of every important event in its history. 
Goethe is said to have learned the old Servian tongue 
in order to gain access to this rich mine of native 
poetry so little worked by scholars and writers, though 
it appears that the University of Vienna has lately 
caused several hundred thousand lines of this poetry 
to be translated into German. The Servian minstrel, 
old and blind, perhaps, or supporting himself on 
crutches, is a not unfamiliar sight, making his way 
with his one-stringed lute from place to place and 
singing to the peasants the brave deeds of their fore- 
fathers. It is not strange, by the way, that the peo- 
ple object to being called Servians, which suggests 
a derivation from the Latin servus, a slave. They 
wish to be known as free and independent Serbs. 

A CERVANTES MUSEUM has been established, or 
at least started, at Valladolid, where the house 
once occupied by the author of "Don Quixote," 
together with the two adjoining houses, has been 
bought by King Alfonso out of his private purse, 
and Cervantes rel|cs and souvenirs will there be col- 
lected and preserved. As in Homer's case, seven 
cities have contended for the honor of having given 
to the world the greatest of Spanish writers, but 
Valladolid is not one of these seven. Soon after 
the beginning of the seventeenth century Cervantes 
is believed to have lived there a few years and to- 
have written there a part of his most famous 
work, whose first publication dates back to 1605.. 
Alcalii de Henares, as everyone knows, is the for- 
tunate city now conceded to have given birth to this- 
great contemporary of our Shakespeare. The tradi- 
tion of their dying both on the same day one likes to- 
regard as history and to set side by side with the famil- 
iar story of the almost simultaneous death of Adama- 
and Jefferson though apart from the element of- 
curious coincidence there is nothing to connect the- 
two traditions. ... 

A USE FOR OLD SCHOOLBOOKS which might other- 
wise be thrown into the fire or on the rubbish heap, 
should be brought to the attention of those whose 
attics are rich in these interesting reminders of the- 
little red schoolhouse or the old-fashioned village - 
academy. The United States Bureau of Education 
is forming what it hopes will be the best pedagogical 1 
library in the world; indeed, it already is the best,, 
containing about seventy thousand volumes on the 
subject of education, and eighty thousand pam- 
phlets, reports, periodicals, and other miscellaneous- 
matter not in bound book form, all freely accessible 
to the public and, under certain restrictions, open to 
general circulation. The department of school text- 
books in the principal European languages ne^,,*- 
sarily has many yawning gaps, and it is in the hope- 
of reducing these gaps that Commissioner Claxton . 
asks for gifts of such old books of this class as may 
be lurking unused and unregarded in dusty lofts 
and obscure corners. The Government has always- 
been liberal in its policy of sending out its publica* 
tions wherever desired, and it now hopes the people-

will respond with like generosity in helping to equip 
the educational library with such material of the 
above-named sort as may be available. 

A HINT FROM QUINTILIAN, whose "Institutiones 
Oratoriae " are not now much read even by classical 
students, is conveyed to those desirous of perfecting 
their literary style and enlarging their vocabulary, 
by a writer in the current "Hibbert Journal" who 
makes a study of ancient and modern methods of 
education, with the Roman rhetorician for a text. 
After quoting Quintilian's advice to read the ancient 
Latin authors, first because they supply a fine liter- 
ary vocabulary, and secondly because they are models 
in the arrangement of their matter so as to instruct 
and inform by orderly sequence and not by clever 
phrase-making alone, the writer continues: "Quin- 
tilian's lesson for us to-day, then, would be Receive 
gratefully the large heritage of language which you 
have received from your literary predecessors, and 
study it by progressive stages, and employ its vocab- 
ulary when occasion requires. If an old word ex- 
isted in English say in Elizabethan times hold 
by that word, or re-introduce it, rather than some 
modern catchword spawned by slang or perverted 
from Cockney French." Or, to put this more briefly 
in our own words (and Milton's), cultivate the habit 
of avoiding such terms and phrases as would have 
made Quintilian stare and gasp. 

THE TWO LATEST FRENCH ACADEMICIANS, Gen- 
eral Lyautey, conqueror of Morocco, and Professor 
Emile Boutroux, philosopher and author of "Le Moi 
Subliminal" and other works, including a notable 
preface to the French edition of William James's 
"Varieties of Religious Experience," present a pleas- 
ing contrast to the mind's eye and illustrate in their 
dissimilar personalities the broad catholicity of judg- 
ment that, in this instance at least, has placed them 
both among the Immortals. Yet it should not be 
inferred that General Lyautey is exclusively a man 
of arms and of warlike deeds. He handles the 
pen, it appears, with as much dexterity as the 
sword. Two articles of his in the "Revue des 
Deux Mondes " (one entitled " Du Role Colonial de 
1'ArmeV' the other, "Du Role Social de 1'Officier") 
have won warm praise, and, apart from their sub- 
stance, are said to be well worth reading "merely 
as literature." Professor Boutroux's early work on 
"The Contingency of Natural Laws," his thesis for 
the doctor's degree in 1874, was a vigorous assault 
on the then prevalent doctrine of determinism, and 
it marked him as a thinker of originality and force. 

THE VIGOROUS GROWTH OF LIBRARY CATALOGUES, 
u. ir rapid increase in physical dimensions, especially 
when they take the form of card-catalogues, as they 
commonly, and wisely, now do, is something rather 
disturbing to the mental peace of a librarian already 
cramped for space in the upbuilding of the institu- 
tion under his charge. Some one has facetiously 
forecast the time when the card-catalogues of the 
Boston Public Library and the Harvard Library 



will meet on the bridge over the Charles (known as 
the Harvard bridge) and special conveyances will 
be provided for those desiring to consult distant 
drawers in this five-mile catalogue of the two famous 
collections. But even the compactness of a printed 
catalogue does not by any means make a large li- 
brary's catalogue a volume for the pocket. This is 
forcibly brought to mind by an announcement from 
the State University of Iowa (in a neat little "Hand- 
book of the Library ") that it "has just strengthened 
its bibliographical collection by the addition of the 
British Museum catalog of printed books," a work 
extending to some ninety large volumes and still 
growing. The contemplation of those serried ranks 
brings home to one the truth of that hackneyed 
quotation from " Eeclesiastes," xn., 12. 



COMMUNICATIONS, 



"THE PERIL OF EXTERNALISM." 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I beg your permission to file my objections to your 
recent editorial on " The Peril of Externalism," based 
upon a recent paper by Professor Joseph Jastrow on 
" The Administrative Peril in Education." What you 
say, and what Professor Jastrow has said, is what has 
been said by others. But it seems to me to lack founda- 
tion in fact, or at least, it represents a widespread 
state of things from which there are many exceptions. 
It may be true that " externalism," as you term it, fails 
to attract strong men to the profession of teaching and 
that it does not foster a vigorous intellectual life in our 
universities. It is true that there are institutions with- 
out strong men and with conditions hampering to free- 
dom of thought and expression. But is this due solely 
or chiefly to the method of administration ? And it is 
true also that there are institutions manned by robust 
scholars who enjoy complete freedom. The latter group 
may be smaller than the former, but it exists. I speak 
from intimate personal knowledge, for I have had the 
honor of holding a chair in an institution of this high 
character for nearly a quarter of a century. And yet 
this institution is governed by a self-perpetuating board 
of trustees; it has a president who does not hesitate to 
exercise authority; and its administration seems to con- 
form to the method you hold to be harmful. In theory 
the ultimate power over everything is absolutely in the 
hands of the trustees; and sovereignty must be lodged 
somewhere. In practise every one of the separate schools 
has its owu faculty and is expected to control its own 
internal affairs. The department to which I belong is 
substantially autonomous; that is to say that we recom- 
mend men for vacant chairs and for promotion, our 
recommendations being always accepted by the presi- 
dent and by the trustees who also deal with us as liberally 
as the finances of the university will permit. In theory 
this may be autocracy; in practise it is democracy. 

I find in your article this quotation from Professor 
Jastrow : 

"Prosperity is statistically measured; hence the desire 
for more buildings and costly ones ; for more instructors, 
many of them occupied in work that the college should re- 
quire and not provide ; and more and more students who must 
be attracted toward the local Athenopolis and away from the 
rival one ; accordingly the hills are all reduced to easy grades 
and new democratic (not royal) roads to learning are laid out

for those who do not like the old ones. Requirements are set 
not to what collegians should learn but to what they will ; as 
at the circus the strip of bunting is held ostentatiously high 
until the horse with its fair burden is about to jump, when it is 
inconspicuously accommodated to the possible performance." 
Again I admit that there may be institutions of this 
sort; but if they exist, I should like to know their 
names. I think that the time has come for a bill of par- 
ticulars. I crave more specification and less declamation. 
At the institution which I know best the conditions are 
the reverse of this. Buildings continue to be erected, 
provided always by special gift and never out of the free 
funds of the corporation. Students also increase in 
numbers, but not as a result of any lowering of stand- 
ards. On the contrary, these standards have been 
steadily raised in the several professional schools, every 
one of which now requires two or three years of college 
work as a prerequisite for admission, and every one of 
which is making severer demands upon the students 
after they are admitted. In the college itself there has 
been a steady improvement in the students ; they work 
now, most of them, as very few of my classmates worked 
when I was an undergraduate. They are alert, intelli- 
gent, interested. They are in fact the exact opposite of 
those described in another passage that you quote from 
Professor Jastrow: 

" Students have no intellectual interests, no applications, 
no knowledge of essentials, no ability to apply what they 
assimilate; they are flabby, they dawdle, they fritter and 
frivol, they contemn the grind, they seek proficiency in stunts, 
they drift to the soft and circumvent the hard; undertrained 
and overtaught, they are coddled and spoon-fed and served 
where they should be serving; and they get their degrees for a 
quality of work which in an office would cost them their jobs." 

I have visited a score of American colleges east and 
west; and nowhere have I met undergraduates of this 
type. If Professor Jastrow actually knows a single 
institution harboring such creatures, he owes it to the 
cause of education in the United States to step forward 
frankly and let us know its name. 
November 20, 191S. AN AMERICAN PROFESSOR. 

CULTURE AND SOCIALISM. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

While every thoughtful reader of the editorial in 
your last issue must agree with Dr. Andrews as to the 
present condition of our spiritual health, I venture to 
think that there are many who will take decided excep- 
tion to much of his reasoning. 

In the first place, a conception of culture narrowed 
down to an " appreciation of the non-economic values " 
leaves something to be desired. There have been, and 
are to-day, persons of not wholly contemptible intellect 
who maintain that ethical and aesthetic values are 
almost inseparably interwoven with economic and social 
values, that, indeed, the advance of economic forces 
has always been the base of cultural and religious 
no less than of political and social progress. But even 
disregarding this view, is it anything less than ludicrous 
to look for " appreciation of the non-economic values " 
in a civilization such as ours is to-day where economic 
values are so all-pervading and all-powerful ? 

Dr. Andrews is quite obviously a thorough-going indi- 
vidualist, and as such it is no doubt comforting to him 
to think of socialism as a rigid economic theory standing 
rooted to-day where it stood a half-century ago, being 
of those who, as Miss Scudder says, " find it more con- 
venient and more consonant with prejudices of which 
they are unaware, to accept the blatantly materialistic 



tone of some current socialism at face value as represen- 
tative of the whole movement." Socialism, to him, is 
" a crusade against the highlands of men's life in the 
supposed interest of the bog"; "it is essentially a 
gospel of materialism, and its root appeal is to greed"; 
it would " build forth the social body utterly without 
regard to heterogeneity." Now I think it is no less 
than the truth to say that socialism, as the majority of 
its adherents understand it to-day, is the exact and 
polar opposite of all these things. It is, if it is any- 
thing at all, a crusade to rescue mankind from the bog, 
and give him his chance at the highlands; instead of 
being a gospel of greed, it is an organized revolt against 
greed; free play for the development of heterogeneity 
is one of its primary and basic purposes. 

Except in the consciousness of a few irreconcilables, 
the old warfare between socialism and individualism is 
in fact at an end. Few things are more clear to an open 
and rational mind than that not only are the two con- 
ceptions not antagonistic, but that each is essential and 
complementary to the other. As Oscar Wilde remarked, 
over twenty years ago, socialism is of value simply be- 
cause it leads to individualism. " We socialize what we 
call our physical life," says Mr. Havelock Ellis, "in 
order that we may attain greater freedom for what we 
call our spiritual life." The class-conscious revolution- 
ary socialism of Karl Marx is to-day as obsolete as the 
violent, almost insane individualism of his contemporary, 
Max Stirner. In the place of these we now have a great 
far-reaching system of social moralization and regenera- 
tion that promises to every individual a rational hope of 
freedom and self-realization. 

If we reject that hope, what other is there? Perhaps 
it should be sufficient for us to know, as a writer in your 
last issue tells us, that " reason is slowly but surely work- 
ing out its triumph over unreason in the ordering of 
human affairs," and we should rest content in the con- 
templation of that automatic and beautiful process. But 
there are some persons, like Mr. Wells, who prefer not 
to wait, who prefer doing what they can to hasten mat- 
ters along a bit. And even were we all to wait, in serene 
and confident inaction, what would become of culture 
meanwhile? For as surely as it is impossible to gather 
grapes from thorns and figs from thistles is it impossible 
that sound culture should spring from the conditions of 
economic restraint and social wrong in which we live. 
What William Morris said of art is equally true of all 
cultural activity, " it has no chance of a healthy life, 
or, indeed, of a life at all, till we are on the way to fill 
up the terrible gulf between riches and poverty." And 
until that gulf is filled, what ethical right have any of 
us, however exempt from the common lot our own lives 
happen to be, to devote ourselves to the concerns of 
abstract culture? We know what choice Ruskin and 
Tolstoy and Morris made when it came to a decision 
between cloistered culture and social warfare; and in 
the aggravated conditions of our own day, their choice 
is far more emphatically incumbent upon us. 

Nowadays " there is wide remission of enthusiasm for 
humanity," thinks Dr. Andrews. He is doubtless right; 
but such enthusiasm for humanity as does exist will be 
found in largest part among those who, whether or not 
they call themselves socialists, are yet fighting the good 
fight for all that present-day socialism represents and 
embodies. And until that fight is won, it is idle to look 
for anything other than a constantly accelerating decline 
of culture. 3. R. WILTON.

MR. BENNETT VISITS AMERICA.* 



Quite as extraordinary as Mr. Arnold Ben- 
nett's delicate and masterly manipulation of one 
type of fiction is his facility at any sort of lit- 
erary work. He has edited a woman's magazine 
with success and relish. He can turn out a best- 
seller with dispatch, and a play with inconceiv- 
able celerity. His advice to the man in the 
street on the conservation of leisure moments 
has exactly that happy mingling of commonplace 
and suggestiveness that the man in the street 
craves. 

And so, when Mr. Bennett visited America 
last winter, to see and to be seen, it was inevi- 
table that his retrospective impressions should 
be promptly forthcoming, as promised ; and that 
they should be, in quality, competent, spicy, of 
a carefully measured depth and a carefully 
determined cogency. Being of a highly unemo- 
tional temperament, Mr. Bennett never over- 
reaches himself. Everything that he has written, 
including " Your United States," is a completely 
unified product. When Mr. Bennett decides to 
skim the surface of an experience, he does so 
thoroughly and with deftness, without illusions 
about the importance of his occupation, and with 
no disconcerting dips below or flights above to 
mar the symmetry of his achievement. In short, 
Mr. Bennett has a feeling for " key " that, in 
the almost appalling variety of his literary pro- 
duct, keeps each group peculiarly distinct and 
makes it very difficult to amalgamate them all 
in any general estimate of the man. Taken 
individually, you may scorn all his works ; 
but, as the psychological phenomenon that pro- 
duced them, Mr. Bennett is truly to be won- 
dered at. 

" Your United States " is naturally under- 
taken in lighter mood. Mr. Bennett's stay 
among us was of the briefest. In due course 
he visited New York, Boston, Chicago, Phila 
delphia, Washington, and Indianapolis, which 
latter city he refers to unquestionably as at pres- 
ent our chief literary centre. Everywhere that 
he went, but particularly in Indianapolis, he had 
friends old friends, that is, besides the enthu- 
siastic crowds of would-be acquaintance that 
beset his path. Under their efficient guidance 
he savoured the quality of our hotels and our

home life, travelled, and went sight-seeing, 
except in Washington, where, escaping from 
control, he insisted upon " doing " the Capitol 
building in thirty minutes, as a slight but suit- 
able retaliation upon Americans for their cur- 
sory treatment of the sacred sights of Europe. 
Mr. Bennett was so exhausted by this magnifi- 
cent feat that he refused to look at anything 
more in Washington save such of the streets 
and avenues of the city as he could view peace- 
fully from the " sea-going hack " that had taken 
him to the Capitol. 

Now it is rather difficult to believe that the 
sophisticated and brilliant Mr. Bennett, sea- 
soned resident of London and Paris, and familiar 
of other European capitals, found the diversion 
that he professes in his " Cook's view " of Wash- 
ington, just as it is difficult to believe that he 
was as completely overwhelmed as he would 
appear by the glories of the "Lusitania," or as 
bewildered by the crookedness of Boston; that 
he stood awe-struck before Lowell's study 
windows, was thrilled with romantic wonder in 
a Chicago mail-order house, or was "positively 
intoxicated" by the glorious spectacle of Fifth 
Avenue at its finest. In other words, we are 
inclined to write down the best parts of Mr. 
Bennett's American impressions as very clever, 
very entertaining, and entirely fictitious. It 
is only one more case of the Bennett astuteness. 
" Who," thought he, " would see this America 
most interestingly? Why, surely the provincial 
Englishman with an imagination that same 
fellow whose romantic impressions of London 
(under my signature) have lately delighted the 
readers of a certain British weekly." It is one 
of Mr. Bennett's cleverest tricks, this ability 
to assume naivete convincingly, to sketch bril- 
liant pastels, emanating romance and mystery, 
of city streets, grand hotels, gay restaurants, 
straggling suburbs ; to make life seem as color- 
ful and wonderful and mystically idealistic as 
it is to the perennial heart of youth. After all, 
what Mr. Bennett frankly and soberly thought 
about America has probably often been thought 
and said before. Indeed there are pages and 
chapters in his book to prove this bits that he 
might well have given to the greedy interviewers 
who swooped down upon him even before he 
had landed on our shores. It is surely a matter 
for gratification that Mr. Bennett's book is not 
merely an extended interview. 

The essential quality of the impressions may 
be caught, as well as anywhere, from the account 
of Mr. Bennett's first sight of New York be- 
ginning after he had entered a " rickety and con-

fined taxi," and mistaken a policeman, " flashing 
forth authority, gaiety, and utter smartness," 
for an archduke. Mr. Bennett continues : 

" The rest of the ride was an enfevered phantas- 
magoria. We burst startingly into a very remarkable 
deep glade on the floor of it long and violent surface- 
cars, a few open shops and bars with commissionaires 
at the doors, vehicles dipping and rising out of holes in 
the ground, vistas of forests of iron pillars, on the top 
of which ran deafening, glittering trains, as on a tight- 
rope ; above all that, a layer of darkness ; and above the 
layer of darkness enormous moving images of things in 
electricity a mastodon kitten playing with a ball of 
thread, an umbrella in a shower of rain, siphons of soda- 
water being emptied and filled, gigantic horses galloping 
at full speed, and an incredible heraldry of chewing- 
gum. . . . Sky-signs! In Europe I had always in- 
veighed manfully against sky-signs. But now I bowed 
the head, vanquished. . . . 'You must not expect me 
to talk,' I said." 

Of course much criticism and opinion is neces- 
sarily included, incidentally to the narration of 
such experiences as this. Mr. Bennett does not, 
for instance, admire our sky-scrapers except as 
symbols ; he dislikes our restaurants, abhors our 
Pullman cars, and sharply arraigns the vaunted 
luxury of our Limited trains ; he discounts our 
sporting spirit, though he approves the technique 
of our national game ; he lauds our standard of 
domestic comfort in home and hotel; he finds 
hopeful signs in our theatres, a lack of the finest 
public spirit in our citizens ; and, finally, he dis- 
covers "the essential America" in "the long, 
calm streets" of Indianapolis, maple-shaded and 
set with the homes of the solid middle class. 

Perhaps it was because Mr. Bennett unex- 
pectedly discovered the essential America in 
Indianapolis that he cut short his intended and 
well-advertised progress to our Western coast; 
or perhaps the terrifically swaying sleeping cars 
deterred him from penetrating beyond Chicago. 
Whatever the reason, the event was fortunate. 
The real Mr. Bennett might have been enter- 
tained and even edified by the sight of other 
phases of the essential America, phases less 
calm and ordered than the streets of Indianap- 
olis, which house, we are told, Victorian ladies 
and old silver tea-things, besides important lit- 
erary pretensions. But there was ample material 
east of the Mississippi to provide Mr. Bennett, 
the author, with romantic adventure, unhappy 
disillusionment, not too poignant to hold possi- 
bilities of humor, and a vivid impression of 
native traits, culminating on the maple-shaded 
streets of Indianapolis. More of our United 
States would have been superfluous. 

Mr. Frank Craig's pictures are as " smart " as 
Mr. Bennett's text, from which they seem to have 
caught the prevailing note of genial, inconse- 



quent picturesqueness. They give the book 
somewhat the appearance of a clever society 
novel an appearance not wholly misleading.

CHAUCBR ix PROSE.* 



Why should we modernize Chaucer to-day? 
Was not Landor right in holding such a project 
to be futile? "I would rather see Chaucer 
quite alone," he wrote, " in the dew of his sunny 
morning, than with twenty clever gentlefolks 
about him, arranging .his shoestrings and but- 
toning his doublet. I like even his language. 
I will have no hand in breaking his dun but 
richly-painted glass to put in (if clearer) much 
thinner panes." In Lander's time, moreover, 
when early English was more like a foreign 
tongue than it is to-day, there was greater need 
of a rendering into the modern idiom than at 
present, when the Globe Edition provides a text 
not difficult to read after a slight acquaintance 
with the language of the fourteenth century. 

The public, however, has taken a different 
view of the question. For two centuries it has 
eagerly bought and presumably read good, bad, 
and indifferent imitations and translations of 
various parts of Chaucer's works. The long list 
of modernizers is virtually headed by Dryden, 
who in his "Fables" (1700) included para- 
phrases of "The Knight's Tale," "The Nun's 
Priest's Tale," "The Wife of Bath's Tale," 
and the character of the Parson. Dryden's 
work found great favor throughout the cen- 
tury ; as late as 1787 Walpole remarked that 
he loved Chaucer better in Dryden and Bask- 
erville f than in his [Chaucer's] own dress and 
language. Closely following Dryden came Pope 
with his "January and May" (1709), his 
"Wife of Bath's Prologue" (1714), and his 
"Temple of Fame," based on "The House of 
Fame" (1715) all polished, artificial, and 
distorted renderings one had better say per- 
versions of their genuinely simple and natural 
originals. The year 1712 saw the publication 
of Betterton's version of "The Reeve's Tale" 
and of most of the Prologue, together with 
Samuel Cobb's "Miller's Tale." The most

ambitious of these Chaucerian undertakings, 
however, was that of George Ogle, who in 1741 
published, in three volumes, " The Canterbury 
Tales Modernized by Several Hands," the heroic 
couplet being used throughout. Poor as some 
of these readings were, a second edition of the 
book was issued in 1742 and a third in 1795, 
the latter edited by William Lipscomb. Words- 
worth modernized "The Prioress' Tale" (1801, 
published in 1821) and "The Manciple's Tale," 
though he never published the latter. Lord 
Thurlow's "Arcita and Palemon" (1822) went 
into a second edition. Leigh Hunt translated 
" The Squire's Tale " twice (1823, 1841), and 
also modernized " The Pardoner's Tale," "The 
Friar's Tale," and "The Manciple's Tale." 
Charles Cowden Clarke's "Riches of Chaucer " 
(1835) remained popular throughout the cen- 
tury, being three times reprinted. A century 
after Ogle came Richard Hengist Home with 
his " Poems of Chaucer Modernized," to which 
contributions were made by Wordsworth, Leigh 
Hunt, and Elizabeth Barrett, and which was 
partially reproduced by J. P. Briscoe as late as 
1901. Saunders's edition of "The Canterbury 
Tales" (1845) has been reprinted at least 
four times. In 1870 two renderings of "The 
Canterbury Tales" were published: Frederick 
Clarke's did not go beyond the first volume, 
but that of Purves, including several others of 
Chaucer's poems, was twice reprinted. The late 
Professor Skeat in his last years translated at 
least ten of " The Canterbury Tales," "The Le- 
gend of Good Women," " The Romaunt of the 
Rose," and the minor poems. Mr. MacKaye 
himself published in 1904 the version of the 
Prologue and ten tales which is here, we believe, 
reproduced; and that this volume had a good 
sale may be inferred from the fact that he 
now joins with Prof essor Tatlock in bringing out 
the first modern English rendering of Chaucer's 
complete works. Many other modernizers are 
mentioned by Miss Hammond in her bibli- 
ography; and it is evident that there was a 
demand for the work of these mediators or 
middle-men since the poorest of it seems to 
have been welcomed by the public.* 

If we are to have a modernization of Chaucer, 
let it be in prose. We doubt if the genius exists 
or ever will arise who could even remotely sug- 
gest, continuously and for any length of time, 
in a contemporary verse rendering, the tone and 
flavor of Chaucer's poetry. It is hard enough 

*For an elaborate criticism of several of these modern- 
izers one should consult Professor Lounsbury's entertaining 
"Studies in Chaucer," iii. 154-240. 



to put any early poet into modern verse, since 
the shifting of the accent toward the beginning 
of words has ruined the language from the point 
of view of facility in rhyme. In spite of this 
handicap some have, to be sure, rendered parts 
of Chaucer in readable verse ; but their attempts 
have not come much nearer to being Chaucer 
than Pope's "Iliad" came to being Homer. A 
quotation or two may illustrate our point. Here 
is Troilus's prayer to Cupid when he finds that 
Criseyde has departed (v. 582 ff.): 

"Than thoughts he thus: 'O blisful Lord Cupide, 
Whan I the proces have in my memorie, 
How thou me hast werrey'd on every side, 
Men might a book make of it, lik a storie! 
What nede is thee to seke on me victorie, 
Sin I am thyn, and hoolly at thy wille ? 
What joye hast thou thine owne folk to spille ? 

" ' Wei hastow, Lord, ywroke on me thyn ire, 
Thou mighty God, and dredful for to greve! 
Now mercy, Lord! Thou wost wel I desire 
Thy grace most of alle lustes leve, 
And live and deye I wol in thy bileve: 
For which I naxe in guerdon but oo bone, 
That thou Criseyde ayein me sende sone. 

" ' Distreyne her herte as faste to retorne 
As thou dost myn to longen her to see: 
Than wot I wel that she nil not sojorne. 
Now, blisful Lord, so cruel thou ne be 
Unto the blood of Troye, I preye thee, 
As Juno was unto the blood Thebane, 
For which the folk of Thebes caughte hir bane!'" 



WORDSWORTH. 

" ' O blissful God of Love ! ' then thus he cried, 
' When I the process have in memory, 
How thou hast wearied me on every side, 
Men thence a book might make, a history; 
What need to seek a conquest over me, 
Since I am wholly at thy will? what joy 
Hast thou thine own liege subjects to destroy? 

" Dread Lord! so fearful when provoked, thine ire 
Well hast thou wreaked on me by pain and grief; 
Now mercy, Lord! thou know'st well I desire 
Thy grace above all pleasures first and chief; 
And live and die I will in thy belief; 
For which I ask for guerdon but one boon, 
That Cresida again thou send me soon. 

" Constrain her heart as quickly to return, 
As thou dost mine with longing her to see, 
Then know I well that she would not sojourn. 
Now, blissful Lord, so cruel do not be 
Unto the blood of Troy, I pray of thee, 
As Juno was unto the Theban blood, 
From whence to Thebes came griefs in multitude.' " 



TATLOCK-MACKAYE. 

" Then he thought, ' O blessed lord Cupid, when I 
remember the history, how thou hast warred against 
me on every side, men might make a book of it like a 
tale. What need hast thou to seek a conquest on me,

since I am thine, wholly at thy will? What joy is it 
to thee to destroy thine own folk? Lord, well hast 
thou wreaked thine ire on me, mighty god, deadly to 
offend! Show mercy now, O lord! Thou knowest well 
I crave thy grace above all dear pleasures, and will live 
and die in thy faith ; in guerdon of which I ask but one 
boon, that thou send me back Criseyde speedily. Let 
her heart long to return as eagerly as mine to see her; 
then I wot well she will not tarry. Blessed lord, I pray 
thee be not so cruel to the blood of Troy as Juno was 
to Theban blood, for which the folk of Thebes had their 
destruction! ' ' 

Wordsworth has here shown great skill in pre- 
serving the original form ; yet. he has mistrans- 
lated werreyed and has given a misleading turn 
to the Jast line. 

For a second illustration we choose the ac- 
count of the stranger knight's entrance in " The 
Squire's Tale ": 

" This strange knyght that cam thus sodeynly, 
Al armed, save his heed, ful richely, 
Saleweth kyng and queene, and lorde's alle, 
By ordre, as they seten in the halle, 
With so heigh reverence and obeisaunce, 
As wel in speche as in contenaunce, 
That Gawayn, with his olde curteisye, 
Though he were comen ageyn out of fairye, 
Ne koude hym not amende with a word; 
And after this, biforn the heighe bord, 
He with a manly voys seith his message 
After the forme used in his langage, 
Withouten vice of silable, or of lettre ; 
And for his tale sholde seme the bettre, 
Accordant to his wordes was his cheere, 
As techeth art of speche hem that it leere. 
Al be it that I kan nat sowne his stile, 
Ne kan not clymben over so heigh a style, 
Yet seye I this, as to commune entente, 
Thus much amounteth al that ever he mente, 
If it so be that I have it in mynde . . ." 



LEIGH HUNT. 

" The stranger, who appear'd a noble page, 
High-bred, and of some twenty years of age, 
Dismounted from his horse; and kneeling down, 
Bow'd low before the face that wore the crown; 
Then rose, and reverenc'd lady, lords and all, 
In order as they sat within the hall, 
With such observance, both in speech and air, 
That certainly, had Kubla's self been there, 
Or sage Confucius, with his courtesy, 
Return'd to earth to show what men should be, 
He could not have improv'd a single thing: 
Then turning lastly to address the king, 
Once more, but lightlier than at first, he bow'd, 
And in a manly voice thus spoke aloud . . ." 



TATLOCK-MACKAYE. 

"This strange knight, who came so suddenly, all 
armed full richly save his head, saluted king and queen, 
and all the lords by order as they sat in the hall, with 
such deep reverence and obeisance as well in speech as 
in bearing, that though Gawain with his antique cour- 
tesy were come again out of fairyland, he could not have 
corrected this knight in a word. And then before the 



high table he spake his message in a manly voice, after 
the form used in his language, without fault in syllable 
or letter; and, that so his story should seem the more 
acceptable, his cheer accorded with his words, as the art 
of speech teaches them that learn it. Albeit I cannot 
follow his style, nor climb over so high a stile, yet to 
the general understanding I say this, which was the 
purport of all that ever he said, if so be I have it in 
memory. ..." 

It will be observed that Hunt cut down the num- 
ber of lines by one-third without any correspond- 
ing gain in force or elegance. His substitution 
of Kubla Khan and Confucius is inexplicable, 
and would seem to be an unwarrantable liberty ; 
even if we assume that these men were patterns 
of courtesy (and we know of no such tradition), 
the fact remains that Chaucer does not mention 
them and does mention the familiar Gawain. 
Moreover, Hunt has introduced ideas not in the 
original : the age of the Knight, his dismounting 
from his horse, his bowing after he kneels, his 
second bow to the King. Certainly it is of less 
importance to adhere to the original form than 
it is to render accurately the thought. Hence 
the superiority of prose, in which the translator 
can devote himself unreservedly to the thought. 

This has evidently been the view of the present 
translators. They hold that so many words and 
idioms have undergone subtle changes in mean- 
ing since Chaucer's time that the general reader 
needs more than a bare text and glossary. They 
believe that it is all-important to get at Chaucer's 
thought. In accordance with this belief they 
have tried to be as faithful to the original as 
possible while avoiding four things : rhyme and 
excessive rhythm (which we take to mean the 
rhythm of verse), obscurity, extreme verbosity, 
and excessive coarseness. The general verdict 
of the critic must be that they have succeeded 
admirably. 

While the present translation is worthy of 
high praise, some of the notes are disappoint- 
ingly meagre. It means little to say that the 
" Physiologus " was an early book "on the na- 
tures of animals."' An essential trait was that 
they connected the characteristics and habits 
of animals with the beliefs and observances of 
Christianity. Under "Venus' hour' 1 it would 
have been easy to add the particular hour (the 
second before sunrise on Monday) presided over 
by the goddess. The astrological terms should 
also have been explained more fully. Under 
" Roncesvalles," Tyrwhit's plausible conjecture 
might well have been added. 

For the class of readers who require illustra- 
tions, Mr. Warwick Goble has embellished the 
volume with over thirty full-page illustrations in

color. In themselves, considered without refer- 
ence to the text, they are excellent and include 
much that is beautiful; they do not, however, 
represent anything like our idea of Chaucerian 
scenes, and we doubt if very many readers will 
be found to whom their appeal is strong. For 
some, these pictures will be a hindrance rather 
than a help to the imagination. The picture of 
Emily, for example, has a beautiful setting ; but 
the features of the girl as here drawn are hardly 
such as to cause all the trouble set forth in " The 
Knight's Tale." The reproduction of Blake's 
picture in outline on the end-leaves is effective. 
The make-up of the volume leaves nothing 
to be desired. The paper is excellent, the page 
of good proportions, and the type clear. The 
binding, which is in keeping with other features 
of this handsome volume, helps to make it one 
of the most desirable gift-books of the season.

AN ALBUM FROM GREEK AND ROMAN 
PAYS.* 

Apart from mankind's innate interest in any 
face as an expression of human nature, we may 
say that portraits from ancient Greece and 
Rome appeal primarily to the student of history 
and the lover of plastic art. For the former, 
they frequently preserve the actual lineaments 
of a man or woman depicted with almost photo- 
graphic accuracy, or transmit a character study 
carved in the spirit of a modern portrait painter. 
For the latter, they often provide beautiful ob- 
jects of aesthetic charm, and more often repre- 
sent instructive links in the development of 
style and treatment. The famous portraits of 
Pericles, for instance, reveal to us something of 
the statesman, the general, and the cultured 
humanist ; but they also offer a goodly pleasure 
to the eye, and at the same time tell us that the 
sculptor loved the beautiful as deeply as the 
characteristic, and show us how far he was 
master of his chisel and marble. 

As to the essential merit of a portrait, we 
are all ostentatiously agreed that it is " truth to 
life." But beneath these shortest and simplest 
of words are rooted quarrels that seem to be as 
old as the pyramids. The observing visitor at 
the perfectly arranged Egyptian Museum in 
Cairo will find realism and conventionalism 
facing each other at least as early as the Old 
Kingdom, say three thousand years before 
Christ ; and that, too, in representations of the

same man in the same tomb. Of course, the 
purpose of the statue has to be considered in 
these cases ; but the elements of the debate are 
there, and we have no doubt that the contro- 
versy dates back to the first moment in the his- 
tory of man that saw two sculptors capable of 
choosing and of executing their choice. 

In Greek portraiture, our best authorities 
have felt that the tendency toward an idealiz- 
ing representation was the stronger. In addi- 
tion to the monuments, they adduce to the 
much-quoted authority of Aristotle, who says 
that good portrait painters, while reproducing 
" the distinctive form of the original, make a 
picture which is like the subject and yet more 
beautiful." But we may point out that it is 
easy to carry this belief too far, and that not a 
few artists must have followed the practice of 
giving feature for feature and line for line 
with relentless realism. Demetrius, the much- 
discussed exponent of this style at the close of 
the fifth century, did not shrink from represent- 
ing a distinguished Corinthian general in most 
uncompromising detail, " with a protuberant 
paunch, a ragged wind-tossed beard, and a bald 
head "; and he can hardly have stood alone 
even in that age. In later Greece, certainly, 
there was no lack of realism. Pliny tells us, 
for instance, that Lysistratus "looked upon 
likeness in every detail as the chief aim of por- 
traiture, and that he went so far as to use plas- 
ter casts to transfer actual forms to his work." 

And the question is even more keenly debated 
to-day. Realism, conventionalism, idealism, im- 
pressionism, and illusionism, not to mention 
futurism or a dozen other extravagances, have 
become so rampant that there is some truth in 
Oscar Wilde's paradox that a portrait tells us 
absolutely nothing about the sitter and a great 
deal about the maker. Naturally, we should be 
grateful if Rossetti's prayer could be realized 
and a woman's portrait might show us " beyond 
the light that the sweet glances throw, and re- 
fluent wave of the sweet smile, the very sky and 
sea-line of her soul." But to very few painters 
or sculptors has such skill been vouchsafed, nor 
can many spectators catch even the vision that 
the work of the cunning craftsman legitimately 
embodies. So most of us declare with a sigh 
or a smile that we have two ordinary eyes and 
something within us that feels pleasure or dis- 
pleasure, satisfaction or dissatisfaction ; and the 
average amateur, if he reaches any decision as 
to what makes the difference in a portrait, gen- 
erally does not become more definite than Sir 
Joshua Reynolds, who concludes that the like-

[Dec. 1, 



ness, as well as the grace, of a portrait " con- 
sists more in preserving the general effect of the 
countenance than in the most minute finishing 
of the features, or of any particular parts." 

At this point we may briefly describe the 
offering presented by Dr. Anton Hekler to 
readers or workers who are interested in such 
topics as those suggested above. His volume 
is a generous quarto, containing three hundred 
and eleven plates of illustrative Greek and 
Roman portraits from the fifth century B.C. 
to the fourth century A. D. In connection with 
these the author gives us forty pages of com- 
ment. He has also prepared a serviceable 
bibliography, and an excellent table of illus- 
trations, which gives the home of each portrait 
and often refers to some treatise in which the 
statue is discussed. If we add that his ex- 
amples are well chosen, we shall probably con- 
vey our belief that the album offers convenient 
as well as extensive material for an approach 
to the study of Greek and Roman portraits. 

From such a wealth of material we must 
make an arbitrary choice, and if we first point 
out that Dr. Hekler deals with his general 
theme historically, we may content ourselves 
with instancing his treatment of Socrates. As 
it happens, this offers an enlightening glimpse 
at our author's method, while the subject is one 
of perennial interest. Who will ever forget the 
description of this homeliest of high thinkers 
given by Alcibiades, gloriously drunk, in the 
Symposium of Plato ? "I say he is exactly like 
the figures of Silenus, which may be seen sit- 
ting in the statuaries' shops, having pipes and 
flutes in their mouths ; and they are made to 
open in the middle, and there are images of gods 
inside them." Here then was a dainty task 
for the worker in marble: to show the satyr 
mask and the god within. Such at least was 
the task, if, as Socrates himself had demanded, 
the sculptor was to express the activity of the 
soul in his forms. As a basis for his comment 
Dr. Hekler gives us the Naples bust, the small 
bronze at Munich, the head in the National 
Museum at Rome, and two views of the term 
in the Villa Albani. After pointing out how 
natural it was that the interesting artistic and 
physiognomical problem of the head of Socrates 
should have occupied Greek sculpture for sev- 
eral centuries, he proceeds : 

"No less than three types have come down to us, which 
also represent three different stages of art-development. 
The first type, best represented by the Naples bust (PL 
19) and the small bronze at Munich (111. 2) is a sober, 
naturalistic portrait of the fifth century which renders 
admirably the most striking elements of the outward 



man and is content to forego the deeper, more intense 
vitality of the spirit. The face here has a certain coarse, 
boorish cast. The treatment of the beard recalls that 
of the head of Homer in the Vatican. In the course of 
the fourth century the prosaic naturalism of this head 
was transmuted by the hand of a great artist into lofty 
significance. In this second portrait-type (PI. 20) the 
ugly forms acquire an unsuspected wealth of expressive 
power; the spectator feels himself to be in the presence 
of a highly gifted, gentle, and benevolent being, whose 
intelligent eyes and large mouth with its parted lips sug- 
gest an agreeable loquacity. We would fain ascribe this 
masterly creation to the genius of Lysippos; literature 
credits him with the execution of a statue of Sokrates; 
and our example is stylistically akin to his works. The 
treatment of the beard and hair is a strong point in 
support of the hypothesis. Later, the Silenus-head of 
Sokrates underwent a final free transformation bearing 
all the accents of the Hellenistic period. It is repre- 
sented by a head in the Villa Albani (PL 21). Here the 
artist, careless of likeness, was concerned above all to ren- 
der his conception of the daemonic energy and enthusi- 
astic fervour of the martyred philosopher, with all the 
realistic resources of a fully matured art. This tendency 
removes the Albani head from the domain of reality into 
that of ideal portraiture." 

Herewith we are plunged into the centre of a 
central problem. Granted a trained observer, 
skilled in physiognomy and versed in the condi- 
tions of plastic representation, how much can he 
confidently and reliably tell us about the inten- 
tions of the sculptor and the characteristics of 
the subject revealed by the statue. Now any 
man who has worked under a master like Peter- 
sen will admit that the possibilities are large; 
but there have been many startling contradic- 
tions and still more startling reversals of opinion 
among the experts, and, when all concessions are 
made, the margin of error is so appallingly wide 
that the most modest of reviewers may be par- 
doned for differing rather frequently from the 
conclusions of an author. Dr. Hekler has been 
laudably conservative in assigning names to 
doubtful portraits ; but in dealing with the char- 
acteristics conveyed by a portrait, and with the 
intentions of the sculptor, he often exhibits a 
comprehensiveness and finality that can hardly 
be justified in the present status of our knowl- 
edge. However, he was barred from any ade- 
quate balancing of probabilities for his readers 
by his goodly array of reproductions, if his work 
was to be compassed in one volume; and he 
would probably be the first to admit the possi- 
bility of legitimate differences of opinion. 

In passing to the Roman section of our trea- 
tise we find ourselves debating an old question . 
More than a quarter of a century ago, in a bril- 
liant and most readable contribution, " Vernon 
Lee " declared that Roman portraiture had in- 
troduced something new and wonderful into 
sculpture. In this contention she has been en-

THE DIAL 



thusiastically supported by Mrs. Strong ; but 
despite the hopeful studies of such workers as 
the latter and Professor Wickhoff, who repre- 
sent the extreme in the advocacy of Roman inno- 
vation, there is still more than a little cloud of 
doubt about the " new and wonderful " element 
as manifested in portraiture. Detailed modifi- 
cations of treatment there assuredly were ; but 
further than that it is difficult to go without a 
faltering hesitancy. Dr. Hekler, too, feels that 
there is an essential difference between the two 
groups represented by Hellenistic and Roman 
portrait sculpture, and gropes for the specifi- 
cally Roman element in this later art. However, 
he insists that "there is no breach of continuity, 
but a perfectly organic development "; and, if 
we understand him aright, he explains the differ- 
ence rather by the Roman national physiognomy 
and character than by essential modification of 
the means employed in achieving artistic effects. 
At any rate, Roman portraits are just as inter- 
esting as Miss Paget declared them to be in 
" Euphorion ": "Of this Roman portrait art, of 
certain heads of half -idiotic little Caesar brats, of 
sly and wrinkled old men, things which ought 
to be so ugly and yet are so beautiful, we say, 
at least, perhaps uuformulated, we think, ' How 
Renaissance.' ' 

And it is desperately hard to refrain from 
considering some of the portraits in this section 
of Dr. Hekler's volume. The history of the 
Roman Empire seems to stand before one in a 
sort of personification. Thirteen portraits of 
Augustus, from boyhood to old age, suggest the 
days of transition from Republic to Principate. 
The Claudian degenerates recall the wild trag- 
edy of the Caesars, even if we cannot quite agree 
that " they reveal more of the dark atmosphere 
of those days of cruelty and terror than the 
most circumstantial accounts of historians." 
And so we might trace the story through the 
days of national decline to the ruler who cham- 
pioned the religion of the despised Nazarene. 
But fully as interesting to the student of human 
nature, and more interesting to the lover of art, 
are the private persons, named or nameless. 
From the Pompeiian banker, with his keen 
American face, to the two boys, who are so alike 
and yet so unlike, the reader, or, as one might 
better say, the spectator, may observe a range 
of masculine faces that constantly challenge his 
human interest or critical acumen. Nor will he 
find less attraction in the representatives of the 
other sex, from Julia, with her architectonic coif- 
fure, to the lady with softly waving hair who 
suggests a well-known English writer. And he 



who loves a contrast is invited to turn from the 
austerity of Livia as an elderly woman to the 
girlish grace of the so-called Minatia Polla, be- 
loved of every visitor to the Museo delle Terme. 

But the lure of this collection and of memories 
from the days when we first lingered in Roman 
galleries is tempting our pen far beyond all 
permissible bounds, so we must simply add, what 
is already obvious, that to us the volume seems 
both valuable and enjoyable. 

It is difficult to turn from such thoughts to 
unfavorable criticism of details ; but a few points 
require notice. For instance, might we not have 
had just a word on Egyptian portrait sculpture? 
Some examples are truly remarkable, and despite 
the independence of Greek artistic development, 
it is inconceivable that it was not touched by some 
tiny breath of influence from the valley of the 
Nile. Again, is it absolutely sure that artistic 
activity always begins with abstractions, and that 
the first essays in the portrayal of human beings 
are consequently rather abstractions than imita- 
tions? On the contrary, is there not considerable 
evidence, as well as the evolutionary probability, 
that individual men and particular animals were 
among the earliest subjects of nascent depic- 
tion? In lamenting our loss from the perish- 
ing of painted figures and faces, Dr. Hekler 
mentions as our only relics of importance the 
mummy portraits of Egypt; but the stelae dis- 
covered a few years ago at Pegasae are certainly 
not without value. And, finally, when the work 
was being made ready for English-speaking read- 
ers, why were the most common Greek names 
not given in their ordinary form ? One really 
feels ill at ease in the presence of Aristotcles 
and Epikuros when one has known them so long 
and so familiarly as Aristotle and Epicurus. 
However, these minor points and a few more like 
them, even if they worry a reviewer, are negli- 
gible in comparison with the general services of 
the volume. 

The type is clear, the reproductions satisfac- 
tory, the binding very simple, and the price as 
low as the nature of such a publication would 
reasonably admit. FRED R R> HELLEMS.

[Dec. 1, 



A DISCIPLE OF PATER.* 



It is ten years since Lionel Johnson died, 
and according to the happy phrase chosen as 
the title of his volume of critical studies, he 
now returns to cross again his own threshold 
and to receive for a little the greetings of his 
friends. The clamor of those years has drowned 
voices far louder than his, but his friends have 
not forgotten him. As a poet, he is in the 
strictest sense a minor poet, a seeker of effects 
exquisitely refined ; and in his prose, too, it is 
upon the delicacies of emotion and thought that 
he loves to dwell, and upon the felicities of 
phrase that will alone express them. These are, 
of course, qualities that do not compel a hearing 
from the crowd ; and even for those whom Pater 
calls " disinterested lovers of books," they seem 
nowadays to have lost their appeal. One won- 
ders sometimes if it is not the neglect of the 
Greek and Latin classics, the loss from our 
training of that attention to detail which an 
appreciation of the classical literatures perpetu- 
ally demands, that is responsible for the prev- 
alent taste, even among persons who read, for 
the broad, the slapdash, and the bizarre. Well, 
such persons will not care for Lionel Johnson,' 
nor for his master, Walter Pater, for the style 
of both calls for a somewhat more discriminat- 
ing literary palate than it is the fashion nowa- 
days to cultivate. Nevertheless, there will no 
doubt always be some persons, not very numer- 
ous nor much given to voicing their opinions in 
the market place, who take a quiet satisfaction 
m such writing as this, and who feel a kind of 
friendship for the author of it. " In an age of 
extraordinary vehemence," writes Johnson of 
Erasmus, "his delicacy, his subtlety were bound 
to be ineffective." The writer of these words 
would probably not be surprised to find himself 
little read; yet inasmuch as the Erasmian 
method and the Erasmian temper, in spite of 
their manifest defects, have had in every age 
their warm admirers, so he may count for many 
years to come upon a small and perhaps an in- 
creasing circle of appreciative friends. 

Appreciative and admiring, but not uncriti- 
cal. They will find in this volume, for instance, 
more than a touch of sheer preciosity, a naive 
parade of learning and allusiveness, and, once 
at least, a defect of taste, curiously unexpected 
m these careful pages. "The later sweeter es- 
sayist, Charles Lamb," he writes in the paper 
on Bacon, " was_called by Thackeray * Saint

Charles ; no one could call the cold, corrupt 
Lord Chancellor ' Saint Francis.' " No one, in- 
deed, we agree with a shudder ; but why go so 
obviously out of one's way to produce so poor a 
pleasantry ? These are plainly faults of imma- 
turity not, to be sure, of immaturity of years 
for he was thirty-five when he died, but of that 
sort of immaturity which is the differentia of 
the minor gift, whether in poetry or prose. We 
have called Pater his master, but in his evident 
consciousness of his verbal successes he does not 
remind us of the elder and the greater man . For 
Pater illustrates his own dictum that " beauty 
is only fineness of truth." One feels that he is 
absorbed in the adequate expression of his diffi- 
cult and involved thought, while his pupil not 
seldom appears to be turning his fine phrases 
for their own sake. This is only to say that 
his writing is not of the first, or even of the 
second order ; but at its best, its charm is that 
of the dawn of an exceedingly sensitive and 
subtle talent for criticism and of a rare gift of 
expression. 

He has another mark of the minor prosaist, 
a chameleon-like quality that causes his style to 
vary, within certain limits, its cadence and color 
with the work upon which he is engaged. If he 
is writing of Pater, he writes like Pater; if on a 
subject that would have appealed to Lamb, like 
Lamb. Or, perhaps it would be more correct to 
say that when he writes of men whose nature is 
akin to his, he abandons himself to his genius 
and instinctively praises them in their own vein. 
To Arnold and Newman he is not akin, and 
though he writes of them, he does not write in 
the least like them; but the paper on Stevenson 
is not^unlike Stevenson, "The Work of Mr. 
Pater " is such a piece of criticism as Pater him- 
self in his youth might have signed, and while 
there is no essay on Lamb, there is an essay on 
a subject that Lamb might have chosen, treated 
m the manner in which Lamb would have treated 
it. In the paper on Octavius Pulleyn, an obscure 
seventeenth century poet, a poet, indeed, of 
but one extant poem, we hear what seems the 
very voice of Elia : 

"Nominis umbra, he is a ghost, of whom I know 
nothing; whilst his little bird, the least of birds, lives 
merry and musical yet. Octavius and his like, phantom 
gentlemen m the haunted thicket ' of old years, have a 
singular fine charm. Until some plaguey investigator 
of libraries, of Rolls and Record Offices, unearth my 
twilight friend, he is mine to dream over, mine to play 
with. I can enter him a student at the Inns of Court- 
make him a tavern wit or playhouse censor; I can turn 
him into a country squire, and give him a comely manor 
in the taste of Inigo. We stroll there together through 
the < Itahanate garden,' with its statua and busto, and

pass out into a green coppice. It shall be the old May 
morning of merry England, May of clear sunlight and 
soft wind; Octavius shall quote me his Horace, and I 
cap him with my dearer Virgil. An air of the scholar's 
affectation sits prettily upon us, an Oxford touch. We 
would fain esteem ourselves Younger Plinies of the 
time, and a neat copy of verses is our pride. Octavius 
has a decent fair knack at imitation of the great Mr. 
Cowley, and ever a gratulatory ode at a friend's service. 
So go we gently through the May morning of a dream ; 
of winter nights, we ' drink tobacco ' by the fire of logs 
in a parlour of black panel, and pore together upon the 
medals of popes and emperors. Of such sort is my 
Octavius; and if I weary of him in such sort, he shall 
proceed ambassador to the Hague, and send me word 
of tulips." 

In the short paper, too, entitled "An Old 
Debate," the debate, to wit, over the compara- 
tive charms of town and country, he is, like 
Lamb, all on the side of the town, and praises 
London with a warmth caught from " A 
Londoner ": 

" After all, other people are very companionable. 
Caesar held in mistrust the lean, who think too much; 
others have misliked the haters of children, of music, 
and of bread; for ourselves, we will be friends with no 
man who goes down the Strand with an Odi profanum 
on his lips." 

His fondness for Lamb is one of many tastes 
that he shares with Pater, for nowhere has Pater 
written with a more penetrating sympathy and 
a more quiet perfection of style than in the 
essay on Lamb. 

Indeed, as we have already intimated, this 
volume is full of echoes and suggestions of 
Pater. The four papers that open it treat of 
Pater's humor, his views of Plato, and his work 
as a whole, in the tone of a confessed admirer 
and disciple. Not, however, of an undiscrim- 
inating admirer. More than once he takes pains 
to admit that two opinions may be held of Pater's 
place in criticism. It is as if he felt the neces- 
sity of guarding himself against the charge of 
a too uncritical discipleship. There are pages 
of Pater in which " we seem to take less than 
our customary pleasure." It is possible to differ 
with him in his views of Plato, of Botticelli, of 
the Renaissance. " A discreet judgment " dare 
not class him with the greatest. Yet these, we 
feel, are concessions forced from him by the 
knowledge that without them his praise would 
seem too unmeasured. There is a sentence at 
the close of " The Work of Mr. Pater " which 
tells the story : " There is yet deeper sorrow, 
upon which I cannot touch, save to say that to 
younger men concerned with any of the arts, he 
was the most generous and gracious of helpful 
friends . ' ' Certainly Pater has never been praised 
so justly, so finely, so entirely in his own man- 



ner, as in these pages. It will be remembered, 
too, that one of Lionel Johnson's most exquisite 
poems and one of the most successful brief thren- 
odies in our language was dedicated by him to 
the memory of his master. 

His debt to Pater is felt not only in such 
formal tributes as these, but upon almost every 
page of the volume. The names dear to Pater 
recur again and again, Lamb, Montaigne, Sir 
Thomas Browne, Pascal, St. Francis of Assisi. 
Every now and then one comes upon echoes of 
Pater's own language, as in the affectionate 
repetition of the delightful word " umbratile," 
familiar to lovers of "Marius." The style in 
general is thoroughly Paterian. There is the 
same delicate precision of phrase, the same 
repudiation of the superficial, the obvious, the 
approximate, the same unremitting effort to 
pluck out the heart of some subtle personality 
and enshrine it in an epithet. And the re- 
semblance goes deeper than style. The mind 
of the disciple was evidently profoundly akin 
to the mind of the master. We may say of him 
what he says of Pater : "Things hieratic, ascetic 
appealed always to him." For this reason, the 
papers on Pascal, Thomas a Kempis, Patmore, 
Henry Vaughan, " The Soul of Sacred Poetry," 
are among the best in the volume. For this 
reason, too, we meet everywhere allusions to 
Newman. His characteristic phrases are quoted, 
and his authority is invoked as if a mere refer- 
ence to him were sufficient to settle any moral 
or spiritual question. " To the present writer," 
we read, "the thirty-six volumes of Newman, 
from the most splendid and familiar passages 
down to their slightest and most occasional note, 
are better known than anything else in any lit- 
erature and language." 

There is one notable particular, however, in 
which he forsakes the example of his master. 
One of Pater's most characteristic and admirable 
critical habits was his refusal to speak severely 
of anyone. In the whole range of his writings, 
there is not a line of harsh criticism. He writes 
only of those whom he can praise, justly believ- 
ing that for a subtle and penetrating genius like 
his, there is an ample field for action in the true, 
the beautiful, and the good. But inferior talents 
may be more inclusive, and it is refreshing to find 
that Johnson can wield on proper occasions 
and to our taste his occasions are all proper a 
trenchant pen. Even his strictures on Byron 
seem to us not too severe, and his plain speaking 
on the Bashkirtseff we find peculiarly timely in 
the light of a new, and we think quite unneces- 
sary, volume of her letters and journals. " A dis 



444

eased and silly soul," he calls her, and the letters 
"are the letters of an hysterical lady's-maid." 

We do not forget that Lionel Johnson, as a 
poet, is a prominent figure in the Gaelic revival, 
and it would not be proper to pass over without 
mention the papers in this volume that deal with 
the movement. They are not, however, among 
the most valuable of these studies, and, indeed, 
Johnson's interests and inspirations were too 
wide and his powers, both as critic and as poet, 
too great to permit him to be confined within 
the limits of any movement, however admirable. 
In fact, the paper entitled " Poetry and Patriot- 
ism in Ireland " seems to be, in part, his own 
apology, written in reply to those who thought 
the harp of Tara the only suitable instrument 
for a poet who was really devoted to the Irish 
cause. He makes the plea that Ireland is truly 
honored by all her distinguished sons, even 
though their muse be not strictly " patriotic." 
" There seems to be no place for a poet," he 
writes, " who, though he be intensely national 
in temperament and sympathy, may be unfitted 
by nature to write poetry with an obvious and 
immediate bearing upon the national cause "; 
and he urges that Irish literature be encouraged 
and developed " in a finely national, not in a 
pettily provincial, spirit." 

We end as we began. These essays are for 
the few, not for the many. The author of them, 
like his own Octavius Pulleyne, did not seek 
" to fill the irritated air with agitated echoes "; 
but like that " umbratile, quiet man," he would 
be heartily content with " a miniature immor- 
tality," a fame far short of the highest, and a 
circle of friends intimate, affectionate, and 
secure. CHARLES H. A. WAGER. 



ASPECTS OF SOUTH AMERICA.* 

Travel is still for us the perfect epitome of

visited, the result is, for the reader, a complete

what Mr. Bryce invariably achieves, no matter 
what his theme or what the path of approach. 
He enters the remote periods of the Holy Roman 
Empire with the same fresh enthusiasm as that 
with which he examines our own contemporary 
institutions; he throws himself wholeheartedly 
into sympathy with the difficult past as well as 
with the changing present ; he prophesies to dry 
bones and makes them live again. Perhaps no 
other critic, certainly no other foreigner, 

" hath walked along our roads with step 
So active, so inquiring eye, or tongue 
So varied in discourse." 

If this is true of North America, which he knows 
so well, how infinitely more so of the Southern 
republics, to which he has made but one visit. 
But what a fruitful visit it was ! Such an inquir- 
ing eye is his that it has searched out in a few 
months everything worth seeing, penetrated the 
inmost recesses of thought, and glimpsed things 
which we never dreamed were there. 

It is usual for writers on South America 
not always of judicial temperament to range 
themselves definitely on the side either of the 
optimists or of the pessimists. Mr. Bryce does 
neither, for he- writes with a detachment born 
of the trained mind accustomed to tracing na- 
tional evolutions from their historical past to 
their immediate present. Indeed, the first sign 
that a new land is approaching maturity is when 
that land begins to have leisure, or when others 
think it profitable to cast a look backwards and 
realize the lesson of its past. What a past it has 
been for South America, what a varied tale 
is unfolded ! Not the least interesting part of 
Mr. Bryce's volume deals with historical evolu- 
tion, and his treatment is as judicial and impar- 
tial as it is logical and discriminating. If we 
may venture a criticism so early in our notice, 
however, it would deal with his bias against the 
Spanish colonial system a bias which might 
almost be termed injustice ; for there is no doubt 
in the mind of the present reviewer that, how- 
ever unfortunately it worked out, the system 
itself was fundamentally sound, and that if it 
had only allowed for more or even any self- 
government the whole course of future events 
might have been altered. The only other point 
of possible objection deals also with presumable 
injustice. Mr. Bryce says : 

" Those who quote the age of Queen Victoria and 
the age of Lewis [szc] the Fourteenth as instances to 
support the doctrine that eras of successful war and 
growing power herald, or coincide with, an epoch 
of literary creation, may expect to find that the inces- 
sant strife which has kept hot the blood of the citizens 
of some republics, and the rapid material progress 



1912.]

of others, promise an era of intellectual production in 
South America. Of this, however, there has been no 
sign. National spirit seems little disposed to flow in this 
channel. In the southern republics there is plenty of 
energy, but not much of it is directed towards art or 
science or letters." 

Such a judgment may be true enough in com- 
parison with nearly any European country, but 
to those who have been impressed with the art of 
the Peruvian painter Bacaflor, or of the Chilean 
artist Sotomayor ; to those who are familiar with 
the verse and fiction, in which perhaps Colombia 
and Brazil excel (and there are many who first 
came to realize the importance of Latin America 
as a literary power through the polished work of 
the late Brazilian ambassador, Senhor Nabuco); 
to those who recognize the value of the treatises 
on international law by the internationally known 
Argentine authority on the subject, Dr. Drago 
to all such Mr. Bryce's statement would seem 
to demand modification. 

But as a rule the author's criticisms and 
they are few considering his opportunities to 
make them are constructive, free alike from 
scorn and condescension. Perhaps the most 
important contribution of the present volume is 
its help toward a better understanding, largely 
fostered by the author's generous and sympa- 
thetic point of view. This is the spirit, for in- 
stance (though his favorite country seems to be 
Chile) in which he describes Brazil. "Not 
even the great North American republic has a 
territory at once so vast and so productive," 
a territory which, if in the hands of the Anglo- 
Saxon race, would in thirty years have fifty 
millions of inhabitants. But to Mr. Bryce 
"second or third thoughts suggest a doubt 
whether such a consummation is really in the 
interest of the world. May not territories be 
developed too quickly ? Might it not have been 
better for the United States if their growth had 
been slower, if their public lands had not been 
so hastily disposed of, if in their eagerness to ob- 
tain the labour they needed they had not drawn 
in a multitude of ignorant immigrants from Cen- 
tral and Southern Europe ? ' ' British ownership, 
however, does not necessarily mean prosperity or 
development even when the natural resources 
are not lacking. Bordering Brazil there is the 
colony of British Guiana, with territory as large 
as Great Britain, the possessor of boundless re- 
sources. " For nearly a century it has formed 
part of the British empire, yet its population is 
less than four souls to the square mile." But 
surely Mr. Bryce's observation as to our own 
development is just, and it cannot do us harm 
fully to realize the logic of it. 



Such considerations as these, around which 
an infinite text and argument might be woven, 
form the basis for the latter half of the volume. 
Eleven of the sixteen chapters contain a simple 
narration , interspersed with glowing appreciation 
of the grandeurs of nature, of what Mr. Bryce 
saw both of the country and its inhabitants. In 
the remaining chapters, as might have been ex- 
pected, the distinguished author draws liberally 
on his knowledge of history to give more point 
to his views. Not even Mr. Bryce deems him- 
self qualified to give us general reflections on 
the future of these republics as a body, for they 
are too diversified to be treated collectively^ 
But he does venture individual conclusions which 
are worthy of the most attentive consideration,, 
and he so far avoids undue optimism as to con- 
tent himself with saying : " The troubles of these 
ninety years have, accordingly, nothing in them* 
that need dishearten either any friend of Span- 
ish America or any friend of constitutional 
freedom." 

If we stopped here we should give a very im- 
perfect impression of Mr. Bryce's volume; but no 
review can do full justice to a work which must 
immediately be regarded as the last word on the 
subject, to us of the North a necessary com- 
plement to " The American Commonwealth." 
One or two errors should be corrected in the 
next edition. Perhaps the most flagrant of 
these proclaims that "the area of Brazil is about 
3,300,000 square miles larger than that of the 
United States"! Dom Pedro is throughout 
called " Don." An excellent index and some 
good maps complete a handsome volume. 

All books of foreign travel are divided into 
two classes those which are meant to be read 
and enjoyed at home, and those which are to- 
be packed in a bag and consulted, something 
after the manner of a guidebook, on the spot* 
If Mr. Bryce's volume is one of the few which- 
belong to both classes, two other recent works 
of South American travel, not less interesting 
in their way but in a vastly more confined ex- 
tent, must be placed in the second . Mr. Caspar 
Whitney's " The Flowing Road " derives its- 
title from the nature of his travel, he tells of 
five separate overland and river expeditions into 
the heart of South America, all of which were 
largely undertaken by canoe and on streams 
more or less connected. Mr. Whitney's success- 
ful attempt to reach the unknown land at the 
head of the Orinoco River, through the un- 
friendly Indians and almost impassable natural 
barriers, when all save one native companion 
had fled, presents the other side of South Amer- 



446

ican travel in a most engaging and romantic 
way. Mr. Bryce did not reach this part of the 
continent, and if he had he would no doubt have 
been lavishly entertained by the Colombian and 
Venezuelan governments. All the official pro- 
vision that Mr. Whitney sought was help in 
procuring trustworthy guides, help not partic- 
ularly efficacious. 

It is curious that more or less the same region 
traversed by Mr. Whitney, that of the lower 
Orinoco, is described in the volume by Mr. 
Lindon Bates, Jr., entitled " The Path of the 
Conquistadores. ' ' The trail of these picturesque 
old conquerors Mr. Bates followed in an expedi- 
tion which started from Trinidad, proceeded up 
the Orinoco to Angostura, and thence on mule- 
back into the interior of Venezuela near the sur- 
mised location of the legendary Golden City of 
Manoa, in the search for which so many adven- 
turers have given their lives. This volume is 
slighter in substance than in form, due to very 
large print and to the many and usually excel- 
lent illustrations. The text, however, forms an 
interesting mixture of fact and gossip about what 
is no doubt the least known and esteemed portion 
of the continent. 

One of the more conventional books of South 
American travel is Mr. H. W. Van Dyke's 
" Through South America." It is introduced 
with a preface, by Mr. John Barrett, which 
rather " writes down" to the reader in such a 
way as to imply that both book and preface are 
intended as an elementary course for those who 
know little of South American history, institu- 
tions, or nature. If such be the case, the volume 
has fulfilled its intention; nowadays, how- 
ever, with the ever-increasing flood of Latin- 
Americana, there seems little need for a further 
essay in a field which for the last ten years has 
been covered to satiety. But the present work, 
having much to commend it besides its admir- 
able form and illustrations, should not be dis- 
missed so superficially. The author has a happy 
way of expressing himself, and conveys his en- 
thusiasms so naively as to make us instinctively 
share them if we do not read too carefully. 
Though he by no means catches the spirit of 
such a book as Mr. Arthur Ruhl's " The Other 
Americans," or imparts the thrill of new dis- 
coveries conveyed in Mr. Bingham's " Across 
South America " (which latter title, by the way, 
is a serious omission in Mr. Van Dyke's bibliog- 
raphy), he does succeed in bringing home to us 
a pleasantly agreeable picture of life and nature 

in South America.

BOOKS OF TRAVEL AND DESCRIPTION. 

A few of New England's many famous and 
historically interesting summer resorts are treated 
with the knowledge and sympathy of long acquaint- 
ance by Mr. F. Lauriston Bullard in his " His- 
toric Summer Haunts from Newport to Portland" 
(Little, Brown & Co.), which Mr. Louis H. Ruyl has 
adorned with thirty-two admirable drawings, printed 
on a tinted background. The haunts are all on 
or near the coast, Newport, Plymouth, Quincy, 
Lexington, Concord, Sudbury (included for its 
Wayside Inn), Marblehead, Gloucester, Salem, 
Haverhill and Amesbury (the "Whittier country"), 
Newburyport, Portsmouth, and Portland. From 
the abundance of history and tradition, literature 
and legend, touching these fine old towns, Mr. 
Bullard has taken with a free hand, yet not with- 
out discrimination, for the enrichment of his book, 
while his own running commentary is packed with 
welcome explanation and suggestion and allusion. 
Writing of Salem, for example, he reminds us that 
" Hawthorne was not an admirer of Salem, but in 
Salem he lived, almost as a recluse, for years." 
And he wrote much about the old seaport, about its 
custom-house, its town pump, its now famous seven- 
gabled house, its "Main Street" (which is now 
Essex Street), and its romantic history. As the 
author points out, "Salem has no less than eight 
Hawthorne houses: the house of his birth, the 
house of his youth, the house of his courtship, the 
house in which James T. Fields persuaded him to 
surrender the manuscript of 'The Scarlet Letter,' 
these and the House of the Seven Gables, the 
custom-house, and two other houses in which the 
writer lived, account for some twenty-five years of 
his life." At Portsmouth the Aldrich house, now 
the Thomas Bailey Aldrich Memorial Museum, will 
be to many the chief object of interest. The book 
is of most inviting appearance, its rich binding 
displaying the Wayside Inn, stamped in gilt on the 
front cover. 

That ancient bit of advice, If you wish to learn 
a subject thoroughly write a book about it, seems 
to have been followed faithfully by Mr. Philip San- 
ford Marden, who, when he was reading up for a 
vSit to Egypt, failed to find just the kind of book 
he required for his enlightenment; and so, on his 
return from the Nile country, he has himself filled 
the gap and written the compactly informing and 
at the same time readable and enjoyable book that 
his own need had shown to be lacking. At any rate, 
this seems to have been the genesis of his " Egyptian 
Days" (Houghton), a volume similar in character 
and scope to his "Travels in Spain," which met 
with a kindly reception three years ago. What the 
intelligent tourist most wishes and needs to know, 
to make his Egyptian travels enjoyable and fruitful, 
is what Mr. Marden has tried to furnish in his six- 



1912.]

teen scholarly chapters, which are evenly divided 
between lower Egypt and the regions further up the 
Nile. The illustrations, forty-three in number, are 
mostly from photographs taken by the author, and 
the map at the end of the book is from his hand. 
A typical Egyptian scene in bright colors adorns 
the front cover. The volume is a fine piece of work 
in all respects a suitable gift to the intending 
winter tourist or sojourner on the Nile. 

One who can find such charm and fresh delight in 
a solitary canal-boat journey through rural England 
as Mr. E. Temple Thurston has found in his month's 
meanderings on board the "Flower of Gloster," and 
who can so well transfer his daily experiences and 
impressions to the printed page, ought not to seek 
in vain for readers. "The 'Flower of Gloster'" 
(Dodd), named from the newly and gaudily painted 
barge which he secured for his rather unusual form 
of outing, is written in much the same light-hearted, 
high-spirited vein as Stevenson's "Inland Voyage." 
"I would not for a kingdom," says Mr. Thurston, 
" have missed those few weeks in the heart of En- 
gland, far distant from any of those main thorough- 
fares where the dust of motors powders the face of 
Nature till she is worse than some painted thing. 
Scarce a soul is to be met along those winding tow- 
paths, for you may be sure that where a canal runs 
from one town to another, that is the longest way it 
is possible to go." From Oxford to Inglesham, by 
these devious windings, the "Flower of Gloster" 
made her leisurely way, towed by faithful Fanny, 
while Fanny in turn was driven by Eynsham Harry 
at thirty shillings a week and "found," though he 
would have gladly accepted considerably less. The 
copious illustrations of the book include six colored 
plates and are all from the deft hand of Mr. W. R. 
Dakin. That so much of interior England and Wales 
is accessible by canal-boat will be a surprise to most 
readers. The remorseless railway, with its short cuts 
and its saving of invaluable time, has put the inland 
waterways very much into the class of "back num- 
bers," so that Mr. Thurston's voyage strikes one as 
decidedly novel and interesting and worthy of imi- 
tation. 

Something distinctly out of the ordinary in Euro- 
pean travel literature is presented by Mr. George 
Wharton Edwards in his "Marken and Its People" 
(Moffat), which is described on the title-page as 
" some account written from time to time both during 
and after visits covering some considerable space of 
time upon this most curious and comparatively un- 
known island unknown in spite of the fact that 
thousands of tourists visit it each year, but of the 
character or life of these strange people they know 
little or nothing." The island in question, which is 
really a number of small sandy hillocks separated by 
shallow canals and strongly dyked against the invad- 
ing Zuyder Zee, would probably remain uninhabited 
in any quarter of the globe where dry land is less 
at a premium than in Holland. It is surmised that 
the terrors of the Spanish Inquisition first caused the 
colonization of the unpromising islet, and the original 



manners and customs of these early settlers have been 
largely preserved to this day. In seventeen chapters 
and twenty pencil sketches and a colored frontispiece 
the author makes his readers somewhat familiarly 
acquainted with Marken ("Marriker" the natives 
call it) and its delightfully unsophisticated inhabit- 
ants. The book is as striking to the eye in its elab- 
orate and Dutch-like exterior ornamentation as it is 
appealing to the interest in its reading matter. 

A volume refreshingly original in recent travel 
literature is presented by Mr. Charles Fish Howell 
in his "Around the Clock in Europe " (Houghton). 
The plan of the work is explained to the eye by the 
cover design, a clock dial with the names of twelve 
European cities running around it ; and this plan is 
further elucidated by the author in his preface. His 
purpose was to convey in words a picture of each of 
these twelve places at what he has considered its 
typical hour. Thus Edinburgh is described as seen 
in the early afternoon, from one to two o'clock ; Ant- 
werp from two to three ; Rome from three to four ; 
Prague from four to five ; Scheveningen from five 
to six ; Berlin from six to seven ; London from seven 
to eight ; Naples from eight to nine ; Heidelberg, 
from nine to ten ; Interlaken from ten to eleven ; 
Venice in the hour before midnight; and gay and 
wicked Paris in the hour after midnight. Mr. Harold 
Field Kellogg has drawn twenty-five views (a vig- 
nette at the beginning of each chapter, and a larger 
plate inserted a little later ) to embody, visually, the 
author's thought. Venice claims the added distinc- 
tion of furnishing a motif for the book's frontispiece, 
a view of the Piazza San Marco from the Grand 
Canal. 

Mr. and Mrs. Walter Hale's "Motor Journeys" 
(McClurg) is made up of thirteen breezy narrative 
chapters that have appeared separately in "Harper's 
Magazine " and other periodicals, with numerous 
illustrations by Mr. Hale and an appended discus- 
sion by him of the cost of this mode of sight-seeing. 
Mrs. Hale (Louise Closser Hale) has written the rest 
of the book. It is in western Europe and northern 
Africa that the scene of the story for it has some 
of the fascination of fiction is laid. As to practi- 
cal matters, Mr. Hale, who has made seven motor 
tours in Great Britain and on the Continent in the 
last eight years, asserts that the daily expense can 
be kept down to ten dollars or even less. France 
is the motorist's paradise ; the roads are the best in 
Europe, and the hotel bills, except in the large cities, 
are moderate. But gasolene costs about twice what 
it does in England, for some unexplained reason. 
Spain stands at or near the other end of the scale 
for desirability to the automobilist. The artist's 
drawings for this series of motor journeys are many 
in number and tasteful in design. They are repro- 
duced in such a manner as to convey the general 
impression of etchings. Intending motor- tourists 
will find the book of especial interest and full of 
useful hints and information. 

Some voyagers, like Captain Amundsen and Com- 
mander Peary, seek the uttermost ends of the earth,

and then record their perilous adventures for admir- 
ing thousands to read ; others, like R. L. Stevenson, 
content themselves with an inland voyage or a coast- 
wise cruise, and let their inventive fancy play about 
the simple incidents of the outing in a way to amuse 
their host of appreciative readers. Mr. E. Keble 
Chatterton is one of the inland voyagers, and his 
"Through Holland in the Vivette" (Lippincott) is 
the variously entertaining logbook of " the cruise of 
of a 4-tonner from the Solent to the Zuyder Zee, 
through the Dutch waterways," with sixty illustra- 
tions, harbor-plans, charts, etc. As shown by " Down 
Channel in the Vivette," Mr. Chatterton knows how 
to get the very most out of a yachting trip such as 
the present volume describes. A few of his chapter- 
headings (such as " A Chapter of Accidents," 
" Southampton Water to Ramsgate," " Ramsgate 
to Calais," "Calais to Ostende," and so on, with 
landings at Dordrecht, Amsterdam, and other im- 
portant points) may serve to indicate the nature of 
the book's contents. The author had as sailing mate 
Mr. Norman S. Carr, who sketched and photo- 
graphed for the book's embellishment. It is a good 
substantial volume, ably planned and pleasingly 
executed. 

Opportunity for the study of primitive savagery 
in darkest Africa is constantly narrowing with the 
invasion and settlement of those regions on the part 
of Europeans, so that in a few years it may be 
impossible for an explorer to produce such a book 
as Mr. M. W. Hilton-Simpson, F.R.G.S., F.Z.S., 
F.R.A.I., has written in " Land and Peoples of the 
Kasai" (McClurg). It is "a narrative of a two 
years' journey among the cannibals of the equatorial 
forest and other savage tribes of the south-western 
Congo," and is illustrated with many process-prints 
from photographs taken in most instances by the 
author, and also with eight colored plates. A large 
folding map of the Belgian Congo follows the read- 
ing matter, and a ten-page index closes the book. 
The work shows the careful personal observation 
that gives value to books of its class. The author 
rejoices at having been able " to amass a great num- 
ber of objects for the British Museum " and "to turn 
to good advantage the opportunities we had enjoyed 
of studying the primitive African negro before he 
has been materially changed by contact with the 
European." 

To disabuse oneself of any lingering preconception 
that Switzerland is a country to be visited only in 
summer, one merely needs to open Mr. Edmund B. 
d'Auvergne's "Switzerland in Sunshine and Snow," 
a book that portrays with pen and camera the charms 
of the Swiss winter as nowise inferior to those of the 
Swiss summer. A chapter devoted to the native cold- 
weather sports finds appropriate place in the book, 
side by side with one on " Winter in the Alps." Other 
sections treat in agreeable detail of the St. Bernard 
dogs, the guides, the Lion of Lucerne, Chillon, Neu- 
chatel, Berne, the Bernese Oberland, "the Protest- 
ant Rome," which is, of course, Geneva, the land of 
William Tell, the Swiss lowlands, and other districts 



and features of this favorite European playground. 
Incidents of travel and other personal experience 
enliven the author's pages and make it abundantly 
evident that he is writing from 110 second-hand or 
guide-book information. He loves his Switzerland, 
and he makes his feeling contagious. Thirty-six 
typical views, four of them colored, help to transplant 
the reader, in imagination, from his arm-chair to the 
lakes and mountains whose like are nowhere else to 
be found. Ornate binding, large print, an index to- 
the proper names in the book, and a good box to hold 
the volume are all duly provided. (Little, Brown & 
Co.). 

The Scottish Border has something in its very 
name that suggests romance, and of this agreeably 
suggestive quality Mr. A. G. Bradley has made the 
most in his rambling sketches of southeastern Scot- 
land which he has gathered into a volume under the 
title, "The Gateway of Scotland, or East Lothian,. 
Lammermoor, and the Merse " (Houghton). Mr. 
A. L. Collins contributes eight cheerful views in the 
opulent hues of nature or even with somewhat 
more than nature's opulence in this matter of color 
and fifty-seven soberer drawings in black and 
white. Mr. Bradley well says that the region chosen 
by him for description and comment is almost an 
unknown land to the great travelling public. His 
very first chapter, on Berwick-on-Tweed, will catch 
the average reader cherishing the mistaken fancy 
that this old town is on Scottish soil; and, indeed, 
as the author remarks, "that the whole south- 
eastern corner of what by every law of nature and 
common sense should be the Scottish county of 
Berwickshire beyond Tweed, even to the measure 
of some eight square miles of pastoral and tillage 
upland, is English soil, remains, I feel morally 
certain, a geographical and political curiosity only 
understood by Borderers." And what, furthermore, 
will ninety-nine non-Scottish readers out of a hun- 
dred conceive to be designated by such geographical 
names as East Lothian, Lammermoor, and the 
Merse ? The book is well worth a nearer acquaint- 
ance, if only for the sake of clearing up these 
obscurities. 

Good line drawings that convey the impression 
of wood-cuts diversify in pleasing manner the pages 
of Mr. Percy Allen's u Burgundy, the Splendid 
Duchy " (Pott), and not even the eight water-colors 
by the same artist (Miss Marjorie Nash) can make 
us forgo our partiality for the less elaborate but more 
satisfying sketches. The reading matter which these 
illustrate and enliven comprises a series of " studies 
and sketches in South Burgundy," interweaving per- 
sonal experience and learned comment in a way to 
win the reader's attention and make him consider- 
ably wiser in the art, history, traditions, and customs 
of the duchy than he was before. Burgundy has 
played no unimportant part in European history. 
The author reminds his readers that "it saw the 
genesis of a religious movement that was the great- 
est feature of eleventh and twelfth century history. 
Cluny was a nursery of popes; Citeaux became a

breeding-ground of saints ; their abbots lorded it 
over mighty kings ; they dictated to potentates and 
princes ; they bent all western Europe beneath their 
sway." Mr. Allen's book is one of the best of its 
class, written not for the passing season, but for 
permanent keeping and repeated reading and con- 
sultation. Its appeal to the eye also makes it an 
attractive gift book. 

HOLIDAY BOOKS OF HISTORY. 

Local history has no more enthusiastic devotee 
than Mr. Stephen Jenkins, careful chronicler of 
Broadway's numberless points of historic interest 
from Bowling Green to Albany, and more recently 
author of a companion volume on "The Story of 
the Bronx" (Putnam), which traces the borough's 
settlement and growth from its purchase by the 
Dutch (from the Indians) in 1639 to the present 
day. As with its predecessor, " The Greatest 
Street in the World," this work is the product of 
years of research and note- taking. The author says 
in his preface: "The preparation of this history 
has taken over a decade, during which time I have 
jotted down various facts and incidents as I have 
run across them, either in books, or in the daily 
press, or in magazines. I have kept no account of 
the sources from which I have drawn my facts, 
so that I can furnish no bibliography." But he 
acknowledges indebtedness to Bolton's and Scharf 's 
histories of Westchester County. "The earlier his- 
tory of the Borough," he tells us, "can be found in 
both these works, if one has plenty of time to search 
for it." Among his most interesting chapters are 
those touching on colonial manners and customs, the 
Bronx during the Revolution, the churches, early 
and later means of communication, and ferries and 
bridges. More than one hundred illustrations and 
maps are interspersed, the former from photographs 
taken by the author, and the latter so chosen as to 
represent the borough's topography at the close of 
each distinct period in its history. The frontis- 
piece of the book is a reproduction of Mr. E. W. 
Deming's painting, " The Purchase of Keskeskeck, 
1639," and there are numerous other illustrations. 
An excellent index of nearly twenty double-column 
pages completes the volume. 

The springing of our American Boston from the 
loins of old Boston in England, whose famous church 
(St. Botolph's) is more than twice as old as the 
younger city which derives its name, indirectly, from 
the patron saint of the Lincolnshire town, is not yet 
so hackneyed a theme of historical narrative as to 
render superfluous Mr. Albert C. Addison's volume 
of original research and entertaining comment and 
discussion, "The Romantic Story of the Puritan 
Fathers, and their Founding of New Boston and the 
Massachusetts Bay Colony, together with Some Ac- 
count of the Conditions which Led to their Departure 
from Old Boston and the Neighboring Towns in En- 
gland" (Page). The length of the title, the greater 
part of which is really a sub-title, but worth noting 
for the sake of completeness, need not dismay any 



intending reader. The book itself is of moderate 
proportions, diversified with frequent illustrations 
from old and new Boston, especially the former. In 
fact, the parent rather than the lusty offspring claims 
the chief attention, which is gladly accorded. In 
the table of contents such promising headings as the 
following arrest the eye, The Mayflower Pilgrims, 
The Puritan Exodus, A Boston Adventure, John 
Cotton, Quaint Services in Boston Church, Mutila- 
tion of the Town's Maces, Church Life in Boston, 
The Lincolnshire Movement, Faith and Flight of 
Cotton, Old Boston in Cotton's Day, The Bostons 
and "The Scarlet Letter," Links with Old Boston, 
and Cotton's Successors at St. Botolph's. The book 
is highly ornamented, with page-borders in olive 
green, tinted illustrations from photographs, a useful 
index, and a neat box to preserve all these good 
things from defacement. 

Miss Mary Caroline Crawford has in former books 
succeeded so well in transporting her readers to the 
early times of Boston that large expectations are 
excited by the appearance of her " Romantic Days 
in the Early Republic " (Little, Brown & Co.). What 
she did so well for her own city in " Old Boston Days 
and Ways " and " Romantic Days in Old Boston" 
she now does for a larger constituency, selecting 
such portions of history and tradition as may restore 
to us with something of charm and fascination the 
by-gone days of Philadelphia, New York, Washing- 
ton, Baltimore, Charleston, Richmond, New Orleans, 
and, in a concluding chapter, Boston once more and 
certain other cities of New England. Naturally, 
good use has been made of such interesting char- 
acters as Hamilton and Burr, Jerome Bonaparte 
and his wife, Lafayette, and Franklin, and Andrew 
Jackson, and many others. The materials for such 
reconstruction of the past are abundant; the merit 
of the book lies in their skilful use. No formal 
bibliography of her manifold theme is drawn up by 
the author, but her pages contain frequent incidental 
references to her authorities. A pleasanter way to 
study American history the history of our manners 
and customs, and something about our great men and 
women of the past could not be imagined than the 
way opened to the reader of Miss Crawford's chatty 
and anecdotal volumes. As in her former works, 
illustrations from old prints and portraits are given 
in profusion. 

A re-issue in two volumes of Mrs. Elizabeth W. 
Champney's three volumes on the French ch&teaux 
(feudal, renaissance, and Bourbon) is among the 
season's notable books of travel and description. 
" Romance of the French Chateaux " (Putnam) will 
in its new form attract fresh readers. Its author's 
skill and artistry in interweaving the history and 
legend of the scenes visited by her are familiar to 
readers of her other "romance" volumes on the 
French abbeys, the Italian villas, and the Roman 
villas. Her artist-husband, one gathers from her 
pages, accompanied her on her travels, and supple- 
ments the photographs that adorn her volumes with 
occasional less mechanical representations of things

seen. Among the famous castles pictured and 
described in the present work are to be noted the 
chateaux of Mont St. Michel, Falaise, Gaillard, 
Josselin, Laval, Cbateaudun, Chaumont, Nantes. 
Amboise, Pau, Les Rochers, and others of equal 
celebrity. Les Rochers serves as excuse, if any were 
needed, for devoting considerable space to Madame 
de Se'vigne' and her circle. An index to the varied 
riches of these agreeable volumes would have in- 
creased their usefulness. The retention of the old 
page-numbering is a little confusing, but not easily 
avoidable. Otherwise the workmanship is all that 
could be desired. 

Prepared especially for members of the City His- 
tory Clubs, the twenty-four monographs comprising 
" Historic New York during Two Centuries " (Put- 
nam) were originally published some years ago in 
two volumes. Their present collection in one-volume 
form at a moderate price ought to enlarge their circu- 
lation. The staff of editors and writers (including 
such names as Maud Wilder Goodwin, Alice Car- 
rington Royce, Ruth Putnam, Eva Palmer Brownell, 
Alice Morse Earle, Oswald Garrison Villard, George 
E. Waring, Jr., George Everett Hill, Elizabeth Bis- 
land, John B. Pine, Talcott Williams, Spencer Trask, 
and others of like prominence) is one to carry weight 
with all readers, and the subjects treated such as 
"Fort Amsterdam in the Days of the Dutch," "The 
Early History of Wall Street," "The City Chest of 
New Amsterdam," "Old Greenwich," "King's Col- 
lege," "The Bowery," "Tammany Hall," "Bowling 
Green," "The Doctor in Old New York, "and "Early 
Schools and Schoolmasters of New Amsterdam" 
form an inviting list. Sixty-two illustrations and 
maps contribute to the attractiveness and value of 
the volume. 

By the use of thin but opaque paper, one not 
unwieldy volume, entitled "Colonial Homesteads 
and their Stories" (Putnam), has been formed from 
the two already favorably known as " Some Colonial 
Homesteads" and "More Colonial Homesteads," 
written some years ago by her whose pen-name 
("Marion Harland") is a guaranty of good literary 
quality and skilled workmanship. The stories of 
colonial life with which the above-named works 
abound will attract new readers to the present one- 
volume re-issue. Exceptional facilities for gathering 
the information they contain were enjoyed by the 
writer, who was received as a guest at the various 
homesteads pictured in her pages, and who had placed 
at her disposal all sorts of family records and faded 
manuscripts and curious mementos of a by-gone time, 
from which to frame her graphic chapters. The 
illustrations comprise both exterior and interior 
views and portraits, and are in lavish abundance. 
The southern and middle Atlantic States are chiefly 
represented in the mansion described, so that there 
remain many old New England houses for the full 
and intimate treatment which they, no less than 
these others, richly deserve. The original division 
into two parts, with full index to each, is preserved 
in the one-volume form of the work. 



HOLIDAY AKT BOOKS. 

A novelty in the literature of arts and crafts is 
presented in "A Book of Hand-woven Coverlets," 
by Eliza Calvert Hall (Mrs. William Alexander 
Obenchain), whose "Aunt Jane of Kentucky" has 
made her name well-known in a rather different 
department of literature. The old-fashioned hand- 
woven coverlet is to her an object of human as well 
as of artistic interest, and she evidently feels that 
if she could understand it, woof and all, and all in 
all, she would know what God and man is. In it 
she sees "poetry, romance, religion, sociology, phil- 
ology, politics, and history." Four years of search 
and travel in many states were spent in gathering 
facts and designs for her book ; it was a new field 
of study, and she had to break her own road through 
the wilderness. Even if, as she intimates, there still 
remains a vast unexplored domain of coverlet-lore, 
her book is still a considerable and a praiseworthy 
achievement. Its ten agreeable chapters afford us 
a glimpse into the primitive times of the spinning- 
wheel and hand-loom ; introduce to us the mountain 
weavers of Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and 
Kentucky, where indeed "women are working at 
wheel and loom just as their great- great-grand- 
mothers worked "; discuss the mysteries of coverlet 
designs and colors and names ; touch on the historic 
and family associations of the "storied coverlet"; 
and, finally, appeal to the reader to rescue and cher- 
ish any heirloom of the coverlet kind that may be 
lying unappreciated in attic or storeroom. Sixteen 
colored plates and forty-eight in half-tone present to 
the eye as many patterns of hand-woven coverlets. 
The photographic process has transferred the mi- 
nutest details of web and design to the page, and 
where colors have been used the beauty of the pat- 
tern is still further reproduced. The text is printed 
in unusually clear type, and the handsome binding 
shows, very appropriately, a pleasing coverlet design 
on the front cover. (Little, Brown & Co.) 

The poetry of motion is lavishly pictured and 
adequately described in three notable volumes on 
the modern art of dancing, chiefly stage dancing. 
First, there is Miss Ethel L. Urlin's "Dancing, 
Ancient and Modern " (Appleton), a compact and 
useful treatise, giving briefly the history of the chief 
varieties and some minor varieties of the dance, 
even including the cake-walk, the Apache dances, 
Maori dances, and the danse macabre. As a handy 
epitome of the whole subject, with pleasing illustra- 
tions from paintings and from life, the book is to be 
commended. Appropriate selections from the poets 
are interspersed, and an embossed representation of 
Miss Maud Allan exemplifying the latest form of 
stage dancing adorns the cover. The second work 
is Mr. J. E. Crawford Flitch's "Modern Dancing 
and Dancers " (Lippincott), a volume of quarto size 
enlivened with colored plates as well as with many 
half-tone illustrations. The author devotes one chap- 
ter to a cursory historical view, " The Ancient and 
Modern Attitude Towards the Dance," and then 
gives his attention to the ballet in different countries,

the skirt dance, the serpentine dance, the high kick- 
ers, the revival of classical dancing, Russian dancers, 
oriental and Spanish dancing, the revival of the 
morris dance, and the future of dancing. Believing 
as he does that "when the art historian of the future 
comes to treat of the artistic activity of the first dec- 
ade of the twentieth century, he will remark as one 
of its most notable accomplishments a renaissance of 
the art of the Dance," he handles his theme with 
befitting seriousness and, what is more, engages the 
serious interest of the reader. Some good reproduc- 
tions from Sargent and other painters are among the 
illustrations of this sumptuous volume. Last but not 
least, we have Mr. and Mrs. Charles H. Caffin's rich 
quarto volume, "Dancing and Dancers of Today" 
(Dodd), or, as the subtitle reads, "The Modern 
Revival of Dancing as an Art." Together with some 
tracing of the history of modern dancing there are 
chapters on individual dancers: Isadora Duncan, 
Maud Allan, Ruth St. Denis, Gende, Mordkin, Pav- 
lowa, Sacchetto, and Wiesenthal; and also chap- 
ters on the ballet, the Russian dance-drama, court 
dances, eccentric dancing, and folk dancing. Forty- 
eight large plates from photographs illustrate the 
work, which is ornately bound and boxed. 

Mr. Frank Roy Fraprie, having already written 
agreeably of Bavarian inns and Scottish castles and 
Munich art galleries, confines his attention for his 
this year's book to a single great artist and his works. 
" The Raphael Book " (Page) is described in its sub- 
title as " an account of the life of Raphael Santi of 
Urbino and his place in the development of art, to- 
gether with a description of his paintings and fres- 
coes." Fifty-four full-page plates, six of them in 
color, reproduce or at least suggest to the reader's 
eye the chief masterpieces of this artist who first 
made religious painting something more than a stiff 
conventionality. New facts are of course not to be 
sought in any re-telling of the story of Raphael's 
life ; but new points of emphasis, new opinions on 
debatable questions in his art, and fresh enthusiasm 
for his genius, are always possible and in order. It 
is in this freshness of presentation and hearty enjoy- 
ment of Raphael's peculiar merits that the strength 
of Mr. Fraprie's book lies. The volume ends with 
a useful list of pictures painted by or attributed to 
Raphael, and a twelve-page index. The many illus- 
trations and handsome binding of the work make it 
a suitable gift book. It is neatly and strongly boxed. 

Of increasing interest because of increasing rarity 
is the old colonial homestead exemplified by the 
Cabot house at Salem, the Fowler house at Danvers, 
the Jewett house at Georgetown, Mass., the Warner 
house at Portsmouth, and a number of others still 
standing in the older towns of our Atlantic States. 
" Colonial Homes and their Furnishings," by Miss 
Mary H. Northend, is a volume rich in descriptive 
details of such early and noteworthy examples of 
domestic architecture as are to be found in old 
Salem, Marblehead, Danvers, Newburyport, and 
other places not far distant, with a considerable 
study of old colonial furniture and decoration all 



elaborately illustrated with more than two hundred 
plates. It was illness and a desire for occupation 
to divert her thoughts that first turned the author's 
attention to the subjects treated in her book, and 
now, she tells us in her preface, she has one of the 
most valuable existing collections of photographs 
illustrating those subjects. Her arrangement of 
topics, as indicated in the table of contents, is note- 
worthy. First she discusses old houses in their total- 
ity, then colonial doorways, door-knockers, old-time 
gardens, halls and stairways, wall-papers, chairs and 
sofas, sideboards and bureaus and tables, f our- posters, 
mirrors, clocks, old-time lights, old china, old glass, 
old pewter, and old silver. The largeness of the 
book's pages admits of some unusually fine illustra- 
tions, as for instance that of the Nichols garden, the 
Middleton house, the Andrew-house doorway, and 
others that might be named. Clear type, a full in- 
dex, and a rich and appropriate binding are among 
the book's excellences. (Little, Brown & Co.) 

Mr. Henry C. Lahee has given so much attention 
to the rise of grand opera in this country as to qualify 
him for his latest undertaking, a volume on " The 
Grand Opera Singers of To-day " (Page), the object 
of which, he tells us in his preface, " has been to- 
give some account of the leading singers who have 
been heard in America during the present century." 
But "those whose careers have been touched upon 
in ' Famous Singers of Yesterday and To-day,' and 
in ' Grand Opera in America ' are not mentioned,, 
except perhaps casually, in this book." The histories 
of the leading American opera houses are followed 
with some account of the various singers appearing 
on their stages, and criticisms of these opera singers 
are quoted from authoritative sources. The seven 
chapters deal with the Metropolitan Opera-House 
under Maurice Grau, the same under Heinrich 
Conried, the Manhattan Opera-House under Oscar 
Hammerstein, the Metropolitan (again) under Gatti- 
Casazza and Dippel, the Boston Opera-House under 
Henry Russell, and the Chicago-Philadelphia Com- 
pany under Dippel. The list of singers treated with 
pen and camera within the ample compass of the 
book is too long to be given here. Among the im- 
presarios, the variously gifted and boldly enterpris- 
ing Mr. Hammerstein attracts most attention. A 
short concluding chapter, briefly retrospective and 
forward-looking, ends with the passage from Shaler's 
" Individual " which promises more for the future 
development of music than for any other of the fine 
arts. The book, in its red and gilt binding, and 
with its clear print and numerous portraits of opera 
singers in their characteristic roles, is a notably 
attractive volume. 

Last January Mr. Joseph Pennell went to Panama 
to make drawings of the Canal, and he found, when 
he arrived, that his visit had been well timed for 
catching views of the great works in their most stu- 
pendous stage and before the letting in of the water 
should have partly hidden those marvels of cyclopean 
engineering. A volume of twenty-eight reproduc- 
tions from his original lithographs, preserving as

many views of the " big ditch " and its surroundings 
on the eve of its completion, is the result of his excur- 
sion. "Joseph Pennell's Pictures of the Panama 
Canal " (Lippincott) is the title of the volume, in 
which the artist's pen has cooperated with his pencil 
in conveying some adequate impression of the won- 
ders that confronted him. Picking his points of 
view with an eye to effect, and provided with an 
official pass that left him at liberty to risk his neck 
as boldly as he chose, Mr. Pennell was able to repro- 
duce scenes that no photographer has yet caught ; 
and he has imparted to them the charm and the 
aesthetic suggestion that no camera can capture. His 
Introduction and comments are an excellent aid to 
one's appreciation of both the engineering enterprise 
itself and the artistic undertaking of the undaunted 
sketcher. 

A most engaging and lovable personality was 
that of the late William T. Richards, widely known 
for his paintings of the sea in all its varied moods. 
In Mr. Harrison S. Morris's small volume, " William 
T. Richards: A Brief Outline of his Life and Art" 
{Lippincott), is presented a pleasing portrait of the 
man and artist from the hand of one who knew him 
well and esteemed him highly. Richards was no 
mere painter of pictures; in him was "a touch of 
life beyond the monopolizing palette. . . . He was 
apt in all the pleasant devices of conversation, full 
of humor and quiet laughter, full of diverting stories 
from his travels and his contact with life in many 
countries, and full of that large acquaintance with 
books that furnishes a ripe mind with overflowing 
talk." Fourteen "masterpieces of the sea," as Mr. 
Morris rightly calls them, and one landscape are 
reproduced from Richards's canvases, and portraits 
of the artist and his wife are also given. In all its 
details the book is a handsome piece of work as well 
as an excellent bit of biography. 

HOLIDAY EDITIONS OF STANDARD LITERATURE. 
" The Life of the Bee," that wonderful book of 
M. Maeterlinck's which is neither science nor natural 
history, nor prosaic fact of any sort, but poetry and 
suggestion and beauty, all with a substantial basis 
in truth (which is itself the most suggestive and 
beautiful thing known), comes out again this season 
in a finely-illustrated edition printed on heavy paper 
with generous margins, and ornately bound and 
boxed. The excellence of Mr. Alfred Sutro's lim- 
pid translation is already recognized. The illustra- 
tion, done by Mr. Edward J. Detmold, will be found 
no whit inferior: his flower pictures have the effect 
of water- colors, or rather of nature itself; and his 
bees hovering over them can almost be heard to 
buzz, so that, as in the case of the famous bee 
painted by Quintin Matsys of old, a nervous person 
might be inclined to draw forth pocket-handkerchief 
and flirt them away. There are thirteen of these 
exquisite designs, loosely mounted on heavy tinted 
paper, while the cover further displays the artist's 
skill. In all its appointments this edition of a work 
whose aim is "to speak of the bees very simply, as 



one speaks of a subject one knows and loves to those 
who know it not," is in beautiful accord with the 
high aim of its author. The book is of quarto size, 
which gives ample scope to both printer and illustra- 
tor to do their best work. (Dodd, Mead & Co.) 

In rich holiday attire appears Mr. Kipling's 
" Kim," the orphan lad of Lahore who, though he 
owned a European costume trousers, a shirt, and 
a battered hat "found it easier to slip into Hindu 
or Mohammedan garb when engaged on certain 
businesses," and who, "as he reached the years of 
indiscretion, learned to avoid missionaries and white 
men of serious aspect who asked him who he was and 
what he did. For Kim did nothing with an immense 
success." He knew the wonderful walled city of 
Lahore from end to end, was intimate with men who 
lived stranger lives than were ever dreamt of by 
Haroun al Raschid, and his whole existence was a 
continuous "Arabian Nights" tale. But, remarks 
the author, missionaries and secretaries of charitable 
societies could not see the beauty of it. The beauty 
of it, or at least the interest of it, has nevertheless 
appealed to thousands of readers, and many more 
are likely to be drawn to the story by this handsome 
edition, illustrated with reproductions of the series 
of terra cotta placques designed for the story by the 
author's father, J. Lockwood Kipling, and having as 
end-leaves a colored reproduction of one of Verest- 
chagin's paintings. Colored borders set off the plates, 
which are themselves tinted, and the binding is in 
red and gold. (Doubleday, Page & Co.) 

In a handsome two-volume edition, for which the 
type was entirely reset, and which has sixty-four well- 
chosen illustrations, " The Romance of Leonardo da 
Vinci " reappears in Mr. Herbert Trench's authorized 
translation from the Russian of Dmitri Merejkowski. 
It is ten years since this remarkable romance of a 
great artist's life was first offered to English readers 
by its present publishers (G. P. Putnam's Sons), and 
in that time, as is announced on the reverse of the 
title-page, it has had no fewer than eight re-printings. 
The plates provided for this edition embrace a large 
number of reproductions of Leonardo's paintings and 
of other works of contemporary artists, also portraits 
and views in abundance. The late disappearance 
(and repeatedly reported reappearance) of the famous 
" Mona Lisa " portrait from the Louvre gives especial 
timeliness to this fine edition of the Russian roman- 
cer's book; and his chapter, in the second volume, 
on " Mona Lisa Gioconda " acquires a current inter- 
est apart from its own literary merits. The artist's 
portrait of himself, in the Uffizi Gallery, furnishes 
a frontispiece for the first volume, while his "Mona 
Lisa" performs a like service for the second. The 
volumes are attractively bound in blue and gilt. 

In a new edition, uniform with recent reissues of 
Dean Ramsay's and John Gait's pictures of Scottish 
life and character, there is now revived that classic 
of the early nineteenth century, "The Life of Mansie 
Wauch, Tailor in Dalkeith" (McClurg), by David 
Macbeth Moir, contemporary and friend of John 
Gait and a writer gifted with an exquisite humor

and a deft touch in the portrayal of personal oddi- 
ties. Contributing frequently to " Blackwood's Mag- 
azine " in the twenties in fact it was there that 
" Mansie " made its appearance as a serial Moir 
gained a reputation that was further increased by 
the rapid reissue in edition after edition of his mas- 
terpiece, the book now under consideration. Mansie 
is a most laughably and lovably conceited person, as 
depicted by himself in this his alleged autobiography. 
In the mere record of his birth he cannot conceal 
his foible, for he speaks of his father and mother as 
" little, I daresay, jalousing, at the time their eyes 
first met, that fate had destined them for a pair, 
and to be the honoured parents of me, their only 
bairn." The tremendously important events of 
Mansie's sartorial career, of his courtship and mar- 
riage and all the little domesticities of his life, make 
the richest of reading as told by the chief actor in 
the drama. The book was well worth reviving, and 
in its present handsome form, with colored illustra- 
tions from oil paintings by Mr. Charles Martin 
Hardie, R.S.A., it is a book to own and to keep. 

It is almost half a century since the late John Hay 
struck that vein of popular ballad poetry that proved 
so rich during the short time he worked it. "The 
Pike County Ballads," first collected in an unpreten- 
tious volume that achieved a circulation far smaller 
than it deserved, are now issued in handsome form, 
with illustrations admirably suited to their character, 
by the Houghton Mifflin Company. Mr. N. C. Wyeth 
is the artist, and he prefaces his work with a short in- 
troduction. " I have endeavored," he says, modestly, 
"to add my mite to these already potent lines; to 
lift the curtain intermittently, to draw the veil aside 
cautiously, and look upon the unsuspecting folk of 
Pike County." Seven colored and a greater number 
of uncolored drawings admirably catch the spirit of 
the ballads. On the book's front cover are depicted 
three typical Pike County characters, and the end- 
leaves bear representations of still other specimens 
of the same gentry. 

In a serviceable and beautiful " pocket edition," 
the romances of The'ophile Gautier, translated and 
edited by Professor F. C. de Sumichrast, of Harvard 
University, illustrated with full-page photogravure 
plates of a striking nature, and flexibly but strongly 
bound in limp leather, are issued in a uniform set 
of ten volumes by Messrs. Little, Brown & Co., and 
are offered in sets only. The "Travels " of the same 
author, also translated by Professor de Sumichrast, 
are published in a set of seven volumes, uniform in 
style with the novels, by the same publishers. Any 
one of these seven volumes may be bought separately. 
Introductions, presenting in brief and readable form 
much bibliographical and biographical information 
and occasional critical comment, are supplied by the 
translator. The richness and color of Gautier's style 
seem to have been well reproduced in this version of 
his works, of which the travel volumes especially show 
him to be a master of vivid description, seizing upon 
what is most characteristic in the different countries 
visited. This opportunity to obtain a uniform set 



of his writings in so trustworthy a version and at 
moderate cost should not be neglected either by 
libraries or by individual purchasers. 

In the year following its first appearance, and 
already with a circulation of one hundred and thirty- 
five thousand to its credit, Mr. Jeffery Farad's ro- 
mance, "The Broad Highway," comes forth with its 
charm renewed and heightened in a holiday edition 
printed from new plates, with twenty-four colored 
pictures by Mr. Charles E. Brock, and an additional 
one on the front cover of the artistic binding. Mr. 
Brock's previous work has marked him as an illustra- 
tor quite equal to the task of doing justice to Peter 
and Charmian, Black George and Prue, Sir Maurice 
Vibart, and the Ancient, and the other leading char- 
acters of this vivid romance. Drawing and coloring 
alike are remarkably well done, and not even the 
beautiful heroine herself could have been more ac- 
ceptably conceived. A short preface of thanks to 
his hospitable public is furnished by the author, who 
naturally finds himself in a mood to rejoice that 
the stony and difficult part of the highway over which 
he and Peter have travelled to success and prosperity 
is now well passed. (Little, Brown & Co.) 

" The Burlington Library " (Little, Brown & Co.) 
is well represented this season by two new volumes, 
Keats's "Poems" and Kingsley's "Water-Babies," 
each provided with twenty-four graceful illustrations 
in color, and each also artistically jacketed and 
boxed. Mr. Averil Burleigh's pictures for the Keats 
volume are beautifully drawn. The even distribu- 
tion of the plates through the book, at every six- 
teenth page, as a rule has resulted in a certain 
severance of picture from the poem it illustrates, 
which might have been avoided a slight discord 
that is repeated in "The Water-Babies." Miss 
Ethel F. Everett's colored drawings for this ever- 
popular story show understanding of the author's 
intention and are designed in the true spirit of 
fairy-land. Few if any inexpensive color books can 
match this Burlington series, which now contains 
seven well-chosen volumes. 

Rabelais, in the vigorous seventeenth-century 
English of Sir Thomas Urquhart, and copiously illus- 
trated with appropriate drawings by Mr. W. Heath 
Robinson, appears in a two-volume edition at a 
moderate price. The antique flavor of this time- 
tested version corresponds well with the archaism 
of Rabelais's style, and the humorous conceits of the 
illustrator fall no whit behind the amusing inventions 
of the author. More than one hundred of these draw- 
ings are interspersed. The volumes are tastefully 
and strongly bound. (J. B. Lippincott Co.) 

HOLIDAY ANTHOLOGIES. 

Although Mr. Alfred H. Hyatt's volumes, "The 
Charm of London" and "The Charm of Venice" 
(Jacobs), are compilations as to their reading mat- 
ter, the range and variety of the selections and the 
superior quality of the illustrations (from water- 
colors by Mr. Yoshio Markino and Mr. Harald 
Sund) give the books an excellence not attained by 



454 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



the ordinary holiday publication of this sort. Each 
of the volumes contains about two hundred well- 
chosen extracts in prose and verse from approved 
sources, including American as well as English 
authors. Twelve excellent reproductions of water- 
color drawings are provided for each volume, those 
for London being from Mr. Mariano's brush, those 
for Venice from Mr. Sund's. The Japanese artist's 
style is already familiar to the many readers of his 
books; and Mr. Sund's drawings are equally pleas- 
ing in their way. It is remarkable how carefully 
the former artist, coming of a nation whose art 
seeins to us so devoid of the principle of perspective, 
has rendered the perspective, especially the atmos- 
pheric perspective, in his London scenes. The deli- 
cacy and finish in both sets of illustrations make 
them a delight to the eye. 

For its maximum of wisely-chosen Christmas verse 
within a minimum of space, no compilation of its sort 
could well surpass Mr. Edward A. Bryant's " Yule- 
tide Cheer" (Crowell), which has brought together 
all the familiar old carols and poems of the season, 
and also a good number of the newer and less familiar 
pieces of verse appropriate to the same joyous season 
all arranged according to subject in eight sections, 
"Yule-tide Anticipations," "The Yule Log," " Santa 
Claus and Other Saints," " Christmas Day," " Christ- 
mas in Sacred Song," "Christmas Carols," "New 
Year's," and "Epiphany." Poems as old as the 
Anglo- Norman carol of the thirteenth century, sup- 
posed to be the oldest extant carol in our tongue, 
and as modern as Father Tabb's and Mr. Bliss Car- 
man's Christmas pieces, find a place in the book. To 
the table of contents and the index of titles and first 
lines an index of authors might wisely have been 
added. The little volume is tastefully printed and 
bound and boxed, and has an appropriate frontispiece. 

Of late years, no holiday season has been complete 
without its book on the cheerful art of being happy. 
This season accordingly brings forth an elaborately 
ornamented and at the same time pleasing volume of 
prose and verse selections compiled by Miss Jennie 
Day Haines under the title " A Book of Happiness " 
(Jacobs). Mr. Orison Swett Marden, that indefati- 
gable preacher of the gospel of success, contributes 
the first extract, and Mrs. Browning occupies the 
place of highest honor, at the end of the list. Be- 
tween the two there must be nearly a thousand other 
quotations, short and long, prose and verse, grouped 
in chapters appropriately headed. To the indeter- 
minate "Selected" are credited a considerable num- 
ber of passages. From Leigh Hunt comes one of the 
shortest and best : " It is books that teach us to refine 
our pleasures when young, and to recall them with 
satisfaction when we are old." Whether or not 
happiness will come by taking thought, no more 
attractive book of its sort could be asked for as a 
gift volume. 

The latest but not the least addition to the series 
of volumes devoted to poems of places comes from 
the editorial hand of Mr. J. Walker McSpadden, 
and is called " The Alps as Seen by the Poets " 



( Crowell) . The poems, selected with good j udgment 
from the great poets, and from some of their minor 
fellow-singers, are grouped geographically and in- 
alphabetic order under such headings as Appenzell, 
Berne, Fribourg, Geneva, etc. Sixteen colored views 
of Alpine scenery, bringing out, here and there, some 
admirable effects of light and shade on lofty moun- 
tain peaks, are furnished by Mr. A. D. McCormick, 
Mr. J. Hardwicke Lewis, and Miss May Hardwicke 
Lewis. The cover design is striking and appro- 
priate. The editor has written an introduction, and 
the printer has used his best and clearest type. 

MISCELLANEOUS HOLIDAY BOOKS. 
Chloe, the wife of old Crispin the mushroom- 
gatherer, was "worn to a frazzle" with the care of 
her ten children (all bad but one, Boadicea), and so 
she looked about for a " minder " to relieve her of 
care, and finally sent for her nephew Bill, who cleaned 
the boots. It is the entrancing story of " Bill the 
Minder" which Mr. W. Heath Robinson has told r 
with pen and pencil, " for such youngsters from 
nine to ninety as love their ' Peter Pan ' and 
' Alice in Wonderland.' " No one would have sus- 
pected Bill of having the makings of a good minder 
in him ; hence the surprise and delight with which 
his many and original methods of baby-minding are 
viewed by every appreciative reader. He took to 
the calling with the enthusiasm of an artist. Nat- 
urally, therefore, he carried off all the prizes at "the 
great annual Minding Tournament held by the Duke 
to celebrate his birthday." The astonishing adven- 
j tures of Bill and the children whom he minded, end- 
ing with the siege and capture of Troy, will keep a 
whole family in entertainment for many a winter's 
evening. The pictures sixteen colored plates and 
innumerable line drawings are admirably in har- 
mony with the rollicking, whimsical, delightfully 
absurd tenor of the tale they illustrate : and they 
are, in their way, good art also. The book is of 
large octavo dimensions, handsomely and strongly 
bound and boxed, and printed in the clearest of 
type. It is a veritable treasury of mirth and clever- 
ness. (Holt. ) 

The wholesome delights of an out-door life in the 
summer are pictured with pen and camera in Mrs. 
Frances Kinsley Hutchinson's book, " Our Country 
Life" (McClurg), which is written after a ten years' 
test of that mode of existence on a woodland retreat 
in Wisconsin. Nature-study, especially bird-study, 
chicken-raising, gardening, boating on the near-by 
lake, entertaining visitors, motoring to points of 
interest in the neighborhood, these and similar 
health-giving pursuits and recreations fill the days 
of Mrs. Hutchinson and her household during the 
long vacation season ; and sometimes they seek the 
retreat for a breathing-spell in the winter also. A 
glance at the chapter-headings of her book will 
excite desire to explore its pages. In an engaging 
manner the author tells of her garden, the bantams r 
the lake, the exhilarating experience of sleeping 
under the stars, the country in winter, the story of 



1912.J 



THE

Nan (a motherless bird), the little daily doings of 
the family, and so on. A multitude of photographic 
views, charming bits of rurality, including various 
aspects of the foliage-embowered and vine-clad 
home of the writer, make the book most attractive 
to the eye. There is a veritable riot of vegetation 
in these pictures, though the primness of one formal 
garden is also exhibited. The volume is fittingly 
bound in green, with end-leaves depicting green 
lawn and spreading trees, and a low-roofed building 
in the background. 

A picture-book of children, for lovers of children, 
with accompanying verses by Mr. Burges Johnson, 
comes from the Thomas Y. Crowell Co. in sumptuous 
quarto form, with the title "Childhood." The pic- 
tures, twenty in number, are full-page plates from 
photographs taken by Cecilia Bull Hunter and Caro- 
line Ogden, and present as many aspects of happy 
infancy and early childhood, with occasional accom- 
panying glimpses of motherhood and grandmother- 
hood. In a vein not unlike that of Eugene Field, 
Mr. Johnson furnishes appropriate lines for each 
illustration. The verses are printed in brown on 
heavy paper, with ornamental initial letters and a 
simple page-border. The illustration to each set of 
verses follows it on the next right-hand page, being 
loosely attached and bordered with brown. The left- 
hand pages are blank inviting additional rhymes 
or pictures, or both, from home talent and based on 
home themes. A large outdoor scene, with a sturdy 
urchin in the foreground, ornaments the cover, which 
itself is in light-brown cloth, artistically stamped in 
gilt. This is just the book for the young mother 
and the growing family, and is not without attrac- 
tions for the old who have once been children 
themselves. 

Every landscape has as many aspects as it has 
beholders. The Swiss views which we see through 
Mr. G. Flemwell's eyes in his exquisitely-illustrated 
volume, " The Flower-Fields of Switzerland " 
(Dodd), are by no means the same as those pic- 
tured in any of the several other noteworthy Swit- 
zerland books of the present season. Mr. Flemwell 
is a flower-lover, a flower-painter, and a botanist. 
He writes the flower-names with capital initial letters 
in his book, and he sees flowers as the chief feature 
of the landscape. Hence his beautiful colored pic- 
tures of Swiss mountain slopes and brooksides and 
nooks and corners are resplendent with nature's 
choicest hues. His earlier work, " Alpine Flowers 
and Gardens," met with deserved success, but left un- 
treated those aspects of the Alpine fields, especially 
in spring, which have won his enthusiastic admira- 
tion, and which he now so admirably reproduces. 
Each view, loosely mounted on heavy paper, is like 
a water-color for delicacy. Flower effects, in mass 
at a distance, and in detail in the foreground, are 
given with unusual skill, and the accompanying com- 
ment and description from his pen are in good taste. 
He closes with a plea for the introduction of this 
feature of Alpine loveliness into England, where 
the daisy, the buttercup, and the dandelion might 



well be supplemented by many examples of the Swiss 
wild-flowers. Mr. Henry Correvon, horticulturist at 
Floraire near Geneva, and a friend of the author, 
prefaces the book, which contains reproductions of 
twenty-five of the author-painter's water-colors, not 
counting the one on the cover. It is one of the most 
strikingly beautiful volumes of the season. 

Two of the late Katharine Prescott Wormeley's 
most important translations from the French 
"Illustrious Dames of the Court of the Valois 
Kings" and "The Ruin of a Princess" are now, 
a dozen years after their first appearance in an 
edition too expensive for popular purchase, repub- 
lished in handsome but less costly form, with all the 
original illustrations, and with no curtailment of 
text, by the Lamb Publishing Company. It is from 
Brantome's "Vies des Dames Illustres" and "Vies 
des Dames Galantes,"with Sainte-Beuve's "Monday 
Chats " on five of the chosen dames, that the trans- 
lator has drawn her material for the first-named 
work ; and from Madame Elisabeth, the Duchesse 
d'Angouleme, and Cl^ry, Louis the Sixteenth's valet, 
that she gets her account of " the ruin of a princess," 
that unfortunate lady being Madame Elisabeth her- 
self. Brant6me's style, his ingenuous frankness in 
recording various sorts of rascality perpetrated by 
his contemporaries, need not here be commented on. 
It makes brisk and not seldom amusing reading. 
The pathos in the undeserved tribulations of the 
heroine of the other work will appeal to every 
reader not wholly bereft of pity. The well-known 
smoothness and trustworthiness of Miss Wormeley's 
rendition have contributed much to the popularity 
of the many works bearing her name as translator. 
The two volumes here named are uniform in style, 
each having eight photogravures, and each being 
excellently printed and handsomely bound in blue 
and gold. 

Our ever-increasing interest in the Land of the 
Rising Sun, a land that has so recently emerged 
from the semi-darkness of her mediaevalism into the 
glare of modernity, makes welcome and timely such 
a variously informing and curiously entertaining 
volume as Mr. F. Hadland Davis's "Myths and 
Legends of Japan" (Crowell). It is the fruit of 
careful study and wide reading, the now sufficiently 
numerous standard authorities on things Japanese 
having been pressed into service in the compiling 
of the book. No country has a richer folklore than 
Japan, and Mr. Davis's chapter-headings alone con- 
vey some idea of its range and variety. He has 
collected the noteworthy legends concerning the 
national heroes and warriors, the fox that so often 
figures in popular tales, the majestic Mount Fuji- 
yama ("the Never-dying Mountain"), Yuki-onna 
("the Lady of the Snow"), dolls, butterflies, fans, 
thunder, tea, birds, trees, mirrors, bells, and innu- 
merable other things; and there are added a brief 
treatise on Japanese poetry, a list of the native divini- 
ties, a bibliography, an index of poetical quotations, 
and, finally, a combined glossary and index to the 
entire work. Miss Evelyn Paul has produced thirty-

two colored pictures in which she is remarkably 
successful in embodying that indefinable quality at 
once recognized as so peculiarly pleasing in native 
illustration. She has made the book a thing of beauty 
as well as one of entertainment and instruction. 

An artist's wife, herself a woman of letters, 
assumes, for the first time apparently, the cares 
and responsibilities of a housewife in London, and 
straightway has a succession of memorable and 
frequently harrowing experiences with her domes- 
tics. Beggars, too, of many sorts, but chiefly of the 
most respectable appearance, help to vary the mo- 
notony of her existence. " Our House, and London 
out of Our Windows" (Houghton), by Mrs. Joseph 
Pennell, with pictures by Mr. Pennell, tells ,in a 
sprightly fashion the story of this experiment at 
home making under unfamiliar conditions. The 
"house" was in reality a flat, three flights up and 
with a command of sundry picturesque views of 
roofs and river and busy street views that the 
artist has turned to account, in his well-known 
manner, for the further enlivening of his wife's 
already lively narrative. Sixteen of these glimpses 
of "London out of our windows" are offered, de- 
picting with Mr. Pennell's customary charm and 
skill many of the most characteristic aspects, both 
by day and by night, of the greatest of modern cities. 
In this new and handsome edition, with the added 
attraction of Mr. Pennell's illustrations, the book 
is sure to find the wide circle of readers which it so 
well deserves. 

A stern parent, or one who tries to be stern, a 
pretty and rather saucily self-reliant daughter, an 
ardent and determined lover, a steam yacht belong- 
ing to the stern parent, some blue ocean, a transac- 
tion in real estate these and sundry other persons 
and things, skilfully compounded and flavored with 
sentiment, spiced with wit, and embellished with 
the illustrator's art, go to make up Mr. Ralph Henry 
Barbour's annual demonstration of the incontro- 
vertible truth that "love will find a way." The 
tale is of the briskly entertaining sort, with an 
abundance of spirited dialogue and a sufficiency of 
incident, and its title is "The Harbor of Love." 
Mr. George W. Plank illustrates it in color, and 
Mr. Edward S. Holloway supplies the decorative 
page-borders and other ornamentation. (J. B. 
Lippincott Co.) 

A little tale of courtship and marriage and par- 
enthood amid surroundings of rural simplicity and 
beauty and quiet is told by Miss Clarice Vallette 
McCauley in "The Garden of Dreams " (McClurg). 
A prologue and a series of letters, chiefly from the 
hero to a sympathetic woman friend, with others 
from the heroine to her dead father and other per- 
sons not dead, unfold the drama, and we take leave 
of the happy pair rejoicing over the birth of a son. 
Miranda is the appropriate name of the unspoilt 
maiden whom the Ferdinand of the romance 
though that is not his name wooes and wins. The 
little volume is tastefully printed, with tinted page- 
borders, and an ornamental binding

NOTES. 



Mr. Reginald Wright Kauffman has now nearly 
completed a new novel, to be entitled " Judith Kent, 
Freewoman." 

"' Bunker Bean " is the title of Mr. Harry Leon Wil- 
son's new novel, which Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. 
will publish in January. 

"John, Jonathan and Company," by Mr. James Milne, 
being an Englishman's impressions of America, will be 
published at once by the Macmillan Co. 

Dr. Charles F. Thwing, president of Western Reserve 
University, has made a thorough revision of his work, 
" The Family," which will be published early next year 
by Lothrop, Lee & Shepard Co. 

We learn from Mr. Manly's Introduction to the new 
collected edition of the work of William Vaughn Moody 
that a volume of Moody's letters is soon to be published, 
"under the care of one of his most intimate friends." 

" Mr. Achilles " by Mrs. Jeunette Lee, recently 
brought out in book form by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co., 
is to be published shortly in an edition for the blind. Mrs. 
Lee's previous stories, " Uncle William " and " Happy 
Island," have also been brought out in this way. 

Two important volumes on opposite sides of the 
Home Rule Question, to be issued immediately by 
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co., are " Aspects of Home 
Rule," a collection of speeches by the Right Hon. A. J. 
Balfour; and "Dublin Castle and the Irish People," 
by Mr. Barry O'Brien. 

Sophie Swett, a talented writer of children's books, 
died on November 12 at Arlington Heights, Mass. She 
was at one time associate editor of " Wide Awake," a 
prominent children's magazine of a generation ago, and 
is the author of some forty books for young people. 

Still another effort toward solving the "Edwin Drood" 
mystery has been made, this time by Sir W. Robertson 
Nicoll, whose contribution to the subject will be published 
by the George H. Doran Co. under the title " The Prob- 
lem of Edwin Drood: A Study in the Methods of Charles 
Dickens." 

" The Happy Warrior " is the title of a new novel 
by Mr. A. S. M. Hutehinsou, author of " Once Aboard 
the Lugger," which Messrs. Little, Brown & Co. will 
publish in January. This house has also in press 
for January publication " Joyful Heatherby " by Mrs. 
Payne Erskine, and " The Little Gray Shoe " by Mr. 
Percy J. Brebner. 

The many teachers and others who followed with 
interest the newspaper reports of the lectures given at 
the Columbia Summer School this year by Dr. W. H. D. 
Rouse, the well-known English classicist, will be inter- 
ested in knowing that Dr. Rouse's three elementary 
Greek books, "A First Greek Course," "A Greek 
Reader," and " A Greek Boy at Home," have been pub- 
lished in the United States by Charles E. Merrill Com- 
pany, by arrangement with Messrs. Blackie & Son, the 
English publishers. 

An opportunity for ambitious young essayists to try 
their pens on a subject worthy of their best efforts is 
extended by the Lake Mohonk Conference on Interna- 
tional Arbitration, which offers a prize of one hundred 
dollars for the best essay by an undergraduate male 
student of any college or university in the United States 
or Canada, on " International Arbitration." Essays 
should not exceed five thousand words in length, and it 
is preferred that they be typewritten. An understand-

ing of the nature and history of international arbitration, 
and of the Hague Conference and Court, must be shown 
by the writer. The contest closes the fifteenth of next 
March. Further particulars will be furnished upon ap- 
plication by Mr. H. C. Phillips, secretary, Mohonk Lake, 
Ulster County, N. Y. 

The lectures delivered at Columbia University last 
spring by Sir Gilbert Murray, Regius Professor of 
Greek in Oxford University, will be published this 
month by the Columbia University Press, under the title 
"Four Stages of Greek Religion." The Press also an- 
nounces for immediate publication " Literary Influences 
in Colonial Newspapers, 1704-1750," by Elizabeth 
Christine Cook, Ph.D. 

M. Remain Rolland is just finishing his " Jean Chris- 
tophe " and intends to entitle the last of the ten volumes 
of the French edition " La Fin du Voyage." He had 
earlier thought of calling that volume " Une Nouvelle 
Journe'e." The concluding volume, which Messrs. Holt 
will issue simultaneously with Mr. Heinemann, in 
London, will contain the last three volumes of the 
French edition, and is likely to appear in February. 

Professor W. H. Schofield, Harvard Exchange Pro- 
fessor at the University of Paris in 1911, has prepared 
for publication a series of lectures which he delivered 
at the Sorbonne and at the University of Copenhagen. 
The volume will be entitled " Chivalry in English Litera- 
ture " and will trace the growth of the ideal of chivalry 
as it is illustrated in the works of Chaucer, Malory, 
Spenser, and Shakespeare. The book is announced for 
immediate publication by Harvard University. 

In the sudden death, on November 25, of Frank Hall 
Scott, president of The Century Co., the American pub- 
lishing trade loses one of its ablest and most energetic 
members. Mr. Scott was born in Terre Haute, Indiana, 
in 1848. He entered the office of " Scribner's Monthly " 
in 1870, and in 1893 became president of The Century 
Co., which position he has held since that time. A prom- 
inent member of the American Publishers Association, 
he has been active in all good works having the better- 
ment of the book trade for their object. His frequent 
visits to London gave him opportunity for personal ac- 
quaintance with the foremost writers and artists of his 
day, by whom he was held in affectionate regard. 

The passing of a famous publisher is noted with 
regret in the recent death of William Blackwood, grand- 
son of the founder of the house of William Blackwood 
and Sons, and a man so well known among writers and 
with so many memorable experiences to record in his 
diary (if he kept one, as is now hoped to have been the 
case) that a volume of very readable reminiscences ought 
to be forthcoming at the hands of his literary executor. 
His success with the magazine that came into his hands 
with his assumption of the management of the business 
a generation ago was not the least of his triumphs. 
" Blackwood's " is an object of especial interest to us 
by reason of its having served as a model for our fore- 
most literary monthly when Lowell and Fields were 
planning that noteworthy undertaking more than half a 
century ago, and both magazines have had to contend 
with the difficulties arising from the recent remarkable 
vogue of the low-priced illustrated monthly. The late 
Mr. Blackwood was a man of culture, educated at 
Glasgow University, the Sorbonne, and Heidelberg, and 
was esteemed an accomplished letter-writer by his cor- 
respondents. A selection from his letters, if nothing 
more, ought to be given to the public at an early date.

Four Lectures on Chaucer, Malory. Spenser and 
Shakespeare, delivered in French at the Sorbonne

" My object in these lectures." the author explains, 
"is to show how the ideal of French chivalry en- .

the attitude of the English-speaking world. . . . 
I shall endeavor, in sum, to indicate the genesis of 
the idea conveyed by the English word 'gentleman,'

'Undoubtedly The Book of the Season' -The Dial 

The Letters of George Meredith 

Edited by HIS SON 
Two Volumes. $4.00 net; by mail $4.28 

The London Spectator: 

" The range of these six hundred and thirty pages of Meredith's correspondence is so enormous 
that it is difficult to make up one's mind at what point to approach it. The volume of Meredith's 
personality was immense, and here we see it in full flood through sixty strenuous years. Every 
line is animated by his wonderful relish and curiosity for life. On every page there waves his 
banner, and beneath it rumbles and flashes all the artillery of his passionate and brilliant eloquence." 

The Bookman : 

"He had all the gifts of a superior letter writer: grace, variety, and vision: devoid of self- 
consciousness and with no weather-eye cocked on posterity and the reviewer's table. Here are 
no obscurities ; but clear flashing phrases which fill the depths with meaning. These letters reveal 
more than any commentary on his work ; they disclose, too, the man of wide restless interests whose 
mind searched endlessly during his long life for the roots of art, literature, science, and government." 

New York Times : 

" That the collected letters of Meredith are one of the richest gifts of the press to the current 
year seems to have been conceded by every reviewer." 

Philadelphia Public Ledger: "They open a window into the mind of the man." 

Boston Transcript : 

" Two volumes that disclose the workings of the mind of a genius. There is scarcely a line 
of them that need be overlooked, for they prove that a writer of Meredith's calibre is frequently, 
consciously or unconsciously, in the finest of creative or critical moods when he is writing merely 
for the personal eye of a friend."

One of the most striking episodes of Modern History described by 

FREDERICK WELLS WILLIAMS, Assistant Professor of Oriental History in Yale University 

With frontispiece. $2.00 net; by mail $2.19 

New York Tribune : " Professor Williams's book is a historical account of Burlingame's work in China 
as American Minister Plenipotentiary, and for China as the head of her first foreign mission to this 
country, England, France, Germany, Russia ... a capital character study." 

Boston Transcript : "All in all, Mr. Burlingame was one of the most remarkable diplomats this

and large value." 



The Mortal Gods, and Other Dramas 
By OLIVE TILFORD DARGAN 

$1.50 net; by mail $1.65 

A new book of poetic dramas by Mrs. Dargan, whose pre- 
vious volumes, " Lords and Lovers and Other Dramas '' and 
" Semiramis," have given her not only a position in the first 
rank of American poets, but a position peculiarly her own. 
"A Son of Hermes " is a drama of the time of Alcibiades, 
" The Sword of Love," one of the Crusades in the twelfth 
century, and " The Mortal Gods " deals with current social 
philosophy in an imaginary country. 

Plays by Anton Tchekoff 

"Uncle Vanya, " "Ivanhoff, " "The Sea-Gull, " 
and "The Swan Song " 

Translated from the Russian by MARIAN FELL 

Frontispiece. 12mo. $1.50 net; postpaid $1.65 
These four plays, by one of the greatest of modern Russians, 
whom Tolstoi declared to be comparable only to Maupas- 
sant, show not only the range and depth of his astonishing 
genius, but they give a picture of Russian life unequalled 
since Turge"meff. Three of the plays are here translated 
for the first time into English. 



The Poetical Works of 
George Meredith 

With Some Notes by G. M. TREVELYAN 

With portrait. $2. 00 net; by mail $2. 19 
George Meredith was one of the great poets in the succession 
of English poetic masters. It is therefore right that all of 
his poetry should be made available in one volume by which 
his eminence can be appreciated and judged. 

By JOHN GALSWORTHY 

The Eldest Son 

A Domestic Drama in Three Acts 

60 cents net; postpaid 70 cents 

This drama, with an English country house for its setting, 
has all the concentrated power of " Strife " and " Justice." 
Constructively it is perfect : without a pause in the action, 
the situation depending on the entanglement of " the 
eldest son " is exposed, and the characters, drawn from 
the upper and lower classes, are introduced. 

The Inn of Tranquillity 

On Life and On Letters 

$1.30 net; by mail $1.42 

In the papers on Life Mr. Galsworthy reproduces incidents, 
mainly of London street or English village, of intense in- 
dividual interest; but more and this is probably the 
purpose he gives the feeling of the great natural forces 
of social evolution at work under the surface. Each story 
carries distinct social significance. The papers on Letters 
give the writer's artistic creed.

THE CASE OF POETRY. 

In the conditions of current literary activity 
there are symptoms of a desire to do something 
for poetry. It is a laudable desire, although its 
full justification depends upon the assumption 
that poetry is in need of coddling, and upon 
the further assumption that encouragement or 
incentive will be likely to increase its amount 
and improve its quality. As far as increasing 
its amount is concerned, we have grave doubts 
of the wisdom of any concerted propaganda. 
A large acquaintance with such nurslings of 
the muses as may be generically described as 
" Badger poets" has made us perhaps unduly 
pessimistic. Some hundreds of volumes of 
metrical exercises labelled poetry come under 
our observation every year, and we can only 
say of them with Othello, " But yet the pity of 
it!" The combination of misguided taste with 
overweening conceit which alone can account 
for these vapid outpourings is one of the least 
lovely phenomena of human nature, and we 
endure its manifestations only because of the 
hope that springs eternal in the critic's breast, 
the hope that this stagnant corruption may 
perchance blossom when we least expect it into 
some miraculous flower of song. The hope is 
sometimes fulfilled, as it was once with us in 
glorious measure when an uninviting volume 
came to our hand, eliciting at the first glance 
only some such reflection as " another tiresome 
allegory, "but upon closer examination revealing 
such wonders of beauty as we had not dared to 
dream our age and country capable of produc- 
ing. For that volume was "The Masque of 
Judgment," and it made us understand how a 
lover of poetry must have felt in 1667, discov- 
ering for himself "Paradise Lost," or in 1820, 
opening the pages of " Prometheus Unbound."

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



Genius prepares such surprises for the world 
from time to time, and no age is too prosaic to 
admit of their possibility. 

We would not then say a word in deprecation 
of any earnest effort to provoke the poetic spirit 
into activity, although the fruits of such an effort 
are likely to prove for the most part innutritive 
and insipid. The only thing that gives us pause 
in the contemplation of such stimuli as are 
offered to poets in the way of prizes or of oppor- 
tunities for publicity, is the question whether any 
such encouragements are likely to evoke song in 
cases where silence would otherwise obtain, or 
whether their application has any potency to en- 
dow the singer with a higher rapture or a more 
authentically creative expression than would in 
any case be his. 

" In far retreats of elemental mind 
Obscurely comes and goes 
The imperative breath of song," 

and inward compulsion rather than outward 
incentive seems to be the law of its being. The 
history of "prize poetry," on the one hand, and 
the history of genius in its struggle with adver- 
sity, on the other, provide reasonable confirma- 
tion of this view. 

The effort "to do something for poetry" is 
signalized this year by the launching of two little 
magazines devoted to the interests of this art. 
" The Poetry Review," of English origin, is 
" devoted to the study and appreciation of 
modern poetry of all countries," and, beginning 
with next January, will change its periodicity, 
becoming a quarterly instead of a monthly, thus 
coming into comparison with our own quarterly 
" Poet-Lore," which has maintained its noble 
cause for many years. It will also open in 
London a bookshop for the sale of poetry, in 
which " purchases will be strictly optional." 
The other new venture is Miss Harriet Monroe's 
" Poetry," the delightful little monthly published 
in Chicago, to which we have previously called 
attention. Being generously subsidized, this 
periodical is assured of at least five years in 
which to further its aims, and we trust that the 
end of that term will find it standing securely 
on its own feet. If it does not succeed in evok- 
ing anything new and strange, it will at least 
have served to bring together in convenient 
form a considerable quantity of the best current 
verse. Speaking of the fear expressed in some 
quarters that it " may become a house of refuge 
for minor poets," Miss Monroe makes some 
pointed remarks : " Paragraphers have done 
their worst for the minor poet, while they have 
allowed the minor painter, sculptor, actor 



worst of all, architect to go scot-free. The 
world which laughs at the experimenter in verse 
walks negligently through our streets, and goes 
seriously, even reverently, to the annual exhibi- 
tions in our cities, examining hundreds of pic- 
tures and statues without expecting even the 
prize-winners to be masterpieces." The point 
is well taken, although we find the term " minor '' 
a convenient one for the expression of a fact, 
and would rather see its use extended to the 
other arts than tabooed when speaking of poetry. 
Of course, no artist quite relishes having his 
work dubbed with this adjective, but the poet 
who resents being classified as "minor " may be 
glad that he is called nothing worse. When 
Mr. Slason Thompson some years ago published 
an anthology, which he styled " The Humbler 
Poets,'' he discovered that several of the men 
whom he had honored by inclusion nursed a 
decided grievance, and he was the recipient of 
letters from them indignantly denying that they 
were "humble." 

In projecting what he calls " The Lyric Year," 
Mr. Mitchell Kennerley, a New York publisher, 
has undertaken an extremely interesting experi- 
ment in poetical encouragement. The volume 
for 1912, now published, is thus introduced by 
the editor : 

" If the usual volume of verse by a single author may 
be termed a one man's show, if poems appearing in the 
magazines may be compared to paintings handled by 
dealers, if time-honored anthologies may be called poet- 
ical museums, ' The Lyric Year ' aspires to the position 
of an Annual Exhibition or Salon of American poetry, 
for it presents a selection from one year's work of a 
hundred American poets." 

Since this publication was widely heralded, and 
since with the announcement went an offer of 
three prizes aggregating one thousand dollars, 
we are not surprised to be informed that nearly 
two thousand poets submitted works to the jury, 
and that no less than ten thousand poems were 
entered in the competition. The result as now 
published thus represents the winnowing away of 
ninety-nine per cent of chaff, each of the poems 
printed being but one out of a hundred of those 
submitted. 

A peculiarly gratifying feature of this exhibit 
is found in the fact that it includes so many of 
our best-known names. It is to be feared that 
all our living poets (now that Moody is no more) 
are "minor," but there are degrees of minority, 
and if we may venture to suggest such a thing 
as "an emerged tenth/' we should perhaps find 
it in the following list of those here represented : 
Mr. Carman, Mr. Cawein, Mr. Markham, Mr. 
Scollard, Mr. Torrence, Mr. Woodberry, Mrs. 



1912.] 



THE DIAL 



479 



Dargan, Mrs. Dorr, Miss Peabody, and Miss 
Thomas. In making this invidious selection, we 
mean to intimate merely that these ten have per- 
haps more firmly-established reputations than 
the remaining ninety, and not that their work is 
necessarily finer than that of many among the 
others. And nothing about the whole matter is 
more striking than the fact that the three prize 
awards do not go where we would have thought 
it a priori probable that they would go, but 
instead to three men whose names are absolutely 
unknown to the general reading public. And 
yet, comparing with the others these prize poems 
of Mr. Orrick Johns, Mr. Thomas Augustine 
Daly, and Mr. George Sterling, we cannot fairly 
say that the distinction awarded them is unde- 
served. If they are not clearly superior to all 
the others, we should hesitate to say that any of 
the others overtopped them. And it is, on the 
whole, extremely gratifying that three unknown 
men should emerge to head the list in such a 
competition as this. Mr. Orrick Johns, whose 
poem is thus adjudged the best of the ten thou- 
sand submitted, is a youth of twenty-five; he 
has now become a marked man, and has only 
to fulfil the promise of this poem to become a 
famous one. 

In one matter only, we are inclined to say 
a word of adverse criticism concerning this 
anthology. When the editor confesses that in 
his selection he " has endeavored to give prefer- 
ence to poems fired with the Time spirit and 
marked by some special distinction, rather than 
mere technical performances," we think that he 
has gone astray. We should like, did space 
permit, to enlarge upon this thesis, but will be 
content with referring instead to Mr. Hermann 
Hagedorn's "Note on Contemporary Poetry" in 
"The North American Review'' for December, 
which convincingly refutes the critical heresy 
above confessed. As this writer justly says : 

" A poet need not limit himself to-day, any more than 
in the time of Homer, to the stories and the background 
of his own age, to speak to it truths which the man in 
the street will admit are vital, real. Unless he be a rare 
anachronism, he will express his age unconsciously, even 
though he sing of the Seven Buried Cities of Cibola." 

Quoting from a Japanese critic who says that 
" American poets bother too much with social 
reform and what not," Mr. Hagedorn further 
observes that " social reform is matter for 
sociology or any other science that deals with 
the passing manifestations of life, not for 
poetry. . . . For art, at its best, is not an 
escape from life nor a criticism of life, but an 
expansion of life into regions which ordinary 
human experience cannot otherwise reach." 



This argument, coupled with the editor's con- 
fession, makes us feel a vague suspicion that 
among the poems rejected under the false canon 
there may have been some that would have 
raised the average excellence of " The Lyric 
Year," high as that average now is. In any 
such selection, Art, rather than the expression 
of the Zeitgeist, should be looked to for the 
decisive test. 

CASUAL COMMENT. 



NOISE AND THE BOOK-TRADE AND SOME OTHER 

THINGS are interrelated in a curious manner. Paris, 
with its steam trams, its gigantic, iron-tired, steam 
motor-trucks, and its boisterous fetes foraines, or, 
freely translated, Coney Islands on wheels not 
to speak of a hundred other noise- producers has 
achieved the unenviable fame of being the least 
quiet city in the world, or, which is the same thing, 
worse than New York for quantity and quality and 
variety of din. So horrid is the uproar that one can 
no longer saunter with any pleasure up and down 
the boulevards, or along the quays where the book- 
booths used to invite to blissful quarter-hour of 
browsing among rare early editions or other succu- 
lent herbage of the literary sort. Hence the book- 
dealers and others are organizing a chapter in the 
vigorous young society of the Friends of Silence. 
Book-writing, no less than book-reading and book- 
selling, is interfered with by noise, and authors, 
especially if they be city-dwellers, should be among 
the first and the most active of the members in this 
anti-racket confederation. They cannot all afford 
the luxury of a sound-proof study, h la Carlyle, 
even if sound-proof studies were really sound-proof, 
which, unless they are suspended in vacua, they 
cannot be. Mr. Henry Wellington Wack, of the 
New York Bar, at a recent meeting of the Psycho- 
logical Section of the Medico-Legal Society, made 
a vigorous remonstrance against unnecessary noises 
in cities, pointing out the nervous and other disor- 
ders caused thereby, and the waste of energy, as 
well as of health and comfort, attributable thereto. 
The nervous belt of the United States he makes 
to extend in width from Boston on the north to 
Washington on the south, and thence across the 
continent; and "this is the region of noise, neuras- 
thenia, hysteria, brain-storms, mythomania, nerve- 
specialists, money madness, and the asbestos con- 
science." Eliminate avoidable noises, and the life 
of the average city-dweller would be prolonged 
seven years as the life-insurance actuaries will 
tell you. " But the average resident of large cities 
has had his auditory nerves so coarsened, and has 
trained his voice so harshly, that he is more con- 
scious of the absence than the presence of noise. 
In other words, he does not feel normal unless the 
varied stimuli of noise are at play upon his senses. 
Deprive him of this noise-cocktail and he becomes 
somnolent; thinks he is dying." Thus Mr. Wack.

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



Our urban public libraries are not the least sufferers 
from street noises ; their reading-rooms, especially 
in summer when the windows are open, have more 
of pandemonium about them than the "still air of 
delightful studies." ... 

Or THOSE WHO KNOW NOT THE PUBLIC LIBBABT 

the number is larger than librarians like to admit 
even to themselves. But the proportion of these non- 
users to the users of this beneficent institution is cer- 
tainly diminishing, in our own country at least. The 
latest report of the Springfield (Mass.) City Library 
tells us that " the whole number of cardholders en- 
rolled in the present series, which began December 
15, 1908, is 30,665. This figure does not include 
the many persons served by the deposit system, of 
whom no statistics are available." Springfield's pop- 
ulation, as given by the census of 1910, is 88,926. 
Thus it seems to be safe to conclude that at least one- 
third of the inhabitants of that typical New England 
city are library-users. In Boston, whose census fig- 
ures for population are 670,585, and whose regis- 
tration figures in the year following that census were 
86,913, the library-users appear to number less than 
thirteen per cent of the inhabitants. In the Balti- 
more ''Sun" there has just come to our notice a 
letter to the editor deploring the small ness of the 
number of persons registered as book-borrowers at 
the Enoch Pratt Free Library, which is virtually the 
public library of the city. Lament is made that 
" only about five per cent " of the population are 
thus registered. Of course there are in Baltimore 
other beside public libraries that serve many stu- 
dents and readers, as there are in Boston and 
Springfield, and statistics of all sorts are notoriously 
deceptive ; but the official announcement of such an 
encouraging state of things as is met with in the 
Springfield Report is always pleasant to read. 



A MEMORABLE FRIENDSHIP was that between 
Lowell and Charles Eliot Norton. Many of Lowell's 
letters to Norton to "Ciarli" as he playfully called 
him in Italian spelling are to be found in the two 
rich volumes of Lowell's correspondence. Some of 
those written by Norton in reply are now made 
public in the record of the " Letters of Friendship " 
series appearing in "The Atlantic Monthly" and 
composed of selections from Norton's letters to those 
with whom he was most intimate. Using at first the 
more formal opening, " My dear Lowell," Norton 
soon changed this to "My dear James" and then 
" My dearest James," becoming warmly affectionate 
and receiving no lesser warmth in return. In a 
letter of December, 1861, from New York we note 
the following: "How good the new number of the 
Atlantic is! I have read and reread your letters 
in it, always with a fuller sense of the overflowing 
humor, wit, and cleverness of them. You are as 
young, my boy, as you were in the old time." And 
in one written soon after Lowell's appointment as 
Minister to England, the following is significant: "It 
is an immense mistake, it seems to me, to think it 



necessary to live at a great expense as Ambassador. 
You can live with dignity and propriety in London 
on the Minister's salary, and be just as much liked 
as if you spent double, and more respected. I think 
Motley never gained by his lavishness, but on the 
contrary exposed himself to criticism that was not 
unfounded." At the time of the appearance of 
"Leaves of Grass" Norton speaks in praise of it, 
and adds: "It is a book which has excited Emer- 
son's enthusiasm. He has written a letter to this 
'one of the roughs' which I have seen, expressing 
the warmest admiration and encouragement. It is 
no wonder he likes it, for Walt Whitman has read 
the Dial and Mature, and combines the character- 
istics of a Concord philosopher with those of a New 
York fireman." For other good things in this series 
of letters the reader will be glad to consult the De- 
cember "Atlantic." . . . 

A PUBLISHER OF THE OLD SCHOOL has passed away 
in the recent death of Mr. Frank Hall Scott, who had 
enjoyed four decades of activity in the publishing 
business in New York, almost half of that time being 
president of the Century Company. "Enjoyed" is 
here used advisedly, Mr. Scott's discharge of his 
duties having nothing of the perfunctory about it. 
Filled with a sense of the publisher's responsibility 
to the public, he seems to have regarded the business 
of issuing books as a sort of educational crusade. 
What there was in it, pecuniarily, for him, appears 
to have been his last thought. Toward authors, espe- 
cially young and struggling authors, he showed a 
friendly bearing and at times a most unprofessional 
tenderness of heart. An obituary notice of him tells 
of his final acceptance of an already declined manu- 
script. The writer was a woman. Calling upon Mr. 
Scott after that gentleman had endeavored to make 
her aware that her literary offering was not desired, 
she pleaded her cause so well that when the publisher 
came out from the interview he bore her manuscript 
in his hand and told his associate, "I've had to take 
it." "Had to?" queried the other. "Why, how 
did you come to do that? " " She wept so. What is 
more, she used up her own handkerchief and had to 
borrow mine to weep in. I couldn't stand that. I 
guess we can sell a few copies." Mr. Scott was a 
Hoosier by birth, a graduate of the Pennsylvania 
Military Academy, a holder of the honorary degree 
of L.H. D. from Marietta College, a director of the 
American Publishers' Association, and was sixty-four 
years old at the time of his death.

THE POSSIBLE SOLUTION OF A LINGUISTIC MYS- 
TERY is presented in the new theory propounded by 
Professor Jules Martha of the Sorbonne as to the 
character of the ancient Etruscan language, that 
baffling problem of philology that has puzzled 
scholars for many a century. It appears that he 
has traced certain resemblances, both in vocabulary 
and in syntax and inflections, between the tongues 
of the so-called agglutinative group of languages 
which includes the speech of the Finn, of the Lap,

and of the Hungarian and the hitherto untranslat- 
able language of the prehistoric dweller in Tuscany. 
Following this scent, he is reported to have de- 
ciphered the meaning of a number of Etruscan 
inscriptions, among them being certain contracts for 
the sale of land and a prayer to the god of healing ; 
and he has also succeeded in interpreting the least 
illegible of the writings on the wrappings of the cele- 
brated mummy in the museum at Agram in Croatia. 
This mummy is of the time of the Ptolemies, but 
not Egyptian in its wrappings and inscriptions ; and 
the latter are found by Professor Martha to be a 
ritual for the use of sailors. If the key to Etruscan 
inscriptions has thus really been found, it will be a 
discovery of great importance ; and if at the same 
time light is thrown on the anomalous group of 
modern languages to which the Etruscan is said to 
bear a striking resemblance, the possible outcome of 
it all will be doubly interesting. 


THE CUMULATIVE BATE OF A LIBRARY'S GROWTH 

in these days when the multiplication of books goes on 
in something like geometrical progression, is almost 
enough to take one's breath away. In a pamphlet 
bearing the title, "University of Michigan Library, 
1905-1912. A Brief Review by the Librarian," a 
striking instance of rapid library growth is noted. 
"More books," writes Mr. Koch, "have been added 
to the University Library during the seven years of 
my librarianship than in the first sixty years of the 
history of the University. Or, to put it another way, 
if the present growth of the Library continues, it 
will, by December 1914, be double in size what it 
was when I came to the Library in 1904." With 
increase in size comes also a more than proportional 
increase in expense, because, for example, "it costs 
more to put a book into a large library than in[to] a 
small one, because more and higher grade labor is 
required to find whether the book is not already in 
or ordered for the library. It costs more to classify 
a book in a large library than in a small one ; more 
time and more skill are required to correctly place a 
new book in a collection where there are many books 
in the same field than where there is but a handful 
of books on the subject." And so with cataloguing 
and labelling and shelving; so also with keeping in 
good order and repair, and with meeting the appli- 
cant's demand for any specified book, the increased 
size of the collection necessarily causing more steps, 
more pages, perhaps a greater number of desk attend- 
ants. The small library, therefore, has certain reasons 
for thankfulness of which it is not always conscious, 
but to which it will perhaps have its eyes opened in 
that near future when it shall have become a large 
library. ... 

THE BOOK-SWINDLER IN THE TOILS of the govern- 
ment drag-net is a sight to rejoice gods and men. 
Twelve such swindlers of the ever-gullible newly- 
rich book-buyer have been indicted on the charge of 
unlawful use of the mails in advertising and selling 
so-called " de-luxe " editions that have in reality 



about the value of so much tinsel ; and the drag-net 
is still out. This praiseworthy action of the public 
authorities will perhaps serve, among other things, 
to make more than one owner of what he considers 
an extraordinarily valuable library open his eyes to 
the comparative worthlessness of the greater part of 
his collection. Better had it been for that man if 
he had spent in hiring the services of a competent 
librarian a quarter part of the wealth he has thrown 
away on showy bindings and cheap illustrations ; 
then the other three-quarters might have secured 
him a library really worth owning. The magnificent 
collection of Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan, for instance, 
splendidly housed and properly cared for, contains 
not a single example of the book-fakir's unholy art ; 
for his librarian, Miss Belle Greene, is reputed one 
of the most expert members of her profession, and 
has had a larger experience in the buying of literary 
rarities than anyone you will be likely to meet in a 
long day's journey. Nor is Mr. Morgan himself by 
any means a helpless innocent in the hands of the 
persuasive and plausible book swindler. It is safe 
to say that he knows almost as much, in a large and 
general way, about rare books as he does about 
railroads. ... 

THE PHILIPPINE LIBRARY has begun issuing a 
monthly "Bulletin," the first number containing a 
brief prospectus and a copy of the " Law Creating 
the Philippine Library," with a classified list of 
recent additions to the library. It was three and 
one-half years ago that all libraries belonging to the 
Insular Government were by legislative enactment 
consolidated into the "Philippines Library" under 
a managing board consisting of the secretaries of 
Public Instruction, the Interior, and Finance and 
Justice, with two other members appointed annually 
by the Governor-General. After many vicissitudes 
the library has secured good quarters in the old 
Army and Navy Club building, which will hence- 
forth be known as the Library building; and the 
entire collection of books under its control, but not 
all in this one building, numbers more than one hun- 
dred thousand volumes. It is to be noted, with 
some regret, that " a fee of five pesos per annum or 
fifty centavos per month is charged for the privilege 
of drawing books from the Circulating Division 
(American Circulating library)." The other priv- 
ileges of the library are free. Mr. James A. 
Robertson is librarian, Miss Syrena McKee chief 
cataloguer, Miss Bessie A. Dwyer chief of the circu- 
lating division, and Sefior Manuel Artigas y Cuerva 
curator of the " Filipiniana Division."

even worse than the unfortunate attempt of a recent

A NOTEWORTHY GIFT TO THE LIBRARY OF 

GRESS has placed it under great obligation to Mr. 
J. Pierpont Morgan. He has presented it with a 
volume containing what is the desire of all Ameri- 
can autograph-collectors and the despair of most of 
them, namely, a complete set of the "Signers." 
With an autograph letter preceding the signature in 
most instances, this collection of the fifty-six historic 
names affixed to the Declaration of Independence, 
each in the handwriting of the one to whom it 
belonged, is a treasure well worth preserving in the 
national library, which has hitherto, with shame be 
it confessed, been lacking in any such evidence of 
patriotic pride. It was probably because Mr. Mor- 
gan had learned this fact, with " chagrin and regret," 
as he says, that he took steps to supply the deficiency. 
The early damage to the Declaration itself, from 
unskilful handling in preparing a facsimile of the 
instrument, renders all the more important this pre- 
servation of a set of the signers' autographs on the 
government's part. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 



"EXTERNALISM" IN OUR COLLEGES. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

There are three good reasons why it is unnecessary 
for me to reply to the communication of " An American 
Professor" in your issue of December 1. His protest 
is against certain positions of your editorial rather than 
of my article (which I cannot be certain that he has 
read); the points of issue do not depend upon state- 
ments or views for which I am responsible, though I 
may in a measure agree with them; the points of issue 
lie somewhat apart from the central theme of my dis- 
cussion. Yet I cannot expect that those interested in 
the matter will take the pains to draw these distinctions. 
The " American Professor," whose lot seems to have 
fallen in pleasant places, sets forth that his own inter- 
ests and pursuits have not been seriously affected by 
the prevalent mode of university administration. To 
the casual reader this personal statement might give 
the erroneous impression that such an instance is ex- 
ceptional. It reminds one of a pre-election anecdote: 



the young daughter of the house, after listening to 
the political views of the guests at her father's table, 
remarked to the solitary member of the group: " I know 
some one else who is going to vote for Taft." My own 
statement of the " American Professor's " case is much 
stronger than his. I note: " Critically temperate state- 
ments admit the enormous power which he [the president] 
wields to mitigate or to aggravate the evils of the sys- 
tem." I have made it plain that there are many insti- 
tutions which suifer little fr,om these evils because of 
the spirit of their administration. There are doubtless 
hundreds of professors whose activities have not suf- 
fered from the system; and in the judgment of a great 
majority of the professors who answered Professor 
Cattell's inquiries, there are infinitely more whose 
careers have been unfortunately affected, and who are 
strongly opposed to the present form of government. 
My own opinion is thus expressed: "The successes 
achieved under the present system are in my judgment 
partly due to the compensations that lie in every sys- 
tem, however unsuitable, yet more largely to the miti- 
gations exercised under considerations foreign to its 
temper, more plainly to violations of its provisions, 
to concessions and forbearance." If the " American 
Professor " believes that the privileges which he en- 
joys would be endangered under the system of larger 
corporate control by the Faculties, his arguments upon 
which that belief is founded are entitled to consider- 
ation. I have made it plain that in all such discus- 
sions it is the average situation, not the best, that is 
to be considered; and it is the trend favored and 
the temptations offered (not the result of departure 
from that trend and the resistance of temptation) that 
must decide as to the worthiness of one or another 
form of government. " The unwise authority and false 
responsibility of the presidential office invites the in- 
cumbent to attempt impossible tasks; invites him to 
adopt irrelevant standards," etc. As to the actual 
situation, I prefer to accept the cumulative opinion 
which Professor Cattell has assembled; as similarly in 
my statements I cited the selected opinions of those 
who had given careful attention to the subject in an 
aspect broader than the personal one. This consensus 
of opinion goes far enough to be most gratifying. 
The scores of complimentary letters which I have 
received since my article appeared, I accept as expres- 
sions of agreement with the importance of the position 
which I set forth. 

The second issue relates to the undesirable effects 
upon the student body of some of the forces that main- 
tain the present system. In discussing this point, 
one of several and not central, but selected because 
of its popular interest, I took care to indicate that I 
was presenting the summary of the judgments of 
others and not my own. I cited some witnesses and 
reflected as best I could the general impression of a 
large number of papers which I had read. To indicate 
the bearing of these upon my argument, I said: "Let 
me concede at once that some of the above trends are 
within limits legitimate and helpful, and again that 
they are not wholly or predominantly due to the ad- 
ministrative influence." And again: "Doubtless the 
causes of the situation so variously complained of, like 
the cause of the high rate of living, are both deep 
and wide." The " American Professor " suggests that 
some institutions deserving to be placed on the blacklist 
be named, and that I should name them. I fail to see 
either the pertinence or the profit of the suggestion.

Such a body as the " Carnegie Foundation for the Ad- 
vancement of Teaching" might favorably undertake such 
an investigation and publish reports (as has been done 
in regard to Medical Schools) that would be helpful if 
received in the proper spirit, of which there is at 
present no guarantee. It may be that if the " American 
Professor " wrote to some of the more discerning stu- 
dents of tendencies in the American College, he would 
obtain the names of institutions in which one set or 
another of the deplored tendencies was particularly 
marked. Taking the description as a composite photo- 
graph so carefully blended that no individual features 
are unpleasantly present, I have no difficulty in recog- 
nizing the appropriateness of the whole to many an insti- 
tution, though it is not a portrait of anyone. Nor have 
I any intention of adding to the woes of an educational 
reformer by suggesting even in confidence which one of 
the sitters for the composite the portrait most favors. 
If the " American Professor " will without prejudice 
write the names of a score of American colleges on slips 
of paper, and draw a few of these at random (unless 
Minerva in disapproval of the method protects the issue), 
he will know the names of a few of the institutions to 
which some of the criticisms moderately apply. Even 
as I write, my attention is arrested by this wholly in- 
cidental sentence in an address by President Jordan 
(" Science," December 6) : " It [the private institution] 
is above all temptation to grant university titles or 
degrees to the products of four years of frivolity, dis- 
sipation and sham." Such sentences by their very 
casual nature indicate how widespread this charge has 
become. 

I regret that issues of this type require such large 
draughts upon personal judgment; but this is inevitable. 
It is not necessary that they should be rendered yet 
more uncertain by the undue emphasis of individual 
experience. JOSEPH J ASTRO w.

THE PARALYSIS OF CULTURE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

After reading your leading editorial of November 16, 
on " Our Spiritual Health,"and also Dr. Andre ws's article 
in the " International Journal of Ethics " on which your 
editorial is based, may one reader at least testify to the 
faith that is still in him? That faith is very much shaken 
upon occasion by contact with certain people; but those 
people are neither the readers of Nietzsche nor the 
Socialists, neither of whom Dr. Andrews gives any sign 
that he understands even in the most external and remote 
way. In the first place the doctrine of naturalism is 
practically dead, and Nietzsche heralded as the expon- 
ent of its " logical outcome " by Dr. Andrews had a 
good deal to do with destroying it. As against the 
" prudential regulation " theory of morals which Dr. 
Andrews mentions the utilitarian moral sanctions, that 
is to say, Nietzsche thundered valiantly. After read- 
ing the English utilitarians, he impatiently exclaims: 
"Man does not seek after happiness; only an English- 
man seeks after his happiness. I seek not after my 
happiness, I seek after my work." 

And as for Socialism, is it not, in spite of its unfortu- 
nate but non-essential and obsolescent system of dogma, 
one of the cultural agencies of the present day ? Is it 
not, indeed, the largest movement against that very spirit 
which your commentator says " can contemplate the 
social and political issues of our time . . . with hardly 
any other emotion than curiosity "? The spirit of personal 



culture is strong within the Socialist party ranks. 
Among the men and women there assembled you may 
not find interest in the particular classical authors who 
bound "culture" for Dr. Andrews, but you may find 
interest in contemporary art, literature, and philosophy, 
both European and American ; and often, too, an appre- 
ciative valuing of the human side of Greek literature. 

In reality the sinners against whom Dr. Andrews 
should thunder are neither the materialists (if there are 
any of them left to bow before his wrath) , nor the Social- 
ists, both of whom are obviously seeking " culture " and 
who are obviously not "indifferentists" for if they were, 
how did they arrive at their present unpopular and 
thought-requiring positions ? No, the people against 
whom Dr. Andrews's fulminations should have been 
directed are the smug dwellers in his own camp the 
" cultured " people and the " religious " people. Not 
the Socialists, but the orthodox churches to-day are 
afraid of this attitude which we are now discussing under 
the hackneyed term of culture. Let any reader attend 
first a Christian Endeavor meeting or any social gather- 
ing of church folk, and then go to a club meeting in any 
social settlement or to any Socialist assembly, and he 
will at once detect the difference of intellectual temper 
between the two groups. 

And the nominally "cultured" people simply justify 
the use of the foregoing qualification when they tell us 
that their culture is incompatible with the life of the time 
even when that life is expressed, perhaps crudely, in 
Socialism. As against such an idea, true culture says 
and the saying shall here be through the voice of Pro- 
fessor J. W. Mackail of Oxford that the " socialist " 
motive must dominate the art and poetry of the future. 
In the Introduction to his " Lectures on Poetry " Mr. 
Mackail says : "But in the fully socialized common- 
wealth which, as a dream or vision, mankind begins to 
have before their eyes, there may be a future for poetry, 
larger, richer, more triumphant, than its greatest achieve- 
ments in the past have reached. Poetry will become 
the nobler interpretation of an ampler life. That vision 
is in the future. But to some at least, here and now, 
it is a vision and no dream." 

Unless culture means vision, unless it means a sure 
prophylaxis against the attitude of scolding, while the 
scolder's eyes are closed, then it is not the genuine 
attitude but a mere pedantic pose.

COOPERATION IN BUSINESS AND 
AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In the issue of THE DIAL of November 16, 1 read 
with interest Mr. Josephson's communication regarding 
a proposed institute of business and agricultural re- 
search. You are probably familiar with Wilhelm 
Ostwald's similar plan launched about two years ago, 
known as " Die Briicke," having, however, a much wider 
scope. Does Mr. Josephson contemplate any coopera- 
tion with " Die Brucke " ? If not, why not ? 

MAX BATT.

and international, not mentioned in my letter.

WILLIAM VAUGHN MOODY.* 

The two handsome volumes in which the com- 
plete creative work of William Vaughn Moody 
has just been published in definitive form de- 
serve a heartier welcome than any other publi- 
cation of the year. One of them contains the 
two prose plays, " The Great Divide " and " The 
Faith Healer "; the other contains the trilogy 
" The Fire-Bringer," " The Masque of Judg- 
ment," and a fragment of " The Death of Eve " 
the "Poems" hitherto published, a consider- 
able number of later pieces which now for the 
first time see the light, and a beautifully written 
memoir of the poet, written by his friend, Pro- 
fessor John M. Manly. Each volume has a 
portrait frontispiece. We have spoken of these 
volumes as containing all of Moody 's creative 
work, but this statement requires qualification. 
Everything that Moody wrote had the creative 
quality, and for a full understanding of his 
genius one must not neglect to take into account 
his scattered writings in prose, chief among 
them being the introductions to his editions of 
Milton and of " The Pilgrim's Progress," and 
the school "History of English Literature" 
which he wrote in collaboration with Professor 
Lovett. It is pleasant to be informed that 
another avenue of access to his personality will 
presently be opened by the publication of a 
selection from his correspondence. 

Nevertheless, the main thing to be empha- 
sized about Moody is that he was a poet by the 
grace of God, and such a poet as had not been 
raised up before him in America or even in 
the English-speaking world since the eclipse 
of the great line of the older singers. The first 
decade of the twentieth century was the period 
during which his powers came to fruition, and 
within which practically all of his work was 
done. He seems, then, to be the one authentic 
" maker " that our young century has given to 
the world, achieving a height that none of his 
contemporary fellows-craftsmen in the poetic 
art, either in England or America, could attain. 
This being the case, it is upon the poems that 
our attention should be mainly fixed, for the 
two prose plays, fine as they are, seem almost 
negligible in the comparison. They show their 
author as a subtle revealer of human nature and 
as an expert in psychological dramaturgy, but

they give slight evidence of his deeper inspira- 
tion or of the magnificence of his lyrical gift. 

Those who seek to discover in the circum- 
stances of his nurture and environment the secret 
of his power will be completely baffled. Born 
in 1869 in Indiana the commonwealth which 
has been styled, perhaps somewhat unkindly, 
the Boeotia of America 'he was one of the seven 
children of a steamboat captain. There were 
English, French, and German strains in his 
blood, happily blended, as the event proved. 
He worked for his education, putting himself 
through school, academy, and college by means 
of teaching. He took a master's degree at Har- 
vard, and a year later joined the staff of the 
University of Chicago, where he taught English 
for seven years. There is nothing in all this 
which might not be paralleled in the life-histories 
of thousands of other boys ; if we are to look at 
all for external influences in the shaping of his 
genius, we shall find them rather in the friends 
with whom he chiefly had intercourse, and in the 
scenes to which he was led by the Wanderlust. 
Walking in the Black Forest, bicycling over the 
Italian mountains, climbing the Dolomites, rid- 
ing through the Peloponnesus, " roughing it " in 
the Colorado mountains and the Arizona desert, 
visiting the countries of the Spaniard and the 
Moor these were the recreations of such ad- 
venturous days as were vouchsafed him during 
the years in which his was the common lot of 
working for a living. He once wrote: "I started 
in to-day on another quarter's work at the shop 
with vacation and restored consciousness three 
months away." This attitude toward the ap- 
pointed daily task when that task is the noble 
one of teaching does not, as a rule, deserve 
approval. But we can hardly blame a man like 
Moody for assuming it, knowing, as we do, his 
power to become a teacher in a still finer and 
broader sense, and realizing how such a spirit 
as his must chafe under any form of routine. 
The " restored consciousness " which vacation 
gave him was a consciousness of the release of 
faculty which meant for him no hours of idle- 
ness, but rather a resumption of sovereignty by 
the creative impulse, urging to days of the most 
strenuous spiritual endeavor. 

The stupendous task which Moody set himself 
in the trilogy is the highest which poetry has 
ever attempted. It is the task of 2Eschylus and 
Dante and Milton, the task of Goethe in his 
"Faust" and of Shelley in his "Prometheus 
Unbound." It is Milton's attempt to "justify 
the ways of God to man " coupled with the at- 
tempt of the later poets to justify the ways of

man to God. It was the Great Synthesis, under- 
taken by the emancipated modern spirit, the 
fusing of God and his world into a monistic 
scheme. "This thought," says Mr. Manly, "is 
set forth in the first member, ' The Fire-Bringer,' 
through the reaction on the human race of the 
effort of Prometheus to make man independent 
of God ; in the second member, ' The Masque of 
Judgment,' through a declaration of the conse- 
quences to God himself that would inevitably 
follow his decree for the destruction of mankind ; 
in the third member, 'The Death of Eve,' it was 
intended to set forth the impossibility of separa- 
tion, the complete unity of the Creator and his 
Creation." What has been lost to the world 
through the tragic fact of the poet's death before 
he had put the last window in his Aladdin's palace 
may be but faintly surmised. Some hints of his 
intention were given to his intimates, enabling 
Mr. Manly to prepare a statement from which 
we quote. Eve, having survived ages of years, 
" has undergone a new spiritual awakening, and 
with clearing vision sees that her sin need not 
have been the final, fatal thing it seemed ; that 
God's creatures live by and within his being 
and cannot be estranged or divided from him. 
Seeing this dimly, she is under the compulsion 
of a great need to return to the place where her 
defiant thought had originated, and there declare 
her new vision of life. ... In the third act 
there was to be a song by Eve, the burden of 
which would be the inseparableness of God and 
man, during which, as she rises to a clearer and 
gentler view of the spiritual life, she gently 
passes from the vision of her beholders." These 
suggestions are precious enough, but they only 
make more poignant our sense of loss. We 
confess that we would rather have had the poem 
completed than " the story of Cambuscan bold," 
or the tragedy of the Greek Gotterdammerung 
which was left half -told in the "Hyperion" of 
Keats. 

Moody's mastery of his material was such as 
only the greatest artists can exhibit. In the 
trilogy, he shows himself to be equally familiar 
with the Greek, Hebraic, and Christian myths, 
to have seized upon their inner significance, and 
to have saturated his soul with their beauty. 
And when it comes to that supreme test of the 
poet, the dramatic lyric, what music is at his 
command ! Listen to the Song of the Redeemed 
Spirits : 

" In the wilds of life astray, 

Held far from our delight, 

Following the cloud by day 

And the fire by night, 

Came we a desert way. 



O Lord, with apples feed us, 

With flagons stay ! 

By Thy still waters lead us ! " 

There is no conceivable process of human 
thought, susceptible of analysis and exposition, 
which could produce such a song as this. The 
inspiration of genius will alone account for it, 
as for the lyrics of Shelley, none of which is 
more beautiful. And the same thing may be 
said of the Songs of Pandora : 

" Along the earth and up the sky 
The Fowler spreads his net," 
and 

" Of wounds and sore defeat 

I made my battle stay," 
and 

" Because one creature of his breath 
Sang loud into the face of death," 

and, most wonderful of all, 

" I stood within the heart of God; 
It seemed a place that I had known." 

Lyric utterance in English has never achieved 
higher and purer strains than these. We may 
say of them, as Symonds says of the lyrics in 
" Prometheus Unbound," that they " may be 
reckoned the touch-stone of a man's capacity 
for understanding lyric poetry. The world in 
which the action is supposed to move, rings with 
spirit voices ; and what these spirits sing, is 
melody more purged of mortal dross than any 
other poet's ear has caught, while listening to 
his own heart's song, or to the rhythms of the 
world." And added to the wonder of it all is 
the fact that these songs sprang from the heart 
of one who was with us in the flesh but yester- 
day, whose eyes and voice and hand-clasp we 
remember. Half a century hence, it may be 
matter of boastful pride with young poets to 
have spoken with one of the college students 
who in their own youth saw Moody plain. 

Nothing could be more superficial, or give 
more convincing evidence of spiritual blindness 
than the complaint that has been made against 
Moody for his choice of major themes, speaking 
of him as of one standing apart from life be- 
cause he envisaged it through the medium of 
Greek and Christian myths. As Mr. Manly 
justly says : " Moody's ideas, though familiar 
and indeed in many cases ancient themes of 
art, are made new and vital by subjection to his 
temperament and culture and by association 
with the elements of his spiritual life. In later 
years his main themes were social and economic 
injustice, patriotism, the heart of woman, and 
the relations of God and the soul, the meaning 
of human life. To the reconception of all these 
larger issues, he brought the richest intellectual

and emotional endowment possessed by any 
American* poet." The incredulous may retort 
to this last assertion, 

" Du sprichst ein grosses Wort gelassen aus," 
but we believe that time will justify it, and, 
having once lache le mot in the quotation from 
Mr. Manly, we hasten to give it our assent. 
Returning to the original argument, it may be 
said that even were we lacking all the pieces 
which are concerned with strictly modern 
themes, we should still find the modern note 
dominant in the trilogy, for all its ancient 
framework. As well say that Goethe's " Faust," 
because of its mediaeval subject-matter, had no 
significance for the modern world, as say that 
Moody's treatment of the Prometheus story was 
a mere exercise in outworn modes of expression. 
Rather than that, it throbs in every line with 
the heart-beats of twentieth century thought 
and feeling, and, so far from harking back to 
the past, ever opens vistas of the future to our 
gaze. 

The reasons which persuade us that Moody 
has a place among the great poets may be briefly 
summarized. In the first place, he deals with 
the supreme issues of life and thought, with the 
destiny of man, and his deepest delvings into 
the mystery of the universe. He has the cul- 
tural equipment needed for such a task, and he 
transfuses its elements in the crucible of his 
genius until they emerge in new spiritual com- 
binations. His vision is his own, fresh and vivid, 
and his emotion has unfathomed depths. He 
takes old themes and images, and " mingles 
them with unaccustomed but predestined asso- 
ciations." Coupled with his vision is a rich and 
fervid imagination which seems inexhaustible in 
its command of metaphor, and which invests his 
thought with new creative shapes. A beautiful 
illustration of this is taken from the great Ode, 
where he speaks of the common grave of Robert 
Shaw and his negro soldiers. 
" Now limb doth mingle with dissolved limb 

In nature's busy old democracy, 

To flush the mountain laurel when she blows 

Sweet by the southern sea, 

And heart with crumbled heart climbs in the rose." 

One would have thought this old conceit was 
done with by the poets, yet Moody has enshrined 
it in a form that owes nothing to his predeces- 
sors, and that gives it a new significance. He 
was preeminently a sane poet and a sincere one, 
without a touch of morbidity or preciosity. He 
loved words for their beauty, and had an almost 
unexampled power to pack rich meanings into 
a single epithet. " What names the stars have ! " 



he once said to us when Antares was mentioned. 
A word was to him like a jewel, reflecting mani- 
fold hues from its facets, or like the note of a 
violin, with its gamut of attendant overtures, 
which he made us overhear. And with all this 
endowment he had the ear for music without 
which no great poetry is possible. Equally in 
his lovely lyrical measures, his free dithyrambic 
passages, and his stately blank verse, he had the 
sure sense of beauty that was the gift of the 
Greeks, and of Milton, and of Shelley. We 
think of Poe and Lanier as our American met- 
rists, and it is probably an understatement to 
say that Moody was their peer. Now that he is 
made one with nature, now that our grief for the 
sufferings of his last tortured days has become 
softened by the ministry of time, we may take 
comfort from the thought that no poet could, 
with firmer assurance, face death with the 
"Benediction" of Baudelaire upon his lips: 
" Soyez be'ni, mon Dieu, qui donnez la souffrance 
Comme un divin remede a nos impurete's, 
Et comme la meilleure et la plus pure essence 
Qui prepare les forts aux saintes volupte's ! 

" Je sais que vous gardez une place au Poe'te 
Dans les rangs bienheureux des saintes Le'gions, 
Et que vous 1'invitez a 1'e'ternelle fete 
Des Trones, des Vertus, des Dominations." 

Who, if not the poet of " The Masque of Judg- 
ment," to whom Thrones, Virtues, and Domina- 
tions were familiars, could with clearer title look 
forward to participation in God's everlasting 
festival? WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE. 



THE LAST DAYS OF THE CONFEDERACY.* 



The most original feature of General Schaff 's 
" The Battle of the Wilderness," the thing that 
signally caught the attention of readers, was its 
application of epic methods to historic narrative. 
In the spiritual framework, the supernatural 
machinery of that book, the author might almost 
be credited with the creation of a new form in 
literature. Probably to a good many sincere 
minds this form was a stumbling-block. A dis- 
tinguished fellow-soldier said to him, " When 
you get done with your poetry and get down to 
history you will write a valuable book." But 
he did write a valuable book, an unique book, 
one aglow with vision and emotion. Its peculiar 
characteristics, its creative artistry, are what 
make it stand out from the hundreds of nar- 
ratives and records of the Civil War, though

THE DIAL 



487 



many of these are also told by eye-witnesses and 
infused with personal emotion. 

In essaying again a study of a single phase 
of the Civil War, General Schaff had two 
courses open to him. He might either bring 
back his new-made myths, his figures of fancy 
that brood above the scene and intermingle with 
the actors, or he might trust to plain narrative 
and the dignity of his theme. Very wisely, we 
think, he has chosen the latter method, except 
for a few brief and unimportant touches of the 
old imagination. It is very doubtful whether he 
could have captured again the thrilling effect of 
his first creations. A warmed-up mythology of 
visions and apparitions would have been fatal. 

Another thing missing in the new book is the 
story of personal adventure, which, threading 
the great, glittering, and gloomy scenes of march 
and battlefield, made them at once more con vine- 
ing and lent to them an air of romance and gay 
high spirits. We must count this a loss ; though 
in wholly suppressing himself in the presence of 
the last great struggle, the author has obeyed 
the dictates of the finest good taste. Everything 
else that was apparent in the earlier book is 
here : the vivid phrase ; the easy prose, pulsing 
as with the systole and diastole of the heart; 
the nature-painting, insistent and persistent. 
Probably no historian has ever set his scene with 
greater definition of view, more elaboration of 
foliage and flowers. The bills, roads, streams, 
houses are as real and vivid as the hosts which 
struggle and fight among them. 

As far as theme is concerned the advantage is 
all with General Schaff 's latest book. The battle 
of the Wilderness, that confused and indecisive 
struggle, that almost undecipherable scroll of 
events unrolled under the glooms of the tangled 
scrub-oak forest, has neither the unity nor the 
importance of the final, fatal week of the Con- 
federacy. Each book covers only the operations 
of a few days, but in "The Sunset of the Con- 
federacy" all the elements of great tragedy 
appear clear and distinct. 

The book opens with a scene out of a novel, 
Jefferson Davis and other dignitaries of the 
South at devotion in St. Paul's Church in Rich- 
mond, and the pompous sexton marching up 
and down the aisle to call each one of them sepa- 
rately out. The lines at Petersburg have been 
broken, and the end is near. Then follows the 
panic in the city, the departure of the trains 
with government officials, the withdrawal of the 
troops. Lee's seven days' retreat which ensues 
is told with amazing minuteness and clearness. 
It is not too much to say that the narrative re- 



calls the art in De Quincey's " Flight of a Tartar 
Tribe" or Tolstoi's description of the rout of 
Bagration and his Russians in " War and Peace." 
General Schaff's impulsive prose, which curvets 
and prances and paws the ground like a high- 
strung horse, makes good speed and hurries us 
from side to side of the widespread flight, takes 
us into Lee's rushing hampered columns and 
into Grant's relentless cohorts of pursuit. The 
objectivity, the open-air quality of the style is 
noticeable, and not less so its waywardness and 
off-handedness. General Schaff will interrupt a 
cavalry charge to get down and paint some field 
flowers or brookside blooming bushes. Yet the 
whole thing is alive and rushing on. 

Let us give a few specimens of the fresh and 
vivid writing of the book and first, of its 
nature painting: 

" I wish we could find a good, overlooking spot. 
How will that little elevation down there in the valley 
answer; that rises like an old-fashioned beehive on the 
left of the road and has a brotherhood of four or rive 
big-limbed oaks crowning it, one of them leaning some- 
what? Admirably! . . . Well, here we are: oaks spread- 
ing above us, at our feet violets, liverwort, and spring 
beauties scattered among acorn hulls, dead leaves, and 
clustered grass. What a reviewing stand, and so near 
the road that we shall be able to distinguish faces ! " 

Here is a night piece : 

" Yet, reader, for loneliness and every aide who like 
myself has carried dispatches will bear witness to the 
truth of what I say give me a park of army-wagons 
in some wan old field wrapt in darkness at the dead 
hours of a moonless night, men and mules asleep, camp- 
fires breathing their last, and the beams of day, which 
wander in the night, resting ghost-like on the arched 
and mildewed canvas covers." 

And here is a battle picture: 

" They were now advancing firmly with colors, and 
there were so many standards crimsoning each body of 
troops to their glory the Confederate color-bearers 
stood by Lee to the last, that they looked like march- 
ing gardens blooming with cockscomb, red roses, and 
poppies. . . . The road was packed with men, their faces 
grimly ablaze, colors flying, and over them, like a waver- 
ing shield of steel, were their muskets at right-shoulder- 
shift, as they trotted forward to the sound of the now 
booming guns ; for Gordon's and Fitz Lee's veterans were 
answering the last call of the Confederacy with their old- 
time spirit." 

Perhaps what most of all imparts vitality to 
General Schaff's work is the immense gallery of 
human pictures painted from the intimacy of 
comradeship or experience. Some of these are 
full-length portraits, some mere heads, some 
thumbnail sketches dashed in with a phrase. 
And there is no West Point exclusiveness in 
this commemorative work. The author is just 
as ready to devote a paragraph or a page to 
some unnamed soldier boy as to the proudest

general. Witness, for instance, the young sen- 
tinel in gray who turns back the slave dealer 
from the escaping Richmond train, or the young 
lad with brimming eyes who attracts Major 
Stiles's attention at field service and who next 
day is shot dead. Naturally, however, most of 
the portraits are of men of known name. Here 
is Ouster : 

" After his promotion to a generalcy, Custer dressed 
fantastically in olive corduroy, wore his yellow hair long, 
and supported a flaming scarlet flannel necktie whose 
loose ends the wind fluttered across his breast as, with 
uplifted sabre, he charged at the head of his brigade, 
followed by his equally reckless troopers, who, in loving 
imitation, wore neckties like his own." 

And here is Sheridan : 

" Sheridan is mounted on Rienzi. Look at man and 
horse, for they are both of the same spirit and temper. 
It was Rienzi who with flaming nostrils carried Sheridan 
to the field of Cedar Creek, 'twenty miles away'; and 
on the field of Five Forks, the battle which broke Lee's 
line and let disaster in. Before the final charge there, 
the horse became as impatient as its rider, kicking, 
plunging, tossing his head, pulling at the bit, while foam 
flecked his black breast. Sheridan gave him his head, 
when he saw that Ayres, at the point of the bayonet, 
was going to carry the day; off sprang Rienzi and with 
a leap bounded over the enemy's works and landed 
Sheridan among the mob of prisoners and fighting 
troops " 

General Schaff apologizes for not giving much 
attention to the greater Union leaders, as he had 
dealt pretty fully with them in his previous 
book. Grant and Meade, indeed, are kept rather 
in the background, save toward the close when 
the former of course takes the centre of the stage. 
But Lee is painted minutely and lovingly, on 
the march, at camp-fire, at council. Lee is the 
hero of the book. Shall we wonder at this ? Is 
it strange that a Union officer, proud of his army 
and its leaders, should at the moment of victory 
draw back, give precedence to a defeated foe, 
and offer the crown of glory to Lee and his 
devoted veterans ? No ! It was their time of 
tragedy and triumph. Except Napoleon's last 
campaign before Waterloo, Lee's last year of 
struggle against the North is the most wonder- 
ful thing in modern warfare. General Schaff's 
final tribute to Lee is too long to quote, but 
here are its concluding lines : 

" No, no eagle that ever flew, no tiger that ever sprang, 
had more natural courage; and I will guarantee that 
every field he was on, if you ask them about him, will 
speak of the unquailing battle-spirit of his mien. Be 
not deceived: Lee, notwithstanding his poise, was nat- 
urally the most belligerent bull-dog man at the head of 
any army in the war." 

Grave and tender and true is the North ; gay 
and ardent and courteous is the South ! But we 
think that for once the South is beaten out of 



the field in its own qualities. We doubt whether 
there is any Southern book more chivalrous in 
generosity of judgment about Southern leaders 
than is this; or a more emotional seizure of 
the passion, pathos, and heroism of the last days 
of the Lost Cause. -

A POET ix LANDSCAPE.* 



This study of the art of Homer Martin by Mr. 
F. J. Mather, Jr., is of the same form as that on 
the art of George Inness by Mr. Daingerfield, 
which was reviewed in THE DIAL some time 
since. It is a handsome little quarto, beautifully 
printed, and illustrated with a frontispiece in 
color and a dozen other reproductions. It is to 
be hoped that these two volumes are only the 
beginning of a series of monographs upon Ameri- 
can Landscape Painters, and that they will be 
speedily followed by volumes on Cole, Durand, 
and Church, and others after as well as before 
Homer Martin. It will be difficult to find au- 
thors as competent as Mr. Mather, who has an 
intimate knowledge of his subject as well as 
wide artistic reading and long practice in criti- 
cism. One addition may be suggested to such 
volumes : they certainly ought to have a list of 
the paintings of the painter they discuss, and, 
one would think, also a bibliography. They are 
necessarily expensive books, but their price is 
doubtless none too much when the typography 
and execution are considered, as well as the mar- 
ket. As the publisher seems to have done every- 
thing that could be asked of him, one would say 
that the author should do so too. If these books 
are to be merely attractive tokens of regard to 
be passed around among friends or to lie on club 
tables they will, of course, need only typography, 
pictures, and criticism. If, however, they are 
really to take the place of authoritative mono- 
graphs, they ought to appeal to the student as 
well as to the amateur. And the student, 
although perhaps not entitled to a bibliography, 
would seem to be entitled to a list of works. 
Mr. Mather, of course, has material for a list of 
Homer Martin's work that ought to be more com- 
plete than anyone else possesses ; it must be the 
basis of his work. And if that work is to receive 
the intelligent criticism which alone will give it 
the place it ought to take, others ought to have 
advantage, at least, of his knowledge of where 
the materials for study are to be found. In

this way a foundation would be laid for a real 
knowledge of the subject, which would finally 
be of ultimate use to the student of American 
art. Mr. Mather's criticism has great and dis- 
tinguished value ; but if it is to remain a real 
contribution to the history of American painting, 
if it is to maintain itself above the ordinary dilet- 
tante club-talk, it should be reviewed by people 
who have studied the same materials that he has. 

Not having the advantage of any such knowl- 
edge of Homer Martin's work as Mr. Mather, 
and relying on the other hand only on such gen- 
eral information as to American landscape paint- 
ing as is open to hundreds of others, I can offer 
but a desultory and slightly founded criticism 
of the estimate of Homer Martin here offered. 
If my views appear to be based upon an insuffi- 
cient knowledge it will be largely due, I believe, 
to the very lack of opportunity for thorough 
critical study given not only by this monograph 
but by most works dealing with the general 
subject. 

And first as to Martin's general position. 
Mr. Mather says that " Martin frankly accepted 
the traditional scenic ideal of landscape paint- 
ing and always remained faithful to it " (p. 15) ; 
that he was " the last and greatest expression " 
of the movement which he himself is said to have 
called the Hudson River School (p. 16); that 
"he actually realised what had been merely the 
ambition of Durand and Cole" (p. 15). I be- 
lieve that this is very true as far as it goes, but 
it does not appear to me to go far enough to be 
really definitive. What was the Hudson River 
School ? What was " the ambition of Durand 
and Cole " ? One would gather from the lan- 
guage that they had the same ambition. That, 
however, was not the case ; they had very differ- 
ent ambitions, and their paintings, which look 
wholly different even to the haphazard amateur, 
were the expression of very different ideas. Now 
Homer Martin, to judge from Mr. Mather's 
whole treatment, did not have the ideals of either 
Cole or Durand, nor was his accomplishment 
like that of either. The painter who realized 
what had been merely the ambitions of Cole and 
Durand was Frederick E. Church : he had the 
grandiose romanticism of Cole and the affec- 
tionate naturalism of Durand. Martin would 
seem to me to have had neither. It may be that 
I misinterpret Mr. Mather when he speaks of 
the ambition of Durand and Cole, or of the tra- 
ditional scenic ideal of landscape painting. He 
may mean merely the ambition really to present 
the wonderful and characteristic notes of Amer- 
ican scenery, those things wherein America was 



different from the rest of the world, those things 
which might make, or even necessitate, an 
" American School '' of landscape. Those things 
were, in the mind of Thomas Cole, a glorious 
liberty and power, wild and often fierce, as ex- 
pressed in mountain and lake, crag and forest ; 
and such things he loved to paint with romantic 
largeness. In the art of Durand the dominant 
idea seems to have been the sufficing energy and 
strength which created the mountains and forests 
alike, and hence with him the idea of truth and 
detail was most important. Homer Martin did 
not have either of these ideas. Yet as you look 
at his u Lake Sanford " or " The Sand Dunes, 
Lake Ontario," you feel as though he had some- 
thing which superseded both and was naturally 
finer than either. But just what this " some- 
thing" was I do not find in Mr. Mather's esti- 
mate, and miss it. Mr. Mather shows that 
Martin had the ability to render the grandeur 
of form and wide space that seemed to him the 
dominant factors in the American scene, and to 
render it in the painter's style ; but I do not 
find that he has anywhere made a sufficient and 
convincing statement of the matter. The gen- 
eral estimate, however, whether fully stated or 
not, is a real contribution : it shows critical 
insight as well as sufficient knowledge ; it is 
just the kind of thing we need. 

The second point that I would speak of is the 
question why Martin was not popular in his 
later days. He was obviously not, and indeed 
could hardly sell his later pictures for any sum 
however small. I note the matter because it 
seems, very characteristic, and indeed explana- 
atory of Martin's whole life. Mr. Mather 
makes the fact clear, but says that he will 
merely note it without comment. His subject, 
he says (p. 63), is "a particular artist and not 
the various pseudo-esthetic forms of human 
vanity." That, of course, is the case, and yet 
I believe we should have a better idea of what 
Martin's art really was, if we had a definite 
statement of why it differed from the art in favor 
in the later years of the nineteenth century. It 
was not till after Martin's death that his pic- 
tures commanded any sort of price, and then 
they became so valuable that they were fabri- 
cated for the trade. Now it seems to me very 
clear why a public which in 18^0, say, admired 
Monet and Pissarro. and would certainly buy 
pictures like those of Twachtman (not to men- 
tion other men still living), would not buy the 
pictures of Homer Martin, and I should say that 
a statement of the fact would make very clear 
just what Homer Martin really was.

THE DIAL, 



[ Dec. 16, 



1 should range the leading figures in Amer- 
ican landscape somewhat in this way: first 
(after the very beginners) Thomas Cole, who 
expressed the predominating romanticism of his 
time, which soared aloft like a rocket and 
blazed out into darkness in the work of Moran, 
Bierstadt, and Church ; second Durand, who 
represented a sort of pre-Raphaelitism which 
though very pervasive never produced any 
painter greater than Durand himself; then 
George Inness, who represents the influence of 
the Barbizon group and is the greatest man 
in America produced by that influence; then 
somebody still living (one needn't say who) 
who will stand for Impressionism ; and finally 
the painters of our own day. Now among 
these influences and periods, the place of Homer 
Martin, as I understand him and his work, is 
that he continues the ideas of Cole and Durand, 
in the sense already stated, in the time of George 
Inness. It appears to me very natural that he 
was never popular, nor even very interesting. 

Not interesting, except, of course, to those 
who love beautiful painting without regard to 
periods or influences or theories or fashions, who 
can be thrilled by noble emotion even when con- 
veyed by unfashionable technique, and by fine 
technique even when it has no passion but that 
of the workman. I love the pictures of Cole; 
the painting of his time was awful, but I like 
his grandiose romanticism. I love equally the 
pictures of Inness, though I cannot say I have 
much sympathy with his views on the poetry 
of nature. But there are also a number of 
painters among our American landscapists who 
seem chiefly to be painters, without much refer- 
ence to other people or to any ideas other than 
their own. Such I take to be Thomas Doughty 
in our early history, a man who seems to have 
been quite unable to accommodate himself to 
the rising passion of his time for crags and 
cataracts, lakes and mountains. So he painted 
persistently glimpses of the Hudson and views 
of Fairmount Park, for which people cared little 
in his day and would care little now were it not 
in recognition of his fine artistic spirit. Some- 
thing of this sort is Homer Martin, as Mr. 
Mather presents him to us, a man in love 
with the greatness of nature at a time when 
people were charmed with her littlenesses, a man 
who would paint a mountain-top or an inland sea 
at a period when people in tune with their time 
were absorbed in the poetry of the door-yard, 
of the pair of bars, of the haystack. Other men 
with ideas like his own could maintain them- 
selves by the adventitious aid of tropic splendor 



or exotic associations. But Martin appealed to 
nothing adventitious, to nothing that was not 
of the essence of art. He had the sentiment 
of grandeur, and he was bent on rendering it 
grandly. He could not possibly have adopted 
the combination of the grand ideas of Cole and 
the nice minutiae of Durand that Church and 
Bierstadt showed was possible. He came fifty 
years after Cole and Durand, and he knew a bet- 
ter way of painting than either of them. So he 
pleased neither the multitude with his fine execu- 
tion nor the virtuosi with his noble imagination. 
What a pleasure to find someone to write and 
someone to publish a monograph upon an Amer- 
ican landscape painter ! It is much to be hoped 
that people will be found to buy and read ; but, 
after all, the writing and publishing are the 
main thing. I am sure it is as well worth doing 
as a monograph upon some obscure Italian of 
the fourteenth century or some Frenchman of the 
eighteenth. It is certainly much more difficult. 
With the old-time obscurity you have quite a 
limited set of facts to work with : different 
critics will arrange them in different ways, but 
there are not enough for more than a conjectural 
estimate at best. With a man of our own, or 
almost of our own, time, the flood of facts is over- 
whelming, and the labor certainly is astonishing 
if the result does not seem very splendid. Would 
that students of literature would give to Amer- 
ican work the toil and the care which they con- 
secrate to often inferior workers of remote time 
and place. With the tried and tested means of 
modern criticism what may not be found in the 
history of art in America, by those who are as 
capable and as willing as Mr. Mather?

Since Paul Sabatier published his Vie de S.

thirty French editions of the work, an excellent 
English translation, and several other foreign 
translations. Thus the wonder-story of the great

pointed out how warped and misleading much 
of Sabatier's interpretation is, especially his 
emphasis on the personality of Saint Francis in 
conflict with the Church of his time and with the 
tendencies towards corporate growth on the part 
of his order. The appearance in English, there- 
fore, of two thoroughly orthodox biographies of 
Saint Francis, of popular character, will be wel- 
comed by Catholic scholars, while the general 
reading public will have a chance to make the 
acquaintance of the saint through these new 
books. The first of these is an English trans- 
lation, by Dr. T. O'Conor Sloane, of the Danish 
scholar Jorgensen's "Saint Francis of Assisi," 
a detailed and scholarly biography; while the 
second is a much more popular work entitled 
"Everybody's Saint Francis," by the well- known 
American Roman Catholic writer, Dr. Mau- 
rice F. Egan. Jorgensen's book has five excel- 
lent photogravure illustrations from thirteenth 
and fourteenth century portraits and manu- 
scripts ; while Dr. Egan's simpler chapters are 
adorned by twenty full-page drawings (eight of 
them in color) by the famous French artist, 
M. Boutet de Monvel. 

In dealing with the life of Saint Francis, the 
Danish scholar adopts a reverential attitude 
towards the sources, and gives a careful narra- 
tive account of all that is told on good author- 
ity concerning his subject. He does not indulge 
in critical discussions or excursions, but states 
his facts simply and briefly. The visions, 
miracles, and stigmata are either accepted as 
true or passed over as legends, and we have the 
story of the saint as known and believed in by 
his best informed contemporaries and followers. 
The biography is some what symmetrically organ- 
ized into four books, dealing respectively with 
Francis as Church Builder, Evangelist, God's 
Singer, and Hermit ; with an interesting appen- 
dix, originally the introduction to the Danish 
edition, on the authorities for the life of the 
saint. Although the original Danish work ap- 
peared in 1906, no attempt has been made to 
bring this appendix up to date; and its bibli- 
ographical value, while considerable, would be 
much greater had it been revised and new works 
added. It is evident from the foot-notes that 
Jorgensen has made very considerable use of 
the scholarly studies and articles of Professor 
Gotz of Munich, and yet this critic of Sabatier 
and Muller is barely mentioned in the section 
on modern authorities. 

That Saint Francis was a man of his time, 
that he was thoroughly orthodox in his theology 
and in his relation to the Church, and that he 



was in sympathy with the early aspects of his 
Order's growth are the views expressed by Jor- 
gensen. As an illustration of his viewpoint we 
may cite the following paragraph from Chapter 
IV. of Book III., in regard to the origin and 
early character of the Franciscan Order : 

" The community of Brothers, which Francis of Assisi 
had founded, was from the very first an order of peni- 
tents and apostles, and Francis himself was the Superior 
of the Order. He it was who had written the Rules of 
the Order and had promised obedience to the Pope, he 
it was to whom the permission to preach was given, and 
through whom the others participated therein. It is 
certain that the first six Brothers had the same right as 
Francis to receive new members into the Order, but the 
the new members were taken to Portiuncula, there to 
receive the robe of penitence from Francis himself. 
This reception into the Brotherhood was regarded as 
equivalent in weight to the old time conversion of the 
orders of monkhood by it one left the world with its 
pomp and glory. As a sign of this the supplicant gave 
his possessions to the poor." 

In such a passage we have no implication of 
difference of viewpoint as to his Order between 
Saint Francis and the Church, no hint of a tran- 
sition of a simple lay order into 'an ecclesiastical 
brotherhood of formal character, but merely a 
simple statement of origin and character. A 
great deal of the interest and charm of Sabatier's 
life of Saint Francis lies in the close personal 
touch between author and subject, and the con- 
stant effort to convey what the author thinks 
were Francis's own feelings and viewpoints. 
Jorgensen is content to give the historical facts 
and happenings as he finds them in the sources, 
and does not attempt any psychological inter- 
pretation. The result is that Sabatier is more 
interesting and stimulating reading, while Jor- 
gensen must be considered as better historical 
biography. 

The work of translating Jorgensen's book 
from the Danish original has been well done by 
Dr. T. O'Conor Sloane, though certain curious 
errors of translation and phraseology indicate 
that Dr. Sloane is not himself a close student of 
mediaeval monasticism. To call the " Order of 
Friars Minor " the " Order of Smaller Brothers " 
seems inexcusable ; nor should the well-known 
" Legend of the Three Companions " be referred 
to as "the Three Brothers Legend." Other 
such errors, and many inconsistencies of spell- 
ing and usage, might be pointed out; but such 
criticism is tedious. The index to the transla- 
tion is only fairly satisfactory, being made up 
largely of proper names, "stigmata," for 
example, is omitted from the index. A useful 
feature, however, is a special index for the bib- 
liographical appendix, this index being much 
better than the one for the main work.

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



Dr. Egan's " Everybody's Saint Francis " is 
an eminently readable and popular account of 
the mediaeval story of the saint. Appearing 
originally in a well-known monthly magazine, 
with the remarkable illustrations of M. JBoutet 
de Monvel as their accompaniment, they were 
read with pleasure by many persons who ordin- 
arily do not come into such close contact with 
mediaeval hagiology. In its present form the 
work makes a most attractive gift-book, and will 
be especially appropriate for those meditating a 
winter visit to Italy. It is apparent that Dr. 
Egan's aim has been literary rather than criti- 
cal or historical. It is the legendary Saint 
Francis that he is interested in rather than the 
strictly historical personage. The wonderful 
story of the Wolf of Gubbio is given in detail, 
also the story of the birds ; and we are told, 
seemingly in all seriousness, that Francis went 
among the Mohammedans of Morocco " during 
the crusade of Saint Louis," though in reality 
Francis had died thirty-three years before 
Louis's crusade to Tunis took place. Again, 
Dr. Egan states that Francis died " in the for- 
tieth year of age," on October 3, 1226, while 
he gives the date of his birth as 1181 or 1182. 
Attractively as Dr. Egan tells his story, it is 
surely to be regretted that he is not more accu- 
rate and historical in the handling of his subject. 
As a piece of brilliant literary description his 
chapters are admirable, but they have too much 
of the quality of a fairy tale.

MEMORIALS OF THE ENGLISH 
CATHEDRALS.* 



England's famous highways are many and 
smooth : and on them and from them spreads a 
network of beaten paths leading to the noble 
churches which are her priceless heritage from 
the Middle Ages. Now, as then, these paths 
are worn by the tramp of countless pilgrims' 
feet. The fourteenth century pilgrim, however, 
confined his visits to the great shrines like Can-

terbury, "the holy blisful martir for to seke, 
That hem hath holpen, whan that they were 
seke "; while his secular successor of the twentieth 
century is urged along by curiosity or the thirst 
for aesthetic impressions, and is limited only by 
the conditions of time and purse. From fortress- 
like Durham to brand-new Truro, from stumpy 
Carlisle to historic Canterbury, every one of the 
English cathedrals is sought and scanned by 
thousands of more or less intelligent visitors. 
Herded and hustled by the verger, they gaze 
on the storied beauties of arch and buttress, of 
transept and towers, of rose window and fan 
tracery ; and then, after inscribing their names 
in the visitors' book and depositing their six- 
pences "for the maintenance of the Fabric," 
they move reluctantly away, wondering how 
much they can remember of it all. 

For these and the stay-at-home readers there 
has been no lack of literary helps, "before and 
during and after." The desiccated but trusty 
handbooks of Murray and Baedeker and the in- 
valuable volumes of "Bell's Cathedral Series" 
are portable and useful during the visit; but 
larger monographs and more comprehensive 
treatises have never been wanting to chide and 
correct the reader's ignorance, to stir his imag- 
ination, and to leave him with an adequate 
appreciation of the architectural and historical 
significance of these " masses of gray stone," in 
which, as Ruskin says, " the mediaeval builders 
have left us their adoration." Mrs. Van 
Rensselaer's well-known book on English Cathe- 
drals has for twenty years done this great ser- 
vice for Americans so far as the twelve principal 
churches are concerned; would that she had 
pushed the plan to completion and had given 
us the story of the whole thirty-six English and 
Welsh cathedrals. 

That the subject is one of perennial interest 
would seem to be indicated by the recent appear- 
ance, at about the same time, of three books with 
practically identical titles. The largest of these 
is by Mr. Thomas Dinham Atkinson, who, in 
his own words, " has aimed to sketch the his- 
tories of our cathedral churches in their broader 
aspects, and to connect each so far as is possible 
in narrowcompass with the main stream of archi- 
tectural history "; but also " to approach the 
subject from the point of view of the architect 
the constructor." Following the main line of 
cleavage between the old monkish foundations 
on the one hand and those served by secular 
canons on the other, the author adds to these 
the foundations of Henry VIII. and the new 
sees created in modern times, and adopts this 



1912.] 



THE DIAL

order in his descriptions. Within the two chief 
divisions the canons 1 churches and the monks' 
churches the arrangement is topographical, 
Mr. Atkinson insisting that " the whole of En- 
gland may be easily mapped out into districts, 
each with its distinctive manner ; which is so 
easily recognizable that an antiquary alighting 
from an airship would at once take his bearings 
from the style of the architecture that he saw 
about him." The striking characteristics of the 
two camps are seen in " the vast Norman naves 
of the monks in almost every church from 
Norwich to Gloucester and from Durham to 
Rochester, and in their massy towers from St. 
Albans to Shrewsbury. The churches of the 
secular clergy have a warmth of color, a gener- 
osity of sculpture, a beauty and certain gracious- 
ness of manner, which characterize the fully 
developed mediaeval architecture." 

The marked differences between French and 
English cathedrals are re-told and explained 
the long, low, narrow English churches with 
their central towers, square east ends, and 
western transepts contrasted with the short and 
wide plans, lofty vaults, and faintly emphasized 
transepts of the French the trim lawns and 
immemorial elms which lend an air of peaceful 
seclusion to Salisbury set over against the high- 
shouldered roof of Amiens rising far above the 
huddled town at its feet. Of these and kindred 
features Mr. Atkinson writes with professional 
authority, and in a clear, succinct style which 
keeps the pages free from any load of techni- 
cality. The story of each church is made graphic 
by plans and photographs, and alluring by softly 
beautiful colored plates, which give to the dome 
of St. Paul's its true misty atmosphere and make 
the spire of Salisbury like one of Constable's 
pictures of it (without the rainbow). There is 
a good index, and a useful chart showing in ver- 
tical columns the "biography " of each cathedral. 
Few slips are to be noted : in the Latin inscrip- 
tion over Wren's tomb " urbs " should be 
*' urbis "; and the insertion of the word " Salis- 
bury " after " the new town " on p. xxi. would 
make for clearness. On the whole, this is an 
excellent one-volume presentation of a fascinat- 
ing and wide-spreading theme. 

In Mr. Francis Bond we have an old acquaint- 
ance as a guide, philosopher, and friend for the 
study of ecclesiastical architecture. The first 
edition of his " English Cathedrals Illustrated " 
was published in 1899, and was soon accepted 
as a standard work, in spite of the fact that it 
contained no ground plans, so indispensable to 
reader and visitor alike. The work now appears 



in a fourth edition, with various important 
changes. Beside supplying the ground-plans, 
Mr. Bond has rejected the time-honored nomen- 
clature of Rickman and others, which " at- 
tempted to thrust the history of every cathedral 
into a Procrustean framework of Norman, Early 
English, Decorated, and Perpendicular periods. 
... In this volume the actual building periods 
are treated separately, and no attempt is made 
to cram them into arbitrary imaginary compart- 
ments." This seems pretty strong, in view of 
the acceptance of the traditional divisions by 
most authorities and the fact that so good an 
authority as Mr. Bond was willing to accept 
them only thirteen years ago. 

Having settled the way in which the biog- 
raphy of each church should be studied and the 
interpretation of motive of the different builders, 
Mr. Bond adopts the following classification of 
English and Welsh cathedrals : 13 of the Old 
Foundation (pre-Conquest); 13 of the New 
Foundation, receiving a dean and secular canons 
at the Reformation; and 10 of modern founda- 
tion. He then proceeds to describe them in 
alphabetical order, keeping the four Welsh 
cathedrals by themselves, and reserving for the 
concluding chapter a brief account of Birming- 
ham, Liverpool, and Truro. He writes with 
the full knowledge obtained from professional 
training and repeated personal visits to all the 
cathedrals. To his keen technical interest he 
adds the ardor of an enthusiast, which occasion- 
ally passes into something like extravagance ; 
and his superlatives are as numerous as they 
are pardonable. Everyone who has visited 
the English cathedrals has felt the strain on his 
emotional nature as he contemplated the special 
feature or features of each the octagon of 
Ely, the spire of Salisbury, the stained glass of 
Lichfield and York, the situation of Lincoln and 
Durham, the east windows of Carlisle, York, 
Gloucester ; and it is difficult to speak of such 
glories with a chastened vocabulary. Each is 
the best at the time; and we can smile with 
sympathy at such passages as the following, 
which seem to warn us that if Exeter remains 
unvisited all is lost : 

" Whatever else, then, the student and lover of Gothic 
architecture omits, he must not fail to visit Exeter. He 
will find it fresh and different from anything he has 
seen before. Its unique plan, without central or western 
towers, the absence of obstructive piers at the crossing, 
the constantly uninterrupted vista, the singleness and 
unity of the whole design, the remarkable system of 
proportions, based on breadth rather than height, the 
satisfying massiveness and solidity of the building, in- 
side and outside, the magnificence of its Purbeck piers, 
the delightful color contrast of marble column and sand-

stone arch, the amazing diversity of the window tracery, 
the exquisite carving of the corbels and bosses, the 
wealth of admirable chantries, screens and monuments, 
the superb sedilia, screen and throne, the misericords, 
the vaults, the remarkable engineering feat from which 
its present form results, the originality of the west front 
and of the whole interior and exterior, place Exeter 
cathedral in the very forefront of the triumphs of the 
mediaeval architecture of our country." 

Mr. Bond s eulogies, though highflown, are 
not indiscriminate. He passes a severe and mer- 
ited criticism on the defects of St. Paul's, some 
of them Wren's own, some forced on him by 
the prejudice and ignorance of others. For 
example, the change from Wren's first plan of 
a Greek cross to that of a Latin cross brought 
with it the vaulting of the nave with small 
saucer-shaped domes a most unhappy intro- 
duction to the majesty of the central dome. 
And the unfortunate dead wall on the sides of 
the church, reaching from aisle windows to 
cornice, is condemned by Mr. Bond in vigor- 
ous terms. He quotes with approval another 
writer's characterization of it as " the, most 
unmitigated building sham upon the face of the 
earth"; and adds, " It has absolutely nothing 
to do at all except to hide away some flying 
buttresses the very ugliest eye ever saw 
which Sir Christopher might well be reluctant 
to expose to the jeers of the man in the street. 
... It has been urged that it was built to 
weight the foot of each flying buttress after the 
manner of a Gothic pinnacle. But not even a 
Gothic baby would have provided continuous 
abutment for intermittent thrusts." 

Aside from extremes of praise and blame, 
Mr. Bond's style is generally alert and con- 
vincing. He is decided but not bigoted ; and 
gives generous space to other people's impres- 
sions, reproducing a large part of Mrs. Van 
Rensselaer's well-known description of Lich- 
field, which has almost become a classic. Plans 
and illustrations abound, the latter from excel- 
lent photographs; and help to round out very 
satisfactorily this useful and handsome book. 

The Rev. James Sibree is a genial and well- 
informed clergyman who has all his life cherished 
a hobby for English church architecture. As 
a lad, his first visit to Lincoln opened his eyes 
and roused his interest; and though for forty-five 
years engaged in missionary work in Madagascar, 
his furloughs have been largely filled with visits 
to his first loves ; the result being a work in two 
small volumes, appropriately bound in episcopal 
violet. Instead of Mr. Atkinson's division into 
monks' and canons' churches, and Mr. Bond's 
alphabetical arrangement, Mr. Sibree follows 



geographical lines, Vol. I. being devoted to the 
northern cathedrals, Vol. II. to the southern ; 
which after all is a pretty good plan. So we are 
taken at once to York, Carlisle, and Durham, 
and ten others ; the remaining nineteen and the 
four Welsh cathedrals being reserved for the 
second volume. 

In spite of his modest disclaimers, Mr. Sibree 
turns out to be a delightful guide and compan- 
ion, with plenty of affectionate enthusiasm tem- 
pered by sound judgment, and plenty of literary 
as well as architectural perspective. He is a 
good specimen of the English parson at his best, 
honestly proud of those historic fabrics which 
have kept their existence through centuries of 
Catholic gorgeousness, the simpler glories of 
the Protestant ritual, and the ill-timed assaults 
of Puritan iconoclasm; and he is delighted to 
show them to all who will come with him. His 
little book is well buttressed (the word seems 
appropriate) with various kinds of helps and 
props for readers' memories. There is, to be 
sure, no index; on the other hand, there is a 
table showing the periods of English architec- 
ture according to the time-honored nomenclature 
eschewed by Mr. Bond; a series of block plans, 
useful as snowing the comparative sizes of the 
cathedrals, from lordly York with 63,800 square 
feet of surface down to little Oxford, with its 
11.300; a glossary of architectural terms; a 
good bibliography ; and an abundance of illus- 
trations from photographs. A sketch map shows 
the distribution of the English and Welsh cathe- 
drals, their nearness to the coast suggesting 
the slow progress of Christianity to the interior 
of the island. Another novel feature of the 
book is an excellent anthology on cathedrals, 
selected from British and American poets and 
prose writers. 

It would be difficult to conceive of a more 
exhaustive history of any building than is com- 
prised in the " Memorials of Canterbury Cath- 
edral," by C. Eveleigh Woodruff, one of the 
"six-preachers" of the Cathedral, and William 
Danks, residentiary canon. The design of the 
work, which is a thick octavo of five hundred 
pages, has been " to write a trustworthy, com- 
plete, and compendious account of the Cathedral 
from the earliest times to the present day." As 
is well known, the history of Canterbury falls 
into two great divisions: first, its existence as 
a Benedictine church and convent from early 
Saxon days down to the sixteenth century ; sec- 
ond, its conversion by Henry VIII. into a secular 
foundation with dean and canons, which remains 
the regime of to-day. To accomplish the au- 



1912.J 



THE DIA1,

thors' purpose, it has accordingly been neces- 
sary to confine the range of view strictly to the 
church and its custodians, namely, the prior and 
convent before, and the dean and canons after, 
the " Reformation " of the sixteenth century. 
From this aspect it is remarkable how the priors 
loom and the archbishops dwindle. The range 
of the Primates was nation-wide, sometimes con- 
tinental ; but the prior and his monks stayed at 
home with their beloved church, building and 
expanding, watching and tending, its material 
fabric. They were the real tenants and house- 
keepers: the Archbishop was too often an ab- 
sentee landlord, who visited his cathedral only 
to meddle and disturb. So in this deeply inter- 
esting narrative we read more of Ernulf, Conrad, 
Eastry, Chillenden, Goldstone, and Sellinge 
than of even Becket, Stephen Langton, Rich, 
Chichele, Cranmer, Pole, Laud, and Juxon. 

Our two writers have collaborated with 
marked success. Mr. Woodruff's initials are 
appended to a majority of the chapters ; while 
to Mr. Danks we owe, among other things, a 
long but valuable chapter on "The Life of the 
Monastery," a vivid and informing picture of 
mediaeval conventual life. The authors have 
written with full knowledge based on long resi- 
dence, first-hand examination of the archives, 
and a discriminating use of such standard 
authorities as Somner's "Antiquities of Can- 
terbury," Willis's "Architectural History of the 
Cathedral," and Dean Stanley's " Memorials 
of Canterbury." The book is well supplied 
with illustrations from drawings by Mr. Louis 
Weirter, and with tables of all sorts of details 
pertaining to the economy of the "metropol- 
itical " church, from the marketing accounts of 
the mediaeval convent down to the last stop in 
the modern organ. These minutiae are for the 
curious in such matters ; and do not interfere 
with the success of the work's aim to be both 
compendious and readable.

A BATCH of nine new volumes in the " Home Uni-

pression of the admirable character of this series of 
handbooks of modern knowledge. The series now 
numbers fifty-five volumes, each having its definitely 
circumscribed subject, each subject treated by a com- 
petent hand. Among the new volumes, two in par- 
ticular arrest our attention: "The Colonial Period," 
by Dr. Charles McLean Andrews; and "Great Amer- 
ican Writers," by Professors W P. Trent and John 
Erskine. The latter volume is a brief history of 
American literature, emphasizing the importance of 
the great names, yet neglecting nothing of significance 
in our literary annals.

BOOKS OF TRAVEL AND DESCRIPTION. 
"South America" (Macmillan), "painted by 
A. S. Forrest, described by W. H. Koebel," as its 
title-page announces, is indeed a book in which the 
artist's share is more conspicuous, even if not in real- 
ity more considerable, than the author's. Seventy- 
five pictures, full to overflowing of local color in 
an almost dazzling brilliance of tint, meet the eye as 
one turns the broad pages of the handsome vol- 
ume; and this brave display accords well with Mr. 
Koebel's chapters on what he considers to be the 
continent "which at the present time holds more 
romance than any other out of the great divisions 
of the world." But it is, as he insists, " no longer 
an area populated in parts : it is a continent of pow- 
erful and growing nations." He begins his de- 
scriptive matter with Argentina, then follows with 
Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Guiana, Paraguay, Peru, and 
Uruguay, and closes with the northern republics, 
Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela. In the opening 
of chapter seven one suspects a misprint, rather 
than a confusion of thought on the author's part, in 
the assertion that "from the ascetic point of view 
Paraguay leaves little to be desired "; for the writer 
proceeds to tell us how the country glows with 
flowers, abounds in tropical luxuriance of verdure, 
and, in general, " is not wanting in colour and life." 
" Artistic " may have been written or intended, not 
"ascetic." Certainly the country seems to have left 
Mr. Forrest little to desire from the artistic point 
of view, since eight strikingly brilliant pictures 
illustrate the short chapter devoted to the Para- 
guayans and their wonderful land, whose atmos- 
phere Mr. Koebel finds to be "generally that of 
romance." Large print, an adequate map, and a 
four-page index are among the welcome features of 
this tropically luxuriant volume. 

Almost ninety years have passed since Robert 
Chambers wrote his "Traditions of Edinburgh," a 
book twice remodelled and enlarged by him, and now 
for a third time revived and placed before the pub- 
lic in an edition enriched with thirty illustrations in 
color and more than twice as many pen-and-ink draw- 
ings, a map of the city, old and new, a few additional 
notes, and an index. Mr. James Riddell is the artist, 
and he has done his part in a way to please all who 
open the book. The quarto size of the volume admits 
of unusually large plates, and they are rich in their 
color effects, while the pen-and-ink sketches have a 
quieter charm. The author's preface to his edition 
of 1868 is reprinted, and it will interest the reader 
to learn the circumstances attending the first issue 
of the book. " This little work," we are told, "came 
out in the Augustan days of Edinburgh, when Jef- 
frey and Scott, Wilson and the Ettrick Shepherd, 
Dugald Stewart and Alison, were daily giving the 
productions of their minds to the public, and while 
yet Archibald Constable acted as the unquestioned 
emperor of the publishing world. I was then an insig-

nificant person of the age of twenty; yet, destitute as 
I was both of means and friends, I formed the hope 
of writing something which would attract attention. 
The subject I proposed was one lying readily at hand, 
the romantic things connected with Old Edinburgh." 
The subject proved fruitful even beyond expectation, 
the old inhabitants contributing willingly and abund- 
antly of their early memories; and thus came into 
being the earliest and perhaps still the best of the 
informal guide-books to Edinburgh that have ap- 
peared in such quantity and variety. In its latest 
form it is a volume of imposing proportions and 
handsome appearance. (J. B. Lippincott Co.) 

Mr. Dwight L. Elrnendorf, popular lecturer and 
expert photographer, has turned his skill with pen 
and camera to good account in a richly illustrated 
volume of travel in Palestine. " A Camera Crusade 
through the Holy Land" (Scribner) contains three 
short preliminary chapters on "The South," "The 
North," and " Jerusalem," touching especially on the 
Bible associations recalled by different scenes in the 
course of the author's travels ; and then follow the 
camera views themselves, each a full-page plate, with 
an appropriate scriptural quotation and a number of 
Bible references on the opposite page. The land- 
scapes are all admirable for clearness and finish, 
and animals and human beings are caught in lifelike 
pose. There are one hundred of these pictures, the 
frontispiece, showing a woman of Samaria, with a 
water-jar on her head, an infant on one arm, and 
two little girls at her side, being colored with much 
verisimilitude. The cover of the book, with its red 
cross on a gold shield, and other appropriate decora- 
tions, is aesthetically satisfying. 

The spell of Egypt has been given attempted inter- 
pretation by many artists, but by none more success- 
fully we should say than by Mr. Walter Tyndale, 
R. I., whose volume on the Pharaohs' country pub- 
lished a few seasons ago will be remembered as a 
gift-book of unusual charm. Mr. Tyndale's several 
Egyptian sojourns since that time have now borne 
fruit in a new book entitled "An Artist in Egypt" 
(Hodder & Stoughton). Unlike many of his fellow- 
artists, Mr. Tyndale knows how to write as well as 
to paint, and his spicy record of personal impressions 
and experiences is decidedly worth while for its 
own sake. But the pictures are still better. These 
consist of twenty-seven reproductions in full color, 
separately printed and mounted on blank pages, 
within a border of gold lines. They portray with 
remarkable skill and charm and opulence of color- 
effect the picturesque scenes of Cairo and its neigh- 
boring country. A minor feature of the volume 
worthy of particular mention is the design for the 
end-leaves, depicting in soft tints a camel train mov- 
ing across the moonlit desert. For the past or pro- 
spective visitor to the Nile country we could suggest 
no more appropriate gift than this handsome volume. 

Another agreeable and useful volume about 
Edinburgh and the surrounding country appears in 
Mr. Francis Watt's "Edinburgh and the Lothians" 
(Stokes), with colored illustrations by Mr. Walter 



Dexter, R.B.A. The term "Lothians," less familiar 
to most Americans than to Mr. Watt and his fellow 
Britons, seems now to be confined to the counties of 
Edinburgh, Linlithgow, and Haddington Midloth- 
ian, West Lothian, and East Lothian, respectively 
though in early days Lothian meant all that part of 
the Scottish lowlands between the English border 
and the river Forth. Naturally it is with Midlothian 
that the present volume chiefly deals, touching espe- 
cially on the historic buildings and the literary and 
art associations of the Scottish capital. The remain- 
ing ten of the book's twenty-nine chapters take the 
reader to such historic places as Hawthornden, Ros- 
lin, Haddington, Dunbar, North Berwick, and Tan- 
tallon Castle. The artist has chosen some of the 
most interesting scenes for his brush, giving us pleas- 
ing glimpses of Holyrood and Arthur's Seat, Edin- 
burgh Castle from Greyfriars Churchyard, Roslin 
Chapel, Linlithgow Palace from the Loch, Tantallon 
Castle, and other memorable buildings and pictur- 
esque views. A map of the Lothians would have 
been an acceptable addition to this excellent and 
attractive volume. 

A quick eye for whatever is novel and distinctive 
in Norwegian character and Norwegian customs, 
and for the charms of Norwegian scenery, is pos- 
sessed by Mr. Harold Simpson, as proved by his 
fresh and stimulating volume entitled "Rambles in 
Norway" (Estes). He rambles with a fine resolve 
to be pleased with whatever he encounters; and so 
his chapters bear such headings as these: "An En- 
chanted Voyage," "A Haven of Peace," " A Perfect 
Day," "The Garden of the North," "The Call of 
the Mountains," and "The Wonderful Geiranger." 
But there is one less cheerful chapter, entitled "An 
Unfortunate Day," which chronicles the discomforts 
of a journey from Vossevangen to Gudvangen behind 
a lazy horse and in the rain. The rambler found 
the conditions for rambling peculiarly favorable in 
Norway, especially for one not overburdened with 
worldly wealth. Excellent inns with a daily charge 
of not more than five kroner (or about five shillings) 
are met with outside the large cities, and on the 
coastwise steamers the satisfactory quality of the food 
seems to be only equalled by the steward's indiffer- 
ence as to whether payment is tendered or that tri- 
fling formality is omitted altogether. The book, both 
in its reading matter and in its many illustrations, 
colored and monotone, inspires a desire to ramble 
among the lakes and fjords and mountains of the 
land of the midnight sun. 

After his wanderings in London, Paris, and Hol- 
land, Mr. E. V. Lucas turns to Italy and gives us 
" A Wanderer in Florence " (Macmillan), which 
concerns itself chiefly, as was to have been expected 
and desired, with the art and architecture of the 
city of Giotto and Michelangelo and Brunelleschi. 
Appreciative readers will value the book not so 
much for what it tells us, which is more or less 
matter of common knowledge, as for the manner of 
the telling. Describing the art treasures of the 
Accademia, he counsels the visitor, before leaving, to

" glance at the tapestries near the main entrance, 
just for fun. That one in which Adam names the 
animals is so delightfully naive that it ought to be 
reproduced as a nursery wall-paper." And he pro- 
ceeds to point out some of its delightful naivetes. 
Concerning Giotto, he thinks that Ruskin has hurt 
that artist's reputation by taking him peculiarly 
under his wing and persistently calling him "the 
Shepherd," thus making him appear " as something 
between a Sunday-school superintendent and the 
Creator." But Giotto had a dry humor of his own, 
as proved by his reply to King Robert of Naples 
when that monarch said to him on a very hot day : 
" Giotto, if I were you I should leave off painting 
for a while." "Yes," returned the artist, "if I were 
you I should." Sixteen Florentine views are given 
in color, the work of Mr. Harry Morley, and there 
are thirty-eight half-tone reproductions of famous 
masterpieces in painting and sculpture. 

Mr. Adolphe Smith, who claims " a lifelong ac- 
quaintance with the Principality of Monaco," is the 
author of a large book, " Monaco and Monte Carlo," 
which holds within its covers more information about 
that anomalous little country and its famous gam- 
bling casino than any other one volume known to us. 
Mr. Smith has participated in a number of inter- 
national conferences at Monaco, and has otherwise 
had opportunity to learn about all that is to be 
learned concerning the subject of his book. It is a 
strange community that he describes, "a small 
principality where, proportionately speaking, more 
money is spent on local government, on public works, 
on the promotion of original research, on the arts 
and sciences, than is the case in any other part of 
the world " and all without a penny of taxation 
other than the indirect taxation imposed on users of 
tobacco and matches and perhaps a few other things. 
The festive foreigner pays practically all the bills, 
and the croupier collects the revenue. It is all an 
absorbingly interesting story that Mr. Smith has to 
tell, and he is well seconded in his undertaking by 
Mr. Charles Maresco Pearce, who contributes eight 
colored drawings, while the camera is responsible 
for forty-eight uncolored views. The book is sub- 
stantially and handsomely bound, and its typography 
is of the best. (J. B. Lippincott Co.) 

Introducing his "Cities of Lombardy" (Macmil- 
lan), Mr. Edward Hutton says: "It is my purpose 
in this book to consider the nature and the history 
of this country, to recapture and to express as well 
as I may my delight in it, so that something of its 
beauty and its genius may perhaps disengage itself 
from my pages, and the reader feel what I have felt 
about it though he never stir ten miles from his own 
home." Mr. Button's chapters treat historically and 
descriptively of a dozen or more Lombard cities, and 
he has been ably seconded in his undertaking by Mr. 
Maxwell Armfield, who contributes twelve exquisite 
illustrations in color. The blue of the Italian sky is 
caught and perhaps a little too much of it occa- 
sionally in these sunny views of beautiful north- 
Italian scenes. There are also twelve half-tone 



illustrations of merit in their mechanical way. No 
lover of Italy can fail to find enjoyment in the vol- 
ume. It is of convenient size for the hand or the 
pocket, has a map adequate to the reader's needs, 
and an index. 

In little more than two years the greatest expo- 
sition ever undertaken, as the San Franciscans 
proudly maintain, will open its doors in celebration 
of the completion of the Panama Canal; and it is 
not too soon to begin reading up about the wonder- 
ful city where that exposition is to be held. Mrs. 
Helen Throop Purdy has prepared a full account 
of "San Francisco, as it Was, as it Is, and How to 
See it," and Messrs. Paul Elder & Co. have issued 
the volume in style similar to that of their earlier 
books, "California the Beautiful" and ''The Van- 
ished Ruin Era." Paper and print and illustrations, 
board covers and jacket, everything is in brown of 
varying shades. Twenty-seven chapters give the 
city's early history and later fortunes, describe its 
chief points of interest, furnish glimpses of the men 
who have made it famous, advise the reader how 
best to see its noteworthy features, and in closing 
touch briefly on its environs. Maps of the bay 
region, the city itself, and the exposition site at 
Harbor View, are added. More than two hundred 
illustrations from photographs and other sources 
make visible to the eye much that is described in the 
text. It is all a stirring and a remarkable story, 
this account of a city founded by the Spanif-h, given 
a new birth by American gold-hunters, and stimu- 
lated to fresh vigor by the ravages of fire and earth- 
quake. 

Oxford is pictorially treated, with fine effect, in 
a volume of colored views, with brief descriptive 
and historical notes by Mr. Edward C. Alden, author 
of a useful guide-book to the University. " Fifty 
Water-Color Drawings of Oxford " (Estes) appears 
to be the work of more than one hand, though 
most of the illustrations bear the signature " W. 
Manhison." Glimpses of many of the college build- 
ings and along the High Street and elsewhere, with 
interior views of Christ Church Cathedral, outlooks 
on the Isis and the Cherwell, and peeps inside 
some of the quadrangles, are given by the skilful 
artists whose work is so agreeably reproduced in 
the book. A certain fondness for purplish tints is 
manifest in not a few of the pictures, but no two 
persons see nature in exactly the same colors, so that 
one need not complain. The short accompanying 
comments to the views are welcome in their judicious 
mingling of description and dates. The plates are 
loosely attached to dark brown leaves, and each is 
faced by a page of notes. Buckram and pasteboard, 
with an Oxford scene on the front cover and the 
university coat of arms on the back cover, constitute 
the binding. 

The picturesque and the mediaeval, says Mr. Albert 
B. Osborne, were what he went to find in his first 
and all subsequent visits to Europe; and in "Picture 
Towns of Europe" (McBride) he gives with pen and

mistake not, some of the results of this quest. His 
chapters and his illustrations present in very inviting 
form some of the picturesque and the historically 
interesting aspects of Clovelly, Mont St. Michel, Car- 
cassonne, San Gimignano, Bussaco, Cintra, Toledo, 
Ronda, Bruges, Middelburg, Ragusa, Salzburg, 
Gruyeres, Rothenburg, and Hildesheim. A map of 
that portion of Europe visited by the author is ap- 
pended. Northern Europe, as he acknowledges, he 
has still to explore ; but for the picturesque in west- 
ern and southern Europe he has had his eyes open, 
to good effect. The book has a striking cover-design, 
and its many illustrations have unusual charm. 

Some part at least of the fruit of his travels in 
the Holy Land is offered to his readers by the Rev. 
Cortland Myers, D.D., in a little book appropriate 
to the Christmas season, " Where Heaven Touched 
the Earth " (American Tract Society). Its nine 
chapters treat of Bethlehem, Nazareth, the Wilder- 
ness of Judea, the Sea of Galilee, Jacob's Well, 
Gethsemane, Calvary, the Church of the Holy Sep- 
ulchre, and the Mount of Olives. Colored illustra- 
tions, chiefly from photographs of scenes in the Holy 
Land, are interspersed, and a pleasing cover-design 
adds to the book's attractiveness. Dr. Myers's chap- 
ters abound in suggestive comment, literary and 
historical allusion, and frequent reference to the 
scriptural account of the events that have made 
memorable the places visited by him. His book, 
convenient in size for the pocket, would be a good 
companion for the tourist in Palestine ; but its 
readers will not be restricted to the tourist class. 

HOLIDAY ART BOOKS. 

Though the history of American painting and 
sculpture has engaged the service of many pens, a 
full account of the reproductive graphic arts in this 
country would be hard to find. Mr. Frank Weiten- 
kampf attempts to supply this lack in his careful and 
interesting work, "American Graphic Art'' (Holt), 
whose declared purpose is " to group scattered farts 
in a brief but clear review of the whole field of Ameri- 
can graphic art. It is not intended to present a 
detailed list including every artist who may have 
practiced any of these arts in this country, but to 
offer a survey that will bring out salient or char- 
acteristic personalities and tendencies." The fifteen 
chapters of the book treat successively etching, early 
and modern; engraving in line and stipple, in the 
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries ; mezzotint 
(the art of rock and scraper); aquatint and some 
other tints; wood-engraving, and the new school of 
the same ; painter- wood-engraving ; lithography as a 
business and as an art ; the illustrators ; caricature ; 
the comic paper; the book-plate ; applied graphic art, 
from the business card to the poster. Illustrative 
plates to the number of thirty-seven are scattered 
through the book, but no attempt has been made to 
reproduce the colored poster or other colored print. 
The specimens of work in black and white are well 
chosen and interesting. Of peculiar historic interest 
is the reproduction of Paul Revere's copper-engraving 



of the Rev. Jonathan Mayhew, a print only recently 
discovered in the New York Public Library. There 
is also given a reproduction of the first known wood- 
engraving executed in the colonies, John Foster's 
portrait of Richard Mather. The work of such noted 
modern etchers and engravers as Whistler, Mr. 
Timothy Cole, Mr. Joseph Pennell, the late Howard 
Pyle, and many others, is represented among the 
plates and receives notice from the author. It is a 
large field to attempt to cover in a single volume, 
but what has been done within that limit appears to 
have been well done. Mr. Weitenkampf is Chief 
of the Arts and Prints Divisions of the New York 
Public Library, and author of "How to Appreciate 
Prints." The present volume will be prized by 
print lovers. 

The popular series of "The Art Galleries of Eu- 
rope " published by Messrs. L. C. Page & Co. receives 
an important addition this year in Mr. Charles C. 
Heyl's tasteful volume on "The Art of the Uffizi 
Palace and the Florence Academy," to which are 
added notes on the minor museums of Florence, with 
a bibliography, lists of artists and their woiks, and 
an index to the book. Fifty illustrations from photo- 
graphs serve to gwre an idea of the chief master- 
pieces of painting and sculpture described by the 
author, whose purpose has been to omit the details of 
technique and to bring his readers face to face with , 
"the great, eternal, living soul" of the artist's work, 
"touching sympathetically upon such elements in 
the intellectual intent and content of the productions 
as may afford the keenest enjoyment, coupled with 
the most complete understanding and appreciation." 
His first chapter, entitled "The Genesis of theRe- 
naissance: the First Religious Revival," gives the 
suggestive story of San Giovanni Gualberto and the 
founding of the monastery of Vallombrosa. The 
treasures of the Pitti Palace, having been treated in 
an earlier volume of the series, are omitted in the 
present work. As a popular guide to the art gal- 
leries of Florence, the two volumes together appear 
to leave little to be desired. The illustrations, though 
small, are beautifully clear, and the commentary 
abounds in pertinent information and judicious 
criticism. Externally, the issues of this series are 
attractive to the eye. 

A noteworthy contribution to the literature of the 
fine arts is made by Mr. George Leland Hunter in 
his scholarly and handsome volume on "Tapestries: 
Their Origin, History, and Renaissance " (Lane). 
"To me personally,'' he declares, "tapestries are the 
most interesting and delightful form of art, combin- 
ing as they do picture interest with story interest and 
texture interest." The picture interest and the story 
interest are to be found in the book's numerous illus- 
trative plates (four of them in color) and in the 
author's accompanying commentary ; the texture in- 
terest one can fully appreciate only by studying tapes- 
tries themselves. Where the most, famous of them are 
to be seen may be learned from Mr. Hunter's pages, 
as also the historic significance and the peculiar 
merits of these wonderful products of the weaver's

and the dyer's art. His chapters treat of the renais- 
sance of tapestries, Gothic tapestries, Renaissance 
tapestries, Flemish and Burgundian looms, English 
looms, the Gobelins, and other famous tapestries, 
some details as to the texture of tapestries, designs 
and portraits in tapestries, signatures and makers, 
shapes and sizes, the Bible in tapestries, history and 
romance in tapestries, light and shade and perspec- 
tive, the care of tapestries, tapestry museums, sales, 
expositions, and books, the tapestries in the Metro- 
politan Museum, and other related subjects. The 
frontispiece is a colored reproduction of the "Ver- 
tumnus and Pomona " tapestry in the Casimir- 
Pe'rier collection, a work of art valued at $120 000, 
and the most perfect Beauvais- Boucher tapestry ever 
seen by the author. This and the other colored prints 
suggest remarkably well the rich harmonies of some 
of these masterpieces. The half-tone illustrations 
give a good idea of the design. A full bibliography 
and index are provided. 

Miss Helen W. Henderson's profusely illustrated 
work on "The Art Treasures of Washington" 
(Page) is the fourth and latest addition to the 
handy and attractive series on " The Art Galleries 
of America." The purpose of the book, as explained 
on the title-page, is to give "an account of the Cor- 
coran Gallery of Art and of the National Gallery 
and Museum, with descriptions and criticisms of 
their contents ; including, also, an account of the 
works of art in the Capitol, and in the Library of 
Congress, and of the most important statuary in the 
city." The unwise legislation of a Congress not 
famed for it* discriminating love of the fine arts has 
so burdened the capital with examples of the showy 
and futile that one is in danger of losing sight of 
the lesser number of genuine masterpieces to be met 
with in a tour of the Washington galleries and other 
public buildings. Hence the need of some such in- 
telligently selective guide and critic as is furnished 
in Miss Henderson's manual. In addition to paint- 
ings and sculpture she gives especial attention to the 
National Museum's collection of aboriginal Amer- 
ican pottery, the largest and best exhibition of its 
kind in the world. Sixty-six reproductions from 
photographs illustrate the volume, which also con- 
tains a bibliography and index. 

Successive phases of the artist's life from age to 
age are illustrated in Mr. Stewart Dick's volume 
on " Master Painters : Pages from the Romance of 
Art " (Small. Maynard & Co.). Its dozen chapters 
begin with the monkish painters of the fifteenth cen- 
tury and close with Rossetti and the Pre-Raphaelites. 
The three chief stages in this progress of art are 
found in the monastic period of painting and illumi- 
nating, the period of the bottega or workshop, and 
that of the art schools. In each and all the creator 
of beauty has commonly lived a life apart, building 
up a world of his own, as Mr. Dick says, while the 
material world " has become an automaton ; it is 
wound up, and the stream keeps pouring out relent- 
lessly useful things, useless things, but all things 
that will sell, and all dead things. The artist is 



forced to take refuge in a backwater if he would 
produce living work." Photographic reproductions 
of sixteen masterpieces of art are scattered through 
the volume. No believer in " the glory and good 
of art " can fail to find enjoyment in Mr. Dick's 
sympathetic treatment of his theme. 

To one unacquainted with the progress of artistic 
photography, the exhibition of present-day camera 
work contained in the 1912 volume of " Photograms 
for the Year " (New York : Tennant & Ward) will 
come as a revelation. Almost every sort of subject 
available to the painter seems to have been utilized 
in these hundred- odd plates, and often with artistic 
results of a surprisingly high order. In this volume, 
the seventeenth annual issue of the work, the page 
size has been increased very considerably, thus 
affording opportunity for reproduction on a worthier 
scale than obtained in the previous volumes. Be- 
sides a general review of the year's work by the 
editor, Mr. F. G. Mortimer, there are nine brief 
articles by various hands dealing with progress and 
developments in the field of camera work through- 
out the world. The amateur photographer who 
finds this book in his Christmas stocking is likely to 
be a very satisfied person. 

HOLIDAY EDITIONS OF STANDARD LITERATURE. 

Many years ago, in the wilds of Central Africa, 
where Dante, Homer, and Shakespeare were often 
his sole companions except the natives, Mr. H. 
B. Cotterill conceived a desire to translate the 
"Odyssey." At last he has been able to accomplish 
his purpose, and a hexameter version, in a volume 
of quarto size, clearly printed on heavy paper and 
adorned with twenty-four drawings by Mr. Patten 
Wilson, is the gratifying result. It was a rather 
bold venture to translate Homer in the metre of the 
original, so little has popular favor hitherto smiled 
on this exotic form of English verse. Longfellow's 
" Evangeline " is accepted for other beau ies than 
those of its metre. However, there is no conceivable 
form of Homeric translation that has not its own 
peculiar weaknesses. Those who are familiar with 
Homer, or even only with Virgil, in the original, and 
thus have their ear attuned to the six-foot measure 
of these poets, will easily fall into the swing of Mr. 
Cotterill's verse; others are likely to trip occasion- 
ally, especially over certain proper names whose 
English accent has yielded to the "quantity" of 
the original syllables, as in the line, ' Hailing from 
Dulichium. of the choicest youths of the island," and 
"Him sage Telemachus addressing in turn gave 
answer." In its spirit, the translation is truly 
Homeric, the language simple and dignified, the 
faithfulness of rendering all that could be expected 
under the restrictions of metre. The artist's draw- 
ings are in many instances finely conceived and of 
great beauty. (Dana Estes & Co.) 

Goldsmith could not have wished for a better set 
of illustrations to his comedy, " She Stoops to Con- 
quer," than those designed with keen appreciation 
of the humors of the piece by Mr. Hugh Thomson

in an elaborate edition from the house of Hodder 
& Stoughton. The play, thus issued, with twenty- 
five colored plates and other drawings in line, makes 
a volume of quarto dimensions running to nearly two 
hundred pages. Heavy paper and large type are 
used, with broad margins and richly decorated bind- 
ing, end-leaves of appropriate design, and an embel- 
lished box. Mr. Thomson's water-colors for such 
is their appearance in reproduction have often a 
Watteau-like delicacy and grace that is very pleasing, 
while the rude joviality of certain other scenes is 
also well depicted. Nothing short of seeing the play 
itself well staged and acted could convey a fuller 
enjoyment of its merits than this fine setting pro- 
vided for it by artist and printer and binder. 

Hardly a year passes now that does not witness a 
fresh attempt to interpret one or more of Poe's poems 
by aid of pictorial illustration. The latest noteworthy 
effort of this sort is on the part of Mr. Edmund 
Dulac, who has made twenty-eight colored pictures 
for a sumptuous edition of " The Bells, and Other 
Poems " (Hodder) in a quarto volume of imposing 
appearance in its elaborately embossed, cream- 
colored binding, with print of the largest, margins 
of the most generous width, and paper of the heavi- 
est. The illustrations are striking for their color- 
effects, and often too for their drawing. No one 
but Poe could have evoked such creations. The 
picture to "The Haunted Palace," for example, is 
a veritable nightmare in color and design, that to 
" Alone " is beautifully expressive, those to " The 
Bells " are what Poe himself might have been glad 
to be able to draw. Other smaller illustrations in 
a single tint head some of the poems, and all have 
a character appropriate to their theme. 

The spirit of romance breathes in Mr. W. Hath- 
erell's illustrations to "Romeo and Juliet" in the 
elaborately ornate edition of the play issued this sea- 
son by Messrs. Hodder & Stoughton. Twenty-two 
of these pictures, rich even to the verge of excess (or 
perhaps beyond it) in coloring, and frequently of 
striking and beautiful design, are scattered through 
the book. The charm of Juliet's young beauty is 
now and again successfully caught, and the con- 
ception of her old nurse is excellent. Large print, 
heavy paper, generous spacing, broad margins, a 
graceful cover design in green and gold these are 
among the book's attractive features. It is a sub- 
stantial quarto in form, and is provided with a box 
appropriately ornamented. 

A request for a list of the flowers named in T. B. 
Aldrich's poems, in order that the garden of the 
Aldrich memorial house at Portsmouth might have 
growing in it all the flowers so mentioned, called 
forth from Mrs. Aldrich a copy of all the lines 
wherein the desired names occurred. Thus not only 
the blossoms themselves, but also the accompanying 
foliage, so to speak, the poet's widow has offered to 
such as choose to accept the floral gift. A thin vol- 
ume of exquisite design, entitled " The Shadow of 
the Flowers " (Houghton), contains these passages 
from Aldrich's poems, with drawings in harmony 



with the text from the pencils of Mr. Talbot Aldrich 
and Mr. Carl J. Nordell. The right-hand pages 
alone are used, and the verses as well as the draw- 
ings above them appear to be the work of the artist's 
pencil. Flowers and bits of landscape make up most 
of the illustrations, with an occasional human figure. 
The cover design shows a part of a wild rosebush, 
with accompanying verses. The book is neatly 
bound in light-gray boards with linen back. 

The effect of a richly illuminated manuscript is 
produced by Mr. Alberto Sangorski's decorative set- 
ting to the "Sermon on the Mount" (Estes). Chap- 
ters five, six, and seven of St. Matthew are written 
out in black letter, with elaborate initial letters done 
in gold and colors, and with a special border for each 
page. Each leaf is double, so that only one side of 
the paper is printed on, and the creamy tint suggests 
parchment or vellum. Holman Hunt's painting "The 
Light of the World," in Saint Paul's Cathedral, is 
reproduced for the further ornamentation of the vol- 
ume. In elaboration and splendor, these decorative 
designs are noteworthy exhibitions of the illustrator's 
and illuminator's art. The first and last verses are 
in red, and rubricated initial letters also sprinkle 
the page. 

The world never wearies of Mrs. Gaskell's little 
masterpiece, "Cranford." Every holiday season 
there will be, somewhere and in some form, a new 
edition of the story, perhaps more than one. This 
year Mr. H. M. Brock, R.I., has drawn half a dozen 
pictures in cheerful colors for a well-printed reissue 
of this little classic. The costumes, the graces, the 
old-fashioned formalities, of Miss Matty, Mr. Hoi- 
brook, Captain Brown, and other characters in the 
story, are well depicted by the artist, and add a fresh 
charm to the simple narrative. (J. B. Lippincott 
Co.) 

HOLIDAY FICTION. 

Nineteen stories, told with Dr. Henry van Dyke's 
well-known charm of manner, are grouped in the 
volume entitled "The Unknown Quantity" (Scrib- 
ner). The thread uniting the stories their author 
calls "the sign of the unknown quantity, the sense 
of mystery and strangeness, that runs through human 
life." The sub-title to the collection, " A Book of 
Romance and Some Half-Told Tales," calls forth a 
further word of explanation in the preface. Inter- 
spersed between the longer stories are a number of 
" tales that are told in a briefer and different man- 
ner. They are like etchings in which more is sug- 
gested than is in the picture. For this reason they 
are called Half-Told Tales, in the hope that they 
may mean to the reader more than they say." The 
mere names of some of the stories, since nothing 
more can be given here, will serve to hint at the rich- 
ness and variety of the volume. " The Wedding- 
Ring," " The Ripening of the Fruit," " The King's 
Jewel," " The Music-Lover," " An Old Game," " A 
Change of Air," "The Return of the Charm," "The 
Mansion " these and other titles have the true ring 
to the story-reader's ear. Good illustrations, both 
colored and in black-and-white, are provided by

various artists, and a cheerful design in blue and 
gold enlivens the book's exterior. 

Mr. Jack London's popular story, "The Call of 
the Wild," the tale of a noble St. Bernard dog 
stolen from his California home and pressed into 
sledge service in Alaska, where he finally reverts to 
the primitive condition of his kind and runs wild as 
the leader of a pack of wolves, celebrates its decen- 
nial anniversary by appearing in an elaborately- 
illustrated holiday edition (Macmillan). Mr. Paul 
Bransom has provided the stirring and touching 
narrative with a great number of appropriate illus- 
trations, both full-page color plates and smaller 
colored and uncolored drawings. A first-rate story. 
to begin with, the tale thus reissued becomes more 
alluring than before, and will doubtless win for itself 
many new readers. 

Mr. Richard Le Gallienne addresses his readers in 
parables in "The Maker of Rainbows" (Harper), a 
collection of fourteen fairy tales and fables supposed 
to have been found by an old-clothes dealer in one 
of the pockets of a poet's dress suit which the poet 
had sold in order to get money to buy a rose for his 
sweetheart; so that, with this touching story of the 
careless and improvident poet, there are fifteen tales 
in all, one of them being poetry in form as well as 
in substance. Miss Elizabeth Shippen Green has 
illustrated the book with two colored and three 
uncolored drawings, in harmony with the tone of 
the text; and the rainbow-maker himself, a cheery 
grinder of scissors and knives, is brightly depicted 
on the cover in the midst of a group of eager chil- 
dren. 

Mrs. Barclay's popular success of last year, "The 
Following of the Star" (Putnam), has followed the 
example of others of her widely-read romances and 
gone into a richly illustrated and ornamented holiday 
edition, handsomely bound and artistically boxed. 
Mr. F. H. Townsend has provided eight colored pic- 
tures, Miss Margaret Armstrong has designed the 
page-borders and other decorations, and the printer 
has not been lacking in the proper discharge of his 
important duties. The vivid illustrations harmonize 
well with the reading matter, and in every way this 
sumptuous volume appears to be what an edition de 
luxe of Mrs. Barclay's novel ought to be. 

Republished in holiday book form after its serial 
appearance, Mr. Robert W. Chambers's " Blue-Bird 
Weather" (Appleton), with seven illustrations by 
Mr. Charles Dana Gibson, makes as pretty a love 
story as any young girl need ask for. It is the tale 
of a duck-shooting expedition in which the duck- 
shooter loses his heart to the pretty daughter of the 
keeper of the shooting box where he puts up, and of 
course it all ends as it should and they live happily 
ever after. The narrative is brisk, the pictures good, 
and the book, well printed and neatly bound and 
jacketed, shows nothing to find fault with unless 
one chooses to take exception to a rather glaring 
error in a Latin quotation. But the lover of love 
stories will not allow so small a matter as this to 
disturb his or her enjoyment of the romance. 



Miss Zona Gale's story entitled " Christmas " 
(Macmillan) appears fittingly at this' time of the 
year in artistic book- form, with half a dozen brightly 
cheerful pictures in color by Mr. Leon V. Solon. 
The very names that greet the eye in its pleasant 
pages are an earnest of good things in store for the 
reader. Old Trail Town is the scene of the rural 
drama, and such names as Mary Chavah, Ebenezer 
Rule, Tab Winslow, Jenny Wing, Mis' Mortimer 
Bates, and Buff Miles are borne by the actors. The 
book is attractively bound in cream-colored cloth, 
richly decorated in green and red and gilt. 

MISCELLANEOUS HOLIDAY BOOKS. 
A pleasant style and a disposition to pass with 
no unnecessary delay from one subject to the next 
distinguish Mrs. William Wilson Sale's handsome 
volume on " Old Time Belles and Cavaliers " (Lip- 
pincott), a collection of thirty biographical studies 
beginning with Pocahontas and ending with Anne 
Carmichael. Mrs. Sale (Edith Tunis Sale she signs 
her name to her book) believes that "the stories of 
womanly heroism and manly bravery with which the 
lives of the old time belles and cavaliers are indelibly 
associated should be familiar to all readers of Amer- 
ican history ; for while the English men and women 
of that day were lounging at court or taking their 
ease at Bath, their kinsmen and women over the 
sea were suffering and enduring the privations of 
war and discomforts of life in a new country." 
Accordingly the claims of the more prominent of 
these belles and cavaliers to our admiration are 
touched upon in a manner to entertain and never 
to weary in Mrs. Sale's book. Robert Carter, or 
"King" Carter, William Byrd,Mary Ball and Martha 
Dandridge (mother and wife, respectively, of Wash- 
ington), Alice De Lancey, Benjamin Thompson 
(Count Rumford), Peggy Chew and Peggy Shippen, 
Dolly Payne, Theodosia Burr, with others of equal 
note, have their characters briefly drawn and the 
things for which they are to be remembered recalled 
to mind, while there is no lack of portraits to help 
fix the various personages in one's mind. The book 
forms a sort of national portrait gallery, or one 
room, of peculiar interest, in such a gallery. 

" An attempt to catch the spirit of the keen joys 
of the winter season " is the explanatory sub-title of 
" A Book of Winter Sports " (Macmillan), edited 
by Mr. J. C. Dier and illustrated in lively manner 
with both colored plates and half- tone reproductions 
of photographs. The sources from which readable 
and often instructive matter has been taken are 
numerous and varied. Dickens, Burns, de Amicis, 
Christopher North, Blackmore, " The Scientific 
American," " Outing," " The Saturday Review," 
w$|th many other writers and a few other periodicals, 
have been drawn upon for chapters on ice-motoring, 
skating, curling, snow-shoeing, skiing, toboganning, 
sleighing, and other ice and snow pastimes. The 
newest and therefore perhaps the most interesting 
of these sports is ice-motoring, while the wind-driven 
ice-yacht is still a fascinating toy and one that, under

favorable conditions, can still outstrip the gasolene- 
propelled sledge. Directions and diagrams for build- 
ing certain kinds of ice craft are given in the book ; 
but these may of course be omitted by those not 
mechanically gifted, who will find more pleasure in 
" Mr. Winkle on the Ice," from " Pickwick," or 
the song of " The Jolly Curlers " by James Hogg, 
both of which, and many other readable miscellanies 
of a nature suitable to the book's purpose, are to be 
met with between its covers. The selections are all 
short, and the volume has that brisk air appropriate 
to the winter season which it celebrates. 

An echo of the Dickens centennial reaches our 
shores in Mr. Edwin Pugh's careful and interesting 
work on "The Charles Dickens Originals" (Scrib- 
ner). Of the real characters that inspired the novel- 
ist to the creation of their famous doubles in fiction 
no genuine Dickens-lover will ever tire of reading. 
Such chapters as those of Mr. Pugh on Mary 
Hogarth, Maria Beadnell, the Brothers Cheeryble, 
some Pickwickians, relics from " The Old Curiosity 
Shop," certain criminal prototypes, and so on, afford 
both entertainment and instruction. The portraits 
in the volume are many and interesting, as for ex- 
ample that of Sam Vale ("Sam Weller"), Henry 
Burnett ( " Nicholas Nickleby "), Mary Hogarth 
(" Kate Nickleby " and other characters), Maria 
Beadnell ("Dolly Varden" and other characters), 
Mrs. Cooper ("Little Dorrit"), John Dickens 
("Mr. Micawber"), Lord Mansfield ("Barnaby 
Rudge"), and many more. An index of names 
and book-titles closes the book. Mr. Pugh is 
already known as the author of " Charles Dickens, 
the Apostle of the People," and his qualifications 
for such a work as the present will not be ques- 
tioned. The book, with its frontispiece reproducing 
the Maclise portrait of Dickens, and with its other 
attractive features, is one of the most inviting of 
recent works about the great novelist. 

The proverbial Irishman, the Irishman of the 
Victorian novelists and dramatists, vanishes like an 
illusion dispelled in Mr. George A. Birmingham's 
chapters on "The Lighter Side of Irish Life" 
(Stokes). Seen with the eyes of this native of Erin, 
Patrick becomes a much less picturesque and amus- 
ing character, a much more matter-of-fact and unim- 
aginative mortal, than it pleases us to conceive him. 
"Nothing is more characteristic of the Irishman 
to-day than his freedom from illusion and his power 
of seeing facts," declares Mr. Birmingham, and we 
are glad to arrive at the truth of the matter as he sees 
it. But he half acknowledges that the accepted and 
familiar picture of Patrick as he used to be may not 
have been entirely false. With all this stripping of 
the Irishman of his picturesque trappings, however, 
there remains enough of interest and charm in his 
personality to furnish material for a baker's dozen 
of unusually readable and often amusing sketches in 
the author's best vein. He takes occasion, naturally 
enough, to insist that the Irish bull is really "an 
example of abnormal, perhaps morbid, mental quick- 
ness." Mr. Henry W. Kerr, R.S.A., contributes six- 



teen colored plates, showing the Irishman rather more 
in accordance with the popular ideal of him than do 
the pages they illustrate. 

Two years ago the Goncourt prize for the best 
piece of imaginative writing of the year was awarded 
to M. Louis Pergaud for his animal stories, "De 
Goupil a Margot," published by the "Mercure de 
France." These stories, six in number and dealing 
chiefly with the tragic fate of as many wild creatures 
in their unequal encounters with their foes (usually of 
the human kind), are now retold by Mr. Douglas 
English in our own tongue, under the general title, 
"Tales of the Untamed," with illustrations by Mr. 
English. Adapter, not translator, he calls himself, 
urging that anything like literalness of rendering 
was found to be impossible. In his telling, the stories 
are full of a pathetic interest, and yet the pathos is 
never strained, the naturalness of it all never spoilt. 
The pictures, which seem to be photographs from 
nature, are as true to life as could be desired. Mr. 
English is already known for his "Photography 
for Naturalists" and also his "Book of Nimble 
Beasts." His new volume should find wide favor 
as a gift for the nature-lover. (Outing Publishing 
Co.) 

Philadelphia and its environs can boast of a 
greater number of historic colonial residences, still 
in a good state of preservation and most of them 
occupied by descendants of the original owners, than 
any other city in America. A stately quarto volume 
descriptive of these " Colonial Homes of Philadelphia 
and its Neighborhood " has been prepared by Mr. 
Harold Donaldson Eberlein and Mr. Horace Mather 
Lippincott, who have from infancy been familiar 
with many of the houses described. More than fifty 
of these early examples of domestic architecture 
have their history and associations narrated in the 
book, with a great number of accompanying views, 
exterior and interior, from photographs. Numerous 
other old houses of the city and its suburbs are men- 
tioned, but the limits of space have made it impos- 
sible to do more. Among the more famous of colonial 
homes met with in turning the book's pages are the 
Wister house, at Fourth and Locust streets ; Provost 
Smith's house, at Fourth and Arch streets, where 
Lowell and his bride were entertained in 1844 ; the 
Solitude, Fairmount Park, built by John Penn, 
grandson of William Penn ; James Logan's house, 
known as Stenton, at Germantown ; the Wayne 
homestead, Waynesborough ; and the houses asso- 
ciated with such old Philadelphia names as Willing, 
Wharton. Morris, Shippen, Brinton, Ashhurst, Pen- 
rose, Pennypacker, Shoemaker, and Wain. The 
book is printed from type, in a limited edition ; and 
with its many pleasing illustrations and artistic 
binding leaves little to be desired as an example of 
what is best in fine book-manufacture. It bears, 
appropriately, the imprint of the J. B. Lippincott 
Company. 

Mr. Walter Wood, believing that "it may well be 
chat we have reached a stage when all the nations 
must say 'Halt!' in connection with battleship con- 



1912.]

struction and naval expenditure," commemorates 
this epoch in naval history by preparing an histori- 
cal and descriptive account, from a British point of 
view, of " The Battleship " (Button ). From the first 
ship-of-the-line in Henry the Seventh's reign to the 
twentieth-century Dreadnaught, he traces the his- 
tory of battleship construction and the manners and 
customs of Jack Tar and his commanding officers, 
through four centuries of English naval development. 
Mr. Frank H. Mason, R.B.A., enlivens the narrative 
with eight striking illustrations in color, while many 
more pictures are supplied from old prints and mod- 
ern photographs. An original poem lamenting the 
fate of a splendid battleship insidiously done to death 
by a submarine is prefixed to his notable book by 
the author. Since, as Mr. Wood points out, "there 
is no book in our language which deals solely with 
the battleship, both sail and steam," his scholarly and 
handsome volume supplies a real want. Its pages, 
are alive with interesting facts, and its many illustra- 
tions are appropriate and helpful to an understand- 
ing of the subjects discussed. 

Those who enjoy gardening, and others also, will 
find pleasure in " The Four Gardens " (Lippincott), 
by " Handasyde," with colored illustrations and line 
drawings by Mr. Charles Robinson. The four gar- 
dens are the haunted garden, the old-fashioned 
garden, the poor man's garden, and the rich man's 
garden, all being such gardens as are to be seen in 
England and Scotland, and all redolent of odors 
familar to garden-lovers. The first-named of these 
gardens has a ghost, pictured in the frontispiece, 
and a very old stone wall ; also a children's corner, 
sheltered and sunny, where mint and sage grow 
against the old wall, and where the children do all 
the gardening with three tools shared in common 
and a shilling a year to each child for seeds. The 
gardening diary of one of the children contains an 
entry that may recall to the reader some of his own 
childhood likes and dislikes. " If all the garden 
belonged to me I would never plant potatoes." In 
the rich man's garden we see the owner, John 
Hardress, slowly pacing its broad paths and looking 
mostly at his boots, which are polished to perfection. 
Each of these gardens has its distinct character, and 
the artist has ably seconded the author in making 
that character appreciable to the reader. The book 
is beautifully printed and bound. 

Tributes to Lincoln are always in order. In a 
thin quarto of artistic design are brought together, 
under the general title, " Memories of President 
Lincoln," Walt Whitman's beautiful poems, 
" When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom 'd," "O 
Captain ! My Captain ! " " Hushed be the Camps 
To-day," and " This Dust was Once the Man," pre- 
ceded by the "Gettysburg Address," a preliminary 
word from Mr. William Marion Reedy, Mr. John 
Burroughs's comment on the Whitman monody, a 
preface by Mr. Horace Traubel, a few words from 
the publisher, Mr. Thomas B. Mosher, and a part 
of the Lincoln passage in Lowell's " Commemoration 
Ode." A short bibliography closes the book. The 



handmade paper, large print, broad margins, dec- 
orative initial letters, and other pleasing features of 
this tasteful volume are worthy of the publisher 
whose imprint it bears. An excellent and unhack- 
neyed portrait of Lincoln faces the title-page. 

Appropriate to the season is the reappearance in 
richly decorated form of Mr. Bouck White's thought- 
ful book treating of the life of Jesus and its special 
significance to the world of to-day. "The Call of 
the Carpenter" (Doubleday) opens with a prelimi- 
nary chapter calling attention to two facts which in 
the writer's opinion " occupy the centre of the stage, 
to which all other facts are tributary, and which for 
good or ill are conceded to be of superlative import. 
They are, the rise of democracy, and the decline of 
ecclesiasticism." But while the gap between the 
church and the people is widening, "this antagon- 
ism," asserts the author, "of the working class to the 
Church does not carry an antagonism also to Jesus. 
On the contrary, the Workingman of Nazareth prob- 
ably never stood higher in their esteem or more 
ardent in their affections." One might feel tempted 
to try to improve the form of this statement, but the 
general truth that the life of Jesus, rightly presented, 
never fails in its appeal, remains unassailable. Hence 
the value of such earnest and intelligent studies as 
Mr. White's. The book's outward beauty will help 
to increase its circulation. Its colored frontispiece 
is by Mr. Balfour Ker, its decorations by Mr. Frank 
Bittner. 

The annual catalogues issued by Mr. Thomas B. 
Mosher have for more than twenty years past held 
a peculiar place in the affections of book-lovers, not 
alone by reason of the appealing wares which they 
advertise or their own attractiveness of form, but 
also on account of the choice bits of literature scat- 
tered through their pages. These waifs and strays by 
many authors have now been brought together, with 
some revision and additions, in a delectable an- 
thology entitled " Amphora," of which Mr. Mosher 
is editor as well as publisher. The title is a happy 
one, for the little volume is indeed "a vase filled and 
over-flowing with wine of spiritual Life," a jar of 
precious essence distilled not from the famed public 
gardens of literature but from the shyer and more 
elusively fragrant blossoming of hedge and hillside. 
That little company to whom literature is a passion 
an affair of the heart more than of the head will 
not fail in gratitude to Mr. Mosher for this happy 
gift. It should find a place, perhaps the chief 
place, on the bedside shelf of every member of that 
company. 

The winning wiles and seductive smiles of Miss 
Kitty Cobb, who leaves her home in Pleasant Valley 
to see what the city of big hopes has in store 
for her, are pictured with pen and pencil by Mr. 
James Montgomery Flagg in thirty-one chapters, 
or scenes, filling a broad-paged quarto entitled ''The 
Adventures of Kitty Cobb" (Doran). They are 
collected in this permanent and attractive form 
after serial publication in certain papers, and form 
a picture-book calculated to amuse children of a

larger growth. Mr. Flagg's cartoons are not unlike 
Mr. Gibson's in their general manner, and are good 
examples of their species of art. The story part, 
under each drawing, is crisp and brief and very 
much to the point. Words and pictures fill the 
right-hand pages; smaller sketches of Kitty in vari- 
ous attitudes appear on the left. 

"A Book of Beggars" (Lippincott) contains six- 
teen large colored pictures, drawn by Mr. W. Dacres 
Adams, of various sorts of mendicants, a gipsy 
fortune-teller, a crossing-sweeper, two sisters of 
charity, a Salvation Army lassie and lad, a " suffra- 
gette," two charity-bazaar damsels, a well-nourished 
writer of begging letters, a sleek politician, and 
others. The old nursery rhyme beginning, " Hark, 
hark, the dogs do bark," introduces this company 
of beggars, and facing each picture is a more or less 
angry canine, sometimes two, while the front cover 
shows a ragged beggar subjected to the incivilities 
of a pair of unfriendly curs. The artist's meaning 
is in each instance unmistakably conveyed, and the 
pictures are bright and amusing. 

The mother as the home-maker and the central 
figure of the home life forms the subject of the late 
Margaret E. Sangster's thoughtful and sensible vol- 
ume, "The Mother Book" (McClurg). Thirty-fire 
chapters follow the mother's course and consider 
her problems from the first day of her married life 
onward to her old age, if indeed she allows herself 
ever to grow old. The male members of the house- 
hold, too, receive some attention, as in the chapter 
" About Husbands," in the one on " Bachelor Uncles 
and Spinster Aunts," and in the pages devoted to 
"The Boy and the Latch-key." Of course the ser- 
vant question is discussed, and the book abounds in 
good suggestions on that and many other domestic 
problems all set forth in Mrs. Sangster's well- 
known agreeable manner, and with a poem from her 
pen to close each chapter, beside apt selections here 
and there from other poets. The lavender binding 
of the book, its ornamental initial letters, its neat 
box, and other attractive features, help to commend 
it to the discerning seeker of gift-books. 

Animal stories told in negro dialect after the 
manner of Uncle Remus fill a well printed and 
cleverly illustrated volume entitled " Behind the 
Dark Pines " ( Appleton). The author, Miss Martha 
Young, opens her pages with a tribute to the old 
Mammy who used to delight her and other Southern 
children with such tales as her book contains. Fifty- 
five stories, full of amusing incident and sprinkled 
with snatches of verse, all in unmistakable darkey 
dialect, are told in the best manner of old Mammy. 
Mr. J. M. Conde"s numerous drawings show a lively 
appreciation of the comic element in these stories, 
and invite to a nearer acquaintance with the text. 

Recent revelations concerning the cause of the 
mutilation of the Venus of Melos and the original 
position of the missing arms make timely and wel- 
come a translation of M. Auguste Rodin's eloquent 
tribute to that masterpiece of sculpture. "Venus," 
or, as the sub-title reads, "To the Venus of Melos," 



is in its English dress the work of Miss Dorothy 
Dudley, and forms a booklet of twenty-six pages, two 
views of the famous statue being added, together 
with a portrait of M. Rodin drawn by Miss Gertrude 
Huebsch. A little less literalness of rendering 
would have been advisable on the translator's part. 
Otherwise the book is thoroughly pleasing. (B. W. 
Huebsch.) 

In the series of "The World's Romances," pub- 
lished in this country by Dana Estes & Co., there 
appear this year the ever-popular stories of "Sieg- 
fried and Kriemhild" and "Tristan and Iseult," 
told in simple and attractive manner, each within the 
compass of a hundred pages, and each illustrated 
with eight colored drawings in harmony with the 
manner and the period of the narrative. Mr. Frank 
C. Pape* illustrates the "Siegfried," Mr. Gilbert 
James the "Tristan." Covers and jackets are also 
brightly adorned with pictures. 

How a country boy, fresh from college, went to 
Chicago to seek his fortune, and just what sort of 
a fortune his search brought him, is told with no 
little cleverness of both pen and pencil by Mr. John 
T. McCutcheon, favorably known as cartoonist to 
the Chicago " Tribune," and deserving of still closer 
acquaintance through the pages of "Dawson, '11 
Fortune Hunter" (Dodd). The story, which is told 
no less by the pictures than by the text, runs off with 
a briskness of manner and a flow of ready invention 
that cannot fail to be enjoyed. The collegian just 
ready to conquer the great world could enjoyably 
and profitably devote a spare hour to Dawson's case 
before setting forth in quest of his own fortnne. 

Five inviting small holiday volumes of selections 
call each for a few words of commendation. " A 
Little of Everything " (Macmillan) presents titbits 
from Mr. E. V. Lucas's books, chosen and arranged 
by himself. Characteristic essays and sketches, with 
a number of poems from his books of verse, make up 
the volume, which conveys a good idea of Mr. Lucas 
in his happiest vein. Something novel in antholog- 
ical literature is offered by Miss Agnes Repplier in 
"The Cat: Being a Record of the Endearments 
and Invectives Lavished by Many Writers upon an 
Animal much Loved and much Abhorred " (Sturgis). 
The author of "The Fireside Sphinx" is well quali- 
fied to compile such a collection as this of entertain- 
ing prose and verse, and to preface it with an essay 
both learned in feline lore and pleasing to the cat- 
lover. The book, well illustrated by Miss Elizabeth 
F. Bonsall, extends to 1 73 pages, to the admiration 
of those who had not suspected how considerable is 
the volume of extant cat literature. A little book 
for the pocket is devoted to selections in prose and 
verse from those who have written in praise of gar- 
dens. "The Voice of the Garden " (Lane), as the 
book is called, is compiled by Mrs. Lucy Leffingwell 
Cable Bikle', and has a preface by Mr. George W. 
Cable. Under nine appropriate headings are grouped 
passages from a great number and variety of writers, 
ranging over English literature and even beyond it, 
but not presented to view in an alphabetical index, 



1912.]

as might have been wished. The book is tastefully 
bound in blue and gold. " Poems of Country Life " 
(Sturgis), compiled by Mr. George S. Bryan, is pub- 
lished as a welcome addition to " The Farmer's 
Practical Library." The most practical things are 
sometimes said to be the ideal ; hence the propriety 
of a book of poetry in a farmer's library. The 
selected pieces of verse, ranging from Herrick's 
" Harvest Home " to Ellsworth's " Shindig in the 
Country," all have the agreeable rustic tone and 
manner. They are grouped in seven divisions treat- 
ing of country folk, country tasks, country pleasures, 
country blessings, country fun, country scenes, and 
country ties. Well-known paintings of rural scenes 
are reproduced to illustrate the book. The table of 
contents has wisely been arranged in the form of 
an alphabetical author- index. "Sweet Songs of 
Many Voices " (Caldwell), compiled by Kate A. 
Wright (Mrs. Athelstan Mellersh), is a general col- 
lection of some of the best short poems of chiefly 
nineteenth-century English poets. A delicately 
ornamented binding and a colored frontispiece at- 
tract the eye. A useful closing index of first lines 
supplements the alphabetical author-index at the 
beginning. 

NOTES. 



"The Night-Riders," another of Mr. Ridgwell Cul- 
lum's exciting tales of western ranch life, will be pub- 
lished in February by Messrs. George W. Jacobs & Co. 

A timely publication just announced by Messrs. 
Duffield & Co. is " The Orient Question " by Prince 
Lazarovich-Hrebelianovich, a prominent Servian states- 
man. 

" The Authoritative Life of General William Booth," 
founder of the Salvation Army, has been written by his 
" first commissioner," Mr. G. S. Railton, and will be 
published in this country by Messrs. George H. Doran 
Co. 

" Roses of Psestum," by Mr. Edward McCurdy, is a 
volume of essays on Italy and the mediaeval spirit, 
charmingly written, and published by Mr. Thomas B. 
Mosher in the exquisite form that he knows how to give 
to a book. 

The forthcoming biography of George Frederic 
Watts, by his widow, to which we have once or twice 
referred in this column, will be published on this side 
by Messrs. George H. Doran Co. The work promises 
a rich literary and artistic treat. 

Three novels to be issued in February by Messrs. 
Little, Brown & Co. are the following: " The Day of 
Days," by Mr. Louis Joseph Vance; "The Maiden 
Manifest," by Delia Campbell MacLeod; and "On 
Board the Beattic," by Anna Chapin Ray. 

Mr. George M. Trevelyan has edited what seems to 
be a definitive edition of " The Poetical Works of George 
Meredith " in a single volume of six hundred pages, 
based on the carefully-revised text of the " Memorial " 
edition. The editor's notes give this work a special 
value. It is published by the Messrs. Scribner. 

It is reported that the recent death in London of 
William Flavelle Monypenny will not interfere with the 
completion of his important Life of Disraeli, the second 



volume of which has just appeared. Mr. Monypenny, 
it seems, had practically all the material for the work 
ready for the publishers at the time of his death. 

Professor Henry S. Cauby of Yale has prepared a vol- 
ume on "The Short Story," to be published immediately 
by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. The body of this book 
is a revision and enlargement of Professor Canby's 
previous monograph on the short story, the principles 
therein laid down being illustrated by a number of 
specimen stories. 

Beginning with its January issue the name of " Cur- 
rent Literature " will be changed to "Current Opinion," 
and the page-size will be increased from that of the ordi- 
nary magazine to seven by ten inches. We trust these 
innovations may help in widening the popularity of one 
of the few periodicals which may be regarded as indis- 
pensable to the intelligent reader. 

One of the most important books yet announced for 
publication in the new year is " The Mechanistic 
Conception of Life," by Professor Jacques Loeb, to be 
issued by the University of Chicago Press. The book 
has been written in such a manner that the layman may 
understand the work done by Professor Loeb and draw 
his own conclusions as to the importance of the fact that 
living creatures have been developed without the inter- 
position of the paternal element. 

A set of seven volumes, just received, completes the 
forty in which Miss Charlotte Porter has given us the 
"First Folio" Shakespeare (Crowell). In text and 
critical apparatus this edition leaves little to be desired, 
and it is matter for congratulation that Miss Porter's 
task of presenting the " trewe copy " has been so satis- 
factorily completed. Shakespeare is better worth read- 
ing in this form than in any modernized one, and in these 
days when even Chaucer is made easy by translation into 
current prose, it is well to be reminded that such shifts 
do a doubtful service to serious students of literature. 

A new publishing house has been established in Chi- 
cago by Mr. F. G. Browne, for many years head of the 
publishing interests of Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co., 
and a member of the directory of that corporation. Mr. 
Browne will have associated with him Mr. Frank L. 
Howell, and the firm name will be F. G. Browne & Co. 
The first book bearing the imprint of the new firm, an- 
nounced for publication in January, will be " The Lapse 
of Enoch Wentworth," by Isabel Gordon Curtis, author 
of " The Woman from Wolverton." Four other novels 
by popular authors are in preparation for issue during 
February and March. 

One of the best-known and best-loved of American 
clergymen has gone from us in the death of Dr. Robert 
Collyer in New York City on November 30. He was 
born in Yorkshire, England, in 1823, and came to this 
country at the age of twenty-seven, continuing to follow 
here the trade of blacksmithing which he had learned 
in the mother country. After a time he turned to the 
ministry, first as an itinerant Methodist preacher, then 
as an Unitarian missionary in Chicago. In 1860 he 
founded Unity Church in this city, continuing as its 
pastor for eighteen years. In 3 879 he was called to 
the Church of the Messiah in New York City, with 
which he was associated until his death. His published 
writings include the following: "Nature and Life," 
"The Life That Now Is," "The Simple Truth: A 
Home Book," "Talks to Young Men," "History of 
Ilkley in Yorkshire " (in collaboration), and " Things 
New and Old."

" Mr. Scott has provided the clearest, most readable 
and understandable book on the Panama Canal that I 
have yet seen. It tells just what we need to know 
and tells it interestingly. It will be a great help to 
anyone who wishes to know what Uncle Sam has done 
on the Isthmus, and every American should have the 
desire to know." BURTON HOLMES. 

"The best book on the canal that has so far ap- 
peared." Engineering News. 

"A complete history that is the best so far of its 
kind." Scranton (Pa.) Times. 

" The best history to date." Brooklyn Eagle. 

"The compactest history of the Isthmus and canal 
that we have seen." Hartford Courant.

predecessors." Panama Star and Herald.
