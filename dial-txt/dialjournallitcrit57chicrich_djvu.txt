These two large volumes recount the biographies of those seventy-nine Yale men who have rendered, 
in the judgment of the author, the most important contribution to American life. The selection embraces 
the biographies of such men as Jonathan Edwards, Nathan Hale, John C. Calhoun, Eli Whitney, James 
Kent, Samuel F. B. Morse, Noah Webster, James Dwight Dana, William M. Evarts, Fenimore Cooper, 
Theodore Dwight Woolsey, and William G. Sumner. 

The author emphasizes the story of the lives of these men with special reference to the factors of 
influence upon them as undergraduates. 

The records of the Yale Corporation, of the Faculty, of the Linonia and Brothers Debating Societies, 
and of many old-time student organizations, as well as diaries, letters, biographies, and histories, have been 
searched for the material employed. The books form a unique contribution to a little-worked field the 
influence of our historic universities on the men who have moulded the thought and life of the nation. 

Autograph letters of all the graduates memorialized have been printed from the originals in the 
author's collection, and the volumes are enriched by handsome photogravures.

BRAHMA'S CUP 

I lift the cup of Brahma high ! 
The cup and liquor both are his ; 

That flowing draught is perfect rest, 
For Brahma's self the liquor is. 

Let endless fyalpas still revolve, 

Who quaffs, no grief shall e'er befall, 

For he shall dream the dream of Cod, 
And never non> he dreams at all. 

M\) transmigrating days are o'er; 

Cod's hand presents the sacred cup; 
I eager grasp the chalice now. 

And drink i ne Godhead's liquor up. 

And while the sacred mine I quaff, 
Two souls are mingled on the brim; 

1 drink of Brahma in the cup, 
And he receives me into him. 



THIS edition includes, besides a few later poems, three separate 
books published at different times "Flowers of Song from 
Many Lands," a collection of poetic translations; "A Book of 
Quatrains," both original and translated (now revised and enlarged); 
and original verse which first appeared alone under the title of the 
present volume. 

Epigrams that snap crowd the pages; the quatrains might well 
serve as the text of many a longer discourse; and the descriptions are 
classically apt. The catholicity of the book is marked. From the 
very refinement of philosophy, ancient and modern, to the prayer of 
an Indian raider for scalps and the sacrificial hymn of the South Sea 
Island cannibals is a far cry, and the transition requires an unusual 
limberness of poetic fibre, yet each subject in its turn is given the 
form and atmosphere best suited to it. That rhythm and metre are 
beyond reproach needs no saying. 

The collection is a representative selection of a mature poet's work, 
covering a lifetime of emotions and the spirit of many centuries of 
philosophical wisdom.

From 

Nebula to Nebula 

or 

The Dynamics of the Heavens 

If at the equator a bullet were dropped from a height of 
ten miles, it would reach the spot on the Earth's surface 
vertically under It In about one minute. Short and straight 
though this fall might appear to us, the actual path of the 
bullet would be very long and tortuous, for during the same 
minute the alighting spot would be carried forward by the 
Earth's axial rotation some 17 miles, the Earth, because of 
her orbital motion, about 1,200 miles, and the System Itself 
about 800 miles. Of these motions contemporary science 
explains only the first, as being due to the gravitational 
attraction of the Earth. The rest It CONJECTURES to be 
"projectile." 

It occurred to the writer to Inquire whether the explana- 
tion given of the first motion might not in some way be 
extended to apply to all whether the Earth, the Sun and 
the System itself may not be FALLING, the same as the 
bullet and whether the principle of Universal Gravita- 
tion may not be the aU-sufflcient cause. Now, there Is no 
assignable reason, save the obsolete anthropocentrlc one, 
why our Solar System should be assumed to occupy the 
center of gravity of the Universe. If it does not do so, 
must It not then, by reason of being unsupported, be falling 
toward that center? The reasonableness of this view 
(which seems to have eluded Newton) being conceded, the 
author proceeds to show mathematically that the process 
of this mere "setting down" of our system to lower levels 
Is of Itself sufficient to explain dynamically all the rotary 
motions, axial as well as orbital, of the planets and their 
satellites, the commensurablllty of their periods and dis- 
tances, and their various phenomena of acceleration. 
Recurring again to our bullet, we may say with certainty 
that Its whole corkscrew journey of 2,000 miles In the space 
of the minute is solely one of gravitational fall.

So used are we to the conveniences of the modern 
residence that few of us have any conception of how 
astonishingly recent most of them are how late, 
for instance, came even such a development as the 
division of upper stones into rooms, except in South- 
ern Europe, and the more imposing edifices of north- 
ern nations. These developments are most inter- 
estingly depicted and the author's ideas as to future 
modes of living are piquant and sometimes a bit 
startling. The awful waste of present-day house- 
keeping and its remedy is a subject that will interest 
everyone.

GROCER-SHOP CRITICISM. 



The metaphor is a homely one, and lends 
itself readily to satirical comment, but Mr. 
Bliss Perry deliberately adopts it for the de- 
scription of the art of literary criticism, and 
what he says in its defence may be read in 
his essay on "Literary Criticism in American 
Periodicals," which occupies the plaee of 
honor in the July "Yale Review." "It 
surely ought to be possible," he says, to re- 
duce the varieties of criticism "to the terms 
of a single process, to conceive of criticism 
as the performance of a single act. I ven- 
ture to call it, as it has often, no doubt, been 
called before, the act of weighing." It is 
difficult to get away from this metaphor, 
which the author elaborates by describing the 
way in which a grocer weighs out a pound 
of butter, and the chorus of excited protests 
against the very idea of there being such 
things in criticism as standard weights, stand- 
ard scales, and competent literary grocers, 
cannot eradicate from our consciousness the 
deep-lying feeling that it is the business of 
criticism to estimate literature, to pass judg- 
ment upon it, to register the facts about it 
in some sort of objective fashion. That THE 
DIAL has upheld this view for upwards of 
thirty years is well known to our readers. 
Such foolish vaporings as were indulged in 
a few years ago by Mr. Joel Spingarn met 
with our vehement denial. When that icono- 
clastic gentleman asserted that "we have 
done" with all the old rules and methods, 
we replied, as Mr. Perry now replies, that 
' ' we have done nothing of the sort. ' ' We still 
practice and believe in the grocer's procedure, 
although fully aware that "there is some 
variation in the grocers' weights and in the 
mechanism of their scales; that there are 
garrulous grocers who talk when they should 
be weighing, philosophical grocers who have 
theories of their business, self-opinionated 
grocers who declare that they can tell a pound 
of butter by the eye or by the 'heft' as accu- 
rately as if they weighed it." 

When it comes to the question of whether 
the literary "weighing" in our periodicals is 
honestly or skilfully done, it is hard to arrive 
at an answer which is not darkly pessimistic.

THE DIAL 



[Julyl 



There is an appalling amount of it mostly 
the chatter of irresponsible young persons 
who are without the balance of fixed convic- 
tions, and without the background of that 
wide acquaintance with literature which is 
essential to any critic whose words are worth 
heeding. The trouble with most of this writ- 
ing is that the compensation offered for it 
is miserably inadequate for the reward of 
any kind of good work, while the public which 
it addresses has no real interest in literature. 
As Mr. Perry says: "The real difficulty is 
that these untrained and underpaid journal- 
ists are producing copy, as best they can, for 
a public which is genuinely interested in 
stock-market criticism, in base-ball criticism, 
in political, social, and economic criticism, 
and, in a few cities, in musical and dramatic 
criticism, but which is not very eagerly inter- 
ested in the criticism of books." But when, 
it may be asked, was it ever otherwise with 
the treatment of literature in the periodical 
press? Granted that the volume of chatter 
about books and about the personalities of 
the authors has become enormously swollen, 
are not the proportions of wheat and chaff, 
of bread and sack, about what they always 
were? Of the critical writing of any past 
age, we cherish the small fraction that has 
enduring value, because based upon knowl- 
edge and insight, while the great mass of 
ephemeral stuff has been winnowed away, and 
is now clean forgotten. 

Mr. Perry's thesis about the inadequacy of 
American criticism is based upon two texts 
one from Emerson, the other from Mr. Henry 
James. In 1836, Emerson wrote in his Jour- 
nal: "The literary man in this country has 
no critic." In 1905, Mr. James delivered a 
lecture in this country in which he said : 

" I do not propose for a moment to invite you 
to blink the fact that our huge Anglo-Saxon array 
of producers and readers and especially our 
vast cis- Atlantic multitude presents production 
uncontrolled, production untouched by criticism, 
unguided, unlighted, uninstructed, unashamed, on 
a scale that is really a new thing in the world. It 
is the complete reversal of any proportion, be- 
tween the elements, that was ever seen before. It 
is the biggest flock straying without shepherds, 
making its music without a sight of the classic 
crook, be-ribboned or other, without a sound of 
the sheep-dog's bark wholesome note, once in a 
way that has ever found room for pasture." 

Both of these quoted sayings are weighty, 
but is the case really as serious as they would 
seem to indicate? At the very time when 



Emerson made the entry in his Journal, one 
Edgar Allan Poe was subjecting current lit- 
erature to a criticism so informed and so 
penetrating that it has survived alongside of 
his immortal creative work in poetry and fic- 
tion. And Emerson himself, who, we are 
reminded, "lived long enough to see the first 
volumes of the Chicago DIAL," was writing 
book reviews that we may still read with 
profit, and that are preserved by virtue of 
their fine intelligence quite as much as by 
virtue of their Emersonian authorship. Since 
1836, we have had in Lowell and Stedman 
two really great critics, and many others that 
are more than respectable. On the whole, it 
does not seem to us that American literature 
is noticeably poorer in criticism of the finer 
sort than it is in any of the other categories 
which the convenient term of belles-lettres 
includes. 

It certainly is an unfair method of argu- 
ment to contrast, as Mr. Perry does, the im- 
mense volume of our book production with our 
slender output of serious criticism: "If you 
turn to the newspapers for information about 
the twelve or thirteen thousand books pub- 
lished in this country every year, you find, 
it is true, a heroically compiled mass of book 
notices many of them composed, in their 
essential features, by the advertising clerks 
of the publishers who are trying to sell the 
books." But do most of these books deserve 
any other treatment? Is not this condition 
a fair illustration of the principle of suum 
cuique applied to literature? Does not the 
occasional worthy book find, amid all this 
welter of "literary" scribbling, the worthy 
judge and the considered verdict? If the 
reader "has great difficulty in discovering 
what new books are worth buying and read- 
ing, " is he not in the case of the man who 
suffers from uncontrolled disease for lack of 
expert medical counsel, or of the man who is 
financially wronged for lack of the best legal 
advice? Among the practitioners of literary 
criticism taking the term in its most com- 
prehensive sense there are "quacks" or 
"shysters" in numbers quite as great as are 
to be found in the professions respectively 
suggested for comparison. But we do not, 
for all that, declare the professions of medi- 
cine and law to be pretentious failures, and 
there is no reason why we should discredit the 
whole profession of criticism because of the 
follies and ineptitudes committed in its name. 



1914 



THE DIAL, 



Mr. Perry is so obsessed with the flagrant 
immorality of the methods of advertising fre- 
quently employed by publishers that he finds 
the trail of the serpent the disguised read- 
ing notice and the puff unashamed in the 
columns that pretend to contain only disin- 
terested expressions of critical judgment. Un- 
doubtedly these columns are, in the case of 
many newspapers, thus prostituted to the 
service of the counting-room, and no con- 
demnation of the practice can be too severe. 
But the readers of a newspaper or magazine 
cannot long be deceived by this rank impos- 
ture, and soon learn to distinguish the honest 
from the dishonest publication. And no array 
of instances of this sort of confidence game 
can shake the solid fact that we produce in 
our country a large body of critical writing 
exhibiting both knowledge and discernment, 
the work of men of entire probity, not to be 
influenced by either sordid or personal con- 
siderations to stray into the ways of intellec- 
tual dishonesty. There may not be enough 
of it fully to leaven the whole lump, but there 
is enough of it to refute the man who, echoing 
Emerson, still asserts that "the literary man 
in this country has no critic." 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



THE FRIENDSHIPS OF THEODORE WATTS- 

DUNTON, whose death (June 7) goes far 
toward severing our vital connection with the 
great Victorians among whom he so naturally 
took his place, must have meant more to him 
than can be told in words, and must have con- 
tributed immeasurably to his growth and to 
the development of his art as poet, novelist, 
and critic. Beginning his young manhood as 
a solicitor in his father's office at St. Ives, in 
Huntingdonshire, and going afterward to 
London with his brother to gain a larger ex- 
perience in his hereditary profession, he was 
inevitably led by his literary and artistic 
tastes and his love of nature to abandon the 
law for the more seductive delights of lit- 
erature. Rambles in East Anglia and par- 
ticipation in the careless, nomadic life of the 
gypsies, helped to determine the bent of his 
genius and brought him into close friendship 
with Borrow and Groome, with whom he is 
ranked as one of the best interpreters of 
Romany customs and character. Other friends 
with whom he was intimate as a congenial 
companion were Tennyson and Browning; 
Whistler he saw almost daily for ten years, 
but one may question whether anybody could 



count on the eccentric artist for warm and 
unbroken friendship, year in and year out, 
through rain or shine, good fortune or ill; 
but the closest and most enduring of Watts- 
Dunton's friendships were with Rossetti, 
Morris, and Swinburne, and the greatness of 
these names, together with the indifference 
shown by the author of ' ' Aylwin ' ' in the mat- 
ter of collecting and making more easily ac- 
cessible the products of his pen, may partly 
account for the comparative obscurity in 
which his own name and work have been 
allowed to remain. 



SHAKESPEARE ON THE FRENCH STAGE re- 
ceives in some respects a more adequate and 
faithful presentation than in his own coun- 
try or America. The Parisians are having 
just now what they call a Shakespeare sea- 
son, two theatres offering Shakespeare plays 
simultaneously "Macbeth" at the Comedie 
Francaise, for the first time in the history of 
that famous playhouse, and "Twelfth Night" 
("La Nuit des Rois") at one of the theatres 
on the rive gauche and the versions there 
offered to the public are said to be much less 
cut and trimmed and adapted than are the 
stage versions commonly presented to an 
English-speaking audience. For instance, in 
the Richepin translation of "Macbeth," the 
one used on this occasion, the usually omitted 
second scene of act four, in which Lady Mac- 
duff's little boy prattles prettily with his 
mother and is put to death by one of the 
murderers, is retained by the actors; and, in 
general, there seems to be much less fear of 
wearying the audience by giving Shakespeare 
unabridged, untransposed, and untelescoped, 
than with us. Perhaps the French theatre 
trains time their departure with more regard 
to the convenience of their passengers; or is 
it that the Parisian audience is much less 
suburban in character than our own play- 
going public, and can afford to take its Shake- 
speare uncurtailed? It is reported in regard 
to the French performance of "Twelfth 
Night" that there is much less liberty taken 
with the comic parts, much less "business" 
interpolated, than when the play is given in 
the poet's own tongue. Must it be inferred 
that Shakespeare enjoys greater prophetic 
honors abroad than at home ?

esting to glance back at the history of old 
Holworthy Hall, which owes its existence to 
a successful lottery conducted in the year 
1806 under the authority of the General 
Court of Massachusetts, as the legislature of 
that State was and still is officially styled. 
That there was some belief, or some attempt 
to believe, that this method of raising funds 
for educational purposes was wholly right and 
proper, is evident from the following adver- 
tisement of the 1795 lottery, quoted by Mr. 
Benjamin Baker in a recent contribution to 
the Boston "Transcript," "So great is the 
demand for tickets in the 2d Class of Har- 
vard College Lottery, that it has become 
doubtful whether there will be any to dispose 
of, for several days previous to the 9th of 
April next, on which day the Lottery is posi- 
tively to commence drawing. The spirit 
which animated the first settlers of this coun- 
try to promote useful knowledge, has, if pos- 
sible, increased with the present generations; 
and this is the evidence, That there is scarcely 
a single one in the community, either male 
or female, who is not more or less interested 
in the College Lottery." This gem of uncon- 
scious humor is followed by an equally amus- 
ing bit of verse : 

" The lisping babe cries, Papa, care for me, 
Pray buy a TICKET and in time you'll see 
The pleasing benefit thy son will find, 
In Learning faithfully to serve mankind." 



DESECRATORS OF BOOKS, or, in especial, those 
who with more or less emphatic markings and 
underlinings undertake to instruct all subse- 
quent readers in the merits of certain chosen 
passages, are scathingly denounced by the 
Portland "Oregonian," which thus classifies 
the offenders: "The people who commit this 
offense fall into three classes: those who use 
ordinary pencils, those who use indelible pen- 
cils, and those who use ink. The first are 
worthy of the rock-pile, the second of the 
penitentiary, the third of the gallows." This 
is a nuisance from which the public library 
has always suffered and probably always will 
suffer in a world where human nature and 
pencils coexist. Nearly all libraries attempt 
to spot the offenders by asking borrowers to 
report any defacement or mutilation that they 
may discover, and by directing attendants to 
examine all books upon their return, thus 
making the latest borrower, unless he himself 
points out the evidence of misuse upon bring- 
ing back a book that has been misused, pre- 
sumptively guilty of any markings or other 
disfigurements that the book may be found to 
contain. But attendants have not the time, 
or will not take the time, as a rule, to give 



the necessary scrutiny to returned books ; and 
borrowers are equally negligent about con- 
cerning themselves with what they commonly 
regard as none of their business. We have 
heard of a library that adopted the practice 
of inserting in all books of its own binding or 
rebinding a few blank leaves bearing a printed 
request that they be used, rather than the 
body of the book, for purposes of annotation, 
illustration, or other voluntary contribution 
on the gifted reader's part; but how far the 
device served its purpose we cannot say. 



THE GENESIS OF "JAMES," a new novel that 
is enjoying no little popularity among English 
readers at present, contains features of inter- 
est to readers of whatever nationality. Its 
author, pseudonymously known as ""W. Dane 
Bank," is said to be on the sunny side of 
forty or thirty-eight, to be exact and to 
have started in life as an employee in a hat 
factory near Manchester; later he tried his 
hand at school-teaching, and finally took the 
road to London and became a free-lance in 
literature. "James" was written at odd 
hours, and pictures with a realism that be- 
tokens personal experience of that whereof it 
treats the fortunes of a young man who, like 
the author, has worked in a hat factory and 
aspired to greater things. But of course there 
can be nothing of an autobiographical charac- 
ter in the account of James's rather ignoble 
striving for worldly success, and in his ultimate 
triumph with his incomparable hair-restorer, 
"Superbo. " The kind of realism we have 
here seems to indicate that the author may be 
an admirer and more or less unconscious imi- 
tator of Mr. Arnold Bennett. But as to this 
we can pronounce more certainly after gain- 
ing a fuller acquaintance with "W. Dane 
Bank." The report that "James" suffered 
four rebuffs before achieving publicity sounds 
interesting and inclines one to suspect that 
the book may be something of a masterpiece, 
though the number of rejections is not quite 
large enough to turn the suspicion into a 
certainty. 



THOSE WHO READ THEIR GREEK IN THE 
ORIGINAL are commonly supposed, and not 
without reason, to be somewhat above the 
average reader in intellect and scholarship. 
Whether knowledge of Greek is a cause or a 
consequence of this superiority, or whether it 
may not, to some extent, be both, would be 
hard to prove. At any rate, one is interested 
in what Dean West, of Princeton, has to say 
on the supposed influence of Greek studies in 
securing for the student a high rank in gen- 



1914]

eral scholarship. At Princeton Greek is re- 
quired for the bachelor-of-arts degree, but not 
for that of bachelor of letters or bachelor of 
science. In the course of an article in the 
New York "Times," he writes: "The bach- 
elors of arts have maintained a clear lead 
over the others in all the humanistic subjects, 
such as philosophy, history, politics, eco- 
nomics, archaeology, Latin, English, and mod- 
ern languages. They have at least fairly tied 
and sometimes have led the others in mathe- 
matics, physics, and geology, and have not 
done so well in chemistry and biology, though 
in the advanced courses in chemistry they 
take the lead at the end. The bachelors of 
science come second, and in a few instances 
surpass the bachelors of arts. The bachelors 
of letters, as a rule, come third. Moreover, 
the bachelors of arts lead the others every 
year in the small percentage of 'dropped' 
students. These are cold, hard facts. It is 
the bachelors of arts alone who have a general 
and widely sustained lead in scholarship in 
Princeton during the six years in question 
(1907-1912). It is not a question of leaving 
out Latin for all the others have Latin, and 
in practically the same amount. It is clearly 
and solely the Greek question." Inconclusive 
though any reasoning must be from such in- 
sufficient premises as the foregoing, yet so far 
as they go these statements are significant 
and may help in some small measure toward a 
settlement of "the Greek question." 



THE POETIC WORTH OF THE RECENTLY DIS- 
COVERED SAPPHIC FRAGMENTS, in which the 
educated world was bound to take a lively 
interest, is not rated very high by Mr. 
Frank B. Sanborn in a recent "Boston Lit- 
erary Letter" to the Springfield "Republi- 
can. ' ' As MJp. Sanborn is almost alone among 
our men of letters in his practice of reading 
regularly, with ease and scholarly apprecia- 
tion, the classics that most of us dropped when 
we left college, weight attaches to the opinion 
he thus expresses : "I fear that these small 
fragments of the J3olic Greek of the all- 
admired Sappho may diminish rather than 
augment her poetic fame. So much of them 
is conjectural, and her diction is so hard to 
emend, that the quaintness of them will strike 
the modern ear more than their strictly poetic 
quality." Probably a certain predetermina- 
tion to discover excellence in any slightest 
fragment of Sappho that may be unearthed 
influences most critics in her favor, but Mr. 
Sanborn perhaps shows a disposition to err 
in the other direction when he dismisses 
Sappho in these words : ' ' For the instruction 
of after ages in astronomy, the new Greek 



text and translation of the manual of Aris- 
tarchus of Samos on ' The Sizes and Distances 
of the Sun and Moon,' prepared with great 
historical labor by Sir Thomas Heath, a for- 
mer fellow of English Cambridge, and pub- 
lished in 1913 at the Oxford Press, is really 
more important than the complete works of 
Sappho, if they could be found; but Sir 
Thomas could not make the world think so." 



IN AWE OF THE PRINTED WORD, the old-time 
bibliophile was likely, especially if he chanced 
to be a custodian of books, to cherish as little 
short of sacred every volume that once found 
lodgment on his shelves. In contrast to this 
we have what Mr. John Cotton Dana in the 
current issue of "Special Libraries" calls 
' ' the new library creed, ' ' concerning which he 
writes: "Select the best books, list them 
elaborately, save them forever was the sum 
of the librarians' creed of yesterday. To- 
morrow it must be, select a few of the best 
books and keep them, as before, but also, 
select from the vast flood of print the things 
your constituency will find helpful, make 
them available with a minimum of expense, 
and discard them, as soon as their usefulness 
is past." But such is still the librarian's awe 
for the printed word, or for that portion of 
it in his keeping, that the discarding process 
is as yet slow and timidly tentative; and the 
thought of adding printed matter of con- 
fessedly ephemeral value and for only tem- 
porary retention is naturally abhorrent to 
the conservative librarian. Mr. Dana admits 
that "the new library creed" has thus far 
been adopted by very few practising libra- 
rians. Its universal adoption, however, unless 
by some miracle the present flood of print be- 
comes greatly diminished in volume, is in- 
evitable in the near future. 



COMMUNICATIONS. 



THE 



EVERYMAN ENCYCLOPAEDIA 
ARTICLE ON CHICAGO. 



(To the Editor of the THE DIAL.) 
Included in that excellent series of publications 
known as " Everyman's Library " is a set of 
twelve volumes entitled " The Everyman Encyclo- 
pedia." It is disappointing to find in the article 
on " Chicago " a number of errors, a few of which 
I feel obliged to call attention to. The article in 
general seems to have been compiled from accounts 
and descriptions made twenty or more years ago, 
such as might be found in out-of-date gazetteers 
and cyclopaedias. 

In that part of the article enumerating some of 
the important buildings of the city there is a very 
inadequate account given of the representative 



10

structures as they exist to-day. Several of those 
included in the list given have within recent years 
been far surpassed in every respect by finer and 
greater structures, but none of those built within 
the last two decades receives any mention what- 
ever. One, at least, has been removed entirely. 
In the list is mentioned the " Board of Trade, a 
granite building, with a tower 300 feet in height," 
and though the building remains, the tower spoken 
of was removed a number of years ago. 

The twin structure, the City Hall and Court 
House, is said to have cost $4,000,000, and " close 
to it is the statue of Columbus." Both the build- 
ing and statue were removed five years ago and a 
new structure on the same site was completed in 
1911, costing $10,000,000. Among the great 
libraries no mention is made of the John Crerar 
Library, certainly belonging in the front rank of 
institutions of that character both as to endow- 
ment and number of volumes in its collection. 

The total area of the parks of Chicago is given 
at 2,000 acres, whereas there are more than 4,400 
acres included in the total area. No mention is 
made of the newer parks which have been created 
within the last twenty years, such as Marquette, 
McKinley, and Sherman Parks. ; " Lake Front 
Park " appears in the list given, though that name 
was changed to Grant Park many years ago. Mid- 
way Plaisance is said to have been the site of the 
World's Columbian Exposition in 1893; and while 
this is true in part, the fact is that Jackson Park 
was the site of far the most important of the 
Exposition structures. 

Among the institutions mentioned "Armour In- 
stitute" appears but not Lewis Institute, and 
" Hall House " is erroneously printed for Hull 
House. The Field Museum of Natural History is 
mentioned under its old name, long since dis- 
carded. The water supply, it is said, is " extremely 
good," which is quite true, but the writer adds 
that it is " owing to the construction of a tunnel 
four miles into Lake Michigan." As a matter of 
fact there are nine tunnels in existence, one of 
which, it is true, extends four miles into the lake, 
though none of the others exceed two miles in 
length. It is said that the " canal " (referring to 
the Drainage Canal) cost $33,000,000, though the 
cost to the taxpayers was about $75,000,000, and 
the end is not yet. 

Treating of the manufacturing carried on here 
the writer of the article says that " numbers of 
harvesting machines are made," which certainly 
seems an odd mode of expression, considering that 
one company alone turns out some 800,000 ma- 
chines of that kind annually in Chicago. In that 
part of the article referring to the grain trade it 
is said that the total reaches to " about 3,000,000 
bushels of corn, oats, and barley per annum." 
Whether the " total " refers to receipts or ship- 
ments, or both together, is not stated, but in any 
case the figures are grotesquely incorrect. The 
total grain receipts at Chicago for the year 1912 
were 322,000,000 bushels, and the shipments 244,- 
000,000, the difference being the quantity con- 
sumed or remaining in storage at the end of the 
year. There are later figures than those quoted 
here, as I am using only such information as was 



available to the writer of the article when it was 
published last year. 

In regard to the government of Chicago the 
article says that the mayor is elected for a term of 
two years, when the fact is the mayor's term is for 
four years and has been so since 1907. The popu- 
lation of the city is said to be " nearly 3,000,000," 
whereas by the last government census it was 
2,185,283, which hardly justifies the expression 
quoted. A little farther on, the population is 
formally given as 2,815,000, which it is readily 
seen is a transposition of the figures shown in 
the census, an unpardonable error in proof- 
reading. 

In the historical portion it is stated that Fort 
Dearborn was built in 1804, an error that at one 
time was a very prevalent one, but in later years 
it has been shown conclusively that the true date 
of this event was 1803. However, the " Encyclo- 
pedia Britannica" makes the same mistake, 
which is mentioned to show that writers of ency- 
clopaedias are very often careless when it comes 
to facts about Western history. In the bibliog- 
raphy the author of a certain valuable history of 
Chicago is given as "A. J. Andreas," a mistake for 
A. T. Andreas. 

It would have been a very easy matter to have 
avoided most or all of the errors above mentioned, 
as a few books of reference giving correct infor- 
mation on all these points were easily obtainable. 
It shows how easy it is to avoid one's responsi- 
bilities in such matters by sitting down with some 
old cyclopaedia article and rewriting or con- 
densing it without any attempt to revise or bring 
the information down to date. Taking liberties 
with articles of this kind is a common fault with 
writers of cyclopaedias and works of similar char- 
acter, especially those on subjects pertaining to the 
newer regions of the West. Writers and editors 
of such works exercise much more caution when 
the older cities and localities of the country are 
under treatment, for it is well known that negligent 
and loose writing in regard to them will meet with 
much more prompt criticism than our busy people 
take the trouble to notice. Such an article as this 
about Chicago, with as many errors contained in it 
as are found there, would raise a storm of protest 
from the large body of readers found in almost 
any of our older cities and communities; but it is 
taken for granted that the easy way will answer 
for our more modern city, where, it is perhaps 
correctly surmised, the few readers who do peruse 
the articles cannot find time in the mad rush of 
everyday life to pause a moment and demand cor- 
rections in the interest of accuracy.

Mexicans, don't know what they want; they are 
inarticulate ; we know, and we inform the world ! 

In spite of all this, may I having lived in 
Mexico, keeping house, circulating among all 
classes and especially among peons may I sug- 
gest that your reviewer, in discussing certain books 
bearing on Mexico, fell into the very common error 
of reading into the Mexican people aspirations 
and ideas totally foreign to that very amiable and 
immature race? 

The population of Mexico consists of some four- 
teen millions. Of these some two million are 
whites, chiefly Spanish, and the remainder, some 
twelve million, consists of Indian stock; Aztec, 
Toltec, Maya, Zapotec, etc. A psychological 
anthropologist (or whatever the proper title may 
be) would probably call them morons physically 
adults, mentally children. In that respect they are 
much like our negroes before the war. 

Now, it is a matter of history that many of our 
good people half a century ago assumed that the 
negro had high and lofty aspirations for constitu- 
tional government and political freedom. In due 
time things shaped themselves so that the negro 
had an opportunity to demonstrate to the world 
just exactly what his " aspirations " were, just 
what concrete form these longings for freedom, 
etc., took. As we look back now at the shameless 
tale of graft, boodle, corruption, blindness to 
public duty, and wholesale inefficiency, we wonder 
how the experiment ever came to be tried. 

The reason is simple: we persisted in reading 
into negro character aspirations and ideals totally 
foreign to it utterly incomprehensible to them. 
And at the present day, undeterred and unen- 
lightened by the patent teachings of history, a 
large part of the American people still persists 
in the error of assuming aspirations and ideals 
among a people unable to read and write of which 
they have not the slightest inkling. 

American and other foreign observers unite in 
limiting the aspirations of the average peon of 
Mexico to such simple things as a sufficiency of 
frejoles, tortillas and pan dulce to eat; a suit of 
cotton clothes and the inevitable frazada to wear, 
an adobe shanty with a few sticks of furniture 
to live in ; an occasional bullfight or shady comedy 
to witness; and vague unlimited aspirations for 
mescal, gambling, cockfighting, robbery, and mur- 
der when drunk. He not only has no aspiration 
for representative government, just and impartial 
judiciary, civil service reform, and community 
altruism, but the very terms are meaningless to 
him. The peon is four-fifths of the Mexican 
people. E. L. C. MORSE.

"WHAT CHILDREN SHOULD KNOW." 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
The editorial on "What Children Should Know," 
in the last issue of THE DIAL, offers food for re- 
flection. You are right, I think, in placing upon 
the parents much of the blame for the ignorance 
of the coming generation. We depend upon the 
school to supply our children with culture, and we 
blame the school if the child does not respond and 



become educated. Doubtless the school is often at 
fault, but it cannot do everything. It can teach 
the lore of books, which it too often does by a 
cramming process, but after all the child will gain 
in the home, if at all, that broader knowledge of 
affairs and that outlook on life which constitutes 
culture as distinct from book-learning. Now, how 
much are the average parents of to-day doing at 
home to open the way for this culture? What is 
the usual conversation at the family dinner table? 
College-bred parents, who can talk intelligently 
and interestingly on literature or science or topics 
of current interest, and who do so at their clubs, 
spend the dinner hour at home in discussing the 
burning question of when the calciminer shall tint 
the parlor ceiling, or' how the Joneses happened to 
get that outlandish green auto, or perhaps they eat 
in preoccupied silence and let the children chatter 
about anything or nothing. Is it any wonder that 
children in such homes are not vitally interested 
in the subjects that are given to them at school, or 
that they fail somehow to acquire an all-round 
education ? 

You have referred to the ignorance of the mod- 
ern child regarding the literature of the Bible. I 
had occasion a few months ago to place two Bible 
stories in the hands of a class of third-grade pupils 
in one of the large public schools, as a test. Only 
three children out of a membership of fifty-two 
had heard the story of Moses. A majority had 
heard in Sunday-school about Joseph, but many 
were very hazy concerning him. Has the reading 
of the Scriptures at home been entirely abandoned 
in these latter days, and is the change of attitude 
toward them responsible for the condition just 



noted ?

IN THE HEART or THE DARK COXTIXEXT.* 



Of late years the wilds of Africa have had 
no lack of visits from eminent explorers, 
hunters, geographers, ethnologists, anthropolo- 
gists, zoologists, botanists, and other seekers 
after things new and strange and interesting 
in the little-known interior of the Dark Con- 
tinent. The fruits of one of the most notable 
of these expeditions are offered, so far as they 
can be offered in a book, in the two handsome 
volumes describing the operations of the Ger- 
man exploring party headed by the Duke of 
Mecklenburg in 1910-1911, being the second 
African expedition conducted by this intrepid 
explorer. But although his name appears on 
the title-page as sole author, not more than 
one-seventh of the book is from his pen, the 
remaining six-sevenths being the work of five 
other members of the party, who were engaged 
in subsidiary expeditions aside from the main 
route. 

"From the Congo to the Niger and the 
Nile" designates in a general way the pur- 
pose and character of this central-African 
exploring enterprise, in which its leader con- 
fined his activities chiefly to the regions of the 
Middle-Congo, Ubangi, Lake Tchad, and the 
Binue (or Benue) and Niger rivers, while his 
aids pushed their several ways eastward to 
the White Nile and up to its confluence with 
the Blue Nile, through the German Congo and 
South Cameroons, and to the islands of Fer- 
nando Po and Annobon. The purpose of all 
these trips was, of course, to obtain geograph- 
ical, ethnological, anthropological, zoological, 
botanical, and other useful information, and 
to' collect specimens of animal and plant life 
in- other words, to enlarge the bounds of 
human knowledge as to this little-travelled 
section of the globe, in which a considerable 
extent of recently-acquired German territory 
beckoned alluringly to German explorers and 
scientists. 

Evidences of improved conditions in the 
Belgian Congo were noted by the explorers, 
though not all the changes observed by them 
were fully approved. We read, for example 
in the opening chapter : 

" In Boma we noticed several alterations and 
improvements. The sleeping sickness, which still 
ravages a great part of the interior of Africa, has 
necessitated the extension of the splendid hospital, 
and the large palace of the Governor is soon to be 
replaced by a new building ih the modern European

style. Everyone sings the praises of King Albert 
of Belgium, who has not only generously renounced 
his very considerable private revenues from the 
Congo, but has himself contributed large sums of 
money towards the introduction of modern appli- 
ances, and towards combatting the sleeping sick- 
ness. 

" It will be time enough to discuss the promised 
Congo reforms together with their influence on 
international trade, which is so closely bound up 
in them, when they have become an accomplished 
fact and this is still a long way off. 

" Now, at any rate, contrary to the assertions of 
biased newspapers, the natives enjoy considerate 
treatment, not only here, but in many other parts 
of the West Coast, a treatment regarded with grave 
anxiety by such as really understand negro psy- 
chology. The manner in which justice is admin- 
istered in some of the chief West African towns, 
in many cases positively favouring the negroes to 
an incredible degree, seriously resembles an unac- 
countable panic. Such obvious anxiety not to 
offend so-called ' influential ' individuals must in 
the long run have injurious results. For natives 
are quick to recognize timidity, and to take advan- 
tage of it. I could mention several examples bear- 
ing out this statement only too well. Every 
traveller should consider it his duty to call attention 
to the need of just but stern government." 

The writer regards the economic develop- 
ment of the Congo as "seriously endangered 
by the new regulations regarding the treat- 
ment of the natives." It is reported, though 
we need not necessarily be alarmed by the 
statement, that the profits from rubber-pro- 
duction have of late materially diminished. 
As the government no longer uses force in 
collecting the rubber by native industry, the 
large collecting stations have become useless. 
Plantations now offer the sole means of obtain- 
ing rubber, but even here there are serious 
obstacles in the regulations forbidding the 
employment of unwilling native laborers, so 
that the early abandonment of these planta- 
tions seems unavoidable. Better that, how- 
ever, than the perpetuation of a barbarous 
system of peonage or negro slavery. 

In contrast to that "just but stern govern- 
ment" advocated by the traveller familiar 
with German methods of administration, na- 
tive African systems of government and of 
judicial procedure are certainly feeble and in- 
effectual. In the Mandja country "the chiefs 
have absolutely no authority over their sub- 
jects, the government being highly demo- 
cratic. A chief cannot punish any of his 
subjects, and has no means of enforcing obe- 
dience." In the detection of crime, trials by 
fire or poison are customary. A suspected 
thief is made to hold his hand in the fire, and 
if it burns him he is declared guilty; or he 
may be forced to drink poison, and if he dies 
of it his guilt is proved, but if he survives he

is innocent. Among the Niellims there is a 
bee-hive test that serves the same purpose as 
the ordeal by fire or poison. The accused is 
compelled to thrust his hand into a bee-hive, 
and if the bees resent the intrusion in their 
usual manner the suspected one is pronounced 
guilty, a contrary result causing a correspond- 
ing verdict. But the court is commonly won 
over by unfair means by the plaintiff; that 
is, the bees are irritated beforehand, and hence 
an acquittal is all but unknown. 

German criticism of rules and regulations 
in districts controlled by the French is not 
unnaturally to be found in the book. For 
example, in the Duke of Mecklenburg's ac- 
count of his explorations about Lake Tchad 
we read : 

" The daily loading of the animals was indeed a 
sore trial of our patience. Each ox carries his 
driver and a load suspended on each side, which 
must be very carefully balanced to prevent the 
heavier load from dragging down the lighter. This 
was an almost daily occurrence, so that we became 
quite accustomed to hear the crash of falling pack- 
ing-cases, although this did not exactly improve 
their contents. The preparations for starting 
always occupied at least an hour and a half, 
whereas well-drilled carriers get ready to march in 
less than half an hour. The animals soon tired and 
fell on the bad roads, which resembled nothing so 
much as a frozen and newly ploughed field. The 
overhanging branches, too, pulled down the loads, 
and thus necessitated halts of varying duration 
which were very tiresome. However, French 'hu- 
manity ' forbids the employment of native carriers 
in all districts where they can be replaced by 
animals. Perhaps the happy day will yet dawn 
in Europe when all manual labour will be for- 
bidden for humanitarian reasons!" 

Sharper point is given to this ironical com- 
ment on French "humanity" by the thought- 
less cruelty of the native drivers toward their 
beasts of burden. But in general we sympa- 
thize with the negroes in their decided pref- 
erence for following their own pursuits rather 
than being coerced into the wearisome office 
of carrier. 

Among the more interesting discoveries 
of these explorers may be noted the stone 
hatchets and hammers found in Bagirmi and 
regarded as "traces of a far-distant age," 
and also the "eatable earth" of the same re- 
gion a natural product looked upon by the 
natives as a great delicacy when made into a 
kind of pudding sauce. Here, evidently, is 
the paradise of which our own clay-eaters 
dream. Further eastward, in Bahr-el-Ghazal, 
there was encountered what might almost be 
regarded as the long-looked-for missing link; 
in fact, several links made their appearance, 
as described by Captain von Wiese und Kais- 
erswaldau. Recording his meeting with a 



venerable old man named Bogpingi, he says 
that the patriarch related with great pride the 
history of his origin, which is as follows : 

" His great-grandfather, Rumbi, had once upon 
a time lost his way in the great Congo forest, and 
had lived by himself until he made friends with 
a herd of chimpanzees. He made his home with 
this herd, and eventually married a chimpanzee 
young lady. By this union he had several children, 
amongst them Bansira, who was afterwards Bog- 
pingi's grandfather. Bansira was finally adopted 
by the Pambias, and his family has remained with 
this tribe ever since ; his son was the chief Gimma, 
the father of my informant Bogpingi. The old 
gentleman was very proud of having had a chim- 
panzee for his great-grandmother, and his face 
certainly confirmed his account of his ancestry, 
bearing an unmistakable resemblance to my two 
tame chimpanzees. Several times in this country 
I came across families claiming a direct descent 
from anthropoid apes, which they regarded as a 
special honour, and by no means as a disgrace!" 

One further notable passage must be given, 
this time from Dr. Arnold Schultze's travels 
in the German Congo and South Cameroons, 
as related by him in the second volume. Near 
the village of Lau, between Yukaduma and 
Assobam, he was visited by a chieftain who 
gave interesting information concerning the 
widely-scattered secret society called "Labi." 

" The most astonishing thing connected with this 
society is its secret language, understood by all 
members, and constituting a bond of union between 
natives belonging to the most diverse and often 
hostile tribes. A Labi member may not kill his 
antagonist in battle after the latter has proclaimed 
his membership by means of a few code words. 
Duku, a soldier who accompanied me, belonged to 
this society, and confirmed the statements of the 
Lau chief, adding that its members are found 
among the Yangheres, Bokaris, Bipalos, and Kakas, 
as well as among the Makas and Yebekolles." 

No lack of unusual and often exceedingly 
interesting information is to be found in these 
generous volumes. The colored illustrations 
and uncolored drawings furnished by the 
artist of the expedition, Herr Ernst M. Heims, 
are excellent ; and his pen contributes a nota* 
ble section, "From Lake Tchad to the Niger." 
Pictures from photographs abound through- 
out the work, and a good map is inserted at 
the end. The translation, commendable espe- 
cially for its successful avoidance of the tone 
of a translation, is from an unnamed hand 
or hands. Some evidences of haste in the 
preparation and proof-reading and printing 
of the book are discoverable, as is commonly 
to be expected in a work issued simultaneously 
in several languages; but the substantial 
worth of this contribution to our knowledge 
of equatorial Africa is not thereby impaired.

Ax EXGUSH MODERNIST.* 



" Modernism" is a word which only re- 
cently has been found frequenting good society 
with a specific, not to say a technical, mean- 
ing. It would be a moderately good definition 
to say that Mr. G. K. Chesterton is a Modern- 
ist; but still only moderately good, for so 
many Modernists are not what Mr. Chesterton 
is. It may be better, then, to quote Professor 
Santayana, from his breezy "Winds of Doc- 
trine": "Modernism is the infiltration into 
minds that begin by being Catholic and wish 
to remain so of two contemporary influences: 
one the rationalistic study of the Bible and 
of church history, the other modern philos- 
ophy, especially in its mystical and idealistic 
forms." A little further on he says in his 
brilliant and slightly unfair way : ' ' The mod- 
ernist, then, starts with the orthodox but 
untenable persuasion that Catholicism com- 
prehends all that is good; he adds the 
heterodox though amiable sentiment that any 
well-meaning ambition of the mind, any illu- 
mination, any science, must be good, and 
therefore compatible with Catholicism." 

On reading the first half of Mr. Wilfrid 
Ward's "Men and Matters" one might not 
feel the application of the foregoing remarks, 
for though the papers on George Wyndham 
and John Stuart Mill and "Mr. Chesterton 
among the Prophets" all reveal the Catholic 
point of view, that view is truly Catholic, 
undisturbed by any hint of schism, modernist 
or medievalist ; while the two delightful 
papers on Disraeli might have been written 
by a Jew. 

It is in the second half of the volume that 
the Modernism of Mr. Ward develops. Begin- 
ning auspiciously with an essay on Cardinal 
Vaughan, the unity is broken briefly by 
' ' Tennyson at Freshwater. ' ' Then the burden 
is renewed, and grows in volume and dis- 
tinctness to the end. The titles alone are elo- 
quent: "Cardinal Newman's Sensitiveness," 
"Union among Christians," "The Conserva- 
tive Genius of the Church," "St. Thomas 
Aquinas and the Mediaeval Thought," "Car- 
dinal Newman on Constructive Religious 
Thought," "Reduced Christianity," and 
"Papers Read before the Synthetic Society." 
Although there is a formidable ecclesiastical 
sound to these titles, and indeed not a little 
ecclesiastical material under them, yet the 
writer's sound historical knowledge and mel- 
low personality, joined with his completely 
flexible and dignified handling, give them all 
an interest even to the general reader. 

The groundwork of assumptions in a con-

sistent Catholic book can scarcely be scientific 
in a modern sense. That is, the deductive 
Aristotelian interpretations made by Thomas 
Aquinas in the thirteenth century have never 
been brought into harmony with the empir- 
ical methods of the twentieth century (and 
therein lies the problem of the Modernist). 
Science is always heretical and protestant, 
whatever the bias of the scientist may be. 
Therefore when a scientific person and a non- 
Catholic to boot reads in Mr. Ward's Preface 
that "the crude theory of 'private judgment' 
finds few advocates" and that "heresies are 
of course a danger to the Church, ' ' the audac- 
ity of this cool conservatism is more startling 
to him than the last outburst of the highest 
German criticism can be to the innocent lit- 
eralist. But it will also be extremely salutary 
for that same non-Catholic to get the view- 
point of Modernism, not from a priest, but 
from a Catholic philosopher and man of the 
world. 

The chapter on "Union among Christians" 
turns a frank face to the great schism in the 
Christian Church. Why are not Catholics as 
ready as Protestants to cooperate against the 
common foes of atheism and free thought? 
Mr. Ward's answer is so important as to de- 
serve full quotation : 

" What then is the true import and rationale 
of the exclusiveness of Catholics? of their slow- 
ness to amalgamate with other Christians? Why, 
if they wish to cooperate with others against the 
common enemy are they not more ready than they 
actually are to put out of sight points of differ- 
ence, to join in common worship, to send their 
children to schools in which the essence of Chris- 
tianity is taught, though not the distinctively 
Catholic doctrines? Why do they seem so slow to 
recognize that in the great battle for Christian 
faith, forms of the creed are minor matters com- 
pared with its essence? The reply may be put in 
various ways. The one which I think best appeals 
to the modern mind is the view which is illustrated 
in Cardinal Newman's Essay on Development, by 
his comparison of the Catholic Church to an 
organism. An organism has many parts perform- 
ing various functions which cannot be regarded as 
equally important elements in its life-work. Yet 
its power to do its life-work effectively depends 
on the whole being kept alive and vigorous. And 
for this object functions not directly connected 
with its most important work are indispensable. 
Cicero's digestive functions are certainly a very 
minor matter in our thought of Cicero as a world- 
power. Yet they may have played an all-important 
part in the general well-being without which he 
would not have left us the writings by which his 
greatness was established. The Catholic Church 
no doubt claims to be the one indefectible guardian 
of the Christian revelation. Her exclusiveness is 
largely based on this claim. But it has also much 
of its raison d'etre in reasons which are the condi- 
tions of efficiency for any organism. Her creed 



1914]

15 



and ritual and organization form a complete and 
living whole. Once you begin to tamper with it 
and to suggest that only those parts of her creed 
should be insisted on which she shares with other 
Christians, you threaten the validity of the living 
organism and the individuality on which its power 
largely depends." 

This would be fine were it not for a defect 
in the analogy of Cicero's "digestive func- 
tions. ' ' Modern history takes very important 
account of Cicero's digestion. We are dog- 
matically certain that life depends to an exces- 
sive degree "upon the liver," that the deepest 
tragedies (such as Hamlet's) have all a phy- 
siological basis. So it is not quite modern to 
assume that the liver is only obscurely in our 
minds. Furthermore, is there not a sugges- 
tion of casuistry in the comparison of ritual 
with such an important part of Cicero ? Cic- 
ero 's baldness or the cut of his toga really 
had no effect, according to the best informa- 
tion available, on his influence as a world- 
power. 

Another passage to the same point seems 
much more convincing. Speaking of one of 
the distinctively Catholic ideals, the monastic 
life, as a point at issue for Protestants, espe- 
cially for Mr. Kingsley, Mr. Ward writes : 

" Probably far more will be done to check infi- 
delity by the zeal and esprit de corps of even one 
among the hundreds of Catholic religious orders 
than by all that the religion in common between 
Mr. Kingsley and the Pope would be likely to 
effect not because the points in common between 
them are not the most important ones, but because 
in the monastic vocation you have the inspiration 
and the faith that can move mountains, while Mr. 
Kingsley and the Pope are not likely to combine 
so as to create any parallel esprit de corps or self- 
denying zeal in their followers. Zeal is needed 
as well as truth, heat as well as light. Nothing 
is more important than belief in God. Yet a mis- 
cellaneous collection of theists would probably be 
comparatively lukewarm and ineffective apostles." 

Herein lies the only effective justification of 
denominations. Speaking in terms of formal 
logic, as you increase the extension of a term 
or thing you decrease the intention, until 
finally the meaning grows so thin that it is 
nothing but skin and bone with not a drop of 
blood to give it force. 

The gist of Modernism is contained in the 
two papers, "The Conservative Genius of the 
Church" and "St. Thomas Aquinas and Me- 
diaeval Thought. ' ' The conservative principle 
of the Church has resulted in the continuous 
double phenomenon of Resistance and Assimi- 
lation. "The palmary instance of this as- 
similative activity because the change was 
greatest was the complete adaptation of the- 
ology to Aristotelian philosophy and to dia- 
lectical treatment by St. Thomas Aquinas." 



Aristotle's metaphysical works, condemned by 
the Council of Paris in 1210 A. D. to be burnt, 
were "sifted" by Albertus Magnus and trans- 
formed by St. Thomas, until in 1254 they 
were in the official required list for the Bach- 
elor of Arts degree. This lesson from Aquinas, 
Mr. Ward would have the modern Church 
learn. He says the temper of mind of the 
twelfth and thirteenth centuries was much 
like this of the twentieth. The material of the 
intellectual questioning was different ; but the 
method, the precocious curiosity, was the same. 
Therefore in dealing to-day with secular learn- 
ing the Christian theologians "have every- 
thing to learn from St. Thomas." 

It appears later in this essay that what St. 
Thomas did was to join the philosophy of 
Plato to the method of Aristotle, and Mr. 
Ward's immense though natural mistake is 
that Christian theologians have still only 
Plato and Aristotle to reckon with. Mr. Ward 
knows something of later philosophies, of 
Pragmatism for instance, but he brushes this 
last aside as out of court. Such a magisterial 
manner with this potent element in our Zeit- 
geist argues only fear of the opposition or 
distrust of his own forces, or both. The 
"Summa Theologica," however keen and 
effective a weapon in the thirteenth century, 
needs more than a simple readjustment; it 
must have a new handle and some new blades. 

The essays that are without ecclesiastical 
tang are delightful. That on Disraeli flashes 
light upon so many facets of this sparkling 
person that the confluence takes on unity and 
historic truth. The treatment of John Stuart 
Mill is as fine a piece of critical writing upon 
a difficult and not over-engaging subject as 
can be found in contemporary literature. It 
is worthy of the early reviewers, of the hand 
of a Macaulay or the heart of a Carlyle. 

"Tennyson at Freshwater," though a 
charming piece of literary chat, curiously 
misses the mark of its author. Mr. Ward as 
a boy had known and worshipped Tennyson, 
and in recounting some homely incidents 
concerning the "god of his idolatry" he dan- 
gerously assumes that his readers will inter- 
pret them as sympathetically as he himself 
does. For instance, Jowett's remark, "Ten- 
nyson experienced a great deal of pain from 
the attacks of his enemies ; I never remember 
his receiving the least pleasure from the 
commendation of his friends, ' ' quoted approv- 
ingly, may not be considered altogether con- 
clusive as to Tennyson's imperviousness to 
flattery, but rather bears witness to a gluttony 
that no surfeit could satisfy. And Mr. Ward's 
concluding anecdote has such a doubtful twist 
as to leave one almost suspicious of his alle- 
giance :

THE SUSPECTED SHAKESPEARE 
PLAY-LISTS.* 



In 1842 Peter Cunningham, clerk in the 
audit office, Somerset House, announced that 
he had discovered the original manuscript ac- 
counts of the expenses incurred by the Master 
of the Revels, Edmund Tylney, for the dra- 
matic entertainment of King James. The 
"find" consisted of three folio sheets folded 
into six leaves, twelve pages, which were held 
together by a thread. In this pamphlet three 
pages are devoted to an enumeration of plays 
presented before the king at Whitehall in 
the winter of 1604-5 and 1611-12, among 
Avhich are included some of Shakespeare's 
plays, with the dates of their production and 
the name of "the poet wch mayd the plaies 
Shaxberd. ' ' These lists are of the utmost im- 
portance to Shakespeare scholars, for they 
throw light on the hotly debated questions of 
the date of composition of some of the poet's 
greatest works, such as "The Tempest," 
"Othello," "A Winter's Tale," and "Meas- 
ure for Measure." Twenty-six years after 
Cunningham's startling discovery, the forgot- 
ten pamphlet was offered for sale to the Brit- 
ish Museum by a book dealer. Sir F. Madden 
investigated the matter and, finding that the 
papers were public property, retained them 
in the name of the government. After a 
cursory examination, the pages which mention 
Shaxberd 's plays were unhesitatingly de- 
clared to be "a gross forgery." Mr. Bond, 
Assistant Keeper of Manuscripts, Mr. Hardy, 
of the Rolls Court, and all Shakespearean 
editors and scholars, so regarded them. Speak- 
ing of pages 3 and 4 of the 1604-5 list, Mr. 
Halliwell declared that the character of the 
ink alone warranted the suspicion that the 
forgery was perpetrated after 1812. One of 
the reasons for this statement was the fact 
that in 1880 he had discovered among the 
Malone MSS. in the Bodleian Library a

Law, B.A. New York: The Macmillan Co. 



memorandum, not in Malone 's handwriting, 
which agrees with the suspected play-list in 
almost every detail, even as to the peculiari- 
ties of spelling. If the play-list was founded 
on the Malone memorandum it must have been 
made after 1812, the year of Malone 's death. 
Recently it occurred to Mr. Ernest Law to 
examine the condemned papers, and he came 
to the conclusion that the adverse judgment 
of his predecessors had been too hastily 
reached and that the questioned accounts were 
genuine. Professor Wallace, Sir George War- 
ner, and others, examined the papers at Mr. 
Law's request and confirmed his conclusions; 
whereupon he published the results of his 
investigation in 1911 in a very readable and 
interesting booklet entitled, "Some Supposed 
Shakespeare Forgeries. ' ' As might have been 
anticipated, the little book and its facsimiles 
attracted the attention of students of Eliza- 
bethan literature the world over, and its con- 
clusions met with general acceptance. There 
was one writer, however, who was not con- 
vinced, and who, in the pages of "The Athe- 
naeum," attacked the questioned documents 
with great vigor and much learning, even if 
not with that scientific accuracy that such 
an inquiry demands. The little book now 
before us, "More about Shakespeare 'Forg- 
eries,'" embodies Mr. Law's reply to his 
anonymous critic; and it must be admitted 
that he scores neatly, fairly, and convincingly 
with regard to most of the points made 
against the Accounts. And yet the present 
reviewer is not convinced. The historic and 
literary evidence of the genuineness of the 
1604-5 and 1611-12 lists is not such as not to 
leave room for doubt. A question of this 
kind can be settled in only one way, by a 
properly conducted scientific investigation of 
the MS. by a professional handwriting ex- 
pert along the lines so well described and 
depicted by Mr. A. S. Osborn in his unsur- 
passable volume, "Questioned Documents." 
Notwithstanding the many manuscripts Pro- 
fessor Wallace has read, he is in no sense a 
handwriting expert, certainly no more than 
J. 0. Halliwell was. That Sir George Warner 
"scrutinized" the questioned documents and 
pronounced in their favor, notwithstanding 
"a somewhat suspicious air about them," 
proves absolutely nothing. The report of 
Professor Dobbie, the Principal of the gov- 
ernment laboratories, stands in a different 
category; but unfortunately Mr. Law does 
not print the report, contenting himself with 
quoting Professor Dobbie as saying that the 
general appearance of the ink is uniform 
throughout the book, that none of it had faded 
more in one part than in another, and that 
microscopically and chemically the ink shows 



1914] 



THE DIAL 



17 



identical characteristics throughout the pam- 
phlet. But this by no means puts the ques- 
tion out of court. All who have seen the 
original MS., even Mr. Law, have said that 
there are suspicious features about the ques- 
tioned pages, such as the general appearance 
of the writing, the tint of the ink, the pres- 
ence of the names of the dramatists in the 
margin, the character of the ink, the punctua- 
tion, the spelling, etc. 

Mr. Law should not have rested with the 
examination of the ink, for there is nothing 
more certain in modern bibliotics than that 
it is not always possible positively to deter- 
mine whether the ink of a suspected portion 
of a writing is of the same kind as the ink of 
the unsuspected part or whether the two writ- 
ings were made with the same ink. And when, 
in the case of old documents, these questions 
are answered it is important to know whether 
the suspected forger could have obtained or 
made ink of that kind, i. e., whether the for- 
mula of the suspected ink was known to him. 
It is extremely doubtful whether it is possible 
to differentiate the age of the ink in a ques- 
tioned manuscript that is not less than sev- 
enty years old from a genuine writing three 
hundred years old, especially if the chemical 
composition of the two inks was practically 
identical. 

The present inquiry is one of the most diffi- 
cult that a handwriting expert can be called 
upon to decide. We have to deal with the 
question of a simulated holograph purporting 
to have been written between 1604 and 1612. 
The suspected forger did not attempt to copy, 
trace, or imitate any particular individual's 
handwriting. We have, therefore, no standard 
for comparison, and all that is left us to do 
is to study the questioned documents for such 
tell-tale evidences as a forger, unless gifted 
with superhuman cleverness, is sure to leave 
in his work. Such evidence can be found 
only in photographic enlargements of the 
document by direct and by transmitted light. 
Such photographs disclose things unobserva- 
ble by the keenest eye, such as patching, 
over-writing, differences in the ink tints, dif- 
ferences in the pens used, erasures by chemi- 
cal or mechanical means, underlying pencil 
lines, breaks in the continuity of writing (as 
if the writer were drawing instead of writ- 
ing), retouching, writing over the folds in 
the paper (showing whether the writing was 
done before or after the paper was folded, 
very important in this case), whether tears in 
the paper were made before or after the writ- 
ing, differences in line, quality, etc. For these 
purposes the reduced facsimiles published by 
Mr. Law are absolutely valueless. To have 
rendered a really important service to letters 



and to the memory of Cunningham, the biog- 
rapher of Inigo Jones and Nell Gwynn, Mr. 
Law should have provided us with such fac- 
simile enlargements (X30) of parts of the 
suspected MSS., with the full report of Pro- 
fessor Dobbie, with natural size facsimiles of 
parts of the unsuspected MSS., of the writings 
of persons who might have had a hand in 
writing these documents (Tylney, Swanston, 
Cunningham, etc.), for it is not impossible 
that we may some day be able to identify the 
maker of a few pen-strokes from certain 
microscopic characteristics as definite as an in- 
dividual's finger prints. A facsimile of the 
Malone ' ' scrap ' ' would also be of value. 

A trifling matter to which we must call 
attention, because of the proneness of so many 
writers to make incorrect statements con- 
cerning Shakespeare, is Mr. Law's assertion 
(p. 17) that the substantive plural plays does 
not occur anywhere in Shakespeare's works.

loves no Playes," and Rosalind says: "good

Ax ENGLISH STUDY or WALT WHITMAN.* 



Ever since its first appearance, the poetry 
of Walt Whitman has been received as a chal- 
lenge to traditional culture, sounding the note 
of defiance and revolution. But his disciples 
have hailed him also as the discoverer of a 
new world and a new life which is to replace 
entirely the old. Most readers, perhaps, find- 
ing in his poetry a genuine and valuable expe- 
rience, have been bewildered by these extreme 
claims, unable to accept them or reject them 
wholly. They have found in their very real 
experience some implications which seemed 
obviously absurd. Such puzzled readers need 
a work which gives more illumination and less 
heated rhapsody than the essays on Whitman 
which we have become accustomed to. It is 
from this critical point of view that the En- 
glish writer, Mr. Basil de Selincourt, has writ- 
ten his stimulating study. His purpose has 
been to analyze Whitman's poetry, to state 
its principles positively ; and thus make possi- 
ble not only a relation of Whitman with the 
past, but an intelligent estimate of his signifi- 
cance for the future. 

Mr. de Selincourt has devoted about half his 
book to the difficult problem of Whitman's 
art. Here the important feature is the aban- 
donment of metre and the reliance on rhythm 
alone. Since the first appearance of "Leaves 
of Grass" we have of course learned more

thoroughly that rhythm is the more impor- 
tant, and even that great poetry can be writ- 
ten without metre. Nevertheless, since metre 
helps to make the intended cadence clear to 
the reader, Mr. de Selincourt thinks Whitman, 
in abandoning it, made a great sacrifice of 
expressive power. For unless rhythm "is 
communicated with exactitude, the words are 
liable to lose their poetic quality and to be- 
come lifeless." 

In the larger matters of construction of line 
and poem, the author is more sympathetic. 
The basis of construction, it is clear, is the 
line, each line being complete in itself and 
containing in germ the personality of the poet. 
By parallelism, by various devices of repeti- 
tion, line is bound to line to make up a poem. 
The unity of the whole is not at first apparent, 
and is indeed achieved only by atmosphere, by 
the personality of the poet, and not by the 
stricter imaginative or logical continuity. 
This summary of Mr. de Selineourt's chap- 
ters, though bald, is perhaps sufficient to 
justify the statement that in so far as Whit- 
man is great, "it is not his daring unconven- 
tionalities that make him so, though these in 
themselves are such as to argue greatness of 
a kind. He is great because, having chosen 
his method, he takes the consequences of his 
choice with consummate pliability and respon- 
siveness. ' ' 

However, even after deriving from the book 
itself these principles by which to judge it, 
the reader finds that Whitman 's work is very- 
uneven in merit. Mr. de Selincourt explains 
that the poet's power "varied immensely at 
different periods of his life ; and being a poor 
critic of his own writings, he finally arranged 
them without regard for their poetic value, 
considering merely in what order the thought 
of each would be most effective in its contri- 
bution to the thought of all." But the stu- 
dent of Whitman has to realize, as profoundly 
as Whitman did himself, that the poetic value 
of his work is secondary to its thought. His 
perfect lines, indeed, could not alone repre- 
sent him; Whitman without his jargon, his 
bad taste, his absurdities, strange as it may 
seem, would lose much of his peculiar power. 
The grotesque and ugly does have some 
strange function in culture, perhaps a lib- 
erating one; but its presence in Whitman's 
poetry is explained by that wholesale tolerance 
and undiscriminating sympathy which he con- 
sidered a part of the spirit of democracy. 
Whitman ruled out of life the selective prin- 
ciples of reason and taste. 

The real crux in Whitman criticism is this 
conception of spiritual democracy. If we ac- 
cept that, we accept everything, crudeness 
as well as beauty and grace. But it is diffi- 



cult for a young nation to contemplate with 
religious seriousness its crudities. "Growth 
is not a delectable word to those whose task 
it is to be growing. There is even a flavour 
of tactlessness in the use of it under such 
circumstances. " It is not then so strange that 
Whitman should have found his most appre- 
ciative audience over-seas. "Writing for the 
mechanic, the pioneer, the rough, he forgot 
that the rough does not understand or care 
for roughness, craving perpetually to be 
smooth. His primary appeal is to those whose 
ear he would not have thought or cared to 
gain, to authors and teachers, to the cultured 
classes in this old feudal world, to those who 
are sophisticated and tired of sophistication, 
to those who are chafing against limitations 
they must abide by." 

What his countrymen can profit by, how- 
ever, is the courage and insight which could 
find a place in poetry even for the crude and 
the rough. Whitman believed firmly, and in 
his remarkable and too much neglected prose 
writings expressed the idea with great co- 
gency and power, that democracy must be 
based on religious character. In the future 
the human race must learn that its aspira- 
tions to intellectual and artistic culture were 
at least partial, if not worse, and have too 
often stood in the way of the deeper and more 
sacred principle of growth. For Whitman, 
as Mr. de Selincourt says, "is the poet of the 
principle of life, of the pilgrimage and prog- 
ress of the soul, of perpetual growth and 
amelioration, of the joy of spiritual growth."

RECENT FICTION.* 



The novelist's business is to communicate. 
The novelist who takes himself seriously is 
always quite as much concerned about the 
persons to whom he wishes to speak as he is 
about the thing he wishes to say. His work 
is conditioned by their capacity for apprecia- 
tion almost as rigidly as it is by his own 
powers of creation. If he finds that even the 
more clear-seeing and imaginative of his con- 
temporaries are incapable of assigning to sex 
its proper importance in life he may feel com- 
pelled either to over-emphasize that impor-

tance or to ignore it altogether. If he finds 
that all they ask of a heroine is that she be 
beautiful he may compliantly endow his hero- 
ine with all the graces he can think of or he 
may obstinately insist on giving her a squint. 
But whichever the direction of his reaction to 
those he writes for he does inevitably react, to 
the result that he adjusts his presentation of 
his view of life to what he imagines to be their 
view of life. 

Mr. Robert Herrick is conscious of the de- 
mand for heroes and heroines : that is one 
reason why there are none in his novels. Mr. 
Herrick never completely forgets that his 
obligations to his public include that of edu- 
cating it; and everybody knows that educa- 
tion is partly a process of giving plain bread 
and butter to children who would much prefer 
cake. But this point aside, Mr. Herrick can- 
not give us Great Persons because, perhaps, 
he does not believe in them. He is interested 
in types rather than in individuals; which 
is only another way of saying that he is inter- 
ested in the way our society modifies an 
ordinary person rather than in the way an 
extraordinary person modifies our society. 
The formula of "Clark's Field" is precisely 
that of ' ' One Woman 's Life. ' ' The difference 
is that Adelle Clark is a pale, dull, kindly 
creature while Milly Ridge is a pretty, quick, 
ambitious one. Adelle moves among people of 
wealth in spite of herself, because she inherits 
five million dollars. Milly achieves a similar 
place in the world largely by her own effort. 
Oddly enough the story of Adelle is the more 
pleasing of the two; the vein of it is lighter 
or the tone is more genial, it would be hard to 
say which. It is a soundly written analysis 
of the case Mr. Herrick has chosen and if it 
only once reaches any height of emotion it 
contains many entertaining and illuminating 
passages. The chapter devoted to Mr. Ashly 
Crane's attempt to win Adelle by the bold 
bandit method of love-making is perhaps the 
best of these. It should serve excellently for 
reading aloud in those households where the 
habit of reading aloud still persists. But an 
Adelle can never arouse the enthusiasm of 
readers of fiction. Her significance is thrust 
upon her; she is not important of and by 
herself; she is important merely as an exam- 
ple of our social product. It is more than 
possible, as I have suggested, that Mr. Her- 
rick does not believe in persons who are 
anything more than that. If so it is his mis- 
fortune and ours. For nothing less than a 
heroine could serve to bring out Mr. Herrick 's 
best powers. 

Mr. Frank Harris is so interested in the 
conventional demands of English-speaking 
audiences that he has, I imagine, written 



"Great Days" as an experiment in social 
psychology. He wondered what the public, 
or at least the reviewing part of it, would say 
to an adventure story which was written on 
the model G. A. Henty used a hundred times 
but which recorded the hero's experience of 
love a minimum in the same forthright 
fashion as his experience of war. Mr. Harris 
was unable to divest himself of his outfit of 
general ideas or of his satirical view of the 
English upper middle-classes when he came 
actually to the writing of such a yarn even 
though he made the period that of Napoleon's 
rise, but otherwise he has carried out his plan. 
It is too early to know the result. But doubt- 
less it is foreshadowed in the comment of an 
avowedly "radical" literary monthly. This 
comment is to the effect that "Great Days" 
is ' ' the big rough brother of ' Three Weeks, ' ' 
which is a sufficiently astounding misstate- 
ment of the facts to gratify the perverse Mr. 
Harris. The rest of us will hardly be so 
pleased. For if we are still unable in this 
country to see that the difference between 
Mrs. Elinor Glyn and Mr. Frank Harris is a 
basic difference, we have a longer way to 
travel toward intelligent appreciation than is 
pleasant to contemplate. 

It is difficult to say in what respect Miss 
Helen C. Roberts has modified her conception 
of "A Free Hand" in order to present it to 
her prospective audience. She has made an 
earnest, careful, and competent study of a 
man whom the casual American would un- 
hesitatingly pronounce a "dub" but who is 
to a degree made interesting by the desire 
for which Miss Roberts has provided a name 
in her title, as well as by his genuineness. 
Ridley Courage is a dentist, diffident and 
awkward, who marries a young actress, Alison 
Grant, at a time when she is ill and discour- 
aged. She does not love him; does not, in- 
deed, pretend to love him. And when, some 
years later, she finds herself strong again she 
leaves her husband and their small daughter 
in order to go back to the stage. The author's 
sympathy is chiefly with the husband. He 
is of finer, if less triumphant, stuff than his 
wife; and being the more complex of the two 
he is naturally the more interesting to his 
creator. But the reader will be quite as much 
interested in the woman and will wish for 
more about her, which illustrates the inherent 
difficulty of presenting the sort of person who 
cannot justify himself outwardly as well as 
inwardly. Nevertheless, Miss Roberts 's novel 
is an excellent one. The publication of one 
as good by an unknown American writer 
would be an event. Our young novelists are 
not given to expecting so much of their read- 
ers as Miss Roberts does.

Mr. Oliver Onions demands attention as 
the author of the trilogy of which ' ' The Story 
of Louie" was the final volume. His "Gray 
Youth," which is made up of the two novels 
he has written since (and which have recently 
been published in England under the titles 
"The Two Kisses" and "A Crooked Mile") 
is a "clever" book. The first part is a satire 
on the contemporary young woman who thinks 
herself and her chosen friends an enormous 
improvement on the generation which bore 
them, who reads Mr. Frazer's "The Golden 
Bough" and admires "the clear-sighted Wein- 
iger"; the second part is a satire on the 
wealthy social meddler in this case the 
young woman herself married, a mother, and 
possessed of enough money to be dangerous. 
Mr. Onions could have made it much keener 
than it is; at least it is to be hoped that he 
could. None of it cuts very deep and a good 
deal of it appeals to familiar and established 
prejudice. In a word it is too obvious. Mr. 
Onions has set up a target on his own private 
range and that is a pity when there are so 
many shining marks to shoot at. 

Miss May Sinclair, whose very literary 
talent continues to occupy itself chiefly with 
literary figures for the benefit of literary 
readers, wrote a preface for the English edi- 
tion of the stories she offers in "The Return 
of the Prodigal ' ' in which she asked that they 
be given the same consideration as so many 
novels. Only one of the stories, "The Cos- 
mopolitan," which is as long as a brief novel, 
deserves especial attention. It is about a 
woman who sacrificed herself first to her 
father surely the deadliest bore in the 
year's fiction and later to a cause. The 
story which furnishes the title for the volume 
is the least happy of the lot. The action is 
well enough but the details are without veri- 
similitude. Miss Sinclair's conception of the 
inside of a man who made himself a million- 
aire in the Chicago pork-packing industry is 
possible ; her conception of the outside of him 
is absurd. But there is fun usually cruel 
fun in some of the literary stories, like 
"The Wrackham Papers," which Miss Sin- 
clair understands so well how to do. There 
is even, in "Appearances," enough sentiment 
to appease the appetite of the American mag- 
azine editor for whom, no doubt, it was put 
there. 

Mr. Knut Hamsun, who tried on two occa- 
sions to make his way in America and found 
nothing better than a place as a street-car 
conductor in Chicago, has now his revenge. 
His "Shallow Soil," translated into English 
for the first time this year, is a. novel that 
few of the Americans he met will ever hear 
of, but it is also one that hardly one of the 



Americans he failed to meet has equalled. 
There is real feeling behind it and there is 
in it the art to make that feeling effective. 
Mr. Hamsun saw tw r enty years ago or more 
in Christiania a group of young Bohemians 
poets, journalists, and artists whose 
power was altogether out of proportion to 
their merit. His ' ' Shallow Soil ' ' is an attack 
on them, but it is not a propaganda novel in 
the bad sense. It is the story of the loves of 
four or five young people told with quiet 
power. Such a novel compels me again to 
ask why it is that they seem to do these things 
so much better abroad, not only in France, 
where the tradition of prose fiction is so well 
established, and in Russia, but in little coun- 
tries like Denmark and Norw r ay. Do Euro- 
peans write for a more intelligently apprecia- 
tive audience, or do they write for an audience 
much the same as ours, but with more respect ?

BOOKS. 



Dr. Morton Prince has formu- 
lated in his book on "The Un- 
conscious ' ' ( Macmillan ) the 
principles of interpretation of wayward ex- 
pressions of personality. The volume is 
offered as an introduction to certain central 
problems in abnormal psychology. It is pri- 
marily a book for students, and is presented 
in the form of lectures. Viewed from the sur- 
face appearance, and with attention confined 
to the bizarre features of shifting and divid- 
ing and handicapped personalities, the vaga- 
ries of conflicting selves inhabiting the same 
tenement of clay seem fanciful and myste- 
rious, veritable Jekylls and Hydes of lab- 
oratory and clinic. It seems incredible that 
the normal issue of a decently consistent self 
should not be the fate of all; and the suspi- 
cion arises in some cases that the dividing 
chasms are not so deep or so real as the sub- 
jects relate. Phenomena of this kind cannot 
be studied in detachment; as such they may 
appear to be freakish, but freak is a concep- 
tion unrecognized by any self-respecting 
science. Dr. Prince organizes this domain 
with a more minute analysis of relations than 
has yet been attempted. His distinctions are 
drawn with rare acuteness ; and the resulting 
system of interpretation has enduring value; 
however subject to modification, it stands as 
a notable step in the development of the sub- 
ject. Dr. Prince proceeds upon the principle 
that the abnormal phenomena are closely re- 
lated to the normal, the clue to the one is 
the clue to the other. Slight "faults" and 
lapses in normal life both follow and reveal

the course of more serious fissures of per- 
sonality as they appear in the distorted world 
of the abnormal. One of the fundamental 
concepts is that of conservation ; the author 's 
theory of conservation makes it plain that 
consciousness holds the key to but a portion 
of the storehouse. The unconscious vaults are 
essential to the mental economy ; their mode 
of contributing their supplies is peculiar, and 
requires elaborate devices to secure their 
record. Reserving the term subconscious for 
the most general aspect of phenomena out- 
side the ordinary field of conscious awareness 
and control, the author makes the uncon- 
scious the subterranean flow of memories and 
registrations that affect without emerging to 
the surface appearance. They are written in 
the primitive operations, the original primary 
reactions of the nervous system. It is when 
these contributions, together with the sub- 
consciously held material nearer to the focus 
of assimilation, become organized and attempt 
a somewhat independent existence that the 
term coconscious is brought forward ; it desig- 
nates a, more or less firmly organized group 
of responsiveness detached from the central 
personality and collateral with it. That the 
source of these irregularities of the mind's 
coalescence is an emotional one is abundantly 
clear; hysteria is the name of the congenial 
culture-bed in which they grow. The mode 
of their growth is complex indeed, and the 
layman is soon lost in the intricacies and 
entanglements of cross purposes and internal 
strife, to be solved only by the combined dip- 
lomatic skill and strategy of the clinician. To 
those to whom these problems form a serious 
study, Dr. Prince's volume may be recom- 
mended as indispensable. 



Early life 



Under the title, "Early Colle- 
Tn an English giate Life" (Cambridge: W. 
college. Heffer & Sons) , Dr. John Venn 

has prepared a volume of addresses, letters, 
and miscellaneous papers relating to Gonville 
and Caius College, Cambridge, popularly 
known as "Keys." As an undergraduate of 
the college, and now its president, Dr. Venn 
has a special sentiment for all the details 
which he has collected from old records, old 
bursars' books, and kindred sources. Grouped 
as these studies are to form a continuous, 
though informal, history of educators in one 
of the units of a great university, they are 
absorbing reading, especially to those at all 
familiar with collegiate life in England. The 
first paper, "The Memory of Our Benefac- 
tors," gives a very appealing account of 
various early donors whose gifts of books, 
windows, plate, braziers, or of pecuniary 



helps for poor scholars have been allowed to 
suffer neglect or loss of personal tradition at 
the hands of their academic heirs. Vividly, 
and with a fine spirit of appreciation, this 
living master calls the roll of the early stu- 
dents, fellows, and patrons of the college, and 
brings back from oblivion many a brief tale 
of devotion to academic institution. The 
accounts of pre-Reformation days, from the 
founding in 1348 until the monks were ban- 
ished, bring very close to us the actual life 
of the young men who with icy fingers con- 
sulted the huge folios chained to the read- 
ing desk, as they sought to amass material 
for their learned disputations. We see the 
students at "commons" listening drearily 
enough to the voice of the clerk appointed to 
read aloud some religious treatise during 
meal time. The close relationship between 
monastic life and college life is pictured all 
along, and especially in the chapter "Monks 
in College, ' ' where Dr. Venn accounts for the 
presence of so many young men from the 
monasteries. They were selected by prior or 
abbot because of some special promise, and 
were sent to the university to gain that 
knowledge of Divinity or of Canon or Civil 
Law which would enable them to transact 
business with prelates or with high secular 
authorities, when the monastery needed 
trained and shrewd judgment. Some of these 
young monks were elevated to posts of great 
distinction in later life. A more cheerful note 
in scholastic life is to be observed when, in 
1580, drastic rules about "fote-ball" were 
drawn up, and any student caught playing 
this game with students of other colleges was 
in danger of being "openly corrected with 
the rod in the common schools by some of the 
University officers." In the seventeenth and 
eighteenth centuries the amenities of life oc- 
cupied more time, as may be seen in the let- 
ters written by young gentlemen who show 
much concern regarding their apparel. "I 
have sent you mine hatcase that you may 
send up my new hat : I have very much need 
on it. ' ' The last chapter is a most interesting 
account of the routine of college life sixtj r 
years ago. With its brief bits of biography, 
its glimpses into a hidden past, its reconstruc- 
tion of ancient life, the volume gives a very 
sympathetic introduction to a great founda- 
tion. 

The enterprise, energy, and suc-

her two-year-old daughter, went 
out to the Far West, filed a homesteader's

many feathers to her cap that, as she ex- 
pressed it, she felt as if she were wearing a

feather duster on her head, are related in 
racy, idiomatic, unstudied style by the hero- 
ine herself in a series of letters to a friend, 
written in the midst of the new experiences 
and with manifest guiltlessness of ulterior 
designs on the writer's part toward the read- 
ing public. These "Letters of a Woman 
Homesteader" (Houghton) are signed at 
first, "Elinore Rupert," but before a year 
is out the confession is made that within six 
weeks of the homesteader's arrival at Burnt 
Fork, Wyoming, the scene of the narrative, 
she had allowed herself to be wooed and won 
by the worthy and, we will add, discerning 
Scot whose homestead adjoined the one that 
was ere long to be hers, and who had engaged 
her services as housekeeper; and after this 
interesting confession she signs herself by her 
new name, which appears on the title-page as 
"Elinore Pruitt Stewart," Pruit being, as 
she explains in one of her letters, her patro- 
nymic. One suspects that the canny Scots- 
man's quick surrender to her charms was 
partly effected by her display of a remarka- 
ble range and variety of useful accomplish- 
ments. She delighted him by her ability to 
run the mowing machine and to milk the cows 
no less than by her efficiency as cook and 
laundress and dairy maid; for she had early 
been left an orphan in the Indian Territory, 
and had learned farming as well as house- 
keeping. Small wonder, then, that though 
she had never had a day's schooling, she was 
equal to the task of learning to write, and that 
finally she wrote such letters that "The At- 
lantic Monthly" was glad to publish them 
when by some kind providence they were 
brought to the editor's attention; and those 
letters, now collected in a book, give promise 
of attaining no inconsiderable fame in the 
literary world. They are, indeed, an example 
of that variety of the unexpected which make 
it worth while to be an editor. Mrs. Stewart 's 
enthusiasm for homesteading is infectious, as 
are also the high spirits and jollity of her 
admirable letters. Her neighbors are made to 
live and breathe before our eyes as she hits 
off their various peculiarities and amiabili- 
ties; to their faults and foibles, if they have 
any, she makes no allusion. It is a hearty and 
wholesome book. Six good drawings accom- 
pany the reading matter. 



Problems of 
immigration. 



There has been issued recently 
a third edition, revised and en- 
larged, of "The Immigration 

Problem" (Funk & Wagnalls Co.), by Dr. 

Jeremiah W. Jenks and Mr. W. Jett Lauek. 

In its original form the book possessed distinct 

qualities of superiority. Its authors, both of 



whom are recognized as experts in the fields 
of economics and social legislation, were as- 
sociated with Senator Dillingham's Immigra- 
tion Commission throughout the four years 
of its researches, and in their book they in- 
corporated the most authentic and significant 
information contained in the forty-two mas- 
sive volumes of material which the Commis- 
sion published. They wrote, not as advocates, 
but as recorders and interpreters of facts. In 
the present edition the subject matter is 
brought up to date, with the aid of the census 
of 1910 and of the most recent reports of the 
Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization. 
Many chapters, including that on Recent Im- 
migrants in Agriculture, have been rewritten, 
and new tables, charts, and texts of legisla- 
tive measures notably the literacy-test sec- 
tion of the Dillingham-Burnett Bill vetoed 
by President Taft in February, 1913, and the 
California Alien Land Ownership Act of May, 
1913 have been added. In their first edi- 
tion the authors declared for a more effec- 
tive restriction of immigration and suggested 
as the most desirable mode the imposition of 
an educational test. In the new edition they 
take occasion to lay added stress upon these 
recommendations. They say that a policy of 
permanent or absolute exclusion is not im- 
perative. But they maintain that if the 
influx of immigrant wage-earners shall be 
allowed to continue at its present rate there 
is "no ground for expecting any noteworthy 
improvement in the near future in the work- 
ing and living conditions of the employees of 
our mines and factories." Admitting that 
the adoption of a policy of restriction might 
be attended by a temporary check in the 
rapidity of the remarkable industrial expan- 
sion of the last few years, they remind the 
reader, in a convincing manner, that the true 
measure of the economic welfare of the citi- 
zens of an industrial and commercial nation 
does not consist in the number of tons of coal 
produced or the tons of pig iron, steel rails, 
or yards of print cloth manufactured. The 
present situation is declared to be developing 
social and political dangers which demand 
immediate action. Coming from the average 
writer upon the immigration problem, an 
assertion of this nature might well be dis- 
counted. Coming from students of the well- 
known sanity and judiciousness of Messrs. 
Jenks and Lauck, the declaration merits the 
reflection of every serious-minded citizen. 
With respect to the immigration of Oriental 
peoples, it is maintained that the country's 
present policy is entirely justifiable, although 
it is pointed out that the form of selection 
might well be modified "so as not to wound 
the national susceptibilities of any people."

Chelsea ' Blunt has made 

celebrities himself an authority on Chelsea, 

major and minor. itg h is toly an( J traditions, its 

greater and lesser celebrities. His latest work 
on his favorite theme bears the title, "In 
Cheyne Walk and Thereabout" (Lippincott), 
and presents to view some of the less familiar 
characters and old-time haunts of that his- 
toric portion of the Thames riverside. Thus 
we have chapters on Mjary Astell, Don Saltero 
and his coffee-house, Dr. Bartholomew Do- 
meniceti and his baths, James Neilds the 
philanthropist, and his eccentric son, John 
Camden Neilds, and others, with an account of 
the Chelsea Porcelain Factory, and another of 
the Physic Garden of the Worshipful Society 
of Apothecaries. Necessarily the great Sir 
Hans Sloane and the Carlyles and Whistler 
and others of high renown play some part in 
Mr. Blunt 's narrative; and the famous man- 
sion bought by Sloane in 1736 (and recently 
made the subject of an interesting volume by 
Mr. Randall Davies "The Greatest House 
at Chelsea") has its history briefly outlined in 
one of the chapters. Light is thrown on the 
character and accomplishments of Sloane by 
extracts from the little-known "Narrative of 
Some of the Occurrences in the Life of Ed- 
mund Howard of the Parish of Chelsea." 
Howard was in the famous naturalist's em- 
ployment as servant, and seems to have been 
a shrewdly observant person. But the best 
of the book is reserved till the last, when the 
author reproduces four unpublished letters 
from Mrs. Carlyle to her maid Jessie (now 
Mrs. Broadfoot of Thornhill) and adds details 
furnished him by Mrs. Broadfoot herself 
all illustrating the amiability of maid Jessie's 
master and mistress, and correcting certain 
widely prevalent misconceptions. Mr. Blunt 's 
father, it appears, was rector of Chelsea at 
the time of Mjrs. Carlyle 's sudden death, and 
thus the author is enabled to correct Froude's 
characteristically inaccurate account of that 
period in the life of the Carlyles. Note- 
worthy illustrations from scarce old photo- 
graphs and engravings contribute to the 
interest of the book. 






The field of Egyptian archae- 
ology has just been resurveyed

Gaston Maspero's "Manual" (Putnam), ed- 
ited by Mrs. C. H. W. Johns. As M. Mas- 
pero 's other activities kept him fully occupied, 
the new editor, who is the sister of the able 
English Egyptologist F. LI. Griffith, must be 
credited with whatever changes appear. Mrs. 
Johns has transferred to their proper places 
in the author's scheme the data which in the 
fifth edition (1902) were lumped in a "sup- 



plementary chapter." She has also incor- 
porated the most important discoveries which 
have taken place since that time. Among these 
may be mentioned the structure of the pyra- 
mid complex, with its four parts: valley 
temple, ascending causeway, mortuary temple 
on the plateau, and pyramid proper behind all, 
as revealed in the excavations at Abusir and 
Gizeh. Further work at Der el-Bahri on the 
western edge of ancient Thebes has shown that 
Queen Hatshepsut's mortuary temple, like 
that which in earlier days stood at the east 
side of the royal pyramid (to which Hatshep- 
sut's cliff tomb excavated in the desolate val- 
ley behind is in this age analogous), was 
connected by a causeway with a gateway tem- 
ple down in the river valley. The terraced 
form of Hatshepsut's cliff temple, which she 
had received credit for originating, has also 
been found to be modelled on an Eleventh Dy- 
nasty temple* lying immediately south of it 
and built before 2000 B. c., over five hundred 
years earlier. The "short table of the prin- 
cipal epochs of Egyptian history" included 
for the first time is a convenient addition. 
The "Manual," however, does not in the text 
always distinguish different stages of devel- 
opment, as, for example, in the description 
of "moving statues" (p. 127). The intrusion 
of priestcraft into politics there indicated did 
not reach its height until the end of the "New 
Kingdom. ' ' The history of the pyramid form 
continues to be suggested, but not sharply 
brought out. A few well-chosen half-tone 
plates supplement the cuts (many of them 
badly worn), which the publishers have re- 
tained from earlier editions. M. Maspero's 
"Manual of Egyptian Archasology ' ' in its re- 
vised and improved form, though neither abso- 
lutely accurate nor thoroughly systematic, is 
by its compactness and readability well suited 
to the prominent place which this work has so 
long held. 

Few Americans have been made 
New e Engiand the subject of more books and 
statesman. essays, sketches and speeches, 
than New Hampshire's most illustrious son, 
Daniel Webster. To the dozen or more exist- 
ing biographies of this great statesman, jurist, 
and orator, a by no means negligible addition 
is now made in Professor Frederic Austin 
Ogg's "Daniel Webster" (Jacobs), in the 
series of "American Crisis Biographies.'" 
As the author says in his preface, "the sub- 
ject is old, and yet ever fresh. The shelves 
of our libraries groan under the masses of 
books relating to it. Yet neglected or largely 
unused materials are still being brought to

light ; and so intricately do the life and work 
of the man enter into the very texture of 
the nation's history that they are very nearly 
as incapable of full and final interpretation 
as is that history itself." The recent pub- 
lication of Professor Van Tyne's "Letters of 
Daniel Webster," and of the eighteen-volume 
"National Edition" of his "Writings and 
Speeches," has made readily available the 
most important of the original sources to 
which a biographer of Webster naturally 
turns ; and these sources have been studiously 
consulted by Professor Ogg. Inevitably and 
rightly, it is the public activities rather than 
the private life and character of the man that 
receive chief attention in this "American 
Crisis" biography. For the more intimately 
human side of his nature we already have Mr. 
Fisher's "True Daniel Webster" and the 
earlier "Private Life" by Lanman. Though 
modestly calling his book a "sketch," Dr. Ogg 
has filled four hundred closely printed pages 
with his careful study of his subject; and 
that, too, without over-weighting the volume 
with extracts from Webster's writings and 
speeches. What references and quotations do 
occur seem aptly illustrative and to the point. 
Some disapproval, no doubt, will be his por- 
tion for not condemning more unsparingly the 
act that inspired Whittier's "Ichabod" and 
made Horace Mann call Webster "a fallen 
star." That, however, is a dead issue to the 
present generation. A useful chronological 
survey of Webster's life precedes the main 
narrative, and a four-page bibliography fol- 
lows it, after which comes the index. No life 
of Webster the statesman could, in the same 
compass, well prove more satisfactory. 

Until less than a century ago 

The social , j j i_ 

position of deal mutes were regarded much 
as the insane, or at least the 
feeble-minded, are now regarded, and the pos- 
sibility of their being educated to fill positions 
of usefulness and honor on the same footing 
as their less unfortunate fellow citizens had 
dawned upon the minds of but few. Their 
present position in an enlightened country 
like our own, with especial consideration of 
the educational problem they present and the 
provision made for their schooling in this 
country, is treated with evident thoughtful- 
ness, and after a careful study of the whole 
subject, by Mr. Harry Best in a volume of 
the Crowell Library of Economics entitled 
' ' The Deaf : Their Position in Society and the 
Provision for Their Education in the United 
States." Of the two headings under which 
the theme is treated, as indicated in the sub- 
title, it is to the second that by far the greater 
space is allotted and rightly enough, for 



the position of the deaf among their fellow 
beings ought not to be considered so anoma- 
lous as to require extended discussion. But 
in this first and less important section of the 
book it is interesting to note that the pro- 
portion of deaf and dumb to the whole 
population of the country has considerably 
decreased in the last thirty years, according 
to census figures, though this proportion is 
almost exactly the same as in 1830, the first 
year cited in the table. Our deaf and dumb 
now number about forty-four thousand, or 
about four hundred and seventy-six to the 
million inhabitants. It is also noteworthy 
that heredity has been found to play a less 
important part in deafness than is commonly 
supposed. If both parents are congenitally 
deaf, with deafness prevalent in their fami- 
lies, there is danger of deafness in the off- 
spring; but "adventitious" deafness seems 
not likely to be transmitted. In the section 
of the book devoted to the history of the edu- 
cation of the deaf and dumb, and to an ac- 
count of what is now done for their training 
by the nation and the separate states, there 
is evidence of the greatest care and thorough- 
ness, the references to authoritative sources 
of information being innumerable. As a 
study of his subject so far as our country 
is concerned, Mr. Best's treatise is the full- 
est yet published ; and what is more, its tone 
throughout its refusal to consider the deaf 
as objects of charity is sane and wholesome, 
and promotive of self-respect and self-help 
in the handicapped but not disabled sufferers 
from the lack of one of the five senses. 



The pioneer 

county 

library. 



On the first day of the present 

,-, -, . . * -, , 

century there was dedicated at 

y an Wert> Q h j o> the firgt coun ty 

library, in the fullest sense of the term, almost 
a decade before the now famous California 
system of county libraries came into being, 
and well in advance of similar movements in 
other States. The Van Wert institution owed 
its origin to the munificence and foresight of 
John Sanford Brumback, banker, financier, 
and, in earlier years, successful merchant, of 
that city. From the pen of his daughter, Mrs. 
Saida Brumback Antrim, who has from the 
beginning served as secretary of the library 
board, and from that of her husband, Ernest 
Irving Antrim, Ph.D., there now appears a 
handsome volume, "The County Library," 
narrating the history of the Van Wert library 
and describing its county-wide activities, and 
also presenting a careful summary of the 
county library movement in the United States. 
The life of Mr. Brumback is briefly reviewed 
in the opening chapter, and, in addition to 
Mrs. Antrim's preface, a commendatory in-

troduction is furnished by Dr. P. P. Claxton, 
national Commissioner of Education. A map, 
forty-two illustrations from photographs, a 
full and accurate index, and various statis- 
tical tables, complete the book's ample equip- 
ment. Especially worthy of note are the care 
with which the every-day working of the 
Brumback Library in all its departments and 
branches is made clear to the reader; the 
indubitability of the proof that this is chrono- 
logically the first free public library actively 
operating throughout an entire county; and 
the diligent research shown in the concluding 
section, on the county library movement as 
a whole. The county library is gaining rap- 
idly in favor and importance, and the end is 
by no means yet in sight. This book will aid 
and hasten the development of the movement, 
and is sure to prove a useful manual as well 
as an interesting account of what has been 
done and is being done in county library work 
in a representative district of our middle 
West. (The Pioneer Press, Van Wert, Ohio.) 

A commendable contribution to 
ba'ekwlrd child. *& important practical topic 

is Barbara Spofford Morgan's 
"The Backward Child" (Putnam). Despite 
serious limitations of plan and execution, it 
presents the virtue of an original attempt to 
see into and through the problem, and to 
bring to bear upon it the available principles 
of psychology supported by sound common 
sense. The varieties of tests to be used in 
securing a diagnosis of the type and range 
of defect which ordinary yet difficult school 
children present are set forth in simple lan- 
guage, and in a form that facilitates appli- 
cation. The art of treatment and relief is 
likewise considered. The book is certain to be 
helpful to the large number of teachers who 
have to deal with all sorts and conditions of 
children; particularly to those with limited 
opportunities to determine the nature of the 
deviations thus presented to the normal stand- 
ards to which educational measures are ad- 
justed. Yet both the psychology and the 
pedagogy of the volume are casual ; and many 
of the analyses are given with an assurance 
that finds slight support in sound principle; 
nor are the available findings of psychology 
adequately utilized. For all this there is 
good excuse in the newness of the subject and 
the lack of accredited procedures. It is a 
pity that study showing a rather unusual 
power to approach a subject without the hack- 
neyed and irrelevant preconceptions that 
makes so much of pedagogy futile, should not 
have been raised to a still greater value by a 
deeper insight into the rationale of the proc- 
esses to be practically applied. None the less 



the book may be recommended as adapted to 
many of the situations that actually confront 
the correction of backwardness with which the 
teacher must deal. Measured by the stand- 
ards of recent contributions, the volume de- 
serves a prominent place in the teacher's 
library. 



Disraeli on 
Whigs and 
Whiggism. 



In his compilation entitled 
"Whigs and Whiggism" (Mac- 
millan), Mr. William Hutcheon 
has put together such of Disraeli's political 
writings as deal particularly with what Dis- 
raeli regarded as Whig ideas and to which 
he developed an early aversion. The volume 
is composed chiefly of contributions to the 
"Times," the "Morning Post," and the 
"Press," and some of these are reprinted now 
for the first time. The general reader will not 
be intensely interested in Disraeli's vindictive 
attacks on his aristocratic enemies ; but to the 
student of English history the volume will 
prove very useful, as it will enable him to 
understand how the Jewish radical came to 
be identified with the Tory party and even 
became the recognized chief to whom the con- 
servative classes entrusted the defence of the 
"land" and the "church." It will also help 
us to measure the distance that journalism 
has travelled along the road toward decency 
in political discussion : language such as Dis- 
raeli used in his tirade in the "Morning Post" 
in 1835 ("Peers and People") would no 
longer be tolerated even in the most partisan 
of party organs. The editor has contributed 
a brief introductory chapter in which he 
traces Disraeli's career as a contributor to 
the political discussions of the day, and ac- 
counts for his alliance with Lord Lyndhurst 
and other Tory leaders. The volume also con- 
tains several interesting illustrations, includ- 
ing three facsimile letters. 






There is nothing remarkable 
aoout the random memories 
which Miss Joan Arden weaves 
together in her account of "A Childhood" 
(Macmillan). Scattered impressions that 
stand out with a weird vividness possessed by 
nothing grown-up, magical in their sug- 
gestive incompleteness, mysterious because 
half-understood, often terrifying, often un- 
consciously cruel, of such things, in retro- 
spect, is every childhood made. But it is 
another matter to record these memories with- 
out brushing off the bloom that makes them 
alive and lovely and wonderful. Perhaps only 
a shy, self-conscious little girl could grow up 
to do it: a child whose world is largely in 
her imagination, and whose experiences are 
more poignant because so seldom shared.

Such a child was the author of this book ; with 
her, childhood was more than ordinarily a 
hidden life; and more than ordinarily un- 
dimmed and vital are her memories of it. A 
preface by Mr. Gilbert Murray pays tribute to 
the sustained interest that Miss Arden has 
managed to create without any narrative con- 
tinuity. And that is the essence of child- 
hood's tale: that it shall seem a random 
proem to something sadder and sterner and 
greater, though giving no hint what the 
greater things may be. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The Rt. Rev. W. Boyd Carpenter, Canon of 
Westminster, delivered the Belden lectures at Har- 
vard University in 1913 ; his subject was " The 
Spiritual Message of Dante." The lectures have 
now been gathered into a volume issued by the 
Harvard University Press. Their purport is 
modestly explained by the author : " They are 
simply thoughts on religious experience as ex- 
emplified in Dante's poem." 

There is food for reflection in the genial pages 
of "America through the Spectacles of an Oriental 
Diplomat" (Stokes). Hon. Wu Tingfang, for- 
mer minister from China to the United States, has 
travelled much and resided in various lands, and 
what he sees in America cannot but interest Ameri- 
cans. His opinions of us are in the main very 
agreeable to our self-satisfaction, but he does not 
scruple to tell us frankly, though always with 
Chinese tact and courtesy, of certain of our fail- 
ings and follies. Some of his suggestions for 
improvement for instance that the title of our 
chief executive should be changed from president 
to emperor may have been made in the spirit of 
humor, with possibly a sting concealed ; but others 
are wholly serious and demand consideration. 

The art-loving tourist is sure to welcome Profes- 
sor John C. Van Dyke's " New Guides to Old 
Masters" (Scribner), a series of individual guide- 
books of critical appreciation to the important 
art-galleries of Europe. Of the twelve volumes 
comprising the series two have already been 
issued, one dealing with the National Gallery 
and the Wallace Collection in London, and one de- 
scribing the treasures of the Louvre in Paris. Only 
the best pictures of the old masters are considered ; 
and the art of the canvas is dwelt upon rather than 
its origin, name, pedigree, or commercial value. 
No space is given to mediocre or ruined examples 
by even celebrated painters, the text dealing en- 
tirely with merits that now exist and may be seen 
by any intelligent observer. Instead of repeating 
oft-told tales of things past and belonging to a 
vanished age, the discussion of each picture is con- 
fined to decorative form, color, handling, method, 
manner, style, things seen and vital to-day and 
forever. A general Introduction, and a bibliog- 
raphy of the best books for further study, both 
applicable to the whole series, form special fea- 
tures of importance in the first volume. The flexi- 
ble covers and pocket size are conveniences.

mance Languages at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology. 

Mr. Wyndham Lewis's new illustrated quarterly, 
" Blast," will evidently excite disgust in some quar- 
ters, amusement in others, and enthusiasm in still 
others. The announcement of the first number 
describes it as " The Manifesto of the Vorticists. 
The English Parallel Movement to Cubism and Ex- 
pressionism. Imagism in Poetry. Deathblow to 
Impressionism and Futurism and All the Refuse of 
Naif Science," etc., etc. Among the contributors 
are Jacob Epstein, Ezra Pound, Rebecca West, 
Laurence Atkinson, Gaudier-Brzeska, and Ford 
Madox Hueffer. 

Baroness Bertha von Suttner died June 21 at 
Vienna, aged 71. She was awarded the Nobel 
Peace Prize in 1905, largely on account of her 
novel " Die Waffen nieder " and her work as 
editor of the magazine of the same name pub- 
lished by the international peace bureau at Berne. 
Baroness von Suttner was the daughter of Field 
Marshall Count Franz von Kinsky and when a 
girl was betrothed to Prince Adolph Wittgenstein, 
but he was killed in battle. She gave instructions 
before her death that her body was to be cremated 
without religious ceremony, speeches, or flowers. 
Baroness von Suttner spent part of the year 1912 
lecturing in the United States on behalf of interna- 
tional peace. Her recent novel, " When Thoughts 
Will Soar," was published in this country last 
week.

BOOK PRODUCTION 
FOR AUTHORS 

'"PHE HENRY O. SHEPARD COM- 
PANY begs to direct attention to 
its very unusual facilities for the pro- 
duction of authors' books, whether in 
special or trade editions. 

AS publishers of THE DIAL and 
^ THE INLAND PRINTER, two 

periodicals whose typographical excel- 
lence is recognized throughout the 
country, this establishment is in posi- 
tion to guarantee the superior quality 
of its output. 

HPHE same minute care and atten- 
tion that go to the production of 
these two periodicals is at the service 
of authors desirous of having their 
books produced in correct and attrac- 
tive form. 

"C^VERY detail pertaining to the 
production of a book will be un- 
dertaken, revision of the manuscript, 
type composition either by machine or 
by hand, proofreading, selection of 
the paper, presswork, preparation of 
design for and execution of the bind- 
ing. In addition, if desired, the ordi- 
nary publishing details will be attended 
to, such as sending editorial copies to the 
press, filling orders from the trade, etc. 

15 Y taking advantage of this service, 
authors may rest assured of having 
their books produced in more correct 
and attractive form, at considerably 
less expense, than if the work were 
entrusted to the ordinary publisher 
making a specialty of authors' editions.

THE EVERY-DAY LIFE OF 

ABRAHAM LINCOLN 

A NARRATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE BIOGRAPHY, WITH PEN-PICTURES 
AND PERSONAL RECOLLECTIONS BY THOSE WHO KNEW HIM 

BY 
FRANCIS FISHER BROWNE 

Compiler of " Golden Poems," "Bugle Echoes: Poems of the Civil War" 
"Laurel-Crowned Verse" etc. 

HpHIS biography of Lincoln brings the man, not the tradition, 
A very near to us. It is Lincoln as his friends and daily associates 
knew him what he said to them, how he looked and acted while 
saying it anecdotes and stories by the hundred, all woven into a 
continuous narrative which holds the reader like a book of fiction. 

" There need be no hesitation in pronouncing this one of the 
best biographies in existence." The Review of Reviews. 

" It would be hard to name anything in Lincoln literature giving 
in popular form so sound and personal a picture of Lincoln the 
man." The Outlook. 

" No other book brings the reader so close to the actual Lincoln 
as this." The Churchman. 

This book will become and long remain the standard 'Life' of 
the great 'Emancipator.'" Zion Herald.

Author of "Why Worry," "Those Nerves,"

This handbook has been prepared to meet the 
needs of the novice, who must learn to recognize the 
specimens he would study. The flowers are arranged 
according to color, which method as used in Dr. 
Walton's previous volume proved of such great 
assistance to the non- botanist. In this way anyone 
can quickly and readily identify practically every 
flower by means of the color charts classified in 
groups. With its 590 illustrations, from drawings 
and photographs, conveniently arranged and 
indexed, there is no other volume as complete and 
practical for the amateur as this.

VENUS LAMIA 

Fierce flames fell on your broto upturned 

To meet th' eternal Night; 
Immortal fire from heaven came down 

To mafye your dark eyes bright; 
Your cruel limbs, your shapely form. 

The high gods wrought their best; 
They stamped with kisses soft and sweet 

Their image on your breast. 

They formed your subtle nerves and veins, 

And bade your pulses swell; 
They filled your breathing flesh with life, 

And shaped your spirit well. 
Then down the changing aisles of time 

Wiih solemn chant they came, 
And to the sound of silver harps 

They syllabled your name. 



THIS edition includes, besides a few later poems, three separate 
books published at different times "Flowers of Song from 
Many Lands," a collection of poetic translations; "A Book of 
Quatrains," both original and translated (now revised and enlarged); 
and original verse which first appeared alone under the title of the 
present volume. 

Epigrams that snap crowd the pages; the quatrains might well 
serve as the text of many a longer discourse; and the descriptions are 
classically apt. The catholicity of the book is marked. From the 
very refinement of philosophy, ancient and modern, to the prayer of 
an Indian raider for scalps and the sacrificial hymn of the South Sea 
Island cannibals is a far cry, and the transition requires an unusual 
limberness of poetic fibre, yet each subject in its turn is given the 
form and atmosphere best suited to it. That rhythm and metre are 
beyond reproach needs no saying. 

The collection is a representative selection of a mature poet's work, 
covering a lifetime of emotions and the spirit of many centuries of 
philosophical wisdom.

A LIVE WIRE. 

The recent visit to Chicago of a company of 
New York city officials, headed by Mayor 
Mitchell, for the purpose of inspecting the 
school systems of this vicinity, was an event 
whose significance needs to be emphasized. 
We have often asserted that the mayor of a 
large American city has no greater responsi- 
bility than that which is associated with the 
management of its public schools, and that 
the most important function he exercises is 
that of appointing the school trustees. How 
that responsibility has been evaded, and how 
that function has been subordinated to polit- 
ical interests by the mayors of Chicago as far 
back as memory reaches provides material for 
a melancholy chapter in our civic annals. It 
would be difficult to imagine a mayor of Chi- 
cago taking the matter of public education as 
seriously as the New York executive seems to 
have taken it, although our present executive 
head, in one of his earlier terms, once went 
so far as to appoint a really competent com- 
mission to investigate the subject. It is true 
that the findings of that commission were 
almost completely ignored, but the fact of its 
creation was encouraging. It remains, never- 
theless, about the only thing ever done by a 
mayor of Chicago to indicate a sense that the 
duties of the executive office in relation to the 
schools extend to something beyond rewarding 
political supporters, seeing that nationalities 
and religions and topographical areas are rep- 
resented in school affairs, and determining the 
award of fat contracts to the deserving. 

It is not, however, our present purpose to 
enlarge upon the history of school manage- 
ment in Chicago, but rather to suggest a 
point of view which is material to the judg- 
ment to be passed upon the recent outburst 
of educational activity on the part of 'the New 
York authorities. Our approval of the in- 
vestigation is considerably lessened when we 
remember that Mayor Mitchell is the one re- 
sponsible for the continuance in office of 
Mr. Thomas W. Churchill as President of the 
New York Board of Education. During his 
previous term, Mr. Churchill's activities had 
proved so mischievous and so demoralizing to 
the interests of the New York schools that 



THE DIAL, 



[July 16 



protests against his reappointment came from 
practically all educators who observed the sit- 
uation at close range and were competent to 
pass upon it. These protests were so pro- 
nounced and so weighty that only a politician 
could have ignored them, but Mr. Mitchell 
flouted the consensus of intelligent profes- 
sional opinion upon the subject by extending 
the term of Mr. Churchill's authority. Many 
illustrations of his unfitness for the office 
might be adduced, but numbers could not 
make the argument more convincing than the 
single instance we are about to give. 

It is well known that for many years the 
superintendency of the New York city schools 
has been in the very competent hands of 
Dr. William H. Maxwell, one of the most 
highly respected of American educators. Some- 
time last fall, the Public Education Associa- 
tion of New York, a voluntary organization 
of men and women working in the interest of 
the schools, invited Dr. Maxwell to attend a 
conference on the educational budget for the 
year. President Churchill, learning of this 
invitation, wrapped himself in the robes of 
his little brief authority, and wrote to the 
veteran educator and New York Superinten- 
dent of fifteen years' standing a letter con- 
taining the following amazing sentence: 
"You are therefore requested not to attend 
this conference, and to direct the superinten- 
dents or other officers immediately under your 
direction that no attention should be paid to 
the request to appear at such conference 
unless the Board of Education, or its Presi- 
dent, grants permission." Dr. Maxwell's 
reply to this ukase was dignified but uncom- 
promising. We quote the significant passages. 

" In reply I beg leave to say that I have received 
and have accepted an invitation to be present at 
this conference. In this case I feel justified in 
reaching a decision not in accord with your views. 
I have ever regarded it as part, indeed a large 
part, of my duty as a public officer, to give infor- 
mation regarding the schools and their work to 
any citizen or any body of citizens who asked for 
it, to defend publicly their work, their administra- 
tion, and my own actions against unjust attack, 
and to profit by just criticism and opportune sug- 
gestion. It is in pursuance of this policy that I 
have in the past attended public meetings to con- 
sider educational questions, that I have accepted 
the invitation of the Public Education Association 
for September 22, and that I purpose to continue 
to attend such meetings. 

" You request further that I ' direct the super- 
intendents or other officers immediately under your 
(my) direction that no attention should be paid to 
the request to appear at such conference.' I 



regret exceedingly that I cannot comply with this 
request. I do not find, either in the law or in the 
by-laws of the Board of Education, that any 
authority has been conferred on the City Superin- 
tendent of Schools to ' direct ' his colleagues as to 
their attendance on outside meetings. Even if such 
authority had been conferred on the City Superin- 
tendent, it would be inconsistent with my ideas of 
the courtesy that ought to prevail among ladies 
and gentlemen, to ' direct ' my colleagues to pay 
' no attention ' to an invitation from any reputable 
body of citizens to participate in a conference. I 
conceive it to be the duty of all teachers to set to 
the youth of our city an example of appropriate 
courtesy in the ordinary intercourse of life. Such 
courtesy is due to all men and women of whatever 
estate. It certainly should not be lacking toward 
the Public Education Association, composed, as it 
is, of men and women who have taken a deep 
interest in our public schools, and who have done 
so much to aid every worthy effort for their 
advancement and to defeat every attempt at their 
injury. 

" But there is a still stronger reason why the 
City Superintendent should not ' direct ' officers 
'immediately under his direction' not to attend 
conferences. When a man becomes an officer in 
the public education service, he loses none of the 
rights of an American citizen. Free speech is one 
of those rights. I have too keen a sense of the 
limitations of my official authority, and too pro- 
found a regard for the institutions of my country, 
to attempt to interfere with the right of free 
speech, even at the request of the President of the 
Board of Education." 

We are not surprised that the magazine "Edu- 
cation," quoting this letter, calls it "one of 
the greatest educational documents of the 
year," and adds that "its influence will be 
widespread and permanent." 

This correspondence illustrates in a striking 
fashion a defect which is found in most of 
our municipal school systems. The rights and 
duties of a superintendent should be so de- 
fined and protected by law as to make this 
sort of petty tyranny impossible, and to keep 
the activities of boards of education within 
proper bounds. Unfortunately, they are not, 
in most of our states, thus safeguarded, and, 
in consequence, we find nearly everywhere 
that fussy and self-important school trustees, 
whose legitimate business it is to manage the 
finances of the system and decide broad prin- 
ciples of educational policy, are interfering 
and dictating in strictly professional matters 
with which they have no rightful concern. 
For the educational side of the system, it is 
their business to employ experts, and then 
leave them a free hand. Any confusion be- 
tween the functions of trusteeship and admin- 
istration is bound to be harmful, and ought 



1914] 



THE DIAL

to be made impossible. The ideal school board 
is one whose powers are strictly limited, in 
whose membership there is no representation 
of special groups or interests, and whose num- 
bers are not too large to permit of all being 
seated around a small table and carrying on 
their discussions in a conversational tone. It 
is the indulgence in oratory that plays the 
mischief in board meetings, and makes real 
deliberation impossible. President Eliot has 
been urging this ideal upon us for many years, 
and it is time that we should heed his sane 
and sober counsel. 

Returning to Mr. Churchill, it is obvious 
that any further exhibition of his unfitness 
to hold the position he occupies must be of 
the nature of an anti-climax, but there are one 
or two other matters of which we are impelled 
to say a word. It was only the other day that 
he distinguished himself by a violent on- 
slaught upon that worthiest of educational 
philanthropies, the Carnegie Foundation, 
upon the ground, forsooth, that Mr. Carnegie 
does not choose to extend his benefaction to 
institutions that flout the very idea of a uni- 
versity by establishing sectarian tests for their 
teaching. The narrow-minded and reaction- 
ary temper of this outburst is almost in- 
credible, and is anything but becoming to an 
educational official in high position. Recently, 
also, Mr. Churchill delivered himself, at a pub- 
lic school reunion in New York, of an address 
from which we are constrained to make a few 
extracts. He began by telling the pathetic 
story of a boy who got into a high school in 
a slightly irregular way, and who could not 
be kept there, under the rules, until special 
action was taken in his case. But whence 
these tears ? The action was taken, and surely 
a system of high schools must have rules reg- 
ulating conditions of entrance. Next, he 
assails what he calls the "high school stand- 
ard," indulging in declamation about the 
schools being "for the people," and inveigh- 
ing against "the traditions of ancient aris- 
tocracy." This, of course, is the sheerest 
claptrap, and means, if it means anything, 
that children of a certain age must be passed 
through the high school, without regard to 
their acquirements, and in defiance of the 
fact that they are not yet qualified to be pro- 
moted from the lower grades. "Schools for 
the people" is a phrase meaning that suitable 
instruction is freely offered to every child; 
it emphatically does not mean that a child has 



a prescriptive right to be shoved along at the 
normal rate if through dulness or laziness he 
does not make the normal progress. Later, 
the author pays his respects to science, which 
in the schools has "been enacted into a list of 
sesquipedalian words and sentences as intel- 
ligible to the mind of an ordinary parent as 
the chatter of the jabberwock." Finally, in- 
voking the memories of 1776, the author in- 
dulges in a diatribe against what he calls the 
"monarchial regiment" [sic] in education, 
although it is hard to find out what he means 
by it. The trail of the demagogue is over 
every paragraph of this address, which no 
intelligent person can read without disgust, 
mingled with sorrow that its author should 
hold by the grace of politics the post of high- 
est authority in the school system of New 
York. 

The "Journal of Education," which prints 
the address, calls Mr. Churchill ' ' a live wire. ' ' 
The metaphor is well chosen, because a live 
wire may be a very dangerous thing. Un- 
fortunately, this particular wire is at loose 
ends, and is a menace to those who get within 
its reach. A live wire that is properly and 
safely circuited supplies the effective driving 
force that a school system needs, but the cur- 
rent should be promptly shut off from such 
a live wire as the President of the New York 
Board of Education. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 

JOURNALISTIC IDEALS commonly mean low 
and utilitarian or commercial ideals, and 
among the popular metropolitan journals 
that are usually regarded as not disinclined 
to sacrifice higher aims to less exalted motives 
has long been numbered the newspaper di- 
rected so brilliantly and for so many years 
by the commanding genius whose name is 
associated with our leading school for the 
training of journalists. Interesting, and not 
devoid of unintentional humor, are the fol- 
lowing extracts from an eloquent monologue 
uttered by Mr. Joseph Pulitzer a short time 
before his death, and reproduced by one of 
his secretaries in the book elsewhere reviewed 
in these pages. After asserting that "accu- 
racy is to a newspaper what virtue is to 
a woman," and that his daily instructions 
to his staff insist first and foremost upon accu- 
racy, Mr. Pulitzer continues : " I do not say 
that The World is the only paper which takes 
extraordinary pains to be accurate; on the 
contrary, I think that almost every paper in 



[July 16 



America tries to be accurate. I will go fur- 
ther than that. There is not a paper of any 
importance published in French, German or 
English, whether it is printed in Europe or 
in America, which I have not studied for weeks 
or months, and some of them I have read 
steadily for a quarter of a century; and I 
tell you this, Mr. Ireland, after years of expe- 
rience, after having comparisons made by 
the hundred, from time to time, of different 
versions of the same event, that the press 
of America as a whole has a higher standard 
of accuracy than the European press as a 
whole." The speaker's deliberate opinion is 
that "there are no newspapers in America 
which are so habitually, so criminally stuffed 
with fake news as the worst of the European 
papers." And further: "As a matter of 
fact, the criticisms you hear about the Amer- 
ican press are founded on a dislike for our 
headlines and for the prominence we give 
to crime, to corruption in office, and to sen- 
sational topics generally; the charge of inac- 
curacy is just thrown in to make it look 
worse. I do not believe that one person in 
a thousand who attacks the American press 
for being inaccurate has ever taken the trou- 
ble to investigate the facts. ' ' Even the charge 
of sensationalism, most shameful of literary 
crimes, is made to rest on a very frail founda- 
tion, if not altogether refuted. Is all this to 
be taken as highly encouraging and gratify- 
ing, or simply as one more illustration of the 
old maxim, quot homines, tot sententice, and 
of the equally ancient truth that men easily 
believe what they wish to believe? 


THE TRUTH ABOUT THE TOURGUENIEFF- TOL- 

STOI BREACH is told by Tolstoi's son, Count 
Ilya Tolstoi, in the current instalment of 
his reminiscences of his father, in the "Cen- 
tury Magazine." It is made clear that, con- 
trary to the prevalent notion, there was no 
literary rivalry or literary jealousy between 
the two men ; but there was perpetual discord 
between their temperaments. "Your whole 
being stretches out hands toward the future, ' ' 
writes the older to the younger man in 1856 ; 
' ' mine is built up in the past. For me to fol- 
low you is impossible. For you to follow me 
is equally out of the question. You are too 
far removed from me, and besides, you stand 
too firmly on your own legs to become any 
one's disciple. I can assure you that I never 
attributed any malice to you, never suspected 
you of any literary envy. I have often 
thought, if you will excuse the expression, 
that you were wanting in common sense, but 
never in goodness. You are too penetrating 
not to know that if either of us has cause 
to envy the other, it is certainly not you that 



has cause to envy me." But five years later 
there came what Tolstoi's son calls "a com- 
plete breach ' ' between the two friends, though 
its completeness was not such as to prevent 
exchange of courtesies and even an extension 
of hospitality on at least three occasions on 
the part of the "crank," as his friend re- 
garded him, who had secluded himself at 
Yasnaya Polyana. The case is well sum- 
marized by Count Ilya thus: "It seems to 
me that Tourguenieff, as an artist, saw nothing 
in my father beyond his great literary talent, 
and was unwilling to allow him the right to 
be anything besides an artist and a writer. 
Any other line of activity on my father's 
part offended Tourguenieff, as it were, and he 
was angry with my father because he did not 
follow his advice. He was much older than 
my father, he did not hesitate to rank his own 
talent lower than my father's, and demanded 
only one thing of him, that he should devote 
all the energies of his life to his literary 
work." But of course Tolstoi insisted on 
being something more than a literary artist, 
and so these two, each of whom protested that 
he had never had a serious disagreement with 
any one else, and each of whom earnestly de- 
sired the other's friendship, were utterly un- 
able to "hit it off " together. 



THE SUSTAINING POWER OF POETRY, in mo- 
ments of physical weakness and mental de- 
pression, has been attested more than once. 
In an eloquent passage of his writings Rob- 
ertson of Brighton describes the refreshment 
and reinvigoration that he derived from 
Shakespeare in times of weariness, and con- 
trasts this healthful stimulus with the baleful 
effects of those grosser medicaments resorted 
to by the slaves of alcohol or opium. Matthew 
Arnold's well-known sonnet, "To a Friend," 
beginning, "Who prop, thou ask'st, in these 
bad days, my mind?" gives high praise to 
Homer, " clearest-souled of men," but higher 
still to Sophocles, "who saw life steadily and 
saw it whole." During his recent recovery 
from a severe illness Senator Lodge had re- 
course to the poets of Greece and of England 
to build up again the weakened fabric of his 
inner life. He describes in "Diversions of a 
Convalescent," published in this month's 
"Scribner's Magazine," the solace and satis- 
faction he found in recalling certain familiar 
poems and parts of poems, and tells how his 
thoughts, "ranging at will through the wide 
spaces of memory, turned naturally and 
chiefly to Milton and Shakespeare, above all 
to the latter. Passages from 'Paradise Lost,' 
from 'Lycidas,' 'L 'Allegro,' 'II Penseroso,' 
the ' Samson Agonistes, ' and the ' Comus, ' and 
lines from the sonnets, came unbidden in the 



1914] 



THE DIAL 



41 



silences of such a time. They were only frag- 
ments, but there was an endless pleasure in 
trying to recite them, to see how far the con- 
valescent could go, and there was something 
infinitely soothing and satisfying in their 
noble beauty and in the mere perfection of 
the words and rhythm, ..." He reiterates 
that ''it was to Shakespeare, best known and 
best beloved, that the convalescent's mind 
turned most constantly. His words recurred 
unceasingly as the thoughts, effortless and un- 
fettered, flitted here and there. Passages 
from the plays, entire sonnets, repeated them- 
selves to the convalescent, some over and over 
again, always with a sense of peace and deep 
content." One is reminded of Carlyle, in the 
loneliness and feebleness of his last years, 
solacing himself with reading again the whole 

of Shakespeare. 



LlTERATUEE AS VIEWED BY ITS MAKERS has 

unquestionably its seamy side, comparable 
with that of the drama as contemplated from 
the stage and behind the scenes. When we 
give ourselves up to the sublimities of the 
' ' Divine Comedy ' ' we seldom think of its 
author as the man who, in more than a fig- 
urative sense, had descended into Hell (for 
it was in that character that the people were 
wont to regard him as they craned their necks 
to get a peep at him on the street) , and when 
we refresh ourselves with the delightful 
humor and pathos of "The Vicar of Wake- 
field" we forget the four weary years its 
author waited, in poverty and discouragement, 
for its publication. Goldsmith's ready pen 
and his dexterity as a compiler gave him but 
little satisfaction. "While you are nibbling 
about elegant phrases, I am obliged to write 
half a volume," he complained to his friend 
Cradock. In the letters of Edward Dowden 
now given to the world in two selective col- 
lections occur not a few expressions of dis- 
taste for the less pleasing part of his daily 
duties as a writer of books and as a lecturer 
on literature. For example, one of his let- 
ters closes thus: "I must end, and turn to 
may I say an infernal kind of work, writ- 
ing examination papers which will occupy 
me for several toilsome days. You at least 
have not to torture English literature into 
horrid little questions." And an earlier one 
has this passage: "My miscellaneous read- 
ing for my E. literature book sinks down into 
a Serbonian bog. You can fully appreciate 
the difficulty of getting at facts from Bede, 
or rather from 'Beowulf and 'CEedmon' on- 
wards, where much is uncertain and much 
obscure." Still again, referring to the same 
task, he moans: "The English literature has 
nearly crushed me out of existence." There 



is something almost Carlylean in his outcries 
against the difficulties of his literary task, 
though the entire removal of those difficulties 
would probably have left him as wretched as 
was Carlyle as soon as he had finished one 
book and while he was waiting for the impulse 
to begin another. The author, no less than 
the obscurest of his readers, looks before and 
after and pines for what is not, and for what 
by no possibility ever can be. 



WHY THE DESIRED BOOK IS NOT FORTH- 
COMING is a question that has puzzled and 
also irritated more public-library users than 
could easily be counted. With that tendency 
which we all show to base our generalizations 
on one or two striking instances, the disap- 
pointed applicant for a recent popular novel 
exclaims: "That's just the way; I never 
can get anything I want here," and he (or 
more often she) flings out of the library and 
slams the door in wrathful disgust or would 
slam it if it were not for its anti-slam attach- 
ment which cruelly denies one that solace. 
With a scrupulosity not found in every library 
report, the John Crerar librarian explains, 
in his current annual record of things done 
and things left undone, "the causes of fail- 
ures to supply books called for," as follows: 
"At bindery, 663; otherwise unavailable 
temporarily, mostly burned or stolen and not 
yet replaced, 49 ; in use by another reader, 
1,073; withdrawn from general circulation, 
39; not found on shelves, 548; errors of 
library assistants or records, 140; total, 
2,512. The total is 1.58 per cent of the total 
call slips presented. Excluding the first four 
causes as unavoidable, the avoidable failures 
were 0.43 per cent." This total of less than 
one-fiftieth of all the books called for is cred- 
itably small. The corresponding figures in a 
public library circulating fiction and other 
light literature would be considerably larger, 
probably too large to admit of publication 
with any great pride on the librarian's part. 
Among the minor problems daily confronting 
the public librarian, there is none more hope- 
less of solution than the problem of meeting 
promptly every demand for a popular book 
without overloading the library with extra 
copies that must speedily become so much use- 
less lumber. 



IMMORTAL CHARACTERS IN FICTION are not 
created by every novelist. Indeed, to the 
older novel-readers among us it sometimes 
seems as if no characters were now being 
created to compare in popularity and lon- 
gevity with the famous creations of Dickens 
and Scott and Thackeray. At the Boston 
Authors' Club it was asserted the other day 



42 



THE DIAL 



[ July 16 



that no modern romancer had yet arisen whose 
characters could be compared with those of 
these older novelists in respect to what may 
be called their lingering or haunting quality. 
Surely, if any recent writers have given to 
the world any Sam Wellers or Dominie Samp- 
sons or Becky Sharps, the world is not yet 
keenly conscious of the gift. And yet, among 
the younger novel-readers there are doubtless 
not a few who are far more familiar with the 
characters of Mr. Kipling's and Mr. Locke's 
and Mr. Arnold Bennett's books than with 
those of any writer so nearly mediaeval as 
must to them appear the great trio named 
above. Nevertheless, these other and later 
children of the romancer's imagination show 
little disposition to join the company of uni- 
versally-known fictitious characters, although 
exception might be made in favor of several 
that will occur to the reader. Mr. Dooley, 
though not exactly a personage out of a novel, 
has a fame that is more than national, as also 
have those juvenile favorites, Tom Sawyer 
and Huckleberry Finn; and it may be that 
Rebecca will not fade from memory with 
the passing of the buttercups. But no one can 
tell beforehand what names will get into the 
"Who's Who in Fiction" of half a century 
hence. ... 

HOW TO WIN THE IMMIGRANT, how to help 

him to feel at home in the new land, and how to 
open the way to his becoming a useful and 
loyal citizen, are questions that have deeply 
interested Mr. John Foster Carr, as is already 
known from his widely circulated "Guide to 
the United States for the Italian Immigrant," 
a manual translated, mutatis mutandis, into 
many tongues for the benefit of immigrants 
from many lands. A later work from the 
same hand, entitled "Immigrant and Li- 
brary," is primarily for the librarian who 
wishes to increase the usefulness of his library 
among the alien population of his neighbor- 
hood. This little book, too, has reference 
especially to the Italian immigrant, and its 
preliminary pages of general suggestion and 
advice are followed by classified lists of Italian 
books likely to meet the needs and desires of 
working-class Italians. As the writer well 
says, "we sometimes forget that no natural- 
ized citizen can ever be a good American 
unless he has first been a good Italian or Ger- 
man or Greek unless he has the reverent 
instinct of loyalty to the land of his birth. 
If he is to be a good American, we must give 
him some sufficient reason for respecting and 
loving our land. And how better than 
through the library can this country of ours 
be made alluring, accepted in love 1 Alluring 
certainly is the library's invitation to per- 



sonal progress and self-betterment, and in its 
friendly rooms are an American environment 
and the atmosphere of our spoken English." 
Among evidences that library work with those 
in whom Mr. Carr is interested is not thrown 
away may be cited the Boston Public Library's 
testimony that "children of foreign-born par- 
ents read a better class of books than their 
American brothers and sisters." The Immi- 
grant Education Society, of New York, pub- 
lishes Mr. Carr's useful manual, which is 
likely to meet with an increasing demand, if 
certain signs in the library field are not mis- 
leading. ... 

THE MODESTY OF GENIUS is one of its most 
pleasing traits when it is present, which it 
not always is. In our mental pictures of 
Dickens the quality of modest simplicity and 
utter absence of conceit or self-consciousness 
is, perhaps, not the most prominent feature, 
thanks to the stories that have come down to 
us of his jaunty appearance as a young man, 
and of preference for neckties of not the 
quietest hue and for other articles of personal 
adornment rather characteristic of the dandy. 
That we may have unwittingly done the great 
novelist a wrong seems to be indicated by a 
noteworthy passage from the pen of his son, 
Mr. Henry Fielding Dickens, K. C., who con- 
tributes "A Chat About Charles Dickens" to 
this month's "Harper's Magazine." He 
writes: "Now if I were asked what it was 
that had struck me most about my father I 
think I should unhesitatingly say that it was 
his extraordinary modesty. His nature was 
of the simplest; his absence of affectation or 
conceit surprising. When it is remembered 
how, at the age of twenty-four, he jumped to 
the very top of his profession and remained 
there to the end, no man could well have 
blamed him if he had shown some slight symp- 
toms of having had his head turned. I can 
emphatically assert, from my knowledge of 
him, that there was a total absence of any- 
thing of the kind." It may be objected that 
the members of a man's family are too near 
him to see him in the right perspective, and 
the objection is not without weight; but let 
us not forget the emphatic words of Carlyle 
upon hearing of Dickens 's death, "the good, 
the gentle, high-gifted, ever-friendly, noble 
Dickens ; every inch of him an honest man. ' ' 



THE LITERARY DIVERSIONS OF A PHYSICIAN 

sometimes succeed in securing a place in his 
affections not second to that held by the 
things of his profession. It is safe to say 
that Sir Thomas Browne, Dr. John Brown, 
Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, and Dr. S. Weir

Mitchell all took more satisfaction, in secret 
if not openly, in their success and fame as 
authors than in their reputation as prac- 
titioners of medicine. "What we accomplish 
with the left hand and at odd moments seems 
to bear more unmistakably the stamp of 
innate capacity or genius than that which with 
sedulous training and strenuous effort we 
achieve in our regular working hours and by 
the conscientious application of our best ener- 
gies. Dr. Christopher Johnston, who died in 
Baltimore at the end of last month, was the 
son of a physician and was himself educated 
to be a physician, and for eight years prac- 
ticed medicine in the city of his birth; but 
Oriental studies encroached increasingly on 
his time and attention, until finally he became 
known to the world as one of the most emi- 
nent Orientalists in this country and as a 
writer in his chosen department of learning, 
holding at the same time a professorship in 
this department at Johns Hopkins University. 
He wrote "Epistolary Literature of the As- 
syrians and Babylonians, ' ' which appeared in 
1896, and edited ten years later a work on 
"Ancient Empires of the East." Articles on 
Assyriology and Egyptology also came from 
his pen, and he gave assistance to Professor 
Paul Haupt in a new translation of the Bible 
issued some years ago in Germany. Dr. 
Johnston was born in Baltimore, Dec. 8, 1856, 
received his college education at the Univer- 
sity of Virginia, his medical training at the 
University of Maryland, studied and after- 
ward taught Semitics at Johns Hopkins, and 
rose to the dignity of a full professorship (in 
Oriental history and archaeology) in that uni- 
versity six years ago. 



THE QUESTION OF PUBLIC PENSIONS FOR 

AUTHORS, a question that some are trying to 
agitate in this country, has more than one 
aspect and is not the simplest problem imag- 
inable. Generally speaking, what interest in 
or acquaintance with literature can be claimed 
for our legislators or other government offi- 
cials who would be called upon to grant the 
proposed pensions? In Tennyson's day in 
England, as the London "Chronicle" has 
recently pointed out, there was no end of 
difficulty in getting suitable pensions for de- 
serving men of letters. "When the question of 
granting the author of "The Lady of Shalott" 
a pension of two hundred pounds was under 
consideration, there was a rival in the field 
in the person of Sheridan Knowles. Peel 
confessed his complete ignorance of both 
claimants. "What!" exclaimed Monckton 
Milnes, "have you never seen the name of 
Sheridan Knowles on a playbill?" "No." 



"And have you never read a poem of Tenny- 
son's?" "No." Milnes sent him "Locksley 
Hall" and "Ulysses" to peruse at his leisure, 
and the great statesman may or may not have 
done so; but, as all the world knows, Tenny- 
son was so fortunate as to get his pension. 
Knowles 's turn came later. Apparently it 
would have been all one to Peel whether the 
pension was asked for in the name of the 
greatest poet in the land or for the obscurest 
rhymester of Grub Street. 


ANOTHER BUSINESS MEN'S BRANCH LIBRARY, 
after the pattern of the highly successful 
pioneer institution of this kind at Newark,

City Hall, in the room formerly used by the 
now extinct board of aldermen. The library 
already has a good collection of such reference 
books, maps, atlases, and other works, as are 
needed for the equipment of the proposed 
branch, and as it is not at present intended 
to provide books for circulation there will be 
little expense involved in the installation of 
the new service. Dr. Edward M. Hartwell, 
secretary of the statistics department, is 
named as head of the City Hall Branch the

similar branch of its public library in its City

men's branch, as an essential part of the 
American public library, has come to stay and 
to grow. _________________ 

BY-PRODUCTS OF LITERARY 
ENDEAVOR. 

(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 
There are so many, in these days of Compulsory 
Education, who can write, after a fashion, that it 
is not surprising to find the poor author adven- 
turing upon paths unknown to his more stolid 
forefathers. The dignity of letters is only for the 
writer with a competence; the others have to 
scramble for what they can get, like schoolboys 
in a muddy field. And even your successful 
author, arrived at a pitch where he enjoys a more 
than comfortable income from his work, too often 
throws his dignity to the winds, scrambling with 
the rest for more, which, from the point of view 
of his less fortunate brother in art, cannot be 
held other than reprehensible. But what is a 
popular writer to do when editors pursue him 
with flattering proposals? It takes a mind of 
uncommon loftiness to refuse handsome offers of 
cash for work that is easy and affords an agree- 
able change. And so we find novelists of renown, 
both men and women, writing in the public press, 
no doubt for highly exorbitant fees, on subjects 
with which they are often very imperfectly 
acquainted. 

In fact, the less they know about their topic, it 
would seem, the more anxiously does the modern

editor crave their assistance. It has lately become 
the fashion with the more widely circulated of our 
London morning papers to select the most incon- 
gruous persons to act as reporters on their 
" Sports " page. Football, of course, is just now 
the popular craze, among a certain section of the 
public. We possess a whole class who follow the 
career of their favorites in the various leagues, or 
in the Cup Ties, with more than a feverish interest. 
Football, with these, is a religion: they are 
steeped in the terminology of the game: their 
reading, conversation, and thoughts appear all to 
be concentrated upon this one absorbing topic. 
And I suppose that the kindly editor of the 
London " Daily Mail " imagined that this intelli- 
gent section of his readers hungered for variety. 
Perhaps he reasoned that, being human, they must 
surely be getting tired of the uninspired stuff that 
was served up to them week after week by the 
common reporters. Or perhaps again he is a 
subtle humorist, delighting in the incongruous for 
its own sake. At any rate, for the last few 
months he has adopted the practice of employing 
as football reporter the Ignorant Celebrity. Some- 
times he entraps a lady novelist; sometimes a 
pillar of the Church. The one essential appears 
to be that the writer should know as little as 
possible of the game he has to describe. Whether 
the football enthusiast enjoys the curious sus- 
tenance that is dished up to him above these 
honored names I have no means of telling. I 
should conjecture that he takes his favorite pas- 
time too seriously to relish the change; probably 
he prefers the common man who knows his busi- 
ness to the more florid balderdash of the accom- 
plished word-spinner. On the other hand, the 
editor of this popular journal is assuredly a man 
who knows his public. He is aware that they like 
big names. And it is possible that his readers 
experience a pleasant sense of superiority when 
they discover that, after all, they know more about 
the intricacies of the Association code than Miss 
Marie Corelli or the Right Reverend the Bishop 
of Zanzibar. 

This pursuit of the Big Name is nothing new 
in British journalism: this latest development is 
merely a new phase of a practice that came into 
vogue toward the end of the last century. And 
there is something to be said for it. The opinion 
of the expert is very well, but now and again it is 
not amiss to have also the opinion of one who has 
earned his reputation in other fields. Thus we get 
a certain freshness of outlook; and freshness is 
an eminently desirable quality in a daily paper. 
A short time ago editors were all for securing the 
services of well-known players to write of the 
games in which they excelled. Professional crick- 
eters used to write of the matches in which they 
took part; commonly, it may be admitted, they 
made a very dull job of it. So, too, almost all 
our leading golfers perpetrated books of advice 
on their so popular pastime. Some of these dis- 
played a literary facility that confounded those 
critics who held that a certain torpidity of intellect 
was essential to the making of a first-class golfer. 
But there was, necessarily, a degree of sameness 
about their work: even the most enthusiastic of 



golfers began to get tired of reading similar advice, 
worded with a slight difference. And the point 
of view was always the same, the intensely 
serious outlook of the man to whom golf was a 
means of livelihood as well as a game. And so 
with cricket, and football, and the rest. It occurred 
to the powers who rule such things that perhaps 
the professional writer and preacher might infuse 
a little more spirit into the affair. And so they 
turned to the professional writer, the professional 
speaker, the artist in words and phrases, for a 
change. 

Our great lights in fiction took up the work 
readily enough. But I do not know that they 
made a great success of the business. Several 
novelists have tried their hands at football 
matches; a bishop or two, I believe, have written 
their impressions of other games in which the 
Church had, up to that time, taken but a languid 
interest. But any freshness that they might have 
brought to their task was nipped by a natural fear 
of displaying their ignorance. Indeed, in most 
cases, the journal that employed them thought it 
necessary to provide a journalistic nurse to coach 
them in their duties. Under the eye of this mentor 
the poor fellows were afraid to let their fancy 
have free play. The apologetic note was too much 
in evidence in their work; and their reports read 
very much like those of a new hand who had yet 
to learn the alphabet of his trade. Certainly the 
bishops contrived to introduce a few words of 
moral reflection; the lady novelists attempted a 
few generali ties ; the humorists did their best to 
insert an occasional joke. But I doubt if the 
experiment will be repeated when we come to 
another football season. 

The press of this country, very properly, does 
all it can to brighten its pages. Some years ago, 
we had the reputation of possessing the most solid 
daily press in the world. The solidity implied 
weight; and our morning papers secured their 
dignity at the cost of hard reading. Twenty years 
ago, or even less, the man who assimilated his 
" Times " in the morning felt as if he had already 
done a good day's work. As the general pace of 
life increased, it was felt that this daily labor 
imposed too great a task upon the nation; even 
the " Times " (most conservative of organs) had 
to modify its form and cast overboard some of its 
ancient lumber. It was about that time that the 
personal " causerie " began to take the place of 
the reasoned criticism. The art of writing in the 
press became the art of chatting pleasantly about 
personal predilections. Lightness and freshness of 
outlook were the two qualities most in demand. 
Young men were captured fresh from the uni- 
versities, or even earlier, and set to record their 
impressions of the latest performances in Litera- 
ture, Painting, Music, and the Drama. And at 
first, no doubt, they did infuse a certain amount 
of freshness into their task. But a very little 
experience of the critic's arm chair is sufficient to 
give the tyro all the airs of the expert; and in a 
very few weeks the young men were discovered 
to have picked up most of the outworn tags of 
their predecessors. But the manner, at any rate, 
was different ; and the manner has persisted. The

reviewer of to-day, with the critic of music and 
the drama, still commonly adopts the personal 
standpoint, which is a legacy from those earlier 
times. He does not go back to first principles. 
He has, in short, no standard by which to judge 
but that of his own sympathies. 

It is something for the young writer that he has 
no longer to mould his thoughts into the arbitrary 
form employed by the journalist of former days. 
He has a freer hand, both as to matter and manner. 
The old " leading article " of our youth had a 
framework of cast iron: it was a bed of Pro- 
crustes into which the writer had somehow to 
mould his thoughts, sometimes cutting them short 
but more often expanding them to the last degree 
of tenuity. Those three paragraphs, each about 
half a column in length, had to be filled; and the 
unhappy journalist, in self defence, fell insensibly 
into the habit of using the longest periphrases, a 
dozen words where two would serve. You could 
tell the accomplished leader-writer at a glance 
when he adventured into other fields of literary 
endeavor: there was apt to be something didactic 
and long-winded even in his conversation. He 
gained a fatal facility in the use of words; he 
became a machine for transforming every con- 
ceivable subject into articles in three paragraphs. 
I am glad to think that the leading article, in its 
old form, is practically dead. It could not be said 
to be good practice for the intending Man of 
Letters. 

I confess myself a believer in the notion of a 
writer trying as many fields as possible. It is a 
commonplace that the best masters of prose have 
in general been able to write fluent if not inspired 
verse. And journalism has given many of our 
greatest names to literature, from the times of 
Dickens and Thackeray to the present day. The 
practice of daily writing may or may not be 
useful; sometimes, no doubt, it makes for pro- 
lixity. But the journalist has to touch life at 
many points: he must have at the least a bowing 
acquaintance with all the activities of the moment; 
and this should have its use when he comes to the 
writing of novels. So that Mrs. Elinor Glyn and 
her sisters, who have recently paid occasional visits 
to the football field in the way of business, may 
possibly find inspiration for future works in the 
unaccustomed spectacle. In the meantime, their 
names have been advertised among a section of 
the public to whom, in all probability, their works 
had up to that time been but indifferently known. 

And so, too, with the stage. The masters of 
modern fiction adventure more and more into this 
province, and with increasing success. Mr. Arnold 
Bennett is the most popular playwright of the 
moment; Mr. G. K. Chesterton may be said to 
have won his spurs at the same innocent pursuit; 
Mr. Temple Thurston is another recruit who 
appears to be making his way toward the legiti- 
mate drama by way of the music-hall sketch. Of 
Sir James Barrie, and the other lights who have 
already illuminated the British stage, there is no 
need to speak now. But he, too, has been coquet- 
ting with the music-halls. And while some of our 
older dramatists have been occupying themselves 
in the designing of pageants, one novelist, Mr. 



Max Pemberton, has struck out a new line for 
himself by turning out those curious medleys, so 
popular here of late, which we call Revues. And 
his industry has contributed not a little to the 
brightness of these strange productions. There 
are rumors of other novelists following his 
example. The more the barriers are broken down 
in this and other directions the better. I do not 
know that the profession of novelist can be said 
to be decaying, but it is certainly somewhat incon- 
veniently over-crowded in these days.

LAMAE FONTAINE AND "ALL QUIET ALONG 
THE POTOMAC." 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
The bare statement in a recent book, " Writers 
and Writings of Texas," that Lamar Fontaine was 
the author of the poem, "All Quiet along the 
Potomac," calls to mind one of the most pic- 
turesque figures in American literature and a lit- 
erary controversy that was bitterly waged by the 
press during the seventies and eighties. 

Fontaine was born, October 10, 1829, in Laberde 
Prairie, Washington County, Texas. In 1840 his 
family moved to Austin, then the capital of the 
Republic, where his father served first as private 
secretary to President Lamar (for whom Fontaine 
was named), and later as pastor of the Episcopal 
church. The remainder of Fontaine's life reads 
like pure fiction, and is rivalled in interest only 
by the adventurous life of Captain John Smith. 
Shortly after his arrival at Austin he was cap- 
tured by the Comanche Indians, who kept him a 
prisoner for four years. Escaping by a clever 
subterfuge, he returned on foot to Austin, a dis- 
tance of seven hundred and fifty miles. After six 
years in the U. S. Navy, under the instruction of 
Lieutenant Matthew Fontaine Maury, he went to 
Russia, where he entered the Russian army. Dur- 
ing the siege of Sebastopol, by his expert marks- 
manship, he attracted the attention of the Czar, 
who bestowed on him the Iron Cross of Peter the 
Great. From Russia Fontaine journeyed to South 
America, and was there working as a civil engineer 
when the Civil War broke out. He sailed imme- 
diately for the South and enlisted in the Confed^ 
erate army, acting for two years as a scout for 
Stonewall Jackson and later as a courier for Pem- 
berton and Johnston. At the siege of Vicksburg 
Fontaine distinguished himself by penetrating the 
Union lines on crutches and entering the city with 
important dispatches and 40,000 gun caps. Alto- 
gether he took part in twenty-seven battles and 
fifty-seven skirmishes, and was wounded sixty- 
seven times ! After the war and until his death in 
Augusta, Georgia, he supported himself by teach- 
ing and surveying. 

The poem which is responsible for Fontaine's 
literary prominence appeared anonymously in 
" Harper's Weekly " for November 30, 1861, under 



46

the title, " The Picket." His claim to its author- 
ship was not long uncontested. Mrs. Ethel Beers, 
the only other contestant who gained much con- 
sideration, died on the very day (October 10, 1879) 
on which her only volume of poetry, "All Quiet 
along the Potomac, and Other Poems," appeared. 
This volume did much to strengthen her claim. 

She has been favored, too, by most authorities. 
Thus Appleton's " Cyclopaedia of American Biog- 
raphy " remarks : " Her most noted poem is 'All 
Quiet along the Potomac/ suggested by an oft- 
repeated dispatch during the first year of the 
Civil War. Its authorship was warmly disputed; 
but, as is usual in such cases, only one of the 
claimants had written other verses of equal merit. 
That was Mrs. Beers, and there is now no further 
doubt as to the genuineness of her title." The 
poem had appeared under her name without com- 
ment in W. C. Bryant's "Library of Poetry and 
Song " in 1871. Even Southern reference books 
have usually made cautious statements. " The 
South in the Building of the Nation," to quote an 
instance, remarks: " Fontaine claimed the author- 
ship of ' All Quiet along the Potomac,' but 
his claims seem not to be firmly established " ; 
while C. W. Raines's " Bibliography of Texas " 
(p. 84) declares: "Mr. F., one of the claimants 
to the authorship of this celebrated poem, was a 
man of but little literary ability . . . and a school- 
teacher of scant qualifications. He has many cer- 
tificates of respectable men to sustain his claim, 
but the internal evidence is lacking." 

As early as 1869, however, when the controversy 
between Mrs. Beers and Fontaine was just begin- 
ning, the poem was published under Fontaine's 
name in " The Southern Poems of the War " 
(collected and arranged by Miss Emily V. Mason, 
of Virginia) and in " The Southern Amaranth " 
(by Miss Sallie A. Brock), with notes alluding 
to the controversy and sustaining Fontaine's claim. 
In this year, also, James Wood Davidson compiled 
his " Living Writers of the South," in which he 
credited the poem to Fontaine, justifying his act 
by publishing letters from Fontaine and various 
other Confederate officers. This evidence is 
strengthened by several other letters in Sam H. 
Dixon's "Poets and Poetry of Texas" (1885), a 
quaint old book, long out of circulation. The most 
interesting of these is a letter from Fontaine, dated 
June 24, 1885. 

Fontaine begins by telling of his friendship with 
a Mr. Moore, a member of his own company, with 
whom, " because we were of the same tempera- 
ment, and exceedingly fond of poetry," he usually 
contrived to stay, even while on picket duty. On 
August 2, 1861, he goes on to say, he and Moore 
were hailed by a Federal picket, who invited them 
to come half way to exchange papers. Fontaine 
swam across to the island, "put on one of the 
overcoats of the guard, and ate a hearty meal, and 
made arrangements with the entire post that we 
would not fire at one another while on guard." 
He then returned to the Confederate lines. " We 
had to stand on post six hours at a time," he con- 
tinues. " That night I took my stand at six and 
Moore retired to rest. ... As soon as I found 
that midnight had arrived I stepped to the fire 



and threw on some pine knots, and roused Moore 
to take my place. He rose slowly and gathered 
his gun and stepped to the fire, stretching himself, 
as a sleepy soldier will, and gaped and yawned; 
and while his arms were extended, and his hand 
grasped the barrel of his gun, there was a flash 
across the river and the whiz of a bullet, and he 
sank to the earth, with a hole just above his eye 
on the left side. . . . Not a word, not a groan 
escaped him. I removed his remains from near 
the fire where he had fallen. As I did so my eyes 
fell on the telegraphic columns of a newspaper, 
and it was headed 'All Quiet along the Potomac 
To-night.' And, oh, how truthful it was. . . . 
When morning dawned the words of that news- 
paper were burned in my brain they rang in 
my ears, and were painted on every scene that met 
my view. . . . And while I stood and gazed at his 
marble face and glazed eyes ... I felt what few 
mortals ever feel in this shadowy vale. I penned 
the outlines of the poem then and there, but not 
as they now appear, for the first were biting and 
sarcastic. I read the crude copy to Mr. W. W. 
Williams, and to Graham and Deprist. And Mr. 
Williams suggested that if I would only make it 
pathetic, instead of sarcastic, it would be better. 
I did so, and on the 9th of August I had it com- 
plete, as the poem now stands, and I read it to my 
messmates . . . and gave them copies of the orig- 
inal, and they recopied and sent them home, and 
soon the whole regiment, brigade, division, and 
army were in possession of it." 

Mrs. Beers claims to have written the poem on 
a " cool September morning, after reading the 
stereotyped announcement, 'All Quiet,' etc., to 
which was added in small type, 'A Picket Shot.' " 
But it is obvious that Fontaine's account of why 
he wrote the poem is the more plausible and could 
better explain its deep emotion. In regard to 
Mrs. Beers, he wrote in the letter mentioned above : 
" Does it seem possible to a reading public that a 
woman unacquainted and unused to the scenes and 
incidents of war should be able to portray so good 
and so true a picture, and she a thousand miles 
from the spot? or how a Northern woman could 
write a poem so truly Southern, when the most 
intense and bitter animosity existed between the 
two sections, and a cruel, bloody war was raging 
at the time? It passes all comprehension. And if 
she could do such a thing, she would be the most 
remarkable woman on the face of the earth." 

Fontaine, it should be remembered, wrote other 
poems: his war songs are excellent, notably 
"Oenone," "Only a Soldier," and "Dying Pris- 
oner at Camp Chase." For these he deserves some 
attention, even if his claim to "All Quiet along 
the Potomac " be not recognized. Regardless of 
who wrote the poem, it is interesting to read J. W. 
Davidson's dictum that it will be remembered " as 
long as hostile hosts send sorrow over civilized 
country as long as bloody death in distant lands 
breaks loving hearts at home " ; and Dixon's state- 
ment : " This poem stands among the finest lyrics 
of the English language. It made the name of its 
author familiar to the world. Its popularity does 
not grow less as tune passes. ... It will be appreci- 
ated as long as the memory of battle's fierce con-

" GBOCEE-SHOP CBITICISM." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I am one of those who would like to make 
" excited protests against the very idea of there 
being such things in criticism as standard weights, 
standard scales, and competent literary grocers," 
but Mr. Ford Madox Hueffer offers me a chance 
to do something better. He. explains, in the cur- 
rent issue of " Poetry and Drama," the difference 
between non-impressionist writing which is what 
you defend in your article on " Grocer-Shop Criti- 
cism " and impressionist writing : 

" The difference between the description of a grass 
by the agricultural correspondent of the Times news- 
paper and the description of the same grass by Mr. 
W. H. Hudson is just the difference the measure 
of the difference between the egos of the two gentle- 
men. The difference between the description of any 
given book by a sound English reviewer and the 
description of the same book by some foreigner 
attempting Impressionist criticism is again merely a 
'matter of the difference in the ego. 

" Mind, I am not saying that the non-Impressionist 
productions may not have their values their very 
great values. The Impressionist gives you his own 
views, expecting you to draw deductions, since pre- 
sumably you know the sort of chap he is. The agri- 
cultural correspondent of the Times, on the other 
hand and a jolly good writer he is attempts to 
give you, not so much his own impressions of a new 
grass as the factual observations of himself and of as 
many as possible other sound authorities. He will 
tell you how many blades of the new grass will grow 
upon an acre, what height they will attain, what will 
be a reasonable tonnage to expect when green, when 
sun-dried in the form of hay or as ensilage. He will 
tell you the fattening value of the new fodder in its 
various forms and the nitrogenous value of the manure 
dropped by the so-fattened beasts. He will provide 
you, in short, with reading that is quite interesting 
to the layman, since all facts are interesting to men 
of good will; and the agriculturist he will provide 
with information of real value. Mr. Hudson, on the 
other hand, will give you nothing but the pleasure of 
coming in contact with his temperament, and I doubt 
whether, if you read with the greatest care his descrip- 
tion of false sea-buckthorn (MppopJice rhamnoides) 
you would very willingly recognize that greenish-gray 
plant, with the spines and the berries like reddish 
amber, if you came across it. 

" Or again so at least I was informed by an 
editor the other day the business of a sound English 
reviewer is to make the readers of the paper under- 
stand exactly what sort of book it is that the reviewer 
is writing about. . . . What the sound English re- 
viewer, therefore, has to do is to identify himself with 
the point of view of as large a number of readers of 
the journal for which he may be reviewing, as he can 
easily do, and then to give them as many facts about 
the book under consideration as his allotted space will 
hold. To do this he must sacrifice his personality and 
the greater part of his readability. But he will prob- 
ably very much help his editor, since the great majority 
of readers do not want to read anything that any 
reasonable person would want to read: and they do 



not want to come into contact with the personality of 
the critic, since they have obviously never been intro- 
duced to him. 

" The ideal critic, on the other hand as opposed 
to the so-exemplary reviewer is a person who can 
so handle words that from the first three phrases any 
intelligent person any foreigner, that is to say, and 
any one of three inhabitants of these islands any 
intelligent person will know at once the sort of chap 
he is dealing with. Letters of introduction will there- 
fore be unnecessary, and the intelligent reader will 
know pretty well what sort of book the fellow is 
writing about because he will know the sort of fellow 
the fellow is. ... " 

Does not Mr. Hueffer succeed in demonstrating that 
the difference between the non-impressionist writer 
and the impressionist writer is the difference 
between a carpenter and a Sheraton or a Chip- 
pendale ? 

Seriously, I recognize the necessity of the criti- 
cism which makes it a business to list, describe, and 
" place " books : or, as THE DIAL puts it, " to 
estimate literature, to pass judgment upon it, to 
register the facts about it in some sort of objective 
fashion." But that sort of criticism interests me 
as a reader very little. It is useful to those who 
have a use for it. The other sort (the sort that 
Mr. George Moore has written in his autobiog- 
raphy, that M. Anatole France puts into his novels, 
even that which Mr. Hueffer has put into his 
"Memories and Impressions") is interesting to 
those who have an interest for it. LAURA TOBEY.

" HEAET OF HEAET." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
In connection with your remarks about "Tempta- 
tions to Misquotation" (June 16), under which 
you refer to Hamlet's "heart of heart," it is per- 
haps worth recalling that Wordsworth uses " heart 
of hearts " in the last stanza of his ode, " Intima- 
tions of Immortality." 
" And 0, ye Fountains, Meadows, Hills and 

Groves, 

Forebode not any severing of our loves ! 
Yet in my heart of hearts I feel your might." 
May not some instances of supposed "misquo- 
tation" be really a borrowing from Wordsworth?

THE USE OF " TEMPEST." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
I have just read the article in your issue for 
May 16 on dialectic English. The word tempest 
recalls the surprise I felt at the beginning of three 
years' residence on Cape Cod to hear the word 
used commonly as an exact synonym for thunder- 
storm. 

Persnickety I have been accustomed to use in 
the sense attached to perjinkety, that is, over-fas- 
tidious. I do not know how the word was acquired 
or how common its use is.

EDWARD DOWDEN'S MESTD AXtD ART.* 



A pleasing self-delineation of the Irish critic 
and poet whose first book, " Shakespeare, his 
Mind and Art, ' ' made him widely known as a 
gifted writer and a discerning interpreter of 
other men 's writings, is to be found in the two 
collections of letters issued under the super- 
vision of his widow and one of his daughters. 
"Letters of Edward Dowden and His Corre- 
spondents " is prefaced with a brief editorial 
note signed by Mrs. Dowden and Miss Hilda 
M. Dowden, and with a longer critical and 
appreciative introduction by Mr. W. K. Magee 
("John Eglinton"). "Fragments from Old 
Letters. E. D. to E. D. "W. 1869-1892 " is 
edited by Mrs. Dowden alone, the "E. D. W." 
referred to on the title page, or, in full, the 
Elizabeth Dickinson West who became Dow- 
den 's second wife in 1895, and who is a daugh- 
ter of the late Dean of St. Patrick's. The Jtwo 
volumes appeared almost simultaneously, and 
together constitute one work, the tone of all 
the letters being predominantly though by no 
means exclusively literary and critical, often 
rich in book-learning, and always kindly and, 
as one instinctively feels, agreeably charac- 
teristic of the writer. This, of course, applies 
to the letters from Dowden, which make up 
all one volume and the greater part of the 
other. 

There is something rather touching and 
wholly ingratiating in Dowden 's lifelong de- 
sire to give the best expression of himself in 
poetry of his own rather than, as he was 
destined to do, in appraising and interpreting 
the poetry of others. In his college days at 
Dublin University he won, among other 
honors, the vice-chancellor's prize for both 
English verse and prose, and the little book 
of poems he published at the age of thirty-one 
was so far successful as to go into a second 
edition. But if he did not win immortal fame 
as a poet, it was the poet in him that helped 
to make him one of the soundest and most 
stimulating of critics and one of the most 
enjoyable of essayists." As Mr. Magee says of 
him in the preface already referred to, 

" The poet in Dowden was the secret of his per- 
sonal distinction; it was the secret also of that 
strange humility of his, for he hardly valued him- 
self at all on the possession of those faculties for 
which the world in his case found most use: his 
aptitude for mere book-learning, for instance, of 
which he says in his letters, ' Somehow I have

acquired a lot of wholly useless knowledge and can't 
get rid of it.' The creative faculty was what he 
valued; and his instinct for recognising it, which 
enabled him to contribute to literature so large a 
body of most helpful criticism, was derived from 
the poet in himself." 

Continuing his comment, the writer speaks 
of the artistic detachment, the objectivity, the 
lack of the personal element and of expres- 
sions of personal preference in Dowden 's work 
as a literary critic ; and he likens his method 
to that of Sainte-Beuve in French criticism, 
ascribing to him the highest credit for his 
interpretation of Shakespeare. Then, in a 
passage that excellently characterizes the cor- 
respondence here under review, he adds : 

" It is this missing personal element in his writ- 
ings which the present collection of letters comes to 
supply ; and the mere fact that so many of his cor- 
respondents, from his earliest years, preserved his 
letters, is already a sort of credential of their inter- 
est and value. The writing of letters was at all 
times with him one of his principal relaxations. He 
seemed always ready for it, and wherever he hap- 
pened to be in the Examination Hall of Trinity 
College, or lying out on the grass, or in the midst of 
his family he would pull out his fountain-pen, 
and in that beautiful handwriting welcomed by his 
correspondents all over the world, would give the 
piece of advice solicited, find what he could say in 
praise of some MS., supply a fact in literary his- 
tory, or gossip about himself, his literary, profes- 
sorial, political activities, with the same blending of 
irony and sympathy with which he looked on at life 
and the world. It was almost his chosen mode of 
intercourse with his friends, as he admits playfully 
to the friend to whom he wrote his best letters : 
' It is satisfactory to be at writing distance. It is 
only now and then I am friendly to you in bodily 
presence. However, you are aware that under my 
talk of the weather there is something more real. 
But on paper I can even talk of " two new points 
in Hamlet's soul " (much better than the weather) .' 
The personality which presents itself in these letters 
is that almost of a saint of culture: a saint, how- 
ever, not lost to humanity, nor whom celestial diet 
has spoiled for human nature's daily food ; for they 
are a record of a life passed with the great person- 
alities of literature." 

The preface here quoted from is a little con- 
fusing and self-contradictory in professing to 
find in Dowden 's critical work, which in a 
general way includes all his prose work, "an 
entire elimination of his own personality," 
and in asserting at the end that "his con- 
tribution to Irish literature was perhaps the 
greatest he could have made, a personality." 
It was in keeping with this very impersonality 
of his that he could humorously call himself 
"a half-breed Irishman" and one endowed 
"with none of the instincts of Irish nation- 
ality. ' ' He refused to join in the Irish literary 
movement that vainly sought his support in

the early nineties ; his interest was in a larger 
literary movement, and it is this very breadth 
of literary sympathy that has given him so 
wide an influence in the world of letters. 

And now for a few illustrative extracts from 
the correspondence itself. Here is one that 
combines the intimate and personal with the 
literary and critical in a delightful manner. 
It is from a letter written in the country to 
Mr. Magee ; the date, August 12, 1895. 

" If you are, as I suppose, gone away for your 
holiday, I hope you have better weather than ours. 
It has resulted for me in a stupefying dose of read- 
ing. I am just now finishing a long poem by 
Mr. Milton called ' Paradise Lost,' which I am sure 
you have heard of, perhaps read. Mark Pattison 
deplores Milton's prostitution in pamphlet writing. 
I confess I sometimes turn from the addresses of 
the Almighty to his Son, and vice versa, with some 
satisfaction to the rages and arguments on divorce 
and king-killing and prelate-harrying; and I like 
to see how the poet behaved in the stress of the 
realities of his day." 

Writing in term time from Dublin to Ed- 
mund Gosse, Dowden gives a glimpse of him- 
self in the class-room. He is at his epistolary 
best in such light and humorous passages as 
this: 

" Last Friday I went into my class-room with a 
delightful new lecture copied out of a certain new 
volume by E. G., which lecture I purposed to 
deliver with a critical air and an impressive aspect 
of original investigation, as the lecturer's own. 
Imagine my disgust when I saw ' Seventeenth Cen- 
tury Studies ' already in the hands of one of my 
students. I made a vain attempt to turn him out of 
my class-room for breach of discipline. Then I 
humbled myself and said, ' I will now read some 
extracts from a charming essay on Herrick, by 
Mr. Gosse, which I am proud to see is already 
known to members of my class.' The young offender 
felt touched by this, and did not mention the fact 
that I read nearly the whole essay." 

Dowden 's long friendship with the woman 
whom, three years after the death of his first 
wife, he married, and by whom the last years 
of his life were cheered, is commemorated in 
the smaller of the two volumes here under 
notice. The letters begin in the spring of 
1869, and end in the autumn of 1892. The 
marriage, after which the two "were never a 
day apart until April 3, 1913," took place in 
December of 1895. To judge from the letters 
and parts of letters published, it was chiefly 
what may be called a literary and intellectual 
friendship that finally took on a warmer glow 
and ended in matrimony, and it is because 
the letters are devoted so largely to the 
writer's studies and literary diversions that 
they are of sufficient general interest to be 
made public. Here is a part of one written 
in 1874, when the writer was nearing the end 
of his thirty -first year. 



" I do n't know what my lecture on the ' Humour 
of Shakespeare' will turn out, except that I have 
no intention of being funny. I conjecture before- 
hand that not only a man's laughter is significant, 
but the history of his laughter, and I think if I 
arrange Shakespeare's plays in chronological order, 
and ask what Shakespeare laughed at from 26 to 40, 
something ought to be discoverable. The wit of the 
early comedies is something very remote from the 
sublime and pathetic grotesque of Lear's fool. . . . 
As to Shakespeare's humour, I think there is a tem- 
porary and a permanent element (permanent at 
least as long as we have the sense of humour) in it. 
I have rarely laughed aloud when reading 
Shakespeare, but not so much at anything exactly 
humorous as at something else, probably sympathy 
with Shakespeare's delight in inventing anything so 
much after his own heart. I think in heaven we 
shall have something corresponding to humour, the 
relative will still remain, and perhaps the highest 
heroisms we can now conceive will appear then like 
the efforts of a baby to think or speak or move, and 
as we smile with a half pleased, half tender, and 
wholly loving feeling at the upward tendings of a 
baby, so we shall have a tender, half -amused joy in 
the striving after right of souls in their childhood, 
and we shall afford the same recreation to the 
Greater Spirits who are above ourselves." 

The poetic gift of his correspondent quick- 
ened the interest Dowden evidently felt in her 
from the first. He gives her useful advice 
about writing and publishing, and from time 
to time commends her work in prose and verse. 
Referring to her literary manner, he says, in 
a passage that no one who plies a pen will 
fail to enjoy: 

"As to what I said of style I mean not that you 
have applied the manipulative dexterities of a 
craftsman to your sentences but that you see and 
feel what ought to be done, and do it ; and one gets 
the pleasure from such writing that one gets from 
the swift work of an artist who tells a truth with 
every touch. The manipulative dexterities I am 
far from despising." 

This mention of " the manipulative dexteri- 
ties " recalls what a reviewer in "The Spec- 
tator" said of Dowden 's style upon the ap- 
pearance of his "Transcripts and Studies." 
In a criticism of the book the writer was of 
opinion that ' ' occasionally Mr. Dowden allows 
the wealth of decorative language of which he 
is a master to get the better of him and serve 
as a substitute for thought; but this is not 
often, and for the most part his criticism is as 
thoughtful as it is happily expressed." 

Happily expressed thoughts abound in 
these collections of letters; and though all 
parts are not equally interesting to all read- 
ers, no reader who feels moved to open the 
volumes should fail to find much matter suited 
to his tastes, and none that is utterly devoid 
of savor. Portraits, views, and facsimiles are 
included. PERCY F. BICKNELL.

ENGLISH DRAMA OF THE ITTH AND ISTH 
CENTURIES.* 



With all the attention which colleges have 
given in the past few years to dramatic 
studies, it is strange that no serious history 
of the English drama of the last two cen- 
turies should have appeared. Dr. Ward's 
standard work carries the story only to the 
death of Queen Anne; Professor Schelling 
confines himself to the Elizabethan period. 
Professor Nettleton's "English Drama of the 
Restoration and Eighteenth Century" is in- 
tended to supply this lack in part; and a 
sequel which will deal with the nineteenth 
century is promised. 

The present study is dedicated to Dr. Ward, 
and has had the benefit of his advice and sug- 
gestions. For the sake of completeness and 
continuity, Professor Nettleton has wisely 
included the Restoration, and has given a 
resume of the scattering dramatic activities 
of the Puritan period. The volume ends with 
a discussion of Sheridan. Considering the 
difficulties of the task and the rather narrow 
limits of space, the book is in many respects 
excellent. It is based on a thorough study of 
the plays; it is logically planned and well 
proportioned; in statement of fact it is 
cautious and so far as it has been tested accu- 
rate. Its literary judgments, if a trifle con- 
ventional, are generally sound. The history is 
carefully integrated, every writer being con- 
sidered with reference to his predecessors and 
his followers. Thus, for instance, we are 
made to see how the origin of sentimental 
comedy may be traced to the sentimentalized 
tragedy of Otway and Southerne; or more 
specifically, how Goldsmith and Sheridan 
took hints for their great comedies from 
Wycherley, Farquhar, Steele, and Foote. 
There is a good, though rather scanty, work- 
ing bibliography, and a fairly satisfactory 
index. 

The chief faults are sins of omission. Pro- 
fessor Nettleton pays astonishingly little at- 
tention to stage conditions and dramatic 
technique. The differences between the Eliza- 
bethan theatre and that of the Restoration 
are stated only briefly; the evolution of the 
Restoration stage into the modern stage is 
entirely ignored. The word "stage" does 
not appear in the index; the word "theatre" 
appears only with reference to Drury Lane. 
In the chapters on the Garrick era especially 
we feel the need of some account of the rival 
theatres and companies ; and indeed the value 
of the whole book would be greatly increased 
by a brief chronological view of the theatres

CENTURY (1642-1780). By George Henry Nettleton. New 
York : The Macmillan Co. 



and their history. In the same way the de- 
velopment of dramatic technique is almost 
ignored, except in so far as it is connected 
with the controversy about the rules. We 
get only a hint of the decisive influence of 
new stage conditions on technique. So simple 
a matter as the introduction of the curtain, 
for instance, had an important effect upon 
the construction of plays. The author's 
naivete in this whole matter may be sug- 
gested by a single sentence. "Like Gold- 
smith," he says, "Sheridan prefers 'expec- 
tation' to 'surprise' as a dramatic motive." 
Yes: and he might have added, like Sopho- 
cles, like Shakespeare, and like every other 
dramatist who knew his business. 

Aside from these capital omissions, the 
chief weakness of the book is an occasional 
woodenness or vagueness of style. Certain 
mechanical tricks, such as the constant quali- 
fication of a sentence by its successor begin- 
ning with "yet," become distinctly annoying. 
As to vagueness, just what does this mean? 
"The Law against Lovers (1662) blends with 
the darker tones of Measure for Measure the 
lively accents of Benedick and Beatrice." Or 
what degree of indebtedness is implied in the 
remark that "The Parson's Wedding" "drew 
from Calderon"? But these are minor de- 
fects. Some day, it is to be hoped, Professor 
Nettleton may enlarge his book and give ade- 
quate treatment to the parts of the subject 
which he has slighted ; meanwhile we must be 
grateful to him for a good working text, in- 
valuable to students of the period.

MAX'S ORIGINAL, MENTAL, EQUIPMENT. 



"The Original Nature of Man" is the first 
volume of a trilogy by Mr. Edward L. Thorn- 
dike, professor of educational psychology at 
Columbia. It "describes man's original men- 
tal equipment the inherited foundations of 
intellect, morals, and skill." Of its mates, 
"The Psychology of Learning," which is the 
second, has still to be written ; while the third, 
on "Individual Differences and their Causes," 
was printed as long ago as 1903, under the 
title, "Educational Psychology." The pur- 
pose of this trilogy is to offer "a systematic 
account of present knowledge of the dynamics 
of human nature and behavior," not, how- 
ever, for the sake of knowledge, but for the 
sake of the improvement of mankind. Mr. 
Thorndike appears as a sort of American 
Socrates, applying the methods of the

''science" of psychology, in obedience to the 
maxim ' ' Know thyself. ' ' His conclusion is no 
less Socratic and triumphantly common- 
place. There is a higher and a lower in 
human nature. For happiness and civiliza- 
tion it is necessary that the lower shall be 
controlled by the higher. The instrument of 
control is education. Plato said the same 
thing, not less eloquently, if more gracefully 
and convincingly, in the "Republic" and 
elsewhere. But he wasn't so sure as Mr. 
Thorndike that the thing could be done: the 
American parts company with the Greek in 
his optimism. Mr. Thorndike 's tone, indeed, 
makes his book completely national. If psy- 
chology can be American, his is American 
psychology. 

Notwithstanding, he says in his easy, breezy, 
sometimes staccato manner, many striking and 
important things, which are not the less worth 
repeating because they are the immemorial 
wisdom of the fathers gaberdined in the slang 
of a latter-day science. Instead of a tripartite 
morally qualified soul, original nature is now 
conceived as a multiform congeries of func- 
tions "a name for the nature of the com- 
bined germ-cells from which man springs ' ' 
" what is common to all men minus all adapta- 
tions to tools, houses, clothes, furniture, words, 
beliefs, religions, law, science, the arts, and to 
whatever in other men's behavior is due to adapta- 
tions to it. ... Consider the intellectual and moral 
equipment of the monkeys. Add to it certain im- 
portant social instincts, notably those connected 
with the more refined facial expressions and the 
approval-disapproval series. Increase in intensity 
and breadth the satisfyingness of mental life for 
its own sake, widen the repertory of movements to 
include human facial expressions, finger and thumb 
play and articulate babble, enrich the fund of 
indifferent possibilities of secondary connections 
and give them the tendency to piecemeal action in 
very fine detail. The result will be substantially 
the original nature of man." 

This "original nature" Mr. Thorndike ren- 
ders concrete and specific by means of a de- 
scriptive inventory of instincts and capacities. 
Their origin is "original nature." Its im- 
provement depends on the elimination of the 
worse, not on their reformation. Containing 
within itself a principle of change, "the cir- 
cumstances of the life led by modern man 
metamorphose almost every original tendency 
into habits which are much unlike it even 
directly contrary to it." This is education 
"fostering the good elements of original 
nature and encouraging their fertility, and 
debarring the worse elements from reproduc- 
tion or eliminating them outright." The in- 
struments of this education are satisfaction 
and discomfort. These are infallible. Left 
to itself, original nature would run amuck. 



" The original tendencies of man have not been 
right, are not right, and probably never will be 
right. By them alone few of the best wants in 
human life would have been felt, and fewer still 
satisfied. Nor would the crude, conflicting perilous 
wants which original nature so largely represents 
and serves, have had much more fulfilment. Orig- 
inal nature has achieved what goodness the world 
knows as a state achieves order, by killing, con- 
fining and reforming some of its elements. It 
progresses, not by laissez faire, but by changing 
the environment in which it operates and by renew- 
edly changing itself in each generation. Man is 
now as civilized, rational, and humane as he is 
because man in the past has changed things into 
shapes more satisfying, and changed parts of his 
own nature into traits more satisfying, to man as 
a whole. Man is thus eternally altering himself to 
suit himself. His nature is not right in his own 
eyes. Only one thing in it, indeed is unreservedly 
good, the power to make it better. This power, 
the power of leaning or modification in favor of 
the satisfying, the capacity represented by the law 
of effect, is the essential principle of reason or 
right in the world." 

Familiar doctrine, age-old wisdom! But 
Mr. Thorndike does a great service to state it 
anew, and so freshly, as an offering to just 
those folk among whom pedantry is most 
prevalent and vision most needed, the Lapu- 
tan professors who are making a mess of the 
youth of the land with their "science" of 
"education" and "pedagogy." Written 
ostensibly for these, the book must by virtue 
of its robustious optimism no less than its 
sanity and fluency perforce appeal to all cul- 
tivated readers.

A GALLERY OF CONFEDERATE 
PORTRAITS.* 



One of the curious things in recent histor- 
ical writing is the amount of time and energy 
that Mr. Gamaliel Bradford, a northern man, 
has given to Confederate history. But there 
is nothing strange in the fact that any man, 
living anywhere, should think General Lee 
worthy of study ; and perhaps it was his pro- 
found study of this man which led Mr. Brad- 
ford to draw the portraits of the lesser lights 
by which Lee was surrounded. Eight men are 
considered in Mr. Bradford's new volume 
of "Confederate Portraits," beginning with 
Joseph E. Johnston and ending with Raphael 
Semmes. 

These papers, which first appeared as mag- 
azine articles, are not mere sketches, nor are 
they condensed biographies. They are exactly 
what the title of the book suggests, pen pic-

tures, character sketches. When a man is able 
to draw a living picture out of material gath- 
ered largely from the Rebellion records it is 
evidence of more than ordinary ability at por- 
traiture; and the knowledge that such was 
the source of much of Mr. Bradford's mate- 
rial should incline us the more readily to 
accept the portraits as genuine. Verisimili- 
tude is stamped upon every sketch, regardless 
of the copious citations of sources. They are 
all sympathetic, yet pitiless. 

In nearly all the men dealt with here the 
elements were mixed. Johnston was straight- 
forward, absolutely honest and upright, cour- 
ageous beyond question, yet simple and 
demonstrative, even to the point of kissing 
his male friends. He loved his men and was 
loved by them. His great failing was that 
while he could see all the mistakes of Davis, 
Lee, Jackson, and the rest, he could see none 
of his own. Stuart figures here as a man of 
laughter. Light-hearted and gay and rollick- 
ing, he was yet a very Puritan in morals, 
devoted to duty and capable in the perform- 
ance thereof. Withal he was, says Sedg- 
wick, -"the greatest cavalry officer ever foaled 
in America." 

Longstreet was no less able and brave than 
Johnston; but he was hard-headed, even 
stolid, seeking to impose his own personality 
upon everybody else. With supreme trust in 
himself, he trusted no one else. No more 
striking contrast is presented by Mr. Bradford 
than when he says that Longstreet was always 
able to give a good reason for not arriving in 
time, but Jackson, when at his best, arrived in 
time in spite of good reasons. Blamed by 
many for the failure at Gettysburg, Long- 
street was determined not to bear the blame 
himself. Perhaps the cleverest bit of shifting 
in this matter Mr. Bradford has failed to men- 
tion. Years afterwards, when Lee was dead, 
Longstreet said that Lee was to blame, that 
Lee himself had said so and that Lee was too 
honorable a man to tell an untruth. After 
the war Longstreet became a Republican, 
that is, to the Southerner, a scalawag. For 
this the South never quite forgave him; but 
he never wavered, and always manifested 
charity for those who had none for him. 

Beauregard 's name betrays the Gallic blood. 
His head fairly boiled with ideas, some of 
them really good. Had they been followed, 
the Confederacy would have won, so thought 
Beauregard. Unfortunately this idea became 
an obsession with him; it was a malady that 
attacked some others also. But the man had 
fine traits; no one who had not could have so 
won and kept the devotion of his soldiers. 

Benjamin's patriotism has been a matter of 
dispute. If Mr. Bradford had contented him- 



self with saying that "it is utterly unjust to 
deny that his patriotism was genuine or that 
he gave his very best sincerely, ' ' the reviewer 
would be forced to take issue with him. But 
the author saves himself, at least in part, 
by qualifying clauses, "in his way," "as 
deeply as he could feel," etc. Danton, the 
Frenchman, when urged to flee for safety, re- 
plied that he did not carry his country on the 
soles of his feet. It seems that Benjamin did 
carry his country thus. Lee, Davis, Stephens, 
and thousands of others whose courage and 
devotion Benjamin spoke of with admiration 
might submit, but he would never be taken 
alive. They might remain to bind up the 
wounds of the broken-hearted and build again 
on the ruins of their country, but not so Ben- 
jamin, who fled to England and forgot all 
about the South. Had a man of foreign birth 
been the only one who thought more of him- 
self than of his country, the story would not 
be so bad. But Pryor, Wise, and others for- 
sook the country they had helped to plunge 
into woe and went to dwell in the North. 

Not so the gentle, large-hearted Stephens 
and the fiery Toombs, two men very unlike, 
yet both extremely devoted. Toombs did in- 
deed flee when everyone was seeking personal 
safety; but he never forgot his country, and 
he returned to do her good service. In both 
men we find a curious mixture of aristocracy 
and democracy. When the fight against the 
railroads and other powerful corporations had 
barely begun, Toombs was in the forefront of 
the fight and foresaw "starving millions of 
our posterity" robbed and given over to the 
keeping of these corporations. ' ' The right to 
control these railroads belongs to the State, to 
the people," said he, "and as long as I rep- 
resent the people, I will not relinquish it, so 
help me God." At the same time he favored 
giving over the people to the keeping of 
judges not subject to popular election or any 
sort of control. But the greatest contradic- 
tions are found in Stephens. Frail of body, 
practically all heart and intellect, he was 
easily touched by suffering and ever ready 
to relieve it, so much so as to win a slave's 
simple eulogy : ' ' He is kind to folks that 
nobody else will be kind to. Mars Alex is 
kinder to dogs than most folks is to folks." 
After this one is shocked to think that he 
would have made human slavery, wherein the 
many toil for the few, the cornerstone of the 
new government he was seeking to establish. 
He was a man of intellect, yet that intellect 
stopped just short of the profound. It is easy 
enough now for the mediocre mind, reading 
backward, to see that slavery was already 
doomed in 1860. Some mediocre minds saw 
it then. That a man of Stephens 's goodness 



1914

of heart and strength of intellect could not see 
it is one of the anomalies of the nineteenth 
century. 

If Mr. Bradford 's book should enjoy a wide 
reading in the South, it will serve a useful 
purpose there, as clothing with flesh and 
blood names which the mass of the people now 
know little about other than that they stand 
for half deified heroes whom it is more pious 
to worship than to suspect. The Northern 
man, also, may read of these Americans with 
profit. The last paragraph of the book is a 
bit of sermonizing well worth quoting : 

" Meade and Lee, Hancock and Longstreet, 
Reynolds and Pickett, even more, the common 
soldiers, North and South both, were all Ameri- 
cans, all ours, ours to praise, ours to be proud of, 
ours to learn from. The inheritance of their 
courage, their sacrifice, their loyalty to high ideals 
is one of which no country can ever hear too 
much. And if the tradition of these great souls 
brings with it glory, it brings duty with it also. 
We are not called upon to go out and fight in 
arms as they did, but tbere is plenty of fighting 
left. The danger to a republic from open war is 
great. The danger from self-indulgence, from 
pampered living, from the spirit of letting others 
do things, is even greater. I am ready to believe 
that at a sudden call to duty our automobiling, 
dancing, money-getting youth would respond as 
did those of '61, drop their play, and go out to 
defend a Cemetery Hill. But I wish we could 
make them remember that even in common, hum- 
drum, daily life every man has his Gettysburg 
sooner or later. Let him fight it and win it, so 
that his little republic for of sucb is made the 
great Republic shall be forever triumphant and 
free."

RECENT FICTION.* 



This is, I am told, the season of "hammock

For it is a curious notion that the least inter-

compete with the temptation to lie in a ham- 
mock. And for that matter the temptation 
which summer offers nowadays among the

but its opposite. One is in danger of playing

than browned) by the sun, but one must be 
a very independent person indeed to be in 
danger of spending too much of one's time in 
a hammock. The custom of our society does 
not permit of it. Yet "hammock fiction" is 
not designed for independent, custom-smash- 
ing persons. No. Hammocks and fiction have 
no relation to each other. Either fiction is so 
interesting that one reads it anywhere and 
anyhow, even when people come to call, or 
it is too dull to keep one from going to sleep 
in a hammock. But this brings me back to 
the belief that "light" fiction is more in- 
teresting than "heavy" fiction, to the Tired 
Giant theory of the novel, of which Mr. 
Wells speaks, and its brother, the Tired 
Business Man theory of the stage, of which 
everybody speaks, or, until recently, did ever- 
lastingly speak. As if Mr. Martin Andersen 
Nexo's "Pelle the Conqueror," which is 
heavy fiction about a boy in Denmark, were 
less interesting than Mrs. Kate Douglas Wig- 
gins 's "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm," 
which is light fiction about a girl in America ! 
The division of fiction into light and heavy 
is utterly misleading. It would be much more 
to the point to divide it into sweet and salt. 
That is sweet which is capable of being ap- 
preciated by girls with their hair down their 
backs or the boys who count on being fresh- 
men next October; and, too often, by their 
fathers and mothers. Since a tooth for sweets 
is hardly more a trait of adolescence than of 
maturity. That is salt which, while it often 
mightily offends those who like the sweet, 
is capable of interesting immensely those of 
a robust fibre. Art has something to do with 
it, of course; sometimes it plays hob with 
my so-simple classification, bringing the robust 
reader to the sweet kind of thing, and vice 
versa. But mostly art is on the side of the 
salt just as readers are mostly born to read 
either the sweet or the salt; and no power of 
example and no amount of training can change 
them. All hammock fiction is sweet: the 
problems of conduct presented are never real ; 
the moral values are never sharply defined; 
and the ending is happy. But I would not 
say that all sweet fiction is intellectually dis- 
reputable. The six novels below are chiefly 
sweet, and yet, for one reason and another, 
they are to be considered. 

The Baroness von Hutten will be remem- 
bered as the writer whose "Pam" and "Pam 
Decides ' ' so excited the young person of eight 
or ten years ago. Pam was the sort of girl 
who, when a caller asked for Mrs. So-and-So, 
calmly replied: "I'm sure you mean my 
mother. She's Miss So-and-So," as, indeed, 
she was. The heroine of the present novel is 
not as wicked as Pam's mother. Maria fell

desperately in love with a person of high de- 
gree who was already married. There were 
extenuating circumstances. For one thing 
the man's wife did not love him; she had 
married him, as he had her, for reasons of 
state or politics or whatever the reasons are 
that control the matrimonial adventures of 
kings and queens. Maria was a singer, and 
alone in the world. Her only complaint of 
life was that her singing, though wonderful, 
lacked the specific and marvellous "some- 
thing" which singing ought to have. Any 
one who has read novels about women with 
the capacity to sing understands at once, 
which saves the Baroness von Hutten a deal 
of trouble. In the end, though only at the 
very end, Maria turns back from the railway 
train by which she has planned to join her 
lover. The sorrow of giving him up does the 
trick; henceforth her voice is divine. This 
is, perhaps, an unfair summary of a novel 
that is undeniably amusing. But is it not 
sweet ? 

Miss Phyllis Bottome (if it is Miss) starts 
off almost in the salty vein. The cure, being 
at the house of a Miss Prenderghast, thought 
to himself: "English ladies can have no 
temptations: That is why they are protes- 
tants." But this sort of thing proves to be 
only a pocket. Jean, the musician, is in love 
with Gabrielle and Margot is in love with 
Jean. The result is that Jean, discovering 
that Gabrielle is an adventuress with a past, 
is broken-hearted enough to produce music 
even if it is broken music and Margot sings 
her heart out to the delight of her compa- 
triots. There is ease here, and cleverness, but 
only in the use of a formula already well- 
worked. 

The hero of the Baron von Wolzogen's 
musical novel, "Florian Mayr," is a genuine 
artist and a favorite pupil of Liszt. It is 
said, by persons who ought to know (as well 
as by Mr. James Huneker), that the portrait 
of Liszt is the best one extant. But whether 
or not the drawing is accurate to the life, 
the figure is a striking one. It is astounding 
to find this German novelist working in so 
much feeling with so little sentimentalism ; 
so much respect for the artist with so keen 
a humor. Those writers who make a religion 
of baiting the bourgeoisie are usually unequal 
to the task of justifying the artist. But 
von Wolzogen is never shrill; he is sturdy; 
he is, in the slang of the day, "human." 

The hero of "The Trend" is hardly human. 
Mr. Arkwright confesses as much in a fore- 
word. He says of his characters: "I think 
that all of them will be fairly intelligible to 
a thoughtful reader except perhaps Wil- 
liam Soulsby, and him I do not myself pretend 



to understand. His sufferings like his devo- 
tion are of course patent . . . but, after all, 
was he one of us?" This trick for it is 
hardly less is not an engaging one. The 
reader will feel like assuring Mr. Arkwright 
that it is his business to understand his chief 
character and to make us understand. Other- 
wise, why write? But Mr. Arkwright 's novel 
holds up better than his William Soulsby. If 
we doubt the existence of a street waif with 
a voice like a horn from heaven, who creates 
the role in a new opera and dies as he sings 
the last note, we cannot doubt the Tasmanian 
wife of the rather pedantic old family friend 
from Australia. And Bob, who discovers 
William, is decidedly pleasant. There is 
almost as much salt as sugar here, but the 
writing is too formal for contemporary taste. 
Most readers will find it stilted and some will 
be utterly put out to find a lecture on style, 
several pages of it, toward the end. 

Mr. Eden Phillpotts's new novel is not of 
Dartmoor but of Devon, and not of the 
present but of a hundred years ago, when 
smuggling was almost as lively a trade as 
privateering. The girl whose name serves as 
a title, Faith Tresilion, is a fine, brave crea- 
ture who effects a desperate rescue in a small 
boat while under fire. She was not at all, 
as the sentimental innkeeper, Mr. Sidebottom, 
explains, "what one expects from an unmar- 
ried girl." Perhaps Faith owed a good deal 
to her mother, who was bedridden, but who 
said of herself: "owing to my character and 
the brains in my head and my great power of 
language I count for twice as much as a lot 
of other every-day females that have the use 
of their legs." Mr. Phillpotts is an honest 
craftsman, if not an inspired one, whose novels 
are neither salt nor sweet. 

Mr. Hugh Walpole has now for some time 
been groomed for a place alongside Mr. Wells, 
or at least Mr. Bennett. But "The Duchess 
of Wrexe" will hardly put him there, even 
if it has interested Mr. Henry James to write 
about it. Mr. Walpole 's skill, and his serious 
conception of his task, which are what rec- 
ommend him to Mr. James, are beyond ques- 
tion. But a novel which offers to study a 
society must stand rather firmly where con- 
duct is concerned and that whether it is as 
satirical as Herr Arthur Schnitzler or as pon- 
tifical as Mr. Winston Churchill. Mr. Wai- 
pole's duchess is too interesting a figure to 
omit; the powerful ones of the Victorian 
manner and tradition have still an interest 
for us even though we think we have ceased 
to respect them. But Mr. Walpole 's Rachel, 
who occupies as much of his interest as, and 
more of his space than, the duchess, needs 
more explaining than he has given her. It

is possible that a young woman of parts, 
having married a stupid man and fallen in 
love with a man whose dreams are as ( ' pagan ' ' 
as her own, would learn to love her husband. 
But it is difficult to understand why Mr. 
"Walpole regards the whole affair with so much 
complacency. He has not seen this thing 
sharply, either morally or psychologically. 
He has slurred its values. He has been sweet 
when he might have been salt.

lave of country. p j ay> < < The Mob ( Scribner ) , IS 

the world-old question, whose interest ever 
endures, What is a man who holds a faith 
with all his heart to do? The protagonist, 
Stephen More, Under Secretary of State and 
member of Parliament, is opposed to the war 
upon which his country is entering. Firm in 
his convictions that little nations have a right 
to live, that the annexation, which with vic- 
tory becomes inevitable, is depriving the 
enemy a wild, lawless race of a freedom 
that they cherish above all things, and that 
"as we are tender of our own land, so we 
should be of the lands of others," he raises 
his voice in the House, in the name of Justice 
and Civilization. With clear vision he places 
a message "from the great heart of man- 
kind" over and above the well-worn slogan, 
"my country, right or wrong." War has 
broken out even while he speaks, and every- 
where his lone opposition is declared as folly, 
a bit of "moon-summer madness." All rise 
against him : his father-in-law, who has done 
service in the War Department until his hairs 
are gray; his three brothers-in-law who are 
on the field ; his political associates who taunt 
him that little nations are his hobby and 
warn him that by his act he foregoes his 
chance to sit in the Cabinet; his friends who 
get entangled in their feelings and the con- 
ventions and yet, representing general senti- 
ment, obey the strongest common instinct in 
the world, love of country; his dark-eyed 
little Olive who begs her father to be on their 
side; Katherine, who deserts him because she 
feels too unheroic to remain his wife after she 
has implored him to come down to her level; 
and, finally, the hooting mob that hounds him 
to his death. Throughout it all he remained 
firm. Greater to him than the divine right of 
country was the divine right of mankind. 
With the consummate irony of which Mr. 
Galsworthy is a master comes the "after- 
math" at the very end: A statue is erected 



"To the Memory of Stephen More, 'Faithful 
to His Ideal.' ' Equally ironical is the sug- 
gestion which prevails in the whole play, that 
the mob-spirit dominates each individual, 
thinking separately, fully as much as it does 
the gay, unthinking revellers. It is a vivid 
presentation of what happens, and what has 
happened since history began, when men (like 
the element which gives the play its name) , as 
one of the characters says, "just feel some- 
thing big and religious, and go it blind." 



A history 
of Vassar. 



"Before Vassar Opened" 
(Houghton Mifflin) is an author- 
itative volume by Doctor James 
M. Taylor, who has only recently retired from 
the presidency of Vassar College, after a long 
term of service. This contribution to the his- 
tory of the higher education of women in 
America will appeal to all college women and, 
also, to that large circle of readers who are 
thoughtfully considering educational prob- 
lems. The opening chapters sketch very rap- 
idly the history of the higher institutions 
open to women in the South and in the North 
during the years before Vassar was founded. 
Without undue emphasis upon the hardships, 
Dr. Taylor pictures vividly enough the pov- 
erty in things material, and the wealth in 
aspiration and ideals characteristic of those 
early days when, as at Oberlin Collegiate 
Institute, "most of the ladies paid for their 
(weekly) board by their labor, 75 cents for 
vegetable diet only, 87% cents with animal 
food once a day. ' ' Stirring, indeed, are these 
records of the ways in which American women 
struggled for the privileges of a liberal edu- 
cation. The rest of the book is devoted to 
the history of Vassar. Matthew Vassar, En- 
glish by birth, was a brewer in Poughkeepsie 
who amassed a fortune of $800,000. Shrewd, 
practical, self-educated, deeply religious, he 
desired that his wealth should serve some 
high purpose, and through his niece, Lydia 
Booth, head of a seminary in Poughkeepsie, 
and through Doctor Milo P. Jewett, a man 
of education and of wide experience, who 
purchased Miss Booth's school, Matthew Vas- 
sar was led to found a college for women. 
There are many minor details given regard- 
ing the preliminary stages, and some very 
unimportant aspects of the many conferences 
are unnecessarily accentuated, but on the 
whole, the account of the foundation is ab- 
sorbing reading. Of keenest interest are the 
passages that set forth the policy and the 
academic ideals of Dr. Jewett, the first presi- 
dent, and of Dr. Raymond, his successor. The 
narrative pauses with the death of Matthew 
Vassar in 1868, when the college was well-

established and already recognized as a potent 
influence in the educational life of America. 
All those who know how high a standard of 
scholarship has been maintained by Vassar 
will welcome an introduction to the days when 
those standards were being discussed and 
defined. 

Four years of With a burning desire to see the 
adventure in world, and also with plenty of 
British pluck and tenacity, Mr. 
A. Loton Ridger, at the age of twenty-one, 
took passage on a tramp steamer for San 
Francisco by way of the Straits of Magellan 
(not "round the Horn," as he at first says), 
and for the next six years, with little inter- 
ruption, he was extending his knowledge of 
geography in both hemispheres, until at last 
he became well qualified for membership in 
the Royal Geographical Society and now ap- 
pends the initials, F. R. G. S., to his name on 
the title-page of his book, "A Wanderer's 
Trail" (Holt). Both Americas, from Alaska 
to Patagonia, eastern and southern Asia, and 
various parts of Africa were visited by him; 
and his study of native manners and customs 
was the more thorough from the necessity he 
was under of working his way at every step. 
Playing a minor part in a Seattle theatre, 
working in a lumber camp and elsewhere in 
the great Northwest, teaching English in a 
Tokio school, mining in the Rand, engaging 
in journalism in China thus and in a hun- 
dred other ways he contrived to keep himself 
from destitution and to provide the where- 
withal for such travelling expenses as were 
not defrayed by working his way on ship- 
board in any subordinate position he could 
secure. Admirable are the adaptability and 
tact and resourcefulness displayed by this 
Englishman, who wisely determined at the 
outset not to wear the stamp of his nationality 
as the most obvious item of his outward 
appearance. He does not hesitate to ridicule 
and censure those ultra-British qualities that 
might, in another, have made shipwreck of 
such an undertaking as he had in hand; and 
in commenting on certain educational defects 
of the average Englishman's he goes so far as 
to say, "We egregious English know more 
about football than the intricacies of our 
language. ' ' 

An Italian Once more the American In- 

studentof stitute of Criminal Law and 

Criminology has made a wise 
selection of a classic book for its series of 
translations. "Criminology" (Little, Brown), 
which Mr. R. W. Millar has translated, is 
by Baron Raffaele Garofalo. This distin- 
guished jurist of Italy has long been an in- 



stigator of thought and his authority fortifies 
the most essential conclusions of American 
reformers. He dismisses the juristic tradition 
that punishment is a measured evil corre- 
sponding to the degree of guilt (which may 
be fixed in advance), and substitutes the defi- 
nition that it ought to be a means calculated 
to effect the cessation of the criminal's harm- 
fulness to society. The true notion of crime 
is not legal but sociological, and many offences 
are contraventions of useful rules of conduct 
without revealing a character dangerous to 
the common welfare. By real or "natural" 
crime the author means "those acts which no 
civilized society can refuse to recognize as 
criminal and repress by means of punish- 
ment." The persons who commit "natural" 
crimes are classified as murderers, violent 
criminals, criminals deficient in probity, and 
lascivious criminals; and for each group the 
author proposes a suitable method of elimina- 
tion or repression. Among the debatable pro- 
posals of the book are : capital punishment of 
all who are convicted of murder; deportation 
of certain offenders; and the abolition of the 
jury system and of all pardons and amnesties. 
The author has more faith in the prognosis 
of criminal psychology and less faith in re- 
formatory education than we have in Amer- 
ica, and he has no confidence whatever in 
juries representing the people. On this point 
he seems to think of justice as a royal gift. 
"That a people is not capable of administer- 
ing justice is no reason for depriving it of 
justice. Whether deserving it or not, it should 
have justice imposed upon it ... What is 
needed to overcome its barbarous customs is 
not a jury, but judges who do not represent 
this people. ' ' This language would make most 
Americans cling more strongly to the institu- 
tion of the jury, with all its glaring faults. 
On the whole the work here noticed is one of 
the most instructive and stimulating contribu- 
tions to the study of crime and punishment, 
quite indispensable to the student of the 
subject. 






The "Fifty-eight Paintings by 
artin. Homer Martin" described by 

Dana H. Carroll (F. F. Sher- 
man) is a necessary complement to Mr. 
Mather's recent monograph on the painter. 
Like the books on Inness published in the same 
form and by the same publisher, these two 
books differ in plan and scope. Mr. Mather 
gives a study of the painter's life and art, 
illustrated by a few of his most characteristic 
pictures. Mr. Carroll on the other hand gives 
us independent descriptions of a great num- 
ber of the artist's paintings, not including 
those in the other volume. He offers, there- 



1914] 



THE DIAL 



57 



fore, a great opportunity to the student, for 
only a few of Homer Martin's pictures are 
to be seen in the great galleries, a few are 
accessible in clubs, while by far the greater 
number are in private collections. So the 
volume gives something which cannot other- 
wise be attained without great difficulty if 
at all. . Where a book offers so much of value 
it is not ungracious to find minor fault. We 
do not gain from the editor any comprehensive 
idea of the paintings of which he writes. He 
has chosen to present them in an order of 
which we do not grasp the significance, neither 
chronological so as to give an idea of the 
artist's development, nor according to sub- 
ject. Of course in such a collection the pic- 
tures themselves offer us much, however 
ordered and arranged. The lover of painting 
will want to appreciate the work of the 
painter for himself, and doubtless many will 
be helped by Mr. Carroll's descriptions. 
Homer Martin was so distinguished an artist 
and so little really known save to a few that 
we rejoice at this opportunity to know him 
better. No one else has felt the romance of 
.American landscape just as he did. He was 
not less impressed by its grandeur than was 
Cole and he rendered it not less truly than 
Durand. But the grandeur that he saw was 
truer than that of Cole, and his truth was on 
a larger scale than the fidelity of Durand. 
Others had much the same gifts, or greater 
than those early masters, Church for instance 
or Bierstadt. But no other painter has seen 
nature as did Homer Martin, or if he did, he 
did not so render her. 



The coir and The African impressions of a 
atmosphere of poet and dreamer and seer of 
North Africa. vj s i ons QJ.Q recorded with wealth 
of imagery and graces of rhetoric in Profes- 
sor George E. Woodberry's" North Africa and 
the Desert" (Scribner). Its sub-title, " Scenes 
and Moods," well indicates the book's char- 
acter, which is not unlike that of Mr. Robert 
Hichens's word-paintings of Mediterranean 
lands, a kind of artistry that, of course, owes 
far more of its charm and magic to the par- 
ticular way in which things are seen than to 
the things themselves if indeed there be 
any such entity as "things in themselves." 
The successive chapters treat of experiences 
and observations and reflections in Tunis, 
Tlemcen, Figuig, Tougourt, Djerba, and 
Tripoli; of "scenes and visions" in the Sa- 
hara Desert; and of meditations indulged in, 
over pipe and coffee, ' ' on the mat, " in a small 
oasis village of the Zibans. In his opening 
pages the author thus takes the reader into 
his confidence: "Tunis is the gateway by 



which I entered this world the new world 
of France, the old world of the desert. It 
was almost an accident of travel that I had 
come here, refuging myself from the life I 
had known, and seeking a place to forget and 
to repose, away from men. I had no thought 
of even temporary residence or exploration; 
but each day my interest deepened, my curi- 
osity was enlivened, my sympathies warmed, 
and slowly I was aware that the land held 
me in its spell a land of fantastic scenery, 
of a mysterious people, of a barbaric history 
and mise en scene, a land of the primitive. 
I coursed it from end to end." Toward the 
close of the volume the spirit of the African 
desert is thus presented: "In that nomad 
world, where everything is passing away, 
there is nothing fixed but the will of Allah. 
It is not strange to find fatality the last word 
of Islam. In the desert world the will of 
nature appears with extreme nakedness; the 
fortune of man is brief, scant, and unstable; 
the struggle is against infinite odds, a meagre 
subsistence is gained, if at all; and the blow 
of adversity is sudden and decisive. Patience 
everywhere is the virtue of the poor, resigna- 
tion the best philosophy of the unfortunate, 
and defeat, as well as victory, and perhaps 
more often, brings peace. These are great 
words of Islam, and nowhere have they sunk 
deeper into life than in the desert-soul. ' ' The 
book is, obviously, one to ponder rather than 
to gallop through, to read in certain moods, 
to drop, and to begin again, as impulse 
prompts ; and its wisdom of the Orient offers 
an excellent corrective to the harsh practical- 
ity of our restless Occidentalism. 



Comment and With his WOnted i 

Query on the sure grasp on many or the vital 

function of fear. ^^ of ^ pleaging anx i ous 

being of ours, Mr. Arthur Christopher Benson 
gives us a score of helpful and suggestive and 
eminently readable chapters on the nature 
and uses of fear. "Where No Fear Was" 
(Putnam) does not, as its title might lead 
one to infer, picture a state of existence de- 
void of terrors of countless kinds, but soberly 
faces the actuality of things and seeks to 
derive as much help and useful teaching as 
are to be had from the multiform manifesta- 
tions of this omnipresent though often merci- 
fully latent emotion of our common human 
nature. As is his excellent custom, the writer 
draws largely on his own experience for the 
illustration and elaboration of his theme. The 
now happily obsolescent but not yet obsolete 
fear of eternal punishment he takes early 
opportunity to dismiss as "simply inconsis- 
tent with any belief in the goodness of God. ' : 
Cheerful but not blindly optimistic is the 



58 



THE DIAL 



[July 16 



chapter on the uses of fear. "Fear is the 
shadow of the imaginative, the resourceful, 
the inventive temperament, but it multiplies 
resource and invention a hundredfold." Dis- 
coursing on that form of anxiety which comes 
from taking oneself too seriously, Mr. Ben- 
son interweaves one of those anecdotes from 
real life that help to give meaning and 
warmth and vitality to his pages. "I was 
sitting the other day, ' ' he tells us, " at a func- 
tion next a man of some eminence, and I was 
really amazed at the way in which he dis- 
coursed of himself and his habits, his diet, 
his hours of work, and the blank indifference 
with which he received similar confidences. 
He merely waited till the speaker had fin- 
ished, and then resumed his own story." No 
small part of the value and charm of the book 
lies in the writer's full and frank revealment 
of himself. It is the atmosphere of real life 
and not the musty air of the study that per- 
vades the volume. But this is no new feature 
of Mr. Benson's writing, nor can any new 
word of commendation be easily found with 
which to call attention to his book. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Scattered articles from the pen of the late 
William Garrott Brown have been gathered into 
a volume entitled " The New Politics and Other 
Papers" (Houghton). All of the articles had 
appeared in periodicals during the past eight or 
ten years, and dealt with political and economic 
questions that were then before the public. It 
must not be supposed, however, that the pub- 
lishers have erred in seeking to give them perma- 
nance. Though occasioned by immediate situations, 
they are of more than transient interest. The 
subjects treated are : " The New Politics," " Pro- 
phetic Voices about America," " The White Peril : 
The Immediate Danger of the Negro," " The South 
and the Saloon," " President Taft's Opportunity," 
and " Greetings to the Presidents " (Presidents 
Koosevelt, Taft, and Wilson). 

The reader is led to wonder, as he turns the 
pages of " The Conquest of the Tropics," whether 
Mr. Frederick TJpham Adams was moved to write 
the book as an advertisement for the stock of the 
United Fruit Company or to induce tourists to 
try the steamers of its " Great White Fleet," or 
as a defence of the company against the charge 
that it is a trust. The publishers (Doubleday) 
frankly state that this is the first of a series to 
be published concerning " big business " enter- 
prises in this country. They have done their part 
excellently. The product is finely printed, illus- 
trated, and bound, making an attractive volume. 
Unfortunately the title is misleading. Aside from 
one chapter devoted to sanitation there is relatively 
little concerning the real conquest of the tropics, 
but a great deal about the origin and methods of 
the fruit company.

" His Official Fiancee " is the title of a new 
novel by Bertha Ruch, in private life Mrs. Oliver 
Onions, which will be published shortly. Mrs

serials. She has gradually begun to do more seri- 
ous work. 

Former associates of Harry Peyton Steger, who 
died a year and a half ago, are collecting his letters 
for publication. Many of these letters are said to 
exhibit the qualities which made him so much liked 
among authors and publishers. Persons having 
letters from Steger are requested to send copies of 
them to Mr. John A. Lomax, Secretary of the 
University, Austin, Texas. 

Sir George 0. Trevelyan's " George the Third 
and Charles Fox," the second and final volume of 
which will be published in the autumn by Messrs. 
Longmans, brings to a close the series of six 
volumes of which the first four are entitled " The 
History of the American Revolution." Sir George 
has been engaged on the work since he left the 
House of Commons seventeen years ago. 

Miss Selma Lagerlof, who won the Nobel prize 
for literature in 1909, is the first woman to be 
elected to the Swedish Academy. Miss Lagerlof, 
who was the daughter of an army officer, was a

book for children, " The Wonderful Adventures of 
Nils." A novel, "Jerusalem," is now being trans- 
lated into English for publication by Messrs. 
Doubleday Page. 

An annual magazine edited by Mr. E. V. Lucas 
is announced in London by Messrs. Methuen. 
Among the contributors will be Austin Dobson,

cured for the first issue includes a letter from 
John Ruskin discussing the poetic achievement of 
" Men and Women " and a number of letters from 
Robert Louis Stevenson. 

Five new volumes will appear immediately in

" Chaucer and His Times," by Miss Grace E.

Professor Henry J. Cox and Mr. John A. Arming- 
ton, will be published this week by the University

versity of Chicago Science Series are announced 
for autumn publication. These are " The Origin 
of the Earth," by Professor Thomas C. Chamber- 
lin, and " Isolation and Measurement of the Elec- 
tron," by Professor Robert A. Millikan. This 
series proposes to make it possible for eminent sci- 
entific investigators to explain their researches not 



only to a wider public, but also to their scientific 
colleagues, in a form more attractive and accessible 
than is possible through articles in the scientific 
journals, which are often scattered. The size of 
the books will be 100 to 150 pages, duodecimo. 

It is announced that the "Century Magazine" will 
hereafter be published by the Century Magazine

been for the last year the editor of the " Century 
Magazine," will continue in that place and will be 
secretary of the new company. Mr. Carl T. 
Keller of Boston, an officer of the New England 
Telephone and Telegraph Company, is vice-presi- 
dent, and Mr. Robert H. Montgomery of New 
York City is treasurer. The " Century Magazine " 
will continue to be edited from its present offices 
and there will be, as in the past, close cooperation 
with the publishing business conducted by the 
Century Co. The new company is, however, dis- 
tinct from the Century Co. and McBride, Nast 
& Co. 

"Art and Archaeology " is the title of a new non- 
technical illustrated magazine published by the 
Archa3ological Institute of America, the first num- 
ber of which bears the date of July, 1914. During 
the present year four numbers will be issued, but 
commencing with 1915 the magazine will appear 
monthly. Its fifty pages are devoted to articles 
covering a considerable range, and to notes and 
brief book reviews. The articles include " Mas- 
terpieces of Aboriginal American Art L, Stucco 
Work," in which Mr. W. H. Holmes, of the 
United States National Museum, describes one of 
the decorative features of some of the great pre- 
historic structures of Yucatan and other parts of 
Mexico ; " The Visitation at Pistoia by Luca della 
Robbia," by Professor Allan Marquand, of Prince- 
ton; "Ancient Babylonian Antiquaries," by Pro- 
fessor Albert T. Clay, of Yale ; " Excavations at 
Vrokastro, Crete, in 1912," by Miss Edith H. Hall,

rial now being erected at Washington forms the 
first of a proposed series on " Modern Master- 
pieces of Classical Architecture." The general 
editor is Professor David Moore Robinson, of the 
Johns Hopkins University.

BOOK PRODUCTION 
FOR AUTHORS 

HPHE HENRY O. SHEPARD COM- 

PANY begs to direct attention to 
its very unusual facilities for the pro- 
duction of authors' books, whether in 
special or trade editions. 
A S publishers of THE DIAL and 
*r THE INLAND PRINTER, two 
periodicals whose typographical excel- 
lence is recognized throughout the 
country, this establishment is in posi- 
tion to guarantee the superior quality 
of its output. 

HE same minute care and atten- 
tion that go to the production of 
these two periodicals is at the service 
of authors desirous of having their 
books produced in correct and attrac- 
tive form. 

"C*VERY detail pertaining to the 
*""* production of a book will be un- 
dertaken, revision of the manuscript, 
type composition either by machine or 
by hand, proofreading, selection of 
the paper, presswork, preparation of 
design for and execution of the bind- 
ing. In addition, if desired, the ordi- 
nary publishing details will be attended 
to, such as sending editorial copies to the 
press, filling orders from the trade, etc. 

13 Y taking advantage of this service, 
authors may rest assured of having 
their books produced in more correct 
and attractive form, at considerably 
less expense, than if the work were 
entrusted to the ordinary publisher 
making a specialty of authors' editions. 

1P\EFINITE estimates and any fur- 
ther information that may be de- 
sired will be gladly supplied upon request.

A NARRATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE BIOGRAPHY, WITH PEN-PICTURES 
AND PERSONAL RECOLLECTIONS BY THOSE WHO KNEW HIM 

BY 
FRANCIS FISHER BROWNE 

Compiler of" Golden Poems," "Bugle Echoes: Poems of the Civil War," 
Laurel-Crowned Verse," etc. 

THIS biography of Lincoln brings the man, not the tradition, 
very near to us. It is Lincoln as his friends and daily associates 
knew him what he said to them, how he looked and acted while 
saying it anecdotes and stories by the hundred, all woven into a 
continuous narrative which holds the reader like a book of fiction. 

" There need be no hesitation in pronouncing this one of the 
best biographies in existence." The Review of Reviews. 

" It would be hard to name anything in Lincoln literature giving 
in popular form so sound and personal a picture of Lincoln the 
man." The Outlook. 

" No other book brings the reader so close to the actual Lincoln 
as this." The Churchman. 

"This book will become and long remain the standard 'Life' of 
the great 'Emancipator.'" Zion Herald.

Kit Carson Days 



By EDWIN L. SABIN. Kit Carson, the famous scout, 
guide, Indian fighter, and Indian pacificator, played 
a much more important part in the transformation of 
the West than is generally recognized. Mr. Sabin has 
written the first biography of this extraordinary char- 
acter that is really authoritative : and he has made it 
not only a personal record of Carson's achievements, 
but a history of the opening of the West. 

The book is illustrated from old and rare sources, 
and represents years of research throughout the coun- 
try, including the personal Intel-viewing of many of 
the veteran actors in the great drama of American 
expansion. Illustrated. Crown 8vo. Net $3.00 



The Coming Hawaii 

By JOSEPH KING GOODRICH. The United States 
Territory of Hawaii, the Paradise of the Pacific, holds 
increasing interest in the mind and heart of the 
nation. 

Beginning with Captain Cook and even earlier navi- 
gators, the history of this fascinating land is briefly 
told. Descriptions of the character and life of the 
natives and newcomers follow, and full space is given 
to the attractions of the islands for tourists and set- 
tlers. The products, business, and possibilities receive 
abundant mention, and little worthy of interest is left 
untouched. 

The volume is a timely addition to the " The World 
Today Series." The statistics are up to date.

Earmarks of Literature 

By ARTHUR E. BOSTWICK, author of " The Different 
West." The things which make good books good are 
here made_ clear and interesting for popular reading by 
the librarian of the St. Louis Public Library, who has 
gathered and grouped together many things that are 
herein discussed in readable and compact form.

The Two Great Art Epochs 

By EMMA LOUISE PARRY. To make the masters and 
masterpieces of art as familiar as are those of music 
and literature, is the aim of this notable work. It is 
not a critical study, but presents the historical devel- 
opment of art, beginning with Egypt, through Greek 
sculpture, early Christian art, to the final height of 
Italian art, on to the beginning of the Eighteenth 
Century. 

It is especially valuable because of its more than two 
hundred choice reproductions of the finest photographs, 
which clearly and strikingly illustrate the text ; and 
because of the text itself, which, based on a series of 
popular lectures, is unusually interesting, never dull, 
and always informing.

The National Social Science Series 

Edited by FRANK L. McVEY, Ph.D., LL.D., President 
of the University of North Dakota. The purpose of 
this series is to furnish for busy men and women a 
brief but essentially sane and sound discussion of 
present-day questions. The authors have been chosen 
with care from men who are in first-hand contact with 
the materials, and who will bring to the reader the 
newest phases of the subjects. It is the plan of the pub- 
lishers and the editor to present first books on what 
might be termed the fundamental subjects, to be fol- 
lowed by the discussion of specific topics.

Cubists and Post-Impressionism 

By ARTHUR JEROME EDDY. This remarkable work, 
while broadly historical and descriptive of many men 
and schools, presents a plea for the public to react to 
new impressions, and a defence of freedom for the 
artist to express himself untrammeled by the past. 

The author disclaims any more interest in Cubism 
than in any other ism, but is concerned in being as 
open minded to new pictures as to new ideas. An en- 
thusiastic admirer of art, and a collector, his story of 
the changes of the years by which the maligned and 
rejected of one period become the esteemed and sought 
after of another, is epigrammatic in style and attrac- 
tive in matter. Personal acquaintance with painters 
and paintings and wide study give fluency and power 
to his pen. 

The book is illustrated by twenty-four color plates 
and over forty half-tones of the pictures under dis- 
cussion. 8vo. Boxed. Net $3.00 

Junipero Serra, His Life and His Work 

By A. H. FITCH. The greatest name in Calif ornian 
history during the early period of Spanish occupation 
is that of Junipero Serra, California's greatest pioneer, 
and the first civilizer of our Western Coast. 

Intellectually and spiritually he ranks with the 
world's noblest. A born leader of men, with wonderful 
executive ability, he preserved to Sjpain the Pacific 
Coast from San Diego to San Francisco, and but for 
him the history of that region might have been writ 
differently. 

" A welcome addition to American historical litera- 
ture and will make it possible for Americans readily to 
become acquainted with a historical figure which has 
never yet received due attention or appreciation from 
the general public." New York Tribune.

INCENSE AND ICONOCLASM. 



Should criticism burn tapers and swing 
censers before the masters of literature, or 
should it take an axe and smash these idols 
of the past? The modern spirit, the demo- 
cratic spirit, is impatient of superiorities. It 
is inconvenient for it to have to worship dead 
people when it wants to worship its living 
self. It would like to see an Act of Oblitera- 
tion passed so that everything which hap- 
pened before it came upon the scene should 
be cast away. It feels confidently able to 
produce out of its own resources all that any 
reasonable creature needs in the way of lit- 
erary or artistic work. In some of the South 
Sea Islands, when a man has reached a cer- 
tain age he is buried in the ground up to his 
neck and left to his own devices. A good 
many modern writers, artists, and musicians 
would like to apply this method to their 
predecessors. 

There is a certain hardship in each age's 
struggle to attain expression against the over- 
whelming mass of expression already in exis- 
tence. In no other field of human effort does 
the practitioner have to contend with ghosts. 
A living general does not have to array his 
battalions against Caesar or Hannibal or 
Napoleon. A living athlete does not go up 
against Herakles or Milo. But a book or pic- 
ture or musical composition has to fight not 
only against its natural rivals of the present, 
but against all that has been preserved from 
the past. 

But what is the past? A book that was 
published or a picture that was painted yes- 
terday, belongs just as much to the past as 
art works of a thousand years ago. The 
human spirit is as fluid as air, but it is 
just as permanent. An idyll of Theocritus, 
"Aueassin and Nicolette," a ballad of Tenny- 
son, what earthly difference is there be- 
tween these except a trifle more or less of art 
and perfection. We ought all to be idol wor- 
shippers, because we all want our own memo- 
ries preserved. The man who smashes an 
idol does so in the hope of having his own 
statue set up in its place. But what guaran- 
tees have we that if we cut off the heads of 
our present rulers, the next generation will 



68 



THE DIAL, 



[August 1 



not dig up our bones and cast them into the 
common pit? 

We believe grocers classify four grades of 
eggs eggs, fresh eggs, strictly fresh eggs, 
and new-laid eggs. There is ever more variety 
of critical intelligence and taste among human 
beings, ranging from the crude instincts of 
the natural man, through various grades of 
educated opinion, up to the inspired appre- 
ciator. But as everyone has the inalienable 
right to judge for himself, as he can say 
that he prefers Martin Tupper or Walt Whit- 
man to Shakespeare, or considers Jane Austen 
a greater novelist than Scott, there is bound 
to be an immense amount of idol-smashing 
going on all the time. The statues of the true 
inheritors of the purple line cannot be kept 
on their pedestals without a vast amount of 
critical effort. 

And revolutions we must have. Every age 
tries to set its stamp upon its artists. It is 
only on condition that they paint its portrait 
that it allows their images to be set up in the 
Hall of Fame. The portrait painters of a 
shallow, selfish, and material age will thus 
be sadly in the way when the inspired delin- 
eators of a spiritual and heroic age come 
along. And the reverse is true. Even the 
most magnificent outbursts of the art spirit 
tend in time to become tame and conventional, 
and a recurrence to a fresher, if shallower, 
style is necessary. 

But in the end the classics emerge. How, 
it is hard to say, for they usually have to 
contend with barbarian popularities, they are 
usually eclipsed in their time by quite sec- 
ondary figures. Shakespeare was eclipsed by 
Jonson, by Fletcher, by Daniel. Goethe was 
eclipsed by Klinger, by Kotzebue, by Schiller, 
by Jean Paul. But the best are finally trium- 
phant, and the others range themselves in 
order under them. Then we think iconoclasm 
is out of place. Criticism, yes ! To show how 
these aristocrats of the intellect and soul dif- 
fer from one another, to point out in what 
qualities they are supreme, to show how the 
secondary figures approach or draw away 
from them, all this is gratitude's propi- 
tiatory offering, it is incense of the most 
refined kind. But to attempt to deal out de- 
struction to them is like the E erases I 'in fame! 
of the French sans culottes. They, though 
rising in all the ages, have been tried by a 
common standard, and they are bound to 
keep their places. 



But what is this common standard? Well, 
there are hierarchies of art qualities and hier- 
archies of art forms. Taste runs in cycles: 
the same essential needs of human nature 
crop up at intervals and require to be ex- 
pressed. Each age gives its authors and 
artists a list of the things it wants done. What 
one age considers of prime importance may 
rank low in the opinion of the next: but 
taking the whole roll of time, it is not diffi- 
cult to see what are the prime and what are 
the secondary qualities of art. 

In literature it is first of all necessary that 
a writer should have something to say and 
that he should know how to say it. The two 
things usually go together. Though the great 
thinkers may be rare, and the great colorists 
in words almost to be counted on one's fin- 
gers, anyone who has an emotion or an idea 
can usually find language which will be at 
least adequate. Execution, however, counts 
for so much in literature that a writer of very 
inferior intellectual powers who has the in- 
stinct for the ordering of perfect words may 
outrank a greater man. 

Creativeness is the next requisite for a 
great literary artist. Do writers create ? We 
believe so: at least they produce something 
which did not exist in the world before. The 
photographic reproduction of reality is prac- 
tically impossible, for the dullest and prosiest 
writer who merely desires to report what he 
sees has to report it as he sees it, which is 
differently from anybody else, and quite other 
than the actual thing. On the other hand, a 
writer's attempt to juggle with his materials, 
to use nature and life as masks, to create by 
the way of allegory and symbolism, results 
in a secondary kind of art. When an artist 
has to stand before his picture with a wand 
and explain that his men and women are not 
men and women but embodiments of moral 
qualities, that his tree shadows are emblems 
of evil and his cloud lights symbols of good, 
such a work may be interesting and an excel- 
lent puzzle-exercise for the intellect, but it is 
certainly not as good art as a picture which 
is intelligible at the first glance. It is the 
same with books. When allegorical or sym- 
bolical literature succeeds it is because read- 
ers pay no attention to its recondite meanings, 
but take it as a straightforward narrative of 
events. 

Power and Beauty divide literature be- 
tween them. To say that the latter rules alone

THE DIAL

seems to us as monstrous as to say that there 
is only one sex in the world. The materials 
of terror, horror, the grotesque, the ugly, the 
ludicrous, out of which probably two-thirds 
of literature is built, have no glimpse of 
beauty in them; they have immense power, 
and they thrill our minds as much as beauty 
can, though in another way. We feel a shock 
as keenly as we do an attraction. 

To come back to the question of incense and 
iconoclasm, have not all these art qualities 
we have enumerated been exercised since the 
beginning of literature? Has anything new 
been added in modern or comparatively mod- 
ern times? It is doubtful. There is a cer- 
tain glamor of image and expression, which 
seems to belong to Northern races, which 
comes out in the Icelandic sagas, the Irish 
epics, the Welsh bards, and the Mabinogion, 
and whose fullest development is in Shake- 
speare, Coleridge, and Keats. But there is 
something so like it in Sappho and Catullus, 
Theocritus and Virgil, that it is hardly worth 
while to make the distinction. Probably no 
French or Italian critic would admit that 
there is a distinction. Literature has passed 
through all possible phases of thought and 
expression again and again. 

As with art qualities, so with art forms. 
They were fixed almost at the start. There 
were the epic, the drama, the lyric. There 
were the secondary forms, the idyll, the phil- 
osophic poem, the prose narrative, the dia- 
logue, the essay, the epistle. Have we really 
invented anything new? Shakespeare min- 
gled tragedy and comedy, but so did some 
of the ancients. Herakles in the "Alcestis" 
is a comic figure, and some of Aristophanes 's 
plays rise to the region of romance if not of 
tragedy. Job's comforters are decidedly 
comic, though perhaps unintentionally so. 
We have, we think, invented the novel. But 
there are Greek novels, and the telling of in- 
terminable stories probably began with the 
Gave man. Scheherazade dates a good way 
back. We hear a good deal now about vers 
librc. Well, the Greeks had their dithyrambic 
verse, which was free enough. In English we 
had Skelton's ragged rhyme, the so-called 
Pindaric odes, Milton's and Matthew Arnold's 
irregular blank verse, the long irregular lines 
of Blake's Prophetic Books, the rhythmical 
prose of Macpherson's Ossian. Much of this 
is good enough, but none of it is the best. 
A man may be a good actor although he limps 



and croaks; but it is hardly worth while to 
cultivate those disadvantages. The very idea 
of verse is measure and ordered repetition. 
If you want to dispense with these things, 
why not write prose ? 

A new writer has to-day what a new writer 
always had, nature and humanity for his 
materials, words and tones for his tools. And 
he has his individual way of looking at or 
using these things. He may be wise or not 
to disregard the models of the past; but he 
may be very sure that he will not give the 
world anything new, except the touch of his 
personality, or his special skill with language. 
Mr. Comyns Carr tells a delicious story in 
his recent book, which seems to bear on this 
matter. Lord Randolph Churchill meeting 
Henry Irving at dinner told him that he had 
been to see him act Hamlet, but that he had 
been called away before the conclusion of 
the play, and would Irving be good enough 
to tell him how it ended. The latter concealed 
his surprise and gave a sketch of the last 
acts. "Good," said Lord Randolph, "I will 
come and see the whole piece. ' ' A few nights 
later he met the actor again, and said that 
he had not only seen him but had bought the 
book and read "Hamlet" and several other 
plays by the same author. "And do you 
know," he said, "I found them extremely in- 
teresting. ' ' Lord Randolph was a strong per- 
sonality, but he did not come to much, and 
perhaps part of the secret of this was his 
disposition to trust to his own resources. Our 
new novelists, poets, artists, and musicians 
who want to see the dead past bury its dead 
are in a like case. They do not realize that a 
real work of art is about the most living thing 
in the world. CHARLES LEONARD MOORE. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



LEGEND MASQUERADING AS HISTORY is too 
familiar to excite surprise, and too tenacious 
of its hold on the credulity of the unscholarly 
to admit of much hope that it will ever be 
made to relax that hold. For instance, the 
popular conception of Juggernaut (corrup- 
tion of the Sanskrit Jagannatha, Lord of the 
World, the name under which Vishnu, the 
Preserver, is worshipped at Puri in Orissa) 
is so far from correct as to ascribe to that god 
the qualities of Siva, the Destroyer, rather 
than those properly belonging to him; and 
even a competent writer like John Forster 
could allow himself to say, in his life of

Dickens : ' ' Pool* Johnny .Tetterby staggering 
under his Moloch of an infant, the Juggernaut 
that crushed out all his enjoyments." Long 
ago Sir W. W. Hunter, in his "Gazetteer of 
India," made it plain that this Juggernaut 
legend has no historical basis, unless it be the 
fact that in any religious ceremony attended 
by dense throngs of people a life or two may 
be sacrificed in the press, or a fanatical devo- 
tee may even sacrifice his own life. Another 
legend that dies hard is that of the supposed 
witch-burning at Salem. The recent destruc- 
tive fire that wiped out so many ancient land- 
marks in the old Massachusetts town elicited 
from the Baltimore "Star" the following: 
"On mere suspicion of being witches women 
were burnt alive. We should not be sorry 
that the old landmarks are gone. ' ' The witch- 
craft delusion was bad enough, and Salem has 
reason to be ashamed of its participation in 
the excesses that attended that delusion; but 
all New England was swept by the incredible 
superstition, to which even the learned and 
pious Cotton Mather gave his adherence, and 
Salem was not singular in its punishment of 
suspected persons. Nineteen of these were 
hanged as witches on Gallows Hill, and one, 
Giles Cory, was pressed to death for refusing 
to plead; but no burning at the stake took 
place either at Salem or elsewhere in New 
England. Nevertheless popular tradition will 
always have it that witch-burning is what 
Salem is chiefly to be remembered for in 

history. 



AN AUTHOR PESTERED BY AUTOGRAPH-HUNT- 
ERS has the choice of various ways of more 
or less gracefully eluding their importunities. 
Few such importunates succeed in eliciting 
from their victims so rare an epistolary gem 
as that recently made public by Mr. Lloyd 
Osborne, who on July 27 placed on sale at 
Sotheby's a number of letters and manuscript 
fragments in the handwriting of his step- 
father. The choice bit here referred to is the 
first draft of a letter to a certain petitioner 
for Stevenson 's autograph who had committed 
the blunder of misspelling (substituting ph 
for v} the name of him whose kindness was 
being thus presumed upon. The reply, perhaps 
needlessly tart, but eminently characteristic, 
was in part as follows : ' ' The few lines with 
which you have found time to honor me con- 
tain certain indications of your character on 
which I take a pleasure in dwelling. They 
show you so illiterate that I cannot judge 
your admiration flattering; they show you 
so careless of giving trouble to me that I am 
myself careless how much offence I may con- 
vey to you; and they are so ill-penned that 
I am tempted to hope you will discover a 



difficulty in perusing my answer, and place it 
unread in your collection. . . . The next time 
it shall occur to you to trouble an author as 
you have troubled me, find out I do not say 
what he has written far less do I suggest 
that you should read it but find out how 
he is in the habit of spelling his unpretentious 
name and give him upon that point the flat- 
tery of imitation." One is naturally curious 
to know whether the letter was ever sent, or 
whether, like so many letters that calm second 
thought consigns to the waste-basket, its mere 
writing served the purpose of safety-valve 
and rendered its actual sending as unneces- 
sary as it would have been, on the whole, 
unwise. 



HAWTHORNE'S EXCLUSION FROM BOSTON'S 
HALL OF FAME, a palace of immortality that 
is to be the abode of one hundred celebrities 
selected by a competent committee of Bos- 
tonians, is Boston's loss, as all will agree, not 
Hawthorne's. The rule requiring that the 
selected famous one should have done his best 
work within the city limits, or, if not there, 
within five miles of Beacon Hill, may of course 
be made to exclude the author of " The Scar- 
let Letter, ' ' which was written in Salem. But 
there are not a few readers of Hawthorne who 
prefer "The Blithedale Romance" to any- 
thing else produced by its author; and this 
admirable work was conceived and written in 
the rough (in note-book jottings) at Brook 
Farm, now within the city 's bounds, although 
the finished novel took shape at West New- 
ton, where Hawthorne lived for several months 
in 1852. Why, let us ask, should so much 
stress be laid on the mere act of writing, when 
the conceiving and the mental elaboration 
of a literary masterpiece are the important 
things? And who knows how much of Haw- 
thorne's most fruitful imaginative activity 
may not have been in Boston, which was one 
of his many places of brief residence, at the 
time of his holding a position in the Boston 
customhouse, and about which he has written 
so much, in his "American Notebooks" and 
elsewhere? It surely should not require any 
dangerous strain on Boston's New England 
conscience to claim our first master of prose 
fiction as her own spiritual citizen, as he was 
once her bodily resident. 



SIMPLIFIED SPELLING'S LATEST RECRUITS, it 
appears from the "Bulletin," from which it 
is always a pleasure to quote, are the gay and 
giddy devotees of the turkey trot, the tango, 
the kitchen sink, and the other curious capers 
of that class. Just how it came about that

comfort to the spelling-reformers, is thus 
explained: "The keepers of restaurants and 
saloons hav introduced for the 'entertainment' 
of their 'patrons' the delites of song and 
dance, in order to stimulate orders for meat 
and drink. Some advertize 'the dansant,' 
Avhich is supposed to mean 'dancing tea,' 
whatever that may be. But the printers often 
print the frase 'the dansant,' and the easy 
'patrons' accordingly pronounce it, we sup- 
pose, 'the dan-sant' (daen-saBnt), as if paral- 
lel to 'the can-can' or 'the one-step.' This 
givs, of course, a clear notion of what a 'dan- 
sant' is. The occult 'dansant' has reacted 
upon the spelling of dance, which now reap- 
pears sometimes as 'danse' a good result 
from a queer source." Of course "danse," 
as well as ' ' daunse, " " daunce, ' ' and ' ' dance, ' ' 
has good authority in our early literature, as 
the writer of the foregoing points out; and 
the form thus inadvertently restored by the 
disciples of Terpsichore has, for the spelling- 
reformer, this advantage, that its past tense 
and past participle may be phonetically writ- 
ten "danst," and these new forms open 
the way for "pranse," "pranst," and so on. 
Worse things might happen than a general 
agreement upon one form for the variable and 
often interchangeable endings -nee, -nse; but 
to admit this is by no means to .take the 
"advanst" position of the Simplified Spelling 

Board. 



THE BIG BOOK FAIR AT LEIPZIG, or, in official 
language, the ' ' Internationale Ausstellung f iir 
Buchgewerbe und Graphik, ' ' has opened most 
auspiciously. In its first six weeks, and before 
the vacation season had well begun, the turn- 
stiles recorded the visits of more than a 
million interested sight-seers, who have had 
displayed before them all the marvellous proc- 
esses known to the arts of printing and illus- 
tration. Divided into eighty sections, the 
vast exhibition presents everything conceiva- 
ble in connection with the impressing of visible 
or (for the blind) tangible marks on plain 
surfaces, from the stamping of oilcloth to the 
printing and illustration of the edition de 
luxe and the manufacture of books in raised 
type. The busy book-producing Saxon city, 
noted for its annual book-market, is just the 
place for holding such an exposition as the 
present. Printing in the land of its birth 
(with apologies to China) is symbolized and 
glorified by the heroic statue of Gutenberg 
unveiled a few weeks ago in the centre of the 
splendid fair that may be said to owe its 
existence to the inventive genius of Mainz who, 
almost five centuries ago, began those opera- 
tions with movable wooden types that have 
led to such astonishing results. Not the least 



admirable and creditable part of this great 
exhibition is the American section, as many of 
our compatriots will discover for themselves 
before the season closes. 



THE WORLD'S GREATEST PUBLISHING HOUSE,. 
as the "Book Bulletin" of the Chicago Public 
Library informs its readers, is the govern- 
ment printing establishment at Washington f 
"the finest and best-equipped in the world r 
and no nation approaches this country in the 
effort to enlighten its people through the me- 
dium of printers' ink. Nearly six million 
dollars has been appropriated this year to 
maintain the government printing office. At 
enormous additional cost for expert service, 
the government secures the material for its 
publications on all sorts of subjects. Some 
of the publications are in the form of portly 
books, some are bulletins, some are circulars, 
and an important section comprises maps." 
And, furthermore, some of the publications 
are windy political harangues, printed in the 
'.'Congressional Record" as if actually deliv- 
ered before our national legislators (though 
never actually inflicted on any audience) , and 
sent out at public expense in thousands of 
copies, to remain unread by as many unap- 
preciative constituents of the senders. No 
private publishing house could endure for a 
week the enormous waste that gives so little 
concern to those who year after year pay for 
the maintenance of this biggest printing and 
publishing plant in the world. 



THE LATEST BACONIAN ABSURDITY takes the 
form of a bulky volume by a certain Mr. Har- 
man, an Englishman, who sets himself the 
stupendous task of proving that the Lord 
Chancellor wrote, in addition to his own and 
Shakespeare's works and sundry other books 
of his time, Spenser's "Faerie Queene" and 
"Shepherd's Calendar," Samuel Daniel's 
letter from Octavia to Mark Antony, and a 
number of other things that have hitherto 
escaped the Baconian drag-net and been 
allowed to mask themselves under spurious 
authorship. Mr. Harman's six hundred pages 
are little likely to become household words 
on this side of the Atlantic, or indeed on either 
side, and most readers of this brief notice will 
probably content themselves with such second- 
hand information about the book as is here 
offered. The title of the work is "Edmund 
Spenser and the Impersonations of Francis 
Bacon." Why would it not be shorter and 
simpler, instead of proving the Baconian 
authorship of so many Elizabethan books, one 
at a time, to establish the non-Baconian origin 
of such few as may fairly be allowed to other

A FORTHCOMING LITERARY "SENSATION" is 

foreshadowed by the London correspondent of 
the Boston "Transcript," who says he has 
received confidential information about an 
important book soon to be issued and to 
contain a most dramatic disclosure of the 
liveliest interest in political circles. "It is 
permissible to add," he continues, "that the 
book in question is a 'Life of Cardinal Man- 
ning,' and that it will contain correspondence 
between a retired parliamentary leader and 
an Irishman who was much in the public eye 
over twenty years ago. In this correspon- 
dence is one outstanding fact, and in that fact 
lies the 'sensation.' ' It is a cruel position to 
be in restrained by a sense of honor from 
revealing a choice secret that will very likely 
leak out before long through some less con- 
scientious channel. Would one, we wonder, 
be getting "warm" if one were to guess that 
the Irishman ' ' much in the public eye s over 
twenty years ago ' ' is Charles Stewart Parnell ?

MEXICO'S FIRST BOOK, which is believed to 
have been also America's first book, was 
printed on a primitive press sent over in 1535 
in the charge of Juan Pablos by Jules Crom- 
berger, who had opened a printing house in 
Seville and was led to hope that a similar 
establishment in the transatlantic Spanish pos- 
sessions would prove a profitable business ven- 
ture. Thus it came about that in the year 
1536 there appeared in Mexico City a Spanish 
book of a religious character, bearing the title 
(we give it in translation), "A Spiritual Lad- 
der for Reaching Heaven." Times have 
changed in Mexico since then ! 



COMMUNICATIONS. 

PROFESSOR BRANDES AND AMERICAN 
CULTURE. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
After a journey of three weeks, Professor 
Brandes is making known his impressions of 
America. They are crystallized in this bright 
jewel : " the country of the shaved barbarians." 

It is true that even after having been personally 
feasted out of reason, every superlative being 
called into action to reflect his greatness, Professor 
Brandes could not justly be expected to heap com- 
pliments upon the country he saw in brief, kaleido- 
scopic reflex. Nevertheless, " the land of the shaved 
barbarians " will impress many of us who are 
obliged to remain behind and to sustain the Ameri- 
can form of life, with the feeling that some 
apparently decent person spits in our face. 



Professor Brandes, writing in the " Politiken," 
finds that America possesses the material basis for 
highly developed mental culture, but no more. He 
compares contemporary America with Europe of 
the dark ages, and finds that they agree appre- 
ciably. The accumulation of vast personal wealth 
in great commercial centers, and the visible use of 
this wealth for the purpose of mental culture 
through great universities and museums, this is, 
as it was in early Europe, the beginning of a period 
of culture in America. Thereupon the genius ap- 
pears, organizing a cultural development, that 
human genius commonly called the great man, who 
needs and utilizes all the outward things, money, 
the university milieu, laboratories and institutional 
apparatus generally. 

In advancing this view Professor Brandes fulfils 
the prophecy of Disraeli, who warned us of the 
time when comfort should be mistaken for culture. 
It is a view common enough in Europe, but 
scarcely worthy of Professor Brandes. He might 
be expected to recollect Disraeli's warning well 
enough to rise above the common European cultural 
egotism, according to which you swim on the crest 
of a cultural wave if you insure for yourself a 
liberal income and the greatest possible amount of 
modern improvement in material comfort. In 
America this view of life generally is discredited. 
As for the universities, only a short time ago Presi- 
dent Jordan called attention to their danger of 
being over-equipped with material comforts. Pre- 
viously, amidst a modest equipment, the student 
and the investigator were obliged to devise their 
own minor apparatus; to struggle with difficulties 
and to overcome them; to work ahe#d without 
awaiting an endowment. Nowadays you press a 
button for this, issue an order for that, draw on 
this fund or obtain support from that; but all 
these outward facilities do not, in themselves, stim- 
ulate independent activity in research, and the 
material endowments do not result in a propor- 
tionate mental and scientific activity. 

Rags certainly are not, per se, a comfort, yet 
there is no causal relation between accumulated 
commercial wealth and human culture. Moreover, 
cultural development in the past almost invariably 
involved an explosion of some superstition touch- 
ing the importance of some material power. Real 
progress in human culture is not assisted by being 
an object of institutional protection : it acts inde- 
pendently until it has conquered. 

Professor Brandes is greatly mistaken in antici- 
pating for America any cultural progress save 
that which is based upon idea and will-power. 

Human culture, as a standard of measurement for 
social conditions ; human culture as a climax in the 
activity of numerous, mutually incongruous forces 
influencing national and individual life; human 
culture as the spontaneous utterance of genius in 
man : will these problems be solved in America ex- 
actly in the same way as in Europe? For the pres- 
ent, it seems that America excels in the estimation 
of those particular life activities whose improve- 
ment is judged socially advantageous. In America 
human culture means an improvement of the com- 
mon basis of life, and not a condition of egotistic 



1914]

comfort acquired by a few and humbly supported 
by the multitude. 

Professor Brandes might be expected to com- 
prehend this without calling into service more 
circumspection than was afforded by his bird's-eye 
view of this country. We are quite accustomed to 
criticism using " severo ac atroci stylo," but an 
epithet in the style of a sensational newspaper 
headline is hardly worthy of one who cannot have 
forgotten Holberg's epigram, ut studeam, studeo.

"ALL QUIET ALONG THE POTOMAC." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In THE DIAL of July 16 Mr. Hyder E. Rollins 
says that in W. C. Bryant's " Library of Poetry 
and Song" (1871), "All Quiet along the Potomac" 
is credited to Mrs. Ethel Beers. 

Referring to Mr. Bryant's volume, I find the poem 
credited there to Mrs. Howland, on page 381, under 
the title, "The Picket-Guard." In the index of 
authors the name of Mrs. Beers does not appear.

THE TRUTH ABOUT RECONSTRUCTION. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In the issue of THE DIAL for July 1 there ap- 
pears a letter on " The Character of the Mexican 
People " from Mr. E. L. C. Morse of Chicago. In 
the course of his remarks Mr. Morse, desiring to 
draw an analogy, goes somewhat out of his way 
to sneer at the American Negro. Two millions of 
the inhabitants of Mexico, he informs us, are white 
people, chiefly of Spanish origin. The remaining 
twelve millions are of mixed Indian ancestry: "A 
psychological anthropologist would probably call 
them morons physically adults, mentally chil- 
dren. In that respect they are much like our 
negroes before the war." Further on we read: 
" Many of our good people half a century ago 
assumed that the negro had high and lofty aspira- 
tions for constitutional government and political 
freedom." Then follows once more the charge of 
the Negro's incompetency as shown in the days of 
Reconstruction, with all the old story of graft, 
lack of political insight, etc., etc. 

Is it not about time that a stop should be put to 
these old slurs and slanders on the Negro ? Simple 
historical accuracy to-day demands that the facts 
of Reconstruction be studied without prejudice 
and with a reasonable amount of care. No situa- 
tion that has ever arisen in American history has 
received more gross exaggeration than the tale of 
the ex-slave's shortcomings when he was given a 
chance in the political life of the nation. Why? 
Because it is the popular thing to give the Negro 
a kick. As a matter of fact the Negro was for the 
most part simply the victim of the greed of men 
far more criminal and at the time more capable 
than himself. Major John R. Lynch has recently 
shown us in "The Facts of Reconstruction" (issued 
by the Neale Publishing Co., New York) that in 



Mississippi, where the Negroes reached the highest 
political power, they at no time had more than 
thirty-four out of the 140 members of the Legis- 
lature; but that they took part in those govern- 
ments which put the Southern states in harmony 
with the nation and that they helped to plan and 
organize the present Southern common school sys- 
tem. In view of such facts as these, current and 
popular exaggerations would at least seem to be 
in need of modification. B. G. BRAWLEY.

IMPRESSIONISTIC CRITICISM. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
I agree with your correspondent, Mrs. Laura 
Tobey, on the lack of value of " grocer-shop criti- 
cism." The trouble with such criticism is that it 
presupposes a standard of absolutes of literary 
weights and measures which does n't exist. Peo- 
ple have not yet succeeded in reducing life to any 
commensurate values of quarts or ounces, and it 
is futile to expect in the critic a higher sensibility 
of perception than in the creative artist who is 
in the first place molded by life before he attempts 
to turn life into a mold and that mold not neces- 
sarily standardized in relation to the perception of 
antecedent artists. Then, in spite of the agreed- 
upon grocer-weight standard of measure, there is 
always the liability of human fallibility in the 
grocer. . . . However noble in intention, there is no 
such thing as an honest grocer in literary criti- 
cism. That is to say, there is no such thing as an 
objective critic. 

The only honest course, therefore, for literary 
criticism is that of frank impressionism ad- 
mitting, as it does, the likelihood of human error 
in judging a work of human intelligence, and 
striving simply to record an honest impression, 
no more and no less. Speaking from experience, I 
can say that the work of impressionistic critics is 
the only sort of criticism from which I have gained 
any real sense of values in regard to a new book 
of fiction, or a new play, or a new poem. Even 
when I have temperamentally so consistently dis- 
agreed with a particular reviewer as to buy always 
the books he disparaged, and to shun, for the most 
part, those he recommended, I have yet admitted 
by this very process the worth of his impres- 
sionistic judgment. 

From the so-called grocer-shop criticism I have 
derived neither the profit of coincident conviction 
nor the pleasure of honest disagreement. This de- 
vitalized theory of criticism simply reduces itself 
to an algebraic formula in which the reader's 
interest and enjoyment represent zero. 

Is it not significant that grocer-shop criticism 
almost always parades under the mask of anonym- 
ity ? It is the uniform of the so-called " sound 
reviewer," whose personality is various and may 
be interchanged ad lib., without any noticeable 
change in the product. Indeed, the instrument is 
fitted, interchangeably, for any commodity on the 



market.

MR. SHAWS NEW PREFACE.* 



Bernard Shaw has done more than any of 
his contemporaries to reconcile us to the 
thorough-going moralistic attitude, and he 
has done so by insisting that the conquest of 
morality is at least as difficult and dangerous 
as the quest of the Holy Grail. Odd that we 
should need to be reminded of anything so 
obvious. Yet in spite of the martyrdom of 
saints and the torture of heretics, in spite of 
Luther and John Knox, we are given to think- 
ing of morality in terms of submission rather 
than in terms of revolt. Mr. Shaw will not 
hear of this morality, which he has identified 
for his own purposes with the current sub- 
urban morality. As a matter of fact, we may 
doubt whether its influence is really so per- 
vasive; it is pretty certain that it has never 
gripped the masculine half of the race, how- 
ever much it may have served to console his 
mate in less militant epochs than ours. But 
it has been preached persistently by myopic 
persons of the best intentions, who remained 
blissfully unaware that it is rarely applied in 
practice. 

Those who fancy a quiet life only follow a 
profound instinct when they discourage the 
rise of a new moralist. Traditional morality 
is a convenient substitute for earnest thought. 
Those who disturb it, make us uncomfortable, 
and we revenge ourselves by calling them im- 
moralists, as in the case of Ibsen, or irre- 
sponsible paradoxers, as in the case of Mr. 
Shaw. It is a convenient way of evading the 
issue. But Mr. Shaw was determined that 
the issue should not be evaded, and he would 
not be Mr. Shaw if he had not had his way. 
Neither would comfortable abstract discussion 
serve, the futility of such discussion being 
sufficiently proved by the experience of those 
clergymen who find that they can continue 
to draw their salaries only by avoiding the 
concrete. Mr. Shaw, with the instinct of the 
dramatist, wrapped the Seven Deadly Sins in 
the trappings of our industrial civilization, 
and left them to point the moral. 

But it will hardly do, either, to say that he 
left his puppets to point the moral : he did 
not; he pulled up the curtain on the show, 
which he had first taken the trouble to make 
as amusing as possible, and then stepped to 
the front of the stage and harangued the mob 
in a preface. Mr. Shaw has ingeniously de- 
fended what surely needs no defence his 
reliance on the preface. Doubtless he was sin-

FANNY'S FIRST PLAY. With a Treatise on Parents and Chil- 
dren. By Bernard Shaw. New York : Brentano's. 



cere enough in what he said ; only one doubts 
whether he said all that was in his mind. 
Ordinarily, the playwright leaves the writing 
of his preface to the professional critic. But 
Mr. Shaw had seen what the critics did to 
Ibsen; that their ineptitudes and pathetic 
trivialities made a deep impression on his 
mind, is sufficiently apparent from the ex- 
tended excerpts he has ironically handed on 
to posterity in "The Quintessence of Ibsen- 
ism." Could, then, a serious dramatist, bent 
on handling subjects of the utmost social sig- 
nificance, trust himself to be interpreted by a 
group of amiable aesthetes, whom he himself 
had described as faineants? Whether he ac- 
tually asked himself this question or not, it 
is certain that Mr. Shaw did not hesitate to 
assume the risk of explaining his own mes- 
sage, an exceedingly delicate and difficult 
task in which he has absolutely no equal. So 
true is this that it is nothing but a work of 
supererogation to attempt to interpret Mr. 
Shaw, even if the attempt is not simply an 
ineptitude and consequently an impertinence. 
Those of us who delight in Mr. Shaw as a 
man with an infinite capacity for life and 
civic responsibility, do not in the least regret 
his facility in self-explanation, though when 
we are a bit impatient we may allow ourselves 
the trite remark that his skill in the preface 
is a measure of his limitation as a dramatist. 
We simply seize a shabby old idea one of 
those aesthetic ideas about which Mr. Shaw 
has happily shown so little curiosity and 
say that no first-rate creative gift has ever 
been so immediately intelligible, either to 
itself or others. What of it? We may be 
sure that Mr. Shaw has so profound a distaste 
for vagueness that we may doubt whether the 
possession of genius like Shakespeare's could 
compensate him for the sense in himself of 
something he could not fully comprehend. 

And apropos of the prefaces, the impression 
somehow prevails that Mr. Shaw's ideas have 
the precision and inexorable unfolding of a 
proposition from Euclid. Mr. Arthur Symons 
speaks with a shudder of his remorseless logic 
and unanswerable common sense. But if we 
think of Mr. Shaw as a person puffed up 
with the logician's silly pride in his logic as 
a weapon sufficient for any occasion, is it not 
because we are so largely occupied with the 
fictitious Shaw of the reporters rather than 
with the genuine Shaw of the prefaces? It 
would be nearer the truth to insist that what 
he has sought to give us is less a programme 
than a point of view. No, although he 
possesses enough ideas to set a score of doc- 
trinaires up in business, he is not himself a 
doctrinaire. He is concerned with the spirit 
rather than with the letter. 



1914] 



THE DIAL. 



75 



No better instance, indeed, of the con- 
cealed but still discernible modesty with which 
Mr. Shaw offers to arrange our destiny could 
be cited than his latest volume of plays. If 
he were really the prideful logician we care- 
lessly assume him to be, he would not have 
written two of the plays in this volume 
"Misalliance" and "Fanny's First Play," 
the third being nothing but a Shakespearean 
jeu d' esprit. For he is here engaged in ex- 
ploring the problem of parents and children; 
and, although his moralist's hope of a better 
humanity rests squarely on the child, it would 
be idle to pretend that he has given us any- 
thing like a programme for improving the 
state of the child. He cannot tell us in detail 
what we ought to do, though he has no hesita- 
tion in telling us what we ought not to do 
his task there being reduced to a simple 
description of our actual practice. 

The two chief influences in the life of the 
child are, of course, the home and the school. 
In the well-known Shavian view, the middle- 
class home is no place for any social being; 
. it is exclusive and narrow; a place where 
people make affection an excuse for deplorable 
manners. It is bad for adults, impossible for 
children. A child has no political rights; it 
is a chattel, the exclusive possession of its 
parents, who may ruin it as effectually by too 
much petting as by too much beating. And 
the problem is further complicated by the fact 
that a child is a nuisance to a grown-up per- 
son. "What is more, the nuisance becomes 
more and more intolerable as the grown-up 
person becomes more cultivated, more sensi- 
tive, and more deeply engaged in the highest 
methods of adult work. The child at play is 
noisy and ought to be noisy: Sir Isaac New- 
ton at work is quiet and ought to be quiet. ' ' 

Moreover, real understanding cannot exist 
between an adult and a creature so essen- 
tially cruel and selfish as a child. It is idle 
to pretend that the family provides children 
with edifying adult society. Here, as in so 
many other respects, the home is nothing but 
a humbug. Mr. Shaw finds proof of this in 
the fact that parents who can afford to send 
their children to a board school will not have 
them at home. The parents, of course, will 
tell you that they have to educate their chil- 
dren ; but Mr. Shaw denies that the school 
exists to educate children; it exists to take 
them off their parents' hands. And what is 
this process of education like ? 

" With the world's bookshelves loaded with fas- 
cinating and inspired books, the very manna sent 
down from Heaven to feed your souls, you are 
forced to read a hideous imposture called a book, 
written by a man who cannot write : a book from 
which no human being can learn anything : a book 



which, though you may decipher it, you cannot in 
any fruitful sense read, though the enforced at- 
tempt will make you loathe the sight of a book all 
the rest of your life. With millions of acres of 
woods and valleys and hills and wind and air and 
birds and streams and fishes and all sorts of in- 
structive and healthy things easily accessible, or 
with streets and shop windows and crowds and 
vehicles and all sorts of city delights at the door, 
you are forced to sit, not in a room with some 
human grace and comfort of furniture and decora- 
tion, but in a stalled pound with a lot of other 
children, beaten if you talk, beaten if you move, 
beaten if you cannot prove by answering idiotic 
questions that even when you escaped from the 
pound and from the eye of your gaoler, you were 
still agonizing over his detestable sham books in- 
stead of daring to live." 

As a partial corrective of this black picture, 
one may say at once that Mr. Shaw frankly 
admits he was not beaten; but he assures 
us he was sent to a schoolmaster so excep- 
tionally indifferent that he was allowed to 
escape without learning anything. If neither 
the home nor the school will do for the child 
(which is, in the Shavian view, a fresh experi- 
ment of the Life Force trying to improve on 
its parents), what then? Here Mr. Shaw ex- 
plicitly confesses the inadequacy of logic : 

" I must not pretend, then, that I have a system 
ready to replace all the other systems. Obstruct- 
ing the way of the proper organization of child- 
hood, as of everything else, lies our ridiculous 
misdistribution of the national income, with its 
accompanying class distinctions and imposition of 
snobbery on children as a necessary part of their 
social training. The result of our economic folly 
is that we are a nation of undesirable acquaintances ; 
and the first object of all our institutions for chil- 
dren is segregation." 

We ask for a solution of this most perplex- 
ing of problems the problem of the child - 
and Mr. Shaw murmurs vaguely about a world 
made more habitable for children by Social- 
ism. But he does not pretend, you see, that 
he has a programme. What he wishes is to 
emphasize the spirit in which he thinks we 
should go to work. Take the case of political 
rights. Not the most astute of statesmen, ac- 
tuated by the most humane motives, could 
remove that disability of the child. As long 
as there are parents, children will be largely 
at their mercy. But this does not prevent us 
from hoping that we may in time improve the 
condition of the child by improving the in- 
telligence of the parents. And what Mr. Shaw 
would have parents see, is that their posses- 
sion of the child does not involve the right 
to do with it as they see fit, to coerce it into 
satisfying their own ideas as to a career or a 
religion, and to playing generally the part of 
providence as if they were omniscient beings. 
And as to the school, the same principle ap-

plies. It may be necessary to teach some

not necessary to impress that fact upon the

CHAUCER AND THE ROMAN DE L.A BOSK.* 



Few books in the whole realm of extant lit- 
erature have exerted a more profound and 
widespread influence upon literary men and 
their work than did the Roman de la Rose in 
the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries in 
Europe. It belongs now to a dead past, a 
past of obsolete or obsolescent ideas and 
ideals, and few there are to do it reverence. 
All readers of Chaucer, however, will remem- 
ber that in his youth he translated a part of 
this immense and popular poem, while even 
the casual student must have noticed how in 
his later work he adapted its technique and 
humanized (that is, humorized) its philoso- 
phy. Chaucer's debt to the two authors of 
the Roman, the gentle Guillaume de Lorris 
and the cynical Jean de Meung, has been 
the subject of a deal of scholarly research 
with the usual polar results, one school mak- 
ing Chaucer a servile imitator and the other 
erecting him into complete independence. 

The most recent contribution to the sub- 
ject, "Chaucer and the Roman de la Rose" 
by Dean Spruill Fansler, has no extreme 
thesis to maintain, and so in all probability 
wins closer to the truth* but it pays the pen- 
alty of too much qualification. It has no out- 
and-outness. Much of the time the author 
appears to be differing just a little from 
some other investigator who has stated con- 
clusions in the same field. Still the book is 
worth while in that Mr. Fansler has followed 
a different and more significant method in 
his study; he has classified Chaucer's bor- 
rowings "according to the nature of the pas- 
sages taken over." By this method he has 
arrived at some trustworthy conclusions on 
the interesting question : which of the authors 
of the Roman influenced Chaucer more ? 

Briefly this is the answer: Chaucer went 
to de Lorris for lessons in technique, especially 
in description, but was never a mere imi- 
tator. He went to Jean de Meung for a 
rhyming dictionary, for bibliography, and for 
encyclopaedic knowledge on various subjects; 
but he never accepted any wholesale carton 
of Jean's opinion: where they show marked

similarity, they are both children of their 
age. In the author's anxiety to free Chaucer 
of all stigma of unrighteous imitation, he 
sometimes falls into tame personal expres- 
sions of faith, such as this: ". . . it is im- 
possible to think of Chaucer writing the 
Parlement, Hous of Fame, and Prologue to 
the Legend in serious rivalry of foreign 
models. I feel convinced that in these poems 
he had a deeper, subtler purpose, even though 
at present I cannot say just what it was." 
A very doubtful critical dictum is cited from 
Professor Kittredge: "The cynicism of the 
Merchant's Tale is ... in no sense expres- 
sive of Chaucer's own sentiments, or even of 
Chaucer's momentary mood. The cynicism 
is the Merchant's. It is no more Chaucer's 
than lago's cynicism about love is Shake- 
speare's." The comparison with Shakespeare 
here is rather unfortunate since Mr. Frank 
Harris has recently made out a very strong 
presumption of that very thing in Shake- 
speare. A man of genius has more than one 
facet, and poets especially never feel the 
necessity of being consistent. The parts are 
never greater than the whole; and we may 
be sure that if a poet ever invented a plausi- 
ble devil, he had a plausible devil in him the 
day he made the invention. 

The tables of parallel lines and passages 
appended are invaluable to the student; and 
the book is really a masterly thesis if not an 
epochal contribution to Chaucereana.

THE PRESIDENT OF FRANCE ON FRENCH 
GOVERNMENT.* 



A few years ago M. Raymond Poincare 
wrote for a publication circulating princi- 
pally among young people in France a series 
of simple articles descriptive of the origins 
and workings of the French governmental 
system, national and local. At the time nei- 
ther he nor any other person could have fore- 
seen that in 1913 he would be elected to the 
presidency of his country and that earlier 
writings of a supposedly ephemeral character 
would suddenly be vested with a nation-wide, 
and even a world-wide, interest. These things, 
however, have come to pass, and one of the 
first consequences has been the publication of 
the series of government articles in book 
form, and in English dress, under the invit- 
ing title, "How France is Governed." 

M. Poincare is fortunate in the fact that 
the writings thus brought under unexpected 
scrutiny are of such quality that they might

well stand entirely upon their own merit. To 
a high order of legal scholarship the author 
adds a rare fund of information acquired 
through twenty-five years of experience as a 
legislator and six years as a minister of state, 
and he is a master of that lightness and sure- 
ness of touch which is the glory of French 
writing upon political, as upon other, sub- 
jects. Simplicity and directness of statement 
will render the book attractive to persons who 
are but beginning the study of government; 
yet the subject matter is sufficiently weighty 
and authoritative to give the work a value for 
the most erudite expert in the field. 

M. Poincare introduces his subject in a nat- 
ural and agreeable manner by devoting his 
earlier chapters to the history and organiza- 
tion of the commune and the department. 
He then turns to the national government and 
in a general chapter sketches the growth of 
the French monarchy to the eighteenth cen- 
tury, the changes wrought by the Revolution, 
and the fundamental aspects of the state as 
organized to-day. Another chapter outlines 
the development of the concept of national 
sovereignty from the time when Gaul was a 
Roman province to the establishment of the 
Third Republic and of its representative sys- 
tem based upon manhood suffrage. Although 
it is not so stated, one may surmise that the 
indifference of voters which is exhibited so 
frequently at parliamentary elections in 
France is responsible for the forcefulness with 
which the author seeks to inculcate the idea 
that under the present democracy abstention 
from voting is "both a piece of foolishness 
and a civic desertion." The exclusion of 
women, he asserts, is justified "only by con- 
siderations of opportunism or by the resis- 
tance of custom." 

The bulk of the volume consists of chapters 
dealing successively with the constitution, the 
presidency, the ministry, the legislative cham- 
bers, justice, public education, the budget 
and taxation, and military service. Material 
which might easily be presented in a fashion 
remarkable chiefly for dryness is put before 
the reader concretely and attractively, and 
not without occasional flashes of pertinent 
humor. It was doubtless only after reflection 
that M. Poincare left out of the plan of the 
book a treatment of the rise, organization, and 
workings of political parties. The omission, 
however, must be adjudged a serious one. No 
description of the structure of the govern- 
mental system can convey a satisfactory idea 
of how France, or any other country, is 
governed unless it is supplemented with a 
characterization of the organizations and 
affiliations through which the people act in 
political matters. M. Poincare describes the 



static aspects of the French government ad- 
mirably, but he has little or nothing to say 
of those not less important aspects which are 
dynamic. It is true that the French party 
system is complicated and difficult to describe 
in brief and general phrases. But there is 
no good reason why there should not have been 
included in the present volume at least one 
chapter explaining how candidates for the 
Chamber of Deputies are nominated and how 
they carry on their campaigns, showing how 
party groups arise and act, and describing the 
organization and principles of a few of 
the more important groups, including the 
Socialists. 

On account of recent legislation raising the 
period of active, military service from two to 
three years, a portion of the chapter on mili- 
tary service is already out of date.

A MIDDLE-IRISH ROMANCE.* 



The twelve volumes already issued by the 
Irish Texts Society make a respectable show- 
ing upon any book shelf, and all students of 
literature ought to rejoice that extended docu- 
ments from the great storehouse of mediaeval 
Irish manuscripts are thus made accessible. 
Not that anybody is going to neglect the news- 
paper or the latest novel to read these me- 
diaeval Irish histories and romances. Of 
necessity the English translations in this pio- 
neer series must be scrupulously literal; and 
literal translations, even from languages 
which like French and German are more akin 
to ours than Irish, are seldom attractive to the 
general reader. This matters little. The 
material is accessible in trustworthy form, and 
many people will find that its novelty over- 
balances the tedium of a literal translation. 

This mass of Irish writing cannot lack sig- 
nificance to a student of literature. Literary 
influence, like electricity, passes from point 
to point in ways not obvious. The debt that 
English literature owes to Irish has not yet 
been estimated. But no one can doubt that 
such a debt exists. It is enough to recall that 
the beautiful story of "Sir Gawain and the 
Green Knight," the best of all English metri- 
cal romances, has a strictly Irish plot; that 
Queen Mab of "Romeo and Juliet" gets her 
name and characteristics from Queen Mtedb 
of ancient Connaught fairy-lore; that the 
Brendan legend appealed to Tennyson and 
Arnold, and that the Irish Finn Saga, trans- 
mitted by Scotch story tellers, and dimly

reflected in Maepherson 's Ossian, once set lit- 
erary Europe ablaze. It is within the bounds 
of possibility that these stories published by 
the Irish Texts Society may exert at some un- 
expected point an effect upon the letters of 
to-day. 

The text before us, "The Adventures of 
Suibhne Geilt," is well edited, and the intro- 
duction is good, although a connection urged 
between Merlin and Suibhne probably lacks all 
foundation. The story is told in prose, with 
poems interspersed after the manner usual in 
early Irish. Suibhne (Sweeny) was an Irish 
king of the seventh century, who incurred the 
curse of St. Ronan at the battle of Magh RJath, 
and in consequence went crazy (Geilt). In 
his madness he was perhaps transformed into 
a bird, or anyhow he believed that he was a 
bird, and could fly from tree to tree, and even 
accomplish long journeys in the air. Other 
maniacs in Irish and Scandinavian story have 
been credited with similar volant exploits. 
That some madmen, and some saints as well, 
possessed supernatural powers of leaping or 
flying was evidently a widespread belief, and 
a study of this supposed phenomenon of levi- 
tation is an interesting investigation which 
awaits some competent hand. 

Matthew Arnold long ago made us ac- 
quainted with the "natural magic" of the 
Celts. Although ' ' The Adventures of Suibhne 
Geilt" is by no means a fairy story, it is per- 
meated with natural magic. The mad king 
flits from tree to tree and from forest to for- 
est, and his wanderings in the open give a 
chance for the poet to express a love of out-of- 
door life, and a delight in the charms of this 
or that sequestered spot in Ireland. Nebuchad- 
nezzar dwelt with the beasts of the field and 
ate grass like oxen for seven years, ' ' until his 
hairs were grown like eagles ' feathers, and his 
nails like birds' claws." King Suibhne 's ad- 
venture reminds us of King Nebuchadnez- 
zar's; but unlike the more ancient monarch, 
Suibhne never recovers from his madness. 
The Irish story is also altogether separated 
from the Biblical narrative, because in it we 
inevitably take Suibhne 's point of view and 
sympathize with him in his joys and sorrows 
in the forest. 

King Suibhne sings to us of the frosty wind, 
and of the darkness of the trees' branches 
during winter's storm, of the squeal of the 
badgers, the bellowing of the stags, the yelp- 
ing of the foxes, the calling of the hounds, 
and again, when summer comes, of the clamor 
of the cuckoo. Even the water cress and the 
cold stream which supplied his food and 
drink he describes as fair and clean. This 
mediaeval Thoreau prefers the cooing of the 
turtle dove to the talk of people, the war- 



bling of the blackbird to the sound of the 
cloister bell, the cry of the mountain grouse 
to the voice of a beautiful woman, the chant 
of the hounds to the service of the church, and 
a couch among the branches to the softest bed 
in Ireland. The love and appreciation for the 
things of the forest, and the natural magic of 
the story, may appeal to the reader of to-day.

CHRISTIANITY ox TRIAL.* 



In his early days, Rudolf Eucken was 
keenly interested in religious problems; but 
in 1871, having been appointed Professor of 
Philosophy (first at Basel, soon afterward at 
Jena), he "sought to suppress the religious 
interest altogether," and devoted himself 
whole-heartedly to academic philosophy. A 
lesser man, under these circumstances, might 
gradually have ceased to have any functional 
relationship to the world at large; but such 
atrophy was not possible to Eucken 's ener- 
getic and sympathetic nature, and as he says, 
"the old interest would not die." In the 
course of forty years, in which he increasingly 
sought to connect his philosophical problems 
with the needs of human existence, the 
importance of taking a definite stand on re- 
ligious matters appeared continually more 
evident. Yet he held back, hoping that added 
years and experience would enable him to 
treat the subject more worthily. At length, 
however, he has felt free to write, realizing 
the approach of old age, and the probability 
that his powers will not increase. Thus, what- 
ever we may think of Professor Eucken 's 
opinions, we must at least accord them the 
respect due to the product of many years of 
labor, not offered hastily to create a sensation, 
but after prolonged consideration and recon- 
sideration. 

The groundwork of Eucken 's whole posi- 
tion is the proposition that human life has a 
spiritual side which gives it its real meaning 
and value. It is this postulate, in various 
forms, which gives validity to religion, and 
leads us to deny the adequacy of any mech- 
anistic conception of the universe. Although 
Eucken professes himself opposed to prag- 
matism, we find him justifying religion on 
genuinely pragmatic grounds, those of human 
necessity. It is not that God must be ap- 
peased, or that some plan of creation may 
be carried out, but that we, living creatures 
on this earth, may reach our proper estate 
and significance. It is not necessary to de- 
fine what we mean by "spiritual," all his-

tory and our own natures are eloquent as to 
that; nor is it difficult to prove that this 
quality is here, there, and everywhere in dan- 
ger of being crowded out of our lives. All 
this may be freely admitted, and still we may 
ask, why so much concern ? Has it not always 
been thus, from the dawn of history? Has 
not religion shown sufficient capacity for 
self-preservation? Are we to suppose that 
this ancient instinct, rooted in the very na- 
ture of man, is now in danger of extinction? 
Complacent natures may thus console them- 
selves, but even if the argument is valid, it 
still remains true that whatever of spiritual 
value has been won and held in the past, has 
been gained and retained at the expense of 
strenuous effort. Our Jena philosopher, at 
the very least, is successor to a long line of 
defenders of the faith, illustrious supporters 
of our most cherished traditions. 

The matter is, however, by no means so 
simple. The last century has transformed 
our manner of living and thinking, and the 
new wine will by no means remain in the 
old bottles. Consequently those who care 
for religion, but also love truth and respond 
to modern needs, find themselves between two 
hostile camps, that of the dogmatists and 
that of the materialists. It is impossible to 
abandon the very foundations of religion, 
and sink into a crass materialism, which car- 
ried to its logical end would destroy all we 
deem most precious. It is equally impossible 
to ally ourselves with the churches, which 
continue to defend statements which we can 
no longer believe to be true, and uphold doc- 
trines which offend our moral as well as our 
logical sense. Although our position is in a 
sense midway between these opposite ex- 
tremes, it is better thought of as representing 
a third corner of a triangle, as distinct and 
salient as either of the others. Such a posi- 
tion will be condemned by the materialists, 
who will urge that while we abandon the 
more obviously erroneous premises of cur- 
rent religions, we nevertheless adhere to their 
consequences, being unable to perceive the 
necessary connection. The orthodox relig- 
ionists will use exactly the same argument, 
except that they will affirm that the rejected 
premises are sound. Thus attacked from 
both sides, with essentially the same weapons, 
Eucken simply replies that the spiritual side 
of man exists, and did exist long before the 
present dogmas were invented; that (if the 
reviewer may supply an illustration not used 
by the author) the enemy's position is about 
as reasonable as that of a man who should 
maintain that there could be no such thing 
as gravitation, were we to believe that as a 
matter of fact the apple did not fall on 



Newton's head! At this point some would 
urge that since man's spiritual nature is in- 
herent and fundamental, it will take care of 
itself; but to this it is replied that it re- 
quires cultivating, and will not develop with- 
out effort ; and moreover, that success is not 
wholly a matter to be determined by the in- 
dividual, but must depend largely upon social 
conditions. Here we come to the question 
indicated by the title of the book: can we 
adopt as our own the Christian tradition, 
which has meant so much in ages past, and 
now seems to be on the wane? At first, the 
answer seems to be in the negative. We posi- 
tively must reject the fundamental Christian 
dogma, believing it to be untrue, and even 
incompatible with our present religious posi- 
tion. Is this, then, to exclude ourselves from 
Christianity altogether? Professor Eucken 
discusses at length the Catholic and Protes- 
tant churches, and decides that it is impossi- 
ble to seek alliance with either. There only 
remains, as a last resort, a Christianity out- 
side of the churches, a new Christianity which 
shall embody and transmit all the spiritual 
gains of the past, while rejecting that which 
is no longer of value. How this is to be de- 
veloped, the author does not clearly explain; 
but after all it is a fact that such a new 
Christianity does exist, and is in many subtle 
ways transforming the religious thought of 
the world. Professor Eucken has not offered 
us anything really new; he has merely set 
forth the existing situation in clear and un- 
mistakable language, calling us to sift the 
wheat from the chaff, sow it in the fertile 
fields of our minds, and look forward to a 
golden harvest. T. D. A. COCKERELL.

currents of History. Thomas Ritchie, of 
Scotch descent, but through his mother con- 
nected with powerful Virginia families, was 
born at Tappahannock in the Old Dominion, 
on November 5, 1778. After some legal edu- 
cation, some dabbling in Medicine, and some 
experience in teaching, Ritchie moved to Rich- 
mond in 1803, and the next year was selected 
under the patronage of Thomas Jefferson to 
edit the "Richmond Enquirer," newly estab- 
lished to present the true gospel of Repub- 
licanism in opposition to the Federalist 
"Gazette." Ritchie died in 1854. Thus for 
almost exactly a half a century did he con- 
tinue a clearly marked career as a journalist, 
a career in which he made himself a type, 
or one may say, the type of the ante-bellum 
Southern editor. In one great respect, he 
stood above the type. Most of the editorial 
profession used their position as a means to 
the attainment of political office: Ritchie 
always declined political preferment. Yet his 
biography is properly called : "A Study in 
Virginia Politics," for Ritchie, as Professor 
Ambler shows, dominated the political thought 
of his party in Virginia, and through his 
paper and his personal activities, expressed 
the wider influence of Virginia upon the 
Democratic Party in the South. Professor 
Ambler's work is not free from faults of exe- 
cution. In the earlier part of the book espe- 
cially the effect upon the reader is rather 
ammlistic. One has rather too much the im- 
pression that Ritchie's editorials have been 
strung together. There is a lack of unity and 
sequence. But as the work develops and as 
Professor Ambler makes increasing use of 
other sources than the "Enquirer," especially 
the manuscript collections in the Library of 
Congress, the treatment of the subject becomes 
more satisfactory. Throughout the book, un- 
fortunately, the presswork is bad and mis- 
prints abound; and there are mannerisms of 
style such as the grating repetition of ' ' True ' ' 
as a syncopated clause in the sentence. But 
neither faults in the organization of materials, 
misprints, nor stylistic idiosyncrasies seriously 
mar the value of the book. For it gives, per- 
haps, the best insight into the ramifications 
of Virginia politics, from the time of Ran- 
dolph, Marshall, and Roane, to the time of 
Rives, Tyler, Upshur, R. M. T. Hunter, and 
Stevenson, that is now available. More than 
this, the author follows Ritchie from his ser- 
vice in Virginia to his service in Washing- 
ton, where in 1845 Ritchie undertook the 
editorship of the "Union" then founded by 
the Democratic organization to support the 
administration of James K. Polk. The re- 
lation of this appointment to the preceding 
election of 1844 and to the difficulties which 



crowded Folk's term of office, and the rea- 
sons for Ritchie's comparative lack of suc- 
cess in the stormy years that followed until 
his retirement in 1851, form the closing topics 
of Professor Ambler's work; and the interest 
which attaches to these pages only serves to 
make one question if some space might not 
have been saved in the earlier part of the 
book for the fuller treatment of this later 
period. The work includes a few well-chosen 
illustrations, a genealogical appendix and an 
index, while in the preface the author indi- 
cates the chief sources which he has used.

graphical art worthy to enrich any case or 
cabinet. We will not go so far as to say that 
their physical appearance constitutes the sole 
claim of Mr. Gallatin 's two brochures, ' ' Whist- 
ler 's Pastels and Other Modern Profiles" and 
"The Portraits and Caricatures of James 
McNeill Whistler" (John Lane), on the con- 
noisseur's attention, or gains for them a ready 
and even warm welcome that they could not 
hope to receive on any other ground. For, 
obviously, in the former, at least, the author 
has satisfactorily performed a useful if minor 
task, and his purely ieonographical comments 
are in a good tone and competent. But cer- 
tainly it cannot be denied that, in that part 
of his work which at all pretends to criticism, 
the substance is very slight indeed. If it is 
possible to conceive of siich a distinction, Mr. 
Gallatin may be called the "master of the 
critical cliche." His style, such as it is, is 
almost wholly compact of the commonplace 
characterization, the trite turn of expression, 
the conventional phrase. And even for these 
he does not always stand sponsor but, with 
excess of caution, carefully introduces them 
between marks of quotation, as if to avoid any 
possible implication of rashness in the expres- 
sion of such extreme views ! Here, better than 
any further criticism or analysis of this style 
of Mr. Gallatin 's, is an admirably illustrative 
example of the author's magisterial yet minc- 
ing manner. The subject is Whistler's Vene- 
tian pastels. They, says Mr. Gallatin, "were 
an entirely new note in art : as in all the other 
various media he worked in, he not only mas- 
tered it, but developed its possibilities as well. 
Dr. Bode speaks of 'the neatness of execution 
and the beauty of coloring' of the great Ver-

meer, and how aptly these words [remarkable 
words I] could be employed in describing 
Whistler's pastels of Venice! . . . His sub- 
jects were always unhackneyed and treated 
in an entirely personal way. These pastels, 
with their amazing technique, the lines are 
broken, as in the Venetian etchings, possess 
that ' impress of a personal quality, ' as Walter 
Pater said of Luca della Robbia, 'a profound 
expressiveness, what the French call intimite, 
by which is meant some subtler sense of orig- 
inality the seal on a man's work of what 
is most inward and peculiar in his moods and 
manner of apprehension. ' The studies in black 
chalk which Whistler made of Venetian pal- 
aces, . . . contain as well as the pastels the 
' impress of a personal quality. ' ' By which 
we may infer, in the manner of a well-known 
humorist of the moment, that Mr. Gallatin 
regards Whistler's work as both original and 
exhibiting personality, only he doesn't quite 
like to say so right out ! And yet let us com- 
pliment the honesty of the writer whose con- 
science still requires him to refer back to 
Pater, (chapter, page, and paragraph almost), 
notions that have so long since become the 
common property of touch-and-go asstheticians. 

A few months ago we spoke 
briefly of the writings of Miss 
Margaret E. Noble, a gifted 
Irishwoman, who became a convert of the 
Swaoni Vivekananda and devoted the last 
years of her life to the task of winning occi- 
dental readers to a sympathetic appreciation 
of Hinduism. As a part of her work she had 
planned a volume that should give in con- 
densed form much of the Ramayana and 
Mahabarata and should also contain brief ac- 
counts of Krishna, Shiva, and Buddha. At 
the time of her death only about a third of 
the book had been written, and its completion 
was entrusted to Ananda K. Ooomaraswamy. 
The outcome of their labors is now presented 
in "Myths of the Hindus and Buddhists" 
(Holt), a generous volume of four hundred 
pages, in which are retold "almost all the 
tales commonly illustrated in Indian sculpture 
and painting." Of course the book is writ- 
ten for the general reader and not for the 
special student; but if it is judged on the 
basis of its own modest aims it may be said to 
fulfil its purpose laudably. Naturally, one 
must differ very often from the frankly 
advocatory estimate of the authors. For in- 
stance, we cannot quite acquiesce in the state- 
ment that the Ramayana is "surely the best 
tale of chivalry and truth and love of crea- 
tures that was ever w r ritten"; nor is it easy 
to enjoy and praise many features that would 
seem perfectly natural and beautiful to a mind

that has developed under Hindu influence. 
At the same time the effort to attain an alien 
point of view is always useful ; and from this 
work one may gather not a little knowledge 
of India's culture and religion. Perhaps the 
most striking feature of the volume is to be 
found in the illustrations by Indian artists 
working under the supervision of Abanindro 
Nath Tagore, C.I.E. All of them are sig- 
nificant; a few of them, remarkable. To the 
reviewer the pictures of "Buddha as a Men- 
dicant" and "The Final Release" were par- 
ticularly attractive, although a critic more 
thoroughly versed in Indian art might prefer 
some of the more recondite subjects. The 
material volume is pleasing throughout. 

Prisons and prison customs of 
the past, criminals and their 
ways, the desperate game that 
the felon plays against the constituted author- 
ities of law and order, the triumphs of de- 
tective skill, the horrors of the Spanish 
Inquisition, the butcheries of the Reign of 
Terror, the history of Botany Bay, the rela- 
tion between crime and superstition these 
and kindred themes are treated with an abun- 
dance of illustrative anecdote by Mr. Tighe 
Hopkins in "The Romance of Fraud" (But- 
ton). In the sixteen chapters of the book 
none is more readable than that describing 
some of the time-killing devices of the incar- 
cerated ; and among these interesting mention 
is made of some more or less notable works of 
literature produced in prison. The Abbe 
Lenglet Dufresnoy, who had made seven or 
eight involuntary visits to various State pris- 
ons, declared them "the best places in the 
world to work in. ' ' Whenever he was arrested 
he gave the summoning officer a cordial recep- 
tion, asking only for time to pack his linen, 
books, and manuscripts, after which he would 
send a note to his publisher: "You will have 
the book I am engaged on in a very short time 
now, for, under His Majesty's good pleasure, 
I am just being conducted to my study." 
Mr. Hopkins devotes a chapter to the escape of 
Colonel Rose and his companions from Libby 
Prison, a tale more fully told by American 
chroniclers, but not out of place as an in- 
stance of justifiable fraud on the prisoners' 
part.

attractive pamphlets in English were circu- 
lated, until to-day Americans swinging around 
the world generally plan to spend at least a 
fortnight in Java although they may pass by 
the equally attractive Philippines without a 
thought. Mr. Arthur S. Walcott has written 
an account of his fifteen weeks of travel in 
" Java and Her Neighbours " (Putnam). The 
book is designed primarily for the use of ' ' the 
ever-increasing army of travellers" and they 
may read for themselves how easy it is to 
travel in Java, how attractive are the hotels, 
how comfortable the railways, and how smooth 
the roads. And then when they would explore 
the ports of the "Outer Possessions" they 
may have recourse to the trim little ships 
of the Koninklijke Paketvaart Maatschappij, 
which, being interpreted, is the Royal Mail 
Company. Mr. Walcott visited practically all 
the show places of Java, including the botan- 
ical gardens, the native principalities, the 
Buddhist ruins, and the accessible craters. He 
cruised through the eastern islands, touching 
at Bali, Celebes, Borneo, Ternate, Bat j an, 
Amboyna, Banda, and others. And he finally 
visited the ports of West Sumatra and the 
beautiful Padang Highlands. But at no place 
did he attempt the unusual, or anything that 
the ordinary pleasure-seeking traveller might 
not easily do. ' ' I know of no regions of more 
lovely and more varied scenery," he tells us, 
"and of no lands where so much that is 
strange and unusual may be seen at so little 
risk and with so little discomfort. ' ' His book 
is the most helpful account of present travel- 
conditions in Java and the adjacent islands 
that is available in English, and the illustra- 
tions are exceptionally good. 



A. naturalist 
in the wild 
Northwest. 



A love of literature and a love 
of nature have combined to 
make Professor Dallas Lore 
Sharp one of the comparatively few natural- 
ists who can write natural-history books that 
are also works of literature of a high order. 
His latest volume, "Where Rolls the Oregon" 
(Houghton), contains eleven narrative chap- 
ters (not all new to his readers, but all well 
worthy of preservation in book form) of per- 
sonal experience amid the wild life and the 
snow-capped mountains of our great North- 
west. Younger readers may perhaps search 
the map in vain for the mighty stream that 
gives its name to the book, but that has for a 
good many years been known as the Columbia 
River. The change from the name immor- 
talized in poetry is to be regretted. Sea-birds 
and sea-lions, the raven of the Deschutes 
Canon, a motor-car journey through the 
sage brush, the fugitive life of the desert, 
the nearly-exterminated white heron of the 



marshes, an ascent of Mount Hood and the 
swarm of butterflies discovered at play about 
its summit, the cony and its rocky haunts, 
the mother instinct in birds and animals, and, 
finally, a closing word on the splendid mate- 
rial resources of vigorous young Oregon 
such, in brief, are the contents of this suffi- 
ciently varied and at the same time not 
ununified collection of studies and sketches 
picturing some of the things seen and heard 
and enjoyed in a summer's outing on or near 
the rolling Oregon. But our hasty summary 
has omitted the most thrilling chapter of the 
book, a description of the marvellous rescue 
of a vast herd of cattle that had stampeded 
in the night on the brink of a precipice, and 
that only the superhuman intelligence of 
Peroxide Jim, a horse of wonderful speed and 
pluck and initiative, saved from self-destruc- 
tion. "The Spirit of the Herd" is the name 
of the story a true one, we doubt not and 
it reveals a considerable knowledge of cowboy 
life on the writer's part. At the other end of 
his scale of accomplishments, he gives us, in- 
cidentally, an original translation from the 
Hebrew of a passage in Isaiah. Good illus- 
trations from photographs abound. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

The " Comprehensive Standard Dictionary " 
(Funk & Wagnalls) is an abridgment of the " New 
Standard Dictionary" which contains slightly less 
than 50,000 words. It should prove an easily han- 
dled reference book for use in schools and offices 
where a more complete work is not necessary. 

The fourth volume of " The Drama League 
Series of Plays " (Doubleday) is a reprint of Herr 
Hauptmann's " The Sunken Bell " in the English 
translation made by Mr. Charles Henry Meltzer 
some fifteen years ago. The critical analysis which 
is printed as an appendix is by Mr. Frank Chou- 
teau Brown. 

Of the seven new volumes of the " Loeb Classical 
Library " (Macmillan) which have recently come 
to hand, four belong to the Latin section. These 
include works of Horace, Suetonius, Tacitus, and 
Cicero. Professor C. E. Bennett of Cornell Uni- 
versity is the translator of the Odes of Horace; 
Dr. William Peterson of McGill University has 
translated the " Dialogus," the "Agricola," and the 
" G-ermania " of Tacitus ; Mr. Walter Miller has 
translated Cicero's " De Officiis " ; and Professor 
J. C. Rolfe of the University of Pennsylvania has 
translated Suetonius's "Lives of the Caesars." 
Only the first volume of this last book is published 
to date. Of the three volumes in the Greek sec- 
tion, two are devoted to a translation of " Dio's 
Roman History " by Dr. Earnest Gary, which is 
to be complete in nine volumes, and one to St. 
John Damascene's " Barlaam and loasaph," with 
an English translation by the Rev. Mr. G. R. 
Woodward and Mr. H. Mattingly.

A new volume of Mr. Eden Phillpotts's Dartmoor 
stories is to be called " The Judge's Chair." 

It is proposed to issue " Georgian Drawings," 
a collection of fifty reproductions of works by 
young English artists, through Messrs. Constable. 

The collected edition of Samuel Butler's works 
will be completed with "A Year in Canterbury 
Settlement and Other Papers," which will be pub- 
lished in the autumn. 

Mr. Clive Bell's defense of post-impressionism, 
"Art," which excited much interest in England 
early in the summer, will be published in this 
country by Messrs. Stokes within a month. 

The " Studies of Living Writers " series, an- 
nounced in England by Messrs. Kegan Paul, is to 
contain a biography of Mr. H. G. Wells by Mr. 
R. W. Talbot Cox, one of Mr. Arnold Bennett by 
Professor J. R. Skemp, and one of M. Anatole 
France by Mr. Geoffrey Cookson. 

Five new volumes will be added to the " Home 
University Library " shortly. Mr. J. M. Robertson 
has written the volume on " Elizabethan Litera- 
ture " ; Miss Edith Sichel the one on " The Renais- 
sance " ; Canon Charles the one on " Religious 
Development Between the Old and New Testa- 
ments " ; Professor Sheperd the one on " Central 
and South America " ; and Mr. Arnold Lunn the 
one on " The Alps." 

M. Pierre Champion has been awarded the Prix 
Gobert of 9000 francs by the French Academy for 
his biography of Francois Villon. Like M. Ana- 
tole France, M. Champion is the son of a learned 
publisher and bookseller, whose shop on the Quai 
Malaquais is often the meeting-place of famous 
scholars. M. Champion's book on Villon was sug- 
gested by the late Marcel Schwob, whose notes 
were placed at M. Champion's disposal. 

Mr. Elbridge Colby, of Columbia University, is 
writing a critical biography of Thomas Holcroft, 
member of the Corresponding Society with God- 
win and Paine. Holcroft was novelist, journalist, 
poet, critic, translator, dramatist, and editor by 
turns. He stole " Le Mariage de Figaro " for the 
English stage by committing it to memory while 
attending ten performances and producing an 
English version under the title of " The Follies of 
the Day."

UNDER A FOOL'S CAP: SONGS 

BY DANIEL HENRY HOLMES. 

Perhaps nothing that Mr. Mosher has 
printed in The Bibelot so awakened the 
immediate interest as did selections from 
Under a Fool's Cap, the name of whose 
author is now revealed as that of an 
American who saw fit to bring out his 
book in London, and thereafter did noth- 
ing in the shape of self-advertisement. 

We now reprint entire these lyrics, fash- 
ioned out of old tags of nursery rhymes, 
written with an originality and a proper 
regard to the quality of work rather than 
the quantity which is at once a rarity and 
a lasting delight. 

A brief biographical sketch, drawn from 
authorized sources, is given in a foreword 
by Mr. Mosher.

This pathetic little story was first issued 
by Mr. Mosher in a privately printed 
edition of 500 copies and was practically

Dr. Weir Mitchell in a letter to the owner 
of the copyright said among other things : 
"Certainly no more beautiful piece of 
English has been printed of late years." 
And again : " May I ask if this lady did 
not leave other literary products ? The 
one you print is so unusual in style and

it I felt convinced there must be other 
matter of like character."

(From a Review in the "Minneapolis Journal ") 

Lincoln as He Was 

The Everyday Life of Abraham Lincoln. By Francis F. Browne. 
Browne & Howell Co., Publishers, Chicago. 

THE material for this work, which was originally published thirty years ago, 
was collected from more than five hundred of the friends and contemporaries 
of Lincoln. So much has been written on the subject during the last generation 
that any new issue in the field owes an apology for its existence. The manner in 
which the present volume was prepared constitutes a more than sufficient apology. 
Here an attempt has been made to present Lincoln, the man, rather than Lincoln, 
the tradition; and the result might be characterized as an anecdotal life. 

" It cannot be doubted that the traditional Lincoln, as usually presented to 
school children, and which has become fixed in the mind of the average adult, is 
a rather highly sentimentalized concept. All the tremendous and tragic circum- 
stances surrounding the man were admirably suited to act as a distorting medium. 
A long and exhausting war is conducive to popular hysteria, as a result of which 
even the most level-headed men are likely to overstate; and the tragic death would 
tend to stifle the colder, more detached criticism. Added to these circumstances 
was the powerful appeal to humanitarian idealism involved in the emancipation 
of slaves. 

" In the greater number of writings on Lincoln, one cannot but note an almost 
total lack of the sober critical faculty. All witnesses seem to have vied with 
each other in exaltation. Nearly all testimony has a suspicious note of emotional 
abandon in it. It will probably never be possible entirely to separate the tradi- 
tional from the factual; but that critical-minded historian of the future who shall 
write the fairest possible appraisal of Lincoln's character shall be obliged to make 
use of Mr. Browne's volume; and therein lies its chief value as a source. Nor 
need any American patriot fear the result of that colder criticism which is 
inevitable. The present volume, in which Lincoln is much less of a sad demi-god 
'than in the conventional representations, shows how much greater a man may be 
in fact than in sentimental tradition. 

" Here is shown plainly, what has never been a secret and yet is persistently 
ignored, that Lincoln held out as long as possible against those who urged the 
abolition of slavery, issuing his proclamation only as a last desperate means of 
subduing the South. It was the master-stroke of a wise opportunist rather than 
the exalted deed of a humanitarian. And yet millions of children have been led 
to believe that the war was primarily a war against the institution of slavery, 
and that Lincoln's chief concern was with the freeing of slaves. Truly, he was 
opposed to slavery, but he constantly placed the preservation of the Union above 
abolition, believing that the latter should be accomplished by a slow process of 
purchase and colonization. That he thus proved his far-sightedness is apparent 
now when the negro question has become an issue of grave importance. There 
is much in the evidence here presented to indicate that, had he lived through the 
Reconstruction period, the negro would have been dealt with in a much more prac- 
tical way than that of the high-handed ultra-humanitarians who insisted upon 
regarding the negro as an Anglo-Saxon with a black skin. 

" Furthermore, we here see Lincoln as a possible human being, capable of losing 
patience, capable of petulance and anger, capable of making mistakes. And 
inasmuch as he is made to appear more the man and less the demi-god, by so much 
he looms the bigger and is the more intelligible to men."

THE LAST SHOT 

BY FREDERICK PALMER 

In this Time of War, this Novel is a Book of Immediate Importance 

A RECENT EDITORIAL IN HARPER'S WEEKLY SAYS: 

" ' The Last Shot ' appears at the psychological moment. Mr. Palmer probably knows more about actual war 
than any other novelist now writing, and very likely more than any other war correspondent now writing. Any 
general reader who goes through this story will have a much more filled-out picture of what a great modern war 
would mean than he could have had before. A notable quality in Mr. Palmer is that his intimate knowledge of war 
has not made him romantic about it, but rather the reverse ; and the terrible, machine-like butchery of modern 
methods is frightfully distinct. ... As an immediate and useful document, it stands high, and the greater its cir- 
culation the better for the formation of well-founded opinion about the meaning of war."

LORDS OF MISRULE. 



We have been reading lately a book on the 
new German literature by Percival Pollard, 
a meteor of American criticism, who dazzled 
and died a few years ago. It has something 
of the mingled vitriol and honey, irony and 
enthusiasm which makes Heine's "Romantic 
School" good reading after the lapse of 
three-quarters of a century. Like much re- 
cent criticism of note Pollard's work is im- 
pressionistic and it deals with the near and 
the new. "What is that plant?" an artist 
was asked, of some nondescript growth in his 
picture. "That is the foreground plant," he 
replied. "I use a great deal of it." So does 
the new school of critics. Values and dis- 
tance and aerial perspective may go hang for 
all they care. They fight shoulder to shoulder 
with the artists and writers who are forcing 
their way to the front, and perhaps their 
narrowness is a necessity. A phalanx has to 
be narrow to make any impression on 'the 
opposing ranks. 

Besides the lack of a sense of proportion 
which Pollard shares with most impression- 
istic critics, he has obliquities of outlook of 
his own. It is well enough for a critic to have 
certain objects or persons of dislike. It makes 
for lively writing. But the unprejudiced 
reader has a right to allow for such imperfect 
sympathies. Brahmins, we suppose, have 
bowels; American millionaires are, at least, 
vertebrate animals; and it is not actually a 
penitentiary offence to indite a "best seller." 
These are red rags, however, which excite Pol- 
lard to fury. 

1 1 is worst offence against the critical spirit 
is his belief that the literature he has in view 
is new and strange ; that its excesses are more 
excessive, its abnormalities more abnormal 
than have been known before. All literature 
is a study of abnormalities, which is only to 
say that it is a study of human nature. The 
absolutely sane, normal, standard human 
being is a myth. The derelictions of one per- 
son are to the right hand, the derelictions of 
another to the left. The enthusiasms of one 
seem insanities to another. "Everybody is 
queer but thee and me," said the Quaker to 
his wife, ' ' and I am not sure that thee is quite-

THE DIAL 



[August 16 



right. ' ' To anyone who is versed in the Revo- 
lutionary literature of a hundred years ago 
the work of Bierbaum, Wedekind, and Schnitz- 
ler, and their English and French contempo- 
raries, will seem but a minor eruption of the 
earthquake spirit. 

There has been, or is, however, a period of 
expansion, of explosion. The sun has its 
cycle when it cools and contracts in compara- 
tive peace, and then it has its cycle of sun 
spots, and so with literature. The long cool- 
ing period of the eighteenth century was 
followed by the tremendous outburst which 
preceded and followed the French Revolution. 
The shorter era which we denominate the 
Victorian Age has been broken up by lesser 
upheavals of the same sort, marked by the 
appearance of such writers as Zola, De Mau- 
passant, Verlaine in France, D'Annunzio in 
Italy, Shaw, Wilde, Wells in England, and 
the German writers we have named. It does 
not follow that the writers who best express 
the spirit of their age, whether that be one 
of contraction or expansion, are necessarily 
the best. Down through the ages goes a 
golden line of pure artists, who deal with the 
permanent elements of human nature and 
work with the enduring colors of art. Gray, 
Collins, Keats, Tennyson, even Goethe, Scott, 
and Dickens in their best work, are beyond 
or above the spirit of any age. 

The Greeks had their Dionysian myth with 
its recurring festivals; the Romans had their 
Saturnalia; the Middle Ages had their Lords 
of Misrule. Apparently humanity must at 
intervals either let off steam, or go mad. En- 
glish and German literature have been letting 
off steam at a great rate during the last 
twenty-five years. 

Nietzsche has been the philosopher of the 
period. In most things he was the pupil of 
Schopenhauer, but he had a more glancing 
and pungent way of putting ideas. Of course 
there is practically nothing new in his thought. 
There is enough revolutionary stuff in Emer- 
son to make a Nietzsche, but it was negatived 
and made innocuous by the conservatism and 
optimistic idealism in which it was wrapped 
up. Carry le preached the doctrine of the 
Superman though he did not use the word 
which really belongs to Goethe. 

Nietzsche revolted from Wagner because of 
two things: the latter 's trend toward relig- 
ion, even sacerdotalism, and his attitude 
toward woman. Women in Wagner always 



save the situation. They are the inspirers and 
regenerators of man. To Nietzsche, follow- 
ing Schopenhauer, they were little better than 
animals. "When you go among women, do 
not forget the whip," he said. In most mod- 
ern German poets and playwrights, and in 
a good many recent English novelists, there 
is an almost total abandonment of the angel 
theory of womanhood. We know from Tacitus 
that this fine respect for woman was a basic 
principle of Teutonic life. We know from the 
old Irish poems and Welsh legends that it was 
a dominant feeling in the Celtic race. It was 
the principle of Chivalry, and reinforced by 
the idealism of Dante and Petrarch has been 
implicit in all the higher literature of En- 
gland and Germany. Even Goethe, after 
Burns the most naturalistic as well as amo- 
rous of poets, holds a brief for the "Ever- 
womanly that leads us on. " The new writers, 
whether in prose or verse, will have none of 
this. They are just as frankly appreciative 
of the physical charms of woman as the old 
ones, but they do not look to her for light 
and leading. They are willing that woman 
should be as immoral as man, provided she 
gives him pleasure. As far as the making of 
literature is concerned, this theory is just as 
good as the other one. It is the theory of the 
whole East, it is largely the theory of an- 
tiquity. Poetry is always saved by sensuous- 
ness ; it is always damned by didacticism. In 
the point of view of life, however, the chiv- 
alric theory certainly seems the better one. 
Women may object, as many of them are 
doing to-day, to be set apart for goodness, 
to be elected as the elevators of man. But 
the horrible examples of their fate in the other 
direction which crowd the plays of modern 
Germany and the novels of modern England, 
would seem to indicate that they had better 
keep their place as goddesses if they possibly 
can. 

The turning away from religion and sacer- 
dotalism which Nietzsche voiced had more rea- 
son in it. The formalism of the churches had 
hardened into hypocrisy. The humiliations, 
the prostrations, the scourgings of the flesh 
which they inculcated weakened man's soul 
and body when they were practiced in reality ; 
and when they were a mere pretence made 
his life a living lie. Better the frankest ani- 
malism, the most ruthless trampling through 
the world, than this loss of initiative, this 
cloaked appearance. Of course the Super-

man is no new apparition in either life or 
literature. Napoleon only brings up the rear 
of a long line of conscienceless conquerors, 
and the Don Juans, Karl Moors, Manfreds, 
and Marmions are scattered over literature. 
But when there is a democratic outbreak into 
this field of human effort, when it becomes 
universal to be without religion or restraint, 
the thing is simpty impossible. The Super- 
man of the suburbs, the Demogorgon of the 
department shop are ridiculous figures. And 
man is a thing of form and fear. His life is 
short; the night is near; and if his need to 
worship something did not constrain him, his 
dread of the future would force him on his 
knees. Accordingly right 011 the heels of 
Nietzsche, the herald of chaos, comes Eucken, 
with his vitalistic mysticism and his preach- 
ing of redemption, and Bergson with his at- 
tempt to rear again the banners of Metaphysic 
which Science had banished to the rear. Berg- 
son's system is a strong effort for synthesis 
after destructive analysis had done its worst; 
.it is a struggle to know in the region where 
Science had said there was nothing knowable. 
But at bottom it is as material as the Science 
which it tries to displace or supplement. If 
there is nothing but Becoming ; if the stream 
of existence, ''which runs, and as it runs, 
forever must run on,-" is all; if there is no 
Being to act and be acted upon by this flux 
of things; if human life be only a series of 
unconnected moments; then immortality is a 
dream, and morality a matter of little moment. 
Woman's rights, Socialism, the uplift of 
the masses, questions of education, all those 
matters furnish material for contemporary 
European literature. And they are all lega- 
cies from the French Revolution or some re- 
moter day. It is as if humanity had only 
marked time in the interval, and had now 
suddenly started to keep step to the music 
of the past. The woman propaganda has 
hardly yet caught up to the programme set 
forth by Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin. Tom 
Paine, Godwin, Shelley, are still in advance 
of our most recent radicals. The community 
idea of property ownership has been promul- 
gated again and again. The discussion of 
all these things keeps the world from stagnat- 
ing, perhaps keeps oppression from becoming 
too bitter. Most of them will sooner or later 
be put into practice. But we doubt if any 
millennium will result, or any appreciable 
change in human conditions. 



We rather smiled in the beginning of this 
article at Pollard's pet prejudices; but in- 
deed we consider that his polemic against the 
spinelessness, the timidity, the insipidity of 
American literature, is the best part of his 
book. Mediocrity is written large over most 
of our contemporary work. We drive our 
artists in color and line abroad, and they, 
breathing the free intellectual air of Europe, 
develop until they loom large in the eyes of 
the world. But we condemn our stay-at-home 
men of letters to live in an atmosphere of 
dull provinciality which asphyxiates them. It 
is not that we do not know what is being 
thought in the larger world. We do not stop 
European ideas at our custom-houses, but we 
impose an internal tax on American thinkers 
and artists which crushes them into silence. 
The most advanced or outre European works 
are accepted with complacency by our readers 
or playgoers, but any approach to sensuous- 
ness by a native poet, any discussion of under- 
lying problems of life by a home thinker, any 
questionings as to the providential arrange- 
ment which imposes the Morgans and Rocke- 
fellers on us by a compatriot economist, are 
frowned down upon, and in fact cannot get 
themselves printed. Like the Queen of Spain 
the American woman has no legs, and our 
lords of finance control too many publications 
and churches and professional parasites to 
have their doings questioned. Meanwhile vul- 
garity and triviality and utter literary rot 
are rampant. The people who purvey this 
stuff get rich and the State rewards with 
Ambassadorships and high office the dealers 
in prose and verse twaddle or provincial plati- 
tudes. We had better let loose Lords of Mis- 
rule, like those who are working in Europe 
to-day, rather than rest in this mediocrity.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



LAW AND LITERATURE have their mutual 
affinities as well as their mutual antagonisms. 
Though as a rule our practising lawyers enter- 
tain a more or less unconscious contempt for 
''mere literature," there are noteworthy ex- 
ceptions jurists who brave the derision of 
their professional brethren by cultivating the 
muse in their spare hours. An eminent New 
York lawyer (his name will be found below), 
who has committed the indiscretion of writ- 
ing some excellent magazine articles, now has 
to submit to the jocosely ironical greeting from 



94 



THE DIAL 



[ August 16 



a brother lawyer of distinction, "Well, how 
is the poet to-day?" And another, who 
once delivered an address on the author of 
"Brahma," is referred to, with similar tire- 
some persistence, as "the Emersonian law- 
yer." Literature's debt to men of legal 
training is too considerable for more than the 
briefest passing mention here. Walter Scott's 
name alone is enough to prove that the study 
of Blackstone need not dry up the springs of 
poetry and romance. Indeed, Blackstone him- 
self is not without felicities of style. Lincoln, 
a lawyer of distinction long before he wrote 
his Gettysburg address, is now recognized as a 
master of pure and vigorous and at the same 
time graceful English. Choate and Webster 
are still read with enjoyment. One of the 
notable books of the present season, a book 
that no intelligent reader can fail to find in- 
teresting, is from the pen of a lawyer, Mr. 
Theron G. Strong's "Landmarks of a Law- 
yer's Lifetime." Another New York lawyer, 
Mr. Joseph S. Auerbach, has just given us, in 
two scholarly volumes, a collection of his 
"Essays and Miscellanies," wherein, both by 
example and precept, he renders noble service 
to the cause of careful and correct English. 
He is a college graduate of the old school, the 
school that knew not vocational training and 
bread-and-butter studies, the school that took 
its teachings in sentence-construction and the 
logical presentation of thought from the Greek 
and Latin classics. From this apostle of cul- 
ture let us quote, in closing, a few words on 
style: "Great thoughts and great emotions 
find their true interpretation, and are made 
manifest in the infinite variety of the style of 
illustrious, creative minds, as the several 
strings of a musical instrument are waked to 
harmony by the touch of the master. Style is 
not something separate and apart from the 
printed word, any more than in the concep- 
tion of the devout worshipper, is God Himself 
a being outside of and aloof from the throb- 
bing life of His universe; style is not mere 
ornamentation and adornment of the uttered 
thought, but its very soul. And it finds elo- 
quent and persuasive voice, only when, as 
though within a great temple, men consecrate 
themselves to the spirit of culture. ' ' 



WHY WE HAVE NO HIGH COMEDY, like Sheri- 
dan's "The Rivals" and "The School for 
Scandal," and Goldsmith's "She Stoops to 
Conquer," and many more of that old order 
which every veteran play-goer cherishes in 
fond remembrance, is explained by Mr. Clay- 
ton Hamilton in a preface to Sir Henry 
Arthur Jones's "Mary Goes First," lately 
published in the Drama League series. He 
says: "High comedy requires for its inspira- 



tion a social tradition that has been handed 
down for centuries. It has frequently been 
said that it takes three generations to make a 
gentleman; but it takes more than three to 
develop a comedy of manners. Manners do 
not become a theme for satire until they have 
been crystallized into a code; and, to laugh 
politely, a playwright must have an aristoc- 
racy to laugh at. The spirit of our people is 
inexorably opposed to the very idea of an 
aristocracy of birth ; we cannot have an aris- 
tocracy of wealth, since the phrase itself pre- 
sents an irresoluble contradiction in terms; 
and we have hardly yet had time to develop 
an aristocracy of culture. To all intents and 
purposes, the United States is still a country 
without an upper class, and the chaos of our 
social system precludes the possibility of 
social satire in our native drama. As Walter 
Prichard Eaton has pithily remarked, mast of 
our American comedies must be classed as 
comedies of bad manners. We laugh uproari- 
ously at impoliteness on our stage, because we 
have not yet learned to laugh delicately at 
politeness. We are amused at the eccentrici- 
ties of bad behavior, because we have not yet 
learned to be amused at the eccentricities of 
good behavior. High comedy is the last of. all 
dramatic types to be established in the art of 
any nation, and until we have had time to 
develop a native comedy of manners we must 
content ourselves with an appreciation of the 
social satires of our somewhat older cousins 
overseas. In this particular domain of art 
America is still a province of Great Britain. ' ' 
Not an immediately hopeful outlook for high 
comedy in America ; but as all things are pos- 
sible to genius, it may be that some brilliant 
native playwright will arise to refute the logic 
of Mr. Clayton Hamilton. 


FRENCHWOMEN WHO WRITE FOR A LIVELI- 
HOOD do not yet equal in number their pro- 
fessional sisters in England or in this country, 
but they are increasing, and their work com- 
monly has a style and finish not so often 
attained by the English or the American 
woman writer. In journalism, as the London 
"Times" Paris correspondent remarks, the 
women are making their influence felt more 
and more in France ; and one significant evi- 
dence that they take themselves seriously, and 
are taken seriously by others, in this work, is 
the fact that no woman writer for the French 
press is ever called a journaliste a term 
that would be deemed little short of defama- 
tory to her but she enjoys the distinction 
of being known as a femme de lettres or a 
collaboratrice. The subjects that a woman 
writer can handle better than a man are 
numerous, and she no longer shows herself

bashful about treating of those that prop- 
erly fall within man's domain. Some of the 
prominent women journalists, or "women of 
letters," mentioned by the "Times" writer 
are Madame Brisson, editor (or, if the less 
emancipated prefer it, editress) of "Les 
Annales, ' ' known for her work in aid of girls ' 
education, Madame de Broutelles, at the head 
of "La Vie Heureuse" and "La Mode Pra- 
tique," famous for her successful efforts to 
secure the dowering of a certain number of 
poor girls every year, and Mademoiselle Val- 
entine Thomson, who conducts "La Vie Femi- 
nine," a journal that bids fair to accomplish 
notable results in the field of women's work, 
especially in those departments having to do 
with hygiene and philanthropy. Other women 
journalists of Paris might be named who, as 
leader-w r riters, stand on an equal footing with 
men and receive the same material recognition 
of their ability. It may indeed be not far 
from the truth that, as one of these writing 
Frenchwomen expresses it, "en France la 
femme est presque omnipotente. " The Cail- 
laux-Calmette incident certainly reveals mo- 
mentous possibilities, not to say actualities, as 
to the Frenchwoman's influence in affairs of 
some importance. 

PRIMITIVE COLLEGE CUSTOMS, as occasionally 
referred to in time-stained letters or early 
memoirs, not seldom show an uncouthness 
and rudeness that encourage one to believe 
that the academic world really does move in 
the direction of better things. The recent 
publication of some century-old letters of 
Dr. Nathan Smith, founder of the medical 
schools at Dartmouth, Yale, Bowdoin, and the 
University of Vermont, reveals some curious 
fashions in student pranks a hundred years 
ago. Writing in 1814 from New Haven, where 
he had two sons at college, to his wife at Han- 
over, he says : ' ' We have lately had some diffi- 
culty in the School between the cooks and the 
scholars. A cook abused one of the scholars 
in the kitchen and the scholars put the cook 
under the pump and pumped him, as it is 
called. I think, however, it will be settled 
without much difficulty. Solon was one who 
helped to pump the cook, but so many assisted 
in the thing that the blame will be light on 
the individuals." Then, as now, there was 
safety in numbers where breaches of discipline 
were concerned. While quoting from this 
curiously interesting collection of letters, one 
is tempted to give a sample of the love-letters 
of that time by reproducing Nathan Smith's 
written proposal of marriage to the daughter 
of General Jonathan Chase, of Cornish, N. H. 
The letter is dated at Cornish, January 22, 
1794, and runs, without preliminary endear- 



ments, thus: "Sally: You will excuse the 
precipitancy with which I proceed in my en- 
deavors to accomplish my connection with you. 
I expected last evening to have set off for 
Hanover this morning, and I could not endure 
the least uncertainty till I returned, therefore 
I discovered my wishes respecting you to your 
Sire and Marm last evening, and they have 
generously given me leave to marry with. you. 
I hope I shall never meet with your disap- 
probation. Transported with Joy and Expec- 
tation I am Your sincere Lover, Nathan 
Smith." It is reasonable to infer that the 
charming Sally had already shown herself 
favorable to the ardent Nathan 's suit. 


THE SACRIFICE OF A NEAT BIT OF IMAGERY is 

one of the unavoidable consequences (ruth- 
lessly disregarded by those responsible) of 
the digging of the Cape Cod Canal, which was 
opened with appropriate ceremonies July 29. 
That gaping stretch of water, which now 
makes Cape Cod an island, does irreparable 
damage to the third paragraph of Thoreau's 
book named from the sandy pe'ninsula tra- 
versed by him three times and then made the 
subject of a memorable work from his pen. 
The paragraph reads thus : ' ' Cape Cod is the 
bared and bended arm of Massachusetts: the 
shoulder is at Buzzard's Bay; the elbow, or 
crazy-bone, at Cape Mallebarre; the wrist at 
Truro ; and the sandy fist at Provincetown, 
behind which the State stands on her guard, 
with her back to the Green Mountains, and 
her feet planted on the floor of the ocean, 
like an athlete protecting her Bay, boxing 
with northeast storms, and, ever and anon, 
heaving up her Atlantic adversary from the 
lap of earth, ready to thrust forward her 
other fist, which keeps guard the while upon 
her breast at Cape Ann." What might will 
there henceforth be in that "bared and 
bended arm" now that it is severed at the 
shoulder, and what protection can that ' ' sandy 
fist" afford to the bay it has so long guarded, 
now that the enemy is free to steal in behind 
that fist in the outrageous fashion made both 
possible and- easy by those who have so cruelly 
amputated the arm ? However, there may be 
a grain of comfort, of a utilitarian sort, in the 
reflection that what is poetry's loss is com- 
merce's gain ; and we still have, and are likely 
to retain, the consolation of the unimpaired 
pugilistic capabilities of that "other fist" at 
Cape Ann. . .

two pages, with frontispiece showing a part 
of the splendid collection, is the possession of 
Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel John P. Nichol- 
son, U. S. V., of Philadelphia. Colonel Nich- 
olson is Recorder-in-chief of the Military 
Order of the Loyal Legion of the United 
States, and the military library he has col- 
lected is in many respects worthy of the 
much-misused adjective unique. Nearly every 
important work is considerably extended by 
the insertion of autograph letters, rare plates, 
maps, and other illustrative material. The 
handwriting of Grant, Sherman, Sheridan, 
Meade, Thomas, McClellan, Pope, McDowell, 
Lee, Jackson, and others of note in connection 
with our Civil War, is to be seen in many an 
inserted letter or other document. Here, too, 
is preserved the original manuscript of one 
of the volumes of the Comte de Paris 's his- 
tory of this conflict; and Jefferson Davis 's 
inaugural address and his messages to Con- 
gress are here to be found, under a Richmond 
imprint, as also General Buell's notes on 
Shiloh, in his own handwriting. Grant's 
memoirs are enriched with his letter to Pem- 
berton, written at Vicksburg, March 2, 1863, 
and also with eighty-two plates, eight maps, 
and many clippings. Sheridan's memoirs, in 
a presentation copy, are extended to four vol- 
umes by the insertion of much valuable mat- 
ter, and Sherman's to eight volumes by a 
similar treatment. To those interested in the 
literature of warfare, and especially of our 
own struggle to preserve the Union, this col- 
lection is priceless ; and it is no wonder there 
is a feeling in Philadelphia that it should not, 
like the famous Lambert library recently dis- 
persed, be suffered to pass eventually under 
the auctioneer's hammer, but should be ac- 
quired by the city and preserved in a suitable 

building. 



BOY NATURE TWO THOUSAND YEARS AGO Was 

much like boy nature to-day. Boys are the 
stiffest of conservatives, and there is little if 
any change, from century to century, in the 
typical boy's unwritten code. As an illus- 
tration of the eternal boyish there has come 
down to us a Greek letter written on papyrus 
and dating back, it is conjectured, to the sec- 
ond or third century of our era. It was un- 
earthed on the site of Oxyrynchus, is now in 
the safe keeping of the Bodleian Library, and 
its contents, as already made public in trans- 
lation, are as follows: "Theon to his father 
Theon, greeting. It was a fine thing of you 
not to take me with you to the city! If you 
won 't take me with you to Alexandria I won 't 
write you a letter or speak to you or say good- 
bye to you; and if you go to Alexandria I 
won't take your hand nor ever greet you 



again. That is what will happen if you won't 
take me. Mother said to Archelaus : ' It quite 
upsets him to be left behind.' It was good of 
you to send me presents on the 12th, the day 
you sailed. Send me a lyre, I implore you. 
If you don't, I won't eat, I won't drink; 
there now!" To this lad the old adage evi- 
dently took a slightly modified form, "Vita 
sine musica mors est, " though we are left in 
darkness as to the issue of the threatened 
hunger strike. How the fond father must 
have chuckled at his young hopeful's tremen- 
dous earnestness of purpose and vigor of 
utterance! ... 

THE COWARDICE OF THEIR CONVICTIONS W3S 

signally displayed by those in session at the 
recent annual convention of the National Edu- 
cation Association when, after manifesting a 
friendly attitude toward the self-appointed 
simplifiers of our spelling, they refused to 
sanction the use of the simplified forms in the 
official publication of their own proceedings. 
An ideally simple and regular system of spell- 
ing, like an ideally logical and grammatical 
scheme of language, will be forthcoming in 
an ideally systematized and standardized 
(that is, an intolerably faultless) world, 
which, fortunately for us, we shall not live 
to see. Meanwhile the denaturizing of our 
orthography is discussed and urged, recom- 
mended to others and, with prudent forbear- 
ance, avoided in practice by most of those who 
theoretically favor it. One is reminded of the 
old fable of belling the cat a laudable enter- 
prise in the abstract, but presenting in the 
concrete certain insuperable difficulties. 



COMMUNICATIONS. 



GROCER-SHOP CRITICISM AND REAL 
CRITICISM. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
I have followed with some interest the discussion 
of " Literary Criticism in American Periodicals " 
begun by Professor Bliss Perry in the " Yale Re- 
view " and continued in a leading article on 
" Grocer-shop Criticism " in a recent issue of THE 
DIAL. Professor Perry brings a heavy indictment 
against periodical criticism in America; but after 
reading his censure and your comment, I find it 
easier than before to explain why criticism has 
with us risen to no higher levels. For while in a 
country which is, in the realm of ideas, one of the 
most conservative in the world, it is neither new 
nor surprising to find even so authoritative an 
organ of opinion as your own thrown into a panic 
when brought face to face with a new idea, still it 
is surprising if not new to find THE DIAL accept 
from, the pen of a distinguished scholar in our 
oldest university the theory that the processes of 



1914] 



THE DIAL,

literary criticism are the same as those which the 
grocer employs in weighing his commodities. 

Possibly it may be absurd to argue when the 
cause is so hopeless; but surely it must have 
occurred to you that the grocer's scales measure 
weight while the literary critic is concerned with 
quality, a thing not so easy to compute, even for 
grocers. Surely it must have occurred to you that 
while the weights and measures of a grocer are 
possible of minute ascertainment and universal 
acceptance, measures of criticism can never be 
stated with the same precision, or even if so stated, 
can never be certain of universal intelligence, not 
to mention universal acceptance. Pounds and 
bushels may be readily converted into kilograms 
all the world over, and may serve to weigh or 
measure Irish potatoes, Spanish olives, Arabian 
dates, and Chinese ginger; but I challenge THE 
DIAL to state its literary standards with such pre- 
cision as will make them applicable alike to the 
literary output of Ireland, Spain, Arabia, and 
China. Surely it must have occurred to you that 
while the grocer should aim at an external and 
mechanical standard wholly outside of the things 
which he measures, the mechanical and external are 
exactly what artistic standards should seek to 
avoid. Surely it must have occurred to you that 
while a grocer can weigh turnips just as well even 
.if he hates and despises them, and need never 
have tasted one in his life, the critic, on the other 
hand, must be called to his profession by a love 
of books, and can never judge rightly without real 
sympathy. Surely it must have occurred to you 
but I stand appalled at the thought of all the 
things that should have occurred to you before 
you committed yourself to Professor Perry's 
puerile metaphor of the grocer critic. 

The fact is (and it is so important that it must 
be stated clearly and frankly) that both you and 
he have a wholly vague and confused idea as to 
what criticism really means. I might pass lightly 
over the illustration from the grocer-shop, but one 
of the passages which you quote with approval 
from Professor Perry's article is unmistakable. The 
real difficulty, he says, is that Americans are inter- 
ested in " stock-market criticism," in " baseball 
criticism," in " political, social, and economic criti- 
cism," even in " musical or dramatic criticism," 
but not in the " criticism of books." Now, the 
first essential to any understanding of what criti- 
cism is, is to understand that the word when used 
in connection with " baseball criticism " or " po- 
litical criticism " has no more to do with the word 
" criticism " when applied to literature or other 
art, than a clothes-horse has to do with a real horse, 
or a geometrical circle with a literary circle, or a 
progressive euchre party with the Progressive 
Party, or a firing line with a line of verse. I am 
afraid that the confusion is hopelessly entrenched 
in our thought, but it is the duty of journals like 
THE DIAL and of scholars like Professor Perry to 
clarify such confusion and not to make it denser. 

I remember that a friend of mine, hearing of my 
intention to write a History of Literary Criticism, 
once suggested that I include in it a history of the 
critical spirit in all forms of intellectual activity, 
rather than merely a history of the criticism of 



books. The suggestion had an impressive sound, 
but it was no more valuable than a suggestion to 
include in a book on horses all the horsey things 
in the world, including race-track touts, horse- 
radish, clothes-horses, and hippopotamuses. An 
Italian scholar once attempted a task of this kind, 
and in the jumble of science, jurisprudence, eco- 
nomics, and " critical " philosophy, literary criti- 
cism is reduced to a sorry state. The criticism of 
literature is, first of all, a distinct and separate art, 
and involves the re-living in the critic's mind of 
the work which he is criticizing ; it involves, that is 
to say, a re-creation of the artist's work, before it 
rises above the work to become an act of judgment. 
It is only as a metaphor that this art may be said 
to have any connection whatever with the purely 
intellectual processes of " political, social, or eco- 
nomic criticism." It is this confusion which viti- 
ates the criticism of Matthew Arnold, from whom 
Professor Perry tamely receives it; and it is un- 
necessary to charge you with the same confusion, 
since you confess it yourself : " that THE DIAL has 
upheld this view for upwards of thirty years is 
well known to our (your) readers." 

This charge, you will understand, involves 
neither the probity nor the value of your practice. 
That THE DIAL has never yielded to the shameless 
puffery and dishonesty characteristic of so much 
periodical writing about books is incontestable. It 
has always stated its honest opinions about them. 
But honesty of opinion is not criticism any more 
than honesty of character is statesmanship. It is 
true that in our political life corruption has been 
so blatant and pervasive that our present concern 
seems to be rather with honesty than with states- 
manship; and it may be true that in our literary 
life our first concern now is with honest opinions 
rather than with creative criticism. If this is so, 
our periodicals are in the same stage of develop- 
ment as our politics ; but surely the day must come 
when honesty, alike in reviews and politics, will 
be taken for granted, and a search be made, not 
for honest writers or honest men, but for true 
critics and true statesmen. We shall prepare the 
way for that day when we clarify the concept of 
" criticism " and make it plain what criticism 
really is. 

There is one other confusion of thought which 
you share with Professor Perry, and which I 
should like to use this opportunity of making 
clear. I do not intend to defend what you are 
pleased to call my "foolish vaporings," but I think 
it only fair that you should permit me to clarify 
at least one point in my own doctrine which you 
apparently completely misapprehend. Your edi- 
torial, as I understand it, includes among other 
things a defence of critical judgment as an essen- 
tial element in the act of criticism, and you imply 
that in my lecture on " The New Criticism " I have 
thrown the idea of critical judgment to the winds, 
and invite the critic to enjoy without judging. 
Nothing could be clearer, however, than that this 
is not my point of view, and that I have insisted 
always that a critic must judge books as well as 
enjoy them. In my lecture I distinctly pointed 
out that the failure of modern impressionistic 
criticism consists in the very fact that it disre-

THE DIAL 



[August 16 



gards this element of critical judgment. I said 
then and I say now, that enjoyment and judgment 
always fall " short of their highest powers unless 
mystically mated, judgment erecting its edicts 
into arbitrary standards and conventions, enjoy- 
ment lost in the mazes of its sensuous indecision." 

There is no conflict, then, between you and Pro- 
fessor Perry on the one side and myself on the 
other, so far as the idea of judgment in criticism 
is concerned. We differ, however, in this, that 
you are willing to accept what I have called " arbi- 
trary standards and conventions" whenever they 
have come to us from the past, and I have made 
it the study of my life to find out exactly what 
these conventions are, and to point out in exactly 
what respect they are arbitrary and outworn. 
Among the instruments of criticism which I be- 
lieve to have been outworn in this way are the old 
empirical " rules " according to which classical 
criticism in a former age judged every work of 
art. A Latin poet like Horace, brought face to 
face with a new play, would have said, " This is 
a bad play because it disobeys the old rule that 
not more than three speakers shall be on the stage 
at any one time." A French classicist like Boileau, 
brought into contact with a new play, would have 
said, " This is a bad play because it disregards the 
old rule that the theme of every play shall not 
extend beyond twenty-four hours." An English 
reviewer like Lord Jeffrey, brought into contact 
with a new poem, would have said, " This is bad 
poetry because it disregards the old rule that an 
heroic couplet should come to a distinct close at 
the end of every two lines." And a Victorian 
American like Professor Perry, brought into con- 
tact with a new work of art, would in similar 
manner say, " This is a bad work of art because 
it disregards the rules which happened to be 
popular at the time when I received my academic 
education." 

If modern criticism has learned anything what- 
ever as the result of its self -searching during the 
last one hundred years, it has learned this: that 
arbitrary standards and rules have never deter- 
mined the merit of any work of art and never can 
determine its merit. So that looking about for a 
new and more vital method by which to test beau- 
tiful things, criticism has found it only in this 
the attempt, first, to discover what the artist him- 
self has tried to do, and then to judge his achieve- 
ment, not by any standards which the artist 
himself did not choose, but only by the goal which 
he himself set out to arrive at. We can no longer 
say to an artist, whether he be poet or painter: 
" Your work is not good because it disregards 
standards set for you by other people." We can 
say to him, and we do say to him if we are really 
creative critics : " You have attempted to do this 
or that, and what you yourself have tried to do 
you have apparently achieved, or failed in." 

Among the arbitrary standards and conventions 
which I believe to have dominated criticism too 
long, and which modern thought must eradicate 
from the whole field of critical thought and activ- 
ity, I indicated in my lecture on " The New Criti- 
cism " some of the more popular and authoritative, 
such as the application of a purely moral standard 



in the judgment of literature; the division of 
literature into different species or genres, such as 
lyric, comedy, tragedy, epic, pastoral, and similar 
vague abstractions; the theory of style, conceiving 
style as something separate from the work of art 
itself; the conception of the drama as a mechan- 
ical rather than a creative art, involving a knowl- 
edge of the rules of the theatre rather than the 
movements of the human heart; the idea of tech- 
nique as distinct from the essence of art itself; 
the theory of the influence of race, time, and 
environment on the work of men of letters; and, 
finally, the theory of the " evolution " of litera- 
ture. It may be that I have been mistaken in 
conceiving some of these theories to be arbitrary 
standards of taste, but that is not the main ques- 
tion involved. The main problem is merely this 
whether criticism should attempt to be creative in 
the sense of re-creating the artist's work in its 
own mind, and then, and only then, evolving its 
judgment; or whether it should unthinkingly hold 
to the old standards and conventions that have 
come down to us from the past, and mechanically 
accept a work of art only in so far as it agrees or 
disagrees with these traditional standards. The 
question at issue between us, then, is not whether 
the critic should judge literature, but how he 
should judge it; not whether he should forego all 
judgment, but whether he should judge rightly or 
wrongly ; in a word, whether the critic's touch- 
stone should be external and mechanical or internal 
and vital. 

Professor Perry, I think, has done me an injus- 
tice in summing up my position by quoting a few 
phrases of mine torn from their context ; and thus 
distorted, it may seem an easy thing to controvert my 
position even with the vague and graceful argu- 
ments of Victorian tradition. Many a Bohemian 
gathering, he says (I have not his article at hand 
and can merely paraphrase from memory), repeals 
the Ten Commandments in the fervor of midnight, 
only to find in the disillusion of the next morning 
that the Ten Commandments "will not budge." I do 
not intend to confuse the issue by being drawn into 
an argument that involves not only Biblical 
exegesis but the philosophy of history and the 
relativity of morals; but I must protest at having 
the ethical standards of a primitive folk imposed 
not only on universal history but on the criticism 
of all literature. It would be too obvious a retort 
to say that the Decalogue did budge between 
" Exodus " and " Deuteronomy," and budged still 
more before "Romans" was reached, where the Ten 
Commandments are actually reduced to four. It 
would be still easier to point out that there is not a 
single commandment out of the ten which has not 
been disregarded from Old Testament days to our 
own, and the disregarding of which has not been 
justified by the moral conscience of men, whether 
it be the edict against murder, disregarded for cen- 
turies in the code of the duello and to-day in the 
code of war; whether it be the edict against steal- 
ing, which has been disregarded and is still disre- 
garded by every nation on earth in our own 
time by England in the Transvaal, by Italy in 
Tripoli, by the Balkan States in Macedonia, and 
by the United States in Puerto Rico ; or whether 



1914 



THE DIAL 



it be any of the other of the Ten, which have never 
had the same consideration by men. 

But this, after all, is only a side issue; the 
important fact is that any comparison between the 
judgment of an act in practical life and the judg- 
ment of a work of art must inevitably be false. 
If there is one common concept which has ap- 
parently impressed itself on philosophic thought 
from the days of Plato to our own, it is that 
there is a fundamental distinction between the 
useful or mechanical arts on the one hand and the 
liberal arts on the other. Any comparison of the 
method of criticism with the method used in the 
practical conduct of life or in the mechanical 
operation of any of the useful arts and sciences 
must in itself be fundamentally false. There is 
then no connection whatever between the Deca- 
logue and the standards of criticism, and Professor 
Perry might have said with an equal appearance 
of truth, but an equal fundamental falsity, that 
many a Bohemian gathering repeals the Ten Com- 
mandments in the fervor of midnight, only to find 
in the disillusion of the next morning that 
cabbages do not grow on grapevines. 

If I were to attempt to sum up the whole matter, 
I should say this that art is simply the en- 
deavor of the human mind to express itself, to 
give shape in words or in marble or on canvas 
to its fancy and its imagination; and all that we 
can ask of it is that it shall be a true and vital 
expression. We cannot ask it to compete with 
practical life, or with utilitarian arts. We can 
simply say that since beauty is its own excuse for 
being, the imagination achieves its end when it 
expresses itself. No edict ever enunciated by the 
masters of criticism can hold water a single 
moment after a great work of art imposes its new 
beauty upon us. All we can ask of it is whether 
it has obeyed the laws which it itself has evolved 
in the moment of its creation not whether it 
has been true to others, but whether it has been 
true to itself. J. E. SPINGARN.

THE CARNEGIE FOUNDATION AND 
DENOMINATIONAL COLLEGES. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
An article in THE DIAL for July 16, headed "A 
Live Wire," has much with which the present 
writer can heartily agree. According to the most 
reliable accounts the President of the New York 
City Board of Education, Thomas W. Churchill, 
has shown himself wholly unsuited to such a posi- 
tion, and something more than the interests of 
the schools must have been behind Mayor Mitchell's 
action in reappointing him. In one paragraph, 
however, the writer of the article in question says 
of Mr. Churchill: 

" It was only the other day that he distinguished 
himself by a violent onslaught upon that worthiest of 
educational philanthropies, the Carnegie Foundation, 
on the ground, forsooth, that Mr. Carnegie does not 
choose to extend his benefaction to institutions that 
flout the very idea of a university by establishing 
sectarian tests for their teaching." 

To the latter part of this sentence I wish to 



enter most positive objection. It lumps in a single 
class the large number of educational institutions 
founded by religious denominations and not eligible 
to participation in the Carnegie Foundation, and 
characterizes them all as flouting the very idea of 
a university by establishing sectarian tests for their 
teaching. If the writer of this indictment had 
looked over a list of the institutions thus charged 
with sectarian narrowness and contempt for uni- 
versity ideals, he would have found therein more 
than one institution entitled to high rank as uni- 
versities, using the term in its strictly technical 
sense, as distinguished from the college, devoted to 
undergraduate work. (It must be remembered, 
however, that the Carnegie Foundation is open to 
colleges as well as to universities.) 

But the list of institutions cut off from partici- 
pation in the Carnegie Foundation fails to tally 
with this indictment not merely because it in- 
cludes genuine universities, of high order. It 
includes also a large number of colleges against 
which the charge of sectarian narrowness in their 
teaching is wholly unjustified. It is a well-known 
fact that a few institutions have passed from the 
excluded to the accepted list by technical changes 
in their charters, occasioning no change whatever 
in the spirit, purpose, or content of their class- 
room work. Others which could have accomplished 
the same end with just as little change have re- 
frained from doing so because of a desire to avoid 
even the appearance of a willingness to sacrifice 
principle for material gain. These colleges which 
do not receive the benefit of Mr. Carnegie's pension 
fund have educated a large share of the men now 
composing the faculties of the colleges and uni- 
versities which do receive that benefit. The nar- 
row-minded man is found occasionally on either 
side of the line. His narrowness has its roots in 
the frailty of human nature, not in his connections 
as a Presbyterian, a Progressive, a Protectionist, 
or a Pragmatist. His narrowness may break out 
at any point, and it may rage all the more nar- 
rowly in the institution that concerns itself least 
with the individual beliefs of its teachers. A 
governing board may occasionally be narrow- 
minded. This, however, is the exception, not the 
rule, and it takes no very exhaustive research to 
unearth the fact that board narrowness is not con- 
fined to one side of the Carnegie Foundation line. 
Mr. Carnegie, of course, had the right to his own 
selection of institutions which he would aid. I 
am not offended by his choice, though I do believe 
that he would have made it on a different basis but 
for a false idea of the real nature of most American 
denominational colleges. I do not like to see THE 
DIAL, which has stood always for keen insight and 
broad sympathy, contribute to the spread of that 
false idea. W. H. JOHNSON.

THE IRONY OF THE ENTENTE CORDIALE.* 



A Liberal member of Parliament, in a recent 
anxious and somewhat tumultuous session of 
that legislative body, declared with some heat 
that the best that could be said for the Entente 
with France after eight years was that it was 
going to land England in a war simply be- 
cause a few German soldiers wanted to cross 
Belgium. He might easily have given stronger 
emphasis to the irony of the Anglo-French 
understanding. Because of the mad act of a 
Servian fanatic a great nation at the other 
extremity of Europe finds herself involved 
in a tremendous conflict as the ally not only 
of the country with which her African inter- 
ests brought her to the very verge of war 
not many years ago, but also of the empire 
whose rapid expansion has been a long-stand- 
ing and ever-increasing menace to that nation 
in the East the empire, too, that came so 
near to open hostilities with this western- 
European power by reason of the Dogger 
Bank incident in the course of the Russo- 
Japanese war. 

An account of the origin and growth of the 
present friendly relations between England 
and her hereditary foe across the Channel has 
just appeared from the pen of him who has 
done more than any other one person to pro- 
mote those highly desirable relations. ' ' Thirty 
Years," by Sir Thomas Barclay, is made up 
chiefly, as its sub-title indicates, of "Anglo- 
French reminiscences," covering the years 
1876-1906. It was in 1876 that Sir Thomas, 
not yet knighted and hardly more than a boy, 
entered the service of the London "Times" 
and was sent to Paris where he was, of course, 
subordinate to the mighty Blowitz, whose jour- 
nalistic prestige was even then beyond dispute, 
or at least he stood second only to Emile de 
Girardin. Born in Bohemia, of obscure Se- 
mitic origin (though he was fond of proclaim- 
ing himself a, Slav), he spoke with some 
fluency, but "with a rolling Slavonic intona- 
tion, ' ' as his one-time associate and friend tells 
us, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. 
His English, curiously enough in one holding 
so important a position on the foremost En- 
glish newspaper, is said to have been execrable. 
He could not even distinguish between "How 
do you do?" and "Good-bye," but jumbled 
the two comically in his greetings, often using 
them both in the same breath. A few further 
words descriptive of his peculiar genius may

Mifflin Co. 



be not unwelcome before passing on to less 
personal matters. 

" Blowitz had the adventurer's love of the 
wealthy and powerful. In him, poverty or failure 
excited no pity, and one who afforded him no copy 
was a ' nobody,' the lowest rank to which a man 
could descend. A criminal on a large scale excited 
Blowitz's imagination, and he dwelt with an almost 
friendly interest on rascality that amounted to 
genius. In those days Blowitz was a journalist, 
and nothing but a journalist, devoted to The 
Times body and soul, and ready to sacrifice his 
very life to his professional duty." 

Through President Grevy 's son-in-law, Dan- 
iel Wilson, of Scottish paternity, though not 
of Scottish birth as is Sir Thomas Barclay, the 
latter gained a footing of some intimacy with 
the Grevy household, and became a frequent 
guest at the Thursday lunches to which the 
President invited his closer political friends. 
"It was at these lunches," says the author, 
"that I laid the foundation of those political 
associations ww r hich afterwards enabled me to 
secure support for the Entente, where it might 
otherwise have been difficult. ' ' 

Sir Thomas's connection with "The Times" 
was severed in 1882, when he resigned his 
place in order to devote himself to French law 
practice ; and since 1900 he has taken a most 
active part in the agitation for amicable rela- 
tions with France. But as early as 1894 he 
drew up what he calls "a plan of action on 
how to make England and France friends," 
a schedule now published by him in his book 
and bearing marks of thought and insight. 
With the opening of the new century he saw 
what he considered a favorable opportunity 
for starting the movement. Let the story be 
told as far as possible in his own words. 

" I believe I once heard ' luck ' defined as a 
courageous insight into the capabilities of a chance. 
At any rate, I have always so regarded luck. 
Chances of all kinds and qualities abound. The 
difficulty is just to distinguish among them. I was 
on the lookout for a chance to launch the great 
idea that England and France by their geograph- 
ical position, by their political affinities, by their 
differences of character which made them indis- 
pensable to each other's intellectual development, 
by the divergency of their industrial and artistic 
activity which made the one the complement of 
the other, had a joint and not a competing mis- 
sion in the world ; that they would benefit as much 
by their friendship as they were losing by their 
antagonism; that England and France as democ- 
racies, having nothing to gain by war, were neces- 
sarily agents of peace; and that their friendship 
would be a first step towards the abatement of 
those armaments which the Emperor of Russia in 
1898 had justly described as ' a crushing burden 
more and more difficult for nations to bear.' " 

Early in 1901 Sir Thomas was invited to 
deliver the address at the approaching annual 



1914] 



THE DIAL

meeting of the French Arbitration Society, 
and though there was a very small attendance 
owing to an unusually severe snowstorm, the 
occasion turned out to be little short of epoch- 
making, thanks to the action of the "Figaro" 
in publishing the address after its editor had 
all but refused to give his endorsement to 
what he characterized as merely a beautiful 
dream. Other newspapers all over France re- 
printed the speech, and the leading British 
journals gave it their attention, but in every 
instance with a caution that showed each to 
.be waiting for some one else to add the appro- 
priate word of assent or dissent. Nevertheless 
the speaker was so far encouraged that, as he 
tells us, he made arrangements to devote all 
his time and means henceforward to his self- 
imposed task. It was the French peace socie- 
ties that gave him the first emphatic support; 
then followed endorsements from chambers of 
commerce and trade associations, and soon the 
movement had gained considerable headway. 

" My life for the next two years was one of 
wild activity, a life of sleeping in trains, speaking 
sometimes several times a day, sometimes twice in 
one evening. I invented (oh, mother necessity!) 
a quick-change shirt, a quick-change l dickie,' a 
quick-change tie, a travelling bag adapted to my 
requirements, and at all times packed and ready 
for use at a moment's notice. In America it 
amused my friends to see me turn into evening 
dress, quite decent enough to pass muster, in ten 
minutes." 

This activity was not without gratifying re- 
sults. After much public discussion and par- 
liamentary deliberation the convention or 
agreement of April, 1904, was signed, and 
there dawned upon Europe what the prime 
mover in this momentous business was pleased 
to regard as a new era. He himself received 
numerous tributes in recognition of his public 
services: the King conferred a knighthood, 
France made him an officer in the Legion of 
Honor, and congratulatory letters from emi- 
nent men in both countries poured in upon 
him. His activities had extended even to our 
own quarter of the globe, and here he had 
made many friends in the course of his 
advocacy of more cordial Anglo-American re- 
lations. His " fellow- townsman of Dunferm- 
line, " as he calls Mr. Carnegie, was of course 
one of these, and Secretary Hay was another, 
some notable words from whose lips the writer 
takes occasion to record. "Mr. Hay one day 
observed to me," he says, "that the Fathers 
of the Constitution had made a deplorable mis- 
take in investing the Senate with executive 
powers, for it simply meant that the Secretary 
of State passed his life with discouragement 
in his soul and anger in his language." 

Curiously significant at the present time be- 



comes the semi-official assurance of the ' ' Nord- 
deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" to the German 
public, soon after the signing of the agree- 
ment, that there was no cause for apprehen- 
sion in the Anglo-French understanding ; and 
it is perhaps provocative of a satirical smile 
to recall the Kaiser's Bremen speech of March 
22, 1905, in which he described the German 
Empire (we quote from our author) as "a 
quiet, honest, and peaceful neighbour; and 
added that if ever history should come to 
speak of a German world-wide Empire, or a 
world-wide dominion of the Hohenzollerns, 
this empire, this dominion, would have been 
founded upon conquests gained not by the 
sword but by the mutual confidence of those 
nations which press towards the same goal." 
In Germany, as in France, Sir Thomas Bar- 
clay let his voice be heard in favor of friend- 
lier relations with England. He has also 
exerted his influence to promote industrial har- 
mony, being the founder of the International 
Brotherhood Alliance and a vigorous sup- 
porter of arbitration and conciliation in all 
trade disputes. With what feelings he con- 
templates the present glaring signs of retro- 
gression in the affairs of international peace 
and industrial concord may be surmised. They 
cannot be feelings of unmixed satisfaction. 

Not to leave with the reader the impression 
that the book under review is a mere record 
of peace-promotion, it should be said in clos- 
ing that the writer 's pages abound in anecdote 
and incident and character-sketch, in the re- 
production of many a shrewd or witty remark 
from persons of eminence, in observations and 
reflections on a great variety of matters, 
chiefly of public interest, and in evidences 
of various kinds that show the author to be 
both a many-sided man of the world and also 
an accomplished scholar and man of letters. 
He it was who with a number of French 
friends successfully urged the formation in 
Paris of a Shakespeare committee to cooperate 
in the proposed Shakespearean celebration two 
years hence, a committee headed by M. Ana- 
tole France as president d'honneur and not 
lacking in other distinguished names. It is 
to be noted in passing that, as a consistent 
Liberal, he is strongly in favor of woman 
suffrage, as he demonstrated when he was in 
Parliament not long ago. 

"Thirty Years" is a thoroughly interesting 
book, and a timely one, though its timeliness 
is partly of a sort not at all expected or de- 
sired by its author. A variety of appended 
matter, a good index, and a frontispiece por- 
trait from a water-color drawing, complete 
the volume's equipment.

Ax AMERICAX ENCYCLOPEDIA OF 
HORTICULTURE.* 



The subject of horticulture has never 
reached the stage of general interest in the 
United States that it attained long ago in 
England. We have developed horticulture 
largely in its commercial aspects, but the cul- 
tivation of plants just for the pleasure of 
cultivating them and of associating with them 
has not appealed very strongly to the Ameri- 
can, who prefers to buy what he wants with 
the minimum trouble. But the development 
of parks and country places has begun to 
change this sentiment, and plants are coming 
into their own, not merely as sources of food, 
but as sources of pleasure. The publication 
of a great work on horticulture, therefore, is 
timely, and should go far toward stimulating 
further an interest that is already aroused. 

Bailey's "Cyclopedia of American Horti- 
culture" began to appear in 1900, and the 
four volumes were completed in 1902. It was 
intended to be a complete record of North 
American horticulture as it existed at the 
close of the nineteenth century. For more 
than a decade, therefore, this work has been 
the standard authority upon the plants cul- 
tivated in North America, and upon the 
methods of culture. During this decade, how- 
ever, the horticultural interests of the United 
States and of Canada have become much ex- 
tended, not only on account of the tropical 
connections that have been established, but 
also on account of the greatly increased inter- 
est in the introduction of foreign plants. The 
somewhat provincial horticulture of the 
United States has disappeared, and the whole 
world has been laid under tribute for plants 
suited to our extremely diversified conditions. 

In addition to this, the interest in the culti- 
vation of plants has extended beyond flowers, 
vegetable gardens, orchards, and field crops, 
and includes now woody plants, from shrub- 
beries to forest plantations. Not only has 
there been a great change in the scope of 
horticultural operations, but methods of plant- 
breeding have developed with remarkable 
rapidity during the last decade. The enor- 
mous amount of experimental work in genetics 
and in soil studies has resulted in practical 
applications that have revolutionized many 
of the methods of obtaining and handling 
plants. 

It is obvious that the old Cyclopedia was 
sadly out of date, and had become a valuable 
historical record rather than a presentation 
of the horticultural interests of to-day. For- 
tunately, the editor decided to let the old work 

* THE STANDARD CYCLOPEDIA OF HORTICULTURE. Edited by 
L. H. Bailey. New, rewritten, and enlarged edition. Volume 
I., A-B. Illustrated. New York : The Macmillan Co. 



stand as a record, and to prepare an entirety 
new one, new in its scope and in its title, 
"The Standard Cyclopedia of Horticulture." 
Although prepared from the American stand- 
point, the geographical limitation disappears 
from the title, since it could not and should 
not be observed. The new work will be com- 
plete in six volumes, and this increase in size 
is some indication of the great increase in the 
magnitude of the subject. 

In the former Cyclopedia, the plants treated 
were largely those "sold in the United States 
and -Canada. ' ' This means that one consult- 
ing the lists of nurserymen, seedsmen, etc.,' 
could find in the Cyclopedia an authoritative 
statement in reference to the plants offered 
for sale, and suggestions as to culture. The 
new work accepts this basis in general, but it 
is interpreted to include also the offerings of 
European dealers to the American market. 
Species no longer of interest to horticulturists 
are excluded, for "dead entries" would make 
the work too voluminous and would not serve 
its purpose of being a current, record. Of 
course, many plants cultivated in botanic gar- 
dens, public parks, and private grounds will 
not be found in the new Cyclopedia. A quo- 
tation from the preface states compactly the 
general aim of the work : 

" The Cyclopedia aims to account for the plants 
horticulturally grown within its territory which are 
now the subjects of living interest or likely to be 
introduced, to discuss the best practices in the grow- 
ing of the staple flowers and fruits and vegetable 
crops, to depict the horticultural capabilities of the 
states and provinces, to indicate the literature of 
the field, and incidentally to portray briefly the 
lives of the former men and women who have 
attained to a large or a national reputation in horti- 
cultural pursuits." 

Concisely stated, the new Cyclopedia has 
two main purposes: (1) the identification of 
species, so that one may recognize the cultural 
plants he meets; and (2) the cultivation of 
plants, so that one may know the approved 
methods of growing plants for different pur- 
poses. The first purpose can be carried out 
very definitely arid precisely, but the second 
purpose is beset with difficulties. The cul- 
tural conditions in North America are as nu- 
merous and varied as are the assemblages of 
native plants. Directions for one region can- 
not apply to all regions, so that competent 
plant-breeders in one region may contradict 
equally competent plant-breeders in another 
region. The editor, therefore, calls attention 
to the fact (and it needs emphasis) that no 
one can grow plants by a book. He can read 
statements of standard practice, but with this 
as a basis, he must experiment with his own 
conditions. Every one who grows plants suc- 
cessfully, therefore, must have enough initia-

tive to be more or less of an experimenter, 
to whom the experiences of others are sug- 
gestive, but for whom his own experience is 
final. 

The introductory matter in the first volume, 
which comprises 180 pages, as contrasted with 
nine pages in the old work, is another illustra- 
tion of the larger scope of the new work, which 
seeks to serve more people in more ways. 
There are pages of "explanations" which 
enable the users of the work to understand 
abbreviations, authorship, keys, etc. An en- 
tirely new feature, extending through seventy- 
eight pages, is "A Synopsis of the Plant 
Kingdom, ' ' by Mr. Karl M. Wiegand, which is 
a very complete, illustrated outline of the 
classification of the plant kingdom, from the 
thallophytes to the seed plants. Of course the 
vascular plants receive the most attention. To 
those who are familiar only with the few 
plants under cultivation, this marshalling of 
the whole plant kingdom will be most impres- 
sive, and they will also be able to see where 
the plants they know fit into the general 
scheme. 

Then there is a key to the families and 
genera, which, with its index, comprises about 
seventy pages. This was certainly a laborious 
and difficult undertaking, and evidently the 
editor consented to include it only under pres- 
sure. It is intended to help the cultivator of 
plants to determine the name of any plant 
cultivated in America, including also the wild 
flowers commonly offered for sale. In other 
words, it is a manual of the cultivated and 
more common wild plants of America. Those 
who have prepared manuals will appreciate 
what such a task involved. The test of a key 
comes in using it, so that no one can tell in 
advance whether this key will serve its pur- 
pose or not. 

One of the interesting helps provided is a 
long list (twelve pages) of the English equiva- 
lents of Latin names of species. Most spe- 
cific names mean something characteristic of 
the plant, but to most persons the meaning is 
not obvious, so that this list of translations 
will be very helpful. Then, of course, a glos- 
sary is necessary in using keys and reading 
descriptions. 

This introductory manual, occupying nearly 
two hundred pages, is really an introduction 
to an intelligent use of the Cyclopedia for 
those who have had no training in botany, 
and many who are growing plants success- 
fully have had no such training. 

The first volume begins with Abaca and 
closes with Byrsonima, and most of the titles 
are signed, so that responsibility is fixed. The 
titles are exceedingly variable, including not 
merely the names of cultivated plants, but 



also general topics. For example, such topics 
are treated as alpine plants, annuals, ants, 
aquatics, arboretum, arboriculture, autumn 
colors, bees, biennials, birds, botanic gardens, 
breeding of plants, British North America, 
etc. 

A single illustration may be used to show 
the method of treatment in the case of culti- 
vated plants. Under Apple will be found 
twenty-one profusely illustrated pages, treat- 
ing this important fruit from every point of 
view. After a preliminary historical state- 
ment in reference to the origin of apples in 
general, and noteworthy varieties, and also an 
account of the general range and method of 
cultivation, apple-growing in different regions 
is discussed, with an account of the favored 
forms, the cultural methods, and the impor- 
tant enemies. The apple regions discussed 
separately are Northeastern states, Canada, 
Southern Alleghany Mountain region, Mid- 
continental or plains districts, Western moun- 
tain states, Oregon and Washington, and 
California. Such a presentation will be a 
mine of information to every one interested 
in apple-growing in any region. 

It is needless to comment upon the fitness 
of Professor Bailey to undertake the direction 
of this great work. No one else has had so 
extensive a grasp upon general horticulture 
for so long a time; so that any presentation 
that organizes his experience may be taken as 
an authoritative presentation of horticulture 
as it exists. This does not mean necessarily 
horticulture as it might be and will be; but 
it does mean that this record of horticulture 
as it is omits nothing important and states 
each situation with full knowledge.

HEROIC Vii>L,Arvs.* 



Is there a well-defined class of plays in 
which the roles of villain and hero are 
merged? If so, where did this sort of play 
come from ? What is the origin of the villain- 
hero 's character, and what appeal does he 
make to us ? How must he be drawn to inter- 
est us most deeply? These are some of the 
questions that Dr. Boyer tries to answer in 
his present study, which was written as a 
thesis for the doctor's degree at Princeton. 
The title of the book at once suggests difficul- 
ties of classification. Dr. Boyer of course uses 
' ' hero ' ' in the sense of ' ' protagonist. " " Vil- 
lain" he discusses at some length, finally 
arriving at this definition: "a man who for 
a selfish end wilfully and deliberately violates 
standards of morality sanctioned by the

audience or ordinary reader." This is not 
altogether satisfactory ; it would seem for in- 
stance to include Antony, though Dr. Boyer 
maintains that Antony "is not a villain be- 
cause he is not trying to advance his own 
interests." This quibble suggests that the 
test for villainy is going to raise some nice 
points in casuistry ; and it does. Take the 
case of Vindici in "The Revenger's Tragedy," 
a clear example, according to Dr. Boyer, of 
a villain-hero. Technically he can be brought 
under the definition ; but it is safe to say that 
he did not appear a villain to the Elizabethan 
audience, and would not so appear to a mod- 
ern reader if the reader were not searching 
for plays of the villain-hero type. Certainly 
he is not the villain of the piece; in fact he 
is on the whole the least villainous person in 
it, and his cruel vengeance would be fully jus- 
tified by Elizabethan ethics. Or consider 
Macbeth, who also in Dr. Boyer 's catalogue 
is writ down a villain. No doubt he becomes 
one in the course of the story; but he is not 
in any sense a villain when he wins our sym- 
pathy ; and this simple fact, not considered by 
Dr. Boyer, makes a great difference in the 
dramatist 's problem. 

The question who is the protagonist would 
seem less likely to cause trouble; but the de- 
sire to magnify the importance of the villain- 
hero type of play has led Dr. Boyer to regard 
the villain as protagonist of several impor- 
tant plays in which the chief interest and sym- 
pathy of the audience is claimed by some other 
character. "Othello," for instance, is in- 
cluded because it is "a play with two protag- 
onists." This very fact should have warned 
the author that it is not to be treated as if it 
were in the same class with "Richard III."; 
yet he calmly proceeds to test lago by the 
standards he has derived from Richard. Per- 
haps the clearest instance of the distorted 
criticism which results from forcing plays into 
a class where they do not belong is the case 
of "The Duchess of Malfi." "The Duchess of 
Malfi" is a powerful and brilliant story play, 
intensely tragic in tone. "Cymbeline" would 
be its nearest analogue, if the tragic element 
in "Cymbeline" had received more emphasis. 
In both plays the emphasis is more on story 
than on character; in both the heroine is the 
most interesting person, and the next in inter- 
est, by a long remove, is the villain. If you 
can imagine what would happen to "Cym- 
beline" in the hands of a critic who regarded 
it as a villain-hero play with lachimo as pro- 
tagonist, you will have a tolerable idea of how 
Webster's play fares at the hands of Dr. 
Boyer. He regards Bosola as the hero, and 
complains that "he is not great enough," he 
has "no grandeur of soul," he lacks "the in- 



trepidity and brilliance of a Richard. ' ' Why 
not f He was never intended to be a Richard. 
But your critic with a theory is always con- 
demning things for not being what they were 
never intended to be. 

Aside from such distortions due to bad clas- 
sification, the chief weakness of the book is its 
tendency to regard poetic justice as essential 
to good drama. On this point the author's 
attitude wavers somewhat, but in general he 
seems to feel that at least the virtuous should 
not be allowed to suffer too much, and the 
scoundrels should be made conscious that 
their sins have brought adequate punishment. 
"No tragic effect is produced" in the "Re- 
venger 's Tragedy, ' ' for instance, because ' ' the 
truth is not driven home that the fate of the 
guilty is any more inevitable than that of the 
guiltless." The reader feels like inquiring 
where this "truth" is "driven home" in 
' ' Lear " or " Othello. ' ' So also ' ' Measure for 
Measure" is severely criticized because the 
Duke's solution of the difficulty "is not cal- 
culated to restore a respect for law, nor is it 
in the slightest degree appropriate to Angelo's 
wickedness. Our sense of justice is outraged. ' ' 
This is the old, old fallacy of Shakespeare 
criticism, which persists in spite of exposure. 

On the whole Dr. Boyer has failed to show 
that there is a distinct class of villain-hero 
plays with its own peculiarities of technique. 
Plays with this characteristic seem to have 
little else in common ; and most of them could 
be more satisfactorily classified elsewhere. He 
has failed also in his attempt to connect such 
plays with Seneca. None of the plays dis- 
cussed shows any relation to Seneca's "Thy- 
estes" or "Medea," in which Dr. Boyer 
thinks the type originated ; only one of them, 
and this one of the least important, shows any 
direct Senecan influence. The early plays on 
the Senecan model do not, even in Dr. Boyer's 
judgment, belong to the villain-hero type ; and 
the early plays which he regards as of this 
type are not at all Senecan. But he has suc- 
ceeded in making an interesting study of dif- 
ferent kinds of villains; what he has to say 
of the development of the revengeful villain, 
for instance, is extremely suggestive, though 
we may not be able to agree with his view of 
lago as the perfect exemplar of the type. A 
greater merit is his clear account of the in- 
fluence of the Machiavellian or pseudo-Mach- 
iavellian ethics upon the Elizabethan villains. 
He shows pretty conclusively that "Machia- 
vellism" on the English stage is largely 
traceable to Gentillet's " Anti-Machiavel, " 
published in 1576 and translated by Simon 
Patericke in the next year. Lorenzo in ' ' The 
Spanish Tragedy" and Marlowe's Barabas 
established the type for the stage, and were

followed by a long series of "Machiavellian" 
villains. This is much the most valuable part 
of the thesis, and it was on this line that Dr. 
Boyer's investigation began. But he was led 
astray by the will-o'-the-wisp of a definite 
villain-hero type of play, and by the wish to 
show that Aristotle was wrong in saying that 
the fall of a bad man into adversity cannot 
be tragic. Now in all Dr. Boyer's list there 
is only one possible exception to Aristotle's 
dictum, ' ' Richard III. " " Macbeth ' ' is not 
an exception; for it is not the fall of a bad 
man which makes "Macbeth" tragic, but the 
suffering and ruin of a man originally good 
and great. "Richard III." has seemed to 
some critics an exception, but is it really one? 
Is it not strong and brilliant melodrama rather 
than tragedy? Surely the emotions it rouses 
are not of the same kind as those inspired by 
"Hamlet" or "Lear." Nevertheless, Dr. 
Boyer thinks, it inspires awe, pity for the 
waste of great powers, and fear of the force 
of evil personified in Richard; and these, he 
maintains, are tragic emotions. But even if 
we admit his point, and it is open to attack, 
one play is a rather narrow foundation for 
an important addition to the theory of tragedy. 
Two or three slips in proofreading may be 
worth noting: Cynthio for Cinthio (p. 116) ; 
Lassurioso for Lussurioso (p. 151) ; and Ar- 
treus for Atreus (p. 178).

REPRIXTS OF SAMUEL BUTLER.* 



It seems fairly evident that the "seventy 
years of immortality" which Samuel Butler 
predicted for himself are now, twelve years 
after his death, well under way. This result 
has been brought about largely through the 
attractive new editions of his chief works 
which have been appearing at intervals for 
several years past. The most recent of these 
are "The Humor of Homer" and "The Fair 
Haven." 

The sub-title of the latter volume bears a 
forbidding aspect: "A Work in Defence 
of the Miraculous Element in our Lord's 
Ministry upon Earth, both as against Ra- 
tionalistic Impugners and certain Orthodox 
Defenders, by the late John Pickard Owen, 
with a Memoir of the Author by William 
Bickersteth Owen." But let the uninitiated 
reader not be deceived. There is much juicy 
reading even here. This grave and magnifi-

cent fiction proves Butler to be the legitimate 
Elisha to those two eighteenth century Elijahs 
of irony, DeFoe and Swift. Indeed there is 
a very close connection between DeFoe 's 
"Shortest Way with Dissenters" and "The 
Fair Haven." Both are works of ironical 
orthodoxy which had a success almost past 
belief. Humor must have been dead in the 
Church of England in 1702, that so many 
loyal souls welcomed seriously with pious joy 
DeFoe 's suggestion to hang every Dissenter. 
And it must have been sorely afflicted in 1873 
when Canon Ainger derived such comfort 
from Butler's argument that, since Strauss 
admitted the death of Jesus and other heretics 
admitted that he was seen alive after his 
supposed (but fictitious) death, the whole 
orthodox position was historically vindicated. 
Forty years have passed; yet this book of 
theological controversy is remarkably up-to- 
date, and is furnishing material for current 
popularizations of a view which in the me- 
dieval seventies must have represented its 
author, to the devout who chanced upon it, 
as a creature horned, hoofed, and damned. 
The editor points out in his introduction to 
the new edition an interesting relation be- 
tween this successful irony and Butler's ob- 
security during his lifetime. Reviewers, he 
says, who had been taken in by "The Fair 
Haven," "fought shy of him for the rest of 
his life. . . . The word went forth that Butler 
was not to be taken seriously, whatever he 
wrote, and the results of the decree were ap- 
parent in the conspiracy of silence that 
greeted not only his books on evolution, but 
his Homeric works, his writings on art, and 
his edition of Shakespeare's Sonnets." This 
opinion seems altogether plausible; some- 
thing like the fact is antecedently probable 
in order to explain how a writer of Butler's 
force, humor, and perspicacity should require 
discovery by the generation following his own. 

But even when handled by the most viva- 
cious, theology has few charms for the present- 
day general reader, who cares very little 
whether Strauss or Butler or Dean Alford 
was right. And so the other of these two 
reprints, ' ' The Humor of Homer, ' ' will prove 
of immeasurably greater interest. A valuable 
feature is the Memoir by Mr. H. Festing 
Jones, which though written only to do tem- 
porary service until Mr. Jones's full work 
on Butler appears, is nevertheless the best 
account of Butler's life at present available. 

The contents of the volume, consisting of 
two lectures before the Working Men's Col- 
lege, London, one before the Somerville Club, 
and a number of short essays contributed to 
"The Universal Review" during 1889 and 
1890, show Butler at his miscellaneous best.

THE DIAL 



[August 16 



As one would very naturally expect, the three 
essays entitled collectively ''The Deadlock in 
Darwinism" are the poorest. It is the anomaly 
of Butler 's life that a writer of his humor and 
sense of proportion should have seriously de- 
voted a large part of his life to pseudo-scien- 
tific haggling over Darwinism. Perhaps this 
is only a post factiim judgment, incited by the 
fact that Butler, so modern in theology and 
art and criticism, is yearly growing more 
antiquated in science. 

' ' Thought and Language ' ' is better reading, 
as well as a more convincing scientific docu- 
ment ; but it does not approach the interest we 
find in the papers on art, especially ''The 
Sanctuary of Montrigone" and "A Medieval 
Girl School." In the intelligent levity which 
characterizes Butler's treatment of mediaeval 
church art there is nothing of the ill-nature 
that one cannot miss at times in his contro- 
versies, and especially in his novel, ' ' The Way 
of All Flesh," where the fallacies are too 
near to be treated with urbanity. In the 
paper on "A Medieval Girl School" he takes 
occasion to justify or explain his apparent 
cynicism : 

"And after all, what is the essence of Chris- 
tianity? What is the kernel of the nut? Surely 
common sense and cheerfulness, with unflinching 
opposition to the Charlatanisms and Pharisaisms 
of a man's own times ... [It is] in speaking the 
truth, in finding the true life rather in others than 
in oneself, and in the certain hope that he who loses 
his life on these behalfs finds more than he has 
lost ... I should be shocked if anything I had 
ever written or shall ever write should seem to 
make light of these things. I should be shocked 
also [and here we find his mind reverting to the 
Black Virgins of mediaeval art, the satire in the 
Iliad and so on] if I did not know how to be 
amused with things that amiable people obviously 
intended to be amusing." 

But let us come finally to the best. "For 
mere reading," says Butler in "Quis Desi- 
derio . . .?" "I suppose one book is pretty 
much as good as another." To this gentle 
judgment we must demur, for the first three 
papers in this volume are far and away the 
best for ''mere reading" that Butler offers. 
True, ' ' The Humor of Homer ' ' contains some- 
thing besides "mere reading." In it is found 
the core of his later work on ' ' The Authoress 
of the Odyssey," as well as considerations, 
not found elsewhere in his writings, concern- 
ing the broad humor of the Iliad, in its treat- 
ment of women and of gods especially. We 
may not here discuss Butler's attractive 
theory in regard to the Homer of the Bated 
Breath, but we find it highly amusing, very 
saving to the face of the poems, and worthy 
of some serious investigation. 

"Quis Desiderio . . . ?" and "Kamblings 



in Cheapside" are quite the most delicious 
bits of fooling since Swift's time. The com- 
ment on Wordworth's "Lucy," in which from 
the information that Lucy's death made a 
considerable difference to the poet, and the 

" And few could know 
When Lucy ceased to be," 

he builds up the theory that Lucy was prose- 
cuting AVordsworth for breach of promise; 
whereupon the poet, abetted by Southey and 
Coleridge, murdered her, this is altogether 
worthy of Isaac Bickerstaff and his prediction 
of the death of Partridge the astrologer. 

There are three Samuel Butlers. If ' ' Erew- 
hon" had been a racehorse it would have 
been got by "Hudibras" out of "Analogy." 
Years ago the present reviewer tried to under- 
stand the bygone satire of the former, and 
for one whole term of school tortured himself 
by crawling out of bed at four in the morn- 
ing to learn the "Analogy" by heart (ironical 
phrase, for the heart was not in the work). 
And with these superior advantages, he claims 
the right to prefer the Samuel Butler who 
wrote "Quis Desiderio . . .?" to either of 
the others.

finish and there are books which I have so 
far escaped finishing. But I must in honesty 
admit that a novel must interest' me very much 
before I can read it on a train. I almost always 
have a novel with me during the fifty minutes 
morning and evening that I spend in getting to 
and from the city and I almost never read it. 
All of the six novels below have had the op- 
portunity of that fifty minutes and none of 
them has been equal to it which is only to 
say that when I did read them it was rather 
more as a duty than as a pleasure. 

Mr. William Hewlett's new novel, "Tell- 
ing the Truth," falls just short of being as 
interesting as the moving panorama to be 
seen from my train. Its flippancy of tone 
strikes one at once as annoying rather than 
as amusing. One of the early pages, in which 
the first-person narrator is telling of an occa- 
sion during his boyhood when he was so 
affected by the beauty of a scene in Kent as 
to ejaculate that it was a "ripping place" is 
an example of Mr. Hewlett 's quality : 

" I wanted to expatiate on its beauties, to de- 
scribe the picturesque aspect of the village green, 
the duck pond, the quaint red-roofed cottages, the 
distant woods on fire with November sunshine, the 
spirit of tranquillity and aloofness brooding over 
the place. But all eyes were upon* me. I was 
a schoolboy. Something mildly humorous was 
expected of me. Like the comedian in a panto- 
mime, I had to ' get my laugh.' All this, or some- 
thing like it, passed through my mind in a flash, 
and I answered : ' We found a jolly tuck-shop 
there.' There was a general laugh, as I had known 
there would be, but it woke no triumphant echo in 
my childish breast. My brother turned away with 
a ' pooh P of banished interest. I knew that I had 
failed, that I had not done myself justice, that I 
had been the veriest slave of convention. And, 
what was worse, I knew that he didn't know it. 
That was the most damned mortifying part of the 
whole business!" 

None of the remaining five novels is much 
worse or much better than Mr. Hewlett's. 

Mr. Leroy Scott, who once wrote a novel 
about a labor leader or the like, has conceived 
"No. 13 Washington Square" in the vein of 
broad farce. The complications of which the 
story is made centre about a leader, or more 
precisely, the leader of New York society. 
Mrs. De Peyster could not make her annual 
trip to Europe because her railroad failed to 
declare a dividend so she planned secretly to 
spend an economical summer in her Fifth 
Avenue residence. Her plan would have 
worked better than it did if her son had not 
made a similar one. She had disinherited him 
because he wanted to go to work. He had 
immediately married the nice but ineligible 
girl he was in love with. The two, having 
every reason to believe the family mansion 



deserted, thought to spend their honeymoon 
in it. Such a plot finds its best use on the 
stage. The let-down at the end since the 
more elaborate the scheme the more disap- 
pointing the final solution is inevitable. 

Mr. Edginton's novel is a more imaginative 
farce than Mr. Scott's. It depends not so 
much on complications although these are 
achieved as on an idea. How farce does 
gain by an idea! Mr. Edginton's immoder- 
ately successful British business man suffered 
the double misfortune of a perfect wife and 
an innocent heart. She simply would not 
spend his money. When he could stand it no 
longer he found other young women who 
would. Nobody believed that his relations 
with these young persons were innocently 
avuncular. Even his wife's first thought was 
of divorce though her second was a happier 
one. The whole is a kindly, humorous com- 
ment on the struggle between the sexes, 

"The Lights Are Bright" is old-fashioned 
romance with a villain, a hero, and a beautiful 
young woman who needs three hundred pages 
in which to discover her own mind. That the 
setting is in some respects contemporary 
steel mills in the foreground and the Missabe 
range in the background is incidental. 

Miss Webster's novel is a serious attempt. 
The "sheep track" is the conventional way 
of upper middle-class society. Her reaction 
to it is reasonable rather than vigorous. She 
understands how necessary it is to most of 
those who travel it, how dangerous it is to 
those who cannot or will not follow it, and 
how misleading it is to young persons pos- 
sessed of fine instincts, or energy, or special 
capacity. But she has no satisfactory idea 
of the sort of persons to be found in the sheep 
track; those she presents are not much to the 
point. Her heroine is an attractive girl 
and that is well. An attractive girl adds as 
much to the possibilities of a serious novel as 
to those of a farce or a Victorian romance. 
Indeed, it might be shown that the creation of 
an attractive young woman is possible only to 
the serious novelist. But I am most unwilling 
to talk about "creation" in connection with 
a novel like "The Sheep Track." 

Mr. Leonard Merrick's boom has by now so 
flattened that I may speak of him in kindly 
terms without being understood to regard him 
with awe. "When Love Flies Out o' the 
Window," a novel several years old in En- 
giand but now published on this side for the 
first time, is competently done that is all. 
It is briskly yet nicely written but it drops 
easily into the incredible ending. Novels are 
not made by so amenable a talent.

be expected in a "journal" proper there are 
memoranda suggested by reading, and count- 
less notes that seem to have no reference to 
the especial day. As the publication of the 
correspondence with Carlyle called attention 
to the fact that Emerson was not great as a 
letter- writer, so these journals emphasize the 
fact that he is not eminently a diarist. Notes 
of facts and pregnant comments thereon are 
not wanting; but the former are often dryly 
concise, and the latter rarely reveal much of 
the author. Only occasionally do we find a 
passage like this from the last volume, which, 
notwithstanding its length, must be quoted 
for its content and its charm of phrase. 

"Yesterday, May 23, we buried Hawthorne in 
Sleepy Hollow, in a pomp of sunshine and verdure, 
and gentle winds. James Freeman Clarke read the 
service in the church and at the grave. Long- 
fellow, Lowell, Holmes, Agassiz, Hoar, Dwight, 
Whipple, Norton, Alcott, Hillard, Fields, Judge 
Thomas, and I attended the hearse as pallbearers. 
Franklin Pierce was with the family. The church 
was copiously decorated with white flowers deli- 
cately arranged. The corpse was unwillingly 
shown, only a few moments to this company of 
his friends. But it was noble and serene in its 
aspect, nothing amiss, a calm and powerful 
head. A large company filled the church and the 
grounds of the cemetery. All was so bright and 
quiet that pain or mourning was hardly suggested, 
and Holmes said to me that it looked like a happy 
meeting. . . . 

" I thought there was a tragic element in the 
event that might be more fully rendered, in the 
painful solitude of the man, which, I suppose, 
could not longer be endured, and he died of it. 

" I have found in his death a surprise and dis- 
appointment. I thought him a greater man than 
any of his works betray, that there was still a 
great deal of work in him, and that he might one 
day show a purer power. Moreover, I have felt 



sure of him in his neighborhood, and in his neces- 
sities of sympathy and intelligence, that I could 
well wait his time, his unwillingness and caprice, 
and might one day conquer a friendship. It 
would have been a happiness, doubtless to both 
of us, to have come into habits of unreserved inter- 
course. It was easy to talk with him, there were 
no barriers, only, he said so little, that I talked 
too much, and stopped only because, as he gave 
no indications, I feared to exceed. He showed no 
egotism or self-assertion, rather a humility, and, 
at one time, a fear that he had written himself 
out. One day, when I found him on the top of his 
hill, in the woods, he paced back the path to his 
house, and said, ' This path is the only remem- 
brance of me that will remain.' Now it appears 
that I waited too long." 

Notwithstanding an occasional entry like this 
the student who hoped that the publication of 
Emerson's Journals would reveal the secrets 
of his personality was destined to disappoint- 
ment. Unlike other diarists, he never shows 
himself for a moment in undress. There is no 
pose, no indication of self-consciousness; the 
fact that he did not show himself more fully, 
that apparently he could not do so if he would, 
constitutes the baffling peculiarity of his na- 
ture. If the Journals are disappointing in 
their revelation of biography and personality, 
they may also to some be disappointing in 
their contribution to our knowledge of Emer- 
son's philosophy. They give much data from 
which to trace his intellectual development, 
but there are frequent gaps to be supplied. 
It was in these manuscripts that the author 
first jotted down many of the sentences that 
he afterward used in lectures and essays, and 
it is a proof of the sureness of his taste that 
those which he chose for use are usually better 
than those which remain for publication now. 
In the ten volumes are of course hundreds of 
worthy thoughts, strikingly expressed; but 
one may sometimes read for pages without 
finding as many telling phrases as he will meet 
in one paragraph of the Essays. This state- 
ment of what the Journals do not give is but 
a warning to the reader who might expect 
too much, or expect the wrong things. They 
offer, if not so intimate a revelation of the 
man as we might wish, the best revelation we 
shall ever have. To the careful student of 
almost any topic connected with Emerson they 
are rich in material that can be found no- 
where else, and every lover of Emerson should 
be grateful for their publication. 



Wanderings 
with Milton. 



There is something pleasingly 
old-fashioned about Mr. Alden 
Sampson's "Studies in Milton" 
(Moffat). The author has obviously long 
steeped his mind in his subject, and in much 
that is even remotely connected with it, after

THE DIAL

a leisurely, brooding fashion quite exceptional 
to-day among American writers of "books 
about books" though still flourishing in En- 
gland (witness the latest works of Mr. Stop- 
ford Brooke). Such concern for Milton, 
particularly, is valuable in America at the 
present time; since our general attitude of 
mind is surely, in these days, more remote 
from Milton's, and more in need of what his 
can give us, than it has been in the past or is 
again likely to be. Not altogether desirable, 
however, is Mr. Sampson's complete freedom 
from a certain nervous consciousness which 
leads the average present-day writer, in grap- 
pling with a great classic, to mass the most 
striking of his own views in the foreground, 
carefully deprecating minor points and his 
debts to previous critics. For the "Studies" 
evince not enough distinction of style and 
personal viewpoint to carry their leisurely 
method with real success. This fact is un- 
fortunately thrust upon the reader near the 
very beginning of the first and most im- 
portant of the essays, "From Lycidas to 
Paradise Lost," when he is confronted, in 
connection with Milton's early sonnet to the 
nightingale, with ten pages of comment upon 
the poet's not very characteristic admiration 
for this bird, which had become so conven- 
tional a figure in Renaissance poetic scenery. 
In this connection, too, our author makes the 
surprising error of treating Satan's tuneful 
temptation of Eve in her dream (Paradise Lost, 
Bk. V., 1. 35ff) as "Adam's love-song to his 
new-found bride"; no such love-song occurs 
or is mentioned in the course of the poem. The 
reader should not infer from this instance, 
however, that the author has read his Para- 
dise Lost altogether skippingly, in search of 
passages to illustrate his points. The essay 
proceeds to take up in chronological order the 
remaining sonnets produced during Milton's 
so-called middle period, endeavoring to relate 
each very fully with the poet's personality, 
his life, and his greater works. Sometimes 
the relationships expatiated upon are too far- 
fetched. For instance, although one must feel 
continually in Paradise Lost the fervor of 
the Puritan rebellion, one does not like to be 
told explicitly that "it is Satan himself that 
most nearly presents a reflex of the great Pro- 
tector, " and to have several splendid pas- 
sages of the poem quoted merely on this text. 
The second essay in the book, "Milton's Con- 
fession of Faith," more insistently illustrates 
the author's undue thirst for comparisons. 
The parallels he cites between Milton's relig- 
ious ideas and those of George Fox are often 
either too strained, or else too obvious for 
anyone acquainted with the common and quite 
natural methods by which the better minds 



of 



among the adherents of the reformed religion 
were endeavoring to rise above the ordinary 
level of Puritan dogmas. The third essay, 
on "Certain Aspects of the Poetic Genius," 
is a readable presentation (though devoid of 
originality) of what the title suggests, the cen- 
tral theme being the nature of Milton's own 
genius. 

Certainly there is room for a 
s. compact life of John Addington 

Symonds. The excellent biog- 
raphy compiled by his friend H. F. Brown is 
too expensive for the ordinary reader to own, 
and too full for his needs. Mr. Van Wyck 
Brooks has undertaken to supply the lack of a 
convenient short study with this little volume 
entitled "John Addington Symonds" (Ken- 
nerley). For his facts he relies chiefly upon 
Brown 's book, though he has made some use of 
the biographies and letters of Jowett, Steven- 
son, and other friends of Symonds. Without 
adding anything of importance that is new, 
he furnishes a fairly satisfactory outline of 
Symonds 's career, putting the emphasis 
mainly upon his philosophy of life, his writ- 
ings, and his literary friendships. We could 
wish for a somewhat fuller account of his 
family life, and this might have been added 
without enlarging the book unduly. Unfor- 
tunately Mr. Brooks 's criticism is vitiated and 
his whole view of Symonds 's life is biased by 
his own philosophy of violent individualism. 
This can best be illustrated by his comment 
on Cellini. "May it not also be said that, like 
all true artists, Cellini was an ideal man? 
Transgressing every moral law, he erred only 
in relation to the social background and it 
is the task of society, not of the individual, to 
provide the proper background. ' ' Society did 
not, in Mr. Brooks 's opinion, provide the 
proper background for Symonds. His real 
life was the tragedy of the artist who fails to 
express himself in art; and the chief reason 
for his alleged failure was that he had been 
put through a "grinding mill of respectable 
education " ; "he fell out of the hands of his 
father only to fall into the hands of Jowett. 
. . . All the powers that be restrained him, 
levelled him, coerced him." If his individ- 
uality had been properly encouraged by his 
education, "he might have left such a perma- 
nent book as the Opium Confessions or Amiel's 
Journal." As it is, "the conclusions of 
Symonds reduce themselves, upon analysis, to 
sanity and common sense; and it appears 
certain that nothing is more perilous to long 
life in literature than sanity and common 
sense when they are not founded upon clair- 
voyance." The fallacy of this sort of criti- 
cism is so obvious as scarcely to need pointing 
out; yet no delusions are nowadays more

popular than that the best possible education 
consists in following the slope of one's inner 
inclinations, and that the craziest individual 
vagaries have more literary value than reason 
and common sense. In justice to Mr. Brooks 
it should be added that he does not stick con- 
sistently to his theory, and that he generally 
furnishes the facts by which the reader may 
correct his judgments. Thus he complains 
that Professor Conington was "a hard man, 
who tasked Symonds unmercifully," and that 
in coming under his influence Symonds "ex- 
hibited his unhappy faculty for stumbling 
into the wrong hands. ' ' Yet on the next page 
he says: "That Conington 's influence, how- 
ever limited, was most helpful to him ... is 
proved by his later statement that while Jow- 
ett taught him to write, Conington taught him 
to see that 'literature is something by itself, 
not part of an iridescent nebula.' ' Mr. 
Brooks is willing to admit, too, that Symonds 's 
habit of hard work (gained in that "grinding 
mill of respectable education") often stood 
him in good stead; but he does not see that 
Symonds 's education, by strengthening his 
moral fibre, probably saved him from becom- 
ing the victim of ineffectual artistic velleities. 
Finally, it is to Mr. Brooks 's credit that he 
fairly describes the comparative serenity of 
Symonds 's later view of life, and the fulness 
and happiness of his last years. Symonds 's 
final attitude is perhaps best expressed in his 
translation of the prayer of Cleanthes the 
Stoic, which deserves to be better known : 
" Lead thou me, God, Law, Reason, Motion, Life ! 

All names for thee alike are vain and hollow : 
Lead me, for I will follow without strife, 

Or if I strive, still must I blindly follow." 

If the reader can allow for the author's bias, 
he will find the book a useful one. Unfortu- 
nately it is not supplied with an index.

bility of a blind and broken-down man of 
brilliant genius and extraordinary powers are 
chronicled in Mr. Alleyne Ireland's "Joseph 
Pulitzer: Reminiscences of a Secretary" 
(Kennerley). The incidents leading up to 
Mr. Ireland's entrance upon his arduous 
duties, the long and severe testing to which 
he was pitilessly subjected by the exacting in- 
valid, and the almost incredible rigors (in- 
cluding treatment that was, in its form if not 
in its spirit, nothing short of abusive and 
insulting) that he was expected to bear and 
apparently did bear with smiling amiability, 
are related with a calm frankness and cir- 
cumstantiality that captivate the reader. When 
it is added that the author was only one of 



half a dozen private secretaries simulta- 
neously stretched on the rack by the imperious 
"J. P.," as they styled him among them- 
selves, it will be seen what a surplus of 
irritability this brilliantly gifted victim of 
nervous prostration and other harrowing ail- 
ments felt himself obliged to work off on 
those about him. That his mind was still in 
such a condition as to reveal, in spurts and 
flashes, its astonishing powers of memory and 
discernment and creative force, is one of the 
many marvels of his incalculable personality. 
During a quarter-century of physical* disa- 
bility and of restless roamings in quest of 
relief from his sufferings Mr. Pulitzer retained 
his vigorous control of the great newspaper 
he had created, and his tyrannical will lit- 
erally flogged his quailing body to death. The 
book closes with the sudden and not undra- 
matic termination of the great editor's hercu- 
lean labors. Coming as the narrative does 
from one rigorously drilled by Mr. Pulitzer 
himself in that scrupulous accuracy in mi- 
nutest details which he insisted on as the prime 
essential in all his secretaries and in the edi- 
torial staff of his journal from one, too, 
who has evidently studied the clear and con- 
cise presentation of thought in literary form 
the book rather startles its readers by dis- 
playing in its very first chapter a somewhat 
conspicuous instance of inaccurate and in- 
consistent statement. On page 29, after ex- 
plaining that the bridge of the distinguished 
invalid's yacht was placed unusually far aft 
"to prevent any walking over Mr. Pulitzer's 
head when he sat in his library, which was 
situated under the spot where the bridge 
would have been in most vessels," the author 
calmly contradicts himself nine lines farther 
down* by saying that "immediately under the 
bridge was Mr. Pulitzer 's library. ..." And 
in a later chapter he, or possibly the printer, 
gives a certain famous king of Syracuse the 
name of ' ' Heiro the Second. ' ' The volume is 
supplied with portraits of Mr. Pulitzer at 
various ages and in sundry attitudes.

be sure, Mr. Yeats does not here entirely 
escape self -consciousness ; the philosophy 
veiled so lightly by old magic and folk-lore 
themes and by scenes from peasant life is 
tagged in the author's epilogue as an expres- 
sion "of one subject, the war of spiritual 
with natural order." This dualism, common 
to all mystics, might, if the poet respects his 
audience, and why write thus unless he does ?

be left to his readers to define. Hints of 
it are plentifully given on every page. Red 
Hanrahan, whose name in the title shows his 
leading part in the book, what is he but a 
personification of the author, and through 
him of the visionary race of learned Irish 
poets in general ? His quest for eternal beauty 
leads him after the Sidhe to the loss of his 
true earthly love, leads him over the world 
a homeless wanderer feared and cursed by 
the commonplace and literal, leads him 
through dreams of the terrors of limbo and 
of the joys of a shadowy heaven to a lonely 
deathbed on the moors, poor of mortal com- 
fort but illuminated by glimpses from the 
eternal realm of white-armed queens whose 
eyes "are blue as ice." It is all very exqui- 
sitely suggested, as in the line from the Vision 
spoken by an Irish Francesca in Hell, whose 
"long hair trembled about her as if it lived 
with some terrible life of its own." "It was 
but the blossom of the man and the woman 
we loved in one another, the dying beauty of 
the dust and not the everlasting beauty." Or 
again in the word of Hanrahan on the place 
of that eternity. "It is very near us that 
country is; it may be on the bare hill behind 
it is, or it may be in the heart of the wood." 
The mysticism is completely there, and the 
"natural magic" that expresses it, wherefore 

the question is a rather weary sigh over the 
ways of poets who insist on their message 
wherefore the unnecessary tag? A prosaic 
label on a fabric of cloudy sunshine and 
shadow ! 

If one were to judge from the 
definition alone which Professor 
Mackenzie gives of a Morality 
in his "The English Morality from the Point 
of View of Allegory" (Ginn), one would be 
inclined to share the general prejudice against 
this type of play. His definition is as follows : 
"A Morality is a play, allegorical in structure, 
which has for its main object the teaching of 
some lesson for the guidance of life, and in 
which the principal characters are personified 
abstractions or highly universalized types." 
From the point of view of allegory as well as 
from that of the ultimate function of these 
plays as conceived by their makers the moral 
element was all in all; but what gives the 
Morality its merit both as an independent art 
form and as a phase in the development of 
the drama is its function as a play. It was 
this element, too, which gave the play its chief 
contemporary interest. So it is that wiien one 
examines Professor Mackenzie's list of gen- 
uine Moralities, as he groups them on the basis 
of his definition, one finds that twenty-four 
represent a "conflict between Virtues and 
Vices" and are therefore of the very stuff of 



Moralities 

and 
allegories. 



drama ; that three demonstrate the evil results 
that follow from yielding to temptation or 
from making worldly wealth or advancement 
the object in life, and are thus the predeces- 
sors of tragedy in its finished form ; that two 
exhibit the crisis that comes to all who at the 
end of misspent lives must face death, and of 
these two "Everyman" makes an instant ap- 
peal to modern audiences; and, finally, that 
three deal with religious and political contro- 
versy, a favorite subject for drama at all 
times. In the course of Professor Mackenzie 's 
treatment each Morality is considered in de- 
tail, its plot outlined at some length and its 
allegorical interpretation somewhat unneces- 
sarily expounded. A chapter is devoted also 
to miracle plays that have allegorical elements 
and another to nine plays that have Morality 
features. An excellent discussion of the 
Moralities considered in relation to their orig- 
inal audience closes the volume. 



It is not strange that books fol- 
lofhavriness lowing an established literary 

tradition in one country are out 
of their element when translated not merely 
into a foreign medium but into a foreign 
mode of thought. This is notably true of 
the essay bearing the misleading title, "The 
Science of Happiness," by M. Jean Finot. 
While undoubtedly possessed of some charm 
in the original, with the inevitable loss of this 
quality in the translation the volume becomes 
little more than the rhapsodical reflections of 
one who has deliberately undertaken a theme 
and is conscientiously bound to write a book 
upon it. The work is so intently optimistic 
as to lose all perspective of the vital point 
at issue. Nor does it discuss matters in any 
more than the usual form of literary allusion 
and weak philosophic assumptions. This 
judgment may seem severe, and is justified 
only in terms of the appeal of such a volume 
to English readers. Considered in its native 
setting, it is an artificial essay without nota- 
ble message, yet wholly acceptable to ordinary 
standards of criticism. (Putnam.)

[August 16 



Three-quarters of a million Frenchmen had 
already been sacrificed within two years on 
the battlefields of Russia and Germany. Na- 
poleon proposed to sacrifice half a million 
more, thousands of them men of family. Had 
they responded to his call, it would have meant 
the decimation of a whole generation. Mr. 
Petre does not discuss the moral aspects of 
the situation, but deals with the detailed mili- 
tary operations. He errs, if at all, in fixing 
his attention so exclusively upon the move- 
ments of troops, leaving comprehensive views 
of the progress of the campaign for the con- 
cluding chapter. His work is to be commended 
for the solidity of the judgments it expresses. 
He is not inclined to ascribe, as do some of his 
predecessors, Napoleon 's victories to an almost 
supernatural foresight. He points out, for 
example, that in the case of Champaubert, 
Montmirail, and Vauchamps much was due to 
a succession of happy chances. Not until the 
first day 's fighting did Napoleon become aware 
how widely separated Bliicher's corps were. 
The author's treatment of the final movements 
of the campaign, when Napoleon threatened 
the communications of the allies, is also illu- 
minating. The volume is provided with sev- 
eral excellent maps and battle plans. 

Mr. James Ward's new book, 
"Color Decoration in Architec- 
ture ' ' ( Button ) , belongs to a type 
too common, especially among a certain class 
of English writers on art. The recipe is simple, 
the making easy : two or three half-understood 
quotations from Ruskin; reproductions of a 
number of fine things already often published, 
and of an equal number of the author's own 
designs unlikely to be republished; a few 
arbitrary and contestable dicta from the writ- 
er's experience ; a superficial historical review 
all padded out by heavy type and wide 
spacing to a hundred and thirty pages or so, 
and by thick paper to the semblance of a vol- 
ume. Ruskin 's advice against striping mould- 
ings in contrasting colors is so unambiguous 
that it is difficult to see how any man in his 
senses could make himself believe that such 
alarming results as those of Plates VI. and XI. 
are legitimate exceptions to it; or to see how 
any man quoting it with approval could per- 
petrate such things at all. The drawings by 
W. Davidson of early color decorations in sev- 
eral English parish churches, in themselves the 
best feature of the book, may perhaps be new. 
They are certainly worthy of a separate pub- 
lication with adequate discussion ; in a brief 
general book such as Mr. Ward's they have 
undue emphasis. One or two of the author's 
designs, such as the one given in Plate VIII., 
would be acceptable in such good company; 



others, especially in such numbers, serve little 
purpose but personal advertisement, or rather, 
betrayal. In the absence of anything but 
rough empirical precepts in the first part of 
the book, the careless historical notes which 
follow can furnish little but precedents for 
blind imitation they are given, it is said 
indeed, in hopes that they may prove of practi- 
cal value. It is difficult to see how. without 
artistic principles, the author can turn out 
books on art at such a rate. Perhaps, however, 
it is this very lack of principles which prevents 
him from compacting his work, and permits 
him to impose such an unnecessary burden on 
the public. 

In the "The Ministry of Art" 
ar n cMtecT tlc (Houghton), Mr. Ralph Adams 

Cram has collected a series of 
seven lectures and addresses given by him at 
intervals during the past few years. Being 
himself an architect of distinction, it is natural 
that the larger part of his generalizations 
should deal with architecture rather than the 
other arts. The prevailing note of these ut- 
terances is highly optimistic an interesting 
attitude, considering how much we hear about 
the hopelessness of modern architecture. But 
Mr. Cram sees limitless and glittering possibili- 
ties opening before every artist of this day and 
generation, ' ' a new light on the hills, a new 
word on the wind, a new joy in the heart." 
Being invited to address the Royal Institute 
of British Architects in London, in 1912, he 
chose for his subject "American University 
Architecture." This historical survey, told 
in a most engaging manner, will seem to many 
the most valuable chapter in the book, since 
it interprets definite facts in the light of. our 
civilization and atmosphere. It is striking to 
note this American voice of authority, speak- 
ing to his fellows overseas, and claiming kin- 
ship to the monks in the dim monasteries of 
the Dark Ages, thus: "Like them, we cherish 
and conserve all that was great in our greatest 
past . . . leaving to our successors the equal 
but not more honorable task of voicing in 
novel and adequate form the new civilization 
we are helping to create. ' ' The publishers in 
their choice of paper, type, and delicate tints 
in the binding have contributed to the charm 
of this pleasing volume. 



Modern Biblical scholarship has

of its traditions with those of

deep root in some quarters. But Professor

plete work extant on Babylonian religion, in

his recent book, "Hebrew and Babylonian 
Traditions" (Scribner), takes issue squarely 
with that thesis. He concedes the close rela- 
tion that exists between early Hebrew and 
Babylonian traditions, but lays down the 
thesis that these close bonds are not due to 
any late contact of the two peoples. The an- 
cestor of the Hebrews came from Babylonia 
and carried with him the traditions and beliefs 
of his forebears. Not only so, but many of 
these traditions were the common property of 
the early Semites both in Babylonia and far- 
ther west. The Babylonian records of the 
creation, of the sacred garden, of the deluge, 
are preserved in more than one form. Indeed, 
the inscriptions can be compared word for 
word with the Biblical stories. Their similar- 
ities are astonishing and establish at once an 
early relationship. But the most startling 
facts, and those upon which Professor Jastrow 
builds his book, are just those in which the 
traditions totally differ from each other. These 
differences are seen in the significant religious 
ideas of the two traditions. The Hebrew 
record has been purged of the primitive poly- 
theism that colors the Babylonian account. 
Its ethics and ideals are all of a far superior 
order, and bespeak for the Old Testament 
writers and prophets a loftier conception of 
the ruler of men and the world, and thus of 
the people whom they represented. Professor 
Jastrow has abundantly proved his thesis, and 
shown wherein the later Hebrew traditions 
are vastly superior to the other divergent de- 
velopment seen in Babylonian documents. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The edition of Macaulay's " History of En- 
gland" (Maemillan) which Professor Charles Hard- 
ing Firth has edited is the first illustrated edition. 
Three of the six volumes have now been published. 
They give evidence that the body of illustrations 
to be drawn upon for Macaulay's narrative is an 
especially rich one. Professor Firth has been able 
to secure unusually fine photographs of pictures 
from the Sutherland Collection, the National Por- 
trait Gallery, and from many private sources. A 
number are excellently reproduced in color. 

Four new volumes have just come to hand in 
the "Everyman's Library" (Button). They are 
Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell's autobiography, "Pioneer 
Work for Women," with an introduction by Mrs. 
M. G. Fawcett; Colley Cibber's "Apology for His 
Life," prefaced by the appreciation of Hazlitt; 
James A. Froude's " The Life of Benjamin Dis- 
raeli " ; and Frederic Seebohm's " The Oxford 
Reformers." All these books are worth reprinting 
for one reason and another, and the first, in par- 
ticular, is a record of courage and intelligence

AMPHORA: A COLLECTION OF 

PROSE AND VERSE CHOSEN BY THE 
EDITOR OF THE BIBELOT. 

The origin of this book which might be 
regarded as a breviary for book lovers is 
found in the fact that for over twenty years 
Mr. Mosher has issued catalogues, and 
wherever space permitted has printed in 
these poems and prose selections <~f what- 
ever seemed to him of unusual truth and 
beauty. 

Many of these selections have nothing to 
do with books merely as aids to improve- 
ment, but there is scarcely a quotation 
that does not appeal to the imagination or 
that is not suffused with Beauty as an 
everliving rose upon the rood of Time !

(From a Review in the "Minneapolis Journal ") 

Lincoln as He Was 

The Everyday Life of Abraham Lincoln. By Francis F. Browne. 
Browne & Howell Co., Publishers, Chicago. 

*TpHE material for this work, which was originally published thirty years ago, 
A was collected from more than five hundred of the friends and contemporaries 
of Lincoln. So much has been written on the subject during the last generation 
that any new issue in the field owes an apology for its existence. The manner in 
which the present volume was prepared constitutes a more than sufficient apology. 
Here an attempt has been made to present Lincoln, the man, rather than Lincoln, 
the tradition; and the result might be characterized as an anecdotal life. 

" It cannot be doubted that the traditional Lincoln, as usually presented to 
school children, and which has become fixed in the mind of the average adult, is 
a rather highly sentimentalized concept. All the tremendous and tragic circum- 
stances surrounding the man were admirably suited to act as a distorting medium. 
A long and exhausting war is conducive to popular hysteria, as a result of which 
even the most level-headed men are likely to overstate; and the tragic death would 
tend to stifle the colder, more detached criticism. Added to these circumstances 
was the powerful appeal to humanitarian idealism involved in the emancipation 
of slaves. 

" In the greater number of writings on Lincoln, one cannot but note an almost 
total lack of the sober critical faculty. All witnesses seem to have vied with 
each other in exaltation. Nearly all testimony has a suspicious note of emotional 
abandon in it. It will probably never be possible entirely to separate the tradi- 
tional from the factual; but that critical-minded historian of the future who shall 
write the fairest possible appraisal of Lincoln's character shall be obliged to make 
use of Mr. Browne's volume; and therein lies its chief value as a source. Nor 
need any American patriot fear the result of that colder criticism which is 
inevitable. The present volume, in which Lincoln is much less of a sad demi-god 
than in the conventional representations, shows how much greater a man may be 
in fact than in sentimental tradition. 

" Here is shown plainly, what has never been a secret and yet is persistently 
ignored, that Lincoln held out as long as possible against those who urged the 
abolition of slavery, issuing his proclamation only as a last desperate means of 
subduing the South. It was the master-stroke of a wise opportunist rather than 
the exalted deed of a humanitarian. And yet millions of children have been led 
to believe that the war was primarily a war against the institution of slavery, 
and that Lincoln-'s chief concern was with the freeing of slaves. Truly, he was 
opposed to slavery, but he constantly placed the preservation of the Union above 
abolition, believing that the latter should be accomplished by a slow process of 
purchase and colonization. That he thus proved his far-sightedness is apparent 
now when the negro question has become an issue of grave importance. There 
is much in the evidence here presented to indicate that, had he lived through the 
Eeconstruction period, the negro would have been dealt with in a much more prac- 
tical way than that of the high-handed ultra-humanitarians who insisted upon 
regarding the negro as an Anglo-Saxon with a black skin. 

" Furthermore, we here see Lincoln as a possible human being, capable of losing 
patience, capable of petulance and anger, capable of making mistakes. And 
inasmuch as he is made to appear more the man and less the demi-god, by so much 
he looms the bigger and is the more intelligible to men."

SERIALS VERSUS NOVELS. 



Why is it that English novels are better 
than American novels! It will readily be 
replied that the audience to which the serious 
literary artist may appeal is much larger in 
England than in the United States. But this 
reply does not take into account the fact that 
the better English novelists find at least half 
their audience in the United States. This 
was true at least as long ago as the time when 
Greorge Meredith was trying to find a public. 
He took comfort in his American readers, 
who, he said, were the first to pay him the 
tribute of buying his books in considerable 
numbers. It is true now, when novelists like 
Mr. Wells, Mr. Galsworthy, and Mr. Conrad 
have quite as many admirers on this side of 
the Atlantic as on the other. At this point 
it will be replied that audiences have nothing 
to do with the matter while individual artists 
have everything to do with it. Perhaps this 
is the reply of wisdom. But there is an eco- 
nomic consideration to be noted. 

The actual demand in the two English- 
speaking countries may be the same ; the 
method of supply is not. The United States 
is above all others the country of the maga- 
zine. It has been said, doubtless with a touch 
of exaggeration, that the United States pro- 
duces more magazines than all the other coun- 
tries of the civilized world together. Other 
countries produce books. Even Japan pub- 
lishes six or seven times as many books per 
capita as does the United States. England, 
though it is second only to the United States 
in the profusion of its periodicals, is still a 
country of book-readers. There are some- 
thing like ten times as many books published 
in England as in the United States. The re- 
sult is that novels are written in England for 
readers of books; in the United States for 
readers of magazines. 

Possibly the American temperament if 
there is such a thing is by nature devoted 
to the magazine and not to the book. Possi- 
bly the tremendous production of magazines 
in this country is an expression of the race 
which occupies it. But it seems more probable 
that an accident in the shape of the second- 
class postage rates has been the potent factor 



126 



THE DIAL,

in building up the magazine at the expense 
of the book. At any rate there is no denying 
that in the past thirty years and more the 
government regulations have been much more 
favorable to the magazine business than to the 
book business. It has apparently been more 
profitable to supply the demand for reading 
matter in the form of weekly or monthly 
periodicals than in the form of single volumes. 

It goes for nothing that hardly one in a 
dozen American novels is actually published 
serially in a magazine. The point is that not 
one in a dozen American novels is written re- 
gardless of the possibilities of serial publica- 
tion. It would be strange if many of them 
were written regardless of these very concrete 
possibilities. Serial publication offers, in addi- 
tion to the book royalties, from $500 to $5000 
to the fortunate author who secures it for his 
novel. What we say to our American novel- 
ists is this : Write the kind of novel that can 
be printed in a magazine before it is printed 
in a book, and we will pay you a bonus of, 
say, $2500. England says nothing of the 
kind. The English magazines use fewer 
serials than do ours and pay far less for those 
they do use. 

The limitations of magazine publication are 
patent enough. A magazine is dependent on 
finding a large public and finding it quickly. 
The circulation of such a weekly as the 
"Saturday Evening Post" or such a monthly 
as the "Cosmopolitan" is practically outside 
the possibilities of the circulation of novels 
when the element of time is taken into ac- 
count. And the magazines which print fic- 
tion but which have not achieved such a 
circulation as either of the two we have men- 
tioned endeavor to get just such a circulation. 
There are a few apparent exceptions; but we 
venture to say that there is not a magazine 
of high quality published in the United States 
which has not refused serial publication to a 
novel for the reason that the editor did not 
dare to print it. 

Success, even success of prestige, means 
catering to the tastes and deferring to the 
prejudices of the more conventional and the 
less appreciative minds among the hundreds 
of thousands of possible readers. It means 
appealing to the lowest common denominator. 
If in the case of one magazine the lowest com- 
mon denominator is that of the millions who 
have lacked either the natural endowment or 
the opportunity necessary to develop intelli- 



gent appreciation and in the case of another 
the lowest common denominator is that of the 
tens of thousands of "educated persons" the 
principle is the same. Cases might be cited in 
which the first condition produced a more re- 
spectable work of art than the second ! 

But this is not all. It is not only that mag- 
azine fiction must please (and especially must 
not offend) the majority. The limitations of 
the serial form are peculiarly cramping to the 
genius of the novel. If the novel is anything 
it is loose. Fine novels have been written 
which were not loose. But always the novel 
has returned to looseness. Any critically 
selected list of the dozen great novels would 
be unusual if it contained two that were writ- 
ten to a formal pattern. But no pattern ever 
chosen by an artist in fiction is as elaborate 
as that to which the serial is pressed to ad- 
just itself. No artist would ever willingly 
choose to produce one climax after another 
at brief intervals in his narrative and no 
artist would ever ask that his narrative be 
read in instalments. Finally, no artist would 
suggest that fifty thousand words be cut out 
of the middle of his novel as was done by 
an American editor in the case of one of 
Mr. Wells 's recent books. 

It may be objected that the disadvantages 
of serial publication are in process of disap- 
pearance. Some commentators in sharp 
disagreement with the rest of us have found 
a new willingness in certain magazines to deal 
frankly with sex or with the industrial ma- 
jority or with some other matter subject to 
taboo. At least one writer has developed a 
formula for writing fiction in which situa- 
tions intended to titillate are cautiously re- 
solved in a manner calculated to appease Mrs. 
Grundy. His freedom, however new or old. 
is a freedom that no artist ever wanted and 
that no artist ever took: it is a freedom 
to lie. The difficulties of serial publication are 
inherent difficulties. They may be modified 
but they can never be abrogated. 

To say, then, that America is the country 
of the serial while England is the country of 
the novel is to say that America is the home 
of Mr. Booth Tarkington and Mr. Robert W. 
Chambers and Mr. Winston Churchill while 
England is the home of Mr. Joseph Conrad 
and Mr. H. G. Wells and Mr. John Gals- 
worthy. Or is it? Is the comparison wholly 
fair? " 

If it is not fair it is because the accident 



1914] 



THE DIAL 



127 



of birth is a factor. The individual artist does 
supremely count. He does find his way in 
spite of the difficulties. We believe quite 
simply that if there is a young man of genius 
for the art of fiction in the United States 
to-day nothing but sudden death will prevent 
him from speaking to us in his own fashion 
regardless of the demands of serial publica- 
tion. But if the comparison is partly fair 
it is because novels such as some six or a dozen 
English writers have been giving us are (with 
an exception or two to be noted a generation 
from now) the product of talent rather than 
of genius, the result of honest intelligence 
and sturdy craftsmanship rather than of any 
spark of the divine fire. And to talent the 
conditions of life and of publication they are 
nearly the same thing do truly matter. A 
nation which bribes its young writers to do 
clever serials rather than sound novels is 
forced to wait long not only for that represen- 
tation of its manners which it is the novelist's 
business to furnish, but also for that imag- 
inative interpretation of its life which it is 
his privilege to make. 



PICTURES AND WORDS. 



We remember seeing not long ago in a news- 
paper a group of eight small pictures which 
admirably briefed or summarized one of the 
novels of Mr. Hall Caine. Underneath them 
was the legend "Why read novels?" It did 
seem superfluous in the face of such short- 
hand. But in books and magazines the illus- 
trations seem to be getting the upper hand 
of what is illustrated. Newspapers are be- 
coming a mass of photographs from life with 
merely a trickle of commenting text. People 
seem to go through business and games, to per- 
form heroic deeds, to get married or hanged, 
not for any interest in these things themselves, 
but simply as an excuse for posing before a 
camera. And then there are the Moving Pic- 
tures ! 

We have had many a special wonder in the 
way of inventions to overcome us in recent 
years, the telegraph, the telephone, wireless, 
the bicycle, the automobile but none of these 
is more miraculous in essence or has spread 
over the world so instantaneously as the Mov- 
ing Pictures. Events have been taught to 
record themselves, so that Time seems to merge 
into Eternity. Yesterday is abolished ! 

The Theatre, too, as it has existed from the 
beginning of the world, seems in a fair way 
to be abolished. Like a myriad-armed octopus 



the Moving Picture business seems to be grasp- 
ing the players and the playhouses in its grasp. 
To the players it offers a simultaneous exhibi- 
tion of themselves at a hundred, perhaps a 
thousand places. To the public it offers a 
cheaper entertainment than has ever been 
known before. It is curious to hear people 
in remote villages discussing the merits of Mr. 
Bosworth or Mr. Bunny, as the inhabitants of 
cities used to talk of Booth or Irving. We 
may dislike to see the drama "flicker down to 
brainless pantomime " ; we may object to have 
the theatre poet and the novelist turned into 
makers of dumb-show scenarios. But the new 
art is not on probation ; it is overwhelmingly 
triumphant. 

And as a means of education, as a substitute 
for travel, even as a subsidiary form of enter- 
tainment, it has proved its value. But we do 
not believe that the impressions it makes are 
deep or permanent. We do not believe its 
excitements will ever rival those of the great 
arts. "I go to the Moving Pictures because 
I don't have to think," said an acquaintance 
to us. The "tired business man" has dictated 
the course of the drama for a good while, and 
apparently he now has something that suits 
him. better. But an art which eliminates 
thinking and, to a great extent, sympathetic 
emotion is not likely to go far. When photog- 
raphy itself was first introduced it was gen- 
erally thought that the death-warrant of the 
artist had been signed. But photography has 
been found a brainless and soulless substitute 
for the thinking mind, the creative hnd. 

Picture writing is probably the oldest of 
the graphic arts. To represent things and 
ideas by symbols certainly antedates the rep- 
resentation of them by words. And always 
among the ignorant or undeveloped the pic- 
torial art assumes immense importance. Chil- 
dren get their first education from picture 
books. When reading was almost a hieratic 
art as among the ancient Hindus, Persians, 
and Egyptians, or among Europeans a few 
hundred years ago, pictures were almost the 
only means of impressing religious or histor- 
ical notions upon the masses. Perhaps it 
would be truer to say that only since the in- 
vention of printing has the universal reign of 
the word come in. It is only natural then that 
the people should catch at the visible repre- 
sentation of things and actions when it is 
offered them. 

The partial eclipse of words, however, is a 
serious threat to intelligence. Speech is man 's 
highest prerogative; language is his all-con- 
quering weapon. Nations trained, either by 
the spoken drama or the printed book, in the 
use of noble, significant, and delicate language, 



128

are certainly likely to be more civilized and 
powerful than if they should be content to 
get ideas flashed upon their brains by the 
means of pictures. Imagine the effect upon 
an audience of the presentation of " The 
School for Scandal" in pictures; all the wit 
and malicious phrase and delineation of hu- 
man nature left out, and nothing given but 
the dumb show of the scenes! Or "As You 
Like It" or "Macbeth" produced with all 
their poetry and infinite suggestion of lan- 
guage omitted. Then imagine this method ap- 
plied to all plays past, present, or to come, and 
surely it would breed a race of unparalleled 
stupidity. Spectacle the Moving Pictures can 
give, though certainly not with the effective- 
ness of figures and masses in the round, fixed, 
or moving in real space and distance. The 
coarser and more violent kind of action they 
can give; but violence seems almost a neces- 
sity as it is in pantomime. The exhibition of 
finer shades of feeling and thought, of matters 
interior and spiritual, must be abandoned. 
The Moving Pictures produce something like 
the same effect as witnessing the performance 
of a play in an unknown language. We re- 
member seeing Salvini in "King Lear," and, 
though of course familiar with the play, the 
lack of instant recognition of the spoken word 
made us feel that the great actor was a Jew 
peddler trying to sell Goneril a bill of goods. 
Of course our whole criticism is predicated 
on the idea that the Moving Picture shows are 
pushing the real Theatres aside, are taking 
over to themselves the entertainment and in- 
struction of the great masses. There could 
be no possible objection to them if they were 
kept in proper subordination. 

Charles Reade, who always held a brief 
for the Theatre, in one of his stories rebukes 
a young poet for imagining that certain of 
his lines have merit in themselves apart from 
the intonation and look of the actress who 
utters them. The lines " 'er my bowed head, 
though waves of sorrow roll, I still retain the 
empire of my soul" have merit and we can 
hardly imagine any elocution or gesture which 
would improve them. On the other hand, 
critics have debated whether really great 
dramas can ever be acted up to the idea which 
we form in reading them. Charles Lamb de- 
nied that "King Lear" could be adequately 
performed and deprecated the bringing of it 
upon the stage as a desecration. How much 
less satisfactory, then, must be the perfor- 
mance of any play with language, which is its 
very soul, omitted. 

One cause of the immense success of the 
Moving Pictures is their realism. The real 
pump upon the stage has always been a joy 



to mankind; how much more then must it 
thrill when it can have real locomotives going 
at real speed, real collisions, real battles, mur- 
ders, and all the incidents of moving life. 
Plato condemned poetry because the actual 
world being the mere shadow of the primal 
Ideas, the poet was working at second hand 
and giving an imitation of an imitation. But 
Plato was probably wrong. The poet, work- 
ing from the materials furnished him by 
nature, seems to reassemble them into some- 
thing that approaches the God-sprung Ideas. 
As has often been pointed out, Achilles is 
truer and more potent than Alexander, 
Hamlet than Charles V., Shakespeare's Rich- 
ard III. than the actual tyrant of England. 
Passing through the alembic of a poet's mind 
these figures have acquired a validity and uni- 
versality that they did not have in life. Nay, 
we will go farther and say that natural scenes 
rarely come up to the concentrated images of 
them presented us by the poets. Has anybody 
but Shakespeare ever seen 

"Jocund day 
Stand tiptoe on the misty mountain top "... ? 

Has anyone ever got from an actual oak wood 
such a rush of impressions, such a sense of 
multitudinous power as Keats furnishes in 
the following lines'? 

" As when upon a tranced summer night 
Those green robed senators of ancient woods, 
Tall oaks, branch charmed by the earnest stars, 
Dream, and so dream all night without a stir, 
Save from some gradual solitary gust, 
Which comes upon the silence and dies off 
As if the ebbing air had but one wave." 

Art betters nature by importing into it the 
joys and fears and passions of mankind; by 
joining together remote things in unforeseen 
similitude; by giving us at once the object 
itself and its profound meaning. And art 
works this magic more potently by the use of 
words than by any other method at its dis- 
posal. 

So far as we have got in the history of the 
world words are the most lasting, if not the 
only lasting things. Language, frailer, more 
immaterial than cobwebs, lives when every- 
thing else perishes. In the hands of men en- 
tirely great as Bulwer's Richelieu observes, 
it conquers the conquering sword. It covers 
and outreaches all the other arts. It expresses 
ideas, which music cannot do. It records ac- 
tions in time, which sculpture does not, and in 
space where stationary painting, at least, fails. 
It can give us impressions of color and call up 
sensations of taste. 

The Moving Pictures, having got rid of this 
great intermediary of language, give us real- 



1914]

ity raw from the shambles of life. Of course 
the scenarios require a certain amount of pre- 
paratory planning and the acting a modicum 
of art. In a way the business is a culmination 
of the realistic movements in literature and 
art of modern times, and it serves the inau- 
gurators of these movements right to have the 
guiding reins taken out of their hands. The 
egotism of human beings always tends to push 
idealistic and significant art aside for what is 
seemingly literal representation, and the Mov- 
ing Pictures cater to this egotism. We are 
afraid the business will have to run its course 
and will result in an indefinite postponement 
of a really great literary, dramatic, and pic- 
torial rebirth in our modern world. 

CHARLES LEONARD MOORE. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



A PROTEST AGAINST UNREASON will have 

weight only with the reasonable. Nevertheless 
it is to be hoped that even in this mad age Mr. 
Ralph Norman Angell Lane's "Arms and 
Industry" (discussed at greater length on 
another page), a worthy sequel to "The Great 
Illusion," will cause some salutary thinking. 
At the very close of his very timely book, after 
speaking of the cessation of religious wars in 
the civilized world, he adds: "So with con- 
flicts between the political groups. They arise 
from a corresponding conception of the rela- 
tion of military authority to political ends 
those ends for which governments are founded 
the protection of life and property, the pro- 
motion of well-being. When it is mutually 
realized by the parties concerned that security 
of life and property, like the security of truth, 
is not derived from military force ; that mili- 
tary force is as ineffective, as irrelevant, to the 
end of promoting prosperity as of promoting 
truth, then political wars will cease, as relig- 
ious wars have ceased, for the same reason and 
in the same way." How this change in the 
world's mental attitude, in what it agrees to 
regard as common sense, is to come about, may 
perhaps be in a rough way conjectured from 
another paragraph of the same chapter. ' ' Two 
hundred and fifty years ago an educated man, 
with a lawyer's knowledge of the rules of 
evidence, condemned an old woman to death 
for changing herself into a cow or a goat. Ask 
a ten-year-old boy of our time whether he 
thinks it likely that an old woman would or 
could change herself into a cow or a goat, and 
he will almost always promptly reply, 'Cer- 
tainly not.' . . . What enables the unlearned 
boy to decide right where the learned judge 
decided wrong? You say it is the 'instinct' of 
the boy. But the instinct of the seventeenth- 



century boy (like the learning of the seven- 
teenth-century judge) taught him the exact 
reverse. Something has happened. What is 
it ? " Obviously, as the author points out, it is 
the unconscious application of the inductive 
method of reasoning, and the general frame of 
mind consequent upon that mode of reasoning. 
It is not beyond hope that the absurdity of war 
will one day be as patent as the absurdity of 
witchcraft. ... 

TRANSLATED WRITINGS OF JOSE RIZAL, the 
Philippine patriot, hero, and martyr, as his 
compatriots are fond of calling him, and the 
gifted author of noted works in prose and verse, 
are brought to our attention in the June 
"Bulletin of the Philippine Library." Of 
these products of his pen, the best known are 
the novel, "Noli Me Tangere," translated by 
Mr. Charles Derbyshire under the title, "The 
Social Cancer," and the poem, "Mi Ultimo 
Pensamiento, " known in English as "My Last 
Thoughts." Versions of the novel and of the 
poem are numerous in other languages also. 
' ' El Filibusterismo ' ' is another popular novel 
of Rizal 's, turned into English by Mr. Derby- 
shire under the title, "The Reign of Greed." 
Other works of his procurable in our tongue 
are cited: "By Telephone," "The Monkey 
and the Tortoise: a Tagalog Tale," "The 
Philippines a Century Hence," with other 
writings by Rizal, ' ' The Indolence of the Fili- 
pino, ' ' and ' ' Elias and Salome. ' ' The Philip- 
pine Education Publishing Company of 
Manila appears to be the publisher of all or 
most of these works, though an abridged 
adaptation of the "Noli" was issued in 1901 
by McClure, Phillips & Co. under the title, 
"An Eagle Flight." Books about Rizal, pub- 
lished by the Manila house already referred 
to, are as follows : ' ' Lineage, Life, and Labors 
of Jose Rizal," by Mr. Austin Craig; "The 
Story of Jose Rizal, the Greatest Man of the 
Brown Race," a shorter memoir from the 
same pen ; and ' ' Rizal, the Filipino Patriot, ' ' 
by Mr. Craig and Miss Mary H. Fee. This last 
appeared serially in "Philippine Education," 
and may not be procurable in book form. Fur- 
ther translations from Rizal, and among them 
"The Vision of Friar Rodriguez," are con- 
templated by Mr. Craig, who is certainly doing 
his part to spread the fame of this "greatest 
man of the brown race. ' ' 



THE MARTIAL MUSE, from the time of

much stirring verse and some that is of an

excellence little short of the highest. It is too 
early to look for any considerable poetic prod- 
uct from the present European conflict, but a 
notable sonnet from Mr. Alfred Noyes's pen 
has already reached our shores by cable to the 
New York "Times." We take the liberty to 
reprint this clear-toned message from one of 
the most earnest of pacifists. 
" Thus only should it have come, if come it must, 
Not with a riot of flags, or a mob-born cry, 
But with a noble faith, a conscience high 
And pure and proud as heaven, wherein we trust. 
We who have fought for Peace have dared the 

thrust 

Of calumny for Peace and watched her die, 
Her 'scutcheons rent from sky to outraged sky 
By felon hands, and trampled into dust. 

" It is God's answer. Though for many a year 
This land forgot the faith that made her great, 
Now, as her fleets cast off the North Sea 

foam, 
Casting aside all faction and all fear, 

Thrice armed in all the majesty of her fate, 
Britain remembers, and her sword strikes 
home." 

Another sonnet born of the war and likewise 
communicated to the above-named journal 
comes from Mr. "William Watson. It is ad- 
dressed, in taunting accents, to ' ' The Troubler 
of the World, ' ' and begins : 
" At last we know you, War Lord. You that flung 
The gauntlet down, fling down the mask you 
wore." 

It ends : 

" And not by earth shall he be soon forgiven 
Who set the fire accurst that flames to-day." 
The silence of Mr. Kipling at this juncture, 
when a warlike strain from his lyre would 
naturally have been expected, is cause for 
wonder. . . 

AN INEXHAUSTIBLE SOURCE OF SINEWY EN- 
GLISH, as has been repeatedly pointed out in 
the past, and will be, we hope, repeatedly 
pointed out in the future, is the King James 
version of the Bible. In the literature that 
is nearer in time than we are to the makers 
of that version, it is a pleasure to note the 
evident influence of the biblical style upon the 
phraseology of many of the best writers. 
Opening at random Izaak Walton's "Lives," 
we chance upon the following reference to the 
unworthy spouse foisted upon Richard Hooker 
by the artful Mrs. Churchman: "Now, the 
wife provided for him was her daughter Joan, 
who brought him neither beauty nor portion ; 
and for her conditions, they were too like 
that wife's, which is by Solomon compared 
to a dripping house: so that the good man 
had no reason to rejoice in the wife of his 
youth ; but too just cause to say with the holy 
Prophet, Wo is me, that I am constrained to 



have my habitation in the tents of Kedar!" 
Why can we no longer write in this vigorous 
and at the same time picturesque fashion? 
Mr. Joseph S. Auerbach, in a recent extended 
essay on ' ' The Bible and Modern Life, ' ' pleads 
for a return to the Bible both as a book of 
religious truth and as a literary model; and 
he incidentally calls attention to Lincoln's 
well-known indebtedness to the Scriptures for 
his strong and admirably idiomatic style as a 
writer and speaker. The Gettysburg oration, 
as he remarks, is thickly sprinkled with 
"words of Bible memory" and "phrases born 
of Bible reading and Bible inspiration." 
Among them he notes the following: four- 
score, conceived, brought forth, dedicated, 
consecrated, gave their lives that that nation 
might live, hallow, resting-place, increased de- 
votion, last full measure, unfinished work, 
long endure, resolve, new birth, perish from 
the earth. Take these away, and "much of 
the solemn music has died out forever from 
this inspiring Battle Hymn of consecration to 
the Republic. " ... 

MEMENTOES OF GEORGE BORROW are desired 
for the enrichment of the museum into which 
the Borrow house at Norwich has been turned 
since the late celebration there in his honor. 
A curious contrast is presented by the two 
marked personalities that are, in the minds of 
many of us, associated most intimately with 
the shire town of Norfolk, George Borrow 
and James Martineau. And the contrast is 
heightened and made to take on a somewhat 
comical aspect by the image of young Borrow 
undergoing disciplinary treatment at the 
hands of the schoolmaster while the unwilling 
Martineau fills the office of flogging-horse, a 
disservice that the castigated one never forgot 
and never forgave. But it is not to this inci- 
dent that attention is now called. The city 
librarian of Norwich, Mr. George A. Stephen, 
asks publicity for the following: "On the 
occasion of the George Borrow celebration in 
Norwich last year, the house in which Borrow 
resided with his parents when in Norwich was 
acquired by Mr. A. M. Samuel (then lord 
mayor of Norwich) and presented by him to 
the Norwich Corporation with the view of its 
being maintained as a Borrow Museum. The 
Norwich Public Library Committee has just 
undertaken to collaborate in the development 
of the literary side of the museum, and would 
therefore gladly welcome donations or infor- 
mation respecting the whereabouts of any 
Borrow letters and manuscripts, engravings, 
or photographs of Borrow 's friends and places 
described in his works, and other items of 
Borrovian interest. ' ' Communications may be 
addressed to Mr. Stephen.

EASILY DISCOURAGED LIBRARY-USERS, who, 
after a feeble attempt to profit by the wealth 
of printed matter placed at their disposal, 
abandon the enterprise and are seen no more 
in the halls of literature, are known to every 
librarian. "These are some of my trials," 
whined the wealthy host to his guest, John 
Wesley, when the fire in the grate refused to 
burn and the smoke came out into the room. 
Some of the trials of faint-hearted book- 
borrowers in St. Louis have been inquired into 
by Dr. Bostwick, as narrated in his current 
yearly Report of the St. Louis Public Library. 
A thousand printed cards of inquiry, with 
return cards attached, were sent to as many 
addresses, asking the reason or reasons for 
failure to re-register and continue in the 
enjoyment of the library's privileges. Only 
six hundred and eleven of these cards reached 
the persons addressed, and only one hundred 
and eight elicited replies. Excuses ranged 
from the unanswerable one of death through 
the valid ones of removal from the city and 
ill health, down to the frivolous pretexts of 
"dislike of shelf arrangement," "too much 
picture-show, " and "too many steps to climb 
to enter building." It is true the fine new 
library building at St. Louis, with its impos- 
ing facade and majestic flights of steps, is 
rather formidable of approach to the aged, the 
rheumatic, and the otherwise deficient in loco- 
motive agility. Let the little wayside libraries 
and deposit stations of the rural districts be 
thankful for their easy accessibility and 
deprecate the assumption of any such Carnegie 
magnificence and stateliness as might repel 
rather than invite the true lover of books and 
reading for their own sake. 

HUMORS OF A DUCAL CORRESPONDENCE are 
faintly glimpsed in an entry that we open to 
by chance in the catalogue and price-list of 
autograph letters and manuscripts for sale by 
Messrs. Maggs Brothers, at 109 Strand, Lon- 
don. Item 1553 is a collection of letters be- 
tween members of the ducal family of Leeds, 
and among them are mentioned thirty-six mis- 
sives from Peregrine, the second Duke, to his 
wife Bridget. "All of them," we are assured, 
"are most affectionate letters . . . discussing 
the public and private affairs with which he 
was engaged and domestic matters: in several 
most pathetically acknowledging his worth- 
lessness, begging forgiveness, and promising 
better conduct in the future, which promises 
were apparently never kept, to judge from the 
several similar letters." This penitent Pere- 
grine, who never got beyond vain remorse for 
his repeated lapses from virtue, is the subject 
of certain passages in five letters from the 



injured wife "to her mother and father-in- 
law concerning the bad behaviour of her hus- 
band, the management of his estate, and her 
plans for the marriage of her son, and other 
things." All that took place two centuries 
ago, the actors have been dead and forgotten 
nearly as long, the paper on which the domes- 
tic drama is written must be yellowed with 
time, and the ink faded; but think how real 
and tear-compelling and laughter-provoking 
the various incidents of that family tragi- 
comedy must once have been. The autograph 
record of Peregrine's peccadilloes is to be had, 
let us inform the reader, for fifteen guineas. 



THE LIBRARY AS A PROMOTER OF REFORM Can 

exert a powerful influence throughout its com- 
munity. Conspicuous for its activity in this 
respect is the Newark (N. J.) Public Library, 
with its monthly "house organ," "The 
Newarker, " as its mouthpiece in advocacy of 
all kinds of civic betterment. Its recent 
espousal of the cause of the shade-tree has 
doubtless tended to the beautification of the 
city's streets and the summer comfort of its 
citizens. In Boston at the present time a 
lively campaign, instituted by the Chamber 
of Commerce, is in progress in the interest of 
safety to life and limb in the city's crowded 
thoroughfares. Doubtless the local libraries 
are doing something, through the distribution 
of reading matter, to save a few lives and pre- 
vent a few bumps and bruises and broken 
limbs while, it is to be noted with depreca- 
tion and abhorrence, all Europe seems bent on 
a programme involving the senseless slaughter 
of thousands and .the maiming of as many 
more. At Chippewa Falls (Wis.) the public 
library has lately given its aid to the outward 
purification of the city for its inner or spir- 
itual refinement it has, of course, always 
labored. A Clean City Day was celebrated, 
and patrons of the library found in the books 
they borrowed reminders of their duty in the 
form of bookmarks containing timely admoni- 
tions headed by the words, "Fly Catechism," 
or "Fly Hints," or "Ten Commandments 
Regarding Open Lots," or other similar cap- 
tions. The grand truth that no man, not even 
a librarian, liveth to himself, is impressing 
itself on our library workers in a manner un- 
dreamt-of in the past by a Magliabecchi, a 
Naude, a Panizzi, an Edwards, or even by a 
Winsor or a Spofford. 



THE BELGIANS OF CESAR'S "COMMENTA-

' ' Horum omnium f ortissimi sunt Belgae, prop- 
terea quod a cultu atque humanitate provin- 
ciae longissime absunt, minimeque ad eos mer- 
catores saepe commeant, atque ea, quae ad 
effeminandos animos pertinent, important; 
proximique sunt Germanis, qui trans Rhenum 
incolunt, quibuseumque continenter bellum 
gerunt. " And on a later page (book two, 
chapter four) we learn : ' ' Plerosque Belgas 
esse ortos ab Germanis, Rhenumque antiquitus 
transductos propter loci fertilitatem ibi con- 
sedisse, Gallosque, qui ea loca incolerent, 
expulisse, solosque esse, qui patrum nostrorum 
memoria, omni Gallia vexata, Teutones Cim- 
brosque intra fines suos ingredi prohibuerint. ' ' 
In other words, when the Teutons of that day, 
together with the Cimbrians, wished to enter 
the Belgian territory in arms, in defiance of 
international law, the sturdy Belgians with- 
held their consent and gave the said Teutons 
and Cimbrians convincing proof of their deter- 
mination not to be intimidated or overrun by 
any arrogantly assertive military power from 
beyond the Rhine. "Sicut patribus, sit Deus 
nobis ! ' ' might well be the watchword at Liege 
and Namur and Brussels and Antwerp in 
these days. . . 

SUMMER WORK OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY is 
always much diminished in volume as com- 
pared with winter's strenuous tasks. Long, 
dreamy afternoons for the reading of poetry 
and romance, the building of air-castles, the 
planning of ideal libraries for ideal communi- 
ties, and indulgence in other fascinating pas- 
times, are at this season not unknown to the 
custodian of the people's books. Other and 
more active and perhaps, in respect to visible 
results, more profitable employment of the 
time is also not unknown. At the Minneapolis 
Public Library, for instance, the librarian goes 
out and hunts for work when work fails to 
come to her. We read in the Report for last 
year: ''During the summer months the 
library was, to a large extent, a public reading 
room only. Much time was then spent by the 
librarian in visiting the homes to get the par- 
ents' signature for the children's cards. Many 
of the parents either do not understand the 
need of going to the library for such a pur- 
pose, or will not take the time or trouble to do 
so. Beginning with October, there was a 
steady increase in circulation of more and 
better books. Children, especially, got over 
the idea of just taking a book home for some- 
thing to carry, so the 'other fellow' would 
see that he or she could have a library card 
also. The length of time they keep the books 
grows longer; over half the books that are 
issued one day do not now return the next. 
They are really read, and not simply carried 



home as a novelty." Perhaps there may be 
here a seed-corn of suggestion for other 
libraries and librarians. 



A POEM 's CENTENNIAL is to be celebrated at 
Baltimore this month with an unexampled 
series of musical, memorial, oratorical, spec- 
tacular, aquatic, athletic, and other perform- 
ances, in the presence of a brilliant assemblage 
from far and near. For a week and a day 
(Sept. 6-13) the writing of "The Star- 
Spangled Banner ' ' a century ago will be com- 
memorated and appropriate tribute paid to its 
author, Francis Scott Key, though many of 
the exercises announced on the programme are 
of a nature little related to poetry of any sort, 
but of a variety that promises something 
attractive to all who may attend. Parades of 
various sorts, an abundance of oratory, un- 
veilings and dedications, historical pageant, a 
ball, a water carnival, and, finally, a "peace 
day" will fill to overflowing the week set apart 
for this memorable celebration. In the dis- 
play of objects of historical interest at the 
Peabody Galleries will be found the original 
manuscript of Key's famous verses, now the 
precious possession of Mr. Henry Walters, 
and also a copy of the broadside or hand-bill 
that first showed the verses to the public in 
print. Chief among the pilgrimages planned 
to outlying places of interest will be that to 
Frederick, birthplace and burial place of this 
patriotic son of "the land of the free and the 

home of the brave. ' ' 



WHY WOMEN DO NOT BUY MORE BOOKS IS 

psychologically explained or, at least, an 
explanation is attempted by Dr. Otto 
Weininger in his recent remarkable work, 
"Sex and Character." After proving, to his 
own satisfaction, that women have no souls 
except so far as they possess male attributes 
and hence are not genuine women, he says, in 
a chapter on male and female psychology: 
"If a woman possessed an 'ego' she would 
have the sense of property both in her own 
case and that of others. The thieving instinct, 
however, is much more developed in men than 
in women. So-called 'kleptomaniacs' (those 
who steal without necessity) are almost exclu- 
sively women. Women understand power and 
riches, but not personal property. When the 
thefts of female kleptomaniacs are discovered, 
the women defend themselves by saying that 
it appeared to them as if everything belonged 
to them. It is chiefly women who use circu- 
lating libraries, especially those who could 
quite well afford to buy quantities of books; 
but, as a matter of fact, they are not more 
strongly attracted by what they have bought 



1914]

than by what they have borrowed." Library 
workers have long noted that women borrow- 
ers far outnumber men borrowers, and they 
will now doubtless be glad to know the reason. 



THE FASCINATION OF FORBIDDEN FICTION, the 

fiction banned by the public library, is well 
known to be all but irresistible. Likewise the 
restriction placed upon novel-borrowing by 
nearly all public libraries, a restriction limit- 
ing each card-holder to one work of prose 
fiction at a time, generates a vehement desire 
for two or more, so that any removal of this 
bar would seem to threaten a speedy emptying 
of the fiction shelves, or at least the shelves of 
newer fiction, at the hands of the eager novel- 
readers. But what actually results when the 
limitation is done away with? At the Man- 
chester (N. H.) Public Library, as announced 
in its current yearly Report, the bars were let 
down a year ago, to the extent of allowing two 
novels at a time to each borrower, but instead 
of a consequent increase in the proportion of 
fiction circulated the records show a decrease ; 
which may be taken as illustrating once more 
the undesirability of what is freely offered us, 
as compared with the charm of the interdicted. 

THE ANCIENT DISPUTE AS TO THE AUTHORSHIP 

OF THE WAVERLEY NOVELS, a dispute that had 
its rise one hundred years ago, has some points 
of resemblance to the later controversy still 
feebly raging over the authorship of Shakes- 
peare's works. Like the latter, this literary 
wrangle gave occasion to the spilling of con- 
siderable ink, including printers' ink. A 
book entitled "Who Wrote the Earlier Waver- 
ley Novels?" discussed the question with all 
the zeal and much of the bias displayed by the 
Baconians of the present day in their elab- 
orate special pleadings. Its author, William 
John FitzPatrick, proved to his own satis- 
faction that Scott's relation to "Waverley," 
"Guy Mannering," "Rob Roy," "The 
Antiquary," and "The Tales of My Land- 
lord," was, at the utmost, nothing more 
intimate than that of editor or compiler. 



COMMUNICATIONS. 



MEXICO'S FIEST BOOK. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
The reference in THE DIAL of July 16 to Mex- 
ico's first book is incorrect. There has been much 
divergence of information on this subject, but the 
researches of Senor Jose Toribio Medina, author 
of " Introduccion de la Imprenta en America " 
(Santiago, Chile, 1910) and compiler of the mag- 
nificent eight-volume bibliography, " La Imprenta 
en Mexico" (Santiago, 1907-1911), may be ac- 
cepted as final. According to Senor Medina, 



Mexico's first printed book was " Doctrina Chris- 
tiana en la lengua mexicana y castellana," printed 
in the City of Mexico "en casa de Juan Crom- 
berger ano de mill y quinientos y trienta y nueve." 
The actual printer was Juan Pablos, an Italian, 
who brought the printing plant to Mexico as 
agent for Cromberger. Cromberger, a German, 
was at the time the leading printer of Seville, and 
was granted the exclusive privilege of printing in 
Mexico. Cromberger never came to Mexico. The 
denial of freedom of printing in Spanish-speaking 
America under the rule of Spain is doubtless the 
chief source of the chaotic condition of Mexican 
affairs. For three centuries the ecclesiastical cen- 
sorship was absolute. " The Inland Printer " of 
August contains a careful summary of the history 
of printing in Spanish-speaking America, based 
mainly on the published works of Senor Medina.

A POET'S PLAINT. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
The poet's vision is not always beatific: the 
ineffable sadness of our lot, as well as its unspeak- 
able joy, appeals to him. In reading again and 
not for the second or third time, either those 
too-little-known poems of the late Francis Fisher 
Browne collected in a small volume entitled " Vol- 
unteer Grain," I was struck by these lines from 
"Retrogression," unfortunately so timely at pres- 
ent: 

" Weep, Nature, for thy perverse child, 

Thy youngest, Man; whose father, Time, 
Dowered him with passions fierce and wild, 
A heritage from out the slime. 

" Where his progenitors maintained 

Existence by unceasing strife, 
And slowly through the ages strained 
Their way to higher forms of life, 

" Of which we said, our race and age 

Were the consummate flower and fruit . . . 
Now our old savage heritage 
Asserts in us the latent brute." 

To these stanzas, of so melancholy and humili- 
ating an appositeness, it may be fitting to add the 
admonitory lines with which the same poet's " Mes- 
sage from Judea " closes : 

" If wrong could ever right a wrong, 

Or life could be by death restored, 
How had the ills the centuries throng 
Been banished from Thy Earth, O Lord! 

" Oh, listen to the gentler voice 

That bids all hate and violence cease; 
And trust sad Earth may yet rejoice 
Within the blessed reign of peace."

IN DEFENCE OF AUTOGRAPH-HUNTEKS. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I have read the interesting paragraph in your 
issue of August 1 apropos of a recent sale of 
Stevenson autographs in London. Rarely have I 
had occasion to find fault with THE DIAL for 
indulging in harsh, immoderate, and ill-chosen

language. But I must now give voice to a com- 
plaint against the first two sentences of the para- 
graph in question, wherein the author is styled 
a "victim" who is "pestered" by autograph- 
hunters. Expressions so undeserved seem to indi- 
cate that the writer of them has been gullible 
enough to accept as a verity the petulant remarks 
of authors who pretend to be much annoyed by the 
so-called " autograph fiend." These outbursts, not 
always meant to be taken seriously, were very 
properly characterized by the late Adrian Hoffman 
Joline as "A Certain Affectation of the Great." 

Be it far from me to defend the autograph- 
hunter in everything he does, for his conduct is 
often reprehensible; but surely he is not wholly 
bad. Often he is intelligent, amiable, courteous, 
persuasive, and withal a pleasing flatterer. He is, 
to say the least, a benefactor to the small celebrity, 
and a not unjust penalty upon the large one. 
Many a struggling author has been made happy by 
a letter from this particular variety of " fiend " 
which showed genuine appreciation. It cheered 
him and made him feel that he was somebody after 
all, even if the critics had treated him shabbily or 
ignored him entirely. 

I am convinced that authors retain some human 
characteristics, and are far from being displeased 
by requests for their autographs. But, of course, 
it would never do to permit this lamentable weak- 
ness to become generally known ; therefore hauteur 
is feigned to keep the autograph-hunter properly 
humble. 

No, the seeker of autographs is not wholly bad. 
There are innumerable demons more to be dreaded, 
pitied, or despised, as the case may be. The auto- 
graph-hunter has his faults, Heaven knows, but he 
is an angel (although he may not always reveal 
himself) compared with those other persons who 
pursue every man and woman of sufficient promi- 
nence to attract their baleful attention. 

There is the ambitious young author who sends 
his works in manuscript with the modest re- 
quest that you read them and find him a publisher ; 
the person devoted to charity who has heard that 
you are always "kind to the poor," and proffers 
a child or two for adoption, or asks you to lift a 
mortgage and receive the blessing of him who is 
ready to perish; the young woman who has heard 
that you are rich and requests you to buy her a 
piano; the photograph-collector who honors you 
by asking for your likeness large size in six 
different positions: the genealogical fiend who is 
sure you are related to him and asks for your 
family tree ; the intrusive individual who wants to 
find out your peculiarities that he may exploit 
them in the public journals, surely the thought 
of these demons should cause the author to be 
indulgent and look with amenity upon the auto- 
graph-hunter ! 

It seems to me that a very readable article might 
be written on, the subject of " The Other Fiends," 
and I am sure that the much-abused autograph- 
collector would enjoy it hugely. He has himself 
been painted in dark colors so long that the reading 
of such a dissertation would be balm to his soul. 
Who will write the article? J OH N THOMAS LEE.

THE BANISHED BOOKS. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Will the modern architect, or more justly 

speaking, the real estate promoter, the jerry builder 

and "congestion" drive all books from the dwelling 

places of men to the buildings of Carnegie, leaving 

us only the thin pabulum of ten cent magazines 

and the daily papers which may, with no reproach 

of conscience, be piled up with the garbage pail 

and sent down each night to the janitor? 

In the nineteenth century every self -respecting 
gentleman had a " library-" just as every lady had 
her " parlor." Its books" may have filled only the 
shelves of a black walnut " seckertary " and the 
room itself may have been the resort of smokers 
or the gathering place of the family to save 
"cluttering" the parlor; but there it was, with 
sermons on " The Moral View of Railroads," 
" True Grace Distinguished from the Experiences 
of Devils," " On Female Reserve " descended 
from great-grandfather; Tupper with grand- 
mother's name on the fly leaf; Weems's life of 
Washington (presented to father at school), and 
Baxter's " Saints' Rest " (given mother in her girl- 
hood) ; rows of old school books, dog-eared and 
tattered ; " sets " of essayists, historians, poets, 
novelists. 

Mounted precariously on a chair, running a 
small, eager finger over this haphazard collection, 
a new world opened to the child of yesterday when 
" Elizabeth of Siberia " or the " Rollo Books " had 
palled. 

But look over the plans of to-day in the current 
architectural magazines dens, living rooms, sun 
rooms, reception rooms, music rooms, play rooms, 
billiard rooms, cold rooms, flower rooms, servants' 
hall, sculleries rooms for even-thing and every- 
body except books. 

And certainly no modern apartment house of 
commerce into which we move this year and out 
the next, offers resting place for the literary heri- 
tage of the family. There are no book shelves 
unless there be a cubby hole back of the mock 
fireplace or a lonely "sectional bookcase" grudg- 
ingly given its three feet of wall space, and the 
mistress implores, "Whatever you give us at 
Christmas, don't give us a book." 

A few current magazines, "best seller" from 
a " cent a day " library, lie on the table ; one can 
buy a dictionary or a cook book two inches long, 
especially designed for the cliff dwellers of our 
cities, but to hunt up a fact in an encyclopedia 
or refresh one's memory of a half -remembered 
poem means a trip to the nearest "branch" of 
Carnegie. 

And what is to become of the children with no 
half -forgotten memories to revive, with no long 
rows of queer books to rouse their curiosity, no 
" sets " to browse among ? 

Their book knowledge is of the "This book is to 
be kept one week only. Not returnable" sort ; their 
final state an incurable mental indigestion caused 
by swallowing volume after volume of " The Great- 
est Novel of the Dav " > c^Viorlnia tim/i

THE RELEVANCE OF WAR.' 



In "Arms and Industry" Mr. Norman 
Angell comes again to the defence of the prop- 
ositions first submitted to the reading public 
some five years since in ' ' The Great Illusion. ' ' 
The extensive notice and earnest discussion 
provoked by that work made it instantly 
famous and the effect it is having on public 
opinion everywhere gives good ground for the 
opinion recently expressed by a prominent 
Western educator that Mr. Angell is the father 
of a new political philosophy that is destined 
to have a profound influence in human affairs. 

Mr. Angell 's contentions are summarized 
by himself in the work at hand as follows : 

" Save only in a narrow juridical sense . . . the 
nations which form the European community are 
not sovereign, nor independent, nor entities, nor 
rival, nor advantageously predatory; nor does the 
exercise or possession of the means of physical 
coercion determine the relative advantage of each; 
nor is physical coercion within their borders the 
ultimate sanction of social organization, of law 
and justice. Military power is irrelevant to the 
promotion of the aims, moral and material, postu- 
lated in that statement of ' political principles ' 
upon which militarism rests." 

This theme is amplified in the six papers 
which make up the volume. Each paper is the 
substance of a lecture given under different 
auspices and, as might be expected, there is 
a good deal of repetition. An excellent sum- 
mary appears as an introduction. 

The first lecture, "The Need for Restate- 
ment of Certain Principles, and the Grounds 
of Inquiry," takes the position that the 
accepted theories of international polity are 
misconceptions which misrepresent the funda- 
mental principles of human association and 
cooperation and consequently produce wide- 
spread moral results, affecting society inju- 
riously in many ways. The fundamental 
misconception is that concerning the part that 
physical force plays in human affairs ; for the 
role of force has been entirely altered by the 
increasing commercial interdependence of na- 
tions and the consequent division of labor. 

The second paper, "Moral and Material 
Factors in International Relations," discusses 
the charge that "Angellism" is unmoral and 
sordid, because it is based on gross material- 
ism and national self-interest. Mr. Angell 
takes the ground that the alleged "sordid- 
ness ' ' of his views is the result of mental con- 
fusion; that the well-being of society is the 

* ARMS AND INDUSTRY. A Study of the Foundations of 
International Polity. By Norman Angell. New York: G. P. 
Putnam's Sons. 



final aim of both economics and morals ; ' ' that 
morality is not some abstraction to which the 
conduct of men, to their hurt, must conform, 
but is, on the contrary, the codification of the 
general interest ; that conduct on the part of 
the whole, which will best serve the interests 
of the whole . . . that is to say, the self- 
interest of society. ' ' Thus morality and self- 
interest are identical and not at variance. 

The "Influence of Credit upon Interna- 
tional Relations" is a consideration of the 
place of banking in the new international 
polity. The point emphasized is, not that in- 
ternational finance has made the world a 
financial unit for this has been true for 
some time but rather that international 
credit has produced a highly developed system 
of sensory nerves; and, what is more, it has 
done this recently, so that for the first time 
in history we have at hand the means of dis- 
covering the actual effect of both strife and 
cooperation as factors in international rela- 
tions. The soundness of this contention has 
been strikingly illustrated by the effect of the 
present war in Europe on the world's finance. 

The fourth lecture, "The Place of Military 
Force in Modern Statecraft," deals with the 
all-important distinction between military and 
police force. Military force is, at bottom, 
predatory; as such, it no longer serves any 
useful purpose. The only legitimate use of 
force in present-day society is to defend our- 
selves against the predatory acts of others; 
that is, to neutralize their predatory force. 
But this is precisely what is attempted by 
police force in seeking to maintain order; 
police force prevents one party from infring- 
ing the rights of another, it maintains a fair 
balance. The domestic security of peoples 
called civilized rests not at all on their having 
in the state a great military force; on the 
contrary is assured by the circumstance that 
this military force shall not be used against 
them, and by a social convention not to use 
any but police force. This is the very basis of 
civilization. 

"Two Keels to One not Enough" is the title 
given to Mr. Angell 's remarks in a debate 
before the students of the Cambridge Union 
between himself and Mr. Yerburgh, President 
of the British Navy League, on the motion 
"That the safety of the British Empire and 
its trade can only be secured by an unques- 
tioned British naval superiority maintained 
upon the basis of two keels to one of capital 
ships against the next strongest European 
Power, and the full necessary complement of 
smaller craft." The supporter of the motion 
offered the usual argument that unless En- 
gland maintained control of the sea her com- 
merce would eventually pass to other hands. 



136 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1 



Mr. Angell replied, in substance, that the Ger- 
mans had already, in spite of the unquestioned 
superiority of the British navy, gained com- 
merce at Great Britain's expense; that even 
if Germany could defeat England's navy and 
annex Canada (or any other colony), she 
would not be able to engage in any trade with 
that country that she is not free to engage in 
to-day. Chiefly, however, did Mr. Angell 
attack what he considered the fundamental 
fallacy of his opponent's positioa in discuss- 
ing a problem that involves two nations, in 
terms of one. If it was good policy for Great 
Britain to have a superior navy, it must also 
be good policy for Germany, whose people 
are no less civilized. ... So that Mr. Yer- 
burgh's solution for achieving security for 
two parties likely to quarrel was for each to 
be stronger than the other! Manifestly this 
was impossible. Accordingly the Navy League, 
instead of seeking to influence public opinion 
along these impracticable lines, should direct 
its energy and money into useful channels, 
and begin by considering international prob- 
lems as they are, as two-sided instead of one- 
sided questions. It should approach the 
Anglo- German problem as the relations of 
Canada and America have always been ap- 
proached. In the case of the latter all efforts 
were directed to cultivating amity and elim- 
inating military equipment; with the result 
that there exists a feeling of amity and mutual 
security between the states involved. The 
same condition could be achieved with Ger- 
many if men only conscientiously tried; as 
they would, if they were but taught to see the 
fundamental fallacy of the militarist's phi- 
losophy. 

It is pertinent to note that the auditors of 
the debate endorsed Mr. Angell's position by 
a vote of 203 to 187. 

The last of the lectures is entitled "Con- 
cerning the International Polity Movement." 
It makes clear in what respects "Angellism" 
departs from the " Old Pacifism." The con- 
crete illustration is as follows: Jones had 
greatly wronged Thomas and then disap- 
peared; and ever since Thomas had declared 
that he would kill Jones should he reappear. 
One day he learns that Jones has returned. 
Immediately certain of Thomas's friends ap- 
peal to him on moral and religious grounds 
not to carry out his threat; others appeal to 
his self-interest by pointing out the evil con- 
sequences to him of his proposed deed. But 
Thomas is resolved. Then comes a third party 
who points out that the man who has returned 
is not the Jones he is supposed to be, but 
another person altogether; that the original 
Jones died years ago. Obviously this argu- 
ment would be entirely effective. 



Similarly, the " Old Pacifism " attacked 
war on moral and religious grounds, or on the 
basis of the self-interest of society. The "New 
Pacifism" proclaims the irrelevance of war 
to the ends, either moral or material, for 
which states exist. This is the new interna- 
tional polity. 

Though Mr. Angell 's style is often involved, 
what he has to say is always compelling. His 
new book is not only most instructive but 
profoundly stimulating, and deserves to be 
widely read.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SCIENTIFIC 
MAN.* 



It is probable that the work of Lester Ward 
will never attain that place in the public esti- 
mation to which it is in a sense entitled. As 
Professor Ross said, he never reached the 
people, but he reached the people who reached 
the people. In the days when laissez faire 
was popular, Ward produced his "Dynamic 
Sociology"; a weighty protest against the 
current attitude, and a successful one. It was 
no small wonder that this comparatively 
young man from Illinois, who had grown up 
with no particular educational or social advan- 
tages, and had settled down to a quiet life in 
civil service at Washington, should be able to 
serve as the herald of a new era. In the 
account he gives us of the conception and 
development of his book, we see how his orig- 
inal and independent mind reacted in the 
presence of events and ideas, and evolved out 
of the turmoil a philosophy of action. To-day 
his main position is accepted as a matter of 
course, and it is difficult to appreciate his 
originality. 

At the same time, utterly unable to confine 
itself to narrow channels, Ward 's mind flowed 
in other directions, and in particular that of 
botany. He tells us that it might have been 
zoology or what not, but botany was for him 
at that time the most accessible of the natural 
sciences. So, while appearing before the 
world as the apostle of a new sociology, Ward 
was zealously collecting the flora of the Dis- 
trict of Columbia, and publishing a standard 
work on that subject. It was but a short step 
from the study of living plants to that of 
fossil ones, and here again the door of oppor- 
tunity stood open. The splendid old palaeo- 
botanist Lesquereux was coming to the end of 
his life's work, and the heavy task of dealing 
with the important materials arriving in

Washington from the government surveys 
necessarily fell to a younger man. Ward left 
the Bureau of Statistics in 1881, and joined 
the Geological Survey, when he was put to 
work on the extinct floras of the United States. 
In the course of time he produced a number 
of large works of first-class importance ; so 
that many, who knew little or nothing of his 
sociological works, thought of him only as an 
eminent palaeobotanist. Thus he came to live 
a sort of double life with two sets of friends 
and admirers. When the reviewer visited him 
in Washington some fifteen years ago, he was 
received by the botanist, w r ho smilingly turned 
into the sociologist upon request, the object of 
the visit being sociological. Although Ward 
himself thus sharply distinguished between 
his two main occupations, in another sense 
they w r ere inextricably fused. The botanical 
and geological work had everything to do with 
his basic scientific opinions, and therefor^ 
with his sociology. It is not too much to say 
that this actual contact with scientific data 
in detail and in the mass gave him a great 
advantage over those who were sociologists 
alone, without any practical acquaintance with 
the details of scientific work. Toward the end 
of his life, Lester Ward desired to gather 
together the fruits of his labors, and give to 
the public materials supplementary to his 
larger works, and valuable for the general 
interpretation of his thought. Rejecting the 
idea of an autobiography, the outward cir- 
cumstances of his life having been relatively 
uninteresting, he conceived the plan of col- 
lecting and republishing all his minor wait- 
ings. The plan, as now carried out, includes 
everything which had been printed, except 
the large works, and a single article which has 
been lost. The titles of the books are entered 
in their chronological order, and full details 
are given as to how they came to be written 
and printed. Thus, it is assumed, we are 
given materials sufficient for tracing the evolu- 
tion of Lester Ward's thought, from the time 
when he first began to express it in writing. 
There are to be twelve volumes, of which 
three have appeared. 

It is only fair to the author to state that he 
recognized the worthlessness of many of the 
earlier writings, and the ephemeral nature of 
others. He wished only to appear as he was, 
and had been, leaving the public to form its 
judgment of the whole. Whether this is fair 
to the writer or to the public, may well be an 
open question. All of the past may be sig- 
nificant for the present and the future, but 
for the practical purposes of life, most of it 
must be forgotten. We are Inclined to ask, 
what did Ward actually contribute of value 



to human knowledge and thought, and not, 
what did he succeed in getting printed? The 
first paper reprinted, written at the age of 
sixteen, is a fearful production of the dime 
novelette sort, of no conceivable value to any- 
body. Much of the other matter in the first 
volume has to do with ephemeral controver- 
sies of various kinds. Thus article 33 consists 
of an attack on the postmaster at Eufaula, 
Alabama; while article 39 is an apology for 
the same, the whole thing having been based 
on a misunderstanding. Perhaps the limit of 
unnecessary republication is reached in the 
several anonymous reviews of his own book, 
"Dynamic Sociology," which Ward con- 
tributed to the newspapers of Washington. 
What are we to think of a writer who is not 
only willing to write laudatory reviews of his 
own work, but actually republishes them 
among his contributions to thought? They 
may, in part, be regarded as useful sum- 
maries of the author's views; but how seri- 
ously can we take such statements as these? 

" That this book is destined to produce a pro- 
found impression upon the more thoughtful classes 
of society, and one that will grow with repeated 
and extended perusal, we can not doubt. That 
such a system of thought should have emanated 
from an American is a most hopeful sign. . . . 
Mr. Ward's system of philosophy will suffer 
nothing in comparison with any of the more pre- 
tentious ones that have been brought forth on the 
other side of the Atlantic, such as that of Mr. 
Herbert Spencer." 

A priori, we should say that the man who 
could puff his own literary product in this 
way must be a humbug; yet Ward doubtless 
sincerely believed what he wrote, and more- 
over it was not far from being true. In spite 
of this, the whole matter is ominous enough. 
Regarded in the most favorable light, it 
remains discreditable to American literature 
and science that such proceedings should be 
not only possible, but in some quarters, at 
least, considered natural and proper. The 
opportunities afforded by anonymous review- 
ing have been so frequently abused, that it 
would doubtless be advantageous to abandon 
it altogether. Bombastic publishers' an- 
nouncements also serve to indicate our lack 
of standards of dignity and decency, and the 
authors concerned can hardly escape all 
responsibility. 

No doubt Lester Ward's failings illustrate 
in a large measure his views concerning the 
coercive nature of the environment, and it is 
correct Wardian doctrine to condemn them, 
trying to create conditions unfavorable to 
their recurrence in others.

THE GERMAN EMPIRE.' 



A short time ago there was published in 
Germany an ambitions cooperative work bear- 
ing the title " Deutschland nnter Kaiser 
Wilhelm II." Among the various sections 
contributed by experts, one of rather special 
promise was that devoted to "Deutsche Poli- 
tik," written by the former Imperial chan- 
cellor, Prince von Billow. And, although it 
appears that the Prince's treatment of his 
subject was at all times cautious, and not in- 
frequently colorless, the sketch which he has 
written is, none the less, well worthy of a wide 
and thoughtful reading ; so that the enterprise 
which has brought it within the reach of En- 
glish readers is to be commended. 

The Ex-chancellor's book is made up of a 
series of brief subsections dealing, one by one, 
with a great variety of topics. It falls into 
two principal parts, the one relating to for- 
eign policy, the other to home affairs. Now 
and again the author takes the reader into his 
confidence and tells things which previously 
were unknown or but half suspected ; and oc- 
casional passing allusions and expressions of 
opinion, coming from a political personage of 
such experience and eminence, take on a high 
degree of interest and significance. Most of 
the time, however, as has been intimated, the 
facts stated are familiar, and the interpreta- 
tion of them is guarded and conventional. Of 
the real reasons, for example, of the Prince's 
retirement from the chancellorship under fire 
in 1909 nothing is told, at any rate nothing 
that the world did not already know. Perhaps 
it is too early to expect from Prince Billow 
frank revelations of the sort which Bismarck 
made in his memorable ' ' Gedanken und Erin- 
nerungen. ' ' 

In his discussion of German foreign policy 
the author begins by laying emphasis upon the 
inhospitable attitude assumed by the older 
Powers toward the newly created Empire of 
forty years ago, and he goes on to maintain 
that the achievements of the Empire in the 
domain of international politics are the more 
noteworthy by reason of the unusual suspi- 
cion and jealousies directed toward her by 
Great Britain, France, and Russia. The opin- 
ion is avowed that, with the exception of 
France, the surrounding nations would have 
become reconciled to Germany's new measure 
of political power, if only the process of 
growth had terminated with the founding of 
the Empire. That event, however, was not the 
end, but the beginning; and even before 
the new position in Europe was entirely se- 
cured the Empire had entered actively upon

its career as a participant in world politics. 
The consequence has been the continued ani- 
mosity of those nations which in times past 
had been accustomed to share the supervision 
of the world's larger affairs. In no small 
measure, Prince von Billow would have us be- 
lieve, the upbuilding of the German army, and 
especially the augmentation of the German 
fleet, is attributable to the international ten- 
sion caused by this unyielding and ill-con- 
cealed grudge of the older states. 

The maritime rivalry of Germany and 
Great Britain is discussed very much as any 
orthodox Navy Leaguer might be expected to 
discuss it. To the author English policy ap- 
pears perfectly natural, and even defensible. 
"The alpha and omega of English policy has 
always been the attainment and maintenance 
of English naval supremacy. To this aim all 
other considerations, friendships as well as 
enmities, have always been subordinated. It 
Avould be foolish to dismiss English policy with 
the hackneyed phrase perfide Albion. In real- 
ity this supposed treachery is nothing but a 
sound and justifiable egoism, which, together 
with other great qualities of the English peo- 
ple, other nations would do well to imitate. 

Having admitted as much, the Ex-chancellor 
goes on to maintain that Germany's interests 
as a nation compelled her to enter upon a 
course which was "bound to inconvenience 
England"; although he contends that En- 
gland should have recognized more clearly 
that the international policy of Germany has 
been defensive and not, as was the interna- 
tional policy of Spain and France, so persis- 
tently opposed by the English in earlier 
centuries, offensive. "There is absolutely no 
ground," it is asserted, "for the fear that 
with the rise of German power at sea the Ger- 
man love of battle will be awakened. Of all 
the nations of the world the Germans are the 
people that have most rarely set out to attack 
and conquer. . . . Without boastfulness or 
exaggeration, we may say that never in the 
course of history has any power, possessing 
such superior military strength as the Ger- 
mans, served the cause of peace in an equal 
measure. This fact cannot be explained by 
our well-known and undoubted love of peace. 
. . . As a matter of fact, peace has primarily 
been preserved, not because Germany herself 
did not attack other nations, but because other 
nations feared a repulse in the event of their 
attacking Germany. The strength of our 
armaments has proved to be a more effective 
guarantee of peace than any in the last tumul- 
tuous centuries." 

An Anglo-German alliance, warmly advo- 
cated in some quarters, seems to Prince von

Billow clearly outside the bounds of practica- 
bility. But, in his opinion, war between the 
two powers will never come, provided (1) Ger- 
many shall maintain a fleet which cannot be 
attacked without very grave risk to the at- 
tacking party, (2) there shall be no undue or 
unlimited indulgence in shipbuilding and 
armaments, and (3) nothing shall be allowed 
to force an irremediable breach between the 
two countries, such as would have resulted had 
the German Government acceded to the desires 
of the Anglophobe elements at the time of the 
Boer War. 

The author's view of the course of his coun- 
try's home affairs is pessimistic. He affirms 
that, -with the exception of a few bright spots, 
the history of German home policy is a record 
of political mistakes. No people, he says, has 
found it so difficult as have the Germans to 
attain solid and permanent political institu- 
tions, and his conclusion is that, despite the 
abundance of merits and great qualities with 
which the German nation is endowed, political 
talent has been denied it. It is not, he affirms, 
that the Germans lack political knowledge. In 
the study of political science they have gone 
as far as any people. It is rather that they 
lack the art of proceeding from insight to 
practical application. "Politically, as in no 
other sphere of life, there is an obvious dis- 
proportion between our knowledge of political 
things and our power. . . . For the German 
the knowledge of political things is usually a 
purely intellectual matter, which he does not 
care to connect with the actual occurrences 
of political life. ' ' The fundamental reason for 
the German's alleged inability at this point is 
found in his excessive individualism and his 
lack of a sense of the common good; which, 
in a manner, is but to reiterate the caustic 
observation of Goethe to the effect that the 
Germans are very capable individuals but 
wretchedly inefficient in the bulk. 

Speaking of political matters, the Ex-chan- 
cellor asserts boldly that, considering the 
peculiarities of the Imperial governmental 
arrangements, the parliamentary system as it 
is operated in Great Britain and France would 
not be desirable in Germany. He admits read- 
ily enough, however, that the parliamentary 
system has its advantages, the chief of which, 
in his opinion, arises from the fact that the 
great political parties are educated by expe- 
rience and sobered by responsibility in con- 
trolling, while in power, the affairs of the 
country. In Germany, and in other states not 
governed by a parliamentary majority, parties 
manifest ' ' a great deal of conviction and very 
little feeling of responsibility." Their pri- 
mary vocation becomes that of criticism, often 
to the embarrassment of those actually charged 



with the conduct of the government. The 
writer recognizes that, in Germany as else- 
where, parties are inevitable. But he pleads 
for a diminution of obstructionist and irre- 
sponsible party spirit. Without considering 
himself a party man, he confesses to a general 
sympathy with the views of the Conservatives ; 
although in its attitude in recent years upon 
the reform of the Imperial finances this party 
has been, he believes, entirely in the wrong. 
The Liberal party, he admits, has many ele- 
ments of strength and to it the country owes 
a large debt of gratitude. Both Conservatism 
and Liberalism, it is declared, are not only 
justified, but "necessary for our political 
life." 

The growth of the popular vote of the Social 
Democrats since 1890 is pronounced "a very 
serious matter"; and it is contended in per- 
fect candor that, so long as it may prove im- 
possible to detach the voters from the Socialist 
cause, it is the duty of the Government and 
of all supporters of the existing order to 
cooperate to reduce (as was so successfully 
done in 1907) the quota of Socialist deputies 
in the Reichstag. The conviction which the 
results of the elections of 1912 would seem 
utterly to belie is expressed that the result 
of such policy will be the alienation of large 
numbers of voters from a party which they 
have found to be unsuccessful. The Ex-chan- 
cellor asserts frankly that he will leave un- 
answered the question of "where the blame 
lies" for the catastrophe of 1912, when the 
number of Social Democratic seats was raised 
from forty-three to one hundred ten. But he 
reiterates that it is the duty of every German 
ministry to combat the movement "until it is 
defeated or materially changed"; and he 
argues at length that, however harmless may 
be the rapprochements of the Government and 
the Socialists in France and Italy, such devel- 
opments in Germany could be attended only 
by the gravest dangers to the security and 
order of the Empire.

to condemn and more to wonder at, for it

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1 



may be called the first English history from 
sources. For three centuries it had confirmed 
Englishmen at home and overseas in the be- 
lief that the so-called martyrs of the national 
Church were really martyrs, and that what 
they had stood for was right. There were 
nine editions in folio of Foxe's book printed 
between 1563 and 1684. Copies were in 
cathedrals and parish churches ; there was one 
at Stratford-on-Avon. 

To understand, therefore, the significance 
of the "Book of Martyrs" in modern political 
and religious thought one should be prepared 
to make a careful study not only of English 
history but also of English literature. Few 
men are prepared for such a task, and in 
selecting his title "Lollardy and the Refor- 
mation in England" one feels that the late 
Dr. Gairdner, who died before he had fin- 
ished the fourth volume, undertook to ex- 
pound the conditions that inspired Foxe's 
book. As a lifelong student and editor of 
British Government Rolls and Records he was 
better fitted than anyone else to make use of 
the mass of material first unlocked by his 
genius and industry. For however one may 
object to Dr. Gairdner 's use of terms, or to 
his sense of proportion, all must agree that 
the narrative and descriptive details so accu- 
rately recorded and to most readers so novel 
will preserve the work in spite of contro- 
versies which his treatment is bound to excite. 

To the student of history or literature these 
four sober volumes are more exciting than the 
latest novel. The reason is that Dr. Gairdner 
has given us no academic exposition; one 
might indeed contend that in spite of elab- 
orately accurate faithfulness to his sources he 
seems to have been untouched by the methods 
of historical study of such contemporaries as 
Poole, Stubbs, Maitland, and Pollock. But it 
would be idle to complain that he has failed 
to do what he had no mind to do. One can- 
not read far without perceiving that his pur- 
pose, quite baldly stated, is to offset the 
age-long influence of the "Book of Martyrs" 
and to make a kind of argument instead of 
a scientific exposition. 

In so doing the historian takes a position 
that is simply fascinating by reason of its 
difficulties. He must have a point of view 
contemporary with the events narrated. And 
this point of view must be not that of the 
forces at work which were ultimately domi- 
nant, but of those that were not. He must be 
the champion of a lost cause. Hence from 
Wyclif's day to that of "Bloody Mary" all 
English citizens opposed to Rome are here- 
tics. ' ' His use of the term he finds warranted 
by the documents. These persons were called 
heretics by the authorities, and therefore they 



were heretics. One can but wonder how long 
they continued so; perhaps no longer than 
the word is found in the records. Only a con- 
sistent ultramontanism could carry the term 
into Elizabeth's reign, however necessary it 
might seem to be with reference to Htenry 
the Eighth, to the boy Edward, and to the 
opponents of Mary. No foreign ambassador 
could make out a worse case for Henry and 
Edward than does Dr. Gairdner, nor more 
sympathetically relate the constant distresses 
of the unhappy devote Mary, dependent upon 
the Emperor and incapable of understanding 
her people. In his faithfulness to a point 
of view, Dr. Gairdner makes us feel the trag- 
edy of her situation more keenly than does 
Tennyson. But the reader can hardly fail to 
ask what was actually the orthodox point of 
view then, political as well as religious. Was 
it the Emperor's? Was it the Pope's? Was 
it that of the French King? The objection 
to the term "heretic" as applied to the fol- 
lowers of a national Church in England re- 
sides in the religious connotation of the word ; 
whereas the Lollards from Wyclif's time, in 
their doctrines of sovereignty, righteousness 
as a test of title, and nationalism, were polit- 
ical as well as religious heretics. It is not 
accidental that Wyclifite doctrines are incor- 
porated in the Thirty-nine Articles of the 
Church of England and became the law of 
the land. 

From what has been said of Dr. Gairdner 's 
point of view, and of his faithfulness to the 
records he commends Foxe for the same 
kind of trustworthiness one may not criti- 
cize his treatment of the literature of the 
time. But the critic of English and Scottish 
literature of the sixteenth century would be 
hard put to it in regarding that literature 
as ' ' heretical. ' ' He would doubtless say many 
pungent things; but the criticism would be 
so unsympathetic as to be worthless. But how 
is the history of the English Reformation 
still to be written without a profoundly sym- 
pathetic understanding of that literature? 
Government documents and diplomatic cor- 
respondence are well ; but in movements orig- 
inally "of the people, by the people, and for 
the people" a phrase said to be Wyclif's 
the literature must be reckoned with. The 
first Reformation dramatist Dr. Gairdner 
characterizes as "the notorious, foul-mouthed 
Bale." To one ignorant of Bishop Bale's ac- 
tivity such an allusion is quite misleading. It 
is far from satisfactory to dispose of the first 
historian of English literature with unpleas- 
ant epithets. One cannot imagine the Oxford 
editor of Bale's "Index," Mr. R. L. Poole, 
betraying such a prejudice. 

In 'these volumes the English Martyrs ap-

pear as a pretty disreputable lot. They were 
wrongly, when not merely foolishly, zealous 
in an unworthy cause. Such a point of view 
is impracticable ; it is too remote from that 
of other competent critics. To the inevitable 
question, why should the distinguished his- 
torian have expounded his material as he did, 
the answer may be found in social phenomena 
of Dr. Gairdner's later years rather than in 
the period of the English Reformation.

MOUNTAINEERING IN CANADA.* 



Within the last few years the varied attrac- 
tions and practically limitless possibilities of 
the Canadian Rockies have become widely 
known through such books as Wilcox's " The 
Rockies of Canada," Outram's " In the Heart 
of the Canadian Rockies," Hornaday's 
"Camp-fires in the Canadian Rockies," and 
Coleman's "The Canadian Rockies." Of the 
other great section of what is called the Ca- 
nadian Alps, the Selkirk Range, compara- 
tively little, however, has been written, and 
that little is not readily accessible. Only two 
books have hitherto been available, and of 
these Green's "Among the Selkirk Glaciers" 
is long out of print, and Wheeler's elaborate 
work, ' ' The Selkirk Range, ' ' being a Canadian 
government publication, is practically un- 
known to the general public. It is there- 
fore a matter for congratulation to those w r ho 
know something of the Selkirks that an ade- 
quate description is at last available of this 
region of magnificent peaks, glittering snow- 
fields, and deep emerald valleys. Mr. Palmer 's 
book is the result of five seasons ' mountaineer- 
ing and exploration in the Selkirks, particu- 
larly in the unknown country north of the 
main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway. 
It is a record not only of competent topo- 
graphical and scientific work, but also of travel 
and mountain-climbing in a virgin region 
combining all the most fascinating elements 
of Alpine scenery. The author has proved his 
ability both to conquer high peaks and to give 
his readers vivid impressions of the incidents 
and rewards of mountaineering. 

Probably the most interesting chapters in 
the book are those which describe the repeated 
attempts, at last crowned with success in 1912, 
to reach the summit of Mount Sir Sandford, 
the undisputed monarch of the Selkirks. The 
final climb, full of exciting incidents from 
start to finish, ended in a spectacular traverse 
along the edge of a sheer cliff, with a drop

Record of Pioneer Work among the Canadian Alps, 1908-1912.

of perhaps a mile on one side and an over- 
hanging cornice of soft snow above ready to 
break away at any moment. This dangerous 
bit of work, which came perilously near an 
unjustifiable risk, was only attempted because 
the party had reached a point where the 
goal was almost within sight, and there was 
absolutely no other way of reaching it. The 
temptation was irresistible, and it must not 
be forgotten that the climbing party was an 
exceptionally strong one, consisting of two 
experienced amateurs and two thoroughly 
competent Swiss guides. Many things are 
possible to such seasoned climbers which 
would be sheer madness to a party of novices. 

While the conquest of Sir Sandford formed 
the culmination of several seasons' work, it 
is after all only an incident, though a 
notable one, in a long and exceedingly enter- 
taining story of camping, trail-making, moun- 
tain-climbing, surveying, and scientific obser- 
vation in the heart of a primeval wilderness. 
Throughout the book one constantly comes 
upon such vivid bits of description as this 
picture of an early morning tramp across one 
of the great glaciers : 

" The stillness up among the great peaks before 
sunrise, when everything stands clasped in the firm 
grip of the frost, is impressive in the extreme. 
Each rivulet is hushed, snow is hard, and only 
rarely is a fallen rock heard. An occasional creak- 
ing of a glacier and the muffled booming of a 
torrent far down in the depths of some crevasse, 
as one passes, are nature's only sounds. In the 
chill, melancholy twilight the awful majesty of the 
mountains their inordinate bulk and eternal 
solidity is felt intensely as a deeply solemn 
chord. Not until the growing brightness, creeping 
downward from the sky, bathes with gorgeous tints 
each embattlemented crag and tender snowy crest, 
is the note of glowing beauty sounded. But then, 
in the keen inspiring freshness of the dawn, one 
seems transported to another world." 

The final paragraph of the book may very 
well be quoted as a brief summary of the five 
seasons' work, a very modest statement of 
valuable geographical and scientific work car- 
ried out under sometimes very disheartening 
conditions : 

" Supported only by such necessities as could be 
carried upon men's shoulders, we have wandered 
through the main range from the fastnesses of 
Battle valley to the remote Mount Austerity; we 
have fought our way up most of the important 
peaks that had already been climbed and have 
effected the first conquests of more than fifteen 
others, including the redoubtable Sir Sandford, 
monarch of all. The veil of primeval obscurity has

have been out of all proportion and the memory

of these days among the Selkirks will be a per- 
petual refreshment and delight." 

The book is illustrated with two new maps 
and over two hundred exceptionally rine 
photographs. In a series of appendices the 
flora, topography, glaciers, geology, and me- 
teorology of the Selkirks are dealt with in 
such detail as was not possible in the body of 
the narrative. Altogether Mr. Palmer has 
produced a most valuable and readable work 
devoted to a region that has been too little 
known or appreciated even by those who have 
spent years in the neighboring Rockies. It is 
safe to say that with such a vindication of 
their attractions as a splendid playground for 
mountaineers and lovers of Alpine scenery, 
the Selkirks will now come into their own, 
and the region about Sir Sandford will be 
as deservedly popular as Lake Louise and the 
Valley of the Ten Peaks.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



The future Recent political changes in the 
of . Orient and the new Russo- 

Chinese agreement regarding 
Mongolia bring this remote and little-known 
land into public notice and make particularly 
opportune the appearance of two works of 
travel and exploration in this land of nomads. 
The first, "With the Russians in Mongolia" 
(Lane) by Messrs. H. G. C. Perry- Ascough and 
R. B. Otter-Barry is a narrative of a rapid 
traverse in early summer of 1910 from Kalgan 
across the inhospitable Desert of Gobi via 
Urga, the capital of Mongolia, to the Trans- 
Siberian Railway near Lake Baikal. To this 
Captain Otter-Barry added an extensive tour 
through the centre of Outer Mongolia and 
across the Chuyan Alps to Biisk on the river 
Go. The work is entertaining as a revelation 
of the possibilities of travel in such remote 
regions and instructive in matters of resources 
of the land, developed and undeveloped. It is 
also illuminating in the side-lights it throws 
upon the existing commerce, long controlled 
by the Chinese, and ramifying to the remotest 
corners of this barren land of magnificent dis- 
tances by the slow agency of the caravans, of 
pack horse, yak, or camel, and less frequently 
by the crude creaking wagons whose ultimate 
goal was the Mongol market place in Peking. 
The main interest of the writers is, however, 
political, and the book is especially valuable in 
its analysis of the present political situation in 
Mongolia. Russia's efforts to build up a buffer 
state between herself and China's rapidly 
transforming millions culminated in 1913 in a 
new agreement which practically gives Russia 



the suzerainty over Mongolia. The writers are 
plainly of the opinion that civilization in Mon- 
golia will be greatly accelerated by this release 
from the yoke of China. A monthly news- 
paper and a Russian-drilled artillery corps 
are the first products, and an anti-Chinese 
commercial movement of wide proportions is 
in full swing. The two-volume work by Mr. 
Douglas Carruthers on "Unknown Mongo- 
lia" (Lippincott), with an introduction by 
the Right Honorable Earl Curzon and three 
chapters on sport by Mr. D. H. Miller, is a full 
record of a serious piece of extensive travel 
and exploration in 1910-11 along what was 
then the Russo-Chinese borderland. This 
work also is pro-Russian in point of view but 
it is full of illuminating information and com- 
ment on the impending clash of interests in 
Mongolia. The Chinese colonist as agricul- 
turist is without a peer and as trader few can 
match him in persistency and shrewdness. 
But he has not as yet brought to Mongolia 
much of modern civilization, although the 
post and telegraph have followed his footsteps 
from China. The Russian, on the other hand, 
brings a more modern agriculture, better 
transportation, and more direct connections 
with the Western world. The contest is on 
and the Mongolians are turning with welcome 
to the novelties of the Western invader. The 
author's analysis of the helplessness of Mon- 
golia in the grasp of these two great contend- 
ing political and commercial interests is both 
keen and lucid. About one-third of the male 
population is withdrawn from a productive 
share in the life of the people and is turned 
into a burdensome priesthood by the elaborate 
system of Lamaism. The teachings inculcated 
by this form of Buddhism destroy the military 
spirit while the priesthood absorbs and diverts 
those capable of intellectual and political 
leadership. The work is amply illustrated 
with unusually interesting photographs of the 
various tribes of nomads and of the barren 
upland plains, snow-clad ranges, and vanish- 
ing lakes, and amply supplied with maps 
showing in detail the new territories now for 
the first time subjected to accurate portrayal 
by compass and plane-table. 



"Stories and Poems and Other 
KernarL Uncollected Writings by Bret 

Harte, ' ' compiled by Mr. Charles 
Meeker Kozlay and published in a limited edi- 
tion (Houghton),is an attractive volume typo- 
graphically, and will form a welcome addition 
to many collectors' libraries. The prose in 
this collection is more valuable than the verse, 
and of this the early sketches and tales are 
most important. Few readers will agree, how-

ever, with the editor's remark that these show 
" the same genius which we find later in more 
finished form. ' ' The serious tales, in particu- 
lar, are of the artificial and unreal sort that 
characterized so much "polite literature" in 
the mid-century ; and some of them were actu- 
ally republished without credit in eastern 
periodicals and annuals, where the later reader 
who has chanced upon them never suspected 
that they were written by the author of ' ' The 
Outcasts of Poker Flat." The fact is that 
when Harte contributed to the "Overland 
Monthly" "The Luck of Roaring Camp" he 
began a new manner of which his earlier at- 
tempts give little promise. The selections in 
the present volume show, however, a few char- 
acteristics of the author which may help to an 
understanding of his literary career. He was 
by nature strongly satiric, and both his sub- 
jects and his cutting ironical manner were 
often liklely to be irritating. Absurd as was the 
attempt of the San Francisco press to suppress 
all reference to seismic disturbances on the 
Pacific coast, it is easy to see why his ' ' Lessons 
from the Earthquake," here reprinted, w T as 
resented by many would-be patriotic "Western- 
ers. Harte employed his gift of satire to best 
advantage in the "Condensed Novels," and 
this volume contains two or three literary bur- 
lesques. Another striking characteristic of the 
young "Western author was the breadth of his 
reading. This may in part be explained by 
the fact that Harte had newspaper connections 
in the days when newspaper men were tradi- 
tionally the representatives and the conserva- 
tors of literature in the West ; but it also indi- 
cates that he must have had tastes of his own. 
The early writings give evidence of a wide 
acquaintance with English classics, and with 
many of the myths and traditions of the older 
world. Among the miscellaneous papers, espe- 
cially those of later date, are some literary 
criticisms, mostly articles of the occasional 
sort, The editorial on the death of Dickens is 
somewhat disappointing, though the fact that 
it was written at a dash may account for its 
deficiencies. One turns to "My Favorite Nov- 
elist and His Best Book" expecting another 
discussion of the same master, and is surprised 
to find an appreciation of the "Count of 
Monte Cristo." 

A book about Japan which is 
different is "Japan's Inheri- 
tance: The Country, its People 
and their -Destiny" (Dodd) by Mr. E. Bruce 
Mitford, F. R, G. S. The greater part of the 
volume is devoted to a description, based upon 
wide personal investigation, of the physical 
features of Japan. Mr. Mitford has resided in 
that country for some eight years and he must

have been an ardent mountain climber for he 
has much to say about volcanoes, mountains, 
lakes, hot springs, and earthquakes, and no 
little modern geology is woven in with descrip- 
tive passages and mythologic lore. The con- 
cluding six or seven chapters deal with the 
people and their destiny. There are some 
shrewd observations on education and religion, 
the political fabric, and Japan as a colonial 
power. But especially suggestive are the 
chapters, "Where East Meets West," and 
"A Peer into the Future." "If the nine- 
teenth century was the opportunity of the 
West, the twentieth is for the East," he main- 
tains, and in speaking of the increasing contact 
of the races he comments upon the Western 
treaty port settlements in the Orient. "The 
foreign communities in China and Japan, as 
embodiments of Occidental civilizations, as 
microcosms of the West, might have accom- 
plished much toward bringing East and West 
together. Who will say that they have lived 
up to their opportunities? Backed by their 
respective nations and the old appeal to force, 
they indeed aroused the East; but fifty years 
of intercourse have widened, rather than 
bridged, the gulf. ' ' The treatment of Orientals 
in the West comes in for condemnation, but 
the nationality of the author is evident when 
we read that ' ' Germany and the United States 
of America are the chief offenders. ' ' Nothing 
is said about the exclusion laws of Canada, 
Australia, New Zealand, or South Africa. As 
to the future, Japan and China will be driven 
into a mutually defensive League, which will 
be no "Yellow Peril," for "aggressiveness 
the chief attribute of the West in its dealings 
with the East is utterly foreign to the Chi- 
nese character ; prudence is the keynote of the 
Japanese." And in the meantime Japan will 
be the teacher of China, for "the real revolu- 
tion that has taken place in China is the recog- 
nition of the fundamental value of material 
strength. ' ' The seventy-five illustrations from 
photographs are generally out of the ordinary 
and are well reproduced, but the maps and 
plans are less satisfactory. 

ifepmvnce. In Ladv Constance Lytton's 
of a militant "Prisons and Prisoners" 
(Doran) is presented a remark- 
ably vivid account of the pains and penalties 
visited upon those militant suffragists (though 
the writer's term is, of course, the philolog- 
ically objectionable "suffragette") who glory 
in making themselves martyrs to their cause. 
The rigors of forcible feeding are pictured by 
the pen of one who has suffered them to the 
utmost, and has four times endured imprison- 
ment as the consequence, freely courted, of 
wilful violence and destruction of property.

THE DIAL 



[ Sept. 1 



Lady Constance writes about herself, her con- 
victions, her purposes and methods, with a 
frankness and fulness that make her book 
extremely interesting from cover to cover. 
From being afflicted in earlier life with "an 
overmastering laziness and a fatalistic sub- 
mission to events as they befell, ' ' she schooled 
herself to a forcefulness and aggressiveness 
that ere long qualified her for high place 
among the more demonstrative advocates of 
votes for women. But finding her name and 
social station a bar to that rigorous treatment 
which her acts invited at the hands of the police 
and the prison authorities, she disguised and 
disfigured herself in an heroic endeavor to elim- 
inate the possibility of any favors being shown 
her by magistrates or jailers or wardresses, 
taking the nom de guerre, "Jane Warton." 
Hence the title-page of her book seems to indi- 
cate a dual authorship, announcing as it does 
that the work is written ' ' by Constance Ly tton 
and Jane "Warton, Spinster." Jane Warton, 
however, had not been many days in Walton 
Gaol (Liverpool) before her identity was sus- 
pected and she was released ere she had quite 
wrought her own destruction by fasting and 
the tortures of forcible feeding. It is probable 
that she would have been set free in any case 
before her time was up. Whether or not one 
believes in the cause she represents and the 
methods she uses for its promotion, one must 
recognize in her an heroic soul; and though 
her book is not great as literature, it speaks to 
the reader with the eloquence of unadorned 
truthfulness and vehement earnestness. Two 
portraits, a pleasing one of Lady Constance in 
her proper character, and a grotesque carica- 
ture signed by ; ' Jane Warton, ' ' accompany the 
narrative and offer, by their contrast, con- 
vincing proof of the writer's whole-souled 
devotion to "votes for women." 



Alaska 



The real Alaska of the pros- 
pector and of the native Indian 
and Esquimaux is that which is 
revealed in Dr. Hudson Stuck 's "Ten Thou- 
sand Miles in a Dog Sled" (Scribner) not 
that of the coast-wise tourist or the tenderfoot 
enthusiast. The author is the archdeacon of 
the Yukon and his duties as missionary of the 
Episcopal church afford ample opportunity 
for winter travel in the interior of Alaska and 
for contact with Arctic cold below that experi- 
enced by polar expeditions. It ensures an inti- 
mate knowledge of Alaskan forests, tundras, 
and rivers under their mantle of snow and ice, 
as well as of the hardy, energetic, ever-hopeful 
prospector, the mushroom mining camp and 
the gentle, resourceful, hospitable, unmoral 
native peoples remote from our civilization. 
The author holds a brief for the right of these 



peoples to the preservation of their racial 
integrity, their native languages, their native 
arts and crafts, and the natural resources of 
fish and fur. He is critical of the effect not 
only of the parasites that follow in the wake 
of the miner, and of our army posts and tele- 
graph officials, but also of the long distance 
management of Indian education that sets 
times and seasons for school boys without 
reference to movements of fish and game and 
turns out its scholars as literate paupers rather 
than masters of their own language and adepts 
in the homely arts which make it possible for 
them to wring a frugal living from a reluctant 
land. The Alaskan native races are doomed 
to speedy extinction unless the law forbidding 
the sale of liquor to them is enforced and pre- 
ventive medicine is applied to protect them 
from the ravages of diphtheria, measles, and 
tuberculosis. The writer is hopeful of their 
success as permanent settlers of the country, is 
skeptical as to the agricultural possibilities of 
interior Alaska and likewise of any consider- 
able extension of the reindeer industry. Chap- 
ters on Alaskan dogs and on photography in 
winter and cameras at high latitudes are of 
practical importance. The book rings true 
and the reader feels the genuineness of the 
narrative, and notes the absence of fulsome 
exploitation of personal hazard in a story 
full of exciting incident. Fine illustrations, a 
good map, and an ample index add to the use- 
fulness of the work, which bids fair to become 
a classic of mid-Avinter travel in the far north. 



The noisome 
fly. 



A late volume in the recently 
established "Cambridge Public 
Health Series" is by Dr. G. S. 
Graham-Smith on "Flies in Relation to Dis- 
ease: Non-bloodsucking Flies" (Cambridge 
University Press). Popular interest in the 
suppression and elimination of the plague of 
flies from city and country life is on the in- 
crease and "swat the fly" campaigns have 
been in progress in many enterprising com- 
munities. This book gives reliable infor- 
mation on the appearance, structure, life-his- 
tory, and breeding habits of the common flies 
which occur in our cities and towns. It also 
gives the evidence of the agency of flies in 
spreading the bacteria which cause typhoid 
fever and other intestinal diseases, such as 
tuberculosis and diphtheria, and in distribut- 
ing certain non-bacterial diseases, and gives at 
length the methods by which the plague of 
flies may be prevented or controlled. There is 
a deal of caution in the matter and manner of 
the book so that the reader is left with the 
feeling that much is yet to be learned regard- 
ing the actual extent to which flies are to be 



1914] 



THE DIAI, 



145 



credited with the spread of disease. Enough 
is surely known to justify all efforts to destroy 
the fly which are being made. But the caution 
is wise. It is well to remember that the phrase 
"typhoid fly" may tend to obscure the fact 
in the popular mind, that the fly is but one of 
many agencies in the spread of typhoid germs. 
The careful summaries of evidence regarding 
the agency of the fly in spreading different 
diseases in question and the conservative 
temper of the author will serve not only as 
ammunition for scientific attacks upon the 
problem of fly control and for stimulus to 
further bacteriological and epidemiological 
research, but also, it is to be hoped, as a mild 
corrective for those enthusiasts on this matter 
whose zeal exceeds their knowledge and puts 
their critical faculty under angesthesia. A 
very complete bibliography of nearly three 
hundred titles dealing with the biology of flies 
and their relations to disease is appended. 
Though written for the medical and biological 
reader the work is not so technical but that the 
general reader will find it replete with facts 
clearly stated and discussions of problems of 
great sanitary and social interest. 



A study 

of Henry V. 



The mention of King Henry V. 
of England always brings up 
memories of his victorious career 
in France, and especially of the crushing 
defeat that he administered to the astonished 
French at Agincourt in 1415. But the impor- 
tance of Henry's reign is not to be measured 
by his doubtful military successes across the 
Channel ; his domestic policies were in some 
respects as far-reaching as his imperialistic 
ambitions. Mr. James Hamilton Wylie has 
undertaken a detailed study of this interesting 
period, "The Reign of Henry V." (Button), 
the first volume of which has recently 
appeared. It covers the first two years of the 
reign and the contents make a solid volume of 
nearly six hundred pages. We are not 
informed how many volumes are to follow; 
but if the author maintains the scale and 
proportion of the first, it will require at least 
three or four to complete the series. Mr. 
Wylie has gathered together an immense 
amount of information, all of which he appears 
to have utilized either in the text or in his 
several thousand footnotes, which comprise at 
least two-thirds of the entire work. He deals 
with a great variety of facts and discusses 
almost every imaginable phase of the reign: 
Continental diplomacy, British affairs, the 
civil strife in France, the Lollard movement, 
the English church, hospitals, almshouses, 
religious foundations, and the material neces- 
sities of warfare are some of the larger topics 



that Mr. Wylie has treated. The volume con- 
tains an extended and illuminating account of 
the efforts made, especially by the French, to 
prevent the outbreak of war, and the treacher- 
ous diplomacy of the English king is shown 
in its true light. Mr. Wylie has also made a 
detailed study of Henry's preparations" for 
the invasion of France ; of particular interest 
is his account of how the venture was financed. 
Students of English history will find Mr. 
Wylie 's work a mine of interesting and valu- 
able information; but the general reader is 
not likely to be attracted to a work in which 
the general course of events is lost sight of in 
a maze of rather minute details. 



A study 
of naval 
efficiency. 



The amateur possesses a certain 
advantage over the professional 
^^ in presenting for popular peru- 

sal almost any subject of something more than 
technical interest. He understands the lay- 
man's point of view, knows what aspects of 
the theme will especially appeal to him, and 
instinctively avoids a bewildering superfluity 
of scientific or technical terms. Mr. Robert W. 
Neeser, author of that popular presentation of 
naval activities, ' ' A Landsman 's Log, ' ' follows 
it up with a rather more detailed and formal 
account of our bluejackets' duties and daily 
drill, in a handsomely printed and illustrated 
octavo entitled " Our Many-sided Navy " 
(Yale University Press). He gives us a series 
of well-written and agreeably-instructive chap- 
ters on the fleet at sea, the naval station at 
Guantanamo Bay, the organization of the ship, 
the daily life on shipboard, the battleship as 
an educational institution, the engineering 
competitions, athletics in the navy, the sailor 
as a soldier, the torpedo flotillas, gunnery 
training, and target practice, with four 
appended papers on the navy's services in 
times of peace, the organization and distribu- 
tion of the navy at the date of writing, the 
individual ship's organization, and the weekly 
routine on shipboard. If any landsman wishes 
to know the variety and profundity of his own 
ignorance in naval matters, and to correct a 
probable sufficiency of misconceptions, let him 
read Mr. Neeser 's book, which is calculated to 
make all its readers feel that if we must be 
burdened with a big navy, or what would once 
have been accounted such, it is some consola- 
tion to be assured of its admirable efficiency 
and its constant readiness for emergencies.

the Circumlocution Office and joins in the out- 
cry against the absurd technicalities of the 
courts ; if compelled to go into the fray to pro- 
tect his interests he retains a lawyer and col- 
lects a war fund to meet the inevitable costs of 
litigation. In "A History of Continental 
Criminal Procedure ' ' (Little, Brown & Co.) , by 
Professor A. Esmein, we have a learned ac- 
count of the evolution of modern criminal pro- 
cedure in all countries; for the American 
editors have introduced extracts from other 
authorities to fill the gaps left by the Frenfch- 
man. Many a puzzle is cleared up, many a mys- 
tery is solved by this historical method. To meet 
a complex social situation by a primitive simple 
method would not answer to the requirements. 
Some absurdities remain to be corrected. The 
conservatism of lawyers is vividly illustrated. 
An argument in favor of the jury system, bor- 
rowed from England and never quite at home 
in France, is worth study by Americans. The 
subject of public reparation to citizens 
unjustly punished deserves more considera- 
tion than it has yet received in any country. 
To the lawyer and to the student of crimin- 
ology this work is indispensable. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



"The China Year Book, 1914" (Button) has 
been compiled by Mr. H. G. W. Woodhead, editor 
of the " Peking Gazette," and Mr. H. T. Montague 
Bell, formerly editor of the "North-China Daily 
News." Its information is surprisingly recent. 

A very useful volume and one which is far 
superior to many of its kind is " Siam : A Hand- 
book of Practical, Commercial, and Political Infor- 
mation " (Browne & Howell Co.), by Mr. W. A. 
Graham, of which a second edition has recently 
appeared. A list of the principal topics treated in- 
dicates the scope of the work: geography, science, 
races, history, social organization, education, gov- 
ernment, industries, commerce, trade and treaties, 
communications and transport, art, archaeology, 
architecture, music, dancing and the drama, relig- 
ion, language and literature, and bibliography. 

The instructors in Latin in Williams College 
have published a " Selection of Latin Verse " (Yale 
University Press). The volume contains one hun- 
dred and twenty-six pages of text, entirely with- 
out notes, and is intended to meet the needs of 
Williams freshmen. Brief explanatory notes are 
to follow later. It seems to us that for the small 
amount of text given the price is needlessly high. 
Various selections of the kind might well be pre- 
pared for sight reading in college classes, but the 
condition of the average college student's pocket- 
book should be considered. The bulk of the 
Williams volume is comprised within the time limits 
of Lucretius and Juvenal, with a handful of selec- 
tions running down to Thomas of Celano and the 
Dies Irae, in the thirteenth century. 



NOTES. 



A complete collection of the poems of Mr. 
Edward Sandford Martin will be brought out 
shortly by Messrs. Scribner. 

Miss Helen Marshall Pratt's " Westminster

Bernard Shaw " by Mr. Joseph McCabe. 

The career of Lord Charles Beresford, who re- 
tired as admiral of the British navy in 1911 and is 
now among the last of the great Victorian seamen, 
is set forth in an autobiographical account of his 
life, edited by Mr. L. Cope Cornford. Messrs. 
Little, Brown & Co. will issue it in two large illus- 
trated volumes. 

The third volume in the series of social studies 
which the Century Co. is publishing for the Bureau 
of Social Hygiene is in preparation. It is the 
work of Mr. Raymond B. Fosdick, and will present, 
under the title of " European Police Systems," his 
investigations of the police departments of twenty- 
two European cities. 

A useful list of books illustrating or discussing 
"American Local Dialects " is issued by the St. 
Louis Public Library. Fiction, including many 
novels having comparatively little dialect, is largely 
represented. The classification is chiefly geograph- 
ical, there are good annotations, in brief compass, 
and a concluding author index. 

Mr. Lawrence J. Burpee, whose " Pathfinders of 
the Great Plains," dealing with the explorations of 
La Verendrye and his sons, has just been pub- 
lished by Messrs. Glasgow, Brook & Co. of Toronto, 
will issue shortly through the John Lane Co. a 
volume of description and travel in the Canadian 
Rockies and Selkirks, under the title "Among the 
Canadian Alps." 

" The Changing Drama : Its Contributions and 
Tendencies," by Professor Archibald Henderson, is 
to be published next month by Messrs. Henry Holt 
& Co. Based largely on a study of the drama in 
the theatres of Great Britain and the Continent, it 
aims to give a general survey of the subject and to 
treat in more detailed manner some of its chief 
creative contributions. 

What promises to be one of the most notable 
biographies of the season is announced by Messrs. 
Houghton Mifflin Co. in "The Life of S. F. B. 
Morse," prepared from letters and journals by his 
son, Mr. Edward L. Morse. The first volume will 
contain an account of the inventor's early training 
and deal with the interesting though little known 
period of his life when he set out on a career of 
distinction as a portrait painter. In the second 
volume Mr. Morse presents in detail the story of 
his father's important invention of the electric tele- 
graph, the difficulty in establishing his rights as 
the inventor, and the rewards that were finally his. 

Literature's loss in the death of Jules Lemaitre 
will be accounted the greater because of his com- 
parative youth if the young people will allow 
the word he being only in his sixty-second year 
when the pen dropped from his hand last month. 
He was born at Vennecy, near Orleans, Aug. 27, 
1853, finished his education at the Lycee Charle- 
magne and the Ecole Normale Superieure, then 
taught literature at Havre, Algiers, Besancon, and 
Grenoble, but in 1884 turned from teaching to the 
more congenial employment of writing, in which he 
had already met with some success. He succeeded 



J. J. Weiss as dramatic critic of the " Journal des 
Debats," and afterward filled the same office for 
the "Revue des Deux Mondes." He wrote also 
for the " Revue Bleue," and was conspicuously 
successful with his series of critical essays on mod- 
ern authors, a series subsequently issued in seven 
volumes under the general title, "Les Contem- 
porains." His dramatic criticisms were likewise 
republished, in ten volumes, with the title, "Im- 
pressions de Theatre." Amid these activities he 
found time to issue two volumes of poetry and 
several books of fiction, as well as a number of 
plays and some political writings. But his literary 
and dramatic criticism constitutes his best work, in 
which he showed himself an original and charming 
and at times a brilliant writer of the impressionist 
school of criticism. The French Academy admitted 
him to membership in 1896, and few have been the 
Academicians who, first and last, have better de- 
served the honor.

out Bismarck's policies under the present Emperor during the time in which Germany was welded together 
from a collection of small kingdoms into a great nation. In this volume the man who was at the very 
center of the empire's diplomacy, the man whose far-seeing mind and wonderful executive ability had a 
very great share in the making of modern Germany, reveals the plans and problems of this stupendous 
undertaking. Germany's colonial extension, the growth of her sea-power, her internal problems, and her 
foreign policy, are a few of the matters of vital importance discussed frankly and openly by Prince von 
Biilow. Price, $3.00 net. 

An Authoritative and Most Illuminating Presentation of the German Autocracy's 

Point of View 

WAR! By W. Douglas Newton. With an introduction by 
Rudyard Kipling. 

This book has been written in a story form with the purpose of showing what war is in its stark, bitter, 
ugly reality. It describes the progress of an invading army, and tells, with the cold accuracy of a camera, 
the results to the people attacked. The ugly, naked details of the battlefield, the bloody slaughter of 
modern scientific warfare, the desperate suffering of the conquered rjeople, are related with a vigor and 
realism that leave little to the imagination of the reader. As a basis for the newspaper reading on the 
present situation, this book gives a thorough and vivid comprehension of the significance of the struggle 
to the human beings involved in it. Price, $1.20 net. 

THE WHIRLPOOL OF EUROPE : Austria-Hungary and the 
Hapsburgs. By Archibald R. and E. M. Golquhoun. 

The political and social life of the dual monarchy are described from intimate personal acquaintance. 
The empire's racial differences, its peculiar political relations to neighboring powers, and in particular its 
relation to the Balkan States, are thoroughly analyzed. With illustrations and maps. Price, $3.50 net. 

THE EMPRESS FREDERICK. Anonymous. 

The first biography of the mother of the present German Kaiser to appear in English. William II. 
has always been called much more the son of his mother than of his father, and to understand his character 
a knowledge of the Empress Frederick is essential. She was the eldest daughter of Queen Victoria, a 
central figure at Berlin for many years, and the implacable enemy of Bismarck. Illustrated.

THE FRENCH AND THE ENGLISH. By Laurence Jerrold. 

The author is the Paris correspondent of a great London newspaper which gives particular attention 
to social and continental life and character. He contrasts, with a vivid but kindly vigor, the French and 
English temperaments, the conditions of life in Paris and London, and the whole existence of the two 
peoples, day by day. A critical and at the same time a thoroughly entertaining study. Price, $2.50 net. 

HELLAS AND THE BALKAN WARS. By D. J. Cassavetti. 

The author is a Greek, who received his degree at Oxford. He was at the front with the Greek forces 
in the recent Balkan wars, and has now written a clear, graphic account of the status of Greece before the 
struggle commenced, the battles in which her armies were engaged, her present condition, and her outlook 
for development. With illustrations and maps. Price, $3.00 net. 

JAPAN'S INHERITANCE. The Country, Its People, and Their 
Destiny. By E. Bruce Mitford, F. R. G. S. 

"Wanted the truth about Japan!" says the author in his preface, and in this book the author 
brings the results of ten years' residence in Japan and the habits of keen observation of the trained scientist. 
A significant book on the trend of Modern Japan. With illustrations and maps. Price, $3.00 net.

This is the diary kept by Mrs. 
Stevenson of the cruise which she took 
with her husband, Robert Louis Steven-

Mrs. Stevenson has eliminated from

BY KENYON Cox 

There is no one writing of art to-day 
with the vitality that fills every para-

from what has become almost a con- 
ventional jargon in much art criticism, 
and the essential interest of every com- 
ment and suggestion, account for an 
altogether exceptional success that his 
book on The Classic Spirit has had 
within the last few years, and that will 
be repeated with this volume.

AUTHOR _^__^_^_^ 



Cynthia Stockley. Author of " Poppy." " The Claw," " Wan- 
derfoot," etc. Not the regulation collection of short 
stories, but a series of pictures and events making one big 
story of the spirit of South Africa that will be eagerly 
sought by readers of the vivid interpreter of that romantic 
country. 

Francis William Sullivan. A story of intense love, noble self- 
sacrifice and terrific struggle, with a rugged background of 
the Northwest lumber woods, the busy logging camps and 
the thrilling river drives. A red-blooded story as whole- 
some as its setting. 

James Elroy Flecker. All Romance a tale of madmen, 
kings, scholars, grocers, consuls and Jews. Plenty of love 
and absurdity a very old sort of tale, as joyously im- 
probable as life itself. 

S. G. Tallentyre. Author of " Bassett," "Life of Voltaire," 
" Mirabeau," etc. A fine bit of character drawing. A very 
human document for people of discernment. 

K. F. Purdon. Introduction by George A. Birmingham. An 
Irish story about Irish people, told only as an Irishman 
can tell. Much hilarity and no little pathos. 

Rachel S. Macnamara. Author of " The Fringe of the Des- 
ert." In this new novel by an author justly famed for her 
wonderful descriptions of the East, the reader is brought 
into close personal touch with Venice. 

Pompeo, Duke Litta. Author of " The Soul of a Priest," etc. 
A novel of particular interest to lovers of Italy. It gives 
also a very telling picture of economic conditions between 
the peasantry and landowners at the present time. 

Ethel M. Dell. Author of "The Way of an Eagle," "The 
Knave of Diamonds," " The Rocks of Valpre," etc. These 
stories justify a well-known London reviewer who said, 
" Miss Dell is the most likely successor at the goal of enor- 
mous popularity reached by Marie Corelli." 

F. W. Bain. Author of "A Digit of the Moon," "A Draught 
of the Blue," etc. " No words I can write can fittingly 
express the fascination of Mr. Bain's books," writes E. V. 
Lucas in the London Bookman. This is another series of 
his tender, wistful and elemental tales of the East. 

G. de H. Vaizey. Author of "An Unknown Lover," etc. A 
story touching the fundamentals of life understandingly 
and wholesomely. Grizel Beverley, familiar to readers of 
" An Unknown Lover," again appears. 

Andre Lafon. " Jean Gilles, Schoolboy " has won the highest 
recompense in the gift of the Academic Francaise, the prize 
of $2,000 offered for " imaginative work of an elevated 
character." 

Morley Roberts. Author of "The Private Life of Henry 
Maitland." Unlike any other novel in the English lan- 
guage. Preaches the gospel of tolerance and human kind- 
ness, but will hardly be accepted by those worthy people 
whose lives are governed by conventions. 

Florence L. Barclay. Author of "The Rosary," "The Fol- 
lowing of the Star," " The Broken Halo," etc. A new long 
novel by the most popular living author. Wrapper in full 
color. Colored frontispiece. About 450 pages.

and concisely the fine points of the present game of 
Nullo-Auction. 

MY PATH THROUGH LIFE. By Lilli Lehmann. 8.

OUTDOOR SCENES 
AND THOUGHTS 

FROM THE 

WRITINGS OF 

WALT WHITMAN 

COMPILED BY 
WALDO R. BROWNE 

WITH INTRODUCTION BY 
JOHN BURROUGHS 

Photogravure Portrait, $1.00 net 



WHITMAN'S writing of nature, whether in 
poetry or prose, is always marked by vividness and 
actuality : in verse by a lyrical passion and in prose by a 
luxuriance of observation that are unique. This collection 
of out-of-door passages from his writings will appeal strongly, 
not only to all admirers of his poetry, but to all lovers of the 
open. It is an ideal book for the pocket on a country walk, 
and an equally ideal gift for the nature-lover. 



"The unconventional character of Whitman's writing is seen at its 
best in these rapturous and sometimes almost riotous outpourings of 
satisfaction in the joy of living out of doors." The Living Age. 

" An altogether discriminating anthology Whitman poet and 

Whitman diarist are both most happily represented. ' ' The Independent. 

" A welcome little outdoor book, fit for the pocket. . . . The selec- 
tions are from the journals and poems, and show Whitman keenly 
observant of and exultant in his surroundings." The Nation. 

"For him who loves Whitman and frequent reference to him at his 
best, yet wishes a pocketable volume, ' The Rolling Earth ' is ideal."

LIST OF NEW BOOKS . . 227 



BOOKS OF THE COMING SEASON. 



There is usually nothing more exciting to 
read at this season of the year than the pub- 
lishers' announcements. Every goose is so 
much a swan before the autumn flight of books 
has actually begun that even those descrip- 
tions which are supplied by the young men 
whose business it is to write enthusiastically 
of every book their employers publish seem 
credible. The disappointments of other sea- 
sons, the books that promised so well in the 
advance notices and turned out so badly in 
the reading, are forgotten. The desire that 
the new books worth reading (and keeping) 
will be many is too keen to admit the proba- 
bility that they will be few. It seems that 
there never were so many interesting things 
coming. And though this year the war in 
Europe gives a certain advantage over pub- 
lishers' announcements to the front pages of 
the newspapers, it is an advantage easily over- 
estimated. Not that the publishers have over- 
estimated the interestingness of the war news. 
Despite their concern as to the effect of the 
war upon the book trade they have gone 
ahead to announce as many books this year as 
they did last year, or more. A few impor- 
tations have been postponed or withdrawn, 
but they will rapidly be replaced by books 
on the war and its causes. Professor Hugo 
Munsterberg is even now, we are informed, 
dictating many pages a day of a book con- 
ceived since August 1 on "The War and 
America." That there will be many others 
goes without saying. 

These books will belong, in so far as they 
discuss contemporary social forces, quite as 
much to economics or sociology as to history : 
they might be lumped off inclusively under 
the heading of "social criticism." That is a 
heading which cuts across the formally classi- 
fied list of fall books which we publish in 
another part of this issue of THE DIAL, but 
one which does describe a kind of book which 
has greatly increased of late years. Indeed, 
some of the most valuable and stimulating 
books written in English during the last ten 
or a dozen years would come under this head- 



184 



THE DIAI, 



[Sept, 16 



ing. Professor Thorstein Veblen 's " A Theory 
of the Leisure Class" and Mrs. Olive 
Schreiner's "Woman and Labor" are capital 
examples. There is perhaps no book to be 
published this season Avhich promises to equal 
either of those two. We do not find here (or 
anywhere else) a title that stands out as the 
book of the year. But there are a number of 
titles that promise well. One of these is Mr. 
Herbert Croly's "Progressive Democracy" 
and another is Mr. Walter Lippmann 's ' ' Drift 
and Mastery : An Attempt to Diagnose the 
Current Unrest." Professor Edward Als- 
worth Ross, who has contributed many a 
piquant phrase to current social criticism, is 
the author of "The Old World in the New," 
a study of the different races of Europe in 
the United States which has been appearing 
serially in the "Century." Mr. Frederic C. 
Howe 's new book is to be called ' ' The Ameri- 
can City." Of a different order, though 
doubtless written for the sake of the applica- 
tions to present society which their researches 
have enabled them to make, are Mr. and Mrs. 
Walter M. Gallichan's new books. Mr. Gal- 
lichan writes on "Women under Polygamy" 
and Mrs. Gallichan on "The Age of the 
Mother Power." We have some doubt as to 
whether this age ever existed, but we shall be 
interested to hear about it just the same. 
Miss Ellen Key is to be represented this sea- 
son by "The Younger Generation" and Mr. 
Havelock Ellis by "Impressions and Com- 
ments." Two French books from opposite 
camps are M. Georges Sorel's "Reflections on 
Violence" and M. Emile Faguet's "The 
Dread of Responsibility." M. Faguet is a 
defender of aristocracy; M. Sorel of syn- 
dicalism. 

The fashion of "human documents" is 
allied to the fashion of social criticism. Our 
contemporary curiosity about life, so fresh 
and so wide, takes the form of personal con- 
fessions in the popular magazines and of 
courses in sociology in the universities. Some 
human documents take the form of biog- 
raphies, as does Miss Marie Sukloff's "The 
Life Story of a Russian Exile," and some are 
anonymous novels, as is but we refrain 
from calling special attention to any anony- 
mous confession until we have seen it. 

Of novels which we do not hesitate to men- 
tion there are a number. Mr. Wells 's new 
one, "The Wife of Sir Isaac Harman." will 
hardly be ready before Thanksgiving, owing 



to the war, but it will probably be worth wait- 
ing for. Mr. Compton Mackenzie, who last 
year gave us "Youth's Encounter," has com- 
pleted the story there begun under the title of 
"Sinister Street." Other novelists who have 
promised sequels or the completion of trilogies 
have been dilatory. Mr. J. D. Beresford is an 
exception. The third volume of his Jacob 
Stahl trilogy will not be published until next 
spring, but it is ready for the printer. In 
the meantime he has written "The House in 
Demetrius Road." Miss Ethel Sidgwick. who 
lias written two immensely clever volumes of 
the history of Antoine in "Promise" and 
"Succession," has turned aside this season to 
write "A Lady of Leisure." Mr. Arnold 
Bennett has not finished the story of Hilda 
Lessways and Edwin Clayhanger. Mr. Martin 
Andersen Nexo's four -volume novel, "Pelle 
the Conqueror," is complete in its Danish 
original, and the English translation of the 
second volume will be ready in a month or 
two. If it is as good as the first volume it 
will be as well worth reading as any novel 
likely to be published between now and Christ- 
mas. But all the novelists are not writing 
trilogies and all the promising ones are not 
on the other side of the Atlantic. Mr. 
Coningsby Dawson, who made such a hit last 
year with ' ' The Garden without Walls, ' ' is in 
England, but only until the war is over. His 
new novel is called ' ' The Raft. ' ' Mr. Samuel 
Hopkins Adams has written a novel about an 
American newspaper, "The Clarion," which 
may be the newspaper novel we have long 
expected and have never seen. A new Ameri- 
can novelist who may be worth while is Mr. 
Edward C. Venable, the author of "Pierre 
Vinton: The Adventures of a Superfluous 
Husband. ' ' Of novels by popular, or familiar. 
American writers there is no end. That some- 
where in the list there will be a genuine piece 
of artistry is too much to believe but not too 
much to hope. 

It seemed for a time as if the drama might 
dispute the novel's popularity. The list of 
books about the theatre grew astoundingly 
and publishers began actually to print plays 
for readers. If the drama has not really 
challenged the novel it is perhaps because it 
has been so much more written about than 
written. No publisher's announcements are 
complete this season without a book on the 
theatre, whereas many houses seem content 
without any plays to publish. So few plays 



1914 



THE DIAL 



185 



worth publishing are being written. Mr. 
Show's are an exception. A new volume is 
to be expected from him, though no definite 
announcement of it has been made to date. 
]n addition there are a number of transla- 
tions from foreign dramatists, and a comedy, 
"Van Zorn," by the American poet, Mr. 
Edward Arlington Robinson. Of books about 
the theatre, we note "The Modern Theatre," 
by Mr. Hiram K. Moderwell : "The Modern 
Drama," by Mr. Ludwig Lewinsohn ; "The 
Changing Drama," by Mr. Archibald Hen- 
derson, and a college text-book which should 
be of general interest, Professor George P. 
Baker's "The Technique of the Drama." 

Poetry is not as well represented in the 
autumn lists as we should have liked. Mr. T. 
Sturge Moore's volume, "The Sea Is Kind," 
which contains in addition to new poems a 
selection from his earlier volumes, looms 
larger to us than anything else. A number 
of American poets are, however, to be repre- 
sented. Mr. Nicholas Vachel Lindsay, Mr. 
Harry Kemp, and Miss Harriet Monroe are 
among these. Mr. James Stephens 's new 
volume is indefinitely postponed. Mr. Frank- 
lin II. Giddings, who is professor of sociology 
at Columbia, is the author of "Pagan Poems." 
We hope they are as good as some of his 
lectures. 

The list of belles-lettres is hardly as long 
as usual, but there are a number of good 
titles in it. Mr. Henry James is publish- 
ing his "Notes on Novelists and Some Other 
Notes." Mr. Gilbert Chesterton has a new r 
volume of essays ready, except for the title. 
The famous article on poetry which Theodore 
\Vatts-Dunton wrote for the Britannica is at 
last to be reprinted. A new book on Mr. 
Shaw, an unusually sensible one, we hear, has 
been written by Mr. Joseph McCabe. Mr. 
Richard Curie has endeavored to account for 
Mr. Joseph Conrad, and to infect us with his 
enthusiasm for that admirable artist's work. 
Finally, we should like to mention Mr. Clive 
Bell's book, "Art." It is said to be a well- 
written defence of post-impressionism. 

The division of travel and exploration con- 
tains many titles but lacks a book of such 
interest as the one about Captain Scott's expe- 
dition, yet many readers will want Mr. Roose- 
velt's "Through the Brazilian Wilderness." 

Mr. Karl Pearson has already published 
the first volume of his life of Francis Galton : 
Count Ilya Tolstoy's reminiscences of his 



father will be ready shortly ; and Mr. Edward 
L. Morse's biography of his father, S. F. B. 
Morse, is announced. Of more journalistic- 
interest, perhaps, are Mr. S. S. McClure's 
"My Autobiography," "Mrs. Pankhurst's 
Own Story," and Mrs. Katherine 'Shea's 
Life of Charles Stewart Parnell. The third 
and final volume of the life of Disraeli which 
W. F. Monypenny began has been written by 
Mr. G. E. Buckle. Sir George Trevelyan has 
completed his "George III. and Charles 
Fox," the volumes making, with his previous 
four volumes on "The American Revolution," 
an unusual contribution to history. The list 
might be extended, but suffice it to say that it 
includes the usual batch on Napoleon. A num- 
ber of works of history are temporarily post- 
poned. The new volume of the "Cambridge 
Medieval History," which happens to be 
"Germany and the Western Empire," is one 
of these. Some histories will doubtless have 
to be revised next fall, or the year after, or 
whenever the war ends. And that event will 
be the occasion of several wholly new r ones, to 
say nothing of all the other sorts of books that 
it will make necessary or possible. 



THE ASIATIC AND THE GREEK SPIRIT 
IN LITERATURE. 



Matthew Arnold had a Avay of calling cer- 
tain styles of writing which he disliked "Asi- 
atic." Doubtless the specimens he had in 
view w 7 ere deserving of opprobrium, but the 
word connotes too much to be used merely in 
reproach. To the Greek mind in its clearness, 
moderation, and reasonableneas the vast, over- 
whelming, and mysterious conceptions of Asia 
were repugnant, and all who have inherited 
or been trained in the Attic mood must share 
the horror of the extravagant and the im- 
measurable. 

But after all Asia is the mother of minds, 
even of the Greek mind. ^Eschylus at least is 
Asiatic in conception and execution. The 
Greeks, however, in the main reduced every- 
thing to the measure of humanity, the gods, 
nature, philosophy. The vaster religions and 
systems of thought of Asia made but little 
account of the human unit. Where there were 
such hordes of men, man ceased to have any 
great value. 

It would be hard to overstate how much the 
world owes to the Greek reason, to its ideal of 
limited perfection in art and literature. In 
eighteen centuries it struggled in Europe 
against Asiatic ideals embodied in Christianity 



186 



THE DIAI, 



[ Sept. 16 



and Mohammedanism. Homer was pitted 
against the Bible. The Schools fought against 
the people, for the mob is always Asiatic in 
its instincts. The profound and mysterious 
elements of human thought rose again and 
again from the depths. Folk-lore wrought the 
Romantic reactions against the Classic spirit. 
On the other hand, Science with its precision 
and common sense, the naturalistic and realis- 
tic tendencies in art and literature, have been 
on the side of the Greek mood. They have 
shorn the supernatural of its power; they 
have made against the domination of the idea. 

More recently the great European philoso- 
phers have drawn from the reservoirs of Asi- 
atic thought. Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and 
Eucken to a large extent, are inspired by 
Persia and India. Vedantic, Buddhistic, Zoro- 
astrian doctrines are dominant in European 
philosophy. That the basic ideas of these doc- 
trines are essentially different from those of 
Greek thought, it would be vain to assert. But 
the Greeks gave a human, cheerful, day- 
light turn to their speculations, in comparison 
with which the huge pessimisms and nega- 
tions of Asia are appalling things of the dark. 

It seems to us that the two dominant poets 
of the last century, Victor Hugo and Lord 
Tennyson, are good exemplars, respectively, of 
the Asiatic and the Greek spirit. Their 
careers were parallel; there was storm and 
stress in Hugo's life, and stress if not storm 
in Tennyson 's ; both ended victoriously. 

Probably no one who ever lived had less use 
for the Greek virtue of "the mean" than 
Hugo. He was always dealing in extremes, 
in politics, in art, in language. Anything less 
like ordinary, average humanity than his 
gigantic and single-motived creations could 
hardly be conceived. Each of them is the em- 
bodiment of an idea and they struggle with 
other ideas embodied as natural forces or 
edicts of fate. But this is right enough. The 
day of the maker of mythologies is not over. 
In spite of realism and the photographing of 
one's neighbors, it is the great typical figures 
which stand on the forefront of literature. 
The only question about Hugo's is whether 
they have enough of the blood of humanity to 
vein their mountainlike proportions. Too 
often they seem made after a recipe: they 
are machines rather than mortals. The human 
mind never rejects the impossible, but it does 
refuse the improbable. It is not so much even 
that Hugo's people lack reality, but that they 
lack desirability. Few readers, we imagine, 
read themselves into his men and women. 

As with his creations, so with his language. 
His fiery affirmations have to be taken with a 
grain of salt. Seldom does he flower into 



speech simply and universally true. Our souls 
may be moved, shaken by his utterances but 
they recover with a "Yes, but!" He is a 
Pope who has declared his infallibility with- 
out the aid of a Council. This is particularly 
the case in regard to politics and the large 
affairs of men. With his predecessor Shelley 
and his successor Tolstoi, he stands forth as 
the protagonist of the poor and oppressed. 
He seems to think, however, that two classes 
of men, rulers and ruled, are made of different 
kinds of flesh. To him material success in life 
is a crown of infamy; poverty and failure 
the signs and sorts of saintship. We fear that 
there is no such class division of mankind into 
sheep and goats. The poor are just about as 
good and bad as the rich and powerful. The 
difference between them is due to chance, luck, 
industry, and intellect. The failings and 
faults of the great are more visible, more ad- 
vertised. And of course they can be more 
fatal to the world. 

But with all its drawbacks what a vast, sig- 
nificant, and powerful world is that projected 
by Victor Hugo. He is the supreme rhetori- 
cian of verse, a rhetorician so affluent, varied. 
and brilliant that he almost persuades you that 
art is nature. Yet we feel that his work is 
rather of the brain than of the blood. In 
lyric, ballad, and narrative poetry he falls 
short of poets whose work is the effluence of 
their whole beings; he falls short of Burns, 
Goethe, Coleridge, Keats, even of Musset and 
Verlaine. Three or four of his plays have a 
vivid life; not merely the life of the stage, 
but a phantasmal splendor that thrills us in 
the reading of them. They carry with them 
the seeds of reproduction. Without going into 
the question whether the Cyrano and L 'Aiglon 
of the living Rostand are greater or less than 
Hernani and Marion Delorme, it is obvious 
that they are of the same order. Two of his 
novels, "Notre Dame" and "The Toilers of 
the Sea, ' ' are creations from the idea, pushed 
as far as this style of work can be carried. 
They will always remain as monuments of 
what the human mind can do when playing 
with nature and humanity. Hugo 's mind was 
not unlike a kaleidoscope where a few bits of 
glass and colored ribbon can be made to evolve 
intricate and magnificent patterns. In "Les 
Miserables," however, there is more than the 
idea there is life, and it is the wide wings 
of this book which have carried Hugo's fame 
farthest over the world. Truth to nature is 
stamped upon Fantine and Cosette, Gavroche 
and Marius. It is a singular thing that God- 
win, driest of writers, should have supplied 
material for two great poets, Shelley and 
Hugo. The central theme of ' ' Les Miserables ' '

THE DIAI,

is very similar to that of "Caleb Williams," 
and Jean Valjean and Javert have their 
prototypes in the earlier book. But the dif- 
ference between the two works is like the 
difference between a tree in winter and the 
same tree plumaged with foliage, a pavilion 
of shade and a citadel of birds. 

On the whole, however, the characteristic 
feature of Hugo's work is the dominance in 
it of the idea, and it is this which relates him 
to the Asiatic type. Probably no poet more 
impresses us with vastness, profound depths, 
existence in itself. As is the case with his 
pupil Swinburne, part of this impression may 
be due to a trick. In analysis a good deal of 
his multiform variety becomes monotony. If 
one could strike out of his works a score or 
so of words infinitely repeated, such as the 
sun, stars, ocean, forest, horizon, with the 
similitudes drawn from them, the books would 
show a great shrinkage both in bulk and 
power. But a writer is entitled to any way of 
getting his effects and the effects of vastness 
and profoundity Hugo does get. 

Instead of grandiose conceptions, infinite, 
'minute detail; instead of figures "all made 
out of the carver's brain," a close rendering 
of common human nature ; instead of radical- 
ism and the propaganda of the people, con- 
servatism and the rights of property ; instead 
of mystic gleams of half the religions of the 
world, a faint-hearted acceptance of English 
ecclesiastical faith ; instead of a whirlwind of 
rhetoric, language so simple and natural that 
it seems effortless; that is Tennyson in com- 
parison with Hugo. Restricted in thought, 
ringed round with conventions, Tennyson yet 
achieves a picture of life which we accept as 
substantially true. In magical felicity of ex- 
pression, meaning, music, picture melting 
into one, he is with the most perfect poets of 
the world. And in the coinage of phrases and 
lines which become the currency of common 
speech, he ranks in English after Shakespeare 
and Pope. He realizes the Greek ideal of a 
limited perfection. He reaches the Pillars of 
Herakles, but he does not launch out into the 
unknown and discover new continents. 

It would be a fascinating task to extract 
from the sixty thousand or more lines of Ten- 
nyson's total work the body of immortal 
poetry. Fitzgerald was perfectly right in his 
preference for the earlier poems. The vol- 
umes of 1842 give nearly the full measure of 
Tennyson's greatness. There is much of his 
later work we should want to save, but little 
of it is indispensable. To write one book which 
people will read fifty times is better than to 
write fifty books which people will read only 
once. Future generations will linger long 
over the fresh, sparkling, flawless songs, bal- 



lads, and idylls of Tennyson's early prime, 
while they will give but scant regard to the 
plays of his age and pay but an awed attention 
to the long poems of his maturity. The in- 
spired singer became the conscious artist. 

"The Princess" is Shakespeare's "Love's 
Labour's Lost" brought up to date more 
elaborate but less sparkling. The trouble, 
philosophically, with "In Memoriam" is that 
it is not thorough. It has not the trumpet 
tones of victory, or the tragic wail of defeat. 
Compared with the pessimisms, negations, and 
profundities of recent philosophic thought, 
Tennyson 's meditations are lame enough. The 
poem has been eclipsed by Fitzgerald's ver- 
sion of Omar, which is itself food for babes 
beside Nietzsche's fierce perversions of Per- 
sian thought. Many of the sections of "In 
Memoriam ' ' are beautifully phrased, but they 
all seem to have been turned out of one mould. 
The later "Idylls of the King" are also turned 
out of one mould. They are inferior casts or 
copies of the first four or five pieces, whose 
bronze largenesses do loom and glitter in the 
a,rt gallery of the world. Passion and emotion 
in Tennyson are almost always subdued to 
beauty and decorum, but in "Locksley Hall" 
and "Break, Break, Break" they shatter the 
decorated crust, and "Maud" is an attempt 
to handle elemental fire in a large way. It is 
fine work, but no poet can do his best in an 
uncharacteristic direction, and Tennyson was 
not a Byron. The "Wellington Ode" is char- 
acteristic, and though on a lower level than 
the dreamily imaginative poetry of his youth, 
is Tennyson's central piece as a moral poet. 
The various ballads, humorous or romantic, 
are perhaps his best work as a creator of char- 
acter. The plays are respectable. 

Tennyson is the executant in poetry. To 
have been a great creator, he would have 
needed four or five volcanoes within him and 
a score of earthquakes outside. Even in ex- 
pression he is very far from being always 
first rate. His simplicity sometimes sinks into 
silliness and his stateliness becomes magnilo- 
quence. But except Shakespeare it would be 
hard to find any English poet who surpasses 
him in variety, charm, and perfection of lan- 
guage. CHARLES LEONARD MOORE. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



THE POET ON THE BATTLEFIELD would seem, 
to the modern view, decidedly out of his 
proper element. It is his part, we think, to 
sing of martial deeds, but not to perform 
them. Yet in classical antiquity the poet or 
other man of letters was customarily familiar 
with the use of the sword as well as with that 



188

[Sept, 10 



of the pen. Even the valetudinarian Horace, 
fond of his ease and of the pleasures of the 
table, took part, in his earlier manhood, in the 
hardships and dangers of military service in 
the field. When Brutus came to Athens after 
Caesar's death, Horace, who was pursuing his 
studies there, joined his army and was made 
military tribune, with a legion under his com- 
mand. Present at the battle of Philippi he 
came home neither with his shield nor on it; 
for he had thrown it away, ingloriously, in his 
flight with the rest of the republican army, as 
he playfully admits in one of his poems. 
Turning to the great tragic poets of Greece, we 
find them taking so active a part in the life 
about them, including offensive and defensive 
warfare, that the wonder is how they ever 
found time to write the large number of plays 
credited to -them. This difference between the 
poets of then and now is commented on by 
Professor Gilbert Murray in his recent book. 
"Euripides and his Age." He remarks: 
"Our poets and men of letters mostly live 
either by writing or by investments eked out 
by writing. They are professional writers and 
readers and, as a rule, nothing else. It is com- 
paratively rare for any one of them to face 
daily dangers, to stand against men who mean 
to kill him and beside men for whom he is 
ready to die, to be kept a couple of days fast- 
ing, or even to work in the sweat of his body 
for the food he eats. If such things happen by 
accident to one of us we cherish them as price- 
less 'copy,' or we even go out of our way to 
compass the experience artificially." It was 
this abundant dose of realism in actual hard, 
grinding, unlovely experience that so effectu- 
ally disinclined the ancients to realism in 
literature, and gave, especially to the Greek 
writers, their firm hold on sanity and common 
sense, their avoidance of sentimentality and 
paradox and all sorts of foolishness know r n to 
us of the twentieth century. ' ' A man everlast- 
ingly wrapped round in good books and safe 
living cries out for something harsh and real 
for blood and swear-words and crude jagged 
sentences. A man who escapes with eagerness 
from a life of war and dirt and brutality and 
hardship to dwell just a short time among the 
Muses, naturally likes the Muses to be their 
very selves and not remind him of the mud he 
has just washed off." Hence Euripides, who 
knew only too well the horrors and the ghastli- 
ness of real warfare, gives us only conven- 
tionalized and sterilized descriptions of battle, 
while the modern poet, who has never faced a 
loaded gun, revels in the gory details of mar- 
tial combat. But after all is said that must 
be said in praise of Greek sanity and propor- 
tion and restraint and sound common sense, it 



still remains unproved that these qualities are 
attainable only through experience of the 
ferocities of war. At any rate, there is a 
manifest difference between the hand-to-hand 
combats of antiquity and the modern whole- 
sale slaughter of the machine gun and the 
dynamite bomb. . . . 

FICTION AND FACT sometimes repeat each 
other rather closely. "We of peaceful Lon- 
don city have never beheld and please God 
never shall witness such a scene of hurry 
and alarm as that which Brussels presented. 
Crowds rushed to the Namur gate, from which 
direction the noise proceeded, and many rode 
along the level chaussee, to be in advance of 
any intelligence from the army. Each man 
asked his neighbor for news; and even great 
English lords and ladies condescended to 
speak to persons whom they did not know. 
The friends of the French went abroad, wild 
with excitement. . . . The merchants closed 
their shops, and came out to swell the general 
chorus of alarm and clamor. Women rushed 
to the churches, and crowded the chapels, and 
knelt and prayed on the flags and steps. The 
dull sound of the cannon went on rolling, roll- 
ing. Presently carriages with travellers be- 
gan to leave the town, galloping away by the 
Ghent barrier." . . . That is not copied from 
a newspaper of the present year and month, 
but from the thirty-second chapter of ' ' Vanity 
Fair," in which the panic attending the bat- 
tle of Waterloo, almost a. century ago, is so 
stirringly depicted. Side by side with that 
chapter may be placed many a true account 
of present-day conditions in the same region, 
and it is hard to decide whether the romancer 
or the veracious historian is the more vividly 
realistic. Here is a passage from a private 
letter received a few days ago. It will ex- 
plain itself. ' ' Such crowds ! We got on all 
right, and all had seats, though it was a won- 
der. . . . There was much doubt as to whether 
we should not be stopped at the frontier, as 
the train was not allowed to cross the border. 
However, when we reached there AVC found 
another train waiting for us in all about 
four hundred or five hundred people. In the 
mad rush and scramble for seats we had to 
get into a third-class carriage, which, as you 
know, on the continent has hard board seats. 
We rode in that 'cattle car' from 11 o'clock 
P.M. to 5 :30 A.M., when we finally reached 
the Hook of Holland. You can imagine it if 
you want to try, but you could never realize 
what it was like. . . . All through Germany 
we saw train loads of soldiers and of the 
recruits who had been taken from their work. 
It's all horrible and awful. When we reached 
the boat we found it already crowded beyond

its usual capacity of four hundred, and there 
were four hundred more to get on. I never 
saw such a sight people lying on the deck 
and everywhere. The only thing we could do 
was to sit on our luggage on the deck, like the 
steerage." The writer of this, an American 
woman just recovering from a long illness, 
probably had her mind too much occupied 
with nearer concerns to admit of comparing 
her situation with that of the characters in the 
above-named chapter. She finally reached 
.safety in London. 

A BOOK FOR THE PRESENT HOUR, though it is 

a book just twenty-five years old this coming 
season, is the Baroness von Suttner's "Die 
Waff en Nieder" a title that has been vari- 
ously rendered in the several English transla- 
tions of the work. "Lay Down Your Arms" 
is perhaps as good an English equivalent as 
has been hit upon in these versions. A curious 
and little-known circumstance in connection 
with the book's original publication is the 
difficulty its author experienced in finding a 
publisher courageous enough to face the ex- 
pected public disapproval and governmental 
displeasure at the appearance of so vehement 
a protest, even though in the form of fiction, 
against the prevailing militarism of Europe. 
Serial publication was first attempted, with 
repeated failure, no editor being able to per- 
suade himself that his reading public would 
tolerate so revolutionary a piece of writing. 
AVhen at last, the hope of serial issue being 
abandoned, a publisher was found for the 
story as a book, much hesitation was shown by 
him about venturing an un expurgated edition ; 
he wished to submit the work to an experi- 
enced statesman with the request that all 
passages likely to give offence be struck out. 
But of course the author indignantly refused 
to consent to this. Then the timid publisher 
pleaded for a change of title, the substitution 
of some meaningless and innocuous word or 
words in place of the ringing command chosen 
by the writer. Finally the Baroness had her 
way, and the rest is a part of literary history, 
how the book made an instant success even 
in circles where its kindly reception had been 
least of all expected; how it was speedily 
translated into a dozen languages, with two 
or more versions in our own tongue ; and how 
the author was nearly overwhelmed with con- 
gratulatory letters from readers and admirers, 
high and low. Strangely enough, however, 
among the disapproving minority were num- 
bered readers of the author's own sex, wives 
and mothers who clung to the foolish notion 
that war is romantic, the breeder of chivalry, 
the begetter of heroes. When Europe shall 
have recovered somewhat from its present fit 



of madness, the book is likely to have a second 
and, it may be, a more fruitful reading. At 
the same time, too, or even sooner, it will be 
no waste of one's leisure to read, or re-read, 
the history of the book and of its writer in 
the "Memoirs of Bertha von Suttner," which 
came out in Germany six years ago, in this 
country two years later. 


LIBRARY SCIENCE AS A REFORMATORY AGENT 
remains to be recognized by the penologists 
and criminologists and prison-reformers. In 
a recent contribution to "The Survey" is 
described the regenerative effect of cataloguing 
and classification and other work called for in 
the operation of a certain unnamed prison 
library, whose custodian was one of the invol- 
untary inmates of the institution and had at 
first shown a lawless and arbitrary disposition 
in his administration of the department as- 
signed to his charge. But an expert librarian, 
called in by the warden, led this erratic person 
(by a process similar to that of giving a man 
sufficient rope to hang himself) to see the 
time-consuming, labor-wasting error of his 
headstrong ways, and at last "the mind that 
once was only interested in picking locks and 
pulling off bank robberies found more con- 
genial problems in the intricacies of decimal 
classification. Library science had pointed 
the way. Law and order had come to have 
a place in his scheme of life. How the good 
work went on until the board of pardons 
found in him sufficient strength of character 
for a parole forms another chapter." 



LIBRARY SPIRIT UNQUELLED BY EARTHQUAKE 
AND FIRE has been splendidly shown in the 
restoring of San Francisco's public library, 
which suffered annihilation in 1906, but began 
to rise again from its ruins the same year, 
and to-day, as we are informed by its librarian, 
"stands not only rehabilitated in every de- 
partment, but has exceeded its former growth." 
Its former number of volumes, as stated in 
"News Notes of California Libraries," was 
about 166,344, and its present number is 
144,360, which seems to leave a deficit still to 
be made good in that item of equipment; but 
there is no reason to doubt its present in- 
creased activity, especially as we are told that 
"a chain of branch libraries to aggregate in 
value $375,000 has been commenced, as well as 
the new main library building," which, with 
its grounds, in the new civic centre of the city, 
will be valued at two million dollars. Can it 
be that, like so many of our most prosperous 
cities, libraries too are capable of showing 
their utmost vigor only in the face of an 
appalling calamity?

EFFECT ON LITERARY PRODUCTION, 

especially in the combatant countries, is sure 
to be harmful for the time being. When the 
national energies are chiefly concentrated in 
a life-and-death struggle, there is little sur- 
plus vitality for literature, though the rebound 
after the return of peace, more particularly if 
it is a peace achieved by victory, is likely to be 
marked by a vigorous revival of letters. A 
prominent American publisher who has just 
returned from London takes a cheerful and 
confident view of the situation in the book 
market. Admitting that for the present every- 
one is reading the newspapers, and little else, 
he foresees an early reaction and a renewed 
desire for literature as distinguished from war 
bulletins; and even though the pocket-book 
may show some flatness as a result of present 
abnormal conditions, the enforced economies 
he believes will be in the line of jewelry and 
other costly trinkets rather than in books. In 
fact, Christmas presents are likely to take the 
form of books this year, in place of the more 
expensive articles that a fuller purse would 
prompt one to buy. This is cheering, both to 
the producers of literary wares and to those 
who are interested in the spread of culture. 
Certain classes of books are singled out as not 
unlikely to be in especial demand because of 
the w r ar, including works descriptive of the 
countries engaged in the conflict, political and 
other writings throwing light on the issues 
involved, travel sketches from the pens of 
those caught in the maelstrom of international 
combat, and, not least of all, diverting novels 
as a relief and a refreshment after this super- 
abundance of horrors from the battlefield. So 
far as our own country is immediately con- 
cerned, the authority here cited admits that 
the import of books will suffer a temporary 
diminution, and American authors must wait 
for better times before they can reap large 
profits from the European sale of their works, 
but in general an early return to nearly 
normal conditions in our book-trade is ex- 
pected. ... 

PARLIAMENTARY POETICS, such as have

upon the hill to watch the train come up the 
line. . . . And did we not take great delight 
in the Loma-view and Lomaland, where along 
the boulevard auto wheels turned sunlight 
into breeze, and where within the Raja- Yoga 
bounds the songs and games of youth so capti- 
vated and charmed? We thank those who 
spent the eager night in planning, the busy 
day arranging, all for our physical comfort, 
our homely entertainment. We found our 
strenuous days were left behind, and we have 
simply breathed and looked and joyed out- 
side the meeting door." Who shall say now 
that library work begets a barren pedantry, 
a juiceless addiction to routine, a dry-as-dust 
devotion to infinitesimal minutige? It is to 
the current issue of "News Notes of Cali- 
fornia Libraries" that we are indebted for 
the foregoing frolics (there are more unquoted) 
of a resolutions committee not dead to the de- 
lights of rhetoric and the pleasures of poetry. 


THE AUTHOR OF "THE GREAT ILLUSION," 
the remarkable book that four years ago called 
attention to the preposterous folly of war, its 
economic absurdity, its political unwisdom, 
and its irreconcilable antagonism to the spirit 
of civilization and progress, is by birth an 
American, as it may be of interest to note at 
this time, and his real name is Ralph Norman 
Angell Lane, of which he uses the second and 
third constituents as a pseudonym (though 
that word is not strictly applicable in this 
instance), a pseudonym now familiar to read- 
ers of a score of nationalities, for thus widely 
has the treatise been disseminated in trans- 
lation and in its original tongue. As to the 
origin of the book, it was first written, in 
less expanded form, as a pamphlet by Mr. 
Lane in the odd moments snatched from his 
duties as editor of the Paris edition of the 
London ' ' Daily Mail, ' ' and, its tone being out 
of harmony with that journal's editorial 
policy, it appeared independently under the 
title, "Europe's Optical Illusion." At first 
it seemed to have been still-born, not a single 
reviewer giving it any notice for six weeks or 
two months. Then a distinguished public man 
in England recognized its importance and 
wrote to the author, after which three Euro- 
pean sovereigns also testified their interest by 
letter, and the early sequel was a revised and

extended form of the work, under its present 
well-known title. A quotation pertinent to 
present issues may be worth while in this 
place. "Ten years after the war [of 1870] 
Germany was a great deal worse off financially 
than her rival, and was trying, as she is trying 
to-day, to borrow money from her victim. 
. . . We know that Bismarck's later life was 
clouded by the spectacle of what he regarded 
as an absurd miracle, the vanquished recover- 
ing more quickly than the victor. ' ' When the 
turmoil now raging shall have subsided, it 
may be that the world will turn once more to 
Mr. Lane's book with an increased disposition 
to profit by its teachings. 



THE ART OF TYPOGRAPHY is discussed and 
illustrated in an agreeable and instructive 
manner by the editor of "The Newarker." 
Possibly he would not call typography an art, 
as he says "the printer is next door to the 
artist." Well, let us imagine a communicating 
passage between the two houses, and so inti- 
mate an intercourse between their occupants 
that the man of types unconsciously imbibes, 
or inhales, something of his neighbor's artist 
spirit. Certainly the designing of type is an 
art. That master typographer, the late Theo- 
dore Low De Vinne, whom Mr. Dana quotes, 
declares that "a prosperous printer will be 
more successful when he can inspire the buyers 
of printing in all its forms with the under- 
standing that meritorious printing is really a 
worthy branch of the fine arts." A passage 
from ' ' The Newarker ' ' is worth quoting here : 
"Volumes have been written on plain type 
faces. The subject is most fascinating. Print- 
ing is ever before our eyes. If you study how 
it affects you, you will soon find that mere 
legibility, as you first regard it, is not enough 
to commend a type face to you for all time." 
Nevertheless, just as good architecture implies 
suitability of form and arrangement and 
ornamentation to the purposes of the building, 
so the most legible type has the best chance of 
being the most lastingly pleasing to the eye. 
Every book season sees at least a few new 
experiments in odd and fantastic type-designs. 
All readers are familiar, for example, with the 
slanting which makes its disfiguring appear- 
ance now and then amid letters of irreproach- 
able rectitude. It is not an instance of ' ' wrong 
font, ' ' but a deliberately committed sin against 
both good taste and clear legibility. Other 
absurd departures from typographic sanity 
will be recalled by any observant student of 
print. Simplicity and modesty, freedom from 
a foolish desire to attract attention by eccen- 
tricity, are as essential to good typography as 
to polite behavior. 



EDUCATIONAL SIDE SHOWS, to appropriate an 
expressive term of President Wilson's, are 
incidentally referred to in the course of an 
article in the September "Atlantic Monthly" 
on "The Critics of the Colleges" by President 
Henry S. Pritchett of the Carnegie Founda- 
tion for the Advancement of Teaching. He 
says: "Many colleges lend the shelter of 
their charters to various technical or profes- 
sional schools which they neither support nor 
control, such as conservatories of music, com- 
mercial schools, medical schools, engineering 
schools, and graduate schools. Many a good 
college which guards its bachelor-of-arts de- 
gree with watchful care will, without the 
quiver of an eyelash, shelter a weak engineer- 
ing school or a commercial medical school of 
the lowest type. The tenderest part of the 
college conscience lies apparently in the bach- 
elor-of-arts course, and the most callous in the 
medical course. ' ' Another significant passage 
from this high educational authority is worth 
quoting here: "The amount of fraud con- 
nected with the business of soliciting money 
for colleges will astonish any one who has not 
looked into it. There are enterprises in this 
country bearing the name of college or uni- 
versity which have never taught a class, which 
have not a single college building, but which 
have for years collected money from a con- 
fiding public." President Pritchett 's article 
is of obvious timeliness at this opening of the 
academic year, and deserves careful attention 
from educators, students and their parents, 
philanthropic millionaires annually bled for 
the benefit of commercial enterprises calling 
themselves educational, and all whom the 
cause of real education directly or indirectly 
concerns. . 

A BIBLICAL SETTLEMENT OF THE SHAKE- 
SPEARE-BACON QUESTION ought to be con- 
clusive. At the late meeting called by the 
British Academy to concert plans for the 
approaching celebration of the tri-centennial 
of Shakespeare's death, the Archbishop of 
Canterbury appropriately and wittily called 
attention to the fact that the great actor- 
playwright retired from the exercise of his 
calling at the age of forty-six, in the year 
1611, the year that witnessed the publication 
of the Authorized Version of the Bible, and 
that some ingenious person has made the re- 
markable discovery that if one opens at the 
forty-sixth Psalm in that version and counts 
the words from the beginning, the forty-sixth 
word will be found to be "spear," while the 
same process of counting from the end of the 
same Psalm (omitting its concluding "selah") 
will establish the significant fact that the 
forty-sixth word is ' ' shake. ' ' In spite of an ele- 



192

merit of the topsy-turvy in this demonstration, 
or perhaps because of it, it is of precisely the 
character that should carry conviction to all 
having a taste and aptitude for the method of 
reasoning so ably expounded in "The Great 
Cryptogram" and later treatises of a similar 
ingenious character. It is true we are by no 
means certain that the precise year of Shake- 
speare's retirement from London to the peace- 
ful quiet of New Place, Stratford, was 1611, 
that event being commonly assigned to ' ' about 
the year 1610," but we should not let such a 
trifle upset the foregoing neat little demon- 
stration that Shakespeare wrote his own 
works and also translated the Bible. 



THE INFLUENCE OF THE FRENCH PRESS, felt 

to be not inconsiderable by the French them- 
selves, was humorously admitted in that jocose 
remark of Prince von Biilow concerning a dis- 
tinguished editorial writer on foreign affairs 
in the Paris "Temps." There are in Europe, 
he is quoted as saying, "three great Powers 
and M. Tardieu. " As a recent proof of 
this potency of the Paris journalist's pen may 
be cited a late occurrence of some significance 
to us just now, mentioned in Count Vassili's 
' ' France from Behind the Veil. ' ' The author 
says: "Indeed in no country do newspapers 
wield such an influence as they do in France, 
where the bourgeois, the workman, and the 
peasant believe implicitly in what the papers 
say, especially if his particular news-sheet has 
the chauvinistic opinions which he himself 
espouses. It would hardly have been possible 
to organize the magnificent reception which 
was awarded to the Emperor of Russia, if 
newspapers of all shades had not contributed 
to it their long articles written in praise of 
the future visitor and in general of the Rus- 
sian nation and the Russian army. These were 
material factors in securing the popular dem- 
onstration that took place. Thanks to them 
the Russian loans were covered several times 
over, and Russian policy, be it in the East or 
elsewhere, was warmly supported by the 
powers that ruled at the Quai d'Orsay." To 
what extent the newspaper press is recognized 
and respected by the French government is 
partly illustrated at present by the facilities 
the journals enjoy for obtaining accurate 
official war news, as contrasted with the se- 
cretive and suspicious policy that seems to 
prevail in high quarters at Berlin and London. 

THE LITERARY LIFE AND THE ACTIVE LIFE 

have each its peculiar attractions and advan- 
tages. Which is likely to be the more useful, 
which the richer in present returns, and 
which in future fame, who can predict ? Some 



thoughtful utterances on this by no means 
novel but still unexhausted theme are con- 
tributed by Mr. Arthur C. Benson to the Sep- 
tember "Century," in an essay bearing the 
well-worn caption, " Literature and Life." 
Agreeably characteristic of the writer's well- 
known manner is the following paragraph: 
' ' And yet if, on the other hand, one compares 
the subsequent fame of men of action with 
the fame of men of letters, the contrast is 
indeed bewildering. Who attaches the small- 
est idea to the personality of the Lord Lich- 
field whom Dr. Johnson envied? Who that 
adores the memory of Wordsworth knows any- 
thing about Lord Goderich, a contemporary 
prime minister? The world reads and re- 
reads the memoirs of dead poets, goes on pil- 
grimages to the tiny cottages where they lived 
in poverty, cherishes the smallest records and 
souvenirs of them. The names of statesmen 
and generals become dim except to professed 
historians, while the memories of great ro- 
mancers and lyrists, and even of lesser writers 
still, go on being revived and redecorated. 
What would Keats have thought, as he lay 
dying in his high, hot, noisy room at Rome, 
if he had known that a century later every 
smallest detail of his life, his most careless 
letters, would be scanned by eager eyes, when 
few save historians would be able to name a 
single member of the cabinet in power at the 
time of his death ? ' '

BALM IN BOOKS, as all the world knows, has 
been found by thousands on myriads of occa- 
sions. Walter Bagehot was one who knew by 
experience, if ever any one did, the soothing 
influence of a congenial author. The tragedy 
of his life, little known to the world at large, 
\\ ;is the insanity of his mother, a family mis- 
fortune that he bore as heroically as did Lamb 
the like cross laid upon him. Bagehot 's sister- 
in-law and biographer has occasion to say of 
him in one of her chapters: "I remember 
going to him to air some grievance I had 
against 'disturbing influences.' He was sym- 
pathetic and consoling; 'Get to your Ruskin. 
you will soon forget all about it.' ' 



COMMUNICATION . 

THE WOMEN OF WAGNEB. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
Mr. Moore's brilliant leader on " Lords of Mis- 
rule," in THE DIAL of August 16, is certainly con- 
vincing in so far as its main theses are concerned : 
but it seems to me that in one particular it exposes 
a misconception. Referring to Wagner and 
Nietzsche, he remarks : 

" Nietzsche revolted from Wagner because of two 
things: the latter's trend toward religion, even sacer- 



1914] 



THE DIAL 



193 



dotalism, and his attitude toward woman. Women in 
Wagner always save the situation. They are the inspir- 
ers and regenerators of man. To Nietzsche, following 
Schopenhauer, they were little better than animals." 

The ease of Wagner contra Nietzsche is full of 
complexities. There has been an enormous amount 
of discussion of the relations between the two men, 
but it is improbable that they will ever fully be 
understood. Both the Wagnerites and the Nietz- 
scheans befog the issue by partisanship, and as 
they are in possession of some of the most im- 
portant data, which they give to the world as, and 
in the form which, they see fit, the truth cannot, 
now at least, be more than approximated, despite 
the utterances of the principals themselves. But, 
sifting those facts of which we can be sure, the 
overshadowing reason for the estrangement, fol- 
lowing the close intimacy, between the composer 
and the philosopher was the thorough, not to say 
colossal, egotism which they shared in common. 
It was impossible that two such " supermen " 
should long revolve in the same orbit. Wagner, 
most particularly, was in his own circle the sun 
and its other members satellites and sun-worship- 
pers. He had no use for anyone whom he could 
not use, to express it plainly. Nietzsche had 
sought him out in a gush of enthusiasm and 
idealistic fellow-feeling, and he cherished the de- 
lusion, for several years, that this feeling was 
returned in kind. When he realized, at length, that 
it was not, that he had been made welcome at 
Triebschen and Wahnfried not for himself alone, 
but for what he was worth as a mouthpiece for the 
propaganda of their pontiff, his attitude changed. 
This, certainly, was the prime factor that made for 
the rupture, although it is certain that the 
diverging ideals of the two men, reinforced by 
their intense individualism, must in the end have 
separated them. 

But of one thing there is ample evidence' 
namely, their opinions and treatment of women. 
While Nietzsche wrote very bitterly of them, his 
personal conduct was far different. His life, con- 
sidering his era and environment, was unusually 
clean, despite the fact that letters recently dis- 
covered are said to establish the existence of an 
unacknowledged daughter, for whose welfare he 
cherished the liveliest concern. His philosophical 
doctrines regarding " the sex " and his personal 
relations with them seem to have been decidedly 
at variance. When master of his faculties he was 
always a gentleman, and those women with whom 
lie was friendly found him a delightful, even 
lovable companion. 

The manner of Wagner with women was strik- 
ingly dissimilar. Upon his own confession his 
moral lapses began early and they never ceased 
until, late in life, he concluded a lengthy series of 
affaires by eloping with the wife of his best friend. 
He had an inveterate propensity for making love 
to the wives of men to whom he was deeply obli- 
gated, and his minor peccadilloes were frequent. 
Much sympathy has been solicited for him because 
of his unfortunate first marriage but, as a 
matter of fact, while Minna Planer was not blame- 
less, Wagner was well aware of her " past " and 
indifferent to it. Indeed, we look in vain through- 



out his long life for any trace of a real ethical 
sense in his relationships with women or his atti- 
tude toward them, and the more closely we scru- 
tinize the evidence the more clearly the truth 
appears that he regarded them, socially, as instru- 
ments for the gratification of his passions, the 
furtherance of his ambitions, and the purveyance 
of his creature comforts. 

That " Women in Wagner always save the 
situation " ; that " They are the inspirers and 
regenerators of man," cannot be established from 
the study of his works. He did conceive, at one 
period of his career, the curious idea which has 
been traced to various sources but whose origin is 
immaterial that man any man who through 
his own misdeeds had jeopardized his fate, here 
and hereafter could be " redeemed " if some 
woman would sacrifice herself for him. The idea 
is fantastic and Wagner talked and wrote much 
about it in an equally fantastic way but analysis 
of his music-dramas reveals the fact that they 
support it very lamely and still more limitedly. 

Nothing of the kind can be traced in his first 
opera, " Rienzi," a mere pot-boiler, a-la-Meyerbeer, 
written around a libretto derived from the romance 
by Bulwer. The " redemption " scheme does, how- 
ever, appear in his next one, his first truly Wag- 
nerian production, " The Flying Dutchman." The 
Dutchman had wantonly offended the Deity and 
his offence could only be atoned for by the devoted 
love and voluntary self-sacrifice of a pure maiden, 
a role which he allotted to Senta. But Senta does 
not inspire, neither does she regenerate, Van- 
derdecken. On the contrary, he inspires her with 
a romantic passion only possible to a German 
heroine, and, when he becomes aware of it, turns 
to her as a sort of " first aid to the injured." But 
he speedily turns away again, and in the last act 
we behold him casting her off and sailing out to 
sea without her, whereupon she insists on throwing 
herself into the bay. To be sure we are then 
regaled with a " tableau " in which Vanderdecken 
and Senta are represented as ascending to heaven, 
quite like Little Eva in " Uncle Tom's Cabin," or 
Marguerite in " Faust," while the demon ship sinks 
forever beneath the waves. Perhaps, after a fash- 
ion, this fulfils Mr. Moore's stipulations, but it does 
so in a theatrical sense only. Otherwise, the entire 
opera is a farrago of absurdities, which had long 
since been forgotten but for the magnificent music 
which it contains. 

" Tannhauser " followed the " Dutchman." Here 
also we get the " redemption " motive. The heroine, 
Elizabeth, dies in the last act, supposably from a 
broken heart at the non-return from Rome of the 
hero, who has gone on pilgrimage there as peni- 
tence for a prolonged sojourn in the Venusberg. 
Poor Elizabeth, like many of her sex, could not 
wait. Had she done so a little longer Tannhauser 
would have returned to her safe and sound and 
forgiven for his sins, for the rod had blossomed to 
betoken that fact. When he does return and finds 
her dead, he straightway recants his repentance and 
goes over to Venus again which is not to be won- 
dered at when that goddess is impersonated, let us 
say, by Mine. Olive Fremstad, beside whom no 
Elizabeth of the present time has, to drop into the 



194

[Sept. 16 



vernacular, a ghost of a show. There is a closing 
intimation that Tannhauser will yet be saved by the 
intercessions of Elizabeth at the heavenly throne 
but of his salvation we cannot, alas, help having 
grave misgivings. 

With these two excursions, the " redemption " 
idea seems to have palled on Wagner, and with 
"Lohengrin" he abruptly transposes it into the 
masculine key. There are two female characters, 
Elsa and Ortrud. The latter is certainly one of 
the most malignant ladies known to opera, and her 
idea of saving the situation is, preferably, by 
murder. As for Elsa, she has been pronounced, in 
the words of an ardent Wagnerian, " a stupid, 
shallow, faithless creature," with the farther ver- 
dict that " So pitiable a specimen of feminine 
inquisitiveness, bad temper and ungenerosity has 
never been put on the stage as the heroine of a 
grand opera." Lohengrin saves Elsa from being 
burnt at the stake, and she requites him by vio- 
lating his most express and sacred injunction. 
Whereupon he promptly retires to the mystical 
realm of Montsalvat, whence he came; where, we 
are assured, the suggestion of Plato regarding the 
ideal republic has been adopted and ladies are not 
persona grata. 

" Tristan and Isolde " is Wagner's master-work, 
and from it we gather these items: That the 
heroine, Isolde, first endeavored to poison the hero, 
but, the fatal draught having been changed by the 
faithful Brangaene, who had other things in view 
and knew that to kill Tristan in the first act would 
never do, both partook of a love-potion, with 
entirely different results. Nevertheless, Isolde is 
not going to save Tristan, nor regenerate him. She 
does not even inspire him it was the potion 
which did that! But Isolde will be the death of 
him for, in the second act, although the perspi- 
cacious Brangaene warns her that treachery is 
afoot, she insists upon calling Tristan into the 
garden, where they are surprised and Melot gives 
him his death-blow. In the third act Tristan dies, 
and Isolde expires upon his corpse, after warbling 
the most beautiful swan-song in musical literature 
but how that saves the situation or otherwise 
does poor Tristan any good it is difficult to con- 
ceive. 

The " Meistersinger " is not opera seria, but 
glorified opera buffa. The heroine, Eva, does 
inspire the tenore di grazia, Walther, to the im- 
passioned improvisation of the " Preisleid," to her 
own great joy as well as that of the audience; but 
the saving of the situation is done by the real 
hero, good old Hans Sachs whose virtue, inci- 
dentally, is his sole reward. As for Beckmesser, 
the one member of the cast cryingly in need of 
regeneration, he fails to experience it and is hooted 
out of sight. 

Wagner's most stupendous achievement, the 
"Ring," with its tetralogy of masterpieces, fails 
altogether to support Mr. Moore's contention. It 
has many female characters, but Briinnhilde is the 
supreme and central one. From her first appear- 
ance, in " Die Walkiire," to her final immolation, in 
" Gb'tterdammerung," she is the sport of destiny 
and the prey of the gods. She would have Sieg- 



mund, but can not. She succors Sieglinde, but only 
until the latter gives birth to Siegfried, when she 
perishes miserably, like a hunted animal; Wotan, 
in the interim, having stripped Briinnhilde of her 
immortality and left her at the mercy of the first 
comer brave enough to penetrate the wall of flame 
with which she is surrounded. Siegfried proves the 
conquering hero but from the moment he links 
his fate with hers, his feet are set in the pathway 
to destruction. The " situation " goes from bad to 
worse, despite the frantic efforts of Briinnhilde; 
woe is heaped upon woe, and the " Ring " closes 
with the downfall of gods, demi-gods, and mortals, 
" in one red burial blent." The curse of the Rhine- 
gold has prevailed over them all. There is, I be- 
lieve, a work of several hundred pages, composed 
by a Perfect Wagnerite, with the impressive title, 
" The Ethics of Wagner's Ring of the Nibelungs." 
This may " save the situation " but Briinnhilde 
could not. 

"Parsifal," the work of his old age, was Wagner's 
last opera. There is but one female character 
Kundry. She begins as an infamous sort of a 
Lamia, against whose seductions Parsifal is, hap- 
pily, proof; and ends as a penitent for whose 
transformation, or, indeed, presence, it is difficult 
to account. It has been said (by Mr. Ernest New- 
man) that in Kundry Wagner sought to limn " the 
eternal and infernal womanly, the destroyer and 
the savior of man " but that " all we see upon 
the stage is a German prima-donna, stout of build 
and heavy of movement." Evidently Mr. Newman 
never saw Mme. Fremstad as Kundry, or this 
observation would not have escaped him. But 
Kundry neither saves, inspires, nor regenerates. 
She is a wicked temptress who becomes a peniten- 
tial handmaiden. The first guise, only, presents her 
to us in the active voice and then Parsifal turns 
from her in loathing and, having regenerated him- 
self, departs to dwell in mystical Montsalvat with 
Uncle or is it Papa? Lohengrin; who, as we 
know, had long since withdrawn there in order to 
get rid of Elsa, and where, as previously stated, 
ladies, whether on salvation, inspiration, or regen- 
eration bent, are, as a placard would inform us in 
Berlin, verboten. 

" Parsifal " was Wagner's farewell to his public. 
It is not exactly a glorification of the eternal fem- 
inine, but, after all, it does sum up his lifelong 
attitude toward femininity pretty accurately 
saving the fact that he was himself no Parsifal. 
For, in the beginning he liked to be tempted and 
to yield to temptation; and, latterly, required a 
willing and self-effacing " ministering angel." 
Wagner was always Wagner and, as regards 
women, beneath incredible inconsistencies his con- 
sistency never changed. He needed them, to " save 
the situation " for himself, in real life, from begin- 
ning to end. They also inspired him to the com- 
position of some of the world's most wonderful 
music but they never regenerated him, just as 
they regenerated none of his heroes. That he re- 
garded them in any light except as ministers to 
his own pleasure, vanity, and comfort, no con- 
vincing proof exists. J OHN L HERVEY.

BEHIND THE SCENES IN PARIS.* 



No small part of the interest awakened by 
Count Paul Vassili's varied and vivid mem- 
ories, chiefly Parisian, which he entitles 
"France from Behind the Veil," lies in the 
contrast between the picture he presents of 
childish irresponsibility and levity and help- 
lessness on the part of the people of the French 
capital just before the culmination of the trag- 
edy of forty-four years ago, and the present 
sober and wisely precautionary attitude of the 
same city in the face of a second similar sit- 
uation. Foolish self-confidence was fostered 
by the lying reports of military strength and 
preparedness with which his ministers and ad- 
visers deceived a ruler who was himself a past 
master in the arts of vain simulation and 
theatrical humbug. To-day, with far firmer 
ground beneath their feet, the people of Paris 
are nevertheless quietly preparing for the 
worst while hoping for the best. In September 
of 1870, as the writer had the best of oppor- 
tunities to note, 

" Life went on just as usual, and save for a few 
expressions of wonder, no one seemed quite to 
realize the importance of it. The capital began to 
prepare for the siege, rather with mirth than with 
anything else. To tell the truth, no one seemed to 
believe in its possibility, and I remember one day, 
when visiting a friend who was living on the Quai 
Malaquais, she pointed to the Seine flowing softly 
under her windows, saying at the same time: 
' Croyez-vous que les Prussiens arriveront devant 
mes fenetres comme les Normands jadis sont entres 
a Paris'?' . . . Another thing which struck me was 
that existence out of doors seemed to go on much 
as usual, in spite of the bad news that continued 
to pour in. The theatres were full, and people 
seemed to make the most of the late summer days 
that were coming to a close. There was very little 
excitement, and the feeling that predominated was 
one of curiosity. Some people were departing, but 
not in large numbers, and it was only towards the 
end of September that people began seriously to 
look at the situation." 

The author had been appointed in 1868 sec- 
retary* to the Russian embassy at Paris, and 
though he prudently withdrew from the 
threatened city while withdrawal was still pos- 
sible, he returned at the earliest opportunity 
and even during his absence kept himself in- 
formed through correspondence as to the prog- 
ress of events in the capital. He tells us he 
received letters by balloon and by carrier- 
pigeons. One of these messages, written in 
late September by "an American who had

and Political Life. By Count Paul Vassili. Illustrated.

elected to remain in Paris during the siege," 
contains the following, so different in tone 
from the letters now coming to outsiders from 
the same quarter : 

" The government does nothing, and when I have 
said this, I say everything. They say that they 
can do nothing and that it is to the Tours delega- 
tion they must look for an attempt to stop the 
progress of the Prussian army. So long as Gam- 
betta was here there was some activity in minis- 
terial offices; now he has gone there is absolute 
stagnation. All these ministers, suddenly called 
upon to exercise functions for which they were 
totally unprepared, seem lost, and Jules Favre 
looks at the political situation with the same eye 
he would look at some big criminal or civil law 
case from the outlook of an advocate, not from 
that of a statesman. They say he actually cried 
during his conversation with Bismarck. The ques- 
tion arises whether these tears were genuine ones 
of grief, or simply a rhetorical incident." 

Readers of republican predilections will find 
in Count Vassili 's pages little reason to regret 
the downfall of the Second Empire, though he 
paints the portrait of its sovereign in rather 
attractive colors and presents to us a quite 
ravishing albeit weak-minded Empress Eu- 
genie. Napoleon III. is seen at his best in the 
following paragraph : 

" The Emperor's was essentially a kind nature. 
During the eighteen years of his reign he did an 
enormous amount of good, and certainly France 
owes to him a good deal of her present prosperity. 
He thought about his people's welfare more than 
had any previous Sovereign; the economic ques- 
tion was one to which he had given his most 
earnest attention. He wanted his country to be 
strong, rich, an example to others in its energetic 
progress along the path of material and intel- 
lectual development. He was a lover of art; he 
was a keen student, an admirer of literature; and 
he appreciated clever men. Catholic in his tastes, 
he had the rare faculty of forgetting the wrongs 
done to him, in the remembrance of the many 
proofs of affection he had experienced. Gifted 
with a sweet and sunny temperament, he had been 
brought up in the school of adversity. Amidst all 
the grandeur that he enjoyed later on, he never 
forgot the lesson; and when misfortune once more 
assailed him, he was never heard to murmur, or to 
reproach those whose incapacity had destroyed his 
life's work." 

An incident that helps to strengthen the 
conviction that the Emperor was hurried into 
a rash war by unwise counselors is related by 
the author. When the Russian secretary went 
to congratulate Napoleon on the gratifying 
results of the Plebiscite of May, 1870, that 
imperial personage, though it was most un- 
usual for him to compromise his dignity by 
such a demonstration of feeling, did not at- 
tempt to conceal his delight, but openly de- 
clared that the Plebiscite "had not only 



196

consolidated the dynasty, but also had done 
away with the legend that represented him as 
desirous of a foreign \var in order to add to 
his prestige." He added exultantly: "No 
one can say so at present, because, after 
France has so positively affirmed its allegiance 
to the Empire, it would be madness for me 
to risk losing popularity through a war which, 
even if victorious, would nevertheless mate- 
rially impoverish the country. ' ' But he seems 
not to have noticed, or to have wilfully disre- 
garded, the fact that the vote of Paris was 
hostile to him; and Paris then, as so often 
before, was potent in the making and unmak- 
ing of governments and rulers. 

From the many excellent pen portraits that 
the book contains, and that in fact make up 
the bulk of its contents, a few will here be 
chosen for partial reproduction. The artist 
lets us know that he had familiar access to all 
the most distinguished and interesting persons 
present in Paris at the time of his sojourn 
there, and we are not unwilling to accept his 
good offices and make their acquaintance 
through his pages. Of Thiers he writes : 

" I had known him even before I came to Paris 
in an official capacity, had often seen him at the 
houses of some mutual friends, and we came to 
know each other very well. He was one of the 
cleverest, nicest little men in the world, and even 
among the many interesting people who abounded 
in France at that time he stood out conspicuously 
as one of the pleasantest. He had many enemies, 
which is not to be wondered at if one takes into 
consideration the vivacity which he always dis- 
played in his likes and dislikes, and the bitterness, 
or rather the caustic tendencies, of his tongue. 
But friends and foes alike were loud in their praise 
of his intelligence, and especially of his wit. . . . 
During the whole reign of Louis Philippe, M. 
Thiers Avas a conspicuous figure in Paris society, 
and, strange to relate, this petit bourgeois had 
succeeded in entering the most exclusive circles of 
the Faubourg St. Germain, and contrived to install 
himself in the favours of its leaders, masculine as 
well as feminine. He was essentially the type of a 
middle-class man, in spite of the high offices which 
he had held, and never could rid himself of the 
habit of tying a napkin round his neck at meals, 
when he was in his family circle, neither would he 
go out without the umbrella that remained the 
distinctive sign of that epoch still known as the 
' epoque de Louis Philippe/ where the bourgeoisie 
reigned supreme, and where the Sovereign tried 
by all means to win for himself the sympathies of 
the mob by coming- down to its level." 

The following characteristic passage gives a 
glimpse of a recently deceased French writer 
of note. 

" I have met most of the celebrities of modern 
France at the Due d'Aumale's lunches. He was 
very catholic as to the people whom he invited, 
and only required them to be amiable and to listen 



well to him, without attempting to interrupt. 
Among his great friends was Jules Leinaitre, the 
Academician, an amusing, intelligent little man, 
rather void of manners, who buzzed about in a 
way that would have been aggressive had it not 
been so funny. He was full of wit, but sometimes 
said gauche things, the value of which did not 
appear to strike his otherwise critical mind." 

Concerning another and a greater author, 
and his chief work, the following is of in- 
terest : 

" Taine used to spend the greater part of the 
year at Menthon, in Savoy, on the borders of the 
Lake of Annecy, and it was during a visit which 
I paid him there, from Aix-les-Bains, where I was 
undergoing a cure, that I had with him the longest 
and perhaps the most interesting conversation in 
the whole time of our intercourse with each other. 
We discussed many subjects, and among others his 
great work, the ' Origines de la France Contem- 
poraine.' . . . He hated anarchy, lie thought it his 
duty to show it up in all its vivid horror, and he 
tried to write the story of that tragedy with the 
same impartiality he would have brought to bear 
on the description of it in any other country than 
his own. As he told me on that day : l C'est un 
pauvre patriotisme que celui qui s'imagine que 
Fon doit excuser les crimes de son pays, simplement 
par ce qu'on en est un citoyen.' " 

In this connection may be noted the author's 
rather rash assertion, on an earlier page, that 
' ' patriotism with Frenchmen is mostly a ques- 
tion of words; it rarely goes beyond phrases, 
full of enthusiasm but devoid of real mean- 
ing." French love of country and French 
readiness to make the last sacrifice for coun- 
try are too well attested, too apparent at this 
very moment, to admit of question; and the 
author himself, in the course of his narrative, 
cites several instances of conspicuously patri- 
otic conduct on the part of distinguished 
Frenchmen he has known. 

The writer believes himself to have made a 
few original contributions to French history 
of the later nineteenth century. For example, 
he was one of those who visited the Tuileries 
on the evening of that memorable fourth of 
September which saw the fall of Napoleon 
III. No one then knew what had become of 
the Empress, though all sorts of rumors were 
in the air, and when he visited the Palace he 
found that no one there believed she had taken 
flight. "Indeed," he adds "and this is a 
detail that I believe has never been recorded 
elsewhere I found one of her maids pre- 
paring her bed as usual !" And again, speak- 
ing of the Comte de Chambord, he says : ' ' One 
has spoken of the flag and of the reluctance 
of the Pretender to accept the tricolour, but 
what has never been revealed to this day is 
that a compromise had been suggested by a 
clever French politician who had been con- 



1914 j

suited." This compromise was that the tri- 
colour should continue to be the national flag 
while the white banner of his ancestors should 
be the new monarch's personal emblem and be 
borne before him on all occasions of ceremony. 
But even this not dishonorable arrangement 
was finally rejected by the high-principled de- 
scendant of Louis XIV. The details of this 
affair the writer believes have not hitherto 
been fully understood by the world at large. 

Like his former work, "Behind the Veil at 
the Russian Court," Count Vassili's present 
volume is full of the curious political infor- 
mation possibly sometimes misinformation 
- and personal gossip with which a veteran 
diplomat is likely to find his memory well 
stored as he looks back over his professional 
career, and he writes in a way to hold the 
attention, though his anonymous translator 
leaves something to be desired on his part. The 
work is well illustrated.

DRUMMOND OF HAWTHOKNDEN.* 



When one sees William Drummond of Haw- 
thornden \vhose very name along with Kit 
Marlowe's and Michael Drayton's had such a 
special fragrance for Charles Lamb, in a 
smartly bound two-volume edition with an ap- 
paratus of cuts, variant readings, and notes on 
sources that would do credit to an editor of a 
Greek poet, one is likely to receive such a labor 
of love with a rather absurd ungraciousness. 
One remembers the epitaph which Drummond, 
in a lovely sonnet, requested Sir William 
Alexander to engrave on his stone. 

" Here Damon lies, whose songs did sometime 

grace, 

The murmuring Esk; may roses shade the 
place!" 

Turning from these quiet-colored lines, one 
feels for a moment that such a monumental 
edition of Drummond as that of Professor 
Kastner is in positively bad taste. To be sure 
this is largely dilettanteish sentimentality. 
Yet Professor Kastner has not given us the 
Drummond that we are likely to pull down 
from our shelves over and over again. And 
we have a right to tax him with leaving 
his edition so meagre in intimate, beautiful 
utterances about Drummond by famous critics, 
We have a right to tax the editor with his own 
severe refusal to say much of anything him- 
self about Drummond, except to weigh gen- 
eral estimates coldly, to make bare citations

DEN. Edited by L. E. Kastner. M. A. In two volumes.

& Co. 



of sources, to list editions and portraits. Of 
course, this is the orthodox way of producing 
critical editions under the shadow of universi- 
ties. And Professor Kastner has done the 
orthodox thing with a care that reveals his 
patient years of research. But why must such 
work be forever divorced from the utterances 
quaint and shrewd and magical that might 
tempt a few who are not literary ascetics to 
turn the pages of this charming old recluse 
who proves after all to be so far the reverse of 
ascetic himself? Is it not as important to 
quote and comment at length on the odd but 
strangely acute phrases of Milton's nephew, 
Edward Phillips, for instance, as to unearth 
an obscure Italian source of a love-sonnet ? To 
me that estimate of Drummond which David 
Masson has so plausibly conjectured to show 
the influence of Milton himself is a phrase 
that, should be carefully weighed in every com- 
plete edition. Drummond, says Phillips or 
Milton, was ' ' A genius the most polite and ver- 
dant that ever the Scottish nation produced. ' ' 
The ideal editor of Drummond should write a 
paragraph on that one bizarre but most ex- 
pressive word ' ' verdant. ' ' 

For while Drummond 's amorous and reli- 
gious poetry seems to the reader, in the languor 
that Drummond often begets, to be alike in a 
golden monotone there is in that golden mono- 
tone a quiet life that is perpetually alluring 
however close the dependence on a model or 
however interminable the recurrence of fa- 
vored and self-indulging phrases. Whoever 
the French or Italian whom Drummond bet- 
tered, whatever the reiteration of subject or 
mood, there is the transforming alchemy of 
the man Drummond and his beloved retreat 
Hawthornden which David Masson has de- 
scribed in a manner which now seems of an 
archaic school of criticism because of its tinge 
of sentimentalism and its incorrigibly garru- 
lous ways, but which, faded as it may be, has 
that faint fragrance about it which does not 
lull but quietly awakens. You ponder at lei- 
sure with the critic about the origin of certain 
mysterious caves said to be once the hiding 
place of Bruce and you wonder whether they 
were the dark strongholds of ancient Pictish 
kings. 

" Whether of Pictish antiquity, or of later, 
puzzles your powers of conjecture; but it is witli 
an increased respect for the whole mansion that 
you emerge again in the open air, after having 
seen what ghastly secrecies of some inscrutable 
past underlie its rocky foundations. It is with this 
sense that after observing whatever else is ap- 
parent to close inspection of the exterior, you 
continue the walk which leads from it, on one side 
of the romantic glen, in the direction of Roslin. 
Turning in this path to look at the house now and

again, at points where there is an opening through 
the trees, you see it as artists most delight to take 
it, a tall mass of gables and pinnacles shooting 
aloft from its crazy socket in the ravine. So 
leaving it, you may follow the path till it brings 
you down to a wooden bridge crossing the Esk. 
This bridge has a gate on it, so constructed that, if 
you pass through, you cannot reopen it from the 
other side. If you do pass it, you are in the public 
pathway, two miles of which will take you, still 
through the depths of the glen, with the stream 
now on your left, to the castle and Chapel of 
Roslin. But, if you would rather keep the sen- 
sation of Hawthornden unmixed, then, though it 
is unusual, there is nothing to prevent you from 
stopping your walk at the bridge and retracing 
your steps so as to renew your sight of the house 
in all the aspects in which you have already beheld 
it, only in reversed order. A noble old sycamore, 
just in front of the house, five hundred years old 
at least, may then arrest your attention, as well 
as the clipped clumps of yew which you noticed 
before. And so, regaining the road by the ascend- 
ing avenue, you have seen Hawthornden and will 
remember it forever." 

This pleasant glimpse of Drummond's re- 
treat, with some reflection about the pecu- 
liarly melancholy, yet serene life-giving magic 
which we may well assume to be its perennial 
properties, will help us as we read the poems 
themselves to understand precisely that sober 
freshness in Drummond's style which Milton 
or Phillips described with the queer but most 
happy adjective "verdant." 

But all this places a little too much empha- 
sis on Drummond, the dreamer. All supreme 
artists are equally dreamers and doers. Drum- 
mond was not a supreme artist and his dream- 
ing overbalanced his doing. But in order to 
appreciate fully his poetry we must remember 
that he was not a mere dreamer. To be sure 
his dabblings in military mechanics (in which 
he emulated at a great distance the versatility 
of Leonardo da Vinci and other supreme 
artists of the Renaissance) , are not reassuring. 
King Charles granted the poet a letter patent 
for a number of proposed inventions includ- 
ing among more than a dozen others equally 
miraculous : 

" Instruments of the mortar or siphon kind 
whereof the one, on account of its signal use in 
defending walls and ships, and its truly wonderful 
speed, is called nTMToaKefiaannov , vulgarly, The Flat- 
Scourer; the other, because of its special utility 
for shattering the masts, sails, rigging, and oars of 
ships, receives the name ''EvOvrftriTiKov, vulgarly, 
The Cutter." 

We turn with a smile from Drummond the 
mechanic to Drummond the politician. Here 
we find him, like Milton, with a song dying 
on his lips as he turns eagerly to write politi- 
cal pamphlets but not on Milton's side. 
Drummond does not seem to have gone much 



from his quiet retreat in his long and quixotic 
championship of King Charles. But his pen 
proved fluent and very cogent. Let the poet's 
readers remember his defiant pamphlets writ- 
ten when the Puritans were rapidly sweeping 
over all. Judicious readers can then return 
to the richly colored courtier poems that came 
from quiet Hawthornden with a feeling that 
they glow more with conviction than with a 
base fire for preferment. Eeaders may even 
return with a delighted smile to that most 
attractive youthful hyperbole in "Teares on 
the Death of Moeliades" (1613), Drummond's 
first publication, an elegy on the early death 
of Prince Henry so widely mourned by the 
young poets of the Jacobean era. 

" Moeliades, that by Ister's streams, 
Amongst shrill-sounding trumpets, naming gleams 
Of warm encrimsoned swords, and cannons' roar, 
Balls thick as rain poured by the Caspian shore, 
Amongst crushed lances, ringing helms and 

shields, 

Dismembered bodies ravishing the fields 
In Turkish blood made red like Mars's star, 
Thou ended hadst thy life and Christian war; 
Or, as brave Burbon ; thou hadst made old Rome, 
Queen of the world, thy triumph's place and 

tomb! 

And in dear arras virgins fair had wrought 
The bays and trophies to thy country brought ; 
While some new Homer, imping pens to fame, 
Deaf Nilus' dwellers had made hear thy name." 

Readers remembering Drummond 's unflinch- 
ing loyalty in the dark days of the Stuarts 
will also read from a later poem, with a de- 
light unalloyed by morbid distrust, these 
charmingly inappropriate and fantastic prom- 
ises to King James if he will but tarry long 
in his visit to Scotland. 

" The wanton wood-nymphs of the verdant spring 
Blue golden, purple flowers shall to thee bring ; 
Pomona's fruits the panisks; Thetis' girls 
Thy Thule's amber with the ocean pearls; 
The Tritons, herdsmen of the glassy field, 
Shall give thee what far-distant shores can yield, 
The Serian fleeces, Erythrean gems, 
Vast Plata's silver gold or Peru streams, 
Antarctic parrots, Ethiopian plumes, 
Sabaean odours, myrrh, and sweet perfumes; 
And I, myself, wrapt in a watchet gown, 
Of reeds and lilies on my head a crown, 
Shall incense to thee burn, green altars raise, 
And yearly sing due paeans to thy praise." 

But the court poems are too garish to repre- 
sent what, despite Drummond's love of con- 
ventional mannerisms, I have called his sober 
freshness. His love poems will serve our pur- 
pose better. Here we find the recluse. Con- 
tent in his own words, "Content with my 
books and the use of my eyes, I learnt even 
from boyhood to live beneath my fortune ; and 



1914] 



THE DIAL 



199 



dwelling by myself as much as I can, I neither 
sigh for nor seek aught that is outside me." 
Always ready to hurl a courageous pamphlet 
in the teeth of Puritan and Covenanter when 
a beloved Stuart needed defence, Drummond 
was nevertheless much happier as far as his 
personal interests were concerned, when he 
could write unmolested of the mystery of the 
universe or of the glories and sorrows of 
earthly love. In these days when it is still 
fashionable among students of English litera- 
ture to explain away all Petrarchan love 
affairs, there nevertheless arises no reason for 
doubting the story of Drummond 's youthful 
mistress and her untimely death. To be sure 
Petrarch mourned the death of his Laura, and 
Drummond 's sonnets are often but para- 
phrases of French and Italian Petrarchans. 
But the critic who questions Drummond 's sin- 
cerity for such reasons is truly purblind from 
having looked too long at books and too little 
at life. Two lovely moods predominate in 
Drummond 's best love poems, two moods so 
mutually sympathetic that they seem to blend 
readily in that golden monotone which I have 
already noted as characteristic of Drummond. 
Though one of these moods is that of exalta- 
tion it is an exaltation which (I say it without 
fear of a phrase which contradicts itself) is 
so pensive and gentle that it has intimate kin- 
ship with the other mood, the melancholy of 
bereavement. Turn to one of his most beau- 
tiful lyrics of exaltation. 

" Like the Idalian queen, 
Her hair about her eyne, 

With neck and breast's ripe apples to be seen, 
At first glance of the morn, 
In Cyprus' gardens gathering those fair flow'rs 
Which of her blood were born, 
I saw, but fainting saw, my paramours. 
The Graces naked danc'd about the place, 
The winds and trees amaz'd 
With silence on her gaz'd; 
The flow'rs did smile, like those upon her face, 
And as their aspen stalks those fingers band, 
That she might read my case, 
A hyacinth I wish'd me in her hand." 

Now this is exaltation but exaltation far 
removed from that of Spenser's exaltation in 
the "Epithalamion." It is exaltation, but an 
exaltation so gentle and timorous that it is 
half prophetic and we expect to pass with but 
the ghost of a modulation to the exquisite 
elegiac key that comes with the death of the 
beloved. 

" My lute, be as thou wast when thou didst grow 
With thy green mother in some shady grove, 
When immelodious winds but made thee move, 
And birds on thee their ramage did bestow. 
Sith that dear voice which did thy sounds ap- 
prove, 



Which used in such harmonious strains to flow, 

Is reft from earth to tune those spheres above, 

What art thou but a harbinger of woe? 

Thy pleasing notes be pleasing notes no more, 

But orphan wailings to the fainting ear; 

Each stop a sigh, each sound draws forth a tear, 

Be, therefore, silent as in woods before; 

Or, if that any hand to touch thee deign, 

Like widowed turtle still her loss complain." 

Now if the modern reader, used to consid- 
ering the thrust and sting of the modern love 
lyric as the only badge of sincerity, is troubled 
and dubious over the quaintly and conven- 
tionally cut jewels of Petrarchanism let him 
turn for a luminous commentary on this sober 
freshness for a proof of the sincerity of this 
golden monotone, to the reticent but strangely 
intimate words written by the poet to Sir 
William Alexander four years after the loss 
of the beloved. 

"And therefore, that now I live, that I enjoy a 
dear idleness, sweet solitariness, I have it of Him 
and not from Man. Trust in Him; prefer not to 
certainties uncertain hopes. Conspiravit in dolores 
nostros haec aestas; sola Dies potent tantum 
lenire dolorem, for we have what to plain and 
regret together and I what alone I must lament." 

But Drummond 's greatest mood, one which 
neither the memory of the breathing and warm 
body of his mistress nor the loyalty which 
always beat for King James and King Charles 
could keep long from the spirit that clung so 
close to the shadows and wayward lights of 
Hawthornden, was a favorite mood of those 
Elizabethan predecessors, his poetic brethren : 
the long pondering over "this vapour, smoke, 
or spark called Life," the contemplation of 
mutability, the earnest scrutiny of the signs 
of a life hereafter. Like his Elizabethan kins- 
men who achieved with such a large practical 
sense, not like the more restricted orthodox, 
but like the equally pagan and Christian men, 
the Marlowes, the Spensers, the Raleighs, the 
Shakespeares, Drummond realized that medi- 
tation on eternal things, the destiny of man 
was of the first practical importance in the 
conduct of ordinary daily life. In our genera- 
tion, when most church-goers are irreligious be- 
cause of their lassitude (that deadly sin which 
the old ecclesiaste called sloth, accidia) and 
because in their lassitude they listen to pastors 
who talk languidly about "practical Chris- 
tianity" (a phrase which really means positiv- 
ism or mere social morality without religion) , 
men may well go to Drummond to learn that 
perspective which comes only from true reli- 
gious meditation and without which, as Drum- 
mond 's countryman Carlyle warned us only 
a generation ago, no race can survive for long. 
One does not need to take the mythological lit- 
eralness of the following sonnet as gospel nor 



200

even believe in anything like the concept at 
the heart of it to realize that it has a spa- 
ciousness of reflective power, the lack of which 
is one of our gravest and most paralyzing 
checks to progress, not only among the deso- 
late pews of a modern church but in the slums 
where we would grip the throat of Poverty 
and try to look steadily at his blue lips and 
leering eyes. 

" If with such passing beauty, choice delights, 
The Architect of this great round did frame 
This palace visible, which World we name, 
Yet silly mansion but of mortal wights; 
How many wonders, what amazing lights, 
Must that triumphing seat of glory claim 
Which doth transcend all this great All's high 

heights, 

Of whose bright sun ours here is but a beam! 
blest abode! happy dwelling place! 
Wbere visibly th' Invisible doth reign ! 
Blest people, who do see true beauty's face, 
With whose dark shadows He but earth doth 

deign, 

All joy is but annoy, all concord strife, 
Matched with your endless bliss and happy life." 

There is at once, I say, something suffocat- 
ing in this apparently orthodox primness and 
conventional imagery and something liberat- 
ing in its bold flight into the universe where 
we must all soar freely at times if we really 
hope to cleanse the terrible finiteness of our 
tenement districts. 

I am not urging that old doctrine which 
makes many modern reformers so impatient. 
I do not recommend the prayer of the reli- 
gious quietist who then goes about his own 
business and leaves God to do the social re- 
forming. I merely assert that a passionate 
contemplation of the universe is essential to 
practical reform. This we have forgotten and 
this we can learn again in the quiet and stead- 
fast glow of Drummond 's poetry, or even more 
beautiful, I think, his noble prose threnody of 
mankind, "The Cypress Grove," especially in 
the great skeptical or mournful passages that 
precede the calm faith of the close. Death, as 
it seems to many, 

" Death is the sad estranger of acquaintance, the 
eternal divorcer of marriage, the ravisher of chil- 
dren from their parents, the stealer of parents 
from their children, the interrer of fame, the sole 
cause of forgetfulness, by which the living talk of 
those gone away as of so many shadows, or 
fabulous paladins. . . . The ruins of fanes, palaces, 
and other magnificent frames, yield a sad prospect 
to the soul, and how should it consider the wreck 
of such a wonderful masterpiece as is the body 
without horror?" 

The poet rises quickly from personal fear to 
a calm and spacious vision. 

" This is the highway of mortality, our general 
home; behold what millions have trod it before 



thee, what multitudes shall follow after thee, with 
them which at that same instant run! In so uni- 
versal a calamity, if Death be one, private com- 
plaints cannot be heard; with so many royal 
palaces, it is small loss to see thy poor cabin burn. 
. . . Thy death is a piece of the order of this All." 

Like an impetuous Elizabethan adventurer on 
seas and in majestic dreams, Drummond is 
almost eager for death that he may enrich his 
knowledge now so imperfect, that he may 
understand better man's blind, audacious 
aspirations. For here on earth : 

" Science, by the diverse notions of this globe of 
the brain of man, are become opinions, nay, errors, 
and leave the imagination in a thousand labyrinths. 
What is all we know compared with what we know 
not ? We have not yet agreed about the chief good 
and felicity." 

Yet even here one may become greater with a 
glimpse, at least, of Eternity for 

" This Sun, that Moon, these Stars, the varying 
dance of the spring, summer, autumn, winter is 
that very same which the Golden Age did see." 

Who would not be tempted to hasten to know 
more? Whom the gods love die young. 
Wherein is the pathos ? 

" Life is a journey on a dusty way; the furthest 
rest is death. In this, some go more heavily bur- 
dened than others: swift and active pilgrims come 
to the end of it in the morning, or at noon which 
tortoise-paced wretches, clogged with the frag- 
mentary rubbidge of this world, scarce with great 
travel crawl unto at midnight." 
For can any seek substitute for a knowledge 
of eternity in that which we call on earth 
fame? 

" The huge Egyptian Pyramids, and that grot in 
Pausilipo, though they have wrestled with Time, 
and worn upon the vast of days, yet are their 
authors no more known than it is known by what 
strange earthquakes and deluges isles were divided 
from the continent, or hills bursted forth of the 
valleys." 

So our poet ponders until Neo-Platonism 
and Christianity, wedded with no conflict in 
his renaissance mind, teach him that he him- 
self is a master of the universe through his 
soul, "an image of that unsearchable Trinity 
in three essential powers, understanding, will, 
memory. ' ' 

Nowadays our amorous poets do not dare to 
write sonnets in the form of catalogues vaunt- 
ing the superiority of their lady's eyes over 
diamonds, the moon, the sun, lightning; nor 
do they venture to sing of the Trinity. These 
things would be considered insincere in our 
generation, or by many lifeless. Here, on the 
contrary, is the note that pierces the modern 
reader. 
" I have forgot much, Cynara, gone with the wind, 

Flung roses, roses riotously with the throng, 
Dancing to put thy pale lost lillies out of mind."

Beside this how antiquated appear such lines 
as these of Drummond : 

" As in a dusky and tempestuous night, 
A star is wont to spread her locks of gold, 
And, while her pleasant rays abroad are roll'd, 
Some spiteful cloud doth rob us of her sight; 
Fair soul, in this black age so shin'd thou bright, 
And made all eyes with wonder thee behold, 
Till ugly Death, depriving us of light, 
In his grim misty arms thee did enfold." 

A hundred young men read Dowson now 
while one reads Drummond. Neither poet 
will, I think, be forgotten, though Dowson 's 
audience will shrink and he, too, will seem 
antiquated. Perhaps Drummond 's love poems 
will then seem greater because they minister 
so calmly yet tenderly to a mind diseased. 
And a generation more religious than ours will 
forgive the old poet his occasional theological 
creakiness as that generation will forgive his 
stiff hyperbole. For that generation will have 
no longer the morbid fear of " other- worldli- 
ness ' ' which some of our ethical teachers would 
instil in us, but that generation will realize 
how through " other- worldliness" comes the 
perspective and firm grasp which alone can 
make us truly practical in our most earthly 
worldliness. HERBERT ELLSWORTH CORY. * 



THE QUINTESSENCE or "MODERNITY."* 



In the age of impressionism, criticism be- 
comes relentless in its betrayal of the critic. 
The expositor of the traits and features, the 
foibles and frailties, of the contemporary in 
art is the patent victim of his own analysis. 
If he is peculiarly susceptible to certain influ- 
ences in modern thinking, specific features of 
current emotionalism, nothing so readily ex- 
poses this susceptibility as his own thinking, 
his own emotionalism in the face of modern 
art-works. For being contemporary with the 
subjects of his consideration, he inevitably re- 
veals them on the side of his own sensitivity. 

These observations have pertinent applica- 
tion to the volume of Mr. Samuel's studies, 
dealing with ''modernities" so diverse as 
Stendhal and Wedekind, Heine and Strindberg, 
Nietzsche and Marie Corelli with Disraeli, 
Schnitzler, Verhaeren, Marinetti. The method 
of these "studies" or better, literary diver- 
sions is very simple. Throw in a paragraph 
of heavy brush-work generalization ; lighten up 
the perspective with a few biographical details 
to give an impression of background; then 
sketch in a poster of the literary figure on 
the strength of a few dominant characteristics 
which seem to persist throughout his pub-

lished works. The result is much the same 
in every case : the essay, springing up with all 
the flabbiness and rapidity of a fungus growth, 
reveals the subject not as an organic product 
of his environment and his period, but as a 
mushroom, an excrescence upon the surface of 
the age. The author is widely read in mod- 
ern literature; his writing undulates with 
allusiveness. Yet his penchant for the flashy 
and the ephemerally clever, his predilection 
for the erotic and the sensual, give to "mod- 
ernity" a meaning at once evanescent and re- 
pellent. This book is clever, impertinent, 
sacrilegious, salacious a reminder of the 
work of the late Percival Pollard, or of the 
German critic, Alfred Kerr. 

It would not be unfair, perhaps, to call this 
book a study, con amore, of modern eroticism 
were it not for the saving grace of the 
studies of Nietzsche and Disraeli. The spir- 
itual struggle in all great contemporary think- 
ing, the growing sense of a responsibility 
transcending the scope of the individual, the 
recognition of the problematic nature of life 
in the sphere of moral relationship and the 
necessity for reconciliation between instinctive 
passion and self-control these one excludes 
from the category of the spirit here fatuously 
labelled "modernity." The author modestly 
confesses, at the end of a long essay on Strind- 
berg : " It is impossible casually to brush the 
man aside as some mere paranoiac." What a 
narrow escape for Strindberg! who, but for 
this confession of the author, might now be 
lost in the oblivion of Mr. Samuel's condemna- 
tion as "some mere paranoiac." The serious 
purpose, the ferocious forthrightness of 
Wedekind escapes him utterly; he can only 
revel in the riotous sensuality, the wild shame- 
lessness of Wedekind 's most plebeian pranks. 
Of the author of that marvellous poem of 
' ' Fruhlings-Erwachen, ' ' the poignant tragedy 
of enforced sex-ignorance and betrayed inno- 
cence, he can only say in a paragraph of 
summation : " It is for his fiendish delectation 
that he plies his knout on that world of abnor- 
malities called into existence for this express 
purpose, and writhing prettily in the mos^ 
ingenious of dances." The purposive note of 
Schnitzler the author of "Liebelei" 
eludes one who can recommend for perusal 
the unmentionable "Reigen"; and upon the 
conclusion, the genuine tragic conclusion, of 
"Liebelei" we have this eloquent comment: 
"Our fin de siecle Ophelia rushes madly out 
of the house to commit suicide in the nearest 
brook ... to point the philosophic moral, 
1 A has la grande passion! Vive I' Amour- 
ette!' ' Dr. Schnitzler, for all his monot- 
onous preoccupations with the problems of

promiscuity, is one of the most subtly artistic 
dramatists of the present era. Yet it is his 
tolerance for frailty, for infidelity, rather than 
the magic of his artistry, which wins the gen- 
erous approbation of his equally tolerant 
interpreter. 

The style of this book, while direct and for 
the most part expressive, is marred by the 
extravagance of its imagery, its adjectival 
superfluity, and the contortions of its pseudo- 
cleverness. ' ' The bitten mind barks savagely 
back at its own mad image" is inspired by 
Verhaeren's line: 

" Les chiens du noir espoir ont aboye ce soir." 

Stirred by the cycle of Signor Marinetti's "Le 
Demon de la Vitesse," he thus gets under 
way : ' ' For now the poet, stoking the engines 
of his pounding brain with the monstrous coals 
of his own energy, drives his train of J^schy- 
lean images (well equipped with all the latest 
modern inventions) with all the record-break- 
ing rapidity of some trans- American express, 
from the 'vermilion terraces of love,' across 
'Hindu evenings,' 'tyrannical rivers,' 'aveng- 
ing forests,' 'milleniar torrents,' and 'the 
dusky corpulence of mountains,' to traverse 
' the delirium of Space ' and ' the supreme pla- 
teaux of an absurd Ideal,' to end finally in 
the grinding shock of a collision and all the 
agony of a shipwrecked vessel. ' ' One scarcely 
knows whether to breathe : Parvum in multo, 
or Quantum sufficit.

CLASSIC ARCHITECTURE IN 



National prominence and rapid artistic de- 
velopment are found concurrently in so many 
periods of history that it is wise at least to 
look for a blossoming of art wherever there has 
been notable success in other fields, like the 
political and economic. Hellas and Rome, 
Florence and Venice are the usual supports of 
such a view ; Spain after 1492, France in the 
Grand Siecle, and Germany in the last gen- 
eration tempt comparison. Not all of the arts 
necessarily, nor always a special one of them, 
have thus responded to contemporary circum- 
stances, but now sculpture, now architecture, 
now painting, now several arts at once. It is 
rare, indeed, if not unexampled, that a notable 
expansion in other fields has long failed to be 
accompanied by an escape from provincialism 
in the field of art. 

For English art during the period of British 
predominance fewer claims have been made

AND IRELAND IN THE EIGHTBENTH AND NINETEENTH CEN- 
TURIES. By A. E. Richardson. Illustrated in photogravure.

than the importance of the nation in politics, 
science, and literature might have suggested. 
The inherited lack of sympathy with actual 
participation in creative arts, the mutual de- 
crying of rival native schools, have prevented 
a full appreciation of the degree to which, half- 
unconsciously, England did develop a great 
art of her own, contemporary with the found- 
ing of British empire, and not unworthy of it 
in influence. 

The establishment of British imperial su- 
premacy, prepared by victories over the 
Spanish and the Dutch, was effected in the 
eighteenth century by the wars with France, 
culminating in 1759 at Plassey and Quebec. 
Wherever a final limit may yet be drawn, the 
century following may be taken as that of un- 
doubted and self-confident mastery. In other 
activities as well as in the political, it was dur- 
ing this general period that England played 
her most important role. The distinguished con- 
tributions of England to philosophy and to 
science, through Newton, Locke, and Berkeley, 
were made coincident with the first expansion 
toward empire ; the scholarship of Bentley and 
Gibbon, the epochal creation of the first novel- 
ists, fall in the middle eighteenth century. 

The empire was primarily the work of an 
aristocracy, which determined the direction of 
art until well into the nineteenth century, 
until the rising popular forces of industrialism 
and humanitarianism cost both aristocracy and 
classic art their supremacy. Its characteristic 
arts were those which ministered to luxury 
and family pride architecture and garden- 
ing, furniture and plate, in painting, portrai- 
ture. In some of these, we at once recognize, 
British art showed creative power of a high 
order. The furniture of the Adams antici- 
pated that of Louis XVI. and the Empire; 
the landscape garden, the jardin anglais, swept 
the continent like wild-fire. It is less appre- 
ciated that in architecture, also, England was 
first in developing a style destined to victory 
on the continent. The furious attacks of Rus- 
kin have blinded two generations against see- 
ing that in its classical architecture of the 
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries England 
has a great and a national art. 

The rehabilitation of the classical revival as 
a movement historically conditioned and thor- 
oughly vital in its day has been a work of the 
last few years it is still far from complete. 
Only in Germany is it understood that art can- 
not have died in 1800, or at any other date; 
in England and America we have at most tim- 
idly moved the end forward a decade or two. 
It is refreshing therefore to see a book like 
Mr. Richardson 's ' ' Monumental Classic Archi- 
tecture in Great Britain and Ireland during

the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries," 
which proceeds from the conviction that his 
subject-matter is one worthy of adequate pre- 
sentation and detailed study. In his handsome 
folio we have the first assemblage of large 
scale photographs and measured drawings of 
modern classic buildings in England. The 
selection is good, the presentation excellent. 

The purpose of the text is really hortatory, 
though it is cast in an historical form not the 
best adapted to such a purpose. The author 
wishes to urge the desirability of a return to 
monumental classic architecture in important 
buildings of the present. Under the historical 
method of presentation the buildings have 
mostly to speak for themselves, and very mon- 
umental and satisfying some of them are. 
Though unstarred in Baedeker, such superb 
compositions as the Lothbury Angle and the 
Lothbury Court of the Bank of England, such 
exquisite detail as in the organ loft at Green- 
wich Hospital, are worthy the attention of lay- 
men as well as of architects. What they teach 
in fact, however, is not that attempts in similar 
vein would be successful in the future, but 
that in the England of the eighteenth and 
early nineteenth centuries the classical move- 
ment was deeply rooted and produced magnifi- 
cent fruits. 

The eighteenth century saw a second dis- 
covery of antiquity so much surpassing the 
first in exactness of knowledge as to require a 
new purification of an architecture which ac- 
cepted without question the authority of the 
ancients. With all allowances for the work 
of other nations, the English must be accorded 
first place not only in the importance of their 
early studies in Greece, but in being the first 
to make application of the newly discovered 
forms in works of large scale. While France 
was deciding that there was no place for the 
literal reproduction of Greek forms in a mod- 
ern architecture, Stuart and Revett were beget- 
ting a generation to whom classic forms were 
truly their own. Whether a new classical re- 
vival in architecture can succeed to-day with- 
out the cultural foundations of the earlier ones, 
is the question now being argued pro and con 
by deeds on both sides of the Atlantic.

RECENT FICTION.* 



After all, a novelist needs more than any- 
thing else a knowledge of people. If he really 
has this knowledge even a little skill will 
enable him to go a long way toward appeasing 
that insatiable curiosity about what is going 
on in other people 's minds which intrigues us 
all. A novelist must have feeling, else he will 
arouse none in his readers. But was there 
ever a novelist of insight into human conduct 
who did not have feeling? The power to see 
and the capacity to react to the thing seen are 
so bound up together that it is difficult to imag- 
ine either existing by itself. The novelist 
without feeling is an anomaly. When he 
exists it is because novel-writing is a profes- 
sion as well as an art. He is a novelist for the 
same reason that he might have been a princi- 
pal of a high-school or an expert accountant. 
But the true novelist, even if he is a poor 
novelist, writes because his perception of the 
human scene is too keen to be contained within 
himself. He must share with others his con- 
viction, in Mr. Arnold Bennett's phrase, of 
' ' the interestingness of life. ' ' This perception 
and this conviction are one. It is out of 
knowledge about life that feeling about life 
is born. But there are many kinds and degrees 
of knowledge about life, even of knowledge of 
human beings; and some kinds (as well as, 
some degrees) are more interesting than 
others. The general rule is that knowledge of 
people is interesting in proportion as it is in- 
timate, personal, and concrete, and uninter- 
esting in proportion as it is detached, general, 
and abstract. Which is to say that a Herbert 
Spencer can never compete with a Charles 
Dickens. 

The Baroness von Suttner was a woman who 
saw clearly and felt deeply what war meant 
in the large. If she had seen it as clearly 
and felt it as deeply in the small, she might 
have written some of those pages in which 
Tolstoi gave us war. But her concern was not 
with the emotions of the individual; it was 
rather with the progress of the race. That is 
why this carefully written idealistic ' ' romance 
of the immediate future," which is called 
"When Thoughts Will Soar" in Mr. Dole's 
translation, contains so little that will inevi- 
tably engage the reader of fiction. Her last

novel, like her earlier ones, is bound to gain 
our respect ; but as her vision is too far from 
the immediate present, so her story is too far 
from immediate reality to capture our inter- 
est spontaneously. Her heroine, a feminist of 
the sort to whom an anti-feminist would be 
the last to object so impossible is it to find 
a flaw in her is only a device by which to 
point the way toward universal peace. She 
does not touch us. 

Mr. Opie Read, whose reputation as a teller 
of stories is wider than any he has ever made 
as a novelist, knows more about men and 
women than he chooses to tell us in " The New 
Mr. Howerson." His theme the regenera- 
tion of a man is one that has tempted most 
writers, and tempted them to vanity. Men 
are regenerated ; and there is perhaps no proc- 
ess about which we are more curious. But 
Mr. Bead is an incorrigible rhetorician, a man 
who can no more keep the flowers out of his 
speech than the humor out of his eye. He is 
at the mercy of his old habits, and so we read 
sentences like this : 

" Then he bought a watch, wondering as to who 
was now wearing a ticker of life's seconds once 
the timekeeper of his father's sermons, a proud 
possession, but long since entrusted to a stranger 
over whose door hung a bunch of enormous grapes, 
but only three in number." 

That is not a typical example, but it is per- 
haps an average one. There is a kindly wit 
on many a page, a wit that does not appear in 
the sentence quoted; and there is ineptitude 
also. Neither is a substitute for the facts, the 
solid human stuff which is the essential mate- 
rial of novels. 

An old nickname for Butte, Montana, fur- 
nishes the title for Mrs. Atherton 's new novel, 
"Perch of the Devil." The hero digs millions 
out of a mine; the heroine absorbs culture 
from a schoolteacher; the result is a happy 
adjustment of their warring natures. But be- 
fore Ida learned to wear her clothes one 
does not wear clothes passably: one wears 
them well or ill Gregory fell in love with 
Ora, who had been born to these things. Mrs. 
Atherton manages to convey an adequate 
notion of how Ida contrived to acquire the 
manners of the upper middle class they are 
not such elaborate manners that they cannot 
be acquired after maturity ! But the triangle 
is not so simple. Like a hundred other nov- 
elists, Mrs. Atherton has failed to do the im- 
possible. She has tried to make us believe that 
Gregory's love for Ora was a supreme passion, 
and that he was happy in giving it up. Her 
attempt is hardly to be respected, however re- 
spectable it may be. 

Mrs. Ghosal is a sister of Mr. Rabindranath 



Tagore. And though she has not his genius, 
she has some of his qualities. She knows what 
she has to tell, and she tells it with a simplic- 
ity and directness almost childlike. The story 
is a Hindu girl's account of her love, first for 
a man who proved untrustworthy, and then 
for another who proved worthy. She thought 
it a hopeless love because her father had 
already arranged a marriage for her in the 
Hindu fashion. Happily the man she loves 
and the man she is to marry prove to be the 
same person. The flavor of the narrative may 
be found in this passage, on the last page but 
one: 

" I thought at one time that individuality dis- 
appeared in love, and that love was all self-abne- 
gation, but now I find that as light and shade are 
both required for a landscape, so altercations and 
demands are also adjuncts of love, and in this way 
love is kept ever young. 

"At any rate in our lives love is full of chal- 
lenge. ' You do not love me,' I say mockingly, 
'you love the companion of your childhood.' 

" 'You do not love me,' is the inevitable reply. 
' You love the man you met at your sister's house, 
the doctor.' 

"And now I leave to the judgment of the reader 
to decide whom I have loved. Did I love the com- 
panion of my childhood and perceive the reflection 
of him in the doctor whom I met again as a man 
and a stranger, or did I love the man, and obtain 
the companion of my childhood by accident?" 

Dartmoor, which is generally regarded as a 
specialty of Mr. Eden Phillpotts 's, has for 
long been the chosen scene of another novelist, 
Mr. John Trevena. "Granite" is at least the 
sixth of his stories of this country. Mr. Tre- 
vena is what is called a stylist, but his novels 
are not dependent on their "literary" qual- 
ity. He is full of the lore of peasants. He 
knows their speech, their customs, and their 
bitter humor. But of course he is not himself 
a peasant, and like other men who write of a 
people among whom they do not properly be- 
long, he has always a tendency to make melo- 
drama of what he has seen but not truly lived. 
It would seem simple enough for a man who 
has lived alone in a cabin on Dartmoor for 
years to put the people he has known before 
us without the touch of false strangeness. But 
it is not. Mr. Trevena has tried, and tried as 
the artist must, but he has not altogether suc- 
ceeded. What he has accomplished is a piece 
of work that, were it about Brown County, 
Indiana, instead of Dartmoor, England, would 
be bound to interest many American readers. 

The first chapters of "The Lay Anthony" 
are surprisingly good. Mr. Hergesheimer has 
evidently taken great pains to select the pre- 
cise details which would suggest his young 
hero and the American town in which he lives. 
I thought as I read these pages that I had dis- 



1914]

covered a writer who knew American life and 
had both the courage and the skill to record it. 
But Mr. Hergesheimer is bound to move his 
readers at any cost. He is not satisfied with 
the stuff he has in his head ; he must dress it 
up with the stuff that he has found in yellow 
newspapers and in the speeches of romantic 
social workers. "The Lay Anthony" ends 
with one of the situations made so familiar by 
the "white slave" literature of the past two 
or three years. It is a pity, because Mr. Her- 
gesheimer undoubtedly knows a number of 
things that his readers would have been glad 
to learn, in place of this clap-trap.

characteristics sir Willoughby Maycock had his 
of Joseph book, ' ' With Mr. Chamberlain in 

the United States, 1887-88," all 
written and on the point of publication,when 
an unexpected and melancholy timeliness was 
given to it by the sudden death of the man 
whom he had so admiringly portrayed and 
whose name was to have appeared in a dedica- 
tion of the work. Mr. Chamberlain had 
"evinced great interest" in the book's prep- 
aration, and presumably its details, so far as 
they touch on his personal history and public 
services, are of that degree of accuracy which 
he himself would have desired. The author 
was assistant secretary to the special mission 
appointed by Great Britain in 1887 to confer 
with representatives of this country on the 
subject of the fisheries question, which had 
become a rather vexatious matter of dispute 
since the expiration in 1885 of the treaty 
defining the rights of each of the interested 
parties. Mr. Chamberlain was senior member 
of the British mission, and as such was re- 
ceived in this country with appropriate 
honors. It was his first visit, and one of its 
results, of the greatest interest to him, was 
the winning of an American wife in the person 
of Miss Mary E. Endicott, daughter of our 
then Secretary of "War. It will be readily 
conjectured that the visit as a whole, from 
November, 1887, to February, 1888, was suffi- 
ciently full of society events and travel inci- 
dents, including a brief sojourn in Canada, 
to furnish a readable volume of some size 
from the assistant secretary's pen. His nar- 
rative is considerably extended with press 
clippings pertinent to the matters in hand, 
and there are many illustrations, among which 
should be noted the author's own amateur 
efforts at pen-and-ink drawing, which give a 
welcome and amusing variety to the work. 
Not lacking, too, are the occasional betrayals 



of unfamiliarity with things American which 
we expect in a foreigner's account of his ex- 
periences in this country. But they are few. 
He calls one of our foremost educational insti- 
tutions "Princetown University," and his 
brief biographical sketch of James B. Angell, 
who served as one of the three United States 
representatives in the conference already re- 
ferred to, contains no mention of the Michigan 
University presidency so long held by Dr. 
Angell, though it does speak of his professor- 
ship at Brown University and his mission to 
China. Among the qualities noted in the 
character of the ' ' chief, ' ' as Mr. Chamberlain 
is occasionally called, the following is of in- 
terest: "He never lost an opportunity of 
devouring current literature, which interested 
him far more than conversation with dull 
people. I have never met anyone who could 
master the contents of a book so rapidly as 
Mr. Chamberlain. I remember his reading 
'Ben Hur,' which appeared about that time 
and was much talked of, in about a couple of 
hours, and I don't believe he skipped a line." 
The full text of the fisheries treaty, signed at 
Washington by the several commissioners 
February 15, 1888, is reproduced, with enough 
related matter to satisfy readers interested in 
the historical and diplomatic phase of the 
famous English statesman's first visit to our 
shores. The author has certainly allowed 
sufficient time to pass since then to enable him 
to give the event its proper perspective.

The classic account of the won- 
derful awakening of Portugal in 
the fifteenth century is the his- 
tory of that period by the late J. P. Oliveira 
Martins entitled "Os Filhos de D. Joao I." 
(The Sons of John L). This great study has 
recently appeared in an English translation, 
the joint product of James Johnston Abrams 
and William E. Reynolds. In order to give 
the work a title that has a definite meaning 
to English and American readers, the trans- 
lators have called it "The Golden Age of 
Prince Henry the Navigator" (Button). It is 
not to be inferred, however, that Prince Henry 
is the hero or even the leading character of the 
work : John I. had six sons, all of whom had 
important parts to play in Portuguese history, 
and the author traces the careers of all. If he 
finds a hero among them it is Peter the Trav- 
eller, for whose philosophic patience and gov- 
ernmental ideas the learned author shows 
much admiration. His picture of the great 
Prince Henry is decidedly unsympathetic : he 
describes him as a hard-hearted fanatic, ob- 
sessed with ideas of exploration and conquest

which finally led to the ruin of the father- 
land. It is Martins 's opinion that, although 
the Portuguese discoveries along the African 
coast and in the East Indies were of great 
value to Europe and to civilization, their 
benefit to Portugal was merely temporary. 
For imperial expansion and colonization Por- 
tugal, the author believes, had neither the 
necessary population nor the requisite mate- 
rial resources. As a result of the new ambi- 
tions the national strength was dissipated and 
a promising future failed. Prince Henry is 
also held responsible for the introduction of 
negro slavery into Portugal and the conse- 
quent introduction of Ethiopian blood into the 
Portuguese race. The author shows a strong 
bias against the aristocratic element in Portu- 
guese life and government, due, no doubt, to 
his political sympathies, which are those of a 
modern republican. Martins 's history posses- 
ses a rare interest ; it has great literary excel- 
lences, and the translation appears to have 
been prepared with much care. There seems 
to be no good reason, however, for retaining 
the Portuguese forms of proper names in a 
work that has such a positive popular appeal, 
especially since practically all such names have 
recognized English equivalents. Twelve at- 
tractive illustrations, chiefly pictures of his- 
toric places, add greatly to the value of the 
work. 



Uncalled-for 
attacks on 
Oscar Wilde. 



Lord Alfred Douglas rakes over 
an unsavory affair in his ' ' Oscar 
Wilde and Myself" (Duffield). 
His excuses for doing so are both pitiably and 
laughably inadequate. In the first place, he 
is on bad terms with some of Wilde's other 
friends and biographers who have accused 
him of exerting an evil influence over Wilde 
and spending Wilde's substance in riotous liv- 
ing, and have hinted at graver charges. In 
the second place, and this is his main motive, 
he wishes to forestall the damage that may be 
done to his fair fame by the possible publica- 
tion of large unprinted portions of Wilde's 
"De Profundis" in the year 1960 ! The manu- 
script is now deposited in the British Museum 
with the understanding that it is not to be 
published before that year; but certain parts 
of it were read in court in connection with a 
libel suit. Even if in 1960 the world is inter- 
ested in Oscar Wilde, the idea that in that 
year of grace anybody will be interested in 
Lord Alfred Douglas is sufficiently grotesque. 
But the futility of his present performance 
is heightened by the fact that he has been for- 
bidden by an injunction to quote the attacks 
which it is his chief purpose to answer. His 
book is the angry outcry of a man who feels 
abused. Of course it is unfair to Wilde; it 



probably errs almost as much on the side of 
depreciation as the biographies have erred on 
the side of praise. " It is always Judas, ' ' said 
Wilde, "who is the biographer"; but Judas 
may have something significant to say. In 
this case he has not very much. It is of no 
great interest to know that Lord Alfred Doug- 
las paid Wilde's bills; or that Wilde "was 
the biggest eater I ever knew"; or that 
in his last days he lost his "fine head for 
liquor." "He would rise from his seat and 
say, 'My dear fellow, I am sorry, but I per- 
ceive that I am drunk. ' ' These biographical 
details, however, are more interesting than 
Lord Alfred's attacks on Wilde's literary rep- 
utation. As to the second part of the title, 
Lord Alfred's portrait of himself is not en- 
gaging. Even if we accept all that he says in 
his own defence, he remains a pretty thorough- 
going snob, and a good deal of a cad. ' ' One 
can not," as he remarks, "be the son of the 
eighth Marquis of Queensberry nor a member 
of the family of Douglas without having the 
defects of one's qualities." It is a pity that 
one of these defects should be a desire to pub- 
lish the others. 

The exacts Unless a man has a compelling 
profession of love for the forester's life and 
the forester's work, let him give 
the profession a wide berth, is Mr. Gifford 
Pinchot's opening word of advice to readers 
of his succinct and excellent handbook, "The 
Training of a Forester" (Lippincott). Indis- 
putable is his assertion that "to the man whom 
it really suits, forestry offers a career more 
attractive, it may be said in all fairness, than 
any other career whatsoever"; but he states 
the fact as if it were not equally true of all, 
callings, from the clergyman's to the hang- 
man's. To Mr. Pinchot himself, as his book 
abundantly proves, the work of the Forester 
(invariably with a capital F) is the one work 
preeminently worth doing in the world, and 
it is the author's enthusiasm, backed by his 
thorough knowledge of his subject, that gives 
to his pages their readability and persuasive- 
ness. In sixteen brief chapters or sections he 
treats of the forest itself, the forest and the 
nation, the forester's professional equipment, 
his point of view, the personal qualities he 
should possess, the various branches of his 
work, national and state and private forestry, 
forestry schools, the forester's opportunity, 
and kindred subjects. Emphasis is laid on 
the necessity that the would-be successful for- 
ester have persistence and enthusiasm, the will 
to keep everlastingly at it, and the vision to 
realize the meaning and value of the results 
he is striving to attain. The obvious applica- 
bility of this principle to every worthy calling

in the range of human activity does not 
diminish its pertinency in the present instance. 
Young men with any inclination for the pro- 
fession so worthily represented by Mr. Pinchot 
should not fail to read his book. Eight illus- 
trations from photographs help to impart its 
lesson and enhance its attractiveness. 



Aeha terin ^ F> ^" ' Wellington's mono- 
ow-pubUc tn graph, "The Political and Sec- 

land history. ti(mal I n fl uence O f t fc e Public 

Lands, 1828-1842" (Houghton), constitutes a 
valuable addition to the literature of the pub- 
lic domain. While the intensive part of the 
book begins with the passage of the tariff of 
1828, a preliminary chapter gives a review of 
the period since 1820, so that the work con- 
nects with Professor Treat's volume upon 
' ' The National Land System, 1785-1820. ' ' In 
the body of his little book, Professor Welling- 
ton gives a minute analysis of the general 
legislation with regard to the public lands 
enacted or proposed in Congress, and shows 
the relation of the votes of parties upon this 
subject to the votes upon the tariff and inter- 
nal improvements, and to those upon the gen- 
eral financial policy of the United States. 
With truly commendable industry, Professor 
Wellington has traced the history of the many 
important land bills in their weary parliamen- 
tary course, and has carefully analyzed the 
votes by congressional districts and states. 
Through the latter study, he is able to present 
the sectional relation of the public land ques- 
tion, and to show how the East and the South 
tried to bargain with the West in regard to 
land measures, and how the presidential aspi- 
rants of the time were influenced by these 
sectional currents. The scope of the book is 
limited almost exclusively to these political 
bearings of the public land question. There 
is no attempt to discuss the deeper importance 
of the public lands, and little is said about the 
actual working of the land system in the states 
and territories; but what Professor Welling- 
ton undertook to do, he has accomplished with 
success. 

The title "Shakespeare's Coun- 
ftiner~arT earean try" in the "Highways and By- 
ways" series (Macmillan) be- 
comes very elastic, as treated by the Ven. 
W. H. Hutton. Of the four hundred and 
forty closely printed pages of the book, only 
about one-half have to do with the neigh- 
borhood of Stratford and Warwickshire in 
general. In the remainder, we are taken 
to regions somewhat afield regions of anti- 
quarian rather than literary interest. This 
will be regarded as a merit or a blemish, 
according to the taste of the individual 



reader. The author claims a forty years' 
acquaintance with the country; the "pleas- 
ant task" of writing the book was begun 
four years ago. But, sometimes a weight of 
knowledge may become a handicap to a 
writer; he finds it so hard to get far enough 
away from his authorities that his style and 
manner drag. The book is less readable than 
one would expect considering the special lit- 
erary and intrinsic picturesqueness of these 
regions; nevertheless, it may well be given a 
place on the reference shelf, or in the travel 
library of those specially interested in minute, 
antiquarian lore. The volume is copiously and 
beautifully illustrated by the drawings of 
Mr. Edmund H. New; a map at the end ena- 
bles the reader to follow with exactness the 
author's itinerary. 



We noted a year or two ago the 

Correspondence i n. 

of an American appearance ot the first volume 
of the Letters of Richard Henry 
Lee, edited by Dr. James Curtis Ballagh, of 
the University of Pennsylvania, and published 
by the Macmillan Co. under the auspices of 
the Society of the Colonial Dames of America. 
The work is now completed by a second vol- 
ume, of nearly six hundred pages, with a full 
index to the entire collection. As with most 
of the letter writers among our Revolutionary 
fathers, these pages make their appeal to the 
casual reader as well as to the seeker after 
the facts of history. The present volume 
covers fifteen years, from 1779 to 1794, the last 
letter bearing a date only three months pre- 
vious to Mr. Lee's death. Under present cir- 
cumstances we are glad to quote the following 
paragraph from this closing letter, directed to 
President Washington: 

" The success and happiness of the United States 
is our care, and if the nations of Europe approve 
war, we surely may be permitted to cultivate the 
arts of peace. And it is really a happiness to 
reflect that if war should befall us, our government 
will not promote it; but give cause to all who 
venerate humanity to revere the Rulers here." 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Four new volumes in Mr. John C. Van Dyke's 
series of " New Guides to Old Masters " (Scribner) 
are at hand. These are, respectively : " Munich, 
Frankfort and Cassel," grouped in one volume, 
" Berlin and Dresden " in another, " Vienna and 
Budapest" in another, and "Madrid" by itself. 
An interesting feature of these volumes, as of their 
predecessors, is that however much traditional 
attributions may be questioned, the assthetic value of 
each canvas is never ignored. "Venetian painting, 
quite good enough for Giorgione, and in spite of 
one's doubts, possibly by him." This kind of expo-

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16 



sition is precisely what the intelligent tourist needs 
a critical discussion of the work before which 
he stands, comparing it with other works by the 
same artist. 

Pierre Loti's memorable impressionistic work on 
the land of the Pharaohs appears in a new printing 
from the house of Duffield & Co., which first sent 
it forth to American readers early in 1910. Its 
English title, " Egypt," is far more appropriate 
than the French name ("La Mort de Philse") 
under which it appeared in the author's own coun- 
try. Mr. W. P. Baines is the competent translator, 
and Mr. A. Lamplough has supplied " eight illus- 
trations in colour " according to the announce- 
ment on the title-page; but the most diligent 
search fails to discover a single one of these art- 
products in the copy at hand. The propriety of 
the French title appears only in the closing chapter, 
on " The Passing of Philae." 

Leonardo da Vinci's anatomical papers (" Qua- 
derni d'Anatomia") in the Royal Library at 
Windsor have since 1911 been appearing in annual 
volumes under the editorship of three members of 
the University of Christiania (Ove C. L. Vangen- 
stein, M.A., A. Fonahn, M.D., and H. Hopstock, 
M.D.) and with the publisher's imprint of Jacob 
Dybwad, Christiania. Collotype reproductions of 
drawings and text, with English and German 
translations of the latter, render the work as nearly 
satisfactory in its completeness as it could well be 
made. The remaining volumes will appear, one at 
a time, in September of each year, until the under- 
taking is completed in six volumes. " Librarians, 
teachers of medical history, bibliophiles, artists, 
and those generally interested," are advised by the 
publisher to send in early orders for this work, 
which, as soon as two-thirds of the edition is sold, 
will be obtainable only at an advanced price, and 
which, the publisher predicts, will in a few years' 
time be rare if not unobtainable. 

The publication of the "Journal of the House of 
Burgesses of Virginia," by the Virginia State 
Library, is continued under the editorial super- 
vision of State Librarian H. R. Mcllwaine, with 
a volume containing records of the Assembly from 
1695 to 1702, a period of great importance in 
European and American history. The originals of 
these Journals are not known to be in existence 
and this publication is from transcripts made of 
copies in the English Public Record Office. As in 
former volumes, the editorial work is very carefully 
done. There is a good index by names and subjects 
and the membership roll of each session is carefully 
made up. During the years covered by this volume 
William III. of England was in the midst of his 
European wars, fighting as a champion of Prot- 
estantism. The conflict spread to America and 
resulted in the first general intercolonial war 
between the French and English colonists. The 
Proceedings of the Virginia burgesses reflect the 
activities of the time. There is much about the 
militia, the Indians, the navigation acts, salaries, 
taxes, and intercolonial matters. Like the former 
volumes, this one is valuable because it shows the 
development of an Anglo-American community 
from its beginnings. 



NOTES.

flower," is described as an " English society ro- 
mance " by her publishers, Hearst's International 
Library Co. 

Mr. Alexander Teixeira de Mattos has translated 
another of M. Fabre's delightful books, " The Wild 
Bee," which Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. announce 
for autumn publication. 

Professor Henry P. Johnston, of Yale, has made 
a new study of Nathan Hale, based partly on letters 
and journals recently discovered, which the Yale 
University Press will publish immediately. 

Mr. Upton Sinclair's new novel, " Sylvia's Mar- 
riage," is the second volume of a trilogy which 
began last year with " Sylvia." Messrs. John C. 
Winston Co. will publish the book at once. 

Mr. George Stevenson is a young English writer 
whose new novel, " Jenny Cartwright " has at- 
tracted favorable attention in the London weeklies. 
Mr. John Lane will publish the book on this side at 
once. 

The new novel by the author of " Elizabeth and 
Her German Garden," a book which particularly 
pleased Mr. H. G. Wells, is entitled " The Pastor's

lish it at once. 

Mr. Frank Harris's " Contemporary Portraits," 
which Mr. Mitchell Kennerley will publish in No- 
vember, records conversations with Swinburne, 
George Meredith, Robert Browning, Oscar Wilde, 
Whistler, Sir Richard Burton, Renan, Verlaine, and 
M. Anatole France. 

Mrs. Elsie Clews Parson's new book, " Fear and 
Conventionality," defines conventionality as that 
part of " man's system of protection against change 
which, with the lessening of his fear of change, he 
has begun to examine and even to forego." The 
book will be published shortly by Messrs. Putnam. 

" The New Republic," a weekly review of politics 
and the arts in which Mr. Herbert Croly and Mr. 
Walter Lippmann are interested, will appear 
shortly in New York. Mr. Croly is the author of 
" The Promise of American Life," a book which 
attracted much favorable attention two or three 
years ago. Mr. Lippmann wrote "A Preface to 
Politics," a book which was regarded as in some 
measure a repudiation of the socialism to which he 
for a time subscribed.

ANNOUNCEMENTS OF FALL BOOKS. 



It has been the custom of THE DIAL for 
many years past to place before its readers at 
this time a complete classified list of books 
announced for issue during the fall and winter 
season by the principal American publishers. 
These lists, carefully compiled for our pages 
from authentic information obtained especially 
for this purpose, have come to be accepted as 
a feature of the utmost interest and value 
to librarians, booksellers, and private book- 
buyers. The list for the present year, here- 
with presented, contains nearly two thousand 
titles, representing the output of about sixty 
publishers. Considerations of space make nec- 
essary the carrying over to our next issue of 
two departments ' ' School and College Text- 
Books ' ' and ' ' Books for the Young. ' ' Some 
of the more interesting features among these 
announcements are commented upon in the 
leading editorial in this issue of THE DIAL.

(From a Review in the ' Minneapolis Journal") 

Lincoln as He Was 

The Everyday Life of Abraham Lincoln. By Francis F. Browne. 
Browne & Howell Co., Publishers, Chicago. 

THE material for this work, which was originally published thirty years ago, 
was collected from more than five hundred of the friends and contemporaries 
of Lincoln. So much has been written on the subject during the last generation 
that any new issue in the field owes an apology for its existence. The manner in 
which the present volume was prepared constitutes a more than sufficient apology. 
Here an attempt has been made to present Lincoln, the man, rather than Lincoln, 
the tradition; and the result might be characterized as an anecdotal life. 

" It cannot be doubted that the traditional Lincoln, as usually presented to 
school children, and which has become fixed in the mind of the average adult, is 
a rather highly sentimentalized concept. All the tremendous and tragic circum- 
stances surrounding the man were admirably suited to act as a distorting medium. 
A long and exhausting war is conducive to popular hysteria, as a result of which 
even the most level-headed men are likely to overstate; and the tragic death would 
tend to stifle the colder, more detached criticism. Added to these circumstances 
was the powerful appeal to humanitarian idealism involved in the emancipation 
of slaves. 

" In the greater number of writings on Lincoln, one cannot but note an almost 
total lack of the sober critical faculty. All witnesses seem to have vied with 
each other in exaltation. Nearly all testimony has a suspicious note of emotional 
abandon in it. It will probably never be possible entirely to separate the tradi- 
tional from the factual; but that critical-minded historian of the future who shall 
write the fairest possible appraisal of Lincoln's character shall be obliged to make 
use of Mr. Browne's volume; and therein lies its chief value as a source. Nor 
need any American patriot fear the result of that colder criticism which is 
inevitable. The present volume, in which Lincoln is much less of a sad demi-god 
than in the conventional representations, shows how much greater a man may be 
in fact than in sentimental tradition. 

" Here is shown plainly, what has never been a secret and yet is persistently 
ignored, that Lincoln held out as long as possible against those who urged the 
abolition of slavery, issuing his proclamation only as a last desperate means of 
subduing the South. It was the master-stroke of a wise opportunist rather than 
the exalted deed of a humanitarian. And yet millions of children have been led 
to believe that the war was primarily a war against the institution of slavery, 
and that Lincoln's chief concern was with the freeing of slaves. Truly, he was 
opposed to slavery, but he constantly placed the preservation of the Union above 
abolition, believing that the latter should be accomplished by a slow process of 
purchase and colonization. That he thus proved his far-sightedness is apparent 
now when the negro question has become an issue of grave importance. There 
is much in the evidence here presented to indicate that, had he lived through the 
Eeconstruction period, the negro would have been dealt with in a much more prac- 
tical way than that of the high-handed ultra-humanitarians who insisted upon 
regarding the negro as an Anglo-Saxon with a black skin. 

" Furthermore, we here see Lincoln as a possible human being," capable of losing 
patience, capable of petulance and anger, capable of making mistakes. And 
inasmuch as he is made to appear more the man and less the demi-god, by so much 
he looms the bigger and is the more intelligible to men."

THE JOLLY BEGGARS: A CANTATA BY ROBERT 
BURNS WITH INTRODUCTION BY WILLIAM 
MARION REEDY 

It is time that what has been justly termed by all 
critics of the first rank the masterpiece of Burns should 
be seen in an edition with some pretension as to typo- 
graphical beauty. The essay on Some Aspects of Burns 
by Robert Louis Stevenson is also given entire. 

"Of all his poems perhaps the greatest certainly 
the most imaginative is 'The Jolly Beggars." The con- 
dition of the characters in this splendid 'Cantata' is in 
one respect akin to that in which the discoverer of the 
'Everlasting No' imagines that he might ultimately 
find himself. They have sounded to the bottom every 
possibility of disaster and humiliation; life can bring to 
them no evil of which they have not had the most inti- 
mate experience."

THE LAST CHRISTMAS TREE: AN IDYL OF 
IMMORTALITY BY JAMES LANE ALLEN 

A prose poem giving an impressionistic picture of 
human destiny as determined by the fate of the earth; 
an idyl of the evergreen and immortality of snow and 
death; a fairy tale of the last of the forest, in which two 
snow-burdened trees chant like harpers the life of man 
his advent in nature, his brief stay, his disappearance: 
with a requiem for his follies and faults and a resurgat 
for his virtues.

Songs of Nature and Life 



" ONE OF THE MOST SATISFYING OF 
RECENT COLLECTIONS OF VERSE' 



CPRINGFIELD REPUBLICAN: " The Golden Books 
are mostly old. Let us now and then acknowledge the 
gold minted in our own day." . . . '"Poems of Human Prog- 
ress,' besides being one of the largest, is one of the most satisfy- 
ing of recent collections of verse. There is a Wordsworthian 
purity of diction and love of Nature abounding in the many 
poems, especially the sonnets, that makes them delightful. 
One browses on from poem to poem full of optimistic cheer and 
lofty idealism, coming constantly on striking lines and a genuine 
depth of thought and feeling. There is not a poem in the 
book that is a mere experiment in metre or a group of felic- 
itously composed phrases ; beneath each piece of verse lies 
a definite thought. MT. West rises to his highest in his sonnets, 
of which there are more than 100. The virile love of Nature 
that permeates them distinctively turns the reader's thoughts 
to Wordsworth. In quoting from them one is perplexed at 
the abundance of good things, but the following must suffice 
as fair examples: [two sonnets are here quoted entire, "In 
Suburban Woods" and "By Dark or Light ]. The poems are 
marked throughout by an intensely human appeal, a discerning 
appreciation of the power of things simple and unaffected to 
develop the spirituality of humanity. A depressed and har- 
assed man could scarce find better reading to smooth the 
wrinkles out of his soul and give him a more roseate view 
of life." 

TJOOK NEWS MONTHLY (Philadelphia): "There is a 
surprise and a delight in store for him who looks into 
'Poems of Human Progress,' for therein is included much 
that is very real poetry indeed. Polished in style and powerful 
in substance, the poems make peculiar appeal to all that is 
aspirational in man. Mr. West's claim to attention is largely 
upon what Emerson has termed 'Man thinking'; yet it would 
be unfair to say that there are not also poems of purely lyric 
charm. 'Man's Triumph-Era' is a prophetic vision possessed 
of unusual merit. 'The Epic of Man' is a somewhat shorter 
poem with power to move the reader strongly. 'Heart of 



'THE PUBLIC (Chicago): "Scholarship with simple-heart- 
A edness, love of Nature serving love of man these are 
qualifications for a true democratic poet. A vision for man, 
seen with Nature-loving eyes, is embodied in 'Courage, O 
Workers !' Beautiful and expre'ssive lines are to be found 
everywhere through these pages. When such ease and strength 
of diction are combined with such accuracy of observation, 
such love of mankind, and such a sense of future good, the 
result is a poet who is worth while." 

PHRISTIAN REGISTER (Boston): "P9r high purpose, 

clear message, and poetic workmanship, should find 
accepted place among the best work of our American poets. 
... In his sonnets Mr. West has attained, at highest, a point 
not topped by any other of our accredited American poets, 
and here he may safely invite comparison with much of the 
best work of Wordsworth. The strongest and finest of his 
songs give him claim to very wide admiration. His verse 
displays a pleasing and effective variety of form notably 
excellent. Fine quotable lines are so frequent as to tempt to 
unrestrained extracts. More than one sonnet might fairly 
be called a chain of linked epigrams. The dominant note is 
an insistent ' forward ' call, an appeal for the simple, the natural, 
the human. The thought reflects cheerfulness, geniality, 
wealths of beauty, humane enthusiasm; bits of portraiture 
sometimes rugged, sometimes tender, always wonderfully 
sympathetic and vivid." 

PROP. EDWIN A. GROSVENOR, LL.D. (Dept. of Modern 
Government and International Law, Amherst College), 
President of United Chapters of Phi Beta Kappa: "In the 
Phi Beta Kappa poem, ' Man's Triumph-Era,' I find delight 
and inspiration. It is lofty in sentiment, intensely human in 
feeling, felicitous and virile in expression. Among the noble 

?oems wherewith the Phi Beta Kappa Muse has_ enriched us, 
know not one that in conception and execution surpasses 
this." 



Youth' and "The Bells of Como' are others that are 
representative and notably good. The book as a 
entitles its author to recognition in the ranks of the poets." 



fairly GAM WALTER FOSS, M.A., author and librarian: "Fine, 

representative and notably good. The book as a whole w strong, unconventional, full of original ideas, great 

stuff."

GREENWICH VILLAGE. 



Greenwich Village is the American parallel 
of the Latin Quarter. As everybody is sup- 
posed to know, Greenwich Village had once 
a separate existence of its own, outside the 
town of New York ; and its boundaries, when 
pointed out, are even now precise. One who 
lives on the north side of Fourteenth Street 
is technically not a resident of the Village, 
while one who lives on the south side is. But 
actually, of course, a member of Greenwich 
Village is a person of a sort and not too 
closely of a place: he is a Bohemian. Mr. 
Hutchins Hapgood has long been a true (per- 
haps the truest) villager, despite a legal 
residence up the Hudson. That "Playboy of 
the Editors' World," Mr. Jack Reed, pauses 
inevitably in the intervals of his journeys to 
the seats of war to enjoy, and to be enjoyed 
by, the group which affects Miss Polly Holli- 
day's restaurant, whether that happens to be 
in Provincetown, Massachusetts, or in Mac- 
dougal Street, just off Washington Square. 
Mr. Lincoln Steffens apparently finds quite 
as much of the intellectual refreshment his 
soul demands at the Liberal Club as at Mrs. 
Mabel Dodge's salon in Fifth Avenue, or in 
expounding Christianity to a state's attorney. 
On the other hand, Mr. Theodore Dreiser, 
who is hardly a Bohemian in any sense and 
who is probably happiest in the country, has 
his abode in a Greenwich Village flat-house. 
It would be a mistake to draw any very hard 
and fast lines, or to generalize freely about a 
group which may be held to include at the one 
extreme M. Hippolyte Havel, who washes 
dishes for Miss Holliday and refuses to write 
for any periodical but the "Anarchist Al- 
manack," and, at the other, Mr. Louis Unter- 
meyer, who designs jewelry for a factory in 
Jersey and writes for all the magazines in 
this country and a few in England. Never- 
theless, certain generalizations might be estab- 
lished, especially by those who perceive the 
similarities between Bohemians and under- 
graduates, between the communal spirit of 
Greenwich Village and if Greenwich Vil- 
lage will pardon our saying so that of Stan- 
ford, or Wisconsin, or Princeton* In the

[Oct. I 



Quarter, where students have been for gen- 
erations as much a part of the life as poets, 
they are lumped off together as a matter of 
long-established custom, and neither resents 
the implication. But in the Village, where 
"Bohemian" is almost an ineptitude and 
"Radical" is almost a title, there is a feeling 
that the college is one of those established 
institutions that require to be combated by 
the true children of progress and that of all 
classes undergraduates are the most con- 
temptibly and irremediably bourgeois. 

How different it seems to those of us who 
are neither of the college nor of the Village! 
Both institutions how abominable to speak 
of Greenwich Village as an institution ! are 
conscious attempts to create a little world 
apart, to found a convention less oppressive 
than that of middle-class society. The middle 
classes are so much more concerned about 
money than about art or scholarship, so much 
more eager for security than for revolution 
or for the rehabilitation of the past, so much 
more desirous of respectability than of easy 
social intercourse or of good-fellowship. Thus 
both the undergraduate and the Bohemian 
permit freedoms (in dress, in speech, in the 
manners of social intercourse) which are else- 
where frowned upon. And both of necessity 
enforce certain restrictions with a rigidity 
elsewhere unknown. In college it is obligatory 
to look administrative officers askance and to 
regard policemen without respect; in Green- 
wich Village it is editors and policemen. In 
both it is adaptability rather than achievement 
which is the test of personality. The fact that 
adaptability is usually required in the name 
of individuality only emphasizes the point. A 
person witholit those amiable vices of whose 
potency Stevenson once reminded us would 
be as far from comfortable at a studio party 
as in a fraternity house. 

There are some differences, it is true. The 
habit of cigarettes is not acceptable among 
' ' co-eds, ' ' at least not west of the Alleghenies ; 
whereas it is rather demanded of the young 
women of Greenwich Village. An interest in 
sport is expected of the undergraduate; it is 
regarded with amused tolerance by the Bo- 
hemian. But what is the essential difference 
between worshipping a captain of football 
and idealizing a Bill Haywood? The types 
which are conspicuous in college communities 
are so much like those we might identify in a 



rapid survey of Bohemia as to be interchange- 
able. 

In Greenwich Village there is a young man 
of less than thirty so unspoiled by ten years 
of sitting about cafe tables and gossiping 
about magazine offices, so pleasant of manner, 
so appreciative, so round-eyed, and so child- 
ishly sleepy that many of his younger con- 
freres speak of him affectionately by a 
diminutive; he could not be duplicated any- 
where, perhaps, but he is precisely the type 
which many a college class has known and 
loved and patronized, almost as much to his 
resentment as to his delight. There is another 
whose likeness to Oscar Wilde is already dis- 
tinguishable, though as yet insufficiently culti- 
vated; his patent sophistication, his passionate 
insincerity, his turn for paradox, his intel- 
lectual impertinence, his facility in icono- 
clastic exegesis is not he also quite as much 
of the college as of the Eighteen-Nineties in 
London and the Nineteen-IIundreds in New 
York? And there is a young woman, but 
enough of types. 

The very means of self-expression chosen 
by Greenwich Village is reminiscent of the 
college. A meeting of the formidable board 
which edits "The Masses" must be painfully 
like the meetings of those boards which edit 
"The Chaparral" at Stanford, or "The 
Sphinx" at Wisconsin, or "The Tiger" at 
Princeton. The editors of "The Masses" take 
themselves seriously, but not any more seri- 
ously than their undergraduate prototypes. 
And if the editor and the cartoonist of "The 
Masses" can boast of being haled into court 
at the instance of the Associated Press, there 
are sometime editors of "The Sphinx" who 
can point to an occasion when they were called 
before the discipline committee of the faculty 
of the University of Wisconsin. Nor is "The 
Masses" any more bitterly critical of the 
established order than are certain college 
magazines of a similar shape and a like fond- 
ness for the illustrated anecdote. 

All these outward and possibly trivial mani- 
festations of likeness between the undergrad- 
uate and the Bohemian community are but the 
sign of an inward identity. The strength of 
the college, and its weakness as well, lies in 
the very fact that it is a community banded 
together for mutual protection and mutual 
stimulation under a convention designed to 
establish kinship among its members. That 
is precisely the strength, and the weakness,

of Bohemia. Both are sanctuaries. Never to 
have known sanctuary is to have been un- 
fortunate. But always to have known sanctu- 
ary is never to have reached full stature. 
About every college are perpetual college men, 
adolescents whose development was arrested 
just as they were reaching manhood. And 
about Greenwich Village are perpetual Bo- 
hemians who have already paused for ten 
years in this most interesting, but incomplete, 
stage of their development. The best of the 
college we are speaking here of the college 
community to the exclusion of the instruc- 
tional program is delightful; but it is sel- 
dom bracing. The best of Bohemia is perhaps 
the pleasantest society in the world ; but it is 
seldom stimulating. The one offers play with- 
out responsibility; the other offers gossip 
without malice. Both of these are happy mani- 
festations of the human spirit, but neither is a 
substitute for the intellectual intercourse of 
equals. 

LITERATURE IN WAR AND PEACE. 



Perhaps it is bad taste for Americans, who 
are apparently set as spectators of the present 
tournament of nations, to speculate on the 
literary consequences of the world war. But 
after we have paid our tribute of horror and 
pity to what are probably the most appalling 
events of recorded history, our spirits must 
rise to the majesty of these occurrences; we 
must feel that they indicate or portend a 
great change in human thought. There 
seems to be too much hysteria in the cur- 
rent comment on the situation. For all the 
gloom there must be a corresponding glory. It 
is an old jest that newspapers publish columns 
and pages about a prize fight and then salve 
their conscience by editorials condemning the 
ring and all its ways. The public reads the 
stories and neglects the editorials and so it 
probably treats the war news and the preach- 
ments which accompany it. Like Dr. Brown's 
Rab, mankind "can just never get enough 
fighting." Like Budge in "Helen's Babies," 
it wants its heroes ' ' all bluggy. ' ' 

For ourselves we think that this combative 
instinct is the glory of our race. that it is a 
main force which keeps humanity from becom- 
ing dull, listless, enervated, and enslaved to 
sordid materiality. Ideal Love, Religion, and 
War are the three royal poetic strands in the 
web of life, and no one of them can be spared 
in the weaving. For a man to believe that 
there is something better or greater than him- 
self, whether it be a woman or his countrv or 



his God, that is the way out of the sty of the 
world. 

But such high considerations hardly ac- 
count for the popularity of the present wars. 
That they are popular seems unquestionable. 
None of the peoples concerned have had to be 
dragooned by their rulers or leaders into the 
fight. Perhaps the commercial era is at an 
end and a martial era is beginning. The com- 
mercial era has not been all beer and skittles. 
There is an uncommon amount of poverty and 
misery all over what we denominate the civ- 
ilized world, as is evidenced by the restlessness 
of the peoples, the vast socialistic agitations. 
Perhaps the dwellers in the slums, the workers 
in the factories, the men behind the plow, be- 
lieve that war will give them something, gain 
or glory, which they could not hope for in 
peace. It is at least an adventure which will 
lift them out of their dull lives. The fascina- 
tion of uniforms and arms, concerted move- 
ment, the march, the bivouac, the battle, is 
always strong. 

Anyhow, the dream of universal and per- 
petual peace may as well be banished. The 
world had something like such a peace when 
it lay at the foot of the Roman empire and 
the record is one of the worst pages in human 
history. We had better recognize that there 
will always be races or nations or groups of 
men or single conquerors who will strive for 
the headship of the world. In one of De 
Quincey's essays there is an Eastern apologue 
about peace which we may be pardoned for 
quoting. In an Asian city, he says, there is 
a block of polished granite several cubits in 
each dimension. It is protected by a temple, 
and, the legend goes, once in every hundred 
years an angel descends and just grazes the 
top of the block with its wing. When the 
granite shall be entirely worn away by this 
recurrent visiting, then, and not until then, 
shall peace reign in the world. Certainly it 
behooves us in America not to live in a Fool's 
Paradise, dreaming of an impossible peace. 
We are out of the current for the moment, 
but we do not know when it will eddy around 
us. The saying of the Greek sage to Croesus 
is hackneyed, but does not lose its pith. "0 
Croesus, when someone happens along who has 
better iron than you, he will have all this 
gold!" 

Things cannot be as they have been when 
this tornado which has burst over Europe has 
spent its force. Among other interests litera- 
ture will suffer a change. For one thing, we 
shall have a change of heroes. From the 
beginning of literature it has been dominated 
by the Man of the Sword. In Homer and 
Virgil, in the Bible and the great books of 



242 



THE DIAL 



[ Oct. 1 



the East, in the epics of the Middle Ages, in 
Shakespeare and on down to Scott, he has 
been the central figure. War and Poetry were 
one and indissoluble. But something like a 
hundred years ago their divorce was decreed. 
The delights of domesticity, the diversions of 
low life, began to be exclusively pictured. The 
average, unimportant person came into his 
own. The new, vast reading public wanted to 
see its own features in print; and authors 
who held to the exceptional and significant 
figures of the lords of humanity were as much 
out of fashion as ^Eschylus was in the age of 
Euripides. One evidence of the truth of all 
this is the cult of Jane Austen, the attempt 
made in recent years to claim for her the 
primacy of the English novel. Her clever 
miniatures of a perfectly insipid society are 
put forward as superior to the mighty master- 
pieces of Scott. Jane Austen lived in the time 
of the Napoleonic wars, but their greatness 
and heroisms and terrors have not the faintest 
reflection in her novels. In "Persuasion" a 
group of girls discuss "prize money" like so 
many white-throated sharks. Their only con- 
ception of war is that it might provide an 
establishment for one of them. 

But we have gone farther afield than the 
social world in our search for character types. 
We have plunged into the slums, the prisons, 
the lazarettos, in search of effective charac- 
ters. We have traded the king, the warrior, 
the thinker, for the village cretin or the city 
"tough." Criminals indeed are furnishing a 
large proportion of our book population, and 
with them the detective who follows on their 
trail. Judging by our novel literature, there 
"ain't no ten commandments" any more. It 
would be invidious in all this welter of story- 
writing, unredeemed by any gleam of nobility 
or high purpose or splendor of fate, to pick 
out instances. But there are two story series 
which have had a great run in America, that 
in which "Get Rich Quick Wallingford" 
figures and the "Potash and Perlmutter" set. 
They are undeniably clever and funny, but 
nobody seems to realize that they are horribly 
immoral and still more horribly vulgar. If 
war with its seriousness and terror will deliver 
us from such base conceptions of life as are 
voiced in such literary work, it will be worth 
its cost. 

If the present world war influences litera- 
ture as we think it will, it may possibly also 
deliver our novels and plays from female 
domination. For fifty years it has been the 
queen regnant. To take English literature 
alone, the two greatest modern novelists, Mere- 
dith and Hardy, have devoted their genius to 
depicting the intricacies of the feminine mind 



and character. To them man is merely an 
adjunct to woman. They have reversed the 
Biblical story of the rib. And a great line of 
popular writers Mrs. Ward, Mr. Hall Caine. 
Miss Marie Corelli, to name only a few have 
followed suit. Playwrights have given us the 
woman with a past, the woman who did, and 
all other varieties of assertive females. Woman 
is undoubtedly the most popular institution 
in the world, and we have no word to say 
against her glorification ; but we do not believe 
that her frail form and gentle mind is capable 
of holding the great passions and thoughts 
which need to be exhibited in a literary crea- 
tion of the first class. However, recent English 
literature has not been all feminine revela- 
tion. Stevenson kept alive the spirit of manly 
adventure. He had something of a boy's con- 
tempt for woman. "Tigers are proper, but 
girls are not proper," says Bevis in Richard 
Jefferies's excellent boys' story, and that was 
Stevenson's spirit. Mr. Kipling, Sir Rider 
Haggard, and Sir Conan Doyle (it seems a 
piece of irony that the greatest of these should 
lack the title) have done the most to keep up 
the fighting spirit of England. They have all 
been Cassandras warning their country of the 
evils of commercialism and bodying forth 
figures of the heroic mood. Mr. Wells seems 
to us to have been essentially unheroic. There 
is a note of fear, we think, in all his ingenious 
and interesting literary inventions. He seems 
to dread some great cataclysm coming upon 
mankind. We do not believe this dread is 
warranted. Man has always been equal to his 
fate, and has fearlessly confronted, if he has 
not controlled, the elements. So far as we can 
see, God never made anything greater than 
the human soul. Mr. Wells has believed that 
the progress of invention will finally do away 
with war that it will become too deadly. 
Now the deadliest weapon ever invented was 
the Roman short sword. In one of Caesar's 
battles four hundred thousand human beings 
were said to have been slain. If Mr. Wells is 
unheroic, Mr. Bernard -Shaw is anti-heroical. 
He has poured ridicule upon heroism such 
heroism as myriads of men of all classes are 
displaying to-day on the battlefields of Europe, 
Man does not live by bread alone. The 
commercial era through which we have been 
passing practically declared that he could 
and the result is the "Get Rich Quick Wal- 
lingfords" and the "Potashes and Perlmut- 
ters." We are not all going to be like that, 
Wars are largely protests of the human reason 
in favor of imagination and high spiritual 
things. They are generally worth the treasure 
and blood that is poured out in them. Would 
the North and South to-day resign the robe of

glory which the Civil War threw over them? 
Could half a century of dull material prog- 
ress equal the value of that war to us? We 
believe that the present unparalleled struggle 
will be equally beneficial; that it will clear 
the air like a great thunderstorm ; that it will 
energize human character ; and that especially 
it will revitalize literature which was becoming 
not only commonplace but common. 

CHARLES LEONARD MOORE. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



HISTORY IN THE MAKING, such as is now 
being written in blood over great areas of the 
European continent, has undeniably an in- 
tensity of interest not to be found in history 
ready-made and formally written out in the 
books. At the same time, both these kinds of 
history gain an increased significance when 
any striking parallelism can be traced be- 
tween them. A fortnight before the German 
forces operating in France had pushed their 
way almost to the gates of the French capital, 
Dr. G. Stanley Hall, who knows whereof he 
speaks by reason of his years of study and 
observation in Germany and his service as 
war correspondent in the Franco-Prussian 
conflict of 1870, is said to have declared that 
in two weeks the Kaiser's troops would reach 
Paris, and, further, that the German army 
would be found to be unconquerable. Pro- 
fessor Spenser Wilkinson, occupant of the 
chair of military history at Oxford, said in 
a recent printed utterance over his own name : 
"Thus Germany and Austria have declared 
in common that they will have their way in 
Europe, and that if it is not accepted they 
will impose it upon Europe by force. If they 
succeed the king of Prussia will be the over- 
lord of Europe. If Europe is to remain free 
the nations that Germany has challenged must 
defeat and disarm her and compel her to be 
content to till her own soil and mind her own 
business, not as a ruler of other nations, but 
as one among the united states of Europe." 
In view of the present manifest determina- 
tion of the German Kaiser to achieve his 
end at any cost, a determination that has 
already mustered into service nearly all the 
able-bodied men of the empire, the query may 
arise whether the world is to witness a repe- 
tition of the desperate measures employed a 
century and a half ago by Emperor William 's 
illustrious predecessor on the Prussian throne, 
Frederick the Great. In the fifth year of the 
Seven Years' War, beset by foes on the east 
and west in a manner not without its analogies 
to Germany's present situation, the outcome 



looked dubious enough for the indomitable 
Frederick. "But," says Macaulay in a pas- 
sage now meriting a re-reading, "the king 
carried on war as no European power has ever 
carried on war, except the Committee of Pub- 
lic Safety during the great agony of the 
French Revolution. He governed his kingdom 
as he would have governed a besieged town, 
not caring to what extent property was de- 
stroyed, or the pursuits of civil life suspended, 
so that he did but make head against the 
enemy. As long as there was a man left in 
Prussia, that man might carry a musket as 
long as there was a horse left, that horse 
might draw artillery. The coin was debased, 
the civil functionaries were left unpaid, in 
some provinces civil government altogether 
ceased to exist. But there were still rye-bread 
and potatoes, there were still lead and gun- 
powder; and, while the means of sustaining 
and destroying life remained, Frederick was 
determined to fight it out to the very last." 
Certainly the present situation is not without 
dire possibilities that give a very real meaning 
to such pages of history as that from which 
this quotation is made. 



THE CHARM OF THE PICARESQUE makes it- 
self felt in many works of literature beside 
those examples of fiction in which the picaro 
is avowedly the hero or at any rate the not 
least interesting character. The memoirs of 
Casanova, the autobiography of Benvenuto 
Cellini, the revelations of personal traits in 
the writings of George Borrow, the account 
of his erratic course of life left to us by that 
curious specimen of the amateur tramp. 
Josiah Flynt all these and many other sim- 
ilar writings attract by reason, in part at 
least, of their picaresque flavor or sugges- 
tion. Spanish dictionaries define the picaro 
as a rogue, a knave, a loafer not exactly 
complimentary terms, and yet as Mr. Locke so 
well demonstrates in his story of "The Be- 
loved Vagabond," it is at least theoretically 
possible to be all three and at the same time 
to command other feelings than those of re- 
pulsion and abhorrence. This well-nigh uni- 
versal appeal of the picaresque proves that we 
are almost all of us endowed with an element 
of the irresponsible vagabond, the light- 
hearted, empty-pocketed knight of the road 
that leads anywhither, the self-confident mas- 
ter of the day that now is and of the wits 
bestowed upon us at birth. Gil Bias outrages 
our sense of right a dozen times, but though 
we fling down the book in resentment, we pick 
it up again and go on, until at last the fas- 
cinating rogue outgrows his follies, settles 
down to a steady life, and the story neces- 



244

[ Oct. 1 



sarily comes to an end. Dr. Chisholm, in his 
varied and entertaining "Recreations of a 
Physician," one of the season's not least im- 
portant books, well says at the end of a chapter 
on the picaro in fiction: "Such feelings [of 
indignation or disapproval] are, however, 
evanescent. They yield quickly to the charm 
of the picaro, for this remarkable character 
possesses the strange faculty of retaining our 
respect amid all the devious vicissitudes of a 
dubious career. We feel that he has not be- 
come corrupted by misfortune and roguery, 
that his heart remains good. We are inclined 
to believe that Teresa would have made a much 
better daughter to Don Sancho de Mendoza 
than his own ; we recognize Gil Bias to be 
better than his masters, Dr. Sangrado, the 
Archbishop of Granada, the great Duke of 
Lerma ; Lazaro himself is superior to the men 
he serves. He asks for so little, some food, 
and a place where he may sleep quietly, and 
an occasional respite from the incessant blows 
of hostile fortune, that we cannot refuse 
him our sympathy. A mere waif, he makes 
an irresistible appeal to our hearts, and 
therein lies the secret of the success of the 
picaro in fiction ' ' and not seldom in real 
life as well. 



THE DECAY OF THE LECTURE as a means of 
imparting knowledge and communicating in- 
spiration has been ascribed largely to the 
rapid increase of printed books. The oral 
instruction of a Colet or Grocyn or Politian 
or Chalcondylas was sure of its eager hearers, 
whereas the modern university lecturer is too 
often listened to with languid indifference, 
the assumption being that the pith of his dis- 
course can be readily found in books and 
"crammed" on the eve of examination. A 
late utterance of the editor of "The Hibbert 
Journal" on the decline of the lecture calls 
attention to the ever-present need of this 
mode of instruction. From his timely re- 
marks, printed in the New York "Evening 
Post," some brief extracts are here not out of 
place. "Just because the range of modern 
knowledge is so vast, ' ' he says, ' ' just because 
the printed sources from which knowledge 
may be drawn are so multitudinous and con- 
fusing, there is need of some means by which 
the student can be placed at the living centre 
of his subject. This can be provided only by 
the living personality of a master, and to the 
end of time there will be no other way. . . . 
Endow a man with a whole library of well- 
written books, but leave him without an in- 
spiring personality at the centre of his subject, 
and the chances are a hundred to one that he 
will remain a dabbler." The importance of 



the lecturer's function Dr. Jacks not unnat- 
urally believes to be greatest in the depart- 
ment of philosophy, but he urges the revival 
of the art of lecturing in all fields of teaching 
and inquiry. "The very causes which have 
produced its decline clamor for its revival." 
Professor Robert MacDougall has recently (in 
"The Popular Science Monthly" for Septem- 
ber) protested against the excessive and debil- 
itating use of the pictorial accompaniment 
lantern slides and moving pictures in lec- 
tures of a supposedly educational character. 
"The mind is not taxed but appeased; the 
soi-disant teacher exerts himself to anticipate 
the moment of flagging attention, and out of 
an abundant store to supply it at each turn 
with a novel and pleasurable stimulus." 
Neither the popular entertainer nor the de- 
liverer of perfunctory oral discourse to sleepy 
students is the true lecturer as conceived by 
Professor Jacks and Professor MacDougall. 



A ROYAL POET, far more truly an artist and 
an idealist, if one may credit the assertions of 
his present-day French admirers, than was 
the first of the English Stuarts or the re- 
nowned great-grandson of the Great Elector 
of Brandenburg, is the little-understood ruler 
of all the Russias. The Paris newspaper press 
is naturally at this time markedly cordial 
and sympathetic in its attitude toward the 
Romanoff sovereign at St. Petersburg we 
beg his pardon, at Petrograd ; and from such 
organs of public opinion as the "Figaro" and 
the "Gaulois" a credulous reader would gain 
the impression that the Czar is one of the most 
artistically gifted, romantically melancholy, 
cruelly unappreciated, and altogether Hamlet- 
like princes ever stretched on the rack of this 
tough world. So fine are said to be his sesthetic 
sensibilities that he will not tolerate in his 
domestic environment any work of art in the 
least discordant with his tastes. His chosen 
authors are stylists, masters of an irreproach- 
able manner and the farthest possible remove 
from those crudities and barbarisms that make 
the volcanic Gorky a torture to his gentle soul. 
Poems from his pen, but necessarily under an 
assumed name, circulate among his intimates 
in limited editions privately printed and jeal- 
ously guarded from an undesired publicity. 
His muse is melancholy, and this pensiveness 
shows itself also in the music he favors and in 
the school of painting that elicits his appro- 
bation. He talks poetry and art, we are told, 
with a quiet appreciation and a w r istful smile 
that make it all but impossible to see in this 
modest, deferential, ingratiating gentleman of 
refined and cultivated tastes the autocratic 
head of the Russian Empire. All this is really

THE DIAL 



delightful, if true ; and it is more than a little 
puzzling also, but not the first puzzle of the 
sort in the world's history. Marcus Aurelius, 
involved in almost continuous warfare, and 
held responsible for the pitiless persecution 
that the Christians suffered in his reign, was 
nevertheless the author of the famous ' ' Medi- 
tations" which have solaced and strengthened 
so many thousands of readers, and was in his 
own person a most worthy example of all that 
is best in the Stoic philosophy inculcated by 
his writings. 



CULTURE AND CONQUEST, in their inter-rela- 
tions, were made the subject of some observa- 
tions from the pen of Friedrich Nietzsche 
when he was holding a Basel professorship at 
the close of the Franco-Prussian War. "In- 
opportune Considerations" he entitled the 
series of four essays then written by him, and 
from one of them a correspondent of the New 
York "Evening Post" now quotes certain not 
inopportune passages, as for example : ' ' Cul- 
ture is, above all, unity of artistic style in all 
the activities of a people. But to know and 
to have learned much is neither a necessary 
means of culture nor a mark of it, and if need 
be agrees excellently with the opposite of 
culture, barbarism, that is, absence of style, 
or the chaotic mix-up of all styles." And, he 
continues, it is precisely this chaotic mix-up 
that characterizes so-called German culture. 
"Even if we had really ceased to copy them 
[the French], we should not thereby have 
prevailed over them, but should merely have 
freed ourselves from them ; only after we had 
forced an original German culture upon them 
could there be any talk of a triumph of Ger- 
man culture. In the meantime let us bear in 
mind that we still depend upon Paris in all 
matters of form, and that we must so depend ; 
for so far there is no German original culture. 
We all ought to know this of ourselves ; more- 
over, one of the few who have the right to tell 
the Germans so in a tone of reproach, has 
openly disclosed it. 'We Germans are of yes- 
terday,' Goethe once said to Eckermami; 'to 
be sure, for a century we have cultivated our- 
selves quite diligently, but a couple of cen- 
turies may yet pass before so much intellectu- 
ality and higher culture shall have penetrated 
our people and become universal that one will 
be able to say of them : It is a long time since 
they were barbarians.' ' As history has re- 
peatedly shown, the culture of the conquered 
is all but invincible. 



THE OFFICE OF FICTION-TASTER, as it exists 
in the Boston system of selecting novels for 
the public library, has its agreeable and also 



its disagreeable features. As in olden times 
the taster of dishes for the king's table was 
exposed to the risk of an occasional mouthful 
of poison, so the person who consents to stand 
between the public and the injurious books 
pressing for admission to the public library 
may now and then inadvertently swallow a 
morsel of ill-flavored literature. Much fun 
has been made of the supposed committee of 
prudish old maids who kept the fiction list of 
the Boston Public Library up to its high 
standard of moral purity, but in an age when 
novels multiply so rapidly as at present 
almost any severely restrictive system of pur- 
chase is better than indiscriminate inclusive- 
ness. As to the practical workings of the 
Boston method, the Examining Committee of 
the library has this to say of it in its latest 
report: "The process of dealing with works 
of fiction, with the help of a Reading Com- 
mittee made up of men and women of widely 
various interests and tastes, serves well the 
purpose of selecting the comparatively small 
number of novels and collected short stories 
which are purchased under the Library's sys- 
tem of limited supply in this field of literature. 
This system appears to be based upon a wise 
policy, not only in the service of the public, 
but also in the expenditure of the Library 
funds. Since the accession of a single novel 
means the purchase of twenty or more copies 
- to supply all the shelves, in different parts 
of the city, on which it must be placed the 
limiting of purchase is imperative. A Read- 
ing Committee, made up of representatives of 
diverse races and religions, and acting merely 
in an advisory capacity, is well calculated to 
give the Trustees the help they need. We do 
not find that any racial or religious influence 
is predominant in the working of this plan. ' ' 



PROFESSORIAL LIABILITY TO IMPOSITION, the 
high-minded scholar's unsuspecting attitude 
toward the selfish designs of the less high- 
minded, is so familiar to the world both as a 
favorite theme in fiction and as a frequent 
subject for remark in daily life, that novelty 
can hardly be claimed for any illustrations 
that may by chance from time to time come 
to one's notice. Professor C. Hanford Hen- 
derson, in his latest book, "What Is It to Be 
Educated?" calls attention in his closing 
pages to certain excessive charges imposed, 
not upon idealists and dreamers alone, it is 
true, but upon few that are less able, pecuni- 
arily, to bear them. He speaks incidentally of 
having in his own person been the victim, or 
the -intended victim, of unscrupulous medical 
practice. "I have had a physician lie to me," 
he relates, "in order to bring me unnecessarily

to his office a second time. I have had one 
charge me the regular fee for telling me that 
he could do nothing for me and that I must 
consult some one else. . . . Surgery seems par- 
ticularly rapacious. I have known a profes- 
sor's family to lose its summer vacation 
because one of the children developed appen- 
dicitis, and for that very simple operation, a 
removal of the appendix, was charged a thou- 
sand dollars. I have known a wholesome Har- 
vard boy to get into the hands of a Boston 
dentist, and to be carried along, week after 
week, unnecessarily, until the bill amounted 
to one quarter of the boy's yearly income, a 
double theft of time and money." He takes 
occasion to remark that "that accusing docu- 
ment, the preface to 'A Doctor's Dilemma,' 
has never been successfully answered. ' ' After 
all, even the sorest victim of chicanery may 
comfort himself with the reflection that the 
impostor is sure in the end to discover that he 
has cheated himself. 



WHAT THE PEOPLE ARE READING at present 
would seem to be chiefly the newspaper bulle- 
tin boards and the war extras issued with 
lavish prodigality by the newspaper pub- 
lishers. Several of the London daily journals 
that ordinarily extend to twelve and sixteen 
pages of miscellaneous news now appear in 
editions of eight pages devoted chiefly to con- 
flicting rumors and meagre censored dis- 
patches from the seat of war. Few readers 
care for anything but war news, the people 
can think of but one thing at a time, and even 
the American baseball enthusiast follows with 
languid interest the unsanguinary combat of 
the diamond while so much fiercer a struggle 
is holding the world in breathless suspense. 
Even the advertising pages of our journals 
show the temper of the times. English cloth- 
iers call attention to their "Active Service 
Kits," steamship lines have greatly modified 
or curtailed their solicitations of ocean traffic, 
the announcements of church services are not 
free from reference to the all-absorbing theme, 
and in the book-advertising section of one's 
newspaper such literary wares as Mr. W. 
Douglas Newton's story entitled "War" (de- 
scribing "the progress of an invading army 
through a country" and telling "with the cold 
accuracy of a camera just what happens as 
the army advances") are brought conspic- 
uously into notice. We may deplore this ab- 
sorption of attention in so gruesome a theme, 
and the closet philosopher may urge a course 
of reading in the "Meditations" of Marcus 
Aurelius and the "Enchiridion" of Epictetus 
as a corrective; but no radical cure of our 
present distemper is possible until the malady 



has run its course. The patient must get a 
good deal worse before he can begin to get a 

little better. 



THE LIBRARY EDITOR is a comparatively new 
official on the public library staff, and his 
duties are not yet matter of common knowl- 
edge. Such a library as that of New York, 
for example, issues a variety of publications, 
chiefly bibliographical, and the supervision of 
their preparation and issue takes time and 
thought and special knowledge. This post in 
that institution has lately, it is announced, 
been offered to and accepted by Mr. Edmund 
Lester Pearson, whose editing of "The Old 
Librarian's Almanack" was the enlivenment 
(and the bewilderment, not to say the befool- 
ment) of the library world a few years ago. 
From the Cleveland Public Library's current 
Report we learn that a library editor has 
lately been appointed there, his, or her, duties 
embracing "several related forms of work: 
the editing of library publications, annotation, 
the duties of staff secretary, and a share in 
the publicity work of the library." The ex- 
cellent ' ' Open Shelf, " a briefly but judiciously 
annotated monthly book-list, is prepared by 
the library editor, and other annotated lists 
on special topics are also the work of her 
hand. Last year she enlarged her sphere of 
usefulness by giving a course of ten lectures 
on the principles of book selection to the 
apprentice class, and two lectures, on "Trans- 
lations of Foreign Literature" and "Library 
Printing," to the Western Reserve Library 

School. 



THE PROGRESS OF Ro, the universal language 
invented by Mr. Edward P. Foster of Mari- 
etta, Ohio, and described by him as "an a 
priori language, based on the analysis and 
classification of ideas," continues in spite of 
the clash of nations and the crumbling of 
kingdoms. "World-Speech," the monthly 
publication by which Mr. Foster spreads the 
knowledge of his proposed medium for cos- 
mopolitan intercourse, has reached its twenty- 
first number, and in this number is printed a 
list of fifty-three short and presumably useful 
sentences, in four languages, Ro, English, 
French, and German. For instance, what 
could be more serviceable, in certain easily 
conceivable circumstances, than a universal 
form for the following idea: "I love you. 
Will you marry me?" An emergency might 
arise, too, requiring a universally intelligible 
expression of the fact that "cats kill some 
birds, but not ostriches or eagles," or that 
"the father of the boy bought him a horse 
yesterday. ' '

THE STORY OF A MAGAZINE AND 
ITS FOUXDEK.* 



So consuming a passion for accomplishing 
difficult undertakings, so extraordinary a ca- 
pacity for hard, grinding toil, so remarkable 
a power for enduring the hardships and priva- 
tions incident to penury, have rarely been pic- 
tured in autobiography as they are presented 
in Mr. S. S. McClure's account of the struggles 
of his boyhood, youth, and early manhood in 
achieving his ambition to get an education and, 
after that, to carry to success his ventures in 
the field of publishing. Bora in Ireland, of 
Scottish and Huguenot ancestry, the future 
founder of the popular magazine bearing his 
name received as his most valuable inheritance 
a sturdy constitution and a self-reliance that 
made him the master of any situation in which 
he was likely to find himself. To the mother 
we naturally look for some of the traits that 
distinguish the son, and we do not look in vain. 
The opening chapter of ' ' My Autobiography ' ' 
contains this passage descriptive of Elizabeth 
Gaston McClure : 

" My mother was a girl of unusual physical 
vigor and great energy, and had always done farm- 
work. She was able to do a man's work and a 
woman's work at the same time. After keeping 
up with the men in the fields all day, she would 
come in and get supper for them at night. After 
her marriage she continued to work on her father's 
farm, and my father continued as one of my 
grandfather McClure's workmen. It was in my 
grandfather Gaston's house at the Frocess that I, 
the first child of this marriage, was born." 

The father's early death, the mother's emi- 
gration with her four boys to America, their 
desperate struggle for existence in Indiana, the 
eldest son's many and varied industrial efforts 
and at least partial successes, the kindling of 
his ambition to become an educated man, his 
heroic storming of the outworks of Knox Col- 
lege with fifteen cents in his pocket and limit- 
less courage in his breast, the means he resorted 
to in order to keep soul and body together dur- 
ing his seven years of preparatory and college 
study, his seven-years engagement to the 
daughter of a Knox professor who frowned on 
the penniless student's suit for her hand, and 
his ultimate success in this as in other cherished 
plans, are all related in the uncircumlocutory 
style natural to one more given to the doing 
of deeds than to their rhetorical embellishment. 
Yet there were certain tasks so unsuited to this 
eager youth 's temperament that, after under- 
taking them, he felt the hopelessness of con-

trations. New York : Frederick A. Stokes Co. 



tinuing the struggle, and ran away from his 
job, as he expresses it. One of these uncon- 
genial labors was school-teaching; the hum- 
drum of it he could not endure, and though 
he thrice tried to hold himself down to the dull 
agony of the country school, he abandoned the 
attempt each time before the term was ended. 
Rather than fill the part of pedagogue he 
would endure such rigors of impecuniosity as 
are pictured in the following passage from his 
life at Galesburg : 

" Nearly every night the pail of water in my 
room used to freeze solid and swell up in the 
center. I had a fur cap by this time, and I used 
always to eat my meals walking up and down the 
room, with my cap and woolen mittens on. I 
seldom had anything to eat but bread, and it froze 
so hard that it was full of ice and hard to chew. 
I cannot remember anything more dismal than those 
meals in that terribly cold room. A very poor 
divinity student roomed with me for a few weeks 
a solemn, pious fellow with protruding teeth; and 
I remember, one Sunday when we came home from 
church and had nothing but cold corn-meal mush 
for our Sunday dinner, he varied his usual blessing 
as we confronted the dish, and said : ' Lord, 
bless, we pray thee, this miserable food to our 
perishing bodies.' Going to bed, however, was the 
greatest hardship. The sheets were so cold, and 
had been cold for so long, that getting into bed was 
like plunging naked into a snow-drift. At night 
I usually studied in the public jibrary, or in the 
office of the hotel, or in the waiting-room of the 
depot, where there was always a red-hot stove." 

Mind triumphed over body to such an extent 
that the young student, as he tells us, got so 
that he could go to bed supperless without 
feeling any great discomfort; and he might 
even have carried this experiment in cheap 
living so far as to establish the fact that, in 
an academic atmosphere and with congenial 
studies to stimulate the intellect, starvation 
itself is not a disagreeable experience, had not 
his aspect betrayed the critical condition of 
affairs in that comfortless dormitory and 
caused his removal to the house of some good 
people who soon restored him to physical vigor. 

Initiation into the mysteries of printing had 
come to Mr. McClure when he was attending 
school at Valparaiso, Indiana, where he served 
for two months as printer's devil on "The 
Vidette, ' ' a newspaper published there. Type- 
setting and the making-up of the paper were 
quickly learned by the versatile lad, and there- 
fore he was not ill fitted for the work that came 
to him later in college, when the editorship of 
"The Knox College Student" fell to his lot. 
Of this work he writes : 

" In editing the Knox Student I followed ex- 
actly the same principles of editing- that I after- 
ward followed in editing McClure's Magazine. 
Whatever I know about editing I knew in the

beginning. We had, after the manner of college 
papers, a long staff of contributing editors, an 
Exchange Editor, a Society Editor, etc. I remem- 
ber that at first some of them were very indignant 
at the way in which I cut and modified their copy. 
There was especial indignation because I cut all 
such items as : ' Charley Brown was seen walking 
across the campus with a vision in white last 
Friday afternoon. What about it, Charley?' 
Phillips and I had undertaken to make the paper 
lively and interesting, and we did n't consider this 
form of humor either one or the other." 

The Phillips here mentioned was, like his 
friend and co-worker, destined for greater 
things in the publishing world beyond the col- 
lege gates. He is at present editor of "The 
American Magazine." Mr. McClure himself 
became editor of ' ' The Wheelman ' ' and gained 
a further acquaintance with the making of 
printed matter in the DeVinne printing house 
before he entered on his chosen work of syndi- 
cate publication and, later, the building up 
of a popular monthly magazine. The strug- 
gles of the syndicate to win a footing make 
an absorbing story, as do the early fortunes 
and misfortunes of the magazine. ' ' I launched 
the syndicate, ' ' writes Mr. McClure, ' ' Novem- 
ber 16, 1884. The first thing I syndicated was 
a two-part story by H. H. Boyesen. I had 
agreed to pay Boyesen $250 for it, and 
although some newspapers in large cities paid 
as high as $20 "for the right to print it, my 
returns on the story aggregated $50 less than 
the story cost me." This was a serious situa- 
tion for the adventurous young man, as he was 
not only without funds for current expenses, 
but he was saddled with a considerable debt. 
The story of the hazardous but ultimately very 
successful enterprise continues : 

" I went down to the Century office and bor- 
rowed $5 from a young man I had worked with 
there it must be remembered that I knew almost 
no one in New York and with this $5 I went to 
Philadelphia. There I sold two stories, the one by 
Boyesen and another by ' J. S. of Dale,' for $45 to 
Philadelphia papers. I borrowed some money 
from a relative there, and went on to Washington, 
where I also sold my stories, then home. As soon 
as I got back to New York, I went to Boston. 
There Mr. Rowland, of Outing, got me a pass to 
Albany. ... At Albany I sold the service for $5 
a week. When I got back to New York I found 
letters from several important newspapers, such 
as the St. Paul Pioneer Press and the San Fran- 
cisco Argonaut which I had written to but had 
not heard from before agreeing to take the 
service at $8 a week. Then I realized that I was 
started. I paid Boyesen part of what I owed him, 
and lived on the rest, paying him a little more, as 
I could. Week after week and month after month 
I fell short in this way, and got deeper and deeper 
into debt. I got along by paying my authors $10 
or $20 on account. I paid out a little less than I 



collected, and my actual working capital was the 
money I owed authors. I made no secret of this, 
and the men who wrote for me were usually 
willing to wait for their money, as they realized 
that my syndicate was a new source of revenue 
which might eventually become very profitable to 
them. And it did." 

Similarly the history of the magazine that was 
started on no capital and infinite courage 
in 1893 is full of hairbreadth escapes from 
disastrous failure and long periods of sta- 
tionary or declining fortunes, followed at last 
by glorious success. Faith and persistence 
seem to have served admirably in place of cap- 
ital, and it must have required a very firm 
faith as well as considerable credit to carry on 
an enterprise that was losing four thousand 
dollars a month, which was the average deficit 
of the magazine in its third year. But two 
years later it showed a profit of five thousand 
dollars for each issue, and its standing was 
thenceforth secure. Here is a glimpse of the 
heart-breaking struggle that preceded that 
assured prosperity: 

" During the first summer of the magazine's ex- 
istence, in the panic year of '93, I was staying 
with Professor Henry Drummond at Northfield, 
where he was visiting Moody's school. We took 
long walks together; and one day, when we were 
off in the country, sitting on the grass, I told 
Drummond that I did not see how I could possibly 
put through the task I had undertaken that I 
did not feel strong enough to do it, and that I 
always seemed to be undertaking more than I could 
do. I have never forgotten his reply. He said: 
' Unless a man undertakes to do more than he 
possibly can, he will never do all that he can.' " 

One reason for the early success of " Mc- 
Clure 's Magazine" is expressed in the words 
of Mr. Kipling to its editor: "It takes the 
young man to find the young man." Mr. Mc- 
Clure was young and on the look-out for new 
talent, and so the new talent came inevitably 
his way. The list of gifted young authors he 
discovered or helped to discover is a long one 
and includes such names as Robert Louis Ste- 
venson, Sir A. Conan Doyle, and Mr. Kipling. 
A later element in the magazine's prosperity 
has been its editor's alertness to the temper 
of the times in matters of social and govern- 
mental reform, and his system for giving these 
public questions the most thorough and intel- 
ligent treatment in articles written by experts 
in the popular presentation of timely and 
important topics. 

The author of "My Autobiography" shows 
himself to be, as he frankly confesses himself 
to be, a man of one set of interests. His busi- 
ness and his pleasure are one ; his vocation is 
his avocation; his daily task is his daily rec- 
reation. Thus his book is the story of his work

in the great new world to which he came as a 
boy with eager expectancy, and it is little else. 
But this is not said in depreciation. Unity is 
a quality of art, and the simple sincerity and 
singleness of purpose shown in the narrative 
will not count against it. Incidental glimpses 
are furnished, too, of the wide range of lit- 
erary workers with whom the author's search 
for new writers has brought him into more or 
less friendly relationship. Portraits of many 
of these are reproduced, with other appropriate

THE APOSTLE OF EUGENICS.* 



Thirty years ago, in England, the present 
writer had the good fortune to read Galton J s 
"Human Faculty," then almost a new book. 
It is impossible to forget the impression made 
by its originality, suggestiveness, and applica- 
tion of scientific methods to the study of every- 
day experiences. Vague questionings of the 
human mind, stimulated in the first instance, 
possibly, by the works of Poe, here found at 
least partial answers; while it seemed that a 
great new field lay open for fruitful investi- 
gation. At the same time, little as the author 
may have intended it, metaphysical specula- 
tion was encouraged. The greater territory 
annexed by science had of course greater 
boundaries, and many headlands jutting into 
the sea of the unknown, from which it was 
easy to make metaphysical excursions. Now, 
after the lapse of years, bringing a much bet- 
ter knowledge of Galton and his works, the 
old impression still remains. The subtleties 
of modern psychology, the revelations of twen- 
tieth century experimenters, have in a sense 
rendered Galton 's writings obsolete. Neverthe- 
less, they may be read with advantage, not 
only for their significant statements of fact, 
but principally perhaps as examples of bold- 
ness combined with sagacity, almost naive 
originality cheeked by continual appeals to 
experience. The eugenics movement, of which 
we hear so much to-day, is primarily due to 
Galton ; and while the control of human hered- 
ity may not altogether follow the lines he sug- 
gested, it will always be recognized that he 
first won public consideration for the subject. 
When he died in 1911, at the age of eighty -nine, 
he left funds for the support of a professor- 
ship and laboratory in the University of Lon- 
don, dedicated to the cause of eugenics and 
the study of human heredity. 

* THE LIFE, LETTERS, AND LABOURS OP FRANCIS GALTON. 
By Karl Pearson. Volume I. Illustrated. New York: 
G. P. Putnam's Sons. 



The Galton Professor, Dr. Karl Pearson, 
has considered it his duty and his pleasure to 
prepare an elaborate work on the life of Sir 
Francis Galton, giving all significant details 
obtainable concerning his ancestry and en- 
vironment. The first volume, covering the 
years from birth to marriage (1853) is now 
before us. In 1909, Galton himself published 
a charming and interesting book, "Memories 
of My Life," which sufficiently described the 
main facts of his career. The new work is far 
more detailed, and very profusely illustrated. 
It gives full particulars concerning the Gal- 
tons and their ancestors, and also much about 
the Darwin family, Francis Galton and 
Charles Darwin both being grandsons of Eras- 
mus Darwin. Professor Pearson, in his pref- 
ace, disarms the critic by the following frank 
remarks : 

" I am fully aware that the indolent reader will 
find much in this work which he does not want 
and which has but little interest for him. It is 
intended fundamentally as a permanent memorial 
to the Founder of the Galton Laboratory, and em- 
braces material which may easily perish or be 
ultimately lost sight of. If the said reader will 
only wait a few years, I have little doubt that my 
material will be strained of its more solid content 
and presented to him in that light and cheap form, 
which we are told is a first necessity of the modern 
book market. My object is a different one, namely, 
to issue a volume to some extent worthy of the 
name of the man it bears, which may be studied 
hereafter by those who wish to understand him, 
his origin and his aims, rather than to furnish 
an evening's amusement for readers, however 
numerous, who would just as readily study any 
other biography as that of Galton, if only it 
chanced to be entertaining." 

The "indolent reader" will, however, enjoy 
looking at the pictures, and if at all clever at 
skipping, will readily discover a large amount 
of generally interesting matter, mixed with 
materials which are printed mainly as matters 
of record, to be used by more serious students. 
He will marvel at the precocity of the young- 
ster, who, the day before his fifth birthday, 
wrote the following letter to his sister .- 
" My dear Adele : 

I am four years old and I can read any English 
book. I can say all the Latin substantives and 
adjectives and active verbs, besides 52 lines of 
Latin poetry. I can cast up any sum in addition 
and can multiply by

I can also say the pence table. I read French a

In his old age Galton said of his early accom- 
plishments: "In middle life I feared that 
I had been an intolerable prig, and cross-ques- 
tioned many old family friends about it, but 
was invariably assured that I was not at all a

prig . . . and that I was a nice little child." 
In his fifth year he was placed in a dame's 
school, and remained there for three years. 
The head mistress reported very highly of lit- 
tle Francis, and once added "the young gen- 
tleman is always found studying the abstruse 
sciences. ' ' 

At the age of eight the boy made his will, 
which begins as follows : 

" I, Francis Galton of the Larches near Birming- 
ham, make this my last Will and Testament - I 
give to my dearest sister Adele for her great kind- 
ness in teaching me all my English Books, my 
Watch, and all my Compound Money and Collec- 
tion of Beetles To Bessy, my Minerals and 
Shells To Lucy, my Hygrometer and Desk To 
Emma, my Medals ..." 

At the age of fourteen we find him at a typi- 
cal English boarding school, writing a diary of 
which the following is a fragment : 

" Monday, April 18 I knocked a fellow down 
for throwing a brick at me. 

Tuesday, April 19 I thrashed a snob for 
throwing stones. 

Wednesday, April 20 One of the boys bought 
a half-crown trumpet which made a tremendous 
row. 

Thursday, April 21 We bought a birch pro 
bono publico for 15 shillings. 

Friday, April 22 A tremendous row in the 
streets, on account of a blaguard thrashing one of 
our boys. 

Monday, April 25 Saw the 1st swallow this 
3 r ear. 

Tuesday, April 26 Got 30 lines of Virgil. 

Wednesday, April 27 Got 20 lines of Virgil. 

Tuesday, May 3 Got the syntax to write out 
for drawing a picture of a race. 

Sunday, May 8 Arnold preached. A fellow 
gave me a thrashing in the street." 

The "indolent reader" will not fail to be 
interested in the details of Galton 's medical 
education and life at Cambridge, of his travels 
in Europe, Egypt, Syria, and later in tropical 
South Africa. The African expedition was 
one of scientific exploration, and upon his re- 
turn he was at once recognized as a distin- 
guished geographer. 

Like many other capable men, Galton had 
more powers than he could well make use of. 
Professor Pearson remarks that during many 
years of friendship he never saw him handle 
the pencil, yet in his youth he could draw with 
skill. Among the many sketches reproduced 
is an excellent one of the Bishop's Gateway 
at Liege, as it appeared in 1838. It probably 
has been injured or destroyed in the present 
deplorable war. 

At the end of his discussion of Galton 's 
ancestry, Professor Pearson gives a very in- 
teresting analysis of his physical and mental 
characteristics, and endeavors to determine 



how these agree with the qualities of various 
ancestors. In concluding he says : ' ' Thus as 
most men Francis Galton was physically and 
mentally a blend of many ancestral traits. 
Whether they were 'unit characters' or not 
concerns us little here. What we do realize 
is that they were not the product of environ- 
ment, whether of home or school or college." 
Thus we find "nature" emphasized, and "nur- 
ture ' ' belittled ; a point of view nearly oppo- 
site to that of Lester Ward, which we recently 
discussed in these columns. The difference of 
attitude no doubt has arisen largely from cir- 
cumstances. Francis Galton 's life, projected 
against the relatively uniform background of 
English middle-class life, stands out promi- 
nently because of the man 's inherited qualities. 
Lester Ward, in a relatively new country of 
infinitely varied circumstances and opportuni- 
ties, could not fail to observe how these condi- 
tioned the development and success of men. 
Both ' ' nature ' ' and ' ' nurture ' ' are potent and 
necessary, and any social programme which 
overlooks either is sure to result in disaster.

Miss ELLEN KEY'S SOCIALISM.* 



One imagines it was her individualism that 
led Miss Ellen Key to write "The Younger 
Generation," a book on socialism. The in- 
dividual is never indifferent to her: she is 
far too passionate, too intense, to value any- 
thing so abstract and unreal as a mass. In 
other words, she is a woman and a poet first. 
and after that a social theorist. 

In her bias in favor of the individual, she 
only reflects that fierce individualism of the 
North which struck and even daunted the 
imagination of Europe in the grim and lonely 
figure of Ibsen, and outraged so many sensi- 
bilities in the remorseless egotism of Striiid- 
berg. Politically Ibsen and Miss Ellen Key 
are poles apart; spiritually which is all 
that matters they are really near together. 
She is a socialist for the same reason that he 
was an anarchist : because of an intense desire 
to bring about a greater freedom in the de- 
velopment of personality. 

Miss Key is a radical, of course; but she 
is a fastidious radical. She does not believe 
in the efficacy of easy nostrums; she is re- 
freshingly free from those very illusions we 
have no right to expect feminist leaders to 
have rid themselves of, as yet. She can, for 
example, be as heartily contemptuous of the 
vote as an American cynic sipping his whiskey 
and water in a club window ; she can speak of

parliaments as slightingly as Mr. Wells him- 
self. But it is significant that she rarely 
chooses to do so. These things political 
rights will come to women. Well, then, it- 
is necessary to be prepared for something 
else; it is necessary to keep one's eye fixed 
on the end rather than the means; and the 
end is an indefinite enhancement of life 
through the enrichment of the individual. 

Without knowing precisely what Miss Key's 
spiritual history has been, one hazards the 
guess that she became a socialist only after a 
prolonged and anxious weighing of the issues. 
Like so many other socialists of our time, she 
has not been without a fear of ultimate democ- 
racy. She has doubtless shuddered (as Wil- 
liam James shuddered) before the vision of 
a world transformed into a huge Chautauqua 
assembly, peaceful, stuffed with plenty, shock- 
ingly inert. For the values she prizes are 
never cheap values; they are the reverse; 
they are even (as in the case of marriage) a 
little too mystical and remote for the average 
man. They are often vague, but they are 
always ideal values and they are always char- 
acteristically feminine values. 

So it is natural that what she demands of 
socialism is that it shall produce not con- 
tented men, but better men. She has no wish 
to eliminate struggle; she wishes rather to 
persuade herself that socialism will not elim- 
inate struggle, and she does persuade herself 
at least. A civilization that cannot produce 
superior men is valueless. She is not in- 
different to the average man. She believes 
that the two rise together, and that the aver- 
age man is helpless without natural leaders. 
If he cannot breed them, he will not even hold 
his own; he will slip back. On the other 
hand, we do not expect a Darwin to be born 
in Tierra del Fuego; there is, of course, 
action and reaction. If she turns to social- 
ism, it is largely because she believes socialism 
will afford a better environment for the man 
of genius. 

Many vigorous opponents of socialism now 
concede that it is possible to improve the ma- 
terial condition of men in the gross. But, 
they say, you will do so only by depressing 
the whole human group, by perilously cur- 
tailing the opportunities of the fortunate few 
and by the fierce and stupid suppression of 
individual initiative. Miss Key does not blink 
this danger of the domination of the herd. 
She knows that democracies have not always 
been ideal breeding places of exceptional men. 
(She points to Switzerland and the United 
States.) There is a peril, but to offset that 
possible waste she points to the vast, the un- 
guessed release of energy that might result 



if the whole mass of mankind were miracu- 
lously to enjoy a place in the sun. Who can 
say how human progress might be accelerated 
if all the units of brain power born in each 
generation could be connected somehow with 
the driving wheel of civilization? Is it not 
conceivable that we should get on faster? 
Peasant stock has given us many men of 
genius, but only the strongest have been able 
to climb up, to survive the ordeal and 
genius is not always strong physically. In 
the face of this alluring possibility, she per- 
suades herself easily, far too easily, that the 
proletariat will succeed where the middle 
class has failed that it will be permanently 
idealistic. But, in the first place, this is a 
thing that has never happened to any class 
in society, and, in the second, we have abso- 
lutely no reason to believe that the proletariat 
is composed of better stuff than the middle 
class. It is even idle to contend that the 
great movement for social reform among the 
workers is in the main a disinterested move- 
ment. To admit that it is not, is not to criticize 
or belittle socialism. A disinterested move- 
ment could never accomplish so vast a task as 
the socialists have in mind. 

But if socialism is going to confer any ad- 
vantage on society, it will have to be a skep- 
tical and wary socialism, a socialism that has 
learned to distrust the organization that now 
makes it strong. And this is the gist of Miss 
Key 's message in ' ' The Younger Generation. ' ' 
It is a warning to socialists, though not to 
socialists alone. We live in an age of associa- 
tion, following upon an age in which indi- 
vidualism had reached the homicidal stage, 
and we have carried organization too far. 
' ' The atmosphere created by association makes 
those who live in it 'devoid of responsibility 
and remorse, ' to borrow one of Kierkegaard 's 
profound sayings of the dangers of shared 
activity." Miss Key is far from being alone 
in urging us to be on our guard against the 
so-called "social conscience." All that is 
deep and valuable in the human spirit is ma- 
tured in silence and in lonely meditation. 
We cannot save our souls in a group. "What 
is public opinion ? ' ' asked Nietzsche. And he 
answered, " It is private indolence. ' ' A social- 
ist state which put down private opinion 
would be a social disaster, no matter how 
comfortable its members might be. So would 
a socialist state that interfered with the free 
development of its citizens. The servile state 
has no part in her dreams of the future. And 
socialists above all must rise to an under- 
standing of the precise virtue there is in 
association, cooperation in the business of 
getting food and other material things; but 



252 



THE DIAL, 



[ Oct. 1 



in the life of the spirit an intense and even 
fierce independence, an individualism as 
vigorous and uncompromising as that of 
Nietzsche himself. 

It is characteristic of Miss Key's idealism 
that she accepts this communistic ideal with- 
out a rigid examination of the underlying 
economic argument. How is socialism to be 
brought about ? What is to be the machinery ? 
She does not concern herself with all that. 
She says simply: "I do not understand it." 
Her acceptance of its ideal is the result of her 
woman 's revolt a sentimental revolt, if you 
will against suffering that she believes to 
be needless. Human society cannot remain 
indifferent; it must find a way out. Being 
impatient of arguments, she does not herself 
argue. Indeed, she distrusts intellectualism 
altogether; she relies largely on intuition. 
She would infect you with her enthusiasm 
rather than convince your mind. She speaks 
always as a seer rather than as a thinker, and 
doubtless she is wise to do so. 

By way of postscript, one would add that 
there is included in this volume an essay on 
universal peace. In a recent London dispatch 
Mr. Francis Grierson was reported to have 
remarked that the great European war will 
doubtless overwhelm many Utopian philoso- 
phies. One can only say for Miss Ellen Key 
that she is not a peace advocate of the "im- 
possibilist" school. Having said so much, 
however, one really feels justified in saying 
no more for the present. It is undeniably a 
sad time for idealism of whatever sort.

BRITISH ADMINISTRATION IN EGYPT AND 
THE SUDAN.* 



Mr. Sidney Low's "Egypt in Transition" 
is a well-written book of travel. It is, more- 
over, a fresh and painstaking study of the 
problems involved in the administration of 
tropical dependencies. Half of the volume 
relates to Egypt proper and is made up of 
chapters dealing with the physical aspect of 
the country, the life of the people, the agencies 
of government, the reforms introduced in the 
past quarter-century by English administra- 
tors and advisers. The first twelve or fifteen 
chapters, however, are devoted to a record of 
impressions of the Sudan, and this is distinctly 
the most original and valuable part of the 
book. 

To the world at large the Sudan is a terra 
incognita; and even Englishmen commonly

duction by the Earl of Cromer. With portraits. New York : 
The Macmillan Co. 



think of it only as the scene of Gordon 's tragic 
death, the theatre of General Kitchener 's many 
brilliant exploits, and a field of occasional 
friction with the French. In some introduc- 
tory pages which he contributes to Mr. Low's 
book, Lord Cromer avows the opinion that, 
although the form of government maintained 
by the English in the Sudan is both unique 
and singularly successful, there are not a 
dozen people in all England (with the excep- 
tion of experts, who might be numbered on 
the fingers of one hand) who could give an 
approximately accurate account of what that 
form of government is. None the less, the 
Sudan is a region two-thirds as large as India, 
with a population of three millions, rich in 
resources and economic possibilities, and the 
scene of some of the most interesting of con- 
temporary experiments in the domain of trop- 
ical statecraft. In the Introduction mentioned 
Lord Cromer explains very clearly and with 
unimpeachable authoritativeness the essentials 
of English administrative policy in the Sudan 
and puts the reader in a position to under- 
stand rather better the transformations re- 
corded in Mr. Low's chapters. 

As the title of the book indicates, the author 
is writing of a country whose life and institu- 
tions are undergoing rapid change. It is only 
within the past sixteen years that the terri- 
tory has been drawn definitely within the 
British sphere of dominion, and its govern- 
ment and life have been subjected to a trans- 
formation symbolized perhaps most adequately 
by the rising of the present splendid city of 
Khartoum on the ruins of the old human 
warren which bore that name. In Mr. Low's 
opinion, the administrators of the Sudan are 
more fortunate than those whose theatre of 
action is countries thickly grown over with 
the tradition and inheritance of the past, such 
as India and Egypt. The ground has been 
cleared for them by war and revolution and 
they can lay their own foundations and build 
upon them. Under the agreement of 1899 the 
territory is a condominium of Great Britain 
and Egypt, each party possessing a half- 
interest. In effect, it is administered by En- 
glish officials, with the assistance of Egyptian 
subordinates, and defended by a force of 
Egyptian and Sudanese troops under English 
command; and, inasmuch as Englishmen are 
managing the affairs of the territory openly 
and independently, there is no need to keep 
up, as is kept up in Egypt, the fiction of their 
being "advisers" to native administrators. As 
explained in Lord Cromer 's Introduction, 
the success with which the English adminis- 
trators have met is attributable, first, to the 
fact that the form of government is singularly 



1914] 



THE DIAL 



253 



adapted to the peculiar condition and require- 
ments of the country ; second, to the unusual 
measure of independence which the Sudanese 
officials have enjoyed; and third, to their ex- 
cellent pay and the generous rules governing 
their vacations. Both Lord Cromer and Mr. 
Low record experiences and observations 
which should be pondered by Americans hav- 
ing to do with government in the Philippines. 
With respect to Egypt, the author makes 
clear the fact that the English do not govern 
it, but only govern its governors. The prom- 
ise that was made in 1882 not to annex Egypt 
or incorporate it in the British Empire he 
declares to have been ' ' given in haste and with 
an inadequate knowledge of the facts. ' ' If the 
facts had been known, he avers, the promise 
would never have been given at all. "But," 
he goes on to say, "given it was; and the 
policy it suggests has been steadily kept in 
view. Honestly and laboriously we have been 
trying to pave the way for complete internal 
autonomy under native direction. ' ' The Egyp- 
tian Turk, it is freely admitted, is not fond 
of British rule. With the individual English- 
man he can sometimes get on pretty well, but 
for English government he has small liking, 
even though he may himself be doing well 
under it. The system of control prevailing 
under the British occupation is characterized 
aptly as "government by inspection and 
authoritative advice." Mr. Low regards it as 
by no means entirely satisfactory, and he 
points out as its more conspicuous defects its 
makeshift character, the halting administra- 
tion of criminal justice, and the fetters im- 
posed by vexatious international pledges and 
restrictions. Especially does he deplore the 
effects of the capitulations, the treaties 
and conventions under which Europeans in 
the East are exempted from the jurisdiction 
of the local tribunals. That there was once 
ample justification for these agreements he 
readily admits; but he is insistent that they 
are no longer needed and that they ought to 
be abolished. Indeed, the author would have 
his country go so far as to dismiss alto- 
gether the fiction of a temporary occupation, 
proclaim Egypt a British protectorate, and 
make known to the world that the British Em- 
pire is, and will continue, responsible for the 
territory's external security and internal 
order. With Austria-Hungary formally an- 
nexing Bosnia and Herzegovina and Italy 
seizing the Tripolitaine, he feels that the self- 
restrained course of the English in Egypt is 
rather distinctly creditable to English diplo- 
macy. Of the strength and prospects of the 
Nationalist movement in the country he has 
a poor opinion; although he is bound to con- 



clude that for English dominance there is lit- 
tle affection. "The peasantry," he says, "do 
not know us ; the superior classes do not want 
us. ' ' And he specially warns against the idea 
that Egypt is being, or will be, Christianized 
and that Mohammedan countries are neces- 
sarily impervious to new ideas, inventions, and 



' modernization. ' : 



FREDERIC AUSTIN OGG. 



RECENT POETRY.* 



Mr. T. Sturge Moore often, to borrow a 
phrase of his own, "uses speech in an arch 
style,"- not to say in a manner that is 
frankly archaic. Inversions are frequent in 
his verse, and although the meaning is often 
simple, the reader must sometimes double 
upon his tracks to discover it. This, however, 
is only a minor mannerism of a poetic style 
that is full of beauty and distinction. There 
is little that is modern in Mr. Moore's work, 
if by "modern" one means the representation 
of the externals of contemporary life, but 
modern feeling is recorded in richly beautiful 
forms. For the symbols of his emotions Mr. 
Moore uses Greek stories or myths, but it is 
the essential inner core of the mystery rather 
than the outer trapping that appeals to him; 
and in poems such as "Semele, " "The Thigh 
of Zeus," "A Prayer, "or "The Dying Swan" 
the mood transcends the mode and life itself 
seems to supersede the vehicle of expression. 
We quote the last of these : 

" O silver-throated Swan 
Struck, struck! a golden dart 
Clean through thy breast has gone 
Home to thy heart. 
Thrill, thrill, O silver throat! 
O silver trumpet, pour 
Love for defiance back 
On him who smote! 
And brim, brim o'er 
With love ; and ruby-dye thy track 
Down thy last living reach 
Of river, sail the golden light 
Enter the sun's heart even teach, 
wondrous-gifted Pain, teach thou 
The God of love, let him learn how !" 

The formal beauty of Mr. Moore's verse is 
based upon close rhythmic and sound har- 
monies. It is hardly possible that he will be 
called upon to bear the burden of popularity, 
but his rare qualities will continue inevitably 
to attract the lover of poetry.

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1 



Mr. Robert Frost's new book of poems, 
"North of Boston," leaves such a strong im- 
pression of men and women in the mind that 
one is led to think of it as a new novel rather 
than as a book of verse. This is a significant 
fact. Mr. Frost, using verse, and without in the 
least forcing the idea, has conveyed an im- 
pression of life such as might be conveyed by 
Mr. Henry James or Mr. Joseph Conrad in 
prose. Mr. Frost's first book of verse, "A 
Boy 's Will, ' ' was a volume of lyrics, fanciful, 
inventive, and with a certain whimsical twist, 
yet with very little of this more substantial 
quality. The sparse New England pasture 
with its outcropping granite boulders and 
the sparse New England character with its 
outcropping strata of close-grained, hard- 
headed practicality and its unexpected sunny 
levels of human idealism (the amazing Puri- 
tan compound) these are both revealed 
through the sympathetic, kindly, but keenly 
humorous vision of Mr. Frost. Mr. Frost's 
feeling for nature is not romantic ; nor is it 
realistic in an external sense. Rather it gives 
us a direct sense of the earth ; that close con- 
nection between nature and man which is only 
gained by constant companionship or by that 
intimacy of toil in which the earth gives up 
only what is demanded of her. In cities we 
lose this sense of nature. Mr. Frost restores 
to us the direct primitive sense of the earth. 
A mountain, a field, or a wood exists for him 
as it exists in life. They are not shadowy, 
symbolic, or romantic shapes. They are real, 
they occupy space; they count as much as 
people count, and sometimes more, in a man 's 
consciousness. Doubtless there will be many 
readers who will find Mr. Frost dull, and who 
will object to his verse structure. There is 
no denying that his insistent monosyllabic 
monotony is irritating, but it may be ques- 
tioned whether any less drab monotony of 
rhythm would have been so successful in con- 
veying the particular aspect of life presented. 
Mr. Frost is at his finest in his subtle delinea- 
tion of Yankee heroics in ' ' The Code, ' ' in his 
whimsical humoresque, ' ' A Hundred Collars, ' ' 
in the drab tragedy of "The Death of the 
Hired Man," and in the cold conflict of sun- 
dered temperaments revealed in the poem 
called "Home Burial." All these poems are 
too long to quote in full, and it would only 
misrepresent them to quote parts of them. So 
it must be flatly asserted that in the particular 
field Mr. Frost has chosen he is to be compared 
with Mr. John Masefield, Mr. D. H. Lawrence, 
and Mr. W. W. Gibson, the three English poets 
who are most eager in the attempt to express 
the gesture and the feeling of everyday life in 
something other than ' ' the grand style. ' ' 



Mrs. Dora Sigerson Shorter has a delicate 
lyric gift and her work always impresses the 
reader with the graceful spontaneity of one 
who sings to please herself, and, incidentally, 
others. Her latest small book, "Madge Linsey, 
and Other Poems," contains the ballad of the 
title and several shorter poems and lyrics. 
Perhaps the most charming of these is 
"Build No Roof Tree Over Thee" or "The 
Little Bells of Sevilla," with its suggestive 
air: 

" The ladies of Sevilla go forth to take the air, 
They loop their lace mantillas, a red rose in the 

hair ; 

Upon the road Delicias their little horses run, 
And tinkle, tinkle, tinkle, the bells go every one. 

Beside the Guadalquivir, by orange-scented way, 
The ladies of Sevilla they come at cool of day; 
They wave their fans coquettish, their black eyes 

gleam and glow, 
And all their little carriage bells a-jingle, jingle go." 

Any one who has ever been in Seville will 
recognize the truth of the impression. 

Mr. MacGill, who is only twenty-one, and 
who has been "a farm-hand, driver, tramp, 
harness-man, navvy, plate-layer, and wres- 
tler," has resolutely set himself to celebrate 
these various experiences in verse. But he 
has not proved himself as skilful in .wrestling 
with the Muse as with his fellow navvies. In 
fact in his initial poem, "The Pick," he 
shows unmistakable symptoms of "the dis- 
ease of cosmicality, " supposed to belong ex- 
clusively to American poets: 
"In the depths of the pluvial season it gallantly 

stayed to your hand, 
In the dead end of woe and creation, afar in the 

furthermost land, 
When the saturnine heavens hung o'er you as dark 

as the ultimate tomb, 
When the rough of the valley you gutted was filled 

with ineffable gloom, 
When down in the depths of the planet uprooting 

the brontosaur's bed, 
With the fire-damp writhing around you, and a 

candle affixed to your head, 
When the gold-seeking fever enthralled you, when 

you fitfully watered the pan, 
Ever it strove to your bidding, ever it aided your 

plan, 
Ready, resistless, reticent, friend of the conquering 

man!" 

Further on in the same poem Mr. MacGill 
imposes this rather difficult injunction: 
" Look on your pick as a lover would gaze on the 
girl at his side." 

The ' ' Manchester Guardian ' ' cautiously states 
that Mr. MacGill ' ' has been called the greatest 
poet since Kipling." And then, becoming 
less cautious, the paper says: "At once elo- 
quent and susceptible, he has the typical 



1914] 



THE DIAL 



255 



poetic temperament." Unfortunately Mr. 
MacGill's chief susceptibility is to the elo- 
quence of Mr. Kipling, and we fear that a 
susceptibility to another's eloquence is no 
more commendable than the courage of the 
opinions of others. At any rate, it does not 
constitute a poet. 

In Mr. Oppenheim's poems one finds the 
outward form of Whitman without the essen- 
tial kindling warmth of the inner spirit. At 
least there is a surface resemblance to Whit- 
man in the form, but the resemblance is only 
skin-deep. Whitman's verse was not metric 
but rhythmic. Mr. Oppenheim's lines are 
neither metric nor rhythmic. Verse that ap- 
proaches prose in rhythm must at least fur- 
nish a rhythm as satisfying to the ear as good 
prose. Chopping phrases or sentences into 
lines, with abrupt pauses and monotonous 
antitheses, does not make good verse or 
good prose. Throughout the book one is con- 
scious that Mr. Oppenheim comes danger- 
ously near to re-writing Whitman in certain 
passages. But of course one realizes that any 
prophet must be constantly paraphrased, and 
it is not to this that one objects so much as 
to the hardening of the spirit of revolt into 
platitude. The poem entitled "The Slave," 
for instance, is undoubtedly true philosophy 
but it leaves one cold : 

" They set the slave free, striking off his chain. . . . 
Then he was as much of a slave as ever. 

He was chained to servility, 

He was still manacled to indolence and sloth, 

He was still bound by fear and superstition, 

By ignorance, suspicion, and savagery . . . 

His slavery was not in the chains, 

But in himself . . . 

They only set free men free . . . 
And there is no need of that: 
Free men set themselves free." 

Possibly it is the sensuous appeal that one 
misses in Mr. Oppenheim. His expression 
rarely exceeds statement, and statement may, 
as we have said, present correctly the modern 
intellectual attitude of revolt while failing 

utterly to arouse.

military students for those " battles of the future " 
which are now of the present, is being translated 
into English by Mr. G. Frederic Lees. It empha- 
sizes the supreme importance of the personal 
element in military leadership, arguing that though 
Napoleon carried his centralization to excess, 
nothing can replace the commander-in-chief who 
is able at the decisive moment to assume sole 
authority over his forces. 



RECENT FICTION.* 



Popularity is mostly a mystery. Publishers 
speak dogmatically about "what will go and 
what won't," only to admit that the longer 
they study the problem the more puzzled they 
are. Writers, except those who have a large 
and faithful audience, generally assert that 
the public's demand is utterly irrational. 
Readers are seldom able satisfactorily to ac- 
count for so much as their own- individual 
preferences. Reviewers are notoriously help- 
less to prophesy, however alert they may be 
to explain, a novel's popularity. The diffi- 
culty may lie partly in the fact that there are 
novel-reading publics rather than a novel- 
reading public. Mr. George Barr McCutcheon 
and Mr. Winston Churchill are both popular 
novelists, but it may be that very few persons 
read them both. It is possible that what 
alienates one numerous sort of reader is the 
thing that delights another numerous sort. 
The reasons given why a particular novel will 
not succeed might be altogether valid for the 
particular public which the reasoner had in 
mind and not at all valid for another public 
which it had not occurred to him to consider. 

Mr. Coningsby Dawson has apparently put 
something for almost everybody into "The 
Raft." It starts off with a discussion be- 
tween two young women of their helpless need 
of men to marry, as if that were to be the 
theme of the book. Serious-minded readers, 
who like to feel that they are getting some- 
thing over and above mere amusement for 
their time, and reviewers, who are aware how 
much easier it is to discuss a novel that is based 
on an idea than one that is not, are pleased to 
discover these sentences : 

" ' We're two girls adrift on a raft and we can't 
swim. Over there's the land of marriage, with all 
the little children, the homes, and the husbands; 
we've no means of getting to it. Unless some of 
the men see us and put off in boats to our rescue, 
we'll be caught in the current of the years and 
swept out into the hunger of mid-ocean. But 
they're too busy to notice us. Oh, dear!' " 

Unfortunately or perhaps fortunately, as 
long as serious-minded readers and reviewers 
are so small a public Mr. Dawson did not 
choose to elaborate this conception. He had 
too many other things on his mind. He had

thirty or forty characters to present, a num- 
ber of love stories to tell, and much tender 
observation of the human desire for goodness 
to record. Sometimes, as in the first part of 
"The Raft," Mr. Dawson affects the contem- 
porary realistic manner ; sometimes, and much 
more often, he writes in the whimsical vein of 
certain stories told for children ; and he never 
misses an opportunity to inject the wistfully 
sentimental flavor. There is no doubt that 
Mr. Dawson has read Dickens, obvious as are 
his dissimilarities to that master of a special 
convention, and no doubt that his novels are 
an expression of his own temperament. But 
his eye is a misty one. 

In "Saturday's Child," Mrs. Kathleen 
Norris has written a thoroughly American 
story of an exceptional young woman who 
achieved a husband, children, and a home in 
spite of poverty, and in spite of the tempta- 
tion offered by riches. Susan Brown is intro- 
duced to us as a thirty dollar a month clerk 
in San Francisco. She was lazy but am- 
bitious, eager but uncertain. She wanted to 
do something; she did not know what. A 
distinguished novelist offered himself and she 
would have become his mistress but for an 
accident that made her miss the boat on 
which she was going away with him. In the 
end she found a sincere man, a labor leader, 
whom she deeply loved and who loved her. 
We in America like our heroines to be like 
that, do we not? Mrs. Norris makes no at- 
tempt at fine writing, but presents a wealth 
of observed detail, homely, recognizable, and 
usually interesting. There is too much of it; 
a more finished artist would have done better 
with less; but Mrs. Norris has made a sub- 
stantial fabric background of it. And if the 
whole is a little overcharged with sentiment 
and morality, it is not really mawkish. 

Mrs. Josephine Daskam Bacon is a skilled 
journalist, observant of the day's tendency 
and prepared to discuss it. She has designed 
"To-Day 's Daughter" to illustrate the "prob- 
lem ' ' of the contemporary middle-class woman 
who spends a large income and who is not 
content to be wife and mother, mistress and 
friend to her husband. The volume presents 
a number of variations on the type, each of 
whit3h would stand by itself as a short story 
but for the Dr. Fanchon who serves as deus 
ex machina in all of them. One example is 
the woman who neglects her husband for a 
dozen reformist activities, only to discover 
that her real happiness is to be achieved by 
living as his squaw under the most primitive 
conditions. Another is a woman whose suc- 
cess as an interior decorator is hollow because 
she and her husband are estranged. A third 



is a woman whose vogue as a portrait painter 
is sufficient to enable her to pay all her share 
of keeping up several establishments and the 
expenses of the children besides, so that her 
husband has not the slightest claim upon her. 
Most of the cases are argued out easily and 
sensibly by Dr. Fanchon. He is master of 
every situation except the last of the three 
mentioned, and even that he partly dominates 
by reason of an eloquent lecture on the pri- 
mary social importance of preserving the fam- 
ily. The chief objection to Mrs. Bacon 's stories 
is that they are too readily resolved by a 
formula. Some of her simplification of the 
issues involved is in the interests of space 
rather than in the interests of illumination. 
A whole volume is not too much to devote to 
a single instance of the sort which interests 
her. And to have done the thing more by the 
method of the novelist and less by that of the 
pamphleteer would have made her moral the 
more convincing for being the less insisted 
upon. 

It is easy enough to see what string Miss 
Marjorie Ben ton Cooke's "Bambi" is meant 
to pull. It is no plea for the sex, but a bare- 
faced glorification of it. Bambi is only nine- 
teen when she marries, against his will, a 
romantic young idealist of a playwright in 
order to take care of him, make a success of 
him, and teach him to love her. Bambi 's 
capacity easily enables her to support her 
husband and to re-create him at the same time. 
She dashes off a story that wins a prize and 
an order to do a series for a magazine. Jarvis 
struggles heroically to bring forth a play which 
Mr. Belasco will have none of. Bambi per- 
suades Mr. Frohman to give her husband the 
chance to dramatize her story (which he does 
not know she has written) and then does all 
the good things in the play herself, even to 
directing the leading actress's playing of her 
part. "When Jarvis is sufficiently humiliated 
to learn his trade, Bambi accepts him as her 
consort. The story is brightly written in the 
briefest of paragraphs, with an eye to such 
contemporary events as Mr. Richard Bennett's 
recent tour with "Damaged Goods" and a 
reckless freedom in the use of actual celeb- 
rities for a background. But would a play- 
wright so high-vaulting as to think Mr. 
Bernard Shaw of no consequence, Sir James 
Barrie a questionable success in the theatre, 
and Mr. Galsworthy a "pamphleteer" actually 
make Mr. David Belasco his first choice as a 
producing manager? It is a trivial matter 
beside the possibility that half the "flappers" 
of 1914 will imitate Bambi 's conduct. Think 
what it would mean to American literature in 
one decade if a dozen of them should !

Mr. A. S. M. Hutchinson has been greeted 
in some quarters as a romancer of at least the 
.second order. He is a painstaking writer. 
The agony of Mr. Puddlebox on the day he 
gave himself to the sea in order that Mr. 
Wriford might be saved is built up through 
thirty pages with a rhythmic beat that few of 
Mr. Hutchinson 's rivals could sustain. But 
some newspaper reporters could produce a 
more poignant effect in a column. That is 
the trouble with making too much of mere 
writing. But Mr. Hutchinson 's method would 
be of comparatively little consequence if the 
material on which he exercises it were sound. 
In the case of "The Clean Heart" it is not 
sound. It is the agony that Mr. Hutchinson 
is after, and agony that he insists upon. If 
he were less eager to squeeze the last possible 
tear from his situations he might perceive 
their essential falsity, and construct better 
ones. As it is, his architecture runs to deco- 
ration. He may very well please the naivete 
which welcomed the jig-saw, but he is merci- 
lessly exposed to the slightest sophistication. 

Miss Ethel Sidgwick is sophisticated to the 
last degree, and yet she is an artist. Occasion- 
ally, as in "A Lady of Leisure," she takes 
delight in her own virtuosity, an amusing 
but inevitably a stultifying game. Much of 
her dialogue demands a degree of attention 
if the results of her skilful indirection are 
not to be lost which few readers are likely 
to give it. But when Miss Sidgwick 's interest 
in her people takes hold of her, as it did in 
most of "Promise" and "Succession," and 
does in many passages of her present novel, 
she is a guide as well as a virtuoso. There is 
one passage in which a woman of the world is 
revealed, a passage in which exposition and 
analysis and narrative are so happily blended 
that the eye marches up and down her pages 
while the mind is satisfied. And just as the 
woman is taking shape as an extraordinarily 
competent person, Miss Sidgwick introduces 
the daughter Violet, and in a casual clause 
delivers the final stroke : 

" Violet on her side did not despise her mother, 
unless in passing flashes, when her father was 
badly worried : but from the age of ten years she 
had despised her tranquilly." 

We have not been quite ready to despise 
Eveleen, but immediately and without a pause 
we accept Violet 's verdict, which is precisely 
what Miss Sidgwick wishes us to do. "A Lady 
of Leisure" is a novel to interest the connois- 
seur of novels. But in the end he will vote it, 
in studio slang, "amusing." For Miss Sidg- 
wick 's sure hand is here devoted to an all 
but thankless task, and one hardly worthy

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



Education in 
its largest 
sense. 



Dr. C. Hanford Henderson's 
book, "What Is It to Be Edu- 
^^ cated ? " ( Houghton ) , is put forth 

as a sort of sequel to his widely read and whole- 
somely stimulating work, "Education and the 
Larger Life," but at the same time as an 
independent utterance sufficiently complete in 
itself to render unnecessary for its full under- 
standing any previous study of the antecedent 
volume. Elaboration and addition, rather than 
continuation, make up the substance of the 
later work, and show the writer's thought to 
have expanded and developed w r ith the dozen 
years separating the two books. How thor- 
oughly devoted to his chosen profession the 
author is may be gathered even from hap- 
hazard perusal of its pages, but particularly 
from such passages as the following extract 
from his preface : "In the long vacation, when 
my boys have all left me, and I sit alone before 
my big fireplace, brooding, I find myself keen 
to push aside the intervening months, to have 
it term-time once more, to start afresh, to do 
the thing infinitely better than I have just 
succeeded in doing it." The reason of this 
hope and expectation of doing the thing always 
better and better is that the teacher is forever 
continuing and never completing his own edu- 
cation, and his ability as a teacher keeps pace 
with his docility as a learner. A wide range 
of topics relating to culture in the largest 
sense, as well as to the pedagogical problem, 
will be found in the book 's agreeably rambling 
chapters. Even subjects so seemingly remote 
from the matter in hand as the influence of 
railroads on our civilization, some aspects of 
the servant problem, the desirability of wear- 
ing only such garments as can go frequently 
into the washtub, and the nightmare of race- 
suicide, are either cursorily or in some detail 
brought under discussion. Thus he will be a 
difficult person who cannot find something to 
engage his attention in the book. It is to be 
noted, by the way, that the author is no en- 
thusiast for the ancient classics as educational 
studies. He would allow their election in col- 
lege, but believes that until then other more 
important branches should have the prece- 
dence. And yet that very faultiness in the 
use of English which he notes in American 
boys is often most effectively and expeditiously 
corrected by imparting some knowledge of fun- 
damental language principles through a little 
study of a highly inflected tongue like Latin 
or Greek. Something of the spirit of this ad- 
mirable book of Mr. Henderson's may be 
caught from the few lines with which this 
brief notice must content itself to come to a

close. In a chapter headed "Live Your Own 
Life" he says, felicitously: "At twenty-one 
a man is not educated, however intelligently 
he has been brought up. At best, he is only 
educated up to twenty-one. And he is not even 
educated up to that age, unless he has been 
taught to see that this revelation of the moral 
and aesthetic universe which constitutes edu- 
cation, this unfolding and perfecting of the 
human spirit, is in reality a life-long adventure 
upon which he is consciously to enter, with a 
stout and merry heart." And in these few 
words we learn what it is to be educated, or, 
better, what it is to be undergoing education ; 
for true education is never static and finished. 



The biographies F . or ih ^ P 88 * two centuries the 
of two kings of England have been men 

kin 8 - of only moderate abilities, and 
the influence of kingship in the state has been 
steadily declining. Since William III. En- 
gland has had no great monarch; not even 
Queen Victoria with all her many virtues as a 
woman could lay any claim to real greatness 
in statesmanship. But during the long history 
of the English nation, many strong rulers 
have borne the crown; and kingship at one 
time was the greatest force in the government. 
It is significant that in this age of democratic 
growth an effort is being made to form a new 
estimate of the royal institution; in a series 
of biographies entitled "The Kings and 
Queens of England," edited by Mr. Robert S. 
Rait and Mr. William Page, we are to be told 
of what royalty has contributed to the great- 
ness of England, or, as Professor Shotwell 
puts it in his suggestive Introduction to the 
series, of "royalty at work rather than on 
display." Two volumes have thus far ap- 
peared: a biography of Henry II. by Mr. 
L. F. Salzmann and one of Henry VII. by Miss 
Gladys Temperley. There is little originality 
in Mr. Salzmann 's work; the early Angevin 
period has been tilled industriously by some 
of the most capable English historians and the 
reign of Henry II. has been previously studied 
almost exclusively from the viewpoint of the 
new series, for Henry II. was almost con- 
stantly at work and very rarely on display. 
The author has, however, produced a very 
readable account of Henry's life and activi- 
ties and an excellent summary of the results 
of his reign. It is the sort of book that stu- 
dents of English mediaeval history have long 
felt the need of, as the only complete biograph- 
ical study of Henry's life earlier published 
is Mrs. Green's little book in the "Twelve 
English Statesmen" series. In her study of 
the reign of Henry VII. Miss Temperley has 
had a greater opportunity and has conse-

diversions. 



quently been able to produce a more important 
biography. The facts of Henry VII. 's reign 
have long been known, but they have not 
always been perfectly understood, and the 
king's character has surely not been appreci- 
ated as it should be. The most important chap- 
ter of Miss Temperley 's book is the closing 
one, in which she discusses Henry VII. 's per- 
sonality and the importance of his reign. ' ' He 
was no sinister, savage despot, with no mind 
above the tortuous tricks of a suspicious 
tyranny, but a gracious, liberal-minded mon- 
arch, with a marked taste for splendour and 
pageantry, a more or less conscious imitator 
of the methods of the Italian despots." An 
important feature of both volumes is an 
"Itinerary," which traces the travels of each 
king and shows where he was on important 
dates, as far as the sources enable us to deter- 
mine his movements. This is of special im- 
portance for the reign of so restless a mon- 
arch as Henry II. Both volumes are provided 
with illustrations, chiefly portraits for the 
later work and pictures of material remains 
for the earlier. (Hough ton Mifflin Co.) 

The essay, reflective, rambling, 
reminiscent, and often packed 
with much genial philosophy 
and rich in the wisdom that comes of a con- 
siderable experience of human nature in its 
manifold types, has ever been the form of lit- 
erature in which the physician with a leaning 
to letters has shown himself most inclined to 
give written expression to his thoughts. To- 
the company of Sir Thomas Browne, Dr. 
John Brown, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Samuel 
Smiles, and other medical men who have 
sought diversion from professional cares in the 
writing of books not too taxing either to author 
or to reader, or who have in the end turned 
this agreeable avocation into a vocation, Dr. A. 
Stuart M. Chisholm knocks for admittance 
in his substantial volume of collected articles 
and addresses entitled "Recreations of a 
Physician" (Putnam). He writes on spe- 
cialization, physicians as men of letters, Shake- 
speare 's Banquo, the symbolism of names, 
royal authors, the inherent spirit of medicine, 
some translations of Horace (to which he adds 
two graceful ones of his own making), some 
features of seventeenth-century medicine, the 
picaro in fiction, and the prevention of dis- 
ease. It will be seen from these headings that 
he has not entirely renounced the doctor in 
assuming the author. Perhaps his present 
stage is that of the literary essayist in evolu- 
tion. At any rate, he writes in a manner to 
interest both the practitioner of medicine and 
the student of literature. Wide reading and 
scholarly reflection upon what he has read 



1914] 



THE DIAL,

show themselves in his chapters ; but he allows 
himself more space than the best judgment 
might dictate in certain themes lacking the 
element of novelty or importance to justify 
this indulgence. For instance, in discussing 
the symbolism of names he makes the famous 
confusion of " Undecemilla " with "undecim 
millia, " in the St. Ursula legend, an occasion 
for rehearsing the story of this saint and of 
the curious linguistic blunder on which it is 
supposed to be founded. In another essay he 
is perhaps not careful enough in his quotation 
when he says of Themistocles that he "seemed 
a little to disparage that softness of mind that 
is imparted by the study of the finer arts when 
he said disdainfully, 'that he could not play 
on the fiddle, but that he could make a small 
town a large city.' ' Plutarch's report of 
this utterance is, in Langhorne's translation: 
" Tis true I never learned how to tune a harp 
or play upon a lute, but I know how to raise a 
small and inconsiderable city to glory and 
greatness." Mentioning certain modern doc- 
tors of medicine who have contributed to litera- 
ture, Dr. Holmes, John Brown, William H. 
Drummond, S. Weir Mitchell, Dr. Virchow, 
J. G. Holland, Clemenceau, and Sir Conan 
Doyle, the author allows "especial magni- 
tude" to Holmes alone. These studies (for 
they are rather studies than essays in anything 
like the Elian sense) show their author to be 
a man of varied interests and scholarly tastes. 



s through Mr - Russell Richardson 's "Eu- 
war-expectant rope from a Motor Car (Rand, 
McNally & Co.) describes an 
American motorist's tour in a German car 
from Berlin through parts of Germany, Aus- 
tria, Italy, France, and a few miles into Spain, 
apparently in the summer of 1913. Much of 
the present significance of the observant tour- 
ist's unusually readable narrative lies in the 
frequent comment on the military prepara- 
tions and the expectancy of war which he 
noticed everywhere on his journey. The mix- 
ture of conservatism and sentiment that has 
retained for the French soldier the glaringly 
conspicuous uniform that now makes him an 
unnecessarily prominent target, is noted. But 
in time of peace the bright hues are pleasing. 
"This constant coming and going of the 
French soldiers gives much color and anima- 
tion to the street scenes. Everyone is im- 
pressed by the cuirassiers. They are powerfully 
built and look so effective, like real soldiers 
' who could uphold the traditions of Napoleon 's 
time, and who would feel much more at home 
on the battle-field than at an afternoon tea." 
Rural France, conservative and slow, is re- 
garded by the author as voicing with no excess 



of vehemence the prevalent anti-German sen- 
timent. "No feature of our long tour through 
France was more instructive than this oppor- 
tunity to study at first hand the influences at 
work to widen the gulf between the two na- 
tions. We conversed with soldiers, officers, 
peasants in the fields, and casual French ac- 
quaintances whom we met in the cafes and 
hotels. Everyone admitted the gravity of the 
situation, and said that nothing short of the 
actual shadow of German invasion could have 
induced France to submit to the tremendous 
sacrifices incident to the large increase of the 
army." A part of Mr. Richardson's tour 
nearly coincided with a part of President Pom- 
care 's last year's motor journey through the 
provinces, and the author says : ' ' France has 
found her leader, a man of vast energy who 
understands his country's problems and is 
peculiarly fitted to solve them. His motor 
tour through the provinces was like a trium- 
phal march. Everywhere he preached that 
gospel of unity which is the great need of the 
hour. ' ' But the thrill of imminent war is not 
the book's only attraction. Description and 
observation of more than average interest are 
spiced with motor perils (as in the Stelvio 
Pass), a sufficient account of the Spanish na- 
tional amusement as witnesed at San Sebas- 
tian, and other topics that dispel somnolence. 
The motor-author might perhaps do well to 
use some such term as odometer (journey- 
measurer) instead of speedometer for the in- 
strument recording, not the rate of progress, 
but the distance travelled. Many good pic- 
tures, of Underwood & Underwood origin, and 
a handy map (in duplicate, on both end-leaves) 
accompany the narrative.

A history that the histories of the more im- 

of Princeton. . ,- , 

portant American colleges and 
universities are just now beginning to be 
written. Great schools of learning are made 
by men, and, as is the case with men, their 
stories should be told as soon as they have 
accomplished something that is unique and 
enduring. Mr. Varnum Lansing Collins 's 
"Princeton" (Oxford University Press) will 
be read, therefore, with much profit, not only 
by Princeton graduates but by many others 
because of the prominent role that this insti- 
tution has played in the history of this coun- 
try ; and it will be read with pleasure, for Mr. 
Collins has told the story of his Alma Mater 
without the slightest taint of the chauvinist 
or the malcontent, and with an unwavering 
adherence to the human side of his theme. It 
is a rare specimen of objective narration, for 
affectionate attachment to an institution of 



260 



THE DIAL 



I Oct. 1 



learning does not exactly favor this sort of 
writing. The story of Princeton has already 
been told, but only in a rather documentary 
fashion ; and histories of living institutions 
have always to be brought down to the present. 
Mr. Collins has done this with brief discussion 
of the administrations of Presidents Patton, 
Wilson, and Hibben. The periods around 
which he groups the history of Princeton are 
the Colonial (1746-68), the Revolutionary 
(1768-94), the ante-Bellum (1794-1868), the 
Transition (1868-88), and the Modern (1888-). 
Of these, the first three are the most interest- 
ing. How Princetonians must rejoice to read 
of those days of humble beginnings that were 
to grow into great things as the result of the 
labors of a few men actuated by the motives 
that spring from religious conviction, political 
foresight, and interests that necessitate sac- 
rifice ! And how New Haven men must rejoice 
to read that, so far as early presidents and 
trustees are concerned, Yale is the mother of 
Princeton ! A number of facts more curious 
than important will attract the reader 's atten- 
tion in passing; for instance, the odd regula- 
tion that a student ' ' may absent himself from 
class exercises forty-nine times in two con- 
secutive terms," and the opening of the uni- 
versity's ledger with the statement that each 
student costs the university three hundred and 
thirty-one dollars and fifty cents more than it 
receives from him. Little mention is made 
of the purely intellectual attainments and 
achievements of the Princeton graduates. Mr. 
Collins undoubtedly thought, in this connec- 
tion, that items of this sort can be better cared 
for in catalogues, bibliographies, records of 
learned societies, and so on. Be that as it 
may, their inclusion would have added but 
little to his delightful volume, so excellently 
written and so abounding in touches of human 
appeal to many without the gates of Old 
Nassau. 

Mr. Stanley C. Johnson's "His- 
^SthAmSa. tor - v of Emigration from the 

United Kingdom to North Amer- 
ica, 1763-1912," is a thesis submitted in 
partial fulfilment of the requirements for the 
degree of doctor of science in the University 
of London and published in a series of mono- 
graphs edited by the Director of the London 
School of Economics and Political Science. It 
is a very satisfactory piece of work. The 
author has conceived his subject broadly and 
has used his materials with diligence and dis- 
crimination. An introductory chapter sums 
up such meagre information as can be had 
concerning English, Scottish, and Irish emi- 
gration to America between the close of the 
Seven Years' War and the restoration of 



peace in 1815. This is followed by a brief 
historical survey (which, happily, is not over- 
loaded with statistics) covering the period 
1815-1912. Nine-tenths of the volume, how- 
ever, is descriptive rather than narrative. 
Subjects to which ample consideration is ac- 
corded include the causes of emigration, as- 
sisted emigration, the restriction of emigra- 
tion, the transportation and distribution of 
emigrants, the land systems encountered by 
emigrants in America, past and present 
schemes of colonization, the emigration of 
women and children, and the economic and 
social effects of emigration. The volume closes 
with a statistical appendix and a full and val- 
uable bibliography. The emigration which is 
brought under survey is principally that from 
Great Britain and Ireland to the present 
British dependencies in the new world. But 
the phenomena considered are largely such as 
are exhibited no less by emigration to Aus- 
tralia, South Africa, and other lands, so that 
the book becomes virtually a study of British 
and Irish emigration in general. In our day 
approximately three hundred thousand men. 
women, and children go out each year from 
the United Kingdom to settle in distant por- 
tions of the world. In health and capacity 
for labor they are rather above than below 
the average. The question which inevitably 
comes is whether Great Britain can afford to 
lose, in ever-growing numbers, these pro- 
ductive elements of her population. The con- 
clusion reached by the author seems to be 
that the effects of the drain can be withstood 
successfully, provided, first, that the outflow 
shall not exceed the natural increase, at home, 
of births over deaths; second, that those who 
migrate shall settle principally in Canada. 
Australia, and other British dependencies; 
and, third, that these dependencies shall agree 
definitely to assist the mother country in 
bearing the burden of Imperial Defence. Con- 
temporary developments indicate that the 
last-mentioned of these conditions, at least, is 
assured of fulfilment. (E. P. Dutton & Co.) 



The best way 
to winter . 
in Italy. 



Not all of us can afford the 
luxury of an Italian villa in 
which to pass the months of mid- 
winter and early spring, but all can enjoy the 
luxury by proxy and in imagination by read- 
ing Mr. J. Lucas's detailed account of his 
quest and acquisition of an ideal residence on 
the hillside of Fiesole, near Florence. " Our 
Villa in Italy" (Duffield) makes one ac- 
quainted, in some measure at least, with Mr. 
and Mrs. Lucas, their pleasant life in the five- 
century-old house where once lived no less a 
personage than the famous author and states- 
man, Massimo d'Azeglio, their picturesque and

historic neighborhood, their nine-acre farm or 
podere and its products, and some interesting 
particulars as to the rare old furniture and 
pottery with which they beautified their splen- 
did abode for splendid it appears in the 
telling of the interesting story and in the 
abundant illustrations that help to complete 
the mental picture painted by the author's 
pen. Delightfully characteristic of Italian 
mercantile methods are the incidents related 
in connection with the purchase of cabinets 
and majolica and other useful or decorative 
articles for the villa's interior. Mr. Lucas is 
evidently no novice in the subtleties of Italian 
commerce. As a whole, his book is a most 
agreeable blending of the poetic, the imag- 
inative, and the romantic-historic, on the one 
hand, with the practical, the domestic, the 
homely and pleasantly realistic, on the other. 
Until European travel conditions improve, one 
ought to find in Mr. Lucas's chapters some 
measure of solace for the necessity of fore- 
going a visit to the country he knows so well 
and writes of so entertainingly. 



The Hussite movement of the 

A study of fiftppnth ppntnrv and thp resnlt- 

the Hussite wars. . LI V ., , 

ing Bohemian civil w r ars have up 
to the present been studied chiefly from the 
Roman Catholic viewpoint. Recently, how- 
ever, Count Ltitzow, the biographer of John 
IIuss, has made the Hussite Wars the subject of 
extensive and thorough research, and has come 
to believe that the conventional ideas concern- 
ing this movement are largely based on error. 
Though Count Liitzow grants that the move- 
ment had an important religious phase, he 
presents it in "The Hussite Wars" (Button) 
chiefly as a national Bohemian movement. It 
is the nationalist Slav rather than the re- 
ligious zealot that the author believes to be im- 
portant. Count Liitzow 's work will no doubt 
find a welcome among students of fifteenth 
century history; but it is not likely that his 
conclusions will be given immediate accep- 
tance, as the whole work is somewhat contro- 
versial in character. The subject matter is of 
great interest, but the author's style is heavy 
and his treatment of the facts is often so 
detailed as to be obscure and confusing. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



James Hinton was a remarkable person, espe- 
cially when his generation is taken into account, 
but there is little in his essay on " The Mystery of 
Pain" (Kennerley)to recommend it to the contem- 
porary reader except its excellent style. The 
present edition is reprinted from the original, pub- 
lished in London in 1866. 



Mr. Robert Ellis Thompson has endeavored in 
" The History of the Dwelling House and Its 
Future " (Lippincott) to " trace the gentle de- 
velopment of the house from its beginnings to the 
present time," and to suggest the possibilities of 
cooperative housekeeping. It is briefly and simply 
written. 

Professor William Bennett Munro has edited, 
and furnished a brief introduction to, " Selections 
from the Federalist" (Harvard University Press). 
Those letters were chosen which in the editor's 
experience had proved the best " starting-point for 
class-room discussion." The text is that of the 
original collected edition. 

The Rev. George L. Clark has written in "A 
History of Connecticut, Its People and Institu- 
tions " (Putnam) a description of Connecticut life 
rather than a study of Connecticut origins. There 
are chapters on literature, art, education, agricul- 
ture, philanthropy, and similar topics. The po- 
litical history of the past hundred years is largely 
ignored, but instead much matter of equal impor- 
tance, and of more general interest, is provided. 

Professor Herman G. James's "Applied City 
Government" (Harper) is accurately described 
by its sub-title, " The Principles and Practice of 
City Charter Making." It is a brief discussion of 
" Incorporation and Powers," " The Electorate," 
" The Recall and Direct Legislation," " The Form 
of Government," " The Administrative Officers," 
and " The City's Finances." Provisions of a model 
city charter are appended to each chapter. The 
book is primarily intended for classes in municipal 
government, but it should be of use to legislators. 

We have read before but we are glad to read 
again most of the essays which Mrs. Alice 
Meynell presents in her new book of " Essays " 
(Scribner). Selected mainly from her five pre- 
vious volumes, they show her delicate talent at its 
best. Nearly all of them, even those dealing with 
literary subjects, express the author's feeling for 
nature in one way or another, so that while her 
topics are sometimes as widely separated from 
each other as " Rushes and Reeds " and "A Point 
of Biography " and her method is the discursive 
one, a common emotion unites her volume. 

Professor Hugh Walker, author of "The Age 
of Tennyson " and of " The Literature of the Vic- 
torian Era," has written " Outlines of Victorian 
Literature" (Putnam), in collaboration with his 
wife. The avowed (and excellent) purpose of this 
small, compact volume, which draws upon the 
other two, is to " furnish an introduction, ... to 
stimulate interest and curiosity." Into the Out- 
lines have been crowded many bits of information 
regarding works written during the reign of Queen 
Victoria, but the book is valuable rather as a com- 
pendium than as a carefully developed history of 
literature. Although the authors are conscientious 
in their learning, they are unfortunately wanting 
in any instinctive or ardent sympathy with creative 
genius. For instance, the mediocre novelists 
are accorded much more adequate estimates 
than Meredith receives. His work is discussed in 
a trivial way, which gives the uninitiated no con- 
ception of his spiritual power and insight.

THE DIAI, 



[ Oct. 1 



1S T OTES. 



Mr. Beckles Willson is writing the authorized 
biography of the late Lord Strathcona. 

Mr. Rabindranath Tagore's play, " The King of 
the Dark Chamber," is announced by Messrs. Mac- 
millan. 

" Everyboy and Other Plays for Children," by 
Mrs. Isabel Anderson, is to be published this month 
by The Shakespeare Press. 

The anniversary of Louis Pasteur's death has 
just been commemorated in London by the 
publication of a study of Pasteur entitled " Pas- 
teur and after Pasteur," by Mr. Stephen Paget. 

Mr. J. W. Comyns Carr's " Coasting Bohemia " 
includes papers giving his personal impressions of 
George Meredith, Whistler, Millais, Rossetti. 
Burne-Jones, and others. The volume is announced 
for publication in England. 

Bulletin number six (August, 1914) of the 
Russell Sage Foundation Library devotes itself to 
a classified list of works on penal farms and penal 
colonies. Books, periodicals, society reports, and 
government publications have been ransacked for 
material. 

A collection of war poems to be issued at once 
in London by Messrs. Chatto and Windus will con- 
tain, besides the contributions of Mr. Robert 
Bridges, those of Laurence Binyon, Maurice Hew- 
lett, Alfred Noyes, Henry Newbolt, Rudyard Kip- 
ling, and G. K. Chesterton. 

Forty of the most perplexing passages in Shake- 
speare, beginning with the famous " Runaway's 
Eyes" in " Romeo and Juliet," are discussed by 
Mr. Charles D. Stewart in a volume to be brought 
out by the Yale University Press under the aus- 
pices of the Elizabethan Club. 

The tenth edition of Bartlett's " Familiar Quota- 
tions," 'revised and edited by Mr. Nathan Haskell 
Dole, is announced for publication in November by 
Messrs. Little, Brown & Co. It will contain extracts 
from some two hundred writers who are not in- 
cluded in any of the previous editions. 

Mr. Herman Whitaker is the editor of a volume 
of stories to be entitled " Westwinds," which 
Messrs. Paul Elder & Co. will publish under the 
auspices of the California Writers' Club. Among 
the contributors will be Mr. Jack London, Mr. 
Charles F. Lummis, and Mr. Torrey Connor. 

"Why We Are at War: Great Britain's Case," 
by members of the Oxford Historical Faculty, 
was published in London on September 14 by the 
Oxford University Press. It is now being trans- 
lated into the various European languages for 
issue on the Continent " as a counterblast to Ger- 
man lies." The contents have been contributed by 
E. Barker, H. W. C. Davies, C. R. L. Fletcher, 
Arthur Hassall, L. G. Wickham Legg, and F. 
Morgan. 

The death of Andrew Lang ended the succession 
of the " Fairy Book Series " which he edited and 
of which Messrs. Longmans, Green & Co. pub- 
lished a volume every Christmas for many years. 
Instead of a Lang fairy book this firm will this 
year bring out " The Book of the Blue Sea," by Mr. 



Henry Newbolt. It will be illustrated with eight 
colored plates and numerous drawings in black and 
white by Mr. Norman Wilkinson. The stories Mr. 
Newbolt has written are based on fact, being largely 
taken from the lives of naval heroes. The " Fairy 
Book Series " is now being reissued in a cheaper 
edition. 

A history of the public library of Lincoln, 
Nebraska, is given in the concluding pages of the 
current annual Report of that institution. On the 
title-page appears a view of the fine Carnegie 
building occupied by the library. Tables of sta- 
tistics show a steady decline in the percentage of 
fiction, both adult and juvenile, circulated during 
the last three years, with a corresponding gain in 
the branches of more serious reading. Like the 
average individual, the city of Lincoln is sobering 
down as it grows older. 

The eleventh volume of the '.'Cambridge History 
of English Literature," dealing with " The Early 
Georgian Era," is announced by Messrs. Putnam. 
The twelfth volume, covering the early years of the 
nineteenth century, is in the press; the concluding 
volumes (XIII. and XIV.), dealing with the Vic- 
torian Age, will be published together, as with the 
two volumes relating to the Elizabethan drama. 
Following are the contents of the forthcoming 
volume : " Edmund Burke," by Professor J. C. 
Grierson ; " Political Writers and Speakers," by 
Mr. C. W. Previte-Orton ; " Bentham and the 
Early Utilitarians," by Professor W. R. Sorley; 
" William Cowper," by Mr. Harold Child, who is 
also responsible for the chapter on " George 
Crabbe " ; " William Wordsworth," by Professor 
Emile Legouis; "Coleridge," by Mr. C. E. 
Vaughan ; " Southey," by Professor Saintsbury, 
who also deals with " Lesser Poets of the Later 
Eighteenth Century," " The Prosody of the Eight- 
eenth Century," and " The Growth of the Later 
Novel"; "Blake," by Mr. J. P. R. Wallis: 
" Burns," and " Lesser Scottish Verse," by Mr. 
T. F. Henderson; " The Georgian Drama," by Mr. 
Harold V. Routh ; " Book Production and Dis- 
tribution, 1625-1800," by Mr. H. G. Aldis; "The

This new volume in the well-known "True Biographies and Histories" series 
is the work of a writer peculiarly fitted to deal with Grant. General Charles 
King thoroughly understands the military genius of the great Union Commander, 
and gives the reader an insight into those campaigns that are used as models of 
tactics in the army colleges of Europe. But Grant, the man, and Grant, the 
President, are treated with the same regard for truth that characterizes the study 


This heroic tale will place the author 
in the front rank of the new school 
of English novelists. It is as human 
and appealing as "Tess of the D'Urber- 
villes." Janet is own sister to the 
finest heroines of Thomas Hardy, and 
the story of her great love and self- 


of Grant, the General.

Mr. Angell throws into the dust-bin the worn-out theories, the axioms of statecraft, the shibboleths

raignment of standing armies and navies and war establishments of all kinds is but another step in Mr.

The World War 

GERMANY'S SWELLED HEAD By Emil Reich 

Late Professor of International Law at the 
University of Vienna 

The purpose of this book by the late Dr. Reich, the celebrated historian and eminent authority on international 
law, is to bring to the attention of English-speaking people what the author affirms, and recent events show, is the fixed 
belief of numberless Germans namely, that Germany is the predestined head and master of the human race. Dr. 
Reich brings ample evidence to prove that this belief has long been fostered and developed by the teachings of German 
university professors, by lectures to the public, and by pamphlets and books which have had a tremendous circulation. 
The theory in its baldest form attempts to prove that most great movements in the world's history during the last two 
thousand years are of Teutonic origin; and that a vast preponderance of the world's great men during the same period 
were, if the truth were known, of Teutonic origin. As one of the deep-seated causes for Germany's vast political and 
military ambitions, this phase is well worth the careful attention of the American reader. This book of Dr. Reich's 
describes clearly, cogently, and with a wealth of startling detail, a state of affairs which will strike most of us with the 
force of an astounding revelation. i2mo. $i oo net 

IMPERIAL GERMANY By Prince Bernhard von Bulow 

Chancellor of the German Empire, 1900-1909 

This book by Prince von Biilow, who has been for forty years in the public service of his country, and who for 
nine years occupied the most important office in the German Empire, merits careful attention. It is written by the 
man who next to Bismarck and the Kaiser has had most to do with the up-building of modern Germany. It discusses 
frankly the problems of modern Germany; its industrial growth; its merchant marine; its powerful navy. It explains 
the tariff situation in Germany. It tells why Germany statesmen believe that Germany must be a first-class fighting 
power. It discusses Germany's foreign policy in the last twenty years with amazing frankness.

THE REAL ARGENTINE By J. A. Hammerton 

Mr. Hammerton's book belongs to neither of the classes into which most books about South America fall. It 
is not the enthusiastic expression of a distinguished traveller who has seen only what the governments of countries he has 
visited are willing that he should see, nor is it the sketchy description of the traveller who has flitted into and out of 
South America in haste. On the contrary, it is a dispassionate, fair account of the foremost country in South America,

A portrayal of the beauties of forest and stream that will appeal to all lovers of God'a out of doors. It will recall 
vacation wanderings to the fishermen, the hunter, and the tramper; it will make readers hungry to go to the North Woods, 
where the author used his ears and eyes to such good advantage; and it will satisfy the hunger of those who long for 
touch with the wild woods, yet are unable to make the journey except by the aid of one who to use the words of " The

Living Bread from the Fourth Gospel $1.25 net

The author, who is the General Secretary of the Presbyterian Board of Ministerial Relief and Sustentation, has 
written for his first book a unique devotional commentary upon the Fourth Gospel. A verse a day for every day in the 
year, taken in order, appears upon each page. The Scripture text is followed by a vivid epigrammatic and in many 
cases original exegesis, concluding with a brief devotional application and a prayer. 

"Living Bread from the Fourth Gospel" has been published in especially pleasing form. The volume will be 
attractive as a gift book.

In this companion volume to "The Book of God's Providence," Dr. Paris gives, simply and without argument, 
some sixty or more striking instances of answers both at home and on the mission field. The volume will be found stimu- 
lating for devotional reading, and it will prove a mine of usable material for pastors, Sunday-school teachers, and other 
religious workers. There is an introductory chapter on "Prayer as a Solvent of Difficulties," by A Veteran Pastor. 



Student Standards of Action so c net 

By Harrison Sackett Elliott and Ethel Cutler 

This is the first of a series of graded studies for Sunday-school and college students to be known as College Voluntary 
Study Courses. The general plan for the series and the detailed outline for this text have been prepared jointly by the 
Sub-committee on College Courses of the Sunday-school Council of Evangelical Denominations, and the Committee on 
Voluntary Study of the Council of North American Student Movements.

The Growth of the Christian Church $1.00 each, net 

By Robert H. Nichols, Ph.D. Professor of Church History 

Auburn Theological Seminary 

rp \r i ( Volume 1. Ancient and Medieval Christianity 

V 01UmeS\y i ume 2. Modern Christianity 

The author's preface tells the purpose of the volumes: 

" The writing of this history was undertaken at the request of the Committee on Religious Education of the General 
Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America. That committee desired a presentation of church 
history suitable for the use of classes of young people of high-school age. The book is intended for such classes, and 
makes no pretensions to do anything more than meet their needs. " 

The completeness and authoritativeness of its treatment will commend the volumes to individual readers. A 
bibliography and an index add much to the value of the work. 

The chapters on American Christianity and American Presbyterianism are especially fine. 



Intimate Letters on Personal Problems $1.25 net 

By J. R. Miller, D.D. Selected and arranged by John T. Paris, D.D. 

One of the secrets of Dr. Miller's wonderful ability to touch and mold the lives of people thousands of whom he 
never saw was his passion for letter writing. He was called a Christian Knight of the Golden Pen, because of the 
marvellous letters of helpfulness, one or more of which were written nearly every day for a generation. 

Many of those who are privileged to read these letters will feel that a personal message is coming to them, and 
pupils in life's school will gladly note the strengthening words of him who learned the secret of helpfulness from the 
Friend who was his constant companion. 



The Pew and the Pupil ?5cnet 

By Rev. R. P. D. Bennett 

His first volume, "What I Tell My Junior Congregation," was so well received that Mr. Bennett was persuaded 
to write "The Pew and the Pupil." Here in the thoughtful and convincing introductory chapters Mr. Bennett 
speaks of the need of bringing the pupil into the church, and then in thirty or more object-sermons for children he 
shows how he talks to the children of his own church. 

Like the sermons in "The Junior Congregation," these new sermons are simple and suggestive. 



By-Products of the Rural Sunday School 60c net 

By John M. Somerndike 

A book of special interest in connection with the topic for mission study during the year 1914-1915, which is "The 
Social Force of Christian Missions." 

Viewing the Sunday School as one of the greatest factors in the building of Christian character and in the evangeli- 
zation of the outlying sections of our own country, this narrative calls for a recognition of the far-reaching influence and 
results of its work. Scores of interesting illustrations are given in which the by-product of the rural Sunday School is 
seen in the permanent centres of religious education developed, the transformation of social conditions, the Christian 
workers trained, the ministers and missionaries sent forth, and in many other unexpected ways. All of these things 
are brought before the reader in an interesting manner in this our latest contribution to missionary literature. 



The Triumphant Ministry 40cnet 

By " Timothy Kilbourn " with an Introduction by 
Chas. R. Erdman, D.D. 

A gripping presentation of the life of the devoted minister of the gospel written in the form of letters from a minister 
of experience to a younger brother, who is just beginning his work. 

While this book will be of special value to all who are preparing to enter the ministry and to young ministers, it will 
be welcomed by older ministers as well, and by men and women in the church who want to know how to enter more fully 
into the life of their pastor.

ME. VACHEL LINDSAY. 

Mr. Vachel Lindsay is surely the most curi- 
ous literary figure in America. His poems 
have appeared alike in "Farm and Fireside" 
and ' ' The Yale Review. ' ' He has proclaimed 
himself at one time or another a tramp, an 
apostle of beauty, and an artist of "the Higher 
Vaudeville. ' ' He might have added that he is 
something of a " gospel-shouter. ' ' 

Chicago's interest in Mr. Lindsay was defi- 
nitely aroused last winter at the dinner given 
by "Poetry" in honor of Mr. William Butler 
Yeats. It was Mr. Yeats himself who was re- 
sponsible. He intimated that Mr. Lindsay was 
the most promising poet he had discovered in 
the United States and flatly stated of "Gen- 
eral William Booth Enters into Heaven" that 
it had ' ' an earnest simplicity, a strange beauty, 
and you know Bacon said, 'there is no excel- 
lent beauty without strangeness. ' ' ' Mr. Lind- 
say was persuaded, when he had acknowledged 
this compliment, to read a new poem, "The 
Congo." The moment was not propitious. 
The audience was already thinking how it 
could manage decently to go home. But Mr. 
Lindsay's first line caught its flagging atten- 
tion: 

" Fat black bucks in a wine-barrel room, 
Barrel-house kings, with feet unstable, 
Sagged and reeled and pounded on the table, 
Pounded on the table, 

Beat an empty barrel with the handle of a broom, 
Hard as they were able, 
Boom, boom, BOOM, 

With a silk umbrella and the handle of a broom, 
Boomlay, boomlay, boomlay, BOOM. 

Those who had never heard Mr. Lindsay be- 
fore, and they were in the majority, were a 
little excited and a good deal puzzled. Mr. 
Lindsay chanted four lines more, 

" THEN I had religion, THEN I had a vision. 
I could not turn from their revel in derision. 
THEN I SAW THE CONGO, CREEPING 

THROUGH THE BLACK, 
CUTTING THROUGH THE FOREST WITH 
A GOLDEN TRACK." 

and then, marking the rapid, syncopated 
rhythm with swaying body and jerking arms, 
he beat up his first climax in the fashion com- 
mon to exhorters of every sort : 



282 



THE DIAL 



[ Oct. 16 



" Then along that riverbank 

A thousand miles 

Tattooed cannibals danced in files ; 

Then I heard the boom of the blood-lust song 

And a thigh-bone beating on a tin-pan gong. 

And ' BLOOD ' screamed the whistles and the 
fifes of the warriors; 

' BLOOD !' screamed the skull-faced, lean witch- 
doctors, 

' Whirl ye the deadly voo-doo rattle, 

Harry the uplands. 

Steal all the cattle, 

Rattle-rattle, rattle-rattle, 

Bing. 

Boomlay, boomlay, boomlay, BOOM.' " 

That "BOOM" shook the room, but Mr. Lind- 
say chanted on, chanted of Mumbo- Jumbo, and 
all the other gods of the Congo, of the negro 
fairyland, of Jacob and the golden stairs, until : 

" There, where the wild ghost-gods had wailed 
A million boats of the angels sailed 
With oars of silver, and prows of blue 
And silken pennants that the sun shone through. 
'Twas a land transfigured, 'twas a new creation. 
Oh, a singing wind swept the negro nation 
And on through the backwoods clearing flew: 
' Mumbo- Jumbo is dead in the jungle. 
Never again will he hoo-doo you. 
Never again will he hoo-doo you.' " 

When Mr. Lindsay had finished, he was 
surrounded by women who wished to be his 
hostesses at dinner. The North Shore had dis- 
covered a lion who could roar ! The young man 
who had come up to Chicago to stay three days 
remained three weeks. 

It is altogether possible that such a triumph 
means only that those who give dinners to Mr. 
Yeats are quite as susceptible to the devices of 
vaudeville as are those who do not. But hap- 
pening in Chicago, as it did, it lends interest 
to the question which Miss Harriet Monroe, in 
introducing ' ' The Congo ' ' and the other poems 
of Mr. Lindsay's new volume, asks: how far 
does Mr. Vachel Lindsay express the Middle 
West? Miss Monroe leaves the question to 
time to decide, as must all those who feel that 
the Middle West is still very much a place and 
very little a philosophy or an emotion. Mr. 
Lindsay is not of that opinion. He feels that 
the people of the Mississippi valley can be 
' ' expressed. ' ' He thinks of their spirit as the 
spirit of New England once removed and of 
their culture as the culture of Harvard, ' ' The 
Atlantic Monthly," and, say, the Congrega- 
tional Church, modified only by a somewhat 
freer manner and gesture. The Middle West 
Mr. Lindsay knows best might be better rep- 
resented by a state university, ' ' The Outlook, ' ' 
and Methodism, but that substitution would 



probably exaggerate the difference, in Mr. 
Lindsay 's mind, between it and New England. 
Mr. Lindsay 's own statement may be found in 
one of his proclamations in "Farm and Fire- 
side," or perhaps better, in his apostrophe to 
Kansas in his "Adventures while Preaching 
the Gospel of Beauty, ' ' from which we quote : 

" Kansas, the Ideal American Community ! Kan- 
sas, nearer than any other to the kind of a land 
our fathers took for granted ! Kansas, practically 
free from cities and industrialism, the real last 
refuge of the constitution, since it maintains the 
type of agricultural civilization the constitution 
had in mind! Kansas, State of tremendous crops 
and hardy, devout, natural men ! . . . Kansas of the 
Chautauqua and the college student and the devout 
school-teacher! The dry State, the automobile 
State, the insurgent State! Kansas, that is ruled 
by the cross-roads church and the church type of 
civilization ! The Newest New England ! State of 
more promise of permanent spiritual glory than 
Massachusetts in her brilliant youth!" 

The attitude here so directly stated in prose 
is implicit in Mr. Lindsay's poems. He has 
been familiar enough with the moving-picture 
theatre to write verses celebrating the charms 
of Miss Blanche Sweet and Miss Mary Pick- 
ford ; he has been enough affected by contem- 
porary sociology to write poems on the white 
slave and one, at least, on the proletariat ; and 
he has written in praise of a dancer, 

" With foot like the snow, and with step like 
the rain." 

But these interests have come easily enough, 
without seriously modifying the man within. 
His vocabulary, his images, his rhythms, his 
moral bias all these go directly back to the 
camp-meeting which was so familiar an ex- 
pression of Middle Western emotion a genera- 
tion ago. We do not need to be told that Mr. 
Lindsay has lived in a house with a summer- 
kitchen in the rear, a base-burner in the 
middle, and furniture of black walnut and 
hair-cloth in the front. It is perfectly certain 
that the margin by which he became a poet 
and not a revivalist was of the narrowest. 
Could anything be more representative of the 
Middle West that was ? 

To grant Mr. Lindsay his representativeness 
does not, of course, grant him his expressive- 
ness. It may be that his escape from the ex- 
horter's platform is only temporary. Many 
of his poems are spoiled by what Mr. Yeats 
would call "moral fervour." Many more are 
marred by an ill-chosen word or a badly man- 
aged line. But Mr. Lindsay has a novel talent, 
even a poetical talent. The man who wrote

' ' General William Booth Enters into Heaven, " 
where 

" The banjos rattled and the tambourines 

Jing-jing-jingled in the hands of Queens," 
and "The Congo" whether it is called 
"Higher Vaudeville" or a daring experiment 
has poetry in him, even if he has not per- 
fectly learned how to bring it out. Indeed, 
we could hardly say less of Mr. Lindsay if we 
had seen only the first lines of his poem to 
John P. Altgeld, which begins : 
" Sleep softly . . . eagle forgotten . . . under the 

stone. 
Time has its way with you there, and the clay 

has its own." 

He may cease to grow as a poet. He may have 
gone as far as he will ever go. In that case he 
will never be held to have expressed the emo- 
tion of the Middle West. But we do not know 
a young man of any more promise than Mr. 
Vachel Lindsay for the task which he seems to 
have set himself. 



NEW TENDENCIES IN FRENCH 
POETRY. 



M. Romain Holland says in " Jean Chris- 
tophe" that, when a Frenchman has ideas, he 
always wants to impress them upon others. It 
does not seem quite fair to limit this quality to 
Frenchmen, when the Germans are well known 
for their didacticism and proselytism, and no 
one supposes that their present resort to the 
fields of arms means that they have perma- 
nently abandoned the field of ideas. Nor is 
there any lack of the desire to convert among 
other nations. Every artistic revolution is a 
matching of ideas against ideas, of wits 
against wits. Every new aesthetic creed is 
fought for by its followers with all the dia- 
lectic and stylistic forces at their command. 
But the distinguishing feature of the French- 
man with ideas is his faculty of coining terms 
in which these ideas are crystallized with 
a fair degree of finality. The alertness and 
acumen displayed by the French in their criti- 
cal fencing-bouts have not been lost upon 
other nations. On the whetstone of French 
criticism the theorists and the critics of the 
world have sharpened their wits and their 
words. For, every controversy that has en- 
gaged the attention and the interest of those 
in touch with French letters has left a legacy 
of epithets and phrases so striking and timely, 
so suggestive and illuminating, that they have 
become valuable elements of the vocabulary of 
other literatures. In this respect, at least, 
French criticism is unrivalled. 



Within the last twenty-five years a score of 
aesthetic movements has sprung up in the ever 
active intellectual atmosphere of France. They 
form an appalling procession of ' ' isms. ' ' Upon 
impressionism and symbolism, realism and 
naturalism, which the progressive young gen- 
eration is already likely to be classing with 
"archaisms," has followed a long line of 
secessionist groups of poets, some so closely 
allied as to be barely distinguishable, others 
of striking dissimilarity, and most of them not 
nearly so new as their names would imply. 
For they can be reduced to the two main cur- 
rents that have alternately determined the 
direction of literary development all over the 
world: the one, artistic and inclining toward 
an art for art's sake; the other, social and 
insisting upon an art springing from and 
appealing to real life. It would not be diffi- 
cult to conceive them as the aesthetic formulas 
of the eternal conflict between the ideal and 
the real. 

Of this bewildering abundance of ideas and 
their champions, some merit more than passing 
mention because they are distinctly sympto- 
matic of the general intellectual ferment and 
unrest of our time. The revolt against con- 
ventions frequently recurs. M. Albert Londres 
is the father of " eff reneisme, " which is a 
poetical protest against the measured and 
moderate sentiments of life and letters: he 
would have the poet seek a state of breathless 
exaltation. Yet the following specimen of his 
own poetry is in the same measured lines and 
symmetrical rhymes that French verse has 
known since the days of Boileau, nor is its 
emotional intensity of the degree he aspires to : 

" Va, marche devant toi, jeune homme, mon pareil, 
Et du haut du perron ou frappe le soleil, 

Salue amplement cette terre. 
Puis descends les gradins que ta race a montes 
Cours meler ta jeunesse aux luttes des cites, 

Sois ' puissant,' mais plus ' solitaire.' " 

M. Edmond Thiaudiere, the author of 
"Notes d'un pessimiste," has the courage to 
face an age which had acclaimed the gospel of 
"beyond good or evil" with his ideal of 
' ' bonisme, ' ' a worship of goodness which he 
would make the philosophy of philosophies, 
the religion of religions, not only in theory, 
but in practice. M. Max Jacob has studied 
the racial ancestry of the French and dis- 
covered in the old Druid liturgies the origin 
of French poetic traditions. He traces the 
close kinship between Druid mysticism and 
Hindu metaphysics and has constructed an 
aesthetic system which he calls "druidisme." 
M. Andre Billy seeks to express the syn- 
thetical features of our life by an aesthetic 
code under the term "totalisme." Concerned 



284 



THE DIAL 



[ Oct. 16 



with protecting the spiritual boundaries of 
the nation's culture, M. F. Jean-Desthieux's 
"patriartisme" seems to be a brother in 
aesthetics to political nationalism. Signor 
Lenzi, a progressive Italian, has been preach- 
ing in France the doctrine of " philopresen- 
taneisme. ' ' It advocates a life of pure instinct, 
centering in the present moment, without 
forethought or afterthought. M. Adrien 
Mithouard has conceived the colossal idea of 
"plurisme," which is to convey not a succes- 
sion of impressions, but their collective simul- 
taneous manifestation. The theory has been 
promptly adopted by M. H.-M. Barzun, who 
has elaborated it into " simultaneisme, " and 
an artist is said to be applying it in his paint- 
ings, which are to inaugurate the new school 
of "synchronisme." Dating back to 1896, an 
almost venerable age in our period of rapid 
transit in life as in letters, " democratisme " 
has run its course in art and art magazines; 
recently, however, it developed into "prole- 
tairisme. ' ' 

To the nephew of Oscar Wilde, Mr. Arthur 
Cravan, is due the credit of having applied to 
poetical production the philosophy of ' ' plural- 
isme," of which M. J. H. Rosny the elder is 
a brilliant representative. Goethe had sung 
the conflict of his dual soul. Mr. Cravan 
sings the disturbing manifestations of his 
plural soul. Conscious of being identical with 
all things, all human creatures and all ani- 
mals, he also desires ubiquity and wishes that 
he could gobble (bdfrer) all the tempting 
dishes on the world 's menus and that he could 
possess all women a monstrous capacity of 
imagination! Mr. Cravan has also invented 
the term "machinisme," which very appro- 
priately characterizes the mechanical and in- 
dustrial side of our life. The term has not 
found wide usage, however, perhaps because 
its rival, "dynamisme," is more euphonious. 
Since M. A.-M. Gossez, the author of an in- 
tensely interesting volume of verse, entitled 
"La mauvaise aventure" (which, however, 
gives no inkling of his sympathy with the 
new poetic ideal and is an admirable achieve- 
ment on less heretical lines), delivered a lec- 
ture on "Le dynamisme poetique" in Rouen 
four years ago, the term has frequently ap- 
peared in the columns of literary magazines. 
The same year M. Henri Guilbeaux, lecturing 
before audiences in Germany, said : 

" So far poetry has been static ; now it is and 
should be dynamic. The naturalistic writers have 
given art realism and pleinairism; the new writers 
are introducing movement and power." 

The arguments in favor of this new de- 
parture sound rather convincing. The new 
rhythm of our modern life, the shocks to 



which our sensibilities are daily exposed, have 
profoundly modified our organism. The eye 
accustomed to electric light can no longer see 
sunlight and color as it did before; the ear 
has adjusted itself to the din and the clatter 
of metropolitan traffic and has become attuned 
to another world of consonance and disso- 
nance. Hence, in letters, art, and music, other 
standards are bound to impose themselves 
upon the critic who would keep abreast of 
the time in reducing these manifestations to 
eesthetie formulas. M. Guilbeaux, seeing these 
changes taking place throughout the world, 
argues that the new spirit of the time requires 
for its expression a new form, since the old 
medium cannot hold the old message. He 
breaks out into this prophecy : 

"A new Gothic age is on the way, an age of 
engineers, architects, Herculean rhapsodist? a 
race of autochthones, athletic, continental, as Walt 
Whitman said." 

The new poetry, in its verse-like rhythm, must 
reflect the inner rhythm, must correspond 
exactly to the very thrills of our thoughts and 
feelings. The language must have consistence, 
must be based upon a popular and technical 
vocabulary, and must be simple and solid like a 
piece of concrete work. The density of words 
is more important than their sonority. The 
style must approach that of the old heroic 
epic, inasmuch as this poetry is to glorify 
stupendous mechanical structures and the 
heroic mechanical activity of the present. The 
poet must forego all refinement of intellectual- 
ism and artistry and endeavor to be sane and 
simple and strong. Nor is this new poetry 
intended to be read in the solitude of the 
individual sanctuary or at the symposia of 
the initiated. On the contrary, rooted as it 
is in the real life of the real people, its appeal 
is primarily to the mass of the people, and it 
should be chanted in the manner of ancient 
rhapsodists before large congregations. Con- 
trary to symbolism and art for art's sake, 
which have run their gamut and ended in 
subtle abstractions and orphic obscurities, 
dynamism is meant to record the rhythms of 
real life, to translate into verse of corre- 
sponding form the formidable power of the 
proletariat, the forces fermenting and seething 
in the metropolitan furnace, the daily turmoil 
of traffic, the fever of speculation, the hunger 
for success, all the longing of the great living 
mass of humanity. 

There seems little doubt that Walt Whit- 
man is the spiritual father of M. Guilbeaux 's 
poetic ideal. The German poets quoted as 
dynamic are among those who hold high the 
memory of the great American poet. They are 
Richard Dehmel, Johannes Schlaf, Arno Holz,

Karl Henckell, Alfons Paquet, Wilhelm 
Schmidtbonn, and others. The French poets 
enrolled in this group are the late Henri 
Franck, Andre Spire, Phileas Lebesgue, Pierre 
Hamp, Nicolas Beauduin, A.-M. Gossez, and 
the dramatist Henri Martin Barzun. M. Guil- 
beaux refuses to consider futurism a "mod- 
ern ' ' movement an amusing paradox 
because its eulogy of war is untimely ! 

M. Guilbeaux 's mission was for some time 
until war was declared that of a literary 
mediator between the two countries. He 
wrote on German letters for French reviews 
and on French writers for German magazines. 
He recently published a very remarkable an- 
thology of contemporary German verse. M. 
Guilbeaux is an enthusiast and an idealist 
with whom every self-chosen task becomes a 
labor of love. No little feeling went into the 
compilation and the translation of the poems 
collected under the title "Anthologie des 
lyriques allemands contemporains depuis 
Nietzsche." The book is dedicated to Guil- 
beaux 's friend, M. Leon Bazalgette, the biog- 
rapher and translator of Whitman, and to 
Herr Stefan Zweig, the German translator 
and champion of M. Verhaeren. M. Ver- 
haeren himself supplies the preface and sees 
in the undertaking far more than a literary 
achievement. For Guilbeaux is to him a rep- 
resentative of that new Europe which is to be 
built, not upon the conceptions of the past, but 
upon the realities of the present, and to bring 
close to each other nations separated by arti- 
ficial and fictitious barriers. One may be 
permitted to wonder how much faith in that 
new Europe now remains to M. Verhaeren. 

M. Guilbeaux 's attitude toward modern 
poetry was vaguely foreshadowed in his first 
book of verse, " Berlin-feuillets d'un soli- 
taire," which was published five years ago. 
Prolonged residence in the German capital, 
the most "American" of all German cities, 
had attuned his ear to the cacophonies of 
metropolitan life and adjusted his vision to 
the shifting scenes of the moving panorama 
about him. He began to realize their aesthetic 
possibilities and, watching the crowds at the 
"Stettiner Bahnhof," wrote in his notebook: 
" La gare est le temple moderne, 

Ou j 'adore exultant le coeur vibrant des trains; 

Mon ame aime a flaner au long des quais en fievre, 

Ou Fame de la foule immensement tessaile . . ." 

Specimens from a volume of "Hymnes et 
psaumes" which he is preparing for publica- 
tion have from time to time appeared in print, 
and suggest that since the publication of his 
first book, he found his masters in Whitman 
and M. Verhaeren. But although they may 
stand sponsors for his work, it distinctly re- 



flects an individuality which, after all, is bound 
to go its own way. 

In M. Nicolas Beauduin, the editor of "La 
Vie des Lettres," dynamic poetry has found 
another earnest champion. Not contented 
with opening the columns of his magazine to 
this new secession, he has made the following 
statement in a recent issue of "Le Mercure de 
France": 

" The dogma of impossibility, the hieratic atti- 
tude, the mathematical meter, the conventional 
rhythms, in a word, the ' static ' quality, shall be 
succeeded by the dynamics of motion, by dynamic 
aesthetics, truer than the other, because, rooted in 
reality, more identical with the life of things." 

M. Beauduin not only seconds Guilbeaux in 
theoretical propaganda, but applies the new 
aesthetic code to his own poetical production. 
His seven "Poemes paroxystes a la gloire de 
Paris moderne" are an amazing performance. 
Never before has the soul of a city been sung 
in accents so intense, so vibrant, so quivering 
and throbbing with the very nerves and pulses 
of living and striving millions : 

" Geante Cite, debout sur 1'univers, 
Toi qui hausses au ciel vaincu ta Tour de Fer 
Comme un symbole de victoire . . ." 

The poems contain many striking images and 
eloquent lines, among them the following : 

" Tu n'es pas celle qui sommeille, 
Mais 1'instable, la paroxyste qui fait saigner 
Et sans fin renouvelle 
Un desir imprevu 

Qui pousse hors du formalisme et du connu, 
Hors du cercle glace et neutre des routines, 
Vers une creation plus neuve et plus divine." 

If the spirit of this poetry reflects the read- 
ing of life which young France has evolved 
out of the chaos of conflicting ideas, it would 
augur a wonderful Gallic renaissance. For 
"La Vie des Lettres" is not the only maga- 
zine that sounds this new note in philosophy, 
letters, and art. It has a most valiant little 
contemporary in "L 'Effort Libre," which is 
edited by Leon Bazalgette, Jean Richard 
Bloch, Andre Spire, and others, and covers an 
even wider area of vital topics. Quiet workers 
they all are, ignoring all so-called literary 
coteries and in turn ignored by them. Perhaps 
the new spirit that they express and the new 
form in which it is manifesting itself are not 
wholly new to those who can read the harmo- 
nies of the great hymn of life up and down and 
recognize, not only the tune soaring above, but 
the mighty organ-point sounding below. For 
they hear through it all the keynote of ideal 
democracy and trace the pedigree of the 
"dynamic" poets and their brethren the 
great Verhaeren included to Walt Whitman.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



THE LEARNED PASTIMES OF AN EMPEROR 6X- 

eite in the general public an interest wholly 
out of proportion to their real importance. 
To see the potentates of this world engaging 
in pursuits that bring them for the time being 
down to the plane of those not born in the 
purple seems to exercise a peculiar fascination 
on the beholder. Diocletian, living in unos- 
tentatious seclusion for nine years and amus- 
ing himself with the cultivation of his garden, 
makes an intimate appeal that is not felt in 
contemplating the same Diocletian celebrating 
with Maximian his splendid triumph over the 
enemies of Rome in Asia, Africa, Britain, and 
Germany. "I wish you would come to Sa- 
lona," he writes to his colleague from his 
retirement, "and see the cabbages I have 
planted: you would never again mention to 
me the name of empire. ' ' Mr. Richard Norton, 
who was last year pleasantly introduced by 
his father (see the "Letters" of Charles Eliot 
Norton) to a wide circle of readers in con- 
nection with his work as Director of the 
American School of Classical Studies at 
Rome, and who has extended his archaeological 
researches to Greece as well, describes in a 
recent newspaper article some of the German 
Emperor's holiday diversions at Corfu, where, 
as patron of Greek archaeology, he is causing 
certain important excavations to be made. 
"It is perhaps at Corfu," writes Mr. Norton, 
"that he has shown most clearly that he 
enjoys the paths of pleasantness and peace. 
There, week after week, each spring for sev- 
eral years now, he has lived above the town in 
the villa built by the late Empress of Austria, 
or else in the lovely harbor on his private 
steamship, the Hohenzollern. ... He is accom- 
panied by no pomp and state, but only by a 
very small necessary staff and by one or more 
famous scholars. Of these the most familiar 
is Dorpfeld, the architect and excavator of 
world-wide fame. He probably enjoys getting 
up every morning by six and getting to the 
site of the Greek temple (where the Kaiser's 
excavations are) by eight, but the official staff 
find it a trial to their devotion. Yet this is 
what the Kaiser does day after day. He not 
only goes early, but he stays till six, when the 
workmen go home, and only takes a couple of 
hours out for lunch and siesta. His excite- 
ment when anything is turned up is delight- 
ful to see. Last spring, when a bas-relief 
showing an utterly unknown and unsuspected 
form of ancient Greek armor was found, his 
understanding of it was complete, and his 
comparisons with mediaeval armor showed 



great knowledge. When nothing much is 
happening, he has been seen sitting for an 
hour on a pile of earth, swapping stories with 
one of his American friends." Worthy of 
notice at this time is the pen picture thus 
drawn by one who has met familiarly the 
"war lord" of Europe and has talked with 
him on matters of art and archaeology of com- 
mon interest to the two. 



HOMERIC NODDINGS have, ever since Homer's 
time, given welcome occasion to men of less 
than Homeric greatness to air their little 
stock of learning and to swell themselves up 
with the conceit of vast superiority to genius. 
In reading the incomparable Omar quatrains 
of FitzGerald's shaping, a small critic might 
take exception to certain images and phrases, 
and thus tickle himself with a sense of superi- 
ority to the Woodbridge poet and philosopher. 
For instance, in stanza sixty-seven, the famous 
likening of hell to "the shadow from a soul 
on fire, cast on the darkness" might cause 
trouble to a literal-minded reader, who would 
perhaps be tempted to ask: How can a fire 
cast a shadow on darkness? An opaque object 
between the fire and a surface illuminated by 
it would cast a shadow on that surface; but 
to speak of a fire as projecting its shadow on 
an unilluminated void is nonsense. Long- 
fellow's image of "footprints on the sands of 
time" has excited the derision of many a 
prosaic soul; for how, it is asked, can any- 
thing like permanence be associated with such 
footprints? The same storm that threw the 
forlorn and shipwrecked brother on to those 
sands would obliterate the supposed impres- 
sions. How often the self-constituted critic 
of literary masterpieces feels himself tempted 
to reconstruct certain lines that distress his 
small soul by reason of their fancied imper- 
fections! For example, when Browning, in 
"Rabbi Ben Ezra," bids us "rejoice we are 
allied to that which doth provide and not 
partake, effect and not receive," the stickler 
for perfect antithesis is unhappy until he has 
substituted ' ' bestow " f or " effect. ' ' And the 
last line of Emerson's "Sursum Corda" 
' ' For only it can absolutely deal ' ' disturbs 
the serenity of him who claims to know better 
than the poet himself what meaning he in- 
tended to convey; for the dominant idea, 
argues this pestilent person, is not that heaven 
alone is capable of absolute dealing, but that 
heaven deals absolutely or not at all, and 
hence the line should read : ' * For it can only 
absolutely deal." Evidently our emendator 
of masterpieces is an absolute person, and so 
here we leave him to the merited nemesis his 
pedantic practices are preparing for him.

A MODIFICATION OF SHERMAN'S DEFINITION 

OF WAR arrests the attention in Mr. Simeon 
Strunsky's "Post-Impressions." In fact the 
modification is so radical as to amount to a 
re-definition. To quote from the mirth-pro- 
voking Mr. Strunsky: "War is love. It is 
the brotherhood of man. Here, for instance, 
the races of India have been clamoring for 
self-government, and in vain. But all at once 
England confers on her Indian subjects a 
privilege infinitely greater than the right of 
voting for aldermen and district magistrates. 
England has admitted her Indian subjects to 
the fundamental democracy of the rifle and 
the bayonet. But if Sikhs and Gurkhas and 
Turcos are good enough to fight with white 
men against white men, they will soon con- 
sider themselves good enough to vote with 
white men against other white men, or to vote 
for themselves against all white men. But 
for the time being the little races and the 
oppressed races must be rather put out at 
the vast outpouring of love that threatens to 
engulf them. It is all so sudden ; and so per- 
plexing. When the Great White Czar dis- 
covered how close to his heart are the Jews, 
and Poles, and Finns, he did not stop there. 
He immediately conferred on them the priv- 
ilege of marching to the frontier and dying 
for him. Could love ask more ? You will now 
recognize the true grandeur of the great 
European conflict. It is the gospel of love 
preached on a magnificent scale. It has taught 
the monarchs not only to love their own sub- 
jects, but to love and cherish each other's 
subjects. ' ' And in this carnival of love lavish- 
ing itself in all directions we may expect ere 
long to see further interesting developments. 
" In a few years, when there will be a shifting 
of partners and England and Germany are 
lined up against Russia, France, and Austria, 
the new combinations of Powers will be in a 
position to love new combinations of small 
races and peoples. So that after two or three 
European wars every Power will have had a 
chance to love and be loved by every weak 
and oppressed race in the two hemispheres." 
To the author of this excellent fooling thanks 
are due for a brief respite from the horrors 
and the nameless anxieties aroused by the 
titanic struggle in Europe. 


DUCK-BACK READERS, as someone has styled 
those non-absorbers of literary matter who 
emerge from the end of a volume as little 
conversant with its contents as when they 
plunged in at the beginning, seem to differ 
from other readers more than in a mere 
matter of degree, although no reader retains 
everything that passes under his eyes in print. 



Indiscriminate inclusiveness is characteristic 
of the reading of many duck-backs, and others 
there are who, restricting their range, read 
and re-read the same books with as little in- 
tellectual or spiritual result. In this class 
belongs the person who forms the habit of 
going through Boswell's "Johnson" once a 
year, but is never heard to quote a word of 
the great man or known to display any of 
his wisdom. Would a thorough mastery of 
any book admit of its annual perusal in course 
thereafter with patience or profit? Perhaps 
so, but certainly not for all readers, and still 
more certainly not for all books. In an article 
on "Teaching English," in the current "Yale 
Review," Professor Henry Seidel Canby 
shows us the non-assimilative college student, 
who reads without understanding and comes 
out of a course in the great authors by the 
same door wherein he went, uninstructed, un- 
stimulated, uninspired. ' ' In truth, ' ' confesses 
the writer, " it is depressing to sit in a recita- 
tion room, estimating, while someone recites, 
and your voice is resting, the volume and the 
flow of the stream of literary instruction 
washing over the undergraduates ; and then 
to see them bob up to the surface at the end of 
the hour, seemingly as impervious as when 
their heads went under." One of these im- 
pervious undergraduates is quoted as answer- 
ing an examination question on the character 
of Justice Shallow in this wise: "Justice 
Shallow seems to be a jolly old man who loves 
company, and who would do anything to 
please his guests." The obvious truth of the 
matter is that though the duck-back reader 
has learned to follow the printed lines from 
left to right, often at a high rate of speed, he 
has never really learned to read. 



A HOLOCAUST OF PRECIOUS MANUSCRIPTS IS 

one of the minor crimes to be forever sadly 
remembered in connection with the mon- 
strously greater crime of the present incred- 
ible European conflagration. The Louvain 
tragedy is, of course, here referred to the 
wanton destruction of literary treasure that 
is now being regretfully recalled to mind and 
appraised by the bibliographers and biblio- 
philes of all nations, but of one community of 
letters. It appears that, in addition to its 
priceless collection of printed works, the uni- 
versity library was fortunate almost from the 
first in possessing ancient manuscripts of great 
value. A catalogue of these published in 1641 
enumerates forty-two, and more than two hun- 
dred others were afterward unearthed from 
obscure corners or otherwise added to the list. 
We read of a folio manuscript volume con- 
taining the chronicles of the dukes of Brabant 



288 



THE DIAL 



[ Oct. 16 



from 1260 to 1555; of "Annales des Pays- 
Bas" from Pepin's time to the year 1752; of 
a sixteenth-century chronicle of Diest contain- 
ing the charter of the liberties of that city ; of 
the "Fasti Academiae Louvainensis, " giving 
lists of the various faculties of the university ; 
of a chronicle of Utrecht, in verse, of the year 
1461; and of a curious Brabantian manu- 
script with colored illustrations of horsemen 
engaged in battle. Also a copy of the "Car- 
mina" of Prudentius is mentioned, in small 
folio form and written on parchment in a style 
that assigns it to the ninth century; and 
there were beautiful copies of Horace, Lucan, 
Ovid, Cicero, and other classical writers. 
Manuscript Bibles and liturgies and a parch- 
ment "Book of Hours" in Gothic characters 
of rare beauty, are further treasures that fell 
a prey to the flames. We make no mention 
here of the printed books that were burned, 
many of them irreplaceable and beyond price. 
A modern American public library is capable 
of rising from its ashes in a few months, re- 
newed in vigor; but what resurrection can 
there ever be for such a library as that of 
Louvain University ? 

* 

CULTURE AMONG THE TAGALOGS, before the 
Spanish conquest, reached a degree of develop- 
ment seldom credited to those primitive 
dwellers in our far-eastern island possessions. 
Significant evidence of the persistence of that 
culture long after the Spaniards had taken 
possession of the Philippines is found in a 
manuscript volume lately presented to the 
Philippine Library by Governor-General Har- 
rison. It is a collection of land deeds and 
transfer contracts, and was used, with other 
documents, in establishing the rightful owner- 
ship of the friar lands some years ago. In 
the monthly "Bulletin" of the above-named 
library is printed a description of the volume, 
which is "bound stoutly in carabao hide" and 
is entitled: "Libro C de las escrituras de las 
tierras de Bifian pertenecientes al Colegio de 
Santo Tomas. " The papers it contains bear 
dates ranging from 1624 to 1738. We learn 
further: "The volume contains interesting 
material for study for the lawyer, as well as 
for the investigator of historical details con- 
cerning the form in which land transactions 
in the Philippines were made in that remote 
time, the manner in which declarations in 
respect to the same were executed, and the 
paper, kind of characters written, way of evi- 
dencing, etc., used in former time, in this 
country. Another interesting fact in these 
documents is that some of them are signed in 
the ancient Tagalog characters, although they 
were executed at a time when those signing 



had already adopted names and titles in ac- 
cordance with the ideas imported into the 
Islands by the Spaniards. Nevertheless the 
natives continued to use those characters, even 
though they wrote them from left to right 
. . . instead of writing them from top to 
bottom, as was formerly the custom." Dear 
to the most untutored savage is the language 
of his fathers, and dear, too, are the characters 
in which that language finds some sort of 
written expression. 



A FAMOUS "MARK TWAIN" CHARACTER, im- 
mortalized in "Roughing It" both in the 
story and in its dedication and an especial 
favorite of the great humorist in his Nevada 
mining days, died near the end of last month 
at Greenville, California. In the true "Mark 
Twain" spirit of hopeful adventure, Calvin H. 
Higbie, a civil engineer by profession and a 
miner for precious metals by circumstance 
and preference, had made and lost at least 
one considerable fortune before death over- 
took him. That he was a man capable of 
appreciating the peculiar genius of his gifted 
friend appears from the few lines he con- 
tributed, at Mr. Albert Bigelow Paine 's re- 
quest, to the latter 's biography of "Mark 
Twain." Describing Sam Clemens 's unre- 
strained enjoyment of the pleasures of a " great 
ball " in a newly opened pavilion at Aurora, he 
writes : "In changing partners, whenever he 
saw a hand raised he would grasp it with great 
pleasure and sail off into another set, ob- 
livious to his surroundings. Sometimes he 
would act as though there were no use in 
trying to go right or to dance like other 
people, and with his eyes closed he would do 
a hoe-down or a double-shuffle all alone, talk- 
ing to himself and saying that he never 
dreamed there was so much pleasure to be 
obtained at a ball. It was all as natural as a 
child's play. By the second set, all the ladies 
were falling over themselves to get him for 
a partner, and most of the crowd, too full of 
mirth to dance, were standing or sitting 
around, dying with laughter." To have been 
partner and chum to "Mark Twain," and to 
have won immortality in his pages, is surely 
not to have lived in vain. 



THE LITERARY CRITIC 's LIMITED AUDIENCE is 

one not to be despised. Of far more influence 
and respectability is it than the unnumbered 
thousands that drive to their capacity the 
presses of the popular magazines. In Pro- 
fessor Bliss Perry's second paper on American 
literary criticism, in "The Yale Review" for 
October, he finds occasion to say: "Take the 
fact of the limited audience. No matter how 



1914]

289 



limited we think it is to-day, it was certainly 
more limited still in 1836, when Emerson de- 
clared that we had no critic, and Poe set him- 
self doggedly, month after month, in the 
'Southern Literary Messenger,' to demon- 
strate that there was at least one critic to be 
reckoned with. And how much this inde- 
fatigable advocate of the determinate prin- 
ciples of criticism accomplished at his lonely 
post! With better health, and better temper, 
and with that broader and deeper culture 
which was denied to him, what might not this 
theorist and craftsman have done for Ameri- 
can criticism, in spite of the small circle of 
subscribers to the 'Messenger,' and in spite of 
the indifference of the general public! The 
American critic of to-day who can enunciate 
a principle or record with delicacy and beauty 
and absolute honesty a critical verdict for a 
few thousand readers in THE DIAL, 'The 
Nation,' the 'Yale Eeview,' need not worry 
about the limits of his audience. It is the 
small audience that is the vital, the respon- 
sive, the propagating audience." The con- 
scientious critic 's prayer is ever that of Milton 
in his petition for a fit audience, though few. 


EDUCATIONAL USE OF THE PICTURE POST CARD 
is exemplified in the issue of these inex- 
pensive art products by the staid and con- 
servative British Museum to call popular 
attention to its resources, including its library. 
Necessarily it is but a few of that library's 
three and one-half million volumes that can 
thus be advertised, but these chosen few are 
well worth the trouble and expense involved. 
For example, the famous Gutenberg Bible is 
pictured for a penny to many an interested 
person who will be glad to take the hint and 
get sight of the volume itself; a page from 
an early Caxton is reproduced in facsimile; 
the Greek fragment known as "The Sayings 
of Jesus" is similarly photo-engraved, and 
Nelson 's last letter to Lady Hamilton, and the 
earliest map of New York, known as "The 
Duke's Plan," showing the topography of the 
town in 1661 ; also the title-page to the 
Shakespeare First Folio, and the first known 
map of the British Isles, from Ptolemy's 
" Cosmographia. " The Oxford University 
Press, expert in this species of art printing, 
manufactures some, if not all, of these picture 
cards, which are described as collotypes of an 
excellent quality. Numerous other objects of 
interest besides books and manuscripts are 
made to contribute to the variety and beauty 
and instructiveness of this set of post cards, 
and no museum could well have more or 
better material to draw from for this purpose 
than the one at Bloomsbury. 



THE LIBRARY-USER'S PROFITABLE INVEST- 
MENT, the large returns he is permitted to 
enjoy from a very small outlay, one finds 
emphasized more and more in the library re- 
ports from all parts of the country. Partly 
responsible for this, no doubt, is the efficiency 
expert, who is directing public attention to the 
ratio between results achieved and energy ex- 
pended in all departments of activity. From 
Galesburg there comes to hand the annual 
record of things attempted and things done by 
the public library of that enlightened com- 
munity, and in this record is to be noted the 
librarian 's justifiable satisfaction in reminding 
the Galesburghers at what a ridiculously small 
cost something less than one mill a day for 
each inhabitant they are privileged to have 
the run of a book-collection worth nearly 
forty-five thousand dollars, and files of cur- 
rent periodicals aggregating four hundred 
and fifty dollars yearly in value. "Has any 
taxpayer in this city," asks the librarian in 
conclusion, "invested any money that has 
brought him in returns of a like proportion? 
The Library has no cause to be ashamed of 
its record ; it compares favorably with that of 
many libraries having more funds and more 
books. When the time comes for our income 
to be increased, we can do proportionately 
more ; the difficulty does not lie in not know- 
ing of things to do to extend the work, but in 
being able financially to do them." 



COMMUNICATIONS. 



EMEESON'S JOURNALS. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In your issue of August 16 appears an unsigned 
review of Emerson's Journals that is scholarly in 
temper but unintentionally unfair in treatment 
unfair to Emerson and also to his editors due, 
probably, to a lack of interest in the Sphinx of 
American writers and hence a lack of thorough- 
ness in a study of the Journals. 

The reviewer says that " these Journals empha- 
size the fact that he is not eminently a diarist." 
Farther on he remarks: "Unlike other diarists, 
he never shoAvs himself for a moment in undress." 
It seems to me that as Amiel attempts to show 
himself in undress in a subjective way a way 
which he himself says did not reveal the better 
part of him a way that almost overcame Matthew 
Arnold's interest in Amiel as a critic, Emerson 
shows himself in his journals in an objective way 
in a truly Shakespearean way. As he said of 
Shakespeare, so, paraphrasing his words, can it be 
said of his Journals : the only biographer of Emer- 
son is Emerson. And as it has been said of his 
poet, so can it almost be said of his effort in the 
Journals : " He never stoops to be his own ex- 
positor in violation of nature." His Journals rep-

resented largely his effort to express men and things 
objectively to himself. Because there is no egotism 
in the effort, and rarely any consciousness of his 
self-conscious admirers and critics, he reveals him- 
self as he is with all his limitations as well as with 
a new variety of appeal that makes his Journals 
to me the most remarkable and the most faithful 
of any that ever came under my notice. 

The reviewer says of the editors that their notes 
of facts are " often dryly concise " and that their 
comments " rarely reveal much of the author." It 
seems to me they are never dry are always 
illuminating, especially as to his western lecture 
tours in the fifties and sixties. I do not agree with 
the editors regarding the seer's interest in Delia 
Bacon, but their note is interesting, is neither brief 
nor dry, and is intended to be revealing. Perhaps 
it is. Certainly they are qualified to speak in ways 
no one else is. 

The reviewer gives a third of his space to an 
extract from the tenth volume, describing Haw- 
thorne's funeral and Emerson's comments on it 
and on the man as author and neighbor. A noble 
use of the space! But why not give a line, men- 
tioning from the same volume Emerson's descrip- 
tion of the camping expedition to a mountain near 
Troy, N. H. ? The mountain climbing, the pano- 
rama, the wild storm, the savage shelter, are each 
vividly described. What an adventure for our 
aged closet-student! Methinks John Burroughs 
would mention it were he re-writing his fascinating 
Emerson essay or, at least, make a comment on 
the " Fringilla nivalis"! This record is more re- 
freshing than that in an early volume where he tells 
day by day of a tramp for some ninety miles with 
his brothers. 

Or why not mention the record in this tenth 
volume, made at Washington, Iowa, February 13, 
1867 ? We are forcibly reminded of the severity 
of the weather, the scarcity of railroads, and of 
privations and pioneers. No doubt there are still 
living in the states he visited that year Illinois, 
Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Minnesota, and Wiscon- 
sin people who heard him lecture, and who, had 
our reviewer mentioned this record, would have 
been tempted to add this most interesting volume 
to their library treasures. 

Emerson's limitation, as revealed by the Journals, 
is most conspicuous in his inability to appreciate 
Daniel Webster's integrity after the " Seventh of 
March Speech " and Lincoln's statesmanship prior 
to the Proclamation of Emancipation. He does 
not mention Lincoln until 1862, despite the fact 
that he visited Springfield, Illinois, almost annually 
for ten years previous and was there the year of 
the famous debates. There is much meat in the 
Journals for comment on these two items. " There 
was a baked-bean side even to Emerson." This 
humanizes him to me. Lincoln's manners in 1862 
offended him. But he defended them after he dis- 
covered Lincoln was a statesman. Emerson here 
shows himself in undress. To consider what some 
of the refined Lincoln flatterers of to-day would 
have said in their journals under similar circum- 
stances and dates might be to consider too curi- 
ously. At least, Emerson was honest, even if he 



was slightly provincial. We are all much more 
provincial than he was, and " to be honest, as this 
world goes, is to be one man picked out of ten 
thousand." 

Emerson, great as he was in his achievements 
with himself, was greater in his efforts for what 
he did not attain. What Matthew Arnold and 
Augustine Birrell say of him as a writer is worthy 
of more respect than some grant. But, as Arnold 
says, he is something more important than a great 
philosopher or a great poet because " he is the 
friend and aider of those who would live in the 
spirit." This is why the Essays are the most note- 
worthy contribution in prose in the nineteenth 
century. And this is why the Journals are more 
interesting than the Essays the judgment of our 
reviewer to the contrary notwithstanding.

In THE DIAL of July 16 Mr. Hyder E. Rollins 
of the University of Texas, writing of Mr. Lamar 
Fontaine, says : " After the war and until his 
death in Augusta, Georgia, he supported himself 
by teaching and surveying." 

" The Library of Southern Literature " (Vol. 
XV, p. 150) says that he died in Columbus, Georgia, 
and that " Before his death he published an ex- 
ceedingly interesting volume entitled ' My Life 
and My Lectures.' " 

"The South in the Building of the Nation" 
(Vol. XI, p. 353) says that he died in 1902. 

Permit me to say that Mr. Lamar Fontaine still 
lives in Lyon, Mississippi, near Clarksdale, and 
can recite for you any amount of poetry.

"ALL QUIET ALONG THE POTOMAC." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I should like the opportunity to say in reply 
to Mr. C. E. Benton's note in THE DIAL of August 
1, which until quite recently had escaped my notice, 
that I have been able to find in the libraries of 
Austin, Texas, and Baltimore, Maryland, only two 
copies of Bryant's " Library of Poetry and Song " : 
the 20th edition, revised, published by J. B. Ford 
and Company in 1871, and another published by 
the same company in 1872. In each of these 
volumes the poem, "All Quiet along the Potomac " 
(or "The Picket-guard"), is credited (p. 381) to 
Mrs. Ethel Lynn Beers, and in neither does Mrs. 
Rowland's name appear in the index of authors. 
Since none of the earlier editions of the " Library " 
are accessible to me, I have no opportunity of 
verifying Mr. Benton's statement or of accounting 
for the change if one was made of Mrs. 
Rowland's name to Mrs. Beers. The point, indeed, 
seems to me to be too unimportant to call for a 
longer search. HYDER E. ROLLINS.

A FAMOUS THEATRICAL, TRIUMVIRATE.* 



The memories of theatre-goers not yet old 
go back with fondness to the glad birth of the 
Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera, almost forty 
years ago, when "Trial by Jury" conclusively 
demonstrated to a London audience that it 
was possible to devise a mirthful and musical 
stage whimsicality that should not depend for 
its laughter-provoking quality on the leading 
comedian's painting his nose red or .indulging 
in boisterous buffoonery. To be more accu- 
rate, the memorable and fruitful collaboration 
of the humorous librettist and the no less 
humorous composer dates from the year 1871, 
when they surprised and delighted the fre- 
quenters of the Gaiety Theatre with a tuneful 
and rollicking production entitled, "Thespis, 
or the Gods Grown Old. ' ' If one may compare 
small things with great, or, rather, less great 
things with great, the revolution wrought by 
these masters in English comic opera was as 
important, in its way, as the change effected by 
^Eschylus in the composition and dramatic 
presentation of Greek tragedy, a change so 
great that he was even regarded by his 
Athenian admirers as the father of Greek 
tragedy. Certainly Gilbert and Sullivan will 
long be remembered as the originators of a 
style of light opera that substituted for the 
vapid jingles and futile rhymes characteristic 
of the would-be humorous musical pieces of 
the degenerate mid- Victorian period, a libretto 
that was fresh and original and brimming 
with unexpected and irresistible fun, and 
music that was in every way worthy of the 
admirable libretto and in the most perfect 
harmony with its spirit. Noteworthy is it, in 
passing, that the operas here under considera- 
tion were known from the first, and still con- 
tinue to be known, not by the name of the 
composer alone, nor by the names of the com- 
poser and the librettist, but by the names of 
the librettist and the composer, as if in recog- 
nition of Gilbert's superior claims as an 
unexampled master of the peculiar medium in 
which he worked. None the less is it true, 
however, that his collaborator was the one 
supremely suitable co-worker to supplement 
his genius. And of the third member of the 
gifted triumvirate, Richard D'Oyly Carte, 
his was the quickness of perception that dis- 
cerned the mutual fitness of the two for a 
lasting and profitable and artistically suc-

cessful partnership, and himself brilliantly 
essayed the business management of the com- 
bination. 

Concerning the authors of the reminiscences 
and anecdotes now presented in a substantial 
and thoroughly entertaining volume entitled 
"Gilbert and Sullivan, and Their Operas," 
Mr. Frangois Cellier, who died eight months 
ago in the midst of his work on the book, was 
long associated with the Savoy Theatre as 
musical director, and enjoyed the intimacy of 
the noted characters about whom he writes so 
appreciatively ; and Mr. Cunningham Bridge- 
man, playwright and at one time acting-man- 
ager of a D'Oyly Carte touring company, 
styles himself "one of the oldest and closest 
surviving associates and camp-followers of the 
D'Oyly Carte Army Corps," and recalls with 
satisfaction that he has "witnessed the orig- 
inal productions of every Gilbert and Sullivan 
opera, including that of 'Trial by Jury' at 
the Royalty Theatre in 1875, right down to 
what may be called the interregnum at the 
Savoy in 1901." This "interregnum" took 
place soon after Sullivan's death, which oc- 
curred in November of 1900, and had scarcely 
begun when Carte himself followed his friend 
and associate, leaving Gilbert alone of the 
three to fill out another decade of earthly 
existence. Other dates of importance in this 
chronicle of the Savoyards are 1876, the year 
in which D'Oyly Carte formed the Comedy 
Opera Company, and 1881, which saw the 
erection, under his supervision, of the Savoy 
Theatre, where for the rest of his active life he 
continued to exercise his managerial talents. 

The book chronicling the combined achieve- 
ments of these associated masters in their sev- 
eral fields of related activity is of a nature to 
call for little more from the present reviewer 
than a few additional details as to its con- 
tents and a selection of such illustrative 
extracts as space will permit of insertion. 
Mr. Cellier 's failing hand relinquishes the pen 
after tracing the fortunes of the Savoyards to 
about the close of the year 1884 and recording 
in this chronicle the successive triumphs 
achieved by such masterpieces as "H. M. S. 
Pinafore," "The Pirates of Penzance," "lo- 
lanthe," "Princess Ida," and the revived 
earlier piece, "The Sorcerer." Then Mr. 
Bridgeman takes up the narrative arid fills 
nearly once and a half as much space with 
recollections of "The Mikado," "Ruddigore," 
"The Yeomen of the Guard," "The Gondo- 
liers, ' ' brilliant revivals of earlier operas, and 
other kindred matters. 

Like many another purveyor of amusement 
of the lighter sort, Sir Arthur Sullivan had 
felt inward promptings to court the world's

applause by means of more serious work. As 
far back as his thirteenth year he had com- 
posed a sacred song, "0 Israel," which had 
been accepted and published by Novello ; and 
his brilliant orchestral accompaniment to 
Shakespeare 's ' ' Tempest, ' ' composed while he 
was a student at the Leipzig Conservatoire 
and performed with flattering success at a 
Gewandhaus concert before a distinguished 
audience, is probably still reckoned by some 
connoisseurs as his magnum opus. So at least 
thinks Mr. Cellier. Sullivan's pathetic song, 
"Thou art passing hence, my brother," com- 
posed beside the death-bed of his dramatically 
and musically gifted brother Fred, also attests 
the composer's possession of talents little sus- 
pected by the throngs that have taken delight 
in his comic operas. Paying tribute to certain 
phases of Sullivan's versatility, Mr. Cellier 
writes : 

" But Sullivan had already, notably in ' Trial by 
Jury,' proved himself a born humorist, fully ca- 
pable of entering into the spirit and essence of his 
colleague's fun. Such was his versatility that he 
was able to express in tone-words of equal elo- 
quence the Soliloquy of Shakespeare's Prospero, 
the grunt of Caliban, the song of Captain Cor- 
coran, or the patter of Sir Joseph Porter. More- 
over, Gilbert's * Pinafore ' was essentially English, 
and Arthur Sullivan's natural tone was English to 
his last demisemiquaver." 

A glimpse of the artist and the man at his 
work is afforded in the following : 

" Long and trying as were those rehearsals, there 
was seldom a sign of tedium or impatience on the 
part of any member of the company. They loved 
their work, and, whenever Sullivan came to the 
theatre with a fresh batch of music, every one 
appeared eager to hear it and hungry for more 
study. As with the chorus, so with the principals. 
There were occasions when a singer would, with 
full assurance of his own perfection, give forth 
some song hardly recognizable by the composer, 
whereupon Sullivan would humorously commend 
the singer on his capital tune and then he would 
add ' and now, my friend, might I trouble you 
to try mine?' I remember one instance when a 
tenor, as tenors are wont to do, lingered uncon- 
scionably on a high note. Sullivan interrupted 
him with the remark ' Yes, that's a fine note a 
very fine note but please do not mistake your 
voice for my composition.' " 

The author of the "Bab Ballads," unlike 
his colleague, cannot be shown to have cher- 
ished aspirations to higher things within the 
domain of his art than those by which his 
chief fame was so well earned. Before casting 
in his lot with Sullivan and, soon afterward, 
with Sullivan and Carte, he had written cer- 
tain burlesques and extravaganzas of the ultra- 
frivolous sort popular in the sixties, such as 
'/Dulcamara," "Robert the Devil," and "La 



Vivandiere. " Of this earlier and less-known 
Gilbert we have a fleeting view in the sub- 
joined paragraph touching on the first night 
of "Gretchen," a play of his that was pro- 
duced at the Olympic in 1879. 

" Suffering from an acute attack of nervous 
debility, as he termed it, the author felt it impos- 
sible to remain within the theatre. Accordingly, 
he spent the evening patrolling up and down the 
Strand, wandering through Covent Garden and 
Drury Lane. He continued his peregrinations 
until he thought it was about time to return to the 
Olympic to take his call before the curtain. Arriv- 
ing at the theatre, he discovered the last fragments 
of the audience dispersing from the doors. Where- 
upon he addressed an outside official to whom he 
was unknown. 'Is the play over?' he timidly 
inquired. ' Over ! ' exclaimed the man. * I should 
rather say it was over over and done for. Never 
see'd such a frost in all my born days.' Gilbert 
thanked his lucky stars that he had absented him- 
self from such a debacle our author, be it ob- 
served, was not accustomed to frosts." 



now a word as to the famous quarrel 
that for a brief period severed the friendly 
as well as the professional ties between the 
two men whose personalities permeate the 
pages of the book under review. It was a 
quarrel that at the same time involved the 
third member of the partnership. Indeed, he 
seems to have been the innocent author of the 
sad rupture. Mr. Bridgeman, who describes 
this tempest in a teacup, as he calls it, neglects 
to give its date ; but apparently it occurred in 
1891 and friendly relations were not resumed 
until 1893. And the casus belli was a 
carpet ! 

"It appears that Mr. D'Oyly Carte, as duly au- 
thorized business manager of the firm, conceived it 
to be, not only politic, but right and proper, to 
minister to the comfort of clients through whose 
patronage and support their business had thrived 
so remarkably. Accordingly Mr. Carte purchased, 
among sundry other items of furniture for the 
renewal and repair of the theatre, a carpet. The 
carpet, et cetera, were in the usual course charged 
to the joint account. Sir Arthur Sullivan, on his 
part, raised no objection to the outlay, and, for the 
sake of peace, did his utmost to persuade Mr. Gil- 
bert to take a similar view of the matter. But Mr. 
Gilbert remained obdurate in his opposition to such 
lavish expenditure. He was of opinion that a new 
carpet, costing 140, would not draw an extra six- 
pence into the exchequer, that the theatre was so 
crowded nightly that no one could possibly tell or 
care a jot how the floor was covered. Mr. Gilbert 
thought it was a sheer waste of money. He was 
then politely reminded that, by the terms of their 
partnership agreement, he had no voice in the 
matter. Whereupon our author waxed exceeding 
wroth, went to law against his old friends and com- 
rades, and, parting company with the Savoyards, 
formed a troupe of clever ' Mountebanks,' and 
became their chief conjointly with one of the most

delightful of Bohemians, most amiable of men and 
most charming of composers whose name was 
Alfred Cellier." 

Tantcene animis ccelestibus irw? As absurd 
and insufficient was the cause of this lament- 
able but happily brief misunderstanding as 
that of much more important altercations. 
But Gilbert was quick-tempered and impul- 
sive perhaps because he was so warm-hearted 
and lovable. 

Of the remaining member of the Savoy tri- 
umvirate, space is lacking but for the briefest 
word. Son of Richard Carte, partner in the 
London firm of Rudall and Carte, makers of 
musical instruments, he early showed a pas- 
sionate love of music, but seems to have had 
no great conceit of his own genius in that 
field of art, and, wisely from a commercial 
point of view, turned his attention to the ex- 
ploiting of others ' talents rather than his own, 
excepting, of course, his talent for discovering 
histrionic and musical ability and developing 
its possibilities in a business way. 

As in the reminiscences of all stage folk, 
Mr. Cellier 's and Mr. Bridgeman's pages are 
not lacking in the emotional element in 
what Gilbert himself called "heart-foam" 
and to this ingredient they doubtless owe no 
little of their charm. There are many por- 
traits and other illustrations, and half a dozen 
facsimiles of letters. Notable, too, is the 
appended ' ' chronological list of all the operas 
produced at the Opera Comique and Savoy 
theatres under the D 'Oyly Carte management, 
from May 15, 1877, to March 1, 1909, with 
cast of each opera." Altogether, the book is 
an admirable record of an important period 
in the history of English comic opera.

OUR NATURAL ENEMY ?* 



In February and March, 1913, Professor 
J. A. Cramb delivered a series of lectures at 
Queen's College, London, where he held the 
chair of Modern History. As he lectured, his 
vitality ebbed, and he doubtless knew that he 
could not last much longer. Nevertheless, or 
indeed we may suppose because of this, he 
threw himself into the work with extraor- 
dinary ardor, giving his last message to a 
heedless nation. He was too weak to prepare 
the lectures for publication, and died in 
October, 1913. Other hands have gathered 
together the fragments, and the resulting 
little book is now being widely read in En- 
gland, and is published this month in the 
United States. For the thing* he expected has

come to pass, and people now listen to his 
words. As we read, we are reminded of 
Carlyle: a whirlwind of rhetoric, yet tre- 
mendous sincerity ; a mind innocent of science, 
steeped in the literature of history, seeing 
everywhere inevitable tendencies. As the child 
grows to be a man, or perishes, so must na- 
tions expand, absorb, assimilate or else 
decay. The world-empire of England may be 
friendly or hostile to Germany ; that does not 
matter so much; what matters is that this 
empire stands in the way of German develop- 
ment, since, unfortunately, there is only one 
available world. From this standpoint, al- 
though Professor Cramb did not emphasize 
the fact, the United States is part of the 
British incubus, though politically indepen- 
dent. It is indeed, with Canada, the largest 
and fairest part, a whole continent whereon 
the British idea has freely developed in the 
presence of unparalleled opportunity, showing 
in its very modifications its adaptive vitality. 
We have prided ourselves on the incorporation 
of a splendid German population, lovers of 
liberty and independent thought, seeking se- 
curity and opportunity among us, and finding 
it. We like to think of Carl Schurz as a type 
of our gains in this respect, a representative 
of thousands less eminent, but with something 
of the same spirit. We have fancied that the 
German nation might properly regard us with 
favor on account of these things; even with 
some measure of affection. But Professor 
Cramb, voicing a very different feeling, in- 
terpreted the thought of modern Germany in 
these words : 

" Germany, from her own inward resources, pro- 
duces year by year greater surplus energy, mental 
and physical, than any other nation in the world; 
yet year by year, by emigration to America, to 
England, and to other lands, that surplus energy 
is lost to her. Year by year are we to look on in 
impotent anger or in apathy whilst the best and 
most enterprising of our citizens quit the Father- 
land and, living under other governments, cease to 
be Germans, bequeath their worth, that is to say 
their valor, to those nations who may be ultimately 
Germany's deadliest enemies?" 

Developing this idea, Professor Cramb asked : 
" How do England and her Empire stand in the 
path of the deepest desires and ambitions, and per- 
haps, also, the highest and most sacred aspirations 
of Germany? If we ask what those desires, ambi- 
tions, and aspirations are, the answer is this: 
Germany, not less than England, it is contended, 
is dowered with the genius for empire, that power 
in a race which, like genius in the artist, must 
express itself or destroy its possessor. An Empire 
she once had, centuries before France and England 
fought. That empire is lost. But in the German 
race the instinct for empire is as ancient and as 
deeply rooted as it is in the English race ; and in the

Germany of the present time, above all, this in- 
stinct, by reason of the very strength of Germany 
within herself, her conscious and vital energy, her 
sense of deep and repressed forces, is not a mere 
cloud in the brain, but is almost an imperious 
necessity. This is the real driving-force in German 
politics, the essential thing." 

Hence the inevitable conflict, the ostensible 
causes of which do but mask the fruition of 
a tree, the growth of which might have been 
witnessed by all who cared to see, these twenty 
years past. 

Hence, said Professor Cramb, all talk of 
peace is nonsense. Believing himself to under- 
stand the German temper, sympathizing with 
its purpose, but desiring Britain to be pre- 
pared, he could scarcely find language to ex- 
press his contempt of those who hoped, by 
conferences and mutual agreements, to ensure 
the peace of the world. 

" England and Germany on which is Pacif- 
icism likelier to exercise a deleterious and a dan- 
gerous effect? From to-day's survey of eternal 
abstract principles, as from last week's survey of 
ephemeral yet not insignificant criticism of England 
and her Empire, it becomes apparent that Germany 
is not England's only enemy, perhaps not even her 
chief." 

So finally, with belligerent phrases, the 
book ends as follows : 

"And if the dire event of a war with Germany 
if it is a dire event should ever occur, there shall 
be seen upon this earth of ours a conflict which, 
beyond all others, will recall that description of the 
great Greek wars: 

' Heroes in battle with heroes, 

And above them the wrathful gods.' 
And one can imagine the ancient, mighty deity of 
all the Teutonic kindred, throned above the clouds, 
looking serenely down upon that conflict, upon his 
favourite children, the English and the Germans, 
locked in a death-struggle, smiling upon the hero- 
ism of that struggle, the heroism of the children of 
Odin the War-god !" 

Professor Cramb was not insane. He cor- 
rectly interpreted the feeling of those respon- 
sible for the present war, and illustrated, in 
his person, the reaction of a highly endowed 
mind in a particular educational environment. 
In their native endowment, the Germanic and 
English races are not so different as to be 
irreconcilable. This was recognized in the 
lament that Germans are so easily incor- 
porated in the body politic of America, and 
"cease to be Germans." What do they cease 
to be? Do they lose, by the mere process of 
transplanting to another continent, their Teu- 
tonic inheritance? If so, of what avail is a 
German world-empire ? No one pretends that 
they lose it; what they do lose, if anything, 
is the Germanic tradition of world-empire, 



the Germanic hostility to all other men, be- 
cause they are other men. Or, again, why this 
agitation because of peaceful tendencies in 
England? Is that country in danger of put- 
ting off its ancient virility? If it is, it is not 
by the process which excited the wrath of 
Professor Cramb. For good biological rea- 
sons, we may think it necessary to bestir 
ourselves, on both sides of the Atlantic, to 
preserve and perpetuate what is best in our 
blood, but we need not take the fury born of a 
militant propaganda for stability or strength. 

It is a long and many-sided story, but al- 
ways we come back to this : given a virile race, 
it remains for education to decide whether it 
shall further or hinder the orderly progress 
of the species. Germany, and above all the 
German rulers, preoccupied with ideas of do- 
minion and of war, trained to think of fighting 
as the noblest aim, must sooner or later have 
broken the peace. How far and in what 
measure other countries are to blame is unim- 
portant for the argument. The truth is that 
all this misery results from teachings and 
traditions which are considered not criminal 
only because they have public sanction. Pro- 
fessor Cramb was so far the victim of such 
teachings that he not only saw what was about 
to happen, but substantially approved. 

It remains for America, with all her imper- 
fections, to make the great sociological dis- 
coveries. We are demonstrating to an aston- 
ished world that alcoholic liquor is not neces- 
sary for happiness. We are able to live 
unafraid next door to Canada, with no forts 
or standing armies on the border. Not without 
difficulty, it is true, we have shown that it is 
possible for a great nation to have at its head 
one who is as much of a gentleman in his 
public as in his private capacity, and who is, 
above all, a genuine representative of the 
spirit of peace. Never before has "political 
necessity" counted for so little and decency 
for so much. 

We do not agree with everything our gov- 
ernment does. It requires little knowledge of 
public affairs to discover stupidity or worse 
in high places; we reserve our right to 
criticize, and will not endorse all the actions 
of any party or man in advance. In science 
one discovery opens the way to a hundred 
others; so also in national affairs every ad- 
vance points the way to others, and "divine 
discontent" is the motive force of progress. 
The labor is incessant and there is no haven 
of rest, but we have at least the hope and 
belief that it is possible to progress from 
good to better, without periodically relapsing 
into the barbarism of wholesale murder.

THE CASE FOB THE MATRIARCHATE.* 

Mrs. Gallichan seems completely to have 
abandoned Spain and Spanish art, on which 
she was a well-known writer, for feminism. 
This year she follows " The Truth about 
Woman" with a study of the position of 
women in primitive society entitled ' ' The Age 
of the Mother-Power," and it is understood 
that next year she will have ready a volume 
on motherhood. 

There is no doubt about her faith or her 
purpose in writing the present book. In her 
judgment, the case of feminism may be ma- 
terially strengthened if it can be shown that 
at one time in the history of the race woman 
was the dominating factor in the family, 
whose authority over her children and her 
possessions was acknowledged. The patent 
manifestations of this domination in the ma- 
ternal clan, whereby the names of children 
and the inheritance of property passed 
through woman, are abundant. But, owing 
to the exuberance of Bachofen and his school 
in defending their thesis with more zeal than 
knowledge, much discredit has been thrown 
in some quarters upon the existence of a 
matriarchate, or the rule of mother-right. "We 
are, to be sure, dealing with a hypothesis, but 
with one which alone will explain customs and 
conditions proved to have existed in almost 
all parts of the world in primitive times, and 
of which there are innumerable traces among 
both primitive and civilized races to the pres- 
ent day. Mrs. Gallichan, then, is a staunch 
defender of the matriarchate as having ex- 
isted, and she has adduced strong reasons for 
her qualified admiration of it. Her original- 
ity to the student of primitive society is found 
in her claim that the maternal clan in which 
woman was the dominating factor was not the 
first stage of human society, as has been gen- 
erally contended by its partisans, but that it 
grew out of a primitive patriarchal society as 
a needed reform of the abuses imposed by 
the sexual jealousy of the ape-patriarch over 
his harem of wives and daughters. As a 
measure of self-protection making for free- 
dom and cooperation among women, it was a 
timely step toward social peace. It stood for 
social progress because it was based upon the 
general good instead of that of the individual, 
and because it vested with real and permanent 
as well as with sentimental power the child- 
bearing portion of the human race. 

The proof of the existence of mother-right, 
which Mrs. Gallichan felt that she had to 
establish anew, is based upon the same time-

honored travellers' and anthropologists' tales 
which have been bandied about for fifty years 
by all writers on the matriarchate. The cus- 
toms of Algonquins, Creeks, Pueblos, Malays, 
Zunis, Australian Bushmen, and Touaregs of 
the Sahara are not only hackneyed, but they 
leave the reader cold. With the Jews, Greeks, 
Romans, and Celts we are nearer home, and 
we wish more evidence might be drawn from 
the customs of these races with which we have 
more affinity. The historians of human so- 
ciety seem to be condemned to wander in a 
far-off, if happy, hunting-ground. However, 
once more the existence of the matriarchate 
is claimed, and its place in the age following 
the patriarchal age is credibly established. 
The chapter which accounts for the inevitable 
reestablishment of man in his place of au- 
thority is interesting and more novel. This 
reestablishment of father-right was due to the 
developed sense of individuality and of prop- 
erty, in which even woman came to be bought 
from! her relatives as a chattel: "As soon as 
women became sexually marketable their free- 
dom was doomed." Under this third system, 
or the reestablished patriarchal system, under 
which we still live, the bride leaves the pro- 
tection of her family and forms with her hus- 
band and children a new individual unit in 
which her position is one of subjection 
sexual, legal, and ecclesiastical. Individual- 
ism triumphed, but brought with it jealousy 
and sham morality. 

Each one of these three supposed epochs in 
human society has had its raison d'etre, and 
each has marked in some sense a progress over 
the preceding. All the more reason why there 
should be another effort to restore the now 
deranged sexual equilibrium and, after some 
fashion not yet clearly indicated, give woman 
again such freedom of choice and action as 
will enable her to give full expression to her 
womanhood. Society must constantly evolve 
toward something higher. 

Mrs. Gallichan 's interest in the position of 
woman in primitive society is plainly sub- 
servient to her interest in present-day fem- 
inism. She has had the ingenuity to seek in 
primitive history and legend grounds for a 
popular campaign. She is not conventional 
where morality is concerned. But her aspira- 
tions are reassuring and will have a hearing 
from the other sex: "Women must gain eco- 
nomic security, and the freedom for the full 
expression of their womanhood. The ultimate 
goal I conceive at least I hope is the 
right to be women, not to become like men. 
There can be no gain for women except this. 
To be mothers were women created, and to be 
fathers men. This rightly considered is the

deepest of all truths." The picture drawn of 
the age when woman exercised rights equal, 
if not superior, to those of men is pertinent 
to the discussion of the pending problem, and 
it contains elements which may serve as a 
partial modus operandi for the reconquest of 
her place by woman in our own day. This 
book, while starting with second-hand docu- 
ments, has presented a somewhat novel con- 
clusion, and has "connected up" an academic 
discussion with a vital issue.

AMERICAN POLITICAL, PARTIES.* 



During the year 1912-3 Professor William 
M. Sloane, of Columbia University, in the 
capacity of Roosevelt Professor, delivered at 
the universities of Berlin and Munich an ex- 
tended series of lectures upon the subject of 
political parties and party phenomena in the 
United States. The lectures, in German form, 
were published immediately in Leipzig. In 
English dress, revised, and brought down to 
date, they are now presented to students and 
readers of Great Britain and America. 

The subject is obviously one of appalling 
magnitude and complexity. We have several 
high-grade general histories of the United 
States ; we have no small number of excellent 
books upon various selected phases of Ameri- 
can party history and machinery; but we 
do not have any really comprehensive, pene- 
trating, and well-balanced treatise on our 
party system as a whole. The nearest ap- 
proach to a work of the kind is to be found 
in the writings of Mr. Bryce and Professor 
Ostrogorski. But these keen observers did not 
undertake to deal with all aspects of the sub- 
ject, and their achievement has been rather 
the discernment and characterization of note- 
worthy party phenomena than the detailed 
presentation of party history or the systematic 
description of party organization and activi- 
ties. In a measure, Professor Sloane's book 
fills the gap ; but only in a measure, for it is 
too brief to be more than a substantial outline 
of the subject, and highly important phases 
of present-day party machinery and action 
are scarcely touched upon in it. 

The author's method is primarily, as it 
should be, historical. Beginning with a few 
very brief chapters on political ideas in eight- 
eenth century England and America, he moves 
forward chronologically through the national 
history of the country to our own time, stating 
the external facts of party affairs very briefly, 
explaining the origins and character of new

party phenomena as they arise, and supplying 
withal a considerable amount of carefully con- 
sidered and illuminating philosophical inter- 
pretation. In fact, the value of Professor 
Sloane's work lies principally at the last- 
mentioned point, in his linking up of the 
growth of parties and the general economic 
and political development of the country. For 
the details of party history, and especially of 
party workings, one will have to look else- 
where. For a running commentary, however, 
on the growth of party government in the 
country, written in the large by a student of 
world history, and therefore involving some 
detached points of view and a wealth of allu- 
sion likely to be beyond the reach of the 
narrower specialists in the field, Professor 
Sloane's book will probably stand for some 
time in a class by itself. 

The most imperative of all political prob- 
lems in the United States at the present day. 
in the opinion of the author, is the relation of 
parties and democracy. With the progress of 
the doctrines of the initiative, referendum, 
and recall of the conception that the people 
should rule directly and that representatives 
should be at best simple delegates what is 
to become of party? The first thing to be 
ascertained, however, is whether these new 
doctrines are really going to ' ' progress. ' ' Pro- 
fessor Sloane admits that it is "in this direc- 
tion that all present-day political action 
trends"; although it would seem that he 
might have taken more account of the numer- 
ous evidences that a reaction has already set 
in. In any event, he pronounces the sup- 
posedly accepted opinions "snap judgments" 
and declares, naturally enough, that their ulti- 
mate effect upon party conditions cannot at 
this stage be foreseen. One type of party 
machinery seems to be disappearing, and the 
role of party principles is less important than 
once it was. But whether we are in the midst 
of a real transition to conditions permanently 
different or on the eve of a backward swing 
to the conditions of a generation ago, no man 
can say. 

It is a thesis of Professor Sloane that "the 
political feature of greatest significance since 
1850 has been the steady growth in power of 
the presidency"; and one of the most sug- 
gestive chapters in the book is that in which 
is discussed the subject "Parties and the 
Presidency." Written in days very recent, 
this chapter takes some account of the evi- 
dence drawn from the history of the present 
administration which tends to sustain the gen- 
eral proposition. But it would seem that a 
larger amount of evidence is at hand than has 
been cited.

The book contains no bibliography; there 
are practically no foot-notes or other refer- 
ences to documents ; and although there is an 
appendix, the reason for including in it some 
of its contents is not obvious. 

FREDERIC AUSTIN OGG. 



NIETZSCHE AXD DR. BR ANDES.* 



Nietzsche and Dr. Georg Brandes were born 
to know each other. They were, in one of 
those familiar phrases to which Nietzsche con- 
trived to give a sort of mystical import, ' ' good 
Europeans. ' ' What is destined to be, is, never- 
theless, often mysteriously delayed, so that 
waste results. It was not until 1887 that Dr. 
Brandes first wrote to Nietzsche; the corre- 
spondence that thereupon ensued lasted until 
the eclipse of Nietzsche's intellect, early in 
1889. Now that the letters have been given to 
the world, one can estimate the waste that 
resulted from the late meeting of the most 
provocative German writer of our time and 
the most curious and insatiable of living 
critics. 

The letters are introduced by an essay, pro- 
jected by Dr. Brandes as early as 1887, in the 
hope of stimulating in Denmark an interest 
in Nietzsche's writings. At that time Dr. 
Brandes could not, he tells us, assume a knowl- 
edge of Nietzsche 's thought. Did not Nietzsche 
himself, in chaffing his friend on the proposed 
undertaking, express amazement that he should 
dare to speak in public of a vir obscurissimus? 
The essay had to be chiefly an exposition, and 
Dr. Brandes assures us it has, on that ac- 
count, been largely "outstripped." But he 
is altogether too modest. The very sub-title 
he chose reveals the penetration one expects 
of him "An Essay on Aristocratic Radical- 
ism." "What could be happier? Nietzsche 
himself enthusiastically approved the phrase. 
"The expression ' aristocratic radicalism,' 
which you employ, is," he hastens to write, 
"very good. It is, permit me to say, the 
cleverest thing I have yet read about myself." 

Dr. Brandes admits that he had hit upon 
this epithet after a prayerful examination of 
his own mind. It covered much that the two 
men had in common. Later, Dr. Brandes was 
bitterly and inexplicably assailed as a rene- 
gade and charged with having modified his 
own liberal opinions as a result of his enthusi- 
astic reading of Nietzsche. Those who assailed 
him had thought of him as a radical; they 
forgot, or had never discerned, that he was 
also an aristocratic radical. That is to say,

they overlooked the quite obvious fact that he 
was not the sort of man to surrender his 
critical sense in the face of a sentimental en- 
thusiasm. But Dr. Brandes found then a 
defence which gives us a key to his fine critical 
method and is expressive of one of the leading 
enthusiasms of the modern mind. He said: 
"No mature reader studies Nietzsche with the 
latent design of adopting his opinions, still 
less with that of propagating them. "We are 
not children in search of instruction, but 
skeptics in search of men, and we rejoice when 
we have found a man the rarest thing 
there is." 

The attack was the more absurd because, 
although the essay is mainly descriptive and 
biographical, Dr. Brandes did not fail to indi- 
cate where his thought was at variance with 
Nietzsche's. They were together in their 
hatred of ascetic ideals as well as in their pro- 
found disgust with democratic mediocrity; 
and they were distrustful of current culture, 
that professorial culture which Nietzsche 
happily called "Culture-Philistinism." On 
the other hand, Dr. Brandes did not agree 
with Nietzsche's reading of history. He pro- 
fessed himself unable to understand Nietzsche 's 
contempt for the morality of pity ; and, lastly, 
he (good, uncompromising feminist) could not 
reconcile himself to the philosopher's dictum 
that we ought, in our treatment of women, to 
return to "the vast common sense of old 
Asia." No, such was not Dr. Brandes 's idea. 
Yet even at that point they had something in 
common, for he was quite willing to subscribe 
to Nietzsche's view that the free and great 
spirit is unfit for marriage. The only differ- 
ence between them was that Dr. Brandes could 
not bring himself to believe that all free and 
great spirits tread the earth in male bodies. 
It is plain enough, too, that Dr. Brandes found 
it hard to understand why a modern man 
of Nietzsche's intellectual power should be 
willing to lash himself into a fury over the 
Christian religion. To him all that was like 
an echo from remote battlefields of the human 
spirit; he would as soon have thought of 
' ' assailing a belief in werewolves as a belief in 
Christianity. ' ' 

But a word more and we shall turn to the 
letters. Dr. Brandes found as early as 1899 
ten years after the publication of the first 
essay the true characterization of the nature 
of the attacks on Nietzsche. No better state- 
ment of it is needed than this one: "The 
opposition to him is conducted sometimes (as 
by Ludwig Stein) on serious and scientific 
lines, although from narrow pedagogic 
premises; sometimes (as by Herr Max Nor- 
dau) with sorry weapons and with the 



298

[Oct. 16 



assumed superiority of presumptuous medioc- 
rity." The fact that the public does not 
resent this interference amounts really to a 
confession of intellectual immaturity. We 
tacitly admit that we are children who have 
to be protected from a malign influence, not 
skeptics in search of men. 

The letters themselves tend to confirm exist- 
ing impressions of Nietzsche 's character rather 
than to upset them. Much that we should 
naturally infer from a reading of his books 
is here underscored and presented with the 
free informal emphasis of good talk. There 
is something of Wagner's influence on the 
early Nietzsche ; of the state of his health and 
its effect on his writings; of the ecstacy of 
pure thought (to Nietzsche what one thinks 
is only a measure of one's courage, and he was 
always wondering whether he would have 
courage enough) ; of marriage and other ' ' old 
institutions." It is needless to say that it is 
all very sincere and penetrating talk. 

From it there emerges Nietzsche 's delight in 
sheer diablerie. It is almost naive. It par- 
takes of the vulgar passion to shock the bour- 
geoisie. But in a philosopher it has an oddly 
winning quality. Philosophers do not com- 
monly pay us the compliment of shocking us. 
Nietzsche, on the other hand, delighted to 
regard himself as the "bogyman" of the 
modern world, a German artilleryman turned 
philosopher. Thus, he writes to his friend, 
apropos of the appearance of a new book : 

" With a cynicism that will become famous in 
the world's history, I have now related myself. 
The book is called ' Ecce Homo,' and is an attack 
on the Crucified without the slightest reservation; 
it ends in thunders and lightnings against every- 
thing that is Christian or infected with Chris- 
tianity, till one is blinded and deafened. I am in 
fact the first psychologist of Christianity and, as 
an old artilleryman, can bring heavy guns into 
action, the existence of which no opponent of 
Christianity has even suspected. The whole is the 
prelude to the ' Transvaluation of All Values,' the 
work that lies ready before me: I swear to you 
that in two years we shall have the whole world in 
convulsions. I am a fate. 

" Guess who come off worst in ' Ecce Home ' ? 
Messieurs the Germans! I have told them terrible 
things. . . . The Germans, for instance, have it on 
their conscience that they deprived the last great 
epoch of history, the Renaissance, of its meanings 
at a moment when the Christian values, the de- 
cadence values, were worsted, when they were con- 
quered in the instincts even of the highest ranks 
of the clergy by the opposite instincts, the in- 
stincts of life. To attack the Church that meant 
to re-establish Christianity. (Cesare Borgia as 
pope tbat would have been the meaning of the 
Renaissance, its proper symbol.)" 

Or, again he writes : 

" In a month or two something philosophical 



may be expected; under the very inoffensive title 
of ' Leisure Hours of a Psychologist ' I am saying 
agreeable and disagreeable things to the world at 
large including that intelligent nation, the Ger- 
nlans. 

" But all this is in the main nothing but recrea- 
tion beside the main thing: the name of the latter 
is ' Transvaluation of All Values.' Europe will 
have to discover a new Siberia, to which to consign 
the author of these experiments with values." 

Nietzsche's belief in the ministration of 
pain is familiar enough. For years he en- 
dured excruciating headaches, which some- 
times prostrated him for two hundred days 
in the year. His fortitude was nothing short 
of heroic, but it had its supreme rewards. 
Writing of the period from 1876 to 1881, he 
says: 

" My speciality was to endure extreme pain, 
cru, vert, with perfect clarity, for two or three 
consecutive days, accompanied by constant vomit- 
ing of bile. The report has been put about that 
I am in a madhouse (and indeed that I died there). 
Nothing is further from the truth. As a matter 
of fact my intellect only came to maturity during 
that terrible time : witness the ' Dawn of Day,' 
which I wrote in 1881 during a winter of incredible 
suffering at Genoa, away from doctors, friends or 
relations. . . . After all, my illness has been of the 
greatest use to me: it has released me, it has 
restored to me the courage to be myself. . . . And, 
indeed, in virtue of my instincts, I am a brave 
animal, a military one even. The long resistance 
has somewhat exasperated my pride. Am I a 
philosopher, do you ask? But what does that 
matter. . . ." 

In selecting passages for reproduction from 
these letters, which touch so many subjects, 
one is exasperated by the sense that what one 
omits is quite as much to the point as what 
one gives. But there is an episode that must 
be related: it shows so clearly the playful 
adroitness in practical affairs of which 
Nietzsche was capable and illustrates the 
psychological acumen that made these two 
"good Europeans" such delightful letter 
writers. Dr. Brandes, preparing to lecture on 
Nietzsche, begs for a photograph. Nietzsche 
replies that he has none, but his friend will not 
be put off. Nietzsche thereupon takes measures 
of his own : 

" Meanwhile," he writes, "I hope my photograph 
will have reached you. It goes without saying 
that I took steps, not exactly to be photographed 
(for I am extremely distrustful of haphazard 
photographs), but to abstract a photograph from 
somebody who had one of me." 

Doubtless that was a clever idea, but it 
failed to satisfy his friend, for we find him 
replying : 

"The letters and the music were an unqualified 
pleasure; the portrait might have been better. It 
is a profile taken at Naumburg, characteristic in 



1914] 



THE DIAL

its attitude, but with too little expression. You 
must have looked different from this ; the writer of 
Zarathustra must have had more secrets written 
in his own face." 

And Nietzsche confesses the truth : 
" What eyes you have ! You are right, the 
Nietzsche of the photograph is not yet the author 
of Zarathustra he is a few years too young for 
that." 

The communion of these two vigorous and 
independent spirits was not destined to endure 
for long, but there is convincing proof that it 
left a profound impression on Nietzsche. Dr. 
Brandes had offered him the priceless gift of 
intelligent sympathy when he knew little but 
neglect or stupid opposition. Is it strange, 
then, that the memory of this resolute friend 
of his should have remained with Nietzsche to 
the last flicker of intelligence and even passed 
over into the twilight? The final letter, that 
now famous and infinitely pathetic letter, 
signed ' ' The Crucified, ' ' undated, unstamped, 
and addressed simply "To the Friend Georg" 
how it bears witness to the strength of those 
genuine friendships that are based on a pro- 
found community of the mind.

RECENT FICTION.* 



It is the new novelists who most excite our 
curiosity. The familiar ones, however good, 
have so few surprises for us that we do not 
look forward to any. For that matter, the new 
ones are seldom startling. A good novel by 
an unknown author is rare; a first-rate one 
is the event of a decade. Reviewers discover 
first-rate ones oftener than that, of course; 
but reviewers are peculiarly susceptible : their 
anxiety makes them so. 

Mr. Edward C. Venable is not an event ; but 
he is distinctly a surprise. He is altogether 
new to us and his novel is more than passable. 
He has told his story in the first person, which 
seems to have given his faculty for making 
amusing observations free play. The book opens 
with Pierre Vinton's reflections on his divorce 
from his wife, Marcella. They lived together for 
three years, lived separately for two years, and 
then secured a divorce on grounds of incom- 
patibility. It was all done without any scan- 
dal, so that everybody was satisfied, except 
Pierre. He was as much as ever in love with

Marcella, and that was a good deal. His sense 
of loss was not mitigated by his conviction that 
it was due to a failure on his part in the only 
task he had ever seriously undertaken in his 
life. His friend, Mrs. Axson, said that he was 
tired of Marcella and that she was tired of 
him, and that "that was all there was to it." 
The rector of St. Stephen's had nothing but 
words to offer. Mrs. Malory, who made a fetish 
of motherhood and domesticity, said the whole 
trouble was that Marcella had had no children. 
Pierre's cousin Phillippe, who belonged in 
France, explained : 

" * You amused her as a lover, because you were 
rich and she was poor; but you bored her as a 
husband.' 

" 'You touch,' I said, ' the very heart of the 
matter. I failed as a husband. What is a husband, 
Phillippe f 

" ' The good God only knows/ answered Phillippe 
calmly. ' He is a woman's nearest approach to a 
good friend, perhaps. . . .' " 

When Mrs. Malory heard that Marcella would 
have a little flat all to herself and make her own 
living, she was surprised into murmuring, "I 
think it would be the loveliest thing in the 
world ' ' ; which is a pleasant bit of irony. Mar- 
cella might have married again, but Pierre 
heard of her engagement and assaulted her 
fiance. Then there was nothing to do but to go 
away. Up to this point the story Mr. Venable 
has to tell is true and interesting, but this point 
is that at which the real story should begin. 
And that story Mr. Venable has no intention of 
telling. The situation, an excellent one if he 
had the knowledge or the will, or whatever he 
lacks, to work it out, is hurriedly abandoned. 
Pierre lets his foot slip in the Alps, and is 
picked up with a fractured skull. Marcella 
hastens to him, knowing at last that "there is 
no divorce, there is only release, ' ' and they are 
reunited as soon as he is out of his delirium. 
Thus a novel apparently well begun, and one 
written with humor and force, falls to pieces 
except, of course, for the sentimental reader. 

Mr. Samuel Hopkins Adams is familiar 
enough to the readers of "Collier's Weekly" 
but hardly to those who buy novels or rent 
them for three cents a day. His book, "The 
Health Master, ' ' was a novel in form only. It 
is therefore a pleasant surprise to have a story 
from him as good as "The Clarion." Mr. 
Adams has managed to combine in it the things 
he has picked up as a newspaper man and 
the things he learned in "muck-raking" the 
patent-medicine industry. The situation on 
which the story turns is like that of Ibsen's 
"An Enemy of the People," except that it is 
complicated by a number of subsidiary situa- 
tions. The hero, Harrington Surtaine, comes 
home after college and Europe to a father 



[Oct. 16 



who began life as an itinerant vender of a 
panacea, and who became the millionaire 
owner of a patent-medicine business. The 
young man wishes the first week to thrash the 
editor of a local paper which attacks his father 
and, failing in this, he buys out the proprietor. 
Then his education in the practical affairs of 
American life begins. It is rounded off to a 
degree by his experience during an epidemic 
which the business men of the town wish to 
conceal. The action is obvious and the style 
is crude, but the whole somehow makes what 
we call ' ' a good story. ' ' A novelist who took 
his art more seriously would have wanted as 
much space for the development of young Sur- 
taine's first adventures with a newspaper, or 
his father's character, or any one of several 
other matters, as Mr. Adams has devoted to 
all of thenr. But while Mr. Adams is neither 
deep nor delicate he is readable, in the jour- 
nalistic sense. 

Mr. J. D. Beresford is not a new and un- 
proved writer, but one still little known to 
the general public. "The House in Demetrius 
Road" is a realistic study of a dipsomaniac, 
and one done rather as Mr. Arnold Bennett 
would do it than as would the press-agent of 
the Anti-Saloon League. The chief figure is 
a young Scotchman, Robin Greg. The only 
other important characters are Martin Bond, 
who becomes Greg's secretary, and Margaret 
Hamilton, a sister-in-law of Greg's, who comes 
to Demetrius Road to keep house for him. 
Martin seems a singularly naive young man. 
He fails to discover the mystery of the house- 
hold until Margaret tells him that Greg is a 
victim of alcohol. The two endeavor to cure 
Greg by means of a drug, and Margaret goes 
so far as to promise to marry him as soon as 
the passage of the act permitting a man to 
marry his deceased wife's sister makes it pos- 
sible. But the drug fails and Margaret falls 
in love with Martin. The final scene (and one 
admirably prepared for) is that in which Greg 
tells the young people that they have betrayed 
him and orders them to leave the house. "It 
was all so specious, it wore such an air of un- 
deniable truth, ' ' that Martin was overwhelmed. 
Mr. Beresford has written truly and well in 
every respect save one. His story needs an 
important figure, such a figure as Greg was 
apparently intended to be, but is not. 

The procession of novels in series, especially 
European ones, continues. The first season 
which fails to bring a section of one of these 
remarkable works in three or four volumes by 
a foreign novelist will be a disappointment. 
There was ' ' Jean Christophe ' ' ; there is ' ' Pelle 
the Conqueror"; and now comes the first vol- 
ume of "The Books of the Small Souls." Its 



author, Mr. Louis Couperus, is a notable fig- 
ure in his native Holland, but he is virtually 
new to this country. Mr. de Mattos, who has 
translated "Small Souls" into English and 
whose enthusiasm in this case seems quite as 
genuine as it was in that (for which we are so 
grateful) of M. Fabre, promises that the re- 
maining volumes of the history of the van 
Lowe family will be forthcoming whenever the 
public asks for them. Mr. de Mattos 's implied 
doubt of the public is probably a justifiable 
one. For "Small Souls" is distinctly not the 
kind of good work which arouses wide interest 
in a new author. It is perhaps true that the 
best work is never too good for the public. 
But fine examples of the realistic novel are 
very slow to find readers, at least in English. 
Has it not required more than thirty years to 
reach the modest number of persons who have 
read Mr. George Moore's "A Mummer's 
Wife"? And that book was not under the 
handicap of being, with all that the fact im- 
plies, a translation, though it did, perhaps, 
deal with as small souls as those who furnish 
Mr. Couperus with a title. The van Lowe 
family, members of the Dutch bourgeoisie, are 
displayed by a simple device. It happens that 
a daughter, Constance, became disgracefully 
involved, shortly after her marriage, with 
young van der Welcke, a member of the diplo- 
matic service in Rome. Family pressure had 
brought about a divorce for Constance and a 
marriage with her lover. The scandal had 
abruptly ended van der Welcke 's career. Their 
passion was dead ; they blamed each other for 
their exile from Holland and respectability; 
their only pride was in their son, Adriaan ; and 
in regard to him each was jealous of the other. 
Finally, they decide to go home to The Hague 
in spite of everything; and at this point the 
novel begins. There is little that is large or 
kind or generous in the record of what follows. 
Adriaan, though a boy, is the only person who 
can be respected. He is compelled to maintain 
the balance between his father and mother and 
to witness their selfishly ineffectual attempts 
to rehabilitate themselves against the cruel 
opposition of the family and its circle. It is 
he who finds the just but bitter comment at 
the end, when the family is precipitated into a 
violent and vulgar quarrel. He says: "And 
all about nothing ! " A direct attack on a cer- 
tain sort of bourgeois society, by no means 
confined to Holland, could hardly be more 
pointed than "Small Souls," but the reader 
is not made unpleasantly conscious of the 
author's critical purpose. Mr. Couperus is 
not a tractarian in novelist 's clothes ; he is an 
exceptional artist in prose fiction.

TA.Afatonr.rt The , catalogue of Egyptological 
the literature of works lathered by Dr. Budge 01 
ra* the British Museum is length- 
ened anew by two brief popular treatises 
"written by request," "A History of the 
Egyptian People ' ' and ' ' The Literature of the 
Egyptians" (Button). The companion vol- 
umes are well printed, the illustrations are 
clear, and the colored frontispieces give a desir- 
able idea of the Egyptian use of color. The one- 
page map is, however, on too small a scale and 
deals with modern Egypt only, giving no clue 
even to the capitals, Memphis and Thebes, of 
the ancient nation with which Dr. Budge's 
history primarily deals. In tracing the po- 
litical career, the chapter-division puts into 
the "Middle Empire" the eighteenth and 
nineteenth dynasties, representing what is 
commonly counted the flower of the "New 
Empire, ' ' and includes under the latter head- 
ing everything which has occurred since then 
until to-day (from Cleopatra on in outline 
only) . Religion and daily life, saved for later 
chapters, lose much of their possible signifi- 
cance when thus divorced from the events of 
which they were the setting; and statements 
applying to different ages, grouped together, 
give an accurate impression of none. The 
chronology, of which the author takes an anti- 
quated and unwarrantably pessimistic view, 
is relegated to the final chapter. It is respon- 
sible for Dr. Budge's belief that Egypt bor- 
rowed from Babylonia the idea of such objects 
as the mace and the cylinder seal ; but, accord- 
ing to the most careful mjodern chronological 
research, civilization first grew up in Egypt. 
Some other superseded theories and occasional 
misstatements find a place, while results of 
recent years may be passed over. References 
in the bibliography at the end are not always 
to the latest edition or the latest treatise ; and 
the proof-reader had a grudge against German 
book-titles. As to literature, the reader who 
has hitherto had to search among such series as 
the "Library of the World's Best Literature" 
(a search well worth while) is indebted to Dr. 
Budge for the ' ' first attempt made to place be- 
fore the public a summary of the principal con- 
tents of Egyptian Literature in a handy and 
popular form." This volume is, however, 
unsystematically arranged, the religious ele- 
ment (which is excessively prominent) appear- 
ing at both ends as well as in the middle. In 
spite of this, the great hymn to Aton, in which 
King Amenhetep IV. sounded the key-note of 
the world's first monotheism, is not included. 
The author has often, wisely chosen para- 
phrase or synopsis in order to escape the 



wealth of inessential allusions which embellish 
the course of Egyptian documents. Where 
literal translations are incorporated, viola- 
tions of Egyptian grammatical principles and 
an often unjustified certainty of meaning are 
noticeable. Fortunately, the large aspects of 
Egyptian thought as presented in its litera- 
ture may be grasped without regard to these 
details. Dr. Budge has given us two neat and 
handy, but ill-digested, books. 



Columbia Correctly assuming that there is 

ttThirtwand no one educational institution in 
its problems. this country that can be called 
the great American University, and that some 
excel in one thing and others in another, Dean 
Keppel has successfully endeavored in his 
volume entitled "Columbia" (Oxford Univer- 
sity Press) to emphasize those matters in 
which his Alma Mater differs from her sister 
institutions and to pass over universal char- 
acteristics as briefly as possible. That was a 
happy scheme to adopt, for Columbia Uni- 
versity is nothing if not here and there unique. 
Founded in 1754, when Manhattan Island 
had fewer inhabitants than the University 
now has students, it grew irregularly until 
about 1890 ; since then its growth has been so 
nearly matchless that the present figures 
astound one: 54 departments of instruction, 
740 teachers, 3644 special students, 9929 regu- 
lar students, and buildings and grounds aggre- 
gating $54,000,000 in value and all of this 
in the city of New York. Dean Keppel sin- 
cerely deplores the large number of students ; 
and this is typical of the spirit of the entire 
book. It will readily be seen that, with such 
a plant, complicated as it is and consisting of 
schools within schools, educational problems 
have arisen and continue to arise, the solution 
of which is extraordinarily difficult, as well as 
provocative of feeling. All of these Dean 
Keppel discusses so logically and amiably 
that outsiders will be forced to admire and 
insiders to be patient with the trend of 
things at Morningside Heights. The book is, 
in a way, a contribution to the general history 
of education in this country, with an occa- 
sional lapse into pedagogical observations, one 
of which is not sufficiently elaborated: the 
relation of research to teaching. All will 
subscribe to the plea that is made for the good 
teacher. But lack of the time (and the inval- 
uable energy) for research by no means guar- 
antees good teaching. Indeed it just happens 
that in Dean Keppel's own Columbia, those 
particular men whose courses are uniformly 
voted the most useful (not simply the most 
popular) are, in the great majority of in- 
stances, the same men who are most interested

in and the most successfully engaged in re- 
search. Statistics concerning the men of 
research and the men of teaching in American 
universities might throw bright light on a 
dark issue. One omission on the historical 
side we note: the fact that there is no men- 
tion of Lorenzo da Ponte (1749-1838), the 
author of the librettos of Mozart's "Figaro," 
"Don Giovanni," and "Cosi fan tutte," who 
taught Italian at Columbia from 1828 on. The 
charming illustrations, pleasing style, and 
abundant humor, can only make all Columbia 
graduates rejoice over their opportunity to 
congratulate both the author and his theme. 

A Syrian stone- From the humble status of a 
aminist'e?in n<w Syrian artisan to the pastorate 
Boston. O f t^ Church of the Disciples in 

Boston is indeed "A Far Journey" (Hough- 
ton). The autobiographer, the Rev. Abraham 
Mitrie Rihbany, tells a story that is nattering 
to the American people. His change of scene 
and nationality involved a singularly perfect 
merging of his identity with that of ours, and 
he is in consequence enabled to interpret a 
childhood and youth passed at El-Shweir and 
Betater in the province of Mount Lebanon to 
us as such things have never been interpreted 
before. A member of the Orthodox Greek 
Church, his first instruction was received from 
one of its priests, afterward supplemented by 
a brief but pregnant period under American 
Presbyterian missionaries. His father was a 
stone-mason, and he followed the custom of the 
country by learning the ancestral trade. But 
he was destined for better things. Himself 
penniless, a school friend advanced the money 
needed to bring him to America, and he 
landed in New York only twenty years ago, 
unable to speak the language and too little 
experienced in the world's ways to earn any- 
thing but the most desultory livelihood either 
in or out of the little Syrian colony of those 
days. His experiences included clerking in a 
store owned by one of his countrymen, unsuc- 
cessful attempts to peddle silk, and the edit- 
ing of a Syrian newspaper printed in Arabic ! 
It took no very long time for him to realize 
that life among his own people, though in 
America, was not contributing to his under- 
standing of his adopted country, and he set 
forth upon a long odyssey, during which he 
acquired some formal education and actually 
taught himself the gift of fluent speaking and 
preaching in English by assiduous lecturing, 
often in churches and Sunday-schools. The 
difficulties that attended his upward march 
are not set forth with any fullness, but enough 
is told to make it quite apparent that he had 
a much harder time than his good taste per- 



mits him to disclose. At last, to his surprise, 
he was asked to accept a pastorate in a west- 
ern church, not to preach dogma, though he 
had betaken himself from Greek Orthodoxy to 
an unrigorous Protestantism before leaving 
Syria, but to set forth religion as learned from 
the mouth of Jesus himself in the Gospels. It 
is a marvellous recital, this bridging of the 
thousands of years that separate Turkey and 
the United States, and one that every true 
American can read with almost as great a 
pride as the teller of the story must feel. 



In a sleepy corner of France 

A summer tramp P 

in southwestern most remote from the present 
scene of Anglo-Franco-German 
strife, and months before the first mutterings 
of the coming storm, three British pedes- 
trians, with knapsacks on their backs, made a 
pilgrimage, during which they slept in well- 
nigh a score of wayside inns, saw not a single 
city, and met scarcely half a dozen persons 
who could speak a word of anything but the 
native idiom. " Vagabonds in Perigord" 
(Houghton), by Mr. H. H. Bashford, is a 
book whose pages fairly shimmer with the 
heat of that midsummer tramp through 
Correze and Dordogne and Gironde the fa- 
tigues of the journey as well as its delights 
figuring prominently in the intimate narrative 
of the tramp-historian. The author, Sophronia 
his wife, and Justin the visionary, make up 
the party, although of the corporeality of 
Justin one is left in strong doubt at the end, 
where it is written: "But to tell the truth 
we had both become a little tired of Justin; 
and we resolved to slay him as we had re- 
solved to slay him so many times before. For 
what was he, after all, but a mood to be now 
and then inhabited a poor husk of a fellow, 
always chasing just a yard or two behind life ? 
So we watched him fade until presently we 
could see the star or two that he had been 
blotting, and the remote lamp of a steamer 
outward bound." Peacefully bucolic though 
the book's atmosphere is, there is one jangling 
note where Justin broaches at the dinner- 
table the subject of the proposed three-years 
military service, and further urges that the 
enlightened of all nations are really brethren 
for whom frontier boundary lines have ceased 
to exist. "But if Justin had believed this to 
be an olive-branch, it was his last and greatest 
error. . . . They slapped their foreheads. Was 
war of the intellect ? They smote their waist- 
coats. It was an affaire de cceur. For any man 
with sensibilities higher in grade than a 
potato's, there were conditions, they yelled, 
under which death was infinitely preferable 
to life such conditions as had always ren-

dered, and to the world's end would still 
render, the declaration of war a never-out-of- 
sight liability." Thus was the fiery Gascon 
blood seen to boil up even in peaceful Peri- 
gord. Mr. Bashford is an artist in light and 
humorous narrative; also an artist with his 
pencil, as shown, if we mistake not, in the 
pleasing cover-design to his book and in the 
old-fashioned map, half topography, half 
quaint illustration, that is printed on the end 
leaves and bears his initials in one corner. 



In the land 
of perpetual 
revolution. 



Compared with the stern reality 
of the present European con- 
flict it is little more than a 
comic-opera warfare that Mr. John Reed, war 
correspondent in the rebellion-torn republic to 
the south of us, pictures in his peculiarly 
jaunty manner in the volume entitled "Insur- 
gent Mexico" (Appleton). When, for in- 
stance, the Federal commander at Zacatecas 
City telegraphs to General Velasco at Torreon 
his brilliant scheme of letting the Constitu- 
tionalists take the city and then recapturing 
it from them because it is an easier place to 
attack than to defend, how can such tactics be 
regarded seriously as illustrations of orthodox 
military science? In the following excerpt 
we get a glimpse of the foremost Constitu- 
tionalist general recreating himself after his 
arduous duties at the front. The scene is an 
improvised bull ring. "Villa would walk 
right up to the pawing, infuriated animal, 
and, with his double cape, slap him insolently 
across the face, and, for half an hour, would 
follow the greatest sport I ever saw. Some- 
times the sawed-off horns of the bull would 
catch Villa in the seat of the trousers and 
propel him violently across the ring ; then he 
would turn and grab the bull by the head and 
wrestle with him with the sweat streaming 
down his face until five or six companeros 
seized the bull's tail and hauled him plowing 
and bellowing back." In striking contrast 
with the rollicking boyishness and rough-and- 
ready forcefulness of "Pancho" Villa are the 
pompous ineffectually and wooden stiffness 
of the nominal commander-in-chief, Venusti- 
ano Carranza, as he appears to us in Mr. 
Reed's pages, holding himself aloof in an 
absurd unapproachability, surrounded and 
guarded from molestation by officious cabinet 
members and other diplomatic gentlemen, and 
all the while leaving "Villa strictly alone, to 
undergo defeats if he must, or make mistakes ; 
so much so that Villa himself was forced to 
deal with foreign powers as if he were the 
head of the government. ' ' The book helps one 
to understand recent developments in the 
mutual relations of these two men, and at the 



same time conveys vivid and presumably 
truthful impressions of Mexican life and Mex- 
ican people in the midst of rebellion. 



The popular 



Professor E. G. Cox has per- 
formed a welcome service in 
turning into English the val- 
uable work of the Danish scholar, Dr. Johannes 
Steenstrup, on the ballad, now issued from 
the press of Ginn & Co. under the title of 
"The Medieval Popular Ballad." This vol- 
ume first appeared at Copenhagen in* 1891, 
and has Avon general recognition among 
scholars. It is based on Grundtvig's famous 
collection of Danish ballads a collection 
larger even than that of our own Professor 
Child but it is nevertheless of considerable 
importance to the English student by reason 
of the light that it reflects on the history and 
nature of the English ballad. The prime aim 
of Dr. Steenstrup was to ascertain and set 
forth the main characteristics of the ballad 
as it originally flourished in Denmark. Inci- 
dentally he endeavors to bring out certain 
spurious elements that have crept into the 
ballad in more modern times or that are to be 
found in certain ballads of comparatively 
recent origin which had erroneously been ad- 
mitted into the canon by Grundtvig. His 
conclusions with respect to the origin and 
nature of the Danish ballad are in striking 
accord with the views now generally accepted 
with respect to the English ballad. The 
Danish ballad, he shows, is remarkable first of 
all for its objectivity; it had its origin in 
songs of the folk accompanied by dancing; it 
is extremely fond of the refrain; it is crude 
and irregular both in its rhythms and in its 
rhymes; it is averse to alliteration as an 
organic element, but employs parallelism oc- 
casionally, and is fond of repetition ; it avoids 
nature except for purposes of background ; it 
abhors didactic elements and abstractions of 
every sort; it is incomparably plain and 
simple in its style. The ballad first flourished 
in Denmark, so Dr. Steenstrup concludes, in 
the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. One 
is impressed throughout with the frankness 
and earnestness displayed by this Danish 
scholar. The style of Professor Cox's transla- 
tion is admirably lucid and forthright, and it 
is perfect in its idiom. 



The ancient 
civilizations 
of Mexico. 



"Mexican Archaeology: An In- 
troduction to the Archaeology of 
the Mexican and Mayan Civili- 
zations of Pre-Spanish America" (Putnam) 
is a fat octavo volume filled with illustrations 
and containing a useful map, which Mr. 
Thomas A. Joyce has prepared for the use of

students. It is filled to bursting with facts, 
solid, substantial, undeniable facts, carrying 
the knowledge the world has been able to 
recover of the lost civilizations of Mexico 
down to the most recent discoveries. As an 
instance of the German method of thorough- 
ness in this field, the author says in his 
Preface, "the torch has passed to Germany" 
it deserves all praise; as a specimen of 
literature it is perhaps more readable than an 
unabridged dictionary. Its appeal is to the 
student, interested in facts; to the casual 
reader who wishes a running account of these 
elder Americans that will hold his atten- 
tion and give him in reasonable space the 
truth about them, it is hard reading. Take 
the question of Aztec cannibalism, which pre- 
vious writers have led us to suppose was the 
usual sequence of the offering of human vic- 
tims to the gods. It is rather important, if 
we are to form an idea of the civilization of 
the ancient Mexican. Mr. Joyce mentions it, 
rather casually, in only two places, thus: 
"Sacrifice was sometimes accompanied by 
cannibalism " (p. 67) . " The very cannibalism 
which, to a limited extent, formed the occa- 
sional sequel to human sacrifice, becomes di- 
vested of much of its horror when it is remem- 
bered that the rite was, in essentials, an act 
of communion with the deity, with whom the 
victim was identified" (p. 82). This does 
not appear to cover the ground adequately, 
and gives rise to a suspicion that, like Pres- 
cott the historian and Wallace the romancer, 
the author desires to gloss over the darkest 
chapter in Aztec annals. This impression 
remains after finishing the book. The ' ' civili- 
zation" described was a red Indian savagery, 
dominated by gross superstitions from which 
more northern tribes were comparatively free. 
The Aztecs were pueblo Indians whose per- 
formances in the arts should not be allowed to 
blind the modern mind to the realities of their 
daily life and worship. 



An observer Americans have seldom been 
of immigrants given a better chance to see 

to America. , i . , , , 

themselves as others see them 
than in the interesting view given of portions 
of the country by Mr. Stephen Graham in 
"With Poor Immigrants to America" (Mac- 
millan). We could wish for our own sakes 
that Mr. Graham had not had the experiences 
so picturesquely set forth in his previous 
work, "With the Russian Pilgrims to Jerusa- 
lem," since the contrast with Russian spir- 
ituality in its most self-sacrificing mood is 
more than a little hard on American material- 
ism. The author took passage from England 
in the steerage, and there met all sorts and 



conditions of about-to-be Americans. This he 
followed by tramping from New York to Chi- 
cago with means to pay his way. His impres- 
sions are gained by personal contact, and not 
by reading, and they are as interesting to read 
as they must have been to undergo. Mr. Gra- 
ham is sympathetic with our endeavors to 
better the conditions of those who come among 
us from European shores, but hardly as sym- 
pathetic as he is with the Russian immigrants 
whose fellows he had learned to admire in his 
earlier journeyings through their great em- 
pire and down to the Holy Land. But he is 
fair, and he leans always toward constructive 
criticism. An instance of the shrewdness of 
his observation may be given : After discrim- 
inating between "the great multifarious, un- 
formed mass of the people" and "the strong, 
emancipated, cultured American nation," he 
goes on to describe "the fat American, clever 
enough to bluff even the Jew the strange 
emerging bourgeois type of what I call the 
'white nigger,' low-browed, heavy-cheeked, 
thick-lipped, huge-bodied, but white; men 
who seem made of rubber so elastic they are ; 
men who seem to get their thoughts from 
below upward. . . . On the whole, the dry, 
lean Americans are the most trustworthy and 
honorable among the masses of the people. In 
England we trust fat men, men 'who sleep o' 
nights,' but in America one prefers the lean 
man. ... Of course too much stress might 
easily be laid on the unpleasantness of the 
'white-nigger' type. There are plenty of 
them who are true gentlemen." This is as 
hard upon the American negro of the better 
sort as it is upon the fat man, of course, but 
it is given from a foreign point of view and is 
suggestive of more than it says. This is gen- 
erally true of the book, which is admirably 
written and decorated with bite of natural 
description truly poetic in feeling. 



The fair sex Personal experience and obser- 
in the land of vation in the land of the Pha- 
whs - raohs form the basis of Mrs. 
Elizabeth Cooper's varied and instructive 
chapters entitled, collectively, "The Women 
of Egypt" (Stokes), but covering a far wider 
range of topics than this title would indicate ; 
for the manners and customs, the religion and 
the superstitions, the industries and the 
amusements, of the people in general are de- 
scribed or touched upon in the course of the 
book, while a multitude of illustrations of all 
sorts emphasizes the volume's pleasing variety. 
Recording little but what she herself has seen 
or has heard from the natives, Mrs. Cooper 
inspires confidence in her trustworthiness as 
a writer on present-day conditions in the

country visited by her with the express pur- 
pose, as she says, of trying "to learn some- 
thing of the life of the Egyptian woman. I 
did not expect," she adds, "to fully under- 
stand her, but I wanted to know as much as 
is possible for a woman of that hurrying, 
bustling, new country, America, to know of 
the slow, lethargic woman of the Orient. I 
realized that the foundation of our knowledge 
of a people must be an understanding of their 
country, for social structure depends primarily 
upon labour, and labour is determined by 
place." To the part played by the shut-in 
woman of the harem is ascribed an exag- 
gerated importance, it must seem to many 
readers, by this friendly and sympathetic 
observer, who even begins her book with these 
words: "As go the women of Egypt, so goes 
Egypt." And yet she herself admits the in- 
security of woman's place in the Egyptian 
household and hence in the larger social 
scheme. Divorces are the rule and not the 
exception, the husband having the right to put 
away his wife and try a new one for no 
sufficient cause, as well as the privilege of 
plural wives up to the prescribed Mohamme- 
dan limit. But there are signs of better things 
in the future for the patient women of the 
Nile. England's administration seems to tend 
to their uplifting, and the education of girls 
is there making fine headway. One cannot 
wish to see orientalism rudely ousted by occi- 
dentalism, but rather some needed reforms 
introduced in the old order. That this process 
is now going on among the women of Egypt 
becomes apparent from a reading of Mrs. 
Cooper's excellent account of her extended 
sojourn in that country. 



The adventurous ^ ost opportune and worthy of 
men who have high praise is Mr. F. Lauriston 
le8 - Bullard's "Famous War Corre- 
spondents" (Little, Brown & Co.). The pro- 
found interest commanded by the greatest 
war in history, coupled with the meagreness 
of the details of its battles, has called especial 
attention not only to the present task of war 
correspondents but to their past achieve- 
ments. The place of honor is here rightly 
given to Sir William Howard Russell, whose 
dispatches from the Crimea changed the 
thought of a nation and caused the fall of a 
British government. Thereafter appear valu- 
able judgments upon Archibald Forbes, Janu- 
arius Aloysius MacGahan, Frederick Villiers 
(still alive and sketching near the front to- 
day), Bennet Burleigh, Edmond 'Donovan, 
the five Vizetellys, Edward Frederick Knight, 
the lamented George Warrington Steevens, 
Winston Spencer Churchill (now first lord of 



the admiralty), and James Creelman. It 
would be difficult to select modern careers as 
interesting in the fullest sense of the word as 
several of these, even from among those who 
fought rather than described fighting. There 
follows a most interesting and unexpected 
chapter on George Wilkins Kendall and his 
fellow-correspondents of the war with Mexico 
in 1846-7, wherein it is conclusively demon- 
strated that the free press of America was the 
first to recognize and utilize the services of 
reporters in the field. The concluding chap- 
ters are devoted, respectively, to the work 
done by Americans in the Civil War and in 
the Spanish-American War. The Preface 
mentions the names of many more who might 
have been included had the size of the book 
permitted, while the treatment accorded those 
mentioned justifies their exclusion. It makes 
a better book for detailing the history of 
these than it could have been if there had 
been a larger inclusion with the meagre 
sketchiness necessarily ensuing. Portraits of 
all the men mentioned are used as illustra- 
tions. 

The latest addition to the 

The political . ,, 

career of Heroes of the Nations series 

is devoted to "Demosthenes and 
the Last Days of Greek Freedom" (Putnam). 
The author is Mr. A. W. Pickard-Cambridge 
of Balliol College, Oxford ; and his work has 
been well done. In such a series there must 
be a little temptation now and then to make 
one's theme fit harmoniously into the general 
plan ; but in the present instance Demos- 
thenes is treated with an unflinching hand. 
Of course he was an orator before he was a 
statesman, and he was often a politician after 
he became a statesman ; he had many obvious 
weaknesses, which are not blinked by the 
author; but after all he was the protagonist, 
the hero, in the tragic conflict against the 
rising power of Philip of Macedonia. And 
what a drama it makes, the course of events 
from the Peace of Antalcidas (387-6) to the 
battle of Chaeroneia (338). Naturally the 
supreme tragedy is the travail and defeat of 
Athens; but even after Chaeroneia there is 
scarcely less tragedy in the struggle and death 
of her foremost champion sixteen years later. 
And it must be a stout-hearted imperialist, 
indeed, who can study this period without 
strange flutterings about the heart. The 
present reviewer, certainly, who has worked 
in this field for many years, must confess 
that he laid aside the present studious and 
unemotional treatise with a feeling unpar- 
donably akin to tears. It is a pleasure to 
commend the volume to intelligent readers 
who would care to follow "the last struggle

that is thoroughly sane and represents scholar- 
ship without pedantry. It ought to be noted 
that there are twenty-nine illustrations, in- 
cluding an excellent map, and, in addition, a 
convenient chronological table, a fair bibli- 
ography in the prefatory note, and an index 
that proved reliable in so far as it was tested.

more partisan than our own. The English 
are very like us. Mr. A. C. Gardiner's collec-

and from the Jam Sahib of Nawanagar to Sir 
Johnston Forbes-Robertson. Mr. Gardiner is 
doubtless more of a party man than appears 
to the American reader not too familiar with 
English politics, but, granted that his bias is 
toward Mrs. Despard rather than toward Mrs. 
Ward and toward Mr. Lloyd George rather 
than toward Mr. Andrew Carnegie, he seems 
an uncommonly fair man, with a catholic 
taste in personality, and he writes very well. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Miss Jesse Bonstelle and Miss Marian de Forest 
have found little matter of importance for " Little 
Women Letters from the House of Alcott " (Little, 
Brown & Co.), but they have made a book which 
vividly recalls the creator of " Little Women." 
Two facsimiles of letters from Bronson Alcott to 
his daughter, Louisa May Alcott, and one of a 
letter to another daughter, are included. 

Three new volumes of the "Loeb Classical 
Library" (Macmillan) have recently come to hand. 
The two in the Latin section are Vol. II. of Sue- 
tonius, which completes "The Lives of the Caesars" 
and " The Lives of Illustrious Men," and Cicero's 
" De Fiuibus Bonorum Et Malorum " ; the one in 
the Greek section is the first volume of a two- 
volume edition of Xenophon's " Cyropasdia." Pro- 
fessor J. C. Rolfe is the translator of Suetonius, 
Mr. H. Raekham of Cicero, and Mr. Walter Miller 
of Xenophon. 



NOTES. 



The publication of Mr. Compton Mackenzie's 
novel, " Sinister Street," has been postponed until 
next spring. 

" Short Stories in the Making," by Professor 
Robert W. Neal, is announced by the Oxford Uni- 
versity Press. 

Professor Max Reinhardt has promised to come 
to this country in the near future as the guest of 
the Stage Society of New York. 

Mrs. Havelock Ellis's " Love Acre : An Idyll 
in Two Worlds " is announced by Mr. Mitchell 
Kennerley as immediately forthcoming. 

A volume of short stories by " Maxime Gorky," 
dealing with life in Italy and Russia, will be 
brought out shortly in English translation by Mr. 
B. W. Huebsch. 

" The Three Sisters," the forthcoming novel of 
Miss May Sinclair, is announced by the Macmillan 
Co. as a study, by means of dramatic incidents, of 
three distinct types of womanhood. 

" Rada," a play by Mr. Alfred Noyes revealing 
the un-Christian character of war and presenting 
scenes from the recent Balkan conflict, will soon be 
published in book form by Messrs. Stokes. 

To the series of modern monographs which Mr. 
Martin Seeker is issuing in London have been 
added " Robert Bridges, a Critical Study," by Mr. 
F. E. Brett Young, and " Maurice Maeterlinck, a 
Critical Study," by Miss Una Taylor. 

Mr. Arnold Bennett's latest volume of travel 
bears the title " From the Log of the Velsa," and 
will be published shortly by the Century Co. The 
frontispiece in color is by the author, and other 
illustrations are by Mr. E. A. Rickards. 

The war has caused Mr. Hilaire Belloc to change 
many of his plans, and it is improbable that he 
will decide to come to this country, as he originally 
intended, for an extensive lecturing tour through 
the principal cities in the course of the late autumn 
and winter. 

Professor William Lyon Phelps's " Essays on 
Books " is promised for immediate issue by Messrs. 
Macmillan. In it he treats Jane Austen, Dickens, 
Browning, Schopenhauer, Richardson, and many 
others in the same light and entertaining fashion 
employed by him in his earlier collection of talks 
on present-day novelists. 

The natural history of Africa will be enriched 
this fall with two important contributions. Mr. 
Theodore Roosevelt's " Life-histories of African 
Game Animals " will soon be published by Messrs. 
Scribner ; " The Natural History of South Africa," 
by Mr. F. W. Fitzsimmons, will come from the 
press of Messrs. Longmans, Green & Co. 

Those of Mr. Galsworthy's readers who have 
learned to watch for the rare flashes of insight 
into the animal world that he reveals in almost 
all his novels will welcome a volume devoted en- 
tirely to a sympathetic treatment of the life of 
the lower kingdom. His latest book, " Memories," 
which is issued this month by Messrs. Scribner, 
gives an account of the history of a favorite 
spaniel.

THE DIAL 



307 



With the publication of the second and final 
volume of " George III. and Charles Pox," by Sir 
George Otto Trevelyan, now published by Messrs. 
Longmans, Green & Co., is brought to a close the 
series of six volumes, of which the first four were 
entitled " The American Revolution." They con- 
stitute a narrative of the events in England and 
on the Continent which had a bearing on the con- 
flict in America. 

Several books on California are promised for the 
season, and gain timeliness in view of the Exposi- 
tion of next year. Mrs. Gertrude Atherton is 
Californian-born, and in her forthcoming volume, 
" The Story of California," to be .published by 
Messrs. Harper, she deals with the history of the 
state from its earliest geological beginnings and 
emphasizes many important phases of its vividly 
picturesque story. 

" The Cornhill Booklet," a little magazine which 
made its first appearance in 1900 and ran for five 
years, has resumed publication. 9 The October issue, 
the first which now appears, contains a poem by 
Mr. Percy MacKaye, a little known poem of Leigh 
Hunt, and hitherto unpublished fragments from 
Oscar Wilde's " De Profundis." Future numbers 
will have uncollected material of Thackeray, Lan- 
dor, Robert Louis Stevenson, and others. 

With the December number of this year " The 
Bibelot " will be concluded, as the series of twenty 
volumes, originally planned, will then be complete. 
Mr. Thomas B. Mosher, the editor and publisher, 
has met with admirable success in his purpose to 
offer to lovers of good literature a reprint of 
poetry and prose, chosen from scarce and gen- 
erally unknown editions and sources, which com- 
bines inexpensiveness with choice typography. 

Mme. Lilli Lehmann's " Mv Path through Life," 
Mr. Arthur E. P. B. Weigall's "The Life and 
Times of Cleopatra," and two new volumes in the 
" Heroes of the Nations " series, dealing with 
Alfred of England and Isabella the Cathdlic, are 
among the biographies announced by Messrs. Put- 
nam. The publication of another biography on 
Messrs. Putnam's list, Mr. James Hamilton Wylie's 
" The Reign of Henry V.," was erroneously attrib- 
uted to Messrs. E. P. Button & Co. when the first 
volume of the work was reviewed in a recent issue 
of THE DIAL. 

A new edition of " Golden Poems," compiled by 
Francis Fisher Browne, the founder of THE DIAL, 
conies from the press of Messrs. A. C. McClurg & 
Co. It is entirely reprinted and was enlarged, 
brought down to date, and completely revised by 
the compiler. Printed on India paper and issued 
in two bindings, flexible cloth and morocco with 
red-under-gold edges, it promises to be one of the 
notable holiday books of the season. The first 
edition appeared over thirty years ago, and, as a 
collection of the best poems by British and Ameri- 
can authors, has long been a general favorite. 

Among the titles on the fall announcement list 
of the Methodist Book Concern are the following 
books of general interest : " Beside Lake Beauti- 
ful," by Bishop William A. Quayle; " The Prayer 
Life," by Dr. Andrew Murray; a new edition of 
" Men and Things I Saw in Civil War Days," by 



General James R. Rusling; "A Pilgrim of the In- 
finite," by Dr. William V. Kelley; "Christianity 
and the New Age," by Mr. George P. Mains; 
" Social Heredity and Social Evolution," by Pro- 
fessor H. W. Conn ; " Heroines of History," by 
Bishop Frank M. Bristol; "The Rural Church 
Movement," by Professor Edwin L. Earp ; " The 
Harps of the Gods and the Chords They Play," by 
Mr. George MacAdam ; and " Leaves of Life for 
Daily Inspiration," by Mrs. Margaret Bird Stein- 
metz. 

Two new volumes in " The Humanists' Library " 
are issued this season by The Merrymount Press. 
" Pico della Mirandola : A Platonick Discourse 
upon Love " appears in the English translation of 
Thomas Stanley, a contemporary of Milton, and 
is now edited by Mr. Edmund G. Gardner. Gio- 
vanni della Casa's " The Galateo of Manners and 
Behaviour " is reprinted from the English transla- 
tion made in 1516 by Robert Petersen, an English 
barrister. Mr. J. E. Spingarn, who is the editor 
of this unique and interesting old volume, supplies 
an Introduction on the Renaissance ideals of 
courtesy. 

Through arrangements with the London pub- 
lishers, Messrs. Hodder & Stoughton, a series of 
books about the war will be brought out imme- 
diately in this country by Messrs. Doran. Among 
the volumes, all of which are new books, are the 
following : " How Germany Makes War," by Gen- 
eral F. von Bernhardi ; " Liberty !" by Mr. Arnold 
Bennett ; " The German Army from Within," by 
a British officer; " The Russian Army from 
Within," by Mr. W. Barnes Stevens; "How the 
War Began," by Messrs. W. L. Courtney and J. M. 
Kennedy; " The Fleets at War," by Mr. Archibald 
Hurd ; " The Campaign of Sedan," by Mr. George 
Hooper ; " In the Firing Line," by Mr. A. St. 
John Adcock ; " The Campaign round Liege," by 
Messrs. W. L. Courtney and J. M. Kennedy ; " The 
Red Cross in War," by Miss M. F. Billington; 
and " Forty Years After," by Mr. H. C. Bailey.

interesting and intimate account of her exceptionally prominent life, politically and socially. Fol- 
lowing her husband's fortunes upon the many missions of trust into faraway parts of the world, and 
later living in the very heart of our own Washington life, Mrs. Taft has had exceptional opportunities 
to observe much of the personal side of political society, both abroad and at home. She writes of 
her life in the Philippines, in Europe, and later as the mistress of the White House.

On War To-day By General Friedrich von Bernhardi 

The most widely known and perhaps the greatest exponent of militarism to-day is General Friedrich 
von Bernhardi (retired) of the German Army. In these two volumes Bernhardi makes an exhaustive 
study of the art and practice of warfare under modern conditions and with modern engines of 
destruction. Why the Germans fight in masses, the strategy of enveloping movements, and of retire- 
ments, the advantage of superior mobility, the use of aeronautics, are fully explained and are espe- 
cially illuminating in view of actual developments in Europe. Moreover these volumes are in no 
way too technical for the un-military reader. The translator, a lieutenant of the German Army and 
the author himself of a book on tactics, has taken care to make his English simple and uninvolved. 
A number of sketches illustrating different types of strategic movements of troops aids the mental 
vision of the reader. General von Bernhardi's work is of the greatest interest and value to a com- 
prehension of the present vast struggle in Europe.

John Hay: Author and Statesman 

By Lorenzo Sears 

This sympathetic biography of John Hay, confidant of Lincoln, friend and right-hand man both of 
McKinley and Roosevelt, will help to keep alive the memory of a singularly gifted and singularly 
charming American gentleman. "The fine flower of our civilization," President McKinley called 
him; and President Roosevelt's tribute is: "The most charming man and delightful companion I 
have ever known."

McCLURG'S 

Books That Will Interest, Entertain, and Instruct 

Winning the Wilderness By MARGARET HILL MCCARTER 

A tale of the soil, of the wind-swept plains, of the hardships of pioneer life, of the upbuilding of the 
West, of love, sacrifice and triumph. 

Asher Aydelot one time United States soldier, and later soldier of civilization, took his young wife 
out to a homestead claim on the Kansas prairies, where everything was master but man. Here they fight 
against the deadly cold of the hard winters, the loneliness and solitude of the wild waste places, the 
scorching sun, the killing winds, the fearsome drought, and the devastating floods. Endurance and pluck, 
however, enable them to tame the prairie, and win the long fight against nature. Illustrated, by J. N, 
Marchand. Crown 8vo. Net $1.35. 

The House of the Dawn By MARAH ELLIS RYAN 

Exquisite beauty of style, rich descriptive passages, so filled with melody that they read like wonder- 
ful prose poems, mark this brilliant tale of Spanish Mexico by Marah Ellis Ryan. 

Essentially, however, is it a romance a romance of unusual quality of young love and courage. 
The love of one noble mind for another. The courage, born of high principle, that dares all for freedom 
and righteousness. Illustrated by Hanson Booth. Crown 8vo. Net $1.35. 

Marmaduke of Tennessee By EDWARD CUMMINGS 

The Civil War will provide a fascinating setting for a story as long as the story possesses that unde- 
finable element of power which grips and stirs the reader and leaves him glad for the reading, and cherish- 
ing pleasant memories of brave men, fair women and gallant deeds. 

Such a story is "Marmaduke of Tennessee," a war-time romance of such distinction that those 
privileged to read it in manuscript form have unreservedly called it "the best war story yet written." 
Illustrated by F. E. Schoonover. I2mo. Net $1.30. 

Kit Carson Days By EDWIN L. SABIN 

The story of "Kit Carson Days" is the story of the awakening of the vast and savage West; of white 
men and red men meeting, striving and mingling sometimes in friendly union, but far oftener in the struggle 
of mutual hate; of lonely camp; of thirst, starvation and deadly peril; of hardy trapper followed by trader; 
of gold seeker, colonist and settler; of the carrying forward of the flag across an unknown country two 
thousand miles wide until its stars were reflected in the waters of the smiling Pacific. Illustrated. Crown. 
8vo. Net $3.00. 

The French Revolution By H. PACKWOOD ADAMS 

Few subjects compare in point of interest with that epochal event in history, the French Revolution. 
The author of this book has tried to make the study of the Revolution attractive; to make known to his 
readers the results arrived at by great writers and thinkers, and to show the Revolution as part of a develop- 
ment that still continues, emphasizing the relation between economic justice and political freedom, ismo. 
Net $1.00. 

Myths and Legends of the Mississippi 

Valley and the Great Lakes By KATHARINE B. JUDSON 

The collection includes records made from recitals by members of the Winnebago, Chitimacha, 
Wyandot, Biloxi, Ojibwa, Mandan, Menomini, Ottawa, Cherokee, Choctaw and Knisteneaux Indian 
tribes, all well worthy of preservation. It gives in the original form many of the legends used by Long- 
fellow in "Hiawatha," and others as strikingly curious, quaint and poetical. Small quarto. Net $1.50. 

Indian Blankets and Their Makers By GEORGE WHARTON JAMES 

The Navaho Blanket, with its startling, almost barbaric, combination of bright colors, in which 
there is never a fault in the blending, is unique among Indian products. An ornamental and at the same 
time a very serviceable article. 

For more than thirty years the author of this work has known and studied the Navaho Indian and 
his blanket making. He has watched carefully the various developments of the art, has bought hundreds 
of blankets, and knows personally many of the best weavers of the tribe. He has produced a work that 
is exhaustive of the subject, interesting to the connoisseur and collector, but especially valuable to anyone 
who owns a Navaho blanket. Color and half-tone illustrations. Large Crown 8vo. Boxed. Net $5.00.

THE YOUNGER GENERATION. 



The younger generation has been slow to 
declare itself in America. Persons of an 
equable cynicism deny its existence. Those 
who conceive themselves to be making a last 
stand for the judiciary, the home, and Victo- 
rian literature have no doubt about it; and 
neither have the young poets who imagine 
they have in vented "poly-rhythmics, "nor the 
young idealists who believe that the Indus- 
trial Workers of the World are about to estab- 
lish the only true democracy. We find it 
difficult to cite names and titles as evidence 
that a new generation has begun to define and 
record itself in American literature. 

Among novelists, Mr. Robert Herrick 
hardly belongs to either the older or the 
younger generation. His career can be un- 
derstood only as the career of a man who has 
been caught between two generations so that 
he is handicapped by his sympathies with 
both. Mrs. Edith Wharton is almost as much 
a European as Mr. James ; at any rate she is 
a good deal less an American than Mr. How- 
ells; but, like him, she has chiefly studied a 
society that is passing rather than one that 
is just coming in. Mr. Theodore Dreiser is 
quite definitely placed by an accident of his 
youth. He discovered the realist idea in fic- 
tion and post-Darwinian materialism at the 
same time, or about twenty years after Mr. 
George Moore wrote "A Mummer's Wife." 
His long struggle to secure the publication of 
"Sister Carrie" confirmed him in that posi- 
tion, so that the only youthful quality he now 
possesses is the one which makes him think it 
worth while to spend himself in opposing 
American ideas of propriety in fiction. None 
of these three, certainly, is as clearly of the 
younger generation as is Mr. Arthur Bullard, 
the author of "A Man's World" and "Com- 
rade Yetta." It is his distinction that with- 
out being a propagandist, he is thoroughly at 
home with the emotions and the personalities 
of radicalism; and that without being him- 
self the son of foreign-born parents, he is 
able to envisage America as a country inhab- 
ited by others than New Englanders. But 
there is scarcely a single young novelist to 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1 



say nothing of a group whom we can place 
beside him. So far, he is an isolated case. 
The poets are more controversial than the 
novelists; it really matters to them whether 
one believes in Tennyson or in Mr. Ezra 
Pound; but the younger ones have written 
very little so far. The theatre offers no more 
evidence of a younger generation than poetry. 
Mr. Edward Sheldon, for instance, belongs to 
a new time as little as Mr. Percy MacKaye. 

Journalism is, perhaps, more promising 
than imaginative literature. Just now the 
names of several able young men are linked 
by the announcement of a weekly paper, 
' ' The New Republic, ' ' which proposes to criti- 
cize politics, education, and the arts. Mr. 
Herbert Croly, the editor, wrote his book, 
''The Promise of American Life," from the 
point of view of a man who feels that the only 
society worth having would be one in which 
individuality had the opportunity to develop 
freely. He believes that we have sacrificed 
that opportunity to economic efficiency. Mr. 
Walter Lippmann, just out of Harvard and 
the Socialist party, is impatient of current 
writing about politics and political theory. 
He pointed out, patiently enough, in his 
"A Preface to Politics," that our American 
faith in statutes is not at all justified by re- 
sults, that to reject syndicalism because it 
proposes violence is to ignore both its motive 
and its object, and that to write an elaborate 
report on vice without discussing the chief 
force involved is to accomplish very little. 
Mr. Francis Hackett has, we believe, never 
written a book. But he was the hero of an 
unusual journalistic exploit. 

Five or six years ago, Mr. Hackett discov- 
ered the enormous gap between the reviews in 
Chicago newspapers and those in London, 
papers like the "Nation," the "New Age," 
and the "Times Literary Supplement," and 
founded the "Friday Literary Review" of the 
Chicago "Evening Post." The experiment, 
in its originally effective form, was aban- 
doned nearly two years ago. But while it 
lasted Chicago had the opportunity to read 
in a daily newspaper criticism which endeav- 
ored to apply the standards and the methods 
of London weekly journalism. Mr. Hackett 
was genial about it, yet he had his fling at the 
pillars of the American novel while he intro- 
duced Chesterton, Shaw, Wells, and Bennett 
to a public which would have been much less 



appreciative of them without his assistance. 

But the possible list of American writers of 
the younger generation is nearly exhausted. 
And the few men we have mentioned may not 
be as promising as they seem. Mr. Bullard 
may never write a better novel than "A 
Man's World," or even another one as good. 
Mr. Croly, Mr. Lippmann, and Mr. Hackett 
may already have made their contributions, 
and not merely prepared the way for them. 
Why is the list so short? 

Mr. Croly would say that in America we 
have no tradition of free intellectual discus- 
sion. The newspapers, the magazines, and 
even the universities are afraid of the public ; 
their concern not to offend the majority com- 
mits them to the accepted view and prohibits 
iconoclasm. The result is that the younger 
generation faces not only all the handicaps it 
everywhere suffers, but also a well-supported 
taboo. The older generation holds all the van- 
tage points the editorships, the professorial 
chairs, the official positions which have 
naturally fallen to it. That is a matter of 
course. But its success in suppressing the 
militant minority is peculiarly American. 
As one of the younger men put it the other 
day, "It is not that we have nothing to say, 
or that we do not know how to say it. It is 
that we have no place in which to say it. ' ' 

The question whether that bitter statement 
of the case is any more true of the United 
States than it is of England or of Russia is 
perhaps irrelevant. There is enough truth in 
it to give it poignancy. For none of us would, 
in the abstract, deny youth a place in which 
"to say it," however coldly we might regard 
its desire to say a particular thing in a par- 
ticular place. The spectacle of youth strug- 
gling to give itself is sometimes comic ; but it 
is always a moving and, so far as its meaning 
can be read, a significant spectacle. 

The intelligent, therefore, regard such pa- 
pers as "The Masses," "The New Review," 
and "The International" with an interest out 
of all proportion to their achievement and 
probably with an interest out of all propor- 
tion to any rewards that have so far accrued 
to it. They await the first issues of "The 
New Republic" as impatiently as if they had 
not been many times disappointed. They 
watch for a new novelist or a new poet with 
as much concern as astronomers hoping to 
find a new star in the heavens.

SOME AMERICAN PICTURES IN THE, 
METROPOLITAN MUSEUM. 



American contemporary art has come more 
into the open, has attracted more of the at- 
tention of the world, . than our recent work 
in literature, music, or architecture. Pictures 
speak a universal language, they are not in- 
volved in the confusion of tongues. On the 
other hand they are somewhat stationary and 
not easy to multiply. Many of our best artists, 
however, have invaded Europe, and their suc- 
cess has reflected a consequence on the whole 
body of our art. School it can hardly be 
called. There have been the beginnings of 
schools among us, but our artists generally 
have taken their technique and aims from 
foreign masters, and often their themes from 
foreign life or scenes, so that there is not the 
family resemblance between them which we 
see in the great Italian and Dutch schools, or 
even in the English and French. 

The New York Metropolitan Museum is ex- 
traordinarily rich in good examples of Ameri- 
can art, though there are many artists un- 
represented who might well be in evidence, 
and though some of those present are not 
shown by their best work. The collection, 
however, gives a fair idea of our achievement 
in painting. Of course our wealth of work in 
mural decoration must be sought for else- 
where. 

Historically, the collection starts with our 
American primitives. Gilbert Stuart, Charles 
W. Peale, Thomas Sully, Henry Inman, and 
John Neagle. We might call this the brick- 
dust school; and there has surely been noth- 
ing like it in art before or since, unless the 
pictures on our magazine covers keep up its 
traditions. The brilliancy of the ladies' com- 
plexions, the floridness of the men's, the glit- 
ter of their noses, and the solidity of color in 
their clothes, startle and amaze. But the col- 
ors are laid on well; these portraits will re- 
tain their bloom for ages. Of all these artists 
Sully was the best. He had some idea of 
tone and much grace of drawing. There is an 
allegorical picture by Benjamin "West notice- 
able for one or two beautiful heads. And 
there is a picture by Washington Allston, 
"The Deluge," reminiscent of Poussin. It is 
in the opposite extreme from the cheerfulness 
of portrait painters a wall of gloom, with 
some scattered driftwood, drowned men, and 
eel-like serpents on the foreground. 

There is apparently nothing then until we 
come to John Kensett. His "Hudson River" 
is faithful but prosaic. The "JEgean Sea" 
of F. E. Church is pure, ideal landscape. It 
is a trifle theatrical perhaps, indicative of the 



Byronic backwash, but it is undeniably beauti- 
ful. And beauty which does not have to be 
argued about, or explained, or a taste culti- 
vated for it, is rare enough in art. Some of 
Thomas Cole's work also has this ante-modern 
note. 

These pictures strive for distinction. The 
modern note is struck in Eastman Johnson's 
"Two Men," which aims mainly at sincerity. 
It is a strongly painted piece of realism, the 
realism which does not demand low themes or 
repulsive types. 

Perhaps there is a somewhat similar con- 
trast of aim between Alexander Wyant's "An 
Old Clearing" and Worthington Whittredge's 
"Evening in the Woods." Wyant's picture 
is absolutely true and faithful. But it is a 
trifle cold, untouched with emotion; whereas 
Whittredge's landscape is not only rich in 
tone but is flooded with sentiment. 

We get a combination of the real and the 
ideal in George Inness. His "Autumn Oaks" 
and "Delaware Valley," though small in 
scale, can stand comparison with the work of 
Rousseau and Diaz. His great "Evening" is 
unique and has tremendous qualities. The 
elements of the picture are simple, a mass of 
shadowy ground and foliage against the still 
glowing evening sky. This is a work of con- 
centration. His "Peace and Plenty," how- 
ever, is a huge, scattered thing. It is hardly 
more than a piece of topography, and not very 
good topography at that, for the central group 
of trees must be about three hundred feet 
high. 

With the "Evening" of Inness may be com- 
pared and contrasted Mr. Ralph Blakelock's 
"Pipe Dancers." It is thoroughly American 
in scene and subject : Indians, clothed in red, 
are dancing in the twilight which is growing 
up around them, while overhead between long 
lines of trees a rich sunset is fading away. 
We have some doubt as to whether the top and 
bottom of the picture quite synchronize, as 
they do in that of Inness. 

With less grasp of reality than Inness, 
George Fuller carried the power of sugges- 
tion to an even higher degree. He does not go 
quite so far as the old tapestry work described 
by Shakespeare, "And for Achilles' image 
stood his spear, " but a full meaning is brought 
out by the slightest means. His "Nydia" is a 
slender girl with flesh tints lighted by an un- 
usual glare, fascinating in her air of expecta- 
tion. In "And She Was a Witch" a whole 
drama is brought out in the shadow by half- 
hinted figure the richly attired woman 
shrinking under the trees, the passers-by with 
scornfully averted looks. And this is not 
"literary" painting. Fuller's technique 



326 



THE DIAL 



[ Nov. 1 



seems to have been self-originated, unless there 
is in it a far-off reflection of Rembrandt. 

The whole question of "the subject" in 
painting is brought up by E. A. Abbey's large 
picture "King Lear." Against the telling of 
stories in paint may be urged the fact that 
these stories have to be known or explained. 
A work of art, we may think, ought to be an 
intelligible whole in itself; it ought not to 
have to hang on to some book or tradition or 
invention foreign to its own resources. It is 
quite certain, however, that, in the great ages 
of art, painters were best satisfied to tell sto- 
ries or illustrate religious or secular themes. 
The mere landscapist or portraitist was of 
secondary account. And to-day our great 
new school of mural artists paint allegories of 
their own invention which have to be ex- 
plained. They seem to think that, granting 
the necessary technical equipment, the more 
thought and meaning you can put into a pic- 
ture the better. We think that Abbey's work 
justifies "the subject." It is rich in tone, 
magnificent in pattern, and the attitudes, ges- 
tures, and faces of the principal figures are 
most expressive and illumining. 

"William M. Hunt has two single figure pic- 
tures which, if we remember rightly, are 
designs for one of his wall paintings. These 
figures are modelled with remarkable smooth- 
ness of painting and are intended to show 
clearly at a distance. 

John La Farge is represented by a beauti- 
fully harmonized piece of color, "The Muse 
of Painting." It gives one somewhat of the 
impression of a poem by Keats. That other 
American colorist, Mr. Albert P. Ryder, has 
two small pieces, "The Bridge" and "Smug- 
glers' Cove," which, though good, hardly give 
the measure of his remarkable talent. 

Mr. Theodore Robinson's "Girl and Cow" 
is very French of the "plein-air" school. 
Mr. Jonas Lie's "The Conqueror" is a pic- 
ture of the Culebra cut, Panama, but as far as 
truth to nature is concerned probably more 
closely resembles one of the canals in Mars. 
It is a purely symbolical picture, as much so 
as Mr. Arthur B. Davies's frank allegory 
"The Girdle of Ares" on a near wall. 

There is a female study by Mr. Abbot H. 
Thayer of the same type as his ' ' Virgin ' ' and 
the "Woman and Child" in the Boston Mu- 
seum. A large ideality looks out of his pic- 
tures, yet they have an abundance of physical 
life. 

Mr. Alphonse Jonglewis's "Louise" strik- 
ingly recalls Whistler's portrait of Miss Alex- 
ander. It is not so simple and austere as that 
masterpiece, but we think the beflowered hat 



lights up the figure wonderfully. We are not 
so sure about the parrot. 

Mr. Childe Hassam's picture reveals an in- 
dividual view of nature all strong light or 
shadow left out, but, as in Corot, the values 
true in their condensed scale. 

Homer Martin is one of our best land- 
scapists, and his work with the line of slender 
trees recalls Hobbema. It is not pleasant to 
be always noting resemblances, but Mr. 
Thomas W. Dewing 's "The Letter" is an 
Americanized Vermeer. Mr. Frederick W. 
Waugh 's two pictures, ' ' The Great Deep ' ' and 
"The Roaring Forties," open-sea paintings of 
great power, are original enough. So too is 
Robert MacCameron's "The Daughter's Re- 
turn," which is almost the last word in squalid 
realism, but painted with great conviction. 

We now come to the major gods of the col- 
lection, or, first, to one who is at least a Titan. 
The four or five pictures of Winslow Homer, 
which are hung together, smite the eyes like a 
revelation. We cannot say that we have ever 
seen foam without air in it, as in these white 
walls and crawling lines of white, but prob- 
ably this simplification is intentional. A sim- 
ilar treatment of broken water is given in the 
"Shooting the Rapids" in another room. 
What Homer aimed to render was the force 
and instantaneousness of water in violent mo- 
tion. Compare his treatment with that of 
Mr. Paul Dougherty in "Surf." Here the 
foam is piled in soft mounds of snow, sunlight 
smitten, or withdraws in transparent green 
lines. Mr. Dougherty gives more facts than 
Homer and they are beautifully assembled, 
but the chief facts of all, the fury of the charg- 
ing sea and the indomitable defence of the 
rocks, are in Homer's pictures rather than in 
his. Homer's "Gulf Stream" is painted, one 
may say, in the grand style. There is an accu- 
mulation of horrors in it, but it fascinates ; it 
establishes that invisible tether which every 
really remarkable picture attaches to the spec- 
tator, drawing him back to it again and again. 

Mr. Sargent and Whistler are of course the 
trump cards of this American collection, but 
the Museum has not been particularly fortu- 
nate in securing first-rate examples of either. 
Mr. Sargent's portrait of Mr. William Chase 
is a brilliant work. The figure bristles with vi- 
tality and seems to have been done with a few 
swirls of the brush. The head of the ' ' Gitana ' ' 
is profoundly painted, but the rest of the pic- 
ture is naught. As for the "Hermit" we con- 
fess we give up any attempt to understand it. 
The hermit seems to have been flayed and his 
cuticle distributed over the landscape. The 
picture does not hold together from any point 
of view. It might have been painted in a 



1914] 



THE DIAL

world where there are four or five different 
colored suns whirling above the horizon at 
once. What sentiment of reverence or irrever- 
ence inspired the painting of the Hermit him- 
self, who pops up like an emaciated earthworm 
from a hole in the lower corner of the picture, 
we shall probably never know. 

Whistler's "Lady of the Yellow Buskin "in 
Philadelphia is a great picture. His portraits 
of his mother and of Carlyle are truth itself, 
albeit so quiet and unemphasized. But the 
three portraits in the New York Museum are 
questionable things. The elimination of the 
non-essential was Whistler's guiding rule. 
But flesh and blood are surely essential to good 
portrait painting. The "Connie Gilchrist" 
and the "Henry Irving" are ghosts, graceful 
and charming ghosts, for whom we may be 
grateful, but certainly not human beings. The 
M. Duret is alive, though hardly more so than 
a large tinted photograph would be. Meier- 
Graefe says that this gentleman has no bones 
and is held up by his trousers. Whistler is 
said to have painted it, in a sort of wager 
with himself, to show that modern male attire 
could be made interesting. He compromised, 
however, with the lady 's cloak which M. Duret 
is carrying, and which is surely no more a part 
of his personality than a toga or Elizabethan 
trunks would be. ' ' Cremorne Garden No. 2 " isi 
a company of fashionably attired ghosts taking 
the air in some absolutely undefined region. 
It may be objected that we have no right to ask 
an artist for more than he chooses to give us 
that if we get grace, refinement, charm, as we 
do in all these pictures of Whistler, we ought 
to be satisfied. So we ought, if the artist is 
content with the rank which these qualities 
give him. But Whistler acclaimed himself, 
and has been acclaimed by others, the equal of 
the mightiest ; and so we have the right to say 
that, compared with the work of the great men, 
these particular pictures are mere washed-out 
prettinesses. Nor have we ever been able much 
to believe in his "Nocturnes." Rembrandt 
painted not with colors but with the primal 
fire and darkness of the world. But he never 
allowed his fire to be swallowed up by his 
darkness. His subject and figures are always 
made out. That anything is made out in 
Whistler's "Nocturne in Green and Gold," 
we very much doubt. 

Inness, Fuller, Homer, Sargent, and Whis- 
tler, these seem to be the high notes in Amer- 
ican painting, at least as revealed in this col- 
lection. Poet souls the first two, who on the 
dark ages of our art wrought out visions of 
lasting beauty. A veritable Thor the third, 
who really does take the kingdom of art by 
violence. The fourth is a wizard of paint, 



complete in knowledge and dexterity, yet 
somehow failing to impress us with any cen- 
tral greatness. The last is a delicate handed 
chemist, who, from the full flasks of older 
masters, Courbet, the Japanese, Rembrandt, 
and Velasquez, distilled volatile and vaporous 
essences of his own which have magic in them.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



MR. EDWARD CARPENTER'S OPTIMISM, as re- 
vealed in his reply to the recent notable 
address presented to him on the occasion of his 
seventieth birthday, constitutes a cheering 
refutation of the scriptural assertion that the 
modicum of strength left to a man after he 
has reached the three-score-and-ten limit is 
but labor and sorrow. Thinker, social re- 
former, poet, author, beloved of our own Walt 
Whitman, Mr. Carpenter in no wise disap- 
points expectation in the ringing, courageous, 
high-hearted tone of this memorable utter- 
ance, in the course of which he says: "The 
enormous growth during the past few years of 
democratic and commfrmal thought and or- 
ganization on the Continent generally is well- 
known, and the events of which we are 
speaking have suddenly crystallized into that 
definite consciousness and into a fresh resolve 
for the future the resolve that never again 
shall the peoples be plunged in the senseless 
bloodshed of war to suit the ambitions or the 
private interests of ruling classes. ' ' Further : 
' ' The new order thus arriving will largely be 
the outcome of those- years of work all over 
Europe in which the ideal of a generous com- 
mon life has been preached and propagated 
as against the sordid and self-seeking com- 
mercialism of the era that is passing away." 
Significantly autobiographical are these fur- 
ther words from the "democratic author and 
poet," as he chooses to call himself: "If in 
my small way I have done anything towards 
the social evolution of which I speak, it is, I 
think, chiefly due to the fact that I was born 
in the midst of that commercial era, and that, 
consequently, my early days were days of 
considerable suffering. Coming to my first 
consciousness, as it were, of the world at the 
age of sixteen (at Brighton in 1860), I found 
myself and without knowing where I was 
in the middle of that strange period of human 
evolution, the Victorian age, which, in some 
respects, one now thinks, marked the lowest 
ebb of modern civilized society: a period in 
which not only commercialism in public life, 
but cant in religion, pure materialism in sci- 
ence, futility in social conventions, the worship

of stocks and shares, the starving of the 
human heart, the denial of the human body 
and its needs, the huddling concealment of 
the body in clothes, the 'impure hush' on 
matters of sex, class-division, contempt of 
manual labor, and the cruel barring of womien 
from every natural and useful expression of 
their lives, were carried to an extremity of 
folly difficult now for us to realize." Evi- 
dently there is little of the laudator temporis 
acti in this forward-looking and serenely hope- 
ful poet and prophet of democracy. 


THE LITERATURE OF LITTLE NATIONS need not 
itself be small in quantity or inferior in qual- 
ity, as has been proved by many instances, 
despite the loud assertions of the Bernhardi 
school that culture of all kinds flourishes best 
in States maintaining a vast military estab- 
lishment. Mr. James Bryce eloquently es- 
pouses the cause of the smaller nations in a 
late timely utterance that has gained pub- 
licity in the daily press. In the course of his 
remarks he says: "The small States whose 
absorption is now threatened have been a po- 
tent and useful perhaps the most potent 
and useful factor in the advance of civiliza- 
tion. It is in them and by them that most of 
what is most precious in religion, in philoso- 
phy, in literature, in science, and in art has 
been produced. . . . The Greeks were a small 
people, not united in one great State, but 
scattered over coasts and among hills in petty 
city communities, each with its own life. 
Slender in numbers, but eager, versatile, and 
intense, they gave us the richest, most varied, 
and most stimulating of all literatures. When 
poetry and art reappeared after the long 
night of the Dark Ages, their most splendid 
blossoms flowered in the small republics of 
Italy." Our debt to Switzerland, Holland, 
and the Scandinavian countries is pointed 
out, as also are the achievements of the little 
Germany of Goethe's time and the little En- 
gland of Shakespeare's. Already too great 
uniformity has been wrought by the great, 
dominant powers in a world that was for- 
merly so picturesquely varied in its thought 
and expression ; and any remotest prospect of 
one greedy and grasping nation's being able 
arbitrarily to impose its will on greater and 
greater stretches of territory until the whole 
globe or even any considerable portion of it 
shall be but a visible embodiment of that will, 
is too dreary and too abhorrent for contem- 
plation. 

* 

BOOKS AD LIBITUM, or unrestricted borrow- 
ing privileges, seems to be the goal toward 
which public library practice is now progres- 



ing, following hard upon the heels of that 
freedom of the shelves which has emphasized 
so unmistakably the difference between the 
timid and suspicious library administration of 
the old days and the fearless and liberal policy 
of the present. Some libraries, notably that at 
Trenton, New Jersey, lend books practically 
without limit in number to those asking for 
them in good faith and showing a disposition 
not to abuse their privileges. Others, as at 
Grand Rapids, Michigan, and Williamsport. 
Pennsylvania, are letting down the bars and 
relaxing former restrictions in a manner that 
speaks well for both the library management 
and the library users. In his seventh annual 
Report, Mr. 0. R. Howard Thomson of the 
last-named institution looks back with pardon- 
able complacency on things accomplished. 
''Mystically," he says, "seven is the symbol 
of perfection, and while no library can ever 
expect to attain to the beatitude of that myth- 
ical state, yet the past year having been the 
one that completed our first cycle of seven, it 
behooves us to look carefully over that which 
we have done." And a little later, touching 
on the subject here under consideration, he 
continues: "The opinion of many librarians 
that the restriction of borrowing privileges, to 
two books at one time, exerted an injurious 
influence on the character of the volumes 
drawn for home use, caused the Board to 
authorize a change in the rules. Hereafter 
card holders will be permitted to borrow four 
books, not more than two of which may be 
fiction, at any time on one card. . . . That this 
is a move in the right direction seems almost 
certain, for it makes for better service and in 
addition reduces clerical work." Whether 
emulation in respect to circulation operates 
with library officials in allowing this greater 
freedom, one cannot say; but it would be no 
crime if it were an impelling motive. 



POETRY AND PROSPERITY might be thought to 
be congenial companions; they go well to- 
gether on the tongue; but the indisputable 
fact remains that soul-stirring song has seldom 
been the product of luxurious living, and the 
great poets of the world have not often had 
their residence in Easy Street. "Poets by 
their sufferings grow," says the author of 
"Hudibras," and Shelley asserts that "most 
wretched men are cradled into poetry by 
wrong : they learn in suffering what they teach 
in song." Keats, Burns, Heine, Leopardi, 
and indeed one might add Dante, Milton, and 
Shakespeare, saw far more of the seamy than 
of the smooth side of life. One may question 
whether an unoppressed Poland would ever 
have given us a Chopin in music or a Sienkie-

wicz in romance, and whether an independent 
Hungary could have produced the lyrics of 
Petofi. What poet or composer or other crea- 
tive genius of the first rank has been given to 
the world by the imperial Germany that was 
started on its prosperous course by Bismarck 
and Moltke ? Mr. Walter Damrosch uttered a 
significant word the other day when he said: 
"I cannot see that Germany has produced 
any great master since the Franco-Prussian 
War. It is an interesting fact that the pros- 
perity which followed in Germany has not 
bred great genius. You might mention 
Brahms, but he came to his maturity before 
the war. Musicians are better paid in Ger- 
many than ever before, but they are not pro- 
ducing the music they once did. That brings 
up the old question of the effect of prosperity 
on art. I don't pretend to answer it, but I 
do say that it is largely to the French school 
that I am looking for interesting new music 
to-day. ' ' As with the children of Israel when 
brought into a land flowing with milk and 
honey, so with mankind in the present day, 
the tendency after one has waxed fat is to 
turn unto false gods. 



IMPRESSIONS OF THE LEIPZIG EXPOSITION, as 
set forth in attractive style by Mr. Theodore 
W. Koch, A. L. A. representative, make some- 
what melancholy reading now in view of the 
abrupt closing, for obvious reasons, of several 
important sections of that splendid interna- 
tional exhibition of the book-making arts. 
Mr. Koch saw the "Ausstellung" or the 
"Bugra, " a colloquial abbreviation for 
"Buch" and "Graphik," the two subjects of 
first importance in the exposition in its ear- 
lier days, its period of undimmed promise and 
hopefulness; and his official report on its 
main features and on the A. L. A. Exhibit 
which he installed in its assigned quarters, 
was published in the ' ' Library Journal, ' ' from 
which it is now reprinted in separate, illus- 
trated form. The interesting and instructive 
peculiarities of the Russian, Japanese, En- 
glish, and French contributions to the en- 
terprise each nation occupying its own 
characteristic building or pavilion were des- 
tined soon to be excluded from view, and the 
most that many of us will ever know about 
them is what may be gathered from such re- 
ports as Mr. Koch's. In bright contrast with 
the clouded closing of this memorable exposi- 
tion is his account of the "Salamander" with 
which the students opened their part of the 
show. The King of Saxony presided, there 
were large delegations from student societies 
or clubs all over Germany, gay with the corps 
colors, arid "Gaudeamus Igitur" was sung in 



true German style, making up in zest what 
was lacking in unison. Intelligent interest in 
the American library display is reported by 

Mr. Koch. 



AN ELOQUENT PROTEST against the unim- 
aginable horrors, the incredible anachronism, 
the shameful reproach, of the present war in 
Europe was uttered in verse worthy of the 
theme by Mrs. Caroline Fletcher Dole, mother 
of the Rev. Dr. Charles Fletcher Dole and Mr. 
Nathan Haskell Dole, a few weeks before her 
death. Both for its own sake and because it 
was written by one who retained her remark- 
able powers up to the verge of a century, we 
quote the poem's opening stanzas. 

" War ! In this year of our Lord ! 
Too late for the barbarous sword, 
And deadly missiles of dread, 
That lay thousands with the dead; 
While widows' and orphans' cries 
Ascend to the pitying skies. 

" War ! Fitting for fiends alone 
Where mercy is never shown! 
Was man for such fellowship born, 
And human life shall he scorn, 
While widows' and orphans' tears 
Flow on through the desolate years ? 

" countries ravaged with war, 
What is this misery for? 
Such misery, dire and dread, 
All fair prosperity fled ! 
While sorrow, and want, and need, 
For deepest compassion plead." 

One more of these peculiarly moving stanzas, 
so haunting and dirge-like in their melody, 
pleads for a place here. 

" See battlefields filled with slain, 
And hospitals full of pain! 
Lands left to thistle and thorn, 
And homes deserted, forlorn 
While terror, grief, and despair, 
Fill the sweet ambient air." 

We have quoted but half of the entire poem, 
all of which is well worthy of reproduction. 



DISGUISED FRIENDS OF LITERATURE AND ART 
are now energetically engaged, if one may 
believe the "Frankfurter Zeitung," in pre- 
paring the way (with the help of a score or 
two of army corps) for a better and greater 
literature and art than any that the world has 
yet beheld. After deploring the destruction 
of Rheims cathedral and other venerated 
monuments of architecture, and after pointing 
out the criminal folly of resistance to German 
arms on the part of cities containing such 
monuments, the above-named journal finds

thought that one of the blessed results of the 
present smashing operations of the German 
war machine will take the form of ''works for 
the joy and fame of the human race more 
splendid than the towering churches of the 
Middle Ages, which have been brought by the 
heirs of those who built them into needless 
peril. ' ' By the same process of reasoning, the 
Louvain library destroyed despite the 
Frankfurt assertion that ' ' by the rules of war 
of all civilized nations an unfortified city is 
safer than a fortress ' ' will be replaced by 
a better in the happy post-bellum days that 
are now nearing their dawn. Elzevirs and 
Aldines and Caxtons, illuminated missals and 
early manuscript copies of the classics, are to 
be accounted well lost in return for the more 
excellent products of pens only waiting for 
the battle-smoke to clear away before begin- 
ning those "works for the joy and fame of the 
human race" which could not have been 
brought to birth by any gentler accoucheur 
than the Krupp gun and the incendiary bomb. 


EUROPEAN APPRECIATION OF AMERICAN LIT- 
ERARY TASTE can no longer intoxicate us or 
turn our heads, though it has not ceased to be 
gratifying. In a recent utterance ascribed to 
one of England's foremost living poets occur 
the words, "America has become far more 
than England both the market and the assize 
of Anglo-Saxon verse"; and further, "The 
writer of modern verse must for the future 
look to America both for audience and for 
criticism." So says Mr. Stephen Phillips, if 
he is correctly reported. In these days, when 
the United States is recognized as holding an 
enviable position among the great powers as 
counsellor and mediator, arbiter in heated dis- 
putes and friend in cases of distress; when, 
too, we are sending exchange professors to the 
great universities of the Old World, exporting 
our literary wares as well as our factory prod- 
ucts, and taking pride in foreign recognition 
of our painters and sculptors, it is difficult to 
realize that Sydney Smith once had the appro- 
bation of his fellow-countrymen when he de- 
livered himself of that oft-quoted taunt: "In 
the four quarters of the globe, who reads an 
American book, or goes to an American play, 
or looks at an American picture or statue?" 

A CHECK TO LIBRARY ACTIVITY, as to COUnt- 

less other kinds of activity, including even the 
official forecast of our weather, is to be 
charged to the account of the present war in 
Europe. The monthly "Book Bulletin" of 
the Chicago Public Library prints the follow- 
ing, which will strike a responsive chord in 
many other libraries of our land: "During 



the summer large collections of the newest 
books in German, French, Russian, and Polish 
have been received, and these are being pre- 
pared for circulation as rapidly as possible. 
Order lists were also in preparation for sim- 
ilar purchases of Bohemian and Yiddish 
books, but the receipt of these will be seriously 
delayed, if not indefinitely postponed by the 
unsettled conditions in Europe. All importa- 
tions of books have practically stopped, for 
the present, and only a few of the European 
newspapers and periodicals are being re- 
ceived, and these only irregularly and after 
much delay. Among other things, this state 
of affairs will cause the postponement of the 
issue of a revised finding list of German 
books, which was in progress, but which can- 
not be finished until numerous additional vol- 
umes can be secured to fill gaps, to replace 
worn-out and obsolete works, and to bring the 
collection completely up to date. It will be 
necessary, also and mainly for the above- 
mentioned reason to defer the opening of 
the Music Room for at least one month from 
September first, the date originally fixed." 
Quicquid delirant reges, plectuntur Achivi. 


IN DEFENCE OF NIETZSCHE, to whom the ac- 
cusing finger is now so often pointed, an 
exculpatory word comes from the newly ar- 
rived Sorbonne exchange professor at Har- 
vard. M. Henri Lichtenberger (the Franco- 
German combination of names is significant) 
teaches German literature at the French 
school where he holds a chair, and is said to 
have carried the study of Nietzsche further 
than any other French scholar. Sententiously 
characterizing himself as ' ' extremement 1 'ami 
de 1 'esprit allemand, extremement 1 'ennemi de 
1'empire allemand," he asserts that "it is 
false to lay the blame on Nietzsche for the 
philosophy which has actuated the German 
military leaders in this war. In fact, it is a 
gross misinterpretation of his philosophy. 
He did indeed love power, but never the 
power of arms, the might of mere territorial 
dominion. He loved the power of the mind 
and of the soul. Nothing, I think, could have 
displeased him more than the late supremacy 
of the materialistic military party in Ger- 
many." Thus has it ever been, he believes, 
with all the great Germans of genius. So was 
it with Goethe. "The empire, das Reich, has 
ever been a concept superimposed upon the 
fundamentals of German genius." This 
stout apologist of intellectual Germany will 
the more readily command our attention by 
reason of his having two sons now about to 
enter active service against materialistic and 
military Germany.

BEST-SELLERS OF THE MOMENT indicate, in- 
evitably, what is preoccupying all minds. 
London booksellers and to a great extent 
their American fellow-tradesmen are reaping 
golden harvests from the large sales of such 
timely publications as Dr. Rappoport's 
"Brave Belgium," the sevenpenny selection 
of Emperor William's speeches, letters, and 
telegrams grouped under the title, "The War 
Lord," the two-shilling English version of the 
renowned Bernhardi's "Germany and the 
Next War," the equally inexpensive edition 
of Prince von Billow's "Imperial Germany," 
Mr. Wile's "Men Around the Kaiser," a new 
and supplemented edition of the late Emil 
Reich's "Germany's Swelled Head," and Sir 
Robert Baden-Powell's "Quick Training for 
War. ' ' There has even sprung up an ephem- 
eral crop of war periodicals, to which popular 
attention willingly turns, and war counters or 
tables loaded with martial literature in great 
variety are common in the bookshops. Widely 
indeed have we departed from the counsel of 
him who bade us ' ' read Homer once, and you 
can read no more; for all books else appear 
so mean, so poor, verse will seem prose; but 
still persist to read, and Homer will be all the 
books you need. ' ' 



THE LIBRARY'S INTEREST IN THE COMING^ 
GENERATION is a well-reasoned and legitimate 
interest; or, at least, so one may venture to 
believe, though not all libraries give such con- 
clusive evidence of this praiseworthy solici- 
tude as does the Grand Rapids Public Library, 
where, as its monthly "Bulletin" announces, 
a selected list of books on "Better Babies" is 
mailed to every young mother as soon as she 
has become a mother, and thus the circulation 
of works on the rearing of infants is greatly 
stimulated. Some of these books, we are told, 
are "almost as popular as the latest novel," 
and many copies have to be bought in order 
to supply the demand. Furthermore, "the 
Superintendent of Circulation has collected a 
series of photographs of babies whose mothers 
brought them up on library books." These 
are on exhibition, and it is affirmed that "a 
mere glance at these photographs will convince 
anyone that the mothers who use library books 
on this subject know how to raise better 
babies." The list itself is printed in the Sep- 
tember "Bulletin." 



A MISINTERPRETED POET has good reason to 
desire a correction of the misinterpretation, 
and if he himself be no longer living his 
friends will espouse his cause and demand 
that justice be done him. Certain compatriots 



of the German poet Hofmann von Fallersleben 
have felt some indignation at the false mean- 
ing so often attached to the refrain of his 
famous patriotic song written in 1841, long 
before any dream of world-conquest had dis- 
turbed the peaceful slumbers of his fellow- 
Teutons. Of course there was then not what 
could be called a united Germany, but Fal- 
lersleben conceived the notion of such a union 
some years before the upheavals of 1848 had 
made its advisability apparent to thousands of 
others ; and so it came about that he wrote his 
"Deutschland, Deutschland ueber Alles," in 
which the context shows clearly enough that 
he was not clamoring for a Germany supreme 
over all the world, but looking hopefully for- 
ward to a Germany extending over all the 
territory "from the Maas to the Memel, from 
the Etsch to the Belt. " Therefore, whether or 
not his verses have since been used to kindle 
zeal in a less worthy cause than that advocated 
by him, let us at least clear the poet of all 
blame in the matter. 



THE LITERARY NEEDS OF A BUSINESS MAN are 

outlined in no illiberal spirit by the catholic- 
minded editor of "The Newarker," who sets 
forth in large print on his first page the obli- 
gation resting on the man of commercial pur- 
suits to expand his mind by reading "several 
newspapers" for "thus he studies history 
while it is being made," and "thus he learns 
how business is going," and, lastly, "thus he 
learns his own town" two weekly periodi- 
cals that are named, "the best novels as they 
appear," "a good small book on something he 
is interested in, by a Man who Knows," the 
best journals of his own calling, and "every- 
thing else." It is plain that Mr. Dana 
would apply to business men the dictum of 
Pleydell in "Guy Mannering" on the subject 
of lawyers: "A lawyer without history or 
literature is a mechanic, a mere working 
mason; if he possesses some knowledge of 
these, he may venture to call himself an archi- 
tect." 



AN ALLEVIATION TO THE RIGORS OF CENSOR- 
SHIP which now so pitilessly deprive us of full 
and authoritative and prompt news from the 
battle front may be found in the announce- 
ment, by wireless from Berlin, that the Kaiser 
has commissioned Herr Rocholl, the German 
painter of battle scenes, to proceed to the 
firing line in western Europe and take meas- 
ures to preserve by his art, for all time, a 
graphic delineation of the struggles and tri- 
umphs of the military forces of the Father- 
land in their earnest endeavors to disseminate 
Teutonic culture throughout Europe.

ESSAYS ox THE NOVEL.* 



To his already considerable and distin- 
guished body of criticism, Mr. Henry James 
now adds another volume of essays written 
and published at various intervals during the 
last two decades. As the novel is the almost 
exclusive subject held up for consideration, 
this volume constitutes a more weighty state- 
ment than Mr. James has heretofore given us 
of his conception of his art. The interest 
attaching to these "notes" is, indeed, very 
largely due to the point of view of the author, 
though, needless to say, the subjects are 
sketched with fine insight, with generous 
though discriminating appreciation, with the 
charm and felicity to which readers of Mr. 
James have so long been accustomed. 

It seems inevitable that, incidental to his 
career as a novelist, Mr. James should have 
produced a considerable body of criticism: 
the art of the novel is with him so much an 
intellectual matter, so much a manifestation 
of the critical spirit. We have the habit of 
calling his novels, rather crudely, "psycho- 
logical ' ' ; one meaning appropriately attached 
to this word in this connection is that of the 
state of a creating mind intensely aware of 
itself, shedding over its every operation a 
white light of self -consciousness ; his novels, 
as we know, are thoroughly "studied." And 
nothing could find criticism more congenial 
than this combination of intellectual curiosity 
with reflection. Criticism, moreover, to minds 
of his type, is not a diversion, but an inevita- 
ble mental process, a necessary part of appre- 
ciation : 

" The effect, if not the prime office, of criticism 
is to make our absorption and our enjoyment of 
the things that feed the mind as aware of itself as 
possible, since that awareness quickens the mental 
demand, which thus in turn wanders further and 
further for pasture. This action on the part of 
the mind practically amounts to a reaching out for 
the reasons of its interest, as only by its so ascer- 
taining them can the interest grow more various. 
This is the very education of our imaginative life; 
and thanks to it the general question of how to 
refine, and of why certain things refine more and 
most, on that happy consciousness, becomes for us 
of the last importance." 

For such criticism, the more reflective nov- 
elist provides better material, a more definite 
"case," than he who works mainly through 
feeling and instinct. Mr. James, in reading 
the letters of Stevenson, notes in them "no 
instance of his expressing a subject, as one 

* NOTES ON NOVELISTS, with Some Other Notes. By Henry 
James. New York : Charles Scribner's Sons. 



may say, as a subject hinting at what nov- 
elists mainly know, one would imagine, as the 
determinant thing in it, the idea out of which 
it springs." His appreciation, however, is 
versatile enough to enjoy Stevenson, or even 
Mrs. Oliphant versatile enough even to be 
overcome by the talent of the author of 
"La dame aux Camelias": 

" I recollect coming out of the Gymnase one 
night when Madame Pierson had been the Mar- 
guerite this was very long since and giving 
myself up on the boulevard to a fine critical sense 
of what in such a composition was flimsy and 
what was false. Somehow, none the less, my fine 
critical sense never prevented my embracing the 
next opportunity to expose it to the same irrita- 
tion ; for I have been, I am happy to think to-day, 
a plaj'goer who, whatever else he may have had on 
his conscience, has never had the neglect of any 
chance to see this dramatist acted." 

But this case is among the rare exceptions. 
The essays devoted to Zola, Flaubert, Balzac, 
and George Sand, occasioned by various new 
publications throwing new light on their lives 
and works, are fascinating examples of the 
critical and the appreciative working in full 
and conscious harmony. 

These novelists, however, are not new mate- 
rial in the hands of Mr. James. His previous 
"renderings" of them to a degree take the 
edge off our curiosity regarding these later 
essays. But his chapter on ' ' The New Novel ' ' 
has the interest of a new subject, inasmuch as 
Mr. James has seldom gone out of his way to 
disagree with his English and American con- 
temporaries. This essay begins with a discus- 
sion of ' ' our contemporary flood ' ' and the ab- 
sence in England and America of sufficient 
critical activity to check it or improve its 
quality. At the forefront among the practi- 
tioners of the "new novel" he places Mr. 
Wells and Mr. Bennett, who are thus grouped 
together "for the simple reason that with the 
sharpest differences of character and range 
they yet come together under our so con- 
venient measure of value by saturation." 
Saturation, as readers of Mr. James will re- 
member, is the first part of his artistic creed : 
the novelist must observe, notebook in hand, 
the life he wishes to paint; he must observe 
so thoroughly that he first knows as life every- 
thing he puts into his novel; "to be saturated 
is to be documented." This state of satura- 
tion is the highest value he finds in these two 
novelists. What they lack is "the centre of 
interest," "the sense of the whole," the opera- 
tion of any selective or arranging principle. 
A "slice of life" is not an adequate formula 
for a work of art ; Mr. James opposes to it the 
conception of the ' ' extract, ' ' a chemical proc- 
ess, not a mechanical. His concern over these 



1914] 



THE DIAL, 



333 



novelists is thus confined to their treatment of 
their subjects. Mrs. Wharton, too, has clearly 
a saturation, but she is also, with Mr. Gals- 
worthy and Mr. Hewlett, a votary of selec- 
tion and intention, an embodiment "of some 
state over and above that simple state of 
possession of much evidence, that confused 
conception of what the 'slice of life' must con- 
sist of" characteristic of the work of Mr. 
Wells and Mr. Bennett. 

It will of course be noticed that these are 
not questions of aim but of method. Mr. 
James does not concern himself with the 
choice of subject made by an author : 

" His subject is what is given him given him 
by influences, by a process, with which we have 
nothing to do ; since what art, what revelation, can 
ever really make such a mystery, such a passage in 
the private life of the intellect, adequately trace- 
able for us? His treatment of it, on the other 
hand, is what he actively gives ; and it is with what 
he gives that we are critically concerned." 

Mr. James protests against the restriction 
placed upon the English and American nov- 
elist by the presence of the "young person" 
in his audience. The unfettered novelist can 
ask only one question of his material: Is it, 
or is it not, of the stuff of life? Whenever 
Mr. James deals with what would seem to be 
the question of the moral responsibility of the 
dispenser of fiction, as in his essays on the 
Italians, D'Annunzio and Matilde Serao, this 
question merely resolves itself into questions 
of truth and of taste, which to him are ques- 
tions of artistic method. He handles ethical 
problems with gloves, does not come into di- 
rect contact with them, avoids the danger of 
a disconcerting charge. Thus the eroticism of 
D'Annunzio is vulgar, that of Matilde Serao 
is serious where it should have been comic; 
given the proper tone, style, treatment, the 
odious effect would disappear. This point of 
view leads him to a more debatable conclu- 
sion in his essays on George Sand. As a nov- 
elist she is too sentimental and spontaneous 
to receive high rank from Mr. James ; but he 
finds in her ' ' a supreme case of the successful 
practice of life." This woman who so easily 
turned her own experiences with her lovers 
into "copy," who so easily recovered herself 
in the presence of every disagreeable sit- 
uation, even when she herself was mainly 
responsible for it, who made all her heart- 
breaking experiences contribute to her own 
development, this woman is a fine example of 
the efficacy of tone and style to save. She is 
a "sister to Goethe." The "last word" about 
her is "that there is nothing for grand final 
Tightness like a sufficiently general humanity 
when a particularly beautiful voice hap- 



pens to serve it," It is of course provincial 
to disagree with this conclusion, and yet one 
feels that it is not the last word. George 
Sand perhaps kept her personality a delight- 
ful spectacle, but she must have been partly 
blind to her own essential nature. Was she 
ever a reflective moralist? Was she a spec- 
tacle, only, even to herself ? 

Such questions, we know, go beyond Mr. 
James 's conception of criticism. As one reads 
this pleasant volume one feels that, though full 
of thought, it is not from the study; that, 
though charming in manner, it is not of the 
salon. It comes from the artist's studio, full 
of shop talk about methods and processes. 
Even his appreciation is that of a fellow- 
worker, always conscious of the problems of 
composition. But even though it is so thor- 
oughly "professional," the quality of mind 
of the critic, as of the novelist, measures the 
value and interest of the completed product. 
And whatever Mr. James writes is certain to 
show fine perception, exact and delicate ren- 
dering, and a most earnest curiosity regarding 
his art - Louis I. BREDVOLD. 



A HUMANIZED KAKT.* 



Mr. Houston Stewart Chamberlain achieved 
celebrity in his adopted land of Germany 
some fifteen years ago by his book entitled 
"The Foundations of the Nineteenth Cen- 
tury, ' ' which has more recently become known 
to American readers. This present work on 
Kant was first undertaken by him in the form 
of lectures to an intimate circle of acquaint- 
ances and, at the urgent request of these, was 
published some years later (1905). The au- 
thorized translation by Lord Redesdale, which 
has just appeared, has been revised by Mr. 
Chamberlain himself. 

We have the authority of Lord Redesdale 
for the statement that the author regards this 
as the most important of his works. Mr. 
Chamberlain, though by training a natural 
scientist, has from the outset been interested 
in the problem of cognition and has endeav- 
ored to work his way toward a complete 
Weltanschauung. Science, he realizes, has 
developed in violent opposition to philosophy, 
which has for the most part been inadequately 
based on experience. Where the scientists 
have taken the matter in hand themselves, 
they have yielded us but the poor stammer- 
ings of an Ostwald or a Haeckel. Mr. Cham- 
berlain believes that Kant is our only safe

guide. His object in this book is not to give 
us an exhaustive treatise on Kant's philoso- 
phy, indeed, not so much to explain the 
thoughts of the thinker as the way he arrived 
at those thoughts. Other books on Kant have 
been technical and have attacked the subject 
from an abstract point of view. Mr. Cham- 
berlain speaks as a layman to laymen. In a 
word, he would humanize Kant. Believing 
that we gain our clearest illumination from 
points of difference, he chooses the compara- 
tive method of approaching the problem. In 
successive chapters he discusses the methods 
used by Goethe, Leonardo da Vinci, Descartes, 
Giordano Bruno, and Plato in arriving at 
their philosophies of life. This sovereign dis- 
regard of chronology is amply justified in the 
elaboration of the author's scheme. Each of 
the chapters contains an excursus on some 
particular point at issue, such as the doctrine 
of metamorphosis in connection with Goethe, 
or the essence of life in the chapter on Plato. 
The final and longest chapter is then devoted 
to Kant's attitude toward the fundamental 
questions of science and religion. By all odds 
the most illuminating of the comparisons are 
those with Goethe and Plato. The relation of 
Goethe to Kant has, so Mr. Chamberlain 
thinks, been deliberately ignored by the for- 
mer's biographers, who have been in part re- 
sponsible for the perpetuation of the legend 
of the "unphilosophical" Goethe. It is true 
that in Kant thinking predominated abnor- 
mally over seeing, whereas the eye was the 
centre of Goethe's intellectual life. The lat- 
ter 's thinking aimed to be concrete and to be 
drawn exclusively from visibility. Where he 
did not follow this method rigorously, he 
failed, as in the "Metamorphosis of Plants" 
that uncritical jumble of idea and experience 
which brought down upon his head the just 
reproof of Schiller. On the other hand, his 
''Doctrine of Color" is pure perception and is 
based wholly on empirical observations; for 
Mr. Chamberlain is willing to assert in the 
teeth of the physicists the validity of Goethe's 
main thesis in that work, which, he complains, 
no man can now be induced to read. Kant, on 
the whole, was far more jealous of the rights 
of experience as against idea than Goethe. He 
never tired of repeating that outside expe- 
rience no evidence of the truth was to be 
found. He was indeed, our author thinks, the 
only strict philosopher of experience known 
to the history of human thought. Plato alone 
is worthy of being mentioned beside him. The 
surprising juxtaposition of these two names 
is justified by Mr. Chamberlain on many 
scores. Like Kant, Plato's prime care was for 
moral well-being. Neither philosopher delved 



into first causes nor sought for a final princi- 
ple. Both insisted upon the imperative neces- 
sity of seeing everything with the eye and of 
posing the question of cognition critically. 
What Plato knew, Kant proved. But Plato 
expressed his intuitions poetically and by 
means of parables, while Kant struggled clum- 
sily with the abstract jargon which he had 
been obliged to adopt from the language of 
the schools. Hence the apparent chasm of 
divergence between the two thinkers. Yet 
even Plato's much misunderstood doctrine of 
ideas is a figurative adumbration of Kant's 
proof of the necessary conditions of expe- 
rience. When Plato says that a dog is not a 
dog until the idea "dog" has stamped it as 
such, he is only stating concretely Kant's 
proposition that perceptions without concep- 
tions are blind. It is Kant's unrivalled 
achievement that he demonstrated from the 
nature of our minds the essential categories 
of all experience. This scientific analysis 
rather than the positing of a Ding-an-sich (or 
the official vindication of God, freedom, and 
immortality) has given him, in the opinion of 
our author, his unique position in the history 
of thought. Kant looked upon God, not as a 
beginning but as an end, not as primary cause 
but as aim. The existence of free-will follows 
as a natural inference from the established 
fact of our moral nature. No attempt has 
been made by Mr. Chamberlain to meet the 
modern argument that the evolution of morals 
has upset Kant's doctrine of a categorical 
imperative. 

The reader is never left in doubt for a 
moment as to Mr. Chamberlain's own attitude 
toward these and sundry other problems. 
Dualism is, in his opinion, no theory but a 
fact; all monism is simply false. Attempts 
to seek unity behind duality are therefore ut- 
terly vain. Our perverse inclinations toward 
monistic systems he ascribes to the cabalistic 
puerility of attaching special significance to 
the number One, as if it were not of the 
essence of unity to presuppose plurality 
component parts. The author's disparage- 
ment of Spinoza, whom he regards as the 
enemy of all living perception, is thus readily 
understood. Readers who are familiar with 
"The Foundations of the Nineteenth Cen- 
tury" will recognize other favorite opinions 
of Mr. Chamberlain, notably his disbelief in 
the hypothesis of biological evolution, which 
seems to him to be "an idea, not an expe- 
rience." He attacks trenchantly the current 
notions of progress with which childish minds 
have intoxicated themselves. Every so-called 
progress of civilization, he asserts, puts new 
weapons into the hands of those who would 



1914]

suppress the dignity of man. Almost every- 
thing in modern life tends to make us less able 
to see and to think. Civilization is daily 
threatening to fall back into barbarism, an 
ominous utterance in view of the events in 
Europe during the last three months. The 
author's point of view, it will be observed, is 
intellectual, aristocratic, and astringent. He 
is an individualist whose lack of democratic 
sympathies may be measured by his assertion 
that the whole philosophy of socialism can be 
compressed into the words : ' ' ote-toi de la que 
je m'y mette." As against all such external 
nostrums, Kant reinforces Christ's teaching 
of the Kingdom of Heaven within us by show- 
ing that man cannot be made happy without 
first being made moral and wise. 

The author is an independent, original 
thinker, and a persuasive writer. He has ac- 
complished the improbable by furnishing a 
popular, human approach to Kant in two 
stout, closely packed volumes. One cannot, 
for example, resist the eloquence of the con- 
cluding pages, where the Kantian standpoint 
is urged as the indispensable basis for all 
future culture. But besides driving home his 
main arguments, Mr. Chamberlain gives the 
reader abundant intellectual stimulus of the 
incidental sort. The occasional audacity of 
his opinions is matched by the plausibility of 
his presentation. His obiter dicta must in- 
deed be received with much reserve. It should 
not be forgotten that the central thesis of 
"The Foundations of the Nineteenth Cen- 
tury" has been strongly controverted by the 
ethnological experts, though the manifold sug- 
gestiveness of that work can hardly be gain- 
said. In such matters we laymen must simply 
take the word of the specialist and accept, at 
least tentatively, the orthodox view, no matter 
how brilliantly the heresy may be urged. 

Mr. Chamberlain is an accomplished Ger- 
man stylist. The translation is on the whole 
extraordinarily well done, though of necessity 
much of the savor of the original has been 
lost. However picturesque such a phrase as 
"carrying owls to Athens" may be, it inevita- 
bly suggests the foreign idiom, while a sen- 
tence like "Out of the chaos of chemistry 
Ostwald has known how to construct a per- 
spicuous erection" is downright barbarous. 
But such lapses are rare. Greater care should 
have been exercised in the proof-reading of 
the French and German titles, where many 
mistakes have crept in.

PUER, PATER HOMIXIS.* 

Reading Dr. Mangold's admirable textbook 
on ' Problems of Child Welfare," we keenly 
regret one thing, and that is the date of the 
work. What a pity it is that this text was not 
in existence, and courses based on it being 
given, years ago! The treatment of the 
various topics is not particularly original, it is 
even in places a little patchy and inconsistent, 
owing to the incorporation of data from mis- 
cellaneous sources; but the book covers a 
great field, and, in spite of being condensed, is 
readable and interesting. In his Preface, Dr 
Mangold notes that "The book is designed 
especially for use by college and university 
students in courses on constructive and pre- 
ventive philanthropy. However, the general 
reader has not been forgotten, and it is hoped 
that the book will appeal to that growing class 
of men and women who in a systematic way 
are endeavoring to acquaint themselves with 
the various aspects of practical sociology." 
To this modest estimate of the book's sphere 
of influence we would make some additions. 
What mother or father, for example, would 
not profit by the perusal of an up-to-date sum- 
mary of the sociology of childhood? There 
are many sources of information, of course, 
but practically these are mainly closed to 
busy and often isolated people, to whom a 
condensed abstract is a necessity. What bet- 
ter text could be found for the year's work of 
a woman's club? What about the numerous 
city officials, whose training has usually been 
entirely too narrow to enable them to deal 
intelligently with the problems before them? 
And finally, why should not the college course 
on child-welfare become one of the great 
standard courses, instead of a side issue for 
those supposed to be philanthropically in- 
clined ? 

There is no doubt that practical sociology, 
the science and art of living together, is rap- 
idly gaining favor, but it must not be left to 
haphazard progress. It is altogether too easy 
for the energy of great movements to flow into 
blind alleys, or to beat vainly against insuper- 
able obstacles. Dr. Mangold's work may well 
serve to point out the numerous and important 
avenues for advance and the difficulties in the 
way. It will especially tend to give the reader 
a broad outlook, so that he will not see in 
some single reform the sole promise of good. 
The universities ought to lead in all this en- 
deavor, but long experience suggests that they

need pressure from outside to stimulate their 
progressive activities. It would be a practical 
and beneficent plan to raise funds to endow 
chairs for the exposition of child-welfare 
problems ; but should this be done, it would be 
necessary to see that the appointees were peo- 
ple who believed in doing things, not merely 
talking about them, and that the college or- 
ganizations did not make it difficult for stu- 
dents to take the courses. 

It is not practicable to review the details of 
Dr. Mangold's book, but we must call atten- 
tion to the legitimate satisfaction and hope to 
be derived from the evidences of social gains. 
Perhaps the most striking case is that of the 
reduction of infant mortality in recent years. 
' ' The states for which continuous records for 
12 years are available indicate a decline in the 
infant death rate of nearly one-fourth, while 
the mortality under five has decreased even 
more rapidly." Some have feared that the 
saving of infants would merely preserve weak- 
lings, who would succumb a little later; but 
the statistics show a steady gain even in later 
years, thus a decline of 26 per cent from 10 to 
14 years. Those who have worked as reform- 
ers during the last two or three decades have 
often felt discouraged, while the mass of the 
population, not seeing anything extraordinary 
happen, have been inclined to ignore or de- 
spise the efforts of enthusiasts. We now have 
data to show how great the success has really 
been, and to point the moral that social re- 
form in its most beneficent phases does not 
necessarily appear dramatic or attract the at- 
tention of the careless. 

The volume on " Juvenile Courts and Proba- 
tion ' ' is really the report of a special committee 
appointed by the National Probation Associa- 
tion ; and while the text has been prepared by 
two members of that committee, it expresses 
the views of the others, the whole being highly 
representative of the juvenile court move- 
ment. The report takes up the laws governing 
the courts, the organization and procedure of 
the courts, the probation problem, and gives 
various outlines for reports and statistics, as 
well as forms of all kinds. It is thus a suffi- 
ciently complete guide for those initiating 
this type of work in new localities, and for the 
general public it will serve as an exposition of 
methods and aims. It is extremely interesting 
to follow the evolution of the work. Origi- 
nally, the courts considered only the crime 
itself, for which, upon conviction, a certain 
punishment was legal. The juvenile courts 
considered not only the crime, but the boy or 
girl, the problem being to reform and renovate 
the individual. It has become apparent, how- 
ever, that the child cannot be intelligently 



studied or helped without reference to his 
environment, and the family engages the at- 
tention of the court. The family is part of 
the social group, so the circle continually 
widens, until every reader of these lines finds 
himself in some measure called to account. As 
a philosophical or academic proposition, all 
this has been clear from the start, but the 
interesting thing is that the realization of it is 
more and more guiding the activities of those 
who have to deal with juvenile delinquency. 
There has been and is much objection in va- 
rious quarters to this wholesale answer to the 
question of Cain, and every advantage has 
been taken of such imperfections as existed in 
the armor of the reformers ; but after all, aside 
from questions of personalities or particular 
methods, the new outlook is absolutely wise 
and necessary. 

The great growth of the probation system 
has resulted from the enlarged point of view. 
At first, it was merely a question of obliging 
the delinquents to live up to the rulings of 
the court. By degrees the probation officers 
ceased to be merely policemen, and became 
virtually guardians of the young people. So 
we are given this definition : ' ' Probation is an 
intimate, personal relation which deals with 
all the factors of a child's life, particularly 
his home. Its chief function is to adjust the 
forces of the community to the child's life. 
Every social agency is called into play, the 
object being to surround the child with a net- 
work of favorable influences which will enable 
him to maintain normal habits of life. ' ' Con- 
sequently, the probation officer should be 
temperamentally suited to the work and ade- 
quately trained. The tendency is to keep 
more and more cases out of court altogether, 
dealing with them in the homes. At first 
sight, it seems almost grotesque that a few pro- 
bation officers should attempt to influence the 
ways of a great city; but there are other 
agencies with which they may cooperate, while 
the intelligent treatment of a few cases may 
indirectly affect a multitude. The report in- 
sists upon the value of statistics, but justly 
remarks that "it requires a long and careful 
study of any extensive group of statistics to 
interpret correctly their significance to the 
community. . . . Too often we find statistics 
complete in themselves, but almost valueless 
because they are not properly interpreted." 

The present reviewer, recently investigating 
the statistical results accumulated by the 
Juvenile Court at Denver, was astonished to 
find how misleading the most carefully gath- 
ered data may be, unless judged and inter- 
preted by those actually engaged in the work. 
Thus, the increasing skill of the probation offi-

cers tends to diminish the number of cases 
treated in the court, and therefore entered in 
the records, without any reference to a dimin- 
ution in the number of offences. The cases 
involving girls are mostly dealt with by a spe- 
cial officer, and do not appear in the records. 
The comparatively small number of cases in 
which the father is living, but the mother is 
dead, as compared with those in which the 
mother is living but the father is dead, is ex- 
plained by the fact that in the former case the 
children are generally sent to the orphan asy- 
lum. The practically negligible offences of 
Russian children are not wholly to be ex- 
plained by the good behavior of that race, be- 
cause many Russians are classed as Hebrews, 
and so appear in the statistics. However, the 
large number of offences by children of Amer- 
ican parents remains somewhat surprising, 
and suggests the inquiry whether after all the 
tendency to make trouble under conditions 
which offer little legitimate outlet for surplus 
activities is not to some extent an indication of 
qualities which under other circumstances 
would be socially valuable. Thus we come to 
the old question of nature and nurture, which 
must be ever in the mind of the juvenile 
court. We venture to suggest that the court 
officials and especially the probation officers 
would do well to make some study of the re- 
cent results of students of heredity, which 
would certainly illuminate every phase of 
their work. It would probably be easy, in 
many cities, to arrange for courses of lectures 
by members of university faculties who had 
given special attention to these matters. The 
greatest obstacle, at present, seems to be the 
high pressure under which the work is done, 
leaving neither time nor strength for anything 
outside of the routine duty of the day. 

"Children in Bondage" is a vigorous pro- 
test against the wrongs inflicted on children 
by commercial interests, and will appeal to 
many who have neither the industry nor the 
patience to go through works of the type just 
reviewed. The authors are not afraid to hit 
hard in a good cause, and we know that their 
blows are taking effect.

Mr. John Masefield's new volume of poems, 
" Philip the King," contains, in addition to the 
brief drama in verse which furnishes the title, a 
number of poems already familiar to magazine 
readers. Among these are " Biography," " Ships," 
and the war poem entitled "August, 1914." The 
volume is already published in England but no 
announcement of the American edition has yet 
been received. 



IMMIGRANTS, PAST AND PRESENT.* 



Many Americans have had their confidence 
in America's powers of assimilation rudely 
disturbed since the outbreak of the war in 
Europe by the unexpected appearance among 
us of thousands of persons of European birth 
or parentage whose sympathies appear to be 
wholly at odds with those of our own institu- 
tions and enormously in favor of military 
despots and despotism. Though Professor 
Ross's book, "The Old World in the New," 
was written and in part serially published be- 
fore the war stunned us, it will be to those 
chapters in which he discusses the adaptabil- 
ity to our institutions possessed by the various 
nations contributing to our population in re- 
cent years that the puzzled American will 
most eagerly turn. 

It seems doubtful whether his book could 
have obtained as good a hearing before the 
fact that we have so many among us whom 
we have failed to assimilate nationally was 
brought patently home. His Preface sets 
forth that incorrigible optimism of ours which 
will not see a threat to America but only a 
promise to the Old World in those who come 
unless the newcomer chances to have a 
complection different from ours, when we 
sometimes see more of a threat than exists. 
This is highly altruistic, but it is not in the 
least hard-headed or common-sensible. The 
conclusion of the war now waging, when it 
does come to an end, will see myriads of folk 
from the devastated regions knocking at our 
gates, as has happened in times past. 
Whether our altruism will stand the test and 
our optimism come triumphantly through 
such an invasion is rather beside the ques- 
tions raised in this thorough-going volume: 
the point is whether we are to hand down to 
our own children an impaired heritage or not. 
Professor Ross thinks we are doomed to, and 
he thought so before the contingency of war 
arose to add force to his warnings. 

The earlier portion of the book is devoted 
to a consideration of the original composition 
of the people of these States. He begins with 
the first settlement, that of Virginia. Here 
begins, too, that series of frank and out- 
spoken criticisms of immigrants and their an- 
cestors, which would effectually stifle any 
aspirations for an elective office the author 
might cherish. Here is his characterization of 
the elements that have gone to build up the 
Old Dominion:

[Nov. 1 



is a myth; for it is now generally admitted that 
the aristocracy of eighteenth-century Virginia 
sprang chiefly from ' members of the country gen- 
try, merchants and tradesmen and their sons and 
relatives, and occasionally a minister, a physician, 
a lawyer, or a captain in the merchant service/ 
fleeing political troubles at home or tempted by the 
fortunes to be made in tobacco. Less promising 
was the broad substratum that sustained the pros- 
perity of the colony. For fifty years indentured 
servants were coming in at the rate from a thou- 
sand to sixteen hundred a year. . . . The slums 
and alleys were raked for material to stock the 
plantations. Hard-hearted men sold dependent 
kinsfolk to serve in the colonies. Kidnappers 
smuggled over boys and girls gathered from the 
streets of London and Bristol. . . . American 
scholars are coming to accept the British estimate 
that about 50,000 convicts were marketed on this 
side the water." 

After a sufficient survey of the constituents 
of our colonial and pre-constitutional popula- 
tion, the Huguenots, Germans, and Scotch- 
Irish, Professor Boss passes to the great waves 
that have incorporated themselves in our body 
politic during the nineteenth and twentieth 
centuries: the Irish, driven here by British 
misgovernment and famine ; the Germans flee- 
ing from the tyranny of Hohenzollerns and 
other despots, and more recently driven by 
economic pressure; the Scandinavians, seek- 
ing betterment of home conditions; the Ital- 
ians, the Slavs, the Hebrews from eastern 
Europe; and thereafter the lesser groups, 
Finns, Magyars, Portuguese, Greeks, and 
Levantines. In each case the actual contribu- 
tion of such groups is carefully, impartially, 
and fearlessly considered; their powers of 
self-government and of absorption of Amer- 
ican ideals are weighed, and their contribu- 
tions for good and ill to criminality, delin- 
quency, pauperism, insanity, are viewed in 
the light of the available statistics. 

To set forth the topics discussed which 
should interest every lover of his country 
would be to rewrite the book, for there is no 
page of it negligible. A chapter is devoted to 
the "Economic Consequences of Immigra- 
tion," and it is not a narrative of sunshine 
and hope. Another deals with the "Social 
Effects of Immigration," and this ought to 
jar us out of national self-complacency, if we 
can be so jarred. That taking up the prob- 
lem of "Immigrants in Politics" does not 
touch the question of Americans as bribers 
and immigrants as the bribed, or that of the 
swamping of American radicalism by inher- 
ited European conservatism, but it does deal 
with the even more important problem pre- 
sented by thousands of voteless workers. 

The concluding chapter on "American 
Blood and Immigrant Blood" contains some 



messages of reassurance, but not enough to 
leave any thinking person comfortable about 
the future. It is more than a little alarming 
that the American people, as fecund as any 
on earth up to the very moment of the com- 
ing of the foreigner in 1830, should utterly 
fail to maintain their older birth-rate in his 
presence. This statement of it, as Francis 
Amasa Walker pointed out years ago, is to 
be taken with complete literalness : 

" Not only did the decline in the native element, 
as a whole, take place in singular correspondence 
with the excess of foreign arrivals, but it occurred 
chiefly in just those regions to which those new- 
comers most frequently resorted." 

Professor Ross does not elaborate; but it 
has been shown time and again that if a 
homogeneous American community, seeking 
the establishment of factories for the sake of 
"progress," takes into its midst a population 
of foreign operatives, the birth-rate of the 
community as a whole maintains itself, but 
only because it is kept up by the superior 
fecundity of the immigrant. 

It is in this last chapter that a broad dis- 
tinction is outlined, separating into groups, 
colonial and national, those who have been 
making the American people of the past and 
are going to make the Americans of the fu- 
ture. Those above the norm or average of 
the countries whence they came are called 
"super-representative," those below it "sub- 
representative," and the rest merely "repre- 
sentative": 

" Super-representative : English Pilgrims, Puri- 
tans, Quakers, Catholics, Scotch Covenanters, 
French Huguenots, German sectaries. 

"'Representative: English of Virginia, Mary- 
land, and the Carolinas, Scotch-Irish, Scotch High- 
landers, Dutch, and Swedes. 

"Sub-representative: English of early Georgia, 
transported English, eighteenth-century Germans. 

" In our national period the Germans of 1848 
stand out as a super-representative flow. The 
Irish stream has been representative, as was also 
the early German migration. The German inflow 
since 1870 has brought us very few of the elite of 
their people, and I have already given reasons for 
believing that the Scandinavian stream is not alto- 
gether representative. Our immigration from 
Great Britain has distinctly fallen off in grade 
since the chances in America came to be less attrac- 
tive than those in the British empire. However, 
no less an authority than Sir Richard Cartwright 
thinks that 'between 1866 and 1896 one-third at 
least of the whole male population of Canada be- 
tween the ages of twenty and forty found their 
way to the United States,' and this ' included an 
immense percentage of the most intelligent and 
adventurous.' 

" Europe [now] retains most of her brains, but 
sends multitudes of the common and the sub-

common. There is little sign of an intellectual 
element among the Magyars, Russians, South 
Slavs, Italians, Greeks, or Portuguese. This does 
not hold, however, for currents created by race 
discrimination or oppression. The Armenian, 
Syrian, Finnish, and Russo-Hebrew streams seem 
representative, and the first wave of Hebrews out 
of Russia in the eighties was superior. The 
Slovaks, German Poles, Lithuanians, Esthonians, 
and other restive subject groups probably send us 
a fair sample of their quality." 

A little earlier the later immigration has 
been stated to be unfit to maintain our 
American standards, however it may conform 
to those of the country whence it flows. ' ' The 
blood now being injected into the veins of 
our people is sub-common," Professor Ross 
observes. "To one accustomed to the aspect 
of the normal American population, the Cali- 
ban type shows up with a frequency that is 
startling." As a result he believes that our 
national types of beauty must suffer. He 
does not tell how much the newcomers have 
debased our English speech. 

The book offers no scheme of protection 
against the ills it proves are threatening us, 
and no panacea for those which heedlessness 
has already brought us. But it is a book 
which should be read. We Americans of the 
older stock have little first-hand knowledge of 
the facts it relates, and must be content to 
take them second-hand. In any event, the im- 
portant thing is to know them. We may 
either refuse or accept further immigration. 
But to continue stupidly to ignore the prob- 
lem of immigration is neither humanitarian 
nor patriotic. WALLACE RICE. 



GRADUATES OF YALE.* 



The Reverend Anson Phelps Stokes 's hobby 
of collecting autograph letters of eminent 
"Yalensians" has had a happy issue in two 
impressively printed and bound quarto vol- 
umes containing biographical sketches of 
seventy-nine Yale men, together with briefer 
notes on a number of others of subordinate 
importance. The names were selected from 
the latest (1910) edition of the quinquennial 
catalogue; those now living, and those who 
have died since the publication of the cata- 
logue, have been omitted from consideration. 
The arrangement is according to the field of 
activity in which each man was most noted. 

Foremost is that of religion, at least if one 
surveys the long stretch from the foundation 
of Yale College "for upholding & Propagating 
of the Christian Protestant Religion. ' ' Yale 's

contribution to the New England Theology, 
the establishment of the American Episcopal 
Church, her part in the missionary movement 
which began in 1806, and the training afforded 
by the Yale Divinity School are represented 
by biographical studies of such divines as 
Jonathan Edwards, Samuel Seabury, David 
Brainerd, and Nathaniel William Taylor. 
The second chapter, devoted to authors, is of 
course a meagre list in comparison with what 
Harvard could present. Mr. Stokes points out 
that his Alma Mater has been conspicuous for 
fortiter in re rather than for suaviter in modo, 
and proceeds candidly enough : 

"As far back as 1768, President Stiles referred 
to English composition as a thing in which 'we 
Yalensians do not pretend to excel,' and somewhat 
more than two generations later, the ' Lit.' had this 
criticism : ' In stout, manly intellect, in acute, 
analytic discrimination, in clear, sound judgment, 
in a pure, elevated taste, in energy and activity of 
mind, Yale has acknowledged no superior, and but 
one rival, in America. We are sorry we cannot 
say as much for purity, beauty, and classic ele- 
gance of style." 

The chief biographies that follow are those 
of John Trumbull, Joel Barlow, Fenimore 
Cooper, N. P. Willis, Donald G. Mitchell, and 
Edmund Clarence Stedman. 

The third division is that of "Educational 
Leaders. ' ' In this field Yale takes high rank. 
One hundred and fifty-seven of her graduates 
have been college presidents, and in educa- 
tional pioneering her achievement has been 
surpassed by only one university. The biog- 
raphies in this group include Jonathan Dick- 
inson, first President of Princeton College; 
Samuel Johnson, first President of King's 
(now Columbia) College; Eleazar Wheelock, 
founder and first President of Dartmouth Col- 
lege ; and Daniel Coit Oilman, first President 
of Johns Hopkins University. In the next, 
and closely related, division of scholars, there 
are few of first-rate importance. The lexicog- 
raphers Webster and Worcester are included 
here. 

Next are "Men of Science" Silliman, 
James Dwight Dana, Samuel William John- 
son, etc. Then come ' ' Inventors and Artists ' ' 
a somewhat odd combination despite the 
author's remark that the "faculty of the 
imagination is at the basis of both" in- 
cluding Eli Whitney and Samuel F. B. Morse. 
Of statesmen, Yale has had a large repre- 
sentation sixty-two United States senators, 
twenty members of the Cabinet, twenty-eight 
ambassadors and ministers, forty-seven gov- 
ernors of states. Mr. Stokes presents a di- 
verting list, beginning with Mr. Taft as presi- 
dent and Calhoun as vice-president, to prove 
that "it would be possible to make up an

almost complete federal government from 
Yale men who, at different times, have held 
the most important positions." The roll of 
fame is concluded by the " Lawyers and 
Jurists," and "Patriots and Soldiers." 

There are also supplementary chapters on 
"Historical Factors of Influence at Yale" 
(which are "study, religion, inspiring teach- 
ers, and association with men") ; "Common 
Characteristics of Most Eminent Yale Men" 
(the Yale ideal socially "expresses itself in 
democracy, spiritually in faith, intellectually 
in conservatism, and morally in constructive 
activity"); and "Historic Universities in a 
Democracy" (reprinted from "The Yale Re- 
view, ' ' July, 1913) . The appendices name the 
most distinguished Yale graduates according 
to the states of the Union in which they lived, 
and according to the Yale classes with which 
they graduated. There is a full index. 

Although the book will be of most value to 
Yale graduates to such, indeed, it will 
prove a useful and inspiring work it ought 
to command a more general interest as well. 
It is true that many of the "major biog- 
raphies" (such as those of Edwards and 
Cooper) seem rather purposeless, just because 
the men commemorated are eminent and have 
often been written about; and it is also true 
that the minor biographies often deal with 
men relatively obscure, and so do not always 
justify themselves. On the other hand, one 
should note that in all the biographies the 
college life of the men has been stressed par- 
ticularly, and that the biographies include 
letters, reference to portraits, busts, and win- 
dows in Yale buildings and to Yale lecture- 
ships and scholarships, and a few words 
regarding the chief writings by and on the 
men whose lives are sketched. Moreover, it is 
a great advantage to have all of the lives in 
one well-rounded work, which may be used for 
reference as well as for insight into Yale life 
in the past and the ideals of her graduates. It 
is worth mentioning here that "one-third of 
the biographies given in these volumes are of 
men who were ordained ministers, or regu- 
larly licensed to preach," and that of the 
forty-three men who were eligible for member- 
ship in Phi Beta Kappa, thirty-four, or sev- 
enty-nine per cent, were actually members. 

This is the kind of publication which is not 
likely to be undertaken, at least on so ambi- 
tious a scale, save by such an .institution as the 
Yale University Press. It is the kind of pub- 
lication which goes far toward justifying the 
existence of university presses.

RECENT FICTION.* 



An unusual personality offers tempting 
material to the novelist, and a tempting prob- 
lem, also. But the occasions on which a nov- 
elist has made really successful use of a 
great, or even a well-known, man as a hero 
are conspicuously few. What a multitude of 
bad novels have been written about a figure 
like Napoleon! George Meredith took excel- 
lent advantage of the opportunity offered by 
the case of Ferdinand Lassalle, but Mr. Mau- 
rice Hewlett wrote one of his least satisfac- 
tory novels about Byron. It would seem to 
be a rule that the experiment of taking an 
actual personage for a hero is dangerous, 
other things being equal, in proportion as the 
personage chosen is truly impressive in his 
historical character. The less familiar the 
original is to readers of novels the less likely 
they are to object to the imitation. 

Mrs. de Selincourt furnishes in "The 
Encounter" an excellent illustration of the 
difficulty which attaches to presenting a 
much-discussed personality in a novel. For 
her hero is no less a person than Friedrich 
Nietzsche. Perhaps no man so recently living 
is the subject of as sharp difference of opinion 
among educated persons as he. There are 
those who find in Nietzsche's writings the 
stimulus and the consolation which their 
grandfathers found in the Bible; there are 
those who regard his books as the very centre 
and cause of the most dangerous tendency in 
modern thought and conduct, and there are 
those who regard the interest in him as an 
inexplicable mystery. Naturally, no repre- 
sentation of him in a novel will please more 
than one section of this triply, and rather 
evenly, divided public. Mrs. de Selincourt 'si 
view of Nietzsche is ironic. The spectacle 
of so weak a man making such fierce and 
such large demands on life arouses in her the 
spirit of comedy which is so intimately con- 
nected with her skill as a novelist. The 
"encounter" of her title is that of Herr Weh- 
litz (Nietzsche) and an American girl, Persis 
Fennamy. At their first meeting, he has kept 
silent while his friend, young Von Liidinstein, 
discusses Anna Karenina with Persis. She 
speaks : 

" ' It is through passion that life and its suffer- 
ings and its evil is perpetuated. It is true that 
Tolstoi is the apostle of death. That is why he is 
so great. He sees the truth. As a thinker he has 
not been great enough to follow intuition to its 
logical consequences. He is a Buddhist who tries

to condone life. As an artist he has condemned 
it finally.' 

" While Liidinstein and the young girl thus de- 
bated their incongruous theme, Herr Wehlitz had 
sat listening, motionless, his eyes dilated. Now, 
suddenly, he sprang to his feet and leaned for- 
ward toward Persis, resting his finger-tips upon 
the table. ' You do not know what you say ! ' he 
exclaimed in a vibrating voice while a tremor of 
intense feeling almost convulsed his face. ' You 
are a child and do not know what you say! You 
have read Schopenhauer, nicht wdhr? I ask you. 
You have read Schopenhauer?' He rapped vio- 
lently with his finger-tips upon the table. 

" Persis bowed assent. She maintained her 
calm. 

" ' I thought so. You have read Schopenhauer 
and believe that he has said the last word. No; 
listen to me ' ; he held up his hand as she 
sought to interpose a qualification. ' You are in- 
fected. It is enough ; listen to me now. It is I 
who have the last word to speak, a word that 
upbuilds more than it destroys. Schopenhauer 
saw that life is suffering and want and striving. 
It is true. I grant it. I flinch from nothing of 
his truth. But what I have to say is that life is 
not valueless on that account. Cowards find it so, 
and rot to the nothingness where they belong. 
You are not one of them. You cannot look me in 
the eyes and say that you are one of them. No. 
Yours is not the weakness that turns shuddering 
away from life. Yours is the youth and pride 
and strength that measures itself against life 
and scorns its puerilities. Tolstoi would lead the 
world into a nest of maggots where the weak 
cling together and find sustainment in loathsome 
unity.' . . ." 

The speech of Herr Wehlitz is representative 
enough of a view which Nietzsche expressed 
in many ways. But it does seem to be taking 
a mean advantage to give to Nietzsche in 
English the awkwardness of German idiom. 
It takes from his dignity and it does not sug- 
gest that in the use of his own language he 
was an artist. Nevertheless, Herr Wehlitz 
captures the imagination of Persis, and Mrs. 
de Selincourt's comedy is begun. It is only 
fair to add that she conducts it with all the 
delicately effective art, especially those parts 
of it which grow from the relation of Persis 
and her mother, of which she has become the 
exponent. 

The anonymous author of "The House of 
Deceit" expressly denies that his hero is a 
real person, saying in a foreword : "I think it 
is well for me to state that the chief person of 
this story is neither founded upon nor aimed 
to represent, however indirectly, any politi- 
cian in real life. " It is the fate of this state- 
ment to start the suspicion it would prevent, 
especially when we remember that this is an 
English novel and that the English law of libel 



is peculiarly strict and severe in such cases. 
But the suspicion attaches itself to no familiar 
public character, so far as we are concerned, 
and the portrait which it is the book's pur- 
pose, to present has not the defects of a 
photograph. Indeed, it is a workmanlike por- 
trait, which bears every evidence of having 
been done by an old hand; and though the 
tale has a moral to it, the meaning is inherent 
and not ancillary. Maurice Sangster came up 
to London as an ambitious young man, a non- 
conformist, a teetotaller, and an egotist. One 
of his early adventures was with a newspaper 
editor who liked his articles so much that he 
was willing to explain how they could be 
made better. Maurice was too much pleased 
with the praise he received to reflect deeply 
on the meaning of the dispraise and, besides, 
he was ambitious. He followed the news- 
paper editor's advice about insisting less on 
the non-conformist, teetotalling part of him- 
self without much trouble. It was the kind 
of thing he continued to do throughout his 
career, this dropping a principle whenever it 
proved inconvenient, until he became home 
secretary and realized that his life was a hol- 
low sham. Whoever the author may be, he 
knows the situation into which he has put 
Maurice Sangster, and he describes it in an 
admirable, though not at all a precious, style. 
It is altogether improbable that any person 
generally known suggested ' ' The Rise of Jen- 
nie Gushing" to Mrs. Watts, but it is almost 
equally improbable that she wrote without a 
model in mind. For though the superficial 
outlines of her story, as of any story which 
turns on the love of a wealthy young portrait 
painter and a woman whom he has known as 
a servant and model, are conventional, the 
material of it is mostly human and true. We 
have felt that Mrs. Watts 's previous novels 
occasionally betrayed that sentimental view 
of life which is as alien to artistic truth as it 
is to scientific truth. But in this newest book 
we feel only that Jennie is a little too splen- 
did a creature, a little too richly endowed 
with strengths, and charms, and capacities. 
With this exception her story is genuinely to 
be enjoyed. Jennie began life in a slum, and 
spent some years in a reform school as a re- 
sult of that accident. But it was not wholly 
a misfortune, in Mrs. Watts 's view : 

" Not for nothing had Jennie Gushing spent 
those first twelve or thirteen years of her life in 
a slum. The memory of them underlay all subse- 
quent experience indestructibly and unalterably 
like the foundation rock of certain geological 
formations; and, however the processes of reform 
worked upon Jennie otherwise, they could have 
made no impression upon that lowest stratum of 



342

practical wisdom and first-hand observation of 
life." 

In the most direct, intelligent, and cour- 
ageous way, Jennie set about satisfying her 
own demands on herself. When her steady 
determination weakened at all, it was when 
love moved her more strongly than any of 
her calculations had allowed for. But when 
the time came, she left young Donelson Meigs 
unhesitatingly and she refused as firmly to go 
back to him under any condition. There is 
something stirring in Jennie's fortitude, even 
when we do not wholly believe in it. And 
there is a great deal to be said for the kind 
of novel Mrs. Watts writes, a novel replete 
with carefully observed facts, a record given 
meaning by both the historical and the socio- 
logical sense. The type as literature has some 
of the defects of its qualities as a document. 
But it is a sturdy, honest, and necessary type.

NOTES ON NEW NOVELS. 



In "The Auction Block" (Harper), Mr. Rex 
Beach has abandoned Alaska for Broadway. His 
heroine, Lorelei Knight, was beautiful. Her 
mother decided that the only way to capitalize her 
charms was to move from the small town which 
had been the family home to New York. The 
result justified the mother's shreVdness, if not her 
concern for her daughter's welfare. Lorelei imme- 
diately found a place in a " revue " and in two 
years she was so successful a beauty that her in- 
come made the family comfortable. Most, if not 
all, the types and situations expected in a story of 
the sort are introduced. Lorelei's acquaintances 
include the only son of one of the chief figures in 
the steel syndicate, a chorus girl who is a victim 
of cocaine, "gunmen," financiers, gamblers, and 
women of the demi-monde. In the end she man- 
aged to escape the life into which she thus entered 
and, never having been thoroughly contaminated 
by it, to attain happiness. 

Mr. Cyrus Townsend Brady has told again the 
story of a small boy who redeemed a mining camp 
populated by unregenerate sons of men. The hero 
of " The Little Angel of Canyon Creek " (Revell) 
had, however, the assistance of two adults; this 
couple came to Canyon Creek to establish a restau- 
rant and remained to start a Sunday-school. We 
leave the community safely singing hymns. 

The new volume of stories from the store which 
Miss Edna Ferber possesses is entitled " Person- 
ality Plus" (Stokes). Technically the hero of 
them is a young American named Jock, but in 
reality Emma McChesney, " secretary to the T. A. 
Buck Featherloom Petticoat Company," is again 
the principal figure. Those who receive slight 
intellectual thrills from Miss Ferber's humorous 
observation of American life and those who enjoy 
reading it as they would enjoy talking over old 



times with a friend whose turn for epithet and 
comment pleased them, admire these stories. 

It must have delighted Mr. Jack London to 
gather, even if it was only in imagination, such a 
crew as took part in " The Mutiny of the Elsi- 
nore" (Macmillan). More than one member re- 
minds the reader of the titular hero of " The Sea 
Wolf." The first mate, a veritable gorilla, owns a 
phonograph and finds in it his one gentle amuse- 
ment. Another character, a malevolent cripple, 
reads Renan, Carlyle, and Zola for relaxation. 
There is a love story, but Mr. London's real object 
is to revel in sailing a ship round the Horn with 
a crew of devils; and in that he admirably suc- 
ceeds. 

The story that Mr. Earl Derr Biggers has told 
in "Love Insurance" (Bobbs-Merrill) is ingenious 
to the last degree. It involves a beautiful, viva- 
cious, and wealthy young woman, the son of the 
astounding Earl of Raybrook (who played polo at 
the age of eighty -two), an American advertising 
expert, the wonderful diamond necklace known as 
" Chain Lightning's Collar," and an arrangement 
with Lloyd's by which the young lord was insured 
to the extent of 75,000 against the possibility that 
the young lady would change her mind before she 
married him. 

Last year Miss Margaret Peterson won the Mel- 
rose prize novel competition with " The Lure of 
the Little Drum." This year she presents " Blind 
Eyes" (Browne & Howell Co.), an even better 
book. It is the story of a young and naive girl 
who rebels at the prospect, suddenly revealed, of 
marriage and goes up to London to make a place 
for herself. There she observes the downfall of a 
friend and learns what love is. Miss Peterson is 
still finding her way as a novelist, but she has 
interesting things to tell and she seems anxious to 
tell them as well as she can. 

Mr. Ridgwell Cullum writes of the gold fields of 
the Yukon and the wheat fields of Canada. The 
hero of " The Way of the Strong" (Jacobs) grew 
up in the first region and became a man of wealth 
and power in the second. His story, full of primi- 
tive passions, is interwoven with that of Monica 
Manson, who was the victim of her own unselfish- 
ness. At her death, Monica's sister charged her 
with the care of an illegitimate son, urging her to 
acknowledge him as her own by an early marriage 
with a man since lost at sea. Monica's marriage 
was complicated by the necessity of concealing the 
boy, as well as by the desire for revenge of an 
enemy of his father's. But the end of the thrilling 
situation which Mr. Cullum has worked up is a 
happy one. 

"Sylvia" (Winston) is the second volume of 
the trilogy which Mr. Upton Sinclair began with 
" Sylvia's Marriage." It is a tract on the order of 
M. Brieux's " Damaged Goods." Sylvia's child is 
a victim of her husband's profligacy. She tries 
for a year to live with him in spite of the facts 
and then returns to the southern town from which 
she came to inaugurate a local campaign in favor 
of eugenics. Mr. Sinclair has made some attempts 
to lighten a story as factual as a vice report but 
without much success.

Professor ' ' When 7 use a word, ' Humpty 

SfSSSf' Dumpty said in rather a scorn- 
Germany. f u i tone, 'it means just what I 

choose it to mean neither more nor less. ' ' ' 
This citation from a well-known authority 
might have been used as a motto on the title- 
page of Professor Hugo Miinsterberg's "The 
War and America" (Appleton) to prepare 
the reader for revising the meaning of custom- 
ary words after reading the work provided 
he lend it credit. It appears to have been 
written by a superman for supermen, with a 
view to proving that Germany is under no need 
to observe ordinary morality. Its author has 
undertaken in the past to point out to Germany 
the sentiments of America, and to America the 
sentiments of Germany, apparently without 
having learned that neither nation is patient 
with sophistry. His method is simple. It con- 
sists in ignoring everything characteristic of 
German militarism, ignoring Von Treitschke, 
General von Bernhardi, and the others who 
have stimulated the world-ambition of the Ger- 
man governing class, ignoring the standing 
toasts through many years of the German naval 
and army officers of "To the Day!" and "To 
the Greater Germany overseas ! " or dismissing 
the apprehensions they have raised as "silly." 
It discloses the almost incomprehensible dis- 
tance between the German military mind and 
the American intelligence, one which forces 
the conclusion that the German cause must be 
worse than any of us have supposed it to be, 
when such arguments can be put forth in its 
defence. Professor Miinsterberg's qualifica- 
tion of the violation of Belgian neutrality 
leaves one gasping. "Belgium knew exactly 
that these neutrality treaties were not treaties 
comparable to the contracts of private per- 
sons who are bound by the laws of the land 
and by the laws of honesty to fulfil them 
under every possible condition. It is nothing 
but sheer hypocrisy if the enemies of Ger- 
many, including the Anglophile portion of the 
American press, behave as if this had not been 
common knowledge the world over." This is 
the major ethical premise of the argument, 
buttressed by the over-true interrogatory : 
"Did not America break its solemn treaty 
with Colombia when a vital interest was 
involved? Is not the majority of Congress 
even inclined to apologize for the wrong 
which was done to Colombia in the Panama 
revolution ? " It certainly is, wherein it differs 
from Professor Miinsterberg in the case of 
Belgium. The minor premise appears to 
be contained in this : "On the day the war 
between France and Germany seemed un- 
avoidable, it was reported that fifty automo- 



biles full of French officers rushed over the 
frontier to Liege and were welcomed in the 
fortress, which had been partly built by 
French engineers. . . . Everything suggested 
that Germany's long-standing fear was justi- 
fied, that French-speaking Belgium was in 
a secret understanding with France." The 
amiable conclusion is: "Germany could do 
what it did with a clean conscience; it did 
not violate the higher laws of honor." The 
Chancellor of the German Empire did not 
know that Professor Miinsterberg felt that 
way about it, or he might not have an- 
nounced to the Reichstag on August 4, "Our 
troops have . . . perhaps already penetrated 
into Belgium. This is against the law 
of nations. . . . We have been compelled to 
ignore the just protests of the governments of 
Luxemburg and Belgium. The injustice we 
commit we will repair as soon as our military 
object has been attained." This, at least, 
sounds like a man talking, a man self-con- 
demned as unjust and a law-breaker, but still a 
man. Americans may be pardoned if they pre- 
fer to take Baron von Bethmann-Hollweg's 
view of it, rather than Humpty Dumpty 's. 



Kit carson and Mr - Edwin L. Sabm, who has 
the frontier long been interested in the old 
frontier, has added a valuable 
volume to its annals in "Kit Carson Days, 
1809-1868" (McClurg), a fully documented 
and authenticated biography of the famous 
old Indian fighter and Civil War soldier, 
and a history of his times and compan- 
ions, illustrated by many rare prints. Carson 
was born in Missouri in 1809, of Pennsyl- 
vania Scotch-Irish stock strained through 
Kentucky, where the family made an alliance 
with the kinsfolk of Daniel Boone. Bound 
out to learn the saddlers' trade, at sixteen 
young Christopher ran away to follow the 
Santa Fe trail, and from that time until his 
death at Fort Lyon, New Mexico, in 1868, his 
history is that of the Southwest ; in his biog- 
rapher 's words: "the story of beaver and of 
Indians; of mountain, caiion, valley, desert, 
and stream ransacked through and through 
by the fur hunter; of white blood and red 
blood meeting, striving, and mingling 
mingling sometimes in friendly union but far 
oftener in the struggle of mutual hate." He 
early gained a reputation among both white 
men and red for an honesty so inflexible that 
it was never doubted ; this led, after years of 
fur hunting and all the chances of a path- 
finder in savage country, to his appointment 
as Indian agent among the Utes, "the most 
difficult Indians to manage within the terri- 
tory. " But this was not until after he had

proved himself as fearless as he was honest 
and had borne no small share in the Kearny 
and, later, in the Fremont expeditions during 
the Mexican war, and had taken part in more 
than one battle with the redskins. At the 
outbreak of the war between the States he 
became colonel of the First New Mexican 
volunteers, which he helped to raise, and took 
part in the battle of Valverde, assuming com- 
mand at Fort Craig afterward. His most 
celebrated Indian fight was at Adobe Walls 
in 1864. He was colonel and brevet brigadier 
general, and was retained in the service at 
the close of the war, filling a useful part in 
the negotiations which brought peace to the 
whites and Indians as well. The plainest of 
men, illiterate through most of his life, he 
was as efficient as he was modest. "So this 
is the great Kit Carson, who has made so 
many Indians run!" exclaimed a hero-wor- 
shipper to him one day. "Yes," drawled Car- 
son; "sometimes I run after them but most 
times they war runnin' after me." His 
mounted figure, done by St. Gaudens, crowns 
the pioneer monument in Denver, but his best 
memorial is in the words of Colonel Meline, 
written shortly before his death : " I find that 
he is beloved and respected by all who know 
him, and his word is looked upon as truth 
itself." Mr. Sabin has chosen an excellent 
subject, and treated it admirably. 



The economic The writing o f a detailed history 
progress of Russian economic develop- 

ment by a professor in an Amer- 
ican university would appear a bold under- 
taking one of those hazardous enterprises 
which can be justified only by being carried to 
completion with a conspicuous measure of 
success. It is pleasurable to record that, 
judged in accordance with all reasonable 
tests, Professor James Mavor's "Economic 
History of Russia" (Button) is a work which 
vindicates the author's enthusiasm for his 
unusually difficult subject and his determina- 
tion to put the results of his researches into 
print. The chapters making up the two large 
volumes follow an order which is roughly 
chronological and cover the entire period from 
the beginning of Russian history to the close 
of the revolutionary movement of 1903-7. 
A score of pages suffice, however, to record 
what there is to be said upon developments 
prior to the thirteenth century; and of the 
two volumes, the second is devoted entirely to 
the period since the accession of Alexander I. 
The value of Professor Mavor's book to En- 
glish and American students will arise princi- 
pally from the fact that it is based upon the 
work of Russian and other continental schol- 



ars who, in the past ten or fifteen years, have 
brought to light a multitude of new materials 
upon all phases of Slavic history and economic 
progress. In his earlier chapters the author 
makes large use of the writings of Professor 
Kluchevsky, and despite the fact that this 
authority's notable "History of Russia" has 
now been made available for English readers, 
there is much additional matter of value in 
those chapters by Professor Mavor which 
most nearly reproduce the chapters of Klu- 
chevsky. The treatment given the more re- 
cent aspects of the subjects of agriculture and 
capitalism and industry, the social democratic 
movement, the actual condition of the peas- 
antry on the eve of the war with Japan, and 
the revolutionary movement beginning in the 
south Russian strike of 1903 is not likely soon 
to be surpassed in a work in English. It is 
the author's conclusion that, notwithstanding 
the reaction by which the late revolution was 
followed, the economic and political history of 
the country has entered upon a new phase; 
that "the Duma, with all its defects, has be- 
come a school in which a new generation of 
competent rulers may be trained"; and that 
the nation has changed abruptly from one in 
which constructive, as well as destructive, 
criticism was sternly suppressed to one in 
which criticism of every sort abounds and is 
comparatively free. 



Several tricks of the trade are 
revealed by Mr. Arnold Ben- 
nett in a series of interesting 
articles on the profession of writing, pub- 
lished under the title of "The Author's 
Craft" (Doran). First of all, in order to see 
and record life properly, he outlines a game 
of observation as highly stimulating (and as 
exhausting) as his game, already familiar to 
many, of living on twenty-four hours a day. 
' ' Had one eyes, ' ' he suggests, ' ' the tying of a 
bootlace is the reflection of a soul." Few dis- 
cover it. The role of observer is too often 
passive instead of active ; the habit of looking 
without seeing is persistent. In the chapter 
dealing with play-writing, there is nothing 
startling or new in his assertion that the 
process of writing a novel differs from the 
process of writing plus producing a play; 
incidentally, though, it furnishes him an op- 
portunity to disclose methods of collaboration 
which are a part of the history of every suc- 
cessful play. He finds that it is easier to 
write a play than a novel, a sonnet than an 
epic. Such comparisons seem futile. And is 
it not a platitude this insisting that ' ' other 
things being equal, a short work of art pre- 
sents fewer difficulties than a longer one"? 



1914] 



THE DIAL

Other things being equal but they seldom 
are! In "Writing Novels" the equipment of 
the novelist is made to consist of a sense of 
beauty, passionate intensity of vision, and 
fineness of mind; some of the fundamental 
rules of technique are presented ; as a whole, 
the chapter contains a wealth of illuminating 
comment of value to the amateur novelist. 
The last of the four papers should have been 
entitled "Writer and Public" or "How the 
Writer Becomes Popular" and not "Artist 
and Public." In his finest moments of crea- 
tive inspiration, no artist is making a bid for 
popularity. All second-rate writers do, and 
their demand for it is immediate. Mr. Ben- 
nett defines a "pot-boiler" as the sort of work 
"done against the grain because the public 
appreciates it." Quite justly he suggests that 
a man who produces literary wares for the 
express purpose of selling them should have 
an aptitude for merchantry. But why make 
the same unqualified demand of the artist? 
Is it dilettante to hope that a man may be a 
true artist though he fails to see the connec- 
tion between art and money ? If so, then what 
taboo shall be placed on an occasional member 
of the opposite type the prosperous man of 
affairs who may happen to aver, honestly 
and unabashed, that his is not the talent to see 
the connection between money and art? To 
attempt to fit the two types into one mould, 
would be delightfully absurd. 



America, stained through many 
city-buiidi^g 0f 7 ears with the travail of bring- 
ing a continent to terms, is be- 
ginning to wipe away some of the evidences 
of her arduous labors and to deck herself in 
more becoming attire than she has heretofore 
had time for. Her people begin to recognize 
in architecture something more than the old 
farmer saw, who always thanked God when it 
rained that houses are built hollow. From 
architecture they are even going to the con- 
sideration of the surroundings in which edi- 
fices public and private must be placed and 
arriving at a community sense of beauty a 
vast step beyond mere individual interest, 
however enlightened. To this end Mr. Frank 
Koester, consulting civic engineer, has pre- 
pared a large and beautiful volume, "Modern 
City Planning and Maintenance" (McBride), 
in which are embodied the principles of the 
new art which is his profession, abundantly 
illustrated with reproduced photographs 
from European and American cities to show 
results already attained. The art of building 
beautiful cities, in spite of such exceptional 
cases as those of L 'Enfant in Washington 
and Haussmann in Paris, appears to have 



been lost, though perfectly understood in 
both ancient and mediseval times, until its re- 
vival in Germany in the seventies. There are 
to be found the largest number of instances 
of the deliberate intention of municipalities 
to make themselves attractive, both to those 
inhabiting them and to visitors; in this con- 
nection such a question as this is fairly 
startling to an American : ' ' Who ever goes 
to Jersey City, a larger city than Diisseldorf ; 
to Nashville, greater than Athens ; to Detroit, 
with a larger population than Rome; to St. 
Louis, almost the equal of Budapest; to Chi- 
cago, greater than Vienna or Berlin ; to Balti- 
more or Pittsburg, superior to Dresden; to 
Minneapolis, larger than Antwerp, or to any 
of a score of American cities, to see any sights 
worth seeing?" It is pointed out that this is 
a prime reason why Americans have no 
marked desire to "see America first"; upon 
the whole there is nothing but natural scen- 
ery worth seeing. But a hundred cities in 
the United States have been awakened al- 
ready, and a better future awaits them all. 
To an end so desirable such a book as this 
should contribute greatly, for it contains 
everything that can aid so excellent a cause, 
by precept in its text, by example in its 
illustrations.

Mr. E. V. Lucas, happened to make himself 
responsible for so quaintly charming a volume 
as this in contents, a periodical, with old- 
fashioned covers of sombre cloth. Several 
prominent living English writers are among 
the contributors. Mr. Galsworthy writes of 
"Fairyland," describing creatures who have 
"such magical loveliness as makes the hearts 
of mortals ache"; Mr. Hugh Walpole fur- 
nishes a "human interest" story; Messrs. 
Dobson, Hewlett, and Bramah, as well as Sir 
James Barrie and "Saki," are represented; 
the editor makes a sympathetic contribution 
of a slender page. Chapters from the novel 
"Spoof" are from the pen of Mr. Stephen

riences would really have been his, had he 
lived in the earlier decades to which some 
compositor's hurry had assigned him. Mr. 
John Drinkwater, on the other hand, inter- 
ested in a gray old scavenger, scorns the 
world's progress: 

" You and this and that man, 
All of you are making things that none of you 

would lack, 
And so your eyes grow dusty, and so your limbs 

grow rusty 
But mad Tom Tatterman puts nothing in his sack." 

There are hitherto unpublished letters of 
Stevenson, Buskin, and Browning, Browning's 
"A Castigation" being, in the words of the 
editor, one of the finest examples we have in 
the literature of remonstrance and chastise- 
ment. Besides, there still remain another 
half-dozen contributors, whose names have not 
even been mentioned. (Macmillan.) 



Stories of 
redeemed 
criminals. 



The story of a Jean Valjean, 
simply and straightforwardly 
told, is one of the most likely 
sorts of stories to command the listener's at- 
tention. Mr. Peter Clark MacFarlane has 
collected the biographies of eight "crooked" 
characters less known to the great world than 
Victor Hugo 's famous convict, but each and all 
of a marked individuality and, like Jean Val- 
jean, appealing by their still unspoiled man- 
hood to the humanity of the reader. "Those 
Who Have Come Back" (Little, Brown & 
Co.) concerns itself, as the title indicates, 
with those who, after going astray, have re- 
gained the straight path; and in most in- 
stances they have shown themselves eager to 
help other wrong-doers to reform. A forger, 
a burglar, a counterfeiter, a drunkard, and 
other less easily classifiable victims of com- 
bined heredity and circumstances, are pre- 
sented in life-like guise, and are either made 
to relate their own memorable experiences or 
have the narrative put into the third person 
by the sympathetic biographer. Whether it 
is all literal truth, one may pardonably ques- 
tion. Certain real characters and certain real 
incidents undoubtedly inspire the writer's 
pen, and if there is a tendency to trim and 
polish now and then, it is no more than lit- 
erary art seems to demand. In one chapter, 
for example, presenting the harrowing expe- 
rience of a woman who has cured herself of 
the morphine habit for it should be noted 
that two of the book's characters are women 
a suspicion of something like fiction is engen- 
dered by the story-teller's lack of consistency 
in making the aforesaid habit one of ten 
years' duration on one page, and of twenty- 
five years' on another. An occasional unusual 



word or unorthodox spelling distracts the 
critical reader's attention from the narrative, 
as where "rehabitate" is used in the sense of 
rehabituate, and " cachination " is made to do 
duty for cachinnation. Four illustrations add 
to the interest of these touching tales. 



We all have bodies, and we are 
toMag l e. e all interested in their preserva- 
tion. Hence the universal ap- 
peal of such a book as Dr. Henry Smith 
Williams 's "Adding Years to Your Life" 
(Hearst's International Library Co.), which 
is made up of popular articles on hygiene that 
have already found favor with magazine- 
readers. They deal with the problem of 
longevity, the battle of the microbes, how to 
outwit the messengers of death, the health of 
the brain, the condition of the nerves, the care 
of the eyes, and the rearing of children. 
Touching briefly on Professor Metchnikoff's 
sour-milk treatment for the prolongation of 
life, a treatment that had its origin only a 
comparatively short time ago, the author 
says: "It must be admitted, however, that 
the results of this treatment have not been 
convincing to the mass of the profession." 
But how should they be convinced so soon? 
Give Dr. Metchnikoff a century or so, and who 
knows but he will prove his point? Chief 
among the simple means for prolonging our 
life would seem to be care in eating and the 
taking of daily exercise. But how many even 
of those that read the book will give proper 
attention to these matters? As the author 
says in conclusion, ' ' the great difficulty is that 
most people cannot be induced to shut the 
barn door until after the horse is stolen." 



When the pen of a Silvio Pellico 
or a Dostoieffsky turns to the 
portrayal of prison life from the 
inside, the result is pretty sure to be a vivid 
and soul-stirring piece of literary art. in 
which, however, art is so far subordinated to 
nature and reality that no thought of the 
craftsman's skill is present in the reading. 
A narrative of experience behind stone walls 
and iron bars from the son of the author of 
"The Scarlet Letter" offers at the outset 
strong hope of something extraordinarily in- 
teresting, and in ' ' The Subterranean Brother- 
hood" (McBride), by Mr. Julian Hawthorne, 
the reader will not be disappointed in his ex- 
pectation of an engrossing bit of autobiog- 
raphy. The chain of events that led to Mr. 
Hawthorne's year of residence at Atlanta as 
a guest of the government is already too well 
known to call for recapitulation so well

known, in fact, that the author himself barely 
alludes to the circumstances, and that chiefly 
by way of passing comment on the absurdity 
of the notion that he is a desperate criminal 
whose personal freedom endangered the pub- 
lic welfare. What he concerns himself with is 
the penal system in general, and as illustrated 
in the Atlanta penitentiary in particular; 
and he also touches on certain absurdities of 
our legal machinery as they present them- 
selves to a shrewd observer in our criminal 
courts. That prison reform still has much to 
accomplish even after the much that it has 
already accomplished, is undeniable, and this 
truth is emphasized by the wealth of indi- 
vidual experience and observation contained 
in Mr. Hawthorne's gruesomely interesting 
book; but that prisons themselves should be 
abolished and the very term "criminal" be 
expunged from the language, is not so self- 
evident at present. Yet this is what the 
author urges, and if practice would only har- 
monize with theory his argument would be 
unanswerable. At any rate, his book is a 
notable and should prove a not unfruitful 
'contribution to the literature of penology. 



For many years the entomolo-

investigations of the various insects which 
invade orchards, destroy berry crops, and 
infest vineyards at the expense of the horti- 
culturist. The probable total annual loss in 
this country from this cause has been esti- 
mated by Dr. Quaintance to be over sixty 
millions of dollars. The leading centre for 
this investigation has been the station at Cor- 
nell University in conjunction with the New 
York State College of Agriculture. The re- 
sults of the work have been assembled by the 
late Professor M. V. Slingerland and com- 
pleted by his colleague, Professor C. R. 
Crosby, in a "Manual of Fruit Insects" 
(Macmillan) . The work is a richly illustrated 
handbook of the insects affecting the apple, 
pear, quince, plum, peach, and cherry, and the 
various berries, such as raspberry, blackberry, 
dewberry, currant, gooseberry, and strawberry, 
and also the grape and cranberry. The closing 
chapter deals with the preparation and appli- 
cation of insecticides. The work is complete, 
thorough, and accurate. It provides a very 
welcome compendium for both the fruit- 
grower and the entomologist. The life his- 
tories of the various insects are described and 
figured so that the non-technical reader can 
make use of them, and the effects of the 
attacks of insects are in most cases fully 
illustrated.

Miss Marie Corelli's latest novel, "Innocence," 
which it was expected would be indefinitely post- 
poned owing to the war, is now announced for 
publication at an early date by Messrs. George H. 
Doran & Co. 

" Lippincott's Magazine," until now published 
by Messrs. J. B. Lippincott & Co., at Philadelphia, 
has been taken over by Messrs. McBride, Nast & 
Co. The editorial offices will be removed to New 
York City but no change in the character or policy 
of the magazine is announced.

"The Death of a Nobody," by Mr. Desmond 
McCarthy and Mr. Sydney Waterlow, will be 
issued at once by Mr. B. W. Huebsch. It will be 
followed shortly by M. Sorel's "Reflections on 
Violence," a book which is said to state fully the 
position of the chief philosopher of syndicalism.

WINSLOW HOMER 

BY KENYON COX 

Crown octavo. Illustrated in color and photogravure, includ- 
ing introductions of several pictures never before published. 
Limited edition of 300 copies on Dutch handmade paper, 
at $12.50 net. 

Mr. Cox estimates Winslow Homer as "the greatest of 
marine painters" and "one of the most remarkable per- 
sonalities in the art of this or any country in the latter part 
of the nineteenth century. " His exposition of the various 
excellences which enabled Homer to rise to pre-eminence 
as a painter is as masterly as it is illuminating, and his 
description of the development of Homer's art is both 
consistent and convincing.

The Death of a Nobody 

By JULES ROMAINS 

A French masterpiece ! With incomparable restraint and 
power it reveals the interwoven web of human relations, romantic 
from their very prosaicness. The life of one in others' minds the 
"social consciousness" about which the soci- 
ologists have developed abstruse theories, is 
here portrayed explicitly, with a fascination no 
theory can have. The " Nobody " about whom 
the action revolves dies in the second chapter: 
then things begin to happen ! Though fiction, 
it supplies disturbing thoughts to doubters of 
life after death. Certainly no character in

Go with Dr. Covert 
Into the Heart of the Mountain Woods 

He makes his readers eager to go to the North Woods where he has 
used his ears and eyes to such good advantage; and satisfies the hunger 
of those who long for touch with the wild woods yet are unable to 
make the journey except by the aid of one who possesses the wonder- 
ful power to portray nature, as in this, his latest book.

Author of " Glory of the Pines" Illustrated, $1.50 net 

The little stream, with its gentle and artistic accompaniments, is a

defies it. It presents us an alluring invitation to fellowship, all the 
while beguiling us with a beauty that is born of mystery and silence. 
The nerves of a tired man ***** w jH fi n d mo re recreating rest in

SCRIBNER BOOKS 



BY J. M. BARRIE 

HALF HOURS 

A book of plays, including: "Pantaloon," "The Twelve- 
Pound Look," " Rosalind," " The Will." 

The contrast between the delightful romantic fantasy of 
" Pantaloon" and the present-day realism of " The Twelve- 
Pound Look" represents the wide scope of Sir James Barrie's 
dramatic work. All four of the plays in this volume, though 
their subjects are quite diverse, are beautifully suggestive of 
Barrie at his best, with all his keenest humor, brightest sponta- 
neity and deepest insight. $1.25 net; postage extra. 

THE CRUISE OF THE 
"JANET NICHOL" 

The Diary of Mrs. Robert Louis Stevenson. 
There can be no greater inspiration and 
pleasure for lovers of Stevenson and his 
work than in the diary of his wife, written 
during their cruise in 1890, with no 
thought of publication, but, as she says, 
"to help her husband's memory where his 
own diary had fallen in arrears." 
Fully illustrated from photographs taken 
during the trip and from other sources. 
$1.75 net; postage extra.

life. $1.50 net; postage extra. 

THE BRITISH EMPIRE AND THE 
UNITED STATES 

By William Archibald Dunning 

With an introduction by the Right Honorable Viscount Bryce, 
and a preface by Nicholas Murray Butler. 

Here is a book of immediate importance. In this time of 
European war the subject of the century of peace between 
England and the United States cannot help being of the most 
intense interest. $2.00 net; postage extra. 

OUTLINES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 

By Charles H. Stockton 

Admiral Stockton's practical experience in dealing with the 
complex problems and delicate situations in connection with 
international law renders him especially well qualified to speak 
with authority at this moment on a subject of such immediate, 
timely interest. $2.50 net; postage extra. 

GERMANY AND THE GERMANS 

By Price Collier 

A new and cheaper edition, at half the former price. A signifi- 
cant sentence from this book: "We shall have war when the 
German Kaiser touches a button and the German people will 
have no more to say in the matter than you or I." 
75 cents; postage extra.

pects of every state and prov- 
ince between Texas and Alaska

and the Amazon, and a trip down the " Unknown River." 
$3.50 net; postage extra. 

THE GRAND CANYON 
AND OTHER POEMS 

By Henry van Dyke 

This collection of Dr. van Dyke's recent 
verse takes its title from that impressive 
description of the Grand Canyon of Ari- 
zona at daybreak, which stands among 
the most beautiful of Dr. van Dyke's 
poems. The rest of the collection is 
characterized by those rare qualities 
that, as The Outlook has said, have 
enabled the author "to win the suffrage 
of the few as well as the applause of the 
many." $1.25 net; postage extra. 

A GREAT PEACEMAKER 

The Diary of JAMES GALLATIN in 
Europe. From the American Peace

Albert Gallatin, who accompanied his 
father during the negotiation of the 
Treaty of Ghent and afterward during 
his ministries to France, 1815-23, and to 
England, 1826-27, is at least one of the 
most entertaining and enlightening com- 
mentaries on that period ever written. 
Illustrated. 8vo. $2. so net; postage extra. 

NOTES ON NOVELISTS WITH SOME 
OTHER NOTES 

By Henry James 

All of the essays in the volume, critical and commentative, 
have naturally the peculiarly high value inherent in anything 
by this writer, because of his almost isolated position of emi- 
nence among men of letters to-day, and his minute powers of 
vision and expression which enable him to see and reveal points 
of importance on art, literature, life invisible or inexpressible 
for any other writer. $2.50 net; postage extra. 

THE MAN BEHIND THE BARS 

By Winifred Louise Taylor 

Miss Taylor has for many years devoted her life to the study 
of prisons and prisoners, and her book contains studies of

of men who have served their terms, and the prospects and 
sources of their reform. $1.50 net; postage extra.

OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE EXTERNAL WORLD 

As a Field for Scientific Method in Philosophy 

BEING THE LOWELL LECTURES OF 1914 

By BERTRAND RUSSELL, M.A., F.R.S. Medium 8vo, Cloth. Price $2.00. 

"// is in every sense an epoch-making book: one that has been needed and expected for years. It also affords 
the key to the ' New Realism ' . . . and we urge every one of our readers to lose no time in possessing themselves 
of a copy. 1 ' THE CAMBRIDGE MAGAZINE. 

"THIS BRILLIANT, LUCID, AMUSING BOOK, which, in spite of a few stiff passages, every one can understand. 
. . . ."THE NEW STATESMAN. 

" The actual results already attained by the logical-analytical method must be gathered from Mr. Russell's own 
pages, but it is evident that their importance is not small. . . . Finally, in the most important chapters 
of the book, he lays before us the outline of a theory which may reconcile the world of physical science with the 
worlds of psychology and of common sense. . . ." THE SPECTATOR. 

"How can philosophy become scientific? Mr. Russell's answer is, in a word, that it can only do so by recog- 
nising that all philosophical problems are purely logical and by adopting a reformed logic. . . . Part of 
the subject is abstruse and absolutely fundamental, but it is handled with such masterly skill that the general 
reader has not the least difficulty in following the argument, and will even find himself excited and amused. 
. . ."THE SATURDAY WESTMINSTER GAZETTE. 

THE OPEN COURT PUBLISHING COMPANY 

122 S. Michigan Ave., CHICAGO 



Not in the least ephemeral, but standard history, the result of a life-time of labor by an able and 
devoted author; comprehensive though compact; logical in arrangement and academic in execution; 
the only work of the kind published in any language. 

HISTORY OF MEXICO 

By HUBERT HOWE BANCROFT 

In one vol., 581 pages, over 200 maps and illustrations. 

The work covers ten centuries of aboriginal culture well authenticated 
in hieroglyphic manuscripts and architectural remains; the conquest by 
Cortes, seemingly thrilling romance rather than substantial history; 300 
years of colonial regime under 72 Spanish governors, audencias, and vice- 
roys; then independence from Spain and nearly 1 00 years of republicanism, 
with attendant imperialism, intervention, and over 250 internal revolutions, 
the end not yet in sight. 

In graphic pages the book brings up the past, describes the present, and 
contemplates the future.

AMONG THE CANADIAN ALPS 

By LAWRENCE J. BURPEE. With four full-page illustrations in color, forty engravings 
and four maps. 8vo. Boxed. Cloth. $3.00 net. 

Starting with the early explorers and the first French settlers of Canada, the author 
brings his work down to the present day, devoting several pages to the wonderful 
plan of the laying out of the Canadian National Parks, the making of mountain roads 
where had formerly existed only an Indian trail. He cites many notable instances 
in mountain climbing, giving the experiences of numerous famous travellers. Mr. 
Burpee's descriptions of the gorgeous scenery that meets the eye as one crosses the 
Rockies, supplemented by the many excellent photographic reproductions, make 
this a most attractive and alluring volume.

None of Villon's expositors has pen-

scription upon the exact, unhesitating

"LE THEATRE MANQUE." 

Nearly every one is agreed that the theatre 
is not so vigorous and healthy a part of our 
life as it should be. Indeed, nearly every one 
has been agreed on that for ten years. But 
hardly any two critics are agreed as to what is 
the matter. No art has had so many physi- 
cians, or such willing and earnest ones, in the 
past decade as the theatre has. The result 
seems to be that the protests of those who are 
interested in the theatre have been rather 
more serious in the year just closing than they 
ever were before. Commercial managers 
frankly bewail the loss of the great paying 
audience that once was theirs. Theatre-goers 
complain bitterly that there is no longer any- 
thing worth seeing on the stage. Authors as- 
sert at least as roundly as they did ten years 
ago that their best work is ignored by the 
producers. Lecturers assure us that they do 
these things better abroad but that we only 
need repertory companies like those of Man- 
chester and Glasgow, or a movement like that 
of the Irish National Theatre, or actors like 
those of the Theatre Francais, or an audience 
like that of the Odeon, or a scale of prices like 
that of the New Folk Theatre in Berlin, or a 
sophisticated society like that of Vienna, to 
have a living art of the theatre. Mr. Percy 
MacKaye would approve a civic theatre and 
pageants; the Messrs. Shubert would decapi- 
tate all the critics now writing for the New 
York papers; the various attempts to im- 
prove on the commercial theatre would accept 
large additions to their subsidies. And mean- 
while the Drama League of Chicago, turning 
from the study of printed and acted plays to 
observe what is going on in the world, has ar- 
ranged a winter programme almost exclusively 
devoted to one aspect or another of the mov- 
ing-picture theatre. Perhaps the League feels 
that the anaemia which has resisted so many 
tonics is better abandoned for a robustness 
that never required any! 

But though the apathy so succinctly ex- 
pressed by the Drama League is apparently 
general, there are exceptions. One of these is 
Mr. Hiram Kelly Moderwell, who has just 
written a book, "The Theatre of To-day," full 



370 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16 



of studiously acquired information about the 
work that was being done in Europe before 
the war began and full of delight in the re- 
sults of it. His first chapter contains these 
paragraphs : 

" Ten years ago this book would have been writ- 
ten entirely about dramatic literature. At that 
time we thought of the institution of the theatre as 
being a collection of printed plays together with a 
few necessary buildings to present them in. ... 

" Now all this is changed. From an institution 
of one art the theatre has become in the space of 
less than ten years, an institution of all the arts. 

" Not that the theatre suddenly found its possi- 
bilities. . . . But the realization began to spread 
that the theatre was not merely an affair of spoken 
words and accompanying gestures. And suddenly, 
almost overnight, the thinkers saw the possibilities 
of universality in the theatre, and set out to develop 
them slowly, tentatively, but in a spirit of conse- 
cration which has given a largeness and dignity 
perhaps beyond any other art of to-day." 

And he proceeds through many interesting 
pages to justify this statement by recording the 
achievements of German, French, Russian, and 
English artists and engineers of the theatre. 
Mr. Moderwell's enthusiasm over the For- 
tuny lighting system (especially when it is 
used in conjunction with a Kuppelhorizont) , 
the revolving, sliding, rolling, and wagon 
stages of the Germans, the buildings of Pro- 
fessor Max Littmann (in which every specta- 
tor has a good seat) , the settings designed by 
Mr. Gordon Craig and M. Golovine, the color- 
schemes of M. Bakst, the atmosphere of Signer 
Appia, the inscenierung of Herr Max Rein- 
hardt and Mr. Granville Barker, is contagious. 
"We can hardly read his pages without wishing 
to build a small model theatre with which to 
conduct endless experiments in setting and 
lighting a stage. The two Harvard students 
who built a Kuppelhorizont in their room at 
Cambridge seem the most fortunate of men. 
Is not the stage picture at least as important 
as the easel picture? And is not the art of 
light capable of as great development as the 
art of sound, which is music? Furthermore, 
Mr. Moderwell points out that this new art 
new in its magnificence at least has already 
reached America. 'He asserts that in Boston 
Mr. Livingston Platt and Mr. Josef Urban 
have already made settings that challenge 
those of the Europeans. In Cambridge Mr. 
Samuel Howe has a studio which is that of an 
amateur only because American theatrical 
managers have not yet seen the possibilities of 
design and color on the stage. In the strictly 



commercial theatre Mr. Robert E. Jones and 
Mr. J. Maurice Hewlett, Americans both, have 
made artistic settings. Mr. Moderwell asks us 
to believe that such men as these will soon be 
numerous in America. 

We do believe it. We believe that the time 
has almost arrived when men utterly ignorant 
of color, and utterly incapable of design, and 
utterly unwilling to study the possibilities of 
the theatre as a medium of artistic expression 
will no longer plan the more important dra- 
matic productions in this country. But we 
do not believe the second part of Mr. Moder- 
well's syllogism. We do not believe that the 
most perfect artists of inscenierung imagina- 
ble will redeem the theatre in America. For 
the whole institution of the theatre exists for 
the purpose of presenting to an audience 
"spoken words with their accompanying 
gestures." It does not exist in order that 
architects may design admirable buildings for 
its audiences; it does not exist that painters 
may design beautiful settings for its stage: 
it does not exist that mechanical engineers 
may construct ingenious devices for its direc- 
tors ; and it does not exist that amateurs may 
play with lights and shadows on a Kuppel- 
horizont. All these persons are secondary. 
They are inessential. They are all very well 
as long as they are of use to the dramatist and 
all very wrong when they interfere with him. 
They have nothing to give us except as they 
give it through the dramatist. 

We shall never have a living art of the 
theatre until we have living dramatic authors. 
For the present, we may interest a few with 
performances of Euripides or astound our- 
selves with Mazda lamps, as the Chicago Little 
Theatre has done; we may import the plays 
of J. M. Synge and the Irish actors who so 
admirably speak them, as the Chicago Theatre 
Society has done; we may publish bulletins 
inferior to the causeries of the newspaper crit- 
ics of the plays we least dislike, as the Drama 
League in many cities has done. But we may 
not go to the theatre to see dramas springing 
directly out of our own time and our own life 
put upon the stage. The reason is not that we 
have the long-run system, or that our man- 
agers will do everything for money and noth- 
ing for anything else, or that we have no Max 
Reinhardt. The reason is that we have no 
dramatists. That is the weakness of the thea- 
tre in America, and the only weakness that 
supremely counts.

THE CRITICS OF CRITICISM. 



"Criticism," says Mr. Brownell in a char- 
acteristic, pregnant sentence, "criticism itself 
is much criticized, which logically establishes 
its title. ' ' Some years ago Mr. John McKinnon 
Robertson very neatly exposed the critics of 
criticism by revealing this same paralogism in 
their noisy remonstrances. Yet these tinsel 
Lucifers still swarm in the world. And, like 
the Baconians, with whom they have many 
points in common, they must be met with 
something more than a scornful Olympian 
silence. As Professor Bliss Perry has shown, 
in two recent articles much-discussed, they 
have their real grievances in abundance. From 
the days when Swift, himself a critic or noth- 
ing, cried out against the wretched hack- 
writers of his craft, "Kill the rats," to the 
days when William Morris grumbled, "To 
think of a beggar making a living by selling 
his opinion about other people," there have 
been causes a plenty for scev a indignatio from 
"artists." But their real reason for attack- 
ing critics lies in the fact that they, their 
friends, and their masters have been thumbed 
over by blinking criticasters. Why not, then, 
deny to poetry the right to exist on the same 
basis, because Shadwell, and Tate, and White- 
head, and Pye, and Tupper grated on their 
scrannel pipes of wretched straw verses as flat 
and insipid as their names? The great critic 
is as rare as the great poet and as eminent. 
But every one who seriously proposes to be a 
rich-spirited citizen of the world can and must 
toe poetical and critical. 

The critics of criticism, then, must not utter 
their bitter whims if by chance they have any 
relic of respect for logic. But their con- 
demnation to silence on this score is more 
sweeping still. If they are poets and hate 
criticism, they must not talk about their 
poetry. For that is criticism. Indeed, they 
must not show, even by a scornful lift of an 
eyebrow or a delighted flash of the eyes, their 
contempt or their admiration for the work of 
a brother bard. For these things are criticism. 
Whistler's desire that his paintings be re- 
ceived in silence should have been more fully 
worked out into its solemn absurdity. Let us 
imagine an ideal audience for these impatient 
poets and novelists, sculptors, musicians, archi- 
tects, and painters. These connoisseurs would 
move about the long halls of a gallery staring 
with studious blankness at the pictures, with 
ghostly footfalls, and arms laboriously limp 
and motionless, with faces as pallid and 
strange as those which may be seen in the 
drawings of certain cheap and insincere imi- 
lators of the admirable post-impressionists. 



Matthew Arnold turned the tables very 
happily on Wordsworth in his critico-phobia. 
"Is it certain," writes Arnold, "that Words- 
worth himself was better employed in making 
his Ecclesiastical Sonnets than when he made 
his celebrated Preface, so full of criticism, and 
criticism of the works of others?" There is a 
home-thrust for you! Many critics, nowa- 
days, are agreed with the poets that it is a 
dubious adventure for a versifier to fashion 
first, or accept, a Procrustean mould of canon 
and then attempt to pour into it his mercurial 
imaginings. But suppose Wordsworth had 
written and talked more prefaces and then 
applied them in revision to his "Excursion." 
Well, that may be asking too much from 
Wordsworth and any other established and 
illustrious poet. But observe that singers and 
novelists and indolent readers who are most 
fearful or contemptuous of criticism are often 
those who most sadly need it. They may have 
been burned in effigy by some futile criticaster. 
They may have been taught to hate a good 
book by some professor of English literature 
who is allowed through the ignorance, tol- 
erance, or indifference of regents or trustees 
to remain at his post and desecrate it. But 
if these railers against all criticism are still 
young and still plastic, let them look to the 
real critics and let them try to be critics them- 
selves. We know such a young poet, a scoffer 
of critics, who has published a good deal of 
promising work, whose spirit is ' ' apprehensive, 
quick, forgetive, full of nimble fiery and de- 
lectable shapes." He is fond of voicing the 
old absurdity that a critic is an abortive and 
disappointed artist. To take one instance of 
his abuse, we may remark that his attitude 
toward Walter Pater is expressed in a ridic- 
ulous, unquotable phrase, the only justifica- 
tion for which lies in its really vigorous, if 
meaningless, obscenity. He has been strongly 
influenced by two poets of recent days, both 
admirable taken singly, but exceeding dan- 
gerous in combination. His verse, volatile, 
often stirring, sometimes noble, tends, at 
times, to harden too readily into a kind of 
rhetorical lava and to become very thin. He 
has all the marvellous gifts and faces all the 
deadly perils of improvisation. His lines 
glitter but seldom glow. At worst he falls to 
jingling. But he has one rare and highly 
poetic quality which ought to save him 
magnanimity. And when his magnanimity 
impels him to think with more charity of criti- 
cism he will be a richer poet than he now dares 
hope to be. 

The prejudice against criticism is probably 
largely due to the fact that it is a parvenu 
among the other artistic genres. People forget

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16 



the late birth of other forms, that after the 
epic, the lyric, the tragedy, and the comedy 
had been perfected in Greek literature the 
novel began to emerge in the rather hectic 
and amorphous work of Heliodorus, Achilles 
Tatius, and others ; that in England the great 
dramas were synchronous with the novel in its 
nonage, ' ' Doctor Faustus ' ' with ' ' Menaphon, ' ' 
"Love for Love," a marvel of structure and 
dialogue," with the vivid and racy and im- 
mortal but elementary "Colonel Jack"; that 
the novel reached perfection with Fielding 
only when poetry grew spectre thin and fell 
dead. We have said that great critics are as 
rare as great poets. And as we call the meagre 
roll of supreme critics we realize that fully 
a third of them belong to the last hundred 
out of the many thousand years that have 
marched silently with the human race. Let 
us all be wary of Professor Saintsbury's sug- 
gestive but dangerous definition of criticism 
as merely what men "have said about litera- 
ture." We should count Plato among the 
critics (although he is claimed also by the 
philosophers with perfect justice and, almost 
as plausibly, by some poets, by Shelley, for 
instance, in his "Defense of Poetry") and 
hail the imperial Greek as the supreme master. 
After Plato we find that among the half-dozen 
greatest critics from Aristotle to Lessing, 
while there is luminous thought, there is 
seldom the magic that we call style. Perhaps 
Aristotle's style in his finished work was 
greater even than Plato's. But of this we 
know nothing. In the mellow but sometimes 
overripe work of Cicero the style is rich but, 
after all, too studied, not quite the man. 
Dryden has style, but that was because he 
anticipated some of the methods of the critics 
who came when criticism first asserted itself 
as a genre. Dryden, in other words, could be 
impressionist as well as judicial critic. It was 
impressionism, as it appears in solution with 
other methods in work as different as that of 
the alert portrait-maker, Sainte-Beuve, and the 
divine chit-chat of Charles Lamb, that gave to 
critics the exhilaration, the suave fluidity, the 
curious incisiveness, the splendor (if we re- 
member Taine, for all his formulae ) , the glow, 
which we call style. For impressionism began, 
more fitfully and more soberly, before the 
days of M. Anatole France and Jules Le- 
maitre. And, though we may well hold austere 
vigil over the wonder-working caprices of the 
impressionist, we owe to his delicately lawless 
blend of authentic fire with his delightful and 
vexatious cajolery a new substance which has 
filled the dry veins of the old methods of 
criticism with something light and bright like 
quicksilver, not blood but ichor, the sap of art 



and immortality. All our great Victorians 
are at present the storm-centres of fierce blame 
and passionate lauds, and it may seem to many 
quite futile to prophesy in the midst of these 
murky clouds and capricious lightnings. Yet 
we dare assert that because of the new life 
which came into criticism, which gave it a 
sense of liberation and the magic of style, the 
great Victorian critics, men like Ruskin and 
Carlyle, will emerge from the storm more ma- 
jestic with their scars, as lofty and mountain- 
massive as men like Tennyson and Browning. 
Their heresies were great. But observe that 
(for all their narrownesses) they were freer 
than any of the poets of their period from the 
curse of Victorianism, from idealism of the 
whipped-cream variety. Let economist and 
painter and architect and poet strip away the 
last bright shred of charlatanism and warped 
absurdity from them ; their magisterial robes, 
shaken free by wholesome scorn of the more 
tawdry habiliments with which they half sub- 
merged their own true grandeur, will appear 
the more opulent and stately. And for their 
Promethean audacities they will be released 
from the Caucasus and placed among the 
gods. 

Whether the poets, painters, novelists, acad- 
emicians, and self-sufficient readers like it or 
not, criticism, the new genre, has already won 
the heights and is ennobled among the fine arts 
in the book that registers eternal values. It 
remains for the critics themselves (careless of 
the old charge of arrogance which has always 
been urged against them) to dynamite those 
two mildewed and fallacious conceptions: the 
fata Morgana of a belief that there is an 
antithesis between criticism and creation, the 
pernicious half-truth that criticism is at two 
removes from life. To give the quietus to the 
outworn and mischievous antithesis between 
criticism and creation we must, like Spenser's 
Britomart, see everywhere writ over the portals 
in the Daedalian halls of our castle of strange 
adventure, "Be bolde," "Be bolde," and yet 
also, "Be not too bolde." We must not in 
our arrogance jettison the old sane and pene- 
trating ways of judging and admonishing that 
the critics learned with so many centuries of 
toil. Professor Irving Babbitt has given us a 
weighty and memorable exhortation to blend 
judicial and impressionistic methods. His 
warning and his ideal are likely to have a 
permanent importance for us. On the other 
hand, we must be bolder than Matthew Arnold, 
who admitted an antithesis between criticism 
and creation. For in the prose of Arnold, that 
Olympian turned to stone in mid-youth, we 
shall observe, in his timorous shrinking from 
that lyrical intimacy and rich wistfulness 



THE DIAL 



373 



which gave us a few precious paragraphs like 
the close of his introduction to his ' ' Essays in 
Criticism" and the opening of his essay on 
Emerson, we shall observe in this pseudo- 
stoical restraint the disastrous effect of his 
belief in the antithesis between criticism and 
creation. We shall understand that our poet 
friend had caught part of the truth (but not 
the whole truth) when he maintained that 
criticism exercised a desiccating influence over 
Matthew Arnold. We must be more truly 
bold than Oscar Wilde, whose apparent para- 
dox that the critic is more creative than the 
artist is really nothing but a clever epigram- 
matic precis of the first part of Arnold's "The 
Function of Criticism at the Present Time," 
which supports a thesis that before the "cre- 
ative power" begins to work richly, sanely, 
and for all time there must always be great 
criticism to provide it "with elements, with 
materials" which criticism has made, or, in 
Wilde 's skilful turn of the phrase, ' ' created. ' ' 
Wilde, then, really saw an inconsistency in 
Arnold and in his foes. But the young 
hedonist was too perversely defiant; he sold 
his soul to snap at what he thought was a 
paradox. To be sure, real paradoxes are fonts 
of wisdom. But what of quasi-paradoxes ? We 
must not be too bold, but we must be bolder 
than Mr. Paul Elmer More, who, in his dis- 
tinguished essay entitled "Criticism," would 
assign the critic a certain pre-eminence by 
placing a Cicero above a Saint Paul, Erasmus 
above Luther. We need not thus refer the 
matter to Dionysius and his grandiose scales. 
Let us compare the ways of the poet with 
those of the critic without thought of superi- 
ority or inferiority. And let us ask once more 
whether there is any real antithesis between 
criticism and creation, whether it is really 
suggestive to describe criticism as at two re- 
moves from life. In a certain grove there is 
a quiet pool. To this go many of us who are 
laymen and one who is a poet. We laymen 
watch the sun-shafts strike the pool and grow 
meditative over the changing shadows. We 
say nothing, or we struggle with some banality, 
or we abuse some adjective whose mintage has 
been worn smooth by irreverent and blunder- 
ing thumbs, or we explode with a bit of grace- 
less slang. The poet writes a lyric. As we 
read it we cry: "This utters what we felt 
but could not say ; and it is divinely colored, 
moreover, with the unique personality of the 
singer." Then we add that it is a good poem, 
that it is "beautiful," "stunning," "bully," 
" damned fine" ; or, perhaps, we read it with- 
out a word. Then comes the critic who shat- 
ters our ideal with wholesome disillusion if the 
poem is bad, who praises it if it is good and 



writes about it a paragraph so magical, so 
eloquent, that it gives us a new ecstasy. ' ' This 
is what we were 'with child' to say," we ex- 
claim. We are delighted, too, with what we 
could not have said had we been articulate, the 
glamour of the other individual. Wherein 
does the paragraph differ from the poem as 
creation? The critic is, you rejoin, at two 
removes from life. Why not say that his 
criticism is life sublimated? Moreover, criti- 
cism can never be at two removes from life 
and sound criticism's deepest notes. If you 
write a book on Shakespeare, you must not only 
try to interpret the recesses of his mind, the 
long avenues of his vision through his plays, 
to reveal a person far more real than many of 
his contemporaries, and yours, who are con- 
sidered legitimate material in art; but you 
must make contrasts and comparisons from 
your first-hand observations of life about you. 
If you write about Spenser's Sir Artegall, the 
giant, and the mob, you will do well if you 
remember vividly the hours you spent on some 
city street watching the lean, eager, unshaven 
profiles of laborers and listening to the fierce 
accents of a speaker for the "International 
Workers of the World." If you would de- 
lineate Spenser's Radigund and Britomart, 
you had best be able to say something about 
later-day feminism. If you grow ardent over 
the splendid vision of imperialism shadowed 
forth in "The Faerie Queene," you should 
weigh Spenser as prophet by thinking of the 
spacious growth of her empire in later cen- 
turies and then of her terrific entanglement 
with Triple Entente and Triple Alliance. And 
as Marlowe took his portrait of Faustus partly 
from an old book and partly from his observa- 
tions of some crony, some "university wit," 
so you will make your portrait of Marlowe out 
of his works, his life, and verify and vivify 
your material out of your penetrating glances 
at your neighbors, your casual glimpses of 
strangers from far lands, your friends, your 
foes. 

Finally, English criticism need not go in 
russet ; it may well flush to a sudden splendor 
as in woods over night in a soft rain and in a 
brisk frost at smoky dawn in October. And 
the work of a true critic is a wizardry that can 
make an audience as children, saucer-eyed 
before a teller of tales, a pied piper. In these 
days he must not be, as Mr. Howells, in a mood 
of inconsistent petulance, once pronounced 
him : one who ' ' has condemned whatever was, 
from time to time, fresh and vital in litera- 
ture. ' ' Eather he is, in the fine phrase of Mr. 
Henry James, a "torch-bearing out-rider." 
Remember Baudelaire on Wagner. The critic 
is as adventurous as the poet. He is lighted

on his happy journey, now by shy stars visible 
only to him, now by the rich lanterns of the 
galleon-moon which seems to ride buoyantly 
over the endless, soft, and sullen seas of space 
on an infinite voyage like his own. Like the 
dreamer in "The Critic as Artist," he walks 
by moonlight and his punishment and his 
reward is to see the dawn before the rest of 
the world. HERBERT ELLSWORTH CORY. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



CONSPIRACIES OP SILENCE, or what seem to 
be such, on the part of those who make our 
reference books, must have been noted by 
every habitual user of those indispensable 
literary tools. Almost beyond belief is the 
unanimity with which the most important 
and, one would think, the most easily obtain- 
able information on a given subject is some- 
times withheld by all the encyclopaedias and 
dictionaries and yearbooks and other reposi- 
tories of general intelligence. For example, 
the writer of this had occasion a few days ago 
to need a brief and definite statement of the 
period of Roman history covered by the five 
extant books of Polybius's forty-book histori- 
cal work. Having no copy of Polybius at 
hand, he turned with confidence to Smith's 
"Classical Dictionary," school edition; but 
though an article of reasonable length is there 
devoted to the historian, and though the scope 
of his entire work is indicated and the sur- 
vival of the first five books is stated, no men- 
tion is made of the period covered by those 
books. However, this was considered pardon- 
able, though a little surprising, in an elemen- 
tary reference book. Recourse was next had 
to the new and much- vaunted ' ' Encyclopaedia 
Britannica," where a four-column account 
of Polybius at once offered cheering promise 
of the desired aid. But it was a fallacious 
promise. With tiresome particularity every- 
thing except the one little point required was 
found duly set forth by the erudite writer: 
the character and scope of the history, with 
criticism of its style and comparison with 
other similar works, and a statement of what 
proportion of the whole was extant, were 
properly placed before the reader, and every 
now and then the writer seemed on the point 
of giving, as he could have done in three 
words, the one item of information sought 
for; but somehow, with admirable ingenuity, 
he always succeeded in avoiding the issue. 
Then the large and excellent classical diction- 
ary published by the Harpers, and edited by 
the late Professor Peck, was consulted, with 
exactly the same result as before. After that 



Anthon and the "Encyclopaedia Americana" 
were pressed into service, and still other books 
of reference after them, but always to no pur- 
pose. If the compilers had met in formal 
conclave before entering upon their several 
tasks, and had signed a solemn compact to 
withhold this one piece of information, they 
could not have shown greater unanimity of 
secrecy on that subject. Doubtless there are 
many similar and even more tear-compelling 
tales of woe that other users of reference 
books could unfold if they chose. 


TREITSCHKE 's CASUISTRY is strikingly ex- 
emplified by some passages from his class- 
room lectures as quoted by Professor Henry 
W. Farnam, of Yale, in "The Yale Alumni 
Weekly." First, of the man himself he says 
that Treitschke was "a very large man, with 
a strong face and a decidedly impressive per- 
sonality, and the defect in his speech was 
due to deafness caused by sickness in his 
youth, in consequence of which he was unable 
to modulate his voice. It was indeed so diffi- 
cult for a beginner to understand him at all, 
that during the first half of the first lecture 
of his which I attended, I could not make out 
what he was talking about, and felt that I 
should have to give up the course. Then I 
suddenly found my ear attuned to his pecul- 
iarities, and in time the very defects of his 
elocution seemed to lend emphasis to what he 
said." From his notebook of thirty-seven 
years ago the writer quotes this fragment of 
a lecture: "The purpose of the State is 
power, and nothing can be more moral than 
this purpose. The statesman is often in a 
position to choose between two evils in order 
to maintain this highest good, but the diplo- 
matist lies (if he does it) for the advantage 
of the State, while the merchant lies for his 
own advantage. The impulse of a youthful 
State to destroy an old and decaying State is 
higher than all maxims of positive law. The 
statesman who acts unwisely is immoral." 
And in still more unmistakable terms: 
"When a State has the choice between the 
moral and the immoral it should choose the 
moral, for good faith is in politics a real 
power, but it is often possible to obtain a 
moral purpose only by immoral means, al- 
though not every moral purpose sanctifies 
immoral means." That this Jesuitical doc- 
trine, as well as other precepts inculcated by 
the lecturer, aroused occasional protest, ap- 
pears from further remarks of Professor Far- 
nam. " The vigor of his [ Treitschke 's] utter- 
ances often called forth strong opposition 
among the students, which they expressed, 
according to the German custom, by rubbing

THE DIAL 



the floor with the soles of their shoes. Al- 
though Treitschke was stone deaf, it seemed 
as if he must have felt these demonstrations 
in some way, possibly through the vibrations 
of the floor, for whenever one occurred, he 
would hit back with some oracular utterance 
like a sledgehammer, calculated to crush, if 
not to convince, his critics." The Treitschke 
leaven of a generation ago was evidently not 
deficient in ferment. 



THE ADHESIVE READER deserves a passing 
word. We have long had the gentle reader, 
the patient reader, the indulgent reader, the 
intelligent reader, and, more recently, the 
duck-back reader, or the reader who reads 
everything and retains nothing; and now it 
is time we had an adjective to designate a 
certain well-known type of reader whose 
chosen haunt is the reading-room of public 
or semi-public character, and who contracts 
an incurable habit that suggests the propriety 
of dubbing him "the adhesive reader." No 
matter how early or how late you seek your 
club reading-room or your public library 
reading-room, in the hope of snatching a five- 
minutes' glance at your favorite daily paper 
or monthly magazine before proceeding on 
your way to more pressing concerns, the adhe- 
sive reader is there before you, stuck fast to 
the sheet you are so desirous of scanning, 
plodding laboriously through its successive 
columns, and making about as rapid progress 
as a fly crawling through a pot of glue. Two 
minutes, perhaps one minute, could at need 
be made to suffice for your quick mastery of 
all that the paper contains of importance' 
of such meagre fragments of authentic war 
news, for instance, as you especially wish to 
glean and you may perhaps constrain your- 
self to wait with outward composure during 
four of your allotted five minutes, in the faint 
hope of out-staying the adhesive reader by 
one minute and so capturing for that brief 
space the object of your quest. But if by 
chance you have the joy of seeing his eye 
travel to the bottom of the last page, let not 
your heart exult prematurely; he will still 
baffle you by turning back to read the paper 
(let us suppose it is the London "Times") 
all over again, or to absorb the advertisements 
and commit to memory the births, marriages, 
and deaths. If peradventure you catch him 
nodding over this task, think not to be able 
cautiously to remove his prey from his relax- 
ing clutch. He will be all alert at your first 
movement and will seem to take a malicious 
joy in your discomfiture. A clog to the read- 
ing-room machinery, he exults in his cloggish- 



ness. But is there no remedy? As a tenta- 
tive suggestion, why not let every journal and 
magazine in a public reading-room have its 
appropriate sand-glass stationed near it, an 
hour-glass for each of the monthly magazines, 
a half-hour glass for the weeklies, a five- 
minute glass for the daily papers, and so on ? 
A custodian could start the sand to running 
as soon as a reader took possession of a jour- 
nal or periodical, and when the top of the 
glass became empty that journal or periodical 
would be subject to surrender upon request. 
Thus at last might we be relieved of the 

incubus of the adhesive reader. 



PUZZLES IN PRONUNCIATION abound in al- 
most any author-catalogue of our literature. 
Who is there that can without a single slip 
run through a list containing such doubtful 
or difficult names as Behn, Tautphceus, 
Houghton, Besant, Palgrave, Beresford, Sea- 
well? Even at this late day the familiar 
names, Roosevelt, and Carnegie, and Goethals, 
and Loeb, are likely to be mispronounced. In 
order to remove doubt as to the proper pro- 
nunciation of a certain deservedly popular 
English author's patronymic we quote from 
a letter written by Mr. John Galsworthy to 
Mr. J. Walter Smith, London correspondent 
of the Boston "Transcript." Mr. Smith had 
asked Mr. Galsworthy how he pronounced his 
name, and the answer runs: "As to my 
name: It is one of those that to the end of 
time people will pronounce as sweet will 
moves them. It is an old Devonshire name 
and before my family migrated seventy to 
eighty years ago was pronounced with the A 
as in ' Wall ' and the S as Z. Some misguided 
person, I suppose my grandfather, yielding 
to the blandishments of the usual London 
pronunciation the A as in 'Gallon' and the 
S as Z tolerated and adopted that pro- 
nunciation, which I dislike. I have gone 
back to the old. Viola. ' ' There are those who 
hold that in order to derive real benefit from 
the study of a foreign language, even if one's 
purpose is merely to read its literature intel- 
ligently, its proper pronunciation must first 
be mastered. It may not be strictly necessary 
to know the pronunciation of an author's 
name before one can thoroughly enjoy and 
appreciate that author's works; but this 
knowledge is desirable and often very con- 
venient. 

THE MUSE OF THE "MOVIES" has her praises 
worthily sung in this year's Hardy Prize 
Poem at Williams College. While the theme 
is not the most exalted or heroic imaginable, 
the poet, Mr. Charles William Brackett, of 



376 



THE DIAL, 



[Nov. 16 



the senior class, has shown himself not unsuc- 
cessful in making it productive of thought and 
imagery of no mean or paltry character. 
"The New Muse" is the poem's title, with an 
explanatory sub-title. "In Praise of the 
Movies." The muse's shrine, her worship- 
pers, and some suggestive glimpses of the 
ceremonial within her temple, are presented 
in a dozen well-turned stanzas of eight lines 
each. As printed in "The Williams Alumni 
Review," the poem opens thus: 

" Her shrine is a narrow darkened room 
A gleam of light through a powerful glass, 
A speeding wheel and a smooth white screen 
Where her pageants of shadows pass; 
Shadows, but filled with a fire of life 
Treading the measures she bids them dance 
Mirth, Adventure, and Love and Death, 
The forms of a new Romance. 

"And though they are tawdry and dim at times, 
Their robes but pitifully fine, 
This muse can number more worshippers 
Than all the haughtier nine. 
This wonderful lady, this high Romance 
Stepped down from the ivory hall 
To give herself to the humble folks 
For almost nothing at all." 

"Her watchers," we are told, "are one with 
the listeners to Homer 's stories of Troy, ' ' and 
after one "has passed through the gate of 
the land of the stars, all for a five-cent fee," 
one "returns to the trudging life of the little 
everyday with a soul that droops less wearily 
for the glimpse of far away." In closing 
tribute to the new muse, the poet sings : 
" She gives great gifts to her worshippers, 
Merciful gifts without cease, 
To the weary the gift of f orgetfulness, 
To the troubled the gift of peace." 


A BOOKSELLER OF THE OLD SCHOOL is pre- 
sented to us in annual portraiture on the 
cover of "The Old Farmer's Almanac," which 
has now made its appearance for the year 
1915, being the 123d issue of this noted pub- 
lication. Robert B. Thomas, whose face, with 
that of Benjamin Franklin, adorns the out- 
side of the almanac, published his useful lit- 
tle yellow-covered pamphlet, or at any rate 
offered it for sale, at his bookshop in Sterling, 
Mass. ; and as Miss Mary Caroline Crawford 
tells her readers in her book of this season, 
"Social Life in Old New England," at this 
little country bookshop he offered in 1797, as 
advertised in his almanac, a really remarkable 
list of standard works, considering the time 
and place. In poetry there were Goldsmith, 
Milton, Thomson, Young, Watts, and Ovid; 
in fiction, Fielding, Smollett, Sterne, Miss 
Burney, Mrs. Radcliffe, Johnson's "Ras- 



selas," Mackenzie's "Man of Feeling," 
Thomas Day's "Sandford and Merton," and 
also "The Arabian Nights," "Robinson Cru- 
soe," and the once popular but less whole- 
some imitation of the last-named, "The En- 
glish Hermit: or the Unparalleled Sufferings 
and Surprising Adventures of Philip Quarll, 
an Englishman : who was discovered by Mr. 
Dorrington, a British Merchant, upon an un- 
inhabited island, in the South-sea; where he 
lived about fifty years, without any human 
assistance." Thomas Paine, Rochefoucauld, 
and others represented the more serious de- 
partments of literature. Sterling even now is 
but a small village, of about a thousand in- 
habitants ; that it should have had a bookshop 
such as Thomas's, or any bookshop at all, a 
century and a quarter ago, is remarkable. 


A PROSE EPIC IN FOUR BOOKS, the joint prod- 
uct of two boys' literary efforts in one of the 
Hull House classes, is winning deserved 
plaudits from an admiring public. In 
strength and simplicity of style it reminds 
one of the great classics, of the Bible and 
Homer, of the Ramayana and the Mahabha- 
rata. And the brevity of it is not its least 
charm. We take the liberty to transcribe it 
in full. The theme is the making of the first 
United States flag, and the point or moral of 
the tale is obvious. "Book One. Wunst the 
soldiers fighting King George found out that 
they had to have a flag. The soldier that 
thought of it first said: 'Bill, we ain't got 
no flag,' and Bill says it was so. Book Two. 
So they went to General George Washington, 
the Father of His Country, and they says to 
General Washington, 'General Washington, 
we ain't got no flag. Ain't it fierce? ' And 
General George Washington says, 'Yes, that's 
so we ain't got no flag. Ain't it fierce?' 
Book Three. So General George Washing- 
ton, the Father of His Country, went to Betsy 
Ross, who lived on the corner of Beacon and 
Chestnut streets, and General Washington 
says, 'Betsy, we ain't got no flag. Ain't it 
fierce?' Book Four. And General George 
Washington says, 'Ain't it fierce?' again 
three times. And Betsy Ross she says, 'I 
shed say it is fierce, General Washington, the 
Father of His Country. Here, you hold the 
baby and I'll make one.' ' Acknowledg- 
ments are due to the New York "Evening 
Post" for the foregoing version of this strik- 
ing composition, which is given on the au- 
thority of Miss Jane Addams.

time ago there was introduced in the national 
House of Representatives, by Congressman 
Green of Iowa, a bill for the amendment of

town in which such library is situated, which 
books shall be admitted to the mails free both 
when so sent and when returned by parties 
residing on the rural routes to such public 
library." No announcement of the passage 
of this bill has yet made itself heard in the 
deafening headlines of our newspapers, and 
it is safe to infer that it still remains in its 
initial stage. Whether it is the proper busi- 
ness of the United States to relieve the sub- 
urbanite of the fatigue of going to town for 
his reading matter, may admit of argument; 
but as long as it is the privilege of any and 
every congressman to send out at public ex- 
pense as many tons of his own speeches (in- 
cluding the unspoken ones) as he wishes, and 
even to make still more questionable use of 
the mail service, so long might that service 
with entire propriety be made to minister to 
the cause of culture in our rural communities. 
The "Iowa Library Quarterly" calls atten- 
tion to the great benefit likely thus to accrue 
in calling into being new libraries in thinly- 
settled districts already having rural deliv- 
ery. Passage of the bill would operate to 
increase the taxable area, so to express it, 
from which a country library would derive 
its support. 

THE ONE ENGLISHMAN APPRECIATIVE OF 
GERMAN CULTURE, so far as the much-quoted 
Professor Treitschke could determine, was 
Carlyle who was a Scotchman. But to 
Treitschke he was "the only Englishman who 
has thoroughly understood the Germans, and 
the first foreigner who has risen to the heights 
of German thought." At the other end of the 
scale in this eminent scholar's estimation 
stood the renegade Prince Albert, who was 
born and bred a German, but deliberately 
bartered his birthright for the hand of an 
English queen. All the bad things written by 
Treitschke about the hated islanders, years 
before the present international unpleasant- 
ness, would be terrible reading for an Anglo- 
Saxon if they were not almost comic in their 
exaggeration. A direct assault on the Amer- 
ican branch of Anglo-Saxondom is to be 
found in his treatise on "The Beginnings of 
German Colonial Policy," in which he says: 
"To civilization at large the Anglicizing of 
the German-Americans means a heavy loss. 
. . . Among Germans there can no longer be 



any question that the civilization of mankind 
suffers every time a German is transformed 
into a Yankee. ' ' So robust a faith in the sur- 
passing merit of one's own people and their 
particular brand of civilization is really 
splendid to contemplate.

LITEKATUKE AND WAE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

If I understand Mr. Moore's essay in THE DIAL 
of October 1, the writer, disgusted with certain 
popular stories, concludes that any upheaval is 
welcome which gives a prospect of their being 
superseded by another type of literature. What 
else can one understand from the plain statement 
that, " If the war with its seriousness and terror 
will deliver us from such base conceptions of life 
as are voiced in such literary work, it will be 
worth its cost " ? Because a critic's aesthetic sense 
is outraged, the moral sense of the world may be 
outraged as an antidote. Mr. Moore may be re- 
ferred to " Thoughts on This War," which Mr. John 
Galsworthy contributes to the November number of 
" Scribner's Magazine " : " Culture is not scien- 
tific learning ; culture is not social method and iron 
discipline; culture is not even power of producing 
and appreciating works of art though in these 
days you have not much of that. . . . Culture is 
natural gentility a very different thing." Thus 
Mr. Galsworthy, who is never vulgar and who prob- 
ably does not care for Get-Rich-Quick Wallingford. 

Mr. Moore's essay is interesting as giving an 
instance of the loose thinking of a certain class 
when they gird at the unfortunate peace advocate. 
To be sure he begins with disarming mildness : 

" Perhaps it is bad taste for Americans, who are 
apparently set as spectators of the present tournament 
of nations, to speculate on the literary consequences of 
the world war. But after we have paid our tribute of 
horror and pity to what are probably the most ap- 
palling events of recorded history, our spirits must rise 
to the majesty of these occurrences ; we must feel that 
they indicate or portend a great change in human 
thought." 

It is pleasant to hear Mr. Moore giving a passing 
sigh to the "horror" of the situation, else the 
reader might have supposed either that it has 
escaped his attention or that he has classed it all 
with the " hysteria " which he mentions in the next 
line. Most of us have not observed a great amount 
of hysteria. Horror there has been, and pity, 
among those who have imagination enough to grasp 
one-tenth of the misery involved; and there has 
been a wave of righteous anger against the men 
who are responsible for this state of things; but 
this is not necessarily hysteria. Perhaps Mr. 
Moore means to class all peace talk in this cate- 
gory. As a matter of fact the general feeling 
seems to be no more in sympathy with peace at 
any price than it is with Mr. Moore's jingoism. 
The prevailing sentiments are disgust and dismay 
at the war and its causes, and an equally strong 
desire to see the thing fought to a finish at what- 
ever cost.

THE DIAL, 



[Nov. 16 



Mr. Moore's next paragraph contains a sentence 
which General von Bernhardi might have written : 

" For ourselves vre think that this combative instinct 
is the glory of our race that it is a main force 
which keeps humanity from becoming dull, listless, 
enervated, and enslaved to sordid materiality." 

So many ideas crowd to the front on reading this 
sentence that it is difficult to keep them from 
toppling over one another. One remembers that 
the war was planned and precipitated by a country 
whose end was gain of a very material kind. One 
remembers that the palm for gallantry goes to the 
little peace-loving nation, a " nation of market 
gardeners," which is not fighting for military glory 
but the homely virtue of self-respect, a nation 
which asks nothing better than to be let alone to 
mine and till, weave and forge, in the land of its 
fathers. 

Few deny the righteousness of some wars, but 
to welcome the present horror for its exhibitions 
of courage is rather like welcoming a religious 
persecution that reformers may show their mettle, 
or like filling a region with a ruffian soldiery to 
give young women an opportunity to prove their 
courage by suicide. To enjoy a good fight is one 
thing. Most of us do, women as well as men. But 
to cry up war as an end in itself is not only 
hideously immoral; it is dangerous, since it is 
likely to land any people so obsessed just where 
Germany will sooner or later be. 

Mr. Moore hails the day when the flat, stale, and 
unprofitable literature of domesticity shall be 
swept away by an avalanche of war literature. 
" Poetry and war were one and indissoluble." But 
it is hardly just to lay all the sins of dullness and 
realism at the door of peace. To be sure, in war- 
time Mr. Moore's despised " average unimportant 
person " is apt to lose individuality in the great 
herd of common soldiers and non-combatants, but 
the novels of ordinary people and happenings are 
the result of the ever-growing conviction of the 
worth of every life and every class. And here is 
another instance of Mr. Moore's loose thinking. 
Miss Austen comes in for his contempt, but he 
plays into his critic's hand when he accuses her of 
superficiality. She was superficial. It is not 
because she deals with quiet happenings, but be- 
cause she never goes to the roots of things, that 
Miss Austen, exquisite though she is, cannot stand 
with the greatest. Mr. Moore would have made out 
a better case for his war literature had he proved 
that " The Newcomes " or Scott's own " Heart of 
Midlothian " is inferior to " Ivanhoe " or " Quentin 
Durward." 

And now I wonder that I have had the temerity 
to write this protest, for at such a time criticism 
from a woman, a creature incapable of "great 
passions and thoughts," must seem an impertinence. 
But from the context I gather that the great pas- 
sion which most interests Mr. Moore is the passion 
for war. Now it is only fair that that half of the 
human race which gets the most misery and the 
least glory out of a war should be heard when 
war is discussed. A woman is driven from place to 
place like a sheep. If she dares fight, as some of 
the Belgian women fought, in defence of her home, 



she receives none of the honors of a soldier, but is 
shot without ceremony. At all times she exists on 
sufferance. Sometimes in this year of grace she 
is outraged. Yet women, " frail bodies and gentle 
minds " notwithstanding, have rarely been behind- 
hand in patriotism. And I believe that most 
women as well as most men feel that, in this war 
at least, the way to peace is by the sword. But 
woe to him who exalts the sword as an idol. I 
read of towns devastated, of children starving, of 
beasts driven into barbed wire that cavalry may 
pass safely over their bodies, of young girls coming 
like hunted animals to the British rifle pits, and 
on top of all this I skim a chapter from a recent 
Avar novel. The chapter bears the uncompromising 
title of " Rape." 

Then some amused demon within me laughs, for 
in my mind's eye I see Mr. Moore (with all his 
womenkind presumably safe in this sordid land) 
taking refuge in these glories from the contamina- 
tion of " Potash and Perlmutter."

THE YOUNG FRENCH POETS. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In THE DIAL of October 16 there is an interest- 
ing article on the dynamic movement in contem- 
porary French poetry. I should like to express 
my pleasure at the significant definition of the new 
tendency, while taking exception to what is a slight 
mislaying of emphasis. It should be clearly realized 
that the leading spirit in this movement is M. 
Beauduin, rather than M. Guilbeaux, for he is the 
most intensely national of all the dynamic French 
poets. M. Guilbeaux's most important work bears 
the significant title, " Modern Berlin," and though 
he can scarcely be called a disciple of M. Beau- 
duin, he is easily second to the latter as an inter- 
preter of French nationalism. Moreover, a close 
acquaintance with the younger poets who are just 
beginning to try their wings will show that they 
are enlisting under M. Beauduin's banner. 

"La Vie des Lettres" has been the official 
organ of this movement which M. Beauduin calls 
" paroxysm," but which I prefer to call " dynam- 
ism." Young France to-day is enrolling under the 
standard of M. Paul Claudel or of M. Nicolas 
Beauduin, according as it inclines to passive or to 
dynamic life. Its most significant expression is 
found in " La Vie des Lettres " or in " La Nouvelle 
Revue Franc,aise," according as it follows M. Beau- 
duin or M. Claudel. " La Vie des Lettres " has now 
been discontinued, as M. Beauduin is fighting at 
the front, but he writes me that it will reappear 
after the war. The article by M. Beauduin from 
which Mrs. von Ende quotes is printed in English 
in the July- August number of "Poet Lore," with 
revisions by M. Beauduin. It is the manifesto of 
the dynamic movement. It is supplemented by 
M. Beauduin's article in the September number 
of " The Poetry Journal." M. Beauduin's most 
significant volumes, " The City of Men " and 
" The Cosmogonic Man," are being translated into 
English. EDWARD J. O'BRIEN.

THE GREAT WAR.* 



The European war has produced a flood of 
literature of all sorts. England and Germany 
have published ' ' White Papers, ' ' Russia, 
41 Orange Papers," and Belgium, "Gray Pa- 
pers," containing such portions of their offi- 
cial diplomatic correspondence as they sev- 
erally chose to make public in presenting 
their part in the negotiations resulting in war. 
A perusal, and still more a careful study, of 
these documents brings the conviction, not 
that any one nation is wholly in the wrong, 
but as each claims to be right that we 
need another and better standard of deter- 
mining what is right for a nation. 

This observation holds not only of the offi- 
cial publications but also of the increasing 
unofficial presentations of the several nations' 
cases. These latter are already numerous. 
To England's defence come Sir Edward Cook 
with a short summary entitled "Why Britain 
is at War, ' ' and Mr. J. M. Kennedy with the 
more extended "How the War Began "; both 
rest on the documents of the British "White 
Paper" and the speeches of Britishers, the 
texts of which they reproduce in part. "Why 
We Are at War: Great Britain's Case" is 
issued by the members of the Oxford Faculty 
of Modern History. Of the English presenta- 
tions at hand this is the best; with its intro- 
duction on the preliminaries of the war, and 
the text of the document, it makes a useful 
handbook. 

The Germans have not lagged in the com- 
petition to capture public opinion. We have 
at hand a pamphlet entitled "Die Wahrheit 
liber den Krieg," prepared jointly by Paul 
Dehn, Dr. Drechsler, Dr. Francke, and seven 
other prominent Germans, and known to have 
been circulated broadcast. It is this pam- 
phlet which (in a substantially literal En-

glish translation under the title "The Truth 
about Germany") was given to Americans 
leaving Germany. To counteract its influ- 
ence Mr. Douglas Sladen has written "The 
Real 'Truth about Germany' " which, taking 
up the German publication paragraph by 
paragraph, gives the viewpoint of the English 
in refutation. There are certain variations 
between the German text and that given as 
the text in the English edition by Mr. Sladen. 
The latter 's chapter "Who Is to Be Victo- 
rious?" (in which it is argued that Germany 
will not continue to respect the Monroe Doc- 
trine) does not appear in the original. We 
have no means of explaining this discrepancy 
and mention it without meaning to reflect on 
any one. But what of it ? A book of this kind, 
consisting as it does of opinions of men with 
different premises, converts but few. 

' ' The Case of Belgium in the Present War, ' ' 
the work of the Belgian delegates to the 
United States, is an account of the violation 
of the neutrality of Belgium and of the laws 
of war in Belgian territory by Germany. It 
contains diplomatic correspondence and the 
findings of the Belgian commission in the 
form of a number of surprising affidavits and 
statements of witnesses. These latter are in 
a number of cases not so convincing as to be 
above question. 

Another group of books, less directly con- 
cerned with the war but still a product of it, 
has begun to appear. "The Russian Army 
from Within" is the work of Mr. Barnes 
Steveni, who for twenty-seven years has lived 
in Russia. Though written in the greatest 
haste, the book is readable and instructive. 
The peasant, who, according to Mr. Steveni, 
is the backbone of the army, is of medium 
stature, and as a recruit more often than not 
illiterate, careless, procrastinating, happy- 
go-lucky, slavish, superstitious; the finished 
material is excellent, hardy, stubborn, self-sac- 
rificing, and ready to die, one of his proverbs 
being "Life is a farthing." He is a child of 
nature, easily satisfied, but also subject to fits 
of passion. ' ' A great fault of the Russian army 
is its poorly managed Commissariat. ... So 
long as the Russian Government persists in 
the questionable practice of paying its offi- 
cials and public servants about half the wages 
due to them this evil will never be eradi- 
cated." On the prospects of the war Mr. 
Steveni says, "it is difficult not to believe that 
Russia will emerge victorious . . . provided 
that her officers and generals are on a line with 
her brave and hardy soldiers, and that the 
alien races subject to her sway remain loyal." 

"The German Army from Within," by "a 
British Officer who has served in it" is a 



380 



[Nov. 1& 



moderately interesting account of personal 
experiences. It is unsympathetic and far 
from flattering to the German army. Says 
the anonymous author: "I speak with knowl- 
edge of both English and German soldiers 
privates, non-coms., and officers of rank 
and I am firmly convinced that one British 
Tommy is the equal of three Germans of the 
same rank"; and, elsewhere, "The artillery, 
too, is much given to stale technicalities, cir- 
cus tricks, and so on, and to adherence to 
conservative notions of artillery operations." 
However, these are merely opinions. What 
value this book has lies in its narrative of 
army life in Germany. 

"The Secrets of the German War Office" 
by the pseudonymous Dr. Graves is without 
a doubt the most thrilling reading in the list. 
It purports to be the experiences of a German 
secret agent, and the circumstantial story and 
the obvious knowledge of the countries visited 
as well as the specific facts mentioned, make 
it seem a true narrative. Chapters have been 
printed in magazines, which seem to take the 
story for what it pretends to be. Still, as 
someone has remarked, the author is either a 
faker or a traitor. Certain it is that the story 
of the secret agent 's betrayal by his own coun- 
try and his consequent defection to England 
is a bit thin. An acquaintance who claims to 
have been in the German secret service for 
some years declares the book to be a fake, 
though he admits that its author knows some 
of the practices of the German Intelligence 
Office. Whether the book is history or ro- 
mance it is fascinating reading and it is no 
wonder that the first edition was exhausted 
in two days and the second in two weeks. 

Two books by the oft-mentioned General 
von Bernhardi are at hand. "How Germany 
Makes War" is an English condensation of 
the German original published in 1911. It is 
a technical work which discusses the prob- 
lems of modern warfare and proposes certain 
changes in the methods now in use in 
Germany. General von Bernhardi is an ex- 
cavalry officer with wide experience and 
knowledge of military history. In this work 
he seeks to discover "not only the nature of 
war of today in theory, but also to develop 
from this cognition a superior principle of 
action, ..." 

" It seemed to me possible and useful to con- 
duct war from the outset in accordance with dis- 
tinct principles recognized a priori, and to master 
spiritually the powerful forces bound to be let 
loose in it, instead of leaving them to their innate 
impulses, in opposition to the Italian general who 
insists that in a war of the future only the original 
direction given to the masses can be intended, but 



that afterwards ' the stream will, so to say, move 
on automatically.' . . . We Germans shall in the 
next war ' be obliged to fight against enemies far 
superior in numbers, and shall therefore need spir- 
itual superiority to equalize the numerical one.' " 

The book which has made General von Bern- 
hardi famous, is "Germany and the Next 
War," first published in 1912. The vogue of 
this book in the present crisis, which is the 
"next war" the author had in mind, is indi- 
cated by the many editions appearing. The 
sudden demand of the reading public for this 
book may be explained in the words of Mr. 
Bryce. General von Bernhardi 's doctrines, 
based on Treitschke's, he says, "would have 
deserved little notice, much less refutation, 
but for one deplorable fact, that action has- 
been taken by the government of a great 
nation . . . which is consonant with them 
and seems to imply a belief in their sound- 
ness." General von Bernhardi has accord- 
ingly come to be regarded as the spokesman 
of the partly imagined and at best undefined 
Pan-Germanism, made so well-known in 
English-speaking countries by Mr. Roland 
Usher's clever book. 

Two chapters of Bernhardi are, at the pres- 
ent juncture, the most interesting, one on 
the "Character of Our Next War," the 
other on "The Next Naval War." We shall 
attempt a resume of these, giving the author's 
words where possible. 

"England, France and Eussia have a com- 
mon interest in breaking down our power. 
This interest will sooner or later be asserted 
by arms." For a continental European war, 
General von Bernhardi thinks, the British 
Territorial army may be left out of account as 
"its military value cannot be ranked very 
highly." Germany will have to deal only 
with the British regular army: 

" It is very questionable whether the English 
army is capable of effectively acting on the offen- 
sive against Continental European troops. In 
South Africa the English regiments for the most 
part fought very bravely and stood great losses; 
on the other hand, they completely failed in the 
offensive, in tactics as in operations, and with few 
exceptions the generalship was equally deficient. 
The last manoeuvers on a large scale held in Ireland, 
under the direction of General French, did not, ac- 
cording to available information, show the English 
army in a favorable light so far as strategical 
ability went. 

" The tactical value of the French troops is, of 
course, very high; numerically the army of our 
neighbour on the west is almost equal, and in some 
directions there may be a superiority in organiza- 
tion and equipment; in other directions we have 
a distinct advantage. The French army lacks the 
subordination under a single commander, the 
united spirit which characterizes the German army, 



1914] 



THE DIAL 



381 



the tenacious strength of the German race, and the 
esprit de corps of the officers. France, too, has not 
those national reserves available which would allow 
us almost to double our forces." 

In Russia "hatred of Germany is as per- 
sistent as ever," and public opinion would 
favor a war in the west. So far as Russian 
troops go they fight with great stubbornness. 
But in the Japanese war the "Russian army 
quite failed on the offensive, in a certain sense 
tactically, but essentially owing to inadequacy 
of the commanders and the failure of the 
individuals. ... It can hardly be presumed 
that the spirit of Russian generalship has 
completely changed since the defeats in Man- 
churia. . . . This army must therefore al- 
ways be met with a bold policy of attack." 
General von Bernhardi expects the revolution- 
ary elements in Russia (and also Japan and 
China in the East) to operate as restraining 
forces against Russia in the next European 
war one of the few instances in which he 
conspicuously misjudged what has happened. 
General von Bernhardi proceeds to consider 
what forces Germany can count on against 
England, France, and Russia. He does not 
regard the Triple Alliance as solid : 

" We are not even sure of their diplomatic help, 
as the conduct of Italy at the conference of Alge- 
ciras sufficiently demonstrated. It even seems 
questionable at the present moment whether we 
can always reckon on the support of the members 
of the Triple Alliance in a defensive war. ... If 
we consider how difficult Italy would find it to 
make her forces fit to cope with France, and to 
protect her coasts against hostile attacks, and if 
we think how the annexation of Tripoli has created 
a new possession, which is not easily defended 
against France and England, we may fairly doubt 
whether Italy would take part in a war in which 
England and France were allied against us. 

"Austria is undoubtedly a loyal ally. . . . Nev- 
ertheless, there is cause for anxiety, because in a 
conglomerate State like Austria, which contains 
numerous Slavonic elements, patriotism may not 
be strong enough to allow the Government to fight 
to the death with Russia, were the latter to defeat 
us. The occurrence of such an event is not im- 
probable. When enumerating the possibilities that 
might affect our policy, we cannot leave this one 
out of consideration. 

" We shall therefore some day, perhaps, be 
faced with the necessity of standing isolated in a 
great war of the nations, as once Frederick the 
Great stood, when he was basely deserted by En- 
gland in the middle of the struggle, and shall have 
to trust to our own strength and our own resolu- 
tion for victory. 

" Such a war for us more than for any other 
nation must be a war for our political and 
national existence. This must be so, for our oppo- 
nents can only attain their political aims by almost 
annihilating us by land and by sea. If the victory 



is only half won, they would have to expect con- 
tinuous renewals of the contest, which would be 
contrary to their interests. They know that well 
enough, and therefore avoid the contest, since we 
shall certainly defend ourselves with the utmost 
bitterness and obstinacy. If, notwithstanding, cir- 
cumstances make the war inevitable then the inten- 
tion of our enemies to crush us to the ground, and 
our own resolve to maintain our position victo- 
riously, will make it a war of desperation. 

" We must therefore prepare not only for a 
short war, but for a protracted campaign. We 
must be armed in order to complete the overthrow 
of our enemies, should the victory be ours; and, 
if worsted, to continue to defend ourselves in the 
very heart of our country until success at last is 
won. ... A nation of 65,000,000 which stakes all 
her forces on winning herself a position, and on 
keeping that position, cannot be conquered." 

General von Bernhardi 's forecast of the 
probable campaigns of Germany's "next war" 
(and particularly what he has to say about 
Belgium's place in them) has contributed 
more than anything else to give his book its 
wide notoriety : 

" If the war ... be waged against us [by 
France] in combination with England, it may be 
assumed that the allied Great Powers would at- 
tempt to turn our strategical right flank through 
Belgium and Holland, and penetrate into the heart 
of Germany through the great gap in the fortresses 
between Wesel and Flushing. This operation 
would have the considerable advantage of avoiding 
the strong line of the Rhine and threatening our 
naval bases from the land side. 

" The main issue for England is to annihilate 
our navy and oversea commerce, in order to pre- 
vent, from reasons already explained, any further 
expansion of our power. But it is not her interest 
to destroy our position as a Continental Power, 
or to help France to attain the supremacy in 
Europe." 

England's participation in the land war will 
show desperate energy "only so far as it pur- 
sues the object of conquering our naval ' 
bases. ' ' 

"Our western frontier," General von 
Bernhardi continues, "in itself strong, can be 
easily turned on the north through Belgium 
and Holland. No natural obstacle, no strong 
fortress, is there to oppose a hostile invasion, 
and neutrality is only a paper bulwark." 

In the naval actions of the "next war" Ger- 
many 

" will be thrown on her own resources and will 
have to protect herself singlehanded against supe- 
rior forces which will certainly press her hard. 
... As regards materiel and training, it may be 
assumed that our fleet is distinctly superior to the 
French and Russian, but that England is our equal 
in that respect. Our ships' cannons will probably 
show a superiority over the English, and our tor- 
pedo fleet, by its reckless energy, excellent training, 
and daring spirit of adventure, will make up some 



382 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16 



of the numerical disadvantage. It remains to be 
seen whether these advantages will have much 
weight against the overwhelming superiority of an 
experienced and celebrated fleet like the English." 

English commerce must be attacked : 

" The prizes which fall into our hands must be 
remorselessly destroyed since it will usually be im- 
possible, owing to the great English superiority 
and the few bases we have abroad, to bring them 
back in safety without exposing our vessels to 
great risks. The sharpest measures must be taken 
against neutral ships laden with contraband. Nev- 
ertheless, no very valuable results can be expected 
from a war aganst England's trade. 

" Under these circumstances, nothing would be 
left for us but to retire with our war-fleet under 
the guns of the coast fortifications, and by the use 
of mines to protect our own shores and make them 
dangerous to English vessels." 

" It would be necessary to take further steps to 
secure the importation from abroad of supplies 
necessary to us, since our own communications will 
be completely cut off by the English. The simplest 
and cheapest way would be if we obtained for- 
eign goods through Holland or perhaps neutral 
Belgium. . . ." 

General von Bernhardi is certain that Ger- 
many "must lose no time in preparing a road 
on which we can import the most essential 
foodstuffs and raw materials, and also export, 
if only in small quantities, the surplus of our 
industrial products." But without the aid of 
land forces to attack German naval bases from 
the rear, the allies, in his opinion, "could not 
obtain a decisive result." The prospect of 
any successful issue for Germany in naval 
warfare against the combined French and 
English fleet "shrinks into the background": 

" But we need not even then despair. On the 
contrary, we must fight the French fleet, so to 
speak, on land i. e., we must defeat France so 
decisively that she would be compelled to renounce 
her alliance with England and withdraw her fleet 
to save herself from total destruction. Just as in 
1870-71 we marched to the shores of the Atlantic, 
so this time again we must resolve on an absolute 
conquest, in order to capture the French naval 
ports and destroy the French naval depots. It 
would be a war to the knife with France, one 
which would, if victorious, annihilate once for all 
the French position as a Great Power. If France, 
with her falling birth-rate, determines on such a 
war, it is at the risk of losing her place in the first 
rank of European nations, and sinking into per- 
manent political subservience. Those are the 
stakes." 

A valuable commentary on General von 
Bernhardi 's book is "Germany and En- 
gland," by the late Professor Cramb, of 
Queen's College, London. This book, which 
was reviewed in THE DIAL of October 16, is 
an attempt to interpret to Englishmen what 



Cramb considered the newer spirit of Ger- 
many. As exponents of this German spirit he 
uses General von Bernhardi and men of his 
school, such as Ttreitschke and Delbriick. If 
General von Berhardi really represents a con- 
siderable influence in German thinking, and 
what Cramb wrote had any real influence in 
England, there is no wonder that the two 
nations are at war ; for neither book poured oil 
on troubled waters. EDWARD B. KREHBIEL. 



BLAKELOCK.* 



Not many know the work of Blakelock, even 
of those interested in American landscape, 
and of those few I should hardly claim to be 
one. Blakelock 's pictures are chiefly in pri- 
vate collections and are but rarely to be found 
in the great galleries. There are two (not 
very characteristic, as I remember) in the 
Metropolitan Museum, but I do not recall any 
in the galleries of Boston, Philadelphia, or 
Chicago, or in the Corcoran Gallery. Slight 
note of him will be found in the histories of 
art. He is commonly mentioned, in passing, 
among the "recent painters," but with little 
account of his art. It will be a surprise to 
some who know of him to know that he is still 
living, though of clouded mind. He will not 
be found in "Who's Who in America." 

Yet there are pictures of his that once seen 
make a very lasting impression. In the gal- 
lery of the National Museum are, or used to 
be, two, of which the sentiment has lingered 
long in my mind, even though the forms and 
subjects have vanished, a sentiment that seems 
indeed independent of the forms of nature 
which the painter has rendered. A discrim- 
inating critic has called Blakelock "that 
superb spiritualist of the woods," a phrase 
that points to something of the same sort. Of 
one of the Blakelocks of the Evans collection, 
exhibited some time ago at the Lotos Club, I 
read, "Nothing could be more romantic than 
this. A night sky, green with the moon's 
radiance; clouds that are tinted like smoke; 
a great high moon, its edges melting into a 
luminous haze a world simple yet indescrib- 
able, grand, and infinitely appealing. ' ' 

There is a particular quality in work which 
calls forth such expressions, something that 
the lover of art or nature may well desire to 
know. Other American landscape painters do 
not impress us in such a way. Not many of 
them would be thought of as romantic in any 
such a sense. If they are romantic it is with 
the romance of Thomas Cole or Frederick E. 
Church, now reviving in the ideals of later

men, the romance of mountain-height and] 
river-gorge, of torrent and precipice. Later 
landscape painters, with their feeling for the 
beauty of everyday nature and the exhilara- 
tion of sunlight, are not apt to be romantic. 
This is something different. With a view of 
appreciating such a quality, or at least of 
finding some definition of it, one may turn to 
Mr. Daingerfield's recent monograph. The 
book is one of the series which includes also 
the studies of George Inness and of Homer 
Martin, by Mr. Daingerfield and Mr. Mather. 
Blakelock is hardly a painter of such note as 
either of these: we rather regret that if a 
study is to be published, a beautiful book to 
be produced, it should not be of one of the 
greater men. We 'wish some one would write 
adequately of Cole or Durant, to tell us, at 
least, what they were in their own day and 
generation, if not still. But one may be 
thankful for whatever one can get in a field 
where special studies are so uncommon. 

On beginning Mr. Daingerfield's book one 
would perhaps get the idea that Blakelock had 
something particular to say, that his effort was 
to render some definite report of what he had 
learned from nature, that in his heart was 
some profound belief that he would share with 
us.* But such a notion would be mistaken, and 
indeed if one looked in Mr. Daingerfield's book 
for any definite belief or idea of Blakelock 's, 
one would be disappointed. Whatever report 
Blakelock would have rendered of nature, 
whatever he had to say as a result of his study 
of her, was something to be rendered or said 
in painter's medium only, something not to 
be put in definite form of words. This it is, 
perhaps, that leads one to say that there is 
something spiritual in his work, something 
independent not only of the material form, 
but of the intellectual idea as well. 

As to what this strange something is, Mr. 
Daingerfield gives us no very satisfactory ac- 
count, and that in part for the reason just 
given, that such things cannot be put into 
words. Just in so far as they are the painter's 
report they can be rendered by the painter 
only. Mr. Daingerfield has two means at hand :< 
he can offer description, and so he does, and 
he can offer illustrations. But neither means 
is adequate ; for photograph cannot give color, 
which in Blakelock is a necessary thing, and 
words tend to intellectualize. We do not en- 
tirely get the magic quality in the reproduc- 
tion of Mr. Clarke's "Moonlight," nor in this 
description : 

" Its beauty depends quite entirely upon the sky, 
there is little else. Slight trees above the earth! 

* See p. 10, where Mr. Daingerfield uses expressions of this 
sort. 



line, a very low horizon or sky-line, and the mys- 
terious glint of water somewhere out there among 
the shadows, but the great sky soars up from hori- 
zon to zenith, arching overhead superbly, and 
baffling all search in its gradations; the moon 
hangs low and fills the air with light, a faint haze 
surrounds it, almost a halo, and the light is that 
mysterious mingling of opaline colors merging into 
pale greens and blues, splendidly assembled, and 
performing their work of gradation quite per- 
fectly." 

Mr. Daingerfield has no idea that he is 
attaining the impossible in this description. 
He comments on his own work : 

"Authors and critics have an easy way of writing 
things about pictures which mean little, rhapso- 
dising sometimes and condemning at others, and 
always building up meanings for the reader's 
pleasure. Is n't it enough, perhaps, to say that a 
man's vision has been handed on to us by processes 
of perfect craft so that we are aware, completely 
so, of its beauty and haunting charm?" 

What, then, is to be said in a book on Blake- 
lock? It may be useful to some to have the 
facts of his life and his place in the develop- 
ment of the landscape art of our country. 
Others would like a list, even tentative, of his 
pictures and some definite idea as to where 
they may be found, so that they may get from 
the pictures themselves the pleasure they can 
never get from an account of them. Mr. Dain- 
gerfield does not concern himself with these 
matters, although he has a few anecdotes of 
the painter and with each illustration men- 
tions the place where the picture hangs. Fur- 
ther, one might want to know something of 
Blakelock 's technique, and on this matter Mr. 
Daingerfield has a good deal of information. 
But these things are slight compared with 
what we really wish to know about the painter. 

On this subject I believe the following will 
be of use: Blakelock cared comparatively 
little for form, either in his composition or in 
his rendering of particular objects. He was 
absorbed in other things. And this is some- 
thing that many people will like to appre- 
ciate. There is something in nature besides 
form, something that in many minds is infi- 
nitely superior to form. Many think that if 
you paint a tree people ought to know what 
kind of tree it is, whether oak or hop horn- 
beam or mulberry. Blakelock had no such 
idea: he would have distinguished probably 
between the elm and the banyan tree, but not 
by the shape of their leaves. He saw other 
things in nature, and one good thing about an 
appreciation of him is that it shows that there 
are other things than form to see. 

Of these other things color is one, and 
Blakelock certainly loved color, though Mr. 
Daingerfield does not think him a great color-

1st. Harmony of color or of value, then, may 
be looked for in nature or in Blakelock's ren- 
dering of her. But though harmony of color 
or of value is a beautiful factor in his work, 
yet it is never the one particular thing which 
he saw in nature, the particular matter of 
which he wished to make report, that seemed 
always to make the main impression on him. 

It is then a sentiment or an emotion that 
Blakelock conveys, rather than beauty of form 
or harmony of color, rather than idea or story. 
But his sentiment or emotion does not appear 
to be one of the common sentiments or emo- 
tions. It is not that he makes us melancholy 
or cheerful; it is something different, some- 
thing elusive, something that we call romantic. 

This, whatever it be, is the interesting thing 
about Blakelock. The earlier American land- 
scape artists were generally bent on rendering 
the more grandiose forms of nature, and the 
emotion which one may find in their works was 
the emotion of one who leaves a humdrum civ- 
ilization to commune with the spirit of some 
other world more attuned than ours to the 
higher aspirations of the soul. They gave us 
in picture what Byron gave in poetry. The 
later landscape painters from Inness down, 
have tried to reveal to us an other-world in 
the familiar lines and harmonies of the field 
and wood and meadow of every day. They are 
more like "Wordsworth. Blakelock does neither. 
His world is suggested by reality but it is his 
own. It is a painter's world and to come to it 
you must come by the painter's way. 

"We have here in painting one of the char- 
acteristics of much of the romance of the 
later nineteenth century, an inheritance of the 
extravagant individualisms of earlier years. 
Blake, long ago, the Rossettis, Morris, Swin- 
burne, Yeats, are poets who seek an other- 
world of poetic beauty, a world of their own, 
having but slight connection with the actual 
circumstance we know. Practical America 
cares little for these things, which is one rea- 
son for the older neglect of Blakelock. It is a 
good sign that he becomes more widely known.

JULIETTE DROUET AISTD VICTOR HUGO.* 



In 1833, Julienne Gauvain, formerly the 
model and the mistress of Pradier but then 
living with a Polish millionaire, was playing 
minor parts at the Porte-Saint-Martin under 
the stage name of Juliette Drouet. "When 
"Lucrece Borgia" was put on she took the 
part of Princess Negroni. It was in connec-

Edited by Louis Gimbaud. Translated by Lady Theodora 
Davidson. New York : McBride, Nast & Co. 



tion with this event that Victor Hugo first saw 
her; and in no long time Mile Drouet had 
renounced her millionaire and her career to 
become the mistress, the life-long friend, the 
most worshipful adorer, of the great poet. 
Hugo was already married, and his friends 
were amazed, as Mr. Davidson says in his ex- 
cellent life of Hugo, to find the model husband 
and father, the poet whose verses proclaimed 
the sacredness of hearth and home, running 
like any common mortal after an actress. "It 
is very seldom," writes one of them, "that 
one can find Hugo at home now ; he goes there 
only at meal time. Poor Madame Hugo ! ' ' 

The circumstance of a man's leaving his 
wife to run after an actress presents nothing 
that is novel, and but little that is interesting. 
Yet Hugo's state of mind on this occasion, so 
far from commonplace was it, is perhaps worth 
remarking. He did not adopt the cynical tone 
of a man of the world, nor can it be discov- 
ered that he ever experienced any feeling of 
remorse. To one of his friends, who uttered 
some protest or other, he replied : 

" No one understands me, not even you, Pavie. 
... I have never committed more faults than this 
year, and I have never been a better man far 
better now than in my time of innocence which 
you regret. Yes, formerly I was innocent; now 
I am indulgent. That is a great gain, God knows. 
I have beside me a dear friend, [his wife, he 
means] an angel whom you venerate as much as 
I do, who pardons me and loves me still. To love 
and to forgive that is not of Man, it is of God 
or of Woman." 

To one who is familiar with Hugo, even this is 
not novel ; but it must be allowed to be rather 
interesting. We do not recall that Rousseau, 
who was very good at this sort of intellectual 
prestidigitation, ever proved himself a better 
master of the art. And perhaps Hugo never 
revealed himself more perfectly, or ever better 
exposed the peculiar quality of the romantic 
mind, than in just this phrase: "I have 
never committed more faults than this year, 
and 1 have never 'been a better man." Hugo 
was of those who value experience rather by 
its intensity than its quality. Experience, if 
only it be of a penetrating sort, adds to the 
sum of emotional expression in the world, a 
quite sufficient justification. Now, to betray 
your wife and to be forgiven is such an expe- 
rience all the more so in case your purpose 
is to go on betraying her and to be still for- 
given: an experience which stimulates the 
sensibilities and, by multiplying these poig- 
nant memories that touch the source of tears, 
proves the presence of the good heart. Re- 
morse! There could be no question of re- 
morse, still less of cynicism. Hugo could only 



1914] 



THE DIAL 



385 



be thankful for faults which were the out- 
ward expression of an inward grace ; they but 
intensified in him, as it were, that elan vital 
which is the measure of virtue. 

Poor Madame Hugo! Yes, but poor Mile 
Drouet also. Her connection with Hugo 
lasted fifty years until the lady's death in 
1883. After she left the excitement of the 
theatre for the somewhat cloistered existence 
which Hugo provided for her, time hung 
heavy on her hands, and she complained of 
it. ' ' Write to me, ' ' said Hugo. ' ' Write me 
everything that comes into your head, every- 
thing that causes your heart to beat." And 
so she did. Day after day, for fifty years, 
she produced these notes, left in the room to 
be picked up by her lover, "scribbles," as 
she called them, twenty thousand of them 
still preserved, from which M. Gimbaud has 
selected a few as worthy to be printed. As 
letters, it can hardly be said they were worth 
printing at all. Their value is in displaying 
the behavior of Hugo's really sublime egoism 
in a relation the most intimate in the world, 
in revealing the effect of it, day by day and 
year by year, upon the woman who was bound 
to him as with wain ropes by an overmaster- 
ing and singularly enduring attachment. 

It is well known that few people found it 
possible to associate on terms of equality with 
Hugo. If he had possessed a sense of humor 
he might have defined his friends as those 
who were willing to take him at his own 
valuation. And Mile Drouet 's taking him so 
sincerely and so unreservedly at his own 
valuation was doubtless one secret of her per- 
sistent hold upon him. But even Hugo must 
soon have grown weary of a woman who 
could flatter him in no more delicate way than 
by repeatedly calling him the greatest man in 
the world ; and in fact there was, in his rela- 
tion with Mile Drouet, or in their manner of 
regarding it, something which ministered to 
his vanity in a way quite out of the ordinary. 
Their relation, from the beginning, they 
transformed, in true romantic fashion, into 
something other than it was, into a religious 
rite if you please, a sacrifice or atonement 
that was to work a kind of redemption of the 
lady's unregenerate nature. Such, at least, 
was her own understanding of the matter. 
"I see you as you are," she writes, "that is 
to say, a God-made man to redeem and rescue 
me from the infamous life to which I had so 
long been enslaved. " This is an idea to which 
we can imagine Hugo assenting without re- 
luctance, and without a smile. The role was 
one for which he was well fitted; and it had 
this singular advantage, that it enabled him 
to say at any time, and with a clear con- 



science: "I have never committed more 
faults than this year, and I have never been 
a better man." Surely, the redemption of 
one poor woman provided a treasury of good 
works upon which one could safely draw for 
indulgence to persist in very human faults. 

It would be interesting to follow in some 
detail the fortunes of this idealized concep- 
tion of their affair, to disengage, as it were, 
from the commonplace events of their lives 
the process of redemption. In the early years, 
the prospect of achieving an object so intangi- 
ble seemed slight enough. For Mile Drouet 
was no docile penitent. She was often in 
passionate revolt, protesting against Hugo's 
insane jealousy, complaining bitterly of his 
self-absorption, resenting his brutal remind- 
ers of her fallen days, mad with jealous rage 
at his betrayals. She threatens to leave him, 
often thinks on suicide, or darkly hints at 
dire misfortunes coming to pass when he is 
least prepared. But the impulse to action 
seems always spent in the frenzy of disclos- 
ing the reasons for it ; and we can well imag- 
ine the exhausted lady, whenever her lover 
crosses her threshold again, gladly sinking 
into his reconciling embrace. Her state of 
mind during these early years she has herself 
not inaptly portrayed in a graphic sentence. 
Having distinguished, apropos of nothing in 
particular, her varied ways of loving her 
' ' great little man, ' ' she says : ' ' That is why, 
my glorious Victor, at one and the same mo- 
ment I can rage, weep, crawl or stand erect: 
I bow my head and venerate you ! ' ' 

Rage, weep, crawl, or stand erect as she 
might, Mile Drouet always ended by bowing 
her head in veneration. That is the main 
point : the idea that Hugo was the God-made 
man to redeem and rescue her never lost its 
power; and curiously enough this ideal, pre- 
posterous in itself no doubt, was in a manner 
realized; a kind of spiritual regeneration did 
in fact come to pass, such is the strange power 
of ideals, even the miost unpromising. The 
poor lady learned the meaning of Faust's 
"Entbehren sollst du, sollst entbehren!" 
And we may contrast with the sentence just 
quoted words which she set down one eve- 
ning in 1853, during the exile on the island 
of Jersey, as an evidence of the transforma- 
tion that had been effected : 

" I come to tell you that I love you without 
regret for the past or fear for the future. I come 
with a smile on my lips and a blessing in my 
bosom, with my hand upon my mutilated heart 
and my eyes full of pardon, with my purity re- 
stored and my soul redeemed by twenty years of 
fidelity and love, with my delusions swept away 
and my faith shining. ... I constitute you the 
supreme arbiter of my fate. Do with me what 



386 



[ Nov. 16 



you will in this life so long as you take me with 
you in the next. I sacrifice my feelings to the 
virtue of your wife and the innocence of your 
daughter, as a homage and as a safeguard, and I 
reserve my prayers and tears for poor fallen 
women like myself." 

For restoring the purity of fallen women, 
there are more conventional ways, and bet- 
ter ones, doubtless, than that of bestowing 
twenty years of fidelity and love upon another 
woman's husband; nevertheless, in Mile 
Drouet's case, a life of devotion and service, 
winning at last the recognition of Hugo's 
family and the respect of his friends, did in- 
vest the declining days of the white-haired 
lady with a certain nobility at least, if not 
perhaps with that "majestic dignity" which 
Jules Claretie attributed to her at the time 
of her death. CARL BECKER. 



MR. HAVELOCK ELLIS OBSERVES.* 



"Follow your author," said a conserva- 
tive French editor to a neophyte, "and you 
will probably write a useful review." But 
how is one to follow a man of so versatile a 
talent as that of Mr. Havelock Ellis when he 
flits so rapidly from topic to topic that he 
gives us six score essay ettes (if the editor will 
concede the word to our sore need) in the 257 
pages of "Impressions and Comments"? Of 
course the reading of these independent 
themes will present no problem; for one sim- 
ply puts the hamper of good things on the 
table at the head of his bed, or beside his 
Morris chair, and reaches out for a bite or a 
sup, so to speak, whenever he feels inclined. 
But reviewing the volume is another matter. 
One cannot even describe these compositions 
technically. The author modestly speaks of 
them as "random leaves," and puts them 
forth as unpretentious jottings in an irregu- 
lar diary covering a period of eighteen 
months. They are not exactly pensees, al- 
though one often thinks of Joubert. They 
could hardly be defined as essays, although 
one is frequently reminded of Lamb and Haz- 
litt and Montaigne and other beloved masters 
of that literary form. Occasionally there is 
an almost disturbing intimacy of self -revela- 
tion that suggests the inimitable Pepys. And 
once or twice we even catch a note that recalls 
the arch-cynic of French literature. ("A 
sublime faith in Human Imbecility has sel- 
dom led those who cherish it astray.") As to 
the range and diversity of the subjects 
treated we may introduce the following suc- 
cessions to be found under three letters of the

ton : Houghton Mifflin Co. 



index: Browning, Bryan, Buddha, and Bur- 
gundy; Ogive, Olives, and Ovid; Vegetarian- 
ism, Velasquez, and Verlaine. 

From the foregoing it will be clear that the 
worth of these writings will depend on the 
personality of the author; and it is equally 
clear that the reviewer thinks they are valu- 
able, or he would not be burdening his readers 
with all this comment. The work of Mr. 
Ellis has been most varied. He has been a 
teacher in Australia, a medical student and 
practitioner in England, a literary critic, an 
editor of plays, a thoughtful and fruitful 
scientist, a zealous social reformer, and inci- 
dentally a lover of painting, music, sculpture, 
and travel. His publications are so well 
known that we need not enumerate them, 
although their range of diversity is not al- 
ways realized. For instance, many readers 
have enjoyed "The Soul of Spain" without 
knowing that its author has also written sev- 
eral substantial volumes on the psychology of 
sex and kindred subjects. Now, when a man 
of these varied talents and interests, having 
reached the age of fifty-three, decides to give 
the world a book of the type we failed to de- 
scribe* in our first paragraph, the reading 
public is justified in expecting a production 
that shall be a source of pleasure and profit; 
and one reviewer at least has not been dis- 
appointed. 

Naturally, as we turn the pages, we are 
constantly lighting upon the Mr. Ellis of his 
more formal writings; but the beauty of the 
present volume is that if one does not like the 
Mr. Ellis he encounters at any particular 
point, he is sure to be charmed with an alto- 
gether different Mr. Ellis just round the 
corner. However, we may probably serve our 
readers better by adducing a few examples of 
our author's impressions and comments than 
by dwelling upon our own feelings in the 
matter. 

Under the date of February 10, then, we 
find him writing on the apparently trivial 
topic of a French soprano singing for the first 
time on an English platform. He notes her 
elegant and harmonious Parisian costume, her 
finely trained voice, her dramatic but re- 
strained presentation, and her winning, gra- 
cious deportment. You will say this is all 
very ordinary. Probably it is ; but it is con- 
tinued in this strain: 

" She is a complete success with her audience. 
Yet she is really, one divines, a fairly common- 
place person. And she is not beautiful. And even 
her voice has no marvellous original quality. She 
has on her side a certain qiiality of nervous texture 
to mould artistically, but that is not a personal 
possession but merely a quality of her race. She 



1914] 



THE DIAL 



387 



has laboriously wrought this ductile nervous tissue 
to her own ends. By force of long training, dis- 
cipline, art, she has made herself what she desired 
to be. She has become all that she had in her 
to be. She has given to the world all that the world 
has any right to ask of her. 

" That is all. But this training and this dis- 
cipline, the ability to be oneself and to impart 
graciously to others the utmost that they have any 
right to demand is not that the whole Art of 
Living and the entire Code of Morality ? " 

Or if we turn to the engrossing theme of 
war, we find neither the now familiar economic 
protest of "Norman Angell" nor the old 
sentimental plea against suffering and sacri- 
fice of human life. Indeed, Mr. Ellis insists 
that it is man's feeble shrinking from death, 
with his flabby horror of pain, that marks the 
final stage of decay in any civilization. But 
he execrates war none the less for his own 
reasons. 

"Apart from the intolerable burden of arma- 
ments it imposes, and the flagrant disregard of 
justice it involves, the crushing objection to war, 
from the standpoint of Humanity and Society, is 
not that it distributes Pain and inflicts Death, but 
that it distributes and inflicts them on an absurdly 
wholesale scale and on the wrong people. So that 
it is awry to all the ends of reasonable civilization. 
Occasionally, no doubt, it may kill off the people 
who ought to be killed, but that is only by accident, 
for by its very organization it is more likely to 
kill the people who ought not to be killed. 
Occasionally and incidentally, also, it may promote 
Heroism, but its heroes merely exterminate each 
other for the benefit of people who are not heroes." 

In contrast to the foregoing we may intro- 
duce three passages treating of the nude. On 
October 4, as Mr. Ellis was lying with a book 
on the rocks by the seashore, he saw in the far 
distance a dim feminine figure walk down the 
beach and plunge into the waves. The inci- 
dent results in this reflection : 

" In an age when savagery has passed and civili- 
zation has not arrived, it is only by stealth, at rare 
moments, that the human form may emerge from 
the prison house of its garments, it is only from 
afar that the radiance of its beauty if beauty 
is still left to it may faintly flash before us. 

"Among pseudo-Christian barbarians, as Heine 
described them, the Olympian deities still wander 
homelessly, scarce emerging from beneath obscure 
disguises, and half ashamed of their own divinity." 

In a similar spirit he describes the dancing of 
Bianca Stella : 

"As she danced, when I noted the spectators, I 
could see here and there a gleam in the eyes of 
coarse faces, though there was no slightest move- 
ment or gesture or look of the dancer to evoke it. 
For these men Bianca Stella had danced in vain, 
for it remains symbolically true only the pure 
in heart can see God. To see Bianca Stella truly 
was to realize that it is not desire but a sacred 



awe which nakedness inspires, an intoxication of 
the spirit rather than of the senses, no flame of 
lust but rather a purifying and exalting fire. To 
feel otherwise has merely been the unhappy priv- 
ilege of men intoxicated by the stifling and un- 
wholesome air of modern artificiality." 

Less convincing but equally illustrative of 
our volume is the passage about a young Ger- 
man danseuse who has been arrested by the 
Parisian police on a charge of outrage aux 
mceurs for appearing naked on the stage. To 
a journalist the lady expresses her indigna- 
tion at this insult to her art: 

" ' Let there be no mistake ; when I remove my 
chemise to come on the stage it is in order to bare 
my soul.' Not quite a wise thing to say to a 
journalist, but it is in effect what the suffragette 
also says, and is rewarded with rotten tomatoes as 
her sister with a proces-verbal." 

It is hard to resist the temptation to take 
up other topics, particularly music, flowers, 
literature, travel, and progress; but we may 
not trespass further on the kindness of our 
readers. 

We have spoken of the volume lightly as a 
hamper, and we may continue the figure by 
saying that inevitably different palates will 
be differently affected. All who partake may 
find toothsome and wholesome morsels; but 
many will make a wry face at certain mouth- 
fuls and call for more orthodox fare. As for 
your reviewer, it need hardly be said that he 
finds a pleasant flavor on his gustatory nerves, 
as of something agreeable, helpful, and stimu- 
lating, albeit occasionally acrid and disturb- 
ing. His hand will return many times to the 
hamper. p. B. R. HELDEMS. 



Aisr INTIMATE VIEW OF TOLSTOI.* 



It is with a painful sense of the futility 
seemingly inherent in even the best endeavors 
after human good that one reads by the lurid 
glare of the European holocaust an intimate 
revelation of the great spirit of Tolstoi, de- 
voted through so many years to the advocacy 
of Christian conduct between men and na- 
tions, and so loyal to peace and brotherhood. 
Are the Tolstois and the Ruskins of the race 
mere players in a comedy staged by ironic 
gods, and does each lapse into silence only to 
leave the stage free for another vain and 
futile performer to play his fruitless role? 
Surely Tolstoi would have died of a broken 
heart had he lived till the middle of the year 
1914. We must needs reassure ourselves by 
reflecting that the outward and obvious event 
of the day does not always betoken the inward

spirit of the times. The influence of such 
persons as Tolstoi is pervasive and permeat- 
ing, and we cannot cry aloud of this influ- 
ence, any more than of the Kingdom of 
Heaven, "Lo, here!" or, "Lo, there!" for 
the influence is within us. The world's hor- 
ror at its own hideous blunder in this war is 
a measure of the coming of that influence, and 
we may still hope for the victory of reason 
and religion after this frenzy shall have spent 
itself. For the time being, however, Tolstoi's 
words have a sad realization : " ... the chief 
thing I have been trying so hard to say all 
my life, the thing I believe in, the most im- 
portant of all, they will forget." 

But let us forget instead, for the moment, the 
gruesome details of the daily slaughter of our 
fellowmen, and seek a more intimate compre- 
hension of the spirit of Tolstoi, so remote, but 
so fixed, like a star over the battlefield. The 
reminiscences, by his son, Count Ilya Tolstoi, 
will help us to such a comprehension. It will 
require a composite of many views to make a 
true portrait of so great a personality as Tol- 
stoi, and this must be done by another gen- 
eration. With the lapse of time what was the 
outgrowth of very temporary Russian condi- 
tions will be permitted to fall away, what was 
excessive zeal to balance a keen consciousness 
of excessive youthful follies will be allowed 
for, and the character of the great Eussian 
will become world property like the character 
of Goethe. We may well be grateful for all 
added material for such a judgment, and 
especially for material so fresh and authentic 
as is furnished by the son. 

It is natural that the portion of the memoirs 
dealing with the childhood of the writer 
should be the most valuable. No other biog- 
rapher could give us so intimate a view of 
the home life of Tolstoi in his middle years. 
The son, writing with keen satisfaction of his 
early memories, has succeeded in becoming a 
child again, and the figure of the father in 
his pages is commanding and fascinating: 

" He hardly ever punished us, but when he 
looked me in the eyes, he knew everything that I 
thought, and I was frightened. . . . He knew all 
our secrets, too. When we played at houses un- 
der the lilac-bushes, we had three great secrets, 
which nobody knew but Seryosha, Tanya, and me. 
All of a sudden up came papa one day, and said 
that he knew all our three secrets and they all 
began with a B, which was perfectly true." 

" My father always responded to her [his 
sister-in-law's] outbursts of plain speaking, pro- 
voked by little household unpleasantnesses, with 
jovial good humor and playfulness, and would at 
last bring her round, so that she would first give 
a rather sulky smile and then melt altogether and 
join in his laugh." 



It is not remarkable, but very pleasant, to 
read of the great author's keeping the chil- 
dren in good humor in rainy weather by play- 
ing with them "Numidian cavalry," a game 
of his own invention, of his snatching Ilya's 
plate before he could eat his last pancake 
(but later restoring it), of his teasing the 
Countess by using the jelly served at dinner 
to paste together boxes for the youngsters, of 
his drinking by purposeful mistake the glass 
of kvass just poured for his neighbor at 
table, and then profusely apologizing. 

Some of the scenes are not thus agreeable. 
The enthusiastic teacher who later organized 
schools for the peasants always began his 
son's mathematics lesson with pleasantries, 
but lost his temper during the course of the 
hour. The great writer wrote a miserable 
scrawl, and then corrected and scratched and 
interlined till no human eyes could read the 
copy. If the Countess, after superhuman loy- 
alty and patience in her labor as a copyist, 
resorted to him for the reading of such a pas- 
sage, he usually began by evidencing impa- 
tience at her dullness and concluded by recom- 
posing what could not be deciphered ! On the 
whole, nevertheless, one comes to feel that 
even before his religious awakening, Tolstoi 
was probably more pleasant than most 
geniuses. After an outburst of impatience 
with a friend, he would frankly and affec- 
tionately apologize. When he had quarreled 
with Tourguenieff, and the latter, after a long 
absence, visited Yasnaya Polyana, Tolstoi 
was minutely painstaking to avoid offensive 
discussion. When Tourguenieff shot a wood- 
cock at dusk and Tolstoi's dog failed to re- 
trieve the game, the children were secretly 
instructed to run out early in the morning 
and look for the bird in order to give a pleas- 
ant close to the incident. One gets a satisfac- 
tory clue to some of the current stories of 
ruptures with friends in such evidence of 
high temper and tender-heartedness. 

Extremely valuable material is contained in 
this volume for those interested primarily in 
Tolstoi's religious and economic opinions, and 
the genesis and development of these opinions 
becomes very natural as we observe the actual 
process. However extreme certain of his 
views may be reckoned by the deliberate ver- 
dict of posterity, however thwarted in the 
struggle for free development by the highly 
artificial environment of aristocratic life in 
Tolstoi's Russia, their spontaneousness and 
naturalness in the midst of such conditions 
cannot be questioned. When we see Tolstoi 
going out to mow the hay of some widow or 
with tools to thatch the hut of a helpless vil- 
lager, such acts do not bear the stamp of 



1914] 



THE DIAL

quixotism, but appear rather the natural ex- 
pression of a profoundly earnest man reacting 
upon an unhappy environment. If that en- 
vironment was mistaken by Tolstoi for the 
universal condition of human society, and his 
teaching thus took on a tone of sombreness 
and became at times particularistic, these 
qualities were only the inevitable result of an 
intense desire to be genuine and actual rather 
than vague and theoretical. Certainly there 
is something painful in considering the long 
struggle after light, and the minute conscien- 
tiousness in following this light when one con- 
trasts these stages of Tolstoi's life with the 
exuberance of spirit evidenced by the younger 
man in the circle of his family when he sang 
to his children such classic verses as the fol- 
lowing : 

Die angenehme Winterzeit 

Is ferry nice indeet! 

Beiweilen wird's ein wenig kalt, 

Doch Himmel, stamp your feet! 

Auch wenn Man doch nach Hause kommt, 

Da steht der Punch bereit: 

1st es nicht ferry nice indeet 

In der kalten Winterzeit? 

But whatever lack of balance, sanity, and 
serenity one may feel in the later Tolstoi is 
to be attributed to Russian conditions and not 
to the nature of the man himself. Ruskin, we 
must recall, became actually unbalanced. 

In searching for the inner essence of the 
personality of Tolstoi, the account given in 
these reminiscences of the relationship of the 
father toward his son, the author, and the 
latter 's fiancee before and after their mar- 
riage is of the greatest value. One is tempted 
to quote from the remarkable letter in which 
he sets forth the purpose of marriage, but a 
brief excerpt would fail to represent this 
touching and profound counsel of a great 
believer in the things of the spirit to a young 
man about to enter upon that relationship 
which so searchingly tests the quality of the 
spirit. How far away we feel, as we read this 
letter from the camp of the Russian army! 
And how far away seems that future when 
humanity shall have mastered the brute in- 
heritance with which it has struggled these 
thousands of years, and Tolstois will reach 
their spiritual birth without the terrible 
travail through which this one came: when 
God shall have returned to himself.

A CRITIC OF DEMOCRACY.* 

"As for the American republic, it is a constitu- 
tional monarchy and nothing else. With his large 
powers in foreign relations, and in domestic affairs 
with his ministers who are not responsible to con- 
gress, with his right, which he uses, of initiating 
legislation, with his right, which he also uses, of 
appointing all the functionaries of the state, the 
president of the American republic is a sovereign. 
He is one so much the more in that if his min- 
isters are not responsible to congress, neither is he, 
since he was chosen not by congress but by the 
people. At bottom and in all reality the presi- 
dent of the American republic is a very powerful 
constitutional monarch, who need consider nothing 
but the public interest and need take pains about 
nothing but public opinion to be popular, to be 
reflected, and where he has been once reflected 
and cannot be again, to be honored in his country. 
He is a sovereign pro tempore, but a sovereign. 
An ambassador from France to the United States 
said to me, ' The president of the American republic 
is incomparably more a king than the king of 
Great Britain, and more an emperor than the 
emperor of Germany.' There has never been and 
there is not in the world to-day a pure democracy, 
unless it be the French democracy." 

This passage indicates the degree of interest 
for readers this side of the sea contained in 
M. Emile Faguet's criticisms of the French 
democracy. ''The Dread of Responsibility," 
like "The Cult of Incompetence," which 
appeared several years ago, is a genially and 
elegantly written (and elegantly translated) 
arraignment of the French commonwealth for 
its impersonality, its irresponsibility, and its 
incompetence. 

In the first chapter, which deals with legal 
ideas and customs, the courts are charged with 
being controlled by the government in all 
cases in which the latter is interested, and 
consequently with being irresponsible. The 
present is unfavorably contrasted with the 
old regime, where the office of judge was pur- 
chased, as are still the offices of solicitor and 
notary. A return to this, however, is not 
advocated. M. Faguet would abolish the jury, 
and give the Court of Cassation power to 
appoint all judges, and lodge in the bench the 
power of electing the Court. In the second, 
"The Professions," he discusses the French- 
man's fondness for easy, even though not 
very remunerative, employment under the 
government, with the irresponsibility it 
brings. All occupations, even those called 
liberal, are rapidly becoming nationalized in 
the passion for officialdom. In the third chap- 
ter, "In the Family," the author declares 
that the dread of responsibility is again mani- 
fest in the diminution of the birth rate among

the French. This, with the increase of Ger- 
mans, Italians, and Jews, is causing the 
enfeeblement of patriotism. In the fourth, 
"In Political Customs," he again contrasts 
the present regime with the old, and says, 

" We have so constitutionally limited the respon- 
sibility of power as to make it practically nil. . . . 
A real constitution has replaced the legal consti- 
tution, and so completely that no one would dare 
to violate the real constitution in order to apply 
the legal, and that to act constitutionally would 
appear shamelessly unconstitutional. And this 
real constitution is contained in one word: the 
president of the French republic is a cipher. Or 
in another word, there is no president of the 
French republic. This is so true that a statesman 
who is elected president of the republic feels sim- 
ply that his political career is ended." 

M. Faguet's solution is not a return to 
monarchy, because France has really been a 
republic for eighty years now, and "it is 
essentially traditionalist to be a republican." 
"It is a question of making a republic that 
will work, and that, like all republics that 
have lived, will be a republic with a demo- 
cratic base and containing an aristocratic ele- 
ment. " There always exists an aristocratic 
element: the judiciary, for example, or the 
body of barristers, or the body of army offi- 
cers. ' ' The aristocratic element in a nation is 
all that part which has enough of vitality and 
of cohesive force and of sense of responsibility 
to form a group, an association, an assemblage 
of parts, an organism, to become a living 
thing, that is to say, a collective person. ' ' The 
problem is to make it responsible and opera- 
tive. 

M. Faguet hardly expects to see the desired 
change, or at least not until democracy in 
France shall have run its course. He declares 
his agreement with Professor Barrett Wen- 
dell : ' ' The nature of the Frenchman is to be 
radical, to be ideologistic, to pursue his ideas 
to the very end, to have no fear but quite the 
contrary in considering whither his ideas will 
lead him. ' ' He concludes with an exhortation, 
"For Each One of Us," to bring the French 
character to the same high level with the 
French mind. "The French mind is of the 
first order." The deficiency in character is 
* ' the cause of all the trouble. ' '

NOTES ON NEW NOVELS. 



Mr. Charles McEvoy's " Private Affairs " 
(Hough ton) is an agreeable surprise. It begins 
with a simple naturalism to tell the story of mid- 
dle-class folk, a single family, in which the com- 
monplace father is the ruler of his household, 
though he is more under the domination of his 



wife than he supposes. It moves slowly at first, 
but the figures correspond so closely to actuality 
that one soon finds oneself engrossed. Presently 
the youngest of the family develops talent as an 
actress. At seventeen she becomes the leading 
lady at the chief London theatre and her parents 
find themselves in possession of more money than 
they had ever expected to control. A progressive 
atrophy of the finer moral sense sets in, affecting 
everybody but the actress daughter, who meets her 
fate through the sheer ignorance in which her 
mother had chosen to rear her. She falls in love 
with a man whom she learns is married only at 
the very close of the tale. From the simplicity of 
straightened circumstances and remoteness from 
metropolitan life, the argument proceeds through 
greater and more marked complications until it 
closes in a cluster of situations, involving every 
member of the family but one, so entangled that 
the delighted reader can almost imagine another 
story for its unravelling. The humor of the story, 
which is genuine, lies wholly between the lines; 
and there, too, will be found social satire of an 
unusual sort. 

What lack of sentiment and, it may be added, 
lack of humor will do for a public career that 
bids fair to be remarkably useful and successful is 
set forth in "The Blind Spot" (Harper) by 
Mr. Justus Miles Forman. The protagonist of 
the book, a reformer, is contrasted with a young 
man of promise who has been spoiled by money. 
The man of the world learns much from the re- 
former, who, shaping his thoughts strictly accord- 
ing to " common sense," is quite unable to learn 
anything from him. Presently the positions of 
the two automatically reverse themselves, the pro- 
tagonist's lack of feeling running him into colli- 
sion with the community's actual common sense, 
which he suddenly learns has also the meaning of 
common sensibility. There is a love story with a 
rather foregone conclusion holding the narrative 
together. The book is a good one, and it narrowly 
escapes being much better. 

Someone with that marked aptitude for odious- 
ness which marks comparisons, calls Mr. Bruno 
Lessing " the Kipling of the Ghetto." He is noth- 
ing of the sort; two writers more in contrast can 
hardly be found in the range of current fiction. 
In theme and treatment Mr. Lessing's " With the 
Best Intention" (Hearst's) recalls Mr. Zangwill's 
early tales of the sclinorrer in London, the chief 
difference being due to the scene. The stories are 
short, only one small group being linked by any- 
thing more than the personality of the lovable, but 
not very much loved, Jewish scamp who moves 
throiigh them. But, as with most picaresque tales, 
there is an abundance of humor, and some of the 
situations are certain to provoke laughter, though 
not to arouse sympathy. 

Melodrama is always capable of exciting inter- 
est, with or without profit. Consequently Mr. 
John Oxenham's " Maid of the Mist " (Lane) will 
be found worthy of passing an hour or two with, 
and that not without profit. The earlier chapters 
are merely a means to get the hero on the sea and 
quite thoroughly shipwrecked. With one other

survivor he comes ashore at Sable Island, in the 
north Atlantic, at a point where many a tall ship 
had gone to her doom. The other survivor is half 
Scotch reaver, half Spanish buccaneer. The 
wrecked ships furnish life, until presently there is 
driven ashore a beautiful girl. The hero comes 
into her good graces, the villain dies as a result of 
rum, and presently the two marry one another 
a vastly more sensible arrangement than is usually 
allowed to prevail in such cases. 

In reading Miss Marie Van Vorst's " Big Tre- 
maine" (Little. Brown & Co.) one has the feeling 
of having come upon it before. Its elements are an 
accused and deeply wronged brother, who returns 
to his old Virginia home after having amassed 
millions; he restores the family estates, rejects 
the advances of the girl who had scorned him for 
his guilty brother, and finds his fate in a younger 
and more charming person whose father he en- 
riches. One touch of originality closes the book: 
to crown him with the final palms of triumph he 
is nominated to Congress! It is romance, of an 
ordinary sort, with types rather than persons for 
characters. 

Sword-and-cloak romance has been outside of 
the purview of contemporary fiction for so long 
that "Ashes of Vengeance : A Romance of Old 
France" (McBride, Nast & Co.), by Miss H. B. 
Sbmerville, has a pleasant and reminiscent flavor, 
a little of Scott, more than a touch of Dumas, and 
the general air of an older and more gallant day. 
It opens with the massacre of St. Bartholomew. 
A Huguenot lover and his affianced bride are 
saved from death by the ancient enemy of the 
family, who exacts what he supposes to be an 
enduring vengeance. The affianced one fades away 
so quickly that one wonders of the need for her at 
all, and the enemies become reconciled through the 
newer love that befalls the Huguenot hero and his 
foe's beloved sister. 

Mrs. Gertrude Pahlow in "The Gilded Chry- 
salis" (Duffield) labors under the disadvantage of 
having chosen for her protagonist such a fool of 
a girl that most of her book passes in the defence 
of her (in the reader's mind) from the charge of 
congenital idiocy; it is safe to say that no mere 
man could ever have thought out a female char- 
acter so steeped in improbable folly. This young 
person marries a man of character and achieve- 
ment, professor of science in a flourishing college. 
She proceeds to alienate his friends, squander his 
property, involve herself in a preposterous scandal 
with an undergraduate, and, having ruined his 
future with a positively German thoroughness, to 
run away. Eventually she learns to wash dishes, 
and returns to show him her new accomplishment. 
His delight is enormous, proving that he is almost 
as much of a featherhead as she. 

Light in manner to the verge of flippancy, Miss 
Sara Jeannette Duncan (Mrs. Everard Coates) 
writes " His Royal Happiness " (Appleton) in the 
interests of an Anglo-American alliance. She suc- 
ceeds at the close in having a treaty to that end 
passed by the Senate, whereupon it develops that, 
to make it more binding, the King of England has 
taken to wife the daughter of the President of the 



United States. The book is addressed to young 
women of the lackadaisical age, if there are any 
left, and abounds in slang, which Mrs. Coates's life 
in America has enabled her to reproduce accu- 
rately. 

It takes either a brave man or a secluded one to 
write against the equal rights of woman in these 
days. Mr. William Jasper Nicholls is the man, 
and " Wild Mustard " (Lippincott) is the writing. 
Those who favor woman suffrage in the book are 
ill-tempered and unseemly to the eye; those who 
do not are gracious and fair to view. One man 
stands out for it, and he is arrested for stealing 
his host's overcoat, being apparently guilty also of 
bigamy. After a brief experiment, the lovely 
young heroine, in whose mind sprang the weed 
(wild mustard) of equal rights, reforms and 
comes home to marry a perfectly sweet young man 
and try to be as good a woman as her mother was 
before her. 

" The Gaunt Gray Wolf: A Tale of Adventure 
with ' Ungava Bob ' " (Revell) is one of those 
books of Labrador that Mr. Dillon Wallace knows 
so well how to write, abounding in scenes of strug- 
gle against the forces of nature in their bitterest 
form and shot through from cover to cover with 
a faith in things above and beyond ourselves. The 
chief characters are two of those whom God helps 
because they help themselves, one a rich young 
Boston college man, the other a brave and hardy 
son of the North. The book is one of real adven- 
ture, set down with knowledge and sympathy. 

No one writes more genial genre stories than 
Mr. W. W. Jacobs, and the latest volume of them, 
"Night Watches" (Scribner), is no exception to 
its predecessors. The night-watchman plays his 
humorous part, and several others are introduced 
for variety and good measure. One of the best of 
the stories has a laughable ghost or two in it, and 
there is a contrast in the form of a real ghost 
story which will make very creepy reading indeed 
late at night. 

BRIEFS off NEW BOOKS. 



Six con 
men of 



Dr. Edwin E. Slosson, the 
literary editor of "The Inde- 
pendent," has reissued in book- 
form six essays under the title of "Major 
Prophets of To-day" (Little, Brown & Co.), 
which first appeared in substantially their 
present form in the columns of his periodi- 
cal. The list selected includes the names of 
Maeterlinck, Bergson, Poincare, Ostwald, and 
Haeckel. Among the prophets originally dis- 
cussed were also Bernard Shaw, Chesterton, 
H. G. Wells, and John Dewey, but these latter 
have apparently not been deemed worthy of 
the first rank, or perhaps they merely await 
the publication of a companion volume. Dr. 
Slosson is by training a natural scientist but 
has somehow strayed into the paths of literary 
criticism. The scientific habit of mind, he 
keeps assuring us, is wholly compatible with

a love of art and even with a feeling for mys- 
ticism, which is only religion verified by the 
experimental method. He believes that the 
true aim of all knowledge will eventually be 
recognized to be prevision, just as that is now 
the avowed aim of science. This point of 
view naturally leads to a disparagement of 
the value of history and indeed of all other 
studies which turn men's eyes backward 
rather than forward. The author is appar- 
ently untroubled by the fear that a culture 
which is not deeply rooted in the past may 
readily prove to be superficial, flatulent, and 
cocksure. Be that as it may, Dr. Slosson has 
popularized in a very readable manner the 
views of certain of the foremost thinkers of the 
day. He has a gift for lucid exposition and 
the faculty of making his theme appear vital 
and human. Each essay is accompanied by 
bibliographical instructions to the novice on 
the way he should approach the author in 
question. Portraits of the six "prophets" 
and accounts of a visit to the home of each 
serve to lend the book a more vivid appeal. 
The chapters on Maeterlinck, Bergson, and 
Ostwald are the most interesting. It would 
have been well if the chapter devoted to Pro- 
fessor Haeckel had been placed before the one 
on Professor Ostwald in such a way as to show 
how the now discredited materialistic mon- 
ism of the former has given place to the more 
acceptable energy-monism of the latter. The 
essay on M. Bergson furnishes a temptingly 
easy approach to a philosopher who is much 
harder to understand than he is generally re- 
puted to be. His philosophy is described as a 
constructive system based on pragmatic criti- 
cism. It is to be noted also that it is M. 
Poincare's pragmatism which attracts the 
writer's sympathy. According to Dr. Slos- 
son, time and personality are for M. Bergson 
immediate data of our consciousness. The 
freedom of the will, which is involved in the 
very essence of personality, is likewise intui- 
tively felt. Art, then, is invaluable because 
it gives us a more direct vision of reality and 
strengthens the faculty of intuition, which our 
rationalistic modes of thought have tended to 
obscure. It is interesting to learn the fact 
that M. Bergson in one of his lectures in New 
York replied affirmatively to the question 
whether he believed in immortality or not. It 
may be inferred from various tokens that his 
next great work will deal more directly with 
the problems of religion. Dr. Slosson finds 
M. Maeterlinck to be less an original thinker 
than an exquisitely sensitive personality who 
is able to catch the dominant notes of the time 
in which he lives and give them artistic ex- 



pression. The gifted Belgian is a believer in 
science and democracy ; he is an optimist who 
has a rich dower of faith, though in whom or 
what it would be difficult to say. No attempt 
is made to balance the essays against the plays 
or to determine relative literary values. 

A conspicuous illustration of 
A handbook of the widespread need for a work

handbook for the study of the continental

with its properly descriptive sub- title "Out- 
lines for Its Study," by Mr. Barrett H. Clark. 
In his Preface the author promises to follow 
this volume with one to be entitled "British 
and American Drama of To-day: Outlines 
for Its Study." The volume already pub- 
lished deals with Ibsen, Bjb'rnson, Strindberg, 
Tolstoi, Gorki, Tchekoff, Andreyeff, Haupt- 
mann, Sudermann, Wedekind, Schnitzler, 
Von Hofmannsthal, Becque, Maeterlinck, Eos- 
tand, Brieux, Hervieu, Giacosa, Donnay, 
Lemaitre, Lavedan, D'Annunzio, Echegaray, 
and Galdos. The book opens with a chapter 
of exposition awkwardly entitled "What Con- 
stitutes a Play." This is obviously written 
for the uninitiated reader; and while clear 
enough, is marked by the lack of the note of 
self-reliance a lack which vitiates so much 
of American criticism. A brief sketch, a few 
pages in length, in two parts first biograph- 
ical, then critical heads the chapter on each 
individual dramatist. This is followed by a 
chronologically arranged list of plays, giving 
both date of publication and date of produc- 
tion (presumably first production, though the 
place of production, unfortunately, is not 
given only the year). The list is followed 
by a bibliography of such plays of the drama- 
tist in question as have been translated into 
English to which is appended a list of ref- 
erences to the most important books and maga- 
zine articles dealing with the dramatist and 
his plays. The chapter closes with an outline 
for the study of one or more of the plays of 
the dramatist treated, only those plays which 
have been translated into English being in- 
cluded in the outline. For example, under 
Gorki, there is an outline for only one play, 
"The Lower Depths," while under Ibsen 
there are outlines for six plays: "The Pre- 
tenders," "Brand," "Peer Gynt," "A Doll's 
House," "Hedda Gabler," "The Master 
Builder." The outline usually gives a brief 
but suggestive summary of the play, followed 
by a number of subjects proposed for inquiry, 
investigation, and study. These outlines are, 
of necessity, fragmentary; yet if conscien-

tiously followed by the interested reader or 
student, they should leave him -with a clear 
and well-reasoned conception of the play, its 
purport, art, and technic. The bibliographical 
lists and references are sufficiently full and 
accurate, in general ; but there are a number 
of singular and conspicuous omissions. Yet 
this is a useful book which Mr. Clark has put 
together with great patience, care, and indus- 
try. It will prove valuable to the student as 
a brief reference-bibliography; to the club 
member who is following a course in the mod- 
ern drama it will prove invaluable. One 
cannot restrain a sense of mild amusement, 
from time to time, however, over the little 
sketches of the dramatists especially those 
obviously manufactured from secondary 
sources. 



An ingenuous Mr. Richard Curie is evidently 
study of possessed of one of the primary 

Mr. Joseph r - i_ . 

Conrad's novels, qualifications tor writing about 
Mr. Joseph Conrad an enthusiasm for the 
subject. It is unfortunate that he has none 
of the others. His book is an amusing per- 
sonal document rather than a contribution to 
criticism. He has a predilection for an- 
nouncing his intentions, as if he believed them 
to be extraordinary. Occasionally he is mod- 
est, as when, at the beginning of Chapter II. 
he says : 

" In this chapter I mean to give, first of all, in 
a perfectly concise and colourless form, the salient 
facts of Conrad's life up to the time of his leaving 
the sea, and then I mean to examine in a more 
literary and romantic sense his two books of recol- 
lections, ( Some Reminiscences ' and ' The Mirror 
of the Sea.' And I hope to throw some light on 
the autobiographical basis of many of Conrad's 
stories. But I would like to say, straight off, that 
this chapter will not be of much value to the critic 
for, like the one that follows it, it is informative 
rather than critical. That stands to reason." 

It must be admitted that the chapter is of no 
more value to the critic than he promises it 
will be. Mr. Curie 's attempts to identify Mr. 
Conrad's artistic achievement are apparently 
informed by wide reading but they are floun- 
dering ones, just the same : 

" In my opinion realists are the only true artists 
in fiction. And I do not mean the realism of a 
Zola which is coarseness or the realism of a Dick- 
ens which is caricature I mean, essentially, the 
realism of a writer like Turgenev or Conrad, the 
realism, in fact, of typical and distinguished re- 
ality. Anthony Trollope, it is true, is a realist, but 
he has obviously a second-rate intelligence and 
therefore his creations are wanting in the highest 
actuality. They are not imagined with the pas- 
sionate nuances of real life." 

It is as impossible to answer such a paragraph 



as it is to take it seriously. Later on in his 
book, Mr. Curie returns to the matter : 

" If one looks closely into it one sees, I think, 
that the Continental tradition (I mean the tradi- 
tion started by Stendhal, continued by Balzac, and 
developed by Flaubert and the Russians) is not 
really a way of approaching the novelist's art so 
much as the way. It is getting down to the bed- 
rock of imaginative life and surely there is noth- 
ing beyond that." 

But he is unable satisfactorily to explain why 
he thinks Mr. Conrad is carrying on the tradi- 
tion initiated by Stendhal. It is too bad. 
Mr. Conrad is a serious artist. We should 
welcome an account of his art that told us 
something. Doubtless Mr. Conrad would wel- 
come it. But he can hardly relish being told, 
either directly or by implication, that he 
"has not the corrupt simplicity of a George 
Moore," that most of his few readers quite 
misunderstand him, and that he represents 
the only true reaction to the "poisonous" lit- 
erature of the eighteen-nineties (Doubleday, 
Page & Co.) 

An enthusiastic Miss Kate Stephens, whose list 
admirer of of publications already includes 

Greek civilization. AmeY[can Thumb _p rints " and 

"Delphic Kansas," now harks back to her 
interest in Greek literature and archaeology, 
in a volume entitled "The Greek Spirit: 
Phases of Its Progression in Religion, Polity, 
Philosophy, and Art" (Sturgis & Walton). 
The author has very excellent intentions, and 
honestly tries to let mankind from Kansas to 
New York survey the latest notions about 
-^gean civilization, for the betterment of 
American culture. Unfortunately, in one 
way and another she comes into competition 
with dangerous rivals, such as Zielinski in 
' ' Our Debt to Antiquity, ' ' Butcher in ' ' Some 
Aspects of the Greek Genius," Gildersleeve 
in "Hellas and Hesperia," and Livingstone 
(if we dare mention him in the same sentence 
with Gildersleeve) in "The Greek Genius and 
Its Meaning to Us. ' ' If the unpleasant truth 
must be told, in this competition Miss Ste- 
phens fares ill, partly because Livingstone, 
Gildersleeve, Butcher, and Zielinski write 
with coherence. Their subjects and predi- 
cates do not generally play hide-and-seek with 
the reader as in this: "Cereals grew in sun- 
lit tillage, the grape sacred through its use in 
the religions of many peoples, the gray-green 
olive, other esculent fruits, and horned cattle 
grazed in meadows dotted by benefactive for- 
est trees." We find an American thumb- 
print in the use of "humans" in the sense of 
men and women, and an unhyphened, half- 
German locution in the ugly words, "their

art gift." There are interesting passages in 
the volume, but on the whole it must be de- 
scribed as chaotic. 



Mr. George Ives has written a 

Sr* bitter book in " A History of 
Penal Methods : Criminals, 
Witches, Lunatics ' ' ( Stokes ) . His account of 
the organized, systematized, and legal inven- 
tions of revenge which have assumed the name 
of justice down to our own times is a tragic 
story. When we have read how learned 
judges, acute lawyers, gowned bishops, sedate 
scholars, have gravely worked out these dia- 
bolical torments, we are in a better position 
to understand why, after a half century of 
peace and civilization, Europe is now sud- 
denly transformed into "a wilderness of 
fierce wolves." The contrast between the 
finest culture of England in the nineteenth 
century and its treatment of working people 
and prisoners is amazing, almost incredible; 
it reminds one of the vineyards and flower 
gardens on the slopes of smoking Vesuvius. 
At least this much is made clear by Mr. Ives 's 
almost tedious compilation of resurrected hor- 
rors: that hate never made men kind, that 
revenge under the respectable name of justice 
never made the wicked good, that force and 
repression have no power to make men free 
and competent citizens. Mr. Ives has done 
well to ask for educational treatment, for 
mercy, forgiveness, brotherly help, probation, 
parole, reformatory process. The one dark 
spot in his book (and one wholly contradictory 
to his general tendency) is his recommenda- 
tion that confirmed criminals, after several 
convictions, should be put to death. He says 
"painless death"; but there is no form of 
capital punishment which does not brutalize 
the public and divert attention and effort 
from rational means of reformation. 



Mr. J. E. Crawford Flitch's 
"An Idler in Spain" (McBride, 
Nast & Co.) is the record of a 
Goya pilgrimage to Barcelona, Saragossa, 
Madrid, Toledo, and one or two small towns, 
by an Englishman who loves the more human 
phases of literature, painting, and travel, and 
writes of them in a sincere and unconventional, 
genial and attractive, though at times some- 
what garrulous, page. "Goya and Spanish 
Character" is a title which would better 
describe the book, for it is not mere art 
criticism, and Goya is only one of two chief 
interests, each of which illuminates the other. 
The second half of the work far exceeds the 
first in compactness and substantiality. From 
Chapter IX., on "The Portraits," both inter- 



ests are intensified. Those unacquainted with 
Goya will be interested in the comment on the 
life and character of ever-fascinating Spain 
Spain, ' ' which will always remain an un- 
discovered country, for the reason that there 
are few who have the intrepidity of spirit 
necessary to discover it." An address at the 
beginning to Don Miguel de Unamuno, and 
frequent references to his opinions, add to the 
interest of the book for those who have a per- 
sonal or literary acquaintance with the bril- 
liant Rector of the University of Salamanca. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The opinions of Dr. William D. H. Brown, the 
author of " Good Health and Long Life," are con- 
servative. He leans decidedly to the side of cau- 
tion in such matters as diet, baths, and tobacco. 
His statement of the case is invariably one to be 
easily understood by the lay person. The volume 
is published by the author. 

Mr. William S. Walsh has compiled a useful 
book in " Heroes and Heroines of Fiction : Mod- 
ern Prose and Poetry " (Lippincott) . The sub- 
title promises " famous characters and famous 
names in novels, romances, poems, and dramas 
classified, analyzed and criticized, with supplemen- 
tary citations from the best authorities." The text 
fulfils this promise in the main, although the list is 
not, of course, complete. 

Professor Allen Porterfield's " Outline of Ger- 
man Romanticism" (Ginn & Co.) is marked by 
an enthusiasm unconventional in a text-book. He 
has written it as if he enjoyed the task, "for the 
benefit of advanced students and those who teach 
advanced students." So much spirit is pleasant to 
discover, and all the more so when it seems to 
have contributed to, rather than detracted from, 
the book's usefulness as a compilation of facts. 

Not immediately connected with the European 
war, but with obvious bearing upon it, is " War's 
Aftermath" (Houghton), by Messrs. David Starr 
Jordan and Harvey E. Jordan. It is an attempt 
to form some measure of the effects on the south- 
ern states of the Union of the reversed selection 
due to the loss of life in the Civil War. It con- 
sists of replies to a questionnaire sent to men of 
various stations, and is accordingly a compilation 
of opinions rather than a scientific study. Its con- 
clusion is that the war " seriously impoverished 
this country of its best human values." 

"A Guide to Gothic Architecture," by Mr. T. 
Francis Bumpus (Dodd, Mead & Co.), is primarily 
for the Englishman with an architectural hobby, 
and the number of others to whom it will appeal is 
limited. In spite of the general scope of its title, 
its main thread is the development of mediaeval art 
in England, and buildings in other countries are 
brought in only for comparison. In the numerous 
half-tones continental architecture fares better 
than in the text. The author of " The Cathedrals

of England" writes loosely, for a popular audi- 
ence still swayed by Ruskinian prejudices and 
undisturbed by the progress of research. 

The "Fireside Edition" of Mr. William T. 
Hornaday's work, " The New American Natural 
History" (Scribner), is in four amply illustrated 
volumes. There are sixteen plates in color besides 
many reproductions of drawings and photographs 
and numerous charts and maps. Mr. Hornaday 
felt in 1904, when the original edition was pub- 
lished, that " the time was ripe for the publication 
of a work which, while scientifically accurate, 
would ... be read through for entertainment 
before being placed on the shelf for reference." 
The result was a well-written book, especially 
adapted to the young student, as well as to the 
amateur. 

A sort of book impossible only a few years ago, 
but now becoming familiar, is entitled "Life and 
Law: The Development and Exercise of the Sex 
Function, together with a Study of the Effect of 
Certain Natural and Human Laws, and a Con- 
sideration of the Hygiene of Sex" (Putnam), by 
Miss Maude Glasgow, M.D. It is intended for 
grown folk, but will serve as a basis for informa- 
tion to be given the young. Dr. Glasgow is an 
uncompromising believer in the feminine almost 
to the extent of looking upon mere maleness as a 
necessary evil, brought late into the universe to 
supplement the female. This leads to a statement 
as rash as this : " The superior morality of woman 
is undisputed." The superior morality of one sex 
or the other does not exist. It is evident how the 
result is reached by the writer, for there is a ten- 
dency from one cover of the book to the other to 
regard the good in man as due to woman, and the 
evil in woman as due to man. This, it need hardly 
be stated, is no more true than that woman's supe- 
rior morality is undisputed. But the book has its 
value notwithstanding this bit of pharisaism. 

Sixth in the series of little books known as 
" Constable's Modern Biographies," published in 
this country by Houghton Mifflin Co., appears an 
intimate account of " Dr. Barnardo as I Knew 
Him," by Miss A. R. Neuman, one of his secre- 
taries and helpers. It is now nine years since the 
death of the benevolent founder of the well-known 
and numerous homes for destitute children, and 
seven years since the issue of his biography by 
his widow and Mr. J. Marchant. Miss Neuman's 
smaller work presents the man in his daily activi- 
ties and familiar conversation with his associates 
a most lovable character and an untiring toiler 
for the waifs of London and of England gener- 
ally, of whom more than sixty thousand were 
cared for by his organization in his lifetime in no 
fewer than sixty-five homes, including the Cana- 
dian branches. In her outline of Dr. Barnardo's 
life Miss Neuman gives him one more year than 
the short span actually allowed him, but corrects 
the error in an appended " Chronological Sum- 
mary." Nowhere in her book, curiously enough, 
do we find her hero's name given in full, Thomas 
John Barnardo, though the index supplies his 
initials.

HOLIDAY ISSUES FOR 1914 



THE HOLIDAY PUBLICATIONS OF 1914 will be re- 
viewed in the two numbers of THE DIAL appearing December 
1 and 16. Both issues will be especially planned to interest 
Holiday buyers, and serve them as a guide in making their 
purchases; and both will be exceptionally choice mediums for 
Holiday Advertising, a considerable extra edition being sent 
out to a very carefully selected list of Holiday buyers. 

The Issue for December 16 will be distributed promptly, so as 
to be in the hands of its readers a full week before Christmas the 
week when retail buying is at its height and this number will be 
of hardly less importance than that of December I. 

*** Advertisers are especially requested to send their orders 
and copy promptly, for their own interests as well as ours. If 
space is desired in both issues, notice to that effect in advance 
will be appreciated.

The British Empire and the

A REVIEW OF THEIR RELATIONS DURING THE CENTURY OF 
PEACE FOLLOWING THE TREATY OF GHENT. 

By WILLIAM ARCHIBALD DUNNING. With an introduction 
by the RIGHT HONORABLE VISCOUNT BRYCE and a preface 
by NICHOLAS MURRAY BUTLER. 

This is the psychological moment for the appearance of a book 
which explains the century of peace between Great Britain and 
the United States. When nearly every world power except the 
United States is at war, the history of our relations with a coun- 
try, one of whose dominions borders ours for a distance of 3,000 
miles, cannot help being intensely interesting and helpful to an 
understanding of war and peace and their underlying causes.

The Man Behind the Bars 

By WINIFRED LOUISE TAYLOR. 

Miss Taylor has for many years devoted her life to the study

the lives of convicts, the effects of prison life, the careers of men 
who have served their terms, and the prospects and sources of 
their reform. 1.50 net; postage extra. 



The Amateur Garden 

By GEORGE W. CABLE. 

Mr. Cable not only knows how to plan and make attractive 
small gardens but he also has the faculty of telling about it in a 
way which is entertaining and highly effective in its practical 
suggestion. There is nothing of the elaborate, formal garden 
which must be cared for by a corps of employees and built by 
a landscape expert. The gardens here described are only those 
which the owner himself can plan, make, and manage. 
$1.50 net; postage extra. 



Outlines of International Law 

By CHARLES H. STOCKTON. 

A book on international law from Admiral Stockton's pen 
is especially timely since a number of works previously pub- 
lished upon the subject have become out of date, especially in 
the body of the text, by the changes that have occurred, partly

A Great Peace Maker 

The Diary of James Gallatin in Europe 

FROM THE AMERICAN 'PEACE THROUGH THE DOWNFALL OF 

NAPOLEON AND THE FOLLOWING YEARS. 
This journal of the son and secretary 9f Albert Gallatin, 
who accompanied his father during the negotiation of the Treaty 
of Ghent and afterward during his ministries to France, 1815-26, 
and to England, 1826-7, is one of the most entertaining and 
enlightening commentaries on that period ever written. Its 
historical importance, as being the work of a young man whose 
chance to observe and comprehend great historical events was 
unique, is obviously great. But the casual reader will be 
charmed rather by the candid, sharp, and fresh observations upon 
great men and women, and events in France and England at the 
end of the Napoleonic era, made by this American youth.

A TALE OF THE MISSISSIPPI. 
By GEORGE W. CABLE

of the big river steamers, immortalized 
from another point of view by Mark 
Twain; a love story with a heroine 
who is the embodiment of Southern

the most picturesque period of our 
history. 

"Mr. Cable now proves that for one

picture of the Old South the material

a beautiful mellowness. ' ' N. Y. Tribune.

A story of high honor upheld in the 
face of danger, in sacrifice of happiness 
but with the ultimate reward of love. 

A story of a brilliant campaign in 
Nicaragua and a victory by American 
soldiers. 

"Mr. Paine has made a substantial 
and attractive monument to the Marine 
Corps in his narrative of peace at the 
Falmouth Navy Yard, and his stirring 
account of their adventures in Nica- 
ragua, which looks much like a bit of 
recent experience in Mexico. . . . The 
story is written in Mr. Paine's custom- 
ary virile style, and it will be no less 
appreciated by all good Anericans than 
by the marines, who are given a new 
glorification." Boston Transcript.

THE ADVENTURES OF A SUPERFLUOUS 
HUSBAND. 

By EDWARD C. VENABLE 

A story of the sham of divorce. 
Here is one of the most powerful novels 
of contemporary society. It throws 
the light of truth on the fatuity of un- 
necessary divorce, and is at once a 
brilliant satire and an incontrovertible 
condemnation of a growing evil of our 
day. It is a masterpiece of subtlety, 
cleverness and vivid unexpectedness of 
style. $1.00 net; postage extra. 

The City of 
Numbered Days 

By FRANCIS LYNDE 

A story of tense situations and in- 
genious denouements. A prosperous 
city springs up in the shadow of a great 
dam which is being built by the United 
States Reclamation Service. As soon 
as the dam is completed the valley 
will be flooded and the city destroyed. 
In such a setting there are endless 
opportunities for mad speculation, cor- 
rupt politics and the sudden making 
and breaking of fortunes. Mr. Lynde 
has used all of these to the best ad- 
vantage, besides introducing a number 
of compelling personalities and a strong 
love story. 

"A tale of thwarted schemes, specu- 
lations gone awry, and devotion to duty 
in the face of temptation strong and 
alluring, presents a vivid and dramatic 
picture of conditions still coexistent 
with our new and raw civilization."

Wild Life Conservation 

in Theory and 

Practice 

By WILLIAM T. HORNADAY, Director 
of the New York Zoological Park. 

This book contains the story back of 
Dr. Hornaday's other books, as "Camp- 
Fires in the Canadian Rockies." Like 
all his work, literary or executive, it il- 
lustrates his profound knowledge of an- 
imals and his warm love for them an 
affection which, without wasting itself 
in sentimentality, has spurred him to an 
active campaign for the preservation of 
birds and beasts. An interesting feature 
of the book is a chapter on private game 
preserves by Frederic C. Walcott, owner 
of a successful reserve in Norfolk, Conn.

The Song of Roland 

Translated into Metrical Verse by 
LEONARD BACON, Instructor in English 
at the University of California. 

The spirit of the times when 
"For seven years together, the 

Emperor Charlemagne, 
Our Lord and King, had sojourned 

within the land of Spain. 
From thejupland to the sea-coast 

he had conquered all the land, 
Nor was there any castle before 

him left to stand," 

is well caught in this new rendering of 
the old chanson de geste. Mr. Bacon's 
manuscript is considered remarkable by 
those best fitted to judge its merits, not 
alone because of his accurate translation 
of the old French, but also because of 
his preservation of the poetry and 
charm of the original work.

nishes the clearest exposition we have 
seen of food values and their relation to

THE HOLIDAY BOOK MUSTER. 



Military terms and martial imagery have 
ousted the nomenclature and the metaphors of 
peace. Therefore it is not unnatural at this 
time to view the annual procession of holiday 
publications as an army on its way to the 
front to the bookshop where, as on the 
firing line in battle, it faces the risk of defeat 
as well as the prospect of victory. But the 
defeat is never a total rout, nor is the victory 
ever unclouded by partial failure. Certain 
parts of the formation, occasional units in the 
brave array, encounter disaster or achieve 
success, as the case may be, and with the com- 
ing of another season the lines are reformed 
and the battle goes on as before. A few of the 
wounded may recover and return to the front, 
perhaps in even better fighting condition than 
before, but most of those that fall in the first 
charge go down never to rise again. Instances 
like the now acknowledged masterpiece of 
Edward FitzGerald, which for a long time lay 
disregarded among the refuse marked down in 
desperation to a penny by the undiscerning 
dealer in literary odds and ends, and was at 
last rescued from oblivion only by what might 
seem a lucky accident, are so rare as to enjoy 
a quite peculiar fame of their own. 

"What constitutes a holiday book, it would 
be hard to define precisely, and the term is 
here used loosely to cover the general literary 
harvest of the closing year. But, not to ex- 
change military for agricultural phraseology, 
not to beat prematurely our swords into 
ploughshares and our spears into pruning- 
hooks, let us continue for a brief moment to 
review the ranks and files of this array of the 
season's books as a martial host equipped for 
conflict. The soldiers of the first line what 
in military language is called the active army 
engage our most interested attention. A 
good account of themselves is sure to be ren- 
dered by these trained and disciplined fight- 
ers. M. Maeterlinck, for instance, as repre- 
sented by his new book, and Mr. Crothers in 
his timely reflections on Votes for Women, 
and Mr. H. G. "Wells in his latest novel, and 
Mr. Masefield in his volume of poems, with 
half a hundred others that might be named,

THE DIAL, 



[Dec. 1 



may be relied upon to acquit themselves cred- 
itably. But they will not lack the support of 
the reserves and the younger recruits, of the 
Landwehr and the Landsturm, and there will 
be no gap in the battle front that is not speed- 
ily filled up from the rear. 

Among the veterans who might have been 
thought to have earned their honorable retire- 
ment, but who are now recalled to service by 
the exigencies of the hour, one may note Mr. 
Norman Angell Lane's well-known work, 
"The Great Illusion," revised and supple- 
mented, and the late Emil Reich's "Ger- 
many's Swelled Head," also brought up to 
date, and Mr. Arthur Bullard's "Panama," 
enlarged, and also the usual number of re- 
printed and re-illustrated favorites in ro- 
mance and poetry, history and biography and 
travel. The new recruits necessarily include 
some, perhaps many, who are destined to 
receive grievous wounds and to lie moaning 
in pain on the battlefield, somewhat as the 
sixteen-year-old boys now forced to the front 
in eastern Germany are found in pitiful 
plight by the advancing Russians and are 
heard to admit that this is their first expe- 
rience in handling a rifle, their first participa- 
tion in military manoeuvres. And a few 
rather decrepit old soldiers, gallantly striving 
to hide their infirmities, are detected by a 
sharp eye as the forces continue their march. 

Some of the devices adopted, by those 
skilled in such things, to give an appearance 
of newness and unimpaired serviceability to 
what might otherwise fail to pass muster, are 
more interesting to the philosophical observer 
than highly creditable to their authors. For 
example, and with a shifting of imagery from 
the army to the navy, a dummy funnel of 
painted canvas, like that which enabled the 
late unlamented ' ' Emden ' ' to deceive her foes 
and strew the seas with wrecked merchant- 
men, is often rigged up on an ancient craft to 
make it pass for a new battleship of latest 
equipment. A special preface, of little or no 
value in itself, is provided for a half -forgotten 
book on which the copyright may have ex- 
pired, or which may never have been copy- 
righted in this country, and on the strength of 
this trifling addition copyright in the current 
year is obtained (for the preface alone, of 
course, though no explanation to that effect is 
printed), and the heedless purchaser imagines 
he has secured a new work of literature. Or, 
with greater audacity, a classic may be re- 



issued under a new title and passed off as a 
book of the season. Four years ago an enter- 
prising publisher thus brought out Miss Mit- 
ford's "Our Village" with a transmogrified 
title-page even the author's name, whether 
by accident or design, being slightly changed 
and with a lavish addition of unrelated pic- 
torial matter that doubtless helped to palm the 
volume off upon the inexperienced as a fresh 
and eminently desirable literary creation. 
The imperfect fitting of a stock of miscella- 
neous pictures to almost any old book capable 
of illustration is a time-honored and some- 
times commercially successful device of the 
expert holiday-book-manufacturer. Another 
very simple and often deceptive expedient of 
the wide-awake publisher is the omission of 
the date at the foot of an author's preface 
when it is desired to give an air of youth to 
a book no longer in its infancy; and if the 
work is presented in new typography and 
with other modern details, the result is not 
seldom gratifying in more ways than one. 
This present season witnesses, for instance, the 
resuscitation of two works (Mr. Percy Fitz- 
gerald's "Book Fancier" and Andrew Lang's 
"Oxford") that deserve to succeed on their 
unaided merits, though they originally ap- 
peared twenty-eight and twenty-four years 
ago, respectively. Now, in all the pride of 
new print and the luxury of ample margins, 
and in one case with new illustrations, and 
also, in both instances, with discreet avoidance 
of any hint as to their having lost the bloom 
of youth, they take their places confidently 
and imposingly among the publications of the 
current year. At least one reviewer has al- 
ready discussed Mr. Fitzgerald's excellent 
book as if it were a new production. But if 
there be any imposition in the matter, the pub- 
lishers might well enough plead that it is in 
a good cause. If deserving old books will not 
be bought and read for their own sakes and 
in their undisguised oldness, let them be out- 
wardly rejuvenated and made to win fresh 
triumphs by virtue of their rejuvenation. 

The war machine must in all its parts be 
up-to-date, and a little ahead of date if possi- 
ble, to win the victory; and so the army of 
books must each year have new uniforms and 
the most modern of equipment if it is to con- 
quer the great public's inborn reluctance to 
be separated from its money. Or, at any rate, 
such is the prevailing impression among those 
versed in such recondite matters.

GERMAN CULTURE. 



Slights and insults rankle worse than in- 
juries. For any people to put on airs of 
superiority to their neighbors is to evoke a 
vindictive spirit. The South, at the beginning 
of the Civil War, called the Northerners 
* ' mud-sills ' ' and ' ' barbarians, ' ' and an- 
nounced the purpose of imposing its own 
civilization upon them. There has been a 
similar exhibition of self-satisfaction and 
vain-glory among the Germans of late. It has 
been a sudden explosion, for ordinarily the 
Germans have been the most modest of people. 
Shakespeare has been their national poet. 
They have welcomed and naturalized Cal- 
deron and Moliere and Milton and Dante. It 
is hardly too much to say that a good half of 
German literature consists of commentaries on 
foreign literature and art. Goethe, speaking 
of Moliere, said : * ' It is well for us little men 
to stand humbly in the presence of the mas- 
ters. " And he rebuked those who tried to 
raise up Tieck as a rival to himself, by saying 
that it was as absurd as if he should try to 
equal himself with Shakespeare, who was an 
immeasurably greater power. But now the 
Germans are crying themselves up as superior 
to everybody else. 

We confess to a weakness for Germany, be- 
cause of the cult of genius which has, inter- 
mittently, prevailed in that country for nearly 
two hundred years. It began with Frederick 
the Great 's experiment with Voltaire, was con- 
tinued by the Weimar Court through two gen- 
erations of poets and musicians, and was 
practised in one way or another by various 
other courts and states. Finally, perhaps a, 
day after the fair, it was taken up by the great 
Philistine people themselves. An attempt has 
really been made for efficiency, an effort to 
get every one in his right place and to recog- 
nize and reward talent. That this attempt has 
come off, has been successful, seems doubtful. 
Heine was an exile and his works were pro- 
scribed. Wagner was an exile, and was kept 
in extreme poverty for twenty years while he 
was doing his great work. Schopenhauer and 
Nietzsche were utterly neglected in their life- 
times, though their pupils and imitators have 
been loaded with honors. The best of the mod- 
ern German artists have had a hard struggle, 
while popular favor and the patronage of 
the great went to their inferior rivals. In 
Germany, as elsewhere, fortune has usually 
turned genius from the door while she has 
ushered the great, pre-eminent dunces to the 
feast. 

If it were merely a question of contempo- 
rary German culture, we should be disposed 



instantly to reject their claims to superiority. 
Their literature, the literature of Hauptmann 
and Sudermann and Wedekind, seems to us 
enormously inferior to the work of their classic 
epoch. It is a muddle of rather sickly ideal- 
ism and naturalism of the most pernicious 
sort. The imaginative reason does not shine 
through it so clearly as through the contem- 
porary work in England and France. In 
music we believe the Germans have allowed 
themselves at last to be distanced by the com- 
posers of other countries. In art we may call 
up as a witness the great critic of modern 
painting, Herr Meier-Graefe. He is a German 
and, if the newspaper report of his recent 
utterances be correct, a prejudiced and im- 
placable one. In the chapters of his work on 
modern art devoted to Germany, he labors 
faithfully to set forth the claims of recent 
German artists, but the impression he gives is 
that he considers them meritorious and re- 
spectable. He certainly does not write of 
them with the enthusiasm and whole-hearted 
praise he bestows on Constable and Delacroix 
and Manet and Cezanne. In civics, owing to 
intelligent state action and supervision, Ger- 
many has undoubtedly achieved success. All 
observers admit that the ordinary affairs of 
life are better ordered there than anywhere 
else. Whether or not, in order to get such 
results, other races would submit to such drill 
and discipline may be questioned. A good 
many people object to be vaccinated for small- 
pox, and we imagine the mass of mankind will 
refuse to be inoculated for civic comfort and 
welfare. 

But when we come to the culture of the 
Germanic peoples in the past, there is enough 
to give us pause in our rejection of their 
claims. This inquiry is matter for a volume, 
not for a slight essay, and no one man's 
knowledge would suffice. We can only give 
what seems to be the general opinion of the 
world, eked out by our own hazardous guesses. 

The first thing to decide is: Who are the 
Teutons? We suppose that Holland and the 
Low Countries generally would have to be 
yoked with the present German Empire and 
Austria as generically and historically related. 
The second question would be: What is cul- 
ture ? Without prejudice to other human 
activities we will take architecture, art, music, 
literature, philosophy, science, manners, and 
war as covering what is usually . accounted 
culture. 

If Gothic architecture could be attributed 
to the Teutons, they would stand side by side 
with the Greeks in this important field. But 
the credit must be shared with the Byzantines, 
the French, the Spanish, and the English; 



442 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1 



so that they have no superiority here. Giving 
to the Teutons the art of the Low Countries, 
which we feel is a stretch of generosity, they 
stand out equal to the Italians and superior 
to all other modern peoples. A good many 
critics believe Rembrandt the greatest painter 
of the world. In music it is hardly worth 
while to register rivals or seconds the Teu- 
tons are supreme. 

There is very little German creative litera- 
ture which is greatly original and still less 
which has the classic perfection that can defy 
time. In the drama and the novel it has al- 
ways followed foreign fashions. How much of 
German poetry is absolutely first rate? The 
first part of Faust and a quantity of ballads 
and lyrics perhaps. Even this much hardly 
has that stamp of style which is common in 
Greek, Latin, Italian, and English poetry. 
There is probably more of the ultimate per- 
fections of poetry in the forty lines of ' ' Kubla 
Khan" than in the entire extant body of 
German verse. Goethe knew very well that 
distinction was the one thing that German 
literature lacked, and he strove all his life to 
attain it. But either something in the lan- 
guage or a deep strain of homeliness in the 
Germanic nature, was against him. The first 
great monument of German poetry, the 
' ' Nibelungenlied, " is perhaps typical of what 
the race can do in this field. It is in a 
way the most tremendous picture of human 
life ever unrolled. But it is clumsy in de- 
sign and pedestrian and garrulous in execu- 
tion. It borrowed much from the Norse 
sagas, but it did not borrow their brevity and 
brilliance. All this is not to say that German 
poetry is lacking in great and lasting quali- 
ties. It is rich in thought, full of music, and 
more pregnant with emotion and sentiment 
than the poetry of any other race. Its very 
homespun quality has been its fortune in the 
modern world which has grown impatient of 
silks and satins and cloth of gold. In all the 
lines of criticism, however, it is superior to 
any other. French criticism, which is usually 
set up against it, is mostly a kind of glorified 
gossip. 

German philosophy ranks with that of the 
Greeks and Hindus. It is perhaps not so 
original as either of these others. Kant was 
deeply indebted to Hume; his successors, 
Schelling, Fichte, and Hegel, pillaged the pre- 
Socratic Greek thinkers; and Schopenhauer, 
Nietzsche, and Eucken went back to the 
Asiatics. However, there is no more consid- 
erable or important body of thought in any 
modern language. 

When it comes to the question of science, pure 
and applied, we are tempted to say to all the 



contending rivals : ' ' You are all Hidalgo 's. ' ' 
It would be a hard matter to decide between 
Germany with Kepler, Copernicus, and Gut- 
enberg; Italy with Galileo, Galvani, and 
Columbus; France with an almost intermin- 
able band of astronomers and physicists ; and 
England with Bacon, Newton, Darwin, and 
Watts. If the balance inclines at all, we 
should say it was in the favor of England. 

The manners of a people are a delicate sub- 
ject to criticize. Every nation has its own 
ideal. Every nation, however, has openly or 
covertly admitted that the French are polite. 
If this gallant and charming people have a 
rival in manners, it is in the more stately 
and serious Spanish. The Germans have a 
homely kindliness of nature, and, for aught 
we know, individuals among them may pos- 
sess all the fineness and polish of the Arab 
or Parisian. This grand style does not come 
out in their literature or biographies. The 
great Goethe alternated his love letters to 
Charlotte von Stein by sending her presents 
of cabbage-soup. And the recent philosophy 
dominant in Germany certainly would seem 
to crush out the very elements of politeness. 
There is no Fontenoy business, "The French 
never fire first," about it. Whatever Niet- 
zsche's philosophy may be in the point of 
morals and for our part we think it merely 
carries to a logical extreme the doctrines and 
discoveries of Carlyle and Darwin however 
it may show in morals, it is horribly disas- 
trous to manners. " The Will to Power " is 
the absolute antithesis to noblesse oblige. 
Probably hog wallowing is the way to succeed 
in life, but the nobler spirits of mankind will 
always prefer to be beaten with Don Quixote 
rather than arrive at the Governorship of an 
Island with Sancho Panza. 

Lastly, in war there are only three great 
superdreadnaughts of glory Alexander, 
Caesar, and Napoleon. Hannibal and Charle- 
magne may perhaps be yoked with these. 
Germany with her Barbarossa, Wallenstein, 
Frederick the Great, and Moltke certainly does 
not outrank England with Alfred, Cromwell, 
Marlborough, Nelson, and Wellington. 

To sum up, if all the various forms of cul- 
ture can be ranked as equal, then the Teutons 
may be credited with a greater assortment 
of gifts for mankind than any other people 
except the Greeks or the Italians, ancient and 
modern. But there have been a good many 
of them, and their per capita of the products 
of culture is probably far less than the French 
or English. And the different forms of cul- 
ture cannot be considered equal. Opinions 
will differ, of course, as to the value of the 
different arts and activities of mankind. But 



1914] 



THE DIAL, 



443 



there is a pretty general consensus that lit- 
erature, and especially poetry, is the fine, con- 
summate flower of mortal effort. In poetry, the 
Germans are babes in swaddling clothes be- 
side the full-grown English. In war and 
manners they must yield to the French. In 
music alone are they so superior as to be able 
to say ' ' Here is our throne, let all men bow to 
it." It does not seem to us, therefore, that 
their culture is so overwhelmingly superior to 
any single European State that they should 
seek to impose it by force of arms upon the 
whole world. As if culture could be imposed 
by force ! CHARLES LEONARD MOORE. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



INSULTS TO THE READER'S INTELLIGENCE, in 
the form of unnecessary elucidation, super- 
fluous instruction, excessive elaboration, dem- 
onstration of the self-evident, expatiation on 
the commonplace, or any like manner of 
weariness, are resented by the mentally alert. 
As prone as any others to commit this error 
of underrating the reader's intelligence are 
the didactic and the homiletic writers; and 
among didactic writers the authors of arti- 
cles and handbooks on the administration and 
use of libraries are not the least of sinners. 
There have recently been published in this 
department of literature three useful books 
wherein a reader not maliciously critical 
might conceivably find passages likely to 
arouse the resentment above referred to. For 
example, in a handy little manual on "The 
Practical Use of Books and Libraries," by 
Mr. Gilbert O. Ward of the Cleveland Public 
Library, a book intended for "young per- 
sons such as high school students and library 
apprentices," the author thinks it necessary 
to explain that "a dictionary is an alpha- 
betical list of the words of a language with 
their derivations and meanings." On an- 
other page he says: "To use an index, look 
for the name of what is wanted in its alpha- 
betical place as in a dictionary or in a tele- 
phone directory." Elsewhere he explains 
that ' ' the TITLE of a book usually gives a hint 
of the book 's contents. ' ' Mr. Ward 's treatise 
is now in its second and revised and enlarged 
edition, and is published by the Boston Book 
Co. The second of these carefully planned 
works is entitled "Books and Libraries: 
Their Makers and Their Use, ' ' and it is writ- 
ten by Mr. Charles Phillips Chipman, libra- 
rian of Colby College, and published by the 
Colby Alumnus Press. Opening at the elev- 
enth chapter, one is informed that ' ' a periodi- 
cal is defined as 'a magazine or other publica- 



tion which appears at stated or regular inter- 
vals. ' The term is not applied to books which 
are published in parts or sections. ' ' Near the 
end of the book a hortatory paragraph bids 
us, if we would "make the acquaintance of 
the greatest minds the world has ever known, 
learn to read, cultivate the reading habit, and, 
whatever else you may do, READ." Perhaps 
wise advice like this cannot be too often re- 
peated. The third of the books under con- 
sideration is the initial number of a series to 
be known as "Classics of American Libra- 
rianship," edited by Dr. Arthur E. Bostwick 
of the St. Louis Public Library, and pub- 
lished by the H. W. Wilson Co. The volume 
in hand is on "The Relationship between the 
Library and the Public Schools," a favorite 
and well-worn theme among educators and 
librarians. From the numerous papers of 
various authorship that the book contains we 
have space only for the following sound 
maxim: "The children's room should not be 
planned for student use only, since it should 
meet the needs of the child as a child, as well 
as of the child as a student. ' ' We defy any- 
one to controvert this. 



THE MOST LIMITED EDITION POSSIBLE is, 

manifestly, the edition restricted to a single 
copy. Such editions are extremely rare, but 
not unknown. For example, Babbage, of cal- 
culating-machine fame, was responsible for 
the issue of a certain remarkable work in 
twenty-one volumes, each of which was lit- 
erally unique. But before proceeding further 
let us recall a story that illustrates the pecul- 
iarities of the man and indicates the bent of 
his genius. Accustomed to wear a nightcap in 
sleeping, he once found himself away from 
home without this article of apparel and 
facing the prospect of both sleeplessness and a 
cold in the head. Reasoning, however, that 
the imagination is potent in its influence over 
the bodily senses, he searched his pockets for 
a piece of string, which he tied over his head 
and under his chin in such wise as to give 
much the same feeling as if he had donned his 
customary head-gear. As a result he slept well 
and suffered no ill effects from the substitu- 
tion. Characteristic, therefore, of his fond- 
ness for experiment and of his keen attention 
to the little things of daily life that collec- 
tively go to make up some of its big things, 
was his series of studies in the effect on the 
reader's eye of different-colored papers and 
inks in the making of books. In order to 
ascertain exactly what combination of colors 
or shades would produce the least fatigue, he 
caused portions of the tables of logarithms to 
be printed in many colors on paper of many

[Dec. 1 



colors. This work, Babbage's "Specimens of 
Logarithmic Tables," in twenty-one volumes 
octavo, London, 1831, was limited to one copy ; 
but who finally became its owner cannot here 
be stated. It must have rivalled Joseph's 
coat of many colors in its polychromatic ap- 
pearance. Sterne's "Tristram Shandy" has, 
at pages 169, 170, of volume one, two pieces 
of marbled paper pasted where the printed 
matter would regularly have its place. ' ' Mot- 
ley emblem of my work, ' ' satirically says the 
author of this device. But it was nothing to 
Babbage's motley assortment of paper and 
printers' ink in the aforementioned work. 
One hundred and fifty-one colors and shades 
were represented in the paper used, and the 
printing was in light and dark blue, light and 
dark green, light and dark red, olive, yellow, 
purple, and black; also, in the last volume 
there was printing in gold, silver, and copper, 
on vellum as well as on paper of different 
colors. As this is the year in which tri-cen- 
tennial honors are being paid to Napier, the 
inventor of logarithms, the foregoing may not 
be altogether unseasonable. 



M. PIERRE Lori's IMPRESSIONS OF THE WAR, 
as published in the Paris journal, "L 'Illustra- 
tion, "contain more of poetry than of grim 
reality ; and yet the scenes that met his eye in 
a little village of northern France were all 
real enough, the poetic charm lying in his 
interpretation of them. The October sun shone 
with a kindly warmth that reminded one of 
Provence, while from a distance came the 
hoarse roar of artillery like the mutterings of 
a gathering storm. "In the neighboring fields 
peasants were working as if nothing out of the 
ordinary had been going on, doubtful however 
whether the savages who made so much noise 
over yonder might not come back one of these 
days and lay waste everything. Here and 
there on the greensward, clustered about little 
fagot fires, were groups of people who would 
have seemed pitiable under a sunless sky, but 
whom the sun managed to make cheerful- 
even those refugees in flight before the bar- 
barians, cooking their food as gypsies do, 
among the bundles of their poor clothes, 
packed in haste when the frantic flight for 
safety set in. ... When we entered the vil- 
lage the sun was shining with increasing 
brightness. There was a confusion, a jumble, 
the like of which man had never seen and 
never will see again after this war, unique in 
history. All the uniforms were there, all the 
arms of the service, the Scots, the French 
cuirassiers, the Turcos, the Zouaves, and the 
Bedouins who give their military salute by 
raising their hooded cloaks with a stately 



gesture. The church square was filled with 
enormous English busses which in other times 
had given communication facilities to Lon- 
don, and still bore in huge letters the names 
of certain quarters of that city. It will be 
said that I exaggerate, but truly they had an 
air of astonishment, these busses, at rolling 
over French soil and being filled with French 
soldiers." Splendidly determined to see the 
soul of goodness in things evil, Loti thus char- 
acteristically concludes: "What good people 
still live in the world ! And how the aggres- 
sion of the German savages has strengthened 
the sweet, gentle bonds of fraternity among 

all those who are truly of the human species ! ' ' 



THE UNDISMAYED BOOK-COLLECTOR rides his 
hobby (he is lucky to have anything to ride 
in these days when all ridable horses have been 
commandeered or otherwise appropriated for 
military use) and delights in the acquisition 
of a rare Elzevir or Aldine just as if the fate 
of nations were not hanging in the balance. 
But, after all, what good would it do for the 
non-militant world to suspend its customary 
activities, shocking though it may at first seem 
to find pleasure in anything when so many 
thousands of one's fellow-beings are subjected 
to unspeakable sufferings? The hammer of 
the book-auctioneer still continues to knock 
down the coveted volume to the delighted high- 
est bidder. In London the house of Hodgson 
& Co. started a successful book-sale toward the 
end of October, and greater things in the same 
branch of trade are in prospect for the new 
year. Some one has recalled the interesting 
fact that this same firm of Hodgson & Co., or, 
rather, its founder, had the courage, a century 
ago, on the very eve of the battle of Waterloo, 
to announce the sale of " A Miscellaneous Col- 
lection of Old and New Books in good pres- 
ervation, ' ' which were to be " sold by Auction 
by Mr. Saunders at his Great Boom (The 
Poet's Gallery), No. 39, Fleet Street, on Fri- 
day, June 16th, 1815, and Nine following days 
(Sundaj r s excepted) at 12 o'clock each Day." 
If the great battle had not chanced to fall on 
a Sunday, the peaceful purchase of "old and 
new books in good preservation" would have 
gone on while cannon were thundering on the 
now historic plain beyond the Dover Straits. 



CONCERNING "AMERICA," the national an- 
them (as it is also, in its music, the British 
national anthem, while, to go a little further, 
it is likewise the air of a German patriotic 
song), certain facts of interest are just now 
to be noted. The original manuscript of the 
verses, "My country, 'tis of thee," com- 
posed in a spare half-hour at Andover Theo-

logical Seminary by Samuel Francis Smith in 
1832, has recently been given to the Har- 
vard University Library by the author's 
surviving children; and Librarian Lane, in 
acknowledging the gift, has promised that 
when the new building is occupied the pre- 
cious relic shall be "made accessible for vis- 
itors to see." A little before this interesting 
occurrence (the presentation) there chanced 
to be revived, in connection with Baltimore's 
"Star Spangled Banner" celebration, the 
question of the authorship of the music of 
"America"; but the settlement of that an- 
cient dispute remains as remote as before. 
Whether Dr. Henry Carey, as his partisans 
maintain, wrote the familiar British song and 
supplied it with a tune in the year 1740, or 
whether, as a certain fitness of things makes 
one wish to believe, Dr. John Bull rendered 
this service to his countrymen on the occasion 
of the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot (to 
which the line, "Frustrate their knavish 
tricks," is said especially to allude), the 
world may never know. Luckily there will 
never be any question as to the origin of the 
lines whose author had his praises so mem- 
orably sung by one of ' ' the boys ' ' at the thir- 
tieth anniversary supper of his college class, 
the famous Harvard '29, 

"And there's a nice youngster of excellent pith,- 
Fate tried to conceal him by naming him Smith; 
But he shouted a song for the brave and the 

free, 
Just read on his medal, ' My country, of thee ! ' " 



AN ORTHOGRAPHIC PUZZLE confronts the 
spelling-reformers in the now daily and 
hourly used word corps. The "Simplified 
Spelling Bulletin" devotes more than a page 
to discussing the anomalies and ambiguities 
for which this unsimplifiable French word 
has been responsible. "But we must say core 
and spel it corps," says the writer, though 
""the normal English spelling of corps is in 
fact core, or, if one so pronounces it, cor." 
Apparently the "Bulletin" shrinks from the 
responsibility of advocating a phonetic spell- 
ing of the word; even in its pages the "army 
core" would cut a rather queer figure. In 
this connection one is reminded of another 
military term that may some day give a little 
trouble to the reformers, if it has not already 
done so. Lieutenant can hardly be said to 
offer a perfect example of phonetic spelling 
even to an American, far less to an English- 
man, who customarily pronounces the word, 
leftenant. The American and the English 
simplifiers ought to get together and agree on 
an international spelling and pronunciation 
of this very common word. And while they 



are about it, they might also fix upon an inter- 
national accent of still another military term, 
subaltern, which is emphasized on the penult 
in this country and on the antepenult in 
England. When the war is over and the 
things that military language stands for cease 
to be of an importance so vastly superior to 
that of the language itself, perhaps the world 
will have leisure to amuse itself with such 

questions as these. 



BOOK-HUNGER IN THE IRON RANGE OP MIN- 
NESOTA evinces itself in the eager use that the 
Iron Rangers make of any new public library 
that opens to them its literary treasures. 
From the mining town of Chisholm there 
comes, through the columns of the "Library 
News and Notes" of the Minnesota Public 
Library Commission, this item of cheering 
intelligence: "It would do Mary Antin's 
heart good if she could visit the libraries on 
the Iron Range and see the use which the 
immigrants are making of these splendid in- 
stitutions. In the six weeks from the opening 
of the library, May 15th to the end of June, 
935 children and 504 adults were registered, 
and 5609 volumes were circulated. During 
July 164 additional registrations were made, 
and the circulation was 3336 volumes. Spe- 
cial days in the week are assigned to the 
children from various locations, in order to 
distribute the work evenly. The children may 
exchange books any day, but there is music 
for them on these special days, and a story 
hour. There are victrola concerts every Sun- 
day afternoon, in which the music of many 
nations is used. Sometimes selections from 
an opera are given, and the story of the opera 
is told. ' ' These frequent reports of the immi- 
grant children's enthusiastic and intelligent 
use of their library privileges in "the prom- 
ised land" make a native reader almost 
ashamed of the comparative lack of ardor in 
this respect on the part of some of our young 
people of good old American stock. 



PREJUDICES OF JUVENILE READERS make 
themselves known in more or less amusing 
ways to every children's librarian with ears 
to hear the freely offered comments of the 
young book-borrowers. For example, in the 
juvenile department of the St. Louis Public 
Library the following dialogue, as recorded

borrower. ' ' Why, Joe ? What has hap- 
pened? " "Nothin'," was the reply, while 
the attendant fingered the book cards in the 
tray before her. "Your book is due to-day, 
but you have an hour's time before the library 
closes. Why don't you go home and get it?"

sisted the attendant. " 'Cause," continued 
Joe, "I'll get a bath if I do." Though not

"A JOURNAL OF OPINION" appears as the 
sub-title on the opening page of the new 
weekly periodical just started in New York 
under the editorship of Mr. Herbert Croly 
and an able staff of young writers, and with 
the promising name, "The New Republic" 
(without apologies or acknowledgments to 
Mr. Mallock). The editor explains, speaking 
as if such an undertaking were entirely novel 
and quite unprecedented, that his enterprise 
"is an attempt to find national audience for a 
journal of interpretation and opinion." That 
is, of course, what every serious-minded 
weekly review of the world's doings has hoped 
to do. It may be that "The New Republic" 
will succeed to a degree which has not hith- 
erto been achieved in America. We have 
already expressed the hope that it will. It 
does seem that there is promise in the first 
numbers of this paper of a more hospitable 
welcome to the man with an idea especially 
a man with an idea about politics or education 
which can be set down in fifteen hundred 
words than it is our American journalistic) 
custom to offer. ... 

A NOVEL BOOK-ADVERTISEMENT is brought to 

the attention of readers of a prominent news- 
paper by an observant correspondent. In the 
trade catalogue of a well-known London pub- 
lisher, he says, appears the following note on 
a certain useful work, which is named at the 
end. ' ' If, as perhaps may be, the Mailed Fist 
of Prusso-Nietzschian Immoralism has its 
knuckles smashed for ever by the strong hand 
of the free peoples of Europe (y compris les 
Busses), and its Shining Armour labeled in a 
corner of life's great Museum, it will not be 
forgotten that one organizer of victory was 
free speech. Of that some pure samples, amid 
whatever dross and tinsel, may be found 
throughout the generations in the pages of 
Hansard's Debates." Few are the books now 
on the market that may not be shown by an 
ingenious advertisement-writer to have some 
bearing on the present all-absorbing Euro- 
pean event. 



DETERRENTS TO WOULD-BE LIBRARIANS are 
often better-advised than encouragements. 
Librarianship is no bed of roses. In the Wis- 
consin "Library Bulletin" are printed sundry 
wise remarks on this subject; for example: 
"The important thing to bear in mind in se- 
lecting apprentices is that it is much easier to 
get an assistant than to get rid of one. Any 
applicant who can be deterred by a recital of 
the difficulties with which her path will be 
[be] set and the small compensation that will 
be hers, even should she continue to walk 
therein . . . should be spared no detail." 
Another rather wise utterance on the same 
page is this : ' ' An informal oral examination 
to test the quickness of thought is often illu- 
minating, and an excellent test of an examina- 
tion is to take it oneself." Best of all is the 
discovery made in a footnote that this 
shrewdly practical advice is from a library- 
school graduation thesis not from the accu- 
mulated wisdom of an experienced librarian.

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
In your " Casual Comment " of October 16 you 
chide the " self -constituted critics of literary mas- 
terpieces " such of them at least as have " pro- 
saic souls." But the bards themselves, from 
Chaucer to Matthew Arnold and Browning, have 
always been fond of criticizing one another; in a 
book of " Poets on Poets " Mrs. Strachey has gath- 
ered together the pronouncements mostly favor- 
able of no less than threescore of them upon 
their fellow-singers. The suggestion of " flower " 
for " fly " in Blanco White's famous sonnet 
"To Night" is familiar; and who has not re- 
marked Byron's carelessness of diction, and 
Crabbe's? 

Take now this passage in the " Lines Left on a 
Seat in a Yew-tree " : 

" Know that ... he who feels contempt 
For any living thing, hath faculties 
Which he hath never used : that thought with him 
Is in its infancy." 

Rousseau had already said (in " Emile"), " Speak 
of the human race with emotion, even with pity 
never with contempt." What could be humaner, 
wiser, more lucid? But when Wordsworth writes 
" Hath faculties which he hath never used," is 
there not some lack in sequence and clearness? 
Let us venture to read as follows: 

"Know that ... he who feels contempt 
For any living thing, not yet hath known 
His nobler faculties: that thought with him 
Is in its infancy."

THE IKVBNTOR OF THE TELEGRAPH.* 



Familiar though the name of Samuel F. B. 
Morse is to all intelligent persons, few are 
wont to think of him as anything more than 
an inventor, a scientist absorbed in the study 
of electro-magnetism, and the victim of some 
of the usual hardships and injustices that 
fall to the lot of almost every great inventive 
genius. The accounts of the man hitherto 
published have naturally dealt especially and 
often exclusively with Morse the inventor, to 
the neglect of Morse the painter, the sculptor, 
and the great-hearted, large-minded human 
being. Yet his life-course of fourscore years 
was half run before he turned his attention, 
as if by accident, to the field of labor in 
which he was to win his peculiar distinction 
in the eyes of the world. This division of his 
life into two equal parts is indicated to the 
eye by the similar division of his ample biog- 
raphy, now completed by his son, into two 
nearly equal volumes; and as it is the later 
Morse who is already best known to us, it may 
be well here to give chief attention to the less 
familiar and equally interesting earlier Morse 
as we find him self-portrayed in his letters 
and journals, for the most part hitherto un- 
published. 

As will appear at once to any reader, and 
as Morse's son says of him at the outset, 

" his versatility and abounding vitality were as- 
tounding. He would have been an eminent man in 
his day had he never invented the telegraph; but 
it is of absorbing interest, in following his career, 
to note how he was forced to give up one ambition 
after another, to suffer blow after blow which 
would have overwhelmed a man of less indomitable 
perseverance, until all his great energies were im- 
pelled into the one channel which ultimately led to 
undying fame." 

Probably it was this very versatility and 
abounding vitality that gave to the first years 
of young Morse 's college course at Yale a com- 
plexion not wholly satisfactory to his parents, 
the Rev. Jedediah Morse of Charlestown, 
Massachusetts, and his good wife, Elizabeth 
Ann Breese (granddaughter, by the way, of 
President Samuel Finley of Princeton Col- 
lege). Avid of pleasure, like any healthy boy 
of his age, the lad seems to have spent more 
of his time and substance in non-academic 
pursuits than was thought wise by those enti- 
tled to pronounce judgment, and it is certain

that he fitted so imperfectly into the college 
machinery that he slipped a cog and dropped 
into the class succeeding that with which he 
had entered. Moreover, he received no ap- 
pointment at graduation. His extraordinary 
power of application and tenacity of purpose 
developed later. As he was but fourteen 
years old when he entered Yale in 1805, and 
but nineteen when he received his bachelor's 
degree, there is no cause for surprise at his 
flabbiness of mental texture when he rejoined 
his family at Charlestown and, obedient to 
his parents' wishes, consented to begin life as 
a bookseller's apprentice at a salary of four 
hundred dollars a year. Already, however, 
he had begun to paint, and had gained enough 
proficiency in portraiture to secure a number 
of sitters at five dollars for a miniature on 
ivory, or one dollar for a simple profile ; and 
before many months had passed his father 
found him so absorbed in art at the expense 
of commerce that it was wisely decided to 
oppose no longer the bent of his genius, and 
plans were made for him to accompany Wash- 
ington Allston to London and there pursue 
his painting under the best available instruc- 
tion. The aged but still active Benjamin 
West's kindly reception and cordial encour- 
agement of his young compatriot were of great 
assistance to him; and he visited Copley, 
whom he found friendly but not exactly in- 
spiring in the sad decline of his powers. 
Admitted to the Royal Academy on the 
strength of a drawing from the Laocoon, he 
devoted his days to painting at home with his 
room-mate, Charles R. Leslie, of subsequent 
fame as an American artist, and his evenings 
to drawing at the Academy. From a letter of 
this golden period (the autumn of 1811) we 
quote a significant passage. 

" I was astonished to find such a difference in 
the encouragement of art between this country and 
America. In America it seemed to lie neglected 
and only thought to be an employment suited to a 
lower class of people; but here it is the constant 
subject of conversation, and the exhibitions of the 
several painters are fashionable resorts. No per- 
son is esteemed accomplished or well educated un- 
less he possesses almost an enthusiastic love for 
paintings. To possess a gallery of pictures is the 
pride of every nobleman, and they seem to vie 
with each other in possessing the most choice and 
most numerous collection." 

Though Morse's English sojourn included 
the years of our last war with the mother 
country, and though he was intensely and at 
times outspokenly patriotic, he seems to have 
met with no serious unpleasantness arising 
from his nationality, and, as the following 
quotation shows, his proficiency in art did not 
fail of recognition. A large painting, "The 



448 



THE DIAL 



[ Dec. 1 



Dying Hercules," had been sent by him to 
the Royal Academy Exhibition at Somerset 
House, and he had also made a clay model of 
the figure to help him in his work with the 
brush. He writes home in June, 1813 : 

" I send by this opportunity (Mr. Elisha God- 
dard) the little cast of the Hercules which ob- 
tained the prize this year at the Adelphi, and also 
the gold medal, which was the premium presented 
to me, before a large assembly of the nobility and 
gentry of the country, by the Duke of Norfolk, 
who also paid me a handsome compliment at the 
same time. There were present Lord Percy, the 
Margravine of Anspach, the Turkish, Sardinian, 
and Russian Ambassadors, who were pointed out 
to me, and many noblemen whom I do not now 
recollect. My great picture also has not only been 
received at the Royal Academy, but has one of the 
finest places in the rooms. It has been spoken of 
in the papers, which you must know is considered 
a great compliment; for a young artist, unless 
extraordinary, is seldom or never mentioned till he 
has exhibited several times. They not only praise 
me, but place my picture among the most attrac- 
tive in the exhibition. This I know will give you 
pleasure." 

These auspicious beginnings might have been 
expected to lead on to those supreme achieve- 
ments in art that the young painter avowedly 
aspired to, as appears from a letter to his 
parents : 

"My ambition is to be among those who shall 
revive the splendor of the fifteenth century; to 
rival the genius of a Raphael, a Michael Angelo, 
or a Titian; my ambition is to be enlisted in the 
constellation of genius now rising in this country; 
I wish to shine, not by a light borrowed from 
them, but to strive to shine the brightest." 
Perhaps if his hopes had been more modest he 
might have continued to find his happiness 
and his welfare in the practice of his art. No 
reason is apparent why he should not have 
attained a success considerably above the av- 
erage; but where the loss to art has been so 
immeasurably exceeded by the gain to science, 
one is little inclined to waste time in bewail- 
ing the inconstancy that proved a blessing to 
civilization. The rich record of Morse's pur- 
suit of his earlier calling, of his studies and 
travels, the canvases that came from his brush, 
and the lectures he was invited to deliver as 
a master in his domain, will be found in the 
first volume of the biography. 

Volume two, as above indicated, makes the 
reader acquainted with Morse the inventor, 
the eager pursuer through innumerable diffi- 
culties and delays of an idea, a startling sug- 
gestion, a dazzling possibility, that flashed into 
his mind one evening at dinner on the packet- 
ship "Sully" as he was returning home from 
Europe. It was in the autumn of 1832, but 
as the traveller did not on this voyage, as on 



previous ones, keep a careful diary, the exact 
date and circumstances cannot be given. The 
story, no longer a new one, as told by his son 
is as follows : 

" One night at the dinner-table the conversation 
chanced upon the subject of electro-magnetism, and 
Dr. Jackson described some of the more recent 
discoveries of European scientists the length of 
wire in the coil of a magnet, the fact that elec- 
tricity passed instantaneously through any known 
length of wire, and that its presence could be ob- 
served at any part of the line by breaking the 
circuit. Morse was, naturally, much interested, 
and it was then that the inspiration, which had 
lain dormant in his brain for many years, sud- 
denly came to him, and he said : ' If the presence 
of electricity can be made visible in any part of 
the circuit, I see no reason why intelligence may 
not be transmitted instantaneously by electricity.' " 
No one was startled by the suggestion, its sig- 
nificance being doubtless beyond the grasp of 
the average man; but the one who made it 
appreciated its meaning and thenceforth de- 
voted himself to the putting of his thought 
into a visible form. What sacrifices he was 
willing to make for the sake of that elusive 
end, appear from his own subsequent confes- 
sions. He says, for instance : 

" Up to the autumn of 1837 my telegraphic ap- 
paratus existed in so rude a form that I felt a 
reluctance to have it seen. My means were very 
limited so limited as to preclude the possibility 
of constructing an apparatus of such mechanical 
finish as to warrant my success in venturing upon 
its public exhibition. I had no wish to expose to 
ridicule the representative of so many hours of 
laborious thought. Prior to the summer of 1837, 
at which time Mr. Alfred Vail's attention became 
attracted to my telegraph, I depended upon my 
pencil for subsistence. Indeed, so straitened were 
my circumstances that, in order to save time to 
carry out my invention and to economize my 
scanty means, I had for months lodged and eaten 
in my studio, procuring my food in small quanti- 
ties from some grocery, and preparing it myself. 
To conceal from my friends the stinted manner in 
which I lived, I was in the habit of bringing my 
food to my room in the evenings, and this was my 
mode of life for many years." 

Credit for the discovery of the principle 
of multiple telegraphy is claimed for Morse 
by his son, and a letter of the inventor's 
written in 1842 is published by him for the 
first time in proof of the claim. Why this dis- 
covery should have been lost sight of is some- 
what of a mystery. It was fully ten years 
later that the same discovery was again made 
and put to use by others. Wireless telegraphy 
is hinted at in the above-named letter, and 
credit has been accorded to Morse. 

This full and apparently faithful biog- 
raphy from an admiring and affectionate 
son's hand contains much more of the man

Morse than has here been even faintly indi-

A BRAZILIAN JOURXEY.* 



When Colonel Roosevelt went to Africa, 
there were many who doubted the sincerity of 
his scientific aims. Here is a man, some peo- 
ple said, who wants to fight and to kill ; and 
since we are not engaged in war, he will kill 
the large animals of Africa, which are suffi- 
ciently formidable to be interesting. There 
was enough truth in this estimate to make it 
plausible, but it was crude and unjust. Mr. 
Roosevelt is not a laboratory naturalist. There) 
is apparently no reason to suppose that he 
would ever have the patience or the interest in 
minute details to write a technical scientific 
monograph, or carry out a series of experi- 
ments. Love of adventure, delight in the 
struggle for existence, energy, persistence 
all these and kindred qualities do not neces- 
sarily or usually make a scientific man, but 
they are invaluable for certain kinds of scien- 
tific work. The opponents of militarism may 
be inclined, at the present time, to regard Mr. 
Roosevelt as a rather dangerous individual; 
but if they will read the account of his jour- 
ney through Brazil, they will find therein 
much cause for satisfaction. Here we find all 
those robust qualities, which have in different 
ages wrought so much good and ill to mankind, 
thrown whole-heartedly into the business of 
scientific exploration. Here is one of the 
" substitutes for war," which "William James, 
reasoning as a psychologist, felt to be neces- 
sary. There are many such substitutes, but 
they must be sought out and followed up, or 
there will be a genuine danger that with the 
progress of civilization some of the more valu- 
able human qualities will tend to atrophy 
from disuse. Mr. Roosevelt, in his own per- 
son (and from statements he has published 
one is justified in thinking he would agree to 
this) , illustrates the transition from the more 
primitive hunting and fighting instincts to the 
condition in which those same instincts are 
trained to serve broadly human ends. Even 
his militarism, which some of us cannot ap- 
prove, has taken on a cosmopolitan aspect, and 
looks (whether correctly or not) toward the 
welfare of the whole world. Thus, in the

Roosevelt. Illustrated. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. 



future, one feels that Mr. Roosevelt will stand 
out as a great typical figure, the herald, per- 
haps, of some things which he would himself 
scarcely approve. Looking for a psychological 
parallel, one thinks of Luther. 

Few people are aware of the really note- 
worthy zoological discoveries made by Colonel 
Roosevelt and his associates on their African 
journey. The collection at the National Mu- 
seum is truly wonderful, and simply as an 
exhibit has surprised many, including a mud- 
dle-headed congressman who was reported as 
saying that he would never vote for appropria- 
tions for the Museum, as the whole thing was 
evidently an advertisement for Mr. Roosevelt, 
whom he hated ! Specialists in zoology know, 
however, that on the strictly scientific side our 
knowledge of African mammals and birds has 
been greatly increased. The Brazilian expedi- 
tion will assuredly yield like results, when the 
two thousand five hundred birds, five hundred 
mammals, and other materials have been care- 
fully investigated. This great number of 
specimens suggests indiscriminate slaughter, 
but as the narrative shows, it is a carefully 
selected series, no animals or birds being killed 
unless required for scientific study or for 
food, or because they were pests. There was 
no careless or wanton shooting. So short a 
time has elapsed between the completion of the 
journey and the publication of the book, that 
there has been no opportunity to prepare a 
summary of the zoological discoveries ; but it 
is to be hoped that an appendix will be added 
to a subsequent edition. On the other hand, 
as every one knows, we are given full details 
about the large river, to be called Rio Teodoro, 
for the first time descended and mapped. The 
reviewer recalls an occasion when the veteran 
explorer of Brazil, the late A. R. Wallace, took 
out a map, and running his finger over this 
very region, remarked that there still remained 
notable geographical work for any able man. 
He marvelled that in the many years since he 
visited the country, so little scientific work had 
been done in the upper Amazon valley, con- 
sidering the vast opportunities offered. Mr. 
Roosevelt's narrative shows how difficult and 
dangerous the work of exploration in these 
regions may be, but at the same time how 
much is possible, given energy and skill, with 
only moderate time and means. It is also 
clearly indicated that most interesting and 
valuable results await a resident naturalist 
(even though resident for only a short time) 
in these regions quite without any exceptional 
hazards. 

The Brazilian expedition is officially to be 
known as the "Expedicao Scientifica Roose- 
velt-Rondon, " as it was designated by the

Brazilian Government. It was due to Colonel 
Roosevelt's initiative, but he himself continu- 
ally insists on the dominant part played by his 
associate, the Brazilian Colonel Rondon, and 
on the zoological work of Messrs. Cherrie and 
Miller, of the American Museum of Natural 
History. "Whenever a group of men engage in 
exploration, it is difficult and unnecessary to 
divide the credit, which largely belongs to the 
group rather than to individuals. In official 
documents the work of associates and subordi- 
nates is not always recognized, but happily 
there is an increasing tendency to do full jus- 
tice to all, and it must be said that in the in- 
stance now before us we can only fear that the 
author has not adequately represented his own 
services. 

The book is readable and interesting from 
beginning to end. It has just the right admix- 
ture of narrative, observation, and reflection. 
It not only represents the reactions and im- 
pressions of an exceptionally able and well- 
trained mind, but is the work of a superman, 
in the sense that it embodies the combined 
thought of the members of the expedition, who 
were so variously skilled in different ways. 
There is I think too much repetition of state- 
ments, but even this may have a pedagogical 
justification. 

In another edition, one would like to see 
added a few footnotes, bringing out more 
clearly the zoological relationships of certain 
of the animals. Thus there are many refer- 
ences to the fishes, but the reader is left uncer- 
tain how these are related to each other and to 
fishes of other countries. The very interesting 
character of the South American fish-fauna 
could be explained, in its broader outlines, in 
a small space. T. D. A. COCKERELL. 



HORACE WALPOLE'S "DEAR BOTH."* 



In 1852 died two remarkable women, sis- 
ters, both well along toward their ninetieth 
year. So closely had Mary and Agnes Berry 
been associated for more than half a century 
with the literature and society of England 
and the Continent, that their loss was widely 
regretted. Mary, the elder, had edited the 
works of Horace Walpole and engaged in 
other literary enterprises; but in their own 
time, as now, the two were better known for 
their personality than for anything they pro- 
duced. Maria Edgeworth, anxious that a 
brother who had been long imprisoned in 
France should now have the advantage of

good society, set about accomplishing that end 
by giving him a letter of introduction to the 
sisters. Kate Perry expressed the general 
feeling when she wrote, after their death: 
"There is no salon now to compare with that 
of the Miss Berrys. " 

In 1865 Lady Theresa Lewis published 
three volumes of extracts from Mary Berry's 
letters and correspondence. Mr. Melville now 
supplements these with a book of 448 pages, 
well printed, freely illustrated, and composed 
almost wholly of new material. He gives 
Agnes Berry an increased prominence, though 
he reserves the chief role for Mary. The cor- 
respondence of the Hon. Mrs. Darner and of 
General O'Hara with the latter, is the best 
and most readable part of the new volume. 

It may be as well to comment at once upon 
Mr. Melville's work and then devote our at- 
tention to the Misses Berry themselves. Mr. 
Melville relies mainly upon the correspon- 
dence to carry on the story, though he sup- 
plies narrative when needed, and tacks on the- 
necessary footnotes. This part of his task is, 
in general, well performed. There are repeti- 
tions, however, and other signs of haste, as 
when Bertie Greathead is told about twice- 
within a few pages (121 and 125) and made 
bi-sexual. A more difficult problem was to- 
decide what letters should be included. Here- 
Mr. Melville was between the devil and the 
deep sea. If he omitted materials made acces- 
sible already by Lady Theresa Lewis or in the 
correspondence of Horace Walpole, he would' 
have only left-overs to choose from. If he 
inserted them, he could not cry, "hitherto 
unpublished." He adopted the first of these 
alternatives, wrongly we think. Readers are 
not usually able or, if able, willing to 
piece out their knowledge from other publica- 
tions. Moreover, the book is padded : some of 
the letters from people of distinction are so 
formal as to be of little consequence, while- 
many from less conspicuous people are tire- 
some. Finally, there are almost no direct 
utterances from Walpole Walpole, whose 
connection with the sisters remains the most 
interesting thing about them. 

The outward life of the sisters was marked 
by few striking events. Their mother died 
early and they were left to the care of an 
improvident, if kindly, father whose annuity, 
though moderate, should have enabled him to 
lay something by for them. They early had' 
the advantage of travel, an advantage they 
continued to enjoy through life. In 1788, 
while temporarily resident at Twickenham, 
they became acquainted with Walpole, then 
in his old days. Two years later, under his: 
persuasions, they established themselves at

Little Strawberry Hill. When he died, in 
1797, he left them the house, together with a 
"bequest in money. It was here and in Lon- 
don, chiefly, that their days were spent. The 
friendship with Walpole had given them such 
prominence that they were thrown thereafter 
with the most distinguished people. To study 
their lives, indeed, is to see familiarly many 
of the celebrities of the age. 

Not all of their importance was borrowed, 
however. When Walpole first met them, he 
described them thus : 

" They are . . . the best-informed and the most 
perfect creatures I ever saw at their age. They are 
exceedingly sensible, entirely natural and un- 
affected, frank, and being qualified to talk on any 
subject, nothing is so easy and agreeable as their 
conversation, nor more apposite than their answers 
and observations. The eldest, I discovered by 
chance, understands Latin, and is a perfect French- 
woman in her language. The younger draws 
charmingly. . . . They are of pleasing figures; 
Mary, the eldest, sweet, with fine dark eyes, that 
are very lively when she speaks, with a symmetry 
of face that is the more interesting from being 
pale; Agnes, the younger, has an agreeable sensi- 
ble countenance, hardly to be called handsome, but 
.almost. She is less animated than Mary, but seems, 
out of deference to her sister to speak seldomer, for 
they dote on each other, and Mary is always prais- 
ing her sister's talents. I must even tell you they 
dress within the bounds of fashion, though fash- 
ionably ; but without the excrescences and balconies 
with which modern hoydens overwhelm and barri- 
cade their persons. In short, good sense, informa- 
tion, simplicity, and ease characterize the Berrys; 
and this is not particularly mine, who am apt to be 
prejudiced, but the universal voice of all who know 
them." 

The prim, old-time pictures of the sisters, 
and the quiet demeanor of which we hear so 
much, might incline us to think them ' ' goody- 
goody. ' ' They had too much force to be that. 
Even Agnes, self-effacing, submissive it would 
seem in matters of love, was far from weak. 
She was one of those persons who exercise a 
tact so perfect that it seems effortless until 
we stop to realize the strength of character 
behind it. Thackeray thought her the more 
naturally gifted of the two. However that 
may be, the qualities of Mary were more pro- 
nounced. She had a keen eye for the faults 
of others. She wrote of the Duke of Welling- 
ton: 

" The simplicity and frankness of his manners, 
and the way in which he speaks of public affairs are 
really those of a great man: altho' talking of the 
allied sovereigns, their views, etc., etc., he says we 
found out so and so, we intend such and such 
things, quite as treating de Couronne a Couronne." 

She was potentially prankish. Here is the 



account in her journal of her presentation to 
the Princess of Wales : 

" I don't think she was taken with me, as she saw, 
when I did not suppose she did, the moue which I 
made to Lady Sheffield when she proposed it to 
me . . . which I changed for a proper Court face 
the moment I saw her looking, and the thing 
inevitable." 

Happily the Princess forgave the indiscretion, 
and often invited the sisters to Kensington 
Palace. Sometimes Mary was betrayed into 
an indiscretion by pique. When her one 
acted play (produced anonymously) failed on 
the stage, she published it with an advertise- 
ment which withheld her own name but 
dragged in that of Walpole. She could be 
resentful too. Cadaverous Samuel Rogers 
liked her little and called on her but once a 
year on the day they shared perforce, as 
they chanced to be precisely of an age. ' ' Miss 
Berry and I are twins," he remarked to a 
friend; "I have just been to see how she 
wears; this is her and my birthday." Her 
comment was: "When I heard this, I went 
to my looking-glass to see if it reflected such 
a death's-head as his." 

Despite the belief that long was current, 
Walpole did not propose to Mary Berry. His 
affection for her was genuine, however. To 
Agnes he was less ardently attached, but he 
took care to include "wife the second" in the 
matrimonial alliance he pretended to have 
formed. He referred to himself as an old 
" fondle- wife, " to them as "my beloved 
spouses," " twin- wives, " "dear both." The 
playful tone of his communications to them is 
manifest from the first. ' ' I am afraid of pro- 
testing how much I delight in your society, 
lest I should seem to affect being gallant, ' ' he 
wrote in 1789 ; ' ' but if two negatives make an 
affirmative, why may not two ridicules com- 
pose one piece of sense? and therefore, as I 
am in love with you both, I trust it is a proof 
of the good sense of your devoted H. Wal- 
pole. ' ' While we are sent elsewhere for these 
letters of Walpole, we are grateful to Mr. 
Melville for the fresh glimpses he gives of the 
man's devotion through the ample correspon- 
dence of the Hon. Mrs. Darner with Mary 
Berry. Here we see an old man gay with the 
sprightliness of youth yet peevish with the 
impatience of age. He is anxious when the 
post brings him no word, is so elated with the 
letters which come that he must read them 
forthwith to Mrs. Darner, is curiously indif- 
ferent to the letters sent to her, and turns up 
his nose at Madame d' Albany, will never for- 
give her in fact, for not recognizing immedi- 
ately the name of Mary Berry, though she had 
heard it before as Mary Barry.

Walpole was in part responsible for the 
unhappy outcome of Mary Berry's connection 
with General Charles O'Hara. This officer 
had served with distinction in America until 
captured with Cornwallis at Yorktown, and 
had since acquitted himself well in Europe. 
He was a man of forceful and fascinating 
presence. To him Mary Berry plighted her 
troth; but she would not marry him at once 
for fear of hurting Walpole and of doing an 
injustice to her father and sister. An ap- 
pointment to the governorship of Gibraltar 
took him from her side. Under the wiles of 
less worthy women, his unstable nature re- 
pented very quickly of its former attachment. 
To his efforts to break the engagement in such 
a way as to imply that the fault lay with her, 
she replied spiritedly and yet with modera- 
tion. She never ceased to believe that the 
union which would have come under happier 
auspices "would have called out all the 
powers of my mind and all the warmest feel- 
ings of my heart." When he died, a few 
years subsequent to the rupture, she sealed 
up her correspondence with him. In her old 
days she opened it again and recorded in a 
pathetic note her "conviction that some feel- 
ings in some minds are indelible."

THE PATHFINDER."* 



Mr. Dellenbaugh has entered into his sub- 
ject with enthusiasm. The frontier expe- 
riences of his own career give him a natural 
bent of sympathy toward a character like that 
of John C. Fremont. In fact, Fremont had 
in him powerful elements of attraction for 
Americans in general, and the mere fact 
that his hold on the public esteem was ever 
seriously shaken is enough to prove that some 
very powerful cause lay back of the change, 
whether just or unjust. 

The underlying motive in Mr. Dellen- 
baugh 's book is to reverse the unfavorable ver- 
dict, and restore the admiration and respect 
for his hero which has always been the senti- 
ment of a few and was at one time that of the 
many. This result, however, he aims to secure 
not so much by a direct clash with opposing 
argument as by a lively presentation of Fre- 
mont's varied and always interesting career. 
From the latter point of view, as a picture of 
western exploration more or less vitally con- 
nected with the logical rounding out of our 
national domain, the volume is the success

and Its Relation to the Exploration and Development of Our

Dellenbaugh. With maps and illustrations. New York: G. P. 
Putnam's Sons. 



which the name of Dellenbaugh implies. It 
brings back in a very vivid way pictures of 
early western conditions which are more valu- 
able for study now than ever before, since we 
are far enough away from the reality to recog- 
nize and profit by the mistakes of our period 
of territorial expansion and not merely to 
revel in its material gains. 

But when we come to the other question, 
Has Mr. Dellenbaugh reversed the verdict of 
history as to the serious short-comings of Fre- 
mont? we are forced to say that the book is 
unconvincing. As an explorer, after years of 
experience and many brilliant achievements to 
his credit, he was capable of surprising blun- 
ders of judgment even in that field. One can- 
not read Mr. Dellenbaugh 's own account of 
the expedition of the winter of 1848-9, with 
its story of disaster and death hardly sur- 
passed outside the field of polar catastrophes, 
and not feel that Fremont was foolhardy to 
the verge of criminality. He was warned in 
November, before entering the mountains, that 
the snow was deeper than ever before known, 
by either whites or Indians, and he knew that 
if he got safely over the crests he would pass 
not into a mild, inhabited land where recuper- 
ation would be easy, but into "an elevated 
labyrinth of plateaus, canyons and more 
mountains, unpeopled and trackless. ' ' to quote 
the author's own description. At Pueblo, Bill 
Williams, an experienced mountaineer, ad- 
vised strongly against the undertaking, but 
Fremont was unshakable and Williams was 
finally persuaded to go along as leader. Fre- 
mont subsequently charged the disaster to 
faulty guidance on Williams 's part, and this 
explanation appears in no less an authority 
than the new Encyclopaedia Britannica, but 
Mr. Dellenbaugh 's sense of justice will not al- 
low him to clear Fremont at the expense of un- 
merited reproach upon Williams. "Williams 
led them from Pueblo, Colorado, by a fairly 
direct road to the turning-back point, on the 
very line which Fremont had proposed to 
follow." It was only an especially fatal case 
of that lack of balanced judgment and excess 
of egotism which marred Fremont's career at 
so many other points as well. 

The author does not go deeply into his Civil 
War career, but endeavors so far as possible to 
clear him of reproach in the matters which led 
first to his removal from his command in Mis- 
souri and later to his entire separation from 
the army. The endeavor is unsuccessful. 
Fremont confused the situation in the public 
mind by his bold bid for the admiration of the 
more advanced anti-slavery advocates, but 
even that could not cover up the utter admin- 
istrative disorder in his department. If, as 



1914] 



THE DIAL 



453 



Mr. Dellenbaugh asserts, he found confusion 
there when he assumed command, it is none 
the less in evidence that every week of his 
command made it confusion worse confounded. 
If one wants an effective presentation of the 
case in brief, let him turn to Chapters XXIII. 
and XXIV. of the fourth volume of Nicolay 
and Hay's book on Lincoln. The second of 
these chapters deals conclusively also with 
Fremont's Missouri Emancipation Proclama- 
tion, the best that can be said for which is 
only that it showed its author's heart to be in 
the right place so far as regards the institu- 
tion of slavery. That each commander in the 
field should have the right to determine the 
final status of human beings without consulta- 
tion with the President and without regard to 
an act of Congress just passed, is inadmissible 
on any other basis than that of administrative 
anarchy. The truth is that Fremont's mind 
M r as not built on lines of law and order. The 
difficulties that grew out of this fact in his 
public life were closely paralleled in the con- 
fusion of his more strictly personal affairs, 
especially the famous Mariposa land grants. 
It is true that there is a disposition to scoff at 
the mind that allows itself to run in channels 
of law and order as stupidly bromidical, and 
perhaps Fremont may yet be lifted out of 
reproach as a kind of business and official 
cubist or vorticist, born out of due time. But 
so long as generally accepted standards of 
judgment and conduct remain, it is likely to 
remain the verdict of the careful reader that 
Fremont's career shows a disfiguring propor- 
tion of unwise conduct, based on undisciplined 
judgment. Mr. Dellenbaugh 's suggestion that 
he was the victim of West Point jealousy can- 
not remove the positive and ample evidence of 
his own shortcomings, nor is it fortified by any 
positive proof that such jealousy was actually 
at work. W. H. JOHNSON. 



PHILADELPHIA.* 



We like to think of America as a country 
that offers a career to talent. All good Amer- 
icans used to persuade themselves that we had 
actually realized that noble ideal. But there 
are now plenty of cavillers ready to dispute 
the point, and so it will be safer to discrimi- 
nate. If we vary the formula a bit, and say 
that we in America have been careful not to 
close the door on financial talent, we shall not 
find many to quarrel with us : for our world 
of business has been, up to now, a singularly 
open world, easy of access on certain terms. 

* OUR PHILADELPHIA. Described by Elizabeth Robins Pen- 
nell and illustrated with one hundred and five lithographs by 
Joseph Pennell. Philadelphia : J. B. Lippincott Co. 



This has not, of course, been the fruit of 
any of the political theories embodied in our 
constitution. We are natural pragmatists, 
our business men most of all. It is simply the 
result of our unique fitness for business and 
of the complete seriousness with which we 
take it. The American knows his world so 
thoroughly that he has been able to enter into 
its possession without petty jealousy or any 
of the exclusiveness that springs from a whole- 
some fear of competition. He has welcomed 
suggestions from whatever source, confident 
that his knowledge would enable him to sepa- 
rate the wheat from the chaff. He has been 
willing to reward the possessor of " ideas " 
with the best gifts at his command, and the re- 
sult of this hospitable attitude has been that 
the stock of financial talent in Wall Street has 
been constantly renewed from without. But 
talent is not to be had on easy terms ; it drives 
a hard bargain. It asks for nothing less than 
complete recognition, and, in the face of this 
demand, "society" here has been usually 
pliant. It has, indeed, accommodated itself 
to the requirements of business: so that the 
man without ancestors who has contrived to 
make himself indispensable to Wall Street 
has, on the whole, had a cordial welcome in 
Fifth Avenue as well. In response to this 
hard necessity of an industrial civilization, 
our aristocratic stock has undergone a free 
renewal from the social Hinterland, as any 
one at all familiar with life in New York can 
testify. 

This is not to deny that we have ever been 
ancestor-worshippers. Ancestor-worship has 
appeared among us, but it took shallow root 
and has always been looked at askance as an 
exotic. Our industrial civilization did not 
afford a generous soil for so delicate a growth, 
and the rage for its cultivation has already 
sensibly declined. So true is this that we 
younger Americans can study that transient 
phase of our national spirit best in the me- 
moirs of the last generation or in porten- 
tously solemn books on social history. 

Even in the older cities of the East, where 
an old tradition furnished the best soil for 
ancestor-worship, it was unevenly cultivated. 
New Yorkers, with their eyes ever fixed on the 
main chance, were not to be drawn aside from 
the chief end of man the pursuit of money 
to indulge in what was, after all, but a luxury 
of sentiment. Other cities, feeling less pres- 
sure from without, were less practical; and 
of these one of the chief was Philadelphia. In 
Philadelphia, during the period immediately 
following the war, ancestor-worship flour- 
ished to an almost incredible extent; and 
novelists, or other historians of our social life,

who happen to be curious as to this phenome- 
non, will find it in its purest form in Mrs. 
Pennell's "Our Philadelphia," a book of 
memories in which the author has collabo- 
rated with her gifted artist-husband. 

Mrs. Pennell, the daughter of an old Phila- 
delphia family, passed her early life in the 
sacred precincts of that district bounded by 
"Chestnut, Walnut, Spruce, and Pine." 
Philadelphians of that day (the period after 
the war) did not absolutely pass from the 
cradle to the grave oblivious of the annoying 
fact that the real world was not also so cir- 
cumspectly bounded. No, they recognized an 
outer world, whose existence they were bound 
as humane persons to deplore. They had to 
regret that the opportunities for felicity, so 
generously and appropriately bestowed upon 
them by the mere accident of birth, were not 
shared by others. They satisfied their sense 
of duty in this respect, but they showed no 
laudable desire to extend the right of citizen- 
ship to the barbarian. They were a self- 
sustaining community of the elect; they had 
been elected by their forefathers; and fair- 
ness led them to conclude that if other mor- 
tals chose to be less careful in the selection 
of grandfathers (as the existence of other 
communities proved they did) why, it was 
after all their own fault. 

These Philadelphians, solid bankers and 
brokers, breakfasting solidly on scrapple and 
buckwheat cakes, wrapped in sober and digni- 
fied costumes, living with an elegant sim- 
plicity in their red brick houses with white 
stone trimmings, carefully scrutinizing their 
visiting lists and guarding themselves against 
the contamination of casual contacts, defile 
through Mrs. Pennell's pages with a con- 
vincing air of life. They made of life an 
elaborate ritual rather than an art. Talent 
for them was limited to the talent of being 
' ' well born. ' ' If one happened to be a Biddle, 
a Cadwallader, an Ingersoll, or a Wharton, 
it was idle to look for giddier heights to scale ; 
one had already achieved the ultimate and 
might die with a dignified serenity. Even 
those who did not belong to the supreme clans 
might hope to be similarly happy in their 
taking off if only in the meantime they could 
obtain an invitation to the historic Assembly 
Ball the supreme test of status. Of this 
famous institution (for it really deserved to 
be called such), Mrs. Pennell writes: 

" I am not sure what was the number, what the 
quality of ancestors the Assembly exacted, but I 
know that it was as inexorable in its exactions as 
the Council of Ten. It would have been easier for 
troops of camels to pass through the eye of a 
needle than for one Philadelphian north of Market 



street to get through the Assembly door. I am 
told that matters are worse to-day when Philadel- 
phia society has increased its numbers until new 
limits must be set to the Assembly lest it perish of 
its own unwieldiness. The applicants must pro- 
duce not only forefathers but fathers and mothers 
on the list, and the Philadelphian whose name was 
there more than a century and a half ago cannot 
make good his rights if his parents neglected to 
establish theirs. And to be refused is not merely 
humiliation, but humiliation with Philadelphia for 
witness, and the misery and shame that are the 
burden of the humiliated." 

Drawing on the memories of her own girl- 
hood, Mrs. Pennell has given us a detailed and 
painstaking picture of Philadelphia interiors, 
with their ' ' rosewood and rep masterpieces of 
a deplorable period," their decorations of 
beaded cushions and worsted-work mats and 
tidies, with the family portraits on the walls 
and the inevitable engraving of Gilbert Stu- 
art's Washington over the dining-room man- 
telpiece. A fitting frame, surely, for these 
excellent Americans who inhabited a special 
milieu, and exhibited its excellence and its 
defects with an ideal fulness. Mrs. Pennell 
tells us how they dined (never vulgarly in 
hotels, as now), how they entertained, how 
they worshipped; what they thought of poli- 
tics, of social questions, of art and litera- 
ture, when they condescended to think of 
such things at all. And she is able to tell us 
of these things with an added intimacy pre- 
cisely because she has been able to accept the 
old Philadelphia view of life without chal- 
lenge. Its exclusiveness was to her but a 
natural safeguard of the dignified domes- 
ticity which Philadelphians had been able to 
achieve. Her criticisms she reserved for the 
Philadelphia of the present, a Philadelphia at 
last thoroughly Americanized, in which wealth 
is crowding out dignified poverty, in which 
aliens are driving the natives from the only 
quarter "in which they choose to live," and 
efficiency is working to eliminate the favorite 
sons. 

Mrs. Pennell assures us that Philadelphia is 
a beautiful city, but her assurance persuades 
us of that fact far less directly than the hun- 
dred lithographs with which Mr. Joseph Pen- 
nell illustrates the text. They are uniformly 
charming ; and because of them one feels safe 
in saying that no gift book of the season will 
be more alluring to the eye.

RECENT FICTION.* 



Some one, having it in mind, perhaps, to 
controvert Zola's propaganda of the scientific 
novel, has said that "novels are only an ex- 
pression of temperament anyway." That is, 
of course, why we read them. We choose, not 
so much those novelists whose material, as 
such, interests us, or those whose ability ena- 
bles them to conform to our standards of 
artistry, as those novelists whose view of the 
world is sympathetic to our own. In some 
degree, we expect that a writer of fiction will 
express us. If he does not do this, most of us 
will not read him. That detached curiosity 
which leads readers through many pages 
which they do not approve, in spirit, is very 
rare. We say of a book, "I like it," or, "I 
don't like it"; we do not say so often, "It 
is well done," or, "It is badly done." This 
is not merely because we are lazy and incom- 
petent; it is because we are much more con- 
cerned about what we like than about what 
we might admire or respect. The charm of 
reading is not altogether different from the 
charm of conversing. Conversation among 
people who are perfectly agreed about life 
and conduct can hardly exist. But conversa- 
tion among people who differ about material 
matters is so uncommon that it is commonly 
called by another name. Conversation among 
people who differ about anything important 
is only achieved in highly sophisticated socie- 
ties and then only by virtue of a convention 
which demands that the subject about which 
there is a difference shall be ignored. So it is 
between novelists and readers. The novelist 
expresses his temperament in his work and 
those who are capable of liking that tempera- 
ment, that is to say, those who have a certain 
affinity for it, are capable of enjoying the 
expression of it. 

Mr. Wells seems peculiarly a novelist who 
is read by disciples. Perhaps we should say- 
by many disciples. His popularity is negligi- 
ble to those who measure popularity by the 
hundred thousand copies sold. But is there 
a writer of English more read by young peo- 
ple with a turn for ideas? A familiarity 
with Mr. Wells is required among them. He 
is their honored prophet. For one thing, it 
is a groping soul that he has been exposing to 
us so industriously for the past decade or two. 
It differs from the souls of his readers chiefly 
in its power to record its gropings. For

another thing, Mr. Wells is not too far behind 
or ahead of his time. He thinks that women 
need, and ought to want, far greater freedom 
than our present customs allow them. But 
he has never asked us to admire a really in- 
transigent woman. He sympathizes with 
illicit love. But he is no Casanova. He is 
impatient of our educational methods. But 
he shares our faith in education. In a word, 
Mr. Wells is aspiring rather than iconoclastic 
and unconventional rather than immoral. 
Finally and this may be one reason of his 
vogue and the reason of his failure to do all 
that has been expected of him he is not an 
artist of the severely disciplined sort. He has 
a splendid talent for setting down minor char- 
acters, the talent which he used to such pur- 
pose in "Kipps" and in "The History of Mr. 
Polly." If his skill in this respect, and his 
fund of material on which to exercise it, are 
less than Dickens 's were he has the advantage 
of a knowledge of many things that Dickens 
never thought of and would not have written 
about if he had. He has, besides, this curiosity 
about what is going on in the world, from 
aeroplanes to advertising, which he has re- 
corded most successfully in "Tono-Bungay" 
and in "The New Machiavelli" and which 
has given him his place as a prophet to the 
younger generation. But the talent and the 
curiosity have never been fused. The result 
is a book like "The Wife of Sir Isaac Har- 
man." It is an immensely interesting book. 
It is not the novel we expect, that we demand. 
Sir Isaac Harman gave his wife every luxury 
except liberty to do what she wanted. She 
interested herself in model tea shops. She 
made friends with an author such an au- 
thor! She played hob with Sir Isaac's peace 
of mind. When Sir Isaac died the author 
begged so hard for a kiss that she finally gave 
him one, or several, or half a dozen. It does 
not matter. Why couldn't Lady Harman 
have been something more than an ineffectual 
wraith? Why couldn't the novel have begun 
at the point where it left off? Nobody knows 
except Mr. Wells, and he is too busy writing 
to answer such questions. 

M. Anatole France is a connoisseur of iron- 
ies. His style, so graceful, so flexible, so 
equal, always, to the occasion, is almost too 
perfect. Its perfection is apparent even in 
English, at least in the generally excellent 
English of Mrs. Wilfrid Jackson. M. Anatole 
France plays with ideas the most difficult as 
easily as old ladies gossip. And if he is occa- 
sionally too Gallic for the susceptibilities of 
those who read him in English, Mrs. Jackson 
has, we are informed, taken care to modify 
him. His attitude toward the world, so

gently skeptical, so appreciatively ironical, 
offends some and is enjoyed more than any- 
thing else in the world by a few : 

"Amid the distractions of youth his faith re- 
mained intact, since he left it severely alone. He 
had never examined a single tenet. Nor had he 
enquired a whit more closely into the ideas of 
morality current in the grade of society to which 
he belonged. He took them just as they came. 
Thus in every situation that arose he cut an emi- 
nently respectable figure which he would have 
assuredly failed to do, had he been given to medi- 
tating on the foundations of morality." 

" Thus the conversation went on until evening ; 
it was marked by obscenities that would have 
brought the blush I will not say to a cuirassier, 
for cuirassiers are frequently chaste, but even to a 
Parisienne." 

Those are typical paragraphs from our au- 
thor. Readers who like them will find others 
that they will like even better, since a para- 
graph which may be reproduced by itself is 
seldom so effective as one which is placed 
firmly in its context. Readers who find these 
paragraphs mildly distasteful will know bet- 
ter than to read M. Anatole France, for they 
will find not less, but more, of the flavor which 
is his. 

The Countess von Arnim, who is, we believe, 
the author of "Elizabeth and Her German 
Garden" and, therefore, the author of "The 
Pastor's Wife," writes in a vein curiously 
reminiscent of Mr. "Wells. It is perhaps im- 
possible that Mr. Wells should have conceived 
the final situation of "The Pastor's Wife," 
but not at all impossible that he should have 
conceived the opening one. The heroine of 
the story, Ingeborg, was the daughter of an 
English bishop a positively Wellsian bishop. 
She had her chance to go on a spree because 
a toothache proved beyond the skill of the 
local dentist and required to be treated in 
London. T,he master mechanic of the metrop- 
olis effected a cure at the first appointment 
and there was Ingeborg with 50 in her pocket 
and a fortnight on her hands. She chose a 
personally conducted tour on the Continent, 
met Herr Dremmel, who was pastor to a small 
community in East Prussia and the most Ger- 
man of Germans, and returned home engaged 
to be married. There are tragic possibilities 
in what follows, possibilities that the Countess 
von Arnim has suggested with a good deal of 
power, despite the insouciance of her manner 
and her humor. The effect at the end would 
have been less dubious than it is if she had 
been content to do one thing or the other. It 
requires genius happily to mix farce and com- 
edy and tragedy ; the Countess von Arnim has 
only a most charming talent. She has. for 
instance, enjoyed immensely writing about 



the artist who endeavored to conduct a liaison 
with Ingeborg, but she has made him too much 
a dunce, too unbelievably the naively philan- 
dering male. Her satire would be more 
pointed if her figure were less of an idiot. 
And yet, despite its uncertainties, its waver- 
ing, its faults of conception and construction, 
the book presents a point of view which has 
endeared the author's books to many critical 
readers. What she says is sometimes acid and 
sometimes sweet, but it is always well said.

Far more thrilling in reality than in the modest

trays. Many have attempted the perilous passage,,

port of the first exploration of the stupendous 
gorge was the pioneer account, in elaborate form, 
of its wonders; and Mr. F. S. Dellenbaugh after- 
ward described its majesty and romance. Mr. 
Kolb's book is, therefore, the third in the field, but 
is the first to chronicle a daring attempt to capture 
by camera and in moving-picture form the myriad 
marvels of the Grand Canon. Long and intimate 
familiarity with the region, an abundant stock of 
health and strength and courage, and an unsink- 
able boat (two, in fact) with a flat bottom, seem to 
have constituted the adventurers' most important 
equipment for a successful issue to their enterprise. 
As was to have been expected, their cameras fur- 
nish a rich and unusual illustrative accompaniment 
to the interesting narrative. 

The sublimities of the Canadian Rocky Moun- 
tains are well set forth by Mr. Lawrence J. Burpee, 
F.R.G.S., in a beautifully illustrated volume, 
"Among the Canadian Alps" (Lane), which re- 
views in a very readable manner the history of 
mountain-climbing in that region of awe-inspiring 
scenery and all but prohibitive alpine peaks. From 
the explorations of Niverville in 1751 to the final 
conquest of Mount Robson, " the Monarch of the 
Rockies," a few years ago, Mr. Burpee tells the 
story of his own and others' adventures in this land 
of stupendous summits. His pictures, from photo- 
graphs, of such peaks as Mount Assiniboine, " the 
Canadian Matterhorn," Mount Wapta, Mount Le- 
froy, Mount Resplendant (named, evidently, by 
neither a Latin nor a French scholar), and Mount 
Robson, heighten the marvel of their ever having 
been even approached by the daring mountaineer.

capped summit, are realistically set before us in 
the half-hundred (less one) excellent views, some 
of which must have been difficult to capture with 
the camera. Bibliography and maps close this 
interesting and well-written book. The volume is 
ornamentally bound and boxed. 

Mr. Thomas Dykes Beasley emigrated from En- 
gland to California in his early manhood, and had 
the great joy of meeting Bret Harte in San Fran- 
cisco on the eve of that author's rise to fame as the 
creator of the Heathen Chinee. That was forty- 
four years ago, but so strong was the impression 
made on the young Englishman by the American 
author that the former has now felt moved to trace 
the latter's footsteps among the Sierras; and he 
has told the story of his travels in "A Tramp 
through the Bret Harte Country," which he calls 
" a plain unvarnished tale," and which, though not 
containing much about Bret Harte, is somewhat 
reminiscent of him and his times and associates, 
and is very good reading, not lacking in " local 
color" and, no cold commendation, erring rather on 
the side of brevity than of length. Abundant views 
from the author's camera, with a map of the seven 
counties traversed by him, accompany the narra- 
tive, and the whole is put into excellent book form 
by the house of Messrs. Paul Elder & Co. Mr. 
Charles A. Murdock supplies a " foreword " giving 
an outline of Bret Harte's life. 

Fit accompaniment to the opening of the Panama 
Canal, Mr. Arthur Bullard's authoritative histori- 
cal and descriptive work, " Panama : The Canal, 
the Country, the People" (Macmillan), comes out 
in a new, revised, and enlarged edition, two chap- 
ters having been added since the first appearance 
of the book three years ago. These two chapters 
appropriately record the finishing of the big job 
and give a forward glance at the prospective profits 
to accrue. Of the six hundred pages in the volume, 
more than half are devoted to the history of the 
Isthmus from the earliest times, the remainder to 
researches of a more immediate and personal and 
consequently more vividly interesting character. 
Many books have been inspired by this greatest of 
engineering enterprises, but none more acceptable 
to the general reader than Mr. Bullard's well-writ- 
ten and well-illustrated volume. Seven full-page 
plates are added to the present edition, making 
more than two-score illustrations in all. 

FOREIGN TRAVEL AND DESCRIPTION. 

The best of the many excellences of Mr. F. Hop- 
kinson Smith's " In Dickens's London " (Scribner) 
is the remarkable faithfulness with which his char- 
coal drawings reproduce the smoky, dingy, but 
picturesque aspect of the great city's old and 
time-stained buildings. The peculiar griminess of 
ancient brickwork he pictures with astonishing veri- 
similitude, nor is his medium unsuited to the shad- 
owy interiors he has selected to depict. Treating 
the London of Dickens much as he did the London 
of Thackeray a year ago, he presents with pen and 
pencil the George Inn of Pickwickian fame, Lant 
Street, where Bob Sawyer had his lodgings, the 
George and Vulture, the Bull at Rochester, London 
Bridge, St. Martin's-in-the-Fields, Covent Garden 



Market, Mr. Grewgious's office in Staple Inn, and 
other Dickensian localities, with a final chapter on 
Dickens's last resting place in Westminster Abbey. 
There are twenty-two drawings, a portrait of Dick- 
ens now first published from a photograph taken 
in Philadelphia, two facsimile letters that are also 
new to the public, and other illustrative features. 
Quotations from the novelist's works, comment, and 
anecdote go to fill out the printed pages. What the 
artist-author has most enjoyed in this " labor of 
love," as he calls it, is " the expressing in another 
form and through another medium than those used 
by my fellow-craftsmen, the wonderful velvet 
blacks, soft vapory skies, and streaming silver- 
washed streets of London an easy matter for 
any enthusiast, for London is charcoal, and char- 
coal is London." 

Following in the footsteps of famous authors, 
with a camera in one hand and a pen in the other, 
is the favorite recreation of Mr. Charles S. Olcott, 
who is described as a business man with a fondness 
for artistic photography. " The Lure of the 
Camera" (Houghton) proves him to be skilful in 
this form of art, as indeed had already been demon- 
strated by his book on George Eliot's scenes and 
characters and that on Walter Scott's country. As 
in those earlier volumes, so now he rambles through 
districts immortalized in literature, visiting scenes 
associated with the names of Wordsworth, Carlyle, 
Burns, Scott, and Mrs. Humphry Ward, in Great 
Britain, and the haunts of Hawthorne, Emerson, 
Longfellow, Lowell, and others, in this country. 
"A Day with John Burroughs " is one of his most 
agreeable chapters. His views of the Yellowstone 
Park and the Grand Canon of Arizona are sugges- 
tive of the wonders of those regions, but are neces- 
sarily less satisfactory than his pictures of simpler 
scenes. His outlines of Mrs. Ward's novels, in con- 
nection with his rambles through regions familiar 
to her, are not exactly indispensable; but in gen- 
eral he comments interestingly as he pushes onward 
with his camera. 

" When I determined to set out once more to 
traverse and to possess England of my heart, it 
was part of my desire first of all to follow, as 
far as might be, in the footsteps of Chaucer's pil- 
grims. Therefore I sought the Tabard Inn in 
Southwark." Thus begins Mr. Edward Hutton in 
"England of My Heart: Spring" (Dutton) to 
be followed by the other seasons. Kent, Sussex, 
and Hants are the counties devoted to vernal con- 
templation, and the list of places visited is an 
inviting one to lovers of England's quieter haunts. 
Dartford, Rochester, Faversham, Canterbury, Chi- 
chester, Winchester, Selborne these are some of 
the names that head Mr. Hutton's pages and indi- 
cate the course of his pleasant ramble. In the 
England of his heart, " in the whole breadth of her 
delight, there is no industrial city such as infests, 
ruins, and spoils other lands, and in this she resem- 
bles her great and dear mother Italy." Why this 
ascription of maternity to Italy rather than to 
Normandy or Denmark? The Roman colonization 
of Britain was not so complete. Mr. Gordon 
Home furnishes many drawings in harmony with 
the printed matter.

Novel and promising is the plan of " The Charm 
of Scandinavia" (Little, Brown & Co.), by Dr. 
Francis E. Clark, founder of the Christian En- 
deavor Society, and his son Sydney, experienced 
travellers in the land of the Vikings. They coordi- 
nate their stores of knowledge, both book-learning 
and more immediate acquisitions, in such a manner 
as to present, first, a panorama of the many attrac- 
tions of Sweden and Finland, in letters supposed 
to have been written by one " Phillips " to a certain 
" Judicia," and then a similar view of the wonders 
and beauties of Norway and Denmark, in letters 
from "Aylmer " to the same impartial lady, who is 
asked to decide which of the two accounts reveals 
the more compelling assemblage of charms. But 
she begs to be excused, and suggests that the letters 
be published and each reader left to settle the dis- 
pute for himself. Naturally the half-tone picture 
plays a prominent part (to the extent of thirty- five 
excellent illustrations) in the book, and a map of 
Scandinavia, but not also of Finland, is usefully 
added. The style of the narrative is in admirable 
concord with its pleasing plan ; but why did not 
the authors choose as accompaniment to their ear- 
satisfying "Aylmer " and " Judicia " the classic 
and beautiful " Philip " instead of the modern and 
prosaic " Phillips " ? Further disfigurement is 
caused by the misprinting of "Aylmer " as "Aly- 
mer " in the table of contents. 

It makes the heart ache to turn the pages of 
Mr. George Wharton Edwards's beautiful volume 
on "The Forest of Arden " (Stokes), with its 
peaceful pictures of Dinant, the Meuse, the castle 
of La Roche, the valley of the Semois, and other 
haunts of unpretentious charm and innocent hap- 
piness, and to think that all this loveliness is now 
made hideous by the ravages of war. " The Ar- 
dennes," wrote the author, before the region had 
been brought into such painful prominence, "is 
comparatively an unknown country, and is likely 
to remain so." His discerning praise of the charms 
of this district, with his score and a half of excel- 
lent drawings, colored and uncolored, has a mel- 
ancholy timeliness. Much that he has captured 
with pen and pencil must by this time have suffered 
grievous disfigurement, if not utter annihilation. 
Elaborately bound and sumptuous in every detail, 
the book in its handsome box is well adapted to 
purposes of Christmas presentation. 

In the form of a narrative describing her ninth 
wedding-tour for she and " John " took one 
every year the author of " Delightful Dalmatia" 
(Funk & Wagnalls Co.) presents a sort of pano- 
ramic view, with accompanying explanatory lec- 
ture, of the eastern shore of the Adriatic, or of so 
much of it as she had the good fortune to visit in a 
summer's vacation ramble. Pola, Zara, Sebenico, 
Spalato, Ragusa, and other places of interest form 
the framework on which the fabric of interwoven 
anecdote and history and personal experience is 
hung. That Dalmatia offers so many attractions to 
the tourist will be news to more than one reader, 
and a visit to its shores in quieter times than the 
present will be felt to be desirable. A profusion of 
views from photographs, including a colored cover 
panel and a colored frontispiece, forms no small 



part of the book's attractions. The author, whose 
name appears on the title-page as "Alice Lee 
Moque," taxes the reader's credulity by giving her 
birth-year as 1888 after describing her Dalmatian 
trip as her ninth annual wedding-tour. 

With her customary admirable faculty for seeing 
the beautiful and the joyous in whatever she chooses 
to write about, Miss Lilian Whiting paints for us 
a fair and smiling city in her book, " The Lure 
of London" (Little, Brown & Co.), which opens 
with a general chapter of the same name as the 
book, and then takes us to Hyde Park Corner and 
Apsley House, the Royal Institution, the art galler- 
ies, clubs, and societies, to the sports and amuse- 
ments of the English people, to a consideration of 
" the living influence of Victorian literature," to the 
architectural and historic glories of Westminster 
Abbey, and elsewhere, ending with an essay on 
" The Spirit of London Life." In a chapter on 
"Annie Besant and the Theosophical Society," the 
priestess of occultism is treated with entire serious- 
ness by Miss Whiting, who would have us believe 
that " Mrs. Besant brings the message of the vistas 
of new life that are opening to the world in relig- 
ion, science, and art." Thirty-one good pictures 
from photographs adorn the book, which is further 
embellished on the front cover and the wrapper. 

Nine times in as many years the public demand 
for Miss Mary E. Waller's " Through the Gates of 
the Netherlands" (Little, Brown & Co.) has neces- 
sitated a new printing of the work. Its present 
appearance in flexible covers of limp leather (or 
possibly a clever imitation) and with a judicious 
selection of illustrations from the masterpieces of 
Dutch painting will be welcome to those who enjoy 
the personal, narrative, anecdotal note in their 
guide-books. Dealing with a part of Europe now 
the object of considerable public notice, it is a 
timely book, though no longer a brand-new one. Its 
attractive and handy form, as well as its pleasing 
literary style, commends it to favor. 
HOLIDAY ART BOOKS. 

Promise of something worth while is in the very 
title of "The Honest House" (Century Co.), a 
handsome book of quarto dimensions, " presenting 
examples of the usual problems which face the 
home-builder, together with an exposition of the 
simple architectural principles which underlie 
them: arranged especially in reference to small 
house design." All this wealth of material is placed 
at our disposal, the title-page tells us, "by Ruby 
Ross Goodnow in collaboration with Rayne Ad- 
ams " and with an " introduction by Frederick L. 
Ackerman, A. I. A." That the " honest house " in 
America is not invariably a thing of beauty, is 
admitted at the outset; and yet, says Mr. Acker- 
man, we may take justifiable satisfaction in our 
domestic architecture, for " there is something ex- 
pressed in the plans of the houses themselves, in 
the very arrangement of the plots of land upon 
which they stand, which differentiates them from 
similar houses of Europe. They do not express 
landlordism, but rather a group of democratic 
ideals." Successively and, one may add, success- 
fully are handled such topics as the quest of the 
ideal house, the value of the architect, American

houses and their European prototypes, the practi- 
cal problem of house-building, proportion and bal- 
ance, the useful and the beautiful, surroundings, 
color, materials, walls, roofs, column and cornice, 
porches, and so on. Examples almost without num- 
ber are presented to the eye in excellent illustra- 
tions, both machine-made and hand-made, and a 
list of other useful books of similar character is 
appended. 

German art does not hold that place in the 
world's esteem that is accorded to Italian art, to 
Dutch and Flemish art, and to other schools that 
might be named. Hence it has been less written 
about, and is less familiar to the general public. 
Mrs. Helen A. Dickinson's elaborate and scholarly 
volume, " German Masters of Art " (Stokes), helps 
to supply a manifest want, and is at the same time 
in all its details a fine example of artistic book- 
manufacture. She divides German painting into 
three schools, that of Cologne, of Swabia, and of 
Nuremberg or Franconia ; the first being character- 
ized by a certain dreamy or lyric quality, while the 
second is pre-eminently a narrative or illustrative 
art, and the third shows striking qualities of virility 
and passion and dramatic force. It is the old 
masters and not the moderns that engage Mrs. 
Dickinson's attention, and in a series of thirty-seven 
chapters, with the help of more than a hundred 
reproductions of noteworthy paintings, she ably 
introduces them to our better acquaintance. The 
quarto size of the book contributes to the satisfac- 
tory presentation of these many specimens of early 
German art to the eye, four of them being in color, 
and one hundred and ten in monotone. Finally, 
the writer's Heidelberg degree and her experience 
as university lecturer on art operate not at all 
to her disadvantage in winning her readers' confi- 
dence. 

The charm of artistic book-manufacture makes 
itself felt in "The Charm of the Antique" 
(Hearst's) by Mr. and Mrs. Robert Shackleton, 
who are experienced collectors of old furniture and 
other memorials of bygone times. They know the 
joy of acquiring for thirty-five cents a genuine 
Sheraton armchair disguised almost beyond recog- 
nition by a wadded covering of calico, and of pick- 
ing up for one lira a lion's head of iron that has 
formerly spouted water in the garden of an old 
Florentine palace. Some of their adventures in 
this species of hunting, with advice and comment 
and description such as other collectors will read 
with interest, are presented in attractive style in 
the book's score of animated and anecdotal chap- 
ters, each treating of " the charm " of some phase 
of the antique. Illustrations in lavish abundance, 
including an exquisitely colored frontispiece, adorn 
the volume and heighten the desire to become a col- 
lector if one is not already a collector, and to 
achieve fresh triumphs in the art of collecting if 
one is. The book is ornamentalty bound and neatly 
boxed. 

Few are so well versed in the arts and crafts of 
the American Indians as Mr. George Wharton 
James, who has already written with authority on 
their basket-making and other industries, and now 
presents an historical and descriptive account of 



"Indian Blankets and Their Makers" (McClurg), 
with excellent colored pictures of their work, and a 
great number of uncolored pictures. How deft and 
ingenious our aborigines were in the textile arts is 
known to comparatively few; but the expert in 
such matters dare to assert that there is nothing in 
modern weaving that will not be found anticipated 
in such fragments of matting and blankets and 
other fabrics as have been exhumed from Indian 
graves that were centuries old when Columbus was 
born. Mr. James's book, a quarto of more than 
two hundred pages, is the painstaking work of one 
more desirous of giving full and exact information 
than of achieving originality. Twenty-two chap- 
ters and four appended papers present the results 
of his researches. He uses, wisely enough, the still 
uncommon word "Amerind " to denote the Amer- 
ican Indian, and he does well also to prefer the 
spelling " Navaho " to its Spanish equivalent. The 
Navaho blanket, it may be noted, forms the main 
theme of his treatise. The beauty and softness of 
some of these products of the Navaho loom, as pic- 
tured in the book, are remarkable. 

" Some people collect old furniture, some old 
books. I for many years have been a collector of 
old houses." Thus writes Mr. John Martin Ham- 
mond, author of " Colonial Mansions of Maryland 
and Delaware" (Lippincott), a sumptuous octavo 
containing historical accounts and fine illustrations 
of nearly two-score eighteenth-century houses, 
largely in the region about Baltimore, the author's 
home, whence with camera and a pair of intelli- 
gently observant eyes he sallies occasionally forth 
on his collecting expeditions. His assortment of 
historic houses such as the Chase, the Hammond, 
the Brice, and the Ridout houses of Annapolis, the 
Ratcliffe Manor, Whitehall, Hampton, Mount Airy, 
Belvoir, and Montmorenci shows that he has 
wisely given his attention to the near rather than to 
the remote. The outlying sections of Maryland are 
but little represented in his book, and Delaware 
occupies hardly a sixth of its bulk. There are 
others of our Atlantic States that can show houses 
of earlier construction, notably Massachusetts with 
her examples of seventeenth-century domestic archi- 
tecture, but Maryland has preserved her old houses 
more carefully than some other members of the 
colonial sisterhood. " Much of the available data," 
says Mr. Hammond (as if " data " were a singular 
noun), " of the history of Maryland and Delaware 
will be found in the voluminous writings of John 
Thomas Scharff," to whom and to others he pays 
due acknowledgment. 

HOLIDAY EDITIONS OF STANDARD LITERATURE. 

An old favorite among book-illustrators is Gold- 
smith's masterpiece, " The Vicar of Wakefield." In 
a substantial quarto richly illustrated by Mr. Ed- 
mund J. Sullivan the immortal story is now offered

teen colored pictures of sufficient brightness and 
variety of hue to please those who like this sort of

smaller designs as chapter-headings. To add that 
the book is printed at the Edinburgh University

Press will be commendation enough of its typo- 
graphical excellence. It is bound in blue and gold, 
and is well boxed. 

Mr. Henry De Vere Stacpoole's metrical versions 
of Villon's poems, already known to the English 
public, appear from the house of the John Lane 
Company in a generously margined, handsomely 
printed volume, entitled " The Poems of Francois 
Villon," and defined as to contents by a prelim- 
inary note : " The two Testaments of Frangois 
Villon with a running commentary and notes, also 
the ballades of the Grand Testament translated into 
English with a translation of various Ballades and 
Rondeaux from the general poems." A short 
treatise on Villon and his times precedes the poems. 
" God made him a robber, it is true," admits his 
translator and admirer, " but at least let us thank 
God that He did not make him a tradesman." Fur- 
ther, he pronounces Villon " the greatest and truest 
of French verse- writers," and " the only French 
poet who is entirely real." Mr. Stacpoole's faith- 
fulness to the original sometimes proves harmful to 
the smoothness of his own verse, but that is better 
than too great freedom of rendering. An appen- 
dix contains the French text of the ballads and 
rondeaux. 

With no fewer than eight able competitors al- 
ready in the field, Mr. Ernest J. B. Kirtlan essays a 
new translation of " Beowulf " (Crowell) . English 
prose, with but a hint of archaism in its structure 
and vocabulary, is the medium chosen; and the 
result is an agreeably readable and apparently 
faithful rendering of the Anglo-Saxon a version 
more quickly intelligible to most readers than the 
somewhat labored poetic translation of Morris and 
Wyatt. Introduction, footnotes, and appended 
matter show that Mr. Kirtlan is not lacking in 
scholarly preparation for his task. Mr. Frederic 
Lawrence contributes a colored frontispiece and 
decorative initials and cover-design. 

A thin-paper, flexibly bound, gilt-edged edition 
of that excellent anthology, " Golden Poems," com- 
piled by the late Francis Fisher Browne, comes 
from the McClurg publishing house. First issued 
in 1881, and again published in an enlarged form 
in 1906, the book has not failed of an appreciative 
reception. That it is no mere piece of book- 
making, no perfunctory putting together of passa- 
ble material, those well know who remember Mr. 
Browne's fondness for these carefully chosen 
poems and his astonishing ability to repeat them 
from memory. They number nearly five hundred, 
and are from both British and American poets. 
Tables of contents, of authors, and of first lines are 
given, and previous errors of printing are cor- 
rected. In its new form the book is a most invit- 
ing pocket volume. 

In a five- volume, thin-paper edition, embellished 
with the original illustrations, Mr. Clifton John- 
son's set of Thoreau's chief works comes neatly 
boxed and in every respect suitable for Christmas 
purchase and Christmas gift. The books, in the 
order in which Mr. Johnson first gave them forth, 
are " Cape Cod," " The Maine Woods," "Walden," 
"A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers," 
and " Excursions." Emerson's biographical sketch 



of his naturalist friend is prefixed to the selections 
grouped under the last-named title; introductions 
by Mr. Johnson are to be found in the other vol- 
umes. The publishers (Thomas Y. Crowell Co.) 
call this a pocket edition, as in fact it is, though 
in the spacious typography of the original larger 
issue. 

Mr. Arthur Rackham's name as illustrator of 
Shakespeare's " Midsummer Night's Dream " (Dou- 
bleday) is adequate warrant for the excellence of 
the elaborate quarto edition of the mirthful fan- 
tasy, issued this season in a cheaper, more popular, 
form. So generously spaced as to run to the length 
of one hundred and thirty-four pages, the play is 
lavishly illustrated both with full page drawings, 
colored and uncolored, and with smaller designs 
scattered through the text. Mr. Rackham's render- 
ings of the Puckish conceits so abundantly supplied 
to him are admirable, and the delicate tinting of his 
colored drawings is in agreeable contrast with the 
more garish pictures that coruscate in so many of 
the books designed to make glad the holiday season. 
To the Ballantyne Press credit is due for the excel- 
lent typography of this work, and the Hentschel 
Colour-type Process has demonstrated its efficiency 
in reproducing the artist's conceptions. 
RECORDS OF THE PAST. 

Student wit and student pranks enter inevitably 
and very acceptably into the truthful chronicle of 
the fortunes of any typical American college. The 
part played by the undergraduates in moulding the 
history and fixing the character of their Alma 
Mater is no negligible factor. Mr. Wilder Dwight 
Quint makes the student body as well as the faculty 
and the trustees fill important roles in his book, 
" The Story of Dartmouth " (Little, Brown & Co.), 
a production similar in style and scope to Mr. 
Arthur Stanwood Pier's readable account of Har- 
vard, which came from the same publishing house 
a year ago. As in that work, pencil drawings from 
a skilful hand in this instance the artist is Mr. 
John Albert Seaford are not unwisely chosen in- 
stead of photographic views to present to the eye 
some of the more noted academic features described 
or mentioned by the pen. From its foundation in 
1770, through the critical period made famous by 
the great Dartmouth Case and Webster's memor- 
able plea for the college, down to the present time, 
Mr. Quint lovingly and with scholarly care traces 
the history of this pre-eminently American or 
" national " college, as its graduates and friends 
like to call it and its claim to the title is not 
unfounded, since it draws more students from out- 
side New Hampshire than does Harvard (the col- 
lege proper) from outside Massachusetts. Both the 
educator and the general reader will enjoy Mr. 
Quint's book. Additions to the series are likely to 
receive a welcome. 

In his Preface to his third book on the metropolis 
of England, Sir Laurence Gomme explains wherein 
it differs from the preceding two. " The Govern- 
ance of London " had to do with " a newly discov- 
ered aspect of the question of origins," and " The 
Making of London " concerned itself with applying 
" the results of this study to the evolution of the 
city," while in " London " (Lippincott) the author

claims " to have discovered the great fact of his- 
torical continuity, conscious and effective conti- 
nuity, underlying the main issues of London life 
throughout all its changes." Freeman and his fol- 
lowers have proved that the conquest of Britain 
resulted in the dominance of English government, 
language, and institutions generally ; but Sir Lau- 
rence contends that one need not therefore conclude 
that in no spot in England are there any survivals 
from pre-English times. London, in his study of 
it, is rich in such survivals. Whatever may be the 
soundness or the unsoundness of his theories, the 
book is a monument to his antiquarian research and 
at the same time a novel and interesting treatment 
of an inexhaustible theme. Portraits, old prints, 
ancient coins and implements, historic ruins, maps 
and charts, have been freely drawn upon for illus- 
trating the volume, which is handsomely printed at 
Edinburgh in the full-faced type that we associate 
with Scottish presses. 

Our old colonial houses, though but infants in 
comparison with the historic mansions and baro- 
nial halls of England, are nevertheless extremely 
interesting to us and especially pleasing by way of 
contrast with much that is more pretentious and 
far less attractive in modern domestic architecture. 
Miss Mary H. Northend's " Historic Homes of New 
England " (Little, Brown & Co.) describes and pic- 
tures a score of the most noteworthy of these old 
dwellings in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, 
with one in Rhode Island. They are the House of 
Seven Gables and the Pickering house in Salem; 
the Hooper house, known as The Lindens, at Dan- 
vers; the Rogers house, at Peabody; the Jeremiah 
Lee house, Marblehead; Ladd-Gilman house. Exe- 
ter; Adams house, Newbury; the Spencer Pierce 
and the Dalton houses, Newburyport ; Dummer 
mansion, Byfield; Warner house, Portsmouth; 
Wentworth house, Little Harbor; Franklin Pierce 
house, Hillsboro ; Savory house, Groveland ; Stark 
mansion, Dunbarton ; Saltonstall house, Haverhill ; 
Kittredge house, Andover ; Roy all house, Medf ord ; 
Longfellow house, Cambridge; Quincy mansion, 
Quincy; and Middleton house, Bristol. Good views 
of exterior and interior abound, and the ornate 
cover shows the famous seven-gable structure in 
gilt. The historical and descriptive text gives 
evidence of care and thoroughness. A novel deriva- 
tion catches the eye, " clapboard " from " clay- 
board," because the houses first finished in this man- 
ner were daubed with clay before receiving the 
boards now known as clapboards. 

It is a quarter-century since Andrew Lang, some- 
time fellow of Merton College, Oxford, delighted 
his brother Oxonians and many others with his 
historical and descriptive notes on the famous old 
university. That book, with its numerous exquisite 
drawings by Mr. Joseph Pennell, R. Kent Thomas, 
A. Brunet-Debaines, and others, is probably no 
longer easily obtainable; hence the acceptability of 
a new edition with what will be to many modern 
readers equally attractive and even more attractive 
illustrations in the colored plates of Mr. George F. 
Carline, R.B.A. " Oxford " (Lippincott) now ap- 
pears in crown quarto form, printed at the Edin- 
burgh University Press in large type on Arnold 



hand-made paper, and limited in its issue to three 
hundred and fifty copies. Turning these pages 
from the versatile pen of "Andrew of the brindled 
hair," one may perchance feel an increased interest 
in the venerable buildings they describe from the 
possibility, not inconceivably remote at present 
writing, that some such disaster as lately befell 
Louvain may one day be the lot of Oxford. Many 
curious anecdotes, traditional or historical, enliven 
these chapters, which, despite the antiquity of their 
theme, are brisk with life and color. 

Very successful has Miss Mary Caroline Craw- 
ford been in imparting an early Yankee flavor to 
the pages of her " Social Life in New England " 
(Little, Brown & Co.), which displays on a some- 
what broader canvas the same kind of char- 
acters and incidents as in her former works on 
" Old Boston Days and Ways " and " Romantic 
Days in Old Boston." Her matter is grouped un- 
der such chapter-headings as " In the Little Red 
Schoolhouse," " Going to College," " Choosing 
a Profession," " Getting Married," " Setting up 
Housekeeping," " Reading Books," and "Amuse- 
ments of the Big Town." The material for these 
studies is not meagre, as her Preface makes evident, 
and she has put it to good use. Illustrative of old- 
time moral standards are the penalties imposed at 
Harvard for various misdemeanors a century and 
three-quarters ago. Profane language was punish- 
able by a fine that might reach a maximum of two 
shillings and sixpence, whereas drunkenness and 
lying would each cost the offender not more than 
one shilling and sixpence. Miss Crawford uses the 
name Massachusetts when she must mean either the 
Bay Colony or the Plymouth Colony, as the two 
were not consolidated until 1692. For instance, she 
says, " Massachusetts established schools by law in 
1642." Her picture of " the last of the farm boys 
and his pair of oxen " might tempt an old New 
Englander to draw his pen through " pair " and 
substitute " yoke." In lavish illustrative features 
the book is not inferior to its predecessors. 

Based largely on Washington's own diaries and 
letters, as made available to students in recent 
years, Mr. Frederick Trevor Hill's " Washington 
the Man of Action " (Appleton) is a trustworthy, 
straightforward, succinct account of our foremost 
national hero, and, as its dedication "to the boys 
of the Alf Club " shows, is designed for young 
readers. Indeed, its quarto form, great primer 
type, abundant colored pictures, and other striking 
features place it at once in the juvenile class ; and 
though one might almost say that the book weighs 
half as much as some of the readers for whom it is 
intended, it is likely to please them none the less 
for that. Comte J. Onfroy de Breville (" Job ") 
furnishes the illustrations, which will be found not 
deficient in life and action and color. 

Anecdotal and sufficiently tinged with romance, 
"The Man Napoleon" (Crowell), by Mr. William 
Henry Hudson, justifies its addition to the thou- 
sand already existing accounts of the great Corsican 
by its engaging style and by the well-conceived and 
elaborately executed colored drawings, by Baron 
Myrbach, that accompany the reading matter. The 
writing of such a book is the more remarkable be-

THE DIAL, 



[Dec. 1 



cause its author both explicitly and implicitly dis- 
claims admiration for the " colossal image with 
feet of clay " whom he so interestingly places be- 
fore us. Material, more or less trustworthy, is of 
course available in abundance for an intimate 
study like this; the chief merit of Mr. Hudson's 
book is its combination of impartiality with vivid 
interest a blend not common in biography. 

HOLIDAY FICTION. 

Bright and sunny, whimsical and humorous, and 
not lacking in the element of romance, Mr. Mere- 
dith Nicholson's story of " The Poet " (Hough ton) 
is likely to win him new friends while attaching to 
him more warmly the old ones. In geniality of 
manner and wisdom of life the book shows decided 
advance over his earlier works of fiction. Obvious 
to the discerning reader is the Poet's strong resem- 
blance to the author's fellow Hoosier, Mr. James 
Whitcomb Riley, undoubtedly the model after 
whom the gentle and lovable hero of the tale is 
patterned. Appropriately enough, the Poet's child 
friend, Marjorie, the rather pathetic sufferer from 
her parents' mutual uncongeniality, plays a promi- 
nent part in the story ; and his kind offices as peace- 
maker, also his wise and friendly aid to a young 
brother poet, and with it all his interest in others' 
affairs of the heart, while he himself remains but an 
on-looker at the game of love, are so handled by the 
author as to invest his amiable hero with an increas- 
ing charm. Marjorie's infant dialect is rather over- 
done and wearisome; otherwise the characters are 
wholly pleasing. The book is provided with cheer- 
ful colored pictures and tinted decorations. 

Betty was a girl with a splendid dowry, " youth, 
health, gaiety of heart, an indomitable spirit, and a 
pair of the softest, loveliest, most misleading dark 
eyes that were ever seen." So she is described by 
Miss Molly Elliot Seawell in " Betty's Virginia 
Christmas " (Lippincott) , wherein also her love for 
Lieutenant John Hope Fortescue, U. S. A., and the 
happy issue of that romance, are narrated. The 
antepenultimate chapter, headed, with unnecessary 
disregard for orthodox orthography, "Recom- 
pence," brings the lovers to the exchange of vows in 
good earnest, and the following chapter, joyously 
entitled " Gloria," sees them safely married, with 
one chapter still remaining in which to gather up 
the loose threads. As in her other novels, the writer 
shows her artistry in depicting southern scenes and 
characters, the local color including, of course, that 
of the negro as well as the brighter hues of Betty's 
complexion. It is a good, wholesome Christmas 
tale, illustrated with unusual wealth of colored pic- 
tures and outline drawings. 

Miss Zona Gale's short stories of Friendship Vil- 
lage have won favor with readers, and such a collec- 
tion of these tales from her pen as now appears 
under the title, "Neighborhood Stories" (Mac- 
millan), is assured of a welcome. The frank and 
fearless Calliope Marsh is supposed to be the nar- 
rator throughout; and she is certainly a character 
worth knowing, and her vigorous speech is worth 
listening to. "When I die," is one of Calliope's 
utterances, " don't you get anybody that's always 
treated me like a dog and put them on the front 



seat. Make 'em sit back." Miss Gale believes in 
" a Romance of Life as much finer than sentimen- 
tality as modern romance is saner than chivalry," 
and it is this wholesome romance that is now dawn- 
ing upon Friendship Village. If you wish to learn 
more about it, read the " Neighborhood Stories " of 
Calliope Marsh. The book is ornately bound and 
has a frontispiece showing a group of Friendship 
Village faces. 

Published under the auspices of the California 
Writers' Club, " West Winds " is described on its 
title-page as " California's book of fiction, written 
by California authors and illustrated by California 
artists." It is also, of course, published by a Cali- 
fornia publishing house, that of Messrs. Paul 
Elder & Co., San Francisco. Mr. Herman Whita- 
ker is the California editor, as he is also the author 
of one of the stories, the first of the series. The 
other writers, as their names stand in the table of 
contents, are as follows : Elizabeth Abbey Everett, 
Shirley A. Mansfield, Sarah Thurston Nott, Agnes 
Morley Cleaveland, Rebecca N. Porter, Julia B. 
Foster, Charles F. Lummis, Jack London, Hester 
A. Dickinson, Elizabeth Griswold Rowe, Frances 
Orr Allen, Mrs. Carl Bank, Harriet Holmes Has- 
lett, and Torrey Connor. The " spread of life," as 
the editor of the book says in his Preface, extends 
from Old Mexico to 'Alaska; and the characters 
include swarthy Mexicans, Gringoes, bandits and 
peons, miners and mule-drivers, and all the varied 
types of that far-western wonderland. The pic- 
tures, in sepia-brown, harmonize with the general 
color-scheme of the book, as also with the spirit of 
the text they illustrate. Not all new to print, the 
tales are none the less full of novel interest and 
show the California standard of short-story-writing 
to be a high one. 

A slight thing, but not inferior to her more elabo- 
rate works of fiction, the story called " The Hands 
of Esau" (Harper), by Mrs. Margaret Deland, 
illustrates with vividness and pathos the inescapa- 
ble influence of heredity. How Tom Vail, a con- 
vict's son, wooed and won Nina Morgan, and then 
what happened, will be read with no languid inter- 
est by Mrs. Deland's many admirers. It impresses 
one as a bit of tragic reality from the very heart of 
life. Two good illustrations and an ornamental 
binding set off the excellences of the well-told story. 

In amplified form and with realistic touches and 
suitable embellishment, Dr. Henry Van Dyke tells 
in his own pleasing fashion the story related much 
more briefly in the last dozen verses of the second 
chapter of St. Luke. " The Lost Boy" (Harper) 
is a suitable book for a Christmas gift or for 
Sunday-school use. A picture of the child Jesus in 
the temple, surrounded by the elders, precedes the 
narrative, and the cover and wrapper are also 
appropriately adorned by the artist. 

A warm welcome from those seeking Christmas 
gift books is assured for the " Ooze Leather Christ- 
mas Series," published by Messrs. Browne & How- 
ell Co., in ten little volumes bound in soft, flexible 
leather. The stories have been chosen from excel- 
lent sources and are not only brightly attractive 
but also peculiarly appropriate to the season. 
They comprise " Santa Glaus and Little Billee," by

MISCELLANEOUS HOLIDAY BOOKS. 

The fascinations of book-collecting took captive 
Mr. Percy Fitzgerald when he was but a boy; and 
later, the charm having lost nothing of its potency, 
he wrote understandingly and well about first edi- 
tions, unique copies, early printers, curious bind- 
ings, and similar bibliological topics. This season 
brings forth a neat edition of his work, first pub- 
lished in 1886, called " The Book Fancier; or, The 
Romance of Book Collecting " (Lippincott) . With 
some lack of entire frankness, the date originally 
appended to the preface is omitted, as if to convey 
the impression of a new work, whereas it is a nearly 
exact reprint, in larger type and with almost iden- 
tical pagination, of the first edition. Exactness of 
reproduction has been slightly departed from in the 
chapter headings, several of which are a little short- 
ened. The book, as some will recall, treats of col- 
lectors and dealers, the Mazarin Bible, incunabula, 
Elzevirs, Plantins, Caxtons, and old printers of 
both England and the Continent, libraries, curiosi- 
ties of printing and binding, Grangerizing, and 
Dickensiana, illustrated books and " luxurious " 
editions, the auction room, and Shakespeare folios 
and quartos. Speaking of the difficulties of book- 
classification, the author asks, choosing an absurdly 
simple problem in cataloguing, not in classification, 
and making a curious choice of auxiliary verb : 
" Would we enter ' Coningsby,' for instance, under 
Disraeli or Beaconsfield ? " Undoubtedly this enter- 
tainingly bookish book from the variously gifted 
Mr. Fitzgerald's prolific pen deserved the honor of 
a handsome new edition. 

A good collection of inscriptions, mottoes, place- 
names, sententious utterances, and similar bits of 
prose and verse, has been compiled by Miss Esther 
Matson, with the title, "A Book of Inscriptions " 
(McBride). Its contents are grouped under three 
heads, " Much Ado about the Place Name," 
" Mottoes for Hearth and Garth," and "Accompani- 
ments for Gifts," with an " Ende-Word " in the 
form of an old house-blessing of unknown author- 
ship. The selections are from both ancient and 
modern sources, and will be found to include many 
unhackneyed mottoes that are just as good as the 
time-worn and familiar. Dr. Holmes's " Put not 
your trust in money, but put your money in trust," 
might well be inscribed over the door of a banking 
house or trust company. Miss Matson puts it in a 
section devoted to " little homely things." Her 
dining-room mottoes fail to include the French say- 
ing, " II n'est sauce que d'appetit," though else- 
where in her book she draws freely on foreign 
sources. Her scholarly little volume seems likely to 



supply a want in its department, especially with 
those who at this season are hunting for the proper 
" sentiment " to go with the Christmas gift. 

Stimulating, as its name would indicate, is Mr. 
Richard Wightman's " Soul-Spur" (Century Co.), 
a book as sure to win favor as it is certain that 
everyone is eager to know more about the half- 
hidden things of his own life and his own soul. 
Observation, reflection, intuition, friendly counsel, 
apt illustration of these is the book compounded, 
and in some of its bracing and wholesome utter- 
ances and admonitions it suggests Emerson, from 
whom indeed it fittingly quotes. Here is a sample 
of the author's style : " It is good to do little essen- 
tial things with a hot heart, to tend small tasks with 
a fine zeal which makes the seemingly insignificant 
employment big and important. In an inn at 
Savoy there was a flight of stone stairs. They 
were very dirty stairs. They had apparently not 
been washed since the first man went up them. 
John Ruskin saw them and the sight smote his soul 
into indignation. Straightway he procured a 
bucket and a broom and scrubbed the stairs pains- 
takingly. Was he less an artist for this menial 
service? . . . Fundamental fidelities are the par- 
ents of art." These chapters on the common but 
supremely important things of life are introduced 
each by a sententious bit of original verse, except 
in one instance where prose is used. 

More fertile in new words than even the immor- 
tal author of " Jabberwocky," Mr. Gelett Burgess 
feels it incumbent on him to be his own glossarist. 
Hence we have " Burgess Unabridged : A New 
Dictionary of Words You Have Always Needed" 
(Stokes), appropriately and ludicrously illustrated 
by Mr. Herbert Roth (if that be the polite desig- 
nation of "Herb Roth"), and warranted by the 
author to " solidify the chinks of conversation, ex- 
press the inexpressible, make our English language 
ornamental, elegant, distinguished, accurate." One 
hundred new words and their derivatives are alpha- 
betically arranged, with explanations and illustra- 
tions in prose and verse, and with pictures to help 
out the text where needed. Mr. Burgess modestly 
omits his past triumphs in word-making, such as 
" bromide " and " goop," and concerns himself only 
with " the words of to-morrow." He who would 
acquire " spuzz," learn the art of " tashivation," 
avoid the danger of becoming a " jirriwig " or a 
" leolump," and escape the clutches of the " vorian- 
der," should carry in his pocket and daily study 
" Burgess Unabridged." 

The publications of the firm of Messrs. Paul 
Elder & Co. have an attractiveness of form, a 
distinction of design, that induce high hopes of 
excellence in the reading matter; nor have these 
hopes often been disappointed. Miss Myrtle Glenn 
Roberts's idealistic drama, " The Foot of the Rain- 
bow," combines beauty of outward appearance, in 
its tinted Normandy vellum pages and neatness of 
print and binding, with merits of a higher order in 
its thought and expression. With a rural setting 
and with farming people as the characters, the old 
story of chasing the rainbow for the blessings that 
lie immediately at hand is told with dramatic force 
and poetic imagery. It is a parable in dramatic 



464 



THE DIAJL 



[ Dec. 1 



form hardly suited for the professional stage, from 
a business point of view, but well fitted for recital 
or amateur acting. 

Two more are added to Mr. Oliver Huckel's 
Wagner translations, " Rienzi " and " The Flying 
Dutchman " (Crowell). Though latest in the order 
of issue in this series, these operas were among the 
earliest in the order of creation, being produced at 
Dresden in 1842 and 1843 respectively; and it was 
"Rienzi" that established its author's reputation 
as a composer. Mr. Huckel's metre, with the excep- 
tion of occasional songs that vary the monotony, is 
blank verse at once flexible and strong, spirited 
and sufficiently stately. Three photogravures in 
tint accompany each opera, and a good historical 
and critical Introduction is provided for each by 
the translator. Mr. Huckel's skill and taste in this 
chosen work of his have already been recognized in 
the nine preceding numbers of the series. Printing 
and ornamentation are in harmony with the other 
excellences of these attractive volumes. 

Indefatigable in "her work of collecting and edit- 
ing in popular form the folklore of our Indian 
tribes, Miss Katharine B. Judson has issued a third 
volume of these native legends under the title, 
" Myths and Legends of the Mississippi Valley and 
the Great Lakes" (McClurg), with pictures show- 
ing examples of Indian graphic and industrial arts. 
The stories are all short and of the simple and 
childish nature peculiar to such primitive exercises 
of the imagination, with animals playing important 
parts in most of them. Many of the Hiawatha 
legends are given in their original crude form, while 
other myths present curious points of resemblance 
to the folklore of the Old World. Stories of the 
creation and the flood are especially noteworthy in 
this respect, though missionary influence is doubt- 
less accountable for many if not most of these simi- 
larities. But no such suggestion is to be found in 
the mass of these primitive attempts to explain the 
phenomena of the universe. The pioneer labors of 
Mr. Albert E. Jenks among the wild-rice Indians of 
the upper lakes, of Mr. James Mooney among the 
Cherokees, of Mr. George Catlin among the tribes 
of the upper Mississippi, and of Schoolcraft in his 
noted ethnological researches, are placed under con- 
tribution by Miss Judson, with due acknowledg- 
ments in her Preface. 

Seventeen heroines of song and story are passed 
in review by Miss Mary C. Sturgeon in a handsome 
volume entitled " Women of the Classics " ( Crow- 
ell). Seven of these characters are taken from 
Homer, three from JEsehylus, two from Sophocles, 
four from Euripides, and one, the sorrowful Dido, 
from Virgil. In descriptive prose of her own and 
in standard metrical versions from the above-named 
poets, Miss Sturgeon presents her heroines and 
gives to each a personality and a history that make 
them more distinct and real than they have hitherto 
been in the minds of most readers. Some unusually 
good reproductions of more or less famous paint- 
ings offer the same classic heroines to the eye 
with the single exception of lo, whose form and 
features are left to the imagination. The book, 
printed at the Ballantyne Press, is a work of art, 



its only blemish being the unutilitarian stiffness 
and consequent fragility of its binding. 

Told from the standpoint of an American born 
and resident in China, as the publisher's announce- 
ment informs us, the seven stories or sketches that 
make up the contents of " Bamboo : Tales of the 
Orient-Born " (Elder) are genuinely far-eastern in 
tone, and leave in the reader's mind no doubt of 
their trustworthiness as pictures of the Orient. 
The author's name appears on the title-page as 
" Lyon Sharman," and internal evidence favors the 
hypothesis that Lyon Sharman is a woman and the 
daughter of an American missionary. In style the 
little sketches have distinction, and their occasional 
autobiographic note contributes to their charm. 
Distinction, too, is not absent from the book's out- 
v/ard appearance. 

Mr. Franklin P. Adams, of well-earned fame as 
a smile-producer with his neat bits of humorous 
verse (and occasionally prose) in newspapers and 
magazines, gathers some of his happiest hits into 
a little volume entitled " By and Large " (Double- 
day). His opening group of jingles, suggested by 
passages from Horace, Catullus, and Propertius, 
are bright and amusing; and he continues to be 
entertaining when he writes entirely " off his own 
bat," if one may be allowed a colloquialism not at 
discord with the style of the book under review. 
John G. Saxe, in the good old days, rarely did bet- 
ter work in jocular rhymes than this later dis- 
peller of our melancholic humours shows himself 
capable of. " By and Large " is a worthy succes- 
sor to " Toboganning on Parnassus " and " In 
Other Words." 

Among the numerous anthological calendars ap- 
pearing at this season to remind us pleasantly of 
the opening of another year, a popular favorite is 
likely to be "The William J. Locke Calendar" 
(Lane), a tastefully made little book with an ex- 
tract from the author of " Septimus " for each day 
in the year, so selected and arranged by Miss Emma 
M. Pope as to give about four of these pearls of 
thought to the page, but with little attempt to make 
each fit especially into its part of the entire string. 
But the passages are characteristic of their author, 
and seem to be carefully and wisely chosen. 

Five tasteful volumes, of pocket size and in good 
print on good paper and also surprisingly inex- 
pensive in price contain selections of standard 
patriotic poems, love poems, sonnets, poems on 
sport, and religious poems. " Oxford Garlands " 
is the series-title, Mr. R. M. Leonard the compiler, 
and the imprint is that of the Oxford University 
Press. Each volume has a preface, appended notes, 
an index of authors, and an index of first lines. To 
poetry-lovers these little volumes are a treasure. 

Mr. George Fitch's original and unexpected way 
of putting things is agreeably known to thousands 
of newspaper readers, whom his little syndicated 
snatches of passing comment have daily amused 
for the past three years. A collection of these 
"vestpocket essays (not especially serious)" now 
appears in book form, under the title, " Sizing up 
Uncle Sam" (Stokes). Its "Map of the United 
States, surveyed by George Fitch," is not the least 
of its amusing features.

M. Remain Holland's " Musicians of To-day " 
will be issued at once by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. 

Mr. Byam Shaw has drawn illustrations in color 
for an edition of Laurence Hope's " India's Love 
Lyrics " which is announced by the John Lane Co. 

General von Bernhardi's latest book has been 
translated by Mr. J. Ellis Barker, and will be pub- 
lished under the title of " Britain as Germany's 
Vassal." 

A group of war poems by Mr. Richard Le Gal- 
lienne is to be published by the John Lane Co., 
under the title of one of them, " The Silk Hat 
Soldier." 

A special edition of Sir J. M. Barrie's " The 
Admirable Crichton," with illustrations in color by 
Mr. Hugh Thompson, is announced by Messrs. 
George H. Doran Co. for holiday publication. 

Alphonse Courlander, one of the younger En- 
glish novelists of promise, died last month in 
France. He was the author of five novels; the 
last, and best known, was a study of " the fourth 
estate " in London and Paris under the title of 
" Mightier than the Sword." 

A two-volume work by General von Bernhardi, 
" On War of To-day," is announced by Messrs. 
Dodd, Mead & Co. It is said to be the general 
basis from which he developed the other smaller 
books on specific aspects of war and militarism 
which have attracted so much attention in the last 
three months. The translation is the work of a 
lieutenant in the German army. 

Four volumes of the " University of Chicago 
Science Series " are now in press. They are : 
Professor Thomas C. Chamberlin's " The Origin of 
the Earth," Professor John Merle Coulter's " The 
Evolution of Sex in Plants," Professor Robert A. 
Millikan's " The Isolation and Measurement of tha 
Electron," and Professor Hans Blichfeldt's " The 
Theory of Collineation Groups." 

Four essays are to be added to " The Art and 
Craft of Letters Series " as previously announced. 
They are : " Criticism," by Mr. P. P." Howe ; 
"Parody," by Mr. Christopher Stone"; "The 
Ballad," by Mr. Frank Sidgwick; and "Punctua- 
tion," by Mr. Filson Young. Mr. Young is also 
the author of a volume of essays, soon to be pub- 
lished under the title of " New Leaves." 

A series of Treitschke's writings translated from 
the German is announced by Messrs. G. P. Put- 
nam's Sons for immediate publication. " Selec- 
tions from Heinrich von Treitschke," a group of 
lectures on politics translated into English, will be 
published this month by Messrs. Frederick A. 
Stokes Co. This house will also publish Mr. 
Joseph McCabe's book, " Treitschke and the Great 
War." 

Mr. Bernard Shaw is the author of " Common 
Sense about the War," a book that has just been 
published in London as a thirty-two page supple- 
ment to " The New Statesman," the London 
weekly paper in which, with Mr. and Mrs. Sidney 
Webb, he has been interested as a founder. This 



paper, by the way, is authority for the statement 
that the long-awaited final volume of Mr. Arnold 
Bennett's trilogy is one-third completed and is 
already entitled " These Twain." 

Among the new volumes to be issued immedi- 
ately in the cheaper edition of " Bohn's Popular 
Library" are: More's "Utopia," with an Introduc- 
tion by Mr. A. Guthkelch; the Aldine edition of 
Keats, with the addition of the poems recently 
published for the first time in the London 
" Times" ; Coleridge's " Lectures and Notes on 
Shakespeare and Other English Poets " ; the third 
and fourth volumes of Lane's "Arabian Nights " ; 
and the first and second volumes of Plutarch's 
" Lives," translated by Mr. A. Stewart and Mr. 
George Long. 

Among the volumes which the American-Scan- 
dinavian Foundation has in preparation are: 
" Lyrics by Bjornson " ; " Essays by Kierke- 
gaard " ; " Three Modern Icelandic Dramas " ; 
" The Prose Edda of Snorri Sturluson " ; " Danish 
Popular Ballads " ; " The Book of Little Brother," 
by Gustaf af Geijerstam; "Marie Grubbe," by 
J. P. Jacobsen ; Ibsen's " Brand " ; and " Master 
Olof," an historical drama in five acts by August 
Strindberg. In addition the Foundation will pub- 
lish a series of " Scandinavian Monographs " on 
Northern literature, history, and life. 

A volume of Miss Mitford's letters has been 
edited, with an Introduction, by Miss Elizabeth 
Lee and will be published under the title of " Mary 
Russell Mitford: Correspondence with Charles 
Boner and John Ruskin." The letters to Ruskin 
were written in the years 1852-4, and are now 
printed for the first time. Miss Mitford's impres- 
sions of Mrs. Browning, Charles Kingsley, Na- 
thaniel Hawthorne, and Mr. and Mrs. Cobden are 
recorded in these letters, in addition to her reflec- 
tions on the first appearance of Tennyson's " The 
Princess," of Macaulay's " History of England," 
of Charlotte Bronte's novels, and of Matthew 
Arnold's poems. 

Dr. Ewald Fliigel, head of the department of 
English philology at Leland Stanford Jr. Uni- 
versity since 1892, who died on November 15, will 
be remembered by readers of THE DIAL as a con- 
tributor whose scholarship made his articles of 
unique value. Dr. Fliigel was born in Leipzig, 
Germany, on August 4, 1863, and was a student at 
the Universities of Freiburg and Leipzig from 
1882 to 1888. He received the degree of Ph.D. 
from the University of Leipzig in 1885. Dr. 
Fltigel was an honorary member of the Akadem 
Neuphilologische Verein, Leipzig, and of the Ver- 
ein fiir Neuere Philologie, Dresden. He was a 
member of the American Philological Association, 
of the Early English Text Society, the Chaucer 
Society, and the Goethe Gesellschaft, Weimar. 
Among Dr. Fliigel's publications are : " Carlyle's 
religiose und sittliche Entwickelung," " Sidney's 
'Astrophel' and 'Defense of Poesy,'" and "Die 
Nordamerikanische Litteratur." Dr. Fliigel's com- 
pilation of the Chaucer dictionary planned and 
originated by the late Dr. Furnivall, which had 
proceeded as far as the letter " H," is ended by his 
death.

The Neigh hours 

By Zona Gale 




In Hospital 

By Thomas H. 
Dickinson 



Glory of the Morning 

By William Ellery Leonard 

THE themes and treatment vary widely and 
each play is characteristic of its author. 
Miss Gale is represented by her well- 
known rural types in a simple, moving yet 
humorous -^-episode. Mr. Dickinson builds an 
effective drama around the tense moment dur- 
ing which a husband awaits the results of the 
operation which is being performed on his wife 
in the next room. The contribution of Mr. 
Leonard, in musical prose, dealing with the 
tragic conclusion of a marriage between an 
Indian and a Frenchman of high birth, bears 
out his reputation as a great poet.

THE HOME BOOK OF VERSE 

American and English (1580-1912) 

Compiled by Burton E. Stevenson. Collects the best short poetry of 
the English language not only the poetry everybody says is good, but 
also the verses that everybody reads. (3,842 pages; India paper, i vol., 
8vo, complete author, title and first line indices.) 

The most comprehensive and representative collection of American 
and English poetry ever published, including 3,120 unabridged poems 
from some 1,100 authors. 

It brings together in one volume the best short poetry of the English 
language from the time of Spenser, with especial attention to American 
verse. 

The copyright deadline has been passed, and some three hundred 
recent authors are included, very few of whom appear in any other general 
anthology, such as Lionel Johnson, Noyes, Housman, Mrs. Meynell, 
Yeats, Dobson, Lang, Watson, Wilde, Francis Thompson, Gilder, Le 
Gallienne, Van Dyke, Woodbury, Riley, etc., etc. 

The poems are arranged by subject, and the classification is unusually 
close and searching. Some of the most comprehensive sections are: 
Children's rhymes (300 pages); love poems (800 pages); nature poetry 
(400 pages); humorous verse (500 pages); patriotic and historical poems 
(600 pages); reflective and descriptive poetry (400 pages). No other col- 
lection contains so many popular favorites and fugitive verses.

E. L. Schuman in The Chicago Herald:- By Providence Journal:-" This stupendous collec- 

far the most comprehensive and satisfactory col- tion. As a piece of bookmaking it may fairly be

DR. HENRY VAN DYKE writes the Compiler: Your "Home Book of Verse" has come 
and I have looked through it with sincere and careful interest. I congratulate you on a 
great service to the reading of poetry. 

Of course, there are poems which are favorites of mine which are not in your book, and 
some which are in your book are not favorites of mine. That is natural and inevitable. 

But I know of no anthology of verse in a single volume which is as rich, as full, as 
generous, and therefore as likely to win new lovers for lyric poetry, as this book of yours. 
To adapt a phrase from Ruskin, it is a "king's treasury and a queen's garden. " I sincerely 
hope it will become a "Home Book." 

The words of this letter are weighed, and it is yours to use as you like if you will use it all.

THE NOVELS OF MRS. MARY S.WATTS 



"When Mrs. Watts' s fullness of style, her charmingly intimate regard for detail, 
and her wonderful ability for character portrayal are considered, . . . comparison 
with Thackeray and the Thackerayan quality of the great age of English fiction is 
striking and inevitable. . . . The scorn of meanness, the toleration of weakness, 
the pity for error, the detection of motive, the half-veiled satire, the reticence of 
feeling which suggests rather than displays emotion, result in passages of pathos or 
humor which might have come from the master's own pen." San Francisco Chronicle. 



NATHAN BURKE 



$1.50 



"There is a slowly increasing group of novels which seem likely to last much longer than the 
great mass of fiction which is talked about for a few months and then totally forgotten. This 
group is not large. Once in a decade an addition is made to the group. . . 'Nathan Burke' 
is a novel so sound, so filled with much that has inspired the great novels, that it is hard to 
maintain moderate standards of comparison." Boston Transcript. 



THE LEGACY 



$1.35 



"In 'Nathan Burke' and in 'The Legacy,' Mrs. Watts has reached a high- water mark in 
American fiction, has told two stories of genuine Americanism. Every page shows her truly 
remarkable gift of observation observation shrewd but not unkind and her power to probe 
the hearts of weak and erring mortals. Those who would keep in touch with the best product 
of story-telling in America must not miss 'The Legacy.' " New York Globe. 



VAN CLEVE

"Van Cleve's picture deserves to hang on the wall with the very best that American literature 
has painted of the American man. . . . Mrs. Watts brings back the Spanish War in a style 
Tolstoi himself could not have bettered." The Bellman. 

"Altogether the book is in ripeness and mellowness the best of the three excellent novels 
which Mrs. Watts has to her credit, and it may be added that all three are entitled to a place 
of honor in American pictures of this country." The Outlook. 



Mrs. Watts's New Novel. Just Published 

THE RISE OF JENNIE GUSHING 



$1.35 



" Mrs. Mary S. Watts's latest story . . . is as indubitably a masterpiece of characteriza- 
tion as were her 'Nathan Burke' and 'The Legacy.' It has, too, much of the warm humor of 
'Van Cleve.' . . . Jennie Gushing arouses your admiration, not merely for the self-control, 
balance, and judgment of the woman, but for her unselfishness and her almost glorious freedom 
from petty meanness and misjudgments, and the utter absence of self pity from her make-up. 
Indeed, it is a masterpiece of character drawing that, having all these fine qualities, Jennie never 
for an instant impresses you as a made-up character, created to work out a theory or to draw 
your sympathy." Brooklyn Daily Eagle. 

"Mrs. Watts has rapidly risen to a place of honor in the small group of our contemporary 
novelists who are seriously worth our while. Her books are native American to the core. This 
truly remarkable character study is remarkable in its unforced, altogether natural consistency 
and development. Loving service, the impulse to aid and comfort others, is the dominating 
trait of Jennie's character." New York Tribune. 

"Occasionally a book appears that is so human, so vital, that one rejoices and suffers with 
the people that inhabit it. This is such a book, and the growth and development of Jennie 
herself is the best work that Mrs. Watts has done. ... A character of the most profound 
and the most moving sweetness and wisdom, Jennie accepts the ugly facts and commonplaces of 
existence with serenity, but turns instinctively to beauty in whatever form it comes. ... It 
is a good sign when such books are written in America." Philadelphia Public Ledger.

OUR HOSTILITY TO ART. 

Every well-written novel seems immoral. 

Remy de Gourmont. 

Mr. Edward Garnett contributes " Some 
Remarks on American and English Fiction " 
to the current issue of " The Atlantic 
Monthly" with manifest doubts as to how his 
view will be received in this country. The 
editors, in a cautious foot-note, assure the 
reader that Mr. Garnett 's opinions are his 
own, and not for a moment to be confused with 
theirs. It is all very curious. For there is 
nothing iconoclastic, nothing daring, nothing 
unexpected in Mr. Garnett 's article. It is 
true that he "places" so many living writers, 
both English and American, that disagree- 
ment with him is bound to arise in this or that 
particular instance. But his main contention, 
which is not so much that English fiction is 
better than American fiction as that America 
is hostile to individuality, is eminently de- 
fensible. Mr. Garnett says : 

" The dogma put forward under innumerable 
guises persistently in America, that the thinker 
and the literary artist must cater to the tastes, 
ideas, and sentiments, moral and emotional, of the 
great majority under pain of being ignored or 
ostracized, was noted by De Tocqueville three gen- 
erations ago, but this dogma bred in the American 
bone seems to have been reinforced by the latter- 
day tyranny of the commercial ideal. The com- 
mercial man who says ' read this book because it is 
the best seller/ is seeking to hypnotize the indi- 
vidual's judgment and taste. If there be a notice- 
able dearth of originality of feeling and outlook in 
latter-day American fiction it must be because the 
individual is subjected from the start to the insis- 
tent pressure of social ideals of conformity which 
paralyze or crush out the finer, rarer, more sensi- 
tive individual talents. I do not say that English 
writers are not vexed in a minor degree by Mrs. 
Grundy's attempts to boycott or crush novels that 
offend the taste of ' the villa public,' but I believe 
that our social atmosphere favors the writer of true 
individuality." 

It may be possible to argue that the English 
advantage in this matter is a most uncertain 
quantity. It was an English journalist who 
reminded us the other day, apropos of the 
public dinner given to M. Anatole France in 
London, that his countrymen were pleased to 
honor a master who wrote in French when 
they would unquestionably have put him in 
jail for indecency if he had written in En-

glish. It was the English who convicted the 
translator of Zola's novels, was it not? But 
it is no great matter whether the English are 
as timid about recognizing the exceptional 
literary artist as we are, or only less timid. 
There can be no doubt that no civilized nation 
is any more timid than we of the United 
States. We approach all art with a chip on 
the shoulder, and we call the chip our moral- 
ity. Outside commercial circles our chiefest 
concern about a work of fiction is whether or 
not it is immoral. 

There might be something fine, something 
admirably courageous, in this attitude of ours 
if it were really morality that we are so 
strenuous to defend. To be anxious about 
morals is to be anxious about something that 
men have nobly died for. But our anxiety 
about art is no such high matter. It is obvious 
to the most casual observer that when we 
speak of morality in connection with art we 
mean that which is not exceptionable to the 
ordinary person's view of life and conduct, 
and that it is not immorality to which we ob- 
ject but the unusual, the exceptional. 

Miss Corinne Bacon, a librarian whose 
pamphlet on "What Makes a Novel Immoral" 
has enjoyed an unusual circulation, furnishes 
us with an illustration of this point. Miss 
Bacon thinks that those novels are immoral 
which "appeal to our lower nature," which 
confuse "right" and "wrong," and which are 
"untrue to life." As a prime example of the 
last class Miss Bacon cites Mrs. Olive Schrein- 
er's " The Story of an African Farm," which 
is, she says, characterized by "leaden pes- 
simism," and Mr. Hardy's "Jude the Ob- 
scure, ' ' which deals, Miss Bacon believes, with 
"abnormal eroticism." Such novels are un- 
true to "the normal life of men and women." 

Putting aside the irrelevant question (if 
there is any question) of the value of the two 
novels mentioned it ought to be obvious that 
fiction habitually deals with the abnormal and 
has seldom made so much as a pretense of 
doing anything else. Those novelists who 
have so passionately defended the ordinary 
individual as the desirable object of the novel- 
ist's art have succeeded in convincing us only 
where they were able to show us how extraor- 
dinarily ignorant of the ordinary we are. Is 
it necessary to say that so to deal with the 
ordinary is only another way of achieving the 
extraordinary, that is to say, the abnormal? 

What Miss Bacon doubtless means to say 



when she classifies Mrs. Schreiner's pessimism 
as "morbid" is that Mrs. Schreiner's pes- 
simism is so much deeper than, or different 
from, her own as to be unpleasant to her. So 
Miss Bacon, assuming that her own degree of 
pessimism is the only truly life-giving and 
moral degree, decides that Mrs. Schreiner's 
novel is immoral. And yet, if Miss Bacon is 
right in believing herself to be healthily bal- 
anced this side of extreme pessimism what 
advantage would Miss Bacon derive from 
reading any novelist who is equally fortunate ? 
It is plain that, so far as pessimism is con- 
cerned, only a writer possessed of considerably 
more than the ideal amount possessed by Miss 
Bacon could possibly furnish her with that 
spiritual adventure which it is the novelist's 
business to give. But Miss Bacon, discover- 
ing such a writer, rejects her novel as im- 
moral! 

The only answer to Miss Bacon's absurdi- 
ties, which should not occupy us for a moment 
if they were not so widely held as gospel, is 
to repeat that a work of art, and none more 
obviously than the novel, is a personal confes- 
sion. A novel is not an instrument by which 
we are to see the whole of life, or even a part 
of it, "as it really is." A novel is an invita- 
tion from a particular individual to look at 
life for a few hours through his eyes, to see 
in it what he sees, to feel about it what he 
feels. It is the very fact that his view, his 
confession, is his, and not ours, that makes it 
valuable to us. Indeed, a novel has value 
almost in proportion as the confessant's skill 
and power have enabled him to make his work 
the expression of his individuality. The nor- 
mal, or non-individual, person does not exist. 
But the artist is never so much as approxi- 
mately normal. Miss Bacon is perfectly right 
in believing that Mrs. Schreiner is an abnor- 
mal woman, though we should prefer to put 
it less scientifically and call her an altogether 
exceptional woman. 

Whether the hostility to the exceptional 
which Mr. Garnett remarks in us, a hostility 
almost as great in the case of the artist as in 
the case of the lunatic, is a permanent at- 
tribute of our particular democratic experi- 
ment remains to be seen. But we had sup- 
posed the fact of its existence was so gener- 
ally known that neither the editors of "The 
Atlantic Monthly" nor any other intelligent 
observers of the American scene would think 
of apologizing for publishing it.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



AMUSEMENT IN STATISTICS might be thought 
to be about as hard to find as, for instance, 
grapes on thornbushes, or figs on thistles, 
or, to change the simile, acute angles in a 
pentagon, or the square root of a minus quan- 
tity. Nevertheless some little recreation has 
been derived from a casual examination of 
library financial reports as presented in a 
number of current official publications from 
various free libraries of our country. The 
Detroit Public Library, for example, deplores 
in tearful accents its inability to keep its 
standard books well bound, and presents a 
moving picture (not a cinematograph) of its 
ragged regiment of classic authors as they 
"lean wearily against each other in their old 
garments, on the crowded shelves. ' ' But, ten 
pages later, this same annual report shows a 
"balance on hand" of $310,219.97, or not far 
from one-half the total receipts of the year, 
and almost three-fourths of the total expen- 
ditures. Why this enormous surplus? Or is 
it possible that we have misread the treas- 
urer's figures? A large unexpended balance 
is always a temptation to all sorts of foolish- 
ness and worse. Voters, too, might with some 
reason cut down their donation the next year 
if they find their liberality so little appre- 
ciated. In marked contrast to this unduly 
economical management of its funds on the 
part of the Detroit library, the report from 
the Lincoln (Nebraska) City Library shows 
total annual receipts of $11,740, and total dis- 
bursements of $12,429. Evidently the man- 
agement here believes that money is meant to 
spend, and that it is even wise to spend more 
than one has. A powerful lever on the lid 
of the city's strong box is a sturdy, fast- 
growing, and wholly unabashed annual defi- 
cit. Going a little further afield, we find the 
James V. Brown Library of Williamsport 
(Pennsylvania) sailing so close to the wind 
that out of receipts amounting to nearly ten 
thousand dollars it remains with a balance of 
less than one hundred and fifty dollars. That 
is not bad management. At Bristol (Con- 
necticut), on the other hand, the idle cash 
reported at the end of the year seems to be 
about a fifth part of the income not so good 
management. Lack of space forbids further 
expatiation on this fruitful theme. 


A THWARTED BUT UNDISMAYED LIBRARIAN 

sounds his note of invincible hopefulness and 
courage in what, for the present at least, and 
because of straitened means, must be regarded 
as the valedictory number of his excellent 
quarterly bulletin. The Providence Public 



Library, under Mr. William E. Foster's direc- 
tion, has attracted attention by reason of its 
intelligent and liberal ministration to the 
literary needs of its constituency. Notable, 
among other things, is its generous provision 
of books for its immigrant readers. Its 
current "Bulletin" prints in its list of late 
accessions many titles in languages so com- 
paratively unfamiliar as Armenian, Hebrew, 
Hungarian, Ruthenian, and Turkish, together 
with a far greater number in French, German, 
modern Greek, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, 
Russian, Spanish, Swedish, and Yiddish. And 
Providence is not exactly a cosmopolitan cen- 
tre or a very large city. But Mr. Foster 
regards the things done by himself and his 
co-workers as nothing to what might be done 
with larger resources. He likens this unful- 
filment of purpose to the one-time incomplete 
condition of the Washington Monument, but 
adds : "In one respect, it is true, this analogy 
does not hold. That is to say, if the residents 
of Washington had been compelled to look on 
the gradual taking down of some of the stones 
which had been so painfully raised into posi- 
tion, their regret would have been all the 
keener. But this is the situation of our read- 
ers, as they witness the withdrawal of some of 
the features of library work which it has 
taken years to attain." Nevertheless, a 
brighter dawn will succeed the present gloom, 
he confidently believes. "Few institutions 
have represented the hopes, aspirations, and 
endeavors of so many and so devoted work- 
ers; and it would be unthinkable to despair 
of its ultimate success; but for the present 
the outlook is undeniably dark. ' ' 


LITTLE LINGUISTIC PECULIARITIES betray the 
speaker's or writer's nationality or even, it 
may be, the county or the parish where he 
learned to talk. In a large way, Englishmen 
and Americans speak the same language, but 
in minor details they have their pet idioms 
and excite each other's derision. Mr. Maurice 
Baring, in his latest contribution to the 
gaiety of two nations he calls his book 
"Round the World in Any Number of Days" 
indulges in some remarks on " the American 
language," as for example: "Some day, 
when I have learned the American language 
properly, I mean to write a large book on the 
American language. In the meantime, the 
following condensed grammar for foreigners 
may prove useful for Americans going to 
England, as well as for Englishmen going to 
America: "Chapter 7. Rule I. (Very im- 
portant.) Whenever you say 'in' in English 
say either 'on 'or 'to 'in American. . . . There 
are one hundred and twenty-six exceptions to 



494 



THE DTAI, 



[Dec. 16 



this rule, the most important of which is 
this: "To be in trouble' is not translated 
'to be on trouble' in American. Rule II. The 
two most important words in American are 
'proposition' and 'stunt.' Everything is 
either a proposition or a stunt. There are no 
other rules." Prepositions will always cause 
more or less perplexity and disagreement. 
The Latin scholar will instinctively feel the 
propriety of saying "averse from," "in con- 
trast with/' "superiority over," and so on, 
where popular usage is less strict. That we 
do not make sufficient use of in, as is alleged 
above, is certainly not apparent to us, though 
we do speak of living on instead of in a street ; 
but even here we are not unalterably fixed, 
occasionally using the preposition preferred 
by our English cousins. On the other hand, 
we object to their being different to us in 
respect of certain idioms, and their colloquial 
and even literary use of off (see Mr. Arnold 
Bennett's writings) in place of from strikes 
us as a little unrefined. But who would have 
the whole world speak exactly the same lan- 
guage? . . . 

THE ARROGANCE OF INFERIORITY is a quality 
not unheard of in critics, and, not least of all, 
in literary critics. If we cannot surpass the 
performances of genius, we can at any rate 
cry down the genius, which we imagine 
amounts to the same thing, and is vastly 
easier. In a recent "Literary Letter" to 
the Springfield "Republican," Mr. Frank B. 
Sanborn takes occasion to comment on this 
defamatory habit. "This malicious way of 
estimating good men," he says, "is a poor 
trait in human nature, coming largely from 
vanity, to which many small vices may ba 
ascribed. It so pleases the petty human soul 
to feel itself superior to other human souls, 
that it almost instinctively misjudges them, 
especially by hearsay. Charles Lamb was 
humorously satirizing the race of men when 
he stammered out, 'No, I d-don't know h-him, 
but d mn him at a venture. ' ' After giving 
some illustrations of this proneness to depre- 
ciate in sundry book-criticisms, and, among 
them, a certain reviewer's malicious assault 
upon his (Mr. Sanborn 's) pen-portrait of his 
old friend, the poet Ellery Channing, he pro- 
ceeds: "It was an instance of that bitter 
intolerance which is the intellectual sin of 
New England; illustrated in times past by 
the federalist aspersions on Jefferson, by old 
J. Q. Adams's fling at Emerson, and the elder 1 
Professor Norton's sneer at Carlyle and 'the 
latest form of infidelity. ' Urbanity is forgot- 
ten in such exhibitions, or rather is shown 
to have been omitted from that particular 
critic's composition." It is the young far 



more than the old who are harshly intolerant 
in their censure: for, as Goethe long ago ob- 
served, we have only to grow old in order to 
become charitable, since we find in ourselves, 
if we live long enough, all the faults we have 

censured in others. 



A PROPOSED BOOK ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF 

WARFARE, by a Russian scientist, Dr. Alexis 
Maltseff, expert in psychiatry, member of the 
Munich Medical Society, and, until disabled 
by ague, a participant in the present Euro- 
pean conflict, is expected to set forth some 
noteworthy results of the writer's researches. 
The psychopathic condition of the belligerent 
and, to some extent, of the neutral nations is 
certainly a surprising and a painful phe- 
nomenon. Europe, Dr. Maltseff declares, is 
in a state of "bellicose psychosis verging on 
paranoia," and the "war is more like a 
mediaeval obsession of the masses than a ra- 
tional international struggle for power and 
glory. ' ' One form taken by the war madness 
is a persistent and absurd exaggeration of the 
enemy's numbers and losses, with correspond- 
ing magnifying of victories achieved on one's 
own side. Inability to give anything approach- 
ing a true account of battle experiences was 
proved by examination of wounded soldiers 
in Moscow hospitals. "Persistent, uncon- 
scious lying," says Dr. Maltseff, according to 
report, "is one of the first elements of war 
psychosis. It is the fruit of the terror and 
emotion which every man feels in battle. In 
prolonged actions the rank and file and the 
fighting officers do not know what they do." 
Fearful indeed is the prospect of what will 
follow after the war is over, if this authority 
is to be credited. So demoralizing is war, 
even to those who only read about it, in the 
newspapers, that a wave of crime will sweep 
over the world after the tempest now raging 
shall have subsided. "There will be a reac- 
tion against discipline and privation on the 
part of the disbanded reservists," and other 
things frightful to contemplate even as re- 
mote possibilities. But, with all due respect 
to Dr. Maltseff, specialists have been known 
to exaggerate, as well as soldiers that have, 
just left the battlefield. 



PEACE THROUGH SPELLING-REFORM is the 
theme of an earnest editorial in "The Pioneer 
of Simplified Speling. ' ' Not to weaken in the 
least degree the force of the appeal, we quote 
a few sentences in the writer's own "speling." 
He says of the reform: "We hav aulwaiz 
held that it woz a faktor which must be taiken

ganda. Brij over the speech barier, sielens

shonship ov the spoeken wurd, and yu hav 
gon mor than a step or tuu on the paath of 
yuniversal brutherhood. " But it is admit- 
ted that the present clash of arms can hardly 
be silenced by a mere revision of the diction- 
ary; the full effect of spelling-reform as a 
universal peace-maker cannot be felt until 
existing discords have been somewhat har- 
monized. "But when 'this wurld-madness 
haz been eksorsiezd'; when aul the haitful 
noizez ov worfair ar murjd in that luvli 
karesing wurd 'pees,' then wil kum the dai

months and a half of nightmare, even those 
who are strongly anti-reform in their orthog- 
raphy would doubtless be willing, in order to 
secure a lasting peace, to spell the word 
"pees," or "peas," or even "pease," hence- 
forth and for ever. 



BOOKS WITH WHICH TO BECOME SATURATED, 

in order to acquire a good English style in 
writing, need not be many in number; in 
fact they may be surprisingly few, and prob- 
ably, if a style at once simple and clear and 
vigorous is desired, the fewer the better. One 
single book, the English Bible, as has often 
been remarked, will supply all that is neces- 
sary in the above-named qualities, and many 
rhetorical graces besides. Lincoln knew his 
Bible from cover to cover, and next to that 
he had an enviable acquaintance with Shake- 
speare; and what a master he was with the 
pen and in spoken utterance! Dr. Talcott 
Williams, addressing the Smith College stu- 
dents recently, urged those who contemplated 
entering his profession (journalism) to study 
diligently and incessantly both the Bible and 
Shakespeare, until "saturated with their 
thought and expression." A good writer, he 
further pointed out, "must possess facility, 
confidence, and a sense of style. He should 
realize that there is a best way to say every- 
thing, and should not stop till he has found 
that way." To his excellent advice always to 
begin an article with the not least important 
part of what one has to say, he might have 
added the counsel to end it with something 
equally attention-compelling to avoid the 
too-common practice of ' ' tapering off. ' ' 



COMMUNICATION. 



THE " CONSPIRACY OF SILENCE." 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
Another irritating instance of the "conspiracy 
of silence," similar to the one described in THE DIAL 
of November 16, is. the case of Graf von Loeben 



(1786-1825). He wrote and published about as 
many works as did, say, Heine, distributed as fol- 
lows: one conventional drama; one musical-roman- 
tic drama ; " Guido," a novel of 360 pages ; about 
thirty-seven novelettes; four volumes of poems, 
some of which are excellent as to content, the 
great majority of which are superb as to form; 
several thousand aphorisms; a good commentary 
to Madame de Stael's " De 1'Allemagne " ; about 
sixty reviews; and a long list of letters, many of 
which are direct contributions to literary criticism. 
In addition, he left a number of unpublished frag- 
ments, including the outline of a pretentious novel 
of which Heinrich von Veldeke was to be the hero. 
He translated from Ariosto, Dante, Guarini, Hor- 
ace, Ovid, Petrarch, and Virgil. Finally, he was 
an editor of repute. As a man he seems to have 
left nothing to be desired. Professor Muncker 
says " er war eine scheme Seele in des Wortes 
schonster Bedeutung." He influenced Eichendorff 
and Platen, and many contend that his ballad on 
the Lorelei was the immediate inspiration of Heine 
in his composition on the same subject. Fouque 
called him " a poet by the Grace of God," while 
Goethe is credited with the remark that " er war 
der vorziiglichste Dichter jener Zeit." Many of 
the operas on the Lorelei are said to have owed 
their origin to his saga in prose on the same 
subject. 

And yet, the compendious " Konversations- 
Lexikon " of Meyer and Brockhaus is silent on 
him, unless it be in the discussion of some of the 
numerous poets with whom he associated. Of the 
twenty best known histories of German literature, 
some of which treat the nineteenth century exclu- 
sively, only six contain his name, and these simply 
mention him as the friend of some one else. 

We do not wish to have Graf von Loeben 
revived: there are too many unread poets now. 
His poems are, for example, good, but not so 
good as those of Riickert, and no one has read all 
of Riickert. To study Loeben for his own sake 
would be to set up false values. But since these 
wordy manuals list so many little, petty writers 
and poets, they might also include Graf von 
Loeben. It is perhaps a case of group psychology 
in letters, rather than a conspiracy of silence. 
Loeben was not quite good enough to last after he 
died. He has not been studied. It would be diffi- 
cult to write on him in an encyclopaedia; it hasn't 
been done. But let some one do it once, and then 
every succeeding encyclopaedia will have an article 
on this obscure but prolific poet, this influential 
man. 

It is not easy to make a poorer investment than 
is made in the buying of the average encyclopaedia. 
It contains, despite the oratory of the agent, huge 
stores of information that never concern us, so 
that these volumes simply clutter up our desks, 
and as to the few subjects in which we are espe- 
cially interested, the information is always and 
without exception deficient in quantity, and many 
times warped and unreasoned, handed-down and 
saved-over as to quality.

CALJFORXIA.* 



The near approach of the completion of the 
Panama Canal, of the unique California- 
Panama Exposition at San Diego, and of the 
Panama-Pacific Exposition (embodied accord- 
ing to a most glorious color-scheme by M. 
Guerin on the shore of the Golden Gate in 
San Francisco) turns the attention of our 
travelling public from war-ridden Europe to 
our own Riviera. American publishers, au- 
thors, and artists have anticipated the de- 
mand for informing and helpful books on 
California, and have produced a notable array 
of interesting and instructive works which set 
forth the Golden State in various aspects 
scenic, historical, political, and naturalistic. 
It is noteworthy that two of California 's fore- 
most novelists, Mrs. Austin and Mrs. Ather- 
ton, have turned their pens to this field of 
descriptive exploration to meet the demands 
of the exposition year. And well they might, 
for the theme in any aspect is rich in interest 
and dramatic in setting. 

Foremost among these books in beauty of 
conception and execution is Mr. Sutton 
Palmer's and Mrs. Mary Austin's "Califor- 
nia, the Land of the Sun." It is a sincere 
and studied effort to convey to the uninitiated 
reader something of the charm of the land- 
scape, the brilliant atmosphere, the smil- 
ing valleys, blooming mesas, waving fields, 
fruitful orchards, stately forests, and tower- 
ing snow-clad mountain peaks of Califor- 
nia. The two collaborators use different 
mediums to convey their ideas but they speak 
one language. Mrs. Austin's text carries the 
reader northward from San Diego, through 
Los Angeles (with its "mothering moun- 
tains ") up the coast through Santa Barbara 
and its mission to Carmel and Monterey, with 
its beautiful cypresses, to the Bay Region, 
and thence to the great twin interior valleys 
and to the High Sierras and sage brush coun- 
try beyond. It is a book of the country rather 
than of the city, for it is redolent of wayside

flowers, appreciative of distant vistas, and 
fondly reminiscent of the pastoral and oft- 
times tragic early days. Witness the charm- 
ing chapter on "Old Spanish Gardens": 

"A Spanish garden is a very intimate affair. It 
is the innermost undergarment of the family life. 
Dona Ina's was walled away from the world by 
six feet of adobe, around the top of which still 
lingered the red tiles of Mission manufacture. It 
was not spoken of as the garden at all, it was the 
patio, an integral part of the dwelling. There 
was, in fact, a raw-hide cot on the long gallery 
which gave access to it, and Dona Ina's drawn- 
work chemises bleaching in the sun. The patio is 
a gift to us from Andalusia." 
One would hardly expect the exactness of a 
geographical work or the completeness of Bae- 
deker in this poetical tribute to the land of 
sunshine, but one can hardly forgive the omis- 
sion of Oakland, the third city of the state, 
from the map and of Palo Alto and Berkeley, 
the intellectual capitals of the commonwealth, 
from all reference in the text. And it is a 
curiously critical and partial interpretation 
of the bracing and invigorating climate of 
San Francisco which the author ventures: 
" The very worst location in the world, this 
windy promontory past which the grey tides 
race, but so long as a city can dramatise itself, 
one situation will do as well as another in 
which to render itself immortal." The "larg- 
est of the true pines" (p. 152) is not Pinus 
monticola but rather the giant sugar pine 
Lamb$rtiana, and the island of Santa Rosa 
(p. 12) faces Santa Barbara, not San Diego. 
Mr. Sutton Palmer's part in the work consists 
of thirty-two beautiful colored plates repro- 
duced from paintings representative of the 
choicest bits of California's landscape. In 
selection of themes and in composition they 
leave little to be desired, and as a whole they 
give an excellent impression of the wonderful 
variety and the striking contrasts of the scen- 
ery of California. But they are disappoint- 
ing in some particulars, possibly as a result 
of losses in execution by the three-color proc- 
ess. Mount Tamalpais, for example, lacks any 
suggestion of the brilliancy it shows at its 
best, and the Mill Valley plate quite fails to 
reveal the Marin Hills. The printer has evi- 
dently overworked the red tones in most of 
the plates and reduced too much the colors of 
the other end of the spectrum. 

A series of charming essays on the trees, 
flowers, and fruits of California from the 
facile pen of an enthusiastic lover of the out- 
of-doors is to be found in Mr. Charles Francis 
Saunders 's "With the Flowers and Trees in 
California." The "Land of Sunshine" is so 
full of novelties of the plant world, both of 
its own and of those adopted from even the

remotest corners of the earth, which find a 
congenial home in its equable climate ren- 
dered even more acceptable by irrigation, 
that the inquisitive lover of floAvers from the 
East has many queries to make as soon as the 
gates of the mountains are passed. Spain, 
Japan, Australia, South Africa, and the isles 
of the sea have all contributed to the brilliant 
array of bloom and foliage which adorns the 
parks and roadways and buries the bungalows 
in billows of bloom. In this book one may 
find first-hand knowledge of the flowers, trees, 
and shrubbery of the deserts, the mesas, the 
forests, the gardens, and the varied orchards 
of this land where nature is lavish and the 
hand of man ingenious to provoke her to 
burst into bloom. The book is far from being 
a dry scientific catalogue, as Mr. Saunders has 
managed to weave into its pages a great deal 
of descriptive matter about native and intro- 
duced plants and historical lore concerning 
the early botanical explorers, Douglas, Cham- 
isso, Menzies, Eschscholtz, and Nuttall. The 
human interest of plants plays a large part in 
his treatment. He is interested to know what 
plants came overland in the immigrant cara- 
vans, what herbs were used by the Indian, the 
sources of the fibres chosen by the basket- 
weaver, the fruits, flowers, and vegetables of 
the old Mission gardens and ranch patios, and 
the characteristic flowers of the gardens of to- 
day. The 'accounts; of the blooming of the 5 mesa 
and of the botanical riches of the desert are 
charming bits of descriptive natural history. 
It is to be regretted that so little of the for- 
ests and of the mountain flora of the north- 
ern part of the state receives the notice it so 
well deserves in these pages. We note that 
the Washington palm is called, by oversight, 
"pine" (plate facing p. 10), and that the 
consonant-rich name of Eschscholtz, god- 
father of the California poppy, is (p. 105) 
robbed of one of its consonants. All lovers 
of nature who seek refreshment out-of-doors 
in California will find Mr. Saunders 's book a 
delightful companion and a never failing re- 
minder of California's greatest charms. 

A plea for the immediate conservation of 
the sources of Pacific coast history in the form 
of original materials not yet in the safe keep- 
ing of historical archives is the occasion of 
Mr. John F. Davis 's "California Romantic 
and Resourceful." This brochure contains in 
revised and expanded form his Admission 
Day address descriptive of the past of Cali- 
fornia, ' ' which possesses a wealth of romantic 
interest, a variety of contrast, a novelty of 
resourcefulness and an intrinsic importance 
which enthralls the imagination." There is 
added the address on the occasion of placing 



of the bronze tablet upon the oldest adobe 
building in San Francisco to mark the birth- 
place of Concha Arguello, the heroine of one 
of the most tragic love stories of the world. 
For it was here that the radiant and bewitch- 
ing Conchita was wooed and won by the ad- 
venturous and resolute Nicolai Petrovich 
Resanoff, Russian chamberlain, explorer, and 
advance agent of the Slavic civilization that 
reached in 1806 southward from Alaska even 
to the Golden Gate. Bret Harte's poetic 
"Conception de Arguello" is reproduced 
with extended critical and historical annota- 
tions to complete the setting of this incident. 
Had the fates vouchsafed a happy conclusion 
instead of the tragic death of the lover in the 
heart of Siberia, on his way to secure at 
Madrid royal sanction for this international 
alliance, history might even now be writing a 
different story of Slav expansion. 

Robert Louis Stevenson characterized the 
United States as a " songful, tuneful land and 
if the new Homer shall arise from the western 
Continent, his verse will be enriched, his 
pages sing spontaneously, with the names of 
states and cities that would strike the fancy 
in a business circular." California has her 
full share and more of tuneful names, thanks 
to the period of Spanish settlement and to the 
Indian nomenclature that still lingers in her 
valleys and mountains to add a touch of ro- 
mance not wholly free from sadness. These 
names have survived in considerable number 
in spite of the misdirected efforts at abbre- 
viation and foreshortening on the part of 
economically inclined postal officials. They 
tend to increase with the growth of settle- 
ments, due to the zeal of real-estate boom- 
ers who seek to capitalize the romantic past. 
Not all of the word-coinage of the "Spaniards 
from Kansas" would pass the critical inspec- 
tion of one familiar with the mellifluent 
tongue of the padres: witness such crudities: 
as Rio Vista for the longer but infinitely more 
pleasing Vista del Rio. Madame Nellie Van 
de Grift Sanchez has rendered a real service 
to all those, and they are many, to whom the 
Spanish tongue is a closed book, by compiling 
a list of " Spanish and Indian Place Names 
of California" and annotating the citations 
with a running comment of gossipy informa- 
tion as to their meaning and origin. Much of 
local Spanish and Indian history and tradi- 
tion is woven into these seemingly disjointed 
notes. The arrangement is geographical, thus 
facilitating use by the tourist en route, gen- 
erally, from San Diego northward, more or 
less along the line of the old Mission Camino 
Real. An alphabetical list in which are gath- 
ered all scattered place names of interest

completes the work, which will be of perma- 
nent value to travellers as well as a reference 
work in libraries and schools. A series of cuts 
from some early source, unfortunately not 
named, portrays the Spanish Missions; other 
illustrations are from recent photographs. The 
"Univ. of Cal. Publ. of Arch, and Tec." (34) 
is a lapsus pennce for Univ. Calif. Publ. Am. 
Arch, and Ethn. That the Indians ever did 
much "fishing in teeming streams" (p. 26) 
in Southern California where the rivers run 
"upside down" is very doubtful. The chem- 
ical metaphor in the phrase (p. 6) "when put 
to the acid test of such investigation, melt 
into thin air" is somewhat mixed. But these 
are minor defects in a very useful, attractive, 
and well-written book. 

Mrs. Gertrude AthertonV California: An 
Intimate History" reveals an historian gifted 
with a keen sense of the dramatic, a pene- 
trating power of analyzing the springs of 
human action, and a virile forcefulness and 
freedom of expression. These are qualities 
which make history at least attractive, how- 
ever much they may bias the historian 's selec- 
tion and treatment of material. California's 
past abounds in dramatic incidents from the 
days of the zealous padres of the Spanish 
Missions to the now projected graft trials. It 
scintillates with picturesque characters from 
the zealous Father Junipero Serra, the dash- 
ing Rezanoff, the indomitable Coleman, the 
ill-fated Broderick, the rampant Kearny, to 
the forceful Heney. The author has utilized 
these abundant materials, so full of human 
interest, to weave a dramatic story of striking 
incidents which portray the fitful and chang- 
ing life of a great state, which more than any 
other in the Union embodies in its history the 
fateful tragedies of the frontier. Her history 
is a personal and political one, cast in dra- 
matic mould and illumined by word pictures 
from the trained hand of the novelist: 

" That long chain of snow-white red-tiled mis- 
sions, hedged with Castilian roses, surrounded 
with olive-orchards, whose leaves were silver in the 
sun, orange groves heavy with golden fruit, the 
vast sweep of shimmering grain-fields broken by 
stately oaks, winding rivers set close with the tall 
pale cottonwoods, lakes with the long branches of 
willows trailing over the surface, bounded by for- 
est and mountain and sea, and not a city to break 
the harmony, must have been the fairest sight in 
the modern world." 

" Father Fr. Junipero Serra may have failed to 
reap the great harvest of Indian souls he had bap- 
tized with such gratitude and exultation, and that 
consoled him for all his afflictions, but he lifted 
California from the unread pages of geological 
history and placed it on the modern map. I won- 
der what he thinks of it." 



It is a story of men and an analysis of their 
motives rather than an account of the great 
movements in national and international 
affairs which have found expression in the 
life of the state. It is perhaps for this rea- 
son and because of her preference for the dra- 
matic that her only attempt to portray the 
intellectual, educational, literary, and artistic 
life of the state is to be found in an all too

California in a fine print appendix. In like

1STEW MEMOIRS OF CHARLES STEWART 
PARXELL,.* 



In the memorable month of July, 1914, the 
movement for the repeal of the Act of Union 
between England and Ireland, which O'Con- 
nell organized more than seventy years ago, 
saw at least a partial triumph. The new 
machinery of government provided by the 
Home Rule Act has not yet been set in motion ; 
but the law is on the statute books and the 
enemies of home rule will probably not be able 
to repeal the act or modify it in any important 
respect. The Asquith measure is not, per- 
haps, what O'Connell and his followers had 
hoped for: it does not give independence to 
the Irish people; but while Ireland continues 
to be a part of the Empire and the Kingdom, 
the new law gives the island its own legislature 
with a large measure of authority over Irish 
affairs. The ideas that were enacted into law 
in the third home rule bill were not those of 
O'Connell; they were developed by one who 
in leadership and statesmanship was far 
greater than the "Liberator" from Kerry, 
Charles Stewart Parnell. 

The long debates on this proposition both 
within and without parliament naturally 
turned popular attention to the history of the 
man who first made the Irish question a 
serious issue in British politics. Two memoirs 
of this remarkable man have recently come 
from the press : one by his brother, Mr. John 
Howard Parnell, and another by Mrs. Katha- 
rine 'Shea, whom Parnell married in the last 
year of his life, but with whom he had stood 
on a footing of close intimacy for ten years

before. These works are in no sense of the 
word biographies ; Mr. John Howard Parnell 
appears to have made no researches except in 
his own memory; and Katharine O'Shea 
(such is the name given on the title page), 
though she publishes a large number of let- 
ters, has apparently used no documents except 
such as she has found in her own possession. 
The student who turns to these letters in the 
hope of getting new light on Parn ell's politi- 
cal life will be disappointed: the letters are 
interesting but not very informing; they are 
brief, often very brief, and fervid notes from 
a man to a woman who ruled his affections, 
and as a rule do not deal with public affairs 
except in a very vague manner. The follow- 
ing, dated at Dublin, September 25, 1881, is 
almost typical of the collection : 
" My own Loveliest, I send you these few words 
to assure Wine that her husband always thinks of 
her and hopes that she is well and happy. 

Your Own King." 

It is difficult to understand in what way the 
publication of such letters will serve the cause 
of English or Irish history. 

It is true, however, that the letters written 
during certain important periods of Parnell 's 
career have a somewhat greater interest for 
the student of history. Such are the letters 
written from Kilmainham jail in 1881 and 
1882, of which the first one contains this sig- 
nificant statement : 

" Politically it is a fortunate thing for me that I 
have been arrested, as the movement is breaking 
fast, and all will be quiet in a few months, when I 
shall be released." 

The letters included in the chapter on the 
"Kilmainham treaty" between the Irish lead- 
ers and the Gladstone government are also of 
considerable importance. It is in connection 
with this treaty that Mrs. O'Shea first ap- 
pears as a factor in Irish politics. 

As memoirs written by persons who knew 
the "inscrutable" Parnell as he was in pri- 
vate life, these volumes will have some value 
for future biographers. The importance of 
Mr. John Howard Parnell's "Memoir" lies 
chiefly in the earlier chapters which deal with 
the life of his eminent brother before he en- 
tered a public career; to our knowledge of 
Parnell's political character the author adds 
almost nothing. Mrs. O'Shea professes to tell 
Parnell's "love story and political life"; but 
her book is for the most part a biography of 
herself. Mrs. 'Shea was the daughter of an 
English clergyman, and we gather from her 
narrative that she was a capable, clever, and 
attractive woman. In 1867 she married Cap- 
tain William 'Shea, a young Irish aristocrat. 
The 'Sheas do not seem to have been very 



congenial: the wife was unconventional in 
her attitude toward the world and the hus- 
band was a failure in almost everything that 
he undertook. After an experience as a 
breeder of fast horses which brought him far 
on the road toward bankruptcy, the young 
captain found himself with nothing to do and 
with no adequate source of income : 
" Willie was now longing for some definite occupa- 
tion, and he knew many political people. While 
he was on a visit to Ireland early in 1880 he was 
constantly urged by his friends, the O'Donnells and 
others, to try for a seat in the next parliament. . . ." 
Mr. O'Shea feared that his want of money 
would make it impossible for him to be a can- 
didate, but his wife urged "him to stand, for 
I knew it would give him occupation he liked 
and keep us apart and therefore good 
friends." Captain O'Shea was elected, t and 
to promote his political fortunes his wife be- 
gan to cultivate the friendship of Charles 
Stewart Parnell, the unquestioned leader of 
the Irish forces. This was in 1880, and from 
that time Parnell was a frequent visitor at the 
home of the O 'Sheas. 

Mrs. O'Shea seems to have been more than 
a friend or a mere mistress: she claims to 
have become Parnell's political secretary and 
an accepted intermediary between him and 
the government. This may have been of some 
advantage to her ' ' king, ' ' but the relationship 
also had its embarrassments ; at one time when 
Captain O'Shea was in danger of failing to 
secure a seat in parliament, Parnell found it 
necessary almost to compel a reluctant con- 
stituency to give him a seat. 

Though the student of history will find but 
little in these volumes that he cannot obtain 
elsewhere, he will, if he is interested in prob- 
lems of personal and political ethics, find 
much of interest in them. There is first of all 
the author's relationship to Parnell: 

"And because Parnell contravened certain social 
laws, not regarding them as binding him in any 
way, and because I joined him in this contraven- 
tion since his love made all else of no account to 
me, we did not shrink at the clamour of the up- 
holders of those outraged laws, nor resent the 
pressing of the consequences that were inevitable 
and always foreseen." 

SJie wishes us to believe that the relationship 
was an honorable one; and yet the narrative 
shows clearly that for a decade she was com- 
pelled to lead a life of constant deception. 
And when Parnell's child was born, in 1882, 
Captain O'Shea believed that the child was 
his and hoped that its birth might bring about 
a complete reconciliation. The narrative leads 
one to feel that neither Katharine 'Shea's 
relationship to her husband nor her relation-

ship to her lover was particularly sacred. It 
would seem that her version of Parnell's "love 
story" adds, if possible, to the guilt that the 
world has imputed to him since it was made 
public in 1890. 

Mr. John Howard Parnell barely mentions 
Mrs. O'Shea and has very little to say about 
this part of his brother's life. Without at- 
tempting to defend his brother, he states the 
belief of the family that Captain O'Shea was 
" a false friend of Charley's, and simply waiting 
his time to strike a fatal blow. ... As far as our 
family was concerned, we were unanimous in re- 
garding the institution of proceedings at this time 
as being due to a political plot, having for its 
object the ruin of Charley." 

If it was a plot, the plot succeeded, for the 
ruin was complete, as Mrs. O'Shea found to 
her great chagrin a few weeks later. 

The most startling part of Mrs. 'Shea's 
book is the charge that the Liberal* chiefs and 
especially Gladstone, who threw Parnell over- 
board after the court had acted in the divorce 
suit, had known about Parnell's love for Mrs. 
O'Shea and had even accepted his mistress as 
a sort of confidential agent in dealing with the 
Irish party : 

" For ten- years Gladstone had known of the rela- 
tions between Parnell and myself, and had taken 
full advantage of the facility this intimacy offered 
him in keeping in touch with the Irish leader. For 
ten years. But that was a private knowledge. 
Now it was a public knowledge, and an English 
statesman must always appear on the side of the 
angels. So Mr. Gladstone found his religion could 
at last be useful to his country." 

Whether Gladstone erred in ignoring the 
facts of Parnell's immorality in private life, 
and whether his actions after the facts were 
revealed will justify Mrs. 'Shea's charges of 
inconsistency and hypocrisy, are problems that 
the reviewer does not feel called upon to solve 
or even to discuss. If Gladstone were living 
he would no doubt be able to explain and de- 
fend his conduct ; but he is no longer able to 
reply. It is the reviewer's opinion, however, 
that Gladstone's place in English history is 
fairly secure, and that Mrs. 'Shea's charges 
will not lead to any appreciable change in the 
world's estimate of his private and public 
character. LAURENCE M . LAESON.

MR. G. LOWES DICKIXSOX ox 
EAST AND WEST.* 



The most serious danger in a trip around 
the world is neither shipwreck, nor disease, 
but the temptation to write a book. Even 
fasting and prayer seem of little avail against 
this particular onslaught of the Enemy of 
Man. During the months of travel any un- 
spoiled wayfarer, with ordinary intelligence 
and reasonable mental equipment, finds him- 
self so delightfully refreshed, so intensely 
interested, so stimulated to fertile reflection, 
that it seems almost a sin not to write a book 
and thus share with the world the benefit of 
his impressions and experiences. But sober 
thought should recall that the seaways of 
literature are dotted with boresome unread 
volumes, which ought to warn us of this peril 
of the deep. Naturally, our experienced 
essayist has not escaped such thoughts, nor 
does he present his little book without mis- 
givings: "In reprinting them [articles from 
the "Manchester Guardian" and the "En- 
glish Review"] I have chosen a title which 
may serve also as an apology. What I offer 
is not Reality, but appearances to me. ' ' How- 
ever, the solicitations of friends and editors, 
with the seductive opportunity of contrasting 
East and West, proved too strong for our 
literary wayfarer, who had been enjoying a 
Kahn fellowship, and he succumbed. On the 
whole, we must be glad he did, although we 
do not feel that his present offering is quite 
as valuable as some of its predecessors so 
warmly reviewed in these columns. 

Of course Mr. Dickinson could not perpe- 
trate a book of the ordinary ' ' travel and place 
type," and does not fill his pages with hack- 
neyed descriptions of familiar scenes. Udai- 
pur and Agra, for instance, are not even men- 
tioned, while Niagara serves merely as an 
occasion for recording a delightful, if imagi- 
nary, conversation. But even our veteran 
litterateur does not quite escape the curse of 
the globe-trotter, for he wastes one chapter 
on the mongrel Malay theatre at Penang and 
another on a commonplace treatment of 
Peking. We could almost wish that the writer 
of "Letters of a Chinese Official" had never 
seen China, although there is good reading in 
"A Sacred Mountain" and "In the Yangtse 
Gorges. ' ' 

When he reaches Japan, he is captivated 
at once, as all of us are captivated ; but Nippon 
has been described and anatomized and eulo- 
gized and berated so often during the last 
two decades that it is almost impossible to

attain a new point of view or offer your read- 
ers any fresh pabulum. However, the papers 
on "First Impressions of Japan "and "Fuji" 
are genuinely enjoyable. When he turns to 
write of "Japan and America" he finds most 
of us prepared to share his feeling that 
"patience and sympathy" are sadly lacking 
among the Californians, and to concede, even 
to enlarge upon, the many good qualities of 
the Japanese. But why should he insist that 
the "morals" of that attractive people are 
probably higher than those of Europe and 
America? Surely he must give "morals" a 
new and elaborate definition, if he is to carry 
his point. 

But obviously we may not wander in this 
spirit of enjoyment or criticism through the 
whole volume, so we hasten to say that its 
real value for us must be sought in the chap- 
ters on America and in the author's reflec- 
tions on the differences between East and 
West. 

Now his general attitude toward our land 
is kindly. In a spirit of unnecessary but gen- 
tlemanly apology he expresses regret for a 
tone of exasperation in his comments on us; 
but his irritation and his expression thereof 
are mild and ladylike and courtly compared 
with the violent wrath and indignant stric- 
tures of many of our homeborn critics. Mr. 
Dickinson believes that the vision of America 
is the vision of the lighting up of the millions, 
and that herein lies America's great contribu- 
tion to civilization ; but it is not what he 
comes across in his experience. And there is 
the point. It is so easy for a visitor to see 
our perfectly obvious failures ; it is so impos- 
sible to perceive what we are really doing. 
We do make a hopeless muddle of many 
things, to our own constant and bitter grief; 
but we do dream and we do try. We are too 
keen about money; but money is no more 
powerful in America than in England, or 
Germany, assert it who will ; and it is absurd 
to say that "no American youth of ambition 
leaves college with any less or greater purpose 
in his heart than that of emulating Mr. Car- 
negie or Mr. Rockefeller." Our poor col- 
leges and universities are open to no end of 
perfectly just criticism ; but they are the best 
antidotes the country has to the Carnegie- 
Rockefeller ideal of success. Again, we agree 
with our author that comment on most of our 
Sunday newspapers is quite superfluous ; but 
it would have been only fair to add that, 
despite all its palpable faults, the American 
press has often been the agent of tremendous 
good. However, it is well to have the tonic 
truth told us as often as possible, and there 



is no need to smear the rim of the bitter 
medicinal cup with the honey of compliment. 
And yet, Mr. Dickinson has missed America. 
His graceful and forceful comments are wel- 
come and helpful ; but he himself has not yet 
discovered us. We are seen at our truest in 
our educational striving, for all its un- 
bounded failure; and if our Cambridge 
economist had spent a large part of his time 
in studying our schools and colleges, he would 
still have had countless strictures to pass, but 
he would have come much nearer understand- 
ing our dream and our efforts than by wan- 
dering about like a thousand other intelligent 
visitors among the things that any eyes can 
see. 

And whatever else anybody may discover 
in our variegated United States we should 
like to know where Mr. Dickinson made sure 
that the predominant physical type is "the 
great jaw and chin, the huge teeth and preda- 
tory mouth." We may sacrifice beauty and 
distinction to force in our speech as in our 
politics; we may be capable of living and 
acting only in masses; we may have abso- 
lutely no culture, although we honestly be- 
lieve we have seen gleams thereof; it may be 
fair to accuse us of everything from super- 
ficiality to money-grubbing ; but we must pro- 
test against that great jaw and chin, those 
huge teeth, and that predatory mouth, as a 
basis of our national physiognomy. Surely 
the misfortune of individuals must not be 
translated into a racial calamity. Moreover, 
it is to be hoped that this sentence of con- 
demnation he passes will not come into the 
hands of any well-trained anthropologists, for 
they would justly flay him alive on purely 
scientific grounds. 

Of the general contrast he draws between 
East and West, we may give only this inade- 
quate summary. There is a West, in a real 
sense, with a unity of its own ; but it must be 
limited in time to the last two centuries and 
in space to the countries of Western Europe 
and the continent of America. He is not 
quite so sure that there is an East ; for Japan 
and China are distinctly different from India. 
And in fact he ultimately takes only the last 
named country as the opposite of his West. 
In his East, thus circumscribed, the great 
feature is the "religion of Eternity," which 
proposes as its end, not the living of temporal 
life in a particular spirit, but the transcend- 
ing of it by a special experience and the com- 
ing into union with the Infinite. "Life is an 
evil ; and the escape is either, for the masses, 
by death, or, for the men of spiritual genius, 
by a flight to the Eternal. ' ' 



502 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16 



And now we may quote the confession of 
faith he has put on the lips of the West : 

" I believe in the ultimate distinction between 
Good and Evil, and in a real process in a real 
Time. I believe it to be my duty to increase Good 
and diminish Evil; I believe that in doing this I 
am serving the purpose of the world. I know this ; 
I do not know anything else; and I am reluctant 
to put questions to which I have no answer, and 
to which I do not believe that anyone has an 
answer. Action, as defined above, is my creed. 
Speculation weakens action. I do not wish to 
speculate, I wish to live. And I believe the true 
life to be the life I have described." 

Naturally, however, he realizes that many 
Western men have a place for the Eternal and 
the Infinite, and he is willing to modify his 
antithesis slightly by wording it: In India, 
the emphasis is on the Eternal ; in the West, 
on Time. 

For himself he is quite clearly and definitely 
on the side of the latter : 

" I have said in the preceding pages hard things 
about Western civilization. I hate many of its 
manifestations, I am out of sympathy with many 
of its purposes. I can see no point, for instance, 
in the discovery of the north or the south pole, 
and very little in the invention of aeroplanes; 
while gramophones, machine guns, advertisements, 
cinematographs, submarines, dreadnoughts, cos- 
mopolitan hotels, seem to me merely fatuous or 
sheerly disastrous. But what lies behind all this, 
the tenacity, the courage, the spirit of adventure, 
this it is that is the great contribution of the West. 
It is not the aeroplane that is valuable; probably 
it will never be anything but pernicious, for its 
main use is likely to be for war. But the fact that 
men so lightly risk their lives to perfect it, that 
is valuable. The West is adventurous; and, what 
is more, it is adventurous on a quest. For behind 
and beyond all its fatuities, confusions, crimes, 
lies, as the justification of it all, that deep deter- 
mination to secure a society more just and more 
humane, which inspires all men and all movements 
that are worth considering at all, and to those who 
can understand, gives greatness and significance 
even to some of our most reckless enterprises. We 
are living very ' dangerously ' ; all the forces are 
loose, those of destruction as well as those of crea- 
tion; but we are living towards something; we 
are living with the religion of Time." 

After the criticisms we have been bold 
enough to pass on this delightful little vol- 
ume, it is a pleasure to close with such a char- 
acteristically thoughtful passage. Occasion- 
ally the book must move a serious reader to 
almost impatient repudiation; much more 
often it will evoke his sympathy and ap- 
proval; and always it will command his 
respect for its sanity and seriousness of atti- 
tude, his admiration for its lucidity and 
gracefulness of style.

BALZAC AXD FLAUBERT.* 



M. Emile Faguet is no less vigorous, direct, 
and unsparing as a critic of the French novel 
than as a critic of the French democracy, 
though readers of "The Cult of Incompe- 
tence" and "The Dread of Responsibility" 
will not find it hard to believe that he is 
somewhat more patient with the former; for, 
while he writes in both fields as the believer 
in aristocracy and the enemy of demagoguery, 
the temptation to laughter and scorn is less 
likely to interfere with judicial sobriety when 
he is dealing with literary art than when he 
is contemplating the crowd. 

"An admirable literary workman, upright, 
conscientious, scrupulous, and arduous," he 
says of Balzac, in the critical study now trans- 
lated for the English and American public. 
"He is of those who have deserved, even on 
moral grounds, both worldly success and last- 
ing fame." In the clear thinking and or- 
derly method which distinguish his work, 
M. Faguet brings into strong relief Balzac's 
attractive qualities both as a person and a 
novelist his vigor and good-nature, his 
frankness, his generosity, his genius for the 
creation of lifelike and powerful characters. 
But he makes to stand out in still stronger 
relief the great novelist's limitations his 
lack of either personal or moral distinction, to 
say nothing of delicacy, his profound egotism, 
the slightness of his intellectual culture, his 
want of familiarity with all except one section 
of the great social world he was ambitious to 
portray in its entirety in the grandiosely con- 
ceived "Comedie Humaine," the frequent 
and garrulous interpolation of his own loose 
thinking in the business of the narrative, the 
mixing of base romanticism and brutal real- 
ism, the coarseness of his nature and his taste, 
the unreliability of his genius : 

" He had not genius all the time. ... A whole 
literature grew up out of Balzac's cesspools. . . . 
He is responsible for all the easy-going and 
damnable audacity of all the novel-writers who 
pretend to believe that realism lies in the study of 
sinister or shameful abnormality. . . . Ready- 
made romanticism, coarse realism are the two 
things which spoil Balzac's work, the former very 
much and the latter a little. What spoils nearly 
the whole of it is the vulgarity that was inherent 
in the man's nature and crept into nearly every- 
thing he did." 

M. Faguet 's explanation of Balzac's suc- 
cess is a long way from being unreservedly 
complimentary either to the novelist or to his

readers. It was his very faults that made 
him popular: 

" But, if it be true that writers win success 
through their faults, they win it through them 
only on condition that they accompany great 
qualities. . . . Qualities impose on readers, and 
failings hold them; qualities make people admire 
the writer, and failings make them love him; 
qualities inspire veneration, and defects establish 
and maintain intimacy. Now Balzac, perhaps 
more than any of those whom I have just men- 
tioned, had just the genius necessary to impose 
itself, in good earnest, on connoisseurs, rather 
vaguely upon the general reader; while he has 
just enough faults to make himself beloved by the 
mob : and that is how glory is founded." 

The final chapters of the volume, on 
"Taste," "Style," and "Balzac after His 
Death," deal more than the others with uni- 
versals in literary criticism, and are especially 
attractive for that reason. It is unfortunate 
that the translation as a whole is far from 
reproducing the sprightliness, elegance, and 
originality that make the work of M. Faguet 
so pleasing. The volume on Flaubert is bet- 
ter in this respect. 

If M. Faguet is inclined to be harsh with 
Balzac and partial to Flaubert, whom he 
ranks very little below Balzac as a creative 
genius and incomparably higher as an artist 
and writer, it is because for him the ideal 
novelist must not mingle with the great quali- 
ties that inspire veneration the defects that 
establish and maintain intimacy : 

" Flaubert filtered Balzac. A romantic to his 
finger-tips, more so even than Balzac, and like him 
devoured by the demon of observation, his own 
being more patient, more obstinate, and more 
minute than Balzac's, he made up his mind (be- 
cause he was the most ' conscious ' and the most 
deliberate artist in the world) to satisfy both his 
passion as a romantic and his passion as a realist, 
but never to pour both these elements into the 
same novel. It was quite a discovery at the time 
that he wrote, for it meant the remembering of a 
law of literary art which had been for long for- 
gotten or ill understood. It meant remembering 
that the reader, unconsciously, though as impe- 
riously as possible, at all times requires of a work, 
I do not say unity of tone, for that means 
monotony, but unity as regards the general impres- 
sion, and that the mixing up of romantic art for 
instance with realistic art bewilders him, discon- 
certs him, and shocks him just as much as would 
an anachronism or the mixing up of different 
epochs." 

Flaubert was thus alternately romanticist 
and realist, and his novels followed, as re- 
gards the time of their composition, the law 
of action and reaction, the only "law" of 
literary history in which M. Faguet has any 
faith : 



" This law is sufficiently verified by the history 
of French literature. A period of romantic litera- 
ture has always been followed by a period of real- 
istic literature; a time when we demanded of Art 
a lively picture of the truth has always come after 
a period when we enjoyed the magic of the 
imagination." 

But whether indulging his romantic or his 
realistic bent, Flaubert was always consistent, 
and always supremely the artist. His por- 
trait-painting was superior to Balzac's, his 
landscapes of an absolute reality, his alle- 
giance was always to the truth, his language 
was calculated to the utmost degree ; he could 
not bring himself to tolerate in a sentence 
"any break in the rhythm, any dull sounds or 
any beating of the words against each other ' ' ; 
he was the master of the artistic style. 

Flaubert's defects, however, are not al- 
lowed to escape our attention, though their 
critic is less outraged by them than by those 
of Balzac. Flaubert was not a great thinker, 
and not a critic. He disliked authors and 
men whose chief merit lay in ideas, and the 
one literary principle that found permanent 
lodgment in his mind was 

" that literature ought to be ' impersonal,' that is 
to say, that an author should never appear in his 
work; never confide his feelings, his ideas, his 
convictions; never speak as man to man; never, 
even indirectly, allow his ideas or the state of his 
mind to be understood or suspected through his 
writing." 

He was a misanthrope though he thought 
men fools rather than rascals. He was exas- 
perated by human stupidity. His characters 
do not make for themselves the place in the 
memory that Balzac 's hold. This is because he 
is a true realist, however, and sees only the 
truth, which is average humanity. He does 
not know the great scoundrels and perverse 
monsters of Balzac. His tone is almost al- 
ways satirical, though he is kept by the sense 
of truth and the taste for truth from the 
satire that is mean : 

"That suffices to make us grateful to him not only 
as a great painter and a great writer, but also as 
one of those morose and bitter moralists, just nev- 
ertheless, who are something like the harsh con- 
science of humanity." 

M. Faguet 's most serious criticism of Flau- 
bert is found at the end of the chapter on 
"La Tentation de Saint- Antoine": 

"And above all, it bears witness to a prodigious 
effort of which the traces have not yet been wiped 
away and which gives us a sensation of deadly 
fatigue. Flaubert almost always produces that 
effect. Never has he known gay, abundant, happy 
creation, playing with its easy flow and smiling at 
it." 

He is thinking here not only of Flaubert's 
greatest weakness, but of Balzac's greatest

strength. This is a familiar situation: con- 
fronted on the one hand with genius that 
bursts all barriers and overwhelms the formal 
rules of art, and on the other with artistic 
perfection of form which covers a more or 
less uninspired content, the critic feels him- 
self claimed by rival allegiances. Shall it be 
nature or art? If he could only have both at 
the same time! It is little consolation to 
know that the trouble is as old as Horace, and 
as old as art : 

" Natura fieret laudabile carmen an arte, 
Quaesitum est. Ego nee studium sine divite vena, 
Nee rude quid possit video ingenium : alterius sic 
Altera poscit opem res et coniurat amice." 
M. Faguet does not say whether he makes a 
choice, but it is clear enough that he is very 
much repelled by the faults of Balzac, and 
very much attracted by the virtues of Flau- 
bert. Here of course comes to mind what we 
have so often been told about French Ipve of 
logic and of form, French obedience to estab- 
lished rules of art, and French horror of 
irregularity. England's greatest poet is to 
the Frenchman ' ' an irregular genius, now and 
then tasteful and touching, but generally in- 
correct." "On the continent," again says 
Coleridge, "the works of Shakespeare are 
honored in a double way by the admiration 
of the Germans, and by the contempt of the 
French." Is Balzac to meet with the same 
fortune or will German admiration for 
both Balzac and Shakespeare be melted down 
along with British and French medals ?

CRUISING WITH MR. ARNOLD BENXETT.* 



In the days before the war, when the ports 
of Holland, Denmark, France, and Eastern 
England offered happy hunting-ground to 
the wander-loving, holiday-minded wayfarer, 
Mr. Arnold Bennett, author, and Mr. E. A. 
Rickards, artist, fared forth together in the 
good ship "Velsa." The "Velsa" was a 
yacht, "smart" but "not conventional," to 
quote her proud owner, author of the good 
ship's log. For she resembled a very pictur- 
esque Dutch fishing-smack; she carried a 
piano, an encyclopaedia, and wonderful beds, 
but had no promenade deck; she could slide 
over shallows, live in any sea, but manifested 
a "fierce gaiety" before the wind that might 
have disconcerted a less intrepid owner. 
"With a Dutch skipper, who had never lived 
regularly in a house and whose one desire in 
life was to go somewhere else, the "Velsa" 
started on her happy-go-lucky cruise. 

* FROM THE Loo OP THE VELSA. By Arnold Bennett. Illus- 
trated in color, etc., by the author and by E. A. Rickards. 
New York : The Century Co. 



Mr. Bennett has travelled before, and writ- 
ten the log of the journeys for the profit and 
amusement of less gifted observers. He has 
sketched vivid glimpses of Paris nights. He 
has crossed to America and recorded infalli- 
bly entertaining and often highly illumi- 
nating impressions of life on our Eastern 
frontiers. His pastels of London pulse with 
the grim splendor of the world's greatest 
capital. "From the Log of the Velsa" is as 
jaunty as "Your United States" and less 
self-conscious; and, if the strongly dramatic 
quality of the Paris and London sketches is 
generally lacking, there is instead a delight- 
ful rambling informality, a rich variety of 
experience, and a fine zest for those "pleas- 
ant average sights" that, for most of the 
world, exemplify the adventure of living. It 
was a "pleasant average" person who, awed 
by the artistry of "The Old Wives' Tale," 
exclaimed: "That man could make a sneeze 
interesting ! ' ' 

It is the plain people experimenting in 
the essentially romantic adventure of every- 
day living in all the dull little Dutch and 
Danish ports, ports stagnant, tedious, pro- 
vincial, but wistful with the desire for such 
distraction as the " Velsa V visits pro- 
vided, the plain people and the "pleasant 
average sights" that Mr. Bennett went jour- 
neying to see. 

" We passed through Rotterdam more than once, 
without seeing more of it than the amazing traffic 
of its river and its admirable zoological gardens 
full of chromatically inclined parrots; but we 
stopped at a minor town close by, on a canal off 
the Meuse, Schiedam. Instinct must have guided 
me, for the sociological interest of Schiedam was 
not inconsiderable." 

The visit to Schiedam, called by the 
down-right Dutch "stinking Schiedam," 
took place on a Wednesday evening, the night 
of the weekly municipal concert. The tram 
which conveyed the traveller to the centre of 
activity, 

" rumbled and trundled in long curves of subur- 
ban desolation. Then a few miserable shops that 
ought to have been shut; then the square, now 
jammed in every part with a roaring, barbaric 
horde. In the distance, over a floor of heads, was 
an island of illumination, with the figures of 
puffing and blowing musicians in it ; but no rumor 
of music could reach us through the din. The 
white tram-horse trotted mildly into and right 
through the multitude, which jeered angrily, but 
fell back. An enormous multitude, Gothic, Visi- 
gothic, savage, uncivilized, chiefly consisting of 
young men and big boys the weekly concert of 
humanizing music 1 

"I left the tram and walked along the dark, 
empty canal-side to the yacht. The impression of 
stagnation, tedium, provincialism was overwhelm- 



1914]

ing. Nevertheless, here, as in other towns, we 
were struck by the number of shop-windows with 
artist's materials for sale. Such was Schiedam. 
If it is asked whether I went to Holland on a 
yachting cruise to see this sort of thing, the answer 
is that I just did." 

Sometimes it rained inopportunely, and 
sometimes the motor broke down. This hap- 
pened once in Friesland, where "the road is 
water, and all the world is on the road"; and 
the "Velsa's" owner, cook, and deck-hand got 
out to tow, unhappily being obliged to leave 
the skipper, who alone knew how to tow, on 
board. 

" The cook, neurasthenic by temperament, grew 
sad, until he fell into three feet of inundation, 
which adventure struck him as profoundly humor- 
ous, so that he was contorted with laughter. This 
did not advance the yacht. Slowly we learned that 
towing is not mere brute striving, but an art." 

At Hoorn, Mr. Bennett records that he 
" went mad and did eight sketches in one day." 
It should be noted that, while Mr. Rickards 
is official illustrator of the "Velsa's" prog- 
ress, contributing many charming sketches of 
the "pleasant average sights" and amusing 
human phenomena observed by Mr. Bennett, 
the latter gentleman, had he so chosen, might 
have been his own artist. For he belongs to 
that amazing group of all-around geniuses, 
along with Mr. Chesterton, poet-novelist- 
cartoonist, and Mr. Shaw, musieian-pam- 
phleteer-dramatist, who practise all the arts, 
though they excel in one direction. Besides 
furnishing Mr. Rickards with congenial com- 
panionship while he worked, Mr. Bennett 
actually contributes a frontispiece painting of 
Aarhus for the "Velsa's" log-book. 

The impetus to the mad sketching bout at 
Hoorn was furnished by the cheese industry. 

"At Hoorn I saw three men in blue blouses 
throwing down spherical cheeses in pairs from the 
second story of a brown and yellow and green 
ware-house into a yellow cart. One man was in 
the second story, one in the first, and one in the 
cart. They were flinging cheeses from hand to 
hand when we arrived and when we left, and they 
never dropped a cheese or ceased to fling. They 
flung into the mysterious night, when the great 
forms of little cargo-steamers floated soundless 
over romance to moor at the dark quays, and the 
long, white English steam-yacht . . . with its 
myriad lights and gleams, glided to a berth by the 
water-tower, and hung there like a cloud beyond 
the town, keeping me awake half the night while 
I proved to myself that I did not really envy its 
owner." 

In spite of his fondness for dull little 
towns, Mr. Bennett also loves great cities 
not for their museums or historic monuments 
but for their quality of pulsing, noisy, throng- 
ing life. And because ' ' the din, the elbowing, 



the glitter ' ' of city-life is at its best in the cafes 
and restaurants, Mr. Bennett is a connois- 
seur of cafes. He finds those of Amsterdam 
"prodigious" and satisfying. Copenhagen 
from the harbor he describes as "a bou- 
quet of copper domes," and he admires it as 
"a proud city . . . where exposed copper 
turns to a beautiful green instead of to black, 
as in London," and as a city of beautiful 
women. At Boulogne, where the "Velsa" 
was imprisoned by a gale, Mr. Bennett bought 
eels, ate them "with ecstasy," and made 
friends with the herring fishers. He dined in 
Bruges, after an absence of twenty years, and 
after dinner, "almost saturated with the ex- 
quisite melancholy of the Grande Place, we 
were too enchanted to move. ' ' 

As the log of the "Velsa" was written 
down some time before Europe went to war, 
Mr. Bennett can of course have had no inten- 
tion of producing a peace document. But as 
one reads of these leisurely, happy cruises 
through seas now grimly guarded and tragic 
with war-horrors, to ports now scarred with 
ramparts or stained with blood and ruin, one 
is filled with indignation and regret. No 
cruise for the "Velsa" this autumn; no such 
perfect holiday-making as her ship's com- 
pany have hitherto enjoyed, for years to come. 
The pity of it is but a minor note in the great 
chorus of war-misery ; but to some of us, who 
have found our ideal holidays across the sea, 
the spoiling of the "pleasant average sights" 
there brings poignant sadness.

TRAVEL AND DESCRIPTION. 

If you wish to " see America first," and that, 
too, without leaving your own comfortable arm- 
chair and cheerful fireside, read "Abroad at Home" 
(Century Co.), being "the American ramblings, 
observations, and adventures of Julian Street, 
with pictorial sidelights by Wallace Morgan." 
Brisk and snappy in its style, the book shows keen 
powers of observation in its author and an envia- 
ble command of the American language (which, 
of course, is the English language at its best, in 
certain respects). Mr. Street's frequent invoca- 
tion of apt alliteration's artful aid appears con- 
spicuously in the table of contents, where headings 
like " Bifurcated Buffalo," " Cleveland Character- 
istics," "Detroit the Dynamic," "Automobiles and 
Art," "Somnolent St. Louis," and "Pike and 
Poker," meet the eye in abundance. His sight- 
seeing journey began at New York and ended at 
San Francisco, and its interest for him lay rather 
in the haunts and habits of men than in the unsub- 
dued wilds of nature. His artist-companion has 
ably seconded his endeavors to produce an attrac-

tive book, though the drawings content themselves 
with being suggestive sketches, and are not fin- 
ished works of art a fact that has doubtless 
helped to make possible their lavish abundance. 

The season's " wanderer " book from the pen of 
Mr. E. V. Lucas bears the title "A Wanderer in 
Venice " (Macmillan). It is neither a guide nor an 
historical study; like the earlier volumes, on 
Florence, Paris, London, and Holland, its aim is to 
kindle enthusiasm, to create a taste. His mood is 
varied, but always he suggests that Venice above 
all cities must be enjoyed leisurely. Now he takes 
the reader conscientiously to the Accademia, pre- 
pared for a careful study of its Titians, Tintorettos, 
Leonardos, or Bellinis; again he steals away to S. 
Stefano, highly esteemed by him among the city's 
churches because it is pleasant and comfortable and 
offers " a harbour of refuge from pictures," since it 
contains none that need be too diligently scruti- 
nized. He writes of a Venice that is passing, a 
Venice of motor-boats instead of gondoliers, of 
cinema theatres crowded in among its ancient ruins, 
or of gramophones that have replaced the Venetian 
minstrel; with equal faithfulness and good-humor 
he deals with the Venice Byron loved, or Browning, 
or Buskin, or Shelley. In whimsical fashion he 
exclaims at the end of his account : " Where many 
books could not exhaust the theme, what chance has 
only one? . . . Venice needs a whole library to 
describe her: a book on her churches and a book 
on her sculptors ; a book on her old families and a 
book on her new; a book on her builders and a 
book on her bridges ; a book on but why go on ? " 
Something of all this he does offer, however, in 
friendly, sociable, holiday mood. The illustrations 
in color are by Mr. Harry Morley; they furnish 
delightful glimpses of the city. Those in monotone 
are the more conventional reproductions of famous 
masterpieces that many guide-books on art contain. 

Tired of the sight of strap-hanging money- 
chasers, bargain-hunting shoppers, dissipated 
pleasure-seekers, and all the throng of other famil- 
iar types composing a great city's population, and 
feeling themselves at early middle age as jaded as 
if they had been on the verge of senility, Mr. 
Charles Tenney Jackson and a companion whom 
he calls " Hen " set out in quest of the fountain 
of youth, not in Florida, but in the same latitude 
in the swamps and lagoons of Barataria Bay, 
about fifty miles south of New Orleans. The ad- 
ventures of these two men in a boat (which was a 
swamp pirogue, a kind of craft never before 
pressed into the service of so long a cruise) are 
related in lively, idiomatic style by Mr. Jackson, 
with many illustrations from photographs, in a 
book called "The Fountain of Youth" (Outing 
Publishing Co.), which will appeal to the large 
and increasing number of those who find their 
keenest delight in the wide outdoors of unspoiled 
nature. And the natives of Barataria, as pre- 
sented by the author, are as little corrupted by 
civilization as heart could desire. 

If there is anyone who knows his Boston better 
than Mr. Edwin M. Bacon, author of various 
handy and useful books about that historic town, 
the fact has not been made apparent through the 
printing-press. To his previous kindred works 



Mr. Bacon now adds "Rambles around Old 
Boston" (Little, Brown & Co.), a leisurely, gos- 
sipy, anecdotal sort of book, carrying the reader 
back to the Old Colony days, and then into the 
provincial period and so on to the Boston of 
revolutionary times and of final severance from 
the mother country of which the city of crooked 
streets is more reminiscent than is any other in the 
country. Mr. Bacon does well to distinguish, in 
his retrospect, between the Colony period and the 
Province period a distinction often neglected by 
our historians and antiquaries. In his pages are 
interesting accounts of the old landmarks, 
Faneuil Hall, the historic Common (where open 
pasturage continued until 1830), the Old North 
Church and the Old South Church, King's Chapel, 
Copp's Hill Burying Ground, India Wharf, and 
other relics of the past, many of them no longer 
in existence. Good drawings are furnished by 
Mr. Lester G. Hornby, who shows himself to be 
in sympathy with his theme. All that this notable 
and handsome book needs to make it wholly satis- 
fying is an index. But perhaps this lack will 
encourage a more diligent and consecutive reading 
of the volume. 

" Highways and Byways in Lincolnshire " 
(Macmillan) is more faithful to the first part of 
its title than many another of the numerous 
" highways and byways " books, for its author, 
Mr. Willingham Franklin Rawnsley, has travelled 
by motor-car the highways that he describes, and 
he confines himself closely enough to the broader 
and the narrower avenues which his book-title sug- 
gests. Lincolnshire is a large county, for England, 
and the description runs to corresponding length 
(more than five hundred pages), with many excel- 
lent drawings by Mr. Frederick L. Griggs. Old 
Boston, with its famous church and church-tower, 
the "Boston stump," figures rather prominently 
and very interestingly in the book. It is this 
church that has been chosen to furnish a frontis- 
piece for the volume. History and tradition and 
anecdote combine with topographical description 
to make a variously attractive book. A folding 
map of the county, showing the main roads in red, 
and apparently all the towns, with the network of 
railways, follows the index, which is also a thor- 
ough piece of work. 

Parody, poetry, pungency, persiflage, and sun- 
dry other constituent elements, not all beginning 
with p, go to the making of a humorously enter- 
taining book in Mr. Maurice Baring's " Round the 
World in Any Number of Days" (Houghton). 
Starting from Tilbury in June, he chased the 
dawn, in leisurely stages, by way of Gibraltar, the 
Suez Canal, Australia, San Francisco, and New 
York, where the chronicle ends under date of Octo- 
ber. Of chief interest to most American readers 
are the observations on America. "A street boy, a 
child, in New York," says Mr. Baring in generous 
acknowledgment of our alertness, " is more nimble- 
minded, more agile in thought and expression, 
than the quickest-witted Englishman. He will 
have got there and be walking round him in 
thought before the Englishman has begun to ex- 
press himself." He pays tribute to our baggage- 
checking system, and otherwise shows himself to

be not hopelessly prejudiced in favor of the Euro- 
pean way of doing things. Amusing drawings by 
two clever illustrators help to leave one in no 
doubt that the book is not a volume of sermons. 

A country has as many aspects as there are 
pairs of eyes to view it. An American girl's way 
of looking at things Japanese, Chinese, and Philip- 
pine, is agreeably presented in Miss M. Leola 
Crawford's " Seven Weeks in the Orient," a com- 
panion volume to her earlier " Seven Weeks in 
Hawaii." Yokohama, Tokyo, Kyoto, Canton, 
Hong Kong, and Manila, with occasional less im- 
portant and less-known places, were visited by 
Miss Crawford and her companion, and the ac- 
count of things seen shows the writer to be alive 
to all that ought to interest a touring American 
woman, and the mistress of a literary style ade- 
quate to the needs of the occasion. Rich and 
varied is her equipment of adjectives no super- 
fluous furniture in the gorgeous Orient but she 
rather exceeds the demands of the situation when 
she writes of " the most extreme southern part of 
Kyoto." Sixty-eight pictures from photographs 
enliven the narrative, but one wishes that a de- 
scriptive word or two had been printed beneath 
each illustration. The book is published by Mr. 
Howard D. Berrett, 518 Wrightwood Avenue, 
Chicago. 

Even into Mr. W. Barnes Steveni's peaceful pic- 
ture of " Things Seen in Sweden " (Button) there 
has crept a suggestion of militarism in the author's 
reference to Sweden's preparedness for the possi- 
ble invader. " Shooting competitions are organ- 
ized on such a scale that this little nation, with a 
population less than that of London, will soon be 
ready to take up the challenge of a much larger 
Power, if necessary." The book, a compact duo- 
decimo, is almost as rich in half-tone illustrations 
of much beauty and interest as it is in reading mat- 
ter. Mr. Steveni emphasizes the charms of Sweden, 
too often overlooked by tourists in favor of the 
more familiar attractions of Norway or Switzer- 
land, Denmark, Holland, or France. In calling 
attention to the great stretch of diversified territory 
included in the kingdom, he gives the total length 
of the country as twelve hundred miles, which 
looks like an exaggeration by about two hundred 
miles, unless the geographies are at fault. Geog- 
raphy, ethnology, climatology, with other matters 
having less learned names, have gone into the 
making of a good and useful book in this pocket 
handbook of Sweden. 

Many fine examples of half-tone illustration, 
with a smaller number of colored plates from paint- 
ings by Mr. Chris Jb'rgensen, have gone to the 
making of Mr. John H. Williams's imposing vol- 
ume, " Yosemite and Its High Sierra." Expert 
amateur photographers in the Sierra Club, with 
some professional camera artists, have contributed 
these unusually striking views of mountain scenery. 
It is true that the Yosemite Valley has been repro- 
duced in illustration to the point of weariness, but 
the High Sierra back of it is a less hackneyed 
theme. Mr. Williams's descriptive text necessarily 
takes a subordinate place in so splendidly illus- 
trated a work. A blue tint is used in the pictures 
from photographs, while Mr. Jb'rgensen's work 



seems to have been skilfully reproduced by the 
color-printer. The book is published by Mr. 
Williams at Tacoma and San Francisco. 

Those to whom cathedrals, churches, abbeys, and 
monasteries are the most interesting features of 
the European landscape will thoroughly enjoy 
Mr. Michael Barrett's "Rambles in Catholic 
Lands" (Benziger Bros.), a record of travel 
through southern Germany, Austria, the Tyrol, 
and northern Italy, with especial attention to the 
sacred edifices representing the religious faith of 
the chronicler. Many places not included in the 
ordinary tourist's itinerary become objects of in- 
terest in Mr. Barrett's pages. Einsiedeln, with its 
famous monastery and college, Fiecht, with its 
abbey, Volders, with its religious house where the 
monks of Beuron found temporary refuge on 
being expelled from Prussia, are among these less 
fashionable resorts of sight-seers. Venice, Fer- 
rara, and Florence are the Italian cities visited by 
the author. Many beautiful tinted views from 
photographs emphasize the attractions of the route 
chosen by him, and these illustrations are by no 
means confined to churches and abbeys. 

HOLIDAY ART BOOKS. 

In the main room of what was once the Bishop's 
Palace at Bayeux in Normandy there is to be seen, 
wrought in tapestry, a pictorial representation of 
the Norman conquest of England. " The Book of 
the Bayeux Tapestry" (Putnam) contains seventy- 
six colored panels which collectively reproduce 
as accurately as may be this famous picture-story 
of one of the chief episodes in English history. 
Mr. Hilaire Belloe writes an Introduction and a 
running commentary to the quaint pageant. He 
assigns to the tapestry a date not later than 1200 r 
and not earlier than 1140, A.D. And in his notes, 
wisely restricted in number, he allows himself a 
sharp hit at the learned historian of the Norman 
Conquest, thus : " The Tapestry, of course, does 
not show Freeman's famous ' Palisade,' and that 
for an excellent reason. The Palisade never ex- 
isted outside the imagination of Oxford." A map 
of Normandy and southeastern England opens the 
book, which is in every respect an unusually fine 
example of the printer's, the illustrator's, and the 
binder's combined arts. 

As if in celebration of the eightieth birthday of 
Major Henry Lee Higginson, whose zeal and gen- 
erosity have done so much for Boston's most 
famous musical organization, there comes from the 
press an historical sketch, by Mr. M. A. DeWolfe 
Howe, of " The Boston Symphony Orchestra " 
(Houghton), from its beginnings under Georg 
Henschel in 1881-84 to its present approximation 
to artistic perfection under Dr. Karl Muck. 
There is something pathetic in Mr. Howe's picture 
of the benefactor's early disablement as a musician 
in his own person and his subsequent and, one 
may add, consequent eagerness to make neverthe- 
less his mark in the world of music by endowing 
with the pecuniary product of his commercial 
activities an orchestra worthy of the city where 
he makes his home. For a book modestly described 
by its author as " not the work of a musical critic, 
but of an editor and annalist," the present volume

shows an admirable grasp of its subject, going 
into various details that might not have been ex- 
pected. Appended pages give lists of soloists, of 
the entire personnel of the Orchestra, and of its 
repertoire. Illustrations and an index complete 
the book's equipment. 

The celebrated chimes of the Low Countries 
have never been the object of greater interest 
in no small part an anxious interest than at the 
present time. Mr. William Gorham Rice offers 
therefore a seasonable book in his " Carillons of 
Belgium and Holland: Tower Music in the Low 
Countries" (Lane), a systematic and apparently 
accurate account of all the more important chimes 
whose aerial harmonies typify, to Mr. Rice at 
least, the peculiar charm of this part of Europe. 
But he would caution us not to confuse the chime, 
which is attuned to intervals of the diatonic scale, 
with the carillon, which has a chromatic scale and 
a consequent greater number of bells than the 
chime, and richer musical possibilities. Somewhat 
of a pioneer in his researches, the author has 
delved for information in the libraries of various 
lands, besides receiving aid from many persons 
who share his affection and admiration for the 
Dutch and Flemish peoples. Photographic repre- 
sentations of famous bell-towers and their groups 
of bells, with a map of the " carillon region " and 
a page of carillon music, enrich the volume, which 
also has appended matter of statistical, historical, 
and technical interest. Unusually attractive in 
many ways is this well-planned and well-executed 
volume. 

Initiation into the mysteries of the oriental rug 
is offered in reasonably brief form, and with a 
generous accompaniment of pictured examples of 
this branch of art, by Dr. G. Griffin Lewis in a vol- 
ume of ample page-dimensions, well suited to the 
purposes of graphic illustration. " The Mystery 
of the Oriental Rug" (Lippincott) is less elabo- 
rate and hence much less expensive than the same 
author's " Practical Book of Oriental Rugs," but 
it contains the essentials desired by those knowing 
little on the subject and wishing to learn more at 
a small expense of time and money. Descriptions 
of the thirty plates in the book are appended. 
Smaller illustrations are interspersed in the read- 
ing matter, and a colored frontispiece shows the 
splendors of a silk prayer-rug from Ispahan. 
"With the fast-diminishing opportunity to procure 
genuine antiques in eastern rugs, Dr. Griffin's book 
is one to study and profit by now or never. 

Mrs. Eliza Calvert Hall's notable work of two 
years ago, "A Book of Hand-woven Coverlets" 
(Little, Brown & Co.), which was commended by 
us upon its first appearance, is now offered, in all 
its original excellence of typography and beauti- 
ful, colored illustrations, at a- greatly reduced 
price. Thus brought within reach of a larger 
number of purchasers, it should enjov a new lease 
of life. 

Unlike " The Honest House," already noticed by 
us, " Country Houses " (Doubleday) exhibits the 
work of a single architect, Mr. Aymar Embury, 
2nd, or as he writes it, after the fashion of reign- 
ing dynasties, Aymar Embury II. Mr. Henry H. 
Say lor selects and edits the plans that are illus- 



trated on the book's spacious pages, and he also 
writes an explanatory 'and appreciative Introduc- 
tion, which is followed by a shorter preliminary 
note by Mr. Embury himself. Few architects have 
given more study than he to a branch of their art 
that is rather notoriously ill-paid as compared with 
the designing of business blocks and public build- 
ings. Still young in years, Mr. Embury has won 
wide recognition for his skill and taste in domestic 
architecture. The book's illustrations show exte- 
rior views (one or two of each house), floor plans, 
and an occasional interior. Brief explanatory 
notes are given here and there. The large, clean- 
cut half-tones are a delightfto the eye. 

Following partly as a sequel to Dean Spence- 
Jones's " Handbook to Gloucester Cathedral," 
though independent in character, the same au- 
thor's book on " The Secrets of a Great Cathedral " 
(Dutton) is intended as an answer to " the leading 
questions which are often put to the writer, who is 
the chief custodian of a great pile, partly Roman- 
esque, partly Gothic, as to the signification and 
origin of certain prominent features of an impor- 
tant Mediaeval Church." These questions concern 
the meaning and history of the term Romanesque 
as applied to architecture; they also have to do 
with the Lady Chapel, the Crypt, the Cloister, and 
Saint Petronilla, with other matters of interest to 
students of church architecture and church history. 
Illustrations help to make clear the author's mean- 
ing, and a full index closes the book. The Dean of 
Gloucester shows himself to be an ardent student in 
his department of research, and his writings are 
authoritative. 

HOLIDAY EDITIONS OF STANDARD LITERATURE. 

Hans Breitmann is still popular enough to in- 
sure a welcome for the complete edition of the 
amusing " Ballads," with an Introduction by the 
author's niece and biographer, Mrs. Joseph Pen- 
nell. Most of us owe our acquaintance with Breit- 
mann to some imperfect and perhaps pirated 
edition of the verses bearing his name; hence our 
satisfaction at finding him procurable in full in 
the tasteful octavo issued (in a limited edition, one 
regrets to add) by the Houghton Mifflin Co., with 
the title, "Hans Breitmann's Ballads." Charles 
Godfrey Leland died while his German-American 
hero was still one of the best-known characters in 
imaginative literature. His niece predicts a re- 
vival of his popularity, though it may be that not 
all English-speaking readers are just now in the 
best mood to enjoy the strong German flavor of 
these admirable ballads. The present edition is of 
pleasing design, and is provided with slip-case 
and box. 

By no means new to her readers are the poems 
collected in Laurence Hope's " India's Love Lyrics, 
including The Garden of Kama" (Lane). In fact, 
the collection has gone through a number of edi- 
tions, but not till now has it found its predestined 
illustrator, Mr. Byam Shaw, himself a native of 
India and thus more likely than another to have 
breathed in the spirit that animates the poems. 
Twenty-four richly colored plates, with smaller 
designs interspersed, fittingly illustrate the two 
hundred (or somewhat fewer, to be exact) love

lyrics from Laurence Hope's facile pen. Amorous 
passion in its intensity, described with oriental 
wealth of imagery, is of course the prevailing 
theme. Royal quarto in its dimensions, the vol- 
ume admits of the most liberal indulgence in wide 
margins, large type, ample illustration, and unre- 
stricted decoration, although the printed pages are 
rather sparingly embellished by the artist. Few 
more striking productions have come from the 
press this season. 

For the first time Thoreau's essay on "Walking," 
which first appeared in " The Atlantic Monthly " 
for June, 1862, and was soon afterward included 
in the volume entitled " Excursions," is published 
in separate form. It makes a little book of one 
hundred pages in the Riverside Press series of lim- 
ited editions. Thoreau believed that the walker is 
born, not made ("Ambulator nascitur, non fit"), 
and his praise of pedestrianism is one of the class- 
ics in its kind. Never was eloquent essay of the 
sort more needed than in this present age of motor- 
car madness. Back to nature and the natural 
method of locomotion, is its lesson. (Houghton.) 

Already one artist's not unsuccessful attempt to 
picture to the eye the more noteworthy scenes of 
"A Midsummer Night's Dream " has been noted by 
us among the more elaborately illustrated books of 
the season. A second essay in the same inviting 
field, on the part of Mr. W. Heath Robinson, claims 
equal attention and commendation. In a handsome 
quarto of nearly two hundred pages, his numerous 
full-page designs, colored and plain, show to excel- 
lent advantage. The colored plates have each a 
predominant tint, and appeal to the sense of beauty 
and charm, while the black-and-white illustrations 
place more emphasis on the comic element of the 
poet's work. Broad margins, large type, appro- 
priate cover design, and other details are such as 
to satisfy the aesthetic sense. Messrs. Henry Holt 
& Co. publish the book. 

A reissue of Mr. Kenneth Grahame's already 
oft-reprinted story of his boyhood, " The Golden 
Age" (Lane), is justified by the charm of that 
admirable narrative, a charm felt by backward- 
looking maturity rather than by eagerly expectant 
youth. The book is too wise, too sophisticated, too 
frank in its humorous acknowledgment of child- 
hood's delightful illusions, to win the confidence of 
the young people, tremendously serious as they are 
in their view of things. The illustrator of this 
sumptuous edition of Mr. Grahame's masterpiece 
is Mr. R. J. E. Moony, whose full-page drawings 
are resplendent with the hues appropriate to such 
iridescent memories of the morning of life. The 
light that never was, on sea or land, illumines both 
the narrative and its pictorial accompaniment. 
Golden ships of antique design sail over the book's 
broad cover, and colored borders set off the hand- 
somely printed text. 

A new printing of the modern prose English 
version of Chaucer, by Professor John S. P. Tat- 
lock and Mr. Percy MacKaye, with illustrations 
by Mr. Warwick Goble, comes from the Macmil- 
lan Co. in ocular demonstration of the deserved 
success of this readable paraphrase of a too-much 
neglected classic. Two years have passed since the 
first publication of this, the only complete, prose 



rendering in modern English of Chaucer's poetical 
works; and in that time it has evidently won its 
way into favor with at least some portion of the 
reading public. 

Christmas without a newly illustrated edition of 
Dickens's " Carol " would hardly be Christmas at 
all in the book-world. This year the illustrator is 
Mr. Arthur I. Keller, and of his dozen full-page 
pictures eight have the true holiday appearance 
imparted by unstinted use of cheerful colors. 
Smaller drawings head the five successive " staves ' r 
of the " Christmas Carol," and a bright binding 
and ornamented box help to attract attention to 
the book. (David McKay.) 

HOLIDAY FICTION. 

Appropriate to the season is Miss Sehna Lager- 
Ib'f's story, "The Legend of the Sacred Image " 
(Holt), translated by Miss Velma Swanston How- 
ard. An aged peasant couple's faith in the mir- 
aculous power of a certain crucifix in the cathedral 
at Lucca is the theme of the legend, which ends 
with the granting of the old people's wish as 
devoutly expressed in prayer at the foot of the 
sacred image. The story is simply and pleasingly 
told in a dainty white volume that comes in a pro- 
tecting case, the whole being of pocket size. 

Three Christmas stories by Miss Leona Dalrym- 
ple make their appearance this season, either as 
new or reprinted for the occasion. " Uncle Noah's 
Christmas Inspiration " pictures the unselfish devo- 
tion of an old negro servant to his former master 
and mistress, impoverished by the war. His 
" inspiration " procures the family a Christmas 
turkey and is the prelude to other even more joy- 
ous results. "Uncle Noah's Christmas Party " 
introduces once more some of the characters so- 
agreeably depicted in the earlier book, but it is 
hardly equal to that first story in interest. The 
party is given in a barn by the resourceful old 
negro, the year after the events narrated in the 
" Inspiration," and it is attended by sundry occur- 
rences of a glad and surprising nature. " In the 
Heart of the Christmas Pines" is a pretty and 
touching story of love reciprocated, with other 
pleasing incidents thrown in for full measure. The 
heroine contrives to make the acquaintance of her 
future mother-in-law without revealing the pros- 
pective relationship, and is wholly pleased with 
what she thus discovers. All three books have col- 
ored pictures and cheerful decorations, and are 
published by Messrs. McBride, Nast & Co. 

Of Christmas stories there is fortunately no lack 
this season. "Little Merry Christmas" (Revell), 
by Miss Winifred Arnold, tells of the happy trans- 
formation of Uncle Lemuel Perkins, alias "Grouchy 
Gruff," by his fascinating little niece, Mary Chris- 
tie, who also has a nickname, " Little Merry 
Christmas." Four scenes in the story are pictured 
by the artist. In " How It Happened " (Harper) f 
by Mrs. Kate Langley Bosher, one reads how two 
lovers were parted by a mere difference of opinion, 
and brought together again for a wedding on 
Christmas day by a bright, loving, unselfish child, 
Carmencita, worthy successor in our affections to 
the same author's Mary Gary. The book is illus- 
trated. "The Rejuvenation of Father Christ-

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16 



mas" (Pilgrim Press), by Mr. J. Edgar Park, 
shows us the salutary change of old Santa Glaus 
into a younger and more useful member of society ; 
that is, Father Christmas, with his traditional stock 
of shop-worn gifts, becomes Brother Christmas, 
preaching the doctrine of "peace through good- 
will " every day in the year until Christmas eve, 
when he is allowed to resume his ancient role and 
bestow presents for the mere joy of giving. Of 
course there are pictures to point the moral and 
adorn the tale. The practiced hand of Mrs. Mary 
Stewart Cutting turns itself readily to the telling 
of a Christmas tale in " The Blossoming Rod " 
(Doubleday), the story of a father's little family 
worries and troubles upon the approach of the 
annual gift-giving day, and of his glad surprise in 
receiving just the gift he most desired, a trout rod. 
That it was his own money, handed out in reluctant 
driblets to his wife and children, that paid for the 
rod, gives point to the story. A colored frontis- 
piece and decorations in green embellish the book. 

MISCELLANEOUS HOLIDAY BOOKS. 

No Christmas season is complete without a book 
on happiness. This year Mr. Robert Haven 
Schauffler collects a number of his periodical 
essays in praise of cheerfulness and enthusiasm, 
and adds two new ones, grouping them all under 
the title. "The Joyful Heart" (Houghton) and 
explaining in his Preface that the volume is " a 
guide-book to joy " and " a manual of enthusi- 
asm." Probably it is about as difficult to teach 
happiness as to teach English literature, as to 
which latter the author says, in a chapter ad- 
dressed to poets : " One shudders to think of all 
the fellowship money which is now being used to 
finance reluctant young dry-as-dusts while they 
are preparing to pack still tighter the already 
overcrowded ranks of 'professors of English lit- 
erature' whose profession, as Mr. Gerald Stanley 
Lee justly remarks, is founded on the striking 
principle that a very great book can be taught by 
a very little man." Still, there are such things as 
helpful hints to readers of English literature, and 
some books there are that give useful suggestions 
to seekers after happiness; and Mr. Schauffler's 
volume is one of these. 

Dr. Hugh Black's contribution to this season's 
books has the qualities that have already made him 
a favorite with those who look for moral stimulus 
and a serious consideration of ethical questions in 
their reading. Undeterred by the fact that already 
two works of fiction bear the title, " The Open 
Door," he chooses that name for his thoughtful 
volume, which considers, successively, the open 
door of our unfolding existence, the laws of the 
open door (which are the law of faith and the law 
of fitness), the shut door of the past, the door- 
ways of tradition, the magic door of youth, the 
lure of the open door, the door of opportunity, 
the adventure of the open door, and the last open 
door, leading from this to a future life. Apt 
illustration and quotation enrich the several chap- 
ters, but Dr. Johnson would have looked a little 
more natural if the printer had not given him a 
superfluous " t." The book is one to read in as 
opportunity offers. (Fleming H. Revell Co.) 



Confident affirmation rather than convincing 
demonstration is to be found in Mr. Howard 
Sutherland's little book, " The Promise of Life " 
(Rand, McNally & Co.), a consideration of the 
question of a future existence. " The fact that we 
were alive yesterday," says the author, " and that 
we enjoy to-day, should convince us of what we 
call Immortality." And again : " How can there 
be an end to life? It is the divine mood made 
manifest." Mr. Sutherland holds that " the con- 
sciousness of eternal life as natural law must be 
inborn, and . . . some are surer of it than others." 
Admitting thus the futility of attempting any 
proof, he nevertheless speaks with a firmness of 
faith that will produce its effect on his readers. 
The book is beautifully printed and neatly bound. 

The country house of Mr. and Mrs. Egerton 
Castle, " high on the southern moorlands of Sur- 
rey," is the theme of a pleasing volume from their 
pens entitled " Our Sentimental Garden " (Lip- 
pincott). Chat about their pet animals, their 
flowers and fruits and trees, the memories and 
imaginings that come to them in their " little para- 
dise on the hill," and all sorts of whims and fan- 
cies, go to fill the two-score chapters of this sunny 
volume, which, begun light-heartedly in days of 
peace, is now sent forth in the hope that, " as a 
sprig of Lavender, or a Cowslip, by his pillow 
might for a moment relieve the blood-tinted vision 
of a stricken soldier, so, perhaps, some unquiet 
heart labouring under the strain of long-drawn 
suspense, will find a passing relaxation, a forgot- 
ten smile," in the scenes and characters of " Our 
Sentimental Garden." Mr. Charles Robinson sup- 
plies eight appropriate and beautiful colored pic- 
tures and innumerable dainty drawings in the text. 

What the philosophers and the poets have told 
us over and over again, and what one poet in par- 
ticular has well said in the words, " Self -rever- 
ence, self-knowledge, self-control, these three 
alone lead life to sovereign power," is the sum and 
substance of Mr. Vance Thompson's whimsical but 
pleasing little volume, " The Ego Book " (Dutton) , 
which he further calls " a book of selfish ideals." 
But if we hold with Polonius that to be true to 
others one must first be true to oneself, the seem- 
ingly selfish ideal may be only the unselfish ideal 
viewed from another side. Be on good terms with 
your own ego, the author repeatedly urges us, and 
rest assured that the world is his who masters him- 
self. This lesson Mr. Thompson contrives to teach 
through clever illustration and fanciful imagery. 

Calm cogency, sweet reasonableness, propitiatory 
gentleness, anger-dispelling humor, and playful 
nimbleness of wit are the agreeable character- 
istics of Dr. Samuel McChord Crothers's " Medita- 
tions on Votes for Women" (Houghton). One 
great advantage of meditation over disputation is 
that " we are not required to reach any predeter- 
mined conclusions. We have no nervous anxiety to 
catch any particular train of thought, as we are 
travelling on our own feet, and are willing to put 
up wherever the night finds us." He who meditates 
is permitted to dwell, if he chooses, on the things 
that " go without saying," and he thus assures him- 
self, if not others, that they are still going. Mr. 
Crothers finds that " equal suffrage is not the first

step in an impending revolution, but only a neces- 
sary adjustment to the results of a revolution that 
has already happened," and that " the driving 
power of the movement for equal suffrage is not 
Feminism but democracy." Entertaining and not 
unconvincing is the author's argument, from the 
Bible and other authoritative sources, that the 
"new" woman is as old as the human race. He does 
not profess to remove " the weighty practical diffi- 
culties in the way of woman suffrage," but he helps 
to allay the anxieties of those whose pet nightmare 
takes the form of " Votes for Women." 

Rose-lovers will enjoy the sumptuous plates in 
color and half-tone found in " The Practical Book 
of Outdoor Rose Growing for the Home Garden " 
(Lippincott), prepared by Mr. George C. Thomas, 
Jr. Rose-growers will find equal satisfaction in the 
accompanying text, which furnishes adequate sug- 
gestions to the amateur regarding the ordering of 
roses, their planting and cultivation, together with 
general advice on hybridization. The author is 
himself well-known as a successful amateur rose- 
grower. His field of experimentation has been re- 
stricted to America, and the information presented 
in this volume has as its base the approximate 
climate of the Middle Atlantic States, with ap- 
pended directions for rose-growing farther north 
and farther south. 

Those who regret the lack of detail with which 
Gospel incidents are related will greet with ap- 
proval Mr. C. R. Blackall's elaboration of the story 
of blind Bartimeus. " The Son of Timeus " 
(Jacobs) mainly follows the account given in 
St. Mark, and evident care has been taken to make 
the historical setting and other details as correct as 
possible. As thus elaborated, the story's chief 
characters, besides Bartimeus, are his mother, 
Hamama, his brother Nathan, his sister Rachel, a 
kinsman, a rabbi, and a few others. Jericho, 
Emmaus, and Jerusalem are the scenes of the 
various incidents. Excellent drawings accompany 
the narrative, and the whole is printed in brown, 
with decorated cover to match. 

The poet laureate of North Dakota, Mr. James 
W. Foley, offers another welcome collection of his 
hilarious and hearty verses in rural dialect, under 
the title, "Tales of the Trail" (Button). In this 
" book of western verse," as its sub-title styles it, 
the author strengthens his claim to be ranked with 
those older poets of the West, Eugene Field and 
Mr. James Whitcomb Riley. His lines have the 
unmistakable ring of large-hearted geniality and 
abounding humor. Nearly four-score pieces are 
given, with admirably illustrative drawings, and this 
is how the last poem, " The Forum," ends : 

" Down to Hicks's grocery store, 
I allow we've settled more 
Burnin' questions in a night 
Than the courts an' done it right. 
Hicks, he allus keeps in touch 
With the world's crowned heads an' such, 
An' there's very little goes 
On abroad but what he knows. 

But he says to Treadwell Pew 

' Who'll I charge them herrings to ? '" 

Dog-lovers, of whom luckily there is no lack, 
will hail approvingly the handsome edition now 



issued of Mr. John Galsworthy's story of his 
canine pet, Chris. First published in " The Inn 
of Tranquillity," this intimate history of a dog 
has not hitherto been procurable in separate form. 
" Memories " is the rather inadequate title it bears, 
but its other and more positive qualities atone for 
the want of character in the title. Miss Maud 
Earl contributes nearly thirty colored and uncol- 
ored pictures of our four-footed hero in various 
aspects. Chris shows himself deserving of an 
affection little if any less warm than that accorded 
to Dr. John Brown's Rab, to Mr. John Muir's 
Stickeen, and to other immortal representatives of 
doggish virtues. The book is a thin quarto of 
handsome design, its full-page plates being espe- 
cially striking. (Scribner.) 

" Reader, comfortable armchair reader, bilious 
morning-train reader, have you ever posed ? " asks 
Mr. W. R. Titterton in the early pages of his book, 
" Me as a Model " (Kennerley) . It is a book of 
Bohemian reminiscences, of art-student life in 
Paris, of things that are " neither fact nor fiction," 
the author tells us, but " the golden mean between 
them which the conscientious writer must ever seek 
to find." He declares it is not autobiography, and 
yet hints that it may be something not altogether 
unlike autobiography, and so mystifies and tanta- 
lizes us to his heart's content. Let us call the book 
a dish of scrambled eggs and not try to unscramble 
them. Verse as well as prose goes to its making, 
and a sufficiency of French, largely interjectional 
and expletive, is sprinkled in italics through the 
pages. Mr. Edmund Blampied does his part to our 
satisfaction in three colored drawings and thirty- 
seven uncolored ones, the latter being rather better 
than the former. He who opens the book in quest 
of light entertainment will not be disappointed. 

Mr. Lawrence B. Saint has had the courage to 
undertake what might be called a second " Pil- 
grim's Progress" in his parable of spiritual 
adventure and spiritual conquest entitled "A 
Knight of the Cross" (Jacobs), wherein the hero, 
none other than Christian, makes his way, amid 
various significant happenings, from the Lodge of 
Spiritual Service to Emanuel's Land and the 
King's City. This undisguised imitation of Bun- 
yan, even to the quaintly descriptive proper 
names, inevitably invites comparison with the mas- 
terpiece endeared to so many readers from child- 
hood; and one may question the discretion while 
admiring the courage of the accomplished author. 
But let each read and judge for himself. Mr. 
Saint's talents include a gift for illustrating, and 
his colored plates and decorative designs give the 
book an inviting appearance. 

This is the fitting season in which to read and 
heed the lesson of Miss Margaret Slattery's little 
book, "He Took It upon Himself" (Pilgrim 
Press). The examples of Horace Mann, Dr. 
Barnardo, Jacob Riis, Judge Lindsey, Mr. Ernest 
Coulter, Miss Helen Keller, and others, besides the 
great example commemorated annually at this time, 
are briefly but feelingly touched upon in advocacy 
of the unselfish life of usefulness to the distressed 
and downtrodden. In its pleasing form, with deli- 
cate ornamentation and appropriate illustration, 
the book is well suited to gift purposes.

jSTOTES 



A novel by Mr. John Galsworthy entitled " The 
Freelands " is to be published serially in " Scrib- 
ner's Magazine," beginning in the January issue. 

Mr. William Wallace has prepared a sequel to 
his book, " The Threshold of Music," which is to be 
entitled " The Musical Faculty." It is a study of 
the psychological aspects of music. 

Mr. E. Alexander Powell, who has been serving 
in Belgium as the war correspondent of several 
American newspapers, is the author of " Fighting 
in Flanders," which Messrs. Scribner will publish 
shortly. 

Mr. Elbert Francis Baldwin is the author of a 
new book on the war in Europe. The work, which 
is to be called " The World War: How It Looks 
to the Nations Involved and What It Means to Us," 
is announced by the Macmillan Co. 

Mr. Gilbert Cannan is the author of a novel enti- 
tled " Young Earnest," which Messrs. D. Appleton 
& Co. announce for immediate publication. Mr. 
Compton Mackenzie's " Sinister Street," which has 
been delayed, may be expected simultaneously from 
the same publishers. 

A second volume of the essays of Treitschke, pre- 
senting his theory of a world policy and of the 
duty and mission of Prussia, is announced for 
publication in January by Messrs. Putnam. This 
house will also publish Mr. John Jay Chapman's 
book, " Deutschland iiber Alles." 

Three plays by Herr Arthur Schnitzler, " The 
Lonely Way," " Interlude," and " Countess Mizzi," 
are to be included in Volume XI. of the " Modern 
Drama Series " published by Mr. Mitchell Kenner- 
ley. Another book which may be expected at once 
from Mr. Kennerley is Mr. Sheldon Cheney's " The 
New Movement in the Theatre." 

" The Arya Samaj " is the title of a study of the 
movement active in Northern India during the past 
decade for the religious and social elevation of the 
people. The author is Mr. Lajput Rai, a promi- 
nent member of the society. The book, which will 
be published shortly by Messrs. Longmans, Green 
& Co., will have a Preface by Mr. Sidney Webb. 

" Builder and Blunderer " is the title of a critical 
study of Emperor William's character and reign by 
Mr. George Saunders. Mr. Saunders was corre- 
spondent of the London " Morning Post " in Berlin 
for ten years and later correspondent of the Lon- 
don " Times " in Berlin and in Paris. His book 
will be published at an early date by Messrs. E. P. 
Button & Co. 

An authority on naval strategy, and perhaps the 
most widely read writer on the subject of sea 
power that the world has ever known, Admiral 
Mahan, died on the first of this month at the naval 
hospital in Washington. Alfred Thayer Mahan, 
born at West Point, September 27, 1840, son of a 
professor in the U. S. Military Academy, chose the 
navy rather than the army in selecting his future 
calling, and was graduated from the Naval Acad- 
emy at Annapolis in 1859. He served in various 
capacities and with increasing honor in the Civil 
War, and afterward rendered useful service at sev- 



eral of our navy yards and as president of the 
Naval War College. Rising to the rank of captain 
in 1885, he retired in 1896, and was made a rear- 
admiral (retired) ten years later. He acted as dele- 
gate to the Hague Peace Conference in 1899, was 
president of the American Historical Association in 
1902-03, and enjoyed the distinction of membership 
in both the American Academy of Arts and Letters 
and the National Institute of Arts and Letters. 
The book that first made him famous and procured 
him worldwide recognition as an authority in his 
department of study was " The Influence of Sea 
Power upon History," which appeared in 1890, and 
was followed by kindred works of little less note. 
These writings gained for him the half-dozen or 
more academic degrees conferred by Oxford, Cam- 
bridge, Harvard, Yale, McGill, and Columbia. He 
wrote biographies of Farragut and Nelson, chap- 
ters of autobiography and reminiscence, and at 
least one serious work wholly removed from the 
interests and activities with which his name is 
commonly associated. We mean his book, " The 
Harvest Within: Thoughts on the Life of the 
Christian."

Lord Bryce has written to the 
editor of The Unpopular 

Review 



'Tis a long time since I have read 
anything so good in any review or 
magazine. . . . Almost too good 
for a serial. 

. . . To my great satisfaction 
people here were beginning to 
appreciate and enjoy it when the 
storm burst upon us. 

It is fresh, not hackneyed or con- 
ventional, and it is full of thinking, 
written not because something has 
to be said, but because the writers 
have something to say.

"To Crush to bend

those who oppose him; to 
live without sympathy, sen- 
timentality or tolerance; to 
dominate." Such was the 
creed which made Alex- 
ander Hendrie a millionaire 
wheat king. Read his stir- 
ring career in 



The Way Of 
The Strong 

by 

Ridgwell Cullum 



A man's book a woman's book 
a romance of conquest of de- 
ception, with a great moral lesson. 
A revelation of the motives under- 
lying labor agitations. But above 
all "The Way of the Strong" is 
the story of a man who drinks 
from the cup of virtue and from 
the jug of vice. It is the story of 
this man's love for his wife a 
love which stands out greater than 
all else in his life. It is the work 
of a thinker the masterpiece of 
a world-famous novelist. You 
will read it once only to read it 
again. Ask your bookseller for 
it to-day or order direct.
